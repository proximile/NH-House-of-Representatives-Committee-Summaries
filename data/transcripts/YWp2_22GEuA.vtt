00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
um I asked Marty to break this down but
 
00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
yeah email that
 
00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
car insurance this is basically the
 
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
change right here yep
 
00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 align:start position:0%
no change plus one and two point five
 
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 align:start position:0%
correct so you understand that yes no I
 
00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
let's make pictures for people let's
 
00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 align:start position:0%
make things well it takes a few days of
 
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 align:start position:0%
looking at it before you kind of wrap
 
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 align:start position:0%
your head around it but once you've
 
00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 align:start position:0%
wrapped your head around it then it
 
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 align:start position:0%
starts making sense
 
00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.990 align:start position:0%
starts making sense
mm-hmm

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 align:start position:0%
all right representative Pearson you
 
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'd like to thank everybody for being
 
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
here this morning thank you we are going
 
00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 align:start position:0%
to be looking at
 
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
um a an amendment that basically just
 
00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 align:start position:0%
completely replaces HB 436 by
 
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 align:start position:0%
happenstance do do we have a committee
 
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
researcher or a committee person
 
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 align:start position:0%
available that can run and grab some
 
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
copies of this amendment for folks since
 
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
it wasn't
 
00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 align:start position:0%
we have we have them how many do you
 
00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:28.610 align:start position:0%
we have we have them how many do you
need

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 align:start position:0%
ten okay I have five so that's not gonna
 
00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
quite cut it
 
00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
and you also have some input from Mr
 
00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
because I didn't get that
 
00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 align:start position:0%
the committee yesterday
 
00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:02.509 align:start position:0%
the committee yesterday
um

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:06.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
one to uh Chris and Peter while you're
 
00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 align:start position:0%
going by we came up earlier
 
00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
I lost mine I left the extra properties
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:57.830 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
stable we're looking at those like minor
 
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.830 align:start position:0%
stable we're looking at those like minor
things

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
a whole bunch of this should be bold
 
00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 align:start position:0%
that isn't bold
 
00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
as far as like the last pages because
 
00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 align:start position:0%
it's technically changes and it's all
 
00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
just in regular writing so somebody else
 
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
were to pick it up they would think that
 
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 align:start position:0%
and I've I've had to deal with this in
 
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 align:start position:0%
my three terms now
 
00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
is the Bold is in paragraphs where they
 
00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 align:start position:0%
make changes then they have a tendency
 
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:29.240 align:start position:0%
to not bold new language sometimes right
 
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know why that consistency lacks
 
00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 align:start position:0%
uh the last four pages if you just
 
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
picked it up you just assume it was in
 
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
statute yep exactly page 9 10 11 and 12
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
should all be bold I agree yeah
 
00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:06.189 align:start position:0%
 
Ness

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
um actually Steve well we're waiting for
 
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:12.600 align:start position:0%
Carol to come back Marty if you wouldn't
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
just mind uh well no because Kim's not
 
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 align:start position:0%
here and it would have been for her
 
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.909 align:start position:0%
here and it would have been for her
benefit

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
uh just to explain the how the 2.5 or
 
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
2.1 percent what that stuff means for
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
people who aren't reading this every day
 
00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 align:start position:0%
you know when they say like a 2.5
 
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:31.150 align:start position:0%
you know when they say like a 2.5
multiplier

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.730 align:start position:0%
 
Yeah

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 align:start position:0%
Yeah
 
00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:36.360 align:start position:0%
okay or whatever I know you're both on
 
00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:45.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
you might as well just sit with me
 
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:48.440 align:start position:0%
really I mean
 
00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:52.139 align:start position:0%
we haven't started yet the uh yeah you
 
00:05:53.749 --> 00:05:53.759 align:start position:0%
must have just sit with me just so wait
 
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
I'm still waiting for Carol to come back
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
turning around looking for me there she
 
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
is right exactly
 
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 align:start position:0%
so all right representative Pearson
 
00:06:02.749 --> 00:06:02.759 align:start position:0%
let's start digging into this sure
 
00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely right from page one where
 
00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:07.259 align:start position:0%
um basically we're taking what's already
 
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
in statute we're splitting it into group
 
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
one group two so okay so so back to to
 
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 align:start position:0%
your comment about bold
 
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
um like in the in the inconsistencies
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
that OLS does with Bolding lines five
 
00:06:22.249 --> 00:06:22.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 align:start position:0%
um they really should yep so I'm gonna
 
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
make when I when I bring this when we
 
00:06:29.809 --> 00:06:29.819 align:start position:0%
bring this back down to them we will ask
 
00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
I will mark this please make this bold
 
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
please make the other parts bold yep
 
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
but it's you know new language and the
 
00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 align:start position:0%
Preamble tells you its new language but
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
but anyway so based back when we had the
 
00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 align:start position:0%
the 2012 lawsuit
 
00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:47.749 align:start position:0%
the 2012 lawsuit
um

00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:49.249 --> 00:06:49.259 align:start position:0%
one of the things that came out of that
 
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 align:start position:0%
was the fact that the statute did not
 
00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:53.460 align:start position:0%
have a definition of the term vested
 
00:06:56.809 --> 00:06:56.819 align:start position:0%
it's referenced in the in the statute as
 
00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
far as qualifications for a benefit on
 
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
page like 90 something but not it's not
 
00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:04.139 align:start position:0%
in the definition list at the beginning
 
00:07:04.139 --> 00:07:07.249 align:start position:0%
in the definition list at the beginning
so

00:07:07.249 --> 00:07:07.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:09.479 align:start position:0%
looking at the the other New England
 
00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:11.100 align:start position:0%
states because we are in a competitive
 
00:07:13.309 --> 00:07:13.319 align:start position:0%
Regional labor market four of the six
 
00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:15.720 align:start position:0%
New England states vested five years
 
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:18.300 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts does not they vest at 10.
 
00:07:19.909 --> 00:07:19.919 align:start position:0%
we've always operated under the
 
00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:22.259 align:start position:0%
presumption of 10 the math calculations
 
00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
the debt everything is based off of of
 
00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.110 align:start position:0%
the debt everything is based off of of
10.

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
10.
 
00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:29.039 align:start position:0%
so in the interest of keeping that
 
00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:31.919 align:start position:0%
consistent and not causing a massive
 
00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:33.290 align:start position:0%
consistent and not causing a massive
upheaval

00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
upheaval
 
00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
just leave it at 10 for qualifications
 
00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:38.220 align:start position:0%
of a benefit but we have a serious trust
 
00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:41.220 align:start position:0%
problem in the fact that not only from a
 
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:43.620 align:start position:0%
reputation point but exteriorly to the
 
00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:45.539 align:start position:0%
state but within this state the fact
 
00:07:47.029 --> 00:07:47.039 align:start position:0%
that the legislature went through and
 
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:48.780 align:start position:0%
made changes for people that had 10
 
00:07:51.409 --> 00:07:51.419 align:start position:0%
years in so in the definition of vested
 
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
my request here is that or our request
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
is this is not just me this is a whole
 
00:07:58.430 --> 00:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of us that
 
00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:00.780 align:start position:0%
the two sections average final
 
00:08:03.290 --> 00:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
compensation and earnable comp be no
 
00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:05.580 align:start position:0%
there'll be no ability to reduce that
 
00:08:08.089 --> 00:08:08.099 align:start position:0%
after three years that is so that people
 
00:08:10.129 --> 00:08:10.139 align:start position:0%
can now have some sort of planning some
 
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
sort of idea of what's going on
 
00:08:14.689 --> 00:08:14.699 align:start position:0%
some sort of commitment from the state
 
00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:16.620 align:start position:0%
here that you know this is this is what
 
00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
you expect and this is what we expect in
 
00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:20.390 align:start position:0%
you expect and this is what we expect in
in

00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:08:22.430 --> 00:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
so basically after three years we can't
 
00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
go back and retroact anything exactly
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
and that's your four year five year six
 
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
year seven that is how we got into this
 
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:31.740 align:start position:0%
problem in the beginning so is it a
 
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
little bit more bold I suppose than
 
00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:37.800 align:start position:0%
say having a a tight definition of
 
00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
vested at five years it is
 
00:08:43.969 --> 00:08:43.979 align:start position:0%
but we've
 
00:08:46.310 --> 00:08:46.320 align:start position:0%
not taken the step of arguing for a
 
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
five-year vesting like Connecticut Rhode
 
00:08:50.269 --> 00:08:50.279 align:start position:0%
Island Maine and Vermont right we'll
 
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
still say you gotta we want a commitment
 
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
for workers to this to this political
 
00:08:55.790 --> 00:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
subdivisions in the state as well we
 
00:08:57.769 --> 00:08:57.779 align:start position:0%
what I don't want is for this to become
 
00:08:59.269 --> 00:08:59.279 align:start position:0%
a hey I'm going to do a five-year jot
 
00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:00.720 align:start position:0%
and I'm gone and hey I get a little bit
 
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:03.720 align:start position:0%
of something you know 35 years from now
 
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:06.120 align:start position:0%
we we want people to have careers and
 
00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.009 align:start position:0%
we we want people to have careers and
that's

00:09:07.009 --> 00:09:07.019 align:start position:0%
that's
 
00:09:09.650 --> 00:09:09.660 align:start position:0%
that's why keeping it as a 10-year
 
00:09:12.769 --> 00:09:12.779 align:start position:0%
minimum denotes that that we want people
 
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
to have careers this isn't just a fling
 
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:16.310 align:start position:0%
to have careers this isn't just a fling
job

00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:16.320 align:start position:0%
job
 
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:19.200 align:start position:0%
right that makes sense uh any questions
 
00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:21.300 align:start position:0%
on that from yes representative
 
00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:23.490 align:start position:0%
I might as well leave my mic on
 
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.829 align:start position:0%
I might as well leave my mic on
[Laughter]

00:09:24.829 --> 00:09:24.839 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:09:26.090 --> 00:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
well we can only have three of us
 
00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative I think I know what best
 
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:32.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:35.880 align:start position:0%
I work for a company and in 10 years my
 
00:09:39.050 --> 00:09:39.060 align:start position:0%
stock options are vested they're mine
 
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:41.220 align:start position:0%
now but they weren't mine at nine years
 
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:42.769 align:start position:0%
now but they weren't mine at nine years
right

00:09:42.769 --> 00:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:44.700 align:start position:0%
what are we talking about what can't be
 
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:46.920 align:start position:0%
reduced after three years the the
 
00:09:48.110 --> 00:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
agreement that they had when they
 
00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
started so say we were going to give you
 
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.200 align:start position:0%
a specific plan when you started all
 
00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:54.140 align:start position:0%
right and then you've worked three years
 
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:56.820 align:start position:0%
once you reached that third year mark we
 
00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:58.500 align:start position:0%
can't change that plan on you anymore
 
00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
what you agreed to originally it's about
 
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
the formula yeah the way that we got
 
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
into the problem that we're in right now
 
00:10:05.269 --> 00:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
is some people had worked nine and a
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
half years with a with an agreement in
 
00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
place they thought that they were
 
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
getting a benefit and then we came in
 
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:13.620 align:start position:0%
and said no just kidding you never had
 
00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
that benefit so the way that I like to
 
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:16.800 align:start position:0%
explain it's kind of like you come to
 
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
work for me and I agree to pay you 30 an
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
hour and I'm paying you thirty dollars
 
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:22.260 align:start position:0%
an hour and then nine and a half years
 
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
later I come and say just kidding it was
 
00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:26.339 align:start position:0%
15 an hour no by the way you got to give
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
me that fifteen dollars back it's not a
 
00:10:29.329 --> 00:10:29.339 align:start position:0%
hundred percent the same way but it's
 
00:10:32.350 --> 00:10:32.360 align:start position:0%
it's kind of that idea that's not really
 
00:10:35.630 --> 00:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
that's not a bad a good choice it's it's
 
00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
only about the the pension benefits they
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
can't change your pension benefit after
 
00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:45.000 align:start position:0%
you have worked for three years so if
 
00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:46.740 align:start position:0%
you work for two and a half years and
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
they say your pension is now half of
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
what it was
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
that's it for three years your pension
 
00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.670 align:start position:0%
that's it for three years your pension
benefit

00:10:54.670 --> 00:10:54.680 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
calculation is Frozen it's frozen
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
I I and I think that might be a good
 
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
thing to put in to make it more explicit
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about the pension
 
00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:06.170 align:start position:0%
that you're talking about the pension
benefit

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:06.180 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
well it does it references both
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
paragraphs specifically this is both of
 
00:11:12.769 --> 00:11:12.779 align:start position:0%
them um so um I'll ask Marty to explain
 
00:11:15.470 --> 00:11:15.480 align:start position:0%
also what what as far as what you're
 
00:11:17.329 --> 00:11:17.339 align:start position:0%
entitled to
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
if you as far as like employee
 
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:21.360 align:start position:0%
contribution and that kind of thing yeah
 
00:11:23.750 --> 00:11:23.760 align:start position:0%
sure um so a little bit of background
 
00:11:27.050 --> 00:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
vesting in in retirement system you know
 
00:11:29.509 --> 00:11:29.519 align:start position:0%
parlance is once you've completed 10
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
years of creditable service you've
 
00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:34.260 align:start position:0%
earned the right to a future benefit so
 
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:36.540 align:start position:0%
whether you work another 10 20 30 years
 
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:38.100 align:start position:0%
or whether you stop working and then
 
00:11:39.889 --> 00:11:39.899 align:start position:0%
come back to us when you're eligible by
 
00:11:42.530 --> 00:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
age for that benefit you're vested as
 
00:11:44.269 --> 00:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
long as you keep your contributions with
 
00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:45.720 align:start position:0%
us you can come back to us when you're
 
00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
eligible to collect a benefit and get
 
00:11:49.850 --> 00:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
something based on your term of service
 
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
and your salary during that time so so
 
00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
that's that's what vesting means you
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
know for us and back in 2011 when the
 
00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
legislature you know opened up the
 
00:12:02.509 --> 00:12:02.519 align:start position:0%
retirement system and made a lot of
 
00:12:02.519 --> 00:12:04.130 align:start position:0%
retirement system and made a lot of
changes

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:04.140 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
um that that legislature at the time
 
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:08.940 align:start position:0%
drew the line at vested anybody who was
 
00:12:11.449 --> 00:12:11.459 align:start position:0%
not in the system less than 10 years uh
 
00:12:12.949 --> 00:12:12.959 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of opinions on how that
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
was adjudicated in court behind me
 
00:12:17.630 --> 00:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
um and I'm not here to comment on you
 
00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:19.260 align:start position:0%
know I'm not a lawyer and and wouldn't
 
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:21.180 align:start position:0%
interpret that but you know so that
 
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:23.940 align:start position:0%
that's the line that legislature Drew
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
um this this provision here would freeze
 
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860 align:start position:0%
that after three years of service if
 
00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
there were future changes if you were
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
going to increase the member
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
contribution rates which is for example
 
00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:37.140 align:start position:0%
right now for fire it's 11.8 percent of
 
00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:39.600 align:start position:0%
pay if a future legislature wanted to
 
00:12:41.210 --> 00:12:41.220 align:start position:0%
increase that to 12 and a half percent
 
00:12:43.550 --> 00:12:43.560 align:start position:0%
of pay again just for for the sake of
 
00:12:45.949 --> 00:12:45.959 align:start position:0%
argument this provision would prevent
 
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:47.820 align:start position:0%
that change from affecting anybody who
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
had three or more years in the system
 
00:12:52.370 --> 00:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
you know when that change was enacted so
 
00:12:53.750 --> 00:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
it would affect those people with less
 
00:12:56.090 --> 00:12:56.100 align:start position:0%
than three years in future hires is that
 
00:12:58.930 --> 00:12:58.940 align:start position:0%
your understanding representative
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
poke me if I'm saying anything that you
 
00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
think is incorrect so okay but also so
 
00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:06.180 align:start position:0%
one second real quick so you mentioned
 
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:08.160 align:start position:0%
there the contribution rate wouldn't
 
00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:09.110 align:start position:0%
there the contribution rate wouldn't
change

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.610 align:start position:0%
change
either

00:13:10.610 --> 00:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
either
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
change because that paragraph's not
 
00:13:13.970 --> 00:13:13.980 align:start position:0%
covered okay okay I was going to say
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
because that could cut both ways bad
 
00:13:18.710 --> 00:13:18.720 align:start position:0%
example so the the number of years you
 
00:13:20.810 --> 00:13:20.820 align:start position:0%
need to work to retire right is it
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
better example you know it's that that
 
00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:24.420 align:start position:0%
makes sense I'm sorry no no that's fine
 
00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
I want to restrict the contribution to
 
00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
be potentially flexible in case we have
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
a a problem so that's not restricted
 
00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
um the other thing to answer your
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
question representative true is has to
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
do with the what the employee puts in
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
from day one if they don't make ten
 
00:13:42.889 --> 00:13:42.899 align:start position:0%
years and if you can cover what they get
 
00:13:45.050 --> 00:13:45.060 align:start position:0%
back if they leave yeah sure thing so if
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
a member leaves service
 
00:13:48.949 --> 00:13:48.959 align:start position:0%
um before vesting so they don't have 10
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
Years yet they've worked you know one
 
00:13:52.009 --> 00:13:52.019 align:start position:0%
year or nine years or whatever the case
 
00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:54.899 align:start position:0%
may be uh they have the choice to take a
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
refund of their accumulated
 
00:13:58.850 --> 00:13:58.860 align:start position:0%
contributions plus interest credited on
 
00:14:00.590 --> 00:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
it you know during their period of
 
00:14:03.050 --> 00:14:03.060 align:start position:0%
service as a lump sum they can take that
 
00:14:05.509 --> 00:14:05.519 align:start position:0%
as a um you know a check from us and pay
 
00:14:07.250 --> 00:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
the take the tax hit or they could roll
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
it over into a qualified retirement plan
 
00:14:13.670 --> 00:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
um they don't have to if somebody works
 
00:14:16.730 --> 00:14:16.740 align:start position:0%
nine years and has to leave employment
 
00:14:18.290 --> 00:14:18.300 align:start position:0%
for whatever reason whether they were
 
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
laid off or they had a life issue
 
00:14:21.170 --> 00:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
they're dealing with a family thing or
 
00:14:23.090 --> 00:14:23.100 align:start position:0%
whatever if they kept their money with
 
00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:25.380 align:start position:0%
us that would preserve their nine years
 
00:14:27.110 --> 00:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
of service and their original hire date
 
00:14:28.610 --> 00:14:28.620 align:start position:0%
if they came back in another position
 
00:14:30.889 --> 00:14:30.899 align:start position:0%
and worked a few more years you know to
 
00:14:32.690 --> 00:14:32.700 align:start position:0%
vest you know they could still do that
 
00:14:34.970 --> 00:14:34.980 align:start position:0%
so so our we call them terminated
 
00:14:37.730 --> 00:14:37.740 align:start position:0%
members they're not active anymore but
 
00:14:38.990 --> 00:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
they still have money with us and
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
there's there's
 
00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
um uh several people there they would
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
still get interest on those
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
contributions at the same rate as active
 
00:14:47.269 --> 00:14:47.279 align:start position:0%
members while they have the money with
 
00:14:49.610 --> 00:14:49.620 align:start position:0%
us but basically if somebody worked five
 
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:51.660 align:start position:0%
years and took their money out they're
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
no longer a member they never existed in
 
00:14:57.050 --> 00:14:57.060 align:start position:0%
nhrs view you know for the purposes of
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
retirement if they came back and took
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
another job that would be their initial
 
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
higher date and they'd be subject to
 
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:03.600 align:start position:0%
whatever the plan Provisions were at the
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:07.079 --> 00:15:08.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:08.880 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
anyone so
 
00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:12.590 align:start position:0%
anyone so
um

00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:16.009 --> 00:15:16.019 align:start position:0%
I worked nine years and now I'm gonna go
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
I can take out what I put in not my
 
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
employer correct whatever I put in
 
00:15:30.550 --> 00:15:30.560 align:start position:0%
and I can reinvest that somewhere else
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
or I could leave it there
 
00:15:36.889 --> 00:15:36.899 align:start position:0%
and at some future date I'll get a small
 
00:15:36.899 --> 00:15:37.970 align:start position:0%
and at some future date I'll get a small
pension

00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
pension
 
00:15:40.490 --> 00:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
not not unless you return to service and
 
00:15:43.009 --> 00:15:43.019 align:start position:0%
got at least 10 years in
 
00:15:44.870 --> 00:15:44.880 align:start position:0%
um you know so you know if somebody is
 
00:15:46.730 --> 00:15:46.740 align:start position:0%
not planning to come back they worked
 
00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
eight years and they own their own
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
business now and they're never coming
 
00:15:51.170 --> 00:15:51.180 align:start position:0%
back if they keep their money with us or
 
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:52.940 align:start position:0%
almost treating it as a savings account
 
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:55.260 align:start position:0%
is there a time limit on that does it
 
00:15:57.530 --> 00:15:57.540 align:start position:0%
does the system eventually cash it out
 
00:16:00.050 --> 00:16:00.060 align:start position:0%
without you but that was repealed about
 
00:16:02.449 --> 00:16:02.459 align:start position:0%
20 years ago by the legislature it's
 
00:16:04.730 --> 00:16:04.740 align:start position:0%
just if if I'm
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
if I'm not going to get a small pension
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
from that nine years put in why would I
 
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:13.220 align:start position:0%
leave the money
 
00:16:16.189 --> 00:16:16.199 align:start position:0%
for a couple of reasons the first reason
 
00:16:18.230 --> 00:16:18.240 align:start position:0%
is you think you might come back to work
 
00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
at some point in which case you really
 
00:16:23.930 --> 00:16:23.940 align:start position:0%
want you really want to keep your
 
00:16:26.990 --> 00:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
starting date and the conditions
 
00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.370 align:start position:0%
starting date and the conditions
and

00:16:28.370 --> 00:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:30.480 align:start position:0%
and your contributions will have grown
 
00:16:32.870 --> 00:16:32.880 align:start position:0%
so you will be in that way you'll
 
00:16:35.629 --> 00:16:35.639 align:start position:0%
capture the nine years of employer
 
00:16:38.389 --> 00:16:38.399 align:start position:0%
contributions as well correct so if you
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
if you have even a small chance of
 
00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
coming back to work for the state it
 
00:16:45.710 --> 00:16:45.720 align:start position:0%
will be worth it to have an earlier
 
00:16:47.990 --> 00:16:48.000 align:start position:0%
start date and nine years of accumulated
 
00:16:50.629 --> 00:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
contributions a great example of this is
 
00:16:52.610 --> 00:16:52.620 align:start position:0%
is a teacher who becomes pregnant and
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
takes 10 years off to raise their
 
00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:55.920 align:start position:0%
children and then comes back to teach
 
00:16:58.509 --> 00:16:58.519 align:start position:0%
that that's probably the most common
 
00:17:01.370 --> 00:17:01.380 align:start position:0%
example of how that occurs it's not
 
00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
really dot workers or folks like that
 
00:17:05.929 --> 00:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
but it but especially within teachers
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
um that it's in essence they can pause
 
00:17:11.590 --> 00:17:11.600 align:start position:0%
and and compared to what we have now
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
that is new
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
no it is it's been there since the
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
beginning just the just the definition
 
00:17:20.390 --> 00:17:20.400 align:start position:0%
the definition wasn't in statute so we
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
were yeah we were working as if it were
 
00:17:25.130 --> 00:17:25.140 align:start position:0%
in statute almost um under the
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
assumption that that was the case but
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
they're just putting it in there now so
 
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
that we have something technical to work
 
00:17:30.059 --> 00:17:31.549 align:start position:0%
that we have something technical to work
with

00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
with
 
00:17:33.830 --> 00:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
yes Kim representative here
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:39.299 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:41.750 --> 00:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
so representative Pearson do I
 
00:17:44.210 --> 00:17:44.220 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly that the there
 
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
is no change on the the vesting that
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing it's just putting
 
00:17:51.110 --> 00:17:51.120 align:start position:0%
it in there as to what it what defining
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
it that's not that would not be entirely
 
00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
accurate the 10-year qualification for a
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
benefit is no change that is the
 
00:17:58.490 --> 00:17:58.500 align:start position:0%
presumption well it's not a presumption
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
because the qualifications for benefit
 
00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:01.860 align:start position:0%
at 10 years is in the statute it's just
 
00:18:04.610 --> 00:18:04.620 align:start position:0%
not defined it occurs
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
like an A5 I think it's referenced in in
 
00:18:10.070 --> 00:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
both accidental disability and now
 
00:18:13.250 --> 00:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
vested deferred retirement it's so it's
 
00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:15.780 align:start position:0%
you know and possible and then in the
 
00:18:17.210 --> 00:18:17.220 align:start position:0%
debt in the death benefits it you know
 
00:18:19.789 --> 00:18:19.799 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's it's it's it's reference
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
elsewhere in the statute where it's
 
00:18:24.529 --> 00:18:24.539 align:start position:0%
applicable but it was never added to the
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
definitions at the beginning but it's
 
00:18:28.669 --> 00:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
it's and that's that's how it's inferred
 
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:32.100 align:start position:0%
and been and also too since it's under
 
00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:35.400 align:start position:0%
those three specific sections this under
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
definitions would just make it a CR in
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
the entire document rather than because
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
you could interpret it that it only
 
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:43.140 align:start position:0%
applies to the the paragraphs in which
 
00:18:45.169 --> 00:18:45.179 align:start position:0%
it exists which is part of the problem
 
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:48.900 align:start position:0%
we had in the court case in 20 2012.
 
00:18:51.409 --> 00:18:51.419 align:start position:0%
it also it also adds the three-year and
 
00:18:52.909 --> 00:18:52.919 align:start position:0%
that's the second part that's the
 
00:18:56.270 --> 00:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
three-year part is new
 
00:18:58.490 --> 00:18:58.500 align:start position:0%
yeah sure
 
00:19:01.370 --> 00:19:01.380 align:start position:0%
thank you so
 
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
I asked Marty to provide me with some
 
00:19:06.289 --> 00:19:06.299 align:start position:0%
real life examples so that we could
 
00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:08.820 align:start position:0%
understand this and so in I know that
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
you have a copy of this um one second
 
00:19:11.870 --> 00:19:11.880 align:start position:0%
Tim uh we're going to come back to that
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
later thanks yep yeah we'll get chopped
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
this up we'll get Section by section
 
00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.529 align:start position:0%
this up we'll get Section by section
yep

00:19:18.529 --> 00:19:18.539 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:19:21.070 --> 00:19:21.080 align:start position:0%
so that's that is
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say that this simply
 
00:19:27.049 --> 00:19:27.059 align:start position:0%
puts the assumed definition of vested
 
00:19:29.870 --> 00:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
among the definitions and then adds a
 
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
new clause about the three years after
 
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:33.780 align:start position:0%
three years you can't mess with these
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
two calculations correct okay yep
 
00:19:42.230 --> 00:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
that that was a back that was a a back
 
00:19:44.930 --> 00:19:44.940 align:start position:0%
office ask of a judge
 
00:19:44.940 --> 00:19:46.370 align:start position:0%
office ask of a judge
to

00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
to Define it please define it and I'm
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
shocked that it took us a decade frankly
 
00:19:54.470 --> 00:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
to to do it so Now's the Time so after
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
that after we get past that part
 
00:19:58.669 --> 00:19:58.679 align:start position:0%
um we go into splitting group one from
 
00:20:00.169 --> 00:20:00.179 align:start position:0%
group two correct
 
00:20:02.570 --> 00:20:02.580 align:start position:0%
um if you look at line 10 group one it's
 
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
basically the definition that's on the
 
00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
Statue right now but it's just siphoning
 
00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
it off group two so that we can do
 
00:20:08.029 --> 00:20:08.039 align:start position:0%
something different with group two
 
00:20:09.830 --> 00:20:09.840 align:start position:0%
correct that paragraph does have a
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
request from retirement to remove line
 
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:15.720 align:start position:0%
21 that sentence slightly before and
 
00:20:17.570 --> 00:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
after 21 because it is irrelevant to
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
group one it's a language cleanup thing
 
00:20:21.650 --> 00:20:21.660 align:start position:0%
that's a specific thing to group two so
 
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:22.980 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't be there right that's at
 
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
their request so that's fine yep that
 
00:20:28.909 --> 00:20:28.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:31.250 --> 00:20:31.260 align:start position:0%
um similarly to if if I can keep going
 
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
because we haven't ended the paragraph
 
00:20:34.850 --> 00:20:34.860 align:start position:0%
it runs over into page two yes similarly
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
line one permanent firemen line two
 
00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:37.860 align:start position:0%
permanent policeman does not need to be
 
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:39.240 align:start position:0%
in a group one definition because they
 
00:20:41.029 --> 00:20:41.039 align:start position:0%
are not in group one right same request
 
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
from retirement and what was the what
 
00:20:46.070 --> 00:20:46.080 align:start position:0%
was the purpose uh in line
 
00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:50.100 align:start position:0%
um 25 for striking the compensation part
 
00:20:52.850 --> 00:20:52.860 align:start position:0%
which page uh two page two oh the
 
00:20:54.669 --> 00:20:54.679 align:start position:0%
purpose of that is because
 
00:20:58.010 --> 00:20:58.020 align:start position:0%
you have what it says is
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
in this paragraph do what's in the next
 
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
paragraph well the next paragraph tells
 
00:21:04.490 --> 00:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
you to do it so it's it's just
 
00:21:07.610 --> 00:21:07.620 align:start position:0%
completely redundant okay
 
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:10.220 align:start position:0%
it does
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
uh yeah because uh online
 
00:21:15.470 --> 00:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
uh what does it starts at the end of
 
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
line 20. the reference to extra and
 
00:21:19.909 --> 00:21:19.919 align:start position:0%
special duty pay that's specifically a
 
00:21:21.409 --> 00:21:21.419 align:start position:0%
pay available only to the group two
 
00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:23.640 align:start position:0%
members so a reference the extra
 
00:21:25.549 --> 00:21:25.559 align:start position:0%
inspection or special Duty and special
 
00:21:27.230 --> 00:21:27.240 align:start position:0%
Duty pays are relevant to group one
 
00:21:28.970 --> 00:21:28.980 align:start position:0%
because they're not right under current
 
00:21:30.890 --> 00:21:30.900 align:start position:0%
law they you know they don't get it so
 
00:21:32.870 --> 00:21:32.880 align:start position:0%
that is a request to remove for a
 
00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:35.100 align:start position:0%
language cleanup online 20. yep yeah
 
00:21:36.230 --> 00:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
there's there's I mean there's a bunch
 
00:21:37.310 --> 00:21:37.320 align:start position:0%
of that I'm not sure that we have to hit
 
00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
all of those necessarily at line 27 on
 
00:21:41.090 --> 00:21:41.100 align:start position:0%
page three teachers employees that
 
00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't need to be in there there's
 
00:21:45.649 --> 00:21:45.659 align:start position:0%
there's a few of them that overlaps but
 
00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:47.280 align:start position:0%
um if any member of the committee would
 
00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
like to see the highlighted version from
 
00:21:51.710 --> 00:21:51.720 align:start position:0%
nhrs we have one with all of those
 
00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
little extra special Duty doesn't belong
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
in here because it's group two and
 
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
there's no sensitive change to the to
 
00:22:00.770 --> 00:22:00.780 align:start position:0%
policy right cost or procedure just
 
00:22:02.630 --> 00:22:02.640 align:start position:0%
doing a better job separating group one
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
and group two than I than I did when I
 
00:22:12.890 --> 00:22:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:14.270 --> 00:22:14.280 align:start position:0%
that was factor or the benefits for
 
00:22:15.890 --> 00:22:15.900 align:start position:0%
anybody right yeah no I noticed them
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
last night when I was going through it
 
00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
as well just
 
00:22:20.620 --> 00:22:20.630 align:start position:0%
things here and there
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:21.169 align:start position:0%
things here and there
[Music]

00:22:21.169 --> 00:22:21.179 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:22:21.179 --> 00:22:22.430 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

00:22:22.430 --> 00:22:22.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how much time the committee
 
00:22:25.190 --> 00:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
has spent looking at the document any
 
00:22:31.330 --> 00:22:31.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:34.190 --> 00:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
yes representative true
 
00:22:36.529 --> 00:22:36.539 align:start position:0%
for me personally
 
00:22:36.539 --> 00:22:37.549 align:start position:0%
for me personally
um

00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:39.289 --> 00:22:39.299 align:start position:0%
what I want hope to get from this
 
00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:41.700 align:start position:0%
meeting is not an understanding of of
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
the pension system because we'd have to
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
be here a little bit longer than my
 
00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:48.059 align:start position:0%
lifetime exists what I need to know is
 
00:22:51.110 --> 00:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
what's different sure that that's what
 
00:22:53.210 --> 00:22:53.220 align:start position:0%
I'm that's what I want to cause
 
00:22:55.669 --> 00:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
the way it is now because of the changes
 
00:22:59.169 --> 00:22:59.179 align:start position:0%
from 10 years ago whenever yep
 
00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:01.700 align:start position:0%
what's the difference what's the cost
 
00:23:03.770 --> 00:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
that's that's what I'm that's what I'm
 
00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
looking for sure starting on page three
 
00:23:12.169 --> 00:23:12.179 align:start position:0%
yep just so page three is is where the
 
00:23:12.179 --> 00:23:13.850 align:start position:0%
yep just so page three is is where the
split

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:13.860 align:start position:0%
split
 
00:23:16.250 --> 00:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
um really comes in you know so that and
 
00:23:17.990 --> 00:23:18.000 align:start position:0%
that's why it's bold so the so to
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
separate group one and group two we have
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
to add another paragraph to create the
 
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:23.510 align:start position:0%
to add another paragraph to create the
split

00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
split
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
so in here um there was removal
 
00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
because it if you look at it literally
 
00:23:30.230 --> 00:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
word for word references to teachers the
 
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
university teaching system doesn't need
 
00:23:33.289 --> 00:23:33.299 align:start position:0%
to be in there
 
00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
um that the end of line 10 needs to come
 
00:23:38.330 --> 00:23:38.340 align:start position:0%
out because we don't do that line page
 
00:23:41.390 --> 00:23:41.400 align:start position:0%
State yep line 27 where it says employee
 
00:23:43.010 --> 00:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
teachers that at the request of
 
00:23:45.049 --> 00:23:45.059 align:start position:0%
retirement will come out so just for
 
00:23:47.630 --> 00:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
just for clarification purposes too what
 
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
this does representative true if you
 
00:23:50.450 --> 00:23:50.460 align:start position:0%
look at the first line on line seven it
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
says status prior to January 1st 2013
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
that used to say January 1st 2012. okay
 
00:23:59.450 --> 00:23:59.460 align:start position:0%
and then this whole paragraph this whole
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
explanation or definition
 
00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:05.000 align:start position:0%
um of what calculates into their benefit
 
00:24:08.450 --> 00:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
is exactly what it was before we made
 
00:24:10.549 --> 00:24:10.559 align:start position:0%
the change to the new system so it's
 
00:24:13.610 --> 00:24:13.620 align:start position:0%
reverting people for that year back to
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
the old system of retirement pay their
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
old package correct their original
 
00:24:18.770 --> 00:24:18.780 align:start position:0%
package their original plan they had
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
when they were hired the one that they
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
had when they were hired so this just
 
00:24:24.890 --> 00:24:24.900 align:start position:0%
brings one year one one year of people
 
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:27.059 align:start position:0%
the last year the year that should be
 
00:24:29.330 --> 00:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
retiring right now and says that they
 
00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
can retire right now
 
00:24:33.649 --> 00:24:33.659 align:start position:0%
with the package that they were promised
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:40.740 align:start position:0%
yes Carol
 
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
sorry representative
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
we can be informal uh I'm concerned
 
00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:48.500 align:start position:0%
about that because that is essentially
 
00:24:51.770 --> 00:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
telling everybody that
 
00:24:55.430 --> 00:24:55.440 align:start position:0%
was at the nine plus years in 2011 that
 
00:24:59.149 --> 00:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
they can retire right now and if I
 
00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:01.860 align:start position:0%
accept except it doesn't because the if
 
00:25:04.490 --> 00:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
the effective date of this
 
00:25:07.490 --> 00:25:07.500 align:start position:0%
is out
 
00:25:09.529 --> 00:25:09.539 align:start position:0%
and it's actually going to require an
 
00:25:12.710 --> 00:25:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:15.649 --> 00:25:15.659 align:start position:0%
okay so this is section
 
00:25:15.659 --> 00:25:18.950 align:start position:0%
okay so this is section
one

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:22.909 --> 00:25:22.919 align:start position:0%
take effect January 2024 so that we
 
00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
should expect on January 1st 2024 a wave
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
of retirements of people that were in
 
00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:31.020 align:start position:0%
this group not necessarily it gives them
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
the option it's it certainly doesn't
 
00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:34.620 align:start position:0%
tell them to do that
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
but it gives them the option sure as it
 
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
would them just reaching the goal or the
 
00:25:44.269 --> 00:25:44.279 align:start position:0%
the qualifications to retire well I I
 
00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
happen to be have been working at
 
00:25:48.470 --> 00:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
Lockheed when they implemented a change
 
00:25:51.549 --> 00:25:51.559 align:start position:0%
to the retirement system
 
00:25:55.730 --> 00:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
and oh a significant fraction of people
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
that were planning to work in other year
 
00:26:01.130 --> 00:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
or three or five said
 
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
oh if I work longer I'm going to be my
 
00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.080 align:start position:0%
benefit will be decreased so I'm
 
00:26:10.130 --> 00:26:10.140 align:start position:0%
retiring right now and we lost
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
hundreds of people that month because
 
00:26:14.810 --> 00:26:14.820 align:start position:0%
they decide they calculated that it
 
00:26:17.149 --> 00:26:17.159 align:start position:0%
would be better off to retire now than
 
00:26:19.190 --> 00:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
to work another year or two so this
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
forces a year they could actually leave
 
00:26:24.110 --> 00:26:24.120 align:start position:0%
right now they would just leave under
 
00:26:26.450 --> 00:26:26.460 align:start position:0%
the current calculation so there's an
 
00:26:29.090 --> 00:26:29.100 align:start position:0%
incredible incentive for them to to give
 
00:26:31.430 --> 00:26:31.440 align:start position:0%
an additional year of service and under
 
00:26:35.330 --> 00:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
the current statute the value to stay is
 
00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:36.590 align:start position:0%
the current statute the value to stay is
less

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:36.600 align:start position:0%
less
 
00:26:39.710 --> 00:26:39.720 align:start position:0%
than the change so so the carrot is
 
00:26:42.649 --> 00:26:42.659 align:start position:0%
there to say if you keep going it's
 
00:26:44.390 --> 00:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
worth more to stay than it used to be
 
00:26:46.370 --> 00:26:46.380 align:start position:0%
and that's what we're trying to do is as
 
00:26:48.769 --> 00:26:48.779 align:start position:0%
you're well aware the it's the longer
 
00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:50.340 align:start position:0%
someone works the better it is for the
 
00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
system thank you for pointing that out
 
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.590 align:start position:0%
system thank you for pointing that out
yep

00:26:54.590 --> 00:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
I may have to say so I totally agree
 
00:27:01.250 --> 00:27:01.260 align:start position:0%
with you that that will act as that
 
00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:04.500 align:start position:0%
incentive that you've just described but
 
00:27:06.529 --> 00:27:06.539 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire's point was that
 
00:27:10.310 --> 00:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
next year we're very likely to see that
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
wave because people are I think that's
 
00:27:14.330 --> 00:27:14.340 align:start position:0%
what's going to happen but people will
 
00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:18.299 align:start position:0%
say I can retire now with what has been
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
promised and they can't yank the rug out
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
from underneath me once I've retired
 
00:27:23.279 --> 00:27:24.289 align:start position:0%
from underneath me once I've retired
because

00:27:24.289 --> 00:27:24.299 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:27:26.930 --> 00:27:26.940 align:start position:0%
that's locked in at that point so I I do
 
00:27:28.730 --> 00:27:28.740 align:start position:0%
think we have we're good we have to
 
00:27:30.529 --> 00:27:30.539 align:start position:0%
anticipate that we'll see a wave sure
 
00:27:33.289 --> 00:27:33.299 align:start position:0%
and not a guarantee right take it well
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
and I I don't I want to be careful not
 
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:37.200 align:start position:0%
to isolate just that first year either
 
00:27:38.990 --> 00:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
because the chart stretches out farther
 
00:27:41.210 --> 00:27:41.220 align:start position:0%
than just the first year sure and and so
 
00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:43.620 align:start position:0%
you're incentivizing future years to to
 
00:27:45.289 --> 00:27:45.299 align:start position:0%
stay on as well
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
um when they might just stop to get out
 
00:27:46.799 --> 00:27:48.289 align:start position:0%
um when they might just stop to get out
earlier

00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
00:27:50.750 --> 00:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
um so we are with what this amendment
 
00:27:53.690 --> 00:27:53.700 align:start position:0%
does I think actually is systematically
 
00:27:56.810 --> 00:27:56.820 align:start position:0%
spreads out the risk of departure rather
 
00:27:58.549 --> 00:27:58.559 align:start position:0%
than I think we actually maybe run a
 
00:28:01.190 --> 00:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
higher risk of a larger departure so
 
00:28:03.409 --> 00:28:03.419 align:start position:0%
earlier in the trial in the trouble
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
called the trottier bill I forget the
 
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
number 549 or whatever it was that that
 
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
would have happened because you would
 
00:28:12.350 --> 00:28:12.360 align:start position:0%
have instantaneously moved a decades
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
worth of people
 
00:28:17.269 --> 00:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
immediately to to a retirement point
 
00:28:19.669 --> 00:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
where you would see a mass Exodus this
 
00:28:21.470 --> 00:28:21.480 align:start position:0%
this goes in the other direction and
 
00:28:23.810 --> 00:28:23.820 align:start position:0%
says no because we don't we don't want
 
00:28:26.390 --> 00:28:26.400 align:start position:0%
that to happen now keep in mind
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
as of February 1st
 
00:28:32.149 --> 00:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
last week the first group of folks could
 
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:34.020 align:start position:0%
start to exit we could have the mass
 
00:28:36.169 --> 00:28:36.179 align:start position:0%
Exodus anyway
 
00:28:38.029 --> 00:28:38.039 align:start position:0%
and there are probably some folks that
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
are so burned out that they're not going
 
00:28:42.169 --> 00:28:42.179 align:start position:0%
to wait that year but this is this is a
 
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
substantial carrot to say please please
 
00:28:47.210 --> 00:28:47.220 align:start position:0%
keep working and this is what we're
 
00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:49.620 align:start position:0%
gonna because because of the abundance
 
00:28:51.169 --> 00:28:51.179 align:start position:0%
of things but the majority being the
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
labor market that we have and also too
 
00:28:54.049 --> 00:28:54.059 align:start position:0%
by forcing someone to work that
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
additional year it's better for the
 
00:28:55.679 --> 00:28:56.450 align:start position:0%
additional year it's better for the
system

00:28:56.450 --> 00:28:56.460 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
because they're not withdrawing a
 
00:28:59.570 --> 00:28:59.580 align:start position:0%
benefit they're actually putting money
 
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
into the system
 
00:29:06.549 --> 00:29:06.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
sure but I mean at some point regardless
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
of where you were to draw a line that's
 
00:29:14.029 --> 00:29:14.039 align:start position:0%
going to happen at some point anyway so
 
00:29:16.490 --> 00:29:16.500 align:start position:0%
either we either we get them to stay the
 
00:29:18.230 --> 00:29:18.240 align:start position:0%
year or we do nothing and we see a mass
 
00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:21.240 align:start position:0%
Exodus without the care from my
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
perspective on this without the carrot
 
00:29:23.750 --> 00:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
they just leave sooner they just leave
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
sooner they just leave sooner
 
00:29:25.559 --> 00:29:29.870 align:start position:0%
sooner they just leave sooner
so

00:29:29.870 --> 00:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:33.169 --> 00:29:33.179 align:start position:0%
um so so on page four section D because
 
00:29:34.610 --> 00:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
just correct me if I just for
 
00:29:37.070 --> 00:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
clarifications for purposes Steve this
 
00:29:40.190 --> 00:29:40.200 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't change
 
00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:41.630 align:start position:0%
this bill doesn't change
the

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:43.789 --> 00:29:43.799 align:start position:0%
um when somebody can retire in group two
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
it just incentives up incentivizes them
 
00:29:48.590 --> 00:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
to stay longer if they want a higher
 
00:29:50.630 --> 00:29:50.640 align:start position:0%
pension correct so they can they can
 
00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:52.200 align:start position:0%
still retire when they were gonna be
 
00:29:54.169 --> 00:29:54.179 align:start position:0%
able to retire they'll just take the the
 
00:29:56.210 --> 00:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
package they're on now they won't get
 
00:29:57.950 --> 00:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
the new new package that's proposed in
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
this that is why I wrote it right this
 
00:30:01.490 --> 00:30:01.500 align:start position:0%
way that is why the group of us that
 
00:30:04.549 --> 00:30:04.559 align:start position:0%
conferred did it this way because what I
 
00:30:07.430 --> 00:30:07.440 align:start position:0%
did not want is to get into a similar
 
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
situation that we're in right now with
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
mandatory overtime where we're literally
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
forcing people to work
 
00:30:17.450 --> 00:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
you know scenario that is really close
 
00:30:20.149 --> 00:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
to slave labor by threatening people's
 
00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
jobs and and whatnot by forcing them to
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
come in on this mandatory I didn't want
 
00:30:26.029 --> 00:30:26.039 align:start position:0%
to exacerbate that by saying we're going
 
00:30:28.430 --> 00:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
to force you to do a year right we're
 
00:30:30.409 --> 00:30:30.419 align:start position:0%
going to ask you this is what you get in
 
00:30:30.419 --> 00:30:31.730 align:start position:0%
going to ask you this is what you get in
return

00:30:31.730 --> 00:30:31.740 align:start position:0%
return
 
00:30:32.870 --> 00:30:32.880 align:start position:0%
I just I just want to make sure
 
00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
everybody in the committee understands
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
we're not offering to allow people to
 
00:30:37.549 --> 00:30:37.559 align:start position:0%
leave sooner correct they're able to
 
00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
leave when they were already able to
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
leave but we're just trying to
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
incentivize that discount around a
 
00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:51.659 align:start position:0%
um so that language follows through
 
00:30:54.409 --> 00:30:54.419 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of page four correct yep
 
00:30:57.350 --> 00:30:57.360 align:start position:0%
it's a so a paragraphs A and B repeated
 
00:30:59.269 --> 00:30:59.279 align:start position:0%
c and d right the separation of group
 
00:31:01.850 --> 00:31:01.860 align:start position:0%
one and group two uh at a request lines
 
00:31:04.070 --> 00:31:04.080 align:start position:0%
12 and 28 contain the word teacher they
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in there that that will
 
00:31:07.970 --> 00:31:07.980 align:start position:0%
come out
 
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
because there's no need of that
 
00:31:13.490 --> 00:31:13.500 align:start position:0%
yeah there's there's a yeah on line 12
 
00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:18.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:20.269 --> 00:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
so any questions from any member of the
 
00:31:22.789 --> 00:31:22.799 align:start position:0%
committee so far on that concept because
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
now we're going to go into
 
00:31:24.539 --> 00:31:26.149 align:start position:0%
now we're going to go into
um

00:31:26.149 --> 00:31:26.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:28.789 --> 00:31:28.799 align:start position:0%
final compensation average yes
 
00:31:28.799 --> 00:31:30.230 align:start position:0%
final compensation average yes
representative

00:31:30.230 --> 00:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:32.760 align:start position:0%
so with uh with what we were just
 
00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:33.769 align:start position:0%
so with uh with what we were just
discussing

00:31:33.769 --> 00:31:33.779 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
00:31:36.710 --> 00:31:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh trying to encourage people to work a
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
little longer
 
00:31:40.370 --> 00:31:40.380 align:start position:0%
can somebody give me what does a little
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
longer mean
 
00:31:45.590 --> 00:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
so uh to you I mean I could probably use
 
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
the the what you what it uses an example
 
00:31:51.649 --> 00:31:51.659 align:start position:0%
here so do we want to wait until we just
 
00:31:52.789 --> 00:31:52.799 align:start position:0%
get to the chart to answer that question
 
00:31:54.590 --> 00:31:54.600 align:start position:0%
would that be easier I'm
 
00:31:56.930 --> 00:31:56.940 align:start position:0%
his mind it's fine so what happens what
 
00:32:00.049 --> 00:32:00.059 align:start position:0%
happens is is that if if I if I earned a
 
00:32:04.549 --> 00:32:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.769 --> 00:32:06.779 align:start position:0%
for that year I take fifty thousand
 
00:32:08.690 --> 00:32:08.700 align:start position:0%
dollars out of the system but if I work
 
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
not only am I not taking fifty thousand
 
00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:13.740 align:start position:0%
out I have to contribute based on my
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
salary so I'm instead of removing 50 000
 
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:19.260 align:start position:0%
out of the system I'm putting 12 000 in
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
it's a full it's a full Switcheroo if
 
00:32:23.510 --> 00:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
you will
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
um if you were a fan of the National
 
00:32:28.789 --> 00:32:28.799 align:start position:0%
League double double Switcheroo but the
 
00:32:32.450 --> 00:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
so that has a financial
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
it's a substantial Financial difference
 
00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:36.110 align:start position:0%
it's a substantial Financial difference
because

00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
I'm not drawing out but I'm actually
 
00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.549 align:start position:0%
I'm not drawing out but I'm actually
contributing

00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
contributing
 
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:43.080 align:start position:0%
you can't lock I can't give you a rock
 
00:32:44.930 --> 00:32:44.940 align:start position:0%
hard example other than the hypothetical
 
00:32:47.149 --> 00:32:47.159 align:start position:0%
50 000 because every single person
 
00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's in the pension system
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
has a different salary has different
 
00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:53.120 align:start position:0%
years of service
 
00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:56.520 align:start position:0%
what might be simpler is that if you
 
00:32:59.149 --> 00:32:59.159 align:start position:0%
retire right now
 
00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:03.000 align:start position:0%
you will get 2.1 percent of your average
 
00:33:05.590 --> 00:33:05.600 align:start position:0%
final compensation 2.4
 
00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:08.159 align:start position:0%
2.4 2.4
 
00:33:10.789 --> 00:33:10.799 align:start position:0%
if you re if you wait a year until this
 
00:33:12.889 --> 00:33:12.899 align:start position:0%
goes into effect you will receive 2.5
 
00:33:16.370 --> 00:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
times your average final salary times
 
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:19.320 align:start position:0%
your years of service so you'll have not
 
00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
only one more year of service you will
 
00:33:27.070 --> 00:33:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
per year per year well so you'll you
 
00:33:32.389 --> 00:33:32.399 align:start position:0%
will get a bonus in your pension which
 
00:33:32.399 --> 00:33:33.830 align:start position:0%
will get a bonus in your pension which
is

00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:33:35.570 --> 00:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know like four percent a four
 
00:33:37.909 --> 00:33:37.919 align:start position:0%
percent increase in your pension plus an
 
00:33:40.909 --> 00:33:40.919 align:start position:0%
extra year service so so one year Chris
 
00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
I think is what you were asking you
 
00:33:44.090 --> 00:33:44.100 align:start position:0%
we're incentivizing them to stay an
 
00:33:46.850 --> 00:33:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
yes correct now as far as incentivizing
 
00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
it's it's a little bit more than it's a
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
minimum of a year that they would have
 
00:33:55.250 --> 00:33:55.260 align:start position:0%
to do beyond that the incentive still
 
00:33:57.230 --> 00:33:57.240 align:start position:0%
continues right for them to continue
 
00:33:59.330 --> 00:33:59.340 align:start position:0%
working so I don't want to I don't want
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
this framed into like just a one-year
 
00:34:03.710 --> 00:34:03.720 align:start position:0%
framework it's it goes beyond that but
 
00:34:06.409 --> 00:34:06.419 align:start position:0%
it's it requires a minimum of one year
 
00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
right to achieve it to achieve it
 
00:34:08.520 --> 00:34:11.329 align:start position:0%
right to achieve it to achieve it
correct

00:34:11.329 --> 00:34:11.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:13.010 --> 00:34:13.020 align:start position:0%
and maybe people will feel a little less
 
00:34:14.149 --> 00:34:14.159 align:start position:0%
burnt out if they're getting paid better
 
00:34:16.849 --> 00:34:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
people's internal internal value of what
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
they contribute to their employer
 
00:34:25.129 --> 00:34:25.139 align:start position:0%
matters I mean there's been plethora of
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
studies involving raises the concept of
 
00:34:31.070 --> 00:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
raises the concept of value employee
 
00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
production based on how they feel
 
00:34:35.570 --> 00:34:35.580 align:start position:0%
they're valued in an organization
 
00:34:37.010 --> 00:34:37.020 align:start position:0%
and I can tell you at least in that
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
category right now in my 20 plus years
 
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:41.280 align:start position:0%
of being in the in the services in New
 
00:34:42.530 --> 00:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I don't think it's ever been
 
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
lower it is it is just almost rock
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
bottom right now and this would go a
 
00:34:51.470 --> 00:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
tremendously long way in improving that
 
00:34:53.750 --> 00:34:53.760 align:start position:0%
without any further objection I'll move
 
00:34:55.609 --> 00:34:55.619 align:start position:0%
we'll move on to uh average final
 
00:34:57.770 --> 00:34:57.780 align:start position:0%
compensation really on page five is
 
00:35:00.050 --> 00:35:00.060 align:start position:0%
where where our stuff comes in
 
00:35:01.790 --> 00:35:01.800 align:start position:0%
so at a request of the retirement system
 
00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:04.680 align:start position:0%
pretty much the second half of paragraph
 
00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
a which is lines one through five
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
they want gone because it doesn't it
 
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't apply to group one
 
00:35:15.050 --> 00:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
so that's a request of of uh the
 
00:35:16.670 --> 00:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
retirement system that makes sense it's
 
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
just it's inappropriate language for
 
00:35:20.750 --> 00:35:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:23.880 align:start position:0%
group one with only the one sentence
 
00:35:25.730 --> 00:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
on pay at the bottom of page four
 
00:35:28.670 --> 00:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
correct and that matches frankly the
 
00:35:31.490 --> 00:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
original sentence that existed from 1967
 
00:35:34.609 --> 00:35:34.619 align:start position:0%
to 2010. which was which was literally
 
00:35:36.849 --> 00:35:36.859 align:start position:0%
one sentence
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
that language does matter so that's why
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
it is in bold line six through fourteen
 
00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:49.020 align:start position:0%
it is a repeat of what what was in
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
status literally in status it's word for
 
00:35:52.310 --> 00:35:52.320 align:start position:0%
word with the only difference being
 
00:35:55.130 --> 00:35:55.140 align:start position:0%
divested the one year as we begin down
 
00:35:56.990 --> 00:35:57.000 align:start position:0%
that road otherwise it's verbatim as to
 
00:36:02.349 --> 00:36:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:05.750 --> 00:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
this is part of a compromise because
 
00:36:09.530 --> 00:36:09.540 align:start position:0%
it's leaving in a change
 
00:36:11.690 --> 00:36:11.700 align:start position:0%
that did not occur when these people
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
hire were hired and that involves an
 
00:36:17.870 --> 00:36:17.880 align:start position:0%
anti-spiking provision
 
00:36:21.050 --> 00:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
so the anti-spiking provision remains
 
00:36:21.060 --> 00:36:22.310 align:start position:0%
so the anti-spiking provision remains
um

00:36:22.310 --> 00:36:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
we all are well or at least
 
00:36:29.450 --> 00:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire is well aware it
 
00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
that the anti-spiking provisions were
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
for the most part put into place because
 
00:36:36.050 --> 00:36:36.060 align:start position:0%
they were needed and
 
00:36:38.450 --> 00:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
I what we don't want to do is upset that
 
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
so the so those even though
 
00:36:42.890 --> 00:36:42.900 align:start position:0%
realistically they should be taken out
 
00:36:45.050 --> 00:36:45.060 align:start position:0%
for folks because they were not enacted
 
00:36:48.290 --> 00:36:48.300 align:start position:0%
until 2009 that is a compromise to
 
00:36:51.650 --> 00:36:51.660 align:start position:0%
prevent a repeat of problems yeah I'd
 
00:36:54.069 --> 00:36:54.079 align:start position:0%
like to mention that when we looked into
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
spiking at various occasions
 
00:36:59.930 --> 00:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
over the last 15 years at least we found
 
00:37:02.329 --> 00:37:02.339 align:start position:0%
that most
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
people worked who worked a lot of
 
00:37:07.430 --> 00:37:07.440 align:start position:0%
overtime in their last few years also
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
worked a lot of overtime in their
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
earlier years so this would not affect
 
00:37:15.470 --> 00:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
anybody who consistently worked overtime
 
00:37:17.990 --> 00:37:18.000 align:start position:0%
it would only affect people who said Gee
 
00:37:20.810 --> 00:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
I can jack up my pension by working a
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
lot in the last year or two I mean one
 
00:37:26.750 --> 00:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
of my personal friends was a fireman in
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
San Francisco and in his last year of
 
00:37:32.450 --> 00:37:32.460 align:start position:0%
service he told us well we I won't be
 
00:37:34.069 --> 00:37:34.079 align:start position:0%
seeing you for the next year because I'm
 
00:37:36.530 --> 00:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
going to be working all the overtime and
 
00:37:39.230 --> 00:37:39.240 align:start position:0%
extra shifts that I can pull because it
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
was going to spike his pension and it
 
00:37:43.370 --> 00:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
did in fact give him a substantial
 
00:37:45.710 --> 00:37:45.720 align:start position:0%
benefit because that pension system
 
00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
allowed it
 
00:37:49.910 --> 00:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
so he got I think an extra extra 10 10
 
00:37:52.250 --> 00:37:52.260 align:start position:0%
15 000 a year by
 
00:37:54.950 --> 00:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
basically working full-time
 
00:37:58.370 --> 00:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
20 24 7 his last year of service
 
00:38:00.650 --> 00:38:00.660 align:start position:0%
so and we don't want that to happen it's
 
00:38:03.410 --> 00:38:03.420 align:start position:0%
unfair to the people and it's
 
00:38:05.329 --> 00:38:05.339 align:start position:0%
but it's unfair to both the people who
 
00:38:07.130 --> 00:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
pay for the pension and the and the
 
00:38:09.650 --> 00:38:09.660 align:start position:0%
people that are trying to manipulate it
 
00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.290 align:start position:0%
people that are trying to manipulate it
representative

00:38:12.290 --> 00:38:12.300 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:14.329 align:start position:0%
representative
um

00:38:14.329 --> 00:38:14.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
I I said it before on committee and it's
 
00:38:19.250 --> 00:38:19.260 align:start position:0%
not unjust
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
um speak to me as if I were a child
 
00:38:23.210 --> 00:38:23.220 align:start position:0%
speak to me as if I were a golden
 
00:38:26.089 --> 00:38:26.099 align:start position:0%
retriever or a pet turtle I have no idea
 
00:38:28.250 --> 00:38:28.260 align:start position:0%
what spiking is so I can give you a
 
00:38:32.930 --> 00:38:32.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:36.069 --> 00:38:36.079 align:start position:0%
you work 17 years
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
in your job
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
and you look at the way that the system
 
00:38:42.410 --> 00:38:42.420 align:start position:0%
used to function and say hey you know
 
00:38:45.010 --> 00:38:45.020 align:start position:0%
what for the next three years if I just
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
do a hundred hours a week I will inflate
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
my pension to to a number that really
 
00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't really jive with the prior 17
 
00:38:59.690 --> 00:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
years I worked and that in their that's
 
00:39:01.910 --> 00:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
what they a lot of people did they and
 
00:39:05.329 --> 00:39:05.339 align:start position:0%
the divorce rate was was horrible that I
 
00:39:07.609 --> 00:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
mean this this led to burned out people
 
00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
it led to to folks that were just became
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
kind of horrible workers because they
 
00:39:13.810 --> 00:39:13.820 align:start position:0%
were you know in in the interest of of
 
00:39:15.950 --> 00:39:15.960 align:start position:0%
greed I guess you would call it or the
 
00:39:17.930 --> 00:39:17.940 align:start position:0%
interests of gaming the system they just
 
00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
never went home all they did was work
 
00:39:23.690 --> 00:39:23.700 align:start position:0%
and what happens with that is that yes
 
00:39:26.089 --> 00:39:26.099 align:start position:0%
they contribute into the system for that
 
00:39:30.530 --> 00:39:30.540 align:start position:0%
time period based on an elevated salary
 
00:39:32.329 --> 00:39:32.339 align:start position:0%
but the way that the pension sensor
 
00:39:35.329 --> 00:39:35.339 align:start position:0%
functions it it's not the Investments
 
00:39:37.790 --> 00:39:37.800 align:start position:0%
over time the way the system works it
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
can't handle that so it's detrimental to
 
00:39:43.790 --> 00:39:43.800 align:start position:0%
the Corpus of the fund as a whole
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
so when they looked at this back a
 
00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
decade 14 years ago
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
in conjunction with the retirement
 
00:39:53.569 --> 00:39:53.579 align:start position:0%
system that you they said okay this is
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
this is dangerous to the health of the
 
00:39:58.310 --> 00:39:58.320 align:start position:0%
system and we need to put some things in
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
place to prevent this from occurring
 
00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:03.890 align:start position:0%
place to prevent this from occurring
further

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:06.660 align:start position:0%
that's recognized
 
00:40:08.750 --> 00:40:08.760 align:start position:0%
one of the things that for those that
 
00:40:10.310 --> 00:40:10.320 align:start position:0%
care about this system we certainly
 
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
don't want to see the system fall apart
 
00:40:14.750 --> 00:40:14.760 align:start position:0%
we don't want to see this system default
 
00:40:17.210 --> 00:40:17.220 align:start position:0%
and the anti-spiking provisions that
 
00:40:20.329 --> 00:40:20.339 align:start position:0%
were put in place frankly work the
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
health of the the system has gotten
 
00:40:23.690 --> 00:40:23.700 align:start position:0%
substantially healthier just in the last
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
four years we've we've increased our
 
00:40:28.190 --> 00:40:28.200 align:start position:0%
assets by several billion
 
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
so there's no desire to to make a change
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
to go back to something we know is
 
00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:35.390 align:start position:0%
to go back to something we know is
hurtful

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:35.400 align:start position:0%
hurtful
 
00:40:39.290 --> 00:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
yeah it also we also the other issue
 
00:40:41.630 --> 00:40:41.640 align:start position:0%
with spot with that kind of spiking is
 
00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:43.800 align:start position:0%
you end up with people retiring with
 
00:40:46.490 --> 00:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
outrageous out looking salaries and they
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
make the newspaper and a lot of people
 
00:40:52.130 --> 00:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
assume that all retirees are collecting
 
00:40:55.910 --> 00:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
150 000 a year when it's only those who
 
00:40:58.849 --> 00:40:58.859 align:start position:0%
manipulated the system to get more extra
 
00:41:00.890 --> 00:41:00.900 align:start position:0%
two things Mr chair
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
um so anti-spiking is somewhere on the
 
00:41:05.950 --> 00:41:05.960 align:start position:0%
bottom of four and top of five
 
00:41:07.970 --> 00:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
anti-spiking is throughout the document
 
00:41:09.470 --> 00:41:09.480 align:start position:0%
there's several other things that occur
 
00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:11.040 align:start position:0%
too this just happens to be one of those
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
Provisions yeah he was just saying that
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
the language is still in there don't
 
00:41:18.470 --> 00:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
exist but but what keeps the system from
 
00:41:20.990 --> 00:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
allowing them to do that is in the
 
00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:22.250 align:start position:0%
allowing them to do that is in the
document

00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
and and uh in testimony he said well and
 
00:41:28.250 --> 00:41:28.260 align:start position:0%
what just we're going to take our
 
00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.750 align:start position:0%
what just we're going to take our
teachers

00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
00:41:32.030 --> 00:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
I haven't been taken out teacher are we
 
00:41:33.950 --> 00:41:33.960 align:start position:0%
looking at another amendment that's
 
00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:35.900 align:start position:0%
going to take out a lot yes
 
00:41:38.870 --> 00:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
it won't change any of the language that
 
00:41:41.829 --> 00:41:41.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
removing teachers from some of the group
 
00:41:46.970 --> 00:41:46.980 align:start position:0%
two language and removing and vice versa
 
00:41:48.829 --> 00:41:48.839 align:start position:0%
it went both ways yeah
 
00:41:51.829 --> 00:41:51.839 align:start position:0%
and as as Retirement stated that that
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't change the concept of substance
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
the cost it's a language cleanup that's
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
and that's all it is it really probably
 
00:42:01.010 --> 00:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have any practical if it was
 
00:42:03.250 --> 00:42:03.260 align:start position:0%
left in there it would
 
00:42:06.890 --> 00:42:06.900 align:start position:0%
just be messy yeah that's all and that
 
00:42:08.870 --> 00:42:08.880 align:start position:0%
and that bothers Marty so we don't want
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
to do that there are no group two
 
00:42:15.170 --> 00:42:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:16.849 --> 00:42:16.859 align:start position:0%
that's all that is although the teachers
 
00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:18.540 align:start position:0%
might come up with an extra Duty
 
00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:19.970 align:start position:0%
might come up with an extra Duty
something

00:42:19.970 --> 00:42:19.980 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:42:23.450 --> 00:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
or something else yes is your particular
 
00:42:29.810 --> 00:42:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:32.930 --> 00:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
so the the paragraph C is just a
 
00:42:35.210 --> 00:42:35.220 align:start position:0%
renaming of a paragraph
 
00:42:36.530 --> 00:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
because we you know can't have two
 
00:42:38.630 --> 00:42:38.640 align:start position:0%
paragraph B's
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
um the paragraph d
 
00:42:43.970 --> 00:42:43.980 align:start position:0%
it goes along with the consistency of
 
00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
moving that date forward a year at a
 
00:42:46.619 --> 00:42:47.690 align:start position:0%
moving that date forward a year at a
time

00:42:47.690 --> 00:42:47.700 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
uh in paragraph two
 
00:42:53.150 --> 00:42:53.160 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I I removed here
 
00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:55.680 align:start position:0%
or we removed here I keep saying I
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
shouldn't is
 
00:42:57.359 --> 00:42:58.309 align:start position:0%
shouldn't is
um

00:42:58.309 --> 00:42:58.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:59.809 --> 00:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
I've never been comfortable with that
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
line that's crossed out because if you
 
00:43:04.670 --> 00:43:04.680 align:start position:0%
started on July 1 of 11 January 1 of 12
 
00:43:07.790 --> 00:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
is six months later there is
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
it's almost impossible for that to
 
00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.300 align:start position:0%
scenario to exist I don't like it I
 
00:43:14.390 --> 00:43:14.400 align:start position:0%
think it's confusing in the interest of
 
00:43:17.089 --> 00:43:17.099 align:start position:0%
having a firm Line in the Sand
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
page six is so A5 paragraph A5 in the
 
00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
statute which is predominantly what page
 
00:43:35.030 --> 00:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
six is about has to do with
 
00:43:37.430 --> 00:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
qualifications of you know when you're
 
00:43:39.829 --> 00:43:39.839 align:start position:0%
allowed to earn your pension
 
00:43:43.930 --> 00:43:43.940 align:start position:0%
so all there's no policy no
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
language changes at all it's just a date
 
00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:48.050 align:start position:0%
language changes at all it's just a date
change

00:43:48.050 --> 00:43:48.060 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:43:50.210 --> 00:43:50.220 align:start position:0%
to start the process of transitioning
 
00:43:51.410 --> 00:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
people back
 
00:43:53.390 --> 00:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
no other language has changed in A5
 
00:43:53.400 --> 00:43:54.829 align:start position:0%
no other language has changed in A5
whatsoever

00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
00:43:57.470 --> 00:43:57.480 align:start position:0%
until we get to
 
00:44:00.410 --> 00:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
Part D which is on page seven
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
this Infamous chart that everybody
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
has nightmares about both from an
 
00:44:08.089 --> 00:44:08.099 align:start position:0%
employer employee and retirement system
 
00:44:08.099 --> 00:44:10.910 align:start position:0%
employer employee and retirement system
standpoint

00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
standpoint
 
00:44:12.290 --> 00:44:12.300 align:start position:0%
so the chart
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
what what we the change in the chart is
 
00:44:17.510 --> 00:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
simply to take the chart apart
 
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
that's it it doesn't change anything in
 
00:44:21.790 --> 00:44:21.800 align:start position:0%
the chart but it takes it from
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
four categories to ten because if you're
 
00:44:26.510 --> 00:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
going to annually move someone
 
00:44:28.970 --> 00:44:28.980 align:start position:0%
if you don't do that then you're moving
 
00:44:32.109 --> 00:44:32.119 align:start position:0%
two years of people
 
00:44:32.119 --> 00:44:33.670 align:start position:0%
two years of people
disproportionately

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
disproportionately
 
00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:37.260 align:start position:0%
the the FI you know the line 20 Which is
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
less than four years would be the
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
movement of four people simultaneously
 
00:44:43.010 --> 00:44:43.020 align:start position:0%
and therefore one group would only have
 
00:44:44.450 --> 00:44:44.460 align:start position:0%
to work
 
00:44:45.890 --> 00:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
X number of years and the rest of them
 
00:44:47.690 --> 00:44:47.700 align:start position:0%
would have to work more so this is just
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
an equity thing if you're going to move
 
00:44:50.329 --> 00:44:50.339 align:start position:0%
people annually you have to take the
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
chart apart to to do that so this this
 
00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:54.410 align:start position:0%
chart apart to to do that so this this
separates

00:44:54.410 --> 00:44:54.420 align:start position:0%
separates
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
the transition
 
00:45:00.410 --> 00:45:00.420 align:start position:0%
from two to two one-year groups correct
 
00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:03.000 align:start position:0%
that's all it does yep the rest of the
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
math is the first group from four years
 
00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:07.020 align:start position:0%
done to individual well yeah it was
 
00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:08.220 align:start position:0%
originally four years this is taken
 
00:45:10.970 --> 00:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
apart yeah it goes it just makes it one
 
00:45:17.050 --> 00:45:17.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.370 --> 00:45:19.380 align:start position:0%
uh let's see yeah and you have to I mean
 
00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:20.579 align:start position:0%
you really have to do that once you
 
00:45:22.790 --> 00:45:22.800 align:start position:0%
start pulling it pulling them out one
 
00:45:23.930 --> 00:45:23.940 align:start position:0%
year at a time because we're gonna go
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
one year at a time so you go exactly you
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
got to be impossible there's no other
 
00:45:28.490 --> 00:45:28.500 align:start position:0%
way to do it that would be and again
 
00:45:29.809 --> 00:45:29.819 align:start position:0%
we're supposed to be writing law here
 
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
where people regular folks can read this
 
00:45:34.370 --> 00:45:34.380 align:start position:0%
and kind of get an understanding so if
 
00:45:35.930 --> 00:45:35.940 align:start position:0%
it was written into some bizarre
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
legalese goo
 
00:45:41.150 --> 00:45:41.160 align:start position:0%
Marty would be getting to phone calls
 
00:45:43.609 --> 00:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
all the time trying how it's bad enough
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
they're asking for interpretations as it
 
00:45:47.450 --> 00:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
is I don't want to make that worse so
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
this just simplifies that for folks that
 
00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:51.780 align:start position:0%
go on to the Internet and try to figure
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
this master they're still going to call
 
00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
but that's okay massive document out
 
00:45:58.370 --> 00:45:58.380 align:start position:0%
sure so where we where we get into a
 
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
little bit more substantive changes here
 
00:46:05.089 --> 00:46:05.099 align:start position:0%
is now in 186 which is the pension cap
 
00:46:07.550 --> 00:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
the pension cap was instituted in 2009
 
00:46:09.349 --> 00:46:09.359 align:start position:0%
prior to that there was no cap of any
 
00:46:09.359 --> 00:46:11.150 align:start position:0%
prior to that there was no cap of any
type

00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
type
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
where are you page eight
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
twenty six line 26. starting on line 13.
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
which is section a 100 RSA 186.
 
00:46:25.970 --> 00:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
so the first part mirrors the problem
 
00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:28.260 align:start position:0%
that I had with the prior paragraph in
 
00:46:28.260 --> 00:46:29.809 align:start position:0%
that I had with the prior paragraph in
that

00:46:29.809 --> 00:46:29.819 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:46:29.819 --> 00:46:30.770 align:start position:0%
that
um

00:46:30.770 --> 00:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:32.450 --> 00:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
if we're going to have a definitive Line
 
00:46:33.710 --> 00:46:33.720 align:start position:0%
in the Sand
 
00:46:36.829 --> 00:46:36.839 align:start position:0%
then it needs to just read that way
 
00:46:39.950 --> 00:46:39.960 align:start position:0%
when you get to
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
the second part
 
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:53.510 --> 00:46:53.520 align:start position:0%
adhering to the idea of penalties or
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
calculations that didn't exist when
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
these folks started the the lesser of 85
 
00:46:59.930 --> 00:46:59.940 align:start position:0%
percent of a member's average final
 
00:47:02.510 --> 00:47:02.520 align:start position:0%
compensation are 120 000 did not exist
 
00:47:04.849 --> 00:47:04.859 align:start position:0%
until 2009.
 
00:47:07.010 --> 00:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
so this just basically in the interest
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
of keeping
 
00:47:12.170 --> 00:47:12.180 align:start position:0%
a definitive line of July 1 of 11.
 
00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
puts that little line right there the
 
00:47:16.910 --> 00:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
folks that were hired before July 1 of
 
00:47:20.089 --> 00:47:20.099 align:start position:0%
01 that never had a cap of any type will
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
continue under that Realm
 
00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
so it basically puts a pension cap into
 
00:47:25.910 --> 00:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
three categories
 
00:47:36.770 --> 00:47:36.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:38.450 --> 00:47:38.460 align:start position:0%
so the people we were dealing with the
 
00:47:40.550 --> 00:47:40.560 align:start position:0%
transitional 10-year they're getting a 5
 
00:47:40.560 --> 00:47:41.170 align:start position:0%
transitional 10-year they're getting a 5
000

00:47:41.170 --> 00:47:41.180 align:start position:0%
000
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
bump in their cap in in 120 000 in 2009
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
equals 166 385 dollars today if you look
 
00:47:53.329 --> 00:47:53.339 align:start position:0%
at the 38.6 percent inflation for this
 
00:47:56.210 --> 00:47:56.220 align:start position:0%
District over that time
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
so the 125 is really just because I like
 
00:48:01.010 --> 00:48:01.020 align:start position:0%
round numbers and it seems like a round
 
00:48:02.589 --> 00:48:02.599 align:start position:0%
number so
 
00:48:04.970 --> 00:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
by right if you wanted to make things
 
00:48:08.030 --> 00:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
whole it would be 166 166 000 pension to
 
00:48:10.670 --> 00:48:10.680 align:start position:0%
me is outrageous so I'm not going to
 
00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:12.420 align:start position:0%
make the argument that
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
but I want you to understand though that
 
00:48:17.270 --> 00:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
that with the rest of this is Essence is
 
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:19.140 align:start position:0%
somewhat of a compromise because it's
 
00:48:22.670 --> 00:48:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:26.630 --> 00:48:26.640 align:start position:0%
yeah I I understand the 125
 
00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:28.309 align:start position:0%
yeah I I understand the 125
000.

00:48:28.309 --> 00:48:28.319 align:start position:0%
000.
 
00:48:28.319 --> 00:48:29.990 align:start position:0%
000.
um

00:48:29.990 --> 00:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:32.700 align:start position:0%
the less but you're deleting the lesser
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
of 85 percent of the members average
 
00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:38.300 align:start position:0%
final compensation only for folks in the
 
00:48:41.329 --> 00:48:41.339 align:start position:0%
2011 group The the new hires that is a
 
00:48:43.010 --> 00:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
condition that existed when they were
 
00:48:45.650 --> 00:48:45.660 align:start position:0%
hired and that remains in paragraph C
 
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
which is the the 2011 and on folks so
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
that someone
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
in the transition could work long enough
 
00:48:56.630 --> 00:48:56.640 align:start position:0%
to get a hundred percent of their
 
00:48:58.730 --> 00:48:58.740 align:start position:0%
average final compensation well that is
 
00:49:01.370 --> 00:49:01.380 align:start position:0%
the the and that is the maximum cap
 
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
um you cannot go beyond 100 of that it
 
00:49:09.290 --> 00:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:13.010 --> 00:49:13.020 align:start position:0%
it says they can't exceed 125.
 
00:49:14.630 --> 00:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
in this and there's yeah there's a and
 
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:17.040 align:start position:0%
there's a hard number at 125 000. I get
 
00:49:19.609 --> 00:49:19.619 align:start position:0%
that but I think that it if you're going
 
00:49:22.430 --> 00:49:22.440 align:start position:0%
to be essentially changing that 85 to
 
00:49:24.950 --> 00:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
100 I think you should leave it there
 
00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.730 align:start position:0%
100 I think you should leave it there
because

00:49:28.730 --> 00:49:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:35.390 --> 00:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
that's true there's no reason why if I
 
00:49:36.410 --> 00:49:36.420 align:start position:0%
think according to that language if
 
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
their benefit was going to be 85 that
 
00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
they couldn't just give them 125 if they
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
wanted to it's not capped at 100 percent
 
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not entirely sure what you're asking
 
00:49:48.890 --> 00:49:48.900 align:start position:0%
here so my point is that 85 of final
 
00:49:52.670 --> 00:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
compensation yeah is a limit of one sort
 
00:49:54.710 --> 00:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
and then there's a hard dollar correct
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
except all right if you want to say that
 
00:50:00.290 --> 00:50:00.300 align:start position:0%
someone who has been a long Service
 
00:50:04.190 --> 00:50:04.200 align:start position:0%
employee can continue to earn up to a
 
00:50:06.650 --> 00:50:06.660 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of their final salary
 
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
gotcha then say so okay so change the 85
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
to 100. I think yeah that would be more
 
00:50:12.359 --> 00:50:16.870 align:start position:0%
to 100. I think yeah that would be more
okay

00:50:16.870 --> 00:50:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.609 --> 00:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
by all means yeah
 
00:50:21.890 --> 00:50:21.900 align:start position:0%
and just just to clarify
 
00:50:23.990 --> 00:50:24.000 align:start position:0%
um under the two and a half percent
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
multiplier for group uh group two the
 
00:50:30.290 --> 00:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
original tra folks excuse me once
 
00:50:32.690 --> 00:50:32.700 align:start position:0%
somebody works 40 years at two and a
 
00:50:34.010 --> 00:50:34.020 align:start position:0%
half percent a year they've accrued a
 
00:50:35.270 --> 00:50:35.280 align:start position:0%
hundred percent of their average final
 
00:50:37.010 --> 00:50:37.020 align:start position:0%
compensation we've had some Chiefs
 
00:50:39.470 --> 00:50:39.480 align:start position:0%
who've worked beyond that
 
00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
um you know and um you know but so and
 
00:50:46.670 --> 00:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
so if if it was 85 that would be 34 at
 
00:50:48.829 --> 00:50:48.839 align:start position:0%
two and a half percent that's 34 years
 
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
so that that's how that that's how
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
someone could get to a hundred percent
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
of AFC is by working you know extremely
 
00:50:58.849 --> 00:50:58.859 align:start position:0%
long and I certainly don't want to say
 
00:51:03.250 --> 00:51:03.260 align:start position:0%
say Hey you worked 34 years bye-bye that
 
00:51:05.870 --> 00:51:05.880 align:start position:0%
again encouraging people to work longer
 
00:51:07.910 --> 00:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
is better for the system shutting them
 
00:51:11.750 --> 00:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
off at 34 years and I think there are
 
00:51:14.270 --> 00:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
other Provisions that say that after
 
00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
you've worked 40 years you you stop
 
00:51:17.819 --> 00:51:19.210 align:start position:0%
you've worked 40 years you you stop
contributing

00:51:19.210 --> 00:51:19.220 align:start position:0%
contributing
 
00:51:21.770 --> 00:51:21.780 align:start position:0%
no actually I was just going to say that
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
the member doesn't contribute after
 
00:51:25.130 --> 00:51:25.140 align:start position:0%
they've maxed out we still think the
 
00:51:30.250 --> 00:51:30.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
is that just because that exists would
 
00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:33.900 align:start position:0%
you stop doing that
 
00:51:33.900 --> 00:51:36.349 align:start position:0%
you stop doing that
otherwise

00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
well there's nothing in the stature that
 
00:51:41.870 --> 00:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
would allow us to not collect employer
 
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
contributions on the salary of active
 
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
members so regardless of whether it's
 
00:51:47.210 --> 00:51:47.220 align:start position:0%
they have one year of service or 50.
 
00:51:49.609 --> 00:51:49.619 align:start position:0%
okay that makes sense and and putting it
 
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
leaving in the percent of final
 
00:51:54.530 --> 00:51:54.540 align:start position:0%
compensation but setting it at 100 would
 
00:51:56.470 --> 00:51:56.480 align:start position:0%
mean that
 
00:51:59.210 --> 00:51:59.220 align:start position:0%
members with 40 years of service will
 
00:52:01.609 --> 00:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
continue to be eligible to not
 
00:52:03.049 --> 00:52:03.059 align:start position:0%
contribute anymore
 
00:52:05.030 --> 00:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise if it's just a flat dollar
 
00:52:07.849 --> 00:52:07.859 align:start position:0%
amount there's no reason to do so
 
00:52:09.710 --> 00:52:09.720 align:start position:0%
sure that makes sense okay I get you
 
00:52:12.049 --> 00:52:12.059 align:start position:0%
there so the other thing that's here is
 
00:52:15.170 --> 00:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
that in in uh retirement provided this
 
00:52:17.569 --> 00:52:17.579 align:start position:0%
chart in their explanation page as to
 
00:52:19.970 --> 00:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
what a one and a quarter percent annual
 
00:52:22.250 --> 00:52:22.260 align:start position:0%
increase in the cap looks like
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh just so that you could understand
 
00:52:27.049 --> 00:52:27.059 align:start position:0%
the the hard math without having to do
 
00:52:27.950 --> 00:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
it yourself
 
00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:29.450 align:start position:0%
it yourself
um

00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:32.030 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:52:32.030 --> 00:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:52:34.430 --> 00:52:34.440 align:start position:0%
what we have seen and especially in
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
reference to a hundred and twenty
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars equaling 166 today is
 
00:52:40.130 --> 00:52:40.140 align:start position:0%
that if we don't have some kind of
 
00:52:42.829 --> 00:52:42.839 align:start position:0%
mechanism to adjust that number
 
00:52:46.250 --> 00:52:46.260 align:start position:0%
those dollars become old
 
00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:49.740 align:start position:0%
and this is no at one and a quarter
 
00:52:52.870 --> 00:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
percent we are nowhere near inflation
 
00:52:58.549 --> 00:52:58.559 align:start position:0%
nowhere near it but at least at at least
 
00:53:00.890 --> 00:53:00.900 align:start position:0%
this provides a mechanism for it to move
 
00:53:04.730 --> 00:53:04.740 align:start position:0%
forward it doesn't it also prevents the
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
pension cap from also being a ceiling
 
00:53:09.049 --> 00:53:09.059 align:start position:0%
eventually where if you get to that
 
00:53:11.750 --> 00:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
point go hey I'm at my 125 you know 15
 
00:53:14.510 --> 00:53:14.520 align:start position:0%
18 years from now see ya I gotta go I'm
 
00:53:16.790 --> 00:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
not you know I'm not working for free so
 
00:53:18.970 --> 00:53:18.980 align:start position:0%
it prevents that from happening as well
 
00:53:21.170 --> 00:53:21.180 align:start position:0%
but just keep in mind that they ran
 
00:53:22.970 --> 00:53:22.980 align:start position:0%
these numbers out to 2036 and you're
 
00:53:25.609 --> 00:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
still not at 166 000 you're still not
 
00:53:29.390 --> 00:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
even at today's dollars so this is just
 
00:53:31.970 --> 00:53:31.980 align:start position:0%
any further inflation adjustment would
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
take place in the compensation line
 
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
sure you know or or if this really fell
 
00:53:39.890 --> 00:53:39.900 align:start position:0%
behind drastically in the future the
 
00:53:41.329 --> 00:53:41.339 align:start position:0%
legislature certainly has the right to
 
00:53:43.309 --> 00:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
come in and adjust it that's they would
 
00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
not be restricted from doing that at all
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
so but it's just a mechanism to not to
 
00:53:50.630 --> 00:53:50.640 align:start position:0%
prevent a stagnant dollar
 
00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:52.559 align:start position:0%
is all that it is
 
00:53:56.630 --> 00:53:56.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:56.640 --> 00:53:59.210 align:start position:0%
 
Chris

00:53:59.210 --> 00:53:59.220 align:start position:0%
Chris
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
I feel so sorry for you guys that having
 
00:54:05.210 --> 00:54:05.220 align:start position:0%
me on your committee not at all I I
 
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
welcome the questions representative
 
00:54:09.230 --> 00:54:09.240 align:start position:0%
truce seriously um you're brave enough
 
00:54:10.970 --> 00:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
to ask them and there are probably lots
 
00:54:12.349 --> 00:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
of other people that are saying I wonder
 
00:54:16.490 --> 00:54:16.500 align:start position:0%
what that means but don't dare to ask
 
00:54:22.670 --> 00:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
are we trying to work in some proof uh
 
00:54:25.609 --> 00:54:25.619 align:start position:0%
that uh to prevent inflation from
 
00:54:28.430 --> 00:54:28.440 align:start position:0%
weakening your dollar is we can't do
 
00:54:30.290 --> 00:54:30.300 align:start position:0%
that no no no no that's not it go ahead
 
00:54:32.329 --> 00:54:32.339 align:start position:0%
sir not it no not at all it's just
 
00:54:34.010 --> 00:54:34.020 align:start position:0%
saying so and I'll give you a real world
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
example in 1994
 
00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:40.020 align:start position:0%
there was a uh
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
was a Manchester Battalion Chief and and
 
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
I'll only use this as a reference
 
00:54:44.569 --> 00:54:44.579 align:start position:0%
because it was on the front page of the
 
00:54:47.270 --> 00:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
union leader he earned a 25 000 a year
 
00:54:49.849 --> 00:54:49.859 align:start position:0%
pension and that the union leader was
 
00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:52.260 align:start position:0%
deframed as outrageous
 
00:54:54.530 --> 00:54:54.540 align:start position:0%
if 25 the poverty level in New Hampshire
 
00:54:56.870 --> 00:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
is 44 000. my property taxes are 10
 
00:54:59.690 --> 00:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
grand 25 000 pension now would be I
 
00:55:02.390 --> 00:55:02.400 align:start position:0%
would be in a heap of trouble so you the
 
00:55:04.670 --> 00:55:04.680 align:start position:0%
dollar as the dollar moves and the in
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
the the value of the dollar
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
changes through through inflation
 
00:55:12.589 --> 00:55:12.599 align:start position:0%
anytime you have something that's a hard
 
00:55:12.599 --> 00:55:13.670 align:start position:0%
anytime you have something that's a hard
number

00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
number
 
00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:17.640 align:start position:0%
every year that number becomes less and
 
00:55:19.730 --> 00:55:19.740 align:start position:0%
less of a value
 
00:55:21.410 --> 00:55:21.420 align:start position:0%
if there had been a pension caps
 
00:55:24.829 --> 00:55:24.839 align:start position:0%
introduced in 1994 of 25 000 we the
 
00:55:25.970 --> 00:55:25.980 align:start position:0%
legislature would have had to have
 
00:55:28.430 --> 00:55:28.440 align:start position:0%
amended that multiple times because you
 
00:55:29.930 --> 00:55:29.940 align:start position:0%
would have just had Mass retirements
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
when people hit the sale so for
 
00:55:33.589 --> 00:55:33.599 align:start position:0%
clarification again we didn't have a
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
pension cap we didn't exist then we
 
00:55:38.450 --> 00:55:38.460 align:start position:0%
instituted one back in 2000 2009 correct
 
00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
and so once we instituted that pension
 
00:55:43.730 --> 00:55:43.740 align:start position:0%
cap it locked the pension in time it
 
00:55:45.589 --> 00:55:45.599 align:start position:0%
froze it in time and to know how no
 
00:55:47.390 --> 00:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
matter how much inflation happens you
 
00:55:49.250 --> 00:55:49.260 align:start position:0%
could only get 125. this is just saying
 
00:55:52.490 --> 00:55:52.500 align:start position:0%
that as the years go on the cap that and
 
00:55:53.690 --> 00:55:53.700 align:start position:0%
the cap is going to be somewhat
 
00:55:55.010 --> 00:55:55.020 align:start position:0%
controlled by what we're paying them
 
00:55:56.809 --> 00:55:56.819 align:start position:0%
right so I mean
 
00:55:58.250 --> 00:55:58.260 align:start position:0%
um they're not just going to be able to
 
00:55:59.750 --> 00:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
get a higher pension just because the
 
00:56:01.790 --> 00:56:01.800 align:start position:0%
cap goes up we'd have to be paying them
 
00:56:04.069 --> 00:56:04.079 align:start position:0%
more for them to get a larger pension to
 
00:56:06.109 --> 00:56:06.119 align:start position:0%
reach that cap limit it just says that
 
00:56:07.670 --> 00:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
the dollar tomorrow isn't going to be
 
00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
worth what it is today so the cap should
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
be a little bit higher
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
um so that they can get they can get a
 
00:56:15.950 --> 00:56:15.960 align:start position:0%
pension that's in line with the value of
 
00:56:18.170 --> 00:56:18.180 align:start position:0%
the work that they did and in line with
 
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
their with their pay right with their
 
00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319 align:start position:0%
pay the procedure used here and I asked
 
00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
OLS about this because I'm not I'm like
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
you know is this ordered correctly is
 
00:56:27.589 --> 00:56:27.599 align:start position:0%
this something that can be done in
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
statute and I was assured that there are
 
00:56:31.730 --> 00:56:31.740 align:start position:0%
multiple places in statute that have
 
00:56:33.770 --> 00:56:33.780 align:start position:0%
annual ratchetings of things this is not
 
00:56:37.010 --> 00:56:37.020 align:start position:0%
unique in any way and
 
00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:37.809 align:start position:0%
unique in any way and
um

00:56:37.809 --> 00:56:37.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:40.069 --> 00:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
in the future it just saves us from
 
00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
having to it's going to save us some
 
00:56:42.950 --> 00:56:42.960 align:start position:0%
headaches exactly
 
00:56:45.770 --> 00:56:45.780 align:start position:0%
yeah go ahead of course
 
00:56:49.849 --> 00:56:49.859 align:start position:0%
this new wording is saying that the
 
00:56:49.859 --> 00:56:50.809 align:start position:0%
this new wording is saying that the
maximum

00:56:50.809 --> 00:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
maximum
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
pensions you can get is 125.
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
yes that would be the maximum for this
 
00:56:58.809 --> 00:56:58.819 align:start position:0%
year and then next year in January 1 of
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
2025 sorry it would go to 126 563 which
 
00:57:05.930 --> 00:57:05.940 align:start position:0%
is one and a quarter percent above 125
 
00:57:05.940 --> 00:57:07.370 align:start position:0%
is one and a quarter percent above 125
000.

00:57:07.370 --> 00:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
000.
 
00:57:09.950 --> 00:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
yep now keep in mind every year of
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
service someone Works they get two and a
 
00:57:14.569 --> 00:57:14.579 align:start position:0%
half percent this is half of that so at
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
some point in the in the rabbit and hair
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
race it's it's possible to have a
 
00:57:21.470 --> 00:57:21.480 align:start position:0%
collision that would have you leave what
 
00:57:23.930 --> 00:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
we're saying is we don't want the the
 
00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:27.180 align:start position:0%
the tortoise to not move period
 
00:57:28.910 --> 00:57:28.920 align:start position:0%
and once again Chris just for
 
00:57:30.770 --> 00:57:30.780 align:start position:0%
clarification purposes almost nobody
 
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
gets up that high at this point like
 
00:57:35.390 --> 00:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
yeah very very very very rare for that
 
00:57:37.910 --> 00:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
to happen the average ones are way way
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
less it's controlled by what the
 
00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
municipality is paying
 
00:57:44.450 --> 00:57:44.460 align:start position:0%
um so that's that's within a Town's
 
00:57:46.849 --> 00:57:46.859 align:start position:0%
purview as to say what they want to pay
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
because the employee the employees
 
00:57:51.349 --> 00:57:51.359 align:start position:0%
paying in at a rate the employers paying
 
00:57:52.970 --> 00:57:52.980 align:start position:0%
at the rate at a rate they're the ones
 
00:57:54.650 --> 00:57:54.660 align:start position:0%
paying in and so they're the ones who
 
00:57:55.910 --> 00:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
are setting what the person's going to
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
get together we're not setting that for
 
00:58:00.530 --> 00:58:00.540 align:start position:0%
them yes some um you know the you know
 
00:58:02.690 --> 00:58:02.700 align:start position:0%
the way the the cap is written now you
 
00:58:06.049 --> 00:58:06.059 align:start position:0%
had to be uh hired after seven one of 09
 
00:58:08.329 --> 00:58:08.339 align:start position:0%
and not vested by one one of twelve two
 
00:58:10.069 --> 00:58:10.079 align:start position:0%
hit it so there are a few people
 
00:58:12.049 --> 00:58:12.059 align:start position:0%
retiring now
 
00:58:13.849 --> 00:58:13.859 align:start position:0%
um who are getting locked pensions and
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
in excess of 120 000. I I look quickly
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
at the list just over 125 there's
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
currently 39 retirees receiving a
 
00:58:25.490 --> 00:58:25.500 align:start position:0%
pension over 125 right now I'm not sure
 
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
I'm sure there's a few between 120 20
 
00:58:29.750 --> 00:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
and 25 but those are people who
 
00:58:32.329 --> 00:58:32.339 align:start position:0%
were hired invested prior to the effect
 
00:58:36.109 --> 00:58:36.119 align:start position:0%
of the the 120 cap and that's probably
 
00:58:40.370 --> 00:58:40.380 align:start position:0%
people who retired at a high rate of pay
 
00:58:42.829 --> 00:58:42.839 align:start position:0%
and worked for 40 years or so yeah yeah
 
00:58:45.410 --> 00:58:45.420 align:start position:0%
it's primarily group two I think there's
 
00:58:47.390 --> 00:58:47.400 align:start position:0%
a school superintendent in the list as
 
00:58:49.490 --> 00:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
well or somebody who retired as a
 
00:58:50.510 --> 00:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
teacher so I'm assuming they're a
 
00:58:52.010 --> 00:58:52.020 align:start position:0%
superintendent maybe they were principal
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
but again it's all your your pensions
 
00:58:56.569 --> 00:58:56.579 align:start position:0%
are based on years of service and your
 
00:58:58.789 --> 00:58:58.799 align:start position:0%
average final salary so it it you know
 
00:59:01.370 --> 00:59:01.380 align:start position:0%
depending on people who have a lot of
 
00:59:02.809 --> 00:59:02.819 align:start position:0%
service tend to be at the top of their
 
00:59:04.549 --> 00:59:04.559 align:start position:0%
profession and their community and are
 
00:59:06.710 --> 00:59:06.720 align:start position:0%
among the highest paid or the highest
 
00:59:09.770 --> 00:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
paid individuals in those towns so that
 
00:59:12.170 --> 00:59:12.180 align:start position:0%
that's the math is the math nobody gets
 
00:59:13.730 --> 00:59:13.740 align:start position:0%
any deals to get those pensions they
 
00:59:15.230 --> 00:59:15.240 align:start position:0%
they earn them under the current law
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
yeah so if you don't want it in your
 
00:59:18.230 --> 00:59:18.240 align:start position:0%
town just don't pay your people that
 
00:59:19.670 --> 00:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
much so I I have a question for you
 
00:59:22.130 --> 00:59:22.140 align:start position:0%
Marty um of the 39 pensioners above this
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
how many active retire how many retirees
 
00:59:26.809 --> 00:59:26.819 align:start position:0%
exist how many thousands of retirees do
 
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
we have to give you an idea of numbers
 
00:59:31.430 --> 00:59:31.440 align:start position:0%
yeah we've got about 42 000 benefit
 
00:59:35.750 --> 00:59:35.760 align:start position:0%
recipients and I I what I crunch every
 
00:59:38.390 --> 00:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
year for our slides and other handouts
 
00:59:41.390 --> 00:59:41.400 align:start position:0%
is uh the percentage of of retirees
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
earning a benefit in excess of 75 000 I
 
00:59:46.370 --> 00:59:46.380 align:start position:0%
mean I could slice and dice other levels
 
00:59:48.230 --> 00:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
if if you need me to next week but
 
00:59:50.809 --> 00:59:50.819 align:start position:0%
that's less than two percent of the the
 
00:59:55.190 --> 00:59:55.200 align:start position:0%
42 000 total benefits paid uh 94 of
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
people receiving a benefit now it's
 
00:59:58.549 --> 00:59:58.559 align:start position:0%
under 50.
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
so so just to put the framework 39
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
people in 42 000. it's a there's a lot
 
01:00:06.829 --> 01:00:06.839 align:start position:0%
of zeros before you hit a number after
 
01:00:08.870 --> 01:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
that decimal please and that was the
 
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
choice of the municipality that hired
 
01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:13.020 align:start position:0%
them yep so so but again just to prevent
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
you know when you have the opportunity
 
01:00:17.150 --> 01:00:17.160 align:start position:0%
to to fix a couple of things when you're
 
01:00:19.010 --> 01:00:19.020 align:start position:0%
in here when you're when you're going to
 
01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
open this statute up
 
01:00:23.750 --> 01:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
it's time to do like language again
 
01:00:25.490 --> 01:00:25.500 align:start position:0%
reference to language changes definition
 
01:00:27.170 --> 01:00:27.180 align:start position:0%
improvements things like that if you're
 
01:00:28.430 --> 01:00:28.440 align:start position:0%
gonna if you're going to do it just fix
 
01:00:30.289 --> 01:00:30.299 align:start position:0%
fix the things you know need to be fixed
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
now so we're not we're not coming back
 
01:00:34.910 --> 01:00:34.920 align:start position:0%
next term going hey we got to do let's
 
01:00:36.410 --> 01:00:36.420 align:start position:0%
do some language cleanups let's just get
 
01:00:38.329 --> 01:00:38.339 align:start position:0%
it out of the way now and I think the
 
01:00:40.250 --> 01:00:40.260 align:start position:0%
stagnant pension cap is one of those I
 
01:00:41.930 --> 01:00:41.940 align:start position:0%
mean you might I I'm not a question of
 
01:00:43.069 --> 01:00:43.079 align:start position:0%
whether you like it or not you might not
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
like it but do you get it
 
01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.150 align:start position:0%
like it but do you get it
so

01:00:46.150 --> 01:00:46.160 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
there are people who have an exorbitant
 
01:00:53.930 --> 01:00:53.940 align:start position:0%
pension payout there's a couple I mean
 
01:00:55.370 --> 01:00:55.380 align:start position:0%
lesson you couldn't put put them on a
 
01:00:57.770 --> 01:00:57.780 align:start position:0%
school bus yep and that's what's trigger
 
01:01:00.170 --> 01:01:00.180 align:start position:0%
those people are the ones who got
 
01:01:02.690 --> 01:01:02.700 align:start position:0%
exorbitant pay when they were working
 
01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
but this cap says that won't happen
 
01:01:07.789 --> 01:01:07.799 align:start position:0%
again correct that's exactly what that
 
01:01:10.430 --> 01:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
cap says it cannot happen again okay and
 
01:01:11.809 --> 01:01:11.819 align:start position:0%
part of that came through the spiking
 
01:01:13.549 --> 01:01:13.559 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about earlier you
 
01:01:15.289 --> 01:01:15.299 align:start position:0%
know like they they would they would put
 
01:01:16.609 --> 01:01:16.619 align:start position:0%
in that extra time at the end to really
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
drive it up
 
01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:22.619 --> 01:01:24.170 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:24.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:01:28.849 --> 01:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:32.270 --> 01:01:32.280 align:start position:0%
who before this bill
 
01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:34.190 align:start position:0%
who before this bill
was

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:34.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:01:37.870 --> 01:01:37.880 align:start position:0%
having a multiplier of
 
01:01:41.210 --> 01:01:41.220 align:start position:0%
0.021 now has 0.025
 
01:01:45.109 --> 01:01:45.119 align:start position:0%
and they're extended from 24 years to 25
 
01:01:45.119 --> 01:01:48.109 align:start position:0%
and they're extended from 24 years to 25
years

01:01:48.109 --> 01:01:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.690 --> 01:01:52.700 align:start position:0%
and the difference where are you we're
 
01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
you're back on the chart yeah I'm I'm on
 
01:01:57.829 --> 01:01:57.839 align:start position:0%
my chart I'm trying to apply to
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
understand if I thoroughly understand
 
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
what this did
 
01:02:04.010 --> 01:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
yes well we haven't gotten there yet I
 
01:02:05.450 --> 01:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
think it'll be clearer when we get to
 
01:02:08.270 --> 01:02:08.280 align:start position:0%
page well the next one right yeah it's
 
01:02:09.470 --> 01:02:09.480 align:start position:0%
going to start kicking in the next video
 
01:02:11.569 --> 01:02:11.579 align:start position:0%
the boilerplate part kicks in right at
 
01:02:13.670 --> 01:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
the bottom you'll see how it affects the
 
01:02:13.680 --> 01:02:14.690 align:start position:0%
the bottom you'll see how it affects the
chart

01:02:14.690 --> 01:02:14.700 align:start position:0%
chart
 
01:02:14.700 --> 01:02:16.849 align:start position:0%
chart
so

01:02:16.849 --> 01:02:16.859 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
the boilerplate the legalese part you
 
01:02:20.809 --> 01:02:20.819 align:start position:0%
know where I got more Roman numerals
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
than in Athens
 
01:02:24.770 --> 01:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
government building right here but
 
01:02:26.270 --> 01:02:26.280 align:start position:0%
um what this but it's the same every
 
01:02:28.250 --> 01:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
character it is it is what this does is
 
01:02:31.190 --> 01:02:31.200 align:start position:0%
it says every year
 
01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:33.240 align:start position:0%
we're going to transition people back
 
01:02:35.329 --> 01:02:35.339 align:start position:0%
into the system to which they were hired
 
01:02:37.490 --> 01:02:37.500 align:start position:0%
under that is how we make them work the
 
01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:38.760 align:start position:0%
additional year
 
01:02:42.289 --> 01:02:42.299 align:start position:0%
is it with effective dates so
 
01:02:46.130 --> 01:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.390 --> 01:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
every January 1 a new group of people
 
01:02:52.130 --> 01:02:52.140 align:start position:0%
now has the carrot officially has the
 
01:02:54.530 --> 01:02:54.540 align:start position:0%
carrot dangled in front of them if they
 
01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
choose and like I said before in the
 
01:02:57.589 --> 01:02:57.599 align:start position:0%
event that they're burned out or
 
01:02:59.569 --> 01:02:59.579 align:start position:0%
something happens or they they move
 
01:03:02.329 --> 01:03:02.339 align:start position:0%
whatever they just have to go they'll
 
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
just have to go under the current math
 
01:03:06.049 --> 01:03:06.059 align:start position:0%
formula instead of the the incentivized
 
01:03:08.150 --> 01:03:08.160 align:start position:0%
one so if you look at
 
01:03:08.160 --> 01:03:09.230 align:start position:0%
one so if you look at
um

01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
let's just go to let's pick one yeah
 
01:03:14.329 --> 01:03:14.339 align:start position:0%
yeah just pick one um
 
01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:16.380 align:start position:0%
part seven
 
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
that's the first one
 
01:03:20.990 --> 01:03:21.000 align:start position:0%
um you'll see that yeah top of page nine
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
uh line three it'll say subsequent
 
01:03:25.490 --> 01:03:25.500 align:start position:0%
change is effective January 1st 2025. so
 
01:03:28.190 --> 01:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
on January 1st 2025 this will go into
 
01:03:30.049 --> 01:03:30.059 align:start position:0%
effect and before that in fact this is
 
01:03:31.490 --> 01:03:31.500 align:start position:0%
one of the interesting things about this
 
01:03:34.609 --> 01:03:34.619 align:start position:0%
is it amends itself like nine times and
 
01:03:36.410 --> 01:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
so you got to keep up with it as it goes
 
01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
along because every year it changes this
 
01:03:42.109 --> 01:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
document changes itself every year so on
 
01:03:45.049 --> 01:03:45.059 align:start position:0%
2025 all right the effective date that
 
01:03:48.370 --> 01:03:48.380 align:start position:0%
we started with which was um
 
01:03:51.950 --> 01:03:51.960 align:start position:0%
2013 2013 2013. if you look down on line
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
five that every time 2013 shows up as
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
the effective debate now it's going to
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
be 2014. so at that point the group on
 
01:04:02.329 --> 01:04:02.339 align:start position:0%
line 27 of the chart
 
01:04:05.089 --> 01:04:05.099 align:start position:0%
uh less than one or line yeah line no
 
01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:07.380 align:start position:0%
line 28. yeah
 
01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.970 --> 01:04:13.980 align:start position:0%
 yeah just gets deleted and that
 
01:04:15.890 --> 01:04:15.900 align:start position:0%
yeah then those people would go back to
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
the 2.5 multiplier
 
01:04:20.690 --> 01:04:20.700 align:start position:0%
and then the next year it'll get pushed
 
01:04:22.609 --> 01:04:22.619 align:start position:0%
back a year and that next line on the
 
01:04:25.970 --> 01:04:25.980 align:start position:0%
chart will go back to 2.5 percent and
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
then the next year the next group will
 
01:04:30.049 --> 01:04:30.059 align:start position:0%
go to 2.5 it just keeps rolling it back
 
01:04:32.930 --> 01:04:32.940 align:start position:0%
year after year after year until in 33
 
01:04:35.809 --> 01:04:35.819 align:start position:0%
the chance it's obsolete and then and we
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
get rid of the language the language
 
01:04:40.430 --> 01:04:40.440 align:start position:0%
gets the language reverts to instead of
 
01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
having a term of vested it just says you
 
01:04:44.630 --> 01:04:44.640 align:start position:0%
are hired but before July 1 of 11 or you
 
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
are hired after so you'll see that on
 
01:04:50.569 --> 01:04:50.579 align:start position:0%
page 10 uh starting on line 25 you'll
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
start to see that where it says any
 
01:04:54.770 --> 01:04:54.780 align:start position:0%
reference to 2021 that's because the LA
 
01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.299 align:start position:0%
that's the last group's effective date
 
01:04:59.809 --> 01:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
so that's where it will be it at that
 
01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:02.400 align:start position:0%
point the statute will all say effective
 
01:05:04.250 --> 01:05:04.260 align:start position:0%
2021 and then we're going to come in and
 
01:05:06.170 --> 01:05:06.180 align:start position:0%
get rid of that and change the language
 
01:05:06.180 --> 01:05:07.370 align:start position:0%
get rid of that and change the language
to

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:07.380 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:05:09.890 --> 01:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
um who commenced service on 2011. so
 
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
it'll essentially split everybody into
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
two groups the people who started
 
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
serving before 2011 and the people who
 
01:05:19.130 --> 01:05:19.140 align:start position:0%
started serving after 2011. does that
 
01:05:21.349 --> 01:05:21.359 align:start position:0%
make sense and the final the final one
 
01:05:22.970 --> 01:05:22.980 align:start position:0%
is actually only a six month move
 
01:05:25.130 --> 01:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
because it goes from January to July so
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
it's but that's just it's a consistent
 
01:05:29.510 --> 01:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
procedure annually
 
01:05:32.450 --> 01:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
across the board the the with no
 
01:05:34.670 --> 01:05:34.680 align:start position:0%
surprises because it's literally a
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
paragraph repeat eight times they found
 
01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:38.510 align:start position:0%
paragraph repeat eight times they found
that

01:05:38.510 --> 01:05:38.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:40.730 --> 01:05:40.740 align:start position:0%
to reference it using the the sections
 
01:05:43.309 --> 01:05:43.319 align:start position:0%
in Roman numerals this way made this an
 
01:05:47.150 --> 01:05:47.160 align:start position:0%
11 page document instead of a 50 page
 
01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:48.829 align:start position:0%
11 page document instead of a 50 page
document

01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
document
 
01:05:50.690 --> 01:05:50.700 align:start position:0%
and much easier for us to follow oh it's
 
01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:52.450 align:start position:0%
and much easier for us to follow oh it's
easier

01:05:52.450 --> 01:05:52.460 align:start position:0%
easier
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to say that I really
 
01:05:57.370 --> 01:05:57.380 align:start position:0%
appreciate that it is self
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
amending and it includes the entire
 
01:06:03.530 --> 01:06:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:04.910 --> 01:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
so that
 
01:06:06.890 --> 01:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
everybody knows that we're taking care
 
01:06:08.690 --> 01:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
of the whole group with this bill we're
 
01:06:11.150 --> 01:06:11.160 align:start position:0%
not just taking care of this year's
 
01:06:12.950 --> 01:06:12.960 align:start position:0%
property because what will happen is
 
01:06:14.630 --> 01:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
they'll we're just going to keep coming
 
01:06:18.170 --> 01:06:18.180 align:start position:0%
back and no and the speaker the speaker
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
was very clear he looked at me and said
 
01:06:22.609 --> 01:06:22.619 align:start position:0%
how do I how can I can this problem be
 
01:06:24.589 --> 01:06:24.599 align:start position:0%
solved and I said yes and he said can
 
01:06:27.289 --> 01:06:27.299 align:start position:0%
you do it and I said I think so and this
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
solves the problem and we're done with
 
01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:30.470 align:start position:0%
solves the problem and we're done with
this

01:06:30.470 --> 01:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
it's just going to take a little time
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
now as far as the the money part of this
 
01:06:35.880 --> 01:06:36.650 align:start position:0%
now as far as the the money part of this
um

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:36.660 --> 01:06:38.150 align:start position:0%
um
the

01:06:38.150 --> 01:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:40.140 align:start position:0%
we referenced the trout of your bill is
 
01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:41.880 align:start position:0%
the maximum amount because that
 
01:06:44.210 --> 01:06:44.220 align:start position:0%
instantly moved everyone back
 
01:06:46.849 --> 01:06:46.859 align:start position:0%
with no concessions the fiscal note has
 
01:06:48.829 --> 01:06:48.839 align:start position:0%
dropped on that and it is lower than
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
even what you would because it was
 
01:06:55.089 --> 01:06:55.099 align:start position:0%
brought in at 249 it's actually 229.
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
229 129 million
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
before any concessions the speaker will
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
be very happy instantly did it
 
01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:05.339 align:start position:0%
so as far as the what those concessions
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
bring to the financial part of that they
 
01:07:10.089 --> 01:07:10.099 align:start position:0%
have to run an Actuarial on this after
 
01:07:12.049 --> 01:07:12.059 align:start position:0%
so just
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
possibly under 200.
 
01:07:18.109 --> 01:07:18.119 align:start position:0%
you know just when you look at it just
 
01:07:20.089 --> 01:07:20.099 align:start position:0%
sort of as back of the envelope math and
 
01:07:22.190 --> 01:07:22.200 align:start position:0%
there's some changes a little bit in in
 
01:07:24.710 --> 01:07:24.720 align:start position:0%
this bill compared to the referred to as
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
a trading bill because I don't recall
 
01:07:28.370 --> 01:07:28.380 align:start position:0%
the number I think it was 525.
 
01:07:31.309 --> 01:07:31.319 align:start position:0%
um you know so so in all of our brains
 
01:07:34.069 --> 01:07:34.079 align:start position:0%
it seems like it is but Actuarial math
 
01:07:35.630 --> 01:07:35.640 align:start position:0%
is a little bit like particle physics
 
01:07:37.250 --> 01:07:37.260 align:start position:0%
you know the laws of gravity and things
 
01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:39.599 align:start position:0%
don't quite apply the same way right or
 
01:07:42.829 --> 01:07:42.839 align:start position:0%
or non-existent there so I I'd be
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
foreign missed to put a number or even
 
01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
an estimate on it at this point sure but
 
01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
we did um it should definitely be less
 
01:07:55.549 --> 01:07:55.559 align:start position:0%
the funding on line 28 of page 11.
 
01:07:58.789 --> 01:07:58.799 align:start position:0%
should be enough to cover it
 
01:08:01.609 --> 01:08:01.619 align:start position:0%
that's what it feels like in in human
 
01:08:04.670 --> 01:08:04.680 align:start position:0%
terms and so we will I think we should
 
01:08:07.130 --> 01:08:07.140 align:start position:0%
leave that alone and let the actuarius
 
01:08:09.650 --> 01:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
go to actuaries go to work well yeah no
 
01:08:11.089 --> 01:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
the good news is though by the time if
 
01:08:12.230 --> 01:08:12.240 align:start position:0%
we can get this through the house the
 
01:08:13.309 --> 01:08:13.319 align:start position:0%
first time by the time it gets to
 
01:08:15.109 --> 01:08:15.119 align:start position:0%
finance we should have that number and
 
01:08:16.729 --> 01:08:16.739 align:start position:0%
they can amend us to match that number
 
01:08:19.249 --> 01:08:19.259 align:start position:0%
if they need to or they could just put a
 
01:08:20.570 --> 01:08:20.580 align:start position:0%
little extra in or they can just put on
 
01:08:23.470 --> 01:08:23.480 align:start position:0%
especially in a down stock market
 
01:08:26.510 --> 01:08:26.520 align:start position:0%
right because because it's not even
 
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
though it the concept is a flat fund the
 
01:08:30.769 --> 01:08:30.779 align:start position:0%
reality is is that
 
01:08:33.950 --> 01:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
Market changes later right as the market
 
01:08:33.960 --> 01:08:35.650 align:start position:0%
Market changes later right as the market
improves

01:08:35.650 --> 01:08:35.660 align:start position:0%
improves
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
this number
 
01:08:41.749 --> 01:08:41.759 align:start position:0%
could drop based on Market Improvement
 
01:08:44.329 --> 01:08:44.339 align:start position:0%
in all that so you know just like the
 
01:08:45.530 --> 01:08:45.540 align:start position:0%
rest of the system does right so the
 
01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:48.900 align:start position:0%
actuaries are are I'm not gonna I'm not
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
going to devalue what they do for a
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
career by referring to them as as is
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
financial weathermen but they kind of
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
are in a way because they have to make
 
01:08:59.349 --> 01:08:59.359 align:start position:0%
assumptions on some things in the future
 
01:09:03.229 --> 01:09:03.239 align:start position:0%
based on a a best guess and as we have
 
01:09:04.669 --> 01:09:04.679 align:start position:0%
seen in the last especially the last
 
01:09:07.150 --> 01:09:07.160 align:start position:0%
four years the actuaries have become
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
more and more conservative in their
 
01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:10.910 align:start position:0%
more and more conservative in their
thinking

01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
thinking
 
01:09:13.970 --> 01:09:13.980 align:start position:0%
with with attaching a little bit higher
 
01:09:15.370 --> 01:09:15.380 align:start position:0%
cost to things
 
01:09:19.010 --> 01:09:19.020 align:start position:0%
so that we kind of almost guarantee we
 
01:09:20.809 --> 01:09:20.819 align:start position:0%
don't get into trouble right well and
 
01:09:22.729 --> 01:09:22.739 align:start position:0%
the difference with this though is we're
 
01:09:24.590 --> 01:09:24.600 align:start position:0%
funding this we're not we're not sending
 
01:09:26.090 --> 01:09:26.100 align:start position:0%
this back to the municipalities this is
 
01:09:27.709 --> 01:09:27.719 align:start position:0%
coming right out of the general fund so
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
correct it's a little bit different that
 
01:09:30.829 --> 01:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
way too as far as like the rate
 
01:09:33.169 --> 01:09:33.179 align:start position:0%
adjustment would potentially happen like
 
01:09:34.910 --> 01:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
in comparison with with the rate of
 
01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:37.510 align:start position:0%
in comparison with with the rate of
return

01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
to the extent that if this went through
 
01:09:43.249 --> 01:09:43.259 align:start position:0%
at a 25 million year appropriation for
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
10 years and some of that not that and
 
01:09:48.890 --> 01:09:48.900 align:start position:0%
that total amount wasn't needed to to
 
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
pay the benefits accrued here that would
 
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
be what's called an actual real gain and
 
01:09:55.189 --> 01:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
it would lower employer contribution
 
01:09:57.229 --> 01:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
rates you know all in group two for all
 
01:10:00.229 --> 01:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
both state and local right the anything
 
01:10:02.930 --> 01:10:02.940 align:start position:0%
over you know is it well you know moving
 
01:10:04.910 --> 01:10:04.920 align:start position:0%
all the other assumptions are met any
 
01:10:07.310 --> 01:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
extra money we over and you know
 
01:10:10.070 --> 01:10:10.080 align:start position:0%
anything in the 25 million that doesn't
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
is over what's needed to fund this is a
 
01:10:14.209 --> 01:10:14.219 align:start position:0%
tax reduction to the municipalities you
 
01:10:16.010 --> 01:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
know and it it saves you interest in the
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
long run and yeah you know Etc so that's
 
01:10:20.450 --> 01:10:20.460 align:start position:0%
another benefit if it comes in cheaper
 
01:10:22.850 --> 01:10:22.860 align:start position:0%
we get to give we get to send a bit of a
 
01:10:24.890 --> 01:10:24.900 align:start position:0%
tax break down to the municipalities
 
01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:26.390 align:start position:0%
tax break down to the municipalities
yeah

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:10:28.850 --> 01:10:28.860 align:start position:0%
that's not bad which they won't complain
 
01:10:30.530 --> 01:10:30.540 align:start position:0%
about it
 
01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:33.470 align:start position:0%
about it
yep

01:10:33.470 --> 01:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:36.590 --> 01:10:36.600 align:start position:0%
so Chris it's the opposite of 28a you
 
01:10:38.209 --> 01:10:38.219 align:start position:0%
know actually it is the opposite it's
 
01:10:40.850 --> 01:10:40.860 align:start position:0%
the opposite so I mean if so that's
 
01:10:42.530 --> 01:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
that's the gist of this that like I said
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
before there's it's as we explained in
 
01:10:47.090 --> 01:10:47.100 align:start position:0%
the in the first presentation this is
 
01:10:48.950 --> 01:10:48.960 align:start position:0%
this is how it was when we first
 
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
explained it so there's nothing hidden
 
01:10:53.030 --> 01:10:53.040 align:start position:0%
in here there's no there's no secret
 
01:10:54.890 --> 01:10:54.900 align:start position:0%
agenda there's no weird Roman numeral
 
01:10:56.870 --> 01:10:56.880 align:start position:0%
that no one knows about this is
 
01:10:58.790 --> 01:10:58.800 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily straightforward it is
 
01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
exactly as was presented and it does
 
01:11:03.410 --> 01:11:03.420 align:start position:0%
nothing more or nothing less than what
 
01:11:05.090 --> 01:11:05.100 align:start position:0%
is written that was my impression I've
 
01:11:06.709 --> 01:11:06.719 align:start position:0%
gone through it line by line in return
 
01:11:08.750 --> 01:11:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know with the books and it is it's
 
01:11:11.270 --> 01:11:11.280 align:start position:0%
exactly the same Marty's job is is if
 
01:11:14.209 --> 01:11:14.219 align:start position:0%
there was something yes
 
01:11:17.030 --> 01:11:17.040 align:start position:0%
so besides the cleanup
 
01:11:19.970 --> 01:11:19.980 align:start position:0%
the policy changes that are made here
 
01:11:19.980 --> 01:11:23.870 align:start position:0%
the policy changes that are made here
are

01:11:23.870 --> 01:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.729 align:start position:0%
 
two

01:11:25.729 --> 01:11:25.739 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:11:28.790 --> 01:11:28.800 align:start position:0%
in a phased way delete that
 
01:11:32.810 --> 01:11:32.820 align:start position:0%
table of lesser retirement benefits
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
and change the
 
01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:39.649 align:start position:0%
and change the
um

01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.330 --> 01:11:44.340 align:start position:0%
the average the the limit on
 
01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:47.580 align:start position:0%
maximum pension for people in that group
 
01:11:49.370 --> 01:11:49.380 align:start position:0%
to a hundred percent of final
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
compensation rather than 85 percent
 
01:11:57.110 --> 01:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
so that is two separate changes to the
 
01:11:59.930 --> 01:11:59.940 align:start position:0%
possible pension of people in that group
 
01:12:03.410 --> 01:12:03.420 align:start position:0%
one is the deletion of of lines one by
 
01:12:07.490 --> 01:12:07.500 align:start position:0%
one and the other is the increase in the
 
01:12:13.010 --> 01:12:13.020 align:start position:0%
um the maximum final pension as a
 
01:12:14.930 --> 01:12:14.940 align:start position:0%
percent to a higher percentage of their
 
01:12:17.149 --> 01:12:17.159 align:start position:0%
pay and there's one other
 
01:12:20.450 --> 01:12:20.460 align:start position:0%
the one other is is that with the with
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
the maximum
 
01:12:24.649 --> 01:12:24.659 align:start position:0%
benefit the inflation adjustment
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
inflation adjustment would hold true to
 
01:12:29.630 --> 01:12:29.640 align:start position:0%
all folks
 
01:12:34.430 --> 01:12:34.440 align:start position:0%
all folks from 2001 forward okay so that
 
01:12:36.530 --> 01:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
that would be the any that's the only
 
01:12:38.689 --> 01:12:38.699 align:start position:0%
change for a for someone hired July 1 of
 
01:12:38.699 --> 01:12:39.890 align:start position:0%
change for a for someone hired July 1 of
11.

01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
11.
 
01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
would be the pension caps because I
 
01:12:45.169 --> 01:12:45.179 align:start position:0%
found it and also thank you for
 
01:12:48.950 --> 01:12:48.960 align:start position:0%
reminding me yeah the policy online page
 
01:12:51.470 --> 01:12:51.480 align:start position:0%
one line six and seven that is not
 
01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:55.140 align:start position:0%
reducing the calculations after three
 
01:12:57.310 --> 01:12:57.320 align:start position:0%
years of service correct that is that is
 
01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:00.120 align:start position:0%
a policy change okay
 
01:13:02.450 --> 01:13:02.460 align:start position:0%
I think we need and I and I hope my
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
explanation is to why I feel that needs
 
01:13:06.709 --> 01:13:06.719 align:start position:0%
to be there you understand whether you
 
01:13:07.610 --> 01:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
agree with it or not but you at least
 
01:13:09.770 --> 01:13:09.780 align:start position:0%
understand the methodology as to why no
 
01:13:11.689 --> 01:13:11.699 align:start position:0%
I I understand it and I just want to
 
01:13:13.250 --> 01:13:13.260 align:start position:0%
make it
 
01:13:14.750 --> 01:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
um I mean this is big enough that it
 
01:13:17.030 --> 01:13:17.040 align:start position:0%
it's important to separate the policy
 
01:13:19.790 --> 01:13:19.800 align:start position:0%
decisions from the language cleanup to
 
01:13:21.950 --> 01:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
implement those decisions okay so we're
 
01:13:25.490 --> 01:13:25.500 align:start position:0%
making a decision on the maximum final
 
01:13:28.130 --> 01:13:28.140 align:start position:0%
compensation we're deleting the chart
 
01:13:30.470 --> 01:13:30.480 align:start position:0%
face by face and we're limiting changes
 
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
after three years of service right
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
correct plus you know changing the
 
01:13:36.050 --> 01:13:36.060 align:start position:0%
language to agree with those things
 
01:13:36.060 --> 01:13:37.209 align:start position:0%
language to agree with those things
right

01:13:37.209 --> 01:13:37.219 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:13:40.970 --> 01:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:42.649 --> 01:13:42.659 align:start position:0%
it's a lot man we've been looking at
 
01:13:46.310 --> 01:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:48.169 --> 01:13:48.179 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
01:13:53.209 --> 01:13:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.950 --> 01:13:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:01.850 --> 01:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
250. it's 2 30. oh it is going to change
 
01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:05.520 align:start position:0%
230 Maps there was a the trotty the
 
01:14:07.070 --> 01:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note on the chart of your bill
 
01:14:09.350 --> 01:14:09.360 align:start position:0%
just hit a couple of days ago and it's
 
01:14:11.689 --> 01:14:11.699 align:start position:0%
it was estimated at 249 it's actually
 
01:14:14.630 --> 01:14:14.640 align:start position:0%
229 maximum this is going to be less
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
than that but but that's before we phase
 
01:14:19.490 --> 01:14:19.500 align:start position:0%
it out right so what as Steve was saying
 
01:14:21.950 --> 01:14:21.960 align:start position:0%
before as you keep people on another
 
01:14:24.410 --> 01:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
year they're paying in they're not
 
01:14:27.830 --> 01:14:27.840 align:start position:0%
taking out so that 229 is everybody Jets
 
01:14:30.649 --> 01:14:30.659 align:start position:0%
right away and and joins the system
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
because we have added concessions it's
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
gonna drop that price so that was the
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
question I was asking is is it
 
01:14:40.070 --> 01:14:40.080 align:start position:0%
potentially less than 200 I think it it
 
01:14:42.050 --> 01:14:42.060 align:start position:0%
is potentially we don't have a hard
 
01:14:43.610 --> 01:14:43.620 align:start position:0%
number on that so we don't know but
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
Finance can take care of that component
 
01:14:47.270 --> 01:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
of it they'll have the number by then
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
they can look at it and make a
 
01:14:50.630 --> 01:14:50.640 align:start position:0%
determination based off of the expense
 
01:14:54.169 --> 01:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
of the bill uh our main concern here our
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
primary concern because we don't have
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
that number specifically is whether or
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
not the policy itself is right and good
 
01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
and we think that it should move forward
 
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
and then if we can get the house to
 
01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
agree with that Finance can really get
 
01:15:07.010 --> 01:15:07.020 align:start position:0%
fine and then you'll have another chance
 
01:15:09.169 --> 01:15:09.179 align:start position:0%
to to speak to whether or not you like
 
01:15:10.490 --> 01:15:10.500 align:start position:0%
the expense of it because it's going to
 
01:15:12.350 --> 01:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
go to finance come back the other point
 
01:15:14.990 --> 01:15:15.000 align:start position:0%
is that the other policy decision is
 
01:15:17.090 --> 01:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
that this be paid from the general fund
 
01:15:19.669 --> 01:15:19.679 align:start position:0%
rather than from employer contributions
 
01:15:22.010 --> 01:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
which for group two are largely for
 
01:15:25.130 --> 01:15:25.140 align:start position:0%
municipalities yeah so this says that we
 
01:15:26.209 --> 01:15:26.219 align:start position:0%
will pay
 
01:15:28.669 --> 01:15:28.679 align:start position:0%
the approximate cost on a you know
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
10-year flat funded which will
 
01:15:34.130 --> 01:15:34.140 align:start position:0%
first of all rather than the method we
 
01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:36.440 align:start position:0%
usually use it will get more of the cost
 
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
into the system earlier which is more
 
01:15:42.610 --> 01:15:42.620 align:start position:0%
effective and it will make sure that the
 
01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
municipalities don't have to pay
 
01:15:48.050 --> 01:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
anything for the exchange right
 
01:15:50.209 --> 01:15:50.219 align:start position:0%
no doubt no downshifting
 
01:15:53.149 --> 01:15:53.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:56.149 --> 01:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
so there may be some money
 
01:15:57.890 --> 01:15:57.900 align:start position:0%
not spent
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
maybe and if it's not spent of the 229
 
01:16:05.689 --> 01:16:05.699 align:start position:0%
that would go back to the town it would
 
01:16:07.010 --> 01:16:07.020 align:start position:0%
go back to the sounds it will go into a
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
rate reduction right recalculate what
 
01:16:11.689 --> 01:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
they pay yeah
 
01:16:14.930 --> 01:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
and two two things if I may
 
01:16:17.870 --> 01:16:17.880 align:start position:0%
uh so I can shut my mic off
 
01:16:17.880 --> 01:16:20.689 align:start position:0%
uh so I can shut my mic off
um

01:16:20.689 --> 01:16:20.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:23.209 --> 01:16:23.219 align:start position:0%
I'm sure
 
01:16:26.090 --> 01:16:26.100 align:start position:0%
maybe uh later on in committee
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
will go over those policy changes and
 
01:16:30.649 --> 01:16:30.659 align:start position:0%
explain them all again
 
01:16:33.169 --> 01:16:33.179 align:start position:0%
to somebody say like not a not a really
 
01:16:35.570 --> 01:16:35.580 align:start position:0%
brilliant first grade person but uh
 
01:16:37.430 --> 01:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
somebody who's an average first grader
 
01:16:39.290 --> 01:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
will be able to explain those policies
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
so they could explain it to somebody
 
01:16:43.910 --> 01:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
else yes either either Carol or I will
 
01:16:45.410 --> 01:16:45.420 align:start position:0%
do our best to come up with some
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
language that's uh accessible thank you
 
01:16:50.330 --> 01:16:50.340 align:start position:0%
and and I did have one more this solves
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
the problem
 
01:16:54.169 --> 01:16:54.179 align:start position:0%
what's the problem that we just solved
 
01:16:55.570 --> 01:16:55.580 align:start position:0%
so the problem
 
01:16:58.310 --> 01:16:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay so so
 
01:17:01.790 --> 01:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
the the prep I I will say that the the
 
01:17:05.750 --> 01:17:05.760 align:start position:0%
problem this is is both a uh in my
 
01:17:07.970 --> 01:17:07.980 align:start position:0%
opinion representative Schmidt a
 
01:17:10.490 --> 01:17:10.500 align:start position:0%
constitutional problem and a moral
 
01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:12.600 align:start position:0%
problem in the sense that
 
01:17:14.270 --> 01:17:14.280 align:start position:0%
uh article 23 of the New Hampshire
 
01:17:17.770 --> 01:17:17.780 align:start position:0%
Constitution says you don't go backwards
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
retroactive law is injurious it's
 
01:17:21.649 --> 01:17:21.659 align:start position:0%
harmful and it shouldn't be done that
 
01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
was added in 1784. so like in the way
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
that I interpret the changes that
 
01:17:29.870 --> 01:17:29.880 align:start position:0%
happened in 2011 the way that the
 
01:17:31.370 --> 01:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
majority of the folks that were affected
 
01:17:33.950 --> 01:17:33.960 align:start position:0%
by this look at this they say hey I took
 
01:17:36.229 --> 01:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
a job you told me what was going on and
 
01:17:37.729 --> 01:17:37.739 align:start position:0%
then nine years later you made a change
 
01:17:38.930 --> 01:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
to folks
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
but except that instead of just making a
 
01:17:44.770 --> 01:17:44.780 align:start position:0%
change for new hires you went backwards
 
01:17:47.450 --> 01:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
retroactively 10 years
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
that to me is a retroactive change of
 
01:17:51.950 --> 01:17:51.960 align:start position:0%
Law and it flies in the face of article
 
01:17:51.960 --> 01:17:55.010 align:start position:0%
Law and it flies in the face of article
23.

01:17:55.010 --> 01:17:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:57.050 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:17:57.050 --> 01:17:57.060 align:start position:0%
yep
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
and the changes we're making here aren't
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
going back in time
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
the changes we're making here are rip
 
01:18:07.310 --> 01:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
are fixing what I interpret and others
 
01:18:08.990 --> 01:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
interpret as a violation of the
 
01:18:11.229 --> 01:18:11.239 align:start position:0%
Constitution this undoes the violation
 
01:18:14.450 --> 01:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
and technically we're repealing statute
 
01:18:17.209 --> 01:18:17.219 align:start position:0%
which we do frequently so there are laws
 
01:18:18.649 --> 01:18:18.659 align:start position:0%
that are already in place this is
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
essentially repealing things
 
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
that that were put into so whereas the
 
01:18:24.709 --> 01:18:24.719 align:start position:0%
law that was put in place before
 
01:18:24.719 --> 01:18:27.050 align:start position:0%
law that was put in place before
retroactively

01:18:27.050 --> 01:18:27.060 align:start position:0%
retroactively
 
01:18:30.649 --> 01:18:30.659 align:start position:0%
in injured people we're now going back
 
01:18:32.570 --> 01:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
to that law and we're repealing it step
 
01:18:34.189 --> 01:18:34.199 align:start position:0%
by step we're getting rid of it does
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
that make sense and if I are we close to
 
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
wrapping up yes you think very you think
 
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
so huh no no no I'm not in any hurry
 
01:18:46.729 --> 01:18:46.739 align:start position:0%
yeah okay I I I don't have to go
 
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
anywhere Chris I I just I I do but I do
 
01:18:53.050 --> 01:18:53.060 align:start position:0%
I have to go to work but I truly do
 
01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
keep coming with the questions I I want
 
01:18:57.890 --> 01:18:57.900 align:start position:0%
I don't want you to leave here
 
01:19:00.050 --> 01:19:00.060 align:start position:0%
with not understanding something if if
 
01:19:03.110 --> 01:19:03.120 align:start position:0%
now's the opportunity I have until three
 
01:19:05.149 --> 01:19:05.159 align:start position:0%
so because there's another gentleman at
 
01:19:07.189 --> 01:19:07.199 align:start position:0%
that table who handed out a very nice
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
yeah he's he's next yeah okay yeah
 
01:19:11.750 --> 01:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
because okay yes awesome yeah you can
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
get out of here
 
01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.209 align:start position:0%
get out of here
[Laughter]

01:19:14.209 --> 01:19:14.219 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:19:16.010 --> 01:19:16.020 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Truth for your
 
01:19:18.890 --> 01:19:18.900 align:start position:0%
procedurally you're taking this down to
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
OLS to get it revised correct
 
01:19:23.990 --> 01:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
where are you do you have time do you
 
01:19:25.370 --> 01:19:25.380 align:start position:0%
want someone else to since you're not
 
01:19:27.169 --> 01:19:27.179 align:start position:0%
here I can do it I can do it right now
 
01:19:29.689 --> 01:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
if I go down there right now
 
01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:31.980 align:start position:0%
um so just for clarification you're
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
asking for things that should have been
 
01:19:34.669 --> 01:19:34.679 align:start position:0%
in bold to be put in bold I would like
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
to see them involved gotcha
 
01:19:38.870 --> 01:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
the cleanup language that was this there
 
01:19:40.310 --> 01:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
this is from everything that you got
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
from nhrs yep we've got that figured out
 
01:19:44.990 --> 01:19:45.000 align:start position:0%
and we're changing 85 percent to a
 
01:19:46.550 --> 01:19:46.560 align:start position:0%
hundred percent five to a hundred I've
 
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
got that and and a couple of more you
 
01:19:52.310 --> 01:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
want the last four pages in bold as well
 
01:19:53.810 --> 01:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
I want last four pages involved so that
 
01:19:55.130 --> 01:19:55.140 align:start position:0%
when it goes to the committee again that
 
01:19:56.689 --> 01:19:56.699 align:start position:0%
they know that those are actual changes
 
01:20:04.090 --> 01:20:04.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
because I recognize some conflicts that
 
01:20:09.290 --> 01:20:09.300 align:start position:0%
at least I'd like to have a draft and
 
01:20:12.530 --> 01:20:12.540 align:start position:0%
have uh Community representative Pearson
 
01:20:15.770 --> 01:20:15.780 align:start position:0%
let's explain it I'm amendable to that
 
01:20:17.570 --> 01:20:17.580 align:start position:0%
page four
 
01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
again just my clarification online line
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
four on page four it says for group two
 
01:20:25.430 --> 01:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
members who have not attained vested
 
01:20:29.630 --> 01:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
status by the January 113 the full base
 
01:20:31.790 --> 01:20:31.800 align:start position:0%
rate compensation paid as determined by
 
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
the employer plus compensation over base
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
pay then it goes and States what the
 
01:20:39.649 --> 01:20:39.659 align:start position:0%
compensation is but then if you go back
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
to line uh 14 it says honorable
 
01:20:43.970 --> 01:20:43.980 align:start position:0%
compensation shall not include
 
01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:46.320 align:start position:0%
compensation thank you yeah
 
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
for members commence service on or after
 
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
July of 2011. here go ahead Steve if I
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.510 --> 01:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
but not because you would not be vested
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
prior to January 1 of 13 if you were
 
01:21:04.669 --> 01:21:04.679 align:start position:0%
hired in 2012. but no it say the first
 
01:21:07.130 --> 01:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
paragraph says we have not attained
 
01:21:10.130 --> 01:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
vested status right prior to 13. so if I
 
01:21:10.140 --> 01:21:11.930 align:start position:0%
vested status right prior to 13. so if I
correct

01:21:11.930 --> 01:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:21:14.770 --> 01:21:14.780 align:start position:0%
so it covers the if you're in 12.
 
01:21:17.570 --> 01:21:17.580 align:start position:0%
no no it doesn't because you did not
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
obtain vested staff no that's what I'm
 
01:21:21.410 --> 01:21:21.420 align:start position:0%
saying it's it's never mind you go ahead
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
so so what what that the the line two
 
01:21:26.810 --> 01:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
the earnerable compensation who commits
 
01:21:28.430 --> 01:21:28.440 align:start position:0%
service after July 1 of 11 that's
 
01:21:31.130 --> 01:21:31.140 align:start position:0%
already statute that's not a change that
 
01:21:35.689 --> 01:21:35.699 align:start position:0%
that's already in the in the RSA
 
01:21:35.699 --> 01:21:37.550 align:start position:0%
that's already in the in the RSA
so

01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:21:39.890 --> 01:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
there's no there's no change there
 
01:21:43.970 --> 01:21:43.980 align:start position:0%
for the first that January on line five
 
01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
you're going to be changing that date
 
01:21:50.229 --> 01:21:50.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
so that it'll start
 
01:21:57.770 --> 01:21:57.780 align:start position:0%
if you're hired after July 2011
 
01:22:00.950 --> 01:22:00.960 align:start position:0%
you do not get to include comp extra and
 
01:22:03.169 --> 01:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
special pay period ever so so to
 
01:22:04.970 --> 01:22:04.980 align:start position:0%
translate this out of a vested world
 
01:22:07.090 --> 01:22:07.100 align:start position:0%
into a hiring world
 
01:22:09.530 --> 01:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
this the first sentence says for group
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
two members hired prior to January 1 of
 
01:22:12.600 --> 01:22:16.310 align:start position:0%
two members hired prior to January 1 of
2003.

01:22:16.310 --> 01:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:19.010 --> 01:22:19.020 align:start position:0%
in essence that's what that says one of
 
01:22:20.149 --> 01:22:20.159 align:start position:0%
them's best said the others hired
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
because because that's what if it takes
 
01:22:23.810 --> 01:22:23.820 align:start position:0%
10 years to best
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
then that's generally one of O3 is right
 
01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
is a vesting of January 1 of 13.
 
01:22:32.810 --> 01:22:32.820 align:start position:0%
does that make sense it's the same thing
 
01:22:35.450 --> 01:22:35.460 align:start position:0%
just said two different ways
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
with the without getting into the Weeds
 
01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
about turning 65 and all the little tiny
 
01:22:42.709 --> 01:22:42.719 align:start position:0%
things that can exist but for the most
 
01:22:42.719 --> 01:22:43.970 align:start position:0%
things that can exist but for the most
part

01:22:43.970 --> 01:22:43.980 align:start position:0%
part
 
01:22:46.729 --> 01:22:46.739 align:start position:0%
that's that's what that is so so like so
 
01:22:48.470 --> 01:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
paragraph two is is not a change that
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:56.450 --> 01:22:56.460 align:start position:0%
that reads members who were hired prior
 
01:22:59.390 --> 01:22:59.400 align:start position:0%
to January 1 of 03. and then next year
 
01:23:02.270 --> 01:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
it would be January 104 and then January
 
01:23:05.270 --> 01:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
1 of 05. because they they need 10 years
 
01:23:06.950 --> 01:23:06.960 align:start position:0%
to get vested
 
01:23:08.630 --> 01:23:08.640 align:start position:0%
and then line 14 has to do with when
 
01:23:10.250 --> 01:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
they start working not when when they're
 
01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:11.330 align:start position:0%
they start working not when when they're
vested

01:23:11.330 --> 01:23:11.340 align:start position:0%
vested
 
01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
I hate the term I wish we didn't use the
 
01:23:16.550 --> 01:23:16.560 align:start position:0%
term vested status yeah but because of a
 
01:23:18.290 --> 01:23:18.300 align:start position:0%
couple of rare conditions that exist
 
01:23:21.470 --> 01:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
under the retirement rules right now
 
01:23:23.689 --> 01:23:23.699 align:start position:0%
we're stuck with it I would prefer to
 
01:23:25.189 --> 01:23:25.199 align:start position:0%
just have a hiring date does that does
 
01:23:26.870 --> 01:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
that make sense to you
 
01:23:28.250 --> 01:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
they still look
 
01:23:29.890 --> 01:23:29.900 align:start position:0%
at it yeah
 
01:23:32.390 --> 01:23:32.400 align:start position:0%
yeah reading it seems complicated it
 
01:23:34.189 --> 01:23:34.199 align:start position:0%
could be because of technical things
 
01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
with how we have to write it it that
 
01:23:38.930 --> 01:23:38.940 align:start position:0%
line for Steve said could read for those
 
01:23:38.940 --> 01:23:40.610 align:start position:0%
line for Steve said could read for those
who

01:23:40.610 --> 01:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
who
 
01:23:43.010 --> 01:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
um hire after all well yeah a commenced
 
01:23:47.630 --> 01:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
service on or after January 1 of 2003.
 
01:23:53.090 --> 01:23:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:55.189 --> 01:23:55.199 align:start position:0%
little things in there that but it does
 
01:23:56.930 --> 01:23:56.940 align:start position:0%
it does cover the concern that you have
 
01:23:59.990 --> 01:24:00.000 align:start position:0%
people people are covered
 
01:24:03.290 --> 01:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph is how compensate
 
01:24:05.209 --> 01:24:05.219 align:start position:0%
comp over base is calculated for anybody
 
01:24:07.790 --> 01:24:07.800 align:start position:0%
who is invested period and then the next
 
01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
paragraph takes out one more pay type
 
01:24:11.870 --> 01:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
out of that for anybody hired after
 
01:24:13.910 --> 01:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
seven one of eleven that's how that's
 
01:24:15.950 --> 01:24:15.960 align:start position:0%
how it was constructed back in 11 it's
 
01:24:17.930 --> 01:24:17.940 align:start position:0%
like you know they you know it's this
 
01:24:20.030 --> 01:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
this and this for anybody who's not
 
01:24:22.310 --> 01:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
vested oh by the way anybody who started
 
01:24:24.410 --> 01:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
after this this isn't in there either so
 
01:24:26.570 --> 01:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
that that construction-wise that that is
 
01:24:28.550 --> 01:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
even though it's
 
01:24:30.830 --> 01:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
um bold italic here that's actually the
 
01:24:33.610 --> 01:24:33.620 align:start position:0%
current statue yep
 
01:24:46.810 --> 01:24:46.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:50.510 --> 01:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
correct that is the one date that has to
 
01:24:54.350 --> 01:24:54.360 align:start position:0%
remain the same because it is how much
 
01:24:59.149 --> 01:24:59.159 align:start position:0%
time did you have based on January 1 of
 
01:25:02.750 --> 01:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
12. if you were to move that you would
 
01:25:06.890 --> 01:25:06.900 align:start position:0%
have a moving chart right that cannot
 
01:25:09.110 --> 01:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
exist in the way that this is being
 
01:25:10.970 --> 01:25:10.980 align:start position:0%
removed because that is the one place
 
01:25:13.189 --> 01:25:13.199 align:start position:0%
that it must remain that date that that
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
that date there that 2012 indicates how
 
01:25:19.669 --> 01:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
we read the chart so on 12 if you have
 
01:25:21.770 --> 01:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
one year of service which would push you
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
out to the 13. and if you and if you
 
01:25:27.169 --> 01:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
look at the at the legalese at the back
 
01:25:29.810 --> 01:25:29.820 align:start position:0%
that does the annual shifting
 
01:25:33.370 --> 01:25:33.380 align:start position:0%
it refers to that
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
specifically exempts the the table pair
 
01:25:39.110 --> 01:25:39.120 align:start position:0%
the table I forget the word he uses but
 
01:25:39.120 --> 01:25:40.070 align:start position:0%
the table I forget the word he uses but
it's

01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:25:42.050 --> 01:25:42.060 align:start position:0%
uh except table heading except table
 
01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
heading because the table heading cannot
 
01:25:45.649 --> 01:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
change it has to stay that would that
 
01:25:47.270 --> 01:25:47.280 align:start position:0%
would unravel this whole thing if the
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:26:05.149 --> 01:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
six on page eight because on line 34
 
01:26:07.610 --> 01:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
you've stopped taking those vehicle you
 
01:26:09.770 --> 01:26:09.780 align:start position:0%
they they have to be there so we can
 
01:26:11.810 --> 01:26:11.820 align:start position:0%
take them off they also have to be there
 
01:26:15.410 --> 01:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
in case somebody does choose to leave
 
01:26:17.689 --> 01:26:17.699 align:start position:0%
prior to the implementation of this
 
01:26:19.729 --> 01:26:19.739 align:start position:0%
there has to be a way to calculate their
 
01:26:19.739 --> 01:26:20.810 align:start position:0%
there has to be a way to calculate their
benefit

01:26:20.810 --> 01:26:20.820 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
01:26:23.270 --> 01:26:23.280 align:start position:0%
if they choose not to have take the
 
01:26:26.330 --> 01:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
incentive and do the other year
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
otherwise there'd be no guidance it's
 
01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:29.280 align:start position:0%
just how that would work yeah that makes
 
01:26:29.280 --> 01:26:30.770 align:start position:0%
just how that would work yeah that makes
sense

01:26:30.770 --> 01:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:26:32.930 --> 01:26:32.940 align:start position:0%
thank you very much oh of course any
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
okay this is this
 
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:40.139 align:start position:0%
stuff is so complicated that anybody who
 
01:26:42.169 --> 01:26:42.179 align:start position:0%
asks a question will probably Enlighten
 
01:26:44.330 --> 01:26:44.340 align:start position:0%
everybody in the room yeah
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
I I do want to
 
01:26:48.850 --> 01:26:48.860 align:start position:0%
um just thank representative Pearson
 
01:26:50.750 --> 01:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
really very well done and for my from my
 
01:26:55.010 --> 01:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
perspective I don't know how Jeff feels
 
01:26:57.350 --> 01:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
about it but I like it
 
01:26:59.270 --> 01:26:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's it all right all right very good
 
01:27:01.729 --> 01:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
uh it's three three weeks of no sleep
 
01:27:01.739 --> 01:27:02.709 align:start position:0%
uh it's three three weeks of no sleep
yeah

01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:27:05.570 --> 01:27:05.580 align:start position:0%
and I still and I'm still going to OLS
 
01:27:07.850 --> 01:27:07.860 align:start position:0%
right now yeah so and to everybody
 
01:27:10.490 --> 01:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
everybody who's in the room we we do
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
have we do want this to work
 
01:27:14.209 --> 01:27:14.219 align:start position:0%
um for sure and we want to make sure
 
01:27:15.770 --> 01:27:15.780 align:start position:0%
that it's written correctly so if we run
 
01:27:17.209 --> 01:27:17.219 align:start position:0%
into anything that we feel like is
 
01:27:19.490 --> 01:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
compromising the goal we'll make sure
 
01:27:21.110 --> 01:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
that it gets fixed along the way but
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
this looks really solid so nice job yes
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
and the the point of the phasing is to
 
01:27:30.169 --> 01:27:30.179 align:start position:0%
provide a
 
01:27:30.179 --> 01:27:31.629 align:start position:0%
provide a
a

01:27:31.629 --> 01:27:31.639 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:27:34.430 --> 01:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
incentive for people not to retire
 
01:27:37.250 --> 01:27:37.260 align:start position:0%
immediately and to continue to work
 
01:27:40.129 --> 01:27:40.139 align:start position:0%
because we value all of the
 
01:27:41.870 --> 01:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
contributions and we don't certainly
 
01:27:44.990 --> 01:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to start trying to hire
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
all the high-level policemen in the
 
01:27:49.610 --> 01:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
state at some point you know it's we'd
 
01:27:52.490 --> 01:27:52.500 align:start position:0%
like to stretch it out over a few years
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you for your service guys
 
01:27:56.330 --> 01:27:56.340 align:start position:0%
really do appreciate it all right Steve
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
thank you so much and I'm just going to
 
01:27:58.850 --> 01:27:58.860 align:start position:0%
give the photo Marty for a little bit so
 
01:28:02.390 --> 01:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
and just so everybody out there knows
 
01:28:06.350 --> 01:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
this next section won't have anything to
 
01:28:07.490 --> 01:28:07.500 align:start position:0%
do with the amendment it's more
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
education on how this pension system
 
01:28:11.390 --> 01:28:11.400 align:start position:0%
works so that people can understand it
 
01:28:11.400 --> 01:28:13.810 align:start position:0%
works so that people can understand it
better

01:28:13.810 --> 01:28:13.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.629 --> 01:28:34.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
I'll give give Chris a few minutes
 
01:28:38.510 --> 01:28:38.520 align:start position:0%
should we take a vote right now do you
 
01:28:40.129 --> 01:28:40.139 align:start position:0%
want to take a vote on it right now oh
 
01:28:41.209 --> 01:28:41.219 align:start position:0%
we can't because we don't have that
 
01:28:50.810 --> 01:28:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:50.820 --> 01:28:51.709 align:start position:0%
 
right yeah

01:28:51.709 --> 01:28:51.719 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:54.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:56.629 --> 01:30:56.639 align:start position:0%
um and uh I think I think after another
 
01:30:58.430 --> 01:30:58.440 align:start position:0%
week representative Trill be the pension
 
01:31:03.350 --> 01:31:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
um so so I had sent the full committee a
 
01:31:07.729 --> 01:31:07.739 align:start position:0%
handout uh yesterday in the email you
 
01:31:10.850 --> 01:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
probably yep yes so so
 
01:31:13.430 --> 01:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
yeah so so what that and I think he may
 
01:31:16.010 --> 01:31:16.020 align:start position:0%
have copies if either of you folk gents
 
01:31:17.990 --> 01:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
don't you know okay
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
um so so what I what I try to do here is
 
01:31:25.010 --> 01:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.020 --> 01:31:38.930 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:31:38.930 --> 01:31:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:41.990 --> 01:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
sorry oh oh no problem and I mentioned
 
01:31:43.729 --> 01:31:43.739 align:start position:0%
this to the to the subcommittee chair
 
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
earlier uh you know with respect but
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
actually uh yes Peter uh gentlemen uh we
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
have to continue on with our work uh if
 
01:31:53.209 --> 01:31:53.219 align:start position:0%
you'd like to have conversations that's
 
01:31:54.229 --> 01:31:54.239 align:start position:0%
fine but if you could please take them
 
01:31:57.590 --> 01:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
into the hall for us that would be great
 
01:31:59.570 --> 01:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
um so just just with respect to the
 
01:32:01.010 --> 01:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
committee I mentioned this to the chair
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
earlier but
 
01:32:04.550 --> 01:32:04.560 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually off now and I had made
 
01:32:05.990 --> 01:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
plans in the fall to go out of state
 
01:32:07.729 --> 01:32:07.739 align:start position:0%
this weekend so I kind of have to leave
 
01:32:09.169 --> 01:32:09.179 align:start position:0%
a little bit after that sorry Marty if
 
01:32:10.490 --> 01:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
you suspend for just a gentleman with
 
01:32:12.470 --> 01:32:12.480 align:start position:0%
all due respects so if you if you want
 
01:32:13.930 --> 01:32:13.940 align:start position:0%
to continue talking to me
 
01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
but I can come back next week if needed
 
01:32:19.970 --> 01:32:19.980 align:start position:0%
to to go through things but this this
 
01:32:22.189 --> 01:32:22.199 align:start position:0%
handout that I sent over
 
01:32:24.890 --> 01:32:24.900 align:start position:0%
to the committee yesterday it shows the
 
01:32:27.410 --> 01:32:27.420 align:start position:0%
benefit uh structures the tiers as they
 
01:32:29.030 --> 01:32:29.040 align:start position:0%
exist today
 
01:32:31.910 --> 01:32:31.920 align:start position:0%
um just as a comparing contrast with the
 
01:32:31.920 --> 01:32:32.450 align:start position:0%
um just as a comparing contrast with the
um

01:32:32.450 --> 01:32:32.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:34.250 --> 01:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
you know with the changes to any
 
01:32:36.590 --> 01:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment so just just for the sake of
 
01:32:38.689 --> 01:32:38.699 align:start position:0%
brevity you know we'll say tra members
 
01:32:42.410 --> 01:32:42.420 align:start position:0%
vested prior to 1-1 of 12. uh trb or the
 
01:32:44.810 --> 01:32:44.820 align:start position:0%
folks affected by the amendment today
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
and then TRC this is anyone hired on or
 
01:32:51.470 --> 01:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
after July 1st of 11. nothing changes
 
01:32:52.910 --> 01:32:52.920 align:start position:0%
for them you know in the current
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
Amendment so essentially you know the
 
01:32:58.370 --> 01:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
benefit formula for the tra the old plan
 
01:33:01.129 --> 01:33:01.139 align:start position:0%
folks if you will is the minimum age and
 
01:33:04.729 --> 01:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
service to retire is 45 age 45 with 20
 
01:33:06.350 --> 01:33:06.360 align:start position:0%
years of service you'd have to hit both
 
01:33:07.729 --> 01:33:07.739 align:start position:0%
of those so you could have somebody who
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
doesn't get their 20 until they're 50
 
01:33:10.910 --> 01:33:10.920 align:start position:0%
years old depending on when they start
 
01:33:13.010 --> 01:33:13.020 align:start position:0%
but you have to hit both of those
 
01:33:15.890 --> 01:33:15.900 align:start position:0%
minimums uh this is you know still quite
 
01:33:18.050 --> 01:33:18.060 align:start position:0%
a number of them still active in the
 
01:33:20.689 --> 01:33:20.699 align:start position:0%
system and when they retire that's their
 
01:33:22.729 --> 01:33:22.739 align:start position:0%
average final compensation and I'll talk
 
01:33:25.129 --> 01:33:25.139 align:start position:0%
about how that has changed as well
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
multiplied by two and a half percent
 
01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:30.420 align:start position:0%
multiplied by their service time so the
 
01:33:33.290 --> 01:33:33.300 align:start position:0%
example here for this traum or is it if
 
01:33:35.090 --> 01:33:35.100 align:start position:0%
they had an average final compensation
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
of 80 000 times 0.25 you know is 2 000 a
 
01:33:42.410 --> 01:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
year times 20 years you know working 20
 
01:33:44.270 --> 01:33:44.280 align:start position:0%
years would get them fifty percent of
 
01:33:47.050 --> 01:33:47.060 align:start position:0%
their average final compensation
 
01:33:51.649 --> 01:33:51.659 align:start position:0%
100 exactly yeah yeah just you know and
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
um and now there's an important
 
01:33:56.689 --> 01:33:56.699 align:start position:0%
difference in the examples I I put here
 
01:33:56.699 --> 01:33:57.410 align:start position:0%
difference in the examples I I put here
um

01:33:57.410 --> 01:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:59.930 --> 01:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
you know I used 80 000 as a baseline for
 
01:34:01.850 --> 01:34:01.860 align:start position:0%
comparison say just just for that but
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
the definition of earnable average final
 
01:34:06.050 --> 01:34:06.060 align:start position:0%
compensation as well as earnable
 
01:34:08.030 --> 01:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
compensation are both different for
 
01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:09.840 align:start position:0%
members in tier B and tier C that's
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
those are some of the changes addressed
 
01:34:14.450 --> 01:34:14.460 align:start position:0%
in in representative Pearson's Amendment
 
01:34:16.550 --> 01:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
and those are the things that can't be
 
01:34:18.410 --> 01:34:18.420 align:start position:0%
changed after three years going forward
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
in the amendment but so so basically you
 
01:34:24.050 --> 01:34:24.060 align:start position:0%
know the changes made in 2011 cut out
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
types of pay that count towards the
 
01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
pension and put additional calculations
 
01:34:31.370 --> 01:34:31.380 align:start position:0%
on how much uh money above your base pay
 
01:34:33.709 --> 01:34:33.719 align:start position:0%
that you can receive that counts towards
 
01:34:35.270 --> 01:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
your pension obviously if you earn it
 
01:34:37.250 --> 01:34:37.260 align:start position:0%
you're going to get those dollars some
 
01:34:39.590 --> 01:34:39.600 align:start position:0%
of the big things in that and we could
 
01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
really get into the the microscopic
 
01:34:43.070 --> 01:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
level but some of the big picture things
 
01:34:46.070 --> 01:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
is with earnable compensation is pay for
 
01:34:48.770 --> 01:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
accrued unused sick and vacation time
 
01:34:50.870 --> 01:34:50.880 align:start position:0%
you know depending on the employer and
 
01:34:52.490 --> 01:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
depending how long somebody's there they
 
01:34:54.770 --> 01:34:54.780 align:start position:0%
could have you know 10 20 weeks vacation
 
01:34:56.990 --> 01:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
or you know some some employers pay out
 
01:34:59.930 --> 01:34:59.940 align:start position:0%
for unused sick you either total or on a
 
01:35:01.850 --> 01:35:01.860 align:start position:0%
parata basis so you know it's a nice
 
01:35:03.890 --> 01:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
little chunk you know at the end of your
 
01:35:06.290 --> 01:35:06.300 align:start position:0%
career and for the tra members that's
 
01:35:08.350 --> 01:35:08.360 align:start position:0%
part of the average final compensation
 
01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
piece so it's averaged over three years
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
um so that that goes into their final
 
01:35:16.370 --> 01:35:16.380 align:start position:0%
pension calc for anybody in tier B or C
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
they may get that money from the
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
employer if the contract calls for it
 
01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
but that isn't reported to nhrs and it
 
01:35:25.250 --> 01:35:25.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't factor into their benefit so
 
01:35:27.590 --> 01:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's a big change there's another one
 
01:35:29.750 --> 01:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
with average final compensation called
 
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
comp over base there was a bill last
 
01:35:34.490 --> 01:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
year to address it somewhat for group
 
01:35:36.290 --> 01:35:36.300 align:start position:0%
two tier B
 
01:35:38.270 --> 01:35:38.280 align:start position:0%
um you know there was that the let the
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
state put the money up front to correct
 
01:35:42.890 --> 01:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
that I think it was about 43 million but
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
but you know the big picture thing you
 
01:35:46.850 --> 01:35:46.860 align:start position:0%
want to just think of is a average final
 
01:35:48.890 --> 01:35:48.900 align:start position:0%
compensation and earnable compensation
 
01:35:48.900 --> 01:35:50.209 align:start position:0%
compensation and earnable compensation
changes

01:35:50.209 --> 01:35:50.219 align:start position:0%
changes
 
01:35:52.189 --> 01:35:52.199 align:start position:0%
among the tiers and it basically gets
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
less and less so so when you're doing
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
these these sample calcs the AFC is in
 
01:36:00.070 --> 01:36:00.080 align:start position:0%
apples to apples in some ways so
 
01:36:03.290 --> 01:36:03.300 align:start position:0%
probably going pretty deep there so
 
01:36:05.570 --> 01:36:05.580 align:start position:0%
and then if you turn to page two this is
 
01:36:08.330 --> 01:36:08.340 align:start position:0%
trb this is the folks that this bill
 
01:36:11.570 --> 01:36:11.580 align:start position:0%
addresses the uh 436 addresses with this
 
01:36:14.810 --> 01:36:14.820 align:start position:0%
amendment and when the law was changed
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire chose to retroactively you
 
01:36:19.910 --> 01:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
know change benefits for people who are
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
in the system but not yet vested that's
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
the whole sort of
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:38.390 --> 01:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
like we had a gentleman from Corrections
 
01:36:40.189 --> 01:36:40.199 align:start position:0%
who has since left the room who started
 
01:36:42.590 --> 01:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
in January of o2 so he had nine years
 
01:36:45.770 --> 01:36:45.780 align:start position:0%
and 11 months when the law changed so
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
um so so that you know so so you know so
 
01:36:51.290 --> 01:36:51.300 align:start position:0%
that that's how that worked that and
 
01:36:53.930 --> 01:36:53.940 align:start position:0%
this shows what basically among the
 
01:36:56.090 --> 01:36:56.100 align:start position:0%
other than the compensation calculation
 
01:37:00.169 --> 01:37:00.179 align:start position:0%
changes they added a year of age and an
 
01:37:02.510 --> 01:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
added a year of service to the minimums
 
01:37:05.209 --> 01:37:05.219 align:start position:0%
to retire and also reduce the multiplier
 
01:37:08.030 --> 01:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
on a sliding table so that that person
 
01:37:10.970 --> 01:37:10.980 align:start position:0%
who was hired in 2002 rather than
 
01:37:14.330 --> 01:37:14.340 align:start position:0%
retiring at 45 with 20 years at two and
 
01:37:17.270 --> 01:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
a half percent a year they after retired
 
01:37:20.229 --> 01:37:20.239 align:start position:0%
no no earlier than age 46 with 21 years
 
01:37:23.149 --> 01:37:23.159 align:start position:0%
multipliers you know 0.1 less and it
 
01:37:25.910 --> 01:37:25.920 align:start position:0%
sort of slides down so the sample count
 
01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
on this page just show those right now
 
01:37:30.649 --> 01:37:30.659 align:start position:0%
there's four levels in this table the
 
01:37:32.149 --> 01:37:32.159 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson's moving it to
 
01:37:34.850 --> 01:37:34.860 align:start position:0%
nine levels but you know the calcs there
 
01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:37.320 align:start position:0%
so essentially even
 
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
keeping the flat AFC you know the
 
01:37:43.370 --> 01:37:43.380 align:start position:0%
pension benefits are set of forty
 
01:37:44.870 --> 01:37:44.880 align:start position:0%
thousand there forty thousand three
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
hundred forty thousand four eighty so so
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
you're working another year two three or
 
01:37:50.570 --> 01:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
four basically to get the same benefit
 
01:37:52.910 --> 01:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
that a tra member gets if they retired
 
01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
at 45 with 20. so so that that's how the
 
01:37:56.280 --> 01:37:57.110 align:start position:0%
at 45 with 20. so so that that's how the
current

01:37:57.110 --> 01:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
current
 
01:38:01.430 --> 01:38:01.440 align:start position:0%
structure is works and and um
 
01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
you know in what this bill would do is
 
01:38:07.010 --> 01:38:07.020 align:start position:0%
on a year by year basis phase the people
 
01:38:10.129 --> 01:38:10.139 align:start position:0%
who are into your beer tier B back into
 
01:38:12.649 --> 01:38:12.659 align:start position:0%
tier a so that
 
01:38:16.189 --> 01:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
um that person who started in 2002
 
01:38:18.530 --> 01:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
um if the bill passes as of next January
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
1st 24 his his new minimum age and
 
01:38:23.810 --> 01:38:23.820 align:start position:0%
Service retirement requirement for
 
01:38:26.209 --> 01:38:26.219 align:start position:0%
retirement would have been 45 and 20 his
 
01:38:28.189 --> 01:38:28.199 align:start position:0%
multiplier for his career would be 2.5
 
01:38:31.129 --> 01:38:31.139 align:start position:0%
instead of 2.4 and those end of career
 
01:38:34.669 --> 01:38:34.679 align:start position:0%
payouts and you know uh you know uh
 
01:38:37.070 --> 01:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
calculations that camp down the average
 
01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
final compensation go away and he's
 
01:38:42.590 --> 01:38:42.600 align:start position:0%
retiring basically under the old plan
 
01:38:45.290 --> 01:38:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay and and that and that every year
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
you know one more one more group of
 
01:38:49.430 --> 01:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
people who were hired in that calendar
 
01:38:49.440 --> 01:38:50.689 align:start position:0%
people who were hired in that calendar
year

01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:38:54.050 --> 01:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
become eligible to retire under tra so
 
01:38:56.149 --> 01:38:56.159 align:start position:0%
instead of doing it all at once so
 
01:38:59.330 --> 01:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
everybody who is you know hired between
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
2002 and July 1st of 11 could go out at
 
01:39:05.030 --> 01:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
45 and 20 as soon as they hit it they
 
01:39:07.910 --> 01:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
have to work a little bit longer I I was
 
01:39:10.250 --> 01:39:10.260 align:start position:0%
talking to representative Pearson
 
01:39:12.830 --> 01:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
just before he had to leave because I
 
01:39:15.229 --> 01:39:15.239 align:start position:0%
had an email and a phone call from
 
01:39:17.689 --> 01:39:17.699 align:start position:0%
representative Abeer this morning she
 
01:39:19.250 --> 01:39:19.260 align:start position:0%
had a question about well how many years
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
do people have to work and that came up
 
01:39:23.930 --> 01:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
earlier in the conversation so so the
 
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
way the changes are phased in if you
 
01:39:28.729 --> 01:39:28.739 align:start position:0%
were hired in 2002 so you're right at
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
the you know the nine years plus in trb
 
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:33.659 align:start position:0%
right now you miss investing by that
 
01:39:33.659 --> 01:39:35.030 align:start position:0%
right now you miss investing by that
much

01:39:35.030 --> 01:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
much
 
01:39:37.250 --> 01:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
um next year the vested by date would
 
01:39:40.550 --> 01:39:40.560 align:start position:0%
change to 1 1 of 13. okay and that's
 
01:39:43.189 --> 01:39:43.199 align:start position:0%
effective on January 1st of 24. so
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
somebody hired in 20 2002
 
01:39:49.070 --> 01:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
would have had has to work you know 22
 
01:39:51.890 --> 01:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
between 21 and 22 21 point something in
 
01:39:54.410 --> 01:39:54.420 align:start position:0%
22 years to retire so they have to
 
01:39:57.770 --> 01:39:57.780 align:start position:0%
hang around longer you know uh by a year
 
01:40:00.410 --> 01:40:00.420 align:start position:0%
then as representative Pearson indicated
 
01:40:03.169 --> 01:40:03.179 align:start position:0%
earlier and
 
01:40:04.430 --> 01:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
so so the phasing in here creates a de
 
01:40:11.450 --> 01:40:11.460 align:start position:0%
facto you know 22 years of service is a
 
01:40:13.550 --> 01:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
minimum for everybody because the way
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
the way the timing of the bill is
 
01:40:17.870 --> 01:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
you know and I I say 22 in round numbers
 
01:40:19.490 --> 01:40:19.500 align:start position:0%
but it depends on what when in the year
 
01:40:21.950 --> 01:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
you started but so
 
01:40:24.770 --> 01:40:24.780 align:start position:0%
um and so the the this is where it gets
 
01:40:25.970 --> 01:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
a little complicated and this is why I
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
just want to check with him first so you
 
01:40:31.070 --> 01:40:31.080 align:start position:0%
know the folks hired in 2002 and 2003 so
 
01:40:33.290 --> 01:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
they had less than 10 but more than
 
01:40:36.290 --> 01:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
eight years when the law changed
 
01:40:39.290 --> 01:40:39.300 align:start position:0%
um you know they can retire at 21 years
 
01:40:42.110 --> 01:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
so literally yeah some of that
 
01:40:44.209 --> 01:40:44.219 align:start position:0%
um hypothetical gentleman I I cited can
 
01:40:46.250 --> 01:40:46.260 align:start position:0%
we could have retired February 1st under
 
01:40:47.930 --> 01:40:47.940 align:start position:0%
the current Provisions had he chose so
 
01:40:48.890 --> 01:40:48.900 align:start position:0%
he's going to have to wait till next
 
01:40:51.770 --> 01:40:51.780 align:start position:0%
year if this goes through to get the the
 
01:40:54.290 --> 01:40:54.300 align:start position:0%
different benefit count and then the
 
01:40:57.470 --> 01:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
next uh transfer of people were those
 
01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:58.790 align:start position:0%
next uh transfer of people were those
hired

01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:58.800 align:start position:0%
hired
 
01:40:59.810 --> 01:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
um with
 
01:41:01.250 --> 01:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
um less than eight but more than six
 
01:41:03.830 --> 01:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
years and that's 47 and 22 for those
 
01:41:05.450 --> 01:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
people so they still have to work 22
 
01:41:05.460 --> 01:41:06.350 align:start position:0%
people so they still have to work 22
years

01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
to get it and then so every everybody in
 
01:41:11.090 --> 01:41:11.100 align:start position:0%
this in the tears right now is going to
 
01:41:12.830 --> 01:41:12.840 align:start position:0%
have to work 22 years before they can
 
01:41:16.610 --> 01:41:16.620 align:start position:0%
retire and that's two years more than
 
01:41:18.890 --> 01:41:18.900 align:start position:0%
what the law said when they were hired
 
01:41:20.930 --> 01:41:20.940 align:start position:0%
it was 20 years when they for these
 
01:41:23.209 --> 01:41:23.219 align:start position:0%
people you know the law changed and the
 
01:41:24.709 --> 01:41:24.719 align:start position:0%
people on the tail end of this have to
 
01:41:27.830 --> 01:41:27.840 align:start position:0%
work 23 or 24 years to be eligible it
 
01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:30.360 align:start position:0%
reverts back to 22 for them but it's
 
01:41:32.149 --> 01:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
it's still
 
01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
more year they still have to work more
 
01:41:36.109 --> 01:41:36.119 align:start position:0%
years than they would have had the plan
 
01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
never changed you know back in 2011 so
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
that it's
 
01:41:42.169 --> 01:41:42.179 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a it's a complicated concept I
 
01:41:44.030 --> 01:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
mean you know so it's it's essentially
 
01:41:46.609 --> 01:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
moving year by year group you know a
 
01:41:49.490 --> 01:41:49.500 align:start position:0%
couple hundred people back into tra
 
01:41:52.729 --> 01:41:52.739 align:start position:0%
um you know over over a 10-year period
 
01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
so that is the most complicated thing I
 
01:41:57.410 --> 01:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
had to tell you so um I'm sure you may
 
01:41:59.209 --> 01:41:59.219 align:start position:0%
have some questions and and if you got
 
01:42:01.129 --> 01:42:01.139 align:start position:0%
that I'm going to give you an apple and
 
01:42:06.950 --> 01:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:06.960 --> 01:42:08.270 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:42:08.270 --> 01:42:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:10.850 --> 01:42:10.860 align:start position:0%
is any of this affect people who are
 
01:42:13.430 --> 01:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
retired now no
 
01:42:13.440 --> 01:42:14.209 align:start position:0%
retired now no
no

01:42:14.209 --> 01:42:14.219 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:42:14.219 --> 01:42:16.609 align:start position:0%
no
um

01:42:16.609 --> 01:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:19.010 --> 01:42:19.020 align:start position:0%
is this 200 million dollars whatever
 
01:42:22.310 --> 01:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
number that's going to figure out to be
 
01:42:25.910 --> 01:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
is is that only for basically for the
 
01:42:27.229 --> 01:42:27.239 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:42:31.010 --> 01:42:31.020 align:start position:0%
to help pay for the Tia be
 
01:42:32.870 --> 01:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yes
 
01:42:38.330 --> 01:42:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:42.410 --> 01:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
it's 250 million dollars for 1700 people
 
01:42:42.420 --> 01:42:46.090 align:start position:0%
it's 250 million dollars for 1700 people
foreign

01:42:46.090 --> 01:42:46.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:48.890 --> 01:42:48.900 align:start position:0%
population in the in the tier B so yeah
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
that yeah
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
and peer
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
keeps getting smaller
 
01:43:03.050 --> 01:43:03.060 align:start position:0%
right because the people move out of
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
the the this is based on basically when
 
01:43:08.629 --> 01:43:08.639 align:start position:0%
how many years of service they had at
 
01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2012. so so it's a fixed
 
01:43:14.570 --> 01:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
population I can't get any bigger you
 
01:43:16.070 --> 01:43:16.080 align:start position:0%
know when people retire or pass away
 
01:43:17.629 --> 01:43:17.639 align:start position:0%
that's the only way it can get smaller
 
01:43:19.550 --> 01:43:19.560 align:start position:0%
or if they quit before they've you know
 
01:43:21.590 --> 01:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
before they're eligible to collect a
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
pension and come back later and get it
 
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
you know those you know people and
 
01:43:26.450 --> 01:43:26.460 align:start position:0%
because it is a pension where we're
 
01:43:28.729 --> 01:43:28.739 align:start position:0%
estimating value per person over
 
01:43:28.739 --> 01:43:30.109 align:start position:0%
estimating value per person over
potentially

01:43:30.109 --> 01:43:30.119 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
01:43:33.169 --> 01:43:33.179 align:start position:0%
20 years 30 years 40 years so each
 
01:43:35.870 --> 01:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
individual year is you know obviously
 
01:43:38.090 --> 01:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
not nearly as much but if somebody lives
 
01:43:39.649 --> 01:43:39.659 align:start position:0%
40 years then that benefit that
 
01:43:41.149 --> 01:43:41.159 align:start position:0%
additional benefit is quite a bit of
 
01:43:41.159 --> 01:43:42.350 align:start position:0%
additional benefit is quite a bit of
money

01:43:42.350 --> 01:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:43:44.750 --> 01:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
um from from a pension standpoint
 
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
I'm going to guess that you in school
 
01:43:49.070 --> 01:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
you probably were pretty good in math
 
01:43:52.189 --> 01:43:52.199 align:start position:0%
other than geometry I'm taking a stab at
 
01:43:54.830 --> 01:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
this that was painful if uh if it were
 
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
up to me no there'd be something a
 
01:43:59.930 --> 01:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
little extra in your paycheck next week
 
01:44:04.430 --> 01:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
sadly sadly it's not up to me thank you
 
01:44:06.169 --> 01:44:06.179 align:start position:0%
thank you very much if this is in
 
01:44:07.970 --> 01:44:07.980 align:start position:0%
YouTube I'll show this to my boss next
 
01:44:07.980 --> 01:44:09.950 align:start position:0%
YouTube I'll show this to my boss next
week

01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
week
 
01:44:11.209 --> 01:44:11.219 align:start position:0%
um so so
 
01:44:13.970 --> 01:44:13.980 align:start position:0%
um yeah that thank you
 
01:44:20.750 --> 01:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:22.609 --> 01:44:22.619 align:start position:0%
it used to be
 
01:44:22.619 --> 01:44:24.169 align:start position:0%
it used to be
um

01:44:24.169 --> 01:44:24.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:26.629 --> 01:44:26.639 align:start position:0%
up on all these things
 
01:44:28.729 --> 01:44:28.739 align:start position:0%
but when uh
 
01:44:32.350 --> 01:44:32.360 align:start position:0%
representative speaker O'Brien
 
01:44:34.790 --> 01:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
took the
 
01:44:37.010 --> 01:44:37.020 align:start position:0%
you know the retirement system away from
 
01:44:39.169 --> 01:44:39.179 align:start position:0%
me DNA and put it in the special
 
01:44:42.490 --> 01:44:42.500 align:start position:0%
committee and that was two years of
 
01:44:45.890 --> 01:44:45.900 align:start position:0%
avoid when I was not hearing about this
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
all the time so even though I have even
 
01:44:53.709 --> 01:44:53.719 align:start position:0%
though I do recall the situation where
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
suddenly reshuffled the deck on that
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
group of people who were
 
01:45:01.790 --> 01:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
more than nine years but not quite 10
 
01:45:01.800 --> 01:45:03.950 align:start position:0%
more than nine years but not quite 10
years

01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
and and so forth and they really did get
 
01:45:09.530 --> 01:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
the reluctable dog from underneath them
 
01:45:11.870 --> 01:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
but suddenly they were going to have to
 
01:45:14.209 --> 01:45:14.219 align:start position:0%
work an extra year or so
 
01:45:17.209 --> 01:45:17.219 align:start position:0%
for the same amount of money
 
01:45:19.970 --> 01:45:19.980 align:start position:0%
and that delayed their return their
 
01:45:22.609 --> 01:45:22.619 align:start position:0%
ability to re-retire with with the
 
01:45:26.270 --> 01:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
benefits uh that they promised
 
01:45:29.750 --> 01:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
the extra year basically what was maybe
 
01:45:32.090 --> 01:45:32.100 align:start position:0%
even a little bit more kind of for free
 
01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:35.209 align:start position:0%
even a little bit more kind of for free
right

01:45:35.209 --> 01:45:35.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:38.510 --> 01:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
I I do recall being across the hall
 
01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:39.890 align:start position:0%
I I do recall being across the hall
and

01:45:39.890 --> 01:45:39.900 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:45:42.770 --> 01:45:42.780 align:start position:0%
we were sitting up here and there were
 
01:45:44.890 --> 01:45:44.900 align:start position:0%
you there Marty
 
01:45:48.890 --> 01:45:48.900 align:start position:0%
oh the back of the room was full of
 
01:45:52.790 --> 01:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:55.410 --> 01:45:55.420 align:start position:0%
you guys were 30 years
 
01:45:55.420 --> 01:45:57.649 align:start position:0%
you guys were 30 years
[Laughter]

01:45:57.649 --> 01:45:57.659 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
01:46:01.430 --> 01:46:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:03.950 --> 01:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
to clarify though Peter
 
01:46:06.890 --> 01:46:06.900 align:start position:0%
they were still employees but to clarify
 
01:46:09.830 --> 01:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
this because this is important when we
 
01:46:12.169 --> 01:46:12.179 align:start position:0%
say they had to work another year for
 
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
the same amount of money some people
 
01:46:15.350 --> 01:46:15.360 align:start position:0%
might throw up their hands and say so
 
01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:16.129 align:start position:0%
might throw up their hands and say so
what

01:46:16.129 --> 01:46:16.139 align:start position:0%
what
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
they still had to pay into the system
 
01:46:20.450 --> 01:46:20.460 align:start position:0%
for an additional year so money is being
 
01:46:22.490 --> 01:46:22.500 align:start position:0%
taken out of their paycheck for that
 
01:46:24.649 --> 01:46:24.659 align:start position:0%
extra year in order for them to get the
 
01:46:26.030 --> 01:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
benefit it's not just like how we're
 
01:46:27.410 --> 01:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
just going to delay it for a year and
 
01:46:28.729 --> 01:46:28.739 align:start position:0%
then you can get the same benefit you
 
01:46:30.290 --> 01:46:30.300 align:start position:0%
were going to get if that had been the
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
case people probably would have rolled
 
01:46:32.810 --> 01:46:32.820 align:start position:0%
their eyes a little bit like whatever
 
01:46:34.669 --> 01:46:34.679 align:start position:0%
but some of these other guys had to work
 
01:46:36.530 --> 01:46:36.540 align:start position:0%
an extra two years three years four
 
01:46:39.649 --> 01:46:39.659 align:start position:0%
years paying into the system having
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
money taken out of their paycheck to get
 
01:46:43.370 --> 01:46:43.380 align:start position:0%
that benefit so that that can be
 
01:46:44.330 --> 01:46:44.340 align:start position:0%
confused when you're looking at this
 
01:46:46.850 --> 01:46:46.860 align:start position:0%
chart because you're like well so if
 
01:46:49.669 --> 01:46:49.679 align:start position:0%
they were in tra and they made 80 000 on
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
average then they're going to get a 40
 
01:46:53.810 --> 01:46:53.820 align:start position:0%
000 but a year they have to work an
 
01:46:55.609 --> 01:46:55.619 align:start position:0%
extra year and they get an extra 320
 
01:46:57.410 --> 01:46:57.420 align:start position:0%
bucks so what's the big deal well you
 
01:46:59.570 --> 01:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
know that 12 or 13 000 that they had to
 
01:47:01.609 --> 01:47:01.619 align:start position:0%
pay in to get there is a big deal if you
 
01:47:02.890 --> 01:47:02.900 align:start position:0%
go down to the next one well that other
 
01:47:04.850 --> 01:47:04.860 align:start position:0%
twenty four thousand dollars that they
 
01:47:07.430 --> 01:47:07.440 align:start position:0%
had to pay in to get that is there you
 
01:47:09.590 --> 01:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
know like so it's it just compounds as
 
01:47:12.590 --> 01:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
it goes along right well there were a
 
01:47:14.990 --> 01:47:15.000 align:start position:0%
lot of guys who were
 
01:47:16.910 --> 01:47:16.920 align:start position:0%
they had a very Gloom look on their
 
01:47:20.090 --> 01:47:20.100 align:start position:0%
faces and I remember Steve Pearson
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
sitting there and so I do remember his
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
friends a lot of unhappiness
 
01:47:29.149 --> 01:47:29.159 align:start position:0%
uh and so this
 
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
this new plan uh restores some
 
01:47:35.450 --> 01:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
activities of people
 
01:47:41.290 --> 01:47:41.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:44.149 --> 01:47:44.159 align:start position:0%
at least there was some Equity to those
 
01:47:46.189 --> 01:47:46.199 align:start position:0%
people so it's it's the right thing to
 
01:47:48.470 --> 01:47:48.480 align:start position:0%
do it's not a full
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
that's important for the following us
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
be made conscious of uh and you remain
 
01:47:59.930 --> 01:47:59.940 align:start position:0%
conscious of that restores some of the
 
01:48:03.470 --> 01:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
lost you know Equity but not all but
 
01:48:12.590 --> 01:48:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.270 --> 01:48:14.280 align:start position:0%
it's also a common story about the
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
people who have been sort of that they
 
01:48:20.450 --> 01:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
are willing to compromise and come to
 
01:48:22.310 --> 01:48:22.320 align:start position:0%
the table and not demand whatever I
 
01:48:23.689 --> 01:48:23.699 align:start position:0%
think they're willing to get this model
 
01:48:25.850 --> 01:48:25.860 align:start position:0%
State and uh in this particular
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
situation highly of their their
 
01:48:30.890 --> 01:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
integrity so
 
01:48:38.810 --> 01:48:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:41.270 --> 01:48:41.280 align:start position:0%
email me to remind me to send you one
 
01:48:42.970 --> 01:48:42.980 align:start position:0%
well I mean
 
01:48:47.390 --> 01:48:47.400 align:start position:0%
the legislature you know made a mistake
 
01:48:50.689 --> 01:48:50.699 align:start position:0%
a long time ago in leaving a system in
 
01:48:50.699 --> 01:48:52.189 align:start position:0%
a long time ago in leaving a system in
place

01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
place
 
01:48:54.290 --> 01:48:54.300 align:start position:0%
uh that was only supposed to be there
 
01:48:55.850 --> 01:48:55.860 align:start position:0%
for a very short
 
01:48:59.209 --> 01:48:59.219 align:start position:0%
period of time to give some relief to
 
01:49:01.729 --> 01:49:01.739 align:start position:0%
the to the employers to the to the towns
 
01:49:04.490 --> 01:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
and so forth and that got left in place
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
and it did a lot of damage to the system
 
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
to the point where I was reading
 
01:49:15.709 --> 01:49:15.719 align:start position:0%
stop for 15 000 in 2007 actually but
 
01:49:22.870 --> 01:49:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
in the 90s
 
01:49:27.169 --> 01:49:27.179 align:start position:0%
yeah it was it was a temporary solution
 
01:49:29.270 --> 01:49:29.280 align:start position:0%
and acted in 91 that stayed on the book
 
01:49:35.470 --> 01:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:39.530 --> 01:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
during that time oh yeah I remember
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
seeing the chart and the challenge of
 
01:49:44.570 --> 01:49:44.580 align:start position:0%
paying like 1.3 and that's how we ended
 
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
up are we still in committee
 
01:49:49.070 --> 01:49:49.080 align:start position:0%
that's it should we be turning on the
 
01:49:49.080 --> 01:49:50.629 align:start position:0%
that's it should we be turning on the
mics

01:49:50.629 --> 01:49:50.639 align:start position:0%
mics
 
01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
not official but we can all right yeah
 
01:49:54.709 --> 01:49:54.719 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't know I mean at this point I
 
01:49:55.790 --> 01:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
don't know that it really matters I can
 
01:49:57.109 --> 01:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
though um
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
yeah but so we're not just looking at an
 
01:50:01.669 --> 01:50:01.679 align:start position:0%
issue from 2011 this issue
 
01:50:03.350 --> 01:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
the the reason why they did what they
 
01:50:05.209 --> 01:50:05.219 align:start position:0%
did in 2011 is because of what the
 
01:50:07.070 --> 01:50:07.080 align:start position:0%
legislature did from the 90s to the
 
01:50:09.590 --> 01:50:09.600 align:start position:0%
early 2000s and and that's why we have
 
01:50:11.810 --> 01:50:11.820 align:start position:0%
the uaal because the municipalities
 
01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
weren't paying enough money so we
 
01:50:14.450 --> 01:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
weren't getting the return on the money
 
01:50:16.250 --> 01:50:16.260 align:start position:0%
that was supposed to be going in which
 
01:50:17.750 --> 01:50:17.760 align:start position:0%
is why I mean I don't know what to get
 
01:50:19.970 --> 01:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
up to its peak it was almost 11 billion
 
01:50:22.790 --> 01:50:22.800 align:start position:0%
or 9 billion yeah the unfunded liability
 
01:50:25.129 --> 01:50:25.139 align:start position:0%
we topped off a little just just north
 
01:50:26.410 --> 01:50:26.420 align:start position:0%
of six
 
01:50:29.990 --> 01:50:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's like 5.7 a little bit under 5.7 now
 
01:50:33.109 --> 01:50:33.119 align:start position:0%
yeah and if I'll put on my my uh fence
 
01:50:35.209 --> 01:50:35.219 align:start position:0%
straddling retirement system hat to sort
 
01:50:36.590 --> 01:50:36.600 align:start position:0%
of sum up
 
01:50:38.090 --> 01:50:38.100 align:start position:0%
um 2011
 
01:50:39.709 --> 01:50:39.719 align:start position:0%
um you know you know it's it's like I I
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
think it's fair to say that legislative
 
01:50:45.530 --> 01:50:45.540 align:start position:0%
enactments in 2011 were a reaction to
 
01:50:47.990 --> 01:50:48.000 align:start position:0%
some of the funding mishaps in the 90s
 
01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:50.520 align:start position:0%
plus the Great Recession whether they
 
01:50:52.669 --> 01:50:52.679 align:start position:0%
went too far or not far enough is not
 
01:50:54.649 --> 01:50:54.659 align:start position:0%
you know that that's people can have
 
01:50:56.689 --> 01:50:56.699 align:start position:0%
their own opinion on it but I think the
 
01:51:00.050 --> 01:51:00.060 align:start position:0%
reasoning behind that was of sins of the
 
01:51:02.510 --> 01:51:02.520 align:start position:0%
past and they were trying to catch up
 
01:51:04.729 --> 01:51:04.739 align:start position:0%
and and whether that was too extreme or
 
01:51:06.350 --> 01:51:06.360 align:start position:0%
not you know you'll hear different
 
01:51:07.790 --> 01:51:07.800 align:start position:0%
arguments from different people but I
 
01:51:09.229 --> 01:51:09.239 align:start position:0%
think everybody who was here earlier
 
01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
will tell you it went too far yeah well
 
01:51:13.669 --> 01:51:13.679 align:start position:0%
I mean it was
 
01:51:17.990 --> 01:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
until uh until it was recognized what
 
01:51:20.510 --> 01:51:20.520 align:start position:0%
the situation was because we were told
 
01:51:25.129 --> 01:51:25.139 align:start position:0%
that we were 125 funded back in the days
 
01:51:28.490 --> 01:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
under the this temp so-called temporary
 
01:51:30.709 --> 01:51:30.719 align:start position:0%
situation it's only supposed to be there
 
01:51:33.070 --> 01:51:33.080 align:start position:0%
for a couple of years got left in place
 
01:51:36.649 --> 01:51:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh and we were told we were 125 funded
 
01:51:39.470 --> 01:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
and so we said oh great I wasn't here at
 
01:51:41.870 --> 01:51:41.880 align:start position:0%
that time but but that's that's where
 
01:51:45.649 --> 01:51:45.659 align:start position:0%
that was it was explained to us uh and
 
01:51:48.649 --> 01:51:48.659 align:start position:0%
uh so we created special account
 
01:51:52.270 --> 01:51:52.280 align:start position:0%
we as a source of funding for college
 
01:51:57.950 --> 01:51:57.960 align:start position:0%
but also to pay for uh to subsidize a
 
01:52:01.209 --> 01:52:01.219 align:start position:0%
health care plan that was in place
 
01:52:03.770 --> 01:52:03.780 align:start position:0%
and suddenly when it was realized we
 
01:52:07.430 --> 01:52:07.440 align:start position:0%
weren't a 25 funding uh and we were
 
01:52:10.310 --> 01:52:10.320 align:start position:0%
going over the cliff and we had to turn
 
01:52:12.830 --> 01:52:12.840 align:start position:0%
everything around to save the system for
 
01:52:14.930 --> 01:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
everybody yeah we had to absorb those
 
01:52:17.330 --> 01:52:17.340 align:start position:0%
other accounts yeah Chris I know you
 
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
have to go so I just want to give you
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
like a little softball that I thought 2
 
01:52:24.950 --> 01:52:24.960 align:start position:0%
30 2 30 this morning
 
01:52:26.990 --> 01:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
all right so we've got a I'm just
 
01:52:28.310 --> 01:52:28.320 align:start position:0%
throwing out numbers I don't care how
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
accurate they are five billion unfunded
 
01:52:33.950 --> 01:52:33.960 align:start position:0%
liability you're gonna pay off uh 10
 
01:52:36.410 --> 01:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
years after I'm no longer here
 
01:52:38.689 --> 01:52:38.699 align:start position:0%
um but how are you going to do that
 
01:52:40.490 --> 01:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
because you can't
 
01:52:43.729 --> 01:52:43.739 align:start position:0%
whiz how are you coming up with five
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
billion is is that on the backs of the
 
01:52:49.910 --> 01:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
employers now yeah yes the employers
 
01:52:52.430 --> 01:52:52.440 align:start position:0%
pay the full responsibility for funding
 
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
the liability the way the plan is set up
 
01:52:54.300 --> 01:52:55.490 align:start position:0%
the liability the way the plan is set up
so

01:52:55.490 --> 01:52:55.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:52:56.750 --> 01:52:56.760 align:start position:0%
um a couple weeks ago we did our
 
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
orientation the the of the percentage
 
01:53:01.669 --> 01:53:01.679 align:start position:0%
the employers are paying I think it's
 
01:53:04.129 --> 01:53:04.139 align:start position:0%
about 14 for employees a little bit
 
01:53:07.669 --> 01:53:07.679 align:start position:0%
under 20 for teachers and 27 28 for for
 
01:53:09.550 --> 01:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
police and fire
 
01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:13.500 align:start position:0%
75 to 85 percent of that
 
01:53:15.530 --> 01:53:15.540 align:start position:0%
employer rate is paying down the
 
01:53:18.590 --> 01:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
unfunded so so basically the the we're
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
capturing you know you're paying it's
 
01:53:21.950 --> 01:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
basically think of it as an interest
 
01:53:24.410 --> 01:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
payment you know that they're and it's
 
01:53:26.090 --> 01:53:26.100 align:start position:0%
it's part of the rates it's going to be
 
01:53:29.689 --> 01:53:29.699 align:start position:0%
high through 2039 when most of the
 
01:53:32.030 --> 01:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
unfunded is going to be paid down uh
 
01:53:33.530 --> 01:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
there's sort of a safety valve for
 
01:53:35.450 --> 01:53:35.460 align:start position:0%
future gains and losses so we may you
 
01:53:36.709 --> 01:53:36.719 align:start position:0%
know it's
 
01:53:39.050 --> 01:53:39.060 align:start position:0%
you know if a plan was at a hundred
 
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
percent funded at you know 11 52 you
 
01:53:45.169 --> 01:53:45.179 align:start position:0%
know on February 10th you know it could
 
01:53:46.729 --> 01:53:46.739 align:start position:0%
be underfunded in a minute depending on
 
01:53:48.709 --> 01:53:48.719 align:start position:0%
how the market goes or over funded so
 
01:53:50.570 --> 01:53:50.580 align:start position:0%
you know you want to be close to 100
 
01:53:52.430 --> 01:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
because that you have a lot more
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
flexibility with benefit construction
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
too because you're not accruing
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
liabilities if you change things and the
 
01:53:59.090 --> 01:53:59.100 align:start position:0%
rates are going to be lower
 
01:54:02.030 --> 01:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
um but um you know we're we're
 
01:54:04.790 --> 01:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
the the rates are a percentage of
 
01:54:07.070 --> 01:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
payroll so as salaries increase just you
 
01:54:08.570 --> 01:54:08.580 align:start position:0%
know you know through inflation or
 
01:54:11.390 --> 01:54:11.400 align:start position:0%
contract increases employers are paying
 
01:54:13.129 --> 01:54:13.139 align:start position:0%
that same unfunded rate for another
 
01:54:17.149 --> 01:54:17.159 align:start position:0%
through 2039 you know and that's gonna
 
01:54:19.310 --> 01:54:19.320 align:start position:0%
every year money's coming in it's being
 
01:54:21.410 --> 01:54:21.420 align:start position:0%
invested so we're hopefully earning
 
01:54:23.390 --> 01:54:23.400 align:start position:0%
interest on that on a long-term basis
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
that's how we're going to get to the 5
 
01:54:27.590 --> 01:54:27.600 align:start position:0%
billion you know to pay that down so
 
01:54:29.090 --> 01:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
that that's that's
 
01:54:31.250 --> 01:54:31.260 align:start position:0%
oh worry I turned I turned the softball
 
01:54:33.709 --> 01:54:33.719 align:start position:0%
into like a you know a 3-2 you know one
 
01:54:35.330 --> 01:54:35.340 align:start position:0%
account before before I took the lock
 
01:54:38.209 --> 01:54:38.219 align:start position:0%
but uh so yes the municipalities pay it
 
01:54:39.890 --> 01:54:39.900 align:start position:0%
yeah and then and it's either the
 
01:54:41.810 --> 01:54:41.820 align:start position:0%
employer yeah and if the the rates of
 
01:54:44.270 --> 01:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
Investments don't don't meet what we are
 
01:54:45.830 --> 01:54:45.840 align:start position:0%
expecting them to meet then the rates
 
01:54:47.510 --> 01:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
for the municipalities will go up at
 
01:54:50.870 --> 01:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
some point to compensate and vice versa
 
01:54:52.729 --> 01:54:52.739 align:start position:0%
so if we over perform right now then the
 
01:54:55.250 --> 01:54:55.260 align:start position:0%
rates should go down a little bit but
 
01:54:58.729 --> 01:54:58.739 align:start position:0%
um until 2039 when the uaal is at
 
01:55:01.250 --> 01:55:01.260 align:start position:0%
arguably 100 funded and then the rates
 
01:55:02.570 --> 01:55:02.580 align:start position:0%
for the municipality should drop
 
01:55:04.430 --> 01:55:04.440 align:start position:0%
straight through the floor that's the
 
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
goal I'll be sure I'll be looking down
 
01:55:10.370 --> 01:55:10.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:12.229 --> 01:55:12.239 align:start position:0%
I was there I was
 
01:55:14.570 --> 01:55:14.580 align:start position:0%
I was oh really JC I was there
 
01:55:14.580 --> 01:55:15.590 align:start position:0%
I was oh really JC I was there
um

01:55:15.590 --> 01:55:15.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
on the original bill it talked about
 
01:55:20.149 --> 01:55:20.159 align:start position:0%
teachers this has nothing to do this has
 
01:55:21.350 --> 01:55:21.360 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with teachers just group
 
01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:22.070 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with teachers just group
two

01:55:22.070 --> 01:55:22.080 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:55:23.870 --> 01:55:23.880 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's some of the stuff
 
01:55:23.880 --> 01:55:25.609 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's some of the stuff
that's

01:55:25.609 --> 01:55:25.619 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:55:28.129 --> 01:55:28.139 align:start position:0%
we're gonna not see teachers in the
 
01:55:30.229 --> 01:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
amendment right correct yeah yeah and
 
01:55:32.270 --> 01:55:32.280 align:start position:0%
and that went both ways um there were
 
01:55:34.189 --> 01:55:34.199 align:start position:0%
some group one language and group two
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
areas and some group two languages of
 
01:55:38.149 --> 01:55:38.159 align:start position:0%
group one area so um those have been
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
caught though we're gonna get rid of
 
01:55:41.390 --> 01:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
that stuff so we will have to meet again
 
01:55:44.149 --> 01:55:44.159 align:start position:0%
probably before
 
01:55:46.430 --> 01:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
um committee work next Wednesday because
 
01:55:49.189 --> 01:55:49.199 align:start position:0%
we'll have the final Amendment at that
 
01:55:49.199 --> 01:55:50.270 align:start position:0%

line by line myself and then we'll vote
 
01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
