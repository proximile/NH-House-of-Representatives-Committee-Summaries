00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
all right good morning welcome to
 
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
Edna today is pension bills number one
 
00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 align:start position:0%
all of these bills will be going to
 
00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 align:start position:0%
subcommittee unless something
 
00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 align:start position:0%
extraordinary happens and so M
 
00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 align:start position:0%
representative Simon will be leading the
 
00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 align:start position:0%
sub Comm committee and that's where all
 
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 align:start position:0%
the details will be beaten
 
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.910 align:start position:0%
the details will be beaten
out

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 align:start position:0%
uh recognize to of the sponsors
 
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 align:start position:0%
representative lean and representative
 
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 align:start position:0%
Maguire thank you madam chair and I'm
 
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 align:start position:0%
glad to have representative Dan Maguire
 
00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 align:start position:0%
sitting to my left uh we often joke in
 
00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 align:start position:0%
finance that he's our professor and goto
 
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
guy with retirement issues so it's good
 
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 align:start position:0%
to have him there but I think that has
 
00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
something to do with who he commutes
 
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 align:start position:0%
with to conquer it for perhaps but I do
 
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 align:start position:0%
have a couple of handouts uh one is the
 
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 align:start position:0%
report of the retirement
 
00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 align:start position:0%
commission uh and also the LBA did a
 
00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 align:start position:0%
nice comparison there's been some
 
00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 align:start position:0%
discussion about what you had here last
 
00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:45.869 align:start position:0%
discussion about what you had here last
year

00:02:45.869 --> 00:02:45.879 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 align:start position:0%
436 and so I have a comparison between
 
00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
what this bill does and um okay thanks
 
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 align:start position:0%
Dan excellent those are those are very
 
00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 align:start position:0%
useful items and I'm sure we will study
 
00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.470 align:start position:0%
useful items and I'm sure we will study
them

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 align:start position:0%
well I wrote the report so I know about
 
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
right you also have a document there
 
00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
from Marty Carlin from the retirement
 
00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
system I I think it's one of the best
 
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 align:start position:0%
documents I've ever seen it breaks
 
00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 align:start position:0%
things down into a very understandable
 
00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 align:start position:0%
um or gives you an idea what six 1646 or
 
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
47 sorry what 647 does and essentially
 
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 align:start position:0%
um as I think all of you know that
 
00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 align:start position:0%
there's been a group of people since uh
 
00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
more than a decade ago that had their
 
00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 align:start position:0%
benefits changed there are several
 
00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:50.439 align:start position:0%
different tiers as you'll see on the
 
00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 align:start position:0%
document Marty gave you were provided
 
00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
where you have it's a second page by the
 
00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 align:start position:0%
way um of that document what this bill
 
00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 align:start position:0%
does and what again 1647 does is simply
 
00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 align:start position:0%
brings everybody to the same level the
 
00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 align:start position:0%
uh multiplier 2.5 once you're vested uh
 
00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
after 10 years everybody falls into the
 
00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:17.359 align:start position:0%
2.5 multiplier and you'll see on the top
 
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 align:start position:0%
of the page above 10 years there are all
 
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
these different
 
00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
tiers um until you get over to tier C
 
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 align:start position:0%
which is anybody that's been hired after
 
00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 align:start position:0%
71 11 they have a multiplier of two and
 
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
again this bill treats everybody the
 
00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 align:start position:0%
same after 10 years of vesting which I
 
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
think is a fairness issue and it's
 
00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 align:start position:0%
something that representative Maguire
 
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
Dan Maguire and I have looked to uh
 
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 align:start position:0%
tackle for years and I know Dan would
 
00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
like to probably say something because
 
00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:50.840 align:start position:0%
he's been very much involv I'm sorry Dan
 
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
Maguire has been very much involved in
 
00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 align:start position:0%
this and has pushed hard for us to bring
 
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 align:start position:0%
will thank you and thank you committee
 
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
um so this bill is the successor to to
 
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
House Bill 436 if you remember House
 
00:05:18.749 --> 00:05:18.759 align:start position:0%
Bill 436 that was the one that um for
 
00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 align:start position:0%
the middle group of people that were um
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
employed on uh July 1st uh 2011 uh but
 
00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
not yet vested they had their
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
pension um reduced considerably the 2
 
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:36.520 align:start position:0%
and a half% multiplier became 2% and
 
00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
there were other changes so 436 was the
 
00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
bill that restored essentially all those
 
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:43.230 align:start position:0%
bill that restored essentially all those
other

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:47.240 align:start position:0%
changes um it was very expensive it was
 
00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
uh um going to be um $25 million a year
 
00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
for 10 years something like that and so
 
00:05:57.469 --> 00:05:57.479 align:start position:0%
um it passed the house it passed your
 
00:05:59.070 --> 00:05:59.080 align:start position:0%
committee quite strongly it passed the
 
00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
house strongly we put it it came to our
 
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 align:start position:0%
part of the um finance committee we
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
argued over it I personally thought that
 
00:06:11.029 --> 00:06:11.039 align:start position:0%
it was too expensive and I wanted
 
00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 align:start position:0%
something like
 
00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
1647 um but I was shouted down and we
 
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 align:start position:0%
put it in the budget um as part of
 
00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 align:start position:0%
another compromise dealing with other
 
00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:24.160 align:start position:0%
other parts of the budget we sent it
 
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate they ripped it out of
 
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
the budget okay and instead they put in
 
00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:30.710 align:start position:0%
the budget okay and instead they put in
this

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:33.720 align:start position:0%
commission um uh a couple of you here
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
are members of this commission but they
 
00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
put in a commission to study the whole
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
situation the commission you now have
 
00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 align:start position:0%
the report and and their recommendation
 
00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 align:start position:0%
was what is now
 
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 align:start position:0%
1647 it's much cheaper it's more like 55
 
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
million now and and there's some ongoing
 
00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:55.560 align:start position:0%
because because you know people who are
 
00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
ongoing will have a will have a better
 
00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.240 align:start position:0%
pension so there's some ongoing cost but
 
00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:03.000 align:start position:0%
but to catch us up sort of is is 55
 
00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:08.879 align:start position:0%
million not 250 million and um so and I
 
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
I personally think this is very fair
 
00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 align:start position:0%
this is in fact very similar to what I
 
00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 align:start position:0%
was arguing for when we were doing the
 
00:07:20.070 --> 00:07:20.080 align:start position:0%
budget um but but uh as um
 
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
representative Lehman mentioned um this
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
conc the main changes here are on the
 
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
multiplier only not on all the ancillary
 
00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:32.560 align:start position:0%
stuff not on the definition of income or
 
00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:35.240 align:start position:0%
the definition of service and you know
 
00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:37.599 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff is is not in here
 
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
and I think appropriately um but it's
 
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 align:start position:0%
it's really about the
 
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:46.960 align:start position:0%
multiplier so um I personally think uh
 
00:07:49.469 --> 00:07:49.479 align:start position:0%
you know this bill the thing we have to
 
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:52.440 align:start position:0%
have in the back of our mind is what can
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
we get through you know getting through
 
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:57.280 align:start position:0%
the house hopefully is not a big deal or
 
00:07:59.670 --> 00:07:59.680 align:start position:0%
not too complicated but but through the
 
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:02.000 align:start position:0%
entire process and having the governor
 
00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:04.440 align:start position:0%
sign it you know that's where we've been
 
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:06.400 align:start position:0%
running into roadblocks on this kind of
 
00:08:10.309 --> 00:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
thing and so um we have to be careful
 
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:14.000 align:start position:0%
not to ask for too much in order to push
 
00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
it through so thank you are there any
 
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
questions for representative
 
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
leean representative O'Brien good
 
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:23.280 align:start position:0%
morning thank you good morning Madame
 
00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:26.840 align:start position:0%
chair how are you uh
 
00:08:31.869 --> 00:08:31.879 align:start position:0%
Representatives um when this bill was uh
 
00:08:34.230 --> 00:08:34.240 align:start position:0%
when the pension system was originally
 
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
changed and I think uh off the top of my
 
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.080 align:start position:0%
head 2011 around within that time frame
 
00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:44.560 align:start position:0%
so there's been this cost of deduction
 
00:08:47.590 --> 00:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
everything has been around since 2011
 
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
when you ran the numbers and just I
 
00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:51.240 align:start position:0%
think for the new members of this
 
00:08:54.829 --> 00:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
committee did anybody focus on how much
 
00:08:58.150 --> 00:08:58.160 align:start position:0%
money the state was actually saved and
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
you know I'm not looking looking for a
 
00:09:02.829 --> 00:09:02.839 align:start position:0%
definition if it was a savings if we
 
00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:05.720 align:start position:0%
have to pay back at this particular time
 
00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720 align:start position:0%
for what I call this mistake you may not
 
00:09:12.790 --> 00:09:12.800 align:start position:0%
but the thing is the state did receive a
 
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
benefit where municipalities had a step
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
forward for a long period of time and I
 
00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
just wonder if that number is wholly
 
00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:25.880 align:start position:0%
recognized I yeah sure so yes thank you
 
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
for the question representative um
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
it's it's very hard to answer that
 
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:34.440 align:start position:0%
question because there were many changes
 
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.360 align:start position:0%
made as I said not just to the
 
00:09:38.470 --> 00:09:38.480 align:start position:0%
multiplier but there were changes made
 
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:41.720 align:start position:0%
to the definitions the ages all kinds of
 
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:44.800 align:start position:0%
other things some changes were made for
 
00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:47.800 align:start position:0%
group one and group two some changes
 
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
were made just for group two um and then
 
00:09:53.750 --> 00:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
you talk about savings to the state um
 
00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:55.800 align:start position:0%
there were was also as you know the
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
state used to pay municipalities a
 
00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
significant part of pension costs that
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
went away but on the other hand because
 
00:10:07.310 --> 00:10:07.320 align:start position:0%
of those changes in the numbers
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
municipalities saved a lot right so one
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
point I should make is the 55 million
 
00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:15.030 align:start position:0%
point I should make is the 55 million
we're

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:15.040 align:start position:0%
we're
 
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:18.720 align:start position:0%
spending benefits mostly
 
00:10:21.509 --> 00:10:21.519 align:start position:0%
municipalities right the the bulk of
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
group two employees work for
 
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities they don't work for the
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
state it's something like uh 4 to1 or
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
five to one something like that the ones
 
00:10:33.230 --> 00:10:33.240 align:start position:0%
in this work for the state mostly work
 
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
for the Department of
 
00:10:37.590 --> 00:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
Corrections um and and also state
 
00:10:40.470 --> 00:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
troopers but but but municipalities
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
almost all firefighters work for
 
00:10:45.509 --> 00:10:45.519 align:start position:0%
municipality and and most police so
 
00:10:48.509 --> 00:10:48.519 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien to respond to
 
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
that during the budget negotiations in
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
2011 the savings from the pension P from
 
00:10:58.310 --> 00:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
changes to the pension system will well
 
00:10:58.320 --> 00:10:59.750 align:start position:0%
changes to the pension system will well
recognize

00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
recognize
 
00:11:03.389 --> 00:11:03.399 align:start position:0%
in resolving the billion doll shortfall
 
00:11:05.509 --> 00:11:05.519 align:start position:0%
we faced that year which I believe you
 
00:11:09.030 --> 00:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.030 --> 00:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
about follow followup thank you madam
 
00:11:15.629 --> 00:11:15.639 align:start position:0%
chair for the followup uh one of the
 
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
things that is uh highlight and as you
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
know representative Maguire and
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
representative leechman uh I wear two
 
00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
hats and a helmet you know being a
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
former firefighter but the other hat
 
00:11:31.750 --> 00:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
that I where is uh vice president of the
 
00:11:34.629 --> 00:11:34.639 align:start position:0%
board of alderman in nashar and one of
 
00:11:37.629 --> 00:11:37.639 align:start position:0%
the issues and it's really truly an
 
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:42.760 align:start position:0%
issue of uh you know keeping retaining
 
00:11:46.629 --> 00:11:46.639 align:start position:0%
you know hiring and retaining new so I
 
00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839 align:start position:0%
know you can't forecast you haven't got
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
the crystal ball or neither do I but how
 
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:55.040 align:start position:0%
do you feel this bill would help in that
 
00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:57.760 align:start position:0%
those two particular
 
00:12:00.310 --> 00:12:00.320 align:start position:0%
areas okay
 
00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.870 align:start position:0%
areas okay
[Music]

00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question one of the
 
00:12:06.629 --> 00:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
things we looked at on the retirement
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
commission as the chair pointed out uh
 
00:12:10.509 --> 00:12:10.519 align:start position:0%
she served on the commission along with
 
00:12:13.629 --> 00:12:13.639 align:start position:0%
myself is a retention issue and it was
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
felt that by adding this additional
 
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
retention tool by saying that everybody
 
00:12:20.470 --> 00:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
was treated the same and increasing the
 
00:12:23.590 --> 00:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
multiplier by 2.5 that would help and
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
people's decision one to stay longer
 
00:12:27.629 --> 00:12:27.639 align:start position:0%
with the state and maybe come to work
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:32.670 --> 00:12:32.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair representative
 
00:12:34.990 --> 00:12:35.000 align:start position:0%
groa thank you this question is for
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
either one of you does um house bill um
 
00:12:42.509 --> 00:12:42.519 align:start position:0%
1647 addressed the recommendations from
 
00:12:47.430 --> 00:12:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
commission if you look inside the
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
document I handed out from the
 
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
retirement commission there's a list of
 
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
items that U the commission suggested
 
00:12:59.069 --> 00:12:59.079 align:start position:0%
move forward and not all of these were
 
00:13:01.350 --> 00:13:01.360 align:start position:0%
recommended unanimously this particular
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
item was an 8 to6 vote to support this
 
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:06.880 align:start position:0%
but I think it's on the second or third
 
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:09.920 align:start position:0%
page it points out what items should be
 
00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
brought forward through legislation and
 
00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
I was asked to bring this particular
 
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.590 align:start position:0%
I was asked to bring this particular
item

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
item
 
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:17.600 align:start position:0%
forward follow
 
00:13:21.389 --> 00:13:21.399 align:start position:0%
up and the $55 million fiscal note is to
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
be paid by the state the state and it
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
brings everybody up to date so that from
 
00:13:30.550 --> 00:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
then on it becomes the responsibility of
 
00:13:32.590 --> 00:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
the state and municipalities correct
 
00:13:34.870 --> 00:13:34.880 align:start position:0%
that's correct thank
 
00:13:39.269 --> 00:13:39.279 align:start position:0%
you okay goie you have no anyone else
 
00:13:39.279 --> 00:13:40.269 align:start position:0%
you okay goie you have no anyone else
representative

00:13:40.269 --> 00:13:40.279 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
laus um I see there's not a fiscal note
 
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
yet so I just
 
00:13:50.670 --> 00:13:50.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh want to verify that the 55 million
 
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:54.560 align:start position:0%
covers uh the entire cost of I believe
 
00:13:57.590 --> 00:13:57.600 align:start position:0%
Backus there is in fact a fiscal note
 
00:13:59.470 --> 00:13:59.480 align:start position:0%
that wasn't included in in the bill that
 
00:14:03.069 --> 00:14:03.079 align:start position:0%
you got but it some people haven't ah
 
00:14:04.590 --> 00:14:04.600 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I just want what I'm
 
00:14:07.790 --> 00:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
asking is um is there any change to the
 
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:09.720 align:start position:0%
unfunded liability as a result would
 
00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:13.240 align:start position:0%
there be as a result of passing
 
00:14:16.590 --> 00:14:16.600 align:start position:0%
this so I believe the answer is no okay
 
00:14:19.069 --> 00:14:19.079 align:start position:0%
um it's 50 it's actually closer to 56
 
00:14:19.079 --> 00:14:20.230 align:start position:0%
um it's 50 it's actually closer to 56
million

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:20.240 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
55.9 but but the answer is no but there
 
00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:28.160 align:start position:0%
is extra cost to munici both the state
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
and municip IP alties the state about a
 
00:14:31.670 --> 00:14:31.680 align:start position:0%
million dollars a year and
 
00:14:35.189 --> 00:14:35.199 align:start position:0%
municipalities about four ongoing okay
 
00:14:35.199 --> 00:14:40.829 align:start position:0%
municipalities about four ongoing okay
thank

00:14:40.829 --> 00:14:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:44.639 align:start position:0%
you represent gold thank you madam chair
 
00:14:47.069 --> 00:14:47.079 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to thank you on behalf of
 
00:14:49.629 --> 00:14:49.639 align:start position:0%
the municipalities that I um represent
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
Warner Bradford and Haner and especially
 
00:14:54.110 --> 00:14:54.120 align:start position:0%
a shout out to Haner I will support this
 
00:14:58.710 --> 00:14:58.720 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative Simon
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um just looking at
 
00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:02.279 align:start position:0%
the estimated political subdivision
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
impact uh on the fiscal note uh year
 
00:15:09.030 --> 00:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
2026 is4 million
 
00:15:14.069 --> 00:15:14.079 align:start position:0%
90,000 and uh 2027 is $4.2 million uh
 
00:15:15.790 --> 00:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's an estimate that's
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
just based on the potential increase in
 
00:15:20.189 --> 00:15:20.199 align:start position:0%
salaries that is going to be covered
 
00:15:24.230 --> 00:15:24.240 align:start position:0%
under the plan is that correct yes um uh
 
00:15:26.389 --> 00:15:26.399 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin I think prepared this you can
 
00:15:28.990 --> 00:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
ask him specific Mr Carlin will be the
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
next speaker very well thank you madam
 
00:15:34.350 --> 00:15:34.360 align:start position:0%
chair okay any other questions for the
 
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
sponsors all right thank you very much
 
00:15:39.110 --> 00:15:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you may I point out one sort of
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
technical thing if you if you don't mind
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
um go
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
ahead there's there's what I think is a
 
00:15:50.749 --> 00:15:50.759 align:start position:0%
poor drafting in the bill um on page uh
 
00:15:52.629 --> 00:15:52.639 align:start position:0%
three line
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
18 and also
 
00:16:00.590 --> 00:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
um I think this there's the same thing
 
00:16:02.829 --> 00:16:02.839 align:start position:0%
thing uh I think there's the same thing
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
somewhere else but um let's look at page
 
00:16:06.710 --> 00:16:06.720 align:start position:0%
three line
 
00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:12.399 align:start position:0%
18 um it says uh maximum number of years
 
00:16:15.069 --> 00:16:15.079 align:start position:0%
not in excess and it used to say 40 and
 
00:16:17.710 --> 00:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
a half and now it has this phrase limits
 
00:16:19.949 --> 00:16:19.959 align:start position:0%
under such and such if you look in your
 
00:16:21.150 --> 00:16:21.160 align:start position:0%
new blue
 
00:16:25.670 --> 00:16:25.680 align:start position:0%
book in this uh 100 a colon
 
00:16:29.590 --> 00:16:29.600 align:start position:0%
6-a um it doesn't there's no there's no
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
years in that right so so it's it's
 
00:16:35.829 --> 00:16:35.839 align:start position:0%
really confusing to say the number of
 
00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:39.720 align:start position:0%
years is not in excess of that section
 
00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:41.720 align:start position:0%
when there's no years in that section
 
00:16:44.949 --> 00:16:44.959 align:start position:0%
right so I I would
 
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:47.600 align:start position:0%
suggest you you simply re you can you
 
00:16:51.189 --> 00:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
can safely remove this this whole phrase
 
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:54.360 align:start position:0%
um because because that section the
 
00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:56.680 align:start position:0%
section it refers to is the one that
 
00:16:59.269 --> 00:16:59.279 align:start position:0%
limits that has an overall raw limit on
 
00:17:03.309 --> 00:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
a pension of 85% of of the maximum
 
00:17:06.710 --> 00:17:06.720 align:start position:0%
salary or some some amount some I don't
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
know if it's $100,000 120,000 or
 
00:17:11.429 --> 00:17:11.439 align:start position:0%
something um that's what that section
 
00:17:14.549 --> 00:17:14.559 align:start position:0%
does and that section will apply whether
 
00:17:17.710 --> 00:17:17.720 align:start position:0%
this is written here or not so to me
 
00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:19.720 align:start position:0%
it's simpler you could just if you're
 
00:17:22.189 --> 00:17:22.199 align:start position:0%
making an amendment to this uh cross
 
00:17:23.949 --> 00:17:23.959 align:start position:0%
that out and I think it it appears in a
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
second place as well so probably under
 
00:17:28.549 --> 00:17:28.559 align:start position:0%
normal retirement since the section
 
00:17:30.590 --> 00:17:30.600 align:start position:0%
you're quoting deal with disability
 
00:17:32.830 --> 00:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
retirement Madam chair but anyway we'll
 
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:34.400 align:start position:0%
we'll look at that in
 
00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee now Madam chair you can see
 
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
why we affectionately call
 
00:17:40.669 --> 00:17:40.679 align:start position:0%
Representative DM Maguire the professor
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
so yes thank
 
00:17:46.230 --> 00:17:46.240 align:start position:0%
you all right other questions thank you
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:03.149 align:start position:0%
 
Carlin

00:18:03.149 --> 00:18:03.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.240 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Madame chair for the record
 
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
Marty Carlin representing the New
 
00:18:09.070 --> 00:18:09.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system uh the
 
00:18:10.510 --> 00:18:10.520 align:start position:0%
retirement system doesn't have a
 
00:18:12.190 --> 00:18:12.200 align:start position:0%
position on the bill we consider it a
 
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:14.520 align:start position:0%
policy matter left to the
 
00:18:18.390 --> 00:18:18.400 align:start position:0%
legislature um the previous speakers
 
00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:20.200 align:start position:0%
referenced the handout uh that I
 
00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:21.520 align:start position:0%
provided to the committee there are some
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
extras on the table if they haven't all
 
00:18:27.390 --> 00:18:27.400 align:start position:0%
been taken yet um if basically as as a
 
00:18:29.070 --> 00:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
brief walk through
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
this just this handout describes the
 
00:18:33.669 --> 00:18:33.679 align:start position:0%
change which is to the benefit
 
00:18:36.149 --> 00:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
multiplier there there are three
 
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:38.440 align:start position:0%
components that go into calculating a
 
00:18:41.470 --> 00:18:41.480 align:start position:0%
pension it's you how long you've worked
 
00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:43.799 align:start position:0%
months and years your average final
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
compensation either on a high three or a
 
00:18:49.669 --> 00:18:49.679 align:start position:0%
high five um average with some some
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
other uh caps within that in the statute
 
00:18:55.270 --> 00:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
uh and this benefit multiplier which is
 
00:18:57.549 --> 00:18:57.559 align:start position:0%
basically you think of it as an acral
 
00:18:58.950 --> 00:18:58.960 align:start position:0%
rate every year you work you're
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
recruiting you know 2.1 2.2% of your
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
ultimately your AFC when you retire so
 
00:19:08.430 --> 00:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
this bill changes the multiplier it does
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
not change the average final
 
00:19:12.669 --> 00:19:12.679 align:start position:0%
compensation calculation nor the
 
00:19:14.669 --> 00:19:14.679 align:start position:0%
definition of earnable compensation what
 
00:19:18.110 --> 00:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
goes into that AFC calculation so a
 
00:19:20.870 --> 00:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
house bill uh 436 last year did changed
 
00:19:22.950 --> 00:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
all three in different ways so this this
 
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
is more focused specifically on the
 
00:19:27.549 --> 00:19:27.559 align:start position:0%
multiplier that's one of the reasons
 
00:19:29.310 --> 00:19:29.320 align:start position:0%
that it's less costly even though it
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
affects more people um so the chart
 
00:19:36.470 --> 00:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
under the background heading just shows
 
00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:39.440 align:start position:0%
the um the minimum age in service
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for group two retirement uh
 
00:19:44.110 --> 00:19:44.120 align:start position:0%
for folks who weren't vested prior to
 
00:19:47.390 --> 00:19:47.400 align:start position:0%
January 1st of 2012 uh plus the
 
00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:49.200 align:start position:0%
multiplier that they currently have
 
00:19:51.669 --> 00:19:51.679 align:start position:0%
under the statute and what the proposal
 
00:19:55.390 --> 00:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
would uh Grant to those tiers after 10
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
years um we started referring refering
 
00:20:00.789 --> 00:20:00.799 align:start position:0%
to the groups both group one and group
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
two as tiers uh last year just because
 
00:20:06.310 --> 00:20:06.320 align:start position:0%
it was kind of a mouthful to say uh
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
member was in service prior to 71 of 11
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
and not vested prior to 11 one of 12 but
 
00:20:12.909 --> 00:20:12.919 align:start position:0%
the that that nomenclature isn't in the
 
00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
statute it's the long terms in there but
 
00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
just for shorthand uh we went to that so
 
00:20:21.310 --> 00:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
uh and on this document we don't break
 
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
it down typically this much tier B 432
 
00:20:26.630 --> 00:20:26.640 align:start position:0%
and one but there are steps on the
 
00:20:28.510 --> 00:20:28.520 align:start position:0%
ladder of that transition table for
 
00:20:32.070 --> 00:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
those tier B members um so that just
 
00:20:35.070 --> 00:20:35.080 align:start position:0%
shows all of the group The the
 
00:20:36.830 --> 00:20:36.840 align:start position:0%
membership tiers affected by this
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
proposal as a count over on the far
 
00:20:41.830 --> 00:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
right hand side um again just just for
 
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
scale to look at that and on page two is
 
00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:47.240 align:start position:0%
a summary of the Actuarial analysis
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
under Financial
 
00:20:51.430 --> 00:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
considerations um earlier question which
 
00:20:52.990 --> 00:20:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire correctly
 
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:56.240 align:start position:0%
answered was the 55.9 million general
 
00:20:59.470 --> 00:20:59.480 align:start position:0%
fund appropriation uh included in this
 
00:21:02.310 --> 00:21:02.320 align:start position:0%
bill currently would uh cover the
 
00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:05.000 align:start position:0%
projected unfunded liability for this
 
00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
change um there is also a future ongoing
 
00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:10.720 align:start position:0%
normal cost is what it's referred to the
 
00:21:13.029 --> 00:21:13.039 align:start position:0%
cost of benefits as as they acrew you
 
00:21:15.029 --> 00:21:15.039 align:start position:0%
know in the years that people work going
 
00:21:18.750 --> 00:21:18.760 align:start position:0%
forward that's would increase uh the
 
00:21:20.950 --> 00:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
group two police and fire employer rates
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
by a little bit under 1% of pay uh
 
00:21:26.789 --> 00:21:26.799 align:start position:0%
beginning in fiscal 26 they were already
 
00:21:29.350 --> 00:21:29.360 align:start position:0%
in the 2425 rates were certified a
 
00:21:31.390 --> 00:21:31.400 align:start position:0%
couple years ago you know that cake is
 
00:21:32.950 --> 00:21:32.960 align:start position:0%
baked so it won't start showing up in
 
00:21:36.390 --> 00:21:36.400 align:start position:0%
the rates until uh July 1 of
 
00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:38.630 align:start position:0%
the rates until uh July 1 of
25

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
um and you know we also are going to
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
have some programming costs associated
 
00:21:45.230 --> 00:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
with that but that's pretty much goes
 
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:48.640 align:start position:0%
without saying for any change so um and
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
then the third page is the chart uh
 
00:21:54.870 --> 00:21:54.880 align:start position:0%
representative leean um referred to this
 
00:21:57.310 --> 00:21:57.320 align:start position:0%
is something we prepared for the uh
 
00:22:00.029 --> 00:22:00.039 align:start position:0%
Commission uh in the fall to look at
 
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:02.440 align:start position:0%
it's just an illustration just showing
 
00:22:05.269 --> 00:22:05.279 align:start position:0%
you know for what year someone's working
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
what their multiplier is under the
 
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:09.400 align:start position:0%
proposal so just just for quick
 
00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
illustration if you look at the column
 
00:22:14.710 --> 00:22:14.720 align:start position:0%
that says tier B2 those are members who
 
00:22:17.230 --> 00:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
I had four more than four but less than
 
00:22:20.990 --> 00:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
six years as of one one of 12 and their
 
00:22:23.669 --> 00:22:23.679 align:start position:0%
uh minimum age in service is 48 with 23
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
years of service and their multiplier
 
00:22:28.269 --> 00:22:28.279 align:start position:0%
currently is 2.2% for each year they
 
00:22:32.070 --> 00:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
worked so that person would acrew
 
00:22:35.870 --> 00:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
2.2% per year 22% of their ASC in their
 
00:22:37.549 --> 00:22:37.559 align:start position:0%
first 10 years and then for the
 
00:22:39.470 --> 00:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
remaining years in their career the
 
00:22:41.269 --> 00:22:41.279 align:start position:0%
acral would be at
 
00:22:44.510 --> 00:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
2.5% so in that
 
00:22:47.789 --> 00:22:47.799 align:start position:0%
um uh situation that would if somebody
 
00:22:50.430 --> 00:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
worked the minimum 23 years it would
 
00:22:54.029 --> 00:22:54.039 align:start position:0%
increase their percentage the multiplier
 
00:22:56.950 --> 00:22:56.960 align:start position:0%
you know 23 years time 2.2 is
 
00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:58.750 align:start position:0%
you know 23 years time 2.2 is
50.6%

00:22:58.750 --> 00:22:58.760 align:start position:0%
50.6%
 
00:23:01.990 --> 00:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
uh and it's in with 10 years at 2.2 and
 
00:23:05.669 --> 00:23:05.679 align:start position:0%
13 years at 2.5 it becomes 54.5% of your
 
00:23:09.110 --> 00:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
AFC so so this would represent a a
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
benefit increase um you know for all
 
00:23:15.149 --> 00:23:15.159 align:start position:0%
members including those in tier C which
 
00:23:18.310 --> 00:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
were folks hired after 7 one of 11 in
 
00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:19.350 align:start position:0%
were folks hired after 7 one of 11 in
future

00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
future
 
00:23:24.269 --> 00:23:24.279 align:start position:0%
hires um again i' lot to unpack here but
 
00:23:26.230 --> 00:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
I'd be glad to answer any questions the
 
00:23:29.830 --> 00:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
committee would have
 
00:23:31.230 --> 00:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
thank you for all this valuable
 
00:23:33.710 --> 00:23:33.720 align:start position:0%
information representative
 
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you madam chair uh Mr
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
Colin to refer back I I just wonder if
 
00:23:43.310 --> 00:23:43.320 align:start position:0%
there's anywhere that uh through
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
research or whatever is that a number
 
00:23:48.029 --> 00:23:48.039 align:start position:0%
that is easy to grab on what I'm talking
 
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:51.360 align:start position:0%
about since 2011 until now
 
00:23:54.750 --> 00:23:54.760 align:start position:0%
municipalities municipalities had born
 
00:23:59.190 --> 00:23:59.200 align:start position:0%
from originally 30 some odd percent 35%
 
00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
down to zero what was the cost savings
 
00:24:04.590 --> 00:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
to the state on that and so in other
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
words to say this is extra money excuse
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
me representative
 
00:24:08.760 --> 00:24:09.990 align:start position:0%
me representative
[Music]

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:13.390 --> 00:24:13.400 align:start position:0%
O'Brien we're I do not want to debate
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
the question of who pays what I am
 
00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
trying we're trying to discover the
 
00:24:21.630 --> 00:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
entire cost to the state and the
 
00:24:24.630 --> 00:24:24.640 align:start position:0%
municipalities and the employees and the
 
00:24:27.549 --> 00:24:27.559 align:start position:0%
benefits to them the distribution of who
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
PID what is something I don't think we
 
00:24:33.389 --> 00:24:33.399 align:start position:0%
need to debate here yeah uh as Madam
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
chair you always take the edge off thank
 
00:24:39.230 --> 00:24:39.240 align:start position:0%
you very much I much appreciate there's
 
00:24:41.029 --> 00:24:41.039 align:start position:0%
a separate bill on that you'll get your
 
00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:43.240 align:start position:0%
chance but Madam chair would it be fair
 
00:24:45.789 --> 00:24:45.799 align:start position:0%
for me what I'm searching for is that
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
particular number I believe you should

and reminding everyone about House Bill
 
00:25:45.789 --> 00:25:45.799 align:start position:0%
436 I won't recap that they did a fine
 
00:25:48.389 --> 00:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
job uh painting the picture of last
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
session where we had um overwhelming
 
00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:52.600 align:start position:0%
support from not only this committee but
 
00:25:54.950 --> 00:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
the entire house uh to restore pension
 
00:25:58.430 --> 00:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
benefits lost from 2011 um um
 
00:26:01.070 --> 00:26:01.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately as we we know that was
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
removed uh by the Senate and replaced
 
00:26:06.430 --> 00:26:06.440 align:start position:0%
with the retirement benefits commission
 
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:08.120 align:start position:0%
which I was lucky enough to be able to
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%
serve on uh as the clerk I believe that
 
00:26:17.029 --> 00:26:17.039 align:start position:0%
the commission um came forward with some
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
very productive dialogue and we were
 
00:26:22.269 --> 00:26:22.279 align:start position:0%
able to provide a lot of uh answers to a
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
lot of questions as to what the problem
 
00:26:28.070 --> 00:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
is and how we got here um I wish I could
 
00:26:30.269 --> 00:26:30.279 align:start position:0%
sit before you and tell you today that
 
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
the Recruitment and Retention issues uh
 
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:35.720 align:start position:0%
have been solved or even been improved
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
since last year I can tell you that is
 
00:26:40.870 --> 00:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
uh not the case in fact just the
 
00:26:44.789 --> 00:26:44.799 align:start position:0%
opposite um we continue to uh struggle
 
00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.600 align:start position:0%
to find Personnel to want to work in
 
00:26:51.190 --> 00:26:51.200 align:start position:0%
these Public Safety professions um and
 
00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:55.080 align:start position:0%
retirement is cited as one of those um
 
00:26:57.990 --> 00:26:58.000 align:start position:0%
Number One issues as to why we cannot
 
00:26:59.350 --> 00:26:59.360 align:start position:0%
recruit nor
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
retain uh firefighters in the state of
 
00:27:02.039 --> 00:27:03.190 align:start position:0%
retain uh firefighters in the state of
New

00:27:03.190 --> 00:27:03.200 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when we talked about this
 
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:07.240 align:start position:0%
issue in the commission uh there was a
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
lot of back and forth and we eventually
 
00:27:12.909 --> 00:27:12.919 align:start position:0%
got to a point where it was uh
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
determined that we should be focusing
 
00:27:18.269 --> 00:27:18.279 align:start position:0%
holistically on improving the
 
00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention crisis in our
 
00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:23.360 align:start position:0%
state and not hyperfocusing on one group
 
00:27:23.360 --> 00:27:26.029 align:start position:0%
state and not hyperfocusing on one group
of

00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:28.399 align:start position:0%
individuals while we believed that house
 
00:27:28.399 --> 00:27:29.669 align:start position:0%
individuals while we believed that house
bill

00:27:29.669 --> 00:27:29.679 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
436 Still Remains The Fix to one uh
 
00:27:37.269 --> 00:27:37.279 align:start position:0%
catastrophic issue in our state with
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
pension um we we decided to take the
 
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
lead from those in the room that wanted
 
00:27:44.389 --> 00:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
to uh affect more change with more
 
00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:46.640 align:start position:0%
members and with that we feel that we
 
00:27:48.990 --> 00:27:49.000 align:start position:0%
came to a fair compromise and that is
 
00:27:51.190 --> 00:27:51.200 align:start position:0%
the provisions that are here in uh
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
before us in House Bill
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
1647 uh we believe taking a look at the
 
00:27:58.710 --> 00:27:58.720 align:start position:0%
entire picture with the members in our
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
state uh encouraging those to want to
 
00:28:04.149 --> 00:28:04.159 align:start position:0%
come into public service and Public
 
00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
Safety in our state by increasing a
 
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
benefit uh for all um restoring for some
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
and increasing for others uh I think
 
00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
this is a huge step forward for the
 
00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:19.200 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire um I'm certain
 
00:28:21.789 --> 00:28:21.799 align:start position:0%
that this committee will will support it
 
00:28:24.549 --> 00:28:24.559 align:start position:0%
similar to uh your support of House Bill
 
00:28:26.909 --> 00:28:26.919 align:start position:0%
436 uh I look forward to increased
 
00:28:29.269 --> 00:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
discussions on this and I look forward
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
to uh getting this through and and again
 
00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.080 align:start position:0%
Campo good morning Madam chair and
 
00:29:19.110 --> 00:29:19.120 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Frank Campo I'm a
 
00:29:20.950 --> 00:29:20.960 align:start position:0%
sergeant with the state police I also
 
00:29:22.350 --> 00:29:22.360 align:start position:0%
serve as a president of the Troopers
 
00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:24.240 align:start position:0%
Association I'd like to start off by
 
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
just thanking this committee for their
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
hard work on house build 436 last year
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
it passed overwhelmingly in the house
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
unfortunately it didn't uh didn't pass
 
00:29:36.110 --> 00:29:36.120 align:start position:0%
through the Senate um like to talk just
 
00:29:37.950 --> 00:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
a little bit to start here with uh the
 
00:29:40.070 --> 00:29:40.080 align:start position:0%
retention issues that specifically we're
 
00:29:41.950 --> 00:29:41.960 align:start position:0%
having with the state police I think
 
00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:43.760 align:start position:0%
it's no secret uh at the beginning of
 
00:29:46.149 --> 00:29:46.159 align:start position:0%
2023 the state police had approximately
 
00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:50.080 align:start position:0%
a 20% vacancy rate uh but during 2023 we
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
had one of our best hiring years ever
 
00:29:55.470 --> 00:29:55.480 align:start position:0%
which was um you know very fantastic but
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
unfortunately here we are at the
 
00:29:59.669 --> 00:29:59.679 align:start position:0%
beginning beginning of 2024 and we're
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
still at the same vacancy rate you know
 
00:30:04.269 --> 00:30:04.279 align:start position:0%
what does that mean as many people that
 
00:30:06.269 --> 00:30:06.279 align:start position:0%
we were able to bring in last year
 
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
that's the same amount of people that
 
00:30:10.830 --> 00:30:10.840 align:start position:0%
left um in this trend it just it can't
 
00:30:12.909 --> 00:30:12.919 align:start position:0%
keep it can't continue we can't keep
 
00:30:14.630 --> 00:30:14.640 align:start position:0%
recycling experienced Troopers for
 
00:30:17.269 --> 00:30:17.279 align:start position:0%
inexperienced ones we are the back stop
 
00:30:19.269 --> 00:30:19.279 align:start position:0%
of law enforcement in this state we
 
00:30:20.509 --> 00:30:20.519 align:start position:0%
investigate the majority of the
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
homicides we investigate all officer
 
00:30:25.230 --> 00:30:25.240 align:start position:0%
involved shootings our SWAT team our K9
 
00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
team our crash analysis reconstruction
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
team uh are responding to more more
 
00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
calls than ever um there was a need to
 
00:30:33.710 --> 00:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
create a northern border Alliance and
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
that fell on the state police to manage
 
00:30:37.909 --> 00:30:37.919 align:start position:0%
as well um something something needs to
 
00:30:40.389 --> 00:30:40.399 align:start position:0%
change uh last year we saw a trend of
 
00:30:42.430 --> 00:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
more experience Troopers leaving for
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
other endeavors and that Trend continues
 
00:30:47.549 --> 00:30:47.559 align:start position:0%
today but we're also seeing a trend of
 
00:30:50.230 --> 00:30:50.240 align:start position:0%
our younger Troopers leaving as well you
 
00:30:52.430 --> 00:30:52.440 align:start position:0%
know since the changes in 2012 New
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire no longer has a competitive uh
 
00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880 align:start position:0%
pension benefit that coupled with better
 
00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:58.360 align:start position:0%
opportun unities in the private sector
 
00:31:00.549 --> 00:31:00.559 align:start position:0%
or federal government makes it um almost
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
impossible for us to retain our
 
00:31:06.830 --> 00:31:06.840 align:start position:0%
talent the provisions in HB 1647 are a
 
00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
huge step in the right direction it not
 
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:10.960 align:start position:0%
only addresses issues we're facing for
 
00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.080 align:start position:0%
the folks in the middle te it also um
 
00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:15.679 align:start position:0%
addresses issues that we're facing with
 
00:31:17.909 --> 00:31:17.919 align:start position:0%
those in TRC as well um this bill just
 
00:31:19.990 --> 00:31:20.000 align:start position:0%
makes sense it would increase an
 
00:31:21.750 --> 00:31:21.760 align:start position:0%
employees multiplier the longer he or
 
00:31:24.149 --> 00:31:24.159 align:start position:0%
she remains in active service and that's
 
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:26.320 align:start position:0%
exactly what we need an incentive to
 
00:31:28.990 --> 00:31:29.000 align:start position:0%
keep our people um in the job here and
 
00:31:31.870 --> 00:31:31.880 align:start position:0%
yes this bill will cost money but you
 
00:31:34.149 --> 00:31:34.159 align:start position:0%
know what is the cost of of doing
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
nothing here um so for these reasons I
 
00:31:38.110 --> 00:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
would hope that this committee would
 
00:31:39.789 --> 00:31:39.799 align:start position:0%
support this bill I'm happy to answer
 
00:31:41.990 --> 00:31:42.000 align:start position:0%
any questions if anybody has any thank
 
00:31:43.070 --> 00:31:43.080 align:start position:0%

question to you is about the
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
turnover how is it trending in terms of
 
00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:10.120 align:start position:0%
losing experienced and now you're saying
 
00:32:13.789 --> 00:32:13.799 align:start position:0%
retention of new Hye also do you have a
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
data for
 
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:19.840 align:start position:0%
the last few years that's turn over how
 
00:32:23.029 --> 00:32:23.039 align:start position:0%
it's affecting Recruitment and Retention
 
00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:24.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm not sure if I'd be able to
 
00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
explain how it's affecting the turn was
 
00:32:27.990 --> 00:32:28.000 align:start position:0%
affecting Recruitment and Retention but
 
00:32:30.190 --> 00:32:30.200 align:start position:0%
I can certainly get the numbers um for
 
00:32:31.710 --> 00:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
this committee and I can email them to
 
00:32:33.110 --> 00:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
you um as soon as I can get them within
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
the next probably a few days thank you
 
00:32:37.389 --> 00:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
else all right thank you very much thank
 
00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:48.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:51.470 --> 00:32:51.480 align:start position:0%
bodri good morning Madam chair I wish

you all a Happy New Year um Madam
 
00:32:56.509 --> 00:32:56.519 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee my
 
00:32:58.470 --> 00:32:58.480 align:start position:0%
name is bodri I represent the New
 
00:33:00.110 --> 00:33:00.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State permanent firefighters
 
00:33:02.470 --> 00:33:02.480 align:start position:0%
retirement Association and I'm here in
 
00:33:05.789 --> 00:33:05.799 align:start position:0%
favor of this of House Bill
 
00:33:08.710 --> 00:33:08.720 align:start position:0%
1647 uh I would like to Echo uh what
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
Brian stated um this bill helps but it's
 
00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
not a it's not a true fix um 4 436 was a
 
00:33:19.590 --> 00:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
true fix for those members that were not
 
00:33:22.990 --> 00:33:23.000 align:start position:0%
vested as of January 2012 this is a
 
00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:25.720 align:start position:0%
Band-Aid approach to fixing a bigger
 
00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
problem um it does help out uh for for
 
00:33:32.789 --> 00:33:32.799 align:start position:0%
new hires after um January of 2012 by
 
00:33:34.830 --> 00:33:34.840 align:start position:0%
giving them the 2 and a half% after 10
 
00:33:36.950 --> 00:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
years so that should help a little bit
 
00:33:39.549 --> 00:33:39.559 align:start position:0%
on on retention uh but as far as
 
00:33:43.190 --> 00:33:43.200 align:start position:0%
recruitment um it's still the first 10
 
00:33:45.789 --> 00:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
years are still at 2% um and when you
 
00:33:49.029 --> 00:33:49.039 align:start position:0%
look at group one and group two uh group
 
00:33:52.629 --> 00:33:52.639 align:start position:0%
group one benefits are almost uh
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
probably even better than group two now
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
because they get Social Security and and
 
00:33:58.909 --> 00:33:58.919 align:start position:0%
group two doesn't and they get their
 
00:34:00.629 --> 00:34:00.639 align:start position:0%
benefit is calculated at
 
00:34:04.269 --> 00:34:04.279 align:start position:0%
1.67% and and police and fire is at 2%
 
00:34:06.470 --> 00:34:06.480 align:start position:0%
so we're risking our life every day when
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
we go out there for small percentage
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
over what a person that doesn't have to
 
00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
risk their life um is doing so that is a
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
concern um and 436 would have been it
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
did pass this committee it passed the
 
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:26.280 align:start position:0%
house unfortunately the Senate uh didn't
 
00:34:28.589 --> 00:34:28.599 align:start position:0%
buy into it um which is a mistake
 
00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:31.480 align:start position:0%
because uh there's been members of the
 
00:34:33.190 --> 00:34:33.200 align:start position:0%
legislature to say we don't want bills
 
00:34:35.310 --> 00:34:35.320 align:start position:0%
coming in every year well the only way
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
you're going to fix it is if 436 were to
 
00:34:40.389 --> 00:34:40.399 align:start position:0%
pass that fixed the problem that
 
00:34:42.470 --> 00:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
originally happened back in
 
00:34:45.589 --> 00:34:45.599 align:start position:0%
2011 um and with that I would answer any
 
00:34:47.669 --> 00:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
00:34:47.679 --> 00:34:48.950 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
any

00:34:48.950 --> 00:34:48.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:34:51.149 --> 00:34:51.159 align:start position:0%
questions no thank you and I'm sure
 
00:34:53.109 --> 00:34:53.119 align:start position:0%
we'll have your help at the subcommittee
 
00:35:07.390 --> 00:35:07.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.400 --> 00:35:08.270 align:start position:0%
 
good

00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
good
 
00:35:10.550 --> 00:35:10.560 align:start position:0%
morning uh I'd like to take this
 
00:35:12.910 --> 00:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity uh to thank the Edna
 
00:35:16.109 --> 00:35:16.119 align:start position:0%
committee for their hard work last year
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
uh a little bit about myself uh I'm
 
00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
currently a sergeant with the Nashville
 
00:35:21.150 --> 00:35:21.160 align:start position:0%
Police Department I've been there for
 
00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
the last 16 years I'm also 29
 
00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.710 align:start position:0%
the last 16 years I'm also 29
years

00:35:28.710 --> 00:35:28.720 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:35:30.990 --> 00:35:31.000 align:start position:0%
gotcha uh I've been in law enforcement
 
00:35:33.150 --> 00:35:33.160 align:start position:0%
for 29 years my first 13 te were spent
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts um I'm currently here
 
00:35:36.990 --> 00:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire Police
 
00:35:38.870 --> 00:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
Association I'm the treasurer for that
 
00:35:40.710 --> 00:35:40.720 align:start position:0%
organization I'm also the president of
 
00:35:41.990 --> 00:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
the supervisor's Union for the
 
00:35:44.670 --> 00:35:44.680 align:start position:0%
nationville police department uh it was
 
00:35:47.230 --> 00:35:47.240 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that house bill 436 didn't
 
00:35:49.710 --> 00:35:49.720 align:start position:0%
pass last year uh but I believe House
 
00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:52.599 align:start position:0%
Bill 1647 is a step in the right
 
00:35:56.470 --> 00:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
direction um into you know the nhpa
 
00:35:58.750 --> 00:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
whole hardly agrees with and supports
 
00:36:00.190 --> 00:36:00.200 align:start position:0%
that decision that the retirement
 
00:36:02.109 --> 00:36:02.119 align:start position:0%
commission put
 
00:36:04.870 --> 00:36:04.880 align:start position:0%
forward to outline I think what our
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
biggest retention and recruitment
 
00:36:08.270 --> 00:36:08.280 align:start position:0%
problems are is our number one
 
00:36:10.990 --> 00:36:11.000 align:start position:0%
competitor for law enforcement and
 
00:36:13.750 --> 00:36:13.760 align:start position:0%
firefighters is Massachusetts and when
 
00:36:15.510 --> 00:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
we compare the two Retirement Systems we
 
00:36:16.990 --> 00:36:17.000 align:start position:0%
are not even in the same ballpark
 
00:36:19.430 --> 00:36:19.440 align:start position:0%
anymore uh Massachusetts if you compare
 
00:36:21.710 --> 00:36:21.720 align:start position:0%
apples to apples uh you need to do a
 
00:36:25.030 --> 00:36:25.040 align:start position:0%
32ye career after 32 years you'll get an
 
00:36:27.750 --> 00:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
80% pension of your salary after 32
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
years in New Hampshire you're going to
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
get a 64% pension of your salary
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts also offers uh uh health
 
00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
care benefits at 80 to 90% we offer zero
 
00:36:42.190 --> 00:36:42.200 align:start position:0%
I can tell you from working in the
 
00:36:43.510 --> 00:36:43.520 align:start position:0%
recruiting division at the Nashville
 
00:36:45.950 --> 00:36:45.960 align:start position:0%
Police Department I heard numerous times
 
00:36:47.390 --> 00:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
that they were choosing Massachusetts
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
over us because of the pension system
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
alone I came here like I said 16 years
 
00:36:55.230 --> 00:36:55.240 align:start position:0%
ago because New Hampshire had a great
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
reputation for law enforcement they had
 
00:36:59.109 --> 00:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
a great retirement and then when I came
 
00:37:01.990 --> 00:37:02.000 align:start position:0%
here that was taken away from us and now
 
00:37:04.230 --> 00:37:04.240 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing the same level of people
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
coming to our great state to work here
 
00:37:09.670 --> 00:37:09.680 align:start position:0%
and we're not able to recruit anymore
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
and I'm available for any questions
 
00:37:13.390 --> 00:37:13.400 align:start position:0%

00:37:16.349 --> 00:37:16.359 align:start position:0%

numbers uh the there was a percentage of
 
00:37:25.190 --> 00:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
uh I assume salary that uh people would
 
00:37:27.710 --> 00:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
uh get in retirement Mass versus New
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what were those so to compare
 
00:37:33.829 --> 00:37:33.839 align:start position:0%
years of service uh 32 years of service
 
00:37:36.030 --> 00:37:36.040 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts to retire at 80% of
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
your salary in ma uh New Hampshire is
 
00:37:41.670 --> 00:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
50% uh I'm sorry 64% after the same

support of the house bill
 
00:38:53.710 --> 00:38:53.720 align:start position:0%
1647 uh but I'm not supporting the bill
 
00:38:55.309 --> 00:38:55.319 align:start position:0%
because the
 
00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
bill uh
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
is as as this bill is the only solution
 
00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:02.800 align:start position:0%
this bill is not the solution for the
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention issue we have
 
00:39:07.910 --> 00:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
in this state but rather it would take
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
the current members in much better
 
00:39:13.870 --> 00:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
avenues that where they are at um as you
 
00:39:16.589 --> 00:39:16.599 align:start position:0%
heard from the other group two law
 
00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers and firefighters
 
00:39:22.230 --> 00:39:22.240 align:start position:0%
our state is in a very compromised
 
00:39:26.470 --> 00:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
position where we're losing public
 
00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:30.400 align:start position:0%
service employees to other states we're
 
00:39:32.349 --> 00:39:32.359 align:start position:0%
losing them because we are not
 
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
compartible in a compartible
 
00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:37.520 align:start position:0%
market uh back in
 
00:39:40.910 --> 00:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
2012 the retirement system has changed
 
00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:43.680 align:start position:0%
Al questionable if it was necessary or
 
00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:46.200 align:start position:0%
not but the damage that has left is
 
00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200 align:start position:0%
impacting us every single day uh my
 
00:39:51.190 --> 00:39:51.200 align:start position:0%
agent my division is uh part of
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
Department of Correction as you all uh
 
00:39:57.109 --> 00:39:57.119 align:start position:0%
heard last year
 
00:40:01.349 --> 00:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
uh we are at 50% uh vacancy
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
rate uh we had the National Guard
 
00:40:08.510 --> 00:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
respond and cover post at the prison in
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
two different occasions last year and
 
00:40:13.109 --> 00:40:13.119 align:start position:0%
that situation has gotten worse not
 
00:40:16.870 --> 00:40:16.880 align:start position:0%
better so the challenge we're having is
 
00:40:19.430 --> 00:40:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's not only Recruitment and yes as
 
00:40:23.069 --> 00:40:23.079 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire indicated that
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
this is more of a retention Bill to keep
 
00:40:28.069 --> 00:40:28.079 align:start position:0%
those who are in the service so we don't
 
00:40:30.790 --> 00:40:30.800 align:start position:0%
lose them we're not recruiting I uh last
 
00:40:34.349 --> 00:40:34.359 align:start position:0%
year I had asked my students a question
 
00:40:36.349 --> 00:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
how many of them were prepared to join
 
00:40:37.950 --> 00:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
the public service here in the state of
 
00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire out of a large group of
 
00:40:42.550 --> 00:40:42.560 align:start position:0%
student I had two people who are willing
 
00:40:45.150 --> 00:40:45.160 align:start position:0%
to join the service in the state service
 
00:40:48.750 --> 00:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
so we're losing the young graduate from
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
college we're losing a season
 
00:40:52.710 --> 00:40:52.720 align:start position:0%
experienced officers who had actually
 
00:40:55.150 --> 00:40:55.160 align:start position:0%
work for this state because they have a
 
00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:57.520 align:start position:0%
bad taste in their mouth
 
00:41:00.230 --> 00:41:00.240 align:start position:0%
uh they're disheartened because we
 
00:41:01.910 --> 00:41:01.920 align:start position:0%
changed their condition of employment
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
after they were hired and served the
 
00:41:06.670 --> 00:41:06.680 align:start position:0%
state 9 years and 11 months because they
 
00:41:08.829 --> 00:41:08.839 align:start position:0%
didn't have 10 years they were not
 
00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:10.800 align:start position:0%
keeping what they were promised at the
 
00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:12.720 align:start position:0%
time of hire
 
00:41:17.630 --> 00:41:17.640 align:start position:0%
so uh I uh commend any bill that promote
 
00:41:19.829 --> 00:41:19.839 align:start position:0%
some form of change in the retirement
 
00:41:22.829 --> 00:41:22.839 align:start position:0%
we're not Computing we're not
 
00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:25.560 align:start position:0%
recruiting and I am concerned about the
 
00:41:29.030 --> 00:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
public safety in the future and uh I
 
00:41:31.390 --> 00:41:31.400 align:start position:0%
think this bill as uh representative
 
00:41:34.270 --> 00:41:34.280 align:start position:0%
Maguire stated that 436 was killed
 
00:41:36.390 --> 00:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
because it was expensive that is the
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
bill that I would like to see in the
 
00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:39.720 align:start position:0%
future and you'll continue to see me
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
coming here and testifying in any bill
 
00:41:44.190 --> 00:41:44.200 align:start position:0%
for any build to change the current
 
00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:46.720 align:start position:0%
conditions because it's unsafe it is a
 
00:41:49.950 --> 00:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
bad condition we are in but uh I will
 
00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
support the spill because it is a change
 
00:41:55.190 --> 00:41:55.200 align:start position:0%
and will be able to help us to retain uh
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
who we have
 
00:41:58.630 --> 00:41:58.640 align:start position:0%
with that I will take any question you
 
00:42:01.230 --> 00:42:01.240 align:start position:0%
may have for me thank you very much are
 
00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:03.680 align:start position:0%

00:42:06.230 --> 00:42:06.240 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any but thank you
 
00:42:09.309 --> 00:42:09.319 align:start position:0%

terms on for the record I'm

Representative Steve Pearson Rockingham
 
00:42:48.109 --> 00:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
District 13 in Dairy I'm a lieutenant
 
00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:49.640 align:start position:0%
with the city of Manchester fire
 
00:42:52.829 --> 00:42:52.839 align:start position:0%
department I'm a member of group two and
 
00:42:56.470 --> 00:42:56.480 align:start position:0%
I am a person who was caught up in this
 
00:42:58.829 --> 00:42:58.839 align:start position:0%
colossal mess in
 
00:43:01.230 --> 00:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
2011 just a couple things the the folks
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
that spoke before did an eloquent job
 
00:43:06.349 --> 00:43:06.359 align:start position:0%
they uh they covered pretty much the
 
00:43:08.309 --> 00:43:08.319 align:start position:0%
problem it's it's not a surprise now we
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
we've been talking about this for years
 
00:43:10.790 --> 00:43:10.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm not going to reiterate any of
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
that but I do just want to cover two
 
00:43:16.150 --> 00:43:16.160 align:start position:0%
things um so there's some
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
clarity and this is a repetitive part of
 
00:43:19.990 --> 00:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
what was said I want to make sure that
 
00:43:22.230 --> 00:43:22.240 align:start position:0%
you that is understood that this is a
 
00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:25.280 align:start position:0%
partial fix this is not the fix I
 
00:43:27.069 --> 00:43:27.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate that so far that is this has
 
00:43:29.430 --> 00:43:29.440 align:start position:0%
not been referred to as the fix but I
 
00:43:31.190 --> 00:43:31.200 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that that ver does not
 
00:43:32.790 --> 00:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
end up in the vernacular here because
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
that would not be an accurate
 
00:43:38.870 --> 00:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
statement one of the things
 
00:43:41.230 --> 00:43:41.240 align:start position:0%
that and I support
 
00:43:43.589 --> 00:43:43.599 align:start position:0%
1647 but I just want to point out two
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
things as as far as what this changes
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
the first one is the folks that were
 
00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:51.240 align:start position:0%
affected the most the folks that had
 
00:43:53.790 --> 00:43:53.800 align:start position:0%
eight nine 10 years into a career when
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
these changes occurred are actually
 
00:43:59.630 --> 00:43:59.640 align:start position:0%
going to benefit the least from this
 
00:44:03.349 --> 00:44:03.359 align:start position:0%
bill now we look at this
 
00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:07.280 align:start position:0%
holistically it's not always just about
 
00:44:09.470 --> 00:44:09.480 align:start position:0%
one group or another or
 
00:44:12.030 --> 00:44:12.040 align:start position:0%
about one group being pitted against
 
00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:13.559 align:start position:0%
another and that's why I support this
 
00:44:15.549 --> 00:44:15.559 align:start position:0%
legislation but I do want to point that
 
00:44:19.390 --> 00:44:19.400 align:start position:0%
part of it out the second thing is that
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
I don't want to see this bill
 
00:44:25.390 --> 00:44:25.400 align:start position:0%
miscategorized as something that was
 
00:44:27.510 --> 00:44:27.520 align:start position:0%
that will now retain people to work
 
00:44:30.510 --> 00:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
beyond their minimum Service
 
00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:32.680 align:start position:0%
retirement because this legislation just
 
00:44:34.630 --> 00:44:34.640 align:start position:0%
restores things back to the way they
 
00:44:38.109 --> 00:44:38.119 align:start position:0%
were it doesn't do anything beyond that
 
00:44:41.549 --> 00:44:41.559 align:start position:0%
and one of the factors here financially
 
00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
in the pension system is the longer an
 
00:44:45.750 --> 00:44:45.760 align:start position:0%
employee works the better it is for the
 
00:44:47.950 --> 00:44:47.960 align:start position:0%
system because that employee is now
 
00:44:49.549 --> 00:44:49.559 align:start position:0%
contributing out of their paycheck and
 
00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
not drawing a pension
 
00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:53.030 align:start position:0%
not drawing a pension
benefit

00:44:53.030 --> 00:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
benefit
 
00:44:55.430 --> 00:44:55.440 align:start position:0%
so I hope that we don't see this
 
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
categorized in any way as being
 
00:44:58.910 --> 00:44:58.920 align:start position:0%
something that incentivizes people to
 
00:45:01.510 --> 00:45:01.520 align:start position:0%
work longer we could have done that you
 
00:45:03.030 --> 00:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
and legislation could be brought forward
 
00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:05.400 align:start position:0%
to to incentivize and hang that carrot
 
00:45:07.309 --> 00:45:07.319 align:start position:0%
out there but that this is not it this
 
00:45:11.150 --> 00:45:11.160 align:start position:0%
just puts things back to where they
 
00:45:14.990 --> 00:45:15.000 align:start position:0%
were in as far as the multiplier Beyond
 
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
10 years and that's uh that's all I'm
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
going to touch on with this thank you
 
00:45:23.549 --> 00:45:23.559 align:start position:0%
you take some questions absolutely
 
00:45:23.559 --> 00:45:24.870 align:start position:0%
you take some questions absolutely
representative

00:45:24.870 --> 00:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:45:27.829 --> 00:45:27.839 align:start position:0%
sh thank you madam chair thank you
 
00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson um for your
 
00:45:33.190 --> 00:45:33.200 align:start position:0%
perspective on this I'm sure you're
 
00:45:35.829 --> 00:45:35.839 align:start position:0%
aware as this committee is aware that
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
the folks that you mentioned that had
 
00:45:42.349 --> 00:45:42.359 align:start position:0%
nine or 10 years of service in when the
 
00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:45.200 align:start position:0%
uh change occurred have now worked an
 
00:45:48.870 --> 00:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
additional 10 to 11 years and are
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
probably close to
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
retirement uh do you have any kind of
 
00:45:56.710 --> 00:45:56.720 align:start position:0%
idea how many of those folks are still
 
00:45:59.589 --> 00:45:59.599 align:start position:0%
on the job or have they just given up
 
00:46:01.990 --> 00:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
and left so so as far as a hard number
 
00:46:03.870 --> 00:46:03.880 align:start position:0%
that's something that would be better
 
00:46:05.390 --> 00:46:05.400 align:start position:0%
directed towards a retirement system
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
they they can provide you hard numbers
 
00:46:11.630 --> 00:46:11.640 align:start position:0%
but I can tell you that um we
 
00:46:14.069 --> 00:46:14.079 align:start position:0%
surprisingly have
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
seen folks leaving that have just gotten
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
to the point where they're not willing
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
to wait anymore because they've been
 
00:46:23.309 --> 00:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
asked to wait and give the legislature
 
00:46:26.710 --> 00:46:26.720 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to do its job
 
00:46:27.990 --> 00:46:28.000 align:start position:0%
and fix
 
00:46:30.430 --> 00:46:30.440 align:start position:0%
this and at some point they just they
 
00:46:32.270 --> 00:46:32.280 align:start position:0%
can't wait any longer and they have to
 
00:46:34.069 --> 00:46:34.079 align:start position:0%
go now
 
00:46:36.270 --> 00:46:36.280 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the with the way things
 
00:46:38.870 --> 00:46:38.880 align:start position:0%
work is when you retire in the New
 
00:46:40.230 --> 00:46:40.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system your pension
 
00:46:43.750 --> 00:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
is set that's it so to make a a fix for
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
someone that retired last
 
00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
month they're they're out you know that
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
barring a a
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
constitutional violation you're not
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
going to see any retroactive changes so
 
00:46:57.630 --> 00:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
so that we have seen that we have seen
 
00:47:00.230 --> 00:47:00.240 align:start position:0%
folks that have have held on a little
 
00:47:01.470 --> 00:47:01.480 align:start position:0%
bit longer especially on the law
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
enforcement side and have just finally
 
00:47:05.950 --> 00:47:05.960 align:start position:0%
worn out frankly this is these jobs are
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
very physically demanding and and they
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
just can't
 
00:47:12.549 --> 00:47:12.559 align:start position:0%
continue I will mention that of the
 
00:47:16.190 --> 00:47:16.200 align:start position:0%
bills in question the affected
 
00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:20.839 align:start position:0%
group is has gone down from 1800 and
 
00:47:24.190 --> 00:47:24.200 align:start position:0%
some odd to 1650 or so over the course
 
00:47:26.549 --> 00:47:26.559 align:start position:0%
of this session so
 
00:47:29.349 --> 00:47:29.359 align:start position:0%
there these people are eligible to
 
00:47:31.710 --> 00:47:31.720 align:start position:0%
retire and many of them are choosing to
 
00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400 align:start position:0%
do so so the only other thing I'd like
 
00:47:36.549 --> 00:47:36.559 align:start position:0%
to say Madam chair you were the the
 
00:47:41.150 --> 00:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
chair of the of the um commission um the
 
00:47:43.270 --> 00:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
only the only thing I would I'd like to
 
00:47:44.510 --> 00:47:44.520 align:start position:0%
address there is I would have liked to
 
00:47:46.950 --> 00:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
seen opportunity for that commission to
 
00:47:49.870 --> 00:47:49.880 align:start position:0%
take some testimony from the
 
00:47:52.230 --> 00:47:52.240 align:start position:0%
public we which which just didn't Happ
 
00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:53.760 align:start position:0%
yes I understand that you mentioned it
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
at the time I thought we had enough
 
00:47:57.829 --> 00:47:57.839 align:start position:0%
representatives of the public on the
 
00:47:59.910 --> 00:47:59.920 align:start position:0%
commission that that might not have been
 
00:48:02.870 --> 00:48:02.880 align:start position:0%
as NE as necessary as it is in the
 
00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
legislature so that's that's you know I
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
like I said I do appreciate the
 
00:48:08.710 --> 00:48:08.720 align:start position:0%
commission's work on this I was I had
 
00:48:10.990 --> 00:48:11.000 align:start position:0%
attended a fair number and and took
 
00:48:12.069 --> 00:48:12.079 align:start position:0%
advantage of the opportunity of
 
00:48:14.030 --> 00:48:14.040 align:start position:0%
technology that we have today to to
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
watch the rest of them remotely
 
00:48:18.349 --> 00:48:18.359 align:start position:0%
so all right thank you very much for
 
00:48:20.630 --> 00:48:20.640 align:start position:0%
your testimony any other
 
00:48:23.150 --> 00:48:23.160 align:start position:0%
questions thank you is there anyone else
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%

everyone said especially following uh
 
00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:07.640 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson but I just want

to um Express the plle officers and uh I
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
can't speak for the Corrections Officers

officers support this bill it's a step
 
00:49:27.470 --> 00:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
in the right direction I think uh 436
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
last year was the fix but this is
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
definitely the uh step in the right
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
direction thank you thank you any
 
00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:38.240 align:start position:0%

thank you for recog out recognizing us
 
00:52:10.870 --> 00:52:10.880 align:start position:0%
out in the crowd there um
 
00:52:15.190 --> 00:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
1653 as presented is uh well let me just
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
speak earlier how we talked about
 
00:52:21.069 --> 00:52:21.079 align:start position:0%
1647 and uh as everybody knows I think
 
00:52:22.990 --> 00:52:23.000 align:start position:0%
in this room that uh the changes that
 
00:52:27.510 --> 00:52:27.520 align:start position:0%
were made in 200 uh1 and 11 was made and
 
00:52:29.349 --> 00:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
there was seven different things that
 
00:52:30.789 --> 00:52:30.799 align:start position:0%
were changed to the people that were
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
already working uh I'm in favor of 1647
 
00:52:37.230 --> 00:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
I know I not supposed to talk about that
 
00:52:40.109 --> 00:52:40.119 align:start position:0%
now but that did fix part of the problem
 
00:52:42.230 --> 00:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
uh now we're talking about uh these two
 
00:52:44.309 --> 00:52:44.319 align:start position:0%
new bills
 
00:52:46.990 --> 00:52:47.000 align:start position:0%
1653 also takes care of one piece of
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
that um seven changes that were made
 
00:52:52.270 --> 00:52:52.280 align:start position:0%
back 10 years ago 11 years
 
00:52:54.870 --> 00:52:54.880 align:start position:0%
ago want to go into detail I can go into
 
00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:56.190 align:start position:0%
ago want to go into detail I can go into
detail

00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
detail
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
sure detail I'm the detail guy I guess
 
00:53:00.670 --> 00:53:00.680 align:start position:0%
so specifically what this does is it
 
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:02.680 align:start position:0%
separates out group one and group two as
 
00:53:04.750 --> 00:53:04.760 align:start position:0%
far as the as far as the earnable
 
00:53:07.829 --> 00:53:07.839 align:start position:0%
compensation definition the definition
 
00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
uh used to exist the same for both
 
00:53:14.589 --> 00:53:14.599 align:start position:0%
groups and what we found in the early
 
00:53:19.309 --> 00:53:19.319 align:start position:0%
stages of 436 last year was that uh
 
00:53:21.990 --> 00:53:22.000 align:start position:0%
there were some unintended consequences
 
00:53:24.710 --> 00:53:24.720 align:start position:0%
when when that bill in its original
 
00:53:28.309 --> 00:53:28.319 align:start position:0%
incarn was brought forward um as it made
 
00:53:31.069 --> 00:53:31.079 align:start position:0%
changes to a group that we did not
 
00:53:32.430 --> 00:53:32.440 align:start position:0%
intend to
 
00:53:37.270 --> 00:53:37.280 align:start position:0%
change so in order to properly do that
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
within the the definition section of RSA
 
00:53:45.150 --> 00:53:45.160 align:start position:0%
100a you would have to separate this out
 
00:53:47.309 --> 00:53:47.319 align:start position:0%
now of course when you look at a bill
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
everything that's in bold is
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
new so I want to go over what's actually
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
new and what's actually just not just a
 
00:53:55.870 --> 00:53:55.880 align:start position:0%
repeat right because it's created a new
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
paragraph but it's verbatim language
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
with the
 
00:54:02.870 --> 00:54:02.880 align:start position:0%
exception of line 20 and 21 that is the
 
00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:04.630 align:start position:0%
exception of line 20 and 21 that is the
only

00:54:04.630 --> 00:54:04.640 align:start position:0%
only
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
difference everything else is the same
 
00:54:09.750 --> 00:54:09.760 align:start position:0%
as it exists under current law so line
 
00:54:13.710 --> 00:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 what that does is it
 
00:54:13.720 --> 00:54:15.270 align:start position:0%
20 and 21 what that does is it
says

00:54:15.270 --> 00:54:15.280 align:start position:0%
says
 
00:54:18.190 --> 00:54:18.200 align:start position:0%
that any member hired before July 1 of
 
00:54:20.510 --> 00:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
2011 which was sort of that Line in the
 
00:54:24.470 --> 00:54:24.480 align:start position:0%
Sand that that we have for uh changes
 
00:54:25.710 --> 00:54:25.720 align:start position:0%
for the most part
 
00:54:27.390 --> 00:54:27.400 align:start position:0%
shall have their overtime pay included
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
as their base pay that is what the law
 
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:33.240 align:start position:0%
stated when they were hired we had a
 
00:54:34.950 --> 00:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
very simple calculation in those days
 
00:54:37.309 --> 00:54:37.319 align:start position:0%
you could actually do it on a postcard
 
00:54:40.309 --> 00:54:40.319 align:start position:0%
it was a it was a conglomeration of the
 
00:54:44.349 --> 00:54:44.359 align:start position:0%
various aspects of your of your J salary
 
00:54:44.359 --> 00:54:45.230 align:start position:0%
various aspects of your of your J salary
your

00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:54:48.109 --> 00:54:48.119 align:start position:0%
overtime detail pay if that was
 
00:54:49.910 --> 00:54:49.920 align:start position:0%
something that was involved in in your
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
profession in group two and they simply
 
00:54:53.789 --> 00:54:53.799 align:start position:0%
added that up and divided by three it
 
00:54:56.270 --> 00:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
was it was fairly simple
 
00:54:58.510 --> 00:54:58.520 align:start position:0%
so when that started to get chopped up
 
00:55:01.109 --> 00:55:01.119 align:start position:0%
and moved and some things were removed
 
00:55:04.349 --> 00:55:04.359 align:start position:0%
and the legislature decided to to look
 
00:55:05.789 --> 00:55:05.799 align:start position:0%
at some of the aspects of what was
 
00:55:07.270 --> 00:55:07.280 align:start position:0%
included and not
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
included that became a more complicated
 
00:55:12.270 --> 00:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
formula so what this does is it
 
00:55:14.950 --> 00:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
basically takes overtime pay and just
 
00:55:18.430 --> 00:55:18.440 align:start position:0%
overtime pay not detail pay not no
 
00:55:21.230 --> 00:55:21.240 align:start position:0%
incentives no other type of pay just
 
00:55:23.950 --> 00:55:23.960 align:start position:0%
overtime pay and brings it back into
 
00:55:25.510 --> 00:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
base salary
 
00:55:27.589 --> 00:55:27.599 align:start position:0%
so when you're working
 
00:55:30.270 --> 00:55:30.280 align:start position:0%
overtime and and it's kind of funny to
 
00:55:32.029 --> 00:55:32.039 align:start position:0%
to think of it in this terms but if I'm
 
00:55:33.549 --> 00:55:33.559 align:start position:0%
if I'm working a shift on Tuesday and
 
00:55:36.109 --> 00:55:36.119 align:start position:0%
it's my regular
 
00:55:38.109 --> 00:55:38.119 align:start position:0%
shift that
 
00:55:41.470 --> 00:55:41.480 align:start position:0%
becomes the base pay of my pension
 
00:55:43.710 --> 00:55:43.720 align:start position:0%
calculation but if I work on
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
Wednesday because we have a vacancy and
 
00:55:48.270 --> 00:55:48.280 align:start position:0%
they need someone I'm doing the exact
 
00:55:51.150 --> 00:55:51.160 align:start position:0%
same job doing the exact same thing that
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
is now treated
 
00:55:55.789 --> 00:55:55.799 align:start position:0%
differently and I the pecul famar it of
 
00:55:58.789 --> 00:55:58.799 align:start position:0%
that is is something that causes most
 
00:56:01.390 --> 00:56:01.400 align:start position:0%
people to to raise an eyebrow and to try
 
00:56:03.589 --> 00:56:03.599 align:start position:0%
to understand how when I did the exact
 
00:56:05.589 --> 00:56:05.599 align:start position:0%
same thing I did yesterday it's not
 
00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
treated the same way now
 
00:56:12.069 --> 00:56:12.079 align:start position:0%
overtime in the past has been somewhat
 
00:56:13.630 --> 00:56:13.640 align:start position:0%
of a well at one point it was a dirty
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
word in municipalities but the reality
 
00:56:17.990 --> 00:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
of today is that the the total
 
00:56:19.870 --> 00:56:19.880 align:start position:0%
compensation package that's given to a
 
00:56:22.349 --> 00:56:22.359 align:start position:0%
Municipal Employee is broken up between
 
00:56:24.309 --> 00:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
a salary and and the benefit part of it
 
00:56:25.510 --> 00:56:25.520 align:start position:0%
the benefit part of that has now
 
00:56:27.789 --> 00:56:27.799 align:start position:0%
exceeded the salary part unfortunately
 
00:56:29.829 --> 00:56:29.839 align:start position:0%
due to healthare costs and and other
 
00:56:31.589 --> 00:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
things so what you're seeing now is
 
00:56:32.990 --> 00:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
you're seeing an increase use of
 
00:56:35.549 --> 00:56:35.559 align:start position:0%
overtime because it's actually cheaper
 
00:56:37.710 --> 00:56:37.720 align:start position:0%
for the municipality to fill a shift on
 
00:56:39.630 --> 00:56:39.640 align:start position:0%
a fairly regular basis with overtime
 
00:56:41.910 --> 00:56:41.920 align:start position:0%
than it is to hire another human who now
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
has to get dental benefits and health
 
00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
benefits and vacation time and all of
 
00:56:48.270 --> 00:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
that that that's a phenomenon that's
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
relatively recent so as we move forward
 
00:56:54.430 --> 00:56:54.440 align:start position:0%
and we see this this being used as a
 
00:56:54.440 --> 00:56:56.470 align:start position:0%
and we see this this being used as a
costs

00:56:56.470 --> 00:56:56.480 align:start position:0%
costs
 
00:56:58.789 --> 00:56:58.799 align:start position:0%
measure in some
 
00:57:01.549 --> 00:57:01.559 align:start position:0%
cases let's let's kind of scale this
 
00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:03.200 align:start position:0%
back and say okay if that's really how
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
how things are going and and we're
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
asking these people to do the same exact
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
job on Wednesday they did on Tuesday
 
00:57:10.750 --> 00:57:10.760 align:start position:0%
should that not just be treated the same
 
00:57:12.390 --> 00:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's the the concept and the
 
00:57:15.630 --> 00:57:15.640 align:start position:0%
premise of this idea um
 
00:57:18.150 --> 00:57:18.160 align:start position:0%
and like I said despite all the the
 
00:57:20.309 --> 00:57:20.319 align:start position:0%
boldface type literally the difference
 
00:57:22.430 --> 00:57:22.440 align:start position:0%
is lines 20 and
 
00:57:25.190 --> 00:57:25.200 align:start position:0%
21 thank you representative Pearson
 
00:57:27.430 --> 00:57:27.440 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and then
 
00:57:31.230 --> 00:57:31.240 align:start position:0%
laus thank you madam chair morning
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
representative so when you're giving an
 
00:57:36.870 --> 00:57:36.880 align:start position:0%
exam the the example you gave you're not
 
00:57:39.150 --> 00:57:39.160 align:start position:0%
talking about that your regular job is
 
00:57:41.829 --> 00:57:41.839 align:start position:0%
on Tuesday and occasionally you're doing
 
00:57:46.510 --> 00:57:46.520 align:start position:0%
the same job filling in for a needed uh
 
00:57:49.589 --> 00:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
shift on Wednesday this week you're
 
00:57:53.829 --> 00:57:53.839 align:start position:0%
talking about every week not or what is
 
00:57:56.069 --> 00:57:56.079 align:start position:0%
the exact situation so in the sense of
 
00:57:59.829 --> 00:57:59.839 align:start position:0%
you know when overtime opportunities for
 
00:58:01.789 --> 00:58:01.799 align:start position:0%
for most agencies are are done in a fair
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
and Equitable way so I may not be able
 
00:58:06.190 --> 00:58:06.200 align:start position:0%
to work Wednesday I may be up here but
 
00:58:08.670 --> 00:58:08.680 align:start position:0%
someone else is going to be given the
 
00:58:10.549 --> 00:58:10.559 align:start position:0%
opportunity to fill that necessary shift
 
00:58:13.950 --> 00:58:13.960 align:start position:0%
in so it's not it's it's not that it's a
 
00:58:17.270 --> 00:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a predictable and constant
 
00:58:20.150 --> 00:58:20.160 align:start position:0%
thing um it may be a constant thing in
 
00:58:21.910 --> 00:58:21.920 align:start position:0%
the sense of the of them using that
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
tactic to to lower cost for that shift
 
00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:26.680 align:start position:0%
but those that fill that in would be
 
00:58:28.829 --> 00:58:28.839 align:start position:0%
would be taken from a pool and and
 
00:58:31.309 --> 00:58:31.319 align:start position:0%
that's equitably discharged so that it
 
00:58:32.589 --> 00:58:32.599 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a single person that would
 
00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:39.390 --> 00:58:39.400 align:start position:0%
that followup but if they're doing it
 
00:58:42.069 --> 00:58:42.079 align:start position:0%
effectively every week not necessarily
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
with you sometimes it's with your
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
colleague there or another one of the
 
00:58:51.190 --> 00:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
employees uh but there but that opening
 
00:58:54.470 --> 00:58:54.480 align:start position:0%
is there every week and until they and
 
00:58:58.109 --> 00:58:58.119 align:start position:0%
are is the um municipality trying to
 
00:59:00.750 --> 00:59:00.760 align:start position:0%
hire somebody to F to permanently fill
 
00:59:02.990 --> 00:59:03.000 align:start position:0%
that slot they just can't so they're
 
00:59:05.349 --> 00:59:05.359 align:start position:0%
using you this week and somebody else
 
00:59:07.750 --> 00:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
two weeks down and so forth sure you'll
 
00:59:10.510 --> 00:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
see that in both ways you you'll see the
 
00:59:13.230 --> 00:59:13.240 align:start position:0%
the the tactic of delaying bringing on a
 
00:59:15.910 --> 00:59:15.920 align:start position:0%
full-time person to to lower costs in
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
the short term and in some cases they're
 
00:59:21.789 --> 00:59:21.799 align:start position:0%
begging literally begging for someone to
 
00:59:24.230 --> 00:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
fill that slot and they can't find them
 
00:59:27.390 --> 00:59:27.400 align:start position:0%
follow and and the uh and this the cost
 
00:59:29.430 --> 00:59:29.440 align:start position:0%
savings is not in the salary because
 
00:59:31.630 --> 00:59:31.640 align:start position:0%
they're paying somebody to do that the
 
00:59:34.630 --> 00:59:34.640 align:start position:0%
cost savings is the benefits that don't
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
have to be expanded in terms of the cost
 
00:59:39.630 --> 00:59:39.640 align:start position:0%
to the municipality correct a a person
 
00:59:40.950 --> 00:59:40.960 align:start position:0%
that works an overtime shift doesn't get
 
00:59:42.589 --> 00:59:42.599 align:start position:0%
extra Dental right you know what I mean
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
they don't get the one one more Crown
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
issue to them in the course of their
 
00:59:48.710 --> 00:59:48.720 align:start position:0%
their time those things are fairly
 
00:59:50.430 --> 00:59:50.440 align:start position:0%
fairly fixed to the person so that
 
00:59:52.670 --> 00:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
that's where you see substantial savings
 
00:59:54.230 --> 00:59:54.240 align:start position:0%
good are you going to be available for
 
00:59:57.069 --> 00:59:57.079 align:start position:0%
the sub committee as well try thank you
 
00:59:59.910 --> 00:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
representative laus thank you so um I'm
 
01:00:01.990 --> 01:00:02.000 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the effect of this
 
01:00:04.829 --> 01:00:04.839 align:start position:0%
you're talking about uh people now who
 
01:00:06.750 --> 01:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
have to work overtime and they have
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
questions about why that overtime isn't
 
01:00:11.190 --> 01:00:11.200 align:start position:0%
included in their uh pension
 
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
calculations but the two lines you
 
01:00:15.990 --> 01:00:16.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh say it appears to only
 
01:00:19.510 --> 01:00:19.520 align:start position:0%
affect members hired before July 1 2011
 
01:00:21.829 --> 01:00:21.839 align:start position:0%
that is correct so are let's say
 
01:00:23.870 --> 01:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
somebody's hired you know a year was
 
01:00:26.309 --> 01:00:26.319 align:start position:0%
hired a year ago MH are they currently
 
01:00:28.789 --> 01:00:28.799 align:start position:0%
getting um their overtime included in
 
01:00:31.510 --> 01:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
their pension they are but it is
 
01:00:34.150 --> 01:00:34.160 align:start position:0%
calculated in a much different
 
01:00:36.430 --> 01:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
manner now I I've I've stated this in
 
01:00:38.270 --> 01:00:38.280 align:start position:0%
front of Edna many times the legislature
 
01:00:39.270 --> 01:00:39.280 align:start position:0%
has the
 
01:00:41.829 --> 01:00:41.839 align:start position:0%
right and I will defend that right to
 
01:00:43.870 --> 01:00:43.880 align:start position:0%
modify the system for new
 
01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:47.720 align:start position:0%
hires right so what what I what I argue
 
01:00:50.109 --> 01:00:50.119 align:start position:0%
that this legislature cannot do is
 
01:00:52.270 --> 01:00:52.280 align:start position:0%
retroactively modify things and that's
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
what this fixes is the folks who who
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
were retroactively
 
01:01:00.990 --> 01:01:01.000 align:start position:0%
altered uh followup followup so if I
 
01:01:03.069 --> 01:01:03.079 align:start position:0%
understand correctly this isn't going
 
01:01:06.630 --> 01:01:06.640 align:start position:0%
to affect anybody who's working now
 
01:01:09.190 --> 01:01:09.200 align:start position:0%
unless they were hired before their date
 
01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:11.799 align:start position:0%
that's correct and um and you said it's
 
01:01:13.910 --> 01:01:13.920 align:start position:0%
it's handled very differently so how is
 
01:01:16.069 --> 01:01:16.079 align:start position:0%
overtime pay handled as far as
 
01:01:17.910 --> 01:01:17.920 align:start position:0%
Retirement currently so if you were
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
hired today what they would do is they
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
would run that over your entire career
 
01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:25.640 align:start position:0%
so if you did a for easy math a 20-year
 
01:01:27.349 --> 01:01:27.359 align:start position:0%
career actually you can't do a 20 I
 
01:01:29.029 --> 01:01:29.039 align:start position:0%
would even say that you can't even do a
 
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
20-year career right now so a 30-year
 
01:01:36.029 --> 01:01:36.039 align:start position:0%
career which is which will be is the
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
becoming the average for the Young Folks
 
01:01:40.309 --> 01:01:40.319 align:start position:0%
now if you do a 30-year career they will
 
01:01:43.829 --> 01:01:43.839 align:start position:0%
take the the entire run of your overtime
 
01:01:46.549 --> 01:01:46.559 align:start position:0%
over that 30 years and then run it
 
01:01:48.670 --> 01:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
through a
 
01:01:52.630 --> 01:01:52.640 align:start position:0%
formula which is I suppose fantastic if
 
01:01:56.990 --> 01:01:57.000 align:start position:0%
you don't get deployed it's yes the it's
 
01:02:00.190 --> 01:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
a fairly complex calculation that is
 
01:02:02.589 --> 01:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
designed to not penalize people who
 
01:02:04.910 --> 01:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
consistently work overtime and some
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
people do but not allow individuals to
 
01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:10.200 align:start position:0%
work a lot of overtime in their last few
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
years to artificially bump up their
 
01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
salary which which under under this
 
01:02:16.829 --> 01:02:16.839 align:start position:0%
would be extraordinarily difficult to do
 
01:02:21.069 --> 01:02:21.079 align:start position:0%
because that average is a under in that
 
01:02:23.029 --> 01:02:23.039 align:start position:0%
retroactively done in 2009 is a
 
01:02:25.390 --> 01:02:25.400 align:start position:0%
seven-year average you can't just hit
 
01:02:27.910 --> 01:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
the street for one year and overly
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
inflate this is this is done over a
 
01:02:32.670 --> 01:02:32.680 align:start position:0%
seven-year average anyway all right
 
01:02:34.870 --> 01:02:34.880 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative O'Brien
 
01:02:37.950 --> 01:02:37.960 align:start position:0%
you had a question uh thank you um Madam
 
01:02:39.910 --> 01:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
chair and I'm going to attempt just to
 
01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.069 align:start position:0%
chair and I'm going to attempt just to
help

01:02:41.069 --> 01:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
clarify for some of the new people uh
 
01:02:48.549 --> 01:02:48.559 align:start position:0%
some of within a lot of the
 
01:02:51.470 --> 01:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
overtime and I hate using the term
 
01:02:53.950 --> 01:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
overtime because in a lot of communities
 
01:02:56.750 --> 01:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
it's not not it's actually natural we
 
01:02:58.670 --> 01:02:58.680 align:start position:0%
affectionally call it like shift
 
01:03:01.750 --> 01:03:01.760 align:start position:0%
coverage because it's not time and a
 
01:03:04.470 --> 01:03:04.480 align:start position:0%
half and that's because of the Garcia
 
01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
decision and we could discuss that at a
 
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
later date but the thing is by certain
 
01:03:12.309 --> 01:03:12.319 align:start position:0%
type of communities you sign the list
 
01:03:15.029 --> 01:03:15.039 align:start position:0%
you get the overtime it's your
 
01:03:17.950 --> 01:03:17.960 align:start position:0%
responsibility to get a replacement to
 
01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
do it it it's not uh like you say no
 
01:03:24.630 --> 01:03:24.640 align:start position:0%
refusal so in other words you get for
 
01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
Christmas day you're working baby you
 
01:03:30.829 --> 01:03:30.839 align:start position:0%
know and uh so is that true in a lot of
 
01:03:32.589 --> 01:03:32.599 align:start position:0%
the communities
 
01:03:35.470 --> 01:03:35.480 align:start position:0%
here the city of Nashua which is what
 
01:03:37.470 --> 01:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
you're referring to because I recognize
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
that that
 
01:03:43.549 --> 01:03:43.559 align:start position:0%
operational method that Nasa uses um is
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
not standardized
 
01:03:48.630 --> 01:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
Statewide there is no Statewide standard
 
01:03:50.349 --> 01:03:50.359 align:start position:0%
I can tell you as an example in the city
 
01:03:53.789 --> 01:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
of Manchester it's simply done using a a
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
third party contractor that tracks hours
 
01:03:59.789 --> 01:03:59.799 align:start position:0%
and he who hath the least or she we have
 
01:04:03.029 --> 01:04:03.039 align:start position:0%
SE several females on mest fire he he or
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
she who hath the least gets the first
 
01:04:06.789 --> 01:04:06.799 align:start position:0%
opportunity that is done so it's an
 
01:04:09.910 --> 01:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
inequitable way and it also prevents a
 
01:04:13.510 --> 01:04:13.520 align:start position:0%
single individual from cranking up their
 
01:04:18.069 --> 01:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
overtime because it is distributed
 
01:04:20.829 --> 01:04:20.839 align:start position:0%
equitably that is a spiking protection
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
that the city of Manchester
 
01:04:26.510 --> 01:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
uses thank you representative
 
01:04:29.789 --> 01:04:29.799 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair um the bill
 
01:04:32.349 --> 01:04:32.359 align:start position:0%
as it's written doesn't appear to me to
 
01:04:35.230 --> 01:04:35.240 align:start position:0%
have spiking protection in it does it
 
01:04:36.670 --> 01:04:36.680 align:start position:0%
because when I'm looking at this in
 
01:04:37.870 --> 01:04:37.880 align:start position:0%
comparison with some of the other bills
 
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
that are being brought forward for
 
01:04:42.870 --> 01:04:42.880 align:start position:0%
example if we were to pass 1647 and 1653
 
01:04:45.150 --> 01:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
1653 is going to have a pretty
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
substantial impact potentially on the
 
01:04:49.670 --> 01:04:49.680 align:start position:0%
calculations of 1647 if I'm reading that
 
01:04:51.750 --> 01:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
correctly because you're dealing with
 
01:04:53.230 --> 01:04:53.240 align:start position:0%
actually changing the base pay of an
 
01:04:55.750 --> 01:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
employee but where as there are those
 
01:04:58.630 --> 01:04:58.640 align:start position:0%
complicated calculations in the
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
retirement system for most employees
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
this doesn't seem to have any of those
 
01:05:03.910 --> 01:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
safeguards in it so the safeguards are
 
01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:07.000 align:start position:0%
already in law this doesn't remove any
 
01:05:08.950 --> 01:05:08.960 align:start position:0%
of the safeguards that are that are in
 
01:05:12.029 --> 01:05:12.039 align:start position:0%
the statute now so it's not
 
01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:14.520 align:start position:0%
necessary to have it in this particular
 
01:05:16.789 --> 01:05:16.799 align:start position:0%
bill because they already
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
exist follow up follow up that's not
 
01:05:22.789 --> 01:05:22.799 align:start position:0%
what the language says though it I mean
 
01:05:24.910 --> 01:05:24.920 align:start position:0%
it would it's already in statute and
 
01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:26.440 align:start position:0%
this bill is not changing it this bill
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't change would be in the
 
01:05:30.630 --> 01:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
bill right I mean and maybe I'm just
 
01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding forgive me if I am but
 
01:05:35.109 --> 01:05:35.119 align:start position:0%
because the wording is overtime pay
 
01:05:37.789 --> 01:05:37.799 align:start position:0%
included as base pay
 
01:05:39.950 --> 01:05:39.960 align:start position:0%
correct would that not create then if
 
01:05:41.829 --> 01:05:41.839 align:start position:0%
it's not replacing it wouldn't it create
 
01:05:43.750 --> 01:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
a conflict in the language of Statute
 
01:05:45.309 --> 01:05:45.319 align:start position:0%
because that's not what we do we don't
 
01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:49.960 align:start position:0%
include all overtime pay as base pay we
 
01:05:53.630 --> 01:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
have so what this would do is it makes
 
01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:55.520 align:start position:0%
it stores
 
01:05:59.470 --> 01:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
that calculation back down into how base
 
01:06:01.870 --> 01:06:01.880 align:start position:0%
pay is calculated which is a fiveyear
 
01:06:04.589 --> 01:06:04.599 align:start position:0%
average right yeah no I understand that
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
component of
 
01:06:08.109 --> 01:06:08.119 align:start position:0%
it all right I'll I'll think about it a
 
01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:12.480 align:start position:0%
little bit more okay are there any other
 
01:06:14.430 --> 01:06:14.440 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you very much for
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.430 align:start position:0%
 
Carlin

01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
Carlin
 
01:06:26.630 --> 01:06:26.640 align:start position:0%
if it's not changed it doesn't
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:33.950 --> 01:06:33.960 align:start position:0%
to but notes to look at in
 
01:06:36.750 --> 01:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
subit thanks again Madam chair again for
 
01:06:38.789 --> 01:06:38.799 align:start position:0%
the record Marty Carlin representing
 
01:06:40.349 --> 01:06:40.359 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire retirement
 
01:06:42.750 --> 01:06:42.760 align:start position:0%
system uh we do not have a position on
 
01:06:47.390 --> 01:06:47.400 align:start position:0%
this bill um the first bill we heard
 
01:06:49.309 --> 01:06:49.319 align:start position:0%
today you know if we were you know if
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
this was a physics class would be sort
 
01:06:52.510 --> 01:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
of how neutrons and protons and
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
electrons interact these next two bills
 
01:06:58.470 --> 01:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
are more like particle you know physics
 
01:07:00.910 --> 01:07:00.920 align:start position:0%
you know with you know all the Exotic
 
01:07:02.789 --> 01:07:02.799 align:start position:0%
particles that go into those building
 
01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:04.720 align:start position:0%
blocks there's a lot here to unpack so
 
01:07:05.990 --> 01:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
I'm going to back up a little and just
 
01:07:07.710 --> 01:07:07.720 align:start position:0%
kind of talk about comp over base and
 
01:07:10.029 --> 01:07:10.039 align:start position:0%
Aral compensation because it will also
 
01:07:12.390 --> 01:07:12.400 align:start position:0%
apply uh for the discussion on the
 
01:07:18.069 --> 01:07:18.079 align:start position:0%
following bill this morning 16 uh 53 73
 
01:07:21.750 --> 01:07:21.760 align:start position:0%
um so essentially prior to uh the
 
01:07:24.549 --> 01:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
changes in 2011 uh
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
U legislate there were enumerated types
 
01:07:29.829 --> 01:07:29.839 align:start position:0%
of pay in our statute base pay
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
overtime differentials Etc and
 
01:07:35.789 --> 01:07:35.799 align:start position:0%
everything was if it was listed in the
 
01:07:38.190 --> 01:07:38.200 align:start position:0%
statute as a compensation type that was
 
01:07:40.230 --> 01:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
earnable compensation it was all
 
01:07:43.390 --> 01:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
considered base pay uh by nhrs and the
 
01:07:45.510 --> 01:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
pension was averaged out on that that
 
01:07:47.309 --> 01:07:47.319 align:start position:0%
total those total amounts and that's how
 
01:07:50.269 --> 01:07:50.279 align:start position:0%
the AFC was determined uh employers
 
01:07:53.109 --> 01:07:53.119 align:start position:0%
reported it all in one line you know uh
 
01:07:54.870 --> 01:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
for individual so we never had a
 
01:07:57.710 --> 01:07:57.720 align:start position:0%
breakdown of what what was going into
 
01:08:00.069 --> 01:08:00.079 align:start position:0%
the to being what was reported uh in
 
01:08:03.630 --> 01:08:03.640 align:start position:0%
2011 the law changed for uh tier B
 
01:08:06.190 --> 01:08:06.200 align:start position:0%
members and future hires uh so that
 
01:08:08.950 --> 01:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
there was a new definition of of base
 
01:08:10.950 --> 01:08:10.960 align:start position:0%
pay which is as defined by the employer
 
01:08:11.870 --> 01:08:11.880 align:start position:0%
that's you know what's on your
 
01:08:14.549 --> 01:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
contractor you know on your salary band
 
01:08:18.229 --> 01:08:18.239 align:start position:0%
uh and compensation over base among the
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
things that could be included in
 
01:08:21.510 --> 01:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
compensation over base and this is for
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
all members including Rec in future
 
01:08:26.070 --> 01:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
hires is
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
overtime uh attendance bonuses or
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
stipend uh workers compensation
 
01:08:33.870 --> 01:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
supplemental pay paid by the employer if
 
01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
if they offered that longevity pay uh
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
and for tib only in group two extra or
 
01:08:43.470 --> 01:08:43.480 align:start position:0%
special duty pay Cally known as detail
 
01:08:46.669 --> 01:08:46.679 align:start position:0%
pay so those are the pieces that go into
 
01:08:49.870 --> 01:08:49.880 align:start position:0%
comp over base so uh beginning with
 
01:08:51.229 --> 01:08:51.239 align:start position:0%
January of
 
01:08:53.829 --> 01:08:53.839 align:start position:0%
2012 uh employers were instructed to
 
01:08:57.189 --> 01:08:57.199 align:start position:0%
begin reporting NH to
 
01:09:00.590 --> 01:09:00.600 align:start position:0%
nhrs base pay compensation over base pay
 
01:09:03.149 --> 01:09:03.159 align:start position:0%
and then also detail pay separately
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
because it applies differently for for
 
01:09:07.229 --> 01:09:07.239 align:start position:0%
TR so they basically instead of having
 
01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
one bottom line salary number reported
 
01:09:12.189 --> 01:09:12.199 align:start position:0%
every month for an individual there
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
there were up to three components uh
 
01:09:17.789 --> 01:09:17.799 align:start position:0%
that went into that bottom line so um
 
01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:20.799 align:start position:0%
any calculations regarding compensation
 
01:09:23.110 --> 01:09:23.120 align:start position:0%
Overbay or offsets things like that are
 
01:09:26.630 --> 01:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
only based on salary earned after one
 
01:09:29.590 --> 01:09:29.600 align:start position:0%
one of 12 if somebody everything was
 
01:09:32.309 --> 01:09:32.319 align:start position:0%
base pay before then essentially
 
01:09:37.189 --> 01:09:37.199 align:start position:0%
so and what what the law did in 2011 is
 
01:09:42.070 --> 01:09:42.080 align:start position:0%
it assigned a a a cap um on compensation
 
01:09:43.630 --> 01:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
over base pay and this this is where it
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
gets a little complicated basically it
 
01:09:48.189 --> 01:09:48.199 align:start position:0%
says take
 
01:09:51.309 --> 01:09:51.319 align:start position:0%
the find the five highest years salary
 
01:09:53.910 --> 01:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
for that person and then look at in
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
those 5 years what percentage of that
 
01:09:59.030 --> 01:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
compensation was compensation over base
 
01:10:03.270 --> 01:10:03.280 align:start position:0%
pay versus base pay so um round number
 
01:10:05.750 --> 01:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
you know if you had a $50,000 base and
 
01:10:09.390 --> 01:10:09.400 align:start position:0%
25,000 and comp over base total of 75 so
 
01:10:12.270 --> 01:10:12.280 align:start position:0%
a a third of your 75,000 was comp over
 
01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
Bas so and HRS has to find that
 
01:10:16.470 --> 01:10:16.480 align:start position:0%
percentage for those five years and then
 
01:10:18.950 --> 01:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
you know put it over here and then we
 
01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:21.000 align:start position:0%
have to look at the percentage of comp
 
01:10:23.030 --> 01:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
over base pay in the other years worked
 
01:10:23.040 --> 01:10:24.790 align:start position:0%
over base pay in the other years worked
since

01:10:24.790 --> 01:10:24.800 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
2012 find that percentage and then
 
01:10:30.910 --> 01:10:30.920 align:start position:0%
whichever percentage is lower apply that
 
01:10:34.470 --> 01:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
to the comp over base so you know and
 
01:10:36.790 --> 01:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
that that that was slightly modified for
 
01:10:38.750 --> 01:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
um group two tier b a couple years ago
 
01:10:40.709 --> 01:10:40.719 align:start position:0%
and House Bill 1587 it was a little bit
 
01:10:42.630 --> 01:10:42.640 align:start position:0%
of an improvement for them at the time
 
01:10:45.070 --> 01:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
but only for that group all of group one
 
01:10:47.350 --> 01:10:47.360 align:start position:0%
and uh tierc and group two were still
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
under this this formula and so what that
 
01:10:54.229 --> 01:10:54.239 align:start position:0%
could do you know it it if you had had
 
01:10:56.669 --> 01:10:56.679 align:start position:0%
again you you worked in a job where the
 
01:10:59.550 --> 01:10:59.560 align:start position:0%
community had readily available over
 
01:11:01.149 --> 01:11:01.159 align:start position:0%
time and you took it you picked up the
 
01:11:03.630 --> 01:11:03.640 align:start position:0%
shifts you wanted to and your your comp
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
over base you know to in total not just
 
01:11:08.990 --> 01:11:09.000 align:start position:0%
overtime was similar as a percentage
 
01:11:11.229 --> 01:11:11.239 align:start position:0%
over the course of your years uh you
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
know there may be no haircut on the high
 
01:11:15.189 --> 01:11:15.199 align:start position:0%
five or a little bit type of thing if
 
01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:17.400 align:start position:0%
you only worked overtime in your high
 
01:11:19.430 --> 01:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
five and didn't have any and only took a
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
base salary in those other years that's
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
a zero that that's not going to count so
 
01:11:27.030 --> 01:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
that that's how it was capped I mean it
 
01:11:30.550 --> 01:11:30.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's a complicated calculation
 
01:11:34.110 --> 01:11:34.120 align:start position:0%
and it it makes it harder for a rank and
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
file member with a pencil in the back of
 
01:11:37.790 --> 01:11:37.800 align:start position:0%
an envelope to sort of figure out their
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
pension you know they going to figure
 
01:11:40.590 --> 01:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
out how many years they worked and they
 
01:11:42.629 --> 01:11:42.639 align:start position:0%
know the multipliers but there's this
 
01:11:44.510 --> 01:11:44.520 align:start position:0%
sort of unless they have every patri
 
01:11:46.990 --> 01:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
stub they ever worked and you know saved
 
01:11:48.310 --> 01:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
you know and they they you know
 
01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet you know it you know there's
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
a little bit of uncertainty so this bill
 
01:11:58.149 --> 01:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
uh would put overtime for tier B back
 
01:12:00.910 --> 01:12:00.920 align:start position:0%
into base so it can't be Offset you know
 
01:12:03.470 --> 01:12:03.480 align:start position:0%
it's not going to you know
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
be affected by the formula so that would
 
01:12:08.870 --> 01:12:08.880 align:start position:0%
leave detail pay and those other sort of
 
01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:11.520 align:start position:0%
lesser pay types as as comp over base
 
01:12:14.629 --> 01:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
you know the expectation is that would
 
01:12:16.669 --> 01:12:16.679 align:start position:0%
um you
 
01:12:16.679 --> 01:12:18.669 align:start position:0%
um you
know

01:12:18.669 --> 01:12:18.679 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:12:22.790 --> 01:12:22.800 align:start position:0%
um you know in incre increase a benefit
 
01:12:24.629 --> 01:12:24.639 align:start position:0%
because the reduction you know the
 
01:12:26.430 --> 01:12:26.440 align:start position:0%
possibility of a reduction was lesson
 
01:12:28.550 --> 01:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
but again the change would affect
 
01:12:31.070 --> 01:12:31.080 align:start position:0%
individual members individually there's
 
01:12:33.550 --> 01:12:33.560 align:start position:0%
no blanket you can average out you know
 
01:12:35.910 --> 01:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
a percentage once we have data but you
 
01:12:38.030 --> 01:12:38.040 align:start position:0%
know it it it's depends on everybody's
 
01:12:39.870 --> 01:12:39.880 align:start position:0%
individual pay history with this so
 
01:12:42.430 --> 01:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
there's not a one one shop answer for it
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
so so that that's sort of the the short
 
01:12:47.350 --> 01:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
version believe it or
 
01:12:50.590 --> 01:12:50.600 align:start position:0%
not um and you know the the again it's
 
01:12:53.189 --> 01:12:53.199 align:start position:0%
it's for for tier B only the previous
 
01:12:56.070 --> 01:12:56.080 align:start position:0%
bill was tier B and C the fiscal impact
 
01:13:00.390 --> 01:13:00.400 align:start position:0%
on this is is listed on the uh bill as a
 
01:13:02.390 --> 01:13:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative employer contribution
 
01:13:04.709 --> 01:13:04.719 align:start position:0%
increase and then uh contribution
 
01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:08.360 align:start position:0%
amounts for 2026 again this would also
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
be an ongoing cost the rate increase
 
01:13:13.629 --> 01:13:13.639 align:start position:0%
includes for this one both the unfunded
 
01:13:16.590 --> 01:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
liability piece and future normal cost I
 
01:13:18.669 --> 01:13:18.679 align:start position:0%
think the unfunded on this is a little
 
01:13:21.550 --> 01:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
bit under 26.6 million so there's no no
 
01:13:23.189 --> 01:13:23.199 align:start position:0%
appropriation attached to this this
 
01:13:24.990 --> 01:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
would just be a change in law so all of
 
01:13:27.229 --> 01:13:27.239 align:start position:0%
the the cost would F back into the
 
01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:30.560 align:start position:0%
employer rates and U just just one thing
 
01:13:33.070 --> 01:13:33.080 align:start position:0%
to to emphasize and pick up on what
 
01:13:36.510 --> 01:13:36.520 align:start position:0%
representative Simon said earlier is all
 
01:13:38.669 --> 01:13:38.679 align:start position:0%
any any set of retirement bills but
 
01:13:39.990 --> 01:13:40.000 align:start position:0%
particularly these these three this
 
01:13:42.910 --> 01:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
morning if you were looking to say well
 
01:13:44.790 --> 01:13:44.800 align:start position:0%
how much if we pass them all how much
 
01:13:46.270 --> 01:13:46.280 align:start position:0%
would it cost and if you look at the
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes and add them up that's not
 
01:13:49.790 --> 01:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
going to get you the true answer because
 
01:13:52.110 --> 01:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
they kind of compound on each other um
 
01:13:53.990 --> 01:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
so that you know and we don't have have
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
and we wouldn't have an analysis unless
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
it was a combined bill um you know that
 
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
way because if your multiplier is larger
 
01:14:02.510 --> 01:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
in your AFC is larger it's going to you
 
01:14:04.030 --> 01:14:04.040 align:start position:0%
know going to be larger than if one of
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
the other was changed so you know there
 
01:14:07.950 --> 01:14:07.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of moving Parts um you
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
know with this and you know so we would
 
01:14:13.149 --> 01:14:13.159 align:start position:0%
have to have employers Again Begin
 
01:14:15.550 --> 01:14:15.560 align:start position:0%
reporting over time as base for that
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
segment of members um going forward if
 
01:14:21.669 --> 01:14:21.679 align:start position:0%
if the bill passed on the effective
 
01:14:24.310 --> 01:14:24.320 align:start position:0%
date clct the answer questions thank you
 
01:14:26.390 --> 01:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin I believe that it helps
 
01:14:30.430 --> 01:14:30.440 align:start position:0%
explain why the uh the commission mostly
 
01:14:32.030 --> 01:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
decided to concentrate on the
 
01:14:35.310 --> 01:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
multipliers so those were much more
 
01:14:38.110 --> 01:14:38.120 align:start position:0%
understandable representative Simon
 
01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:39.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you Mr
 
01:14:42.510 --> 01:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
Carlin um fiscal year 2025 it says
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
there's an indeterminable increase do
 
01:14:46.510 --> 01:14:46.520 align:start position:0%
you have any idea why that particular
 
01:14:49.709 --> 01:14:49.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.709 --> 01:14:51.719 align:start position:0%
indeterminable um is this on the f is
 
01:14:53.390 --> 01:14:53.400 align:start position:0%
this on fisal Note yeah the first page
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.430 --> 01:15:00.440 align:start position:0%
okay oh inet terminal will do to
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
administrative cost related to
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
reprogramming so that's you know okay
 
01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
you know they'll give us a price but you
 
01:15:08.709 --> 01:15:08.719 align:start position:0%
know you know it'll give us a set of
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
hours because you probably probably be
 
01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:13.189 align:start position:0%
hours because you probably probably be
you

01:15:13.189 --> 01:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:17.270 --> 01:15:17.280 align:start position:0%
know 50 to 150,000 I would you know
 
01:15:18.750 --> 01:15:18.760 align:start position:0%
based on past history with some of the
 
01:15:21.110 --> 01:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
stuff all right thank
 
01:15:24.750 --> 01:15:24.760 align:start position:0%
youa thank you madam chair uh Mr Carlin
 
01:15:27.950 --> 01:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
can you give us um an example of how for
 
01:15:30.870 --> 01:15:30.880 align:start position:0%
example leaving your job for a
 
01:15:33.110 --> 01:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
disability or
 
01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:36.080 align:start position:0%
military U responsibilities would
 
01:15:39.030 --> 01:15:39.040 align:start position:0%
affect this yeah yeah that that's
 
01:15:40.950 --> 01:15:40.960 align:start position:0%
actually been been you know the issue
 
01:15:42.669 --> 01:15:42.679 align:start position:0%
have we seen with individual people when
 
01:15:44.990 --> 01:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
they've come in if you are even if
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
you're in that position where you know
 
01:15:49.590 --> 01:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
you're working fairly consistent regular
 
01:15:51.149 --> 01:15:51.159 align:start position:0%
amount of overtime and things like that
 
01:15:54.830 --> 01:15:54.840 align:start position:0%
and it you know it and you were deployed
 
01:15:56.790 --> 01:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
and you got service for those years or
 
01:15:58.310 --> 01:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
you were on workers comp so you're only
 
01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
getting a base pay you know when you're
 
01:16:03.629 --> 01:16:03.639 align:start position:0%
doing that percentage that period of
 
01:16:07.590 --> 01:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
time is a zero in there so so it it it
 
01:16:11.390 --> 01:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
could lower it it down um considerably
 
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
depending on the period of you're you're
 
01:16:15.149 --> 01:16:15.159 align:start position:0%
you're getting service but you're not
 
01:16:16.709 --> 01:16:16.719 align:start position:0%
really active doing everything you were
 
01:16:18.390 --> 01:16:18.400 align:start position:0%
able to before
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
01:16:23.709 --> 01:16:23.719 align:start position:0%
leus thank you I mean this relates to to
 
01:16:25.870 --> 01:16:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh an earlier question from
 
01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:26.990 align:start position:0%
uh an earlier question from
representative

01:16:26.990 --> 01:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:16:29.310 --> 01:16:29.320 align:start position:0%
Simon um if I'm understanding your
 
01:16:33.270 --> 01:16:33.280 align:start position:0%
description of how it works now um that
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
is basically sort of an anti-s spiking
 
01:16:38.590 --> 01:16:38.600 align:start position:0%
protection because it prevents you from
 
01:16:40.350 --> 01:16:40.360 align:start position:0%
having during your high five years
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
deciding to work lots of overtime and
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
having that jack up your
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
pension um
 
01:16:51.270 --> 01:16:51.280 align:start position:0%
but with this change in the bill it
 
01:16:53.390 --> 01:16:53.400 align:start position:0%
seems that at least for the people who
 
01:16:55.990 --> 01:16:56.000 align:start position:0%
um are affected who are hired before
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
July 1 2011 that it removes that anti-s
 
01:17:03.110 --> 01:17:03.120 align:start position:0%
spiking U effect is that
 
01:17:06.510 --> 01:17:06.520 align:start position:0%
correct y i I'll I'll defer to the def
 
01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:08.239 align:start position:0%
definition of spiking because I I've
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
heard many um you know but but uh you
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
know I won't use that term but it it
 
01:17:15.430 --> 01:17:15.440 align:start position:0%
reduces it increases the amount that
 
01:17:18.070 --> 01:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
goes into base pay which there is no
 
01:17:20.470 --> 01:17:20.480 align:start position:0%
Governor or cap on other than is you
 
01:17:22.590 --> 01:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
know the maximum benefit limit or or
 
01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
things like that so so it would likely
 
01:17:28.430 --> 01:17:28.440 align:start position:0%
for people with you know who do overtime
 
01:17:29.790 --> 01:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
over the course of their career increase
 
01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:30.669 align:start position:0%
over the course of their career increase
their

01:17:30.669 --> 01:17:30.679 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:17:34.310 --> 01:17:34.320 align:start position:0%
pensions okay thank you yes if it's
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
included in base pay however for the
 
01:17:39.629 --> 01:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
period that it's in base pay it would
 
01:17:42.709 --> 01:17:42.719 align:start position:0%
decrease the percentage of overtime
 
01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
work because you'd have more in base pay
 
01:17:48.709 --> 01:17:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:48.719 --> 01:17:51.550 align:start position:0%
 
overtime

01:17:51.550 --> 01:17:51.560 align:start position:0%
overtime
 
01:17:55.189 --> 01:17:55.199 align:start position:0%
not I'm not getting that um well if you
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
normally work 10% overtime Y and at this
 
01:18:01.149 --> 01:18:01.159 align:start position:0%
and this bill passes and you work your
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
10% overtime you are showing zero above
 
01:18:07.709 --> 01:18:07.719 align:start position:0%
base because it's in base so if that's
 
01:18:09.830 --> 01:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
correct it could actually could it
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
reduce your pension no because it's the
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
lesser of the two percentages you know
 
01:18:16.950 --> 01:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
the high high five versus the other
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
period so the if if if base wasn't if
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
you worked another five years after the
 
01:18:24.310 --> 01:18:24.320 align:start position:0%
bill pass and your base pay was higher
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
your percentage of comp over base would
 
01:18:28.030 --> 01:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
be lower so it would
 
01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.550 align:start position:0%
be lower so it would
hold

01:18:29.550 --> 01:18:29.560 align:start position:0%
hold
 
01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay it's
 
01:18:35.430 --> 01:18:35.440 align:start position:0%
complicated any other
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
questions all right and I'm hoping the
 
01:18:39.310 --> 01:18:39.320 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is going to have a lovely
 
01:18:41.590 --> 01:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
time dealing with this
 
01:18:51.910 --> 01:18:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:59.870 align:start position:0%
 
real

01:18:59.870 --> 01:18:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:01.149 --> 01:19:01.159 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:19:03.070 --> 01:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh I will introduce myself
 
01:19:05.470 --> 01:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
this time uh for the record Brian re I'm
 
01:19:06.470 --> 01:19:06.480 align:start position:0%
the president of the professional
 
01:19:08.430 --> 01:19:08.440 align:start position:0%
firefighters in New Hampshire uh we
 
01:19:11.629 --> 01:19:11.639 align:start position:0%
represent approximately 2,000 active and
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
retired firefighters in the state um
 
01:19:16.870 --> 01:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
I'll be uh a little bit brief on this
 
01:19:18.310 --> 01:19:18.320 align:start position:0%
and and you won't have to hear from me
 
01:19:20.270 --> 01:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
again today uh We've signed in support
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
on bills and and submitted written
 
01:19:25.310 --> 01:19:25.320 align:start position:0%
testimony um but I do think it's fair to
 
01:19:26.709 --> 01:19:26.719 align:start position:0%
address this
 
01:19:30.430 --> 01:19:30.440 align:start position:0%
issue um this was uh another issue that
 
01:19:33.310 --> 01:19:33.320 align:start position:0%
was discussed or a similar Bill like it
 
01:19:36.669 --> 01:19:36.679 align:start position:0%
was discussed in the commission on uh
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
mandatory overtime and what that means
 
01:19:41.390 --> 01:19:41.400 align:start position:0%
so in this profession and I know it was
 
01:19:42.990 --> 01:19:43.000 align:start position:0%
uh mentioned a little earlier from
 
01:19:46.149 --> 01:19:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson uh oftentimes
 
01:19:48.030 --> 01:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
overtime is not an
 
01:19:51.110 --> 01:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
option oftentimes overtime is
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
forced um we due to the Recruitment and
 
01:19:57.310 --> 01:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
Retention issue which we all recognize
 
01:20:00.390 --> 01:20:00.400 align:start position:0%
exists and we've all acknowledged exists
 
01:20:03.390 --> 01:20:03.400 align:start position:0%
um we found a difficult time filling
 
01:20:05.390 --> 01:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
vacancies in our departments which
 
01:20:09.030 --> 01:20:09.040 align:start position:0%
creates a situation where cities in
 
01:20:12.629 --> 01:20:12.639 align:start position:0%
towns must staff fire trucks we must
 
01:20:15.189 --> 01:20:15.199 align:start position:0%
staff ambulances and we must staff
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
police cars it creates a situation where
 
01:20:21.030 --> 01:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
if someone doesn't come to work whether
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
it be uh use of their vacation time
 
01:20:29.030 --> 01:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
being sick or being disabled those
 
01:20:31.189 --> 01:20:31.199 align:start position:0%
shifts still have to be filled the
 
01:20:32.470 --> 01:20:32.480 align:start position:0%
trucks still need to respond to
 
01:20:34.470 --> 01:20:34.480 align:start position:0%
emergencies and we still need to treat
 
01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.350 align:start position:0%
emergencies and we still need to treat
the

01:20:35.350 --> 01:20:35.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:20:38.590 --> 01:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
public often times that means we're
 
01:20:41.189 --> 01:20:41.199 align:start position:0%
being forced to hold over and forced to
 
01:20:45.310 --> 01:20:45.320 align:start position:0%
stay at work this creates uh not only a
 
01:20:47.910 --> 01:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
situation where a firefighter is unable
 
01:20:51.470 --> 01:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
to return home creates a situation where
 
01:20:53.350 --> 01:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
they're uh incre increasing their time
 
01:20:55.990 --> 01:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
away from their family increasing their
 
01:20:57.510 --> 01:20:57.520 align:start position:0%
time away from other obligations they
 
01:21:00.669 --> 01:21:00.679 align:start position:0%
may have in life um in order to protect
 
01:21:02.990 --> 01:21:03.000 align:start position:0%
the citizens of their
 
01:21:05.430 --> 01:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
communities oftentimes this means
 
01:21:08.189 --> 01:21:08.199 align:start position:0%
firefighters are expected to work 48
 
01:21:10.189 --> 01:21:10.199 align:start position:0%
straight hours or
 
01:21:12.910 --> 01:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
more creating health and safety issues
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
such as sleep
 
01:21:18.590 --> 01:21:18.600 align:start position:0%
deprivation um behavioral health issues
 
01:21:21.350 --> 01:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
substance abuse issues marital issues
 
01:21:23.590 --> 01:21:23.600 align:start position:0%
and strain in the home
 
01:21:27.149 --> 01:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
um our firefighters are being asked to
 
01:21:30.590 --> 01:21:30.600 align:start position:0%
solve many of the world's problems and
 
01:21:34.030 --> 01:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
as a thanks their overtime hours that uh
 
01:21:35.910 --> 01:21:35.920 align:start position:0%
in many cases they're not given the
 
01:21:38.790 --> 01:21:38.800 align:start position:0%
option to work are being extrapolated
 
01:21:42.189 --> 01:21:42.199 align:start position:0%
and diluted down to work on a different
 
01:21:45.110 --> 01:21:45.120 align:start position:0%
calculation um representative Pearson
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
said it best earlier uh that you can
 
01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:48.520 align:start position:0%
work on a
 
01:21:51.070 --> 01:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and your salary is worth one
 
01:21:53.669 --> 01:21:53.679 align:start position:0%
amount but if you work on on a Thursday
 
01:21:56.310 --> 01:21:56.320 align:start position:0%
it's worth uh it's worth something
 
01:21:58.350 --> 01:21:58.360 align:start position:0%
different now what's interesting about
 
01:22:00.510 --> 01:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
that is you're asking to be work or
 
01:22:03.350 --> 01:22:03.360 align:start position:0%
you're being told to work more hours um
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
but you're not you're not getting the
 
01:22:07.669 --> 01:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
increased benefit on the back end for
 
01:22:09.830 --> 01:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
that um and I think that that is
 
01:22:12.910 --> 01:22:12.920 align:start position:0%
something that we need to look at um and
 
01:22:15.110 --> 01:22:15.120 align:start position:0%
and determine whether or not that's
 
01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:16.750 align:start position:0%
and determine whether or not that's
fair

01:22:16.750 --> 01:22:16.760 align:start position:0%
fair
 
01:22:19.590 --> 01:22:19.600 align:start position:0%
um while we're being expected to work
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
these additional hours um we should be
 
01:22:25.590 --> 01:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
told that it's going to affect our
 
01:22:27.629 --> 01:22:27.639 align:start position:0%
pension on the back end um I don't think
 
01:22:29.709 --> 01:22:29.719 align:start position:0%
we're doing ourselves any any favors for
 
01:22:31.590 --> 01:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
Recruitment and Retention so I would ask
 
01:22:33.830 --> 01:22:33.840 align:start position:0%
for the committee's support on this bill
 
01:22:35.350 --> 01:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
um and and another bill that you'll be
 
01:22:37.990 --> 01:22:38.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on a later date uh similar to it
 
01:22:39.550 --> 01:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
um but I would like to voice my support
 
01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:42.400 align:start position:0%
for that thank you thank you other
 
01:22:45.550 --> 01:22:45.560 align:start position:0%
questions yes represent gold thank you
 
01:22:47.110 --> 01:22:47.120 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
question am I understanding correctly
 
01:22:52.669 --> 01:22:52.679 align:start position:0%
that um what you're saying is that there
 
01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
are times when workers are working
 
01:22:57.430 --> 01:22:57.440 align:start position:0%
overtime and it's not to spike their
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
retirement but that the current
 
01:23:03.270 --> 01:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
calculation becomes punitive against
 
01:23:05.709 --> 01:23:05.719 align:start position:0%
positively impacting their retirement
 
01:23:08.350 --> 01:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
benefits thank you for the question um I
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
wouldn't necessarily use the word
 
01:23:12.550 --> 01:23:12.560 align:start position:0%
punitive because it is calculated um in
 
01:23:16.030 --> 01:23:16.040 align:start position:0%
some manner it's just calculated in a uh
 
01:23:18.030 --> 01:23:18.040 align:start position:0%
different manner than it used to be and
 
01:23:21.110 --> 01:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
that number is diluted down um I I would
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
agree with the statement or or the part
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
of your question that says um often this
 
01:23:29.350 --> 01:23:29.360 align:start position:0%
is not elective overtime that is
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
intended to spike one's pension uh again
 
01:23:36.149 --> 01:23:36.159 align:start position:0%
there are mechanisms in place to uh
 
01:23:40.070 --> 01:23:40.080 align:start position:0%
eliminate the spiking provision um
 
01:23:42.669 --> 01:23:42.679 align:start position:0%
what's what's interesting to me is I
 
01:23:45.790 --> 01:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned that the the Staffing models
 
01:23:47.390 --> 01:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
that our fire departments
 
01:23:51.430 --> 01:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
have in many cases there's not a lot of
 
01:23:54.070 --> 01:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
leeway there the department has to be
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
staffed to a certain level as determined
 
01:23:59.669 --> 01:23:59.679 align:start position:0%
by either the fire chief uh elected
 
01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
officials in the cities or towns or
 
01:24:05.070 --> 01:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
working agreements um so they have to
 
01:24:08.030 --> 01:24:08.040 align:start position:0%
fill those seats whether or
 
01:24:12.110 --> 01:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
not I'm electing to work that overtime
 
01:24:14.669 --> 01:24:14.679 align:start position:0%
or someone else is being forced to work
 
01:24:18.870 --> 01:24:18.880 align:start position:0%
that overtime the municipality is having
 
01:24:21.149 --> 01:24:21.159 align:start position:0%
to pay the same percentage on that into
 
01:24:22.870 --> 01:24:22.880 align:start position:0%
the retirement so
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
um it's being calculated in one way or
 
01:24:28.709 --> 01:24:28.719 align:start position:0%
another on someone's pension um it would
 
01:24:30.790 --> 01:24:30.800 align:start position:0%
be our position that it doesn't matter
 
01:24:33.310 --> 01:24:33.320 align:start position:0%
whose pension that is whether it's
 
01:24:36.189 --> 01:24:36.199 align:start position:0%
person a or person
 
01:24:39.270 --> 01:24:39.280 align:start position:0%
B all right representative Schmidt and
 
01:24:39.280 --> 01:24:40.510 align:start position:0%
B all right representative Schmidt and
then

01:24:40.510 --> 01:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:24:43.830 --> 01:24:43.840 align:start position:0%
ly thank you madam chair can you tell me
 
01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:44.790 align:start position:0%
ly thank you madam chair can you tell me
how

01:24:44.790 --> 01:24:44.800 align:start position:0%
how
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
many uh departments or what the overall
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
shortfall is in terms of people that
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
that uh that would be on the job if they
 
01:24:58.590 --> 01:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
could find him in the state of New
 
01:25:00.990 --> 01:25:01.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's a great question I it's
 
01:25:02.669 --> 01:25:02.679 align:start position:0%
such a dynamic number I wouldn't be able
 
01:25:04.870 --> 01:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
to give you we've tried to conduct
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
surveys in the past um what I can tell
 
01:25:12.310 --> 01:25:12.320 align:start position:0%
you is that um the candidate Physical
 
01:25:14.430 --> 01:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
Agility Test which is the entrance exam
 
01:25:16.709 --> 01:25:16.719 align:start position:0%
to become a firefighter in the state we
 
01:25:18.870 --> 01:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
used to see 500 to
 
01:25:21.550 --> 01:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
550 uh candidates coming in to take that
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
test to be a fighter in the state and
 
01:25:28.390 --> 01:25:28.400 align:start position:0%
that was uh around 2010 2011's numbers
 
01:25:30.470 --> 01:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
um I think just recently the the most
 
01:25:35.070 --> 01:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.550 --> 01:25:38.560 align:start position:0%
candidates thank you repres
 
01:25:41.470 --> 01:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
Manti thank you madam chair I have a
 
01:25:43.830 --> 01:25:43.840 align:start position:0%
fundamental question what is the
 
01:25:45.510 --> 01:25:45.520 align:start position:0%
definition of
 
01:25:49.709 --> 01:25:49.719 align:start position:0%
overtime currently overtime means if I'm
 
01:25:55.229 --> 01:25:55.239 align:start position:0%
hired for 40 hours uh a week job and if
 
01:25:59.229 --> 01:25:59.239 align:start position:0%
my particular week if I work 50 hours
 
01:26:02.550 --> 01:26:02.560 align:start position:0%
whether it was mandatory or elective
 
01:26:04.790 --> 01:26:04.800 align:start position:0%
that would be considered as overtime
 
01:26:08.390 --> 01:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
correct or number of shifts per month
 
01:26:12.550 --> 01:26:12.560 align:start position:0%
and whatever the extra shift correct
 
01:26:14.510 --> 01:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question uh I do
 
01:26:20.070 --> 01:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
believe that this is um an flsa question
 
01:26:23.830 --> 01:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
and it in many cases it's determined by
 
01:26:25.470 --> 01:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
if you're in a union it's a collective
 
01:26:28.430 --> 01:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
bargaining agreement um for instance
 
01:26:31.390 --> 01:26:31.400 align:start position:0%
many departments are averaged over uh an
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
eight-week cycle and a 42h hour work
 
01:26:36.109 --> 01:26:36.119 align:start position:0%
week um but I believe by
 
01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:40.400 align:start position:0%
flsa um that that number of hours could
 
01:26:42.070 --> 01:26:42.080 align:start position:0%
increase but whatever that number is
 
01:26:44.590 --> 01:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
determined to be whether it's 42 hours
 
01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:47.719 align:start position:0%
or 56 hours anything above and beyond
 
01:26:51.030 --> 01:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
that would be time and a half would be
 
01:26:54.270 --> 01:26:54.280 align:start position:0%
over time if I say is
 
01:26:57.430 --> 01:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
the uh Fair Labor uh Fair labor
 
01:27:00.070 --> 01:27:00.080 align:start position:0%
standards act thank
 
01:27:03.430 --> 01:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
you representative blackis thank you so
 
01:27:05.030 --> 01:27:05.040 align:start position:0%
I I think I understand you know the
 
01:27:08.350 --> 01:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
concerns you've expressed but um could
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
you comment on the fact that this as I
 
01:27:14.030 --> 01:27:14.040 align:start position:0%
read it this bill would only um help
 
01:27:15.870 --> 01:27:15.880 align:start position:0%
with that situation for members who are
 
01:27:18.669 --> 01:27:18.679 align:start position:0%
hired before July 1 2011 and are still
 
01:27:21.470 --> 01:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
employed is that yes I believe that's
 
01:27:23.629 --> 01:27:23.639 align:start position:0%
the way that I didn't write the bill but
 
01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:24.920 align:start position:0%
that's the way it's written but I would
 
01:27:28.750 --> 01:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
be supportive um of that language or um
 
01:27:31.109 --> 01:27:31.119 align:start position:0%
better yet if we wanted to expand that
 
01:27:34.109 --> 01:27:34.119 align:start position:0%
for everyone this was a benefit prior to
 
01:27:36.629 --> 01:27:36.639 align:start position:0%
2011 for these folks which is why this
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
is relevant now okay thank you other
 
01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
01:27:51.109 --> 01:27:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:51.119 --> 01:27:52.669 align:start position:0%
 
bodri

01:27:52.669 --> 01:27:52.679 align:start position:0%
bodri
 
01:27:54.390 --> 01:27:54.400 align:start position:0%
Madam chairman members of the committee
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
thank you again my name is ala bodri I
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
represent the New Hampshire State
 
01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
permanent firefighters retirement
 
01:28:02.270 --> 01:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
Association I also am a retired captain
 
01:28:04.590 --> 01:28:04.600 align:start position:0%
of the Manchester fire department and I
 
01:28:08.470 --> 01:28:08.480 align:start position:0%
sat on the Board of Trustees uh for 13
 
01:28:11.590 --> 01:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
years uh this bill as I stated in prior
 
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:13.639 align:start position:0%
testimony for
 
01:28:16.430 --> 01:28:16.440 align:start position:0%
1647 um this bill just wants to
 
01:28:18.990 --> 01:28:19.000 align:start position:0%
recapture benefits that were taken away
 
01:28:23.590 --> 01:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
from members that were hired uh before
 
01:28:25.790 --> 01:28:25.800 align:start position:0%
2011 that's that's what this does they
 
01:28:27.629 --> 01:28:27.639 align:start position:0%
want to restore benefits that were taken
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
away from them which was historical um
 
01:28:34.030 --> 01:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
as representative um Pearson mentioned
 
01:28:35.709 --> 01:28:35.719 align:start position:0%
uh that was the first time that benefits
 
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
were ever taken away from a member
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
normally uh it's either in to enhance a
 
01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:43.280 align:start position:0%
benefit or if you're going to change the
 
01:28:46.149 --> 01:28:46.159 align:start position:0%
benefit it's for new hires not existing
 
01:28:48.750 --> 01:28:48.760 align:start position:0%
people that were hired so this is just
 
01:28:48.760 --> 01:28:50.430 align:start position:0%
people that were hired so this is just
another

01:28:50.430 --> 01:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
um bill and there's going to be probably
 
01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
several others
 
01:28:58.350 --> 01:28:58.360 align:start position:0%
until 436 comes to fruition uh that was
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
in 436 but this is again a piece of
 
01:29:03.590 --> 01:29:03.600 align:start position:0%
legislation just to bring back benefits
 
01:29:05.590 --> 01:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
that were taken away from members that
 
01:29:07.990 --> 01:29:08.000 align:start position:0%
were already enrolled in the system and
 
01:29:09.830 --> 01:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
to go back to
 
01:29:12.310 --> 01:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
overtime uh departments Don't Make Up
 
01:29:14.790 --> 01:29:14.800 align:start position:0%
Overtime just to enhance somebody's
 
01:29:17.830 --> 01:29:17.840 align:start position:0%
pension it's to keep their Department
 
01:29:21.669 --> 01:29:21.679 align:start position:0%
OCC uh working uh as as representative
 
01:29:23.950 --> 01:29:23.960 align:start position:0%
over Brian mentioned um his Department
 
01:29:26.669 --> 01:29:26.679 align:start position:0%
in Nashville um they have so many men
 
01:29:29.470 --> 01:29:29.480 align:start position:0%
per shift or women uh members per shift
 
01:29:31.669 --> 01:29:31.679 align:start position:0%
and they have to they have to work that
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
in Manchester when I was on the uh on
 
01:29:37.629 --> 01:29:37.639 align:start position:0%
the department um as a committee I mean
 
01:29:40.590 --> 01:29:40.600 align:start position:0%
representative um Pearson mentioned we
 
01:29:43.270 --> 01:29:43.280 align:start position:0%
have a list of of our department and it
 
01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:47.280 align:start position:0%
would go by um by the one who has you go
 
01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:49.360 align:start position:0%
a rotating motion so you know same
 
01:29:50.350 --> 01:29:50.360 align:start position:0%
person is not going to be getting
 
01:29:52.830 --> 01:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
overtime every single time it it comes
 
01:29:56.189 --> 01:29:56.199 align:start position:0%
up um and in Manchester it's really not
 
01:29:57.830 --> 01:29:57.840 align:start position:0%
mandatory at least it wasn't when I was
 
01:30:00.629 --> 01:30:00.639 align:start position:0%
on the job uh that if they couldn't find
 
01:30:02.709 --> 01:30:02.719 align:start position:0%
somebody uh they would close a station
 
01:30:05.470 --> 01:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
down so you're now you're getting less
 
01:30:07.870 --> 01:30:07.880 align:start position:0%
protection in the city because they
 
01:30:10.350 --> 01:30:10.360 align:start position:0%
would have to close either a engine
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
company down or a ladder company down
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
and take that Manpower and and disperse
 
01:30:17.030 --> 01:30:17.040 align:start position:0%
it uh to to fill in the shifts that were
 
01:30:21.189 --> 01:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
were vacant um and also the uh recently
 
01:30:23.149 --> 01:30:23.159 align:start position:0%
uh in Manchester so we used to get paid
 
01:30:25.870 --> 01:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
time and a half and they hired a bunch
 
01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
of Subs that would come in um and
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
actually take over shifts because they
 
01:30:32.709 --> 01:30:32.719 align:start position:0%
felt it was cheaper than paying time and
 
01:30:35.149 --> 01:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
a half so they had floaters that would
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
come in they had so many captains so
 
01:30:39.470 --> 01:30:39.480 align:start position:0%
many lieutenants so many uh firefighters
 
01:30:41.109 --> 01:30:41.119 align:start position:0%
and when somebody called in sick this
 
01:30:43.149 --> 01:30:43.159 align:start position:0%
floater would take their position well
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
when the department went to straight pay
 
01:30:48.550 --> 01:30:48.560 align:start position:0%
those those positions were pretty much
 
01:30:50.229 --> 01:30:50.239 align:start position:0%
absorbed and I don't believe they have
 
01:30:52.109 --> 01:30:52.119 align:start position:0%
floaters anymore cuz it's actually
 
01:30:55.590 --> 01:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
cheaper now to pay an individual to work
 
01:30:58.030 --> 01:30:58.040 align:start position:0%
overtime at straight pay than it is to
 
01:30:59.629 --> 01:30:59.639 align:start position:0%
hire somebody and pay all the extra
 
01:31:02.990 --> 01:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
benefits so it actually benefits uh the
 
01:31:04.750 --> 01:31:04.760 align:start position:0%
Departments to have them work in the
 
01:31:07.830 --> 01:31:07.840 align:start position:0%
overtime at straight pay um so with that
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
I will answer any questions thank you
 
01:31:12.709 --> 01:31:12.719 align:start position:0%
are there any
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
questions thank you hold done is there
 
01:31:17.070 --> 01:31:17.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
01:31:19.750 --> 01:31:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
1653 all right seeing none I will close
 
01:31:26.910 --> 01:31:26.920 align:start position:0%
the hearing and open the hearing on
 
01:31:35.830 --> 01:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.750 --> 01:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:50.760 --> 01:31:58.390 align:start position:0%
 
Pearson

01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:01.550 --> 01:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
hello thank you for listening to our
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
testimony uh 16 let's see 1673 is going
 
01:32:08.470 --> 01:32:08.480 align:start position:0%
to be basically what we've talked about
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
already one of the compensations that we
 
01:32:11.040 --> 01:32:14.510 align:start position:0%
already one of the compensations that we
had

01:32:14.510 --> 01:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.990 --> 01:32:17.000 align:start position:0%
lost I plans on doing that this is I'm
 
01:32:18.590 --> 01:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
Kevin Pratt representative Kevin Pratt
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
from Raymond New Hampshire retired fire
 
01:32:23.430 --> 01:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
chief firefighter for 42 years uh if I a
 
01:32:26.750 --> 01:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
chieve for 29 um I was working at the
 
01:32:29.790 --> 01:32:29.800 align:start position:0%
time that uh in 2011 when they made
 
01:32:33.510 --> 01:32:33.520 align:start position:0%
changes to full-time employees uh taking
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
away over seven benefits that really
 
01:32:38.310 --> 01:32:38.320 align:start position:0%
drastically reduced their end
 
01:32:40.629 --> 01:32:40.639 align:start position:0%
retirement and one of the reasons I ran
 
01:32:44.350 --> 01:32:44.360 align:start position:0%
for State Rep was to try to improve that
 
01:32:50.109 --> 01:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
situation so if you read six uh 1673
 
01:32:53.550 --> 01:32:53.560 align:start position:0%
you'll see that it is uh a very small
 
01:32:56.590 --> 01:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
adjustment instead of uh calculating
 
01:32:58.870 --> 01:32:58.880 align:start position:0%
your base pay over your whole career
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a it's going to make it
 
01:33:03.870 --> 01:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
down to seven years you can imagine if
 
01:33:06.109 --> 01:33:06.119 align:start position:0%
you're bringing into a formula your
 
01:33:09.070 --> 01:33:09.080 align:start position:0%
first year employment um and you've
 
01:33:11.229 --> 01:33:11.239 align:start position:0%
worked 30 years your first year of
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
employment is a lot different than your
 
01:33:14.550 --> 01:33:14.560 align:start position:0%
last year of employment so when you
 
01:33:18.430 --> 01:33:18.440 align:start position:0%
throw in a whole life time of our hourly
 
01:33:21.149 --> 01:33:21.159 align:start position:0%
yearly wages it really would reduce the
 
01:33:22.790 --> 01:33:22.800 align:start position:0%
amount of money that you would retire at
 
01:33:25.229 --> 01:33:25.239 align:start position:0%
at the end and that change was a drastic
 
01:33:27.189 --> 01:33:27.199 align:start position:0%
change that was made in
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
2011 so that is one of the changes we're
 
01:33:31.830 --> 01:33:31.840 align:start position:0%
bringing back that was was in the
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
original bill that we were talking about
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
earlier so I add to that sure so this
 
01:33:41.709 --> 01:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
this is just like um 1653
 
01:33:44.629 --> 01:33:44.639 align:start position:0%
1673 th both of these are Provisions
 
01:33:46.990 --> 01:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
that were in House Bill
 
01:33:50.109 --> 01:33:50.119 align:start position:0%
436 now in this particular case um we
 
01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:51.560 align:start position:0%
got two things going on here the first
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
first one is there is a reference typo
 
01:33:57.510 --> 01:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
in line one thank you ol we'll we'll
 
01:33:59.750 --> 01:33:59.760 align:start position:0%
address it when it when that comes it's
 
01:34:01.709 --> 01:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
a I mean it could be handled in enrolled
 
01:34:03.790 --> 01:34:03.800 align:start position:0%
bills technically but it's there is a if
 
01:34:06.030 --> 01:34:06.040 align:start position:0%
you could explain it please sure uh
 
01:34:09.669 --> 01:34:09.679 align:start position:0%
instead of RSA 100a Roman numeral 13
 
01:34:11.870 --> 01:34:11.880 align:start position:0%
It's supposed to have a little bitty V
 
01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:24.270 --> 01:34:24.280 align:start position:0%
I that makes it 10 D3 10 V b i i i so
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
instead of 13 it's actually
 
01:34:31.629 --> 01:34:31.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:34.030 --> 01:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
ah thank you that will make a difference
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
I'm sure absolutely so so to so what
 
01:34:40.030 --> 01:34:40.040 align:start position:0%
this does is this is this is a comp over
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
base thing right so the prior Bill
 
01:34:42.480 --> 01:34:43.790 align:start position:0%
base thing right so the prior Bill
addressed

01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
overtime the rest of that is your comp
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
over base so that involves details and a
 
01:34:55.470 --> 01:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
lot of the other ancillary stuff that
 
01:34:58.390 --> 01:34:58.400 align:start position:0%
that under the law was changed it was
 
01:34:59.590 --> 01:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
the that's actually the first
 
01:35:01.189 --> 01:35:01.199 align:start position:0%
retroactive thing that was ever done it
 
01:35:03.189 --> 01:35:03.199 align:start position:0%
was done in 2009 and really kind of flew
 
01:35:05.590 --> 01:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
under the radar when that went from a
 
01:35:07.870 --> 01:35:07.880 align:start position:0%
three-year average to a seven-year
 
01:35:11.709 --> 01:35:11.719 align:start position:0%
average so this doesn't restore it back
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
to the original Three but it puts it at
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
a Level Playing Field with everybody
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
else who's at it who's at seven right
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
now and that it just mirrors that
 
01:35:27.189 --> 01:35:27.199 align:start position:0%
language that's all it does so
 
01:35:30.030 --> 01:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that I've asked Mr
 
01:35:33.790 --> 01:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
Carlin because he and I speak a lot is
 
01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
what what happened prior to
 
01:35:40.910 --> 01:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
2012 right because this this
 
01:35:44.109 --> 01:35:44.119 align:start position:0%
change goes back to everyone so if you
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
were hired in
 
01:35:49.109 --> 01:35:49.119 align:start position:0%
1984 that changed for you as well we
 
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
changed that this for vested people
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
people in
 
01:35:55.709 --> 01:35:55.719 align:start position:0%
2009 and like I said it very much flew
 
01:35:57.870 --> 01:35:57.880 align:start position:0%
under the radar
 
01:36:01.109 --> 01:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
so how do you how do you deal with a a
 
01:36:03.790 --> 01:36:03.800 align:start position:0%
formula to which you have no
 
01:36:06.590 --> 01:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
data because we didn't collect it as as
 
01:36:09.350 --> 01:36:09.360 align:start position:0%
Marty said prior to 2012 the reporting
 
01:36:10.750 --> 01:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't go that way they just
 
01:36:14.629 --> 01:36:14.639 align:start position:0%
handed you a number so they can't
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
calculate it prior to
 
01:36:19.229 --> 01:36:19.239 align:start position:0%
2012 it just doesn't exist so if you do
 
01:36:22.430 --> 01:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
a 30-year career and you retire
 
01:36:24.590 --> 01:36:24.600 align:start position:0%
tomorrow when they do your career
 
01:36:26.990 --> 01:36:27.000 align:start position:0%
average it's really just since
 
01:36:30.070 --> 01:36:30.080 align:start position:0%
2012 but for those moving
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
forward that's not the
 
01:36:36.550 --> 01:36:36.560 align:start position:0%
case this legislation does not carve
 
01:36:41.870 --> 01:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
out anybody this puts the entire run
 
01:36:45.590 --> 01:36:45.600 align:start position:0%
back to I'm sorry incorrect this does
 
01:36:47.590 --> 01:36:47.600 align:start position:0%
carve out the group my apologies this
 
01:36:48.950 --> 01:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
one does the same thing as the other one
 
01:36:51.430 --> 01:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
did it's the folks that were retroactive
 
01:36:55.990 --> 01:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
2011 so your group your tier I know
 
01:37:00.990 --> 01:37:01.000 align:start position:0%
we're using tiers that are not in
 
01:37:03.629 --> 01:37:03.639 align:start position:0%
statute but we'll call those the tier B
 
01:37:03.639 --> 01:37:05.149 align:start position:0%
statute but we'll call those the tier B
folks

01:37:05.149 --> 01:37:05.159 align:start position:0%
folks
 
01:37:07.310 --> 01:37:07.320 align:start position:0%
um and that's that's what that does it
 
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:14.470 --> 01:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
a thank you are there any questions
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
representative Schmidt and AV
 
01:37:19.709 --> 01:37:19.719 align:start position:0%
py thank you madam chair you did say
 
01:37:21.470 --> 01:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
that the all these bills are going a
 
01:37:24.950 --> 01:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
subcommittee right absolutely we as for
 
01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
Mr Carlin pointed out you can't consider
 
01:37:29.629 --> 01:37:29.639 align:start position:0%
one without the other because the
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
effects are not linear
 
01:37:35.229 --> 01:37:35.239 align:start position:0%
right I I I understand what's happening
 
01:37:37.590 --> 01:37:37.600 align:start position:0%
here I just don't know how to fix it
 
01:37:39.910 --> 01:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
either represent man
 
01:37:43.669 --> 01:37:43.679 align:start position:0%
py thank you Madame chair I I'm new to
 
01:37:47.790 --> 01:37:47.800 align:start position:0%
this uh committee so my question is when
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
the changes happened in 2011
 
01:37:54.470 --> 01:37:54.480 align:start position:0%
nobody was
 
01:37:58.790 --> 01:37:58.800 align:start position:0%
grandfathered that and there was
 
01:38:02.350 --> 01:38:02.360 align:start position:0%
no compensation for people who have
 
01:38:05.189 --> 01:38:05.199 align:start position:0%
already served are at the cusp of
 
01:38:08.669 --> 01:38:08.679 align:start position:0%
getting a bet so you're trying to fix
 
01:38:11.669 --> 01:38:11.679 align:start position:0%
but this is not retroactive this is only
 
01:38:14.910 --> 01:38:14.920 align:start position:0%
going forward correct no this this would
 
01:38:17.390 --> 01:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
this would go back to 2012 when when the
 
01:38:20.350 --> 01:38:20.360 align:start position:0%
retirement system required a a
 
01:38:23.950 --> 01:38:23.960 align:start position:0%
separation or categorization of of your
 
01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.870 align:start position:0%
separation or categorization of of your
overall

01:38:25.870 --> 01:38:25.880 align:start position:0%
overall
 
01:38:28.550 --> 01:38:28.560 align:start position:0%
salary it can't go beyond 2012 because
 
01:38:30.390 --> 01:38:30.400 align:start position:0%
there's no data it just doesn't exist
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
they re representative maputi the people
 
01:38:35.870 --> 01:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
who were vested that has had more than
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
10 years of service at the moment of
 
01:38:41.070 --> 01:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
determination were not affected by the
 
01:38:44.430 --> 01:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
change the people what the people who
 
01:38:47.030 --> 01:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
were affected it will go into the
 
01:38:49.310 --> 01:38:49.320 align:start position:0%
calculation of their retirement which is
 
01:38:52.550 --> 01:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
not yet final so it's not exactly
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
retroactive but it does include the
 
01:38:56.669 --> 01:38:56.679 align:start position:0%
benefit of the year's
 
01:38:59.910 --> 01:38:59.920 align:start position:0%
work just to follow up to clarify Madam
 
01:39:03.350 --> 01:39:03.360 align:start position:0%
chair so if in that case if they're
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
still continuing to work here they will
 
01:39:09.189 --> 01:39:09.199 align:start position:0%
get the benefit if they have already
 
01:39:12.030 --> 01:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
moved on right too B correct you don't
 
01:39:14.510 --> 01:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
have it once the person retires their
 
01:39:17.189 --> 01:39:17.199 align:start position:0%
their pension is fixed and not changed
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature decides to Grant
 
01:39:23.030 --> 01:39:23.040 align:start position:0%
a cost of living increase thank you yep
 
01:39:26.070 --> 01:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
that is true okay other other
 
01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
questions all right just one more
 
01:39:31.070 --> 01:39:31.080 align:start position:0%
statement before I leave I I hear um the
 
01:39:32.189 --> 01:39:32.199 align:start position:0%
talk of
 
01:39:35.310 --> 01:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
spiking you know overtime is figured for
 
01:39:37.310 --> 01:39:37.320 align:start position:0%
most people that work over 40 hours
 
01:39:39.550 --> 01:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
firemen can quite often be 52 hours
 
01:39:41.990 --> 01:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
before the overtime even kicks in so
 
01:39:43.589 --> 01:39:43.599 align:start position:0%
that's a self-limiting factor right
 
01:39:45.350 --> 01:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
there if you're working 52 hours are not
 
01:39:47.750 --> 01:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
getting overtime 12 hours of that is
 
01:39:49.629 --> 01:39:49.639 align:start position:0%
straight pay so that's kind of a
 
01:39:51.750 --> 01:39:51.760 align:start position:0%
self-limiting factor right there in the
 
01:39:53.189 --> 01:39:53.199 align:start position:0%
fact that you're not really spiking and
 
01:39:55.669 --> 01:39:55.679 align:start position:0%
if you're only doing it for a few years
 
01:39:59.189 --> 01:39:59.199 align:start position:0%
figur over seven years that's um really
 
01:40:01.109 --> 01:40:01.119 align:start position:0%
a pretty much leveling field right there
 
01:40:03.950 --> 01:40:03.960 align:start position:0%
it really levels it out and um the other
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
thing is we talk about new benefits
 
01:40:07.550 --> 01:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
these are all these builds I'm looking
 
01:40:09.189 --> 01:40:09.199 align:start position:0%
forward are not new benefits these are
 
01:40:11.109 --> 01:40:11.119 align:start position:0%
benefits that were lost for people that
 
01:40:13.030 --> 01:40:13.040 align:start position:0%
are already working here for 10 years so
 
01:40:15.189 --> 01:40:15.199 align:start position:0%
we're just looking to try to get back
 
01:40:16.990 --> 01:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
what was lost not looking for new
 
01:40:18.950 --> 01:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
benefits new money for people we're not
 
01:40:21.550 --> 01:40:21.560 align:start position:0%
looking for new benefits or new money
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you yeah other
 
01:40:27.070 --> 01:40:27.080 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
 
01:40:27.080 --> 01:40:40.669 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you very much
Mr

01:40:40.669 --> 01:40:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.189 --> 01:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
Carlin Madam chair again Marty Carlin
 
01:40:45.750 --> 01:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
representing nhrs the retirement system
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a position on this bill um
 
01:40:51.470 --> 01:40:51.480 align:start position:0%
as in my prior testimony it the similar
 
01:40:55.350 --> 01:40:55.360 align:start position:0%
to the last hearing on 1653 in the sense
 
01:40:58.109 --> 01:40:58.119 align:start position:0%
that um you know this
 
01:41:00.470 --> 01:41:00.480 align:start position:0%
bill does something different to the
 
01:41:02.550 --> 01:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
comp over base formula it shortens it
 
01:41:04.149 --> 01:41:04.159 align:start position:0%
for group two tier B so instead of a
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
look back as that percentage of comp
 
01:41:09.229 --> 01:41:09.239 align:start position:0%
over base from point of retirement back
 
01:41:10.990 --> 01:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
to one one of 12 it's going to look at
 
01:41:13.149 --> 01:41:13.159 align:start position:0%
their last seven years from their
 
01:41:15.910 --> 01:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
effective date of retirement if if the
 
01:41:18.070 --> 01:41:18.080 align:start position:0%
high five for that person was in those
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
last seven years it's a much more
 
01:41:22.870 --> 01:41:22.880 align:start position:0%
probably the percentages are going to be
 
01:41:26.030 --> 01:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
very similar um type of thing so so
 
01:41:27.709 --> 01:41:27.719 align:start position:0%
that's that's basically how this bill
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
would work
 
01:41:34.390 --> 01:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
um and um yeah that's be glad to answer
 
01:41:34.400 --> 01:41:35.270 align:start position:0%
um and um yeah that's be glad to answer
any

01:41:35.270 --> 01:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.709 --> 01:41:42.719 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative leas thank
 
01:41:46.910 --> 01:41:46.920 align:start position:0%
you so um I guess currently it's it's
 
01:41:49.669 --> 01:41:49.679 align:start position:0%
the high five that the pension is based
 
01:41:52.390 --> 01:41:52.400 align:start position:0%
on and you're looking at the overtime
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
averaging um with this
 
01:41:59.430 --> 01:41:59.440 align:start position:0%
change I guess it says the last seven so
 
01:42:02.229 --> 01:42:02.239 align:start position:0%
if somebody were if their high five were
 
01:42:03.870 --> 01:42:03.880 align:start position:0%
well before the end of their career for
 
01:42:06.750 --> 01:42:06.760 align:start position:0%
some reason which probably is unlikely
 
01:42:09.470 --> 01:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
but would it actually potentially reduce
 
01:42:11.390 --> 01:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
uh their
 
01:42:15.390 --> 01:42:15.400 align:start position:0%
pension you know it pro quite possibly I
 
01:42:16.510 --> 01:42:16.520 align:start position:0%
mean you know because it's it's the
 
01:42:18.270 --> 01:42:18.280 align:start position:0%
lesser of the percentage in the high
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
five and the other five so yeah it could
 
01:42:24.310 --> 01:42:24.320 align:start position:0%
have an an adverse effect on on somebody
 
01:42:26.589 --> 01:42:26.599 align:start position:0%
depending on their circumstances and a
 
01:42:29.669 --> 01:42:29.679 align:start position:0%
example of that may be somebody who was
 
01:42:32.589 --> 01:42:32.599 align:start position:0%
um you know had the opportunity to you
 
01:42:35.790 --> 01:42:35.800 align:start position:0%
know do overtime and detail pay 10 years
 
01:42:38.109 --> 01:42:38.119 align:start position:0%
earlier went into Command Staff they
 
01:42:40.109 --> 01:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
were on a salary didn't get that anymore
 
01:42:42.950 --> 01:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
and they made more in their old job you
 
01:42:44.669 --> 01:42:44.679 align:start position:0%
know um you they made more in the
 
01:42:46.550 --> 01:42:46.560 align:start position:0%
cruiser than behind the desk you know
 
01:42:48.830 --> 01:42:48.840 align:start position:0%
type of thing that you know so it's
 
01:42:51.669 --> 01:42:51.679 align:start position:0%
possible okay thank you
 
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:57.310 --> 01:42:57.320 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
03:18:05.229 --> 03:18:05.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:08.630 --> 03:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
tro thank you madam chair and members of
 
03:18:12.670 --> 03:18:12.680 align:start position:0%
the Edna committee I'm representative
 
03:18:15.389 --> 03:18:15.399 align:start position:0%
District uh correction 8 out of Belmont
 
03:18:16.469 --> 03:18:16.479 align:start position:0%
tilted and
 
03:18:18.750 --> 03:18:18.760 align:start position:0%
sington today I come before you with
 
03:18:20.349 --> 03:18:20.359 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
03:18:23.790 --> 03:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
12299 FN so basically I was asked to
 
03:18:26.710 --> 03:18:26.720 align:start position:0%
bring this forward um the reason for
 
03:18:30.189 --> 03:18:30.199 align:start position:0%
this bill is currently um fire
 
03:18:32.469 --> 03:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
instructors at the Academy are in the
 
03:18:33.630 --> 03:18:33.640 align:start position:0%
group two
 
03:18:33.640 --> 03:18:35.630 align:start position:0%
group two
retirement

03:18:35.630 --> 03:18:35.640 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
03:18:38.110 --> 03:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
whereas instructors at community
 
03:18:41.590 --> 03:18:41.600 align:start position:0%
colleges that are teaching the same um
 
03:18:45.309 --> 03:18:45.319 align:start position:0%
type of um education as the um fire
 
03:18:47.590 --> 03:18:47.600 align:start position:0%
academy and not they're actually group
 
03:18:50.870 --> 03:18:50.880 align:start position:0%
one so basically um my understanding
 
03:18:54.269 --> 03:18:54.279 align:start position:0%
there's only uh one or two that are
 
03:18:58.990 --> 03:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
affected by um this so it wouldn't be a
 
03:19:02.910 --> 03:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
huge impact to the retirement or um
 
03:19:05.750 --> 03:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
would affect the group to retirement so
 
03:19:08.189 --> 03:19:08.199 align:start position:0%
at this point I'm going to have the
 
03:19:09.750 --> 03:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
person that asked me to bring this um
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
forward to speak more on this bill but I
 
03:19:16.590 --> 03:19:16.600 align:start position:0%
do ask this committee to please take a
 
03:19:18.750 --> 03:19:18.760 align:start position:0%
close look at this and hopefully we can
 
03:19:21.670 --> 03:19:21.680 align:start position:0%
pass this thank
 
03:19:25.870 --> 03:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you um I'd like to have Mr
 
03:19:28.429 --> 03:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
Carlin exp do as we did in all the other
 
03:19:30.870 --> 03:19:30.880 align:start position:0%
bills and have Mr Carlin explain explain
 
03:19:34.550 --> 03:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
the financial impact first if
 
03:19:41.030 --> 03:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:41.040 --> 03:19:50.030 align:start position:0%
 
Carlin

03:19:50.030 --> 03:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:52.309 --> 03:19:52.319 align:start position:0%
good afternoon um Marty Carlin
 
03:19:53.349 --> 03:19:53.359 align:start position:0%
representing the New Hampshire
 
03:19:56.389 --> 03:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
retirement system um nhrs doesn't have a
 
03:19:59.550 --> 03:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
position on this bill um from our
 
03:20:00.630 --> 03:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
understanding and reading the fiscal
 
03:20:03.229 --> 03:20:03.239 align:start position:0%
note from Community College it currently
 
03:20:07.670 --> 03:20:07.680 align:start position:0%
affects one member um and if you know
 
03:20:09.990 --> 03:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
basically what happens is you know there
 
03:20:11.309 --> 03:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
obviously the two member groups and
 
03:20:13.269 --> 03:20:13.279 align:start position:0%
there different defs in the statute to
 
03:20:16.150 --> 03:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
qualify for uh you know teacher police
 
03:20:19.550 --> 03:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
and fire you know it's a fairly long
 
03:20:21.269 --> 03:20:21.279 align:start position:0%
list of definitions but typically Group
 
03:20:23.670 --> 03:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
Two Fire the primary definition is
 
03:20:26.590 --> 03:20:26.600 align:start position:0%
permanent full-time firefighter with or
 
03:20:29.510 --> 03:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
others with regular exposure to the
 
03:20:32.670 --> 03:20:32.680 align:start position:0%
hazards of of firefighting um there are
 
03:20:34.870 --> 03:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
exceptions um that's the statute that's
 
03:20:38.670 --> 03:20:38.680 align:start position:0%
being amended um A3 section 3C there are
 
03:20:40.910 --> 03:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
a couple of positions in there that have
 
03:20:42.670 --> 03:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
been carved out over time time to stay
 
03:20:44.469 --> 03:20:44.479 align:start position:0%
in group two if you're bringing someone
 
03:20:47.229 --> 03:20:47.239 align:start position:0%
into the position who had prior service
 
03:20:50.990 --> 03:20:51.000 align:start position:0%
in group two of more than uh 10 years so
 
03:20:52.830 --> 03:20:52.840 align:start position:0%
um you know that's sort of the mechanics
 
03:20:54.150 --> 03:20:54.160 align:start position:0%
of it if it's not changing the
 
03:20:55.630 --> 03:20:55.640 align:start position:0%
definition of eligibility for a
 
03:20:57.469 --> 03:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
firefighter but it's adding this
 
03:20:59.870 --> 03:20:59.880 align:start position:0%
particular job position into the
 
03:21:01.630 --> 03:21:01.640 align:start position:0%
exceptions where somebody who's already
 
03:21:03.750 --> 03:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
been in group two can stay in group two
 
03:21:07.110 --> 03:21:07.120 align:start position:0%
in the position in terms of the cost uh
 
03:21:09.870 --> 03:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
basically the difference is the um
 
03:21:12.110 --> 03:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
employer rate well you know the ex the
 
03:21:15.750 --> 03:21:15.760 align:start position:0%
member rate for group Two Fire is 11.8%
 
03:21:18.670 --> 03:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
and group one is 7% but the the employer
 
03:21:21.830 --> 03:21:21.840 align:start position:0%
contribution rate is um significantly
 
03:21:26.349 --> 03:21:26.359 align:start position:0%
larger for the employer the group one
 
03:21:29.070 --> 03:21:29.080 align:start position:0%
rate for employers is
 
03:21:40.830 --> 03:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:44.670 --> 03:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
30.354701 now the reason why I think
 
03:21:47.630 --> 03:21:47.640 align:start position:0%
some of the existing car outs have been
 
03:21:49.870 --> 03:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
in there is there are certain benefits
 
03:21:52.110 --> 03:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
available only to group two members who
 
03:21:55.269 --> 03:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
retire as group two members primarily a
 
03:21:58.349 --> 03:21:58.359 align:start position:0%
50% automatic spousal allowance if they
 
03:22:00.469 --> 03:22:00.479 align:start position:0%
pass away that 50% of the pension goes
 
03:22:02.590 --> 03:22:02.600 align:start position:0%
to the spouse with no reduction there
 
03:22:05.510 --> 03:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
may be medical subsidy eligib issues as
 
03:22:08.590 --> 03:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
well so that that's sort of the draw for
 
03:22:10.870 --> 03:22:10.880 align:start position:0%
wanting to stay in group two uh for some
 
03:22:13.309 --> 03:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
reason so that's um that's pretty much
 
03:22:14.790 --> 03:22:14.800 align:start position:0%
it in a
 
03:22:14.800 --> 03:22:16.830 align:start position:0%
it in a
nutshell

03:22:16.830 --> 03:22:16.840 align:start position:0%
nutshell
 
03:22:20.269 --> 03:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh I have a question I'm
 
03:22:23.910 --> 03:22:23.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the fiscal note and that
 
03:22:25.550 --> 03:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
seems to imply that you're going to
 
03:22:28.070 --> 03:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
raise the rate for every employee in the
 
03:22:28.080 --> 03:22:29.349 align:start position:0%
raise the rate for every employee in the
community

03:22:29.349 --> 03:22:29.359 align:start position:0%
community
 
03:22:31.870 --> 03:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
system um if it was written that way
 
03:22:33.429 --> 03:22:33.439 align:start position:0%
it's not intended it would be on the
 
03:22:36.110 --> 03:22:36.120 align:start position:0%
individual who the affected individuals
 
03:22:39.830 --> 03:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
or individual who went St who what is in
 
03:22:41.630 --> 03:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
group one now and would go to group two
 
03:22:43.550 --> 03:22:43.560 align:start position:0%
this this is similar there was a
 
03:22:45.269 --> 03:22:45.279 align:start position:0%
dispatcher Bill a couple years ago that
 
03:22:47.830 --> 03:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
was the same idea okay so it's only on
 
03:22:50.189 --> 03:22:50.199 align:start position:0%
the yeah only on the person thank you
 
03:22:51.870 --> 03:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate that any other
 
03:22:51.880 --> 03:22:54.110 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate that any other
questions

03:22:54.110 --> 03:22:54.120 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:22:57.229 --> 03:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
BR thank you Madame chair on page I mean
 
03:23:00.309 --> 03:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
on line8 it says any fire instructor
 
03:23:02.309 --> 03:23:02.319 align:start position:0%
fire educator for the community college
 
03:23:04.269 --> 03:23:04.279 align:start position:0%
system what's the difference between a
 
03:23:07.590 --> 03:23:07.600 align:start position:0%
fire instructor and a fire and educator
 
03:23:10.189 --> 03:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
um I if if please correct me if I'm
 
03:23:12.269 --> 03:23:12.279 align:start position:0%
wrong anyone behind me I I think fire
 
03:23:14.469 --> 03:23:14.479 align:start position:0%
that speaks to fire academy
 
03:23:16.670 --> 03:23:16.680 align:start position:0%
instructors the community college system
 
03:23:19.510 --> 03:23:19.520 align:start position:0%
isn't you know it's it's you know the
 
03:23:21.670 --> 03:23:21.680 align:start position:0%
the you know the fire fire academy you
 
03:23:25.309 --> 03:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
know under safety okay thank you we'll
 
03:23:26.990 --> 03:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
we'll there are some people that will be
 
03:23:28.349 --> 03:23:28.359 align:start position:0%
able to
 
03:23:31.469 --> 03:23:31.479 align:start position:0%
explain okay any other questions from Mr
 
03:23:33.630 --> 03:23:33.640 align:start position:0%
Carlin representative
 
03:23:38.189 --> 03:23:38.199 align:start position:0%
O'Brien um thank you madam chair uh Mr
 
03:23:44.150 --> 03:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
Carin did we past leg lures try to fix
 
03:23:46.510 --> 03:23:46.520 align:start position:0%
something like this like in other words
 
03:23:48.670 --> 03:23:48.680 align:start position:0%
in the example fire chiefs were getting
 
03:23:51.670 --> 03:23:51.680 align:start position:0%
secretaries to join the group two type
 
03:23:53.030 --> 03:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
of pension
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
system and
 
03:23:59.510 --> 03:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
um then we de Bild uh the law was
 
03:24:01.630 --> 03:24:01.640 align:start position:0%
changed that they had to complete
 
03:24:03.910 --> 03:24:03.920 align:start position:0%
firefighter one and firefighter 2
 
03:24:07.670 --> 03:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
training in order to qualify and with
 
03:24:09.830 --> 03:24:09.840 align:start position:0%
these people that they are talking about
 
03:24:12.110 --> 03:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
if you're prepared to answer that
 
03:24:13.550 --> 03:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
could they meet the standards of
 
03:24:17.469 --> 03:24:17.479 align:start position:0%
firefighter one firefighter 2 couldn't I
 
03:24:19.790 --> 03:24:19.800 align:start position:0%
that's a question outside of my scope
 
03:24:22.189 --> 03:24:22.199 align:start position:0%
but to to your your your initial
 
03:24:26.349 --> 03:24:26.359 align:start position:0%
question my understanding is back 30 40
 
03:24:28.510 --> 03:24:28.520 align:start position:0%
50 years ago there were some positions
 
03:24:29.830 --> 03:24:29.840 align:start position:0%
because they were working for a police
 
03:24:32.070 --> 03:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
or fire department you know as an admin
 
03:24:34.030 --> 03:24:34.040 align:start position:0%
you know they were in group two and that
 
03:24:36.710 --> 03:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
that was tightened up over the
 
03:24:40.750 --> 03:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
years it's 80s early 90s time frame some
 
03:24:42.429 --> 03:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
of those type of position you know there
 
03:24:45.710 --> 03:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
were additional definitions put in for
 
03:24:47.510 --> 03:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
you know tightening up the eligibility
 
03:24:49.830 --> 03:24:49.840 align:start position:0%
but it's it's been the way it's been
 
03:24:52.309 --> 03:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
since I've been around okay
 
03:24:54.070 --> 03:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
representative O'Brien if you look at
 
03:24:57.870 --> 03:24:57.880 align:start position:0%
lines 9 10 and 11 which are existing law
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
it says that that the person has to have
 
03:25:03.469 --> 03:25:03.479 align:start position:0%
as a job requirement satisfy the
 
03:25:06.429 --> 03:25:06.439 align:start position:0%
entrance and certification
 
03:25:09.429 --> 03:25:09.439 align:start position:0%
requirements that's which is I think
 
03:25:11.550 --> 03:25:11.560 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about yeah five five
 
03:25:13.870 --> 03:25:13.880 align:start position:0%
one and two thank you madam
 
03:25:17.189 --> 03:25:17.199 align:start position:0%
chair else represent laus uh thank you
 
03:25:18.710 --> 03:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to understand if
 
03:25:21.030 --> 03:25:21.040 align:start position:0%
somebody has worked as let's say fires
 
03:25:21.990 --> 03:25:22.000 align:start position:0%
their group
 
03:25:25.110 --> 03:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
two and you know they're vested or maybe
 
03:25:27.710 --> 03:25:27.720 align:start position:0%
even eligible for retirement and then
 
03:25:29.710 --> 03:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
they take a group one job you're saying
 
03:25:32.590 --> 03:25:32.600 align:start position:0%
they actually lose some portion of what
 
03:25:34.870 --> 03:25:34.880 align:start position:0%
would have been their group two benefits
 
03:25:38.030 --> 03:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah they they would in in cases
 
03:25:39.429 --> 03:25:39.439 align:start position:0%
like that where somebody goes either
 
03:25:41.110 --> 03:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
from group one to group two or group two
 
03:25:43.389 --> 03:25:43.399 align:start position:0%
to group group one they they end up
 
03:25:45.110 --> 03:25:45.120 align:start position:0%
retiring with what we call a split
 
03:25:46.950 --> 03:25:46.960 align:start position:0%
benefit and their service in one group
 
03:25:48.710 --> 03:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
is calculated under the formulas for
 
03:25:50.469 --> 03:25:50.479 align:start position:0%
that group and their service in the
 
03:25:53.670 --> 03:25:53.680 align:start position:0%
other group is calculated you know yeah
 
03:25:56.510 --> 03:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
follow the the situation is that if you
 
03:25:59.790 --> 03:25:59.800 align:start position:0%
retire as group two you get a couple of
 
03:26:02.030 --> 03:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
specific additional benefits that you
 
03:26:05.630 --> 03:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't if you had a split pension and
 
03:26:09.710 --> 03:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
also if you do have a split pension your
 
03:26:11.790 --> 03:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
Social Security if any will will be
 
03:26:14.469 --> 03:26:14.479 align:start position:0%
severely impacted by your group two
 
03:26:17.150 --> 03:26:17.160 align:start position:0%
pension H because the federal rule in
 
03:26:19.150 --> 03:26:19.160 align:start position:0%
the C is that because you didn't have
 
03:26:21.630 --> 03:26:21.640 align:start position:0%
contributions during those years it's
 
03:26:22.910 --> 03:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
worse than that worse than that all
 
03:26:24.269 --> 03:26:24.279 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
03:26:28.110 --> 03:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
you yeah okay anyone else all right
 
03:26:29.469 --> 03:26:29.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Carlin thank you
 
03:26:29.479 --> 03:26:40.389 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Carlin thank you
representative

03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:42.630 --> 03:26:42.640 align:start position:0%
Pearson thank you madam chair for the
 
03:26:44.110 --> 03:26:44.120 align:start position:0%
record representative C Pearson
 
03:26:46.309 --> 03:26:46.319 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 13 which encompasses
 
03:26:49.630 --> 03:26:49.640 align:start position:0%
the town of dairy I have 27 years in a
 
03:26:52.030 --> 03:26:52.040 align:start position:0%
fire service I currently work as a
 
03:26:53.550 --> 03:26:53.560 align:start position:0%
lieutenant for the city of Manchester
 
03:26:57.070 --> 03:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
fire so I'm going to touch on a question
 
03:26:58.630 --> 03:26:58.640 align:start position:0%
or two that I've already heard and then
 
03:27:00.269 --> 03:27:00.279 align:start position:0%
and then we'll go from there as a
 
03:27:02.910 --> 03:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
general practice I I'm not in favor of
 
03:27:06.030 --> 03:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
this bill I I I see some some problems
 
03:27:07.950 --> 03:27:07.960 align:start position:0%
with this uh but to answer that first
 
03:27:11.830 --> 03:27:11.840 align:start position:0%
question about um the group two in their
 
03:27:14.070 --> 03:27:14.080 align:start position:0%
status looking at the language of this
 
03:27:16.429 --> 03:27:16.439 align:start position:0%
bill any permanent firefighter who has
 
03:27:18.830 --> 03:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
been a group two member in order to be a
 
03:27:20.389 --> 03:27:20.399 align:start position:0%
group two member there are minimum
 
03:27:21.670 --> 03:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
requirements that they would have had to
 
03:27:23.269 --> 03:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
have met so they would they would meet
 
03:27:26.830 --> 03:27:26.840 align:start position:0%
that in in that sense um as far as what
 
03:27:28.510 --> 03:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
the difference between a fire instructor
 
03:27:31.030 --> 03:27:31.040 align:start position:0%
and a fire educator for the community
 
03:27:33.710 --> 03:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
college system the community college
 
03:27:37.910 --> 03:27:37.920 align:start position:0%
system does not have a fire training
 
03:27:40.630 --> 03:27:40.640 align:start position:0%
grounds so when they light things on
 
03:27:43.429 --> 03:27:43.439 align:start position:0%
fire they have have to do it at the fire
 
03:27:47.110 --> 03:27:47.120 align:start position:0%
academy the folks that handle that at
 
03:27:51.070 --> 03:27:51.080 align:start position:0%
the fire academy are fire academy folks
 
03:27:52.670 --> 03:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
because they're using their facility and
 
03:27:54.710 --> 03:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
the employees at the fire academy deal
 
03:27:57.150 --> 03:27:57.160 align:start position:0%
with that so the the fire educator in
 
03:27:59.469 --> 03:27:59.479 align:start position:0%
the community college system is pretty
 
03:28:02.389 --> 03:28:02.399 align:start position:0%
much in the in a classroom environment
 
03:28:04.510 --> 03:28:04.520 align:start position:0%
which to me
 
03:28:08.429 --> 03:28:08.439 align:start position:0%
separates what they do versus what a
 
03:28:10.550 --> 03:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
fire instructor does in the sense that
 
03:28:12.110 --> 03:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
the folks at the fire Academy that are
 
03:28:14.030 --> 03:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
instructing with things that are on fire
 
03:28:15.950 --> 03:28:15.960 align:start position:0%
are in a dangerous
 
03:28:18.309 --> 03:28:18.319 align:start position:0%
environment teaching a codes class at
 
03:28:20.750 --> 03:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
the community college system's not quite
 
03:28:22.870 --> 03:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
the same they're they're doing it in a
 
03:28:24.830 --> 03:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
classroom setting so there's a
 
03:28:28.030 --> 03:28:28.040 align:start position:0%
distinction there between the two of
 
03:28:30.110 --> 03:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
those one of the interesting things
 
03:28:32.550 --> 03:28:32.560 align:start position:0%
about this bill on line 11 talks
 
03:28:35.269 --> 03:28:35.279 align:start position:0%
about that you would have to meet the
 
03:28:36.990 --> 03:28:37.000 align:start position:0%
job requirements for entrance and
 
03:28:39.110 --> 03:28:39.120 align:start position:0%
certification requirements for the
 
03:28:42.229 --> 03:28:42.239 align:start position:0%
physical conditioning that current exam
 
03:28:46.070 --> 03:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
is the cpad exam and what what this
 
03:28:48.469 --> 03:28:48.479 align:start position:0%
would say for those classroom Educators
 
03:28:51.229 --> 03:28:51.239 align:start position:0%
they would have to take the
 
03:28:55.150 --> 03:28:55.160 align:start position:0%
cpat exam and pass it in order to meet
 
03:28:55.160 --> 03:28:56.710 align:start position:0%
cpat exam and pass it in order to meet
this

03:28:56.710 --> 03:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:28:59.070 --> 03:28:59.080 align:start position:0%
requirement we're talking about the
 
03:29:00.990 --> 03:29:01.000 align:start position:0%
concept of bringing folks in that have a
 
03:29:02.830 --> 03:29:02.840 align:start position:0%
lot of years of
 
03:29:06.070 --> 03:29:06.080 align:start position:0%
experience that is going to be a hurdle
 
03:29:10.710 --> 03:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
for a lot of them right I'm 47 okay if I
 
03:29:12.750 --> 03:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
had to if unannounced I had to take that
 
03:29:15.910 --> 03:29:15.920 align:start position:0%
cpad exam right now I'd probably make it
 
03:29:17.670 --> 03:29:17.680 align:start position:0%
but I would probably be admitted to the
 
03:29:21.070 --> 03:29:21.080 align:start position:0%
hospital shortly therea so halfway
 
03:29:24.389 --> 03:29:24.399 align:start position:0%
through you know so again they would
 
03:29:25.750 --> 03:29:25.760 align:start position:0%
obviously know this ahead of time but
 
03:29:28.229 --> 03:29:28.239 align:start position:0%
this is this is now a requirement that
 
03:29:30.950 --> 03:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
is being put forward for a classroom
 
03:29:32.830 --> 03:29:32.840 align:start position:0%
educator in essence here by adding them
 
03:29:32.840 --> 03:29:33.750 align:start position:0%
educator in essence here by adding them
to

03:29:33.750 --> 03:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:29:36.670 --> 03:29:36.680 align:start position:0%
this the other situation that I I
 
03:29:40.870 --> 03:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
question in this is is an equity thing
 
03:29:44.309 --> 03:29:44.319 align:start position:0%
is as far as is this going to require
 
03:29:45.950 --> 03:29:45.960 align:start position:0%
all of the fire Educators in the
 
03:29:47.670 --> 03:29:47.680 align:start position:0%
community college system is it going to
 
03:29:50.030 --> 03:29:50.040 align:start position:0%
become optional what about the ones that
 
03:29:51.349 --> 03:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
have never served in the fire service
 
03:29:53.790 --> 03:29:53.800 align:start position:0%
that have been in the academic setting
 
03:29:56.269 --> 03:29:56.279 align:start position:0%
less than 10 years if I've got two
 
03:29:57.990 --> 03:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
people teaching the same class on
 
03:29:59.990 --> 03:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
different days one of them's in group
 
03:30:01.670 --> 03:30:01.680 align:start position:0%
two one of them's in group one they're
 
03:30:05.229 --> 03:30:05.239 align:start position:0%
doing the same thing that that causes a
 
03:30:07.710 --> 03:30:07.720 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion I think in my
 
03:30:07.720 --> 03:30:09.630 align:start position:0%
little bit of confusion I think in my
mind

03:30:09.630 --> 03:30:09.640 align:start position:0%
mind
 
03:30:13.150 --> 03:30:13.160 align:start position:0%
for keeping consistent across the board
 
03:30:15.309 --> 03:30:15.319 align:start position:0%
so I
 
03:30:18.030 --> 03:30:18.040 align:start position:0%
can I I wasn't approach with this I I
 
03:30:19.750 --> 03:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
really don't know the precipice of why
 
03:30:21.990 --> 03:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
this this was I and I apologize to
 
03:30:23.389 --> 03:30:23.399 align:start position:0%
representative charer I didn't even he
 
03:30:24.630 --> 03:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
and I haven't even really talked about
 
03:30:27.110 --> 03:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
this as to as to where this was coming
 
03:30:29.710 --> 03:30:29.720 align:start position:0%
from but there's just some logistical
 
03:30:31.910 --> 03:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
things here that I think are are not
 
03:30:34.550 --> 03:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
going to make this work
 
03:30:37.309 --> 03:30:37.319 align:start position:0%
overall thank you are there questions
 
03:30:37.319 --> 03:30:38.309 align:start position:0%
overall thank you are there questions
representative

03:30:38.309 --> 03:30:38.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:30:41.550 --> 03:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
O'Brien thank you um and and I know you
 
03:30:44.189 --> 03:30:44.199 align:start position:0%
may not be an expert in this but are
 
03:30:47.189 --> 03:30:47.199 align:start position:0%
there instructors at the Academy that
 
03:30:47.199 --> 03:30:48.429 align:start position:0%
there instructors at the Academy that
aren't

03:30:48.429 --> 03:30:48.439 align:start position:0%
aren't
 
03:30:50.950 --> 03:30:50.960 align:start position:0%
Associated you know with a full-time
 
03:30:53.150 --> 03:30:53.160 align:start position:0%
department they working within the
 
03:30:56.550 --> 03:30:56.560 align:start position:0%
volunteer oh yeah uh type of environment
 
03:30:59.670 --> 03:30:59.680 align:start position:0%
so they don't meet the annual standards
 
03:31:02.349 --> 03:31:02.359 align:start position:0%
like I think you guys in Manchester I
 
03:31:05.429 --> 03:31:05.439 align:start position:0%
know we in Nash had to meet annual
 
03:31:07.670 --> 03:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
certifications that may not be true in
 
03:31:10.189 --> 03:31:10.199 align:start position:0%
all departments across the state correct
 
03:31:11.950 --> 03:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
sure I mean one of the things that you
 
03:31:13.790 --> 03:31:13.800 align:start position:0%
you know if you live in the southern
 
03:31:15.269 --> 03:31:15.279 align:start position:0%
part of the state you you get a little
 
03:31:17.189 --> 03:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
disillusion to how everybody north of
 
03:31:19.309 --> 03:31:19.319 align:start position:0%
conquered survives the volunteer fire
 
03:31:21.110 --> 03:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
service is over 80% of the fire service
 
03:31:22.550 --> 03:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
in the state of New
 
03:31:24.990 --> 03:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and there's a lot of
 
03:31:27.750 --> 03:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
differences um
 
03:31:31.990 --> 03:31:32.000 align:start position:0%
between the career folks mostly in the
 
03:31:34.469 --> 03:31:34.479 align:start position:0%
southern part of the city and in the
 
03:31:36.389 --> 03:31:36.399 align:start position:0%
volunteer fire
 
03:31:38.469 --> 03:31:38.479 align:start position:0%
service one of the things that this
 
03:31:38.479 --> 03:31:39.950 align:start position:0%
service one of the things that this
shuts

03:31:39.950 --> 03:31:39.960 align:start position:0%
shuts
 
03:31:39.960 --> 03:31:41.710 align:start position:0%
shuts
off

03:31:41.710 --> 03:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
off
 
03:31:43.110 --> 03:31:43.120 align:start position:0%
because you would had to have been a
 
03:31:44.349 --> 03:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
member of group
 
03:31:46.550 --> 03:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
two is that if you came from the
 
03:31:48.670 --> 03:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
volunteer fire service this does not
 
03:31:49.950 --> 03:31:49.960 align:start position:0%
apply to
 
03:31:53.229 --> 03:31:53.239 align:start position:0%
you because you're never in group two so
 
03:31:55.830 --> 03:31:55.840 align:start position:0%
you've if this is not going to be a
 
03:31:59.830 --> 03:31:59.840 align:start position:0%
benefit for anybody that came from that
 
03:32:03.510 --> 03:32:03.520 align:start position:0%
part of this profession so that again as
 
03:32:05.550 --> 03:32:05.560 align:start position:0%
an equity thing you could have a fell
 
03:32:08.550 --> 03:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
that's got 20 years as a in the fire
 
03:32:09.910 --> 03:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
service in New Hampshire but came from
 
03:32:12.150 --> 03:32:12.160 align:start position:0%
the volunteer ranks teaching alongside
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
someone with 10 years who came from a
 
03:32:17.030 --> 03:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
municipality they're teaching the same
 
03:32:20.030 --> 03:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
thing but this guy is not eligible for
 
03:32:22.110 --> 03:32:22.120 align:start position:0%
this because he was a volunteer and this
 
03:32:25.150 --> 03:32:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:28.189 --> 03:32:28.199 align:start position:0%
so and in the community college setting
 
03:32:30.830 --> 03:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
I I just don't see how that works I just
 
03:32:31.830 --> 03:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
don't see
 
03:32:34.630 --> 03:32:34.640 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative
 
03:32:36.670 --> 03:32:36.680 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair thank you
 
03:32:38.830 --> 03:32:38.840 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson um for your
 
03:32:41.590 --> 03:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
testimony uh from your perspective is it
 
03:32:43.510 --> 03:32:43.520 align:start position:0%
beneficial to try to amend this at all
 
03:32:44.670 --> 03:32:44.680 align:start position:0%
to address some of the concerns that
 
03:32:45.630 --> 03:32:45.640 align:start position:0%
you're talking about or are you just
 
03:32:47.790 --> 03:32:47.800 align:start position:0%
talking about from your perspective on
 
03:32:51.389 --> 03:32:51.399 align:start position:0%
principle so what keeping in mind that
 
03:32:53.790 --> 03:32:53.800 align:start position:0%
this entire paragraph is only being
 
03:32:57.349 --> 03:32:57.359 align:start position:0%
modified in one spot very very
 
03:33:00.229 --> 03:33:00.239 align:start position:0%
small to make a modification to try to
 
03:33:02.150 --> 03:33:02.160 align:start position:0%
work around that is is would be a
 
03:33:05.750 --> 03:33:05.760 align:start position:0%
fundamental change of the entire
 
03:33:08.469 --> 03:33:08.479 align:start position:0%
section I don't think that's a good idea
 
03:33:10.030 --> 03:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
I I think that that you're you're going
 
03:33:12.110 --> 03:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
to have to do a deeper dive into a whole
 
03:33:14.229 --> 03:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
lot of other things here and taking that
 
03:33:18.110 --> 03:33:18.120 align:start position:0%
apart in a in a setting right now that
 
03:33:19.630 --> 03:33:19.640 align:start position:0%
as far as I know is working pretty well
 
03:33:21.429 --> 03:33:21.439 align:start position:0%
I I just don't think it's
 
03:33:24.910 --> 03:33:24.920 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you other questions
 
03:33:26.670 --> 03:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
thank you very
 
03:33:39.750 --> 03:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:39.760 --> 03:33:46.030 align:start position:0%
 
nurri

03:33:46.030 --> 03:33:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:48.790 --> 03:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
and get closer there we go good
 
03:33:50.790 --> 03:33:50.800 align:start position:0%
afternoon Madam chair and rest of the
 
03:33:52.870 --> 03:33:52.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh I appreciate your time this
 
03:33:55.550 --> 03:33:55.560 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Nick mccu and I'm
 
03:33:58.950 --> 03:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
that guy that we've been referring to um
 
03:34:00.870 --> 03:34:00.880 align:start position:0%
what I would like to explain is I'm here
 
03:34:04.189 --> 03:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
on my own I am a resident of Meredith um
 
03:34:06.990 --> 03:34:07.000 align:start position:0%
I am not here on behalf of my employer
 
03:34:09.229 --> 03:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
what I did want to bring up out is and
 
03:34:10.469 --> 03:34:10.479 align:start position:0%
try to answer some of the questions that
 
03:34:13.670 --> 03:34:13.680 align:start position:0%
have come up is my current role is
 
03:34:15.030 --> 03:34:15.040 align:start position:0%
actually department chair of the fire
 
03:34:16.189 --> 03:34:16.199 align:start position:0%
science program at Lakes Region
 
03:34:20.189 --> 03:34:20.199 align:start position:0%
Community College and within that role
 
03:34:22.910 --> 03:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
um as you have seen we are acutely aware
 
03:34:24.670 --> 03:34:24.680 align:start position:0%
that there is a crisis within Emergency
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
Services you yourselves as a legislator
 
03:34:30.030 --> 03:34:30.040 align:start position:0%
legislators within the state have dealt
 
03:34:31.710 --> 03:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
with this issue in trying to shore up
 
03:34:33.750 --> 03:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
the Emergency Services System you've
 
03:34:35.830 --> 03:34:35.840 align:start position:0%
taken many positive steps including the
 
03:34:38.349 --> 03:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
recent passage of House Bill 2 with some
 
03:34:41.790 --> 03:34:41.800 align:start position:0%
Senator waters's um wording that created
 
03:34:43.790 --> 03:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
actually a career development program
 
03:34:45.550 --> 03:34:45.560 align:start position:0%
and funded that program not only at the
 
03:34:48.910 --> 03:34:48.920 align:start position:0%
pity college system excuse me but also
 
03:34:50.830 --> 03:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
at the New Hampshire fire academy to try
 
03:34:53.349 --> 03:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
to once again Shore up that system I
 
03:34:54.910 --> 03:34:54.920 align:start position:0%
believe that program will make a
 
03:34:54.920 --> 03:34:56.030 align:start position:0%
believe that program will make a
significant

03:34:56.030 --> 03:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
significant
 
03:34:57.910 --> 03:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
difference as been mentioned Lakes
 
03:34:59.670 --> 03:34:59.680 align:start position:0%
Region Community College is the only
 
03:35:01.670 --> 03:35:01.680 align:start position:0%
fire science program within the state
 
03:35:03.349 --> 03:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
and we work very collaboratively with
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
the fire academy in the past two years
 
03:35:08.189 --> 03:35:08.199 align:start position:0%
we've actually doubled our program we
 
03:35:10.790 --> 03:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
now have approximately 40 incoming first
 
03:35:12.590 --> 03:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
year students and that's been for the
 
03:35:14.269 --> 03:35:14.279 align:start position:0%
past couple of years and I really hope
 
03:35:15.750 --> 03:35:15.760 align:start position:0%
that that continues especially with the
 
03:35:18.429 --> 03:35:18.439 align:start position:0%
new program in addition during our last
 
03:35:21.030 --> 03:35:21.040 align:start position:0%
search which is why this conversation uh
 
03:35:23.550 --> 03:35:23.560 align:start position:0%
came up with representative tradier is
 
03:35:25.990 --> 03:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
that we had approximately I believe
 
03:35:28.750 --> 03:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
seven instate very well-qualified
 
03:35:32.030 --> 03:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
candidates one of them being a a not a
 
03:35:34.389 --> 03:35:34.399 align:start position:0%
retiring but a fire chief that was
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
looking at retiring that thought he
 
03:35:38.150 --> 03:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
would be able to bring his knowledge to
 
03:35:39.790 --> 03:35:39.800 align:start position:0%
the community college system and not
 
03:35:43.070 --> 03:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
retire all of those instate individuals
 
03:35:44.750 --> 03:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
withdrew their applications when they
 
03:35:46.030 --> 03:35:46.040 align:start position:0%
found out that they would have to make a
 
03:35:49.309 --> 03:35:49.319 align:start position:0%
group change from group two to group one
 
03:35:51.590 --> 03:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
that meant as you've heard before a loss
 
03:35:53.830 --> 03:35:53.840 align:start position:0%
in benefits not all of them but enough
 
03:35:56.349 --> 03:35:56.359 align:start position:0%
to make a difference so we lost those
 
03:35:59.229 --> 03:35:59.239 align:start position:0%
instate candidates this bill is an
 
03:36:01.830 --> 03:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
attempt to actually address that
 
03:36:04.030 --> 03:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
shortcoming when representative Traer
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
and I discussed what some of the options
 
03:36:08.750 --> 03:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
were creating additional group two
 
03:36:10.710 --> 03:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
positions reclassifying the two
 
03:36:12.910 --> 03:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
positions that were there did not seem
 
03:36:14.950 --> 03:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate it seemed to be kind of a
 
03:36:17.030 --> 03:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
heavy-handed approach to deal with our
 
03:36:19.990 --> 03:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
issue and with our challenge so what we
 
03:36:21.830 --> 03:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
did do is some research and we found the
 
03:36:24.429 --> 03:36:24.439 align:start position:0%
RSA that is already on the books that
 
03:36:27.870 --> 03:36:27.880 align:start position:0%
provides a very narrow exception to the
 
03:36:29.910 --> 03:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
group two standard and as has been
 
03:36:31.990 --> 03:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
mentioned by several Representatives
 
03:36:34.189 --> 03:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
this isn't a cart blanch entrance into
 
03:36:36.870 --> 03:36:36.880 align:start position:0%
group two there are some very high bars
 
03:36:36.880 --> 03:36:37.710 align:start position:0%
group two there are some very high bars
to

03:36:37.710 --> 03:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:36:40.830 --> 03:36:40.840 align:start position:0%
meet some of those bars include being a
 
03:36:44.269 --> 03:36:44.279 align:start position:0%
fire 2 certified person within the state
 
03:36:46.469 --> 03:36:46.479 align:start position:0%
it also includes having 10 years at
 
03:36:49.110 --> 03:36:49.120 align:start position:0%
least experience within our state and
 
03:36:50.870 --> 03:36:50.880 align:start position:0%
there are some other additional um
 
03:36:53.469 --> 03:36:53.479 align:start position:0%
requirements as you've already heard um
 
03:36:56.510 --> 03:36:56.520 align:start position:0%
the cpat and passing the cpat is one of
 
03:36:59.790 --> 03:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
them I don't believe it would be redoing
 
03:37:02.030 --> 03:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
the cpad if you've taken it once to be a
 
03:37:03.590 --> 03:37:03.600 align:start position:0%
group two member you have to take the
 
03:37:06.110 --> 03:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
cpad so that my assumption would be
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
already be done and I completely agree I
 
03:37:09.910 --> 03:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
would not want to be taking that cpad
 
03:37:12.510 --> 03:37:12.520 align:start position:0%
again at my age that would not go well I
 
03:37:14.110 --> 03:37:14.120 align:start position:0%
would be definitely in the hospital just
 
03:37:15.309 --> 03:37:15.319 align:start position:0%
like the
 
03:37:18.229 --> 03:37:18.239 align:start position:0%
representative so like I said in our
 
03:37:22.870 --> 03:37:22.880 align:start position:0%
discussions we found RSA 100a 3
 
03:37:25.630 --> 03:37:25.640 align:start position:0%
subsection C which allowed a very narrow
 
03:37:27.710 --> 03:37:27.720 align:start position:0%
exception and that's what you see uh in
 
03:37:29.830 --> 03:37:29.840 align:start position:0%
front of you it generally states that
 
03:37:31.630 --> 03:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
any permanent fireman who has 10 years
 
03:37:34.630 --> 03:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
of experience any fire instructor
 
03:37:36.790 --> 03:37:36.800 align:start position:0%
supervisor or other technical specialist
 
03:37:39.469 --> 03:37:39.479 align:start position:0%
who has firefighting education as a job
 
03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
function can remain in the system we
 
03:37:44.950 --> 03:37:44.960 align:start position:0%
Tred to touch that law as little as
 
03:37:47.429 --> 03:37:47.439 align:start position:0%
possible because I do agree
 
03:37:49.189 --> 03:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
representative Simon that if we do try
 
03:37:52.349 --> 03:37:52.359 align:start position:0%
to do too much then we really open up a
 
03:37:55.150 --> 03:37:55.160 align:start position:0%
very large can so representative try and
 
03:37:56.590 --> 03:37:56.600 align:start position:0%
I tried to do this a little bit more
 
03:38:00.229 --> 03:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
surgically as opposed to broadly so this
 
03:38:02.469 --> 03:38:02.479 align:start position:0%
bill really seeks to clarify and make
 
03:38:04.030 --> 03:38:04.040 align:start position:0%
clear that the instructors and the
 
03:38:06.990 --> 03:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
Educators not only at the Academy but at
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
the community college that are teaching
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
the same topics while there is a little
 
03:38:13.630 --> 03:38:13.640 align:start position:0%
bit more Hands-On at the fire academy I
 
03:38:16.950 --> 03:38:16.960 align:start position:0%
do agree we still do have fire props at
 
03:38:18.870 --> 03:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
our AC at at the community college
 
03:38:21.469 --> 03:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
system including something called a
 
03:38:25.150 --> 03:38:25.160 align:start position:0%
dollhouse uh also some um alcohol props
 
03:38:26.710 --> 03:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
that we can use and actually burn within
 
03:38:30.070 --> 03:38:30.080 align:start position:0%
our classroom and a fire sprinkler prop
 
03:38:32.429 --> 03:38:32.439 align:start position:0%
so we do have some of those actually at
 
03:38:33.950 --> 03:38:33.960 align:start position:0%
the community college system but what I
 
03:38:36.150 --> 03:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
do want to emphasize is that many of the
 
03:38:37.349 --> 03:38:37.359 align:start position:0%
topics that you're going to learn in
 
03:38:39.790 --> 03:38:39.800 align:start position:0%
firefighter 1 the community college
 
03:38:42.870 --> 03:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
system our job is to make your knowledge
 
03:38:45.309 --> 03:38:45.319 align:start position:0%
deeper so take fire behavior and
 
03:38:47.710 --> 03:38:47.720 align:start position:0%
combustion you may take that at the fire
 
03:38:50.150 --> 03:38:50.160 align:start position:0%
academy I can teach that class in an
 
03:38:52.870 --> 03:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
entire semester so the academy will give
 
03:38:55.189 --> 03:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
you your foundation I'm going to give
 
03:38:57.870 --> 03:38:57.880 align:start position:0%
you the education behind it not just the
 
03:39:00.710 --> 03:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
technical aspects of how to deal with
 
03:39:04.750 --> 03:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
fires so in closing I want to reiterate
 
03:39:06.710 --> 03:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
that this bill does not create any group
 
03:39:09.910 --> 03:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
two positions it does not reclassify any
 
03:39:12.590 --> 03:39:12.600 align:start position:0%
group two positions it clarifies a
 
03:39:15.309 --> 03:39:15.319 align:start position:0%
current RSA that's already on the books
 
03:39:16.830 --> 03:39:16.840 align:start position:0%
that requires that 10 years of
 
03:39:18.469 --> 03:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
experience meeting the current
 
03:39:20.830 --> 03:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
firefighter standards within the state
 
03:39:23.670 --> 03:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
is a requirement to actually have this
 
03:39:26.110 --> 03:39:26.120 align:start position:0%
um to have this benefit or to have this
 
03:39:28.070 --> 03:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
change to remain in group
 
03:39:31.150 --> 03:39:31.160 align:start position:0%
two um without this change I'm very
 
03:39:32.910 --> 03:39:32.920 align:start position:0%
fearful that we are going to encounter
 
03:39:35.070 --> 03:39:35.080 align:start position:0%
another issue like we did a couple of
 
03:39:36.710 --> 03:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
years ago and there are only two fire
 
03:39:39.030 --> 03:39:39.040 align:start position:0%
instructors by the way at the academy
 
03:39:40.750 --> 03:39:40.760 align:start position:0%
one of the gentlemen that we were able
 
03:39:43.229 --> 03:39:43.239 align:start position:0%
to hire was a wonderful find but he was
 
03:39:45.990 --> 03:39:46.000 align:start position:0%
relocating from North Carolina so
 
03:39:47.950 --> 03:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
luckily we were able to pick up Dustin
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
which we're very grateful for um and I
 
03:39:53.990 --> 03:39:54.000 align:start position:0%
do understand that that makes one person
 
03:39:56.429 --> 03:39:56.439 align:start position:0%
potentially have been group two and one
 
03:39:58.830 --> 03:39:58.840 align:start position:0%
person not but I think within the fire
 
03:40:00.349 --> 03:40:00.359 align:start position:0%
service we understand that if you're
 
03:40:02.429 --> 03:40:02.439 align:start position:0%
doing a different role even if you're
 
03:40:04.429 --> 03:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
teaching the same topics you may get
 
03:40:06.510 --> 03:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
different benefits whether you're a fire
 
03:40:08.309 --> 03:40:08.319 align:start position:0%
officer or whether you're a firefighter
 
03:40:09.710 --> 03:40:09.720 align:start position:0%
you may get different benefits even
 
03:40:11.910 --> 03:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
working for the the same employer so
 
03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your time I I
 
03:40:14.830 --> 03:40:14.840 align:start position:0%
very much appreciate it and the
 
03:40:16.630 --> 03:40:16.640 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come and speak and I'm
 
03:40:18.229 --> 03:40:18.239 align:start position:0%
happy to try to answer questions if you
 
03:40:20.990 --> 03:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
have any I oh yes representative leus
 
03:40:24.510 --> 03:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
and then sh it okay there was a
 
03:40:26.590 --> 03:40:26.600 align:start position:0%
statement or concern uh raised by a
 
03:40:30.910 --> 03:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
previous speaker that if we pass this um
 
03:40:34.070 --> 03:40:34.080 align:start position:0%
trying to see if I get this right
 
03:40:37.469 --> 03:40:37.479 align:start position:0%
that you would no longer be able to hire
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
somebody who was not a uh
 
03:40:42.950 --> 03:40:42.960 align:start position:0%
a member of group two in New Hampshire
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
prior to this do you read that this that
 
03:40:48.389 --> 03:40:48.399 align:start position:0%
way or I do not we were able to hire any
 
03:40:50.429 --> 03:40:50.439 align:start position:0%
individual the benefit of this is that
 
03:40:52.550 --> 03:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
if we had someone with 10 years plus
 
03:40:54.710 --> 03:40:54.720 align:start position:0%
experience they would be able to go from
 
03:40:56.830 --> 03:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
their fire department to teaching the
 
03:40:58.590 --> 03:40:58.600 align:start position:0%
next generation of firefighters without
 
03:41:00.830 --> 03:41:00.840 align:start position:0%
a loss in benefits and and like I had
 
03:41:02.790 --> 03:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned we lost approximately seven
 
03:41:05.630 --> 03:41:05.640 align:start position:0%
very well qualified instate candidates
 
03:41:06.990 --> 03:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
because they did not want to lose their
 
03:41:09.110 --> 03:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
benefits so we would be able to hire
 
03:41:11.150 --> 03:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
anybody even outside group two okay
 
03:41:14.429 --> 03:41:14.439 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Shu thank you
 
03:41:18.269 --> 03:41:18.279 align:start position:0%
madam chair um of those seven candidates
 
03:41:20.950 --> 03:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
that you say you lost do you can you
 
03:41:24.189 --> 03:41:24.199 align:start position:0%
tell us do you know why they wanted to
 
03:41:26.429 --> 03:41:26.439 align:start position:0%
work for you but not for the fire
 
03:41:30.070 --> 03:41:30.080 align:start position:0%
academy um I can't answer that directly
 
03:41:32.510 --> 03:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
there is a different role within what
 
03:41:34.189 --> 03:41:34.199 align:start position:0%
I'm doing and what the fire academy is
 
03:41:36.309 --> 03:41:36.319 align:start position:0%
doing as we've discussed it's a lot more
 
03:41:39.790 --> 03:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
physical there I don't know um the exact
 
03:41:41.910 --> 03:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
answer answer to that coming into
 
03:41:43.790 --> 03:41:43.800 align:start position:0%
Academia could have been their lifelong
 
03:41:46.030 --> 03:41:46.040 align:start position:0%
dream I don't
 
03:41:50.070 --> 03:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
know followup thank you um also I'm
 
03:41:53.910 --> 03:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
curious um from the students
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
perspective uh would a person who
 
03:41:59.149 --> 03:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
graduates from your community college
 
03:42:01.229 --> 03:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
class get the same
 
03:42:03.110 --> 03:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
certification as someone who goes
 
03:42:05.710 --> 03:42:05.720 align:start position:0%
through the fire academy excellent
 
03:42:07.710 --> 03:42:07.720 align:start position:0%
question thank you we actually have two
 
03:42:09.750 --> 03:42:09.760 align:start position:0%
tracks at the community college system
 
03:42:12.110 --> 03:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
we have a certificate one-ear track and
 
03:42:14.389 --> 03:42:14.399 align:start position:0%
we have an Associates two-year track
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
both of those require our students to go
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
to the fire academy and get their
 
03:42:22.229 --> 03:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:26.189 --> 03:42:26.199 align:start position:0%
graduation thank you repres manuti
 
03:42:29.830 --> 03:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
oh thank you madam chair so to follow up
 
03:42:33.389 --> 03:42:33.399 align:start position:0%
to that question so your program is a
 
03:42:37.590 --> 03:42:37.600 align:start position:0%
feeder program to the fire academy
 
03:42:40.630 --> 03:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
yes and uh they have to in order to
 
03:42:43.429 --> 03:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
become a certified sorry followup Madam
 
03:42:48.670 --> 03:42:48.680 align:start position:0%
it's no go on yes uh so with the uh fire
 
03:42:50.349 --> 03:42:50.359 align:start position:0%
acade the students coming out of
 
03:42:53.189 --> 03:42:53.199 align:start position:0%
community college system and going to
 
03:42:56.710 --> 03:42:56.720 align:start position:0%
the fire academy that's a must for them
 
03:43:00.510 --> 03:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
to get into fire uh Department in New
 
03:43:02.750 --> 03:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire yes the certification is
 
03:43:04.750 --> 03:43:04.760 align:start position:0%
what's required and that like I
 
03:43:06.189 --> 03:43:06.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned we work very closely with the
 
03:43:08.349 --> 03:43:08.359 align:start position:0%
academy and it's a condition of our
 
03:43:11.030 --> 03:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
graduation I can't speak to what the
 
03:43:13.389 --> 03:43:13.399 align:start position:0%
employers are using for their minimum
 
03:43:17.269 --> 03:43:17.279 align:start position:0%
standards for um for hiring we've been
 
03:43:20.349 --> 03:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
put into some very um interesting times
 
03:43:22.429 --> 03:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
where it used to be a firefighter 2 and
 
03:43:24.070 --> 03:43:24.080 align:start position:0%
a paramedic is what they wanted and they
 
03:43:26.309 --> 03:43:26.319 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take anything else I think many
 
03:43:28.950 --> 03:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
departments have been rethinking that um
 
03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
to get the right person in the
 
03:43:33.750 --> 03:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
door thank
 
03:43:36.189 --> 03:43:36.199 align:start position:0%
you yes one
 
03:43:41.990 --> 03:43:42.000 align:start position:0%
more sorry madam um thank you um so how
 
03:43:44.149 --> 03:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
if a volunteer
 
03:43:46.389 --> 03:43:46.399 align:start position:0%
firefighter they have to go through the
 
03:43:46.399 --> 03:43:49.229 align:start position:0%
firefighter they have to go through the
certification

03:43:49.229 --> 03:43:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:52.750 --> 03:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
too um it depends on their department
 
03:43:54.550 --> 03:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
whether they require firefighter one and
 
03:43:57.790 --> 03:43:57.800 align:start position:0%
two to be employed or not but we have
 
03:43:59.149 --> 03:43:59.159 align:start position:0%
not only individuals that are looking
 
03:44:01.830 --> 03:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
for a full-time job we have graduated
 
03:44:04.149 --> 03:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
individuals that are just looking to be
 
03:44:05.710 --> 03:44:05.720 align:start position:0%
their volunteer and serve in their own
 
03:44:07.510 --> 03:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
Community but they may have a profession
 
03:44:09.349 --> 03:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
already um but they wanted the
 
03:44:11.070 --> 03:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
additional knowledge um and
 
03:44:13.030 --> 03:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
certifications to be an on call
 
03:44:16.110 --> 03:44:16.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:20.830 --> 03:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:24.149 --> 03:44:24.159 align:start position:0%
question Madam chair um I have a
 
03:44:27.309 --> 03:44:27.319 align:start position:0%
question uh probably coming from the
 
03:44:30.630 --> 03:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
wrong segment of society here when
 
03:44:33.149 --> 03:44:33.159 align:start position:0%
you're teaching in an an institution
 
03:44:35.469 --> 03:44:35.479 align:start position:0%
like the community college system don't
 
03:44:39.030 --> 03:44:39.040 align:start position:0%
you have to be certified as a teacher no
 
03:44:41.429 --> 03:44:41.439 align:start position:0%
not within the commity college system no
 
03:44:43.710 --> 03:44:43.720 align:start position:0%
you need to have a a background and an
 
03:44:45.950 --> 03:44:45.960 align:start position:0%
expertise within the particular field
 
03:44:47.550 --> 03:44:47.560 align:start position:0%
there are some positions like mine
 
03:44:50.870 --> 03:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
require master's degree um specifically
 
03:44:52.750 --> 03:44:52.760 align:start position:0%
the topic might be a little bit wider
 
03:44:54.670 --> 03:44:54.680 align:start position:0%
but it's those job requirements that we
 
03:44:56.750 --> 03:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
need to actually fulfill okay because I
 
03:44:58.070 --> 03:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
was going to say if they have to be
 
03:44:59.910 --> 03:44:59.920 align:start position:0%
certified as a teacher they would be in
 
03:45:04.110 --> 03:45:04.120 align:start position:0%
group one not in group we are not okay
 
03:45:04.120 --> 03:45:06.590 align:start position:0%
group one not in group we are not okay
thank

03:45:06.590 --> 03:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:09.269 --> 03:45:09.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you madam chair so if you
 
03:45:11.070 --> 03:45:11.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to to be a
 
03:45:14.030 --> 03:45:14.040 align:start position:0%
firefighter you could go directly to the
 
03:45:17.469 --> 03:45:17.479 align:start position:0%
fire academy correct correct follow up
 
03:45:20.710 --> 03:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
follow so what is the benefit of going
 
03:45:23.030 --> 03:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
to the Community College first and then
 
03:45:25.990 --> 03:45:26.000 align:start position:0%
going to the fire academy actually they
 
03:45:28.590 --> 03:45:28.600 align:start position:0%
happen at the same time so any of the
 
03:45:29.990 --> 03:45:30.000 align:start position:0%
individuals that come into our
 
03:45:31.910 --> 03:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
Associates or certificate program they
 
03:45:34.070 --> 03:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
take firefighter one and two either in
 
03:45:35.550 --> 03:45:35.560 align:start position:0%
their first semester or their second
 
03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.680 --> 03:45:40.510 align:start position:0%
 
full

03:45:40.510 --> 03:45:40.520 align:start position:0%
full
 
03:45:43.309 --> 03:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
so this is more background more detail
 
03:45:45.590 --> 03:45:45.600 align:start position:0%
on things that the academy doesn't have
 
03:45:47.110 --> 03:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
time to cover is what I got the
 
03:45:48.870 --> 03:45:48.880 align:start position:0%
impression you were saying yes if I
 
03:45:51.110 --> 03:45:51.120 align:start position:0%
misunderstood the question I apologize
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
it it's not um one or the other it's
 
03:45:57.110 --> 03:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
actually in parallel and chair Maguire
 
03:45:58.790 --> 03:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
hit it right on the head is that I have
 
03:46:00.469 --> 03:46:00.479 align:start position:0%
time to go into many of the topics
 
03:46:02.510 --> 03:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
building construction over an entire
 
03:46:04.030 --> 03:46:04.040 align:start position:0%
semester where there may be only be a
 
03:46:06.910 --> 03:46:06.920 align:start position:0%
couple of class days at the Academy
 
03:46:11.510 --> 03:46:11.520 align:start position:0%
count okay representative goalie
 
03:46:13.389 --> 03:46:13.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
03:46:15.750 --> 03:46:15.760 align:start position:0%
being here taking my
 
03:46:18.790 --> 03:46:18.800 align:start position:0%
question I just want if you could
 
03:46:20.870 --> 03:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
address the concern a little more
 
03:46:23.309 --> 03:46:23.319 align:start position:0%
because it comes to my concern as well
 
03:46:25.469 --> 03:46:25.479 align:start position:0%
as you can have two
 
03:46:27.830 --> 03:46:27.840 align:start position:0%
instructors one who was a volunteer on a
 
03:46:27.840 --> 03:46:29.710 align:start position:0%
instructors one who was a volunteer on a
volunteer

03:46:29.710 --> 03:46:29.720 align:start position:0%
volunteer
 
03:46:32.469 --> 03:46:32.479 align:start position:0%
department not in group two another
 
03:46:34.469 --> 03:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
instructor in group
 
03:46:36.550 --> 03:46:36.560 align:start position:0%
two you truly believe that there
 
03:46:38.469 --> 03:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a conflict between those two
 
03:46:40.149 --> 03:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
as one getting a better benefit than the
 
03:46:44.630 --> 03:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
other doing the same job because I don't
 
03:46:47.790 --> 03:46:47.800 align:start position:0%
see that I see you'll be back here in
 
03:46:49.670 --> 03:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
two years if you have two people in that
 
03:46:51.469 --> 03:46:51.479 align:start position:0%
saying they need the same benefit
 
03:46:52.950 --> 03:46:52.960 align:start position:0%
because it's not
 
03:46:55.710 --> 03:46:55.720 align:start position:0%
working I truly believe that that
 
03:46:57.630 --> 03:46:57.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be a conflict it should be
 
03:46:59.229 --> 03:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
something that's discussed initially at
 
03:47:01.510 --> 03:47:01.520 align:start position:0%
the outset and I'll use uh Dustin as a
 
03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
as an example Dustin has a new a North
 
03:47:06.750 --> 03:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
Carolina where Dustin came from a
 
03:47:08.950 --> 03:47:08.960 align:start position:0%
retirement the expectation that they
 
03:47:10.349 --> 03:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
should be in the same system and earn
 
03:47:11.670 --> 03:47:11.680 align:start position:0%
the same benefits I think it was
 
03:47:15.110 --> 03:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
discussed that part of this uh benefit
 
03:47:16.870 --> 03:47:16.880 align:start position:0%
process is putting yourself in that
 
03:47:19.990 --> 03:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
Harm's Way using this RSA means you've
 
03:47:21.510 --> 03:47:21.520 align:start position:0%
already done that for a minimum of 10
 
03:47:23.590 --> 03:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
years if you're first coming to our
 
03:47:26.070 --> 03:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
state I think that expectation probably
 
03:47:28.790 --> 03:47:28.800 align:start position:0%
does not track um appropriately and
 
03:47:30.630 --> 03:47:30.640 align:start position:0%
having two individuals with the with
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
different actual benefits is not going
 
03:47:35.750 --> 03:47:35.760 align:start position:0%
to be a challenge under that kind of an
 
03:47:35.760 --> 03:47:38.510 align:start position:0%
to be a challenge under that kind of an
umbrella

03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
umbrella
 
03:47:38.520 --> 03:47:42.030 align:start position:0%
umbrella
follow

03:47:42.030 --> 03:47:42.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:45.830 --> 03:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
so you think someone who
 
03:47:48.309 --> 03:47:48.319 align:start position:0%
works and is a member of group two and
 
03:47:52.630 --> 03:47:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:55.910 --> 03:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
years ought to have the ability to be
 
03:47:57.790 --> 03:47:57.800 align:start position:0%
sitting in a classroom for the next 20
 
03:47:59.830 --> 03:47:59.840 align:start position:0%
years while someone in the fire service
 
03:48:02.030 --> 03:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
does 30 years In Harm's Way and collect
 
03:48:02.950 --> 03:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
the same
 
03:48:04.990 --> 03:48:05.000 align:start position:0%
benefit I think that's what's on the
 
03:48:06.910 --> 03:48:06.920 align:start position:0%
books right now as far as the laog goes
 
03:48:09.830 --> 03:48:09.840 align:start position:0%
and it allows an individual to actually
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
have this
 
03:48:13.990 --> 03:48:14.000 align:start position:0%
benefit I can't speak more to that if an
 
03:48:15.590 --> 03:48:15.600 align:start position:0%
individual wanted to stay In Harm's Way
 
03:48:17.990 --> 03:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
for 30 years and have the same benefit
 
03:48:19.510 --> 03:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
we looked at the law that was already
 
03:48:21.429 --> 03:48:21.439 align:start position:0%
there and tried to make a a small change
 
03:48:24.189 --> 03:48:24.199 align:start position:0%
to that I completely understand your
 
03:48:25.510 --> 03:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
question and don't want to set up any
 
03:48:28.149 --> 03:48:28.159 align:start position:0%
kind of disparity but at the same time
 
03:48:29.790 --> 03:48:29.800 align:start position:0%
like I said we took a look at the RSA
 
03:48:31.910 --> 03:48:31.920 align:start position:0%
that was there and seemed to say did
 
03:48:34.590 --> 03:48:34.600 align:start position:0%
this make sense and getting the
 
03:48:36.990 --> 03:48:37.000 align:start position:0%
individual that we want to teach our
 
03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:37.790 align:start position:0%
individual that we want to teach our
next

03:48:37.790 --> 03:48:37.800 align:start position:0%
next
 
03:48:40.189 --> 03:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
Generation that's the indiv idual with a
 
03:48:44.349 --> 03:48:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:49.309 --> 03:48:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:51.750 --> 03:48:51.760 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair the last
 
03:48:53.389 --> 03:48:53.399 align:start position:0%
question just got me thinking on a
 
03:48:56.710 --> 03:48:56.720 align:start position:0%
different train so um yes if I if I'm
 
03:48:58.670 --> 03:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
reading you correctly uh the distinction
 
03:49:00.389 --> 03:49:00.399 align:start position:0%
is that they've given 10 years of
 
03:49:02.269 --> 03:49:02.279 align:start position:0%
service potentially In Harm's Way as
 
03:49:04.630 --> 03:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
differentiating them from a candidate
 
03:49:05.790 --> 03:49:05.800 align:start position:0%
that hasn't done that and therefore
 
03:49:08.070 --> 03:49:08.080 align:start position:0%
would be in a different system um what
 
03:49:11.070 --> 03:49:11.080 align:start position:0%
is the what's the average a age of an
 
03:49:12.670 --> 03:49:12.680 align:start position:0%
instructor that comes to the Institute
 
03:49:12.680 --> 03:49:14.429 align:start position:0%
instructor that comes to the Institute
to

03:49:14.429 --> 03:49:14.439 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:49:17.910 --> 03:49:17.920 align:start position:0%
teach oh um good
 
03:49:20.429 --> 03:49:20.439 align:start position:0%
question if there's only one or two it's
 
03:49:23.269 --> 03:49:23.279 align:start position:0%
a average is a very
 
03:49:26.830 --> 03:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
uh yes there's only two of us and Dustin
 
03:49:28.950 --> 03:49:28.960 align:start position:0%
and I replaced individuals that were
 
03:49:32.030 --> 03:49:32.040 align:start position:0%
there for 32 years so I don't know that
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
I can answer that
 
03:49:35.750 --> 03:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
appropriately follow up follow up yeah
 
03:49:37.710 --> 03:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
the the only reason why I'm asking the
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
question is because uh even to become
 
03:49:41.590 --> 03:49:41.600 align:start position:0%
invested in the system requires 10 years
 
03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
at this point and arguably if somebody
 
03:49:46.510 --> 03:49:46.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't going to be there for 10 years
 
03:49:48.550 --> 03:49:48.560 align:start position:0%
this might not be the best path for them
 
03:49:51.269 --> 03:49:51.279 align:start position:0%
to take anyway um so was just thinking
 
03:49:52.750 --> 03:49:52.760 align:start position:0%
about it from that angle and then
 
03:49:54.349 --> 03:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
representative goalie threw a curveball
 
03:49:55.590 --> 03:49:55.600 align:start position:0%
at me and brought it at something else
 
03:49:57.469 --> 03:49:57.479 align:start position:0%
into my mind so but I just want some
 
03:49:59.830 --> 03:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
clarification on that so thank you no
 
03:50:01.790 --> 03:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
problem thank you for the question all
 
03:50:04.830 --> 03:50:04.840 align:start position:0%
right is everyone sufficiently confused
 
03:50:06.429 --> 03:50:06.439 align:start position:0%
all right other
 
03:50:10.149 --> 03:50:10.159 align:start position:0%
questions okay yes representa f

thank you madam chair going back to the
 
03:50:15.110 --> 03:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
question why someone would want to do
 
03:50:18.750 --> 03:50:18.760 align:start position:0%
the one or the two the two
 
03:50:21.110 --> 03:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
years they're getting college credits
 
03:50:23.710 --> 03:50:23.720 align:start position:0%
for that is that is that not correct
 
03:50:25.830 --> 03:50:25.840 align:start position:0%
that is correct so that could lead to a
 
03:50:28.710 --> 03:50:28.720 align:start position:0%
bachelor some at some time in the future
 
03:50:30.630 --> 03:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
is that correct that is correct thank

Reed
 
03:51:12.870 --> 03:51:12.880 align:start position:0%
hello Madam chairman and Madam chair and
 
03:51:14.229 --> 03:51:14.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
03:51:16.429 --> 03:51:16.439 align:start position:0%
Shannon Reed and I'm here on behalf of
 
03:51:18.870 --> 03:51:18.880 align:start position:0%
the community college system of New
 
03:51:21.389 --> 03:51:21.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um the community college
 
03:51:23.389 --> 03:51:23.399 align:start position:0%
system respectfully and regretfully
 
03:51:25.790 --> 03:51:25.800 align:start position:0%
opposes uh House Bill
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
1299 it would create inequities among
 
03:51:30.750 --> 03:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
faculty positions within the community
 
03:51:33.389 --> 03:51:33.399 align:start position:0%
college system um and would create
 
03:51:34.870 --> 03:51:34.880 align:start position:0%
positions in group two that we feel do
 
03:51:36.870 --> 03:51:36.880 align:start position:0%
not do not meet the historical criteria
 
03:51:38.870 --> 03:51:38.880 align:start position:0%
for such classification I'd like to
 
03:51:41.229 --> 03:51:41.239 align:start position:0%
provide a little bit of background um
 
03:51:42.790 --> 03:51:42.800 align:start position:0%
about the relationship between the
 
03:51:45.550 --> 03:51:45.560 align:start position:0%
community college system and uh
 
03:51:48.790 --> 03:51:48.800 align:start position:0%
nhrs for much of the Community College
 
03:51:51.750 --> 03:51:51.760 align:start position:0%
systems history we were part of the
 
03:51:53.429 --> 03:51:53.439 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire part of its
 
03:51:54.990 --> 03:51:55.000 align:start position:0%
administrative structure like the
 
03:51:56.189 --> 03:51:56.199 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation or the
 
03:51:58.990 --> 03:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education ccsnh employees
 
03:52:00.710 --> 03:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
were state employees and were at the
 
03:52:03.149 --> 03:52:03.159 align:start position:0%
time classified as group one within
 
03:52:05.710 --> 03:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
nhrs legislation in
 
03:52:08.830 --> 03:52:08.840 align:start position:0%
2007 moved the community college system
 
03:52:11.389 --> 03:52:11.399 align:start position:0%
out outside of State Administration and
 
03:52:13.469 --> 03:52:13.479 align:start position:0%
vested governance Authority in a Board
 
03:52:13.479 --> 03:52:14.269 align:start position:0%
vested governance Authority in a Board
of

03:52:14.269 --> 03:52:14.279 align:start position:0%
of
 
03:52:16.550 --> 03:52:16.560 align:start position:0%
Trustees however the community college
 
03:52:19.670 --> 03:52:19.680 align:start position:0%
system remained an employer within nhrs
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
and employees continue to be classified
 
03:52:24.229 --> 03:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
as group one employees and in my written
 
03:52:26.229 --> 03:52:26.239 align:start position:0%
testimony I will um provide you with the
 
03:52:28.349 --> 03:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
relevant statutory citations for for
 
03:52:28.359 --> 03:52:29.510 align:start position:0%
relevant statutory citations for for
that

03:52:29.510 --> 03:52:29.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:52:32.030 --> 03:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
relationship House Bill 1299 would
 
03:52:33.870 --> 03:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
extend group two status to fire
 
03:52:35.269 --> 03:52:35.279 align:start position:0%
instructors within New Hampshire's
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
community college system we have the
 
03:52:39.750 --> 03:52:39.760 align:start position:0%
only the state's only only associate
 
03:52:41.550 --> 03:52:41.560 align:start position:0%
degree and certificate programs in fire
 
03:52:42.910 --> 03:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
science offered at Lakes Region
 
03:52:45.309 --> 03:52:45.319 align:start position:0%
Community College in lonia it is an
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
exceptional and valuable program within
 
03:52:49.149 --> 03:52:49.159 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire and for every
 
03:52:50.750 --> 03:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
municipality that depends on First
 
03:52:53.349 --> 03:52:53.359 align:start position:0%
Responders and we are extremely proud of
 
03:52:55.830 --> 03:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
it while we understand the challenges
 
03:52:57.510 --> 03:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
associated with uh recruiting
 
03:53:00.309 --> 03:53:00.319 align:start position:0%
instructors as as were discussed by the
 
03:53:02.229 --> 03:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
previous speaker we don't support
 
03:53:03.630 --> 03:53:03.640 align:start position:0%
legislation that treats one type of
 
03:53:05.070 --> 03:53:05.080 align:start position:0%
faculty member differently than the
 
03:53:08.269 --> 03:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
others across ccsnh these are instructor
 
03:53:10.149 --> 03:53:10.159 align:start position:0%
positions they're not positions where
 
03:53:11.630 --> 03:53:11.640 align:start position:0%
the individual can be called into
 
03:53:13.309 --> 03:53:13.319 align:start position:0%
Service as a first responder which is
 
03:53:14.910 --> 03:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
the basis for group two
 
03:53:16.990 --> 03:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
classification while the fiscal impact
 
03:53:19.349 --> 03:53:19.359 align:start position:0%
is modest we're also concerned that this
 
03:53:21.309 --> 03:53:21.319 align:start position:0%
legislation could open the door to other
 
03:53:23.309 --> 03:53:23.319 align:start position:0%
faculty groups seeking similar
 
03:53:25.590 --> 03:53:25.600 align:start position:0%
reclassifications based on recruitment
 
03:53:27.630 --> 03:53:27.640 align:start position:0%
objectives thank you and I would be
 
03:53:29.149 --> 03:53:29.159 align:start position:0%
happy to take any
 
03:53:33.309 --> 03:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:35.670 --> 03:53:35.680 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
03:53:38.550 --> 03:53:38.560 align:start position:0%
Manti thank you madam chair so when you
 
03:53:41.750 --> 03:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
talk about about uh creating uh opening
 
03:53:47.590 --> 03:53:47.600 align:start position:0%
the door for other uh fields in uh
 
03:53:49.910 --> 03:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
Community College systems are you
 
03:53:52.830 --> 03:53:52.840 align:start position:0%
thinking in terms of Criminal Justice
 
03:53:55.750 --> 03:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
courses coursework
 
03:54:00.030 --> 03:54:00.040 align:start position:0%
or any other which are first responder
 
03:54:02.469 --> 03:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
thing I'm thinking specifically in terms
 
03:54:05.429 --> 03:54:05.439 align:start position:0%
of our uh criminal justice programs
 
03:54:09.349 --> 03:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Simon thank you madam
 
03:54:11.910 --> 03:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for testifying today um
 
03:54:13.550 --> 03:54:13.560 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to ask a a clarifying
 
03:54:16.229 --> 03:54:16.239 align:start position:0%
question I suppose on uh your comment
 
03:54:18.110 --> 03:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
that you didn't want to create different
 
03:54:19.790 --> 03:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
benefits for different people with in
 
03:54:23.149 --> 03:54:23.159 align:start position:0%
the system itself um from your
 
03:54:25.990 --> 03:54:26.000 align:start position:0%
perspective if we weren't to pass a bill
 
03:54:29.030 --> 03:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
like this would that not also happen um
 
03:54:30.710 --> 03:54:30.720 align:start position:0%
because somebody who's coming with a
 
03:54:32.389 --> 03:54:32.399 align:start position:0%
group to say somebody worked 15 years
 
03:54:34.110 --> 03:54:34.120 align:start position:0%
for the fire service they're already
 
03:54:35.790 --> 03:54:35.800 align:start position:0%
vested as a group two employee and
 
03:54:37.429 --> 03:54:37.439 align:start position:0%
they're coming with their group two
 
03:54:39.950 --> 03:54:39.960 align:start position:0%
retirement benefits that group two
 
03:54:41.229 --> 03:54:41.239 align:start position:0%
benefit that they've achieved is going
 
03:54:43.550 --> 03:54:43.560 align:start position:0%
to be affected in a different way by
 
03:54:44.990 --> 03:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to group one that a group one
 
03:54:47.750 --> 03:54:47.760 align:start position:0%
person doesn't have to deal with is that
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
correct I think I would defer to Mr
 
03:54:54.389 --> 03:54:54.399 align:start position:0%
Carlin to answer that question M Mr
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
Carlin if you move within groups and it
 
03:55:07.189 --> 03:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:10.110 --> 03:55:10.120 align:start position:0%
are really short answer but you know if
 
03:55:12.830 --> 03:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
you have service in both groups over the
 
03:55:14.189 --> 03:55:14.199 align:start position:0%
course of your career you're going to
 
03:55:18.269 --> 03:55:18.279 align:start position:0%
retire from the group your last position
 
03:55:20.630 --> 03:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
and there are some differences and and
 
03:55:22.870 --> 03:55:22.880 align:start position:0%
um supplemental besides the pension
 
03:55:25.269 --> 03:55:25.279 align:start position:0%
formulas there some ancillary benefits
 
03:55:27.269 --> 03:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
for group two that if you retired in
 
03:55:28.790 --> 03:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
group one you wouldn't receive so that's
 
03:55:30.910 --> 03:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
that's the
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
difference um my major concern is with
 
03:55:37.349 --> 03:55:37.359 align:start position:0%
the interaction with Social Security um
 
03:55:39.030 --> 03:55:39.040 align:start position:0%
because the social security benefit will
 
03:55:41.070 --> 03:55:41.080 align:start position:0%
affect the group two benefit will it not
 
03:55:42.590 --> 03:55:42.600 align:start position:0%
if they if they take on another 20 years
 
03:55:44.590 --> 03:55:44.600 align:start position:0%
of social security benefit how will that
 
03:55:45.990 --> 03:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
impact their group two benefit they
 
03:55:48.870 --> 03:55:48.880 align:start position:0%
previously affect their group to benefit
 
03:55:50.710 --> 03:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
it will affect their social security
 
03:55:52.349 --> 03:55:52.359 align:start position:0%
right so that either either way that's
 
03:55:54.550 --> 03:55:54.560 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying it they're going to lose
 
03:55:57.229 --> 03:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
some benefit aren't they yeah well
 
03:55:59.590 --> 03:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
there's the the the nhrs benefits is all
 
03:56:01.110 --> 03:56:01.120 align:start position:0%
I can speak to is what what they would
 
03:56:03.349 --> 03:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
lose there there is groups who isn't
 
03:56:05.349 --> 03:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't contribute to Social Security in
 
03:56:07.349 --> 03:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire right um and there is
 
03:56:09.110 --> 03:56:09.120 align:start position:0%
something under the social secur law
 
03:56:11.469 --> 03:56:11.479 align:start position:0%
called the windfall elimination weap uh
 
03:56:14.990 --> 03:56:15.000 align:start position:0%
provision where by the years outside of
 
03:56:17.349 --> 03:56:17.359 align:start position:0%
Social Security if you worked enough
 
03:56:19.510 --> 03:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
quarters to get Social Security that
 
03:56:20.950 --> 03:56:20.960 align:start position:0%
Social Security amount is going to be
 
03:56:23.389 --> 03:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
offset by the the period outside the
 
03:56:27.550 --> 03:56:27.560 align:start position:0%
system I mean if you work 28 years and
 
03:56:28.910 --> 03:56:28.920 align:start position:0%
you could you know it's it's a sliding
 
03:56:31.229 --> 03:56:31.239 align:start position:0%
scale and it's very complicated so that
 
03:56:33.590 --> 03:56:33.600 align:start position:0%
that affects all group two members now
 
03:56:36.030 --> 03:56:36.040 align:start position:0%
as as a as a as a thing but your
 
03:56:37.870 --> 03:56:37.880 align:start position:0%
question did raise another point and
 
03:56:40.309 --> 03:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
this is that's put it back to you
 
03:56:42.510 --> 03:56:42.520 align:start position:0%
because you probably but um if the
 
03:56:44.469 --> 03:56:44.479 align:start position:0%
position becomes group two although you
 
03:56:46.710 --> 03:56:46.720 align:start position:0%
know this is a social security employer
 
03:56:48.070 --> 03:56:48.080 align:start position:0%
would this be a group two position that
 
03:56:50.030 --> 03:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
was also contributing to Social Security
 
03:56:52.229 --> 03:56:52.239 align:start position:0%
that I don't know that but I as you
 
03:56:55.670 --> 03:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
brought it up it's might happen an
 
03:56:58.870 --> 03:56:58.880 align:start position:0%
interesting yeah okay thank you for your
 
03:57:00.269 --> 03:57:00.279 align:start position:0%

again I'm a retired captain from the

the New Hampshire retirement
 
03:57:53.710 --> 03:57:53.720 align:start position:0%
system uh we are in opposition of House
 
03:57:53.720 --> 03:57:54.550 align:start position:0%
system uh we are in opposition of House
Bill

03:57:54.550 --> 03:57:54.560 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:57:57.630 --> 03:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
1299 um and the reasoning
 
03:58:01.469 --> 03:58:01.479 align:start position:0%
is uh the reason why group two evolved
 
03:58:05.070 --> 03:58:05.080 align:start position:0%
back in 1974 when we got the 20year bill
 
03:58:08.830 --> 03:58:08.840 align:start position:0%
was because of um H the hazards of the
 
03:58:11.070 --> 03:58:11.080 align:start position:0%
job and the life expectancy when I was
 
03:58:12.990 --> 03:58:13.000 align:start position:0%
on the Retirement Board we actually used
 
03:58:14.790 --> 03:58:14.800 align:start position:0%
a different mortality table for
 
03:58:16.950 --> 03:58:16.960 align:start position:0%
firefighters because our life expectancy
 
03:58:19.030 --> 03:58:19.040 align:start position:0%
was shorter than a normal population by
 
03:58:21.429 --> 03:58:21.439 align:start position:0%
some 10 years and it has to do with the
 
03:58:23.469 --> 03:58:23.479 align:start position:0%
stresses and the physical activity that
 
03:58:25.630 --> 03:58:25.640 align:start position:0%
we have to go through uh when you have a
 
03:58:27.870 --> 03:58:27.880 align:start position:0%
controlled environment teaching in a
 
03:58:30.750 --> 03:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
classroom um you honestly you can have
 
03:58:32.790 --> 03:58:32.800 align:start position:0%
almost any teacher in a state say that
 
03:58:35.870 --> 03:58:35.880 align:start position:0%
they have um stressors in the classroom
 
03:58:37.870 --> 03:58:37.880 align:start position:0%
so where does that stop uh back in the
 
03:58:41.389 --> 03:58:41.399 align:start position:0%
90s they did a reclassification and they
 
03:58:43.670 --> 03:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
took a lot of people out of group two
 
03:58:46.269 --> 03:58:46.279 align:start position:0%
that they felt did not meet the criteria
 
03:58:49.790 --> 03:58:49.800 align:start position:0%
of rigor and and um and Hazard we had
 
03:58:51.870 --> 03:58:51.880 align:start position:0%
our dispatchers used to be in group two
 
03:58:54.550 --> 03:58:54.560 align:start position:0%
our mechanics used to be in group two um
 
03:58:55.830 --> 03:58:55.840 align:start position:0%
the mechanics they actually in
 
03:58:57.950 --> 03:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
Manchester they go to fire scene and
 
03:58:59.269 --> 03:58:59.279 align:start position:0%
they're you know they're working on
 
03:59:00.590 --> 03:59:00.600 align:start position:0%
equipment and everything right there at
 
03:59:02.950 --> 03:59:02.960 align:start position:0%
the fire scene um but they were taken
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
out of group to um and again it's
 
03:59:09.389 --> 03:59:09.399 align:start position:0%
because of the job um when you look at
 
03:59:09.399 --> 03:59:10.910 align:start position:0%
because of the job um when you look at
uh

03:59:10.910 --> 03:59:10.920 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:15.110 --> 03:59:15.120 align:start position:0%
um the the rate if if take for instance
 
03:59:17.149 --> 03:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
a group one person Works 30 years they
 
03:59:19.630 --> 03:59:19.640 align:start position:0%
would get 50% of their salary but they'
 
03:59:21.870 --> 03:59:21.880 align:start position:0%
be eligible for full full-time Social
 
03:59:23.990 --> 03:59:24.000 align:start position:0%
Security full Social Security where a
 
03:59:26.229 --> 03:59:26.239 align:start position:0%
group two member the same 30 years under
 
03:59:28.750 --> 03:59:28.760 align:start position:0%
the existing law uh depending I'm
 
03:59:30.590 --> 03:59:30.600 align:start position:0%
talking about new hires after
 
03:59:33.750 --> 03:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
2012 uh would get 60% but with no help
 
03:59:36.389 --> 03:59:36.399 align:start position:0%
with no social security and then if you
 
03:59:37.990 --> 03:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
if the with the change if somebody came
 
03:59:40.149 --> 03:59:40.159 align:start position:0%
into the college system and they had 10
 
03:59:42.070 --> 03:59:42.080 align:start position:0%
years of group two and then they did
 
03:59:44.670 --> 03:59:44.680 align:start position:0%
another 20 years in group one and that's
 
03:59:46.590 --> 03:59:46.600 align:start position:0%
why we have split benefits they would
 
03:59:46.600 --> 03:59:48.269 align:start position:0%
why we have split benefits they would
get

03:59:48.269 --> 03:59:48.279 align:start position:0%
get
 
03:59:51.149 --> 03:59:51.159 align:start position:0%
53.4% on the as a pension and they would
 
03:59:54.830 --> 03:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
also be eligible for Social Security so
 
03:59:58.269 --> 03:59:58.279 align:start position:0%
um I think the way the law reads now is
 
04:00:00.030 --> 04:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
we should leave it the way it is I I
 
04:00:01.790 --> 04:00:01.800 align:start position:0%
don't we don't want to see group two
 
04:00:04.670 --> 04:00:04.680 align:start position:0%
getting watered down anymore uh because
 
04:00:07.149 --> 04:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
that's what happened back in the 70s and
 
04:00:09.389 --> 04:00:09.399 align:start position:0%
80s people wanted to jump into group two
 
04:00:10.990 --> 04:00:11.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of it was because of cost it was
 
04:00:12.389 --> 04:00:12.399 align:start position:0%
cheaper to be in group two than it was
 
04:00:15.950 --> 04:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
in group one um but uh as far as the
 
04:00:18.990 --> 04:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
benefit structure I I would question
 
04:00:21.790 --> 04:00:21.800 align:start position:0%
once you reach 65 years old if group two
 
04:00:24.590 --> 04:00:24.600 align:start position:0%
is any better than group one uh when you
 
04:00:27.910 --> 04:00:27.920 align:start position:0%
take consideration social security so
 
04:00:30.550 --> 04:00:30.560 align:start position:0%
for those reasons um we oppose the bill
 
04:00:32.630 --> 04:00:32.640 align:start position:0%
and we would hope that the committee um
 
04:00:34.670 --> 04:00:34.680 align:start position:0%
itls it thank you and I'll take any
 
04:00:36.710 --> 04:00:36.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much are there
 
04:00:39.269 --> 04:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:00:41.349 --> 04:00:41.359 align:start position:0%
no thank you thank is thanks again is
 
04:00:43.790 --> 04:00:43.800 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
04:01:07.229 --> 04:01:07.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:07.239 --> 04:01:09.630 align:start position:0%
 
Pro

04:01:09.630 --> 04:01:09.640 align:start position:0%
Pro
 
04:01:18.710 --> 04:01:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:21.269 --> 04:01:21.279 align:start position:0%
okay good afternoon Madam chair and
 
04:01:24.710 --> 04:01:24.720 align:start position:0%
members of the committee uh I'm Mark PR
 
04:01:30.710 --> 04:01:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative Mark f um Hillboro 15 I'm
 
04:01:34.630 --> 04:01:34.640 align:start position:0%
also uh a deputy chief in the town of
 
04:01:37.030 --> 04:01:37.040 align:start position:0%
eeping and that is one of the main
 
04:01:41.070 --> 04:01:41.080 align:start position:0%
reasons I put this bill in is because
 
04:01:43.670 --> 04:01:43.680 align:start position:0%
departments especially in that I know of
 
04:01:48.670 --> 04:01:48.680 align:start position:0%
in my area are having uh trouble getting
 
04:01:50.550 --> 04:01:50.560 align:start position:0%
people to fill our
 
04:01:50.560 --> 04:01:53.349 align:start position:0%
people to fill our
shifts

04:01:53.349 --> 04:01:53.359 align:start position:0%
shifts
 
04:01:55.710 --> 04:01:55.720 align:start position:0%
uh the newer
 
04:01:58.710 --> 04:01:58.720 align:start position:0%
generation doesn't like to work
 
04:02:02.229 --> 04:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
overtime uh at five minutes of six they
 
04:02:06.030 --> 04:02:06.040 align:start position:0%
standing by the door ready to leave um
 
04:02:06.040 --> 04:02:07.149 align:start position:0%
standing by the door ready to leave um
but

04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:02:09.469 --> 04:02:09.479 align:start position:0%
retirees will
 
04:02:14.429 --> 04:02:14.439 align:start position:0%
work um so I asked for the hours
 
04:02:16.790 --> 04:02:16.800 align:start position:0%
to uh be
 
04:02:19.830 --> 04:02:19.840 align:start position:0%
increased so that we have the
 
04:02:22.070 --> 04:02:22.080 align:start position:0%
opportunity to use the
 
04:02:25.590 --> 04:02:25.600 align:start position:0%
retirees to help fill these
 
04:02:28.229 --> 04:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
positions I know most of the departments
 
04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
in our area work 12-hour
 
04:02:37.670 --> 04:02:37.680 align:start position:0%
shifts so I put it in increments of 12
 
04:02:40.750 --> 04:02:40.760 align:start position:0%
in the increase for a
 
04:02:40.760 --> 04:02:42.750 align:start position:0%
in the increase for a
year

04:02:42.750 --> 04:02:42.760 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:02:45.349 --> 04:02:45.359 align:start position:0%
and I know this probably won't be very
 
04:02:48.590 --> 04:02:48.600 align:start position:0%
popular but some of the reasons
 
04:02:51.830 --> 04:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
that um we're not getting candidates
 
04:02:54.429 --> 04:02:54.439 align:start position:0%
knocking down our doors to come get
 
04:02:57.389 --> 04:02:57.399 align:start position:0%
hired at our fire departments is because
 
04:02:59.750 --> 04:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
of the changes that happened in our
 
04:03:02.750 --> 04:03:02.760 align:start position:0%
retirement system a lot of them are are
 
04:03:05.590 --> 04:03:05.600 align:start position:0%
headed to Massachusetts I know some of
 
04:03:07.830 --> 04:03:07.840 align:start position:0%
them have even left early to head to
 
04:03:07.840 --> 04:03:08.910 align:start position:0%
them have even left early to head to
Mass

04:03:08.910 --> 04:03:08.920 align:start position:0%
Mass
 
04:03:11.269 --> 04:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts where we used to think
 
04:03:13.750 --> 04:03:13.760 align:start position:0%
their retirement was horrible but it is
 
04:03:18.309 --> 04:03:18.319 align:start position:0%
now better than ours so um we are in a
 
04:03:22.269 --> 04:03:22.279 align:start position:0%
really tough position to recruit and
 
04:03:25.870 --> 04:03:25.880 align:start position:0%
retain members so we're looking to some
 
04:03:28.670 --> 04:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
of the uh retirees to come help us
 
04:03:31.710 --> 04:03:31.720 align:start position:0%
out it does have a a
 
04:03:34.469 --> 04:03:34.479 align:start position:0%
10-year uh sunset provision because I
 
04:03:36.710 --> 04:03:36.720 align:start position:0%
don't want this to go forever and I'm
 
04:03:38.790 --> 04:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
hoping that we can
 
04:03:42.070 --> 04:03:42.080 align:start position:0%
over those 10 years make our retirement
 
04:03:45.110 --> 04:03:45.120 align:start position:0%
system a little more attractive or
 
04:03:47.269 --> 04:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
whatever to get more people to come back
 
04:03:49.710 --> 04:03:49.720 align:start position:0%
to our state to fill these positions and
 
04:03:51.710 --> 04:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
police Fire

thank you madam chair again Marty Carlin
 
04:04:22.229 --> 04:04:22.239 align:start position:0%
representing nhrs uh nhrs doesn't have a
 
04:04:24.189 --> 04:04:24.199 align:start position:0%
position on this bill I I signed up to
 
04:04:25.469 --> 04:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
give a little bit of background on the
 
04:04:27.670 --> 04:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
current working after retirement
 
04:04:29.510 --> 04:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
landscape and answer any questions folks
 
04:04:33.389 --> 04:04:33.399 align:start position:0%
might have uh the most recent changes to
 
04:04:36.309 --> 04:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
the uh rules governing retirees working
 
04:04:37.990 --> 04:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
part-time for participating employ EMP
 
04:04:40.030 --> 04:04:40.040 align:start position:0%
lawyers and collecting a pension were
 
04:04:44.670 --> 04:04:44.680 align:start position:0%
enacted in 2018 effective 1 of 19 uh
 
04:04:49.030 --> 04:04:49.040 align:start position:0%
that set a limit for of 1352 hours per
 
04:04:52.910 --> 04:04:52.920 align:start position:0%
calendar year for um any
 
04:04:54.870 --> 04:04:54.880 align:start position:0%
retirees taking on you know
 
04:04:56.830 --> 04:04:56.840 align:start position:0%
post-retirement employment after that
 
04:04:59.030 --> 04:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
point uh there was a grandfathering
 
04:05:00.990 --> 04:05:01.000 align:start position:0%
provision included in that statute that
 
04:05:04.189 --> 04:05:04.199 align:start position:0%
any retire already working part-time for
 
04:05:07.189 --> 04:05:07.199 align:start position:0%
a participating employer uh was allowed
 
04:05:08.750 --> 04:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
to work
 
04:05:12.429 --> 04:05:12.439 align:start position:0%
1664 hours in a calendar year uh and as
 
04:05:13.910 --> 04:05:13.920 align:start position:0%
long as they stayed in that same
 
04:05:15.830 --> 04:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
position with that same employer so
 
04:05:17.630 --> 04:05:17.640 align:start position:0%
there there are some folks who were
 
04:05:19.950 --> 04:05:19.960 align:start position:0%
still in that grandfathered status that
 
04:05:22.030 --> 04:05:22.040 align:start position:0%
you know that number is closed pool as
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
of one one of 19 and will continue to
 
04:05:27.990 --> 04:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
drop 1352 averages out to 26 hours a
 
04:05:30.790 --> 04:05:30.800 align:start position:0%
week but it is not a weekly limit um
 
04:05:33.469 --> 04:05:33.479 align:start position:0%
there was a weekly limit prior and that
 
04:05:35.149 --> 04:05:35.159 align:start position:0%
caused different different issues for
 
04:05:37.990 --> 04:05:38.000 align:start position:0%
different both members and employers so
 
04:05:39.790 --> 04:05:39.800 align:start position:0%
the legislature replace that within a
 
04:05:41.790 --> 04:05:41.800 align:start position:0%
calendar year limit of
 
04:05:43.950 --> 04:05:43.960 align:start position:0%
1352 with the grandfathering which
 
04:05:47.269 --> 04:05:47.279 align:start position:0%
averages out to 32 hours a week uh this
 
04:05:50.149 --> 04:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
provision is 1872 hours in a calendar
 
04:05:52.550 --> 04:05:52.560 align:start position:0%
year which averages out to 36 hours a
 
04:05:55.910 --> 04:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
week um we'll point out that there there
 
04:05:59.349 --> 04:05:59.359 align:start position:0%
is no definition of full-time in our
 
04:06:01.429 --> 04:06:01.439 align:start position:0%
statute RSA 100a it says you know
 
04:06:04.469 --> 04:06:04.479 align:start position:0%
full-time permanent positions but we
 
04:06:07.030 --> 04:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
have administrative rules uh that were
 
04:06:10.149 --> 04:06:10.159 align:start position:0%
promulgated back in the 90s that put put
 
04:06:13.110 --> 04:06:13.120 align:start position:0%
hourly limits definitions a definition
 
04:06:14.630 --> 04:06:14.640 align:start position:0%
of a full-time teacher is regularly
 
04:06:17.550 --> 04:06:17.560 align:start position:0%
scheduled 30 hours or more a week uh
 
04:06:21.269 --> 04:06:21.279 align:start position:0%
employee um could be 35 37 and a half or
 
04:06:23.309 --> 04:06:23.319 align:start position:0%
40 depending on the employer and then
 
04:06:25.510 --> 04:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
for group two it's as defined by the
 
04:06:26.950 --> 04:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
employer and that's you know because of
 
04:06:29.349 --> 04:06:29.359 align:start position:0%
the way the shifts work uh that way so
 
04:06:31.590 --> 04:06:31.600 align:start position:0%
you know there's a so there there's a by
 
04:06:35.229 --> 04:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
rule there's a distinction so 36 already
 
04:06:37.750 --> 04:06:37.760 align:start position:0%
exceeds the um you know the minim
 
04:06:39.870 --> 04:06:39.880 align:start position:0%
minimum participation standard in the
 
04:06:43.189 --> 04:06:43.199 align:start position:0%
rule for you know teachers and employees
 
04:06:46.910 --> 04:06:46.920 align:start position:0%
um so so that's problematic for us you
 
04:06:49.189 --> 04:06:49.199 align:start position:0%
know our as we've testified in the past
 
04:06:52.670 --> 04:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
about these bills our only concern about
 
04:06:55.670 --> 04:06:55.680 align:start position:0%
how much and how how long and and uh
 
04:06:58.750 --> 04:06:58.760 align:start position:0%
retirees can work after retirement is if
 
04:07:00.510 --> 04:07:00.520 align:start position:0%
the distinction between part-time and
 
04:07:03.670 --> 04:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
full-time is is blurred too closely
 
04:07:05.790 --> 04:07:05.800 align:start position:0%
you'd have people essentially working a
 
04:07:08.910 --> 04:07:08.920 align:start position:0%
career retiring doing the same job for
 
04:07:10.429 --> 04:07:10.439 align:start position:0%
two or three hours less a week
 
04:07:12.189 --> 04:07:12.199 align:start position:0%
collecting a pension from
 
04:07:14.990 --> 04:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
us since it's it's part-time there would
 
04:07:16.950 --> 04:07:16.960 align:start position:0%
be no contributions coming in on that
 
04:07:19.550 --> 04:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
position and it you know if enough of
 
04:07:21.229 --> 04:07:21.239 align:start position:0%
that those occurrences happen you know
 
04:07:22.710 --> 04:07:22.720 align:start position:0%
it could collapse upon itself and the
 
04:07:25.070 --> 04:07:25.080 align:start position:0%
rates would Skyrocket for those with
 
04:07:27.510 --> 04:07:27.520 align:start position:0%
full-time members so that's you know
 
04:07:29.149 --> 04:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
that's that's the scenario that that we
 
04:07:31.830 --> 04:07:31.840 align:start position:0%
always try to put out so i' be glad to
 
04:07:33.030 --> 04:07:33.040 align:start position:0%
answer any
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representive
 
04:07:39.070 --> 04:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
goalie thank thank you madam
 
04:07:42.429 --> 04:07:42.439 align:start position:0%
share Marty I'm looking at the paper you
 
04:07:44.469 --> 04:07:44.479 align:start position:0%
handed out I want to make sure I'm
 
04:07:46.349 --> 04:07:46.359 align:start position:0%
reading this
 
04:07:46.359 --> 04:07:49.550 align:start position:0%
reading this
correctly

04:07:49.550 --> 04:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:54.030 --> 04:07:54.040 align:start position:0%
So currently you can work up to
 
04:07:58.670 --> 04:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
1352 hours a year and if I look at your
 
04:08:02.469 --> 04:08:02.479 align:start position:0%
paper it says the average annual hours
 
04:08:04.790 --> 04:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
per either police officer or fire police
 
04:08:07.309 --> 04:08:07.319 align:start position:0%
is 669 which is not even half of what
 
04:08:10.149 --> 04:08:10.159 align:start position:0%
they could work and fires 488 almost a
 
04:08:12.109 --> 04:08:12.119 align:start position:0%
third of what they're able to work is am
 
04:08:13.870 --> 04:08:13.880 align:start position:0%
I reading that correctly you you are
 
04:08:15.510 --> 04:08:15.520 align:start position:0%
actually I G I brought a copy from
 
04:08:17.109 --> 04:08:17.119 align:start position:0%
myself for my notes which I gave to
 
04:08:18.309 --> 04:08:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire so I don't have
 
04:08:19.990 --> 04:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
it anymore do you have an extra
 
04:08:22.030 --> 04:08:22.040 align:start position:0%
copy uh
 
04:08:24.030 --> 04:08:24.040 align:start position:0%
certainly yeah there should be
 
04:08:24.040 --> 04:08:25.910 align:start position:0%
certainly yeah there should be
one

04:08:25.910 --> 04:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
one
 
04:08:28.469 --> 04:08:28.479 align:start position:0%
yes thank you and I had copies made for
 
04:08:29.870 --> 04:08:29.880 align:start position:0%
the committee because I thought that was
 
04:08:29.880 --> 04:08:30.830 align:start position:0%
the committee because I thought that was
useful

04:08:30.830 --> 04:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
useful
 
04:08:30.840 --> 04:08:32.550 align:start position:0%
useful
information

04:08:32.550 --> 04:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:08:35.070 --> 04:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
so so yeah the the chart you're
 
04:08:36.790 --> 04:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
referring to this is a report we put
 
04:08:39.269 --> 04:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
together on the calend calend year 22
 
04:08:42.070 --> 04:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
hours worked uh the current currently
 
04:08:44.710 --> 04:08:44.720 align:start position:0%
employers are are reporting the 2023
 
04:08:46.830 --> 04:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
data you know that's due uh middle of
 
04:08:49.030 --> 04:08:49.040 align:start position:0%
next month although there sometimes lags
 
04:08:51.510 --> 04:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
on that so yeah this is yeah the hours
 
04:08:54.870 --> 04:08:54.880 align:start position:0%
worked for fire yes was um 669 for
 
04:08:56.910 --> 04:08:56.920 align:start position:0%
police and 488 for fire
 
04:08:59.990 --> 04:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
average you know
 
04:09:02.229 --> 04:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
yeah thank
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
you okay any other questions
 
04:09:08.349 --> 04:09:08.359 align:start position:0%
representative Dolan
 
04:09:10.309 --> 04:09:10.319 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair do do you we
 
04:09:14.349 --> 04:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
expect to be hearing from nhma for this
 
04:09:17.750 --> 04:09:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh nhma has sent a representative
 
04:09:20.309 --> 04:09:20.319 align:start position:0%
who is listening if she chooses to
 
04:09:23.109 --> 04:09:23.119 align:start position:0%
testify I'd be curious to know how what
 
04:09:25.790 --> 04:09:25.800 align:start position:0%
various municipalities feel about about
 
04:09:28.510 --> 04:09:28.520 align:start position:0%
this bill if they could tell okay we'll
 
04:09:30.830 --> 04:09:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh ask her to to report after Mr Carlin
 
04:09:30.840 --> 04:09:33.189 align:start position:0%
uh ask her to to report after Mr Carlin
is

04:09:33.189 --> 04:09:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:35.469 --> 04:09:35.479 align:start position:0%
through any other
 
04:09:55.189 --> 04:09:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:56.710 --> 04:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Maguire and members
 
04:09:58.149 --> 04:09:58.159 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
04:09:59.870 --> 04:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
is Katherine heck and I represent the
 
04:10:02.349 --> 04:10:02.359 align:start position:0%
new hampster Municipal Association I did
 
04:10:05.269 --> 04:10:05.279 align:start position:0%
not prepare testimony but we did sign in
 
04:10:07.630 --> 04:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill and I'd be Happ
 
04:10:09.149 --> 04:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
to take questions or
 
04:10:12.030 --> 04:10:12.040 align:start position:0%
explain our position you have't asked
 
04:10:14.030 --> 04:10:14.040 align:start position:0%
for an explanation thank you please
 
04:10:18.189 --> 04:10:18.199 align:start position:0%
please explain okay so I we have decided
 
04:10:20.750 --> 04:10:20.760 align:start position:0%
to oppose this bill not because we don't
 
04:10:22.990 --> 04:10:23.000 align:start position:0%
need our part-time retirees to be able
 
04:10:26.030 --> 04:10:26.040 align:start position:0%
to rejoin our Workforce in some capacity
 
04:10:28.149 --> 04:10:28.159 align:start position:0%
however based on the number of hours
 
04:10:29.590 --> 04:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
they'd be allowed to work in the
 
04:10:31.070 --> 04:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
calendar year it really becomes
 
04:10:35.830 --> 04:10:35.840 align:start position:0%
full-time work so in looking at um about
 
04:10:38.269 --> 04:10:38.279 align:start position:0%
20 to 30 of our members Personnel
 
04:10:41.309 --> 04:10:41.319 align:start position:0%
policies and what they require or Define
 
04:10:44.309 --> 04:10:44.319 align:start position:0%
as full-time is usually between 32 hours
 
04:10:47.590 --> 04:10:47.600 align:start position:0%
a week and 37 and a half some even 40
 
04:10:50.189 --> 04:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
with the average being about 35 hours a
 
04:10:52.990 --> 04:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
week so basically our local Personnel
 
04:10:55.590 --> 04:10:55.600 align:start position:0%
policies by virtue of the statute will
 
04:10:57.429 --> 04:10:57.439 align:start position:0%
become null and void as far as what they
 
04:10:59.830 --> 04:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
would be eligible for in the retirement
 
04:11:02.309 --> 04:11:02.319 align:start position:0%
system so we certainly want to preserve
 
04:11:04.830 --> 04:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to have part-time work as we
 
04:11:07.590 --> 04:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
can see from this chart we're not really
 
04:11:10.189 --> 04:11:10.199 align:start position:0%
seeing the number of retirees um taking
 
04:11:11.870 --> 04:11:11.880 align:start position:0%
full advantage of what's already on the
 
04:11:13.590 --> 04:11:13.600 align:start position:0%
books but we also want to be very
 
04:11:16.349 --> 04:11:16.359 align:start position:0%
careful to preserve the long-term
 
04:11:18.269 --> 04:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
sustainability of the retirement system
 
04:11:21.149 --> 04:11:21.159 align:start position:0%
itself and not mandate any new cost to
 
04:11:23.790 --> 04:11:23.800 align:start position:0%
employers um it would be a local option
 
04:11:26.349 --> 04:11:26.359 align:start position:0%
if someone chose to allow a retiree
 
04:11:28.990 --> 04:11:29.000 align:start position:0%
under this bill to work more hours but
 
04:11:31.149 --> 04:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
then that again would require them to be
 
04:11:34.070 --> 04:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
part of the retirement system so for for
 
04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
that reason um we think it's in conflict
 
04:11:37.910 --> 04:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
with many of our local person Personnel
 
04:11:40.710 --> 04:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
policies and contracts negotiations that
 
04:11:43.670 --> 04:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
are already in place thank you are there
 
04:11:45.790 --> 04:11:45.800 align:start position:0%
further further
 
04:11:48.950 --> 04:11:48.960 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much all right
 
04:11:51.630 --> 04:11:51.640 align:start position:0%
and the last testimony from repres from
 
04:11:59.950 --> 04:11:59.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:02.189 --> 04:12:02.199 align:start position:0%
me thank you madam chairman again
 
04:12:03.750 --> 04:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee for the record
 
04:12:05.630 --> 04:12:05.640 align:start position:0%
my name is artha bodri I represent the
 
04:12:06.710 --> 04:12:06.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire State permanent
 
04:12:08.349 --> 04:12:08.359 align:start position:0%
firefighters retirement
 
04:12:11.070 --> 04:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
Association and I am here in opposition
 
04:12:12.830 --> 04:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
of House Bill
 
04:12:12.840 --> 04:12:14.590 align:start position:0%
of House Bill
1211

04:12:14.590 --> 04:12:14.600 align:start position:0%
1211
 
04:12:17.630 --> 04:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
um a lot of the smaller departments now
 
04:12:19.269 --> 04:12:19.279 align:start position:0%
it seems like uh not even smaller
 
04:12:20.269 --> 04:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
departments some of the bigger
 
04:12:22.229 --> 04:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
departments are are trying to figure a
 
04:12:25.070 --> 04:12:25.080 align:start position:0%
way not to pay the retirement system and
 
04:12:28.469 --> 04:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
they're hiring a retired uh firefighters
 
04:12:30.389 --> 04:12:30.399 align:start position:0%
from other departments to be their
 
04:12:32.510 --> 04:12:32.520 align:start position:0%
Chiefs either a chief of police or chief
 
04:12:35.469 --> 04:12:35.479 align:start position:0%
of the fire department and allegedly
 
04:12:39.070 --> 04:12:39.080 align:start position:0%
working part-time when it's extremely
 
04:12:40.229 --> 04:12:40.239 align:start position:0%
difficult if you're a chief of a
 
04:12:42.189 --> 04:12:42.199 align:start position:0%
department to work part-time if you have
 
04:12:44.070 --> 04:12:44.080 align:start position:0%
a call in the middle of the night and
 
04:12:47.030 --> 04:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
your 30 hours or 26 hours are up you're
 
04:12:47.950 --> 04:12:47.960 align:start position:0%
not going to say well I'm not going to
 
04:12:50.109 --> 04:12:50.119 align:start position:0%
go to that fire because I had too many
 
04:12:53.670 --> 04:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
hours in and one of the hats that I used
 
04:12:55.309 --> 04:12:55.319 align:start position:0%
to wear was I was on the school board in
 
04:12:57.469 --> 04:12:57.479 align:start position:0%
the city of Manchester and I know
 
04:12:59.990 --> 04:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
firsthand that it was
 
04:13:03.469 --> 04:13:03.479 align:start position:0%
egregiously uh work now as far as uh
 
04:13:06.269 --> 04:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
principles if a principal would leave or
 
04:13:08.670 --> 04:13:08.680 align:start position:0%
if they were suspended or they were out
 
04:13:11.990 --> 04:13:12.000 align:start position:0%
for extended uh um sick leave they would
 
04:13:14.830 --> 04:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
hire uh a retired principal to come in
 
04:13:16.790 --> 04:13:16.800 align:start position:0%
and take their their position and you
 
04:13:18.590 --> 04:13:18.600 align:start position:0%
can actually do it if you look at uh
 
04:13:23.990 --> 04:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
group one uh with 1352 hours uh most
 
04:13:26.510 --> 04:13:26.520 align:start position:0%
most group one people on the education
 
04:13:29.630 --> 04:13:29.640 align:start position:0%
side is 180 days at s hours a day that's
 
04:13:32.830 --> 04:13:32.840 align:start position:0%
13113 hours so you can realistically
 
04:13:34.590 --> 04:13:34.600 align:start position:0%
retire and work a full-time job and
 
04:13:37.149 --> 04:13:37.159 align:start position:0%
still be under under the minimum hours
 
04:13:40.149 --> 04:13:40.159 align:start position:0%
of this bill we have gone on record
 
04:13:41.830 --> 04:13:41.840 align:start position:0%
every time a bill like this comes up
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
that we're opposed to it and that it
 
04:13:46.030 --> 04:13:46.040 align:start position:0%
should be back to an hourly standard
 
04:13:48.710 --> 04:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
where 20 hours a week is considered
 
04:13:51.269 --> 04:13:51.279 align:start position:0%
part-time um anything over 30 hours a
 
04:13:52.630 --> 04:13:52.640 align:start position:0%
week really are eligible for the
 
04:13:55.149 --> 04:13:55.159 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act so do you start uh
 
04:13:57.030 --> 04:13:57.040 align:start position:0%
giving uh Health Care to these
 
04:13:58.950 --> 04:13:58.960 align:start position:0%
individuals um so there's a lot of
 
04:13:58.960 --> 04:14:00.109 align:start position:0%
individuals um so there's a lot of
concerns

04:14:00.109 --> 04:14:00.119 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
04:14:03.429 --> 04:14:03.439 align:start position:0%
with raising the hours and again I'm
 
04:14:05.070 --> 04:14:05.080 align:start position:0%
repeating myself but I would like to see
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
it go back to having hours per week we
 
04:14:10.070 --> 04:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
because you can really get around the
 
04:14:12.910 --> 04:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
1352 hours when you look at a year
 
04:14:16.389 --> 04:14:16.399 align:start position:0%
especially again group one uh teachers
 
04:14:18.630 --> 04:14:18.640 align:start position:0%
with the hours that they have to work
 
04:14:21.550 --> 04:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
yeah with that I will take any
 
04:14:24.630 --> 04:14:24.640 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative Brown
 
04:14:26.309 --> 04:14:26.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair thanks for
 
04:14:28.630 --> 04:14:28.640 align:start position:0%
taking my question do do you agree with
 
04:14:30.750 --> 04:14:30.760 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor that this will help to
 
04:14:34.670 --> 04:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
bring more people to Bear to work as we
 
04:14:37.429 --> 04:14:37.439 align:start position:0%
as we hear all the time we're short uh
 
04:14:39.349 --> 04:14:39.359 align:start position:0%
everywhere in the state and and being a
 
04:14:41.550 --> 04:14:41.560 align:start position:0%
select board member in my town I know we
 
04:14:44.309 --> 04:14:44.319 align:start position:0%
struggle to fill positions the numbers
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
prove themselves the num numbers are
 
04:14:48.030 --> 04:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
showing that we're not getting we're not
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
getting enough right now under the
 
04:14:52.109 --> 04:14:52.119 align:start position:0%
existing law so I would say no what it's
 
04:14:53.630 --> 04:14:53.640 align:start position:0%
going to do is help a few people that
 
04:14:55.910 --> 04:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
want to retire and become a chief of a
 
04:14:57.790 --> 04:14:57.800 align:start position:0%
small department and not have to pay
 
04:14:59.950 --> 04:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
into the retirement system that's that
 
04:15:01.590 --> 04:15:01.600 align:start position:0%
and it hurts the retirement system
 
04:15:03.149 --> 04:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
because now you're taking money out of
 
04:15:05.349 --> 04:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
the unfunded acred liability when you're
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
not paying into the system
 
04:15:10.990 --> 04:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
so it's a double-edged
 
04:15:13.750 --> 04:15:13.760 align:start position:0%
SW thank you very much other
 
04:15:15.790 --> 04:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
questions all right that's it does
 
04:15:18.349 --> 04:15:18.359 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to testify on House
 
04:15:18.359 --> 04:15:21.030 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to testify on House
Bill

04:15:21.030 --> 04:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:24.590 --> 04:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
1299 seeing none I'll close the hearing
 
04:15:27.510 --> 04:15:27.520 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on House Bill 1421 and
 
04:15:34.630 --> 04:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:43.349 --> 04:15:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:44.469 --> 04:15:44.479 align:start position:0%
good afternoon for the record
 
04:15:46.309 --> 04:15:46.319 align:start position:0%
Representative Steve Pearson Rockingham
 
04:15:51.550 --> 04:15:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:55.070 --> 04:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
Dairy let me uh let me paint a picture
 
04:15:56.710 --> 04:15:56.720 align:start position:0%
of what's going on right
 
04:15:59.950 --> 04:15:59.960 align:start position:0%
now so right now the the Hampshire
 
04:15:59.960 --> 04:16:01.550 align:start position:0%
now so right now the the Hampshire
retirement

04:16:01.550 --> 04:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
retirement
 
04:16:04.469 --> 04:16:04.479 align:start position:0%
system has this gigantic chunk of money
 
04:16:08.269 --> 04:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
it's 11 almost 11 and a half billion
 
04:16:10.389 --> 04:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
dollars and they take that money and
 
04:16:12.070 --> 04:16:12.080 align:start position:0%
they entrust it to a
 
04:16:15.070 --> 04:16:15.080 align:start position:0%
firm whose job it
 
04:16:17.710 --> 04:16:17.720 align:start position:0%
is to follow the instructions of their
 
04:16:17.720 --> 04:16:19.030 align:start position:0%
is to follow the instructions of their
investment

04:16:19.030 --> 04:16:19.040 align:start position:0%
investment
 
04:16:23.149 --> 04:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
committee which is over an
 
04:16:23.159 --> 04:16:24.950 align:start position:0%
committee which is over an
overall

04:16:24.950 --> 04:16:24.960 align:start position:0%
overall
 
04:16:28.269 --> 04:16:28.279 align:start position:0%
Target and their job is to invest the
 
04:16:31.790 --> 04:16:31.800 align:start position:0%
money currently retirement benefits it's
 
04:16:33.870 --> 04:16:33.880 align:start position:0%
roughly 80% of retirement benefits come
 
04:16:35.910 --> 04:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
out of the employees current paychecks
 
04:16:37.429 --> 04:16:37.439 align:start position:0%
the other 20% comes through the
 
04:16:37.439 --> 04:16:42.590 align:start position:0%
the other 20% comes through the
investment

04:16:42.590 --> 04:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:44.910 --> 04:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
process as you will learn as a member of
 
04:16:47.149 --> 04:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
this committee because you will see it
 
04:16:48.469 --> 04:16:48.479 align:start position:0%
what the
 
04:16:51.070 --> 04:16:51.080 align:start position:0%
Investments returns are reports are
 
04:16:53.469 --> 04:16:53.479 align:start position:0%
filed we got a great little pamphlet
 
04:16:55.229 --> 04:16:55.239 align:start position:0%
that's published that shows it going
 
04:16:57.990 --> 04:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
back a number of
 
04:17:01.590 --> 04:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
years but what happens is that money is
 
04:17:03.469 --> 04:17:03.479 align:start position:0%
invested through one
 
04:17:07.950 --> 04:17:07.960 align:start position:0%
outfit an outfit that is paid
 
04:17:11.109 --> 04:17:11.119 align:start position:0%
a humongous amount of money to implement
 
04:17:14.149 --> 04:17:14.159 align:start position:0%
and manage the Investments That 11.5
 
04:17:14.159 --> 04:17:16.469 align:start position:0%
and manage the Investments That 11.5
billion

04:17:16.469 --> 04:17:16.479 align:start position:0%
billion
 
04:17:20.870 --> 04:17:20.880 align:start position:0%
do and to provide returns that are
 
04:17:23.149 --> 04:17:23.159 align:start position:0%
within a targeted
 
04:17:28.349 --> 04:17:28.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:34.710 --> 04:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:38.189 --> 04:17:38.199 align:start position:0%
what we could have an 18% % return we
 
04:17:41.349 --> 04:17:41.359 align:start position:0%
could have a -6% return it really does
 
04:17:41.359 --> 04:17:43.670 align:start position:0%
could have a -6% return it really does
not

04:17:43.670 --> 04:17:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:46.990 --> 04:17:47.000 align:start position:0%
matter so what has been
 
04:17:47.000 --> 04:17:50.189 align:start position:0%
matter so what has been
done

04:17:50.189 --> 04:17:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:52.269 --> 04:17:52.279 align:start position:0%
elsewhere is they've said okay wait a
 
04:17:53.590 --> 04:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
minute here since there's no incentive
 
04:17:58.070 --> 04:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
to perform perhaps we
 
04:18:00.389 --> 04:18:00.399 align:start position:0%
should put this into a situation where
 
04:18:02.710 --> 04:18:02.720 align:start position:0%
there is incentive to
 
04:18:05.109 --> 04:18:05.119 align:start position:0%
perform so what this bill does is it
 
04:18:07.269 --> 04:18:07.279 align:start position:0%
says we're going to take the the assets
 
04:18:10.070 --> 04:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
of the pension system the 115 billion
 
04:18:12.510 --> 04:18:12.520 align:start position:0%
dollars of assets and we're going to
 
04:18:15.590 --> 04:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
have two firms do it and those firms are
 
04:18:18.670 --> 04:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
going to compete against each
 
04:18:21.030 --> 04:18:21.040 align:start position:0%
other because now there is incentive to
 
04:18:24.229 --> 04:18:24.239 align:start position:0%
perform and if you fail if you are the
 
04:18:26.790 --> 04:18:26.800 align:start position:0%
lesser of the two your contract is not
 
04:18:29.349 --> 04:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
renewed and it it opens it up for
 
04:18:32.309 --> 04:18:32.319 align:start position:0%
bidding for other firms to come
 
04:18:35.469 --> 04:18:35.479 align:start position:0%
in and the firm that did perform the
 
04:18:39.309 --> 04:18:39.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:42.830 --> 04:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
renewed this is not a concept I
 
04:18:46.269 --> 04:18:46.279 align:start position:0%
invented the state of Missouri does this
 
04:18:48.030 --> 04:18:48.040 align:start position:0%
of course their assets are substantially
 
04:18:51.189 --> 04:18:51.199 align:start position:0%
larger than ours but as a as a much
 
04:18:54.630 --> 04:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
larger state but the idea is the
 
04:18:59.189 --> 04:18:59.199 align:start position:0%
same that I feel without an incentive to
 
04:19:02.229 --> 04:19:02.239 align:start position:0%
perform are we really getting the work
 
04:19:04.229 --> 04:19:04.239 align:start position:0%
we're paying for and I'll give you a
 
04:19:06.269 --> 04:19:06.279 align:start position:0%
great example when I sat on this
 
04:19:06.279 --> 04:19:09.070 align:start position:0%
great example when I sat on this
committee

04:19:09.070 --> 04:19:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:09.080 --> 04:19:11.309 align:start position:0%
 
during

04:19:11.309 --> 04:19:11.319 align:start position:0%
during
 
04:19:13.189 --> 04:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
covid the
 
04:19:16.309 --> 04:19:16.319 align:start position:0%
chairman not the chairman the the the
 
04:19:17.790 --> 04:19:17.800 align:start position:0%
representative of the investment
 
04:19:20.910 --> 04:19:20.920 align:start position:0%
committee came before this before Edna
 
04:19:23.750 --> 04:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
and I asked the simple question during
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
covid when the
 
04:19:28.149 --> 04:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
market had a downward track it didn't
 
04:19:30.790 --> 04:19:30.800 align:start position:0%
plummet but it had a downward track what
 
04:19:34.429 --> 04:19:34.439 align:start position:0%
moves did you make with the assets of
 
04:19:37.309 --> 04:19:37.319 align:start position:0%
that system to protect it while this was
 
04:19:40.630 --> 04:19:40.640 align:start position:0%
occurring the answer we received was
 
04:19:44.229 --> 04:19:44.239 align:start position:0%
nothing we did
 
04:19:48.189 --> 04:19:48.199 align:start position:0%
nothing you can watch that testimony on
 
04:19:50.189 --> 04:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
YouTube and I'm going to apologize for
 
04:19:51.830 --> 04:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
the way I responded to him ahead of time
 
04:19:56.269 --> 04:19:56.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:00.349 --> 04:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
inexcusable that a managed investment of
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
assets nearly the size of our state
 
04:20:07.070 --> 04:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
budget were pretty much non-man
 
04:20:07.080 --> 04:20:08.590 align:start position:0%
budget were pretty much non-man
they

04:20:08.590 --> 04:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
they
 
04:20:11.950 --> 04:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
spectated that cannot happen we don't
 
04:20:14.670 --> 04:20:14.680 align:start position:0%
pay for that it's not within the
 
04:20:18.550 --> 04:20:18.560 align:start position:0%
fiduciary benefit of this system and it
 
04:20:20.070 --> 04:20:20.080 align:start position:0%
certainly does not
 
04:20:23.750 --> 04:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
help getting us out of the debt that the
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
system is under so I think this concept
 
04:20:30.149 --> 04:20:30.159 align:start position:0%
would at least bring
 
04:20:34.030 --> 04:20:34.040 align:start position:0%
into this area some
 
04:20:37.830 --> 04:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
competition and would force the firms to
 
04:20:37.840 --> 04:20:39.149 align:start position:0%
competition and would force the firms to
actually

04:20:39.149 --> 04:20:39.159 align:start position:0%
actually
 
04:20:42.670 --> 04:20:42.680 align:start position:0%
manage the assets of our system for the
 
04:20:48.229 --> 04:20:48.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:51.070 --> 04:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
do I'll be happy to take questions thank
 
04:20:53.469 --> 04:20:53.479 align:start position:0%
you and I see represent of black has one
 
04:20:56.710 --> 04:20:56.720 align:start position:0%
already uh thank you um so I mean you
 
04:20:58.670 --> 04:20:58.680 align:start position:0%
looked at Missouri my question is I'm
 
04:21:01.870 --> 04:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
not um opposed to necessarily the plan
 
04:21:03.990 --> 04:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
you have but have you looked at what
 
04:21:07.149 --> 04:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
other states are doing to provide um
 
04:21:09.550 --> 04:21:09.560 align:start position:0%
some kind of incentive or competition or
 
04:21:10.990 --> 04:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
something are there other ways that this
 
04:21:12.550 --> 04:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
is handled other than what we're doing
 
04:21:15.349 --> 04:21:15.359 align:start position:0%
which is one firm and that's it I mean
 
04:21:17.950 --> 04:21:17.960 align:start position:0%
there are there are we got 50 states
 
04:21:20.950 --> 04:21:20.960 align:start position:0%
there's 50 plans I have not gone state
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
byst state to look at this um you know
 
04:21:26.790 --> 04:21:26.800 align:start position:0%
given the fact that we are a relatively
 
04:21:30.189 --> 04:21:30.199 align:start position:0%
small state and we're looking at
 
04:21:34.870 --> 04:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
a very small area of firms that would
 
04:21:37.950 --> 04:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
handle something of this magnitude
 
04:21:41.189 --> 04:21:41.199 align:start position:0%
I think two is a reasonable way to go I
 
04:21:42.670 --> 04:21:42.680 align:start position:0%
think going beyond that is going to get
 
04:21:47.229 --> 04:21:47.239 align:start position:0%
complicated and and difficult to even
 
04:21:50.790 --> 04:21:50.800 align:start position:0%
attract enough firms
 
04:21:53.510 --> 04:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
but but the that's where the the two
 
04:21:55.469 --> 04:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
basically comes from like I said the
 
04:21:57.990 --> 04:21:58.000 align:start position:0%
state of Missouri do using two follow up
 
04:21:59.910 --> 04:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
just brief I was thinking more of
 
04:22:01.469 --> 04:22:01.479 align:start position:0%
something different like uh their
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
compensation being based on return or
 
04:22:05.429 --> 04:22:05.439 align:start position:0%
something like that so performance-based
 
04:22:07.630 --> 04:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
contract is what
 
04:22:11.349 --> 04:22:11.359 align:start position:0%
I mean that's certainly a concept that
 
04:22:15.429 --> 04:22:15.439 align:start position:0%
is would be acceptable to me right
 
04:22:18.189 --> 04:22:18.199 align:start position:0%
because again we're entrusting these
 
04:22:19.389 --> 04:22:19.399 align:start position:0%
guys with
 
04:22:21.590 --> 04:22:21.600 align:start position:0%
a like I said it's almost the budget of
 
04:22:23.229 --> 04:22:23.239 align:start position:0%
the state that's a substantial amount of
 
04:22:25.990 --> 04:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
money here so okay again we're looking
 
04:22:28.870 --> 04:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
we're looking to get the best return we
 
04:22:31.149 --> 04:22:31.159 align:start position:0%
can out of these Investments without
 
04:22:34.469 --> 04:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
risking the farm right
 
04:22:36.910 --> 04:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
so I don't you know
 
04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
with the free market principle and and
 
04:22:39.479 --> 04:22:41.109 align:start position:0%
with the free market principle and and
competition

04:22:41.109 --> 04:22:41.119 align:start position:0%
competition
 
04:22:46.590 --> 04:22:46.600 align:start position:0%
being a principle of at least my party's
 
04:22:49.750 --> 04:22:49.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal conservatism I I think that th
 
04:22:52.109 --> 04:22:52.119 align:start position:0%
This falls right in line with that thank
 
04:22:54.469 --> 04:22:54.479 align:start position:0%
you I agree with that position but okay
 
04:22:54.479 --> 04:22:56.590 align:start position:0%
you I agree with that position but okay
repres

04:22:56.590 --> 04:22:56.600 align:start position:0%
repres
 
04:22:59.389 --> 04:22:59.399 align:start position:0%
Gard thank you madam
 
04:23:02.429 --> 04:23:02.439 align:start position:0%
chair so recently I was watching Tucker
 
04:23:04.630 --> 04:23:04.640 align:start position:0%
Carlson on Twitter but he interviewed
 
04:23:06.750 --> 04:23:06.760 align:start position:0%
The Wolf of Wall Street oh sure the real
 
04:23:11.229 --> 04:23:11.239 align:start position:0%
guy let's pull his name up Belfor and
 
04:23:12.710 --> 04:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
some interesting things came about that
 
04:23:14.710 --> 04:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
I think is pertinent to this sit uh
 
04:23:16.950 --> 04:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
conversation so he was discussing mutual
 
04:23:19.149 --> 04:23:19.159 align:start position:0%
funds and other fund managers hedge
 
04:23:21.229 --> 04:23:21.239 align:start position:0%
funds and so forth and the thieves they
 
04:23:22.750 --> 04:23:22.760 align:start position:0%
derive from what they do then they get
 
04:23:25.109 --> 04:23:25.119 align:start position:0%
performance bonuses and what I didn't
 
04:23:26.990 --> 04:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
realize is index traded funds so let's
 
04:23:28.910 --> 04:23:28.920 align:start position:0%
say the S&amp;P 500 the 500 strongest
 
04:23:32.109 --> 04:23:32.119 align:start position:0%
companies Etc they on year after year it
 
04:23:33.510 --> 04:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
has a 10
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
12% gain so just owning a slice of all
 
04:23:39.229 --> 04:23:39.239 align:start position:0%
those companies which as far as I
 
04:23:40.750 --> 04:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
understand doesn't really require a
 
04:23:43.670 --> 04:23:43.680 align:start position:0%
manager my point being is can we forgo
 
04:23:45.790 --> 04:23:45.800 align:start position:0%
all of this and simply have some kind of
 
04:23:47.149 --> 04:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
do you know I'm trying to get at I don't
 
04:23:48.030 --> 04:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
understand why we need these managers
 
04:23:49.750 --> 04:23:49.760 align:start position:0%
who taking all the fees off the top and
 
04:23:54.469 --> 04:23:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:57.229 --> 04:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
saying I am responsible for the lives of
 
04:23:59.750 --> 04:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
people on a fire engine I am not a
 
04:24:03.830 --> 04:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
financial adviser not even close I you
 
04:24:06.590 --> 04:24:06.600 align:start position:0%
know I I I did okay with a little bit of
 
04:24:08.830 --> 04:24:08.840 align:start position:0%
er trade work you know last year but
 
04:24:10.670 --> 04:24:10.680 align:start position:0%
certainly not to handle the assets of
 
04:24:13.349 --> 04:24:13.359 align:start position:0%
our pension system so that that's that's
 
04:24:16.429 --> 04:24:16.439 align:start position:0%
a question for that's a much deeper
 
04:24:17.710 --> 04:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
question that really would have to be
 
04:24:20.189 --> 04:24:20.199 align:start position:0%
handled by by the Retirement Systems
 
04:24:21.630 --> 04:24:21.640 align:start position:0%
board of directors and their financial
 
04:24:23.830 --> 04:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
people and that I get what you're saying
 
04:24:26.510 --> 04:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
believe me the the a market index right
 
04:24:30.630 --> 04:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
is a great thing to compare your what
 
04:24:34.109 --> 04:24:34.119 align:start position:0%
you're doing versus is you know S&amp;P 500
 
04:24:35.349 --> 04:24:35.359 align:start position:0%
being one of them and there are several
 
04:24:38.750 --> 04:24:38.760 align:start position:0%
others but the reality today and and you
 
04:24:40.229 --> 04:24:40.239 align:start position:0%
you guys will for those of you are in
 
04:24:41.710 --> 04:24:41.720 align:start position:0%
Edna for the first time when you get
 
04:24:44.590 --> 04:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
this report they break down how the
 
04:24:48.229 --> 04:24:48.239 align:start position:0%
performance in various categories okay
 
04:24:51.309 --> 04:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
one of the things that is that to me is
 
04:24:54.109 --> 04:24:54.119 align:start position:0%
kind of like it's kind of a wow moment
 
04:24:58.309 --> 04:24:58.319 align:start position:0%
is the fact that you can get I can get
 
04:25:01.790 --> 04:25:01.800 align:start position:0%
CDs in the upper sixes right now okay
 
04:25:04.229 --> 04:25:04.239 align:start position:0%
the all all we need to to for the
 
04:25:06.670 --> 04:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
retirement system to hit its minimum
 
04:25:10.429 --> 04:25:10.439 align:start position:0%
goal is 6.75 when you have a 11 billion
 
04:25:12.389 --> 04:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
dollars of assets you can actually get
 
04:25:15.030 --> 04:25:15.040 align:start position:0%
CD rates that are higher than seven
 
04:25:18.149 --> 04:25:18.159 align:start position:0%
that's zero management and zero
 
04:25:21.550 --> 04:25:21.560 align:start position:0%
risk okay so we need to kind of relook
 
04:25:23.349 --> 04:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
at this a little bit here and I think
 
04:25:25.830 --> 04:25:25.840 align:start position:0%
that getting a second set of eyes Beyond
 
04:25:28.309 --> 04:25:28.319 align:start position:0%
The Firm that we've used for the last 25
 
04:25:31.389 --> 04:25:31.399 align:start position:0%
years and get some fresh blood going on
 
04:25:33.830 --> 04:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
here maybe can can shake this thing up a
 
04:25:36.070 --> 04:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
little bit thank you I'd like to mention
 
04:25:39.670 --> 04:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned that ex officio I received the
 
04:25:42.990 --> 04:25:43.000 align:start position:0%
report from the board of the retirement
 
04:25:44.790 --> 04:25:44.800 align:start position:0%
system and I have a copy in the office
 
04:25:48.830 --> 04:25:48.840 align:start position:0%
if anybody wants to read it it's very uh
 
04:25:51.990 --> 04:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
interesting reading it's got all the
 
04:25:55.149 --> 04:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
details representative Brown uh thank
 
04:25:59.750 --> 04:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
you madam chair um so excuse me uh since
 
04:26:02.229 --> 04:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
I'm new to this whole process is there a
 
04:26:08.309 --> 04:26:08.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:10.149 --> 04:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
we have an index I don't agree with the
 
04:26:12.910 --> 04:26:12.920 align:start position:0%
number we use at 6.75 but that's that is
 
04:26:15.309 --> 04:26:15.319 align:start position:0%
The Benchmark okay that the retirement
 
04:26:18.830 --> 04:26:18.840 align:start position:0%
system uses to say this is what we need
 
04:26:21.450 --> 04:26:21.460 align:start position:0%
to run the show we base our
 
04:26:21.460 --> 04:26:23.030 align:start position:0%
to run the show we base our
[Music]

04:26:23.030 --> 04:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:26:26.710 --> 04:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
employer responsibilities based on that
 
04:26:30.670 --> 04:26:30.680 align:start position:0%
and every two years we're we reevaluate
 
04:26:33.429 --> 04:26:33.439 align:start position:0%
what we charge the municipalities a lot
 
04:26:36.389 --> 04:26:36.399 align:start position:0%
of that is based on two things one
 
04:26:37.830 --> 04:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
little tweaks and wiggles by the
 
04:26:40.189 --> 04:26:40.199 align:start position:0%
legislature but even more so by the
 
04:26:43.149 --> 04:26:43.159 align:start position:0%
investment return coming off of
 
04:26:47.790 --> 04:26:47.800 align:start position:0%
these that really drives where these
 
04:26:52.469 --> 04:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
employer rates go so
 
04:26:55.990 --> 04:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
having good investment returns with the
 
04:26:59.429 --> 04:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
system of payoff we're currently
 
04:27:02.910 --> 04:27:02.920 align:start position:0%
under will drive Municipal rates down it
 
04:27:04.830 --> 04:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
does not shorten the duration of our
 
04:27:08.229 --> 04:27:08.239 align:start position:0%
debt that's a whole another argument as
 
04:27:09.550 --> 04:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
to why we shouldn't have done it that
 
04:27:11.790 --> 04:27:11.800 align:start position:0%
way but that's how we're doing it so
 
04:27:13.830 --> 04:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
that's the driving factor for municipal
 
04:27:16.550 --> 04:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
rates the better we do in Investments
 
04:27:18.590 --> 04:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
the lower the municipal rates will be
 
04:27:21.670 --> 04:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
and I.E the cost to the taxpayer so the
 
04:27:24.830 --> 04:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
idea that this firm can pretty much go
 
04:27:27.630 --> 04:27:27.640 align:start position:0%
hey here's the rate shut up and pay me
 
04:27:28.870 --> 04:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
which is really the function that we're
 
04:27:31.349 --> 04:27:31.359 align:start position:0%
under right now to me is just not we've
 
04:27:33.070 --> 04:27:33.080 align:start position:0%
got to break from that we've got to
 
04:27:34.349 --> 04:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
break from that
 
04:27:37.349 --> 04:27:37.359 align:start position:0%
mold thank followup
 
04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:45.630 --> 04:27:45.640 align:start position:0%
better um
 
04:27:48.349 --> 04:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
uh is this a process that happens
 
04:27:49.990 --> 04:27:50.000 align:start position:0%
anywhere else in the state Contracting
 
04:27:53.070 --> 04:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
system now I know that for example there
 
04:27:56.349 --> 04:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
might be three Hazmat contractors hired
 
04:27:59.109 --> 04:27:59.119 align:start position:0%
for task because one of them isn't
 
04:28:01.950 --> 04:28:01.960 align:start position:0%
enough to handle the cases so are there
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
any other situations in the state of New
 
04:28:07.590 --> 04:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire where this competitive process
 
04:28:09.870 --> 04:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
happens the only institution in the
 
04:28:11.550 --> 04:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire that is insane
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
enough to entrust itself because of its
 
04:28:16.109 --> 04:28:16.119 align:start position:0%
size is the state
 
04:28:18.109 --> 04:28:18.119 align:start position:0%
budget it's the only thing in New
 
04:28:19.229 --> 04:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that's larger than the
 
04:28:22.349 --> 04:28:22.359 align:start position:0%
Holdings of the pension system so I
 
04:28:25.510 --> 04:28:25.520 align:start position:0%
think in this particular case we we in
 
04:28:28.590 --> 04:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
require 425 people to interject in the
 
04:28:30.830 --> 04:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
state budget I think maybe we need more
 
04:28:33.910 --> 04:28:33.920 align:start position:0%
than one firm interjecting in an 11
 
04:28:38.269 --> 04:28:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:44.229 --> 04:28:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:46.950 --> 04:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
Bailey I don't know how likely it is but
 
04:28:49.830 --> 04:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
I can imagine that the first two
 
04:28:52.790 --> 04:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
investment firms you pick are the best
 
04:28:55.830 --> 04:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
and then everybody else is the rest and
 
04:28:58.389 --> 04:28:58.399 align:start position:0%
you're comparing the two and the second
 
04:29:01.469 --> 04:29:01.479 align:start position:0%
one gets dropped out in favor of the
 
04:29:03.670 --> 04:29:03.680 align:start position:0%
rest the second one would get dropped
 
04:29:08.870 --> 04:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
out and then the the process to bid for
 
04:29:12.590 --> 04:29:12.600 align:start position:0%
that job would would begin every four
 
04:29:15.389 --> 04:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
years your someone's drop it someone's
 
04:29:19.710 --> 04:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
losing so if you're if you're actively
 
04:29:22.149 --> 04:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
managing this which is what we're paying
 
04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
a firm to do if you're actively managing
 
04:29:26.510 --> 04:29:26.520 align:start position:0%
this and you do well and you're very
 
04:29:28.990 --> 04:29:29.000 align:start position:0%
good at it you might be the one of the
 
04:29:32.750 --> 04:29:32.760 align:start position:0%
two firms for the next 50 years that's
 
04:29:37.229 --> 04:29:37.239 align:start position:0%
great but if you fail to
 
04:29:39.550 --> 04:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
to do this job that we've entrusted you
 
04:29:41.149 --> 04:29:41.159 align:start position:0%
with and you're not
 
04:29:42.910 --> 04:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
performing then we're not we're not
 
04:29:44.189 --> 04:29:44.199 align:start position:0%
interested in you anymore we're going to
 
04:29:46.109 --> 04:29:46.119 align:start position:0%
get somebody else in here that's willing
 
04:29:50.550 --> 04:29:50.560 align:start position:0%
to actually manage and care about the
 
04:29:54.870 --> 04:29:54.880 align:start position:0%
performance return and not just hold do
 
04:29:58.710 --> 04:29:58.720 align:start position:0%
what they do and get a nice sizable fee
 
04:30:02.149 --> 04:30:02.159 align:start position:0%
from the retirees mind you that pay for
 
04:30:04.349 --> 04:30:04.359 align:start position:0%
this or the active members is what I
 
04:30:06.429 --> 04:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
should say in retire is that that's
 
04:30:07.990 --> 04:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
where the money comes from to pay for
 
04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:12.239 align:start position:0%
this firm it comes out of my paycheck
 
04:30:13.790 --> 04:30:13.800 align:start position:0%
really thank you thank you
 
04:30:13.800 --> 04:30:15.750 align:start position:0%
really thank you thank you
representative

04:30:15.750 --> 04:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:30:17.990 --> 04:30:18.000 align:start position:0%
Gart something you just said caught my
 
04:30:19.750 --> 04:30:19.760 align:start position:0%
attention so what
 
04:30:22.710 --> 04:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
stops uh individual or firm that loses a
 
04:30:24.030 --> 04:30:24.040 align:start position:0%
contract from creating some shell
 
04:30:25.590 --> 04:30:25.600 align:start position:0%
Corporation somewhere and then rebidding
 
04:30:27.870 --> 04:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
isn't this just a game of shell it's a
 
04:30:31.590 --> 04:30:31.600 align:start position:0%
shell game no we have the first of all
 
04:30:32.670 --> 04:30:32.680 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office I'm
 
04:30:33.670 --> 04:30:33.680 align:start position:0%
gonna give them a little bit more credit
 
04:30:36.630 --> 04:30:36.640 align:start position:0%
than that okay these the the investment
 
04:30:39.469 --> 04:30:39.479 align:start position:0%
firms that would even begin to tackle
 
04:30:41.910 --> 04:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
something of this quantity are run
 
04:30:44.590 --> 04:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
National TV commercials they are known
 
04:30:47.030 --> 04:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
entities this is not Joe's investment
 
04:30:48.710 --> 04:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
firm that he runs out the back of his
 
04:30:50.750 --> 04:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
gas station the this you know what I'm
 
04:30:54.109 --> 04:30:54.119 align:start position:0%
saying so is Enron I mean you know I
 
04:30:56.790 --> 04:30:56.800 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry so so again we have the the
 
04:30:58.229 --> 04:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire retirement system has a board
 
04:31:01.469 --> 04:31:01.479 align:start position:0%
of directors they have an entire
 
04:31:03.870 --> 04:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
Financial advisory committee they are
 
04:31:06.229 --> 04:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
tasked with making sure
 
04:31:08.389 --> 04:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
that there's no this is not a shell game
 
04:31:10.109 --> 04:31:10.119 align:start position:0%
I mean that's that is their fiduciary
 
04:31:13.109 --> 04:31:13.119 align:start position:0%
responsibility right now okay thank you
 
04:31:15.109 --> 04:31:15.119 align:start position:0%

Carlin thanks again Mr um Madam chair uh

nhrs um board has not currently taken a
 
04:31:39.750 --> 04:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
position on this bill uh they may be
 
04:31:42.349 --> 04:31:42.359 align:start position:0%
looking at it next month um as
 
04:31:44.349 --> 04:31:44.359 align:start position:0%
representative Pierce mentioned Pearson
 
04:31:46.870 --> 04:31:46.880 align:start position:0%
rep mentioned this morning we do tend to
 
04:31:48.670 --> 04:31:48.680 align:start position:0%
talk a lot on the phone but we we
 
04:31:50.429 --> 04:31:50.439 align:start position:0%
actually haven't spoken about this bill
 
04:31:52.590 --> 04:31:52.600 align:start position:0%
and there are a couple of um
 
04:31:54.870 --> 04:31:54.880 align:start position:0%
misconceptions I I'd like to start by
 
04:31:56.750 --> 04:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
kind of clearing up with so the way the
 
04:32:01.550 --> 04:32:01.560 align:start position:0%
process works is um you know our
 
04:32:04.189 --> 04:32:04.199 align:start position:0%
our we have a Board of Trustees and they
 
04:32:06.149 --> 04:32:06.159 align:start position:0%
are casted in stat
 
04:32:08.429 --> 04:32:08.439 align:start position:0%
as fiduciaries they set an asset
 
04:32:12.149 --> 04:32:12.159 align:start position:0%
allocation hire a consultant and um get
 
04:32:13.910 --> 04:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
you know reports on from the Independent
 
04:32:16.109 --> 04:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
investment committee the in independent
 
04:32:17.870 --> 04:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
investment committee was created by
 
04:32:22.109 --> 04:32:22.119 align:start position:0%
Statute in 2009 to oversee the the ma
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
the right the management of the fund and
 
04:32:26.269 --> 04:32:26.279 align:start position:0%
the individual managers in the fund
 
04:32:29.149 --> 04:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
prior to that it was the board uh
 
04:32:31.710 --> 04:32:31.720 align:start position:0%
picking you know one one manager over
 
04:32:35.109 --> 04:32:35.119 align:start position:0%
another um type of thing so the iic has
 
04:32:38.309 --> 04:32:38.319 align:start position:0%
been around for 15 years now they are
 
04:32:40.990 --> 04:32:41.000 align:start position:0%
required by law to have experience in
 
04:32:42.830 --> 04:32:42.840 align:start position:0%

we've been able to draw um you know
 
04:32:49.550 --> 04:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
folks from you know retirees from some
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
of the larger you know puam investment
 
04:32:54.710 --> 04:32:54.720 align:start position:0%
type firms CEOs things like that uh
 
04:32:56.550 --> 04:32:56.560 align:start position:0%
private private wealth managers you know
 
04:32:58.269 --> 04:32:58.279 align:start position:0%
with their own businesses so they're
 
04:33:00.750 --> 04:33:00.760 align:start position:0%
they're the folks who are over seeing
 
04:33:03.269 --> 04:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
you know the pieces of the portfolio uh
 
04:33:05.429 --> 04:33:05.439 align:start position:0%
we have a small in-house investment
 
04:33:07.470 --> 04:33:07.480 align:start position:0%
staff as a director of Investments and
 
04:33:10.470 --> 04:33:10.480 align:start position:0%

sort of monitoring the managers we're
 
04:33:15.070 --> 04:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
not buying and selling out of nhrs and
 
04:33:17.670 --> 04:33:17.680 align:start position:0%
all of all of our uh assets are
 
04:33:20.789 --> 04:33:20.799 align:start position:0%
externally managed our staff sort of
 
04:33:23.070 --> 04:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
keeps an eye on the managers and and
 
04:33:26.390 --> 04:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
things like that and we also hire an
 
04:33:28.830 --> 04:33:28.840 align:start position:0%
investment consultant and that's that's
 
04:33:30.429 --> 04:33:30.439 align:start position:0%
what representative Pearson was talking
 
04:33:32.070 --> 04:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
about right currently it's a firm called
 
04:33:34.670 --> 04:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
Kalen Associates uh they're a national
 
04:33:36.949 --> 04:33:36.959 align:start position:0%
firm there's a you know in in like in
 
04:33:40.510 --> 04:33:40.520 align:start position:0%
any sector there's a a number of um
 
04:33:42.949 --> 04:33:42.959 align:start position:0%
investment Consultants that work with
 
04:33:45.789 --> 04:33:45.799 align:start position:0%
State County City pension plans
 
04:33:48.830 --> 04:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
endowments University yeah things like
 
04:33:52.551 --> 04:33:52.561 align:start position:0%
that um Ken is one of them we hired them
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
um after an RFP process in either 2019
 
04:33:57.750 --> 04:33:57.760 align:start position:0%
or 20 I don't have the date right in
 
04:34:00.470 --> 04:34:00.480 align:start position:0%
front of me this is a this consulting
 
04:34:02.670 --> 04:34:02.680 align:start position:0%
position is something that goes out to
 
04:34:06.949 --> 04:34:06.959 align:start position:0%
RFP um on a minimum of a fiveyear window
 
04:34:08.750 --> 04:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh we had had a consultant
 
04:34:11.310 --> 04:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
nepc again another National firm that
 
04:34:13.830 --> 04:34:13.840 align:start position:0%
had been with us um probably for 10 or
 
04:34:16.990 --> 04:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
15 years before that and in in the RFP
 
04:34:20.869 --> 04:34:20.879 align:start position:0%
process uh the last time it went through
 
04:34:23.070 --> 04:34:23.080 align:start position:0%
Ken won the hearts of the investment
 
04:34:25.150 --> 04:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
committee and the board um you know over
 
04:34:27.429 --> 04:34:27.439 align:start position:0%
the incumbent so so we do switch and and
 
04:34:29.429 --> 04:34:29.439 align:start position:0%
the consultant
 
04:34:32.029 --> 04:34:32.039 align:start position:0%
doesn't manage the money we don't just
 
04:34:33.789 --> 04:34:33.799 align:start position:0%
push it across the table and say you go
 
04:34:35.629 --> 04:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
with it the the consultant is is is what
 
04:34:38.789 --> 04:34:38.799 align:start position:0%
it sounds like it's a consultant uh they
 
04:34:42.949 --> 04:34:42.959 align:start position:0%
will assist internal staff with vetting
 
04:34:45.150 --> 04:34:45.160 align:start position:0%
uh different investment strategies and
 
04:34:47.750 --> 04:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
different investment managers uh doing
 
04:34:49.789 --> 04:34:49.799 align:start position:0%
due diligence on you know potential
 
04:34:51.949 --> 04:34:51.959 align:start position:0%
investment opportunities and give their
 
04:34:54.349 --> 04:34:54.359 align:start position:0%
provide their reports to the investment
 
04:34:57.670 --> 04:34:57.680 align:start position:0%
committee staff Also may do their own
 
04:34:59.750 --> 04:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
diligence and make a recommendation so
 
04:35:02.990 --> 04:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have one the 11 billion isn't
 
04:35:04.510 --> 04:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
like you know there's one person in a
 
04:35:06.990 --> 04:35:07.000 align:start position:0%
you know in a CL Tower smoking a cigar
 
04:35:09.629 --> 04:35:09.639 align:start position:0%
doing our money you know we we work we
 
04:35:12.789 --> 04:35:12.799 align:start position:0%
have dozens of managers under that
 
04:35:15.070 --> 04:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
umbrella we have fixed income managers
 
04:35:16.990 --> 04:35:17.000 align:start position:0%
we have private Equity managers we have
 
04:35:19.830 --> 04:35:19.840 align:start position:0%
a real estate consultant we have public
 
04:35:23.429 --> 04:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
Equity Funds managers that we invest
 
04:35:25.470 --> 04:35:25.480 align:start position:0%
with so you know and it's a diverse
 
04:35:27.590 --> 04:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
portfolio so there's the large cap
 
04:35:29.230 --> 04:35:29.240 align:start position:0%
stocks you know the you know the big
 
04:35:30.910 --> 04:35:30.920 align:start position:0%
five that are driving the market surge
 
04:35:34.590 --> 04:35:34.600 align:start position:0%
lately midsize companies small companies
 
04:35:36.551 --> 04:35:36.561 align:start position:0%
public non publicly traded companies you
 
04:35:40.109 --> 04:35:40.119 align:start position:0%
know are in the private Equity piece um
 
04:35:42.750 --> 04:35:42.760 align:start position:0%
fixed income includes bonds you know and
 
04:35:45.470 --> 04:35:45.480 align:start position:0%
other you know public and um private
 
04:35:48.429 --> 04:35:48.439 align:start position:0%
credit around the in the US and around
 
04:35:51.269 --> 04:35:51.279 align:start position:0%
the world so there's a lot of different
 
04:35:53.150 --> 04:35:53.160 align:start position:0%
consultants and you know the investment
 
04:35:56.551 --> 04:35:56.561 align:start position:0%
committee's job is to you know work you
 
04:35:58.551 --> 04:35:58.561 align:start position:0%
know they recommend an allocation to the
 
04:36:00.709 --> 04:36:00.719 align:start position:0%
board and then they then the board the
 
04:36:02.070 --> 04:36:02.080 align:start position:0%
board is comfortable with that
 
04:36:05.510 --> 04:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
allocation right now it's 50% equities
 
04:36:08.629 --> 04:36:08.639 align:start position:0%
20% fixed income 15 real estate and 15
 
04:36:12.510 --> 04:36:12.520 align:start position:0%
alts if that adds up to 100 but um you
 
04:36:15.349 --> 04:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
know they're looking for you know
 
04:36:17.709 --> 04:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
diversification in the portfolio so if
 
04:36:20.310 --> 04:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
you're all all going into growth stocks
 
04:36:21.830 --> 04:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
and it's a bare Market you you're going
 
04:36:23.869 --> 04:36:23.879 align:start position:0%
to lose your shirt so you want to have
 
04:36:25.390 --> 04:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
you know H hedge your bets not hedge
 
04:36:27.910 --> 04:36:27.920 align:start position:0%
funds we don't do those but um good
 
04:36:30.470 --> 04:36:30.480 align:start position:0%
goodness know um you know but but but
 
04:36:33.150 --> 04:36:33.160 align:start position:0%
have that diversification of a portfolio
 
04:36:35.070 --> 04:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
and and both the board and the
 
04:36:37.269 --> 04:36:37.279 align:start position:0%
investment Committee in their actions
 
04:36:39.629 --> 04:36:39.639 align:start position:0%
are fiduciaries and that that means
 
04:36:41.629 --> 04:36:41.639 align:start position:0%
under law they they have to act in the
 
04:36:44.349 --> 04:36:44.359 align:start position:0%
best interests of the plan participants
 
04:36:46.109 --> 04:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
they're basically managing this money
 
04:36:47.990 --> 04:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
for someone else you know they're
 
04:36:50.830 --> 04:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
Trustees of of this amount so they they
 
04:36:53.470 --> 04:36:53.480 align:start position:0%
have to be careful with what they uh you
 
04:36:55.029 --> 04:36:55.039 align:start position:0%
know where they choose what they choose
 
04:36:57.750 --> 04:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
to put the money in and um at least you
 
04:36:59.109 --> 04:36:59.119 align:start position:0%
know if you know not you know the
 
04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
markets are fickle and sometimes even
 
04:37:03.310 --> 04:37:03.320 align:start position:0%
the best looking Investments don't
 
04:37:04.670 --> 04:37:04.680 align:start position:0%
perform the way you want but that we
 
04:37:06.990 --> 04:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
have a process in place you know where
 
04:37:09.269 --> 04:37:09.279 align:start position:0%
steps in due diligence are taking so
 
04:37:11.349 --> 04:37:11.359 align:start position:0%
that you know the decisions meet the
 
04:37:13.070 --> 04:37:13.080 align:start position:0%
standard of what what a prudent person
 
04:37:15.150 --> 04:37:15.160 align:start position:0%
with the requisite background and
 
04:37:17.189 --> 04:37:17.199 align:start position:0%
knowledge due in that situation that's
 
04:37:18.590 --> 04:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of the fiduciary
 
04:37:22.269 --> 04:37:22.279 align:start position:0%
standard in our statute so you know
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
there there's no uh you know plug-and
 
04:37:27.470 --> 04:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
play type of thing all of the individual
 
04:37:29.869 --> 04:37:29.879 align:start position:0%
managers for instance if we if I don't I
 
04:37:31.429 --> 04:37:31.439 align:start position:0%
didn't bring the breakdown here but you
 
04:37:34.709 --> 04:37:34.719 align:start position:0%
know we have diff you know in in small
 
04:37:36.709 --> 04:37:36.719 align:start position:0%
cap stocks which are you know smaller
 
04:37:38.470 --> 04:37:38.480 align:start position:0%
publicly traded companies you know we
 
04:37:40.670 --> 04:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
probably have a couple of managers in
 
04:37:42.709 --> 04:37:42.719 align:start position:0%
that sector and they may have different
 
04:37:44.869 --> 04:37:44.879 align:start position:0%
strategies they you know they may not
 
04:37:46.830 --> 04:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
but um you know and all of these
 
04:37:49.109 --> 04:37:49.119 align:start position:0%
individual managers are under a contract
 
04:37:51.551 --> 04:37:51.561 align:start position:0%
with us and we do pay a fee um you know
 
04:37:53.310 --> 04:37:53.320 align:start position:0%
as an Institutional Investor our fees
 
04:37:55.349 --> 04:37:55.359 align:start position:0%
are less than a private investor would
 
04:37:58.510 --> 04:37:58.520 align:start position:0%
have to pay or you know 401K fee you
 
04:38:00.189 --> 04:38:00.199 align:start position:0%
know we you know there's a there's a
 
04:38:02.510 --> 04:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
standard and Poor 500 you know passive
 
04:38:04.551 --> 04:38:04.561 align:start position:0%
fund uh that we invest in and we're
 
04:38:06.551 --> 04:38:06.561 align:start position:0%
paying less than one basis point on a
 
04:38:09.750 --> 04:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
you know $3 billion piece you know so we
 
04:38:11.349 --> 04:38:11.359 align:start position:0%
have some passive Investments and we
 
04:38:13.189 --> 04:38:13.199 align:start position:0%
have some actively managed Investments
 
04:38:15.670 --> 04:38:15.680 align:start position:0%
and those have to perform better than
 
04:38:17.510 --> 04:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
the markets over a period of time or
 
04:38:19.510 --> 04:38:19.520 align:start position:0%
they're not worth you know paying for
 
04:38:21.750 --> 04:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
the additional uh people who who are
 
04:38:23.949 --> 04:38:23.959 align:start position:0%
actively managing that so these
 
04:38:27.230 --> 04:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
contracts have been on a three-year
 
04:38:30.189 --> 04:38:30.199 align:start position:0%
cycle uh you know with you know in with
 
04:38:32.310 --> 04:38:32.320 align:start position:0%
you know when they come in and you know
 
04:38:33.670 --> 04:38:33.680 align:start position:0%
why should we stick with you and you
 
04:38:36.470 --> 04:38:36.480 align:start position:0%
know the committee can opt to review
 
04:38:38.150 --> 04:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
them we have the opportunity to pull out
 
04:38:40.109 --> 04:38:40.119 align:start position:0%
at any point but you know if if we want
 
04:38:42.670 --> 04:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
to reup with them you know three some
 
04:38:44.590 --> 04:38:44.600 align:start position:0%
some we've done on a five-year basis but
 
04:38:47.310 --> 04:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
you know there there's um you know if
 
04:38:48.830 --> 04:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
there there's something you know the you
 
04:38:50.470 --> 04:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
know the Brain Trust of a particular
 
04:38:53.269 --> 04:38:53.279 align:start position:0%
fund all you know left to go somewhere
 
04:38:55.789 --> 04:38:55.799 align:start position:0%
else or walked Walked Away From The Firm
 
04:38:57.709 --> 04:38:57.719 align:start position:0%
we could pull out of that you know you
 
04:38:59.789 --> 04:38:59.799 align:start position:0%
know in a and it's not like it's you can
 
04:39:01.470 --> 04:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
pull out in a day you know there's a lot
 
04:39:03.709 --> 04:39:03.719 align:start position:0%
to untangle there and with Market timing
 
04:39:05.429 --> 04:39:05.439 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of
 
04:39:09.150 --> 04:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
uh issues where you you can't um you
 
04:39:10.789 --> 04:39:10.799 align:start position:0%
know it's going to cost you more money
 
04:39:12.629 --> 04:39:12.639 align:start position:0%
to do this on Tuesday than it is next
 
04:39:14.230 --> 04:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
Tuesday so you know we need to be
 
04:39:16.709 --> 04:39:16.719 align:start position:0%
prudent as fiduciaries in terms of the
 
04:39:18.830 --> 04:39:18.840 align:start position:0%
timing of these things so you know
 
04:39:20.551 --> 04:39:20.561 align:start position:0%
there's a lot goes on I I
 
04:39:24.150 --> 04:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
remember vaguely you know the U exchange
 
04:39:25.789 --> 04:39:25.799 align:start position:0%
representative Pearson talked about on
 
04:39:29.750 --> 04:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
YouTube and it it's not I think you know
 
04:39:31.310 --> 04:39:31.320 align:start position:0%
have not seen the clip I think I think
 
04:39:33.310 --> 04:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
the answer was we didn't do anything
 
04:39:35.310 --> 04:39:35.320 align:start position:0%
because we're long-term invest and there
 
04:39:37.830 --> 04:39:37.840 align:start position:0%
are going to be dips in markets and you
 
04:39:40.628 --> 04:39:40.638 align:start position:0%
know we it's a battleship not a you know
 
04:39:43.830 --> 04:39:43.840 align:start position:0%
a PT Boat you can't turn it on a dime um
 
04:39:45.350 --> 04:39:45.360 align:start position:0%
you know because because of the scope of
 
04:39:48.670 --> 04:39:48.680 align:start position:0%
the plan and the obligation so certainly
 
04:39:50.868 --> 04:39:50.878 align:start position:0%
the individual managers and the staff
 
04:39:50.878 --> 04:39:52.390 align:start position:0%
the individual managers and the staff
were

04:39:52.390 --> 04:39:52.400 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:39:56.350 --> 04:39:56.360 align:start position:0%
um uh following the markets during the
 
04:39:57.948 --> 04:39:57.958 align:start position:0%
pandemic and certainly those first
 
04:40:00.830 --> 04:40:00.840 align:start position:0%
couple months that really coked us
 
04:40:02.190 --> 04:40:02.200 align:start position:0%
because it was in the fourth quarter of
 
04:40:05.310 --> 04:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
the fiscal year but had we
 
04:40:07.350 --> 04:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
moved dramatically away from that
 
04:40:09.708 --> 04:40:09.718 align:start position:0%
portfolio we would have lost the 29%
 
04:40:11.868 --> 04:40:11.878 align:start position:0%
gain in the following fiscal year you
 
04:40:13.510 --> 04:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
know when when markets began to correct
 
04:40:15.030 --> 04:40:15.040 align:start position:0%
and most of that was in the second half
 
04:40:18.628 --> 04:40:18.638 align:start position:0%
of that year so you know the there's you
 
04:40:20.110 --> 04:40:20.120 align:start position:0%
know investment performance is very
 
04:40:21.910 --> 04:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
endpoint dependent you know you can look
 
04:40:23.990 --> 04:40:24.000 align:start position:0%
at any segment and you could look like a
 
04:40:26.110 --> 04:40:26.120 align:start position:0%
genius or a fool but move it over a
 
04:40:27.590 --> 04:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
couple of months and and you know it's
 
04:40:31.310 --> 04:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
more neutral uh last year um we our
 
04:40:32.270 --> 04:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
return was
 
04:40:34.350 --> 04:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
8.2% um that actually trailed our
 
04:40:36.948 --> 04:40:36.958 align:start position:0%
benchmark Mark which was uh over
 
04:40:39.470 --> 04:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
9% over the three-year period it was a
 
04:40:42.230 --> 04:40:42.240 align:start position:0%
9.6 return which exceeded the Benchmark
 
04:40:42.240 --> 04:40:43.270 align:start position:0%
9.6 return which exceeded the Benchmark
of

04:40:43.270 --> 04:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:40:47.030 --> 04:40:47.040 align:start position:0%
7.4% 5ye was 7.1 little bit over the
 
04:40:49.868 --> 04:40:49.878 align:start position:0%
Benchmark 10 year was 7.9 which was The
 
04:40:52.628 --> 04:40:52.638 align:start position:0%
Benchmark and then 25 years it was it's
 
04:40:55.708 --> 04:40:55.718 align:start position:0%
six and a half I think so you know we we
 
04:40:57.990 --> 04:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
as much as we want to have you know good
 
04:41:00.628 --> 04:41:00.638 align:start position:0%
week good month good quarter the the
 
04:41:03.190 --> 04:41:03.200 align:start position:0%
committee and doesn't invest that way
 
04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
they're investing on the Long Haul
 
04:41:09.150 --> 04:41:09.160 align:start position:0%
so so um right now Ken is the consultant
 
04:41:12.030 --> 04:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
you know they attend all of the monthly
 
04:41:14.750 --> 04:41:14.760 align:start position:0%
meetings and and provide reports and
 
04:41:17.350 --> 04:41:17.360 align:start position:0%
updates and and statistical analysis and
 
04:41:19.990 --> 04:41:20.000 align:start position:0%
things like that for us for that we pay
 
04:41:24.430 --> 04:41:24.440 align:start position:0%
them $660,000 a year in the contract so
 
04:41:27.310 --> 04:41:27.320 align:start position:0%
under this bill we'd be we would hire a
 
04:41:29.628 --> 04:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
kalon equivalent I guess you know and
 
04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
our former consultant NPC which is a
 
04:41:35.910 --> 04:41:35.920 align:start position:0%
fine firm if they were both doing this
 
04:41:38.470 --> 04:41:38.480 align:start position:0%
research and recommendation and vetting
 
04:41:40.390 --> 04:41:40.400 align:start position:0%
you know you know people don't call the
 
04:41:41.868 --> 04:41:41.878 align:start position:0%
investment director and say hey I got a
 
04:41:44.030 --> 04:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
deal for you you know you know we click
 
04:41:45.670 --> 04:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
we hang up on those and we said funnel
 
04:41:47.628 --> 04:41:47.638 align:start position:0%
them through the consultant to vet you
 
04:41:49.310 --> 04:41:49.320 align:start position:0%
know who's legitimate and what's what's
 
04:41:51.550 --> 04:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
the track record and then they'll pair
 
04:41:53.550 --> 04:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
down a list you know for the investment
 
04:41:55.868 --> 04:41:55.878 align:start position:0%
committee to interview so so there is a
 
04:41:58.830 --> 04:41:58.840 align:start position:0%
process in place so um you know so
 
04:42:01.070 --> 04:42:01.080 align:start position:0%
there's a concern on as a fiduciary of a
 
04:42:03.190 --> 04:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
redundancy with the work they're doing
 
04:42:05.750 --> 04:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
and paying somebody a similar amount to
 
04:42:08.708 --> 04:42:08.718 align:start position:0%
do essentially the same work if they
 
04:42:11.030 --> 04:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
recommend different managers is that we
 
04:42:12.628 --> 04:42:12.638 align:start position:0%
going to be making smaller Investments
 
04:42:14.670 --> 04:42:14.680 align:start position:0%
and more managers you know arguably some
 
04:42:15.910 --> 04:42:15.920 align:start position:0%
people may say that's a good thing or
 
04:42:17.868 --> 04:42:17.878 align:start position:0%
not but you know there there's an
 
04:42:21.110 --> 04:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
economy of of scale with working this
 
04:42:24.230 --> 04:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
way so and K and also we could if
 
04:42:25.708 --> 04:42:25.718 align:start position:0%
something egregious happened with them
 
04:42:27.030 --> 04:42:27.040 align:start position:0%
we could walk away but that's a
 
04:42:30.150 --> 04:42:30.160 align:start position:0%
five-year contract on their end so
 
04:42:33.190 --> 04:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
that's kind of the backlog um you know
 
04:42:34.830 --> 04:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
the highlights of you kind of want to to
 
04:42:36.708 --> 04:42:36.718 align:start position:0%
cover I'll be glad to answer any
 
04:42:39.990 --> 04:42:40.000 align:start position:0%
questions okay thank you representative
 
04:42:42.868 --> 04:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you madam chair um I actually
 
04:42:45.948 --> 04:42:45.958 align:start position:0%
have a couple questions uh you mentioned
 
04:42:49.948 --> 04:42:49.958 align:start position:0%
uh a three-year contract cycle where are
 
04:42:53.230 --> 04:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
we right now in that contract on the
 
04:42:55.030 --> 04:42:55.040 align:start position:0%
individual managers you know they they
 
04:42:56.590 --> 04:42:56.600 align:start position:0%
get hired in different months and in
 
04:42:58.270 --> 04:42:58.280 align:start position:0%
different years so there's there's you
 
04:42:59.788 --> 04:42:59.798 align:start position:0%
know there's re-ups you know you know
 
04:43:01.590 --> 04:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
one or two managers are coming up every
 
04:43:03.470 --> 04:43:03.480 align:start position:0%
C quarter you know they it's not it's
 
04:43:06.350 --> 04:43:06.360 align:start position:0%
not an all or not you know it's it's
 
04:43:10.030 --> 04:43:10.040 align:start position:0%
rolling and my next question um
 
04:43:12.708 --> 04:43:12.718 align:start position:0%
realizing that it's basically up to the
 
04:43:15.628 --> 04:43:15.638 align:start position:0%
individual investment committee to
 
04:43:17.110 --> 04:43:17.120 align:start position:0%
direct the
 
04:43:20.350 --> 04:43:20.360 align:start position:0%
Consultants as to the amount of risk
 
04:43:22.788 --> 04:43:22.798 align:start position:0%
that they want to put forward on behalf
 
04:43:27.150 --> 04:43:27.160 align:start position:0%
of the system um would it not be their
 
04:43:30.868 --> 04:43:30.878 align:start position:0%
responsibility to judge uh whatever
 
04:43:33.070 --> 04:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
firms were talking about in this bill
 
04:43:35.750 --> 04:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
rather than the actual Board of of
 
04:43:38.070 --> 04:43:38.080 align:start position:0%
Trustees yeah they they they do they
 
04:43:40.110 --> 04:43:40.120 align:start position:0%
they're they're The Gatekeepers for that
 
04:43:43.350 --> 04:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
the the that Authority was taken from
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
the full Board of Trustees invested in
 
04:43:47.910 --> 04:43:47.920 align:start position:0%
the investment committee back in 09 and
 
04:43:49.550 --> 04:43:49.560 align:start position:0%
that committee is not all board members
 
04:43:51.030 --> 04:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
it's not a subcommittee of the board
 
04:43:53.310 --> 04:43:53.320 align:start position:0%
It's actually an independent investment
 
04:43:55.590 --> 04:43:55.600 align:start position:0%
committee there are two board members
 
04:43:58.110 --> 04:43:58.120 align:start position:0%
put on by the chair and there are three
 
04:44:00.110 --> 04:44:00.120 align:start position:0%
public members and then there's an
 
04:44:02.110 --> 04:44:02.120 align:start position:0%
active member of the retirement system
 
04:44:04.430 --> 04:44:04.440 align:start position:0%
who who sits on the committee uh as a
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
non- voting member so so they meet
 
04:44:11.830 --> 04:44:11.840 align:start position:0%
um probably you know nine to 8 to 12
 
04:44:15.110 --> 04:44:15.120 align:start position:0%
times a year you know uh and and in each
 
04:44:18.150 --> 04:44:18.160 align:start position:0%
besides besides interviewing potential
 
04:44:20.470 --> 04:44:20.480 align:start position:0%
investment managers or doing contract
 
04:44:23.628 --> 04:44:23.638 align:start position:0%
re-ups they also get you know updates on
 
04:44:25.070 --> 04:44:25.080 align:start position:0%
the different segments you know so
 
04:44:26.510 --> 04:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
there's a couple time like July and
 
04:44:27.830 --> 04:44:27.840 align:start position:0%
December you know or June and December
 
04:44:29.430 --> 04:44:29.440 align:start position:0%
the real estate consultant comes in they
 
04:44:31.430 --> 04:44:31.440 align:start position:0%
go over a deeper dive into that
 
04:44:33.190 --> 04:44:33.200 align:start position:0%
portfolio fixed income you know every
 
04:44:34.830 --> 04:44:34.840 align:start position:0%
six months you know they they're
 
04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
reviewing them every month but it's a
 
04:44:38.670 --> 04:44:38.680 align:start position:0%
deeper dive and then occasionally
 
04:44:41.708 --> 04:44:41.718 align:start position:0%
because you know we're large enough you
 
04:44:43.310 --> 04:44:43.320 align:start position:0%
know not you know there's a lot bigger
 
04:44:45.190 --> 04:44:45.200 align:start position:0%
plans but you know with 11 billion you
 
04:44:47.230 --> 04:44:47.240 align:start position:0%
know we can get you know the you know
 
04:44:49.750 --> 04:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
the research director to come down from
 
04:44:51.590 --> 04:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
their their tower in New York City and
 
04:44:53.270 --> 04:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
come talk to the you know the board
 
04:44:56.150 --> 04:44:56.160 align:start position:0%
about Capital Market expectations or
 
04:44:58.110 --> 04:44:58.120 align:start position:0%
what the Ukraine war is doing to markets
 
04:44:59.708 --> 04:44:59.718 align:start position:0%
and what that's looking like so they can
 
04:45:03.550 --> 04:45:03.560 align:start position:0%
get that kind of just you know input you
 
04:45:05.270 --> 04:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
know from from experts in in different
 
04:45:07.550 --> 04:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
areas of
 
04:45:10.470 --> 04:45:10.480 align:start position:0%
finance representative leus thank you
 
04:45:11.990 --> 04:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
I'm just uh going to ask for some
 
04:45:14.190 --> 04:45:14.200 align:start position:0%
information you know for you to to get
 
04:45:18.670 --> 04:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
for the committee and that is um you
 
04:45:21.390 --> 04:45:21.400 align:start position:0%
know what what have been the returns
 
04:45:23.310 --> 04:45:23.320 align:start position:0%
each year for you know going back as far
 
04:45:25.430 --> 04:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
as you reasonably can and also list with
 
04:45:28.150 --> 04:45:28.160 align:start position:0%
that um what are the major indexes been
 
04:45:29.708 --> 04:45:29.718 align:start position:0%
for those years and then if you could
 
04:45:32.230 --> 04:45:32.240 align:start position:0%
take and group them like every five
 
04:45:34.670 --> 04:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
years averages in maybe 10 years might
 
04:45:37.430 --> 04:45:37.440 align:start position:0%
make sense but uh so we're not just uh
 
04:45:39.030 --> 04:45:39.040 align:start position:0%
freaking out because it's different for
 
04:45:42.270 --> 04:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
one year um and that information is in
 
04:45:45.270 --> 04:45:45.280 align:start position:0%
the retirement system reports and Mr
 
04:45:48.628 --> 04:45:48.638 align:start position:0%

developed following a constituent
 
04:47:19.510 --> 04:47:19.520 align:start position:0%
request the bill does two things first
 
04:47:21.470 --> 04:47:21.480 align:start position:0%
it provides a one-time supplemental
 
04:47:23.590 --> 04:47:23.600 align:start position:0%

04:47:50.430 --> 04:47:50.440 align:start position:0%
small group of disability retirees who
 
04:47:52.750 --> 04:47:52.760 align:start position:0%
sered less than 20 years and so have not
 
04:47:54.788 --> 04:47:54.798 align:start position:0%
been eligible for recent colas or

half years pretty darn close to 20 but
 
04:48:03.390 --> 04:48:03.400 align:start position:0%
there's a line in the sand working as an

Handover he trained many people and
 
04:48:12.910 --> 04:48:12.920 align:start position:0%
saved many lives Bob was injured in a
 
04:48:14.830 --> 04:48:14.840 align:start position:0%
fall on the job that broke his back in
 
04:48:18.110 --> 04:48:18.120 align:start position:0%
five places eventually after numerous
 
04:48:20.150 --> 04:48:20.160 align:start position:0%

04:48:22.350 --> 04:48:22.360 align:start position:0%
one unsuccessful attempt to return to
 
04:48:24.910 --> 04:48:24.920 align:start position:0%

04:48:27.708 --> 04:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
retirement on disability he was informed
 
04:48:29.670 --> 04:48:29.680 align:start position:0%
by his neurologist and back specialist
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
that continuing to work would result in
 
04:48:34.470 --> 04:48:34.480 align:start position:0%
even more severe pain and probable
 
04:48:35.708 --> 04:48:35.718 align:start position:0%
complete loss of

prohibits him traveling from croon to
 
04:48:51.990 --> 04:48:52.000 align:start position:0%
conquered he is tortured by the reality
 
04:48:54.670 --> 04:48:54.680 align:start position:0%
that he can no longer do things like
 
04:48:57.270 --> 04:48:57.280 align:start position:0%

$50,000 Mr Moran's retirement benefit he
 
04:49:42.150 --> 04:49:42.160 align:start position:0%

$30,000 as I'm sure you are all well
 
04:49:48.590 --> 04:49:48.600 align:start position:0%
aware that is an inade income for any

Security cost of living adjustments have
 
04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
ranged from
 
04:50:12.430 --> 04:50:12.440 align:start position:0%
1.3% to
 
04:50:15.230 --> 04:50:15.240 align:start position:0%
8.7% this bill does not attempt to match
 
04:50:18.030 --> 04:50:18.040 align:start position:0%
those just to provide a little financial
 
04:50:20.070 --> 04:50:20.080 align:start position:0%
help to our valued
 
04:50:23.190 --> 04:50:23.200 align:start position:0%

$40,000

annually as you see in the fiscal note
 
04:50:31.830 --> 04:50:31.840 align:start position:0%
the cost of this well-deserved
 
04:50:35.628 --> 04:50:35.638 align:start position:0%
compensation is $41 $1,000 as there are
 
04:50:39.270 --> 04:50:39.280 align:start position:0%
802 individuals who would be eligible
 
04:50:41.990 --> 04:50:42.000 align:start position:0%
this is a very small sum in the context
 
04:50:45.510 --> 04:50:45.520 align:start position:0%
of our banal budget and the existing
 
04:50:47.910 --> 04:50:47.920 align:start position:0%
Surplus you will hear testimony from
 
04:50:51.030 --> 04:50:51.040 align:start position:0%
Arthur bowry who is president of the New

Association and he will speak to if the
 
04:51:00.750 --> 04:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
cap is raised to $50,000 that will more
 
04:51:03.390 --> 04:51:03.400 align:start position:0%
fully recognize those in need because as
 
04:51:03.400 --> 04:51:04.270 align:start position:0%
fully recognize those in need because as
noted

04:51:04.270 --> 04:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
noted
 
04:51:06.548 --> 04:51:06.558 align:start position:0%
95% of the group two retired
 
04:51:10.110 --> 04:51:10.120 align:start position:0%
firefighters earn or are receiving less
 
04:51:11.948 --> 04:51:11.958 align:start position:0%
than $50,000 a
 
04:51:13.948 --> 04:51:13.958 align:start position:0%
year um I would appreciate the
 
04:51:15.750 --> 04:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
opportunity to amend the bill
 
04:51:17.708 --> 04:51:17.718 align:start position:0%
accordingly when it was drafted I did
 
04:51:20.230 --> 04:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
not have that U piece of
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
information so I respectfully urge the
 
04:51:25.350 --> 04:51:25.360 align:start position:0%
committee to vote OTP on this simple
 
04:51:27.590 --> 04:51:27.600 align:start position:0%
effort to slightly ease the financial
 
04:51:30.110 --> 04:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
challenges of retirees who dedicated
 
04:51:32.628 --> 04:51:32.638 align:start position:0%
many years to our well-being I thank you
 
04:51:34.470 --> 04:51:34.480 align:start position:0%
for your consideration
 
04:51:36.390 --> 04:51:36.400 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to try to answer questions
 
04:51:38.070 --> 04:51:38.080 align:start position:0%
if there are
 
04:51:40.190 --> 04:51:40.200 align:start position:0%
some are there any
 
04:51:42.548 --> 04:51:42.558 align:start position:0%
questions I don't see any thank you very
 
04:51:43.830 --> 04:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony thank you for
 
04:51:46.548 --> 04:51:46.558 align:start position:0%
your time and your work I'm sorry oops
 
04:51:48.708 --> 04:51:48.718 align:start position:0%
represent Simon does have a question
 
04:51:49.670 --> 04:51:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you for
 
04:51:52.390 --> 04:51:52.400 align:start position:0%
taking my question um course what was
 
04:51:56.070 --> 04:51:56.080 align:start position:0%
the uh why $500 in particular how did
 
04:51:57.470 --> 04:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
you arrive at that
 
04:52:00.628 --> 04:52:00.638 align:start position:0%
number no particular reason just a place
 
04:52:02.910 --> 04:52:02.920 align:start position:0%
to start okay I believe that was
 
04:52:05.548 --> 04:52:05.558 align:start position:0%
approximately the last one-time payment
 
04:52:08.390 --> 04:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
we gave to retirees okay yes that is
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:13.910 --> 04:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
chair all right thank you very much for
 
04:52:16.750 --> 04:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
your testimony Mr Carlin you've got some
 
04:52:27.350 --> 04:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:29.868 --> 04:52:29.878 align:start position:0%
us thank you madam chair again Marty
 
04:52:32.350 --> 04:52:32.360 align:start position:0%
Carlin for your retirement system the
 
04:52:33.670 --> 04:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
retirement system doesn't have a
 
04:52:37.430 --> 04:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
position on this bill I did um re
 
04:52:38.830 --> 04:52:38.840 align:start position:0%
representative Damon reached out to me
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
and we discussed this several months ago
 
04:52:43.310 --> 04:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
so I understand the constituent issue
 
04:52:47.030 --> 04:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
involved and and um just just uh again
 
04:52:48.510 --> 04:52:48.520 align:start position:0%
to kind sort of back it up a little bit
 
04:52:52.190 --> 04:52:52.200 align:start position:0%
I mean uh disability annuitants are
 
04:52:55.510 --> 04:52:55.520 align:start position:0%
eligible for one-time payments or colas
 
04:52:58.150 --> 04:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
however last year uh we end up being in
 
04:52:59.750 --> 04:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
house bill to I forget what what the
 
04:53:01.390 --> 04:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
original Bill had started in there was a
 
04:53:04.948 --> 04:53:04.958 align:start position:0%
$500 payment for retire has retired more
 
04:53:07.590 --> 04:53:07.600 align:start position:0%
than 5 years so that would be July 1 of
 
04:53:11.750 --> 04:53:11.760 align:start position:0%
18 uh or before uh making less than
 
04:53:16.390 --> 04:53:16.400 align:start position:0%
40,000 a year um they would um receive
 
04:53:19.270 --> 04:53:19.280 align:start position:0%
this and and had 20 years of service
 
04:53:21.190 --> 04:53:21.200 align:start position:0%
when they 20 years or more when they
 
04:53:25.070 --> 04:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
retired so that language adding the 20
 
04:53:28.230 --> 04:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
years to that specific one-time payment
 
04:53:31.230 --> 04:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
did pull out any you know disability
 
04:53:34.070 --> 04:53:34.080 align:start position:0%
inuent who was injured and able to
 
04:53:37.548 --> 04:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
complete more than 20 years or more um
 
04:53:39.750 --> 04:53:39.760 align:start position:0%
that that is in a regular occurrence
 
04:53:40.910 --> 04:53:40.920 align:start position:0%
there was a
 
04:53:43.948 --> 04:53:43.958 align:start position:0%
2018 $500 payment that also had a
 
04:53:45.788 --> 04:53:45.798 align:start position:0%
20-year limit on it and that that one
 
04:53:49.590 --> 04:53:49.600 align:start position:0%
actually had an even another slip up in
 
04:53:53.510 --> 04:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
it as well that we identified in um you
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
know for future reference is it it said
 
04:53:58.190 --> 04:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
me it said retirees it didn't address
 
04:54:00.628 --> 04:54:00.638 align:start position:0%
beneficiary so survivors didn't get that
 
04:54:04.548 --> 04:54:04.558 align:start position:0%
$500 and um so that you know I I
 
04:54:06.310 --> 04:54:06.320 align:start position:0%
wouldn't say it's an oversight on either
 
04:54:08.868 --> 04:54:08.878 align:start position:0%
the legislature Insurance's part where
 
04:54:11.030 --> 04:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
applying the law is written but when you
 
04:54:14.110 --> 04:54:14.120 align:start position:0%
start putting in other triggers between
 
04:54:16.110 --> 04:54:16.120 align:start position:0%
you know when you're retired or how much
 
04:54:18.230 --> 04:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
you're making people can fall through
 
04:54:19.750 --> 04:54:19.760 align:start position:0%
the cracks and that's what happened last
 
04:54:21.390 --> 04:54:21.400 align:start position:0%
year this the language in the current
 
04:54:24.590 --> 04:54:24.600 align:start position:0%
bill if it's not amended mirrors the
 
04:54:27.030 --> 04:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
qualifications for the uh last year's
 
04:54:29.990 --> 04:54:30.000 align:start position:0%
$500 payment so this cohort which I
 
04:54:32.270 --> 04:54:32.280 align:start position:0%
think we estimated is about 800 people
 
04:54:35.190 --> 04:54:35.200 align:start position:0%
who would be eligible so that's $400,000
 
04:54:35.200 --> 04:54:36.110 align:start position:0%
who would be eligible so that's $400,000
for

04:54:36.110 --> 04:54:36.120 align:start position:0%
for
 
04:54:39.350 --> 04:54:39.360 align:start position:0%
$500 um you know would get that that
 
04:54:41.948 --> 04:54:41.958 align:start position:0%
one-time payment uh after the bill
 
04:54:45.350 --> 04:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
passes uh and the the language also adds
 
04:54:47.430 --> 04:54:47.440 align:start position:0%
a provision to the statute that
 
04:54:49.948 --> 04:54:49.958 align:start position:0%
would prevent an oversight in the future
 
04:54:51.470 --> 04:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
unless the legislature otherwise
 
04:54:53.910 --> 04:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
specified that people with less than 20
 
04:54:56.270 --> 04:54:56.280 align:start position:0%
years are getting it regardless it would
 
04:54:58.948 --> 04:54:58.958 align:start position:0%
it would just carry over for those folks
 
04:55:01.190 --> 04:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
so uh that's just kind of the background
 
04:55:04.708 --> 04:55:04.718 align:start position:0%
you know back in the 80s and '90s and
 
04:55:07.430 --> 04:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
2000s you know cers were a percentage
 
04:55:09.030 --> 04:55:09.040 align:start position:0%
permanent increase to the pension and
 
04:55:11.190 --> 04:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
everybody got the same one uh in the
 
04:55:14.590 --> 04:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
member group as as um funding got tied
 
04:55:16.548 --> 04:55:16.558 align:start position:0%
and there were you know there's only one
 
04:55:19.190 --> 04:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
Cola since 2010 but these $500 payments
 
04:55:21.510 --> 04:55:21.520 align:start position:0%
have been issued periodically and in
 
04:55:23.670 --> 04:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
different years the legislature has had
 
04:55:25.830 --> 04:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
different Criterion and different
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
ceilings for how much somebody's going
 
04:55:29.830 --> 04:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
to get I can I can send over to the
 
04:55:32.510 --> 04:55:32.520 align:start position:0%
committee the sort of a 25 year history
 
04:55:34.830 --> 04:55:34.840 align:start position:0%
of the these payments just for reference
 
04:55:37.628 --> 04:55:37.638 align:start position:0%
if you if you if you want um but you
 
04:55:39.590 --> 04:55:39.600 align:start position:0%
know that's that's that's where this is
 
04:55:41.190 --> 04:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
this this is where all that all came
 
04:55:44.750 --> 04:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
from and um representative had spoken
 
04:55:46.670 --> 04:55:46.680 align:start position:0%
and Mr bodry had reached out to me
 
04:55:49.310 --> 04:55:49.320 align:start position:0%
earlier this week about if the cap for
 
04:55:52.868 --> 04:55:52.878 align:start position:0%
this group was increased to $50,000 that
 
04:55:55.350 --> 04:55:55.360 align:start position:0%
would add approximately 70 to 80 more
 
04:55:57.070 --> 04:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
people to this so that's another you
 
04:55:58.590 --> 04:55:58.600 align:start position:0%
know 35 to
 
04:56:01.548 --> 04:56:01.558 align:start position:0%
40,000 this appropriation would be a
 
04:56:03.708 --> 04:56:03.718 align:start position:0%
general fund appropriation by the state
 
04:56:05.948 --> 04:56:05.958 align:start position:0%
to to pay this benefit in this in the
 
04:56:08.510 --> 04:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
bill so glad to answer any questions
 
04:56:10.350 --> 04:56:10.360 align:start position:0%
that would how many people between 40
 
04:56:15.070 --> 04:56:15.080 align:start position:0%
and 50 uh approximately 70 to 80 and and
 
04:56:16.628 --> 04:56:16.638 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're dealing with you
 
04:56:18.350 --> 04:56:18.360 align:start position:0%
know end of fiscal year numbers from
 
04:56:20.948 --> 04:56:20.958 align:start position:0%
June may have lost some of those folks
 
04:56:22.470 --> 04:56:22.480 align:start position:0%
um you know by the time you know the
 
04:56:24.230 --> 04:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
process winds
 
04:56:27.590 --> 04:56:27.600 align:start position:0%
out thank you I didn't quite catch that
 
04:56:30.708 --> 04:56:30.718 align:start position:0%
other uh other questions representative
 
04:56:33.150 --> 04:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you madam chair uh Mr K do
 
04:56:35.548 --> 04:56:35.558 align:start position:0%
you you know uh are the disability
 
04:56:35.558 --> 04:56:36.910 align:start position:0%
you you know uh are the disability
benefits

04:56:36.910 --> 04:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
benefits
 
04:56:40.110 --> 04:56:40.120 align:start position:0%
taxable um The Accidental which is a job
 
04:56:42.190 --> 04:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
related disability those are non-
 
04:56:45.230 --> 04:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
taxable and um you know the the uh
 
04:56:47.868 --> 04:56:47.878 align:start position:0%
ordinary or non-job related uh benefits
 
04:56:50.670 --> 04:56:50.680 align:start position:0%
are taxable I I honestly don't know what
 
04:56:52.948 --> 04:56:52.958 align:start position:0%
the five how the $500 would apply for
 
04:56:54.270 --> 04:56:54.280 align:start position:0%
taxation because it's not part of the
 
04:56:55.868 --> 04:56:55.878 align:start position:0%
pension it's a one-time payment so I'm
 
04:56:57.788 --> 04:56:57.798 align:start position:0%
thinking that would be taxable could
 
04:57:01.670 --> 04:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:06.670 --> 04:57:06.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:10.548 --> 04:57:10.558 align:start position:0%
questions I had one I heard a report I'm
 
04:57:13.230 --> 04:57:13.240 align:start position:0%
not sure where that half the group two
 
04:57:16.270 --> 04:57:16.280 align:start position:0%
retirees were on disability pensions is
 
04:57:17.910 --> 04:57:17.920 align:start position:0%
that correct or was I totally
 
04:57:20.830 --> 04:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
misinformed that that that is incorrect
 
04:57:23.590 --> 04:57:23.600 align:start position:0%
um I uh the other representative Maguire
 
04:57:26.190 --> 04:57:26.200 align:start position:0%
asked me the same question this morning
 
04:57:30.110 --> 04:57:30.120 align:start position:0%
ah and I I I scroll down some notes from
 
04:57:32.070 --> 04:57:32.080 align:start position:0%
the our annual report that I wrote on my
 
04:57:36.628 --> 04:57:36.638 align:start position:0%
phone um um and it it looks like of uh
 
04:57:38.868 --> 04:57:38.878 align:start position:0%
for group two there's
 
04:57:41.350 --> 04:57:41.360 align:start position:0%
4764 total police
 
04:57:44.110 --> 04:57:44.120 align:start position:0%
retirees and both job related and
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
non-job related there
 
04:57:49.548 --> 04:57:49.558 align:start position:0%
4177 disability notes so less than 10%
 
04:57:51.510 --> 04:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh I was totally misinformed yeah and
 
04:57:54.788 --> 04:57:54.798 align:start position:0%
much less 132 out of 1900 for fire so
 
04:57:57.628 --> 04:57:57.638 align:start position:0%
even lower percentage I'm so glad to
 
04:58:00.510 --> 04:58:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:03.750 --> 04:58:03.760 align:start position:0%
it all right does anyone else have any
 
04:58:07.430 --> 04:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:10.310 --> 04:58:10.320 align:start position:0%
or all right thank you um thank you for
 
04:58:19.948 --> 04:58:19.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:22.230 --> 04:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
bodri thank you madam chairman members
 
04:58:23.750 --> 04:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
04:58:25.868 --> 04:58:25.878 align:start position:0%
is ala bodri I represent the New
 
04:58:27.830 --> 04:58:27.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire State permanent fire fighter
 
04:58:30.230 --> 04:58:30.240 align:start position:0%
retirement Association and I'm here to
 
04:58:33.948 --> 04:58:33.958 align:start position:0%
speak in favor of House Bill 1307 and uh
 
04:58:35.948 --> 04:58:35.958 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify um the
 
04:58:37.470 --> 04:58:37.480 align:start position:0%
representative mentioned professional
 
04:58:39.350 --> 04:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
firefighters I represent the permanent
 
04:58:42.868 --> 04:58:42.878 align:start position:0%
firefighters um and uh we are here in
 
04:58:45.470 --> 04:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
favor of it and again the these are
 
04:58:48.830 --> 04:58:48.840 align:start position:0%
members who didn't choose to retire um
 
04:58:51.350 --> 04:58:51.360 align:start position:0%
or to get injured for that matter they
 
04:58:53.910 --> 04:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
they had to retire due to a job related
 
04:58:56.590 --> 04:58:56.600 align:start position:0%
injury and most of these injuries that
 
04:58:58.868 --> 04:58:58.878 align:start position:0%
at least firefighters you know if they
 
04:59:00.830 --> 04:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
they like um the representative
 
04:59:03.548 --> 04:59:03.558 align:start position:0%
mentioned you know you hurt your back
 
04:59:06.590 --> 04:59:06.600 align:start position:0%
if you if you're gaining income because
 
04:59:10.510 --> 04:59:10.520 align:start position:0%
of Physical Agility or ability and then
 
04:59:13.110 --> 04:59:13.120 align:start position:0%
you lose that your income is definitely
 
04:59:15.948 --> 04:59:15.958 align:start position:0%
diminished and I I can't reiterate
 
04:59:18.150 --> 04:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
enough that group two does not receive
 
04:59:20.750 --> 04:59:20.760 align:start position:0%
Social Security and that's a huge thing
 
04:59:22.548 --> 04:59:22.558 align:start position:0%
so these people that are going out on
 
04:59:24.868 --> 04:59:24.878 align:start position:0%
disability they may not be able to
 
04:59:27.670 --> 04:59:27.680 align:start position:0%
obtain another job but also they don't
 
04:59:30.548 --> 04:59:30.558 align:start position:0%
have so security to fall back on either
 
04:59:33.150 --> 04:59:33.160 align:start position:0%
um so over the last decade uh the cost
 
04:59:35.990 --> 04:59:36.000 align:start position:0%
of living based on a CPI has gone up
 
04:59:39.948 --> 04:59:39.958 align:start position:0%
approximately 20 29.3 3% while col is
 
04:59:41.548 --> 04:59:41.558 align:start position:0%
granted to group two police and
 
04:59:43.788 --> 04:59:43.798 align:start position:0%
firefighters over the same time period
 
04:59:46.628 --> 04:59:46.638 align:start position:0%
were 1 and a half% over the last 20
 
04:59:50.390 --> 04:59:50.400 align:start position:0%
years cost of living has gone up by 64.5
 
04:59:53.190 --> 04:59:53.200 align:start position:0%
3% while col is granted to group two
 
04:59:54.868 --> 04:59:54.878 align:start position:0%
police and fire over the same time
 
04:59:56.350 --> 04:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
period were
 
04:59:59.390 --> 04:59:59.400 align:start position:0%
12.25% and 15%
 
05:00:03.110 --> 05:00:03.120 align:start position:0%
respectfully um that is over uh TW that
 
05:00:03.120 --> 05:00:03.990 align:start position:0%
respectfully um that is over uh TW that
over

05:00:03.990 --> 05:00:04.000 align:start position:0%
over
 
05:00:06.708 --> 05:00:06.718 align:start position:0%
52% uh of the pensioners buying power
 
05:00:08.990 --> 05:00:09.000 align:start position:0%
has been eliminated due to inflation and
 
05:00:11.548 --> 05:00:11.558 align:start position:0%
the lack of adequate cers the permanent
 
05:00:14.310 --> 05:00:14.320 align:start position:0%
firefighters had legislation submitted
 
05:00:16.670 --> 05:00:16.680 align:start position:0%
uh had legislation submitted for a cola
 
05:00:18.948 --> 05:00:18.958 align:start position:0%
last year and again the bill was changed
 
05:00:21.110 --> 05:00:21.120 align:start position:0%
in the Senate finance committee instead
 
05:00:23.910 --> 05:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
of a cola a stien was granted for those
 
05:00:25.788 --> 05:00:25.798 align:start position:0%
members making less than
 
05:00:28.868 --> 05:00:28.878 align:start position:0%
$40,000 and it included group one that
 
05:00:32.190 --> 05:00:32.200 align:start position:0%
change partic uh practically eliminated
 
05:00:34.948 --> 05:00:34.958 align:start position:0%
a large group group of group two members
 
05:00:36.510 --> 05:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
as I stated before group two
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
firefighters average pension is
 
05:00:38.400 --> 05:00:40.150 align:start position:0%
firefighters average pension is
approximately

05:00:40.150 --> 05:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
05:00:43.070 --> 05:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
$45,000 social security has uh given its
 
05:00:46.470 --> 05:00:46.480 align:start position:0%
members an 8.7% increase in
 
05:00:51.070 --> 05:00:51.080 align:start position:0%
2023 and went uh up again this year at
 
05:00:54.070 --> 05:00:54.080 align:start position:0%
3.2% unfortunately group two police and
 
05:00:56.948 --> 05:00:56.958 align:start position:0%
fire don't receive Social Security um
 
05:00:58.788 --> 05:00:58.798 align:start position:0%
the average pension for a group two
 
05:01:00.750 --> 05:01:00.760 align:start position:0%
police officer is approximately
 
05:01:03.430 --> 05:01:03.440 align:start position:0%
$40,000 and the average for
 
05:01:05.548 --> 05:01:05.558 align:start position:0%
uh firefighter is approximately
 
05:01:08.230 --> 05:01:08.240 align:start position:0%
$45,000 so if you were to raise or
 
05:01:12.150 --> 05:01:12.160 align:start position:0%
change amend the bill to go to 50,000 as
 
05:01:14.510 --> 05:01:14.520 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Collins stated it bring in another
 
05:01:18.190 --> 05:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
70 to 80 members and uh 95% of the
 
05:01:21.310 --> 05:01:21.320 align:start position:0%
members make less than $50,000 a year
 
05:01:22.830 --> 05:01:22.840 align:start position:0%
and that is not a lot of money to live
 
05:01:26.548 --> 05:01:26.558 align:start position:0%
on um you know taxes are going up uh
 
05:01:28.948 --> 05:01:28.958 align:start position:0%

questions representa Simon and then
 
05:01:47.470 --> 05:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
representative man thank you madam chair
 
05:01:50.190 --> 05:01:50.200 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um just
 
05:01:52.470 --> 05:01:52.480 align:start position:0%
for clarification purposes the average
 
05:01:54.910 --> 05:01:54.920 align:start position:0%
pension has been mentioned several times
 
05:01:56.830 --> 05:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking average pension
 
05:01:58.708 --> 05:01:58.718 align:start position:0%
are we talking across to all pensioners
 
05:02:02.310 --> 05:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
meaning all number all years of service
 
05:02:05.390 --> 05:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
all you know um are we talking about you
 
05:02:07.070 --> 05:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
know some people were 10 years some
 
05:02:08.590 --> 05:02:08.600 align:start position:0%
people 20 years some people with 30
 
05:02:10.590 --> 05:02:10.600 align:start position:0%
years experience because it will
 
05:02:12.670 --> 05:02:12.680 align:start position:0%
obviously greatly affect the average
 
05:02:14.270 --> 05:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
that's right the average from my
 
05:02:15.670 --> 05:02:15.680 align:start position:0%
understanding and Marty correct me if
 
05:02:17.510 --> 05:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong if there's a thousand retired
 
05:02:19.750 --> 05:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
firefighters the average is going to be
 
05:02:22.430 --> 05:02:22.440 align:start position:0%
$45,000 for that thousand firefighter
 
05:02:24.310 --> 05:02:24.320 align:start position:0%
regardless of number of years served or
 
05:02:26.590 --> 05:02:26.600 align:start position:0%
anything like that okay thank you
 
05:02:29.750 --> 05:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah person Man Booty thank you madam
 
05:02:32.830 --> 05:02:32.840 align:start position:0%
chair just to clar another clarification
 
05:02:34.910 --> 05:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
the 70 to 80
 
05:02:39.310 --> 05:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
people after the ceiling of 40 to 50,000
 
05:02:41.350 --> 05:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
has increased right yes so the total
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
number of uh
 
05:02:47.390 --> 05:02:47.400 align:start position:0%
retirees or um retirees with the
 
05:02:50.590 --> 05:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
disability yes that we are looking at is
 
05:02:53.470 --> 05:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
total number is 70 to 80 people the
 
05:02:55.390 --> 05:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
total number would be 800 because the
 
05:02:58.230 --> 05:02:58.240 align:start position:0%
original number brought in 800 and I
 
05:02:59.430 --> 05:02:59.440 align:start position:0%
think it was
 
05:03:03.070 --> 05:03:03.080 align:start position:0%
8002 82 Sophia let's go with the high in
 
05:03:06.628 --> 05:03:06.638 align:start position:0%
if you add another 80 it'll be 882 okay
 
05:03:09.868 --> 05:03:09.878 align:start position:0%
for a total okay other questions
 
05:03:09.878 --> 05:03:11.030 align:start position:0%
for a total okay other questions
