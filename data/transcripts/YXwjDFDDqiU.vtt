recommended budget it's on page 939 is
 
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 align:start position:0%

thank you for the opportunity to walk
 
00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
through our Public Health budget in
 
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
order for any State Health Department to
 
00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 align:start position:0%
support and protect the communities we
 
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 align:start position:0%
serve we need sufficient resources to
 
00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 align:start position:0%
respond to both state and local priority
 
00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 align:start position:0%
about a few challenges that we face then
 
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to dive into the many many
 
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 align:start position:0%
accounting units that are in public
 
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
health I have about 40 something slides
 
00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:25.979 align:start position:0%
and a 90 page budget briefing book it's
 
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
um it for the most part it will be just
 
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 align:start position:0%
Nathan and I at the table today but we
 
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 align:start position:0%
have our deputy director Ian watt who's
 
00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
sitting in the back and our Public
 
00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 align:start position:0%
Health finance manager Shelly Swanson in
 
00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 align:start position:0%
case you stump us with a question that
 
00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 align:start position:0%
we can't answer they can back us up they
 
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
can phone a friend we will be able to
 
00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
get the information that you need so my
 
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:49.860 align:start position:0%
goal for the next few hours is to go
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
through the budgets give you a high
 
00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
level overview with the opportunity to
 
00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
pause dig deep in any areas of interest
 
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 align:start position:0%
that you might have so um we have a
 
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 align:start position:0%
slide deck here if we flip to slide two
 
00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:07.020 align:start position:0%
our mission and vision on this slide
 
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:09.720 align:start position:0%
represents the ways in both large and
 
00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:12.660 align:start position:0%
small that our work how our work is
 
00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
designed to prevent the spread of
 
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
disease and help people stay healthy
 
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 align:start position:0%
that's sort of all of it in a nutshell
 
00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:20.699 align:start position:0%
and we do that in partnership with
 
00:06:23.629 --> 00:06:23.639 align:start position:0%
policy makers and communities and our
 
00:06:26.749 --> 00:06:26.759 align:start position:0%
core functions are not new as the
 
00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:28.740 align:start position:0%
archives that sit outside my office
 
00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
indicate we've been doing a lot of it as
 
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
a function of state government for well
 
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580 align:start position:0%
over a hundred years years counting
 
00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380 align:start position:0%
things keeping track of Health Data
 
00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:39.780 align:start position:0%
inspecting milk food make sure it was
 
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
healthy using our laboratory to diagnose
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
disease and contain outbreaks and
 
00:06:47.689 --> 00:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
ensuring that there are safety nets for
 
00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 align:start position:0%
pregnant women and infants and that we
 
00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:52.380 align:start position:0%
address environmental hazards that
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
impact Health more recently Public
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
Health has been on the front page of the
 
00:06:58.189 --> 00:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
newspaper for the past three years
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
throughout the pandemic many of you may
 
00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:03.300 align:start position:0%
have gotten sick of us along the way but
 
00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
I hope that we have time to talk about
 
00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 align:start position:0%
the million other ways other than covid
 
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:10.620 align:start position:0%
that we use state and federal resources
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
to put this Mission and these values
 
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:16.620 align:start position:0%
into practice and in fact today is my
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
day of props I have with me as sort of
 
00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:21.419 align:start position:0%
my backup this book right here is from
 
00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:24.180 align:start position:0%
1882 it is the first published Public
 
00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:26.819 align:start position:0%
Health Report that sits outside my desk
 
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
I have about a hundred of these that sit
 
00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:31.500 align:start position:0%
out there that are really fascinating so
 
00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:33.240 align:start position:0%
um it's like there's my little backup
 
00:07:37.189 --> 00:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
here to keep to keep me grounded so on
 
00:07:39.290 --> 00:07:39.300 align:start position:0%
slide three at the broadest level you're
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%
going to see the 10 essential services
 
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
that provide a framework for all that we
 
00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:46.080 align:start position:0%
do from assessing and monitoring
 
00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
population health status to
 
00:07:49.790 --> 00:07:49.800 align:start position:0%
investigating diagnosing addressing
 
00:07:52.730 --> 00:07:52.740 align:start position:0%
health concerns and problems to
 
00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:54.960 align:start position:0%
improving our work through ongoing
 
00:07:58.249 --> 00:07:58.259 align:start position:0%
research and and quality improvement on
 
00:08:00.650 --> 00:08:00.660 align:start position:0%
slide four we put a little bit of a
 
00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
finer point on it this gives a couple of
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
additional examples of what we do and
 
00:08:08.450 --> 00:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
how it fits into those 10 essential
 
00:08:11.749 --> 00:08:11.759 align:start position:0%
services and responsibilities if we
 
00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:14.220 align:start position:0%
start with protection this includes our
 
00:08:17.570 --> 00:08:17.580 align:start position:0%
incredibly capable emergency response
 
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
functions all the way and then sort of
 
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
spreads all the way to things like food
 
00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
safety inspections not only of
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
restaurants but things like dairy farms
 
00:08:27.529 --> 00:08:27.539 align:start position:0%
and and milk distribution
 
00:08:30.830 --> 00:08:30.840 align:start position:0%
we look to Scientific evidence to inform
 
00:08:33.829 --> 00:08:33.839 align:start position:0%
our strategies this is where in places
 
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:36.659 align:start position:0%
like chronic disease prevention excels
 
00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:38.880 align:start position:0%
we know how to do things like diabetes
 
00:08:40.969 --> 00:08:40.979 align:start position:0%
self-management and we know that there
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
are effective supports to help people
 
00:08:45.889 --> 00:08:45.899 align:start position:0%
stop smoking not only to improve
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
people's lives but also to save the
 
00:08:50.810 --> 00:08:50.820 align:start position:0%
state money in places like Medicaid and
 
00:08:53.329 --> 00:08:53.339 align:start position:0%
long-term care supports prevention is
 
00:08:55.190 --> 00:08:55.200 align:start position:0%
really at the heart of almost everything
 
00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
that we do whether that's to ensure that
 
00:09:00.350 --> 00:09:00.360 align:start position:0%
we have strong primary care and public
 
00:09:02.509 --> 00:09:02.519 align:start position:0%
health infrastructure or ensuring that
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
all kids and all families have access to
 
00:09:07.790 --> 00:09:07.800 align:start position:0%
Childhood vaccines you're going to hear
 
00:09:09.530 --> 00:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
a lot about data as we go through our
 
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
budgets and our programs the numbers are
 
00:09:14.690 --> 00:09:14.700 align:start position:0%
behind everything that we do and I hope
 
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
you've spent some time on the DHHS data
 
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:19.260 align:start position:0%
portal I've talked about it a lot at
 
00:09:21.829 --> 00:09:21.839 align:start position:0%
other times we've met or that you've had
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
an opportunity to read important reports
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
that we've put out for example this year
 
00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:27.959 align:start position:0%
we have a report around our our
 
00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:30.300 align:start position:0%
investigation of excess rates of kidney
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
cancer in Merrimack very important work
 
00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
that we do in partnership with our
 
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
friends at the Department of
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services as well as
 
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:40.380 align:start position:0%
through multiple areas within the
 
00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
division of Public Health and finally
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
again it's all about improving Health
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
outcomes whether it is preventing
 
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:49.800 align:start position:0%
adverse childhood experiences or using
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
quality improvement methods to make sure
 
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
our preventative screening programs are
 
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:57.240 align:start position:0%
timely and that they actually improve
 
00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
outcomes so if you slide to slide five
 
00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:02.700 align:start position:0%
this is where you know this is sort of
 
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:04.740 align:start position:0%
the ultimate this is when we talk about
 
00:10:06.889 --> 00:10:06.899 align:start position:0%
health outcomes and data everything
 
00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:10.980 align:start position:0%
rolls up to morbidity and mortality we
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity to look at the slide
 
00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:16.019 align:start position:0%
when I came earlier for our pre-hearing
 
00:10:19.009 --> 00:10:19.019 align:start position:0%
this one has the added 2022 data it is
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
preliminary it's got a little asterisk
 
00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:22.500 align:start position:0%
because death data takes a little bit
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
while to become complete but it's pretty
 
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:27.180 align:start position:0%
close is you know my scientific way of
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
saying that can we take a pause or for a
 
00:10:31.370 --> 00:10:31.380 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman would you like to
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
take questions now or at the end first
 
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:37.560 align:start position:0%
slide on the first leg right ahead okay
 
00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
so on slide four right you mentioned
 
00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:42.120 align:start position:0%
vaccines for children yes
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
and I noticed that
 
00:10:46.970 --> 00:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
um on Facebook there's still ads running
 
00:10:49.970 --> 00:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
for coveted vaccines for children
 
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:51.240 align:start position:0%
um is that something you guys are still
 
00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:52.430 align:start position:0%
um is that something you guys are still
pushing

00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:52.440 align:start position:0%
pushing
 
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:53.700 align:start position:0%
um I
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
the word that I would use to
 
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:56.220 align:start position:0%
characterize it we want to make sure
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
that it is available to anyone who wants
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
it okay sorry advertising there may be a
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
little bit of political bias in the term
 
00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.050 align:start position:0%
little bit of political bias in the term
pushing

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:03.060 align:start position:0%
pushing
 
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:03.650 align:start position:0%
pushing
um

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:03.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:06.410 --> 00:11:06.420 align:start position:0%
there seems to be compelling evidence in
 
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
in the case of children right under
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
under those under the age of 18 that the
 
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:15.120 align:start position:0%
adverse effects are significant and the
 
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:18.480 align:start position:0%
relative risk of covid is is very very
 
00:11:21.650 --> 00:11:21.660 align:start position:0%
low based on the data that's on the on
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
the dashboard
 
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
would we better be better spent using
 
00:11:28.069 --> 00:11:28.079 align:start position:0%
that money elsewhere so I think
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
primarily if you've seen some of our
 
00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:31.800 align:start position:0%
sponsored links on Facebook they're
 
00:11:33.949 --> 00:11:33.959 align:start position:0%
really mostly focused at individuals 50
 
00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
and up that is the target group that we
 
00:11:38.269 --> 00:11:38.279 align:start position:0%
are advertising to right now because
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
those are as you know the folks that
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
have the highest risk of morbidity we
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
have lost children we have lost young
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
adults in this state there have been
 
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:48.480 align:start position:0%
deaths that are covid related among
 
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:50.700 align:start position:0%
young children nowhere near the scale of
 
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:52.380 align:start position:0%
those that are older
 
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:53.880 align:start position:0%
um we just want to make sure that
 
00:11:55.910 --> 00:11:55.920 align:start position:0%
coveted vaccines are available to those
 
00:11:58.009 --> 00:11:58.019 align:start position:0%
people that want them
 
00:12:00.889 --> 00:12:00.899 align:start position:0%
and so drilling down a little further
 
00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:03.660 align:start position:0%
um we do know that Healthy Lifestyles
 
00:12:06.230 --> 00:12:06.240 align:start position:0%
right proper nutrition are things that
 
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:09.240 align:start position:0%
are the best defense against some of
 
00:12:11.329 --> 00:12:11.339 align:start position:0%
these particular diseases
 
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
does it not make more sense to spend
 
00:12:15.590 --> 00:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
that same dollars promoting things like
 
00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:17.420 align:start position:0%
reducing obesity
 
00:12:20.090 --> 00:12:20.100 align:start position:0%
eating healthy cutting out sugar getting
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
exercise sunlight Vitamin D the list
 
00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:25.560 align:start position:0%
goes on sure you know I think as we go
 
00:12:26.870 --> 00:12:26.880 align:start position:0%
through this budget look you'll see that
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
we spend lots of resources and quite
 
00:12:31.009 --> 00:12:31.019 align:start position:0%
frankly could spend even more if those
 
00:12:32.990 --> 00:12:33.000 align:start position:0%
resources were made available to us in
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
doing those preventative activities so
 
00:12:36.530 --> 00:12:36.540 align:start position:0%
you know things like our chronic disease
 
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
programs are really focused not only on
 
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
adult things like diabetes
 
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
self-management sort of which is when
 
00:12:44.629 --> 00:12:44.639 align:start position:0%
the horse is out of the barn I think is
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
the the phrase but also on ensuring that
 
00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
kids have access to a water bottle
 
00:12:49.380 --> 00:12:55.670 align:start position:0%
kids have access to a water bottle
filler

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
sorry thank you I'm pretty loud so I I
 
00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:00.839 align:start position:0%
also just want to add some context I I
 
00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:03.660 align:start position:0%
think the marketing uh that you saw on
 
00:13:06.590 --> 00:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
Facebook my understanding is that's
 
00:13:09.170 --> 00:13:09.180 align:start position:0%
probably paid for the federal money that
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
came through the fiscal committee and
 
00:13:13.490 --> 00:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal committee green lit the
 
00:13:15.710 --> 00:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
program on the understanding that this
 
00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:17.660 align:start position:0%
was making it available and not
 
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
recommending that healthy kids get the
 
00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:23.459 align:start position:0%
covid injection that is correct thank
 
00:13:24.949 --> 00:13:24.959 align:start position:0%
you representative Edwards that is
 
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
correct and quite frankly the majority
 
00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
of again some of those sponsored posts
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
if you look at them are really aimed at
 
00:13:33.410 --> 00:13:33.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.670 --> 00:13:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
so we can go to slide five which is
 
00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:39.120 align:start position:0%
um you know sort of at the core of what
 
00:13:41.269 --> 00:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
we do which is the things you die of in
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
um and everywhere else the added as I
 
00:13:47.269 --> 00:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
noted we added preliminary 2022 data
 
00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:49.500 align:start position:0%
when we last met I talked about the fact
 
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
that kovid has actually probably slipped
 
00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:52.670 align:start position:0%
that kovid has actually probably slipped
down

00:13:52.670 --> 00:13:52.680 align:start position:0%
down
 
00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:55.740 align:start position:0%
um over the past few years in 2020 it
 
00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
was the fourth leading cause of death in
 
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
the state in 2021 it was the third
 
00:14:04.129 --> 00:14:04.139 align:start position:0%
leading cause of death in the state and
 
00:14:06.769 --> 00:14:06.779 align:start position:0%
by 2022 it looks like it's going to slip
 
00:14:08.509 --> 00:14:08.519 align:start position:0%
down to about the fifth leading cause of
 
00:14:10.370 --> 00:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
death which actually is lower than
 
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
probably the rest of the country again
 
00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:13.980 align:start position:0%
all the states haven't landed on those
 
00:14:15.949 --> 00:14:15.959 align:start position:0%
final numbers because death data takes a
 
00:14:19.610 --> 00:14:19.620 align:start position:0%
little bit longer what what I will
 
00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:21.650 align:start position:0%
little bit longer what what I will
representative

00:14:21.650 --> 00:14:21.660 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:14:25.129 --> 00:14:25.139 align:start position:0%
thank you do you have a graph that shows
 
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
comparison of all-cause mortality over
 
00:14:29.329 --> 00:14:29.339 align:start position:0%
the past few years
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
are you are this is the list of all of
 
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:35.100 align:start position:0%
all New Hampshire residents cause of
 
00:14:37.550 --> 00:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
death 20. right but what I'm looking for
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
is so something that shows for each year
 
00:14:43.730 --> 00:14:43.740 align:start position:0%
all the deaths one number and then that
 
00:14:46.009 --> 00:14:46.019 align:start position:0%
number over like the last five years we
 
00:14:47.210 --> 00:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
could put that together if you wanted
 
00:14:50.569 --> 00:14:50.579 align:start position:0%
that'd be great thank you thank you
 
00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:52.680 align:start position:0%
um and I I have to ask about the
 
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
covid-19 number sure
 
00:14:58.210 --> 00:14:58.220 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of discussion about
 
00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
the difference between dying because of
 
00:15:05.449 --> 00:15:05.459 align:start position:0%
covid and dying with covid correct it's
 
00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
my understanding that by and large the
 
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:10.940 align:start position:0%
reported data is people who have died
 
00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:15.300 align:start position:0%
with covid not because of covet is is
 
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:18.120 align:start position:0%
that is that accurate I I would not
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
suggest that that is completely accurate
 
00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:21.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has taken a very
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
conservative approach to identifying
 
00:15:25.550 --> 00:15:25.560 align:start position:0%
coveted deaths over time
 
00:15:27.530 --> 00:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
um we review every single death
 
00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:30.000 align:start position:0%
certificate and ensure that
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
um it makes sense
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
um that the uh that Co the way in which
 
00:15:37.970 --> 00:15:37.980 align:start position:0%
covet is listed others other states
 
00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
um historically if if covid was
 
00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
somewhere on the list or there was covid
 
00:15:45.230 --> 00:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
you know um that get counted as a Cova
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
death we actually ensure that there was
 
00:15:50.269 --> 00:15:50.279 align:start position:0%
a coven positive test as well before we
 
00:15:53.329 --> 00:15:53.339 align:start position:0%
count it as a coveted death again we can
 
00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:54.720 align:start position:0%
spend some time a little bit later
 
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
talking a little bit about the
 
00:15:58.370 --> 00:15:58.380 align:start position:0%
epidemiology behind it but we've uh
 
00:15:59.990 --> 00:16:00.000 align:start position:0%
we've been using a more conservative
 
00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:03.300 align:start position:0%
method to go through review every death
 
00:16:06.410 --> 00:16:06.420 align:start position:0%
certificate and ensure that kovid was
 
00:16:08.030 --> 00:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
the cause of death and Elite or a
 
00:16:09.889 --> 00:16:09.899 align:start position:0%
leading contributor
 
00:16:11.509 --> 00:16:11.519 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:13.129 --> 00:16:13.139 align:start position:0%
um other than covet on this list you'll
 
00:16:15.650 --> 00:16:15.660 align:start position:0%
see things like accidents which is our
 
00:16:18.170 --> 00:16:18.180 align:start position:0%
unintentional deaths which include
 
00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.910 align:start position:0%
unintentional deaths which include
overdoses

00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
overdoses
 
00:16:21.769 --> 00:16:21.779 align:start position:0%
um one I just want to highlight your
 
00:16:24.110 --> 00:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
attention there again those numbers look
 
00:16:26.210 --> 00:16:26.220 align:start position:0%
a little bit low at this point we've
 
00:16:27.590 --> 00:16:27.600 align:start position:0%
certainly all heard the media and have
 
00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:28.740 align:start position:0%
worked with the office of the chief
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
medical examiner to understand that that
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
number is going to go up over time as we
 
00:16:35.569 --> 00:16:35.579 align:start position:0%
finish toxicology reports at the for the
 
00:16:38.509 --> 00:16:38.519 align:start position:0%
end of calendar year 2022. this is very
 
00:16:40.490 --> 00:16:40.500 align:start position:0%
concerning to all of us and it is an
 
00:16:42.170 --> 00:16:42.180 align:start position:0%
example of a place that Public Health
 
00:16:44.150 --> 00:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
Works hand in hand with our division of
 
00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health and with Partners
 
00:16:48.889 --> 00:16:48.899 align:start position:0%
across state agencies and in communities
 
00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:52.860 align:start position:0%
to really address this issue of opioid
 
00:16:55.009 --> 00:16:55.019 align:start position:0%
related or unintentional deaths along
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
the way everything else has remained
 
00:17:00.110 --> 00:17:00.120 align:start position:0%
fairly static over time heart disease
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
cancer chronic lower respiratory disease
 
00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.020 align:start position:0%
that's really emphysema COPD asthma as
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
well as stroke
 
00:17:10.610 --> 00:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
so representative poll has another
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
question thank you under accidents right
 
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:16.260 align:start position:0%
including overdoses my understanding is
 
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
the overdoses were somewhere like 400 to
 
00:17:21.650 --> 00:17:21.660 align:start position:0%
500 round numbers is it time to break
 
00:17:23.929 --> 00:17:23.939 align:start position:0%
that out as a separate category
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
um yes it is an accidental death I get
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
that yeah but it's a significant portion
 
00:17:31.070 --> 00:17:31.080 align:start position:0%
of that accidental death
 
00:17:34.669 --> 00:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
and it some cases has direct ties back
 
00:17:38.029 --> 00:17:38.039 align:start position:0%
to either surroundings lifestyle
 
00:17:39.710 --> 00:17:39.720 align:start position:0%
um mental health a bunch of other things
 
00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:41.700 align:start position:0%
that are that precipitate people right
 
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily want to go
 
00:17:44.930 --> 00:17:44.940 align:start position:0%
overdose that's not right that's not the
 
00:17:47.690 --> 00:17:47.700 align:start position:0%
plan right so since it's probably more
 
00:17:49.490 --> 00:17:49.500 align:start position:0%
than half of that number is it time to
 
00:17:50.930 --> 00:17:50.940 align:start position:0%
break that out as a separate category
 
00:17:52.850 --> 00:17:52.860 align:start position:0%
and track it that way so I
 
00:17:54.169 --> 00:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
great question
 
00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:55.740 align:start position:0%
um thank you for it and I think what
 
00:17:58.130 --> 00:17:58.140 align:start position:0%
we've done by de facto is pull it out
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
the this definition of accidental death
 
00:18:03.529 --> 00:18:03.539 align:start position:0%
is our national definitions that we use
 
00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:05.100 align:start position:0%
for the national Center for Health
 
00:18:07.669 --> 00:18:07.679 align:start position:0%
statistics so that we can compare apples
 
00:18:09.890 --> 00:18:09.900 align:start position:0%
to apples across all states but we
 
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
certainly understand the need for
 
00:18:13.549 --> 00:18:13.559 align:start position:0%
breaking that out to look specifically
 
00:18:15.470 --> 00:18:15.480 align:start position:0%
especially in a state like New Hampshire
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
to address specifically overdose deaths
 
00:18:21.169 --> 00:18:21.179 align:start position:0%
related other than as compared to car
 
00:18:23.810 --> 00:18:23.820 align:start position:0%
crashes or ATV crashes absolutely and
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
maybe you just put an asterisk there and
 
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:28.500 align:start position:0%
somehow tabulate that out it's just it's
 
00:18:30.230 --> 00:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
a meaningful number considering it's
 
00:18:31.850 --> 00:18:31.860 align:start position:0%
more than half of that number for each
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
year absolutely and and I did not
 
00:18:35.570 --> 00:18:35.580 align:start position:0%
provide you the exact number with it
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
right now because again I know that of
 
00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
all the things on the list the overdose
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
is probably the least complete data that
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
we have at this point
 
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
are there other questions
 
00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:53.570 --> 00:18:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I have a question about
 
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
something that isn't listed I wondered
 
00:18:57.590 --> 00:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
do you have the statistics on suicide
 
00:18:59.690 --> 00:18:59.700 align:start position:0%
yes so thank you I don't have that
 
00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
number with me this very moment but it
 
00:19:03.350 --> 00:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
does come down a little bit lower it's
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
usually sort of at the you know it's in
 
00:19:08.029 --> 00:19:08.039 align:start position:0%
the top 10 but somewhere down at the
 
00:19:09.529 --> 00:19:09.539 align:start position:0%
bottom of the top ten I've given you the
 
00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
top six so the suicide number is below
 
00:19:14.390 --> 00:19:14.400 align:start position:0%
you know usually I'm even gonna refrain
 
00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:15.720 align:start position:0%
from just giving you the number off the
 
00:19:16.909 --> 00:19:16.919 align:start position:0%
top my head I can probably find that
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
number for you or if Ian can find that
 
00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:21.480 align:start position:0%
while I'm sitting here but um and the
 
00:19:23.570 --> 00:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
thing about suicide certainly is
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
concerning for adult populations that's
 
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:28.620 align:start position:0%
fairly stable what we have found is the
 
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
Adolescent number sort of does this it's
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit Wiggly luckily it's a
 
00:19:36.289 --> 00:19:36.299 align:start position:0%
relatively small number over time but it
 
00:19:38.570 --> 00:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
does go up and down which is when we
 
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:40.200 align:start position:0%
look at Trends we almost have to look at
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
the trends over time to get a more clear
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
indication of whether the trend is going
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
up or down we really have to combine
 
00:19:46.799 --> 00:19:48.049 align:start position:0%
up or down we really have to combine
years

00:19:48.049 --> 00:19:48.059 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:19:48.059 --> 00:19:50.510 align:start position:0%
years
yeah

00:19:50.510 --> 00:19:50.520 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:19:52.970 --> 00:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
great thank you so if you slide into
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
slide six this is how we meet all our
 
00:19:57.830 --> 00:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
goals this is how public health is
 
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
organized in the upcoming and and this
 
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:03.720 align:start position:0%
is just our bureaus our uh our org chart
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
is sort of unwieldy which is why I
 
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:07.260 align:start position:0%
didn't put it you know do a cut and
 
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
paste you often see many of the other
 
00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:09.960 align:start position:0%
divisions doing cut and paste of their
 
00:20:12.289 --> 00:20:12.299 align:start position:0%
work chart our chart is pretty big so I
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
for the purposes today these are just
 
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:17.880 align:start position:0%
our large bureaus in the upcoming
 
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
biennium we have moved from Seven
 
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:21.780 align:start position:0%
bureaus to eight bureaus and as we go
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
through the budget briefing book we can
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
dig deeper into any of those areas
 
00:20:28.010 --> 00:20:28.020 align:start position:0%
within each Bureau we are splitting the
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
reason we're going up a bureau is we are
 
00:20:32.210 --> 00:20:32.220 align:start position:0%
splitting what is now currently known as
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
The Bureau population health and
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
community services and we're splitting
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
it for a couple of reasons currently it
 
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
contains all of our maternal and child
 
00:20:44.029 --> 00:20:44.039 align:start position:0%
health programs our WIC program our
 
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:45.780 align:start position:0%
chronic disease and cancer prevention
 
00:20:48.710 --> 00:20:48.720 align:start position:0%
programs and smoking cessation and there
 
00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
is such a large number of federal grants
 
00:20:55.370 --> 00:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
within that section that Bureau alone in
 
00:20:58.070 --> 00:20:58.080 align:start position:0%
fact division of Public Health has the
 
00:20:59.690 --> 00:20:59.700 align:start position:0%
most accounting units in the Department
 
00:21:02.029 --> 00:21:02.039 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services the Bureau
 
00:21:03.409 --> 00:21:03.419 align:start position:0%
of population health and Community
 
00:21:05.990 --> 00:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
Services had the most accounting units
 
00:21:08.090 --> 00:21:08.100 align:start position:0%
in the division of Public Health it's
 
00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:10.740 align:start position:0%
more than almost any other area of the
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
department combined so we're splitting
 
00:21:16.730 --> 00:21:16.740 align:start position:0%
that up for ease of administration and
 
00:21:18.770 --> 00:21:18.780 align:start position:0%
really to focus some of the talent that
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
we have there and the leadership to
 
00:21:24.110 --> 00:21:24.120 align:start position:0%
really now focus on the sort of the
 
00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:26.880 align:start position:0%
young child family side and what we've
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
changed that into is now the Bureau of
 
00:21:33.409 --> 00:21:33.419 align:start position:0%
Family Wellness and nutrition and then
 
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
we our family health and nutrition and
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
then the chronic disease cancer smoking
 
00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:40.320 align:start position:0%
side is going to be the Bureau of
 
00:21:42.830 --> 00:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
prevention and Wellness
 
00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:46.580 align:start position:0%
so I will so on the surface
 
00:21:49.250 --> 00:21:49.260 align:start position:0%
one could think that there's some
 
00:21:51.830 --> 00:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
redundancy here because you have a
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
bureau that deals with Equity issues and
 
00:21:56.690 --> 00:21:56.700 align:start position:0%
then and the office the commissioner we
 
00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
have seven people who who deal with
 
00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
Equity issues so could could you take us
 
00:22:03.649 --> 00:22:03.659 align:start position:0%
a little deeper to help us understand
 
00:22:05.810 --> 00:22:05.820 align:start position:0%
that there's not redundancy thank you
 
00:22:06.710 --> 00:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
that's a great question and
 
00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
representative so we have this bear
 
00:22:11.450 --> 00:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
Health Access equity and policy really
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
everything that we do is infused with
 
00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
the notion of equity you know we want to
 
00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:16.380 align:start position:0%
make sure that we reduce Health
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
disparities across the board by any
 
00:22:19.970 --> 00:22:19.980 align:start position:0%
groups of people and sometimes that's
 
00:22:21.970 --> 00:22:21.980 align:start position:0%
racial and ethnic sometimes it's rural
 
00:22:24.710 --> 00:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
non-rural sometimes it's age there's all
 
00:22:26.510 --> 00:22:26.520 align:start position:0%
sorts of ways you can cut that pie when
 
00:22:28.430 --> 00:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
you're looking at Health disparities in
 
00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480 align:start position:0%
that particular Bureau
 
00:22:34.789 --> 00:22:34.799 align:start position:0%
um that has is uh is focused on Rural
 
00:22:36.890 --> 00:22:36.900 align:start position:0%
health and primary care so again sort of
 
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
a rural non-rural area we also have some
 
00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
equity in terms of some access to
 
00:22:45.110 --> 00:22:45.120 align:start position:0%
services so our therapeutic cannabis
 
00:22:48.049 --> 00:22:48.059 align:start position:0%
program is in there our pdmp is in that
 
00:22:50.570 --> 00:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
program and historically
 
00:22:53.630 --> 00:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
um it has also held a new uh funding
 
00:22:55.310 --> 00:22:55.320 align:start position:0%
source which was our health disparities
 
00:22:57.289 --> 00:22:57.299 align:start position:0%
Grant which I know representative
 
00:22:59.029 --> 00:22:59.039 align:start position:0%
Edwards that you're familiar with we've
 
00:23:00.649 --> 00:23:00.659 align:start position:0%
talked about that over time that was
 
00:23:03.409 --> 00:23:03.419 align:start position:0%
really designed to be a large funding
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
source to address issues of equity so
 
00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:07.620 align:start position:0%
that's very different compared to the
 
00:23:09.049 --> 00:23:09.059 align:start position:0%
office of Health Equity as it's
 
00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:10.500 align:start position:0%
currently standing they're doing a lot
 
00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:12.900 align:start position:0%
of class standards you know making sure
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
communication and language access is
 
00:23:17.149 --> 00:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
available to the entire department and
 
00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:19.380 align:start position:0%
also I'm very excited with Reuben
 
00:23:20.930 --> 00:23:20.940 align:start position:0%
Hampton who's joined that to really
 
00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299 align:start position:0%
provide that overall arching issue you
 
00:23:26.090 --> 00:23:26.100 align:start position:0%
know sort of thought leadership around
 
00:23:27.529 --> 00:23:27.539 align:start position:0%
what Health Equity looks in the
 
00:23:29.930 --> 00:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
department our Bureau is much more
 
00:23:33.230 --> 00:23:33.240 align:start position:0%
Hands-On and in the weeds
 
00:23:35.810 --> 00:23:35.820 align:start position:0%
all right thank you
 
00:23:38.149 --> 00:23:38.159 align:start position:0%
um we can scoot into slide seven then
 
00:23:40.190 --> 00:23:40.200 align:start position:0%
and so here's your here's where you're
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
going to see just a few of the
 
00:23:42.830 --> 00:23:42.840 align:start position:0%
accomplishments of our incredibly
 
00:23:44.450 --> 00:23:44.460 align:start position:0%
talented team
 
00:23:46.789 --> 00:23:46.799 align:start position:0%
um first of all you know again I I get
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
it that the rest of the world is tired
 
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:49.620 align:start position:0%
of covid
 
00:23:51.289 --> 00:23:51.299 align:start position:0%
um but I do want to acknowledge the work
 
00:23:53.810 --> 00:23:53.820 align:start position:0%
of that and that the work continues
 
00:23:56.210 --> 00:23:56.220 align:start position:0%
behind the scenes to support things like
 
00:23:58.370 --> 00:23:58.380 align:start position:0%
our long-term care facilities
 
00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
um and to support hospitals trying to
 
00:24:02.029 --> 00:24:02.039 align:start position:0%
keep people out of the hospital that is
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
the metric you know hospitalization and
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
death are the metrics that are North
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
Star around covid right now and we still
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
have people with covid um and we're you
 
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
know hospitals are still impacted we
 
00:24:15.649 --> 00:24:15.659 align:start position:0%
were very fortunate
 
00:24:17.390 --> 00:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
um that this year we did not have the
 
00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
spike in the same way that we did last
 
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:21.720 align:start position:0%
year at this time we're all happy I
 
00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.370 align:start position:0%
year at this time we're all happy I
think

00:24:22.370 --> 00:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:24:23.810 --> 00:24:23.820 align:start position:0%
um you know a number of people would
 
00:24:25.549 --> 00:24:25.559 align:start position:0%
suggest that is because of things like
 
00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:26.750 align:start position:0%
suggest that is because of things like
vaccine

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
vaccine
 
00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
um but it is also because we've got easy
 
00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:31.020 align:start position:0%
testing capability and quite frankly
 
00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics Therapeutics have been a
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
game change it keeping people out of the
 
00:24:38.090 --> 00:24:38.100 align:start position:0%
hospital you'll notice that also as as
 
00:24:39.950 --> 00:24:39.960 align:start position:0%
earlier noted that we have some
 
00:24:42.470 --> 00:24:42.480 align:start position:0%
sponsored social media posts one of
 
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
those sponsored social media posts is to
 
00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:45.600 align:start position:0%
really highlight that we have a
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics program that anybody can
 
00:24:50.390 --> 00:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
use to get Telehealth Services you test
 
00:24:53.090 --> 00:24:53.100 align:start position:0%
positive for covid especially if you're
 
00:24:55.250 --> 00:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
50 and over you can call them up get an
 
00:24:57.169 --> 00:24:57.179 align:start position:0%
appointment that day on Telehealth and
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
get Therapeutics at your Pharmacy within
 
00:25:02.029 --> 00:25:02.039 align:start position:0%
a couple of hours it's quite frankly one
 
00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
of the best programs that I've had the
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
privilege to oversee I get random emails
 
00:25:08.930 --> 00:25:08.940 align:start position:0%
all the time from the public saying
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
thank you for making that available my
 
00:25:12.409 --> 00:25:12.419 align:start position:0%
doctor wasn't available it was Saturday
 
00:25:14.870 --> 00:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
or something and I was able to get the
 
00:25:17.330 --> 00:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
care that I needed right away so I just
 
00:25:18.710 --> 00:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
want to highlight that as an
 
00:25:22.789 --> 00:25:22.799 align:start position:0%
accomplishment of the past year I think
 
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.120 align:start position:0%
um the other place where we've had
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
significant accomplishments and and we
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
spoke a little bit about the last time I
 
00:25:30.169 --> 00:25:30.179 align:start position:0%
was I was talking with you is really
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
around how we've modernized our Data
 
00:25:34.250 --> 00:25:34.260 align:start position:0%
Systems we've we're worked hand in hand
 
00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:35.940 align:start position:0%
with Dave Wieters and our Bureau of
 
00:25:37.549 --> 00:25:37.559 align:start position:0%
Information Services with our department
 
00:25:41.450 --> 00:25:41.460 align:start position:0%
of Information Technology do it and
 
00:25:43.370 --> 00:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
others to modernize electronic case
 
00:25:45.529 --> 00:25:45.539 align:start position:0%
reporting modernize electronic lab
 
00:25:47.269 --> 00:25:47.279 align:start position:0%
reporting we've built and
 
00:25:48.950 --> 00:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
operationalized our immunization
 
00:25:51.649 --> 00:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
information system and our public data
 
00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
portal continues to become more robust
 
00:25:56.149 --> 00:25:56.159 align:start position:0%
again something that we're very proud of
 
00:25:59.529 --> 00:25:59.539 align:start position:0%
a lot more work to do but we've really
 
00:26:03.230 --> 00:26:03.240 align:start position:0%
moved in light years through the pan f
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
as a result of the pandemic in some of
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
our ways to report timely data and make
 
00:26:11.090 --> 00:26:11.100 align:start position:0%
it a transparent to the public and
 
00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:13.559 align:start position:0%
finally I'm extremely proud of the work
 
00:26:15.230 --> 00:26:15.240 align:start position:0%
that we have done to support kids and
 
00:26:18.409 --> 00:26:18.419 align:start position:0%
families and really focusing on
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
prevention you may recall last time at
 
00:26:23.390 --> 00:26:23.400 align:start position:0%
this year not only where we had a spike
 
00:26:25.970 --> 00:26:25.980 align:start position:0%
of covid we also had no infant formula
 
00:26:27.769 --> 00:26:27.779 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and we had
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
kids you know parents you know across
 
00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
the board and across the economic
 
00:26:34.669 --> 00:26:34.679 align:start position:0%
spectrum who who literally could not
 
00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:36.440 align:start position:0%
feed their children
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
extraordinarily hard not only with our
 
00:26:40.909 --> 00:26:40.919 align:start position:0%
WIC participants again the women infant
 
00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
children feeding program to make sure
 
00:26:45.169 --> 00:26:45.179 align:start position:0%
that all of those families who were
 
00:26:48.430 --> 00:26:48.440 align:start position:0%
really the most vulnerable had access to
 
00:26:51.049 --> 00:26:51.059 align:start position:0%
formula no matter where they were but we
 
00:26:52.730 --> 00:26:52.740 align:start position:0%
were also Fielding phone calls from
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
regular old citizens across the state
 
00:26:57.769 --> 00:26:57.779 align:start position:0%
saying where how can I access what's a
 
00:26:59.870 --> 00:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
good substitution help me through this
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
process it was incredibly stressful for
 
00:27:04.669 --> 00:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
new families last year and I am thankful
 
00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
that we are done with that the Abbott
 
00:27:09.470 --> 00:27:09.480 align:start position:0%
Factory is back up and running and we
 
00:27:12.769 --> 00:27:12.779 align:start position:0%
are returning now to more a more regular
 
00:27:16.010 --> 00:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
scope of business but again as a as a
 
00:27:17.690 --> 00:27:17.700 align:start position:0%
highlight of last year's accomplishment
 
00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:19.500 align:start position:0%
that's one that has been sort of quiet
 
00:27:21.470 --> 00:27:21.480 align:start position:0%
because it was also during you know
 
00:27:23.570 --> 00:27:23.580 align:start position:0%
covet every again the media was focused
 
00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:25.740 align:start position:0%
on covid many of us were focused on the
 
00:27:28.909 --> 00:27:28.919 align:start position:0%
fact that babies didn't have food to eat
 
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:31.740 align:start position:0%
so we can look at the challenges now so
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
those were some of the things that were
 
00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:34.250 align:start position:0%
those were some of the things that were
great

00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:27:37.430 --> 00:27:37.440 align:start position:0%
um I think um slide eight shows
 
00:27:39.710 --> 00:27:39.720 align:start position:0%
um some of the challenges we continue to
 
00:27:42.169 --> 00:27:42.179 align:start position:0%
face as we look forward to the next
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
biennium we know that we're going to
 
00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:46.740 align:start position:0%
need to continue to address the
 
00:27:49.149 --> 00:27:49.159 align:start position:0%
long-term impacts of the pandemic
 
00:27:51.710 --> 00:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
primarily we have seen that the use of
 
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:53.940 align:start position:0%
preventative Services plummeted and I
 
00:27:55.669 --> 00:27:55.679 align:start position:0%
think we know that we've heard that in
 
00:27:57.890 --> 00:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
the media but we've seen that play out
 
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of things like a reduction in
 
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:01.860 align:start position:0%
mammograms a reduction of cervical
 
00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:03.960 align:start position:0%
cancer screening a reduction in lead
 
00:28:06.409 --> 00:28:06.419 align:start position:0%
screening for kids all of that has
 
00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:08.400 align:start position:0%
happened over the past two years and so
 
00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:11.220 align:start position:0%
we will see the impacts of that yes
 
00:28:14.510 --> 00:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
so I love visual information I'm just
 
00:28:16.909 --> 00:28:16.919 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to interpret
 
00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:20.220 align:start position:0%
slide eight yeah it looks like if I were
 
00:28:23.529 --> 00:28:23.539 align:start position:0%
to read it is the way I want I want to
 
00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
is that the base of all of these other
 
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:30.000 align:start position:0%
things above it is that we have adverse
 
00:28:32.210 --> 00:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
training and health conditions are the
 
00:28:34.430 --> 00:28:34.440 align:start position:0%
colors and sequence and size of the
 
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
blocks meant to communicate about it is
 
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
that it is also scale of the problem I
 
00:28:40.789 --> 00:28:40.799 align:start position:0%
don't think that one it isn't designed
 
00:28:42.649 --> 00:28:42.659 align:start position:0%
to show causation or even necessarily
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
correlation but just really scope yeah
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
so this is just um relative
 
00:28:51.049 --> 00:28:51.059 align:start position:0%
impact yes thank you for that question
 
00:28:52.549 --> 00:28:52.559 align:start position:0%
um so again we're going to see those
 
00:28:54.289 --> 00:28:54.299 align:start position:0%
adverse trending we've also seen that in
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
terms of Behavioral Health that is also
 
00:28:58.549 --> 00:28:58.559 align:start position:0%
in all of our media feeds right now we
 
00:29:00.710 --> 00:29:00.720 align:start position:0%
know the impact to adolescents we know
 
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:02.940 align:start position:0%
the impact as well to adults and we're
 
00:29:05.330 --> 00:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
feeling that now so that's going to
 
00:29:07.730 --> 00:29:07.740 align:start position:0%
impact all of our programs
 
00:29:09.470 --> 00:29:09.480 align:start position:0%
um we continue you know if I go to the
 
00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
top of that I look at things like
 
00:29:13.010 --> 00:29:13.020 align:start position:0%
environmental threats that did not go
 
00:29:15.549 --> 00:29:15.559 align:start position:0%
away during the pandemic we continue to
 
00:29:18.049 --> 00:29:18.059 align:start position:0%
try and manage our way and better
 
00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:22.220 align:start position:0%
understand the responses to things like
 
00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
increased excess cases of cancer in
 
00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
Southern New Hampshire so those are
 
00:29:31.250 --> 00:29:31.260 align:start position:0%
continuing to focus our time yes sir
 
00:29:34.549 --> 00:29:34.559 align:start position:0%
okay so now I understand it it you're
 
00:29:36.769 --> 00:29:36.779 align:start position:0%
you're saying that your Workforce issues
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
are enormously impactful I am but
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
nevertheless the adverse trending and
 
00:29:45.110 --> 00:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
long-term impacts of the pandemic are
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
even yet more significant so they they
 
00:29:50.029 --> 00:29:50.039 align:start position:0%
are related to some degree as we have
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
more work to do we also are facing this
 
00:29:55.610 --> 00:29:55.620 align:start position:0%
Workforce challenge that everybody is
 
00:29:57.289 --> 00:29:57.299 align:start position:0%
facing so so I'm just trying to
 
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
understand because I understand the
 
00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:00.960 align:start position:0%
workforce issue that's enormous it is
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
enormous but but like if you could reach
 
00:30:05.930 --> 00:30:05.940 align:start position:0%
in and pull out of the guts of of the
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
bigger bar what what do you see as the
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
long-term impacts that are even more
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
consequential in terms of health out
 
00:30:16.130 --> 00:30:16.140 align:start position:0%
Health outcomes public health challenges
 
00:30:19.850 --> 00:30:19.860 align:start position:0%
how is it that are we we are true our
 
00:30:21.409 --> 00:30:21.419 align:start position:0%
health conditions are trending so
 
00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:24.120 align:start position:0%
negatively where we have specific
 
00:30:27.049 --> 00:30:27.059 align:start position:0%
long-term impacts of the pandemic
 
00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:30.620 align:start position:0%
such that that's an even bigger problem
 
00:30:33.649 --> 00:30:33.659 align:start position:0%
than the workforce so I
 
00:30:36.110 --> 00:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
went hand in hand so the the
 
00:30:37.730 --> 00:30:37.740 align:start position:0%
trending that's going to be be something
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
that we also don't know enough about
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
right now that's the whole point like
 
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
the trends are gonna go that are going
 
00:30:44.810 --> 00:30:44.820 align:start position:0%
in a different direction we're going to
 
00:30:47.690 --> 00:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
have to figure out along the way what's
 
00:30:50.750 --> 00:30:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to change our change our priority
 
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:53.820 align:start position:0%
and change the focus of what we do and
 
00:30:55.549 --> 00:30:55.559 align:start position:0%
some of that is yet to we're going to
 
00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:57.059 align:start position:0%
have to figure that out when that comes
 
00:30:59.630 --> 00:30:59.640 align:start position:0%
when we see those impacts there's also
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
things like long covet we don't know
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
what long covet's going to mean for
 
00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
people we don't know if there will be
 
00:31:07.190 --> 00:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
additional resources and then the other
 
00:31:09.769 --> 00:31:09.779 align:start position:0%
piece is just demographic as we've seen
 
00:31:12.649 --> 00:31:12.659 align:start position:0%
you know our our population is older as
 
00:31:15.950 --> 00:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
we all know and as that baby boomer
 
00:31:19.490 --> 00:31:19.500 align:start position:0%
population gets older we don't know how
 
00:31:21.830 --> 00:31:21.840 align:start position:0%
we are going to have you know how to
 
00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
respond to what will be the problems of
 
00:31:27.649 --> 00:31:27.659 align:start position:0%
the future what I when I look into my
 
00:31:29.930 --> 00:31:29.940 align:start position:0%
crystal ball I certainly understand that
 
00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:31.740 align:start position:0%
with a lack of preventative Services
 
00:31:34.430 --> 00:31:34.440 align:start position:0%
cancer screening is probably the best if
 
00:31:36.529 --> 00:31:36.539 align:start position:0%
you don't catch those cancers early it
 
00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:39.240 align:start position:0%
leads to worse outcomes I mean that's a
 
00:31:42.110 --> 00:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
pretty simple direct line the workforce
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
is side by side with that and we have
 
00:31:46.010 --> 00:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
the same challenges that everybody else
 
00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:48.240 align:start position:0%
has um you know we are not special in
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
that way the only thing that makes us
 
00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:52.620 align:start position:0%
you know just have a different focus on
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
it is the types of people we need to do
 
00:31:57.830 --> 00:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
the work in public health we have
 
00:31:59.930 --> 00:31:59.940 align:start position:0%
um you know almost 50 percent of our
 
00:32:02.029 --> 00:32:02.039 align:start position:0%
staff have advanced or not just
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
bachelor's degree but have advanced
 
00:32:05.930 --> 00:32:05.940 align:start position:0%
degrees we have almost 20 percent of our
 
00:32:08.450 --> 00:32:08.460 align:start position:0%
staff have phds and these are folks that
 
00:32:10.549 --> 00:32:10.559 align:start position:0%
can go out into the world and make a lot
 
00:32:12.350 --> 00:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
more money than working for for public
 
00:32:13.970 --> 00:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
health right now they do it because the
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
work is important that's the that's the
 
00:32:18.230 --> 00:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
thing we give to people is an incredible
 
00:32:19.909 --> 00:32:19.919 align:start position:0%
sense of mission an incredible sense of
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
accomplishment and importance of their
 
00:32:23.450 --> 00:32:23.460 align:start position:0%
work but the end of the day people have
 
00:32:25.010 --> 00:32:25.020 align:start position:0%
to pay their mortgage and and they're
 
00:32:26.930 --> 00:32:26.940 align:start position:0%
going to have to make those choices and
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
not only is it an impact for the
 
00:32:29.930 --> 00:32:29.940 align:start position:0%
workforce of the division of Public
 
00:32:32.269 --> 00:32:32.279 align:start position:0%
Health Services we have equally seen
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
that as Workforce issues in the
 
00:32:36.529 --> 00:32:36.539 align:start position:0%
community so when we have you know we
 
00:32:39.049 --> 00:32:39.059 align:start position:0%
have been inundated with some covid
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
money to do some interesting things out
 
00:32:42.889 --> 00:32:42.899 align:start position:0%
in the community we could come up with
 
00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:44.700 align:start position:0%
great ideas we may have even had great
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
ideas before the pandemic we say Okay
 
00:32:50.510 --> 00:32:50.520 align:start position:0%
Community partner here's the time to do
 
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
this great job this great work that
 
00:32:53.930 --> 00:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
you've always wanted to do and they say
 
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:55.740 align:start position:0%
I'd love to do that but I don't have any
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
staff and so that's the downstream
 
00:33:01.130 --> 00:33:01.140 align:start position:0%
effect of some of this is that our
 
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
health care providers don't have staff
 
00:33:04.310 --> 00:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
our community service providers don't
 
00:33:06.950 --> 00:33:06.960 align:start position:0%
have staff and so even if we have great
 
00:33:10.610 --> 00:33:10.620 align:start position:0%
ideas and the cash today to do it
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
um that's been a concerning Factor as we
 
00:33:14.630 --> 00:33:14.640 align:start position:0%
move forward
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
so I think that you know again for this
 
00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:19.740 align:start position:0%
slide those are our big issues we've got
 
00:33:21.470 --> 00:33:21.480 align:start position:0%
we've got some health problems in the
 
00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:22.980 align:start position:0%
future that we don't really know about
 
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:25.260 align:start position:0%
we've got some Workforce and we're going
 
00:33:26.870 --> 00:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
to ongo we're going to continue to have
 
00:33:28.250 --> 00:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
to figure out
 
00:33:30.289 --> 00:33:30.299 align:start position:0%
um how do we plan representative
 
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:32.880 align:start position:0%
Stringham uh thanks since you brought up
 
00:33:35.750 --> 00:33:35.760 align:start position:0%
long-term covered and as part of the uh
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
in the category of adverse trending of
 
00:33:41.210 --> 00:33:41.220 align:start position:0%
health conditions uh how many people do
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
we have with long-term coven uh and uh
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
what's the mix of how severe they are
 
00:33:50.990 --> 00:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
and um and what are the resources
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
um that are worth trying to address that
 
00:33:55.610 --> 00:33:55.620 align:start position:0%
to understand that issue or address that
 
00:33:57.950 --> 00:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
issue the short answer is we don't know
 
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
we don't have a way in which to count
 
00:34:02.509 --> 00:34:02.519 align:start position:0%
that and get that data in a way that's
 
00:34:05.269 --> 00:34:05.279 align:start position:0%
meaningful right now there's no
 
00:34:08.389 --> 00:34:08.399 align:start position:0%
um standard way to code that it would
 
00:34:10.369 --> 00:34:10.379 align:start position:0%
take us a while to get that data even if
 
00:34:12.109 --> 00:34:12.119 align:start position:0%
we did we typically when we look at
 
00:34:15.349 --> 00:34:15.359 align:start position:0%
health health outcomes we usually have
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
some standard data sources whether
 
00:34:18.290 --> 00:34:18.300 align:start position:0%
that's something like our behavioral
 
00:34:21.409 --> 00:34:21.419 align:start position:0%
risk factor survey which is a random
 
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
survey that people say yep I've got
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
heart disease and I've got asthma you
 
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%
know and that's how we Trend those
 
00:34:29.810 --> 00:34:29.820 align:start position:0%
things we also use Hospital data again
 
00:34:32.450 --> 00:34:32.460 align:start position:0%
to try to try and Trend some of those
 
00:34:35.030 --> 00:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
health conditions but typically there
 
00:34:37.730 --> 00:34:37.740 align:start position:0%
are ICD-9 ICD-10 codes that we can count
 
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
on to do that all of this is new for us
 
00:34:42.349 --> 00:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
so we don't know if someone's having
 
00:34:45.349 --> 00:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
long-term neurological symptoms is that
 
00:34:47.570 --> 00:34:47.580 align:start position:0%
because of long covet or is it not I
 
00:34:49.310 --> 00:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
anticipate this is a place over the next
 
00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:51.899 align:start position:0%
two years where we're going to refine as
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
a country how do we count that data so
 
00:34:56.149 --> 00:34:56.159 align:start position:0%
that we can understand how to approach
 
00:34:57.530 --> 00:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
it and then work with our clinical
 
00:34:59.990 --> 00:35:00.000 align:start position:0%
partners to understand what are the
 
00:35:01.550 --> 00:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
interventions that need to be put in
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
place again it's sort of this fuzzy
 
00:35:05.150 --> 00:35:05.160 align:start position:0%
thing that we know is out there but I
 
00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:09.180 align:start position:0%
can't give you a hard number on it
 
00:35:11.870 --> 00:35:11.880 align:start position:0%
I'm representative
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
So when you say you know it's this fuzzy
 
00:35:16.010 --> 00:35:16.020 align:start position:0%
thing that's kind of out there how do
 
00:35:17.690 --> 00:35:17.700 align:start position:0%
you know is out there certainly from the
 
00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:19.550 align:start position:0%
you know is out there certainly from the
art

00:35:19.550 --> 00:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
art
 
00:35:21.829 --> 00:35:21.839 align:start position:0%
information from our clinical Partners
 
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
In the state we also there are also some
 
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:27.480 align:start position:0%
smaller studies the CDC and others and
 
00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:29.339 align:start position:0%
um have been working hard at trying to
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
get some of that data in very prescribed
 
00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:33.960 align:start position:0%
ways working with specific Hospital
 
00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
Systems across the the country to really
 
00:35:39.470 --> 00:35:39.480 align:start position:0%
dig down and do the sort of out data
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
abstracting that you would need to do
 
00:35:43.910 --> 00:35:43.920 align:start position:0%
going into the depths of those emrs to
 
00:35:45.950 --> 00:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
pull that information out we're not
 
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
ready as a country yet to have a you
 
00:35:50.329 --> 00:35:50.339 align:start position:0%
know to go Prime Time with a methodology
 
00:35:53.030 --> 00:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to get all of that data to
 
00:35:56.390 --> 00:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
have a a broad picture that is
 
00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:58.560 align:start position:0%
representative of everyone but we've
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
certainly seen through certain studies
 
00:36:02.210 --> 00:36:02.220 align:start position:0%
of certain health systems that it's
 
00:36:02.220 --> 00:36:03.170 align:start position:0%
of certain health systems that it's
there

00:36:03.170 --> 00:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
you provide those studies please excuse
 
00:36:06.530 --> 00:36:06.540 align:start position:0%
me can you provide those studies please
 
00:36:08.210 --> 00:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
we will do that thank you
 
00:36:10.430 --> 00:36:10.440 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you follow up
 
00:36:12.829 --> 00:36:12.839 align:start position:0%
on representative herff's question is it
 
00:36:14.329 --> 00:36:14.339 align:start position:0%
possible to work with one of the major
 
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
hospitals or their groups to try and get
 
00:36:20.329 --> 00:36:20.339 align:start position:0%
a statistical sampling for long covid
 
00:36:22.430 --> 00:36:22.440 align:start position:0%
and I say that because I hear a lot
 
00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
about it through personal networks but
 
00:36:26.390 --> 00:36:26.400 align:start position:0%
there's nothing I can point to in New
 
00:36:28.730 --> 00:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that says this is
 
00:36:30.950 --> 00:36:30.960 align:start position:0%
one in five one in ten whatever the
 
00:36:32.630 --> 00:36:32.640 align:start position:0%
number is I don't have a reference for
 
00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:34.140 align:start position:0%
for how
 
00:36:36.349 --> 00:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
um severe the the
 
00:36:39.710 --> 00:36:39.720 align:start position:0%
total is I am concerned that we haven't
 
00:36:42.410 --> 00:36:42.420 align:start position:0%
done much to address right there are
 
00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:45.420 align:start position:0%
whether it's cognitive whether it's
 
00:36:47.150 --> 00:36:47.160 align:start position:0%
um respiratory there's a number of side
 
00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:48.410 align:start position:0%
um respiratory there's a number of side
effects

00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
effects
 
00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:50.820 align:start position:0%
um Beyond just kind of aches and feeling
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
groggy yes thank you so that that's a
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
great idea I don't you know this is a
 
00:36:58.130 --> 00:36:58.140 align:start position:0%
place it's the budget meeting it's
 
00:36:59.630 --> 00:36:59.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal meeting I don't have a particular
 
00:37:01.490 --> 00:37:01.500 align:start position:0%
pot of money to do that work I'll just
 
00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:02.760 align:start position:0%
be honest
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't mean that we can't work
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
and engage with our partners to help
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
understand that
 
00:37:10.370 --> 00:37:10.380 align:start position:0%
um you know I I think we're going to
 
00:37:11.870 --> 00:37:11.880 align:start position:0%
look to some of these studies I know
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
that there's something called an mmwr
 
00:37:16.730 --> 00:37:16.740 align:start position:0%
which is the cdc's weekly reports that
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
are of like Health reports that's where
 
00:37:20.690 --> 00:37:20.700 align:start position:0%
we've seen some of those other long-term
 
00:37:24.530 --> 00:37:24.540 align:start position:0%
covid studies it's called the more more
 
00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:26.220 align:start position:0%
mortality and morbidity weekly report
 
00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:28.190 align:start position:0%
mortality and morbidity weekly report
mmwr

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.200 align:start position:0%
mmwr
 
00:37:29.750 --> 00:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
um and so that's certainly a
 
00:37:31.010 --> 00:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
conversation that we can continue to
 
00:37:33.230 --> 00:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
have with folks like Dr Chan and others
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
who are working with our clinical
 
00:37:37.370 --> 00:37:37.380 align:start position:0%
providers to get a finer point on how do
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
we count in New Hampshire but I and I'm
 
00:37:41.810 --> 00:37:41.820 align:start position:0%
sure you can appreciate the methodology
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
of counting we want to do that correctly
 
00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:44.990 align:start position:0%
of counting we want to do that correctly
great

00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.089 align:start position:0%
great
okay

00:37:47.089 --> 00:37:47.099 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:37:48.950 --> 00:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:50.569 --> 00:37:50.579 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
um so it's slide nine um this is just an
 
00:37:55.010 --> 00:37:55.020 align:start position:0%
added fun slide
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
um I asked my staff the other day so
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
what you saw previously in slide eight
 
00:38:00.710 --> 00:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
that's sort of our leadership and our
 
00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:02.160 align:start position:0%
staff sort of saying these are the
 
00:38:03.650 --> 00:38:03.660 align:start position:0%
things that we know
 
00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
um are going to be challenges moving
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
forward forward I asked my staff the
 
00:38:08.930 --> 00:38:08.940 align:start position:0%
other day at a staff meeting I said so
 
00:38:10.370 --> 00:38:10.380 align:start position:0%
what are the three things getting in
 
00:38:12.770 --> 00:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
your way of getting your job done
 
00:38:14.870 --> 00:38:14.880 align:start position:0%
um and so you know there's it's
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
Workforce it's money it's um you know
 
00:38:20.470 --> 00:38:20.480 align:start position:0%
training all of those things one of the
 
00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
experiences that we've had through covid
 
00:38:24.829 --> 00:38:24.839 align:start position:0%
is that while we have been blessed with
 
00:38:28.010 --> 00:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
large pots of money in some areas that
 
00:38:30.290 --> 00:38:30.300 align:start position:0%
money is not flexible and it cannot be
 
00:38:32.390 --> 00:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
spread widely you know we get money for
 
00:38:34.910 --> 00:38:34.920 align:start position:0%
immunization we get money to do a
 
00:38:38.150 --> 00:38:38.160 align:start position:0%
certain thing here we have pockets of
 
00:38:39.829 --> 00:38:39.839 align:start position:0%
the division that have gotten no extra
 
00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
money and in fact have gotten cut over
 
00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
time so while you know our overall
 
00:38:45.589 --> 00:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
budget has increased and we're thankful
 
00:38:48.410 --> 00:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
for that it is unequal across all areas
 
00:38:50.750 --> 00:38:50.760 align:start position:0%
and I think that this reflects that as
 
00:38:52.730 --> 00:38:52.740 align:start position:0%
well our staff's feeling you know I
 
00:38:54.950 --> 00:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
think the other pieces that they feel as
 
00:38:57.170 --> 00:38:57.180 align:start position:0%
well like everyone they are coming out
 
00:38:58.910 --> 00:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
of feeling burnt out
 
00:39:01.310 --> 00:39:01.320 align:start position:0%
um you know many of my staff as I've
 
00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:03.300 align:start position:0%
often you know reminded folks we're
 
00:39:07.010 --> 00:39:07.020 align:start position:0%
working for years at you know 24 7 Pace
 
00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:09.720 align:start position:0%
we had two two shifts of laboratory
 
00:39:11.870 --> 00:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
working we were just working non-stop
 
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
and I think sort of like the long-term
 
00:39:16.310 --> 00:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
effects of the pandemic it's only now
 
00:39:17.990 --> 00:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
that folks are starting to take a breath
 
00:39:20.270 --> 00:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
and to feel they've been working on
 
00:39:22.970 --> 00:39:22.980 align:start position:0%
adrenaline for so long and that has
 
00:39:24.829 --> 00:39:24.839 align:start position:0%
impact over years
 
00:39:26.390 --> 00:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
um and so we're feeling that we've seen
 
00:39:29.210 --> 00:39:29.220 align:start position:0%
folks retire I think mostly because they
 
00:39:30.770 --> 00:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
were age-appropriate to retire and that
 
00:39:33.410 --> 00:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
was our age four you know Workforce and
 
00:39:35.569 --> 00:39:35.579 align:start position:0%
we've seen some moving around the thing
 
00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
that we have that's supportive however
 
00:39:40.250 --> 00:39:40.260 align:start position:0%
is this incredible purpose to the work
 
00:39:42.530 --> 00:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
and that is what has kept people engaged
 
00:39:45.710 --> 00:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
so so you I I think there's a theme in
 
00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.750 align:start position:0%
so so you I I think there's a theme in
here

00:39:46.750 --> 00:39:46.760 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:39:50.930 --> 00:39:50.940 align:start position:0%
that you have more accounts than most
 
00:39:55.609 --> 00:39:55.619 align:start position:0%
departments you get these targeted stove
 
00:39:58.550 --> 00:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
pipe programs that come come at you from
 
00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:00.680 align:start position:0%
the federal government
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
it's causing issues in your Workforce
 
00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:07.619 align:start position:0%
the the there's not the flexibility so
 
00:40:10.849 --> 00:40:10.859 align:start position:0%
so isn't there a way to go back to the
 
00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:13.500 align:start position:0%
feds and try to get some waivers and get
 
00:40:15.890 --> 00:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
some relief so that all this money that
 
00:40:17.810 --> 00:40:17.820 align:start position:0%
they're putting in uh has some
 
00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.089 align:start position:0%
they're putting in uh has some
flexibility

00:40:20.089 --> 00:40:20.099 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you I I yes
 
00:40:26.030 --> 00:40:26.040 align:start position:0%
um we don't have waiver Authority in the
 
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
way that CMS does CDC it you have to
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
sort of the logic model that goes all
 
00:40:34.010 --> 00:40:34.020 align:start position:0%
the way back Congress starts with their
 
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
Appropriations so you know they say you
 
00:40:38.030 --> 00:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
will CDC you're going to spend this much
 
00:40:39.470 --> 00:40:39.480 align:start position:0%
money on cancer and you're going to
 
00:40:41.569 --> 00:40:41.579 align:start position:0%
spend this much money on this and then
 
00:40:44.030 --> 00:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
CDC operationalizes what they get from
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
the federal government and they have
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
heard from All State Health officials
 
00:40:50.750 --> 00:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
including myself like please stop with
 
00:40:53.870 --> 00:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
the massively stove piped funding or to
 
00:40:56.329 --> 00:40:56.339 align:start position:0%
allow us some flexibility the good news
 
00:40:58.970 --> 00:40:58.980 align:start position:0%
is we have a couple of funding sources
 
00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
from them that have allowed us to do
 
00:41:02.690 --> 00:41:02.700 align:start position:0%
that that's been a little bit more
 
00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
flexible to focus on Workforce to work
 
00:41:07.069 --> 00:41:07.079 align:start position:0%
on public health infrastructure in
 
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:09.060 align:start position:0%
general so we're we know that they have
 
00:41:11.089 --> 00:41:11.099 align:start position:0%
heard us that way it hasn't fixed the
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
problem but they have certainly heard
 
00:41:14.569 --> 00:41:14.579 align:start position:0%
not only New Hampshire but most States
 
00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:16.140 align:start position:0%
at this point
 
00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you so on slide 10 you'll see what
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
I think is sort of the the big takeaways
 
00:41:23.089 --> 00:41:23.099 align:start position:0%
from today that are not programmatic but
 
00:41:25.609 --> 00:41:25.619 align:start position:0%
this is our budget so we've got 124
 
00:41:28.010 --> 00:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
million total budget again that's not
 
00:41:29.390 --> 00:41:29.400 align:start position:0%
the coveted money we talked about the
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
covid money before
 
00:41:33.770 --> 00:41:33.780 align:start position:0%
um this is our regular old budget about
 
00:41:36.890 --> 00:41:36.900 align:start position:0%
124 million only about 15 of it is
 
00:41:38.270 --> 00:41:38.280 align:start position:0%
General funds there's not a lot of
 
00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:39.780 align:start position:0%
wiggle room there
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
um when you're talking about what can be
 
00:41:43.630 --> 00:41:43.640 align:start position:0%
moved around in a flexible way
 
00:41:46.849 --> 00:41:46.859 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
um so that 124 where does that show up
 
00:41:52.670 --> 00:41:52.680 align:start position:0%
in the budget book I I believe that
 
00:41:54.950 --> 00:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
number is most likely from the agency
 
00:41:58.970 --> 00:41:58.980 align:start position:0%
phase so if you turn to page 1014 thank
 
00:42:01.190 --> 00:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
you the governor's recommended 24 it's
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
130 million then uh State fiscal year 25
 
00:42:07.430 --> 00:42:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's 130 million as well
 
00:42:09.530 --> 00:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
um what you're going to see there is the
 
00:42:12.050 --> 00:42:12.060 align:start position:0%
primarily the increase from the public
 
00:42:14.630 --> 00:42:14.640 align:start position:0%
health infrastructure grant that Trisha
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
was just referring to it's about it's
 
00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:18.240 align:start position:0%
about five million dollars and that was
 
00:42:20.089 --> 00:42:20.099 align:start position:0%
added during the governor's phase so so
 
00:42:21.770 --> 00:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
that's the that's the one discrepancy
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
there thank you thank you Nathan of
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
course that's good that we have someone
 
00:42:27.589 --> 00:42:27.599 align:start position:0%
who does the math we have we have more
 
00:42:29.630 --> 00:42:29.640 align:start position:0%
representative Waller
 
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you I just was wondering about the
 
00:42:35.089 --> 00:42:35.099 align:start position:0%
15 of General funds are most of those
 
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
used for matching
 
00:42:39.230 --> 00:42:39.240 align:start position:0%
many of them are used for matching and
 
00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
then a handful you know some of them are
 
00:42:42.410 --> 00:42:42.420 align:start position:0%
also used for things like food
 
00:42:44.210 --> 00:42:44.220 align:start position:0%
protection you know stuff where we don't
 
00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
have federal funds to support that food
 
00:42:49.310 --> 00:42:49.320 align:start position:0%
protection is a mix of fees and then the
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
rest is General funds because in statute
 
00:42:53.089 --> 00:42:53.099 align:start position:0%
we're only allowed to keep three hundred
 
00:42:55.130 --> 00:42:55.140 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of our fees like our
 
00:42:57.230 --> 00:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
licensure fees and then everything else
 
00:42:58.910 --> 00:42:58.920 align:start position:0%
for the program has to be funded through
 
00:43:01.609 --> 00:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:03.829 --> 00:43:03.839 align:start position:0%
um we have a breadth of our we got more
 
00:43:03.839 --> 00:43:05.690 align:start position:0%
um we have a breadth of our we got more
representative

00:43:05.690 --> 00:43:05.700 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:43:06.950 --> 00:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
since the word matching came up I know
 
00:43:10.550 --> 00:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
this is not specific to you but it's a
 
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.180 align:start position:0%
question I've hadn't I'm hoping that you
 
00:43:14.089 --> 00:43:14.099 align:start position:0%
can answer it with regard to the 3.1
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
percent across the board uh rate
 
00:43:15.599 --> 00:43:16.670 align:start position:0%
percent across the board uh rate
increase

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
increase
 
00:43:17.930 --> 00:43:17.940 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
a generally matched like 50 50 in those
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
compartments where it's 50 50 and
 
00:43:22.670 --> 00:43:22.680 align:start position:0%
whatever the match may be in other
 
00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:24.170 align:start position:0%
whatever the match may be in other
places

00:43:24.170 --> 00:43:24.180 align:start position:0%
places
 
00:43:27.710 --> 00:43:27.720 align:start position:0%
sure so so the the 3.1 percent that we
 
00:43:29.329 --> 00:43:29.339 align:start position:0%
were talking about yesterday that that's
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
that's Medicaid and and you won't you
 
00:43:33.290 --> 00:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
won't really see that show up in in the
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
public health budget here today
 
00:43:37.670 --> 00:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
I understand that but do you understand
 
00:43:39.430 --> 00:43:39.440 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
that is that federally matched when we
 
00:43:46.790 --> 00:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
do that increase yes so so what um what
 
00:43:48.770 --> 00:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
what you see like in the in the Surplus
 
00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:49.970 align:start position:0%
what you see like in the in the Surplus
document

00:43:49.970 --> 00:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
document
 
00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
um with the hp2 provision for the 17
 
00:43:53.690 --> 00:43:53.700 align:start position:0%
million dollars of General funds there
 
00:43:57.410 --> 00:43:57.420 align:start position:0%
will be a a match of of federal dollars
 
00:43:59.930 --> 00:43:59.940 align:start position:0%
um now it primarily like if we're
 
00:44:02.750 --> 00:44:02.760 align:start position:0%
thinking standard Medicaid that's 50 50
 
00:44:05.270 --> 00:44:05.280 align:start position:0%
um if it's Chip it's 65.35 so there are
 
00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:07.440 align:start position:0%
some nuances there but yes primarily 50
 
00:44:09.290 --> 00:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
50. okay thank you
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:16.550 --> 00:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
representative hold thank you chairman
 
00:44:21.349 --> 00:44:21.359 align:start position:0%
so um on page one 1014 thank you Nathan
 
00:44:24.650 --> 00:44:24.660 align:start position:0%
um so is this a mandated
 
00:44:28.609 --> 00:44:28.619 align:start position:0%
um 15 85 sharing by federal government
 
00:44:33.730 --> 00:44:33.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
so there there's a variety of factors
 
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.030 align:start position:0%
so there there's a variety of factors
but

00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:44:41.210 --> 00:44:41.220 align:start position:0%
um we we cost allocate many of our
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
positions and um if if position is cost
 
00:44:46.430 --> 00:44:46.440 align:start position:0%
allocated you know there there we need
 
00:44:50.809 --> 00:44:50.819 align:start position:0%
to be able to attribute a specific cost
 
00:44:52.609 --> 00:44:52.619 align:start position:0%
of the federal portion to the activity
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
that that individual is doing and
 
00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
oftentimes you know an individual could
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
be working on a variety of different
 
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
federal grants but then there's a
 
00:45:01.609 --> 00:45:01.619 align:start position:0%
portion of their work that that would
 
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
not qualify
 
00:45:06.530 --> 00:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
um for for that for that cost allocation
 
00:45:09.530 --> 00:45:09.540 align:start position:0%
so this isn't this is not necessarily a
 
00:45:13.010 --> 00:45:13.020 align:start position:0%
statutory match this is just where it is
 
00:45:13.020 --> 00:45:14.270 align:start position:0%
statutory match this is just where it is
right

00:45:14.270 --> 00:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:45:17.829 --> 00:45:17.839 align:start position:0%
with with so Public Health receives
 
00:45:20.390 --> 00:45:20.400 align:start position:0%
hundreds of of federal grants and with
 
00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
every Federal grant there are specific
 
00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:23.690 align:start position:0%
every Federal grant there are specific
requirements

00:45:23.690 --> 00:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
00:45:25.849 --> 00:45:25.859 align:start position:0%
um so there may be maintenance of effort
 
00:45:27.290 --> 00:45:27.300 align:start position:0%
requirements within each one of those
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
grants so that we would have to put
 
00:45:30.650 --> 00:45:30.660 align:start position:0%
forward a certain amount of General
 
00:45:33.770 --> 00:45:33.780 align:start position:0%
funds towards that particular grant us
 
00:45:36.290 --> 00:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
many are a hundred percent but some are
 
00:45:38.750 --> 00:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
not it just depends upon the grant I
 
00:45:41.089 --> 00:45:41.099 align:start position:0%
think yes yeah I would just underscore
 
00:45:43.370 --> 00:45:43.380 align:start position:0%
that it really is Grant by Grant Federal
 
00:45:45.589 --> 00:45:45.599 align:start position:0%
Source by federal Source account by
 
00:45:48.230 --> 00:45:48.240 align:start position:0%
account of where you'll see
 
00:45:50.210 --> 00:45:50.220 align:start position:0%
um to represent walner also spoken this
 
00:45:51.290 --> 00:45:51.300 align:start position:0%
there are going to be places where you
 
00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:53.220 align:start position:0%
see you know I don't know if a lot of
 
00:45:54.950 --> 00:45:54.960 align:start position:0%
General funds but more General funds
 
00:45:57.650 --> 00:45:57.660 align:start position:0%
lots of places you'll see Zero and and
 
00:46:00.050 --> 00:46:00.060 align:start position:0%
that's part of the reason that we have
 
00:46:02.329 --> 00:46:02.339 align:start position:0%
so many accounts here so that we can
 
00:46:04.010 --> 00:46:04.020 align:start position:0%
account for each one of those funding
 
00:46:05.690 --> 00:46:05.700 align:start position:0%
sources separately to try to make it
 
00:46:07.730 --> 00:46:07.740 align:start position:0%
clear transparent and much easier to
 
00:46:11.150 --> 00:46:11.160 align:start position:0%
manage yes yes there is there is method
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
to that Madness of all of the accounts
 
00:46:14.569 --> 00:46:14.579 align:start position:0%
especially with the federal grants that
 
00:46:17.150 --> 00:46:17.160 align:start position:0%
come and go we have some grants you'll
 
00:46:18.290 --> 00:46:18.300 align:start position:0%
hear we're going to talk about the
 
00:46:20.329 --> 00:46:20.339 align:start position:0%
maternal and child health block grant we
 
00:46:22.130 --> 00:46:22.140 align:start position:0%
we have had maternal and Child Health
 
00:46:24.230 --> 00:46:24.240 align:start position:0%
Grants since Federal uh since President
 
00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:25.730 align:start position:0%
Grants since Federal uh since President
Roosevelt

00:46:25.730 --> 00:46:25.740 align:start position:0%
Roosevelt
 
00:46:28.010 --> 00:46:28.020 align:start position:0%
um you know that's a long time that's a
 
00:46:30.230 --> 00:46:30.240 align:start position:0%
pretty stable set of money
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
um and then we have other grants that
 
00:46:34.550 --> 00:46:34.560 align:start position:0%
change every three years and so managing
 
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
that is just uh part of the
 
00:46:39.290 --> 00:46:39.300 align:start position:0%
administrative work of Public Health
 
00:46:42.170 --> 00:46:42.180 align:start position:0%
I want to do a time check we've got like
 
00:46:44.750 --> 00:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
45 minutes in and we've gone through
 
00:46:48.530 --> 00:46:48.540 align:start position:0%
just under 10 a fourth of your slides so
 
00:46:50.210 --> 00:46:50.220 align:start position:0%
I know we're you're stopping for
 
00:46:54.050 --> 00:46:54.060 align:start position:0%
questions uh that's on us but do you do
 
00:46:57.829 --> 00:46:57.839 align:start position:0%
you imagine the the pace to naturally be
 
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
faster than this uh in the next slides I
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
I would assume that the pace is going to
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
pick up um but it will be dependent on
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
the questions that you have right all
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
right okay
 
00:47:09.530 --> 00:47:09.540 align:start position:0%
just refer them to the page numbers
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
great so
 
00:47:13.609 --> 00:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
um and finally just the last thing I
 
00:47:16.370 --> 00:47:16.380 align:start position:0%
want to point out on that slide 10 is
 
00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:17.569 align:start position:0%
want to point out on that slide 10 is
really

00:47:17.569 --> 00:47:17.579 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:20.280 align:start position:0%
um that the budget does two big things
 
00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:22.619 align:start position:0%
it maintains our core infrastructure
 
00:47:25.730 --> 00:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
things that we just have to do it is in
 
00:47:28.130 --> 00:47:28.140 align:start position:0%
statute I think I shared the last time
 
00:47:30.050 --> 00:47:30.060 align:start position:0%
we met a little booklet of all of our
 
00:47:32.809 --> 00:47:32.819 align:start position:0%
statutory responsibilities so we do that
 
00:47:34.990 --> 00:47:35.000 align:start position:0%
you know we're always going to have to
 
00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:37.260 align:start position:0%
inspect milk we're always going to have
 
00:47:39.950 --> 00:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
to check for rabies and then it also
 
00:47:41.450 --> 00:47:41.460 align:start position:0%
includes a lot of these Federal
 
00:47:43.730 --> 00:47:43.740 align:start position:0%
priorities that sort of come and go at
 
00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
Scopes that expand and contract so
 
00:47:47.809 --> 00:47:47.819 align:start position:0%
that's the part of the budget that again
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
is sort of the magic of Public Health
 
00:47:51.290 --> 00:47:51.300 align:start position:0%
um and then the other thing if you're
 
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
trying to match up Staffing we use a mix
 
00:47:58.910 --> 00:47:58.920 align:start position:0%
of temporary and permanent FTE so many
 
00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
especially uh over the past I would say
 
00:48:03.650 --> 00:48:03.660 align:start position:0%
the past four years or so or the past
 
00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
two bienniums we have moved more to
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
using 8T and 9 90 positions which are
 
00:48:11.750 --> 00:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
State temporary positions these aren't
 
00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
you know contracted these are State
 
00:48:15.890 --> 00:48:15.900 align:start position:0%
positions but they are associated with a
 
00:48:18.290 --> 00:48:18.300 align:start position:0%
particular Grant but it's not a it's not
 
00:48:21.170 --> 00:48:21.180 align:start position:0%
considered a permanent FTE so sometimes
 
00:48:22.730 --> 00:48:22.740 align:start position:0%
you'll hear me say you know over the
 
00:48:23.809 --> 00:48:23.819 align:start position:0%
course you've heard me say I've got
 
00:48:25.849 --> 00:48:25.859 align:start position:0%
almost 400 staff but it only looks like
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
250. it's because of the the temporary
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
staff and the way that we count staff in
 
00:48:33.290 --> 00:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
the state budget is that fair all right
 
00:48:35.809 --> 00:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
so let's move into 11 this is where the
 
00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220 align:start position:0%
pace begins to pick up this is our first
 
00:48:39.890 --> 00:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
set of budgets it's the office of the
 
00:48:41.690 --> 00:48:41.700 align:start position:0%
director that's me and just a handful of
 
00:48:43.849 --> 00:48:43.859 align:start position:0%
other people but it's also where we
 
00:48:45.410 --> 00:48:45.420 align:start position:0%
administer the rent and the
 
00:48:47.750 --> 00:48:47.760 align:start position:0%
administrative work of the division it's
 
00:48:50.210 --> 00:48:50.220 align:start position:0%
cost allocated from Grants and generally
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
funded staff and it's on page 939 of the
 
00:48:55.790 --> 00:48:55.800 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget uh thank
 
00:48:59.870 --> 00:48:59.880 align:start position:0%
you is this in which of your bubbles uh
 
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
do you have the communications role the
 
00:49:07.069 --> 00:49:07.079 align:start position:0%
one that helps draft any public health
 
00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:11.280 align:start position:0%
notices does that in your group or no we
 
00:49:13.609 --> 00:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
currently and I'll get to that currently
 
00:49:16.550 --> 00:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
we do that with um a lot of our
 
00:49:17.809 --> 00:49:17.819 align:start position:0%
emergency Public Health Emergency
 
00:49:20.750 --> 00:49:20.760 align:start position:0%
dollars that is where what funds are Pio
 
00:49:22.670 --> 00:49:22.680 align:start position:0%
or press information officer that works
 
00:49:25.550 --> 00:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
under Jake Leon but famously we have
 
00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:27.240 align:start position:0%
this new Public Health infrastructure
 
00:49:29.690 --> 00:49:29.700 align:start position:0%
grant that creates a new Communications
 
00:49:31.790 --> 00:49:31.800 align:start position:0%
person that's going to sit in the office
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
of the director
 
00:49:35.710 --> 00:49:35.720 align:start position:0%
and that's going to be a higher level
 
00:49:38.210 --> 00:49:38.220 align:start position:0%
strategic position to help us with
 
00:49:40.490 --> 00:49:40.500 align:start position:0%
Communications so you know again I've
 
00:49:44.030 --> 00:49:44.040 align:start position:0%
got a staff of hundreds of phds and um
 
00:49:46.309 --> 00:49:46.319 align:start position:0%
super smart people sometimes they like
 
00:49:48.290 --> 00:49:48.300 align:start position:0%
to talk to each other or at a certain
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
level and I we've recognized that we
 
00:49:52.370 --> 00:49:52.380 align:start position:0%
need to do a better job of communicating
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
with the public and communicating with
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
our with our policy makers
 
00:49:59.450 --> 00:49:59.460 align:start position:0%
great so um we can jump into our first
 
00:50:02.329 --> 00:50:02.339 align:start position:0%
Bureau which is on slide 12. this is
 
00:50:05.150 --> 00:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
informatics and health statistics it has
 
00:50:07.430 --> 00:50:07.440 align:start position:0%
a number of smaller grants some of our
 
00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:09.300 align:start position:0%
surveys things like behavioral risk
 
00:50:12.230 --> 00:50:12.240 align:start position:0%
factor survey it has our we have moved
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
our cancer registry back into this
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
particular group it had been in our
 
00:50:19.010 --> 00:50:19.020 align:start position:0%
cancer program we think it fits better
 
00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
in with a lot of the other data
 
00:50:24.829 --> 00:50:24.839 align:start position:0%
so because there's not a lot of money
 
00:50:28.190 --> 00:50:28.200 align:start position:0%
for technology in here relative to the
 
00:50:30.349 --> 00:50:30.359 align:start position:0%
amount of informatics work that could be
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
done in your area I assume that most of
 
00:50:36.890 --> 00:50:36.900 align:start position:0%
the money to to support the informatics
 
00:50:39.829 --> 00:50:39.839 align:start position:0%
function is over in Mr weeder's budget
 
00:50:39.839 --> 00:50:41.270 align:start position:0%
function is over in Mr weeder's budget
somewhere

00:50:41.270 --> 00:50:41.280 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:45.420 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct okay so there there
 
00:50:48.349 --> 00:50:48.359 align:start position:0%
are ten positions in here of of these
 
00:50:48.359 --> 00:50:49.910 align:start position:0%
are ten positions in here of of these
ten

00:50:49.910 --> 00:50:49.920 align:start position:0%
ten
 
00:50:52.309 --> 00:50:52.319 align:start position:0%
um could you give us a sense of what
 
00:50:54.910 --> 00:50:54.920 align:start position:0%
their skill sets are then are they
 
00:50:57.290 --> 00:50:57.300 align:start position:0%
informaticists are they data entry
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
people are they you know what are who
 
00:51:02.089 --> 00:51:02.099 align:start position:0%
are these 10 people sure so it's it's a
 
00:51:04.609 --> 00:51:04.619 align:start position:0%
mix um there's again just a handful of
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
them we have informaticists in there so
 
00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:08.579 align:start position:0%
folks that are really working looking at
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
the software and the hardware and making
 
00:51:12.410 --> 00:51:12.420 align:start position:0%
the data flow from one place to another
 
00:51:14.650 --> 00:51:14.660 align:start position:0%
we also have a set of Health
 
00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:17.880 align:start position:0%
statisticians that are making sure that
 
00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:21.300 align:start position:0%
um our analyzes are correct we also have
 
00:51:25.250 --> 00:51:25.260 align:start position:0%
a number of these folks work on our DHHS
 
00:51:27.650 --> 00:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
data portal so again matching those two
 
00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:29.400 align:start position:0%
things making sure the analysis is
 
00:51:31.190 --> 00:51:31.200 align:start position:0%
correct making sure the informatics is
 
00:51:32.630 --> 00:51:32.640 align:start position:0%
correct so that it looks pretty in
 
00:51:35.630 --> 00:51:35.640 align:start position:0%
Tableau when you open up your website so
 
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
one of the themes I've been asking about
 
00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:40.140 align:start position:0%
this cycle is the extent to which we
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
have a mature data warehouse strategy
 
00:51:46.250 --> 00:51:46.260 align:start position:0%
and that we have the right tools that
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
are used commonly to do the uh sort of
 
00:51:53.510 --> 00:51:53.520 align:start position:0%
the the front end queries into the
 
00:51:56.390 --> 00:51:56.400 align:start position:0%
system uh do you do you do you know your
 
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
technology well enough in this area to
 
00:52:01.089 --> 00:52:01.099 align:start position:0%
know if you're leveraging a common
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
platforming system or if you're doing
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
your own thing here no we are certainly
 
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
using the ebi the Enterprise business
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
yeah until whatever I intelligence I
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
always forget the eye but yes the ebi is
 
00:52:14.750 --> 00:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
at the core of what of men much of what
 
00:52:18.770 --> 00:52:18.780 align:start position:0%
we do we also have a system of Legacy
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
programs however uh that are
 
00:52:23.089 --> 00:52:23.099 align:start position:0%
programmatic in
 
00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:24.900 align:start position:0%
um and may have to do with all of those
 
00:52:27.530 --> 00:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
stove types of funding so a lead program
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
and you know cancer registry is a great
 
00:52:32.990 --> 00:52:33.000 align:start position:0%
example it that doesn't particularly use
 
00:52:35.569 --> 00:52:35.579 align:start position:0%
the ebi because it is sort of stood up
 
00:52:38.690 --> 00:52:38.700 align:start position:0%
you know in a separate system so but the
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
degree to which we can leverage that
 
00:52:44.809 --> 00:52:44.819 align:start position:0%
back end is where we've been going is
 
00:52:47.030 --> 00:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
our chief of health statistics and
 
00:52:49.069 --> 00:52:49.079 align:start position:0%
informatics she probably spends half of
 
00:52:50.809 --> 00:52:50.819 align:start position:0%
every day with Dave Wieters in some
 
00:52:53.089 --> 00:52:53.099 align:start position:0%
capacity to ensure that as a department
 
00:52:55.549 --> 00:52:55.559 align:start position:0%
we're working together yeah I know her
 
00:52:58.250 --> 00:52:58.260 align:start position:0%
through the vital records function so
 
00:53:00.530 --> 00:53:00.540 align:start position:0%
they're representative
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:53:04.069 --> 00:53:04.079 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm just catching up I'm on page
 
00:53:05.750 --> 00:53:05.760 align:start position:0%
940 still
 
00:53:09.170 --> 00:53:09.180 align:start position:0%
um looking at lines 28
 
00:53:12.290 --> 00:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
and then indirect costs from the last
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
biennium going forward roughly there was
 
00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:16.380 align:start position:0%
eight billion sorry eight million
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
dollars spent in the department of which
 
00:53:21.109 --> 00:53:21.119 align:start position:0%
2 million was in direct cost that two
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
million goes away leaving us about six
 
00:53:26.329 --> 00:53:26.339 align:start position:0%
yet this year's operating cost is almost
 
00:53:29.690 --> 00:53:29.700 align:start position:0%
seven and it predominantly shows up in
 
00:53:32.089 --> 00:53:32.099 align:start position:0%
transfers to plant and property almost a
 
00:53:35.569 --> 00:53:35.579 align:start position:0%
million dollars more sure so I'll answer
 
00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:37.800 align:start position:0%
the easy one first so the indirect cost
 
00:53:39.829 --> 00:53:39.839 align:start position:0%
line um that was centralized to account
 
00:53:42.290 --> 00:53:42.300 align:start position:0%
9 500 uh within the office of the
 
00:53:44.569 --> 00:53:44.579 align:start position:0%
commissioner the transfers to plant and
 
00:53:45.770 --> 00:53:45.780 align:start position:0%
property so the department of
 
00:53:48.309 --> 00:53:48.319 align:start position:0%
administrative Services charges us rent
 
00:53:51.650 --> 00:53:51.660 align:start position:0%
for the property at Hazen drive and they
 
00:53:53.390 --> 00:53:53.400 align:start position:0%
determine a square footage rate and they
 
00:53:55.790 --> 00:53:55.800 align:start position:0%
provide us that figure and then we pay
 
00:53:57.230 --> 00:53:57.240 align:start position:0%
them and we don't really have too much
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
negotiating room there so that's a
 
00:54:01.730 --> 00:54:01.740 align:start position:0%
that's roughly a 25 increase is that
 
00:54:06.170 --> 00:54:06.180 align:start position:0%
going to be across all right so
 
00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.609 align:start position:0%
going to be across all right so
so

00:54:07.609 --> 00:54:07.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:54:10.609 --> 00:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
um the facilities that will be coming
 
00:54:14.870 --> 00:54:14.880 align:start position:0%
here I believe next Maybe
 
00:54:17.510 --> 00:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
next Friday to present um we're going to
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
be talking about the other half that
 
00:54:21.290 --> 00:54:21.300 align:start position:0%
that Das charges us as well that shows
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
up in the facilities budget but this
 
00:54:26.870 --> 00:54:26.880 align:start position:0%
here this is limited to Hazen drive so
 
00:54:28.670 --> 00:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
just Hazen Drive does it also include
 
00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:38.349 --> 00:54:38.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:40.730 --> 00:54:40.740 align:start position:0%
when you come next time maybe you're not
 
00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:42.660 align:start position:0%
prepared today right because
 
00:54:44.450 --> 00:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
drilling down at this level can you get
 
00:54:46.190 --> 00:54:46.200 align:start position:0%
dollars per square foot that's just
 
00:54:48.710 --> 00:54:48.720 align:start position:0%
right what is what is the facility what
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
is the total square footage of haze and
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
drive and what are we paying per square
 
00:54:54.470 --> 00:54:54.480 align:start position:0%
foot for that a 25 increase seems
 
00:54:56.930 --> 00:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
significant I I would agree and I can
 
00:54:58.790 --> 00:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
absolutely do that
 
00:55:00.589 --> 00:55:00.599 align:start position:0%
I think there's a phrase that says the
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
rent is too darn High
 
00:55:05.630 --> 00:55:05.640 align:start position:0%
okay representative Stringham for a
 
00:55:08.030 --> 00:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
question uh just follow up on that did I
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
also hear you uh say that um that the
 
00:55:11.460 --> 00:55:12.829 align:start position:0%
also hear you uh say that um that the
administrative

00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
administrative
 
00:55:17.329 --> 00:55:17.339 align:start position:0%
um uh 5110 account is then allocated to
 
00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
specific grants so uh if you're um the
 
00:55:24.770 --> 00:55:24.780 align:start position:0%
rent you're paying is higher you have
 
00:55:24.780 --> 00:55:26.390 align:start position:0%
rent you're paying is higher you have
more

00:55:26.390 --> 00:55:26.400 align:start position:0%
more
 
00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:26.990 align:start position:0%
more
um

00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:29.510 --> 00:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
costs that can be allocated to specific
 
00:55:32.870 --> 00:55:32.880 align:start position:0%
grants which may be uh reimbursed under
 
00:55:35.450 --> 00:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
those federal federal grants is that
 
00:55:35.460 --> 00:55:40.430 align:start position:0%
those federal federal grants is that
accurate

00:55:40.430 --> 00:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:42.349 --> 00:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
I would I would have to follow up on on
 
00:55:44.990 --> 00:55:45.000 align:start position:0%
that question uh I
 
00:55:48.170 --> 00:55:48.180 align:start position:0%
is there an easy answer yes yes we would
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:53.930 --> 00:55:53.940 align:start position:0%
follow up uh yeah yes we would be able
 
00:55:56.150 --> 00:55:56.160 align:start position:0%
to better leverage federal dollars to
 
00:55:58.609 --> 00:55:58.619 align:start position:0%
address that the only thing I would add
 
00:56:00.410 --> 00:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
is our federal dollars are pretty static
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
so again we use those funds what it
 
00:56:05.870 --> 00:56:05.880 align:start position:0%
means you know as those allocated costs
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
increase even things like salaries
 
00:56:10.549 --> 00:56:10.559 align:start position:0%
increase or rent increases it just means
 
00:56:12.049 --> 00:56:12.059 align:start position:0%
that we have fewer dollars to actually
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
put out into Community to do the work so
 
00:56:16.730 --> 00:56:16.740 align:start position:0%
you know that and what we'll see as you
 
00:56:18.650 --> 00:56:18.660 align:start position:0%
go through these we have many federal
 
00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
grants that are you know less than two
 
00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:22.740 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars a year and then
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
we have some that are bigger that are
 
00:56:26.329 --> 00:56:26.339 align:start position:0%
several million but especially on those
 
00:56:28.609 --> 00:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
tiny grants on the you know grants that
 
00:56:31.010 --> 00:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
are less than 200 000
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
um all of the allocated costs really
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
start squeezing in into it and don't
 
00:56:38.270 --> 00:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
allow us to do necessarily the work that
 
00:56:40.309 --> 00:56:40.319 align:start position:0%
is intended to be done
 
00:56:42.670 --> 00:56:42.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative oh all set
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
representative norgren per question
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
thank you very much sorry to be late
 
00:56:49.250 --> 00:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
crash on 89.
 
00:56:49.260 --> 00:56:54.349 align:start position:0%
crash on 89.
um

00:56:54.349 --> 00:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
40 indirect costs that's zeroed out for
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 cute yes so the indirect costs
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
were centralized within account 9 500
 
00:57:07.609 --> 00:57:07.619 align:start position:0%
within the office of the commissioner so
 
00:57:09.589 --> 00:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
so we move those expenses to one Central
 
00:57:11.990 --> 00:57:12.000 align:start position:0%
account from multiple areas in one place
 
00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.670 align:start position:0%
account from multiple areas in one place
yes

00:57:13.670 --> 00:57:13.680 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:15.650 --> 00:57:15.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
00:57:18.650 --> 00:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
great Nathan where is that which page do
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:37.790 --> 00:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
it's on page 1069 of the governor's
 
00:57:41.210 --> 00:57:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.490 --> 00:57:43.500 align:start position:0%
excellent please continue Ms Kelly thank
 
00:57:45.589 --> 00:57:45.599 align:start position:0%
you so much so on slide 13 this is just
 
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
another one of these Graphics that we
 
00:57:48.650 --> 00:57:48.660 align:start position:0%
shared with you the last time I was with
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
you to talk about sort of data
 
00:57:52.309 --> 00:57:52.319 align:start position:0%
modernization and public health
 
00:57:54.109 --> 00:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and this just underscores
 
00:57:55.790 --> 00:57:55.800 align:start position:0%
that we've been able to use some of our
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
covid funding again coveted funding
 
00:57:59.630 --> 00:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't show up in here but we've been
 
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
able to use coveted funding and other
 
00:58:03.290 --> 00:58:03.300 align:start position:0%
funds to really start thinking about
 
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
public health infrastructure in here
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
you'll also see
 
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
um at the end in the governor's phase we
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
added this grant that's called the
 
00:58:13.730 --> 00:58:13.740 align:start position:0%
public health infrastructure Grant it is
 
00:58:16.010 --> 00:58:16.020 align:start position:0%
new it has not come to fiscal yet so we
 
00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't have the full details it's been
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
awarded to us we're still negotiating
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
the budget line items with CDC but
 
00:58:24.650 --> 00:58:24.660 align:start position:0%
fiscal will see that and will be able to
 
00:58:26.569 --> 00:58:26.579 align:start position:0%
provide some more detail but I can tell
 
00:58:28.490 --> 00:58:28.500 align:start position:0%
you at a very high end that public
 
00:58:30.170 --> 00:58:30.180 align:start position:0%
health infrastructure and data
 
00:58:31.730 --> 00:58:31.740 align:start position:0%
modernization Grant is going to help us
 
00:58:33.890 --> 00:58:33.900 align:start position:0%
with things like cancer epidemiology
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
that's an area where we just haven't you
 
00:58:37.730 --> 00:58:37.740 align:start position:0%
know our cancer program keeps sort of
 
00:58:39.589 --> 00:58:39.599 align:start position:0%
getting smaller and smaller and our
 
00:58:42.170 --> 00:58:42.180 align:start position:0%
needs for understanding cancer incidents
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
is growing so we're being able to use
 
00:58:46.549 --> 00:58:46.559 align:start position:0%
the infrastructure grant to get the kind
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
of epidemiology support that we need to
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
be able to do future work
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
um and you know so the other piece too
 
00:58:59.750 --> 00:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
on slide 14 is just a screenshot not
 
00:59:01.609 --> 00:59:01.619 align:start position:0%
from our covid website it looks like our
 
00:59:03.589 --> 00:59:03.599 align:start position:0%
covid website but it's not this is
 
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
actually our opioid dashboard that we
 
00:59:09.410 --> 00:59:09.420 align:start position:0%
have on our DHHS data system and this is
 
00:59:12.589 --> 00:59:12.599 align:start position:0%
a place where we've leveraged funds from
 
00:59:14.630 --> 00:59:14.640 align:start position:0%
something called opioid data to action
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
grant that sits in another Bureau but a
 
00:59:19.089 --> 00:59:19.099 align:start position:0%
chunk of the money comes and sits over
 
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
is utilized by informatics in order to
 
00:59:25.490 --> 00:59:25.500 align:start position:0%
create this Tableau Data dashboard
 
00:59:29.329 --> 00:59:29.339 align:start position:0%
that's available online as well as to
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
help support things like our
 
00:59:33.230 --> 00:59:33.240 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring program to
 
00:59:35.390 --> 00:59:35.400 align:start position:0%
have the data support that they need to
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
be able to present the data to look at
 
00:59:39.890 --> 00:59:39.900 align:start position:0%
prescription opioid prescription data
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
over time so it's just an example of the
 
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
way we we sort of take all the uh those
 
00:59:46.970 --> 00:59:46.980 align:start position:0%
stove types and try to blend them to the
 
00:59:49.130 --> 00:59:49.140 align:start position:0%
best of our ability we don't rigidly
 
00:59:51.829 --> 00:59:51.839 align:start position:0%
stay within each lane but we it we're
 
00:59:53.870 --> 00:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
not always able to be as flexible as we
 
00:59:56.569 --> 00:59:56.579 align:start position:0%
want to but when we can we try and braid
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
them across areas
 
01:00:01.069 --> 01:00:01.079 align:start position:0%
so on slide 15 we jump into the Health
 
01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:04.740 align:start position:0%
Access equity and policy Bureau again
 
01:00:07.190 --> 01:00:07.200 align:start position:0%
relatively small Bureau relatively small
 
01:00:09.890 --> 01:00:09.900 align:start position:0%
numbers of of Grants
 
01:00:12.890 --> 01:00:12.900 align:start position:0%
um we uh as I noted this is where some
 
01:00:15.470 --> 01:00:15.480 align:start position:0%
of our sometimes we affectionately call
 
01:00:17.630 --> 01:00:17.640 align:start position:0%
this The Island of Misfit Toys we have
 
01:00:19.069 --> 01:00:19.079 align:start position:0%
things like our prescription drug
 
01:00:20.750 --> 01:00:20.760 align:start position:0%
monitoring program our cannabis program
 
01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:23.220 align:start position:0%
as well as our rural health and Primary
 
01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:25.740 align:start position:0%
Care programs and I'm happy to answer
 
01:00:30.650 --> 01:00:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.530 --> 01:00:33.540 align:start position:0%
all right representative Mooney
 
01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you if you don't mind I'd like to
 
01:00:38.030 --> 01:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
go to the cancer registry just a bit I
 
01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:40.380 align:start position:0%
see that was on your previous slides
 
01:00:43.609 --> 01:00:43.619 align:start position:0%
there is a bill forthcoming related to
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
Merrimack House Bill 614 that's right
 
01:00:51.650 --> 01:00:51.660 align:start position:0%
and the question is is that money in
 
01:00:52.809 --> 01:00:52.819 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
01:00:55.309 --> 01:00:55.319 align:start position:0%
contained in the budget we're looking at
 
01:00:58.130 --> 01:00:58.140 align:start position:0%
no it is not but it would be support it
 
01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
would enable us to do um so 6 14 is a
 
01:01:04.670 --> 01:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
bill that would like us to take a look
 
01:01:07.190 --> 01:01:07.200 align:start position:0%
at a feasibility study to understand
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
whether or not we need to open up an
 
01:01:11.270 --> 01:01:11.280 align:start position:0%
entire case you know do some real
 
01:01:13.970 --> 01:01:13.980 align:start position:0%
in-depth case uh understanding of what's
 
01:01:16.490 --> 01:01:16.500 align:start position:0%
going on in the excess cases of kidney
 
01:01:18.950 --> 01:01:18.960 align:start position:0%
cancer in Merrimack so the funding
 
01:01:21.170 --> 01:01:21.180 align:start position:0%
that's here is simply to maintain the
 
01:01:23.390 --> 01:01:23.400 align:start position:0%
cancer registry and to have a little bit
 
01:01:26.030 --> 01:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
of you know the we we contract with
 
01:01:27.890 --> 01:01:27.900 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth the support that it takes just
 
01:01:30.049 --> 01:01:30.059 align:start position:0%
to do the cancer registry
 
01:01:33.109 --> 01:01:33.119 align:start position:0%
um and so the 614 would be additive to
 
01:01:35.329 --> 01:01:35.339 align:start position:0%
that but it would use the data of the
 
01:01:36.770 --> 01:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
cancer registry
 
01:01:39.589 --> 01:01:39.599 align:start position:0%
okay uh thank you next question is with
 
01:01:41.809 --> 01:01:41.819 align:start position:0%
regards to that cancer registry how many
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
communities benefit from that particular
 
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
section of the budget would you say
 
01:01:48.950 --> 01:01:48.960 align:start position:0%
every community in the state of New
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire people with cancer it
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
represents the data for our people all
 
01:01:55.010 --> 01:01:55.020 align:start position:0%
people with cancer in the state thank
 
01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:58.390 align:start position:0%
people with cancer in the state thank
you

01:01:58.390 --> 01:01:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:01.250 --> 01:02:01.260 align:start position:0%
representative Holt sorry chairman we're
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
probably destroying your timeline
 
01:02:05.930 --> 01:02:05.940 align:start position:0%
um on page 15 therapeutic cannabis
 
01:02:05.940 --> 01:02:07.010 align:start position:0%
um on page 15 therapeutic cannabis
program

01:02:07.010 --> 01:02:07.020 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:02:09.289 --> 01:02:09.299 align:start position:0%
but as we start collection collecting
 
01:02:12.109 --> 01:02:12.119 align:start position:0%
this data what happens to the list of
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
individuals that participate in that
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
program what um so thank you so that is
 
01:02:21.049 --> 01:02:21.059 align:start position:0%
uh confidential data so we keep it it is
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
separate unlike
 
01:02:24.650 --> 01:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
um we were talking about the ebi before
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
where we try and use data across systems
 
01:02:28.970 --> 01:02:28.980 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program is
 
01:02:31.010 --> 01:02:31.020 align:start position:0%
completely separate in part because it
 
01:02:33.470 --> 01:02:33.480 align:start position:0%
is still federally illegal and so that
 
01:02:36.470 --> 01:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
is kept in its own separate box okay so
 
01:02:38.030 --> 01:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
that data isn't shared with any other
 
01:02:40.010 --> 01:02:40.020 align:start position:0%
departments internal even within the
 
01:02:42.770 --> 01:02:42.780 align:start position:0%
state yeah thank you I I would also
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
assume that they have privacy procedures
 
01:02:47.750 --> 01:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
in place before things go into the data
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
warehouse It's been scrubbed of correct
 
01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:53.780 align:start position:0%
Phi correct so they're looking at
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
anonymized data right the but the
 
01:02:58.849 --> 01:02:58.859 align:start position:0%
background data there is still Phi in
 
01:03:00.349 --> 01:03:00.359 align:start position:0%
the background usually you know in order
 
01:03:01.849 --> 01:03:01.859 align:start position:0%
to make some of those connections but
 
01:03:04.490 --> 01:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
for cannabis cannabis is in its own
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
system separate we have its own data
 
01:03:08.569 --> 01:03:08.579 align:start position:0%
system it's again one of the challenges
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
we have in public health because we
 
01:03:12.530 --> 01:03:12.540 align:start position:0%
sometimes have these one-off systems in
 
01:03:14.450 --> 01:03:14.460 align:start position:0%
this case for a very good legal reason
 
01:03:16.549 --> 01:03:16.559 align:start position:0%
oh no understand that's why I'm asking
 
01:03:18.410 --> 01:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
these questions so it is truly separate
 
01:03:22.150 --> 01:03:22.160 align:start position:0%
yes not not just another
 
01:03:25.730 --> 01:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
folder per se within another system
 
01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
right no and you know I mean we go as
 
01:03:30.410 --> 01:03:30.420 align:start position:0%
far as to even our paper records are
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
under lock and key we have something
 
01:03:33.829 --> 01:03:33.839 align:start position:0%
called the cage where we put paper
 
01:03:36.349 --> 01:03:36.359 align:start position:0%
records where it's completely separate
 
01:03:38.089 --> 01:03:38.099 align:start position:0%
and you cannot you know others cannot
 
01:03:40.609 --> 01:03:40.619 align:start position:0%
get access to it even for paper records
 
01:03:42.470 --> 01:03:42.480 align:start position:0%
and certainly not for the Cannabis
 
01:03:44.569 --> 01:03:44.579 align:start position:0%
program we have over 13 000 people that
 
01:03:45.829 --> 01:03:45.839 align:start position:0%
are currently in the candidate
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
registered in the Cannabis program
 
01:03:52.190 --> 01:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
so so to talk about the time allocation
 
01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
here one this shows tremendous fortitude
 
01:03:57.289 --> 01:03:57.299 align:start position:0%
on your part to be able to keep going
 
01:03:57.299 --> 01:03:58.609 align:start position:0%
on your part to be able to keep going
but

01:03:58.609 --> 01:03:58.619 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
um I I was thinking that if we could
 
01:04:02.870 --> 01:04:02.880 align:start position:0%
basically do this in a total of three
 
01:04:05.690 --> 01:04:05.700 align:start position:0%
hours that we might work through lunch
 
01:04:07.849 --> 01:04:07.859 align:start position:0%
and just let people go before the snow
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
got worse that was a possibility but I'm
 
01:04:12.109 --> 01:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
starting to feel to me like we're going
 
01:04:13.789 --> 01:04:13.799 align:start position:0%
to need to take a lunch break at some
 
01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
point and come back
 
01:04:18.109 --> 01:04:18.119 align:start position:0%
so that was to your point yesterday
 
01:04:20.750 --> 01:04:20.760 align:start position:0%
representative tolersky I'm I actually
 
01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:22.069 align:start position:0%
representative tolersky I'm I actually
remembered

01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
remembered
 
01:04:22.079 --> 01:04:23.390 align:start position:0%
remembered
so

01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
and and I I I'm gonna have
 
01:04:27.890 --> 01:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
a bunch of questions on these little
 
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
programs yes sir
 
01:04:31.730 --> 01:04:31.740 align:start position:0%
do you think we could with two hours
 
01:04:34.490 --> 01:04:34.500 align:start position:0%
remaining get to does anybody strongly
 
01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:36.299 align:start position:0%
object to trying to close finish by one
 
01:04:39.650 --> 01:04:39.660 align:start position:0%
that gets us an extra hour right
 
01:04:41.510 --> 01:04:41.520 align:start position:0%
well that was a proposal but we're the
 
01:04:43.309 --> 01:04:43.319 align:start position:0%
ones that keep asking questions I get it
 
01:04:45.410 --> 01:04:45.420 align:start position:0%
I'll try and be conscious of that but
 
01:04:48.589 --> 01:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm about to ask a bunch so so I'm
 
01:04:52.010 --> 01:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
I'm as bad as I'm probably the worst so
 
01:04:53.690 --> 01:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to tell you what my
 
01:04:57.289 --> 01:04:57.299 align:start position:0%
questions are and and just simple little
 
01:04:58.970 --> 01:04:58.980 align:start position:0%
answers if you can
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
the hospital flux program I've forgotten
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
some of the details of it other than I
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
recall that this was a pretty cool
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
program correct so if you could just
 
01:05:12.170 --> 01:05:12.180 align:start position:0%
remind us of what that is I also
 
01:05:14.950 --> 01:05:14.960 align:start position:0%
um on the therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:05:18.109 --> 01:05:18.119 align:start position:0%
the last this is my fourth term I keep
 
01:05:19.970 --> 01:05:19.980 align:start position:0%
asking the same question
 
01:05:23.630 --> 01:05:23.640 align:start position:0%
are are we at risk because of the
 
01:05:26.390 --> 01:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
competition from recreational pot of
 
01:05:28.870 --> 01:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
having our therapeutic cannabis program
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
you know cave in because the
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
alternatives are out there and cheaper
 
01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:37.319 align:start position:0%
I'm worried about the the long-term
 
01:05:40.010 --> 01:05:40.020 align:start position:0%
sustainability of that program and then
 
01:05:42.530 --> 01:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
on the prescription drug monitoring I'm
 
01:05:45.170 --> 01:05:45.180 align:start position:0%
curious what they do relative to the
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board so
 
01:05:49.789 --> 01:05:49.799 align:start position:0%
those are my three questions I'll try
 
01:05:51.230 --> 01:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
and answer those sort of in backward
 
01:05:53.089 --> 01:05:53.099 align:start position:0%
order of the prescription drug
 
01:05:54.890 --> 01:05:54.900 align:start position:0%
monitoring program is not connected to
 
01:05:56.390 --> 01:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
the prescription affordability program
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
those are two separate things
 
01:05:59.630 --> 01:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
prescription drug monitoring really is
 
01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:02.040 align:start position:0%
focused on opioids and stimulants and
 
01:06:05.270 --> 01:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
just monitoring how the how prescribers
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
and providers tap into that data to see
 
01:06:09.770 --> 01:06:09.780 align:start position:0%
what other prescriptions an individual
 
01:06:11.990 --> 01:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
has totally separate
 
01:06:14.089 --> 01:06:14.099 align:start position:0%
um the question around therapeutic
 
01:06:14.099 --> 01:06:16.789 align:start position:0%
um the question around therapeutic
cannabis

01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.589 --> 01:06:18.599 align:start position:0%
um around whether
 
01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
um recreational pot is or recreational
 
01:06:23.809 --> 01:06:23.819 align:start position:0%
Cannabis is impacting that certainly we
 
01:06:25.789 --> 01:06:25.799 align:start position:0%
believe so so our alternative treatment
 
01:06:27.049 --> 01:06:27.059 align:start position:0%
centers which are the retail
 
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
environments that do the growing
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
production selling
 
01:06:33.770 --> 01:06:33.780 align:start position:0%
um they will tell you that they are
 
01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:35.339 align:start position:0%
certainly feeling a hit
 
01:06:36.770 --> 01:06:36.780 align:start position:0%
um because their product is more
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
expensive a than the gray market and B
 
01:06:40.849 --> 01:06:40.859 align:start position:0%
what you can get in Massachusetts they
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
will also tell you and we will tell you
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
too it's probably of higher quality
 
01:06:46.549 --> 01:06:46.559 align:start position:0%
because of the testing Pro the testing
 
01:06:48.710 --> 01:06:48.720 align:start position:0%
that we have on it and the nature that
 
01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
it is for medicinal use and so there's a
 
01:06:52.730 --> 01:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
great deal of Education that goes with
 
01:06:55.309 --> 01:06:55.319 align:start position:0%
it so you would miss out you know I I
 
01:06:58.130 --> 01:06:58.140 align:start position:0%
envisioned this if you were a you know
 
01:07:02.210 --> 01:07:02.220 align:start position:0%
older than 65 years old and had cancer
 
01:07:04.250 --> 01:07:04.260 align:start position:0%
whether or not you would want to go into
 
01:07:06.650 --> 01:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
a recreational shop somewhere in Lowell
 
01:07:09.470 --> 01:07:09.480 align:start position:0%
or you would rather go into an ATC in
 
01:07:11.690 --> 01:07:11.700 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that's focused on how do
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
we per how do they provide
 
01:07:15.049 --> 01:07:15.059 align:start position:0%
um the sort of products that could help
 
01:07:16.370 --> 01:07:16.380 align:start position:0%
someone who is going through
 
01:07:19.010 --> 01:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy I think in general folks
 
01:07:20.210 --> 01:07:20.220 align:start position:0%
that are going through some of those
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
health conditions appreciate the
 
01:07:25.010 --> 01:07:25.020 align:start position:0%
alternative treatment centers we have
 
01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:27.240 align:start position:0%
here the fact is it's expensive and
 
01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:29.220 align:start position:0%
nothing and it's all cash
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
um so you know insurance doesn't pay for
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
it or anything so regardless flower
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
which is the you know the vegetative
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
Port whether you smoke it or somehow or
 
01:07:40.069 --> 01:07:40.079 align:start position:0%
the products the Edibles The Vapor
 
01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:41.579 align:start position:0%
cartridges those things are all
 
01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:43.859 align:start position:0%
expensive so yes they feel the impact of
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
that market outside the flex program it
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
so I've encouraged them to I forget the
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
gentleman's name that has been running
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
that for a while but I I've been
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
encouraging them now for three or four
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
terms to keep coming back to the
 
01:07:59.930 --> 01:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
legislature with proposals so that they
 
01:08:03.230 --> 01:08:03.240 align:start position:0%
can continue to be competitive that's a
 
01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
program that I think we want to sustain
 
01:08:06.589 --> 01:08:06.599 align:start position:0%
regardless of what we do with
 
01:08:09.529 --> 01:08:09.539 align:start position:0%
recreational pot I I appreciate that and
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
I think we've made some subtle change
 
01:08:12.890 --> 01:08:12.900 align:start position:0%
we've made incremental changes over the
 
01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:15.000 align:start position:0%
past couple years to help them along the
 
01:08:16.970 --> 01:08:16.980 align:start position:0%
way things like visiting patients we're
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
now going to allow for visiting patients
 
01:08:20.329 --> 01:08:20.339 align:start position:0%
from out of state to come and use those
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
resources we've made some internal
 
01:08:24.349 --> 01:08:24.359 align:start position:0%
changes again but there hasn't been any
 
01:08:26.930 --> 01:08:26.940 align:start position:0%
sort of we can't address the big gorilla
 
01:08:28.970 --> 01:08:28.980 align:start position:0%
which is the recreational Market that
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
exists all around us right and then
 
01:08:32.390 --> 01:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
Hospital flux and Hospital Flex program
 
01:08:35.090 --> 01:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
this is where we it's 100 federal funds
 
01:08:37.729 --> 01:08:37.739 align:start position:0%
and we work with our partners to do
 
01:08:40.309 --> 01:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
um to support those little hospitals for
 
01:08:42.229 --> 01:08:42.239 align:start position:0%
the most part to do things like Medicare
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
boot camp where we pay for training so
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
that those little hospitals can maximize
 
01:08:49.249 --> 01:08:49.259 align:start position:0%
revenues those are the piece the
 
01:08:50.930 --> 01:08:50.940 align:start position:0%
hospital we work with the hospitals and
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
with the hospital Association in order
 
01:08:54.890 --> 01:08:54.900 align:start position:0%
to ensure that they have the sort of
 
01:08:57.050 --> 01:08:57.060 align:start position:0%
technical support that they need so that
 
01:08:58.010 --> 01:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
they can keep their doors open
 
01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
they can keep their doors open
representative

01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:01.430 --> 01:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:03.110 --> 01:09:03.120 align:start position:0%
I'll be in the running for the number of
 
01:09:04.729 --> 01:09:04.739 align:start position:0%
questions I guess on the prescription
 
01:09:09.829 --> 01:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
monitoring I recall correctly we were
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
um administer sorry we were
 
01:09:14.870 --> 01:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
um the prescriptions per person for
 
01:09:18.530 --> 01:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
opioids was something absurd like a
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
hundred tablets per person in the state
 
01:09:21.950 --> 01:09:21.960 align:start position:0%
or something this goes back a couple
 
01:09:23.809 --> 01:09:23.819 align:start position:0%
years are we still seeing that higher
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
level of
 
01:09:27.650 --> 01:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
um has that dropped off so those numbers
 
01:09:29.930 --> 01:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
have gone down I'm pulling out some data
 
01:09:29.940 --> 01:09:30.950 align:start position:0%
have gone down I'm pulling out some data
here

01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:09:33.470 --> 01:09:33.480 align:start position:0%
um you know I have my trusty computer
 
01:09:35.329 --> 01:09:35.339 align:start position:0%
um we have seen
 
01:09:37.490 --> 01:09:37.500 align:start position:0%
um that the numbers have gone down of
 
01:09:40.430 --> 01:09:40.440 align:start position:0%
actually pills prescribed which is great
 
01:09:42.530 --> 01:09:42.540 align:start position:0%
um we've also in this in the same scene
 
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
the utilization from the providers and
 
01:09:46.669 --> 01:09:46.679 align:start position:0%
the pharmacists go up that's exactly the
 
01:09:49.370 --> 01:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
crisscross that we want to see that the
 
01:09:52.849 --> 01:09:52.859 align:start position:0%
utilization of the data is is up the
 
01:09:55.010 --> 01:09:55.020 align:start position:0%
number of prescriptions are going down
 
01:09:56.990 --> 01:09:57.000 align:start position:0%
to probably what's appropriate the thing
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
that we are most concerned about not
 
01:10:00.110 --> 01:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
only in New Hampshire but across the
 
01:10:02.510 --> 01:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
country is the stimulants on the other
 
01:10:05.270 --> 01:10:05.280 align:start position:0%
hand are starting to creep back up are
 
01:10:07.610 --> 01:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
going up while as opioids are going down
 
01:10:11.870 --> 01:10:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay and then separate question if HB
 
01:10:16.130 --> 01:10:16.140 align:start position:0%
639 passes right and I believe it's gone
 
01:10:17.990 --> 01:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
through the house at this point right
 
01:10:21.350 --> 01:10:21.360 align:start position:0%
Senate is undecided where that goes but
 
01:10:24.050 --> 01:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
if it does go forward what happens to
 
01:10:25.850 --> 01:10:25.860 align:start position:0%
the therapeutic cannabis program as a
 
01:10:28.189 --> 01:10:28.199 align:start position:0%
whole does it become necessary right is
 
01:10:30.830 --> 01:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
it now completely redundant yeah that's
 
01:10:32.810 --> 01:10:32.820 align:start position:0%
that's a really interesting question so
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
my my recommendation would be that it
 
01:10:36.709 --> 01:10:36.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't become redundant that there's
 
01:10:39.590 --> 01:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
always a program there is value for
 
01:10:41.450 --> 01:10:41.460 align:start position:0%
having a program that's carved out for
 
01:10:43.010 --> 01:10:43.020 align:start position:0%
therapeutic needs
 
01:10:44.330 --> 01:10:44.340 align:start position:0%
um for a couple of reasons one around
 
01:10:46.669 --> 01:10:46.679 align:start position:0%
taxing it or any additional fees that
 
01:10:48.590 --> 01:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
you keep it more affordable than you
 
01:10:50.930 --> 01:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
would with the recreational product as
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
well as that we keep the sort of limits
 
01:10:56.149 --> 01:10:56.159 align:start position:0%
around things like testing to make sure
 
01:10:57.649 --> 01:10:57.659 align:start position:0%
that those products are really safe
 
01:11:00.770 --> 01:11:00.780 align:start position:0%
super safe and that we are administering
 
01:11:02.810 --> 01:11:02.820 align:start position:0%
but mainly for an affordability of the
 
01:11:05.930 --> 01:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
program for the participants we would
 
01:11:07.430 --> 01:11:07.440 align:start position:0%
want to keep that separate there are a
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
couple of different options on the table
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
either that stays within DHHS there's
 
01:11:13.310 --> 01:11:13.320 align:start position:0%
been some thought that it could move if
 
01:11:15.350 --> 01:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
there was some sort of liquor plus
 
01:11:17.450 --> 01:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
cannabis commission you know there's
 
01:11:18.890 --> 01:11:18.900 align:start position:0%
been some thought you throw it over
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
there to administer I think there are
 
01:11:22.610 --> 01:11:22.620 align:start position:0%
pros and cons with that right and I
 
01:11:24.290 --> 01:11:24.300 align:start position:0%
understand we're a budget
 
01:11:26.930 --> 01:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
driven group as opposed to a policy I'm
 
01:11:28.610 --> 01:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
just asking because what do we do with
 
01:11:31.490 --> 01:11:31.500 align:start position:0%
the positions and
 
01:11:34.490 --> 01:11:34.500 align:start position:0%
we have um you know historically we we
 
01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
put Public Health put that program back
 
01:11:37.850 --> 01:11:37.860 align:start position:0%
together it was a little bit like Humpty
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
Dumpty when it first started it had the
 
01:11:41.930 --> 01:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
um it was broken out into different
 
01:11:44.209 --> 01:11:44.219 align:start position:0%
sections across the department several
 
01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
bienniums ago we actually moved it all
 
01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
to Public Health to make it coherent to
 
01:11:51.169 --> 01:11:51.179 align:start position:0%
make sure it focused on meeting access
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
to Services which is really what our job
 
01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:57.300 align:start position:0%
is and to keep an eye on the Laboratory
 
01:12:00.410 --> 01:12:00.420 align:start position:0%
Testing of it so is there any way to
 
01:12:02.330 --> 01:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
right now I believe it's cash as you
 
01:12:03.890 --> 01:12:03.900 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier is there any way to
 
01:12:05.990 --> 01:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
tie it back to insurance or not without
 
01:12:08.209 --> 01:12:08.219 align:start position:0%
risking disclosure of the individuals
 
01:12:09.649 --> 01:12:09.659 align:start position:0%
that are on there
 
01:12:11.330 --> 01:12:11.340 align:start position:0%
um I think it's a I think while it is
 
01:12:12.770 --> 01:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
still a federally scheduled the
 
01:12:17.450 --> 01:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.669 --> 01:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
okay all right
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
um 17 just again because I made all
 
01:12:22.729 --> 01:12:22.739 align:start position:0%
these slides I'm going to make you look
 
01:12:23.870 --> 01:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
at them
 
01:12:23.880 --> 01:12:25.189 align:start position:0%
at them
um

01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:27.890 --> 01:12:27.900 align:start position:0%
slide 17 is another piece that sits
 
01:12:30.290 --> 01:12:30.300 align:start position:0%
within that Bureau of something called
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
our Health Professions data center this
 
01:12:34.370 --> 01:12:34.380 align:start position:0%
is a project again under the radar we
 
01:12:36.169 --> 01:12:36.179 align:start position:0%
don't talk about it very much but we've
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
worked with all of oplc with all of the
 
01:12:40.550 --> 01:12:40.560 align:start position:0%
medical boards or health related boards
 
01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
and we get information about providers
 
01:12:45.530 --> 01:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
and this is just an example of that data
 
01:12:47.209 --> 01:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
where we look at the behavior health
 
01:12:49.430 --> 01:12:49.440 align:start position:0%
professionals in the state
 
01:12:51.709 --> 01:12:51.719 align:start position:0%
um almost you know 42 percent are over
 
01:12:54.050 --> 01:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
60 years old of psychiatrists in the
 
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
state and if you look down at that
 
01:12:58.370 --> 01:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
bottom roll we can see that anticipated
 
01:13:00.830 --> 01:13:00.840 align:start position:0%
reduction in capacity over the next five
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
years is is alarming we're certainly
 
01:13:05.290 --> 01:13:05.300 align:start position:0%
losing over a quarter of our staff
 
01:13:08.510 --> 01:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
moving forward and we use this data to
 
01:13:11.750 --> 01:13:11.760 align:start position:0%
support things like our slurp program my
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
favorite acronym in all of Public Health
 
01:13:15.950 --> 01:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
State loan repayment program to really
 
01:13:18.290 --> 01:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
focus on what professionals do we need
 
01:13:21.050 --> 01:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
to attract and retain in the state of
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:13:25.189 --> 01:13:25.199 align:start position:0%
um so that we have Equitable access
 
01:13:27.169 --> 01:13:27.179 align:start position:0%
address state
 
01:13:30.590 --> 01:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
on so this data is counter-intuitive to
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
me you've got older people in psychiatry
 
01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
than you do in psychology
 
01:13:40.850 --> 01:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
um as a percentage but we're expecting
 
01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:42.960 align:start position:0%
to have a higher reduction in capacity
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
of of the younger population a
 
01:13:47.950 --> 01:13:47.960 align:start position:0%
psychologists in the older population of
 
01:13:49.910 --> 01:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists yeah I think it has
 
01:13:51.830 --> 01:13:51.840 align:start position:0%
something to do with also the numbers in
 
01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:52.790 align:start position:0%
something to do with also the numbers in
there

01:13:52.790 --> 01:13:52.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
um you know it is counterintuitive but
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
it gives you that we have fewer
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
psychiatrists to begin with again those
 
01:14:00.350 --> 01:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
are medical professionals with um
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
Advanced Training than even say your
 
01:14:04.250 --> 01:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
psychologists certainly more advanced
 
01:14:06.410 --> 01:14:06.420 align:start position:0%
training than your than your nurse NPS
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
your psych NPS so obviously that data
 
01:14:12.110 --> 01:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
drives a lot of our concern about our
 
01:14:16.370 --> 01:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:18.229 --> 01:14:18.239 align:start position:0%
the the data that we're working looking
 
01:14:21.169 --> 01:14:21.179 align:start position:0%
for we will have a report on the data
 
01:14:23.930 --> 01:14:23.940 align:start position:0%
professions data and the ruralhealth at
 
01:14:27.290 --> 01:14:27.300 align:start position:0%
DH at HHS oversight in March so that's a
 
01:14:29.930 --> 01:14:29.940 align:start position:0%
preview for more to come
 
01:14:33.470 --> 01:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
um psychic I did thank you it's like NPS
 
01:14:35.390 --> 01:14:35.400 align:start position:0%
what's the NP stand nurse practitioner
 
01:14:35.400 --> 01:14:37.970 align:start position:0%
what's the NP stand nurse practitioner
McQ

01:14:37.970 --> 01:14:37.980 align:start position:0%
McQ
 
01:14:39.890 --> 01:14:39.900 align:start position:0%
um slide 18 we're going to move into our
 
01:14:41.689 --> 01:14:41.699 align:start position:0%
Bureau of Public Health protection wave
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
this is only our third of eight bureaus
 
01:14:45.709 --> 01:14:45.719 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to go fast
 
01:14:48.050 --> 01:14:48.060 align:start position:0%
um a significant amount of our
 
01:14:49.910 --> 01:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
regulatory programs sit within the
 
01:14:52.370 --> 01:14:52.380 align:start position:0%
Bureau of population of Public Health
 
01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:53.689 align:start position:0%
Bureau of population of Public Health
protection

01:14:53.689 --> 01:14:53.699 align:start position:0%
protection
 
01:14:55.490 --> 01:14:55.500 align:start position:0%
um in in this is included our food
 
01:14:57.830 --> 01:14:57.840 align:start position:0%
protection radiological Health lead
 
01:15:01.250 --> 01:15:01.260 align:start position:0%
poisoning per lead poisoning prevention
 
01:15:03.229 --> 01:15:03.239 align:start position:0%
um you will see that in this particular
 
01:15:05.750 --> 01:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
bureau there's a lot of fees so things
 
01:15:07.850 --> 01:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
like radiological health is supported by
 
01:15:09.770 --> 01:15:09.780 align:start position:0%
the fees that we gather to go inspect
 
01:15:11.990 --> 01:15:12.000 align:start position:0%
things like mammography machines those
 
01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
things are fairly self-funded as I noted
 
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
earlier with food protection by Statute
 
01:15:18.530 --> 01:15:18.540 align:start position:0%
we're only allowed to keep three hundred
 
01:15:20.870 --> 01:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of the fees that we
 
01:15:22.910 --> 01:15:22.920 align:start position:0%
generate the rest have to be funded by
 
01:15:24.709 --> 01:15:24.719 align:start position:0%
the general fund
 
01:15:26.570 --> 01:15:26.580 align:start position:0%
um lead poisoning supported by both
 
01:15:28.550 --> 01:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
General funds and federal funds as a
 
01:15:30.050 --> 01:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
result of a lot of interest over the
 
01:15:32.149 --> 01:15:32.159 align:start position:0%
past bienniums in reducing lead
 
01:15:35.350 --> 01:15:35.360 align:start position:0%
poisoning among our kiddos
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
so we can take any questions in any of
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
those areas if you'd like or not I can
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
go to slide I have a question on line
 
01:15:42.719 --> 01:15:44.510 align:start position:0%
go to slide I have a question on line
20.

01:15:44.510 --> 01:15:44.520 align:start position:0%
20.
 
01:15:44.520 --> 01:15:45.350 align:start position:0%
20.
um

01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
I you know I know that to some extent
 
01:15:50.330 --> 01:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
we're taking Federal money and we're
 
01:15:52.790 --> 01:15:52.800 align:start position:0%
creating a mobile service to do
 
01:15:55.490 --> 01:15:55.500 align:start position:0%
coronavirus injections
 
01:15:58.430 --> 01:15:58.440 align:start position:0%
um and I'm just curious if maybe that
 
01:16:01.490 --> 01:16:01.500 align:start position:0%
would be an opportunity to leverage some
 
01:16:05.030 --> 01:16:05.040 align:start position:0%
of that Federal money to help us improve
 
01:16:07.550 --> 01:16:07.560 align:start position:0%
accessibility to lead poisoning testing
 
01:16:10.310 --> 01:16:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
that is a very interesting idea that I'd
 
01:16:15.709 --> 01:16:15.719 align:start position:0%
have to think more about okay okay
 
01:16:18.890 --> 01:16:18.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:21.950 --> 01:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you so
 
01:16:23.689 --> 01:16:23.699 align:start position:0%
um would you like a gavel down there
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
would that help absolutely not
 
01:16:32.209 --> 01:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
um bottom of page 18 right 12 positions
 
01:16:35.149 --> 01:16:35.159 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
oh thank you
 
01:16:39.350 --> 01:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
um and it looks like this continues over
 
01:16:43.130 --> 01:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
to the bottom of page 959 right we're
 
01:16:46.970 --> 01:16:46.980 align:start position:0%
spending 2.2 million dollars on per year
 
01:16:51.410 --> 01:16:51.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:53.689 --> 01:16:53.699 align:start position:0%
um how much of that is kits and how much
 
01:16:55.490 --> 01:16:55.500 align:start position:0%
of that is just overhead and
 
01:16:59.209 --> 01:16:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:59.219 --> 01:17:07.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:17:07.250 --> 01:17:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:12.470 --> 01:17:12.480 align:start position:0%
in the governor's Budget on page 958 at
 
01:17:14.030 --> 01:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:15.960 align:start position:0%
um you'll see in state fiscally you're
 
01:17:19.550 --> 01:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
24 and and just to note the increase in
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
in personnel there we uh we actually
 
01:17:26.209 --> 01:17:26.219 align:start position:0%
moved a position from 7936 into this so
 
01:17:28.790 --> 01:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
you will see 800 000 there you'll see
 
01:17:32.330 --> 01:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
with Benefits it's about 1.2 million
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
dollars in Personnel related costs
 
01:17:39.350 --> 01:17:39.360 align:start position:0%
um we we do have a a contract line but
 
01:17:40.729 --> 01:17:40.739 align:start position:0%
Trisha I don't know if you want to speak
 
01:17:42.950 --> 01:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
to to the delivery of services and what
 
01:17:45.890 --> 01:17:45.900 align:start position:0%
those Personnel are providing sure so um
 
01:17:47.930 --> 01:17:47.940 align:start position:0%
in our program we have a number of
 
01:17:50.149 --> 01:17:50.159 align:start position:0%
things that that pays for so primarily
 
01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:52.560 align:start position:0%
it pays for nurse case management we
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
have some CD some federal funds we also
 
01:17:56.450 --> 01:17:56.460 align:start position:0%
use some general funds one of the things
 
01:17:58.850 --> 01:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
that you may recall is over time we have
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
lowered something that's called The
 
01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
Action level for when we take action
 
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
when we support families that comes in
 
01:18:07.250 --> 01:18:07.260 align:start position:0%
two ways one there's nurse case
 
01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
management that comes with that with
 
01:18:10.490 --> 01:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
that lower level and then on the other
 
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
side is the Environmental side where we
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
go out and and test especially in rental
 
01:18:17.630 --> 01:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
homes the other piece that we have used
 
01:18:19.310 --> 01:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
some of the additional General funds is
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
to support individuals both landlords
 
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
and primary homeowners so that they can
 
01:18:29.030 --> 01:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
have access to resources to remediate
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
when lead is found in their house and so
 
01:18:33.470 --> 01:18:33.480 align:start position:0%
that is balanced with some funds that
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
are in HUD to be able to provide some
 
01:18:39.110 --> 01:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
loans and to provide some grants for
 
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
remediation so it's a mix of a lot of
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
different things in that line so we have
 
01:18:44.990 --> 01:18:45.000 align:start position:0%
nurse case management we have basic
 
01:18:47.510 --> 01:18:47.520 align:start position:0%
education one of the things I handed out
 
01:18:49.610 --> 01:18:49.620 align:start position:0%
to you if you want to move I have five
 
01:18:51.530 --> 01:18:51.540 align:start position:0%
of these you can fight over them
 
01:18:54.169 --> 01:18:54.179 align:start position:0%
um we have new baby board books that one
 
01:18:55.370 --> 01:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
of our
 
01:18:57.590 --> 01:18:57.600 align:start position:0%
um one of our staff actually wrote and
 
01:18:59.330 --> 01:18:59.340 align:start position:0%
this is sort of a national thing right
 
01:19:01.070 --> 01:19:01.080 align:start position:0%
now about healthy free lead free me
 
01:19:03.590 --> 01:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
happy happy healthy lead free me
 
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
um and we give these out and all the
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
pediatrician offices so if you have a
 
01:19:08.990 --> 01:19:09.000 align:start position:0%
baby in your life or someone who has a
 
01:19:10.850 --> 01:19:10.860 align:start position:0%
baby make sure that they have that and
 
01:19:12.410 --> 01:19:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's one of the ways that we try to
 
01:19:14.510 --> 01:19:14.520 align:start position:0%
communicate around the importance of
 
01:19:16.790 --> 01:19:16.800 align:start position:0%
lead screening it was nice that somebody
 
01:19:20.630 --> 01:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
wrote it so that we could understand it
 
01:19:23.810 --> 01:19:23.820 align:start position:0%
time next but I think we're short on
 
01:19:26.270 --> 01:19:26.280 align:start position:0%
time so great I'm just struggling with
 
01:19:29.330 --> 01:19:29.340 align:start position:0%
right the contracted program Services go
 
01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
down by north of six hundred thousand
 
01:19:31.739 --> 01:19:32.689 align:start position:0%
down by north of six hundred thousand
dollars

01:19:32.689 --> 01:19:32.699 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:19:35.030 --> 01:19:35.040 align:start position:0%
in the biennium yet the department goes
 
01:19:37.550 --> 01:19:37.560 align:start position:0%
up by 400 so there's a net million
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
dollar difference between
 
01:19:43.550 --> 01:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
right in Lines 102 in total between last
 
01:19:52.850 --> 01:19:52.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.070 --> 01:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
um wait a minute okay
 
01:19:58.490 --> 01:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
gotta okay right so
 
01:20:01.930 --> 01:20:01.940 align:start position:0%
so if if you look at class 102
 
01:20:04.669 --> 01:20:04.679 align:start position:0%
many of those funds are being shifted up
 
01:20:08.630 --> 01:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
to class 74. the reason for that is we
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
are required to identify
 
01:20:13.790 --> 01:20:13.800 align:start position:0%
whether any any award that we provide
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
that's federal dollars is a
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient which would be reflected
 
01:20:21.229 --> 01:20:21.239 align:start position:0%
in class 74 or a contractor as divided
 
01:20:24.950 --> 01:20:24.960 align:start position:0%
by two CFR 200 through 331 and and
 
01:20:26.390 --> 01:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
you'll see throughout these accounts
 
01:20:27.950 --> 01:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
you'll see a number of those movements
 
01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
where we're shifting funds from 102 to
 
01:20:33.050 --> 01:20:33.060 align:start position:0%
74 where originally we thought they were
 
01:20:34.669 --> 01:20:34.679 align:start position:0%
a contractor the easiest way to think
 
01:20:36.169 --> 01:20:36.179 align:start position:0%
about a contractor under the federal
 
01:20:38.450 --> 01:20:38.460 align:start position:0%
definition is they're providing Services
 
01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:40.500 align:start position:0%
either directly to the department or we
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
have primary control over those
 
01:20:44.990 --> 01:20:45.000 align:start position:0%
activities a sub-recipient is typically
 
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
where an organization a contracted
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
organization is providing services on
 
01:20:52.729 --> 01:20:52.739 align:start position:0%
behalf of the department they're in
 
01:20:54.649 --> 01:20:54.659 align:start position:0%
charge of more the programmatic details
 
01:20:56.590 --> 01:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
they may be conducting eligibility
 
01:20:59.330 --> 01:20:59.340 align:start position:0%
determinations as well essentially they
 
01:21:00.530 --> 01:21:00.540 align:start position:0%
have more control over the program and
 
01:21:01.729 --> 01:21:01.739 align:start position:0%
they're providing those Direct exactly
 
01:21:06.410 --> 01:21:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
so I'm just trying to figure out right
 
01:21:11.689 --> 01:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
as we go through right equipment new
 
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
replacement goes up almost doubles
 
01:21:15.890 --> 01:21:15.900 align:start position:0%
between the last biennium and this
 
01:21:20.030 --> 01:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
biennium the the costs are 10 plus
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
actually closer to 15 round numbers
 
01:21:25.850 --> 01:21:25.860 align:start position:0%
between last biennium in this biennium
 
01:21:31.370 --> 01:21:31.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:34.550 --> 01:21:34.560 align:start position:0%
so so you're you're asking okay what are
 
01:21:36.830 --> 01:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
the increases so one of the increases
 
01:21:39.290 --> 01:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
are is the the movement of that one
 
01:21:42.830 --> 01:21:42.840 align:start position:0%
position from 79.36 you'll also see an
 
01:21:45.169 --> 01:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
increase in class 50
 
01:21:46.550 --> 01:21:46.560 align:start position:0%
um where where the governor's
 
01:21:48.590 --> 01:21:48.600 align:start position:0%
recommended budget has included funding
 
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
for additional temporary positions as
 
01:21:53.870 --> 01:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
well that also has a net impact on the
 
01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
benefits line
 
01:21:58.490 --> 01:21:58.500 align:start position:0%
um the let me see here's some quick back
 
01:22:00.470 --> 01:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
of the envelope Map There's I mean
 
01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
there's a slight increase in out of
 
01:22:03.830 --> 01:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
state travel
 
01:22:05.750 --> 01:22:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and some other slight increases but
 
01:22:08.030 --> 01:22:08.040 align:start position:0%
those those Personnel lines are the the
 
01:22:09.890 --> 01:22:09.900 align:start position:0%
key drivers the movement and the and the
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
additional dollars for temporary
 
01:22:12.649 --> 01:22:12.659 align:start position:0%
positions and if I can add those people
 
01:22:14.810 --> 01:22:14.820 align:start position:0%
are because we've lowered that Action
 
01:22:17.330 --> 01:22:17.340 align:start position:0%
level and quite frankly we were
 
01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:17.930 align:start position:0%
level and quite frankly we were
um

01:22:17.930 --> 01:22:17.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:20.100 align:start position:0%
uh I I never want to say I'm thankful
 
01:22:21.649 --> 01:22:21.659 align:start position:0%
for the pandemic but those lower
 
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
screening we were we were certainly
 
01:22:25.790 --> 01:22:25.800 align:start position:0%
prepared that we were going to have a
 
01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
much greater increase in kids that had
 
01:22:29.990 --> 01:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
elevated lead screens that we needed to
 
01:22:32.930 --> 01:22:32.940 align:start position:0%
do something about but um that lowering
 
01:22:35.030 --> 01:22:35.040 align:start position:0%
came right at the pandemic when we also
 
01:22:37.010 --> 01:22:37.020 align:start position:0%
had a dip in the number of kids who were
 
01:22:39.110 --> 01:22:39.120 align:start position:0%
screened so we've sort of slow rolled
 
01:22:41.510 --> 01:22:41.520 align:start position:0%
into this but as more kids get screened
 
01:22:49.010 --> 01:22:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:51.649 --> 01:22:51.659 align:start position:0%
so I can move on to slide 20 again just
 
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
some visual fewer kids have been being
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
screened we anticipate that that's going
 
01:22:58.550 --> 01:22:58.560 align:start position:0%
to go up these numbers you almost got
 
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
the 20. uh on 19. oh
 
01:23:04.850 --> 01:23:04.860 align:start position:0%
there well I'm just I'm just curious
 
01:23:08.689 --> 01:23:08.699 align:start position:0%
because I'm looking at page 960 on the
 
01:23:10.550 --> 01:23:10.560 align:start position:0%
budget book and and
 
01:23:12.770 --> 01:23:12.780 align:start position:0%
um this is where you begin to talk about
 
01:23:16.970 --> 01:23:16.980 align:start position:0%
eph tracking yes also on this page is
 
01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:20.219 align:start position:0%
climate change adaptation where there
 
01:23:22.250 --> 01:23:22.260 align:start position:0%
was money in the current budget that
 
01:23:24.410 --> 01:23:24.420 align:start position:0%
looks like it's all zeroed out yes
 
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
where's that money now sure so um
 
01:23:28.970 --> 01:23:28.980 align:start position:0%
environmental Public Health tracking
 
01:23:30.470 --> 01:23:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's a horrible name if you're worried
 
01:23:31.970 --> 01:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
about people tracking you but it's
 
01:23:33.410 --> 01:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
really just looking at environmental
 
01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
Public Health Data
 
01:23:37.490 --> 01:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to be clear about that
 
01:23:39.709 --> 01:23:39.719 align:start position:0%
the climate adapt climate change
 
01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:41.880 align:start position:0%
adaptation was a Federal grant that we
 
01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
had received and this current biennium
 
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
we no longer will receive that Grant in
 
01:23:51.950 --> 01:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:54.530 --> 01:23:54.540 align:start position:0%
good we we solved the problem that's
 
01:23:54.540 --> 01:23:55.490 align:start position:0%
good we we solved the problem that's
great

01:23:55.490 --> 01:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:23:59.810 --> 01:23:59.820 align:start position:0%
we've solved it was just meant to be a
 
01:24:02.570 --> 01:24:02.580 align:start position:0%
joke go ahead
 
01:24:04.370 --> 01:24:04.380 align:start position:0%
nothing else I need to add to that thank
 
01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:06.649 align:start position:0%
nothing else I need to add to that thank
you

01:24:06.649 --> 01:24:06.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.169 --> 01:24:09.179 align:start position:0%
um so again slide 20 just the data
 
01:24:11.270 --> 01:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
around lead fewer screens we need to get
 
01:24:13.070 --> 01:24:13.080 align:start position:0%
those screening numbers back up as we
 
01:24:14.270 --> 01:24:14.280 align:start position:0%
get those screening numbers up we're
 
01:24:15.590 --> 01:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
going to need those people to take care
 
01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
of the kiddos that's just one of the the
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
takeaways from the past two years
 
01:24:23.750 --> 01:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
01:24:26.630 --> 01:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
thank you so just remind me where did we
 
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
move what are the new values for lead
 
01:24:31.310 --> 01:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
screening I I was out for four years I
 
01:24:34.310 --> 01:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
didn't keep track sure so I think if you
 
01:24:36.709 --> 01:24:36.719 align:start position:0%
look on I've got stuff popping up on
 
01:24:39.169 --> 01:24:39.179 align:start position:0%
here we have if you if you really look
 
01:24:41.270 --> 01:24:41.280 align:start position:0%
in at that data and I'm trying to yeah
 
01:24:42.649 --> 01:24:42.659 align:start position:0%
what was it and what is the current
 
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:44.219 align:start position:0%
value it has moved and I'm going to keep
 
01:24:46.010 --> 01:24:46.020 align:start position:0%
because I'm going to show my age because
 
01:24:48.590 --> 01:24:48.600 align:start position:0%
it was at one time ten it moved down to
 
01:24:51.470 --> 01:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
seven and a half and we are down now at
 
01:24:54.950 --> 01:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
five and uh is this in micrograms per
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
liter yes
 
01:24:58.130 --> 01:24:58.140 align:start position:0%
that's a leader
 
01:25:00.649 --> 01:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
so we are moving moving down
 
01:25:02.450 --> 01:25:02.460 align:start position:0%
um and I think you can see that in in
 
01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:03.649 align:start position:0%
um and I think you can see that in in
there

01:25:03.649 --> 01:25:03.659 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:25:07.910 --> 01:25:07.920 align:start position:0%
um on July 21 and July 1 2021 was
 
01:25:09.770 --> 01:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
lowered from seven and a half to five
 
01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:14.159 align:start position:0%
and for children 72 months and younger
 
01:25:17.030 --> 01:25:17.040 align:start position:0%
so it has gone from 10 down to five over
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
what period of time
 
01:25:21.830 --> 01:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
um over more than a decade it was at
 
01:25:23.810 --> 01:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
seven and a half certainly for a number
 
01:25:26.890 --> 01:25:26.900 align:start position:0%
of sort of the the mid
 
01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:29.100 align:start position:0%
2010s it was at seven out of five I
 
01:25:30.350 --> 01:25:30.360 align:start position:0%
don't remember when we paid that thank
 
01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:33.470 align:start position:0%
don't remember when we paid that thank
you

01:25:33.470 --> 01:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
all right so um the next slide is around
 
01:25:38.810 --> 01:25:38.820 align:start position:0%
food protection you've been hearing me
 
01:25:40.430 --> 01:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
talk a lot about food I love the food
 
01:25:41.870 --> 01:25:41.880 align:start position:0%
program because it never really gets a
 
01:25:43.850 --> 01:25:43.860 align:start position:0%
lot of air time it is one of the oldest
 
01:25:45.530 --> 01:25:45.540 align:start position:0%
things we do in public health when I
 
01:25:48.530 --> 01:25:48.540 align:start position:0%
showed you this book right here one of
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
the main things it talks about is food
 
01:25:52.910 --> 01:25:52.920 align:start position:0%
adulteration and food safety and testing
 
01:25:55.189 --> 01:25:55.199 align:start position:0%
milk that you know like so for over a
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
hundred years this has been what we've
 
01:25:58.310 --> 01:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
been doing
 
01:26:01.550 --> 01:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
um what we license and inspect over 5
 
01:26:03.649 --> 01:26:03.659 align:start position:0%
000 establishments we also do things
 
01:26:05.450 --> 01:26:05.460 align:start position:0%
like with shellfish to make sure when
 
01:26:07.129 --> 01:26:07.139 align:start position:0%
you're having raw oysters you don't get
 
01:26:08.930 --> 01:26:08.940 align:start position:0%
sick and die
 
01:26:11.870 --> 01:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
um and food and beverage manufacturers
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we would like to
 
01:26:16.430 --> 01:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
highlight in here is that we actually we
 
01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
do have a prioritized need in this area
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
for overtime expenses I think that the
 
01:26:24.350 --> 01:26:24.360 align:start position:0%
governor's budget uh may have zeroed out
 
01:26:27.470 --> 01:26:27.480 align:start position:0%
our overtime perhaps inadvertently we
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
need overtime in this place especially
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
when we think about inspectors that are
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
highly trained like our milk inspectors
 
01:26:37.070 --> 01:26:37.080 align:start position:0%
so would you do me a favor tell me the
 
01:26:39.470 --> 01:26:39.480 align:start position:0%
page number and the line item and how
 
01:26:42.530 --> 01:26:42.540 align:start position:0%
much you're you think you need if you
 
01:26:46.669 --> 01:26:46.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:49.610 --> 01:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
and it's class 18 it's at the bottom of
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
page 954. in the agency's original
 
01:26:55.129 --> 01:26:55.139 align:start position:0%
budget submission we had included ten
 
01:26:57.110 --> 01:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of overtime in each
 
01:26:57.120 --> 01:26:58.490 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars of overtime in each
year

01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:27:00.350 --> 01:27:00.360 align:start position:0%
um we had also submitted an additional
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
prioritized need which which was not
 
01:27:05.930 --> 01:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
funded for fifteen thousand dollars so
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
so that would have been twenty five
 
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
thousand it would have been 25 000 total
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
um and and the reason that we're asking
 
01:27:14.450 --> 01:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
for that is because on an annual basis
 
01:27:16.669 --> 01:27:16.679 align:start position:0%
we have exceeded our ten thousand
 
01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:19.260 align:start position:0%
dollars on a pretty regular basis by by
 
01:27:20.510 --> 01:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
a significant amount and it's always
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
required transferred so we're requesting
 
01:27:25.010 --> 01:27:25.020 align:start position:0%
this amount to reflect what is closer to
 
01:27:26.750 --> 01:27:26.760 align:start position:0%
the actual cost that we incur each year
 
01:27:29.629 --> 01:27:29.639 align:start position:0%
so any amount here would also be subject
 
01:27:31.610 --> 01:27:31.620 align:start position:0%
to the 10 percent pay raise and would
 
01:27:34.669 --> 01:27:34.679 align:start position:0%
also be subject to additional benefits
 
01:27:37.970 --> 01:27:37.980 align:start position:0%
yes so so even if it was ten thousand
 
01:27:40.310 --> 01:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
dollars it's probably more like nineteen
 
01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.810 align:start position:0%
dollars it's probably more like nineteen
thousand

01:27:41.810 --> 01:27:41.820 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
01:27:44.330 --> 01:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
we are we need at a minimum twenty five
 
01:27:46.729 --> 01:27:46.739 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars in here you know I and
 
01:27:48.470 --> 01:27:48.480 align:start position:0%
just to give you color behind that we
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
have two major milk inspectors which is
 
01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
why I keep talking about it one of them
 
01:27:54.410 --> 01:27:54.420 align:start position:0%
is on an extended medical leave we have
 
01:27:56.629 --> 01:27:56.639 align:start position:0%
one milk inspector to make sure that all
 
01:27:58.669 --> 01:27:58.679 align:start position:0%
milk that is sold outside
 
01:28:00.649 --> 01:28:00.659 align:start position:0%
um it needs to be blessed by our staff
 
01:28:03.530 --> 01:28:03.540 align:start position:0%
before in for at Federal for federal law
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
before it can do go to interstate
 
01:28:07.189 --> 01:28:07.199 align:start position:0%
commerce so we have we've been working
 
01:28:09.530 --> 01:28:09.540 align:start position:0%
someone and we've maxed out their comp
 
01:28:12.110 --> 01:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
time into and we've aired into like
 
01:28:14.930 --> 01:28:14.940 align:start position:0%
federal labor standards act problems we
 
01:28:16.669 --> 01:28:16.679 align:start position:0%
need overtime also representative
 
01:28:16.679 --> 01:28:18.290 align:start position:0%
need overtime also representative
norgren

01:28:18.290 --> 01:28:18.300 align:start position:0%
norgren
 
01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm just open to asking Mr Ripple
 
01:28:24.709 --> 01:28:24.719 align:start position:0%
to keep track of this and this could be
 
01:28:26.810 --> 01:28:26.820 align:start position:0%
one of our one of our agreed upon
 
01:28:29.330 --> 01:28:29.340 align:start position:0%
plus-ups if you would agree
 
01:28:32.990 --> 01:28:33.000 align:start position:0%
yeah and and and because I'm cheap I I
 
01:28:35.030 --> 01:28:35.040 align:start position:0%
would just throw 20 at it knowing that
 
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
it's going to be much more than 20 by
 
01:28:39.169 --> 01:28:39.179 align:start position:0%
the time you do 10 pay raise and
 
01:28:40.729 --> 01:28:40.739 align:start position:0%
benefits and
 
01:28:43.669 --> 01:28:43.679 align:start position:0%
so could we keep track of 20 for that
 
01:28:46.970 --> 01:28:46.980 align:start position:0%
sure thank you representative hole
 
01:28:49.970 --> 01:28:49.980 align:start position:0%
um looking at page 955 for this
 
01:28:52.129 --> 01:28:52.139 align:start position:0%
department right it looks like there's
 
01:28:54.770 --> 01:28:54.780 align:start position:0%
also a request to go from 14 to 16 is to
 
01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
additional people are they moving over
 
01:28:57.709 --> 01:28:57.719 align:start position:0%
from a different department or is this
 
01:28:59.750 --> 01:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
unveiled positions
 
01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.030 align:start position:0%
unveiled positions
sure

01:29:01.030 --> 01:29:01.040 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:29:03.950 --> 01:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
here's the conversions yeah so on page
 
01:29:08.090 --> 01:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
955 you'll see the class 50 the 105
 
01:29:10.129 --> 01:29:10.139 align:start position:0%
being zeroed out
 
01:29:12.169 --> 01:29:12.179 align:start position:0%
um those the two temporary positions
 
01:29:13.550 --> 01:29:13.560 align:start position:0%
that are there are being converted and
 
01:29:16.250 --> 01:29:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.830 --> 01:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you of course great
 
01:29:24.890 --> 01:29:24.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:26.990 --> 01:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
um uh just kind of a new newbie question
 
01:29:28.790 --> 01:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
here is uh
 
01:29:30.229 --> 01:29:30.239 align:start position:0%
um you know obviously we have a lot of
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
Staff openings which Drive tends to
 
01:29:34.610 --> 01:29:34.620 align:start position:0%
drive over time
 
01:29:36.770 --> 01:29:36.780 align:start position:0%
um to higher numbers
 
01:29:38.570 --> 01:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
um would we expect the same kind of
 
01:29:42.350 --> 01:29:42.360 align:start position:0%
overtime numbers if we were fully
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
staffed uh based on the budget
 
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.129 align:start position:0%
staffed uh based on the budget
um

01:29:46.129 --> 01:29:46.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:47.990 --> 01:29:48.000 align:start position:0%
certainly being fully staffed would be
 
01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:49.129 align:start position:0%
certainly being fully staffed would be
helpful

01:29:49.129 --> 01:29:49.139 align:start position:0%
helpful
 
01:29:50.689 --> 01:29:50.699 align:start position:0%
um this is not an area where we have
 
01:29:53.209 --> 01:29:53.219 align:start position:0%
massive openings right now what's also
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
driving this is we have an increased
 
01:29:57.229 --> 01:29:57.239 align:start position:0%
number of licensees in the community and
 
01:30:00.050 --> 01:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
it's also seasonal so it's not so if you
 
01:30:01.669 --> 01:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
think about the summer time where we
 
01:30:03.470 --> 01:30:03.480 align:start position:0%
have food trucks and Boardwalk
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
facilities and all sorts of things that
 
01:30:08.270 --> 01:30:08.280 align:start position:0%
pop up so we tend to accumulate overtime
 
01:30:11.450 --> 01:30:11.460 align:start position:0%
seasonally and then it pops back down so
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
I think overtime is sort of always going
 
01:30:14.629 --> 01:30:14.639 align:start position:0%
to be a
 
01:30:16.729 --> 01:30:16.739 align:start position:0%
part of the price of doing business in
 
01:30:19.370 --> 01:30:19.380 align:start position:0%
this work because of some of the the ups
 
01:30:22.189 --> 01:30:22.199 align:start position:0%
and downs thank you
 
01:30:24.350 --> 01:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
great so
 
01:30:26.510 --> 01:30:26.520 align:start position:0%
what opportunities are there for some
 
01:30:29.470 --> 01:30:29.480 align:start position:0%
level of self-assessments Slash
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
self-inspection at maintenance instead
 
01:30:34.610 --> 01:30:34.620 align:start position:0%
of having
 
01:30:34.620 --> 01:30:35.209 align:start position:0%
of having
um

01:30:35.209 --> 01:30:35.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
employees actually go visit these right
 
01:30:41.450 --> 01:30:41.460 align:start position:0%
having the various dairy farms do
 
01:30:44.330 --> 01:30:44.340 align:start position:0%
self-inspection self-certification and
 
01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:46.320 align:start position:0%
then increasing let's say maybe the
 
01:30:48.290 --> 01:30:48.300 align:start position:0%
penalties for
 
01:30:50.810 --> 01:30:50.820 align:start position:0%
falsifying data or anything like that so
 
01:30:52.129 --> 01:30:52.139 align:start position:0%
that we're not doing this that we're
 
01:30:53.629 --> 01:30:53.639 align:start position:0%
allowing the Farms to manage themselves
 
01:30:58.729 --> 01:30:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:01.610 --> 01:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
forward in this space we are navigating
 
01:31:04.189 --> 01:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
between federal law and state law so
 
01:31:05.750 --> 01:31:05.760 align:start position:0%
there are you know again we've talked a
 
01:31:07.189 --> 01:31:07.199 align:start position:0%
lot about milk there's a lot of federal
 
01:31:10.310 --> 01:31:10.320 align:start position:0%
law and FDA regulations that we need to
 
01:31:12.290 --> 01:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
follow that we don't have up but we
 
01:31:14.209 --> 01:31:14.219 align:start position:0%
don't have choices around so that
 
01:31:16.490 --> 01:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
requires someone to come in and take a
 
01:31:18.290 --> 01:31:18.300 align:start position:0%
look at it we've worked very
 
01:31:20.689 --> 01:31:20.699 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with our restaurant you
 
01:31:21.890 --> 01:31:21.900 align:start position:0%
know so I think more about something
 
01:31:23.510 --> 01:31:23.520 align:start position:0%
like restaurants where we may have a
 
01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
little bit more room we've prioritized
 
01:31:29.149 --> 01:31:29.159 align:start position:0%
High need or high risk restaurants over
 
01:31:31.189 --> 01:31:31.199 align:start position:0%
some of the lower risk restaurants as
 
01:31:32.810 --> 01:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
well which is how we've tried to manage
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:40.129 --> 01:31:40.139 align:start position:0%
great so if we go to slide 22
 
01:31:41.510 --> 01:31:41.520 align:start position:0%
um I think that's about halfway through
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
we've spoken for a little over an hour
 
01:31:46.370 --> 01:31:46.380 align:start position:0%
and a half so I might be on par
 
01:31:49.729 --> 01:31:49.739 align:start position:0%
um and uh this is our Bureau of family
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
health and nutrition as I noted earlier
 
01:31:53.570 --> 01:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
this is the place where we've got tons
 
01:31:56.209 --> 01:31:56.219 align:start position:0%
of small grants and big grants there are
 
01:31:57.830 --> 01:31:57.840 align:start position:0%
also some things that are policies that
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
you are sometimes interested in included
 
01:32:04.010 --> 01:32:04.020 align:start position:0%
in these um in this Bureau as well
 
01:32:05.629 --> 01:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
um the sparrow has the most accounting
 
01:32:07.070 --> 01:32:07.080 align:start position:0%
units so we can go through them or you
 
01:32:08.890 --> 01:32:08.900 align:start position:0%
can just ask questions as you would like
 
01:32:11.030 --> 01:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
one of the things I will note to you
 
01:32:13.910 --> 01:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
right off the top on slide 22 the teen
 
01:32:16.189 --> 01:32:16.199 align:start position:0%
pregnancy prevention program we will not
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
be funding that in the next biennium
 
01:32:21.950 --> 01:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
that was put in earlier in the agency
 
01:32:25.430 --> 01:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
phase but it will be zeroed out going
 
01:32:25.440 --> 01:32:28.310 align:start position:0%
phase but it will be zeroed out going
forward

01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner
 
01:32:32.750 --> 01:32:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I was wondering in the
 
01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
pregnancy risk monitoring system what
 
01:32:37.550 --> 01:32:37.560 align:start position:0%
are you what are you monitoring in is is
 
01:32:38.990 --> 01:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
one of them
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
um drug use yes so thank you that's a
 
01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
great question so this is something
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
called our prams survey pregnancy risk
 
01:32:48.649 --> 01:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
monitoring something
 
01:32:52.310 --> 01:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and it is a a survey that we send out
 
01:32:54.530 --> 01:32:54.540 align:start position:0%
to women who have just given birth it's
 
01:32:56.390 --> 01:32:56.400 align:start position:0%
again like all of our surveys it's
 
01:32:59.030 --> 01:32:59.040 align:start position:0%
voluntary in nature but people provide
 
01:33:03.050 --> 01:33:03.060 align:start position:0%
their um information anonymized around
 
01:33:04.970 --> 01:33:04.980 align:start position:0%
what their experience was while pregnant
 
01:33:07.490 --> 01:33:07.500 align:start position:0%
and postpartum as well as some of their
 
01:33:09.790 --> 01:33:09.800 align:start position:0%
health risks which could include
 
01:33:12.950 --> 01:33:12.960 align:start position:0%
substance use not only opioids which you
 
01:33:15.169 --> 01:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
know probably has uh people may not be
 
01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
as forthcoming with something like
 
01:33:18.350 --> 01:33:18.360 align:start position:0%
opioids but one of the things that we've
 
01:33:20.030 --> 01:33:20.040 align:start position:0%
been tracking in here is cannabis use
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
which we find that people are pretty
 
01:33:23.209 --> 01:33:23.219 align:start position:0%
forthcoming about
 
01:33:25.010 --> 01:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
um so that's one of probably one of the
 
01:33:27.950 --> 01:33:27.960 align:start position:0%
best ways we have to generally Trend the
 
01:33:29.510 --> 01:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
use of something like cannabis during
 
01:33:33.610 --> 01:33:33.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.530 --> 01:33:36.540 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney notes that there's
 
01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
still money in the forecasted budget yes
 
01:33:41.390 --> 01:33:41.400 align:start position:0%
because we at the time of writing this
 
01:33:43.189 --> 01:33:43.199 align:start position:0%
we thought we would be getting
 
01:33:44.930 --> 01:33:44.940 align:start position:0%
additional federal funds for the teen
 
01:33:46.729 --> 01:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
pregnancy prevention program we are not
 
01:33:49.010 --> 01:33:49.020 align:start position:0%
applying for those federal funds
 
01:33:52.610 --> 01:33:52.620 align:start position:0%
so going forward my plan is after we go
 
01:33:54.530 --> 01:33:54.540 align:start position:0%
through all of all of the presentations
 
01:33:57.950 --> 01:33:57.960 align:start position:0%
is I provide a series of change requests
 
01:34:00.050 --> 01:34:00.060 align:start position:0%
to the committee to consider this would
 
01:34:01.550 --> 01:34:01.560 align:start position:0%
be one of those technical changes
 
01:34:04.550 --> 01:34:04.560 align:start position:0%
understood thank you of course thank you
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
um the bottom of page 22 is our maternal
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
and child health grant that 5190 that
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
has a lot of things in it but I'll just
 
01:34:12.770 --> 01:34:12.780 align:start position:0%
draw your attention to it that that is
 
01:34:14.689 --> 01:34:14.699 align:start position:0%
the you know as I said it's been around
 
01:34:16.970 --> 01:34:16.980 align:start position:0%
since FDR
 
01:34:18.590 --> 01:34:18.600 align:start position:0%
um and was modernized under Ronald
 
01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:19.910 align:start position:0%
um and was modernized under Ronald
Reagan

01:34:19.910 --> 01:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
Reagan
 
01:34:21.649 --> 01:34:21.659 align:start position:0%
um and is one of the places that we
 
01:34:23.870 --> 01:34:23.880 align:start position:0%
actually have flexibility it is a mix of
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
we have federal funds we also have some
 
01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
general funds that are maintenance of
 
01:34:28.910 --> 01:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
effort that are attached to those
 
01:34:31.070 --> 01:34:31.080 align:start position:0%
um meant much of the general funds that
 
01:34:33.290 --> 01:34:33.300 align:start position:0%
we use in maternal and child health is
 
01:34:34.610 --> 01:34:34.620 align:start position:0%
to support our federally qualified
 
01:34:37.490 --> 01:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
health centers for Primary Care and
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
prenatal care representative hole thank
 
01:34:40.560 --> 01:34:41.330 align:start position:0%
prenatal care representative hole thank
you

01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:34:43.189 --> 01:34:43.199 align:start position:0%
um not sure whether this is for Mr
 
01:34:45.530 --> 01:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
Ripple or Mr White right
 
01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
in terms of these changes because we
 
01:34:52.070 --> 01:34:52.080 align:start position:0%
haven't seen hb2 update sorry hb1 in
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
terms of this update as it works through
 
01:34:55.669 --> 01:34:55.679 align:start position:0%
I guess there's
 
01:34:58.070 --> 01:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
how do we when do we get the next
 
01:34:59.750 --> 01:34:59.760 align:start position:0%
version of this with all the requested
 
01:35:02.209 --> 01:35:02.219 align:start position:0%
changes the 10 percent
 
01:35:02.219 --> 01:35:04.689 align:start position:0%
changes the 10 percent
foreign

01:35:04.689 --> 01:35:04.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
won't be in house bill one it will be in
 
01:35:09.410 --> 01:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
House Bill two um and you won't see it
 
01:35:10.970 --> 01:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
split out by department or accounting
 
01:35:13.550 --> 01:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
unit or anything like that
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
and I expect House Bill 2 to be ready
 
01:35:20.870 --> 01:35:20.880 align:start position:0%
for Signature probably tomorrow
 
01:35:24.050 --> 01:35:24.060 align:start position:0%
great thank you we can move to slide 23
 
01:35:25.790 --> 01:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
which are more accounting units in
 
01:35:27.649 --> 01:35:27.659 align:start position:0%
family and health
 
01:35:30.290 --> 01:35:30.300 align:start position:0%
um and uh in here I'll I'll take note
 
01:35:32.570 --> 01:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
that one of our other prioritized needs
 
01:35:34.850 --> 01:35:34.860 align:start position:0%
that was not included in the governor's
 
01:35:37.729 --> 01:35:37.739 align:start position:0%
um in the governor's budget is in the
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
5260 account which is the WIC
 
01:35:43.010 --> 01:35:43.020 align:start position:0%
supplemental nutrition program again a
 
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
great program that we don't talk about
 
01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:45.830 align:start position:0%
great program that we don't talk about
enough

01:35:45.830 --> 01:35:45.840 align:start position:0%
enough
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
um there is some legislation floating
 
01:35:50.090 --> 01:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
through around WIC Farmers Market this
 
01:35:52.129 --> 01:35:52.139 align:start position:0%
is where if we were to move forward with
 
01:35:54.410 --> 01:35:54.420 align:start position:0%
WIC Farmers Market we would ask for
 
01:35:56.450 --> 01:35:56.460 align:start position:0%
additional General funds to be placed in
 
01:35:56.460 --> 01:35:57.250 align:start position:0%
additional General funds to be placed in
there

01:35:57.250 --> 01:35:57.260 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:36:00.169 --> 01:36:00.179 align:start position:0%
some history on WIC Farmers Market we
 
01:36:01.970 --> 01:36:01.980 align:start position:0%
used to have the program in the 1990s
 
01:36:04.310 --> 01:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
and early 2000s we actually stopped it
 
01:36:06.110 --> 01:36:06.120 align:start position:0%
at that time because it was incredibly
 
01:36:07.790 --> 01:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
administratively burdensome in those
 
01:36:09.110 --> 01:36:09.120 align:start position:0%
years because it used to be that you'd
 
01:36:10.970 --> 01:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
have to have like a paper coupon and
 
01:36:12.649 --> 01:36:12.659 align:start position:0%
you'd have to take that paper coupon to
 
01:36:14.930 --> 01:36:14.940 align:start position:0%
a farmer that accepted it and it just
 
01:36:17.570 --> 01:36:17.580 align:start position:0%
didn't work well fast forward to today
 
01:36:20.330 --> 01:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
when our WIC participants have a
 
01:36:22.129 --> 01:36:22.139 align:start position:0%
essentially what's a debit card and they
 
01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
can swipe and most of our Farmers have a
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
little square that they can accept a
 
01:36:28.850 --> 01:36:28.860 align:start position:0%
swipe we think that it's the time is now
 
01:36:31.669 --> 01:36:31.679 align:start position:0%
to be able to get some matching funds so
 
01:36:34.070 --> 01:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
that we can access federal funds for the
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
um for the Wic Farmers Market
 
01:36:40.129 --> 01:36:40.139 align:start position:0%
so I want to talk about family planning
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
um great that's on page 969
 
01:36:43.020 --> 01:36:44.330 align:start position:0%
um great that's on page 969
and

01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
um so I have a few questions in this
 
01:36:50.330 --> 01:36:50.340 align:start position:0%
area uh one the
 
01:36:54.410 --> 01:36:54.420 align:start position:0%
the actual expense of 22 relative to the
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
adjusted authorization in 23 there's a
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
substantial jump there could you just
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
explain that jump
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
so uh are you are you speaking of the
 
01:37:06.169 --> 01:37:06.179 align:start position:0%
fact that we expended fewer of our
 
01:37:10.750 --> 01:37:10.760 align:start position:0%
general funds it goes from 755 to
 
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
2.817 million right so part of this as
 
01:37:19.070 --> 01:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
we all know we had budgeted to fund a
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
number of Family Planning providers
 
01:37:23.930 --> 01:37:23.940 align:start position:0%
um at three additional family planning
 
01:37:25.189 --> 01:37:25.199 align:start position:0%
providers including Planned Parenthood
 
01:37:26.510 --> 01:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
of Northern New England which was our
 
01:37:28.070 --> 01:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
largest provider and received a
 
01:37:30.530 --> 01:37:30.540 align:start position:0%
significant sum of funds from us those
 
01:37:32.510 --> 01:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
contracts were rejected by the council
 
01:37:34.729 --> 01:37:34.739 align:start position:0%
and so we did not those we did not
 
01:37:37.129 --> 01:37:37.139 align:start position:0%
expend those dollars we did expend
 
01:37:38.990 --> 01:37:39.000 align:start position:0%
dollars on the other four agencies that
 
01:37:40.729 --> 01:37:40.739 align:start position:0%
we per that have Family Planning
 
01:37:42.410 --> 01:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
Services those agencies are in places
 
01:37:44.810 --> 01:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
like amoskege and Lamprey are in
 
01:37:46.790 --> 01:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
community health centers sure that's
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
this authorized amount for the current
 
01:37:49.440 --> 01:37:50.870 align:start position:0%
this authorized amount for the current
year

01:37:50.870 --> 01:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:37:53.450 --> 01:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
um is that likely to be spent or because
 
01:37:54.890 --> 01:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
I don't under I don't believe those
 
01:37:57.410 --> 01:37:57.420 align:start position:0%
contracts were let still yeah we will it
 
01:37:59.930 --> 01:37:59.940 align:start position:0%
we will likely in 23 not spend all that
 
01:38:01.370 --> 01:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
money but what we're looking forward to
 
01:38:04.750 --> 01:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
do in the next biennium is to reallocate
 
01:38:07.490 --> 01:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
some of those General funds to the
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
existing providers and also work with
 
01:38:11.390 --> 01:38:11.400 align:start position:0%
the community to see where else we can
 
01:38:13.610 --> 01:38:13.620 align:start position:0%
use those funds to ensure that we have
 
01:38:15.350 --> 01:38:15.360 align:start position:0%
access to reproductive health services
 
01:38:17.810 --> 01:38:17.820 align:start position:0%
that in a way in which that our Council
 
01:38:20.570 --> 01:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
finds acceptable
 
01:38:24.649 --> 01:38:24.659 align:start position:0%
so one of the things we did with hb2 and
 
01:38:27.729 --> 01:38:27.739 align:start position:0%
I I think there was uh
 
01:38:32.770 --> 01:38:32.780 align:start position:0%
some money put into hb1 for this was to
 
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
incentivize new vendors to step up and
 
01:38:40.070 --> 01:38:40.080 align:start position:0%
and compete for these contracts and I
 
01:38:41.629 --> 01:38:41.639 align:start position:0%
don't remember how much that was whether
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
it was ten thousand dollar spiff for
 
01:38:47.629 --> 01:38:47.639 align:start position:0%
five figures yeah so
 
01:38:50.689 --> 01:38:50.699 align:start position:0%
um so I understand that no one actually
 
01:38:53.629 --> 01:38:53.639 align:start position:0%
qualified to get get that additional
 
01:38:55.970 --> 01:38:55.980 align:start position:0%
money yes no one qualified or no and no
 
01:38:58.010 --> 01:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
one there was not no one tried right
 
01:38:59.689 --> 01:38:59.699 align:start position:0%
that's what I think you're saying
 
01:39:02.510 --> 01:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
there's no one in tried correct okay so
 
01:39:05.390 --> 01:39:05.400 align:start position:0%
if we were to double that would that
 
01:39:08.330 --> 01:39:08.340 align:start position:0%
have an impact on those that may want to
 
01:39:10.910 --> 01:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
compete for it we are always happy to
 
01:39:12.950 --> 01:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
put out new proposals at new requests
 
01:39:14.450 --> 01:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
for proposals to see if there are
 
01:39:16.010 --> 01:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
additional providers that are interested
 
01:39:19.850 --> 01:39:19.860 align:start position:0%
in in meeting the services that we have
 
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
so doubling the incentive for a new
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.669 --> 01:39:31.679 align:start position:0%
okay so I'm I representative norgren one
 
01:39:33.410 --> 01:39:33.420 align:start position:0%
of the things I've submitted to Mr
 
01:39:33.420 --> 01:39:35.050 align:start position:0%
of the things I've submitted to Mr
Ripple

01:39:35.050 --> 01:39:35.060 align:start position:0%
Ripple
 
01:39:39.229 --> 01:39:39.239 align:start position:0%
is a similar to the hb2 item and Family
 
01:39:41.689 --> 01:39:41.699 align:start position:0%
Planning that we did last year that that
 
01:39:44.689 --> 01:39:44.699 align:start position:0%
I think we all had sort of a partisan
 
01:39:47.990 --> 01:39:48.000 align:start position:0%
difference on was just being able to
 
01:39:51.290 --> 01:39:51.300 align:start position:0%
have that incentive pay so that new
 
01:39:54.110 --> 01:39:54.120 align:start position:0%
vendors who hadn't previously received
 
01:39:56.689 --> 01:39:56.699 align:start position:0%
Family Planning money could would be
 
01:40:01.010 --> 01:40:01.020 align:start position:0%
incentivized to compete so so what what
 
01:40:05.810 --> 01:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
I would like to do is is to increase you
 
01:40:08.390 --> 01:40:08.400 align:start position:0%
know double what we did last year Mr
 
01:40:12.050 --> 01:40:12.060 align:start position:0%
Ripple and and and then we can discuss
 
01:40:14.030 --> 01:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
it later you know in a week or two you
 
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
guys can tell me why you think I'm wrong
 
01:40:18.350 --> 01:40:18.360 align:start position:0%
but but that that's one of the things
 
01:40:21.649 --> 01:40:21.659 align:start position:0%
I'd like us to to discuss
 
01:40:24.050 --> 01:40:24.060 align:start position:0%
and and then Mr Ripple one one of the
 
01:40:26.870 --> 01:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
hb2 items that was I think fairly
 
01:40:30.050 --> 01:40:30.060 align:start position:0%
controversial was related to
 
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say it was financial and
 
01:40:32.520 --> 01:40:33.649 align:start position:0%
I'm going to say it was financial and
physical

01:40:33.649 --> 01:40:33.659 align:start position:0%
physical
 
01:40:36.590 --> 01:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
separation and I think we got rid of the
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
physical separation and kept the
 
01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
financial separation and we put that
 
01:40:47.050 --> 01:40:47.060 align:start position:0%
limitation in hb2 does that language
 
01:40:51.649 --> 01:40:51.659 align:start position:0%
live on or do we need to if we wanted it
 
01:40:53.689 --> 01:40:53.699 align:start position:0%
to continue we would have to add it to
 
01:40:55.430 --> 01:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
hb2 again
 
01:40:58.550 --> 01:40:58.560 align:start position:0%
uh I'll have to take a look at
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 from two years ago and see
 
01:41:02.689 --> 01:41:02.699 align:start position:0%
if it was for the biennium only or if it
 
01:41:04.129 --> 01:41:04.139 align:start position:0%
had a repeal date
 
01:41:04.139 --> 01:41:05.330 align:start position:0%
had a repeal date
um

01:41:05.330 --> 01:41:05.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:41:07.189 --> 01:41:07.199 align:start position:0%
I don't recall a repeal date
 
01:41:10.010 --> 01:41:10.020 align:start position:0%
specifically in it but I just don't some
 
01:41:12.530 --> 01:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
of some of the hp2 stuff is only for the
 
01:41:14.810 --> 01:41:14.820 align:start position:0%
budget term and then some of it seems to
 
01:41:18.169 --> 01:41:18.179 align:start position:0%
be more perpetual and I don't know the
 
01:41:20.030 --> 01:41:20.040 align:start position:0%
distinction I'll look it up now if it
 
01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
doesn't say for the biennium only and if
 
01:41:23.270 --> 01:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
it doesn't have a repeal date then it
 
01:41:26.870 --> 01:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
would live on so some aspects of it were
 
01:41:30.470 --> 01:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
chapter law and others were RSA
 
01:41:33.050 --> 01:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
see that you know if I were smarter that
 
01:41:34.430 --> 01:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
would mean something to me because I've
 
01:41:36.350 --> 01:41:36.360 align:start position:0%
heard that term you know probably 10
 
01:41:39.590 --> 01:41:39.600 align:start position:0%
times in the last two years
 
01:41:42.050 --> 01:41:42.060 align:start position:0%
so did I I you want to turn your mic on
 
01:41:43.370 --> 01:41:43.380 align:start position:0%
it's not really relevant chapter lock
 
01:41:44.990 --> 01:41:45.000 align:start position:0%
and live on too
 
01:41:47.990 --> 01:41:48.000 align:start position:0%
okay did you have a question on this in
 
01:41:50.209 --> 01:41:50.219 align:start position:0%
this area yes but when you're done I'm
 
01:41:50.219 --> 01:41:51.470 align:start position:0%
this area yes but when you're done I'm
done

01:41:51.470 --> 01:41:51.480 align:start position:0%
done
 
01:41:55.010 --> 01:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
um so regarding the federal dollars I
 
01:41:57.350 --> 01:41:57.360 align:start position:0%
think they're a little off I believe
 
01:41:59.149 --> 01:41:59.159 align:start position:0%
that I can't this off top my head I
 
01:42:00.830 --> 01:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
believe the title 10 funding from the
 
01:42:03.830 --> 01:42:03.840 align:start position:0%
federal is 800k per year but I could be
 
01:42:05.330 --> 01:42:05.340 align:start position:0%
wrong about that but the difference
 
01:42:07.310 --> 01:42:07.320 align:start position:0%
between that whatever that is and the
 
01:42:09.530 --> 01:42:09.540 align:start position:0%
actual FY 24 not the actual but the
 
01:42:13.310 --> 01:42:13.320 align:start position:0%
budget at fy24 is we were between a two
 
01:42:16.189 --> 01:42:16.199 align:start position:0%
different terms and so you're able to
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
roll over so that explains why the fy24
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
is substantially higher because you're
 
01:42:21.470 --> 01:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
able to roll a bunch over into that and
 
01:42:23.870 --> 01:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
add it into the title 10. but I don't
 
01:42:26.030 --> 01:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
believe the fy25 should also have that
 
01:42:28.010 --> 01:42:28.020 align:start position:0%
extra money in there
 
01:42:31.970 --> 01:42:31.980 align:start position:0%
so um I am looking to to my uh to
 
01:42:33.649 --> 01:42:33.659 align:start position:0%
Shelley back there I think it was
 
01:42:35.629 --> 01:42:35.639 align:start position:0%
because some of it was rolled over we're
 
01:42:39.050 --> 01:42:39.060 align:start position:0%
also in we are also expecting increased
 
01:42:40.550 --> 01:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
federal dollars under this Federal
 
01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:43.189 align:start position:0%
federal dollars under this Federal
Administration

01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
01:42:44.810 --> 01:42:44.820 align:start position:0%
that's already been allocated I mean
 
01:42:48.590 --> 01:42:48.600 align:start position:0%
this Administration yes this so we can
 
01:42:50.629 --> 01:42:50.639 align:start position:0%
adjust this moving forward and make it
 
01:42:52.010 --> 01:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
closer to what the actual notice of
 
01:42:54.410 --> 01:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
award is I I don't have that notice
 
01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
award number off the top of my head I I
 
01:42:57.709 --> 01:42:57.719 align:start position:0%
get that I think you're missing my point
 
01:42:59.570 --> 01:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
I'm not talking specifically about the
 
01:43:01.609 --> 01:43:01.619 align:start position:0%
award I mean I think it's lower than you
 
01:43:02.990 --> 01:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
think but that doesn't really matter
 
01:43:04.550 --> 01:43:04.560 align:start position:0%
but there's a dip but there's definitely
 
01:43:06.169 --> 01:43:06.179 align:start position:0%
not two point whatever it is million
 
01:43:06.179 --> 01:43:07.790 align:start position:0%
not two point whatever it is million
dollars

01:43:07.790 --> 01:43:07.800 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:43:10.129 --> 01:43:10.139 align:start position:0%
okay yeah the awards like 800k I think
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
or something maybe a little more but
 
01:43:13.430 --> 01:43:13.440 align:start position:0%
that differential up to the 2 million is
 
01:43:14.870 --> 01:43:14.880 align:start position:0%
because of what you rolled over from the
 
01:43:16.310 --> 01:43:16.320 align:start position:0%
previous three year whatever it is
 
01:43:18.950 --> 01:43:18.960 align:start position:0%
period but that will not should not show
 
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
my 25 right that additional correct okay
 
01:43:22.380 --> 01:43:23.990 align:start position:0%
my 25 right that additional correct okay
yeah

01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:43:26.090 --> 01:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
so we can work I can work with Nathan
 
01:43:28.010 --> 01:43:28.020 align:start position:0%
and get that number closer if we want to
 
01:43:29.270 --> 01:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
have a change number
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
so so of the general funds for the
 
01:43:33.590 --> 01:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
coming year of eight thirty seven
 
01:43:36.590 --> 01:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
thousand and the federal of two points
 
01:43:39.709 --> 01:43:39.719 align:start position:0%
something is is there a a matching
 
01:43:41.930 --> 01:43:41.940 align:start position:0%
requirement there or is this all
 
01:43:45.770 --> 01:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
separate I remember this to be separate
 
01:43:48.770 --> 01:43:48.780 align:start position:0%
place where um
 
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
Clarity from the Federal
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
go say that
 
01:43:52.800 --> 01:43:54.410 align:start position:0%
go say that
um

01:43:54.410 --> 01:43:54.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:57.050 --> 01:43:57.060 align:start position:0%
federal government in the in the law
 
01:43:59.330 --> 01:43:59.340 align:start position:0%
says they will not pay for the entirety
 
01:44:01.790 --> 01:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
of the program that is what it said from
 
01:44:03.350 --> 01:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
that is what the language says they will
 
01:44:05.870 --> 01:44:05.880 align:start position:0%
not pay for them yes please thank you so
 
01:44:08.629 --> 01:44:08.639 align:start position:0%
the the guidance that is available is
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
include financial support from sources
 
01:44:13.729 --> 01:44:13.739 align:start position:0%
other than title 10 as no Grant may be
 
01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
made for an amount equal to 100 of the
 
01:44:19.430 --> 01:44:19.440 align:start position:0%
Project's estimated costs
 
01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:21.179 align:start position:0%
there you go that's what the FED spell
 
01:44:23.270 --> 01:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
is okay so there's a lot of numbers
 
01:44:27.290 --> 01:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
below 100 though yeah so representative
 
01:44:29.629 --> 01:44:29.639 align:start position:0%
Waller you had a question here
 
01:44:31.250 --> 01:44:31.260 align:start position:0%
yes I just
 
01:44:33.109 --> 01:44:33.119 align:start position:0%
could you I think you've already
 
01:44:34.970 --> 01:44:34.980 align:start position:0%
explained this to us once before but
 
01:44:37.669 --> 01:44:37.679 align:start position:0%
could you go again explain the
 
01:44:40.070 --> 01:44:40.080 align:start position:0%
difference between the grants for public
 
01:44:43.729 --> 01:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
assistance and contracts
 
01:44:46.729 --> 01:44:46.739 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely so
 
01:44:46.739 --> 01:44:48.649 align:start position:0%
uh absolutely so
um

01:44:48.649 --> 01:44:48.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:52.370 --> 01:44:52.380 align:start position:0%
there's sub-recipient and contractor as
 
01:44:54.770 --> 01:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
defined by federal uniform guidance
 
01:44:59.450 --> 01:44:59.460 align:start position:0%
think contractor is an organization that
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
that we contract with and this is where
 
01:45:02.209 --> 01:45:02.219 align:start position:0%
it gets confusing because I'm going to
 
01:45:05.090 --> 01:45:05.100 align:start position:0%
use contract in both terms we contract
 
01:45:08.090 --> 01:45:08.100 align:start position:0%
with a contractor and they provide those
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
Services primarily to us they're not
 
01:45:13.910 --> 01:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
making eligibility determinations it may
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
be more technical assistance it could be
 
01:45:18.590 --> 01:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
like like some kind of public
 
01:45:20.930 --> 01:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
information initiative something along
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
those lines think many of our I.T
 
01:45:26.330 --> 01:45:26.340 align:start position:0%
um our RIT contracts versus a
 
01:45:29.810 --> 01:45:29.820 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient and our sub-recipients are
 
01:45:32.149 --> 01:45:32.159 align:start position:0%
are those organizations that we contract
 
01:45:34.850 --> 01:45:34.860 align:start position:0%
with that are providing services on
 
01:45:36.830 --> 01:45:36.840 align:start position:0%
behalf of the department and so they
 
01:45:39.229 --> 01:45:39.239 align:start position:0%
have more programmatic control as
 
01:45:41.510 --> 01:45:41.520 align:start position:0%
defined within the contract but they
 
01:45:44.510 --> 01:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
could be one of the key drivers within
 
01:45:46.129 --> 01:45:46.139 align:start position:0%
the federal guidance is are they making
 
01:45:49.310 --> 01:45:49.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility determinations and so we
 
01:45:53.209 --> 01:45:53.219 align:start position:0%
have to report on our sub-recipients and
 
01:45:55.189 --> 01:45:55.199 align:start position:0%
and part of many of the change changes
 
01:45:56.870 --> 01:45:56.880 align:start position:0%
that you're seeing here is is partly
 
01:45:59.450 --> 01:45:59.460 align:start position:0%
clean up to make sure that it's easier
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
for us to track this information going
 
01:46:05.810 --> 01:46:05.820 align:start position:0%
forward because historically sometimes
 
01:46:07.790 --> 01:46:07.800 align:start position:0%
when we budget under the contract line
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
we may or may not know at that point in
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
time whether we're going to have a
 
01:46:14.030 --> 01:46:14.040 align:start position:0%
contractor or we're going to have a
 
01:46:16.310 --> 01:46:16.320 align:start position:0%
sub-recipient and sometimes you really
 
01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
have to dig into the details to make
 
01:46:19.250 --> 01:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
that determination and to make those
 
01:46:21.169 --> 01:46:21.179 align:start position:0%
strategic decisions about how you want
 
01:46:22.609 --> 01:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
to execute the objectives of that
 
01:46:24.770 --> 01:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
program and and I'll just highlight so
 
01:46:27.169 --> 01:46:27.179 align:start position:0%
the way that looks in Family Planning we
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
certainly have our family planning
 
01:46:30.770 --> 01:46:30.780 align:start position:0%
providers that's one type of contract
 
01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
and then we have a contract for our data
 
01:46:35.689 --> 01:46:35.699 align:start position:0%
system and so that's the other type so
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's why you see both yes
 
01:46:44.270 --> 01:46:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:45.890 --> 01:46:45.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:46:45.900 --> 01:46:47.030 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
so

01:46:47.030 --> 01:46:47.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:49.970 --> 01:46:49.980 align:start position:0%
I guess Nathan is it possible with all
 
01:46:52.310 --> 01:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
the changes that we're talking about
 
01:46:54.109 --> 01:46:54.119 align:start position:0%
because we're moving around potentially
 
01:46:55.850 --> 01:46:55.860 align:start position:0%
large sums of money if this two million
 
01:46:58.310 --> 01:46:58.320 align:start position:0%
dollars in 2025 under the federal funds
 
01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:01.139 align:start position:0%
is is maybe off by more than a million
 
01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
for you to either Redline this book as
 
01:47:06.890 --> 01:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
is I don't know if that's an even an
 
01:47:06.900 --> 01:47:08.090 align:start position:0%
is I don't know if that's an even an
option

01:47:08.090 --> 01:47:08.100 align:start position:0%
option
 
01:47:11.870 --> 01:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
can you take hb1 as the governor handed
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
it to us and make the changes in real
 
01:47:15.109 --> 01:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
time on top of it so we can just replace
 
01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
the pages or provide it in some format
 
01:47:21.770 --> 01:47:21.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.689 --> 01:47:23.699 align:start position:0%
wasn't saying Mr Ripple might have the
 
01:47:24.950 --> 01:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
response to that in terms of the way
 
01:47:29.689 --> 01:47:29.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:32.330 --> 01:47:32.340 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure is this something Nathan
 
01:47:33.649 --> 01:47:33.659 align:start position:0%
that you could address in terms of the
 
01:47:37.430 --> 01:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
Department's uh uh yeah so typical
 
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
changes yeah so we have a standard
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
change request form that has the year it
 
01:47:44.810 --> 01:47:44.820 align:start position:0%
has every single class line and then it
 
01:47:46.669 --> 01:47:46.679 align:start position:0%
has the requested change so you'll see
 
01:47:48.709 --> 01:47:48.719 align:start position:0%
class 10 go from a hundred thousand to
 
01:47:50.810 --> 01:47:50.820 align:start position:0%
two hundred thousand and then it'll have
 
01:47:53.450 --> 01:47:53.460 align:start position:0%
the net impact so we have those those
 
01:47:55.790 --> 01:47:55.800 align:start position:0%
documents um and and when we when we
 
01:47:57.890 --> 01:47:57.900 align:start position:0%
work on that change request that makes
 
01:47:59.510 --> 01:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
it very clear as far as what's going
 
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
where what's increasing what's
 
01:48:00.780 --> 01:48:03.370 align:start position:0%
where what's increasing what's
decreasing

01:48:03.370 --> 01:48:03.380 align:start position:0%
decreasing
 
01:48:05.990 --> 01:48:06.000 align:start position:0%
so representative or if I'm going to
 
01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
look to you on this I as I remember this
 
01:48:11.450 --> 01:48:11.460 align:start position:0%
is also Complicated by the idea that the
 
01:48:13.609 --> 01:48:13.619 align:start position:0%
federal government will bypass the state
 
01:48:16.669 --> 01:48:16.679 align:start position:0%
altogether and so we wouldn't see some
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
of those monies that go directly to the
 
01:48:21.770 --> 01:48:21.780 align:start position:0%
the abortion providers so that says
 
01:48:23.990 --> 01:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
that's a separate issue and it's not
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
specifically the abortion providers it's
 
01:48:28.070 --> 01:48:28.080 align:start position:0%
specifically Planned Parenthood of
 
01:48:30.350 --> 01:48:30.360 align:start position:0%
Northern New England and I'm pretty sure
 
01:48:31.970 --> 01:48:31.980 align:start position:0%
that they have not they've not
 
01:48:34.310 --> 01:48:34.320 align:start position:0%
mistakenly included those here there's
 
01:48:36.169 --> 01:48:36.179 align:start position:0%
another issue that's involved where
 
01:48:37.970 --> 01:48:37.980 align:start position:0%
we're between the way the federal
 
01:48:39.890 --> 01:48:39.900 align:start position:0%
government allocates these funds is in
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
either three year or five year I think
 
01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
we just went from a three year to a five
 
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
year and in between those two periods if
 
01:48:47.450 --> 01:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
you have money left and you can within a
 
01:48:49.550 --> 01:48:49.560 align:start position:0%
period you can roll the money forward
 
01:48:51.890 --> 01:48:51.900 align:start position:0%
and between periods if with a waiver you
 
01:48:54.109 --> 01:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
can roll it over a period so we just
 
01:48:55.490 --> 01:48:55.500 align:start position:0%
came between these two periods and
 
01:48:58.010 --> 01:48:58.020 align:start position:0%
between 23 and 24 as I understand it so
 
01:48:59.810 --> 01:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
they got the waiver and they bounced it
 
01:49:02.590 --> 01:49:02.600 align:start position:0%
over into 24 is the way I understand it
 
01:49:06.109 --> 01:49:06.119 align:start position:0%
100 correct so so that explains the 2
 
01:49:08.330 --> 01:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
million is basically whatever the basic
 
01:49:09.470 --> 01:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
title 10 would have been for the State
 
01:49:10.490 --> 01:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire which I think is around
 
01:49:13.669 --> 01:49:13.679 align:start position:0%
800k but I could be wrong plus that
 
01:49:16.729 --> 01:49:16.739 align:start position:0%
plus up so 25 then would only be the
 
01:49:18.590 --> 01:49:18.600 align:start position:0%
amount of the title 10 funding it
 
01:49:20.330 --> 01:49:20.340 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the plus up as well
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
although they'll still be able to roll
 
01:49:22.370 --> 01:49:22.380 align:start position:0%
the funds forward if they don't get
 
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
spent in 24 that's just sort of how the
 
01:49:27.290 --> 01:49:27.300 align:start position:0%
game how the system works
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:31.199 --> 01:49:32.390 align:start position:0%
 
great

01:49:32.390 --> 01:49:32.400 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:49:34.310 --> 01:49:34.320 align:start position:0%
um also not only is Family Planning fun
 
01:49:36.830 --> 01:49:36.840 align:start position:0%
and exciting on this page but we also
 
01:49:38.689 --> 01:49:38.699 align:start position:0%
have our home visiting Grant which is
 
01:49:40.250 --> 01:49:40.260 align:start position:0%
the last of the three things I'm going
 
01:49:42.350 --> 01:49:42.360 align:start position:0%
to come begging for for a prioritized
 
01:49:45.890 --> 01:49:45.900 align:start position:0%
need our home visiting program has been
 
01:49:47.629 --> 01:49:47.639 align:start position:0%
our this home visiting program is
 
01:49:49.370 --> 01:49:49.380 align:start position:0%
federally funded called the maternal
 
01:49:51.770 --> 01:49:51.780 align:start position:0%
infant early childhood home visiting
 
01:49:53.629 --> 01:49:53.639 align:start position:0%
program from the federal level locally
 
01:49:54.950 --> 01:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
this is something called Healthy
 
01:49:56.689 --> 01:49:56.699 align:start position:0%
Families New Hampshire or Healthy
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
Families America incredibly important
 
01:50:00.890 --> 01:50:00.900 align:start position:0%
preventative program really looking at
 
01:50:02.990 --> 01:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
reducing the number of adverse childhood
 
01:50:05.030 --> 01:50:05.040 align:start position:0%
experiences and more importantly
 
01:50:07.970 --> 01:50:07.980 align:start position:0%
supporting young families in the coming
 
01:50:09.830 --> 01:50:09.840 align:start position:0%
biennium we are going to have an
 
01:50:13.310 --> 01:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
opportunity to receive additional funds
 
01:50:15.770 --> 01:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
for home visiting to serve more families
 
01:50:17.990 --> 01:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
it's been very successful we're maxed
 
01:50:19.189 --> 01:50:19.199 align:start position:0%
out in the number of families we can
 
01:50:21.770 --> 01:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
serve but moving forward we will have to
 
01:50:23.750 --> 01:50:23.760 align:start position:0%
have a match
 
01:50:26.050 --> 01:50:26.060 align:start position:0%
um to go with that so we are looking for
 
01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
around 525
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
000 per year as a match so that we can
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
serve of additional families in the
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
coming year I know that's a lot to
 
01:50:35.930 --> 01:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
consider now but I just wanted to put it
 
01:50:38.689 --> 01:50:38.699 align:start position:0%
out into the ether as our third and
 
01:50:41.689 --> 01:50:41.699 align:start position:0%
final prioritized need
 
01:50:44.209 --> 01:50:44.219 align:start position:0%
uh representative Waller
 
01:50:45.950 --> 01:50:45.960 align:start position:0%
so I would like to follow in your
 
01:50:48.350 --> 01:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
footsteps and ask that Mr Ripple put
 
01:50:51.530 --> 01:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
this on our list of things to come back
 
01:50:53.950 --> 01:50:53.960 align:start position:0%
to this 525
 
01:50:57.470 --> 01:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for a match
 
01:50:59.810 --> 01:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
and and if I may just make a point of
 
01:51:02.390 --> 01:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
clarity um just just so you're not
 
01:51:04.209 --> 01:51:04.219 align:start position:0%
seeing different numbers in our original
 
01:51:07.550 --> 01:51:07.560 align:start position:0%
agency request this was 1.25 million
 
01:51:10.729 --> 01:51:10.739 align:start position:0%
each year but we've received it new
 
01:51:12.229 --> 01:51:12.239 align:start position:0%
information since that point in time so
 
01:51:13.790 --> 01:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
that's why you will see a discrepancy
 
01:51:16.490 --> 01:51:16.500 align:start position:0%
between the 525 and the 1.25 so we're
 
01:51:18.709 --> 01:51:18.719 align:start position:0%
asking for less money
 
01:51:20.090 --> 01:51:20.100 align:start position:0%
and is this
 
01:51:23.229 --> 01:51:23.239 align:start position:0%
this 525 for the biennium
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:29.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:51:29.870 --> 01:51:29.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:51:29.880 --> 01:51:31.129 align:start position:0%
yes
great

01:51:31.129 --> 01:51:31.139 align:start position:0%
great
 
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
just Mr Ripple did you it looked like
 
01:51:34.729 --> 01:51:34.739 align:start position:0%
you were going to say something earlier
 
01:51:37.729 --> 01:51:37.739 align:start position:0%
did you see something no no I just I
 
01:51:39.410 --> 01:51:39.420 align:start position:0%
will add that to the list okay if you
 
01:51:42.250 --> 01:51:42.260 align:start position:0%
see something say something
 
01:51:44.090 --> 01:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
yeah just
 
01:51:46.669 --> 01:51:46.679 align:start position:0%
um of the additional 525 most of this
 
01:51:50.390 --> 01:51:50.400 align:start position:0%
budget is uh for um
 
01:51:52.609 --> 01:51:52.619 align:start position:0%
um grants for public assistance and
 
01:51:55.129 --> 01:51:55.139 align:start position:0%
relief would you see it's still going in
 
01:51:58.310 --> 01:51:58.320 align:start position:0%
there and correct could you talk about
 
01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
um what kind of thing that is sure so if
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
you wanted to scoot all the way to slide
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
28 there's a little more information
 
01:52:05.040 --> 01:52:06.470 align:start position:0%
28 there's a little more information
there

01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:52:08.149 --> 01:52:08.159 align:start position:0%
um this program works with young
 
01:52:08.159 --> 01:52:09.590 align:start position:0%
um this program works with young
families

01:52:09.590 --> 01:52:09.600 align:start position:0%
families
 
01:52:11.930 --> 01:52:11.940 align:start position:0%
um from usually prenatal to age three
 
01:52:14.169 --> 01:52:14.179 align:start position:0%
although we have some additional
 
01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
dcyf money we've added to that to serve
 
01:52:19.070 --> 01:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
three to five-year-olds who are it at
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
elevated risk for child abuse so not
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
everybody but we've been able to extend
 
01:52:25.010 --> 01:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
the program a little bit for those that
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
even at a higher risk but um in general
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
we provide voluntary home visiting
 
01:52:31.970 --> 01:52:31.980 align:start position:0%
Services which provide prenatal
 
01:52:34.570 --> 01:52:34.580 align:start position:0%
education Child Development education
 
01:52:37.669 --> 01:52:37.679 align:start position:0%
screening for maternal depression really
 
01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:39.719 align:start position:0%
helping families get connected to places
 
01:52:41.330 --> 01:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
like their Family Resource Center so
 
01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%
that they are supported in the community
 
01:52:45.109 --> 01:52:45.119 align:start position:0%
with what we've learned you know one of
 
01:52:46.310 --> 01:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
the million things we've learned during
 
01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
the pandemic is the need for social
 
01:52:50.629 --> 01:52:50.639 align:start position:0%
connection and and this is a program
 
01:52:52.370 --> 01:52:52.380 align:start position:0%
that supports that sort of social
 
01:52:54.830 --> 01:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
connection and ultimately the outcomes
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
are reduced child abuse rates increased
 
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
access to things like preventative
 
01:53:02.510 --> 01:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
screenings for kids one of my favorite
 
01:53:04.669 --> 01:53:04.679 align:start position:0%
things is we see a decrease in the
 
01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
number of kids who use the emergency
 
01:53:09.109 --> 01:53:09.119 align:start position:0%
department for unintentional injuries we
 
01:53:11.930 --> 01:53:11.940 align:start position:0%
all around supporting parents ability to
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
parent to their best ability
 
01:53:17.330 --> 01:53:17.340 align:start position:0%
is the healthy families of America the
 
01:53:18.770 --> 01:53:18.780 align:start position:0%
contractor that you're working with
 
01:53:20.750 --> 01:53:20.760 align:start position:0%
Healthy Families America is the name of
 
01:53:23.090 --> 01:53:23.100 align:start position:0%
the curriculum that we use so it is an
 
01:53:25.129 --> 01:53:25.139 align:start position:0%
evidence-based curriculum that we put
 
01:53:26.990 --> 01:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
the money out into the communities each
 
01:53:28.490 --> 01:53:28.500 align:start position:0%
of those places that are like Family
 
01:53:31.010 --> 01:53:31.020 align:start position:0%
Resource Centers that participate
 
01:53:33.109 --> 01:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
um become accredited through that entity
 
01:53:35.390 --> 01:53:35.400 align:start position:0%
Healthy Families America so you know a
 
01:53:36.770 --> 01:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
small amount of the money goes back to
 
01:53:38.810 --> 01:53:38.820 align:start position:0%
healthy America families America but for
 
01:53:41.090 --> 01:53:41.100 align:start position:0%
in general the contract money goes into
 
01:53:42.890 --> 01:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
the community to support home visitors
 
01:53:45.109 --> 01:53:45.119 align:start position:0%
to meet families where they are
 
01:53:47.570 --> 01:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
foresee having more contractors or
 
01:53:50.810 --> 01:53:50.820 align:start position:0%
having bigger contracts we uh we
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
anticipate having
 
01:53:55.189 --> 01:53:55.199 align:start position:0%
um the same number of contractors likely
 
01:53:57.350 --> 01:53:57.360 align:start position:0%
we have full Statewide coverage by
 
01:53:59.570 --> 01:53:59.580 align:start position:0%
County we've got a contractor what the
 
01:54:01.370 --> 01:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
additional funds and the it would enable
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
us to do is two things one serve more
 
01:54:05.629 --> 01:54:05.639 align:start position:0%
families so they would have additional
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
Staffing costs so that they could serve
 
01:54:10.970 --> 01:54:10.980 align:start position:0%
more families we've also recognized that
 
01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
and federally we've recognized that the
 
01:54:15.470 --> 01:54:15.480 align:start position:0%
way we've funded these has been pretty
 
01:54:18.470 --> 01:54:18.480 align:start position:0%
low and so the workforce challenge is we
 
01:54:19.609 --> 01:54:19.619 align:start position:0%
need to actually have a little extra
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
money in the game to get the the staff
 
01:54:24.109 --> 01:54:24.119 align:start position:0%
to do the work so this would enable them
 
01:54:25.910 --> 01:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
to give a little bit more of a bump up
 
01:54:27.290 --> 01:54:27.300 align:start position:0%
so that people could have something
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
closer to a livable wage in order to do
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
this really important community-based
 
01:54:31.920 --> 01:54:37.270 align:start position:0%
this really important community-based
work

01:54:37.270 --> 01:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:40.129 --> 01:54:40.139 align:start position:0%
uh so you're saying you're underserved
 
01:54:42.470 --> 01:54:42.480 align:start position:0%
right now because of and do you have an
 
01:54:45.350 --> 01:54:45.360 align:start position:0%
idea of what percentage of newborns are
 
01:54:48.770 --> 01:54:48.780 align:start position:0%
not being offered you know what I I can
 
01:54:50.270 --> 01:54:50.280 align:start position:0%
come back to you with that number right
 
01:54:52.129 --> 01:54:52.139 align:start position:0%
now the program is focused on Medicaid
 
01:54:54.109 --> 01:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
eligible families so again you know of
 
01:54:56.870 --> 01:54:56.880 align:start position:0%
all the families that's still 24 of
 
01:54:59.750 --> 01:54:59.760 align:start position:0%
families right there rather than all
 
01:55:02.209 --> 01:55:02.219 align:start position:0%
um there is a sep just to put it out
 
01:55:04.129 --> 01:55:04.139 align:start position:0%
there there is a separate provision in
 
01:55:07.189 --> 01:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
the Senate's Omnibus in that bill that
 
01:55:09.109 --> 01:55:09.119 align:start position:0%
would actually create some work to say
 
01:55:10.910 --> 01:55:10.920 align:start position:0%
how could you increase home visiting to
 
01:55:12.770 --> 01:55:12.780 align:start position:0%
families Beyond Medicaid eligible so
 
01:55:14.149 --> 01:55:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's a separate line of work that'll
 
01:55:16.189 --> 01:55:16.199 align:start position:0%
happen over there but for the Medicaid
 
01:55:18.649 --> 01:55:18.659 align:start position:0%
eligible families we're nowhere near the
 
01:55:20.450 --> 01:55:20.460 align:start position:0%
capacity that we could be
 
01:55:23.330 --> 01:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Waller
 
01:55:25.070 --> 01:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
I just wondered how many additional
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
families you thought the uh
 
01:55:28.790 --> 01:55:28.800 align:start position:0%
I could probably give that to you after
 
01:55:30.410 --> 01:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
lunch I know it is in one of my notes
 
01:55:32.990 --> 01:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
Here I can pull it right up thanks thank
 
01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.310 align:start position:0%
Here I can pull it right up thanks thank
you

01:55:34.310 --> 01:55:34.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:37.080 align:start position:0%
all right great so we can move to
 
01:55:39.890 --> 01:55:39.900 align:start position:0%
um the other items in
 
01:55:43.430 --> 01:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
um family uh and nutrition is on slide
 
01:55:46.310 --> 01:55:46.320 align:start position:0%
25 there's a number of activities there
 
01:55:49.609 --> 01:55:49.619 align:start position:0%
if you have interest and on 26 as well
 
01:55:52.310 --> 01:55:52.320 align:start position:0%
26 sort of shows that we go to the upper
 
01:55:54.709 --> 01:55:54.719 align:start position:0%
end with our senior nutrition program so
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
not only are we talking about moms and
 
01:55:58.010 --> 01:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
kids but we're also talking about
 
01:55:58.020 --> 01:55:59.510 align:start position:0%
kids but we're also talking about
seniors

01:55:59.510 --> 01:55:59.520 align:start position:0%
seniors
 
01:56:02.450 --> 01:56:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:05.030 --> 01:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
page 977 right
 
01:56:07.850 --> 01:56:07.860 align:start position:0%
um grants for public assistance line 74
 
01:56:07.860 --> 01:56:09.169 align:start position:0%
um grants for public assistance line 74
right

01:56:09.169 --> 01:56:09.179 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:56:15.470 --> 01:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:20.689 --> 01:56:20.699 align:start position:0%
is this because it was in 102. yeah so
 
01:56:23.510 --> 01:56:23.520 align:start position:0%
so on on page 977
 
01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:24.410 align:start position:0%
so on on page 977
um

01:56:24.410 --> 01:56:24.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:28.609 --> 01:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
the the class 74 you're referring to
 
01:56:30.830 --> 01:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
Grants for public assistance relief
 
01:56:33.950 --> 01:56:33.960 align:start position:0%
um you are seeing uh some movement of
 
01:56:36.770 --> 01:56:36.780 align:start position:0%
the uh from from the class 102 to
 
01:56:39.709 --> 01:56:39.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:39.719 --> 01:56:41.689 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:56:41.689 --> 01:56:41.699 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:43.250 --> 01:56:43.260 align:start position:0%
just moving around
 
01:56:45.290 --> 01:56:45.300 align:start position:0%
um of note we will be
 
01:56:47.629 --> 01:56:47.639 align:start position:0%
um at any day now we're expecting a new
 
01:56:49.430 --> 01:56:49.440 align:start position:0%
what's called a nofo and notice a
 
01:56:51.649 --> 01:56:51.659 align:start position:0%
funding opportunity for the next
 
01:56:53.870 --> 01:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
iteration of the opioid data to action
 
01:56:56.930 --> 01:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
program this opioid surveillance so
 
01:56:58.490 --> 01:56:58.500 align:start position:0%
um we you know we think this is where
 
01:56:59.689 --> 01:56:59.699 align:start position:0%
we're going to land
 
01:57:01.189 --> 01:57:01.199 align:start position:0%
um but we will have a new award
 
01:57:01.199 --> 01:57:02.830 align:start position:0%
um but we will have a new award
imminently

01:57:02.830 --> 01:57:02.840 align:start position:0%
imminently
 
01:57:07.370 --> 01:57:07.380 align:start position:0%
transfer and there's doj money in there
 
01:57:07.380 --> 01:57:09.709 align:start position:0%
transfer and there's doj money in there
okay

01:57:09.709 --> 01:57:09.719 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:57:12.830 --> 01:57:12.840 align:start position:0%
all right so we can go um slide 27 just
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
tells you more about WIC you've already
 
01:57:16.370 --> 01:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
heard me saying the Praises of WIC that
 
01:57:18.109 --> 01:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
we would love to support WIC Farmers
 
01:57:20.209 --> 01:57:20.219 align:start position:0%
Market slide 28 talks a little bit about
 
01:57:21.890 --> 01:57:21.900 align:start position:0%
a home visiting and this is the place
 
01:57:24.169 --> 01:57:24.179 align:start position:0%
that we would like to have um additional
 
01:57:26.149 --> 01:57:26.159 align:start position:0%
General general fund not even additional
 
01:57:28.129 --> 01:57:28.139 align:start position:0%
but to have General funds in order to
 
01:57:30.609 --> 01:57:30.619 align:start position:0%
serve more families we can go into
 
01:57:33.410 --> 01:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
infectious disease which is also
 
01:57:34.729 --> 01:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
um everyone's favorite thing Excuse Me
 
01:57:36.589 --> 01:57:36.599 align:start position:0%
Miss Tilly just representative one
 
01:57:38.390 --> 01:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
question here uh with regards to that
 
01:57:40.189 --> 01:57:40.199 align:start position:0%
healthy families in America where
 
01:57:42.770 --> 01:57:42.780 align:start position:0%
specifically what page and line item in
 
01:57:45.530 --> 01:57:45.540 align:start position:0%
the budget is that I will discussion
 
01:57:47.810 --> 01:57:47.820 align:start position:0%
centered around thank you let me just go
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:01.129 --> 01:58:01.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.629 --> 01:58:02.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
so we will go to
 
01:58:07.609 --> 01:58:07.619 align:start position:0%
um slide 29 which is infectious disease
 
01:58:11.950 --> 01:58:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:15.010 --> 01:58:15.020 align:start position:0%
971 page number in the line
 
01:58:20.870 --> 01:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
74. yeah it's it's class 74. yes
 
01:58:22.970 --> 01:58:22.980 align:start position:0%
thank you and and then are you still on
 
01:58:24.290 --> 01:58:24.300 align:start position:0%
slide 28
 
01:58:26.450 --> 01:58:26.460 align:start position:0%
of the color slide 28 is just more
 
01:58:28.729 --> 01:58:28.739 align:start position:0%
information about home visiting I'm
 
01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:30.179 align:start position:0%
curious because we have another
 
01:58:33.410 --> 01:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
postpartum Bill coming around and the
 
01:58:36.290 --> 01:58:36.300 align:start position:0%
the second bullet jumps out at me yes uh
 
01:58:41.270 --> 01:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
it says that you know basically uh this
 
01:58:43.970 --> 01:58:43.980 align:start position:0%
eight week Mark after delivery is a
 
01:58:47.030 --> 01:58:47.040 align:start position:0%
major demarcation point and right now I
 
01:58:48.890 --> 01:58:48.900 align:start position:0%
believe the authorization is for two
 
01:58:53.089 --> 01:58:53.099 align:start position:0%
months so is it is it right to assume
 
01:58:56.229 --> 01:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
that nearly 20 percent of our moms
 
01:58:59.270 --> 01:58:59.280 align:start position:0%
uh lose their eligibility before they've
 
01:59:02.330 --> 01:59:02.340 align:start position:0%
even had a chance to get their their
 
01:59:05.030 --> 01:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
visit or or do they their eligibility
 
01:59:07.310 --> 01:59:07.320 align:start position:0%
continue until we do at least one visit
 
01:59:09.229 --> 01:59:09.239 align:start position:0%
their eligibility
 
01:59:11.629 --> 01:59:11.639 align:start position:0%
um there is a number in postpartum
 
01:59:13.070 --> 01:59:13.080 align:start position:0%
individuals that lose their eligibility
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
eight eight weeks which is why we've had
 
01:59:17.149 --> 01:59:17.159 align:start position:0%
this as a data point for us to try and
 
01:59:19.129 --> 01:59:19.139 align:start position:0%
get them in before they lose their
 
01:59:21.050 --> 01:59:21.060 align:start position:0%
eligibility there's also physiological
 
01:59:22.729 --> 01:59:22.739 align:start position:0%
reasons why you want to have moms in
 
01:59:24.530 --> 01:59:24.540 align:start position:0%
there probably at two six and eight
 
01:59:26.209 --> 01:59:26.219 align:start position:0%
weeks that those are really important
 
01:59:27.890 --> 01:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
times physiologically that and
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
clinically that you need to get your
 
01:59:32.450 --> 01:59:32.460 align:start position:0%
eyes on newly delivered moms
 
01:59:35.689 --> 01:59:35.699 align:start position:0%
um so again this is a holdover of of a
 
01:59:37.490 --> 01:59:37.500 align:start position:0%
policy choice that we've made at a
 
01:59:40.129 --> 01:59:40.139 align:start position:0%
federal level where we lose Medicaid so
 
01:59:41.870 --> 01:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
we've had a push in some of our
 
01:59:44.030 --> 01:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
supportive programs to make sure moms
 
01:59:46.490 --> 01:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
get to those Health Care appointments
 
01:59:49.729 --> 01:59:49.739 align:start position:0%
and we know this um and we are public
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
health has been working with Medicaid to
 
01:59:54.169 --> 01:59:54.179 align:start position:0%
ensure that 12-month postpartum care
 
01:59:57.050 --> 01:59:57.060 align:start position:0%
because we know really at 8 weeks think
 
01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
about babies that's when they start not
 
02:00:01.310 --> 02:00:01.320 align:start position:0%
sleeping through the night moms are
 
02:00:02.990 --> 02:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
under incredible amount of stress and
 
02:00:04.250 --> 02:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
what we've seen in our maternal
 
02:00:06.530 --> 02:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
mortality as you know representative
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
Edwards we've seen the increased risk
 
02:00:12.290 --> 02:00:12.300 align:start position:0%
for overdose and suicide post eight
 
02:00:14.750 --> 02:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
weeks so
 
02:00:16.910 --> 02:00:16.920 align:start position:0%
um getting expanded medicated or getting
 
02:00:18.410 --> 02:00:18.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid coverage postpartum is
 
02:00:20.570 --> 02:00:20.580 align:start position:0%
incredibly important we have managed
 
02:00:22.490 --> 02:00:22.500 align:start position:0%
this with the current system by trying
 
02:00:24.649 --> 02:00:24.659 align:start position:0%
to get as many moms into care as
 
02:00:26.750 --> 02:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
possible by eight weeks did you have a
 
02:00:28.910 --> 02:00:28.920 align:start position:0%
question representative I do
 
02:00:31.970 --> 02:00:31.980 align:start position:0%
sorry this is a naive question so I see
 
02:00:36.350 --> 02:00:36.360 align:start position:0%
81 on page 28 right of Home visited moms
 
02:00:38.689 --> 02:00:38.699 align:start position:0%
I'm reading that interpreting that to
 
02:00:42.470 --> 02:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
mean right 81 of the new new mothers had
 
02:00:44.050 --> 02:00:44.060 align:start position:0%
someone stop at their door
 
02:00:47.510 --> 02:00:47.520 align:start position:0%
to visit them at home or is that to just
 
02:00:49.490 --> 02:00:49.500 align:start position:0%
having an interaction with them whether
 
02:00:52.189 --> 02:00:52.199 align:start position:0%
it's in a PDF pediatrician's office or
 
02:00:53.810 --> 02:00:53.820 align:start position:0%
somewhere else so thank you for the
 
02:00:55.910 --> 02:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
opportunity to clarify that what that is
 
02:00:58.010 --> 02:00:58.020 align:start position:0%
saying is of the people that participate
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
in the home visiting program so again a
 
02:01:02.450 --> 02:01:02.460 align:start position:0%
small number of the overall Medicaid
 
02:01:05.990 --> 02:01:06.000 align:start position:0%
population of that group 81 of that
 
02:01:08.689 --> 02:01:08.699 align:start position:0%
group gets to their doctor's office by
 
02:01:11.030 --> 02:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
eight weeks is that helpful
 
02:01:13.609 --> 02:01:13.619 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:17.030 --> 02:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
sure are you about to get to 29 a.m
 
02:01:19.070 --> 02:01:19.080 align:start position:0%
whenever you're ready no okay so this is
 
02:01:21.410 --> 02:01:21.420 align:start position:0%
a good time checkpoint uh representative
 
02:01:24.109 --> 02:01:24.119 align:start position:0%
nordgren it's noon now
 
02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
would you like us to to continue as
 
02:01:29.570 --> 02:01:29.580 align:start position:0%
we're doing to see how far we can get
 
02:01:32.750 --> 02:01:32.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll postpone a lunch decision for
 
02:01:34.910 --> 02:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
another 30 minutes or so to see how far
 
02:01:37.910 --> 02:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
we get or what's your pleasure
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
okay so how are you doing uh I can go
 
02:01:42.480 --> 02:01:43.370 align:start position:0%
okay so how are you doing uh I can go
forever

02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
forever
 
02:01:46.990 --> 02:01:47.000 align:start position:0%
you seem like you're able to talk
 
02:01:49.189 --> 02:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
there are many questions do you need
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
more water or something can we get you
 
02:01:52.850 --> 02:01:52.860 align:start position:0%
something I'm I'm good so far all right
 
02:01:54.649 --> 02:01:54.659 align:start position:0%
representative hole thank you Mr chair
 
02:01:57.410 --> 02:01:57.420 align:start position:0%
page 981 I'm just looking at the
 
02:02:00.050 --> 02:02:00.060 align:start position:0%
summarization summary for all of this we
 
02:02:02.570 --> 02:02:02.580 align:start position:0%
can go there right we're going from 28
 
02:02:06.649 --> 02:02:06.659 align:start position:0%
million and 34 to 39 for each year in
 
02:02:09.109 --> 02:02:09.119 align:start position:0%
the biennium it looks like most of that
 
02:02:11.450 --> 02:02:11.460 align:start position:0%
is coming out of federal
 
02:02:13.370 --> 02:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
um but I don't understand where this
 
02:02:17.169 --> 02:02:17.179 align:start position:0%
other funds is jumping up by
 
02:02:17.179 --> 02:02:18.950 align:start position:0%
other funds is jumping up by
1.6

02:02:18.950 --> 02:02:18.960 align:start position:0%
1.6
 
02:02:21.410 --> 02:02:21.420 align:start position:0%
um 1.8 million dollars or something if I
 
02:02:24.470 --> 02:02:24.480 align:start position:0%
got my numbers right almost 2 million so
 
02:02:26.209 --> 02:02:26.219 align:start position:0%
other funds can include a number of
 
02:02:27.830 --> 02:02:27.840 align:start position:0%
things in here that is some of our
 
02:02:29.930 --> 02:02:29.940 align:start position:0%
rebate dollars I believe as well as
 
02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:31.320 align:start position:0%
things like our newborn screening
 
02:02:33.890 --> 02:02:33.900 align:start position:0%
program where for every baby that is
 
02:02:36.290 --> 02:02:36.300 align:start position:0%
born in the state the hospitals purchase
 
02:02:37.850 --> 02:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
something called a filter paper which is
 
02:02:39.470 --> 02:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
where you put the screening test on
 
02:02:41.089 --> 02:02:41.099 align:start position:0%
that's how we fund that those are
 
02:02:42.890 --> 02:02:42.900 align:start position:0%
another piece that adds into that other
 
02:02:42.900 --> 02:02:44.149 align:start position:0%
another piece that adds into that other
funds

02:02:44.149 --> 02:02:44.159 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:02:47.229 --> 02:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
so are these coming from other parts
 
02:02:51.470 --> 02:02:51.480 align:start position:0%
within DHHS or is this from private
 
02:02:53.290 --> 02:02:53.300 align:start position:0%
providers in terms
 
02:02:56.390 --> 02:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
again rebates come from the food per the
 
02:02:56.400 --> 02:02:57.470 align:start position:0%
again rebates come from the food per the
food

02:02:57.470 --> 02:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
food
 
02:03:00.229 --> 02:03:00.239 align:start position:0%
um in WIC when we may enter into a
 
02:03:03.290 --> 02:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
contract like with a uh a formula vendor
 
02:03:05.089 --> 02:03:05.099 align:start position:0%
we get a rebate
 
02:03:07.430 --> 02:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
um based on the number of piece a number
 
02:03:09.470 --> 02:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
of food items that we sell we then turn
 
02:03:11.149 --> 02:03:11.159 align:start position:0%
that money back into the program to
 
02:03:12.770 --> 02:03:12.780 align:start position:0%
support the program same thing with the
 
02:03:14.390 --> 02:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
newborn screening that those dollars
 
02:03:16.850 --> 02:03:16.860 align:start position:0%
come from the hospitals and then we we
 
02:03:18.530 --> 02:03:18.540 align:start position:0%
have self-sustain the program from those
 
02:03:18.540 --> 02:03:19.970 align:start position:0%
have self-sustain the program from those
fees

02:03:19.970 --> 02:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
fees
 
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
so they're neither State nor federal
 
02:03:21.480 --> 02:03:22.729 align:start position:0%
so they're neither State nor federal
dollars

02:03:22.729 --> 02:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
02:03:26.450 --> 02:03:26.460 align:start position:0%
So within the above lines where do I
 
02:03:29.450 --> 02:03:29.460 align:start position:0%
find that 1.8 million right the the
 
02:03:31.910 --> 02:03:31.920 align:start position:0%
general funds is pretty level funded on
 
02:03:34.550 --> 02:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
page 981 it's it's
 
02:03:37.970 --> 02:03:37.980 align:start position:0%
reasonably similar to 2023.
 
02:03:39.709 --> 02:03:39.719 align:start position:0%
um however
 
02:03:42.109 --> 02:03:42.119 align:start position:0%
it is different than 2022 and maybe
 
02:03:43.669 --> 02:03:43.679 align:start position:0%
that's part of the variance I don't know
 
02:03:45.470 --> 02:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
but there's a huge jump in the other
 
02:03:45.480 --> 02:03:46.910 align:start position:0%
but there's a huge jump in the other
funds

02:03:46.910 --> 02:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
funds
 
02:03:50.030 --> 02:03:50.040 align:start position:0%
we would have to go back through and
 
02:03:52.310 --> 02:03:52.320 align:start position:0%
look through each account yeah just to
 
02:03:54.350 --> 02:03:54.360 align:start position:0%
identify what the discrepancies are we
 
02:03:55.370 --> 02:03:55.380 align:start position:0%
can certainly follow up with that
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
information yeah
 
02:04:01.250 --> 02:04:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:03.950 --> 02:04:03.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I I think one of them might be
 
02:04:06.530 --> 02:04:06.540 align:start position:0%
just the WIC rebate which went from 2.6
 
02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
to 4 million
 
02:04:10.070 --> 02:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
uh the amount of rebates here you're
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:14.629 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

02:04:14.629 --> 02:04:14.639 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:04:16.729 --> 02:04:16.739 align:start position:0%
um if with the pleasure of the chair I
 
02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
can fill in a couple of questions
 
02:04:19.729 --> 02:04:19.739 align:start position:0%
um from my trusty folks in the back
 
02:04:22.250 --> 02:04:22.260 align:start position:0%
who've been helpful to find answers
 
02:04:24.830 --> 02:04:24.840 align:start position:0%
while I've been up here um so you asked
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
for the number of suicides I'm pleased
 
02:04:27.649 --> 02:04:27.659 align:start position:0%
to know that the number I was about to
 
02:04:29.510 --> 02:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
spit out is correct
 
02:04:34.089 --> 02:04:34.099 align:start position:0%
um 2020 there was 234 suicides 2021 223
 
02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
2022 242. so I was about to say around
 
02:04:41.450 --> 02:04:41.460 align:start position:0%
200 that's the number home visiting
 
02:04:44.830 --> 02:04:44.840 align:start position:0%
number in 2022 we serve
 
02:04:50.209 --> 02:04:50.219 align:start position:0%
522 adults with 306 children in 344
 
02:04:50.219 --> 02:04:52.729 align:start position:0%
522 adults with 306 children in 344
households

02:04:52.729 --> 02:04:52.739 align:start position:0%
households
 
02:04:55.010 --> 02:04:55.020 align:start position:0%
so again tiny numbers when we consider
 
02:04:57.050 --> 02:04:57.060 align:start position:0%
the entire Medicaid population everyone
 
02:05:01.250 --> 02:05:01.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
02:05:05.810 --> 02:05:05.820 align:start position:0%
and if I made it just to clarify uh
 
02:05:09.050 --> 02:05:09.060 align:start position:0%
representative wholes so so on page 981
 
02:05:13.070 --> 02:05:13.080 align:start position:0%
you see the other funds there in 22. and
 
02:05:15.770 --> 02:05:15.780 align:start position:0%
then you see the adjusted authorize in
 
02:05:15.780 --> 02:05:16.850 align:start position:0%
then you see the adjusted authorize in
23

02:05:16.850 --> 02:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
23
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
. so that those are the funds that we
 
02:05:21.109 --> 02:05:21.119 align:start position:0%
actually received so we probably and I
 
02:05:22.430 --> 02:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
can look this up real quick but we
 
02:05:24.649 --> 02:05:24.659 align:start position:0%
probably budgeted at a much higher rate
 
02:05:26.810 --> 02:05:26.820 align:start position:0%
so that's that's what we actually were
 
02:05:32.030 --> 02:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:33.290 --> 02:05:33.300 align:start position:0%
the color comment
 
02:05:35.570 --> 02:05:35.580 align:start position:0%
over time especially with WIC rebates
 
02:05:37.070 --> 02:05:37.080 align:start position:0%
sometimes we've had to accept money
 
02:05:38.990 --> 02:05:39.000 align:start position:0%
because we were budgeted too low so
 
02:05:40.910 --> 02:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
we've just budgeted it high so that we
 
02:05:42.290 --> 02:05:42.300 align:start position:0%
don't have to keep coming back to you at
 
02:05:44.750 --> 02:05:44.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal over and over again
 
02:05:46.510 --> 02:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
02:05:49.129 --> 02:05:49.139 align:start position:0%
as long as I've been doing time checks
 
02:05:51.229 --> 02:05:51.239 align:start position:0%
we we have a couple of people in the
 
02:05:53.830 --> 02:05:53.840 align:start position:0%
audience back here did you did you
 
02:05:56.689 --> 02:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
intend at some point to speak or want to
 
02:05:59.149 --> 02:05:59.159 align:start position:0%
speak or what what what brings you in
 
02:05:59.159 --> 02:06:04.430 align:start position:0%
speak or what what what brings you in
today

02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:08.089 --> 02:06:08.099 align:start position:0%
okay so they're with you yes yes they're
 
02:06:10.430 --> 02:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
they're just us I I just didn't know if
 
02:06:12.229 --> 02:06:12.239 align:start position:0%
anyone was selling tickets to this this
 
02:06:14.330 --> 02:06:14.340 align:start position:0%
is pretty no one else is interested in
 
02:06:17.270 --> 02:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
this all right let's let's keep going
 
02:06:19.910 --> 02:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
okay great so I think we're down to
 
02:06:22.790 --> 02:06:22.800 align:start position:0%
slide 29 which is infectious disease and
 
02:06:24.950 --> 02:06:24.960 align:start position:0%
I lost my spot
 
02:06:24.960 --> 02:06:26.270 align:start position:0%
I lost my spot
um

02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:28.609 --> 02:06:28.619 align:start position:0%
so again our Bureau of infectious
 
02:06:31.370 --> 02:06:31.380 align:start position:0%
disease fewer accounting units in here
 
02:06:33.169 --> 02:06:33.179 align:start position:0%
than the previous Bureau that we just
 
02:06:37.010 --> 02:06:37.020 align:start position:0%
were had we just had Ryan White is the
 
02:06:38.450 --> 02:06:38.460 align:start position:0%
um work that we do to support people
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
with HIV those pharmaceutical rebates
 
02:06:43.310 --> 02:06:43.320 align:start position:0%
are again another other set of funds
 
02:06:46.070 --> 02:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
that are associated with with HIV care
 
02:06:48.169 --> 02:06:48.179 align:start position:0%
Disease Control is sort of our larger
 
02:06:48.179 --> 02:06:49.609 align:start position:0%
Disease Control is sort of our larger
disease

02:06:49.609 --> 02:06:49.619 align:start position:0%
disease
 
02:06:52.669 --> 02:06:52.679 align:start position:0%
um item mosquito control fund and then
 
02:06:54.290 --> 02:06:54.300 align:start position:0%
if you go to the second page that's
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
where we look at more of our vaccine and
 
02:07:00.109 --> 02:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
immunization related funds as well as
 
02:07:03.709 --> 02:07:03.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:06.709 --> 02:07:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:08.810 --> 02:07:08.820 align:start position:0%
um I was wondering where Lyme disease
 
02:07:10.310 --> 02:07:10.320 align:start position:0%
might fit in
 
02:07:11.810 --> 02:07:11.820 align:start position:0%
um in
 
02:07:14.410 --> 02:07:14.420 align:start position:0%
um that would generally fall into
 
02:07:16.970 --> 02:07:16.980 align:start position:0%
Disease Control and the work that we do
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
within our our larger that's the bigger
 
02:07:21.950 --> 02:07:21.960 align:start position:0%
catch-all of some of our federal grants
 
02:07:23.270 --> 02:07:23.280 align:start position:0%
and some of our programs and that's
 
02:07:25.310 --> 02:07:25.320 align:start position:0%
where Lyme disease as we know Lyme
 
02:07:26.930 --> 02:07:26.940 align:start position:0%
disease is a reportable condition we
 
02:07:29.030 --> 02:07:29.040 align:start position:0%
have about 30 reportable conditions that
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
all need to be sent to
 
02:07:33.709 --> 02:07:33.719 align:start position:0%
um to the division of Public Health
 
02:07:36.050 --> 02:07:36.060 align:start position:0%
Services and that is one we certainly
 
02:07:39.770 --> 02:07:39.780 align:start position:0%
have seen those numbers go up over time
 
02:07:43.910 --> 02:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
thank you go ahead um it's just I'm I'm
 
02:07:47.270 --> 02:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
seeing you know some that uh it does
 
02:07:49.729 --> 02:07:49.739 align:start position:0%
does seem to be growing and also I'm not
 
02:07:51.649 --> 02:07:51.659 align:start position:0%
sure best practices in terms of early
 
02:07:54.890 --> 02:07:54.900 align:start position:0%
treatment uh shortly after diagnosis per
 
02:07:57.890 --> 02:07:57.900 align:start position:0%
CDC guidelines is being properly filed
 
02:08:01.430 --> 02:08:01.440 align:start position:0%
uh followed including antibiotics like
 
02:08:06.350 --> 02:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
Dr doxycycline and so um
 
02:08:09.470 --> 02:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
so I just thought I would bring that up
 
02:08:12.410 --> 02:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
during this section so if you have any
 
02:08:14.390 --> 02:08:14.400 align:start position:0%
comments on that yeah no I mean I think
 
02:08:15.649 --> 02:08:15.659 align:start position:0%
we are seeing this with all the
 
02:08:15.659 --> 02:08:17.510 align:start position:0%
we are seeing this with all the
arborviral

02:08:17.510 --> 02:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
arborviral
 
02:08:19.250 --> 02:08:19.260 align:start position:0%
um viruses that we're seeing so whether
 
02:08:21.169 --> 02:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
it's Lyme disease or other tick-borne or
 
02:08:22.910 --> 02:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
mosquito-borne illness we're going to
 
02:08:24.950 --> 02:08:24.960 align:start position:0%
continue to see those go up as our
 
02:08:27.109 --> 02:08:27.119 align:start position:0%
weather changes
 
02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
um we will see more
 
02:08:31.609 --> 02:08:31.619 align:start position:0%
um of these diseases we're just having
 
02:08:33.770 --> 02:08:33.780 align:start position:0%
longer Springs we have less hard Winters
 
02:08:35.570 --> 02:08:35.580 align:start position:0%
even though it's you know the individual
 
02:08:37.129 --> 02:08:37.139 align:start position:0%
weather may not change but as we know
 
02:08:39.410 --> 02:08:39.420 align:start position:0%
climate has certainly changed um and so
 
02:08:42.050 --> 02:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
we are prepared to continue to see that
 
02:08:43.430 --> 02:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
those go up
 
02:08:45.649 --> 02:08:45.659 align:start position:0%
um as we move forward and we work with
 
02:08:47.270 --> 02:08:47.280 align:start position:0%
our clinicians to help with those guys
 
02:08:48.589 --> 02:08:48.599 align:start position:0%
make sure they're following the
 
02:08:50.530 --> 02:08:50.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate guidelines
 
02:08:54.290 --> 02:08:54.300 align:start position:0%
so you're six years here's my favorite
 
02:08:56.450 --> 02:08:56.460 align:start position:0%
question on STDs
 
02:08:58.490 --> 02:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
what what are what are we going to do in
 
02:09:00.290 --> 02:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
this budget cycle that we've not yet
 
02:09:02.930 --> 02:09:02.940 align:start position:0%
done to make sure that public awareness
 
02:09:05.510 --> 02:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
is increased around the prevalence and
 
02:09:08.510 --> 02:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
Trends in STDs thank you
 
02:09:11.330 --> 02:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
um so uh as many in this room know and
 
02:09:12.709 --> 02:09:12.719 align:start position:0%
certainly the people sitting behind me
 
02:09:14.810 --> 02:09:14.820 align:start position:0%
know I love to talk about STDs it's one
 
02:09:16.490 --> 02:09:16.500 align:start position:0%
of you know when I'm not talking about
 
02:09:17.810 --> 02:09:17.820 align:start position:0%
home visiting I'll just talk about
 
02:09:20.810 --> 02:09:20.820 align:start position:0%
chlamydia until the cows come home
 
02:09:24.649 --> 02:09:24.659 align:start position:0%
um so on slides 11 31 and 32 you'll see
 
02:09:26.930 --> 02:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
that we have this increase
 
02:09:28.970 --> 02:09:28.980 align:start position:0%
um in gonorrhea and syphilis we have
 
02:09:30.770 --> 02:09:30.780 align:start position:0%
actually seen a little decrease in
 
02:09:32.629 --> 02:09:32.639 align:start position:0%
chlamydia but I think that's more a
 
02:09:34.070 --> 02:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
question of screening because the
 
02:09:35.510 --> 02:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
physical symptoms of that don't drive
 
02:09:37.010 --> 02:09:37.020 align:start position:0%
you to the doctor in the same way that
 
02:09:38.870 --> 02:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
the physical symptoms of gonorrhea and
 
02:09:41.810 --> 02:09:41.820 align:start position:0%
syphilis get you to the doctor real fast
 
02:09:44.089 --> 02:09:44.099 align:start position:0%
um but but chlamydia is certainly a
 
02:09:45.890 --> 02:09:45.900 align:start position:0%
concern because over time especially for
 
02:09:47.330 --> 02:09:47.340 align:start position:0%
women that can lead to decreased
 
02:09:49.490 --> 02:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
fertility it's a big sort of Silent
 
02:09:52.070 --> 02:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
issue that we want people to address to
 
02:09:53.570 --> 02:09:53.580 align:start position:0%
your question
 
02:09:55.550 --> 02:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
um I think we have more bandwidth to
 
02:09:58.370 --> 02:09:58.380 align:start position:0%
address this we are are working next
 
02:10:01.070 --> 02:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
week actually to make sure that our data
 
02:10:03.290 --> 02:10:03.300 align:start position:0%
is in a much more transparent place we
 
02:10:05.209 --> 02:10:05.219 align:start position:0%
currently do monthly reports you can
 
02:10:07.729 --> 02:10:07.739 align:start position:0%
find them online but they're static
 
02:10:09.530 --> 02:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
um and they look a little bit like you
 
02:10:12.950 --> 02:10:12.960 align:start position:0%
know the 30 slide 32 great information
 
02:10:16.070 --> 02:10:16.080 align:start position:0%
but it's not on our web on our DHHS data
 
02:10:18.050 --> 02:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
portal over the next biennium we're
 
02:10:19.609 --> 02:10:19.619 align:start position:0%
going to move that data to be much more
 
02:10:22.310 --> 02:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
Dynamic and available I think we need to
 
02:10:25.010 --> 02:10:25.020 align:start position:0%
figure out in terms of prevention one of
 
02:10:26.930 --> 02:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
the sad things that's happened with the
 
02:10:29.209 --> 02:10:29.219 align:start position:0%
reduction of Family Planning programs
 
02:10:31.850 --> 02:10:31.860 align:start position:0%
that we can fund part of their work was
 
02:10:34.310 --> 02:10:34.320 align:start position:0%
also to really do education around STDs
 
02:10:36.169 --> 02:10:36.179 align:start position:0%
and we just have fewer people contracted
 
02:10:37.850 --> 02:10:37.860 align:start position:0%
to do that work so we're going to have
 
02:10:40.070 --> 02:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
to find new ways to make sure that
 
02:10:42.709 --> 02:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
individuals especially young adults know
 
02:10:45.109 --> 02:10:45.119 align:start position:0%
to come in and get screened
 
02:10:47.570 --> 02:10:47.580 align:start position:0%
actually we have more money to fund the
 
02:10:49.729 --> 02:10:49.739 align:start position:0%
Family Planning programs we have fewer
 
02:10:52.669 --> 02:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
contractors willing to take the money
 
02:10:55.129 --> 02:10:55.139 align:start position:0%
we have a slight difference in semantics
 
02:10:57.470 --> 02:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
I I would I would just put a finer point
 
02:10:59.629 --> 02:10:59.639 align:start position:0%
on it that our executive Council has
 
02:11:01.490 --> 02:11:01.500 align:start position:0%
rejected some contracts that were bid
 
02:11:01.500 --> 02:11:02.990 align:start position:0%
rejected some contracts that were bid
appropriately

02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
appropriately
 
02:11:07.189 --> 02:11:07.199 align:start position:0%
I I don't disagree okay I I I do want us
 
02:11:09.350 --> 02:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
to to do more to push this information
 
02:11:13.070 --> 02:11:13.080 align:start position:0%
out to the people that might get scared
 
02:11:16.669 --> 02:11:16.679 align:start position:0%
and and behave so I I think that's great
 
02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
and quite frankly we have the bandwidth
 
02:11:21.709 --> 02:11:21.719 align:start position:0%
to do that as we move you know knock on
 
02:11:23.450 --> 02:11:23.460 align:start position:0%
wood we have the bandwidth to do that as
 
02:11:25.669 --> 02:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
we've discussed the same people who do
 
02:11:28.189 --> 02:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
disease investigation for STDs have been
 
02:11:29.390 --> 02:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
the people who have been on the front
 
02:11:31.609 --> 02:11:31.619 align:start position:0%
lines of covid as we've pulled back from
 
02:11:33.830 --> 02:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
covid we have more space that makes
 
02:11:35.750 --> 02:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
sense representative hole thank you
 
02:11:37.430 --> 02:11:37.440 align:start position:0%
you're still ahead of me I'm still I'm
 
02:11:39.169 --> 02:11:39.179 align:start position:0%
still on page 986 coming through
 
02:11:42.290 --> 02:11:42.300 align:start position:0%
vaccinations okay so sorry to take you
 
02:11:42.300 --> 02:11:43.010 align:start position:0%
vaccinations okay so sorry to take you
back

02:11:43.010 --> 02:11:43.020 align:start position:0%
back
 
02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
back
um

02:11:43.910 --> 02:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:11:46.550 --> 02:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
in 2022 we had 17 and a half million
 
02:11:48.410 --> 02:11:48.420 align:start position:0%
spent on vaccinations there's an
 
02:11:52.609 --> 02:11:52.619 align:start position:0%
estimated 16 for 23 24 and 25 a nice
 
02:11:54.350 --> 02:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
round number I have no problem with
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
round number estimates but where will we
 
02:12:00.890 --> 02:12:00.900 align:start position:0%
before covid because I would suspect
 
02:12:03.350 --> 02:12:03.360 align:start position:0%
that 17 million dollars also had a chunk
 
02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
of coveted stuff tied in or not no covet
 
02:12:07.790 --> 02:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
does not show up in there okay
 
02:12:10.669 --> 02:12:10.679 align:start position:0%
okay so then why are we
 
02:12:12.770 --> 02:12:12.780 align:start position:0%
estimating something in a million and a
 
02:12:17.030 --> 02:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:21.470 --> 02:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
so so that this is a revolving fund
 
02:12:23.810 --> 02:12:23.820 align:start position:0%
um and and this is our best estimate um
 
02:12:26.089 --> 02:12:26.099 align:start position:0%
because this is a revolving fund uh we
 
02:12:28.250 --> 02:12:28.260 align:start position:0%
we don't come back through fiscal for
 
02:12:30.050 --> 02:12:30.060 align:start position:0%
these funds just given the unique nature
 
02:12:31.370 --> 02:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
of it based on how it's established
 
02:12:33.890 --> 02:12:33.900 align:start position:0%
within RSA so so that is our best
 
02:12:35.629 --> 02:12:35.639 align:start position:0%
estimate at this point in time and
 
02:12:37.070 --> 02:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
there's fluctuations from year to year
 
02:12:39.470 --> 02:12:39.480 align:start position:0%
okay and then
 
02:12:42.470 --> 02:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
so when it says other right source of
 
02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
funds it falls under revolving funds but
 
02:12:47.209 --> 02:12:47.219 align:start position:0%
there must be it must come out of the
 
02:12:50.569 --> 02:12:50.579 align:start position:0%
general at some point so these are these
 
02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
these are truly other funds the way New
 
02:12:54.770 --> 02:12:54.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ensures that all children
 
02:12:58.069 --> 02:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
regardless of of insurer has access to
 
02:13:00.709 --> 02:13:00.719 align:start position:0%
all recommended childhood vaccines is
 
02:13:02.930 --> 02:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
that the hmos and the commercial
 
02:13:05.149 --> 02:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
providers all come together and
 
02:13:07.430 --> 02:13:07.440 align:start position:0%
essentially give us the money to buy the
 
02:13:09.530 --> 02:13:09.540 align:start position:0%
vaccines we buy the vaccines with those
 
02:13:11.629 --> 02:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
funds so again it's through the insurers
 
02:13:13.910 --> 02:13:13.920 align:start position:0%
we come together we buy the vaccines we
 
02:13:15.950 --> 02:13:15.960 align:start position:0%
distribute it it's just a different way
 
02:13:18.890 --> 02:13:18.900 align:start position:0%
to ensure that we capture all kids and
 
02:13:20.390 --> 02:13:20.400 align:start position:0%
no one falls through the cracks with
 
02:13:22.490 --> 02:13:22.500 align:start position:0%
recommended childhood vaccines okay
 
02:13:26.810 --> 02:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:28.790 --> 02:13:28.800 align:start position:0%
right I think that's everything in
 
02:13:30.350 --> 02:13:30.360 align:start position:0%
infectious disease you can learn more
 
02:13:32.569 --> 02:13:32.579 align:start position:0%
about chlamydia and gonorrhea on your
 
02:13:35.870 --> 02:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:40.069 --> 02:13:40.079 align:start position:0%
uh we can go into slide 33 which is our
 
02:13:40.079 --> 02:13:41.750 align:start position:0%
uh we can go into slide 33 which is our
Laboratory

02:13:41.750 --> 02:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
Laboratory
 
02:13:44.870 --> 02:13:44.880 align:start position:0%
um as well this has two pages some
 
02:13:47.209 --> 02:13:47.219 align:start position:0%
larger funds and and a couple of smaller
 
02:13:49.010 --> 02:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
ones but these are the funds that that
 
02:13:51.649 --> 02:13:51.659 align:start position:0%
support all work at our Public Health
 
02:13:53.709 --> 02:13:53.719 align:start position:0%
lab and so that includes both
 
02:13:57.589 --> 02:13:57.599 align:start position:0%
microbiology chemistry and virology so
 
02:13:59.510 --> 02:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
everything from rabies
 
02:14:02.510 --> 02:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
to gonorrhea um you know in there as
 
02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
well as chemistry around water lab we've
 
02:14:06.709 --> 02:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
certainly heard in the news recently
 
02:14:09.890 --> 02:14:09.900 align:start position:0%
around the increased detection of radon
 
02:14:13.010 --> 02:14:13.020 align:start position:0%
in water our water lab does a great job
 
02:14:16.370 --> 02:14:16.380 align:start position:0%
of helping of uh testing private home uh
 
02:14:18.109 --> 02:14:18.119 align:start position:0%
well owners that want to have their lab
 
02:14:21.709 --> 02:14:21.719 align:start position:0%
they're water tested as well as working
 
02:14:23.750 --> 02:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
with Environmental Services on some of
 
02:14:26.089 --> 02:14:26.099 align:start position:0%
the other water systems that need to be
 
02:14:28.970 --> 02:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
tested does this also include any money
 
02:14:31.729 --> 02:14:31.739 align:start position:0%
spent on laboratory work to support law
 
02:14:31.739 --> 02:14:38.510 align:start position:0%
spent on laboratory work to support law
enforcement

02:14:38.510 --> 02:14:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:40.609 --> 02:14:40.619 align:start position:0%
laboratory that sometimes called the tax
 
02:14:43.790 --> 02:14:43.800 align:start position:0%
lab that really does a lot of the um or
 
02:14:45.290 --> 02:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
the work that they do especially around
 
02:14:48.530 --> 02:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
opioids or substances and other pieces
 
02:14:50.990 --> 02:14:51.000 align:start position:0%
we work closely with them we partner
 
02:14:54.169 --> 02:14:54.179 align:start position:0%
with them where needed and um what we do
 
02:14:57.410 --> 02:14:57.420 align:start position:0%
in public health uh fundamentally with
 
02:14:59.930 --> 02:14:59.940 align:start position:0%
regard to opioids is we have some new
 
02:15:02.569 --> 02:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
opioid Federal money that we're using to
 
02:15:04.970 --> 02:15:04.980 align:start position:0%
be able to do greater testing on not
 
02:15:07.370 --> 02:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
only the the opioid themselves but sort
 
02:15:11.030 --> 02:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
of the human element of uh to get an
 
02:15:13.129 --> 02:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
understanding of what's especially with
 
02:15:15.470 --> 02:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
poly drug use what's in people's system
 
02:15:17.689 --> 02:15:17.699 align:start position:0%
so we do a little bit in that space but
 
02:15:19.790 --> 02:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
very little but the department of safety
 
02:15:21.109 --> 02:15:21.119 align:start position:0%
has its own lab
 
02:15:23.390 --> 02:15:23.400 align:start position:0%
so a few years ago there were some
 
02:15:27.530 --> 02:15:27.540 align:start position:0%
Sensational articles news stories about
 
02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:28.069 align:start position:0%
Sensational articles news stories about
um

02:15:28.069 --> 02:15:28.079 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:15:30.790 --> 02:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
fraud in Laboratories
 
02:15:32.870 --> 02:15:32.880 align:start position:0%
government-run Laboratories to where
 
02:15:34.970 --> 02:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
they weren't doing the sampling or they
 
02:15:37.850 --> 02:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
were faking the results and do I'm just
 
02:15:40.669 --> 02:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
curious I'm not accusing anyone but I'm
 
02:15:43.189 --> 02:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
just curious do we have a systematic way
 
02:15:45.470 --> 02:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
of doing like an independent audit just
 
02:15:48.050 --> 02:15:48.060 align:start position:0%
to kind of you know maintain assurance
 
02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
that that we're running our Labs
 
02:15:57.709 --> 02:15:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:59.330 --> 02:15:59.340 align:start position:0%
um and quality improvement program
 
02:16:01.270 --> 02:16:01.280 align:start position:0%
within the lab where we're doing
 
02:16:03.709 --> 02:16:03.719 align:start position:0%
sampling constant sampling to make sure
 
02:16:06.109 --> 02:16:06.119 align:start position:0%
that we're getting consistent results we
 
02:16:08.089 --> 02:16:08.099 align:start position:0%
have in fact we just passed a contract
 
02:16:10.609 --> 02:16:10.619 align:start position:0%
through governor and Council last week
 
02:16:13.129 --> 02:16:13.139 align:start position:0%
around the system that we use to to
 
02:16:14.930 --> 02:16:14.940 align:start position:0%
collect all that data and make sure that
 
02:16:16.490 --> 02:16:16.500 align:start position:0%
our quality improvement and our quality
 
02:16:20.209 --> 02:16:20.219 align:start position:0%
assurance program is working well I am
 
02:16:22.609 --> 02:16:22.619 align:start position:0%
100 confident in the work that happens
 
02:16:24.229 --> 02:16:24.239 align:start position:0%
within our laboratory we have an
 
02:16:25.970 --> 02:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
extraordinary group of people that are
 
02:16:28.310 --> 02:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
you know work at the highest in
 
02:16:30.709 --> 02:16:30.719 align:start position:0%
integrity and and standards to make sure
 
02:16:33.049 --> 02:16:33.059 align:start position:0%
that what we're doing is correct we use
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
other Laboratories to sort of con to
 
02:16:38.270 --> 02:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
test to make sure you know in layman's
 
02:16:40.009 --> 02:16:40.019 align:start position:0%
term if I get this particular result
 
02:16:42.290 --> 02:16:42.300 align:start position:0%
does that other laboratory also get the
 
02:16:43.910 --> 02:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
same result to make sure that we have
 
02:16:46.330 --> 02:16:46.340 align:start position:0%
quality assurance
 
02:16:50.030 --> 02:16:50.040 align:start position:0%
I do page 991 so I'm looking at the
 
02:16:52.849 --> 02:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
total for this department I can see in
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
section 59 right we're going from
 
02:16:59.570 --> 02:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
roughly 500 000 a year to 800 that's a
 
02:17:02.330 --> 02:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
600 000 change over the biennium but I'm
 
02:17:03.709 --> 02:17:03.719 align:start position:0%
not sure where
 
02:17:06.530 --> 02:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
I'm quickly seeing effectively a one and
 
02:17:10.370 --> 02:17:10.380 align:start position:0%
a half million dollar change over 22 an
 
02:17:13.750 --> 02:17:13.760 align:start position:0%
average of 2023 right 2023 was a
 
02:17:18.290 --> 02:17:18.300 align:start position:0%
3.02 million and we're up to 3.7 and 3.8
 
02:17:21.709 --> 02:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
so I I think what I think for first and
 
02:17:23.270 --> 02:17:23.280 align:start position:0%
and I I will answer all your questions
 
02:17:25.310 --> 02:17:25.320 align:start position:0%
first um I think it's important to
 
02:17:27.469 --> 02:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
remember that the numbers that you're
 
02:17:29.990 --> 02:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
looking at for 2022 2023 are not what
 
02:17:32.330 --> 02:17:32.340 align:start position:0%
was budgeted 22 is the actual expense
 
02:17:33.709 --> 02:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
and there's a variety of factors that
 
02:17:35.870 --> 02:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
feed into that the adjusted authorized
 
02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
is what was budgeted plus any fiscal or
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
other carry forward items
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
um the now the the the class 50 the
 
02:17:48.469 --> 02:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
temporary sorry excuse me class 59 the
 
02:17:50.270 --> 02:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
temporary full-time
 
02:17:53.030 --> 02:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
um we we did add I believe it was a five
 
02:17:55.129 --> 02:17:55.139 align:start position:0%
additional temporary positions I believe
 
02:17:57.530 --> 02:17:57.540 align:start position:0%
to meet the continuing increase workload
 
02:17:59.750 --> 02:17:59.760 align:start position:0%
and then you will also see an increase
 
02:18:02.150 --> 02:18:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the contract line
 
02:18:04.310 --> 02:18:04.320 align:start position:0%
um of of uh almost two hundred thousand
 
02:18:06.530 --> 02:18:06.540 align:start position:0%
dollars there as well I don't know do
 
02:18:08.509 --> 02:18:08.519 align:start position:0%
you know what the contract was I can't
 
02:18:09.830 --> 02:18:09.840 align:start position:0%
remember off the top my head which of
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
the contracts it was
 
02:18:14.209 --> 02:18:14.219 align:start position:0%
and and I I can follow up with that
 
02:18:14.219 --> 02:18:19.429 align:start position:0%
and and I I can follow up with that
information

02:18:19.429 --> 02:18:19.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:22.250 --> 02:18:22.260 align:start position:0%
so is in terms of the Laboratory Testing
 
02:18:24.049 --> 02:18:24.059 align:start position:0%
is this supporting some of the things
 
02:18:27.049 --> 02:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
like the Wastewater testing yes yes it
 
02:18:29.030 --> 02:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
is so
 
02:18:31.490 --> 02:18:31.500 align:start position:0%
in terms of efficacy of testing waste
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
water is that a good place to be putting
 
02:18:36.049 --> 02:18:36.059 align:start position:0%
five additional people I don't think
 
02:18:37.549 --> 02:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
five additional people are going
 
02:18:39.230 --> 02:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
directly to Wastewater in fact I can
 
02:18:41.450 --> 02:18:41.460 align:start position:0%
think of one that is going to to waste
 
02:18:41.460 --> 02:18:42.410 align:start position:0%
think of one that is going to to waste
water

02:18:42.410 --> 02:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
water
 
02:18:44.570 --> 02:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of efficacy we think
 
02:18:46.549 --> 02:18:46.559 align:start position:0%
that this is a place um while we're
 
02:18:48.650 --> 02:18:48.660 align:start position:0%
using it for covid today we're basically
 
02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:51.599 align:start position:0%
cutting our teeth on the covid work but
 
02:18:53.929 --> 02:18:53.939 align:start position:0%
um our folks in the laboratory our phds
 
02:18:55.490 --> 02:18:55.500 align:start position:0%
and our doctors there are really
 
02:18:58.250 --> 02:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
anticipating that moving forward this is
 
02:19:00.530 --> 02:19:00.540 align:start position:0%
going to be an area that we see more
 
02:19:02.270 --> 02:19:02.280 align:start position:0%
growth in we certainly saw in New York
 
02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
state where they found a pocket of polio
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
within a community using Wastewater
 
02:19:09.230 --> 02:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
testing so these are these are
 
02:19:11.150 --> 02:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
methodologies that we think are going to
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
be important moving forward and we can
 
02:19:17.690 --> 02:19:17.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:19.129 --> 02:19:19.139 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:19:19.139 --> 02:19:21.530 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:19:21.530 --> 02:19:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:24.349 --> 02:19:24.359 align:start position:0%
all right you can see where I added some
 
02:19:26.690 --> 02:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
additional data there on slides 35 and
 
02:19:26.700 --> 02:19:27.830 align:start position:0%
additional data there on slides 35 and
36

02:19:27.830 --> 02:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
36
 
02:19:29.030 --> 02:19:29.040 align:start position:0%
um that talks a little bit both about
 
02:19:31.009 --> 02:19:31.019 align:start position:0%
our Water Testing Lab a little bit of
 
02:19:33.169 --> 02:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
biomonitoring that's a program where
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
we've been specifically thinking about
 
02:19:36.889 --> 02:19:36.899 align:start position:0%
the elements that end up in your body
 
02:19:39.290 --> 02:19:39.300 align:start position:0%
those environmental contaminants
 
02:19:41.570 --> 02:19:41.580 align:start position:0%
um food also we we do a lot of testing
 
02:19:43.490 --> 02:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
of food in our food emergency response
 
02:19:46.190 --> 02:19:46.200 align:start position:0%
both from a routine testing of things
 
02:19:48.349 --> 02:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
like shellfish we also have to have
 
02:19:50.630 --> 02:19:50.640 align:start position:0%
capabilities in case there's a public
 
02:19:51.969 --> 02:19:51.979 align:start position:0%
health emergency where someone
 
02:19:54.710 --> 02:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
intentionally puts things in our food
 
02:19:56.389 --> 02:19:56.399 align:start position:0%
that should not be there and so we need
 
02:19:58.190 --> 02:19:58.200 align:start position:0%
to maintain the capacity for that
 
02:19:59.330 --> 02:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of information
 
02:20:03.110 --> 02:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
about Wastewater testing on Slide 36.
 
02:20:05.090 --> 02:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
So speaking of emergencies we can go
 
02:20:08.929 --> 02:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
into slide 37 if you would like that is
 
02:20:10.910 --> 02:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
this is our new Bureau of emergency
 
02:20:13.490 --> 02:20:13.500 align:start position:0%
preparedness response and Recovery we
 
02:20:15.530 --> 02:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
call it deeper it's my favorite name of
 
02:20:17.690 --> 02:20:17.700 align:start position:0%
a bureau the eper bureau
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
um this Bureau came into our budget in
 
02:20:23.810 --> 02:20:23.820 align:start position:0%
the last biennium it used to be the
 
02:20:25.370 --> 02:20:25.380 align:start position:0%
Emergency Services unit used to be
 
02:20:27.349 --> 02:20:27.359 align:start position:0%
underneath the Commissioner's Office a
 
02:20:29.630 --> 02:20:29.640 align:start position:0%
biennium ago it was moved into public
 
02:20:32.710 --> 02:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
health during the pandemic really to
 
02:20:35.450 --> 02:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
improve the coordination we've been
 
02:20:37.250 --> 02:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
working well and also just the oversight
 
02:20:39.349 --> 02:20:39.359 align:start position:0%
because so much of their work is public
 
02:20:41.630 --> 02:20:41.640 align:start position:0%
health related specific and especially
 
02:20:43.610 --> 02:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic so we have an
 
02:20:45.590 --> 02:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
additional we have particular federal
 
02:20:47.210 --> 02:20:47.220 align:start position:0%
funds in there that are all around
 
02:20:49.010 --> 02:20:49.020 align:start position:0%
ensuring that we're prepared for
 
02:20:51.110 --> 02:20:51.120 align:start position:0%
whatever comes next
 
02:20:54.050 --> 02:20:54.060 align:start position:0%
um in any whether that's radiological or
 
02:20:56.809 --> 02:20:56.819 align:start position:0%
via a virus there's a fund in there
 
02:20:58.730 --> 02:20:58.740 align:start position:0%
called the Public Health crisis response
 
02:21:01.370 --> 02:21:01.380 align:start position:0%
that is a general relief funded
 
02:21:03.710 --> 02:21:03.720 align:start position:0%
um account so that we can respond Bond
 
02:21:05.809 --> 02:21:05.819 align:start position:0%
when there's something emergent that
 
02:21:07.730 --> 02:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
comes up and so it's a it's a small
 
02:21:09.590 --> 02:21:09.600 align:start position:0%
amount of money but it allows us to act
 
02:21:13.309 --> 02:21:13.319 align:start position:0%
quickly we use this a little bit of this
 
02:21:14.870 --> 02:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
money just actually very little bit of
 
02:21:16.550 --> 02:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
the money um this past year from Monkey
 
02:21:18.889 --> 02:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
pox for example or mpox as it's now
 
02:21:20.809 --> 02:21:20.819 align:start position:0%
known because the feds didn't get any
 
02:21:23.809 --> 02:21:23.819 align:start position:0%
money to us at all until now in fact we
 
02:21:25.010 --> 02:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
still haven't gotten any money to
 
02:21:26.690 --> 02:21:26.700 align:start position:0%
address and pox at all so we were able
 
02:21:29.210 --> 02:21:29.220 align:start position:0%
to use this to activate some of our
 
02:21:29.220 --> 02:21:30.710 align:start position:0%
to use this to activate some of our
partners

02:21:30.710 --> 02:21:30.720 align:start position:0%
partners
 
02:21:32.270 --> 02:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
um and then finally again we have
 
02:21:35.510 --> 02:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
radiological emergency response where we
 
02:21:36.950 --> 02:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
use funds
 
02:21:39.889 --> 02:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
um from Seabrook in some cases to make
 
02:21:41.389 --> 02:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
sure that we're ready in case there's
 
02:21:42.710 --> 02:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
something bad
 
02:21:42.720 --> 02:21:44.090 align:start position:0%
something bad
there

02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:21:47.330 --> 02:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
so I want to I want to pick at the
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
public health emergency preparedness on
 
02:21:53.090 --> 02:21:53.100 align:start position:0%
on budget book 1001
 
02:21:58.849 --> 02:21:58.859 align:start position:0%
I I I see that of the 6 million 90 of it
 
02:22:03.530 --> 02:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
is federal generally yes are is our 500
 
02:22:06.590 --> 02:22:06.600 align:start position:0%
000 is that uh mandated mandated match
 
02:22:09.110 --> 02:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
is that a minimum level of effort is
 
02:22:11.330 --> 02:22:11.340 align:start position:0%
that a it's a mandated match and and
 
02:22:14.510 --> 02:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's a 10 percent match ten percent
 
02:22:18.290 --> 02:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
all right and so
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
is there is there an upper limit to what
 
02:22:23.270 --> 02:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
they're willing to match if we if we put
 
02:22:25.550 --> 02:22:25.560 align:start position:0%
another 100 000 in there would they
 
02:22:28.490 --> 02:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
increase we would all be very happy I'm
 
02:22:29.570 --> 02:22:29.580 align:start position:0%
not particularly concerned about what
 
02:22:31.190 --> 02:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying we would do it I'm just
 
02:22:33.170 --> 02:22:33.180 align:start position:0%
asking I I'm not saying that you would
 
02:22:34.670 --> 02:22:34.680 align:start position:0%
do it either it would be incredibly
 
02:22:36.590 --> 02:22:36.600 align:start position:0%
helpful this is a place where we
 
02:22:39.170 --> 02:22:39.180 align:start position:0%
actually run up against our
 
02:22:40.849 --> 02:22:40.859 align:start position:0%
um our federal grants it looks like
 
02:22:42.290 --> 02:22:42.300 align:start position:0%
there's lots of money in there but
 
02:22:44.510 --> 02:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
things like laboratory reagents things
 
02:22:47.570 --> 02:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
like that are fairly expensive and so um
 
02:22:49.190 --> 02:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
this is a place where we're counting
 
02:22:51.590 --> 02:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
pennies to to cover all our bases so
 
02:22:53.630 --> 02:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
it's just 23 people that just seems like
 
02:22:55.130 --> 02:22:55.140 align:start position:0%
a whole lot of people to me having
 
02:22:58.309 --> 02:22:58.319 align:start position:0%
worked in emergency response before so
 
02:23:00.530 --> 02:23:00.540 align:start position:0%
so it's across a broad range of
 
02:23:01.969 --> 02:23:01.979 align:start position:0%
activities so these include people in
 
02:23:03.770 --> 02:23:03.780 align:start position:0%
our infectious disease program that are
 
02:23:06.349 --> 02:23:06.359 align:start position:0%
ready to be activated so it pays for
 
02:23:07.849 --> 02:23:07.859 align:start position:0%
some nurses it pays for people in the
 
02:23:09.889 --> 02:23:09.899 align:start position:0%
laboratory it also pays for the people
 
02:23:12.889 --> 02:23:12.899 align:start position:0%
who are true like emergency planners so
 
02:23:15.530 --> 02:23:15.540 align:start position:0%
it's both doers and planners
 
02:23:15.540 --> 02:23:17.210 align:start position:0%
it's both doers and planners
representable

02:23:17.210 --> 02:23:17.220 align:start position:0%
representable
 
02:23:18.830 --> 02:23:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:23:21.770 --> 02:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
so back to my earlier discussion on
 
02:23:24.889 --> 02:23:24.899 align:start position:0%
rents leases Etc right this line is
 
02:23:28.250 --> 02:23:28.260 align:start position:0%
almost zeroed out relative to this is
 
02:23:31.010 --> 02:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
is this space covered somewhere else or
 
02:23:34.849 --> 02:23:34.859 align:start position:0%
is there a way for us to move over to
 
02:23:34.859 --> 02:23:35.750 align:start position:0%
is there a way for us to move over to
this

02:23:35.750 --> 02:23:35.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:23:38.929 --> 02:23:38.939 align:start position:0%
to this fund right some of some portion
 
02:23:38.939 --> 02:23:39.950 align:start position:0%
to this fund right some of some portion
of

02:23:39.950 --> 02:23:39.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:23:42.650 --> 02:23:42.660 align:start position:0%
base at Haze and drive so it's better
 
02:23:45.530 --> 02:23:45.540 align:start position:0%
covered from the federal side so so the
 
02:23:47.090 --> 02:23:47.100 align:start position:0%
rents leases
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
um that it was uh 500 each year
 
02:23:52.490 --> 02:23:52.500 align:start position:0%
right that doesn't cover much space for
 
02:23:55.370 --> 02:23:55.380 align:start position:0%
23 people so I'm I'm wondering whether
 
02:23:57.830 --> 02:23:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's a way to do that I I I don't
 
02:23:59.750 --> 02:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
believe that that is renting any
 
02:24:02.870 --> 02:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
building I think it's something smaller
 
02:24:05.450 --> 02:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
it's photocopier
 
02:24:10.490 --> 02:24:10.500 align:start position:0%
we do 500. okay so so so kind of along
 
02:24:12.349 --> 02:24:12.359 align:start position:0%
the lines were representative Edwards
 
02:24:13.910 --> 02:24:13.920 align:start position:0%
was going right
 
02:24:15.710 --> 02:24:15.720 align:start position:0%
is this a place where we would be
 
02:24:19.849 --> 02:24:19.859 align:start position:0%
prudent to actually incr incur a cost in
 
02:24:22.190 --> 02:24:22.200 align:start position:0%
terms of least rented space that's
 
02:24:24.110 --> 02:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
currently covered elsewhere in DHHS
 
02:24:25.670 --> 02:24:25.680 align:start position:0%
somewhere these 23 people have to be
 
02:24:28.370 --> 02:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
working and then build it back through
 
02:24:30.290 --> 02:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
this department so there is a match so
 
02:24:34.389 --> 02:24:34.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:38.270 --> 02:24:38.280 align:start position:0%
so you don't necessarily see things like
 
02:24:40.130 --> 02:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
that here we we have a a public
 
02:24:42.830 --> 02:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
assistance cost allocation plan that
 
02:24:44.870 --> 02:24:44.880 align:start position:0%
that we utilize internally it's a
 
02:24:46.490 --> 02:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
several hundred page document it's it's
 
02:24:48.650 --> 02:24:48.660 align:start position:0%
reviewed by the feds and approves and
 
02:24:50.570 --> 02:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
and we have a system in place where we
 
02:24:52.130 --> 02:24:52.140 align:start position:0%
leverage all those federal dollars so
 
02:24:54.770 --> 02:24:54.780 align:start position:0%
you heard me talk earlier last week
 
02:24:57.050 --> 02:24:57.060 align:start position:0%
about our new business intelligence
 
02:24:59.330 --> 02:24:59.340 align:start position:0%
system that we've been working on so
 
02:25:01.250 --> 02:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
that with a couple of the clicks of a
 
02:25:04.790 --> 02:25:04.800 align:start position:0%
button that I can quickly show you every
 
02:25:06.889 --> 02:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
account that's paid for out of the out
 
02:25:08.870 --> 02:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
of a particular Federal fund you know
 
02:25:11.510 --> 02:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
Federal fund or or series of them and so
 
02:25:14.450 --> 02:25:14.460 align:start position:0%
in that Central account where we have
 
02:25:17.270 --> 02:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
those those rents leases
 
02:25:20.030 --> 02:25:20.040 align:start position:0%
um included we we are leveraging as many
 
02:25:23.349 --> 02:25:23.359 align:start position:0%
federal dollars as we possibly can
 
02:25:25.250 --> 02:25:25.260 align:start position:0%
representative walner did you have a
 
02:25:25.260 --> 02:25:27.110 align:start position:0%
representative walner did you have a
question

02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:25:29.690 --> 02:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
so I just wanted to follow up on a
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
question that you had about
 
02:25:33.469 --> 02:25:33.479 align:start position:0%
um the match
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
are there additional federal dollars
 
02:25:39.290 --> 02:25:39.300 align:start position:0%
available if we add more match not to my
 
02:25:44.090 --> 02:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:44.100 --> 02:25:45.650 align:start position:0%
 
great

02:25:45.650 --> 02:25:45.660 align:start position:0%
great
 
02:25:48.230 --> 02:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um so slide 39 just gives you
 
02:25:49.730 --> 02:25:49.740 align:start position:0%
a high level overview of some of the
 
02:25:51.309 --> 02:25:51.319 align:start position:0%
things that we do within here around
 
02:25:53.750 --> 02:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
functioning you know we work
 
02:25:55.370 --> 02:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
um also very closely with Homeland
 
02:25:58.130 --> 02:25:58.140 align:start position:0%
Security we are responsible for esf8
 
02:26:00.590 --> 02:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
which is the housing and the health
 
02:26:02.690 --> 02:26:02.700 align:start position:0%
um component health and medical
 
02:26:05.630 --> 02:26:05.640 align:start position:0%
um as well as ESF at six which is the
 
02:26:07.610 --> 02:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
housing components in the homeland
 
02:26:09.590 --> 02:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
security structure
 
02:26:11.809 --> 02:26:11.819 align:start position:0%
um this does we do you know in good time
 
02:26:13.790 --> 02:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
we've had nothing but training and real
 
02:26:15.590 --> 02:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
work over the pandemic we've done all
 
02:26:17.090 --> 02:26:17.100 align:start position:0%
this work but someday when we're not
 
02:26:18.710 --> 02:26:18.720 align:start position:0%
actually doing the work of responding to
 
02:26:20.330 --> 02:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
an emergency we will get back to
 
02:26:21.770 --> 02:26:21.780 align:start position:0%
training for when there is a different
 
02:26:24.710 --> 02:26:24.720 align:start position:0%
emergency it also covers things like rep
 
02:26:26.630 --> 02:26:26.640 align:start position:0%
which is the radiological training which
 
02:26:28.610 --> 02:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
we do every year as well because again
 
02:26:30.770 --> 02:26:30.780 align:start position:0%
no one wants um we want to be prepared
 
02:26:34.610 --> 02:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:39.770 --> 02:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
um slide 40 puts us into our last Bureau
 
02:26:41.809 --> 02:26:41.819 align:start position:0%
um which is great I think we've flown
 
02:26:43.370 --> 02:26:43.380 align:start position:0%
right through here
 
02:26:44.870 --> 02:26:44.880 align:start position:0%
um maybe flown isn't the word this is
 
02:26:46.670 --> 02:26:46.680 align:start position:0%
our Bureau Bureau of prevention and
 
02:26:48.650 --> 02:26:48.660 align:start position:0%
wellness again we broke out our
 
02:26:50.270 --> 02:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
population and Community Health Services
 
02:26:53.030 --> 02:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
to that family side this is the chronic
 
02:26:56.030 --> 02:26:56.040 align:start position:0%
disease side and prevention side we have
 
02:26:58.309 --> 02:26:58.319 align:start position:0%
a number of federal grants in here this
 
02:27:00.950 --> 02:27:00.960 align:start position:0%
in fact most of this Bureau is 100
 
02:27:03.590 --> 02:27:03.600 align:start position:0%
federally funded big big chunks or
 
02:27:06.110 --> 02:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
chunks of federal dollars not as much
 
02:27:10.130 --> 02:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
General funds and you can see through
 
02:27:14.750 --> 02:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
um slides 40 and 41 the content area so
 
02:27:16.910 --> 02:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
I have a couple questions around the
 
02:27:21.250 --> 02:27:21.260 align:start position:0%
tobacco prevention on pages
 
02:27:26.630 --> 02:27:26.640 align:start position:0%
178 but on 1008 there's like a million
 
02:27:30.070 --> 02:27:30.080 align:start position:0%
dollars of federal money and 600 000 in
 
02:27:33.530 --> 02:27:33.540 align:start position:0%
state funds is is there a match in there
 
02:27:35.809 --> 02:27:35.819 align:start position:0%
yeah these were those were six hundred
 
02:27:38.630 --> 02:27:38.640 align:start position:0%
thousand that was dedicated to Tobacco
 
02:27:40.670 --> 02:27:40.680 align:start position:0%
prevention several bienniums ago and we
 
02:27:42.230 --> 02:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
have maintained that and we use this
 
02:27:44.570 --> 02:27:44.580 align:start position:0%
primarily for a lot of our Outreach uh
 
02:27:47.150 --> 02:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
to adolescents that the These funds were
 
02:27:49.190 --> 02:27:49.200 align:start position:0%
specifically put in several years ago to
 
02:27:51.889 --> 02:27:51.899 align:start position:0%
address vaping one of the best news
 
02:27:54.710 --> 02:27:54.720 align:start position:0%
stories uh is we've you know uh is we've
 
02:27:56.389 --> 02:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
actually seen that number come down we
 
02:27:58.370 --> 02:27:58.380 align:start position:0%
were at some point at ridiculously high
 
02:28:00.170 --> 02:28:00.180 align:start position:0%
rates in high school we're starting to
 
02:28:03.410 --> 02:28:03.420 align:start position:0%
see that come down okay so the this is
 
02:28:06.469 --> 02:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
level positions at five we're continuing
 
02:28:08.929 --> 02:28:08.939 align:start position:0%
five and then there's a fairly
 
02:28:11.270 --> 02:28:11.280 align:start position:0%
significant jump in uh the federal
 
02:28:14.870 --> 02:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
dollars for this uh 150 000 on that base
 
02:28:17.210 --> 02:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
is pretty substantial what what what
 
02:28:19.309 --> 02:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
what do they think they're getting for
 
02:28:21.830 --> 02:28:21.840 align:start position:0%
that extra do we know why they're
 
02:28:29.110 --> 02:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:32.090 --> 02:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
so you see what I'm saying it's it's a
 
02:28:36.050 --> 02:28:36.060 align:start position:0%
date uh you oh wait now in 22 it was
 
02:28:39.349 --> 02:28:39.359 align:start position:0%
over a million and so compared to 22
 
02:28:41.809 --> 02:28:41.819 align:start position:0%
it's about the same I let myself look at
 
02:28:43.610 --> 02:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
23 for a second
 
02:28:45.830 --> 02:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
all right so let me ask you a different
 
02:28:45.840 --> 02:28:47.150 align:start position:0%
all right so let me ask you a different
question

02:28:47.150 --> 02:28:47.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:28:47.160 --> 02:28:48.410 align:start position:0%
question
um

02:28:48.410 --> 02:28:48.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:28:50.870 --> 02:28:50.880 align:start position:0%
what are our metrics this is one of the
 
02:28:52.969 --> 02:28:52.979 align:start position:0%
programs that has bugged me because I've
 
02:28:54.889 --> 02:28:54.899 align:start position:0%
talked to predecessors of mine who've
 
02:28:56.750 --> 02:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
been say they've been asking this for
 
02:28:59.270 --> 02:28:59.280 align:start position:0%
years and years and years
 
02:29:01.370 --> 02:29:01.380 align:start position:0%
what are the metrics to know that this
 
02:29:03.170 --> 02:29:03.180 align:start position:0%
program is worthwhile
 
02:29:04.849 --> 02:29:04.859 align:start position:0%
sure so one of them is really
 
02:29:07.010 --> 02:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
utilization of the Quit Line that we do
 
02:29:09.710 --> 02:29:09.720 align:start position:0%
so and one of the things that we've done
 
02:29:12.349 --> 02:29:12.359 align:start position:0%
and I don't know exactly the percentages
 
02:29:14.570 --> 02:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
of this between General and federal but
 
02:29:17.450 --> 02:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
we've added additional supports just for
 
02:29:20.210 --> 02:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
adolescents because the way in which you
 
02:29:22.309 --> 02:29:22.319 align:start position:0%
need coaching to stop your tobacco
 
02:29:24.290 --> 02:29:24.300 align:start position:0%
dependence it looks very different if
 
02:29:26.210 --> 02:29:26.220 align:start position:0%
you're a 55 year old woman who smoked
 
02:29:29.150 --> 02:29:29.160 align:start position:0%
for 30 years versus a 18 year old who's
 
02:29:31.130 --> 02:29:31.140 align:start position:0%
been vaping so we've differentiated that
 
02:29:34.490 --> 02:29:34.500 align:start position:0%
way so the metrics around uptake we also
 
02:29:35.870 --> 02:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
are looking at and you can see this in
 
02:29:37.250 --> 02:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
the budget briefing book if you want to
 
02:29:39.410 --> 02:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
look at we are focusing on certain
 
02:29:39.420 --> 02:29:40.570 align:start position:0%
look at we are focusing on certain
populations

02:29:40.570 --> 02:29:40.580 align:start position:0%
populations
 
02:29:43.130 --> 02:29:43.140 align:start position:0%
specifically folks who have behavioral
 
02:29:45.130 --> 02:29:45.140 align:start position:0%
health issues we know that they smoke it
 
02:29:47.389 --> 02:29:47.399 align:start position:0%
disproportionately higher levels so
 
02:29:50.150 --> 02:29:50.160 align:start position:0%
we're working with those with Community
 
02:29:52.370 --> 02:29:52.380 align:start position:0%
Mental Health Centers to try and see how
 
02:29:54.950 --> 02:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
we can reduce the number of active
 
02:29:58.309 --> 02:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
smokers in those populations that's just
 
02:30:00.889 --> 02:30:00.899 align:start position:0%
a couple examples
 
02:30:03.410 --> 02:30:03.420 align:start position:0%
to do do we know that there's a
 
02:30:05.690 --> 02:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
correlation between the money we spend
 
02:30:08.389 --> 02:30:08.399 align:start position:0%
in this program and actual changes in
 
02:30:11.270 --> 02:30:11.280 align:start position:0%
Behavior or are we doing that on gut
 
02:30:11.280 --> 02:30:13.849 align:start position:0%
Behavior or are we doing that on gut
instinct

02:30:13.849 --> 02:30:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:15.530 --> 02:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
you know I think that's the problem with
 
02:30:17.750 --> 02:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
all Prevention Services it's very hard
 
02:30:19.969 --> 02:30:19.979 align:start position:0%
to draw an absolute straight line which
 
02:30:21.530 --> 02:30:21.540 align:start position:0%
is why we measure both process and
 
02:30:24.349 --> 02:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
outcome so we measure we can measure how
 
02:30:26.210 --> 02:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
many people particip you know go to the
 
02:30:28.429 --> 02:30:28.439 align:start position:0%
Quit Line that's a hard number we know
 
02:30:30.469 --> 02:30:30.479 align:start position:0%
that we pushed that number we did that
 
02:30:32.450 --> 02:30:32.460 align:start position:0%
through work through advertising but
 
02:30:34.010 --> 02:30:34.020 align:start position:0%
quite frankly the best way to get that
 
02:30:36.110 --> 02:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
is to work with our clinical Partners to
 
02:30:37.550 --> 02:30:37.560 align:start position:0%
make sure that they've got it built into
 
02:30:39.770 --> 02:30:39.780 align:start position:0%
their emrs that if someone comes in as a
 
02:30:41.510 --> 02:30:41.520 align:start position:0%
smoker they go through there's some
 
02:30:43.550 --> 02:30:43.560 align:start position:0%
evidence base around how you get people
 
02:30:45.710 --> 02:30:45.720 align:start position:0%
to you know the theories of change of
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
how you think about stopping smoking and
 
02:30:50.570 --> 02:30:50.580 align:start position:0%
that we can help people where they are
 
02:30:52.849 --> 02:30:52.859 align:start position:0%
and eventually move them into an
 
02:30:55.550 --> 02:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
evidence-based quit program we know the
 
02:30:57.410 --> 02:30:57.420 align:start position:0%
expenses for tobacco use are
 
02:30:59.389 --> 02:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
extraordinary you know when we think
 
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
about all health care we talk about
 
02:31:02.690 --> 02:31:02.700 align:start position:0%
cancer we talk about heart disease talk
 
02:31:05.330 --> 02:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
about asthma COPD emphysema all those
 
02:31:07.670 --> 02:31:07.680 align:start position:0%
costs are on the way end you know way
 
02:31:08.929 --> 02:31:08.939 align:start position:0%
back end you're going to get that in
 
02:31:10.309 --> 02:31:10.319 align:start position:0%
long-term care you're going to get that
 
02:31:13.130 --> 02:31:13.140 align:start position:0%
in in Medicare costs so it's hard for us
 
02:31:15.950 --> 02:31:15.960 align:start position:0%
to to show show that but we do know that
 
02:31:17.809 --> 02:31:17.819 align:start position:0%
if you start smoking for example before
 
02:31:19.969 --> 02:31:19.979 align:start position:0%
you know as a teen you're much likely to
 
02:31:21.290 --> 02:31:21.300 align:start position:0%
keep smoking for the rest of your life
 
02:31:23.150 --> 02:31:23.160 align:start position:0%
so I believe all of that I'm just still
 
02:31:25.550 --> 02:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
looking to see if there's a causation so
 
02:31:27.290 --> 02:31:27.300 align:start position:0%
so I'm going to tell you a 30-second
 
02:31:29.210 --> 02:31:29.220 align:start position:0%
story of why I have animus towards this
 
02:31:29.220 --> 02:31:30.710 align:start position:0%
story of why I have animus towards this
program

02:31:30.710 --> 02:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
program
 
02:31:31.969 --> 02:31:31.979 align:start position:0%
um I got
 
02:31:35.030 --> 02:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
two years ago I got a call from a mom
 
02:31:37.670 --> 02:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
and she was telling me how vital this
 
02:31:40.910 --> 02:31:40.920 align:start position:0%
program was to keep her son from smoking
 
02:31:43.490 --> 02:31:43.500 align:start position:0%
and since there was a hiccup or
 
02:31:44.990 --> 02:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
something A disruption in the program
 
02:31:47.210 --> 02:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
she said that her son had started
 
02:31:49.610 --> 02:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
smoking so she was saying that this
 
02:31:51.889 --> 02:31:51.899 align:start position:0%
program would have been vital but it
 
02:31:53.929 --> 02:31:53.939 align:start position:0%
wasn't available so when I kept talking
 
02:31:56.230 --> 02:31:56.240 align:start position:0%
to her she was an RN at one of our
 
02:31:59.210 --> 02:31:59.220 align:start position:0%
academies our academic academies up
 
02:32:02.389 --> 02:32:02.399 align:start position:0%
north and her job was to to take care of
 
02:32:04.309 --> 02:32:04.319 align:start position:0%
the health of all of those young
 
02:32:04.319 --> 02:32:06.230 align:start position:0%
the health of all of those young
students

02:32:06.230 --> 02:32:06.240 align:start position:0%
students
 
02:32:09.950 --> 02:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
but she couldn't control her own son she
 
02:32:12.170 --> 02:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
said that the government program was
 
02:32:14.590 --> 02:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
essential for her to have an effective
 
02:32:16.910 --> 02:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
relationship with her with her own
 
02:32:19.070 --> 02:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
family and that's the point where I
 
02:32:21.290 --> 02:32:21.300 align:start position:0%
thought oh my God is this government
 
02:32:25.969 --> 02:32:25.979 align:start position:0%
program replacing parenting or or
 
02:32:28.010 --> 02:32:28.020 align:start position:0%
government programs never replace
 
02:32:30.230 --> 02:32:30.240 align:start position:0%
parenting but they do provide help
 
02:32:32.330 --> 02:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
provide the conditions to make parenting
 
02:32:34.670 --> 02:32:34.680 align:start position:0%
easier so it's the reason why we have
 
02:32:37.070 --> 02:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
policies that you cannot lawfully
 
02:32:38.630 --> 02:32:38.640 align:start position:0%
purchase cigarettes until you're 18
 
02:32:41.270 --> 02:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
years old that's part of you know that's
 
02:32:44.330 --> 02:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
a policy that this and this entity has
 
02:32:46.730 --> 02:32:46.740 align:start position:0%
put in place because we know that if you
 
02:32:48.349 --> 02:32:48.359 align:start position:0%
start smoking when you're younger we
 
02:32:50.690 --> 02:32:50.700 align:start position:0%
know younger people than 18 have smoked
 
02:32:52.550 --> 02:32:52.560 align:start position:0%
but we've essentially made it harder for
 
02:32:54.349 --> 02:32:54.359 align:start position:0%
them to do that and that's the sort of
 
02:32:56.030 --> 02:32:56.040 align:start position:0%
thing that I think this program does is
 
02:32:58.429 --> 02:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
it changes some social norms
 
02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
um especially around the work what we've
 
02:33:02.690 --> 02:33:02.700 align:start position:0%
done around vaping which is saying
 
02:33:05.330 --> 02:33:05.340 align:start position:0%
um you know big tobacco is lying to you
 
02:33:07.370 --> 02:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
you're going to be addicted this isn't
 
02:33:10.849 --> 02:33:10.859 align:start position:0%
you know vaping is has nicotine in it so
 
02:33:13.130 --> 02:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
it is addictive that's the sort of work
 
02:33:15.530 --> 02:33:15.540 align:start position:0%
that we do that sets the conditions to
 
02:33:17.330 --> 02:33:17.340 align:start position:0%
help make it easier for parents to do
 
02:33:19.849 --> 02:33:19.859 align:start position:0%
their job all right uh thank you
 
02:33:21.410 --> 02:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
02:33:23.510 --> 02:33:23.520 align:start position:0%
chairman would you anticipate an
 
02:33:25.490 --> 02:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
increase in this particular budget
 
02:33:28.330 --> 02:33:28.340 align:start position:0%
section if House Bill
 
02:33:31.730 --> 02:33:31.740 align:start position:0%
639 regulation and legalization of
 
02:33:34.670 --> 02:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis passes that's a really
 
02:33:36.830 --> 02:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
interesting question thank you
 
02:33:39.950 --> 02:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
um we know I I don't the answer is I
 
02:33:41.090 --> 02:33:41.100 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
02:33:44.389 --> 02:33:44.399 align:start position:0%
um we know things like vaping you know
 
02:33:46.490 --> 02:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
is normalized especially when you're
 
02:33:49.490 --> 02:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
vaping both cannabis as well as tobacco
 
02:33:52.370 --> 02:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
we want to minimize that to the best to
 
02:33:54.110 --> 02:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
our ability it's interesting to your
 
02:33:56.750 --> 02:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
point earlier representative Edwards we
 
02:33:58.730 --> 02:33:58.740 align:start position:0%
saw The Vaping numbers come down during
 
02:34:00.950 --> 02:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
the pandemic when more kids were at home
 
02:34:03.410 --> 02:34:03.420 align:start position:0%
more often which is of Interest I don't
 
02:34:04.790 --> 02:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
know that there's a correlation there
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
but it's interesting to see that as we
 
02:34:10.309 --> 02:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
have more access to a regulated
 
02:34:14.150 --> 02:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
commercial product of of cannabis it's
 
02:34:16.790 --> 02:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
hard you know we see that at we see that
 
02:34:18.830 --> 02:34:18.840 align:start position:0%
activity normalized in the how household
 
02:34:20.690 --> 02:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
much like when parents used to smoke
 
02:34:23.530 --> 02:34:23.540 align:start position:0%
kids used to smoke as well I imagine
 
02:34:26.090 --> 02:34:26.100 align:start position:0%
cannabis use in the home is going to
 
02:34:28.429 --> 02:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
drive use of other substances but I
 
02:34:30.490 --> 02:34:30.500 align:start position:0%
don't know that for sure
 
02:34:33.410 --> 02:34:33.420 align:start position:0%
representable thank you how do you know
 
02:34:35.929 --> 02:34:35.939 align:start position:0%
that the numbers dropped during covid
 
02:34:38.630 --> 02:34:38.640 align:start position:0%
I'm curious what the data set that is
 
02:34:40.429 --> 02:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
sure so we have something called the
 
02:34:42.770 --> 02:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
youth risk behavior survey
 
02:34:44.929 --> 02:34:44.939 align:start position:0%
um it's called yrbs it's a CDC runded
 
02:34:46.969 --> 02:34:46.979 align:start position:0%
survey it's done in our high schools and
 
02:34:50.030 --> 02:34:50.040 align:start position:0%
we have 2021 data that was just released
 
02:34:52.550 --> 02:34:52.560 align:start position:0%
and we have not released it by School
 
02:34:54.110 --> 02:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
District yet like it's hot off the
 
02:34:56.929 --> 02:34:56.939 align:start position:0%
presses and we saw that in 2021 there
 
02:34:59.510 --> 02:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
was a dip in vaping the other concerning
 
02:35:01.190 --> 02:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
thing was around the increase around
 
02:35:03.110 --> 02:35:03.120 align:start position:0%
some behavioral health issues that's
 
02:35:04.849 --> 02:35:04.859 align:start position:0%
what we've been hearing in the media the
 
02:35:06.349 --> 02:35:06.359 align:start position:0%
piece we're not hearing about yet
 
02:35:08.330 --> 02:35:08.340 align:start position:0%
certainly in New Hampshire is the dip in
 
02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
vaping and the dip of alcohol used to be
 
02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
so is there any correlation between that
 
02:35:16.670 --> 02:35:16.680 align:start position:0%
data and things like
 
02:35:16.680 --> 02:35:17.450 align:start position:0%
data and things like
um

02:35:17.450 --> 02:35:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:35:19.849 --> 02:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
sales through the establishments that
 
02:35:21.710 --> 02:35:21.720 align:start position:0%
are The Vaping sales in terms of gross
 
02:35:23.510 --> 02:35:23.520 align:start position:0%
revenue I mean I don't I
 
02:35:25.130 --> 02:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean it's hard
 
02:35:28.130 --> 02:35:28.140 align:start position:0%
and if you're under 18 you're buying
 
02:35:30.650 --> 02:35:30.660 align:start position:0%
that some illegally in some way whether
 
02:35:32.570 --> 02:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
someone else is buying it for you or
 
02:35:34.490 --> 02:35:34.500 align:start position:0%
you're not being carded when you go in
 
02:35:36.770 --> 02:35:36.780 align:start position:0%
there but I imagine that if you looked
 
02:35:38.630 --> 02:35:38.640 align:start position:0%
at the revenue you you might see that
 
02:35:41.270 --> 02:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
but you know the number of the 16 to 18
 
02:35:42.950 --> 02:35:42.960 align:start position:0%
year olds while it's important certainly
 
02:35:44.929 --> 02:35:44.939 align:start position:0%
isn't the full number of people who are
 
02:35:46.730 --> 02:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
vaping so you know more middle-aged
 
02:35:48.530 --> 02:35:48.540 align:start position:0%
people could have been vaping I'm just
 
02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the correlation and
 
02:35:51.590 --> 02:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
was it because they were home and they
 
02:35:54.469 --> 02:35:54.479 align:start position:0%
weren't with their peers their greater
 
02:35:56.870 --> 02:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
parental involvement or it is it
 
02:35:59.929 --> 02:35:59.939 align:start position:0%
supported by other things like sales of
 
02:36:01.849 --> 02:36:01.859 align:start position:0%
of vaping products I think that that's
 
02:36:04.070 --> 02:36:04.080 align:start position:0%
more that is information that we've yet
 
02:36:06.349 --> 02:36:06.359 align:start position:0%
to fully uncover and and look into it's
 
02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
a great line of inquiry that we just
 
02:36:10.309 --> 02:36:10.319 align:start position:0%
have not had the time yet to do since
 
02:36:11.870 --> 02:36:11.880 align:start position:0%
the data just came out we had been
 
02:36:14.030 --> 02:36:14.040 align:start position:0%
seeing you know a four-year pretty
 
02:36:14.040 --> 02:36:15.889 align:start position:0%
seeing you know a four-year pretty
markets

02:36:15.889 --> 02:36:15.899 align:start position:0%
markets
 
02:36:18.050 --> 02:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
um Trend upwards of teen vaping and
 
02:36:19.610 --> 02:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
we're now seeing it you know we're
 
02:36:22.010 --> 02:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
hoping we've gone over the hill and
 
02:36:23.210 --> 02:36:23.220 align:start position:0%
we're starting to go back in the right
 
02:36:25.190 --> 02:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
direction what's causing that we're
 
02:36:26.870 --> 02:36:26.880 align:start position:0%
we're gonna have to find out more again
 
02:36:29.389 --> 02:36:29.399 align:start position:0%
many of us can sort of imagine that kids
 
02:36:32.090 --> 02:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
were at home more and not with their
 
02:36:33.830 --> 02:36:33.840 align:start position:0%
peers but that's a conjecture I don't
 
02:36:36.650 --> 02:36:36.660 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:36.660 --> 02:36:39.889 align:start position:0%
 
done

02:36:39.889 --> 02:36:39.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:42.770 --> 02:36:42.780 align:start position:0%
um 42 and 43 slides 42 and 43 just tell
 
02:36:43.849 --> 02:36:43.859 align:start position:0%
you the great work that we've done
 
02:36:45.889 --> 02:36:45.899 align:start position:0%
around chronic disease worked with great
 
02:36:47.990 --> 02:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
Partners like the YMCA to do things like
 
02:36:50.210 --> 02:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
diabetes self-management great program
 
02:36:53.510 --> 02:36:53.520 align:start position:0%
under the radar that we do slide 43
 
02:36:55.370 --> 02:36:55.380 align:start position:0%
highlights some new work that we're
 
02:36:58.969 --> 02:36:58.979 align:start position:0%
doing with EMS in communities and
 
02:37:00.710 --> 02:37:00.720 align:start position:0%
hospitals called mobile Integrated
 
02:37:03.530 --> 02:37:03.540 align:start position:0%
Health where we're maximizing the use of
 
02:37:06.170 --> 02:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
EMS providers to be able to provide some
 
02:37:08.870 --> 02:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
care when after people come out of the
 
02:37:10.730 --> 02:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
emergency room for a chronic disease
 
02:37:12.950 --> 02:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
whether that was an asthma event or a
 
02:37:15.170 --> 02:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
diabetic event and that we're helping
 
02:37:16.849 --> 02:37:16.859 align:start position:0%
them with that self-management so that
 
02:37:18.950 --> 02:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
there are fewer readmissions this is
 
02:37:20.929 --> 02:37:20.939 align:start position:0%
really promising we've just started this
 
02:37:23.090 --> 02:37:23.100 align:start position:0%
work in this past year but it looks it
 
02:37:24.950 --> 02:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
looks great we're excited to see where
 
02:37:28.250 --> 02:37:28.260 align:start position:0%
it goes and then on slide 44 that's just
 
02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
our last final plea for some of those
 
02:37:33.469 --> 02:37:33.479 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs to support families so
 
02:37:35.090 --> 02:37:35.100 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
02:37:37.490 --> 02:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's it so wait a second you may you
 
02:37:40.490 --> 02:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
may have ended too quickly on 44. you're
 
02:37:42.950 --> 02:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
you're saying these are your PR your
 
02:37:45.770 --> 02:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
priority needs yeah why don't you why
 
02:37:47.270 --> 02:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
don't you just spend a moment to talk
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
through these what sure what what's
 
02:37:51.530 --> 02:37:51.540 align:start position:0%
going on here sure these are what these
 
02:37:53.570 --> 02:37:53.580 align:start position:0%
so as I noted we have three prioritized
 
02:37:54.889 --> 02:37:54.899 align:start position:0%
needs in public health one is the
 
02:37:57.110 --> 02:37:57.120 align:start position:0%
overtime for food I didn't add that
 
02:37:59.630 --> 02:37:59.640 align:start position:0%
there it feels technical in nature we
 
02:38:01.370 --> 02:38:01.380 align:start position:0%
just need an overtime line that's
 
02:38:03.830 --> 02:38:03.840 align:start position:0%
manageable for food protection what
 
02:38:05.929 --> 02:38:05.939 align:start position:0%
slide 44 really talks about is the
 
02:38:08.030 --> 02:38:08.040 align:start position:0%
combination of both home visiting and
 
02:38:10.429 --> 02:38:10.439 align:start position:0%
and WIC these are places where we put
 
02:38:12.770 --> 02:38:12.780 align:start position:0%
interventions with families that are
 
02:38:14.570 --> 02:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
most at need at really vulnerable times
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
we know um if we think about WIC we've
 
02:38:21.170 --> 02:38:21.180 align:start position:0%
got going to see the unwind as um I'm
 
02:38:23.150 --> 02:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
sure director lippman has talked about
 
02:38:25.429 --> 02:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
and and other folks at
 
02:38:28.010 --> 02:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
um around the fewer SNAP benefits that
 
02:38:29.230 --> 02:38:29.240 align:start position:0%
are going to be available to families
 
02:38:33.050 --> 02:38:33.060 align:start position:0%
fewer other hard concrete supports we
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
know that WIC is going to be more
 
02:38:36.469 --> 02:38:36.479 align:start position:0%
important now well certainly than it was
 
02:38:39.170 --> 02:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
in the past few years and so we want to
 
02:38:40.730 --> 02:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
make sure that we have the opportunity
 
02:38:43.070 --> 02:38:43.080 align:start position:0%
that not only can they use their WIC
 
02:38:44.990 --> 02:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
benefit as it is right now for the
 
02:38:47.510 --> 02:38:47.520 align:start position:0%
grocery store but that we could have an
 
02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
opportunity for them to leverage
 
02:38:51.530 --> 02:38:51.540 align:start position:0%
additional federal dollars to have extra
 
02:38:53.270 --> 02:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
access to fresh fruits and veggies
 
02:38:55.670 --> 02:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
through farmer's market so so I'm not
 
02:38:57.889 --> 02:38:57.899 align:start position:0%
seeing dollar amounts yeah do you have
 
02:39:00.590 --> 02:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
uh intended targets that you'd like us
 
02:39:02.690 --> 02:39:02.700 align:start position:0%
to consider and how will we know what
 
02:39:04.190 --> 02:39:04.200 align:start position:0%
those numbers are the original
 
02:39:05.990 --> 02:39:06.000 align:start position:0%
prioritize needs that we that we
 
02:39:07.670 --> 02:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
submitted it was three hundred thousand
 
02:39:09.650 --> 02:39:09.660 align:start position:0%
dollars of General funds in state fiscal
 
02:39:12.170 --> 02:39:12.180 align:start position:0%
year 24 and 300 000 in state fiscal year
 
02:39:15.230 --> 02:39:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:17.270 --> 02:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
asking for is less than the original
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
request which was 1.25 million we're
 
02:39:26.090 --> 02:39:26.100 align:start position:0%
down to 5.25 K 525k per year because we
 
02:39:27.590 --> 02:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
found we have better numbers to work
 
02:39:29.690 --> 02:39:29.700 align:start position:0%
with now and then
 
02:39:32.809 --> 02:39:32.819 align:start position:0%
um just the 20 25 000 in overtime those
 
02:39:35.330 --> 02:39:35.340 align:start position:0%
are the three dollar figures okay and I
 
02:39:37.910 --> 02:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
noticed on page 40 that we have a wise
 
02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:40.080 align:start position:0%
woman program and I'm just wondering can
 
02:39:43.190 --> 02:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
we find no wise men anywhere
 
02:39:46.270 --> 02:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
a sexist would say
 
02:39:48.650 --> 02:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
representative Paul thank you chairman
 
02:39:48.660 --> 02:39:50.389 align:start position:0%
representative Paul thank you chairman
so

02:39:50.389 --> 02:39:50.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:50.399 --> 02:39:51.830 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:55.309 --> 02:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
I'm looking my background is in is in
 
02:39:58.130 --> 02:39:58.140 align:start position:0%
the medical diabetic domain so I'm
 
02:40:00.230 --> 02:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
hypersensitive to that
 
02:40:01.969 --> 02:40:01.979 align:start position:0%
um that field
 
02:40:01.979 --> 02:40:04.309 align:start position:0%
um that field
and

02:40:04.309 --> 02:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:40:07.490 --> 02:40:07.500 align:start position:0%
in watching the how covid played out
 
02:40:09.830 --> 02:40:09.840 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a number of patients did
 
02:40:09.840 --> 02:40:10.550 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a number of patients did
not

02:40:10.550 --> 02:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:40:13.070 --> 02:40:13.080 align:start position:0%
handle covered well one and didn't make
 
02:40:16.990 --> 02:40:17.000 align:start position:0%
it throw but we have seen long coveted
 
02:40:20.570 --> 02:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
impacting the endocrine system impacting
 
02:40:22.849 --> 02:40:22.859 align:start position:0%
people pushing them into the diabetic
 
02:40:25.730 --> 02:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
the secondary diabetic market right for
 
02:40:29.450 --> 02:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
either hemo or peritoneal dialysis
 
02:40:31.610 --> 02:40:31.620 align:start position:0%
how do we get ahead of this and start
 
02:40:33.230 --> 02:40:33.240 align:start position:0%
talking about the importance of vitamin
 
02:40:36.170 --> 02:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
D maybe I was naive but I did not
 
02:40:38.270 --> 02:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
realize and I would consider myself
 
02:40:42.050 --> 02:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
rather well read how valuable vitamin D
 
02:40:45.650 --> 02:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
was to address and help prevent some of
 
02:40:48.290 --> 02:40:48.300 align:start position:0%
the side effects both long covid
 
02:40:49.910 --> 02:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
as well the other things how do we get
 
02:40:52.130 --> 02:40:52.140 align:start position:0%
ahead of that now in terms of a budget
 
02:40:52.140 --> 02:40:53.270 align:start position:0%
ahead of that now in terms of a budget
priority

02:40:53.270 --> 02:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
priority
 
02:40:56.870 --> 02:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
most people are vitamin D deficient
 
02:40:58.969 --> 02:40:58.979 align:start position:0%
we can't do anything we're at the 40th
 
02:41:01.210 --> 02:41:01.220 align:start position:0%
latitude Mark right we
 
02:41:03.950 --> 02:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
half the year we don't have Sun
 
02:41:03.960 --> 02:41:04.490 align:start position:0%
half the year we don't have Sun
um

02:41:04.490 --> 02:41:04.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:07.250 --> 02:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
so how do we start what can the
 
02:41:09.410 --> 02:41:09.420 align:start position:0%
department do to better prepare our
 
02:41:11.150 --> 02:41:11.160 align:start position:0%
citizens because
 
02:41:13.309 --> 02:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
yes we used to drink lots of vitamin D
 
02:41:15.050 --> 02:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
infused milk guess what like people
 
02:41:16.429 --> 02:41:16.439 align:start position:0%
aren't drinking as much Dairy anymore
 
02:41:17.990 --> 02:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
right especially when you get to the
 
02:41:20.990 --> 02:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
older populations so there is no place
 
02:41:24.650 --> 02:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
to write in their their typical diet to
 
02:41:27.050 --> 02:41:27.060 align:start position:0%
deal with this yet it's hyper it is
 
02:41:29.450 --> 02:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
really crucial to weathering various
 
02:41:32.389 --> 02:41:32.399 align:start position:0%
where various viruses
 
02:41:34.370 --> 02:41:34.380 align:start position:0%
what can you do as a department and how
 
02:41:36.290 --> 02:41:36.300 align:start position:0%
do we make sure that happens sure so I
 
02:41:39.110 --> 02:41:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:41.450 --> 02:41:41.460 align:start position:0%
with now we work closely again with
 
02:41:42.710 --> 02:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
Partners like you see on C on the slide
 
02:41:45.290 --> 02:41:45.300 align:start position:0%
with YMCA Granite YMCA to really focus
 
02:41:47.929 --> 02:41:47.939 align:start position:0%
focus on diabetes self-management
 
02:41:50.270 --> 02:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
um and in that is a focus on nutrition
 
02:41:52.070 --> 02:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
and so I think that's a place that we
 
02:41:54.950 --> 02:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
can add additional information and
 
02:41:56.690 --> 02:41:56.700 align:start position:0%
supporters around nutrition as well as
 
02:41:58.610 --> 02:41:58.620 align:start position:0%
physical movement you know those are the
 
02:42:00.469 --> 02:42:00.479 align:start position:0%
areas that we know regardless you know
 
02:42:02.030 --> 02:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
certainly for pre uh whether you're
 
02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
pre-diabetes straight into whether you
 
02:42:06.170 --> 02:42:06.180 align:start position:0%
have more advanced disease we know that
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
just taking care of those two things
 
02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
getting nutrition under control and
 
02:42:11.510 --> 02:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
getting your physical activity under
 
02:42:13.910 --> 02:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
control we can help create better
 
02:42:15.770 --> 02:42:15.780 align:start position:0%
outcomes of the long in the long term so
 
02:42:17.330 --> 02:42:17.340 align:start position:0%
I think that that's a place that we can
 
02:42:20.210 --> 02:42:20.220 align:start position:0%
provide additional information we're
 
02:42:21.770 --> 02:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
certainly going to always look to CDC
 
02:42:23.870 --> 02:42:23.880 align:start position:0%
and to our other clinical partners and
 
02:42:25.250 --> 02:42:25.260 align:start position:0%
you know I know just enough to be
 
02:42:27.050 --> 02:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
dangerous but certainly
 
02:42:29.150 --> 02:42:29.160 align:start position:0%
um you know Dr Ballard and Dr Chan help
 
02:42:33.170 --> 02:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
us in those spaces but nutrition is of
 
02:42:35.450 --> 02:42:35.460 align:start position:0%
Paramount concern and we do that through
 
02:42:35.460 --> 02:42:36.550 align:start position:0%
Paramount concern and we do that through
these

02:42:36.550 --> 02:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
these
 
02:42:39.650 --> 02:42:39.660 align:start position:0%
localized self-management programs that
 
02:42:41.690 --> 02:42:41.700 align:start position:0%
have local have coaches to help people
 
02:42:43.270 --> 02:42:43.280 align:start position:0%
to work through through their own
 
02:42:46.370 --> 02:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
individual issues
 
02:42:49.910 --> 02:42:49.920 align:start position:0%
thank you representative a question no
 
02:42:52.490 --> 02:42:52.500 align:start position:0%
no representative solorski thank you Mr
 
02:42:53.630 --> 02:42:53.640 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:42:53.640 --> 02:42:54.530 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you for taking my
question

02:42:54.530 --> 02:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:42:57.230 --> 02:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
um when you referred to three hundred
 
02:42:59.809 --> 02:42:59.819 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to meet a priority need
 
02:43:02.150 --> 02:43:02.160 align:start position:0%
was that the nutrition ask yes that is
 
02:43:04.010 --> 02:43:04.020 align:start position:0%
the nutritionist okay thank you a quick
 
02:43:04.020 --> 02:43:05.030 align:start position:0%
the nutritionist okay thank you a quick
follow-up

02:43:05.030 --> 02:43:05.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
02:43:07.610 --> 02:43:07.620 align:start position:0%
um there was a bill that I believe was
 
02:43:08.929 --> 02:43:08.939 align:start position:0%
defeated last week I just was
 
02:43:10.730 --> 02:43:10.740 align:start position:0%
frantically looking on my phone to find
 
02:43:11.929 --> 02:43:11.939 align:start position:0%
the number
 
02:43:13.309 --> 02:43:13.319 align:start position:0%
um but I believe it had to do with
 
02:43:16.690 --> 02:43:16.700 align:start position:0%
expanding WIC access to farmers markets
 
02:43:19.610 --> 02:43:19.620 align:start position:0%
was that a similar program that you
 
02:43:21.349 --> 02:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
would have been interested in yes so
 
02:43:21.359 --> 02:43:22.309 align:start position:0%
would have been interested in yes so
essentially

02:43:22.309 --> 02:43:22.319 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:43:23.630 --> 02:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
um there was certainly legislation that
 
02:43:25.010 --> 02:43:25.020 align:start position:0%
would have put that money into this
 
02:43:27.349 --> 02:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
budget we know that for many reasons
 
02:43:28.969 --> 02:43:28.979 align:start position:0%
that didn't move through the house we're
 
02:43:31.130 --> 02:43:31.140 align:start position:0%
still very interested in expanding
 
02:43:33.230 --> 02:43:33.240 align:start position:0%
access to fresh fruit and vegetable for
 
02:43:38.630 --> 02:43:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:41.450 --> 02:43:41.460 align:start position:0%
so I'm not seeing any other questions I
 
02:43:43.429 --> 02:43:43.439 align:start position:0%
think you've marched through your slide
 
02:43:46.490 --> 02:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
deck for the day okay so let's talk
 
02:43:50.030 --> 02:43:50.040 align:start position:0%
about tomorrow uh I see on our calendar
 
02:43:51.950 --> 02:43:51.960 align:start position:0%
that we have the division of Public
 
02:43:55.070 --> 02:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
Health continued tomorrow what what what
 
02:43:56.870 --> 02:43:56.880 align:start position:0%
what does that mean
 
02:43:58.910 --> 02:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
that was in the calendar but Janet sent
 
02:44:01.370 --> 02:44:01.380 align:start position:0%
around to revision public health is done
 
02:44:02.990 --> 02:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
today and tomorrow you have Behavioral
 
02:44:05.630 --> 02:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
Health only starting at 10 o'clock so we
 
02:44:07.370 --> 02:44:07.380 align:start position:0%
still have we have a behavioral health
 
02:44:09.469 --> 02:44:09.479 align:start position:0%
and it's been properly noticed and it's
 
02:44:13.490 --> 02:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
at 10 o'clock tomorrow yes okay
 
02:44:15.290 --> 02:44:15.300 align:start position:0%
um say what location
 
02:44:17.870 --> 02:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
and and then our location's not here
 
02:44:21.230 --> 02:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is it I think it's in room 104.
 
02:44:23.210 --> 02:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
that sounds right let me just look that
 
02:44:25.090 --> 02:44:25.100 align:start position:0%
it's fun okay
 
02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
so not soon
 
02:44:31.790 --> 02:44:31.800 align:start position:0%
so miss Tilly once again very impressive
 
02:44:34.130 --> 02:44:34.140 align:start position:0%
performance that you you have a
 
02:44:36.110 --> 02:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
tremendous grasp of a tremendous amount
 
02:44:38.450 --> 02:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
of detail I appreciate it I always
 
02:44:41.270 --> 02:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
appreciate your responsiveness if not
 
02:44:44.330 --> 02:44:44.340 align:start position:0%
your answers but but but no you you

just you don't know but we were chatting
 
02:44:55.790 --> 02:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
the amount of detail that you've had to
 
02:44:58.130 --> 02:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
master in the last year to come up to
 
02:45:03.110 --> 02:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
speed and to be so so good at providing
 
02:45:05.270 --> 02:45:05.280 align:start position:0%
sort of a top-down view after you've had
 
02:45:07.550 --> 02:45:07.560 align:start position:0%
to like wrestle in the mud with the
 
02:45:10.429 --> 02:45:10.439 align:start position:0%
details is is really excellent it's very
 
02:45:12.590 --> 02:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
nice work I I would give all credit to
 
02:45:15.170 --> 02:45:15.180 align:start position:0%
the team that's behind me so
 
02:45:18.370 --> 02:45:18.380 align:start position:0%
well they're all nodding
 
02:45:22.130 --> 02:45:22.140 align:start position:0%
they took credit so so there's that did
 
02:45:24.170 --> 02:45:24.180 align:start position:0%
you have something represent a hole I
 
02:45:26.389 --> 02:45:26.399 align:start position:0%
concur with your comments I wanted when
 
02:45:29.389 --> 02:45:29.399 align:start position:0%
you're done to talk about HB 49 not
 
02:45:31.010 --> 02:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
relative to the bill but to something
 
02:45:33.590 --> 02:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
I'm handing out oh okay I'm just trying
 
02:45:35.690 --> 02:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
to let these folks go
 
02:45:38.330 --> 02:45:38.340 align:start position:0%

thank you
 
02:45:59.330 --> 02:45:59.340 align:start position:0%
uh as a comment I I I think the division
 
02:46:03.170 --> 02:46:03.180 align:start position:0%
is doing a good job of like once you
 
02:46:05.990 --> 02:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
start asking questions to just go ahead
 
02:46:08.510 --> 02:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
and continue to stay on the flow and
 
02:46:10.969 --> 02:46:10.979 align:start position:0%
that is an unusual thing compared to the
 
02:46:13.849 --> 02:46:13.859 align:start position:0%
way some committees work I I think it's
 
02:46:17.690 --> 02:46:17.700 align:start position:0%
working for us so I I would like to
 
02:46:19.490 --> 02:46:19.500 align:start position:0%
continue doing that instead of coming
 
02:46:21.170 --> 02:46:21.180 align:start position:0%
back every time I just think it
 
02:46:23.929 --> 02:46:23.939 align:start position:0%
interrupts the flow to do that
 
02:46:23.939 --> 02:46:25.210 align:start position:0%
interrupts the flow to do that
um

02:46:25.210 --> 02:46:25.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:46:29.870 --> 02:46:29.880 align:start position:0%
we have a request to talk about HB 49
 
02:46:32.450 --> 02:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
for a moment this is all very informal
 
02:46:35.030 --> 02:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
because that bill is now with a full
 
02:46:39.349 --> 02:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:41.030 --> 02:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
I'm going to pass out a document that I
 
02:46:43.070 --> 02:46:43.080 align:start position:0%
found that talks about this you know
 
02:46:45.770 --> 02:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
before you do that I I what do you
 
02:46:48.290 --> 02:46:48.300 align:start position:0%
what's your advice should I close the
 
02:46:50.750 --> 02:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
hearing we just had this and this is uh
 
02:46:52.790 --> 02:46:52.800 align:start position:0%
this is not a publicly noticed thing
 
02:46:55.070 --> 02:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
we're about to do I'm just handing out
 
02:46:57.290 --> 02:46:57.300 align:start position:0%
something okay so we're not going to
 
02:46:59.870 --> 02:46:59.880 align:start position:0%
discuss it and okay
 
02:47:03.830 --> 02:47:03.840 align:start position:0%
so not hb49 is not on the calendar for
 
02:47:03.840 --> 02:47:06.530 align:start position:0%
so not hb49 is not on the calendar for
today

02:47:06.530 --> 02:47:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:09.170 --> 02:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
I don't know go ahead give me an
 
02:47:10.610 --> 02:47:10.620 align:start position:0%
interpretation it's been changed since
 
02:47:11.870 --> 02:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
then it was no longer in the calendar
 
02:47:13.670 --> 02:47:13.680 align:start position:0%
today but if you're only handing around
 
02:47:16.250 --> 02:47:16.260 align:start position:0%
the document I I think it's fine so I'm
 
02:47:18.050 --> 02:47:18.060 align:start position:0%
going to close the work session of
 
02:47:19.849 --> 02:47:19.859 align:start position:0%
division three
 
02:47:23.150 --> 02:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
um relative to the public health and we
 
02:47:25.730 --> 02:47:25.740 align:start position:0%
can I don't think we need the cameras on
 
02:47:27.410 --> 02:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
anymore because you're just handing out
 
02:47:29.270 --> 02:47:29.280 align:start position:0%
I'm just hitting at a document that I
 
02:47:32.270 --> 02:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
found that deals with the relative costs
