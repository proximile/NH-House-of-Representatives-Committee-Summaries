um on the docket and we'll get right to
 
00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 align:start position:0%
that uh and uh there two off the top
 
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to talk about um I think
 
00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 align:start position:0%
arrive um she she's presenting in um
 
00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:40.869 --> 00:03:40.879 align:start position:0%
um yes Mr chairman I just want to um I
 
00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 align:start position:0%
received some comments based on our
 
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on Monday that I just wanted to
 
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 align:start position:0%
convey to the public some people reached
 
00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 align:start position:0%
out to me expressing concern about
 
00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
members not being present at all times
 
00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 align:start position:0%
during hearings and I just want to
 
00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
reiterate that sometimes because of
 
00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 align:start position:0%
schedules people can't be at hearings I
 
00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 align:start position:0%
know I myself missed hearing a week ago
 
00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
um and we do our best to be here for
 
00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:07.159 align:start position:0%
everything but given our salary of $100
 
00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:10.879 align:start position:0%
a year um uh before expenses and and
 
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
other things um sometimes not being
 
00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
present in person is unavoidable but we
 
00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
fortunately have the ability also to
 
00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 align:start position:0%
watch on YouTube um and watch the
 
00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:23.759 align:start position:0%
replays or to listen in um as hearings
 
00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 align:start position:0%
are being held and so I just want to
 
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
reiterate for the public that although
 
00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 align:start position:0%
we may not be physically in a room that
 
00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean we don't care about issues
 
00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 align:start position:0%
obviously it's our goal to be here at
 
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:38.000 align:start position:0%
all times if we're able yes thank you
 
00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 align:start position:0%
for mentioning that yes and just
 
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720 align:start position:0%
remember that some people have been sick
 
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 align:start position:0%
and have sick kids I I am I am
 
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
painfully uh resident
 
00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:50.759 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair as a person
 
00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
who was not able to attend physically
 
00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:56.039 align:start position:0%
the hearing on Monday secondary to viral
 
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
pneumonia um I would like everyone in
 
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 align:start position:0%
this room to know that I watch every
 
00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 align:start position:0%
single minute of that hearing on YouTube
 
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 align:start position:0%
and I I I really did find the comments
 
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 align:start position:0%
that went out on Twitter um egregious
 
00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:12.199 align:start position:0%
and and close to hateful because no one
 
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
misses a hearing because they don't want
 
00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:16.199 align:start position:0%
to hear what any constituent in the
 
00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 align:start position:0%
state has to say if they miss a hearing
 
00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
there's a very good reason so I I I
 
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for bringing
 
00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 align:start position:0%
this up and bringing this to light
 
00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
because this is not the type of rhetoric
 
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 align:start position:0%
we need right now so again I thank you
 
00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 align:start position:0%
for that thank you so uh the first bill
 
00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 align:start position:0%
that we'll bring up this morning is uh
 
00:05:42.029 --> 00:05:42.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
415 which is uh removing requirements
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
that schools provide menstrual products
 
00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 align:start position:0%
and uh call on representative Lichfield
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
for a motion yes I'd like to make the
 
00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 align:start position:0%
motion of itl please on House Bill 4115
 
00:05:59.950 --> 00:05:59.960 align:start position:0%
I'll second okay we have a first and
 
00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 align:start position:0%
second representative litfield would you
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
like to comment on your
 
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 align:start position:0%
motion I would thank you um although we
 
00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:08.919 align:start position:0%
are not in the business of supporting
 
00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:12.039 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates this has been on the
 
00:06:14.629 --> 00:06:14.639 align:start position:0%
books since 2019 I think probably maybe
 
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
it should not have been passed in the
 
00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:18.720 align:start position:0%
first place but as one of the members
 
00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 align:start position:0%
astutely put it we have hundreds of
 
00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:23.039 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandates on the book so maybe
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
we need to take a look at all of the
 
00:06:26.589 --> 00:06:26.599 align:start position:0%
other unfunded mandates at this point in
 
00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 align:start position:0%
time um but as it looks now it looks as
 
00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:31.639 align:start position:0%
things are going well districts some of
 
00:06:33.589 --> 00:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
them even put in six figures to put this
 
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:35.960 align:start position:0%
in place at the time um but it's in
 
00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 align:start position:0%
place now it's working well and we have
 
00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:40.960 align:start position:0%
not heard any complaints out of any of
 
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:42.720 align:start position:0%
the districts so at this point in time I
 
00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 align:start position:0%
think we should just leave it as
 
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.080 align:start position:0%
is thank you
 
00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
um who made the motion
 
00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
second you second representative Freeman
 
00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chair I I I couldn't
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
have said it any better than what um
 
00:06:59.309 --> 00:06:59.319 align:start position:0%
representative Lichfield had stated it's
 
00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:01.240 align:start position:0%
been an unfunded mandate for several
 
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:04.520 align:start position:0%
years um if the districts are are are
 
00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 align:start position:0%
cranking along with it and they don't
 
00:07:07.629 --> 00:07:07.639 align:start position:0%
have a problem with an unfunded mandate
 
00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
at this point I think we have big a fish
 
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.070 align:start position:0%
at this point I think we have big a fish
to

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:10.080 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:12.599 align:start position:0%
fry thank you any further comments
 
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative selig thank you I I would
 
00:07:18.189 --> 00:07:18.199 align:start position:0%
um agree that we should it all this bill
 
00:07:19.469 --> 00:07:19.479 align:start position:0%
but for different reasons I don't view
 
00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:21.400 align:start position:0%
this as an unfunded mandate I view
 
00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:22.879 align:start position:0%
menstrual products as essential as
 
00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:25.120 align:start position:0%
toilet paper as essential as paper
 
00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160 align:start position:0%
towels as uh someone who has had the
 
00:07:31.029 --> 00:07:31.039 align:start position:0%
misfortune of experiencing menstrual
 
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
symptoms uh unexpectedly I think that we
 
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that we're providing
 
00:07:39.510 --> 00:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
sanitary um waste products for anyone
 
00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:41.720 align:start position:0%
who needs
 
00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
them thank you any further comments
 
00:07:46.670 --> 00:07:46.680 align:start position:0%

Point um
 
00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:03.720 align:start position:0%
impacts the most needy
 
00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:07.159 align:start position:0%
women in our state and they go back and
 
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
take that opportunity away knowing the
 
00:08:12.189 --> 00:08:12.199 align:start position:0%
knowing the additional cost just costs
 
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:13.840 align:start position:0%
the youngsters not being in
 
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:16.520 align:start position:0%
school um it's not even a comparison so

um
 
00:11:31.069 --> 00:11:31.079 align:start position:0%
available uh I think that um this bill
 
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:35.720 align:start position:0%
um has some issues with regard to small
 
00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:38.200 align:start position:0%
districts Pro uh student
 
00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
privacy um I think some of the uh
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
information requested um possibly goes a
 
00:11:45.430 --> 00:11:45.440 align:start position:0%
little bit too
 
00:11:52.269 --> 00:11:52.279 align:start position:0%
far um we do have another bill uh HB 557
 
00:11:55.110 --> 00:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
related to uh information that's being
 
00:11:58.310 --> 00:11:58.320 align:start position:0%
made available um that we can always
 
00:12:02.550 --> 00:12:02.560 align:start position:0%
amend if people want to um add some uh
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%

said the
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
um the possibility of students um
 
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
records becoming or being identified is
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
concer especially in in small districts
 
00:12:31.680 --> 00:12:33.269 align:start position:0%

for a
 
00:15:13.069 --> 00:15:13.079 align:start position:0%

Freeman any discussion representative
 
00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:26.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:29.680 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh adoption is a very important topic to
 
00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:39.199 align:start position:0%
me as uh I was adopted from an orphanage
 
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:41.720 align:start position:0%
at a few months old in New York
 
00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:45.319 align:start position:0%
City and uh two years later my parents
 
00:15:47.350 --> 00:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
took me back down to that
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
orphanage um they said sorry no returns
 
00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:51.710 align:start position:0%
orphanage um they said sorry no returns
just

00:15:51.710 --> 00:15:51.720 align:start position:0%
just
 
00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:53.550 align:start position:0%
just
kidding

00:15:53.550 --> 00:15:53.560 align:start position:0%
kidding
 
00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:56.560 align:start position:0%
um uh they took me back down to that
 
00:15:59.509 --> 00:15:59.519 align:start position:0%
orphanage and I actually picked out my
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
sister from that orphanage
 
00:16:06.470 --> 00:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
so this is an important topic to
 
00:16:11.069 --> 00:16:11.079 align:start position:0%
me but I think that this bill is not the
 
00:16:14.629 --> 00:16:14.639 align:start position:0%
right vehicle to address um the
 
00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:19.360 align:start position:0%
topic um I think it's uh not necessary
 
00:16:23.870 --> 00:16:23.880 align:start position:0%
to get the uh colleges and universities
 
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:27.800 align:start position:0%
involved um nor the Attorney General um
 
00:16:30.189 --> 00:16:30.199 align:start position:0%
on this topic
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
um so that's um my reason for um making
 
00:16:41.629 --> 00:16:41.639 align:start position:0%
the motion of vling um we have other um
 
00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839 align:start position:0%
other bills um
 
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:47.440 align:start position:0%
related um somewhat to this and I'm
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
looking at you know maybe uh amendments
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
to one of those bills to merge uh two or
 
00:16:56.509 --> 00:16:56.519 align:start position:0%
three bills um so you know we'll talk
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
about that later but for now I itl on
 
00:17:03.909 --> 00:17:03.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:06.549 --> 00:17:06.559 align:start position:0%

00:18:56.789 --> 00:18:56.799 align:start position:0%
towards this bill because at this
 
00:18:59.750 --> 00:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
juncture we really need to have more
 
00:19:02.549 --> 00:19:02.559 align:start position:0%
Tools in our tool walks to set our
 
00:19:05.390 --> 00:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
youngest Learners up for success and
 
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:10.440 align:start position:0%
seeing as um this would address or at
 
00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:12.720 align:start position:0%
least begin to open the conversation in
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
districts on how we can um begin the
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
process I I think this is probably one
 
00:19:20.789 --> 00:19:20.799 align:start position:0%
of the least partisan bills we'll see
 
00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:24.039 align:start position:0%
out of this committee so I I'm leaning
 
00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:26.520 align:start position:0%
very heavily towards um aop
 
00:19:30.549 --> 00:19:30.559 align:start position:0%
pass and would like to thank think that
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
um again this will demonstrate our
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
willingness to pull out all the stops
 
00:19:36.789 --> 00:19:36.799 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that our youngest
 
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
Learners do have a solid foundation
 
00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:41.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much like playbase kindergarten
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
when we passed it six years ago thank
 
00:19:47.350 --> 00:19:47.360 align:start position:0%
you further discussion represent Murray
 
00:19:49.149 --> 00:19:49.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chair I just wanted to
 
00:19:51.390 --> 00:19:51.400 align:start position:0%
clarify when you were saying districts
 
00:19:54.029 --> 00:19:54.039 align:start position:0%
is it districts only um that have public
 
00:19:56.549 --> 00:19:56.559 align:start position:0%
preschools or are you offering that for
 
00:19:58.990 --> 00:19:59.000 align:start position:0%
all is that how you're interpreting the
 
00:20:00.630 --> 00:20:00.640 align:start position:0%
bill I guess is what I wanted to make
 
00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:02.200 align:start position:0%
sure that we were understanding because
 
00:20:04.110 --> 00:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's the way the bill is
 
00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:07.400 align:start position:0%
written it would be private preschools
 
00:20:09.430 --> 00:20:09.440 align:start position:0%
as well as
 
00:20:14.789 --> 00:20:14.799 align:start position:0%
public I think it says public preschool
 
00:20:18.990 --> 00:20:19.000 align:start position:0%
providers is that I I believe so I even
 
00:20:22.669 --> 00:20:22.679 align:start position:0%
um home home education as well okay
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell I I had questions
 
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:27.000 align:start position:0%
so I did get the phone number and called
 
00:20:29.909 --> 00:20:29.919 align:start position:0%
Rob Riley yesterday and asked him a few
 
00:20:33.710 --> 00:20:33.720 align:start position:0%
questions um I was concerned about um
 
00:20:36.990 --> 00:20:37.000 align:start position:0%
data um release and people finding out
 
00:20:40.270 --> 00:20:40.280 align:start position:0%
um and um I found that when families
 
00:20:43.190 --> 00:20:43.200 align:start position:0%
sign up for it they they sign up knowing
 
00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
that they're in explained that their
 
00:20:47.990 --> 00:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
information is not going to be shared
 
00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
only with the school district that they
 
00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:52.440 align:start position:0%
will be entering if they want to they
 
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:55.880 align:start position:0%
can opt out of that um it's not
 
00:20:58.270 --> 00:20:58.280 align:start position:0%
something that has to be in a classroom
 
00:21:01.190 --> 00:21:01.200 align:start position:0%
some where or preschool individual
 
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
families can sign up for it I guess they
 
00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:08.080 align:start position:0%
advertise a lot of places with a QR code
 
00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000 align:start position:0%
and families can do the QR code or some
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
other way and sign up for this um they
 
00:21:18.909 --> 00:21:18.919 align:start position:0%
do get a computer um which is nice um I
 
00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:21.880 align:start position:0%
asked about the 15 minutes actually
 
00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:24.400 align:start position:0%
making a difference 5 days a week and he
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
gave me statistics on different places
 
00:21:28.590 --> 00:21:28.600 align:start position:0%
that had used it where they tested
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
before and after and did show gains so
 
00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
it made me much more comfortable with um
 
00:21:38.789 --> 00:21:38.799 align:start position:0%
this I I'm not sure if if waterfood
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
would get the how that's going to work
 
00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
but if it is them I'm all for
 
00:21:48.909 --> 00:21:48.919 align:start position:0%
it um thank you I I view this really as
 
00:21:51.070 --> 00:21:51.080 align:start position:0%
a a
 
00:21:53.830 --> 00:21:53.840 align:start position:0%
partnership and I think you know
 
00:21:57.630 --> 00:21:57.640 align:start position:0%
reaching um uh people in their homes
 
00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
also I think is uh a nice aspect um to
 
00:22:06.909 --> 00:22:06.919 align:start position:0%
this to this program um could I first um
 
00:22:08.029 --> 00:22:08.039 align:start position:0%
before we have any more questions from
 
00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:11.080 align:start position:0%
the committee see um uh Melissa white
 
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
from the Department here and um I was
 
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could come up I I just had
 
00:22:19.029 --> 00:22:19.039 align:start position:0%
a question we had testimony about um a
 
00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:23.480 align:start position:0%
grant grant funds that were used um uh
 
00:22:28.149 --> 00:22:28.159 align:start position:0%
for this program um at one point and um
 
00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:29.600 align:start position:0%
I was wonder if you
 
00:22:33.110 --> 00:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
could uh Enlighten us more about about
 
00:22:34.630 --> 00:22:34.640 align:start position:0%
that I'm Melissa white division director
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
for learner support at the Department of
 
00:22:39.590 --> 00:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
Education so um fiscal year 22 and
 
00:22:41.750 --> 00:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 we entered into a
 
00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:44.960 align:start position:0%
contract with Waterford using our um
 
00:22:48.830 --> 00:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
American Rescue plan sr3 funds so it was
 
00:22:50.950 --> 00:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
the co relief funds that were utilized
 
00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
for this contract to provide um the
 
00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:57.000 align:start position:0%
early literacy services to families it
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
was 400 ,000 for fiscal year 22 which
 
00:23:02.990 --> 00:23:03.000 align:start position:0%
only included part of fiscal year 22 and
 
00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
then $600,000 for fiscal entire fiscal
 
00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.070 align:start position:0%
then $600,000 for fiscal entire fiscal
year

00:23:09.070 --> 00:23:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.669 --> 00:23:12.679 align:start position:0%
23 fiscal year right uh do you know how
 
00:23:17.110 --> 00:23:17.120 align:start position:0%
many um uh families or uh children were
 
00:23:18.909 --> 00:23:18.919 align:start position:0%
able to participate in the program
 
00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
during that period I do not have that
 
00:23:22.830 --> 00:23:22.840 align:start position:0%
information they did Waterford did
 
00:23:24.430 --> 00:23:24.440 align:start position:0%
provide reports to us I'd have to go
 
00:23:25.870 --> 00:23:25.880 align:start position:0%
back and take a take a peek I was trying
 
00:23:27.510 --> 00:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
to dig that up right when I was sitting
 
00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
there um to have that information but um
 
00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:33.320 align:start position:0%
I I can get that to the committee um
 
00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
with the information you got um do you
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
feel that the uh program was successful
 
00:23:42.510 --> 00:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh helping with Early
 
00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:43.909 align:start position:0%
in terms of uh helping with Early
Childhood

00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
Childhood
 
00:23:46.070 --> 00:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
literacy I think that would be difficult
 
00:23:47.789 --> 00:23:47.799 align:start position:0%
to answer because there was no way for
 
00:23:50.549 --> 00:23:50.559 align:start position:0%
us to measure that we couldn't do sort
 
00:23:52.110 --> 00:23:52.120 align:start position:0%
of you know to measure something like
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
that you have to do some sort of a pre
 
00:23:56.470 --> 00:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
pre-assessment and then a postassessment
 
00:24:00.830 --> 00:24:00.840 align:start position:0%
and um for this particular population
 
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
there's no way for us to to have that
 
00:24:05.630 --> 00:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
that data unfortunately thank you
 
00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:08.760 align:start position:0%
represent Sally thank you um just one
 
00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:11.000 align:start position:0%
when the person representing the company
 
00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
that worked with us they referenced um
 
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
something to do with reaching out to the
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
AG's office um related to their Grant
 
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:19.400 align:start position:0%
and I wondered if you had any insight as
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
to why the Attorney General's office
 
00:24:24.950 --> 00:24:24.960 align:start position:0%
would have been involved in a education
 
00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:27.520 align:start position:0%
grant um because I didn't get I I didn't
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
process it until it was too late to ask
 
00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:31.360 align:start position:0%
the question then that I'm not um
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
entirely sure of because the contract
 
00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:37.760 align:start position:0%
was completed at the end of fiscal year
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
23 so that the and that was two like two
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
years ago um so I'm not exactly sure
 
00:24:46.549 --> 00:24:46.559 align:start position:0%
what they reached out to the AG's office
 
00:24:48.750 --> 00:24:48.760 align:start position:0%
about but I mean the AG does review and
 
00:24:50.350 --> 00:24:50.360 align:start position:0%
approve and then our contracts go
 
00:24:52.430 --> 00:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
through um you know governor and Council
 
00:24:54.590 --> 00:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
so I'm not sure if it had something to
 
00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
do with that component or but I can look
 
00:25:01.029 --> 00:25:01.039 align:start position:0%
into that a little bit more to get
 
00:25:03.190 --> 00:25:03.200 align:start position:0%
information thank you Mr chair thank you
 
00:25:05.149 --> 00:25:05.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question my other question
 
00:25:07.350 --> 00:25:07.360 align:start position:0%
was around the data that you said you
 
00:25:10.350 --> 00:25:10.360 align:start position:0%
did receive was that data that was
 
00:25:12.350 --> 00:25:12.360 align:start position:0%
automatically sent to you or again did
 
00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
parents have to opt in or opt out to to
 
00:25:18.870 --> 00:25:18.880 align:start position:0%
give that data to you thank you for the
 
00:25:21.549 --> 00:25:21.559 align:start position:0%
question no it it was actually part of
 
00:25:23.669 --> 00:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
the invoicing process so Waterford would
 
00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:25.360 align:start position:0%
collect information on the families that
 
00:25:28.070 --> 00:25:28.080 align:start position:0%
they serve but it really was just um
 
00:25:30.510 --> 00:25:30.520 align:start position:0%
kind of kind of a listing of of numbers
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
really of these are the people that are
 
00:25:34.110 --> 00:25:34.120 align:start position:0%
served but it was all pii so we didn't
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
actually get information on the exact
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
like a name and uh address or anything
 
00:25:41.590 --> 00:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
like that for the families that
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
participated I'm coming back question
 
00:25:46.590 --> 00:25:46.600 align:start position:0%
Hall thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:25:48.789 --> 00:25:48.799 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm just curious
 
00:25:50.590 --> 00:25:50.600 align:start position:0%
when it says the Statewide nonprofit
 
00:25:52.430 --> 00:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
digital programs and we're talking about
 
00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:54.600 align:start position:0%
Waterford specifically is there a chance
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
it could be not Waterford are there
 
00:25:58.310 --> 00:25:58.320 align:start position:0%
other programs that we know that are not
 
00:26:00.510 --> 00:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofit Statewide you I mean or is
 
00:26:02.350 --> 00:26:02.360 align:start position:0%
this really it doesn't state state
 
00:26:03.950 --> 00:26:03.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't State Waterford but it probably
 
00:26:06.350 --> 00:26:06.360 align:start position:0%
is that's a great question I think I
 
00:26:09.029 --> 00:26:09.039 align:start position:0%
mean it it would be at the discretion of
 
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:11.000 align:start position:0%
this body I think that if we could do an
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
RFP and put out a request for proposals
 
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:16.880 align:start position:0%
to see if there are other organizations
 
00:26:19.510 --> 00:26:19.520 align:start position:0%
at the time um during covid we were
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
looking specifically on increasing those
 
00:26:23.549 --> 00:26:23.559 align:start position:0%
literacy outcomes and engaging those
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
families during covid that were at home
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
so they could better support um us their
 
00:26:30.430 --> 00:26:30.440 align:start position:0%
families and in those you know three to
 
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:33.320 align:start position:0%
five year olds and pre-literate students
 
00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
and so it was
 
00:26:38.549 --> 00:26:38.559 align:start position:0%
um a soul Source contract that was was
 
00:26:40.310 --> 00:26:40.320 align:start position:0%
done at that time but I mean we could do
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
an RFP however with a dollar allocation
 
00:26:45.870 --> 00:26:45.880 align:start position:0%
if it were to pass I wouldn't be able to
 
00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:47.320 align:start position:0%
do anything I couldn't do an RFP I
 
00:26:48.750 --> 00:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
couldn't enter into a contract because
 
00:26:51.430 --> 00:26:51.440 align:start position:0%
there would be no funds to do that
 
00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:55.240 align:start position:0%
follow up yes so I I just want to make
 
00:26:57.470 --> 00:26:57.480 align:start position:0%
sure here so if this were to pass as is
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
it probably would be Waterford so that
 
00:27:01.389 --> 00:27:01.399 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have to do an RFP and
 
00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:03.559 align:start position:0%
whatnot I think because of the
 
00:27:05.269 --> 00:27:05.279 align:start position:0%
procurement process that the state
 
00:27:07.269 --> 00:27:07.279 align:start position:0%
requires I think we would have to
 
00:27:11.110 --> 00:27:11.120 align:start position:0%
probably do an RFP um particularly with
 
00:27:12.990 --> 00:27:13.000 align:start position:0%
the governor new governor and coun
 
00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:16.000 align:start position:0%
executive counsel um they want to ensure
 
00:27:19.470 --> 00:27:19.480 align:start position:0%
that the um procurement process that the
 
00:27:23.110 --> 00:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
state has outlined and is in law is is
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
being followed I think at the time with
 
00:27:29.269 --> 00:27:29.279 align:start position:0%
the emergency funds it it was an an eem
 
00:27:30.750 --> 00:27:30.760 align:start position:0%
kind of fell into that emergency
 
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:34.200 align:start position:0%
category but seeing as we're out of that
 
00:27:36.149 --> 00:27:36.159 align:start position:0%
um it would probably be best to be
 
00:27:38.430 --> 00:27:38.440 align:start position:0%
following that procurement process and
 
00:27:41.149 --> 00:27:41.159 align:start position:0%
and follow the competitive bidding
 
00:27:44.669 --> 00:27:44.679 align:start position:0%
process I do one more followup sure so
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
are there other companies that we know
 
00:27:48.029 --> 00:27:48.039 align:start position:0%
of or is it pretty much the not that I
 
00:27:50.389 --> 00:27:50.399 align:start position:0%
know of but I mean I don't I'm not you
 
00:27:51.909 --> 00:27:51.919 align:start position:0%
know the most knowledgeable I guess on
 
00:27:54.029 --> 00:27:54.039 align:start position:0%
those uh early literacy program so I
 
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
mean we could do that request for
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
proposals and and see if there are
 
00:27:57.720 --> 00:27:59.070 align:start position:0%
proposals and and see if there are
others

00:27:59.070 --> 00:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
others
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
okay thank you yeah yeah it's my
 
00:28:03.389 --> 00:28:03.399 align:start position:0%
understanding there would be you know
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
the normal procurement process yeah um
 
00:28:08.430 --> 00:28:08.440 align:start position:0%
did I see another hand representative
 
00:28:10.750 --> 00:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you chairman Kelli good
 
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:13.480 align:start position:0%
morning good morning welcome um I just
 
00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:17.440 align:start position:0%
want to be clear the uh basically $1
 
00:28:19.789 --> 00:28:19.799 align:start position:0%
million that deal we provide during
 
00:28:21.549 --> 00:28:21.559 align:start position:0%
those two physical years for this
 
00:28:24.509 --> 00:28:24.519 align:start position:0%
program during the co piece when they
 
00:28:26.549 --> 00:28:26.559 align:start position:0%
presented the other day they also said
 
00:28:29.110 --> 00:28:29.120 align:start position:0%
that they had a million 1 $5 million
 
00:28:31.389 --> 00:28:31.399 align:start position:0%
Grant on the federal government that
 
00:28:34.070 --> 00:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
went through UNH is that how did that
 
00:28:37.430 --> 00:28:37.440 align:start position:0%
play in that one I'm not aware of but
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
the the grant uh the contract that I
 
00:28:41.909 --> 00:28:41.919 align:start position:0%
oversaw or I should say the Department
 
00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
of Education oversaw was the 1
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
million okay that came through the
 
00:28:49.389 --> 00:28:49.399 align:start position:0%
division thank you um just going back
 
00:28:51.630 --> 00:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
then to because there isn't um as you're
 
00:28:52.950 --> 00:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
aware there isn't a financial note
 
00:28:55.269 --> 00:28:55.279 align:start position:0%
really attached it just something coming
 
00:28:59.029 --> 00:28:59.039 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at um the line eight on the
 
00:29:01.310 --> 00:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
bill which talks
 
00:29:03.509 --> 00:29:03.519 align:start position:0%
about subject to extent the funds
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
appropriated shall be uh provided for
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
preschools uh my concern
 
00:29:13.549 --> 00:29:13.559 align:start position:0%
is knowing the physical climate we're in
 
00:29:17.470 --> 00:29:17.480 align:start position:0%
right now that this would seem like a a
 
00:29:20.870 --> 00:29:20.880 align:start position:0%
really good bill perhaps or a Feelgood
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
Bill and clearly Readiness Bill and
 
00:29:24.669 --> 00:29:24.679 align:start position:0%
people would think that it's going to
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
happen but it doesn't appear to me that
 
00:29:28.830 --> 00:29:28.840 align:start position:0%
that being the case in the only $1 in
 
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
the The Chill correct um would that be
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
your same take on that yes I would not
 
00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:35.320 align:start position:0%
be if it passed I would not be able to
 
00:29:37.509 --> 00:29:37.519 align:start position:0%
execute it with the dollar appropriation
 
00:29:39.590 --> 00:29:39.600 align:start position:0%
we wouldn't be able to do anything last
 
00:29:43.110 --> 00:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
last one just on that point um it it's
 
00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:44.440 align:start position:0%
my understanding this would go to
 
00:29:47.149 --> 00:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
finance and they would see um where
 
00:29:50.470 --> 00:29:50.480 align:start position:0%
things stood with the budget um and uh
 
00:29:52.310 --> 00:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
because there is an appropriation if
 
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
even a dollar in here they can uh amend
 
00:29:58.389 --> 00:29:58.399 align:start position:0%
it uh to uh increase that appropriate
 
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
ation um and there's also um you know we
 
00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.640 align:start position:0%
we talked about this being a public
 
00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:09.519 align:start position:0%
nonprofit um partnership um so there are
 
00:30:12.870 --> 00:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
uh nonprofit uh opportunities out there
 
00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:15.200 align:start position:0%
also to contribute to this can I follow
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
up on your point you may follow up thank
 
00:30:19.149 --> 00:30:19.159 align:start position:0%
you chairman um going back to your point
 
00:30:22.710 --> 00:30:22.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and once again um I'm looking
 
00:30:24.149 --> 00:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
at the
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
the I don't I don't have a problem with
 
00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:28.000 align:start position:0%
the program I'm not a happy guy with
 
00:30:30.070 --> 00:30:30.080 align:start position:0%
computer young sitting around reading
 
00:30:31.630 --> 00:30:31.640 align:start position:0%
and the parents helping them but what
 
00:30:32.909 --> 00:30:32.919 align:start position:0%
what does concern me is that the
 
00:30:35.110 --> 00:30:35.120 align:start position:0%
limitation we put that whoever the
 
00:30:37.389 --> 00:30:37.399 align:start position:0%
provider is they have to be spef be a
 
00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
nonprofit a registered nonprofit based
 
00:30:44.149 --> 00:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
on Bas 24 I understand the particular
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
vendor from before was uh and can be in
 
00:30:49.430 --> 00:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
the future but I find it really
 
00:30:51.549 --> 00:30:51.559 align:start position:0%
restrictive because I'm sure there are
 
00:30:53.549 --> 00:30:53.559 align:start position:0%
many I'm guessing many I'm sure there
 
00:30:55.909 --> 00:30:55.919 align:start position:0%
are for-profit companies out there that
 
00:30:57.710 --> 00:30:57.720 align:start position:0%
provide similar services or comparable
 
00:30:59.750 --> 00:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
Serv serves that won't be even eligible
 
00:31:02.389 --> 00:31:02.399 align:start position:0%
to apply based on that nonprofit
 
00:31:02.399 --> 00:31:03.549 align:start position:0%
to apply based on that nonprofit
definition

00:31:03.549 --> 00:31:03.559 align:start position:0%
definition
 
00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:05.360 align:start position:0%
requirement is that how you read that
 
00:31:06.990 --> 00:31:07.000 align:start position:0%
bill um I don't know how many would
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
apply but if we did an RFP we would
 
00:31:10.789 --> 00:31:10.799 align:start position:0%
include the requirements in there so if
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
the nonprofit requirement was in statute
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
we would include that in the RFP have to
 
00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
be enough okay thank you thank you
 
00:31:20.909 --> 00:31:20.919 align:start position:0%
chairman repres Murray and then M
 
00:31:22.509 --> 00:31:22.519 align:start position:0%
representative Terry after that thank
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:31:26.070 --> 00:31:26.080 align:start position:0%
question so the I believe we did get a
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
late arriving fiscal note if that was
 
00:31:30.750 --> 00:31:30.760 align:start position:0%
correct I I I do remember that um and it
 
00:31:33.389 --> 00:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
did set up the appropriation funded at a
 
00:31:36.909 --> 00:31:36.919 align:start position:0%
dollar but I think it was $600,000 was
 
00:31:39.669 --> 00:31:39.679 align:start position:0%
an estimated cost for fiscal years 26 27
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
and 28 potentially it wasn't clear to me
 
00:31:44.470 --> 00:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
if that was spread out across all three
 
00:31:46.990 --> 00:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
fiscal years or if that is per fiscal
 
00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
year but I it seems like it's maybe
 
00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
spread out um thank you for the question
 
00:31:55.029 --> 00:31:55.039 align:start position:0%
so that was based on what we paid for
 
00:31:58.350 --> 00:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 fiscal year um 22 was
 
00:32:01.110 --> 00:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
just a partial year so I based it on
 
00:32:02.950 --> 00:32:02.960 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 23 because that was an
 
00:32:06.070 --> 00:32:06.080 align:start position:0%
entire year that we had the contract so
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
it would be $600,000 per year based on
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
that previous contract but again I mean
 
00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:15.360 align:start position:0%
we could do the RFP and then um see what
 
00:32:18.350 --> 00:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
the proposals we've received and um came
 
00:32:20.990 --> 00:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
in at okay follow if I'm right and then
 
00:32:22.830 --> 00:32:22.840 align:start position:0%
in addition under the methodology it
 
00:32:25.590 --> 00:32:25.600 align:start position:0%
does mention Wick um but I was curious
 
00:32:27.190 --> 00:32:27.200 align:start position:0%
if this would also be available to
 
00:32:29.590 --> 00:32:29.600 align:start position:0%
programs like starts and that type of
 
00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
thing for for application or to share
 
00:32:36.710 --> 00:32:36.720 align:start position:0%
with their their family base correct
 
00:32:38.870 --> 00:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's my understanding as
 
00:32:41.389 --> 00:32:41.399 align:start position:0%
well thank you very much uh
 
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
representative um Terry yeah um as it
 
00:32:47.470 --> 00:32:47.480 align:start position:0%
turns out uh thank you representative
 
00:32:50.509 --> 00:32:50.519 align:start position:0%
Woodcock for your um your last uh
 
00:32:53.149 --> 00:32:53.159 align:start position:0%
question and concern um because I want
 
00:32:56.269 --> 00:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
to Echo agreement um with that we I
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
believe we want to make sure
 
00:33:01.950 --> 00:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
that um the best providers of these
 
00:33:06.669 --> 00:33:06.679 align:start position:0%
Services would be made available um I
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
don't know you don't I believe you don't
 
00:33:12.389 --> 00:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
know we don't know um the breakdown
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
between nonprofits and for-profit
 
00:33:18.789 --> 00:33:18.799 align:start position:0%
providers uh nevertheless um I I came
 
00:33:21.430 --> 00:33:21.440 align:start position:0%
away from the hearing on the bill with a
 
00:33:23.870 --> 00:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
distinct impression that there was there
 
00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:27.240 align:start position:0%
there were more than one uh nonprofit uh
 
00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:28.430 align:start position:0%
there were more than one uh nonprofit uh
provider

00:33:28.430 --> 00:33:28.440 align:start position:0%
provider
 
00:33:31.389 --> 00:33:31.399 align:start position:0%
and so um I'm I'm hopeful that as we
 
00:33:34.269 --> 00:33:34.279 align:start position:0%
move forward we will find that there
 
00:33:37.870 --> 00:33:37.880 align:start position:0%
will be uh providers from other states
 
00:33:39.830 --> 00:33:39.840 align:start position:0%
that are operating in other states that
 
00:33:42.430 --> 00:33:42.440 align:start position:0%
would Express an interest so that uh
 
00:33:44.710 --> 00:33:44.720 align:start position:0%
ultimately as I said we can end up with
 
00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:46.200 align:start position:0%
um the best provider not only in terms
 
00:33:48.909 --> 00:33:48.919 align:start position:0%
of dollars but um with respect to
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
evidence-based results in uh in other
 
00:33:55.430 --> 00:33:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:58.830 --> 00:33:58.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you thank you very much Miss
 
00:34:01.870 --> 00:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
White for being here today um and I see
 
00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:05.600 align:start position:0%
um Teresa Rosenberger in the audience um
 
00:34:07.350 --> 00:34:07.360 align:start position:0%
there were a couple of other questions
 
00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:09.960 align:start position:0%
and maybe uh you could help us with if
 
00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:12.760 align:start position:0%
if you
 
00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:23.829 align:start position:0%
if you
wish

00:34:23.829 --> 00:34:23.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:26.829 --> 00:34:26.839 align:start position:0%
sure yeah yeah I I think one question
 
00:34:29.310 --> 00:34:29.320 align:start position:0%
off the bat that I call was um if there
 
00:34:32.190 --> 00:34:32.200 align:start position:0%
are other companies um out there who
 
00:34:36.109 --> 00:34:36.119 align:start position:0%
might uh fit the criteria to uh to bid
 
00:34:39.030 --> 00:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
in an RFP for this yes there are other
 
00:34:41.829 --> 00:34:41.839 align:start position:0%
companies as I understand it nonprofit
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
and for-profit around the country that
 
00:34:49.389 --> 00:34:49.399 align:start position:0%
that could qualify thank you additional
 
00:34:53.190 --> 00:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
would may I answer uh rep C's question I
 
00:34:56.589 --> 00:34:56.599 align:start position:0%
I did mention the AG um that was totally
 
00:34:59.390 --> 00:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
different when because we had children
 
00:35:02.349 --> 00:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
signed up and the money the contract was
 
00:35:06.550 --> 00:35:06.560 align:start position:0%
over June 30th um we were looking for
 
00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:09.680 align:start position:0%
what I call um out of the box clever
 
00:35:12.349 --> 00:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
ways to serve these children we looked
 
00:35:15.230 --> 00:35:15.240 align:start position:0%
at the op batement funds that the state
 
00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:18.040 align:start position:0%
got because of the lawsuit a while back
 
00:35:20.990 --> 00:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
and we realized that there were a number
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
of towns that had not used the funds and
 
00:35:26.470 --> 00:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
when we looked at the guidelines I think
 
00:35:28.750 --> 00:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
there were 177
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
guidelines it looked to us like one was
 
00:35:34.870 --> 00:35:34.880 align:start position:0%
prevention of drug abuse and alcohol
 
00:35:36.790 --> 00:35:36.800 align:start position:0%
abuse Etc and we were
 
00:35:39.550 --> 00:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
interpreting and thought we had reason
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
to interpret that that having kids know
 
00:35:45.829 --> 00:35:45.839 align:start position:0%
how to read and be ready to read and
 
00:35:47.950 --> 00:35:47.960 align:start position:0%
learn to read by third grade might
 
00:35:50.470 --> 00:35:50.480 align:start position:0%
actually prevent some of the drug abuse
 
00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
and and alcohol abuse in teenagers Etc
 
00:35:56.750 --> 00:35:56.760 align:start position:0%
so we went to the city of London da and
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
met with the city manager and the
 
00:36:02.390 --> 00:36:02.400 align:start position:0%
finance gentleman who thought great idea
 
00:36:04.990 --> 00:36:05.000 align:start position:0%
cuz they had up at abatement funds they
 
00:36:07.990 --> 00:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
also only did half day kindergarten and
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
they thought we could provide the 15
 
00:36:13.230 --> 00:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
minutes a day for the kids who in half
 
00:36:15.190 --> 00:36:15.200 align:start position:0%
day kindergarten to keep them on track
 
00:36:18.109 --> 00:36:18.119 align:start position:0%
and and be with other kids who whole day
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
kindergarten across the state they then
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
had to go to the Attorney General's
 
00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
office to get approval to use their
 
00:36:29.150 --> 00:36:29.160 align:start position:0%
opioid abatement funds for that purpose
 
00:36:32.550 --> 00:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
that was what was turned down and so
 
00:36:33.990 --> 00:36:34.000 align:start position:0%
therefore they couldn't do it because
 
00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
they were they were totally on board as
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
we were so nothing to do with the um the
 
00:36:45.710 --> 00:36:45.720 align:start position:0%
other contract and the contract that um
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
that um Melissa Miss White is speaking
 
00:36:50.550 --> 00:36:50.560 align:start position:0%
about and I was speaking about were the
 
00:36:54.390 --> 00:36:54.400 align:start position:0%
same because the the Ursa three funds
 
00:36:56.910 --> 00:36:56.920 align:start position:0%
were the funds we got through UNH and I
 
00:36:58.910 --> 00:36:58.920 align:start position:0%
think she's right it was a million a
 
00:37:01.270 --> 00:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
million I may have said a million5 but
 
00:37:02.630 --> 00:37:02.640 align:start position:0%
but I think she's right that it was a
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
million and we had gotten funds through
 
00:37:07.470 --> 00:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
the United Way and Nashville before for
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
the pilot program which were not part of
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
the Ursa funds so I hope that Clair
 
00:37:16.510 --> 00:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
clarifies that and happy to answer any
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
other questions if there are Murray yes
 
00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question one of
 
00:37:22.790 --> 00:37:22.800 align:start position:0%
the other questions I had was with
 
00:37:24.390 --> 00:37:24.400 align:start position:0%
regard to I understood representative
 
00:37:27.150 --> 00:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
Cornell um brought to light about the
 
00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
techn techology itself would stay with
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
the family after they were finished it
 
00:37:32.630 --> 00:37:32.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily get returned back
 
00:37:35.069 --> 00:37:35.079 align:start position:0%
anywhere but what happens to the like
 
00:37:37.309 --> 00:37:37.319 align:start position:0%
let's say if internet is connected do
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
they lose internet connectivity if it is
 
00:37:41.990 --> 00:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
paid for through the company or how do
 
00:37:44.109 --> 00:37:44.119 align:start position:0%
how does that work no the company the
 
00:37:46.910 --> 00:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
company is I and I you know I haven't
 
00:37:48.550 --> 00:37:48.560 align:start position:0%
asked that question recently to the
 
00:37:50.750 --> 00:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
company but as I understand it the
 
00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
technology stage in the internet now
 
00:37:56.309 --> 00:37:56.319 align:start position:0%
once the child has I I well let me go
 
00:37:58.829 --> 00:37:58.839 align:start position:0%
back and clarify that for you cuz I'm
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
not sure the family gets the internet
 
00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:02.430 align:start position:0%
not sure the family gets the internet
connection

00:38:02.430 --> 00:38:02.440 align:start position:0%
connection
 
00:38:04.550 --> 00:38:04.560 align:start position:0%
forever I mean they
 
00:38:07.790 --> 00:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
certainly Waterford certainly has paid
 
00:38:10.829 --> 00:38:10.839 align:start position:0%
for the connection while the child is
 
00:38:14.790 --> 00:38:14.800 align:start position:0%
using the program and the the equipment
 
00:38:18.190 --> 00:38:18.200 align:start position:0%
stays with the child but I'm not sure
 
00:38:20.109 --> 00:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
they pay for the
 
00:38:23.069 --> 00:38:23.079 align:start position:0%
internet forever and and the reason it
 
00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:26.400 align:start position:0%
was a private public partnership is as I
 
00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:29.200 align:start position:0%
understand it the Department can't pay
 
00:38:30.550 --> 00:38:30.560 align:start position:0%
for the
 
00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
equipment well we couldn't they couldn't
 
00:38:35.150 --> 00:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
use the federal funds for the equipment
 
00:38:38.430 --> 00:38:38.440 align:start position:0%
so water for being a nonprofit came in
 
00:38:41.030 --> 00:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
with with funding and and paid for the
 
00:38:43.309 --> 00:38:43.319 align:start position:0%
equipment and the internet connection
 
00:38:44.990 --> 00:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
but if you like I'll clarify that for
 
00:38:47.670 --> 00:38:47.680 align:start position:0%
you I I'll I'll send rob a text when I
 
00:38:50.309 --> 00:38:50.319 align:start position:0%
go back to my chair represent
 
00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:53.520 align:start position:0%
Terry uh M Ros if I've heard you
 
00:38:55.910 --> 00:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
correctly you've indicated in your
 
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:58.760 align:start position:0%
remarks that there are both nonprofits
 
00:39:01.430 --> 00:39:01.440 align:start position:0%
and profit uh
 
00:39:04.270 --> 00:39:04.280 align:start position:0%
entities uh Mr chairman if if that is
 
00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.270 align:start position:0%
entities uh Mr chairman if if that is
the

00:39:05.270 --> 00:39:05.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:09.160 align:start position:0%
case um then I I don't believe that we
 
00:39:14.270 --> 00:39:14.280 align:start position:0%
know why the sponsor chose to indicate
 
00:39:16.470 --> 00:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
that on line
 
00:39:22.589 --> 00:39:22.599 align:start position:0%
21 um e on page one of the bill that
 
00:39:24.790 --> 00:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
kindergarten literacy Readiness program
 
00:39:27.950 --> 00:39:27.960 align:start position:0%
is defined um as non profit and
 
00:39:32.510 --> 00:39:32.520 align:start position:0%
nonprofit only so do we want to look at
 
00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.349 align:start position:0%
nonprofit only so do we want to look at
the

00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:39:36.390 --> 00:39:36.400 align:start position:0%
possibility um of asking the question
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
why only nonprofit to the sponsor um so
 
00:39:41.349 --> 00:39:41.359 align:start position:0%
that we might be made aware of why
 
00:39:44.790 --> 00:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
there's a compelling reason that um this
 
00:39:47.390 --> 00:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
would be limited only to nonprofits as
 
00:39:49.870 --> 00:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
we might want possibly want to possibly
 
00:39:52.510 --> 00:39:52.520 align:start position:0%
consider eliminating nonprofit to open
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
the field to all providers whether
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
nonprofit or profit
 
00:40:01.390 --> 00:40:01.400 align:start position:0%
yes if you'd like to respond I think um
 
00:40:04.109 --> 00:40:04.119 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons is in other states
 
00:40:08.230 --> 00:40:08.240 align:start position:0%
where they've had public private funding
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
that that there has been Foundation
 
00:40:13.630 --> 00:40:13.640 align:start position:0%
money that has helped supplement so for
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
example here if the state appropriates
 
00:40:20.589 --> 00:40:20.599 align:start position:0%
let's say $600,000 a year that may not
 
00:40:23.670 --> 00:40:23.680 align:start position:0%
cover all the cats who who sign up it
 
00:40:25.670 --> 00:40:25.680 align:start position:0%
may it may not but if you you know if
 
00:40:29.230 --> 00:40:29.240 align:start position:0%
you're if you've got kids that if you
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
got more kids then you have money then
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
you don't want to turn kids away and so
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
you may well go to a foundation to say
 
00:40:41.790 --> 00:40:41.800 align:start position:0%
could you any up aund and half extra
 
00:40:45.950 --> 00:40:45.960 align:start position:0%
$150,000 to the state and if so a lot of
 
00:40:48.030 --> 00:40:48.040 align:start position:0%
times foundations prefer nonprofits to
 
00:40:50.230 --> 00:40:50.240 align:start position:0%
for-profits and I think that that was
 
00:40:53.069 --> 00:40:53.079 align:start position:0%
the reason to put it in there I know
 
00:40:54.829 --> 00:40:54.839 align:start position:0%
when we were trying because as you know
 
00:40:59.510 --> 00:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
we had kids signed up um for this
 
00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:02.720 align:start position:0%
current school year that we can't fund
 
00:41:06.829 --> 00:41:06.839 align:start position:0%
and so again we tried the foundation
 
00:41:09.390 --> 00:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
route but what this bill does is it says
 
00:41:12.750 --> 00:41:12.760 align:start position:0%
this is important to the state and in
 
00:41:15.349 --> 00:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
many ways will allow foundations to go
 
00:41:17.910 --> 00:41:17.920 align:start position:0%
we understand there's a revenue issue
 
00:41:21.069 --> 00:41:21.079 align:start position:0%
here maybe we can help out in something
 
00:41:23.150 --> 00:41:23.160 align:start position:0%
important so that I think is the reason
 
00:41:25.950 --> 00:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
it was nonprofit okay follow on point
 
00:41:30.589 --> 00:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
yes um so are you A Ware of uh other uh
 
00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:33.640 align:start position:0%
nonprofit programs in other states such
 
00:41:35.870 --> 00:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
that if this bill were to be enacted
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
there would be more than one entity or
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
provider potentially that would apply I
 
00:41:43.870 --> 00:41:43.880 align:start position:0%
will double check again but when we were
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
talking about this originally there's no
 
00:41:49.030 --> 00:41:49.040 align:start position:0%
question there were other entities that
 
00:41:51.510 --> 00:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
could nonprofits that could qualify and
 
00:41:55.349 --> 00:41:55.359 align:start position:0%
our and Waterford would hope it was an
 
00:41:59.270 --> 00:41:59.280 align:start position:0%
RFP would hope you would put at RFP and
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
Miss White's right when they got the
 
00:42:04.589 --> 00:42:04.599 align:start position:0%
contract originally it was during covid
 
00:42:07.349 --> 00:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
and I think the state everybody the feds
 
00:42:08.670 --> 00:42:08.680 align:start position:0%
every was trying to do everything they
 
00:42:11.190 --> 00:42:11.200 align:start position:0%
could to keep kids get kids prepared and
 
00:42:14.349 --> 00:42:14.359 align:start position:0%
keep them up to up to snuff but uh we
 
00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:17.240 align:start position:0%
certainly would welcome it being a a
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
competitive bidding process and that we
 
00:42:22.230 --> 00:42:22.240 align:start position:0%
certainly would expect there others that
 
00:42:25.230 --> 00:42:25.240 align:start position:0%
would apply thank you thank you I'm
 
00:42:28.069 --> 00:42:28.079 align:start position:0%
repres Cornell Thank you um when I was
 
00:42:30.349 --> 00:42:30.359 align:start position:0%
speaking to Rob Riley yesterday I asked
 
00:42:32.549 --> 00:42:32.559 align:start position:0%
him about that I said you know you you
 
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
help he said we did help write the bill
 
00:42:37.109 --> 00:42:37.119 align:start position:0%
and we hope it would be us he said but
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
he did realize that it would be open to
 
00:42:44.670 --> 00:42:44.680 align:start position:0%
others too so you know he they hoped
 
00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
but representative
 
00:42:49.069 --> 00:42:49.079 align:start position:0%
litfield thank you and thank you for
 
00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:51.520 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm not sure if
 
00:42:53.470 --> 00:42:53.480 align:start position:0%
I'm directing this you or the entire
 
00:42:55.510 --> 00:42:55.520 align:start position:0%
Committee just a little bit of a
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
different standpoint on this my
 
00:43:00.829 --> 00:43:00.839 align:start position:0%
understanding is that um many children
 
00:43:03.190 --> 00:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
by third grade right they'll level out
 
00:43:05.109 --> 00:43:05.119 align:start position:0%
whether it's half day for example or
 
00:43:08.069 --> 00:43:08.079 align:start position:0%
full day kindergarten um kindergarten
 
00:43:10.309 --> 00:43:10.319 align:start position:0%
was originally developed really to be
 
00:43:12.710 --> 00:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
play-based and to socialize and these
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
days I think we're pushing kids further
 
00:43:17.109 --> 00:43:17.119 align:start position:0%
and further to learn right addition
 
00:43:18.870 --> 00:43:18.880 align:start position:0%
possibly subtraction in kindergarten and
 
00:43:23.109 --> 00:43:23.119 align:start position:0%
reading um I feel or I'm wondering if
 
00:43:25.470 --> 00:43:25.480 align:start position:0%
pushing this at a kindergarten level are
 
00:43:28.910 --> 00:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
we pushing children to learn at a much
 
00:43:31.309 --> 00:43:31.319 align:start position:0%
more rapid level that maybe they're not
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
necessarily ready for or you understand
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying I don't I don't know
 
00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:37.400 align:start position:0%
isn't kind wasn't kindergarten
 
00:43:39.510 --> 00:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
originally meant to be socializing and
 
00:43:41.589 --> 00:43:41.599 align:start position:0%
now we're pushing these children further
 
00:43:43.150 --> 00:43:43.160 align:start position:0%
and further I'm just concerned about
 
00:43:45.750 --> 00:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
undo pressure with a reading program
 
00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
such as this or literacy excuse me
 
00:43:51.109 --> 00:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's a tough one to answer I have four
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
grandchildren and let me say it's very
 
00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:55.480 align:start position:0%
different than it was in my day when I
 
00:43:57.750 --> 00:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
was read when I was
 
00:44:01.750 --> 00:44:01.760 align:start position:0%
educating and and uh supporting my kids
 
00:44:04.670 --> 00:44:04.680 align:start position:0%
I think because it's 15 minutes and when
 
00:44:08.109 --> 00:44:08.119 align:start position:0%
you actually look at the program it's
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
interactive and so I think what this
 
00:44:13.349 --> 00:44:13.359 align:start position:0%
program is only trying to do is be a
 
00:44:18.109 --> 00:44:18.119 align:start position:0%
supplement to either preschool or at
 
00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:21.240 align:start position:0%
home play or at home learning Etc be a
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
supplement that just gets the kids so
 
00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:27.119 align:start position:0%
they are ready to learn it's not teach
 
00:44:29.990 --> 00:44:30.000 align:start position:0%
teaching them specifically to read but
 
00:44:32.829 --> 00:44:32.839 align:start position:0%
it's teaching them the fundamentals it's
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
really called I think it's really the
 
00:44:38.589 --> 00:44:38.599 align:start position:0%
science of reading it's really getting
 
00:44:41.230 --> 00:44:41.240 align:start position:0%
them prepared so that when they go to
 
00:44:45.390 --> 00:44:45.400 align:start position:0%
kindergarten they are they are they they
 
00:44:47.670 --> 00:44:47.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're I guess the only word to
 
00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:50.280 align:start position:0%
use is they're ready I mean I certainly
 
00:44:52.030 --> 00:44:52.040 align:start position:0%
know I had a granddaughter who was
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
miserable because she went to
 
00:44:57.030 --> 00:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
kindergarten and couldn't read and and
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
everybody else could and it was really
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
tough and I wish in this case we'd had
 
00:45:04.270 --> 00:45:04.280 align:start position:0%
Waterford so she could have at least had
 
00:45:09.030 --> 00:45:09.040 align:start position:0%
the the the the background um but but
 
00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:12.520 align:start position:0%
it's it's meant to be 15 minutes 5 days
 
00:45:14.430 --> 00:45:14.440 align:start position:0%
a week and it's really meant to be a
 
00:45:16.990 --> 00:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
supplement so they are ready to read
 
00:45:18.670 --> 00:45:18.680 align:start position:0%
they're excited and the results have
 
00:45:22.470 --> 00:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
been have been positive for the kids and
 
00:45:25.549 --> 00:45:25.559 align:start position:0%
I think if I remember correctly Rob told
 
00:45:27.950 --> 00:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
you about and you can repeat it cuz I'm
 
00:45:30.309 --> 00:45:30.319 align:start position:0%
getting it secondhand about a child who
 
00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
did Waterford here and then went to
 
00:45:34.829 --> 00:45:34.839 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts I hadn't heard that before
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
yeah and it sounded like the child was
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
ahead as far as ready to learn yeah what
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
selling thank you and this is more for
 
00:45:48.990 --> 00:45:49.000 align:start position:0%
the committee but I just wanted to Echo
 
00:45:50.790 --> 00:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
representative lichfield's concern about
 
00:45:52.589 --> 00:45:52.599 align:start position:0%
pressures I think back to when I was
 
00:45:56.230 --> 00:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
teaching kindergarten um granted 23
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
years 2
 
00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of years ago May 34 years ago um
 
00:46:02.710 --> 00:46:02.720 align:start position:0%
it was the late 1990s sorry um math
 
00:46:05.710 --> 00:46:05.720 align:start position:0%
clearly is not my my forte and was not I
 
00:46:07.589 --> 00:46:07.599 align:start position:0%
was an English teacher later and not a a
 
00:46:09.910 --> 00:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
math teacher but you know my
 
00:46:11.790 --> 00:46:11.800 align:start position:0%
kindergarteners came in we had a class
 
00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:16.319 align:start position:0%
of 18 17 of them came in not reading um
 
00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:19.119 align:start position:0%
17 of them went out reading and the one
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
child who didn't was our youngest
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
kindergartner barely uh was on the cusp
 
00:46:27.309 --> 00:46:27.319 align:start position:0%
in terms of age appropriateness to go
 
00:46:29.430 --> 00:46:29.440 align:start position:0%
into first grade the following year and
 
00:46:31.790 --> 00:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
ultimately his parent because his school
 
00:46:33.030 --> 00:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
district then opened a full day
 
00:46:35.790 --> 00:46:35.800 align:start position:0%
kindergarten made the decision to have
 
00:46:38.309 --> 00:46:38.319 align:start position:0%
him repeat kindergarten um and he was
 
00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:40.359 align:start position:0%
reading within two months but he wasn't
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
ready you know he just wasn't
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
developmentally ready and I I I support
 
00:46:48.349 --> 00:46:48.359 align:start position:0%
the concept of the bill I support the
 
00:46:50.230 --> 00:46:50.240 align:start position:0%
idea of having additional Reading
 
00:46:52.390 --> 00:46:52.400 align:start position:0%
Readiness and learning Readiness
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
programs I personally would rather
 
00:46:56.870 --> 00:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
dedicate our money to Universal educ uh
 
00:46:58.270 --> 00:46:58.280 align:start position:0%
preschool for all children because I
 
00:47:00.390 --> 00:47:00.400 align:start position:0%
think that play-based interaction and
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
socialization is crucial and and through
 
00:47:05.190 --> 00:47:05.200 align:start position:0%
those we develop the skills for
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
school-based Readiness um I'll support
 
00:47:09.790 --> 00:47:09.800 align:start position:0%
the bill because I also think literacy
 
00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
is crucial um but I wish that we could
 
00:47:14.230 --> 00:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
dedicate money instead to programs like
 
00:47:16.670 --> 00:47:16.680 align:start position:0%
in Maine when I I live on a Border Town
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
so my daughter was born in Maine and
 
00:47:20.589 --> 00:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
they sent me home with a huge tote bag
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
full of books um from birth through
 
00:47:25.069 --> 00:47:25.079 align:start position:0%
kindergarten age appropriate for me to
 
00:47:26.950 --> 00:47:26.960 align:start position:0%
be able to share with my child with
 
00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
followup about how to use those books
 
00:47:31.510 --> 00:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
and I I wish we would consider I wish we
 
00:47:32.870 --> 00:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
had the money and the resources to be
 
00:47:34.630 --> 00:47:34.640 align:start position:0%
able to provide all of those things for
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
our families
 
00:47:39.349 --> 00:47:39.359 align:start position:0%
instead thank you um see no further
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you oh one more rep try
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so can you just clear up this
 
00:47:47.349 --> 00:47:47.359 align:start position:0%
is a voluntary program it's not like
 
00:47:49.150 --> 00:47:49.160 align:start position:0%
everybody has to do it yes it's totally
 
00:47:51.349 --> 00:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
a voluntary it's a it's a choice Pro
 
00:47:53.309 --> 00:47:53.319 align:start position:0%
when I say choice is the parent chooses
 
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
to do it or the preschool chooses to do
 
00:47:59.309 --> 00:47:59.319 align:start position:0%
it yes it is it is a choice it is it is
 
00:48:01.549 --> 00:48:01.559 align:start position:0%
voluntary you're
 
00:48:03.510 --> 00:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
welcome represent
 
00:48:07.990 --> 00:48:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:11.910 --> 00:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chair um I I I
 
00:48:13.870 --> 00:48:13.880 align:start position:0%
want to stress I know it says it in here
 
00:48:15.990 --> 00:48:16.000 align:start position:0%
anywh but literacy is not only reading
 
00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know I watched some of the videos
 
00:48:20.230 --> 00:48:20.240 align:start position:0%
from Waterford um they were not
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
stressful on kids but it was showing
 
00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:24.200 align:start position:0%
them how to count but it was like
 
00:48:26.829 --> 00:48:26.839 align:start position:0%
dancing and whatnot and yes it is
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
technology but um I think it can't hurt
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
right I mean it was it was math literacy
 
00:48:36.829 --> 00:48:36.839 align:start position:0%
reading whatnot so um I I have to say
 
00:48:38.390 --> 00:48:38.400 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of this
 
00:48:41.670 --> 00:48:41.680 align:start position:0%

motion thank you Mr chair um uh other
 
00:49:17.190 --> 00:49:17.200 align:start position:0%
than the initial comments I made which
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
were a little while ago um I I find this
 
00:49:22.630 --> 00:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
bill to be one of the the most positive
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
things we'll do in this committee is to
 
00:49:27.030 --> 00:49:27.040 align:start position:0%
um begin to lay a positive POS
 
00:49:29.829 --> 00:49:29.839 align:start position:0%
foundation for our youngest Learners and
 
00:49:32.670 --> 00:49:32.680 align:start position:0%
um what I what I've seen of this program
 
00:49:34.549 --> 00:49:34.559 align:start position:0%
um I believe that this is something that
 
00:49:36.750 --> 00:49:36.760 align:start position:0%
all four and five year olds will Embrace
 
00:49:39.549 --> 00:49:39.559 align:start position:0%
readily and given the 15 minutes that it
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
entails it won't be a long shot to keep
 
00:49:44.230 --> 00:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
their attention so again I think this is
 
00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
another tool in the toolbox for our
 
00:49:48.069 --> 00:49:48.079 align:start position:0%
youngest Learners and I um
 
00:49:50.670 --> 00:49:50.680 align:start position:0%

motion Valerie would you like to comment
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
on your uh thank you Mr chair I decided
 
00:53:30.710 --> 00:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
to move this bill a to pass because I
 
00:53:32.190 --> 00:53:32.200 align:start position:0%
think it's important we recognize
 
00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution Day and this bill does not
 
00:53:37.150 --> 00:53:37.160 align:start position:0%
prescribe a curriculum and allows for
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
local control in how this should be
 
00:53:40.670 --> 00:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
implemented evening the time that it
 
00:53:43.910 --> 00:53:43.920 align:start position:0%
would take to implement this um and we
 
00:53:46.030 --> 00:53:46.040 align:start position:0%
already do this for Memorial Day and for
 
00:53:48.190 --> 00:53:48.200 align:start position:0%
Veterans Day but whereas Constitution
 
00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
Day falls in September it really sets
 
00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
the tone for the rest of the year in
 
00:53:53.630 --> 00:53:53.640 align:start position:0%
terms of patriotism and really as
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
students as they grow to become
 
00:53:58.589 --> 00:53:58.599 align:start position:0%
adolescents and to as adults even in
 
00:53:59.950 --> 00:53:59.960 align:start position:0%
their rights and responsibilities as
 
00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
Citizens to ensure that foundation so I
 
00:54:05.349 --> 00:54:05.359 align:start position:0%
will move OTP and I would just like to
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
add to the record that there was a mixup
 
00:54:08.950 --> 00:54:08.960 align:start position:0%
with OS but I was meant to be a
 
00:54:10.829 --> 00:54:10.839 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor of this bill but for whatever
 
00:54:15.670 --> 00:54:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:18.990 --> 00:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
you um I'll speak to it
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
just uh I just want to Echo uh
 
00:54:24.910 --> 00:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
representative uh McDonald's remarks in
 
00:54:27.230 --> 00:54:27.240 align:start position:0%
support of um OT
 
00:54:29.230 --> 00:54:29.240 align:start position:0%
and uh to to highlight the fact that
 
00:54:32.230 --> 00:54:32.240 align:start position:0%
this this is the the foundational uh
 
00:54:34.390 --> 00:54:34.400 align:start position:0%
document for our country and so that
 
00:54:37.349 --> 00:54:37.359 align:start position:0%
it's absolutely imperative uh not only
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
that we U devote time in our schools to
 
00:54:42.789 --> 00:54:42.799 align:start position:0%
the study of the document in the history
 
00:54:44.270 --> 00:54:44.280 align:start position:0%
but I think it's just it's very
 
00:54:47.190 --> 00:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
appropriate to uh make sure that we um
 
00:54:49.870 --> 00:54:49.880 align:start position:0%
actually have a a Constitution Day I
 
00:54:52.990 --> 00:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
think this is um this a great Bill thank
 
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
you uh if I'll just uh comment
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
um uh this bill actually is um the first
 
00:55:05.950 --> 00:55:05.960 align:start position:0%
bill I submitted as a legislator back in
 
00:55:09.630 --> 00:55:09.640 align:start position:0%
2012 um it passed the house something in
 
00:55:13.670 --> 00:55:13.680 align:start position:0%
the order of 325 to
 
00:55:17.270 --> 00:55:17.280 align:start position:0%
25 um but was killed in the senate for
 
00:55:20.150 --> 00:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
unknown reasons um which often happens
 
00:55:24.430 --> 00:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
in the Senate um and this bill as
 
00:55:28.029 --> 00:55:28.039 align:start position:0%
presented um is amended based on what we
 
00:55:32.069 --> 00:55:32.079 align:start position:0%
did in the house back then uh to um
 
00:55:36.190 --> 00:55:36.200 align:start position:0%
include um recognition uh as well of the
 
00:55:38.750 --> 00:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution um so that
 
00:55:40.789 --> 00:55:40.799 align:start position:0%
we're we're talking about both because
 
00:55:42.430 --> 00:55:42.440 align:start position:0%
this is talking about really Federal
 
00:55:45.990 --> 00:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
Constitution Day which is September 17th
 
00:55:50.710 --> 00:55:50.720 align:start position:0%
uh of each year so um I would love to

00:55:59.150 --> 00:55:59.160 align:start position:0%

00:56:26.789 --> 00:56:26.799 align:start position:0%
bill as necessary she talked about how
 
00:56:28.390 --> 00:56:28.400 align:start position:0%
in her kindergarten classes she Begins
 
00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.880 align:start position:0%
the Year by teaching kids how to say the
 
00:56:31.710 --> 00:56:31.720 align:start position:0%
Pledge of Allegiance and because she's
 
00:56:33.829 --> 00:56:33.839 align:start position:0%
teaching them how to say it she spends a
 
00:56:35.349 --> 00:56:35.359 align:start position:0%
lot of time explaining what it is and
 
00:56:36.910 --> 00:56:36.920 align:start position:0%
how it works and she knows that that
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
process continues through the
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
kindergarten classes across the district
 
00:56:42.270 --> 00:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
as well as the first and second grade
 
00:56:43.589 --> 00:56:43.599 align:start position:0%
classes across the district because the
 
00:56:45.349 --> 00:56:45.359 align:start position:0%
kids don't remember when they come back
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
what those things mean so they spend
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
that time in the element Early
 
00:56:49.990 --> 00:56:50.000 align:start position:0%
Elementary years going through this
 
00:56:52.270 --> 00:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
process and at our um upper school
 
00:56:53.870 --> 00:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
levels we also incorporate civic
 
00:56:55.510 --> 00:56:55.520 align:start position:0%
education which goes through the same
 
00:56:57.789 --> 00:56:57.799 align:start position:0%
information and so it wasn't that there
 
00:57:00.029 --> 00:57:00.039 align:start position:0%
was opposition to the concept it was
 
00:57:02.069 --> 00:57:02.079 align:start position:0%
just that it's already being done and
 
00:57:04.150 --> 00:57:04.160 align:start position:0%
that an additional mandate wasn't
 
00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:05.670 align:start position:0%
that an additional mandate wasn't
necessary

00:57:05.670 --> 00:57:05.680 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:57:08.670 --> 00:57:08.680 align:start position:0%
so um I I'll just add that I I believe
 
00:57:11.589 --> 00:57:11.599 align:start position:0%
it is um law based on legislation that
 
00:57:13.829 --> 00:57:13.839 align:start position:0%
was passed several years ago about uh
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
explaining the uh pledge of allegiance
 
00:57:20.109 --> 00:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
to classes um as well so I'm I'm very
 
00:57:22.309 --> 00:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
happy to hear that uh something that
 
00:57:24.829 --> 00:57:24.839 align:start position:0%
we've passed is uh actually being done
 
00:57:27.349 --> 00:57:27.359 align:start position:0%
uh always good to know
 
00:57:31.589 --> 00:57:31.599 align:start position:0%

01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:23.719 --> 01:19:53.629 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:19:53.629 --> 01:19:53.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:53.639 --> 01:20:23.629 align:start position:0%
 
e

01:20:23.629 --> 01:20:23.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:59.430 --> 01:20:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:01.830 --> 01:21:01.840 align:start position:0%

01:21:12.149 --> 01:21:12.159 align:start position:0%

chairman uh we'll open the executive
 
01:21:23.669 --> 01:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
session on HB 208 and I recognize
 
01:21:26.189 --> 01:21:26.199 align:start position:0%
representative Cordell for a motion uh
 
01:21:29.750 --> 01:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
thank you I would move uh a to
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
pass and would then like to offer an
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
amendment as well do we have a second on
 
01:21:39.310 --> 01:21:39.320 align:start position:0%
the a to pass a secondes oh oh I'm sorry
 
01:21:41.149 --> 01:21:41.159 align:start position:0%
I not representative
 
01:21:45.870 --> 01:21:45.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:49.229 --> 01:21:49.239 align:start position:0%
you um I I representative litfield did
 
01:21:50.510 --> 01:21:50.520 align:start position:0%
did you have an amendment that you
 
01:21:56.149 --> 01:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:00.320 align:start position:0%
the amendment is uh
 
01:22:03.870 --> 01:22:03.880 align:start position:0%
338 and um just simply this bill allows
 
01:22:05.430 --> 01:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
the superintendent and School Board to
 
01:22:07.390 --> 01:22:07.400 align:start position:0%
nominate and appoint a school nurse who
 
01:22:09.510 --> 01:22:09.520 align:start position:0%
must be licensed and registered with the
 
01:22:11.790 --> 01:22:11.800 align:start position:0%
Board of Nursing so at this point in
 
01:22:13.470 --> 01:22:13.480 align:start position:0%
time we receive testimony from the
 
01:22:15.669 --> 01:22:15.679 align:start position:0%
Department of Education that they're not
 
01:22:18.070 --> 01:22:18.080 align:start position:0%
in the business of doing licensing for
 
01:22:21.390 --> 01:22:21.400 align:start position:0%
nurses so they would prefer not to have
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
that responsibility it's not necessarily
 
01:22:25.070 --> 01:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate are you are you entering a
 
01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:28.320 align:start position:0%
motion on the I that
 
01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.990 --> 01:22:39.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:42.310 --> 01:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
amendment representative so I I'm just
 
01:22:44.310 --> 01:22:44.320 align:start position:0%
trying to understand why in the
 
01:22:46.149 --> 01:22:46.159 align:start position:0%
amendment we would take out any
 
01:22:47.790 --> 01:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
requirement for the person to have any
 
01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:59.629 --> 01:22:59.639 align:start position:0%
repres litfield sorry so we have a
 
01:23:02.310 --> 01:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
nursing shortage at this point in time
 
01:23:04.669 --> 01:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
so this is going to help us to fill that
 
01:23:06.390 --> 01:23:06.400 align:start position:0%
need I don't know that they necessarily
 
01:23:08.709 --> 01:23:08.719 align:start position:0%
need to have it it was too narrow of a
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
hole for people to fit into I don't
 
01:23:12.510 --> 01:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
think they necessarily need pediatric to
 
01:23:14.590 --> 01:23:14.600 align:start position:0%
be in the
 
01:23:17.750 --> 01:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
schools representative Murray thank you
 
01:23:22.870 --> 01:23:22.880 align:start position:0%
um Madam Vice chair chair sorry um so I
 
01:23:25.470 --> 01:23:25.480 align:start position:0%
share a similar concern with Ard to um
 
01:23:28.110 --> 01:23:28.120 align:start position:0%
the replace all um and eliminating some
 
01:23:30.110 --> 01:23:30.120 align:start position:0%
of the requirements to ensure that we
 
01:23:32.629 --> 01:23:32.639 align:start position:0%
have um somebody who is well versed in
 
01:23:34.550 --> 01:23:34.560 align:start position:0%
the complex nature of students who come
 
01:23:37.830 --> 01:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
into our doors even as as little ones um
 
01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:39.560 align:start position:0%
we're seeing more and more medically
 
01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
complex students um and I would want to
 
01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:46.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that whomever is in that role is
 
01:23:49.590 --> 01:23:49.600 align:start position:0%
well versed in whether it's GI tubes or
 
01:23:53.030 --> 01:23:53.040 align:start position:0%
it's a fe a fever um that we're ensuring
 
01:23:58.629 --> 01:23:58.639 align:start position:0%
that those types of things are are are
 
01:24:01.709 --> 01:24:01.719 align:start position:0%
being enumerated within and I think the
 
01:24:04.669 --> 01:24:04.679 align:start position:0%
previous statute had some of that in
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
there like representative celik had
 
01:24:09.350 --> 01:24:09.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned representative
 
01:24:11.310 --> 01:24:11.320 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair I'd like
 
01:24:14.790 --> 01:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
to point out to um my colleagues uh line
 
01:24:18.390 --> 01:24:18.400 align:start position:0%
two that says have three years acute of
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
chronic care current experience with the
 
01:24:24.590 --> 01:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
about the amendment am
 
01:24:28.070 --> 01:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
oh I am so sorry please I apologize
 
01:24:32.030 --> 01:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
profusely and I I don't know where my I
 
01:24:35.629 --> 01:24:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:35.639 --> 01:24:37.470 align:start position:0%
 
apologize

01:24:37.470 --> 01:24:37.480 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
01:24:41.470 --> 01:24:41.480 align:start position:0%
do representative litfield I just so
 
01:24:43.709 --> 01:24:43.719 align:start position:0%
walk me through this so we have a school
 
01:24:46.229 --> 01:24:46.239 align:start position:0%
nurse who's going to be a registered
 
01:24:48.709 --> 01:24:48.719 align:start position:0%
professional nurse who is currently
 
01:24:51.070 --> 01:24:51.080 align:start position:0%
licensed what what would make her not
 
01:24:52.870 --> 01:24:52.880 align:start position:0%
qualified to take care of the school
 
01:24:52.880 --> 01:24:55.070 align:start position:0%
qualified to take care of the school
population

01:24:55.070 --> 01:24:55.080 align:start position:0%
population
 
01:24:56.350 --> 01:24:56.360 align:start position:0%
you you're not going to have someone
 
01:24:59.430 --> 01:24:59.440 align:start position:0%
specialized in absolutely everything
 
01:25:02.709 --> 01:25:02.719 align:start position:0%
represent Murray thank you madam chair
 
01:25:05.790 --> 01:25:05.800 align:start position:0%
um to that end I think that um
 
01:25:07.709 --> 01:25:07.719 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman started to talk
 
01:25:09.189 --> 01:25:09.199 align:start position:0%
about the acute and chronic care
 
01:25:11.350 --> 01:25:11.360 align:start position:0%
training there are other training
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
modalities for individuals who are
 
01:25:17.149 --> 01:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
medically complex those children go to
 
01:25:19.270 --> 01:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
our schools and are in our school
 
01:25:21.270 --> 01:25:21.280 align:start position:0%
communities and so I would want to make
 
01:25:24.790 --> 01:25:24.800 align:start position:0%
sure that that was there STI ulated
 
01:25:26.950 --> 01:25:26.960 align:start position:0%
somewhere and this this amendment as
 
01:25:30.149 --> 01:25:30.159 align:start position:0%
proposed is a replace
 
01:25:32.470 --> 01:25:32.480 align:start position:0%
all representative
 
01:25:35.229 --> 01:25:35.239 align:start position:0%
litfield so just going back to we always
 
01:25:37.790 --> 01:25:37.800 align:start position:0%
go back to local control right if these
 
01:25:40.390 --> 01:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
are very specific situations so if that
 
01:25:42.870 --> 01:25:42.880 align:start position:0%
were to happen within any school
 
01:25:45.189 --> 01:25:45.199 align:start position:0%
district within that population wouldn't
 
01:25:47.030 --> 01:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
it be up to whether it be the building
 
01:25:49.030 --> 01:25:49.040 align:start position:0%
principal or the superintendent to
 
01:25:51.910 --> 01:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
ensure that that particular nurse is
 
01:25:53.470 --> 01:25:53.480 align:start position:0%
well versed in what is happening
 
01:25:54.750 --> 01:25:54.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they just wouldn't they
 
01:25:56.590 --> 01:25:56.600 align:start position:0%
naturally do that in order to take care
 
01:25:57.669 --> 01:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
of the
 
01:26:00.990 --> 01:26:01.000 align:start position:0%
population represent Murray um thank you
 
01:26:04.910 --> 01:26:04.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair and and I I share the same
 
01:26:08.109 --> 01:26:08.119 align:start position:0%
concern yet again uh to the sponsor of
 
01:26:10.430 --> 01:26:10.440 align:start position:0%
the amendment's position that if the
 
01:26:12.229 --> 01:26:12.239 align:start position:0%
district is not in the or the State
 
01:26:13.830 --> 01:26:13.840 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is not in the
 
01:26:17.629 --> 01:26:17.639 align:start position:0%
business of providing a lure for nursing
 
01:26:20.350 --> 01:26:20.360 align:start position:0%
and so therefore removed that component
 
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
we would want to make sure that
 
01:26:24.550 --> 01:26:24.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere within the state statute we
 
01:26:27.430 --> 01:26:27.440 align:start position:0%
are enumerating chronic and acute care
 
01:26:29.870 --> 01:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
as being a modality that our nurses have
 
01:26:29.880 --> 01:26:32.510 align:start position:0%
as being a modality that our nurses have
experienced

01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
experienced
 
01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:35.320 align:start position:0%
on representative Freeman thank you
 
01:26:39.149 --> 01:26:39.159 align:start position:0%
madam chair and um before I misspoke um
 
01:26:41.189 --> 01:26:41.199 align:start position:0%
a little background on me I spent 35
 
01:26:43.310 --> 01:26:43.320 align:start position:0%
years um as an occupational therapist
 
01:26:45.030 --> 01:26:45.040 align:start position:0%
and had an opportunity to work with many
 
01:26:48.030 --> 01:26:48.040 align:start position:0%
many nurses and the Very things that um
 
01:26:50.030 --> 01:26:50.040 align:start position:0%
representative Murray is concerned about
 
01:26:51.870 --> 01:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
are the very things that these nurses
 
01:26:55.109 --> 01:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
are so intimately trained trained on
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
from day one of their nursing experience
 
01:27:01.669 --> 01:27:01.679 align:start position:0%
um additionally I would say that um
 
01:27:03.629 --> 01:27:03.639 align:start position:0%
there would be a criteria based on what
 
01:27:05.189 --> 01:27:05.199 align:start position:0%
the superintendent and the district
 
01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
would need as far as nurses go and it
 
01:27:10.590 --> 01:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
would be their decision if a nurse did
 
01:27:12.709 --> 01:27:12.719 align:start position:0%
meet the qualifications you're always
 
01:27:14.470 --> 01:27:14.480 align:start position:0%
going to come up on instances where a
 
01:27:16.629 --> 01:27:16.639 align:start position:0%
child is admitted who has complex
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
medical needs and that would be the
 
01:27:20.950 --> 01:27:20.960 align:start position:0%
district's responsibility to fill that
 
01:27:23.510 --> 01:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
need instead of hamstringing them and
 
01:27:26.070 --> 01:27:26.080 align:start position:0%
having a school nurse so I would support
 
01:27:27.950 --> 01:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
this amendment again I I did speak out
 
01:27:30.030 --> 01:27:30.040 align:start position:0%
of turn initially I did not see the
 
01:27:32.390 --> 01:27:32.400 align:start position:0%
amendment I'm just catching up to speed
 
01:27:34.830 --> 01:27:34.840 align:start position:0%
um but I we we need to loosen the
 
01:27:36.510 --> 01:27:36.520 align:start position:0%
shackles on these school districts they
 
01:27:39.709 --> 01:27:39.719 align:start position:0%
need to have School nurses and um the
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
districts know what they need and they
 
01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
will act in the most prudent and um uh
 
01:27:47.390 --> 01:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
best interest of the students so I will
 
01:27:49.709 --> 01:27:49.719 align:start position:0%
support this amendment as well as this
 
01:27:52.109 --> 01:27:52.119 align:start position:0%

01:28:49.109 --> 01:28:49.119 align:start position:0%
you or not yeah I think she said yes
 
01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
yes representative cordelli uh thank you
 
01:28:56.350 --> 01:28:56.360 align:start position:0%
um we've gone around and around and
 
01:28:58.950 --> 01:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
around with School nurses for multiple
 
01:29:04.109 --> 01:29:04.119 align:start position:0%
terms um and as I recall the um last
 
01:29:07.950 --> 01:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
bill uh like this um we had testimony
 
01:29:12.470 --> 01:29:12.480 align:start position:0%
that um one the department um is really
 
01:29:16.109 --> 01:29:16.119 align:start position:0%
not um they don't consider themselves
 
01:29:20.510 --> 01:29:20.520 align:start position:0%
some themselves qualified uh to certify
 
01:29:23.030 --> 01:29:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh nurses um but also the fact that
 
01:29:24.990 --> 01:29:25.000 align:start position:0%
there is a cost in involved the
 
01:29:27.790 --> 01:29:27.800 align:start position:0%
retirement cost a retirement cost in the
 
01:29:31.510 --> 01:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
district goes up uh for anyone who's
 
01:29:33.990 --> 01:29:34.000 align:start position:0%
certified um so there would be a
 
01:29:36.990 --> 01:29:37.000 align:start position:0%
lessening of of cost to the district um
 
01:29:38.229 --> 01:29:38.239 align:start position:0%
without that
 
01:29:40.790 --> 01:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
certification and uh I don't see that
 
01:29:43.350 --> 01:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
the certification by the Department of
 
01:29:47.430 --> 01:29:47.440 align:start position:0%
Education um really provides anything um
 
01:29:50.510 --> 01:29:50.520 align:start position:0%
to the process um that can't be uh
 
01:29:53.030 --> 01:29:53.040 align:start position:0%
vetted out in uh the school hiring
 
01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:56.189 align:start position:0%

uh the the proposed bill um actually
 
01:31:14.430 --> 01:31:14.440 align:start position:0%
only uh is appr applies to certain
 
01:31:17.950 --> 01:31:17.960 align:start position:0%
sections um as you can see on 229 there
 
01:31:21.550 --> 01:31:21.560 align:start position:0%
there's a whole list of qualifications
 
01:31:26.229 --> 01:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
that School nurses uh uh should have um
 
01:31:27.990 --> 01:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm just looking here at the
 
01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
testimony from um the chair of the New
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire school Nurses
 
01:31:36.629 --> 01:31:36.639 align:start position:0%
Association and they were they were
 
01:31:40.109 --> 01:31:40.119 align:start position:0%
supportive of making having
 
01:31:44.390 --> 01:31:44.400 align:start position:0%
legislation um that makes it easier for
 
01:31:46.390 --> 01:31:46.400 align:start position:0%
um for nurses to get
 
01:31:48.590 --> 01:31:48.600 align:start position:0%
certification in fact it says the school
 
01:31:50.550 --> 01:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
Nurses Association strongly supports
 
01:31:52.629 --> 01:31:52.639 align:start position:0%
certification and supports legislation
 
01:31:55.109 --> 01:31:55.119 align:start position:0%
that makes certification accessible to
 
01:31:56.830 --> 01:31:56.840 align:start position:0%
nurses who are committed to practicing
 
01:32:00.669 --> 01:32:00.679 align:start position:0%
in schools um this bill takes all that
 
01:32:05.070 --> 01:32:05.080 align:start position:0%
away so I I I'm wondering did you ask or
 
01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
has this been um ploted by the New
 
01:32:13.310 --> 01:32:13.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
Association the amendment that we asking
 
01:32:19.910 --> 01:32:19.920 align:start position:0%

01:32:21.390 --> 01:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
representative lal's Amendment I'm
 
01:32:24.189 --> 01:32:24.199 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have reached out to the
 
01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire school Nurses
 
01:32:27.910 --> 01:32:27.920 align:start position:0%
Association to get feedback on this one
 
01:32:29.629 --> 01:32:29.639 align:start position:0%
I have not I just sat through their
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:34.560 --> 01:32:36.070 align:start position:0%
 
hearing

01:32:36.070 --> 01:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
represent thank you again I just keep
 
01:32:43.830 --> 01:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
coming back to not requiring or um in or
 
01:32:45.790 --> 01:32:45.800 align:start position:0%
at least a preference for people with
 
01:32:47.870 --> 01:32:47.880 align:start position:0%
pediatric experience I think about
 
01:32:50.109 --> 01:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
especially at the elementary level so
 
01:32:52.629 --> 01:32:52.639 align:start position:0%
many of our youngest children Express
 
01:32:54.350 --> 01:32:54.360 align:start position:0%
things that are not actually medical
 
01:32:57.390 --> 01:32:57.400 align:start position:0%
needs but as medical issues they might
 
01:33:00.669 --> 01:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
be feeling anxiety they might be feeling
 
01:33:02.350 --> 01:33:02.360 align:start position:0%
other areas and it gets expressed as
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
stomach aches or headaches or other
 
01:33:07.070 --> 01:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
kinds of seemingly physical ailments
 
01:33:08.669 --> 01:33:08.679 align:start position:0%
that are ultimately really what they
 
01:33:10.030 --> 01:33:10.040 align:start position:0%
need as a hug and
 
01:33:14.470 --> 01:33:14.480 align:start position:0%
reassurance and I
 
01:33:18.189 --> 01:33:18.199 align:start position:0%
I am concerned that someone who maybe
 
01:33:20.470 --> 01:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
only has experience as an anesthesiology
 
01:33:22.470 --> 01:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
nurse which is a very specific and
 
01:33:24.750 --> 01:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
specified training requires I think it's
 
01:33:26.310 --> 01:33:26.320 align:start position:0%
four years of additional training Beyond
 
01:33:28.910 --> 01:33:28.920 align:start position:0%
a ba and nursing or someone who's only
 
01:33:31.950 --> 01:33:31.960 align:start position:0%
ever worked with patients in uh an
 
01:33:34.910 --> 01:33:34.920 align:start position:0%
elderly care facility who then says well
 
01:33:36.910 --> 01:33:36.920 align:start position:0%
you know I I can retire from that and go
 
01:33:40.430 --> 01:33:40.440 align:start position:0%
work as a school nurse but has no no
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
practical or relational experience with
 
01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%
children yes they might be able to
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
handle broken bones and they may be able
 
01:33:49.990 --> 01:33:50.000 align:start position:0%
to handle bloody knees but without
 
01:33:52.350 --> 01:33:52.360 align:start position:0%
having had any training at all in
 
01:33:54.830 --> 01:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
Pediatrics or experience
 
01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:56.440 align:start position:0%
or someone who's this would make someone
 
01:33:58.270 --> 01:33:58.280 align:start position:0%
who's you know graduated a week ago
 
01:34:00.430 --> 01:34:00.440 align:start position:0%
eligible and I'm not sure if that's what
 
01:34:03.830 --> 01:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
children representative
 
01:34:08.790 --> 01:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
dry thank you I think this is when the
 
01:34:10.990 --> 01:34:11.000 align:start position:0%
local school district would examine that
 
01:34:12.470 --> 01:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
and make a decision as to whether this
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
was a appropriate person to be a school
 
01:34:18.750 --> 01:34:18.760 align:start position:0%
nurse representative Morse uh just a
 
01:34:20.270 --> 01:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
quick comment with the shortage of
 
01:34:21.470 --> 01:34:21.480 align:start position:0%
nurses that we have throughout the
 
01:34:23.310 --> 01:34:23.320 align:start position:0%
entire State I would rather have this
 
01:34:26.189 --> 01:34:26.199 align:start position:0%
pass and have a certified licensed
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
teacher or school nurse sorry um in our
 
01:34:31.550 --> 01:34:31.560 align:start position:0%
schools than to not have one at all
 
01:34:33.629 --> 01:34:33.639 align:start position:0%
because they can't find someone who
 
01:34:37.790 --> 01:34:37.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:40.350 --> 01:34:40.360 align:start position:0%
definitions it's just my take
 
01:34:42.990 --> 01:34:43.000 align:start position:0%
representative Hall so I'm definitely
 
01:34:45.510 --> 01:34:45.520 align:start position:0%
against the amendment but I'm curious if
 
01:34:47.669 --> 01:34:47.679 align:start position:0%
you folks like representative lville to
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
say do you see
 
01:34:52.149 --> 01:34:52.159 align:start position:0%
the original Bill do you see that as
 
01:34:55.750 --> 01:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
watering down the certification you know
 
01:34:57.310 --> 01:34:57.320 align:start position:0%
watering making it e do you see the
 
01:35:00.390 --> 01:35:00.400 align:start position:0%
original Bill making it easier to hire
 
01:35:00.400 --> 01:35:06.149 align:start position:0%
original Bill making it easier to hire
School

01:35:06.149 --> 01:35:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
nurses I don't know if I would if I
 
01:35:11.550 --> 01:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
would say the word easier but um but yes
 
01:35:14.189 --> 01:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
I think we are enabling lo I I think
 
01:35:16.750 --> 01:35:16.760 align:start position:0%
we're enabling local control and I'm so
 
01:35:18.510 --> 01:35:18.520 align:start position:0%
confused about I understand what you're
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
saying but we're not going to hire a
 
01:35:25.750 --> 01:35:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
no because that's for the parents so in
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
my opinion the principal the
 
01:35:31.910 --> 01:35:31.920 align:start position:0%
superintendent the people at the local
 
01:35:33.870 --> 01:35:33.880 align:start position:0%
level they are going to know what best
 
01:35:35.870 --> 01:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
suits their school every school
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
Community is different and I trust that
 
01:35:39.669 --> 01:35:39.679 align:start position:0%
they're not going to pick someone that's
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
school represent Freeman thank you madam
 
01:35:48.709 --> 01:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
chair I have to say I'm a little
 
01:35:50.510 --> 01:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
surprised listening to my colleagues
 
01:35:52.590 --> 01:35:52.600 align:start position:0%
talk about nurses like they just don't
 
01:35:54.189 --> 01:35:54.199 align:start position:0%
know what they're doing or that they
 
01:35:57.830 --> 01:35:57.840 align:start position:0%
would even risk their license by taking
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
something on that they didn't understand
 
01:36:03.350 --> 01:36:03.360 align:start position:0%
or had knowledge of they are they are
 
01:36:07.310 --> 01:36:07.320 align:start position:0%
licensed as heavily as as therapists as
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
doctors and they're not going to risk
 
01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:13.639 align:start position:0%
their license on a case or a situation
 
01:36:16.629 --> 01:36:16.639 align:start position:0%
where they could um be held liable so
 
01:36:19.870 --> 01:36:19.880 align:start position:0%
I'm a little surprised um to hear the
 
01:36:23.109 --> 01:36:23.119 align:start position:0%
lack of confidence in our nurses overall
 
01:36:26.590 --> 01:36:26.600 align:start position:0%
and school nurse and a school nurse is
 
01:36:28.709 --> 01:36:28.719 align:start position:0%
school excuse me well hold on what is
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
the point of order the point of order is
 
01:36:33.070 --> 01:36:33.080 align:start position:0%
youing motive to the membership over on
 
01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
this side as not caring about nurses
 
01:36:38.109 --> 01:36:38.119 align:start position:0%
that is inappropriate I I I I disagree
 
01:36:40.070 --> 01:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not ascribing I'm not ascribing to
 
01:36:42.430 --> 01:36:42.440 align:start position:0%
any side I'm I'm merely making a comment
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
about a comment that was made I am not
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not attacking anyone or going after
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
any side I was just very surprised to
 
01:36:51.709 --> 01:36:51.719 align:start position:0%
hear the lack of confidence in our
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
school nurses Maybe want to express it
 
01:36:56.189 --> 01:36:56.199 align:start position:0%
that you have confidence in our school
 
01:36:57.470 --> 01:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
nurses I have a huge amount of
 
01:36:59.310 --> 01:36:59.320 align:start position:0%
confidence in our school nurses as well
 
01:37:01.550 --> 01:37:01.560 align:start position:0%
as the administration that hires those
 
01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
School nurses thank
 
01:37:06.550 --> 01:37:06.560 align:start position:0%
you uh repesent
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
run thank you um I know I'm just a sub
 
01:37:13.470 --> 01:37:13.480 align:start position:0%
today but um we voted on a bill to
 
01:37:17.109 --> 01:37:17.119 align:start position:0%
mandate patriotic education during for
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
constitutional day and yet we don't want
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
to mandate standards for School nurses
 
01:37:24.669 --> 01:37:24.679 align:start position:0%
so I just want to to point out it that
 
01:37:26.430 --> 01:37:26.440 align:start position:0%
seems a little hypocritical for me if
 
01:37:28.870 --> 01:37:28.880 align:start position:0%
anything we should care about making
 
01:37:30.590 --> 01:37:30.600 align:start position:0%
sure that the people that are providing
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
Health Care to our children meet uh
 
01:37:37.510 --> 01:37:37.520 align:start position:0%
qualifications thank you representative
 
01:37:40.270 --> 01:37:40.280 align:start position:0%
s thank you I just I just want to go
 
01:37:43.149 --> 01:37:43.159 align:start position:0%
back it's our the School nurses that I
 
01:37:45.390 --> 01:37:45.400 align:start position:0%
have encountered both in my years as a
 
01:37:48.950 --> 01:37:48.960 align:start position:0%
teacher as well as in my years as a
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
parent we have outstanding School nurses
 
01:37:55.310 --> 01:37:55.320 align:start position:0%
who have training in working with
 
01:37:58.030 --> 01:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
children and they are very different
 
01:38:00.030 --> 01:38:00.040 align:start position:0%
than the people who I've interacted with
 
01:38:01.629 --> 01:38:01.639 align:start position:0%
in medical settings when I have gone
 
01:38:04.189 --> 01:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
with my parents to Medical um
 
01:38:06.189 --> 01:38:06.199 align:start position:0%
appointments who've worked with them and
 
01:38:07.669 --> 01:38:07.679 align:start position:0%
the types of questions the way they
 
01:38:10.709 --> 01:38:10.719 align:start position:0%
phrase things and how they interact are
 
01:38:12.750 --> 01:38:12.760 align:start position:0%
different that's not to say they're not
 
01:38:14.350 --> 01:38:14.360 align:start position:0%
qualified that's not to say I don't have
 
01:38:15.950 --> 01:38:15.960 align:start position:0%
confidence in their ability to handle
 
01:38:19.750 --> 01:38:19.760 align:start position:0%
certain medical situations I I can't get
 
01:38:20.990 --> 01:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
behind this amendment because I feel
 
01:38:22.830 --> 01:38:22.840 align:start position:0%
like it Waters down the bill too much
 
01:38:24.910 --> 01:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
and takes out many things I don't think
 
01:38:27.709 --> 01:38:27.719 align:start position:0%
that people have to have both a nursing
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
certification and a license sure
 
01:38:32.470 --> 01:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
necessarily from the state but I do
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
think they need to have a nursing
 
01:38:37.390 --> 01:38:37.400 align:start position:0%
license that specifies experience and
 
01:38:41.109 --> 01:38:41.119 align:start position:0%
and training with a pediatric population
 
01:38:43.510 --> 01:38:43.520 align:start position:0%
because I do think I think about you
 
01:38:45.709 --> 01:38:45.719 align:start position:0%
know some of the experiences my own
 
01:38:48.229 --> 01:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
children had with the nurses and the
 
01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
level of complexity that involved and
 
01:38:52.030 --> 01:38:52.040 align:start position:0%
the ability to understand the
 
01:38:54.310 --> 01:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
developmental stage of children
 
01:38:56.350 --> 01:38:56.360 align:start position:0%
and how they express themselves and that
 
01:38:59.350 --> 01:38:59.360 align:start position:0%
is unique and different from how we talk
 
01:39:01.270 --> 01:39:01.280 align:start position:0%
about people with people in Elder Care
 
01:39:03.510 --> 01:39:03.520 align:start position:0%
that's unique and different from how we
 
01:39:06.629 --> 01:39:06.639 align:start position:0%
talk with our gynecologists or our
 
01:39:08.510 --> 01:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
urologists it's different it's a
 
01:39:09.870 --> 01:39:09.880 align:start position:0%
different level of nursing that's why
 
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
people have different trainings and
 
01:39:13.470 --> 01:39:13.480 align:start position:0%
certifications as nurses I don't think
 
01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
people are going to be giving up their
 
01:39:15.990 --> 01:39:16.000 align:start position:0%
certification to do something they're
 
01:39:18.550 --> 01:39:18.560 align:start position:0%
not qualified for but I worry that the
 
01:39:20.149 --> 01:39:20.159 align:start position:0%
especially the language of this
 
01:39:24.350 --> 01:39:24.360 align:start position:0%
amendment Waters it down too far and so
 
01:39:25.750 --> 01:39:25.760 align:start position:0%
I I can't support the amendment because
 
01:39:28.109 --> 01:39:28.119 align:start position:0%
it feels to me like we're saying well
 
01:39:29.950 --> 01:39:29.960 align:start position:0%
you know okay you're certified to teach
 
01:39:32.350 --> 01:39:32.360 align:start position:0%
High School history you could certainly
 
01:39:34.189 --> 01:39:34.199 align:start position:0%
cover teaching kindergarten having
 
01:39:35.430 --> 01:39:35.440 align:start position:0%
taught both the high school and middle
 
01:39:36.750 --> 01:39:36.760 align:start position:0%
school level there's a reason I had two
 
01:39:36.760 --> 01:39:41.390 align:start position:0%
school level there's a reason I had two
different

01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.669 --> 01:39:43.679 align:start position:0%

take up that was not on the list but um
I

01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%

01:43:06.669 --> 01:43:06.679 align:start position:0%
um yeah right um right and I believe
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
there's agreement to take up a house
 
01:43:10.350 --> 01:43:10.360 align:start position:0%

01:44:19.550 --> 01:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
your motion yes thank you um although I
 
01:44:23.149 --> 01:44:23.159 align:start position:0%
I I don't care for the language in here
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
as far as cutting back on
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
education our kids uh need the education
 
01:44:31.750 --> 01:44:31.760 align:start position:0%
and I see crossover into different
 
01:44:37.229 --> 01:44:37.239 align:start position:0%
subjects where uh it does all interact
 
01:44:40.149 --> 01:44:40.159 align:start position:0%
together at some point
 
01:44:44.709 --> 01:44:44.719 align:start position:0%
um as far as this bill I don't it does
 
01:44:48.350 --> 01:44:48.360 align:start position:0%
not help our students but I just want to
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
say for the Civil lining that I believe
 
01:44:53.589 --> 01:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
that it does bring to the Forefront of
 
01:44:56.270 --> 01:44:56.280 align:start position:0%
the failures that our kids are seeing
 
01:44:58.709 --> 01:44:58.719 align:start position:0%
and we need to shine the light on that
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
and find out why this is
 
01:45:01.560 --> 01:45:03.109 align:start position:0%
and find out why this is
happening

01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
happening
 
01:45:06.790 --> 01:45:06.800 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Woodcock any
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
comment thank you chairman quelli um
 
01:45:13.589 --> 01:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
this particular Bill annihilates public
 
01:45:17.470 --> 01:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
education in its total and the failures
 
01:45:20.669 --> 01:45:20.679 align:start position:0%
that the representative brought forward
 
01:45:22.709 --> 01:45:22.719 align:start position:0%
in terms of predicating this on TES
 
01:45:22.719 --> 01:45:23.510 align:start position:0%
in terms of predicating this on TES
School

01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
School
 
01:45:25.229 --> 01:45:25.239 align:start position:0%
clearly it depends which test you happen
 
01:45:27.310 --> 01:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
to take but I think this totally
 
01:45:30.589 --> 01:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
diminishes opportunity for students and
 
01:45:33.109 --> 01:45:33.119 align:start position:0%
public education in New Hampshire by not
 
01:45:35.669 --> 01:45:35.679 align:start position:0%
having an adequate background at all
 
01:45:37.390 --> 01:45:37.400 align:start position:0%
this is not a minimum educ this is worse
 
01:45:40.030 --> 01:45:40.040 align:start position:0%
than minimum education this is almost no
 
01:45:43.750 --> 01:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
education and I highly support the itl
 
01:45:43.760 --> 01:45:44.990 align:start position:0%
education and I highly support the itl
thank

01:45:44.990 --> 01:45:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
you rep
 
01:45:50.189 --> 01:45:50.199 align:start position:0%
s thank you Mr chair um so I have two
 
01:45:52.750 --> 01:45:52.760 align:start position:0%
separate points the first is yesterday
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
um this bill was discussed at the
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
Holocaust and genocide education
 
01:46:01.030 --> 01:46:01.040 align:start position:0%
Commission meeting um at at and they
 
01:46:03.790 --> 01:46:03.800 align:start position:0%
asked me to express that um as a
 
01:46:05.470 --> 01:46:05.480 align:start position:0%
commission and I abstained from the vote
 
01:46:07.229 --> 01:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
just to make sure that I was keeping my
 
01:46:09.430 --> 01:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
roles separate in that regard just to be
 
01:46:11.990 --> 01:46:12.000 align:start position:0%
clear but uh aside from my vote it was
 
01:46:13.990 --> 01:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
unanimous to oppose this bill because of
 
01:46:16.669 --> 01:46:16.679 align:start position:0%
the removal of genocide education which
 
01:46:18.669 --> 01:46:18.679 align:start position:0%
is part of a previous mandate that that
 
01:46:21.629 --> 01:46:21.639 align:start position:0%
is included in our students curriculum
 
01:46:23.950 --> 01:46:23.960 align:start position:0%
on a separate note from that I want to
 
01:46:26.510 --> 01:46:26.520 align:start position:0%
make sure we're recognizing the 30,000
 
01:46:28.510 --> 01:46:28.520 align:start position:0%
people who signed in in opposition to
 
01:46:31.629 --> 01:46:31.639 align:start position:0%
this bill um sure we can all spend seven
 
01:46:33.390 --> 01:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
or eight weeks reading through every
 
01:46:36.990 --> 01:46:37.000 align:start position:0%
single one of the testimonies um as well
 
01:46:40.030 --> 01:46:40.040 align:start position:0%
as all of the people who came to testify
 
01:46:42.270 --> 01:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
in person um as well as the
 
01:46:44.669 --> 01:46:44.679 align:start position:0%
superintendent of the school district
 
01:46:48.189 --> 01:46:48.199 align:start position:0%
who um was it was implied that he had
 
01:46:50.750 --> 01:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
requested this bill and he came and very
 
01:46:52.070 --> 01:46:52.080 align:start position:0%
specifically said to us that that had
 
01:46:54.070 --> 01:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
not been what he had requested he was
 
01:46:55.750 --> 01:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
requesting additional funding I think if
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
we want to recognize how best to support
 
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
our students we need to be looking to
 
01:47:01.790 --> 01:47:01.800 align:start position:0%
the committee that is currently meeting
 
01:47:03.750 --> 01:47:03.760 align:start position:0%
down the hall and at the ways in which
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
we fund and balance education across the
 
01:47:08.229 --> 01:47:08.239 align:start position:0%
state for equity and parity for all of
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
our students but this bill I believe
 
01:47:12.990 --> 01:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
should be uh not not just ital if it
 
01:47:14.310 --> 01:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
were up to me I would indefinitely
 
01:47:17.470 --> 01:47:17.480 align:start position:0%
postpone it and remove it
 
01:47:20.470 --> 01:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
forever representive Hall thank you Mr
 
01:47:22.470 --> 01:47:22.480 align:start position:0%
chair um I'd like to respond to The
 
01:47:25.830 --> 01:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
Shining Shining Light on our failures um
 
01:47:28.229 --> 01:47:28.239 align:start position:0%
when we look at and we hear that a lot
 
01:47:31.430 --> 01:47:31.440 align:start position:0%
um when we look at test scores which you
 
01:47:33.430 --> 01:47:33.440 align:start position:0%
like to look at the N scores we're in
 
01:47:36.310 --> 01:47:36.320 align:start position:0%
the top I saw three I've heard five so
 
01:47:39.030 --> 01:47:39.040 align:start position:0%
let's say top five in the country so I
 
01:47:41.709 --> 01:47:41.719 align:start position:0%
think we should stop shedding so much
 
01:47:44.430 --> 01:47:44.440 align:start position:0%
light on these failures and and focus on
 
01:47:46.109 --> 01:47:46.119 align:start position:0%
successes thank
 
01:47:50.589 --> 01:47:50.599 align:start position:0%
you I'll just uh comment that uh I
 
01:47:54.109 --> 01:47:54.119 align:start position:0%
understand the intent of the the prime
 
01:47:57.629 --> 01:47:57.639 align:start position:0%
sponsor um I do think we need to focus
 
01:47:59.229 --> 01:47:59.239 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:47:59.239 --> 01:48:01.550 align:start position:0%
on the
basics

01:48:01.550 --> 01:48:01.560 align:start position:0%
basics
 
01:48:05.350 --> 01:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
um the prime sponsor indicated that the
 
01:48:10.950 --> 01:48:10.960 align:start position:0%
intent was to do that and then have
 
01:48:10.960 --> 01:48:12.430 align:start position:0%
intent was to do that and then have
local

01:48:12.430 --> 01:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
local
 
01:48:15.070 --> 01:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
districts provide all the additional
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
instruction that they saw appropriate um
 
01:48:23.510 --> 01:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
and needed in their District as um we
 
01:48:25.510 --> 01:48:25.520 align:start position:0%
always hear about local
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
control um but um that often uh um uh
 
01:48:34.950 --> 01:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
waffles in the wind sometimes local
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
control um so I understand the uh the
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
intent um but I do not think that this
 
01:48:45.990 --> 01:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
was the um the right vehicle or timing
 
01:48:50.229 --> 01:48:50.239 align:start position:0%
um for this legislation so um I will uh
 
01:48:54.310 --> 01:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
be voting also for the itl motion
 
01:48:56.589 --> 01:48:56.599 align:start position:0%
is there any further
 
01:48:59.550 --> 01:48:59.560 align:start position:0%
discussion representative litfield thank
 
01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:03.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman so I agree that this
 
01:49:06.270 --> 01:49:06.280 align:start position:0%
bill should be it uh I agree that it's
 
01:49:08.990 --> 01:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
not appropriate that being said though I
 
01:49:11.470 --> 01:49:11.480 align:start position:0%
do want to say I understand on some
 
01:49:13.790 --> 01:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
level even though maybe he didn't do it
 
01:49:15.030 --> 01:49:15.040 align:start position:0%
in the best way I understand where the
 
01:49:17.229 --> 01:49:17.239 align:start position:0%
sponsor is coming from because yes we
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
are in the top five in the country or
 
01:49:21.270 --> 01:49:21.280 align:start position:0%
even our local districts we could say oh
 
01:49:23.550 --> 01:49:23.560 align:start position:0%
we're top 10 in the state or whatever
 
01:49:25.830 --> 01:49:25.840 align:start position:0%
what concerns me is when we look at
 
01:49:27.629 --> 01:49:27.639 align:start position:0%
those we're not saying oh we're this out
 
01:49:29.750 --> 01:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
of 100% it's we're looking at it like
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
let's say oh the average across the
 
01:49:34.149 --> 01:49:34.159 align:start position:0%
country is 50% I don't know what it is
 
01:49:38.310 --> 01:49:38.320 align:start position:0%
but 50% proficient or 52% proficient so
 
01:49:39.629 --> 01:49:39.639 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm saying if we if we
 
01:49:41.430 --> 01:49:41.440 align:start position:0%
come in with those scores then oh we're
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
number one or we're number two that's
 
01:49:45.229 --> 01:49:45.239 align:start position:0%
still not good enough for our kids like
 
01:49:48.229 --> 01:49:48.239 align:start position:0%
I feel like we have to do better but I I
 
01:49:49.669 --> 01:49:49.679 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree that we need to keep
 
01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
the Arts in there because that's the
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
further comment representative Woodcock
 
01:49:58.070 --> 01:49:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and I just want to close after
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
after my second that additionally every
 
01:50:03.390 --> 01:50:03.400 align:start position:0%
youngster that come to public education
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
needs something to stimulate them if we
 
01:50:09.390 --> 01:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
take out art music if we take out World
 
01:50:11.310 --> 01:50:11.320 align:start position:0%
languages we take out Civics anything
 
01:50:13.229 --> 01:50:13.239 align:start position:0%
that's going interest what we need is to
 
01:50:15.229 --> 01:50:15.239 align:start position:0%
be sure that that youngster comes back
 
01:50:16.750 --> 01:50:16.760 align:start position:0%
to school the next day motivated to
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
learn something and if we run these
 
01:50:20.510 --> 01:50:20.520 align:start position:0%
people against the wall with three
 
01:50:23.070 --> 01:50:23.080 align:start position:0%
subjects we are totally diminishing what
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
adequate totally educated youngsters in
 
01:50:26.750 --> 01:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they need the opportunity
 
01:50:29.669 --> 01:50:29.679 align:start position:0%
to explore thank you represent
 
01:50:32.270 --> 01:50:32.280 align:start position:0%
Morris I just want to make a comment I'm
 
01:50:33.950 --> 01:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
pretty sure most of everyone in this
 
01:50:37.270 --> 01:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
room knows that my district sits at 14%
 
01:50:40.350 --> 01:50:40.360 align:start position:0%
proficiencies 14 I mean that's that's
 
01:50:43.390 --> 01:50:43.400 align:start position:0%
really really really low um so I know
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
that for my district we need to focus
 
01:50:46.589 --> 01:50:46.599 align:start position:0%
definitely more on the curriculum and
 
01:50:49.270 --> 01:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
the core subjects before adding on
 
01:50:52.069 --> 01:50:52.079 align:start position:0%
additionals um though I I do agree with
 
01:50:54.550 --> 01:50:54.560 align:start position:0%
needing arts and physical education and
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
social study Civics and all those things
 
01:50:58.750 --> 01:50:58.760 align:start position:0%
including photography like half the kids
 
01:51:00.990 --> 01:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
that become photographers wouldn't be
 
01:51:02.589 --> 01:51:02.599 align:start position:0%
photographers without Photography in
 
01:51:04.910 --> 01:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
high school um and I I agree with local
 
01:51:06.910 --> 01:51:06.920 align:start position:0%
control giving this back to the district
 
01:51:10.350 --> 01:51:10.360 align:start position:0%
so they can offer these as electives um
 
01:51:11.870 --> 01:51:11.880 align:start position:0%
but I trust in the school districts to
 
01:51:13.270 --> 01:51:13.280 align:start position:0%
do what's right when they have the tools
 
01:51:15.229 --> 01:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
that are given to
 
01:51:20.109 --> 01:51:20.119 align:start position:0%
them thank you uh R NATO thank you Mr
 
01:51:21.990 --> 01:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
chair uh I just want to address thank
 
01:51:23.990 --> 01:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
you for saying that we need to make it

yeah um it wasn't wasn't scheduled but
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
we took it up and so I infer from that
 
01:55:50.709 --> 01:55:50.719 align:start position:0%
he not only wants to the committee to
 
01:55:53.350 --> 01:55:53.360 align:start position:0%
take care of the disposition of the bill
 
01:55:57.830 --> 01:55:57.840 align:start position:0%
but he wants he wants to get it to and
 
01:55:59.709 --> 01:55:59.719 align:start position:0%
get it defeated as quickly as possible
 
01:56:02.470 --> 01:56:02.480 align:start position:0%
so we can put as much distance distance
 
01:56:02.480 --> 01:56:21.229 align:start position:0%
so we can put as much distance distance
from

01:56:21.229 --> 01:56:21.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.239 --> 01:56:51.229 align:start position:0%

the beautiful Lakes
 
03:29:46.590 --> 03:29:46.600 align:start position:0%
Region and U this
 
03:29:51.070 --> 03:29:51.080 align:start position:0%
bill um really came um from a
 
03:29:54.189 --> 03:29:54.199 align:start position:0%
discussion uh last year I believe it was
 
03:29:56.790 --> 03:29:56.800 align:start position:0%
or it might even been during the EFA
 
03:29:59.429 --> 03:29:59.439 align:start position:0%
oversight committee uh
 
03:30:03.189 --> 03:30:03.199 align:start position:0%
meetings and that pertains to the um
 
03:30:07.750 --> 03:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
current uh provider advisory
 
03:30:11.830 --> 03:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
commission um in current statute it
 
03:30:16.510 --> 03:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
basically is um an optional meeting to
 
03:30:20.349 --> 03:30:20.359 align:start position:0%
be called by the uh executive director
 
03:30:22.550 --> 03:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
of children's scholarship
 
03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
fund um who uh
 
03:30:28.229 --> 03:30:28.239 align:start position:0%
until uh the discussion that we had on
 
03:30:31.790 --> 03:30:31.800 align:start position:0%
this subject had not called a meeting um
 
03:30:34.150 --> 03:30:34.160 align:start position:0%
and I believe has called a meeting since
 
03:30:40.070 --> 03:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
then so I felt it appropriate to um uh
 
03:30:42.269 --> 03:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
to do a little work on the advisory
 
03:30:45.469 --> 03:30:45.479 align:start position:0%
commission and make it uh a mandatory
 
03:30:45.479 --> 03:30:47.349 align:start position:0%
commission and make it uh a mandatory
meeting

03:30:47.349 --> 03:30:47.359 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
03:30:52.349 --> 03:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
um and you'll see that um on page one in
 
03:30:55.950 --> 03:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
the top half uh I revised the commission
 
03:30:57.830 --> 03:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
to uh nine
 
03:31:01.110 --> 03:31:01.120 align:start position:0%
members rather than the current seven
 
03:31:03.269 --> 03:31:03.279 align:start position:0%
and indicated that five members would be
 
03:31:05.269 --> 03:31:05.279 align:start position:0%
a quorum of the
 
03:31:08.830 --> 03:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
committee um in addition um I believe
 
03:31:12.710 --> 03:31:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's already the case where the um uh
 
03:31:15.389 --> 03:31:15.399 align:start position:0%
the director of the scholarship fund um
 
03:31:18.070 --> 03:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
is a n non non voting
 
03:31:20.510 --> 03:31:20.520 align:start position:0%
chairperson um and also the commissioner
 
03:31:24.030 --> 03:31:24.040 align:start position:0%
is a non- voting member of the
 
03:31:27.510 --> 03:31:27.520 align:start position:0%
commission and uh I revised slightly the
 
03:31:31.110 --> 03:31:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh duties of the uh commission and
 
03:31:33.349 --> 03:31:33.359 align:start position:0%
indicated that it shall meet at least on
 
03:31:37.590 --> 03:31:37.600 align:start position:0%
a quarterly basis and more often as
 
03:31:41.710 --> 03:31:41.720 align:start position:0%
necessary um and slightly revised uh and
 
03:31:46.429 --> 03:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
you'll see in 15 through uh 19 line
 
03:31:50.990 --> 03:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
um the duties of the uh uh commission or
 
03:31:52.429 --> 03:31:52.439 align:start position:0%
the C yeah the
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
commission and that the commission
 
03:31:57.910 --> 03:31:57.920 align:start position:0%
should uh provide an annual report uh
 
03:32:01.110 --> 03:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
each November uh beginning next
 
03:32:05.510 --> 03:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
year uh so I think that that's um
 
03:32:08.910 --> 03:32:08.920 align:start position:0%
important uh to uh have that as a
 
03:32:11.030 --> 03:32:11.040 align:start position:0%
regular meeting and not leave it up to
 
03:32:13.590 --> 03:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
one person's discretion whether to have
 
03:32:16.630 --> 03:32:16.640 align:start position:0%
a meeting or not
 
03:32:18.189 --> 03:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
I then
 
03:32:21.349 --> 03:32:21.359 align:start position:0%
added uh two new
 
03:32:25.670 --> 03:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
sections um and these new sections are
 
03:32:29.269 --> 03:32:29.279 align:start position:0%
already in law for the tax credit
 
03:32:29.279 --> 03:32:30.630 align:start position:0%
already in law for the tax credit
scholarship

03:32:30.630 --> 03:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
scholarship
 
03:32:35.590 --> 03:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
program so I lifted the requirements
 
03:32:39.870 --> 03:32:39.880 align:start position:0%
from um that program and put them also
 
03:32:42.710 --> 03:32:42.720 align:start position:0%
in the EFA program thinking that they
 
03:32:46.189 --> 03:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
made sense um if they were in the tax
 
03:32:48.910 --> 03:32:48.920 align:start position:0%
credit scholarship program um that they
 
03:32:50.750 --> 03:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
should also be in the EFA program
 
03:32:52.710 --> 03:32:52.720 align:start position:0%
because I think it's useful information
 
03:32:56.389 --> 03:32:56.399 align:start position:0%
and um questions have been uh coming up
 
03:32:59.349 --> 03:32:59.359 align:start position:0%
on uh or in the uh EFA oversight
 
03:33:02.469 --> 03:33:02.479 align:start position:0%
committee on some of these
 
03:33:06.910 --> 03:33:06.920 align:start position:0%
topics and the first is an impact
 
03:33:11.590 --> 03:33:11.600 align:start position:0%
survey um that is given to parents who
 
03:33:15.110 --> 03:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
have a child leaving an EF leaving a a
 
03:33:17.550 --> 03:33:17.560 align:start position:0%
public school for an education Freedom
 
03:33:23.469 --> 03:33:23.479 align:start position:0%
account and um soliciting reasons for uh
 
03:33:25.910 --> 03:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
why they are leaving the public school
 
03:33:28.950 --> 03:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
for the EFA and any suggestions they
 
03:33:33.590 --> 03:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
have as to um why they left but what
 
03:33:38.269 --> 03:33:38.279 align:start position:0%
might have prevented them um from
 
03:33:41.710 --> 03:33:41.720 align:start position:0%
leaving the second one is a parental Sur
 
03:33:44.950 --> 03:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
a parental satisfaction survey and that
 
03:33:46.630 --> 03:33:46.640 align:start position:0%
is on P h
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
2 um beginning in lines
 
03:33:53.550 --> 03:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
three and it's again it's taken straight
 
03:33:57.030 --> 03:33:57.040 align:start position:0%
from the tax credit scholarship program
 
03:34:01.189 --> 03:34:01.199 align:start position:0%
and is uh to uh solicit uh information
 
03:34:03.870 --> 03:34:03.880 align:start position:0%
from parents about their
 
03:34:06.189 --> 03:34:06.199 align:start position:0%
satisfaction um with the
 
03:34:09.349 --> 03:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
program and they have the ability to
 
03:34:11.710 --> 03:34:11.720 align:start position:0%
strongly agree through strongly
 
03:34:15.189 --> 03:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
disagree um on the survey and it
 
03:34:15.199 --> 03:34:16.550 align:start position:0%
disagree um on the survey and it
prescribed

03:34:16.550 --> 03:34:16.560 align:start position:0%
prescribed
 
03:34:19.910 --> 03:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
three uh questions that uh are to be
 
03:34:21.990 --> 03:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
included uh in the
 
03:34:25.269 --> 03:34:25.279 align:start position:0%
survey and uh you'll see those on lines
 
03:34:29.670 --> 03:34:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:32.710 --> 03:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
14 and so
 
03:34:36.429 --> 03:34:36.439 align:start position:0%
that I felt that that information would
 
03:34:36.439 --> 03:34:37.510 align:start position:0%
that I felt that that information would
be

03:34:37.510 --> 03:34:37.520 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:34:42.269 --> 03:34:42.279 align:start position:0%
useful uh to all of us um and it's
 
03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
already in statute for the scholarship
 
03:34:46.150 --> 03:34:46.160 align:start position:0%
program which
 
03:34:49.309 --> 03:34:49.319 align:start position:0%
um if you're looking for it um it's
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
probably not in our books but it's RSA
 
03:34:59.590 --> 03:34:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:02.030 --> 03:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
G and so the last two sections are
 
03:35:04.429 --> 03:35:04.439 align:start position:0%
straight from from that
 
03:35:08.150 --> 03:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
program and I'd be glad to answer any
 
03:35:10.269 --> 03:35:10.279 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much any
 
03:35:13.429 --> 03:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
questions representative wock thank you
 
03:35:15.870 --> 03:35:15.880 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chairman
 
03:35:20.229 --> 03:35:20.239 align:start position:0%
Qui just a question um on on page two uh
 
03:35:23.830 --> 03:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
line five go uh wh why why administered
 
03:35:25.189 --> 03:35:25.199 align:start position:0%
by the scholarship
 
03:35:27.309 --> 03:35:27.319 align:start position:0%
organization it seems to be a the
 
03:35:28.790 --> 03:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
commission is running if I write if I
 
03:35:31.030 --> 03:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
read your P right oversight commission
 
03:35:32.630 --> 03:35:32.640 align:start position:0%
this commission is going to be getting
 
03:35:34.550 --> 03:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
the they they um the commission is
 
03:35:37.189 --> 03:35:37.199 align:start position:0%
really focused more on education uh the
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
service providers okay rather than
 
03:35:42.309 --> 03:35:42.319 align:start position:0%
necessarily um parental satisfaction or
 
03:35:45.070 --> 03:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
anything like that but why have a
 
03:35:46.349 --> 03:35:46.359 align:start position:0%
separate enti
 
03:35:47.910 --> 03:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
of the scholarship organization running
 
03:35:49.910 --> 03:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
the survey why would it be
 
03:35:53.389 --> 03:35:53.399 align:start position:0%
doe well children's scholarship fund is
 
03:35:56.269 --> 03:35:56.279 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the program uh just
 
03:35:57.630 --> 03:35:57.640 align:start position:0%
as they are with the tax credit
 
03:36:00.030 --> 03:36:00.040 align:start position:0%
scholarship program in both cases it's
 
03:36:02.110 --> 03:36:02.120 align:start position:0%
the administrator of the program who's
 
03:36:03.150 --> 03:36:03.160 align:start position:0%
doing the
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
survey so I wonder not that may have a
 
03:36:09.150 --> 03:36:09.160 align:start position:0%
change perhaps but I wonder if you're
 
03:36:10.750 --> 03:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
going to do it using that why wouldn't
 
03:36:12.349 --> 03:36:12.359 align:start position:0%
you just say the the administration of
 
03:36:14.189 --> 03:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
the program I'm thinking something
 
03:36:17.710 --> 03:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
changes along I I I'm I'm
 
03:36:20.070 --> 03:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
not yeah I got it scholarship
 
03:36:22.870 --> 03:36:22.880 align:start position:0%
organization is meant to be a generic
 
03:36:26.110 --> 03:36:26.120 align:start position:0%
term okay okay that makes sense all
 
03:36:27.710 --> 03:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
03:36:29.870 --> 03:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
you represent of
 
03:36:34.950 --> 03:36:34.960 align:start position:0%
celik thank you um on page one in um
 
03:36:36.469 --> 03:36:36.479 align:start position:0%
where it talks about in section two
 
03:36:37.950 --> 03:36:37.960 align:start position:0%
where it talks about how they are
 
03:36:39.309 --> 03:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
appointed it says the members shall be
 
03:36:41.150 --> 03:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
appointed by the director of the
 
03:36:42.910 --> 03:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization and serve at
 
03:36:45.389 --> 03:36:45.399 align:start position:0%
the director's pleasure blah blah blah
 
03:36:47.630 --> 03:36:47.640 align:start position:0%
um um I'm
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
curious if the goal of this as I
 
03:36:54.670 --> 03:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
understand it is to be an advisory
 
03:36:56.990 --> 03:36:57.000 align:start position:0%
commission looking at this the survey
 
03:36:59.469 --> 03:36:59.479 align:start position:0%
why it would all be members appointed by
 
03:37:02.870 --> 03:37:02.880 align:start position:0%
the head of this program um if they're
 
03:37:05.269 --> 03:37:05.279 align:start position:0%
serving it at that person's pleasure
 
03:37:07.150 --> 03:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't they potentially be more likely
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
to only appoint people they believe are
 
03:37:12.349 --> 03:37:12.359 align:start position:0%
feeling satisfaction and omit sort of
 
03:37:13.710 --> 03:37:13.720 align:start position:0%
the broader perhaps there are a number
 
03:37:15.110 --> 03:37:15.120 align:start position:0%
of people who are part of the program in
 
03:37:17.349 --> 03:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
oneac capacity or another who are in
 
03:37:20.189 --> 03:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
fact dissatisfied with it but wouldn't
 
03:37:22.429 --> 03:37:22.439 align:start position:0%
be appointed because they were at odds
 
03:37:24.110 --> 03:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
with the director of that program I just
 
03:37:26.070 --> 03:37:26.080 align:start position:0%
it feels sort of like having the you
 
03:37:28.830 --> 03:37:28.840 align:start position:0%
know the the fox
 
03:37:30.870 --> 03:37:30.880 align:start position:0%
choosing so I'm just I'm trying to
 
03:37:32.830 --> 03:37:32.840 align:start position:0%
understand what the motivation is right
 
03:37:35.990 --> 03:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
this is for um this advisory uh
 
03:37:38.670 --> 03:37:38.680 align:start position:0%
commission is really um to look at the
 
03:37:41.030 --> 03:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
uh education service provider
 
03:37:45.269 --> 03:37:45.279 align:start position:0%
population um and um as you see in a um
 
03:37:48.269 --> 03:37:48.279 align:start position:0%
if there uh uh are
 
03:37:51.030 --> 03:37:51.040 align:start position:0%
appeals um of an education service
 
03:37:55.070 --> 03:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
provider um perhaps they have been um uh
 
03:37:58.030 --> 03:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
excluded from the program for an a
 
03:38:01.150 --> 03:38:01.160 align:start position:0%
reason they can appeal to this advisory
 
03:38:05.429 --> 03:38:05.439 align:start position:0%
commission um but then in B also to uh
 
03:38:07.870 --> 03:38:07.880 align:start position:0%
this group is to uh provide
 
03:38:10.870 --> 03:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
recommendations for um
 
03:38:16.389 --> 03:38:16.399 align:start position:0%
improvements um and also um uh look at
 
03:38:20.790 --> 03:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
um the account expenses sometimes um if
 
03:38:24.429 --> 03:38:24.439 align:start position:0%
payments are um slow to the getting to
 
03:38:26.990 --> 03:38:27.000 align:start position:0%
the education service providers um that
 
03:38:30.229 --> 03:38:30.239 align:start position:0%
would be feedback to this commission um
 
03:38:33.309 --> 03:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
to look at uh you know ways to speed up
 
03:38:35.910 --> 03:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
reimbursement and things like that right
 
03:38:37.429 --> 03:38:37.439 align:start position:0%
but my question is more about why would
 
03:38:40.710 --> 03:38:40.720 align:start position:0%
you have the person in charge of the
 
03:38:42.349 --> 03:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
program be the person appointing the
 
03:38:43.910 --> 03:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
council that's supposed to be judging
 
03:38:43.920 --> 03:38:45.750 align:start position:0%
council that's supposed to be judging
them

03:38:45.750 --> 03:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:38:49.349 --> 03:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
um they know um who the um the people
 
03:38:53.030 --> 03:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
involved are um and that um that is
 
03:38:55.510 --> 03:38:55.520 align:start position:0%
current law I have not changed that
 
03:38:57.429 --> 03:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
aspect of
 
03:39:01.189 --> 03:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
it representative Corell thank you madam
 
03:39:03.309 --> 03:39:03.319 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
03:39:06.790 --> 03:39:06.800 align:start position:0%
um I I'm I I think I see it but could
 
03:39:08.950 --> 03:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
you just like maybe give an example of
 
03:39:11.150 --> 03:39:11.160 align:start position:0%
so that we can differentiate between the
 
03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization and educate
 
03:39:17.030 --> 03:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
service providers cu I think there it's
 
03:39:20.229 --> 03:39:20.239 align:start position:0%
two separate entities and it's the one
 
03:39:23.550 --> 03:39:23.560 align:start position:0%
is doing the other right yes um thank
 
03:39:27.469 --> 03:39:27.479 align:start position:0%
you um yeah the scholarship organization
 
03:39:29.870 --> 03:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
children's scholarship fund is the name
 
03:39:32.790 --> 03:39:32.800 align:start position:0%
of the organization that um has been
 
03:39:35.910 --> 03:39:35.920 align:start position:0%
hired um to administer the program and
 
03:39:41.229 --> 03:39:41.239 align:start position:0%
is referred to in um 194f as the
 
03:39:41.239 --> 03:39:43.349 align:start position:0%
is referred to in um 194f as the
scholarship

scholarship
 
03:39:46.309 --> 03:39:46.319 align:start position:0%
organization um
 
03:39:46.319 --> 03:39:48.070 align:start position:0%
organization um
the

03:39:48.070 --> 03:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:39:50.590 --> 03:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:39:53.950 --> 03:39:53.960 align:start position:0%
um if the second part of your question
 
03:39:57.070 --> 03:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry what would be an example of
 
03:40:00.189 --> 03:40:00.199 align:start position:0%
service provider yeah um it would be um
 
03:40:04.030 --> 03:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
anyone from um a private school who uh
 
03:40:06.670 --> 03:40:06.680 align:start position:0%
had uh EFA students um attending the
 
03:40:11.349 --> 03:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
school to a tutor uh to um a local
 
03:40:13.870 --> 03:40:13.880 align:start position:0%
bookstore anyone who's providing
 
03:40:15.870 --> 03:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
services to
 
03:40:17.349 --> 03:40:17.359 align:start position:0%
um EFA
 
03:40:19.910 --> 03:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
students thank
 
03:40:24.110 --> 03:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
you representative Hall Madam chair and
 
03:40:26.389 --> 03:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question in this
 
03:40:28.309 --> 03:40:28.319 align:start position:0%
survey would there be questions about
 
03:40:30.630 --> 03:40:30.640 align:start position:0%
those that have afas and go back to
 
03:40:32.309 --> 03:40:32.319 align:start position:0%
Public Schools do we want that
 
03:40:34.429 --> 03:40:34.439 align:start position:0%
information or is it included in here at
 
03:40:40.189 --> 03:40:40.199 align:start position:0%
all um uh it is not but um it it could
 
03:40:43.750 --> 03:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
be um we do know that
 
03:40:46.910 --> 03:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
um um that a small percentage and I
 
03:40:49.630 --> 03:40:49.640 align:start position:0%
can't remember the percentage of EFA
 
03:40:52.429 --> 03:40:52.439 align:start position:0%
students um have uh gone back to their
 
03:40:55.630 --> 03:40:55.640 align:start position:0%
Public Schools um in some cases it's
 
03:40:57.590 --> 03:40:57.600 align:start position:0%
they wanted to do high school back in
 
03:41:01.750 --> 03:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
the public school um but um uh it does
 
03:41:05.710 --> 03:41:05.720 align:start position:0%
not specifically um ask for uh
 
03:41:08.990 --> 03:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
information from the parents as to um a
 
03:41:10.870 --> 03:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
return to the public school and the
 
03:41:13.150 --> 03:41:13.160 align:start position:0%
reason is not one of the mandated
 
03:41:16.870 --> 03:41:16.880 align:start position:0%
questions as I really just lifted that
 
03:41:19.750 --> 03:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
section from the um uh tax gr
 
03:41:21.670 --> 03:41:21.680 align:start position:0%
scholarship program um and those
 
03:41:24.429 --> 03:41:24.439 align:start position:0%
questions were um I think uh developed
 
03:41:26.910 --> 03:41:26.920 align:start position:0%
by uh Department of Revenue
 
03:41:29.510 --> 03:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
Administration when the program was put
 
03:41:32.309 --> 03:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
together follow up is that our fault the
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
second question sure wait okay thank you
 
03:41:37.229 --> 03:41:37.239 align:start position:0%
um could they do these surveys without
 
03:41:40.870 --> 03:41:40.880 align:start position:0%
it being in the you know a law can they
 
03:41:42.910 --> 03:41:42.920 align:start position:0%
could they just conduct surveys they
 
03:41:46.309 --> 03:41:46.319 align:start position:0%
could yes yep um
 
03:41:48.710 --> 03:41:48.720 align:start position:0%
yeah and I I had had some discussions
 
03:41:52.550 --> 03:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
with them um about doing those surveys
 
03:41:57.429 --> 03:41:57.439 align:start position:0%
um but um felt uh at this point um you
 
03:41:59.630 --> 03:41:59.640 align:start position:0%
know um with questions about
 
03:42:01.750 --> 03:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
accountability and so forth um it was
 
03:42:04.550 --> 03:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
worthwhile to put it into the statute
 
03:42:06.670 --> 03:42:06.680 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:42:10.630 --> 03:42:10.640 align:start position:0%
you representative cordelli for taking
 
03:42:12.790 --> 03:42:12.800 align:start position:0%
my question so um one of the biggest
 
03:42:14.790 --> 03:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
issues that we've heard on um this
 
03:42:17.429 --> 03:42:17.439 align:start position:0%
committee is privacy is there anything
 
03:42:20.590 --> 03:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
in these surveys that would um uh
 
03:42:23.830 --> 03:42:23.840 align:start position:0%
compromise the privacy of an individual
 
03:42:26.429 --> 03:42:26.439 align:start position:0%
student um I don't believe so the
 
03:42:28.910 --> 03:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
surveys are filled out by the
 
03:42:34.710 --> 03:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
parents um they're not um to be made um
 
03:42:38.070 --> 03:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
public uh information um I'm sure
 
03:42:40.429 --> 03:42:40.439 align:start position:0%
aggregate information um could be
 
03:42:45.269 --> 03:42:45.279 align:start position:0%
provided but um not individual responses
 
03:42:47.990 --> 03:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
thank you followup followup thank you
 
03:42:50.710 --> 03:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
and um just out of curiosity will this
 
03:42:53.309 --> 03:42:53.319 align:start position:0%
uh will this information um that the
 
03:42:55.870 --> 03:42:55.880 align:start position:0%
surveys um a mass will that be provided
 
03:42:58.269 --> 03:42:58.279 align:start position:0%
to the district that the child is
 
03:42:58.279 --> 03:42:59.910 align:start position:0%
to the district that the child is
leaving

03:42:59.910 --> 03:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
leaving
 
03:43:04.950 --> 03:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
um that's not um mandated in the U
 
03:43:08.790 --> 03:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
current um bill but um yeah there are
 
03:43:10.870 --> 03:43:10.880 align:start position:0%
many things that can be done true thank
 
03:43:14.269 --> 03:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
you represent Murray thank you madam
 
03:43:15.830 --> 03:43:15.840 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question I
 
03:43:17.229 --> 03:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure I was understanding
 
03:43:18.790 --> 03:43:18.800 align:start position:0%
when you said service
 
03:43:21.590 --> 03:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
organization are we talking about the
 
03:43:23.990 --> 03:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
same entity that I believe the
 
03:43:25.870 --> 03:43:25.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education had said in
 
03:43:28.070 --> 03:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
other circumstances wasn't required to
 
03:43:30.269 --> 03:43:30.279 align:start position:0%
send all of their data back to the state
 
03:43:32.070 --> 03:43:32.080 align:start position:0%
of New
 
03:43:32.080 --> 03:43:34.349 align:start position:0%
of New
Hampshire

03:43:34.349 --> 03:43:34.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:43:38.670 --> 03:43:38.680 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure what you're referring to
 
03:43:42.910 --> 03:43:42.920 align:start position:0%
um uh it could have been um in relation
 
03:43:45.710 --> 03:43:45.720 align:start position:0%
to uh an audit that was going to take
 
03:43:47.110 --> 03:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
that is taking
 
03:43:50.429 --> 03:43:50.439 align:start position:0%
place um and that there was some um
 
03:43:53.070 --> 03:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
request for information that really the
 
03:43:55.149 --> 03:43:55.159 align:start position:0%
department did not have and was not
 
03:43:58.710 --> 03:43:58.720 align:start position:0%
responsible for I think was um uh part
 
03:44:02.510 --> 03:44:02.520 align:start position:0%
of the discussion follow up if I uh
 
03:44:04.830 --> 03:44:04.840 align:start position:0%
thank you so I guess my question is does
 
03:44:06.910 --> 03:44:06.920 align:start position:0%
this bill require the service
 
03:44:08.469 --> 03:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
organization or service provider
 
03:44:11.429 --> 03:44:11.439 align:start position:0%
organization to send this information or
 
03:44:15.710 --> 03:44:15.720 align:start position:0%
the results back to the department uh
 
03:44:19.550 --> 03:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
uh the the um the commission has to do
 
03:44:20.670 --> 03:44:20.680 align:start position:0%
an annual
 
03:44:24.309 --> 03:44:24.319 align:start position:0%
report um which goes it's on um lines 20
 
03:44:28.469 --> 03:44:28.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:30.590 --> 03:44:30.600 align:start position:0%
page thank
 
03:44:33.550 --> 03:44:33.560 align:start position:0%
you representative Cornell Thank you
 
03:44:36.070 --> 03:44:36.080 align:start position:0%
madam speaker one more question it a
 
03:44:37.630 --> 03:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
it's given to the parents of students
 
03:44:39.910 --> 03:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
who have exited a public school Under
 
03:44:41.550 --> 03:44:41.560 align:start position:0%
the provisions of the chapter so they
 
03:44:46.950 --> 03:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:49.189 --> 03:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
already there and and receiving in right
 
03:44:52.349 --> 03:44:52.359 align:start position:0%
it was I I believe the intent was to U
 
03:44:55.590 --> 03:44:55.600 align:start position:0%
find out why children are leaving U
 
03:44:58.469 --> 03:44:58.479 align:start position:0%
Public Schools um and I I think in the
 
03:45:01.269 --> 03:45:01.279 align:start position:0%
future that uh uh might be useful
 
03:45:04.309 --> 03:45:04.319 align:start position:0%
information to the public school and um
 
03:45:07.670 --> 03:45:07.680 align:start position:0%
possibly should be uh provided um on an
 
03:45:11.830 --> 03:45:11.840 align:start position:0%
aggregate basis to um Public
 
03:45:15.110 --> 03:45:15.120 align:start position:0%
Schools representative Bon thank thank
 
03:45:16.469 --> 03:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
you madam chair and thank you
 
03:45:17.910 --> 03:45:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative Celli for taking my
 
03:45:21.630 --> 03:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
question on lines uh the on page two
 
03:45:24.870 --> 03:45:24.880 align:start position:0%
lines for all the way through the end
 
03:45:27.269 --> 03:45:27.279 align:start position:0%
you're talking about the survey um these
 
03:45:31.229 --> 03:45:31.239 align:start position:0%
questions are phrased in such a way that
 
03:45:34.269 --> 03:45:34.279 align:start position:0%
that is very um leans one way or the
 
03:45:37.030 --> 03:45:37.040 align:start position:0%
other obviously in a positive way um so
 
03:45:38.469 --> 03:45:38.479 align:start position:0%
it's kind of they're leading questions
 
03:45:40.910 --> 03:45:40.920 align:start position:0%
number one there subjective questions
 
03:45:43.910 --> 03:45:43.920 align:start position:0%
obviously you're asking parents
 
03:45:46.070 --> 03:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
to determine whether they've seen
 
03:45:50.510 --> 03:45:50.520 align:start position:0%
measurable Improvement um and I'm not
 
03:45:52.870 --> 03:45:52.880 align:start position:0%
sure what you're trying to get at when
 
03:45:54.790 --> 03:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
you say my child would have been unable
 
03:45:56.309 --> 03:45:56.319 align:start position:0%
to attend the school of his or her
 
03:45:58.269 --> 03:45:58.279 align:start position:0%
choice without the educational Freedom
 
03:46:01.389 --> 03:46:01.399 align:start position:0%
program unless that follows up with your
 
03:46:03.550 --> 03:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
the last question which it says
 
03:46:05.469 --> 03:46:05.479 align:start position:0%
excluding the education Freedom account
 
03:46:07.229 --> 03:46:07.239 align:start position:0%
how much did you pay out of pocket for
 
03:46:09.590 --> 03:46:09.600 align:start position:0%
your child to attend school this year
 
03:46:12.750 --> 03:46:12.760 align:start position:0%
again I are you going to really be able
 
03:46:15.550 --> 03:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
to get accurate information I mean it's
 
03:46:16.870 --> 03:46:16.880 align:start position:0%
it's very
 
03:46:16.880 --> 03:46:19.149 align:start position:0%
it's very
subjective

03:46:19.149 --> 03:46:19.159 align:start position:0%
subjective
 
03:46:22.590 --> 03:46:22.600 align:start position:0%
um I I would hope we could get accurate
 
03:46:26.030 --> 03:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
information but um you know with surveys
 
03:46:28.349 --> 03:46:28.359 align:start position:0%
um that's always a question um as we've
 
03:46:31.790 --> 03:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
discussed about uh that in in other
 
03:46:34.710 --> 03:46:34.720 align:start position:0%
circumstances um but uh again these were
 
03:46:37.750 --> 03:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
the questions um that I believe were
 
03:46:39.910 --> 03:46:39.920 align:start position:0%
made up by Dr with the scholarship
 
03:46:43.389 --> 03:46:43.399 align:start position:0%
program and I just took the same ones
 
03:46:47.870 --> 03:46:47.880 align:start position:0%
um uh and think in terms of um
 
03:46:47.880 --> 03:46:49.269 align:start position:0%
um uh and think in terms of um
measurable

03:46:49.269 --> 03:46:49.279 align:start position:0%
measurable
 
03:46:52.309 --> 03:46:52.319 align:start position:0%
Improvement um you know one of my points
 
03:46:56.910 --> 03:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
is that um uh this program has a great
 
03:47:00.189 --> 03:47:00.199 align:start position:0%
accountability measure in in parents and
 
03:47:03.349 --> 03:47:03.359 align:start position:0%
this is really to survey parents uh to
 
03:47:08.149 --> 03:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
see are you in fact seeing
 
03:47:10.229 --> 03:47:10.239 align:start position:0%
Improvement representative
 
03:47:12.229 --> 03:47:12.239 align:start position:0%
cik thank you very much and thank you
 
03:47:13.790 --> 03:47:13.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question and also my
 
03:47:15.349 --> 03:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
previous one because I realized I forgot
 
03:47:17.189 --> 03:47:17.199 align:start position:0%
that those statements previously this is
 
03:47:18.670 --> 03:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
really a followup on representative
 
03:47:22.070 --> 03:47:22.080 align:start position:0%
Cornell's question about the um students
 
03:47:22.910 --> 03:47:22.920 align:start position:0%
who've left I think it was
 
03:47:24.030 --> 03:47:24.040 align:start position:0%
representative Cornell about students
 
03:47:25.830 --> 03:47:25.840 align:start position:0%
who've left the public school we know
 
03:47:27.670 --> 03:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
there are a number of people who never
 
03:47:29.510 --> 03:47:29.520 align:start position:0%
had any intention of attending public
 
03:47:33.070 --> 03:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
schools at all who went into the EFA
 
03:47:36.269 --> 03:47:36.279 align:start position:0%
program prior to any element of school
 
03:47:39.630 --> 03:47:39.640 align:start position:0%
so they wouldn't have left a school um
 
03:47:41.910 --> 03:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
would it not make sense to have a
 
03:47:46.110 --> 03:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
question that asked in a a different way
 
03:47:47.550 --> 03:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
what their MO whether they had an
 
03:47:49.229 --> 03:47:49.239 align:start position:0%
intention of attending public school at
 
03:47:52.189 --> 03:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
all because if they didn't then we're
 
03:47:54.950 --> 03:47:54.960 align:start position:0%
directing I'm I'm trying to understand
 
03:47:57.590 --> 03:47:57.600 align:start position:0%
how we capture that very sizable portion
 
03:47:59.870 --> 03:47:59.880 align:start position:0%
of the EFA population that had never an
 
03:48:02.750 --> 03:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
intention to attend public school um
 
03:48:05.309 --> 03:48:05.319 align:start position:0%
yeah that that might be a valid question
 
03:48:10.790 --> 03:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:15.550 --> 03:48:15.560 align:start position:0%
add representative cck thank you thank
 
03:48:18.630 --> 03:48:18.640 align:start position:0%
you on on the I'm going back to the the
 
03:48:21.910 --> 03:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
membership of the committee the the
 
03:48:26.110 --> 03:48:26.120 align:start position:0%
appointed by the the uh director schol
 
03:48:28.830 --> 03:48:28.840 align:start position:0%
organization I think if if my internet
 
03:48:31.950 --> 03:48:31.960 align:start position:0%
is correct here I was us the phone I the
 
03:48:34.670 --> 03:48:34.680 align:start position:0%
internet that there's 10 counties in New
 
03:48:37.910 --> 03:48:37.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I think that's accurate um at
 
03:48:40.630 --> 03:48:40.640 align:start position:0%
least based on two minutes ago is there
 
03:48:42.830 --> 03:48:42.840 align:start position:0%
any chance we could have one person from
 
03:48:45.309 --> 03:48:45.319 align:start position:0%
each County delegation
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
I just and and I think some refer it to
 
03:48:49.590 --> 03:48:49.600 align:start position:0%
the the the hen and the hen house or
 
03:48:51.030 --> 03:48:51.040 align:start position:0%
chicken house or scoop or something one
 
03:48:52.510 --> 03:48:52.520 align:start position:0%
of those old phrases I'm not young
 
03:48:54.110 --> 03:48:54.120 align:start position:0%
enough to remember that stuff but in
 
03:48:58.229 --> 03:48:58.239 align:start position:0%
either case the U it would seem to me
 
03:49:00.910 --> 03:49:00.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm just concerned when as someone
 
03:49:02.950 --> 03:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
has mentioned if you have the person who
 
03:49:05.149 --> 03:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
is appoint if I was appointing a
 
03:49:07.950 --> 03:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
committee to do a somewhat biased
 
03:49:10.790 --> 03:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
response survey um and give it back to
 
03:49:14.229 --> 03:49:14.239 align:start position:0%
me I surely would want to put people who
 
03:49:16.750 --> 03:49:16.760 align:start position:0%
I think are going to be Pro my
 
03:49:18.269 --> 03:49:18.279 align:start position:0%
organization or my committee or what it
 
03:49:20.189 --> 03:49:20.199 align:start position:0%
happens to be so I think if the
 
03:49:22.269 --> 03:49:22.279 align:start position:0%
delegation if each delegation had one
 
03:49:23.389 --> 03:49:23.399 align:start position:0%
representative appointed by the
 
03:49:25.429 --> 03:49:25.439 align:start position:0%
delegation they still have almost the
 
03:49:28.070 --> 03:49:28.080 align:start position:0%
same number of folks um and then just
 
03:49:30.429 --> 03:49:30.439 align:start position:0%
was right that's all just a different
 
03:49:31.630 --> 03:49:31.640 align:start position:0%
way I just I just have concern I'm
 
03:49:33.269 --> 03:49:33.279 align:start position:0%
concerned about the who direct i' rather
 
03:49:37.389 --> 03:49:37.399 align:start position:0%
have the commissioner anybody else
 
03:49:39.229 --> 03:49:39.239 align:start position:0%
director yeah I'm not sure if the
 
03:49:42.710 --> 03:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner or the designate might know
 
03:49:45.429 --> 03:49:45.439 align:start position:0%
you know who the f right
 
03:49:48.189 --> 03:49:48.199 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm not sure who else could do
 
03:49:51.630 --> 03:49:51.640 align:start position:0%
it um but these are the members are
 
03:49:51.640 --> 03:49:52.830 align:start position:0%
it um but these are the members are
either

03:49:52.830 --> 03:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
either
 
03:49:57.309 --> 03:49:57.319 align:start position:0%
EFA um parents or service providers um I
 
03:49:59.950 --> 03:49:59.960 align:start position:0%
think it' be best to have a good mix
 
03:50:02.990 --> 03:50:03.000 align:start position:0%
because again they're they're not doing
 
03:50:06.070 --> 03:50:06.080 align:start position:0%
the surveying um this commission is
 
03:50:09.149 --> 03:50:09.159 align:start position:0%
actually just doing um the duties in A
 
03:50:12.750 --> 03:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
and B on 5 through 19 15 through 19 I'm
 
03:50:14.030 --> 03:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
sorry I missed that you're absolutely
 
03:50:17.349 --> 03:50:17.359 align:start position:0%
correct I think wrong I was think it was
 
03:50:20.750 --> 03:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
the General committee right hand out of
 
03:50:24.110 --> 03:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
those thank you no no problem representa
 
03:50:27.389 --> 03:50:27.399 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you madam chair in that
 
03:50:29.309 --> 03:50:29.319 align:start position:0%
cohort of individuals that is charged
 
03:50:32.149 --> 03:50:32.159 align:start position:0%
with uh the review process of the
 
03:50:36.550 --> 03:50:36.560 align:start position:0%
results um is there a public school
 
03:50:39.189 --> 03:50:39.199 align:start position:0%
representative Public School
 
03:50:42.229 --> 03:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
representative reviewing the responses
 
03:50:44.790 --> 03:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
reviewing the responses yes cuz it says
 
03:50:47.830 --> 03:50:47.840 align:start position:0%
that the the group the commission shall
 
03:50:50.750 --> 03:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
meet in person but from what I was
 
03:50:52.710 --> 03:50:52.720 align:start position:0%
hearing initially it was a cohort of
 
03:50:56.110 --> 03:50:56.120 align:start position:0%
individuals who seem to have similar
 
03:50:58.670 --> 03:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
perspectives well yeah the commission
 
03:51:01.670 --> 03:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
again is is just is parents and service
 
03:51:04.269 --> 03:51:04.279 align:start position:0%
providers because they're not doing uh
 
03:51:07.990 --> 03:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
the surveys which are outlined um
 
03:51:11.349 --> 03:51:11.359 align:start position:0%
starting in section three on line 24 um
 
03:51:13.790 --> 03:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
this the uh commission is totally
 
03:51:15.229 --> 03:51:15.239 align:start position:0%
separate from
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:28.790 --> 03:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
below any other
 
03:51:33.389 --> 03:51:33.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:43.349 --> 03:51:43.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:45.750 --> 03:51:45.760 align:start position:0%
Hawkins uh thank you madam chair for the
 
03:51:47.590 --> 03:51:47.600 align:start position:0%
recor Brian Hawkins representing na New
 
03:51:50.110 --> 03:51:50.120 align:start position:0%
Hampshire today I think I was at most of
 
03:51:53.870 --> 03:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
the uh uh education Freedom account uh
 
03:51:55.429 --> 03:51:55.439 align:start position:0%
legislative oversight committee meetings
 
03:51:57.550 --> 03:51:57.560 align:start position:0%
over the last few years and I just think
 
03:52:00.349 --> 03:52:00.359 align:start position:0%
some context U is important because I
 
03:52:03.070 --> 03:52:03.080 align:start position:0%
think there's uh I think this bill is a
 
03:52:05.469 --> 03:52:05.479 align:start position:0%
missed opportunity uh to actually bring
 
03:52:05.479 --> 03:52:06.389 align:start position:0%
missed opportunity uh to actually bring
some

03:52:06.389 --> 03:52:06.399 align:start position:0%
some
 
03:52:06.399 --> 03:52:07.910 align:start position:0%
some
additional

03:52:07.910 --> 03:52:07.920 align:start position:0%
additional
 
03:52:11.710 --> 03:52:11.720 align:start position:0%
um uh accountability to the program um
 
03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
so first um
 
03:52:17.229 --> 03:52:17.239 align:start position:0%
you know I I think that it would be
 
03:52:19.790 --> 03:52:19.800 align:start position:0%
valuable to have um the survey that was
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned earlier about people who are
 
03:52:25.590 --> 03:52:25.600 align:start position:0%
coming back um well back in 2022 there
 
03:52:29.630 --> 03:52:29.640 align:start position:0%
was a bill filed um a bipartisan Bill
 
03:52:34.269 --> 03:52:34.279 align:start position:0%
filed uh in the house to do uh a survey
 
03:52:37.349 --> 03:52:37.359 align:start position:0%
of uh students who had left their uh
 
03:52:39.910 --> 03:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
public school and from what I recall the
 
03:52:42.070 --> 03:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
testimony from some including the
 
03:52:44.269 --> 03:52:44.279 align:start position:0%
scholarship organization was to oppose
 
03:52:46.630 --> 03:52:46.640 align:start position:0%
that so uh I would urge you to look at
 
03:52:49.269 --> 03:52:49.279 align:start position:0%
that 2022 bill I will look up the number
 
03:52:51.910 --> 03:52:51.920 align:start position:0%
I apologize uh and partly why I handed
 
03:52:53.590 --> 03:52:53.600 align:start position:0%
my card in a little late was I think it
 
03:52:55.389 --> 03:52:55.399 align:start position:0%
was important that this has been looked
 
03:52:59.550 --> 03:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
at before um uh the year following the
 
03:53:01.269 --> 03:53:01.279 align:start position:0%
passage of the program because I think
 
03:53:03.149 --> 03:53:03.159 align:start position:0%
it it did have some um important
 
03:53:04.870 --> 03:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
information there the second thing I I
 
03:53:07.469 --> 03:53:07.479 align:start position:0%
just want to say is um I think it's
 
03:53:09.550 --> 03:53:09.560 align:start position:0%
important to put uh some more um
 
03:53:12.670 --> 03:53:12.680 align:start position:0%
actionable teeth into the bill about uh
 
03:53:15.349 --> 03:53:15.359 align:start position:0%
these uh meetings in the information
 
03:53:16.990 --> 03:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
because part of the reason I think we're
 
03:53:19.710 --> 03:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
here and the the legislative oversight
 
03:53:19.720 --> 03:53:21.950 align:start position:0%
here and the the legislative oversight
committee

03:53:21.950 --> 03:53:21.960 align:start position:0%
committee
 
03:53:24.990 --> 03:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
uh that the legislative oversight
 
03:53:28.870 --> 03:53:28.880 align:start position:0%
committee uh I think it was last summer
 
03:53:31.510 --> 03:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
um discovered was the parent advisory
 
03:53:33.269 --> 03:53:33.279 align:start position:0%
committee wasn't meeting you know this
 
03:53:35.590 --> 03:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
is years into the program and they had
 
03:53:39.070 --> 03:53:39.080 align:start position:0%
not yet met uh and the justification for
 
03:53:42.790 --> 03:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
that was anecdotally we know that
 
03:53:45.189 --> 03:53:45.199 align:start position:0%
parents are satisfied with the program
 
03:53:48.870 --> 03:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
and um I is a little astounding but I
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
think um you know that was an obligation
 
03:53:55.229 --> 03:53:55.239 align:start position:0%
to convene under the law and it wasn't
 
03:54:00.070 --> 03:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
done and so um so that that is another
 
03:54:01.750 --> 03:54:01.760 align:start position:0%
um issue so I urge you to look at that
 
03:54:03.710 --> 03:54:03.720 align:start position:0%
as you're contemplating the language
 
03:54:05.790 --> 03:54:05.800 align:start position:0%
around this bill um the other thing I'd
 
03:54:10.429 --> 03:54:10.439 align:start position:0%
just say about the um M opportunity is I
 
03:54:13.590 --> 03:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
don't think that uh the whether it's the
 
03:54:13.600 --> 03:54:14.910 align:start position:0%
don't think that uh the whether it's the
survey

03:54:14.910 --> 03:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
survey
 
03:54:18.830 --> 03:54:18.840 align:start position:0%
or um the amendments to the current
 
03:54:21.510 --> 03:54:21.520 align:start position:0%
statute for the parent advisory uh
 
03:54:24.750 --> 03:54:24.760 align:start position:0%
commission uh replaces the fact that um
 
03:54:27.550 --> 03:54:27.560 align:start position:0%
we don't have much achievement data or
 
03:54:29.790 --> 03:54:29.800 align:start position:0%
any achievement data from this program
 
03:54:32.670 --> 03:54:32.680 align:start position:0%
and that um
 
03:54:37.110 --> 03:54:37.120 align:start position:0%
the uh it it's ENT you know essentially
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh left out in terms of
 
03:54:41.870 --> 03:54:41.880 align:start position:0%
requirements uh from from the current
 
03:54:44.469 --> 03:54:44.479 align:start position:0%
law and so we don't know how students
 
03:54:48.550 --> 03:54:48.560 align:start position:0%
are doing um academically in this in
 
03:54:50.510 --> 03:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
this program whether it's improving
 
03:54:52.990 --> 03:54:53.000 align:start position:0%
whether it's not if the previous States
 
03:54:55.590 --> 03:54:55.600 align:start position:0%
who had passed a similar program to ours
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
is any indication who did have some kind
 
03:54:59.710 --> 03:54:59.720 align:start position:0%
of some kind of assessment work that's
 
03:55:02.110 --> 03:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
required and published uh on an
 
03:55:04.550 --> 03:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
aggregate basis I would be if I were the
 
03:55:06.750 --> 03:55:06.760 align:start position:0%
legislature I'd be very troubled by that
 
03:55:09.990 --> 03:55:10.000 align:start position:0%
because uh a lot of that data is is not
 
03:55:14.830 --> 03:55:14.840 align:start position:0%
good um some of it is um very
 
03:55:17.389 --> 03:55:17.399 align:start position:0%
much of it is um very concerning in
 
03:55:22.429 --> 03:55:22.439 align:start position:0%
terms of uh students who switched to uh
 
03:55:25.830 --> 03:55:25.840 align:start position:0%
a bachelor program and the results uh in
 
03:55:27.630 --> 03:55:27.640 align:start position:0%
some of the states uh that we've talked
 
03:55:29.830 --> 03:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
about here in this committee before when
 
03:55:31.070 --> 03:55:31.080 align:start position:0%
we're talking about expanding the
 
03:55:35.590 --> 03:55:35.600 align:start position:0%
program um that those uh those results
 
03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
um were were uh as I said very
 
03:55:41.189 --> 03:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
concerning so I'll close my uh testimony
 
03:55:44.429 --> 03:55:44.439 align:start position:0%
there and happy to take any questions
 
03:55:46.469 --> 03:55:46.479 align:start position:0%
can or come back with any ones that I
 
03:55:48.110 --> 03:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
don't don't have the information before
 
03:55:49.510 --> 03:55:49.520 align:start position:0%
me representative
 
03:55:51.510 --> 03:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair and thank
 
03:55:54.149 --> 03:55:54.159 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so um I I
 
03:55:55.469 --> 03:55:55.479 align:start position:0%
understand your concerns about the
 
03:55:57.309 --> 03:55:57.319 align:start position:0%
committee not meeting but would you not
 
03:55:59.389 --> 03:55:59.399 align:start position:0%
agree that this bill would force that
 
03:56:02.149 --> 03:56:02.159 align:start position:0%
committee to convene and finally give us
 
03:56:04.830 --> 03:56:04.840 align:start position:0%
the information that we
 
03:56:07.469 --> 03:56:07.479 align:start position:0%
need I don't think we should have had to
 
03:56:09.670 --> 03:56:09.680 align:start position:0%
have passed another bill to ask them to
 
03:56:09.680 --> 03:56:11.229 align:start position:0%
have passed another bill to ask them to
meet

03:56:11.229 --> 03:56:11.239 align:start position:0%
meet
 
03:56:14.030 --> 03:56:14.040 align:start position:0%
um uh I I think I think by the end of
 
03:56:16.229 --> 03:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
the uh to be fair I think by the end of
 
03:56:18.790 --> 03:56:18.800 align:start position:0%
the oversight committee meeting there
 
03:56:20.710 --> 03:56:20.720 align:start position:0%
the meetings had begun I don't know if
 
03:56:22.710 --> 03:56:22.720 align:start position:0%
there's been anything published from
 
03:56:25.950 --> 03:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
those um but I think more
 
03:56:29.830 --> 03:56:29.840 align:start position:0%
importantly that this seems to be um one
 
03:56:32.149 --> 03:56:32.159 align:start position:0%
of the one of the only Central uh
 
03:56:34.830 --> 03:56:34.840 align:start position:0%
markers for this program in terms of how
 
03:56:37.189 --> 03:56:37.199 align:start position:0%
students are doing and I I just as I
 
03:56:38.630 --> 03:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
said I think it's a missed opportunity
 
03:56:40.429 --> 03:56:40.439 align:start position:0%
to just make some tweet make some tweaks
 
03:56:42.870 --> 03:56:42.880 align:start position:0%
to The Advisory commission having to do
 
03:56:44.870 --> 03:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
with provider approval
 
03:56:48.389 --> 03:56:48.399 align:start position:0%
um and not and not go further in terms
 
03:56:51.269 --> 03:56:51.279 align:start position:0%
of uh looking at achievement and also
 
03:56:54.349 --> 03:56:54.359 align:start position:0%
looking at the actual process that is
 
03:56:56.830 --> 03:56:56.840 align:start position:0%
undergone when um the scholarship
 
03:56:59.790 --> 03:56:59.800 align:start position:0%
organization is approving a
 
03:57:02.630 --> 03:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
provider representative celik thank you
 
03:57:05.309 --> 03:57:05.319 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question um
 
03:57:06.910 --> 03:57:06.920 align:start position:0%
I just want to clarify when you talk
 
03:57:10.229 --> 03:57:10.239 align:start position:0%
about um specific achievement data um
 
03:57:11.910 --> 03:57:11.920 align:start position:0%
using this as another opport an
 
03:57:14.189 --> 03:57:14.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to create access to specific
 
03:57:16.750 --> 03:57:16.760 align:start position:0%
achievement data from the EFA program
 
03:57:18.349 --> 03:57:18.359 align:start position:0%
would that be like the current
 
03:57:20.189 --> 03:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
standardized test that we administer
 
03:57:22.670 --> 03:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
within our public schools at certain
 
03:57:25.030 --> 03:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
benchmark grades I think it's uh if I'm
 
03:57:28.189 --> 03:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
remembering correctly it's 2 3rd fifth
 
03:57:30.870 --> 03:57:30.880 align:start position:0%
8th and 11th grades that our students
 
03:57:33.229 --> 03:57:33.239 align:start position:0%
take a variety of standardized tests is
 
03:57:34.389 --> 03:57:34.399 align:start position:0%
is that the kind of thing you're talking
 
03:57:35.630 --> 03:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
about or something else I just want to
 
03:57:37.670 --> 03:57:37.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that I where where we could
 
03:57:40.950 --> 03:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
get some Benchmark data yeah wellc
 
03:57:42.830 --> 03:57:42.840 align:start position:0%
because there's not one option that's
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
required um I would imagine it's hard to
 
03:57:48.870 --> 03:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
get any kind of aggregate data uh so you
 
03:57:51.670 --> 03:57:51.680 align:start position:0%
know I think that is testing the one and
 
03:57:52.950 --> 03:57:52.960 align:start position:0%
only thing that is going to tell you
 
03:57:54.670 --> 03:57:54.680 align:start position:0%
where our student is I'm sure all the
 
03:57:57.349 --> 03:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
Educators many of the Educators and on
 
03:57:58.830 --> 03:57:58.840 align:start position:0%
this committee former Educators would
 
03:58:00.670 --> 03:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
agree that that is not the only thing
 
03:58:03.910 --> 03:58:03.920 align:start position:0%
but I think when we're talking about um
 
03:58:06.110 --> 03:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
having some kind of understanding about
 
03:58:07.790 --> 03:58:07.800 align:start position:0%
where the program is I mean Tennessee
 
03:58:09.990 --> 03:58:10.000 align:start position:0%
just recently did a pilot program we
 
03:58:11.830 --> 03:58:11.840 align:start position:0%
were talking about proficiency earlier
 
03:58:15.510 --> 03:58:15.520 align:start position:0%
in in an earlier committee and and um
 
03:58:17.910 --> 03:58:17.920 align:start position:0%
they did a pilot program in one of the
 
03:58:20.110 --> 03:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
school districts in Tennessee with a
 
03:58:23.910 --> 03:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
program and what they saw was uh uh a a
 
03:58:26.429 --> 03:58:26.439 align:start position:0%
significant lag behind local public
 
03:58:29.990 --> 03:58:30.000 align:start position:0%
schools on on um proficiency score so I
 
03:58:32.149 --> 03:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
think not knowing and having any kind of
 
03:58:37.070 --> 03:58:37.080 align:start position:0%
marker is worse than is is is
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
problematic uh especially because you
 
03:58:41.229 --> 03:58:41.239 align:start position:0%
are investing an increasing amount of
 
03:58:44.229 --> 03:58:44.239 align:start position:0%
money into this program uh I know that
 
03:58:46.750 --> 03:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
Department gave the both these
 
03:58:49.510 --> 03:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
committees the policy and administration
 
03:58:50.630 --> 03:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
excuse me policy and administration
 
03:58:52.510 --> 03:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
committee and the funding committee some
 
03:58:54.469 --> 03:58:54.479 align:start position:0%
data on the program that it was going to
 
03:58:57.389 --> 03:58:57.399 align:start position:0%
grow from 30 to 38 million I think by
 
03:59:02.030 --> 03:59:02.040 align:start position:0%
the end of FY 26 and so this even if
 
03:59:04.550 --> 03:59:04.560 align:start position:0%
there's no expansion done this year the
 
03:59:07.070 --> 03:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
program is going to grow at in terms of
 
03:59:11.189 --> 03:59:11.199 align:start position:0%
the as far as the forecast uh and so I
 
03:59:14.269 --> 03:59:14.279 align:start position:0%
think this is a good time to for the
 
03:59:18.550 --> 03:59:18.560 align:start position:0%
legislature to to really take a look at
 
03:59:22.910 --> 03:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
what kind of um assess accountability uh
 
03:59:26.830 --> 03:59:26.840 align:start position:0%
that is a part of this program so any
 
03:59:26.840 --> 03:59:27.790 align:start position:0%
that is a part of this program so any
other

03:59:27.790 --> 03:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
other
 
03:59:30.070 --> 03:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Brian
 
03:59:30.080 --> 03:59:31.189 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you Brian
appreciate

03:59:31.189 --> 03:59:31.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
03:59:34.510 --> 03:59:34.520 align:start position:0%
it would anyone else like to testify on
 
03:59:36.510 --> 03:59:36.520 align:start position:0%
this okay we're going to close the
 
03:59:40.550 --> 03:59:40.560 align:start position:0%

04:15:28.429 --> 04:15:28.439 align:start position:0%
okay we'll uh get started with our next
 
04:15:31.630 --> 04:15:31.640 align:start position:0%
bill which is House Bill
 
04:15:33.870 --> 04:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
740 requiring the Department of
 
04:15:36.429 --> 04:15:36.439 align:start position:0%
Education to maintain student records of
 
04:15:40.070 --> 04:15:40.080 align:start position:0%
Chartered public school students and uh
 
04:15:42.309 --> 04:15:42.319 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor representative fellows
 
04:15:44.229 --> 04:15:44.239 align:start position:0%
is here
 
04:15:47.349 --> 04:15:47.359 align:start position:0%
welcome to the education policy
 
04:15:50.070 --> 04:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chair committee
 
04:15:52.950 --> 04:15:52.960 align:start position:0%
members I came from just down the hall
 
04:15:56.189 --> 04:15:56.199 align:start position:0%
the from the education funding committee
 
04:16:00.830 --> 04:16:00.840 align:start position:0%
um so the purpose of the why I filed
 
04:16:03.149 --> 04:16:03.159 align:start position:0%
this bill is because a couple of years
 
04:16:05.910 --> 04:16:05.920 align:start position:0%
ago a charter school closed it was the
 
04:16:09.710 --> 04:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
one that was here in conquered and um
 
04:16:11.830 --> 04:16:11.840 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of confusion about how
 
04:16:14.349 --> 04:16:14.359 align:start position:0%
to handle different aspects of their
 
04:16:16.750 --> 04:16:16.760 align:start position:0%
closure and one of them was what to do
 
04:16:18.109 --> 04:16:18.119 align:start position:0%
with the Student
 
04:16:21.750 --> 04:16:21.760 align:start position:0%
Records so you may especially anybody
 
04:16:24.149 --> 04:16:24.159 align:start position:0%
who's new um to this committee may not
 
04:16:26.990 --> 04:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
know but there's been a statute in place
 
04:16:30.109 --> 04:16:30.119 align:start position:0%
forever as far as I can tell that says
 
04:16:32.429 --> 04:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
school districts now we start start out
 
04:16:33.990 --> 04:16:34.000 align:start position:0%
with school districts because this
 
04:16:36.030 --> 04:16:36.040 align:start position:0%
statute was in place more than a hundred
 
04:16:37.870 --> 04:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
years ago and that's all we were dealing
 
04:16:39.269 --> 04:16:39.279 align:start position:0%
with at that
 
04:16:42.469 --> 04:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
time that school districts needed to
 
04:16:47.349 --> 04:16:47.359 align:start position:0%
Main Ain permanent records about their
 
04:16:52.349 --> 04:16:52.359 align:start position:0%
students and those records consisted of
 
04:16:55.510 --> 04:16:55.520 align:start position:0%
um enrollment for every single day of
 
04:16:57.510 --> 04:16:57.520 align:start position:0%
the year you know was the student there
 
04:17:00.469 --> 04:17:00.479 align:start position:0%
or not there why they came into the
 
04:17:03.590 --> 04:17:03.600 align:start position:0%
school did they did they um just enter
 
04:17:05.550 --> 04:17:05.560 align:start position:0%
at kindergarten did they transfer from
 
04:17:08.590 --> 04:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
another place and it had um other
 
04:17:12.349 --> 04:17:12.359 align:start position:0%
information in those records and uh
 
04:17:13.950 --> 04:17:13.960 align:start position:0%
later on
 
04:17:16.830 --> 04:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
when most most people were graduating
 
04:17:20.309 --> 04:17:20.319 align:start position:0%
from high school those the transcripts
 
04:17:23.630 --> 04:17:23.640 align:start position:0%
of um the students courses and whether
 
04:17:26.030 --> 04:17:26.040 align:start position:0%
or not they graduated from high school
 
04:17:28.990 --> 04:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
were also part of the permanent records
 
04:17:31.309 --> 04:17:31.319 align:start position:0%
in statute it's defined permanent
 
04:17:35.149 --> 04:17:35.159 align:start position:0%
records it refers to the enrollment um I
 
04:17:38.510 --> 04:17:38.520 align:start position:0%
didn't find anywhere where it mentioned
 
04:17:41.109 --> 04:17:41.119 align:start position:0%
the high school transcript but it does
 
04:17:45.229 --> 04:17:45.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:50.309 --> 04:17:50.319 align:start position:0%
so um school districts I I school
 
04:17:52.070 --> 04:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
districts as far as I know have never
 
04:17:54.309 --> 04:17:54.319 align:start position:0%
closed there have been school districts
 
04:17:55.630 --> 04:17:55.640 align:start position:0%
that have
 
04:17:57.950 --> 04:17:57.960 align:start position:0%
Consolidated U to make a Cooperative
 
04:18:00.309 --> 04:18:00.319 align:start position:0%
District but there's never been there
 
04:18:02.429 --> 04:18:02.439 align:start position:0%
there is no municipality that has
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
students that doesn't have a school
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
district so there's always been a place
 
04:18:07.830 --> 04:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
to keep those permanent
 
04:18:10.950 --> 04:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
records and but when we have now we have
 
04:18:13.389 --> 04:18:13.399 align:start position:0%
charter schools and if they're approved
 
04:18:15.109 --> 04:18:15.119 align:start position:0%
by the school district then there's no
 
04:18:16.910 --> 04:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
problem because the school district will
 
04:18:18.670 --> 04:18:18.680 align:start position:0%
just keep those records but most of our
 
04:18:21.229 --> 04:18:21.239 align:start position:0%
schools are approved by the state board
 
04:18:24.429 --> 04:18:24.439 align:start position:0%
so it's really important that we make
 
04:18:28.229 --> 04:18:28.239 align:start position:0%
sure that we maintain those records for
 
04:18:31.670 --> 04:18:31.680 align:start position:0%
those Charter Schools um should they
 
04:18:35.229 --> 04:18:35.239 align:start position:0%
close that um were approved by the state
 
04:18:37.590 --> 04:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
board so that's the intent of this
 
04:18:40.469 --> 04:18:40.479 align:start position:0%
record so a student who you know
 
04:18:43.950 --> 04:18:43.960 align:start position:0%
graduates from a charter school and
 
04:18:45.990 --> 04:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
couple years down the road the school
 
04:18:49.269 --> 04:18:49.279 align:start position:0%
closes and the person that student
 
04:18:51.309 --> 04:18:51.319 align:start position:0%
should be able to get a copy of their CL
 
04:18:53.750 --> 04:18:53.760 align:start position:0%
transcript to you know verify that they
 
04:18:55.990 --> 04:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
graduated from high school and it's
 
04:18:58.910 --> 04:18:58.920 align:start position:0%
probably even more important now because
 
04:19:00.990 --> 04:19:01.000 align:start position:0%
we have these dual
 
04:19:04.510 --> 04:19:04.520 align:start position:0%
enrollments um so kids can be in high
 
04:19:06.550 --> 04:19:06.560 align:start position:0%
school they can be certified with
 
04:19:10.389 --> 04:19:10.399 align:start position:0%
different um trade jobs so we need to
 
04:19:13.189 --> 04:19:13.199 align:start position:0%
have records of that information so
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
that's that's why um this bill is
 
04:19:22.790 --> 04:19:22.800 align:start position:0%
here uh I did a lot of research um oh to
 
04:19:26.189 --> 04:19:26.199 align:start position:0%
go let me give you some more history um
 
04:19:27.990 --> 04:19:28.000 align:start position:0%
I started working at the Department of
 
04:19:29.469 --> 04:19:29.479 align:start position:0%
Education in
 
04:19:33.109 --> 04:19:33.119 align:start position:0%
1985 and retired in
 
04:19:38.710 --> 04:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
2017 so when I first started um the
 
04:19:43.429 --> 04:19:43.439 align:start position:0%
statutes in the um statutes under the
 
04:19:45.830 --> 04:19:45.840 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the State Board of
 
04:19:49.990 --> 04:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
Education um then and still does require
 
04:19:52.510 --> 04:19:52.520 align:start position:0%
the State Board to give to school
 
04:19:56.309 --> 04:19:56.319 align:start position:0%
districts every single year a form to
 
04:19:59.790 --> 04:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
keep track of these permanent records
 
04:20:03.269 --> 04:20:03.279 align:start position:0%
and since I was started in 1985 I
 
04:20:05.950 --> 04:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
remember those records they were U
 
04:20:08.510 --> 04:20:08.520 align:start position:0%
printed on very nice archival kinds of
 
04:20:11.309 --> 04:20:11.319 align:start position:0%
paper so that they would last a long
 
04:20:13.710 --> 04:20:13.720 align:start position:0%
time and
 
04:20:18.189 --> 04:20:18.199 align:start position:0%
um because there was that form which I
 
04:20:20.830 --> 04:20:20.840 align:start position:0%
don't know for sure but I'm guessing the
 
04:20:23.910 --> 04:20:23.920 align:start position:0%
form was adopted by rules because I know
 
04:20:25.950 --> 04:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
that's the process now for
 
04:20:29.030 --> 04:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
forms um it was
 
04:20:32.830 --> 04:20:32.840 align:start position:0%
identified what had to be kept for for
 
04:20:37.910 --> 04:20:37.920 align:start position:0%
those records well when after about 10
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
10 or 12 years so we get into the 1990s
 
04:20:45.670 --> 04:20:45.680 align:start position:0%
school districts started to use
 
04:20:47.550 --> 04:20:47.560 align:start position:0%
computers to keep track of their
 
04:20:49.990 --> 04:20:50.000 align:start position:0%
students so there were amendments to
 
04:20:53.309 --> 04:20:53.319 align:start position:0%
statutes that said you know you can use
 
04:20:54.750 --> 04:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
you don't have to use that paper
 
04:20:57.469 --> 04:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
register the um State Department of
 
04:21:00.109 --> 04:21:00.119 align:start position:0%
Education gave you you could keep track
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
on computer but you had to make sure
 
04:21:05.710 --> 04:21:05.720 align:start position:0%
that you had at least one paper copy and
 
04:21:08.309 --> 04:21:08.319 align:start position:0%
there there was never any repeal of the
 
04:21:11.349 --> 04:21:11.359 align:start position:0%
requirement to keep the Student Records
 
04:21:15.630 --> 04:21:15.640 align:start position:0%
either and and so now we find oursel in
 
04:21:17.590 --> 04:21:17.600 align:start position:0%
a place
 
04:21:20.510 --> 04:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
where that is no longer in
 
04:21:25.149 --> 04:21:25.159 align:start position:0%
rules um there was some
 
04:21:27.790 --> 04:21:27.800 align:start position:0%
deletions I gave you you have a piece of
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
paper that has some of the changes that
 
04:21:29.520 --> 04:21:30.269 align:start position:0%
paper that has some of the changes that
were

04:21:30.269 --> 04:21:30.279 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:21:35.229 --> 04:21:35.239 align:start position:0%
made um historically to this some of the
 
04:21:35.239 --> 04:21:36.830 align:start position:0%
made um historically to this some of the
statutes

04:21:36.830 --> 04:21:36.840 align:start position:0%
statutes
 
04:21:39.469 --> 04:21:39.479 align:start position:0%
but you know not really requiring a
 
04:21:41.630 --> 04:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
print out but they're still required the
 
04:21:43.750 --> 04:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
school districts are still required to
 
04:21:45.790 --> 04:21:45.800 align:start position:0%
um keep those
 
04:21:49.630 --> 04:21:49.640 align:start position:0%
records and they have continued to do
 
04:21:51.790 --> 04:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
that because in the school districts
 
04:21:55.469 --> 04:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
they've got all they have the um
 
04:21:58.790 --> 04:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
historical memory the institutional
 
04:22:01.309 --> 04:22:01.319 align:start position:0%
memory that just kept them doing that
 
04:22:03.189 --> 04:22:03.199 align:start position:0%
and so they're you know they may be in
 
04:22:05.630 --> 04:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
they're not on paper anymore they maybe
 
04:22:07.870 --> 04:22:07.880 align:start position:0%
they're I don't know what they're on but
 
04:22:10.269 --> 04:22:10.279 align:start position:0%
they are keeping those records so we
 
04:22:13.469 --> 04:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
need to make sure that charter schools
 
04:22:15.550 --> 04:22:15.560 align:start position:0%
understand that they need to do the same
 
04:22:18.269 --> 04:22:18.279 align:start position:0%
thing they need to keep those permanent
 
04:22:21.710 --> 04:22:21.720 align:start position:0%
records and when a charter school
 
04:22:24.710 --> 04:22:24.720 align:start position:0%
closes my bill proposes to have the
 
04:22:27.510 --> 04:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education be responsible
 
04:22:30.750 --> 04:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
for those records and the reason that it
 
04:22:32.550 --> 04:22:32.560 align:start position:0%
makes sense to have the department of
 
04:22:35.830 --> 04:22:35.840 align:start position:0%
education do it is because there are
 
04:22:39.670 --> 04:22:39.680 align:start position:0%
also statutes about colleges and though
 
04:22:42.790 --> 04:22:42.800 align:start position:0%
public and private colleges if one goes
 
04:22:45.030 --> 04:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
out of business then the State
 
04:22:47.790 --> 04:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
Department of Education is responsible
 
04:22:50.309 --> 04:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
for keeping those kinds of Records so
 
04:22:52.870 --> 04:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
some somebody can verify that they did
 
04:22:54.429 --> 04:22:54.439 align:start position:0%
get a college
 
04:22:58.269 --> 04:22:58.279 align:start position:0%
degree so that's what this bill
 
04:22:58.279 --> 04:23:01.790 align:start position:0%
degree so that's what this bill
does

04:23:01.790 --> 04:23:01.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:15.910 --> 04:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
I know we don't usually do show and tell
 
04:23:18.790 --> 04:23:18.800 align:start position:0%
but this is what copy of what one of the
 
04:23:20.910 --> 04:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
registers looks like that was able to
 
04:23:22.790 --> 04:23:22.800 align:start position:0%
get one from the school district and
 
04:23:25.309 --> 04:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
it's a remarkably similar to what it's
 
04:23:28.469 --> 04:23:28.479 align:start position:0%
remarkably similar to what um the school
 
04:23:31.630 --> 04:23:31.640 align:start position:0%
districts keep now in terms of of
 
04:23:35.429 --> 04:23:35.439 align:start position:0%
information on a student there's um
 
04:23:37.429 --> 04:23:37.439 align:start position:0%
every time a student moves from one
 
04:23:41.030 --> 04:23:41.040 align:start position:0%
school to another there are records um
 
04:23:44.590 --> 04:23:44.600 align:start position:0%
made indicating uh did they go out of
 
04:23:47.229 --> 04:23:47.239 align:start position:0%
state did they transfer it to another
 
04:23:49.830 --> 04:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
District um there's code for if a
 
04:23:51.389 --> 04:23:51.399 align:start position:0%
student dies and that's why you take
 
04:23:52.550 --> 04:23:52.560 align:start position:0%
them off the
 
04:23:58.510 --> 04:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
register and um if they're expelled and
 
04:24:03.389 --> 04:24:03.399 align:start position:0%
if they graduate if they transfer um to
 
04:24:05.590 --> 04:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
the next grade if they're promoted or
 
04:24:08.349 --> 04:24:08.359 align:start position:0%
not so all this pretty much all the same
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
things that we keep now um work kept
 
04:24:18.830 --> 04:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
back then so I I did not put in the bill
 
04:24:21.389 --> 04:24:21.399 align:start position:0%
what the elements of the student record
 
04:24:25.830 --> 04:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
are because you could really think it's
 
04:24:28.349 --> 04:24:28.359 align:start position:0%
a Department's job to do that and put
 
04:24:30.750 --> 04:24:30.760 align:start position:0%
them in rules which is this would have
 
04:24:32.309 --> 04:24:32.319 align:start position:0%
been a
 
04:24:36.389 --> 04:24:36.399 align:start position:0%
rule but this just makes it clear that
 
04:24:39.229 --> 04:24:39.239 align:start position:0%
the Student Records won't get lost for a
 
04:24:41.590 --> 04:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
charter school that closes and these are
 
04:24:43.590 --> 04:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
only the only the chartered schools that
 
04:24:45.790 --> 04:24:45.800 align:start position:0%
are approved by the state
 
04:24:49.510 --> 04:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
board good thank you very much represent
 
04:24:51.710 --> 04:24:51.720 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:24:53.229 --> 04:24:53.239 align:start position:0%
representative for bringing this bill
 
04:24:55.630 --> 04:24:55.640 align:start position:0%
forward I do have one question so in
 
04:24:58.510 --> 04:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
regards to other types of data that a
 
04:25:00.109 --> 04:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
charter school may have in the event of
 
04:25:01.870 --> 04:25:01.880 align:start position:0%
its closure if it's coming from
 
04:25:04.149 --> 04:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
ascending District does that then also
 
04:25:05.830 --> 04:25:05.840 align:start position:0%
just reside at the department of Ed or
 
04:25:08.790 --> 04:25:08.800 align:start position:0%
does it get also sent back to the the
 
04:25:11.590 --> 04:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
sending school for services or related
 
04:25:11.600 --> 04:25:13.750 align:start position:0%
sending school for services or related
services

04:25:13.750 --> 04:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
services
 
04:25:13.760 --> 04:25:15.189 align:start position:0%
services
um

04:25:15.189 --> 04:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:17.910 --> 04:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
so so up until
 
04:25:21.349 --> 04:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:24.830 --> 04:25:24.840 align:start position:0%
2007 there was the information that came
 
04:25:27.910 --> 04:25:27.920 align:start position:0%
from school districts up to the state it
 
04:25:30.269 --> 04:25:30.279 align:start position:0%
never was about an individual student it
 
04:25:33.269 --> 04:25:33.279 align:start position:0%
was always how many you know how many
 
04:25:35.429 --> 04:25:35.439 align:start position:0%
students you had in each grade or
 
04:25:39.670 --> 04:25:39.680 align:start position:0%
whatever and but since then the records
 
04:25:41.550 --> 04:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
that they keep now at the Department of
 
04:25:45.710 --> 04:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
Education they don't have the detail of
 
04:25:49.349 --> 04:25:49.359 align:start position:0%
um an individual student what days they
 
04:25:51.229 --> 04:25:51.239 align:start position:0%
were present and what days they were
 
04:25:54.830 --> 04:25:54.840 align:start position:0%
absent that that is in here and that
 
04:26:00.030 --> 04:26:00.040 align:start position:0%
should be according to statute and and
 
04:26:02.429 --> 04:26:02.439 align:start position:0%
precedent they should have as part of
 
04:26:05.149 --> 04:26:05.159 align:start position:0%
their per permanent record they do have
 
04:26:07.750 --> 04:26:07.760 align:start position:0%
all the transfer anything that has to do
 
04:26:09.870 --> 04:26:09.880 align:start position:0%
with coming in or leaving the school
 
04:26:13.030 --> 04:26:13.040 align:start position:0%
district and school you know they keep
 
04:26:16.670 --> 04:26:16.680 align:start position:0%
track of what school and what district
 
04:26:21.070 --> 04:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:23.389 --> 04:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
whatever represent
 
04:26:25.710 --> 04:26:25.720 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair thank you
 
04:26:28.030 --> 04:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
representative for coming forward um
 
04:26:29.670 --> 04:26:29.680 align:start position:0%
with this bill I do have a question
 
04:26:31.590 --> 04:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
about school AG children so if a child
 
04:26:32.710 --> 04:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
of schools
 
04:26:35.349 --> 04:26:35.359 align:start position:0%
closes and that school age child
 
04:26:37.229 --> 04:26:37.239 align:start position:0%
transfers to a public school doesn't
 
04:26:38.950 --> 04:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
that record follow them to the public
 
04:26:38.960 --> 04:26:43.790 align:start position:0%
that record follow them to the public
school

04:26:43.790 --> 04:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:49.950 --> 04:26:49.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:54.710 --> 04:26:54.720 align:start position:0%
that I I don't think so I think
 
04:26:57.550 --> 04:26:57.560 align:start position:0%
well I think that probably the last
 
04:26:59.790 --> 04:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
school year school year if a if a
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
student was in one school for five years
 
04:27:06.269 --> 04:27:06.279 align:start position:0%
and then they they left that school to
 
04:27:08.790 --> 04:27:08.800 align:start position:0%
transfer to another one I think that
 
04:27:11.030 --> 04:27:11.040 align:start position:0%
probably the record for the last year
 
04:27:12.670 --> 04:27:12.680 align:start position:0%
would go with them because what they're
 
04:27:14.630 --> 04:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
mostly interested in is like what grade
 
04:27:16.750 --> 04:27:16.760 align:start position:0%
should we put this student in I don't
 
04:27:18.550 --> 04:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
think they'd have all of that
 
04:27:21.389 --> 04:27:21.399 align:start position:0%
information follow yes I'm just but I'm
 
04:27:23.309 --> 04:27:23.319 align:start position:0%
not I'm not 100% sure that's and I
 
04:27:25.830 --> 04:27:25.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate your honesty about that um so
 
04:27:28.670 --> 04:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
my followup to that would be if they're
 
04:27:33.109 --> 04:27:33.119 align:start position:0%
only looking for the last year then is
 
04:27:35.750 --> 04:27:35.760 align:start position:0%
that not the practice right now on our
 
04:27:37.750 --> 04:27:37.760 align:start position:0%
Public Schools or do they just keep all
 
04:27:41.309 --> 04:27:41.319 align:start position:0%
of the records in perpetuity for I mean
 
04:27:45.149 --> 04:27:45.159 align:start position:0%
oh so no so so in terms of the permanent
 
04:27:47.550 --> 04:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
record if a student was in one school
 
04:27:50.149 --> 04:27:50.159 align:start position:0%
one District let's say one district for
 
04:27:52.670 --> 04:27:52.680 align:start position:0%
five years and then they move to another
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
district for five years the the um the
 
04:28:00.590 --> 04:28:00.600 align:start position:0%
five years first five years worth of of
 
04:28:03.750 --> 04:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
information stays with that school
 
04:28:05.910 --> 04:28:05.920 align:start position:0%
district the records stay with the
 
04:28:08.790 --> 04:28:08.800 align:start position:0%
school district for
 
04:28:11.590 --> 04:28:11.600 align:start position:0%
follow so that doesn't all of that prior
 
04:28:13.950 --> 04:28:13.960 align:start position:0%
five years doesn't get reported to the
 
04:28:17.149 --> 04:28:17.159 align:start position:0%
doe it does get reported to the doe it
 
04:28:19.550 --> 04:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
was reported to the Doe by that first
 
04:28:21.790 --> 04:28:21.800 align:start position:0%
district that they were in then when the
 
04:28:25.469 --> 04:28:25.479 align:start position:0%
student transfers to another town then
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
they go to a different school and that
 
04:28:31.189 --> 04:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
new school district is reporting for
 
04:28:33.109 --> 04:28:33.119 align:start position:0%
every year thank you I'm understanding
 
04:28:34.590 --> 04:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
what you're saying representative
 
04:28:36.189 --> 04:28:36.199 align:start position:0%
fellows that at the point I was trying
 
04:28:38.229 --> 04:28:38.239 align:start position:0%
to make is if a child is leaving a CH
 
04:28:40.109 --> 04:28:40.119 align:start position:0%
school and going to a public school I
 
04:28:41.710 --> 04:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
would hope that all of the records are
 
04:28:43.469 --> 04:28:43.479 align:start position:0%
Fallen that child that was the point I
 
04:28:44.590 --> 04:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
was trying to make but thank you for
 
04:28:48.229 --> 04:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
your honesty on this so just one thing
 
04:28:51.149 --> 04:28:51.159 align:start position:0%
to make clear if don't this has nothing
 
04:28:53.910 --> 04:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
to do with special ed records that I
 
04:28:53.920 --> 04:28:54.670 align:start position:0%
to do with special ed records that I
wasn't

04:28:54.670 --> 04:28:54.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
04:28:57.229 --> 04:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
referral I'm just talking strictly a
 
04:29:00.550 --> 04:29:00.560 align:start position:0%
regular students right we we do have a
 
04:29:02.309 --> 04:29:02.319 align:start position:0%
uh two people from the Department here
 
04:29:04.910 --> 04:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
also that could answer questions
 
04:29:04.920 --> 04:29:05.910 align:start position:0%
also that could answer questions
represent

04:29:05.910 --> 04:29:05.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
04:29:08.189 --> 04:29:08.199 align:start position:0%
s thank you so much and thank you for
 
04:29:09.910 --> 04:29:09.920 align:start position:0%
taking my question and also Welcome to
 
04:29:11.149 --> 04:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
our visitors who are here from
 
04:29:12.750 --> 04:29:12.760 align:start position:0%
leadership conquer
 
04:29:14.189 --> 04:29:14.199 align:start position:0%
um we're glad they're able to join us
 
04:29:17.910 --> 04:29:17.920 align:start position:0%
today but um so I think about you talked
 
04:29:19.710 --> 04:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
about schools that close the charter
 
04:29:21.149 --> 04:29:21.159 align:start position:0%
schools that closed and completely went
 
04:29:22.389 --> 04:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
out of business so this would be a way
 
04:29:24.590 --> 04:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
to ensure that someone who graduated
 
04:29:28.189 --> 04:29:28.199 align:start position:0%
from a school if the school then shut
 
04:29:30.070 --> 04:29:30.080 align:start position:0%
down for whatever reason I think one of
 
04:29:31.910 --> 04:29:31.920 align:start position:0%
the CCO schools did that there's still a
 
04:29:33.750 --> 04:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
way for them to access their information
 
04:29:36.229 --> 04:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
through the state even where where like
 
04:29:37.429 --> 04:29:37.439 align:start position:0%
right now someone who graduated from
 
04:29:39.510 --> 04:29:39.520 align:start position:0%
Dober High School can reach back to
 
04:29:41.109 --> 04:29:41.119 align:start position:0%
Dober High School in 50 years and get
 
04:29:42.750 --> 04:29:42.760 align:start position:0%
their records this would be if they
 
04:29:44.550 --> 04:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
attended you know red bottle school that
 
04:29:46.550 --> 04:29:46.560 align:start position:0%
went out of business that in 50 years
 
04:29:47.590 --> 04:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
they could reach out to the state and
 
04:29:49.149 --> 04:29:49.159 align:start position:0%
say I went to red bottle school I need
 
04:29:51.710 --> 04:29:51.720 align:start position:0%
proof of that yeah that's that's exactly
 
04:29:54.990 --> 04:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
the purpose okay thank you so
 
04:29:58.030 --> 04:29:58.040 align:start position:0%
much represent B Money uh thank you Mr
 
04:29:59.149 --> 04:29:59.159 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
04:30:00.710 --> 04:30:00.720 align:start position:0%
question um my question is just
 
04:30:03.030 --> 04:30:03.040 align:start position:0%
regarding to uh record retentions in
 
04:30:06.710 --> 04:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
general um I assume that in uh the r
 
04:30:08.349 --> 04:30:08.359 align:start position:0%
says right now that charter schools are
 
04:30:10.510 --> 04:30:10.520 align:start position:0%
required to keep these permanent
 
04:30:12.910 --> 04:30:12.920 align:start position:0%
records um
 
04:30:14.750 --> 04:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
someone at the Department of Education
 
04:30:17.109 --> 04:30:17.119 align:start position:0%
told me that was not true Okay the
 
04:30:18.550 --> 04:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
reason I asked that is I know we've been
 
04:30:20.710 --> 04:30:20.720 align:start position:0%
told that unless it's specifically says
 
04:30:23.510 --> 04:30:23.520 align:start position:0%
a charter school needs to do that it so
 
04:30:26.109 --> 04:30:26.119 align:start position:0%
this could be an issue in itself and and
 
04:30:29.030 --> 04:30:29.040 align:start position:0%
the other question that I had is um do
 
04:30:31.429 --> 04:30:31.439 align:start position:0%
parents always have the right to request
 
04:30:34.030 --> 04:30:34.040 align:start position:0%
these records from the institutions and
 
04:30:36.149 --> 04:30:36.159 align:start position:0%
so say if my child was uh going to
 
04:30:38.189 --> 04:30:38.199 align:start position:0%
school in Rye and I was going to move to
 
04:30:40.870 --> 04:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
Northampton could I request all my
 
04:30:43.710 --> 04:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
child's records from Ry to be sent to
 
04:30:45.349 --> 04:30:45.359 align:start position:0%
Northampton and then Northampton would
 
04:30:47.389 --> 04:30:47.399 align:start position:0%
have the responsibility of retaining
 
04:30:50.189 --> 04:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:50.199 --> 04:30:52.349 align:start position:0%
 
record

04:30:52.349 --> 04:30:52.359 align:start position:0%
record
 
04:30:52.359 --> 04:30:53.870 align:start position:0%
record
so

04:30:53.870 --> 04:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
you a parent could ask a a school to
 
04:31:02.189 --> 04:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
forward the permanent records to to
 
04:31:05.309 --> 04:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
another school district but that's not a
 
04:31:08.750 --> 04:31:08.760 align:start position:0%
requirement the permanent records belong
 
04:31:11.550 --> 04:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
with the um where the student was at the
 
04:31:13.830 --> 04:31:13.840 align:start position:0%
time that record was
 
04:31:16.630 --> 04:31:16.640 align:start position:0%
recorded thank
 
04:31:19.910 --> 04:31:19.920 align:start position:0%
you represent wock yes chairman good
 
04:31:22.750 --> 04:31:22.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon repres Fells um the number of
 
04:31:24.990 --> 04:31:25.000 align:start position:0%
child schools that failed if I recall is
 
04:31:29.870 --> 04:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
very small so I think about six maybe
 
04:31:32.070 --> 04:31:32.080 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is a very limited
 
04:31:32.080 --> 04:31:34.030 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is a very limited
bill

04:31:34.030 --> 04:31:34.040 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:31:38.550 --> 04:31:38.560 align:start position:0%
right well okay I I mean it's not like
 
04:31:39.790 --> 04:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about 100 Schools
 
04:31:41.429 --> 04:31:41.439 align:start position:0%
we're talking about a very small number
 
04:31:42.790 --> 04:31:42.800 align:start position:0%
of schools
 
04:31:45.149 --> 04:31:45.159 align:start position:0%
not suggesting is not valid I'm sesting
 
04:31:46.790 --> 04:31:46.800 align:start position:0%
it's not like the huge issue I mean it's
 
04:31:48.990 --> 04:31:49.000 align:start position:0%
the issue but the number that would be
 
04:31:51.830 --> 04:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
impacted in terms of schools and doe are
 
04:31:56.030 --> 04:31:56.040 align:start position:0%
small um probably the the doe could
 
04:31:58.349 --> 04:31:58.359 align:start position:0%
probably respond better to that I would
 
04:32:02.109 --> 04:32:02.119 align:start position:0%
add that um they're already the doe is
 
04:32:04.870 --> 04:32:04.880 align:start position:0%
already required to maintain the Records
 
04:32:07.269 --> 04:32:07.279 align:start position:0%
for college transcripts when a private
 
04:32:12.109 --> 04:32:12.119 align:start position:0%
college closes so I I okay that's fine
 
04:32:14.269 --> 04:32:14.279 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:32:17.670 --> 04:32:17.680 align:start position:0%
sh I seen no further questions thank you
 
04:32:19.269 --> 04:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
very much
 
04:32:23.229 --> 04:32:23.239 align:start position:0%
representative uh and next um we have
 
04:32:25.670 --> 04:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
two representatives from the Department
 
04:32:35.710 --> 04:32:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:43.389 --> 04:32:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:44.830 --> 04:32:44.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for being here and
 
04:32:46.469 --> 04:32:46.479 align:start position:0%
um I think you've heard some of the
 
04:32:49.429 --> 04:32:49.439 align:start position:0%
questions about uh records and
 
04:32:51.229 --> 04:32:51.239 align:start position:0%
transferring and so forth maybe you
 
04:32:53.469 --> 04:32:53.479 align:start position:0%
could uh help us out with a couple of
 
04:32:55.750 --> 04:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
those so sure and I think some of the
 
04:32:58.389 --> 04:32:58.399 align:start position:0%
questions um are relative to how a local
 
04:33:00.349 --> 04:33:00.359 align:start position:0%
school district handles school records
 
04:33:01.630 --> 04:33:01.640 align:start position:0%
and I do think there are a few
 
04:33:02.670 --> 04:33:02.680 align:start position:0%
representatives from local school
 
04:33:04.590 --> 04:33:04.600 align:start position:0%
districts that might be better um
 
04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
prepared to talk about that than the
 
04:33:09.109 --> 04:33:09.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Education um so and I
 
04:33:10.869 --> 04:33:10.879 align:start position:0%
don't know if they filled out cards but
 
04:33:12.269 --> 04:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
whatnot um
 
04:33:14.709 --> 04:33:14.719 align:start position:0%
relative to the bill in general the
 
04:33:16.551 --> 04:33:16.561 align:start position:0%
Department of Education thinks this is
 
04:33:19.869 --> 04:33:19.879 align:start position:0%
probably um a best practice specifically
 
04:33:23.869 --> 04:33:23.879 align:start position:0%
for closed schools um not only for um
 
04:33:26.230 --> 04:33:26.240 align:start position:0%
chartered Public Schools but also likely
 
04:33:29.109 --> 04:33:29.119 align:start position:0%
non-public schools um we do have
 
04:33:31.551 --> 04:33:31.561 align:start position:0%
challenges with individuals um when
 
04:33:34.029 --> 04:33:34.039 align:start position:0%
their schools have closed getting access
 
04:33:36.310 --> 04:33:36.320 align:start position:0%
to their Student Records um and having
 
04:33:38.949 --> 04:33:38.959 align:start position:0%
some sort of Statewide consistency and
 
04:33:40.830 --> 04:33:40.840 align:start position:0%
practice would be helpful for
 
04:33:43.310 --> 04:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
individuals um that attended these
 
04:33:45.230 --> 04:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
institutions because oftentimes
 
04:33:46.709 --> 04:33:46.719 align:start position:0%
especially high school transcripts are
 
04:33:49.629 --> 04:33:49.639 align:start position:0%
needed for employment military service
 
04:33:52.150 --> 04:33:52.160 align:start position:0%
um continuing education and whatnot and
 
04:33:54.310 --> 04:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
so um we do have a fair number of people
 
04:33:55.949 --> 04:33:55.959 align:start position:0%
that reach out to the department on a
 
04:33:58.189 --> 04:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
fairly regular basis looking for these
 
04:34:00.990 --> 04:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
types of trans transcripts tal has some
 
04:34:02.750 --> 04:34:02.760 align:start position:0%
more information and he handles a lot of
 
04:34:04.590 --> 04:34:04.600 align:start position:0%
the information that comes in right now
 
04:34:06.750 --> 04:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
but just high level so the department of
 
04:34:08.510 --> 04:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
education does already have this
 
04:34:11.150 --> 04:34:11.160 align:start position:0%
function for um career schools and
 
04:34:13.390 --> 04:34:13.400 align:start position:0%
Institution of higher educations that
 
04:34:16.949 --> 04:34:16.959 align:start position:0%
close um and so when a institution of
 
04:34:18.150 --> 04:34:18.160 align:start position:0%
higher education in the state of New
 
04:34:19.910 --> 04:34:19.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire closes they give all of the
 
04:34:21.310 --> 04:34:21.320 align:start position:0%
records to the Department of Education
 
04:34:23.789 --> 04:34:23.799 align:start position:0%
and we we do have a part-time employee
 
04:34:26.109 --> 04:34:26.119 align:start position:0%
at the department that their job is to
 
04:34:29.590 --> 04:34:29.600 align:start position:0%
issue transcripts and Student Records um
 
04:34:31.429 --> 04:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
the Department's biggest challenge with
 
04:34:33.070 --> 04:34:33.080 align:start position:0%
the way this bill is written right now
 
04:34:35.109 --> 04:34:35.119 align:start position:0%
is realistically the resources to do
 
04:34:38.070 --> 04:34:38.080 align:start position:0%
this request so for postsecondary
 
04:34:39.990 --> 04:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
records the department has the authority
 
04:34:43.709 --> 04:34:43.719 align:start position:0%
to charge $25 um a transcript that one
 
04:34:45.349 --> 04:34:45.359 align:start position:0%
pays for the position and the work that
 
04:34:47.750 --> 04:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
the position does in that person's time
 
04:34:49.310 --> 04:34:49.320 align:start position:0%
it also pays for you know special
 
04:34:51.390 --> 04:34:51.400 align:start position:0%
transcript papers and whatnot that's
 
04:34:53.629 --> 04:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
used for issuing the transcripts and a
 
04:34:55.429 --> 04:34:55.439 align:start position:0%
lot of times there's mailing expenses
 
04:34:57.189 --> 04:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
because oftentimes with transcripts they
 
04:35:00.551 --> 04:35:00.561 align:start position:0%
are mailed directly to um directly to an
 
04:35:03.709 --> 04:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
institution or to um somebody might who
 
04:35:05.070 --> 04:35:05.080 align:start position:0%
like might live out of state so there
 
04:35:06.551 --> 04:35:06.561 align:start position:0%
are some costs that the department
 
04:35:08.109 --> 04:35:08.119 align:start position:0%
occurs with this and so for the
 
04:35:09.789 --> 04:35:09.799 align:start position:0%
postsecondary we already have a way of
 
04:35:12.349 --> 04:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
doing that with with the the fee me ISM
 
04:35:13.869 --> 04:35:13.879 align:start position:0%
there's times that an individual may
 
04:35:16.230 --> 04:35:16.240 align:start position:0%
need 10 copies of a record um if they
 
04:35:18.269 --> 04:35:18.279 align:start position:0%
are um if they're you know seeking
 
04:35:20.230 --> 04:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
employment or or trying to go to college
 
04:35:22.269 --> 04:35:22.279 align:start position:0%
or something like that so that it is a a
 
04:35:24.510 --> 04:35:24.520 align:start position:0%
process that we follow um but with that
 
04:35:26.390 --> 04:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
so I think T is going to kind of clarify
 
04:35:28.269 --> 04:35:28.279 align:start position:0%
some additional kind of questions or
 
04:35:29.830 --> 04:35:29.840 align:start position:0%
concerns we have with the way the leg
 
04:35:31.750 --> 04:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
the legislation is and then we can kind
 
04:35:33.629 --> 04:35:33.639 align:start position:0%
of talk through the
 
04:35:36.990 --> 04:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
process awesome I'll try not to repeat
 
04:35:39.590 --> 04:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
any of Caitlyn's comments um first off
 
04:35:42.551 --> 04:35:42.561 align:start position:0%
um we do um
 
04:35:44.629 --> 04:35:44.639 align:start position:0%
support the distinction between within
 
04:35:47.029 --> 04:35:47.039 align:start position:0%
HB 740 with the distinction applying
 
04:35:49.349 --> 04:35:49.359 align:start position:0%
only to State authorized Charter Schools
 
04:35:51.070 --> 04:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
um not including the language uh
 
04:35:53.390 --> 04:35:53.400 align:start position:0%
District approved Charter Schools um we
 
04:35:55.910 --> 04:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
did however have objection uh to the
 
04:35:57.670 --> 04:35:57.680 align:start position:0%
wording of uh provision of Student
 
04:35:59.349 --> 04:35:59.359 align:start position:0%
Records being provided by the department
 
04:36:01.629 --> 04:36:01.639 align:start position:0%
at no cost as Caitlyn mentioned the
 
04:36:03.390 --> 04:36:03.400 align:start position:0%
department has existing practices that
 
04:36:04.830 --> 04:36:04.840 align:start position:0%
support the provision of student records
 
04:36:07.349 --> 04:36:07.359 align:start position:0%
and transcripts from closed career
 
04:36:09.310 --> 04:36:09.320 align:start position:0%
schools and institutions of higher
 
04:36:11.789 --> 04:36:11.799 align:start position:0%
education that um these are self-funded
 
04:36:14.109 --> 04:36:14.119 align:start position:0%
through fees that are charged as Caitlyn
 
04:36:15.910 --> 04:36:15.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned it's a nominal fee of
 
04:36:18.429 --> 04:36:18.439 align:start position:0%
$25 um this fee covers all the time
 
04:36:20.510 --> 04:36:20.520 align:start position:0%
effort printing postage required for
 
04:36:23.070 --> 04:36:23.080 align:start position:0%
these certified uh transcripts for
 
04:36:25.429 --> 04:36:25.439 align:start position:0%
consistency sake we would request that
 
04:36:28.629 --> 04:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
the same fee uh structure be applied um
 
04:36:31.990 --> 04:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
in this particular case um so that we
 
04:36:34.070 --> 04:36:34.080 align:start position:0%
could allocate appropriate time and
 
04:36:36.750 --> 04:36:36.760 align:start position:0%
resources uh within the department
 
04:36:38.551 --> 04:36:38.561 align:start position:0%
additionally we would also request that
 
04:36:40.629 --> 04:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
the department have rule making
 
04:36:42.150 --> 04:36:42.160 align:start position:0%
Authority um
 
04:36:44.869 --> 04:36:44.879 align:start position:0%
with this um for earlier clarification
 
04:36:45.910 --> 04:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
just because I know there was some
 
04:36:47.869 --> 04:36:47.879 align:start position:0%
discussion about existing practices with
 
04:36:50.629 --> 04:36:50.639 align:start position:0%
records um I would mention that
 
04:36:55.869 --> 04:36:55.879 align:start position:0%
RSA uh 194 B16 section 7 does address in
 
04:36:58.269 --> 04:36:58.279 align:start position:0%
the event of voluntary or involuntary
 
04:37:00.629 --> 04:37:00.639 align:start position:0%
dissolution of a Charter Public School
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
remaining Student Records maintained by
 
04:37:04.029 --> 04:37:04.039 align:start position:0%
the charter school shall be forward to
 
04:37:07.949 --> 04:37:07.959 align:start position:0%
the Department of Ed if all records
 
04:37:11.109 --> 04:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
maintained um sorry having to do a
 
04:37:13.109 --> 04:37:13.119 align:start position:0%
little scroll rolling maintained by the
 
04:37:14.670 --> 04:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
charter school have not been forwarded
 
04:37:17.750 --> 04:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
to the schools uh the students District
 
04:37:20.551 --> 04:37:20.561 align:start position:0%
of residence um where this has created
 
04:37:23.750 --> 04:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
some challenges is um essentially a
 
04:37:26.349 --> 04:37:26.359 align:start position:0%
student leaves the closed Charter School
 
04:37:27.551 --> 04:37:27.561 align:start position:0%
they've indicated they're going to go to
 
04:37:29.750 --> 04:37:29.760 align:start position:0%
a district or in some cases a private
 
04:37:33.230 --> 04:37:33.240 align:start position:0%
school uh or some cases home school but
 
04:37:34.949 --> 04:37:34.959 align:start position:0%
if the district or excuse me if the
 
04:37:36.429 --> 04:37:36.439 align:start position:0%
records are going to be forwarded
 
04:37:38.429 --> 04:37:38.439 align:start position:0%
they're forwarded over we've had
 
04:37:38.439 --> 04:37:40.150 align:start position:0%
they're forwarded over we've had
situations

04:37:40.150 --> 04:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
situations
 
04:37:42.670 --> 04:37:42.680 align:start position:0%
where the assumptions made the students
 
04:37:45.150 --> 04:37:45.160 align:start position:0%
there records are done the school closed
 
04:37:46.709 --> 04:37:46.719 align:start position:0%
and then four months later we're getting
 
04:37:48.949 --> 04:37:48.959 align:start position:0%
a request for for records that we don't
 
04:37:51.230 --> 04:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
have because they were under the list as
 
04:37:52.910 --> 04:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
having transferred to a district
 
04:37:54.949 --> 04:37:54.959 align:start position:0%
approved Charter and then suddenly we
 
04:37:57.869 --> 04:37:57.879 align:start position:0%
have no ability to find resolution for
 
04:38:00.990 --> 04:38:01.000 align:start position:0%
that situation so um this new law
 
04:38:02.990 --> 04:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
appears to close that loophole because
 
04:38:04.750 --> 04:38:04.760 align:start position:0%
we would essentially be getting copies
 
04:38:07.109 --> 04:38:07.119 align:start position:0%
of all records so that in the event that
 
04:38:08.990 --> 04:38:09.000 align:start position:0%
a district did not receive records we
 
04:38:10.390 --> 04:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
would at least have something to be able
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
to help resolve the issue
 
04:38:17.390 --> 04:38:17.400 align:start position:0%
um I think that's about it any
 
04:38:19.869 --> 04:38:19.879 align:start position:0%
questions representative McDonald thank
 
04:38:21.670 --> 04:38:21.680 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you both for
 
04:38:23.310 --> 04:38:23.320 align:start position:0%
being here I appreciate the
 
04:38:25.510 --> 04:38:25.520 align:start position:0%
clarification on a lot of these points
 
04:38:28.590 --> 04:38:28.600 align:start position:0%
you did mention the at no cost element
 
04:38:31.949 --> 04:38:31.959 align:start position:0%
which I did not pick up on before um are
 
04:38:34.670 --> 04:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
you aware of any public high schools
 
04:38:37.150 --> 04:38:37.160 align:start position:0%
that charge someone to receive their
 
04:38:41.070 --> 04:38:41.080 align:start position:0%
transcript or is is that the case or are
 
04:38:43.590 --> 04:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
they offered at no cost um I'm not sure
 
04:38:44.910 --> 04:38:44.920 align:start position:0%
what the process is for public high
 
04:38:47.230 --> 04:38:47.240 align:start position:0%
schools okay thank
 
04:38:50.349 --> 04:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
you I would just add on that I I looked
 
04:38:52.150 --> 04:38:52.160 align:start position:0%
up three just as I was heading out the
 
04:38:55.750 --> 04:38:55.760 align:start position:0%
door the three that I looked up did
 
04:38:55.760 --> 04:38:58.590 align:start position:0%
door the three that I looked up did
not

04:38:58.590 --> 04:38:58.600 align:start position:0%
not
 
04:39:00.590 --> 04:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
Rend and thank you for taking my
 
04:39:02.590 --> 04:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
question if I remember in our
 
04:39:05.230 --> 04:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
introductory I'm new to this committee
 
04:39:07.670 --> 04:39:07.680 align:start position:0%
um and I could have been wrong I I
 
04:39:10.510 --> 04:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
thought that there were no District
 
04:39:12.150 --> 04:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
approved charters as of right now is
 
04:39:14.670 --> 04:39:14.680 align:start position:0%
that true or is that my memory there are
 
04:39:17.029 --> 04:39:17.039 align:start position:0%
currently not any okay follow up if I
 
04:39:19.990 --> 04:39:20.000 align:start position:0%
may yes and in the event that a school
 
04:39:22.789 --> 04:39:22.799 align:start position:0%
were to dissolve let's say and you had a
 
04:39:24.990 --> 04:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
100 students there and you were asking
 
04:39:28.070 --> 04:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
for the $25 that would be $2,500
 
04:39:30.590 --> 04:39:30.600 align:start position:0%
potentially worth of Records requests
 
04:39:32.470 --> 04:39:32.480 align:start position:0%
that could potentially come in if maybe
 
04:39:36.070 --> 04:39:36.080 align:start position:0%
more um would it be incumbent upon the
 
04:39:39.270 --> 04:39:39.280 align:start position:0%
closing board of directors to supply
 
04:39:41.830 --> 04:39:41.840 align:start position:0%
those funds to you or would that be for
 
04:39:44.788 --> 04:39:44.798 align:start position:0%
I guess going on your question so the
 
04:39:47.590 --> 04:39:47.600 align:start position:0%
$25 the department um C for our current
 
04:39:49.350 --> 04:39:49.360 align:start position:0%
process we charge when an individual
 
04:39:52.150 --> 04:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
needs access to their records so often
 
04:39:55.270 --> 04:39:55.280 align:start position:0%
times this is 10 11 15 years after
 
04:39:56.948 --> 04:39:56.958 align:start position:0%
school has closed and somebody needs
 
04:39:59.310 --> 04:39:59.320 align:start position:0%
those records so the closing school does
 
04:40:01.270 --> 04:40:01.280 align:start position:0%
not pay for that right now we did have
 
04:40:03.948 --> 04:40:03.958 align:start position:0%
two schools closed last year we were
 
04:40:05.948 --> 04:40:05.958 align:start position:0%
fortunately able to work with them to
 
04:40:08.628 --> 04:40:08.638 align:start position:0%
get the records for that but because of
 
04:40:11.310 --> 04:40:11.320 align:start position:0%
kind of the the lack of clarity and and
 
04:40:14.350 --> 04:40:14.360 align:start position:0%
kind of rules right now um the schools
 
04:40:18.230 --> 04:40:18.240 align:start position:0%
had just worked with us and and provided
 
04:40:19.350 --> 04:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
those records but we didn't necessarily
 
04:40:20.910 --> 04:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
have a formal
 
04:40:23.510 --> 04:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
process represent Woodcock no the
 
04:40:28.110 --> 04:40:28.120 align:start position:0%
question is okay represent s thank you
 
04:40:29.670 --> 04:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I
 
04:40:30.910 --> 04:40:30.920 align:start position:0%
just want to make sure that I understood
 
04:40:33.150 --> 04:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
part of your comment that you would
 
04:40:34.990 --> 04:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
actually prefer if we amended this bill
 
04:40:37.948 --> 04:40:37.958 align:start position:0%
not just to add a an appropriate fee for
 
04:40:40.150 --> 04:40:40.160 align:start position:0%
the service of retrieval of transcripts
 
04:40:43.470 --> 04:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
but also to increase the bill um related
 
04:40:45.788 --> 04:40:45.798 align:start position:0%
to private schools that should close is
 
04:40:48.750 --> 04:40:48.760 align:start position:0%
that correct so um yes because so we
 
04:40:50.470 --> 04:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
have the exact same challenges that
 
04:40:51.868 --> 04:40:51.878 align:start position:0%
we've just described relative to
 
04:40:54.070 --> 04:40:54.080 align:start position:0%
chartered Public Schools exists for um
 
04:40:56.830 --> 04:40:56.840 align:start position:0%
non-public schools when they close um so
 
04:41:00.510 --> 04:41:00.520 align:start position:0%
um we and it's actually sometimes these
 
04:41:01.948 --> 04:41:01.958 align:start position:0%
are even more challenging with
 
04:41:03.470 --> 04:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
non-public schools for chartered Public
 
04:41:05.470 --> 04:41:05.480 align:start position:0%
Schools chartered public schools are at
 
04:41:07.350 --> 04:41:07.360 align:start position:0%
least required to give the Department of
 
04:41:09.750 --> 04:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
Education rosters and student data in
 
04:41:11.310 --> 04:41:11.320 align:start position:0%
the same form that a district public
 
04:41:13.230 --> 04:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
school did so we can at least at times
 
04:41:14.990 --> 04:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
you know at least verify an attendance
 
04:41:17.070 --> 04:41:17.080 align:start position:0%
for somebody at a school for non-public
 
04:41:18.590 --> 04:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
schools we don't have that information
 
04:41:21.230 --> 04:41:21.240 align:start position:0%
at all um and so we do have you know a
 
04:41:22.628 --> 04:41:22.638 align:start position:0%
fair number of people that reach out to
 
04:41:24.750 --> 04:41:24.760 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education on a regular
 
04:41:26.708 --> 04:41:26.718 align:start position:0%
basis looking for their transcripts um
 
04:41:27.788 --> 04:41:27.798 align:start position:0%
somebody actually just reached out to
 
04:41:29.310 --> 04:41:29.320 align:start position:0%
town not too long ago they were looking
 
04:41:31.030 --> 04:41:31.040 align:start position:0%
for their transcripts from a school um
 
04:41:32.670 --> 04:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
from the 1970s they had thought it was a
 
04:41:34.070 --> 04:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
charter school but it we didn't have
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools back then um so it so I
 
04:41:40.510 --> 04:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
think it's really the best practice for
 
04:41:42.990 --> 04:41:43.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire residents or students um
 
04:41:45.030 --> 04:41:45.040 align:start position:0%
if the if there's one consistent
 
04:41:47.270 --> 04:41:47.280 align:start position:0%
practice going forward the other thing
 
04:41:49.270 --> 04:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
that I didn't say either is so you may
 
04:41:51.070 --> 04:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
have a charter school that's located and
 
04:41:52.948 --> 04:41:52.958 align:start position:0%
conquered but you may have kids that are
 
04:41:54.708 --> 04:41:54.718 align:start position:0%
coming from all over the place and it
 
04:41:57.270 --> 04:41:57.280 align:start position:0%
may be hard for that student to know
 
04:41:58.670 --> 04:41:58.680 align:start position:0%
where their records are transferred if
 
04:42:00.270 --> 04:42:00.280 align:start position:0%
they were transferred to a resident
 
04:42:02.948 --> 04:42:02.958 align:start position:0%
district and and whatnot so continuity
 
04:42:04.550 --> 04:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
would be very helpful for
 
04:42:08.750 --> 04:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
them pH thank you and and to the extent
 
04:42:10.910 --> 04:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
that you have language around um the
 
04:42:14.708 --> 04:42:14.718 align:start position:0%
collect of um records from I believe the
 
04:42:18.430 --> 04:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
term was uh from private colleges and
 
04:42:22.750 --> 04:42:22.760 align:start position:0%
from um um I forget the were technical
 
04:42:25.150 --> 04:42:25.160 align:start position:0%
schools that that have closed could you
 
04:42:28.030 --> 04:42:28.040 align:start position:0%
share that language with us of or what
 
04:42:30.868 --> 04:42:30.878 align:start position:0%
RSA it is that specifically addresses
 
04:42:33.230 --> 04:42:33.240 align:start position:0%
the um open open your teams the records
 
04:42:35.310 --> 04:42:35.320 align:start position:0%
there hold on one second I my message it
 
04:42:36.390 --> 04:42:36.400 align:start position:0%
to him earlier today when we were
 
04:42:38.310 --> 04:42:38.320 align:start position:0%
preparing yes I just that would be very
 
04:42:39.590 --> 04:42:39.600 align:start position:0%
helpful for us to have the specific
 
04:42:42.868 --> 04:42:42.878 align:start position:0%
langage RSA uh
 
04:42:42.878 --> 04:42:45.550 align:start position:0%
langage RSA uh
2928

04:42:45.550 --> 04:42:45.560 align:start position:0%
2928
 
04:42:49.868 --> 04:42:49.878 align:start position:0%
DKK and there are also rules that um go
 
04:42:51.830 --> 04:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
with this but I don't know the rule
 
04:42:53.230 --> 04:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
reference off of the top of my head
 
04:42:56.990 --> 04:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
could you repeat that RSA number 292 292
 
04:43:04.190 --> 04:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:06.830 --> 04:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
required thank you so very
 
04:43:12.030 --> 04:43:12.040 align:start position:0%
much and uh that uh 292 section um is
 
04:43:14.470 --> 04:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
related to is it for higher education
 
04:43:16.510 --> 04:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
yeah this is the existing law for higher
 
04:43:18.670 --> 04:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
education so it says any institution of
 
04:43:20.510 --> 04:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
higher education blah blah blah blah
 
04:43:25.910 --> 04:43:25.920 align:start position:0%
goes on right okay thank you any rest Mr
 
04:43:28.310 --> 04:43:28.320 align:start position:0%
representative Woodcock thank you follow
 
04:43:30.830 --> 04:43:30.840 align:start position:0%
to my question from before what are the
 
04:43:32.230 --> 04:43:32.240 align:start position:0%
number what number are we talking about
 
04:43:34.670 --> 04:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
kayin we talk about five or 500 what we
 
04:43:36.270 --> 04:43:36.280 align:start position:0%
talking about we've had 10 charter
 
04:43:38.190 --> 04:43:38.200 align:start position:0%
schools closed in the existence of
 
04:43:40.390 --> 04:43:40.400 align:start position:0%
charter schools the total enrollment of
 
04:43:43.830 --> 04:43:43.840 align:start position:0%
those schools was 2300 kids now that
 
04:43:46.350 --> 04:43:46.360 align:start position:0%
might not be 2300 unique kids I didn't
 
04:43:48.628 --> 04:43:48.638 align:start position:0%
go through and count the actual sassad
 
04:43:50.708 --> 04:43:50.718 align:start position:0%
numbers um associated with those kids
 
04:43:53.070 --> 04:43:53.080 align:start position:0%
but I mean and as time goes on more
 
04:43:55.230 --> 04:43:55.240 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools May close non-public
 
04:43:57.750 --> 04:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
schools there's probably thousands of
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
them because those are um those probably
 
04:44:02.948 --> 04:44:02.958 align:start position:0%
they have a longer history and those
 
04:44:05.350 --> 04:44:05.360 align:start position:0%
close more thank you so much thank
 
04:44:07.550 --> 04:44:07.560 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
04:44:10.470 --> 04:44:10.480 align:start position:0%
questions see none thank you very much
 
04:44:14.590 --> 04:44:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:14.600 --> 04:44:29.868 align:start position:0%

Barker
 
04:44:34.788 --> 04:44:34.798 align:start position:0%
y y got it now I see it I was just
 
04:44:36.270 --> 04:44:36.280 align:start position:0%
confused I wasn't sure was it supposed
 
04:44:38.990 --> 04:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
to be right on my side uh good afternoon
 
04:44:41.510 --> 04:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for letting me speak today I
 
04:44:44.310 --> 04:44:44.320 align:start position:0%
actually popped down for this um bill in
 
04:44:45.990 --> 04:44:46.000 align:start position:0%
support of it from New Hampshire school
 
04:44:46.000 --> 04:44:47.590 align:start position:0%
support of it from New Hampshire school
administrators

04:44:47.590 --> 04:44:47.600 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
04:44:51.030 --> 04:44:51.040 align:start position:0%
Association Heather Barker yep and I'm
 
04:44:53.670 --> 04:44:53.680 align:start position:0%
the student services uh director there
 
04:44:53.680 --> 04:44:55.150 align:start position:0%
the student services uh director there
at

04:44:55.150 --> 04:44:55.160 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:44:57.948 --> 04:44:57.958 align:start position:0%
nhsaa the main reason that I would
 
04:45:01.110 --> 04:45:01.120 align:start position:0%
support this bill is because children
 
04:45:03.948 --> 04:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
and families are protected when you have
 
04:45:06.230 --> 04:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
something like this there's there's
 
04:45:07.948 --> 04:45:07.958 align:start position:0%
having worked in conquer at the big
 
04:45:10.110 --> 04:45:10.120 align:start position:0%
Middle School we had students who moved
 
04:45:11.670 --> 04:45:11.680 align:start position:0%
back and forth between Charter Schools
 
04:45:13.910 --> 04:45:13.920 align:start position:0%
or private schools or home education
 
04:45:16.390 --> 04:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
back into the school sometimes moving
 
04:45:18.868 --> 04:45:18.878 align:start position:0%
back and forth and when you don't have
 
04:45:21.750 --> 04:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
those records it's very hard to
 
04:45:25.788 --> 04:45:25.798 align:start position:0%
determine um how to place a student uh
 
04:45:27.350 --> 04:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
what kind of courses for example they
 
04:45:29.310 --> 04:45:29.320 align:start position:0%
have taken giving making sure that they
 
04:45:31.628 --> 04:45:31.638 align:start position:0%
are getting credit for courses that they
 
04:45:35.390 --> 04:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
have taken and earned um the credit for
 
04:45:38.270 --> 04:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
those so having also worked with Charter
 
04:45:42.070 --> 04:45:42.080 align:start position:0%
Schools they have um different practices
 
04:45:43.750 --> 04:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
from one to the next which is all part
 
04:45:45.390 --> 04:45:45.400 align:start position:0%
of why that's important when they have
 
04:45:47.110 --> 04:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
their Charter designing how they're
 
04:45:49.550 --> 04:45:49.560 align:start position:0%
going to do that but having somewhere or
 
04:45:51.510 --> 04:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
some in this case the Department of
 
04:45:53.948 --> 04:45:53.958 align:start position:0%
Education be the institution that
 
04:45:58.750 --> 04:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
protects those records if such school
 
04:46:01.708 --> 04:46:01.718 align:start position:0%
closes right becomes really important
 
04:46:05.350 --> 04:46:05.360 align:start position:0%
for that child and family I you know I
 
04:46:07.150 --> 04:46:07.160 align:start position:0%
hear what the department of EDS said
 
04:46:11.430 --> 04:46:11.440 align:start position:0%
about um a fee I I get that in public
 
04:46:14.390 --> 04:46:14.400 align:start position:0%
schools we typically don't charge a fee
 
04:46:15.948 --> 04:46:15.958 align:start position:0%
um and that's probably because you're
 
04:46:17.110 --> 04:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
not when you're thinking about higher
 
04:46:19.070 --> 04:46:19.080 align:start position:0%
education it makes sense because you
 
04:46:22.670 --> 04:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
need a record um of note that's actually
 
04:46:22.680 --> 04:46:23.910 align:start position:0%
need a record um of note that's actually
the

04:46:23.910 --> 04:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:46:27.390 --> 04:46:27.400 align:start position:0%
um formal record for the student and you
 
04:46:29.230 --> 04:46:29.240 align:start position:0%
also have informal records so for
 
04:46:31.270 --> 04:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
example a student and a parent could ask
 
04:46:33.670 --> 04:46:33.680 align:start position:0%
for a copy of a record that's not a
 
04:46:35.590 --> 04:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
formal record that's going to be stamped
 
04:46:38.708 --> 04:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
to be used perhaps that fee is $5 some
 
04:46:40.270 --> 04:46:40.280 align:start position:0%
some universities do that they have a
 
04:46:43.830 --> 04:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
different weighted cost for the formal
 
04:46:46.110 --> 04:46:46.120 align:start position:0%
one that's going to be used um when
 
04:46:47.750 --> 04:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
someone's applying for a job or applying
 
04:46:49.270 --> 04:46:49.280 align:start position:0%
to college or to go to another
 
04:46:51.270 --> 04:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
institution and then there's the records
 
04:46:52.910 --> 04:46:52.920 align:start position:0%
that the parent and child have access to
 
04:46:56.030 --> 04:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
in this case I I'm not sure that would
 
04:46:57.390 --> 04:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
be a new thing and I had really thought
 
04:46:59.470 --> 04:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
about it but I wholeheartedly support
 
04:47:02.470 --> 04:47:02.480 align:start position:0%
the idea that children and families have
 
04:47:04.948 --> 04:47:04.958 align:start position:0%
the protection that some some
 
04:47:07.070 --> 04:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
institution the state of New Hampshire
 
04:47:08.628 --> 04:47:08.638 align:start position:0%
is going to be responsible for
 
04:47:10.150 --> 04:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
protecting those records for those
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
children and families
 
04:47:14.030 --> 04:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
so that's my take on
 
04:47:17.868 --> 04:47:17.878 align:start position:0%
that thank you very much any questions
 
04:47:19.830 --> 04:47:19.840 align:start position:0%
great thank you great see none thank you
 
04:47:23.270 --> 04:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
very much and with that we'll close the
 
04:47:27.270 --> 04:47:27.280 align:start position:0%
hearing on House Bill 740 and in a
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%

Bill
 
04:59:22.910 --> 04:59:22.920 align:start position:0%
719 repealing the use of unused District
 
04:59:25.430 --> 04:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
facilities by chartered public schools
 
04:59:27.788 --> 04:59:27.798 align:start position:0%
and representative K is kahill is here
 
04:59:29.868 --> 04:59:29.878 align:start position:0%
to present his Bill thank you for being
 
04:59:33.750 --> 04:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chairman and if I may
 
04:59:35.350 --> 04:59:35.360 align:start position:0%
have a just a moment of
 
04:59:37.990 --> 04:59:38.000 align:start position:0%
indulgence up until 8:30 this morning I
 
04:59:39.548 --> 04:59:39.558 align:start position:0%
didn't know this hearing was scheduled
 
04:59:39.558 --> 04:59:41.070 align:start position:0%
didn't know this hearing was scheduled
today

04:59:41.070 --> 04:59:41.080 align:start position:0%
today
 
04:59:42.990 --> 04:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
and so this is this was done in haste
 
04:59:44.590 --> 04:59:44.600 align:start position:0%
and there was a lot of other plans
 
04:59:47.070 --> 04:59:47.080 align:start position:0%
changed and disruptions and things but I
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
went through looking through I was
 
04:59:49.670 --> 04:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
looking through this because this is my
 
04:59:51.708 --> 04:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
last bill and I hadn't noticed the
 
04:59:52.670 --> 04:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and then I look through the
 
04:59:56.868 --> 04:59:56.878 align:start position:0%
email and I see EPA notice and when I
 
04:59:58.548 --> 04:59:58.558 align:start position:0%
saw that because there are so many
 
05:00:01.868 --> 05:00:01.878 align:start position:0%
emails and so many bills I thought why
 
05:00:05.830 --> 05:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
is the EPA telling me so I that's why I
 
05:00:08.670 --> 05:00:08.680 align:start position:0%
didn't take note of it earlier and get
 
05:00:11.628 --> 05:00:11.638 align:start position:0%
all ready and I I have requested that
 
05:00:13.150 --> 05:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
EPA be
 
05:00:16.230 --> 05:00:16.240 align:start position:0%
changed um but uh that was a while ago
 
05:00:19.150 --> 05:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
so I'm not holding my breath um and just
 
05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
to sympathize with you um the first bill
 
05:00:24.350 --> 05:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
this afternoon was mine and I discovered
 
05:00:27.628 --> 05:00:27.638 align:start position:0%
that about a half an hour before the
 
05:00:30.430 --> 05:00:30.440 align:start position:0%
hearing so uh so welcome I'm glad you're
 
05:00:34.070 --> 05:00:34.080 align:start position:0%
here thank you sir um so you'll recall a
 
05:00:36.990 --> 05:00:37.000 align:start position:0%
few years ago uh there was a bill passed
 
05:00:40.030 --> 05:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
that um said that if there was unused
 
05:00:42.470 --> 05:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
space in a building or a building it
 
05:00:45.150 --> 05:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
first dibs to would be to charart of
 
05:00:49.548 --> 05:00:49.558 align:start position:0%
school and I think that that decision
 
05:00:51.030 --> 05:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
really should be left to the people in
 
05:00:53.430 --> 05:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
the community that built the school that
 
05:00:55.150 --> 05:00:55.160 align:start position:0%
have had their you know their children
 
05:00:56.310 --> 05:00:56.320 align:start position:0%
go to school there maybe their
 
05:00:58.070 --> 05:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
grandchildren are there now and maybe
 
05:01:00.070 --> 05:01:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's come a time when that building
 
05:01:04.788 --> 05:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
is no longer needed or usable and maybe
 
05:01:07.868 --> 05:01:07.878 align:start position:0%
they would like to see housing or a
 
05:01:10.788 --> 05:01:10.798 align:start position:0%
community center or
 
05:01:12.548 --> 05:01:12.558 align:start position:0%
some sort of other business that would
 
05:01:14.070 --> 05:01:14.080 align:start position:0%
you know have a lot of employment for
 
05:01:17.030 --> 05:01:17.040 align:start position:0%
the town and but if if they want to have
 
05:01:18.750 --> 05:01:18.760 align:start position:0%
a charter school I think that's another
 
05:01:20.708 --> 05:01:20.718 align:start position:0%
option but it shouldn't be a preference
 
05:01:23.110 --> 05:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
that they have to get through per first
 
05:01:24.750 --> 05:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
so that's what I was thinking when I
 
05:01:26.150 --> 05:01:26.160 align:start position:0%
when I wrote this and I know I've
 
05:01:29.910 --> 05:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
emailed this to the committee uh not
 
05:01:32.910 --> 05:01:32.920 align:start position:0%
that long ago today but I I will read it
 
05:01:34.270 --> 05:01:34.280 align:start position:0%
just you know I'm going to do a little
 
05:01:36.350 --> 05:01:36.360 align:start position:0%
skimming you know but I will read it for
 
05:01:40.350 --> 05:01:40.360 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the uh public so uh our
 
05:01:42.030 --> 05:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
schools in addition to providing
 
05:01:44.230 --> 05:01:44.240 align:start position:0%
education are centers of community where
 
05:01:46.830 --> 05:01:46.840 align:start position:0%
children and parents form bonds some of
 
05:01:49.548 --> 05:01:49.558 align:start position:0%
which last a lifetime it is not uncommon
 
05:01:51.470 --> 05:01:51.480 align:start position:0%
for teachers to have the children of
 
05:01:53.910 --> 05:01:53.920 align:start position:0%
their former students in their classroom
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
our school buildings provide several
 
05:01:57.990 --> 05:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
generations with this grounding sense of
 
05:02:00.390 --> 05:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
place and continuity the buildings
 
05:02:01.990 --> 05:02:02.000 align:start position:0%
require maintenance and sometimes
 
05:02:03.868 --> 05:02:03.878 align:start position:0%
renovation and expansion to meet the
 
05:02:06.390 --> 05:02:06.400 align:start position:0%
needs of students in some cases a new
 
05:02:08.948 --> 05:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
building is more cost effective another
 
05:02:11.590 --> 05:02:11.600 align:start position:0%
kind of bond that comes into play here
 
05:02:13.430 --> 05:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
is the one that residents approved in a
 
05:02:15.190 --> 05:02:15.200 align:start position:0%
warrant article needed to fund the
 
05:02:17.310 --> 05:02:17.320 align:start position:0%
project they committed to pay principal
 
05:02:19.628 --> 05:02:19.638 align:start position:0%
and interest for 20 or 30 years using a
 
05:02:21.788 --> 05:02:21.798 align:start position:0%
portion of their property tax so the
 
05:02:24.030 --> 05:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
project could be completed they approved
 
05:02:25.830 --> 05:02:25.840 align:start position:0%
a tax increase because it was in the
 
05:02:27.390 --> 05:02:27.400 align:start position:0%
best interest of the families living in
 
05:02:30.270 --> 05:02:30.280 align:start position:0%
the community they are invested in in
 
05:02:31.910 --> 05:02:31.920 align:start position:0%
the event of a school build a school
 
05:02:33.270 --> 05:02:33.280 align:start position:0%
building to be retired due to
 
05:02:35.110 --> 05:02:35.120 align:start position:0%
replacement or consolidation shouldn't
 
05:02:36.868 --> 05:02:36.878 align:start position:0%
the elected School Board Andor the
 
05:02:38.430 --> 05:02:38.440 align:start position:0%
residents make the decision on the
 
05:02:40.390 --> 05:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
future use of the building
 
05:02:41.990 --> 05:02:42.000 align:start position:0%
they have paid for the construction
 
05:02:43.670 --> 05:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
maintenance and later studies to
 
05:02:45.350 --> 05:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
determine when renovation or new
 
05:02:47.708 --> 05:02:47.718 align:start position:0%
construction were the best path what if
 
05:02:49.390 --> 05:02:49.400 align:start position:0%
they feel the best use of the vacant
 
05:02:51.708 --> 05:02:51.718 align:start position:0%
School building is for housing or for a
 
05:02:54.270 --> 05:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
taxpaying business requiring first
 
05:02:56.070 --> 05:02:56.080 align:start position:0%
refusal for a charter school that would
 
05:02:57.670 --> 05:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
recruit students from outside the
 
05:02:59.750 --> 05:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
community from any distance a parent was
 
05:03:01.830 --> 05:03:01.840 align:start position:0%
willing to drive does nothing for the
 
05:03:04.070 --> 05:03:04.080 align:start position:0%
town's residents the state should not
 
05:03:06.590 --> 05:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
interfere in what is a local decision
 
05:03:07.990 --> 05:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
best left to the residents and their
 
05:03:10.670 --> 05:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
elected government bodies now I I did
 
05:03:13.230 --> 05:03:13.240 align:start position:0%
paste in a couple of Articles here
 
05:03:14.868 --> 05:03:14.878 align:start position:0%
examples you know a little Charter
 
05:03:16.190 --> 05:03:16.200 align:start position:0%
history and I know there are wonderful
 
05:03:18.990 --> 05:03:19.000 align:start position:0%
charter schools that are stable and and
 
05:03:20.590 --> 05:03:20.600 align:start position:0%
doing a great job for the kids that
 
05:03:23.190 --> 05:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
attend but there are other situations
 
05:03:24.670 --> 05:03:24.680 align:start position:0%
one what I want to call your attention
 
05:03:27.390 --> 05:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
to because it's it's about you know what
 
05:03:29.708 --> 05:03:29.718 align:start position:0%
happens when a charter school moves and
 
05:03:32.110 --> 05:03:32.120 align:start position:0%
I know you know schools in our our
 
05:03:34.628 --> 05:03:34.638 align:start position:0%
regular traditional schools don't move
 
05:03:36.628 --> 05:03:36.638 align:start position:0%
uh they may shut down you know but they
 
05:03:38.750 --> 05:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
provide for another another alternative
 
05:03:42.548 --> 05:03:42.558 align:start position:0%
in the district for their kids so uh I I
 
05:03:44.990 --> 05:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
recall this incident that happened at in
 
05:03:49.910 --> 05:03:49.920 align:start position:0%
Kingston where a um Great Bay Community
 
05:03:51.590 --> 05:03:51.600 align:start position:0%
like the great great uh Great Bay
 
05:03:54.750 --> 05:03:54.760 align:start position:0%
Charter or Sea Coast Charter I'm sorry
 
05:03:57.390 --> 05:03:57.400 align:start position:0%
um yeah so the the people moved into
 
05:03:58.948 --> 05:03:58.958 align:start position:0%
school in Kingston that was already in
 
05:04:01.230 --> 05:04:01.240 align:start position:0%
tough shape such it so bad that the
 
05:04:02.868 --> 05:04:02.878 align:start position:0%
people of Kingston This is
 
05:04:05.470 --> 05:04:05.480 align:start position:0%
representative Wilders Town had had
 
05:04:07.310 --> 05:04:07.320 align:start position:0%
decided not to put money into it and to
 
05:04:10.510 --> 05:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
and to build another high school and so
 
05:04:11.868 --> 05:04:11.878 align:start position:0%
uh they didn't need this building it was
 
05:04:13.310 --> 05:04:13.320 align:start position:0%
in poor condition I didn't know what
 
05:04:14.830 --> 05:04:14.840 align:start position:0%
they were thinking they would do with it
 
05:04:16.590 --> 05:04:16.600 align:start position:0%
but a charter school came along and said
 
05:04:18.430 --> 05:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
we' like to lease the building you know
 
05:04:20.910 --> 05:04:20.920 align:start position:0%
until we find something else and you
 
05:04:22.670 --> 05:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
know the building was in poor shape fire
 
05:04:25.150 --> 05:04:25.160 align:start position:0%
and safety issues uh the kind of thing
 
05:04:27.670 --> 05:04:27.680 align:start position:0%
that you know happens in public schools
 
05:04:30.470 --> 05:04:30.480 align:start position:0%
and they had they they Del leased for a
 
05:04:32.070 --> 05:04:32.080 align:start position:0%
while then they gave them an extension
 
05:04:34.070 --> 05:04:34.080 align:start position:0%
and they said we need more time and
 
05:04:35.310 --> 05:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
really the time the time was worried
 
05:04:37.910 --> 05:04:37.920 align:start position:0%
about liability what would happen you in
 
05:04:39.430 --> 05:04:39.440 align:start position:0%
the event that there something terrible
 
05:04:41.070 --> 05:04:41.080 align:start position:0%
happened and somebody some of these kids
 
05:04:44.150 --> 05:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
got hurt so they eventually declined to
 
05:04:46.190 --> 05:04:46.200 align:start position:0%
renew the lease
 
05:04:48.830 --> 05:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
and they went the the charter school
 
05:04:50.270 --> 05:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
went looking for Alternatives they
 
05:04:53.270 --> 05:04:53.280 align:start position:0%
looked at the vacant uh vo vocational
 
05:04:55.830 --> 05:04:55.840 align:start position:0%
training center in stratum still vacant
 
05:04:58.788 --> 05:04:58.798 align:start position:0%
by the way and uh that they they started
 
05:05:00.788 --> 05:05:00.798 align:start position:0%
raising money for that and I remember
 
05:05:03.270 --> 05:05:03.280 align:start position:0%
this particular thing in the paper about
 
05:05:05.190 --> 05:05:05.200 align:start position:0%
a I think it was a second or third
 
05:05:08.750 --> 05:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
grader whose grandmother gave her $500
 
05:05:10.150 --> 05:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
for her birthday
 
05:05:12.390 --> 05:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
and that little girl put $500 toward
 
05:05:14.390 --> 05:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
that Char school because she wanted to
 
05:05:16.230 --> 05:05:16.240 align:start position:0%
keep going to that school she loved the
 
05:05:20.548 --> 05:05:20.558 align:start position:0%
school in the end um they they decided
 
05:05:22.230 --> 05:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
the stratum wasn't going to work out it
 
05:05:23.948 --> 05:05:23.958 align:start position:0%
was going to cost them too much to fix
 
05:05:26.190 --> 05:05:26.200 align:start position:0%
or it was the price was too high they
 
05:05:29.510 --> 05:05:29.520 align:start position:0%
found a spot in Dover and in this in
 
05:05:31.470 --> 05:05:31.480 align:start position:0%
this article the Headmaster of the
 
05:05:34.310 --> 05:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
charter school said I highlighted this
 
05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:43.070 --> 05:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:45.110 --> 05:05:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh he said some parents would be unable
 
05:05:46.628 --> 05:05:46.638 align:start position:0%
to continue sending their children to
 
05:05:48.628 --> 05:05:48.638 align:start position:0%
the school because of the new location
 
05:05:50.708 --> 05:05:50.718 align:start position:0%
but no matter where we moveed stratum or
 
05:05:53.430 --> 05:05:53.440 align:start position:0%
do the distance was a big concern a lot
 
05:05:55.230 --> 05:05:55.240 align:start position:0%
of our families are just not able to
 
05:05:58.070 --> 05:05:58.080 align:start position:0%
make it but our overall goal is the
 
05:05:58.080 --> 05:05:59.990 align:start position:0%
make it but our overall goal is the
school

05:05:59.990 --> 05:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
school
 
05:06:02.430 --> 05:06:02.440 align:start position:0%
sustainability uh D dorso said the SE
 
05:06:03.788 --> 05:06:03.798 align:start position:0%
Coast chart is going to be looking for
 
05:06:05.910 --> 05:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
new families in the Dover and Rochester
 
05:06:08.670 --> 05:06:08.680 align:start position:0%
area to join them now I wondered where
 
05:06:12.230 --> 05:06:12.240 align:start position:0%
that left the the third grader who
 
05:06:14.868 --> 05:06:14.878 align:start position:0%
willingly donated $500 I didn't know if
 
05:06:16.868 --> 05:06:16.878 align:start position:0%
she was going to be making that Journey
 
05:06:20.190 --> 05:06:20.200 align:start position:0%
twice a day uh I'm not sure which of the
 
05:06:22.310 --> 05:06:22.320 align:start position:0%
many towns that were served by the
 
05:06:24.110 --> 05:06:24.120 align:start position:0%
charter school in Kingston I'm not sure
 
05:06:26.868 --> 05:06:26.878 align:start position:0%
how far her parents had to get her to
 
05:06:28.788 --> 05:06:28.798 align:start position:0%
you know in order to be in do and
 
05:06:31.310 --> 05:06:31.320 align:start position:0%
continue the schooling that she wanted
 
05:06:33.310 --> 05:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
she may have in fact returned to the
 
05:06:36.350 --> 05:06:36.360 align:start position:0%
Local District and her in her community
 
05:06:38.948 --> 05:06:38.958 align:start position:0%
and often times they find that that
 
05:06:41.548 --> 05:06:41.558 align:start position:0%
works just fine uh it might have been
 
05:06:43.230 --> 05:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
better than they expected because maybe
 
05:06:45.590 --> 05:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
they' never tried it or it might be that
 
05:06:47.070 --> 05:06:47.080 align:start position:0%
they're they're learning new things and
 
05:06:48.670 --> 05:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
with other kids that they can see in
 
05:06:50.868 --> 05:06:50.878 align:start position:0%
their neighborhoods it's it's sometimes
 
05:06:53.070 --> 05:06:53.080 align:start position:0%
really is a very good experience to get
 
05:06:55.270 --> 05:06:55.280 align:start position:0%
on that yellow bus or or ride with your
 
05:06:57.830 --> 05:06:57.840 align:start position:0%
parents or walk down to the street to
 
05:07:00.150 --> 05:07:00.160 align:start position:0%
that local school that is such a big
 
05:07:02.190 --> 05:07:02.200 align:start position:0%
part of your
 
05:07:06.548 --> 05:07:06.558 align:start position:0%
community um the other one was about and
 
05:07:08.390 --> 05:07:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm afraid this this happens a bit more
 
05:07:10.868 --> 05:07:10.878 align:start position:0%
a bit too often where a charter school
 
05:07:13.628 --> 05:07:13.638 align:start position:0%
opens up and this was one in
 
05:07:13.638 --> 05:07:15.190 align:start position:0%
opens up and this was one in
exor

05:07:15.190 --> 05:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
exor
 
05:07:18.510 --> 05:07:18.520 align:start position:0%
and it it was closing Le less than two
 
05:07:20.830 --> 05:07:20.840 align:start position:0%
years after it opened and I as I recall
 
05:07:23.708 --> 05:07:23.718 align:start position:0%
hearing that they had kids in tents and
 
05:07:25.910 --> 05:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
using portal Nets in November while they
 
05:07:27.310 --> 05:07:27.320 align:start position:0%
were still getting things together with
 
05:07:30.070 --> 05:07:30.080 align:start position:0%
the with the facility and there was
 
05:07:31.990 --> 05:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
there appears to be some sort of
 
05:07:34.670 --> 05:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
financial fraud and mismanagement and I
 
05:07:36.390 --> 05:07:36.400 align:start position:0%
know this has happened before in in
 
05:07:38.750 --> 05:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
another school in conquered and there's
 
05:07:40.788 --> 05:07:40.798 align:start position:0%
others that are
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
questionable and it's not a reliable
 
05:07:46.150 --> 05:07:46.160 align:start position:0%
opportunity for the critical education
 
05:07:47.868 --> 05:07:47.878 align:start position:0%
that we know our children need and
 
05:07:49.788 --> 05:07:49.798 align:start position:0%
deserve uh I think you had some
 
05:07:53.190 --> 05:07:53.200 align:start position:0%
testimony recently about how strongly
 
05:07:55.470 --> 05:07:55.480 align:start position:0%
members of the public feel about their
 
05:07:57.190 --> 05:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
public education the curriculum that
 
05:07:58.788 --> 05:07:58.798 align:start position:0%
that's available to them in their
 
05:08:02.430 --> 05:08:02.440 align:start position:0%
traditional Public Schools so uh I I
 
05:08:03.590 --> 05:08:03.600 align:start position:0%
understand that there is a place for
 
05:08:05.788 --> 05:08:05.798 align:start position:0%
Charters but not every place and I think
 
05:08:08.510 --> 05:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
we've gone out of our way to promote
 
05:08:11.868 --> 05:08:11.878 align:start position:0%
Alternatives when we have a a fine
 
05:08:14.230 --> 05:08:14.240 align:start position:0%
educational system here in New Hampshire
 
05:08:17.230 --> 05:08:17.240 align:start position:0%
could it be funded better you bet but
 
05:08:18.990 --> 05:08:19.000 align:start position:0%
there is really is serving the public
 
05:08:20.948 --> 05:08:20.958 align:start position:0%
serving the needs of the communities
 
05:08:25.470 --> 05:08:25.480 align:start position:0%
where they're located and as I recall uh
 
05:08:28.110 --> 05:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner edel blue and uh
 
05:08:31.310 --> 05:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos uh
 
05:08:34.070 --> 05:08:34.080 align:start position:0%
had $47 million with which to encourage
 
05:08:35.750 --> 05:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
charter schools and I think another wave
 
05:08:38.110 --> 05:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
of that is likely coming in the current
 
05:08:38.120 --> 05:08:39.708 align:start position:0%
of that is likely coming in the current
Administration

05:08:39.708 --> 05:08:39.718 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
05:08:42.750 --> 05:08:42.760 align:start position:0%
and this was as I recall there were 29
 
05:08:44.510 --> 05:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
charter schools at that
 
05:08:47.070 --> 05:08:47.080 align:start position:0%
time and there were according
 
05:08:49.230 --> 05:08:49.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner edbl seven of them were
 
05:08:51.590 --> 05:08:51.600 align:start position:0%
worthy of replication his his
 
05:08:53.830 --> 05:08:53.840 align:start position:0%
description his his decision and I
 
05:08:55.430 --> 05:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
wondered you know why didn't they spend
 
05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
the money improving the other 22 schools
 
05:09:00.868 --> 05:09:00.878 align:start position:0%
instead of expanding something that
 
05:09:04.310 --> 05:09:04.320 align:start position:0%
isn't always the best could you suspend
 
05:09:06.430 --> 05:09:06.440 align:start position:0%
for a minute yes you state your point
 
05:09:06.440 --> 05:09:09.708 align:start position:0%
for a minute yes you state your point
please

05:09:09.708 --> 05:09:09.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:11.948 --> 05:09:11.958 align:start position:0%
related to whether or not that's correct
 
05:09:13.750 --> 05:09:13.760 align:start position:0%
if we could just stick to the bill
 
05:09:16.350 --> 05:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
please uh yeah well I think it is
 
05:09:18.590 --> 05:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
related because when we when we when we
 
05:09:19.788 --> 05:09:19.798 align:start position:0%
take public
 
05:09:23.628 --> 05:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
money and and and uh allow the transfer
 
05:09:25.390 --> 05:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
whether whether it's uh whether it's for
 
05:09:27.390 --> 05:09:27.400 align:start position:0%
building Aid which is the other Bill I'm
 
05:09:30.548 --> 05:09:30.558 align:start position:0%
trying to do something about or allowing
 
05:09:33.628 --> 05:09:33.638 align:start position:0%
the charter schools to come in and buy
 
05:09:35.590 --> 05:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
uh or lease school you know a school
 
05:09:37.670 --> 05:09:37.680 align:start position:0%
building I think it is I think these
 
05:09:39.470 --> 05:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
question these stories are gerain this
 
05:09:41.070 --> 05:09:41.080 align:start position:0%
is about you know the history that we
 
05:09:43.030 --> 05:09:43.040 align:start position:0%
have with charter schools in New
 
05:09:45.310 --> 05:09:45.320 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and if you look in the news
 
05:09:47.590 --> 05:09:47.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see similar stories all across
 
05:09:47.600 --> 05:09:48.270 align:start position:0%
you'll see similar stories all across
the

05:09:48.270 --> 05:09:48.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:09:51.750 --> 05:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
country uh yes some of them are are fine
 
05:09:54.830 --> 05:09:54.840 align:start position:0%
but not everyone and we need not uh make
 
05:09:57.788 --> 05:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
sure this are Charter in every town or
 
05:09:59.990 --> 05:10:00.000 align:start position:0%
uh that everyone has easy access to it
 
05:10:02.990 --> 05:10:03.000 align:start position:0%
it's not necessarily the best and as I
 
05:10:05.430 --> 05:10:05.440 align:start position:0%
also back later in the art in my piece
 
05:10:08.190 --> 05:10:08.200 align:start position:0%
here I did look at the recent test
 
05:10:14.430 --> 05:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:16.868 --> 05:10:16.878 align:start position:0%
reading what order what what the test
 
05:10:19.350 --> 05:10:19.360 align:start position:0%
scores have to do with this bill
 
05:10:22.150 --> 05:10:22.160 align:start position:0%
education education is the central point
 
05:10:25.628 --> 05:10:25.638 align:start position:0%
we can stick to the uh the closing of of
 
05:10:30.230 --> 05:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh um build buildings um and unused
 
05:10:33.868 --> 05:10:33.878 align:start position:0%
space we don't need to get into test
 
05:10:33.878 --> 05:10:35.390 align:start position:0%
space we don't need to get into test
scores

05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
scores
 
05:10:39.390 --> 05:10:39.400 align:start position:0%
um well I mean I I believe the idea
 
05:10:41.910 --> 05:10:41.920 align:start position:0%
funding education and adequate education
 
05:10:45.548 --> 05:10:45.558 align:start position:0%
is includes uh the curriculum the
 
05:10:47.910 --> 05:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
building right we're we're not dealing
 
05:10:49.548 --> 05:10:49.558 align:start position:0%
with funding of Education either oh
 
05:10:50.670 --> 05:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
that's right this is the policy
 
05:10:52.470 --> 05:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
committee yes and when the policy
 
05:10:54.868 --> 05:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
committee you decide what schools get
 
05:10:57.868 --> 05:10:57.878 align:start position:0%
funding and which ones don't or how much
 
05:11:01.110 --> 05:11:01.120 align:start position:0%
perhaps no okay the bill is about the
 
05:11:04.230 --> 05:11:04.240 align:start position:0%
bill is about allowing the community to
 
05:11:06.548 --> 05:11:06.558 align:start position:0%
make their own decisions about what to
 
05:11:09.948 --> 05:11:09.958 align:start position:0%
do with an unused school and I think I
 
05:11:12.628 --> 05:11:12.638 align:start position:0%
made the point that it's a violation of
 
05:11:15.390 --> 05:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
local control to have this bill in
 
05:11:17.788 --> 05:11:17.798 align:start position:0%
effect and I urge you to vote to repeal
 
05:11:19.830 --> 05:11:19.840 align:start position:0%
it all to pass on
 
05:11:23.230 --> 05:11:23.240 align:start position:0%
719 thank you very much questions
 
05:11:25.070 --> 05:11:25.080 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald thank you Mr
 
05:11:26.390 --> 05:11:26.400 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
question representative this bill if I'm
 
05:11:31.590 --> 05:11:31.600 align:start position:0%
correct seeks to repeal RSA
 
05:11:34.708 --> 05:11:34.718 align:start position:0%
19461 which for reference is on page 631
 
05:11:36.910 --> 05:11:36.920 align:start position:0%
of our books and continues on to page
 
05:11:40.830 --> 05:11:40.840 align:start position:0%
632 and you also cited that that this
 
05:11:43.788 --> 05:11:43.798 align:start position:0%
RSA this section of law violates local
 
05:11:45.548 --> 05:11:45.558 align:start position:0%
control and doesn't give communities
 
05:11:48.510 --> 05:11:48.520 align:start position:0%
options and I miss understanding the RSA
 
05:11:52.190 --> 05:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
when it says that the school district if
 
05:11:53.910 --> 05:11:53.920 align:start position:0%
it's not used for academic purposes
 
05:11:55.110 --> 05:11:55.120 align:start position:0%
extracurricular activities
 
05:11:57.350 --> 05:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
administrative school function Sports
 
05:11:58.868 --> 05:11:58.878 align:start position:0%
and for which the school district has no
 
05:12:00.470 --> 05:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
Schoolboard approved ridding plan for
 
05:12:04.110 --> 05:12:04.120 align:start position:0%
future use that they can still use this
 
05:12:06.030 --> 05:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
for whatever they deem if it fits into
 
05:12:08.030 --> 05:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
one of those categories the last being
 
05:12:10.110 --> 05:12:10.120 align:start position:0%
more of a catch-all any approved wring
 
05:12:12.910 --> 05:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
plan so what am I misunderstanding that
 
05:12:14.910 --> 05:12:14.920 align:start position:0%
this RSA violates local control when
 
05:12:17.150 --> 05:12:17.160 align:start position:0%
there's four listed options thank you
 
05:12:19.750 --> 05:12:19.760 align:start position:0%
for the question I believe it is the the
 
05:12:21.310 --> 05:12:21.320 align:start position:0%
the part that I'm having trouble with is
 
05:12:24.150 --> 05:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
that the school the local community is
 
05:12:26.390 --> 05:12:26.400 align:start position:0%
not free to offer the buildings of just
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
anyone first refusal must go to a
 
05:12:30.270 --> 05:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
charter school if a charter school is
 
05:12:33.590 --> 05:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
interested they get first offer and then
 
05:12:36.150 --> 05:12:36.160 align:start position:0%
the uh if there are competing offers the
 
05:12:37.910 --> 05:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
commissioner elbl will step in and
 
05:12:43.628 --> 05:12:43.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:45.750 --> 05:12:45.760 align:start position:0%
correct additional questions
 
05:12:47.990 --> 05:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative Freeman thank you Mr
 
05:12:49.470 --> 05:12:49.480 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you representative for
 
05:12:52.910 --> 05:12:52.920 align:start position:0%
coming in front of us so um do you do
 
05:12:57.510 --> 05:12:57.520 align:start position:0%
you do you know how the districts um
 
05:12:59.990 --> 05:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
dispose of unwanted buildings that they
 
05:13:01.670 --> 05:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
have no further use
 
05:13:04.628 --> 05:13:04.638 align:start position:0%
for uh thank you for the question I I
 
05:13:07.910 --> 05:13:07.920 align:start position:0%
believe it is left it was at least left
 
05:13:10.628 --> 05:13:10.638 align:start position:0%
to the uh school board and with public
 
05:13:13.670 --> 05:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
with public uh input to decide whether
 
05:13:17.788 --> 05:13:17.798 align:start position:0%
it would be uh housing or some other use
 
05:13:19.948 --> 05:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
or sold to a charter school which has
 
05:13:21.510 --> 05:13:21.520 align:start position:0%
which has happened before this
 
05:13:25.590 --> 05:13:25.600 align:start position:0%
legislation was passed followup yes do
 
05:13:28.548 --> 05:13:28.558 align:start position:0%
you know how many chter schools um have
 
05:13:30.830 --> 05:13:30.840 align:start position:0%
put in office on unused school buildings
 
05:13:32.708 --> 05:13:32.718 align:start position:0%
that the community has deemed is no
 
05:13:37.110 --> 05:13:37.120 align:start position:0%
longer will fit their needs I don't know
 
05:13:39.150 --> 05:13:39.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
further questions I see none oh I'm
 
05:13:45.628 --> 05:13:45.638 align:start position:0%
sorry representative s thank thank
 
05:13:45.638 --> 05:13:47.670 align:start position:0%
sorry representative s thank thank
you

05:13:47.670 --> 05:13:47.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:13:50.548 --> 05:13:50.558 align:start position:0%
oh okay thank you sorry thank you and
 
05:13:53.788 --> 05:13:53.798 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question um I'm
 
05:13:55.708 --> 05:13:55.718 align:start position:0%
I'm glad that the other bill was not in
 
05:13:57.628 --> 05:13:57.638 align:start position:0%
place when our new Middle School was
 
05:13:59.230 --> 05:13:59.240 align:start position:0%
built in my community when we had to
 
05:14:01.590 --> 05:14:01.600 align:start position:0%
tear down the existing Middle School in
 
05:14:04.750 --> 05:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
order as we flip flop buildings but I'm
 
05:14:08.430 --> 05:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
I'm curious how the RSA around the
 
05:14:10.990 --> 05:14:11.000 align:start position:0%
unused buildings and unused space is
 
05:14:13.670 --> 05:14:13.680 align:start position:0%
impacted if if the building is as other
 
05:14:15.670 --> 05:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
schools have been deemed unsafe for
 
05:14:18.430 --> 05:14:18.440 align:start position:0%
continued use how does that impact the
 
05:14:21.510 --> 05:14:21.520 align:start position:0%
sales of or the leasing of to any entity
 
05:14:22.788 --> 05:14:22.798 align:start position:0%
if they don't want to sell it but they
 
05:14:23.990 --> 05:14:24.000 align:start position:0%
really just want to eliminate the
 
05:14:26.990 --> 05:14:27.000 align:start position:0%
building all together U let me see if I
 
05:14:28.470 --> 05:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
can answer that I'm trying to understand
 
05:14:31.430 --> 05:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
how that connects with all of
 
05:14:34.030 --> 05:14:34.040 align:start position:0%
this let me see if I can answer that I
 
05:14:37.110 --> 05:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
think if you have well the example uh in
 
05:14:38.990 --> 05:14:39.000 align:start position:0%
in Kingston was they had an unused bill
 
05:14:40.270 --> 05:14:40.280 align:start position:0%
building that was not attractive
 
05:14:42.310 --> 05:14:42.320 align:start position:0%
apparently to investors at least at that
 
05:14:46.548 --> 05:14:46.558 align:start position:0%
time uh things change right uh I'm aware
 
05:14:48.430 --> 05:14:48.440 align:start position:0%
of a school in summersworth that looks
 
05:14:50.030 --> 05:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
just like the one in New Market that
 
05:14:51.430 --> 05:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
opened in
 
05:14:54.590 --> 05:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
1925 uh that a developer repurposed into
 
05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
housing just a few years ago um so you
 
05:15:00.390 --> 05:15:00.400 align:start position:0%
know certainly an empty school is could
 
05:15:04.590 --> 05:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
be used in a variety of ways and uh I I
 
05:15:06.510 --> 05:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
think the communities generally want to
 
05:15:09.470 --> 05:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
find it the best possible purpose for it
 
05:15:13.150 --> 05:15:13.160 align:start position:0%
and it could be a charter of school or
 
05:15:16.110 --> 05:15:16.120 align:start position:0%
it may be housing or it may be it may be
 
05:15:17.590 --> 05:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
any other use but I think it should be
 
05:15:19.910 --> 05:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
left to the community they shouldn't be
 
05:15:22.628 --> 05:15:22.638 align:start position:0%
dictated to have first refusal for one
 
05:15:25.070 --> 05:15:25.080 align:start position:0%
or the
 
05:15:28.150 --> 05:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
other quick followup okay thank you very
 
05:15:30.110 --> 05:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
much so my question is more it's not
 
05:15:32.510 --> 05:15:32.520 align:start position:0%
about repurposing a building but what
 
05:15:34.628 --> 05:15:34.638 align:start position:0%
happens as a case happened in Oyster
 
05:15:36.590 --> 05:15:36.600 align:start position:0%
River where the previous Middle School
 
05:15:38.510 --> 05:15:38.520 align:start position:0%
needed to be torn down they literally
 
05:15:41.510 --> 05:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
flipped fields and the school locations
 
05:15:43.230 --> 05:15:43.240 align:start position:0%
but also because the previous building
 
05:15:47.190 --> 05:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
was no longer functional as
 
05:15:53.470 --> 05:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:56.430 --> 05:15:56.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I I think it's possible it's
 
05:15:58.510 --> 05:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
possible with in line of the other bill
 
05:16:00.868 --> 05:16:00.878 align:start position:0%
that that added made them uh made
 
05:16:02.628 --> 05:16:02.638 align:start position:0%
Charters eligible for building Aid it's
 
05:16:04.548 --> 05:16:04.558 align:start position:0%
possible that a charter school might
 
05:16:07.430 --> 05:16:07.440 align:start position:0%
apply for the building Aid and get State
 
05:16:11.390 --> 05:16:11.400 align:start position:0%
money again uh to bring the bring the
 
05:16:13.590 --> 05:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
building up to some level of safety I'm
 
05:16:14.990 --> 05:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
not sure if they have the same standards
 
05:16:17.310 --> 05:16:17.320 align:start position:0%
as the traditional Public Schools I
 
05:16:18.788 --> 05:16:18.798 align:start position:0%
would hope they
 
05:16:21.510 --> 05:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
did representative
 
05:16:24.350 --> 05:16:24.360 align:start position:0%
Murray I'm sorry yes representative dry
 
05:16:26.030 --> 05:16:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you and
 
05:16:29.270 --> 05:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so um
 
05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
the idea of a unsafe building not
 
05:16:34.868 --> 05:16:34.878 align:start position:0%
withstanding um this bill this section
 
05:16:38.070 --> 05:16:38.080 align:start position:0%
of law just took effect in 2023 given
 
05:16:39.910 --> 05:16:39.920 align:start position:0%
that Charter schools and school
 
05:16:43.750 --> 05:16:43.760 align:start position:0%
buildings don't open up every few months
 
05:16:46.708 --> 05:16:46.718 align:start position:0%
um we haven't really had time to test
 
05:16:49.910 --> 05:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
this much and given that charter schools
 
05:16:52.510 --> 05:16:52.520 align:start position:0%
are public schools doesn't it seem like
 
05:16:54.510 --> 05:16:54.520 align:start position:0%
the best place for them to start to look
 
05:16:56.750 --> 05:16:56.760 align:start position:0%
for buildings is in public buildings
 
05:16:59.150 --> 05:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
public school buildings uh thank you for
 
05:17:02.230 --> 05:17:02.240 align:start position:0%
the question I I I don't disagree that a
 
05:17:04.470 --> 05:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
school building would be probably a very
 
05:17:07.310 --> 05:17:07.320 align:start position:0%
good use for a another type of school or
 
05:17:10.830 --> 05:17:10.840 align:start position:0%
or school I my point is that I think it
 
05:17:13.270 --> 05:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
should not be an automatic first refusal
 
05:17:15.910 --> 05:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
for a charter and I know many of them
 
05:17:20.510 --> 05:17:20.520 align:start position:0%
set up in shopping malls storefronts and
 
05:17:23.390 --> 05:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
you know uh I would like to see them at
 
05:17:26.310 --> 05:17:26.320 align:start position:0%
the school myself but if if that if
 
05:17:28.150 --> 05:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
that's the will of the community that's
 
05:17:29.590 --> 05:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
I think that's
 
05:17:33.708 --> 05:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
fine R Marie thank you Mr chair and I
 
05:17:36.990 --> 05:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
guess to representative dr's Point um
 
05:17:39.948 --> 05:17:39.958 align:start position:0%
regarding there not being a whole lot of
 
05:17:42.230 --> 05:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
time that we have had around this the
 
05:17:44.788 --> 05:17:44.798 align:start position:0%
way I am interpreting this section of
 
05:17:47.590 --> 05:17:47.600 align:start position:0%
the RSA is that the district has to sort
 
05:17:50.868 --> 05:17:50.878 align:start position:0%
of fish for or look for Charter Schools
 
05:17:53.270 --> 05:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
whether through an RFP or it says
 
05:17:54.948 --> 05:17:54.958 align:start position:0%
pursuant to paragraph one a school
 
05:17:56.708 --> 05:17:56.718 align:start position:0%
district shall offer an unused facility
 
05:17:59.830 --> 05:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
to a Charter Public School and so my
 
05:18:02.788 --> 05:18:02.798 align:start position:0%
question is does that happen through an
 
05:18:05.470 --> 05:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
RFP process if a building is deemed no
 
05:18:07.390 --> 05:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
longer usable through the district or is
 
05:18:09.750 --> 05:18:09.760 align:start position:0%
that something that they're literally
 
05:18:11.350 --> 05:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
do they have a public comment period of
 
05:18:12.990 --> 05:18:13.000 align:start position:0%
time where a charter comes forward and
 
05:18:14.670 --> 05:18:14.680 align:start position:0%
says yes I'm interested and then that
 
05:18:16.430 --> 05:18:16.440 align:start position:0%
closes and if there's no interest it
 
05:18:19.750 --> 05:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
opens up to something else uh I'm I'm
 
05:18:21.548 --> 05:18:21.558 align:start position:0%
not sure because again it may not have
 
05:18:24.070 --> 05:18:24.080 align:start position:0%
really happened yet but my understanding
 
05:18:25.948 --> 05:18:25.958 align:start position:0%
is the schools are required to notify
 
05:18:25.958 --> 05:18:26.708 align:start position:0%
is the schools are required to notify
the

05:18:26.708 --> 05:18:26.718 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:18:29.470 --> 05:18:29.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner uh when they have schools
 
05:18:31.868 --> 05:18:31.878 align:start position:0%
School space that's available not not
 
05:18:34.190 --> 05:18:34.200 align:start position:0%
with not a plan for use and I imagine
 
05:18:36.150 --> 05:18:36.160 align:start position:0%
the commissioner makes that list
 
05:18:38.110 --> 05:18:38.120 align:start position:0%
available to those who want to open the
 
05:18:39.430 --> 05:18:39.440 align:start position:0%
charter school I'm not sure if he's
 
05:18:41.390 --> 05:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
reaching out to housing developers in
 
05:18:42.628 --> 05:18:42.638 align:start position:0%
the same
 
05:18:45.430 --> 05:18:45.440 align:start position:0%
email we do also have several people
 
05:18:47.230 --> 05:18:47.240 align:start position:0%
from the Department
 
05:18:50.788 --> 05:18:50.798 align:start position:0%
here great thank you I see no further
 
05:18:52.548 --> 05:18:52.558 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for
 
05:19:11.390 --> 05:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:15.230 --> 05:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
hello thank you hi um I'll begin by
 
05:19:16.830 --> 05:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
reading my statement and then I have a
 
05:19:21.150 --> 05:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
few points based on some of his comments
 
05:19:23.628 --> 05:19:23.638 align:start position:0%
um yeah could if you could just uh
 
05:19:25.670 --> 05:19:25.680 align:start position:0%

05:19:27.910 --> 05:19:27.920 align:start position:0%
that you're representing yeah um thank
 
05:19:29.390 --> 05:19:29.400 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity to provide
 
05:19:31.390 --> 05:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
testimony today my name is Jody Adams
 
05:19:32.990 --> 05:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
and I serve as the executive director
 
05:19:34.310 --> 05:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Alliance for
 
05:19:36.628 --> 05:19:36.638 align:start position:0%
public charter schools uh I'm here to
 
05:19:39.190 --> 05:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
express my opposition to HB 79
 
05:19:40.868 --> 05:19:40.878 align:start position:0%
which would repeal the right of the
 
05:19:42.910 --> 05:19:42.920 align:start position:0%
first refusal for charter schools to
 
05:19:45.788 --> 05:19:45.798 align:start position:0%
access unused districts um school
 
05:19:49.150 --> 05:19:49.160 align:start position:0%
buildings across 22 States similar first
 
05:19:51.110 --> 05:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
wrer refusal laws recognize the
 
05:19:52.590 --> 05:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
importance of making vacant or
 
05:19:54.590 --> 05:19:54.600 align:start position:0%
underutilized public school facilities
 
05:19:56.910 --> 05:19:56.920 align:start position:0%
available to public charter schools
 
05:19:58.628 --> 05:19:58.638 align:start position:0%
these policies reflect a broader
 
05:20:00.788 --> 05:20:00.798 align:start position:0%
consensus that all public school
 
05:20:02.750 --> 05:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
students should benefit from taxpayer
 
05:20:04.830 --> 05:20:04.840 align:start position:0%
funded assets regardless of whether they
 
05:20:06.868 --> 05:20:06.878 align:start position:0%
attend a traditional District school or
 
05:20:09.350 --> 05:20:09.360 align:start position:0%
public charter school the V majority of
 
05:20:10.750 --> 05:20:10.760 align:start position:0%
students attending public charter
 
05:20:12.548 --> 05:20:12.558 align:start position:0%
schools come from the very communities
 
05:20:14.030 --> 05:20:14.040 align:start position:0%
in which these schools are
 
05:20:17.230 --> 05:20:17.240 align:start position:0%
located they are local public school
 
05:20:19.628 --> 05:20:19.638 align:start position:0%
students and deserve Equity access to
 
05:20:21.310 --> 05:20:21.320 align:start position:0%
facilities that their families tax
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
dollars have helped fund denying Charter
 
05:20:25.590 --> 05:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
Schools the ability to use vacant public
 
05:20:27.150 --> 05:20:27.160 align:start position:0%
school buildings are not only
 
05:20:29.150 --> 05:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
inequitable but also undermines the
 
05:20:31.670 --> 05:20:31.680 align:start position:0%
intent of these spaces to educate our
 
05:20:33.910 --> 05:20:33.920 align:start position:0%
children furthermore when District
 
05:20:35.230 --> 05:20:35.240 align:start position:0%
school buildings sit empty or
 
05:20:37.110 --> 05:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
underutilized it represents a glaring
 
05:20:39.110 --> 05:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
inefficiency in the use of public
 
05:20:41.230 --> 05:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
resources allowing charter schools to
 
05:20:42.788 --> 05:20:42.798 align:start position:0%
use these facilities ensures the
 
05:20:44.628 --> 05:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollars are directed towards
 
05:20:46.788 --> 05:20:46.798 align:start position:0%
educating rather than allowing buildings
 
05:20:49.670 --> 05:20:49.680 align:start position:0%
to deteriorate or remain vacant this is
 
05:20:51.470 --> 05:20:51.480 align:start position:0%
fiscally responsible approach that
 
05:20:53.830 --> 05:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
maximizes the value of public assets for
 
05:20:53.840 --> 05:20:55.070 align:start position:0%
maximizes the value of public assets for
educational

05:20:55.070 --> 05:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
educational
 
05:20:57.430 --> 05:20:57.440 align:start position:0%
purposes unlike Traditional School
 
05:20:59.310 --> 05:20:59.320 align:start position:0%
District Schools Charter Schools do not
 
05:21:02.150 --> 05:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
receive direct funding for facilities
 
05:21:03.948 --> 05:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
instead they must secure and pay for
 
05:21:07.030 --> 05:21:07.040 align:start position:0%
spaces using operating budgets often at
 
05:21:09.788 --> 05:21:09.798 align:start position:0%
Market rates this significantly reduces
 
05:21:11.750 --> 05:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
the funding available for instruction
 
05:21:14.350 --> 05:21:14.360 align:start position:0%
teacher salaries and student programs
 
05:21:16.270 --> 05:21:16.280 align:start position:0%
providing access to unused District
 
05:21:18.230 --> 05:21:18.240 align:start position:0%
buildings helps level the playing field
 
05:21:20.150 --> 05:21:20.160 align:start position:0%
and ensure that Charter Schools can
 
05:21:22.390 --> 05:21:22.400 align:start position:0%
allocate more resources to their core
 
05:21:22.400 --> 05:21:25.070 align:start position:0%
allocate more resources to their core
educational

05:21:25.070 --> 05:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:28.390 --> 05:21:28.400 align:start position:0%
Mission moreover uh shared use of public
 
05:21:29.750 --> 05:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
school buildings can foster
 
05:21:31.230 --> 05:21:31.240 align:start position:0%
collaboration between Charter and
 
05:21:33.830 --> 05:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
district schools by working together in
 
05:21:35.868 --> 05:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
shared spaces both types of schools can
 
05:21:38.150 --> 05:21:38.160 align:start position:0%
exchange best practices shared resources
 
05:21:39.750 --> 05:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
and create more integrated and
 
05:21:42.628 --> 05:21:42.638 align:start position:0%
supportive public education systems this
 
05:21:44.910 --> 05:21:44.920 align:start position:0%
benefits all public school students
 
05:21:46.990 --> 05:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
regardless of which type of school they
 
05:21:49.708 --> 05:21:49.718 align:start position:0%
attend in conclusion by eliminating the
 
05:21:52.110 --> 05:21:52.120 align:start position:0%
first right of refusal it limits access
 
05:21:54.030 --> 05:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
to valuable public resources that should
 
05:21:57.190 --> 05:21:57.200 align:start position:0%
be used to support public education for
 
05:21:59.948 --> 05:21:59.958 align:start position:0%
all students and I urge you to oppose HB
 
05:22:02.190 --> 05:22:02.200 align:start position:0%
719 and continue supporting policies
 
05:22:03.830 --> 05:22:03.840 align:start position:0%
that prioritize
 
05:22:07.110 --> 05:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
students um I just a couple notes um
 
05:22:08.548 --> 05:22:08.558 align:start position:0%
just based on some of the things I heard
 
05:22:11.788 --> 05:22:11.798 align:start position:0%
heard um there is one school that has
 
05:22:14.990 --> 05:22:15.000 align:start position:0%
been able to take um advantage of this
 
05:22:16.670 --> 05:22:16.680 align:start position:0%
bill since it has been enacted and
 
05:22:19.110 --> 05:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
that's Compass classical in Northfield
 
05:22:20.830 --> 05:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
um I did discuss it with them before
 
05:22:23.830 --> 05:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
coming um they said it was a difficult
 
05:22:26.030 --> 05:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
process um but they were able to get
 
05:22:31.430 --> 05:22:31.440 align:start position:0%
through it um we do find that so far um
 
05:22:35.110 --> 05:22:35.120 align:start position:0%
we call it um sick buildings a majority
 
05:22:37.430 --> 05:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
of the time these buildings a lot of the
 
05:22:39.390 --> 05:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
towns are moving on and building
 
05:22:40.990 --> 05:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
buildings because they're not finding
 
05:22:43.310 --> 05:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
that it's um it makes sense financially
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
to renovate these buildings so we
 
05:22:47.270 --> 05:22:47.280 align:start position:0%
haven't found a lot of buildings that
 
05:22:49.590 --> 05:22:49.600 align:start position:0%
have been helpful for Charter Schools um
 
05:22:51.390 --> 05:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
but sometimes as in the compass
 
05:22:53.788 --> 05:22:53.798 align:start position:0%
classical situation they found that they
 
05:22:55.390 --> 05:22:55.400 align:start position:0%
just wanted a new school and they
 
05:22:57.590 --> 05:22:57.600 align:start position:0%
decided that U they were going to sell
 
05:23:00.590 --> 05:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
this building to that point um the
 
05:23:01.788 --> 05:23:01.798 align:start position:0%
charter schools are not getting these
 
05:23:03.830 --> 05:23:03.840 align:start position:0%
buildings for free they are actually
 
05:23:05.830 --> 05:23:05.840 align:start position:0%
purchasing the buildings so this is a
 
05:23:08.590 --> 05:23:08.600 align:start position:0%
sale a first threer refusal is just that
 
05:23:10.830 --> 05:23:10.840 align:start position:0%
that it's saying hey you're the we're
 
05:23:14.030 --> 05:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
giving you the first option to purchase
 
05:23:15.628 --> 05:23:15.638 align:start position:0%
so it's not saying that nobody can
 
05:23:17.310 --> 05:23:17.320 align:start position:0%
purchase it it's not saying that the
 
05:23:20.670 --> 05:23:20.680 align:start position:0%
town is giving up money for this school
 
05:23:22.510 --> 05:23:22.520 align:start position:0%
it's saying that they have the first
 
05:23:26.548 --> 05:23:26.558 align:start position:0%
option to purchase the building um it's
 
05:23:28.230 --> 05:23:28.240 align:start position:0%
not to say that a town doesn't have the
 
05:23:30.070 --> 05:23:30.080 align:start position:0%
option also to work with a charter
 
05:23:33.390 --> 05:23:33.400 align:start position:0%
school and say hey um because
 
05:23:36.830 --> 05:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
maybe um for example there might be a a
 
05:23:39.510 --> 05:23:39.520 align:start position:0%
charter school in Manchester where 90%
 
05:23:41.350 --> 05:23:41.360 align:start position:0%
of those students are Manchester
 
05:23:44.350 --> 05:23:44.360 align:start position:0%
students um so a Manchester might want
 
05:23:46.110 --> 05:23:46.120 align:start position:0%
to work with that charter school and say
 
05:23:47.510 --> 05:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
hey we're going to give you a discount
 
05:23:49.110 --> 05:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
on that building because most of those
 
05:23:51.948 --> 05:23:51.958 align:start position:0%
kids are Manchester kids so the
 
05:23:53.990 --> 05:23:54.000 align:start position:0%
Manchester might want to work with them
 
05:23:56.270 --> 05:23:56.280 align:start position:0%
and give them a discount on the building
 
05:23:58.548 --> 05:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
um so there might be situations that
 
05:24:00.270 --> 05:24:00.280 align:start position:0%
might occur like that and that does
 
05:24:01.910 --> 05:24:01.920 align:start position:0%
happen in other states when I talk to
 
05:24:04.310 --> 05:24:04.320 align:start position:0%
some of my other alliances that does
 
05:24:07.548 --> 05:24:07.558 align:start position:0%
happen um so that is possibility down
 
05:24:10.830 --> 05:24:10.840 align:start position:0%
the line so not to say that some towns
 
05:24:12.470 --> 05:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
might want to give a building for free
 
05:24:14.708 --> 05:24:14.718 align:start position:0%
or at a discount that's a possibility
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
and that's a negotiation that a town
 
05:24:22.350 --> 05:24:22.360 align:start position:0%
might decide to do um and then as far as
 
05:24:25.190 --> 05:24:25.200 align:start position:0%
um he gave several examples of schools
 
05:24:27.430 --> 05:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
that weren't doing so well or with some
 
05:24:30.548 --> 05:24:30.558 align:start position:0%
fraudulent activity obviously not great
 
05:24:32.670 --> 05:24:32.680 align:start position:0%
situations um but I just want to point
 
05:24:34.350 --> 05:24:34.360 align:start position:0%
out that any school that's actually
 
05:24:37.030 --> 05:24:37.040 align:start position:0%
purchasing a building those are stable
 
05:24:39.590 --> 05:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
schools that have been and um showing a
 
05:24:42.270 --> 05:24:42.280 align:start position:0%
lot of sustainability and those are the
 
05:24:43.750 --> 05:24:43.760 align:start position:0%
schools that are actually purchasing
 
05:24:45.548 --> 05:24:45.558 align:start position:0%
buildings schools that have closed
 
05:24:47.270 --> 05:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
schools that have
 
05:24:49.990 --> 05:24:50.000 align:start position:0%
shown you know fraudulent not great
 
05:24:52.150 --> 05:24:52.160 align:start position:0%
activity those schools aren't purchasing
 
05:24:55.310 --> 05:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
buildings those are the schools that are
 
05:24:59.350 --> 05:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
um leasing buildings and so the schools
 
05:25:01.190 --> 05:25:01.200 align:start position:0%
that are looking to purchase those are
 
05:25:03.750 --> 05:25:03.760 align:start position:0%
the stable schools that we're looking at
 
05:25:06.590 --> 05:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
who are looking for long-term
 
05:25:09.430 --> 05:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
stability I'm looking for questions
 
05:25:10.708 --> 05:25:10.718 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome
 
05:25:10.718 --> 05:25:11.910 align:start position:0%
thank you very much you're welcome
represent

05:25:11.910 --> 05:25:11.920 align:start position:0%
represent
 
05:25:14.110 --> 05:25:14.120 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:25:16.310 --> 05:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
for coming in front of us so would you
 
05:25:18.590 --> 05:25:18.600 align:start position:0%
say that the local communities do have
 
05:25:21.310 --> 05:25:21.320 align:start position:0%
the final word on what happens to those
 
05:25:23.708 --> 05:25:23.718 align:start position:0%
buildings I would say so yeah I mean and
 
05:25:25.670 --> 05:25:25.680 align:start position:0%
but like you said we haven't gotten too
 
05:25:28.590 --> 05:25:28.600 align:start position:0%
far into it at this point but as so far
 
05:25:32.750 --> 05:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you representative worse if
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
this bill was to somehow pass then to my
 
05:25:37.070 --> 05:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
understanding wouldn't it make it
 
05:25:39.070 --> 05:25:39.080 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult for or Charter
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
Schools to be able to find suitable
 
05:25:42.830 --> 05:25:42.840 align:start position:0%
buildings that they would be able to use
 
05:25:44.590 --> 05:25:44.600 align:start position:0%
as schools instead of sitting in malls
 
05:25:44.600 --> 05:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
as schools instead of sitting in malls
or

05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
or
 
05:25:48.948 --> 05:25:48.958 align:start position:0%
shops um it is currently difficult now
 
05:25:51.110 --> 05:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
um and it is still even with this bill
 
05:25:54.510 --> 05:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
it is difficult um and like I said you
 
05:25:56.990 --> 05:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
know a lot of the buildings are already
 
05:25:59.868 --> 05:25:59.878 align:start position:0%
deemed to be not usable before they move
 
05:26:02.150 --> 05:26:02.160 align:start position:0%
on um the
 
05:26:05.030 --> 05:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
towns it depends what the towns decide
 
05:26:06.470 --> 05:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
of why they're moving on to other
 
05:26:07.830 --> 05:26:07.840 align:start position:0%
buildings and why they're leaving these
 
05:26:07.840 --> 05:26:08.830 align:start position:0%
buildings and why they're leaving these
buildings

05:26:08.830 --> 05:26:08.840 align:start position:0%
buildings
 
05:26:11.430 --> 05:26:11.440 align:start position:0%
vacant um if they're choosing to leave
 
05:26:14.110 --> 05:26:14.120 align:start position:0%
them vacant because they're not um
 
05:26:16.868 --> 05:26:16.878 align:start position:0%
feasible to maintain financially then
 
05:26:18.430 --> 05:26:18.440 align:start position:0%
it's definitely not going to work for a
 
05:26:19.910 --> 05:26:19.920 align:start position:0%
charter school because they don't have
 
05:26:21.548 --> 05:26:21.558 align:start position:0%
enough funds but if it's because they're
 
05:26:23.350 --> 05:26:23.360 align:start position:0%
moving on for another reason and it's
 
05:26:25.708 --> 05:26:25.718 align:start position:0%
financially feasible then that's great
 
05:26:28.430 --> 05:26:28.440 align:start position:0%
um time will tell if this bill is going
 
05:26:30.590 --> 05:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
to work for our Charter Schools but we
 
05:26:33.510 --> 05:26:33.520 align:start position:0%
won't know unless we leave it on the
 
05:26:36.628 --> 05:26:36.638 align:start position:0%
books thank you represent Murray um
 
05:26:38.548 --> 05:26:38.558 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thanks for maybe this
 
05:26:40.350 --> 05:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
isn't a question for you it might be for
 
05:26:42.510 --> 05:26:42.520 align:start position:0%
um the department is there a world in
 
05:26:44.868 --> 05:26:44.878 align:start position:0%
which a district a public school
 
05:26:48.750 --> 05:26:48.760 align:start position:0%
district leases their land from the town
 
05:26:52.590 --> 05:26:52.600 align:start position:0%
and by any sort of set of circumstances
 
05:26:54.830 --> 05:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
offering the building then as a first
 
05:26:57.510 --> 05:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
right of refusal would also sort of cut
 
05:27:01.788 --> 05:27:01.798 align:start position:0%
out the town's agency in the
 
05:27:05.670 --> 05:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
process so the land itself
 
05:27:08.350 --> 05:27:08.360 align:start position:0%
right yeah I I don't know how it I don't
 
05:27:10.310 --> 05:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
know why a Char would on to get involved
 
05:27:14.230 --> 05:27:14.240 align:start position:0%
with lease like leasing the land no I'm
 
05:27:16.030 --> 05:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
not sure if I'm understand follow up
 
05:27:19.948 --> 05:27:19.958 align:start position:0%
thank you my question is a district who
 
05:27:22.590 --> 05:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
has an established school perhaps might
 
05:27:24.788 --> 05:27:24.798 align:start position:0%
lease the town might lease the building
 
05:27:26.948 --> 05:27:26.958 align:start position:0%
from the town it would already exist
 
05:27:29.110 --> 05:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
there so is there any world in which
 
05:27:30.910 --> 05:27:30.920 align:start position:0%
that occurs where then we would have to
 
05:27:30.920 --> 05:27:33.310 align:start position:0%
that occurs where then we would have to
be

05:27:33.310 --> 05:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:35.470 --> 05:27:35.480 align:start position:0%
offering you want a charter school to
 
05:27:37.670 --> 05:27:37.680 align:start position:0%
lease the building from the town what I
 
05:27:41.190 --> 05:27:41.200 align:start position:0%
am asking is does that have an impact to
 
05:27:43.708 --> 05:27:43.718 align:start position:0%
how this piece of legislation is written
 
05:27:47.030 --> 05:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
if the land is as a district the land is
 
05:27:49.510 --> 05:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
leased oh from the
 
05:27:51.510 --> 05:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
town that might be a better question for
 
05:27:53.070 --> 05:27:53.080 align:start position:0%
the Department yeah that might not be
 
05:27:53.680 --> 05:27:53.690 align:start position:0%
good question for
 
05:27:53.690 --> 05:27:55.110 align:start position:0%
good question for
[Laughter]

05:27:55.110 --> 05:27:55.120 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:27:58.910 --> 05:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
me anything represent
 
05:28:01.708 --> 05:28:01.718 align:start position:0%
Woodcock thank you for coming two
 
05:28:03.708 --> 05:28:03.718 align:start position:0%
questions some point I thought you said
 
05:28:05.390 --> 05:28:05.400 align:start position:0%
I may be wrong I thought you said that
 
05:28:07.430 --> 05:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
there there's no funding for this
 
05:28:09.868 --> 05:28:09.878 align:start position:0%
through currently does the charter
 
05:28:12.788 --> 05:28:12.798 align:start position:0%
schools have a right to a $50,000 a year
 
05:28:16.310 --> 05:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
either rental or lease or
 
05:28:18.670 --> 05:28:18.680 align:start position:0%
payment there is lease
 
05:28:23.110 --> 05:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
Aid no up to 50,000 a year off hand I I
 
05:28:24.990 --> 05:28:25.000 align:start position:0%
don't know the numbers off I thought I
 
05:28:26.470 --> 05:28:26.480 align:start position:0%
said you thought I thought I heard you
 
05:28:27.948 --> 05:28:27.958 align:start position:0%
said they didn't and not everybody
 
05:28:31.788 --> 05:28:31.798 align:start position:0%
qualifies for it either follow sh yes
 
05:28:34.670 --> 05:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
thanks the second part was um is your
 
05:28:37.110 --> 05:28:37.120 align:start position:0%
interpretation the same as the
 
05:28:39.548 --> 05:28:39.558 align:start position:0%
representative presentative bill or
 
05:28:41.910 --> 05:28:41.920 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald's in terms of
 
05:28:44.430 --> 05:28:44.440 align:start position:0%
who has first lease
 
05:28:46.430 --> 05:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
option the representative was saying the
 
05:28:48.470 --> 05:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
child of schools has first least option
 
05:28:50.390 --> 05:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
on unused Public School building I think
 
05:28:52.270 --> 05:28:52.280 align:start position:0%
representative McDonald is inferring
 
05:28:54.910 --> 05:28:54.920 align:start position:0%
that they really don't so from being the
 
05:28:57.070 --> 05:28:57.080 align:start position:0%
alliance what's your position no I
 
05:28:59.230 --> 05:28:59.240 align:start position:0%
believe what she was reading is that the
 
05:29:02.990 --> 05:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
town H owns the building and they can
 
05:29:05.430 --> 05:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
try to use it in any way they wish and
 
05:29:07.708 --> 05:29:07.718 align:start position:0%
if they deem that they can't use it then
 
05:29:10.628 --> 05:29:10.638 align:start position:0%
the before they decide to sell it then
 
05:29:13.230 --> 05:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
the charter school has first RIT refusal
 
05:29:15.030 --> 05:29:15.040 align:start position:0%
so if the town decides they want to use
 
05:29:16.990 --> 05:29:17.000 align:start position:0%
it for some other purpose they can
 
05:29:18.510 --> 05:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
because they own the building but if
 
05:29:20.070 --> 05:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
they decide they're going to sell it
 
05:29:21.670 --> 05:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
then they have to ask a charter school
 
05:29:24.110 --> 05:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
first thank you that's how I interpret
 
05:29:27.830 --> 05:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
wait till the department thank
 
05:29:31.350 --> 05:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
you it any further questions for Miss
 
05:29:33.470 --> 05:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
Adams see none thank you very much for
 
05:29:35.548 --> 05:29:35.558 align:start position:0%
being here today thank you and we'll
 
05:29:38.230 --> 05:29:38.240 align:start position:0%
call uh the department up um as there
 
05:29:40.030 --> 05:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
seems to be a few questions maybe the
 
05:29:42.510 --> 05:29:42.520 align:start position:0%
department could answer um I'm not sure
 
05:29:46.240 --> 05:29:46.250 align:start position:0%
if uh two three four five want to come
 
05:29:46.250 --> 05:29:51.430 align:start position:0%
if uh two three four five want to come
[Music]

05:29:51.430 --> 05:29:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:59.750 --> 05:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:02.510 --> 05:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
the so conveniently all three of us are
 
05:30:04.590 --> 05:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
here um so because I think you're
 
05:30:06.070 --> 05:30:06.080 align:start position:0%
touching on a lot of different subjects
 
05:30:07.190 --> 05:30:07.200 align:start position:0%
and a lot of different topics
 
05:30:08.510 --> 05:30:08.520 align:start position:0%
specifically around charter schools and
 
05:30:11.150 --> 05:30:11.160 align:start position:0%
charter school facilities um a lot of
 
05:30:12.830 --> 05:30:12.840 align:start position:0%
the things that you've asked questions
 
05:30:15.110 --> 05:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
about today the department may not have
 
05:30:16.470 --> 05:30:16.480 align:start position:0%
answers to because there are not
 
05:30:18.110 --> 05:30:18.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily areas that we've dealt with
 
05:30:20.548 --> 05:30:20.558 align:start position:0%
in the past um please remember that the
 
05:30:22.470 --> 05:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
right of first refusal law is relatively
 
05:30:24.788 --> 05:30:24.798 align:start position:0%
new we've had one school that's accessed
 
05:30:27.190 --> 05:30:27.200 align:start position:0%
it and the department was um not really
 
05:30:31.788 --> 05:30:31.798 align:start position:0%
involved in that process um as as um jod
 
05:30:34.070 --> 05:30:34.080 align:start position:0%
Adam said before it was a process that
 
05:30:36.030 --> 05:30:36.040 align:start position:0%
it was not necessarily easy but it did
 
05:30:38.628 --> 05:30:38.638 align:start position:0%
end up working in the in the long run
 
05:30:40.548 --> 05:30:40.558 align:start position:0%
um but all of these concepts are
 
05:30:43.150 --> 05:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
relatively new um new legislation and so
 
05:30:44.628 --> 05:30:44.638 align:start position:0%
the department has had either very
 
05:30:48.310 --> 05:30:48.320 align:start position:0%
little role or very minimal um number of
 
05:30:52.788 --> 05:30:52.798 align:start position:0%
opportunities to implement them so um I
 
05:30:55.430 --> 05:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
guess with that um I don't we don't have
 
05:30:58.510 --> 05:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
anything necessarily prepared or planned
 
05:31:00.350 --> 05:31:00.360 align:start position:0%
to actually testify relev to this mostly
 
05:31:01.670 --> 05:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
we're just here to take questions and
 
05:31:04.510 --> 05:31:04.520 align:start position:0%
provide technical support okay I
 
05:31:08.310 --> 05:31:08.320 align:start position:0%
actually have a question first um are
 
05:31:10.670 --> 05:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
there funds available if there's a
 
05:31:12.750 --> 05:31:12.760 align:start position:0%
building that's sick and a and a charter
 
05:31:15.590 --> 05:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
school wants to purchase that are there
 
05:31:20.750 --> 05:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
funds available for fixing it up so um a
 
05:31:23.110 --> 05:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
kind of a couple different Avenues there
 
05:31:27.310 --> 05:31:27.320 align:start position:0%
so Charter Schools um if they are a new
 
05:31:30.270 --> 05:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
charter school and they have um they
 
05:31:31.548 --> 05:31:31.558 align:start position:0%
would have to have already purchased the
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
building if they new charter school and
 
05:31:34.310 --> 05:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
they would receive a federal Charter
 
05:31:37.150 --> 05:31:37.160 align:start position:0%
School startup Grant they could use some
 
05:31:40.350 --> 05:31:40.360 align:start position:0%
funds as long as is to deal with safety
 
05:31:42.230 --> 05:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
requirements required by the state to
 
05:31:44.750 --> 05:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
open um if it were an existing Charter
 
05:31:47.430 --> 05:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
School charter schools are able to apply
 
05:31:50.270 --> 05:31:50.280 align:start position:0%
for State Building Aid which is money
 
05:31:53.150 --> 05:31:53.160 align:start position:0%
available to renovate school facilities
 
05:31:55.150 --> 05:31:55.160 align:start position:0%
that again is new I think it passed last
 
05:31:58.470 --> 05:31:58.480 align:start position:0%
year allowing schools to um access that
 
05:32:02.150 --> 05:32:02.160 align:start position:0%
um and so the first year that charter
 
05:32:03.868 --> 05:32:03.878 align:start position:0%
schools are able to submit building Aid
 
05:32:05.948 --> 05:32:05.958 align:start position:0%
applications are this year there would
 
05:32:07.990 --> 05:32:08.000 align:start position:0%
be due by April 1st we don't know if
 
05:32:08.990 --> 05:32:09.000 align:start position:0%
Charter Schools will submit an
 
05:32:10.788 --> 05:32:10.798 align:start position:0%
application once the charter school
 
05:32:12.750 --> 05:32:12.760 align:start position:0%
submits an application it go it's the
 
05:32:14.230 --> 05:32:14.240 align:start position:0%
application is ranked and placed on a
 
05:32:16.430 --> 05:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
list and is building aid funds are made
 
05:32:18.350 --> 05:32:18.360 align:start position:0%
available the Department of Education
 
05:32:21.390 --> 05:32:21.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:24.350 --> 05:32:24.360 align:start position:0%
funds representa Murray thank you madam
 
05:32:25.708 --> 05:32:25.718 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
05:32:27.628 --> 05:32:27.638 align:start position:0%
question the initial question I had
 
05:32:30.628 --> 05:32:30.638 align:start position:0%
asked I think the prime sponsor or maybe
 
05:32:32.788 --> 05:32:32.798 align:start position:0%
it was um was
 
05:32:35.110 --> 05:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
around the list that is housed on the
 
05:32:37.030 --> 05:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
department's website of available
 
05:32:39.070 --> 05:32:39.080 align:start position:0%
buildings potentially that's how I'm
 
05:32:41.270 --> 05:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
interpreting this
 
05:32:43.910 --> 05:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
um does the district have any onus or
 
05:32:45.788 --> 05:32:45.798 align:start position:0%
responsibility to reach out to Charter
 
05:32:47.990 --> 05:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
Schools and say hey this is available
 
05:32:49.430 --> 05:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
and how long does that window have to
 
05:32:50.670 --> 05:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
stay I believe that's actually the
 
05:32:51.948 --> 05:32:51.958 align:start position:0%
purpose of that list and why the
 
05:32:53.230 --> 05:32:53.240 align:start position:0%
legislature wanted the department to
 
05:32:54.670 --> 05:32:54.680 align:start position:0%
collect that information so Charter
 
05:32:56.830 --> 05:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
Schools could access easily access that
 
05:32:59.510 --> 05:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
information Statewide so when you all
 
05:33:01.470 --> 05:33:01.480 align:start position:0%
require the department to do the unused
 
05:33:04.788 --> 05:33:04.798 align:start position:0%
facility surve survey um and publish it
 
05:33:06.430 --> 05:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
on our website that is now a resource
 
05:33:08.230 --> 05:33:08.240 align:start position:0%
available to Charter Schools to see what
 
05:33:10.628 --> 05:33:10.638 align:start position:0%
may be out there for inventory follow up
 
05:33:13.750 --> 05:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
follow up and how long does
 
05:33:16.830 --> 05:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
that opportunity have to State on the
 
05:33:18.628 --> 05:33:18.638 align:start position:0%
department's website but let's say that
 
05:33:20.708 --> 05:33:20.718 align:start position:0%
building sits on there for a year two
 
05:33:23.230 --> 05:33:23.240 align:start position:0%
years and nobody comes forward and says
 
05:33:25.510 --> 05:33:25.520 align:start position:0%
hey I have an interest in this at what
 
05:33:28.230 --> 05:33:28.240 align:start position:0%
point can a a town or a district move
 
05:33:31.150 --> 05:33:31.160 align:start position:0%
forward with trying to so I I the list
 
05:33:34.150 --> 05:33:34.160 align:start position:0%
is a point in time collection um we
 
05:33:36.070 --> 05:33:36.080 align:start position:0%
collect I think every other it's the
 
05:33:37.830 --> 05:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
it's every other year it is every year
 
05:33:39.948 --> 05:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
every year July yeah we post it in July
 
05:33:43.910 --> 05:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
of each year um and so um the a so right
 
05:33:45.628 --> 05:33:45.638 align:start position:0%
now it's February that list could be age
 
05:33:48.430 --> 05:33:48.440 align:start position:0%
and schools could have moved on you know
 
05:33:50.190 --> 05:33:50.200 align:start position:0%
selling a facility there's no
 
05:33:52.390 --> 05:33:52.400 align:start position:0%
requirement for them to hold on to a
 
05:33:54.628 --> 05:33:54.638 align:start position:0%
facility for a period of
 
05:33:57.868 --> 05:33:57.878 align:start position:0%
time representative wock thank you m
 
05:34:00.628 --> 05:34:00.638 align:start position:0%
chair good afternoon once again um just
 
05:34:02.030 --> 05:34:02.040 align:start position:0%
go back I'm trying to I'm trying to get
 
05:34:04.030 --> 05:34:04.040 align:start position:0%
the accurate
 
05:34:09.670 --> 05:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
interpretation of this regulation um
 
05:34:13.030 --> 05:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
as is it the Department's position and I
 
05:34:14.430 --> 05:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
read it several times is the
 
05:34:19.070 --> 05:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
Department's position that the first non
 
05:34:23.190 --> 05:34:23.200 align:start position:0%
School use of that building unused
 
05:34:26.350 --> 05:34:26.360 align:start position:0%
building then becomes the first option
 
05:34:30.510 --> 05:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
for the um child school or is it the
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
position that the um the public can the
 
05:34:38.150 --> 05:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
local school board can can use for
 
05:34:40.868 --> 05:34:40.878 align:start position:0%
anything before the school TR the school
 
05:34:42.470 --> 05:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
um I think we'll have to get back to you
 
05:34:44.390 --> 05:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
on that question would you mind emailing
 
05:34:47.990 --> 05:34:48.000 align:start position:0%
that more specifically so we can work
 
05:34:50.868 --> 05:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
technology you can ask Jen to email it
 
05:34:53.948 --> 05:34:53.958 align:start position:0%
to us surely I think we really need to
 
05:34:56.030 --> 05:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
work with our attorney to clarify that
 
05:34:58.628 --> 05:34:58.638 align:start position:0%
so I mean that may thank you that I mean
 
05:35:01.390 --> 05:35:01.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's the essence of where where
 
05:35:03.990 --> 05:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
the where the public school loses or I
 
05:35:05.470 --> 05:35:05.480 align:start position:0%
think the represent of local control
 
05:35:06.788 --> 05:35:06.798 align:start position:0%
where the public school loses that
 
05:35:08.510 --> 05:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
authority to control the use of that
 
05:35:10.868 --> 05:35:10.878 align:start position:0%
building so if the first option is
 
05:35:12.830 --> 05:35:12.840 align:start position:0%
clearly after the public school done
 
05:35:15.070 --> 05:35:15.080 align:start position:0%
with it then it goes to the Charter
 
05:35:18.150 --> 05:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
School window that's one or no it
 
05:35:19.510 --> 05:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
doesn't go to child window goes to
 
05:35:21.510 --> 05:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
wherever they want it to go that's I
 
05:35:22.510 --> 05:35:22.520 align:start position:0%
guess that's the question we're trying
 
05:35:24.788 --> 05:35:24.798 align:start position:0%
to I'm trying to get so I think
 
05:35:26.628 --> 05:35:26.638 align:start position:0%
typically wrer first refusal is relative
 
05:35:28.470 --> 05:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
the school can list it for sale and when
 
05:35:30.548 --> 05:35:30.558 align:start position:0%
they have offers the first refusal the
 
05:35:32.110 --> 05:35:32.120 align:start position:0%
charter school they have to offer it to
 
05:35:34.270 --> 05:35:34.280 align:start position:0%
the charter school first assuming that
 
05:35:37.708 --> 05:35:37.718 align:start position:0%
the offer is of the appropriate cost um
 
05:35:38.868 --> 05:35:38.878 align:start position:0%
and then the charter school has the
 
05:35:40.350 --> 05:35:40.360 align:start position:0%
first right to refuse it and then it
 
05:35:42.230 --> 05:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
goes to potentially other offers that
 
05:35:44.070 --> 05:35:44.080 align:start position:0%
they would have on that property but I
 
05:35:45.670 --> 05:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
believe the school can still list the
 
05:35:48.230 --> 05:35:48.240 align:start position:0%
property for sale but the child of
 
05:35:50.830 --> 05:35:50.840 align:start position:0%
school the charter school has the right
 
05:35:52.110 --> 05:35:52.120 align:start position:0%
if they if they meet the appropriate
 
05:35:55.910 --> 05:35:55.920 align:start position:0%
cost as First Option yes okay perfect
 
05:35:58.708 --> 05:35:58.718 align:start position:0%
thank you representative celik thank you
 
05:36:00.510 --> 05:36:00.520 align:start position:0%
and thank you for taking my question I I
 
05:36:02.350 --> 05:36:02.360 align:start position:0%
saw you cut looking at each other when I
 
05:36:04.430 --> 05:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
asked my question earlier but so I'm
 
05:36:06.830 --> 05:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand if a building
 
05:36:08.430 --> 05:36:08.440 align:start position:0%
such as the pre oyster ofer Middle
 
05:36:11.230 --> 05:36:11.240 align:start position:0%
School is truly deemed as not usable and
 
05:36:13.070 --> 05:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
they need to take down the building so
 
05:36:14.628 --> 05:36:14.638 align:start position:0%
it's not that they're looking for a new
 
05:36:17.788 --> 05:36:17.798 align:start position:0%
use would that is that impacted by this
 
05:36:19.910 --> 05:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
law because they're not trying to reuse
 
05:36:21.510 --> 05:36:21.520 align:start position:0%
the building they're just trying to rid
 
05:36:22.948 --> 05:36:22.958 align:start position:0%
themselves of yeah I see they're not
 
05:36:25.390 --> 05:36:25.400 align:start position:0%
selling it so this is right of person on
 
05:36:28.310 --> 05:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
only related to salties for sales yes I
 
05:36:31.310 --> 05:36:31.320 align:start position:0%
or or lease yes so in charter schools
 
05:36:33.628 --> 05:36:33.638 align:start position:0%
have to follow facility standards as
 
05:36:36.590 --> 05:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
well so then maybe that so we do the
 
05:36:38.910 --> 05:36:38.920 align:start position:0%
similar to the um facility inspection
 
05:36:40.548 --> 05:36:40.558 align:start position:0%
program that we have with District
 
05:36:41.868 --> 05:36:41.878 align:start position:0%
Public Schools we have a similar
 
05:36:44.990 --> 05:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
facility inspection um requirement for
 
05:36:46.910 --> 05:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
charter schools so if something is
 
05:36:48.948 --> 05:36:48.958 align:start position:0%
unusable by a public school it's also
 
05:36:51.110 --> 05:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
likely unusable by a charter school
 
05:36:53.548 --> 05:36:53.558 align:start position:0%
without substantial Renovations and so I
 
05:36:55.708 --> 05:36:55.718 align:start position:0%
mean there are times that Charter School
 
05:36:56.750 --> 05:36:56.760 align:start position:0%
a charter school potentially could
 
05:36:57.750 --> 05:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
purchase something but then they would
 
05:37:00.230 --> 05:37:00.240 align:start position:0%
be responsible for the renovations which
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
then that they would have to apply for
 
05:37:03.548 --> 05:37:03.558 align:start position:0%
building Aid if they didn't have private
 
05:37:06.990 --> 05:37:07.000 align:start position:0%
financing for that representative McDon
 
05:37:08.750 --> 05:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you once
 
05:37:11.150 --> 05:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
again I think I have the same sort of
 
05:37:12.628 --> 05:37:12.638 align:start position:0%
question and we seem to be interpreting
 
05:37:13.830 --> 05:37:13.840 align:start position:0%
this a little bit differently so my
 
05:37:15.030 --> 05:37:15.040 align:start position:0%
clarification is how would the
 
05:37:18.310 --> 05:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
department interpret this where it says
 
05:37:20.830 --> 05:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
um which the school district has no
 
05:37:22.628 --> 05:37:22.638 align:start position:0%
school board approved ridden plan for
 
05:37:25.270 --> 05:37:25.280 align:start position:0%
future use so couldn't theoretically the
 
05:37:26.910 --> 05:37:26.920 align:start position:0%
school board say that they wanted to use
 
05:37:28.788 --> 05:37:28.798 align:start position:0%
a building for housing or something else
 
05:37:30.150 --> 05:37:30.160 align:start position:0%
and if the school board were to vote on
 
05:37:32.310 --> 05:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
that does that count as a approved ring
 
05:37:34.030 --> 05:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
plan and they could use it for something
 
05:37:35.430 --> 05:37:35.440 align:start position:0%
else I I think that's something we' have
 
05:37:37.948 --> 05:37:37.958 align:start position:0%
to clarify at the department um and
 
05:37:39.910 --> 05:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to add Clarity to the law
 
05:37:42.548 --> 05:37:42.558 align:start position:0%
you could do that as well okay thank you
 
05:37:44.310 --> 05:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
05:37:46.910 --> 05:37:46.920 align:start position:0%
chair I I think um my question also is
 
05:37:49.030 --> 05:37:49.040 align:start position:0%
around whether or not so let's say is
 
05:37:50.750 --> 05:37:50.760 align:start position:0%
there a world I guess I'm asking you all
 
05:37:52.470 --> 05:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
because you have that data where a
 
05:37:54.750 --> 05:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
district leases the land and building
 
05:37:57.750 --> 05:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
from a town and if a public school
 
05:37:59.708 --> 05:37:59.718 align:start position:0%
district and so in the event that they
 
05:38:01.990 --> 05:38:02.000 align:start position:0%
are done with the building or moving on
 
05:38:06.270 --> 05:38:06.280 align:start position:0%
if that goes back to the town would that
 
05:38:08.628 --> 05:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
somehow be in violation of this or would
 
05:38:10.390 --> 05:38:10.400 align:start position:0%
that usurp the rights of the town to be
 
05:38:12.868 --> 05:38:12.878 align:start position:0%
able to take their so I mean leases and
 
05:38:15.190 --> 05:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
purchases are are separate items and so
 
05:38:17.110 --> 05:38:17.120 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that they would impact
 
05:38:19.150 --> 05:38:19.160 align:start position:0%
each other um and we have had Charter
 
05:38:23.030 --> 05:38:23.040 align:start position:0%
Schools lease facilities from towns or
 
05:38:26.150 --> 05:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
school districts before in the past so
 
05:38:29.670 --> 05:38:29.680 align:start position:0%
follow if I sure so then would it be the
 
05:38:32.110 --> 05:38:32.120 align:start position:0%
charter school reaching out to the town
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
if the public school district lease
 
05:38:39.350 --> 05:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
expired and the town kept it
 
05:38:41.468 --> 05:38:41.478 align:start position:0%
I think I'm confused by what trying ask
 
05:38:42.990 --> 05:38:43.000 align:start position:0%
I guess what what I am asking is is
 
05:38:45.468 --> 05:38:45.478 align:start position:0%
there a world in which a district
 
05:38:48.590 --> 05:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
separate from the actual town is leasing
 
05:38:50.510 --> 05:38:50.520 align:start position:0%
the physical land that the building is
 
05:38:54.030 --> 05:38:54.040 align:start position:0%
oh okay I see yeah so I don't think that
 
05:38:57.468 --> 05:38:57.478 align:start position:0%
it would impact this no I think it has
 
05:38:59.430 --> 05:38:59.440 align:start position:0%
to be owned by the district to be
 
05:39:02.590 --> 05:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
impacted by this thank you any other
 
05:39:07.868 --> 05:39:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:10.230 --> 05:39:10.240 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll close the hearing on
 
05:39:10.240 --> 05:39:23.350 align:start position:0%
and with that we'll close the hearing on
HB

05:39:23.350 --> 05:39:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:27.030 --> 05:39:27.040 align:start position:0%

05:39:36.320 --> 05:40:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
okay

05:40:06.310 --> 05:40:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:06.320 --> 05:40:36.230 align:start position:0%

05:41:36.150 --> 05:41:36.160 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to open the hearing on
 
05:41:38.110 --> 05:41:38.120 align:start position:0%

05:42:46.190 --> 05:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
non-public schools or education service
 
05:42:48.430 --> 05:42:48.440 align:start position:0%

employees and volunteers um the first
 
05:42:55.270 --> 05:42:55.280 align:start position:0%
thing I want to say about this bill
 
05:42:57.270 --> 05:42:57.280 align:start position:0%
because we've you know it's a little bit
 
05:43:00.110 --> 05:43:00.120 align:start position:0%
of a of a groundhog day this we've seen
 
05:43:05.708 --> 05:43:05.718 align:start position:0%
this bill in here before and um um in uh
 
05:43:07.270 --> 05:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
in the House Education committee we've
 
05:43:11.190 --> 05:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
seen it before and uh and this bill as
 
05:43:15.468 --> 05:43:15.478 align:start position:0%
uh as produced had the S had the same um
 
05:43:18.990 --> 05:43:19.000 align:start position:0%
bug in it that uh that earlier versions
 
05:43:22.430 --> 05:43:22.440 align:start position:0%
of this of this had so I passed a an
 
05:43:25.150 --> 05:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
amendment out um just now and there's
 
05:43:27.468 --> 05:43:27.478 align:start position:0%
extra copies right here on the on the
 
05:43:31.110 --> 05:43:31.120 align:start position:0%
corner um and I worked with um with um
 
05:43:35.030 --> 05:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
Amanda Weeden uh of the of you know who
 
05:43:37.708 --> 05:43:37.718 align:start position:0%
who's a home education advocate on the
 
05:43:41.628 --> 05:43:41.638 align:start position:0%
language in this and and the there is no
 
05:43:45.030 --> 05:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
intention of this of this bill to put
 
05:43:49.468 --> 05:43:49.478 align:start position:0%
any requirements on um on uh inhome
 
05:43:52.990 --> 05:43:53.000 align:start position:0%
education you know parents and and uh
 
05:43:57.990 --> 05:43:58.000 align:start position:0%
and and people like like that and and um
 
05:44:01.948 --> 05:44:01.958 align:start position:0%
uh it is it is strictly about about
 
05:44:05.510 --> 05:44:05.520 align:start position:0%
providing or requiring um criminal
 
05:44:08.390 --> 05:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
background criminal history back checks
 
05:44:11.390 --> 05:44:11.400 align:start position:0%
for um for people that are either
 
05:44:12.948 --> 05:44:12.958 align:start position:0%
contracted by the Department of
 
05:44:16.468 --> 05:44:16.478 align:start position:0%
Education or are employed as uh service
 
05:44:18.948 --> 05:44:18.958 align:start position:0%
providers um or employed with service
 
05:44:23.030 --> 05:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
providers or with um with non-public um
 
05:44:28.910 --> 05:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
um uh schools and U and you know and I I
 
05:44:30.708 --> 05:44:30.718 align:start position:0%
I don't really want to have to get into
 
05:44:32.750 --> 05:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
all the reasons why criminal background
 
05:44:34.590 --> 05:44:34.600 align:start position:0%
checks are so important I think a lot of
 
05:44:37.070 --> 05:44:37.080 align:start position:0%
us have heard that before but um you
 
05:44:38.830 --> 05:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
know for anybody that served on a school
 
05:44:40.628 --> 05:44:40.638 align:start position:0%
board and I think there's probably
 
05:44:42.910 --> 05:44:42.920 align:start position:0%
several of us um in the room today have
 
05:44:44.990 --> 05:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
done that you know the health Safety and
 
05:44:47.750 --> 05:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
Security of of our of our students of
 
05:44:51.230 --> 05:44:51.240 align:start position:0%
our kids is the most important thing and
 
05:44:53.070 --> 05:44:53.080 align:start position:0%
um and you know and it's heartbreaking
 
05:44:54.868 --> 05:44:54.878 align:start position:0%
when we hear stories like we're in the
 
05:44:56.910 --> 05:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
news today here even in here in New
 
05:44:59.948 --> 05:44:59.958 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about um about events that
 
05:45:04.150 --> 05:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
happen and um and and you know obviously
 
05:45:07.030 --> 05:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
you don't know what quite is happening
 
05:45:09.150 --> 05:45:09.160 align:start position:0%
when when you have to lock down a school
 
05:45:12.190 --> 05:45:12.200 align:start position:0%
or go into a code red or or or whatever
 
05:45:14.548 --> 05:45:14.558 align:start position:0%
it is but uh but you sure as hope it's
 
05:45:16.430 --> 05:45:16.440 align:start position:0%
not going to be something that's going
 
05:45:16.440 --> 05:45:17.270 align:start position:0%
not going to be something that's going
to

05:45:17.270 --> 05:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:45:19.468 --> 05:45:19.478 align:start position:0%
jeopardize the health and safety and
 
05:45:22.430 --> 05:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
security of um of you know our most
 
05:45:25.590 --> 05:45:25.600 align:start position:0%
precious cargo so um so that's the
 
05:45:28.350 --> 05:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
intention of uh of this bill is to
 
05:45:31.030 --> 05:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
require criminal background checks who
 
05:45:35.390 --> 05:45:35.400 align:start position:0%
for for um for employees and volunteers
 
05:45:38.590 --> 05:45:38.600 align:start position:0%
who are working directly with students
 
05:45:41.910 --> 05:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
in person not not you know not not
 
05:45:45.350 --> 05:45:45.360 align:start position:0%
remotely not U not not by selling
 
05:45:47.110 --> 05:45:47.120 align:start position:0%
materials or anything like that but are
 
05:45:49.590 --> 05:45:49.600 align:start position:0%
providing in-person instruction to
 
05:45:51.868 --> 05:45:51.878 align:start position:0%
students and I'd like to just sort of go
 
05:45:54.948 --> 05:45:54.958 align:start position:0%
through the bill and um and talk quickly
 
05:45:57.110 --> 05:45:57.120 align:start position:0%
about the amendment when we when we get
 
05:45:59.948 --> 05:45:59.958 align:start position:0%
to uh that that part but but there's
 
05:46:02.070 --> 05:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
basically I there's
 
05:46:04.590 --> 05:46:04.600 align:start position:0%
five six sections to it but there's
 
05:46:07.230 --> 05:46:07.240 align:start position:0%
really four parts to the bill and I'll
 
05:46:09.310 --> 05:46:09.320 align:start position:0%
just I'll just run through it very
 
05:46:12.390 --> 05:46:12.400 align:start position:0%
quickly um the the first part begins in
 
05:46:14.590 --> 05:46:14.600 align:start position:0%
section one and it's basically talking
 
05:46:16.948 --> 05:46:16.958 align:start position:0%
about how criminal background checks
 
05:46:19.590 --> 05:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
this is a new section would U would be
 
05:46:22.548 --> 05:46:22.558 align:start position:0%
required for any employee or volunteer
 
05:46:25.110 --> 05:46:25.120 align:start position:0%
of an entity contracted for Educational
 
05:46:27.548 --> 05:46:27.558 align:start position:0%
Services by the department but so by the
 
05:46:29.468 --> 05:46:29.478 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Department of Education or
 
05:46:32.430 --> 05:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
by the state board so these are um these
 
05:46:34.910 --> 05:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
are um you know people who are working
 
05:46:37.390 --> 05:46:37.400 align:start position:0%
directly with students in person with
 
05:46:39.350 --> 05:46:39.360 align:start position:0%
students um so it's got the word
 
05:46:41.708 --> 05:46:41.718 align:start position:0%
inperson instruction you can see that on
 
05:46:44.948 --> 05:46:44.958 align:start position:0%
line five um and this will be a common
 
05:46:46.708 --> 05:46:46.718 align:start position:0%
theme that we're going to see as we go
 
05:46:49.150 --> 05:46:49.160 align:start position:0%
we go through this that uh that if
 
05:46:51.150 --> 05:46:51.160 align:start position:0%
they're providing inperson instruction
 
05:46:52.590 --> 05:46:52.600 align:start position:0%
under contract for the Department of
 
05:46:54.230 --> 05:46:54.240 align:start position:0%
Education then they need to have a
 
05:46:55.910 --> 05:46:55.920 align:start position:0%
criminal pass a criminal back history
 
05:46:59.390 --> 05:46:59.400 align:start position:0%
background check um the second part is
 
05:47:01.548 --> 05:47:01.558 align:start position:0%
actually section two another new
 
05:47:03.150 --> 05:47:03.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph and this refers to the
 
05:47:07.110 --> 05:47:07.120 align:start position:0%
education tax credit program and um and
 
05:47:10.628 --> 05:47:10.638 align:start position:0%
uh it uh leads in on lines 9 and 10 all
 
05:47:12.510 --> 05:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
employees and volunteers of non-public
 
05:47:14.230 --> 05:47:14.240 align:start position:0%
schools or providers that choose to
 
05:47:15.788 --> 05:47:15.798 align:start position:0%
accept scholarship students under this
 
05:47:19.070 --> 05:47:19.080 align:start position:0%
chapter and provide access um uh oh
 
05:47:20.670 --> 05:47:20.680 align:start position:0%
sorry to the results criminal history
 
05:47:23.670 --> 05:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
background check so so this this is
 
05:47:26.628 --> 05:47:26.638 align:start position:0%
making sure that that educational that
 
05:47:28.990 --> 05:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
sorry that providers under the education
 
05:47:32.750 --> 05:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
tax credit program are um are compliant
 
05:47:36.190 --> 05:47:36.200 align:start position:0%
with criminal background checks um Mo
 
05:47:39.750 --> 05:47:39.760 align:start position:0%
and this is where where some I I think
 
05:47:42.390 --> 05:47:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh some language as an artifact in an
 
05:47:44.990 --> 05:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
earlier version of this came into play
 
05:47:47.350 --> 05:47:47.360 align:start position:0%
Miss Miss Weeden actually uh picked up
 
05:47:49.788 --> 05:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
on this and said look I thought you
 
05:47:51.548 --> 05:47:51.558 align:start position:0%
weren't going to be impacting home
 
05:47:54.390 --> 05:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
education and no there's no intent to
 
05:47:57.430 --> 05:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
impact home education here so so it
 
05:48:01.910 --> 05:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
remedies a um um an a uh some language
 
05:48:05.350 --> 05:48:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's on 15 by striking the word home
 
05:48:08.110 --> 05:48:08.120 align:start position:0%
or home education or home education
 
05:48:09.868 --> 05:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
program sorry it strikes out those four
 
05:48:13.590 --> 05:48:13.600 align:start position:0%
words and that's the um that's what you
 
05:48:17.910 --> 05:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
see in the the amendment um uh
 
05:48:21.190 --> 05:48:21.200 align:start position:0%
0124 so uh so we get rid of the uh the
 
05:48:24.230 --> 05:48:24.240 align:start position:0%
reference to home education program um
 
05:48:27.070 --> 05:48:27.080 align:start position:0%
from from that uh paragraph the uh the
 
05:48:30.150 --> 05:48:30.160 align:start position:0%
third piece it does is talks about
 
05:48:32.548 --> 05:48:32.558 align:start position:0%
alternative programs and again we're
 
05:48:35.788 --> 05:48:35.798 align:start position:0%
talking about employees and volunteers
 
05:48:37.830 --> 05:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
um and such Alterna of program so now
 
05:48:40.830 --> 05:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sort of down at lines 23 and 24 who
 
05:48:43.150 --> 05:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
provide in-person instruction so there's
 
05:48:45.948 --> 05:48:45.958 align:start position:0%
that term again uh alternative programs
 
05:48:48.190 --> 05:48:48.200 align:start position:0%
are also commonly known as learn
 
05:48:51.230 --> 05:48:51.240 align:start position:0%
everywhere uh around the state so so
 
05:48:56.270 --> 05:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
these programs can vary from a um oh jez
 
05:48:58.110 --> 05:48:58.120 align:start position:0%
a u
 
05:49:02.430 --> 05:49:02.440 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know working work working for
 
05:49:05.350 --> 05:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
a um for or interning at a company like
 
05:49:09.868 --> 05:49:09.878 align:start position:0%
like ba systems in jhua and um uh and uh
 
05:49:12.150 --> 05:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
and yeah if you're if if you've got a
 
05:49:13.750 --> 05:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
supervisor there or somebody that you're
 
05:49:16.270 --> 05:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
working with there that's um that's as
 
05:49:18.070 --> 05:49:18.080 align:start position:0%
part of the learn everywhere program
 
05:49:19.310 --> 05:49:19.320 align:start position:0%
yeah they're going to have to pass a
 
05:49:21.230 --> 05:49:21.240 align:start position:0%
criminal history background check they
 
05:49:22.948 --> 05:49:22.958 align:start position:0%
may already have passed that if they're
 
05:49:25.030 --> 05:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
working for BA systems because a lot of
 
05:49:26.390 --> 05:49:26.400 align:start position:0%
these people I think have security
 
05:49:29.190 --> 05:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
clearances anyway I know some of my uh
 
05:49:32.150 --> 05:49:32.160 align:start position:0%
Sun friends who who work there all do so
 
05:49:33.910 --> 05:49:33.920 align:start position:0%
uh so they may have already gone through
 
05:49:35.628 --> 05:49:35.638 align:start position:0%
um through that but if you're going to
 
05:49:37.510 --> 05:49:37.520 align:start position:0%
be in front of students
 
05:49:40.468 --> 05:49:40.478 align:start position:0%
um using programs that are um that are
 
05:49:42.670 --> 05:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
that are that are essentially organized
 
05:49:44.670 --> 05:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
through through the state providing
 
05:49:46.910 --> 05:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
inperson instruction uh criminal
 
05:49:50.390 --> 05:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
background uh check is um that's the uh
 
05:49:52.670 --> 05:49:52.680 align:start position:0%
the the name of the game and the fourth
 
05:49:55.110 --> 05:49:55.120 align:start position:0%
part here and this um this is down at
 
05:49:58.590 --> 05:49:58.600 align:start position:0%
the bottom of page one and the top of
 
05:50:02.230 --> 05:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
page two uh talks about the EFA program
 
05:50:06.190 --> 05:50:06.200 align:start position:0%
and so again it's um it's uh submitting
 
05:50:07.590 --> 05:50:07.600 align:start position:0%
the results of criminal history record
 
05:50:08.708 --> 05:50:08.718 align:start position:0%
check with complies with the
 
05:50:10.510 --> 05:50:10.520 align:start position:0%
requirements blah blah blah for any
 
05:50:12.750 --> 05:50:12.760 align:start position:0%
employee or volunteer providing here's
 
05:50:16.628 --> 05:50:16.638 align:start position:0%
the term instruction in person uh uh to
 
05:50:19.190 --> 05:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
a uh to an EFA student so we're not
 
05:50:23.350 --> 05:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
talking about um you know buying buying
 
05:50:27.990 --> 05:50:28.000 align:start position:0%
books from Amazon or or um you know or
 
05:50:30.510 --> 05:50:30.520 align:start position:0%
other materials that are um that are
 
05:50:35.310 --> 05:50:35.320 align:start position:0%
that are uh that are uh eligible
 
05:50:37.788 --> 05:50:37.798 align:start position:0%
expenses that you know as part of the
 
05:50:39.468 --> 05:50:39.478 align:start position:0%
the state's Voucher Program we're
 
05:50:41.910 --> 05:50:41.920 align:start position:0%
talking about in-person instruction here
 
05:50:44.190 --> 05:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
uh I think it's a complete bill I think
 
05:50:50.110 --> 05:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
it it it closes the um the the the Hole
 
05:50:52.628 --> 05:50:52.638 align:start position:0%
uh so to speak where um where criminal
 
05:50:55.590 --> 05:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
history records checks are not being uh
 
05:50:58.910 --> 05:50:58.920 align:start position:0%
provided uh for inperson instruction
 
05:51:02.030 --> 05:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
when when State funds or state contracts
 
05:51:04.708 --> 05:51:04.718 align:start position:0%
are involved so I think it uh hopefully
 
05:51:07.990 --> 05:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
can can put this issue to rest at least
 
05:51:10.750 --> 05:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
for now and uh and I hope uh the
 
05:51:13.628 --> 05:51:13.638 align:start position:0%
committee looks looks favorably on um
 
05:51:15.030 --> 05:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
protecting the health Safety and
 
05:51:17.948 --> 05:51:17.958 align:start position:0%
Security of uh all our kids thank you
 
05:51:19.788 --> 05:51:19.798 align:start position:0%
thank you um I just have a quick
 
05:51:24.150 --> 05:51:24.160 align:start position:0%
question about the education tax credit
 
05:51:27.628 --> 05:51:27.638 align:start position:0%
money that money does not go into the
 
05:51:31.110 --> 05:51:31.120 align:start position:0%
education trust fund correct uh that's
 
05:51:34.110 --> 05:51:34.120 align:start position:0%
my understanding is it does not but I uh
 
05:51:36.788 --> 05:51:36.798 align:start position:0%
so you're still considering that to be
 
05:51:39.110 --> 05:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's state M State money
 
05:51:42.590 --> 05:51:42.600 align:start position:0%
yeah okay representative celik thank you
 
05:51:44.150 --> 05:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
so much and thank you for taking my
 
05:51:46.430 --> 05:51:46.440 align:start position:0%
question just to clarify you referen
 
05:51:48.430 --> 05:51:48.440 align:start position:0%
like someone going to work for Bae so if
 
05:51:50.590 --> 05:51:50.600 align:start position:0%
my daughter were doing her Extended
 
05:51:52.910 --> 05:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
Learning opportunity at Bae with their
 
05:51:55.070 --> 05:51:55.080 align:start position:0%
marketing department it would be the
 
05:51:56.830 --> 05:51:56.840 align:start position:0%
person she's directly working with who'd
 
05:51:58.670 --> 05:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
be subject to this not every single
 
05:52:01.150 --> 05:52:01.160 align:start position:0%
employee in the company that would be my
 
05:52:03.230 --> 05:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
make sure I understand my interpretation
 
05:52:04.910 --> 05:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
that and and the goal is to just make
 
05:52:06.910 --> 05:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
sure that people who are teaching in
 
05:52:09.150 --> 05:52:09.160 align:start position:0%
small circumstances are not uh
 
05:52:11.430 --> 05:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
perpetrators of violence against correct
 
05:52:14.708 --> 05:52:14.718 align:start position:0%
correct thank representing McDonald
 
05:52:16.750 --> 05:52:16.760 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and high
 
05:52:18.750 --> 05:52:18.760 align:start position:0%
representative um just seeing this
 
05:52:21.910 --> 05:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
amendment for the first time um provided
 
05:52:23.910 --> 05:52:23.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment is not approved the bill
 
05:52:23.920 --> 05:52:24.708 align:start position:0%
the amendment is not approved the bill
is

05:52:24.708 --> 05:52:24.718 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:52:26.708 --> 05:52:26.718 align:start position:0%
introduced would this bill require
 
05:52:29.590 --> 05:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
parents to pass background check and if
 
05:52:31.150 --> 05:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
so where would you draw the line on
 
05:52:32.788 --> 05:52:32.798 align:start position:0%
government overreach to educate their
 
05:52:34.390 --> 05:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
own children if hom school is the
 
05:52:36.628 --> 05:52:36.638 align:start position:0%
ultimate form of local control so thank
 
05:52:38.030 --> 05:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
you very much representative McDonald
 
05:52:41.270 --> 05:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
for the question I um if the Amendments
 
05:52:43.468 --> 05:52:43.478 align:start position:0%
not approved I I sort of doubt the bill
 
05:52:45.708 --> 05:52:45.718 align:start position:0%
would would be U recommended ought to
 
05:52:48.708 --> 05:52:48.718 align:start position:0%
pass but but there there's absolutely no
 
05:52:50.670 --> 05:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
intention to do criminal background
 
05:52:54.948 --> 05:52:54.958 align:start position:0%
check on um on on parents um so I I I
 
05:52:58.510 --> 05:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
draw the line right where I I think
 
05:53:00.708 --> 05:53:00.718 align:start position:0%
you're probably Drawing the Line parents
 
05:53:02.390 --> 05:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
are not subject to criminal background
 
05:53:04.868 --> 05:53:04.878 align:start position:0%
check when home educating their their
 
05:53:07.510 --> 05:53:07.520 align:start position:0%
their kids may I have a followup follow
 
05:53:08.948 --> 05:53:08.958 align:start position:0%
sure so you say that's your stated
 
05:53:11.030 --> 05:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
intention with the amendment and I would
 
05:53:13.990 --> 05:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
understand that but the the bill if the
 
05:53:16.628 --> 05:53:16.638 align:start position:0%
amendment were not to pass you would say
 
05:53:18.628 --> 05:53:18.638 align:start position:0%
should not or would not pass or is the
 
05:53:20.310 --> 05:53:20.320 align:start position:0%
amendment critical to this and it's
 
05:53:22.390 --> 05:53:22.400 align:start position:0%
detrimental if it's not included yeah so
 
05:53:24.990 --> 05:53:25.000 align:start position:0%
um so I I I think from a policy
 
05:53:27.070 --> 05:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
perspective if the amendment were not
 
05:53:29.948 --> 05:53:29.958 align:start position:0%
were to fail this committee I suspect
 
05:53:33.030 --> 05:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
the bill would also be recom we not be
 
05:53:35.110 --> 05:53:35.120 align:start position:0%
recommended out to pass so I don't
 
05:53:38.750 --> 05:53:38.760 align:start position:0%
really see that as a as a as a as a as a
 
05:53:41.750 --> 05:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
likelihood that you would you would um
 
05:53:43.150 --> 05:53:43.160 align:start position:0%
you know I obviously I don't want I'm
 
05:53:45.310 --> 05:53:45.320 align:start position:0%
not on I don't serve on this this
 
05:53:47.788 --> 05:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
committee but I see it as a very
 
05:53:50.030 --> 05:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
unlikely possibility that the committee
 
05:53:51.948 --> 05:53:51.958 align:start position:0%
would would vote down the amendment and
 
05:53:55.628 --> 05:53:55.638 align:start position:0%
vote up the uh the bill so uh you know
 
05:53:57.548 --> 05:53:57.558 align:start position:0%
are you suggesting that for whatever
 
05:53:58.948 --> 05:53:58.958 align:start position:0%
reason if the amendment were not to pass
 
05:54:00.510 --> 05:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
we should vote down this bill that's
 
05:54:02.750 --> 05:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
simply what I'm asking uh I'm not
 
05:54:04.468 --> 05:54:04.478 align:start position:0%
suggesting what you guys should do I'm
 
05:54:06.750 --> 05:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
just suggesting what what I think a ly
 
05:54:10.150 --> 05:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
outcome would be okay thank
 
05:54:12.390 --> 05:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
05:54:14.750 --> 05:54:14.760 align:start position:0%
Freeman thank you madam chair and thank
 
05:54:16.468 --> 05:54:16.478 align:start position:0%
you representative luno for coming in
 
05:54:18.110 --> 05:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
front of us so I just have a quick
 
05:54:20.788 --> 05:54:20.798 align:start position:0%
question there's a fiscal note on this
 
05:54:22.868 --> 05:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
and my concern would be who's paying for
 
05:54:26.430 --> 05:54:26.440 align:start position:0%
these background checks at $25 a pop
 
05:54:29.628 --> 05:54:29.638 align:start position:0%
yeah so so so these are all you know
 
05:54:32.948 --> 05:54:32.958 align:start position:0%
through through you know people being
 
05:54:34.750 --> 05:54:34.760 align:start position:0%
contracted with the state providing
 
05:54:36.868 --> 05:54:36.878 align:start position:0%
Services under contract for the state
 
05:54:40.270 --> 05:54:40.280 align:start position:0%
providing inperson instruction through
 
05:54:42.150 --> 05:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
programs that are that are offered
 
05:54:44.430 --> 05:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
through the state so the idea is that
 
05:54:46.910 --> 05:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
the state would be the um the the payer
 
05:54:49.590 --> 05:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
of the um the criminal background checks
 
05:54:51.670 --> 05:54:51.680 align:start position:0%
but um uh how much did you say
 
05:54:54.990 --> 05:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
$25 um you know I would want to know if
 
05:54:57.670 --> 05:54:57.680 align:start position:0%
I was a parent that and the state was
 
05:54:59.708 --> 05:54:59.718 align:start position:0%
offering educ in-person educational
 
05:55:01.910 --> 05:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
instructional services to my child that
 
05:55:04.468 --> 05:55:04.478 align:start position:0%
the state would at least invest $25 to
 
05:55:05.788 --> 05:55:05.798 align:start position:0%
make sure that they wouldn't weren't
 
05:55:07.548 --> 05:55:07.558 align:start position:0%
putting some with a criminal background
 
05:55:10.070 --> 05:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
in front of my kid thank you represent
 
05:55:12.390 --> 05:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
Morse hi yes thank you for taking my
 
05:55:14.468 --> 05:55:14.478 align:start position:0%
question as well for the question here
 
05:55:16.628 --> 05:55:16.638 align:start position:0%
um it almost seems like the amendment
 
05:55:18.190 --> 05:55:18.200 align:start position:0%
may actually be in contradiction to the
 
05:55:20.070 --> 05:55:20.080 align:start position:0%
bill itself so just help me
 
05:55:22.910 --> 05:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
clarify with EFA students some of which
 
05:55:25.510 --> 05:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
use the EA funds for homeschooling with
 
05:55:27.230 --> 05:55:27.240 align:start position:0%
their parents in
 
05:55:30.510 --> 05:55:30.520 align:start position:0%
essence using the funds it says to
 
05:55:32.548 --> 05:55:32.558 align:start position:0%
remove or home education does that also
 
05:55:35.190 --> 05:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
eliminate the education Freedom accounts
 
05:55:37.230 --> 05:55:37.240 align:start position:0%
or is that just step right because I'm
 
05:55:38.670 --> 05:55:38.680 align:start position:0%
worried about the contradic no that's a
 
05:55:40.430 --> 05:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I don't see the
 
05:55:42.830 --> 05:55:42.840 align:start position:0%
contradiction in there if you see one
 
05:55:44.628 --> 05:55:44.638 align:start position:0%
that may be something that that the
 
05:55:47.548 --> 05:55:47.558 align:start position:0%
committee may want to explore uh some
 
05:55:51.390 --> 05:55:51.400 align:start position:0%
more it's your bill and um and and you
 
05:55:53.670 --> 05:55:53.680 align:start position:0%
know I'm not trying to make um your jobs
 
05:55:56.830 --> 05:55:56.840 align:start position:0%
uh uh any harder than they already are
 
05:55:59.590 --> 05:55:59.600 align:start position:0%
but uh but if there's if there's if
 
05:56:02.350 --> 05:56:02.360 align:start position:0%
there's a problem there then then I'd be
 
05:56:03.948 --> 05:56:03.958 align:start position:0%
happy to work with any members of this
 
05:56:06.948 --> 05:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
committee to to help resolve that I I
 
05:56:09.310 --> 05:56:09.320 align:start position:0%
hope we can all agree that Health Safety
 
05:56:12.788 --> 05:56:12.798 align:start position:0%
and Security of um of our kids is a is a
 
05:56:16.270 --> 05:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
top priority but um but if so if there's
 
05:56:17.868 --> 05:56:17.878 align:start position:0%
if there's if there's a contradiction if
 
05:56:19.868 --> 05:56:19.878 align:start position:0%
there's a problem let's let's try to
 
05:56:22.190 --> 05:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
solve it representative
 
05:56:25.430 --> 05:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
dry thank you um Madam chairman thank
 
05:56:27.390 --> 05:56:27.400 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question I I just want
 
05:56:29.750 --> 05:56:29.760 align:start position:0%
to build on that when home Home
 
05:56:32.788 --> 05:56:32.798 align:start position:0%
Educators take EFA funds they no longer
 
05:56:35.468 --> 05:56:35.478 align:start position:0%
are called Home Educators they are EFA
 
05:56:36.990 --> 05:56:37.000 align:start position:0%
students so
 
05:56:41.190 --> 05:56:41.200 align:start position:0%
let's go to um the last page which is D
 
05:56:43.990 --> 05:56:44.000 align:start position:0%
where you talk about education providers
 
05:56:45.468 --> 05:56:45.478 align:start position:0%
not I'm not talking about the parents
 
05:56:47.910 --> 05:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
but I'm talking about anybody else who
 
05:56:49.468 --> 05:56:49.478 align:start position:0%
works with your student if you are
 
05:56:51.468 --> 05:56:51.478 align:start position:0%
educating at home and receiving
 
05:56:54.070 --> 05:56:54.080 align:start position:0%
education Freedom account funds you are
 
05:56:55.830 --> 05:56:55.840 align:start position:0%
no longer Home
 
05:56:58.670 --> 05:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
Educators but there are people that are
 
05:57:01.510 --> 05:57:01.520 align:start position:0%
interacting in person with your
 
05:57:03.948 --> 05:57:03.958 align:start position:0%
child this says that any employee or
 
05:57:05.310 --> 05:57:05.320 align:start position:0%
volunteer providing instruction in
 
05:57:06.830 --> 05:57:06.840 align:start position:0%
person to an EA student which your
 
05:57:08.430 --> 05:57:08.440 align:start position:0%
students are would have to do a
 
05:57:10.230 --> 05:57:10.240 align:start position:0%
background check is that what you're
 
05:57:11.948 --> 05:57:11.958 align:start position:0%
talking about would they have to do that
 
05:57:14.510 --> 05:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
I think that's that's if if you're
 
05:57:17.190 --> 05:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
you're compensating those those people
 
05:57:19.110 --> 05:57:19.120 align:start position:0%
through EFA fund so they're basically
 
05:57:20.948 --> 05:57:20.958 align:start position:0%
being paid through is it called class
 
05:57:23.868 --> 05:57:23.878 align:start position:0%
wallet from the children scholarship um
 
05:57:26.990 --> 05:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
uh fund um if if you're using your EFA
 
05:57:32.510 --> 05:57:32.520 align:start position:0%
funds to to to to um yes to pay for
 
05:57:34.270 --> 05:57:34.280 align:start position:0%
services then I think they would they
 
05:57:38.350 --> 05:57:38.360 align:start position:0%
would have to uh be uh be have to have
 
05:57:40.190 --> 05:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
provided have to gone through a criminal
 
05:57:42.910 --> 05:57:42.920 align:start position:0%
background check but but EFA funds I
 
05:57:44.548 --> 05:57:44.558 align:start position:0%
mean let's let's be let's be honest are
 
05:57:47.590 --> 05:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
we only going to go so far so so I I
 
05:57:49.830 --> 05:57:49.840 align:start position:0%
mean I think a I think a common thing
 
05:57:51.510 --> 05:57:51.520 align:start position:0%
we've heard about what about the piano
 
05:57:55.510 --> 05:57:55.520 align:start position:0%
teacher from from next door or or my my
 
05:57:58.628 --> 05:57:58.638 align:start position:0%
my aunt uh comes over and and teaches my
 
05:58:02.310 --> 05:58:02.320 align:start position:0%
son uh piano well if if they're doing
 
05:58:05.270 --> 05:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
that and not not doing that through the
 
05:58:07.430 --> 05:58:07.440 align:start position:0%
the education Freedom account program
 
05:58:09.510 --> 05:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
then no I don't see them being subject
 
05:58:11.110 --> 05:58:11.120 align:start position:0%
to a background check but if you're
 
05:58:14.030 --> 05:58:14.040 align:start position:0%
Contracting with a um with a with a with
 
05:58:16.868 --> 05:58:16.878 align:start position:0%
a piano teacher that um that's providing
 
05:58:18.628 --> 05:58:18.638 align:start position:0%
these services and you're paying that
 
05:58:20.830 --> 05:58:20.840 align:start position:0%
that piano teacher through uh through
 
05:58:23.910 --> 05:58:23.920 align:start position:0%
voucher funds then yeah they they should
 
05:58:25.708 --> 05:58:25.718 align:start position:0%
have um they they should have completed
 
05:58:27.310 --> 05:58:27.320 align:start position:0%
a criminal background check and I'll go
 
05:58:30.628 --> 05:58:30.638 align:start position:0%
a step further and say that that if um
 
05:58:32.548 --> 05:58:32.558 align:start position:0%
you know we're not we're now not talking
 
05:58:35.628 --> 05:58:35.638 align:start position:0%
about a relative or the person next door
 
05:58:37.910 --> 05:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
we're talking about somebody who who may
 
05:58:40.468 --> 05:58:40.478 align:start position:0%
be a professional um you know piano
 
05:58:44.948 --> 05:58:44.958 align:start position:0%
teacher and um and and I maybe at at
 
05:58:47.270 --> 05:58:47.280 align:start position:0%
that point it's very likely that they
 
05:58:49.548 --> 05:58:49.558 align:start position:0%
have um actually undergone a criminal
 
05:58:51.510 --> 05:58:51.520 align:start position:0%
background check you know a lot of
 
05:58:53.670 --> 05:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
people um I think would would have their
 
05:58:56.350 --> 05:58:56.360 align:start position:0%
minds put at ease if uh if somebody's
 
05:59:00.190 --> 05:59:00.200 align:start position:0%
coming over uh into their home um during
 
05:59:02.190 --> 05:59:02.200 align:start position:0%
maybe part of the time of the day when
 
05:59:04.270 --> 05:59:04.280 align:start position:0%
when there's no other uh no other adults
 
05:59:09.468 --> 05:59:09.478 align:start position:0%
at home uh to to have have you know been
 
05:59:11.990 --> 05:59:12.000 align:start position:0%
at least you know U passed a criminal
 
05:59:13.670 --> 05:59:13.680 align:start position:0%
history background check follow up
 
05:59:16.310 --> 05:59:16.320 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you um I'm just looking
 
05:59:18.750 --> 05:59:18.760 align:start position:0%
at it it says any employee or volunteer
 
05:59:20.670 --> 05:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
providing instruction so that says to me
 
05:59:22.708 --> 05:59:22.718 align:start position:0%
that they're not being paid but if
 
05:59:24.548 --> 05:59:24.558 align:start position:0%
they're even if they are
 
05:59:28.350 --> 05:59:28.360 align:start position:0%
volunteers a a person a private person
 
05:59:31.990 --> 05:59:32.000 align:start position:0%
private citizen cannot ask for a uh
 
05:59:34.670 --> 05:59:34.680 align:start position:0%
backround check on another private
 
05:59:37.030 --> 05:59:37.040 align:start position:0%
citizen How would they go about doing it
 
05:59:38.390 --> 05:59:38.400 align:start position:0%
I think they'd go through the Department
 
05:59:42.670 --> 05:59:42.680 align:start position:0%
of Education on that so and and if it's
 
05:59:44.788 --> 05:59:44.798 align:start position:0%
a volunteer maybe there are
 
05:59:48.190 --> 05:59:48.200 align:start position:0%
volunteers you know along with um with
 
05:59:50.350 --> 05:59:50.360 align:start position:0%
you know some some service that's being
 
05:59:52.430 --> 05:59:52.440 align:start position:0%
contracted for it may have a volunteer
 
05:59:54.708 --> 05:59:54.718 align:start position:0%
working for them so I'm just just you
 
05:59:57.670 --> 05:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
know leaving the door open to make sure
 
06:00:00.628 --> 06:00:00.638 align:start position:0%
that anybody that's whether they're a um
 
06:00:04.510 --> 06:00:04.520 align:start position:0%
a paid person or volunteer um through a
 
06:00:06.868 --> 06:00:06.878 align:start position:0%
a a service provider that is being paid
 
06:00:08.590 --> 06:00:08.600 align:start position:0%
for through the education Freedom
 
06:00:10.468 --> 06:00:10.478 align:start position:0%
account program if they're providing if
 
06:00:12.948 --> 06:00:12.958 align:start position:0%
they're they're if they're in person
 
06:00:16.390 --> 06:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
with um with with the student then then
 
06:00:18.430 --> 06:00:18.440 align:start position:0%
yeah this bill is having him um go
 
06:00:20.990 --> 06:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
through a criminal background check
 
06:00:21.000 --> 06:00:22.510 align:start position:0%
through a criminal background check
represent

06:00:22.510 --> 06:00:22.520 align:start position:0%
represent
 
06:00:26.510 --> 06:00:26.520 align:start position:0%
wck good afternoon representative um Uno
 
06:00:29.150 --> 06:00:29.160 align:start position:0%
the question I have just f up on
 
06:00:32.270 --> 06:00:32.280 align:start position:0%
representative dr's question if I recall
 
06:00:34.468 --> 06:00:34.478 align:start position:0%
and I'm probably wrong you're old on you
 
06:00:36.948 --> 06:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
might remember this better volunteers
 
06:00:40.190 --> 06:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
and Volunteers in public school who come
 
06:00:42.708 --> 06:00:42.718 align:start position:0%
on a regular basis they aren't they
 
06:00:45.150 --> 06:00:45.160 align:start position:0%
required the same background check as
 
06:00:48.350 --> 06:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
pay feature I think they are I think
 
06:00:51.948 --> 06:00:51.958 align:start position:0%
they are volunteers but yeah okay yeah
 
06:00:55.868 --> 06:00:55.878 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you any other
 
06:00:58.150 --> 06:00:58.160 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
06:00:59.788 --> 06:00:59.798 align:start position:0%
much thank you you've been very generous
 
06:01:04.510 --> 06:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:14.670 --> 06:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:01:16.628 --> 06:01:16.638 align:start position:0%
ring thank you madam chair and members
 
06:01:18.350 --> 06:01:18.360 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Steven King
 
06:01:20.350 --> 06:01:20.360 align:start position:0%
I represent uh Hillsboro 18 in
 
06:01:22.310 --> 06:01:22.320 align:start position:0%
Manchester uh bear with me I got a
 
06:01:24.110 --> 06:01:24.120 align:start position:0%
little bit of a cold or not so much a
 
06:01:26.510 --> 06:01:26.520 align:start position:0%
cold but like allergies going on today
 
06:01:28.310 --> 06:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
um so I want to kind of go over this it
 
06:01:29.750 --> 06:01:29.760 align:start position:0%
changed my mind of what I was going to
 
06:01:31.310 --> 06:01:31.320 align:start position:0%
say I kind of threw that idea out of the
 
06:01:32.670 --> 06:01:32.680 align:start position:0%
window after I heard everybody's
 
06:01:34.708 --> 06:01:34.718 align:start position:0%
questions um and actually on the back
 
06:01:36.990 --> 06:01:37.000 align:start position:0%
where uh he just left off at it says
 
06:01:39.788 --> 06:01:39.798 align:start position:0%
submit results uh criminal background
 
06:01:43.230 --> 06:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
history with a volunteer there um so to
 
06:01:44.990 --> 06:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
look at this perspective he did say that
 
06:01:46.270 --> 06:01:46.280 align:start position:0%
it should be anybody that's receiving
 
06:01:48.230 --> 06:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
funds it doesn't say that in the bill
 
06:01:49.628 --> 06:01:49.638 align:start position:0%
and actually the amendment actually
 
06:01:51.350 --> 06:01:51.360 align:start position:0%
changes it to the fact that it makes
 
06:01:54.310 --> 06:01:54.320 align:start position:0%
more confusing light of it um but I
 
06:01:55.788 --> 06:01:55.798 align:start position:0%
would say that that volunteer there
 
06:01:57.868 --> 06:01:57.878 align:start position:0%
providing instruction any person in EFA
 
06:02:00.190 --> 06:02:00.200 align:start position:0%
student so like you did say the EFA
 
06:02:02.628 --> 06:02:02.638 align:start position:0%
student is anybody receiving those funds
 
06:02:05.390 --> 06:02:05.400 align:start position:0%
so now again he did mention that like my
 
06:02:07.070 --> 06:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
father-in who teaches my daughter
 
06:02:08.948 --> 06:02:08.958 align:start position:0%
accordion would now have to go through a
 
06:02:10.548 --> 06:02:10.558 align:start position:0%
background check if my mother-in-law
 
06:02:11.910 --> 06:02:11.920 align:start position:0%
decided to teach her math they would
 
06:02:13.670 --> 06:02:13.680 align:start position:0%
have to according to this bill we can
 
06:02:16.310 --> 06:02:16.320 align:start position:0%
say all day long that there is an issue
 
06:02:18.070 --> 06:02:18.080 align:start position:0%
with the way the wording is but it
 
06:02:20.590 --> 06:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't say collecting funds through
 
06:02:22.830 --> 06:02:22.840 align:start position:0%
class wallet it doesn't say anything
 
06:02:24.788 --> 06:02:24.798 align:start position:0%
specific and again according to
 
06:02:26.390 --> 06:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor they have no purview
 
06:02:27.990 --> 06:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
over that if you not labor sorry
 
06:02:30.430 --> 06:02:30.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education uh again that's
 
06:02:31.628 --> 06:02:31.638 align:start position:0%
something the department probably be
 
06:02:34.190 --> 06:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
able to shed more light on for you um
 
06:02:36.190 --> 06:02:36.200 align:start position:0%
but again the word volunteers mentioned
 
06:02:38.310 --> 06:02:38.320 align:start position:0%
several times in the bill which would
 
06:02:40.910 --> 06:02:40.920 align:start position:0%
also qualify for those people so again I
 
06:02:43.350 --> 06:02:43.360 align:start position:0%
I just looking at this I mean it's been
 
06:02:44.708 --> 06:02:44.718 align:start position:0%
obviously a transition from the last
 
06:02:46.708 --> 06:02:46.718 align:start position:0%
bill a little bit uh that came through
 
06:02:48.270 --> 06:02:48.280 align:start position:0%
last time but I would encourage you guys
 
06:02:51.628 --> 06:02:51.638 align:start position:0%
to itl this bill by if you have any
 
06:02:54.468 --> 06:02:54.478 align:start position:0%
question any questions seeing none thank
 
06:02:57.948 --> 06:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:17.190 --> 06:03:17.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:18.270 --> 06:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair honorable
 
06:03:19.830 --> 06:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
committee for record representative
 
06:03:22.788 --> 06:03:22.798 align:start position:0%
Henry gon Hillsboro 29th
 
06:03:25.708 --> 06:03:25.718 align:start position:0%
District so part of the reason that we
 
06:03:27.750 --> 06:03:27.760 align:start position:0%
do background checks in public education
 
06:03:31.830 --> 06:03:31.840 align:start position:0%
is because we are trying to protect kids
 
06:03:33.910 --> 06:03:33.920 align:start position:0%
when they are not in the cust uh custody
 
06:03:35.350 --> 06:03:35.360 align:start position:0%
of their Prime custodian their parents
 
06:03:35.360 --> 06:03:36.350 align:start position:0%
of their Prime custodian their parents
usually

06:03:36.350 --> 06:03:36.360 align:start position:0%
usually
 
06:03:37.670 --> 06:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
the other part of the reason is to try
 
06:03:40.990 --> 06:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
to absolve liability on the state when
 
06:03:42.350 --> 06:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
an instance like we heard about the
 
06:03:44.110 --> 06:03:44.120 align:start position:0%
other day happens so that the state can
 
06:03:45.788 --> 06:03:45.798 align:start position:0%
say we under good authority did
 
06:03:47.868 --> 06:03:47.878 align:start position:0%
background checks in order to try to do
 
06:03:50.230 --> 06:03:50.240 align:start position:0%
the best that we could now obviously no
 
06:03:51.510 --> 06:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
system is perfect and somebody slips
 
06:03:52.788 --> 06:03:52.798 align:start position:0%
through the cracks but we can honestly
 
06:03:54.430 --> 06:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
say that as a state we did the best that
 
06:03:56.590 --> 06:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
we could to protect children while they
 
06:03:57.910 --> 06:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
were in our
 
06:04:01.310 --> 06:04:01.320 align:start position:0%
charge having this bill apply to
 
06:04:03.750 --> 06:04:03.760 align:start position:0%
homeschool networks and to private
 
06:04:06.430 --> 06:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
education accounts does not meet two of
 
06:04:08.150 --> 06:04:08.160 align:start position:0%
those standards both of those standards
 
06:04:10.190 --> 06:04:10.200 align:start position:0%
one of them is the parents are directly
 
06:04:11.788 --> 06:04:11.798 align:start position:0%
involved whereas at a private school or
 
06:04:13.190 --> 06:04:13.200 align:start position:0%
a public school the parents are not at
 
06:04:15.030 --> 06:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
school the parents are directly involved
 
06:04:17.430 --> 06:04:17.440 align:start position:0%
in the selection process in a homeschool
 
06:04:21.788 --> 06:04:21.798 align:start position:0%
Network or in Freedom account situation
 
06:04:23.468 --> 06:04:23.478 align:start position:0%
they are never not the custodian of the
 
06:04:27.070 --> 06:04:27.080 align:start position:0%
child or the protector of the child so
 
06:04:29.510 --> 06:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
you know and and there is no State
 
06:04:31.628 --> 06:04:31.638 align:start position:0%
liability so we're asking the state to
 
06:04:33.190 --> 06:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
spend money in a place where there is no
 
06:04:35.910 --> 06:04:35.920 align:start position:0%
State liability where there is liability
 
06:04:37.948 --> 06:04:37.958 align:start position:0%
in the public education system or even
 
06:04:39.510 --> 06:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
in a private education system that's
 
06:04:41.230 --> 06:04:41.240 align:start position:0%
licensed through the state so this
 
06:04:42.708 --> 06:04:42.718 align:start position:0%
doesn't meet either criteria that makes
 
06:04:45.070 --> 06:04:45.080 align:start position:0%
it good legislation in addition to the
 
06:04:46.230 --> 06:04:46.240 align:start position:0%
fact that it's written in a very
 
06:04:47.948 --> 06:04:47.958 align:start position:0%
ambiguous way that would be very hard to
 
06:04:52.030 --> 06:04:52.040 align:start position:0%
enforce or or uh or judicially interpret
 
06:04:54.670 --> 06:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time thank you
 
06:04:54.680 --> 06:04:55.670 align:start position:0%
so thank you for your time thank you
representative

06:04:55.670 --> 06:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:04:58.350 --> 06:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
selig thank you so um forgive me I'm not
 
06:05:00.070 --> 06:05:00.080 align:start position:0%
familiar with which incident happened
 
06:05:03.030 --> 06:05:03.040 align:start position:0%
the other day but um the bill references
 
06:05:05.110 --> 06:05:05.120 align:start position:0%
non-public schools which to my
 
06:05:06.430 --> 06:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
understanding would include private
 
06:05:08.510 --> 06:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
schools parochial schools and other
 
06:05:11.948 --> 06:05:11.958 align:start position:0%
small or large Independent Schools of of
 
06:05:11.958 --> 06:05:13.350 align:start position:0%
small or large Independent Schools of of
whatever

06:05:13.350 --> 06:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
whatever
 
06:05:15.788 --> 06:05:15.798 align:start position:0%
size in addition separate from The
 
06:05:17.948 --> 06:05:17.958 align:start position:0%
Homeschool component but just it
 
06:05:20.670 --> 06:05:20.680 align:start position:0%
references those schools specifically do
 
06:05:23.230 --> 06:05:23.240 align:start position:0%
is it your belief that the people who
 
06:05:24.788 --> 06:05:24.798 align:start position:0%
work at those schools should not be
 
06:05:29.230 --> 06:05:29.240 align:start position:0%
subject to background checks
 
06:05:31.190 --> 06:05:31.200 align:start position:0%
because uh is that not sorry I was
 
06:05:33.310 --> 06:05:33.320 align:start position:0%
asking that y the person testifying not
 
06:05:35.270 --> 06:05:35.280 align:start position:0%
the committee thank you is that not
 
06:05:36.548 --> 06:05:36.558 align:start position:0%
already the
 
06:05:38.230 --> 06:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
policy I don't know that it's a
 
06:05:39.990 --> 06:05:40.000 align:start position:0%
guaranteed policy at all schools so
 
06:05:41.628 --> 06:05:41.638 align:start position:0%
should we not make sure that that's the
 
06:05:43.868 --> 06:05:43.878 align:start position:0%
policy at all schools unless there's an
 
06:05:47.910 --> 06:05:47.920 align:start position:0%
issue where the state is liable or where
 
06:05:50.628 --> 06:05:50.638 align:start position:0%
we see an issue that needs to be
 
06:05:52.430 --> 06:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
addressed no I don't think it's the
 
06:05:53.750 --> 06:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
perview of the state to reach into
 
06:05:53.760 --> 06:05:55.150 align:start position:0%
perview of the state to reach into
private

06:05:55.150 --> 06:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
private
 
06:05:58.150 --> 06:05:58.160 align:start position:0%
entities representative wock than you m
 
06:06:00.310 --> 06:06:00.320 align:start position:0%
chair good afternoon thank you for
 
06:06:02.990 --> 06:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
sticking around thank you um you talked
 
06:06:05.868 --> 06:06:05.878 align:start position:0%
about the the your concern the I it was
 
06:06:09.830 --> 06:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
a h school network that those youngsters
 
06:06:11.910 --> 06:06:11.920 align:start position:0%
enrolled at are selected by the parent
 
06:06:14.030 --> 06:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
to go there and I just want to
 
06:06:18.030 --> 06:06:18.040 align:start position:0%
differentiate that the if I'm clear the
 
06:06:22.708 --> 06:06:22.718 align:start position:0%
parent May select uh Network a to send
 
06:06:24.990 --> 06:06:25.000 align:start position:0%
my child of a home school to this young
 
06:06:26.830 --> 06:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
lady who's teaching a home school
 
06:06:29.750 --> 06:06:29.760 align:start position:0%
network but when they go to that hom
 
06:06:32.788 --> 06:06:32.798 align:start position:0%
school program correct uh your parents
 
06:06:34.548 --> 06:06:34.558 align:start position:0%
not with them all the time the parents
 
06:06:36.788 --> 06:06:36.798 align:start position:0%
not the oversight the guardian at that
 
06:06:38.990 --> 06:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
time and I think the bill was trying to
 
06:06:43.070 --> 06:06:43.080 align:start position:0%
get to the point that if if whoever I
 
06:06:45.708 --> 06:06:45.718 align:start position:0%
hire uh to teach my children if they're
 
06:06:48.670 --> 06:06:48.680 align:start position:0%
home school or whatever is or how you
 
06:06:49.948 --> 06:06:49.958 align:start position:0%
whichever category you want to put them
 
06:06:52.310 --> 06:06:52.320 align:start position:0%
in you're not there as the parent is the
 
06:06:54.948 --> 06:06:54.958 align:start position:0%
guardian so this document this criminal
 
06:06:56.750 --> 06:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
background check is an assurance to
 
06:06:58.548 --> 06:06:58.558 align:start position:0%
those parents even though I mean they
 
06:07:00.310 --> 06:07:00.320 align:start position:0%
pick out a public school to go and the
 
06:07:01.750 --> 06:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
public schools checked all the people
 
06:07:02.868 --> 06:07:02.878 align:start position:0%
they're not sure about all the people
 
06:07:04.310 --> 06:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
but that's Public School done due
 
06:07:05.948 --> 06:07:05.958 align:start position:0%
diligence the same thing here the
 
06:07:08.070 --> 06:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
background check is a standard for due
 
06:07:09.788 --> 06:07:09.798 align:start position:0%
diligence that you can feel comfortable
 
06:07:12.708 --> 06:07:12.718 align:start position:0%
with that this lady who's teaching uh
 
06:07:16.948 --> 06:07:16.958 align:start position:0%
OBO is is um at least has a background
 
06:07:18.230 --> 06:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
check you may have selected her because
 
06:07:19.350 --> 06:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
that's what you wanted to teach or you
 
06:07:22.110 --> 06:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
know she's a teacher of that was my
 
06:07:23.708 --> 06:07:23.718 align:start position:0%
confusion question you have a question
 
06:07:25.190 --> 06:07:25.200 align:start position:0%
yeah was because he said that the
 
06:07:27.948 --> 06:07:27.958 align:start position:0%
parental the parent custody of the child
 
06:07:29.110 --> 06:07:29.120 align:start position:0%
he said the parents and custody of the
 
06:07:30.548 --> 06:07:30.558 align:start position:0%
child trying to make a point that they
 
06:07:32.708 --> 06:07:32.718 align:start position:0%
weren't in Cody the child I don't think
 
06:07:34.990 --> 06:07:35.000 align:start position:0%
because they leave ated entity that that
 
06:07:38.548 --> 06:07:38.558 align:start position:0%
was that's I trying to clarify from your
 
06:07:40.990 --> 06:07:41.000 align:start position:0%
testimony now respectfully sir I have no
 
06:07:42.670 --> 06:07:42.680 align:start position:0%
idea what your question is I'm sorry the
 
06:07:44.548 --> 06:07:44.558 align:start position:0%
question is do you believe that you said
 
06:07:47.190 --> 06:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
that the parent custody of the child is
 
06:07:48.788 --> 06:07:48.798 align:start position:0%
theirs and you were concerned about
 
06:07:50.390 --> 06:07:50.400 align:start position:0%
State liability and I was suggesting to
 
06:07:53.110 --> 06:07:53.120 align:start position:0%
you once even even in homeschool bound
 
06:07:55.270 --> 06:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
programs as you said when they go to a
 
06:07:57.750 --> 06:07:57.760 align:start position:0%
provider from even the home you selected
 
06:08:00.990 --> 06:08:01.000 align:start position:0%
that person that person is you the
 
06:08:03.708 --> 06:08:03.718 align:start position:0%
parents not there so that's what they
 
06:08:05.030 --> 06:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
that's why the background check would be
 
06:08:06.990 --> 06:08:07.000 align:start position:0%
requested that's that was the you seem
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
to insinuate the parent would be there
 
06:08:09.910 --> 06:08:09.920 align:start position:0%
because they selected the person the
 
06:08:11.788 --> 06:08:11.798 align:start position:0%
parent's not in custody of that child
 
06:08:13.868 --> 06:08:13.878 align:start position:0%
the teacher is there with a child 101
 
06:08:15.670 --> 06:08:15.680 align:start position:0%
think that was my question versus your
 
06:08:17.270 --> 06:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
statement that's all if it's confusing
 
06:08:19.788 --> 06:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
I'll let it go they don't answer I'm
 
06:08:21.468 --> 06:08:21.478 align:start position:0%
asking you if it's confusing to you or
 
06:08:22.910 --> 06:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
to me I won't do it I won't ask it
 
06:08:24.590 --> 06:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
that's fine I just don't know what the
 
06:08:26.070 --> 06:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
question is I didn't insinuate anything
 
06:08:27.788 --> 06:08:27.798 align:start position:0%
I I I stated very clearly that the
 
06:08:29.390 --> 06:08:29.400 align:start position:0%
reason that we do background checks for
 
06:08:32.750 --> 06:08:32.760 align:start position:0%
public schools is to absolve liability
 
06:08:35.708 --> 06:08:35.718 align:start position:0%
and to protect children so
 
06:08:37.708 --> 06:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
representative Murray thank you madam
 
06:08:39.548 --> 06:08:39.558 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for taking my question
 
06:08:40.990 --> 06:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
one of the questions that I had I think
 
06:08:43.150 --> 06:08:43.160 align:start position:0%
you mentioned public oversight but there
 
06:08:45.350 --> 06:08:45.360 align:start position:0%
is a public taxpayer accountability
 
06:08:47.708 --> 06:08:47.718 align:start position:0%
component to this through the EFA wallet
 
06:08:51.030 --> 06:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
so my question was would language that
 
06:08:53.110 --> 06:08:53.120 align:start position:0%
was would there be more amendable
 
06:08:55.110 --> 06:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
language to something like a third-party
 
06:08:59.070 --> 06:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
doe approved provider who is providing
 
06:09:01.830 --> 06:09:01.840 align:start position:0%
services within these programs outside
 
06:09:05.430 --> 06:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
of I understood the questions about um
 
06:09:08.548 --> 06:09:08.558 align:start position:0%
home educator or a parent homeschooling
 
06:09:10.910 --> 06:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
that I understand would there be more
 
06:09:13.030 --> 06:09:13.040 align:start position:0%
amenable language that you could support
 
06:09:15.110 --> 06:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
to ensure that thirdparty outside
 
06:09:16.910 --> 06:09:16.920 align:start position:0%
entities who are approved for
 
06:09:18.350 --> 06:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
reimbursement Services through the
 
06:09:21.150 --> 06:09:21.160 align:start position:0%
department of Ed were having these
 
06:09:23.628 --> 06:09:23.638 align:start position:0%
background checks
 
06:09:25.590 --> 06:09:25.600 align:start position:0%
done representative thank you for the
 
06:09:27.628 --> 06:09:27.638 align:start position:0%
question I would have to see that bill
 
06:09:30.070 --> 06:09:30.080 align:start position:0%
but that is not this bill initially my
 
06:09:31.788 --> 06:09:31.798 align:start position:0%
reaction would be to favor against it
 
06:09:34.670 --> 06:09:34.680 align:start position:0%
just because again it it takes on uh it
 
06:09:36.708 --> 06:09:36.718 align:start position:0%
shifts live ility to the state is now an
 
06:09:37.990 --> 06:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
entity that's responsible for doing
 
06:09:39.510 --> 06:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
these background checks which can slow
 
06:09:41.830 --> 06:09:41.840 align:start position:0%
down the process for private um for
 
06:09:45.110 --> 06:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
private interactions but that's not this
 
06:09:47.788 --> 06:09:47.798 align:start position:0%
bill representative
 
06:09:50.190 --> 06:09:50.200 align:start position:0%
Lichfield thank you madam chair and
 
06:09:52.070 --> 06:09:52.080 align:start position:0%
thank you representative for taking my
 
06:09:54.430 --> 06:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
question so I just want to ask you that
 
06:09:56.190 --> 06:09:56.200 align:start position:0%
since right now we're talking about
 
06:09:58.230 --> 06:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
State funds and we're talking about
 
06:10:00.030 --> 06:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
background checks because State funds
 
06:10:04.310 --> 06:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
are involved if we have a parent that is
 
06:10:06.990 --> 06:10:07.000 align:start position:0%
accepting Medicaid Aid or Medicare if
 
06:10:08.910 --> 06:10:08.920 align:start position:0%
they're disabled but they're accepting
 
06:10:10.788 --> 06:10:10.798 align:start position:0%
some type of payment from the state and
 
06:10:12.830 --> 06:10:12.840 align:start position:0%
they're looking to hire a babysitter
 
06:10:14.628 --> 06:10:14.638 align:start position:0%
should we do a background check on that
 
06:10:16.230 --> 06:10:16.240 align:start position:0%
babysitter since they are receiving
 
06:10:16.240 --> 06:10:17.390 align:start position:0%
babysitter since they are receiving
State

06:10:17.390 --> 06:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
State
 
06:10:20.628 --> 06:10:20.638 align:start position:0%
funds thank you for the question rep uh
 
06:10:22.628 --> 06:10:22.638 align:start position:0%
representative again I would say that's
 
06:10:24.990 --> 06:10:25.000 align:start position:0%
that's not this bill but if I saw that
 
06:10:26.910 --> 06:10:26.920 align:start position:0%
bill in front of me I would I would lean
 
06:10:28.628 --> 06:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
toward favoring against it as an
 
06:10:31.270 --> 06:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
overreach into somebody's Private
 
06:10:34.190 --> 06:10:34.200 align:start position:0%
Affairs representative Morris thank you
 
06:10:35.390 --> 06:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
madam chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:10:37.590 --> 06:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
question so I have a very right over
 
06:10:37.600 --> 06:10:38.468 align:start position:0%
question so I have a very right over
here

06:10:38.468 --> 06:10:38.478 align:start position:0%
here
 
06:10:41.390 --> 06:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
sorry very very very simple question
 
06:10:43.310 --> 06:10:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's probably going to be the easiest
 
06:10:45.868 --> 06:10:45.878 align:start position:0%
that you're going to get
 
06:10:48.948 --> 06:10:48.958 align:start position:0%
um no matter what laws regulations or
 
06:10:50.430 --> 06:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
anything you put in place is it true
 
06:10:51.670 --> 06:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
that criminals will just be criminals
 
06:10:54.708 --> 06:10:54.718 align:start position:0%
and they'll break them if they decide
 
06:10:57.030 --> 06:10:57.040 align:start position:0%
to honorable has been representative yes
 
06:10:59.430 --> 06:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
sir that's true um I mean I I I'm a
 
06:11:00.788 --> 06:11:00.798 align:start position:0%
proud veteran of the United States Army
 
06:11:02.590 --> 06:11:02.600 align:start position:0%
24-year Career and I would submit to you
 
06:11:04.110 --> 06:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
that we have one of the best background
 
06:11:05.910 --> 06:11:05.920 align:start position:0%
check systems in place place with
 
06:11:08.670 --> 06:11:08.680 align:start position:0%
security clearances Etc and sometimes a
 
06:11:10.990 --> 06:11:11.000 align:start position:0%
bad player gets through um you know to
 
06:11:12.468 --> 06:11:12.478 align:start position:0%
be to be an educator you have to go
 
06:11:13.670 --> 06:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
through one of these background checks
 
06:11:15.070 --> 06:11:15.080 align:start position:0%
and for anybody that didn't get the news
 
06:11:16.708 --> 06:11:16.718 align:start position:0%
there's there's somebody accused of
 
06:11:18.590 --> 06:11:18.600 align:start position:0%
improprieties with children in one of
 
06:11:20.390 --> 06:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
our school districts uh here within the
 
06:11:22.708 --> 06:11:22.718 align:start position:0%
past week I would suggest that again the
 
06:11:24.270 --> 06:11:24.280 align:start position:0%
state did everything it prudently could
 
06:11:26.270 --> 06:11:26.280 align:start position:0%
do to absolve liability for suit against
 
06:11:28.590 --> 06:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
the state or Department of Education but
 
06:11:29.990 --> 06:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes Bad actors get through and
 
06:11:32.868 --> 06:11:32.878 align:start position:0%
also sometimes people change um people
 
06:11:34.350 --> 06:11:34.360 align:start position:0%
have have experiences that change them
 
06:11:36.350 --> 06:11:36.360 align:start position:0%
and not always for the better so
 
06:11:38.310 --> 06:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately no matter how much we try
 
06:11:40.670 --> 06:11:40.680 align:start position:0%
to legislate from here there are going
 
06:11:42.110 --> 06:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
to be bad actors that get through and
 
06:11:43.468 --> 06:11:43.478 align:start position:0%
that's one of the reasons that I remind
 
06:11:45.510 --> 06:11:45.520 align:start position:0%
this body that as legislators we don't
 
06:11:47.310 --> 06:11:47.320 align:start position:0%
make polite suggestions we make laws
 
06:11:49.390 --> 06:11:49.400 align:start position:0%
that are backed by people with with guns
 
06:11:51.030 --> 06:11:51.040 align:start position:0%
and that will will commit fines and
 
06:11:53.708 --> 06:11:53.718 align:start position:0%
penalties against the people so if you
 
06:11:55.750 --> 06:11:55.760 align:start position:0%
are not completely confident our first
 
06:11:57.350 --> 06:11:57.360 align:start position:0%
duty is to protect the rights of the
 
06:11:58.750 --> 06:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
people and if the government isn't a
 
06:12:00.430 --> 06:12:00.440 align:start position:0%
victim here then the government has no
 
06:12:02.948 --> 06:12:02.958 align:start position:0%
role in getting into the rights of the
 
06:12:05.990 --> 06:12:06.000 align:start position:0%
people any other questions
 
06:12:07.750 --> 06:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
06:12:10.788 --> 06:12:10.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:30.788 --> 06:12:30.798 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:33.670 --> 06:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
Markle hi thank you for listening to me
 
06:12:35.548 --> 06:12:35.558 align:start position:0%
my name is Louise Martell and I live in
 
06:12:37.548 --> 06:12:37.558 align:start position:0%
Berlin New Hampshire and my husband and
 
06:12:40.990 --> 06:12:41.000 align:start position:0%
I homeschool are two adopted children
 
06:12:42.948 --> 06:12:42.958 align:start position:0%
and we are
 
06:12:46.230 --> 06:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
unfunded and so we don't really belong
 
06:12:48.910 --> 06:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
in this group we're not receiving funds
 
06:12:51.030 --> 06:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
from the state in any way we don't
 
06:12:52.590 --> 06:12:52.600 align:start position:0%
receive medicare from the state we don't
 
06:12:54.270 --> 06:12:54.280 align:start position:0%
do anything with the state this is
 
06:12:56.230 --> 06:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
something that we chose for our children
 
06:12:59.628 --> 06:12:59.638 align:start position:0%
because they respond really well to
 
06:13:02.190 --> 06:13:02.200 align:start position:0%
homeschooling I'm not entirely opposed
 
06:13:04.110 --> 06:13:04.120 align:start position:0%
to background checks when they're
 
06:13:06.150 --> 06:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
necessary I've been through many
 
06:13:09.110 --> 06:13:09.120 align:start position:0%
background checks I was a CA I adopted
 
06:13:11.788 --> 06:13:11.798 align:start position:0%
children I worked for the church I've
 
06:13:14.750 --> 06:13:14.760 align:start position:0%
had background checks but I find this to
 
06:13:15.628 --> 06:13:15.638 align:start position:0%
be an
 
06:13:20.430 --> 06:13:20.440 align:start position:0%
overreach and the bill is poorly written
 
06:13:22.628 --> 06:13:22.638 align:start position:0%
it includes people that should not be
 
06:13:24.990 --> 06:13:25.000 align:start position:0%
included in this group it's negligent
 
06:13:27.110 --> 06:13:27.120 align:start position:0%
defining who is directed to assigning
 
06:13:27.120 --> 06:13:28.070 align:start position:0%
defining who is directed to assigning
background

06:13:28.070 --> 06:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
background
 
06:13:30.750 --> 06:13:30.760 align:start position:0%
checks which educational pathway will it
 
06:13:32.990 --> 06:13:33.000 align:start position:0%
affect the EFA or the
 
06:13:36.230 --> 06:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
193a they're two different pathways
 
06:13:37.830 --> 06:13:37.840 align:start position:0%
even though they might call themselves
 
06:13:40.190 --> 06:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
homeschooling it's a different pathway
 
06:13:41.750 --> 06:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
and there's different regulations when
 
06:13:43.868 --> 06:13:43.878 align:start position:0%
you're receiving funds from the state
 
06:13:45.350 --> 06:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
there are certain things that you have
 
06:13:48.548 --> 06:13:48.558 align:start position:0%
you expect but when you're not expected
 
06:13:50.150 --> 06:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
get getting the money from the state
 
06:13:52.310 --> 06:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
then stay out of my business you know
 
06:13:54.628 --> 06:13:54.638 align:start position:0%
it's it's as simple as that I love my
 
06:13:57.708 --> 06:13:57.718 align:start position:0%
children home education families choose
 
06:13:59.190 --> 06:13:59.200 align:start position:0%
the pathways appropriate for their
 
06:14:00.750 --> 06:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
families this bill does not
 
06:14:02.548 --> 06:14:02.558 align:start position:0%
differentiate the pathways public
 
06:14:04.830 --> 06:14:04.840 align:start position:0%
schools have fewer restrictions I've
 
06:14:06.910 --> 06:14:06.920 align:start position:0%
been asked to volunteer at public school
 
06:14:08.190 --> 06:14:08.200 align:start position:0%
and they didn't know I had a background
 
06:14:10.070 --> 06:14:10.080 align:start position:0%
check or not my husband works for the
 
06:14:12.750 --> 06:14:12.760 align:start position:0%
public school in our area he's a coach
 
06:14:15.350 --> 06:14:15.360 align:start position:0%
you know he has been
 
06:14:15.360 --> 06:14:17.030 align:start position:0%
you know he has been
vetted

06:14:17.030 --> 06:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
vetted
 
06:14:20.030 --> 06:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
um I just find this bill does not State
 
06:14:21.590 --> 06:14:21.600 align:start position:0%
who is to pay for all these background
 
06:14:23.350 --> 06:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
checks who is to administer and enforce
 
06:14:25.070 --> 06:14:25.080 align:start position:0%
them who will pay for the bureaucratic
 
06:14:27.910 --> 06:14:27.920 align:start position:0%
nightmare that I see happening I see it
 
06:14:29.548 --> 06:14:29.558 align:start position:0%
as an overreach because it I don't think
 
06:14:31.788 --> 06:14:31.798 align:start position:0%
it's going to stop here I don't think
 
06:14:34.310 --> 06:14:34.320 align:start position:0%
it's going to just stop with EFA or even
 
06:14:35.750 --> 06:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
with homeschool Fe families I think it's
 
06:14:37.628 --> 06:14:37.638 align:start position:0%
going to be expected from all families
 
06:14:39.510 --> 06:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
and families have a right to their
 
06:14:42.788 --> 06:14:42.798 align:start position:0%
privacy you know not all families are
 
06:14:44.590 --> 06:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
bad not all families are good but there
 
06:14:46.390 --> 06:14:46.400 align:start position:0%
are other ways of determining these
 
06:14:49.110 --> 06:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
things without invasion of
 
06:14:51.430 --> 06:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
privacy um this place is an undue
 
06:14:54.390 --> 06:14:54.400 align:start position:0%
Financial constraint on many 193a home
 
06:14:58.548 --> 06:14:58.558 align:start position:0%
education families and uh I I consider
 
06:14:59.868 --> 06:14:59.878 align:start position:0%
this government overreach power
 
06:15:01.430 --> 06:15:01.440 align:start position:0%
excellence and intrusion on every
 
06:15:02.910 --> 06:15:02.920 align:start position:0%
parents right to direct their children's
 
06:15:05.910 --> 06:15:05.920 align:start position:0%
education and Welfare so
 
06:15:07.468 --> 06:15:07.478 align:start position:0%
I don't think parents should be
 
06:15:09.868 --> 06:15:09.878 align:start position:0%
subjected to criminal background checks
 
06:15:12.230 --> 06:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
like I said I see it as a bureaucratic
 
06:15:15.350 --> 06:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
nightmare thank you representative
 
06:15:17.350 --> 06:15:17.360 align:start position:0%
Hall chair thank you for taking my
 
06:15:18.948 --> 06:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
question would you say the amendment
 
06:15:20.628 --> 06:15:20.638 align:start position:0%
does stay out of your business the
 
06:15:23.548 --> 06:15:23.558 align:start position:0%
amendment no it does not say stay out of
 
06:15:25.270 --> 06:15:25.280 align:start position:0%
my business it's in my business I'm a
 
06:15:27.670 --> 06:15:27.680 align:start position:0%
homeschool Mom it doesn't exclude us
 
06:15:29.628 --> 06:15:29.638 align:start position:0%
from background checks and I work with
 
06:15:32.230 --> 06:15:32.240 align:start position:0%
other families who do receive EFA we
 
06:15:35.510 --> 06:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
have a co-op I teach at this EFA I mean
 
06:15:38.590 --> 06:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
at be a co-op and I'm not being I'm not
 
06:15:40.590 --> 06:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
being paid I'm a volunteer it would mean
 
06:15:41.948 --> 06:15:41.958 align:start position:0%
that I would have to have a background
 
06:15:44.830 --> 06:15:44.840 align:start position:0%
check because they're EFA parents there
 
06:15:46.990 --> 06:15:47.000 align:start position:0%
it does not you know it's like why would
 
06:15:49.468 --> 06:15:49.478 align:start position:0%
I have to pay for a background check or
 
06:15:51.350 --> 06:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
even have a background check when it
 
06:15:54.390 --> 06:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't even it's not I'm there I'm
 
06:15:55.468 --> 06:15:55.478 align:start position:0%

06:15:59.270 --> 06:15:59.280 align:start position:0%

06:16:09.990 --> 06:16:10.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
06:16:18.750 --> 06:16:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:21.190 --> 06:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
you I gave
 
06:16:35.430 --> 06:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:36.590 --> 06:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time committee
 
06:16:38.468 --> 06:16:38.478 align:start position:0%
members my name is Diane Nolan from
 
06:16:41.070 --> 06:16:41.080 align:start position:0%
Windam New Hampshire I began educating
 
06:16:44.670 --> 06:16:44.680 align:start position:0%
my children onto RSA 193a over 20 years
 
06:16:47.150 --> 06:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
ago it is my opinion that all children
 
06:16:50.390 --> 06:16:50.400 align:start position:0%
should be protected but this bill is not
 
06:16:52.830 --> 06:16:52.840 align:start position:0%
the means to achieve that result and I
 
06:16:56.110 --> 06:16:56.120 align:start position:0%
ask you to vote itl on it this is the
 
06:16:58.150 --> 06:16:58.160 align:start position:0%
third attempt to introduce a criminal
 
06:17:00.548 --> 06:17:00.558 align:start position:0%
background check bill on Home
 
06:17:02.750 --> 06:17:02.760 align:start position:0%
Educators last session we listened to
 
06:17:05.310 --> 06:17:05.320 align:start position:0%
three hours of testimony and link the
 
06:17:07.230 --> 06:17:07.240 align:start position:0%
executive session filled with expert
 
06:17:11.230 --> 06:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
Witnesses for HB 628 the previous
 
06:17:14.430 --> 06:17:14.440 align:start position:0%
iteration of today's bill it was clear
 
06:17:17.190 --> 06:17:17.200 align:start position:0%
that HB 628 created more problems than
 
06:17:21.468 --> 06:17:21.478 align:start position:0%
it solved just as HB 738 would this
 
06:17:24.270 --> 06:17:24.280 align:start position:0%
bill's target has not
 
06:17:26.390 --> 06:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
changed today you'll hear plenty of
 
06:17:28.948 --> 06:17:28.958 align:start position:0%
testimony about the right to privacy
 
06:17:32.190 --> 06:17:32.200 align:start position:0%
government overreach and parental rights
 
06:17:35.350 --> 06:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
but I ask you the following if we know
 
06:17:37.190 --> 06:17:37.200 align:start position:0%
through the hearings on HB
 
06:17:40.830 --> 06:17:40.840 align:start position:0%
628 that expert Witnesses testified on
 
06:17:42.788 --> 06:17:42.798 align:start position:0%
the existing procedures for criminal
 
06:17:46.390 --> 06:17:46.400 align:start position:0%
background checks the type the depth and
 
06:17:49.030 --> 06:17:49.040 align:start position:0%
the many kinds that can be used and if
 
06:17:50.590 --> 06:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
we know that criminal background checks
 
06:17:52.750 --> 06:17:52.760 align:start position:0%
are already being used in the non-public
 
06:17:56.350 --> 06:17:56.360 align:start position:0%
schools the dases of Manchester prena
 
06:17:58.468 --> 06:17:58.478 align:start position:0%
and the EFA through testimony and
 
06:18:00.868 --> 06:18:00.878 align:start position:0%
documentation that was clearly presented
 
06:18:01.948 --> 06:18:01.958 align:start position:0%
during that
 
06:18:06.190 --> 06:18:06.200 align:start position:0%
session and if we know that h B 738 does
 
06:18:08.830 --> 06:18:08.840 align:start position:0%
not address the administrative aspects
 
06:18:11.510 --> 06:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
of this proposal it does not address
 
06:18:13.910 --> 06:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
What entity would administer this it
 
06:18:17.868 --> 06:18:17.878 align:start position:0%
does not address who orders receives or
 
06:18:20.788 --> 06:18:20.798 align:start position:0%
views these background checks or who
 
06:18:23.510 --> 06:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
Bears the expense of these checks or how
 
06:18:26.390 --> 06:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
much this will cost the state then we
 
06:18:28.190 --> 06:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
have to question the motivation for
 
06:18:30.830 --> 06:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
revisiting a bill that has failed twice
 
06:18:33.708 --> 06:18:33.718 align:start position:0%
already and returns without
 
06:18:36.628 --> 06:18:36.638 align:start position:0%
revisions it is false to say that this
 
06:18:39.548 --> 06:18:39.558 align:start position:0%
bill does not impact Home Educators We
 
06:18:42.590 --> 06:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
join in co-ops and many other group

in New Hampshire for many
 
06:19:52.590 --> 06:19:52.600 align:start position:0%
years I would respectfully like to add
 
06:19:55.670 --> 06:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
my voice to those who uh speak in Oppo
 
06:19:57.390 --> 06:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
opposition to House Bill
 
06:20:00.230 --> 06:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
738 House Bill 738 would unnecessarily
 
06:20:02.510 --> 06:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
burden many homeschooling parents
 
06:20:04.788 --> 06:20:04.798 align:start position:0%
homeschool co-ops with additional costs
 
06:20:07.190 --> 06:20:07.200 align:start position:0%
regulation red tap red tape by
 
06:20:09.110 --> 06:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
subjecting them to Ed criminal
 
06:20:10.868 --> 06:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
background checks simply for educating
 
06:20:12.910 --> 06:20:12.920 align:start position:0%
their children and participating in
 
06:20:14.708 --> 06:20:14.718 align:start position:0%
homeschool groups providing Educational
 
06:20:17.510 --> 06:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
Services to their own children even if
 
06:20:19.468 --> 06:20:19.478 align:start position:0%
that homeschool family did not accept
 
06:20:21.030 --> 06:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
public funds they would be required to
 
06:20:23.230 --> 06:20:23.240 align:start position:0%
obtain criminal background checks simply
 
06:20:25.310 --> 06:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
for volunteering at that homeschooling
 
06:20:28.110 --> 06:20:28.120 align:start position:0%
Co-op that does accept students who have
 
06:20:29.628 --> 06:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
received those public
 
06:20:33.350 --> 06:20:33.360 align:start position:0%
funds to speak about the amendment uh it
 
06:20:35.628 --> 06:20:35.638 align:start position:0%
only addresses one section that speaks
 
06:20:37.150 --> 06:20:37.160 align:start position:0%
there as we've already been mentioned
 
06:20:39.070 --> 06:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
here two other sections of this bill
 
06:20:40.948 --> 06:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
would would also capture these
 
06:20:44.110 --> 06:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
homeschool students so even if that
 
06:20:45.750 --> 06:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment were to pass uh we would still
 
06:20:48.190 --> 06:20:48.200 align:start position:0%
be in opposition to this bill New
 
06:20:49.628 --> 06:20:49.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire already has some very strong
 
06:20:51.910 --> 06:20:51.920 align:start position:0%
laws to protect children it imposes
 
06:20:53.788 --> 06:20:53.798 align:start position:0%
strong severe penalties on those who
 
06:20:56.310 --> 06:20:56.320 align:start position:0%
harm children as a previously
 
06:20:57.548 --> 06:20:57.558 align:start position:0%
homeschooled student and as a
 
06:20:59.548 --> 06:20:59.558 align:start position:0%
homeschooled father myself I can speak
 
06:21:02.150 --> 06:21:02.160 align:start position:0%
from my own personal experience most
 
06:21:04.270 --> 06:21:04.280 align:start position:0%
homeschool co-ops have a comprehensive
 
06:21:05.830 --> 06:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
polic and procedures to protect their
 
06:21:08.310 --> 06:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
children most parents are present when
 
06:21:10.030 --> 06:21:10.040 align:start position:0%
their children are being educated I
 
06:21:12.910 --> 06:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
myself am a homeschool teacher at our
 
06:21:15.270 --> 06:21:15.280 align:start position:0%
local home school co-op in my home state
 
06:21:17.910 --> 06:21:17.920 align:start position:0%
where I currently live with my family as
 
06:21:19.788 --> 06:21:19.798 align:start position:0%
parents we want our children to be safe
 
06:21:21.788 --> 06:21:21.798 align:start position:0%
we're actively involved in monitoring
 
06:21:23.030 --> 06:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
who teaches our
 
06:21:25.788 --> 06:21:25.798 align:start position:0%
children House Bill 738 assumes that
 
06:21:27.708 --> 06:21:27.718 align:start position:0%
parents can't be trusted to protect
 
06:21:29.788 --> 06:21:29.798 align:start position:0%
their own children by mandating that
 
06:21:30.830 --> 06:21:30.840 align:start position:0%
that Homeschool Group that they
 
06:21:32.510 --> 06:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
participate in must require criminal
 
06:21:34.230 --> 06:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
background checks even from those who
 
06:21:34.240 --> 06:21:35.310 align:start position:0%
background checks even from those who
volun

06:21:35.310 --> 06:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
volun
 
06:21:37.390 --> 06:21:37.400 align:start position:0%
here with all respect to this committee
 
06:21:39.628 --> 06:21:39.638 align:start position:0%
and to its members requiring parents to
 
06:21:41.830 --> 06:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
obtain that criminal background checks
 
06:21:43.708 --> 06:21:43.718 align:start position:0%
to Volunteers in a group educational
 
06:21:45.910 --> 06:21:45.920 align:start position:0%
activity is insulting it certainly
 
06:21:48.030 --> 06:21:48.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't live up to our M motto to live
 
06:21:51.270 --> 06:21:51.280 align:start position:0%
free please oppose house spell
 
06:21:54.990 --> 06:21:55.000 align:start position:0%

representative B Bon thank you madam
 
06:21:59.030 --> 06:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
06:22:01.150 --> 06:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
question um you mentioned that
 
06:22:02.948 --> 06:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
homeschool cooperatives do have
 
06:22:06.310 --> 06:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
procedures in place uh to ensure that
 
06:22:08.190 --> 06:22:08.200 align:start position:0%
your children are safe I was just
 
06:22:10.270 --> 06:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
wondering because I I'm not aware of
 
06:22:11.910 --> 06:22:11.920 align:start position:0%
those and I'm just curious if you could
 
06:22:13.910 --> 06:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
share some of those with us well I can
 
06:22:15.150 --> 06:22:15.160 align:start position:0%
only speak from my own personal
 
06:22:16.310 --> 06:22:16.320 align:start position:0%
experience and thank you for your
 
06:22:18.750 --> 06:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
question um I I would say for the co-op
 
06:22:20.230 --> 06:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
that I've participated in and the ones
 
06:22:21.788 --> 06:22:21.798 align:start position:0%
that you know that I'm currently
 
06:22:24.030 --> 06:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
participating in we have a requirement
 
06:22:26.230 --> 06:22:26.240 align:start position:0%
that any teacher who's teaching a child
 
06:22:27.750 --> 06:22:27.760 align:start position:0%
have someone else there present and
 
06:22:31.350 --> 06:22:31.360 align:start position:0%
another adult that no parent uh and our
 
06:22:33.948 --> 06:22:33.958 align:start position:0%
Co-op requires parents to participate in
 
06:22:35.708 --> 06:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
teaching if their child goes to the
 
06:22:38.350 --> 06:22:38.360 align:start position:0%
co-op they're required to participate uh
 
06:22:40.110 --> 06:22:40.120 align:start position:0%
and if they're not able to be there they
 
06:22:43.270 --> 06:22:43.280 align:start position:0%
have to make allowance for that so in in
 
06:22:44.788 --> 06:22:44.798 align:start position:0%
the co-op that I currently participate
 
06:22:47.468 --> 06:22:47.478 align:start position:0%
in at least two adults must be present
 
06:22:49.230 --> 06:22:49.240 align:start position:0%
whenever children no children is allowed
 
06:22:51.750 --> 06:22:51.760 align:start position:0%
to be alone with an adult who's teaching
 
06:22:53.070 --> 06:22:53.080 align:start position:0%
we also have other policies and
 
06:22:55.190 --> 06:22:55.200 align:start position:0%
requirements I know some policies
 
06:22:57.948 --> 06:22:57.958 align:start position:0%
require background checks uh but in each
 
06:22:59.548 --> 06:22:59.558 align:start position:0%
homeschool Co-op that I've participated
 
06:23:03.030 --> 06:23:03.040 align:start position:0%

educator in the state of New Hampshire

my family lives in barington and and the
 
06:24:38.628 --> 06:24:38.638 align:start position:0%
um education tax credit scholarship is
 
06:24:40.990 --> 06:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
something that my family participates in
 
06:24:44.990 --> 06:24:45.000 align:start position:0%
this bill itself ropes my family in when
 
06:24:46.548 --> 06:24:46.558 align:start position:0%
I accept the education tax credit
 
06:24:49.868 --> 06:24:49.878 align:start position:0%
scholarship I do not compromise my 193a
 
06:24:52.670 --> 06:24:52.680 align:start position:0%
status making an amendment that does not
 
06:24:54.910 --> 06:24:54.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate the tax credit scholarship
 
06:24:57.628 --> 06:24:57.638 align:start position:0%
still leaves homeschoolers as defined by
 
06:24:57.638 --> 06:24:59.150 align:start position:0%
still leaves homeschoolers as defined by
193a

06:24:59.150 --> 06:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
193a
 
06:25:05.390 --> 06:25:05.400 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:07.430 --> 06:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
this bill would directly affect me in
 
06:25:07.440 --> 06:25:08.868 align:start position:0%
this bill would directly affect me in
any

06:25:08.868 --> 06:25:08.878 align:start position:0%
any
 
06:25:11.110 --> 06:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
instances even if I wasn't a home
 
06:25:13.230 --> 06:25:13.240 align:start position:0%
educator if I was a
 
06:25:16.350 --> 06:25:16.360 align:start position:0%
volunteer in a homeschool Co-op I've
 
06:25:17.788 --> 06:25:17.798 align:start position:0%
participated in co-ops in the past where
 
06:25:19.948 --> 06:25:19.958 align:start position:0%
we've had people come in and teach
 
06:25:22.548 --> 06:25:22.558 align:start position:0%
something we didn't pay them to teach
 
06:25:23.990 --> 06:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
they came and taught out of their base
 
06:25:24.000 --> 06:25:24.670 align:start position:0%
they came and taught out of their base
of

06:25:24.670 --> 06:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
of
 
06:25:28.350 --> 06:25:28.360 align:start position:0%
knowledge as um Mr Schmidt already said
 
06:25:30.390 --> 06:25:30.400 align:start position:0%
the co-ops that I've participated in
 
06:25:32.430 --> 06:25:32.440 align:start position:0%
it's the parents that are leading it
 
06:25:34.750 --> 06:25:34.760 align:start position:0%
it's the parents that are there um
 
06:25:36.468 --> 06:25:36.478 align:start position:0%
and everything that I've ever done has
 
06:25:38.788 --> 06:25:38.798 align:start position:0%
fallen under that we call it to deep
 
06:25:40.390 --> 06:25:40.400 align:start position:0%
leadership where there are two adults in
 
06:25:43.750 --> 06:25:43.760 align:start position:0%
the room unrelated so it can't be
 
06:25:46.628 --> 06:25:46.638 align:start position:0%
anything um where it's uh questioned as
 
06:25:48.030 --> 06:25:48.040 align:start position:0%
to whether or not something did happen
 
06:25:49.350 --> 06:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
or didn't
 
06:25:49.360 --> 06:25:54.030 align:start position:0%
or didn't
happen

06:25:54.030 --> 06:25:54.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:57.230 --> 06:25:57.240 align:start position:0%
the responsibility to make sure my
 
06:25:58.430 --> 06:25:58.440 align:start position:0%
children are
 
06:26:00.708 --> 06:26:00.718 align:start position:0%
safe is
 
06:26:04.030 --> 06:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
mine I don't need the state to be
 
06:26:05.670 --> 06:26:05.680 align:start position:0%
involved in that
 
06:26:07.468 --> 06:26:07.478 align:start position:0%
process this
 
06:26:09.910 --> 06:26:09.920 align:start position:0%
bill requires me to involve the state in
 
06:26:09.920 --> 06:26:11.948 align:start position:0%
bill requires me to involve the state in
that

06:26:11.948 --> 06:26:11.958 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:26:14.670 --> 06:26:14.680 align:start position:0%
process I've personally passed several
 
06:26:16.468 --> 06:26:16.478 align:start position:0%
criminal background checks for different
 
06:26:18.030 --> 06:26:18.040 align:start position:0%
organizations that I have to volunteer
 
06:26:20.590 --> 06:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
in or that I choose to volunteer in that
 
06:26:22.110 --> 06:26:22.120 align:start position:0%
require the background
 
06:26:25.070 --> 06:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
check I choose to participate in those
 
06:26:26.948 --> 06:26:26.958 align:start position:0%
organizations and I choose to submit to
 
06:26:28.310 --> 06:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
a criminal background
 
06:26:30.868 --> 06:26:30.878 align:start position:0%
check this eliminates the
 
06:26:34.590 --> 06:26:34.600 align:start position:0%
choice for anyone and as our already has
 
06:26:36.990 --> 06:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
been stated and as I've stated at the
 
06:26:38.788 --> 06:26:38.798 align:start position:0%

in Dover um we fall under the 183a
 
06:27:19.990 --> 06:27:20.000 align:start position:0%
statute um I came here today to express
 
06:27:21.868 --> 06:27:21.878 align:start position:0%
my opposition to this
 
06:27:24.750 --> 06:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
bill um I like to Echo a lot of the
 
06:27:26.628 --> 06:27:26.638 align:start position:0%
concerns that have already been brought
 
06:27:29.948 --> 06:27:29.958 align:start position:0%
up in opposition to this bill um but I
 
06:27:31.510 --> 06:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
won't to sayfe time I won't reiterate
 
06:27:34.390 --> 06:27:34.400 align:start position:0%
all these very valid concerns um I hope
 
06:27:35.868 --> 06:27:35.878 align:start position:0%
they came through clear to
 
06:27:35.878 --> 06:27:37.510 align:start position:0%
they came through clear to
you

06:27:37.510 --> 06:27:37.520 align:start position:0%
you
 
06:27:41.030 --> 06:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
um so I came here to ask that you vote I
 
06:27:43.830 --> 06:27:43.840 align:start position:0%
on this bill and upon arrival I learned
 
06:27:45.270 --> 06:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
there was an amendment to try to address
 
06:27:46.548 --> 06:27:46.558 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns of homeschool
 
06:27:48.390 --> 06:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
families unfortunately I haven't read
 
06:27:51.468 --> 06:27:51.478 align:start position:0%
this amendment but uh upon hearing the
 
06:27:53.030 --> 06:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
responses of Representative Leno to a
 
06:27:55.190 --> 06:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
lot of the questions from this committee
 
06:27:58.948 --> 06:27:58.958 align:start position:0%
I realized that um it's still fall short
 
06:28:00.310 --> 06:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
of addressing our
 
06:28:00.320 --> 06:28:02.910 align:start position:0%
of addressing our
concerns

06:28:02.910 --> 06:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
06:28:05.070 --> 06:28:05.080 align:start position:0%
and um
 
06:28:06.990 --> 06:28:07.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me a
 
06:28:10.150 --> 06:28:10.160 align:start position:0%
minute uh still exposes us to a lot of
 
06:28:12.430 --> 06:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
the uh overreach that we are concerned
 
06:28:16.230 --> 06:28:16.240 align:start position:0%
about um as homeschool families in our
 
06:28:17.910 --> 06:28:17.920 align:start position:0%
family's educational
 
06:28:21.270 --> 06:28:21.280 align:start position:0%
choices um so I just like to ask you to
 
06:28:23.990 --> 06:28:24.000 align:start position:0%
vote it on this bill even with the
 
06:28:27.110 --> 06:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
amendment if it were to pass as it is
 
06:28:28.948 --> 06:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
unnecessary for what we're trying to do
 
06:28:31.350 --> 06:28:31.360 align:start position:0%
