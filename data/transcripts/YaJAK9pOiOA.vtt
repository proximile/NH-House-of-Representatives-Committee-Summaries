for the record uh my name is Joseph
 
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 align:start position:0%
Malik I'm the chairman of the New
 
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor Commission with me is
 
00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 align:start position:0%
our CEO James Vera I'd just like to say
 
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
that I have informed the governor of
 
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
this model I had a meeting with the
 
00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
governor on this model and didn't inform
 
00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 align:start position:0%
him and he's fully informed that we're
 
00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
going to testify on it today the New
 
00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor Commission does not
 
00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
take a position on this and we're here
 
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.010 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
starting on page one
 
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
you'll notice that we're calling this a
 
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 align:start position:0%
franchise model because that's what it
 
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.910 align:start position:0%
franchise model because that's what it
is

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
on page two the introduction is just
 
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 align:start position:0%
to give you some history of the New
 
00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor Commission our primary
 
00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 align:start position:0%
duels rules our and Duties are under
 
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
176.3 to optimize profitability maintain
 
00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 align:start position:0%
proper controls and assume
 
00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 align:start position:0%
responsibility for an effective and
 
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 align:start position:0%
efficient operation of the Liquor
 
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 align:start position:0%
Commission and you can see that in 2022
 
00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 align:start position:0%
we generated over 771 million dollars in
 
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.149 align:start position:0%
we generated over 771 million dollars in
Revenue

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
take you to page three just a simple
 
00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 align:start position:0%
graph of our Revenue since our Inception
 
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
95 years ago that we've put over four
 
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 align:start position:0%
and a half billion dollars into the
 
00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 align:start position:0%
general fund you can see that since
 
00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
covid we've had a little drop off
 
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 align:start position:0%
uh just some historical perspective
 
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 align:start position:0%
there as the Baby Boomers drop out of
 
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 align:start position:0%
the alcohol control Market uh this the
 
00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
sales in general across the states
 
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
you're seeing the oldest Boomers at 77
 
00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 align:start position:0%
the youngest Boomers at 59. it's a big
 
00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 align:start position:0%
segment of the liquor Market that's
 
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 align:start position:0%
moving out of the market so we're seeing
 
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe this information will come
 
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to sales of liquor to
 
00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 align:start position:0%
out-of-state residents or or out of
 
00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
state customers do you have any idea
 
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
what the perhaps percentages to
 
00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 align:start position:0%
out-of-state consumers shorts it's a
 
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
little over 50 percent and we're
 
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
actually in the process we haven't done
 
00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
a full survey since 2014 or in the
 
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 align:start position:0%
process of doing another full survey now
 
00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 align:start position:0%
it's a little over 50 percent
 
00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 align:start position:0%
cross-border sales
 
00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 align:start position:0%
I follow a question about you I'm sorry
 
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 align:start position:0%
thank you sorry to stop you so early
 
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
um but there's a big number on page two
 
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 align:start position:0%
that the commission had generated a
 
00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money in net sales
 
00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.330 align:start position:0%
substantial amount of money in net sales
and

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 align:start position:0%
um so I'm just curious of of that number
 
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 align:start position:0%
of net sales what was actually
 
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
transferred to the general fund and
 
00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 align:start position:0%
other funds in terms of Revenue back to
 
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:04.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 align:start position:0%
so you'll see on page four that where
 
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 align:start position:0%
the revenue sources come from liquor and
 
00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 align:start position:0%
wine Revenue sources restaurants Lounge
 
00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 align:start position:0%
grocery stores
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
the beer tax and permits and the other
 
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 align:start position:0%
Revenue which is fees including some
 
00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
miscellaneous Lottery Revenue
 
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
on page five you'll see the
 
00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 align:start position:0%
organizational structure of the Liquor
 
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 align:start position:0%
Commission the office of the commission
 
00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 align:start position:0%
the division of enforcement the number
 
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
of people in the enforcement division
 
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
the administrative Division and the
 
00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:40.099 align:start position:0%
marketing Division and those 298 people
 
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
about 260 of those folks are in our
 
00:03:47.089 --> 00:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
stores in our Outlets
 
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 align:start position:0%
so we can see down the bottom a little
 
00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
the divisions UH responsibilities you've
 
00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
got the office of the commission I won't
 
00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
read the responsibilities you've got the
 
00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
division of enforcement the division of
 
00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 align:start position:0%
administration and the division of
 
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 align:start position:0%
marketing basically we run an 800

business comes from cross-border our
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
major competitors Total Wine and Spirits
 
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
uh they moved into Massachusetts in
 
00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 align:start position:0%
2016. they now have seven locations in
 
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Massachusetts is their
 
00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 align:start position:0%
fastest growing state every one of their
 
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:30.900 align:start position:0%
locations save one is inside the 495
 
00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.110 align:start position:0%
locations save one is inside the 495
Beltway

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 align:start position:0%
Beltway
 
00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
they are in
 
00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:37.400 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
243 stores in 24 States so they are the
 
00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 align:start position:0%
largest private liquor and wine retailer
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
in the United States and that is our
 
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
major competition they're owned by Two
 
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500 align:start position:0%

Virginia
 
00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 align:start position:0%
just as a little FYI
 
00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 align:start position:0%
our 65 retail outlet locations as you
 
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 align:start position:0%
can see
 
00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 align:start position:0%
across the state you can see that we
 
00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 align:start position:0%
purposely put them along the border we
 
00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 align:start position:0%
track them along the southern part of
 
00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.390 align:start position:0%
the state
and

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 align:start position:0%
we also have three agency stores one in
 
00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220 align:start position:0%
Greenville one in Pittsburgh and one in
 
00:05:24.249 --> 00:05:24.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
if you still mind explaining when you
 
00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 align:start position:0%
say agency store me to explain what
 
00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 align:start position:0%
exactly the agency towards the door
 
00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
an agency stores a licensee where the
 
00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 align:start position:0%
commission has felt there hasn't been an
 
00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:38.100 align:start position:0%
agency store licensed since
 
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.390 align:start position:0%
agency store licensed since
2002.03

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:44.039 align:start position:0%
03 there hasn't been an agency store
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
license put out
 
00:05:49.129 --> 00:05:49.139 align:start position:0%
um an agency stores someone that buys
 
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 align:start position:0%
their product directly from the
 
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 align:start position:0%
commission at wholesale and sells to the
 
00:05:56.749 --> 00:05:56.759 align:start position:0%
general public with a markup that they
 
00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 align:start position:0%
deem is responsible for the area that
 
00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:04.280 align:start position:0%
they are in so we do not oversee
 
00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:07.620 align:start position:0%
the profits that an agency store makes
 
00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:10.139 align:start position:0%
they're allowed to mark up uh whatever
 
00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:12.840 align:start position:0%
they they deem necessary they cannot
 
00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:16.100 align:start position:0%
undersell the Commission in what they do
 
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
and given that there's only three of
 
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
them I think they do around two and a
 
00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
half million dollars collectively all
 
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:25.800 align:start position:0%
three stores with the model that we've
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
put in place since I've been at the
 
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
Commission in 2010 uh creating a brand
 
00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:34.259 align:start position:0%
creating a look and feel uh we don't
 
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 align:start position:0%
necessarily feel that that's something
 
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:38.580 align:start position:0%
that we need to do on the liquor side of
 
00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:40.919 align:start position:0%
the business but it's out there and it
 
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:43.500 align:start position:0%
certainly works
 
00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
you can see with the alcohol system we
 
00:06:47.749 --> 00:06:47.759 align:start position:0%
have the three-tier system is in place
 
00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
manufacturers are there we have Brokers
 
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:54.780 align:start position:0%
and wholesalers in the state and the
 
00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
obviously the Liquor Commission is the
 
00:06:56.580 --> 00:06:58.790 align:start position:0%
obviously the Liquor Commission is the
retailer

00:06:58.790 --> 00:06:58.800 align:start position:0%
retailer
 
00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:02.340 align:start position:0%
so now we'll get into on page nine uh
 
00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
the idea of recreational adult use
 
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:08.600 align:start position:0%
cannabis framework so we have Growers
 
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 align:start position:0%
Growers can take on many looks and feels
 
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 align:start position:0%
from small farm Growers to large
 
00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:19.080 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse Growers and everything in
 
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:20.290 align:start position:0%
Greenhouse Growers and everything in
between

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:20.300 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:22.860 align:start position:0%
manufacturing is the manufacturing of
 
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:27.060 align:start position:0%
edible products the dabs the Vapes the
 
00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:28.010 align:start position:0%
edible products the dabs the Vapes the
gummies

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:28.020 align:start position:0%
gummies
 
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:29.089 align:start position:0%
gummies
Etc

00:07:29.089 --> 00:07:29.099 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
and what the model that we are looking
 
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 align:start position:0%
to put into place that we feel would be
 
00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.160 align:start position:0%
feasible is that the Liquor Commission
 
00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
would be the franchisor
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
and the franchisee would be the retailer
 
00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:46.919 align:start position:0%
much like any other franchise system
 
00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
that we set up
 
00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
across the country be it a McDonald's
 
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.080 align:start position:0%
via Dunkin Donuts be it Whatever It Is
 
00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
there'd be a certain look and feel
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
and we would I'll get into it further
 
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
but we would oversee and organize that
 
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
look and feel as well as all the safety
 
00:08:10.670 --> 00:08:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:13.909 --> 00:08:13.919 align:start position:0%
so on page 10 you'll see the additional
 
00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
uh number of uh people that we feel the
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission would need we'd need
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
an additional 10 people in the division
 
00:08:24.230 --> 00:08:24.240 align:start position:0%
of enforcement for obviously licensing
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
education and enforcement some
 
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
additional people in finance under the
 
00:08:32.089 --> 00:08:32.099 align:start position:0%
director of administration Human
 
00:08:36.350 --> 00:08:36.360 align:start position:0%
Resources auditing I.T and legal and
 
00:08:37.969 --> 00:08:37.979 align:start position:0%
some people in the marketing and
 
00:08:41.089 --> 00:08:41.099 align:start position:0%
Merchandising because as the franchisor
 
00:08:44.449 --> 00:08:44.459 align:start position:0%
we will take on all the marketing and
 
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
the message that's put out to the public
 
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:52.140 align:start position:0%
so and the main thing that we feel that
 
00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
we need to do is obviously from a
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
federal standpoint we're we're
 
00:08:59.870 --> 00:08:59.880 align:start position:0%
separating the two businesses they're
 
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:01.920 align:start position:0%
going to be run completely separate
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to be marketed completely
 
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
separately and the look and feel in some
 
00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:11.940 align:start position:0%
in some instances would be similar but
 
00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:13.380 align:start position:0%
they would not take on the same
 
00:09:16.449 --> 00:09:16.459 align:start position:0%
structure where we would put
 
00:09:20.329 --> 00:09:20.339 align:start position:0%
state employees into these stores to
 
00:09:23.269 --> 00:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
actually run the stores
 
00:09:28.310 --> 00:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:35.170 --> 00:09:35.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:37.550 --> 00:09:37.560 align:start position:0%
under your structure
 
00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:40.140 align:start position:0%
this is not going to be in the liquid
 
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%
store itself it's going to be a
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
freestanding facility is that's the way
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
you're seeing it well I can in the next
 
00:09:49.009 --> 00:09:49.019 align:start position:0%
couple of pages representative I'll get
 
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:52.019 align:start position:0%
into the idea of of how we're going to
 
00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
look at it as from a business standpoint
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
but that's correct you made a comment
 
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:01.920 align:start position:0%
about separating any thought twice sure
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the finance division will be
 
00:10:07.550 --> 00:10:07.560 align:start position:0%
completely separated the marketing
 
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
division will be completely separated
 
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:11.700 align:start position:0%
the enforcement division will be
 
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
completely separated they'll fall under
 
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:16.260 align:start position:0%
the umbrellas that we now have in place
 
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
but a liquor investigator will not do
 
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:21.720 align:start position:0%
cannabis work there'll be two separate
 
00:10:26.509 --> 00:10:26.519 align:start position:0%
investigators uh an auditor of cannabis
 
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
will not be an auditor of liquor a
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
marketing person of liquor will not be a
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
marketing person of cannabis they will
 
00:10:35.329 --> 00:10:35.339 align:start position:0%
be completely separated
 
00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:40.560 align:start position:0%
and follow up on that oh so you also
 
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
indicated in order to uh sidestep or to
 
00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
avoid uh confrontation with Federal uh
 
00:10:54.889 --> 00:10:54.899 align:start position:0%
um things put it easily
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
what's the Genesis of that if you could
 
00:10:59.630 --> 00:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
please her
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
well the Genesis is uh is basically the
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
the law itself if the federal government
 
00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:09.240 align:start position:0%
ever has an issue with cannabis in any
 
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
way shape or form beyond what we've seen
 
00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:14.880 align:start position:0%
now and we've seen very little uh we
 
00:11:16.490 --> 00:11:16.500 align:start position:0%
certainly wouldn't want them to close
 
00:11:19.190 --> 00:11:19.200 align:start position:0%
down the liquor business okay because we
 
00:11:21.829 --> 00:11:21.839 align:start position:0%
were in the Cannabis business we wanted
 
00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:24.060 align:start position:0%
we would want those to remain completely
 
00:11:27.949 --> 00:11:27.959 align:start position:0%
separate and and with all due respect oh
 
00:11:30.290 --> 00:11:30.300 align:start position:0%
I'm not looking at I'm looking at as a
 
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:33.480 align:start position:0%
as a preemptive business move rather
 
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
than anything else yeah that's that's
 
00:11:38.329 --> 00:11:38.339 align:start position:0%
fine representative kale
 
00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:40.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question sure
 
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:43.440 align:start position:0%
marijuana is federally illegal correct
 
00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:56.269 --> 00:11:56.279 align:start position:0%
um you might
 
00:11:59.329 --> 00:11:59.339 align:start position:0%
um is it possible that we could get a a
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
uh our cost of these uh 29 people 30
 
00:12:06.889 --> 00:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
people sure I believe we had some costs
 
00:12:09.769 --> 00:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
in the original legislation but yeah
 
00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:12.300 align:start position:0%
just just sure break it up off the top
 
00:12:14.329 --> 00:12:14.339 align:start position:0%
of my head I don't know no no that's
 
00:12:16.490 --> 00:12:16.500 align:start position:0%
certainly your job certainly something
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
that we can do I wasn't looking at
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
yourself yeah thank you yeah certainly
 
00:12:22.449 --> 00:12:22.459 align:start position:0%
happy to do that
 
00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh yeah thanks for taking my question so
 
00:12:27.949 --> 00:12:27.959 align:start position:0%
you said in the in the people working in
 
00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:29.579 align:start position:0%
the stores would not be state employees
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
that's correct so the only view the
 
00:12:33.430 --> 00:12:33.440 align:start position:0%
people in the administrative structure
 
00:12:37.250 --> 00:12:37.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement division marketing Division
 
00:12:39.949 --> 00:12:39.959 align:start position:0%
and administration Division and the
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
people in the stores would be the
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the franchisee okay so
 
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
just like any other franchise it sounds
 
00:12:49.009 --> 00:12:49.019 align:start position:0%
good you have a home headquarters the
 
00:12:50.930 --> 00:12:50.940 align:start position:0%
stores are a responsibility of the
 
00:12:53.930 --> 00:12:53.940 align:start position:0%
franchisee any of the uh business that
 
00:12:56.389 --> 00:12:56.399 align:start position:0%
goes on under the roof of that under
 
00:12:58.190 --> 00:12:58.200 align:start position:0%
that business this is the responsibility
 
00:13:01.850 --> 00:13:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:03.530 --> 00:13:03.540 align:start position:0%
I'd like to ask one question about sure
 
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:05.760 align:start position:0%
it came to when it comes to the liquor
 
00:13:08.329 --> 00:13:08.339 align:start position:0%
investigate Gators and you know we'll
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
just call it when the Cannabis
 
00:13:11.269 --> 00:13:11.279 align:start position:0%
investigators for now what's the
 
00:13:12.590 --> 00:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
rationale to keep I understand keeping
 
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
the finances separate but how why keep
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
the enforcement separate
 
00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:19.320 align:start position:0%
the there's a completely different level
 
00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
of expertise in what we're looking at
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
so that would be the reason different
 
00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
training different uh rationale of
 
00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:29.100 align:start position:0%
business and and different level of
 
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:31.730 align:start position:0%
business and and different level of
expertise

00:13:31.730 --> 00:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:34.500 align:start position:0%
thank you you're welcome
 
00:13:36.769 --> 00:13:36.779 align:start position:0%
generally so feel free to tell me you're
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
going to cover this later but so I I
 
00:13:40.850 --> 00:13:40.860 align:start position:0%
under the franchisees model and the
 
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:43.860 align:start position:0%
private employees does that extend the
 
00:13:45.889 --> 00:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
AG to be able to defend if the federal
 
00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
government came in any employee was
 
00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:49.380 align:start position:0%
charged a distribution under a federal
 
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.230 align:start position:0%
charged a distribution under a federal
model

00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
model
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
um it's a private business so no so no
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
the AG would not be able to defend the
 
00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040 align:start position:0%
state's position of legalized cannabis
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry we wouldn't be able to defend
 
00:14:04.970 --> 00:14:04.980 align:start position:0%
an employee of a franchise absent
 
00:14:07.190 --> 00:14:07.200 align:start position:0%
um it being a state employee that's
 
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.009 align:start position:0%
um it being a state employee that's
correct

00:14:09.009 --> 00:14:09.019 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:14:11.569 --> 00:14:11.579 align:start position:0%
and just I know the Federal
 
00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:13.500 align:start position:0%
prohibitions have always been a big
 
00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:16.019 align:start position:0%
talking point if the federal government
 
00:14:18.050 --> 00:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
decides to
 
00:14:20.269 --> 00:14:20.279 align:start position:0%
now enforce this particular federal law
 
00:14:21.829 --> 00:14:21.839 align:start position:0%
and only targets the state of New
 
00:14:25.430 --> 00:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that would be a very odd I
 
00:14:26.810 --> 00:14:26.820 align:start position:0%
mean how many I don't have it on top of
 
00:14:28.129 --> 00:14:28.139 align:start position:0%
my head how many states are doing the
 
00:14:30.110 --> 00:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
therapeutic programs already and how
 
00:14:31.550 --> 00:14:31.560 align:start position:0%
many states have done retail already I
 
00:14:33.829 --> 00:14:33.839 align:start position:0%
mean California Oregon Washington's
 
00:14:36.350 --> 00:14:36.360 align:start position:0%
entire strip of the length of the
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
country and they're all doing Recreation
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
and therapeutic so if they're going to
 
00:14:41.629 --> 00:14:41.639 align:start position:0%
start here in New Hampshire
 
00:14:43.370 --> 00:14:43.380 align:start position:0%
I would find that to be odd and be
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
curious why they took that road so I
 
00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:46.980 align:start position:0%
think which I understand what the
 
00:14:49.009 --> 00:14:49.019 align:start position:0%
federal law is but maybe we've
 
00:14:50.449 --> 00:14:50.459 align:start position:0%
I understand the purpose of the
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
presentation that comes up but we all
 
00:14:53.569 --> 00:14:53.579 align:start position:0%
know it's against federal law it's
 
00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:55.740 align:start position:0%
against the federal law and we're
 
00:14:58.550 --> 00:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
carrying on for despite that
 
00:14:58.560 --> 00:15:06.490 align:start position:0%
carrying on for despite that
foreign

00:15:06.490 --> 00:15:06.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:08.399 align:start position:0%
we're not the first state that's
 
00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
considered doing this so when we look at
 
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:13.980 align:start position:0%
these models we're absolutely looking in
 
00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:17.100 align:start position:0%
other states so in this case uh if you
 
00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:18.740 align:start position:0%
were to look at a government
 
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:21.420 align:start position:0%
inter-involved in regulating marijuana
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
let's say Washington State or Oregon
 
00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:25.129 align:start position:0%
let's say Washington State or Oregon
State

00:15:25.129 --> 00:15:25.139 align:start position:0%
State
 
00:15:27.470 --> 00:15:27.480 align:start position:0%
um absolutely they have these same you
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
know enforcement divisions they have all
 
00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:31.680 align:start position:0%
the same same things you know they might
 
00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.420 align:start position:0%
have the the product has been sold
 
00:15:35.329 --> 00:15:35.339 align:start position:0%
licensing is regulated differently but
 
00:15:37.430 --> 00:15:37.440 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day there's the same
 
00:15:46.189 --> 00:15:46.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:50.509 --> 00:15:50.519 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so on page 11
 
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:52.940 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis Growers and manufacturers
 
00:15:56.210 --> 00:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
facilities shall be New Hampshire based
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
and operated just like they are in any
 
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
other state
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
what what's grown in the state what's
 
00:16:03.949 --> 00:16:03.959 align:start position:0%
manufactured in the state stays in the
 
00:16:07.370 --> 00:16:07.380 align:start position:0%
state no cross-border as far as the
 
00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:09.360 align:start position:0%
growing or manufacturing is concerned
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
Cannabis Testing this is done in a lot
 
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
of states is done by a third party
 
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
individual it's done in Maine that way
 
00:16:19.730 --> 00:16:19.740 align:start position:0%
and many other states which was an RFP
 
00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:22.320 align:start position:0%
process and then we'd have a third party
 
00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:24.060 align:start position:0%
testing facility
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
Growers and manufacturers would be
 
00:16:28.490 --> 00:16:28.500 align:start position:0%
licensed by the state of New Hampshire
 
00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:31.380 align:start position:0%
and inspected by the division of
 
00:16:33.410 --> 00:16:33.420 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Licensing
 
00:16:36.889 --> 00:16:36.899 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis pricing oversight would
 
00:16:38.629 --> 00:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
occur at the wholesale level in
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
consultation with the New Hampshire
 
00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission we're not setting the
 
00:16:47.389 --> 00:16:47.399 align:start position:0%
price we're Consulting on the price
 
00:16:49.970 --> 00:16:49.980 align:start position:0%
Growers manufacturers and retailers
 
00:16:52.009 --> 00:16:52.019 align:start position:0%
would be responsible for the
 
00:16:53.749 --> 00:16:53.759 align:start position:0%
distribution of cannabis and
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
transportation much like New Hampshire
 
00:16:58.610 --> 00:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
Wineries and New Hampshire distilleries
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
which are allowed to self-distribute
 
00:17:03.889 --> 00:17:03.899 align:start position:0%
The Growers and the manufacturers would
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
be allowed to self-distribute to the
 
00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:08.459 align:start position:0%
retailers it would be no different than
 
00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
what we had the way we have it set up
 
00:17:13.309 --> 00:17:13.319 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire wineries or New
 
00:17:16.069 --> 00:17:16.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire distilleries
 
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
so there'd be a sure uh just help me
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
understand because I I've talked a lot
 
00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:23.520 align:start position:0%
with growers in past years
 
00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
what if there's a bad crop we get a
 
00:17:27.049 --> 00:17:27.059 align:start position:0%
rainy year or for some reason they don't
 
00:17:29.150 --> 00:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
Harvest can we buy out of state to fill
 
00:17:31.250 --> 00:17:31.260 align:start position:0%
our needs so that we we couldn't sell
 
00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:34.380 align:start position:0%
that year a lot of the the growing is
 
00:17:36.890 --> 00:17:36.900 align:start position:0%
done indoor Greenhouse okay the majority
 
00:17:38.930 --> 00:17:38.940 align:start position:0%
of the growing is done indoor Greenhouse
 
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
in controlled settings the product
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
Stacks as a seed it's given a SKU number
 
00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:46.260 align:start position:0%
it works through the whole plate so the
 
00:17:49.130 --> 00:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
whole process from being abud to being a
 
00:17:51.409 --> 00:17:51.419 align:start position:0%
full plant from the trim from that plant
 
00:17:53.810 --> 00:17:53.820 align:start position:0%
to the manufacturing and that
 
00:17:55.549 --> 00:17:55.559 align:start position:0%
manufacturing piece goes into the
 
00:17:57.890 --> 00:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
Edibles there there's certainly an
 
00:18:00.830 --> 00:18:00.840 align:start position:0%
opportunity for outside Growers to grow
 
00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
on small plots of land and harvest their
 
00:18:06.169 --> 00:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
their products but the majority of what
 
00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:09.000 align:start position:0%
you see when you get to a level that we
 
00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
intend to be at without the seats that
 
00:18:15.169 --> 00:18:15.179 align:start position:0%
surround us is indoor grow facilities
 
00:18:18.169 --> 00:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
if I could ask a question in respect to
 
00:18:20.450 --> 00:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
the requirement that it be grown and
 
00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:21.720 align:start position:0%
manufactured in New Hampshire I
 
00:18:23.870 --> 00:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the reason for that obviously
 
00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:25.860 align:start position:0%
when you start crossing over state
 
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:27.480 align:start position:0%
borders you put me around to some other
 
00:18:29.450 --> 00:18:29.460 align:start position:0%
Federal issues
 
00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
again I would be surprised with their
 
00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement but who knows right but my
 
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:35.460 align:start position:0%
my thought was
 
00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:37.380 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have that restriction you
 
00:18:38.990 --> 00:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
couldn't buy it out of state anyway or
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
sell it because you'll be filing that
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
State's law so perhaps if there's a
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
reason we kind of being neutral on that
 
00:18:46.850 --> 00:18:46.860 align:start position:0%
because if one day that were to change
 
00:18:48.529 --> 00:18:48.539 align:start position:0%
we kind of would be able to hit the
 
00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:49.799 align:start position:0%
floor running rather than have to
 
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
legislate a change which I think we can
 
00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
agree the
 
00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020 align:start position:0%
with all the respect to my colleagues
 
00:18:57.289 --> 00:18:57.299 align:start position:0%
the legislator tends to work slow yeah
 
00:18:58.610 --> 00:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
there's nothing in the bill that
 
00:19:00.890 --> 00:19:00.900 align:start position:0%
actually bars it okay it's always been
 
00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
treated this is an FTC you know Federal
 
00:19:05.450 --> 00:19:05.460 align:start position:0%
Trade Commission regulation it was a
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
shock to me when I first got involved
 
00:19:09.110 --> 00:19:09.120 align:start position:0%
was to find out that every state is
 
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:11.160 align:start position:0%
really lit everybody's within their live
 
00:19:12.650 --> 00:19:12.660 align:start position:0%
within their own state but you're
 
00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:14.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely right the the issue would be
 
00:19:16.789 --> 00:19:16.799 align:start position:0%
is that you're buying across the state
 
00:19:19.430 --> 00:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
line and uh but but at this point in
 
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
time we we would not want to borrow
 
00:19:24.049 --> 00:19:24.059 align:start position:0%
ourselves from if that Federal rule were
 
00:19:26.330 --> 00:19:26.340 align:start position:0%
to change if at some point in time we
 
00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:27.720 align:start position:0%
would absolutely would want to be able
 
00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000 align:start position:0%
to import it and keeping in mind if a
 
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
retail would purchase from Maine or
 
00:19:33.950 --> 00:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they're going to have a
 
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:36.419 align:start position:0%
they're filing that State's law and so
 
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:38.400 align:start position:0%
with the distributor so they I mean they
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
would they would have their own problems
 
00:19:41.810 --> 00:19:41.820 align:start position:0%
that they have to deal with it's not in
 
00:19:42.590 --> 00:19:42.600 align:start position:0%
this state I don't know if there's any
 
00:19:44.690 --> 00:19:44.700 align:start position:0%
comment on that policy or anyone have
 
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:45.950 align:start position:0%
comment on that policy or anyone have
any

00:19:45.950 --> 00:19:45.960 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
I always like to say that what makes our
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
liquor stores very unique
 
00:19:53.990 --> 00:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
is that we um actually do very well with
 
00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:55.500 align:start position:0%
out-of-state product
 
00:19:57.289 --> 00:19:57.299 align:start position:0%
and that New Hampshire we like to try
 
00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
our best we've promoted we've actually
 
00:20:00.950 --> 00:20:00.960 align:start position:0%
passed legislation to force them to put
 
00:20:03.289 --> 00:20:03.299 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire products on the front of
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
the store but let's face it we do not
 
00:20:08.810 --> 00:20:08.820 align:start position:0%
have name brand right we go to Total the
 
00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
competitor we do not have our own name
 
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:13.620 align:start position:0%
brand vodkas or anything like that we
 
00:20:18.289 --> 00:20:18.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.710 --> 00:20:20.720 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:25.070 --> 00:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
a few questions about
 
00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
HIV model with respect season licensing
 
00:20:32.810 --> 00:20:32.820 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and growing so
 
00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:33.890 align:start position:0%
manufacturing and growing so
um

00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:33.900 --> 00:20:39.610 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

00:20:39.610 --> 00:20:39.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
okay I hit it twice okay thank you
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not a franchisee so I'm going
 
00:20:48.230 --> 00:20:48.240 align:start position:0%
to need a little help here so it's my
 
00:20:50.350 --> 00:20:50.360 align:start position:0%
impression that
 
00:20:53.870 --> 00:20:53.880 align:start position:0%
franchisees as you propose in this model
 
00:20:57.830 --> 00:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
are required to buy product from a
 
00:21:00.070 --> 00:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
licensed um
 
00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:02.580 align:start position:0%
producer of let's say hamburgers or
 
00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:05.160 align:start position:0%
french fries that are acceptable to the
 
00:21:07.070 --> 00:21:07.080 align:start position:0%
corporation would that be would that be
 
00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
correct in this model that's correct
 
00:21:11.450 --> 00:21:11.460 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:12.110 align:start position:0%
okay so
um

00:21:12.110 --> 00:21:12.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:16.010 --> 00:21:16.020 align:start position:0%
who in this model would be responsible
 
00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.100 align:start position:0%
for testing to determine whether or not
 
00:21:23.990 --> 00:21:24.000 align:start position:0%
um the licensed manufacturer products
 
00:21:26.810 --> 00:21:26.820 align:start position:0%
that would be sold to franchisees would
 
00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
be harmful or not harmful to the public
 
00:21:31.909 --> 00:21:31.919 align:start position:0%
third-party testing would be done on
 
00:21:34.810 --> 00:21:34.820 align:start position:0%
every product that leaves any
 
00:21:39.470 --> 00:21:39.480 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or grower okay so then the
 
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:40.990 align:start position:0%
manufacturer or grower okay so then the
licensee

00:21:40.990 --> 00:21:41.000 align:start position:0%
licensee
 
00:21:43.909 --> 00:21:43.919 align:start position:0%
that would be allowed to grow would be a
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
license under the regulation and the
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
authority of the Liquor Commission
 
00:21:51.110 --> 00:21:51.120 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct okay has the
 
00:21:55.330 --> 00:21:55.340 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission developed a plan
 
00:21:59.529 --> 00:21:59.539 align:start position:0%
and regulations or looked at
 
00:22:03.169 --> 00:22:03.179 align:start position:0%
allowable chemicals and pesticides and
 
00:22:05.350 --> 00:22:05.360 align:start position:0%
there are allowable amounts
 
00:22:08.450 --> 00:22:08.460 align:start position:0%
that could be found and should be tested
 
00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:09.250 align:start position:0%
that could be found and should be tested
for

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:09.260 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
in any franchisee product no we have not
 
00:22:15.049 --> 00:22:15.059 align:start position:0%
and the reason that we have not is
 
00:22:17.270 --> 00:22:17.280 align:start position:0%
because the legislation calls for a
 
00:22:19.789 --> 00:22:19.799 align:start position:0%
consultant that would help to guide The
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission on those parameters
 
00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
have you looked at the current status of
 
00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:28.400 align:start position:0%
what health Canada
 
00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:31.860 align:start position:0%
has produced with respect to the
 
00:22:34.570 --> 00:22:34.580 align:start position:0%
identification of more than 100
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
allowable and unallowable chemicals and
 
00:22:41.090 --> 00:22:41.100 align:start position:0%
pesticides I've looked at many different
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
States including Canada as to what they
 
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
allow and that would be the job of the
 
00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
consultant that we would hire to guide
 
00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission as to what we
 
00:22:54.529 --> 00:22:54.539 align:start position:0%
would allow and not allow
 
00:22:59.510 --> 00:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
do you have any idea what the cost would
 
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:01.940 align:start position:0%
be for
 
00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:07.320 align:start position:0%
inspecting on and testing for franchisee
 
00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:10.559 align:start position:0%
products that are sold through the state
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:18.649 --> 00:23:18.659 align:start position:0%
in other words if you're proposing 65
 
00:23:21.350 --> 00:23:21.360 align:start position:0%
Outlets that is one outlet for
 
00:23:23.890 --> 00:23:23.900 align:start position:0%
approximately every 18
 
00:23:26.990 --> 00:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
646 residents of the State of New
 
00:23:30.409 --> 00:23:30.419 align:start position:0%
Hampshire what uh is the projected cost
 
00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:34.280 align:start position:0%
both in terms of personnel that would be
 
00:23:37.970 --> 00:23:37.980 align:start position:0%
required to obtain the samples set up a
 
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
sampling testing scheme the number of
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
Representative samples per site or per
 
00:23:47.110 --> 00:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
grow or per acre and then submit those
 
00:23:50.570 --> 00:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
to a testing laboratory license or
 
00:23:52.789 --> 00:23:52.799 align:start position:0%
approved by the state that would be a
 
00:23:55.610 --> 00:23:55.620 align:start position:0%
cost correct correct and do you have any
 
00:23:57.710 --> 00:23:57.720 align:start position:0%
idea what that cost would be no because
 
00:23:59.210 --> 00:23:59.220 align:start position:0%
we don't have any idea what the
 
00:24:01.130 --> 00:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
legislation looks like yet when the
 
00:24:03.409 --> 00:24:03.419 align:start position:0%
legislation comes into play then we can
 
00:24:06.289 --> 00:24:06.299 align:start position:0%
put the costs into play our our purpose
 
00:24:09.529 --> 00:24:09.539 align:start position:0%
is to be here today to explain a model
 
00:24:12.049 --> 00:24:12.059 align:start position:0%
that's very unique and would be unique
 
00:24:13.909 --> 00:24:13.919 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire and that
 
00:24:16.130 --> 00:24:16.140 align:start position:0%
as business people we feel would be
 
00:24:19.490 --> 00:24:19.500 align:start position:0%
profitable and safe for the state
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
would it be fair to say then though that
 
00:24:23.990 --> 00:24:24.000 align:start position:0%
to determine profitability it would be
 
00:24:25.789 --> 00:24:25.799 align:start position:0%
necessary to determine or at least
 
00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
ballpark the cost of let's say an
 
00:24:31.190 --> 00:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
aggregate amount of product that would
 
00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
be anticipated that would be sold based
 
00:24:36.289 --> 00:24:36.299 align:start position:0%
on some experiential models of other
 
00:24:36.299 --> 00:24:37.610 align:start position:0%
on some experiential models of other
states

00:24:37.610 --> 00:24:37.620 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
I would say that's fair but that model
 
00:24:43.430 --> 00:24:43.440 align:start position:0%
in terms of cost per testing and
 
00:24:45.169 --> 00:24:45.179 align:start position:0%
Regulatory Authority has not been
 
00:24:47.630 --> 00:24:47.640 align:start position:0%
conducted correct that's correct thank
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:59.810 --> 00:24:59.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:01.370 --> 00:25:01.380 align:start position:0%
under your model
 
00:25:03.049 --> 00:25:03.059 align:start position:0%
everything would be grown and
 
00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:05.460 align:start position:0%
manufactured in New Hampshire it has to
 
00:25:08.690 --> 00:25:08.700 align:start position:0%
be it has to be that's a federal yeah
 
00:25:11.149 --> 00:25:11.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I I understand the tax history and
 
00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:14.280 align:start position:0%
the original tax stamp one yeah yeah I
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
understand that the testing would then
 
00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:20.340 align:start position:0%
be determined by it would be to be
 
00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:22.500 align:start position:0%
determined by the consultant that we
 
00:25:24.649 --> 00:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
would hire us or what those were based
 
00:25:27.169 --> 00:25:27.179 align:start position:0%
upon available evidence at the time all
 
00:25:28.850 --> 00:25:28.860 align:start position:0%
right and depending on what the final
 
00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:32.760 align:start position:0%
legislation comes up with correct
 
00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:36.360 align:start position:0%
the manufacturing facility for the uh
 
00:25:38.510 --> 00:25:38.520 align:start position:0%
uh non-raw product
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
for the Edibles for lack of a better
 
00:25:40.799 --> 00:25:41.630 align:start position:0%
for the Edibles for lack of a better
term

00:25:41.630 --> 00:25:41.640 align:start position:0%
term
 
00:25:44.750 --> 00:25:44.760 align:start position:0%
or ingredients for baking or whatever
 
00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:45.830 align:start position:0%
or ingredients for baking or whatever
else

00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:47.640 align:start position:0%
would be
 
00:25:51.950 --> 00:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
who would examine that structure or is
 
00:25:53.630 --> 00:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
that still in the air or that would that
 
00:25:55.549 --> 00:25:55.559 align:start position:0%
be done by the Department of Agriculture
 
00:25:58.549 --> 00:25:58.559 align:start position:0%
or or one of one of the agencies within
 
00:25:58.559 --> 00:25:59.510 align:start position:0%
or or one of one of the agencies within
here

00:25:59.510 --> 00:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:26:01.610 --> 00:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
that would be done by the consultant as
 
00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:04.980 align:start position:0%
well the consultant would we would get
 
00:26:07.669 --> 00:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
the parameters for the consultant
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
as as what they feel is safe and what we
 
00:26:15.830 --> 00:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
see that other states are doing and then
 
00:26:18.950 --> 00:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
the parameters anything that leaves a
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturing or growing facility would
 
00:26:23.870 --> 00:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
have to meet those parameters and would
 
00:26:26.269 --> 00:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
be governed by The Liquor Commission
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement division to make sure that
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
those products meet those parameters
 
00:26:36.289 --> 00:26:36.299 align:start position:0%
right and follow thank you Mr chair and
 
00:26:36.299 --> 00:26:37.250 align:start position:0%
right and follow thank you Mr chair and
um

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:38.940 align:start position:0%
how do I put this without getting in
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
trouble I understand
 
00:26:41.159 --> 00:26:43.190 align:start position:0%
trouble I understand
that

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:26:46.330 --> 00:26:46.340 align:start position:0%
different products have different uh
 
00:26:48.649 --> 00:26:48.659 align:start position:0%
composite structures
 
00:26:50.870 --> 00:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
who would be responsible for
 
00:26:54.049 --> 00:26:54.059 align:start position:0%
establishing the labeling which would
 
00:26:57.590 --> 00:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
specify THC CBD participation whether
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
it's indica or sativa or nocturna or
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
erotica or whatever blend they make the
 
00:27:08.210 --> 00:27:08.220 align:start position:0%
in consultation with the consultant The
 
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission would be responsible
 
00:27:12.529 --> 00:27:12.539 align:start position:0%
for that for the design and then the the
 
00:27:14.210 --> 00:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
retailer would have to have that
 
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:16.200 align:start position:0%
labeling on which your Enforcement
 
00:27:18.049 --> 00:27:18.059 align:start position:0%
Officers would check on is that correct
 
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
that's correct and that's further into
 
00:27:21.950 --> 00:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
the the deck
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
yes just one one thought one it was some
 
00:27:30.649 --> 00:27:30.659 align:start position:0%
issue brought up on the fiscal side or
 
00:27:32.690 --> 00:27:32.700 align:start position:0%
on a profitability perspective
 
00:27:36.169 --> 00:27:36.179 align:start position:0%
I know prior bills the fiscal note I'm
 
00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:38.100 align:start position:0%
going to involved retail candidates they
 
00:27:39.529 --> 00:27:39.539 align:start position:0%
had a fiscal note with an anticipated
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
amount of sales I'm not sure how those
 
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
numbers were configured and if the
 
00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:45.360 align:start position:0%
purposes of 1598
 
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
I mean some of the testimony I provided
 
00:27:49.250 --> 00:27:49.260 align:start position:0%
was based on taking looking at prior
 
00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
fiscal notes so if you look at last term
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
HB 237
 
00:27:55.549 --> 00:27:55.559 align:start position:0%
uh that would have had a fiscal law on
 
00:27:57.610 --> 00:27:57.620 align:start position:0%
the retail side without it being
 
00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:00.360 align:start position:0%
operated by state employees but I I
 
00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
don't know how that number actually
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
first came about I don't know if anyone
 
00:28:07.669 --> 00:28:07.679 align:start position:0%
can dig that up but representative way
 
00:28:10.850 --> 00:28:10.860 align:start position:0%
so that bill was in ways and means and I
 
00:28:13.250 --> 00:28:13.260 align:start position:0%
think if we remember right Chief Mr
 
00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
commissioner was what we um
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
looked at the other states and what they
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
were doing including the fact that we
 
00:28:20.870 --> 00:28:20.880 align:start position:0%
understand that some of the sales are
 
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:22.860 align:start position:0%
out of state employees out of state
 
00:28:24.769 --> 00:28:24.779 align:start position:0%
visitors but they looked at what the
 
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
gross sales was divided by the number of
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
citizens they had to come out with with
 
00:28:30.529 --> 00:28:30.539 align:start position:0%
the average cost per citizen is of
 
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:32.460 align:start position:0%
Revenue and then they extrapolated that
 
00:28:33.769 --> 00:28:33.779 align:start position:0%
based on New Hampshire's Revenue that's
 
00:28:35.690 --> 00:28:35.700 align:start position:0%
how we came up with our I think it was
 
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
250 million dollars last year in gross
 
00:28:40.190 --> 00:28:40.200 align:start position:0%
sales that we thought based on
 
00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:43.440 align:start position:0%
what we saw in other states and what um
 
00:28:46.430 --> 00:28:46.440 align:start position:0%
and based it on the Hampshire's uh per
 
00:28:50.630 --> 00:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
capita thank you Chief yes thank you Mr
 
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
chair one follow-up question uh who
 
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:55.500 align:start position:0%
would uh make the determination to
 
00:28:59.149 --> 00:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
identify and hire the consultant
 
00:29:02.210 --> 00:29:02.220 align:start position:0%
I it would be an RFP and the Liquor
 
00:29:06.049 --> 00:29:06.059 align:start position:0%
Commission would make that determination
 
00:29:09.610 --> 00:29:09.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure we're kind
 
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
of wrap it wrap up all of that
 
00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
conversation so in short The Liquor
 
00:29:16.850 --> 00:29:16.860 align:start position:0%
Commission and consultant in
 
00:29:18.710 --> 00:29:18.720 align:start position:0%
consultation with with an industry
 
00:29:21.169 --> 00:29:21.179 align:start position:0%
expert would establish what the testing
 
00:29:23.330 --> 00:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
standards would look like than those
 
00:29:25.190 --> 00:29:25.200 align:start position:0%
testing standards would be applied to
 
00:29:26.930 --> 00:29:26.940 align:start position:0%
the product whatever it was whatever its
 
00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.120 align:start position:0%
source was to all the product and they
 
00:29:31.190 --> 00:29:31.200 align:start position:0%
would make sure it would meet that
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
criteria and then it would finally make
 
00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:34.740 align:start position:0%
its way into the retail Market that's
 
00:29:38.570 --> 00:29:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:42.600 align:start position:0%
okay and and Senator that would be after
 
00:29:44.330 --> 00:29:44.340 align:start position:0%
the product was tested by the third
 
00:29:47.750 --> 00:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
party lab so okay thank you
 
00:29:50.750 --> 00:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:55.549 --> 00:29:55.559 align:start position:0%
so we'll move on to page 12.
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
and there would be a franchise agreement
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
between the retailer and the New
 
00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:01.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Liquor Commission
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
as part of the franchise agreement the
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
retailer shall provide the nhlc with 15
 
00:30:09.409 --> 00:30:09.419 align:start position:0%
percent of the gross monthly sales of
 
00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
their individual establishment to be
 
00:30:15.169 --> 00:30:15.179 align:start position:0%
paid on a quarterly basis so that's
 
00:30:16.610 --> 00:30:16.620 align:start position:0%
where the state
 
00:30:20.570 --> 00:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
would profit from the sales of cannabis
 
00:30:23.330 --> 00:30:23.340 align:start position:0%
in the state the stored design and setup
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
would be through the New Hampshire
 
00:30:26.570 --> 00:30:26.580 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and their vendors to
 
00:30:29.029 --> 00:30:29.039 align:start position:0%
ensure a consistent branding and
 
00:30:31.909 --> 00:30:31.919 align:start position:0%
reputation so we would go out for an RFP
 
00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059 align:start position:0%
for someone to provide the cases the
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
signage the look the feel of the store
 
00:30:41.690 --> 00:30:41.700 align:start position:0%
there'd be no more retail locations than
 
00:30:43.490 --> 00:30:43.500 align:start position:0%
the number of New Hampshire liquor and
 
00:30:45.409 --> 00:30:45.419 align:start position:0%
wine outlets in the state
 
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
and we've there has been a map that
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
showed you where they were and there can
 
00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:54.299 align:start position:0%
be no more retail locations uh I'm sorry
 
00:30:56.330 --> 00:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
than the 65.
 
00:30:58.549 --> 00:30:58.559 align:start position:0%
and the retailers and vendors for design
 
00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:01.140 align:start position:0%
would be selected through an RFP process
 
00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.990 align:start position:0%
would be selected through an RFP process
so

00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:08.090 --> 00:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
as we go out and look for people to run
 
00:31:12.230 --> 00:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
these locations we'd send out an RFP and
 
00:31:15.169 --> 00:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
obviously there'd be some stands that
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
have more than one Outlet Nashua for
 
00:31:20.990 --> 00:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
example as for liquor and wine outlets
 
00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:23.120 align:start position:0%
they would have four Cannabis stores
 
00:31:25.730 --> 00:31:25.740 align:start position:0%
Concord has two liquor and wine outlets
 
00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
they'd have two Cannabis stores and if
 
00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
we came if we had a jurisdiction that
 
00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:36.120 align:start position:0%
did not want a cannabis store in their
 
00:31:38.690 --> 00:31:38.700 align:start position:0%
town then we would go to the surrounding
 
00:31:42.529 --> 00:31:42.539 align:start position:0%
towns first and search those towns for a
 
00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
town that wanted to have a cannabis
 
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:46.750 align:start position:0%
town that wanted to have a cannabis
store

00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:51.110 --> 00:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
on page 13 the retailers will not be in
 
00:31:53.630 --> 00:31:53.640 align:start position:0%
the same liquor locations as a liquor
 
00:31:56.450 --> 00:31:56.460 align:start position:0%
and wine outlet and we would absolutely
 
00:31:59.570 --> 00:31:59.580 align:start position:0%
prefer that they weren't in the same
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
um the same malls the same locations in
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
order to
 
00:32:07.490 --> 00:32:07.500 align:start position:0%
not coincide with any cross-pollination
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
between the liquor stores and the
 
00:32:13.669 --> 00:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
Cannabis stores the retailers shall not
 
00:32:16.850 --> 00:32:16.860 align:start position:0%
be located in residential districts or
 
00:32:19.310 --> 00:32:19.320 align:start position:0%
within pre-existing design drug-free
 
00:32:22.130 --> 00:32:22.140 align:start position:0%
school zones the Cannabis and marketing
 
00:32:25.370 --> 00:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
shall be done by The Liquor Commission
 
00:32:28.190 --> 00:32:28.200 align:start position:0%
and the municipalities can determine an
 
00:32:31.490 --> 00:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
opt-in to have a cannabis retailer and
 
00:32:34.130 --> 00:32:34.140 align:start position:0%
the municipalities shall receive one
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
percent of the 15 percent growth uh
 
00:32:40.850 --> 00:32:40.860 align:start position:0%
monthly sales provided to The Liquor
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
Commission so before we go on I do have
 
00:32:46.190 --> 00:32:46.200 align:start position:0%
a question sure I'm sorry so
 
00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.230 align:start position:0%
a question sure I'm sorry so
um

00:32:47.230 --> 00:32:47.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:49.860 align:start position:0%
it just dawn on me we're we're creating
 
00:32:51.950 --> 00:32:51.960 align:start position:0%
these franchisees
 
00:32:55.789 --> 00:32:55.799 align:start position:0%
and we're doing all the marketing
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
but part of marketing is actually
 
00:32:57.720 --> 00:32:58.909 align:start position:0%
but part of marketing is actually
pricing

00:32:58.909 --> 00:32:58.919 align:start position:0%
pricing
 
00:33:02.149 --> 00:33:02.159 align:start position:0%
correct so I'm not asking you to have
 
00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:04.260 align:start position:0%
tell us what we do today but I would say
 
00:33:06.889 --> 00:33:06.899 align:start position:0%
as as someone who sits on the the
 
00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
committee that's dealt with these issues
 
00:33:11.090 --> 00:33:11.100 align:start position:0%
over the years uh we would be uh
 
00:33:12.730 --> 00:33:12.740 align:start position:0%
interested in how you're going to handle
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
in-store marketing
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
in terms of whether someone wants to
 
00:33:18.830 --> 00:33:18.840 align:start position:0%
give a price discount you know whether
 
00:33:21.049 --> 00:33:21.059 align:start position:0%
they want to have a special price uh the
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
one I heard today when I was in
 
00:33:25.130 --> 00:33:25.140 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts was this weekend was at a
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
store uh Wednesday Wednesday is Veterans
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
Day and they give a five percent
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
discount to veterans
 
00:33:35.149 --> 00:33:35.159 align:start position:0%
so in terms of how at some point I'm
 
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:37.440 align:start position:0%
thinking about all these little integral
 
00:33:40.610 --> 00:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
elements of these franchisees
 
00:33:42.169 --> 00:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
um because I assume we don't want to see
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
a franchisee trying to out franchise
 
00:33:46.549 --> 00:33:46.559 align:start position:0%
outsell another franchisee because
 
00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:48.720 align:start position:0%
you're doing all the marketing in terms
 
00:33:50.529 --> 00:33:50.539 align:start position:0%
of they can't advertise
 
00:33:53.690 --> 00:33:53.700 align:start position:0%
outside other than what they do inside
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
the store so that we'll need some
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
guidelines on what they can and can't do
 
00:33:59.570 --> 00:33:59.580 align:start position:0%
inside that store well we would create
 
00:34:01.730 --> 00:34:01.740 align:start position:0%
much like we do with alcohol we would
 
00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:05.760 align:start position:0%
create a marketing design in a marketing
 
00:34:08.690 --> 00:34:08.700 align:start position:0%
scheme and we would do either a monthly
 
00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:09.770 align:start position:0%
scheme and we would do either a monthly
marketing

00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
marketing
 
00:34:13.550 --> 00:34:13.560 align:start position:0%
or a a weekly marketing we certainly
 
00:34:16.430 --> 00:34:16.440 align:start position:0%
allow them to to put something special
 
00:34:20.089 --> 00:34:20.099 align:start position:0%
on on special and discount it one of the
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
unique things here is we're dealing with
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
a product that is is moisture intense so
 
00:34:27.649 --> 00:34:27.659 align:start position:0%
what it what it's what it's worth today
 
00:34:30.109 --> 00:34:30.119 align:start position:0%
and the value and weight today is
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
different than it is two weeks later so
 
00:34:34.070 --> 00:34:34.080 align:start position:0%
we have to make sure that those
 
00:34:37.310 --> 00:34:37.320 align:start position:0%
franchisees have the availability
 
00:34:40.190 --> 00:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
to Discount the product so they remain
 
00:34:42.050 --> 00:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
profitable move stuff that needs to be
 
00:34:44.750 --> 00:34:44.760 align:start position:0%
moved because of its age cool that
 
00:34:47.349 --> 00:34:47.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't necessarily uh take into account
 
00:34:49.790 --> 00:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
uh the Edibles because we don't
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
necessarily see that problem with the
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
edibles but with the flour and the shape
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
or the bud any of that would they we'd
 
00:34:59.349 --> 00:34:59.359 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that the franchisees
 
00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:02.099 align:start position:0%
uh have the ability to Discount the
 
00:35:03.890 --> 00:35:03.900 align:start position:0%
product in order to remain profitable
 
00:35:06.410 --> 00:35:06.420 align:start position:0%
right but again it's going to be across
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
the board by all franchisees or well
 
00:35:10.730 --> 00:35:10.740 align:start position:0%
individual franchisees be able to do
 
00:35:13.550 --> 00:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
something special in their location they
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
would be able to do something special in
 
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
their location provided that the Liquor
 
00:35:19.790 --> 00:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
Commission agreed to it because you're
 
00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
not going to have every franchisee carry
 
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
every every one of the same products
 
00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
right and the cost of doing business in
 
00:35:29.870 --> 00:35:29.880 align:start position:0%
Colebrook is much different than the
 
00:35:32.329 --> 00:35:32.339 align:start position:0%
cost of doing business in Bedford so
 
00:35:33.770 --> 00:35:33.780 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to allow those
 
00:35:37.250 --> 00:35:37.260 align:start position:0%
franchisees to to represent their
 
00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980 align:start position:0%
brought their markup scheme a little bit
 
00:35:42.890 --> 00:35:42.900 align:start position:0%
differently depending on what area they
 
00:35:44.810 --> 00:35:44.820 align:start position:0%
can good and because I realize there's a
 
00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:46.440 align:start position:0%
little down in the weeds here but it's
 
00:35:48.050 --> 00:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
just something that I know acutely aware
 
00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
of it it's a it's a legitimate question
 
00:35:52.550 --> 00:35:52.560 align:start position:0%
because in any franchise model you know
 
00:35:56.270 --> 00:35:56.280 align:start position:0%
a Big Mac is a Big Mac it's 529 in
 
00:35:58.790 --> 00:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
Pittsburgh uh well I was very happy that
 
00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:00.540 align:start position:0%
they brought back the two burritos for
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
breakfast that I have knowledge at three
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
dollars at 5 29 in Tampa so but with
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
this particular product you can't do it
 
00:36:11.810 --> 00:36:11.820 align:start position:0%
the franchisee model of what we're
 
00:36:15.589 --> 00:36:15.599 align:start position:0%
looking at has to do more with the
 
00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
advertising and the uh enforcement look
 
00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:24.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:26.630 --> 00:36:26.640 align:start position:0%
the discussion that uh representative
 
00:36:28.130 --> 00:36:28.140 align:start position:0%
Pond brought up
 
00:36:28.140 --> 00:36:28.790 align:start position:0%
Pond brought up
um

00:36:28.790 --> 00:36:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:30.290 --> 00:36:30.300 align:start position:0%
brought to mind
 
00:36:32.810 --> 00:36:32.820 align:start position:0%
we already have an existing and uh
 
00:36:34.790 --> 00:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
modestly growing
 
00:36:38.569 --> 00:36:38.579 align:start position:0%
um medical marijuana
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
group of facilities how are these going
 
00:36:43.190 --> 00:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
to be integrated into that will they be
 
00:36:45.470 --> 00:36:45.480 align:start position:0%
a lot will they be separated within the
 
00:36:49.250 --> 00:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
store or separated by sale or or does
 
00:36:52.010 --> 00:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
that just go by the buy because you're
 
00:36:56.030 --> 00:36:56.040 align:start position:0%
no longer needing the medical card no I
 
00:36:57.710 --> 00:36:57.720 align:start position:0%
think what would be taken into
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
consideration would be somebody's
 
00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
experience in business and the location
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
of the business we're certainly not in a
 
00:37:08.810 --> 00:37:08.820 align:start position:0%
in a position or do we want to pick
 
00:37:11.810 --> 00:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
winners and losers but those facilities
 
00:37:15.250 --> 00:37:15.260 align:start position:0%
would be allowed to uh
 
00:37:19.130 --> 00:37:19.140 align:start position:0%
apply for a retail license as well and
 
00:37:21.890 --> 00:37:21.900 align:start position:0%
obviously being that they've been in
 
00:37:23.630 --> 00:37:23.640 align:start position:0%
business and they have experience in
 
00:37:27.530 --> 00:37:27.540 align:start position:0%
business would be favorable for their uh
 
00:37:27.540 --> 00:37:29.030 align:start position:0%
business would be favorable for their uh
application

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:29.040 align:start position:0%
application
 
00:37:31.970 --> 00:37:31.980 align:start position:0%
and nothing would debar the continuation
 
00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:34.380 align:start position:0%
of their operation I'm sorry nothing
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
would prevent them from continuing in
 
00:37:39.829 --> 00:37:39.839 align:start position:0%
operation with this even if they decided
 
00:37:42.829 --> 00:37:42.839 align:start position:0%
not to go Whole Hog not as far as we're
 
00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:49.130 --> 00:37:49.140 align:start position:0%
if I can inquire the question and I
 
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
certainly appreciate trying to keep the
 
00:37:53.270 --> 00:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
brand of the liquor stores the New
 
00:37:56.089 --> 00:37:56.099 align:start position:0%
Hampshire runs keep that apart from any
 
00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
cannabis store that's franchised
 
00:38:01.130 --> 00:38:01.140 align:start position:0%
I I didn't hear you say that perhaps you
 
00:38:02.510 --> 00:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even want them to be in the
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
same strip mall the same facility like
 
00:38:07.490 --> 00:38:07.500 align:start position:0%
that I guess my my concern is
 
00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh I was thinking I was just thinking 93
 
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
and 95 when you said that well first and
 
00:38:16.250 --> 00:38:16.260 align:start position:0%
foremost we we we're putting that caveat
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
in there because we're not sure how our
 
00:38:21.410 --> 00:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
landlords feel the landlords in those
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
particular locations feel like we have
 
00:38:26.450 --> 00:38:26.460 align:start position:0%
one particular landlord who doesn't want
 
00:38:28.849 --> 00:38:28.859 align:start position:0%
to have gambling in their in their strip
 
00:38:31.490 --> 00:38:31.500 align:start position:0%
malls so we we certainly don't want to
 
00:38:34.609 --> 00:38:34.619 align:start position:0%
you know make uh you know put our
 
00:38:36.770 --> 00:38:36.780 align:start position:0%
landlords in a difficult position where
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
we have long-term leases with a liquor
 
00:38:40.970 --> 00:38:40.980 align:start position:0%
store if they choose not to have
 
00:38:44.089 --> 00:38:44.099 align:start position:0%
cannabis in their facility then we look
 
00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:46.800 align:start position:0%
for another facility so I think the
 
00:38:49.430 --> 00:38:49.440 align:start position:0%
easiest way to do that is to separate it
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
and then to find out later if somebody
 
00:38:54.410 --> 00:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
wants or something's available and
 
00:38:56.329 --> 00:38:56.339 align:start position:0%
they're willing then we can look at it
 
00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:58.140 align:start position:0%
but we certainly don't want to say we
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
want them right next to every liquor
 
00:39:02.390 --> 00:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
store that we have because you know 58
 
00:39:04.730 --> 00:39:04.740 align:start position:0%
of our liquor stores are leased so I
 
00:39:06.170 --> 00:39:06.180 align:start position:0%
just follow up because I think the
 
00:39:08.089 --> 00:39:08.099 align:start position:0%
problem is the word location yeah
 
00:39:12.710 --> 00:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
okay okay so as we know the uh 93-95 the
 
00:39:15.349 --> 00:39:15.359 align:start position:0%
highways correct are actually not run by
 
00:39:18.170 --> 00:39:18.180 align:start position:0%
the commission you are a tenant in those
 
00:39:20.329 --> 00:39:20.339 align:start position:0%
locations and that they're actually
 
00:39:23.510 --> 00:39:23.520 align:start position:0%
their state state uh real estate so the
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
question would be is could we open up on
 
00:39:29.470 --> 00:39:29.480 align:start position:0%
those roadsides not in the same building
 
00:39:33.109 --> 00:39:33.119 align:start position:0%
but another stand-alone building I think
 
00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
it could be a marijuana and that's where
 
00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
I think the word location and assuming
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
the landlord or the was was just the
 
00:39:41.690 --> 00:39:41.700 align:start position:0%
state the transportation yes and just to
 
00:39:43.490 --> 00:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
back up just a little bit representative
 
00:39:46.790 --> 00:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
uh we own our facilities North the
 
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
building itself yeah but aren't you
 
00:39:51.349 --> 00:39:51.359 align:start position:0%
isn't the building at least the to the
 
00:39:54.170 --> 00:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
uh we we own the 20 000 square feet that
 
00:39:57.410 --> 00:39:57.420 align:start position:0%
the liquor store sits on We Own the
 
00:39:59.450 --> 00:39:59.460 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission owners Irving owned
 
00:40:02.030 --> 00:40:02.040 align:start position:0%
their lot no they do not they're 10
 
00:40:04.970 --> 00:40:04.980 align:start position:0%
they're a tenant everyone else there is
 
00:40:10.450 --> 00:40:10.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:13.550 --> 00:40:13.560 align:start position:0%
can we put one of these that word
 
00:40:16.550 --> 00:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
location implies it can't be there at
 
00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:18.780 align:start position:0%
all and I don't I'm not sure that's what
 
00:40:20.990 --> 00:40:21.000 align:start position:0%
you meant well I think what we're as I
 
00:40:22.790 --> 00:40:22.800 align:start position:0%
said what we were trying to do is to
 
00:40:25.130 --> 00:40:25.140 align:start position:0%
make sure that we weren't putting any
 
00:40:28.670 --> 00:40:28.680 align:start position:0%
pressure or any innuendo toward our
 
00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
landlords of our liquor stores now if
 
00:40:34.550 --> 00:40:34.560 align:start position:0%
DLT decides they think it's a great idea
 
00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:37.500 align:start position:0%
to have a cannabis store North and South
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
which I would imagine they would but
 
00:40:41.390 --> 00:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
then they would we would build a
 
00:40:43.310 --> 00:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
facility there The Liquor Commission
 
00:40:45.710 --> 00:40:45.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't own that property anymore we
 
00:40:48.650 --> 00:40:48.660 align:start position:0%
sold it when we did the RFP we own our
 
00:40:51.710 --> 00:40:51.720 align:start position:0%
20 000 square feet and we pay a cam
 
00:40:55.130 --> 00:40:55.140 align:start position:0%
common area maintenance fee on the
 
00:40:57.609 --> 00:40:57.619 align:start position:0%
facility now when we did the Hampton
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
Northbound and southbound that caveat
 
00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:04.020 align:start position:0%
could be put in the RFP that we would
 
00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:07.200 align:start position:0%
allow to a liquor store to be Northbound
 
00:41:10.490 --> 00:41:10.500 align:start position:0%
and Southbound liquor stores as for
 
00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
whoever buys that property again we will
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
fold our 25
 
00:41:19.010 --> 00:41:19.020 align:start position:0%
000 square foot locations when we do
 
00:41:21.170 --> 00:41:21.180 align:start position:0%
those stores that the state will own
 
00:41:24.109 --> 00:41:24.119 align:start position:0%
okay thank you for the clarification
 
00:41:26.870 --> 00:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
so again to summarize some of that
 
00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:27.530 align:start position:0%
so again to summarize some of that
um

00:41:27.530 --> 00:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
is your intent in that first bullet to
 
00:41:31.970 --> 00:41:31.980 align:start position:0%
say that it won't be inside the liquor
 
00:41:34.190 --> 00:41:34.200 align:start position:0%
store or could it be in the same ship
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
mall if the if the property owner allows
 
00:41:40.069 --> 00:41:40.079 align:start position:0%
for marijuana the goal of that was to
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
mainly do just that it can't be inside
 
00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:44.820 align:start position:0%
but it can be within the same facility
 
00:41:46.670 --> 00:41:46.680 align:start position:0%
over our store yeah that's correct your
 
00:41:49.069 --> 00:41:49.079 align:start position:0%
word location means inside the liquor
 
00:41:54.250 --> 00:41:54.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:57.710 --> 00:41:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.890 --> 00:42:00.900 align:start position:0%
so on page 14 we'll uh
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
we can go through some of the uh The
 
00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission division of
 
00:42:08.089 --> 00:42:08.099 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Licensing
 
00:42:08.099 --> 00:42:10.130 align:start position:0%
enforcement and Licensing
um

00:42:10.130 --> 00:42:10.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:12.109 --> 00:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
so a warning label there's some
 
00:42:15.349 --> 00:42:15.359 align:start position:0%
standardized uh all cannabis products
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
sold by retail Cannabis stores shall
 
00:42:21.470 --> 00:42:21.480 align:start position:0%
include warning label caution when eaten
 
00:42:25.010 --> 00:42:25.020 align:start position:0%
or swallowed intoxicating effects a
 
00:42:27.230 --> 00:42:27.240 align:start position:0%
disclosure of ingredients and possible
 
00:42:31.130 --> 00:42:31.140 align:start position:0%
allergens a nutritional piano a fact
 
00:42:34.250 --> 00:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
panel an opaque child resistant
 
00:42:34.260 --> 00:42:36.770 align:start position:0%

Packaging

00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
Packaging
 
00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:37.550 align:start position:0%
Packaging
um

00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:40.380 align:start position:0%
and on page 16
 
00:42:43.730 --> 00:42:43.740 align:start position:0%
you can see some of the standardized
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
labeling and packaging which is used in
 
00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:49.280 align:start position:0%
other states uh it's quite different
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
obviously Maine and Massachusetts have
 
00:42:54.890 --> 00:42:54.900 align:start position:0%
what they have Washington Nevada
 
00:42:56.990 --> 00:42:57.000 align:start position:0%
Etc everybody's is a little different
 
00:43:01.329 --> 00:43:01.339 align:start position:0%
but there's certainly a call out there
 
00:43:04.790 --> 00:43:04.800 align:start position:0%
a requirement from page 17 a requirement
 
00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:07.460 align:start position:0%
for advertising to include a standard
 
00:43:09.890 --> 00:43:09.900 align:start position:0%
recognizable symbol AS we've shown
 
00:43:13.010 --> 00:43:13.020 align:start position:0%
before a Prohibition on anything that's
 
00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:18.180 align:start position:0%
marketed or is designed of logos you
 
00:43:20.690 --> 00:43:20.700 align:start position:0%
know we do the same thing with liquor we
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
we don't there's there's no labels on
 
00:43:26.329 --> 00:43:26.339 align:start position:0%
our shelves that we feel are child
 
00:43:30.349 --> 00:43:30.359 align:start position:0%
friendly or offensive to the public
 
00:43:32.390 --> 00:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
so anything that you know bubble gum
 
00:43:35.089 --> 00:43:35.099 align:start position:0%
flavored etc etc we can go through that
 
00:43:37.550 --> 00:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
type of thing the testing should also
 
00:43:40.490 --> 00:43:40.500 align:start position:0%
verify the THC and other cannabis
 
00:43:43.490 --> 00:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
potency representative representations
 
00:43:46.490 --> 00:43:46.500 align:start position:0%
on the correct labeling
 
00:43:49.309 --> 00:43:49.319 align:start position:0%
requires all retail stores to inform
 
00:43:52.069 --> 00:43:52.079 align:start position:0%
post informational posters about the
 
00:43:54.170 --> 00:43:54.180 align:start position:0%

Adolescence in younger buyers and the
 
00:44:03.170 --> 00:44:03.180 align:start position:0%

on page 20 the packaging

00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
of cannabis is conducive to an athletic
 
00:45:31.069 --> 00:45:31.079 align:start position:0%
skill or physical prowess or consuming
 
00:45:33.430 --> 00:45:33.440 align:start position:0%
cannabis does not hinder an athlete's
 
00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
performance the packaging or labeling
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
features illustration subject matter
 
00:45:43.450 --> 00:45:43.460 align:start position:0%
Etc are consistent with marketing toward
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
youth or children that would obviously
 
00:45:48.410 --> 00:45:48.420 align:start position:0%
be prohibited
 
00:45:50.630 --> 00:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
the packaging and labeling features
 
00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:53.040 align:start position:0%
consumption of cannabis products while
 
00:45:56.030 --> 00:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
seeded about to enter operating or about
 
00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700 align:start position:0%
to operate an audible deal or machinery
 
00:46:02.750 --> 00:46:02.760 align:start position:0%
and aspects of the packaging labeling
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
normalizes or encourages excessive
 
00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.450 align:start position:0%
normalizes or encourages excessive
consumption

00:46:08.450 --> 00:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
consumption
 
00:46:10.430 --> 00:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
the packaging and labeling does not
 
00:46:12.890 --> 00:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
indicate in a manner significantly clear
 
00:46:15.589 --> 00:46:15.599 align:start position:0%
that the products contain cannabis and
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
cannabis products
 
00:46:19.730 --> 00:46:19.740 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:46:21.890 --> 00:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question with
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
regards to the bullet points about
 
00:46:25.430 --> 00:46:25.440 align:start position:0%
labeling that would not normalize the
 
00:46:27.650 --> 00:46:27.660 align:start position:0%
use of cannabis I do have a concern then
 
00:46:30.710 --> 00:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
by placing a nutrition label onto canvas
 
00:46:33.109 --> 00:46:33.119 align:start position:0%
products that it does in a way normalize
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
it or otherwise suggest that this would
 
00:46:37.069 --> 00:46:37.079 align:start position:0%
be food I understand that part of the
 
00:46:38.930 --> 00:46:38.940 align:start position:0%
reason for placing a nutritional label
 
00:46:40.609 --> 00:46:40.619 align:start position:0%
on there for example a candy bar would
 
00:46:42.230 --> 00:46:42.240 align:start position:0%
be to comply with federal law that we
 
00:46:45.770 --> 00:46:45.780 align:start position:0%
put nutrition labels on food but then
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
we've done cut ourselves in a catch-22
 
00:46:49.309 --> 00:46:49.319 align:start position:0%
we've complied with federal law but not
 
00:46:50.930 --> 00:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
complied with federal law is there a
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
need for a nutrition label on these
 
00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:58.010 align:start position:0%
need for a nutrition label on these
products

00:46:58.010 --> 00:46:58.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:01.370 --> 00:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
to my understanding most of this
 
00:47:04.730 --> 00:47:04.740 align:start position:0%
language has been used by other states I
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
certainly think that you know when you
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
go into a restaurant today they're
 
00:47:11.030 --> 00:47:11.040 align:start position:0%
having you put calorie count you know
 
00:47:14.390 --> 00:47:14.400 align:start position:0%
and all that on even a menu
 
00:47:17.329 --> 00:47:17.339 align:start position:0%
so I'm not 100 sure whether it would
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:47:26.809 --> 00:47:26.819 align:start position:0%
um well we're seeing with these
 
00:47:27.950 --> 00:47:27.960 align:start position:0%
packaging for the Youth we're seeing
 
00:47:30.650 --> 00:47:30.660 align:start position:0%
these m m packages and candies all all
 
00:47:32.569 --> 00:47:32.579 align:start position:0%
across the nation that are literally
 
00:47:35.450 --> 00:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
designed to just attract kids
 
00:47:38.030 --> 00:47:38.040 align:start position:0%
um once you say that even gummies
 
00:47:39.650 --> 00:47:39.660 align:start position:0%
attract kids
 
00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:42.660 align:start position:0%
like a candy
 
00:47:44.690 --> 00:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
I I don't really have an opinion yeah
 
00:47:46.309 --> 00:47:46.319 align:start position:0%
well I can actually tell you that that
 
00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
they don't do dummies anymore so we call
 
00:47:50.390 --> 00:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
them gummies people call them gummies
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
but if you actually look at the product
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
that's sold in these stores
 
00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180 align:start position:0%
they're they're often that triangular
 
00:47:59.329 --> 00:47:59.339 align:start position:0%
shape with it like the Massachusetts has
 
00:48:01.309 --> 00:48:01.319 align:start position:0%
that triangular shape so not they don't
 
00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:04.680 align:start position:0%
have little bears and I think the the
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
point is just because you're selling
 
00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940 align:start position:0%
what is in the shape of a candy bar it
 
00:48:10.609 --> 00:48:10.619 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be labeled and packaged
 
00:48:11.809 --> 00:48:11.819 align:start position:0%
to look like a candy bar on the outside
 
00:48:13.670 --> 00:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
what's on the inside is
 
00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps one one issue but what's on the
 
00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:18.839 align:start position:0%
outside packaging I think is the concern
 
00:48:22.309 --> 00:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
because in the packaging I assume that
 
00:48:24.589 --> 00:48:24.599 align:start position:0%
it shouldn't look like a candy bar in
 
00:48:26.210 --> 00:48:26.220 align:start position:0%
its packaging even if that's what it is
 
00:48:29.290 --> 00:48:29.300 align:start position:0%
in there is that the point
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
so we're borrowing the the look and feel
 
00:48:35.150 --> 00:48:35.160 align:start position:0%
of something even I mean I I'll make
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
sure I get you guys copies of pictures
 
00:48:39.829 --> 00:48:39.839 align:start position:0%
of candy wrappers with that are they're
 
00:48:41.930 --> 00:48:41.940 align:start position:0%
basically marijuana products that is
 
00:48:43.370 --> 00:48:43.380 align:start position:0%
specifically what we're saying we're
 
00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
going to Bar
 
00:48:46.670 --> 00:48:46.680 align:start position:0%
that that specifically the packaging
 
00:48:50.050 --> 00:48:50.060 align:start position:0%
cannot look like or have any confusion
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
with a normal off the you know candy or
 
00:48:54.349 --> 00:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
product off the shelf
 
00:48:56.390 --> 00:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
and and I've seen some of the packaging
 
00:48:58.670 --> 00:48:58.680 align:start position:0%
and it literally looks like something
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
you'd see at a checkout Island in a
 
00:49:02.690 --> 00:49:02.700 align:start position:0%
supermarket so I do find it to be that
 
00:49:04.609 --> 00:49:04.619 align:start position:0%
blatant to be offensive as well but at
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
the same time what's inside of it I'm
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
not sure how you could fix that without
 
00:49:10.790 --> 00:49:10.800 align:start position:0%
barring it all together but at the same
 
00:49:12.950 --> 00:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
time I think the packaging is something
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
we can really focus on both obviously my
 
00:49:17.630 --> 00:49:17.640 align:start position:0%
friends so I'm your current liquor law
 
00:49:22.250 --> 00:49:22.260 align:start position:0%
right now we every label
 
00:49:25.190 --> 00:49:25.200 align:start position:0%
has to be approved by the commission so
 
00:49:27.410 --> 00:49:27.420 align:start position:0%
that is the exact same process that we
 
00:49:29.630 --> 00:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
perceive to be used here which is that
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
when someone is this is a product on the
 
00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:33.780 align:start position:0%
shelf that label has to be approved by
 
00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:35.520 align:start position:0%
the commission to decide whether you can
 
00:49:38.089 --> 00:49:38.099 align:start position:0%
have it in the store and I guess we can
 
00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:41.099 align:start position:0%
ask while we're here perhaps if you have
 
00:49:43.069 --> 00:49:43.079 align:start position:0%
any pictures you want to show anyone on
 
00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:45.060 align:start position:0%
liquid commission whether it's today or
 
00:49:46.910 --> 00:49:46.920 align:start position:0%
another day you can get those out I'll
 
00:49:55.790 --> 00:49:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh packaging versus
 
00:50:02.510 --> 00:50:02.520 align:start position:0%
uh containerization uh has the
 
00:50:04.670 --> 00:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
commission looked at or determined
 
00:50:07.250 --> 00:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
whether or not it was going to impose
 
00:50:10.089 --> 00:50:10.099 align:start position:0%
any child-proof tamper-proof pack
 
00:50:13.849 --> 00:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
containerization for any product
 
00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
yeah in my in my knowledge of all the
 
00:50:19.130 --> 00:50:19.140 align:start position:0%
products I've looked at that's standard
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
operating procedure Chief and and let me
 
00:50:25.069 --> 00:50:25.079 align:start position:0%
just say that this is this is your
 
00:50:27.890 --> 00:50:27.900 align:start position:0%
legislation this these are your rules
 
00:50:30.410 --> 00:50:30.420 align:start position:0%
we're just putting a model in front of
 
00:50:34.130 --> 00:50:34.140 align:start position:0%
you that we feel would be conducive to
 
00:50:36.109 --> 00:50:36.119 align:start position:0%
the health and safety of the people of
 
00:50:38.150 --> 00:50:38.160 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and profitable for the
 
00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:39.720 align:start position:0%
State of New Hampshire
 
00:50:41.809 --> 00:50:41.819 align:start position:0%
in all the stores that I've been in
 
00:50:43.430 --> 00:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
Chief and everything that I've looked at
 
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
everything has uh a tamper-proof seal on
 
00:50:50.930 --> 00:50:50.940 align:start position:0%
it and or a packaging label that says
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
that it contains THC
 
00:50:57.470 --> 00:50:57.480 align:start position:0%
and and I One caveat to that is
 
00:50:59.750 --> 00:50:59.760 align:start position:0%
because the Liquor Commission will be
 
00:51:02.690 --> 00:51:02.700 align:start position:0%
controlled controlling it and the Liquor
 
00:51:05.390 --> 00:51:05.400 align:start position:0%
Commission will be in charge of it any
 
00:51:07.670 --> 00:51:07.680 align:start position:0%
of the product that's manufactured in
 
00:51:10.549 --> 00:51:10.559 align:start position:0%
this state we would control the labeling
 
00:51:13.370 --> 00:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
and we would control how we want the
 
00:51:15.710 --> 00:51:15.720 align:start position:0%
product packaged
 
00:51:17.990 --> 00:51:18.000 align:start position:0%
thank you for my follow-up
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
um yes uh packaging and containerization
 
00:51:22.490 --> 00:51:22.500 align:start position:0%
I think are two separate and distinct
 
00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.690 align:start position:0%
I think are two separate and distinct
issues

00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
issues
 
00:51:26.690 --> 00:51:26.700 align:start position:0%
um are you aware that uh last year uh
 
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Poison Control Center
 
00:51:32.990 --> 00:51:33.000 align:start position:0%
had over 62 cases of um poisoning by
 
00:51:35.390 --> 00:51:35.400 align:start position:0%
cannabis and 19 of those involved
 
00:51:38.089 --> 00:51:38.099 align:start position:0%
juveniles which is the concern for
 
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
ensuring that whatever product is sold
 
00:51:43.730 --> 00:51:43.740 align:start position:0%
that contains THC which could be harmful
 
00:51:47.390 --> 00:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
medically to um particularly for
 
00:51:49.130 --> 00:51:49.140 align:start position:0%
juveniles that it be contained in a
 
00:51:51.010 --> 00:51:51.020 align:start position:0%
proper packaging that is
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:58.790 --> 00:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
my only answer to that Chief would be
 
00:52:01.250 --> 00:52:01.260 align:start position:0%
that I'm fully aware of the harmful
 
00:52:04.490 --> 00:52:04.500 align:start position:0%
nature of not only alcohol but cannabis
 
00:52:07.089 --> 00:52:07.099 align:start position:0%
products and we take our position
 
00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:09.839 align:start position:0%
seriously and that's why we're here
 
00:52:13.130 --> 00:52:13.140 align:start position:0%
today to lay out a model to you that we
 
00:52:14.930 --> 00:52:14.940 align:start position:0%
feel would be best for the State of New
 
00:52:14.940 --> 00:52:18.170 align:start position:0%
feel would be best for the State of New
Hampshire

00:52:18.170 --> 00:52:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.870 --> 00:52:20.880 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question so I
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
just actually on the same line I I'll
 
00:52:24.770 --> 00:52:24.780 align:start position:0%
you know as a parent I also you know
 
00:52:25.910 --> 00:52:25.920 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we have the
 
00:52:27.410 --> 00:52:27.420 align:start position:0%
appropriate controls in place for
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
children absolutely some other states I
 
00:52:33.589 --> 00:52:33.599 align:start position:0%
believe have required or you could
 
00:52:36.829 --> 00:52:36.839 align:start position:0%
consider requiring licenses retail
 
00:52:39.829 --> 00:52:39.839 align:start position:0%
places to sell the lock boxes
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
that's something that the commission
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
might want to consider I don't know if
 
00:52:44.150 --> 00:52:44.160 align:start position:0%
you've considered that looking at other
 
00:52:46.670 --> 00:52:46.680 align:start position:0%
states it would be a helpful thing I
 
00:52:48.530 --> 00:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
think in terms of maintaining child
 
00:52:51.049 --> 00:52:51.059 align:start position:0%
safety so that's both the question and a
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
comment I don't know if you want to say
 
00:52:53.870 --> 00:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
anything about that
 
00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:56.040 align:start position:0%
and I have another question and you can
 
00:52:57.890 --> 00:52:57.900 align:start position:0%
sell the lock boxes in the store yeah
 
00:52:59.690 --> 00:52:59.700 align:start position:0%
and it could be a requirement that they
 
00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:01.740 align:start position:0%
do so I mean we're just sort of thinking
 
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
through about how to address these very
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
very valid concerns about child safety
 
00:53:07.010 --> 00:53:07.020 align:start position:0%
so that's perhaps an option that we
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
require those licenses to do that I have
 
00:53:11.390 --> 00:53:11.400 align:start position:0%
another question
 
00:53:13.849 --> 00:53:13.859 align:start position:0%
this is a very different topic but um
 
00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
also related to safety too I know that
 
00:53:18.109 --> 00:53:18.119 align:start position:0%
there have been a lot of concerns in
 
00:53:20.089 --> 00:53:20.099 align:start position:0%
this state about various you know vape
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
shops New York schools and you know
 
00:53:24.770 --> 00:53:24.780 align:start position:0%
certainly that's an issue that we talk
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
about a lot in New Hampshire is
 
00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:27.890 align:start position:0%
about a lot in New Hampshire is
availability

00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:27.900 align:start position:0%
availability
 
00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:30.180 align:start position:0%
um of those products and so
 
00:53:31.670 --> 00:53:31.680 align:start position:0%
um I just want to ask if you sort of
 
00:53:34.069 --> 00:53:34.079 align:start position:0%
thought through that issue about these
 
00:53:36.290 --> 00:53:36.300 align:start position:0%
dual licenses like would a vape shop
 
00:53:39.049 --> 00:53:39.059 align:start position:0%
then be able to request so is it true
 
00:53:40.549 --> 00:53:40.559 align:start position:0%
that a vape shop has to get a license
 
00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:42.900 align:start position:0%
from you that's correct so would they
 
00:53:45.530 --> 00:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
then could they get another license for
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
cannabis or would there be that
 
00:53:48.890 --> 00:53:48.900 align:start position:0%
separation required that's just a
 
00:53:48.900 --> 00:53:52.750 align:start position:0%
separation required that's just a
question

00:53:52.750 --> 00:53:52.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:57.290 --> 00:53:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.290 --> 00:54:00.300 align:start position:0%
I'm meaning you know if they were
 
00:54:02.329 --> 00:54:02.339 align:start position:0%
it could have a current existing Vape
 
00:54:04.309 --> 00:54:04.319 align:start position:0%
Shop apply to get a license to be one of
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
these franchisees as well
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
uh Senator I'll just go back to this is
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
your legislation and and you'll write
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.809 --> 00:54:17.819 align:start position:0%
I can come in it's okay it's a
 
00:54:17.819 --> 00:54:19.370 align:start position:0%
I can come in it's okay it's a
franchisee

00:54:19.370 --> 00:54:19.380 align:start position:0%
franchisee
 
00:54:22.790 --> 00:54:22.800 align:start position:0%
so know that Vape location could never
 
00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:23.990 align:start position:0%
so know that Vape location could never
be

00:54:23.990 --> 00:54:24.000 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:54:26.450 --> 00:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
one of these franchisees because they
 
00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:27.900 align:start position:0%
would have to tear it down and rebuild
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:37.190 --> 00:54:37.200 align:start position:0%
towards building down made him made
 
00:54:40.130 --> 00:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
itself now in line with the rules that I
 
00:54:43.370 --> 00:54:43.380 align:start position:0%
set by the law and right could they then
 
00:54:47.290 --> 00:54:47.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
that'd be a problem I think that's is
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
that your question well I mean and I and
 
00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700 align:start position:0%
I don't even know so that was a question
 
00:54:55.609 --> 00:54:55.619 align:start position:0%
like I I think we would put in the bill
 
00:54:56.990 --> 00:54:57.000 align:start position:0%
we should put it in the bill that no
 
00:54:58.790 --> 00:54:58.800 align:start position:0%
they cannot sell anything other than
 
00:55:01.910 --> 00:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
marijuana product DHE products we would
 
00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
yeah absolutely we wanted to make it
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
clear that no you could not be getting
 
00:55:09.950 --> 00:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
tobacco or non a non-thc or CBD type
 
00:55:11.870 --> 00:55:11.880 align:start position:0%
product baby but I don't know maybe not
 
00:55:14.210 --> 00:55:14.220 align:start position:0%
CBD either
 
00:55:16.370 --> 00:55:16.380 align:start position:0%
yeah and I was just curious whether you
 
00:55:17.750 --> 00:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
all had thought about that and if you
 
00:55:20.030 --> 00:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
had a position on that in general in
 
00:55:22.430 --> 00:55:22.440 align:start position:0%
terms of safety we don't have a position
 
00:55:24.109 --> 00:55:24.119 align:start position:0%
on it okay thanks
 
00:55:26.270 --> 00:55:26.280 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
00:55:30.349 --> 00:55:30.359 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I understand that
 
00:55:33.290 --> 00:55:33.300 align:start position:0%
the Liquor Commission will be overseeing
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
um the marketing and advertising of the
 
00:55:40.069 --> 00:55:40.079 align:start position:0%
products my question relates to signage
 
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
of your friend franchisees signage can
 
00:55:46.849 --> 00:55:46.859 align:start position:0%
be constituted as advertisement so will
 
00:55:49.549 --> 00:55:49.559 align:start position:0%
there be a requirement uh or oversight
 
00:55:52.270 --> 00:55:52.280 align:start position:0%
by the commission on friendship
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
franchisee signage absolutely there will
 
00:55:58.130 --> 00:55:58.140 align:start position:0%
be okay the only signage that in our
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
opinion that will be allowed outside of
 
00:56:02.930 --> 00:56:02.940 align:start position:0%
the store is the sign that the Liquor
 
00:56:05.089 --> 00:56:05.099 align:start position:0%
Commission will approve that will be
 
00:56:07.910 --> 00:56:07.920 align:start position:0%
standard for all franchisees that says
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
this is a liquor this is a cannabis
 
00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:12.660 align:start position:0%
Outlet I have uh I'll give you a quick
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
idea of what we've done uh basically
 
00:56:18.290 --> 00:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
this will be it
 
00:56:20.450 --> 00:56:20.460 align:start position:0%
this is what will be outside of those
 
00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.370 align:start position:0%
this is what will be outside of those
stores

00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
stores
 
00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.589 align:start position:0%
stores
okay

00:56:24.589 --> 00:56:24.599 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
and there'll be no billboard app much
 
00:56:28.609 --> 00:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
like much like alcohol there'll be no
 
00:56:30.950 --> 00:56:30.960 align:start position:0%
billboard advertising there'll be no
 
00:56:33.290 --> 00:56:33.300 align:start position:0%
advertising outside that says get this
 
00:56:35.750 --> 00:56:35.760 align:start position:0%
here get that there just like our stores
 
00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:37.680 align:start position:0%
this is what you'll see outside of the
 
00:56:40.490 --> 00:56:40.500 align:start position:0%
store you'll see that brand obviously
 
00:56:42.890 --> 00:56:42.900 align:start position:0%
with alcohol uh
 
00:56:45.710 --> 00:56:45.720 align:start position:0%
we have some advertising outside of the
 
00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
stores but very very little with
 
00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
okay uh a couple of questions or a
 
00:56:58.370 --> 00:56:58.380 align:start position:0%
couple of things I'll come up on this
 
00:57:01.010 --> 00:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
I'll start with a familiar one uh beside
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
the signage that the state would approve
 
00:57:04.730 --> 00:57:04.740 align:start position:0%
it would also have to go through the
 
00:57:07.730 --> 00:57:07.740 align:start position:0%
local land use board for advertising
 
00:57:09.349 --> 00:57:09.359 align:start position:0%
because it's not a state they don't have
 
00:57:09.359 --> 00:57:10.329 align:start position:0%
because it's not a state they don't have
the

00:57:10.329 --> 00:57:10.339 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:57:12.710 --> 00:57:12.720 align:start position:0%
state exemption or governmental
 
00:57:12.720 --> 00:57:13.970 align:start position:0%
state exemption or governmental
exemption

00:57:13.970 --> 00:57:13.980 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:57:13.980 --> 00:57:15.230 align:start position:0%
exemption
um

00:57:15.230 --> 00:57:15.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:19.069 --> 00:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
planning board member speaking
 
00:57:19.079 --> 00:57:20.990 align:start position:0%
planning board member speaking
um

00:57:20.990 --> 00:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:24.410 --> 00:57:24.420 align:start position:0%
the nutritional label uh it's probably
 
00:57:26.990 --> 00:57:27.000 align:start position:0%
something that we should retain not
 
00:57:29.390 --> 00:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
because it's a food item because but it
 
00:57:31.790 --> 00:57:31.800 align:start position:0%
specifies the contents of the material
 
00:57:33.710 --> 00:57:33.720 align:start position:0%
and indicates that there has been some
 
00:57:36.049 --> 00:57:36.059 align:start position:0%
testing that has taken place it also
 
00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
helps to delineate whether it's a high
 
00:57:42.290 --> 00:57:42.300 align:start position:0%
THC content or a higher CBD content
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the intended use of the
 
00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:46.790 align:start position:0%
dependent upon the intended use of the
product

00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
product
 
00:57:52.430 --> 00:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
um and from what uh genus of uh cabinet
 
00:57:56.510 --> 00:57:56.520 align:start position:0%
is the product was derived from I think
 
00:57:59.510 --> 00:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's at nutritional label may be the
 
00:58:03.589 --> 00:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
wrong terminology content label maybe a
 
00:58:06.530 --> 00:58:06.540 align:start position:0%
better descriptive term so it does
 
00:58:09.170 --> 00:58:09.180 align:start position:0%
describe it differently as for child
 
00:58:13.370 --> 00:58:13.380 align:start position:0%
proof uh containers uh
 
00:58:16.670 --> 00:58:16.680 align:start position:0%
this uh the the Outline by The Liquor
 
00:58:18.470 --> 00:58:18.480 align:start position:0%
Commission said it would be opaque so
 
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
you're not going to be able to see the
 
00:58:23.170 --> 00:58:23.180 align:start position:0%
quote unquote Gummies at all it's it's
 
00:58:28.370 --> 00:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
merely a uh advertised bag over which
 
00:58:31.010 --> 00:58:31.020 align:start position:0%
that's part of the advertising
 
00:58:33.770 --> 00:58:33.780 align:start position:0%
rules will set up what that advertising
 
00:58:37.549 --> 00:58:37.559 align:start position:0%
can say is on that package I know that
 
00:58:40.789 --> 00:58:40.799 align:start position:0%
some of the packages that present are in
 
00:58:40.799 --> 00:58:42.530 align:start position:0%
some of the packages that present are in
containers

00:58:42.530 --> 00:58:42.540 align:start position:0%
containers
 
00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:43.190 align:start position:0%
containers
um

00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
and some of the packaging is
 
00:58:50.690 --> 00:58:50.700 align:start position:0%
in a foil packaging uh some of the quote
 
00:58:52.430 --> 00:58:52.440 align:start position:0%
unquote candy bars that is chocolate
 
00:58:55.309 --> 00:58:55.319 align:start position:0%
favorite ones don't look like any candy
 
00:59:04.329 --> 00:59:04.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:06.589 --> 00:59:06.599 align:start position:0%
two points one related to the
 
00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
Nutritional labeling I think the what's
 
00:59:09.589 --> 00:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
envisioned here by the nutritional
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
labeling is what's we see on the side of
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
the box of cereal love calories fats and
 
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
I would my point is that this doesn't
 
00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:19.740 align:start position:0%
have nutritional value because I would
 
00:59:21.109 --> 00:59:21.119 align:start position:0%
imagine that most people are eating one
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
block of a candy bar is are probably not
 
00:59:24.650 --> 00:59:24.660 align:start position:0%
going to be worried about the trans fats
 
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
that are in it so we wanted would not
 
00:59:28.730 --> 00:59:28.740 align:start position:0%
imply that this actually is a food item
 
00:59:31.069 --> 00:59:31.079 align:start position:0%
it's closer to a drug or a medical item
 
00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:32.339 align:start position:0%
which is actually what it's used as
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
right now the question that I did have
 
00:59:36.589 --> 00:59:36.599 align:start position:0%
was about the line between rule making
 
00:59:39.710 --> 00:59:39.720 align:start position:0%
and statute and this may be just an open
 
00:59:39.720 --> 00:59:40.789 align:start position:0%
and statute and this may be just an open
question

00:59:40.789 --> 00:59:40.799 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:42.770 --> 00:59:42.780 align:start position:0%
uh a lot of what's been discussed today
 
00:59:44.930 --> 00:59:44.940 align:start position:0%
is our regulations that are going to be
 
00:59:46.490 --> 00:59:46.500 align:start position:0%
created through rule making which is the
 
00:59:48.109 --> 00:59:48.119 align:start position:0%
typical process because we don't want a
 
00:59:50.329 --> 00:59:50.339 align:start position:0%
statue that's 120 pages long
 
00:59:52.970 --> 00:59:52.980 align:start position:0%
however this would create the awkward
 
00:59:55.549 --> 00:59:55.559 align:start position:0%
position in which the franchisor or the
 
00:59:58.789 --> 00:59:58.799 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is also creating the
 
01:00:01.549 --> 01:00:01.559 align:start position:0%
law in enforcing the Law related to its
 
01:00:04.430 --> 01:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
franchise agreement uh while that is the
 
01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
what we're doing it right now with the
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
liquor stores the difficulty becomes now
 
01:00:10.730 --> 01:00:10.740 align:start position:0%
the federalism question at what point do
 
01:00:13.130 --> 01:00:13.140 align:start position:0%
the franchisors their franchisees excuse
 
01:00:16.190 --> 01:00:16.200 align:start position:0%
me become de facto agencies of the state
 
01:00:19.130 --> 01:00:19.140 align:start position:0%
because we exercise so much control
 
01:00:21.170 --> 01:00:21.180 align:start position:0%
through administrative law over those
 
01:00:23.089 --> 01:00:23.099 align:start position:0%
agencies that the federalism issue is
 
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:28.670 --> 01:00:28.680 align:start position:0%
I would say that's a comp compounded
 
01:00:31.010 --> 01:00:31.020 align:start position:0%
legal question that you can probably sit
 
01:00:31.020 --> 01:00:32.690 align:start position:0%
legal question that you can probably sit
five

01:00:32.690 --> 01:00:32.700 align:start position:0%
five
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable Scholars down and you may
 
01:00:37.670 --> 01:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
get five different conclusions
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
maybe even six
 
01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:41.280 align:start position:0%
um there's a couple people illegal
 
01:00:42.829 --> 01:00:42.839 align:start position:0%
background here I would just tell you I
 
01:00:44.690 --> 01:00:44.700 align:start position:0%
still I don't personally I understand
 
01:00:46.910 --> 01:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
there's different levels of control but
 
01:00:49.010 --> 01:00:49.020 align:start position:0%
whether the state's licensing it for a
 
01:00:51.109 --> 01:00:51.119 align:start position:0%
private person to do it or they're
 
01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
selling it themselves directly either
 
01:00:55.549 --> 01:00:55.559 align:start position:0%
way they're facilitating it one way or
 
01:00:58.030 --> 01:00:58.040 align:start position:0%
another obviously there's less control
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
when it's privately done but I still
 
01:01:03.049 --> 01:01:03.059 align:start position:0%
think in order to do this
 
01:01:04.730 --> 01:01:04.740 align:start position:0%
the first step that we're doing we're
 
01:01:07.609 --> 01:01:07.619 align:start position:0%
ignoring federal law and the therapeutic
 
01:01:09.349 --> 01:01:09.359 align:start position:0%
businesses we're ignoring the federal
 
01:01:11.329 --> 01:01:11.339 align:start position:0%
law and then putting this together for
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
the most part at least I'm speaking to
 
01:01:15.049 --> 01:01:15.059 align:start position:0%
myself I'm ignoring federal law because
 
01:01:16.789 --> 01:01:16.799 align:start position:0%
this violates federal law in every
 
01:01:18.650 --> 01:01:18.660 align:start position:0%
aspect possible
 
01:01:20.990 --> 01:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
that's just my my humble opinion so I
 
01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:21.710 align:start position:0%
that's just my my humble opinion so I
think

01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:23.940 align:start position:0%
you're right there's obviously the more
 
01:01:25.430 --> 01:01:25.440 align:start position:0%
the state controls it the more they get
 
01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:26.460 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:01:28.250 --> 01:01:28.260 align:start position:0%
it's implied that they're part of you
 
01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:29.400 align:start position:0%
know they have an agency relationship
 
01:01:29.400 --> 01:01:30.410 align:start position:0%
know they have an agency relationship
but

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:30.420 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:01:32.390 --> 01:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
I mean if if federal law is an issue for
 
01:01:34.789 --> 01:01:34.799 align:start position:0%
anyone well we end as we all understand
 
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
that it's against it so
 
01:01:43.089 --> 01:01:43.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:45.530 --> 01:01:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question has
 
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
there been any consideration to this
 
01:01:47.700 --> 01:01:48.589 align:start position:0%
there been any consideration to this
model

01:01:48.589 --> 01:01:48.599 align:start position:0%
model
 
01:01:50.630 --> 01:01:50.640 align:start position:0%
um if the federal government does decide
 
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
at some point uh to legalize cannabis is
 
01:01:55.490 --> 01:01:55.500 align:start position:0%
there any risk to this model
 
01:01:57.950 --> 01:01:57.960 align:start position:0%
no I would think that it's the least
 
01:02:00.589 --> 01:02:00.599 align:start position:0%
riskiest because the state is separated
 
01:02:03.230 --> 01:02:03.240 align:start position:0%
from it first and foremost and so
 
01:02:05.569 --> 01:02:05.579 align:start position:0%
they're private businesses and if we're
 
01:02:07.490 --> 01:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
allowed to bring product in from out of
 
01:02:09.650 --> 01:02:09.660 align:start position:0%
state and the interstate transportation
 
01:02:12.470 --> 01:02:12.480 align:start position:0%
and things like that are null and void
 
01:02:14.870 --> 01:02:14.880 align:start position:0%
then private businesses remain private
 
01:02:17.089 --> 01:02:17.099 align:start position:0%
and they consider that there's they stay
 
01:02:22.030 --> 01:02:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:24.410 --> 01:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:02:25.970 --> 01:02:25.980 align:start position:0%
um I I was just reading the other day
 
01:02:30.230 --> 01:02:30.240 align:start position:0%
that in New York uh they have a quasi uh
 
01:02:33.829 --> 01:02:33.839 align:start position:0%
State cannabis model as well well I I
 
01:02:36.410 --> 01:02:36.420 align:start position:0%
guess I kind of consider this quasi
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
um if the state won't have liability but
 
01:02:43.010 --> 01:02:43.020 align:start position:0%
the governor hokel is being sued by I
 
01:02:44.990 --> 01:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
think it's six different
 
01:02:48.230 --> 01:02:48.240 align:start position:0%
um harmed parties so it's not the
 
01:02:50.630 --> 01:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
federal government these These are civil
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
suits coming forward and I'm just
 
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
curious if
 
01:02:54.660 --> 01:02:55.370 align:start position:0%
curious if
um

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:55.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:57.530 --> 01:02:57.540 align:start position:0%
if it's called the state of New
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire cannabis outlet and this
 
01:03:04.970 --> 01:03:04.980 align:start position:0%
franchisees who has the liability uh
 
01:03:07.789 --> 01:03:07.799 align:start position:0%
should there be a um you know follow-up
 
01:03:14.049 --> 01:03:14.059 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
let the lawyer answer the question I
 
01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:17.030 align:start position:0%
let the lawyer answer the question I
suppose

01:03:17.030 --> 01:03:17.040 align:start position:0%
suppose
 
01:03:18.890 --> 01:03:18.900 align:start position:0%
um I I don't think you can make that
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
determination now how would you make
 
01:03:22.730 --> 01:03:22.740 align:start position:0%
that determination you know what are
 
01:03:24.109 --> 01:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
these what do these civil suits look
 
01:03:26.150 --> 01:03:26.160 align:start position:0%
like you know it's an impossible
 
01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:27.720 align:start position:0%
question for the Liquor Commission to
 
01:03:29.510 --> 01:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
sort of answer that in a way of which
 
01:03:32.030 --> 01:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
who who's being sued why they being sued
 
01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:33.720 align:start position:0%
what's what is the basis of the lawsuit
 
01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
what are they saying happened where did
 
01:03:38.030 --> 01:03:38.040 align:start position:0%
they say it happened right okay thank
 
01:03:38.040 --> 01:03:39.049 align:start position:0%
they say it happened right okay thank
you

01:03:39.049 --> 01:03:39.059 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:03:41.750 --> 01:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
um being that we're knowingly violating
 
01:03:44.329 --> 01:03:44.339 align:start position:0%
federal law would it be a good idea to
 
01:03:46.010 --> 01:03:46.020 align:start position:0%
bring the Attorney General we have to
 
01:03:50.210 --> 01:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
AGN uh as one of our sub uh focus groups
 
01:03:53.030 --> 01:03:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh to speak to us and answer some of
 
01:03:55.270 --> 01:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
these questions
 
01:03:57.829 --> 01:03:57.839 align:start position:0%
of course anyone from that office is
 
01:04:00.109 --> 01:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
welcome to it at 10 year anytime and we
 
01:04:01.370 --> 01:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
would welcome them here I think it's
 
01:04:03.410 --> 01:04:03.420 align:start position:0%
pretty clear that we're filing federal
 
01:04:05.450 --> 01:04:05.460 align:start position:0%
law so I don't know
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
but we would obviously want to know what
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
what their their opinion is on how this
 
01:04:11.870 --> 01:04:11.880 align:start position:0%
would work if enforcement became an
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
issue but
 
01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
I'm just going to go back to I mean
 
01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
we're filing the therapeutic
 
01:04:20.809 --> 01:04:20.819 align:start position:0%
industry and I'm not picking on them but
 
01:04:22.970 --> 01:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
they are violating federal law as we
 
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
speak and the state pass laws give them
 
01:04:27.470 --> 01:04:27.480 align:start position:0%
licenses and allows them to operate so I
 
01:04:29.690 --> 01:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
guess if we're gonna
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
I still know it kind of gets a little
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
tricky we want to draw a line to say I
 
01:04:34.730 --> 01:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
don't think it's appropriate for the
 
01:04:36.530 --> 01:04:36.540 align:start position:0%
legislator to draw that line and we want
 
01:04:38.569 --> 01:04:38.579 align:start position:0%
to enforce these laws and the FEDS but
 
01:04:40.490 --> 01:04:40.500 align:start position:0%
not this one I mean you want to remain
 
01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:42.470 align:start position:0%
not this one I mean you want to remain
consistent

01:04:42.470 --> 01:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:43.609 align:start position:0%
consistent
okay

01:04:43.609 --> 01:04:43.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:04:47.390 --> 01:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
okay yes thank you Mr chair I uh I don't
 
01:04:49.190 --> 01:04:49.200 align:start position:0%
want to put words in your mouth but what
 
01:04:54.010 --> 01:04:54.020 align:start position:0%
I hear is not necessarily having the he
 
01:04:57.890 --> 01:04:57.900 align:start position:0%
evaluate whether it's uh you know
 
01:04:59.750 --> 01:04:59.760 align:start position:0%
whether we're writing federal law but
 
01:05:01.490 --> 01:05:01.500 align:start position:0%
just exploring
 
01:05:03.470 --> 01:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
you know when we're developing this
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
franchise model exploring the legal
 
01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
issues around that and related to the
 
01:05:09.650 --> 01:05:09.660 align:start position:0%
federalism questions that representative
 
01:05:12.470 --> 01:05:12.480 align:start position:0%
raised is that correct exactly my
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
concern would be where does the
 
01:05:16.730 --> 01:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
liability lie is it would the state or
 
01:05:19.870 --> 01:05:19.880 align:start position:0%
is it with the franchisees and
 
01:05:22.849 --> 01:05:22.859 align:start position:0%
yeah it's a more nuanced question yes
 
01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:25.200 align:start position:0%
and perhaps a recommendation is a
 
01:05:27.530 --> 01:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
strongly worded identification clause in
 
01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:31.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.170 align:start position:0%
 
yes

01:05:33.170 --> 01:05:33.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:34.970 align:start position:0%
yes
chief

01:05:34.970 --> 01:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
chief
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for taking my
 
01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:38.700 align:start position:0%
question for the commission uh with
 
01:05:40.849 --> 01:05:40.859 align:start position:0%
respect to enforcement how many liquor
 
01:05:42.589 --> 01:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers do you currently
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
employee now for liquor enforcement in
 
01:05:54.549 --> 01:05:54.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:58.069 --> 01:05:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh change there are 29 at this current
 
01:06:02.349 --> 01:06:02.359 align:start position:0%
time with sick part-time investigators
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
and uh follow a question if I may uh how
 
01:06:08.150 --> 01:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
many inspectors do you intend to employ
 
01:06:09.950 --> 01:06:09.960 align:start position:0%
on the Cannabis side
 
01:06:12.109 --> 01:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
that I hear 10 early on
 
01:06:15.490 --> 01:06:15.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:18.410 --> 01:06:18.420 align:start position:0%
like we don't know how many stores we're
 
01:06:21.770 --> 01:06:21.780 align:start position:0%
actually going to have so the caveat to
 
01:06:24.170 --> 01:06:24.180 align:start position:0%
that is of course as you lead your
 
01:06:26.390 --> 01:06:26.400 align:start position:0%
Manpower in your organization I do the
 
01:06:29.210 --> 01:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
same with mine so I will have to look at
 
01:06:31.730 --> 01:06:31.740 align:start position:0%
the model and how many stores are
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
actually going to be erected on them to
 
01:06:37.430 --> 01:06:37.440 align:start position:0%
know how many how did the start this is
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
a start out of that number how am I
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
going to read it those that get in
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
number whatever that number
 
01:06:47.569 --> 01:06:47.579 align:start position:0%
so it would be fair to say then that
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
those 10 that would be employed in the
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
Cannabis side would also be required to
 
01:06:56.270 --> 01:06:56.280 align:start position:0%
be engaged in the enforcement of
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
whatever testing and Regulatory actions
 
01:07:01.609 --> 01:07:01.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:05.210 --> 01:07:05.220 align:start position:0%
so without a known quantity in terms of
 
01:07:09.010 --> 01:07:09.020 align:start position:0%
personnel which we all know is is rather
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
expensive today right
 
01:07:14.750 --> 01:07:14.760 align:start position:0%
um with 15 gross sales that you're
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
taking off of the retailers or the
 
01:07:20.569 --> 01:07:20.579 align:start position:0%
franchisees then it's virtually
 
01:07:22.490 --> 01:07:22.500 align:start position:0%
impossible to determine what the cost of
 
01:07:24.770 --> 01:07:24.780 align:start position:0%
Regulation and what that Revenue would
 
01:07:26.390 --> 01:07:26.400 align:start position:0%
be to the state would that be fair to
 
01:07:28.430 --> 01:07:28.440 align:start position:0%
say I think the separate number is a
 
01:07:31.130 --> 01:07:31.140 align:start position:0%
good number compared to the other
 
01:07:31.140 --> 01:07:32.710 align:start position:0%
good number compared to the other
identical

01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
identical
 
01:07:35.829 --> 01:07:35.839 align:start position:0%
models that are out there
 
01:07:38.829 --> 01:07:38.839 align:start position:0%
franchising but
 
01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:41.700 align:start position:0%
when you look at how your standard
 
01:07:44.870 --> 01:07:44.880 align:start position:0%
influence as you do I'm looking at how
 
01:07:47.510 --> 01:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
many stores one investigator can have
 
01:07:50.809 --> 01:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
under its control and have a thorough or
 
01:07:53.569 --> 01:07:53.579 align:start position:0%
have a thorough look at what exactly is
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
going on inspections what they're doing
 
01:07:58.490 --> 01:07:58.500 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis to include everything
 
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
else that the the consumer is doing
 
01:08:04.490 --> 01:08:04.500 align:start position:0%
coming in okay so thank you for your
 
01:08:07.670 --> 01:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
answer and uh but currently the liquor
 
01:08:10.130 --> 01:08:10.140 align:start position:0%
inspectors are not engaged in testing of
 
01:08:12.650 --> 01:08:12.660 align:start position:0%
of product that is being sold correct so
 
01:08:14.329 --> 01:08:14.339 align:start position:0%
they don't they don't go out and would
 
01:08:16.809 --> 01:08:16.819 align:start position:0%
not be engaged in the same testing
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
process on as it would be on the
 
01:08:21.169 --> 01:08:21.179 align:start position:0%
Cannabis side correct
 
01:08:24.169 --> 01:08:24.179 align:start position:0%
so we'd rely on the ttb to do testing on
 
01:08:27.410 --> 01:08:27.420 align:start position:0%
alcohol products just like the FDA on
 
01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:29.699 align:start position:0%
tobacco products we would rely on this
 
01:08:29.699 --> 01:08:31.209 align:start position:0%
tobacco products we would rely on this
independent

01:08:31.209 --> 01:08:31.219 align:start position:0%
independent
 
01:08:31.219 --> 01:08:33.249 align:start position:0%
independent
laboratory

01:08:33.249 --> 01:08:33.259 align:start position:0%
laboratory
 
01:08:37.370 --> 01:08:37.380 align:start position:0%
to do the testing on the Cannabis firms
 
01:08:39.709 --> 01:08:39.719 align:start position:0%
so when the products got to the store
 
01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:41.640 align:start position:0%
Chief they if they they would never get
 
01:08:43.370 --> 01:08:43.380 align:start position:0%
to the store if they hadn't been
 
01:08:45.970 --> 01:08:45.980 align:start position:0%
thoroughly vetted and tested just like
 
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
Bacardi doesn't get to the Shelf unless
 
01:08:50.570 --> 01:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
it's thoroughly vetted and tested nor
 
01:08:53.209 --> 01:08:53.219 align:start position:0%
does any other product new product that
 
01:08:55.610 --> 01:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
comes along and just to back up for a
 
01:08:59.030 --> 01:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
minute uh Tina's done some calculations
 
01:09:03.169 --> 01:09:03.179 align:start position:0%
for me from our standpoint salaries uh
 
01:09:07.430 --> 01:09:07.440 align:start position:0%
would be about 1.75 million yearly for
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
these folks additional folks benefits
 
01:09:12.110 --> 01:09:12.120 align:start position:0%
would be about eight hundred and ten
 
01:09:14.809 --> 01:09:14.819 align:start position:0%
thousand so the liquor commission's uh
 
01:09:17.269 --> 01:09:17.279 align:start position:0%
salary and benefits estimate with what
 
01:09:18.910 --> 01:09:18.920 align:start position:0%
we've put in front of a year is about
 
01:09:22.550 --> 01:09:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner and again that
 
01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:26.870 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner and again that
um

01:09:26.870 --> 01:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
would require regulatory body since
 
01:09:31.849 --> 01:09:31.859 align:start position:0%
you're not relying on the FDA here to
 
01:09:33.349 --> 01:09:33.359 align:start position:0%
test this product that there would be a
 
01:09:35.749 --> 01:09:35.759 align:start position:0%
separate testing regulatory mechanism
 
01:09:37.370 --> 01:09:37.380 align:start position:0%
that the state would have to ensure it
 
01:09:40.010 --> 01:09:40.020 align:start position:0%
would be in place and monitor as has
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
been done in every other state that's
 
01:09:42.769 --> 01:09:42.779 align:start position:0%
done this
 
01:09:42.779 --> 01:09:44.390 align:start position:0%
done this
absolutely

01:09:44.390 --> 01:09:44.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so commission I want
 
01:09:47.450 --> 01:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
to give you a chance to finish your
 
01:09:48.769 --> 01:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
presentation I have a couple questions I
 
01:09:49.910 --> 01:09:49.920 align:start position:0%
want to make sure I'm not sure if you're
 
01:09:52.309 --> 01:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
completely done or not but I will make
 
01:09:54.530 --> 01:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
one comment relative to
 
01:09:57.350 --> 01:09:57.360 align:start position:0%
uh the enforcement pieces that again the
 
01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
Assumption here is 65 maximum stores and
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
with 65 maximum stores 10 employees
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
right so there's a ramp up phase here
 
01:10:04.970 --> 01:10:04.980 align:start position:0%
where we're not going to be at 65 stores
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
on day one so understand there is a
 
01:10:09.169 --> 01:10:09.179 align:start position:0%
there is an adjustment period for lack
 
01:10:10.729 --> 01:10:10.739 align:start position:0%
the better phrase as we start opening
 
01:10:12.229 --> 01:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
and start doing things so is that is
 
01:10:14.450 --> 01:10:14.460 align:start position:0%
that correct that's correct I I can't
 
01:10:18.250 --> 01:10:18.260 align:start position:0%
imagine that we would be at 65 retail
 
01:10:22.130 --> 01:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
outlets uh five to seven years would be
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
my estimate on what that would take
 
01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:26.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so if you if you're finished
 
01:10:28.209 --> 01:10:28.219 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure if you are
 
01:10:32.090 --> 01:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
65 was was Max that's correct that's
 
01:10:38.110 --> 01:10:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:40.010 --> 01:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying the Assumption of
 
01:10:42.709 --> 01:10:42.719 align:start position:0%
the 29 employees a 65 full stores we may
 
01:10:43.910 --> 01:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
not we're not going to get there for a
 
01:10:45.110 --> 01:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
while but
 
01:10:45.120 --> 01:10:46.450 align:start position:0%
while but
um that

01:10:46.450 --> 01:10:46.460 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:10:49.010 --> 01:10:49.020 align:start position:0%
2.56 million dollars is a graduated
 
01:10:50.630 --> 01:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
number that's going to ultimately get
 
01:10:51.709 --> 01:10:51.719 align:start position:0%
there you're saying about five years
 
01:10:54.770 --> 01:10:54.780 align:start position:0%
you're estimating correct correct can I
 
01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
follow up some more questions
 
01:10:59.209 --> 01:10:59.219 align:start position:0%
that so my follow-up to the question was
 
01:11:01.010 --> 01:11:01.020 align:start position:0%
we kind of skipped over if there was a
 
01:11:03.229 --> 01:11:03.239 align:start position:0%
section there about municipalities and
 
01:11:04.850 --> 01:11:04.860 align:start position:0%
what we're doing with municipalities I
 
01:11:06.649 --> 01:11:06.659 align:start position:0%
miss that part of the conversation it
 
01:11:09.169 --> 01:11:09.179 align:start position:0%
was on page
 
01:11:09.179 --> 01:11:13.750 align:start position:0%
was on page
15.

01:11:13.750 --> 01:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
on page 13.
 
01:11:20.330 --> 01:11:20.340 align:start position:0%
so I guess some of my questions revolve
 
01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.470 align:start position:0%
so I guess some of my questions revolve
around

01:11:21.470 --> 01:11:21.480 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:22.970 align:start position:0%
around
um

01:11:22.970 --> 01:11:22.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:25.669 --> 01:11:25.679 align:start position:0%
unlike liquor stores which which means
 
01:11:27.050 --> 01:11:27.060 align:start position:0%
families don't necessarily have a say in
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're a lot they're
 
01:11:29.570 --> 01:11:29.580 align:start position:0%
going to be in there we're going to be
 
01:11:31.310 --> 01:11:31.320 align:start position:0%
allowing municipalities are requiring
 
01:11:34.550 --> 01:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
municipalities to have an opt-in vote to
 
01:11:37.130 --> 01:11:37.140 align:start position:0%
allow for cannabis retailers is that
 
01:11:39.410 --> 01:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
correct that's correct we're also going
 
01:11:41.390 --> 01:11:41.400 align:start position:0%
to allow municipalities to have zoning
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
privileges for lack of a better phrase
 
01:11:45.649 --> 01:11:45.659 align:start position:0%
around those Cannabis stores correct
 
01:11:48.169 --> 01:11:48.179 align:start position:0%
that's correct and your understanding is
 
01:11:49.850 --> 01:11:49.860 align:start position:0%
that you are going to give one percent
 
01:11:53.630 --> 01:11:53.640 align:start position:0%
of the state's portion of the revenue to
 
01:11:55.970 --> 01:11:55.980 align:start position:0%
the municipalities I've chosen to opt-in
 
01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
only not to all municipalities that's
 
01:12:01.490 --> 01:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:06.970 --> 01:12:06.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
and you make Famous Recipe nope that's
 
01:12:12.830 --> 01:12:12.840 align:start position:0%
all we have
 
01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:16.430 align:start position:0%
all we have
um

01:12:16.430 --> 01:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
in your circular like sales to minors in
 
01:12:21.470 --> 01:12:21.480 align:start position:0%
the enforcement side of that obviously
 
01:12:24.070 --> 01:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh you're dealing with the private
 
01:12:26.030 --> 01:12:26.040 align:start position:0%
franchisees now
 
01:12:29.450 --> 01:12:29.460 align:start position:0%
is there any with any comments on having
 
01:12:32.830 --> 01:12:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:34.970 --> 01:12:34.980 align:start position:0%
would have to occur if someone to lose
 
01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
their connections
 
01:12:38.270 --> 01:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
what type would it be like a one strike
 
01:12:39.890 --> 01:12:39.900 align:start position:0%
three-strike system and how would that
 
01:12:41.750 --> 01:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
work with it I'm sure this
 
01:12:43.729 --> 01:12:43.739 align:start position:0%
some some more egregious than others at
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
the violations of that I'm not talking
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
about someone who comes in with an ID
 
01:12:49.610 --> 01:12:49.620 align:start position:0%
and some perhaps it makes it pass you
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
know because it's a big idea I'm talking
 
01:12:51.239 --> 01:12:54.640 align:start position:0%
know because it's a big idea I'm talking
about

01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:54.650 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:54.650 --> 01:12:56.649 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:12:56.649 --> 01:12:56.659 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
well uh you know as far as a one strike
 
01:13:02.750 --> 01:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
two strike three strike that's up to the
 
01:13:05.090 --> 01:13:05.100 align:start position:0%
legislation and the rule that's how that
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
would that's how that would be governed
 
01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:07.729 align:start position:0%
would that's how that would be governed
were

01:13:07.729 --> 01:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
when you know neutral on how we feel
 
01:13:13.430 --> 01:13:13.440 align:start position:0%
whatever whatever you feel is best is is
 
01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
what we put into the rule uh
 
01:13:19.610 --> 01:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
I I don't think that we have uh given
 
01:13:23.870 --> 01:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
given thought to the process of the
 
01:13:26.870 --> 01:13:26.880 align:start position:0%
legislation obviously we want to make
 
01:13:28.490 --> 01:13:28.500 align:start position:0%
sure that
 
01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
anybody who does anything egregious
 
01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
loses their franchise agreement and
 
01:13:36.110 --> 01:13:36.120 align:start position:0%
these will be a valuable asset this is
 
01:13:38.090 --> 01:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
an asset of a business just like any
 
01:13:41.570 --> 01:13:41.580 align:start position:0%
other franchise tool and one of the
 
01:13:44.510 --> 01:13:44.520 align:start position:0%
reasons we're going in this
 
01:13:47.930 --> 01:13:47.940 align:start position:0%
direction is because these these
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
franchise licenses have a value and
 
01:13:53.450 --> 01:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
they're an asset to a business and I
 
01:13:55.790 --> 01:13:55.800 align:start position:0%
don't feel that anybody would put them
 
01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.550 align:start position:0%
don't feel that anybody would put them
In

01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:57.560 align:start position:0%
In
 
01:14:00.950 --> 01:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
Harm's Way given the amount of Revenue
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
that potentially could come from them
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
now as far as where it goes if it's a
 
01:14:08.450 --> 01:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
one strike it's a one strike if it's a
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
two strike it's however it needs to be
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
01:14:16.450 --> 01:14:16.460 align:start position:0%
is there anything actually
 
01:14:19.189 --> 01:14:19.199 align:start position:0%
in respect to alcohol and I guess we'll
 
01:14:22.310 --> 01:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
talk maybe into a think of like a
 
01:14:24.229 --> 01:14:24.239 align:start position:0%
restaurant right now how many how many
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
things would have to occur before the
 
01:14:28.189 --> 01:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
license actually revoked I think it
 
01:14:30.830 --> 01:14:30.840 align:start position:0%
depends on the
 
01:14:33.649 --> 01:14:33.659 align:start position:0%
activity in place obviously
 
01:14:35.870 --> 01:14:35.880 align:start position:0%
you know death resulting are different
 
01:14:39.290 --> 01:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
than a single over service so I think
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
that there's a a huge gamut of of how we
 
01:14:45.770 --> 01:14:45.780 align:start position:0%
look at it it's
 
01:14:49.189 --> 01:14:49.199 align:start position:0%
okay and James is telling me that it's
 
01:14:58.130 --> 01:14:58.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:00.050 --> 01:15:00.060 align:start position:0%
I think related to this question of how
 
01:15:01.850 --> 01:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
many strikes would a licensee need to
 
01:15:03.649 --> 01:15:03.659 align:start position:0%
have before they lost a license perhaps
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
it's more uh analogous to the liquor
 
01:15:09.649 --> 01:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
stores if a liquor store were to engage
 
01:15:11.149 --> 01:15:11.159 align:start position:0%
in a practice that's not allowed by the
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
commission they use others signed each
 
01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:14.520 align:start position:0%
other pricing whatever may be how many
 
01:15:17.570 --> 01:15:17.580 align:start position:0%
times does that franchisee need to poke
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
the bear so to speak before they lose
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
their license well the liquor stores
 
01:15:24.590 --> 01:15:24.600 align:start position:0%
aren't franchise agreements so we own
 
01:15:26.090 --> 01:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
the liquor stores
 
01:15:28.790 --> 01:15:28.800 align:start position:0%
and there's there's rules and and
 
01:15:31.209 --> 01:15:31.219 align:start position:0%
there's uh
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
laws in place there's legislation in
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
place that dictates what we need to do
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
with employees I'm thinking in
 
01:15:39.169 --> 01:15:39.179 align:start position:0%
particular of the agency stores even
 
01:15:40.669 --> 01:15:40.679 align:start position:0%
though there aren't that many left this
 
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
is probably most analogous to those at
 
01:15:45.350 --> 01:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
what point what an agency store get
 
01:15:47.570 --> 01:15:47.580 align:start position:0%
pulled even though it's unlikely the
 
01:15:49.669 --> 01:15:49.679 align:start position:0%
agency stores are reviewed on a yearly
 
01:15:52.970 --> 01:15:52.980 align:start position:0%
basis so much like uh these franchise
 
01:15:56.209 --> 01:15:56.219 align:start position:0%
agreements those licenses are reviewed
 
01:15:58.910 --> 01:15:58.920 align:start position:0%
on a yearly basis so at the end of the
 
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
year if you have if you haven't been a
 
01:16:03.890 --> 01:16:03.900 align:start position:0%
good operator potentially could you lose
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
your license and I don't want to speak
 
01:16:09.890 --> 01:16:09.900 align:start position:0%
for the outline but it's all outlined in
 
01:16:12.590 --> 01:16:12.600 align:start position:0%
Rural and legislation as to what we do
 
01:16:12.600 --> 01:16:17.270 align:start position:0%
Rural and legislation as to what we do
foreign

01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.770 --> 01:16:18.780 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:16:19.970 --> 01:16:19.980 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I've had the
 
01:16:21.290 --> 01:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
privilege of meeting some of your liquor
 
01:16:23.330 --> 01:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
investigators they've come spoke to the
 
01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
Raymond Coalition for Youth and do stuff
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
with our town all the time and so I I've
 
01:16:28.910 --> 01:16:28.920 align:start position:0%
seen what they do when they go out and
 
01:16:30.229 --> 01:16:30.239 align:start position:0%
they're investigating
 
01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
um you know say a sale to a minor or
 
01:16:36.649 --> 01:16:36.659 align:start position:0%
over service so what what what can we
 
01:16:38.270 --> 01:16:38.280 align:start position:0%
put in place or what do you suggest we
 
01:16:40.310 --> 01:16:40.320 align:start position:0%
put in place like I mean obviously we
 
01:16:41.870 --> 01:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to be selling marijuana to
 
01:16:43.669 --> 01:16:43.679 align:start position:0%
any minors
 
01:16:47.390 --> 01:16:47.400 align:start position:0%
um so as for liquor what's the penalty
 
01:16:49.250 --> 01:16:49.260 align:start position:0%
when you catch a store selling to minors
 
01:16:49.260 --> 01:16:50.149 align:start position:0%
when you catch a store selling to minors
and

01:16:50.149 --> 01:16:50.159 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:16:51.770 --> 01:16:51.780 align:start position:0%
like how how
 
01:16:53.750 --> 01:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
um like when do they lose their license
 
01:16:55.970 --> 01:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
or our ability to sell alcohol well
 
01:16:59.570 --> 01:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
again it depends on the the severity of
 
01:17:01.850 --> 01:17:01.860 align:start position:0%
what happens there's nothing that's it's
 
01:17:04.430 --> 01:17:04.440 align:start position:0%
all different levels in different stages
 
01:17:06.050 --> 01:17:06.060 align:start position:0%
and as far as
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
you know our thoughts on what the
 
01:17:12.530 --> 01:17:12.540 align:start position:0%
legislation should look like I have no
 
01:17:14.689 --> 01:17:14.699 align:start position:0%
idea what the legislation should look
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
like that's something that I think that
 
01:17:20.090 --> 01:17:20.100 align:start position:0%
has to be a much broader discussion
 
01:17:22.490 --> 01:17:22.500 align:start position:0%
yeah so I want to intervene on this
 
01:17:24.169 --> 01:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
because we actually had this bill in my
 
01:17:25.610 --> 01:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
committee right now
 
01:17:27.649 --> 01:17:27.659 align:start position:0%
okay we have an over serving uh
 
01:17:30.410 --> 01:17:30.420 align:start position:0%
legislation so what I want to say is is
 
01:17:32.630 --> 01:17:32.640 align:start position:0%
that the the department has rules
 
01:17:32.640 --> 01:17:34.070 align:start position:0%
that the the department has rules
already

01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
um there is a thorough investigation in
 
01:17:38.630 --> 01:17:38.640 align:start position:0%
any any violation and yes there is a
 
01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
step system we do currently have so I
 
01:17:43.430 --> 01:17:43.440 align:start position:0%
would think that one of our breakouts
 
01:17:46.370 --> 01:17:46.380 align:start position:0%
has one of our sessions could be is to a
 
01:17:48.890 --> 01:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
take that what we're working on and as a
 
01:17:50.270 --> 01:17:50.280 align:start position:0%
matter of fact we're actually changing
 
01:17:52.790 --> 01:17:52.800 align:start position:0%
looking at the rules right now A take
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
that but B look at other states and see
 
01:17:57.290 --> 01:17:57.300 align:start position:0%
what they have done in terms of their
 
01:18:00.470 --> 01:18:00.480 align:start position:0%
violations of of the of you know of over
 
01:18:03.530 --> 01:18:03.540 align:start position:0%
in the in the case of selling to someone
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
as a underage
 
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to say over someone's been
 
01:18:09.649 --> 01:18:09.659 align:start position:0%
over served
 
01:18:12.290 --> 01:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
um keep in mind that the biggest
 
01:18:14.590 --> 01:18:14.600 align:start position:0%
violators of our regulations
 
01:18:17.270 --> 01:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
are the on-premise
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
the the restaurants and we don't have
 
01:18:21.350 --> 01:18:21.360 align:start position:0%
any of those
 
01:18:22.550 --> 01:18:22.560 align:start position:0%
you know we don't you don't have
 
01:18:24.410 --> 01:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
on-premise you know all those licensees
 
01:18:26.630 --> 01:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
that that all those Regulators all those
 
01:18:28.669 --> 01:18:28.679 align:start position:0%
guys enforcement are going we don't have
 
01:18:30.830 --> 01:18:30.840 align:start position:0%
any of those in this legislation so you
 
01:18:32.510 --> 01:18:32.520 align:start position:0%
know I mean that takes out a big chunk
 
01:18:34.669 --> 01:18:34.679 align:start position:0%
of what the problems are but I think
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
that this is worth
 
01:18:37.669 --> 01:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
um a
 
01:18:39.770 --> 01:18:39.780 align:start position:0%
sessions just to look at what those
 
01:18:41.390 --> 01:18:41.400 align:start position:0%
penalties are because that's an
 
01:18:43.250 --> 01:18:43.260 align:start position:0%
important issue that needs to be
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
addressed what what will be the
 
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
violations so the franchisees need to
 
01:18:49.850 --> 01:18:49.860 align:start position:0%
know up front and the legislature has
 
01:18:52.610 --> 01:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
spoken and weighed in on exactly uh how
 
01:18:53.930 --> 01:18:53.940 align:start position:0%
many times they can screw up before they
 
01:18:56.270 --> 01:18:56.280 align:start position:0%
lose their franchisee I agree there's
 
01:18:58.550 --> 01:18:58.560 align:start position:0%
also a branding issue because these
 
01:19:00.770 --> 01:19:00.780 align:start position:0%
franchise franchisees are all going to
 
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
be operating on the same logo so you
 
01:19:03.649 --> 01:19:03.659 align:start position:0%
have one or two
 
01:19:06.890 --> 01:19:06.900 align:start position:0%
that are we should say run poorly
 
01:19:08.450 --> 01:19:08.460 align:start position:0%
you can perhaps hurt the ones that are
 
01:19:09.610 --> 01:19:09.620 align:start position:0%
being run
 
01:19:12.110 --> 01:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
you know following all the rules and I
 
01:19:13.490 --> 01:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
think at the time because we have a
 
01:19:14.450 --> 01:19:14.460 align:start position:0%
brand right now that doesn't have any
 
01:19:16.610 --> 01:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
brand identity so I think it's important
 
01:19:19.970 --> 01:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
to maybe so yeah so when the Liquor
 
01:19:21.950 --> 01:19:21.960 align:start position:0%
Commission does do these things for
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
under under the under 8 21. they usually
 
01:19:27.229 --> 01:19:27.239 align:start position:0%
if there's a liquor store in that
 
01:19:29.270 --> 01:19:29.280 align:start position:0%
Community the day are part of that sting
 
01:19:31.729 --> 01:19:31.739 align:start position:0%
so that they're not they they don't get
 
01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:34.800 align:start position:0%
out and but yes if if an employee if a
 
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
liquor store wherever to do it and I
 
01:19:38.510 --> 01:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
don't think I've ever heard of a case
 
01:19:40.490 --> 01:19:40.500 align:start position:0%
but yeah they get fired on the spot
 
01:19:43.310 --> 01:19:43.320 align:start position:0%
right because they would be damaging our
 
01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
reputation in this case I guess
 
01:19:50.709 --> 01:19:50.719 align:start position:0%
the retail store wouldn't be an employee
 
01:19:54.290 --> 01:19:54.300 align:start position:0%
right exactly but I I assume that person
 
01:19:56.590 --> 01:19:56.600 align:start position:0%
would be fired anyway but that's that's
 
01:19:59.510 --> 01:19:59.520 align:start position:0%
I would imagine the discussion first
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
everything that we do is done by a
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
legislative process
 
01:20:05.689 --> 01:20:05.699 align:start position:0%
so and it's correct that it's a it's a
 
01:20:08.750 --> 01:20:08.760 align:start position:0%
step process but in writing a franchise
 
01:20:08.760 --> 01:20:09.970 align:start position:0%
step process but in writing a franchise
agreement

01:20:09.970 --> 01:20:09.980 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:20:13.189 --> 01:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
that's where you would cover this to say
 
01:20:15.709 --> 01:20:15.719 align:start position:0%
if you have an employee that does this
 
01:20:18.169 --> 01:20:18.179 align:start position:0%
this is what needs to happen if you have
 
01:20:20.330 --> 01:20:20.340 align:start position:0%
an employee that does that this is what
 
01:20:22.310 --> 01:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
needs to happen but I do think we should
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
probably cover I agree I have that
 
01:20:25.850 --> 01:20:25.860 align:start position:0%
resolved but that's this legislation
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
that's something that comes out of the
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
committee that uh engages us to write
 
01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
the franchise agreement the way we feel
 
01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:34.739 align:start position:0%
it needs to be written
 
01:20:37.250 --> 01:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
the way you all feel it needs the way it
 
01:20:39.410 --> 01:20:39.420 align:start position:0%
needs to be written thank you thank you
 
01:20:41.090 --> 01:20:41.100 align:start position:0%
Mr chair so
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
um again I I you have history in doing
 
01:20:45.050 --> 01:20:45.060 align:start position:0%
this enforcement obviously with all your
 
01:20:47.149 --> 01:20:47.159 align:start position:0%
licenses how many liquor licensees do we
 
01:20:49.189 --> 01:20:49.199 align:start position:0%
have in the state of New Hampshire 6100
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
so 6100 agency you know organizations
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
are already we're talking about 65 here
 
01:20:57.709 --> 01:20:57.719 align:start position:0%
so maximum 65. so you have
 
01:20:59.750 --> 01:20:59.760 align:start position:0%
um already experience in dealing with
 
01:21:02.870 --> 01:21:02.880 align:start position:0%
what is a low moderate and severe uh
 
01:21:05.209 --> 01:21:05.219 align:start position:0%
violation and and suspending those
 
01:21:07.669 --> 01:21:07.679 align:start position:0%
licensees which I you do on a fairly
 
01:21:09.350 --> 01:21:09.360 align:start position:0%
regular basis you know when you find a
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
incident so I think we're in the right
 
01:21:13.729 --> 01:21:13.739 align:start position:0%
agency to manage that I also know that
 
01:21:15.709 --> 01:21:15.719 align:start position:0%
we identify the same exact thing in in
 
01:21:17.209 --> 01:21:17.219 align:start position:0%
our charitable gaming organizations
 
01:21:19.130 --> 01:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
right we have when you can suspend a
 
01:21:20.510 --> 01:21:20.520 align:start position:0%
charitable gaming license we have
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
controls and conditions for that as well
 
01:21:24.830 --> 01:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
as to when charitable gaming operator's
 
01:21:28.010 --> 01:21:28.020 align:start position:0%
license is suspended so I think that um
 
01:21:30.229 --> 01:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
it's it's the right place I think I'll
 
01:21:32.270 --> 01:21:32.280 align:start position:0%
utilize some of the same exact rules I'm
 
01:21:34.610 --> 01:21:34.620 align:start position:0%
assuming it just modified to met deal
 
01:21:36.050 --> 01:21:36.060 align:start position:0%
with marijuana versus Liquors is that
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
fair to say that's fair to say thank you
 
01:21:40.090 --> 01:21:40.100 align:start position:0%
very much and
 
01:21:43.490 --> 01:21:43.500 align:start position:0%
1250 or so of those licenses are out of
 
01:21:45.950 --> 01:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
state licenses so we're one of the 13
 
01:21:49.729 --> 01:21:49.739 align:start position:0%
states that allows uh wine to be shipped
 
01:21:51.830 --> 01:21:51.840 align:start position:0%
into the state as well that has to be
 
01:21:53.570 --> 01:21:53.580 align:start position:0%
monitored by The Liquor Commission as
 
01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:54.530 align:start position:0%
monitored by The Liquor Commission as
well

01:21:54.530 --> 01:21:54.540 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:21:57.530 --> 01:21:57.540 align:start position:0%
thank you how you doing good question
 
01:21:59.149 --> 01:21:59.159 align:start position:0%
for you certainly
 
01:22:01.370 --> 01:22:01.380 align:start position:0%
um and it's maybe I'm not there so I see
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
the 15 gross months monthly sales that's
 
01:22:04.800 --> 01:22:05.990 align:start position:0%
the 15 gross months monthly sales that's
good

01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
good
 
01:22:08.810 --> 01:22:08.820 align:start position:0%
um are we not selling how much is this
 
01:22:11.030 --> 01:22:11.040 align:start position:0%
license going to cost so if I'm the guy
 
01:22:12.830 --> 01:22:12.840 align:start position:0%
who gets the dairy license that's worth
 
01:22:15.770 --> 01:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
a lot of money to me and are we like the
 
01:22:19.790 --> 01:22:19.800 align:start position:0%
liquor licenses are 175 to 500 this
 
01:22:22.310 --> 01:22:22.320 align:start position:0%
seems like geez I should be a cabbies
 
01:22:24.050 --> 01:22:24.060 align:start position:0%
license in New York is a million dollars
 
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
shouldn't I be getting a big bundle up
 
01:22:28.430 --> 01:22:28.440 align:start position:0%
front when I'm giving someone a
 
01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
franchise agreement if I was getting a
 
01:22:31.729 --> 01:22:31.739 align:start position:0%
Burger King I'd have to pay two three
 
01:22:34.010 --> 01:22:34.020 align:start position:0%
million dollars absolutely we'd be
 
01:22:35.510 --> 01:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
getting a bundle of money from every
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
franchise eight well on top of what I'm
 
01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
saying absolutely and I completely agree
 
01:22:43.370 --> 01:22:43.380 align:start position:0%
we I have looked at it a couple of
 
01:22:46.550 --> 01:22:46.560 align:start position:0%
different ways but I think that uh
 
01:22:48.410 --> 01:22:48.420 align:start position:0%
obviously it will be an asset of the
 
01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
business and obviously it'll it'll have
 
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
a salable value and the longer the
 
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
longer the business runs the more the
 
01:22:58.490 --> 01:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
vet the more value of that asset is
 
01:23:02.030 --> 01:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
worth uh the idea is uh twenty five
 
01:23:03.890 --> 01:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars for the license for the
 
01:23:07.010 --> 01:23:07.020 align:start position:0%
first year uh they'll obviously be a fee
 
01:23:10.370 --> 01:23:10.380 align:start position:0%
to apply for the license you'll have to
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
be a good sound character
 
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:17.219 align:start position:0%
Financial financially solvent
 
01:23:23.950 --> 01:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
etc etc year 2 12 5 year 3 6250 year 4
 
01:23:26.830 --> 01:23:26.840 align:start position:0%
31.25 and year five and beyond that
 
01:23:29.930 --> 01:23:29.940 align:start position:0%
twenty five hundred dollars a year so
 
01:23:32.750 --> 01:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
the licenses would be twenty five
 
01:23:34.370 --> 01:23:34.380 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a piece for the first
 
01:23:34.380 --> 01:23:39.530 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars a piece for the first
year

01:23:39.530 --> 01:23:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:43.850 --> 01:23:43.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:49.550 --> 01:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
an absolute the the the build out for uh
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
a facility to manufacture is would be a
 
01:23:54.770 --> 01:23:54.780 align:start position:0%
minimum of a million dollars probably
 
01:23:57.649 --> 01:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
closer to three to two manufacturing
 
01:24:00.470 --> 01:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
growing but the retail exactly I would
 
01:24:03.169 --> 01:24:03.179 align:start position:0%
figure somewhere between 750
 
01:24:05.510 --> 01:24:05.520 align:start position:0%
000 and a million two depending on the
 
01:24:08.450 --> 01:24:08.460 align:start position:0%
size of your store to build out and that
 
01:24:11.689 --> 01:24:11.699 align:start position:0%
will as far as we are concerned we will
 
01:24:14.810 --> 01:24:14.820 align:start position:0%
do an RFP for all of the furniture and
 
01:24:17.750 --> 01:24:17.760 align:start position:0%
fixture so you go into any store they
 
01:24:19.729 --> 01:24:19.739 align:start position:0%
absolutely look the same just like when
 
01:24:21.770 --> 01:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
you go into our liquor Outlets all the
 
01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
ones that we've redone have a look and a
 
01:24:26.689 --> 01:24:26.699 align:start position:0%
feel and they will no one will be able
 
01:24:28.610 --> 01:24:28.620 align:start position:0%
to open a store
 
01:24:32.630 --> 01:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
or sell a product until obviously we
 
01:24:34.910 --> 01:24:34.920 align:start position:0%
inspect it and the process has gone
 
01:24:36.470 --> 01:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
through where they buy the product
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
through the vendor that's chosen by the
 
01:24:41.930 --> 01:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission and or vendors that
 
01:24:44.450 --> 01:24:44.460 align:start position:0%
are chosen by the Liquor Commission
 
01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
in respect to all the stores looking the
 
01:24:48.950 --> 01:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
same I and I I totally agree with the
 
01:24:51.530 --> 01:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
franchise model that's how it should go
 
01:24:54.229 --> 01:24:54.239 align:start position:0%
the only I think maybe
 
01:24:56.390 --> 01:24:56.400 align:start position:0%
odd issue you may run into is the
 
01:24:58.250 --> 01:24:58.260 align:start position:0%
therapeutic industry if one of those
 
01:25:01.250 --> 01:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
entities were let's say apply for the
 
01:25:04.970 --> 01:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
franchise and then obtain it
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
would their facility have to change they
 
01:25:08.330 --> 01:25:08.340 align:start position:0%
have to have a separate retail store how
 
01:25:10.310 --> 01:25:10.320 align:start position:0%
would that unfold
 
01:25:13.729 --> 01:25:13.739 align:start position:0%
and that's that's an area well I I think
 
01:25:16.910 --> 01:25:16.920 align:start position:0%
that if they're going to have a retail
 
01:25:19.310 --> 01:25:19.320 align:start position:0%
end of it or would have to mirror the
 
01:25:21.530 --> 01:25:21.540 align:start position:0%
outlet model if they had a therapeutic
 
01:25:23.689 --> 01:25:23.699 align:start position:0%
part of the business that would be one
 
01:25:26.149 --> 01:25:26.159 align:start position:0%
thing and and the retail model would
 
01:25:27.770 --> 01:25:27.780 align:start position:0%
have to would have to mirror it
 
01:25:30.110 --> 01:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
obviously could only could be a portion
 
01:25:31.790 --> 01:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
of what they have it could be something
 
01:25:33.890 --> 01:25:33.900 align:start position:0%
that's divided and they could have a
 
01:25:36.649 --> 01:25:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:38.270 --> 01:25:38.280 align:start position:0%
so there would be some sort of an
 
01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:39.470 align:start position:0%
so there would be some sort of an
expense

01:25:39.470 --> 01:25:39.480 align:start position:0%
expense
 
01:25:40.790 --> 01:25:40.800 align:start position:0%
there you go
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
Mr jackass I was gonna actually had
 
01:25:44.630 --> 01:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
notes to make sure we involve maybe
 
01:25:46.850 --> 01:25:46.860 align:start position:0%
bring DHHS to the next meeting to see
 
01:25:50.330 --> 01:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
how in a ATC how it could possibly
 
01:25:51.950 --> 01:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
become a retail store on what that would
 
01:25:53.750 --> 01:25:53.760 align:start position:0%
look like in order to keep our medical
 
01:25:58.910 --> 01:25:58.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:58.920 --> 01:26:00.290 align:start position:0%
 
chief

01:26:00.290 --> 01:26:00.300 align:start position:0%
chief
 
01:26:01.790 --> 01:26:01.800 align:start position:0%
and thank you Mr chair not a question
 
01:26:04.610 --> 01:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
but a comment just circling back to
 
01:26:08.149 --> 01:26:08.159 align:start position:0%
um the penalty discussion that my
 
01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:10.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation would be that
 
01:26:12.110 --> 01:26:12.120 align:start position:0%
um there would be a focus meeting or a
 
01:26:15.649 --> 01:26:15.659 align:start position:0%
group that looks at fine penalties uh to
 
01:26:18.169 --> 01:26:18.179 align:start position:0%
ensure compliance with respect to not
 
01:26:20.330 --> 01:26:20.340 align:start position:0%
only the dispensation but also because
 
01:26:23.570 --> 01:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
the state's engaged in purchasing that
 
01:26:23.580 --> 01:26:24.610 align:start position:0%
the state's engaged in purchasing that
it

01:26:24.610 --> 01:26:24.620 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:26:27.169 --> 01:26:27.179 align:start position:0%
enveloped the entire regulatory process
 
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
to ensure compliance
 
01:26:32.750 --> 01:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
so more than just franchisee compliance
 
01:26:35.510 --> 01:26:35.520 align:start position:0%
but there would be growing testing
 
01:26:38.030 --> 01:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
compliance and so forth as part of the
 
01:26:40.910 --> 01:26:40.920 align:start position:0%
penalty structure of fine and fee
 
01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:42.370 align:start position:0%
penalty structure of fine and fee
foreign

01:26:42.370 --> 01:26:42.380 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:26:45.530 --> 01:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have a I just
 
01:26:47.750 --> 01:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to follow up to Senator Whitley
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
spoke earlier about the surge in
 
01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:52.739 align:start position:0%
childhood poisoning so this is a child
 
01:26:54.770 --> 01:26:54.780 align:start position:0%
safety issue
 
01:26:57.950 --> 01:26:57.960 align:start position:0%
um I I realize that we have a the
 
01:27:00.050 --> 01:27:00.060 align:start position:0%
warning labels which is you know
 
01:27:02.030 --> 01:27:02.040 align:start position:0%
basically Keep Out Of Reach of children
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
uh there's I I know currently with the
 
01:27:09.010 --> 01:27:09.020 align:start position:0%
ATC we have an ATC in in Plymouth it's
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
ineffective in in many situations we had
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
two years ago we had four toddlers in
 
01:27:20.390 --> 01:27:20.400 align:start position:0%
our local Ed in THC induced Comas so
 
01:27:22.790 --> 01:27:22.800 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about here is edible
 
01:27:27.890 --> 01:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
products with high THC content updates
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I know we're going we'll we'll be
 
01:27:31.370 --> 01:27:31.380 align:start position:0%
bringing in some subject matter experts
 
01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
from other states that have legalized my
 
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
question is is I'm not even sure if we
 
01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:37.610 align:start position:0%
question is is I'm not even sure if we
can

01:27:37.610 --> 01:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
can
 
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.020 align:start position:0%
um at this point in time find this
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
information but what products
 
01:27:45.649 --> 01:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming they're Edibles we're not
 
01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:47.940 align:start position:0%
going to see for four-year-olds vaping
 
01:27:50.870 --> 01:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
oh two-year-olds
 
01:27:53.629 --> 01:27:53.639 align:start position:0%
um so they must be like brownies or
 
01:27:56.510 --> 01:27:56.520 align:start position:0%
gummies or something along that line is
 
01:27:58.610 --> 01:27:58.620 align:start position:0%
there any way we can revisit current
 
01:28:02.810 --> 01:28:02.820 align:start position:0%
legislation with the atcs and also in
 
01:28:05.270 --> 01:28:05.280 align:start position:0%
designing this legislation we look to
 
01:28:07.310 --> 01:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
child safety in in limiting those
 
01:28:09.350 --> 01:28:09.360 align:start position:0%
products if we can determine what they
 
01:28:12.649 --> 01:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
are that our young children Toddlers and
 
01:28:15.050 --> 01:28:15.060 align:start position:0%
young children are attracted to and and
 
01:28:18.649 --> 01:28:18.659 align:start position:0%
ingesting so it obviously it'll have an
 
01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
impact on profitability but
 
01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:22.310 align:start position:0%
impact on profitability but
um

01:28:22.310 --> 01:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:24.830 --> 01:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
we can't put a cost on our on all young
 
01:28:27.530 --> 01:28:27.540 align:start position:0%
children's lives at some point we're
 
01:28:30.649 --> 01:28:30.659 align:start position:0%
going to lose a child and so we we need
 
01:28:31.850 --> 01:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
to look at
 
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
look at this as we're investigating it
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
um to limit these products so in respect
 
01:28:41.510 --> 01:28:41.520 align:start position:0%
to regulating or addressing some of the
 
01:28:43.310 --> 01:28:43.320 align:start position:0%
regulations that apply the atcs I think
 
01:28:44.810 --> 01:28:44.820 align:start position:0%
that's a somewhat outside the scope of
 
01:28:46.490 --> 01:28:46.500 align:start position:0%
the commission I know it's something
 
01:28:48.950 --> 01:28:48.960 align:start position:0%
important it's an important issue for us
 
01:28:50.629 --> 01:28:50.639 align:start position:0%
with the goal here is to really set up
 
01:28:52.790 --> 01:28:52.800 align:start position:0%
this way forward the state-run model but
 
01:28:55.010 --> 01:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
I think the rules are regulations that
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
we would support in helping Implement
 
01:28:58.490 --> 01:28:58.500 align:start position:0%
that state-run model could certainly
 
01:29:00.649 --> 01:29:00.659 align:start position:0%
address what I would say would be the
 
01:29:00.659 --> 01:29:01.310 align:start position:0%
address what I would say would be the
the

01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:01.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:29:03.770 --> 01:29:03.780 align:start position:0%
what we would want that to be and I
 
01:29:05.390 --> 01:29:05.400 align:start position:0%
would certainly encourage the atcs to
 
01:29:07.850 --> 01:29:07.860 align:start position:0%
take notice of what that is okay thank
 
01:29:10.189 --> 01:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
you so
 
01:29:12.649 --> 01:29:12.659 align:start position:0%
descriptions Alden
 
01:29:14.149 --> 01:29:14.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yeah I have a few questions
 
01:29:16.669 --> 01:29:16.679 align:start position:0%
here so when you're talking about the
 
01:29:19.129 --> 01:29:19.139 align:start position:0%
licensing of the respective franchise
 
01:29:19.139 --> 01:29:21.709 align:start position:0%
licensing of the respective franchise
franchises

01:29:21.709 --> 01:29:21.719 align:start position:0%
franchises
 
01:29:23.330 --> 01:29:23.340 align:start position:0%
I get sort of visions of sort of The
 
01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:25.260 align:start position:0%
Medallion system like he like uh Senator
 
01:29:27.590 --> 01:29:27.600 align:start position:0%
again said so do you envision that as
 
01:29:29.209 --> 01:29:29.219 align:start position:0%
you charge a fee and then that person
 
01:29:31.430 --> 01:29:31.440 align:start position:0%
owns it or is it just simply
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
and then they own it and they can like
 
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
transfer it through and sell it to
 
01:29:35.750 --> 01:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
somebody if they wanted to in a way that
 
01:29:37.250 --> 01:29:37.260 align:start position:0%
I could sell my house or do you view it
 
01:29:38.870 --> 01:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
as this is the licensing fee that you
 
01:29:41.390 --> 01:29:41.400 align:start position:0%
have and then if I exit the business I
 
01:29:42.470 --> 01:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
can't sell to somebody else but I have
 
01:29:44.570 --> 01:29:44.580 align:start position:0%
to give it back to you guys to reuse
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
no the license you'd own the license you
 
01:29:49.250 --> 01:29:49.260 align:start position:0%
would on the license that's right
 
01:29:51.770 --> 01:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
franchise you don't the franchisee would
 
01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
own the license now in the franchisee
 
01:29:55.970 --> 01:29:55.980 align:start position:0%
goes to sell the license obviously
 
01:29:58.550 --> 01:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
whoever purchases it has to go through
 
01:30:00.830 --> 01:30:00.840 align:start position:0%
the approval process again
 
01:30:04.430 --> 01:30:04.440 align:start position:0%
and start with the process of paying for
 
01:30:07.610 --> 01:30:07.620 align:start position:0%
the license again okay so if that
 
01:30:10.910 --> 01:30:10.920 align:start position:0%
license today you sell it to them for 25
 
01:30:13.070 --> 01:30:13.080 align:start position:0%
000 or whatever you settle on and they
 
01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
listed out a bunch of numbers then if
 
01:30:17.930 --> 01:30:17.940 align:start position:0%
that becomes if this becomes like just a
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
booming industry that license becomes
 
01:30:21.110 --> 01:30:21.120 align:start position:0%
worth a million dollars that's my
 
01:30:22.970 --> 01:30:22.980 align:start position:0%
million dollar asset that follows me
 
01:30:29.649 --> 01:30:29.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:32.330 --> 01:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
okay and then
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
um we've talked a lot about the stores
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
but like how do you envision the the
 
01:30:40.070 --> 01:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
regulation of who gets to like produce
 
01:30:41.990 --> 01:30:42.000 align:start position:0%
it grow it and then manufacture so is
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
there going to be and then distribution
 
01:30:46.070 --> 01:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
I guess so are you guys in charge of
 
01:30:47.330 --> 01:30:47.340 align:start position:0%
distribution or is that going to be like
 
01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:48.050 align:start position:0%
distribution or is that going to be like
a

01:30:48.050 --> 01:30:48.060 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:30:49.729 --> 01:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
a licensing system as well for some
 
01:30:51.350 --> 01:30:51.360 align:start position:0%
distributes as well as growing and then
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
just the processing of the of the grown
 
01:30:55.250 --> 01:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
product no much like the New Hampshire
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
Wineries and distilleries are allowed to
 
01:31:00.050 --> 01:31:00.060 align:start position:0%
self-distribute in the state the
 
01:31:01.790 --> 01:31:01.800 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and The Growers would be
 
01:31:03.530 --> 01:31:03.540 align:start position:0%
allowed to self-distribute in the state
 
01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
and so who how would the have we do we
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
have a good framework yet of how we
 
01:31:10.669 --> 01:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
would decide how many Growers it can be
 
01:31:12.590 --> 01:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
or is it just anybody to try it
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
unlimited okay the toughest piece in in
 
01:31:18.770 --> 01:31:18.780 align:start position:0%
this industry is and the mistake a lot
 
01:31:20.990 --> 01:31:21.000 align:start position:0%
of states have made is they've looked at
 
01:31:23.330 --> 01:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
profit first and they've looked at
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
safety second and the other the other
 
01:31:30.169 --> 01:31:30.179 align:start position:0%
biggest piece is that they're in such a
 
01:31:31.729 --> 01:31:31.739 align:start position:0%
rush to make the money
 
01:31:33.790 --> 01:31:33.800 align:start position:0%
they don't have enough product to sell
 
01:31:36.410 --> 01:31:36.420 align:start position:0%
Vermont ran out of product in five days
 
01:31:38.570 --> 01:31:38.580 align:start position:0%
when they opened so one of the thing is
 
01:31:41.750 --> 01:31:41.760 align:start position:0%
to make sure that you have enough
 
01:31:44.450 --> 01:31:44.460 align:start position:0%
Growers to supply the need for whatever
 
01:31:47.090 --> 01:31:47.100 align:start position:0%
amount of stores you have in your first
 
01:31:49.610 --> 01:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
wave which I would imagine would be five
 
01:31:51.410 --> 01:31:51.420 align:start position:0%
or six
 
01:31:55.370 --> 01:31:55.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I mean the not just I I
 
01:31:56.750 --> 01:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to get into the number part
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the number part of it but we have to
 
01:32:01.129 --> 01:32:01.139 align:start position:0%
because the numbers are staggering the
 
01:32:03.770 --> 01:32:03.780 align:start position:0%
sales are staggering and let's let's
 
01:32:06.410 --> 01:32:06.420 align:start position:0%
look at Massachusetts just as a quick
 
01:32:10.070 --> 01:32:10.080 align:start position:0%
example in 2019 Massachusetts did 400
 
01:32:11.870 --> 01:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
million dollars in sales
 
01:32:15.410 --> 01:32:15.420 align:start position:0%
2020 did 702 million dollars in sales
 
01:32:18.709 --> 01:32:18.719 align:start position:0%
and in 2022 they're gonna they did a
 
01:32:20.649 --> 01:32:20.659 align:start position:0%
hundred they did
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
1.75 billion dollars in sales so that's
 
01:32:28.870 --> 01:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they charge a 6.5 percent
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
excise tax which in 2022 uh was 109
 
01:32:36.410 --> 01:32:36.420 align:start position:0%
million to the state and the 10 points
 
01:32:39.250 --> 01:32:39.260 align:start position:0%
five percent 10.7 percent
 
01:32:43.850 --> 01:32:43.860 align:start position:0%
X size which is 1.57 million to the
 
01:32:48.470 --> 01:32:48.480 align:start position:0%
state so 6.25 sales tax 109 million in
 
01:32:48.480 --> 01:32:49.870 align:start position:0%
state so 6.25 sales tax 109 million in
2022

01:32:49.870 --> 01:32:49.880 align:start position:0%
2022
 
01:32:53.709 --> 01:32:53.719 align:start position:0%
10.7 excise tax
 
01:32:57.649 --> 01:32:57.659 align:start position:0%
1.57 million to the state so uh I just
 
01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
I've been
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
to to Maine and I've been to uh to
 
01:33:05.350 --> 01:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
Vermont and I've been to Massachusetts
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
uh there's a staggering number of uh New
 
01:33:11.270 --> 01:33:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plates wherever you go so that
 
01:33:13.570 --> 01:33:13.580 align:start position:0%
from a revenue standpoint
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
but I I wanted to just bring those
 
01:33:20.090 --> 01:33:20.100 align:start position:0%
numbers to you because those are
 
01:33:24.050 --> 01:33:24.060 align:start position:0%
in my humble opinion staggering numbers
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
so I think that it's something that we
 
01:33:30.649 --> 01:33:30.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:32.990 --> 01:33:33.000 align:start position:0%
I I would make it make a suggestion that
 
01:33:36.169 --> 01:33:36.179 align:start position:0%
we can get your Rel The Regulators from
 
01:33:37.910 --> 01:33:37.920 align:start position:0%
these respective States and I know we
 
01:33:39.229 --> 01:33:39.239 align:start position:0%
talked about Quebec last time because I
 
01:33:40.610 --> 01:33:40.620 align:start position:0%
do a state-run model but it'd be great
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
to hear from them directly I think if we
 
01:33:43.910 --> 01:33:43.920 align:start position:0%
could schedule that on to Future
 
01:33:45.890 --> 01:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
meetings I don't have a problem with
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
that I'll be curious I like to confirm
 
01:33:49.790 --> 01:33:49.800 align:start position:0%
that some of those Regulators will be
 
01:33:52.370 --> 01:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
willing to come testify because you know
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
we're summoning competition with each
 
01:33:57.110 --> 01:33:57.120 align:start position:0%
other yeah yeah just to point that out
 
01:33:59.810 --> 01:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
is just to clarify when you said self
 
01:34:02.689 --> 01:34:02.699 align:start position:0%
self-distribute uh manufacturer
 
01:34:05.149 --> 01:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
cultivator could do that you were
 
01:34:07.610 --> 01:34:07.620 align:start position:0%
suggesting that if a cultivator can sell
 
01:34:11.750 --> 01:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
their own grow on site make their own to
 
01:34:13.729 --> 01:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
in a retail capacity per se but not
 
01:34:15.590 --> 01:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily operated free kind of like a
 
01:34:17.030 --> 01:34:17.040 align:start position:0%
winery right now sells their own product
 
01:34:18.649 --> 01:34:18.659 align:start position:0%
on site but
 
01:34:20.470 --> 01:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
no the
 
01:34:24.590 --> 01:34:24.600 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and The Growers will have
 
01:34:26.750 --> 01:34:26.760 align:start position:0%
the option to have a retail license if
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
they choose to have a retail license
 
01:34:31.310 --> 01:34:31.320 align:start position:0%
it's a separate license obviously it's a
 
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
separate fee but those products that
 
01:34:37.189 --> 01:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
they grow and manufacture what they can
 
01:34:39.770 --> 01:34:39.780 align:start position:0%
self-distribute to the the retailers the
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
franchisees just like you know LaBelle
 
01:34:45.110 --> 01:34:45.120 align:start position:0%
Winery sells at her at her different
 
01:34:47.689 --> 01:34:47.699 align:start position:0%
facilities but she also sells in the New
 
01:34:49.790 --> 01:34:49.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire liquor store she sells in the
 
01:34:52.250 --> 01:34:52.260 align:start position:0%
grocery stores convenience stores she's
 
01:34:54.250 --> 01:34:54.260 align:start position:0%
able to self-distribute her product
 
01:34:57.729 --> 01:34:57.739 align:start position:0%
throughout the state but I believe
 
01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
particularly has a retail component to
 
01:35:02.689 --> 01:35:02.699 align:start position:0%
it where it does so would would a
 
01:35:06.129 --> 01:35:06.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:09.229 --> 01:35:09.239 align:start position:0%
assuming the zoning allows for it yeah
 
01:35:12.649 --> 01:35:12.659 align:start position:0%
yes and my idea that yes they would but
 
01:35:14.390 --> 01:35:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's obviously the legislation that
 
01:35:15.950 --> 01:35:15.960 align:start position:0%
questions come up a lot so whatever
 
01:35:17.270 --> 01:35:17.280 align:start position:0%
direction we go without you need to be
 
01:35:19.010 --> 01:35:19.020 align:start position:0%
buried so they would not be agency
 
01:35:21.590 --> 01:35:21.600 align:start position:0%
stores per se but they that you can sell
 
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
your own product in your location give
 
01:35:26.930 --> 01:35:26.940 align:start position:0%
tours you love no tastings
 
01:35:29.450 --> 01:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
correct we do things but you need to be
 
01:35:31.430 --> 01:35:31.440 align:start position:0%
clear with that one direction or another
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
because you are a franchisee and perhaps
 
01:35:36.590 --> 01:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
if your store is next to or near a
 
01:35:38.390 --> 01:35:38.400 align:start position:0%
winery and then that that's a
 
01:35:39.649 --> 01:35:39.659 align:start position:0%
possibility that you understand what I'm
 
01:35:42.229 --> 01:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
saying is you it that's In fairness to
 
01:35:43.850 --> 01:35:43.860 align:start position:0%
that person that's invest apparently
 
01:35:45.590 --> 01:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
over a million dollars into their retail
 
01:35:47.810 --> 01:35:47.820 align:start position:0%
store right uh but they're near a
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
cultivation facility and then that
 
01:35:51.169 --> 01:35:51.179 align:start position:0%
cultivation you want to make sure that
 
01:35:53.750 --> 01:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
no one can start well I I think that we
 
01:35:55.570 --> 01:35:55.580 align:start position:0%
would not allow
 
01:35:59.689 --> 01:35:59.699 align:start position:0%
uh a franchisee to next to a facility
 
01:36:03.169 --> 01:36:03.179 align:start position:0%
that's a grower a cultivator a
 
01:36:05.810 --> 01:36:05.820 align:start position:0%
manufacturer and Retail so they would if
 
01:36:07.129 --> 01:36:07.139 align:start position:0%
that retail they're all separate
 
01:36:09.770 --> 01:36:09.780 align:start position:0%
licenses but if that grower and
 
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
manufacturer chooses to have a retail
 
01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:15.120 align:start position:0%
license at that location it's something
 
01:36:18.649 --> 01:36:18.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:20.330 --> 01:36:20.340 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:36:22.250 --> 01:36:22.260 align:start position:0%
um just going back to what you said
 
01:36:22.260 --> 01:36:23.570 align:start position:0%
um just going back to what you said
about

01:36:23.570 --> 01:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:36:26.330 --> 01:36:26.340 align:start position:0%
um obviously part of this effort is to
 
01:36:28.129 --> 01:36:28.139 align:start position:0%
capture some of the revenue that's gone
 
01:36:30.649 --> 01:36:30.659 align:start position:0%
into our I mean it's undeniable that
 
01:36:33.530 --> 01:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
part of our motivation here is to keep
 
01:36:35.810 --> 01:36:35.820 align:start position:0%
this Revenue part of this Revenue in the
 
01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:36.770 align:start position:0%
this Revenue part of this Revenue in the
state

01:36:36.770 --> 01:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:36:39.530 --> 01:36:39.540 align:start position:0%
and it sounds like a lot of Art and I
 
01:36:41.149 --> 01:36:41.159 align:start position:0%
don't know the proportion I don't think
 
01:36:43.010 --> 01:36:43.020 align:start position:0%
anyone knows the proportion but a lot of
 
01:36:44.330 --> 01:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
our revenue is going to Massachusetts
 
01:36:47.330 --> 01:36:47.340 align:start position:0%
and Maine and Maine do we have a
 
01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:48.900 align:start position:0%
proportion it's hard to know probably
 
01:36:52.010 --> 01:36:52.020 align:start position:0%
it's hard I would go to the Senator's uh
 
01:36:54.470 --> 01:36:54.480 align:start position:0%
comment that their their private
 
01:36:54.480 --> 01:36:56.050 align:start position:0%
comment that their their private
businesses

01:36:56.050 --> 01:36:56.060 align:start position:0%
businesses
 
01:36:58.550 --> 01:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
they're very tight-lipped even to get
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
the information off the internet Tina
 
01:37:02.689 --> 01:37:02.699 align:start position:0%
had a very difficult time there's a lot
 
01:37:04.610 --> 01:37:04.620 align:start position:0%
of information out there it's not a lot
 
01:37:06.470 --> 01:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
of Revenue information out there right
 
01:37:09.110 --> 01:37:09.120 align:start position:0%
so in terms of just thinking about this
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
idea of wanting to capture the revenue I
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
know a lot of
 
01:37:12.600 --> 01:37:13.610 align:start position:0%
know a lot of
um

01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:37:19.550 --> 01:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:21.709 --> 01:37:21.719 align:start position:0%
um I
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
know that a lot of places in
 
01:37:25.850 --> 01:37:25.860 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts allow online ordering I
 
01:37:28.729 --> 01:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
don't know how they manage that but um
 
01:37:30.290 --> 01:37:30.300 align:start position:0%
is that something you all have thought
 
01:37:32.030 --> 01:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
about for New Hampshire allowing that
 
01:37:34.550 --> 01:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
online ordering because I know you know
 
01:37:36.410 --> 01:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
people like that for the convenience and
 
01:37:38.450 --> 01:37:38.460 align:start position:0%
so that's that's one issue and then
 
01:37:40.790 --> 01:37:40.800 align:start position:0%
along with that is the sort of inventory
 
01:37:44.149 --> 01:37:44.159 align:start position:0%
system will the franchisees be required
 
01:37:46.729 --> 01:37:46.739 align:start position:0%
to have like a standard inventory system
 
01:37:49.129 --> 01:37:49.139 align:start position:0%
they're that they'll they will use a
 
01:37:51.410 --> 01:37:51.420 align:start position:0%
system that the Liquor Commission will
 
01:37:54.950 --> 01:37:54.960 align:start position:0%
use so every franchisee their point of
 
01:37:57.129 --> 01:37:57.139 align:start position:0%
sale system will be a standard system
 
01:37:59.870 --> 01:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
that the Liquor Commission chooses and
 
01:38:03.530 --> 01:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
and uses uh as far as online ordering
 
01:38:06.110 --> 01:38:06.120 align:start position:0%
and delivery uh as long as it's done
 
01:38:08.090 --> 01:38:08.100 align:start position:0%
through a licensed carrier which would
 
01:38:12.169 --> 01:38:12.179 align:start position:0%
be UPS or FedEx and or a W-2 employee
 
01:38:13.970 --> 01:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
yes they would be able to deliver the
 
01:38:17.330 --> 01:38:17.340 align:start position:0%
product much like I guess they do in
 
01:38:20.390 --> 01:38:20.400 align:start position:0%
other states I guess I was talking about
 
01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:21.110 align:start position:0%
other states I guess I was talking about
um

01:38:21.110 --> 01:38:21.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:22.970 --> 01:38:22.980 align:start position:0%
so I wasn't talking about like being at
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
scent places but like you order and then
 
01:38:27.830 --> 01:38:27.840 align:start position:0%
you walk into the store and you get it
 
01:38:29.810 --> 01:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing you can do that as
 
01:38:36.590 --> 01:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
yes I do thank you yes one quick
 
01:38:39.830 --> 01:38:39.840 align:start position:0%
question I know you're running we're
 
01:38:41.689 --> 01:38:41.699 align:start position:0%
running a little bit late here but
 
01:38:44.149 --> 01:38:44.159 align:start position:0%
um has there been any thought to uh the
 
01:38:46.490 --> 01:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
determination of the number of growing
 
01:38:48.410 --> 01:38:48.420 align:start position:0%
or cultivation licenses that would be
 
01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:50.030 align:start position:0%
or cultivation licenses that would be
required

01:38:50.030 --> 01:38:50.040 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:38:52.070 --> 01:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
um for the State of New Hampshire to
 
01:38:55.850 --> 01:38:55.860 align:start position:0%
meet its requirements well there's 48 in
 
01:38:57.290 --> 01:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
Maine at the moment
 
01:38:57.300 --> 01:38:58.850 align:start position:0%
Maine at the moment
so

01:38:58.850 --> 01:38:58.860 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
I I haven't we haven't thought that
 
01:39:05.090 --> 01:39:05.100 align:start position:0%
we have would put some sort of a cap on
 
01:39:06.830 --> 01:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
it I think it would be something that
 
01:39:09.890 --> 01:39:09.900 align:start position:0%
we'd have to look at especially if the
 
01:39:12.470 --> 01:39:12.480 align:start position:0%
demand outweighed the supply the
 
01:39:13.910 --> 01:39:13.920 align:start position:0%
certainly the worst thing that you can
 
01:39:16.490 --> 01:39:16.500 align:start position:0%
do in business is to have the locations
 
01:39:18.470 --> 01:39:18.480 align:start position:0%
open with no product so I think that
 
01:39:20.330 --> 01:39:20.340 align:start position:0%
would be something that would we would
 
01:39:23.209 --> 01:39:23.219 align:start position:0%
have to govern specifically just like we
 
01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
would cover the the retail outlets as
 
01:39:25.800 --> 01:39:26.629 align:start position:0%
would cover the the retail outlets as
well

01:39:26.629 --> 01:39:26.639 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:39:28.430 --> 01:39:28.440 align:start position:0%
so it'd be fair to say then though that
 
01:39:29.570 --> 01:39:29.580 align:start position:0%
there would be two sides of that
 
01:39:31.729 --> 01:39:31.739 align:start position:0%
equation meeting demand but yet ensuring
 
01:39:33.470 --> 01:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
that there isn't so much of an
 
01:39:34.970 --> 01:39:34.980 align:start position:0%
overabundance of Licensing of
 
01:39:36.830 --> 01:39:36.840 align:start position:0%
cultivation that it ends up looking like
 
01:39:39.770 --> 01:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
what we see now in Oklahoma and some
 
01:39:41.270 --> 01:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
other states where there's been such a
 
01:39:43.310 --> 01:39:43.320 align:start position:0%
proliferation that the state's been
 
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
overrun and that's not even legalized in
 
01:39:47.270 --> 01:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma would that be fair to say so it
 
01:39:50.350 --> 01:39:50.360 align:start position:0%
should be a cap based on what the
 
01:39:53.090 --> 01:39:53.100 align:start position:0%
projected requirement would be I I don't
 
01:39:54.950 --> 01:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
want to use the word cap Chief with all
 
01:39:56.930 --> 01:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
due respect I think it's something it's
 
01:39:58.669 --> 01:39:58.679 align:start position:0%
a business decision that needs to be
 
01:40:01.790 --> 01:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
looked at I think that the depending on
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
the demand of the product in in business
 
01:40:07.129 --> 01:40:07.139 align:start position:0%
it you can't put a cap on it's like
 
01:40:08.870 --> 01:40:08.880 align:start position:0%
telling Bacardi they can only make so
 
01:40:11.810 --> 01:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
many bottles that's it because but if
 
01:40:13.970 --> 01:40:13.980 align:start position:0%
the shelves are empty then there's no
 
01:40:16.810 --> 01:40:16.820 align:start position:0%
Revenue so the balance here is the
 
01:40:19.910 --> 01:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
Premier thing is the safety of the
 
01:40:22.850 --> 01:40:22.860 align:start position:0%
product the revenue and the cultivation
 
01:40:25.790 --> 01:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
have to go together so if we have the
 
01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
demand to have 28 cultivators and we
 
01:40:32.930 --> 01:40:32.940 align:start position:0%
only have three we've got a problem
 
01:40:34.790 --> 01:40:34.800 align:start position:0%
I'm aware of that it's been a long time
 
01:40:37.250 --> 01:40:37.260 align:start position:0%
since I took economics in college but uh
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
supply and demand but also um
 
01:40:43.610 --> 01:40:43.620 align:start position:0%
suggest if not there be a basis for
 
01:40:45.410 --> 01:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
ensuring that there's not so much
 
01:40:47.450 --> 01:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
cultivation that is over cultivation and
 
01:40:50.229 --> 01:40:50.239 align:start position:0%
that reduces the the excess demand
 
01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
excess Supply actually reduces the cost
 
01:40:57.050 --> 01:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
correct yeah thank you
 
01:40:59.270 --> 01:40:59.280 align:start position:0%
I think you think this chip just just a
 
01:41:02.090 --> 01:41:02.100 align:start position:0%
quick response to this term cap I think
 
01:41:04.790 --> 01:41:04.800 align:start position:0%
create the cap creates an official
 
01:41:06.950 --> 01:41:06.960 align:start position:0%
situation that becomes very dangerous in
 
01:41:09.649 --> 01:41:09.659 align:start position:0%
the entire process it creates a series
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
of inequities to begin with of capping
 
01:41:15.890 --> 01:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
capping is something that you have to be
 
01:41:20.149 --> 01:41:20.159 align:start position:0%
very careful uh in in looking at just
 
01:41:21.890 --> 01:41:21.900 align:start position:0%
wanted to make that comment
 
01:41:26.410 --> 01:41:26.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:29.930 --> 01:41:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator I just wanted to uh
 
01:41:31.490 --> 01:41:31.500 align:start position:0%
clarify what I just heard a few minutes
 
01:41:34.070 --> 01:41:34.080 align:start position:0%
ago um so we were talking about limiting
 
01:41:35.629 --> 01:41:35.639 align:start position:0%
the number of stores through this
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
proposal and so that we could kind of
 
01:41:39.649 --> 01:41:39.659 align:start position:0%
not become Massachusetts and have a
 
01:41:41.750 --> 01:41:41.760 align:start position:0%
store on every corner but what I I think
 
01:41:44.209 --> 01:41:44.219 align:start position:0%
what I just heard is that the
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
cultivators could then automatically
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
become retail locations no not
 
01:41:51.649 --> 01:41:51.659 align:start position:0%
automatically the cultivators can apply
 
01:41:54.290 --> 01:41:54.300 align:start position:0%
for a retail license so if we're trying
 
01:41:56.030 --> 01:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
to limit the number of stores and we
 
01:41:58.430 --> 01:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
have unlimited cultivators then we're
 
01:42:00.050 --> 01:42:00.060 align:start position:0%
not really limiting the number of stores
 
01:42:03.649 --> 01:42:03.659 align:start position:0%
no we have the we have the option to
 
01:42:06.590 --> 01:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
give those cultivators a retail license
 
01:42:08.810 --> 01:42:08.820 align:start position:0%
or not I'm sure some of them they won't
 
01:42:11.330 --> 01:42:11.340 align:start position:0%
want it and I'm sure some of them will
 
01:42:14.750 --> 01:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
so I think that as per as far as to the
 
01:42:16.910 --> 01:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
point of how many cultivators do we
 
01:42:16.920 --> 01:42:17.990 align:start position:0%
point of how many cultivators do we
allow

01:42:17.990 --> 01:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
allow
 
01:42:19.910 --> 01:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's a decision that needs to be made
 
01:42:22.729 --> 01:42:22.739 align:start position:0%
based on how much product we sell
 
01:42:24.590 --> 01:42:24.600 align:start position:0%
if we're constantly running out of
 
01:42:26.990 --> 01:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
product we need more cultivators now
 
01:42:28.370 --> 01:42:28.380 align:start position:0%
although every single one of those
 
01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:30.179 align:start position:0%
cultivators want a retail license
 
01:42:36.430 --> 01:42:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:38.270 --> 01:42:38.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so we've been talking a lot
 
01:42:40.850 --> 01:42:40.860 align:start position:0%
about money about my I can't calculate
 
01:42:43.850 --> 01:42:43.860 align:start position:0%
what 2.5 million dollars in sales equals
 
01:42:46.430 --> 01:42:46.440 align:start position:0%
in tonnage marijuana for growth is there
 
01:42:48.770 --> 01:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
a way of of calculating that out and
 
01:42:50.870 --> 01:42:50.880 align:start position:0%
figuring out what we think we might need
 
01:42:53.870 --> 01:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
for the number of Acres number of plants
 
01:42:55.609 --> 01:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
number of whatever we want to qualify it
 
01:42:57.649 --> 01:42:57.659 align:start position:0%
as to get to what we think that
 
01:42:59.330 --> 01:42:59.340 align:start position:0%
cultivation industry is going to look
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
like I think we'd have to rely on the
 
01:43:03.770 --> 01:43:03.780 align:start position:0%
consultant for those those types of uh
 
01:43:05.870 --> 01:43:05.880 align:start position:0%
metrics it's not something that the
 
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is privy to
 
01:43:11.990 --> 01:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
so again my understanding is in every
 
01:43:13.550 --> 01:43:13.560 align:start position:0%
state it's state regulated for the
 
01:43:16.570 --> 01:43:16.580 align:start position:0%
retail side so we know from seed to sale
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
what that product looks like at a state
 
01:43:20.810 --> 01:43:20.820 align:start position:0%
level so we should be able to base on
 
01:43:22.550 --> 01:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
our states do a simple calculation of
 
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
how much how much bud do they have in
 
01:43:28.070 --> 01:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
and and to create that Revenue so we can
 
01:43:30.590 --> 01:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
get an estimate of what that looks like
 
01:43:32.990 --> 01:43:33.000 align:start position:0%
I would say that's a safe assumption
 
01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.689 align:start position:0%
I would say that's a safe assumption
senator

01:43:35.689 --> 01:43:35.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:37.370 --> 01:43:37.380 align:start position:0%
which I guess I'd like that information
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
when you get it that's how much how much
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
material do we need to generate X number
 
01:43:43.189 --> 01:43:43.199 align:start position:0%
of dollars in Revenue because again
 
01:43:45.470 --> 01:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
other states have similar models we know
 
01:43:47.090 --> 01:43:47.100 align:start position:0%
what the sale looks like and what the
 
01:43:49.970 --> 01:43:49.980 align:start position:0%
how much product they need to sell to
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
create that so if we could find out that
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
number I'd appreciate that so I
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
understand what cultivation looks a
 
01:44:00.790 --> 01:44:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:03.649 --> 01:44:03.659 align:start position:0%
okay so unfortunately I have to leave
 
01:44:05.330 --> 01:44:05.340 align:start position:0%
it's noon
 
01:44:07.250 --> 01:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
um what I'm hearing here is we we're
 
01:44:09.169 --> 01:44:09.179 align:start position:0%
learning a lot of important things that
 
01:44:11.629 --> 01:44:11.639 align:start position:0%
we want to make sure are included in our
 
01:44:14.810 --> 01:44:14.820 align:start position:0%
discussion and so I was aware that we
 
01:44:16.609 --> 01:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
did the minutes we're talking let's go
 
01:44:19.129 --> 01:44:19.139 align:start position:0%
through a bill so what I would like to
 
01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:21.179 align:start position:0%
see is maybe is for all the committee
 
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
members and actually members of the
 
01:44:24.050 --> 01:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
audience and anybody who wants their way
 
01:44:28.250 --> 01:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
in is to go through 1598 look in there
 
01:44:30.109 --> 01:44:30.119 align:start position:0%
and see what things are there
 
01:44:32.390 --> 01:44:32.400 align:start position:0%
things that you don't like
 
01:44:34.910 --> 01:44:34.920 align:start position:0%
we like to have recommendations to fix
 
01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:35.689 align:start position:0%
we like to have recommendations to fix
it

01:44:35.689 --> 01:44:35.699 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:44:37.910 --> 01:44:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay so please put your thinking cap on
 
01:44:39.229 --> 01:44:39.239 align:start position:0%
and tell us how you think it should be
 
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
better or different use you can use the
 
01:44:43.970 --> 01:44:43.980 align:start position:0%
other Bill any bills any ideas you have
 
01:44:46.669 --> 01:44:46.679 align:start position:0%
anything that you see that there is in
 
01:44:48.709 --> 01:44:48.719 align:start position:0%
it or not in it you know let's write
 
01:44:50.330 --> 01:44:50.340 align:start position:0%
them all down and then put that together
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
and that way we can have a good plan
 
01:44:54.590 --> 01:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
going forward about how many special
 
01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:57.179 align:start position:0%
sessions we need on what sections but
 
01:44:58.970 --> 01:44:58.980 align:start position:0%
also to know what parts of the build
 
01:45:01.850 --> 01:45:01.860 align:start position:0%
that we're we're okay with as a working
 
01:45:03.890 --> 01:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
model and that's just a recommendation
 
01:45:07.310 --> 01:45:07.320 align:start position:0%
and just like the very first I want the
 
01:45:09.050 --> 01:45:09.060 align:start position:0%
first page well the definition section I
 
01:45:10.910 --> 01:45:10.920 align:start position:0%
know the definition of cannabis in and
 
01:45:13.390 --> 01:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
of itself as an issue so it's
 
01:45:15.709 --> 01:45:15.719 align:start position:0%
we'll cover that
 
01:45:17.450 --> 01:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
um but other than that I have to go
 
01:45:18.890 --> 01:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
there's anyone else in the committee
 
01:45:21.050 --> 01:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
have any any comment on that I mean
 
01:45:22.490 --> 01:45:22.500 align:start position:0%
obviously I was I was hoping to go
 
01:45:25.430 --> 01:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
through 1598 today and just to clarify
 
01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
to the people listening at home and
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
here in attendance it's 15 HP 1598 from
 
01:45:33.350 --> 01:45:33.360 align:start position:0%
last term but it's what passed as
 
01:45:35.450 --> 01:45:35.460 align:start position:0%
amended in the house there's a few
 
01:45:36.470 --> 01:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
different versions of that but
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
ultimately the one that made it out of
 
01:45:40.729 --> 01:45:40.739 align:start position:0%
the house and failed in the Senate that
 
01:45:43.310 --> 01:45:43.320 align:start position:0%
you want to get that version that's that
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:50.689 --> 01:45:50.699 align:start position:0%
customer using 59 user basis and looking
 
01:45:53.510 --> 01:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
ready modifications in the members of
 
01:45:54.830 --> 01:45:54.840 align:start position:0%
the commission should have a side by
 
01:45:58.390 --> 01:45:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:01.790 --> 01:46:01.800 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 98 that has has a
 
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:10.250 --> 01:46:10.260 align:start position:0%
I have it was distributed last time I
 
01:46:12.410 --> 01:46:12.420 align:start position:0%
believe but I I'll make sure I'll make
 
01:46:13.970 --> 01:46:13.980 align:start position:0%
sure you get a copy
 
01:46:16.010 --> 01:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
I know representation you have to leave
 
01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
but is there any
 
01:46:19.790 --> 01:46:19.800 align:start position:0%
uh is there any point of us maybe
 
01:46:21.229 --> 01:46:21.239 align:start position:0%
perhaps going through the definition
 
01:46:23.510 --> 01:46:23.520 align:start position:0%
section starting going through 590 is a
 
01:46:25.669 --> 01:46:25.679 align:start position:0%
long bill how about set the date for the
 
01:46:27.229 --> 01:46:27.239 align:start position:0%
next meeting
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
right we can do that Chief right
 
01:46:33.530 --> 01:46:33.540 align:start position:0%
um I I just wonder whether or not it's
 
01:46:35.209 --> 01:46:35.219 align:start position:0%
appropriate to go through 1598 before
 
01:46:36.830 --> 01:46:36.840 align:start position:0%
we've heard from some of the focus
 
01:46:38.270 --> 01:46:38.280 align:start position:0%
groups regarding some of the other
 
01:46:41.030 --> 01:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
Salient issues that are in 1598 that we
 
01:46:42.470 --> 01:46:42.480 align:start position:0%
haven't heard and haven't flushed out
 
01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:43.850 align:start position:0%
haven't heard and haven't flushed out
yet

01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:46:46.490 --> 01:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
I think what we want to do is as we're
 
01:46:49.070 --> 01:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
going through 1598 you know obviously we
 
01:46:51.470 --> 01:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
would welcome some comments from anyone
 
01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:52.490 align:start position:0%
would welcome some comments from anyone
that's

01:46:52.490 --> 01:46:52.500 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:46:55.550 --> 01:46:55.560 align:start position:0%
that perhaps if we kind of run into some
 
01:46:58.129 --> 01:46:58.139 align:start position:0%
application issues on how it would apply
 
01:46:59.750 --> 01:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
uh we're still going to have those
 
01:47:01.370 --> 01:47:01.380 align:start position:0%
hearings with the public can kind of
 
01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:02.820 align:start position:0%
address some of those concerns we run
 
01:47:05.629 --> 01:47:05.639 align:start position:0%
into nothing set in stone but
 
01:47:07.729 --> 01:47:07.739 align:start position:0%
uh putting forward a model that would
 
01:47:09.830 --> 01:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
actually work what it what is inside
 
01:47:11.570 --> 01:47:11.580 align:start position:0%
that that doesn't work that we already
 
01:47:14.030 --> 01:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
know and I'm sure the people that are
 
01:47:16.490 --> 01:47:16.500 align:start position:0%
listening now are probably gearing up
 
01:47:19.370 --> 01:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
but that's just my people has any
 
01:47:23.030 --> 01:47:23.040 align:start position:0%
comment on that
 
01:47:26.450 --> 01:47:26.460 align:start position:0%
um Mr chair just to follow up Chief
 
01:47:28.490 --> 01:47:28.500 align:start position:0%
um I'm wondering what the thinking is
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
and what the rationale is to look at
 
01:47:33.410 --> 01:47:33.420 align:start position:0%
legislation that failed
 
01:47:35.870 --> 01:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
and have that inform our next steps
 
01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
rather than listening to a stakeholder
 
01:47:40.790 --> 01:47:40.800 align:start position:0%
and subject matter experts from the
 
01:47:44.890 --> 01:47:44.900 align:start position:0%
other states let them inform uh our
 
01:47:49.189 --> 01:47:49.199 align:start position:0%
input into 1598 after the fact it seems
 
01:47:50.450 --> 01:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
like we're kind of putting the cut
 
01:47:52.189 --> 01:47:52.199 align:start position:0%
before the horse
 
01:47:54.470 --> 01:47:54.480 align:start position:0%
yeah it just may come at 1598 never was
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
voted on
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
the amendment you see in front of you
 
01:48:00.770 --> 01:48:00.780 align:start position:0%
this 1598 Amendment okay what this
 
01:48:03.229 --> 01:48:03.239 align:start position:0%
amendment was was original Bill the
 
01:48:05.570 --> 01:48:05.580 align:start position:0%
original as it was submitted house was
 
01:48:07.669 --> 01:48:07.679 align:start position:0%
not a franchise bill
 
01:48:12.350 --> 01:48:12.360 align:start position:0%
it was a a direct retail okay so this
 
01:48:16.550 --> 01:48:16.560 align:start position:0%
amendment was drawn up to take what was
 
01:48:18.950 --> 01:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
passed by the house overwhelmingly
 
01:48:20.990 --> 01:48:21.000 align:start position:0%
but to fix it so that it would be a
 
01:48:23.390 --> 01:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
franchise bill so it really is a very
 
01:48:25.370 --> 01:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
new piece of legislation that's never
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
been seen by anybody
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
and by any any uh you know the committee
 
01:48:31.850 --> 01:48:31.860 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee decided not to
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
vote for it because they didn't have
 
01:48:35.990 --> 01:48:36.000 align:start position:0%
time to go through it right uh thank you
 
01:48:39.229 --> 01:48:39.239 align:start position:0%
representative one one further question
 
01:48:41.330 --> 01:48:41.340 align:start position:0%
um if we're bringing in um subject
 
01:48:43.550 --> 01:48:43.560 align:start position:0%
matter experts from Canada and other
 
01:48:46.550 --> 01:48:46.560 align:start position:0%
states that have implemented models
 
01:48:48.950 --> 01:48:48.960 align:start position:0%
isn't it you know
 
01:48:53.030 --> 01:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
a wise use of time to wait and and then
 
01:48:55.669 --> 01:48:55.679 align:start position:0%
examine this and build upon it so I was
 
01:48:58.790 --> 01:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
uh well I agree with you so and maybe I
 
01:49:00.890 --> 01:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
wasn't you know specifically declare
 
01:49:03.649 --> 01:49:03.659 align:start position:0%
what I was saying and that is that I was
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
hoping people would go through all the
 
01:49:08.030 --> 01:49:08.040 align:start position:0%
bills find the things that you like and
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
you don't like make a list of it then
 
01:49:14.030 --> 01:49:14.040 align:start position:0%
when we do our next meeting we can go
 
01:49:15.890 --> 01:49:15.900 align:start position:0%
through and schedule and figure out what
 
01:49:18.470 --> 01:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
needs to be heard who we can hear from
 
01:49:21.830 --> 01:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
and figure that out then after we've
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
gotten that advice and after we've
 
01:49:25.790 --> 01:49:25.800 align:start position:0%
gotten pieces that we all can agree on
 
01:49:27.709 --> 01:49:27.719 align:start position:0%
like if whatever was enforcement
 
01:49:30.770 --> 01:49:30.780 align:start position:0%
penalties or whatever decision that we
 
01:49:33.169 --> 01:49:33.179 align:start position:0%
decide we'd like then we go through the
 
01:49:36.109 --> 01:49:36.119 align:start position:0%
bill and and and put it into the
 
01:49:38.209 --> 01:49:38.219 align:start position:0%
legislation I think the point
 
01:49:41.330 --> 01:49:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative Hunt's making is 1598 the
 
01:49:43.490 --> 01:49:43.500 align:start position:0%
retail the definition of a retail store
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
was a state-run store and right off the
 
01:49:48.530 --> 01:49:48.540 align:start position:0%
bat that won't work I think kind of the
 
01:49:50.750 --> 01:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
goal would be even maybe merge that
 
01:49:53.030 --> 01:49:53.040 align:start position:0%
language merge the franchise language
 
01:49:55.189 --> 01:49:55.199 align:start position:0%
into this this bill and at that point in
 
01:49:57.890 --> 01:49:57.900 align:start position:0%
time we then go through it again a
 
01:49:59.209 --> 01:49:59.219 align:start position:0%
second time where we're going to have
 
01:50:00.850 --> 01:50:00.860 align:start position:0%
the public comment on
 
01:50:03.590 --> 01:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
subsections of that bill because and
 
01:50:04.790 --> 01:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
we're kind of just using that as a
 
01:50:07.250 --> 01:50:07.260 align:start position:0%
template to start discussion I don't to
 
01:50:08.870 --> 01:50:08.880 align:start position:0%
get it off this is going to be a
 
01:50:11.689 --> 01:50:11.699 align:start position:0%
comprehensive piece of legislation if
 
01:50:14.450 --> 01:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
one were to go forward so so we're not
 
01:50:17.030 --> 01:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
actually it feels like we're writing
 
01:50:20.390 --> 01:50:20.400 align:start position:0%
legislation rather than given a report
 
01:50:22.669 --> 01:50:22.679 align:start position:0%
that that's that's my major concern that
 
01:50:25.149 --> 01:50:25.159 align:start position:0%
is the goal of this commission
 
01:50:27.470 --> 01:50:27.480 align:start position:0%
the charge of the commission is to put
 
01:50:30.350 --> 01:50:30.360 align:start position:0%
together legislation which does not mean
 
01:50:33.290 --> 01:50:33.300 align:start position:0%
someone supports the legislation I would
 
01:50:34.850 --> 01:50:34.860 align:start position:0%
emphasize putting something together
 
01:50:36.530 --> 01:50:36.540 align:start position:0%
we've got to make sure that this could
 
01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
actually operate in reality I I my
 
01:50:41.450 --> 01:50:41.460 align:start position:0%
weight is that it's proposing
 
01:50:43.550 --> 01:50:43.560 align:start position:0%
legislation not necessarily writing
 
01:50:46.910 --> 01:50:46.920 align:start position:0%
legislation they're two two separate
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
two different things I just want to
 
01:50:48.719 --> 01:50:49.990 align:start position:0%
two different things I just want to
clarify

01:50:49.990 --> 01:50:50.000 align:start position:0%
clarify
 
01:50:53.209 --> 01:50:53.219 align:start position:0%
so I just just to clarify I'm looking at
 
01:50:55.430 --> 01:50:55.440 align:start position:0%
the actual statute
 
01:50:58.070 --> 01:50:58.080 align:start position:0%
and it says the commission we're
 
01:51:00.290 --> 01:51:00.300 align:start position:0%
establishing a commission to study with
 
01:51:01.850 --> 01:51:01.860 align:start position:0%
the purpose of proposing legislation
 
01:51:04.070 --> 01:51:04.080 align:start position:0%
State controlled sales and then if you
 
01:51:06.229 --> 01:51:06.239 align:start position:0%
look at what we shall do the commission
 
01:51:07.910 --> 01:51:07.920 align:start position:0%
shall study with the purpose of
 
01:51:10.609 --> 01:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
proposing legislation so is your point
 
01:51:11.930 --> 01:51:11.940 align:start position:0%
that we're sort of putting the cart
 
01:51:13.370 --> 01:51:13.380 align:start position:0%
before the horse we need to do more
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
study before we focus on yes
 
01:51:18.890 --> 01:51:18.900 align:start position:0%
so a middle ground is let's do some more
 
01:51:20.570 --> 01:51:20.580 align:start position:0%
study before we're actually getting to
 
01:51:22.430 --> 01:51:22.440 align:start position:0%
the nuts and bolts of the legislation I
 
01:51:24.649 --> 01:51:24.659 align:start position:0%
think what we do is we have a base model
 
01:51:26.390 --> 01:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
you study
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
and then because whatever whatever com
 
01:51:30.109 --> 01:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
whatever we kind of come up with I'm
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
fairly confident will not be the final
 
01:51:35.330 --> 01:51:35.340 align:start position:0%
product because we could just sit down
 
01:51:39.050 --> 01:51:39.060 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and craft legislation uh
 
01:51:41.270 --> 01:51:41.280 align:start position:0%
without hearing any input but that's
 
01:51:43.490 --> 01:51:43.500 align:start position:0%
that's not the purpose of a study
 
01:51:45.530 --> 01:51:45.540 align:start position:0%
commission right well when I was
 
01:51:47.870 --> 01:51:47.880 align:start position:0%
envisioning correct if I'm wrong here is
 
01:51:50.870 --> 01:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
once you have some baseline of what the
 
01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
proposed legislation could be then you
 
01:51:56.030 --> 01:51:56.040 align:start position:0%
hear comments on what that is but right
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
now anything that they comment on I
 
01:52:01.370 --> 01:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
don't and representative correct if I'm
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
wrong I know 1598 doesn't have anything
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
about franchise agreements in there and
 
01:52:06.770 --> 01:52:06.780 align:start position:0%
obviously the canvas definition do they
 
01:52:09.229 --> 01:52:09.239 align:start position:0%
call them an agency store but yeah
 
01:52:11.510 --> 01:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
the the key element is what I was
 
01:52:13.970 --> 01:52:13.980 align:start position:0%
looking for when I say that was I want
 
01:52:16.010 --> 01:52:16.020 align:start position:0%
whatever issues that you really care
 
01:52:16.020 --> 01:52:17.270 align:start position:0%
whatever issues that you really care
about

01:52:17.270 --> 01:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:52:19.970 --> 01:52:19.980 align:start position:0%
I want you to make sure you've let us
 
01:52:21.649 --> 01:52:21.659 align:start position:0%
all know ahead of time let us know what
 
01:52:23.750 --> 01:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
they are and if you have suggested
 
01:52:26.570 --> 01:52:26.580 align:start position:0%
language that you would like to see in
 
01:52:28.729 --> 01:52:28.739 align:start position:0%
Lane in the bill to address the issue
 
01:52:30.350 --> 01:52:30.360 align:start position:0%
you care about
 
01:52:32.689 --> 01:52:32.699 align:start position:0%
tell us sooner rather than later and
 
01:52:33.890 --> 01:52:33.900 align:start position:0%
that's the same thing for the chief
 
01:52:37.490 --> 01:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
saying for ACLU everyone has got their
 
01:52:38.870 --> 01:52:38.880 align:start position:0%
things that they're really important to
 
01:52:41.450 --> 01:52:41.460 align:start position:0%
them and I think that that when and I've
 
01:52:43.070 --> 01:52:43.080 align:start position:0%
been doing this for a while that when we
 
01:52:45.890 --> 01:52:45.900 align:start position:0%
when I put a bill together I I need the
 
01:52:49.310 --> 01:52:49.320 align:start position:0%
pieces and then when we start building
 
01:52:51.890 --> 01:52:51.900 align:start position:0%
it is all those blocks are there and I
 
01:52:53.510 --> 01:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
can then we can then insert them and
 
01:52:55.430 --> 01:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
make sure they're in the right place and
 
01:52:57.169 --> 01:52:57.179 align:start position:0%
it makes sense rather than someone come
 
01:52:59.209 --> 01:52:59.219 align:start position:0%
along afterwards and say oh but I want
 
01:53:01.250 --> 01:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
to consider this and wait a second you
 
01:53:03.109 --> 01:53:03.119 align:start position:0%
know please tell us up front what you're
 
01:53:05.930 --> 01:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
interested so I'm I'm also thinking in
 
01:53:07.850 --> 01:53:07.860 align:start position:0%
terms of what's in here now maybe
 
01:53:10.970 --> 01:53:10.980 align:start position:0%
already address what you want but if it
 
01:53:13.850 --> 01:53:13.860 align:start position:0%
doesn't tell us sooner rather than later
 
01:53:16.250 --> 01:53:16.260 align:start position:0%
that's what I was looking for yeah Mr
 
01:53:19.729 --> 01:53:19.739 align:start position:0%
chair I think um the point uh here is
 
01:53:22.669 --> 01:53:22.679 align:start position:0%
that using today's example there was
 
01:53:22.679 --> 01:53:23.750 align:start position:0%
that using today's example there was
um

01:53:23.750 --> 01:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:53:27.290 --> 01:53:27.300 align:start position:0%
um a lot of information that um thanks
 
01:53:28.910 --> 01:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
to Liquor Commission folks brought
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
forward today that would in um that
 
01:53:35.629 --> 01:53:35.639 align:start position:0%
would be used uh to review that section
 
01:53:39.709 --> 01:53:39.719 align:start position:0%
of 1598 as opposed to how regulation
 
01:53:41.330 --> 01:53:41.340 align:start position:0%
should look like and I think the point
 
01:53:44.629 --> 01:53:44.639 align:start position:0%
is that to be able to credibly look at
 
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
other pieces of that legislation there
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps may be a need for some
 
01:53:51.169 --> 01:53:51.179 align:start position:0%
additional study in certain areas before
 
01:53:53.930 --> 01:53:53.940 align:start position:0%
we start because clearly there were a
 
01:53:55.310 --> 01:53:55.320 align:start position:0%
lot there was a lot of information that
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
was brought forward today that disposed
 
01:53:59.689 --> 01:53:59.699 align:start position:0%
of some questions and probably created
 
01:54:01.669 --> 01:54:01.679 align:start position:0%
some question which I think is helpful
 
01:54:04.490 --> 01:54:04.500 align:start position:0%
when when you look at so in terms of
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
efficiency perhaps that's a more
 
01:54:08.810 --> 01:54:08.820 align:start position:0%
efficient way of doing it rather than
 
01:54:10.609 --> 01:54:10.619 align:start position:0%
going through it and then having to
 
01:54:12.050 --> 01:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
Circle back once we've heard from
 
01:54:14.149 --> 01:54:14.159 align:start position:0%
somebody else well we we didn't think
 
01:54:16.970 --> 01:54:16.980 align:start position:0%
about that particular element
 
01:54:19.850 --> 01:54:19.860 align:start position:0%
any any other comment
 
01:54:22.609 --> 01:54:22.619 align:start position:0%
rips and kale yeah
 
01:54:24.709 --> 01:54:24.719 align:start position:0%
are we do you think we should be hearing
 
01:54:27.410 --> 01:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
some from some federal agencies to come
 
01:54:28.490 --> 01:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
in and talk to us about the
 
01:54:30.109 --> 01:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
transportation factor of this I mean
 
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
like what happens when we sell to a
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
Canadian Citizen and they try and cross
 
01:54:36.950 --> 01:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
the border you know I mean like are we
 
01:54:39.229 --> 01:54:39.239 align:start position:0%
going to rough follow some stuff there
 
01:54:41.629 --> 01:54:41.639 align:start position:0%
um you know uh it's great that we're
 
01:54:43.250 --> 01:54:43.260 align:start position:0%
talking about franchises like McDonald's
 
01:54:44.990 --> 01:54:45.000 align:start position:0%
and all these places but those are all
 
01:54:46.850 --> 01:54:46.860 align:start position:0%
legal items
 
01:54:49.310 --> 01:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
like those like selling alcohol and
 
01:54:51.109 --> 01:54:51.119 align:start position:0%
transferring alcohol across state lines
 
01:54:52.669 --> 01:54:52.679 align:start position:0%
or I don't know about transferring
 
01:54:55.970 --> 01:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
alcohol across International lines but
 
01:54:57.890 --> 01:54:57.900 align:start position:0%
um those are all legal items right we're
 
01:55:00.050 --> 01:55:00.060 align:start position:0%
talking about creating a franchise to
 
01:55:01.850 --> 01:55:01.860 align:start position:0%
sell an illegal item and then transfer
 
01:55:03.770 --> 01:55:03.780 align:start position:0%
it across possibly state lines with our
 
01:55:05.090 --> 01:55:05.100 align:start position:0%
customers right
 
01:55:07.729 --> 01:55:07.739 align:start position:0%
and international ones I think in
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
respect to that issue I'm not against
 
01:55:11.629 --> 01:55:11.639 align:start position:0%
any any from the feds federal government
 
01:55:13.850 --> 01:55:13.860 align:start position:0%
which is to offer their input I'm sure
 
01:55:16.850 --> 01:55:16.860 align:start position:0%
who would welcome it but right now the
 
01:55:18.590 --> 01:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
state law I don't know about Maine's but
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
I know when Massachusetts first had
 
01:55:23.209 --> 01:55:23.219 align:start position:0%
retail they were only allowed to sell it
 
01:55:25.729 --> 01:55:25.739 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts residents and as we
 
01:55:25.739 --> 01:55:26.570 align:start position:0%
to Massachusetts residents and as we
heard

01:55:26.570 --> 01:55:26.580 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:55:28.250 --> 01:55:28.260 align:start position:0%
the amount of
 
01:55:28.260 --> 01:55:30.470 align:start position:0%
the amount of
cars

01:55:30.470 --> 01:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
cars
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
that were in the plate now that's
 
01:55:34.970 --> 01:55:34.980 align:start position:0%
incorrect someone please tell me I'm not
 
01:55:37.310 --> 01:55:37.320 align:start position:0%
is that not accurate oh that was not
 
01:55:40.430 --> 01:55:40.440 align:start position:0%
true that's not true okay well so
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's no restriction on who
 
01:55:42.890 --> 01:55:42.900 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Institute there's no
 
01:55:44.930 --> 01:55:44.940 align:start position:0%
restriction on who main sells it to
 
01:55:47.390 --> 01:55:47.400 align:start position:0%
yeah the only requirement is that before
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
you get into the facility you have to
 
01:55:52.250 --> 01:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
show your driver's license and and then
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
and make sure you're 21. but they do not
 
01:55:56.689 --> 01:55:56.699 align:start position:0%
look at what state your license was
 
01:55:59.090 --> 01:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
issued in they they don't they don't
 
01:56:00.109 --> 01:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
seem to care
 
01:56:04.070 --> 01:56:04.080 align:start position:0%
all right well in that case but I also
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
say yes I just so you all know that the
 
01:56:08.090 --> 01:56:08.100 align:start position:0%
Biden Administration is really apt to
 
01:56:11.270 --> 01:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
make sure that that it's moved from
 
01:56:13.790 --> 01:56:13.800 align:start position:0%
schedule one to schedule three within
 
01:56:14.930 --> 01:56:14.940 align:start position:0%
the next year
 
01:56:16.490 --> 01:56:16.500 align:start position:0%
so I would say by the time this
 
01:56:18.290 --> 01:56:18.300 align:start position:0%
commission is done we will probably have
 
01:56:20.270 --> 01:56:20.280 align:start position:0%
already that that scheduling have
 
01:56:21.830 --> 01:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
already been reduced perhaps we've just
 
01:56:24.350 --> 01:56:24.360 align:start position:0%
taken into consideration maybe if you
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
have a US government issued IDs that I
 
01:56:28.129 --> 01:56:28.139 align:start position:0%
think he's interested in running winning
 
01:56:29.810 --> 01:56:29.820 align:start position:0%
reelection and he thinks that this is an
 
01:56:32.689 --> 01:56:32.699 align:start position:0%
election issue to get marijuana legal Mr
 
01:56:34.189 --> 01:56:34.199 align:start position:0%
chair if I can step away from the
 
01:56:34.199 --> 01:56:35.930 align:start position:0%
chair if I can step away from the
politics

01:56:35.930 --> 01:56:35.940 align:start position:0%
politics
 
01:56:39.109 --> 01:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
um down that rabbit hole pretty fast
 
01:56:40.790 --> 01:56:40.800 align:start position:0%
um so for next meeting
 
01:56:42.350 --> 01:56:42.360 align:start position:0%
um I think there was a request to have
 
01:56:45.169 --> 01:56:45.179 align:start position:0%
DHHS here with medical cannabis
 
01:56:46.430 --> 01:56:46.440 align:start position:0%
licensing to make sure there's no
 
01:56:48.590 --> 01:56:48.600 align:start position:0%
conflict between medical cannabis and
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
what would a retail relation looks like
 
01:56:51.709 --> 01:56:51.719 align:start position:0%
because I know under medical they have
 
01:56:53.750 --> 01:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
to have a not-for-profit status and how
 
01:56:55.669 --> 01:56:55.679 align:start position:0%
does that play into having a retail
 
01:56:57.470 --> 01:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
location so we probably need to have
 
01:56:59.810 --> 01:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
that conversation we have the AG come in
 
01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
to talk about the legal liability of the
 
01:57:03.050 --> 01:57:03.060 align:start position:0%
state and what we think that looks like
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
and maybe a part of that Transportation
 
01:57:07.010 --> 01:57:07.020 align:start position:0%
conversation can happen there and then
 
01:57:08.689 --> 01:57:08.699 align:start position:0%
the last piece of the day was going to
 
01:57:10.850 --> 01:57:10.860 align:start position:0%
be talking about 1598 and pieces people
 
01:57:13.189 --> 01:57:13.199 align:start position:0%
may want to add in or expand out or have
 
01:57:14.810 --> 01:57:14.820 align:start position:0%
a conversation about what that would
 
01:57:17.270 --> 01:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
look like so the question is how long do
 
01:57:19.010 --> 01:57:19.020 align:start position:0%
you think it's going to take us to go
 
01:57:22.669 --> 01:57:22.679 align:start position:0%
through 5098 and all the problems it has
 
01:57:24.050 --> 01:57:24.060 align:start position:0%
or had
 
01:57:28.970 --> 01:57:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
well my question is by having covering
 
01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
well there might be some low-hanging
 
01:57:36.109 --> 01:57:36.119 align:start position:0%
fruit we can see right away Senator
 
01:57:38.330 --> 01:57:38.340 align:start position:0%
covering three topics you know whether
 
01:57:40.310 --> 01:57:40.320 align:start position:0%
it's about DHHS Transportation the
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
Attorney General on top of going through
 
01:57:45.290 --> 01:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
1598 kind of to see where it's at where
 
01:57:46.790 --> 01:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
we have the problems with it
 
01:57:50.030 --> 01:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
from a time scale I mean
 
01:57:52.250 --> 01:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
support I I I can handle a four hour
 
01:57:53.570 --> 01:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
meeting I can handle a six-hour meeting
 
01:57:55.609 --> 01:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
I'm speaking for myself I need the rest
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
of you to be able to
 
01:58:00.010 --> 01:58:00.020 align:start position:0%
tell me you can handle that as well
 
01:58:04.250 --> 01:58:04.260 align:start position:0%
yes I would request that we just to
 
01:58:06.290 --> 01:58:06.300 align:start position:0%
respect all the committee members I
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
think we should separate this continued
 
01:58:11.629 --> 01:58:11.639 align:start position:0%
sort of study from the really starting
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
to get into the bill that said I hear
 
01:58:16.669 --> 01:58:16.679 align:start position:0%
representative hunt saying it's a good
 
01:58:18.830 --> 01:58:18.840 align:start position:0%
idea to look at that all the members
 
01:58:20.209 --> 01:58:20.219 align:start position:0%
should look at it and see if there's
 
01:58:22.310 --> 01:58:22.320 align:start position:0%
areas we need to expand upon but I don't
 
01:58:24.770 --> 01:58:24.780 align:start position:0%
think we should go line by line until we
 
01:58:27.649 --> 01:58:27.659 align:start position:0%
have had a fair number of study meetings
 
01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:29.119 align:start position:0%
Best of Both Worlds
 
01:58:31.189 --> 01:58:31.199 align:start position:0%
all right so I think what we'll do
 
01:58:33.589 --> 01:58:33.599 align:start position:0%
suddenly just repeat the agenda see you
 
01:58:36.169 --> 01:58:36.179 align:start position:0%
again welcome job DH suggests to bring
 
01:58:37.609 --> 01:58:37.619 align:start position:0%
uh whoever's in charge of medical
 
01:58:39.649 --> 01:58:39.659 align:start position:0%
cannabis licensing product to talk about
 
01:58:41.930 --> 01:58:41.940 align:start position:0%
a franchise model and how to integrate
 
01:58:43.370 --> 01:58:43.380 align:start position:0%
with that medical model if we allow
 
01:58:45.890 --> 01:58:45.900 align:start position:0%
thc's to do it the second piece to have
 
01:58:47.450 --> 01:58:47.460 align:start position:0%
the Attorney General to come in and just
 
01:58:48.770 --> 01:58:48.780 align:start position:0%
do a legal liability for the state
 
01:58:48.780 --> 01:58:50.570 align:start position:0%
do a legal liability for the state
conversation

01:58:50.570 --> 01:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
01:58:52.609 --> 01:58:52.619 align:start position:0%
and then the members of the members of
 
01:58:54.350 --> 01:58:54.360 align:start position:0%
the commission we will all be looking at
 
01:58:57.050 --> 01:58:57.060 align:start position:0%
obviously we'll have a chance to review
 
01:58:59.450 --> 01:58:59.460 align:start position:0%
1598 as amended if anyone doesn't have a
 
01:59:01.010 --> 01:59:01.020 align:start position:0%
copy of that we can provide to you and
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
maybe point out some glaring problems
 
01:59:04.910 --> 01:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
with that bill
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
that we could perhaps use that for
 
01:59:08.810 --> 01:59:08.820 align:start position:0%
future agendas did you miss with your
 
01:59:10.850 --> 01:59:10.860 align:start position:0%
show 1598 was just doing that he's been
 
01:59:12.109 --> 01:59:12.119 align:start position:0%
talking about high points where we need
 
01:59:13.790 --> 01:59:13.800 align:start position:0%
deeper study where we have conflict of
 
01:59:15.109 --> 01:59:15.119 align:start position:0%
language that kind of thing and I
 
01:59:16.790 --> 01:59:16.800 align:start position:0%
believe the transportation should be
 
01:59:18.350 --> 01:59:18.360 align:start position:0%
maybe they have the Attorney General
 
01:59:21.169 --> 01:59:21.179 align:start position:0%
General comment on that yep under the
 
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
state legal I vote all right so when
 
01:59:25.370 --> 01:59:25.380 align:start position:0%
when is the next date that everyone's
 
01:59:25.380 --> 01:59:26.870 align:start position:0%
when is the next date that everyone's
available

01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
available
 
01:59:40.750 --> 01:59:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.550 --> 01:59:43.560 align:start position:0%
I'm not available on the second until 11
 
01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:48.129 align:start position:0%
I'm not available on the second until 11
30.

01:59:48.129 --> 01:59:48.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:50.810 --> 01:59:50.820 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
on the on the third I could do 11
 
02:00:00.050 --> 02:00:00.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.729 --> 02:00:04.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:07.430 --> 02:00:07.440 align:start position:0%
Tuesday afternoon for me but
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
can't do Tuesday afternoon Tuesday
 
02:00:11.689 --> 02:00:11.699 align:start position:0%
afternoon I have a meeting with the
 
02:00:13.089 --> 02:00:13.099 align:start position:0%
governor in the morning
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
we don't even hear everyone's schedules
 
02:00:16.430 --> 02:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
you can just say you're unavailable I'm
 
02:00:18.709 --> 02:00:18.719 align:start position:0%
unavailable Monday afternoon okay so
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
Monday afternoon on October 2nd doesn't
 
02:00:22.669 --> 02:00:22.679 align:start position:0%
work correct
 
02:00:26.810 --> 02:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
so the third afternoon does work though
 
02:00:29.450 --> 02:00:29.460 align:start position:0%

is that permitted
 
02:00:43.010 --> 02:00:43.020 align:start position:0%

meeting on the fourth so
 
02:00:53.450 --> 02:00:53.460 align:start position:0%

02:00:58.850 --> 02:00:58.860 align:start position:0%

02:02:49.970 --> 02:02:49.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just have a question about on
 
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
on the fifth
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
um would we be able to look at the
 
02:02:56.870 --> 02:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
proposed schedule in advance for
 
02:02:59.450 --> 02:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
bringing in uh some of the um
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that will be speaking to
 
02:03:03.490 --> 02:03:03.500 align:start position:0%
the subtopics
 
02:03:05.450 --> 02:03:05.460 align:start position:0%
I would just say this if there's any
 
02:03:07.729 --> 02:03:07.739 align:start position:0%
stakeholders that have availability
 
02:03:10.010 --> 02:03:10.020 align:start position:0%
issues perhaps just communicate that to
 
02:03:11.750 --> 02:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
the commission on what dates are
 
02:03:12.830 --> 02:03:12.840 align:start position:0%
convenient because obviously we value
 
02:03:14.930 --> 02:03:14.940 align:start position:0%
their opinion uh we have to obviously
 
02:03:17.149 --> 02:03:17.159 align:start position:0%
accommodate everyone's schedule here but
 
02:03:19.609 --> 02:03:19.619 align:start position:0%
if it's really related to their topic
 
02:03:21.470 --> 02:03:21.480 align:start position:0%
and they have a limited schedule we'll
 
02:03:23.089 --> 02:03:23.099 align:start position:0%
do our best to accommodate that they
 
02:03:24.290 --> 02:03:24.300 align:start position:0%
just need to communicate to the board
 
02:03:26.629 --> 02:03:26.639 align:start position:0%
and please communicate to the entire the
 
02:03:28.490 --> 02:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
entire commission so we we all know it
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
