00:09:55.730 --> 00:09:55.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.540 align:start position:0%
just to give you the lay of the land
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
today we will be addressing House Bill
 
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:04.320 align:start position:0%

we I am going to open up the exact
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
session and then I will immediately
 
00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:12.060 align:start position:0%
recess it until 1 30 today
 
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
and then we there's a bunch of
 
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
amendments flying around that severals
 
00:10:21.290 --> 00:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
have never seen so we'll then use the
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
next hour or so to talk through those
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
maybe do some straw poll votes just to
 
00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
see where people are at
 
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:31.560 align:start position:0%
break for lunch and during the lunch
 
00:10:33.829 --> 00:10:33.839 align:start position:0%
hopefully we've got good bipartisan
 
00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
consensus on where we end up and we come
 
00:10:39.889 --> 00:10:39.899 align:start position:0%
back at 1 30 to vote for a yes that's my
 
00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:51.120 align:start position:0%
sorry you said immediately recess
 
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:54.420 align:start position:0%
but on we need a little time to explain
 
00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:57.600 align:start position:0%
why the amendments are there yes so
 
00:10:58.970 --> 00:10:58.980 align:start position:0%
we're going to open it up we're going to
 
00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:00.360 align:start position:0%
recess it then we're going to do work
 
00:11:02.150 --> 00:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
session for about an hour hour and a
 
00:11:04.670 --> 00:11:04.680 align:start position:0%
half then we'll break for lunch come
 
00:11:07.009 --> 00:11:07.019 align:start position:0%
back and then exec hopefully around 1 30
 
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:09.420 align:start position:0%
ish we'll see how quickly we will not
 
00:11:17.509 --> 00:11:17.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
my amendments I I told oh okay so what
 
00:11:21.889 --> 00:11:21.899 align:start position:0%
we're going to do now we're gonna we're
 
00:11:23.329 --> 00:11:23.339 align:start position:0%
gonna go into work session effectively
 
00:11:25.069 --> 00:11:25.079 align:start position:0%
for an hour hour and a half to talk
 
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:26.880 align:start position:0%
about all the concepts that are floating
 
00:11:28.009 --> 00:11:28.019 align:start position:0%
around right now because I don't even
 
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
know what they all are and we'll talk
 
00:11:31.370 --> 00:11:31.380 align:start position:0%
through them quickly I do want to be
 
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:33.300 align:start position:0%
efficient with our time today we have
 
00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
had a very long work session and we've
 
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:37.200 align:start position:0%
done a lot of great work
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to keep that going we want
 
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:40.860 align:start position:0%
to kind of get to some decisions here so
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
that this afternoon we can definitely
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
execute with whatever amendments we
 
00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
think can fly okay and then of course
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
anyone can always do a floor Amendment
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
too but I would love to see what we can
 
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660 align:start position:0%
get consensus on here on this committee
 
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:54.300 align:start position:0%

for participating with us okay so the
 
00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
one amendment I am
 
00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:43.500 align:start position:0%
sure of because I've actually seen it
 
00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:45.839 align:start position:0%
and I heard about it is the one that
 
00:12:49.150 --> 00:12:49.160 align:start position:0%
came out of the work session last week
 
00:12:52.970 --> 00:12:52.980 align:start position:0%
that was worked on by everyone here but
 
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
has the name Doucette and spillsberry on
 
00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.200 align:start position:0%
it it has number
 
00:12:59.269 --> 00:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
1182h on it
 
00:13:01.430 --> 00:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
and again we're not an exec session now
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
we're in a work session but I am going
 
00:13:06.650 --> 00:13:06.660 align:start position:0%
to see if one of those two members could
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
talk about this amendment and explain it
 
00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:11.339 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:17.389 --> 00:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:13:17.399 --> 00:13:20.990 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
uh

00:13:20.990 --> 00:13:21.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:23.170 --> 00:13:23.180 align:start position:0%
so for the most part this amendment
 
00:13:25.550 --> 00:13:25.560 align:start position:0%
represents a faithful effort to
 
00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
incorporate uh the Crux of discussion
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
and where we seem to be settling last
 
00:13:31.079 --> 00:13:32.750 align:start position:0%
and where we seem to be settling last
Tuesday

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
 
00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:33.769 align:start position:0%
Tuesday
um

00:13:33.769 --> 00:13:33.779 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:36.829 --> 00:13:36.839 align:start position:0%
if I can just walk you through it
 
00:13:40.490 --> 00:13:40.500 align:start position:0%
make sure everyone is on board
 
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.569 align:start position:0%
make sure everyone is on board
um

00:13:41.569 --> 00:13:41.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:43.430 --> 00:13:43.440 align:start position:0%
if you have the amendment in front of
 
00:13:49.790 --> 00:13:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079 align:start position:0%
11 11
 
00:13:54.710 --> 00:13:54.720 align:start position:0%
8 2.
 
00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
I've got uh yeah excuse me one one eight
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
okay so 1182 appears to have been handed
 
00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:07.550 align:start position:0%
okay so 1182 appears to have been handed
out

00:14:07.550 --> 00:14:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:09.530 --> 00:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
does not have here it changed it's the
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
most recent one
 
00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:33.240 align:start position:0%
okay so there's a I guess there's a
 
00:14:35.810 --> 00:14:35.820 align:start position:0%
revised version which is the 1182 is
 
00:14:39.170 --> 00:14:39.180 align:start position:0%
that the one we you want us to look at
 
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:39.970 align:start position:0%
that the one we you want us to look at
it

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:39.980 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:42.720 align:start position:0%
I'm seeing 1182 for the first time it
 
00:14:48.710 --> 00:14:48.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:52.550 --> 00:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
782 it's March 22 and the date on 1201
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:01.370 --> 00:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
and I've seen 1182 for the first time so
 
00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:02.290 align:start position:0%
and I've seen 1182 for the first time so
um

00:15:02.290 --> 00:15:02.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:05.760 align:start position:0%
it does not have this 1182 does not have
 
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
the change that you made on page two
 
00:15:13.189 --> 00:15:13.199 align:start position:0%
most recently at line 24. I'm not quite
 
00:15:13.199 --> 00:15:14.090 align:start position:0%
most recently at line 24. I'm not quite
here

00:15:14.090 --> 00:15:14.100 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:15:16.970 --> 00:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
it does not have the change that you
 
00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:20.160 align:start position:0%
made most recently which is should have
 
00:15:24.189 --> 00:15:24.199 align:start position:0%
been a should be at page two line 24.
 
00:15:24.199 --> 00:15:25.910 align:start position:0%
been a should be at page two line 24.
22-24

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
22-24
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
yeah 22 to 20. yes that that which I sat
 
00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:30.420 align:start position:0%
around on Sunday hasn't been
 
00:15:32.329 --> 00:15:32.339 align:start position:0%
Incorporated by OLS yet so I'll address
 
00:15:34.730 --> 00:15:34.740 align:start position:0%
that yeah it's not here that's right
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
okay well okay so walk through one of
 
00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:39.060 align:start position:0%
them just pick one and walk through it
 
00:15:40.430 --> 00:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
and then because it sounds like no
 
00:15:41.689 --> 00:15:41.699 align:start position:0%
matter what we're gonna need to make
 
00:15:43.670 --> 00:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
sure there's some corrections
 
00:15:45.769 --> 00:15:45.779 align:start position:0%
I think they're the same just quickly
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
looking through them
 
00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:49.079 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment
 
00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
which runs lines 1 through 21.
 
00:15:59.269 --> 00:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
could not be simpler
 
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
it simply is changing online 21
 
00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
the little letter
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
C becomes a d becomes C
 
00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
and it's realigned that's all that
 
00:16:15.230 --> 00:16:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:17.150 --> 00:16:17.160 align:start position:0%
moving to the Second Amendment which
 
00:16:21.829 --> 00:16:21.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:25.970 --> 00:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
I withdraw this amendment this was a
 
00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:30.600 align:start position:0%
policy change and I'm gonna remove it
 
00:16:32.990 --> 00:16:33.000 align:start position:0%
what it related to was the question of
 
00:16:35.810 --> 00:16:35.820 align:start position:0%
opt-in versus opt out the bills that
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
came to us from the Commerce Committee
 
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:41.100 align:start position:0%
is a opt out provision meaning
 
00:16:43.730 --> 00:16:43.740 align:start position:0%
municipalities would have to have a
 
00:16:47.810 --> 00:16:47.820 align:start position:0%
local vote to uh to not participate and
 
00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
not allow a facility so we're just going
 
00:16:57.129 --> 00:16:57.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:00.230 --> 00:17:00.240 align:start position:0%
the third amendment
 
00:17:02.509 --> 00:17:02.519 align:start position:0%
begins at the bottom of page one on line
 
00:17:02.519 --> 00:17:04.069 align:start position:0%
begins at the bottom of page one on line
31.

00:17:04.069 --> 00:17:04.079 align:start position:0%
31.
 
00:17:09.289 --> 00:17:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:13.909 --> 00:17:13.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:16.010 --> 00:17:16.020 align:start position:0%
on line six
 
00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
we've truncated the sentence so that
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
we've dropped a final phrase that real
 
00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:24.120 align:start position:0%
that referred to an obsolete a
 
00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.270 align:start position:0%
 
Amendment

00:17:32.270 --> 00:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:37.630 align:start position:0%
Amendment
or

00:17:37.630 --> 00:17:37.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.330 --> 00:17:41.340 align:start position:0%
online 11 you see the first two words
 
00:17:44.870 --> 00:17:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
and all that's done is drop the word
 
00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:49.310 align:start position:0%
and all that's done is drop the word
cannabis

00:17:49.310 --> 00:17:49.320 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:17:52.549 --> 00:17:52.559 align:start position:0%
commission is a defined term
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
back on page three
 
00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:56.780 align:start position:0%
or four
 
00:17:59.630 --> 00:17:59.640 align:start position:0%
so so those amendments are purely
 
00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.090 align:start position:0%
so so those amendments are purely
technical

00:18:02.090 --> 00:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
technical
 
00:18:05.570 --> 00:18:05.580 align:start position:0%
amendment five begins on page two line
 
00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:07.909 align:start position:0%
amendment five begins on page two line
14.

00:18:07.909 --> 00:18:07.919 align:start position:0%
14.
 
00:18:12.490 --> 00:18:12.500 align:start position:0%
and runs through Page Three line nine
 
00:18:14.990 --> 00:18:15.000 align:start position:0%
this is
 
00:18:18.710 --> 00:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
the reallocation of how the funds will
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
be distributed
 
00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:22.620 align:start position:0%
and in a nutshell
 
00:18:25.010 --> 00:18:25.020 align:start position:0%
it shifts this from being primarily
 
00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:28.640 align:start position:0%
focused on reducing the unfunded
 
00:18:32.330 --> 00:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
liability in the retirement system
 
00:18:34.850 --> 00:18:34.860 align:start position:0%
to fifty percent of the total for
 
00:18:38.510 --> 00:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
Education thirty percent for retirement
 
00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
10 percent for DHS five percent for
 
00:18:44.570 --> 00:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety or safety uh
 
00:18:47.350 --> 00:18:47.360 align:start position:0%
entities and then another five percent
 
00:18:50.270 --> 00:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
so that the final three are targeted
 
00:18:52.789 --> 00:18:52.799 align:start position:0%
programs uh just as Ways and Means had
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
determined them last year
 
00:18:58.430 --> 00:18:58.440 align:start position:0%
and I believe that everybody was on
 
00:19:03.669 --> 00:19:03.679 align:start position:0%
board with this change on last Tuesday
 
00:19:03.679 --> 00:19:05.270 align:start position:0%
board with this change on last Tuesday
the

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:05.280 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
the modification that I will make when
 
00:19:11.510 --> 00:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
this goes back into a to OLS today
 
00:19:15.169 --> 00:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
is on lines 22 to 24.
 
00:19:18.010 --> 00:19:18.020 align:start position:0%
and inadvertently language was taken
 
00:19:20.930 --> 00:19:20.940 align:start position:0%
from a different source that wasn't the
 
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:22.070 align:start position:0%
from a different source that wasn't the
final

00:19:22.070 --> 00:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
final
 
00:19:25.789 --> 00:19:25.799 align:start position:0%
iteration of what we did last year in HP
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
15 98
 
00:19:30.650 --> 00:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
and that final iteration I'm referring
 
00:19:33.830 --> 00:19:33.840 align:start position:0%
to is exactly identical to what you find
 
00:19:37.730 --> 00:19:37.740 align:start position:0%
in this year's bill so if you look at HB
 
00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:39.169 align:start position:0%
in this year's bill so if you look at HB
639

00:19:39.169 --> 00:19:39.179 align:start position:0%
639
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
on page 22
 
00:19:44.090 --> 00:19:44.100 align:start position:0%
wait till you get there
 
00:19:44.100 --> 00:19:46.130 align:start position:0%
wait till you get there
on

00:19:46.130 --> 00:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:19:49.669 --> 00:19:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
this long provision starts with the idea
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
that if the retirement fund is fully
 
00:19:59.390 --> 00:19:59.400 align:start position:0%
funded then it goes to education so the
 
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
words we want to restore
 
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:06.000 align:start position:0%
begin towards the end of line two and go
 
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:08.400 align:start position:0%
to the end of line eight and that is to
 
00:20:08.400 --> 00:20:09.529 align:start position:0%
to the end of line eight and that is to
say

00:20:09.529 --> 00:20:09.539 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:20:12.409 --> 00:20:12.419 align:start position:0%
the percent shall be dispersed to the
 
00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
education trust fund
 
00:20:16.789 --> 00:20:16.799 align:start position:0%
the Comptroller shall notify the
 
00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner of the Department of
 
00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:19.860 align:start position:0%
Revenue administration of the amount of
 
00:20:21.169 --> 00:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
the transfer
 
00:20:23.029 --> 00:20:23.039 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of setting the education
 
00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:26.280 align:start position:0%
tax rate under RSA 763 the amount of
 
00:20:27.710 --> 00:20:27.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue required to be collected
 
00:20:31.310 --> 00:20:31.320 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 76 3 shall be reduced by
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
the amount transferred to the education
 
00:20:34.789 --> 00:20:34.799 align:start position:0%
trust fund is required in the
 
00:20:34.799 --> 00:20:36.409 align:start position:0%
trust fund is required in the
subparagraph

00:20:36.409 --> 00:20:36.419 align:start position:0%
subparagraph
 
00:20:38.330 --> 00:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
and the commissioner shall set the rate
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
at a level sufficient to generate the
 
00:20:42.350 --> 00:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
reduced amount this rate shall be
 
00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:45.360 align:start position:0%
effective for the following fiscal year
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
so this was inadvertently left out this
 
00:20:51.650 --> 00:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
is the the passage that we were
 
00:20:55.010 --> 00:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
discussing when Kim Wong from the dra
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
asked the question about the timing of
 
00:21:00.350 --> 00:21:00.360 align:start position:0%
the rate adjustment
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
and representative fellows and I were
 
00:21:04.789 --> 00:21:04.799 align:start position:0%
specifically going over this language so
 
00:21:07.549 --> 00:21:07.559 align:start position:0%
I'm simply going to restore this passage
 
00:21:10.549 --> 00:21:10.559 align:start position:0%
into the amendment
 
00:21:13.930 --> 00:21:13.940 align:start position:0%
and the thrust of it is this
 
00:21:17.210 --> 00:21:17.220 align:start position:0%
the language inadvertently used
 
00:21:20.690 --> 00:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
effectively says that
 
00:21:23.210 --> 00:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
um the proportionate amounts will be
 
00:21:25.610 --> 00:21:25.620 align:start position:0%
sent to the municipalities
 
00:21:28.250 --> 00:21:28.260 align:start position:0%
like a cash disbursement
 
00:21:30.529 --> 00:21:30.539 align:start position:0%
that wasn't our intent what this
 
00:21:32.750 --> 00:21:32.760 align:start position:0%
language does is it makes it clear
 
00:21:35.649 --> 00:21:35.659 align:start position:0%
that the the
 
00:21:38.270 --> 00:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
amounts attributable for each
 
00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:39.649 align:start position:0%
amounts attributable for each
municipality

00:21:39.649 --> 00:21:39.659 align:start position:0%
municipality
 
00:21:42.710 --> 00:21:42.720 align:start position:0%
will simply be recalculated by the dra
 
00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:44.220 align:start position:0%
when they set
 
00:21:47.330 --> 00:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
the swept rate for that municipality so
 
00:21:50.090 --> 00:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
it becomes a credit that reduces
 
00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:51.900 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that has to be
 
00:21:56.390 --> 00:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.090 --> 00:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
the but the money the cash stays at the
 
00:21:59.100 --> 00:22:00.409 align:start position:0%
the but the money the cash stays at the
state

00:22:00.409 --> 00:22:00.419 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:22:00.419 --> 00:22:01.730 align:start position:0%
state
okay

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:01.740 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.549 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:22:04.549 --> 00:22:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:10.789 --> 00:22:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.169 --> 00:22:15.179 align:start position:0%
the sixth amendment begins on line 11.
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
and runs to line 25.
 
00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:25.140 align:start position:0%
and this is the section that relates to
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
the tax itself
 
00:22:32.289 --> 00:22:32.299 align:start position:0%
and this incorporates all of the
 
00:22:35.149 --> 00:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
discussion and wordsmithing that we did
 
00:22:37.130 --> 00:22:37.140 align:start position:0%
last Tuesday
 
00:22:40.970 --> 00:22:40.980 align:start position:0%
so that it makes it clear that this is a
 
00:22:42.490 --> 00:22:42.500 align:start position:0%
excise tax
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
charged at the wholesale point where the
 
00:22:46.870 --> 00:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
sale is made
 
00:22:50.090 --> 00:22:50.100 align:start position:0%
to the retail store
 
00:22:52.490 --> 00:22:52.500 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer
 
00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:56.760 align:start position:0%
is the Cannabis cultivation facility or
 
00:22:58.490 --> 00:22:58.500 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis product manufacturing
 
00:23:02.630 --> 00:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
facility that has sold their goods and
 
00:23:05.090 --> 00:23:05.100 align:start position:0%
the tax applies to their monthly gross
 
00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.090 align:start position:0%
the tax applies to their monthly gross
revenue

00:23:08.090 --> 00:23:08.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:12.950 --> 00:23:12.960 align:start position:0%
um I did add one little phrase
 
00:23:15.409 --> 00:23:15.419 align:start position:0%
on line 15
 
00:23:17.390 --> 00:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
subsequent to our discussion last
 
00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:20.340 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and that is I inserted in their
 
00:23:21.770 --> 00:23:21.780 align:start position:0%
final form
 
00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
that's the phrase that the commissioner
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
used repeatedly
 
00:23:27.470 --> 00:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't make a difference whether
 
00:23:29.270 --> 00:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's something coming directly from a
 
00:23:31.970 --> 00:23:31.980 align:start position:0%
cultivator in a raw form to the retailer
 
00:23:35.450 --> 00:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
if that's its final form or whether it
 
00:23:37.909 --> 00:23:37.919 align:start position:0%
was converted into some kind of inedible
 
00:23:45.529 --> 00:23:45.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:49.280 align:start position:0%
I think there was a question
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
and you just you've just done a nice job
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
giving us the highlights of each of your
 
00:23:54.649 --> 00:23:54.659 align:start position:0%
amendments and then we'll go out and
 
00:23:56.810 --> 00:23:56.820 align:start position:0%
take some questions okay so so again
 
00:23:59.029 --> 00:23:59.039 align:start position:0%
this is exactly as we worked it out last
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
Tuesday with the exception of that
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
phrase in their final form which I think
 
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
just helps to clarify exactly what it is
 
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:07.260 align:start position:0%
we discussed
 
00:24:11.390 --> 00:24:11.400 align:start position:0%
Amendment seven starts on page three
 
00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:18.360 align:start position:0%
this is the last of these amendments
 
00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
and what this does is it reconciles
 
00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
that the use of the term biennium
 
00:24:30.710 --> 00:24:30.720 align:start position:0%
which is the way that it's used on page
 
00:24:30.720 --> 00:24:32.210 align:start position:0%
which is the way that it's used on page
21

00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:32.220 align:start position:0%
21
 
00:24:33.890 --> 00:24:33.900 align:start position:0%
so that the
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in line 29 and
 
00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:41.940 align:start position:0%
the two million dollars inline 34.
 
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:53.870 --> 00:24:53.880 align:start position:0%
I would just mention also
 
00:24:57.710 --> 00:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
that I saw this morning before heading
 
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:00.240 align:start position:0%
in that representative Ames
 
00:25:03.409 --> 00:25:03.419 align:start position:0%
has found several technical errors
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
basically citation flaws I've looked at
 
00:25:10.669 --> 00:25:10.679 align:start position:0%
them he's absolutely correct and I don't
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
think it's even worth discussing here
 
00:25:15.770 --> 00:25:15.780 align:start position:0%
but where he's he's found a reference to
 
00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:20.280 align:start position:0%
RSA 318 f24 it should be 318 F21 I've
 
00:25:23.029 --> 00:25:23.039 align:start position:0%
reviewed these they're accurate and I'll
 
00:25:25.130 --> 00:25:25.140 align:start position:0%
just incorporate them into our amendment
 
00:25:26.810 --> 00:25:26.820 align:start position:0%
I think that's the smoothest way to do
 
00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:30.480 align:start position:0%
it is that good with you okay thank you
 
00:25:32.029 --> 00:25:32.039 align:start position:0%
for that high level overview now I'm
 
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:32.940 align:start position:0%
sure you have lots of questions
 
00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:36.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:40.549 --> 00:25:40.559 align:start position:0%
and those those Errata are in my
 
00:25:43.669 --> 00:25:43.679 align:start position:0%
environment as well uh which is more of
 
00:25:46.970 --> 00:25:46.980 align:start position:0%
a technical Amendment but it's uh
 
00:25:50.269 --> 00:25:50.279 align:start position:0%
attached to what the medical treatment
 
00:25:52.570 --> 00:25:52.580 align:start position:0%
centers want
 
00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:55.080 align:start position:0%
which we they haven't been able to
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
present because
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
we never get to them before they have to
 
00:25:58.860 --> 00:25:59.769 align:start position:0%
we never get to them before they have to
leave

00:25:59.769 --> 00:25:59.779 align:start position:0%
leave
 
00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:01.860 align:start position:0%
and that's the same thing is going to
 
00:26:05.210 --> 00:26:05.220 align:start position:0%
happen today by the way okay
 
00:26:07.970 --> 00:26:07.980 align:start position:0%
um but um there are throughout here
 
00:26:10.850 --> 00:26:10.860 align:start position:0%
including in this amendment there are
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
references to the liquor and cannabis
 
00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.390 align:start position:0%
references to the liquor and cannabis
Commission

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
00:26:16.610 --> 00:26:16.620 align:start position:0%
which The Liquor Commission which
 
00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be present uh very much
 
00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:22.190 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be present uh very much
wants

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:22.200 align:start position:0%
wants
 
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
fixed because they have to completely
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
separate their liquor operations from
 
00:26:31.669 --> 00:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
the Cannabis operations
 
00:26:34.610 --> 00:26:34.620 align:start position:0%
just in case someone comes along to be
 
00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
president who wants to
 
00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:46.310 --> 00:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
so good if you look at page four
 
00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:50.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
commission is a defined term
 
00:26:56.690 --> 00:26:56.700 align:start position:0%
a mission means the liquor and
 
00:26:58.370 --> 00:26:58.380 align:start position:0%
just to clarify you're looking at the
 
00:26:59.570 --> 00:26:59.580 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
00:27:02.269 --> 00:27:02.279 align:start position:0%
I'm looking at 639 yes okay yeah just
 
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
sorry we got confused a little for a
 
00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:05.220 align:start position:0%
second there
 
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh so so from from that definition every
 
00:27:11.269 --> 00:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
reference throughout the rest of the
 
00:27:12.649 --> 00:27:12.659 align:start position:0%
bill should simply say cut the
 
00:27:12.659 --> 00:27:14.570 align:start position:0%
bill should simply say cut the
commission

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:16.740 align:start position:0%
is that essentially what you were saying
 
00:27:19.909 --> 00:27:19.919 align:start position:0%
we need to I'd missed this one too in
 
00:27:22.010 --> 00:27:22.020 align:start position:0%
definitions commission means liquor and
 
00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:23.450 align:start position:0%
definitions commission means liquor and
cannabis

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:23.460 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:25.310 align:start position:0%
cannabis
somehow

00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
somehow
 
00:27:27.890 --> 00:27:27.900 align:start position:0%
I missed that one I think representative
 
00:27:27.900 --> 00:27:28.789 align:start position:0%
I missed that one I think representative
Platt

00:27:28.789 --> 00:27:28.799 align:start position:0%
Platt
 
00:27:32.870 --> 00:27:32.880 align:start position:0%
I'm just a small suggestion on line 14
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
will says you say a tax on the monthly
 
00:27:41.390 --> 00:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
Etc which page page three line 14 of the
 
00:27:43.850 --> 00:27:43.860 align:start position:0%
amendment yeah you see a tax on the
 
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:46.080 align:start position:0%
monthly and this goes on yes why not
 
00:27:49.370 --> 00:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
insert change a to n excise
 
00:27:52.970 --> 00:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
thanks make it clear I'd be perfectly
 
00:27:55.130 --> 00:27:55.140 align:start position:0%
fine with that both in line 13 where
 
00:27:57.590 --> 00:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
there's a caption and in line 14 where
 
00:27:59.450 --> 00:27:59.460 align:start position:0%
it uh
 
00:28:01.789 --> 00:28:01.799 align:start position:0%
I mean if if that's the consensus I
 
00:28:04.850 --> 00:28:04.860 align:start position:0%
think that would be a wise idea
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
which page page three is the amendment
 
00:28:11.710 --> 00:28:11.720 align:start position:0%
lines 14 is what
 
00:28:17.210 --> 00:28:17.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.370 --> 00:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:28:22.010 --> 00:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
um some of you hopefully all of you have
 
00:28:24.590 --> 00:28:24.600 align:start position:0%
seen this uh on the table in front of
 
00:28:27.169 --> 00:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
you firstly I want to be clear that I am
 
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
not a mathematician and I'm really bad
 
00:28:31.850 --> 00:28:31.860 align:start position:0%
at spreadsheets so there are three cells
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
that I need to give you corrected number
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
that's under 30.
 
00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:38.100 align:start position:0%
on along the top where it says sales and
 
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:42.600 align:start position:0%
millions 30 the first line is 2.4 the
 
00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:45.299 align:start position:0%
next line is 3.3
 
00:28:48.409 --> 00:28:48.419 align:start position:0%
the next line is 4.5 and the last line
 
00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:52.860 align:start position:0%
in that section is 6.0 can you I will
 
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
read it again
 
00:28:57.409 --> 00:28:57.419 align:start position:0%
we're on under 30.
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
it's the column across the top says
 
00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:03.480 align:start position:0%
sales and millions under 30.
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
the first line is 2.4
 
00:29:11.470 --> 00:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
the next line should read 3.3 then 4.5
 
00:29:17.029 --> 00:29:17.039 align:start position:0%
and 6.0 and my apologies as I said
 
00:29:19.549 --> 00:29:19.559 align:start position:0%
math is and spreadsheets are not my
 
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
skills what I've been trying to do
 
00:29:23.630 --> 00:29:23.640 align:start position:0%
instead of saying well I like this
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
number and I like that number is figure
 
00:29:29.029 --> 00:29:29.039 align:start position:0%
out what it will actually cost to run
 
00:29:30.470 --> 00:29:30.480 align:start position:0%
the commission
 
00:29:34.310 --> 00:29:34.320 align:start position:0%
so what I did was take a look at sales
 
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
and millions across the top means sales
 
00:29:39.769 --> 00:29:39.779 align:start position:0%
and millions of dollars of product that
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
are sold at whatever level at whatever
 
00:29:45.769 --> 00:29:45.779 align:start position:0%
rate the retailer or the wholesaler
 
00:29:49.490 --> 00:29:49.500 align:start position:0%
chooses it's just what the sales are
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
and then looking at tax rates on the
 
00:29:54.950 --> 00:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
column on the left
 
00:29:58.610 --> 00:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
looking at eight percent 11 15 and 20
 
00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.289 align:start position:0%
looking at eight percent 11 15 and 20
percent

00:30:00.289 --> 00:30:00.299 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:30:03.289 --> 00:30:03.299 align:start position:0%
then the numbers in the cells on the
 
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:04.760 align:start position:0%
interior there
 
00:30:08.330 --> 00:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
indicate how much revenue
 
00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:11.700 align:start position:0%
will result from for example in the
 
00:30:14.930 --> 00:30:14.940 align:start position:0%
first cell if retails if sales at
 
00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:17.520 align:start position:0%
whatever level as I said are 12 million
 
00:30:20.389 --> 00:30:20.399 align:start position:0%
dollars taxed at eight points uh eight
 
00:30:24.350 --> 00:30:24.360 align:start position:0%
percent the revenue from that is 0.96
 
00:30:26.450 --> 00:30:26.460 align:start position:0%
million so nine hundred sixty thousand
 
00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:27.470 align:start position:0%
million so nine hundred sixty thousand
dollars

00:30:27.470 --> 00:30:27.480 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:30:31.789 --> 00:30:31.799 align:start position:0%
uh if it's a 18 million dollars in sales
 
00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:34.200 align:start position:0%
at eight percent one point four four
 
00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
million Etc
 
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:38.930 align:start position:0%
million Etc
um

00:30:38.930 --> 00:30:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
if the commission requires
 
00:30:45.350 --> 00:30:45.360 align:start position:0%
4.2 million dollars every year
 
00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
just for the ongoing maintenance of the
 
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.090 align:start position:0%
just for the ongoing maintenance of the
commission

00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
commission
 
00:30:50.100 --> 00:30:51.590 align:start position:0%
commission
then

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
we don't get anywhere near that at eight
 
00:30:56.399 --> 00:30:57.649 align:start position:0%
we don't get anywhere near that at eight
percent

00:30:57.649 --> 00:30:57.659 align:start position:0%
percent
 
00:31:00.830 --> 00:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
until and I didn't get this in until we
 
00:31:03.529 --> 00:31:03.539 align:start position:0%
have sales of 53 million at whatever
 
00:31:03.539 --> 00:31:05.149 align:start position:0%
have sales of 53 million at whatever
level

00:31:05.149 --> 00:31:05.159 align:start position:0%
level
 
00:31:05.159 --> 00:31:06.289 align:start position:0%
level
so

00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:06.299 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:08.510 --> 00:31:08.520 align:start position:0%
53 million dollars whether it's at
 
00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640 align:start position:0%
wholesale retail seed whatever level
 
00:31:14.690 --> 00:31:14.700 align:start position:0%
we're looking at we need 53 million
 
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
dollars at eight percent just to cover
 
00:31:20.750 --> 00:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
the cost of running the commission
 
00:31:24.529 --> 00:31:24.539 align:start position:0%
we're also coming in with at least 15
 
00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:27.360 align:start position:0%
million dollars we being the state
 
00:31:29.870 --> 00:31:29.880 align:start position:0%
coming in with at least 15 million
 
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
dollars that the commission will have to
 
00:31:37.850 --> 00:31:37.860 align:start position:0%
repay the state for startup costs I just
 
00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:39.840 align:start position:0%
again played with numbers and said if we
 
00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
try to add two percent uh the 2 million
 
00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:46.740 align:start position:0%
to the 4.2 million this is the stuff at
 
00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
00:31:51.169 --> 00:31:51.179 align:start position:0%
um if we need to make 4.2 million
 
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
on 12 million dollars annual sales the
 
00:32:01.010 --> 00:32:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
these are just the numbers
 
00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
uh if we go up to 36 million
 
00:32:12.169 --> 00:32:12.179 align:start position:0%
we need to have a tax rate of 11.67
 
00:32:14.029 --> 00:32:14.039 align:start position:0%
. so what I'm trying to do here is say
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
instead of just saying I like this
 
00:32:18.649 --> 00:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
number I like that number what do we
 
00:32:21.889 --> 00:32:21.899 align:start position:0%
actually need to run the commission
 
00:32:24.769 --> 00:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
even before we look at revenue for the
 
00:32:25.970 --> 00:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
things that we're talking about
 
00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:29.460 align:start position:0%
providing money for Education money to
 
00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:32.520 align:start position:0%
cut down the retirement commitment that
 
00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:34.260 align:start position:0%
we have and all the other pieces that
 
00:32:37.850 --> 00:32:37.860 align:start position:0%
we're talking about and based on this
 
00:32:40.909 --> 00:32:40.919 align:start position:0%
particularly if we're looking at
 
00:32:44.510 --> 00:32:44.520 align:start position:0%
sales uh doing an excise tax at the
 
00:32:45.950 --> 00:32:45.960 align:start position:0%
wholesale level
 
00:32:47.990 --> 00:32:48.000 align:start position:0%
we're going to need to be
 
00:32:51.590 --> 00:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
getting a whole lot of Revenue that I
 
00:32:54.490 --> 00:32:54.500 align:start position:0%
don't see that we're going to get
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
15 comes a whole lot closer it's not
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
great but eight million eight percent to
 
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
me just doesn't make sense based on
 
00:33:07.010 --> 00:33:07.020 align:start position:0%
these numbers and I'm happy to answer
 
00:33:09.470 --> 00:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
any questions that you may have I know
 
00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:11.700 align:start position:0%
my brain works one way other people's
 
00:33:15.789 --> 00:33:15.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:17.389 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:17.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:33:20.870 --> 00:33:20.880 align:start position:0%
um I think as part of the spillsbury
 
00:33:22.909 --> 00:33:22.919 align:start position:0%
Doucet Amendment there was a
 
00:33:26.330 --> 00:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
contemplation of changing the rate to
 
00:33:28.549 --> 00:33:28.559 align:start position:0%
eight percent
 
00:33:31.130 --> 00:33:31.140 align:start position:0%
it based on your analysis what would you
 
00:33:31.140 --> 00:33:32.690 align:start position:0%
it based on your analysis what would you
recommend

00:33:32.690 --> 00:33:32.700 align:start position:0%
recommend
 
00:33:34.789 --> 00:33:34.799 align:start position:0%
15 at least
 
00:33:37.549 --> 00:33:37.559 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
00:33:39.889 --> 00:33:39.899 align:start position:0%
yes have we had any estimates of what
 
00:33:43.250 --> 00:33:43.260 align:start position:0%
revenues might be from uh sales and
 
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.059 align:start position:0%
millions not our revenues but sales and
 
00:33:47.470 --> 00:33:47.480 align:start position:0%
millions might be for New Hampshire
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
compared to other states and our
 
00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.970 align:start position:0%
compared to other states and our
population

00:33:52.970 --> 00:33:52.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.190 --> 00:33:55.200 align:start position:0%
I I certainly haven't I did a quick
 
00:33:58.130 --> 00:33:58.140 align:start position:0%
check with May on Main because Maine's
 
00:34:00.889 --> 00:34:00.899 align:start position:0%
population is roughly similar to ours
 
00:34:05.330 --> 00:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
and their retail sales in 2021 were 82
 
00:34:09.169 --> 00:34:09.179 align:start position:0%
million and in 2022 159 million but that
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
was at the retail level
 
00:34:15.409 --> 00:34:15.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.810 --> 00:34:17.820 align:start position:0%
representative yes thank you madam chair
 
00:34:20.290 --> 00:34:20.300 align:start position:0%
just to answer representative plett's
 
00:34:23.329 --> 00:34:23.339 align:start position:0%
question when Vermont did this and
 
00:34:25.490 --> 00:34:25.500 align:start position:0%
opened up their stores I think it was
 
00:34:28.970 --> 00:34:28.980 align:start position:0%
October their first month's Revenue was
 
00:34:32.149 --> 00:34:32.159 align:start position:0%
just under three million dollars uh I
 
00:34:34.550 --> 00:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
believe so um and I think they had
 
00:34:37.490 --> 00:34:37.500 align:start position:0%
supply issues as well so that's I want
 
00:34:40.250 --> 00:34:40.260 align:start position:0%
to say it was 2.75 and they were running
 
00:34:43.550 --> 00:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
out of product so assuming that they
 
00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
have plenty of product I think you can
 
00:34:48.470 --> 00:34:48.480 align:start position:0%
make an estimate considerably higher
 
00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
than that
 
00:34:53.210 --> 00:34:53.220 align:start position:0%
so I think we heard oh did I miss a hand
 
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
up here so okay I think we heard that
 
00:34:58.070 --> 00:34:58.080 align:start position:0%
there are lots of Concepts in here there
 
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
are some technical reference Corrections
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
citation Corrections that need to be
 
00:35:05.990 --> 00:35:06.000 align:start position:0%
fixed there's a couple of OLS errors in
 
00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.310 align:start position:0%
fixed there's a couple of OLS errors in
here

00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
but you understand the underlying
 
00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:12.660 align:start position:0%
concept here so I'm thinking it might be
 
00:35:15.170 --> 00:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
worth taking a straw poll just to see
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
where we are on this amendment as a
 
00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220 align:start position:0%
whole and go from there if there's broad
 
00:35:22.730 --> 00:35:22.740 align:start position:0%
support or enough support
 
00:35:24.170 --> 00:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
then we know and we can go on to the
 
00:35:28.010 --> 00:35:28.020 align:start position:0%
next Amendment all right so yes other
 
00:35:30.890 --> 00:35:30.900 align:start position:0%
things representatively could I ask a
 
00:35:32.930 --> 00:35:32.940 align:start position:0%
clarifying question absolutely
 
00:35:36.950 --> 00:35:36.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm on the spillsbury Ducette
 
00:35:41.170 --> 00:35:41.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:45.540 align:start position:0%
line 23 where we're talking about the
 
00:35:49.130 --> 00:35:49.140 align:start position:0%
distributions on the education
 
00:35:52.010 --> 00:35:52.020 align:start position:0%
supporting education
 
00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:53.750 align:start position:0%
supporting education
and

00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:57.020 align:start position:0%
um my question is you clarified
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities would receive a
 
00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.750 align:start position:0%
that the municipalities would receive a
credit

00:36:02.750 --> 00:36:02.760 align:start position:0%
credit
 
00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:04.320 align:start position:0%
um and that the money would stay at the
 
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
state so I just want to think make sure
 
00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking about this correctly so
 
00:36:12.250 --> 00:36:12.260 align:start position:0%
basically 50
 
00:36:16.849 --> 00:36:16.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:22.010 --> 00:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
would be directed at education but
 
00:36:24.530 --> 00:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
is another way of saying that that where
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
that money is going is is actually it's
 
00:36:31.490 --> 00:36:31.500 align:start position:0%
not really to education it's to relieve
 
00:36:33.530 --> 00:36:33.540 align:start position:0%
property taxes
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
for municipalities
 
00:36:37.550 --> 00:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
am I getting that right that's that's
 
00:36:39.650 --> 00:36:39.660 align:start position:0%
exactly correct
 
00:36:39.660 --> 00:36:40.550 align:start position:0%
exactly correct
um

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:36:44.210 --> 00:36:44.220 align:start position:0%
so I believe you and I uh maybe it was
 
00:36:47.510 --> 00:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
rep elburger and I made that observation
 
00:36:48.950 --> 00:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:51.960 align:start position:0%
um representative Ames later echoed it
 
00:36:56.390 --> 00:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
this doesn't increase education funding
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
this finds a new source to help
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
alleviate the extent to which education
 
00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:04.920 align:start position:0%
funding Falls further on the real
 
00:37:08.210 --> 00:37:08.220 align:start position:0%
property tax via the swept by reducing
 
00:37:10.730 --> 00:37:10.740 align:start position:0%
the swept
 
00:37:16.069 --> 00:37:16.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:18.950 --> 00:37:18.960 align:start position:0%
and again this is just a part of the
 
00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
revenue we're generating right it's not
 
00:37:23.690 --> 00:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
the entire Revenue 50 right so an
 
00:37:25.790 --> 00:37:25.800 align:start position:0%
important part of it so an important
 
00:37:28.609 --> 00:37:28.619 align:start position:0%
part of the revenue for this bill
 
00:37:31.130 --> 00:37:31.140 align:start position:0%
isn't really Revenue right it's not new
 
00:37:35.210 --> 00:37:35.220 align:start position:0%
revenue for the state it's replacing one
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
source of Revenue
 
00:37:40.010 --> 00:37:40.020 align:start position:0%
um with another one so it's not
 
00:37:42.650 --> 00:37:42.660 align:start position:0%
increasing Revenue to the state it's
 
00:37:44.990 --> 00:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
making it so the cities have to
 
00:37:46.490 --> 00:37:46.500 align:start position:0%
contribute less
 
00:37:49.970 --> 00:37:49.980 align:start position:0%
to the state so I I'm trying to think
 
00:37:49.980 --> 00:37:51.470 align:start position:0%
to the state so I I'm trying to think
about

00:37:51.470 --> 00:37:51.480 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:53.700 align:start position:0%
what the bill does in a couple different
 
00:37:56.690 --> 00:37:56.700 align:start position:0%
ways so I'm thinking that we're
 
00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%
discussing an excise tax and we're
 
00:38:00.109 --> 00:38:00.119 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out what the rate is
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
where we're going to stick it but one of
 
00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
the big things it does is not generate
 
00:38:08.510 --> 00:38:08.520 align:start position:0%
new Revenue but
 
00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:10.970 align:start position:0%
new Revenue but
relieve

00:38:10.970 --> 00:38:10.980 align:start position:0%
relieve
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
property tax pressures on citizens
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
so we we need to be careful about the
 
00:38:22.190 --> 00:38:22.200 align:start position:0%
semantics it generates new Revenue
 
00:38:26.690 --> 00:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
from a new source thereby allowing us to
 
00:38:28.790 --> 00:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
make a judgment
 
00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
that we can reduce the amount of Revenue
 
00:38:33.650 --> 00:38:33.660 align:start position:0%
that we need to raise
 
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
through the swept
 
00:38:39.710 --> 00:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
by surcharging the real property tax
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
and I have to say if if I was in a
 
00:38:44.690 --> 00:38:44.700 align:start position:0%
conversation with
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
any of my constituents they don't view
 
00:38:51.109 --> 00:38:51.119 align:start position:0%
the swept tax as a state tax technically
 
00:38:54.050 --> 00:38:54.060 align:start position:0%
it is but it's collected on the back of
 
00:38:56.630 --> 00:38:56.640 align:start position:0%
the real estate value
 
00:38:59.510 --> 00:38:59.520 align:start position:0%
it's collected in the town it's paid
 
00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:02.940 align:start position:0%
together with their real estate bill
 
00:39:05.150 --> 00:39:05.160 align:start position:0%
and it's retained in the town and then
 
00:39:07.329 --> 00:39:07.339 align:start position:0%
turned over to the school district so
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
yes this is allowing us to make a
 
00:39:10.680 --> 00:39:12.890 align:start position:0%
yes this is allowing us to make a
substitution

00:39:12.890 --> 00:39:12.900 align:start position:0%
substitution
 
00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:14.460 align:start position:0%
so the
 
00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:16.740 align:start position:0%
place where I'm trying to arrive with
 
00:39:20.930 --> 00:39:20.940 align:start position:0%
that is I think we all share the the
 
00:39:23.750 --> 00:39:23.760 align:start position:0%
point of view that property taxes are a
 
00:39:26.569 --> 00:39:26.579 align:start position:0%
pain point for our constituents they're
 
00:39:29.810 --> 00:39:29.820 align:start position:0%
very high and we all would like to lower
 
00:39:34.010 --> 00:39:34.020 align:start position:0%
them and this bill does that in a small
 
00:39:34.020 --> 00:39:34.870 align:start position:0%
them and this bill does that in a small
way

00:39:34.870 --> 00:39:34.880 align:start position:0%
way
 
00:39:38.390 --> 00:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
and as we adjust the rate that we're
 
00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:39.770 align:start position:0%
and as we adjust the rate that we're
discussing

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:39.780 align:start position:0%
discussing
 
00:39:42.290 --> 00:39:42.300 align:start position:0%
it might do that in a bigger or smaller
 
00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
way as we adjust that rate between like
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
eight percent fifteen percent wholesale
 
00:39:49.790 --> 00:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
retail so I just want to add that to
 
00:39:52.670 --> 00:39:52.680 align:start position:0%
kind of how we're thinking about this
 
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
um that that is one of the variables
 
00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:57.349 align:start position:0%
um that that is one of the variables
that

00:39:57.349 --> 00:39:57.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:40:00.290 --> 00:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
it's a direct impact
 
00:40:02.210 --> 00:40:02.220 align:start position:0%
um in that way that is a little bit
 
00:40:04.310 --> 00:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
different than when we usually just talk
 
00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.150 align:start position:0%
different than when we usually just talk
about

00:40:05.150 --> 00:40:05.160 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:07.260 align:start position:0%
generating Revenue I just want to make
 
00:40:08.329 --> 00:40:08.339 align:start position:0%
sure I was thinking about that right
 
00:40:10.250 --> 00:40:10.260 align:start position:0%
before we proceeded representative
 
00:40:12.589 --> 00:40:12.599 align:start position:0%
Southward thank you has his things
 
00:40:15.589 --> 00:40:15.599 align:start position:0%
standing up for you
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
um as a follow-up so what happened in
 
00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
the previous budget we did take was it
 
00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:24.300 align:start position:0%
50 million a year towards reducing swept
 
00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
it was 100 million per year
 
00:40:29.870 --> 00:40:29.880 align:start position:0%
so as a as a taxpayer that didn't have
 
00:40:32.089 --> 00:40:32.099 align:start position:0%
much effect on me that I could tell in
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
meeting with my city manager and going
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
over that impact our school costs
 
00:40:39.650 --> 00:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
actually did go up with less state aid
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
um but also this will be a lot less than
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
a hundred million a year that's going to
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
help the taxpayers so it just just
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
seemed to me that it's a very small
 
00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:50.930 align:start position:0%
seemed to me that it's a very small
amount

00:40:50.930 --> 00:40:50.940 align:start position:0%
amount
 
00:40:53.089 --> 00:40:53.099 align:start position:0%
um and unless I'm doing the figures
 
00:40:53.099 --> 00:40:55.370 align:start position:0%
um and unless I'm doing the figures
wrong

00:40:55.370 --> 00:40:55.380 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
representative Ames
 
00:40:59.390 --> 00:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
I was actually asking um representative
 
00:41:02.210 --> 00:41:02.220 align:start position:0%
spilsbury well I can come in go ahead
 
00:41:03.589 --> 00:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
and comment representative Ames and then
 
00:41:05.690 --> 00:41:05.700 align:start position:0%
we'll see if there's others yeah I think
 
00:41:09.170 --> 00:41:09.180 align:start position:0%
the point is well made that um if
 
00:41:12.609 --> 00:41:12.619 align:start position:0%
let's I think this is optimistic uh
 
00:41:15.650 --> 00:41:15.660 align:start position:0%
Mystic to say that we'll be able to put
 
00:41:18.650 --> 00:41:18.660 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars into that 50 that
 
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
allocation that goes to swept relief
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
20 million dollars
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
of 363 million dollars it would be
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
reduction from 363 million is about a
 
00:41:33.530 --> 00:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
seven percent
 
00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:35.390 align:start position:0%
seven percent
reduction

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
00:41:38.109 --> 00:41:38.119 align:start position:0%
of the swept rate the swept rate
 
00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:41.940 align:start position:0%
equalizes a dollar 44 currently
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
for a thousand
 
00:41:46.250 --> 00:41:46.260 align:start position:0%
so you take seven percent of that you're
 
00:41:49.670 --> 00:41:49.680 align:start position:0%
down to something like
 
00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
0.1 uh at ten dollars per thousand
 
00:41:58.310 --> 00:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
no I'm doing it wrong 10 cents for for a
 
00:41:59.450 --> 00:41:59.460 align:start position:0%
thousand or somewhere like that you get
 
00:42:01.370 --> 00:42:01.380 align:start position:0%
a small amount I I'm not going to try to
 
00:42:03.710 --> 00:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
do it in my head but and then you
 
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:05.760 align:start position:0%
multiply it by let's say a hundred
 
00:42:07.069 --> 00:42:07.079 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars you've got a lot of
 
00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:09.660 align:start position:0%
trailer homes in your town I know that
 
00:42:14.690 --> 00:42:14.700 align:start position:0%
that are at low values or maybe uh in
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
other towns let's say three hundred
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars you get maybe ten
 
00:42:23.390 --> 00:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
twenty thirty dollars of tax relief it's
 
00:42:26.030 --> 00:42:26.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
okay we're going to take a straw poll
 
00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:29.579 align:start position:0%
soon there's a whole bunch of hands over
 
00:42:30.950 --> 00:42:30.960 align:start position:0%
here we'll go back around and then we'll
 
00:42:32.690 --> 00:42:32.700 align:start position:0%
take a straw poll representative orrs
 
00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:35.960 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so if Maine is
 
00:42:40.250 --> 00:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
selling at retail 82 million in 2021 and
 
00:42:43.670 --> 00:42:43.680 align:start position:0%
159 million in 2022
 
00:42:46.190 --> 00:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
through to covid it would seem to me if
 
00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
initially we started at 15 at the
 
00:42:52.010 --> 00:42:52.020 align:start position:0%
cultivation grower level
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
as we come up the food chain like The
 
00:42:57.550 --> 00:42:57.560 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission recommended and we tax
 
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
excise tax whatever you want to call it
 
00:43:03.950 --> 00:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
on the final form product we are going
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
to need less tax
 
00:43:10.370 --> 00:43:10.380 align:start position:0%
and I also want to remind everybody from
 
00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:13.200 align:start position:0%
the information we have provided that I
 
00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:14.270 align:start position:0%
the information we have provided that I
asked

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280 align:start position:0%
asked
 
00:43:16.550 --> 00:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
I think was the head of the Cannabis
 
00:43:19.010 --> 00:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
group here in New Hampshire about where
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
did they get their stats from they
 
00:43:23.569 --> 00:43:23.579 align:start position:0%
provided some pretty good stats and if
 
00:43:26.690 --> 00:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
we legalize cannabis it's gonna take
 
00:43:29.150 --> 00:43:29.160 align:start position:0%
away cannabis from youth because it
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
should dry up the black market and they
 
00:43:33.770 --> 00:43:33.780 align:start position:0%
would have to buy it after retail market
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
so we need to remember that I think it's
 
00:43:39.710 --> 00:43:39.720 align:start position:0%
more important that we keep cannabis
 
00:43:41.770 --> 00:43:41.780 align:start position:0%
away from children
 
00:43:44.870 --> 00:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
by legalizing if we're going to legalize
 
00:43:48.230 --> 00:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
it and the revenue is not that important
 
00:43:50.569 --> 00:43:50.579 align:start position:0%
I mean if we didn't legalize cannabis
 
00:43:52.309 --> 00:43:52.319 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be any Revenue so there
 
00:43:54.109 --> 00:43:54.119 align:start position:0%
will be additional Revenue but I think
 
00:43:55.970 --> 00:43:55.980 align:start position:0%
it's more important to dry up the black
 
00:43:58.730 --> 00:43:58.740 align:start position:0%
market and keep cannabis out of the
 
00:44:00.890 --> 00:44:00.900 align:start position:0%
hands of the youth thank you
 
00:44:03.290 --> 00:44:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative Elber
 
00:44:05.210 --> 00:44:05.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
if we're looking as this bill
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
points out that the tax rate will be
 
00:44:16.609 --> 00:44:16.619 align:start position:0%
imposed at the wholesale level
 
00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:19.740 align:start position:0%
we've heard from at least one source
 
00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:20.510 align:start position:0%
we've heard from at least one source
that

00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:44:22.010 --> 00:44:22.020 align:start position:0%
you need
 
00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
three to four times
 
00:44:26.870 --> 00:44:26.880 align:start position:0%
at the wholesale level to make what you
 
00:44:28.990 --> 00:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
would get at the retail level
 
00:44:32.690 --> 00:44:32.700 align:start position:0%
then again just looking at Maine from
 
00:44:35.630 --> 00:44:35.640 align:start position:0%
last year when they made 159 million
 
00:44:38.630 --> 00:44:38.640 align:start position:0%
dollars in retail sales and divide that
 
00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:40.619 align:start position:0%
by three we're looking at about 53
 
00:44:43.849 --> 00:44:43.859 align:start position:0%
million here which is barely enough to
 
00:44:46.609 --> 00:44:46.619 align:start position:0%
cover our commission costs
 
00:44:49.550 --> 00:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
so we're not seeing anything to cover
 
00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
the debt to provide any kind of relief
 
00:44:57.589 --> 00:44:57.599 align:start position:0%
for swept or anything else and
 
00:45:00.050 --> 00:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
um to shift gears and follow up on
 
00:45:05.990 --> 00:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:08.390 --> 00:45:08.400 align:start position:0%
cutback on
 
00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers of swept however much
 
00:45:13.490 --> 00:45:13.500 align:start position:0%
that rate would be
 
00:45:16.250 --> 00:45:16.260 align:start position:0%
if the state has to absorb that into the
 
00:45:18.190 --> 00:45:18.200 align:start position:0%
360 million
 
00:45:20.569 --> 00:45:20.579 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars in the education
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
trust fund Whatever Gets absorbed that
 
00:45:26.030 --> 00:45:26.040 align:start position:0%
there unless there's some other Revenue
 
00:45:28.910 --> 00:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
will mean lower
 
00:45:32.329 --> 00:45:32.339 align:start position:0%
funding for other programs
 
00:45:35.329 --> 00:45:35.339 align:start position:0%
at no let me try that again play with
 
00:45:39.770 --> 00:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
numbers if we get 20 million dollars to
 
00:45:42.890 --> 00:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
go to relief to taxpayers
 
00:45:44.870 --> 00:45:44.880 align:start position:0%
on the swept level we are still
 
00:45:47.930 --> 00:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
committed to 363 million dollars for
 
00:45:49.910 --> 00:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
sweat for the education trust fund
 
00:45:49.920 --> 00:45:51.829 align:start position:0%
sweat for the education trust fund
correct

00:45:51.829 --> 00:45:51.839 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:45:55.010 --> 00:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
that means the difference has to be made
 
00:45:57.890 --> 00:45:57.900 align:start position:0%
up by general fund sources unless it's
 
00:46:00.230 --> 00:46:00.240 align:start position:0%
coming up from somewhere else
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know if they take 20 million out
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:08.030 --> 00:46:08.040 align:start position:0%
okay I want to keep going around the
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
room quick comments clarifications on
 
00:46:12.050 --> 00:46:12.060 align:start position:0%
this before we stop we'll representative
 
00:46:14.089 --> 00:46:14.099 align:start position:0%
putt question on the straw poll you're
 
00:46:16.910 --> 00:46:16.920 align:start position:0%
about to take is that for all of the uh
 
00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
21182h plus some minor changes that we
 
00:46:27.530 --> 00:46:27.540 align:start position:0%
discussed Inc including the uh eight
 
00:46:29.450 --> 00:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
percent rate or was it other than the
 
00:46:31.670 --> 00:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
rate it is this amendment with all the
 
00:46:32.809 --> 00:46:32.819 align:start position:0%
technical Corrections that were
 
00:46:32.819 --> 00:46:34.309 align:start position:0%
technical Corrections that were
referenced

00:46:34.309 --> 00:46:34.319 align:start position:0%
referenced
 
00:46:37.190 --> 00:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
as is with all the technical Corrections
 
00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.450 align:start position:0%
as is with all the technical Corrections
okay

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:38.460 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:46:41.210 --> 00:46:41.220 align:start position:0%
yeah rates right here so it's all of it
 
00:46:43.490 --> 00:46:43.500 align:start position:0%
including everything in here with the
 
00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
technical Corrections that
 
00:46:46.849 --> 00:46:46.859 align:start position:0%
representative spielsberg identified
 
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
okay so just so we can see where we are
 
00:46:51.290 --> 00:46:51.300 align:start position:0%
on that representative aim Matt
 
00:46:58.750 --> 00:46:58.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:02.150 --> 00:47:02.160 align:start position:0%
might I suggest that we if you're going
 
00:47:04.130 --> 00:47:04.140 align:start position:0%
to do a straw poll I know we all have
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
different uh positions or figures in a
 
00:47:08.630 --> 00:47:08.640 align:start position:0%
head we can talk about the amendment
 
00:47:11.870 --> 00:47:11.880 align:start position:0%
with the technical changes and leave out
 
00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119 align:start position:0%
the component of the tax rate
 
00:47:16.849 --> 00:47:16.859 align:start position:0%
for the straw poll because I don't know
 
00:47:19.370 --> 00:47:19.380 align:start position:0%
that we'll get a true pulse of what the
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
committee wants to do until such a time
 
00:47:22.849 --> 00:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
we come to an agreement where we should
 
00:47:24.730 --> 00:47:24.740 align:start position:0%
be in that
 
00:47:28.010 --> 00:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
and moreover just just to some of the
 
00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:30.780 align:start position:0%
commentary that was made here any tax
 
00:47:33.290 --> 00:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
relief at least for my constituents any
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
tax relief is good tax relief it's it's
 
00:47:37.490 --> 00:47:37.500 align:start position:0%
if it's 30 or 40 dollars I know that
 
00:47:40.130 --> 00:47:40.140 align:start position:0%
that buys a couple boxes of diapers or
 
00:47:42.410 --> 00:47:42.420 align:start position:0%
whatever and I know that may seem Petty
 
00:47:44.390 --> 00:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
to some people but to some of the people
 
00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
that I speak to it's important tax
 
00:47:50.569 --> 00:47:50.579 align:start position:0%
relief so we we can't solve the problems
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
of the world with one piece of
 
00:47:55.430 --> 00:47:55.440 align:start position:0%
legislation on one Revenue Source but we
 
00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
can start cracking at the seal
 
00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
okay I promise to keep going around this
 
00:48:02.809 --> 00:48:02.819 align:start position:0%
way representative all me is on now good
 
00:48:05.690 --> 00:48:05.700 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah on
 
00:48:10.250 --> 00:48:10.260 align:start position:0%
first on when we look at 150 something
 
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
million for Maine
 
00:48:15.589 --> 00:48:15.599 align:start position:0%
they are undoubtedly taking money from
 
00:48:18.050 --> 00:48:18.060 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and from us
 
00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:21.119 align:start position:0%
that is Incorporated in there at this
 
00:48:24.410 --> 00:48:24.420 align:start position:0%
point they are a tourism destination
 
00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:25.370 align:start position:0%
point they are a tourism destination
um

00:48:25.370 --> 00:48:25.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
so I would more believe there are 82
 
00:48:35.210 --> 00:48:35.220 align:start position:0%
million but Maine taxes at three levels
 
00:48:37.490 --> 00:48:37.500 align:start position:0%
they have a cultivator tax they have an
 
00:48:39.950 --> 00:48:39.960 align:start position:0%
excise tax and they have a sales tax
 
00:48:43.250 --> 00:48:43.260 align:start position:0%
we have no way at this point of finding
 
00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:47.700 align:start position:0%
out what pers what part of that Revenue
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
is simply the wholesale tax
 
00:48:54.109 --> 00:48:54.119 align:start position:0%
the excise I presume that's their excise
 
00:48:54.119 --> 00:48:55.550 align:start position:0%
the excise I presume that's their excise
tax

00:48:55.550 --> 00:48:55.560 align:start position:0%
tax
 
00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:56.450 align:start position:0%
tax
um

00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:59.690 --> 00:48:59.700 align:start position:0%
and we have this problem with all the
 
00:49:01.550 --> 00:49:01.560 align:start position:0%
other places that we're looking at too
 
00:49:03.770 --> 00:49:03.780 align:start position:0%
we should have started working on this
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
last summer when they worked on the
 
00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
other parts of the policy but they
 
00:49:09.730 --> 00:49:09.740 align:start position:0%
didn't invite us
 
00:49:11.690 --> 00:49:11.700 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
it's so we're
 
00:49:17.270 --> 00:49:17.280 align:start position:0%
whistling in the dark pretty much tax
 
00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:20.460 align:start position:0%
Foundation said 44 million for New
 
00:49:22.190 --> 00:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we have no idea how they got
 
00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:23.460 align:start position:0%
that number
 
00:49:30.230 --> 00:49:30.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:32.630 --> 00:49:32.640 align:start position:0%
the size of the dartboard that's pretty
 
00:49:35.270 --> 00:49:35.280 align:start position:0%
much where we are and that's a shame for
 
00:49:37.370 --> 00:49:37.380 align:start position:0%
a Ways and Means Committee but that's
 
00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:39.720 align:start position:0%
what we've got to deal with we got this
 
00:49:42.109 --> 00:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
bill really late in addition to the fact
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
that we should have started on it last
 
00:49:47.210 --> 00:49:47.220 align:start position:0%
summer but
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400 align:start position:0%
uh I've forgotten
 
00:49:56.870 --> 00:49:56.880 align:start position:0%
what the rest of my comment was so well
 
00:49:59.150 --> 00:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
keep in mind I know we're all trying to
 
00:50:01.790 --> 00:50:01.800 align:start position:0%
do our best best job to get this as good
 
00:50:04.849 --> 00:50:04.859 align:start position:0%
as possible however we all know
 
00:50:07.550 --> 00:50:07.560 align:start position:0%
there will be opportunities for new
 
00:50:09.770 --> 00:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
bills next year as we learn more about
 
00:50:11.329 --> 00:50:11.339 align:start position:0%
this and as we move forward there's
 
00:50:12.829 --> 00:50:12.839 align:start position:0%
probably going to be bills every year to
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
keep tweaking this to get it to be right
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire okay we do have a
 
00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:18.829 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire okay we do have a
problem

00:50:18.829 --> 00:50:18.839 align:start position:0%
problem
 
00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:22.560 align:start position:0%
of basic policy which is whether this
 
00:50:25.790 --> 00:50:25.800 align:start position:0%
bill as it was created by the people who
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
put it in on provides at least some
 
00:50:33.770 --> 00:50:33.780 align:start position:0%
significant money for something outside
 
00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:36.660 align:start position:0%
of paying for the Liquor Commission to
 
00:50:37.730 --> 00:50:37.740 align:start position:0%
do this
 
00:50:42.589 --> 00:50:42.599 align:start position:0%
and eight percent at wholesale level I
 
00:50:45.170 --> 00:50:45.180 align:start position:0%
don't think does more than pay for the
 
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission to do it once they've
 
00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:52.670 --> 00:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
okay other hands up here before we take
 
00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
the straw poll and because we got other
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
amendments guys representative
 
00:51:00.410 --> 00:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just follow up on
 
00:51:02.870 --> 00:51:02.880 align:start position:0%
your swept text
 
00:51:06.109 --> 00:51:06.119 align:start position:0%
um can't use props on the floor but we
 
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
can here
 
00:51:11.210 --> 00:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
360 three million dollars
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
if I take
 
00:51:15.230 --> 00:51:15.240 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars
 
00:51:17.930 --> 00:51:17.940 align:start position:0%
put it in here as well
 
00:51:21.410 --> 00:51:21.420 align:start position:0%
then that overflows this and that that
 
00:51:25.069 --> 00:51:25.079 align:start position:0%
overflow goes back to the taxpayer it's
 
00:51:25.079 --> 00:51:26.530 align:start position:0%
overflow goes back to the taxpayer it's
still

00:51:26.530 --> 00:51:26.540 align:start position:0%
still
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
363 million dollars if it's 20
 
00:51:34.190 --> 00:51:34.200 align:start position:0%
in then 20 out
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
going back to the taxpayer so there's no
 
00:51:42.410 --> 00:51:42.420 align:start position:0%
reduction it's still 363 million dollars
 
00:51:45.349 --> 00:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
so there's no reduction
 
00:51:47.450 --> 00:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
one can only hope that that's only water
 
00:51:49.490 --> 00:51:49.500 align:start position:0%
in that vessel that you just handed up
 
00:51:52.069 --> 00:51:52.079 align:start position:0%
okay moving around representative did
 
00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%
you have representative Leon yes thank
 
00:51:55.970 --> 00:51:55.980 align:start position:0%
you very much um I I think that
 
00:51:57.410 --> 00:51:57.420 align:start position:0%
representative Almy brought up a good
 
00:51:59.990 --> 00:52:00.000 align:start position:0%
point about some cross-border travel
 
00:52:01.790 --> 00:52:01.800 align:start position:0%
that's happening now
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
um the Massachusetts cannabis Control
 
00:52:05.870 --> 00:52:05.880 align:start position:0%
Commission reported about 1.5 billion
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
dollars in sales last year and our most
 
00:52:11.210 --> 00:52:11.220 align:start position:0%
populous areas are on the border of
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts with our more populated
 
00:52:15.710 --> 00:52:15.720 align:start position:0%
areas having easier travel into
 
00:52:17.930 --> 00:52:17.940 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so I don't think that we
 
00:52:19.609 --> 00:52:19.619 align:start position:0%
can put a number on this but I don't
 
00:52:22.069 --> 00:52:22.079 align:start position:0%
think that that 1.5 billion dollars in
 
00:52:24.290 --> 00:52:24.300 align:start position:0%
sales should be ignored
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
representative fellow sorry it took us
 
00:52:27.890 --> 00:52:27.900 align:start position:0%
so long to get back around to you
 
00:52:29.690 --> 00:52:29.700 align:start position:0%
um yeah because
 
00:52:31.910 --> 00:52:31.920 align:start position:0%
well I would like to get to the straw
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
voting on all things other than where to
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
tax and how to tax in the amount of
 
00:52:39.059 --> 00:52:39.910 align:start position:0%
tax and how to tax in the amount of
money

00:52:39.910 --> 00:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
money
 
00:52:43.549 --> 00:52:43.559 align:start position:0%
I'm very good with the rest of the
 
00:52:45.290 --> 00:52:45.300 align:start position:0%
amendment that that representative
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
spilsbury has and I also want to say
 
00:52:51.530 --> 00:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
that how he described what happens with
 
00:52:55.309 --> 00:52:55.319 align:start position:0%
the swept tax is accurate I worked at
 
00:52:57.470 --> 00:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education for 30 years
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
all of the time involved with that
 
00:53:04.309 --> 00:53:04.319 align:start position:0%
formula and while you know whatever
 
00:53:06.890 --> 00:53:06.900 align:start position:0%
amount amount when we go back to the
 
00:53:09.890 --> 00:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
words that were in the original Bill to
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
describe the swept what happens is
 
00:53:16.069 --> 00:53:16.079 align:start position:0%
similar to to what happened last year
 
00:53:20.390 --> 00:53:20.400 align:start position:0%
when the swept tax was cut from 363 down
 
00:53:25.010 --> 00:53:25.020 align:start position:0%
to 263. you may not have noticed it when
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
you looked at your whole tax
 
00:53:32.030 --> 00:53:32.040 align:start position:0%
Bill property tax bill but it did indeed
 
00:53:36.349 --> 00:53:36.359 align:start position:0%
reduce the amount of money that
 
00:53:38.809 --> 00:53:38.819 align:start position:0%
people had to pay on their property tax
 
00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
for schools by
 
00:53:44.750 --> 00:53:44.760 align:start position:0%
not not exactly 100 million but probably
 
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
80 million and I won't go into the
 
00:53:49.549 --> 00:53:49.559 align:start position:0%
difference between the two but it does
 
00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:52.500 align:start position:0%
indeed reduce what is on the property
 
00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:53.720 align:start position:0%
tax bill
 
00:53:56.450 --> 00:53:56.460 align:start position:0%
thank you very much okay what I'd like
 
00:53:58.849 --> 00:53:58.859 align:start position:0%
to do is just take some straw polls here
 
00:54:01.370 --> 00:54:01.380 align:start position:0%
we will as recommended oh go ahead
 
00:54:03.109 --> 00:54:03.119 align:start position:0%
representative I just want to clarify
 
00:54:04.730 --> 00:54:04.740 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that we're we're
 
00:54:07.250 --> 00:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
bracketing the tax rates are we
 
00:54:09.349 --> 00:54:09.359 align:start position:0%
bracketing where the tax Falls because I
 
00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:10.740 align:start position:0%
think some of us are still trying to
 
00:54:14.089 --> 00:54:14.099 align:start position:0%
figure out between retail and
 
00:54:17.329 --> 00:54:17.339 align:start position:0%
wholesale uh well the amendment before
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
us is not on retail it is on the final
 
00:54:25.490 --> 00:54:25.500 align:start position:0%
form so at the wholesale level am I
 
00:54:27.530 --> 00:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
correct with that yes so this so this
 
00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:30.960 align:start position:0%
amendment which we are about to vote on
 
00:54:35.630 --> 00:54:35.640 align:start position:0%
um bracketing off the tax rate is on
 
00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:38.220 align:start position:0%
it's an excise tax effectively not a
 
00:54:40.790 --> 00:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
retail tax representative I would point
 
00:54:42.829 --> 00:54:42.839 align:start position:0%
out that a lot of the policy has already
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
been decided on the house floor
 
00:54:48.470 --> 00:54:48.480 align:start position:0%
and to try to change it now to a retail
 
00:54:50.750 --> 00:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
sales tax isn't going to fly that's a
 
00:54:52.630 --> 00:54:52.640 align:start position:0%
policy change
 
00:54:55.970 --> 00:54:55.980 align:start position:0%
but what we did with an excise tax we
 
00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
didn't really change policy even though
 
00:54:59.569 --> 00:54:59.579 align:start position:0%
it was sold as wholesale the word again
 
00:55:02.089 --> 00:55:02.099 align:start position:0%
it said referred to manufacturers as
 
00:55:06.170 --> 00:55:06.180 align:start position:0%
well so it was it was clear we didn't
 
00:55:06.180 --> 00:55:07.670 align:start position:0%
well so it was it was clear we didn't
okay

00:55:07.670 --> 00:55:07.680 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:11.450 --> 00:55:11.460 align:start position:0%
so Mr clerk help me help me count
 
00:55:13.490 --> 00:55:13.500 align:start position:0%
because I can't see everyone very well
 
00:55:16.430 --> 00:55:16.440 align:start position:0%
so Madam chair yes
 
00:55:19.210 --> 00:55:19.220 align:start position:0%
um can we please vote on everything
 
00:55:23.089 --> 00:55:23.099 align:start position:0%
except related to where where the tax
 
00:55:26.329 --> 00:55:26.339 align:start position:0%
Falls and the rate of that tax
 
00:55:29.089 --> 00:55:29.099 align:start position:0%
and just get all those other issues off
 
00:55:31.690 --> 00:55:31.700 align:start position:0%
the table because I have an amendment
 
00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:35.760 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to propose that that moves
 
00:55:38.930 --> 00:55:38.940 align:start position:0%
moves it farther up the chain
 
00:55:41.569 --> 00:55:41.579 align:start position:0%
for the level of Taxation
 
00:55:43.130 --> 00:55:43.140 align:start position:0%
um well let's see where we are with this
 
00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
because this is what we have before us
 
00:55:46.010 --> 00:55:46.020 align:start position:0%
and then I don't even know how many
 
00:55:47.569 --> 00:55:47.579 align:start position:0%
amendments there are out there and we
 
00:55:49.730 --> 00:55:49.740 align:start position:0%
can we can see where we are on that as
 
00:55:52.609 --> 00:55:52.619 align:start position:0%
well representative already
 
00:55:55.309 --> 00:55:55.319 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder regarding policy and
 
00:55:55.319 --> 00:55:56.510 align:start position:0%
just as a reminder regarding policy and
procedure

00:55:56.510 --> 00:55:56.520 align:start position:0%
procedure
 
00:55:58.849 --> 00:55:58.859 align:start position:0%
if we come up with an amendment and then
 
00:56:01.130 --> 00:56:01.140 align:start position:0%
we come up with another amendment the
 
00:56:02.630 --> 00:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment modifies the First
 
00:56:05.210 --> 00:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
Amendment so you can keep changing
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
things Bit by Bit by Bit by Bit until
 
00:56:10.370 --> 00:56:10.380 align:start position:0%
you get what you want
 
00:56:13.309 --> 00:56:13.319 align:start position:0%
yes and if we end up with you know at
 
00:56:14.690 --> 00:56:14.700 align:start position:0%
the end of today before three o'clock
 
00:56:16.849 --> 00:56:16.859 align:start position:0%
hopefully um if we end up with three
 
00:56:18.470 --> 00:56:18.480 align:start position:0%
different amendments that pass this
 
00:56:20.030 --> 00:56:20.040 align:start position:0%
committee then they'll all be merged
 
00:56:24.349 --> 00:56:24.359 align:start position:0%
together into one I do understand that
 
00:56:28.370 --> 00:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
but I would like to
 
00:56:31.809 --> 00:56:31.819 align:start position:0%
have a discussion of that will impact
 
00:56:35.690 --> 00:56:35.700 align:start position:0%
how much money we raise from the from
 
00:56:37.190 --> 00:56:37.200 align:start position:0%
the taxation
 
00:56:41.510 --> 00:56:41.520 align:start position:0%
which can legitimately be placed either
 
00:56:44.750 --> 00:56:44.760 align:start position:0%
at the wholesale level or a higher level
 
00:56:46.910 --> 00:56:46.920 align:start position:0%
I'd like to have that I just like to get
 
00:56:48.890 --> 00:56:48.900 align:start position:0%
everything else off the table so we can
 
00:56:51.049 --> 00:56:51.059 align:start position:0%
discuss just that
 
00:56:53.569 --> 00:56:53.579 align:start position:0%
representative balmy
 
00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
yes I think if we do as of some fellows
 
00:57:02.930 --> 00:57:02.940 align:start position:0%
says and vote separately on the tax rate
 
00:57:04.790 --> 00:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
and location
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
from the rest of the amendment that we
 
00:57:10.849 --> 00:57:10.859 align:start position:0%
can at least clear out the rest of the
 
00:57:14.210 --> 00:57:14.220 align:start position:0%
Amendments policy from the other debate
 
00:57:16.609 --> 00:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
because otherwise you'll have a lot of
 
00:57:18.950 --> 00:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
us voting against the rest of that
 
00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:22.010 align:start position:0%
us voting against the rest of that
policy

00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:24.770 --> 00:57:24.780 align:start position:0%
okay so we will do three straw poll
 
00:57:27.950 --> 00:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
votes on what I have as Amendment 1182
 
00:57:29.690 --> 00:57:29.700 align:start position:0%
is that the amendment number we're
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:34.990 --> 00:57:35.000 align:start position:0%
I guess so
 
00:57:39.049 --> 00:57:39.059 align:start position:0%
it's actually 1201 that we are dealing
 
00:57:41.809 --> 00:57:41.819 align:start position:0%
with but so far as I can tell 1182 looks
 
00:57:44.030 --> 00:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
identical okay so there's three
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
different straw poll votes the first one
 
00:57:45.839 --> 00:57:47.150 align:start position:0%
different straw poll votes the first one
is

00:57:47.150 --> 00:57:47.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:57:50.569 --> 00:57:50.579 align:start position:0%
the amendment as produced with all of
 
00:57:52.190 --> 00:57:52.200 align:start position:0%
the corrections that representative
 
00:57:55.609 --> 00:57:55.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.250 --> 00:57:58.260 align:start position:0%
not including the tax rate
 
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
or where the tax is imposed upon all
 
00:58:13.329 --> 00:58:13.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:17.530 --> 00:58:17.540 align:start position:0%
I can't see what it's economics
 
00:58:19.970 --> 00:58:19.980 align:start position:0%
how many how many people is that though
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
please then it's 20. okay 19. oh
 
00:58:30.609 --> 00:58:30.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.569 --> 00:58:32.579 align:start position:0%
well that's why I need you to see it
 
00:58:32.579 --> 00:58:34.010 align:start position:0%
well that's why I need you to see it
okay

00:58:34.010 --> 00:58:34.020 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:44.030 --> 00:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:47.870 --> 00:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
okay second part would be on the tax
 
00:58:47.880 --> 00:58:49.190 align:start position:0%
okay second part would be on the tax
rate

00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
rate
 
00:58:52.250 --> 00:58:52.260 align:start position:0%
right now in this amendment what is uh
 
00:58:55.730 --> 00:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
entertained is an eight percent rate all
 
00:58:57.410 --> 00:58:57.420 align:start position:0%
those in favor of the eight percent
 
00:59:00.770 --> 00:59:00.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:07.490 --> 00:59:07.500 align:start position:0%
nine one two three
 
00:59:10.730 --> 00:59:10.740 align:start position:0%
oh God
 
00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:13.309 align:start position:0%
oh God
um

00:59:13.309 --> 00:59:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.030 --> 00:59:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
ten

00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
ten
 
00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay so how many people do we have in
 
00:59:30.650 --> 00:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:33.289 --> 00:59:33.299 align:start position:0%

so Tyler post but we had nine that were
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%

01:00:00.190 --> 01:00:00.200 align:start position:0%
four okay okay all of those uh in favor
 
01:00:02.870 --> 01:00:02.880 align:start position:0%
of the eight percent that is in this
 
01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:05.170 align:start position:0%
of the eight percent that is in this
amendment

01:00:05.170 --> 01:00:05.180 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
01:00:08.750 --> 01:00:08.760 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight nine
 
01:00:08.760 --> 01:00:18.370 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight nine
yeah

01:00:18.370 --> 01:00:18.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:22.549 --> 01:00:22.559 align:start position:0%
okay all right and now the third element
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
of this amendment is
 
01:00:28.250 --> 01:00:28.260 align:start position:0%
what was discussed what would the seem
 
01:00:30.950 --> 01:00:30.960 align:start position:0%
to be is this part of this amendment is
 
01:00:33.650 --> 01:00:33.660 align:start position:0%
to keep the tax at the excise or
 
01:00:35.510 --> 01:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
wholesale level
 
01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
with some clarifications on the right
 
01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:39.349 align:start position:0%
with some clarifications on the right
wording

01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
wording
 
01:00:42.289 --> 01:00:42.299 align:start position:0%
representative fellows just my
 
01:00:44.510 --> 01:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
understanding is that an excise tax can
 
01:00:46.370 --> 01:00:46.380 align:start position:0%
be at any level so I think that's right
 
01:00:49.849 --> 01:00:49.859 align:start position:0%
I I think the question is your question
 
01:00:52.970 --> 01:00:52.980 align:start position:0%
would want to be do you want to keep it
 
01:00:54.470 --> 01:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
at the wholesale level is that what
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
you're asking yes sir okay so all those
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
in favor of keeping it at the wholesale
 
01:01:07.930 --> 01:01:07.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:10.609 --> 01:01:10.619 align:start position:0%
all those opposed to the wholesale level
 
01:01:10.619 --> 01:01:18.109 align:start position:0%
all those opposed to the wholesale level
taxation

01:01:18.109 --> 01:01:18.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:21.720 align:start position:0%
six seven eight nine ten
 
01:01:25.010 --> 01:01:25.020 align:start position:0%
okay Madam chair question yes
 
01:01:26.870 --> 01:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
representative is wholesale level
 
01:01:29.809 --> 01:01:29.819 align:start position:0%
considered final form I just want to
 
01:01:31.670 --> 01:01:31.680 align:start position:0%
make sure that confusion I'm I'm
 
01:01:35.030 --> 01:01:35.040 align:start position:0%
confused on that one I or let me say I'm
 
01:01:36.589 --> 01:01:36.599 align:start position:0%
just looking for clarification is
 
01:01:39.730 --> 01:01:39.740 align:start position:0%
wholesale level considered final form
 
01:01:42.410 --> 01:01:42.420 align:start position:0%
what is exactly stated in this amendment
 
01:01:44.329 --> 01:01:44.339 align:start position:0%
I'm using the word wholesale because
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
it's clearer than
 
01:01:49.549 --> 01:01:49.559 align:start position:0%
because it's not necessarily at the
 
01:01:52.670 --> 01:01:52.680 align:start position:0%
farmer level right it could be at the
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
producer level does that make sense
 
01:01:56.210 --> 01:01:56.220 align:start position:0%
that's what we clarified here at the
 
01:01:59.270 --> 01:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
final form am I right good okay exactly
 
01:02:02.329 --> 01:02:02.339 align:start position:0%
okay so now we know that we don't have
 
01:02:06.170 --> 01:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
consensus on the tax rate or where the
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
rate is imposed
 
01:02:11.270 --> 01:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
representative Platt Madam chair I
 
01:02:13.789 --> 01:02:13.799 align:start position:0%
suppose I suggest we
 
01:02:16.010 --> 01:02:16.020 align:start position:0%
discuss where it's imposed first because
 
01:02:23.809 --> 01:02:23.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:26.569 --> 01:02:26.579 align:start position:0%
I said I suggest we talk about where
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
it's imposed first because whatever that
 
01:02:32.809 --> 01:02:32.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:34.609 --> 01:02:34.619 align:start position:0%
Madam chair you
 
01:02:37.010 --> 01:02:37.020 align:start position:0%
um I have an amendment okay that puts it
 
01:02:39.470 --> 01:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
at a different level
 
01:03:11.809 --> 01:03:11.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:11.819 --> 01:03:17.750 align:start position:0%
 
mm-hmm

01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:39.289 --> 01:03:39.299 align:start position:0%
okay everyone has it now so can you just
 
01:03:40.730 --> 01:03:40.740 align:start position:0%
describe what this does
 
01:03:43.910 --> 01:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
okay no one has it so we all know about
 
01:03:45.890 --> 01:03:45.900 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire advantage
 
01:03:49.490 --> 01:03:49.500 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to see a sales tax
 
01:03:52.609 --> 01:03:52.619 align:start position:0%
and a sales tax is something that you
 
01:03:55.970 --> 01:03:55.980 align:start position:0%
see if you're a customer on the receipt
 
01:03:59.930 --> 01:03:59.940 align:start position:0%
so what I've proposed here is it a tax
 
01:04:02.210 --> 01:04:02.220 align:start position:0%
on the product when it's farther up the
 
01:04:06.589 --> 01:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
chain so it has a higher value but it's
 
01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:09.720 align:start position:0%
not imposed on the customer
 
01:04:15.230 --> 01:04:15.240 align:start position:0%
and what it's called is a gross receipt
 
01:04:17.329 --> 01:04:17.339 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a tax
 
01:04:20.170 --> 01:04:20.180 align:start position:0%
paid by the
 
01:04:23.750 --> 01:04:23.760 align:start position:0%
the company that owns the retail
 
01:04:27.109 --> 01:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
establishment and it would be a tax on
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
the gross receipts of the sale of only
 
01:04:33.289 --> 01:04:33.299 align:start position:0%
those products that contain
 
01:04:37.250 --> 01:04:37.260 align:start position:0%
cannabis and and the rate I put in here
 
01:04:40.010 --> 01:04:40.020 align:start position:0%
is 15 but we can talk about that next
 
01:04:42.170 --> 01:04:42.180 align:start position:0%
so this is
 
01:04:45.530 --> 01:04:45.540 align:start position:0%
um it's not a completely unique idea I
 
01:04:49.789 --> 01:04:49.799 align:start position:0%
actually found this in New Mexico's
 
01:04:54.170 --> 01:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
um process for taxing cannabis they I
 
01:04:55.309 --> 01:04:55.319 align:start position:0%
think they
 
01:04:58.010 --> 01:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
I can't remember the details of that but
 
01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:00.660 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's not um something that I
 
01:05:03.049 --> 01:05:03.059 align:start position:0%
just made up other states use attacks
 
01:05:07.190 --> 01:05:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:09.780 align:start position:0%
so maybe we just talk about that concept
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
okay let's real quick talk about that
 
01:05:13.609 --> 01:05:13.619 align:start position:0%
concept and then we'll go to straw Provo
 
01:05:14.870 --> 01:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
just to see where we're at so we're just
 
01:05:16.250 --> 01:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
going to keep drilling down okay yes
 
01:05:18.410 --> 01:05:18.420 align:start position:0%
representative if it's at the retail
 
01:05:20.750 --> 01:05:20.760 align:start position:0%
level it's a sales tax even if it's paid
 
01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:23.040 align:start position:0%
for by the retailers it is not a sales
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
tax and I just told you a sales tax
 
01:05:28.130 --> 01:05:28.140 align:start position:0%
shows up on the receipt for the customer
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:34.490 --> 01:05:34.500 align:start position:0%
representative Spielberg
 
01:05:36.770 --> 01:05:36.780 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:39.890 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:39.900 --> 01:05:41.630 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:05:41.630 --> 01:05:41.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:05:44.870 --> 01:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a fair distinction a
 
01:05:49.250 --> 01:05:49.260 align:start position:0%
retail tax is tacked on top of a a sales
 
01:05:52.130 --> 01:05:52.140 align:start position:0%
tax is tacked on top of a retail price
 
01:05:54.770 --> 01:05:54.780 align:start position:0%
and excise tax is embedded into the
 
01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:55.730 align:start position:0%
and excise tax is embedded into the
price

01:05:55.730 --> 01:05:55.740 align:start position:0%
price
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
excise taxes are generally charged at
 
01:06:01.690 --> 01:06:01.700 align:start position:0%
the wholesale level they can be either
 
01:06:04.730 --> 01:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
so you know I don't want to get caught
 
01:06:05.930 --> 01:06:05.940 align:start position:0%
up in those semantics I think
 
01:06:07.309 --> 01:06:07.319 align:start position:0%
representative fellows is essentially
 
01:06:07.319 --> 01:06:09.309 align:start position:0%
representative fellows is essentially
correct

01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:06:12.710 --> 01:06:12.720 align:start position:0%
but my argument for
 
01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:15.480 align:start position:0%
doing this at the wholesale level
 
01:06:17.690 --> 01:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
would be number one I want it to be an
 
01:06:19.609 --> 01:06:19.619 align:start position:0%
excise tax so that it's invisible to the
 
01:06:21.170 --> 01:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
customer it's embedded in the price and
 
01:06:23.569 --> 01:06:23.579 align:start position:0%
I think we agree on that
 
01:06:25.430 --> 01:06:25.440 align:start position:0%
and second
 
01:06:27.950 --> 01:06:27.960 align:start position:0%
what we're doing here is we're
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
legalizing something that has been
 
01:06:32.210 --> 01:06:32.220 align:start position:0%
historically illegal
 
01:06:34.670 --> 01:06:34.680 align:start position:0%
we're allowing something that in many
 
01:06:38.569 --> 01:06:38.579 align:start position:0%
circles is still objected to
 
01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:40.799 align:start position:0%
we're taking something that has been out
 
01:06:41.930 --> 01:06:41.940 align:start position:0%
of favor
 
01:06:46.130 --> 01:06:46.140 align:start position:0%
and we're allowing it to be in favor in
 
01:06:48.109 --> 01:06:48.119 align:start position:0%
fact we're capitalizing on it the state
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
is actually planning to generate revenue
 
01:06:54.049 --> 01:06:54.059 align:start position:0%
and that's the essence of our discussion
 
01:06:56.829 --> 01:06:56.839 align:start position:0%
I would be happier
 
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
taxing the Cannabis in its final form
 
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
before a retailer marks it up I don't
 
01:07:06.410 --> 01:07:06.420 align:start position:0%
think that the state
 
01:07:08.809 --> 01:07:08.819 align:start position:0%
should take a stake
 
01:07:12.289 --> 01:07:12.299 align:start position:0%
in how much the markup is
 
01:07:15.470 --> 01:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
I think as we heard in testimony last
 
01:07:18.049 --> 01:07:18.059 align:start position:0%
Tuesday markups can be all over the
 
01:07:19.670 --> 01:07:19.680 align:start position:0%
place they can be different radically
 
01:07:21.890 --> 01:07:21.900 align:start position:0%
different for one form of the product
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
relative to another
 
01:07:25.910 --> 01:07:25.920 align:start position:0%
or one store relative to another one
 
01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:27.829 align:start position:0%
or one store relative to another one
Outlet

01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
Outlet
 
01:07:30.650 --> 01:07:30.660 align:start position:0%
and one chain of just channel of
 
01:07:32.870 --> 01:07:32.880 align:start position:0%
distribution from another
 
01:07:36.650 --> 01:07:36.660 align:start position:0%
let's leave the amount of the markup
 
01:07:39.170 --> 01:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
to the competitive Dynamics
 
01:07:42.529 --> 01:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
let people compete and it's probably in
 
01:07:44.089 --> 01:07:44.099 align:start position:0%
the interests of everybody that they
 
01:07:47.569 --> 01:07:47.579 align:start position:0%
compete sharply and I I I simply do not
 
01:07:51.470 --> 01:07:51.480 align:start position:0%
see any realistic possibility in a
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%
competitive Open Marketplace which is
 
01:07:55.910 --> 01:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
what we have not had
 
01:07:57.529 --> 01:07:57.539 align:start position:0%
but we're creating
 
01:08:01.910 --> 01:08:01.920 align:start position:0%
of a 300 or 400 percent retail markup I
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
don't even want the state to be in that
 
01:08:07.010 --> 01:08:07.020 align:start position:0%
game I want to Simply tax it
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
before the retailers compete
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet it's a couple of
 
01:08:17.450 --> 01:08:17.460 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury said
 
01:08:20.209 --> 01:08:20.219 align:start position:0%
in effect in simpler form
 
01:08:22.249 --> 01:08:22.259 align:start position:0%
there may be a time and there may be a
 
01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:24.660 align:start position:0%
market for say people that want to have
 
01:08:27.229 --> 01:08:27.239 align:start position:0%
a cannabis infused wedding cake for
 
01:08:29.030 --> 01:08:29.040 align:start position:0%
instance okay
 
01:08:32.930 --> 01:08:32.940 align:start position:0%
and if it gets a sales tax a retail
 
01:08:34.430 --> 01:08:34.440 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
01:08:34.440 --> 01:08:35.990 align:start position:0%
sales tax
that

01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:08:38.209 --> 01:08:38.219 align:start position:0%
conservatively speaking thousand dollar
 
01:08:41.090 --> 01:08:41.100 align:start position:0%
wedding cake with ten dollars twenty
 
01:08:42.769 --> 01:08:42.779 align:start position:0%
five dollars worth of cannabis product
 
01:08:45.789 --> 01:08:45.799 align:start position:0%
it's taxed at a thousand dollars
 
01:08:49.789 --> 01:08:49.799 align:start position:0%
it makes far more sense to tax it at the
 
01:08:52.729 --> 01:08:52.739 align:start position:0%
wholesale level than to put this on the
 
01:08:54.950 --> 01:08:54.960 align:start position:0%
retail buyer because they will pay for
 
01:08:58.490 --> 01:08:58.500 align:start position:0%
it they will pay for it
 
01:08:59.990 --> 01:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
okay I'm going to keep going around this
 
01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:01.380 align:start position:0%
side then we'll come around and then
 
01:09:04.550 --> 01:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
we'll do our vote representative leapley
 
01:09:05.870 --> 01:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:09:08.570 --> 01:09:08.580 align:start position:0%
um this committee has been provided with
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
a number of different
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
uh lists of what other states do and
 
01:09:19.130 --> 01:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
where the tax is imposed
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
and there are a number of other states
 
01:09:25.610 --> 01:09:25.620 align:start position:0%
that impose excise taxes and these other
 
01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
states also are states that just
 
01:09:32.809 --> 01:09:32.819 align:start position:0%
have sales taxes right so every example
 
01:09:35.510 --> 01:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
I can find
 
01:09:35.520 --> 01:09:37.070 align:start position:0%
I can find
um

01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:39.289 --> 01:09:39.299 align:start position:0%
every other state
 
01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
and the reason that I'm considering what
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
other states do is because we don't have
 
01:09:44.769 --> 01:09:44.779 align:start position:0%
any information
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
on Revenue generation in this state
 
01:09:50.769 --> 01:09:50.779 align:start position:0%
right so it's it's easier to look around
 
01:09:53.990 --> 01:09:54.000 align:start position:0%
there are a number of excise taxes they
 
01:09:57.410 --> 01:09:57.420 align:start position:0%
are paid by the retailer on gross
 
01:09:57.420 --> 01:09:58.630 align:start position:0%
are paid by the retailer on gross
receipts

01:09:58.630 --> 01:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
receipts
 
01:10:02.810 --> 01:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
some states also impose taxes on the
 
01:10:06.709 --> 01:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
cultivator or on the manufacturer but
 
01:10:11.150 --> 01:10:11.160 align:start position:0%
the the way that I see it we can tax
 
01:10:14.689 --> 01:10:14.699 align:start position:0%
this product at a lower level than any
 
01:10:16.850 --> 01:10:16.860 align:start position:0%
other state in the Union
 
01:10:21.890 --> 01:10:21.900 align:start position:0%
and do that on gross receipts which
 
01:10:24.410 --> 01:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
would be paid by the retailer
 
01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:26.270 align:start position:0%
would be paid by the retailer
um

01:10:26.270 --> 01:10:26.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:28.610 --> 01:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
and still undercut every other state
 
01:10:31.330 --> 01:10:31.340 align:start position:0%
without shooting ourselves in the foot
 
01:10:34.070 --> 01:10:34.080 align:start position:0%
and wondering if we're even going to
 
01:10:37.490 --> 01:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
cover our costs so I'm not sure where
 
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
the advantage is I see that there is an
 
01:10:42.370 --> 01:10:42.380 align:start position:0%
advantage the New Hampshire advantage
 
01:10:45.890 --> 01:10:45.900 align:start position:0%
of taxing lower we do this with
 
01:10:48.410 --> 01:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
cigarettes we do this with alcohol and
 
01:10:51.350 --> 01:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
we see real advantages for our citizens
 
01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
so I guess I'm confused on where the
 
01:10:58.910 --> 01:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
eight percent comes from and why we're
 
01:11:00.830 --> 01:11:00.840 align:start position:0%
choosing to impose it on the wholesale
 
01:11:04.729 --> 01:11:04.739 align:start position:0%
because it feels like we're on purpose
 
01:11:07.370 --> 01:11:07.380 align:start position:0%
not just foregoing some Revenue which I
 
01:11:10.250 --> 01:11:10.260 align:start position:0%
think we're all fine charging a lower
 
01:11:13.189 --> 01:11:13.199 align:start position:0%
tax rate than anybody else who is next
 
01:11:15.590 --> 01:11:15.600 align:start position:0%
to us I think where you lose some of us
 
01:11:20.570 --> 01:11:20.580 align:start position:0%
is we don't understand why it's so
 
01:11:23.270 --> 01:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
out of whack with everybody else's
 
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
approach to taxing this product and
 
01:11:28.430 --> 01:11:28.440 align:start position:0%
there is a cost to society just as there
 
01:11:31.970 --> 01:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
is with cigarettes and alcohol and it
 
01:11:36.110 --> 01:11:36.120 align:start position:0%
worries me that we are willing to forego
 
01:11:38.050 --> 01:11:38.060 align:start position:0%
so much revenue
 
01:11:41.149 --> 01:11:41.159 align:start position:0%
I would agree with attacks that would
 
01:11:41.159 --> 01:11:42.530 align:start position:0%
I would agree with attacks that would
undercut

01:11:42.530 --> 01:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
undercut
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
all of our neighbors but would be at
 
01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:47.280 align:start position:0%
least on a realm where we can compare
 
01:11:49.910 --> 01:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
which because every other state has a
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
retail tax or a retail gross receipts
 
01:11:54.830 --> 01:11:54.840 align:start position:0%
tax we could at least compare oranges
 
01:11:58.810 --> 01:11:58.820 align:start position:0%
and oranges so I'm in favor of a low tax
 
01:12:02.630 --> 01:12:02.640 align:start position:0%
I'm in favor of having a tax that's
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
lower than all of our neighbors I just
 
01:12:07.910 --> 01:12:07.920 align:start position:0%
would like to be on the same chalkboard
 
01:12:10.490 --> 01:12:10.500 align:start position:0%
as we discussed this thank you
 
01:12:15.290 --> 01:12:15.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:15.300 --> 01:12:16.550 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:12:16.550 --> 01:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:12:18.890 --> 01:12:18.900 align:start position:0%
um one of the thank you madam chair
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
we're looking to tax somewhere and the
 
01:12:27.050 --> 01:12:27.060 align:start position:0%
question is are we in effect
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
are we taxing the consumer or are we in
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
effect looking to impose another
 
01:12:35.149 --> 01:12:35.159 align:start position:0%
business tax
 
01:12:37.430 --> 01:12:37.440 align:start position:0%
because if we tax at the excise level
 
01:12:42.290 --> 01:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:44.270 --> 01:12:44.280 align:start position:0%
we've got a reputation as a business
 
01:12:46.130 --> 01:12:46.140 align:start position:0%
friendly state
 
01:12:51.229 --> 01:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
which way we want to who we want to
 
01:12:58.450 --> 01:12:58.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:01.550 --> 01:13:01.560 align:start position:0%
one I'm not proposing this but if we
 
01:13:03.649 --> 01:13:03.659 align:start position:0%
want to make sure not to try to spread
 
01:13:06.050 --> 01:13:06.060 align:start position:0%
the annoyance around we can do some on
 
01:13:07.070 --> 01:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
each level
 
01:13:09.709 --> 01:13:09.719 align:start position:0%
I am not proposing this
 
01:13:09.719 --> 01:13:11.450 align:start position:0%
I am not proposing this
but

01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
putting the tax on a wholesaler is a
 
01:13:17.750 --> 01:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
business tax
 
01:13:19.970 --> 01:13:19.980 align:start position:0%
and we should just be aware that that's
 
01:13:22.370 --> 01:13:22.380 align:start position:0%
what it means
 
01:13:24.950 --> 01:13:24.960 align:start position:0%
representative Orr thank you madam chair
 
01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.689 align:start position:0%
representative Orr thank you madam chair
so

01:13:26.689 --> 01:13:26.699 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
I would like to see I'd rather see the
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
tax at one percent I mean if we want to
 
01:13:33.530 --> 01:13:33.540 align:start position:0%
dry up the black market
 
01:13:35.930 --> 01:13:35.940 align:start position:0%
that's the goal as far as I'm concerned
 
01:13:38.030 --> 01:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
drop the black market you take cannabis
 
01:13:41.750 --> 01:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
out the hands of children and others
 
01:13:43.729 --> 01:13:43.739 align:start position:0%
that can only get it through the black
 
01:13:47.030 --> 01:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
market I don't care if the cost to the
 
01:13:49.550 --> 01:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
state is x amount of dollars for this
 
01:13:51.350 --> 01:13:51.360 align:start position:0%
commission or that commission or this
 
01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:53.400 align:start position:0%
fee or that fee
 
01:13:57.770 --> 01:13:57.780 align:start position:0%
my only reason I would support this at
 
01:14:01.189 --> 01:14:01.199 align:start position:0%
all because of the societal impacts is
 
01:14:03.830 --> 01:14:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we dry up the black market I don't
 
01:14:05.750 --> 01:14:05.760 align:start position:0%
care what the revenues are to the state
 
01:14:07.250 --> 01:14:07.260 align:start position:0%
I don't care if it's a million dollars
 
01:14:09.649 --> 01:14:09.659 align:start position:0%
10 million 100 million 200 million a
 
01:14:12.770 --> 01:14:12.780 align:start position:0%
billion or one dollar if we dry up the
 
01:14:16.010 --> 01:14:16.020 align:start position:0%
black market and help our youth and help
 
01:14:17.450 --> 01:14:17.460 align:start position:0%
our society
 
01:14:20.810 --> 01:14:20.820 align:start position:0%
and take away the impacts that cannabis
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
is going to put on our society just like
 
01:14:25.130 --> 01:14:25.140 align:start position:0%
alcohol and driving and talk while
 
01:14:27.770 --> 01:14:27.780 align:start position:0%
intoxicated that's what I'm concerned
 
01:14:29.870 --> 01:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
about I'd rather see the tax at one
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
percent so we compete out compete all of
 
01:14:35.689 --> 01:14:35.699 align:start position:0%
our neighbors and dry up the black
 
01:14:38.209 --> 01:14:38.219 align:start position:0%
market on every side of our borders and
 
01:14:38.219 --> 01:14:39.470 align:start position:0%
market on every side of our borders and
within

01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
within
 
01:14:40.970 --> 01:14:40.980 align:start position:0%
okay going to this side of the room
 
01:14:43.010 --> 01:14:43.020 align:start position:0%
going around going around representative
 
01:14:45.229 --> 01:14:45.239 align:start position:0%
wrong I'm sorry
 
01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:47.760 align:start position:0%
uh to that point I just want to remind
 
01:14:51.590 --> 01:14:51.600 align:start position:0%
you that the lower we tax the retailers
 
01:14:54.470 --> 01:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
are still going to price the product at
 
01:14:58.189 --> 01:14:58.199 align:start position:0%
what as a competitive level so it the
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
question is
 
01:15:01.550 --> 01:15:01.560 align:start position:0%
um do we want to take more of that
 
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
profit and tax revenue and leave them
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
with less or give them more in tax more
 
01:15:08.750 --> 01:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the profit that's really what the
 
01:15:10.310 --> 01:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
question is because
 
01:15:12.470 --> 01:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
they're going to price it at the same
 
01:15:14.630 --> 01:15:14.640 align:start position:0%
amount whether we tax them at one
 
01:15:16.970 --> 01:15:16.980 align:start position:0%
percent or eight percent they're gonna
 
01:15:19.070 --> 01:15:19.080 align:start position:0%
they're gonna their price is gonna be
 
01:15:21.470 --> 01:15:21.480 align:start position:0%
driven by what the market is can can
 
01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:24.300 align:start position:0%
absorb so I just think we have to
 
01:15:26.750 --> 01:15:26.760 align:start position:0%
realize that just because we may go to a
 
01:15:28.610 --> 01:15:28.620 align:start position:0%
lower tax doesn't mean the final price
 
01:15:31.310 --> 01:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
to the customer is going to be lower it
 
01:15:32.990 --> 01:15:33.000 align:start position:0%
very well could be at what we would
 
01:15:35.149 --> 01:15:35.159 align:start position:0%
charge at eight percent they're going to
 
01:15:36.890 --> 01:15:36.900 align:start position:0%
sell it for what they can the money they
 
01:15:38.270 --> 01:15:38.280 align:start position:0%
can get for it and that's going to be
 
01:15:40.189 --> 01:15:40.199 align:start position:0%
the highest number that the highest
 
01:15:43.189 --> 01:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
price they can get and so we would just
 
01:15:45.050 --> 01:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
be driving more of their profit if we
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
tax less it happens in the state with
 
01:15:50.750 --> 01:15:50.760 align:start position:0%
gas prices our gas tax is pretty low but
 
01:15:55.729 --> 01:15:55.739 align:start position:0%
uh relative to Massachusetts and so gas
 
01:15:58.010 --> 01:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
stations closer to the Border can charge
 
01:16:00.590 --> 01:16:00.600 align:start position:0%
more because as long as they charge less
 
01:16:02.510 --> 01:16:02.520 align:start position:0%
than Massachusetts does
 
01:16:04.490 --> 01:16:04.500 align:start position:0%
so that I just wanted to make that
 
01:16:07.070 --> 01:16:07.080 align:start position:0%
clarification representative Southworth
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
thank you I tried to resist but as an
 
01:16:12.229 --> 01:16:12.239 align:start position:0%
education educator this bill does not in
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
any way help children right now teen
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
parties have marijuana and alcohol
 
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
easily available and after we finish our
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
votes they're going to uh I think it's
 
01:16:24.470 --> 01:16:24.480 align:start position:0%
just going to be easier for them to get
 
01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
edibles and things like that that other
 
01:16:29.270 --> 01:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
people buy legally and the idea of a
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
teen party with lots of Edibles where
 
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:33.659 align:start position:0%
people aren't even sure or what they're
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
eating makes me very nervous thank you
 
01:16:38.750 --> 01:16:38.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Ulrich thank
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:43.490 --> 01:16:43.500 align:start position:0%
if we think about how a business
 
01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:46.250 align:start position:0%
if we think about how a business
operates

01:16:46.250 --> 01:16:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
in order for it to come out to a sale
 
01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:49.550 align:start position:0%
in order for it to come out to a sale
price

01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
price
 
01:16:51.830 --> 01:16:51.840 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of factors that go into
 
01:16:56.270 --> 01:16:56.280 align:start position:0%
that but let's take a a meal at a diner
 
01:16:58.430 --> 01:16:58.440 align:start position:0%
we have the meals and rooms taxes added
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
on afterwards so that's a point of sale
 
01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.330 align:start position:0%
on afterwards so that's a point of sale
tax

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:06.770 align:start position:0%
 
however

01:17:06.770 --> 01:17:06.780 align:start position:0%
however
 
01:17:09.649 --> 01:17:09.659 align:start position:0%
the cost of the
 
01:17:12.169 --> 01:17:12.179 align:start position:0%
server the cost of the line cook the the
 
01:17:16.610 --> 01:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
cost of the soup cook the head chef or
 
01:17:19.010 --> 01:17:19.020 align:start position:0%
manager all of that stuff is built into
 
01:17:22.790 --> 01:17:22.800 align:start position:0%
the cost of the individual meal that is
 
01:17:25.070 --> 01:17:25.080 align:start position:0%
set down in front of you
 
01:17:27.229 --> 01:17:27.239 align:start position:0%
if we look at this in the same fashion
 
01:17:29.990 --> 01:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
when you put the tax as we do with the
 
01:17:31.729 --> 01:17:31.739 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise the business profit
 
01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:34.860 align:start position:0%
tax front loaded as a cost of doing
 
01:17:37.610 --> 01:17:37.620 align:start position:0%
business then the business knows what it
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
can sell the product for eventually and
 
01:17:44.350 --> 01:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
knows that everybody that is
 
01:17:47.570 --> 01:17:47.580 align:start position:0%
selling this in a retail level as saying
 
01:17:50.450 --> 01:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
is as has already paid the same that
 
01:17:52.490 --> 01:17:52.500 align:start position:0%
they have on the product that they're
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
selling regarding the depending upon the
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
tier and all that stuff but for the same
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
product the same egg is going to cost
 
01:18:00.950 --> 01:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
this or across the board
 
01:18:03.709 --> 01:18:03.719 align:start position:0%
so by putting it on the front end you're
 
01:18:05.510 --> 01:18:05.520 align:start position:0%
aiding the business by setting up the
 
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
cost for them to do business
 
01:18:10.310 --> 01:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
whereas on if you put it at the top end
 
01:18:13.250 --> 01:18:13.260 align:start position:0%
it depends solely upon how much money
 
01:18:17.770 --> 01:18:17.780 align:start position:0%
the person has who wants to buy it not
 
01:18:22.390 --> 01:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
upon the cost to sell it and that price
 
01:18:24.649 --> 01:18:24.659 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
01:18:26.570 --> 01:18:26.580 align:start position:0%
at the sale
 
01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.850 align:start position:0%
at the sale
uh

01:18:28.850 --> 01:18:28.860 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:18:32.330 --> 01:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
is is totally dependent upon cash flow
 
01:18:35.149 --> 01:18:35.159 align:start position:0%
that's where other states have made
 
01:18:37.790 --> 01:18:37.800 align:start position:0%
errors and have not been able to drive
 
01:18:40.610 --> 01:18:40.620 align:start position:0%
the black market out of business
 
01:18:43.669 --> 01:18:43.679 align:start position:0%
and as was stated on the floor the other
 
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
day arose By Any Other Name is still a
 
01:18:49.390 --> 01:18:49.400 align:start position:0%
sales tax
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
represent Allman did you want to say
 
01:18:55.270 --> 01:18:55.280 align:start position:0%
something yes couple of things on
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
one if
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
we had a sales tax a tax uh an excise
 
01:19:07.250 --> 01:19:07.260 align:start position:0%
tax at the wholesale level that was
 
01:19:10.669 --> 01:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
equivalent to an eight percent excise
 
01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:15.060 align:start position:0%
tax at the retail level on it would have
 
01:19:18.410 --> 01:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
to be 46 percent
 
01:19:20.450 --> 01:19:20.460 align:start position:0%
that's the difference that we're talking
 
01:19:24.050 --> 01:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
about if you want to do this at one
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
percent there is no way that the Liquor
 
01:19:30.649 --> 01:19:30.659 align:start position:0%
Commission is going to be able to do any
 
01:19:32.570 --> 01:19:32.580 align:start position:0%
of the work
 
01:19:37.250 --> 01:19:37.260 align:start position:0%
so on and if it only pays for the Liquor
 
01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:42.659 align:start position:0%
Commission program then you're going to
 
01:19:45.310 --> 01:19:45.320 align:start position:0%
to remove
 
01:19:49.990 --> 01:19:50.000 align:start position:0%
any benefit including the education
 
01:19:53.990 --> 01:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
component that is done by the HHS
 
01:19:58.790 --> 01:19:58.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:01.610 --> 01:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
from from the bill
 
01:20:01.620 --> 01:20:03.290 align:start position:0%
from from the bill
so

01:20:03.290 --> 01:20:03.300 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:20:06.649 --> 01:20:06.659 align:start position:0%
on and the policy of the bill included
 
01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
spending this enormous amount of money
 
01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
we don't have on all of these other
 
01:20:13.550 --> 01:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
things and we've made it somewhat more
 
01:20:16.550 --> 01:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable with the amendment
 
01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:18.890 align:start position:0%
reasonable with the amendment
on

01:20:18.890 --> 01:20:18.900 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:20.570 align:start position:0%
on
we

01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:20:23.450 --> 01:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
if we're going to do this we are going
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
to add to the difficulty of people who
 
01:20:28.550 --> 01:20:28.560 align:start position:0%
are trying to get people not to use
 
01:20:31.550 --> 01:20:31.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis on
 
01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:33.490 align:start position:0%
cannabis on
but

01:20:33.490 --> 01:20:33.500 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:20:37.010 --> 01:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
we are not going to add
 
01:20:40.550 --> 01:20:40.560 align:start position:0%
to their ability to combat it or the
 
01:20:43.130 --> 01:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
ability of of
 
01:20:47.209 --> 01:20:47.219 align:start position:0%
the people who are using cannabis to to
 
01:20:47.219 --> 01:20:48.169 align:start position:0%
the people who are using cannabis to to
um

01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:50.209 --> 01:20:50.219 align:start position:0%
get their lives in order
 
01:20:54.290 --> 01:20:54.300 align:start position:0%
not speaking is I'm kind of neutral on
 
01:20:57.470 --> 01:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
the effect of cannabis myself having
 
01:21:00.229 --> 01:21:00.239 align:start position:0%
been subjected to huge amounts of it
 
01:21:03.290 --> 01:21:03.300 align:start position:0%
when I was in graduate school
 
01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:06.179 align:start position:0%
I just happen to be immune to it so I'm
 
01:21:06.179 --> 01:21:07.689 align:start position:0%
I just happen to be immune to it so I'm
neutral

01:21:07.689 --> 01:21:07.699 align:start position:0%
neutral
 
01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:10.560 align:start position:0%
but on
 
01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:15.480 align:start position:0%
but we do we do need to at least make an
 
01:21:18.470 --> 01:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
effort to produce some of the money that
 
01:21:21.530 --> 01:21:21.540 align:start position:0%
the people who put this bill in we were
 
01:21:24.890 --> 01:21:24.900 align:start position:0%
leaders of both parties
 
01:21:28.490 --> 01:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
wanted to see come out of it
 
01:21:33.370 --> 01:21:33.380 align:start position:0%
and on a eight percent
 
01:21:37.189 --> 01:21:37.199 align:start position:0%
wholesale tax comes down to about two
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
and a half three percent at the retail
 
01:21:44.390 --> 01:21:44.400 align:start position:0%
level it is so much below any other
 
01:21:48.169 --> 01:21:48.179 align:start position:0%
state that we probably would get a fair
 
01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:49.320 align:start position:0%
number of people
 
01:21:51.649 --> 01:21:51.659 align:start position:0%
buying over here but we'd also be losing
 
01:21:55.729 --> 01:21:55.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:58.729 --> 01:21:58.739 align:start position:0%
okay we've gone around once we can go
 
01:22:01.310 --> 01:22:01.320 align:start position:0%
around again you missed me when you I I
 
01:22:03.470 --> 01:22:03.480 align:start position:0%
didn't see your hand up so go ahead and
 
01:22:04.850 --> 01:22:04.860 align:start position:0%
then we'll go
 
01:22:07.490 --> 01:22:07.500 align:start position:0%
thank you the first thing I'd like to
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
say is that unfortunately
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
legalizing cannabis is not going to get
 
01:22:15.649 --> 01:22:15.659 align:start position:0%
rid of the black market it in other
 
01:22:17.990 --> 01:22:18.000 align:start position:0%
states it has just made it worse it
 
01:22:20.330 --> 01:22:20.340 align:start position:0%
makes you know more cannabis floats
 
01:22:23.090 --> 01:22:23.100 align:start position:0%
around and people will you can't really
 
01:22:24.830 --> 01:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
distinguish one from the other you know
 
01:22:27.790 --> 01:22:27.800 align:start position:0%
after it's in the consumer's hand
 
01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:29.350 align:start position:0%
after it's in the consumer's hand
and

01:22:29.350 --> 01:22:29.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:22:32.689 --> 01:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
one of the problems with trying to tax
 
01:22:35.149 --> 01:22:35.159 align:start position:0%
at the wholesale level we heard about
 
01:22:38.149 --> 01:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
this from from people who testified is
 
01:22:40.850 --> 01:22:40.860 align:start position:0%
that some of the people who want to get
 
01:22:44.630 --> 01:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
into this Market will have an integrated
 
01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
system they want to grow the Cannabis
 
01:22:50.570 --> 01:22:50.580 align:start position:0%
themselves process it themselves and be
 
01:22:52.729 --> 01:22:52.739 align:start position:0%
the retail outlet for the for the
 
01:22:52.739 --> 01:22:53.750 align:start position:0%
the retail outlet for the for the
product

01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:53.760 align:start position:0%
product
 
01:22:56.930 --> 01:22:56.940 align:start position:0%
so there's a whole big problem of how
 
01:22:58.669 --> 01:22:58.679 align:start position:0%
are you going to term determine the
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
value when it's integrated like that
 
01:23:06.490 --> 01:23:06.500 align:start position:0%
another issue is that the price of
 
01:23:10.970 --> 01:23:10.980 align:start position:0%
the the raw product the flowers
 
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
um is highly volatile
 
01:23:16.130 --> 01:23:16.140 align:start position:0%
uh and it's it's a commodity it's
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
subject to fluctuations and fluctuations
 
01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
due to the weather but also with the
 
01:23:24.050 --> 01:23:24.060 align:start position:0%
amount of cannabis that's on the market
 
01:23:26.450 --> 01:23:26.460 align:start position:0%
and what other states have seen
 
01:23:29.330 --> 01:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
when they first start up selling
 
01:23:33.290 --> 01:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
legalized cannabis is that the price at
 
01:23:36.169 --> 01:23:36.179 align:start position:0%
the whole tale at the wholesale is quite
 
01:23:40.850 --> 01:23:40.860 align:start position:0%
High and as the cultivators ramp up
 
01:23:43.070 --> 01:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
their operation and they become more
 
01:23:45.250 --> 01:23:45.260 align:start position:0%
efficient and more jump into the market
 
01:23:48.470 --> 01:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
the the price of can the wholesale
 
01:23:51.169 --> 01:23:51.179 align:start position:0%
product goes way down and because
 
01:23:53.450 --> 01:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
they're competing among all the other
 
01:23:56.209 --> 01:23:56.219 align:start position:0%
producers of the Cannabis when you get
 
01:23:58.550 --> 01:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
to the retail level that's a whole
 
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
different business decision I mean
 
01:24:02.870 --> 01:24:02.880 align:start position:0%
you're not selling the product based on
 
01:24:04.970 --> 01:24:04.980 align:start position:0%
what you paid for it you're selling it
 
01:24:06.770 --> 01:24:06.780 align:start position:0%
based on what consumers are going to
 
01:24:09.649 --> 01:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
willing to willing to buy it for you
 
01:24:11.570 --> 01:24:11.580 align:start position:0%
know so that's really two very different
 
01:24:16.070 --> 01:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
things that that are going on here so
 
01:24:18.050 --> 01:24:18.060 align:start position:0%
I that's one of the reasons that I think
 
01:24:21.709 --> 01:24:21.719 align:start position:0%
that we we really have and and when the
 
01:24:24.530 --> 01:24:24.540 align:start position:0%
price of cannabis the raw product is low
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
our revenues are going to be extremely
 
01:24:29.870 --> 01:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
low to tax it at eight percent even if
 
01:24:33.050 --> 01:24:33.060 align:start position:0%
you taxed it at 15 which is in the the
 
01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:35.580 align:start position:0%
actual bill now
 
01:24:37.250 --> 01:24:37.260 align:start position:0%
um you're not you're not gonna haven't
 
01:24:40.310 --> 01:24:40.320 align:start position:0%
have hardly any money you know we we saw
 
01:24:43.790 --> 01:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
the estimate from The Liquor Commission
 
01:24:47.930 --> 01:24:47.940 align:start position:0%
that just the startup costs will be 20
 
01:24:50.450 --> 01:24:50.460 align:start position:0%
million dollars spread over three years
 
01:24:52.430 --> 01:24:52.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to pay that back
 
01:24:54.590 --> 01:24:54.600 align:start position:0%
and then there are ongoing costs they
 
01:24:56.810 --> 01:24:56.820 align:start position:0%
estimate to be four million dollars a
 
01:24:59.689 --> 01:24:59.699 align:start position:0%
year and that's in an attempt to to
 
01:25:02.689 --> 01:25:02.699 align:start position:0%
address you know letting it get into the
 
01:25:04.910 --> 01:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
the hands of children but if if it's
 
01:25:07.550 --> 01:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
legal and a 21 year old can go into the
 
01:25:09.709 --> 01:25:09.719 align:start position:0%
store and buy it you know the kids can
 
01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
get it just like alcohol now you know
 
01:25:14.570 --> 01:25:14.580 align:start position:0%
legalizing it doesn't keep it out of the
 
01:25:17.330 --> 01:25:17.340 align:start position:0%
hands of minors thank you
 
01:25:19.370 --> 01:25:19.380 align:start position:0%
we may be at a point that we could
 
01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
literally discuss this for weeks on end
 
01:25:24.050 --> 01:25:24.060 align:start position:0%
and still probably not get a full
 
01:25:26.030 --> 01:25:26.040 align:start position:0%
consensus it's just one of those topics
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
that's the sense I'm getting from the
 
01:25:29.630 --> 01:25:29.640 align:start position:0%
room so I guess what I'd love to do is
 
01:25:31.130 --> 01:25:31.140 align:start position:0%
just a strop hole just see where we are
 
01:25:33.770 --> 01:25:33.780 align:start position:0%
again we have two concepts proposed in
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
your Amendment one is to tax the retail
 
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
store that's one concept the other
 
01:25:43.910 --> 01:25:43.920 align:start position:0%
concept is the 15 rate
 
01:25:47.090 --> 01:25:47.100 align:start position:0%
yes I would I think that there's one
 
01:25:49.490 --> 01:25:49.500 align:start position:0%
thing we could do we I think we have
 
01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
three options in terms of where we tax
 
01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:53.870 align:start position:0%
three options in terms of where we tax
it

01:25:53.870 --> 01:25:53.880 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:25:56.870 --> 01:25:56.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe we can discuss that first and
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
then talk about the rate
 
01:26:01.010 --> 01:26:01.020 align:start position:0%
I don't know this proposal and the three
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
the three options would be at the
 
01:26:03.600 --> 01:26:05.030 align:start position:0%
the three options would be at the
wholesale

01:26:05.030 --> 01:26:05.040 align:start position:0%
wholesale
 
01:26:10.010 --> 01:26:10.020 align:start position:0%
having the um gross receipts tax and the
 
01:26:11.629 --> 01:26:11.639 align:start position:0%
other option would be having some of
 
01:26:11.639 --> 01:26:14.390 align:start position:0%
other option would be having some of
each

01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:14.400 --> 01:26:18.110 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:26:18.110 --> 01:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:21.110 --> 01:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay well let's right now we have this
 
01:26:23.870 --> 01:26:23.880 align:start position:0%
amendment before us which uh
 
01:26:26.810 --> 01:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
obviously proposes the gross receipts at
 
01:26:28.910 --> 01:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
the retail store level I hope I've got
 
01:26:30.649 --> 01:26:30.659 align:start position:0%
that right
 
01:26:30.659 --> 01:26:32.090 align:start position:0%
that right
okay

01:26:32.090 --> 01:26:32.100 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:26:34.729 --> 01:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of changing from the
 
01:26:36.770 --> 01:26:36.780 align:start position:0%
original bill passed through the house
 
01:26:40.129 --> 01:26:40.139 align:start position:0%
to this new place of the tax raise your
 
01:26:40.139 --> 01:26:49.129 align:start position:0%
to this new place of the tax raise your
hand

six seven eight nine
 
01:26:55.669 --> 01:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
okay so all those opposed just we make
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
sure we get our numbers right
 
01:27:04.070 --> 01:27:04.080 align:start position:0%

01:27:11.040 --> 01:27:12.669 align:start position:0%
who's missing
huh

01:27:12.669 --> 01:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
huh
 
01:27:15.709 --> 01:27:15.719 align:start position:0%
did you count yourself I cut it myself
 
01:27:15.719 --> 01:27:16.729 align:start position:0%
did you count yourself I cut it myself
yeah

01:27:16.729 --> 01:27:16.739 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:27:16.739 --> 01:27:19.750 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:27:19.750 --> 01:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:24.350 --> 01:27:24.360 align:start position:0%
okay so did you vote for the change to
 
01:27:26.810 --> 01:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
this new you vote against it so then
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.129 --> 01:27:34.139 align:start position:0%
no it's not
 
01:27:36.770 --> 01:27:36.780 align:start position:0%
it's not okay we're gonna get better at
 
01:27:39.169 --> 01:27:39.179 align:start position:0%
this part okay clearly raise your hand
 
01:27:41.090 --> 01:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
okay so so we are going to take the
 
01:27:42.530 --> 01:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
straw vote again so we're going to start
 
01:27:45.470 --> 01:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
over this is do we change from the
 
01:27:48.649 --> 01:27:48.659 align:start position:0%
original construct of the bill to tax
 
01:27:52.610 --> 01:27:52.620 align:start position:0%
at the producer level and change it to
 
01:27:54.890 --> 01:27:54.900 align:start position:0%
tax at the retail business level and
 
01:27:57.890 --> 01:27:57.900 align:start position:0%
gross receipts excuse me Madam chair yes
 
01:28:00.169 --> 01:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
you indicated in the first uh straw poll
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
that we would be taxing at 15. the
 
01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
original bill that this was the one
 
01:28:05.460 --> 01:28:06.890 align:start position:0%
original bill that this was the one
premise

01:28:06.890 --> 01:28:06.900 align:start position:0%
premise
 
01:28:06.900 --> 01:28:08.270 align:start position:0%
premise
yeah

01:28:08.270 --> 01:28:08.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:28:10.250 --> 01:28:10.260 align:start position:0%
no no right now we're just talking about
 
01:28:13.430 --> 01:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
where is the tax imposed and we're going
 
01:28:16.550 --> 01:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
to do the 15 on a separate
 
01:28:17.990 --> 01:28:18.000 align:start position:0%
does that make sense
 
01:28:20.270 --> 01:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
are we voting on the representative
 
01:28:23.090 --> 01:28:23.100 align:start position:0%
fellows Amendment no we're breaking it
 
01:28:26.270 --> 01:28:26.280 align:start position:0%
into two portions okay at the retail
 
01:28:28.669 --> 01:28:28.679 align:start position:0%
level please clarify at the retail level
 
01:28:31.490 --> 01:28:31.500 align:start position:0%
at 15 is what we're voting about no
 
01:28:34.189 --> 01:28:34.199 align:start position:0%
we're voting on do we vote at the retail
 
01:28:36.950 --> 01:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
level thank you
 
01:28:39.649 --> 01:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
but the retail level not to the cons to
 
01:28:44.450 --> 01:28:44.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
yes the way she's describing it is the
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
gross receipts which is at the business
 
01:28:52.129 --> 01:28:52.139 align:start position:0%
level right so okay so that's what this
 
01:28:53.870 --> 01:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
amendment proposes can I make one
 
01:28:57.530 --> 01:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:00.169 --> 01:29:00.179 align:start position:0%
let's pull this the concept that
 
01:29:03.610 --> 01:29:03.620 align:start position:0%
representative fellows is uh suggesting
 
01:29:06.530 --> 01:29:06.540 align:start position:0%
relative to this Doucet spillsbury
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
Amendment which captures all of the
 
01:29:12.709 --> 01:29:12.719 align:start position:0%
conversation up to date about how uh to
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
tax at the wholesale level and that's
 
01:29:16.790 --> 01:29:16.800 align:start position:0%
different that language is different
 
01:29:18.470 --> 01:29:18.480 align:start position:0%
from what was in the bill is received
 
01:29:19.729 --> 01:29:19.739 align:start position:0%
from Commerce
 
01:29:21.830 --> 01:29:21.840 align:start position:0%
so I think that's the comparison I I
 
01:29:23.810 --> 01:29:23.820 align:start position:0%
understand your the problem I just did
 
01:29:25.970 --> 01:29:25.980 align:start position:0%
okay I apologize my my mistake there so
 
01:29:28.610 --> 01:29:28.620 align:start position:0%
yes we've already agreed very almost
 
01:29:31.970 --> 01:29:31.980 align:start position:0%
unanimously on the clarification that
 
01:29:34.250 --> 01:29:34.260 align:start position:0%
happened with the spillsbury Ducette
 
01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:36.900 align:start position:0%
Amendment so so this is now A New
 
01:29:38.810 --> 01:29:38.820 align:start position:0%
Concept do you like this New Concept
 
01:29:47.870 --> 01:29:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
six seven eight nine ten
 
01:29:56.850 --> 01:29:56.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.860 --> 01:30:01.430 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:30:01.430 --> 01:30:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.850 --> 01:30:10.860 align:start position:0%
five six seven eight nine ten okay so
 
01:30:13.310 --> 01:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
we're at an impasse there okay so now
 
01:30:15.950 --> 01:30:15.960 align:start position:0%
the second part of this question is this
 
01:30:18.350 --> 01:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
amendment proposes
 
01:30:21.050 --> 01:30:21.060 align:start position:0%
the 15 tax rate
 
01:30:23.390 --> 01:30:23.400 align:start position:0%
no does not
 
01:30:26.330 --> 01:30:26.340 align:start position:0%
could you have a poll to see if anybody
 
01:30:30.410 --> 01:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
might support having some at each level
 
01:30:33.890 --> 01:30:33.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
okay would you like to State your
 
01:30:40.010 --> 01:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
proposal yeah this is just a straw poll
 
01:30:43.310 --> 01:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
would any of you go along with having
 
01:30:45.709 --> 01:30:45.719 align:start position:0%
um part of the revenue raised from
 
01:30:48.229 --> 01:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
attacks at the wholesale level and part
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
of it raised from a retail gross
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
receipts tax so you're talking about two
 
01:30:59.090 --> 01:30:59.100 align:start position:0%
taxes two taxes wine of water yes
 
01:31:01.250 --> 01:31:01.260 align:start position:0%
shouldn't we if we're following
 
01:31:04.010 --> 01:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
procedure vote on the 15 first because
 
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
that already was yes I'm trying to
 
01:31:06.649 --> 01:31:06.659 align:start position:0%
accommodate representative fellows
 
01:31:08.209 --> 01:31:08.219 align:start position:0%
though so she she has thrown this out so
 
01:31:09.410 --> 01:31:09.420 align:start position:0%
let's take a quick vote how many of
 
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
those would want to double tax
 
01:31:14.330 --> 01:31:14.340 align:start position:0%
raise your hands
 
01:31:16.550 --> 01:31:16.560 align:start position:0%
one two
 
01:31:18.649 --> 01:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
that's three three okay
 
01:31:23.530 --> 01:31:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.689 --> 01:31:26.699 align:start position:0%
okay so we can assume that 17-3 so now
 
01:31:30.890 --> 01:31:30.900 align:start position:0%
we'll vote on the 15 tax rate
 
01:31:33.709 --> 01:31:33.719 align:start position:0%
not on the retail gross
 
01:31:37.070 --> 01:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
receipts but on
 
01:31:39.050 --> 01:31:39.060 align:start position:0%
what was described in the spillsberry
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
juice said Amendment 15 on that
 
01:31:46.010 --> 01:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
uh Madam chair yes
 
01:31:48.350 --> 01:31:48.360 align:start position:0%
I think one question has to be settled
 
01:31:49.910 --> 01:31:49.920 align:start position:0%
one way or the other before we get to
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
the rate because that will affect the
 
01:31:55.970 --> 01:31:55.980 align:start position:0%
rate and and uh the the retail level is
 
01:31:58.129 --> 01:31:58.139 align:start position:0%
a change from what past the floor
 
01:32:01.310 --> 01:32:01.320 align:start position:0%
uh and so that's a policy change in my
 
01:32:01.320 --> 01:32:05.770 align:start position:0%
uh and so that's a policy change in my
view

01:32:05.770 --> 01:32:05.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.209 --> 01:32:08.219 align:start position:0%
representative Amy
 
01:32:11.090 --> 01:32:11.100 align:start position:0%
on so is the wholesale rate that you're
 
01:32:11.100 --> 01:32:12.910 align:start position:0%
on so is the wholesale rate that you're
proposing

01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
proposing
 
01:32:16.550 --> 01:32:16.560 align:start position:0%
is a change from the policy that that
 
01:32:20.030 --> 01:32:20.040 align:start position:0%
left the Commerce Committee but it is a
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
tax policy that they did not
 
01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
not a um their policy so
 
01:32:32.390 --> 01:32:32.400 align:start position:0%
um I would just like to say that I don't
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
really care whether it's the wholesale
 
01:32:38.030 --> 01:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
or the retail level but the tax rate has
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
to be adjusted if it's at the wholesale
 
01:32:44.750 --> 01:32:44.760 align:start position:0%
level so that it provides enough Revenue
 
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
so that this is worth doing
 
01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:49.970 align:start position:0%
so that this is worth doing
besides

01:32:49.970 --> 01:32:49.980 align:start position:0%
besides
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
the effect or not of of whether it keeps
 
01:32:56.330 --> 01:32:56.340 align:start position:0%
more of it out of the hands of the young
 
01:33:00.830 --> 01:33:00.840 align:start position:0%
people it also we need the education to
 
01:33:03.649 --> 01:33:03.659 align:start position:0%
go with it we we
 
01:33:07.310 --> 01:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
have major needs in this state that are
 
01:33:09.470 --> 01:33:09.480 align:start position:0%
not being met because we keep on cutting
 
01:33:11.390 --> 01:33:11.400 align:start position:0%
the taxes
 
01:33:14.090 --> 01:33:14.100 align:start position:0%
guys it could turn out that we just are
 
01:33:15.830 --> 01:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
at an impasse and this will go to the
 
01:33:17.990 --> 01:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
floor with a no recommendation I believe
 
01:33:19.729 --> 01:33:19.739 align:start position:0%
most of us do want to pass something
 
01:33:22.189 --> 01:33:22.199 align:start position:0%
here so I hope there is some ability to
 
01:33:24.890 --> 01:33:24.900 align:start position:0%
compromise representative roachford yes
 
01:33:27.709 --> 01:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair just to piggyback
 
01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
on what representative almi said so
 
01:33:33.050 --> 01:33:33.060 align:start position:0%
I think we've all agreed that we wish we
 
01:33:34.490 --> 01:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
had more time we wish we were being
 
01:33:36.890 --> 01:33:36.900 align:start position:0%
involved in the process earlier we wish
 
01:33:38.390 --> 01:33:38.400 align:start position:0%
you had more research but one of the
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
groups that came here and did has done
 
01:33:41.810 --> 01:33:41.820 align:start position:0%
the most research was The Liquor
 
01:33:41.820 --> 01:33:42.890 align:start position:0%
the most research was The Liquor
Commission

01:33:42.890 --> 01:33:42.900 align:start position:0%
Commission
 
01:33:46.010 --> 01:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
and and in you know they've pulled
 
01:33:47.689 --> 01:33:47.699 align:start position:0%
several States they've looked at their
 
01:33:49.310 --> 01:33:49.320 align:start position:0%
taxes the revenues
 
01:33:51.410 --> 01:33:51.420 align:start position:0%
um you know and one of the things that
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
when they were came to testify they were
 
01:33:56.810 --> 01:33:56.820 align:start position:0%
testifying on a 15 cultivator tax and
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
they said in no uncertain terms that a
 
01:34:02.510 --> 01:34:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's a feasible way to to collect the
 
01:34:07.370 --> 01:34:07.380 align:start position:0%
tax and B the 15 is would be adequate to
 
01:34:11.090 --> 01:34:11.100 align:start position:0%
to accommodate their needs so what we've
 
01:34:13.910 --> 01:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
done with the uh do set and the
 
01:34:16.669 --> 01:34:16.679 align:start position:0%
spilsberry amendment is we've we've
 
01:34:19.669 --> 01:34:19.679 align:start position:0%
listened to some of the the concerns and
 
01:34:21.110 --> 01:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
I think that you know there's some
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
concern whether we should be getting
 
01:34:25.550 --> 01:34:25.560 align:start position:0%
taxing at the retail level this splits
 
01:34:27.470 --> 01:34:27.480 align:start position:0%
the difference as taxes at the wholesale
 
01:34:27.480 --> 01:34:28.610 align:start position:0%
the difference as taxes at the wholesale
level

01:34:28.610 --> 01:34:28.620 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
the tax rate is lower because which I
 
01:34:34.669 --> 01:34:34.679 align:start position:0%
think there could be some debate there
 
01:34:37.070 --> 01:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
um but I think it's important to to
 
01:34:39.410 --> 01:34:39.420 align:start position:0%
recognize that they were they were
 
01:34:42.530 --> 01:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
comfortable with with what was came over
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
from Commerce I I'm afraid that if we
 
01:34:47.450 --> 01:34:47.460 align:start position:0%
start mixing things up and act looking
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
at retail taxing and gross receipts it
 
01:34:53.390 --> 01:34:53.400 align:start position:0%
affects the model that they testified on
 
01:34:58.729 --> 01:34:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:00.410 --> 01:35:00.420 align:start position:0%
just sending the
 
01:35:03.350 --> 01:35:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill without any amendments to as as it
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
came to us to the floor if we can't
 
01:35:07.129 --> 01:35:07.139 align:start position:0%
agree on
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
you know changes yes representative only
 
01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:11.209 align:start position:0%
you know changes yes representative only
on

01:35:11.209 --> 01:35:11.219 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:35:14.510 --> 01:35:14.520 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission last year knew
 
01:35:17.330 --> 01:35:17.340 align:start position:0%
absolutely nothing about cannabis
 
01:35:20.209 --> 01:35:20.219 align:start position:0%
and we're but they were supporting it
 
01:35:23.330 --> 01:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
because it was something that
 
01:35:23.340 --> 01:35:25.010 align:start position:0%
because it was something that
was

01:35:25.010 --> 01:35:25.020 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:35:27.169 --> 01:35:27.179 align:start position:0%
needed to be done
 
01:35:27.179 --> 01:35:28.970 align:start position:0%
needed to be done
uh

01:35:28.970 --> 01:35:28.980 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:35:28.980 --> 01:35:30.770 align:start position:0%
uh
they

01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:35:33.350 --> 01:35:33.360 align:start position:0%
their biggest
 
01:35:35.270 --> 01:35:35.280 align:start position:0%
thing in this
 
01:35:37.850 --> 01:35:37.860 align:start position:0%
is they would like to be able to take
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
over the pricing because they do a very
 
01:35:44.930 --> 01:35:44.940 align:start position:0%
good job of pricing on and there is some
 
01:35:48.470 --> 01:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
nod to that in this amendment that we
 
01:35:50.570 --> 01:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
haven't discussed yet
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
um but they are in the business of
 
01:35:57.290 --> 01:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
selling things they aren't in the
 
01:36:00.590 --> 01:36:00.600 align:start position:0%
business of uh keeping the price down so
 
01:36:03.229 --> 01:36:03.239 align:start position:0%
low that that their expenses can't be
 
01:36:07.729 --> 01:36:07.739 align:start position:0%
paid and I do not think that they
 
01:36:10.310 --> 01:36:10.320 align:start position:0%
have worked not none of the people who
 
01:36:12.770 --> 01:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
worked on this bill paid any attention
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:17.460 --> 01:36:19.129 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:36:19.129 --> 01:36:19.139 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:36:21.709 --> 01:36:21.719 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry representative lippley
 
01:36:23.149 --> 01:36:23.159 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:24.890 --> 01:36:24.900 align:start position:0%
um I think representative
 
01:36:26.750 --> 01:36:26.760 align:start position:0%
um might be misremembering we've had a
 
01:36:29.570 --> 01:36:29.580 align:start position:0%
work session and at the work session we
 
01:36:32.030 --> 01:36:32.040 align:start position:0%
asked a number of people directly about
 
01:36:35.149 --> 01:36:35.159 align:start position:0%
taxing at the retail level and it was my
 
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
memory that the Liquor Commission said
 
01:36:40.850 --> 01:36:40.860 align:start position:0%
that that would be an idea that they
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
would support and a number of the other
 
01:36:46.370 --> 01:36:46.380 align:start position:0%
folks that we asked who testified that
 
01:36:49.669 --> 01:36:49.679 align:start position:0%
the retail price could be three to four
 
01:36:52.250 --> 01:36:52.260 align:start position:0%
times as much as the wholesale price and
 
01:36:55.010 --> 01:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
that that is the most transparently set
 
01:36:57.530 --> 01:36:57.540 align:start position:0%
value most transparently set by the
 
01:36:59.750 --> 01:36:59.760 align:start position:0%
market so I think we we may be
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
misremembering the testimony from our
 
01:37:04.090 --> 01:37:04.100 align:start position:0%
most recent work session
 
01:37:07.910 --> 01:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
the other point I wanted to make is that
 
01:37:10.610 --> 01:37:10.620 align:start position:0%
it's true that this bills passed the
 
01:37:10.620 --> 01:37:11.570 align:start position:0%
it's true that this bills passed the
house

01:37:11.570 --> 01:37:11.580 align:start position:0%
house
 
01:37:15.470 --> 01:37:15.480 align:start position:0%
our job as Ways and Means is to put a
 
01:37:17.330 --> 01:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
revenue figure to it that's anything
 
01:37:19.250 --> 01:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
that deals with Revenue that's within
 
01:37:21.950 --> 01:37:21.960 align:start position:0%
our purview so it it troubles me when
 
01:37:23.330 --> 01:37:23.340 align:start position:0%
people say they don't care about the
 
01:37:24.830 --> 01:37:24.840 align:start position:0%
revenue so maybe they'll recuse
 
01:37:27.169 --> 01:37:27.179 align:start position:0%
themselves from voting on the revenue if
 
01:37:28.970 --> 01:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
that's not something they're interested
 
01:37:31.370 --> 01:37:31.380 align:start position:0%
in helping decide
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
um I think that we should go back to
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
what we've established we took straw
 
01:37:38.270 --> 01:37:38.280 align:start position:0%
polls right so we've established that
 
01:37:42.370 --> 01:37:42.380 align:start position:0%
we're tied on representative fellows
 
01:37:45.770 --> 01:37:45.780 align:start position:0%
idea of moving it up to the retail
 
01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:48.179 align:start position:0%
they're 10 4 10 against we've
 
01:37:51.110 --> 01:37:51.120 align:start position:0%
established that the
 
01:37:53.930 --> 01:37:53.940 align:start position:0%
the technical language we agree on
 
01:37:56.450 --> 01:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
and I don't believe there was a majority
 
01:37:59.450 --> 01:37:59.460 align:start position:0%
for the eight percent at the manufacture
 
01:38:02.030 --> 01:38:02.040 align:start position:0%
rate so let's just acknowledge where we
 
01:38:04.250 --> 01:38:04.260 align:start position:0%
are that's why we do stroppels and so
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:10.550 --> 01:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative elberger
 
01:38:12.709 --> 01:38:12.719 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:38:15.830 --> 01:38:15.840 align:start position:0%
we are not a policy committee
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
except in terms of
 
01:38:20.870 --> 01:38:20.880 align:start position:0%
fiscal issues
 
01:38:24.110 --> 01:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
so I think one way that
 
01:38:27.890 --> 01:38:27.900 align:start position:0%
perhaps would help us to sort some of
 
01:38:32.149 --> 01:38:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.790 --> 01:38:34.800 align:start position:0%
is to I wanted to make sure I didn't get
 
01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:36.410 align:start position:0%
is to I wanted to make sure I didn't get
missed

01:38:36.410 --> 01:38:36.420 align:start position:0%
missed
 
01:38:39.709 --> 01:38:39.719 align:start position:0%
is to would be to
 
01:38:41.950 --> 01:38:41.960 align:start position:0%
just have a conversation
 
01:38:45.410 --> 01:38:45.420 align:start position:0%
irrespective of rate or location
 
01:38:47.390 --> 01:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
of the tax
 
01:38:51.050 --> 01:38:51.060 align:start position:0%
about whether it is our belief
 
01:38:51.060 --> 01:38:52.970 align:start position:0%
about whether it is our belief
that

01:38:52.970 --> 01:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:38:52.980 --> 01:38:54.290 align:start position:0%
that
the

01:38:54.290 --> 01:38:54.300 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:56.030 align:start position:0%
the
marijuana

01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
marijuana
 
01:38:58.790 --> 01:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
program for lack of a better term should
 
01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
be at minimum covering the expenses of
 
01:39:06.709 --> 01:39:06.719 align:start position:0%
the program and how much
 
01:39:09.770 --> 01:39:09.780 align:start position:0%
if we agree on that then
 
01:39:12.290 --> 01:39:12.300 align:start position:0%
move forward to how much might we like
 
01:39:14.930 --> 01:39:14.940 align:start position:0%
to generate in excess of that for the
 
01:39:16.610 --> 01:39:16.620 align:start position:0%
additional pieces that we talked about
 
01:39:20.270 --> 01:39:20.280 align:start position:0%
if as my colleague here to the left
 
01:39:23.330 --> 01:39:23.340 align:start position:0%
pointed out he doesn't care
 
01:39:26.330 --> 01:39:26.340 align:start position:0%
about covering the cost of the program
 
01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
then we should talk about that
 
01:39:33.770 --> 01:39:33.780 align:start position:0%
if that is something that uh
 
01:39:35.990 --> 01:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
a majority of the committee believes
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
then we don't need to worry about the
 
01:39:40.970 --> 01:39:40.980 align:start position:0%
tax rate or its location at all
 
01:39:43.550 --> 01:39:43.560 align:start position:0%
if we do want to make sure that we are
 
01:39:46.250 --> 01:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
at the very minimum covering the
 
01:39:48.229 --> 01:39:48.239 align:start position:0%
expenses of the program which is the
 
01:39:52.129 --> 01:39:52.139 align:start position:0%
annual operating cost and The Upfront
 
01:39:55.010 --> 01:39:55.020 align:start position:0%
costs that the state will be covering
 
01:39:58.370 --> 01:39:58.380 align:start position:0%
then we need to figure out how to do
 
01:40:00.229 --> 01:40:00.239 align:start position:0%
that but if we're not in agreement about
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
that basic idea
 
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
then the conversation doesn't happen to
 
01:40:08.810 --> 01:40:08.820 align:start position:0%
have has doesn't have to happen at all
 
01:40:10.070 --> 01:40:10.080 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:40:11.870 --> 01:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
I apologize I missed representative you
 
01:40:13.610 --> 01:40:13.620 align:start position:0%
said and just so you know because some
 
01:40:16.250 --> 01:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
some people are hard for me to see if
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
you can turn on your microphone it does
 
01:40:20.090 --> 01:40:20.100 align:start position:0%
I can see the red it does help me quite
 
01:40:21.590 --> 01:40:21.600 align:start position:0%
a bit uh representative Southworth has
 
01:40:23.510 --> 01:40:23.520 align:start position:0%
gotten very good at that thank you so I
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
apologize representative thank you madam
 
01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:28.260 align:start position:0%
chair and and I agree with you we we
 
01:40:30.590 --> 01:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
could beat this dead horse for a long
 
01:40:33.169 --> 01:40:33.179 align:start position:0%
time we've established a lot of things
 
01:40:35.450 --> 01:40:35.460 align:start position:0%
what we can establish is this we have
 
01:40:37.370 --> 01:40:37.380 align:start position:0%
this bill in front of us that came over
 
01:40:39.250 --> 01:40:39.260 align:start position:0%
to us from the house with an
 
01:40:42.290 --> 01:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly bipartisan position to
 
01:40:46.669 --> 01:40:46.679 align:start position:0%
pass okay secondly we can establish that
 
01:40:48.410 --> 01:40:48.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in general the
 
01:40:51.350 --> 01:40:51.360 align:start position:0%
constituency that we work for supports
 
01:40:53.870 --> 01:40:53.880 align:start position:0%
cannabis legalization
 
01:40:56.090 --> 01:40:56.100 align:start position:0%
enough said I'm not going to tell you my
 
01:40:57.649 --> 01:40:57.659 align:start position:0%
personal opinion but I'm not here for
 
01:40:59.510 --> 01:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
Fred Doucette I'm here for my
 
01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:02.340 align:start position:0%
constituency thirdly that same
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
constituency has told us time and time
 
01:41:09.110 --> 01:41:09.120 align:start position:0%
again I've signed agreements and I do my
 
01:41:11.470 --> 01:41:11.480 align:start position:0%
work day to day to assure that we never
 
01:41:14.990 --> 01:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
never no matter how you label it no
 
01:41:17.689 --> 01:41:17.699 align:start position:0%
matter how you brand it
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
support as sales and or an income tax
 
01:41:24.229 --> 01:41:24.239 align:start position:0%
we're at a point here where I think the
 
01:41:26.149 --> 01:41:26.159 align:start position:0%
majority of this committee can pass this
 
01:41:28.370 --> 01:41:28.380 align:start position:0%
forward to the floor for a vote and it
 
01:41:30.530 --> 01:41:30.540 align:start position:0%
can go to the other side of the wall I
 
01:41:32.330 --> 01:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
can assure you if it goes to the other
 
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
side of the wall with a sales tax you
 
01:41:37.790 --> 01:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
are effectively killing this bill so if
 
01:41:39.470 --> 01:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
that is your plan
 
01:41:41.629 --> 01:41:41.639 align:start position:0%
kill it in Committee just say it out
 
01:41:45.410 --> 01:41:45.420 align:start position:0%
loud Stand by Your Position doesn't it's
 
01:41:48.050 --> 01:41:48.060 align:start position:0%
not my position my position is this
 
01:41:50.990 --> 01:41:51.000 align:start position:0%
we tax it at a reasonable rate
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
I'm a reasonable guy if we change this
 
01:41:56.810 --> 01:41:56.820 align:start position:0%
percentage to a differing percentage the
 
01:41:58.910 --> 01:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
way we proposed representative
 
01:42:01.609 --> 01:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
spilsberry and I proposed how it is
 
01:42:05.090 --> 01:42:05.100 align:start position:0%
taxed at the cultivation and production
 
01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:06.530 align:start position:0%
taxed at the cultivation and production
level

01:42:06.530 --> 01:42:06.540 align:start position:0%
level
 
01:42:08.330 --> 01:42:08.340 align:start position:0%
maybe we could come to an agreement
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
maybe we could work something out maybe
 
01:42:12.109 --> 01:42:12.119 align:start position:0%
we can find something that works for
 
01:42:15.530 --> 01:42:15.540 align:start position:0%
both sides of the aisle here but make no
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
mistake a sales tax is a non-staughter
 
01:42:20.510 --> 01:42:20.520 align:start position:0%
it's dead in the water and you
 
01:42:21.830 --> 01:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
effectively kill it if that's your
 
01:42:24.109 --> 01:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
intent let's kill it off now why we
 
01:42:25.609 --> 01:42:25.619 align:start position:0%
wasting our time
 
01:42:25.619 --> 01:42:26.750 align:start position:0%
wasting our time
so

01:42:26.750 --> 01:42:26.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:28.669 --> 01:42:28.679 align:start position:0%
that that would be my position I would
 
01:42:31.310 --> 01:42:31.320 align:start position:0%
be very open to looking at the
 
01:42:34.729 --> 01:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
percentage at the wholesale rate but
 
01:42:38.090 --> 01:42:38.100 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll motion to retain this if we're
 
01:42:40.250 --> 01:42:40.260 align:start position:0%
stuck on a retail tax because it's not
 
01:42:42.890 --> 01:42:42.900 align:start position:0%
going to happen or we can send it to the
 
01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:44.450 align:start position:0%
going to happen or we can send it to the
floor

01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
and and not complete our work as a Ways
 
01:42:49.790 --> 01:42:49.800 align:start position:0%
and Means Committee
 
01:42:51.169 --> 01:42:51.179 align:start position:0%
all right does it make sense to have
 
01:42:55.430 --> 01:42:55.440 align:start position:0%
emotion keeping the the structure based
 
01:42:57.950 --> 01:42:57.960 align:start position:0%
on the spillsberg you said Amendment and
 
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
proposing a certain rate that we can
 
01:43:04.149 --> 01:43:04.159 align:start position:0%
vote on what rate were we thinking here
 
01:43:06.290 --> 01:43:06.300 align:start position:0%
representative Platt
 
01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm not wedded to eight percent by
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
any means uh I don't buy the argument of
 
01:43:14.330 --> 01:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
two to four times retail that's that
 
01:43:16.550 --> 01:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
works on a reach and that works on a uh
 
01:43:19.430 --> 01:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
illegal market for sure but when it's an
 
01:43:22.330 --> 01:43:22.340 align:start position:0%
open market with anybody any store
 
01:43:25.490 --> 01:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
can do it I just don't buy that kind of
 
01:43:27.770 --> 01:43:27.780 align:start position:0%
markup and so but I'm willing to come up
 
01:43:31.669 --> 01:43:31.679 align:start position:0%
from the ape for sure uh and and uh I
 
01:43:33.229 --> 01:43:33.239 align:start position:0%
was going to suggest nine to stop and
 
01:43:38.510 --> 01:43:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
been up to over here so I apologize
 
01:43:42.709 --> 01:43:42.719 align:start position:0%
um I'll go with ores because his was up
 
01:43:44.270 --> 01:43:44.280 align:start position:0%
and then I apologize I will come over
 
01:43:44.280 --> 01:43:45.109 align:start position:0%
and then I apologize I will come over
here

01:43:45.109 --> 01:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:43:47.209 --> 01:43:47.219 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair so first of all
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
rep leapley was correct uh
 
01:43:55.250 --> 01:43:55.260 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission was talking about
 
01:43:58.010 --> 01:43:58.020 align:start position:0%
taxing at the final product the
 
01:44:00.169 --> 01:44:00.179 align:start position:0%
wholesale level and not at the
 
01:44:02.689 --> 01:44:02.699 align:start position:0%
cultivation level so definitely she got
 
01:44:05.570 --> 01:44:05.580 align:start position:0%
that right uh and I was about to say the
 
01:44:07.189 --> 01:44:07.199 align:start position:0%
same thing although I am against
 
01:44:09.890 --> 01:44:09.900 align:start position:0%
cannabis personally I don't mind sharing
 
01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:10.910 align:start position:0%
cannabis personally I don't mind sharing
that

01:44:10.910 --> 01:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:44:13.310 --> 01:44:13.320 align:start position:0%
everybody I've talked to in my community
 
01:44:16.430 --> 01:44:16.440 align:start position:0%
is against it now I'm an old curmudgeon
 
01:44:19.129 --> 01:44:19.139 align:start position:0%
I realize that I am not running with the
 
01:44:21.590 --> 01:44:21.600 align:start position:0%
18 year old or the college crowd or
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
whatever crowd you might be but the old
 
01:44:26.470 --> 01:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
curmudgeon school that I am part of
 
01:44:29.090 --> 01:44:29.100 align:start position:0%
everybody is against it
 
01:44:32.990 --> 01:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
however I was going to say that
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
I would support a nine or ten percent
 
01:44:38.450 --> 01:44:38.460 align:start position:0%
tax if that's what it takes to get this
 
01:44:41.930 --> 01:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
done at the wholesale final form level
 
01:44:43.729 --> 01:44:43.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:44:45.290 --> 01:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay the whole bunch of hands over here
 
01:44:46.310 --> 01:44:46.320 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which one was first
 
01:44:48.950 --> 01:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
representative Ames well I hope it was
 
01:44:51.890 --> 01:44:51.900 align:start position:0%
you I apologize I couldn't tell
 
01:44:51.900 --> 01:44:53.030 align:start position:0%
you I apologize I couldn't tell
yeah

01:44:53.030 --> 01:44:53.040 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:44:53.040 --> 01:44:54.050 align:start position:0%
yeah
um

01:44:54.050 --> 01:44:54.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:57.169 --> 01:44:57.179 align:start position:0%
so this is how I would chime in uh and
 
01:44:59.629 --> 01:44:59.639 align:start position:0%
how I answer a couple of questions that
 
01:45:01.550 --> 01:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
have been raised
 
01:45:05.629 --> 01:45:05.639 align:start position:0%
um to all of us first is that I want
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
this bill to go forward I want us to
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
find a way to make it happen
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
um and I know it's really difficult
 
01:45:14.290 --> 01:45:14.300 align:start position:0%
because we hold different points of view
 
01:45:18.410 --> 01:45:18.420 align:start position:0%
and different perceptions of the reality
 
01:45:20.990 --> 01:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and you know that's not going to
 
01:45:24.530 --> 01:45:24.540 align:start position:0%
change because it's
 
01:45:29.209 --> 01:45:29.219 align:start position:0%
obscure and hard to know and certainly
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
impossible to predict the future
 
01:45:34.629 --> 01:45:34.639 align:start position:0%
um so that's the first thing I think on
 
01:45:38.750 --> 01:45:38.760 align:start position:0%
sort of the gut sense of Revenue and uh
 
01:45:42.590 --> 01:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
based on all that I've heard and that
 
01:45:45.530 --> 01:45:45.540 align:start position:0%
we've heard together and that I've read
 
01:45:47.629 --> 01:45:47.639 align:start position:0%
about and so forth
 
01:45:52.129 --> 01:45:52.139 align:start position:0%
I I believe I guess it's a belief that
 
01:45:55.910 --> 01:45:55.920 align:start position:0%
this bill whether it's uh at the retail
 
01:45:59.030 --> 01:45:59.040 align:start position:0%
level or at what we're calling the
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
wholesale level but I'll refine that and
 
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
say as defined in the Doucette Amendment
 
01:46:08.810 --> 01:46:08.820 align:start position:0%
will be sufficient most certainly to
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
cover the liquor commission's costs and
 
01:46:15.169 --> 01:46:15.179 align:start position:0%
I would expect some more on that I
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
remain totally skeptical on the use of
 
01:46:21.169 --> 01:46:21.179 align:start position:0%
swept as a vehicle but I'm not going to
 
01:46:22.910 --> 01:46:22.920 align:start position:0%
slow things down
 
01:46:26.450 --> 01:46:26.460 align:start position:0%
for that because I think the
 
01:46:29.209 --> 01:46:29.219 align:start position:0%
um this the swept
 
01:46:31.609 --> 01:46:31.619 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to go off on the side
 
01:46:34.790 --> 01:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
on that but uh but basically swapping
 
01:46:37.970 --> 01:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
one tax for another is not helping
 
01:46:40.729 --> 01:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
education and this is advertised as an
 
01:46:43.970 --> 01:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
education piece it's not it's not it's a
 
01:46:48.229 --> 01:46:48.239 align:start position:0%
swap at the marijuana taxpayer will be
 
01:46:51.590 --> 01:46:51.600 align:start position:0%
paying the revenue instead of the local
 
01:46:55.729 --> 01:46:55.739 align:start position:0%
property taxpayer the people at the
 
01:46:57.890 --> 01:46:57.900 align:start position:0%
school district the kids and so forth
 
01:47:00.290 --> 01:47:00.300 align:start position:0%
will be getting the same amount of money
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
that is the same education so to pretend
 
01:47:07.090 --> 01:47:07.100 align:start position:0%
that this is making education better
 
01:47:11.390 --> 01:47:11.400 align:start position:0%
is a leap maybe it's a coherent leap
 
01:47:12.950 --> 01:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
that somebody could rationalize but
 
01:47:15.050 --> 01:47:15.060 align:start position:0%
that's the way I see it so that's the
 
01:47:16.930 --> 01:47:16.940 align:start position:0%
background really
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
and so where I could I could arrive at
 
01:47:22.850 --> 01:47:22.860 align:start position:0%
it's a little different from maybe what
 
01:47:22.860 --> 01:47:24.109 align:start position:0%
it's a little different from maybe what
you've

01:47:24.109 --> 01:47:24.119 align:start position:0%
you've
 
01:47:26.930 --> 01:47:26.940 align:start position:0%
what one might think I could go along
 
01:47:30.950 --> 01:47:30.960 align:start position:0%
with that wholesale level
 
01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:32.629 align:start position:0%
with that wholesale level
um

01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:37.609 --> 01:47:37.619 align:start position:0%
defined again in the uh Doucet Amendment
 
01:47:39.830 --> 01:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
um and
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
I could do so but certainly not at an
 
01:47:44.990 --> 01:47:45.000 align:start position:0%
eight percent rate
 
01:47:48.290 --> 01:47:48.300 align:start position:0%
um and what I would favor is a 15 rate
 
01:47:51.109 --> 01:47:51.119 align:start position:0%
and one of the one other thing I think
 
01:47:52.790 --> 01:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
that that's reasonable after all this
 
01:47:56.629 --> 01:47:56.639 align:start position:0%
bill came to us as a 15 bill
 
01:47:59.810 --> 01:47:59.820 align:start position:0%
um and it was on the cultivator only but
 
01:48:03.109 --> 01:48:03.119 align:start position:0%
now we've added in the manufacturer
 
01:48:03.119 --> 01:48:04.209 align:start position:0%
now we've added in the manufacturer
um

01:48:04.209 --> 01:48:04.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:04.219 --> 01:48:05.870 align:start position:0%
um
and

01:48:05.870 --> 01:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:07.189 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:09.709 --> 01:48:09.719 align:start position:0%
the other point is that we're not going
 
01:48:11.990 --> 01:48:12.000 align:start position:0%
to see any revenue from this bill for at
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
least two years
 
01:48:15.169 --> 01:48:15.179 align:start position:0%
you know it's just not going to happen
 
01:48:17.990 --> 01:48:18.000 align:start position:0%
because you gotta do regulations you got
 
01:48:19.490 --> 01:48:19.500 align:start position:0%
to set the greenhouses up you got to
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
grow the stuff you gotta process the
 
01:48:24.310 --> 01:48:24.320 align:start position:0%
stuff and get it into retail and then
 
01:48:26.570 --> 01:48:26.580 align:start position:0%
then it's going to go out we're actually
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
going to get probably get money a little
 
01:48:31.669 --> 01:48:31.679 align:start position:0%
earlier if it's at the wholesale level
 
01:48:33.229 --> 01:48:33.239 align:start position:0%
because that's going to come before it's
 
01:48:35.510 --> 01:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
a retail level
 
01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.590 align:start position:0%
a retail level
um

01:48:36.590 --> 01:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:39.169 --> 01:48:39.179 align:start position:0%
and then the other thing that I would
 
01:48:41.149 --> 01:48:41.159 align:start position:0%
want to see in this bill is in
 
01:48:43.310 --> 01:48:43.320 align:start position:0%
representative fellows amendments
 
01:48:45.669 --> 01:48:45.679 align:start position:0%
actually language that I put together
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
and it calls it it requires it's not a
 
01:48:53.689 --> 01:48:53.699 align:start position:0%
call for it requires it's it's her sub
 
01:48:55.450 --> 01:48:55.460 align:start position:0%
paragraph five
 
01:48:58.430 --> 01:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
requiring that the commission study the
 
01:49:00.290 --> 01:49:00.300 align:start position:0%
efficacy of the rating scope of the
 
01:49:03.530 --> 01:49:03.540 align:start position:0%
Cannabis tax imposed by this section
 
01:49:06.350 --> 01:49:06.360 align:start position:0%
and whether ingest adjustments may be
 
01:49:08.930 --> 01:49:08.940 align:start position:0%
needed in said rate and scope in effect
 
01:49:12.010 --> 01:49:12.020 align:start position:0%
is a direction to the commission this
 
01:49:16.550 --> 01:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
cannabis and Liquor Commission to look
 
01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
closely at this issue over the next
 
01:49:19.930 --> 01:49:19.940 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
01:49:24.109 --> 01:49:24.119 align:start position:0%
and thereafter and every every October
 
01:49:26.990 --> 01:49:27.000 align:start position:0%
thereafter file a report with its
 
01:49:29.810 --> 01:49:29.820 align:start position:0%
findings and its recommendations and by
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
that time the the commission will be far
 
01:49:36.649 --> 01:49:36.659 align:start position:0%
more expert than it is now the world
 
01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
will have changed a little bit and if in
 
01:49:44.350 --> 01:49:44.360 align:start position:0%
fact it's true that a
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
attacks let's say as my my version but
 
01:49:51.890 --> 01:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
it's on wholesale at 15 is just not
 
01:49:54.649 --> 01:49:54.659 align:start position:0%
going to produce enough to cover costs
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
well you can bet the Liquor Commission
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
is going to be telling us that and even
 
01:50:01.970 --> 01:50:01.980 align:start position:0%
if they don't we can figure it out and
 
01:50:03.370 --> 01:50:03.380 align:start position:0%
in October
 
01:50:05.890 --> 01:50:05.900 align:start position:0%
we can file bills
 
01:50:08.750 --> 01:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
and seek to change it make it more
 
01:50:08.760 --> 01:50:10.310 align:start position:0%
and seek to change it make it more
sensible

01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
sensible
 
01:50:13.129 --> 01:50:13.139 align:start position:0%
um so I think it's time to correct any
 
01:50:15.709 --> 01:50:15.719 align:start position:0%
bad mistake if that happens this
 
01:50:17.510 --> 01:50:17.520 align:start position:0%
language that I have would force that
 
01:50:19.609 --> 01:50:19.619 align:start position:0%
the only change I'd make
 
01:50:20.930 --> 01:50:20.940 align:start position:0%
no I don't have to change it because
 
01:50:22.490 --> 01:50:22.500 align:start position:0%
it's right here
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
um it starts out October 1 2024 which by
 
01:50:27.350 --> 01:50:27.360 align:start position:0%
the way is when before they're going to
 
01:50:28.729 --> 01:50:28.739 align:start position:0%
get any money but that's all right
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
they'll look at the situation and make a
 
01:50:34.669 --> 01:50:34.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation and uh and they can do so
 
01:50:37.310 --> 01:50:37.320 align:start position:0%
before they start collecting them so
 
01:50:39.109 --> 01:50:39.119 align:start position:0%
that's that's the picture that I paint
 
01:50:42.109 --> 01:50:42.119 align:start position:0%
of what I would find acceptable if we
 
01:50:44.629 --> 01:50:44.639 align:start position:0%
could find some way of putting it into a
 
01:50:47.330 --> 01:50:47.340 align:start position:0%
motion that has that those elements in
 
01:50:50.330 --> 01:50:50.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:52.010 --> 01:50:52.020 align:start position:0%
I'm going to keep going this way because
 
01:50:54.709 --> 01:50:54.719 align:start position:0%
I've done all of these so let me make
 
01:50:55.910 --> 01:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
sure I get these two folks
 
01:50:57.649 --> 01:50:57.659 align:start position:0%
representative ulrey and then we'll go
 
01:51:01.189 --> 01:51:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:02.810 --> 01:51:02.820 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:51:06.050 --> 01:51:06.060 align:start position:0%
so if Heinz I have no problem with
 
01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
another report from an agency I mean you
 
01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:10.250 align:start position:0%
another report from an agency I mean you
know

01:51:10.250 --> 01:51:10.260 align:start position:0%
know
 
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
it's just more paperwork for them to do
 
01:51:13.500 --> 01:51:14.990 align:start position:0%
it's just more paperwork for them to do
um

01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:17.090 --> 01:51:17.100 align:start position:0%
which just fine
 
01:51:20.030 --> 01:51:20.040 align:start position:0%
but you're saying 15 percent
 
01:51:23.629 --> 01:51:23.639 align:start position:0%
is the lowest you'll go or you'll go no
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
higher before negotiating right now
 
01:51:28.729 --> 01:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
let's just get your point yeah well
 
01:51:30.470 --> 01:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
that's my point
 
01:51:32.689 --> 01:51:32.699 align:start position:0%
we need to find a compromise Point
 
01:51:37.430 --> 01:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
someplace between 8 and 15. and I need I
 
01:51:39.169 --> 01:51:39.179 align:start position:0%
think we need to get there some
 
01:51:40.910 --> 01:51:40.920 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly
 
01:51:42.830 --> 01:51:42.840 align:start position:0%
representative Southworth then
 
01:51:45.649 --> 01:51:45.659 align:start position:0%
representative Doucet
 
01:51:48.050 --> 01:51:48.060 align:start position:0%
um a couple of things clarification from
 
01:51:49.310 --> 01:51:49.320 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
01:51:51.410 --> 01:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
um so if for example we had no
 
01:51:53.870 --> 01:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
recommendation it still would start on
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
the floor with ought to pass
 
01:51:59.689 --> 01:51:59.699 align:start position:0%
yes and then also if we didn't if we
 
01:52:02.090 --> 01:52:02.100 align:start position:0%
were still 10 to 10 on the Amendments it
 
01:52:04.010 --> 01:52:04.020 align:start position:0%
would go to the floor with no amendments
 
01:52:06.649 --> 01:52:06.659 align:start position:0%
correct and so the house would just
 
01:52:08.870 --> 01:52:08.880 align:start position:0%
re-vote on it we took a look at it we
 
01:52:11.410 --> 01:52:11.420 align:start position:0%
didn't change it and it would pass again
 
01:52:14.750 --> 01:52:14.760 align:start position:0%
correct I'm just trying to sound a
 
01:52:16.430 --> 01:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
little dire over on the other side I'm
 
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
not sure we do have to retain it because
 
01:52:20.990 --> 01:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
if we didn't do much today it would just
 
01:52:22.430 --> 01:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
go back the way it was the house could
 
01:52:24.229 --> 01:52:24.239 align:start position:0%
pass it again it would go over to the
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
other body is that correct
 
01:52:27.950 --> 01:52:27.960 align:start position:0%
I believe that is correct thank you
 
01:52:29.590 --> 01:52:29.600 align:start position:0%
representative Doucette
 
01:52:33.709 --> 01:52:33.719 align:start position:0%
please yes my constituents are split
 
01:52:37.250 --> 01:52:37.260 align:start position:0%
um but I can say uh absolutely that all
 
01:52:39.290 --> 01:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
of my constituents expect this to be
 
01:52:40.790 --> 01:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
taxed they're not going to be surprised
 
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
at all with alcohol and uh cigarette
 
01:52:45.530 --> 01:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
swing taxed that marijuana would be
 
01:52:47.330 --> 01:52:47.340 align:start position:0%
taxed to they're expecting it to be
 
01:52:49.070 --> 01:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
taxed the people who are for
 
01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
legalization so I'm not really worried
 
01:52:53.629 --> 01:52:53.639 align:start position:0%
about that part what you name it anyway
 
01:52:55.030 --> 01:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:52:56.810 --> 01:52:56.820 align:start position:0%
representative who said I know you had
 
01:52:58.910 --> 01:52:58.920 align:start position:0%
your hand up I apologize no no worries
 
01:53:01.850 --> 01:53:01.860 align:start position:0%
in in in the vein of getting some
 
01:53:04.430 --> 01:53:04.440 align:start position:0%
progress here I I respect what
 
01:53:07.930 --> 01:53:07.940 align:start position:0%
representative Ames said and agree that
 
01:53:10.430 --> 01:53:10.440 align:start position:0%
you know we shouldn't be stuck on one
 
01:53:12.410 --> 01:53:12.420 align:start position:0%
number or another
 
01:53:15.649 --> 01:53:15.659 align:start position:0%
I also with the uh the fellows Ames
 
01:53:18.050 --> 01:53:18.060 align:start position:0%
amendment I would be in total agreement
 
01:53:21.050 --> 01:53:21.060 align:start position:0%
that that section five be drafted in
 
01:53:23.030 --> 01:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
because it should be reviewed and it
 
01:53:24.470 --> 01:53:24.480 align:start position:0%
should be assessed and it should be
 
01:53:27.169 --> 01:53:27.179 align:start position:0%
reported as to adjustments that need to
 
01:53:29.689 --> 01:53:29.699 align:start position:0%
be made under this
 
01:53:33.050 --> 01:53:33.060 align:start position:0%
um I also would offer this up for the
 
01:53:35.510 --> 01:53:35.520 align:start position:0%
sake of moving forward and I'm not
 
01:53:39.229 --> 01:53:39.239 align:start position:0%
negotiating either but I I'd have a hard
 
01:53:41.810 --> 01:53:41.820 align:start position:0%
time voting against a 12 and a half
 
01:53:45.709 --> 01:53:45.719 align:start position:0%
percent tax at wholesale two one two
 
01:53:47.090 --> 01:53:47.100 align:start position:0%
point five
 
01:53:49.010 --> 01:53:49.020 align:start position:0%
at wholesale
 
01:53:55.669 --> 01:53:55.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:57.830 --> 01:53:57.840 align:start position:0%
okay let's see I'll just go around again
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
I appreciate people's willingness to
 
01:54:08.990 --> 01:54:09.000 align:start position:0%
discuss a bill that we all want to see
 
01:54:10.550 --> 01:54:10.560 align:start position:0%
move forward so that feels like a
 
01:54:12.830 --> 01:54:12.840 align:start position:0%
positive development
 
01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:13.609 align:start position:0%
positive development
um

01:54:13.609 --> 01:54:13.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:54:16.310 --> 01:54:16.320 align:start position:0%
another thought is I think we're also
 
01:54:19.129 --> 01:54:19.139 align:start position:0%
concerned about the barriers to this
 
01:54:21.950 --> 01:54:21.960 align:start position:0%
industry and the startup costs and I'm
 
01:54:23.629 --> 01:54:23.639 align:start position:0%
wondering if
 
01:54:25.850 --> 01:54:25.860 align:start position:0%
um there might be room
 
01:54:29.169 --> 01:54:29.179 align:start position:0%
to discuss I believe it's New Mexico
 
01:54:32.570 --> 01:54:32.580 align:start position:0%
has a tax I believe it's on the
 
01:54:35.149 --> 01:54:35.159 align:start position:0%
wholesale it may be on the retail but
 
01:54:38.689 --> 01:54:38.699 align:start position:0%
when they passed legalization they set
 
01:54:40.990 --> 01:54:41.000 align:start position:0%
the tax to increase
 
01:54:44.510 --> 01:54:44.520 align:start position:0%
I think starting in the year 2025 to
 
01:54:46.930 --> 01:54:46.940 align:start position:0%
increase by one percent per year
 
01:54:49.609 --> 01:54:49.619 align:start position:0%
for you know x amount of years not for
 
01:54:52.910 --> 01:54:52.920 align:start position:0%
it to go infinitely up but
 
01:54:55.070 --> 01:54:55.080 align:start position:0%
since we know it is expensive to get
 
01:54:57.290 --> 01:54:57.300 align:start position:0%
into this market and it's difficult we
 
01:55:00.229 --> 01:55:00.239 align:start position:0%
want to keep those barriers low if we
 
01:55:03.590 --> 01:55:03.600 align:start position:0%
started at a 12.5 percent at the
 
01:55:06.709 --> 01:55:06.719 align:start position:0%
wholesale and we're concerned that that
 
01:55:09.770 --> 01:55:09.780 align:start position:0%
might not cover a cost we could Inc you
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
know build in and increase over the
 
01:55:14.209 --> 01:55:14.219 align:start position:0%
following three years that would be a
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism we could discuss in the
 
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
interest of time is again we could keep
 
01:55:20.209 --> 01:55:20.219 align:start position:0%
going around and around on this and I
 
01:55:21.830 --> 01:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
feel like we've had a couple of
 
01:55:24.050 --> 01:55:24.060 align:start position:0%
statements made that may be able to get
 
01:55:25.910 --> 01:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
us somewhere
 
01:55:29.689 --> 01:55:29.699 align:start position:0%
let's do a straw poll on
 
01:55:32.390 --> 01:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
using the wholesale rate as defined by
 
01:55:33.590 --> 01:55:33.600 align:start position:0%
the spillsbury
 
01:55:33.600 --> 01:55:35.030 align:start position:0%
the spillsbury
Amendment

01:55:35.030 --> 01:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:55:37.729 --> 01:55:37.739 align:start position:0%
at 12 and a half percent
 
01:55:40.930 --> 01:55:40.940 align:start position:0%
how many people can vote for that and
 
01:55:44.510 --> 01:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
incorporate this paragraph five which
 
01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
demands the commission come back to us
 
01:55:49.430 --> 01:55:49.440 align:start position:0%
and revisit this issue how many people
 
01:55:52.550 --> 01:55:52.560 align:start position:0%
could support those two things
 
01:55:54.590 --> 01:55:54.600 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry nope I'm sorry representative
 
01:55:57.290 --> 01:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
janigan go ahead sorry hold on
 
01:55:59.450 --> 01:55:59.460 align:start position:0%
representative yeah I'd like to make one
 
01:56:01.189 --> 01:56:01.199 align:start position:0%
statement um
 
01:56:03.649 --> 01:56:03.659 align:start position:0%
I can support representative doucet's
 
01:56:06.410 --> 01:56:06.420 align:start position:0%
12.5 and here's something based on what
 
01:56:08.629 --> 01:56:08.639 align:start position:0%
representative Ames said about
 
01:56:10.850 --> 01:56:10.860 align:start position:0%
and I agree with him that when this bill
 
01:56:12.709 --> 01:56:12.719 align:start position:0%
first came to us let's remember it was
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
passed on the house floor
 
01:56:18.649 --> 01:56:18.659 align:start position:0%
it was 15 however it was formally
 
01:56:21.350 --> 01:56:21.360 align:start position:0%
a cultivator tax now that it's a
 
01:56:21.360 --> 01:56:22.550 align:start position:0%
a cultivator tax now that it's a
cultivator

01:56:22.550 --> 01:56:22.560 align:start position:0%
cultivator
 
01:56:25.490 --> 01:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
and a producer tax 12 and a half makes
 
01:56:28.450 --> 01:56:28.460 align:start position:0%
sense so I think if you if you were okay
 
01:56:31.450 --> 01:56:31.460 align:start position:0%
with 15 before
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
even if you're not think about the house
 
01:56:35.629 --> 01:56:35.639 align:start position:0%
voting for this 12 and a half percent
 
01:56:37.550 --> 01:56:37.560 align:start position:0%
makes sense since we have broadened this
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:56:38.880 --> 01:56:39.890 align:start position:0%
thank you
okay

01:56:39.890 --> 01:56:39.900 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:41.930 --> 01:56:41.940 align:start position:0%
sorry let's just see where we are and
 
01:56:44.209 --> 01:56:44.219 align:start position:0%
then we can keep going all of those in
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
favor of that motion I just made please
 
01:56:47.870 --> 01:56:47.880 align:start position:0%
raise your hand so we can see where
 
01:56:59.209 --> 01:56:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:01.790 --> 01:57:01.800 align:start position:0%
all those opposed
 
01:57:04.729 --> 01:57:04.739 align:start position:0%
hopefully we'll get to the same
 
01:57:08.330 --> 01:57:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:08.340 --> 01:57:10.930 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

01:57:10.930 --> 01:57:10.940 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
okay so that's the best consensus we've
 
01:57:16.550 --> 01:57:16.560 align:start position:0%
had in a while representative uh it's
 
01:57:18.229 --> 01:57:18.239 align:start position:0%
not Heinz I keep looking at the wrong
 
01:57:20.649 --> 01:57:20.659 align:start position:0%
thing representative
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair as a co-sponsor
 
01:57:26.209 --> 01:57:26.219 align:start position:0%
of the bill and a town that said with 65
 
01:57:28.250 --> 01:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
that we want this and and town
 
01:57:30.050 --> 01:57:30.060 align:start position:0%
counselors that send a full
 
01:57:31.609 --> 01:57:31.619 align:start position:0%
um thing we did look at the issue of
 
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
taxing at this level early on so this
 
01:57:35.990 --> 01:57:36.000 align:start position:0%
bill gives us a unique opportunity
 
01:57:37.910 --> 01:57:37.920 align:start position:0%
unlike all the other states that have
 
01:57:40.370 --> 01:57:40.380 align:start position:0%
say 1.5 billion dollars in sale in
 
01:57:41.750 --> 01:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts where they still have a
 
01:57:44.510 --> 01:57:44.520 align:start position:0%
black market by having a lower rate we
 
01:57:46.189 --> 01:57:46.199 align:start position:0%
have the opportunity to actually price
 
01:57:48.770 --> 01:57:48.780 align:start position:0%
out the black market I think the idea of
 
01:57:50.750 --> 01:57:50.760 align:start position:0%
having the commission revisit this makes
 
01:57:52.310 --> 01:57:52.320 align:start position:0%
sense but we may want to have them
 
01:57:53.750 --> 01:57:53.760 align:start position:0%
revisit it once it's been on the market
 
01:57:56.689 --> 01:57:56.699 align:start position:0%
for a year because if we have sales that
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
suggest that we are actually eliminating
 
01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
the black market we may have done
 
01:58:02.390 --> 01:58:02.400 align:start position:0%
something unique in this country that
 
01:58:04.729 --> 01:58:04.739 align:start position:0%
should be recognized so that would just
 
01:58:06.229 --> 01:58:06.239 align:start position:0%
be my one question as to whether we
 
01:58:07.729 --> 01:58:07.739 align:start position:0%
would want them to have a report after
 
01:58:11.089 --> 01:58:11.099 align:start position:0%
2024 or if they can do it's an ongoing
 
01:58:12.350 --> 01:58:12.360 align:start position:0%
basis to see if we've actually
 
01:58:14.810 --> 01:58:14.820 align:start position:0%
eliminated the black market
 
01:58:17.089 --> 01:58:17.099 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Olney
 
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
yes what I didn't get allowed to say
 
01:58:22.930 --> 01:58:22.940 align:start position:0%
before on I apologize about that
 
01:58:27.649 --> 01:58:27.659 align:start position:0%
wholesale uh tax on cigarettes is about
 
01:58:31.070 --> 01:58:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.490 --> 01:58:34.500 align:start position:0%
and it is totally uh ignored by the
 
01:58:35.750 --> 01:58:35.760 align:start position:0%
people buying the cigarettes because
 
01:58:37.790 --> 01:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
it's just a stamp and they don't can't
 
01:58:40.070 --> 01:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
read the stamp anyway
 
01:58:42.770 --> 01:58:42.780 align:start position:0%
um and it's the lowest
 
01:58:46.250 --> 01:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
in the nation I believe and it's the
 
01:58:46.260 --> 01:58:47.870 align:start position:0%
in the nation I believe and it's the
lowest

01:58:47.870 --> 01:58:47.880 align:start position:0%
lowest
 
01:58:47.880 --> 01:58:49.189 align:start position:0%
lowest
um

01:58:49.189 --> 01:58:49.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:51.649 --> 01:58:51.659 align:start position:0%
certainly the lowest in our region and
 
01:58:53.750 --> 01:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
we provide the cigarettes for a large
 
01:58:56.030 --> 01:58:56.040 align:start position:0%
number of people from Massachusetts and
 
01:58:58.629 --> 01:58:58.639 align:start position:0%
Vermont and Maine and Connecticut and
 
01:59:01.129 --> 01:59:01.139 align:start position:0%
sometimes New York if the price of gas
 
01:59:03.229 --> 01:59:03.239 align:start position:0%
isn't too high
 
01:59:06.830 --> 01:59:06.840 align:start position:0%
so on wholesale is a whole different
 
01:59:06.840 --> 01:59:07.910 align:start position:0%
so on wholesale is a whole different
animal

01:59:07.910 --> 01:59:07.920 align:start position:0%
animal
 
01:59:09.770 --> 01:59:09.780 align:start position:0%
than retail
 
01:59:13.370 --> 01:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
and on I would like to see it at
 
01:59:15.709 --> 01:59:15.719 align:start position:0%
wholesale but I think that we should
 
01:59:18.169 --> 01:59:18.179 align:start position:0%
have at least been at 15 percent and
 
01:59:22.189 --> 01:59:22.199 align:start position:0%
probably 25 percent okay would be my
 
01:59:25.550 --> 01:59:25.560 align:start position:0%
bottom estimate okay we just took a vote
 
01:59:27.589 --> 01:59:27.599 align:start position:0%
though so now we have two things we have
 
01:59:29.930 --> 01:59:29.940 align:start position:0%
a majority vote on so we got to keep
 
01:59:33.589 --> 01:59:33.599 align:start position:0%
moving chair I've had my mic on for a
 
01:59:35.570 --> 01:59:35.580 align:start position:0%
long time
 
01:59:37.850 --> 01:59:37.860 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:59:40.910 --> 01:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
so in this last round of discussion I
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
just want to say that there's two things
 
01:59:47.089 --> 01:59:47.099 align:start position:0%
we have not the the wholesale level
 
01:59:51.169 --> 01:59:51.179 align:start position:0%
proposal does not deal with the fact
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
that we know that um the existing some
 
01:59:56.450 --> 01:59:56.460 align:start position:0%
at least some of the existing facilities
 
01:59:58.310 --> 01:59:58.320 align:start position:0%
we have now with for therapeutic
 
02:00:01.570 --> 02:00:01.580 align:start position:0%
cannabis cannabis are integrated
 
02:00:04.689 --> 02:00:04.699 align:start position:0%
companies and they want to
 
02:00:08.810 --> 02:00:08.820 align:start position:0%
do all levels of the production and so
 
02:00:11.689 --> 02:00:11.699 align:start position:0%
we don't have any way to determine what
 
02:00:15.350 --> 02:00:15.360 align:start position:0%
the wholesale value of the the the of
 
02:00:18.169 --> 02:00:18.179 align:start position:0%
the cultivated product we have no way to
 
02:00:20.390 --> 02:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
determine what that is so how are we
 
02:00:22.010 --> 02:00:22.020 align:start position:0%
going to tax that
 
02:00:22.020 --> 02:00:24.189 align:start position:0%
going to tax that
and

02:00:24.189 --> 02:00:24.199 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:00:26.570 --> 02:00:26.580 align:start position:0%
the other thing that I want to point out
 
02:00:30.709 --> 02:00:30.719 align:start position:0%
is that it that this bill at the very
 
02:00:33.129 --> 02:00:33.139 align:start position:0%
beginning under purpose and findings
 
02:00:37.189 --> 02:00:37.199 align:start position:0%
begins with that the purpose of this is
 
02:00:40.550 --> 02:00:40.560 align:start position:0%
allowing num first item allowing law
 
02:00:43.070 --> 02:00:43.080 align:start position:0%
enforcement to focus on violent and
 
02:00:44.870 --> 02:00:44.880 align:start position:0%
property crimes
 
02:00:44.880 --> 02:00:46.310 align:start position:0%
property crimes
second

02:00:46.310 --> 02:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
second
 
02:00:46.320 --> 02:00:47.930 align:start position:0%
second
priority

02:00:47.930 --> 02:00:47.940 align:start position:0%
priority
 
02:00:50.270 --> 02:00:50.280 align:start position:0%
reason for this bill is generating
 
02:00:52.490 --> 02:00:52.500 align:start position:0%
revenue for Education prevention
 
02:00:55.490 --> 02:00:55.500 align:start position:0%
treatment and Recovery it is absolutely
 
02:00:58.609 --> 02:00:58.619 align:start position:0%
our job to make sure that there is money
 
02:01:00.890 --> 02:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
going to be available for those things
 
02:01:04.250 --> 02:01:04.260 align:start position:0%
so we know right off the bat that
 
02:01:07.310 --> 02:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
after we get pay for pay off the
 
02:01:10.729 --> 02:01:10.739 align:start position:0%
development cost at The Liquor
 
02:01:13.669 --> 02:01:13.679 align:start position:0%
Commission the ongoing costs have been
 
02:01:15.770 --> 02:01:15.780 align:start position:0%
estimated at four and a half million a
 
02:01:19.609 --> 02:01:19.619 align:start position:0%
year we need to be able to raise a
 
02:01:21.890 --> 02:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount of money to address
 
02:01:24.229 --> 02:01:24.239 align:start position:0%
these other issues
 
02:01:26.870 --> 02:01:26.880 align:start position:0%
and I don't think taxing at the
 
02:01:29.689 --> 02:01:29.699 align:start position:0%
wholesale level is going to get us there
 
02:01:32.570 --> 02:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
it I would say that when I look at the
 
02:01:35.770 --> 02:01:35.780 align:start position:0%
spot market price of wholesale
 
02:01:38.030 --> 02:01:38.040 align:start position:0%
outdoor cannabis
 
02:01:41.830 --> 02:01:41.840 align:start position:0%
this week on the Cannabis benchmarks
 
02:01:45.649 --> 02:01:45.659 align:start position:0%
that taxing at 15 percent Which is
 
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
higher than than you've been talking
 
02:01:50.149 --> 02:01:50.159 align:start position:0%
about on an ounce of cannabis is going
 
02:01:52.910 --> 02:01:52.920 align:start position:0%
to generate four dollars and fifty cents
 
02:01:55.310 --> 02:01:55.320 align:start position:0%
of Revenue
 
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
and that's you're going to have to sell
 
02:02:00.470 --> 02:02:00.480 align:start position:0%
a heck of a lot of cannabis
 
02:02:04.010 --> 02:02:04.020 align:start position:0%
to get a reasonable amount of money to
 
02:02:07.490 --> 02:02:07.500 align:start position:0%
pay off over 4 million a year plus help
 
02:02:11.330 --> 02:02:11.340 align:start position:0%
education and treatment programs and the
 
02:02:14.390 --> 02:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
police and reimburse the police for the
 
02:02:17.450 --> 02:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
additional enforcement that they'll have
 
02:02:19.669 --> 02:02:19.679 align:start position:0%
to do so that's what I have to say
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:25.430 --> 02:02:25.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I appreciate that last point about
 
02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:27.189 align:start position:0%
yeah I appreciate that last point about
the

02:02:27.189 --> 02:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:31.970 --> 02:02:31.980 align:start position:0%
reality that some some uh sellers of
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
cannabis or some that are in the chain
 
02:02:38.870 --> 02:02:38.880 align:start position:0%
of from gross growing cannabis to its
 
02:02:39.970 --> 02:02:39.980 align:start position:0%
final sale
 
02:02:44.450 --> 02:02:44.460 align:start position:0%
will be integrated operations and I did
 
02:02:47.089 --> 02:02:47.099 align:start position:0%
have I'd lost track of this I did have a
 
02:02:50.270 --> 02:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph that would go into this tax
 
02:02:53.450 --> 02:02:53.460 align:start position:0%
imposed section section
 
02:02:57.410 --> 02:02:57.420 align:start position:0%
um that uh would read as follows the
 
02:02:59.810 --> 02:02:59.820 align:start position:0%
commission may determine the selling or
 
02:03:01.790 --> 02:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
transfer price of the Cannabis or
 
02:03:04.490 --> 02:03:04.500 align:start position:0%
cannabis products when the seller and
 
02:03:06.770 --> 02:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
purchaser are affiliated persons or
 
02:03:09.350 --> 02:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
entities and when the sale or transfer
 
02:03:11.510 --> 02:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
of the Cannabis or cannabis product is
 
02:03:13.910 --> 02:03:13.920 align:start position:0%
not in arm's length the transaction so
 
02:03:16.430 --> 02:03:16.440 align:start position:0%
it makes explicit that one of the jobs
 
02:03:22.450 --> 02:03:22.460 align:start position:0%
of the commission is to price the uh
 
02:03:26.350 --> 02:03:26.360 align:start position:0%
point that cannabis moves
 
02:03:28.450 --> 02:03:28.460 align:start position:0%
uh from
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
the cultivator to a retailer or from the
 
02:03:35.689 --> 02:03:35.699 align:start position:0%
manufacturer to a retailer and makes
 
02:03:38.750 --> 02:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
that clear that that that's the pricing
 
02:03:40.729 --> 02:03:40.739 align:start position:0%
that we're looking for and it's going to
 
02:03:44.089 --> 02:03:44.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:46.250 --> 02:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
well representative spoolsburg
 
02:03:48.229 --> 02:03:48.239 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative Ames I'm
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
just listening to that at first blush it
 
02:03:52.010 --> 02:03:52.020 align:start position:0%
sounds like a constructive Edition that
 
02:03:53.750 --> 02:03:53.760 align:start position:0%
helps to clarify what we've really been
 
02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:54.770 align:start position:0%
helps to clarify what we've really been
saying

02:03:54.770 --> 02:03:54.780 align:start position:0%
saying
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
I would want to look at it more closely
 
02:03:59.570 --> 02:03:59.580 align:start position:0%
with you for example
 
02:03:59.580 --> 02:04:00.229 align:start position:0%
with you for example
um

02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:02.209 --> 02:04:02.219 align:start position:0%
to determine
 
02:04:05.570 --> 02:04:05.580 align:start position:0%
is subject to a competing interpretation
 
02:04:08.570 --> 02:04:08.580 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's to determine is like to
 
02:04:11.689 --> 02:04:11.699 align:start position:0%
discover in other times to determine is
 
02:04:14.750 --> 02:04:14.760 align:start position:0%
to set we don't want in any way suggest
 
02:04:19.189 --> 02:04:19.199 align:start position:0%
that the commission is going to set uh
 
02:04:21.470 --> 02:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
the prices so how about ascertain for
 
02:04:23.870 --> 02:04:23.880 align:start position:0%
example ascertain would be fine and I
 
02:04:26.330 --> 02:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
think then we could go along with that
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
if we Embrace that idea if we embrace
 
02:04:35.930 --> 02:04:35.940 align:start position:0%
section five of the fellows Amendment
 
02:04:35.940 --> 02:04:36.709 align:start position:0%
section five of the fellows Amendment
um

02:04:36.709 --> 02:04:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:38.750 --> 02:04:38.760 align:start position:0%
I think we've really clarified what
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
we've been discussing the ambiguous
 
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
parts of what we've been discussing and
 
02:04:47.390 --> 02:04:47.400 align:start position:0%
we keep the uh the rate we we broadcast
 
02:04:50.030 --> 02:04:50.040 align:start position:0%
that we expect that the rate can be
 
02:04:52.250 --> 02:04:52.260 align:start position:0%
fluid in coming years
 
02:04:54.589 --> 02:04:54.599 align:start position:0%
so let's just settle on a figure today
 
02:04:57.470 --> 02:04:57.480 align:start position:0%
as pragmatists we've narrowed the range
 
02:05:02.030 --> 02:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
12 and a half give or take uh
 
02:05:05.510 --> 02:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
won't it be a great thing given the kind
 
02:05:08.750 --> 02:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
of resounding majority vote we had last
 
02:05:11.330 --> 02:05:11.340 align:start position:0%
month if this committee can come out
 
02:05:13.370 --> 02:05:13.380 align:start position:0%
virtually unanimous
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
so let's just do it if I may just
 
02:05:16.679 --> 02:05:18.649 align:start position:0%
so let's just do it if I may just
representative

02:05:18.649 --> 02:05:18.659 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:05:18.659 --> 02:05:19.550 align:start position:0%
representative
um

02:05:19.550 --> 02:05:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
I take your point and uh it may be okay
 
02:05:26.030 --> 02:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
to leave it as is this language that I
 
02:05:28.010 --> 02:05:28.020 align:start position:0%
read to you is straight out of the
 
02:05:31.310 --> 02:05:31.320 align:start position:0%
Illinois statute which has a tax on the
 
02:05:33.050 --> 02:05:33.060 align:start position:0%
co at the cultivator level and that's
 
02:05:35.030 --> 02:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
why they felt they needed
 
02:05:37.370 --> 02:05:37.380 align:start position:0%
language like this I suspect our Liquor
 
02:05:39.770 --> 02:05:39.780 align:start position:0%
Commission would welcome tax language
 
02:05:40.930 --> 02:05:40.940 align:start position:0%
like this
 
02:05:44.149 --> 02:05:44.159 align:start position:0%
so I would encourage it I guess while
 
02:05:46.189 --> 02:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
I've got the mic I might as well respond
 
02:05:51.410 --> 02:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
to uh two two a suggestion a proposal
 
02:05:53.689 --> 02:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
and a request
 
02:05:56.570 --> 02:05:56.580 align:start position:0%
friend here
 
02:06:01.330 --> 02:06:01.340 align:start position:0%
and that is the proposal was
 
02:06:05.030 --> 02:06:05.040 align:start position:0%
that the tax rate would be 12.5 percent
 
02:06:07.370 --> 02:06:07.380 align:start position:0%
on the
 
02:06:11.209 --> 02:06:11.219 align:start position:0%
um on on the proposal that I had made
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
instead of 15 and
 
02:06:14.159 --> 02:06:14.689 align:start position:0%
instead of 15 and
um

02:06:14.689 --> 02:06:14.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:06:17.930 --> 02:06:17.940 align:start position:0%
and you had asked me to come up with
 
02:06:26.270 --> 02:06:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
and that's to you know just get it out
 
02:06:28.320 --> 02:06:29.209 align:start position:0%
and that's to you know just get it out
there

02:06:29.209 --> 02:06:29.219 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:06:29.219 --> 02:06:32.290 align:start position:0%
there
it's

02:06:32.290 --> 02:06:32.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:34.370 --> 02:06:34.380 align:start position:0%
I think we might want to take another
 
02:06:37.850 --> 02:06:37.860 align:start position:0%
straw vote just to see where we're at
 
02:06:39.350 --> 02:06:39.360 align:start position:0%
um because again we could discuss this
 
02:06:41.450 --> 02:06:41.460 align:start position:0%
all day and I apologize I don't I just
 
02:06:44.030 --> 02:06:44.040 align:start position:0%
don't know when we would ever stop
 
02:06:45.770 --> 02:06:45.780 align:start position:0%
discussing this so right now we have
 
02:06:47.689 --> 02:06:47.699 align:start position:0%
another revised proposal we already had
 
02:06:51.830 --> 02:06:51.840 align:start position:0%
passed with the majority 13 to 7 a 12.5
 
02:06:51.840 --> 02:06:53.629 align:start position:0%
passed with the majority 13 to 7 a 12.5
percent

02:06:53.629 --> 02:06:53.639 align:start position:0%
percent
 
02:06:55.850 --> 02:06:55.860 align:start position:0%
could we get more people if we went to
 
02:06:58.609 --> 02:06:58.619 align:start position:0%
13 and Incorporated some of these
 
02:07:01.129 --> 02:07:01.139 align:start position:0%
technical improvements that we've just
 
02:07:03.950 --> 02:07:03.960 align:start position:0%
discussed so that is the question on the
 
02:07:05.209 --> 02:07:05.219 align:start position:0%
table now
 
02:07:08.629 --> 02:07:08.639 align:start position:0%
how many people would support 13 percent
 
02:07:10.790 --> 02:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
making sure the commission comes back to
 
02:07:13.850 --> 02:07:13.860 align:start position:0%
us with information giving them some
 
02:07:16.189 --> 02:07:16.199 align:start position:0%
more technical clarifications how many
 
02:07:18.589 --> 02:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
people could support that keeping it at
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
the wholesale level
 
02:07:22.550 --> 02:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
as described by the spillsburg amendment
 
02:07:27.410 --> 02:07:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
do we get any votes do we add any people
 
02:07:31.850 --> 02:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
to that no we lost
 
02:07:35.450 --> 02:07:35.460 align:start position:0%
we lost point of order
 
02:07:40.729 --> 02:07:40.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:42.410 --> 02:07:42.420 align:start position:0%
so we didn't get make any progress with
 
02:07:45.649 --> 02:07:45.659 align:start position:0%
that representative homie Madam chair on
 
02:07:50.229 --> 02:07:50.239 align:start position:0%
just this is just procedural uh it's 110
 
02:07:54.830 --> 02:07:54.840 align:start position:0%
I have two amendments one of which is
 
02:07:58.089 --> 02:07:58.099 align:start position:0%
critical to this thing namely changing
 
02:08:00.950 --> 02:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations for the Liquor
 
02:08:03.290 --> 02:08:03.300 align:start position:0%
Commission so that they can start to
 
02:08:09.109 --> 02:08:09.119 align:start position:0%
work uh and the other of which is on has
 
02:08:12.290 --> 02:08:12.300 align:start position:0%
a lot of cleaning up of Errata that was
 
02:08:16.790 --> 02:08:16.800 align:start position:0%
not found so far and is except that they
 
02:08:20.450 --> 02:08:20.460 align:start position:0%
didn't put some of my cleanup into into
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
the amendment that they did I have the
 
02:08:26.750 --> 02:08:26.760 align:start position:0%
original language which I'd need to go
 
02:08:28.850 --> 02:08:28.860 align:start position:0%
back to them for
 
02:08:30.370 --> 02:08:30.380 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:08:32.510 --> 02:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
on and
 
02:08:35.810 --> 02:08:35.820 align:start position:0%
on fixing the
 
02:08:39.229 --> 02:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
the nomenclature and the funding of the
 
02:08:44.390 --> 02:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
treatment facilities the way they had on
 
02:08:47.330 --> 02:08:47.340 align:start position:0%
expected to be in the bill as it came
 
02:08:47.340 --> 02:08:48.169 align:start position:0%
expected to be in the bill as it came
out

02:08:48.169 --> 02:08:48.179 align:start position:0%
out
 
02:08:48.179 --> 02:08:49.550 align:start position:0%
out
uh

02:08:49.550 --> 02:08:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:08:52.910 --> 02:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
from the Commerce Committee at the last
 
02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:54.229 align:start position:0%
from the Commerce Committee at the last
minute

02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
minute
 
02:08:58.250 --> 02:08:58.260 align:start position:0%
with on some major drafting issues let's
 
02:08:58.260 --> 02:08:59.990 align:start position:0%
with on some major drafting issues let's
see

02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:09:02.810 --> 02:09:02.820 align:start position:0%
and also fixing the language of the
 
02:09:05.030 --> 02:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission which has major
 
02:09:07.850 --> 02:09:07.860 align:start position:0%
drafting errors at this point because if
 
02:09:09.350 --> 02:09:09.360 align:start position:0%
they want to keep
 
02:09:12.470 --> 02:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
liquor separate from Cannabis this bill
 
02:09:15.050 --> 02:09:15.060 align:start position:0%
ain't going to do it
 
02:09:17.209 --> 02:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
point of order
 
02:09:19.189 --> 02:09:19.199 align:start position:0%
I know you have a plan
 
02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
um right now we're at 13 7.
 
02:09:24.530 --> 02:09:24.540 align:start position:0%
those numbers are almost identical to
 
02:09:28.669 --> 02:09:28.679 align:start position:0%
our constituents vote and the House vote
 
02:09:31.209 --> 02:09:31.219 align:start position:0%
I mean it's about two-thirds one-thirds
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
yeah to me my my sense of you know we
 
02:09:36.290 --> 02:09:36.300 align:start position:0%
should move on because now we have
 
02:09:39.169 --> 02:09:39.179 align:start position:0%
enough of a majority on two things two
 
02:09:41.930 --> 02:09:41.940 align:start position:0%
two major chunks and now we'd move on to
 
02:09:43.850 --> 02:09:43.860 align:start position:0%
some other things although it sounds
 
02:09:45.410 --> 02:09:45.420 align:start position:0%
like representative Alma you need to go
 
02:09:47.510 --> 02:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
back to OLS to get that fixed before you
 
02:09:52.550 --> 02:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:56.270 --> 02:09:56.280 align:start position:0%
I asked them to do they forgot they
 
02:09:59.149 --> 02:09:59.159 align:start position:0%
forgot a small part of it so here's a
 
02:10:01.370 --> 02:10:01.380 align:start position:0%
Here's a thought we could uh break now
 
02:10:03.770 --> 02:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
so you guys can get some lunch and then
 
02:10:06.470 --> 02:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
I know OLS is going to have to do some
 
02:10:07.669 --> 02:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
work here and we're going to have to
 
02:10:09.709 --> 02:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
come back right it sounds like we've got
 
02:10:11.570 --> 02:10:11.580 align:start position:0%
a lot we've got a lot of Corrections it
 
02:10:12.770 --> 02:10:12.780 align:start position:0%
sounds like representative Ames
 
02:10:14.510 --> 02:10:14.520 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury need to get
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
together and get their language together
 
02:10:18.350 --> 02:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
fine tune what we've already agreed on
 
02:10:20.209 --> 02:10:20.219 align:start position:0%
what the majority agreed on and put that
 
02:10:21.649 --> 02:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
into one Amendment
 
02:10:23.270 --> 02:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
that would give you time to get your
 
02:10:26.209 --> 02:10:26.219 align:start position:0%
fixes done at OLS and then maybe we come
 
02:10:29.149 --> 02:10:29.159 align:start position:0%
back at two ish does that sound close
 
02:10:31.209 --> 02:10:31.219 align:start position:0%
and can they do that I know I don't know
 
02:10:33.310 --> 02:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
that's a good question representative
 
02:10:36.770 --> 02:10:36.780 align:start position:0%
maybe tomorrow I just they got it very
 
02:10:40.189 --> 02:10:40.199 align:start position:0%
they got my stuff very fast this morning
 
02:10:42.410 --> 02:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
because they didn't look at it until
 
02:10:46.729 --> 02:10:46.739 align:start position:0%
this morning and I haven't had a chance
 
02:10:49.070 --> 02:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
to look completely at what they may have
 
02:10:50.990 --> 02:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
missed or not I apologize I saw a bunch
 
02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
of hands I don't know representative
 
02:10:54.830 --> 02:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
Doucette but it's all are there any
 
02:10:58.310 --> 02:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
other amendments to be offered to this
 
02:11:00.950 --> 02:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
piece yes representative Almy has
 
02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
several but oh there's more yes
 
02:11:04.880 --> 02:11:06.609 align:start position:0%
several but oh there's more yes
right

02:11:06.609 --> 02:11:06.619 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:11:09.830 --> 02:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
do we want to discuss that now or after
 
02:11:09.840 --> 02:11:12.890 align:start position:0%
do we want to discuss that now or after
or

02:11:12.890 --> 02:11:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:14.750 --> 02:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
yeah well so we have an opportunity to
 
02:11:16.550 --> 02:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
take a little break now while people
 
02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
start we're fine-tuning their amendments
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
that we know we need to be fine-tuned
 
02:11:24.589 --> 02:11:24.599 align:start position:0%
um or we can keep going it's up to you I
 
02:11:26.209 --> 02:11:26.219 align:start position:0%
think we should do his Amendment now
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
because he's got it ready okay yeah
 
02:11:32.570 --> 02:11:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:34.850 --> 02:11:34.860 align:start position:0%
and again I'm so glad we didn't start
 
02:11:37.729 --> 02:11:37.739 align:start position:0%
this the year with this bill in a way
 
02:11:39.649 --> 02:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
because this is tough and I thank you
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
for your hard work would have been nice
 
02:11:52.010 --> 02:11:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:57.709 --> 02:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:08.350 --> 02:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:11.870 --> 02:12:11.880 align:start position:0%
I did yes I sent them around yeah
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:17.810 --> 02:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
page 12.
 
02:12:17.820 --> 02:12:19.850 align:start position:0%
page 12.
yeah

02:12:19.850 --> 02:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
02:12:22.250 --> 02:12:22.260 align:start position:0%
actually it's on the bottom of page 11
 
02:12:25.010 --> 02:12:25.020 align:start position:0%
is where this starts but the meat of it
 
02:12:47.149 --> 02:12:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:49.310 --> 02:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping this uh this isn't a
 
02:12:52.370 --> 02:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
dramatic this is this isn't huge
 
02:12:55.310 --> 02:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
um if you look on page 12 uh when they
 
02:12:57.790 --> 02:12:57.800 align:start position:0%
talk about dual use
 
02:13:00.350 --> 02:13:00.360 align:start position:0%
certificates so facilities that are
 
02:13:02.089 --> 02:13:02.099 align:start position:0%
therapeutic and also want to get into
 
02:13:04.430 --> 02:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
retail sales
 
02:13:07.370 --> 02:13:07.380 align:start position:0%
um this is the only section that I could
 
02:13:10.850 --> 02:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
find where defines a specific price for
 
02:13:14.089 --> 02:13:14.099 align:start position:0%
a license or an application fee if you
 
02:13:16.129 --> 02:13:16.139 align:start position:0%
look on page seven it gives guidelines
 
02:13:18.709 --> 02:13:18.719 align:start position:0%
for application fees for other for the
 
02:13:20.510 --> 02:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
retail facilities or other facilities
 
02:13:23.089 --> 02:13:23.099 align:start position:0%
but this where this is it specifically
 
02:13:24.530 --> 02:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
defines that where it says the
 
02:13:26.930 --> 02:13:26.940 align:start position:0%
commission shall Levy a ten thousand
 
02:13:29.870 --> 02:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
dollar application fee for a dual yield
 
02:13:34.189 --> 02:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
certificate and if approved it will
 
02:13:37.129 --> 02:13:37.139 align:start position:0%
continue to it will charge a ninety
 
02:13:40.189 --> 02:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar licensing fee with no
 
02:13:43.669 --> 02:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
expiration date so this amendment just
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
eliminates that uh ten thousand dollar
 
02:13:49.609 --> 02:13:49.619 align:start position:0%
application fee it eliminates the ninety
 
02:13:51.709 --> 02:13:51.719 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar license fee and it
 
02:13:53.810 --> 02:13:53.820 align:start position:0%
eliminates the uh
 
02:13:55.970 --> 02:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
you know indefinite
 
02:13:59.870 --> 02:13:59.880 align:start position:0%
expiration date for that so the the
 
02:14:04.910 --> 02:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
commission is empowered on page seven
 
02:14:11.149 --> 02:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
um lines 23 through uh 2032 to actually
 
02:14:14.209 --> 02:14:14.219 align:start position:0%
develop fees so we're just eliminating
 
02:14:18.770 --> 02:14:18.780 align:start position:0%
this uh this very prescriptive fee for
 
02:14:20.569 --> 02:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
for a couple reasons one because I think
 
02:14:22.870 --> 02:14:22.880 align:start position:0%
it's high and I think these facilities
 
02:14:26.770 --> 02:14:26.780 align:start position:0%
are probably well adapted and um
 
02:14:30.470 --> 02:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
accustomed to to doing this business uh
 
02:14:32.030 --> 02:14:32.040 align:start position:0%
so to add a hundred thousand dollars on
 
02:14:33.350 --> 02:14:33.360 align:start position:0%
top of that I don't think is is
 
02:14:35.510 --> 02:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
necessarily right the other thing that I
 
02:14:37.669 --> 02:14:37.679 align:start position:0%
I think is problematic with defining
 
02:14:39.530 --> 02:14:39.540 align:start position:0%
this is when the commission starts
 
02:14:41.930 --> 02:14:41.940 align:start position:0%
looking at other fees and other
 
02:14:44.330 --> 02:14:44.340 align:start position:0%
licensing application fees and Licensing
 
02:14:46.609 --> 02:14:46.619 align:start position:0%
fees they're going to look to well
 
02:14:48.589 --> 02:14:48.599 align:start position:0%
there's a conflict but first of all
 
02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
they're going to look to this as what's
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
the standard fee that we have and a
 
02:14:54.050 --> 02:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars is could be
 
02:14:56.510 --> 02:14:56.520 align:start position:0%
their their Baseline
 
02:14:59.330 --> 02:14:59.340 align:start position:0%
um uh as they look to develop a
 
02:15:01.189 --> 02:15:01.199 align:start position:0%
comparison however the problem that the
 
02:15:05.510 --> 02:15:05.520 align:start position:0%
conflict arises in page seven line 30 it
 
02:15:07.430 --> 02:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
says the non-refundable portion
 
02:15:09.410 --> 02:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
application fee shall not exceed a
 
02:15:11.810 --> 02:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars adjusted for inflation
 
02:15:15.589 --> 02:15:15.599 align:start position:0%
which having done fees for regulated
 
02:15:18.950 --> 02:15:18.960 align:start position:0%
Industries that's more in line with
 
02:15:20.930 --> 02:15:20.940 align:start position:0%
reality than a ten thousand dollar
 
02:15:23.810 --> 02:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
application fee uh and certainly a
 
02:15:26.149 --> 02:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
ninety thousand dollar license fee is is
 
02:15:28.370 --> 02:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
out of line so that's the amendment
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
that's what the amendment does and um
 
02:15:33.290 --> 02:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
that's about it
 
02:15:35.629 --> 02:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
okay we're I'm not sure who was first
 
02:15:37.189 --> 02:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
representative almi go ahead and then
 
02:15:41.290 --> 02:15:41.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:43.930 --> 02:15:43.940 align:start position:0%
this on
 
02:15:47.410 --> 02:15:47.420 align:start position:0%
these I was a little shocked by this too
 
02:15:51.530 --> 02:15:51.540 align:start position:0%
but I'm not we no longer have the Liquor
 
02:15:56.149 --> 02:15:56.159 align:start position:0%
Commission here we no longer have the on
 
02:15:59.209 --> 02:15:59.219 align:start position:0%
the gentleman who came here to talk
 
02:16:03.649 --> 02:16:03.659 align:start position:0%
three times now I think from on the the
 
02:16:08.629 --> 02:16:08.639 align:start position:0%
health HHS group that is running these
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
alternative oh oh that's you
 
02:16:13.970 --> 02:16:13.980 align:start position:0%
so maybe can can you ask him to talk
 
02:16:16.729 --> 02:16:16.739 align:start position:0%
about this I believe that this is what
 
02:16:19.490 --> 02:16:19.500 align:start position:0%
you call an Enterprise fee which is
 
02:16:22.069 --> 02:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
something that is illegal and less
 
02:16:22.079 --> 02:16:23.450 align:start position:0%
something that is illegal and less
regulated

02:16:23.450 --> 02:16:23.460 align:start position:0%
regulated
 
02:16:27.410 --> 02:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
uh and it's the kind of fees that the
 
02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:30.360 align:start position:0%
casino bills always had before you
 
02:16:32.270 --> 02:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
turned it into a charitable Enterprise
 
02:16:32.280 --> 02:16:34.310 align:start position:0%
turned it into a charitable Enterprise
uh

02:16:34.310 --> 02:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:16:37.310 --> 02:16:37.320 align:start position:0%
so um
 
02:16:40.129 --> 02:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
um maybe you can you talk about the
 
02:16:48.009 --> 02:16:48.019 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:50.870 --> 02:16:50.880 align:start position:0%
yeah come on up and recognize if you
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
could just introduce yourself and just
 
02:16:55.190 --> 02:16:55.200 align:start position:0%
help us just specifically on these
 
02:16:57.110 --> 02:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
application and Licensing fees that
 
02:16:59.150 --> 02:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
we're entertaining removing yes thank
 
02:17:00.709 --> 02:17:00.719 align:start position:0%
you madam chair my name is Michael Holt
 
02:17:02.870 --> 02:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
I am the administrator for the
 
02:17:04.030 --> 02:17:04.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:17:06.250 --> 02:17:06.260 align:start position:0%
Division of Public Health Services
 
02:17:09.589 --> 02:17:09.599 align:start position:0%
therapeutic cannabis program
 
02:17:13.910 --> 02:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
um so these these this dual use fee has
 
02:17:15.770 --> 02:17:15.780 align:start position:0%
a bit of a history
 
02:17:19.009 --> 02:17:19.019 align:start position:0%
um my understanding is that this hundred
 
02:17:21.049 --> 02:17:21.059 align:start position:0%
thousand dollar combined application
 
02:17:24.169 --> 02:17:24.179 align:start position:0%
license uh certificate fee was to be
 
02:17:27.290 --> 02:17:27.300 align:start position:0%
directed to a social Equity Fund
 
02:17:30.650 --> 02:17:30.660 align:start position:0%
um in the original legislation that that
 
02:17:34.429 --> 02:17:34.439 align:start position:0%
uh that was removed when the bill was
 
02:17:34.439 --> 02:17:35.929 align:start position:0%
uh that was removed when the bill was
introduced

02:17:35.929 --> 02:17:35.939 align:start position:0%
introduced
 
02:17:38.209 --> 02:17:38.219 align:start position:0%
um but those fees remained in the bill
 
02:17:40.549 --> 02:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
and they were redirected basically to
 
02:17:43.610 --> 02:17:43.620 align:start position:0%
the the Cannabis uh Commission Now
 
02:17:45.349 --> 02:17:45.359 align:start position:0%
change to the Liquor Commission the
 
02:17:47.330 --> 02:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
liquor and cannabis commission and so
 
02:17:49.549 --> 02:17:49.559 align:start position:0%
it's unclear to me if that up to seven
 
02:17:51.589 --> 02:17:51.599 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
um would was needed for the Liquor
 
02:17:55.429 --> 02:17:55.439 align:start position:0%
Commission to run the program
 
02:17:56.990 --> 02:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
um they've not testified on that so I'm
 
02:17:58.429 --> 02:17:58.439 align:start position:0%
assuming that that was not part of their
 
02:18:00.770 --> 02:18:00.780 align:start position:0%
their fiscal note so we have this this
 
02:18:03.410 --> 02:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
bucket of money hundred hundred thousand
 
02:18:06.589 --> 02:18:06.599 align:start position:0%
dollars per dispensary location of which
 
02:18:08.589 --> 02:18:08.599 align:start position:0%
there are currently seven in the state
 
02:18:10.849 --> 02:18:10.859 align:start position:0%
that could
 
02:18:15.830 --> 02:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
pay into pay this fee to begin serving
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
adult use patients they've got the
 
02:18:20.270 --> 02:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities built out they've
 
02:18:23.150 --> 02:18:23.160 align:start position:0%
got the retail facilities uh built out
 
02:18:25.849 --> 02:18:25.859 align:start position:0%
many states have done this before
 
02:18:28.370 --> 02:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
um it is a way to uh get to Market
 
02:18:30.230 --> 02:18:30.240 align:start position:0%
sooner than
 
02:18:31.969 --> 02:18:31.979 align:start position:0%
um than than waiting for the entire
 
02:18:35.330 --> 02:18:35.340 align:start position:0%
adult use Market to get built out and so
 
02:18:37.910 --> 02:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
this originally served two purposes one
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
to feed a social Equity Fund and two uh
 
02:18:42.290 --> 02:18:42.300 align:start position:0%
to increase time to Market to get adult
 
02:18:45.950 --> 02:18:45.960 align:start position:0%
use sales uh moving and so
 
02:18:48.410 --> 02:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
this is uh so this is my this is my
 
02:18:49.849 --> 02:18:49.859 align:start position:0%
pitch I don't know whether or not this
 
02:18:51.410 --> 02:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
is an Enterprise tax or is illegal
 
02:18:53.089 --> 02:18:53.099 align:start position:0%
representative homie I can't speak to
 
02:18:54.349 --> 02:18:54.359 align:start position:0%
that piece
 
02:18:56.330 --> 02:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
um but the issue that the Department of
 
02:18:58.610 --> 02:18:58.620 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services has is that
 
02:19:01.849 --> 02:19:01.859 align:start position:0%
there is no appropriation
 
02:19:05.690 --> 02:19:05.700 align:start position:0%
for a preliminary public education
 
02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:08.580 align:start position:0%
campaign about the risks of cannabis use
 
02:19:12.110 --> 02:19:12.120 align:start position:0%
in various populations there is a
 
02:19:15.169 --> 02:19:15.179 align:start position:0%
requirement for the Department to uh to
 
02:19:17.450 --> 02:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
to conduct that public education
 
02:19:20.209 --> 02:19:20.219 align:start position:0%
campaign but it is funded
 
02:19:22.929 --> 02:19:22.939 align:start position:0%
by the bill after
 
02:19:25.610 --> 02:19:25.620 align:start position:0%
through Revenue right so there's there's
 
02:19:27.950 --> 02:19:27.960 align:start position:0%
there that we have the responsibility of
 
02:19:29.629 --> 02:19:29.639 align:start position:0%
conducting public education campaigns
 
02:19:31.490 --> 02:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
about the risk of cannabis use but
 
02:19:33.230 --> 02:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
there's no money to do that until
 
02:19:37.129 --> 02:19:37.139 align:start position:0%
Revenue starts coming in and the the x
 
02:19:38.690 --> 02:19:38.700 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
02:19:40.429 --> 02:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
um is paid back by The Liquor Commission
 
02:19:40.439 --> 02:19:41.990 align:start position:0%
um is paid back by The Liquor Commission
so

02:19:41.990 --> 02:19:42.000 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:19:43.549 --> 02:19:43.559 align:start position:0%
um this is a this is an issue that is
 
02:19:47.330 --> 02:19:47.340 align:start position:0%
both policy and Financial in that
 
02:19:50.570 --> 02:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
um there's we feel the need believe the
 
02:19:53.929 --> 02:19:53.939 align:start position:0%
need for preliminary funds to fund a
 
02:19:56.510 --> 02:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
public education campaign I believe uh
 
02:19:58.429 --> 02:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
representative Almy has um has an
 
02:20:00.650 --> 02:20:00.660 align:start position:0%
amendment in her in her stack that would
 
02:20:03.530 --> 02:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
fund that preliminarily
 
02:20:07.010 --> 02:20:07.020 align:start position:0%
um one other idea was in order to fund
 
02:20:08.929 --> 02:20:08.939 align:start position:0%
it properly is that those fees
 
02:20:11.150 --> 02:20:11.160 align:start position:0%
regardless of whether they are too high
 
02:20:13.849 --> 02:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
or or not that's a different issue could
 
02:20:18.410 --> 02:20:18.420 align:start position:0%
be redirected to HHS for that fund so in
 
02:20:20.870 --> 02:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
place of removing the fee entirely the
 
02:20:23.150 --> 02:20:23.160 align:start position:0%
atcs could be a source of funds
 
02:20:26.210 --> 02:20:26.220 align:start position:0%
supplementary funds you know to HHS for
 
02:20:28.670 --> 02:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
performing that function and that was an
 
02:20:30.770 --> 02:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
idea that I uh that we had brought up uh
 
02:20:33.650 --> 02:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
to representative Almy for consideration
 
02:20:37.550 --> 02:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:41.150 --> 02:20:41.160 align:start position:0%
so how's that great thank you it was
 
02:20:42.530 --> 02:20:42.540 align:start position:0%
very helpful to have your perspective of
 
02:20:44.389 --> 02:20:44.399 align:start position:0%
course I'm wondering it from a business
 
02:20:45.710 --> 02:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
perspective a hundred thousand dollars
 
02:20:47.929 --> 02:20:47.939 align:start position:0%
seems like a lot of money would that be
 
02:20:50.270 --> 02:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
a huge barrier but that's all just I
 
02:20:51.889 --> 02:20:51.899 align:start position:0%
will say that there is at least one
 
02:20:53.450 --> 02:20:53.460 align:start position:0%
member of uh representative from the
 
02:20:56.570 --> 02:20:56.580 align:start position:0%
atcs here as well his name is Matt Simon
 
02:20:58.190 --> 02:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
um he he may have an opinion on the
 
02:21:00.230 --> 02:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
amount of the money but again that was
 
02:21:02.270 --> 02:21:02.280 align:start position:0%
some that that amount was signed off on
 
02:21:04.429 --> 02:21:04.439 align:start position:0%
before the bill was introduced to be
 
02:21:06.530 --> 02:21:06.540 align:start position:0%
dedicated to uh essentially a social
 
02:21:08.270 --> 02:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
Equity Fund uh to build training
 
02:21:10.250 --> 02:21:10.260 align:start position:0%
opportunities for you know farmers and
 
02:21:11.690 --> 02:21:11.700 align:start position:0%
for disadvantaged
 
02:21:14.510 --> 02:21:14.520 align:start position:0%
um uh entities to enter the Cannabis uh
 
02:21:14.520 --> 02:21:15.530 align:start position:0%
um uh entities to enter the Cannabis uh
Market

02:21:15.530 --> 02:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
Market
 
02:21:16.309 --> 02:21:16.319 align:start position:0%
um that if they had been
 
02:21:18.830 --> 02:21:18.840 align:start position:0%
disproportionately uh impacted by the
 
02:21:21.170 --> 02:21:21.180 align:start position:0%
War on Drugs thank you that's all gone
 
02:21:24.349 --> 02:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
from it but the fee remains okay so
 
02:21:25.969 --> 02:21:25.979 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:21:28.730 --> 02:21:28.740 align:start position:0%
um all right so we have uh this
 
02:21:31.910 --> 02:21:31.920 align:start position:0%
amendment before us
 
02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:35.030 align:start position:0%
amendment before us
representatively

02:21:35.030 --> 02:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
I just had a question I think the the
 
02:21:39.889 --> 02:21:39.899 align:start position:0%
point race is very valid I think we need
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
to stop and discuss this it sounds like
 
02:21:43.190 --> 02:21:43.200 align:start position:0%
way too much money to me
 
02:21:43.200 --> 02:21:44.090 align:start position:0%
way too much money to me
um

02:21:44.090 --> 02:21:44.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:21:47.330 --> 02:21:47.340 align:start position:0%
just a clarification and if I'm just in
 
02:21:49.429 --> 02:21:49.439 align:start position:0%
error please help me
 
02:21:52.510 --> 02:21:52.520 align:start position:0%
um is the same amount
 
02:21:56.450 --> 02:21:56.460 align:start position:0%
charged to for every retail license that
 
02:21:59.090 --> 02:21:59.100 align:start position:0%
is available because my impression was
 
02:22:01.010 --> 02:22:01.020 align:start position:0%
that this is just for them
 
02:22:03.650 --> 02:22:03.660 align:start position:0%
no actually if you look on page seven
 
02:22:05.809 --> 02:22:05.819 align:start position:0%
um it charges the and it is it's
 
02:22:08.870 --> 02:22:08.880 align:start position:0%
specifically called out in the bill dual
 
02:22:13.070 --> 02:22:13.080 align:start position:0%
use certificates so it we just heard
 
02:22:15.290 --> 02:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
it's taking seven individuals seven
 
02:22:18.349 --> 02:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
entities in in
 
02:22:22.130 --> 02:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
making them fund uh whatever they had a
 
02:22:23.630 --> 02:22:23.640 align:start position:0%
fund now they're not even we don't even
 
02:22:24.650 --> 02:22:24.660 align:start position:0%
know where the money's going around
 
02:22:27.050 --> 02:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
right but no uh so if you look at page
 
02:22:27.060 --> 02:22:28.370 align:start position:0%
right but no uh so if you look at page
seven

02:22:28.370 --> 02:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
seven
 
02:22:30.650 --> 02:22:30.660 align:start position:0%
um and this is where it gets interesting
 
02:22:34.250 --> 02:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
page seven line 28 and 30 it says the
 
02:22:36.770 --> 02:22:36.780 align:start position:0%
commission shall the shall establish
 
02:22:40.490 --> 02:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
fees uh that the non-refundable portion
 
02:22:42.950 --> 02:22:42.960 align:start position:0%
of the application fees shall not exceed
 
02:22:44.570 --> 02:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollars for the regular
 
02:22:47.570 --> 02:22:47.580 align:start position:0%
retail you know Mom and Pops but they're
 
02:22:50.690 --> 02:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
10 times that for for these dual use
 
02:22:53.510 --> 02:22:53.520 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like the story behind it is
 
02:22:55.309 --> 02:22:55.319 align:start position:0%
you know something was pulled out and
 
02:22:56.809 --> 02:22:56.819 align:start position:0%
maybe this just needs to be cleaned up
 
02:22:58.969 --> 02:22:58.979 align:start position:0%
and done the same
 
02:23:01.309 --> 02:23:01.319 align:start position:0%
represent only
 
02:23:04.429 --> 02:23:04.439 align:start position:0%
two things one on
 
02:23:07.190 --> 02:23:07.200 align:start position:0%
my I have two amendments one amendment
 
02:23:12.110 --> 02:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
was from uh DHHS with some
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
additions that had nothing to do with
 
02:23:18.170 --> 02:23:18.180 align:start position:0%
the amendment uh erotic Corrections on
 
02:23:22.190 --> 02:23:22.200 align:start position:0%
on but the the other one is the
 
02:23:24.290 --> 02:23:24.300 align:start position:0%
Appropriations one and that one can
 
02:23:28.370 --> 02:23:28.380 align:start position:0%
function with with or without this 700
 
02:23:31.309 --> 02:23:31.319 align:start position:0%
000 coming in it just takes longer to
 
02:23:34.750 --> 02:23:34.760 align:start position:0%
pay off the debt if if it isn't there
 
02:23:39.889 --> 02:23:39.899 align:start position:0%
but to the other thing is could we ask
 
02:23:44.330 --> 02:23:44.340 align:start position:0%
Mr Simon to tell us what they know about
 
02:23:46.070 --> 02:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
02:23:50.389 --> 02:23:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:51.770 --> 02:23:51.780 align:start position:0%
sure I'll just
 
02:23:53.630 --> 02:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
happy to do that thank you for being
 
02:23:55.190 --> 02:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
here of course this is not a public
 
02:23:57.110 --> 02:23:57.120 align:start position:0%
hearing so we just we can't get too
 
02:23:58.849 --> 02:23:58.859 align:start position:0%
crazy with this but thank you very much
 
02:24:00.110 --> 02:24:00.120 align:start position:0%
for being here
 
02:24:03.110 --> 02:24:03.120 align:start position:0%
my pleasure very briefly Matt Simon
 
02:24:06.110 --> 02:24:06.120 align:start position:0%
Prime ATC and I did testify to this so I
 
02:24:08.270 --> 02:24:08.280 align:start position:0%
think it's just a reminder I agree with
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
the way Mr Holt characterized this we
 
02:24:13.130 --> 02:24:13.140 align:start position:0%
agreed to the Dual use fees during the
 
02:24:15.410 --> 02:24:15.420 align:start position:0%
drafting process with the understanding
 
02:24:17.630 --> 02:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
that those funds would be going towards
 
02:24:19.610 --> 02:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
a cannabis Business Development Fund and
 
02:24:22.010 --> 02:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
a Justice reinvestment fund both of
 
02:24:24.070 --> 02:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
which we thought were very good causes
 
02:24:27.290 --> 02:24:27.300 align:start position:0%
we want to try to help create a cannabis
 
02:24:28.730 --> 02:24:28.740 align:start position:0%
Marketplace that New Hampshire can
 
02:24:30.590 --> 02:24:30.600 align:start position:0%
really be proud of and it was in that
 
02:24:33.530 --> 02:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
spirit that we agreed to these fees
 
02:24:35.929 --> 02:24:35.939 align:start position:0%
now that those fees are gone I asked are
 
02:24:37.849 --> 02:24:37.859 align:start position:0%
these fees still appropriate should they
 
02:24:40.969 --> 02:24:40.979 align:start position:0%
be reduced or eliminated for example the
 
02:24:43.070 --> 02:24:43.080 align:start position:0%
fee for an integrated license in Vermont
 
02:24:44.929 --> 02:24:44.939 align:start position:0%
which is pretty similar to what we're
 
02:24:46.969 --> 02:24:46.979 align:start position:0%
talking about here is fifty thousand
 
02:24:49.309 --> 02:24:49.319 align:start position:0%
dollars which is half of that so that's
 
02:24:53.389 --> 02:24:53.399 align:start position:0%
just one one data point but
 
02:24:54.950 --> 02:24:54.960 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any other
 
02:24:56.210 --> 02:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
questions if you have them but don't
 
02:24:57.710 --> 02:24:57.720 align:start position:0%
want to take up your time
 
02:24:59.210 --> 02:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
thank you very much we really appreciate
 
02:25:03.110 --> 02:25:03.120 align:start position:0%
that so we have an amendment before us
 
02:25:03.120 --> 02:25:03.950 align:start position:0%
that so we have an amendment before us
um

02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:07.550 --> 02:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
I just want to get a sense from people
 
02:25:09.410 --> 02:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
representative fellows would you have
 
02:25:12.230 --> 02:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
something so if
 
02:25:14.990 --> 02:25:15.000 align:start position:0%
with the elimination of those lines in
 
02:25:18.290 --> 02:25:18.300 align:start position:0%
here does it still allow the Cannabis
 
02:25:22.070 --> 02:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
licorice liquor cannabis commission to
 
02:25:25.309 --> 02:25:25.319 align:start position:0%
assess some kind of fee
 
02:25:27.410 --> 02:25:27.420 align:start position:0%
yes representative Rosewood if you could
 
02:25:28.969 --> 02:25:28.979 align:start position:0%
point that out but I believe it's in the
 
02:25:32.210 --> 02:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
original Bill uh page seven they kind of
 
02:25:34.010 --> 02:25:34.020 align:start position:0%
goes through all that to come up with a
 
02:25:34.020 --> 02:25:35.270 align:start position:0%
goes through all that to come up with a
reasonable

02:25:35.270 --> 02:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:25:35.280 --> 02:25:37.849 align:start position:0%
reasonable
fee

02:25:37.849 --> 02:25:37.859 align:start position:0%
fee
 
02:25:42.650 --> 02:25:42.660 align:start position:0%
which is how things are normally done uh
 
02:25:44.809 --> 02:25:44.819 align:start position:0%
especially a new emerging business like
 
02:25:46.610 --> 02:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
this what what is normal what is
 
02:25:48.950 --> 02:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate I'm not sure any of us
 
02:25:52.010 --> 02:25:52.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:54.170 --> 02:25:54.180 align:start position:0%
other than comparing to other states I
 
02:25:56.570 --> 02:25:56.580 align:start position:0%
guess and I I mean I I don't know
 
02:25:58.730 --> 02:25:58.740 align:start position:0%
because this is new in New Hampshire
 
02:26:00.590 --> 02:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
um having come from the background of a
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
regular regulated business and having a
 
02:26:04.730 --> 02:26:04.740 align:start position:0%
day job that does licensing for
 
02:26:08.929 --> 02:26:08.939 align:start position:0%
regulated businesses I mean you know
 
02:26:11.450 --> 02:26:11.460 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire is top of the list for
 
02:26:14.929 --> 02:26:14.939 align:start position:0%
fees uh but even that where one of the
 
02:26:16.370 --> 02:26:16.380 align:start position:0%
one of the ones it's like two thousand
 
02:26:19.309 --> 02:26:19.319 align:start position:0%
dollars for a two-year license uh 500
 
02:26:21.349 --> 02:26:21.359 align:start position:0%
for various fees
 
02:26:24.469 --> 02:26:24.479 align:start position:0%
um you know uh like I said I work around
 
02:26:26.870 --> 02:26:26.880 align:start position:0%
the country and I think you know two to
 
02:26:28.490 --> 02:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars is the most we've
 
02:26:32.809 --> 02:26:32.819 align:start position:0%
ever seen for dealing in narcotics
 
02:26:34.670 --> 02:26:34.680 align:start position:0%
represent homie
 
02:26:37.910 --> 02:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
yes I'd just like to add that I believe
 
02:26:41.090 --> 02:26:41.100 align:start position:0%
these numbers for the Enterprise came
 
02:26:44.990 --> 02:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
out of the discussion about having one
 
02:26:50.270 --> 02:26:50.280 align:start position:0%
major Casino in Salem
 
02:26:52.910 --> 02:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
and on that
 
02:26:56.750 --> 02:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
that it for each of the Cannabis
 
02:27:00.469 --> 02:27:00.479 align:start position:0%
cultivation facilities and dual use
 
02:27:04.010 --> 02:27:04.020 align:start position:0%
facilities to to have to come up with a
 
02:27:06.770 --> 02:27:06.780 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars does seem
 
02:27:09.190 --> 02:27:09.200 align:start position:0%
pretty much out of line
 
02:27:13.910 --> 02:27:13.920 align:start position:0%
with one major in the whole state
 
02:27:13.920 --> 02:27:16.010 align:start position:0%
with one major in the whole state
Casino

02:27:16.010 --> 02:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
Casino
 
02:27:16.020 --> 02:27:17.750 align:start position:0%
Casino
Arizona

02:27:17.750 --> 02:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
Arizona
 
02:27:17.760 --> 02:27:18.530 align:start position:0%
Arizona
um

02:27:18.530 --> 02:27:18.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:21.410 --> 02:27:21.420 align:start position:0%
thank you I was wondering now that we
 
02:27:24.050 --> 02:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
have all of the I think amendments on
 
02:27:25.849 --> 02:27:25.859 align:start position:0%
the table and we're not going to be
 
02:27:27.530 --> 02:27:27.540 align:start position:0%
completely blindsided by any new
 
02:27:29.750 --> 02:27:29.760 align:start position:0%
information if it might be okay if we
 
02:27:31.309 --> 02:27:31.319 align:start position:0%
take lunch and we can all kind of
 
02:27:31.319 --> 02:27:32.990 align:start position:0%
take lunch and we can all kind of
percolate

02:27:32.990 --> 02:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
percolate
 
02:27:33.000 --> 02:27:33.710 align:start position:0%
percolate
um

02:27:33.710 --> 02:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:27:37.150 --> 02:27:37.160 align:start position:0%
just a request thank you
 
02:27:40.610 --> 02:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
that's a great suggestion so uh so
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
basically it's 1 30 so I'm going to open
 
02:27:44.330 --> 02:27:44.340 align:start position:0%
the exact session and then I'm going to
 
02:27:46.910 --> 02:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
recess the exact session until what time
 
02:27:49.550 --> 02:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
do you think 2 30 should we shoot for
 
02:27:51.170 --> 02:27:51.180 align:start position:0%
that 2 30
 
02:27:56.150 --> 02:27:56.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:58.429 --> 02:27:58.439 align:start position:0%
you should have your amendments cleaned
 
02:27:59.870 --> 02:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
up and ready to go by then if you
 
02:28:01.190 --> 02:28:01.200 align:start position:0%
possibly can
 
02:28:01.200 --> 02:28:04.670 align:start position:0%
possibly can
okay

02:28:04.670 --> 02:28:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:06.770 --> 02:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
well we we got to see yours but you told
 
02:28:08.210 --> 02:28:08.220 align:start position:0%
us it was wrong so we need the right
 
02:28:09.770 --> 02:28:09.780 align:start position:0%
version so if you can get the right
 
02:28:09.780 --> 02:28:15.410 align:start position:0%
version so if you can get the right
version

02:28:15.410 --> 02:28:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:17.630 --> 02:28:17.640 align:start position:0%
can you put on your mic so we can just
 
02:28:19.309 --> 02:28:19.319 align:start position:0%
real quick guys can you focus on what
 
02:28:20.690 --> 02:28:20.700 align:start position:0%
representative Almy has to say real
 
02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
quick before you head out yeah they
 
02:28:27.290 --> 02:28:27.300 align:start position:0%
um one of them was a track changes with
 
02:28:27.300 --> 02:28:29.090 align:start position:0%
um one of them was a track changes with
red

02:28:29.090 --> 02:28:29.100 align:start position:0%
red
 
02:28:32.210 --> 02:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
on it and it says Amendment one change
 
02:28:34.130 --> 02:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
of Appropriations doesn't even say it's
 
02:28:42.530 --> 02:28:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:46.790 --> 02:28:46.800 align:start position:0%
the liquor uh for the uh
 
02:28:53.330 --> 02:28:53.340 align:start position:0%
mostly for HHS is four pages on
 
02:28:56.110 --> 02:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
double-sided two pages stapled together
 
02:29:00.469 --> 02:29:00.479 align:start position:0%
with every single change in
 
02:29:05.570 --> 02:29:05.580 align:start position:0%
in the um original bill as amended that
 
02:29:07.309 --> 02:29:07.319 align:start position:0%
we've been dealing with
 
02:29:10.670 --> 02:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
on and a little bit of it intersects
 
02:29:13.730 --> 02:29:13.740 align:start position:0%
with representative but nothing that
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:22.610 --> 02:29:22.620 align:start position:0%
okay so everyone make sure you look at
 
02:29:26.750 --> 02:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
those and come back at 2 30. it's a lot
 
02:29:29.929 --> 02:29:29.939 align:start position:0%
easier to look at because the ones that
 
02:29:34.670 --> 02:29:34.680 align:start position:0%
that they gave me are repealing and
 
02:29:37.190 --> 02:29:37.200 align:start position:0%
reenacting different language which
 
02:29:38.870 --> 02:29:38.880 align:start position:0%
means that you can't even see the
 
02:29:38.880 --> 02:29:42.370 align:start position:0%
means that you can't even see the
changes

02:29:42.370 --> 02:29:42.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:46.190 --> 02:29:46.200 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to represent only could uh
 
02:29:49.010 --> 02:29:49.020 align:start position:0%
combine that all into one Amendment
 
02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:50.690 align:start position:0%
combine that all into one Amendment
uh

02:29:50.690 --> 02:29:50.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:29:53.450 --> 02:29:53.460 align:start position:0%
I could do that but it's two totally
 
02:29:54.889 --> 02:29:54.899 align:start position:0%
different issues
 
02:29:59.630 --> 02:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
the Appropriations is is pretty quick to
 
02:30:01.730 --> 02:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
understand and it's about the
 
02:30:04.730 --> 02:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
Appropriations whereas the other one
 
02:30:07.670 --> 02:30:07.680 align:start position:0%
well I did include the Errata in here
 
02:30:09.950 --> 02:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
but so that's right so I have another
 
02:30:13.550 --> 02:30:13.560 align:start position:0%
trying to separate take take the
 
02:30:16.969 --> 02:30:16.979 align:start position:0%
Cannabis commission out of things is
 
02:30:20.530 --> 02:30:20.540 align:start position:0%
somebody doing an amendment on
 
02:30:24.710 --> 02:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
the tax imposed which is on page 22 and
 
02:30:28.370 --> 02:30:28.380 align:start position:0%
has the 15 percent uh cultivation taxes
 
02:30:29.809 --> 02:30:29.819 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that representative
 
02:30:33.170 --> 02:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
spilsbury was going to his Amendment
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
changing that and work with
 
02:30:36.590 --> 02:30:36.600 align:start position:0%
representative Ames on some of the
 
02:30:38.630 --> 02:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
additional language and put that onto
 
02:30:42.170 --> 02:30:42.180 align:start position:0%
one so it's easier to to put
 
02:30:45.830 --> 02:30:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative Ames language that's
 
02:30:48.110 --> 02:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
did you want to rewrite this or keep it
 
02:30:54.170 --> 02:30:54.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:55.610 --> 02:30:55.620 align:start position:0%
oh okay
 
02:30:59.030 --> 02:30:59.040 align:start position:0%
so so as the essence paragraph five will
 
02:31:00.290 --> 02:31:00.300 align:start position:0%
be incorporated
 
02:31:02.750 --> 02:31:02.760 align:start position:0%
as well as the other uh that
 
02:31:06.590 --> 02:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:07.969 --> 02:31:07.979 align:start position:0%
excellent I know you guys are probably
 
02:31:10.610 --> 02:31:10.620 align:start position:0%
starving thank you so much and I know
 
02:31:12.170 --> 02:31:12.180 align:start position:0%
this is really tough but I really
 
03:13:26.570 --> 03:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:26.580 --> 03:47:07.309 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:47:07.309 --> 03:47:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:22.750 --> 03:51:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:22.760 --> 03:51:24.429 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:51:24.429 --> 03:51:24.439 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:51:28.550 --> 03:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
so we are not an exec session We are
 
03:51:31.729 --> 03:51:31.739 align:start position:0%
continuing a work session
 
03:51:34.250 --> 03:51:34.260 align:start position:0%
I think because do we have an amendment
 
03:51:40.429 --> 03:51:40.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:43.670 --> 03:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:46.610 --> 03:51:46.620 align:start position:0%
out on
 
03:51:49.370 --> 03:51:49.380 align:start position:0%
and she's doing that and she said she'd
 
03:51:51.830 --> 03:51:51.840 align:start position:0%
try to get it over but I don't have high
 
03:51:53.870 --> 03:51:53.880 align:start position:0%
hopes that she'll get it over quickly
 
03:51:57.050 --> 03:51:57.060 align:start position:0%
okay well why don't you do you have two
 
03:51:58.429 --> 03:51:58.439 align:start position:0%
different things here right so why don't
 
03:52:00.830 --> 03:52:00.840 align:start position:0%
you bring up one at a time I mean the
 
03:52:00.840 --> 03:52:02.150 align:start position:0%
you bring up one at a time I mean the
the

03:52:02.150 --> 03:52:02.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:52:09.290 --> 03:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:12.469 --> 03:52:12.479 align:start position:0%
this compare them at lunch time with
 
03:52:15.170 --> 03:52:15.180 align:start position:0%
what what she put down and she said oh
 
03:52:17.870 --> 03:52:17.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I guess I left that paragraph out
 
03:52:20.269 --> 03:52:20.279 align:start position:0%
it was the paragraph that established
 
03:52:25.729 --> 03:52:25.739 align:start position:0%
the uh the HHS fund
 
03:52:28.250 --> 03:52:28.260 align:start position:0%
which is kind of important if you're
 
03:52:30.349 --> 03:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
sending the money from somewhere else to
 
03:52:32.030 --> 03:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
that fund but you're using a different
 
03:52:35.450 --> 03:52:35.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:38.170 --> 03:52:38.180 align:start position:0%
okay uh represent I understand
 
03:52:40.490 --> 03:52:40.500 align:start position:0%
representative Almy and I am fully
 
03:52:42.889 --> 03:52:42.899 align:start position:0%
sympathetic but I need a number to put
 
03:52:45.229 --> 03:52:45.239 align:start position:0%
on this sheet for an amendment so I kind
 
03:52:47.510 --> 03:52:47.520 align:start position:0%
of have to wait for them to come back oh
 
03:52:49.070 --> 03:52:49.080 align:start position:0%
dear yeah
 
03:52:52.670 --> 03:52:52.680 align:start position:0%
because she was just going to actually
 
03:52:56.330 --> 03:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
um maybe just send that one page
 
03:52:59.750 --> 03:52:59.760 align:start position:0%
I guess she can't can she
 
03:53:02.690 --> 03:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
well okay Innis could you just summarize
 
03:53:05.809 --> 03:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
what this does yes
 
03:53:05.819 --> 03:53:07.130 align:start position:0%
what this does yes
on

03:53:07.130 --> 03:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:53:09.110 --> 03:53:09.120 align:start position:0%
most of this
 
03:53:12.290 --> 03:53:12.300 align:start position:0%
um well there are two of these
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the way she did this amendment
 
03:53:18.950 --> 03:53:18.960 align:start position:0%
this one is necessary because she if
 
03:53:21.349 --> 03:53:21.359 align:start position:0%
this one passed because she wiped out
 
03:53:27.170 --> 03:53:27.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:30.349 --> 03:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
I don't know why but she she just
 
03:53:33.889 --> 03:53:33.899 align:start position:0%
thought that that that it wasn't needed
 
03:53:38.269 --> 03:53:38.279 align:start position:0%
since the other one was doing it
 
03:53:41.030 --> 03:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
a lot of them are new
 
03:53:44.450 --> 03:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
this year I've noticed
 
03:53:48.590 --> 03:53:48.600 align:start position:0%
okay so so what you're trying to do is
 
03:53:50.210 --> 03:53:50.220 align:start position:0%
there's already a cannabis fund
 
03:53:52.130 --> 03:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
established in the original Bill and
 
03:53:53.929 --> 03:53:53.939 align:start position:0%
you're just trying to send some of that
 
03:53:56.150 --> 03:53:56.160 align:start position:0%
money to something specific is that what
 
03:53:58.309 --> 03:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
you're trying to do no yeah the the
 
03:54:01.670 --> 03:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
amendment no actually not quite because
 
03:54:06.410 --> 03:54:06.420 align:start position:0%
it's not as easy as that but um the one
 
03:54:08.210 --> 03:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
that is
 
03:54:08.220 --> 03:54:08.929 align:start position:0%
that is
um

03:54:08.929 --> 03:54:08.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:10.910 --> 03:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
track changes the one that you're
 
03:54:13.010 --> 03:54:13.020 align:start position:0%
looking at Amendment one that doesn't
 
03:54:16.370 --> 03:54:16.380 align:start position:0%
need any changes at this point
 
03:54:16.380 --> 03:54:17.990 align:start position:0%
need any changes at this point
um

03:54:17.990 --> 03:54:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:20.389 --> 03:54:20.399 align:start position:0%
but what it does
 
03:54:20.399 --> 03:54:21.610 align:start position:0%
but what it does
is

03:54:21.610 --> 03:54:21.620 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:54:24.710 --> 03:54:24.720 align:start position:0%
instead of
 
03:54:27.769 --> 03:54:27.779 align:start position:0%
them asking for the funding that we are
 
03:54:30.469 --> 03:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
now going to get rid of anyway if we
 
03:54:33.429 --> 03:54:33.439 align:start position:0%
vote for representative wrote Sports
 
03:54:37.269 --> 03:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment which I agree with
 
03:54:39.590 --> 03:54:39.600 align:start position:0%
also on
 
03:54:42.349 --> 03:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
except for that
 
03:54:42.359 --> 03:54:45.170 align:start position:0%
except for that
on

03:54:45.170 --> 03:54:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:47.870 --> 03:54:47.880 align:start position:0%
which is in here
 
03:54:47.880 --> 03:54:49.130 align:start position:0%
which is in here
with

03:54:49.130 --> 03:54:49.140 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:54:52.969 --> 03:54:52.979 align:start position:0%
they are trying to Corral back that 700
 
03:54:54.889 --> 03:54:54.899 align:start position:0%
000 to use
 
03:54:59.090 --> 03:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
in here and I left it in there because
 
03:55:03.050 --> 03:55:03.060 align:start position:0%
I didn't know yet whether this one could
 
03:55:03.060 --> 03:55:04.309 align:start position:0%
I didn't know yet whether this one could
pass

03:55:04.309 --> 03:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
pass
 
03:55:04.319 --> 03:55:06.710 align:start position:0%
pass
but

03:55:06.710 --> 03:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:55:08.929 --> 03:55:08.939 align:start position:0%
and those and I've identified those
 
03:55:11.809 --> 03:55:11.819 align:start position:0%
sections so that we can take them out if
 
03:55:14.809 --> 03:55:14.819 align:start position:0%
representative wrote for its bill on
 
03:55:16.729 --> 03:55:16.739 align:start position:0%
Amendment passes
 
03:55:16.739 --> 03:55:17.990 align:start position:0%
Amendment passes
um

03:55:17.990 --> 03:55:18.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:20.330 --> 03:55:20.340 align:start position:0%
the amendment one change of
 
03:55:20.340 --> 03:55:22.010 align:start position:0%
the amendment one change of
Appropriations

03:55:22.010 --> 03:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
Appropriations
 
03:55:24.469 --> 03:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
on does
 
03:55:27.229 --> 03:55:27.239 align:start position:0%
uh two main things
 
03:55:29.229 --> 03:55:29.239 align:start position:0%
it puts
 
03:55:32.389 --> 03:55:32.399 align:start position:0%
on 15 million
 
03:55:36.889 --> 03:55:36.899 align:start position:0%
in a total of 15 million into
 
03:55:40.010 --> 03:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission for purposes of
 
03:55:43.910 --> 03:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
startup of this whole program they gave
 
03:55:47.809 --> 03:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
us a list of their of the expenses that
 
03:55:50.330 --> 03:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
and how they were calculating them last
 
03:55:53.389 --> 03:55:53.399 align:start position:0%
time it's 7 million in the first year
 
03:55:56.030 --> 03:55:56.040 align:start position:0%
and 8 million in the second it's a lot
 
03:55:59.030 --> 03:55:59.040 align:start position:0%
different from what this bill came to us
 
03:56:01.550 --> 03:56:01.560 align:start position:0%
with because at that point they had not
 
03:56:04.550 --> 03:56:04.560 align:start position:0%
yet gone to try to find out how much
 
03:56:06.349 --> 03:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
how much software they were going to
 
03:56:09.830 --> 03:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
need and how much it was going to cost
 
03:56:12.590 --> 03:56:12.600 align:start position:0%
and they do seem to have
 
03:56:15.170 --> 03:56:15.180 align:start position:0%
enough of a handle on that
 
03:56:15.180 --> 03:56:16.429 align:start position:0%
enough of a handle on that
that

03:56:16.429 --> 03:56:16.439 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:56:18.830 --> 03:56:18.840 align:start position:0%
I don't see getting in their way about
 
03:56:21.290 --> 03:56:21.300 align:start position:0%
getting them what they need in order to
 
03:56:23.389 --> 03:56:23.399 align:start position:0%
do this program
 
03:56:25.929 --> 03:56:25.939 align:start position:0%
um they have three separate
 
03:56:29.210 --> 03:56:29.220 align:start position:0%
software packages that they need one of
 
03:56:34.490 --> 03:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
them being seed seed to brownie
 
03:56:39.110 --> 03:56:39.120 align:start position:0%
uh tracking these things and
 
03:56:41.330 --> 03:56:41.340 align:start position:0%
um two of them having to do I think one
 
03:56:43.309 --> 03:56:43.319 align:start position:0%
with with
 
03:56:45.769 --> 03:56:45.779 align:start position:0%
um Workforce and the other one with
 
03:56:49.250 --> 03:56:49.260 align:start position:0%
revenues with uh finances
 
03:56:49.260 --> 03:56:50.630 align:start position:0%
revenues with uh finances
on

03:56:50.630 --> 03:56:50.640 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:56:53.330 --> 03:56:53.340 align:start position:0%
but I need to refresh my memory on that
 
03:56:53.340 --> 03:56:54.110 align:start position:0%
but I need to refresh my memory on that
one

03:56:54.110 --> 03:56:54.120 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:56:54.120 --> 03:56:55.610 align:start position:0%
one
but

03:56:55.610 --> 03:56:55.620 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:56:58.309 --> 03:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
um they said these are very specific to
 
03:56:58.319 --> 03:56:59.450 align:start position:0%
um they said these are very specific to
cannabis

03:56:59.450 --> 03:56:59.460 align:start position:0%
cannabis
 
03:57:03.950 --> 03:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
they told us all that they are
 
03:57:03.960 --> 03:57:05.090 align:start position:0%
they told us all that they are
um

03:57:05.090 --> 03:57:05.100 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:05.100 --> 03:57:07.309 align:start position:0%
um
on

03:57:07.309 --> 03:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
on
 
03:57:09.710 --> 03:57:09.720 align:start position:0%
there are very few vendors that make
 
03:57:12.889 --> 03:57:12.899 align:start position:0%
them they don't expect very many bids
 
03:57:15.710 --> 03:57:15.720 align:start position:0%
and that this that they think that
 
03:57:17.870 --> 03:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to need about four million
 
03:57:20.689 --> 03:57:20.699 align:start position:0%
dollars just for those
 
03:57:23.750 --> 03:57:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh just for those software packages and
 
03:57:26.570 --> 03:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
that they're going to need it I
 
03:57:29.570 --> 03:57:29.580 align:start position:0%
think they said need need the whole
 
03:57:32.030 --> 03:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
fourth million dollars again the second
 
03:57:35.689 --> 03:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
year as the package gets worked into the
 
03:57:38.389 --> 03:57:38.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire context
 
03:57:38.399 --> 03:57:40.670 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire context
and

03:57:40.670 --> 03:57:40.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:57:47.269 --> 03:57:47.279 align:start position:0%
on when we did dra I think we spent
 
03:57:49.610 --> 03:57:49.620 align:start position:0%
5 million the first
 
03:57:54.830 --> 03:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
to first to get data processing fixed
 
03:57:57.710 --> 03:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
and then it was six million more
 
03:58:00.170 --> 03:58:00.180 align:start position:0%
recently to develop the analytic
 
03:58:02.269 --> 03:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
capacity that we now
 
03:58:05.090 --> 03:58:05.100 align:start position:0%
enjoy with dra
 
03:58:08.090 --> 03:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
they are expensive and
 
03:58:08.100 --> 03:58:10.610 align:start position:0%
they are expensive and
so

03:58:10.610 --> 03:58:10.620 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:10.620 --> 03:58:12.170 align:start position:0%
so
so

03:58:12.170 --> 03:58:12.180 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:15.590 --> 03:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
I was doing this with the idea that if
 
03:58:17.929 --> 03:58:17.939 align:start position:0%
we only give them 2 million they can't
 
03:58:20.450 --> 03:58:20.460 align:start position:0%
do anything
 
03:58:20.460 --> 03:58:22.729 align:start position:0%
do anything
so

03:58:22.729 --> 03:58:22.739 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:58:25.969 --> 03:58:25.979 align:start position:0%
that the 2 million is approximately what
 
03:58:28.910 --> 03:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
they think they're going to need
 
03:58:28.920 --> 03:58:29.750 align:start position:0%
they think they're going to need
um

03:58:29.750 --> 03:58:29.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:58:32.870 --> 03:58:32.880 align:start position:0%
need for the staff
 
03:58:36.229 --> 03:58:36.239 align:start position:0%
Ing and they'll need more of it the
 
03:58:37.790 --> 03:58:37.800 align:start position:0%
second year than the first because
 
03:58:40.969 --> 03:58:40.979 align:start position:0%
they'll be getting ready for the
 
03:58:43.189 --> 03:58:43.199 align:start position:0%
continuing project which they estimated
 
03:58:45.889 --> 03:58:45.899 align:start position:0%
to us is going to cost about four
 
03:58:50.570 --> 03:58:50.580 align:start position:0%
million two I think uh
 
03:58:55.010 --> 03:58:55.020 align:start position:0%
on each each year of operation
 
03:58:57.769 --> 03:58:57.779 align:start position:0%
and they do have to
 
03:59:01.070 --> 03:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
do testing and on all those little Farms
 
03:59:02.689 --> 03:59:02.699 align:start position:0%
people are going to be allowed to set up
 
03:59:07.309 --> 03:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
as well as the big big outfits
 
03:59:10.309 --> 03:59:10.319 align:start position:0%
or oversee the testing at any rate make
 
03:59:14.090 --> 03:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
sure that go test the testers
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
um they're going to have to be going to
 
03:59:19.370 --> 03:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
all the retail establishments and all of
 
03:59:19.380 --> 03:59:20.330 align:start position:0%
all the retail establishments and all of
the

03:59:20.330 --> 03:59:20.340 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:59:20.340 --> 03:59:21.950 align:start position:0%
the
the

03:59:21.950 --> 03:59:21.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:59:21.960 --> 03:59:23.710 align:start position:0%
the
wholesale

03:59:23.710 --> 03:59:23.720 align:start position:0%
wholesale
 
03:59:26.570 --> 03:59:26.580 align:start position:0%
establishments on a fairly regular basis
 
03:59:29.750 --> 03:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
in the wholesale establishments
 
03:59:32.090 --> 03:59:32.100 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:59:34.729 --> 03:59:34.739 align:start position:0%
they may be padding that some
 
03:59:37.130 --> 03:59:37.140 align:start position:0%
and it'd be something that we could push
 
03:59:38.689 --> 03:59:38.699 align:start position:0%
back on later
 
03:59:41.389 --> 03:59:41.399 align:start position:0%
but I was just taking
 
03:59:43.729 --> 03:59:43.739 align:start position:0%
what they came up with
 
03:59:48.950 --> 03:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
as as the idea the 4.2 does not show up
 
03:59:52.269 --> 03:59:52.279 align:start position:0%
in here because under the bill
 
03:59:55.610 --> 03:59:55.620 align:start position:0%
once they are actually selling stuff
 
03:59:59.150 --> 03:59:59.160 align:start position:0%
some stuff and getting Revenue in
 
04:00:03.170 --> 04:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
from licenses they're going to have to
 
04:00:03.180 --> 04:00:05.570 align:start position:0%
from licenses they're going to have to
apply

04:00:05.570 --> 04:00:05.580 align:start position:0%
apply
 
04:00:10.729 --> 04:00:10.739 align:start position:0%
they they will take the 4.2 out of that
 
04:00:13.490 --> 04:00:13.500 align:start position:0%
which leaves it pretty low the first
 
04:00:15.830 --> 04:00:15.840 align:start position:0%
first year if they took all of it but
 
04:00:17.809 --> 04:00:17.819 align:start position:0%
probably they'd stretch it out over a
 
04:00:19.729 --> 04:00:19.739 align:start position:0%
couple of years
 
04:00:21.349 --> 04:00:21.359 align:start position:0%
um well they're going to have to stretch
 
04:00:23.510 --> 04:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
out the 15 million over a couple years
 
04:00:25.070 --> 04:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
at least
 
04:00:25.080 --> 04:00:26.750 align:start position:0%
at least
so

04:00:26.750 --> 04:00:26.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:00:26.760 --> 04:00:27.469 align:start position:0%
so
um

04:00:27.469 --> 04:00:27.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:31.130 --> 04:00:31.140 align:start position:0%
that's what what that part of it does
 
04:00:35.450 --> 04:00:35.460 align:start position:0%
the second and it's in two parts because
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
I was trying to originally in finance
 
04:00:41.330 --> 04:00:41.340 align:start position:0%
and they always have the Appropriations
 
04:00:43.210 --> 04:00:43.220 align:start position:0%
at the end
 
04:00:45.769 --> 04:00:45.779 align:start position:0%
even if they're also somewhere in the
 
04:00:45.779 --> 04:00:47.630 align:start position:0%
even if they're also somewhere in the
middle

04:00:47.630 --> 04:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
middle
 
04:00:49.610 --> 04:00:49.620 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:00:53.630 --> 04:00:53.640 align:start position:0%
the second on the the last appropriation
 
04:00:56.990 --> 04:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
on in that first section is the
 
04:00:59.090 --> 04:00:59.100 align:start position:0%
substance use prevention and Recovery
 
04:01:01.370 --> 04:01:01.380 align:start position:0%
Fund from HHS
 
04:01:04.189 --> 04:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
on which
 
04:01:04.199 --> 04:01:05.630 align:start position:0%
on which
wants

04:01:05.630 --> 04:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
wants
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
money up front before we start getting
 
04:01:13.010 --> 04:01:13.020 align:start position:0%
money in for public education campaign
 
04:01:16.309 --> 04:01:16.319 align:start position:0%
before the sales start
 
04:01:18.769 --> 04:01:18.779 align:start position:0%
so that people will know who's supposed
 
04:01:18.779 --> 04:01:20.630 align:start position:0%
so that people will know who's supposed
who

04:01:20.630 --> 04:01:20.640 align:start position:0%
who
 
04:01:23.929 --> 04:01:23.939 align:start position:0%
who should avoid trying to to use
 
04:01:26.330 --> 04:01:26.340 align:start position:0%
marijuana at all because it might be bad
 
04:01:29.889 --> 04:01:29.899 align:start position:0%
for the illnesses they've got or
 
04:01:33.530 --> 04:01:33.540 align:start position:0%
genetics that they've got and
 
04:01:33.540 --> 04:01:34.610 align:start position:0%
genetics that they've got and
um

04:01:34.610 --> 04:01:34.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:36.950 --> 04:01:36.960 align:start position:0%
and um
 
04:01:38.870 --> 04:01:38.880 align:start position:0%
how much
 
04:01:38.880 --> 04:01:41.269 align:start position:0%
how much
on

04:01:41.269 --> 04:01:41.279 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:01:44.809 --> 04:01:44.819 align:start position:0%
how much on is a high dose of marijuana
 
04:01:47.630 --> 04:01:47.640 align:start position:0%
versus a low dose of marijuana so that
 
04:01:50.150 --> 04:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
you don't get people experimenting that
 
04:01:52.370 --> 04:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
have never tried marijuana before at the
 
04:01:54.349 --> 04:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
highest level and just going off the
 
04:01:54.359 --> 04:01:55.370 align:start position:0%
highest level and just going off the
edge

04:01:55.370 --> 04:01:55.380 align:start position:0%
edge
 
04:01:58.189 --> 04:01:58.199 align:start position:0%
which happened in Colorado
 
04:01:59.750 --> 04:01:59.760 align:start position:0%
at the beginning
 
04:02:01.910 --> 04:02:01.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:02:04.070 --> 04:02:04.080 align:start position:0%
they wanted the seven hundred thousand
 
04:02:06.469 --> 04:02:06.479 align:start position:0%
dollars I put it down at five hundred
 
04:02:08.210 --> 04:02:08.220 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars they seem to be okay
 
04:02:09.889 --> 04:02:09.899 align:start position:0%
with that
 
04:02:12.530 --> 04:02:12.540 align:start position:0%
or at least Hope was okay with that he
 
04:02:15.650 --> 04:02:15.660 align:start position:0%
sent me an email this morning
 
04:02:17.990 --> 04:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
when he got back to work
 
04:02:21.590 --> 04:02:21.600 align:start position:0%
so the second part of at section 33
 
04:02:25.070 --> 04:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
amendments is just saying okay the 15
 
04:02:27.290 --> 04:02:27.300 align:start position:0%
million seven million is in the first
 
04:02:29.809 --> 04:02:29.819 align:start position:0%
year of the biennium and 8 million is in
 
04:02:34.790 --> 04:02:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:34.800 --> 04:02:41.870 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:02:41.870 --> 04:02:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:44.210 --> 04:02:44.220 align:start position:0%
and I think
 
04:02:47.210 --> 04:02:47.220 align:start position:0%
and and that the 500
 
04:02:50.150 --> 04:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
000 is for the buying
 
04:02:54.889 --> 04:02:54.899 align:start position:0%
now all of that has attached to it
 
04:02:54.899 --> 04:02:55.729 align:start position:0%
now all of that has attached to it
um

04:02:55.729 --> 04:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:02:55.739 --> 04:02:56.990 align:start position:0%
um
in

04:02:56.990 --> 04:02:57.000 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:03:02.150 --> 04:03:02.160 align:start position:0%
in the first part in 3 3 18 21.
 
04:03:02.160 --> 04:03:05.870 align:start position:0%
in the first part in 3 3 18 21.
on

04:03:05.870 --> 04:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:09.110 --> 04:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
the the sum is appropriated to the
 
04:03:13.189 --> 04:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
Cannabis commission for for x and said
 
04:03:16.670 --> 04:03:16.680 align:start position:0%
Son shall be a charge against the fund
 
04:03:19.790 --> 04:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
which means that when they start getting
 
04:03:23.090 --> 04:03:23.100 align:start position:0%
in profits part of the profits has to go
 
04:03:25.610 --> 04:03:25.620 align:start position:0%
back until they finish paying off the 15
 
04:03:29.809 --> 04:03:29.819 align:start position:0%
million and the 500 000.
 
04:03:31.429 --> 04:03:31.439 align:start position:0%
from the different the two different
 
04:03:31.439 --> 04:03:34.250 align:start position:0%
from the different the two different
funds

04:03:34.250 --> 04:03:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:38.210 --> 04:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
so that that's the Appropriations one
 
04:03:41.570 --> 04:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
okay so that's one potential amendment
 
04:03:43.670 --> 04:03:43.680 align:start position:0%
that you have now at OLS
 
04:03:46.370 --> 04:03:46.380 align:start position:0%
well that Amendment
 
04:03:50.510 --> 04:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
is probably the way it has to be uh from
 
04:03:58.729 --> 04:03:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:01.429 --> 04:04:01.439 align:start position:0%
that one is here okay okay so let's pass
 
04:04:03.769 --> 04:04:03.779 align:start position:0%
that out and then uh we'll ask
 
04:04:05.630 --> 04:04:05.640 align:start position:0%
representative all me any clarifying
 
04:04:07.130 --> 04:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
questions we have and then do a straw
 
04:04:10.070 --> 04:04:10.080 align:start position:0%
poll on that yeah can you clarify what's
 
04:04:12.229 --> 04:04:12.239 align:start position:0%
being passed around is it part one or
 
04:04:15.710 --> 04:04:15.720 align:start position:0%
part two it's uh
 
04:04:20.210 --> 04:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:24.050 --> 04:04:24.060 align:start position:0%
yes it is except that
 
04:04:26.990 --> 04:04:27.000 align:start position:0%
when they did the drafting I don't know
 
04:04:29.210 --> 04:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
how they decide sometimes we're just
 
04:04:32.530 --> 04:04:32.540 align:start position:0%
going to amend sections three and four
 
04:04:35.269 --> 04:04:35.279 align:start position:0%
of of
 
04:04:37.729 --> 04:04:37.739 align:start position:0%
this part of the bill
 
04:04:39.830 --> 04:04:39.840 align:start position:0%
and when they decide okay we're
 
04:04:42.469 --> 04:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
rewriting the whole thing they rewrote
 
04:04:45.349 --> 04:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
the whole I did not I asked just to
 
04:04:48.710 --> 04:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
change those sections they re rewrote
 
04:04:52.010 --> 04:04:52.020 align:start position:0%
the whole bill which means that the
 
04:04:52.020 --> 04:04:53.750 align:start position:0%
the whole bill which means that the
pre-spilsbury

04:04:53.750 --> 04:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
pre-spilsbury
 
04:04:53.760 --> 04:04:55.070 align:start position:0%
pre-spilsbury
uh

04:04:55.070 --> 04:04:55.080 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:04:59.689 --> 04:04:59.699 align:start position:0%
model for how the the distribution goes
 
04:05:03.410 --> 04:05:03.420 align:start position:0%
is in there intact so that has to come
 
04:05:07.010 --> 04:05:07.020 align:start position:0%
out if this amendment and that Amendment
 
04:05:08.809 --> 04:05:08.819 align:start position:0%
are passed
 
04:05:08.819 --> 04:05:11.510 align:start position:0%
are passed
thanks

04:05:11.510 --> 04:05:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:13.189 --> 04:05:13.199 align:start position:0%
Madam chair that would happen if we
 
04:05:15.050 --> 04:05:15.060 align:start position:0%
passed the Omni Amendment first and then
 
04:05:18.290 --> 04:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
the uh and later the uh well the
 
04:05:20.510 --> 04:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
roachford amendment and then thirdly the
 
04:05:22.729 --> 04:05:22.739 align:start position:0%
spillsbury amendment that this Pillsbury
 
04:05:24.769 --> 04:05:24.779 align:start position:0%
member wind up lasting right maybe I'll
 
04:05:32.510 --> 04:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:37.689 --> 04:05:37.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:40.250 --> 04:05:40.260 align:start position:0%
this is just the Cannabis fund but
 
04:05:43.610 --> 04:05:43.620 align:start position:0%
anything else that did the Cannabis fund
 
04:05:46.610 --> 04:05:46.620 align:start position:0%
it's going to have to
 
04:05:49.010 --> 04:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to know the order in
 
04:05:51.650 --> 04:05:51.660 align:start position:0%
which these were were done in order to
 
04:05:53.510 --> 04:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
know what comes out and what stays in
 
04:05:55.610 --> 04:05:55.620 align:start position:0%
that's the clerk's job that's the
 
04:05:58.309 --> 04:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
clerk's job but also on
 
04:06:00.290 --> 04:06:00.300 align:start position:0%
we need to make really careful this
 
04:06:02.689 --> 04:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
comes out outright and
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
okay so where where is the appropriation
 
04:06:07.910 --> 04:06:07.920 align:start position:0%
for like even the 500 000 in here I
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
don't even see that I could be blind
 
04:06:16.729 --> 04:06:16.739 align:start position:0%
on it's page one and section um line 16
 
04:06:24.550 --> 04:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:06:29.150 --> 04:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
are you looking at 12 23
 
04:06:31.550 --> 04:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
yeah uh no you aren't no I'm looking at
 
04:06:34.809 --> 04:06:34.819 align:start position:0%
12 24. yeah
 
04:06:40.610 --> 04:06:40.620 align:start position:0%
oh did I pass out the wrong one oh shoot
 
04:06:40.620 --> 04:06:41.809 align:start position:0%
oh did I pass out the wrong one oh shoot
here

04:06:41.809 --> 04:06:41.819 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:06:46.309 --> 04:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
yeah 1224 is is more complicated
 
04:06:47.830 --> 04:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
wait a minute
 
04:06:49.570 --> 04:06:49.580 align:start position:0%
no no
 
04:06:51.410 --> 04:06:51.420 align:start position:0%
did I
 
04:06:51.420 --> 04:06:55.189 align:start position:0%
did I
um

04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:00.250 --> 04:07:00.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:14.030 --> 04:07:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:17.110 --> 04:07:17.120 align:start position:0%
I do apologize
 
04:07:21.349 --> 04:07:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:24.290 --> 04:07:24.300 align:start position:0%
12 24 is the one that has a paragraph
 
04:07:24.300 --> 04:07:27.729 align:start position:0%
12 24 is the one that has a paragraph
missing

04:07:27.729 --> 04:07:27.739 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:29.830 --> 04:07:29.840 align:start position:0%
no no
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
because she might only send back the one
 
04:07:32.520 --> 04:07:35.330 align:start position:0%
because she might only send back the one
page

04:07:35.330 --> 04:07:35.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:07:37.490 --> 04:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay well there's obviously several
 
04:07:39.889 --> 04:07:39.899 align:start position:0%
different sections to this but in in a
 
04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
nutshell we are dramatically increasing
 
04:07:44.510 --> 04:07:44.520 align:start position:0%
the amount of money we're putting aside
 
04:07:47.330 --> 04:07:47.340 align:start position:0%
under this bill which is pretty big and
 
04:07:49.969 --> 04:07:49.979 align:start position:0%
I did miss a lot of the work sessions so
 
04:07:52.729 --> 04:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
I I didn't hear what the commission
 
04:07:55.910 --> 04:07:55.920 align:start position:0%
liquor said about this
 
04:07:57.950 --> 04:07:57.960 align:start position:0%
um was this something they asked for of
 
04:08:00.950 --> 04:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
the committee they gave us a sheet with
 
04:08:03.229 --> 04:08:03.239 align:start position:0%
all their expenses and they said said we
 
04:08:06.349 --> 04:08:06.359 align:start position:0%
need this in order to proceed
 
04:08:08.090 --> 04:08:08.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure where my copy of the
 
04:08:09.250 --> 04:08:09.260 align:start position:0%
sheet is
 
04:08:12.950 --> 04:08:12.960 align:start position:0%
the police representative help us
 
04:08:14.929 --> 04:08:14.939 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair So based on the
 
04:08:16.969 --> 04:08:16.979 align:start position:0%
notes that I took
 
04:08:19.910 --> 04:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
um at the last committee meeting
 
04:08:21.889 --> 04:08:21.899 align:start position:0%
the commission said in the first year
 
04:08:24.250 --> 04:08:24.260 align:start position:0%
they would need seven million dollars
 
04:08:27.290 --> 04:08:27.300 align:start position:0%
and 5 million of that was for the
 
04:08:29.929 --> 04:08:29.939 align:start position:0%
systems that they were gonna what's that
 
04:08:32.150 --> 04:08:32.160 align:start position:0%
yeah five million uh for the systems
 
04:08:33.170 --> 04:08:33.180 align:start position:0%
that they're going to be putting in
 
04:08:37.210 --> 04:08:37.220 align:start position:0%
place uh before this the um the other
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
two million was for a combination of
 
04:08:42.050 --> 04:08:42.060 align:start position:0%
Office Space
 
04:08:46.910 --> 04:08:46.920 align:start position:0%
uh Construction office furniture cars
 
04:08:49.729 --> 04:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
and payroll
 
04:08:52.490 --> 04:08:52.500 align:start position:0%
right salaries and benefits so that that
 
04:08:54.530 --> 04:08:54.540 align:start position:0%
was 2 million and then 5 million again
 
04:08:56.990 --> 04:08:57.000 align:start position:0%
for the system the second year
 
04:09:01.130 --> 04:09:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:07.429 --> 04:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:08.929 --> 04:09:08.939 align:start position:0%
actually I don't have much more than
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
that so the second year they wanted
 
04:09:12.170 --> 04:09:12.180 align:start position:0%
eight million presumably you know the
 
04:09:12.180 --> 04:09:15.170 align:start position:0%
eight million presumably you know the
the

04:09:15.170 --> 04:09:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:16.849 --> 04:09:16.859 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing that you know when I look
 
04:09:18.410 --> 04:09:18.420 align:start position:0%
at the jump to the third year they
 
04:09:21.170 --> 04:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
needed 4.2 million they're fully staffed
 
04:09:24.170 --> 04:09:24.180 align:start position:0%
and they need to maintain the systems so
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
my guess is part of that eight million
 
04:09:28.910 --> 04:09:28.920 align:start position:0%
do you have it here yeah this is
 
04:09:34.910 --> 04:09:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:38.030 --> 04:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
well three so in the second year three
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
million is
 
04:09:43.250 --> 04:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
um office costs startup costs and five
 
04:09:45.950 --> 04:09:45.960 align:start position:0%
million oh I see so the licensing the
 
04:09:47.450 --> 04:09:47.460 align:start position:0%
system was 5 million in the first year
 
04:09:48.889 --> 04:09:48.899 align:start position:0%
as I said
 
04:09:51.769 --> 04:09:51.779 align:start position:0%
another 5 million in the second year
 
04:09:53.269 --> 04:09:53.279 align:start position:0%
um probably because of implementation
 
04:09:55.610 --> 04:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
and Consulting costs and then the third
 
04:09:57.710 --> 04:09:57.720 align:start position:0%
year was just was just
 
04:09:59.269 --> 04:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
um a million
 
04:10:02.870 --> 04:10:02.880 align:start position:0%
um for ongoing system maintenance
 
04:10:05.570 --> 04:10:05.580 align:start position:0%
so so to recap first year they said
 
04:10:07.189 --> 04:10:07.199 align:start position:0%
seven million second year eight million
 
04:10:09.530 --> 04:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
third year four point two million
 
04:10:12.290 --> 04:10:12.300 align:start position:0%
so does this amendment address what was
 
04:10:16.429 --> 04:10:16.439 align:start position:0%
said as yes okay
 
04:10:18.849 --> 04:10:18.859 align:start position:0%
so we're again we're in a work session
 
04:10:22.130 --> 04:10:22.140 align:start position:0%
there's no more clarifying questions
 
04:10:24.349 --> 04:10:24.359 align:start position:0%
how many people
 
04:10:27.010 --> 04:10:27.020 align:start position:0%
support Amendment
 
04:10:41.170 --> 04:10:41.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:44.889 --> 04:10:44.899 align:start position:0%
how many are posts
 
04:10:47.630 --> 04:10:47.640 align:start position:0%
anybody opposed I only have 16 people
 
04:10:50.269 --> 04:10:50.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:52.429 --> 04:10:52.439 align:start position:0%
looks like we're all here at the moment
 
04:10:55.150 --> 04:10:55.160 align:start position:0%
some people apparently didn't vote
 
04:10:57.769 --> 04:10:57.779 align:start position:0%
okay so the strong majority of people
 
04:10:59.269 --> 04:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
are okay with this because you guys
 
04:11:01.309 --> 04:11:01.319 align:start position:0%
heard the Liquor Commission wanted it so
 
04:11:05.510 --> 04:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay there we go okay second one with
 
04:11:07.990 --> 04:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
the exception of
 
04:11:11.389 --> 04:11:11.399 align:start position:0%
sections uh
 
04:11:15.910 --> 04:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
of section Romans 6 which is the part
 
04:11:22.969 --> 04:11:22.979 align:start position:0%
that this Pillsbury Amendment so this
 
04:11:25.790 --> 04:11:25.800 align:start position:0%
will be redrafted so that it doesn't
 
04:11:31.309 --> 04:11:31.319 align:start position:0%
trip over and undo arama okay so can you
 
04:11:33.050 --> 04:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
just make notes on your copy on what
 
04:11:35.389 --> 04:11:35.399 align:start position:0%
really needs to change there so uh we'll
 
04:11:36.830 --> 04:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
have to think about this maybe in the
 
04:11:38.870 --> 04:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
order of operations when we go to exact
 
04:11:41.990 --> 04:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
session we do this first we do the
 
04:11:43.969 --> 04:11:43.979 align:start position:0%
roachford amendment next
 
04:11:46.189 --> 04:11:46.199 align:start position:0%
and then we do the spillsbury amendment
 
04:11:50.510 --> 04:11:50.520 align:start position:0%
Okay so good now we'll go back to I
 
04:11:52.130 --> 04:11:52.140 align:start position:0%
would ask we do it the other way around
 
04:11:54.769 --> 04:11:54.779 align:start position:0%
let's get the foundation of all of the
 
04:11:57.469 --> 04:11:57.479 align:start position:0%
broad consensus we had
 
04:11:58.969 --> 04:11:58.979 align:start position:0%
and then
 
04:12:02.330 --> 04:12:02.340 align:start position:0%
modify that okay uh is that okay what
 
04:12:04.010 --> 04:12:04.020 align:start position:0%
does it matter what order we take up the
 
04:12:10.189 --> 04:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:10.199 --> 04:12:18.590 align:start position:0%
 
gotcha

04:12:18.590 --> 04:12:18.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:18.600 --> 04:12:20.030 align:start position:0%
 
class

04:12:20.030 --> 04:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
class
 
04:12:27.710 --> 04:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:27.720 --> 04:12:29.090 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:12:29.090 --> 04:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:12:32.689 --> 04:12:32.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:35.570 --> 04:12:35.580 align:start position:0%
so that they can be combined into one
 
04:12:43.689 --> 04:12:43.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:46.849 --> 04:12:46.859 align:start position:0%
good so we're we're going to end up with
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
the same result
 
04:12:53.450 --> 04:12:53.460 align:start position:0%
um because OLS is restating all of
 
04:12:58.250 --> 04:12:58.260 align:start position:0%
section 7 which runs page three to 22
 
04:13:01.910 --> 04:13:01.920 align:start position:0%
inclusive so one supersedes the other oh
 
04:13:04.729 --> 04:13:04.739 align:start position:0%
whichever order you do it
 
04:13:07.490 --> 04:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
so whichever order we do it we've got a
 
04:13:08.929 --> 04:13:08.939 align:start position:0%
problem that we got rid of something
 
04:13:13.490 --> 04:13:13.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:15.290 --> 04:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
effectively this amendment I think needs
 
04:13:17.090 --> 04:13:17.100 align:start position:0%
to be trimmed
 
04:13:20.269 --> 04:13:20.279 align:start position:0%
ideally yeah okay
 
04:13:23.269 --> 04:13:23.279 align:start position:0%
so you could go back to OLS and trim
 
04:13:24.769 --> 04:13:24.779 align:start position:0%
this back
 
04:13:24.779 --> 04:13:27.590 align:start position:0%
this back
yeah what

04:13:27.590 --> 04:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:30.170 --> 04:13:30.180 align:start position:0%
what I was hoping we could do is that
 
04:13:33.650 --> 04:13:33.660 align:start position:0%
two of us at least could go to OLS
 
04:13:33.660 --> 04:13:35.030 align:start position:0%
two of us at least could go to OLS
together

04:13:35.030 --> 04:13:35.040 align:start position:0%
together
 
04:13:38.570 --> 04:13:38.580 align:start position:0%
uh and make sure that they take the
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
parts that we want and not the parts we
 
04:13:44.150 --> 04:13:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't want yep
 
04:13:47.150 --> 04:13:47.160 align:start position:0%
would that work
 
04:13:50.650 --> 04:13:50.660 align:start position:0%
we could come up with one Amendment
 
04:13:53.030 --> 04:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
ideally can come up with one amendment
 
04:13:55.130 --> 04:13:55.140 align:start position:0%
that you all agree to because we both
 
04:13:56.630 --> 04:13:56.640 align:start position:0%
guess that okay well let's keep moving
 
04:13:59.389 --> 04:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
on and we can maybe Quicken this up a
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
little bit just to see what amendments
 
04:14:02.990 --> 04:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
do we have and then we go to maybe two
 
04:14:05.330 --> 04:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
of you go to OLS and say this is what we
 
04:14:07.670 --> 04:14:07.680 align:start position:0%
want but and tell them where the fixes
 
04:14:08.990 --> 04:14:09.000 align:start position:0%
are and when we put it together so we
 
04:14:12.110 --> 04:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
end up with one committee Amendment but
 
04:14:14.150 --> 04:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
at least we'll have votes on the
 
04:14:16.670 --> 04:14:16.680 align:start position:0%
individual amendments here
 
04:14:20.570 --> 04:14:20.580 align:start position:0%
well no should we have to do that first
 
04:14:24.889 --> 04:14:24.899 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:27.349 --> 04:14:27.359 align:start position:0%
yeah okay so we have a stravo con
 
04:14:28.370 --> 04:14:28.380 align:start position:0%
conceptually we agree with that
 
04:14:30.110 --> 04:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
representative lippley
 
04:14:32.929 --> 04:14:32.939 align:start position:0%
um I don't think we ever voted on
 
04:14:36.290 --> 04:14:36.300 align:start position:0%
representative Rose Schertz okay I just
 
04:14:37.610 --> 04:14:37.620 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're that's the
 
04:14:37.620 --> 04:14:38.650 align:start position:0%
want to make sure we're that's the
problem

04:14:38.650 --> 04:14:38.660 align:start position:0%
problem
 
04:14:41.389 --> 04:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
so well we can do that now if that would
 
04:14:43.250 --> 04:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
help because we all know what that is
 
04:14:45.469 --> 04:14:45.479 align:start position:0%
representative on me if we could I'd
 
04:14:47.210 --> 04:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
just like to
 
04:14:50.389 --> 04:14:50.399 align:start position:0%
correct the parts that need to come out
 
04:14:54.469 --> 04:14:54.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:59.030 --> 04:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
because I had if we take out all of six
 
04:15:01.370 --> 04:15:01.380 align:start position:0%
we've taken out the appropriation for
 
04:15:09.410 --> 04:15:09.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:13.969 --> 04:15:13.979 align:start position:0%
but then f everything after that
 
04:15:18.170 --> 04:15:18.180 align:start position:0%
in that section is is replaced by this
 
04:15:20.210 --> 04:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
buildsbury amendment
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
or did the spilsbury amendment have the
 
04:15:22.439 --> 04:15:25.150 align:start position:0%
or did the spilsbury amendment have the
hundred

04:15:25.150 --> 04:15:25.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:26.809 --> 04:15:26.819 align:start position:0%
million 100
 
04:15:28.010 --> 04:15:28.020 align:start position:0%
000 in it
 
04:15:30.950 --> 04:15:30.960 align:start position:0%
yeah okay yeah
 
04:15:37.130 --> 04:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:39.410 --> 04:15:39.420 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:15:43.010 --> 04:15:43.020 align:start position:0%
I on page two of the amendment here it
 
04:15:45.050 --> 04:15:45.060 align:start position:0%
says eighty percent shall be dispersed
 
04:15:46.790 --> 04:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
to the education trust fund that's what
 
04:15:48.650 --> 04:15:48.660 align:start position:0%
I was just talking about that's the
 
04:15:51.290 --> 04:15:51.300 align:start position:0%
spilsbury amendment I mean that is not
 
04:15:52.670 --> 04:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
the spillsbury amendment that's what
 
04:15:54.110 --> 04:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
they're immense he's a man they're
 
04:15:58.490 --> 04:15:58.500 align:start position:0%
amending thank you sorry yeah so where
 
04:16:00.290 --> 04:16:00.300 align:start position:0%
yeah so that exact part is going to have
 
04:16:02.210 --> 04:16:02.220 align:start position:0%
to come out so we're doing straw votes
 
04:16:04.370 --> 04:16:04.380 align:start position:0%
on four or five different things once we
 
04:16:05.929 --> 04:16:05.939 align:start position:0%
think we've got the consensus of the
 
04:16:08.510 --> 04:16:08.520 align:start position:0%
majority then representative almi and
 
04:16:10.689 --> 04:16:10.699 align:start position:0%
representative spilsbury will go to OLS
 
04:16:13.189 --> 04:16:13.199 align:start position:0%
merge these together take out the
 
04:16:14.870 --> 04:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
conflicting language
 
04:16:17.570 --> 04:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
and come back to us for a final fabulous
 
04:16:17.580 --> 04:16:19.450 align:start position:0%
and come back to us for a final fabulous
vote

04:16:19.450 --> 04:16:19.460 align:start position:0%
vote
 
04:16:22.189 --> 04:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
that's going to be today okay so now
 
04:16:24.110 --> 04:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
we're going back let's look at
 
04:16:26.809 --> 04:16:26.819 align:start position:0%
representative rochford's Amendment so
 
04:16:28.849 --> 04:16:28.859 align:start position:0%
we can just see if we have a straw vote
 
04:16:30.950 --> 04:16:30.960 align:start position:0%
on that because that if we don't take
 
04:16:32.929 --> 04:16:32.939 align:start position:0%
that up then that changes things too
 
04:16:35.929 --> 04:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
yeah right
 
04:16:38.030 --> 04:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
everyone remember so that's uh Amendment
 
04:16:38.040 --> 04:16:43.429 align:start position:0%
everyone remember so that's uh Amendment
1217

04:16:43.429 --> 04:16:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:45.110 --> 04:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
that was the one we did right before the
 
04:16:47.330 --> 04:16:47.340 align:start position:0%
lunch break which has to do with
 
04:16:50.510 --> 04:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
removing those huge upfront
 
04:16:52.849 --> 04:16:52.859 align:start position:0%
application fees and licenses is that
 
04:16:52.859 --> 04:16:53.870 align:start position:0%
application fees and licenses is that
correct

04:16:53.870 --> 04:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
correct
 
04:16:57.410 --> 04:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
Madam chair can you remind us
 
04:16:59.570 --> 04:16:59.580 align:start position:0%
um where we were when we took lunch I
 
04:17:03.290 --> 04:17:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:07.130 --> 04:17:07.140 align:start position:0%
did we say 13.5 uh no so on a different
 
04:17:11.830 --> 04:17:11.840 align:start position:0%
Amendment we had a 13-7 vote on a 12.5
 
04:17:15.170 --> 04:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
on the thank you wholesale that's what I
 
04:17:17.870 --> 04:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
was looking for thank you okay
 
04:17:20.450 --> 04:17:20.460 align:start position:0%
okay so everyone got The Roaster
 
04:17:21.950 --> 04:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of them
 
04:17:24.349 --> 04:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
can I ask a question yes
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
um so I agree with the thought behind
 
04:17:29.330 --> 04:17:29.340 align:start position:0%
this and I think one of the things that
 
04:17:31.189 --> 04:17:31.199 align:start position:0%
we've heard is important is to lower the
 
04:17:34.309 --> 04:17:34.319 align:start position:0%
barriers right upstart startup barriers
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
and this is very clearly like let's put
 
04:17:39.469 --> 04:17:39.479 align:start position:0%
this up front before you can even do
 
04:17:41.809 --> 04:17:41.819 align:start position:0%
anything so I would agree with taking it
 
04:17:41.819 --> 04:17:43.309 align:start position:0%
anything so I would agree with taking it
out

04:17:43.309 --> 04:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:17:45.410 --> 04:17:45.420 align:start position:0%
um my only concern being that you know
 
04:17:48.469 --> 04:17:48.479 align:start position:0%
that changes the numbers would we would
 
04:17:53.030 --> 04:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
we be willing to discuss
 
04:17:55.070 --> 04:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
kind of evening out the three different
 
04:17:57.889 --> 04:17:57.899 align:start position:0%
sets of numbers that we've discussed by
 
04:18:00.469 --> 04:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
revisiting the 12.5 I guess is my
 
04:18:00.479 --> 04:18:03.070 align:start position:0%
revisiting the 12.5 I guess is my
question

04:18:03.070 --> 04:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:05.450 --> 04:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
I think that's addressed with
 
04:18:07.910 --> 04:18:07.920 align:start position:0%
Representatives almi's Amendment if I
 
04:18:09.349 --> 04:18:09.359 align:start position:0%
got that right would that appropriate
 
04:18:12.110 --> 04:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
that initial appropriation
 
04:18:14.269 --> 04:18:14.279 align:start position:0%
um I believe that's what we talked about
 
04:18:17.150 --> 04:18:17.160 align:start position:0%
with the gentleman from HHS prior to
 
04:18:17.160 --> 04:18:19.070 align:start position:0%
with the gentleman from HHS prior to
lunch

04:18:19.070 --> 04:18:19.080 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
04:18:19.080 --> 04:18:20.450 align:start position:0%
lunch
um

04:18:20.450 --> 04:18:20.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:18:22.969 --> 04:18:22.979 align:start position:0%
five hundred thousand yes five hundred
 
04:18:26.269 --> 04:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
thousand yes so uh
 
04:18:30.170 --> 04:18:30.180 align:start position:0%
eliminating the the fees
 
04:18:34.849 --> 04:18:34.859 align:start position:0%
is the the the the the makeup is in that
 
04:18:37.969 --> 04:18:37.979 align:start position:0%
amendment that she has proposed where we
 
04:18:41.210 --> 04:18:41.220 align:start position:0%
get the 500 000 appropriation can can I
 
04:18:42.469 --> 04:18:42.479 align:start position:0%
say this out loud so I make sure I'm
 
04:18:44.510 --> 04:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
getting it right so my understanding was
 
04:18:47.330 --> 04:18:47.340 align:start position:0%
your amendment was
 
04:18:50.269 --> 04:18:50.279 align:start position:0%
we were taking out
 
04:18:52.670 --> 04:18:52.680 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire would not receive seven
 
04:18:54.889 --> 04:18:54.899 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars
 
04:18:57.950 --> 04:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
um and the amendment that representative
 
04:18:59.750 --> 04:18:59.760 align:start position:0%
almi is proposing is actually New
 
04:19:01.550 --> 04:19:01.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is spending five hundred
 
04:19:04.250 --> 04:19:04.260 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars to educate folks so
 
04:19:08.030 --> 04:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
that is a net 1.2 million dollars
 
04:19:10.910 --> 04:19:10.920 align:start position:0%
of less Revenue than we had when we
 
04:19:13.490 --> 04:19:13.500 align:start position:0%
voted on the 12.5 percent I just was
 
04:19:15.950 --> 04:19:15.960 align:start position:0%
wondering if we could revisit and maybe
 
04:19:19.070 --> 04:19:19.080 align:start position:0%
do some corrections
 
04:19:21.710 --> 04:19:21.720 align:start position:0%
to because I I think it's more fair if
 
04:19:24.050 --> 04:19:24.060 align:start position:0%
we don't have the 700 000 and you
 
04:19:26.210 --> 04:19:26.220 align:start position:0%
distribute that
 
04:19:29.150 --> 04:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
um across the businesses that are
 
04:19:31.130 --> 04:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
actually making money because the
 
04:19:32.330 --> 04:19:32.340 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand is charged before
 
04:19:35.330 --> 04:19:35.340 align:start position:0%
they've made any money at all
 
04:19:36.830 --> 04:19:36.840 align:start position:0%
representative almond
 
04:19:38.870 --> 04:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
yes on
 
04:19:43.070 --> 04:19:43.080 align:start position:0%
the 500 000 that they get for the
 
04:19:43.080 --> 04:19:44.150 align:start position:0%
the 500 000 that they get for the
biennium

04:19:44.150 --> 04:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
04:19:47.630 --> 04:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
and they'll spend it bit by bit rather
 
04:19:49.849 --> 04:19:49.859 align:start position:0%
than having it all locked up I think at
 
04:19:56.510 --> 04:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
one time on is uh has to be paid back
 
04:20:01.269 --> 04:20:01.279 align:start position:0%
uh through what they get in later years
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:13.849 --> 04:20:13.859 align:start position:0%
and what they get back at a later time
 
04:20:16.550 --> 04:20:16.560 align:start position:0%
I guess at this point isn't going to be
 
04:20:19.729 --> 04:20:19.739 align:start position:0%
very much money
 
04:20:19.739 --> 04:20:24.050 align:start position:0%
very much money
since

04:20:24.050 --> 04:20:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:27.530 --> 04:20:27.540 align:start position:0%
on but they're they're two issues with
 
04:20:29.929 --> 04:20:29.939 align:start position:0%
that one that the other one is in the
 
04:20:33.349 --> 04:20:33.359 align:start position:0%
timing in this which
 
04:20:36.950 --> 04:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
I need to talk about also but
 
04:20:36.960 --> 04:20:38.689 align:start position:0%
I need to talk about also but
um

04:20:38.689 --> 04:20:38.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:20:38.699 --> 04:20:40.370 align:start position:0%
um
they're

04:20:40.370 --> 04:20:40.380 align:start position:0%
they're
 
04:20:42.830 --> 04:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be getting back
 
04:20:48.050 --> 04:20:48.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:51.650 --> 04:20:51.660 align:start position:0%
just I think someone else remind me if
 
04:20:55.010 --> 04:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong on that on all they get back
 
04:20:58.550 --> 04:20:58.560 align:start position:0%
is five percent of the profits
 
04:21:02.630 --> 04:21:02.640 align:start position:0%
that are left after whose they is it HHS
 
04:21:05.330 --> 04:21:05.340 align:start position:0%
yes HHS
 
04:21:08.750 --> 04:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh it which is controlling the fund that
 
04:21:11.689 --> 04:21:11.699 align:start position:0%
does the education
 
04:21:14.929 --> 04:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
my question was I guess about the this
 
04:21:18.950 --> 04:21:18.960 align:start position:0%
Revenue right if if the state is giving
 
04:21:22.309 --> 04:21:22.319 align:start position:0%
money to DHHS that money has to come
 
04:21:24.349 --> 04:21:24.359 align:start position:0%
from somewhere yes
 
04:21:26.570 --> 04:21:26.580 align:start position:0%
um and if we're not charging seven
 
04:21:28.189 --> 04:21:28.199 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars in licensing
 
04:21:30.229 --> 04:21:30.239 align:start position:0%
fees that's less Revenue that we're
 
04:21:32.090 --> 04:21:32.100 align:start position:0%
getting so I was just wondering if if we
 
04:21:33.830 --> 04:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
could think about the overall cost of
 
04:21:36.229 --> 04:21:36.239 align:start position:0%
the bill yeah well that
 
04:21:40.130 --> 04:21:40.140 align:start position:0%
that is at least theoretically if we've
 
04:21:42.950 --> 04:21:42.960 align:start position:0%
got a way of giving them
 
04:21:46.309 --> 04:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
money after the like the licensing and
 
04:21:49.849 --> 04:21:49.859 align:start position:0%
the purchases start on they are supposed
 
04:21:54.950 --> 04:21:54.960 align:start position:0%
to be paying that back it is carried uh
 
04:21:59.030 --> 04:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
the appropriation to a fund there are a
 
04:22:01.130 --> 04:22:01.140 align:start position:0%
lot a number of funds that go into the
 
04:22:02.750 --> 04:22:02.760 align:start position:0%
red at different times of the year
 
04:22:07.729 --> 04:22:07.739 align:start position:0%
dedicated funds and that money is
 
04:22:10.130 --> 04:22:10.140 align:start position:0%
carried as a negative number by the
 
04:22:13.189 --> 04:22:13.199 align:start position:0%
treasury for that fund and when the fund
 
04:22:15.490 --> 04:22:15.500 align:start position:0%
gets enough
 
04:22:19.309 --> 04:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
money above their operation costs that
 
04:22:23.510 --> 04:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
could pay back that money it's applied
 
04:22:25.670 --> 04:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
to the negative
 
04:22:28.070 --> 04:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
so that they eventually come back to a
 
04:22:30.110 --> 04:22:30.120 align:start position:0%
positive you hope right but shouldn't
 
04:22:32.689 --> 04:22:32.699 align:start position:0%
that money that's going out shouldn't
 
04:22:35.870 --> 04:22:35.880 align:start position:0%
that money be repaid by a tax on
 
04:22:39.469 --> 04:22:39.479 align:start position:0%
cannabis not from their General
 
04:22:39.479 --> 04:22:42.229 align:start position:0%
cannabis not from their General
appropriation

04:22:42.229 --> 04:22:42.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
04:22:44.389 --> 04:22:44.399 align:start position:0%
they don't have a general appropriation
 
04:22:46.070 --> 04:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
for this
 
04:22:48.790 --> 04:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
04:22:52.010 --> 04:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
we have a vote before us and but I will
 
04:22:54.650 --> 04:22:54.660 align:start position:0%
let's just remind the group that we did
 
04:22:57.650 --> 04:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
a straw vote on going from 12.5 percent
 
04:23:02.150 --> 04:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
to 13 and there was no appetite for that
 
04:23:04.490 --> 04:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
it did not pass so I don't I think that
 
04:23:06.050 --> 04:23:06.060 align:start position:0%
would be unrealistic
 
04:23:08.450 --> 04:23:08.460 align:start position:0%
and I hear you but I just I'm not sure
 
04:23:11.570 --> 04:23:11.580 align:start position:0%
we should go backwards I think it may be
 
04:23:13.490 --> 04:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
appropriate to do a straw vote on this
 
04:23:15.889 --> 04:23:15.899 align:start position:0%
amendment understanding that that
 
04:23:18.650 --> 04:23:18.660 align:start position:0%
doesn't seem to be a lot of bipartisan
 
04:23:23.210 --> 04:23:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:23.220 --> 04:23:24.170 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:23:24.170 --> 04:23:24.180 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:23:25.490 --> 04:23:25.500 align:start position:0%
so well
 
04:23:27.530 --> 04:23:27.540 align:start position:0%
well yes representative homie yes just
 
04:23:31.550 --> 04:23:31.560 align:start position:0%
just basically one thing on the this
 
04:23:34.429 --> 04:23:34.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't mean that they're not going to
 
04:23:37.849 --> 04:23:37.859 align:start position:0%
the the businesses that are in this are
 
04:23:39.590 --> 04:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
aren't going to pay anything
 
04:23:43.370 --> 04:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
what this means is that the Liquor
 
04:23:45.769 --> 04:23:45.779 align:start position:0%
Commission is going to establish a
 
04:23:45.779 --> 04:23:46.849 align:start position:0%
Commission is going to establish a
reasonable

04:23:46.849 --> 04:23:46.859 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
04:23:48.769 --> 04:23:48.779 align:start position:0%
license fee
 
04:23:52.010 --> 04:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
and we don't know what that is and the
 
04:23:53.389 --> 04:23:53.399 align:start position:0%
other point I would make is we're going
 
04:23:54.769 --> 04:23:54.779 align:start position:0%
to make more money out of this so we
 
04:23:56.269 --> 04:23:56.279 align:start position:0%
think I mean people have been very
 
04:23:57.889 --> 04:23:57.899 align:start position:0%
pessimistic I think there'll be enough
 
04:24:01.130 --> 04:24:01.140 align:start position:0%
revenues to cover all this
 
04:24:01.140 --> 04:24:02.990 align:start position:0%
revenues to cover all this
well

04:24:02.990 --> 04:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
04:24:06.469 --> 04:24:06.479 align:start position:0%
okay so let's do a straw vote there is
 
04:24:09.170 --> 04:24:09.180 align:start position:0%
one other thing that is brought into
 
04:24:12.769 --> 04:24:12.779 align:start position:0%
question by this the in in my second
 
04:24:14.750 --> 04:24:14.760 align:start position:0%
amendment that we haven't discussed yet
 
04:24:20.750 --> 04:24:20.760 align:start position:0%
on they changed the 18 months to a year
 
04:24:20.760 --> 04:24:22.670 align:start position:0%
on they changed the 18 months to a year
uh

04:24:22.670 --> 04:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:24:26.570 --> 04:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
at without this at 18 months after the
 
04:24:29.330 --> 04:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
effective date of this chapter
 
04:24:33.469 --> 04:24:33.479 align:start position:0%
The Liquor Commission is going to be
 
04:24:36.710 --> 04:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
wrapping up is going to oh it's just
 
04:24:38.929 --> 04:24:38.939 align:start position:0%
going to be starting doing rules we need
 
04:24:41.870 --> 04:24:41.880 align:start position:0%
them to be in sync that both the Dual
 
04:24:44.950 --> 04:24:44.960 align:start position:0%
use and the regular cannabis
 
04:24:48.170 --> 04:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
organizations are getting their rules at
 
04:24:49.969 --> 04:24:49.979 align:start position:0%
the same time and can get their licenses
 
04:24:53.929 --> 04:24:53.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:55.910 --> 04:24:55.920 align:start position:0%
because otherwise we're we're
 
04:24:59.210 --> 04:24:59.220 align:start position:0%
prejudicing against the Dual use groups
 
04:25:03.050 --> 04:25:03.060 align:start position:0%
that all want to also do adult cannabis
 
04:25:07.429 --> 04:25:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:11.389 --> 04:25:11.399 align:start position:0%
okay all right so we're looking at yes
 
04:25:16.250 --> 04:25:16.260 align:start position:0%
18 months is okay we'll do that next
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
um let's talk about 1217 that's the
 
04:25:21.590 --> 04:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
rochefort amendment
 
04:25:23.809 --> 04:25:23.819 align:start position:0%
let's understand what it is all those in
 
04:25:35.990 --> 04:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:36.000 --> 04:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
s

04:25:37.020 --> 04:25:37.030 align:start position:0%
s
 
04:25:37.030 --> 04:25:40.370 align:start position:0%
s
[Music]

04:25:40.370 --> 04:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:40.380 --> 04:25:41.710 align:start position:0%
 
ome

04:25:41.710 --> 04:25:41.720 align:start position:0%
ome
 
04:25:45.290 --> 04:25:45.300 align:start position:0%
I think it's 20. okay all right so this
 
04:25:47.030 --> 04:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
broad support for that thank the
 
04:25:49.910 --> 04:25:49.920 align:start position:0%
goodness okay all right so we have a
 
04:25:52.490 --> 04:25:52.500 align:start position:0%
couple things now let's go to
 
04:25:54.769 --> 04:25:54.779 align:start position:0%
representative almies in the Second
 
04:25:56.809 --> 04:25:56.819 align:start position:0%
Amendment and then we will then go back
 
04:25:59.269 --> 04:25:59.279 align:start position:0%
to the spillsbury amendment and then
 
04:26:01.670 --> 04:26:01.680 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can merge them all together
 
04:26:05.570 --> 04:26:05.580 align:start position:0%
okay again these are straw votes uh can
 
04:26:08.710 --> 04:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
you what oh
 
04:26:08.720 --> 04:26:10.630 align:start position:0%
you what oh
so

04:26:10.630 --> 04:26:10.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:17.330 --> 04:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
so this one
 
04:26:20.689 --> 04:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
this was the one that we've just
 
04:26:20.699 --> 04:26:24.050 align:start position:0%
this was the one that we've just
done

04:26:24.050 --> 04:26:24.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:27.290 --> 04:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
I think no it isn't
 
04:26:27.300 --> 04:26:29.570 align:start position:0%
I think no it isn't
right

04:26:29.570 --> 04:26:29.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:34.010 --> 04:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:38.590 --> 04:26:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:41.570 --> 04:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a copy yet I gave you
 
04:26:41.580 --> 04:26:49.269 align:start position:0%
and I don't have a copy yet I gave you
more

04:26:49.269 --> 04:26:49.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:52.910 --> 04:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
and the previous version of it
 
04:26:55.010 --> 04:26:55.020 align:start position:0%
you all should
 
04:26:57.170 --> 04:26:57.180 align:start position:0%
tear up or something so we don't get
 
04:27:03.110 --> 04:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
what no I'm asking 12 23.
 
04:27:09.849 --> 04:27:09.859 align:start position:0%
I think no wait a minute
 
04:27:12.969 --> 04:27:12.979 align:start position:0%
yeah okay
 
04:27:17.450 --> 04:27:17.460 align:start position:0%
we are doing 12 23.
 
04:27:17.460 --> 04:27:20.330 align:start position:0%
we are doing 12 23.
uh

04:27:20.330 --> 04:27:20.340 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:27:22.370 --> 04:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
there's not enough room in this place
 
04:27:26.210 --> 04:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:28.490 --> 04:27:28.500 align:start position:0%
no no 12
 
04:27:31.550 --> 04:27:31.560 align:start position:0%
no 12 23
 
04:27:36.110 --> 04:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
is the one that we're replacing
 
04:27:37.849 --> 04:27:37.859 align:start position:0%
we just voted 20
 
04:27:39.050 --> 04:27:39.060 align:start position:0%
20. yes
 
04:27:44.689 --> 04:27:44.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:48.290 --> 04:27:48.300 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah right now we're we're talking
 
04:27:52.010 --> 04:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
about 12 replacing 12 24.
 
04:27:55.550 --> 04:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
and the only thing that this does
 
04:27:55.560 --> 04:27:57.170 align:start position:0%
and the only thing that this does
different

04:27:57.170 --> 04:27:57.180 align:start position:0%
different
 
04:27:57.180 --> 04:28:01.189 align:start position:0%
different
from

04:28:01.189 --> 04:28:01.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:05.990 --> 04:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:11.630 --> 04:28:11.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:14.030 --> 04:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
oh I forgot to take out the Liquor
 
04:28:16.429 --> 04:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
Commission but anyway
 
04:28:16.439 --> 04:28:18.349 align:start position:0%
Commission but anyway
um

04:28:18.349 --> 04:28:18.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:18.359 --> 04:28:22.070 align:start position:0%
um
certificates

04:28:22.070 --> 04:28:22.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:31.790 --> 04:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:37.189 --> 04:28:37.199 align:start position:0%
oh yeah it's on page three line 34 we
 
04:28:39.649 --> 04:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
start the paragraph that they forgot to
 
04:28:41.269 --> 04:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
put in
 
04:28:43.610 --> 04:28:43.620 align:start position:0%
which is Substance Abuse Prevention and
 
04:28:46.670 --> 04:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
Recovery Fund established
 
04:28:48.769 --> 04:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
which it's
 
04:28:51.889 --> 04:28:51.899 align:start position:0%
we needed that one in there still
 
04:28:55.010 --> 04:28:55.020 align:start position:0%
and it also changed its name to what
 
04:28:56.689 --> 04:28:56.699 align:start position:0%
they're using
 
04:28:56.699 --> 04:28:59.090 align:start position:0%
they're using
um

04:28:59.090 --> 04:28:59.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:02.269 --> 04:29:02.279 align:start position:0%
but I have a couple of other things to
 
04:29:02.279 --> 04:29:03.229 align:start position:0%
but I have a couple of other things to
say

04:29:03.229 --> 04:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
say
 
04:29:07.070 --> 04:29:07.080 align:start position:0%
say about this I asked them to do two
 
04:29:07.080 --> 04:29:08.510 align:start position:0%
say about this I asked them to do two
things

04:29:08.510 --> 04:29:08.520 align:start position:0%
things
 
04:29:10.849 --> 04:29:10.859 align:start position:0%
um and if you look
 
04:29:10.859 --> 04:29:12.830 align:start position:0%
um and if you look
at

04:29:12.830 --> 04:29:12.840 align:start position:0%
at
 
04:29:16.429 --> 04:29:16.439 align:start position:0%
the yellow highlighted version
 
04:29:18.349 --> 04:29:18.359 align:start position:0%
of this
 
04:29:20.570 --> 04:29:20.580 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
04:29:20.580 --> 04:29:24.710 align:start position:0%
you can see
what

04:29:24.710 --> 04:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:28.910 --> 04:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:33.370 --> 04:29:33.380 align:start position:0%
a lot better than you can yeah
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:42.290 --> 04:29:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:45.710 --> 04:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
ah thank you sharp eyes
 
04:29:45.720 --> 04:29:52.910 align:start position:0%
ah thank you sharp eyes
um

04:29:52.910 --> 04:29:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:56.689 --> 04:29:56.699 align:start position:0%
I had separated these out
 
04:30:00.050 --> 04:30:00.060 align:start position:0%
by using a different type font Ariel 12
 
04:30:04.250 --> 04:30:04.260 align:start position:0%
for for what I was sticking in to what
 
04:30:04.260 --> 04:30:05.809 align:start position:0%
for for what I was sticking in to what
the

04:30:05.809 --> 04:30:05.819 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:30:10.370 --> 04:30:10.380 align:start position:0%
the HHS group wanted from this
 
04:30:14.149 --> 04:30:14.159 align:start position:0%
there are it most a lot of it is just
 
04:30:16.969 --> 04:30:16.979 align:start position:0%
they corrected the
 
04:30:16.979 --> 04:30:17.809 align:start position:0%
they corrected the
um

04:30:17.809 --> 04:30:17.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:23.090 --> 04:30:23.100 align:start position:0%
the number of the RSA that that relates
 
04:30:25.550 --> 04:30:25.560 align:start position:0%
to the Cannabis fund and to the
 
04:30:28.189 --> 04:30:28.199 align:start position:0%
substance use prevention and Recovery
 
04:30:30.530 --> 04:30:30.540 align:start position:0%
Fund uh because they had the numbers
 
04:30:33.950 --> 04:30:33.960 align:start position:0%
wrong because they kept the numbers from
 
04:30:37.969 --> 04:30:37.979 align:start position:0%
from the previous uh bill
 
04:30:40.250 --> 04:30:40.260 align:start position:0%
from the original bill that came to the
 
04:30:40.260 --> 04:30:43.309 align:start position:0%
from the original bill that came to the
house

04:30:43.309 --> 04:30:43.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:46.070 --> 04:30:46.080 align:start position:0%
they've changed all the Substance Abuse
 
04:30:48.229 --> 04:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
Prevention recovery funds to substance
 
04:30:48.239 --> 04:30:49.250 align:start position:0%
Prevention recovery funds to substance
use

04:30:49.250 --> 04:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
use
 
04:30:52.550 --> 04:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
which they prefer
 
04:30:55.729 --> 04:30:55.739 align:start position:0%
we're using
 
04:30:55.739 --> 04:30:56.689 align:start position:0%
we're using
um

04:30:56.689 --> 04:30:56.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:30:59.210 --> 04:30:59.220 align:start position:0%
and they've taken out the word trust
 
04:31:02.030 --> 04:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
from trust fund where it appears in two
 
04:31:07.370 --> 04:31:07.380 align:start position:0%
places uh in there because it the trust
 
04:31:09.290 --> 04:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
fund was in the first version of the
 
04:31:11.750 --> 04:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
bill and wasn't in the one that left
 
04:31:11.760 --> 04:31:15.649 align:start position:0%
bill and wasn't in the one that left
Commerce

04:31:15.649 --> 04:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:17.570 --> 04:31:17.580 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead I have a problem with the
 
04:31:20.450 --> 04:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
word use it isn't use it abuse
 
04:31:22.070 --> 04:31:22.080 align:start position:0%
is she named it
 
04:31:24.110 --> 04:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't care what they named it we
 
04:31:30.110 --> 04:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:32.570 --> 04:31:32.580 align:start position:0%
all right we have a bunch of wait hands
 
04:31:35.030 --> 04:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
waving over in this direction can we yes
 
04:31:37.250 --> 04:31:37.260 align:start position:0%
go ahead please representative
 
04:31:39.469 --> 04:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm wanting to make the same
 
04:31:42.110 --> 04:31:42.120 align:start position:0%
point from a different angle
 
04:31:44.210 --> 04:31:44.220 align:start position:0%
um if that's true maybe we should go
 
04:31:46.429 --> 04:31:46.439 align:start position:0%
throughout the statutes and change
 
04:31:49.370 --> 04:31:49.380 align:start position:0%
from use to abuse because we're taking
 
04:31:51.290 --> 04:31:51.300 align:start position:0%
something which has been an illegal
 
04:31:53.330 --> 04:31:53.340 align:start position:0%
activity and we're making it legal we're
 
04:31:55.070 --> 04:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
not setting up the programs to treat
 
04:31:58.189 --> 04:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
what we are legalizing we're we're
 
04:32:00.050 --> 04:32:00.060 align:start position:0%
setting up the programs or funding the
 
04:32:01.990 --> 04:32:02.000 align:start position:0%
programs to treat
 
04:32:02.000 --> 04:32:03.649 align:start position:0%
programs to treat
excessive

04:32:03.649 --> 04:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
excessive
 
04:32:06.530 --> 04:32:06.540 align:start position:0%
which is to say abuse I think this only
 
04:32:08.870 --> 04:32:08.880 align:start position:0%
confuses things and
 
04:32:11.570 --> 04:32:11.580 align:start position:0%
should be declined
 
04:32:15.649 --> 04:32:15.659 align:start position:0%
okay but I think that they already have
 
04:32:17.030 --> 04:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
that program
 
04:32:20.149 --> 04:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
and I have no idea what it's called
 
04:32:22.250 --> 04:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
oops representative you said and and
 
04:32:24.590 --> 04:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
most specifically this is policy this is
 
04:32:26.330 --> 04:32:26.340 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do in our purview
 
04:32:26.340 --> 04:32:28.429 align:start position:0%
this has nothing to do in our purview
period

04:32:28.429 --> 04:32:28.439 align:start position:0%
period
 
04:32:31.790 --> 04:32:31.800 align:start position:0%
but it it does if we
 
04:32:34.010 --> 04:32:34.020 align:start position:0%
we're not using the name that they've
 
04:32:35.809 --> 04:32:35.819 align:start position:0%
already got that's not what we have for
 
04:32:38.030 --> 04:32:38.040 align:start position:0%
though representative we're here for tax
 
04:32:40.429 --> 04:32:40.439 align:start position:0%
policy Revenue we're not here for word
 
04:32:43.550 --> 04:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
smithing policy issues no no but that
 
04:32:46.189 --> 04:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I I agree with you on one level but
 
04:32:53.750 --> 04:32:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:55.149 --> 04:32:55.159 align:start position:0%
okay okay
 
04:32:59.990 --> 04:33:00.000 align:start position:0%
but we do need to change the reference
 
04:33:02.290 --> 04:33:02.300 align:start position:0%
the reference 24
 
04:33:09.949 --> 04:33:09.959 align:start position:0%
uh 318 f 24 to 21. uh Madam chairman yes
 
04:33:14.209 --> 04:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
um those uh changes which were provided
 
04:33:16.670 --> 04:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
by representative Ames have been
 
04:33:19.609 --> 04:33:19.619 align:start position:0%
Incorporated so oh in yours okay so
 
04:33:21.590 --> 04:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see that part of it doesn't
 
04:33:27.289 --> 04:33:27.299 align:start position:0%
happen okay great yes I did not want I
 
04:33:29.510 --> 04:33:29.520 align:start position:0%
did not have the ability to talk with
 
04:33:31.369 --> 04:33:31.379 align:start position:0%
them to figure out what was going on
 
04:33:32.929 --> 04:33:32.939 align:start position:0%
because they always disappeared before
 
04:33:35.570 --> 04:33:35.580 align:start position:0%
we got halfway through the day
 
04:33:35.580 --> 04:33:37.789 align:start position:0%
we got halfway through the day
um

04:33:37.789 --> 04:33:37.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:43.310 --> 04:33:43.320 align:start position:0%
and but trust fund trust fund was in the
 
04:33:45.890 --> 04:33:45.900 align:start position:0%
original language
 
04:33:50.029 --> 04:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
it was a trust fund it is no longer a
 
04:33:53.570 --> 04:33:53.580 align:start position:0%
trust fund they just took out trust
 
04:33:59.390 --> 04:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:00.769 --> 04:34:00.779 align:start position:0%
all right where are you in your
 
04:34:02.390 --> 04:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
amendment I am lost
 
04:34:09.769 --> 04:34:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:14.529 --> 04:34:14.539 align:start position:0%
on you can't see trust in there in the
 
04:34:19.310 --> 04:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
amendment that belongs to to uh
 
04:34:19.320 --> 04:34:20.051 align:start position:0%
amendment that belongs to to uh
on

04:34:20.051 --> 04:34:20.061 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:34:23.810 --> 04:34:23.820 align:start position:0%
legislative Services because they
 
04:34:26.929 --> 04:34:26.939 align:start position:0%
repealed and reenacted the whole thing
 
04:34:29.510 --> 04:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
okay I hate it when they do that I know
 
04:34:31.609 --> 04:34:31.619 align:start position:0%
well but
 
04:34:38.150 --> 04:34:38.160 align:start position:0%
what it said before on line 20 uh three
 
04:34:39.830 --> 04:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
was she'll continue to make
 
04:34:43.970 --> 04:34:43.980 align:start position:0%
distributions from the trust fund
 
04:34:46.789 --> 04:34:46.799 align:start position:0%
but there they took out the trust fund
 
04:34:49.970 --> 04:34:49.980 align:start position:0%
concept somewhere else when they when
 
04:34:52.970 --> 04:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
hunt redid it
 
04:34:54.529 --> 04:34:54.539 align:start position:0%
okay well it's
 
04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
is 12 28 okay as it stands
 
04:35:01.789 --> 04:35:01.799 align:start position:0%
is 12 20 Amendment 12 28 okay as it
 
04:35:01.799 --> 04:35:03.170 align:start position:0%
is 12 20 Amendment 12 28 okay as it
stands

04:35:03.170 --> 04:35:03.180 align:start position:0%
stands
 
04:35:03.180 --> 04:35:04.789 align:start position:0%
stands
no

04:35:04.789 --> 04:35:04.799 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:35:07.070 --> 04:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to I mean for one
 
04:35:08.929 --> 04:35:08.939 align:start position:0%
thing you're going to make me go back
 
04:35:11.990 --> 04:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
and get them to put abuse into instead
 
04:35:15.051 --> 04:35:15.061 align:start position:0%
of use which doesn't take very long
 
04:35:18.789 --> 04:35:18.799 align:start position:0%
it's just a search and replace
 
04:35:21.289 --> 04:35:21.299 align:start position:0%
okay well I guess
 
04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
let's take a straw vote on do we
 
04:35:29.510 --> 04:35:29.520 align:start position:0%
think that we should adopt 12 28. I
 
04:35:29.520 --> 04:35:31.490 align:start position:0%
think that we should adopt 12 28. I
haven't

04:35:31.490 --> 04:35:31.500 align:start position:0%
haven't
 
04:35:34.551 --> 04:35:34.561 align:start position:0%
there's some other wordsmithing stuff in
 
04:35:38.689 --> 04:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
here that I will Madam chair void and
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
then then there's the timing issue which
 
04:35:45.650 --> 04:35:45.660 align:start position:0%
starts in under dual youth certificates
 
04:35:51.789 --> 04:35:51.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:55.189 --> 04:35:55.199 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to change the 18 months
 
04:35:57.590 --> 04:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
to one year as I said I didn't have a
 
04:36:00.051 --> 04:36:00.061 align:start position:0%
chance to discuss this stuff with them
 
04:36:03.170 --> 04:36:03.180 align:start position:0%
and he's not here this afternoon
 
04:36:03.180 --> 04:36:04.429 align:start position:0%
and he's not here this afternoon
so

04:36:04.429 --> 04:36:04.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:36:08.869 --> 04:36:08.879 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me what we've got for
 
04:36:10.789 --> 04:36:10.799 align:start position:0%
others who think they understand the
 
04:36:15.109 --> 04:36:15.119 align:start position:0%
timing of this process on we've got the
 
04:36:19.730 --> 04:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
regular cannabis places getting their
 
04:36:23.029 --> 04:36:23.039 align:start position:0%
rules finished that rules started
 
04:36:26.109 --> 04:36:26.119 align:start position:0%
a year within a year and a half after
 
04:36:30.529 --> 04:36:30.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:38.029 --> 04:36:38.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:40.429 --> 04:36:40.439 align:start position:0%
I did it I'm sorry I'm not sure about
 
04:36:51.170 --> 04:36:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:54.670 --> 04:36:54.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:56.929 --> 04:36:56.939 align:start position:0%
that's the new handout though is
 
04:36:58.789 --> 04:36:58.799 align:start position:0%
actually a different topic so we need to
 
04:37:00.529 --> 04:37:00.539 align:start position:0%
continue and finish the Omni
 
04:37:02.869 --> 04:37:02.879 align:start position:0%
representative Army discussion first
 
04:37:06.529 --> 04:37:06.539 align:start position:0%
before we go to this if we if if that's
 
04:37:08.869 --> 04:37:08.879 align:start position:0%
true and I think that's true that's that
 
04:37:13.631 --> 04:37:13.641 align:start position:0%
the regular cannabis places license on
 
04:37:16.970 --> 04:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
rules are going to be written starting a
 
04:37:18.830 --> 04:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
year and a half after
 
04:37:18.840 --> 04:37:20.390 align:start position:0%
year and a half after
we

04:37:20.390 --> 04:37:20.400 align:start position:0%
we
 
04:37:23.929 --> 04:37:23.939 align:start position:0%
after we approve this
 
04:37:26.570 --> 04:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
going through jail car
 
04:37:28.970 --> 04:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
I think that means
 
04:37:31.910 --> 04:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so then we shouldn't give them a half
 
04:37:31.920 --> 04:37:33.051 align:start position:0%
um so then we shouldn't give them a half
year

04:37:33.051 --> 04:37:33.061 align:start position:0%
year
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
extra time
 
04:37:37.490 --> 04:37:37.500 align:start position:0%
and this this one they're saying no
 
04:37:39.051 --> 04:37:39.061 align:start position:0%
later than
 
04:37:43.429 --> 04:37:43.439 align:start position:0%
one year instead of 18 months
 
04:37:46.310 --> 04:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
but if anybody else remembers I remember
 
04:37:48.349 --> 04:37:48.359 align:start position:0%
something about three they wanted three
 
04:37:50.209 --> 04:37:50.219 align:start position:0%
years or something though am I the only
 
04:37:53.090 --> 04:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
one the the agency wants three years
 
04:37:57.051 --> 04:37:57.061 align:start position:0%
until a time that they are
 
04:38:04.730 --> 04:38:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:07.250 --> 04:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
on and
 
04:38:10.131 --> 04:38:10.141 align:start position:0%
the agency wants I think it's a year I
 
04:38:12.769 --> 04:38:12.779 align:start position:0%
wish some of them were here but on a
 
04:38:15.590 --> 04:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:19.789 --> 04:38:19.799 align:start position:0%
um before they they put the rules into
 
04:38:22.310 --> 04:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
form to hand to jail car and start
 
04:38:25.131 --> 04:38:25.141 align:start position:0%
fighting that battle
 
04:38:25.141 --> 04:38:26.449 align:start position:0%
fighting that battle
on

04:38:26.449 --> 04:38:26.459 align:start position:0%
on
 
04:38:29.150 --> 04:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
if that's true for all the other
 
04:38:34.010 --> 04:38:34.020 align:start position:0%
marijuana growers and manufacturers it
 
04:38:35.631 --> 04:38:35.641 align:start position:0%
ought to be true for these guys too
 
04:38:38.689 --> 04:38:38.699 align:start position:0%
rather than getting a head start of six
 
04:38:38.699 --> 04:38:42.529 align:start position:0%
rather than getting a head start of six
months

04:38:42.529 --> 04:38:42.539 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:42.539 --> 04:38:48.949 align:start position:0%
 
if

04:38:48.949 --> 04:38:48.959 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:55.310 --> 04:38:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:38:59.269 --> 04:38:59.279 align:start position:0%
no that's until they start licensing and
 
04:39:01.551 --> 04:39:01.561 align:start position:0%
starting to operate we're not getting
 
04:39:04.789 --> 04:39:04.799 align:start position:0%
anywhere so I I wonder if we could talk
 
04:39:07.609 --> 04:39:07.619 align:start position:0%
about 1228 represent almie's bill with
 
04:39:09.051 --> 04:39:09.061 align:start position:0%
the understanding use is going to go
 
04:39:11.750 --> 04:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
back to abuse
 
04:39:14.689 --> 04:39:14.699 align:start position:0%
well there's that excuse and I was
 
04:39:16.429 --> 04:39:16.439 align:start position:0%
trying to bring up the other issues in
 
04:39:19.730 --> 04:39:19.740 align:start position:0%
here uh Roman numeral three in Roman
 
04:39:23.289 --> 04:39:23.299 align:start position:0%
numeral four will come out
 
04:39:31.429 --> 04:39:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:31.439 --> 04:39:35.090 align:start position:0%
 
on

04:39:35.090 --> 04:39:35.100 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:39.410 --> 04:39:39.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:43.490 --> 04:39:43.500 align:start position:0%
uh that comes out if it passes what's
 
04:39:46.550 --> 04:39:46.560 align:start position:0%
still valid in here is going to be all
 
04:39:50.270 --> 04:39:50.280 align:start position:0%
of my errata that separate The Liquor
 
04:39:56.530 --> 04:39:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:01.310 --> 04:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
now Madam chair is use goes to abuse
 
04:40:04.190 --> 04:40:04.200 align:start position:0%
sections three and four are out
 
04:40:08.868 --> 04:40:08.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:12.890 --> 04:40:12.900 align:start position:0%
section on section 2 is out because it's
 
04:40:17.030 --> 04:40:17.040 align:start position:0%
in the spilsbury now section three is
 
04:40:21.830 --> 04:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
out because it's as you call it word
 
04:40:23.868 --> 04:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
processing except for the part I was
 
04:40:25.730 --> 04:40:25.740 align:start position:0%
just trying to talk about which is do
 
04:40:27.410 --> 04:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
they get a heads
 
04:40:30.410 --> 04:40:30.420 align:start position:0%
the earlier's time
 
04:40:33.410 --> 04:40:33.420 align:start position:0%
than uh
 
04:40:36.368 --> 04:40:36.378 align:start position:0%
then the the rest in
 
04:40:39.830 --> 04:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
developing the rule making process
 
04:40:39.840 --> 04:40:41.448 align:start position:0%
developing the rule making process
um

04:40:41.448 --> 04:40:41.458 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:40:44.030 --> 04:40:44.040 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember the timing now I'm
 
04:40:47.630 --> 04:40:47.640 align:start position:0%
sorry uh section
 
04:40:50.390 --> 04:40:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh you know I can't bring that paper
 
04:40:52.550 --> 04:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
towards the next section
 
04:40:55.990 --> 04:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
on Madam chair yes
 
04:40:58.630 --> 04:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
whoever's talking to the Madam chair
 
04:41:01.430 --> 04:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
for the sake of expediency I've read
 
04:41:02.930 --> 04:41:02.940 align:start position:0%
through this my colleague has read
 
04:41:04.850 --> 04:41:04.860 align:start position:0%
through this there's no nothing in here
 
04:41:07.850 --> 04:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
but policy changes why yes there's
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
nothing in here but policy changes we're
 
04:41:12.770 --> 04:41:12.780 align:start position:0%
renaming the liquor and can cannabis
 
04:41:14.690 --> 04:41:14.700 align:start position:0%
commission to the Cannabis commission
 
04:41:16.550 --> 04:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
that's not how this is written and it's
 
04:41:19.788 --> 04:41:19.798 align:start position:0%
not how it was sent over to us to look
 
04:41:22.970 --> 04:41:22.980 align:start position:0%
at the Tax and Revenue issues and we
 
04:41:25.850 --> 04:41:25.860 align:start position:0%
could go on for the next eight hours or
 
04:41:28.190 --> 04:41:28.200 align:start position:0%
we could press forward with this my
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
suggestion is we take straw poll on this
 
04:41:32.030 --> 04:41:32.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and go on to the next straw
 
04:41:34.368 --> 04:41:34.378 align:start position:0%
poll after we discuss the next amendment
 
04:41:37.310 --> 04:41:37.320 align:start position:0%
I would like to accomplish this really
 
04:41:39.230 --> 04:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
is an appropriate tone I've never been
 
04:41:40.670 --> 04:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
at Ways and Means where someone has
 
04:41:42.530 --> 04:41:42.540 align:start position:0%
talked to us like that I'm not talking
 
04:41:44.330 --> 04:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
to anyone like that I'm addressing the
 
04:41:44.340 --> 04:41:45.470 align:start position:0%
to anyone like that I'm addressing the
chair

04:41:45.470 --> 04:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:41:47.030 --> 04:41:47.040 align:start position:0%
all right guys
 
04:41:49.850 --> 04:41:49.860 align:start position:0%
um I I hear all sides here and I
 
04:41:51.770 --> 04:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
understand we're all tired it's been a
 
04:41:53.448 --> 04:41:53.458 align:start position:0%
long day
 
04:41:55.730 --> 04:41:55.740 align:start position:0%
um tone is noted we let's keep this
 
04:41:58.430 --> 04:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
professional and respectful we do have
 
04:42:00.170 --> 04:42:00.180 align:start position:0%
enough information I think in front of
 
04:42:03.230 --> 04:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
us on the uh representative almi's
 
04:42:05.690 --> 04:42:05.700 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1228 so I think it's in order
 
04:42:08.090 --> 04:42:08.100 align:start position:0%
to just get a feel for where we are with
 
04:42:09.948 --> 04:42:09.958 align:start position:0%
a straw vote
 
04:42:11.750 --> 04:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
um so let me just do that and then if we
 
04:42:14.030 --> 04:42:14.040 align:start position:0%
need further excuse me I want to reply
 
04:42:17.990 --> 04:42:18.000 align:start position:0%
to that here the issue of whether the
 
04:42:20.690 --> 04:42:20.700 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission is called liquor and
 
04:42:27.410 --> 04:42:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:30.470 --> 04:42:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay and if we send it over the Senate
 
04:42:33.410 --> 04:42:33.420 align:start position:0%
like that and the Senate passed it there
 
04:42:37.610 --> 04:42:37.620 align:start position:0%
is is a major difficulty if we get a
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
president who doesn't like cannabis
 
04:42:42.770 --> 04:42:42.780 align:start position:0%
for our entire Liquor Commission and if
 
04:42:45.830 --> 04:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
I can respond to that no no I'm sorry
 
04:42:47.990 --> 04:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
let's let's stop we're not going back
 
04:42:50.810 --> 04:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
and forth on this okay we will now do a
 
04:42:54.610 --> 04:42:54.620 align:start position:0%
straw vote on whether we should pass
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
1228 as part of our committee Amendment
 
04:43:01.850 --> 04:43:01.860 align:start position:0%
all those in favor of the items in 1228
 
04:43:03.110 --> 04:43:03.120 align:start position:0%
raise your hand
 
04:43:05.510 --> 04:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
don't understand the amendment so I
 
04:43:06.948 --> 04:43:06.958 align:start position:0%
can't vote
 
04:43:08.690 --> 04:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
hey yes
 
04:43:10.550 --> 04:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
okay okay so raise your hand if you
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
support still the vote okay anyone okay
 
04:43:15.770 --> 04:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
all those opposed I'm not voting I'm not
 
04:43:17.270 --> 04:43:17.280 align:start position:0%
voting either okay
 
04:43:21.650 --> 04:43:21.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:29.810 --> 04:43:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:29.820 --> 04:43:31.010 align:start position:0%
 
huh

04:43:31.010 --> 04:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
huh
 
04:43:33.550 --> 04:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
04:43:35.690 --> 04:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
 
04:43:35.700 --> 04:43:36.770 align:start position:0%
representative fellows
so

04:43:36.770 --> 04:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:39.650 --> 04:43:39.660 align:start position:0%
on this amendment 1228 we're going to
 
04:43:42.890 --> 04:43:42.900 align:start position:0%
cross out we're not we want to not
 
04:43:45.230 --> 04:43:45.240 align:start position:0%
include the first section
 
04:43:47.750 --> 04:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
section it says section two on line
 
04:43:51.170 --> 04:43:51.180 align:start position:0%
three and we're going to we don't need
 
04:43:54.890 --> 04:43:54.900 align:start position:0%
on page two we want to delete
 
04:43:57.948 --> 04:43:57.958 align:start position:0%
the Dual use certificate part that's in
 
04:44:00.770 --> 04:44:00.780 align:start position:0%
here because we just we already approved
 
04:44:03.490 --> 04:44:03.500 align:start position:0%
um representative roquefort's
 
04:44:07.730 --> 04:44:07.740 align:start position:0%
change to that and just on the issue of
 
04:44:11.330 --> 04:44:11.340 align:start position:0%
abuse and use my recollection is that
 
04:44:14.270 --> 04:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
the terminology people like using now is
 
04:44:16.788 --> 04:44:16.798 align:start position:0%
misuse they don't like the word abuse
 
04:44:19.550 --> 04:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
and they want misuse
 
04:44:22.990 --> 04:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
so that this would be substance misuse
 
04:44:26.448 --> 04:44:26.458 align:start position:0%
prevention but maybe someone can check
 
04:44:28.670 --> 04:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
on that we went over this we've been
 
04:44:30.650 --> 04:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
going over this for a solid 30 minutes
 
04:44:34.128 --> 04:44:34.138 align:start position:0%
it did not have strong support
 
04:44:36.288 --> 04:44:36.298 align:start position:0%
um if half of you didn't even vote so I
 
04:44:37.670 --> 04:44:37.680 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:44:39.530 --> 04:44:39.540 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure this is something we can
 
04:44:41.330 --> 04:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
cooperate into our committee Amendment
 
04:44:44.030 --> 04:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
yes represented all me yes I believe
 
04:44:47.090 --> 04:44:47.100 align:start position:0%
that the issue of liquor and cannabis
 
04:44:48.708 --> 04:44:48.718 align:start position:0%
fund is
 
04:44:51.770 --> 04:44:51.780 align:start position:0%
really important and I'll bring in a
 
04:44:56.690 --> 04:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
floor Amendment if I have to on that I I
 
04:45:00.050 --> 04:45:00.060 align:start position:0%
can understand the position of not using
 
04:45:00.060 --> 04:45:01.368 align:start position:0%
can understand the position of not using
their

04:45:01.368 --> 04:45:01.378 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:45:03.170 --> 04:45:03.180 align:start position:0%
um their language they're going to have
 
04:45:04.430 --> 04:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
to go
 
04:45:08.208 --> 04:45:08.218 align:start position:0%
to the Senate and try to get that in
 
04:45:12.110 --> 04:45:12.120 align:start position:0%
but on there is another timing issue in
 
04:45:15.050 --> 04:45:15.060 align:start position:0%
there which I've admitted I don't fully
 
04:45:17.270 --> 04:45:17.280 align:start position:0%
understand but I don't agree with what
 
04:45:19.310 --> 04:45:19.320 align:start position:0%
they did if it gives them an advantage
 
04:45:22.910 --> 04:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
over the other marijuana places
 
04:45:24.830 --> 04:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and you know and that is always an
 
04:45:27.110 --> 04:45:27.120 align:start position:0%
option too is once we get this committee
 
04:45:28.970 --> 04:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
Amendment done today if there's some
 
04:45:31.250 --> 04:45:31.260 align:start position:0%
remaining things you know certainly all
 
04:45:32.930 --> 04:45:32.940 align:start position:0%
welcome to do your own floor Amendment
 
04:45:34.970 --> 04:45:34.980 align:start position:0%
or maybe we can even come together and
 
04:45:38.090 --> 04:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
do that so okay okay so we'll move along
 
04:45:42.530 --> 04:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
from that piece and now we will go to
 
04:45:47.570 --> 04:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
the spillsbury and do set Amendment 1227
 
04:45:49.788 --> 04:45:49.798 align:start position:0%
should we skip over the abuse question
 
04:45:51.830 --> 04:45:51.840 align:start position:0%
or that's not enough it's not an
 
04:45:52.910 --> 04:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
amendment because we didn't seem to have
 
04:45:54.288 --> 04:45:54.298 align:start position:0%
enough support
 
04:45:54.298 --> 04:45:59.510 align:start position:0%
enough support
um

04:45:59.510 --> 04:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:01.788 --> 04:46:01.798 align:start position:0%
oh good question because that's what it
 
04:46:04.490 --> 04:46:04.500 align:start position:0%
should be well apparently apparently the
 
04:46:06.708 --> 04:46:06.718 align:start position:0%
original Bill well unless it's unchanged
 
04:46:08.390 --> 04:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
what we've got right here it says
 
04:46:10.430 --> 04:46:10.440 align:start position:0%
Substance Abuse Prevention Recovery Fund
 
04:46:12.890 --> 04:46:12.900 align:start position:0%
established so when you establish it
 
04:46:16.010 --> 04:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
that's when it gets its title yeah and
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have really good
 
04:46:20.448 --> 04:46:20.458 align:start position:0%
discussion amongst the committee on that
 
04:46:20.458 --> 04:46:21.890 align:start position:0%
discussion amongst the committee on that
nomenclature

04:46:21.890 --> 04:46:21.900 align:start position:0%
nomenclature
 
04:46:23.330 --> 04:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and again that's going back to the
 
04:46:24.948 --> 04:46:24.958 align:start position:0%
policy stuff so now we're starting to
 
04:46:26.690 --> 04:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
get murky there
 
04:46:26.700 --> 04:46:29.530 align:start position:0%
get murky there
um

04:46:29.530 --> 04:46:29.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:31.610 --> 04:46:31.620 align:start position:0%
I don't think they should have changed
 
04:46:33.770 --> 04:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
it on her Amendment
 
04:46:36.650 --> 04:46:36.660 align:start position:0%
because this right here says it's
 
04:46:39.890 --> 04:46:39.900 align:start position:0%
established and says its title gotcha
 
04:46:41.510 --> 04:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay well it's in there we know it's
 
04:46:44.750 --> 04:46:44.760 align:start position:0%
there and over time we certainly can
 
04:46:46.610 --> 04:46:46.620 align:start position:0%
tweak things you know as you know this
 
04:46:48.650 --> 04:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
we're just we're creating a construct
 
04:46:51.230 --> 04:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
right now a whole new construct and
 
04:46:53.330 --> 04:46:53.340 align:start position:0%
what's not going to be perfect but we're
 
04:46:54.590 --> 04:46:54.600 align:start position:0%
going to get it off the ground and then
 
04:46:57.050 --> 04:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to tweak it often along
 
04:46:59.628 --> 04:46:59.638 align:start position:0%
the way okay representative spilsberry
 
04:47:02.330 --> 04:47:02.340 align:start position:0%
would you be open to discussing or
 
04:47:04.490 --> 04:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
walking us through this amendment please
 
04:47:05.930 --> 04:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:47:08.750 --> 04:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
04:47:08.760 --> 04:47:11.208 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
um

04:47:11.208 --> 04:47:11.218 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:15.288 --> 04:47:15.298 align:start position:0%
so what OLS has done here
 
04:47:19.850 --> 04:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
is you can see this is now quite bulky
 
04:47:19.860 --> 04:47:20.930 align:start position:0%
is you can see this is now quite bulky
um

04:47:20.930 --> 04:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:23.830 --> 04:47:23.840 align:start position:0%
what do we have 21 Pages that's because
 
04:47:26.448 --> 04:47:26.458 align:start position:0%
we had made amendments to enough
 
04:47:30.110 --> 04:47:30.120 align:start position:0%
different places in section seven of the
 
04:47:34.190 --> 04:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
underlying Bill section 7 of HB 639 is
 
04:47:36.890 --> 04:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
the one that sets up the whole construct
 
04:47:39.948 --> 04:47:39.958 align:start position:0%
of cannabis regulation and it carries
 
04:47:43.610 --> 04:47:43.620 align:start position:0%
from page 3 to page 22 of the main bill
 
04:47:46.550 --> 04:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
so that's essentially what you have here
 
04:47:49.490 --> 04:47:49.500 align:start position:0%
before they get to that
 
04:47:52.850 --> 04:47:52.860 align:start position:0%
you'll see on page one
 
04:47:52.860 --> 04:47:54.310 align:start position:0%
you'll see on page one
in

04:47:54.310 --> 04:47:54.320 align:start position:0%
in
 
04:47:58.368 --> 04:47:58.378 align:start position:0%
lines one through seven
 
04:48:02.330 --> 04:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
this amendment makes the corrections to
 
04:48:04.430 --> 04:48:04.440 align:start position:0%
the citations that representative Ames
 
04:48:07.070 --> 04:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
had found so
 
04:48:13.190 --> 04:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
online 5 f24 has become F21 and online 7
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
f25 has become F22
 
04:48:19.250 --> 04:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
this is on the first page of this new
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:27.670 --> 04:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
purely a citation cleanup
 
04:48:31.730 --> 04:48:31.740 align:start position:0%
the next Amendment which covers lines 9
 
04:48:35.090 --> 04:48:35.100 align:start position:0%
through 13th is the same
 
04:48:38.750 --> 04:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
this one on line 13 changes the citation
 
04:48:41.708 --> 04:48:41.718 align:start position:0%
from 318 F20
 
04:48:45.288 --> 04:48:45.298 align:start position:0%
5 to f 22.
 
04:48:45.298 --> 04:48:47.570 align:start position:0%
5 to f 22.
okay

04:48:47.570 --> 04:48:47.580 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:48:51.650 --> 04:48:51.660 align:start position:0%
so the guts of this is then starting on
 
04:48:53.930 --> 04:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
line 17.
 
04:48:59.330 --> 04:48:59.340 align:start position:0%
all of chapter 318 f is restated
 
04:49:01.610 --> 04:49:01.620 align:start position:0%
and that continues
 
04:49:05.868 --> 04:49:05.878 align:start position:0%
all the way to page 21.
 
04:49:08.330 --> 04:49:08.340 align:start position:0%
now I'm I'm just going to jump past that
 
04:49:11.390 --> 04:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
and then come back to it on page 21 you
 
04:49:14.628 --> 04:49:14.638 align:start position:0%
see the another separate Amendment
 
04:49:17.810 --> 04:49:17.820 align:start position:0%
and that's the one that made the change
 
04:49:20.810 --> 04:49:20.820 align:start position:0%
of the term fiscal year to biennium
 
04:49:24.708 --> 04:49:24.718 align:start position:0%
but if we've had a straw poll
 
04:49:26.270 --> 04:49:26.280 align:start position:0%
that we're going to incorporate
 
04:49:29.208 --> 04:49:29.218 align:start position:0%
representative almi's Appropriations
 
04:49:29.218 --> 04:49:31.010 align:start position:0%
representative almi's Appropriations
language

04:49:31.010 --> 04:49:31.020 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:49:34.910 --> 04:49:34.920 align:start position:0%
this amendment on page 21 will be struck
 
04:49:37.010 --> 04:49:37.020 align:start position:0%
it's superseded
 
04:49:38.690 --> 04:49:38.700 align:start position:0%
okay so that's that's part of what
 
04:49:40.368 --> 04:49:40.378 align:start position:0%
representative almi and I will work at
 
04:49:41.930 --> 04:49:41.940 align:start position:0%
with OLX could you just give us the line
 
04:49:45.610 --> 04:49:45.620 align:start position:0%
you're saying page 21 line page 21.
 
04:49:49.550 --> 04:49:49.560 align:start position:0%
lines 5 through 15. yep
 
04:49:51.708 --> 04:49:51.718 align:start position:0%
the language in
 
04:49:51.718 --> 04:49:52.610 align:start position:0%
the language in
um

04:49:52.610 --> 04:49:52.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:49:56.930 --> 04:49:56.940 align:start position:0%
12 23 in 12 20
 
04:49:56.940 --> 04:49:59.570 align:start position:0%
12 23 in 12 20
24.

04:49:59.570 --> 04:49:59.580 align:start position:0%
24.
 
04:50:05.868 --> 04:50:05.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:08.990 --> 04:50:09.000 align:start position:0%
so house Amendment 1224 h
 
04:50:10.788 --> 04:50:10.798 align:start position:0%
will give us the language that
 
04:50:12.770 --> 04:50:12.780 align:start position:0%
supersedes this
 
04:50:15.770 --> 04:50:15.780 align:start position:0%
and they'll be Blended together into
 
04:50:15.780 --> 04:50:19.628 align:start position:0%
and they'll be Blended together into
men

04:50:19.628 --> 04:50:19.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:33.590 --> 04:50:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:33.600 --> 04:50:35.090 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

04:50:35.090 --> 04:50:35.100 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:50:37.368 --> 04:50:37.378 align:start position:0%
it is yes you're absolutely correct
 
04:50:39.910 --> 04:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:44.690 --> 04:50:44.700 align:start position:0%
1223 which relates to the Appropriations
 
04:50:44.700 --> 04:50:46.670 align:start position:0%
1223 which relates to the Appropriations
yeah

04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:50:52.670 --> 04:50:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:54.948 --> 04:50:54.958 align:start position:0%
he's going through it line by line right
 
04:50:57.230 --> 04:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
now and hopefully he'll show us that
 
04:51:00.590 --> 04:51:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:03.650 --> 04:51:03.660 align:start position:0%
so okay so the guts of what we have done
 
04:51:09.050 --> 04:51:09.060 align:start position:0%
now lies in this uh long amendment that
 
04:51:11.628 --> 04:51:11.638 align:start position:0%
begins on page one
 
04:51:13.910 --> 04:51:13.920 align:start position:0%
line 15.
 
04:51:16.190 --> 04:51:16.200 align:start position:0%
and it's simply been
 
04:51:16.200 --> 04:51:17.708 align:start position:0%
and it's simply been
um

04:51:17.708 --> 04:51:17.718 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:51:21.948 --> 04:51:21.958 align:start position:0%
incorporated into a restated
 
04:51:21.958 --> 04:51:25.550 align:start position:0%
incorporated into a restated
318f

04:51:25.550 --> 04:51:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:25.560 --> 04:51:27.948 align:start position:0%
 
so

04:51:27.948 --> 04:51:27.958 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:51:30.110 --> 04:51:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm looking at quite a bit of this
 
04:51:31.550 --> 04:51:31.560 align:start position:0%
at the same time you are for the first
 
04:51:38.750 --> 04:51:38.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:41.090 --> 04:51:41.100 align:start position:0%
so we're double checking that the second
 
04:51:43.430 --> 04:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
thing that you want to do before was to
 
04:51:45.708 --> 04:51:45.718 align:start position:0%
get rid of that whole opt-in out thing
 
04:51:48.410 --> 04:51:48.420 align:start position:0%
oh thing that's gone right that's fixed
 
04:51:50.930 --> 04:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
let's find that I saw it on a computer
 
04:51:52.850 --> 04:51:52.860 align:start position:0%
screen I'm not seeing it on paper for
 
04:51:54.650 --> 04:51:54.660 align:start position:0%
the first time
 
04:51:56.810 --> 04:51:56.820 align:start position:0%
hard to do this
 
04:51:56.820 --> 04:52:03.650 align:start position:0%
hard to do this
without

04:52:03.650 --> 04:52:03.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:11.750 --> 04:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:19.128 --> 04:52:19.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:22.128 --> 04:52:22.138 align:start position:0%
yes so the language is on the top of
 
04:52:24.288 --> 04:52:24.298 align:start position:0%
page 12.
 
04:52:29.930 --> 04:52:29.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
so this restores the language of HB 639
 
04:52:36.830 --> 04:52:36.840 align:start position:0%
which says municipality May enact an
 
04:52:41.330 --> 04:52:41.340 align:start position:0%
ordinance prohibiting or limiting IE opt
 
04:52:41.340 --> 04:52:42.470 align:start position:0%
ordinance prohibiting or limiting IE opt
out

04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
04:52:46.010 --> 04:52:46.020 align:start position:0%
the amendment had permitting
 
04:52:48.530 --> 04:52:48.540 align:start position:0%
and that's now been restored to the
 
04:52:54.708 --> 04:52:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:14.930 --> 04:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:14.940 --> 04:53:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:53:19.910 --> 04:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:22.730 --> 04:53:22.740 align:start position:0%
so F21
 
04:53:28.310 --> 04:53:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:28.320 --> 04:53:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
and

04:53:29.750 --> 04:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:53:31.610 --> 04:53:31.620 align:start position:0%
the amendment
 
04:53:34.490 --> 04:53:34.500 align:start position:0%
is changing the language that begins on
 
04:53:36.230 --> 04:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
page 19
 
04:53:40.430 --> 04:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:44.948 --> 04:53:44.958 align:start position:0%
this is the 15 50 for education
 
04:53:47.570 --> 04:53:47.580 align:start position:0%
reincorporating reinstating the language
 
04:53:51.770 --> 04:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
which instructs the dra to make the
 
04:53:53.810 --> 04:53:53.820 align:start position:0%
calculation of what the net swept
 
04:53:58.730 --> 04:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:00.890 --> 04:54:00.900 align:start position:0%
so you'll recognize that language from
 
04:54:02.990 --> 04:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
the original HP 630 where can you point
 
04:54:05.030 --> 04:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
to that language where is that yes sure
 
04:54:07.910 --> 04:54:07.920 align:start position:0%
on page 19. yep
 
04:54:12.610 --> 04:54:12.620 align:start position:0%
um the lines 17 to 23 so this is perfect
 
04:54:18.110 --> 04:54:18.120 align:start position:0%
five that Roman numeral five b one
 
04:54:22.128 --> 04:54:22.138 align:start position:0%
and what it does here is it it it
 
04:54:25.250 --> 04:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
takes the same first several words 50
 
04:54:28.670 --> 04:54:28.680 align:start position:0%
percent of remaining funds shall
 
04:54:31.868 --> 04:54:31.878 align:start position:0%
and everything beyond the word shall
 
04:54:36.288 --> 04:54:36.298 align:start position:0%
restores what was in HP 639
 
04:54:36.298 --> 04:54:37.510 align:start position:0%
restores what was in HP 639
okay

04:54:37.510 --> 04:54:37.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:54:40.788 --> 04:54:40.798 align:start position:0%
represent what yes I'm confused with the
 
04:54:43.190 --> 04:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
number of amendments we've discussed and
 
04:54:45.770 --> 04:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
the changes uh your language and this
 
04:54:48.350 --> 04:54:48.360 align:start position:0%
amendment on line six has two million
 
04:54:49.670 --> 04:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
dollars here of appropriate the
 
04:54:50.510 --> 04:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
commission for the cost of
 
04:54:52.368 --> 04:54:52.378 align:start position:0%
administration of this chapter did we
 
04:54:53.750 --> 04:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
stay with the two million or were we
 
04:54:56.930 --> 04:54:56.940 align:start position:0%
willing to change that so so this
 
04:54:59.628 --> 04:54:59.638 align:start position:0%
language will be superseded by
 
04:55:03.708 --> 04:55:03.718 align:start position:0%
representative homies amendment 1224h in
 
04:55:05.330 --> 04:55:05.340 align:start position:0%
that relevant part
 
04:55:08.208 --> 04:55:08.218 align:start position:0%
and her language regarding the
 
04:55:11.030 --> 04:55:11.040 align:start position:0%
allocations will be eliminated
 
04:55:13.368 --> 04:55:13.378 align:start position:0%
right so we're blending
 
04:55:18.170 --> 04:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:18.180 --> 04:55:23.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:55:23.150 --> 04:55:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:25.368 --> 04:55:25.378 align:start position:0%
after our discussion when we broke for
 
04:55:25.378 --> 04:55:26.448 align:start position:0%
after our discussion when we broke for
lunch

04:55:26.448 --> 04:55:26.458 align:start position:0%
lunch
 
04:55:30.410 --> 04:55:30.420 align:start position:0%
my cult from DHHS approached me
 
04:55:33.948 --> 04:55:33.958 align:start position:0%
and pointed out that our Amendment
 
04:55:36.470 --> 04:55:36.480 align:start position:0%
had de-linked
 
04:55:39.110 --> 04:55:39.120 align:start position:0%
the funding allocation
 
04:55:43.550 --> 04:55:43.560 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral five b three
 
04:55:48.110 --> 04:55:48.120 align:start position:0%
and that is on page 19 line 30.
 
04:55:48.120 --> 04:55:51.590 align:start position:0%
and that is on page 19 line 30.
from

04:55:51.590 --> 04:55:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:54.830 --> 04:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
the provision on the next page on page
 
04:55:59.690 --> 04:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:04.010 --> 04:56:04.020 align:start position:0%
through 16. so let me just explain that
 
04:56:07.190 --> 04:56:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:11.330 --> 04:56:11.340 align:start position:0%
the bill HB 639 includes this provision
 
04:56:17.208 --> 04:56:17.218 align:start position:0%
on page 2318 F 22 which creates a fund
 
04:56:19.310 --> 04:56:19.320 align:start position:0%
the Substance Abuse Prevention and
 
04:56:21.830 --> 04:56:21.840 align:start position:0%
Recovery Fund the original language of
 
04:56:24.830 --> 04:56:24.840 align:start position:0%
639 had a reference to that
 
04:56:28.368 --> 04:56:28.378 align:start position:0%
and so we've reincorporated that I'm
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
sure everyone will agree if now if you
 
04:56:33.110 --> 04:56:33.120 align:start position:0%
go back to page 19 I'll show you where
 
04:56:35.448 --> 04:56:35.458 align:start position:0%
it's Incorporated
 
04:56:37.788 --> 04:56:37.798 align:start position:0%
on page 19
 
04:56:40.670 --> 04:56:40.680 align:start position:0%
lines 30 and 31
 
04:56:43.070 --> 04:56:43.080 align:start position:0%
10 of remaining funds are 25 million
 
04:56:44.930 --> 04:56:44.940 align:start position:0%
whichever is less
 
04:56:48.110 --> 04:56:48.120 align:start position:0%
shall be credited to we've changed the
 
04:56:50.690 --> 04:56:50.700 align:start position:0%
reference Now by inserting the Substance
 
04:56:52.788 --> 04:56:52.798 align:start position:0%
Abuse Prevention and Recovery Fund in
 
04:56:56.770 --> 04:56:56.780 align:start position:0%
RSA 318f22 so this specifically
 
04:56:59.208 --> 04:56:59.218 align:start position:0%
designates that fund
 
04:57:02.448 --> 04:57:02.458 align:start position:0%
as the repository for this 10 or 25
 
04:57:07.490 --> 04:57:07.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:09.830 --> 04:57:09.840 align:start position:0%
does that make sense what was that okay
 
04:57:09.840 --> 04:57:10.970 align:start position:0%
does that make sense what was that okay
representative

04:57:10.970 --> 04:57:10.980 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:57:12.890 --> 04:57:12.900 align:start position:0%
good thank you
 
04:57:16.128 --> 04:57:16.138 align:start position:0%
um so can you just remind me I know
 
04:57:18.110 --> 04:57:18.120 align:start position:0%
you're putting it back to the bill
 
04:57:20.270 --> 04:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
language can you remind me what it had
 
04:57:23.150 --> 04:57:23.160 align:start position:0%
changed to to it was just unclear where
 
04:57:26.930 --> 04:57:26.940 align:start position:0%
the money was going before uh
 
04:57:29.090 --> 04:57:29.100 align:start position:0%
great question so
 
04:57:29.100 --> 04:57:33.110 align:start position:0%
great question so
639

04:57:33.110 --> 04:57:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:39.890 --> 04:57:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:41.448 --> 04:57:41.458 align:start position:0%
let me tell everyone has that so the
 
04:57:44.570 --> 04:57:44.580 align:start position:0%
main bill on page 22
 
04:57:47.390 --> 04:57:47.400 align:start position:0%
on lines nine and ten
 
04:57:50.390 --> 04:57:50.400 align:start position:0%
said simply 10 shall be allocated to the
 
04:57:52.128 --> 04:57:52.138 align:start position:0%
Substance Abuse Prevention recovery
 
04:57:56.208 --> 04:57:56.218 align:start position:0%
funds established by RSA 318 F22 and
 
04:57:59.270 --> 04:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
that's a direct reference to the
 
04:57:59.280 --> 04:58:00.050 align:start position:0%
that's a direct reference to the
um

04:58:00.050 --> 04:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:58:00.060 --> 04:58:01.670 align:start position:0%
um
section

04:58:01.670 --> 04:58:01.680 align:start position:0%
section
 
04:58:06.050 --> 04:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
that's just below on lines 19 to 25. 318
 
04:58:10.010 --> 04:58:10.020 align:start position:0%
F22 creates this Substance Abuse
 
04:58:12.590 --> 04:58:12.600 align:start position:0%
Prevention Recovery Fund
 
04:58:12.600 --> 04:58:15.110 align:start position:0%
Prevention Recovery Fund
now

04:58:15.110 --> 04:58:15.120 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:58:18.170 --> 04:58:18.180 align:start position:0%
what Roman numeral
 
04:58:20.690 --> 04:58:20.700 align:start position:0%
um what what the earlier provision the
 
04:58:23.570 --> 04:58:23.580 align:start position:0%
one on line nine and ten
 
04:58:27.170 --> 04:58:27.180 align:start position:0%
allocating the 10 percent did not do is
 
04:58:30.350 --> 04:58:30.360 align:start position:0%
say for what use are these funds being
 
04:58:34.368 --> 04:58:34.378 align:start position:0%
made it turns out that 318 F22 doesn't
 
04:58:35.990 --> 04:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
really get into
 
04:58:37.850 --> 04:58:37.860 align:start position:0%
what they're going to be used or spent
 
04:58:40.070 --> 04:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
for it just goes into the mechanics
 
04:58:40.080 --> 04:58:41.750 align:start position:0%
for it just goes into the mechanics
of

04:58:41.750 --> 04:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:58:43.310 --> 04:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
you know how the months how the funds
 
04:58:45.230 --> 04:58:45.240 align:start position:0%
are handled talks about State Treasurer
 
04:58:48.110 --> 04:58:48.120 align:start position:0%
and and deposits into the fund
 
04:58:51.530 --> 04:58:51.540 align:start position:0%
so so this basically Blends the two it
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
it keeps the language of the two sets
 
04:58:57.530 --> 04:58:57.540 align:start position:0%
Pillsbury Amendment that states
 
04:59:01.490 --> 04:59:01.500 align:start position:0%
what the funds are used for
 
04:59:01.500 --> 04:59:05.030 align:start position:0%
what the funds are used for
and

04:59:05.030 --> 04:59:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:07.070 --> 04:59:07.080 align:start position:0%
would you take a question representative
 
04:59:09.830 --> 04:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
Platt yes I see two million appearing
 
04:59:11.208 --> 04:59:11.218 align:start position:0%
twice and are they the same or different
 
04:59:14.030 --> 04:59:14.040 align:start position:0%
first page is on page first one is page
 
04:59:17.030 --> 04:59:17.040 align:start position:0%
19 line six sum of two millions here by
 
04:59:19.128 --> 04:59:19.138 align:start position:0%
appropriate the commission the casa
 
04:59:21.410 --> 04:59:21.420 align:start position:0%
administration of this chapter Etc and
 
04:59:23.208 --> 04:59:23.218 align:start position:0%
then I go to page
 
04:59:23.218 --> 04:59:25.010 align:start position:0%
then I go to page
21

04:59:25.010 --> 04:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
21
 
04:59:28.070 --> 04:59:28.080 align:start position:0%
line 12 the sum of 22 million for the
 
04:59:30.288 --> 04:59:30.298 align:start position:0%
biennium June 30th 25 is here but
 
04:59:31.670 --> 04:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
probably the liquor and cannabis
 
04:59:33.050 --> 04:59:33.060 align:start position:0%
commission for deposit on the Cannabis
 
04:59:34.610 --> 04:59:34.620 align:start position:0%
fund how they're the same or different
 
04:59:36.650 --> 04:59:36.660 align:start position:0%
and once the administration is one of
 
04:59:36.660 --> 04:59:43.670 align:start position:0%
and once the administration is one of
fun

04:59:43.670 --> 04:59:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:43.680 --> 04:59:44.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:59:44.810 --> 04:59:44.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:59:46.550 --> 04:59:46.560 align:start position:0%
um representative Platt I didn't keep up
 
04:59:49.490 --> 04:59:49.500 align:start position:0%
with you so I see the the 2 million
 
04:59:49.500 --> 04:59:51.708 align:start position:0%
with you so I see the the 2 million
um

04:59:51.708 --> 04:59:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:53.470 --> 04:59:53.480 align:start position:0%
for the biennium
 
04:59:56.628 --> 04:59:56.638 align:start position:0%
line six of page 19. you have 2 million
 
04:59:58.070 --> 04:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
hereby appropriate at the commission for
 
04:59:59.750 --> 04:59:59.760 align:start position:0%
across the administration of this
 
05:00:01.910 --> 05:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
chapter got that one and then the second
 
05:00:03.650 --> 05:00:03.660 align:start position:0%
one is online
 
05:00:03.660 --> 05:00:05.170 align:start position:0%
one is online
21

05:00:05.170 --> 05:00:05.180 align:start position:0%
21
 
05:00:08.510 --> 05:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
page 21 line 12 the sum of 2 million for
 
05:00:10.190 --> 05:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
the biennium is here appropriate the
 
05:00:12.170 --> 05:00:12.180 align:start position:0%
liquor cannabis commission for
 
05:00:14.628 --> 05:00:14.638 align:start position:0%
depositing the Cannabis fund okay so
 
05:00:16.788 --> 05:00:16.798 align:start position:0%
this is an appropriation provision at
 
05:00:18.650 --> 05:00:18.660 align:start position:0%
the end and both of these are superseded
 
05:00:23.990 --> 05:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:26.810 --> 05:00:26.820 align:start position:0%
okay so I I think we finally got the
 
05:00:26.820 --> 05:00:28.190 align:start position:0%
okay so I I think we finally got the
allocation

05:00:28.190 --> 05:00:28.200 align:start position:0%
allocation
 
05:00:28.200 --> 05:00:30.368 align:start position:0%
allocation
provisions

05:00:30.368 --> 05:00:30.378 align:start position:0%
provisions
 
05:00:32.470 --> 05:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
reconciled between the two versions
 
05:00:35.208 --> 05:00:35.218 align:start position:0%
representative Elber I just want to
 
05:00:38.570 --> 05:00:38.580 align:start position:0%
clarify that on page 19
 
05:00:41.510 --> 05:00:41.520 align:start position:0%
somewhere in uh
 
05:00:43.448 --> 05:00:43.458 align:start position:0%
Romans 5
 
05:00:46.970 --> 05:00:46.980 align:start position:0%
are we including startup costs
 
05:00:49.850 --> 05:00:49.860 align:start position:0%
in here because it says after deduction
 
05:00:52.670 --> 05:00:52.680 align:start position:0%
deducting appropriation charges for the
 
05:00:54.890 --> 05:00:54.900 align:start position:0%
administration of this chapter where
 
05:00:57.050 --> 05:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
does it say anything about
 
05:01:00.110 --> 05:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
having to return from the commission
 
05:01:02.990 --> 05:01:03.000 align:start position:0%
to the the state those startup funds
 
05:01:05.750 --> 05:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
sure so the answer to that
 
05:01:08.690 --> 05:01:08.700 align:start position:0%
is and and remember this has changed by
 
05:01:10.610 --> 05:01:10.620 align:start position:0%
representative Ami's Amendment but if
 
05:01:12.650 --> 05:01:12.660 align:start position:0%
you look at line
 
05:01:15.410 --> 05:01:15.420 align:start position:0%
six to eight
 
05:01:18.530 --> 05:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
that provision Roman numeral three ends
 
05:01:21.050 --> 05:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
with a sentence said some shall be a
 
05:01:23.810 --> 05:01:23.820 align:start position:0%
charge against the fund
 
05:01:26.990 --> 05:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
that's the phrasing that basically means
 
05:01:28.910 --> 05:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
they're borrowing from the fund and they
 
05:01:30.830 --> 05:01:30.840 align:start position:0%
will restore the funds when they have
 
05:01:32.628 --> 05:01:32.638 align:start position:0%
earned them when they've got a
 
05:01:34.670 --> 05:01:34.680 align:start position:0%
sufficient amount of tax revenue
 
05:01:37.250 --> 05:01:37.260 align:start position:0%
and one other quick question we've got
 
05:01:39.850 --> 05:01:39.860 align:start position:0%
the substance abuse and prevention
 
05:01:43.310 --> 05:01:43.320 align:start position:0%
Substance Abuse Prevention and I assume
 
05:01:45.590 --> 05:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
that somebody is going to need to get
 
05:01:47.708 --> 05:01:47.718 align:start position:0%
the language to be consistent between
 
05:01:50.150 --> 05:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
substance abuse and substance use or
 
05:01:52.850 --> 05:01:52.860 align:start position:0%
substance misuse so this bill throughout
 
05:01:55.670 --> 05:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
uses the term substance abuse
 
05:01:57.770 --> 05:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
and I think they're consistent yeah yeah
 
05:01:59.030 --> 05:01:59.040 align:start position:0%
and we're going to keep it like that
 
05:02:01.010 --> 05:02:01.020 align:start position:0%
although if representative Almy wants to
 
05:02:02.510 --> 05:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
do a floor Amendment or others want to
 
05:02:03.890 --> 05:02:03.900 align:start position:0%
do that to change it throughout the
 
05:02:05.868 --> 05:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
entire bill you can certainly do that or
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
at another time but it sounds like we
 
05:02:09.288 --> 05:02:09.298 align:start position:0%
need to discuss what is the right
 
05:02:10.788 --> 05:02:10.798 align:start position:0%
verbiage there because it seems like we
 
05:02:13.310 --> 05:02:13.320 align:start position:0%
have a little bit of discussion uh
 
05:02:16.070 --> 05:02:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative I sense that we may be in
 
05:02:17.930 --> 05:02:17.940 align:start position:0%
agreement with this with the changes
 
05:02:21.708 --> 05:02:21.718 align:start position:0%
that uh Incorporated by representative
 
05:02:24.650 --> 05:02:24.660 align:start position:0%
almi into the Doucet spillsbury
 
05:02:27.410 --> 05:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
Amendment before us and if that's the
 
05:02:29.510 --> 05:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
case maybe it's time for us ruffle well
 
05:02:32.150 --> 05:02:32.160 align:start position:0%
we have a few other items notably the
 
05:02:34.010 --> 05:02:34.020 align:start position:0%
tax rate and the make sure the
 
05:02:36.470 --> 05:02:36.480 align:start position:0%
definition of what the tax is upon
 
05:02:38.930 --> 05:02:38.940 align:start position:0%
exactly so now if you'll go to page 20
 
05:02:41.690 --> 05:02:41.700 align:start position:0%
of our new Amendment
 
05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:49.430 --> 05:02:49.440 align:start position:0%
318 F 23
 
05:02:53.570 --> 05:02:53.580 align:start position:0%
sets up the whole tax and that carries
 
05:02:56.150 --> 05:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
on to page 21 line three
 
05:02:59.208 --> 05:02:59.218 align:start position:0%
so this is a collection of changes that
 
05:03:00.770 --> 05:03:00.780 align:start position:0%
we have already discussed and I believe
 
05:03:05.270 --> 05:03:05.280 align:start position:0%
we achieved near consensus over setting
 
05:03:06.770 --> 05:03:06.780 align:start position:0%
aside the question of the rate itself
 
05:03:09.288 --> 05:03:09.298 align:start position:0%
but this is the same language we've been
 
05:03:10.510 --> 05:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
05:03:14.628 --> 05:03:14.638 align:start position:0%
with two changes that reflect the
 
05:03:16.310 --> 05:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
discussion we had this morning about
 
05:03:18.110 --> 05:03:18.120 align:start position:0%
representative fellow's proposed
 
05:03:20.030 --> 05:03:20.040 align:start position:0%
amendment and the language that was
 
05:03:22.430 --> 05:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
provided by representative Ames and
 
05:03:24.590 --> 05:03:24.600 align:start position:0%
you'll see that specifically with the
 
05:03:26.810 --> 05:03:26.820 align:start position:0%
addition of Roman numeral four
 
05:03:29.628 --> 05:03:29.638 align:start position:0%
and six Roman numeral four is on lines
 
05:03:31.850 --> 05:03:31.860 align:start position:0%
28 to 30.
 
05:03:35.208 --> 05:03:35.218 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral six is lines 33
 
05:03:38.448 --> 05:03:38.458 align:start position:0%
uh carrying over to the next page those
 
05:03:41.030 --> 05:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
two are new language based on this
 
05:03:45.470 --> 05:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:47.690 --> 05:03:47.700 align:start position:0%
all done
 
05:03:50.150 --> 05:03:50.160 align:start position:0%
representative Leighton
 
05:03:51.830 --> 05:03:51.840 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair I just wanted
 
05:03:54.410 --> 05:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
to note that um if we're using the
 
05:03:58.128 --> 05:03:58.138 align:start position:0%
entire Army Amendment 1223h it would
 
05:04:00.890 --> 05:04:00.900 align:start position:0%
also replace the change in the
 
05:04:03.230 --> 05:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
allocation of those tax funds right and
 
05:04:04.250 --> 05:04:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I didn't make that clear
 
05:04:06.590 --> 05:04:06.600 align:start position:0%
because we agreed that that Center
 
05:04:09.230 --> 05:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
portion of Representative almies would
 
05:04:11.570 --> 05:04:11.580 align:start position:0%
fall away okay and this would Prevail
 
05:04:16.430 --> 05:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:18.890 --> 05:04:18.900 align:start position:0%
thank you okay so now
 
05:04:22.128 --> 05:04:22.138 align:start position:0%
this amendment We Believe does the stuff
 
05:04:24.110 --> 05:04:24.120 align:start position:0%
we wanted to do so let's just take a
 
05:04:27.110 --> 05:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
straw vote on amendment to read the
 
05:04:49.390 --> 05:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:53.628 --> 05:04:53.638 align:start position:0%
representative sure while you're reading
 
05:04:53.638 --> 05:04:56.448 align:start position:0%
representative sure while you're reading
um

05:04:56.448 --> 05:04:56.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:59.390 --> 05:04:59.400 align:start position:0%
oh boy so many pieces of paper floating
 
05:05:02.030 --> 05:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:02.040 --> 05:05:03.948 align:start position:0%
 
uh

05:05:03.948 --> 05:05:03.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:05:06.470 --> 05:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
there were
 
05:05:09.410 --> 05:05:09.420 align:start position:0%
two very minor changes that uh
 
05:05:12.610 --> 05:05:12.620 align:start position:0%
representative Ames and I agreed on
 
05:05:16.128 --> 05:05:16.138 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral four we had previously
 
05:05:16.138 --> 05:05:17.090 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral four we had previously
said

05:05:17.090 --> 05:05:17.100 align:start position:0%
said
 
05:05:20.868 --> 05:05:20.878 align:start position:0%
the commission may determine
 
05:05:23.810 --> 05:05:23.820 align:start position:0%
the transfer price we've changed it to
 
05:05:26.750 --> 05:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.690 --> 05:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
in Roman numeral six
 
05:05:33.110 --> 05:05:33.120 align:start position:0%
we struck two words I don't have them in
 
05:05:34.430 --> 05:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
front of me at the moment but it said
 
05:05:36.708 --> 05:05:36.718 align:start position:0%
something like you know before and in
 
05:05:39.010 --> 05:05:39.020 align:start position:0%
the future
 
05:05:43.070 --> 05:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:45.470 --> 05:05:45.480 align:start position:0%
we struck the words expected or
 
05:05:47.090 --> 05:05:47.100 align:start position:0%
experienced so now it just says the
 
05:05:58.190 --> 05:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:01.070 --> 05:06:01.080 align:start position:0%
hey I guess 12.5 as a winner have been
 
05:06:02.690 --> 05:06:02.700 align:start position:0%
the whole thing as a winner
 
05:06:04.368 --> 05:06:04.378 align:start position:0%
I first of all I can't believe how much
 
05:06:06.110 --> 05:06:06.120 align:start position:0%
work you guys did awesome job
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
representative Ames and spilsbury and
 
05:06:09.948 --> 05:06:09.958 align:start position:0%
Doucette in particular have spent so
 
05:06:12.288 --> 05:06:12.298 align:start position:0%
much time on this thank you all right so
 
05:06:14.890 --> 05:06:14.900 align:start position:0%
before us we have straw poll vote on
 
05:06:17.810 --> 05:06:17.820 align:start position:0%
Amendment 1227 H if you're in favor
 
05:06:27.910 --> 05:06:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:33.368 --> 05:06:33.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:36.670 --> 05:06:36.680 align:start position:0%
only got two but I'm missing someone
 
05:06:39.650 --> 05:06:39.660 align:start position:0%
someone's gone okay so we have a strong
 
05:06:41.810 --> 05:06:41.820 align:start position:0%
majority there thank you thank you thank
 
05:06:43.550 --> 05:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
you so now what we'll do is we'll stop
 
05:06:45.650 --> 05:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
the work session we will ask
 
05:06:47.690 --> 05:06:47.700 align:start position:0%
representative spilsberry
 
05:06:51.530 --> 05:06:51.540 align:start position:0%
and whoever wants to join him to combine
 
05:06:55.788 --> 05:06:55.798 align:start position:0%
12 27 12 23 1217
 
05:06:58.850 --> 05:06:58.860 align:start position:0%
into one committee Amendment thank you
 
05:07:06.770 --> 05:07:06.780 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:08.448 --> 05:07:08.458 align:start position:0%
representative Elber
 
05:07:10.128 --> 05:07:10.138 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
05:07:12.530 --> 05:07:12.540 align:start position:0%
um just going back to my my little chart
 
05:07:12.540 --> 05:07:13.910 align:start position:0%
um just going back to my my little chart
here

05:07:13.910 --> 05:07:13.920 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:07:16.670 --> 05:07:16.680 align:start position:0%
um if we are going to have the 12 and a
 
05:07:16.680 --> 05:07:17.990 align:start position:0%
um if we are going to have the 12 and a
half percent

05:07:17.990 --> 05:07:18.000 align:start position:0%
half percent
 
05:07:21.650 --> 05:07:21.660 align:start position:0%
rate then we need to be taxing on at
 
05:07:24.650 --> 05:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
least 35 million dollars to be able to
 
05:07:24.660 --> 05:07:25.430 align:start position:0%
least 35 million dollars to be able to
cover

05:07:25.430 --> 05:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
cover
 
05:07:28.610 --> 05:07:28.620 align:start position:0%
the cost of operations that's number one
 
05:07:31.368 --> 05:07:31.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:33.948 --> 05:07:33.958 align:start position:0%
um whenever we get around to trying to
 
05:07:36.948 --> 05:07:36.958 align:start position:0%
cover the 15 20 million however much
 
05:07:40.910 --> 05:07:40.920 align:start position:0%
that's going to be in startup costs we
 
05:07:43.550 --> 05:07:43.560 align:start position:0%
need to figure that many more years and
 
05:07:46.368 --> 05:07:46.378 align:start position:0%
that much more Revenue before that gets
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
uh covered again and
 
05:07:49.680 --> 05:07:50.330 align:start position:0%
uh covered again and
um

05:07:50.330 --> 05:07:50.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:07:50.340 --> 05:07:51.708 align:start position:0%
um
I

05:07:51.708 --> 05:07:51.718 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:07:51.718 --> 05:07:53.448 align:start position:0%
I
think

05:07:53.448 --> 05:07:53.458 align:start position:0%
think
 
05:07:56.150 --> 05:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
that telling people that this is the
 
05:07:57.708 --> 05:07:57.718 align:start position:0%
rate now but we're going to need to
 
05:08:00.288 --> 05:08:00.298 align:start position:0%
raise it in three years because it's not
 
05:08:02.410 --> 05:08:02.420 align:start position:0%
going to cover what we needed to cover
 
05:08:06.128 --> 05:08:06.138 align:start position:0%
is going to be a pretty hard sell
 
05:08:09.470 --> 05:08:09.480 align:start position:0%
especially if it turns out that for the
 
05:08:12.530 --> 05:08:12.540 align:start position:0%
first couple of years the prices go up
 
05:08:15.890 --> 05:08:15.900 align:start position:0%
but then they drop as the program ramps
 
05:08:19.610 --> 05:08:19.620 align:start position:0%
up and our revenue is diminishing so I'm
 
05:08:22.310 --> 05:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
wondering whether we need to think about
 
05:08:24.350 --> 05:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
whether this is the right approach thank
 
05:08:24.360 --> 05:08:25.670 align:start position:0%
whether this is the right approach thank
you

05:08:25.670 --> 05:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:08:28.368 --> 05:08:28.378 align:start position:0%
well and you know certainly there'll be
 
05:08:30.110 --> 05:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
a majority report hopefully that comes
 
05:08:31.610 --> 05:08:31.620 align:start position:0%
out of this committee but there also
 
05:08:33.350 --> 05:08:33.360 align:start position:0%
could be a Minority Report that could
 
05:08:36.110 --> 05:08:36.120 align:start position:0%
express those concerns and I really love
 
05:08:38.510 --> 05:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
the amendment we have here which talks
 
05:08:40.550 --> 05:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
about them coming back to us and
 
05:08:42.470 --> 05:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
explaining what we're what they're doing
 
05:08:44.868 --> 05:08:44.878 align:start position:0%
so we'll keep an eye on it and we'll
 
05:08:49.788 --> 05:08:49.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:53.510 --> 05:08:53.520 align:start position:0%
we are in recess for our work session
 
05:08:55.550 --> 05:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and we're going to await the full
 
05:08:57.110 --> 05:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
committee Amendment merging the three
 
05:08:58.730 --> 05:08:58.740 align:start position:0%
amendments into one
 
05:09:00.470 --> 05:09:00.480 align:start position:0%
and then we will go into executive
 
05:09:02.510 --> 05:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
session as soon as that's hot off the
 
05:09:02.520 --> 05:09:03.890 align:start position:0%
session as soon as that's hot off the
press

05:09:03.890 --> 05:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
press
 
05:09:07.368 --> 05:09:07.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:09.230 --> 05:09:09.240 align:start position:0%
we're in recess from our work session
 
05:09:11.530 --> 05:09:11.540 align:start position:0%
and then we will hope as soon as that
 
05:09:14.570 --> 05:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
combined Amendment comes back to us we
 
05:09:17.448 --> 05:09:17.458 align:start position:0%
will exec it and then tomorrow I would
 
05:09:20.208 --> 05:09:20.218 align:start position:0%
really love to have the majority of men
 
05:09:23.208 --> 05:09:23.218 align:start position:0%
blurb and the minority blurb so that we
 
05:09:24.230 --> 05:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
can review them make sure they're
 
05:09:25.970 --> 05:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
factually correct and then get them to
 
05:09:27.830 --> 05:09:27.840 align:start position:0%
the committee assistant and get them to
 
05:09:29.448 --> 05:09:29.458 align:start position:0%
the house clerk because they're putting
 
05:09:31.310 --> 05:09:31.320 align:start position:0%
together all the moving parts for next
 
05:09:34.490 --> 05:09:34.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:35.810 --> 05:09:35.820 align:start position:0%
I don't know because we haven't taken
 
05:09:38.150 --> 05:09:38.160 align:start position:0%
the vote on the final final
 
05:09:40.970 --> 05:09:40.980 align:start position:0%
what is like the really the absolute
 
05:09:43.250 --> 05:09:43.260 align:start position:0%
deadline for getting a report in I mean
 
05:09:46.250 --> 05:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
you'd like it by tomorrow but if it's by
 
05:09:49.010 --> 05:09:49.020 align:start position:0%
Wednesday is that yeah but again you
 
05:09:50.510 --> 05:09:50.520 align:start position:0%
know keep in mind I have to review it
 
05:09:52.750 --> 05:09:52.760 align:start position:0%
you know so it has goes like yeah
 
05:09:55.250 --> 05:09:55.260 align:start position:0%
but if a couple of people are going to
 
05:09:56.448 --> 05:09:56.458 align:start position:0%
get together
 
05:09:56.458 --> 05:09:57.890 align:start position:0%
get together
then

05:09:57.890 --> 05:09:57.900 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:10:00.230 --> 05:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
and the reason we're not here the reason
 
05:10:01.788 --> 05:10:01.798 align:start position:0%
we're here today and not tomorrow is
 
05:10:03.050 --> 05:10:03.060 align:start position:0%
because I had the doctor's appointment
 
05:10:05.628 --> 05:10:05.638 align:start position:0%
as you remember so yes yes we're trying
 
05:10:07.368 --> 05:10:07.378 align:start position:0%
to get this done so we can you know
 
05:10:10.430 --> 05:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
drive here once basically
 
05:10:12.110 --> 05:10:12.120 align:start position:0%
um yeah I would love to get it tomorrow
 
05:10:14.810 --> 05:10:14.820 align:start position:0%
anytime tomorrow would be great just so
 
05:10:16.970 --> 05:10:16.980 align:start position:0%
that the vice chair and I can read them
 
05:10:18.288 --> 05:10:18.298 align:start position:0%
and make sure everything's just
 
05:10:20.510 --> 05:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
factually correct and then we'll send it
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
to committee assistant who sends it to
 
05:10:24.350 --> 05:10:24.360 align:start position:0%
the clerk a little bit more time we have
 
05:10:26.930 --> 05:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
it just helps but yeah absolutely by
 
05:10:30.590 --> 05:10:30.600 align:start position:0%
four o'clock on Wednesday is deadline
 
05:10:32.750 --> 05:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
thank you awesome so we're just gonna
 
05:10:35.208 --> 05:10:35.218 align:start position:0%
sit here now and go get some cookies or
 
05:10:41.090 --> 05:10:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:42.530 --> 05:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know I mean they've been working
 
05:10:44.208 --> 05:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
on this pretty closely and there's no
 
05:10:45.708 --> 05:10:45.718 align:start position:0%
one else in this building except for us
 
05:10:48.070 --> 05:10:48.080 align:start position:0%
and house finance so we are taking
 
05:10:50.930 --> 05:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
priority I think so I don't think it'll
 
05:10:54.288 --> 05:10:54.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:57.230 --> 05:10:57.240 align:start position:0%
do you want a definite time to be back
 
05:10:58.670 --> 05:10:58.680 align:start position:0%
do you want to give them half an hour
 
05:11:01.550 --> 05:11:01.560 align:start position:0%
well we can try if you could yeah
 
05:11:04.730 --> 05:11:04.740 align:start position:0%
definitely be back at quarter of five is
 
05:11:07.010 --> 05:11:07.020 align:start position:0%
that right yeah definitely be back by
 
05:11:07.020 --> 05:11:07.910 align:start position:0%
that right yeah definitely be back by
then

05:11:07.910 --> 05:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:11:09.830 --> 05:11:09.840 align:start position:0%
um but maybe sooner yeah sounds good
 
05:48:04.128 --> 05:48:04.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:04.138 --> 06:07:49.548 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

06:07:49.548 --> 06:07:49.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:54.170 --> 06:07:54.180 align:start position:0%
so we got our merged Amendment back
 
06:07:56.208 --> 06:07:56.218 align:start position:0%
including representative Rose shirt's
 
06:07:57.948 --> 06:07:57.958 align:start position:0%
language and representative almie's
 
06:07:57.958 --> 06:07:58.670 align:start position:0%
language and representative almie's
language

06:07:58.670 --> 06:07:58.680 align:start position:0%
language
 
06:08:01.190 --> 06:08:01.200 align:start position:0%
but in the process they misunderstood
 
06:08:03.890 --> 06:08:03.900 align:start position:0%
the way representative almies would be
 
06:08:03.900 --> 06:08:05.390 align:start position:0%
the way representative almies would be
incorporated

06:08:05.390 --> 06:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
incorporated
 
06:08:08.390 --> 06:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
so where we were agreeing to the first
 
06:08:08.400 --> 06:08:09.650 align:start position:0%
so where we were agreeing to the first
part

06:08:09.650 --> 06:08:09.660 align:start position:0%
part
 
06:08:14.030 --> 06:08:14.040 align:start position:0%
of F21 relating to the Appropriations
 
06:08:16.010 --> 06:08:16.020 align:start position:0%
and we were not disturbing the
 
06:08:16.020 --> 06:08:17.628 align:start position:0%
and we were not disturbing the
allocations

06:08:17.628 --> 06:08:17.638 align:start position:0%
allocations
 
06:08:19.490 --> 06:08:19.500 align:start position:0%
and then we were agreeing to the
 
06:08:22.310 --> 06:08:22.320 align:start position:0%
Appropriations at the end of the bill
 
06:08:24.770 --> 06:08:24.780 align:start position:0%
instead of they didn't understand us
 
06:08:28.070 --> 06:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
correctly so instead of modifying only
 
06:08:29.990 --> 06:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
the first part of the third part they
 
06:08:32.390 --> 06:08:32.400 align:start position:0%
deleted the middle part completely so
 
06:08:35.090 --> 06:08:35.100 align:start position:0%
the version we got back lacks all of
 
06:08:37.850 --> 06:08:37.860 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral five under F21 with the
 
06:08:40.490 --> 06:08:40.500 align:start position:0%
allocations so we've hit reset
 
06:08:42.230 --> 06:08:42.240 align:start position:0%
they're in the process
 
06:08:44.390 --> 06:08:44.400 align:start position:0%
I'm figuring 15 minutes since they've
 
06:08:46.010 --> 06:08:46.020 align:start position:0%
already seen the language it shouldn't
 
06:08:47.810 --> 06:08:47.820 align:start position:0%
be quite as long a review period as we
 
06:08:50.208 --> 06:08:50.218 align:start position:0%
normally have to wait
 
06:08:53.390 --> 06:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
let's paste it back in
 
06:08:55.610 --> 06:08:55.620 align:start position:0%
everything else checks out so far but
 
06:08:57.048 --> 06:08:57.058 align:start position:0%
I'm going to sit here quietly and look
 
06:08:57.058 --> 06:22:38.628 align:start position:0%
I'm going to sit here quietly and look
again

06:22:38.628 --> 06:22:38.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:42.310 --> 06:22:42.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:44.770 --> 06:22:44.780 align:start position:0%
good afternoon good evening
 
06:22:47.510 --> 06:22:47.520 align:start position:0%

seen on our previous look that uh
 
06:23:30.048 --> 06:23:30.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:30.058 --> 06:23:33.128 align:start position:0%
 
from

dual use certificates starting on line
 
06:23:41.160 --> 06:23:44.448 align:start position:0%
dual use certificates starting on line
10.

06:23:44.448 --> 06:23:44.458 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:48.470 --> 06:23:48.480 align:start position:0%
and you'll see when you look at uh Roman
 
06:23:50.930 --> 06:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
numerals two and three on line 16 18
 
06:23:53.208 --> 06:23:53.218 align:start position:0%
that then there's no longer a reference
 
06:23:55.070 --> 06:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
to the ten thousand dollar application
 
06:23:58.250 --> 06:23:58.260 align:start position:0%
fee or to the ninety thousand dollar uh
 
06:24:01.250 --> 06:24:01.260 align:start position:0%

06:24:01.260 --> 06:24:04.430 align:start position:0%
set up fee for a dual license holder
okay

06:24:04.430 --> 06:24:04.440 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:04.440 --> 06:24:11.090 align:start position:0%
 
on

06:24:11.090 --> 06:24:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:16.190 --> 06:24:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:18.890 --> 06:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
near the bottom
 
06:24:22.368 --> 06:24:22.378 align:start position:0%
you'll see online 30 that uh
 
06:24:25.490 --> 06:24:25.500 align:start position:0%
section F21 cannabis fund established
 
06:24:29.390 --> 06:24:29.400 align:start position:0%
begins and Roman numeral one and two are
 
06:24:29.400 --> 06:24:31.610 align:start position:0%
begins and Roman numeral one and two are
unchanged

06:24:31.610 --> 06:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
unchanged
 
06:24:34.548 --> 06:24:34.558 align:start position:0%
so over to page 19
 
06:24:36.230 --> 06:24:36.240 align:start position:0%
Roman numerals three and four
 
06:24:39.890 --> 06:24:39.900 align:start position:0%
incorporate the representative almi's
 
06:24:43.368 --> 06:24:43.378 align:start position:0%
amendment to put in 15 million dollars
 
06:24:44.690 --> 06:24:44.700 align:start position:0%
and five hundred thousand dollars
 
06:24:47.750 --> 06:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
respectively for the biennium in each
 
06:24:47.760 --> 06:24:50.090 align:start position:0%
respectively for the biennium in each
case

06:24:50.090 --> 06:24:50.100 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:53.150 --> 06:24:53.160 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral five starting on line 11
 
06:24:55.310 --> 06:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
and going to the bottom of the page and
 
06:24:58.150 --> 06:24:58.160 align:start position:0%
on to the next page has been restored
 
06:25:02.510 --> 06:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
has been found and so that gives us our
 
06:25:02.520 --> 06:25:05.330 align:start position:0%
has been found and so that gives us our
allocation

06:25:05.330 --> 06:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:08.270 --> 06:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
that includes the change we made on line
 
06:25:08.280 --> 06:25:09.708 align:start position:0%
that includes the change we made on line
31

06:25:09.708 --> 06:25:09.718 align:start position:0%
31
 
06:25:12.948 --> 06:25:12.958 align:start position:0%
to specifically tie the 10 percent for
 
06:25:15.948 --> 06:25:15.958 align:start position:0%
DHHS to the Substance Abuse Prevention
 
06:25:20.628 --> 06:25:20.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:25.910 --> 06:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:30.830 --> 06:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:34.510 --> 06:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
section F 23 has been
 
06:25:38.948 --> 06:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
changed to now be called the excise tax
 
06:25:43.430 --> 06:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
and online 18 and excise tax
 
06:25:47.330 --> 06:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
the other change in that Roman numeral
 
06:25:50.090 --> 06:25:50.100 align:start position:0%
one is 12.5 percent
 
06:25:53.030 --> 06:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:25:56.330 --> 06:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
and the other changes to section F 23
 
06:25:59.990 --> 06:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
are the addition of subsection Roman
 
06:26:01.250 --> 06:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
numeral four
 
06:26:07.310 --> 06:26:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:26:11.270 --> 06:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
so the Roman numeral 4 has to do with
 
06:26:14.090 --> 06:26:14.100 align:start position:0%
ascertaining the intermediate transfer
 
06:26:15.470 --> 06:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
price in a vertically integrated
 
06:26:15.480 --> 06:26:16.910 align:start position:0%
price in a vertically integrated
operation

06:26:16.910 --> 06:26:16.920 align:start position:0%

liquor and cannabis can commission I do
 
06:29:39.410 --> 06:29:39.420 align:start position:0%
think that the Liquor Commission is

quite opposed to this I am trying to get
 
06:29:44.390 --> 06:29:44.400 align:start position:0%

still true
 
06:29:49.788 --> 06:29:49.798 align:start position:0%

06:30:11.810 --> 06:30:11.820 align:start position:0%

06:33:07.310 --> 06:33:07.320 align:start position:0%
oplc dedicated fund remember that bill
 
06:33:12.048 --> 06:33:12.058 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:17.750 --> 06:33:17.760 align:start position:0%

06:33:22.190 --> 06:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
I can hear you when do you anticipate us
 
06:33:24.470 --> 06:33:24.480 align:start position:0%

06:33:28.190 --> 06:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
that after we get through crossover that
 
06:33:30.110 --> 06:33:30.120 align:start position:0%
next week I think everyone should take a
 
06:33:33.110 --> 06:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
vacation so the week of April 10th I
 
06:33:35.150 --> 06:33:35.160 align:start position:0%
will schedule nothing and then obviously
 
06:33:36.410 --> 06:33:36.420 align:start position:0%
the week after that we're going to have
 
06:33:38.270 --> 06:33:38.280 align:start position:0%
to start scheduling some Senate bills
 
06:33:39.590 --> 06:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
but I think
 
06:33:42.410 --> 06:33:42.420 align:start position:0%
we only have like 12 13 bills so it's
 
06:33:45.708 --> 06:33:45.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:47.628 --> 06:33:47.638 align:start position:0%
yeah I know we could but hopefully we
 
06:33:49.670 --> 06:33:49.680 align:start position:0%
don't have to we'll see I haven't read a
 
06:33:51.590 --> 06:33:51.600 align:start position:0%
