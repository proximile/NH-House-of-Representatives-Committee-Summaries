okay you all set
 
00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:52.860 align:start position:0%
okay we will now open up the executive
 
00:26:55.250 --> 00:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 220 establishing a
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
committee to study the regulatory
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
structure of charitable gaming and the
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:06.830 --> 00:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I move to retain house
 
00:27:10.490 --> 00:27:10.500 align:start position:0%
bill 220. is there a second
 
00:27:13.970 --> 00:27:13.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
and would you like to speak to your
 
00:27:19.190 --> 00:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
motion a few words uh this bill is a
 
00:27:21.830 --> 00:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
study bill that overlaps with a bill
 
00:27:25.250 --> 00:27:25.260 align:start position:0%
that the Senate is currently uh has
 
00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:27.840 align:start position:0%
actually acted on I discovered this uh
 
00:27:29.890 --> 00:27:29.900 align:start position:0%
morning that it has
 
00:27:32.450 --> 00:27:32.460 align:start position:0%
gone through two committees it's been
 
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:35.520 align:start position:0%
amended and it's uh now going to come to
 
00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:38.700 align:start position:0%
the house uh in its amended form it
 
00:27:41.090 --> 00:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
overlaps with this committee it's a it's
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
a commission rather than a committee but
 
00:27:48.049 --> 00:27:48.059 align:start position:0%
the charge is uh overlaps but is not the
 
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:50.940 align:start position:0%
same as the committee that would be set
 
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
up under house bill 220 so I think we
 
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:56.700 align:start position:0%
need to retain in order to assess where
 
00:27:59.269 --> 00:27:59.279 align:start position:0%
this one fits in and where the other one
 
00:28:01.490 --> 00:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
fits in
 
00:28:04.130 --> 00:28:04.140 align:start position:0%
other comments or discussion
 
00:28:07.730 --> 00:28:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
representative could you explain to the
 
00:28:11.690 --> 00:28:11.700 align:start position:0%
new members on here the difference of uh
 
00:28:14.149 --> 00:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
between a commission and a committee and
 
00:28:16.610 --> 00:28:16.620 align:start position:0%
how the house position would still be
 
00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:18.950 align:start position:0%
how the house position would still be
maintained

00:28:18.950 --> 00:28:18.960 align:start position:0%
maintained
 
00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.649 align:start position:0%
maintained
um

00:28:21.649 --> 00:28:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:25.799 align:start position:0%
well the uh committee is a committee
 
00:28:28.549 --> 00:28:28.559 align:start position:0%
um a joint committee of the house some
 
00:28:32.409 --> 00:28:32.419 align:start position:0%
Senate in this case that uh that it has
 
00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:37.620 align:start position:0%
limited uh uh a limited time span to
 
00:28:39.890 --> 00:28:39.900 align:start position:0%
address the responsibilities given to us
 
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
basically the life of the uh the current
 
00:28:42.960 --> 00:28:44.330 align:start position:0%
basically the life of the uh the current
session

00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:44.340 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:47.940 align:start position:0%
um and it has no members other than
 
00:28:50.450 --> 00:28:50.460 align:start position:0%
legislative members on it typically
 
00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.669 align:start position:0%
legislative members on it typically
anyway

00:28:51.669 --> 00:28:51.679 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:28:55.310 --> 00:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
whereas a commission is uh is a body
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
that often I think maybe always includes
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
additional members appointed from
 
00:29:05.930 --> 00:29:05.940 align:start position:0%
outside of the legislature and has often
 
00:29:09.250 --> 00:29:09.260 align:start position:0%
more a longer period
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
to address the issues given to it than
 
00:29:15.169 --> 00:29:15.179 align:start position:0%
just the time span of the session
 
00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:18.120 align:start position:0%
um and I'm sure there's an array of
 
00:29:20.750 --> 00:29:20.760 align:start position:0%
commissions an array of committees that
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
don't exactly uh fit into the Contours
 
00:29:26.090 --> 00:29:26.100 align:start position:0%
of that but that's the general idea
 
00:29:28.970 --> 00:29:28.980 align:start position:0%
um and in terms of
 
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
uh well I don't really remember the
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:38.090 --> 00:29:38.100 align:start position:0%
yeah I I'm assuming uh sir that by
 
00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:39.899 align:start position:0%
retaining that we can still establish
 
00:29:41.810 --> 00:29:41.820 align:start position:0%
position if it ever comes down to
 
00:29:44.450 --> 00:29:44.460 align:start position:0%
Committee of a conference so between the
 
00:29:46.970 --> 00:29:46.980 align:start position:0%
two bills so that we can if we have
 
00:29:49.130 --> 00:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
something that we disagree with them on
 
00:29:51.649 --> 00:29:51.659 align:start position:0%
absolutely and it's an entirely within
 
00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
our control assuming the commission bill
 
00:29:57.710 --> 00:29:57.720 align:start position:0%
is is sent to this committee we can make
 
00:30:00.350 --> 00:30:00.360 align:start position:0%
recommendations as we see fit uh with
 
00:30:02.810 --> 00:30:02.820 align:start position:0%
respect to both both bills
 
00:30:04.730 --> 00:30:04.740 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I just wanted to
 
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
clarification for individuals that
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
haven't run across that yet
 
00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.370 align:start position:0%
haven't run across that yet

00:30:10.370 --> 00:30:10.380 align:start position:0%

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
00:30:13.730 --> 00:30:13.740 align:start position:0%
um can you refresh my memory
 
00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
representative do members of the
 
00:30:17.389 --> 00:30:17.399 align:start position:0%
commission that are not part of the
 
00:30:21.730 --> 00:30:21.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
I think that needs to be put into the
 
00:30:27.169 --> 00:30:27.179 align:start position:0%
bill that mileage will be provided but
 
00:30:29.990 --> 00:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
it usually is but I don't know whether
 
00:30:32.110 --> 00:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
it usually is I shouldn't say that I I
 
00:30:36.049 --> 00:30:36.059 align:start position:0%
I've seen mileage provided for uh with
 
00:30:38.389 --> 00:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
with commissions but I can't speak
 
00:30:43.010 --> 00:30:43.020 align:start position:0%

00:34:27.530 --> 00:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair I'd like to make a
 
00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
motion to itl this legislation is there

representative Schamberg second
 
00:34:35.389 --> 00:34:35.399 align:start position:0%
representative orrs would you like to
 
00:34:36.770 --> 00:34:36.780 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion
 
00:34:40.129 --> 00:34:40.139 align:start position:0%
uh yes after doing my research I feel
 
00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:41.210 align:start position:0%
uh yes after doing my research I feel
that

00:34:41.210 --> 00:34:41.220 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:45.169 --> 00:34:45.179 align:start position:0%
House Bill 486 would harm our
 
00:34:47.930 --> 00:34:47.940 align:start position:0%
constituents more than help and it would
 
00:34:50.389 --> 00:34:50.399 align:start position:0%
make a tremendous change in costs we'd
 
00:34:52.909 --> 00:34:52.919 align:start position:0%
we'd have to spend a lot of money
 
00:34:55.070 --> 00:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
revising our system
 
00:34:58.609 --> 00:34:58.619 align:start position:0%
and the information provided by DLT and
 
00:35:02.089 --> 00:35:02.099 align:start position:0%
Department of Motor Vehicles DMV makes
 
00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:04.200 align:start position:0%
it pretty clear that the system in place
 
00:35:07.310 --> 00:35:07.320 align:start position:0%
now is very good and I think it'll be
 
00:35:09.530 --> 00:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
better once the automation process is
 
00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.230 align:start position:0%
better once the automation process is
completed

00:35:12.230 --> 00:35:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:14.640 align:start position:0%
other comments on the itl motion or on
 
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:35:17.870 --> 00:35:17.880 align:start position:0%
yes representative Platt one concern I
 
00:35:20.150 --> 00:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
had got resolved and I initially thought
 
00:35:22.250 --> 00:35:22.260 align:start position:0%
maybe the punishment didn't fit the
 
00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
crime but these are Prescott laws that
 
00:35:27.530 --> 00:35:27.540 align:start position:0%
have passed through tolls 10 times
 
00:35:30.109 --> 00:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
before any notice is sent out then they
 
00:35:31.609 --> 00:35:31.619 align:start position:0%
get all kinds of time for a second
 
00:35:33.890 --> 00:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
notice and then a third notice then it
 
00:35:37.730 --> 00:35:37.740 align:start position:0%
goes to the DMV and they get a uh 50 50
 
00:35:40.250 --> 00:35:40.260 align:start position:0%
fine after all of that and to me that's
 
00:35:44.470 --> 00:35:44.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee
 
00:35:47.099 --> 00:35:48.710 align:start position:0%
other comments from the committee
representative

00:35:48.710 --> 00:35:48.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
 
00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.410 align:start position:0%
yes thank you madam chair
um

00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:53.810 --> 00:35:53.820 align:start position:0%
I think we heard a lot of uh testimony
 
00:35:55.609 --> 00:35:55.619 align:start position:0%
and a lot of facts over the last couple
 
00:35:58.010 --> 00:35:58.020 align:start position:0%
of days on this and and I don't disagree
 
00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:00.660 align:start position:0%
with a lot of it what I do disagree with
 
00:36:04.430 --> 00:36:04.440 align:start position:0%
is does the punishment fit the crime uh
 
00:36:07.010 --> 00:36:07.020 align:start position:0%
representative Platt just uh commented
 
00:36:09.710 --> 00:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
on that and and when it comes down to it
 
00:36:13.010 --> 00:36:13.020 align:start position:0%
you could you could be a chronic
 
00:36:15.829 --> 00:36:15.839 align:start position:0%
offender and you could be somebody who
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
is ignoring the the uh notifications but
 
00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day we could be
 
00:36:23.569 --> 00:36:23.579 align:start position:0%
revoking and again I acknowledge the
 
00:36:25.310 --> 00:36:25.320 align:start position:0%
fact that driving is a privilege but we
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
could be revoking uh somebody's
 
00:36:28.849 --> 00:36:28.859 align:start position:0%
privilege to drive in New Hampshire
 
00:36:32.329 --> 00:36:32.339 align:start position:0%
based on an administrative uh two dollar
 
00:36:35.030 --> 00:36:35.040 align:start position:0%
or twenty dollar and five cent uh fine
 
00:36:38.650 --> 00:36:38.660 align:start position:0%
that they didn't pay now we we do
 
00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:41.220 align:start position:0%
restrain people and and revoke people's
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
ability to drive for things like drunk
 
00:36:45.650 --> 00:36:45.660 align:start position:0%
driving and reckless driving
 
00:36:48.470 --> 00:36:48.480 align:start position:0%
um speeding tickets paying a toll does
 
00:36:50.210 --> 00:36:50.220 align:start position:0%
not rise to that level
 
00:36:55.010 --> 00:36:55.020 align:start position:0%
and uh I don't think the punishment fits
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
the crime in this so uh I will be voting
 
00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:04.430 --> 00:37:04.440 align:start position:0%
representative Army
 
00:37:09.230 --> 00:37:09.240 align:start position:0%
thank you I'd like to reiterate that
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
the crime in in this circumstance can uh
 
00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:17.520 align:start position:0%
destroy our Turnpike fund
 
00:37:19.970 --> 00:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
and our Turnpike fund keeps the
 
00:37:22.010 --> 00:37:22.020 align:start position:0%
turnpikes going
 
00:37:25.370 --> 00:37:25.380 align:start position:0%
uh all of the the fines as I understand
 
00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:28.980 align:start position:0%
it are just about all of the revenue
 
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:32.000 align:start position:0%
that they get they have bonding
 
00:37:34.910 --> 00:37:34.920 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that the state also
 
00:37:37.910 --> 00:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
stands behind that
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
um they have to fulfill and if we
 
00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440 align:start position:0%
make it easy for somebody from
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts or Connecticut or Maine or
 
00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:52.380 align:start position:0%
New York to to come on to our Turnpike
 
00:37:55.550 --> 00:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
system and evade the tolls every single
 
00:37:57.050 --> 00:37:57.060 align:start position:0%
time they come
 
00:37:58.849 --> 00:37:58.859 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a lot more of that
 
00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
behavior and we're going to have a much
 
00:38:03.829 --> 00:38:03.839 align:start position:0%
harder time keeping our Turnpike system
 
00:38:03.839 --> 00:38:05.210 align:start position:0%
harder time keeping our Turnpike system
solvent

00:38:05.210 --> 00:38:05.220 align:start position:0%
solvent
 
00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.329 align:start position:0%
solvent
and

00:38:07.329 --> 00:38:07.339 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
satisfying the bond people so I think
 
00:38:13.130 --> 00:38:13.140 align:start position:0%
that it's a direct attack on government
 
00:38:15.710 --> 00:38:15.720 align:start position:0%
even though it's just one of a number of
 
00:38:18.349 --> 00:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
them and also they don't pay because
 
00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:21.060 align:start position:0%
they don't pay because they did not pay
 
00:38:22.910 --> 00:38:22.920 align:start position:0%
a twenty one dollar fine they pay
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
because they didn't pay a twenty one
 
00:38:27.710 --> 00:38:27.720 align:start position:0%
dollar fine a minimum of 10 times and it
 
00:38:29.630 --> 00:38:29.640 align:start position:0%
sounds like it's more like a hundred at
 
00:38:33.109 --> 00:38:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:35.690 --> 00:38:35.700 align:start position:0%
other comments yes representative ulery
 
00:38:37.010 --> 00:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
first point
 
00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:37.670 align:start position:0%
first point
um

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:37.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:40.250 --> 00:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
defines by the Turnpike Authority aren't
 
00:38:44.510 --> 00:38:44.520 align:start position:0%
not crimes they're civil penalties
 
00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.530 align:start position:0%
not crimes they're civil penalties
um

00:38:45.530 --> 00:38:45.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
that needs to be understood
 
00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:51.839 align:start position:0%
the incidence of DWI or DUI or whatever
 
00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:53.460 align:start position:0%
the hell you want to call it or speeding
 
00:38:57.109 --> 00:38:57.119 align:start position:0%
those are crimes uh from a violation up
 
00:39:00.710 --> 00:39:00.720 align:start position:0%
to uh class a felony depending upon what
 
00:39:03.890 --> 00:39:03.900 align:start position:0%
happens as a result of the wreck
 
00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
nothing in if this bill passes nothing
 
00:39:08.329 --> 00:39:08.339 align:start position:0%
would change with the ability of the

the executive session on House Bill 510
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
relative to removing the exemption for
 
00:42:37.370 --> 00:42:37.380 align:start position:0%
premium cigars from the tobacco tax the
 
00:42:38.690 --> 00:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes representative
 
00:42:40.730 --> 00:42:40.740 align:start position:0%
roachford for a motion thank you madam
 
00:42:42.170 --> 00:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
chair I'd like to make a motion in
 
00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:45.660 align:start position:0%
expedient to legislate for HB 510. so
 
00:42:48.770 --> 00:42:48.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
sure second representative Platt second
 
00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:52.970 align:start position:0%
sure second representative Platt second
step

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
step
 
00:42:54.410 --> 00:42:54.420 align:start position:0%
representative would you like to speak
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
to your motion yes thank you madam chair
 
00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:00.660 align:start position:0%
so this bill HB 510 would eliminate the
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
current tax exemption on premium cigars
 
00:43:05.950 --> 00:43:05.960 align:start position:0%
that is currently enjoyed in the state
 
00:43:08.930 --> 00:43:08.940 align:start position:0%
and if the repeal was eliminated a tax
 
00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:09.849 align:start position:0%
and if the repeal was eliminated a tax
of

00:43:09.849 --> 00:43:09.859 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
65.03 percent would be imposed on
 
00:43:15.589 --> 00:43:15.599 align:start position:0%
premium cigars now I think it's
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
important to realize that the premium
 
00:43:19.849 --> 00:43:19.859 align:start position:0%
cigars enjoyed a successful industry in
 
00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:22.260 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in large part because the
 
00:43:25.670 --> 00:43:25.680 align:start position:0%
exemption from this this tax results in
 
00:43:27.230 --> 00:43:27.240 align:start position:0%
business that comes in from neighboring
 
00:43:27.240 --> 00:43:28.130 align:start position:0%
business that comes in from neighboring
states

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:28.140 align:start position:0%
states
 
00:43:30.829 --> 00:43:30.839 align:start position:0%
furthermore this business likely would
 
00:43:34.730 --> 00:43:34.740 align:start position:0%
be lost uh to internet sales if the
 
00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:38.220 align:start position:0%
exemption was was pulled
 
00:43:38.220 --> 00:43:38.930 align:start position:0%
exemption was was pulled
um

00:43:38.930 --> 00:43:38.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
and currently only about 967 thousand
 
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
dollars is anticipated from this tax if
 
00:43:50.290 --> 00:43:50.300 align:start position:0%
it were to be applied to premium cigars
 
00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:54.480 align:start position:0%
representative Platt I that 967 thousand
 
00:43:56.750 --> 00:43:56.760 align:start position:0%
dollars is a static analysis I think the
 
00:43:59.210 --> 00:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
true number would be zero because people
 
00:44:01.430 --> 00:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
will just stop all the shops would close
 
00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:02.940 align:start position:0%
the business would be killed and they do
 
00:44:06.410 --> 00:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:08.630 --> 00:44:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative elberger
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair as I understand it
 
00:44:13.370 --> 00:44:13.380 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to be corrected if I
 
00:44:16.730 --> 00:44:16.740 align:start position:0%
misunderstand it this exemption was
 
00:44:19.250 --> 00:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
initially put into place because
 
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire had an actual industry of
 
00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:26.640 align:start position:0%
manufacturing hand-rolled cigars that is
 
00:44:28.490 --> 00:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
no longer the case am I correct on both
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:32.579 --> 00:44:34.370 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:34.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
um given that
 
00:44:39.829 --> 00:44:39.839 align:start position:0%
I look at the storefronts that I see in
 
00:44:44.569 --> 00:44:44.579 align:start position:0%
Nashua where they're empty because they
 
00:44:46.270 --> 00:44:46.280 align:start position:0%
have lost business
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
our biggest tax base
 
00:44:53.630 --> 00:44:53.640 align:start position:0%
taxpay a business taxpayer in Nashua the
 
00:44:56.750 --> 00:44:56.760 align:start position:0%
Pheasant Lane Mall is has lost somewhere
 
00:45:01.069 --> 00:45:01.079 align:start position:0%
around a third of its
 
00:45:04.210 --> 00:45:04.220 align:start position:0%
um income because of
 
00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:08.339 align:start position:0%
online purchases because people are no
 
00:45:11.270 --> 00:45:11.280 align:start position:0%
longer buying those things and I have a
 
00:45:12.790 --> 00:45:12.800 align:start position:0%
difficult time
 
00:45:15.530 --> 00:45:15.540 align:start position:0%
understanding why we are choosing this
 
00:45:16.970 --> 00:45:16.980 align:start position:0%
one item
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
to say we want to protect
 
00:45:24.829 --> 00:45:24.839 align:start position:0%
where we don't put that same kind of
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
effort or interest into protecting so I
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.069 --> 00:45:40.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:42.170 --> 00:45:42.180 align:start position:0%
yes Representatives thank you madam
 
00:45:43.670 --> 00:45:43.680 align:start position:0%
chair so
 
00:45:47.630 --> 00:45:47.640 align:start position:0%
my concern with this is initially when
 
00:45:50.390 --> 00:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony there were 30 or 31
 
00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.250 align:start position:0%
we heard testimony there were 30 or 31
cigar

00:45:52.250 --> 00:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
cigar
 
00:45:54.470 --> 00:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
retailers in the greater Massachusetts
 
00:45:58.309 --> 00:45:58.319 align:start position:0%
area when the tax came in to be
 
00:46:00.109 --> 00:46:00.119 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
the number of retailers in the cigar
 
00:46:06.069 --> 00:46:06.079 align:start position:0%
industry premium cigar industry was one
 
00:46:08.569 --> 00:46:08.579 align:start position:0%
they either moved to New Hampshire or
 
00:46:11.210 --> 00:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
they just went out of business and my
 
00:46:14.150 --> 00:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
concern is even though it may show a
 
00:46:15.829 --> 00:46:15.839 align:start position:0%
little bit of favoritism I'd hate to
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
kill the industry here whether it's
 
00:46:20.809 --> 00:46:20.819 align:start position:0%
manufactured here or not I guess in my
 
00:46:22.849 --> 00:46:22.859 align:start position:0%
opinion I hate to be driving people out
 
00:46:24.050 --> 00:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
of business
 
00:46:26.930 --> 00:46:26.940 align:start position:0%
seeing associate businesses surrounding
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
businesses take a hit financially also
 
00:46:33.230 --> 00:46:33.240 align:start position:0%
and what have we done well we've okay so
 
00:46:35.089 --> 00:46:35.099 align:start position:0%
now we've leveled the playing field we
 
00:46:37.970 --> 00:46:37.980 align:start position:0%
put the 65 percent tax on premium cigars
 
00:46:40.849 --> 00:46:40.859 align:start position:0%
but we kill it and I I hate to see
 
00:46:43.790 --> 00:46:43.800 align:start position:0%
storefronts like representative alberger
 
00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:46.260 align:start position:0%
is talking about just because we want to
 
00:46:48.890 --> 00:46:48.900 align:start position:0%
be I don't know fair or that we they got
 
00:46:50.510 --> 00:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
to take the hit because everybody else
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
is maybe it's time we change our
 
00:46:54.829 --> 00:46:54.839 align:start position:0%
thinking and cut these other uh
 
00:46:57.530 --> 00:46:57.540 align:start position:0%
retailers a break so that we don't have
 
00:47:01.630 --> 00:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
empty storefronts thank you very much
 
00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:03.470 align:start position:0%
empty storefronts thank you very much
representative

00:47:03.470 --> 00:47:03.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:05.930 --> 00:47:05.940 align:start position:0%
this is probably the umpteenth time that
 
00:47:08.510 --> 00:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
this bill has come up every two years it
 
00:47:10.970 --> 00:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
comes up now that doesn't I mean the
 
00:47:13.069 --> 00:47:13.079 align:start position:0%
sponsor has every right to bring it up
 
00:47:16.790 --> 00:47:16.800 align:start position:0%
again but after the 19th try with a zero
 
00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119 align:start position:0%
do you think the message will be
 
00:47:22.490 --> 00:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:24.470 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:24.480 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:27.420 align:start position:0%
Mommy I just like to repeat the history
 
00:47:30.829 --> 00:47:30.839 align:start position:0%
of this text because it was I that
 
00:47:30.839 --> 00:47:32.750 align:start position:0%
of this text because it was I that
exemption

00:47:32.750 --> 00:47:32.760 align:start position:0%
exemption
 
00:47:35.690 --> 00:47:35.700 align:start position:0%
because I started it uh
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
it was and I had heard nothing and I
 
00:47:41.089 --> 00:47:41.099 align:start position:0%
still have heard nothing except from you
 
00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
that there was one place that was
 
00:47:47.990 --> 00:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
rolling cigars here it is a very lowly
 
00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:48.970 align:start position:0%
rolling cigars here it is a very lowly
paid

00:47:48.970 --> 00:47:48.980 align:start position:0%
paid
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh occupation in
 
00:47:56.870 --> 00:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
the places where it is found and and you
 
00:48:00.230 --> 00:48:00.240 align:start position:0%
usually end up with a lot of asthma too
 
00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:00.890 align:start position:0%
usually end up with a lot of asthma too
um

00:48:00.890 --> 00:48:00.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:05.410 --> 00:48:05.420 align:start position:0%
but on it is there because
 
00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:07.250 align:start position:0%
but on it is there because
no

00:48:07.250 --> 00:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:48:12.170 --> 00:48:12.180 align:start position:0%
no tobacco except the cigarettes were
 
00:48:13.790 --> 00:48:13.800 align:start position:0%
being taxed
 
00:48:16.370 --> 00:48:16.380 align:start position:0%
and they had developed these sweet
 
00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:19.740 align:start position:0%
cigars which are actually uh
 
00:48:22.849 --> 00:48:22.859 align:start position:0%
cigarettes without paper around them
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
that are very light on Tobacco and are
 
00:48:28.730 --> 00:48:28.740 align:start position:0%
filled with flavors
 
00:48:31.370 --> 00:48:31.380 align:start position:0%
and they developed a number of other
 
00:48:34.430 --> 00:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
child friendly attractants and they were
 
00:48:37.250 --> 00:48:37.260 align:start position:0%
selling them in the pharmacies right
 
00:48:42.050 --> 00:48:42.060 align:start position:0%
next to the Coke or the Coca-Cola that
 
00:48:46.430 --> 00:48:46.440 align:start position:0%
is not cocaine and and um
 
00:48:49.430 --> 00:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
and toys
 
00:48:51.589 --> 00:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
and in places where you couldn't see
 
00:48:53.569 --> 00:48:53.579 align:start position:0%
they were shoplifting
 
00:48:53.579 --> 00:48:55.010 align:start position:0%
they were shoplifting
so

00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:48:57.890 --> 00:48:57.900 align:start position:0%
um I was trying to get after that and I
 
00:49:01.849 --> 00:49:01.859 align:start position:0%
decided to get after taxation of OTP
 
00:49:06.050 --> 00:49:06.060 align:start position:0%
other tobacco products and there was a
 
00:49:07.790 --> 00:49:07.800 align:start position:0%
very uh
 
00:49:11.809 --> 00:49:11.819 align:start position:0%
and Veteran smoker of prime cigars on
 
00:49:13.790 --> 00:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
our committee but more importantly there
 
00:49:16.910 --> 00:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
was an extremely important senator who
 
00:49:19.370 --> 00:49:19.380 align:start position:0%
was smoking uh
 
00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:24.420 align:start position:0%
on these cigars in the Senate that had
 
00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
was going to kill anything that came
 
00:49:31.130 --> 00:49:31.140 align:start position:0%
over to him that uh had those attached
 
00:49:33.890 --> 00:49:33.900 align:start position:0%
and that's why we put that in in the
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
first place but the other reason we put
 
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
it in was that not just one but for uh
 
00:49:44.990 --> 00:49:45.000 align:start position:0%
tobacco sellers uh came and stood in
 
00:49:47.750 --> 00:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
front of us and said we're here because
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
you don't have this tax if you have this
 
00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:53.640 align:start position:0%
tax we're we're going on the totally on
 
00:49:55.849 --> 00:49:55.859 align:start position:0%
the internet and or we're leaving the
 
00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:57.470 align:start position:0%
the internet and or we're leaving the
state

00:49:57.470 --> 00:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%
and we have no means still to be able to
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
collect this tax from the people who go
 
00:50:08.690 --> 00:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:10.790 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:13.010 --> 00:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and I'd also just
 
00:50:14.569 --> 00:50:14.579 align:start position:0%
like to point out that
 
00:50:17.150 --> 00:50:17.160 align:start position:0%
um I I do believe that um cigar bars
 
00:50:19.730 --> 00:50:19.740 align:start position:0%
would start closing and let's not forget
 
00:50:21.770 --> 00:50:21.780 align:start position:0%
that once that starts happening we also
 
00:50:25.130 --> 00:50:25.140 align:start position:0%
are going to see a reduction in m r uh
 
00:50:26.510 --> 00:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
tax from them because they're also
 
00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:27.829 align:start position:0%
tax from them because they're also
selling

00:50:27.829 --> 00:50:27.839 align:start position:0%
selling
 
00:50:27.839 --> 00:50:29.050 align:start position:0%
selling
um

00:50:29.050 --> 00:50:29.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:33.849 --> 00:50:33.859 align:start position:0%
drinks and some liquor and in some cases
 
00:50:35.930 --> 00:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
sandwiches or whatever else they they
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
sell so it's gonna m r would also take a
 
00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:39.230 align:start position:0%
sell so it's gonna m r would also take a
hit

00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
hit
 
00:50:42.410 --> 00:50:42.420 align:start position:0%
so therefore I support the itl motion
 
00:50:48.589 --> 00:50:48.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:48.599 --> 00:50:50.450 align:start position:0%
 
I did

00:50:50.450 --> 00:50:50.460 align:start position:0%
I did
 
00:50:53.210 --> 00:50:53.220 align:start position:0%
I too uh wish that uh this bill didn't
 
00:50:55.309 --> 00:50:55.319 align:start position:0%
keep up here in front of us but when it
 
00:50:57.230 --> 00:50:57.240 align:start position:0%
does I have to do what I think I should
 
00:51:01.270 --> 00:51:01.280 align:start position:0%
do which is vote against it and why do I
 
00:51:04.670 --> 00:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
uh vote a
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
vote against the itl I should say
 
00:51:08.460 --> 00:51:09.109 align:start position:0%
vote against the itl I should say
um

00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:09.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
and why it's because I I believe that it
 
00:51:16.069 --> 00:51:16.079 align:start position:0%
sends the wrong message that it singles
 
00:51:19.089 --> 00:51:19.099 align:start position:0%
out this particular way in which tobacco
 
00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:22.800 align:start position:0%
is consumed and uh says it's okay
 
00:51:25.190 --> 00:51:25.200 align:start position:0%
basically it takes makes it tax-free
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
whereas all other uh tobacco other
 
00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:33.480 align:start position:0%
tobacco being a a term of Art in this
 
00:51:37.730 --> 00:51:37.740 align:start position:0%
context is subject to text this one
 
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
premium cigar is not I think it should
 
00:51:43.849 --> 00:51:43.859 align:start position:0%
be we tax tobacco at a high rate for
 
00:51:48.890 --> 00:51:48.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:51.780 align:start position:0%
oh sorry I Twitter fiddling with my
 
00:51:51.780 --> 00:51:53.089 align:start position:0%
oh sorry I Twitter fiddling with my
hands

00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
hands
 
00:51:53.099 --> 00:51:53.990 align:start position:0%
hands
um

00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:51:58.730 --> 00:51:58.740 align:start position:0%
but I won't repeat myself uh the
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
argument I've heard the argument and I
 
00:52:04.549 --> 00:52:04.559 align:start position:0%
know it's uh believed by many that
 
00:52:07.970 --> 00:52:07.980 align:start position:0%
somehow the way in which uh uh big
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
cigars are smoked uh means less goes
 
00:52:14.390 --> 00:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
into your lungs or whatever and it's
 
00:52:16.970 --> 00:52:16.980 align:start position:0%
less harmful I've read a lot of research
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
on this I
 
00:52:21.950 --> 00:52:21.960 align:start position:0%
um I took my takeaway is that that's not
 
00:52:24.470 --> 00:52:24.480 align:start position:0%
the case that it's harmful
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
um and uh and so that's my position it's
 
00:52:29.750 --> 00:52:29.760 align:start position:0%
it's on the merits on the public health
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
aspect of this and that we shouldn't be
 
00:52:33.910 --> 00:52:33.920 align:start position:0%
singling out
 
00:52:38.470 --> 00:52:38.480 align:start position:0%
one particular form of uh of tobacco
 
00:52:42.349 --> 00:52:42.359 align:start position:0%
packaging and exempt it from tax thank
 
00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:44.150 align:start position:0%
