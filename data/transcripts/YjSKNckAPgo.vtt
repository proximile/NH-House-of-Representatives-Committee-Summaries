00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Thank you.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Thank you.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Thank you.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Thank you.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Thank you.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Thank you.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Thank you.

8
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Thank you.

9
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Thank you.

10
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Thank you.

11
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Thank you.

12
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Thank you.

13
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Thank you.

14
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Thank you.

15
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Thank you.

16
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Okay, I'd like to go ahead and just inform everybody on the committee as what's up or what's down today.

17
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:55.500
For those that were here yesterday, I think most of us were here, that we had the governor present his budget, and within the budget he addressed certain topics within education.

18
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.500
As you may recall, he mentioned the base adequacy, which is being jumped by about $1,000.

19
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:13.500
When you look at that in terms of where we're going, that's going to increase base adequacy by $150 million.

20
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:23.000
He also looked at the F&R, free and reduced category of differentiated aid, and jumped that by $20 million.

21
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:35.500
We've also looked at the weighted version for special education within differentiated aid and jumped that by about $20 million, from $63 to $83 million.

22
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.500
We're talking now stabilization.

23
00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.500
That's $150 million.

24
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:49.000
Stabilization built on this formula that we have or stabilization built on something that we have not yet seen.

25
00:01:49.000 --> 00:02:05.000
I spent a lot of time this morning over with LBA, and they do not yet have a spreadsheet which shows how this money sorts out in terms of local school districts.

26
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
That's going to maybe be presented by the department this morning at 10 o'clock.

27
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.500
And so we have three remaining bills that are early bills that have to be gotten out.

28
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.500
For 272, that's the funding for the charter public school.

29
00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.500
The governor's budget certainly implicates that as well.

30
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.500
It's all tied together.

31
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:45.500
492, that one we can do, that was the bill which we dealt with the statutory books that we are all anxious in receiving and having possession of.

32
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:59.500
And 529, which deals with the whole nine yards as far as, you know, the formula from fiscal capacity disparity aid to relief aid to extraordinary needs grants.

33
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.500
And there are a lot of implications associated with that.

34
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:19.000
We cannot take any action in here, at least I can't, until I have a better understanding of what's going on with the governor's budget and where we stand.

35
00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
And it implicates some of our policymaking, decision-making.

36
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:39.500
There's a lot of results that can occur from this, and I don't want to get into that right now, which would cause a lot of angst on the floor from various folks.

37
00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:49.500
So we need to really shoot our policy where we are to finance and really state some of the needs.

38
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.500
So we will be taking a recess at 10 o'clock.

39
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.500
Going down.

40
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.000
to finance and really state some of the needs.

41
00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.000
So we will be taking a recess at 10 o'clock, going down to finance.

42
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:19.000
Those who want to, I for sure, and I know Representative Luna for sure, Representative Cordelli, and Representative Myler will be there.

43
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000
Then we're going to come back and open up the exec session.

44
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:31.500
So we're just going to recess it, open it up right after lunch.

45
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.500
We have to have this report done today.

46
00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.500
And so we're coming right down to the line here.

47
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:50.000
So what I'd like to do is looking at that list of bills which we have for exacting today.

48
00:04:50.000 --> 00:05:33.500
See, tomorrow we can't exact right off because we have scheduled from nine o'clock to 11 30 hearings and that's in the calendar and then we would have we could exact in the afternoon but that we've missed the deadline so the only way we're going to be able to exact these bills and do it properly other than retaining them and and I don't have an inclination to want to retain them, we're going to have to do it today, these two bills I'm speaking of.

49
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:42.000
So there's going to be a lot of good, healthy discussion here today after in the noontime.

50
00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:50.000
So what I'd like to do right now is open up the executive session for 492.

51
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:57.500
492, would everybody please open your, um, I think we're fairly familiar with this bill.

52
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:06.000
We tried to execute once before and did it not to be addressing the early bills first.

53
00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Of the 16 early bills, maybe 17, the 492 and the other two are the only remaining bills.

54
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
492 first?

55
00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Yes, that's the amendment.

56
00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Okay.

57
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:39.000
If there are any amendments for 492 and 492 is requiring the Department of Education to provide the House and Senate Standing Committee's response for education with copies of the laws and rules relative to education.

58
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:44.500
The yellow books, the green books, that's what we're after here.

59
00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:49.500
So let's open this up to discussion purposes right now.

60
00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:58.000
And on behalf of Representative Tanner, Representative Lunell, you're recognized to explain what's in front of us.

61
00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:22.500
thank you very much um mr chair so um so i think everybody's familiar with house bill 492 which would require the department to provide uh house and senate education committees copies of the um everybody knows what So we're talking about the law books that pertain to education.

62
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:29.500
There's an amendment that Representative Tanner prepared, I think in coordination with Representative Ladd.

63
00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:32.000
And what does it clarify?

64
00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.500
It actually replaces the bill.

65
00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:51.500
So it removes the last sentence from the bill that says member of the House of Representatives so it just strictly relates to the department making these books available to the two education states.

66
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.500
And superintendents.

67
00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:55.500
Okay.

68
00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.500
Is there any?

69
00:07:57.500 --> 00:07:59.500
That's amendment number 2023-01520.

70
00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:01.500
Yeah.

71
00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.000
So we're in the discussion.

72
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:10.000
Is there any discussion on that right now amongst committee members here?

73
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.000
Representative Woodcock.

74
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000
Just a question, David.

75
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Yeah.

76
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000
Representative Luno.

77
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.500
I'm sorry, an executive session.

78
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:22.500
Yeah.

79
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:26.500
We've been reminded to use, you know, formal.

80
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.000
I'll accept the question from Representative Luno.

81
00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.000
Representative Woodcock calling.

82
00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.500
On the amendment, it says 60 days after passage.

83
00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:43.500
And we want a date in there because we're already done for this year?

84
00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:48.500
No, because this still has a long way to go.

85
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:52.500
It's got to go to the House floor.

86
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.500
Then it goes to the Senate.

87
00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.000
Actually, it will go to House floor.

88
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.000
Then it will go to Finance.

89
00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.500
And then it will go to House 4 again, and then it will go to the Senate.

90
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:22.500
It may have a scenic tour through the Senate, and by the time it gets to the governor's desk, you're familiar with Schoolhouse Rock?

91
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.500
Thank you, Chairman.

92
00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:26.500
All right.

93
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:28.500
You're welcome.

94
00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.500
Further discussion?

95
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:32.500
I'll second the end.

96
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:59.500
Well, we don't have a motion more discussion right now represent damon thank you mr chair um i have two things i have lind representative tanner's uh remarks from when she introduced the bill which i could perhaps review and summarize and then i'd also like to just state my vigorous support for this.

97
00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:05.500
So is that okay if I just use some bullets from Linda's?

98
00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:16.000
So Linda noted she's in, sorry, Representative Tanner, in her fifth term in the House, her fourth term on House education.

99
00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:23.000
And in the first three of those four terms, this book was readily provided.

100
00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:43.500
And as most of us who have looked at it know, includes the full text of Title 15 education laws and amendments enacted by the general court in the last session so every edition is updated from what has previously happened.

101
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:48.500
I'm going to just read this paragraph from Representative Tanner.

102
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:54.000
My educational background and career has been in education, not law.

103
00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:00.500
I was honored and excited to be chosen to serve on house education.

104
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:08.500
I feel my experience and knowledge of education is an important resource for this committee work.

105
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:17.500
While teaching, I often questioned and sometimes subjected to the regulations and rules handed down from the state.

106
00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:37.500
As a representative, I am now aware of how those rules and regulations are formulated and enacted with more understanding, but not without frustration of the lack of connection between what is happening in our schools and what we legislate.

107
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:53.500
Having information is essential to our job from listening to the people who are providing the services and education to having an understanding of the current laws and how they are applied.

108
00:11:53.500 --> 00:12:10.000
As a lawmaker on the Education Committee, I was and still am intimidated by the complexity of language structure and procedures of working in the world of laws, education statutes, and administrative rules.

109
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:34.500
I appreciate the tutorials from the Department of Education on certain topics like funding, but being able to have the annotated law book gives me the opportunity to look through the many education statutes, gain insight to the changes in those laws, and see some of the court opinions.

110
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:45.000
For example, I might look at the whole chapter on charter schools and see references to other statutes in other sections.

111
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:51.500
I can see opinions, amendments, and how particular laws had changed and when.

112
00:12:51.500 --> 00:12:57.000
There are court opinions cited that give context to the law.

113
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:11.000
The current website just doesn't give me that information or ability to look at parts of the education laws, both as a general overview or a specific session.

114
00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:17.500
As someone unfamiliar with the practice of law, I find this book invaluable.

115
00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:22.500
There are more remarks, but I think that is adequate.

116
00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:39.000
The point that Representative Tanner is making, and I absolutely agree, is that I've many times gone to the web and looked at the links, and I see the statute as it's written.

117
00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.500
But I don't see the background information that's relating to that.

118
00:13:44.500 --> 00:14:08.500
For example, if I'm going to funding and I want to know more about these Claremont decisions or the Londonderry decision or other such and how they apply to our constitution and apply to our funding, that's there in the annotated version, but it's not on the web.

119
00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:16.500
And when you're writing legislation, it's always wise to get as much information as you can.

120
00:14:16.500 --> 00:15:20.500
when we're writing legislation oftentimes we're doing that in in summer months and and and when we can't get that information out of out of here because things are closed down pretty much and you're not down here to begin with so i i i concur that we need to have the annotated version we need it in hard copy and we need to have that available to us when we want to research what's basically was the original you know law that supported this and perhaps some of that intent which we can take from you know court findings so that's my my take on this as well there is a cost to it but there's a you know know, we get paid, what, $100 a year?

121
00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:24.500
Yeah, I think we don't get a computer.

122
00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:27.500
We don't get all that other.

123
00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:35.500
And here we are now trying to make decisions based upon, let's have the annotated version.

124
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:39.500
So is there any other discussion on this?

125
00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.500
Yes, Representative Belcher.

126
00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.500
Thank you, Mr.

127
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.500
Chair.

128
00:15:45.500 --> 00:16:11.000
With some of what was just brought up brought something to mind as far as I'm trying to understand why we're looking to the executive branch to be doing this instead of perhaps trying to even provide funding if necessary to our own branch to bring somebody in to do this.

129
00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:32.500
Because it seems to me there could be a potential conflict of separation of powers if we're asking the executive branch to essentially provide us with information that would help explain our jobs to us in terms of how these legal precedents apply.

130
00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.500
The executive branch, i.e.

131
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:39.000
the OLS, are the ones providing us the books.

132
00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:52.500
Now as far as you want to track it back as far as who pays for the books, the state is going to be paying for it.

133
00:16:52.500 --> 00:17:01.000
Whether it's coming out of the DOE budget or it's going to come out of another line.

134
00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:21.000
But these books that we got right here, the green ones, are a result of ours saying we want them, and all of a sudden the box of the green books was found in a room, and we had them.

135
00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:41.000
So I think we need to have it in statute where this is provided, and when somebody comes on new here on this committee, it's provided so they can see what they're walking into, especially in the area of education.

136
00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:43.000
That's further discussion.

137
00:17:43.000 --> 00:18:07.000
Okay, so what we need now is to have a motion made represent cordell you want to make it uh thank you minister uh chair i would move uh ought to pass on amendment 2023 0151h and i'll second that okay is there any further discussion on this?

138
00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:09.000
Madam Clerk?

139
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Vice Chairman Cordelli.

140
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000
Yes.

141
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.000
Representative Luckes.

142
00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.000
Yes.

143
00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.000
Representative Ford.

144
00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:21.000
Yes.

145
00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000
Representative Belcher.

146
00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000
No.

147
00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.000
Representative Dry.

148
00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000
Yes.

149
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.000
Representative McDonald.

150
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000
Yes.

151
00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.000

For mental health.

00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.500
Thank you.

221
00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:04.500
Mr.

222
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:06.500
Chairman.

223
00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:11.500
I would move ought to pass on an in-house bill.

224
00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.500
We will go retain on that.

225
00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.500
Oh yes, I'm sorry.

226
00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:23.500
I would like to correct myself and make a motion to retain this bill.

227
00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.500
And I'll second that.

228
00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.500
Thank you.

229
00:22:27.500 --> 00:22:31.500
Do you want to speak to your motion?

230
00:22:31.500 --> 00:22:45.000
Just to say that there is a similar bill in the House, excuse me, in the Senate that some indicate might be better than this one even.

231
00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:52.000
So we can retain this and have this in our back pocket if needed.

232
00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.500
I think that certainly justifies holding onto this bill.

233
00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:09.500
With one of the senators over there yesterday, and the one coming at is seen by, I think, the Senate as also a pretty solid bill.

234
00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:46.000
So we may want to wait and keep this one in our pocket as we said that we can retain it if something doesn't happen we can take action on this in november so further discussion is represented with car represent what idea remember that bill i don't have that outside his office downstairs and and I didn't get the number of the bill, but yeah, it's one that he is involved with.

235
00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:48.000
Thank you.

236
00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:50.000

Okay, we're going to look at HB 382 at this point in time.

Pardon me?

299

Thank you.

305
00:26:49.000 --> 00:27:03.500
This is a bill authorizing local school boards to give students release time for participation in religious instruction in an elective course for the purpose of satisfying curriculum requirements.

306
00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:11.500
And you may recall there was a no-show here on this from the singular crime sponsor.

307
00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.500
Is there a motion?

308
00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:15.500

And Representative Meiler seconds that.

313
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:33.500
We have a motion on the floor to ITL 382 made by Representative Cordelli and second by Representative Meiler.

314
00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:35.500
Discussion from Representative Cordelli.

315
00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:43.000
I would just say, despite my fascinating introduction to this bill, I am moving ITL.

316
00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000
Representative Meiler.

317
00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.500

Representative Belcher.

321
00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:55.500
Representative Belcher.

322
00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:57.500
Representative Belcher.

323
00:27:57.500 --> 00:27:59.500
Representative Belcher.

324
00:27:59.500 --> 00:28:01.500
Representative Belcher.

325
00:28:01.500 --> 00:28:03.500
Representative Belcher.

326
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.500
Representative Belcher.

327
00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.500
Representative Belcher.

328
00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:09.500

00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:21.500
Representative Belcher.

335
00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:24.500
eccentricity of some of the introduction.

336
00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:42.500
It does appear that this bill is designed to actually bring us into compliance with the Supreme Court ruling that would authorize release for religious instruction that should be applied or should be applicable for credit.

337
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:56.500
So I do think the bill itself, the effect of the bill would appear to be good, despite some of the perhaps imprecise language in the legislative findings.

338
00:28:56.500 --> 00:28:58.500
Is there further discussion?

339
00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:00.500
Representative Petternell?

340
00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:03.500
I agree with what you're saying.

341
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:23.500
However, if I have this correct, local school districts decide what credits are some extracurricular credits that might be necessary or different credits other than what's normally required, if I'm saying this right, in order to graduate from high school.

342
00:29:23.500 --> 00:29:33.000
So students might get credit for this, and it wouldn't transfer to another high school should they change schools.

343
00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:35.000
Further discussion?

344
00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:37.000
Yes, Representative Dry.

345
00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:45.000
What's the relation to this to the similar bill that was introduced at the same time?

346
00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:50.500
Are you talking about the other bill that was almost identical?

347
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.500
Yeah.

348
00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:54.500
They're very similar.

349
00:29:54.500 --> 00:29:56.500
Okay.

350
00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:00.000
And what's the status of that one?

351
00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000
We have to act on that as well.

352
00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000
Okay.

353
00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000
Today.

354
00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000
Okay.

355
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:25.000
Is there any further discussion on authorizing local school boards to give students release time for participation in religious instruction in an elective for the purpose of satisfying curriculum requirements?

356
00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:33.000
should be noted that curriculum is that of the local school district and the school board.

357
00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:41.500
And what you're telling them curriculum is that of the local school district and the school board.

358
00:30:41.500 --> 00:30:53.000
And what you're telling them now is that this will supersede the responsibility of the school board who is issuing that graduation diploma.

359
00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000
So there is some conflict here on this.

360
00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:07.500
and I just believe that when we're looking at it, we're also talking about the minimum standards of public school approval.

361
00:31:07.500 --> 00:31:16.500
And we get into these areas that we are not the ones which should be dealing with that.

362
00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.000
That's a state board issue.

363
00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:30.000
So I also say the intent may be fine, but the outcomes and the results and the causations are the ending results.

364
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:36.000
We ought to be very careful on where we're going on this.

365
00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:38.000
Mr.

366
00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:40.000
Chair?

367
00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:42.000
Yes.

368
00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:51.500
The fact that this bill gives them authorization only to have release time, it doesn't really authorize the curriculum.

369
00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:55.000
For the purposes of satisfying curriculum requirements.

370
00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000
Representative Lekas.

371
00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:10.500
But it also says the State Board of Education shall adopt and each local Board of Education may implement a policy for the student to do it.

372
00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:22.000
And it says in grades where credit is earned, a student who participates in release time may earn, not shall earn, may earn.

373
00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:28.500
So it's still they can decide whether or not they did or not.

374
00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.500
We're just what basically, as Rep.

375
00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:38.000
Ford said, we're just we're saying we're authorizing the release of the student.

376
00:32:38.000 --> 00:33:05.000
but the rest of it it says I mean it's it's talking about the rules time it shall be credited with time spent that's attendance not credit and and they can't be released from a required core curriculum class it's just saying that they can and they're not going to be docked for it.

377
00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:07.000
That's all it's authorizing.

378
00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000
The rest is still the state board, the local school board, etc.

379
00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.500
still has precedence over all the other aspects, including granting credits.

380
00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:43.500
It's just saying you're going to let kids be released for this as long as they're not being released out of a, you know, core class, and you can't dock them for, you know, for missed time, which is really, we're the ones that came up with those rules anyways.

381
00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:45.500
Rep.

382
00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.500
San Cridelli?

383
00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:49.500
Thank you.

384
00:33:49.500 --> 00:34:03.500
I would just look at line nine on page two and that you're correct that there should be a policy to attend release time as an elective course.

385
00:34:03.500 --> 00:34:13.000
So we're saying it's release time for an elective course that would be provided by someone outside school personnel.

386
00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:22.500
But it is saying it's an elective course is to be granted for this in my reading of it.

387
00:34:22.500 --> 00:34:24.500
Representative Damon.

388
00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.500
Thank you, Mr.

389
00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.500
Chair.

390
00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.500
I have several concerns and I support the ITL motion.

391
00:34:33.500 --> 00:34:58.500
So on the first page of the bill, lines 17 and 18, suggests to me that we already have this covered anyway because it says the United States Constitution and the state law allows local school districts to offer religious least time education for the benefit of public school students.

392
00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:03.000
So it seems to me we already have this.

393
00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.500
Secondly, same page, lines 22 to 24.

394
00:35:06.500 --> 00:35:12.000
That is not language that I think belongs in an RSA.

395
00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.500
And thirdly, I'm quite concerned.

396
00:35:14.500 --> 00:35:23.500
This is different from a, for example, comparative religion class that could have great merit in a curriculum.

397
00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:32.500
This is saying we will release students for them to receive religious education in their particular belief system.

398
00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:38.500
And I don't think that that belongs during the public school day.

399
00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.000
There's plenty of other time for that.

400
00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:53.500
I'm concerned about what these students will be missing when they're off having their catechism or learning the Torah or whatever they're doing.

401
00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.000
So I very much support the ITL.

402
00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.000
Thank you.

403
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000
Professor Myler?

404
00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:15.000
I know I was late to this hearing, but the brief notes I have, am I incorrect that the bill's sponsor said that we should ITL this bill?

405
00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.500
That's what my notes say.

406
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:19.500
Is that correct?

407
00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:25.000
I've spoken to the prime sponsor, and that was his wish.

408
00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000
Thank you very much.

409
00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000
Thank you.

410
00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.500
May I elaborate on that?

411
00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:44.000
Because it was my understanding through the email I received that one of them had wanted ITL so the other identical bill could be heard.

412
00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000
Representative Cordiello?

413
00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000
Yes.

414
00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000
I'd just like a little clarity.

415
00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000
I'm trying to understand this bill.

416
00:36:54.000 --> 00:37:25.000
so if someone could help me with that as far as I'm trying to think of a hypothetical situation in which, for instance, if a student wanted to take a course offered at a Catholic high school, let's say, so this would allow them the time to go do that during the public school day if they went to a public school.

417
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.500
Am I correct on that?

418
00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:36.000
I'm just looking for clarity because there hasn't been a lot of time to do in-depth research.

419
00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000
That's already permissible.

420
00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.500
You can do that working with the administration and the buildings.

421
00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:45.500
That does occur.

422
00:37:45.500 --> 00:37:48.500
So that's covered by another law?

423
00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:50.500
Yes, sure it does.

424
00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:52.500
Okay.

425
00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:57.000
So what is the need for this, the hypothetical?

426
00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.500
Just any clarity anyone could offer, please.

427
00:38:00.500 --> 00:38:02.500
Representative Pentanel?

428
00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:21.000
I've spoken with the sponsors of each of these bills, and neither one of them wish to move these forward, and I tried to make that happen, but apparently I didn't talk to everybody on the committee.

429
00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:33.500
And one other note there, if you look in the analysis of the bill, the bill requires the State Board of Education to adopt rules.

430
00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:45.000
So there is going to be some expense to all this, and I'm trying to find out where it says in the analysis.

431
00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000
I don't see any mention of the 541A in here.

432
00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.500
So there are going to have to be some rules developed.

433
00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:01.500
So I think that the bill does have some sloppiness within it.

434
00:39:01.500 --> 00:39:04.000
The language was pointed out.

435
00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:13.500
But it also doesn't say where the rules have to be made, as far as I haven't found yet.

436
00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:24.500
So if the sponsors indicated that the bill shouldn't go forward, and the sponsor wasn't even here to introduce it, Thank you.

437
00:39:24.500 --> 00:39:26.500
bound yet.

438
00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:43.500
So, and if the sponsors indicated that the bill shouldn't go forward and the sponsor wasn't even here to introduce it, I would think that we would, you know, not, yeah, yeah, support it.

439
00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:46.500
Is there further discussion on this?

440
00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:50.500
Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?

441
00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.500
Vice Chairman Cordelli.

442
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.500
Yes.

443
00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.500
Representative Lekas.

444
00:39:56.500 --> 00:39:58.500
Yes.

445
00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:00.500
Representative Ford.

446
00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.500
Yes.

447
00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:04.500
Representative Belcher.

448
00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:06.500
Yes.

449
00:40:06.500 --> 00:40:08.500
Representative Dry.

450
00:40:08.500 --> 00:40:10.500
Yes.

451
00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:12.500
Representative McDonnell.

452
00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:14.500
Yes.

453
00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:16.500
Representative Noble.

454
00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:18.500
Yes.

455
00:40:18.500 --> 00:40:20.500
Representative Petternnell.

456
00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:22.500
Yes.

457
00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:24.500
Representative Cortella.

458
00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.500
Yes.

459
00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:28.500
Representative Myler.

460
00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:30.500
Yes.

461
00:40:30.500 --> 00:40:32.500
Representative Cornell.

462
00:40:32.500 --> 00:40:34.500
Yes.

463
00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:36.500
Representative Lane.

464
00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:38.500
Yes.

465
00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.500
Representative Luna.

466
00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:42.500
Yes.

467
00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:44.500
Representative Ellison.

468
00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:46.500
Yes.

469
00:40:46.500 --> 00:40:48.500
Representative Woodcock.

470
00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:50.500
Yes.

471
00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:52.500
Representative Hall.

472
00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:54.500
Yes.

473
00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.500
Representative Balboni.

474
00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.500
Yes.

475
00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.500
Representative Kaskadon.

476
00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:02.500
Yes.

477
00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.500
Representative Damon.

478
00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:06.500
Yes.

479
00:41:06.500 --> 00:41:08.500
Chairman Lett.

480
00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:10.500
Yes.

481
00:41:10.500 --> 00:41:12.500
20 a's.

482
00:41:12.500 --> 00:41:14.500
Zero nays.

483
00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:16.500
Yes.

484
00:41:16.500 --> 00:41:24.500
We have 634, but we're rolling in here, getting pretty close to this 10 o'clock hearing.

485
00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:28.500
That's really what we have to attend to.

486
00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:39.500
So we can take up the other bill, 634, when we do the other exec sessions, which will probably follow this afternoon.

487
00:41:39.500 --> 00:42:13.500
So what we're going to do is we're going to take a break right now to attend this finance meeting at 10 o'clock and then we'll come back and we will pick this recess up as soon as that completes down there we may have our answers done let's say at 11 o'clock and there's no sense to have to wait to 1 o'clock to pick that up.

488
00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:22.500
So we will pick this back up today upon completion of the education portion of the budget presentation.

489
00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:24.500
So we're in recess.

490
00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:28.500
Big room at the end of the hall.

491
00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:30.500
We all do that.

492
00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:50.000
What to that what we all well you're free to go anywhere you want right now oh no it's why it's necessary if they go and come back and tell us i'll believe what they said we're in recess.

493
00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:52.000
Oh, well, look.

494
00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000
Back to the thought.

495
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.500
Follow the thought of here.

496
00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.500
Yeah.

497
00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.500
Right here.

498
00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:02.500
Can you pin it?

499
00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.500
Okay.

500
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:06.500
That was some details.

501
00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:08.500
Okay.

502
00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.500
What was the vote?

503

I'm going to take a few minutes.

705
00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:34.000
I'm going to take a few minutes.

706
00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.500
I'm going to take a few minutes.

707
00:50:37.500 --> 00:50:41.000
I'm going to take a few minutes.

708
00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.500
I'm going to take a few minutes.

709
00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:48.000
I'm going to take a few minutes.

710
00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.500
I'm going to take a few minutes.

711
00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:55.000
I'm going to take a few minutes.

712
00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.500
I'm going to take a few minutes.

713
00:50:58.500 --> 00:51:06.500
I'm going a great deal this morning and yesterday that's got to be taken into account.

714
00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:17.000
So 529 is relative to additional aid grants for schools based on free and reduced price meals and fiscal capacity disparity.

715
00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:21.500
So I'm opening it up to discussion right now.

716
00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:28.500
Are there any amendments available for this particular bill that we should all have?

717
00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:31.500
You want me to address that?

718
00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:34.000
Thank you very much, Mr.

719
00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000
Chair.

720
00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:41.000
We do have a couple of amendments to bring forward.

721
00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000
However, they're still in legislative services right now.

722
00:51:45.000 --> 00:52:03.500
We may have them, certainly hope to have them very shortly, but I could print off a, I could make copies of what legislative services has for draft, make some copies of that, and the finance copier.

723
00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:05.500
That would be helpful.

724
00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:11.500
And then with those we can have some general some general discussion.

725
00:52:11.500 --> 00:52:13.500
Right.

726
00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:18.500
And I'll just sort of speak to it right now.

727
00:52:18.500 --> 00:52:22.000
There are some technical corrections on it.

728
00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:28.500
Added an accountability section based on some discussions I had with the chair.

729
00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:44.000
And although it seemed like the governor this morning was talking about not having an accountability, but whatever, and extending it to both FY24 and FY25, as the governor has done.

730
00:52:44.000 --> 00:52:52.500
And so it's essentially the fiscal capacity disparity aid plus pre- and reduced price lunch enhanced aid.

731
00:52:52.500 --> 00:52:57.500
Total package coming in at about $100 million each year.

732
00:52:57.500 --> 00:53:13.000
And it would obviously go to the school districts and the municipalities that have lower than average equalized property valuation per pupil and higher rates of free and reduced-price lunch students.

733
00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:19.500
But I'll print that off now and be back in a couple minutes.

734
00:53:19.500 --> 00:53:28.000
We're going to do the charter next because I've got to get the amendment to all those.

735
00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:34.000
Yeah, and while we're discussing 529, we will also be discussing 272.

736
00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:41.000
bills bills are dealing with, both are early bills, and they are linked together.

737
00:53:41.000 --> 00:53:50.500
And so we are wanting to discuss that, and seeing we're in executive session, we're discussing both these bills.

738
00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:56.500
If we need to be discussing both interchangeably, we will do so.

739
00:53:56.500 --> 00:54:02.500
So we can get to an answer or a conclusion today, hopefully.

740
00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:04.500
Yes, Representative Lekas.

741
00:54:04.500 --> 00:54:30.500
Would it be allowable at this point to introduce an amendment that has a completely different way of figuring out additional aid grants, but not based on free and reduced price meals and fiscal disparity capacity, or would we have to wait until next year and do it as a new bill?

742
00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:38.000
Because it's still dealing with additional aid grants, just a different way of determining them.

743
00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:45.500
What is the, I don't know what we can and can't do at this point.

744
00:54:45.500 --> 00:54:54.500
At this point in time, we have to address the basic concepts that are within these two bills.

745
00:54:54.500 --> 00:55:12.500
If you have a different process, there's a lot of different ways to be looking at how we're going to be doing all this, and I would suggest that that be done working directly with finance.

746
00:55:12.500 --> 00:55:18.000
I can tell you that I've been in so many meetings.

747
00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:32.000
Just about maybe 10 minutes ago, I walked down the hallway and had a discussion with the chair of finance and the division chairs, and especially Division 2.

748
00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:49.000
If there's going to be any kind of a policy decision that they're going to have to make, they're going to engage this group right here, this committee, before they go forward to HB2.

749
00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.500
Now, that's a real give to us.

750
00:55:52.500 --> 00:56:08.500
And so they're really open to communicating and trying to make sure that they can get things done in a way that they're going to have maybe a broad brush type support.

751
00:56:08.500 --> 00:56:44.000
because can i can can i know because i had talked to mark and i'm going to continue talking to mark and the next thing i want is a comparison between uh what are the supposedly poor time i you know based on, right, based on fiscal capacity disparity, based on reduced price meals, and based on Medicaid, because he said they can get us the Medicaid numbers for each town.

752
00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:54.000
And we could use the Medicaid numbers instead of these others to get an idea of poverty in a town.

753
00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000
And that is something they can give us.

754
00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:09.000
And so I'm wondering if that, and I would like to see all three, I mean, if they all correlate, that's awesome.

755
00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:17.500
But if they don't, if they're different, then we got to worry about what represents reality better.

756
00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:21.500
So we're talking about Medicaid direct here now.

757
00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:23.500
No, I was, no.

758
00:57:23.500 --> 00:57:26.500
You're talking about eligibility through Medicaid.

759
00:57:26.500 --> 00:57:28.500
No, no, not that.

760
00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:32.000
Not free and reduced lunch through Medicaid.

761
00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:38.000
Medicaid can't give us that unless we go through the federal government.

762
00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:49.500
Medicaid can give us the number, just the number not attached to people, of how many people in a town are on Medicaid.

763
00:57:49.500 --> 00:57:58.000
It can give us that, and that should be a good indicator of poverty in a town.

764
00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.500
And that's what we're looking for, is indicators of poverty in a town.

765
00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:09.000
That's why we have free and reduced price meals.

766
00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.500
That's why we're using that.

767
00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:14.500
That's why we have fiscal capacity.

768
00:58:14.500 --> 00:58:25.000
So where you are, you're in a whole different ballgame here as far as discerning how we're going to do this.

769
00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.000
We're limited with time right now.

770
00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:33.500
Medicaid is working off the census data, which is oftentimes regional.

771
00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:40.500
and if you came to me and saying, would you go along with that?

772
00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:46.000
The census data for Drafton County is like counties within counties.

773
00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000
I know.

774
00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:51.500
I'm not talking about the census data.

775
00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:58.000
I'm talking about the actual number of people enrolled in Medicaid per town.

776
00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:02.000
They are allowed to give us that information.

777
00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:18.500
They cannot give us who they are, so we can't do the mapping to the students, but they are allowed to give us how many people per town are actually enrolled in Medicaid.

778
00:59:18.500 --> 00:59:26.500
And it seems like that would give us a good indicator of poverty in a town.

779
00:59:26.500 --> 00:59:32.500
So where you are right now, you're using a whole different format.

780
00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:37.500
And we're in the process right now of developing budgets.

781
00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.000
It's basically a little late.

782
00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:44.000
You might talk directly with finance on that.

783
00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:53.000
But for us to start changing gears here, we would be building something on data we don't have.

784
00:59:53.000 --> 01:00:00.500
So I will continue getting that data and I will put it before finance then.

785
01:00:00.500 --> 01:00:02.500
Good.

786
01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:07.000
Can I ask a question about 272, Chair Ladd?

787
01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:09.000
Yes.

788
01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:18.000
I know that the increase for the charters, according to 272, brings them up to 5,141, I think.

789
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:23.000
Do you know the number for what the governor said?

790
01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:33.000
The governor is proposing 4,000 plus for, I'm pulling my book out here, for the adequacy formula, for base adequ.

791
01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:47.000
And taking into account the CPI as well, but each year, but I just want to compare what, what this bill says and what the governor is saying.

792
01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:51.000
He's trying to get the $9,000, I believe.

793
01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:53.000
Total..

794
01:00:53.000 --> 01:01:01.000
The amount of money which base would be is up around four thousand eight hundred dollars.

795
01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:05.000
I'm giving a rough ballpark figure right there.

796
01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000
OK, that's the 20 call it.

797
01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.500
Twenty four percent is when I think it's closer to twenty five of so increase.

798
01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:26.000
So if it's $4,800 and we're talking about a number which she has is $5,000-something, adding those together, you're coming over.

799
01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:38.500
I think Representative Cordelli is considering trying to make an amendment for a cost figure which would take it to that nine without going over.

800
01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:47.000
So it means we'd have to reduce some of the money that's allocated in the 272 bill.

801
01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:53.500
Rather than being at the 5,000 something, maybe whatever would be lesser amount.

802
01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:55.500
I can't mention that.

803
01:01:55.500 --> 01:01:57.500
Yes.

804
01:01:57.500 --> 01:02:30.000
My draft ready to submit to OLS reduces the amount that's in the bill of 51 41 by 500 so it would bring the price tag down from um 7.5 million to uh under five is that comparable to what the governor was saying in his budget I don't know how much teachers when I increase funding to charters, I couldn't figure out the amount.

805
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.500
I think that brings it down, Mike.

806
01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:35.500
It's close.

807
01:02:35.500 --> 01:02:38.500
It comes out to about $9.4,000.

808
01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:45.000
I think, I can't swear by it, but I thought he said nine.

809
01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:56.000
But that's something that's by slicing it some, we're sending the message that it has to be in line with the governors.

810
01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.500
And that's all we're trying to do today is communicate policy.

811
01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:03.500
policy.

812
01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:20.000
If I may, I think that the goal for these two bills that we're considering is really to get them out of the committee as best, you know, what we feel is appropriate.

813
01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:37.000
But we're really trying to deal with the policy content that then goes to finance, and finance is really the ones that does the final cutting and distributing of the funds within the budget.

814
01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:50.000
So our goal here is what's the policy that we want to go forward to the finance committee so they can do the actual number crunching.

815
01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000
Is that correct, Mr.

816
01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000
Chair?

817
01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.000
I think so.

818
01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:58.000
So, Mr.

819
01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:06.000
Chair, if it's the will of the body, I'll send this down to OLS for drafting.

820
01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:17.500
It's just a simple number change, but it would, I think, put it more in line with what the governor was talking about.

821
01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:22.500
Can you recall, anybody recall what the gov did say?

822
01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.500
What is it?

823
01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:26.500
Was it?

824
01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:33.500
Yeah, in the bill itself, you'll see on I don't have the line number.

825
01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:35.500
Go to two.

826
01:04:35.500 --> 01:04:45.000
Yes, the charter school 272 online six, the 5141 would be changed to 4627, which is roughly Thank you.

827
01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:52.000
On line six, the 5141 would be changed to 4627, which is roughly $500.

828
01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000
Yes.

829
01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000
Why are you making that reduction?

830
01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000
To be in line with the governor's proposal.

831
01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:03.000
The governor...

832
01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000
Okay, that's the rationale for that.

833
01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:08.000
Yes.

834
01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000
Yes.

835
01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000
Excuse me?

836
01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000
Okay, thank you.

837
01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000
That's all.

838
01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:18.000
Thank you.

839
01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000
Representative Lekas.

840
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.000
Representative Lekas.

841
01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000
Who?

842
01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000
The numbers person from the DRE.

843
01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000
Mark is...

844
01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000
Thank you, Representative Kiske.

845
01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:46.000
Just to clarify, so by putting in 4627 for charter public schools, is that going to move that more in line on what we want to do for public schools?

846
01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:48.500
I mean, regular public schools?

847
01:05:48.500 --> 01:05:52.500
Is that what you're suggesting to change for?

848
01:05:52.500 --> 01:06:09.000
The bill which we had before us on the 529 doesn't deal with base adequacy at all or differentiated aid where you would see that base cost the governor proposed at that $4,700.

849
01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:11.000
Yeah, roughly.

850
01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.000
No, I calculated a little higher than that last night.

851
01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000
I got 4,800 plus.

852
01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:32.000
But because I took a flat 25 percent, what he's doing is he's taking basically about 23 or 20 so, and then he's taking that 2 percent growth.

853
01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:34.000
So in there.

854
01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:38.500
So he's calculating it the way it should be.

855
01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:42.000
I was doing just quick, quick math.

856
01:06:42.000 --> 01:07:12.000
So if we were to doing amending today when we're talking about this, I don't know if this bill would be the place to do it or whether we had one bill which dealt with adequacy that, as you recall, was the differentiated aid for special education, where we upped the ante by $20 million with the three weighted categories.

857
01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:24.500
That would be a place where if we wanted to modify base adequacy to reflect what the governor is suggesting, we would do it there.

858
01:07:24.500 --> 01:07:26.500
But we've already executed.

859
01:07:26.500 --> 01:07:29.500
But we've already executed, I'm saying.

860
01:07:29.500 --> 01:07:32.000
And we don't have it.

861
01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000
That's right.

862
01:07:34.000 --> 01:08:01.500
But at the same time, Rick, 540, because it does spell out the special education aid, even if the number were to change from a policy position, we're giving finance a good policy direction that I think is consistent with what the governor said, that he retains a special education factor in the adequacy calculation.

863
01:08:01.500 --> 01:08:03.500
Yes.

864
01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:09.500
And I think there's also other backup information for us conveying that.

865
01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:22.000
And the last two finance study reports, one Republican and one Democrat in those years, there is recommendations in both that the base be increased.

866
01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:59.000
The 2018, yes, it was increased, but margin marginally it doesn't mean we're there representative pattern now um i've really actually been hoping for a flow chart so that us new people to the budget could actually see where these things work could you maybe tell me where 529 fits in exactly on the flow chart because Because if my understanding is correct, it's an additional to the funding formula that we already have.

867
01:08:59.000 --> 01:09:05.500
That's one of the issues which I think we need to discuss here.

868
01:09:05.500 --> 01:09:19.000
And I think the governor did indicate that in this very convoluted formula we have, we have had in this last several years three sets of grants.

869
01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:29.500
We've had physical capacity disparity aid, which if you go back a couple of years, you're going to see it there.

870
01:09:29.500 --> 01:09:34.500
We had relief grant and we have extraordinary needs grant.

871
01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:36.500
One is $17.5 million.

872
01:09:36.500 --> 01:10:11.000
That's the relief relief and the extraordinary needs is 14.2 i believe something such that and drops down to nine point something in the second year there are too many of these such things built upon not the same topic but the same purpose same outcome we're trying to do is help the towns which don't have the revenue to accomplish what they need to do pursuant to adequacy.

873
01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:24.000
Should we be saying that, and I think the governor did say it, where he, in his presentation, he's relying on one of those grants now.

874
01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:41.000
As we boil down the stabilization in his new formula, which is not the amount that we have in stabilization right now, you also beef up every year 50% of the Extraordinary Needs Grant.

875
01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:47.000
And there's no mention of the relief grant or the fiscal capacity.

876
01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:55.000
But the amount of funding that's going to schools is a whole lot more than now.

877
01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:57.000
Yes.

878
01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000
Yeah.

879
01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:21.500
And, you know, from a, you know, size of the apple sort of thing, the $100 million that 529 distributes in each of those years is in the same, you know, park as what the governor said yesterday and the governor presented again this morning.

880
01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:29.000
A very interesting thing, and I think I talked with, and we're being informal, right?

881
01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000
Yes, we are.

882
01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.500
So I talked with Rick and Mel about this during the...

883
01:11:36.500 --> 01:12:08.500
I didn't know you were going to do that well let's keep it I wrap yeah so let's keep it and we're an exec session you know and screaming and talked with um with um well then I'll use this name talked with um uh Bill Ardinger who the the governor mentioned and I texted Bill a picture of the slide from the thing.

884
01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:20.000
And I said, wow, this looks a lot like House Bill 1680, which is something that we offered a couple of years ago.

885
01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.500
Bill texted me right back.

886
01:12:22.500 --> 01:12:27.500
Wow, that does look a lot like House Bill 1680.

887
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:36.000
So Bill served on the School Funding Commission back in 2020 with Representative Ladd, Myler, Kessgaden, myself.

888
01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:41.500
And Bill Ardinger was also the governor's appointment to that commission.

889
01:12:41.500 --> 01:13:01.000
And one of the things that came out of that work was House Bill 1680, which does a lot of what this looks a lot like this, including eliminating the stabilization grants and having a hold harmless in it.

890
01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:12.500
All these things, I think, are probably going to be beyond what we're going to be able to do with 529 this afternoon.

891
01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:47.000
Because House Bill 16, I mean, unlike 529, which is a one-page bill and pretty straightforward, House Bill 1680 is more like a 30-page bill and and gets into a whole lot of um areas that i think are beyond what we're going to be able to do this afternoon but um representative cordelli yeah just um in our presentation over at doe we we had a finance presentation.

892
01:13:47.000 --> 01:14:00.000
On page six of that presentation, there was another flow chart of that that shows the relief aid grant, the extraordinary needs grant, the stabilization grant.

893
01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:03.500
And in 529, there's another new category.

894
01:14:03.500 --> 01:14:14.500
And I think that in a lot of our discussions, we've talked about that those three or four have to be consolidated.

895
01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.500
They're all related.

896
01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.500
I agree.

897
01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:26.500
When the relief grant was put into the current state budget, that's how it was introduced.

898
01:14:26.500 --> 01:14:33.500
Is that a grant that comes out with the end of this fiscal year?

899
01:14:33.500 --> 01:14:39.000
If only I had a law book in front of me.

900
01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:41.500
Well, by 2024, it's out.

901
01:14:41.500 --> 01:14:52.000
In the biennium we're working towards, it would not be in, according to the governor, it wouldn't be in his proposal.

902
01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000
Right, right.

903
01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:58.500
But does it sunset at the end of this?

904
01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.500
I didn't think so.

905
01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:04.500
So that was in there as an ongoing?

906
01:15:04.500 --> 01:15:07.000
It's my impression it's there.

907
01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.000
So just a thought for consideration.

908
01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:30.000
Would some of those things phasing out grants or not phasing out, terminating a grant like the relief grant, do we want to do that in 529 or just leave that to finance as they pull all the numbers together?

909
01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.500
I don't think we have time to do that.

910
01:15:34.500 --> 01:15:41.500
Well, you know, if we don't have time, but I support eliminating a grant.

911
01:15:41.500 --> 01:15:43.500
Yeah.

912
01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.500
It's just too convoluted.

913
01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:47.500
Here's what I found.

914
01:15:47.500 --> 01:15:49.500
That's good you found.

915
01:15:49.500 --> 01:16:00.000
So, no, and I agree, Rick, because I think 529 is directed to the same purposes of those other two grants.

916
01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000
Yes, it is.

917
01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:08.000
So whether you call it 529, extraordinary needs of relief, you know.

918
01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:10.000
Yes.

919
01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:42.000
I mean, it wouldn't be possible, I think, that there's a lot here that on this specific point that we're talking about, that when it gets to finance and we're there to testify to finance that we could make that point that you were just making as far as what needs to be eliminated, etc., from the results of our conversation here on 529.

920
01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:46.000
Can't that be done in front of finance?

921
01:16:46.000 --> 01:16:48.000
Oh, yes, it can.

922
01:16:48.000 --> 01:17:16.000
My only concern is that I don't want to appear that this committee is infatuated with everything within the governor's proposal until we've seen the spreadsheets, until we know that as you're dropping off the stabilization, the amount, this 80 plus that he's talking about a new stabilization, not the 150 million plus we have now.

923
01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:25.500
And so as that drops off, the extraordinary needs grant increases each year by 50% of what you receive.

924
01:17:25.500 --> 01:17:34.500
I want to make sure that the amount that's dropping off and what you receive somewhat parallels you.

925
01:17:34.500 --> 01:17:50.500
From what I understand, talking with people informally right now, there's going to be those districts which are going to still need some kind of a hold harmless to make this work.

926
01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.000
Understand that back in 2010, we didn't have stabilization.

927
01:17:55.000 --> 01:18:06.000
We had hold harmless, and the hold harmless at that point in time was about $27 million total for the entire state.

928
01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:19.000
That's because we had different components within that budgeting process called fiscal capacity disparity aid and how we allocated out dollars based upon free and reduced.

929
01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:31.500
There was larger sums provided the districts which were hurting, like Manchester collected a whole bundle because they would get twice the base adequacy amount.

930
01:18:31.500 --> 01:18:36.500
So we need to see the spreadsheets, what I'm saying.

931
01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:42.500
So, Rick, we do have one spreadsheet that reflects what 529 does.

932
01:18:42.500 --> 01:18:46.500
I want to make sure everybody's got that.

933
01:18:46.500 --> 01:18:54.000
And if you want me to walk through the amendment that I just passed out.

934
01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:59.000
Can you walk through this sheet that you've come out?

935
01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000
Yeah, yeah.

936
01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:09.000
First, should I proceed and send the 272 change down to OLS for a quick draft?

937
01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:11.000
Absolutely.

938
01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:13.000
Okay.

939
01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:15.000
Well, thanks.

940
01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000
Thanks, Len.

941
01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000
Thanks.

942
01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000
And thanks, Representative Cordelia, Representative Vlad.

943
01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:49.000
So the first part of the amendment, titled Amendment Number 1 to 5 529 corrects three technical errors that were in between lines 14 and 22 of the original bill and so um so the first technical correction is um I just want to make sure, would be on line 20 of the bill.

944
01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:54.500
and I'm sorry, would be on line 17 on the bill.

945
01:19:54.500 --> 01:19:58.500
And it replaces the words times the ADMR.

946
01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:01.500
Is everybody on 529, line 17?

947
01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:03.500
All right.

948
01:20:03.500 --> 01:20:18.500
Replaces times the ADMR with per pupil in the municipalities ADMR, and that's taken out of the language that we had the last time we had fiscal capacity disparity aid.

949
01:20:18.500 --> 01:20:24.000
It just makes it very, very clear what municipalities would receive.

950
01:20:24.000 --> 01:20:41.000
The second correction is just a couple lines down where it doesn't have the ADM multiplier in there, so they'd receive, you know, between $2,000 and $0, and that's it, not times the ADMR.

951
01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:53.500
So we added that per pupil in the municipalities ADMR because you receive that number for every student that you have enrolled in that school.

952
01:20:53.500 --> 01:21:01.500
And then the third technical correction is in subparagraph C, where we talk about equalized valuation.

953
01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:16.000
It's equalized valuation per pupil, just like it is in A and B, or equalized valuation per ADMR of $1.6 million, so we'll receive no fiscal capacity disparity aid.

954
01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:22.000
So, obviously, equalized valuation and equalized valuation per ADMR are really different.

955
01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:26.000
And so any questions with the technical corrections?

956
01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.500
Okay, I have some questions regarding just some clarification.

957
01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:35.000
Back in 2018, we had a similar type proposal.

958
01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:38.000
And the proposal used these figures.

959
01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:45.000
And just would you please explain why these figures are no longer used today?

960
01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:47.000
Okay, sure.

961
01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:55.500
Those communities whose equalized valuation is at or below $660,000 would receive an additional $2,500 per student.

962
01:21:55.500 --> 01:22:14.000
And that seems to be a little higher than what we have with the $2,000 would receive an additional $2,500 per student, and that seems to be a little higher than what we have with the $2,000.

963
01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:32.000
The grant amount per pupil would be linearly reduced in relation to equalized property value per pupil to the minimum per pupil grant amount of $1,000 for a committee that has $1,000 in equalized property value.

964
01:22:32.000 --> 01:22:41.000
So we've changed the property valuation that we're having this apply to based upon inflation, I would assume.

965
01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:43.000
That's correct.

966
01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000
Property value.

967
01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.500
Well, there's a couple things I've got.

968
01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:57.000
So I think what you're looking at, Rick, is actually an older version of House Bill 709.

969
01:22:57.000 --> 01:23:00.000
I'm just looking at the recommendations.

970
01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:06.000
These are the recommendations that came out of the 2018 task force.

971
01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:19.500
Yeah, so back in 2018, there actually were municipalities that had equalized valuations in the neighborhood of $350,000 per pupil, equalized valuation per pupil of about $350,000.

972
01:23:19.500 --> 01:23:28.000
Now there's none that I think the lowest is just a little bit below $600,000 per pupil.

973
01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:33.500
So that's why we updated the floor from $350,000 to $600,000.

974
01:23:33.500 --> 01:23:45.000
And we updated the max to 1.6 million, which is just about right at the average equalized value per pupil in the state.

975
01:23:45.000 --> 01:24:04.500
And so 529 is directed for fiscal capacity on a sliding scale, just like like what Representative Ladd said, for districts that have the lowest equalized valuation per pupil of $600,000 will receive $2,000 per pupil in the ADMR.

976
01:24:04.500 --> 01:24:18.000
And that goes all the way down to receiving $0 per pupil in the ADMR when you get to an equalized valuation per pupil of $1.6 million.

977
01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.000
dollars.

978
01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:23.500
So it's a $600,000 to $1.6 million.

979
01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:40.000
So it's a million dollars in valuation on that linear slide, which results in how the 0.0020 cents for each dollar difference, that gets you from 2,000 to zero, over a million chunks.

980
01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:48.500
So forgetting the dollar figures, this is really not a change in policy from what we have.

981
01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.500
Just updated numbers.

982
01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.500
These are updated numbers.

983
01:24:52.500 --> 01:24:55.500
It's not a change in policy.

984
01:24:55.500 --> 01:24:57.500
Representative Dry?

985
01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:59.500
Yeah.

986
01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.500
Yeah.

987
01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:04.000
Yeah, we got that too.

988
01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:06.000
Yeah.

989
01:25:06.000 --> 01:25:08.000
Thank you, Mr.

990
01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000
Chairman.

991
01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:15.500
Representative Luno, this is three pieces of math in B there.

992
01:25:15.500 --> 01:25:21.000
You find the difference between the ADMR and 16, 1,600,000, right?

993
01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:28.500
Then you multiply that by 0.002, and then you multiply per pupil in their ADMR.

994
01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:30.500
That's exactly correct.

995
01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.500
Thank you.

996
01:25:32.500 --> 01:25:35.500
Why don't you go on with.

997
01:25:35.500 --> 01:25:37.500
Okay.

998
01:25:37.500 --> 01:25:43.000
And then the bill adds three new, well, three new sections.

999
01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:47.000
Section, well, section two of the bill remains.

1000
01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:55.000
Section two of the existing bill, I think, defines what equalized valuation per no, no, sorry.

1001
01:25:55.000 --> 01:26:16.000
Section 2 of the bill is the and that remains is making sure that these two grants, the fiscal capacity disparity grant and the free and reduced price lunch grant are calculated as part of the education grant going out to municipalities.

1002
01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:23.500
And so Section 2 modifies 198, colon 41, which is where that grant is calculated.

1003
01:26:23.500 --> 01:26:34.000
And then back to the amendment, new Section 3 is an accountability section that is taken verbatim from Senate Bill 420.

1004
01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:37.000
Did I get the number right?

1005
01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:47.000
The Extraordinary Needs Grant, Senate Bill 420 from last year, which got that language from the 2018 Umberger Study Committee.

1006
01:26:47.000 --> 01:27:04.500
And it just requires the schools receiving that grant to provide a plan on how money was used and then provide also information to the department on how successful the use of that grant was.

1007
01:27:04.500 --> 01:27:18.500
It also adds a floor of $50,000 so that school districts that are receiving very small grants don't have to do more paperwork than the grant is worth.

1008
01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:27.500
And I think we included that at the department's request in the Extraordinary Eads Grant statute this year.

1009
01:27:27.500 --> 01:27:29.500
So that's Section 3.

1010
01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:54.000
Section 4 is language that was provided, and I forget, it was either provided by legislative services or from the Legislative Budget Office on if schools were to receive additional funds from the state that went beyond what they were notified of back in October of the preceding year.

1011
01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:59.000
So obviously school districts have gone through their budget processes.

1012
01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:03.000
Budget committees have gone through their budget processes.

1013
01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:09.000
They all, most of them meet in March and approve their budgets.

1014
01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:15.000
Tax rates don't get set until the fall, the next, this fall.

1015
01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:33.000
But if this were to become law, the Department of Education would then send out a revised notice to all schools saying, you know, schools that fell into these grant categories would be receiving additional money.

1016
01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:40.500
That would obviously factor into either the district's budget or into the district's tax calculation.

1017
01:28:40.500 --> 01:28:52.000
And Section 4 simply allows districts to do that by being able to receive unanticipated funds that flow through the Education Trust Fund.

1018
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:57.500
And then Section 5 says the act begins July 1st, 2023.

1019
01:28:57.500 --> 01:29:02.500
So that's the first day of our upcoming state budget.

1020
01:29:02.500 --> 01:29:08.500
And these provisions would apply to both years of the state budget.

1021
01:29:08.500 --> 01:29:12.000
Questions for the discussion from the committee?

1022
01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:46.500
Now, I did hear the governor suggest that when the state provides grants to fiscal capacity disparity grants to schools that, you know, and he said it in, I think, a very respectful way that it could be used how the districts want to use it, whether that's for tax reduction or to spend on new programs, that it would be up to the school district to do that.

1023
01:29:46.500 --> 01:30:00.000
Section 3, because it's an accountability section, it sounded like the governor would leave it up to us whether Section 3 should be in there or not.

1024
01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:03.500
That's what it sounded like to me.

1025
01:30:03.500 --> 01:30:09.000
Yeah, and this is the rubbing point on part of this.

1026
01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:23.500
Is the money unrestricted, like we do with adequacy and all that, or is it restricted to certain purposes which are defined elsewhere in law or within law here?

1027
01:30:23.500 --> 01:30:29.500
And then if it's unrestricted, then there would be no accountability section.

1028
01:30:29.500 --> 01:30:45.500
Now, getting into political reality right now, that I have the feeling it's going to be very difficult getting anything through finance that does not have an accountability or something written in.

1029
01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:51.000
This accountability, it didn't just date from the 2018 Umburger Report.

1030
01:30:51.000 --> 01:31:01.500
It goes back and comes out of the 2009 report when we had, you know, that we built this formula, basically.

1031
01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:06.500
And what's her name was of the chair, Senator Estabrook.

1032
01:31:06.500 --> 01:31:13.500
And they had an accountability measure in there too at that point in time.

1033
01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:16.000
It's very broad in nature.

1034
01:31:16.000 --> 01:31:27.500
I don't think it necessarily said a report had to be provided, but the money could be used for these type of purposes.

1035
01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:31.500
There's a wide open field of educational purposes.

1036
01:31:31.500 --> 01:31:35.000
So I guess that's where we are.

1037
01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:40.000
Do we want to have accountability in there or not?

1038
01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:42.000
Is it unrestricted?

1039
01:31:42.000 --> 01:31:44.000
Representative Kiskadden?

1040
01:31:44.000 --> 01:32:00.000
Just to add on accountability, I mean, I find if you add an accountability piece, but wouldn't we add the same accountability to the funding for a public charter if they're both?

1041
01:32:00.000 --> 01:32:13.500
I mean, it sounded like we're trying to assimilate a similar funding amount for both groups, and we should treat them all as public school students, correct?

1042
01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:20.500
And wouldn't we have some sort of accountability if we're doing it for one?

1043
01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:24.500
Why aren't we doing it for the other?

1044
01:32:24.500 --> 01:32:30.000
It can be a little different because the charter is different.

1045
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:39.500
And it would be easier if we didn't have a specific amount of items or ways to spend it.

1046
01:32:39.500 --> 01:33:10.500
Because some schools will need that money to replace stabilization fund just to meet minimum standards so it's easier if it's open-ended but if you're going to go accountability for one i don't understand why you wouldn't go accountability for all publics yep let me just say one thing here now everybody understands what part of the funding formula we're dealing with.

1047
01:33:10.500 --> 01:33:16.000
If it's space adequacy and differentiated aid, those are unrestricted dollars.

1048
01:33:16.000 --> 01:33:18.000
You use them, Mr.

1049
01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:22.500
Superintendent and school board, any way you so desire.

1050
01:33:22.500 --> 01:33:51.000
Anything outside of that, though, is called a grant, a categorical type money coming in, which it's not, that is sort of different than Claremont and Londonderry, prescribed that every child gets X number of dollars or the same treatment, regardless of the community you come from, whether it's a property poor or a property wealthy community.

1051
01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:58.500
So I'd have to look at those extra dollars which are received by the charter.

1052
01:33:58.500 --> 01:34:04.000
Is that a grant, or is that part of the formula?

1053
01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:13.000
Is it called a grant, or is it just, say, that's part of their funding allocation per pupil?

1054
01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000
I don't know.

1055
01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:18.000
So, Rick, one of the—or, Mr.

1056
01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:20.000
Chair, sorry.

1057
01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:27.000
One of the—I don't want the—I don't want, yes, Representative Woodcock to— Thank you.

1058
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:32.000
Yeah, so Rick, you know, one of the, or Mr.

1059
01:34:32.000 --> 01:34:41.000
Chair, sorry, one of the, I don't want the Gov, I don't want, yes, Representative Woodcock to, yeah.

1060
01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:55.500
So the Governor did, obviously, shows the Extraordinary Needs Grant in here, in the Phase 3 line on his proposal, and that does have an accountability section in there.

1061
01:34:55.500 --> 01:35:31.000
If this were to essentially replace the Extraordinary Needs Grant, which I think it could do when it got to finance, then you can sort of drop it in the way it is now rather than have to add an accountability section or do anything to, I mean, it really does look a lot like the Extraordinary Needs Grant, you know, with additional dollars behind it, as the governor has suggested.

1062
01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:46.500
So, you know, and I think what Representative Vlad and Myler were also suggesting that getting this over to finance, obviously through the floor, onto the floor, and then to finance.

1063
01:35:46.500 --> 01:35:51.500
These bills, House Bill 529, will never be a standalone.

1064
01:35:51.500 --> 01:35:58.000
It's a standalone bill here, but it gets treated in the budget process.

1065
01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000
It will become HB2.

1066
01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000
It'll be an HB2.

1067
01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:04.000
Something will be HB2.

1068
01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:07.500
And this bill will eventually be ITL'd.

1069
01:36:07.500 --> 01:36:09.500
That's right, exactly.

1070
01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:11.500
This never leaves finance.

1071
01:36:11.500 --> 01:36:15.500
All the bills we send will be ITL'd.

1072
01:36:15.500 --> 01:36:26.000
So the important thing from a policy position isn't so – the important policy position is to get something to finance.

1073
01:36:26.000 --> 01:36:35.500
Then they can do with it, do something with it, because they're not the policy committee, the finance committee.

1074
01:36:35.500 --> 01:37:17.000
And so we're basically saying, and I think it's consistent with what the governor has laid out, that we need to be directing more state dollars to where they're needed most um you know um you know communities with low valuation low property valuations high property tax taxes and uh and less ability to raise the funds that they need to operate a school district in a way that so many other school districts are able to do have access to those resources.

1075
01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000
Representative Cordelli?

1076
01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000
Thank you.

1077
01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:33.000
I think that this process is more in line with what we've all said should happen, in that we will sit down with finance.

1078
01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:38.500
But also, we're establishing policy, and finance will then establish finance.

1079
01:37:38.500 --> 01:37:52.000
And all too often in the past, we've seen finance wanting to dabble in policy as well, which some of us objected to from time to time.

1080
01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:59.000
So I think that this will forestall that type of thing happening this go-round.

1081
01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:11.500
I'd like to add in, too, that this legislation may be directed to, is directed to those towns and communities which really need this support.

1082
01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:20.500
But the governor also presented yesterday and today over $170 million, which would be going to all schools.

1083
01:38:20.500 --> 01:38:27.500
There was $150 million when he added the extra $1,000 on the base adequacy.

1084
01:38:27.500 --> 01:38:30.000
That goes to every student.

1085
01:38:30.000 --> 01:38:36.500
He added in that there would be another $20 million added into F&R.

1086
01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:38.500
That's in differentiated aid.

1087
01:38:38.500 --> 01:38:44.500
That goes to every school that has free and reduced qualifying students.

1088
01:38:44.500 --> 01:38:50.500
We added in another $20 million for weighted formula in special education.

1089
01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:59.000
So what we're doing is we're doing exactly what all the reports have said in the past.

1090
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:16.500
We're directing the resources not just to those that can't make it due to various reasons, but we're also complying with constitutional law, our decisions, the court decisions, that we're directing monies to all students.

1091
01:39:16.500 --> 01:39:23.500
And I think this is, there's a lot of reasoning why this stuff's happening.

1092
01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:33.000
You know, it might be a result of Conval and the other suit we have going on with Mr.

1093
01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000
Volensky.

1094
01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:40.000
But I'd like to look at it further than that.

1095
01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:48.500
I think this is something we all recognize, as Representative Cordelli and Representative Luno have just mentioned.

1096
01:39:48.500 --> 01:39:54.000
It's something that's going to benefit all students in this state.

1097
01:39:54.000 --> 01:40:03.500
And it's going to, we have not changed basically that base adequacy formula ever, other than the CPI adjustment.

1098
01:40:03.500 --> 01:40:09.000
And we know that the cost of all those categories went.

1099
01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:17.000
And this is the difference between what we're doing now and what the commission report was.

1100
01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:22.500
The commission report was built on performance based on the end.

1101
01:40:22.500 --> 01:40:33.500
This is still staying with the inputs that, in base adequacy, here's the expectations that we have to have an adequate education.

1102
01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:46.500
You have to have a teacher, you have to have a specialist or a librarian, you have to this, this, this, maintenance and all that, transportation.

1103
01:40:46.500 --> 01:40:49.500
That's all built in base adequacy.

1104
01:40:49.500 --> 01:41:07.000
And we know that the minimal amount of money being paid for transportation in base adequacy at, what, is it 300 bucks a pupil or something such as that, can't be much more than that.

1105
01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:13.500
Doesn't pay the way for what the actual costs are in the district.

1106
01:41:13.500 --> 01:41:21.000
So we need to address base adequacy as well as what we're doing right here.

1107
01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.000
And that's being done through the governor's budget.

1108
01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000
Representative Cascaden.

1109
01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:44.500
Is there any reaction to the fact that the governor was taking the category out of a dollar amount for students who are reading, you know, who are not proficient at reading at grade three?

1110
01:41:44.500 --> 01:41:46.500
That's just curious.

1111
01:41:46.500 --> 01:41:51.000
That's been a recommendation of every study we've had.

1112
01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000
I know.

1113
01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.500
In the last several years.

1114
01:41:55.500 --> 01:41:59.000
That's only, what, a couple million bucks?

1115
01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.500
It's not a whole lot.

1116
01:42:01.500 --> 01:42:03.500
It's not much.

1117
01:42:03.500 --> 01:42:06.000
I'd rather see the money.

1118
01:42:06.000 --> 01:42:12.500
1.7, and it's an area that I've advocated taking out of the budget.

1119
01:42:12.500 --> 01:42:17.500
I think it's money that's directed in the wrong way.

1120
01:42:17.500 --> 01:42:22.000
There's absolutely no accountability for that one at all.

1121
01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:24.500
Right, and I was curious.

1122
01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:39.500
And so you have the Umberger Report, and the commission that Ripson-Meiler chaired also recommended that same end, that this is one of those areas that needs to go bye-bye.

1123
01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:45.000
And it was a political decision to put it in initially.

1124
01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:49.000
That's how we got some of these bills.

1125
01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:54.500
We agreed to a person that wanted to have poor reading.

1126
01:42:54.500 --> 01:43:01.000
We put it into this bill to get the bill passed years ago.

1127
01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000
Yes, Representative Myler.

1128
01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:13.500
And I think the governor's increases in his proposal areas of increase was taking into account the reduction of that money.

1129
01:43:13.500 --> 01:43:23.000
So that there's additional money, even though you take that out, there's additional money that's going into Phil Vencema.

1130
01:43:23.000 --> 01:43:25.000
Pardon me?

1131
01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:27.000
Net gain.

1132
01:43:27.000 --> 01:43:29.000
Yeah.

1133
01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.500
Yeah, it's a net gain.

1134
01:43:31.500 --> 01:43:33.500
Thank you.

1135
01:43:33.500 --> 01:43:37.500
There's additional money that's going in the field.

1136
01:43:37.500 --> 01:43:39.500
That's not.

1137
01:43:39.500 --> 01:43:41.500
That's not me.

1138
01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:43.500
Yeah.

1139
01:43:43.500 --> 01:43:45.500
Yeah.

1140
01:43:45.500 --> 01:43:47.500
It's in that game.

1141
01:43:47.500 --> 01:43:51.000
Any kind of a gain is helpful.

1142
01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:55.000
Representative Dry, did you have your hand up?

1143
01:43:55.000 --> 01:43:57.000
Yes, I did.

1144
01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.000
Thanks.

1145
01:43:59.000 --> 01:44:10.000
So did we solve the problem of whether accountability would allow us to do, should we turn money in lieu of taxes?

1146
01:44:10.000 --> 01:44:13.000
Can we write that into it?

1147
01:44:13.000 --> 01:44:20.000
I mean, I know this is verbatim from someplace else, but is it editable?

1148
01:44:20.000 --> 01:44:28.000
What we have here is the accountability, the same accountability we have in Extraordinary Needs Grant.

1149
01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:36.000
And we had this discussion, as we recall, if it's less than $50,000, it's unrestricted money.

1150
01:44:36.000 --> 01:44:38.000
Okay.

1151
01:44:38.000 --> 01:44:55.500
If it's more, it's the way things, if this is used for what the governor's proposing and what the governor's proposing becomes law, I'm sure this will be addressed and maybe tweaked or changed somewhat.

1152
01:44:55.500 --> 01:44:59.500
It's not something we have to do today.

1153
01:44:59.500 --> 01:45:01.500
Right.

1154
01:45:01.500 --> 01:45:15.500
I think by keeping the language which we have in Extraordinary Needs Grant right now, which this is, I think it's wise to do that for many reasons.

1155
01:45:15.500 --> 01:45:17.500
Okay.

1156
01:45:17.500 --> 01:45:19.500
Yes, Representative now.

1157
01:45:19.500 --> 01:45:27.500
I still I'm just looking for some clarification to make sure I have this 100% correct.

1158
01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:29.500
So.

1159
01:45:29.500 --> 01:45:35.000
529 with the additional aid grants that fits in right here.

1160
01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:37.000
Am I correct?

1161
01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.000
OK, and.

1162
01:45:39.000 --> 01:45:50.500
with the changes that we think the governor is going to have with the new amount amounts of money, do we need 529?

1163
01:45:50.500 --> 01:45:54.000
Do we need this additional aid grant?

1164
01:45:54.000 --> 01:46:04.500
Okay, I just want to make sure because I try to figure out what, as things go up, what's coming down.

1165
01:46:04.500 --> 01:46:06.500
Yeah.

1166
01:46:06.500 --> 01:46:08.500
Yeah.

1167
01:46:08.500 --> 01:46:14.000
So the Extraordinary Needs Grant is, is, um, yeah, right, right.

1168
01:46:14.000 --> 01:46:16.000
Okay.

1169
01:46:16.000 --> 01:46:18.000
Yeah.

1170
01:46:18.000 --> 01:46:20.000
Necessary.

1171
01:46:20.000 --> 01:46:22.000
Yeah.

1172
01:46:22.000 --> 01:46:24.000
Yeah.

1173
01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:28.000
It sounds like we're all on that page.

1174
01:46:28.000 --> 01:46:30.000
Okay.

1175
01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:35.500
The Extraordinary Needs Grant was introduced by Senator Hennessey last year.

1176
01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.500
Yeah.

1177
01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:39.500
Out of Littleton?

1178
01:46:39.500 --> 01:46:41.500
Representative Damon?

1179
01:46:41.500 --> 01:46:43.500
No.

1180
01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:45.500
Thank you.

1181
01:46:45.500 --> 01:47:03.000
Would it be correct to assume that that ending statement in the new Section 3 of the amendment about you don't have to do the accountability plan if the grant award is less than $50,000.

1182
01:47:03.000 --> 01:47:11.500
Would it be correct to think that there won't be very many that are less than $50,000?

1183
01:47:11.500 --> 01:47:14.500
I think that's to be seen.

1184
01:47:14.500 --> 01:47:17.500
I have not seen a spreadsheet.

1185
01:47:17.500 --> 01:47:19.500
Right.

1186
01:47:19.500 --> 01:47:23.000
That's what we're up against right now.

1187
01:47:23.000 --> 01:47:25.000
There are a lot.

1188
01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:29.500
There are a lot that are less than $50,000?

1189
01:47:29.500 --> 01:48:06.500
And we saw that with yeah yeah we saw that with extraordinary needs grant too is as you taper down to the um getting zero there's a lot of um of districts that are just getting very marginal amounts okay and and there's nothing there's nothing wrong with marginal amounts i mean this is this is definitely based on need uh but but we you know, you don't want the paperwork burden to be.

1190
01:48:06.500 --> 01:48:08.500
Right, right.

1191
01:48:08.500 --> 01:48:11.500
I understand the purpose of it.

1192
01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:15.500
I was just trying to understand the incidents.

1193
01:48:15.500 --> 01:48:26.500
And I think the other thing that the governor mentioned today, there needs to be an effort for consolidation of our districts.

1194
01:48:26.500 --> 01:48:45.500
The issue that we have some school districts are getting so small and we have statutory language saying you will provide this, this, this, and this, and that's why the per pupil costs keep going up so high.

1195
01:48:45.500 --> 01:48:53.500
They have to provide all the aspects of curriculum and instruction that they are required to.

1196
01:48:53.500 --> 01:49:20.000
It's cost prohibitive, but we are now funding that if we could consolidate representative cascada if you could consolidate with uh gorham it'd be a miracle up there well we've been working on it i don't know 45 50 years it hasn't happened yet but i know it there's always in meeting together.

1197
01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000
Yeah.

1198
01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:36.000
And it always seems like the services that are provided are always one-sided because we're always opening our whatever we have to offer, but it's not always reciprocated.

1199
01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:39.000
But, yeah, that's a tough thing.

1200
01:49:39.000 --> 01:49:42.500
But people say, taxpayers say, why not?

1201
01:49:42.500 --> 01:49:44.500
Yeah.

1202
01:49:44.500 --> 01:49:46.500
We'll see.

1203
01:49:46.500 --> 01:49:48.500
That is the key.

1204
01:49:48.500 --> 01:49:55.500
That's where you can get some of the efficiencies if we go into this.

1205
01:49:55.500 --> 01:49:57.500
That's critical.

1206
01:49:57.500 --> 01:50:01.500
That will help us with these funding formulas.

1207
01:50:01.500 --> 01:50:21.500
If you look at the data throughout the country, our administrative costs in the state of New Hampshire are fourth highest in the country because we have so many small districts, which by law have to have that administrative support.

1208
01:50:21.500 --> 01:50:23.500
Representative Damon.

1209
01:50:23.500 --> 01:50:36.000
So just to add support to that, in the nine-town district that I represent, well, one city, eight towns, there are seven different school districts.

1210
01:50:36.000 --> 01:50:38.000
I mean, it's nuts.

1211
01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:43.000
All these little individual towns have their own school district.

1212
01:50:43.000 --> 01:50:45.000
It's not cost effective.

1213
01:50:45.000 --> 01:50:50.000
It seems like we could have some learning from Vermont.

1214
01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:57.500
I mean, they mandated consolidation, have been working on that for the last five years.

1215
01:50:57.500 --> 01:51:01.000
I have mixed results on that, though.

1216
01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000
There are mixed results.

1217
01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000
Yes.

1218
01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:24.500
If you were to talk to the fellow who was superintendent of the year here back a little bit and went over and worked in Orange County in Vermont, he said the administrative costs are going the other direction.

1219
01:51:24.500 --> 01:51:26.500
That's costing more.

1220
01:51:26.500 --> 01:51:51.500
If you look at consolidation over in the state of Maine when they went after consolidation, one school district consolidated, and that was Rumford, Mexico, right on either side of the Anderskoggin River, and they should have been one all along, seeing the population of the town has gone down.

1221
01:51:51.500 --> 01:52:33.500
Rumford used to have the highest per capita income in the state of Maine when the old Oxford Paper Company was there, and Bo boise cascade now now it's it's a ghost town basically and and they did consolidate only one state and one town consolidated so consolidation is a tough thing it's almost like you got it i don't know what you got to mandate it or get up there and beat them over the head, but they don't want to do it.

1222
01:52:33.500 --> 01:52:35.500
It's all local control.

1223
01:52:35.500 --> 01:52:37.500
Mr.

1224
01:52:37.500 --> 01:52:50.000
Chair, it seems like there are some interesting ramifications for the amount of school districts we now want to remove themselves from cooperative school districts.

1225
01:52:50.000 --> 01:52:56.500
I was just talking to the New Hampshire School Boards Association about that.

1226
01:52:56.500 --> 01:53:02.500
How many have grown since the short time we've been here, Barrett?

1227
01:53:02.500 --> 01:53:04.500
Sure, come on up.

1228
01:53:04.500 --> 01:53:10.500
Well, he gave a number today, which was pretty amazing to me.

1229
01:53:10.500 --> 01:53:17.000
Thank you, Chairman Ladd, members of the Committee Bear Christina School Boards Association.

1230
01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:23.000
Let's not mistake cooperative school districts for school administrative units, the SAUs.

1231
01:53:23.000 --> 01:53:26.000
I started at NHSBA in 2005.

1232
01:53:26.000 --> 01:53:32.000
There were, I believe, 84 SAUs at the time, your central offices.

1233
01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:37.500
We're up to, I think, 106 now, so one more year.

1234
01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:40.500
So that is a new superintendent.

1235
01:53:40.500 --> 01:54:00.000
Some of those are part-time superintendents that will cover a couple different small districts, but that's still more services by law that that SAU has to provide your special ed services, your central office, your business manager, your superintendent.

1236
01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:06.000
And the whole issue with the co-ops is a whole other issue.

1237
01:54:06.000 --> 01:54:08.000
Sure.

1238
01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:19.500
So when I started in 2005, I believe there were 84, perhaps 85 SAUs, and now we're up to, I believe, it's 106.

1239
01:54:19.500 --> 01:54:24.000
So 20 more than we had 17 years ago.

1240
01:54:24.000 --> 01:54:26.000
Yes, Representative Cornell.

1241
01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:28.500
Garrett, how do they increase?

1242
01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:32.500
So the SAU withdrawal process is very simple.

1243
01:54:32.500 --> 01:54:43.500
If we have three towns and a multi-district SAU, all you have to do is you create a study committee per statute.

1244
01:54:43.500 --> 01:54:46.500
There's statutory language to do that.

1245
01:54:46.500 --> 01:54:49.500
The issue goes on the warrant.

1246
01:54:49.500 --> 01:54:53.500
It's voted on to initiate the withdrawal study.

1247
01:54:53.500 --> 01:55:07.000
You have to go through six months of studying and the numbers and how you're going to provide the services, the special ed and the business services.

1248
01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:20.000
I believe the Department of Education, I'm sorry, the State Board reviews it without, they don't decide whether it's a good idea or a bad idea.

1249
01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:38.500
They just make sure that all the boxes have been checked, that the statute requires be within the SAU withdrawal plan, and then it goes to the voters only within the town that is looking to withdraw.

1250
01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:41.000
It doesn't go out SAU-wide.

1251
01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:53.000
So that town controls its ability of whether or not that school district controls its ability of whether or not they want to withdraw.

1252
01:55:53.000 --> 01:56:19.500
My experience, when I, so again, going back almost 17, 18 years now, I noticed that it was often the property rich town that was initially deciding to leave and withdraw, figuring we don't, we don't, we have the money, we don't need to share the administrative costs with the other neighboring districts.

1253
01:56:19.500 --> 01:57:16.000
I've also seen sort of the inverse happening now, where it's perhaps the smaller property poor district, when I say now maybe the last 10 years, the smaller property poor district that is withdrawing, saying we're paying perhaps a third of the sau office budget but we're only getting maybe 20 of the services so we'll bear we'll eat the cost but we know it's our superintendent answerable to us our business manager answerable to us we're not sharing services and that's a that's a cost that's a local that's a local decision if they if it costs more but they're getting full services, that's the prerogative of the voters in that community.

1254
01:57:16.000 --> 01:57:18.000
Yep.

1255
01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.000
Thank you.

1256
01:57:20.000 --> 01:57:22.000
Thank you very much.

1257
01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:26.000
So we've gone through the possible amendment here.

1258
01:57:26.000 --> 01:57:28.500
This is amendment number one.

1259
01:57:28.500 --> 01:58:04.500
Was there a three or four um i i have a another version of of this without the accountability section okay um that uh i i don't know if we really need to talk about that and um and that's all i have okay okay and we've already exact 540 which i think sends over a good policy change in the adequacy thing, and I just received the amendments back from OLS.

1260
01:58:04.500 --> 01:58:06.500
Okay.

1261
01:58:06.500 --> 01:58:09.500
I'm just reviewing it right now.

1262
01:58:09.500 --> 01:58:11.500
Okay, good.

1263
01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:14.500
And I'll make copies of here.

1264
01:58:14.500 --> 01:58:16.500
Mine's upstairs and copy.

1265
01:58:16.500 --> 01:58:18.500
Okay, great, great.

1266
01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:27.000
Okay, so what we're going to do is, if there's any more discussion, we can have that.

1267
01:58:27.000 --> 01:58:34.500
If not, let's just take a short break until we get those amendments down here.

1268
01:58:34.500 --> 01:58:36.500
Thank you.

1269
01:58:36.500 --> 01:58:38.500
Thank you.

1270
01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:40.500
Thank you.

1271
01:58:40.500 --> 01:58:42.500
Thank you.

1272
01:58:42.500 --> 01:58:44.500
Thank you.

1273
01:58:44.500 --> 01:58:46.500
Thank you.

1274
01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:48.500
Thank you.

1275
01:58:48.500 --> 01:58:50.500
Thank you.

1276
01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:52.500
Thank you.

1277
01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:54.500
Thank you.

1278
01:58:54.500 --> 01:58:56.500
Thank you.

1279
01:58:56.500 --> 01:58:58.500
Thank you.

1280
01:58:58.500 --> 01:59:00.500
Thank you.

1281
01:59:00.500 --> 01:59:02.500
Thank you.

1282
01:59:02.500 --> 01:59:04.500
Thank you.

1283
01:59:04.500 --> 01:59:06.500
Thank you.

1284
01:59:06.500 --> 01:59:31.500
We should all have several amendments in front of us so on 272 you need to have the amendment 0223 and on 520 need you need amendment that's 0544 so looks like we're all good that way By the way, somebody just asked, how do you keep your memory there?

1285
01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:38.000
I'll tell you the key is a tablespoon of maple syrup every morning.

1286
01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:44.000
Well, yeah, there was a study done that in Vermont, of course.

1287
01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000
Pardon me?

1288
01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000
And take vitamin B.

1289
01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:50.000
Okay.

1290
01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:59.000
So we're going to take up 529 first, and I look to Representative Luna for a motion, please.

Representative Cornell.

1478
02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:49.500
Yes.

1479
02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:51.500
Representative Lane.

1480
02:08:51.500 --> 02:08:53.500
Yes.

1481
02:08:53.500 --> 02:08:55.500
Representative Luna.

1482
02:08:55.500 --> 02:08:57.500
Yes.

1483
02:08:57.500 --> 02:08:59.500
Representative Ellison.

1484
02:08:59.500 --> 02:09:01.500
Yes.

1485
02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.500
Representative Woodcock.

1486
02:09:03.500 --> 02:09:05.500
No.

1487
02:09:05.500 --> 02:09:07.500
Representative Hall.

1488
02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:09.500
Yes.

1489
02:09:09.500 --> 02:09:11.500
Representative Balboni.

1490
02:09:11.500 --> 02:09:13.500
Yes.

1491
02:09:13.500 --> 02:09:15.500
Representative Cass Gabbin.

1492
02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:17.500
No.

1493
02:09:17.500 --> 02:09:19.500
Representative Damon.

1494
02:09:19.500 --> 02:09:21.500
Yes.

1495
02:09:21.500 --> 02:09:23.500
Chairmani.

1496
02:09:23.500 --> 02:09:25.500
Yes.

1497
02:09:25.500 --> 02:09:27.500
Representative Cass Gavin.

1498
02:09:27.500 --> 02:09:29.500
No.

1499
02:09:29.500 --> 02:09:31.500
Representative Damon.

1500
02:09:31.500 --> 02:09:33.500
Yes.

1501
02:09:33.500 --> 02:09:35.500
Chairman that yes.

1502
02:09:35.500 --> 02:09:37.500
18 years to nays.

1503
02:09:37.500 --> 02:09:39.500
Thank you.

1504
02:09:39.500 --> 02:09:41.500
Right.

1505
02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:43.500
Yes, you're recognized.

1506
02:09:43.500 --> 02:09:45.500
Thank you, Mr Chairman.

1507
02:09:45.500 --> 02:09:52.500
I would would like to move, ought to pass as amended with Amendment 0223H.

1508
02:09:52.500 --> 02:09:54.500
Is there a second?

1509
02:09:54.500 --> 02:09:56.500
Second.

1510
02:09:56.500 --> 02:09:58.500
Thank you, Representative McDonald.

1511
02:09:58.500 --> 02:10:00.500
Further discussion, Representative Cordelli?

1512
02:10:00.500 --> 02:10:02.500
None.

1513
02:10:02.500 --> 02:10:04.500
Representative McDonald?

1514
02:10:04.500 --> 02:10:06.500
None.

1515
02:10:06.500 --> 02:10:09.500
Communication with the, yes, Representative Myler.

1516
02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:11.500
Yes.

1517
02:10:11.500 --> 02:10:18.000
I plan to vote on this, and I want to make a statement.

1518
02:10:18.000 --> 02:10:25.500
This is really the first time that I voted for an increase to charter schools.

1519
02:10:25.500 --> 02:10:34.500
And the reason why I'm doing this is because I've watched the charter schools develop over the years.

1520
02:10:34.500 --> 02:10:39.500
I'm still very concerned about the oversight of charter schools.

1521
02:10:39.500 --> 02:10:46.000
I think there are some major issues that still need to be addressed.

1522
02:10:46.000 --> 02:10:57.500
We've had concerns that have been exhibited on a regular basis before the State Board of Education regarding governance of the charter schools.

1523
02:10:57.500 --> 02:10:59.500
I'm concerned about that.

1524
02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:24.500
Although even with those questions, I've come to the conclusion that at least at this point in time, particularly as I look at the surplus that's in the education trust fund, because I've always been concerned about funding going to public schools directly, even though that charters are public schools.

1525
02:11:24.500 --> 02:11:36.000
And so this is, for me, is a major change in my vote on this particular issue, and I plan to vote yes.

1526
02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:38.000
Further discussion, Representative Cordelli?

1527
02:11:38.000 --> 02:11:54.000
Yes, I just want to follow up on that in that I had checked with Tal Baer from the Department of Education in relation to charter schools on the number of closures.

1528
02:11:54.000 --> 02:12:05.000
And since 2005, there have been nine closures, and all are the result of enrollment and subsequent financial challenges, per his email.

1529
02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:07.000
Further discussion?

1530
02:12:07.000 --> 02:12:09.000
Representative Kiskadden?

1531
02:12:09.000 --> 02:12:16.500
I support the work that the charters are doing because I've seen some successful ones.

1532
02:12:16.500 --> 02:12:21.000
I think they deserve the increase in the funding.

1533
02:12:21.000 --> 02:12:24.000
Again, my concern is the accountability.

1534
02:12:24.000 --> 02:12:26.500
That's what I struggle with.

1535
02:12:26.500 --> 02:12:28.500
What's the achievement progress?

1536
02:12:28.500 --> 02:12:30.500
What's the graduation rate?

1537
02:12:30.500 --> 02:12:35.500
I haven't been able to find any of that data.

1538
02:12:35.500 --> 02:12:49.000
And from what I could see, there is a template of a plan that they have to fill out for the Department of Ed based on objectives.

1539
02:12:49.000 --> 02:12:59.000
But it definitely doesn't rise to the level of the public school data reports, and it doesn't necessarily have to.

1540
02:12:59.000 --> 02:13:09.500
But there should be some caveat of an accountability that would help reinforce the public's trust in a charter school even.

1541
02:13:09.500 --> 02:13:11.500
Thank you.

1542
02:13:11.500 --> 02:13:17.000
And I'd like to just dovetail on that a little bit.

1543
02:13:17.000 --> 02:13:23.000
Representative Cascadden, you and I have a charter school up in Littleton.

1544
02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:34.000
That's an exceptional organization and works very cooperatively with the superintendents in those school districts in which kids come to it from.

1545
02:13:34.000 --> 02:13:47.500
And I think we have some models out there that are very, very successful, and working with students which are really benefiting from being in that environment.

1546
02:13:47.500 --> 02:13:59.500
In fact, the district item has seats allocated to it for that charter school, as I'm sure that you do over there to Berlin.

1547
02:13:59.500 --> 02:14:22.500
And so there are some really, really exceptional charter schools out there that are doing this, and I feel there really is a place for them, and this will help them even succeed and do some things we may be asking them to be accountable for.

1548
02:14:22.500 --> 02:14:24.500
Thank you.

1549
02:14:24.500 --> 02:14:26.500
Yes, Representative Luno.

1550
02:14:26.500 --> 02:14:29.500
Yeah, thank you very much, Mr.

1551
02:14:29.500 --> 02:15:07.000
Chair, and I'm not trying to take away your last word on this so so but but I wanted to also indicate as did Representative Myler this will be the first time that I'm supporting an increased grant to charter schools and and I think it's it's really for two there's two reasons why I'm supporting this one of them is is I think it's fair they haven't had an increase to their Thank you.

1552
02:15:07.000 --> 02:15:13.000
And I think it's really for two reasons why I'm supporting this.

1553
02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:17.000
One of them is I think it's fair.

1554
02:15:17.000 --> 02:15:35.000
They haven't had an increase to their grant in five years, and we've certainly seen a lot happen over the last five years in terms of increased costs, whether that's staffing, whether it's materials or rent.

1555
02:15:35.000 --> 02:16:14.000
And I think it's fair uh number two is um is i would like to see uh charter schools have more oversight and and accountability but it's hard to ask for accountability when you're not funding them in a fair way that allows them to be accountable to do a to do a a good job with with uh with strong outcomes and i'm not saying that that charter schools don't do a good job with strong outcomes.

1556
02:16:14.000 --> 02:16:24.500
And I'm not saying that charter schools don't do a good job and don't have strong outcomes, because many clearly do.

1557
02:16:24.500 --> 02:16:33.500
But when you're not funding them, when you're having them gasp for air, same with public school districts.

1558
02:16:33.500 --> 02:16:39.000
When they're gasping for air, it's hard to hold them accountable.

1559
02:16:39.000 --> 02:16:56.500
so I think as we've done in 529 and as we're hoping to do with charters, to be able to hold them accountable, I think we've got to start with making sure that we're accountable.

1560
02:16:56.500 --> 02:16:58.500
Thank you.

1561
02:16:58.500 --> 02:17:00.500
Representative Pettner.

1562
02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:02.500
Thank you.

1563
02:17:02.500 --> 02:17:16.500
I would just like to comment on the accountability and say that if the greatest measure of accountability is that the parents continue to send their children there.

1564
02:17:16.500 --> 02:17:27.500
And if the parents didn't think their children were getting good results, then they would put them back in the public schools.

1565
02:17:27.500 --> 02:17:29.500
Representative Cascadden.

1566
02:17:29.500 --> 02:17:45.500
I was just thinking of a simple thing that would work as accountability is, you know, how many students in each charter school is reading at grade level, say by third grade?

1567
02:17:45.500 --> 02:17:59.000
I mean, they should, even if it's a K to four, K to five, shouldn't they be able to produce that no matter what tool they use?

1568
02:17:59.000 --> 02:18:07.000
And if they have a high school component, how many kids do they graduate every year?

1569
02:18:07.000 --> 02:18:10.500
Those are simple data points, aren't they?

1570
02:18:10.500 --> 02:18:13.500
I mean, what do you think?

1571
02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:49.000
I think that my response to that is that I think we can get the data points on the graduation in terms of some charter schools are built around students maybe have IEPs, and I would kind of be cautious in stating that, because even for those that have IEPs in the regular public schools, when it comes to the statewide assessment, we accommodate them in that with an alternative assessment.

1572
02:18:49.000 --> 02:18:56.500
Or in some, they don't even take it because it's just written in the IEP.

1573
02:18:56.500 --> 02:19:01.000
And they may even have a full year program.

1574
02:19:01.000 --> 02:19:06.500
They may have a program going through the summertime as well.

1575
02:19:06.500 --> 02:19:09.500
So there are some extenuating circumstances.

1576
02:19:09.500 --> 02:19:16.500
I believe that the charter schools all do have accountability through the statewide assessment.

1577
02:19:16.500 --> 02:19:18.500
They take that assessment.

1578
02:19:18.500 --> 02:19:24.500
And so that assessment score is the same one that comes out.

1579
02:19:24.500 --> 02:19:33.000
So we can get a hold of that information, and that's easy for us to look at.

1580
02:19:33.000 --> 02:19:52.500
And if we see something like we've been seeing with the underperformance in mathematics throughout the state with students from every walk of life just about, then we've got to step in and say, okay, how can we help?

1581
02:19:52.500 --> 02:19:55.500
How can we help professional training?

1582
02:19:55.500 --> 02:20:42.000
how can we help how can we help professional training how can we help through higher education helping the teachers how can we help families because we're going through so many unique situations in our society today that many kids walk home and there is nobody home and and so you know rather rather than doing that reading that they should be doing or hearing somebody read to them, like I was reading just the other night for my youngster in the house, Blueberries for Sal by McCluskey, they don't get that opportunity.

1583
02:20:42.000 --> 02:20:48.000
And so they'd rather Xbox it, even if they have the Xbox.

1584
02:20:48.000 --> 02:20:58.500
So I think we got to be cautious, but they do take the statewide assessment so we can get the information.

1585
02:20:58.500 --> 02:21:00.500
Yes.

1586
02:21:00.500 --> 02:21:29.500
So do you think it would, to me, I mean, these are public schools, and I think part of our messaging when we develop this is to get public support to see, see here's another opportunity for kids, and maybe some type of line in there that says they're accountable through the New Hampshire state assessment system, period.

1587
02:21:29.500 --> 02:21:31.500
Well, they are accountable.

1588
02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:35.500
Right, but the public may not know that.

1589
02:21:35.500 --> 02:21:37.500
I didn't know that.

1590
02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:39.500
Yeah.

1591
02:21:39.500 --> 02:21:50.000
So maybe we just have to work with DOE to making that, you know, knowledgeable rather than doing it through legislation.

1592
02:21:50.000 --> 02:21:57.500
We make so much legislation, so many rules that it's like the government was saying.

1593
02:21:57.500 --> 02:21:59.500
I agree with you.

1594
02:21:59.500 --> 02:22:01.500
Yeah.

1595
02:22:01.500 --> 02:22:03.500
Thank you.

1596
02:22:03.500 --> 02:22:05.500
Representative Damon.

1597
02:22:05.500 --> 02:22:07.500
Thank you.

1598
02:22:07.500 --> 02:22:11.500
And I love the blueberries for Sal book.

1599
02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:14.500
I just have to say that.

1600
02:22:14.500 --> 02:22:24.000
So I agree that it's appropriate for charter schools to have more funding after five years without any change.

1601
02:22:24.000 --> 02:22:29.000
But I significantly share the concerns about accountability and oversight.

1602
02:22:29.000 --> 02:22:41.500
When charter schools were enacted into law in 1996, so quite a while ago, the Joint Legislative Oversight Committee was established in that original law.

1603
02:22:41.500 --> 02:22:52.000
Representative Tanner left me a chart of the file on the meetings of the Legislative Oversight Committee going back to 1996.

1604
02:22:52.000 --> 02:23:01.000
In 2011, there were five meetings, and there was a report that came out of that oversight committee.

1605
02:23:01.000 --> 02:23:04.000
In 2012, there were two meetings.

1606
02:23:04.000 --> 02:23:14.500
There was one meeting per year in each year from 2013 to 2016, and there have been no meetings since then.

1607
02:23:14.500 --> 02:23:18.000
There has been no reports since 2011.

1608
02:23:18.000 --> 02:23:40.500
So perhaps the chairs thought that we need to get action on what already exists in law is the right way to go, but it seems very concerning to me that we have an oversight committee that essentially does nothing and we hear nothing from.

1609
02:23:40.500 --> 02:23:42.500
Representative Lekas.

1610
02:23:42.500 --> 02:24:19.000
My understanding, and please correct me if I'm wrong wrong but the portal that we know about the do portal and it's on public schools aren't the charter schools in there and don't we have all this data right at our fingertips so anybody who wants to know any of that stuff isn't that there or am i mistaken it's there it's there represent woodcock thank you chairman and i'm Thank you, Chairman.

1611
02:24:19.000 --> 02:24:24.000
And I'm sure I hope you get the last word.

1612
02:24:24.000 --> 02:24:34.000
I appreciate the interest in increased funding charter schools, particularly because Conway has two legitimate school choice options for parents.

1613
02:24:34.000 --> 02:24:48.500
They have the charter school, obviously our newest one that focuses on outdoor ed philosophy, and as well as the Robert Frost has been there for a long time.

1614
02:24:48.500 --> 02:24:51.000
So I do appreciate that.

1615
02:24:51.000 --> 02:25:02.000
And down in Glenn's area, there's a new one coming in with a $1.1 million construction loan at the new historic site.

1616
02:25:02.000 --> 02:25:16.500
So the child schools are vibrant in Carroll County, and I do appreciate the fact that they give public school parents an opportunity to choose a legitimate public school.

1617
02:25:16.500 --> 02:25:18.500
Thank you.

1618
02:25:18.500 --> 02:25:20.500
Thank you.

1619
02:25:20.500 --> 02:25:22.500
Further discussion?

1620
02:25:22.500 --> 02:25:24.500
Representative Paul?

1621
02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:26.500
Thank you.

1622
02:25:26.500 --> 02:25:31.500
I just wanted to make sure I heard this right.

1623
02:25:31.500 --> 02:25:44.500
Did I hear that parents, Representative Paternell, parents have the ultimate say on whether a school or any kind of schooling, I should say, is accountable?

1624
02:25:44.500 --> 02:25:51.000
If the parents say it is, then that's the end of the game?

1625
02:25:51.000 --> 02:25:59.000
They do send their own children to the public schools and put them to any school.

1626
02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:04.500
Parents trust whoever they're sending their children to to be educated.

1627
02:26:04.500 --> 02:26:13.500
So especially with a charter school, they have the option to take their students, their children out, right?

1628
02:26:13.500 --> 02:27:14.000
Because they're voluntarily seeking a school outside of the public school system so if the if they aren't happy with the charter school they could easily just take their children out of the charter school and put them back in the public school so yes i would say ultimately the parents would decide whether or not the school was successful because if it wasn't suiting the needs or the students weren't meeting adequate educational improvement parents would just take them right back out in either homeschool or put them in a public school or send them somewhere else so yeah by parents having the choice they're deciding what's working best for their own children I don't agree with that at all.

1629
02:27:14.000 --> 02:27:24.000
Well, the bottom line is that there is accountability information available on the portal through a statewide assessment that's available.

1630
02:27:24.000 --> 02:27:29.000
I think that this bill is dealing with the financing.

1631
02:27:29.000 --> 02:27:35.000
It's not talking about all the procedures and processes associated with charter.

1632
02:27:35.000 --> 02:27:40.000
I think we've really escaped and gone beyond the boundaries.

1633
02:27:40.000 --> 02:27:51.500
And I was hoping we could keep this right on task here and look at this particular topic as we did on 5.29.

1634
02:27:51.500 --> 02:27:53.500
Representative Ellison.

1635
02:27:53.500 --> 02:27:58.500
I hope I can meet those parameters with this question.

1636
02:27:58.500 --> 02:28:00.500
Thank you.

1637
02:28:00.500 --> 02:28:05.000
I, too, am going to vote for the bill.

1638
02:28:05.000 --> 02:28:10.000
So I appreciate the rationale that's been offered for that.

1639
02:28:10.000 --> 02:28:14.500
I, too, am sort of concerned about the accountability.

1640
02:28:14.500 --> 02:28:27.500
The one thing on the accountability that seems to me to be unacceptable is the fact that the oversight committee has not met for five years.

1641
02:28:27.500 --> 02:28:38.000
There seems to be a complete lack of interest on this committee about the fact that that committee has not met.

1642
02:28:38.000 --> 02:28:44.000
And I think that's not a good way to run state government.

1643
02:28:44.000 --> 02:28:46.000
Thank you.

1644
02:28:46.000 --> 02:28:53.500
I'd like to just take a second and talk about some of these oversight committees.

1645
02:28:53.500 --> 02:28:58.000
There's a number of them that have worked well.

1646
02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:11.500
And I know that like the oversight committee on improvement and assessment, we had one meeting earlier this year, and the second one will probably be occurring.

1647
02:29:11.500 --> 02:29:28.500
I haven't set it up in the docket yet, but it would probably be somewhere on the time we may have off, because there's no other time in which you have to have this.

1648
02:29:28.500 --> 02:29:34.000
And I don't I've not ever sat on this oversight committee.

1649
02:29:34.000 --> 02:29:54.000
But I know that I know that it needs to act in accordance with statutory law, which says, you know, you should have a report to the, you know, the Senate, the House, the State Library, et cetera, et cetera.

1650
02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:17.000
So if there's evidence that it has been functioning, we need to get it going and need to get that oversight because we do have oversight in some of the other areas which we're looking at, and I think that's going to be very, very important.

1651
02:30:17.000 --> 02:30:28.000
In fact, one of the things on the next oversight meeting will be standards that we've oftentimes talked about, and we're watching.

1652
02:30:28.000 --> 02:30:30.000
So any further discussion?

1653
02:30:30.000 --> 02:30:32.000
Pardon me?

1654
02:30:32.000 --> 02:30:34.000
Patty's not watching.

1655
02:30:34.000 --> 02:30:36.500
You've run out of time?

1656
02:30:36.500 --> 02:30:38.500
Yeah.

1657
02:30:38.500 --> 02:30:43.000
I'll Follow up in your comment, if I may.

1658
02:30:43.000 --> 02:30:48.000
Who is the chair of the Charter School Oversight Committee?

1659
02:30:48.000 --> 02:30:53.000
See, one of the problems is I can't answer directly.

1660
02:30:53.000 --> 02:30:55.000
Maybe Representative Cordelli can.

1661
02:30:55.000 --> 02:31:02.000
I know that I thought Representative Shah was on it when she was here.

1662
02:31:02.000 --> 02:31:14.000
The nature of the beast here is that every two years we have elections, and then those people that were on it are gone.

1663
02:31:14.000 --> 02:31:16.000
Okay.

1664
02:31:16.000 --> 02:31:18.000
Or choose.

1665
02:31:18.000 --> 02:31:22.000
I don't want to be back on that.

1666
02:31:22.000 --> 02:31:26.000
And I've been on several things down here.

1667
02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:29.000
I couldn't wait to get off.

1668
02:31:29.000 --> 02:31:31.000
Gelcar was one.

1669
02:31:31.000 --> 02:31:35.000
I was on the Special Education Advisory Council.

1670
02:31:35.000 --> 02:31:37.500
I couldn't attend that either.

1671
02:31:37.500 --> 02:31:46.500
So what I wanted to be on again, but I saw Representative Cornell, you've done an excellent job.

1672
02:31:46.500 --> 02:31:51.000
That's a real good one that they meet often.

1673
02:31:51.000 --> 02:32:07.000
And so it's, I think a lot of it's because people do leave, and then some of them, for example, higher education, it switches between leadership in the Senate, leadership in here.

1674
02:32:07.000 --> 02:32:09.500
I understand that, Reverend Lamar.

1675
02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:14.500
I'm just trying to find out who is in charge.

1676
02:32:14.500 --> 02:32:42.000
I, if it, for example, if it's set up by the Senate, a Senate bill, the Senate has responsibility for putting their senators on it, but the senators then are the ones that are responsible for making the motion for, okay, who's going to be chair of this thing unless it's stipulated in that bill.

1677
02:32:42.000 --> 02:32:49.000
I'm still waiting for people from the Senate to be appointed to legislative oversight.

1678
02:32:49.000 --> 02:32:54.000
Okay, but going back to this committee, who's in charge?

1679
02:32:54.000 --> 02:32:56.000
I don't know.

1680
02:32:56.000 --> 02:33:00.000
How do we find that out, Reverend Roy?

1681
02:33:00.000 --> 02:33:02.500
Check with the Speaker's office.

1682
02:33:02.500 --> 02:33:05.500
You will check with Deputy Childs?

1683
02:33:05.500 --> 02:33:15.500
Glenn, in all due respect, I sent the Speaker several emails, to which I never had a response on any.

1684
02:33:15.500 --> 02:33:18.500
So let's not know that one.

1685
02:33:18.500 --> 02:33:22.500
I will check with Deputy Childs about that.

1686
02:33:22.500 --> 02:33:24.500
Appreciate it.

1687
02:33:24.500 --> 02:33:26.500
Thank you, sir.

1688
02:33:26.500 --> 02:33:38.000
Chief of Staff is one that's ultimately their responsible speaker, but they delegate that to the Chief of Staff, Deputy Chief of Staff.

1689
02:33:38.000 --> 02:33:40.000
Thank you, sir.

1690
02:33:40.000 --> 02:33:42.500
Okay, we're back to 272.

1691
02:33:42.500 --> 02:33:46.500
And is it ought to pass as amended?

1692
02:33:46.500 --> 02:33:49.000
So we're at that motion.

1693
02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:51.500
Is there any further discussion?

1694
02:33:51.500 --> 02:33:55.500
Madam Clerk, would you please call the roll?

1695
02:33:55.500 --> 02:33:57.500
Vice Chairman Cordelli.

1696
02:33:57.500 --> 02:33:59.500
Yes.

1697
02:33:59.500 --> 02:34:01.500
Representative Lekas.

1698
02:34:01.500 --> 02:34:03.500
Yes.

1699
02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:05.500
Representative Ford.

1700
02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:07.500
Yes.

1701
02:34:07.500 --> 02:34:09.500
Representative Belcher.

1702
02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:11.500
Yes.

1703
02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:13.500
Representative Dry.

1704
02:34:13.500 --> 02:34:15.500
Yes.

1705
02:34:15.500 --> 02:34:17.500
Representative McDonnell.

1706
02:34:17.500 --> 02:34:19.500
Yes.

1707
02:34:19.500 --> 02:34:21.500
Representative Noble.

1708
02:34:21.500 --> 02:34:23.500
Yes.

1709
02:34:23.500 --> 02:34:25.500
Representative Petternell.

1710
02:34:25.500 --> 02:34:27.500
Yes.

1711
02:34:27.500 --> 02:34:29.500
Representative Corotiello.

1712
02:34:29.500 --> 02:34:31.500
Yes.

1713
02:34:31.500 --> 02:34:33.500
Representative Myler.

1714
02:34:33.500 --> 02:34:35.500
Yes.

1715
02:34:35.500 --> 02:34:37.500
Representative Cornell.

1716
02:34:37.500 --> 02:34:39.500
Yes.

1717
02:34:39.500 --> 02:34:41.500
Representative Lane.

1718
02:34:41.500 --> 02:34:43.500
Yes.

1719
02:34:43.500 --> 02:34:45.500
Representative Luno.

1720
02:34:45.500 --> 02:34:47.500
Yes.

1721
02:34:47.500 --> 02:34:49.500
Representative Ellison.

1722
02:34:49.500 --> 02:34:51.500
Yes.

1723
02:34:51.500 --> 02:34:53.500
Representative Woodcoff.

1724
02:34:53.500 --> 02:34:55.500
Yes.

1725
02:34:55.500 --> 02:34:57.500
Representative Hall.

1726
02:34:57.500 --> 02:34:59.500
Yes.

1727
02:34:59.500 --> 02:35:01.500
Representative Balboni.

1728
02:35:01.500 --> 02:35:03.500
Yes.

1729
02:35:03.500 --> 02:35:05.500
Representative Cascadon.

1730
02:35:05.500 --> 02:35:07.500
Yes.

1731
02:35:07.500 --> 02:35:09.500
Representative Damon.

1732
02:35:09.500 --> 02:35:11.500
No.

1733
02:35:11.500 --> 02:35:13.500
Chairman Lidd.

1734
02:35:13.500 --> 02:35:15.500
Yes.

1735
02:35:15.500 --> 02:35:17.500
19 yays, 1 nay.

1736
02:35:17.500 --> 02:35:19.500
Thank you very much.

1737
02:35:19.500 --> 02:35:27.500
You know, I was just thinking a little bit about the chairs of all these oversights.

1738
02:35:27.500 --> 02:35:35.500
There's one that represents a mile around teacher shortage, and our chair was Senator Jay Kahn.

1739
02:35:35.500 --> 02:35:53.500
And Jay is now retired to the other side of the state, and we need to have the Senate grab a hold of that and put people onto that committee so we can continue that work.

1740
02:35:53.500 --> 02:36:05.500
That's one of the problems that we encounter with who's chair and all that, because we don't have a chair of that committee now.

1741
02:36:05.500 --> 02:36:10.500
The chair calls the meetings, and that's the Senate bill.

1742
02:36:10.500 --> 02:36:12.500
Yep, Representative Cascada.

1743
02:36:12.500 --> 02:36:14.500
Just a question.

1744
02:36:14.500 --> 02:36:22.000
Did you say that we would get the spreadsheets today on the breakout of 529?

1745
02:36:22.000 --> 02:36:34.500
That's why a number of us went in to that finance, because I was under the impression that they were going to be handed out.

1746
02:36:34.500 --> 02:36:37.000
They were not handed out.

1747
02:36:37.000 --> 02:36:39.000
Oh, they weren't.

1748
02:36:39.000 --> 02:36:42.500
And I don't think they're available yet.

1749
02:36:42.500 --> 02:36:44.500
Okay.

1750
02:36:44.500 --> 02:36:47.000
And they will be provided.

1751
02:36:47.000 --> 02:36:51.500
They're supposed to be coming out of the DOE.

1752
02:36:51.500 --> 02:36:53.500
Okay.

1753
02:36:53.500 --> 02:36:58.500
I know that Division II had a meeting this afternoon.

1754
02:36:58.500 --> 02:37:06.000
I don't know if they received something then or not while we've been doing this.

1755
02:37:06.000 --> 02:37:08.000
Okay.

1756
02:37:08.000 --> 02:37:12.000
But we're not sitting here until they come.

1757
02:37:12.000 --> 02:37:14.000
No.

1758
02:37:14.000 --> 02:37:20.000
In fact, we're not going to be doing any more execing today.

1759
02:37:20.000 --> 02:37:25.500
We're going to stop it right here and adjourn this meeting.

1760
02:37:25.500 --> 02:37:27.500
Are you sure?

1761
02:37:27.500 --> 02:37:29.500
It's early.

1762
02:37:29.500 --> 02:37:32.000
It's going on 20th 3.

1763
02:37:32.000 --> 02:37:36.500
Well, we're going to exec what we can tomorrow.

1764
02:37:36.500 --> 02:37:41.000
All our hearings will be completed here real shortly.

1765
02:37:41.000 --> 02:37:49.000
All we have left is execing, and we can accomplish that during the month of March.

1766
02:37:49.000 --> 02:37:51.000
Any problems with that?

1767
02:37:51.000 --> 02:37:53.000
We will do so.

1768
02:37:53.000 --> 02:37:56.500
All of our early bills are done.

1769
02:37:56.500 --> 02:37:59.500
All our early bills are done.

1770
02:37:59.500 --> 02:38:04.000
OK, we had three early bills we had today.

1771
02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:06.000
We exact them.

1772
02:38:06.000 --> 02:38:08.000
So we're good.

1773
02:38:08.000 --> 02:38:10.000
So, Mr.

1774
02:38:10.000 --> 02:38:12.000
Chair, if I could.

1775
02:38:12.000 --> 02:38:14.000
Yeah.

1776
02:38:14.000 --> 02:38:19.000
We retained HB 437, so it's still in our possession.

1777
02:38:19.000 --> 02:38:29.500
And I did do an amendment to it, and I was hoping that the body would take another look at that.

1778
02:38:29.500 --> 02:38:44.000
And we received a very important letter, I think, a couple of days ago, and I have copies of it, but if I could just read it to you.

1779
02:38:44.000 --> 02:38:46.000
It's to the committee.

1780
02:38:46.000 --> 02:38:59.500
I am writing to you in regard to my concern for New Hampshire Public Schools, current method of teaching and reading, and my support for HB 437.

1781
02:38:59.500 --> 02:39:05.000
I am currently a reading specialist in a Concord public school.

1782
02:39:05.000 --> 02:39:10.000
I have been an educator in Concord for 25 years.

1783
02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:23.000
In the past three years, I began a journey in learning a lot about the research that has been coming to light regarding reading and instruction.

1784
02:39:23.000 --> 02:39:27.000
It has been an enlightening but emotional journey.

1785
02:39:27.000 --> 02:39:33.000
I was taught and had previously been implementing a balanced literacy approach.

1786
02:39:33.000 --> 02:39:44.000
This was all I knew, and I was led to believe that it was a well-supported way of teaching children to read.

1787
02:39:44.000 --> 02:40:01.500
I always questioned some things in the back of my mind and was concerned that no matter how hard we taught using this method, we never saw a great shift in children's ability to read.

1788
02:40:01.500 --> 02:40:06.500
Our Title I students were Title I students for life.

1789
02:40:06.500 --> 02:40:10.500
This is not how it's supposed to be.

1790
02:40:10.500 --> 02:40:20.500
Our test scores also tell a story that something isn't working, but I did what I was told until now.

1791
02:40:20.500 --> 02:40:28.500
Now I have spent countless hours reading the research myself directly from cognitive scientists and neuroscientists.

1792
02:40:28.500 --> 02:40:37.500
I see that we were wrong, especially in regard to the 3-Qing system that we have been misguided.

1793
02:40:37.500 --> 02:40:51.000
I am extremely concerned that if we don't make a drastic change to how we approach teaching reading, it may be too late for too many children.

1794
02:40:51.000 --> 02:41:03.000
By implementing the 3-queuing system, we actually change the wiring in children's brains so that they were at risk for never becoming good readers.

1795
02:41:03.000 --> 02:41:09.000
I have seen too many of these curriculum casualties as reading specialists.

1796
02:41:09.000 --> 02:41:18.500
These are students that should never have needed my help if they had received proper instruction from the beginning.

1797
02:41:18.500 --> 02:41:21.500
You can help stop this cycle.

1798
02:41:21.500 --> 02:41:36.000
The items in this bill will force the hand of many schools that may try and keep one foot in balanced literacy, which will not provide the change needed.

1799
02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:43.500
We, public schools, need to be held accountable to all the learners entrusted to us.

1800
02:41:43.500 --> 02:41:52.000
We need to be sure that we are giving them the absolute possible best chance of success.

1801
02:41:52.000 --> 02:41:57.500
This bill can bring us one step closer to that possibility.

1802
02:41:57.500 --> 02:42:11.500
I, for the sake of the New Hampshire children, please pass this bill and allow those of us ready to begin a better path to do this work.

1803
02:42:11.500 --> 02:42:14.000
Yeah, yeah, that's the run.

1804
02:42:14.000 --> 02:42:17.500
Okay, we've retained that, so we have?

1805
02:42:17.500 --> 02:42:19.500
No.

1806
02:42:19.500 --> 02:42:22.000
We have the dyslexia bill.

1807
02:42:22.000 --> 02:42:24.000
Yeah.

1808
02:42:24.000 --> 02:42:26.000
Okay.

1809
02:42:26.000 --> 02:42:29.500
So what's the number of that bill?

1810
02:42:29.500 --> 02:42:31.500
377.

1811
02:42:31.500 --> 02:42:33.500
377, when is it?

1812
02:42:33.500 --> 02:42:39.000
I don't think you see that later on in the doctor.

1813
02:42:39.000 --> 02:42:41.000
You're hugging them.

1814
02:42:41.000 --> 02:42:43.000
I'm holding them all.

1815
02:42:43.000 --> 02:42:46.000
It wasn't an FN or anything.

1816
02:42:46.000 --> 02:42:49.000
I was looking for like four.

1817
02:42:49.000 --> 02:42:51.000
Today's Wednesday, right?

1818
02:42:51.000 --> 02:43:00.500
And then we're looking at we have a whole lot of we don't have 377 on here at all.

1819
02:43:00.500 --> 02:43:03.000
Did we act on 377?

1820
02:43:03.000 --> 02:43:05.500
Not yet, I don't think.

1821
02:43:05.500 --> 02:43:15.500
Okay, so if you're asking for us to take action on 377, it's not really on the list at all.

1822
02:43:15.500 --> 02:43:18.000
And that's the other bill.

1823
02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:22.000
And this one right here, we have retained.

1824
02:43:22.000 --> 02:43:24.500
So there'd be a question.

1825
02:43:24.500 --> 02:43:28.500
There's several questions on procedure that I have.

1826
02:43:28.500 --> 02:43:30.500
Go ahead.

1827
02:43:30.500 --> 02:43:32.500
You have a question?

1828
02:43:32.500 --> 02:43:34.500
No.

1829
02:43:34.500 --> 02:43:36.500
Oh, Reps and Alexis?

1830
02:43:36.500 --> 02:45:12.000
For the bills that we've retained, do we have study committees started on those so that we can be actually working on them we had several work sessions on on bills which we've now acted upon we haven't set up any subcommittees on the retained bills at this point in time no we haven't And we haven't retained that many bills compared to what we i'm sure in looking at this list here uh and i think everybody ought to be looking at this list so when we do exact we can exact quickly um there's a number of bills that are probably going to be that could end up with uh no recommendation and we know where that went yesterday um that's correct you know we're going to stop the clocks in the in the in the hall someday and just have to stay there i guess and finish this stuff but um i i think what we need to do is look at this and say and i i probably need to get together with uh represent represent a miler here and find out which ones are these bills.

1831
02:45:12.000 --> 02:45:17.000
We just haven't had the time to sit down together.

1832
02:45:17.000 --> 02:45:19.000
At least I haven't.

1833
02:45:19.000 --> 02:45:23.000
And we have sat down quite a bit.

1834
02:45:23.000 --> 02:45:31.000
But we've been sitting down on the early bills and trying to develop a process there.

1835
02:45:31.000 --> 02:45:35.500
And I think the process has worked out wonderfully.

1836
02:45:35.500 --> 02:46:17.500
We got some stuff done today that first blush or first time we saw those i would have said this is not going to make it because one side or the other is going to be voting against it we voted these things out today because we looked at policy and we know there's an opportunity either on the floor but later on in finance to really address so many issues that have come, like the one you brought forward earlier today, Representative Luckett.

1837
02:46:17.500 --> 02:46:32.500
So I think that what we ought to do is I need to get together with leadership on the other side and find out which ones can we get through.

1838
02:46:32.500 --> 02:46:36.500
I'm looking at this laundry list right here.

1839
02:46:36.500 --> 02:46:41.500
I was looking at the time that we have available.

1840
02:46:41.500 --> 02:46:51.500
Now, the reports that we did today have to be in today, seeing that tomorrow we're going to have hearings.

1841
02:46:51.500 --> 02:46:56.000
And so I want to give them to Lindsay.

1842
02:46:56.000 --> 02:47:03.000
And I had to get the schedule for the next week done today also.

1843
02:47:03.000 --> 02:47:05.000
That's done.

1844
02:47:05.000 --> 02:47:16.500
So I guess that I'd rather not have to go through exact things at quarter of three here, starting out on this list.

1845
02:47:16.500 --> 02:47:20.000
We could be here a long time.

1846
02:47:20.000 --> 02:47:39.000
We could shortcut the time, maybe, if I sit down with Representative Meiler and we go through these things and say, which ones do we have, you know, folks that will go one way or the other on?

1847
02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:45.000
And it's always an assumption because that's not how everybody turns out.

1848
02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:50.500
So, you know, I can't read your minds, but Representative Cordelli.

1849
02:47:50.500 --> 02:48:00.500
Yeah, I was just wondering if a motion to reconsider on 437 would be a proper motion at this time.

1850
02:48:00.500 --> 02:48:11.500
Well, the bill has not left our possession, and I've never had a retained bill where we've had a motion for reconsideration.

1851
02:48:11.500 --> 02:48:18.500
I'd like to find out from the clerk whether that's allowable in our rules.

1852
02:48:18.500 --> 02:49:10.500
yeah before we do that if it is allowable we can you know we'll reconsider it um because you're asking for it right now we'll reconsider it um at a time that's you know if we have to properly post it we'll do that if not um because it's it's a germane amendment or do you have a germane or just or not not add anything you're right get the bill tweaking a couple of things okay yeah represent belcher and mr chairman if it requires when the time comes, having voted with a majority on that, I would make the motion to reconsider.

1853
02:49:10.500 --> 02:49:19.000
You don't, you can, in committee, you don't have to be in the majority or the minority.

1854
02:49:19.000 --> 02:49:25.000
Anybody can ask for reconsideration on any bill, regardless how you voted.

1855
02:49:25.000 --> 02:49:29.500
Yes, that's not the same on the floor, though.

1856
02:49:29.500 --> 02:49:31.500
Representative Lekas.

1857
02:49:31.500 --> 02:49:39.000
So I did come up with, I did get the amendment, and I have it.

1858
02:49:39.000 --> 02:49:51.500
It was according on the cursive writing and multiplication table bill that was, the amendment was just putting it to what we had agreed on.

1859
02:49:51.500 --> 02:49:55.500
And so can we do that as well?

1860
02:49:55.500 --> 02:50:05.000
Reconsider that to put in that amendment rather than the one that wasn't quite what we had agreed on?

1861
02:50:05.000 --> 02:50:07.000
It was very simple.

1862
02:50:07.000 --> 02:50:10.000
What was the number of that?

1863
02:50:10.000 --> 02:50:13.500
I can tell you in a moment.

1864
02:50:13.500 --> 02:50:15.500
71.

1865
02:50:15.500 --> 02:50:17.500
Was it 71?

1866
02:50:17.500 --> 02:50:19.500
Yeah.

1867
02:50:19.500 --> 02:50:21.500
No.

1868
02:50:21.500 --> 02:50:24.000
No, no, no, not 71.

1869
02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:26.500
It was, that's not it.

1870
02:50:26.500 --> 02:50:28.500
170.

1871
02:50:28.500 --> 02:50:30.500
170, yeah, yeah.

1872
02:50:30.500 --> 02:50:32.500
Yeah.

1873
02:50:32.500 --> 02:50:34.500
NNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN want.

1874
02:50:34.500 --> 02:50:36.500
170.

1875
02:50:36.500 --> 02:50:39.500
Have we acted on that bill?

1876
02:50:39.500 --> 02:50:41.500
We recessed.

1877
02:50:41.500 --> 02:50:43.500
It's on hold, yeah.

1878
02:50:43.500 --> 02:50:45.500
It's on hold.

1879
02:50:45.500 --> 02:50:47.500
We did.

1880
02:50:47.500 --> 02:50:49.500
We did.

1881
02:50:49.500 --> 02:50:55.000
We passed the other amendment that wasn't quite what we wanted.

1882
02:50:55.000 --> 02:50:57.000
We OTPA'd it.

1883
02:50:57.000 --> 02:51:02.000
Then we had a motion to ITL, and we recessed.

1884
02:51:02.000 --> 02:51:04.000
At that point.

1885
02:51:04.000 --> 02:51:06.000
At that point.

1886
02:51:06.000 --> 02:51:23.500
And so can we go back and reconsider and look at, or whatever we have to do to look at, the amendment that was the agreed upon amendment and take a vote on that amendment?

1887
02:51:23.500 --> 02:51:29.000
Let me, again, let me do some checking on that process.

1888
02:51:29.000 --> 02:51:31.000
Okay.

1889
02:51:31.000 --> 02:51:33.000
Yeah.

1890
02:51:33.000 --> 02:51:35.500
Because I do have it.

1891
02:51:35.500 --> 02:51:38.500
I did it right that day.

1892
02:51:38.500 --> 02:51:41.000
Any other discussion for today?

1893
02:51:41.000 --> 02:51:43.000
We're done.

1894
02:51:43.000 --> 02:51:46.000
We have about half, 15 minutes.

1895
02:51:46.000 --> 02:51:48.000
Yeah, I will.

1896
02:51:48.000 --> 02:51:51.500
Let's give us some copies of this.

1897
02:51:51.500 --> 02:51:53.500
Yeah.

1898
02:51:53.500 --> 02:51:55.500
I wonder if Tony's...

1899
02:51:55.500 --> 02:51:57.500
Thank you.

1900
02:51:57.500 --> 02:52:00.000
I'm going to swallow it.

1901
02:52:00.000 --> 02:52:03.500
I have my big binder on bills.

1902
02:52:03.500 --> 02:52:09.000
The ones we accepted, they were early bills, so we can't.

1903
02:52:09.000 --> 02:52:13.000
Yeah, I think that's that's got a financial.

1904
02:52:13.000 --> 02:52:28.500
the one deal with uh uh can't go oh right that that's got a financial that they're not no oh i want to show you something they all got Thank you.

1905
02:52:28.500 --> 02:52:30.500
Thank you.

1906
02:52:30.500 --> 02:52:32.500
Thank you.

1907
02:52:32.500 --> 02:52:34.500
Thank you.

1908
02:52:34.500 --> 02:52:36.500
Thank you.

1909
02:52:36.500 --> 02:52:38.500
Thank you.

1910
02:52:38.500 --> 02:52:40.500
Thank you.

1911

Thank you.

1912
02:52:42.500 --> 02:52:44.500
Thank you.

1913
02:52:44.500 --> 02:52:46.500
Thank you.
