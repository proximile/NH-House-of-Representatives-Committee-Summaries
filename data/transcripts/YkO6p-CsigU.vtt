the hearing on House Bill 1522 and I
 
00:04:35.189 --> 00:04:35.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
McKenzie my name is
 
00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:43.870 align:start position:0%
McKenzie my name is
mesent

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:48.639 align:start position:0%
HRI is your mic on thank you it is
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
now thank you for all reminding
 
00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 align:start position:0%
me so this bill
 
00:04:59.029 --> 00:04:59.039 align:start position:0%
um deals with an issue of increasing the
 
00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:01.919 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits the they have not
 
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
been adjusted since two 2007 in fact
 
00:05:06.749 --> 00:05:06.759 align:start position:0%
representative infant time was part of
 
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
the bill that adjust them the last time
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
they were done um so this expands takes
 
00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:15.440 align:start position:0%
the existing structure and expands uh it
 
00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:17.720 align:start position:0%
as it appears in the current law taking
 
00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
the existing schedule I adjusted the
 
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
table by applying the Consumer Price
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
Index from the time of the last
 
00:05:27.469 --> 00:05:27.479 align:start position:0%
adjustment which is 2007 up until
 
00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
2017 in addition this bill creates an
 
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:32.080 align:start position:0%
additional 19 steps to expand the
 
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 align:start position:0%
schedule to accommodate the higher wage
 
00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
earners who lose out as a current
 
00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
schedule uh uh schedule stops at 415
 
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240 align:start position:0%
with a maximum Benefit of
 
00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 align:start position:0%
$427 Mr chairman I I neglected to pass
 
00:05:50.309 --> 00:05:50.319 align:start position:0%
out this little uh handout so feel free
 
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 align:start position:0%
um you want to pass one on down on
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
either side and
 
00:05:59.550 --> 00:05:59.560 align:start position:0%
uh leave one um if there's an empty seat
 
00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:01.240 align:start position:0%
folks just leave one and pass the rest
 
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 align:start position:0%
down if you wouldn't
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
mind the new schedule uh will bring the
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
top rate up to
 
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
$57,500 uh which is a maximum benefit of
 
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
$753 uh
 
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
$57,500 is approximately the amount
 
00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
needed to meet individual consumption
 
00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 align:start position:0%
costs such as rent medical
 
00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:26.520 align:start position:0%
transportation of food this amount Falls
 
00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:28.639 align:start position:0%
far short of the average weekly wage in
 
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire which is around $1,400 a
 
00:06:32.629 --> 00:06:32.639 align:start position:0%
week or
 
00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
7200 uh
 
00:06:38.070 --> 00:06:38.080 align:start position:0%
72,800 the current replacement rate at
 
00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 align:start position:0%
the bottom of the schedule was around
 
00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:42.520 align:start position:0%
60% of the average weekly wage and the
 
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:45.240 align:start position:0%
rate deteriorates from from that to
 
00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:48.240 align:start position:0%
about 28 to
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
32% uh because the fact that the current
 
00:06:53.749 --> 00:06:53.759 align:start position:0%
dollar amount for the top end of the
 
00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
schedule is $41,500
 
00:06:58.589 --> 00:06:58.599 align:start position:0%
so anything over and above that if
 
00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:01.319 align:start position:0%
you're making more than that uh that's
 
00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 align:start position:0%
where you top out at and there's going
 
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
to be evidence presented uh by the
 
00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:07.960 align:start position:0%
department to show that there are number
 
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:10.280 align:start position:0%
of people who actually hit that
 
00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
of people who actually hit that
threshold

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.410 align:start position:0%
threshold
 
00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:16.350 align:start position:0%
threshold
[Music]

00:07:16.350 --> 00:07:16.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:19.309 --> 00:07:19.319 align:start position:0%
um to help uh better understand I I
 
00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:20.919 align:start position:0%
don't know how many people are familiar
 
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:24.120 align:start position:0%
with the way that the UI system actually
 
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 align:start position:0%
works um so I wanted to give just a
 
00:07:30.629 --> 00:07:30.639 align:start position:0%
couple of minutes orientation about uh
 
00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 align:start position:0%
how I see the system works uh how the
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
money gets into the system and uh what
 
00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:38.639 align:start position:0%
the various taxes that employers pay in
 
00:07:40.309 --> 00:07:40.319 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire those of you
 
00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:44.199 align:start position:0%
who are employers uh understand fter and
 
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:47.360 align:start position:0%
sudor and bunch of other taxes that uh
 
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:50.000 align:start position:0%
that you have to pay so let me say this
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
that the initial uh this law was
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
initially passed as part of the the
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
Social Security Act it was Roosevelt's
 
00:08:01.589 --> 00:08:01.599 align:start position:0%
initiative to provide for safety nets
 
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:04.280 align:start position:0%
that under which people uh was put under
 
00:08:06.629 --> 00:08:06.639 align:start position:0%
people so they would not fall into into
 
00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
poverty so we went online back in the
 
00:08:13.469 --> 00:08:13.479 align:start position:0%
30s I think it was 30 36 37 maybe
 
00:08:16.070 --> 00:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
earlier than that with the UI system uh
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire and I
 
00:08:20.869 --> 00:08:20.879 align:start position:0%
actually have uh the initial all of the
 
00:08:23.550 --> 00:08:23.560 align:start position:0%
initial uh the initial law and all of
 
00:08:25.510 --> 00:08:25.520 align:start position:0%
the updates from the time the law was
 
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.790 align:start position:0%
the updates from the time the law was
initially

00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:26.800 align:start position:0%
initially
 
00:08:31.070 --> 00:08:31.080 align:start position:0%
passed so the money that comes into the
 
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:34.680 align:start position:0%
uh the unemployment fund uh says uh it
 
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
goes into a it goes into a federal fund
 
00:08:38.350 --> 00:08:38.360 align:start position:0%
called the trust fund the trust fund
 
00:08:41.029 --> 00:08:41.039 align:start position:0%
then uh draws down the state draws down
 
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
from the trust fund uh for the purpose
 
00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
of paying benefits and it can only be
 
00:08:49.110 --> 00:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
used uh to pay unemployment
 
00:08:51.990 --> 00:08:52.000 align:start position:0%
benefits uh and the what the law also
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
says is that uh the states cannot impose
 
00:08:57.310 --> 00:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
excessively burdensome methods of
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
administration that would block access
 
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:01.880 align:start position:0%
for otherwise eligible
 
00:09:04.509 --> 00:09:04.519 align:start position:0%
individuals these requirements sure that
 
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.040 align:start position:0%
the states maintain a program that
 
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
offers a basic level of protection to
 
00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:10.160 align:start position:0%
workers with sufficient uh employment
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
Records who lose their job through no
 
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
fault of their own and Within These
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
basic protection states are free to
 
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:18.720 align:start position:0%
choose and adjust the employer tax rate
 
00:09:20.829 --> 00:09:20.839 align:start position:0%
benefit levels and durations and that is
 
00:09:24.230 --> 00:09:24.240 align:start position:0%
an important thing to to understand is
 
00:09:26.990 --> 00:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
that this system uh and there many
 
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
people who think this is the wrong way
 
00:09:30.829 --> 00:09:30.839 align:start position:0%
to do it but the states under the this
 
00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:32.560 align:start position:0%
current system have the authority all
 
00:09:34.509 --> 00:09:34.519 align:start position:0%
throughout the country so every state
 
00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:36.320 align:start position:0%
has a different set of benefits every
 
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
state uh does things differently as
 
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
opposed to the uh in comparison to the
 
00:09:43.269 --> 00:09:43.279 align:start position:0%
Social Security system which is a
 
00:09:45.190 --> 00:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
national system and and National
 
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.040 align:start position:0%
benefits but that was the way it came
 
00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:51.680 align:start position:0%
out the the system itself accumulates
 
00:09:53.430 --> 00:09:53.440 align:start position:0%
money through two sources one is the
 
00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:55.920 align:start position:0%
Fooda tax uh which is a Federal
 
00:10:01.230 --> 00:10:01.240 align:start position:0%
Unemployment uh tax um and uh and that
 
00:10:03.949 --> 00:10:03.959 align:start position:0%
is based on uh the tax rate is 6% on the
 
00:10:03.959 --> 00:10:05.470 align:start position:0%
is based on uh the tax rate is 6% on the
first

00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:05.480 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:10:10.630 --> 00:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
$7,000 and so the maximum uh how you can
 
00:10:13.710 --> 00:10:13.720 align:start position:0%
qualify for benefits a lower that rate
 
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:16.920 align:start position:0%
um but for the most part uh you can go
 
00:10:21.269 --> 00:10:21.279 align:start position:0%
as low as 6% but the but the max you pay
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
is $420 for the food attx and it comes
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
down as depending on on various factors
 
00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:30.670 align:start position:0%
down as depending on on various factors
um

00:10:30.670 --> 00:10:30.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:33.069 --> 00:10:33.079 align:start position:0%
the pseud tax on the other hand is
 
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
variable and set by the states so the
 
00:10:38.030 --> 00:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
state sets individual
 
00:10:41.190 --> 00:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
rates uh and the way that's done in a
 
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
nutshell is that uh there is a tax a
 
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:48.720 align:start position:0%
suit tax begins at 2. 7
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
2.7% and then is adjusted based on uh
 
00:10:55.949 --> 00:10:55.959 align:start position:0%
the experience of the of the of the
 
00:10:58.470 --> 00:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
employer higher number of people laid
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
off the more expensive it is uh
 
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
depending on what industry you're in if
 
00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160 align:start position:0%
you're in construction as opposed to
 
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
office work if it's a more stable
 
00:11:09.550 --> 00:11:09.560 align:start position:0%
environment you tend to have a lower uh
 
00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:12.440 align:start position:0%
a lower rate now that's a real quick
 
00:11:16.350 --> 00:11:16.360 align:start position:0%
pass at at how that works but every year
 
00:11:17.949 --> 00:11:17.959 align:start position:0%
they take a look and they look back and
 
00:11:19.829 --> 00:11:19.839 align:start position:0%
they say what was the experience of the
 
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:22.720 align:start position:0%
of the employer then they assign a rate
 
00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
um they assign a rate to the employer
 
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:26.480 align:start position:0%
and that's what they pay now beginning
 
00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:30.760 align:start position:0%
is 2.7 it can go up uh um and if you tip
 
00:11:32.629 --> 00:11:32.639 align:start position:0%
over there are two actually there's a
 
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:34.920 align:start position:0%
divide there those who are positive
 
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
rated employees and those are negative
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
rated employees the negative rated
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
employees take more out of the system
 
00:11:42.509 --> 00:11:42.519 align:start position:0%
than they put in and therefore they the
 
00:11:44.470 --> 00:11:44.480 align:start position:0%
rate tends to be
 
00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:46.069 align:start position:0%
rate tends to be
higher

00:11:46.069 --> 00:11:46.079 align:start position:0%
higher
 
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:49.200 align:start position:0%
um the the amount that you pay
 
00:11:52.590 --> 00:11:52.600 align:start position:0%
on uh is based on
 
00:11:55.430 --> 00:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
$114,000 that's the top end of the tax
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
so you can't ex you don't exceed that uh
 
00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:01.360 align:start position:0%
so so depending on what your rate is you
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
apply that to the 14,000 and that's how
 
00:12:06.030 --> 00:12:06.040 align:start position:0%
you make a determination as to what the
 
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:08.240 align:start position:0%
amount of money would
 
00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:20.110 align:start position:0%
amount of money would
be

00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:20.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
uh so all of this money that's collected
 
00:12:26.189 --> 00:12:26.199 align:start position:0%
ends up in what's known as the trust
 
00:12:29.389 --> 00:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
fund and uh the trust fund
 
00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:31.320 align:start position:0%
has a series of
 
00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:38.629 --> 00:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
applied and this is an important this is
 
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:40.600 align:start position:0%
an important thing
 
00:12:44.189 --> 00:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
because the trust fund uh has the uh
 
00:12:46.230 --> 00:12:46.240 align:start position:0%
depending on what the level of the of
 
00:12:48.310 --> 00:12:48.320 align:start position:0%
the dollar amount is or the trust fund
 
00:12:51.790 --> 00:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
at anyone particular time you they apply
 
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:53.240 align:start position:0%
a a half
 
00:12:56.230 --> 00:12:56.240 align:start position:0%
perc uh and the schedule uh equals or
 
00:13:00.030 --> 00:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
exceeds 250 million uh if it goes above
 
00:13:03.189 --> 00:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
uh 350 million there's another discount
 
00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:06.440 align:start position:0%
they go above 400 uh million there's
 
00:13:08.189 --> 00:13:08.199 align:start position:0%
another discount and they are very close
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
right now uh to getting to that point
 
00:13:12.550 --> 00:13:12.560 align:start position:0%
where the trust fund will have some $400
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
million in
 
00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:17.800 align:start position:0%
it you can pay uh if you to think the
 
00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:20.600 align:start position:0%
lowest you can pay in the state is um
 
00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:23.000 align:start position:0%
from what I remember is
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
0.1% uh because depending on what your
 
00:13:27.430 --> 00:13:27.440 align:start position:0%
rate is how you're rated and then you
 
00:13:30.509 --> 00:13:30.519 align:start position:0%
apply these discounts it's low
 
00:13:33.389 --> 00:13:33.399 align:start position:0%
again um there's two things in play here
 
00:13:35.750 --> 00:13:35.760 align:start position:0%
there's the there's a the amount of
 
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:37.880 align:start position:0%
money that can be collected which are
 
00:13:41.629 --> 00:13:41.639 align:start position:0%
tax taxable wages and uh that goes into
 
00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:44.440 align:start position:0%
the trust fund
 
00:13:47.189 --> 00:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
now over the time what they have done is
 
00:13:47.199 --> 00:13:49.030 align:start position:0%
now over the time what they have done is
to

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:13:52.230 --> 00:13:52.240 align:start position:0%
um is to change that 14,000 I think it
 
00:13:54.590 --> 00:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
was 10,000 they maybe gone to 12 the
 
00:13:56.710 --> 00:13:56.720 align:start position:0%
last time they went up to
 
00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:00.240 align:start position:0%
14,000 and uh for the average employer
 
00:14:01.790 --> 00:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire at least from what I
 
00:14:04.189 --> 00:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
could see in 2002 it was about New
 
00:14:06.829 --> 00:14:06.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ended up with about
 
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
$359 uh per employee but I think you're
 
00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
going to hear that that's actually much
 
00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:14.600 align:start position:0%
less uh than uh the employees are
 
00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.470 align:start position:0%
less uh than uh the employees are
currently

00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:19.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.030 align:start position:0%
 
paying

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:21.040 align:start position:0%
paying
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
now what
 
00:14:25.910 --> 00:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
um what happens is that and you could
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
see on on page six I think of the
 
00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880 align:start position:0%
handout on the what's known as trust
 
00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:30.870 align:start position:0%
handout on the what's known as trust
fund

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:30.880 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:14:33.150 --> 00:14:33.160 align:start position:0%
solvency um this is getting a little in
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
the weeds and probably wouldn't do this
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
for other committees but those of us
 
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
who're going to deal with this these
 
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
issues of unemployment I think it's
 
00:14:42.509 --> 00:14:42.519 align:start position:0%
important to understand so trust fund
 
00:14:46.670 --> 00:14:46.680 align:start position:0%
solvency is a is a is a uh a number that
 
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
a target number that they're looking at
 
00:14:52.110 --> 00:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
so the federal government says uh one is
 
00:14:55.030 --> 00:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
the is the target number uh that takes
 
00:14:56.629 --> 00:14:56.639 align:start position:0%
into consideration it's a bunch of
 
00:14:59.670 --> 00:14:59.680 align:start position:0%
different factors but the trust fund
 
00:15:02.069 --> 00:15:02.079 align:start position:0%
solvency is a way to look and compare
 
00:15:04.590 --> 00:15:04.600 align:start position:0%
one state to another looks at at at
 
00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
where you are in terms of your your
 
00:15:11.949 --> 00:15:11.959 align:start position:0%
solvency um New Hampshire is is uh the
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
last look at this thing in 2023 they
 
00:15:18.749 --> 00:15:18.759 align:start position:0%
were uh uh 0. n uh and they want to be
 
00:15:21.269 --> 00:15:21.279 align:start position:0%
at one and I think they I think they're
 
00:15:23.069 --> 00:15:23.079 align:start position:0%
already there I'm not you know better
 
00:15:25.069 --> 00:15:25.079 align:start position:0%
from these guys uh but I think they're
 
00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
almost actually there on page seven you
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
can see the top of page seven you can
 
00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:32.920 align:start position:0%
see what the um what the what it would
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
look like if you were to take a look at
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
at the report that's uh the federal
 
00:15:40.590 --> 00:15:40.600 align:start position:0%
government has that that looks at trust
 
00:15:42.629 --> 00:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
fund solvency issues and that's an
 
00:15:44.189 --> 00:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
important number because it gives you a
 
00:15:47.150 --> 00:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
sense as a as a uh without digging too
 
00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:49.440 align:start position:0%
deep as to where this fund overall the
 
00:15:49.440 --> 00:15:51.110 align:start position:0%
deep as to where this fund overall the
fund

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:15:54.110 --> 00:15:54.120 align:start position:0%
is now the cost of the benefits the
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
benefits for the unemployed workers have
 
00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:57.800 align:start position:0%
not been raised by the legislation more
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
than 17 years years and even when it was
 
00:16:04.150 --> 00:16:04.160 align:start position:0%
raised back 17 years ago it only
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
Incorporated the top it added some
 
00:16:07.749 --> 00:16:07.759 align:start position:0%
additional steps to the top three or
 
00:16:09.309 --> 00:16:09.319 align:start position:0%
four steps to the
 
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
top the current uh system has uh no
 
00:16:15.509 --> 00:16:15.519 align:start position:0%
automatic mechanism for increasing
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
benefits and this is I think where the
 
00:16:19.749 --> 00:16:19.759 align:start position:0%
rubber hits the road in terms of the
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
policy piece because every time uh you
 
00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:26.480 align:start position:0%
want an increase in the in the um in the
 
00:16:29.309 --> 00:16:29.319 align:start position:0%
benefit then you need to come in and to
 
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
the legisl file legislation as we're
 
00:16:34.550 --> 00:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
doing here to increase that that
 
00:16:38.030 --> 00:16:38.040 align:start position:0%
benefit and traditionally what happens
 
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
is because employers this is an employer
 
00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.110 align:start position:0%
is because employers this is an employer
funded

00:16:43.110 --> 00:16:43.120 align:start position:0%
funded
 
00:16:47.069 --> 00:16:47.079 align:start position:0%
uh uh program the employeers naturally
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
react to that because as you raise the
 
00:16:51.949 --> 00:16:51.959 align:start position:0%
benefits it's going to become more
 
00:16:55.309 --> 00:16:55.319 align:start position:0%
expensive uh for employers the question
 
00:16:57.350 --> 00:16:57.360 align:start position:0%
I think from a policy perspective is at
 
00:17:01.230 --> 00:17:01.240 align:start position:0%
what point um what what is what is the
 
00:17:04.630 --> 00:17:04.640 align:start position:0%
number that we need to get to from the
 
00:17:06.949 --> 00:17:06.959 align:start position:0%
from the perspective of what's fair and
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
what's Equitable and what meets the
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
mission of the organization and I asked
 
00:17:13.789 --> 00:17:13.799 align:start position:0%
that question the other day in front of
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee and I pretty much
 
00:17:19.150 --> 00:17:19.160 align:start position:0%
knew the answer there is no number there
 
00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:22.520 align:start position:0%
is no recommendation from uh at least
 
00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:25.240 align:start position:0%
from the uh from the
 
00:17:27.909 --> 00:17:27.919 align:start position:0%
system uh as to what that number should
 
00:17:27.919 --> 00:17:29.070 align:start position:0%
system uh as to what that number should
be

00:17:29.070 --> 00:17:29.080 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
so what's happened in New Hampshire is
 
00:17:35.190 --> 00:17:35.200 align:start position:0%
that the number the the benefit has
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
continued to slide and decline uh with
 
00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:41.520 align:start position:0%
time which is where we're at right now
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
now you the problem with where we are
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
and we do we've seen this in other
 
00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:49.880 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation is it has fallen
 
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:52.120 align:start position:0%
behind and it gets increasingly more
 
00:17:54.470 --> 00:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
expensive to catch up even if you would
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
to just catch up by using the CPI the
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
current system it gets more expensive
 
00:18:01.470 --> 00:18:01.480 align:start position:0%
expensive to catch up so that if the
 
00:18:03.430 --> 00:18:03.440 align:start position:0%
system is in place and the
 
00:18:05.149 --> 00:18:05.159 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the system and the
 
00:18:07.270 --> 00:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
goal of the system is provide
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
replacement wages at time when people
 
00:18:11.470 --> 00:18:11.480 align:start position:0%
through no fault of their own are
 
00:18:13.710 --> 00:18:13.720 align:start position:0%
unemployed we have to we have to take
 
00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:14.789 align:start position:0%
unemployed we have to we have to take
into

00:18:14.789 --> 00:18:14.799 align:start position:0%
into
 
00:18:17.070 --> 00:18:17.080 align:start position:0%
consideration how adequate the current
 
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
benefit is and where we think that needs
 
00:18:20.990 --> 00:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
to be from a policy perspective and
 
00:18:23.230 --> 00:18:23.240 align:start position:0%
clearly that's our job it's not the
 
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:25.080 align:start position:0%
Department's job they've made that uh
 
00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:26.230 align:start position:0%
Department's job they've made that uh
pretty

00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
00:18:31.310 --> 00:18:31.320 align:start position:0%
clear but if you look at the um in 1977
 
00:18:34.390 --> 00:18:34.400 align:start position:0%
what they did is the uh is they they put
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
in this is in the Preamble of the the
 
00:18:39.590 --> 00:18:39.600 align:start position:0%
state law uh and I was surprised to see
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
it but it's there and here's what it
 
00:18:42.990 --> 00:18:43.000 align:start position:0%
here's basically what the legislature in
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
1977 said it says now therefore the
 
00:18:48.270 --> 00:18:48.280 align:start position:0%
general court declares the public good
 
00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
and the general welfare of workers in
 
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
the state requir the enactment of
 
00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:54.720 align:start position:0%
workers compensation laws providing for
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
setting aside of unemployed reserves to
 
00:18:58.390 --> 00:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
be used for the benefit purpose of
 
00:19:00.630 --> 00:19:00.640 align:start position:0%
unemployed through uh through no fault
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
of their own and for providing a
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
systematic accumulation of funds so the
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
legislates uh you know says that it's
 
00:19:10.669 --> 00:19:10.679 align:start position:0%
that providing these benefits is
 
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:12.520 align:start position:0%
important that's what they decided that
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
was the thing that they that they uh put
 
00:19:17.390 --> 00:19:17.400 align:start position:0%
into the law and it's currently in
 
00:19:21.870 --> 00:19:21.880 align:start position:0%
the the um currently in the book
 
00:19:24.350 --> 00:19:24.360 align:start position:0%
now here's here's the thing about
 
00:19:26.950 --> 00:19:26.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment from my experience it
 
00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
serves two real purposes uh in the state
 
00:19:32.789 --> 00:19:32.799 align:start position:0%
the first thing is to provide support
 
00:19:34.430 --> 00:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
for unemployed workers when they are
 
00:19:37.669 --> 00:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
laid off to no fault of their own and it
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
also stabilizes the economy in the state
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire now I worked on the uh
 
00:19:46.710 --> 00:19:46.720 align:start position:0%
the shutdown of the plant the paper
 
00:19:49.710 --> 00:19:49.720 align:start position:0%
plant in Berlin New Hampshire and if you
 
00:19:51.510 --> 00:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
wanted to see what happens when a
 
00:19:54.190 --> 00:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
shutdown occurs now that's a very unique
 
00:19:57.310 --> 00:19:57.320 align:start position:0%
situation it was a one hos town and when
 
00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:00.200 align:start position:0%
that shut down it destroyed the economy
 
00:20:01.710 --> 00:20:01.720 align:start position:0%
in the in the state of New Hampshire in
 
00:20:04.029 --> 00:20:04.039 align:start position:0%
in that part of the state but for the
 
00:20:04.039 --> 00:20:05.310 align:start position:0%
in that part of the state but for the
unemployment

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:05.320 align:start position:0%
unemployment
 
00:20:07.870 --> 00:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
system those workers would have have
 
00:20:10.230 --> 00:20:10.240 align:start position:0%
nothing and getting them back to work
 
00:20:12.549 --> 00:20:12.559 align:start position:0%
was even a bigger issue and we spent a
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
long time and a lot of money uh trying
 
00:20:18.430 --> 00:20:18.440 align:start position:0%
to get those those workers stabilized so
 
00:20:20.590 --> 00:20:20.600 align:start position:0%
so unemployment in that case that
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
example shows that it has a role of
 
00:20:26.789 --> 00:20:26.799 align:start position:0%
stabilizing communities and a role of
 
00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
providing benefits for work workers but
 
00:20:32.149 --> 00:20:32.159 align:start position:0%
the other thing that it does is it keeps
 
00:20:35.149 --> 00:20:35.159 align:start position:0%
intact the workforce that we currently
 
00:20:37.390 --> 00:20:37.400 align:start position:0%
have in New Hampshire if there were no
 
00:20:39.390 --> 00:20:39.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment system there's a good
 
00:20:40.990 --> 00:20:41.000 align:start position:0%
possibility workers would leave the
 
00:20:43.110 --> 00:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
state to look for other work they'd be
 
00:20:45.669 --> 00:20:45.679 align:start position:0%
forced to so if you want as an employer
 
00:20:49.390 --> 00:20:49.400 align:start position:0%
to maintain a Workforce in the state and
 
00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
keep them during times of economic uh
 
00:20:55.070 --> 00:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
Cycles then unemployment helps to to
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
serve that
 
00:20:57.120 --> 00:20:59.710 align:start position:0%
serve that
purpose

00:20:59.710 --> 00:20:59.720 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:03.480 align:start position:0%
now on page um on page nine at the top
 
00:21:06.669 --> 00:21:06.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.110 --> 00:21:10.120 align:start position:0%
schedule and what this shows is that the
 
00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:11.960 align:start position:0%
the top of the SC I'm sorry that it's a
 
00:21:13.870 --> 00:21:13.880 align:start position:0%
little it's not going to be as pretty as
 
00:21:15.350 --> 00:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
the department ofemployment security
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
stuff that's coming up
 
00:21:23.110 --> 00:21:23.120 align:start position:0%
shortly um but what that shows is this
 
00:21:25.909 --> 00:21:25.919 align:start position:0%
is going to be about the cost issue so
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
the top of the scale on the right right
 
00:21:31.870 --> 00:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
hand side refers to the wages that are U
 
00:21:33.909 --> 00:21:33.919 align:start position:0%
being generated in the state of New
 
00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:36.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire it's called the total taxable
 
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
wages and you can see that that had that
 
00:21:41.909 --> 00:21:41.919 align:start position:0%
number has gone up considerably over the
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
course of the
 
00:21:45.830 --> 00:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
years the bottom is the percent of total
 
00:21:48.230 --> 00:21:48.240 align:start position:0%
wages that are taxable under the current
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
system and you can see the
 
00:21:53.269 --> 00:21:53.279 align:start position:0%
relationship the tax of the wages are
 
00:21:55.470 --> 00:21:55.480 align:start position:0%
going up the amount of wages are going
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
up but the relationship uh is is
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
declining so there's less and less uh as
 
00:22:04.710 --> 00:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
I see understand that there were less
 
00:22:07.269 --> 00:22:07.279 align:start position:0%
wages uh percent of total wages that are
 
00:22:10.630 --> 00:22:10.640 align:start position:0%
being taxed in the state so there is
 
00:22:13.230 --> 00:22:13.240 align:start position:0%
some room there when we look at at uh
 
00:22:15.430 --> 00:22:15.440 align:start position:0%
how we designed this bill there is some
 
00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.630 align:start position:0%
how we designed this bill there is some
room

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:16.640 align:start position:0%
room
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
there let me
 
00:22:20.909 --> 00:22:20.919 align:start position:0%
um the the other thing there were a
 
00:22:23.590 --> 00:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
number of bills in the in the department
 
00:22:25.310 --> 00:22:25.320 align:start position:0%
uh in in play here not the in the
 
00:22:26.830 --> 00:22:26.840 align:start position:0%
department but in play I think the
 
00:22:28.630 --> 00:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
Senate's got two or three of them we may
 
00:22:30.630 --> 00:22:30.640 align:start position:0%
have a couple here as
 
00:22:33.269 --> 00:22:33.279 align:start position:0%
well and I think what need we need to
 
00:22:35.630 --> 00:22:35.640 align:start position:0%
take a look at is the next uh is maybe
 
00:22:38.149 --> 00:22:38.159 align:start position:0%
spend a little bit of time digging into
 
00:22:40.430 --> 00:22:40.440 align:start position:0%
the unemployment system and taking a
 
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:42.760 align:start position:0%
look at at some of the things and then
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
trying to come together now what I
 
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:50.880 align:start position:0%
proposed uh in 1522 is to raise the
 
00:22:54.190 --> 00:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
scale and when you begin to look at
 
00:22:58.149 --> 00:22:58.159 align:start position:0%
you'll hear you'll hear some of this um
 
00:23:01.549 --> 00:23:01.559 align:start position:0%
the replacement value is on my bill is
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
in the 70 some odd percent range
 
00:23:07.149 --> 00:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
currently it's uh around 50 depends on
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
where you are in the scale but it's in
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
the 50 or 60% range for the lower end of
 
00:23:10.919 --> 00:23:12.110 align:start position:0%
the 50 or 60% range for the lower end of
the

00:23:12.110 --> 00:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
scale you what's the ideal number I
 
00:23:17.789 --> 00:23:17.799 align:start position:0%
think probably as as I look at at and
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
talk to the me from the Department I
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
think the numbers that I propose are too
 
00:23:25.789 --> 00:23:25.799 align:start position:0%
high and I'm wide open to amending that
 
00:23:27.950 --> 00:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
but I think we have to uh make sure that
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
we protect the higher wage uh earners in
 
00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:32.840 align:start position:0%
the state which are losing out uh and
 
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:34.240 align:start position:0%
there's some evidence to show how many
 
00:23:38.230 --> 00:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
of them are and this uh this legislation
 
00:23:41.950 --> 00:23:41.960 align:start position:0%
attempts to do that let me just say and
 
00:23:43.110 --> 00:23:43.120 align:start position:0%
finish up
 
00:23:45.350 --> 00:23:45.360 align:start position:0%
here but there were a couple of other
 
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:48.600 align:start position:0%
indicators uh in in the system that I
 
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:51.240 align:start position:0%
think we need to probably take a look
 
00:23:54.110 --> 00:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
at uh and I don't have I don't have a
 
00:23:55.630 --> 00:23:55.640 align:start position:0%
strong opinion about this yet because I
 
00:23:58.950 --> 00:23:58.960 align:start position:0%
just don't know enough about it but the
 
00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:02.600 align:start position:0%
national numbers um and refer to what's
 
00:24:05.269 --> 00:24:05.279 align:start position:0%
known as the recipiency rate and the
 
00:24:07.669 --> 00:24:07.679 align:start position:0%
recipiency rate is a number of people
 
00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:09.760 align:start position:0%
who are collecting benefits who are
 
00:24:11.630 --> 00:24:11.640 align:start position:0%
eligible to collect in relation to who
 
00:24:13.950 --> 00:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
is eligible to collect them and that
 
00:24:15.310 --> 00:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
number is fairly
 
00:24:18.149 --> 00:24:18.159 align:start position:0%
low uh we are behind the curve in terms
 
00:24:22.110 --> 00:24:22.120 align:start position:0%
of the federal government in 19 uh 200
 
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
22 we were at 11% and the federal rate
 
00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.630 align:start position:0%
22 we were at 11% and the federal rate
was

00:24:26.630 --> 00:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:24:30.549 --> 00:24:30.559 align:start position:0%
25% uh in 2023 was 177% the federal rate
 
00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:31.389 align:start position:0%
25% uh in 2023 was 177% the federal rate
was

00:24:31.389 --> 00:24:31.399 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:24:34.830 --> 00:24:34.840 align:start position:0%
29% so the question I have are people
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
just not filing for the benefits that
 
00:24:36.720 --> 00:24:38.110 align:start position:0%
just not filing for the benefits that
they're

00:24:38.110 --> 00:24:38.120 align:start position:0%
they're
 
00:24:42.510 --> 00:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
entitled uh secondly um I I think that
 
00:24:46.909 --> 00:24:46.919 align:start position:0%
we we might want to look at uh the work
 
00:24:49.269 --> 00:24:49.279 align:start position:0%
requirements and to see if in fact the
 
00:24:49.279 --> 00:24:50.190 align:start position:0%
requirements and to see if in fact the
work

00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
work
 
00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
requirements um are discouraging people
 
00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:54.760 align:start position:0%
from filing for
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment because it's tough to file
 
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:01.120 align:start position:0%
for unemployment and um and and to do
 
00:25:02.710 --> 00:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
what you need to do when you find for
 
00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment you got to be looking for
 
00:25:06.990 --> 00:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
work all the time now there are there
 
00:25:08.549 --> 00:25:08.559 align:start position:0%
are ways that you you know there are
 
00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
some Provisions in there the
 
00:25:11.510 --> 00:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
commissioner can look at the jobs but
 
00:25:14.430 --> 00:25:14.440 align:start position:0%
for the most part you got to be actively
 
00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
available and seeking work now I if
 
00:25:20.149 --> 00:25:20.159 align:start position:0%
you're in Berlin New Hampshire there's
 
00:25:22.430 --> 00:25:22.440 align:start position:0%
about 850 employees in Berlin New
 
00:25:24.269 --> 00:25:24.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire if you're in the southern part
 
00:25:25.789 --> 00:25:25.799 align:start position:0%
of the state and you're knocking outoors
 
00:25:28.149 --> 00:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
there's thousands of employers in the in
 
00:25:31.549 --> 00:25:31.559 align:start position:0%
the southern part of the state so this
 
00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't uh vary as best as I can
 
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
determine it's the same requirements are
 
00:25:37.830 --> 00:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
the same so how many times can you knock
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
on somebody's door in Berlin New
 
00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire looking for work um but that's
 
00:25:48.870 --> 00:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
that's and again um the Department's
 
00:25:51.430 --> 00:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
here you can you can ask them but the
 
00:25:53.350 --> 00:25:53.360 align:start position:0%
other thing that really is a little
 
00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:56.120 align:start position:0%
disturbing to me uh is this particular
 
00:25:58.269 --> 00:25:58.279 align:start position:0%
poster that appears in the uh
 
00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation quick
 
00:26:03.750 --> 00:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
tips and what this rep what this is is
 
00:26:07.190 --> 00:26:07.200 align:start position:0%
the picture of a person behind
 
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:11.120 align:start position:0%
bars welcome to the employment security
 
00:26:14.389 --> 00:26:14.399 align:start position:0%
system now there are people commit fraud
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
and that's a serious concern and the
 
00:26:19.710 --> 00:26:19.720 align:start position:0%
department has a robust system of
 
00:26:21.510 --> 00:26:21.520 align:start position:0%
enforcing the
 
00:26:26.230 --> 00:26:26.240 align:start position:0%
law but putting something like this into
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh an intro packet and may not be there
 
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:31.640 align:start position:0%
anymore um is a little discouraging
 
00:26:34.430 --> 00:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
would scare the heck out of me uh first
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
of all you got to go through the whole
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
system and if you make a mistake then
 
00:26:41.269 --> 00:26:41.279 align:start position:0%
potentially is this in net result that
 
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
this could happen you know that may be
 
00:26:46.549 --> 00:26:46.559 align:start position:0%
an exaggeration but clearly people there
 
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:50.080 align:start position:0%
are people who who take advantage of the
 
00:26:52.710 --> 00:26:52.720 align:start position:0%
system and they can go to jail for
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
that so I you know I think uh it's our
 
00:26:58.110 --> 00:26:58.120 align:start position:0%
job now clearly our job to figure this
 
00:26:59.830 --> 00:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
thing out it's not not another
 
00:27:02.029 --> 00:27:02.039 align:start position:0%
committee's job it's our job right now I
 
00:27:03.750 --> 00:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
think that we have enough information
 
00:27:05.029 --> 00:27:05.039 align:start position:0%
and we going to get more information
 
00:27:08.830 --> 00:27:08.840 align:start position:0%
from the Department about about this um
 
00:27:10.950 --> 00:27:10.960 align:start position:0%
but it's time I think after 17 years to
 
00:27:13.029 --> 00:27:13.039 align:start position:0%
do something to do something that
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
increases a benefit for workers and
 
00:27:17.549 --> 00:27:17.559 align:start position:0%
protects uh the workers in the state of
 
00:27:19.830 --> 00:27:19.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire in cases of economic
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
downturn 50,000 people nearly 50,000
 
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
people every day leave the state of New
 
00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to go to Massachusetts
 
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:30.240 align:start position:0%
it's a drain a brain drain in New
 
00:27:31.669 --> 00:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and these are not low-wage
 
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
workers these are high-tech uh workers
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
who are leaving the state you're going
 
00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
to hear from one of the uh speakers from
 
00:27:40.950 --> 00:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
the building trads uh and you make a
 
00:27:43.269 --> 00:27:43.279 align:start position:0%
comparison between what the difference
 
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
is in a building transect from going to
 
00:27:47.669 --> 00:27:47.679 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and getting unemployed and
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
working in New Hampshire and getting
 
00:27:51.310 --> 00:27:51.320 align:start position:0%
unemployed is a very different situation
 
00:27:54.430 --> 00:27:54.440 align:start position:0%
believe so uh I'll end with that we you
 
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:56.200 align:start position:0%
know the subcommittee we can certainly
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
deal with this again there were number
 
00:27:59.710 --> 00:27:59.720 align:start position:0%
of bills in front of the Senate that we
 
00:28:02.350 --> 00:28:02.360 align:start position:0%
may end up all getting together
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
on thank you Mr chairman I'm sorry that
 
00:28:07.630 --> 00:28:07.640 align:start position:0%
took so long lot of information no
 
00:28:09.389 --> 00:28:09.399 align:start position:0%
worries no worries that we have plenty
 
00:28:10.990 --> 00:28:11.000 align:start position:0%
of time for this hearing I knew would be
 
00:28:12.950 --> 00:28:12.960 align:start position:0%
a lot of discussion so no worries uh
 
00:28:15.509 --> 00:28:15.519 align:start position:0%
representative Schultz thank you Mr
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
chair um is there a consideration or an
 
00:28:22.590 --> 00:28:22.600 align:start position:0%
interest on your part to include
 
00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:25.440 align:start position:0%
um I'm not exactly sure how to put this
 
00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:27.200 align:start position:0%
getting rid of the sort of penalty that
 
00:28:30.110 --> 00:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
some some folks incur when they're
 
00:28:33.950 --> 00:28:33.960 align:start position:0%
unemployed that if they get short-term
 
00:28:36.310 --> 00:28:36.320 align:start position:0%
gigs and if it falls in the
 
00:28:39.389 --> 00:28:39.399 align:start position:0%
redetermination period it actually can
 
00:28:42.789 --> 00:28:42.799 align:start position:0%
mean a reduction in the unemployment
 
00:28:45.710 --> 00:28:45.720 align:start position:0%
rate when it's essentially becomes a
 
00:28:50.110 --> 00:28:50.120 align:start position:0%
penalty for um getting short-term gigs
 
00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:52.440 align:start position:0%
do you know does that makes do am I
 
00:28:55.750 --> 00:28:55.760 align:start position:0%
explaining that well enough I think that
 
00:28:59.310 --> 00:28:59.320 align:start position:0%
um you know looking at at things like
 
00:29:01.230 --> 00:29:01.240 align:start position:0%
this looking at the whole work
 
00:29:05.070 --> 00:29:05.080 align:start position:0%
requirement piece um it's going to take
 
00:29:08.669 --> 00:29:08.679 align:start position:0%
time to go through that uh but but I and
 
00:29:10.389 --> 00:29:10.399 align:start position:0%
I but I think we should do it at some
 
00:29:12.310 --> 00:29:12.320 align:start position:0%
point to see what barriers are there
 
00:29:15.590 --> 00:29:15.600 align:start position:0%
what happens to people for instance uh
 
00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:16.310 align:start position:0%
what happens to people for instance uh
the

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:29:18.549 --> 00:29:18.559 align:start position:0%
department in I think it was March of
 
00:29:22.149 --> 00:29:22.159 align:start position:0%
last year um put out a press release
 
00:29:23.710 --> 00:29:23.720 align:start position:0%
that they had
 
00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
overpaid uh thousands of people and it
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
was in the 90 some odd million dollar
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
range that they had overpaid
 
00:29:34.470 --> 00:29:34.480 align:start position:0%
people I don't know how that happened uh
 
00:29:36.029 --> 00:29:36.039 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they'll have an explanation for
 
00:29:38.990 --> 00:29:39.000 align:start position:0%
that but that what that meant is that
 
00:29:40.789 --> 00:29:40.799 align:start position:0%
thousands of people were overpaid and
 
00:29:42.630 --> 00:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
somebody had to claw that money back
 
00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:46.320 align:start position:0%
from people uh now did these people do
 
00:29:48.950 --> 00:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
this on purpose did they you know I
 
00:29:50.549 --> 00:29:50.559 align:start position:0%
would doubt it I think they could have
 
00:29:52.590 --> 00:29:52.600 align:start position:0%
made a mistake they could have you know
 
00:29:56.029 --> 00:29:56.039 align:start position:0%
misread the um misread the thing but the
 
00:29:57.149 --> 00:29:57.159 align:start position:0%
fact is that there were a whole lot of
 
00:29:58.870 --> 00:29:58.880 align:start position:0%
people people that were paid benefits
 
00:30:00.669 --> 00:30:00.679 align:start position:0%
they didn't belong and now they the
 
00:30:03.110 --> 00:30:03.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility to bring it back um I
 
00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
think th those are one of number
 
00:30:08.870 --> 00:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
examples representative Schultz U the
 
00:30:11.149 --> 00:30:11.159 align:start position:0%
next bill
 
00:30:14.669 --> 00:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
yeahor repres Sullivan's Bill 1597 is is
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
coming up to deal with that fantastic

00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
McKenzie thank you Mr chair and thanks
 
00:30:24.430 --> 00:30:24.440 align:start position:0%
for taking my question would this
 
00:30:25.750 --> 00:30:25.760 align:start position:0%
legislation be necessary if New
 
00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:27.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire used sound money that didn't
 
00:30:30.110 --> 00:30:30.120 align:start position:0%
inflate away over
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
time I don't know that was the question
 
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:35.600 align:start position:0%
would this go fade away if the state
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
used found
 
00:30:39.590 --> 00:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
money uh would this legislation be
 
00:30:41.470 --> 00:30:41.480 align:start position:0%
necessary if New Hampshire used sound
 
00:30:42.909 --> 00:30:42.919 align:start position:0%
money that didn't inflate away to
 
00:30:47.710 --> 00:30:47.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:50.960 align:start position:0%

Bureau of the Department of Employment
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
Security um so we had uh provided some
 
00:31:48.710 --> 00:31:48.720 align:start position:0%
material I think it was as
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie had referred to
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
is the pretty packet um that folks had
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
received so it's um some information
 
00:31:59.470 --> 00:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
that we feel is is relevant to the
 
00:32:02.629 --> 00:32:02.639 align:start position:0%
matter at hand and the consideration of
 
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:04.840 align:start position:0%
uh whether or not benefits should be
 
00:32:06.870 --> 00:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
increased so we have a quite a bit of
 
00:32:08.950 --> 00:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
information in there um but just before
 
00:32:10.830 --> 00:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
we start going through that there were a
 
00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:13.360 align:start position:0%
number of points um that representative
 
00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:15.760 align:start position:0%
McKenzie had raised um that aren't
 
00:32:17.430 --> 00:32:17.440 align:start position:0%
addressed in here that I felt important
 
00:32:20.190 --> 00:32:20.200 align:start position:0%
to quickly discuss and I think some of
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
them um he actually invited me to
 
00:32:25.509 --> 00:32:25.519 align:start position:0%
discuss um with bringing up the topics
 
00:32:27.830 --> 00:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
um regarding overpayments
 
00:32:31.269 --> 00:32:31.279 align:start position:0%
um so we've we had a significant amount
 
00:32:33.389 --> 00:32:33.399 align:start position:0%
of overpayments to the tune of over $100
 
00:32:36.389 --> 00:32:36.399 align:start position:0%
million during the pandemic almost all
 
00:32:38.950 --> 00:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
of that was Federal and almost all of it
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
was because the federal government kept
 
00:32:43.110 --> 00:32:43.120 align:start position:0%
on changing the rules for people that
 
00:32:46.149 --> 00:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
were filing during the pandemic and what
 
00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:50.200 align:start position:0%
they did was they required states that
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
when those rules changed and someone
 
00:32:55.509 --> 00:32:55.519 align:start position:0%
didn't meet the eligibility requirement
 
00:32:57.909 --> 00:32:57.919 align:start position:0%
they needed to be found overpaid
 
00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:00.240 align:start position:0%
however in most instances those
 
00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
individuals would not be required to pay
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
those benefits back they'd be what the
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
federal government refers to as waved
 
00:33:09.389 --> 00:33:09.399 align:start position:0%
benefits so we actually created a
 
00:33:11.230 --> 00:33:11.240 align:start position:0%
process on our website where individuals
 
00:33:12.990 --> 00:33:13.000 align:start position:0%
who were in that circumstance could go
 
00:33:15.509 --> 00:33:15.519 align:start position:0%
right on the website I think it was four
 
00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:18.200 align:start position:0%
clicks answer a few questions required
 
00:33:20.110 --> 00:33:20.120 align:start position:0%
by the federal government and those
 
00:33:22.389 --> 00:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
Federal overpayments would be forgiven
 
00:33:25.310 --> 00:33:25.320 align:start position:0%
with nothing repaid by them no impact on
 
00:33:27.350 --> 00:33:27.360 align:start position:0%
the state's trust fund cuz they were
 
00:33:30.230 --> 00:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
Federal benefits but for the most part
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
those were all federal benefits
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
individuals were not at fault and the
 
00:33:37.149 --> 00:33:37.159 align:start position:0%
rules were changing um and the rules
 
00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
were changing because the pandemic was
 
00:33:40.789 --> 00:33:40.799 align:start position:0%
changing I mean let's go back in time
 
00:33:42.789 --> 00:33:42.799 align:start position:0%
and remember how difficult that time
 
00:33:45.549 --> 00:33:45.559 align:start position:0%
period was um the department made an
 
00:33:47.070 --> 00:33:47.080 align:start position:0%
initial decision at the beginning of the
 
00:33:49.430 --> 00:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
pandemic to get the money out the door
 
00:33:51.669 --> 00:33:51.679 align:start position:0%
um because people needed it and in some
 
00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:54.360 align:start position:0%
instances the rules changed resulting in
 
00:33:56.389 --> 00:33:56.399 align:start position:0%
overpayments and the department did its
 
00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
best to try to inform individuals um and
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
then help them get those overpayments
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
forgiven following a simplified version
 
00:34:06.750 --> 00:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
of the federal rules so just to kind of
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
uh put that into context the most common
 
00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
reason for overpayments of state
 
00:34:15.629 --> 00:34:15.639 align:start position:0%
benefits is because of unreported
 
00:34:18.510 --> 00:34:18.520 align:start position:0%
earnings so the picture that
 
00:34:20.990 --> 00:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie had shown that
 
00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:25.240 align:start position:0%
is a page within the benefit rights
 
00:34:27.510 --> 00:34:27.520 align:start position:0%
handbook that individuals are seeing
 
00:34:29.430 --> 00:34:29.440 align:start position:0%
during the first 3 weeks of filing a
 
00:34:31.710 --> 00:34:31.720 align:start position:0%
claim they come into the department and
 
00:34:33.510 --> 00:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
they sit through what is usually about a
 
00:34:36.069 --> 00:34:36.079 align:start position:0%
60-minute presentation of all the dos
 
00:34:38.869 --> 00:34:38.879 align:start position:0%
and don'ts of filing for unemployment
 
00:34:41.510 --> 00:34:41.520 align:start position:0%
how you when you need to file what the
 
00:34:43.149 --> 00:34:43.159 align:start position:0%
weekly claim looks like what the
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
questions are asked what we need to be
 
00:34:47.589 --> 00:34:47.599 align:start position:0%
uh what you need to be telling us with
 
00:34:50.629 --> 00:34:50.639 align:start position:0%
regard to your work search efforts the
 
00:34:52.349 --> 00:34:52.359 align:start position:0%
earnings that you have from part-time
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
employment during those weeks so we
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
provide all of that information but we
 
00:34:57.910 --> 00:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
also spend spend a lot of time
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
explaining to people of unemployment
 
00:35:03.190 --> 00:35:03.200 align:start position:0%
fraud and the importance of reporting
 
00:35:05.829 --> 00:35:05.839 align:start position:0%
your earnings and we make sure they
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
understand the consequences of not
 
00:35:09.829 --> 00:35:09.839 align:start position:0%
reporting your earnings because it has a
 
00:35:11.829 --> 00:35:11.839 align:start position:0%
significant impact on the unemployment
 
00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
trust fund and we actually have a
 
00:35:14.950 --> 00:35:14.960 align:start position:0%
partnership with the New Hampshire
 
00:35:16.349 --> 00:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office where
 
00:35:19.069 --> 00:35:19.079 align:start position:0%
individuals who commit egregious
 
00:35:21.510 --> 00:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment fraud by not reporting
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
earnings from not just $100 here $100
 
00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
there I'm talking full time employment
 
00:35:31.750 --> 00:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
earnings not being not being reported to
 
00:35:34.310 --> 00:35:34.320 align:start position:0%
the department despite very clear and
 
00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.349 align:start position:0%
the department despite very clear and
simple

00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:35:38.710 --> 00:35:38.720 align:start position:0%
questions over the course of sometimes
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
10 20 30 weeks not
 
00:35:45.550 --> 00:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
reported why well it's certainly not
 
00:35:47.790 --> 00:35:47.800 align:start position:0%
because of the department not informing
 
00:35:50.150 --> 00:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
them of their obligations to report
 
00:35:52.750 --> 00:35:52.760 align:start position:0%
those earnings and when those situations
 
00:35:55.630 --> 00:35:55.640 align:start position:0%
are egregious we prosecute them through
 
00:35:57.069 --> 00:35:57.079 align:start position:0%
our partnership with theor Attorney
 
00:35:59.109 --> 00:35:59.119 align:start position:0%
General's office which has been in place
 
00:36:01.750 --> 00:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
since about 2015 and I think it's
 
00:36:04.349 --> 00:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
important that we do so because those
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
benefits need to be available for
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
individuals that are unemployed through
 
00:36:10.030 --> 00:36:10.040 align:start position:0%
no fault of their own and they are
 
00:36:12.150 --> 00:36:12.160 align:start position:0%
looking for employment not those
 
00:36:13.950 --> 00:36:13.960 align:start position:0%
individuals that might have had a
 
00:36:16.510 --> 00:36:16.520 align:start position:0%
qualifying separation but then find new
 
00:36:18.710 --> 00:36:18.720 align:start position:0%
employment and decide that it's in their
 
00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
best interest to continue to receive
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
their full unemployment benefit and not
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
report their new full-time employment
 
00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
earnings so unemployment fraud is real
 
00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:29.880 align:start position:0%
it's something we take very seriously as
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
you can see from the picture in the the
 
00:36:34.270 --> 00:36:34.280 align:start position:0%
benefit rights book which I make no
 
00:36:36.470 --> 00:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
apologies for including that I think
 
00:36:38.470 --> 00:36:38.480 align:start position:0%
it's important that we are very straight
 
00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:40.560 align:start position:0%
with individuals when they come in so
 
00:36:44.230 --> 00:36:44.240 align:start position:0%
that they understand what the what the
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
um penalties are that can result if they
 
00:36:49.910 --> 00:36:49.920 align:start position:0%
fail to report their earnings while
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
collecting unemployment benefits um with
 
00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:54.520 align:start position:0%
regard to
 
00:36:56.829 --> 00:36:56.839 align:start position:0%
solvency um representative McKenzie had
 
00:36:58.790 --> 00:36:58.800 align:start position:0%
had talked about trust fund solvency
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a great topic I think
 
00:37:02.430 --> 00:37:02.440 align:start position:0%
there's a handful of us in the state
 
00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:07.160 align:start position:0%
that um um spend time dealing with it um
 
00:37:09.190 --> 00:37:09.200 align:start position:0%
the federal government rates every state
 
00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:11.319 align:start position:0%
okay they they come out every year
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
usually in March they come out with
 
00:37:15.670 --> 00:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
their Federal um trust fund solvency
 
00:37:17.790 --> 00:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
report and I think um what it looked
 
00:37:19.390 --> 00:37:19.400 align:start position:0%
like representative McKenzie had shown
 
00:37:21.630 --> 00:37:21.640 align:start position:0%
was each state has a page um and they
 
00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:23.880 align:start position:0%
update that annually usually in March
 
00:37:25.589 --> 00:37:25.599 align:start position:0%
although I think last year they might
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
have um come out a little bit earlier in
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
February so there'll be a new report
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
coming out very soon um it'll have what
 
00:37:34.630 --> 00:37:34.640 align:start position:0%
they call an average high cost
 
00:37:38.550 --> 00:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
multiplier an ahcm um for each state and
 
00:37:40.150 --> 00:37:40.160 align:start position:0%
as representative McKenzie had indicated
 
00:37:43.510 --> 00:37:43.520 align:start position:0%
the goal for each state is to have an
 
00:37:45.309 --> 00:37:45.319 align:start position:0%
ahcm of
 
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
1.0 that is the federal government uh
 
00:37:50.829 --> 00:37:50.839 align:start position:0%
indicating that they feel that that
 
00:37:54.109 --> 00:37:54.119 align:start position:0%
State's trust fund is solvent the way
 
00:37:56.030 --> 00:37:56.040 align:start position:0%
they do that they look at total wages
 
00:37:58.030 --> 00:37:58.040 align:start position:0%
they look at total employment and they
 
00:38:00.430 --> 00:38:00.440 align:start position:0%
also look at your at your three biggest
 
00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:03.640 align:start position:0%
benefit payout years during the last 20
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
and that's how they rate to see whether
 
00:38:07.430 --> 00:38:07.440 align:start position:0%
or not your state can
 
00:38:10.349 --> 00:38:10.359 align:start position:0%
withstand an unknown storm coming with
 
00:38:13.190 --> 00:38:13.200 align:start position:0%
the next economic downturn so New
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when they last rated us we
 
00:38:16.550 --> 00:38:16.560 align:start position:0%
were just over
 
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
0.9% um we have since seen a a continued
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
increase in the balance of our trust
 
00:38:25.710 --> 00:38:25.720 align:start position:0%
fund we are up just below 400 million
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
right now we're about
 
00:38:30.990 --> 00:38:31.000 align:start position:0%
396 in that range um I suspect that when
 
00:38:33.309 --> 00:38:33.319 align:start position:0%
that new report comes out in the next
 
00:38:34.589 --> 00:38:34.599 align:start position:0%
couple of months it will have New
 
00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:38.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at that ahcm of 1.0 maybe a
 
00:38:41.069 --> 00:38:41.079 align:start position:0%
little bit above um and that would put
 
00:38:44.550 --> 00:38:44.560 align:start position:0%
us in probably with um less than two
 
00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
dozen states that actually achieve that
 
00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:48.680 align:start position:0%
Mark um so uh it's it's a point that New
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is proud of and we should um
 
00:38:53.829 --> 00:38:53.839 align:start position:0%
it should uh uh be we should be mindful
 
00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
that that means that whenever the next
 
00:38:58.790 --> 00:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
downturn turn hits that New Hampshire
 
00:39:00.829 --> 00:39:00.839 align:start position:0%
would be able to pay benefits to
 
00:39:02.990 --> 00:39:03.000 align:start position:0%
unemployed individuals in New Hampshire
 
00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:04.880 align:start position:0%
without having to rely upon the federal
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
government from taking action um and
 
00:39:09.430 --> 00:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
from providing uh that back stop if we
 
00:39:11.309 --> 00:39:11.319 align:start position:0%
were to run out run out of benefits so
 
00:39:13.109 --> 00:39:13.119 align:start position:0%
it's it's an important indicator it's
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
the trust fund solvency measure is very
 
00:39:18.349 --> 00:39:18.359 align:start position:0%
important um looking at the the
 
00:39:21.589 --> 00:39:21.599 align:start position:0%
recipiency rate um I don't know how
 
00:39:24.430 --> 00:39:24.440 align:start position:0%
useful recipiency rate is it is it it
 
00:39:26.510 --> 00:39:26.520 align:start position:0%
has a lot of individuals in there who
 
00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:28.240 align:start position:0%
didn't have enough earnings to qualify
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
for unemployment benefits um in New
 
00:39:32.109 --> 00:39:32.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you have to have at least
 
00:39:34.829 --> 00:39:34.839 align:start position:0%
$2,800 in earnings in your 4 quarter
 
00:39:36.710 --> 00:39:36.720 align:start position:0%
based period in order to be monetarily
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
eligible uh some people don't have that
 
00:39:41.109 --> 00:39:41.119 align:start position:0%
uncovered employment that influences
 
00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:43.359 align:start position:0%
that recipiency rate number probably a
 
00:39:46.150 --> 00:39:46.160 align:start position:0%
better measure is to look at our our uh
 
00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:48.760 align:start position:0%
rates at which we deny and allow
 
00:39:50.430 --> 00:39:50.440 align:start position:0%
benefits When individuals come in and
 
00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:52.960 align:start position:0%
file um in New Hampshire's at about a
 
00:39:56.069 --> 00:39:56.079 align:start position:0%
76% rate of allowing applications for
 
00:39:57.670 --> 00:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
benefit benefits When individuals come
 
00:40:00.069 --> 00:40:00.079 align:start position:0%
in right now that's probably a better
 
00:40:02.550 --> 00:40:02.560 align:start position:0%
indicator of what the what the program
 
00:40:05.230 --> 00:40:05.240 align:start position:0%
is doing um and then with regard to work
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
requirements yes um the federal
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
government requires each state to um
 
00:40:14.950 --> 00:40:14.960 align:start position:0%
confirm that individuals are able for
 
00:40:17.710 --> 00:40:17.720 align:start position:0%
able to work available to work and are
 
00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
conducting an adequate work search to
 
00:40:20.910 --> 00:40:20.920 align:start position:0%
demonstrate their attachment to the
 
00:40:22.870 --> 00:40:22.880 align:start position:0%
labor market and you have to do that
 
00:40:25.790 --> 00:40:25.800 align:start position:0%
each and every week because it is a
 
00:40:27.910 --> 00:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
matter of continued eligibility
 
00:40:30.270 --> 00:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
eligibility is determined from a week to
 
00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:33.040 align:start position:0%
week basis so New Hampshire is required
 
00:40:36.190 --> 00:40:36.200 align:start position:0%
by the federal government to ensure that
 
00:40:38.430 --> 00:40:38.440 align:start position:0%
that that we're meeting able available
 
00:40:40.950 --> 00:40:40.960 align:start position:0%
and labor force attachment now we do
 
00:40:42.910 --> 00:40:42.920 align:start position:0%
that on your on an individual's weekly
 
00:40:45.430 --> 00:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
claim they have a few screens on their
 
00:40:47.190 --> 00:40:47.200 align:start position:0%
on their weekly claim that asks what
 
00:40:49.069 --> 00:40:49.079 align:start position:0%
they did during the prior week for which
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
they are filing for unemployment
 
00:40:53.150 --> 00:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
benefits um one of those things they can
 
00:40:55.670 --> 00:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
do are contacting hiring employers we
 
00:40:58.750 --> 00:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
encourage that early in your claim
 
00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:00.800 align:start position:0%
though we understand there's a lot going
 
00:41:02.790 --> 00:41:02.800 align:start position:0%
on in an individual's life after that
 
00:41:05.069 --> 00:41:05.079 align:start position:0%
type of disruption so there's a lot of
 
00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.000 align:start position:0%
activities that individuals are allowed
 
00:41:10.230 --> 00:41:10.240 align:start position:0%
to participate in like uh utilizing some
 
00:41:12.790 --> 00:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
of our re-employment resources like
 
00:41:15.470 --> 00:41:15.480 align:start position:0%
upgrading your resume like upgrading
 
00:41:18.589 --> 00:41:18.599 align:start position:0%
your list of contacts in your network um
 
00:41:20.510 --> 00:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
so we have a lot of different activities
 
00:41:23.430 --> 00:41:23.440 align:start position:0%
individuals can participate in and be
 
00:41:25.309 --> 00:41:25.319 align:start position:0%
eligible for unemployment benefits
 
00:41:26.750 --> 00:41:26.760 align:start position:0%
particularly in those first first few
 
00:41:28.870 --> 00:41:28.880 align:start position:0%
weeks they can attend job fairs that the
 
00:41:30.790 --> 00:41:30.800 align:start position:0%
department puts on they can come in and
 
00:41:33.550 --> 00:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
utilize our job match system um either
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
at their home or in the department when
 
00:41:38.069 --> 00:41:38.079 align:start position:0%
you get later on in your claim we really
 
00:41:40.589 --> 00:41:40.599 align:start position:0%
focus on those employer contacts um
 
00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:43.240 align:start position:0%
because there at that point um where if
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
you're exceeding average duration
 
00:41:47.950 --> 00:41:47.960 align:start position:0%
something that you're doing is just not
 
00:41:49.829 --> 00:41:49.839 align:start position:0%
robust enough and we really want to see
 
00:41:51.910 --> 00:41:51.920 align:start position:0%
more employer contacts at that point in
 
00:41:53.910 --> 00:41:53.920 align:start position:0%
time um I think there's a probably a lot
 
00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:55.960 align:start position:0%
that we could do to strengthen that work
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
requ requirement um and I think right
 
00:42:01.510 --> 00:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
now um with the activities that
 
00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:03.480 align:start position:0%
individuals are are are able to
 
00:42:05.670 --> 00:42:05.680 align:start position:0%
participate in uh to demonstrate their
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
efforts to seek new employment um I
 
00:42:11.309 --> 00:42:11.319 align:start position:0%
think we try to strike a good balance of
 
00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
what we need to do to make sure that
 
00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.000 align:start position:0%
this partial temporary wage replacement
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
is as short as possible um because no
 
00:42:20.309 --> 00:42:20.319 align:start position:0%
one wants to stay on unemployment longer
 
00:42:21.670 --> 00:42:21.680 align:start position:0%
than they need to they want to get back
 
00:42:23.750 --> 00:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
to work and we try to help them to do
 
00:42:26.510 --> 00:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
that in the work requirement um the work
 
00:42:28.309 --> 00:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
search requirement that they that they
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
fill out as part of their weekly
 
00:42:32.829 --> 00:42:32.839 align:start position:0%
eligibility helps individuals do that um
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
so I'll um uh go back to what we were
 
00:42:37.230 --> 00:42:37.240 align:start position:0%
planning on discussing but I can
 
00:42:38.589 --> 00:42:38.599 align:start position:0%
certainly answer any questions with
 
00:42:40.470 --> 00:42:40.480 align:start position:0%
regard to any of those topics if folks
 
00:42:44.549 --> 00:42:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
those any questions about the previous
 
00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:49.200 align:start position:0%
comments if I would ask you just to hold
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
for one moment um part of the
 
00:42:54.710 --> 00:42:54.720 align:start position:0%
responsibility here of the uh labor
 
00:42:57.470 --> 00:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
committee uh is for one of the members
 
00:42:59.670 --> 00:42:59.680 align:start position:0%
to be part of the New Hampshire
 
00:43:01.589 --> 00:43:01.599 align:start position:0%
unemployment Securities Advisory Board
 
00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:03.040 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan has done that
 
00:43:04.390 --> 00:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
before I believe no you didn't when you
 
00:43:08.630 --> 00:43:08.640 align:start position:0%
were chairman uh I uh I currently serve
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
in that
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
position we meet quarterly and we go
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
over all the details of what's going on
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
with unemployment Securities uh how the
 
00:43:18.109 --> 00:43:18.119 align:start position:0%
trust funds doing how the expenses are
 
00:43:19.829 --> 00:43:19.839 align:start position:0%
going how the computer systems working
 
00:43:23.630 --> 00:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
all those things um and there's as a
 
00:43:25.589 --> 00:43:25.599 align:start position:0%
senator and myself as rep there's a
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
number of M members of business and
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
members of Labor we did meet on Monday
 
00:43:32.030 --> 00:43:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh it was our regular quarter quarterly
 
00:43:33.870 --> 00:43:33.880 align:start position:0%
meeting uh I was there representative
 
00:43:36.549 --> 00:43:36.559 align:start position:0%
mcken was also present um and we had
 
00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
this presentation um you know I've been
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
doing this for 14 years understanding
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
all this and it's difficult so please if
 
00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
if you're some of the things we're going
 
00:43:47.150 --> 00:43:47.160 align:start position:0%
through understanding how the
 
00:43:48.510 --> 00:43:48.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment Securities work it's not
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
very difficult but this is a lot of
 
00:43:51.670 --> 00:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
stuff and there's a lot of words and
 
00:43:53.710 --> 00:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
acronyms and things like that so at any
 
00:43:55.589 --> 00:43:55.599 align:start position:0%
time you have a question just just this
 
00:43:57.109 --> 00:43:57.119 align:start position:0%
presentation is going to take about 20
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
minutes of these these things here so
 
00:44:01.670 --> 00:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
feel free to ask questions because it's
 
00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720 align:start position:0%
going to be very important to how you
 
00:44:05.910 --> 00:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
make decisions of what we do with this
 
00:44:09.309 --> 00:44:09.319 align:start position:0%
bill and a couple others so um I know
 
00:44:10.390 --> 00:44:10.400 align:start position:0%
it's a lot it's going to be kind of a
 
00:44:11.829 --> 00:44:11.839 align:start position:0%
learning experience for some of the
 
00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
newer folks but um just want you to
 
00:44:18.390 --> 00:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
understand um how the how the kind of
 
00:44:20.349 --> 00:44:20.359 align:start position:0%
the system works behind the scenes and
 
00:44:22.109 --> 00:44:22.119 align:start position:0%
what you're going to see today uh and
 
00:44:23.390 --> 00:44:23.400 align:start position:0%
again representative McKenzie and I were
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
both in on the meeting we have seen this
 
00:44:29.510 --> 00:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
presentation and um um I'll I'll let it
 
00:44:33.230 --> 00:44:33.240 align:start position:0%
be there Mr C commissioner go ahead I
 
00:44:35.150 --> 00:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
just wanted to let everyone know who
 
00:44:37.710 --> 00:44:37.720 align:start position:0%
didn't know how how things kind of work
 
00:44:39.109 --> 00:44:39.119 align:start position:0%
great now everyone knows we didn't put
 
00:44:40.910 --> 00:44:40.920 align:start position:0%
this together specifically for them
 
00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:44.870 align:start position:0%
this together specifically for them
correct

00:44:44.870 --> 00:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:47.030 --> 00:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
represent um if you have a question
 
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
that's prohibiting you from thinking
 
00:44:49.870 --> 00:44:49.880 align:start position:0%
further on and what's going on you're
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
really confused I would like you to
 
00:44:53.270 --> 00:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
interrupt I'll see your hand and I will
 
00:44:55.549 --> 00:44:55.559 align:start position:0%
ask okay because chances are if you have
 
00:44:57.430 --> 00:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
a question on some of this as it's going
 
00:44:59.270 --> 00:44:59.280 align:start position:0%
through somebody else has the same
 
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
question all
 
00:45:04.150 --> 00:45:04.160 align:start position:0%
right all right I'll get us started and
 
00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:06.680 align:start position:0%
I I'll go um we'll you know just to
 
00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
clarify we'll we'll start here um and um
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
go through these pages and and uh
 
00:45:15.150 --> 00:45:15.160 align:start position:0%
director golob will jump in when we get
 
00:45:17.630 --> 00:45:17.640 align:start position:0%
to some of the forecasting uh that we've
 
00:45:19.950 --> 00:45:19.960 align:start position:0%
done to try to gauge the impact of
 
00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
what's been proposed by representative
 
00:45:25.270 --> 00:45:25.280 align:start position:0%
McKenzie so just to help level set for
 
00:45:27.910 --> 00:45:27.920 align:start position:0%
everyone and and uh what we feel to
 
00:45:29.790 --> 00:45:29.800 align:start position:0%
helpful to understand the impact of the
 
00:45:31.390 --> 00:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
bill as proposed is to understand the
 
00:45:34.309 --> 00:45:34.319 align:start position:0%
current system um so we just um provided
 
00:45:36.589 --> 00:45:36.599 align:start position:0%
some basic information there U to
 
00:45:37.829 --> 00:45:37.839 align:start position:0%
confirm some things you already heard
 
00:45:39.950 --> 00:45:39.960 align:start position:0%
from representative McKenzie U with our
 
00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:42.040 align:start position:0%
our current uh maximum weekly benefit
 
00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:43.440 align:start position:0%
amount is
 
00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:46.480 align:start position:0%
$427 a week uh that has been in place
 
00:45:46.480 --> 00:45:47.870 align:start position:0%
$427 a week uh that has been in place
since

00:45:47.870 --> 00:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
since
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
2007 um currently that weekly benefit is
 
00:45:53.710 --> 00:45:53.720 align:start position:0%
determined by how much a person earned
 
00:45:56.190 --> 00:45:56.200 align:start position:0%
in their four quarter base period so
 
00:45:58.349 --> 00:45:58.359 align:start position:0%
when you when you have a separation from
 
00:46:00.430 --> 00:46:00.440 align:start position:0%
employment uh you come in and we look at
 
00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:02.640 align:start position:0%
two things one we look to see that you
 
00:46:04.430 --> 00:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
had enough earnings in covered
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
employment in W2 employment with a New
 
00:46:08.309 --> 00:46:08.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employer uh you need to have
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
at least $2,800 in in earnings over that
 
00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:14.800 align:start position:0%
four quarter period 1,400 of which need
 
00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:16.280 align:start position:0%
to be and you need to have at least,
 
00:46:18.829 --> 00:46:18.839 align:start position:0%
1400 in two separate quarters in order
 
00:46:21.069 --> 00:46:21.079 align:start position:0%
to be what we refer to as monetarily
 
00:46:23.710 --> 00:46:23.720 align:start position:0%
eligible um now you need to also have a
 
00:46:25.510 --> 00:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
qualifying separation right you need to
 
00:46:27.750 --> 00:46:27.760 align:start position:0%
have a separation from from employment
 
00:46:29.790 --> 00:46:29.800 align:start position:0%
through no fault of your own so it's
 
00:46:32.309 --> 00:46:32.319 align:start position:0%
both of those issues we then look at the
 
00:46:34.630 --> 00:46:34.640 align:start position:0%
amount of of Base period earnings that
 
00:46:36.470 --> 00:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
you had so the earnings that you had in
 
00:46:38.829 --> 00:46:38.839 align:start position:0%
covered employment in your four quarters
 
00:46:41.309 --> 00:46:41.319 align:start position:0%
to determine what your weekly benefit
 
00:46:43.910 --> 00:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
amount is going to be so that maximum
 
00:46:45.549 --> 00:46:45.559 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:46:48.390 --> 00:46:48.400 align:start position:0%
$427 um requires that an individual had
 
00:46:49.589 --> 00:46:49.599 align:start position:0%
at least
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
$41,500 in annual earnings in their base
 
00:46:55.150 --> 00:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
period if you have more than that if you
 
00:46:56.510 --> 00:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
have $80,000
 
00:46:59.069 --> 00:46:59.079 align:start position:0%
in annual earnings your weekly benefit
 
00:47:01.990 --> 00:47:02.000 align:start position:0%
amount is still $427 that's the maximum
 
00:47:04.990 --> 00:47:05.000 align:start position:0%
amount available in New Hampshire um
 
00:47:08.230 --> 00:47:08.240 align:start position:0%
when um and we go all the way down to as
 
00:47:10.670 --> 00:47:10.680 align:start position:0%
I said to $2,800 that's the minimum
 
00:47:12.150 --> 00:47:12.160 align:start position:0%
amount of earnings in your base period
 
00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:14.040 align:start position:0%
to qualify for a weekly unemployment
 
00:47:17.349 --> 00:47:17.359 align:start position:0%
benefit and all the way up to 415 at the
 
00:47:20.470 --> 00:47:20.480 align:start position:0%
lower tiers at the lower tiers so at the
 
00:47:23.109 --> 00:47:23.119 align:start position:0%
the lower earnings that wage replacement
 
00:47:26.430 --> 00:47:26.440 align:start position:0%
rate or or how much um that unemployment
 
00:47:28.109 --> 00:47:28.119 align:start position:0%
benefit replaces of what you were
 
00:47:30.150 --> 00:47:30.160 align:start position:0%
earning when you were employed is in
 
00:47:33.470 --> 00:47:33.480 align:start position:0%
that 60% range um when you get to the
 
00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:36.280 align:start position:0%
higher tiers you're looking at more uh
 
00:47:39.870 --> 00:47:39.880 align:start position:0%
along the lines of a lower lower 50%
 
00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:43.680 align:start position:0%
wage replacement rate um and again um
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
the current benefit structure it was
 
00:47:49.430 --> 00:47:49.440 align:start position:0%
last revised in 2006 it went into effect
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
in July of ' 07 and the the change that
 
00:47:55.230 --> 00:47:55.240 align:start position:0%
was made at that time was to add five
 
00:47:58.510 --> 00:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
additional tiers so um prior to that
 
00:48:01.470 --> 00:48:01.480 align:start position:0%
change the maximum benefits went up to a
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
base period earning level of $36,500
 
00:48:08.270 --> 00:48:08.280 align:start position:0%
that change in 2007 brought in a new
 
00:48:12.190 --> 00:48:12.200 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount for 375 385
 
00:48:16.870 --> 00:48:16.880 align:start position:0%
39545 uh and 41,500 at 427 so that was
 
00:48:18.390 --> 00:48:18.400 align:start position:0%
the change that was done was to add
 
00:48:21.349 --> 00:48:21.359 align:start position:0%
those five additional tiers okay um oh
 
00:48:23.470 --> 00:48:23.480 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I'm want to interrupt a couple
 
00:48:25.190 --> 00:48:25.200 align:start position:0%
times does everyone understand rage
 
00:48:25.200 --> 00:48:26.190 align:start position:0%
times does everyone understand rage
replacement

00:48:26.190 --> 00:48:26.200 align:start position:0%
replacement
 
00:48:28.390 --> 00:48:28.400 align:start position:0%
percentage what you way have been making
 
00:48:29.829 --> 00:48:29.839 align:start position:0%
and what you're going to get as pay
 
00:48:33.710 --> 00:48:33.720 align:start position:0%
payment for weekly um and the tiers
 
00:48:35.549 --> 00:48:35.559 align:start position:0%
understand that it's based on how much
 
00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:36.880 align:start position:0%
you make and there's different tiers and
 
00:48:38.549 --> 00:48:38.559 align:start position:0%
you get more as you saw in
 
00:48:41.309 --> 00:48:41.319 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie's everyone got
 
00:48:46.470 --> 00:48:46.480 align:start position:0%
that what is the lowest $8 uh $32
 
00:48:50.230 --> 00:48:50.240 align:start position:0%
$32 so $32 is what the weekly benefit
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
amount is for someone that earned $2,800
 
00:48:54.589 --> 00:48:54.599 align:start position:0%
in their base
 
00:48:54.599 --> 00:48:56.309 align:start position:0%
in their base
period

00:48:56.309 --> 00:48:56.319 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:48:56.319 --> 00:48:58.589 align:start position:0%
period
everyone

00:48:58.589 --> 00:48:58.599 align:start position:0%
everyone
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
good um and looking just at a high level
 
00:49:04.829 --> 00:49:04.839 align:start position:0%
of what the proposal looks to do so it
 
00:49:07.150 --> 00:49:07.160 align:start position:0%
would uh increase the benefit the weekly
 
00:49:09.789 --> 00:49:09.799 align:start position:0%
benefit amount for the existing 52 tiers
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
that are in the statutory table um it
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
would it would add in two additional
 
00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:18.599 align:start position:0%
tiers to bring that to 54 um and then it
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
would add 19 tiers on top of that so um
 
00:49:26.789 --> 00:49:26.799 align:start position:0%
the 19 tiers would would be added onto
 
00:49:29.670 --> 00:49:29.680 align:start position:0%
that top tier right now of
 
00:49:31.710 --> 00:49:31.720 align:start position:0%
41,500 and they would go up in
 
00:49:35.870 --> 00:49:35.880 align:start position:0%
increments of a th000 um when I first
 
00:49:37.789 --> 00:49:37.799 align:start position:0%
looked at the proposal I had understood
 
00:49:39.990 --> 00:49:40.000 align:start position:0%
it to bring that level up to
 
00:49:43.390 --> 00:49:43.400 align:start position:0%
60,500 for a weekly benefit amount of
 
00:49:45.510 --> 00:49:45.520 align:start position:0%
753 representative McKenzie has
 
00:49:47.230 --> 00:49:47.240 align:start position:0%
clarified for me that his intent I
 
00:49:48.950 --> 00:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
believe is to it's a little bit less
 
00:49:51.150 --> 00:49:51.160 align:start position:0%
than that I think it's
 
00:49:54.510 --> 00:49:54.520 align:start position:0%
575 right so 575 but still the same
 
00:49:57.069 --> 00:49:57.079 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount so some of the the
 
00:49:59.030 --> 00:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
projection work that we do is not
 
00:50:01.630 --> 00:50:01.640 align:start position:0%
impacted by that but just um so you know
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
when you see if you see a reference to
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
6,500 that was uh the Department's uh
 
00:50:09.549 --> 00:50:09.559 align:start position:0%
confusion and the the top tier that the
 
00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:10.880 align:start position:0%
representative is looking to bring this
 
00:50:15.589 --> 00:50:15.599 align:start position:0%
to is 575 from the existing top tier of
 
00:50:19.109 --> 00:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
415 um so that the new maximum that's
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
proposed in the bill would be
 
00:50:24.230 --> 00:50:24.240 align:start position:0%
$753 uh doar a week that would be for
 
00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:28.040 align:start position:0%
someone that had at least $57,500 in
 
00:50:30.670 --> 00:50:30.680 align:start position:0%
annual earnings in their base period um
 
00:50:33.150 --> 00:50:33.160 align:start position:0%
the increases to the existing tiers so
 
00:50:36.270 --> 00:50:36.280 align:start position:0%
those 52 existing tiers the wage
 
00:50:38.349 --> 00:50:38.359 align:start position:0%
replacement rate would go up on the
 
00:50:40.230 --> 00:50:40.240 align:start position:0%
lower tiers to about
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
70% um right now we're about 60% so
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
those would go up to 70% and then the
 
00:50:48.430 --> 00:50:48.440 align:start position:0%
new benefit tiers those 19 new tiers
 
00:50:50.309 --> 00:50:50.319 align:start position:0%
those would be at a wage replacement
 
00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:52.839 align:start position:0%
rate of approximately 65% there's a few
 
00:50:54.150 --> 00:50:54.160 align:start position:0%
that are a little bit higher there's a
 
00:50:55.950 --> 00:50:55.960 align:start position:0%
few that are a little bit lower but
 
00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.230 align:start position:0%
few that are a little bit lower but
approximately

00:50:58.230 --> 00:50:58.240 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
00:51:02.309 --> 00:51:02.319 align:start position:0%
65% um now when we go to the next page
 
00:51:05.549 --> 00:51:05.559 align:start position:0%
and the the pages that follow um but
 
00:51:07.710 --> 00:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
we're trying to look at what the
 
00:51:10.630 --> 00:51:10.640 align:start position:0%
experience is of people that are filing
 
00:51:13.190 --> 00:51:13.200 align:start position:0%
for unemployment so we look at wage
 
00:51:16.750 --> 00:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
replacement Trends uh since uh 2007 when
 
00:51:19.390 --> 00:51:19.400 align:start position:0%
the last time the benefits were uh
 
00:51:21.430 --> 00:51:21.440 align:start position:0%
changed we look at the cost of living
 
00:51:23.870 --> 00:51:23.880 align:start position:0%
changes over that time period uh we look
 
00:51:26.230 --> 00:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
at average weekly benefit amount
 
00:51:28.630 --> 00:51:28.640 align:start position:0%
uh compared to other states we look at
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
exhaustion rates and duration so
 
00:51:32.870 --> 00:51:32.880 align:start position:0%
exhaustion rate is when you know how
 
00:51:35.109 --> 00:51:35.119 align:start position:0%
many people utilize all 26 weeks of
 
00:51:37.349 --> 00:51:37.359 align:start position:0%
their unemployment benefit and then
 
00:51:39.990 --> 00:51:40.000 align:start position:0%
duration is how many weeks on average do
 
00:51:42.390 --> 00:51:42.400 align:start position:0%
people actually file for they have 26
 
00:51:43.910 --> 00:51:43.920 align:start position:0%
available to them but how many do they
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
actually file for right now so um when
 
00:51:50.510 --> 00:51:50.520 align:start position:0%
we flip to the next uh page we get into
 
00:51:53.030 --> 00:51:53.040 align:start position:0%
uh charts that are more interesting um
 
00:51:55.470 --> 00:51:55.480 align:start position:0%
than just listen to me speak to words um
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
but what you can see is that the average
 
00:52:02.430 --> 00:52:02.440 align:start position:0%
private sector weekly wage compared to
 
00:52:04.789 --> 00:52:04.799 align:start position:0%
the maximum weekly unemployment benefit
 
00:52:08.309 --> 00:52:08.319 align:start position:0%
so 2007 that private sector average
 
00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
weekly wage was right at 852 this is
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
based upon the administrative filings
 
00:52:16.430 --> 00:52:16.440 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire employers um and at
 
00:52:18.910 --> 00:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
the time uh that was the new Max was was
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
increased to 427 uh so about a 50% wage
 
00:52:24.829 --> 00:52:24.839 align:start position:0%
replacement rate for the average private
 
00:52:27.030 --> 00:52:27.040 align:start position:0%
sector work worker at that point in time
 
00:52:31.630 --> 00:52:31.640 align:start position:0%
we fast forward to uh uh 2022 uh for the
 
00:52:34.030 --> 00:52:34.040 align:start position:0%
annual average the annual average
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
private sector weekly um uh wage was
 
00:52:40.870 --> 00:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:43.789 --> 00:52:43.799 align:start position:0%
$1,423 um still the maximum weekly
 
00:52:47.430 --> 00:52:47.440 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit at 427 so about a
 
00:52:50.549 --> 00:52:50.559 align:start position:0%
30% wage replacement rate so you can see
 
00:52:54.150 --> 00:52:54.160 align:start position:0%
that that 427 uh lost some power over
 
00:52:56.150 --> 00:52:56.160 align:start position:0%
the course of that time period with the
 
00:52:58.030 --> 00:52:58.040 align:start position:0%
increases in the average private sector
 
00:52:59.990 --> 00:53:00.000 align:start position:0%
weekly wage and then we also we did
 
00:53:02.030 --> 00:53:02.040 align:start position:0%
include the most recent quarter for
 
00:53:03.990 --> 00:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
which we have this data available in the
 
00:53:06.470 --> 00:53:06.480 align:start position:0%
third quarter of 23 um you can see that
 
00:53:08.109 --> 00:53:08.119 align:start position:0%
average weekly wage is about the same as
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
what it was for the um uh annual average
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
in 22 um and still about that 30% wage
 
00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640 align:start position:0%
replacement rate um when we flip uh to
 
00:53:21.230 --> 00:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
the next uh set of charts we look at the
 
00:53:24.309 --> 00:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
Consumer Price Index for the Northeast
 
00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
so um you can see here um in the in the
 
00:53:30.390 --> 00:53:30.400 align:start position:0%
top chart that Northeast CPI over the
 
00:53:33.750 --> 00:53:33.760 align:start position:0%
course of 2007 through
 
00:53:37.510 --> 00:53:37.520 align:start position:0%
2023 has increased just under 40% so
 
00:53:39.510 --> 00:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
that's looking at the cost of that
 
00:53:42.430 --> 00:53:42.440 align:start position:0%
basket of goods and what that costs uh
 
00:53:44.910 --> 00:53:44.920 align:start position:0%
for consumers in the Northeast so that's
 
00:53:44.920 --> 00:53:46.069 align:start position:0%
for consumers in the Northeast so that's
a

00:53:46.069 --> 00:53:46.079 align:start position:0%
a
 
00:53:49.510 --> 00:53:49.520 align:start position:0%
38.7% increase over that time period yes
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman a good question was asked
 
00:53:55.349 --> 00:53:55.359 align:start position:0%
and and I I I kind of gave my clerk an
 
00:53:57.430 --> 00:53:57.440 align:start position:0%
answer but I'd like to
 
00:53:59.870 --> 00:53:59.880 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think it's a good question and
 
00:54:02.630 --> 00:54:02.640 align:start position:0%
something people should know you the
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
blue graphs on the left side it says are
 
00:54:09.950 --> 00:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
the private sector weekly wage what
 
00:54:12.789 --> 00:54:12.799 align:start position:0%
about the non-profit sector or even
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
government sector why why is it
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
specifically for that does that mean the
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
state doesn't play pay we've had layoffs
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
any you know does the state not pay into
 
00:54:23.910 --> 00:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
the system like as an
 
00:54:26.109 --> 00:54:26.119 align:start position:0%
employer um
 
00:54:30.270 --> 00:54:30.280 align:start position:0%
a bunch of questions there um but no it
 
00:54:32.990 --> 00:54:33.000 align:start position:0%
was it was just my choice to to include
 
00:54:34.829 --> 00:54:34.839 align:start position:0%
the private sector rather than including
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
private plus plus Public public sector W
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
wages do bring that average um that blue
 
00:54:43.549 --> 00:54:43.559 align:start position:0%
chart down a little bit I believe we're
 
00:54:45.510 --> 00:54:45.520 align:start position:0%
down and when you bring in government
 
00:54:47.829 --> 00:54:47.839 align:start position:0%
you're down in the $1,300 range I'll
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
look to uh director golob to confirm
 
00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:51.480 align:start position:0%
whether that's close to being accurate
 
00:54:53.470 --> 00:54:53.480 align:start position:0%
yeah and and by the way private sector
 
00:54:55.589 --> 00:54:55.599 align:start position:0%
includes not for-profit it's we're not
 
00:54:56.950 --> 00:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
it's not a distinction between
 
00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
for-profit not for profit it's
 
00:55:01.990 --> 00:55:02.000 align:start position:0%
government versus any organization
 
00:55:05.470 --> 00:55:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's not a government I uh Mr L I was
 
00:55:07.750 --> 00:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
um it was under my impression that
 
00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:10.200 align:start position:0%
government such as Municipal and state
 
00:55:12.829 --> 00:55:12.839 align:start position:0%
government they do not pay the taxes
 
00:55:14.630 --> 00:55:14.640 align:start position:0%
they do get unemployment benefits but
 
00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:17.400 align:start position:0%
then they have to pay those back y yeah
 
00:55:20.990 --> 00:55:21.000 align:start position:0%
so um real quick so the state as an
 
00:55:24.230 --> 00:55:24.240 align:start position:0%
employer is a reimbursal so private
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
sector employ employers are required to
 
00:55:28.990 --> 00:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
be taxpaying employers that means that
 
00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:30.480 align:start position:0%
they have to pay at their
 
00:55:33.710 --> 00:55:33.720 align:start position:0%
experience-based rate on the first
 
00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:36.680 align:start position:0%
$14,000 in annual wages to each employee
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
and they pay that quarterly that's a tax
 
00:55:43.190 --> 00:55:43.200 align:start position:0%
they pay quarterly um state government
 
00:55:45.230 --> 00:55:45.240 align:start position:0%
they have to file a quarterly report but
 
00:55:47.589 --> 00:55:47.599 align:start position:0%
they don't pay quarterly tax what they
 
00:55:49.589 --> 00:55:49.599 align:start position:0%
do is they reimburse for the benefits
 
00:55:52.190 --> 00:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
that are paid out so when a state
 
00:55:54.589 --> 00:55:54.599 align:start position:0%
government employee is laid off or is
 
00:55:55.910 --> 00:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
unemployed employed through no fault of
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
their own the state then reimburses the
 
00:56:01.510 --> 00:56:01.520 align:start position:0%
fund dollar for dooll um for the for the
 
00:56:02.990 --> 00:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
benefits that are paid out for that
 
00:56:06.470 --> 00:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
individual similar for County um County
 
00:56:08.910 --> 00:56:08.920 align:start position:0%
government as an employer and municipal
 
00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
government as an employer the only
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
difference between the state and County
 
00:56:17.230 --> 00:56:17.240 align:start position:0%
and municipal government as employers is
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
that the state is required to be a
 
00:56:22.190 --> 00:56:22.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursal they can't change that County
 
00:56:25.109 --> 00:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
and municipal government can elect to be
 
00:56:27.549 --> 00:56:27.559 align:start position:0%
treated as a taxpaying employer the
 
00:56:30.270 --> 00:56:30.280 align:start position:0%
default is that they are a reimbursal
 
00:56:33.029 --> 00:56:33.039 align:start position:0%
what that means is that about 90% of
 
00:56:35.670 --> 00:56:35.680 align:start position:0%
Municipal and County employers elect to
 
00:56:38.190 --> 00:56:38.200 align:start position:0%
stay as reimbursing employers they don't
 
00:56:40.710 --> 00:56:40.720 align:start position:0%
have much in terms of layoff activity um
 
00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
so it makes sense that they're not
 
00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
paying quarterly tax um but others have
 
00:56:46.829 --> 00:56:46.839 align:start position:0%
decided that it's more advantageous for
 
00:56:49.190 --> 00:56:49.200 align:start position:0%
them to be a taxpaying employer rather
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
than a reimbursal so that's in a
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
nutshell how it works uh not for-profits
 
00:56:55.470 --> 00:56:55.480 align:start position:0%
have that same choice that they can make
 
00:56:58.750 --> 00:56:58.760 align:start position:0%
that election as well so a a nonprofit
 
00:57:01.990 --> 00:57:02.000 align:start position:0%
can can uh they are the default is as a
 
00:57:04.309 --> 00:57:04.319 align:start position:0%
reimbursal and they can elect to be a
 
00:57:06.829 --> 00:57:06.839 align:start position:0%
taxpaying employer like a a private
 
00:57:10.549 --> 00:57:10.559 align:start position:0%
sector for-profit employer if they so
 
00:57:14.430 --> 00:57:14.440 align:start position:0%
choose good question all right thank you
 
00:57:17.670 --> 00:57:17.680 align:start position:0%
continue oh represent brudy thank you Mr
 
00:57:19.950 --> 00:57:19.960 align:start position:0%
chairman what if a
 
00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
nonprofit um starts laying people off
 
00:57:25.950 --> 00:57:25.960 align:start position:0%
and then they dissolve
 
00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
and there's no money to
 
00:57:31.309 --> 00:57:31.319 align:start position:0%
reimburse um so that hand yeah so you
 
00:57:32.470 --> 00:57:32.480 align:start position:0%
you bring up a very good point
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
representative and that has been an
 
00:57:37.870 --> 00:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
issue over over the entire time I've
 
00:57:39.510 --> 00:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
been with the department and well before
 
00:57:41.430 --> 00:57:41.440 align:start position:0%
that that you have a nonprofit
 
00:57:43.589 --> 00:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
institution that that for whatever
 
00:57:47.309 --> 00:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
reason um closes down and when are those
 
00:57:49.670 --> 00:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
benefit Charges going to hit after they
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
close down right um so it becomes
 
00:57:55.190 --> 00:57:55.200 align:start position:0%
difficult for the Department to recoup
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
those uh the the reimbursement for those
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
benefits in some situations um what the
 
00:58:03.190 --> 00:58:03.200 align:start position:0%
department has done over the years to
 
00:58:05.589 --> 00:58:05.599 align:start position:0%
try to protect the trust fund is that
 
00:58:08.309 --> 00:58:08.319 align:start position:0%
when that is occurring the department
 
00:58:10.150 --> 00:58:10.160 align:start position:0%
does have the ability to put leans on
 
00:58:12.750 --> 00:58:12.760 align:start position:0%
real estate um other collection measures
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
that they can take uh um on an emergency
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
basis to try to protect the the state's
 
00:58:20.349 --> 00:58:20.359 align:start position:0%
interest in making sure that those
 
00:58:21.789 --> 00:58:21.799 align:start position:0%
benefit payments while we want to make
 
00:58:22.910 --> 00:58:22.920 align:start position:0%
them we want to make sure we're
 
00:58:24.750 --> 00:58:24.760 align:start position:0%
supporting those individuals that are on
 
00:58:27.829 --> 00:58:27.839 align:start position:0%
employed um but that it's not creating a
 
00:58:29.589 --> 00:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
disproportionate burden to the trust
 
00:58:33.270 --> 00:58:33.280 align:start position:0%
fund so that's we you know that's a a I
 
00:58:34.829 --> 00:58:34.839 align:start position:0%
would welcome that conversation in
 
00:58:36.910 --> 00:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
another day on ways that we could
 
00:58:39.510 --> 00:58:39.520 align:start position:0%
perhaps improve that uh situation but uh
 
00:58:41.230 --> 00:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
that's in a nutshell how we handle it
 
00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:43.349 align:start position:0%
that's in a nutshell how we handle it
right

00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:58:46.029 --> 00:58:46.039 align:start position:0%
now um just to to close up on the on the
 
00:58:47.630 --> 00:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
CPI portion of this you'll see in the
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
bottom chart it just shows the annual uh
 
00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:53.200 align:start position:0%
the the annual change um and U you can
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
see that big change obviously in in 2022
 
00:58:57.309 --> 00:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
with the inflation that we all
 
00:59:00.230 --> 00:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
experienced um which has has calmed down
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
um doesn't feel quite like it's calmed
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
down all that much um in terms of what
 
00:59:06.190 --> 00:59:06.200 align:start position:0%
we're paying but you can see it down the
 
00:59:08.829 --> 00:59:08.839 align:start position:0%
23 annual average was 3 and a half% so
 
00:59:12.470 --> 00:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
half of what we experienced in 22 um
 
00:59:15.630 --> 00:59:15.640 align:start position:0%
moving uh to the next topic when we flip
 
00:59:19.230 --> 00:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
to the next set of charts um here we're
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
looking at average weekly benefit
 
00:59:25.349 --> 00:59:25.359 align:start position:0%
amounts so before we were talking about
 
00:59:28.029 --> 00:59:28.039 align:start position:0%
um what the weekly benefit amount that
 
00:59:30.589 --> 00:59:30.599 align:start position:0%
is connected to the amount of annual
 
00:59:34.150 --> 00:59:34.160 align:start position:0%
earnings that someone has um and uh how
 
00:59:36.870 --> 00:59:36.880 align:start position:0%
much of those wages are being replaced
 
00:59:38.589 --> 00:59:38.599 align:start position:0%
with that weekly benefit amount with the
 
00:59:41.870 --> 00:59:41.880 align:start position:0%
max being 427 this chart shows what the
 
00:59:44.190 --> 00:59:44.200 align:start position:0%
average weekly benefit amount is for all
 
00:59:46.630 --> 00:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
of those people filing for benefits um
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
and we compare it against other states
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
so you can you can put it into context
 
00:59:52.829 --> 00:59:52.839 align:start position:0%
so you can see here New Hampshire's
 
00:59:55.670 --> 00:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
average weekly benefit amount is about
 
01:00:00.230 --> 01:00:00.240 align:start position:0%
$353 so the max is $427 the low is 32
 
01:00:02.150 --> 01:00:02.160 align:start position:0%
but that average is
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
$353 per week um it's about $80 lower
 
01:00:09.230 --> 01:00:09.240 align:start position:0%
than the US average uh us average is
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
about $433 and then you can see some
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
other northeast states on that top chart
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
with Massachusetts to the far right
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
having the highest um average weekly
 
01:00:21.670 --> 01:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
benefit amount at
 
01:00:23.670 --> 01:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
$681 uh compared to those other
 
01:00:25.910 --> 01:00:25.920 align:start position:0%
northeast states the bottom chart is a
 
01:00:29.910 --> 01:00:29.920 align:start position:0%
little bit uh uh of a u brain hurder
 
01:00:31.910 --> 01:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
right we have a lot of information here
 
01:00:34.230 --> 01:00:34.240 align:start position:0%
tried to include the weekly benefit
 
01:00:36.510 --> 01:00:36.520 align:start position:0%
amounts for for some select States so
 
01:00:39.150 --> 01:00:39.160 align:start position:0%
you can see um where New Hampshire falls
 
01:00:40.150 --> 01:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
but that
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
353 uh puts us to the left of the middle
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
of that chart uh right in between
 
01:00:48.109 --> 01:00:48.119 align:start position:0%
Michigan and California um and you can
 
01:00:50.470 --> 01:00:50.480 align:start position:0%
see Massachusetts again over on that far
 
01:00:54.710 --> 01:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
right at a 681 average uh weekly benefit
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
amount again and again this is the
 
01:00:58.750 --> 01:00:58.760 align:start position:0%
average weekly unemployment benefit
 
01:01:01.430 --> 01:01:01.440 align:start position:0%
payment that is that is paid out have a
 
01:01:06.029 --> 01:01:06.039 align:start position:0%
question Sol thank you
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
um how much we're obviously lower than
 
01:01:12.430 --> 01:01:12.440 align:start position:0%
average um and but I'm curious if that's
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
due to the fact that our maximum benefit
 
01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:18.160 align:start position:0%
is so low or is it because the um the
 
01:01:20.309 --> 01:01:20.319 align:start position:0%
benefits below the maximum are also
 
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
lower than
 
01:01:24.789 --> 01:01:24.799 align:start position:0%
normal um so a very good question um
 
01:01:28.670 --> 01:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
what you'll see is that um we actually
 
01:01:30.829 --> 01:01:30.839 align:start position:0%
have some um data here to show the
 
01:01:34.150 --> 01:01:34.160 align:start position:0%
actual experience from claim filers in
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
2023 and you'll see that a significant
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
number of those claim filers are getting
 
01:01:43.309 --> 01:01:43.319 align:start position:0%
grouped in the 427 Max weekly benefit
 
01:01:45.150 --> 01:01:45.160 align:start position:0%
amount because their earnings are are
 
01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:49.760 align:start position:0%
well above uh 41,5 so that that 353 is
 
01:01:51.829 --> 01:01:51.839 align:start position:0%
is depressed by the fact that our
 
01:01:55.470 --> 01:01:55.480 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit is is lower
 
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
I I have a question I didn't know if you
 
01:01:58.870 --> 01:01:58.880 align:start position:0%
had an opportunity I I brought this up
 
01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:01.160 align:start position:0%
at The Advisory Board committee one of
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
the things it's difficult to understand
 
01:02:04.870 --> 01:02:04.880 align:start position:0%
by looking at this if you just look at
 
01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:07.319 align:start position:0%
the the chart that shows New Hampshire
 
01:02:10.549 --> 01:02:10.559 align:start position:0%
being the lowest here
 
01:02:13.829 --> 01:02:13.839 align:start position:0%
um are all these are all the other New
 
01:02:16.510 --> 01:02:16.520 align:start position:0%
England states taxing the same amount of
 
01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:19.880 align:start position:0%
wages are is this 14,000 per employee
 
01:02:23.670 --> 01:02:23.680 align:start position:0%
are they all consistent or higher lower
 
01:02:26.990 --> 01:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
um they are not consistent so um and we
 
01:02:29.150 --> 01:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
have some charts that try to equalize
 
01:02:32.510 --> 01:02:32.520 align:start position:0%
this across States so each state has a
 
01:02:34.829 --> 01:02:34.839 align:start position:0%
slightly different mechanism for for how
 
01:02:37.309 --> 01:02:37.319 align:start position:0%
they set rates for purposes of
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation taxes how they
 
01:02:42.470 --> 01:02:42.480 align:start position:0%
um they how they experience rate the
 
01:02:44.870 --> 01:02:44.880 align:start position:0%
Employers in that state they have
 
01:02:47.309 --> 01:02:47.319 align:start position:0%
slightly different taxable wage bases so
 
01:02:49.510 --> 01:02:49.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's taxable wage base is
 
01:02:52.870 --> 01:02:52.880 align:start position:0%
$144,000 per employee per year and
 
01:02:55.069 --> 01:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
whatever your rate is is your experience
 
01:02:58.349 --> 01:02:58.359 align:start position:0%
based rate and for a new employer that's
 
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
2.7% uh you're paying that on that first
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
14,000 per employee per year we have
 
01:03:06.829 --> 01:03:06.839 align:start position:0%
some charts that look at some um trying
 
01:03:09.029 --> 01:03:09.039 align:start position:0%
to compare Apples to Apples by looking
 
01:03:12.190 --> 01:03:12.200 align:start position:0%
at total unemployment taxes paid by
 
01:03:14.710 --> 01:03:14.720 align:start position:0%
Employers in each state compared against
 
01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
total wages paid in each state and
 
01:03:19.470 --> 01:03:19.480 align:start position:0%
you'll see from lows where New Hampshire
 
01:03:23.910 --> 01:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
falls um we can we can provide um a a
 
01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:24.829 align:start position:0%
falls um we can we can provide um a a
chart

01:03:24.829 --> 01:03:24.839 align:start position:0%
chart
 
01:03:27.390 --> 01:03:27.400 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman that shows the the taxable
 
01:03:30.470 --> 01:03:30.480 align:start position:0%
wage base uh for each state the only
 
01:03:33.150 --> 01:03:33.160 align:start position:0%
caveat I would have there is that the
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
the way that the the rates are set in
 
01:03:38.789 --> 01:03:38.799 align:start position:0%
each state is slightly different so just
 
01:03:40.430 --> 01:03:40.440 align:start position:0%
because a State might have a taxable
 
01:03:43.029 --> 01:03:43.039 align:start position:0%
wage base of um
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
$40,000 if their the rate at which
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
they're setting is much lower than the
 
01:03:49.829 --> 01:03:49.839 align:start position:0%
mechanism in New Hampshire um it doesn't
 
01:03:52.710 --> 01:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
give you a it's not a clear picture that
 
01:03:54.549 --> 01:03:54.559 align:start position:0%
just because that taxable wage base is
 
01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
that much higher that the overall amount
 
01:03:57.990 --> 01:03:58.000 align:start position:0%
being paid is going to be higher you
 
01:03:59.589 --> 01:03:59.599 align:start position:0%
don't have to answer this now but when I
 
01:04:00.990 --> 01:04:01.000 align:start position:0%
look at a chart like this and I have an
 
01:04:03.990 --> 01:04:04.000 align:start position:0%
outlier I like to understand why is it
 
01:04:05.190 --> 01:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
just that Massachusetts pay
 
01:04:07.870 --> 01:04:07.880 align:start position:0%
significantly more or is it based on the
 
01:04:09.349 --> 01:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
amount that the people pay the employers
 
01:04:10.950 --> 01:04:10.960 align:start position:0%
pay in and all those different things
 
01:04:12.470 --> 01:04:12.480 align:start position:0%
but that that's a discussion for a
 
01:04:13.630 --> 01:04:13.640 align:start position:0%
different day but yeah and you and
 
01:04:15.150 --> 01:04:15.160 align:start position:0%
you'll see when we get into looking at
 
01:04:18.150 --> 01:04:18.160 align:start position:0%
some of the the um maximum weekly
 
01:04:19.990 --> 01:04:20.000 align:start position:0%
benefit amounts available by state
 
01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:21.720 align:start position:0%
you'll see where New Hampshire falls but
 
01:04:23.670 --> 01:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
here looking at average weekly benefit
 
01:04:25.230 --> 01:04:25.240 align:start position:0%
amount new Hampshire is low in the
 
01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:27.160 align:start position:0%
Northeast um but when you look in the
 
01:04:30.430 --> 01:04:30.440 align:start position:0%
National context um you know it it's um
 
01:04:33.710 --> 01:04:33.720 align:start position:0%
we're 19th lowest um in the country so
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
trying to put it in the context of where
 
01:04:38.470 --> 01:04:38.480 align:start position:0%
we sit um and also uh the country as a
 
01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
whole thank you um when we flip to the
 
01:04:44.910 --> 01:04:44.920 align:start position:0%
next uh charts we look at exhaustion
 
01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:49.279 align:start position:0%
rates and duration so um obviously the
 
01:04:51.150 --> 01:04:51.160 align:start position:0%
amount of unemployment benefits being
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
paid and the overall condition of the
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
state's economy have an impact on how
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
many people are exhausting their
 
01:04:59.710 --> 01:04:59.720 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits uh meaning that
 
01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:01.839 align:start position:0%
they file for all 26 weeks that are
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
available for them uh New Hampshire has
 
01:05:07.349 --> 01:05:07.359 align:start position:0%
a very low exhaustion rate um and
 
01:05:09.390 --> 01:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
continues to have the lowest exhaustion
 
01:05:12.109 --> 01:05:12.119 align:start position:0%
rate in the country so on the on the top
 
01:05:14.430 --> 01:05:14.440 align:start position:0%
chart you can see New Hampshire at 11%
 
01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:19.720 align:start position:0%
so 11% of filers utilize all 26 weeks um
 
01:05:21.950 --> 01:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
how that Stacks up against some other
 
01:05:24.950 --> 01:05:24.960 align:start position:0%
states um in that um across the country
 
01:05:27.430 --> 01:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
and then the chart below that includes
 
01:05:29.950 --> 01:05:29.960 align:start position:0%
all of the states but New Hampshire has
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
historically had one of the lowest
 
01:05:33.190 --> 01:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
exhaustion rates in the country and
 
01:05:36.309 --> 01:05:36.319 align:start position:0%
right now has the lowest um exhaustion
 
01:05:39.230 --> 01:05:39.240 align:start position:0%
rate in the country um looking at
 
01:05:43.190 --> 01:05:43.200 align:start position:0%
average duration so the number of weeks
 
01:05:45.549 --> 01:05:45.559 align:start position:0%
um that a person collects unemployment
 
01:05:47.109 --> 01:05:47.119 align:start position:0%
benefits in New Hampshire compared to
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
other states so again you have 26 weeks
 
01:05:52.589 --> 01:05:52.599 align:start position:0%
available um but right now as you'll see
 
01:05:54.789 --> 01:05:54.799 align:start position:0%
in that top chart New Hampshire's
 
01:05:59.190 --> 01:05:59.200 align:start position:0%
average duration is 10 weeks so 26
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
available average filer is filing for 10
 
01:06:06.630 --> 01:06:06.640 align:start position:0%
weeks um and that puts uh New Hampshire
 
01:06:09.309 --> 01:06:09.319 align:start position:0%
as having the lowest duration in the
 
01:06:11.230 --> 01:06:11.240 align:start position:0%
Northeast um and then in the bottom
 
01:06:13.349 --> 01:06:13.359 align:start position:0%
chart you can see that that puts us in
 
01:06:15.950 --> 01:06:15.960 align:start position:0%
as having the ninth lowest average
 
01:06:18.349 --> 01:06:18.359 align:start position:0%
duration in the entire country and you
 
01:06:19.829 --> 01:06:19.839 align:start position:0%
can see where some of the other states
 
01:06:22.990 --> 01:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
fall um in terms of that
 
01:06:26.829 --> 01:06:26.839 align:start position:0%
duration um when we flip to the next uh
 
01:06:29.029 --> 01:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
set of charts and this is getting to uh
 
01:06:32.029 --> 01:06:32.039 align:start position:0%
chairman infantine uh one of the points
 
01:06:34.549 --> 01:06:34.559 align:start position:0%
he was making so here you can see that
 
01:06:37.109 --> 01:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
when we look at the maximum weekly
 
01:06:41.510 --> 01:06:41.520 align:start position:0%
benefit amount um from state to state um
 
01:06:43.069 --> 01:06:43.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's is
 
01:06:45.269 --> 01:06:45.279 align:start position:0%
427 um what that
 
01:06:48.029 --> 01:06:48.039 align:start position:0%
427 um maximum weekly benefit amount
 
01:06:50.190 --> 01:06:50.200 align:start position:0%
translates when compared against other
 
01:06:54.470 --> 01:06:54.480 align:start position:0%
states is that is it is the 19th lowest
 
01:06:57.589 --> 01:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit in the country um so you
 
01:07:01.510 --> 01:07:01.520 align:start position:0%
got 18 states that have a lower um
 
01:07:03.349 --> 01:07:03.359 align:start position:0%
maximum weekly benefit amount and you
 
01:07:06.230 --> 01:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
can see those States in that top chart
 
01:07:08.150 --> 01:07:08.160 align:start position:0%
and then when we look only at the
 
01:07:10.870 --> 01:07:10.880 align:start position:0%
Northeast um you can see that even
 
01:07:13.750 --> 01:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
though we're um 19th lowest in the
 
01:07:15.950 --> 01:07:15.960 align:start position:0%
country um we are the lowest in the
 
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
Northeast so at 427 in New Hampshire
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
your maximum weekly benefit amount um
 
01:07:24.430 --> 01:07:24.440 align:start position:0%
ver uh New York is at 504
 
01:07:26.710 --> 01:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
and then far to the right uh New
 
01:07:28.670 --> 01:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh Massachusetts here would be
 
01:07:31.470 --> 01:07:31.480 align:start position:0%
the outlier at having a maximum weekly
 
01:07:33.549 --> 01:07:33.559 align:start position:0%
benefit amount of over
 
01:07:37.710 --> 01:07:37.720 align:start position:0%
$1,400 um and this does include um a lot
 
01:07:39.870 --> 01:07:39.880 align:start position:0%
of states have dependency allowances so
 
01:07:42.150 --> 01:07:42.160 align:start position:0%
that if you you have uh you know for the
 
01:07:44.390 --> 01:07:44.400 align:start position:0%
for however many children uh that you
 
01:07:45.990 --> 01:07:46.000 align:start position:0%
have or dependence you're allowed an
 
01:07:47.710 --> 01:07:47.720 align:start position:0%
additional amount of weekly benefits
 
01:07:49.230 --> 01:07:49.240 align:start position:0%
that includes all of that New Hampshire
 
01:07:51.549 --> 01:07:51.559 align:start position:0%
does not have that so uh most of those
 
01:07:54.269 --> 01:07:54.279 align:start position:0%
other states do Massachusetts does um
 
01:07:56.990 --> 01:07:57.000 align:start position:0%
but that shows you the maximum weekly
 
01:07:58.710 --> 01:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
benefit amount available and how New
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Compares um to our neighbors
 
01:08:02.789 --> 01:08:02.799 align:start position:0%
in the
 
01:08:05.589 --> 01:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
Northeast um when we flip to the next
 
01:08:08.430 --> 01:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
set of charts um this these two charts
 
01:08:10.470 --> 01:08:10.480 align:start position:0%
try to show where New Hampshire would
 
01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:14.720 align:start position:0%
fall if House Bill 1522 were passed so
 
01:08:18.470 --> 01:08:18.480 align:start position:0%
um we have the the 19th lowest um
 
01:08:21.470 --> 01:08:21.480 align:start position:0%
maximum weekly benefit amount currently
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
and if House Bill 1522 were passed we
 
01:08:26.870 --> 01:08:26.880 align:start position:0%
would have the eighth highest maximum
 
01:08:29.269 --> 01:08:29.279 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount uh that amount as
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
proposed is
 
01:08:33.749 --> 01:08:33.759 align:start position:0%
$753 a week so that's about a 75%
 
01:08:36.590 --> 01:08:36.600 align:start position:0%
increase from our current ma uh maximum
 
01:08:38.510 --> 01:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount and would put us
 
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
as having eighth highest in the country
 
01:08:42.630 --> 01:08:42.640 align:start position:0%
however when you look at the bottom
 
01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:45.560 align:start position:0%
chart with these two charts um it still
 
01:08:48.630 --> 01:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
has us at the bottom of the Northeast um
 
01:08:52.829 --> 01:08:52.839 align:start position:0%
so at 753 we would be the third lowest U
 
01:08:54.990 --> 01:08:55.000 align:start position:0%
maximum weekly B benefit amount in the
 
01:08:57.149 --> 01:08:57.159 align:start position:0%
Northeast with New York and Vermont
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
being lower than us but Connecticut uh
 
01:09:01.950 --> 01:09:01.960 align:start position:0%
still being slightly higher Maine being
 
01:09:05.030 --> 01:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
um up at 894 um so Maine being on the on
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
the right hand side not near
 
01:09:08.430 --> 01:09:08.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts um in dollar amount but
 
01:09:12.510 --> 01:09:12.520 align:start position:0%
near Massachusetts in ranking uh there
 
01:09:15.749 --> 01:09:15.759 align:start position:0%
um now when we flip to the next side of
 
01:09:18.390 --> 01:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
pages we're going to um look at the
 
01:09:21.309 --> 01:09:21.319 align:start position:0%
other side of the unemployment benefit
 
01:09:24.149 --> 01:09:24.159 align:start position:0%
system but get to the revenue side um to
 
01:09:26.990 --> 01:09:27.000 align:start position:0%
look at the taxes being paid by
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
employers that go into our trust fund
 
01:09:32.709 --> 01:09:32.719 align:start position:0%
and again it's it's a 100% employer
 
01:09:34.990 --> 01:09:35.000 align:start position:0%
funded system uh for the payment of
 
01:09:36.829 --> 01:09:36.839 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits we'll look at what
 
01:09:40.269 --> 01:09:40.279 align:start position:0%
the trend in employer tax rates has been
 
01:09:43.709 --> 01:09:43.719 align:start position:0%
um we'll do some national comparison for
 
01:09:45.789 --> 01:09:45.799 align:start position:0%
that what that overall unemployment tax
 
01:09:47.990 --> 01:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
burden is on New Hampshire employers
 
01:09:50.269 --> 01:09:50.279 align:start position:0%
compared to other states um and then
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
we'll look at our current trust fund
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
forecast and then we'll get into into um
 
01:09:58.430 --> 01:09:58.440 align:start position:0%
looking at what the proposal um in House
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
Bill 1522 uh would do to the uh uh
 
01:10:03.669 --> 01:10:03.679 align:start position:0%
current trust fund and we do some stress
 
01:10:05.510 --> 01:10:05.520 align:start position:0%
testing uh for folks so you can see what
 
01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:07.640 align:start position:0%
the impact would be um but real quick on
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
that bottom chart looking at what the
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
annual average uh quarterly average uh
 
01:10:14.470 --> 01:10:14.480 align:start position:0%
tax rate for employers has done and we
 
01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
are back to pre-pandemic levels um so uh
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
Q3 of
 
01:10:22.110 --> 01:10:22.120 align:start position:0%
2023 that average rate that an employer
 
01:10:25.390 --> 01:10:25.400 align:start position:0%
is paying on that first $14,000 in
 
01:10:28.990 --> 01:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
annual wages to each employee is
 
01:10:31.270 --> 01:10:31.280 align:start position:0%
0.57% uh so we were back below where we
 
01:10:34.149 --> 01:10:34.159 align:start position:0%
were uh prior to the pandemic and that
 
01:10:36.990 --> 01:10:37.000 align:start position:0%
0.57% translates to about $80 per
 
01:10:40.110 --> 01:10:40.120 align:start position:0%
employee per year that is being paid uh
 
01:10:41.270 --> 01:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
by that
 
01:10:45.030 --> 01:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
employer um when we flip um to the next
 
01:10:47.390 --> 01:10:47.400 align:start position:0%
set of charts this is where we try to
 
01:10:49.830 --> 01:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
equalize it a little bit and um US
 
01:10:51.910 --> 01:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
government does publish data on trying
 
01:10:54.550 --> 01:10:54.560 align:start position:0%
to um do that Apple's Apple's comparison
 
01:10:57.070 --> 01:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
for overall unemployment insurance tax
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
burdens across from state to state and
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
so what again they look at they look at
 
01:11:04.550 --> 01:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
total unemployment taxes paid compared
 
01:11:08.270 --> 01:11:08.280 align:start position:0%
against total wages paid um and when you
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
do that and you see this top chart you
 
01:11:11.790 --> 01:11:11.800 align:start position:0%
see that New Hampshire has the 14th
 
01:11:15.630 --> 01:11:15.640 align:start position:0%
lowest UI tax burden in the country and
 
01:11:18.189 --> 01:11:18.199 align:start position:0%
um that top chart shows the states um
 
01:11:20.070 --> 01:11:20.080 align:start position:0%
that are lower so although New Hampshire
 
01:11:22.189 --> 01:11:22.199 align:start position:0%
is on the far right of that top chart
 
01:11:24.350 --> 01:11:24.360 align:start position:0%
that is not where we fall now nationally
 
01:11:26.790 --> 01:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
nor in in the Northeast um but you can
 
01:11:28.830 --> 01:11:28.840 align:start position:0%
see those other states that have a lower
 
01:11:32.229 --> 01:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
overall UI tax burden um in terms of how
 
01:11:35.189 --> 01:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
much is paid in UI tax um when we when
 
01:11:36.870 --> 01:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
we look down at the bottom chart you'll
 
01:11:39.350 --> 01:11:39.360 align:start position:0%
see that um when we look in the
 
01:11:42.110 --> 01:11:42.120 align:start position:0%
Northeast um New Hampshire's overall UI
 
01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:43.480 align:start position:0%
tax burden at
 
01:11:46.709 --> 01:11:46.719 align:start position:0%
0.27% is the lowest in the Northeast um
 
01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840 align:start position:0%
and surprisingly Massachusetts is right
 
01:11:51.149 --> 01:11:51.159 align:start position:0%
right next to us on that at 0
 
01:11:54.430 --> 01:11:54.440 align:start position:0%
4% um um director Dr golob and I were
 
01:11:55.669 --> 01:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
actually talking about that the other
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
day and and Massachusetts does
 
01:11:59.910 --> 01:11:59.920 align:start position:0%
historically deplete their trust funds
 
01:12:01.709 --> 01:12:01.719 align:start position:0%
and they depend on borrowing from the
 
01:12:03.229 --> 01:12:03.239 align:start position:0%
federal government to pay benefits when
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
we get hit with an economic downturn uh
 
01:12:06.950 --> 01:12:06.960 align:start position:0%
so I think that's why you see them at
 
01:12:08.910 --> 01:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
point4 um they certainly don't have a
 
01:12:11.430 --> 01:12:11.440 align:start position:0%
solvent trust fund um which is an
 
01:12:12.709 --> 01:12:12.719 align:start position:0%
important factor to take into
 
01:12:14.790 --> 01:12:14.800 align:start position:0%
consideration but looking at so that
 
01:12:16.990 --> 01:12:17.000 align:start position:0%
gives you a better sense of how New
 
01:12:19.470 --> 01:12:19.480 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employers are doing compared
 
01:12:21.550 --> 01:12:21.560 align:start position:0%
to Employers in other states from a UI
 
01:12:24.550 --> 01:12:24.560 align:start position:0%
tax burden perspective
 
01:12:27.070 --> 01:12:27.080 align:start position:0%
um and when we turn the page you can see
 
01:12:29.110 --> 01:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
our our current state of our trust fund
 
01:12:31.510 --> 01:12:31.520 align:start position:0%
so this is this is the state
 
01:12:33.229 --> 01:12:33.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation trust fund
 
01:12:35.669 --> 01:12:35.679 align:start position:0%
this is where the taxes paid by
 
01:12:37.990 --> 01:12:38.000 align:start position:0%
employers and the reimbursed dollars
 
01:12:40.430 --> 01:12:40.440 align:start position:0%
from those government employers and
 
01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:43.040 align:start position:0%
those nonprofits those dollars go into
 
01:12:45.110 --> 01:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
our trust fund it does not sit here in
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um as representative
 
01:12:48.910 --> 01:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
mckeny had indicated had pointed out
 
01:12:50.629 --> 01:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
this is this sits with Washington this
 
01:12:53.030 --> 01:12:53.040 align:start position:0%
sits with US Treasury um in New
 
01:12:55.590 --> 01:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire draws down on this on a daily
 
01:12:58.950 --> 01:12:58.960 align:start position:0%
basis um to pay benefits um but these
 
01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
are New Hampshire's dollars um these are
 
01:13:03.629 --> 01:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
these do not belong to any other state
 
01:13:05.830 --> 01:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh the the trust fund dollars are New
 
01:13:08.750 --> 01:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's and only can be paid for
 
01:13:11.229 --> 01:13:11.239 align:start position:0%
benefit recipients in New Hampshire uh
 
01:13:15.189 --> 01:13:15.199 align:start position:0%
so so right now um we are in the almost
 
01:13:18.550 --> 01:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
$400 million range uh we forecast a
 
01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:21.080 align:start position:0%
quarter ending balance I say we I have
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
no part of that whatsoever that we
 
01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
is the uh economic and labor market
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
information Bureau headed headed up by
 
01:13:30.870 --> 01:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
director golob here um but they are
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
forecasting that we will that we will
 
01:13:36.390 --> 01:13:36.400 align:start position:0%
stay close to $400 million and then at
 
01:13:38.709 --> 01:13:38.719 align:start position:0%
the end of uh
 
01:13:41.910 --> 01:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
2025 um we will sustain a balance for
 
01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
one quarter that is above $400 million
 
01:13:47.550 --> 01:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
which would then increase the amount of
 
01:13:51.070 --> 01:13:51.080 align:start position:0%
a discount applied to um employers tax
 
01:13:53.430 --> 01:13:53.440 align:start position:0%
rates so employers they get a series of
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
discounts they get a um to whatever your
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
rate is you cannot pay below
 
01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:02.360 align:start position:0%
.1% um but you have a series of
 
01:14:04.870 --> 01:14:04.880 align:start position:0%
discounts that if the fund maintains a
 
01:14:08.189 --> 01:14:08.199 align:start position:0%
balance of at least $250 million you get
 
01:14:11.070 --> 01:14:11.080 align:start position:0%
a 0.5 reduction to your rate so if
 
01:14:13.990 --> 01:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
you're a new employer starting at a 2.7%
 
01:14:15.910 --> 01:14:15.920 align:start position:0%
rate that brings you down to
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
2.2 and if we maintain a balance of $350
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
for an entire quarter $350 million that
 
01:14:25.629 --> 01:14:25.639 align:start position:0%
brings your rate down by 1% so that new
 
01:14:29.149 --> 01:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
employer at 2.7 would be down to 1.7
 
01:14:30.990 --> 01:14:31.000 align:start position:0%
that's where we're currently at um we
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
are currently at a 1% discount on
 
01:14:34.830 --> 01:14:34.840 align:start position:0%
employer tax rates because we've
 
01:14:38.430 --> 01:14:38.440 align:start position:0%
maintained a balance above 350 million
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
but we have not hit that $400 million
 
01:14:43.830 --> 01:14:43.840 align:start position:0%
Mark which is that top threshold so when
 
01:14:47.030 --> 01:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
we maintain 400 million employers
 
01:14:50.590 --> 01:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
receive a 1.5% reduction to their tax
 
01:14:53.510 --> 01:14:53.520 align:start position:0%
rate so that new employer starting at 27
 
01:14:55.430 --> 01:14:55.440 align:start position:0%
that employer would get brought down to
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
1.2 if we were to hit that
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
1.5% now we are looking we are
 
01:15:02.550 --> 01:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
forecasting that we will maintain a
 
01:15:04.510 --> 01:15:04.520 align:start position:0%
balance over that um but when you're
 
01:15:06.870 --> 01:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
talking a few million dollars on a $400
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
million account and we're looking out
 
01:15:13.590 --> 01:15:13.600 align:start position:0%
towards the end of 25 um that is a
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
projection that will likely be missed
 
01:15:18.910 --> 01:15:18.920 align:start position:0%
either to the South or to the north of
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
that um we're never exact we're not
 
01:15:24.629 --> 01:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
quite as close as uh secretary of state
 
01:15:27.270 --> 01:15:27.280 align:start position:0%
scandin was with his uh number of I
 
01:15:28.910 --> 01:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
think he was off by a thousand voters in
 
01:15:30.470 --> 01:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
the Republican primary I thought he did
 
01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:33.239 align:start position:0%
pretty good with that um we might not be
 
01:15:35.470 --> 01:15:35.480 align:start position:0%
as close there but it's you know it
 
01:15:38.189 --> 01:15:38.199 align:start position:0%
could uh be a little bit under that 400
 
01:15:39.790 --> 01:15:39.800 align:start position:0%
400 million Mark could be a little bit
 
01:15:43.070 --> 01:15:43.080 align:start position:0%
higher um but that's our our um forecast
 
01:15:45.870 --> 01:15:45.880 align:start position:0%
at the current Point um and then um with
 
01:15:47.550 --> 01:15:47.560 align:start position:0%
that I did I think representative K Hill
 
01:15:48.990 --> 01:15:49.000 align:start position:0%
you had a
 
01:15:52.149 --> 01:15:52.159 align:start position:0%
question thank you uh with the higher
 
01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
wages that we've seen
 
01:15:55.709 --> 01:15:55.719 align:start position:0%
the employers are hitting that maximum
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
pretty quickly aren't they the maximum
 
01:16:01.590 --> 01:16:01.600 align:start position:0%
that they'll be taxed on correct yeah so
 
01:16:04.830 --> 01:16:04.840 align:start position:0%
that so it's the first 14,000 in annual
 
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
earnings per employee that they pay at
 
01:16:08.950 --> 01:16:08.960 align:start position:0%
that experience rate yep so when you
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
have when you're um paying more and you
 
01:16:13.669 --> 01:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
don't have seasonal patterns to your
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
your employment a lot of that tax is
 
01:16:17.750 --> 01:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
being paid as a as a result of your
 
01:16:19.390 --> 01:16:19.400 align:start position:0%
first quarter maybe a little bit in your
 
01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
second quarter so that when you have
 
01:16:24.110 --> 01:16:24.120 align:start position:0%
another another discount that employer
 
01:16:26.310 --> 01:16:26.320 align:start position:0%
isn't benefiting because he's already
 
01:16:28.830 --> 01:16:28.840 align:start position:0%
paid he's already done yeah so that's a
 
01:16:30.990 --> 01:16:31.000 align:start position:0%
very good point one I should have made
 
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
um if you know if you're not seeing uh
 
01:16:35.790 --> 01:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
the additional discount applied until a
 
01:16:37.709 --> 01:16:37.719 align:start position:0%
later quarter in the year you know
 
01:16:40.149 --> 01:16:40.159 align:start position:0%
you're if you're your traditional
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
employment pattern is flat and you don't
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
have a seasonal mix to that um you're
 
01:16:47.030 --> 01:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
you're going to hit your your full
 
01:16:48.790 --> 01:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
amount of unemployment insurance tax in
 
01:16:51.430 --> 01:16:51.440 align:start position:0%
those first two quarters so when
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
Employment Security comes back and says
 
01:16:54.870 --> 01:16:54.880 align:start position:0%
hey hey we got a 1 and a half% discount
 
01:16:56.910 --> 01:16:56.920 align:start position:0%
for you in the fourth quarter um it
 
01:16:59.470 --> 01:16:59.480 align:start position:0%
might not mean that much to you if it
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
sticks around for the first quarter it
 
01:17:03.390 --> 01:17:03.400 align:start position:0%
certainly does but it might not mean
 
01:17:04.910 --> 01:17:04.920 align:start position:0%
that much for the majority of employers
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
when it hits in say the third or the
 
01:17:09.310 --> 01:17:09.320 align:start position:0%
fourth quarter thank
 
01:17:11.790 --> 01:17:11.800 align:start position:0%
you um and with that I'll I'll turn it
 
01:17:13.629 --> 01:17:13.639 align:start position:0%
over to director golob to bring us
 
01:17:15.470 --> 01:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
through some of the projections that
 
01:17:18.510 --> 01:17:18.520 align:start position:0%
he's done um looking at House Bill 1522
 
01:17:19.669 --> 01:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
and and the impact that it would have on
 
01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:20.679 align:start position:0%
the trust
 
01:17:24.189 --> 01:17:24.199 align:start position:0%
fund um I'll
 
01:17:24.199 --> 01:17:25.830 align:start position:0%
fund um I'll
um

01:17:25.830 --> 01:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:28.830 --> 01:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
well I'll skip through some some of this
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
first uh segment here and and go to the
 
01:17:34.070 --> 01:17:34.080 align:start position:0%
page after that because that's really
 
01:17:37.550 --> 01:17:37.560 align:start position:0%
gets at the heart of how we model this
 
01:17:39.110 --> 01:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
um the first thing I should say is that
 
01:17:41.550 --> 01:17:41.560 align:start position:0%
we did look at actual claims from the
 
01:17:43.270 --> 01:17:43.280 align:start position:0%
first three quarters of
 
01:17:45.910 --> 01:17:45.920 align:start position:0%
2023 and applied the new benefit
 
01:17:47.950 --> 01:17:47.960 align:start position:0%
schedule to see what the implications
 
01:17:50.590 --> 01:17:50.600 align:start position:0%
would be and as you can see from the
 
01:17:53.070 --> 01:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
chart um benefit payments would have
 
01:17:54.709 --> 01:17:54.719 align:start position:0%
risen about
 
01:17:58.350 --> 01:17:58.360 align:start position:0%
47% during that time period um that's a
 
01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:01.520 align:start position:0%
lot a really significant increase um but
 
01:18:03.790 --> 01:18:03.800 align:start position:0%
I will also say that it in a lot of ways
 
01:18:06.030 --> 01:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
it minimizes what the impact overall
 
01:18:09.189 --> 01:18:09.199 align:start position:0%
will be in over the longer term because
 
01:18:12.030 --> 01:18:12.040 align:start position:0%
the first three quarters of 2023 were a
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
very good year we had very low levels of
 
01:18:18.270 --> 01:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
claims um and we had people who filed
 
01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
for benefits for a very short period of
 
01:18:23.870 --> 01:18:23.880 align:start position:0%
time so that all minimized
 
01:18:25.550 --> 01:18:25.560 align:start position:0%
the amount of payments that were going
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
out in a situation where the payments
 
01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
were made for longer periods of time in
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
a weaker economy uh more claims the the
 
01:18:36.310 --> 01:18:36.320 align:start position:0%
likely implications would be larger um
 
01:18:38.590 --> 01:18:38.600 align:start position:0%
the next chart just shows um and it gets
 
01:18:40.629 --> 01:18:40.639 align:start position:0%
at some of the I think really important
 
01:18:42.590 --> 01:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
points that have been made here um
 
01:18:45.310 --> 01:18:45.320 align:start position:0%
representative uh Sullivan made a point
 
01:18:51.350 --> 01:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
about um the impact that capping at 415
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
41,500 uh as the maximum earnings that
 
01:18:57.750 --> 01:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
someone can have before they reach the
 
01:19:00.590 --> 01:19:00.600 align:start position:0%
maximum benefit payment um that number
 
01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:03.480 align:start position:0%
has increased pretty significantly over
 
01:19:07.229 --> 01:19:07.239 align:start position:0%
the time period that was last changed
 
01:19:10.709 --> 01:19:10.719 align:start position:0%
2007 2007 it was many fewer individuals
 
01:19:14.030 --> 01:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
reaching that number now it is many more
 
01:19:16.110 --> 01:19:16.120 align:start position:0%
so what you see in this chart is half
 
01:19:18.350 --> 01:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
over half the individuals during that
 
01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
time period that we looked at the
 
01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:23.120 align:start position:0%
January to September time period 56%
 
01:19:25.189 --> 01:19:25.199 align:start position:0%
were above that
 
01:19:26.870 --> 01:19:26.880 align:start position:0%
415 that
 
01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:30.239 align:start position:0%
41,500 the effect of that of course is
 
01:19:33.910 --> 01:19:33.920 align:start position:0%
to lower the overall wage replacement
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
ratio because you got a bunch of people
 
01:19:38.229 --> 01:19:38.239 align:start position:0%
who are getting a much smaller
 
01:19:40.270 --> 01:19:40.280 align:start position:0%
percentage if you look at the benefit
 
01:19:42.950 --> 01:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
schedule as it is right now the
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
52 levels that we have the replacement
 
01:19:49.470 --> 01:19:49.480 align:start position:0%
ratio the wage replacement ratio is
 
01:19:53.430 --> 01:19:53.440 align:start position:0%
exactly the same as it was in 2007 no
 
01:19:57.390 --> 01:19:57.400 align:start position:0%
impact it's people who earn above
 
01:20:00.510 --> 01:20:00.520 align:start position:0%
41,500 where the wage replacement ratio
 
01:20:04.110 --> 01:20:04.120 align:start position:0%
because it the maximum amount is
 
01:20:08.189 --> 01:20:08.199 align:start position:0%
$427 over the next 16 years that
 
01:20:10.550 --> 01:20:10.560 align:start position:0%
effective replacement ratio has gone
 
01:20:12.709 --> 01:20:12.719 align:start position:0%
down because people's earnings we have
 
01:20:15.070 --> 01:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
more people making earning higher levels
 
01:20:17.270 --> 01:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
so that's having a big impact on the
 
01:20:19.310 --> 01:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
wage replacement ratio it's having a big
 
01:20:21.550 --> 01:20:21.560 align:start position:0%
impact on the average benefit and there
 
01:20:23.030 --> 01:20:23.040 align:start position:0%
a big reason why our aage average
 
01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
benefit payment is as low as it is so
 
01:20:28.669 --> 01:20:28.679 align:start position:0%
that's a kind of a long explanation and
 
01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:34.280 align:start position:0%
there you see um the the uh the you I
 
01:20:35.550 --> 01:20:35.560 align:start position:0%
can't what was this one I can't even
 
01:20:37.830 --> 01:20:37.840 align:start position:0%
remember what this one oh this next
 
01:20:41.310 --> 01:20:41.320 align:start position:0%
chart just looks at if if you took the
 
01:20:43.709 --> 01:20:43.719 align:start position:0%
same clim claim filing population from
 
01:20:45.990 --> 01:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
2023 that director golob had just
 
01:20:48.470 --> 01:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
mentioned and you plug them into
 
01:20:50.669 --> 01:20:50.679 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie's wage uh
 
01:20:54.550 --> 01:20:54.560 align:start position:0%
benefits schedule instead of that 4,100
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
hitting the max of 427 you'd have about
 
01:21:03.310 --> 01:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
32% hit that Max so about 2,300 would
 
01:21:05.910 --> 01:21:05.920 align:start position:0%
hit that new Max of 753 so they would
 
01:21:08.669 --> 01:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
need to have at least uh
 
01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
57,500 in base period earnings um but
 
01:21:13.910 --> 01:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
you'd have you still have over 2,300
 
01:21:18.149 --> 01:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
individuals or about 32% rather than 56%
 
01:21:19.149 --> 01:21:19.159 align:start position:0%
hitting that
 
01:21:22.350 --> 01:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
Max thank you um the next chart begins
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
our process of taking a look at what
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
would happen under the new benefit
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
schedule first thing we did was we did a
 
01:21:31.629 --> 01:21:31.639 align:start position:0%
backcast basically we plugged in the new
 
01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
benefit schedule to our actual claims
 
01:21:37.950 --> 01:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
history um from
 
01:21:43.990 --> 01:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
2021 Q4 through 2023 Q3 and we have um a
 
01:21:46.270 --> 01:21:46.280 align:start position:0%
rather complex economic model
 
01:21:49.430 --> 01:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
econometric model um that does this
 
01:21:52.870 --> 01:21:52.880 align:start position:0%
forecasting so when we plug in the new
 
01:21:56.350 --> 01:21:56.360 align:start position:0%
benefit schedule and it there is some
 
01:21:58.590 --> 01:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
assumptions involved in that um what we
 
01:22:01.030 --> 01:22:01.040 align:start position:0%
found is that our trust fund would have
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
performed it would have had a balance at
 
01:22:05.790 --> 01:22:05.800 align:start position:0%
about $65 million lower than it
 
01:22:08.750 --> 01:22:08.760 align:start position:0%
currently has so that's using actual
 
01:22:11.149 --> 01:22:11.159 align:start position:0%
numbers when we look forward we're
 
01:22:12.990 --> 01:22:13.000 align:start position:0%
making some assumptions about what the
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
claims levels will be um and we've done
 
01:22:18.470 --> 01:22:18.480 align:start position:0%
that under a few different scenarios the
 
01:22:20.950 --> 01:22:20.960 align:start position:0%
first one is that forecast that we
 
01:22:24.550 --> 01:22:24.560 align:start position:0%
showed you in a few charts ago of
 
01:22:30.270 --> 01:22:30.280 align:start position:0%
$393 million ending balance for Q4 2025
 
01:22:32.270 --> 01:22:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's our Baseline forecast that
 
01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:34.239 align:start position:0%
Baseline forecast by the way includes
 
01:22:37.030 --> 01:22:37.040 align:start position:0%
some uptick and claims over the next few
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
quarters we expect the the labor market
 
01:22:41.629 --> 01:22:41.639 align:start position:0%
will slow a little bit no recession but
 
01:22:44.550 --> 01:22:44.560 align:start position:0%
it will pick up some so when we plug in
 
01:22:48.510 --> 01:22:48.520 align:start position:0%
the new benefit schedule into that we
 
01:22:51.070 --> 01:22:51.080 align:start position:0%
wind up with
 
01:22:55.229 --> 01:22:55.239 align:start position:0%
a a impact Act of about $50 million less
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
on the on the trust fund there are some
 
01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.000 align:start position:0%
assumptions that I think um and this is
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
really getting into the weeds I do think
 
01:23:06.310 --> 01:23:06.320 align:start position:0%
this is a little bit optimistic for the
 
01:23:08.030 --> 01:23:08.040 align:start position:0%
forecast for the new benefit schedule
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
for one big reason there's a recognition
 
01:23:14.870 --> 01:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
that um when you increase benefits
 
01:23:17.550 --> 01:23:17.560 align:start position:0%
significantly you tend to increase the
 
01:23:20.910 --> 01:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
length of time of uh that individuals
 
01:23:24.790 --> 01:23:24.800 align:start position:0%
are unemployed it becomes a little and
 
01:23:27.070 --> 01:23:27.080 align:start position:0%
and this I don't want this to sound
 
01:23:30.149 --> 01:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
harsh but but people if they're a little
 
01:23:32.110 --> 01:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
bit more comfortable then not they're
 
01:23:33.750 --> 01:23:33.760 align:start position:0%
not comfortable losing their job for
 
01:23:37.110 --> 01:23:37.120 align:start position:0%
sure but you know we see it in in states
 
01:23:39.830 --> 01:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
that have very high pen benefit payments
 
01:23:41.590 --> 01:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
we see the duration is a little bit
 
01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:43.960 align:start position:0%
longer and that's not my view that's
 
01:23:46.030 --> 01:23:46.040 align:start position:0%
generally recognized in economic
 
01:23:47.669 --> 01:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
research that the more generous the
 
01:23:49.430 --> 01:23:49.440 align:start position:0%
payments are generally that will
 
01:23:51.189 --> 01:23:51.199 align:start position:0%
increase the length of time that
 
01:23:53.669 --> 01:23:53.679 align:start position:0%
individuals that was not included in
 
01:23:57.590 --> 01:23:57.600 align:start position:0%
this so we made we made this forecast
 
01:24:00.030 --> 01:24:00.040 align:start position:0%
basically assuming there would be no
 
01:24:02.709 --> 01:24:02.719 align:start position:0%
impact um and when I say we made that
 
01:24:04.189 --> 01:24:04.199 align:start position:0%
assumption it was because it was very
 
01:24:06.149 --> 01:24:06.159 align:start position:0%
hard to include that into the model
 
01:24:08.430 --> 01:24:08.440 align:start position:0%
maybe in future iterations we'll be able
 
01:24:10.350 --> 01:24:10.360 align:start position:0%
to do that but it's clear that it would
 
01:24:12.669 --> 01:24:12.679 align:start position:0%
have some impact on the duration of
 
01:24:15.189 --> 01:24:15.199 align:start position:0%
employment and if we factor that in I
 
01:24:17.390 --> 01:24:17.400 align:start position:0%
think the impacts on the trust fund
 
01:24:19.910 --> 01:24:19.920 align:start position:0%
would be greater Mr go we have a
 
01:24:23.310 --> 01:24:23.320 align:start position:0%
question go ahead mam thank you Mr chair
 
01:24:26.030 --> 01:24:26.040 align:start position:0%
um I've had this question from a few
 
01:24:28.790 --> 01:24:28.800 align:start position:0%
slides ago on it's the flip side of what
 
01:24:31.550 --> 01:24:31.560 align:start position:0%
you're saying do we have a sense when we
 
01:24:33.510 --> 01:24:33.520 align:start position:0%
look at that you know like I think it
 
01:24:33.520 --> 01:24:34.229 align:start position:0%
look at that you know like I think it
was

01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:34.239 align:start position:0%
was
 
01:24:38.669 --> 01:24:38.679 align:start position:0%
10% um is how many folks Go the whole
 
01:24:42.510 --> 01:24:42.520 align:start position:0%
duration 11% so we're one of the lowest
 
01:24:45.310 --> 01:24:45.320 align:start position:0%
um do we have a and I imagine if folks
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
are getting a lower rate they can't
 
01:24:50.590 --> 01:24:50.600 align:start position:0%
afford there is a pressure to get a job
 
01:24:53.030 --> 01:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
right away but do we have a sense
 
01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:55.880 align:start position:0%
as to for example in in representative
 
01:24:58.669 --> 01:24:58.679 align:start position:0%
McKenzie's example at Berlin you know I
 
01:25:00.830 --> 01:25:00.840 align:start position:0%
can imagine in the in the example he
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
cites you're not making a better wage
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
than you did before you were unemployed
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
right so do you have a sense of how that
 
01:25:11.950 --> 01:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
correlates to or how our wages correlate
 
01:25:13.590 --> 01:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
to how it is of getting off of
 
01:25:17.510 --> 01:25:17.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment into a new job is better
 
01:25:19.550 --> 01:25:19.560 align:start position:0%
worse equal I'm
 
01:25:24.149 --> 01:25:24.159 align:start position:0%
suspecting it's worse um I don't now
 
01:25:26.830 --> 01:25:26.840 align:start position:0%
although that is part of an evaluation
 
01:25:29.550 --> 01:25:29.560 align:start position:0%
process that we're looking at going at
 
01:25:31.950 --> 01:25:31.960 align:start position:0%
at going through um that's required by
 
01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor basically uh
 
01:25:35.990 --> 01:25:36.000 align:start position:0%
taking a look at what happens to
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
individuals after they file for
 
01:25:39.669 --> 01:25:39.679 align:start position:0%
unemployment how quickly they get off
 
01:25:41.590 --> 01:25:41.600 align:start position:0%
what happens in terms of their wages do
 
01:25:44.350 --> 01:25:44.360 align:start position:0%
do they get more um an increase in wages
 
01:25:46.470 --> 01:25:46.480 align:start position:0%
do they do their wages suffer and that's
 
01:25:48.590 --> 01:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
part to evaluate the you know the
 
01:25:51.510 --> 01:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
Reemployment Services that we provide um
 
01:25:53.590 --> 01:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
but I can't say right now off the top of
 
01:25:56.510 --> 01:25:56.520 align:start position:0%
my head I know that and I my guess is it
 
01:25:59.950 --> 01:25:59.960 align:start position:0%
varies pretty significantly by by region
 
01:26:01.870 --> 01:26:01.880 align:start position:0%
um you know representative McKenzie
 
01:26:03.790 --> 01:26:03.800 align:start position:0%
mentioned the the paper mill well there
 
01:26:05.629 --> 01:26:05.639 align:start position:0%
weren't many jobs that probably paid a
 
01:26:08.430 --> 01:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
lot better than the paper mill up there
 
01:26:10.750 --> 01:26:10.760 align:start position:0%
um so I do think that there there is
 
01:26:12.830 --> 01:26:12.840 align:start position:0%
some impact and I I will say that part
 
01:26:14.310 --> 01:26:14.320 align:start position:0%
of the reason why we have such a low
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
exhaustion rate is not just related to
 
01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
our benefit schedule it's related to the
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
strength of our economy you know we have
 
01:26:24.750 --> 01:26:24.760 align:start position:0%
we have a much higher job openings rate
 
01:26:27.629 --> 01:26:27.639 align:start position:0%
than the nation overall so we have a
 
01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:29.000 align:start position:0%
strong economy and when you have a
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
stronger economy that duration rate
 
01:26:33.709 --> 01:26:33.719 align:start position:0%
regardless of your of your benefit
 
01:26:36.830 --> 01:26:36.840 align:start position:0%
schedule it's going to likely Aid in
 
01:26:39.109 --> 01:26:39.119 align:start position:0%
getting people back into the workforce
 
01:26:39.119 --> 01:26:40.550 align:start position:0%
getting people back into the workforce
more

01:26:40.550 --> 01:26:40.560 align:start position:0%
more
 
01:26:43.669 --> 01:26:43.679 align:start position:0%
quickly Mr got L okay I'll take the
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
questions and then I'm going to have you
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
wrap it up in the next five minutes as
 
01:26:49.629 --> 01:26:49.639 align:start position:0%
so representative St followed by U um
 
01:26:52.750 --> 01:26:52.760 align:start position:0%
thank you uh for taking my question um
 
01:26:55.709 --> 01:26:55.719 align:start position:0%
my question is as you are calculating uh
 
01:26:57.189 --> 01:26:57.199 align:start position:0%
the amount of money that's going to be
 
01:26:59.790 --> 01:26:59.800 align:start position:0%
in the trust fund are you including the
 
01:26:59.800 --> 01:27:01.070 align:start position:0%
in the trust fund are you including the
discount

01:27:01.070 --> 01:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
discount
 
01:27:03.910 --> 01:27:03.920 align:start position:0%
rates yes oh yeah the the FBI that has a
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
big impact I mean the benefit schedule
 
01:27:07.990 --> 01:27:08.000 align:start position:0%
has a number of pretty complex impacts
 
01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.400 align:start position:0%
obviously we know what happens with the
 
01:27:11.870 --> 01:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
payment schedule that's very that's the
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
easiest part to forecast but the other
 
01:27:17.270 --> 01:27:17.280 align:start position:0%
big impact is f the fund balance
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
reductions we know that the harder part
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
is what's going to happen to employer
 
01:27:25.229 --> 01:27:25.239 align:start position:0%
tax rates and that's going to be as
 
01:27:28.270 --> 01:27:28.280 align:start position:0%
significant as the benefit payment side
 
01:27:29.910 --> 01:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
of it because we know we're going to be
 
01:27:32.550 --> 01:27:32.560 align:start position:0%
paying out more that gets mitigated we
 
01:27:34.590 --> 01:27:34.600 align:start position:0%
didn't just take that additional amount
 
01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:36.400 align:start position:0%
that's being paid out and subtract it
 
01:27:38.350 --> 01:27:38.360 align:start position:0%
from our Baseline forecast we had to
 
01:27:40.830 --> 01:27:40.840 align:start position:0%
make um assumptions and it when I say
 
01:27:43.470 --> 01:27:43.480 align:start position:0%
assumptions it's based on the you know
 
01:27:46.109 --> 01:27:46.119 align:start position:0%
20 some years of of economic
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
relationships the data that we use to
 
01:27:51.430 --> 01:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
put into this model but what's going to
 
01:27:52.590 --> 01:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
happen is employers are going to be
 
01:27:55.510 --> 01:27:55.520 align:start position:0%
paying more so that mitigates some of
 
01:27:58.149 --> 01:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
the um impact on the trust fund so
 
01:28:00.070 --> 01:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of complex things they all
 
01:28:01.990 --> 01:28:02.000 align:start position:0%
do go in here the one thing again that
 
01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:03.560 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone in here is what is the
 
01:28:05.550 --> 01:28:05.560 align:start position:0%
impact on the amount of time that
 
01:28:07.030 --> 01:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
individuals are going to spend on
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment that's the part that right
 
01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
now our model doesn't
 
01:28:15.189 --> 01:28:15.199 align:start position:0%
incorporate kale followed by love thank
 
01:28:18.669 --> 01:28:18.679 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair and thank you Mr car uh
 
01:28:21.709 --> 01:28:21.719 align:start position:0%
so is it logical to to to think that
 
01:28:24.550 --> 01:28:24.560 align:start position:0%
someone who's making you know close to
 
01:28:27.950 --> 01:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
60,000 is a lot better prepared you know
 
01:28:29.270 --> 01:28:29.280 align:start position:0%
if they're living somewhere within their
 
01:28:32.030 --> 01:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
means than someone who's making 25,000
 
01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
to weather uh a period of
 
01:28:38.990 --> 01:28:39.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment I mean I guess in theory
 
01:28:42.550 --> 01:28:42.560 align:start position:0%
that's the case um they also have the
 
01:28:45.510 --> 01:28:45.520 align:start position:0%
low a much lower wage replacement ratio
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
in our in our current system so they may
 
01:28:50.270 --> 01:28:50.280 align:start position:0%
have greater incentive to find
 
01:28:52.550 --> 01:28:52.560 align:start position:0%
employment quicker somebody making
 
01:28:55.109 --> 01:28:55.119 align:start position:0%
$60,000 is you know their wage
 
01:28:56.430 --> 01:28:56.440 align:start position:0%
replacement ratio is going to be
 
01:28:59.550 --> 01:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
somewhere you know below 40% or 30 some
 
01:29:04.590 --> 01:29:04.600 align:start position:0%
percent so um but uh that in theory I
 
01:29:07.870 --> 01:29:07.880 align:start position:0%
guess hire hire individ individuals who
 
01:29:10.229 --> 01:29:10.239 align:start position:0%
are H earning higher incomes generally
 
01:29:12.390 --> 01:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
have more opportunities um they have
 
01:29:14.590 --> 01:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
more opportunities they tend to have
 
01:29:16.310 --> 01:29:16.320 align:start position:0%
higher levels of educational attainment
 
01:29:19.629 --> 01:29:19.639 align:start position:0%
generally have more um Reemployment
 
01:29:22.910 --> 01:29:22.920 align:start position:0%
opportunities followup followup
 
01:29:25.629 --> 01:29:25.639 align:start position:0%
um so if we were to I think
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie already thought
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
that his his proposal was a little bit
 
01:29:31.590 --> 01:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
high if we were to split the difference
 
01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:34.440 align:start position:0%
we'd still have we would have a uh a
 
01:29:37.669 --> 01:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
better uh balance in the trust fund and
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
less of a of a whack to our employers
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
who are paying but they still they're
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
only being taxed this rate half a
 
01:29:48.350 --> 01:29:48.360 align:start position:0%
percent or whatever uh on the first
 
01:29:50.669 --> 01:29:50.679 align:start position:0%
14,000 does that number me need to be
 
01:29:54.709 --> 01:29:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
um we can model um what those because
 
01:30:00.870 --> 01:30:00.880 align:start position:0%
you got a lot of levers here right to
 
01:30:03.709 --> 01:30:03.719 align:start position:0%
you know when you change one um it's
 
01:30:05.750 --> 01:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
going to have some impact and um you try
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
to isolate that so you can understand it
 
01:30:11.310 --> 01:30:11.320 align:start position:0%
each change the best but we can model um
 
01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:14.719 align:start position:0%
what those changes would be uh probably
 
01:30:16.550 --> 01:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
the easiest one to model rather than
 
01:30:19.430 --> 01:30:19.440 align:start position:0%
getting into uh projecting out rates the
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
easiest one to model is taxable wage
 
01:30:24.149 --> 01:30:24.159 align:start position:0%
base changes um you know there was some
 
01:30:26.149 --> 01:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
discussion with the advisory Council on
 
01:30:28.830 --> 01:30:28.840 align:start position:0%
Monday on that point so that something
 
01:30:30.750 --> 01:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
that can be modeled and look at what the
 
01:30:33.550 --> 01:30:33.560 align:start position:0%
overall impact would be um just to get
 
01:30:35.870 --> 01:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
to your prior question representative as
 
01:30:38.149 --> 01:30:38.159 align:start position:0%
well it's interesting that when you look
 
01:30:40.830 --> 01:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
at the overall condition of the people
 
01:30:42.430 --> 01:30:42.440 align:start position:0%
that were utilizing the unemployment
 
01:30:43.790 --> 01:30:43.800 align:start position:0%
program in
 
01:30:46.750 --> 01:30:46.760 align:start position:0%
2023 that the the first benefit tier
 
01:30:49.470 --> 01:30:49.480 align:start position:0%
that had at least 100 filers over the
 
01:30:51.590 --> 01:30:51.600 align:start position:0%
course of those nine months um was not
 
01:30:54.590 --> 01:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
at the those uh super low benefit tiers
 
01:30:57.709 --> 01:30:57.719 align:start position:0%
it was all the way up at $22,000 a year
 
01:30:59.470 --> 01:30:59.480 align:start position:0%
um so that was the the first benefit
 
01:31:01.910 --> 01:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
tier that had at least 100 people but
 
01:31:04.270 --> 01:31:04.280 align:start position:0%
you know most of them were at that 427
 
01:31:06.149 --> 01:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
and and a lot of the lower benefit tiers
 
01:31:07.590 --> 01:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
I think the bottom five didn't have a
 
01:31:10.030 --> 01:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
single filer um in them over the course
 
01:31:11.550 --> 01:31:11.560 align:start position:0%
of those first nine
 
01:31:14.270 --> 01:31:14.280 align:start position:0%
months thank
 
01:31:17.669 --> 01:31:17.679 align:start position:0%
you love followed by represent directo
 
01:31:19.109 --> 01:31:19.119 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
01:31:21.430 --> 01:31:21.440 align:start position:0%
my question um does New Hampshire have a
 
01:31:24.189 --> 01:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
a uh Provisions in its unemployment
 
01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:27.639 align:start position:0%
program to uh allow for workers to uh
 
01:31:30.149 --> 01:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
unemployed workers to work part-time or
 
01:31:32.830 --> 01:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
find a a lesser paying job temporarily
 
01:31:34.910 --> 01:31:34.920 align:start position:0%
and have it not affect their their um
 
01:31:37.629 --> 01:31:37.639 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits yeah U and we'll
 
01:31:39.430 --> 01:31:39.440 align:start position:0%
get into we'll get into a lot of that
 
01:31:41.550 --> 01:31:41.560 align:start position:0%
with um uh representative Sullivan's
 
01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:43.800 align:start position:0%
bill that's coming up next um so New
 
01:31:44.870 --> 01:31:44.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire just to answer that quickly
 
01:31:48.030 --> 01:31:48.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire does allow um individuals
 
01:31:49.590 --> 01:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
while filing for unemployment benefits
 
01:31:52.790 --> 01:31:52.800 align:start position:0%
to have part-time employment
 
01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:54.400 align:start position:0%
not full-time employment that is not
 
01:31:56.270 --> 01:31:56.280 align:start position:0%
allowed by the federal government but
 
01:31:58.310 --> 01:31:58.320 align:start position:0%
you allowed to have part-time employment
 
01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
and you need to report that work in
 
01:32:01.470 --> 01:32:01.480 align:start position:0%
those earnings while you're
 
01:32:04.669 --> 01:32:04.679 align:start position:0%
collecting up uh would it be beneficial
 
01:32:07.310 --> 01:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
to the state and to the the fund and uh
 
01:32:10.830 --> 01:32:10.840 align:start position:0%
employers if we uh you know we raise
 
01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:14.920 align:start position:0%
that uh that uh the cap on that uh so
 
01:32:17.030 --> 01:32:17.040 align:start position:0%
somebody could uh could make essentially
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
make a little more money rather than um
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
rather than affect the the uh the trust
 
01:32:25.229 --> 01:32:25.239 align:start position:0%
fund and I think you have a supporter of
 
01:32:27.149 --> 01:32:27.159 align:start position:0%
that with representative Sullivan judged
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
by House Bill 1597 be the next Bill
 
01:32:30.480 --> 01:32:32.790 align:start position:0%
by House Bill 1597 be the next Bill
thank

01:32:32.790 --> 01:32:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:36.430 --> 01:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
youo thank you I I just have a couple
 
01:32:39.910 --> 01:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
questions um on the modest recess
 
01:32:42.990 --> 01:32:43.000 align:start position:0%
recession graph oh yeah okay we we're
 
01:32:46.070 --> 01:32:46.080 align:start position:0%
going to address that yes okay yeah then
 
01:32:47.629 --> 01:32:47.639 align:start position:0%
I can wa if I could just I got two more
 
01:32:49.229 --> 01:32:49.239 align:start position:0%
slides that I want to cover because we
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
did we showed you what the impact would
 
01:32:54.910 --> 01:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
be in our base case scenario um but what
 
01:32:57.590 --> 01:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
really what is uh of interest is what
 
01:32:59.669 --> 01:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
would happen in different economics Areo
 
01:33:01.950 --> 01:33:01.960 align:start position:0%
so we modeled two ways one is a modest
 
01:33:04.149 --> 01:33:04.159 align:start position:0%
recession what's a modest recession is
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
basically the recession that we had in
 
01:33:08.229 --> 01:33:08.239 align:start position:0%
the early 2000s and how we did this was
 
01:33:10.790 --> 01:33:10.800 align:start position:0%
we took the actual rate of of Ben
 
01:33:12.390 --> 01:33:12.400 align:start position:0%
benefit claims that were being paid
 
01:33:14.070 --> 01:33:14.080 align:start position:0%
adjusted that for the current number of
 
01:33:16.750 --> 01:33:16.760 align:start position:0%
people who are employed and then ran ran
 
01:33:19.709 --> 01:33:19.719 align:start position:0%
the model that way and what you see is
 
01:33:23.070 --> 01:33:23.080 align:start position:0%
um you know with the with the the
 
01:33:25.270 --> 01:33:25.280 align:start position:0%
current benefits schedule the trust fund
 
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
takes about a $60 million hit around $60
 
01:33:32.229 --> 01:33:32.239 align:start position:0%
million um with the new benefit schedule
 
01:33:35.070 --> 01:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
what happens is we take another $85
 
01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:38.560 align:start position:0%
million hit um beyond that um with the
 
01:33:40.750 --> 01:33:40.760 align:start position:0%
new Under the new benefit schedule and
 
01:33:43.390 --> 01:33:43.400 align:start position:0%
again to some degree this probably is a
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
little bit optimistic because in a
 
01:33:47.109 --> 01:33:47.119 align:start position:0%
recession we're going to have a higher
 
01:33:50.470 --> 01:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh uh you know uh number of weeks that
 
01:33:52.270 --> 01:33:52.280 align:start position:0%
are claimed and we didn't we didn't
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
figure that in the next page is even
 
01:33:59.510 --> 01:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
scarier is what happens um in a severe
 
01:34:00.990 --> 01:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
recession what's a severe recession we
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
modeled same way with the Great
 
01:34:04.430 --> 01:34:04.440 align:start position:0%
Recession took the actual number of
 
01:34:06.550 --> 01:34:06.560 align:start position:0%
claims ran that through the model what
 
01:34:07.629 --> 01:34:07.639 align:start position:0%
it would look like with the current
 
01:34:10.270 --> 01:34:10.280 align:start position:0%
number of employment employees even with
 
01:34:12.270 --> 01:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
the current benefit schedule you know
 
01:34:14.709 --> 01:34:14.719 align:start position:0%
that was a severe recession the the the
 
01:34:18.629 --> 01:34:18.639 align:start position:0%
trust fund us loses $260 million under
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
the new benefit schedule it gets down to
 
01:34:23.950 --> 01:34:23.960 align:start position:0%
kind of dangerously low levels of 78
 
01:34:25.990 --> 01:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
million and again there's margin for
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
error but I think that's optimistic
 
01:34:29.669 --> 01:34:29.679 align:start position:0%
because in a severe recession what
 
01:34:31.189 --> 01:34:31.199 align:start position:0%
you're going to see is a lot of people
 
01:34:34.590 --> 01:34:34.600 align:start position:0%
filing for a lot longer than 10 or 11
 
01:34:38.390 --> 01:34:38.400 align:start position:0%
weeks and that's concludes my comment
 
01:34:40.070 --> 01:34:40.080 align:start position:0%
and I would just add to that and there
 
01:34:42.149 --> 01:34:42.159 align:start position:0%
are some other slides with some some of
 
01:34:44.669 --> 01:34:44.679 align:start position:0%
our takeaways from the modeling you can
 
01:34:47.750 --> 01:34:47.760 align:start position:0%
take a look at them and and help maybe
 
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
um um inform your thoughts around some
 
01:34:52.990 --> 01:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
of the information presented but when
 
01:34:56.390 --> 01:34:56.400 align:start position:0%
you look at the the the model of the
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
severe recession so so the Great
 
01:35:01.629 --> 01:35:01.639 align:start position:0%
Recession um the the good news on that
 
01:35:04.270 --> 01:35:04.280 align:start position:0%
chart is that when you look at what our
 
01:35:06.189 --> 01:35:06.199 align:start position:0%
current benefits schedule what the
 
01:35:08.270 --> 01:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
projected depletion of the UN
 
01:35:09.709 --> 01:35:09.719 align:start position:0%
unemployment trust fund would look like
 
01:35:12.270 --> 01:35:12.280 align:start position:0%
getting down to 160 million that's good
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
performance um that is what the governor
 
01:35:19.629 --> 01:35:19.639 align:start position:0%
and the legislature wanted when the
 
01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
changes were made to budget cycle ago uh
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
to those trust fund uh discount triggers
 
01:35:27.390 --> 01:35:27.400 align:start position:0%
when those discount triggers were raised
 
01:35:28.990 --> 01:35:29.000 align:start position:0%
uh from their old amounts up to the
 
01:35:31.390 --> 01:35:31.400 align:start position:0%
current amounts up to 350 and 400
 
01:35:34.030 --> 01:35:34.040 align:start position:0%
million there was a recognition that
 
01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
true solvency was up in the $400 million
 
01:35:38.510 --> 01:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
range in order for New Hampshire to be
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
able to pay benefits during a a severe
 
01:35:43.229 --> 01:35:43.239 align:start position:0%
recession and not have to rely upon the
 
01:35:45.550 --> 01:35:45.560 align:start position:0%
federal government and that's what that
 
01:35:47.350 --> 01:35:47.360 align:start position:0%
performance right there shows is that we
 
01:35:51.070 --> 01:35:51.080 align:start position:0%
stay above that $150 million Mark which
 
01:35:53.550 --> 01:35:53.560 align:start position:0%
used to be the line of uhoh we're in
 
01:35:55.550 --> 01:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
trouble because that's when there used
 
01:35:57.070 --> 01:35:57.080 align:start position:0%
to be additional sear charges that
 
01:35:58.790 --> 01:35:58.800 align:start position:0%
kicked in on employer rates at that
 
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
point when you look at the impact of The
 
01:36:03.950 --> 01:36:03.960 align:start position:0%
Proposal without any accompanying
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
Revenue changes getting down below 80
 
01:36:10.149 --> 01:36:10.159 align:start position:0%
million that's that's at a point where
 
01:36:12.910 --> 01:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
80 million sounds like a lot to me
 
01:36:15.750 --> 01:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
sounds like a lot to to Brian um because
 
01:36:18.149 --> 01:36:18.159 align:start position:0%
we we're both state government employees
 
01:36:21.070 --> 01:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
um but when you're at that point in the
 
01:36:23.350 --> 01:36:23.360 align:start position:0%
rate at which you are paying out
 
01:36:26.669 --> 01:36:26.679 align:start position:0%
benefits you do not have time to act you
 
01:36:28.750 --> 01:36:28.760 align:start position:0%
are almost guaranteed to have to borrow
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
from the federal government and maybe
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
it'll be a point in time where borrowing
 
01:36:35.070 --> 01:36:35.080 align:start position:0%
is made easy because plenty of other
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
states are doing it and they've loosened
 
01:36:40.870 --> 01:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
the rules around the costs to States
 
01:36:42.990 --> 01:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
however um when you look at the
 
01:36:44.950 --> 01:36:44.960 align:start position:0%
potential cost to States when you do
 
01:36:47.709 --> 01:36:47.719 align:start position:0%
borrow um you're running the risk of
 
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
having to pay borrowing costs um if you
 
01:36:52.750 --> 01:36:52.760 align:start position:0%
don't pay pay those funds back quickly
 
01:36:54.350 --> 01:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
enough the federal government charges
 
01:36:57.189 --> 01:36:57.199 align:start position:0%
the state interest and they also start
 
01:37:00.270 --> 01:37:00.280 align:start position:0%
to increase the federal unemployment
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
rate at which employers are paying their
 
01:37:04.870 --> 01:37:04.880 align:start position:0%
federal unemployment tax so they they
 
01:37:07.669 --> 01:37:07.679 align:start position:0%
try to come down hard on States um and
 
01:37:09.669 --> 01:37:09.679 align:start position:0%
penalize those States and incentivize
 
01:37:11.430 --> 01:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
them to pay back those borrowed funds
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
quickly by making it painful what we saw
 
01:37:15.510 --> 01:37:15.520 align:start position:0%
last time with a Great Recession a lot
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
of States bonded that debt so they they
 
01:37:20.430 --> 01:37:20.440 align:start position:0%
could get out from under the the
 
01:37:22.270 --> 01:37:22.280 align:start position:0%
problems that the federal government
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
would create for their Employers in the
 
01:37:25.990 --> 01:37:26.000 align:start position:0%
state instead they bonded it they didn't
 
01:37:27.790 --> 01:37:27.800 align:start position:0%
get away from the debt they still have
 
01:37:29.550 --> 01:37:29.560 align:start position:0%
to pay it but they they got away from
 
01:37:32.189 --> 01:37:32.199 align:start position:0%
owing it to US Treasury um and having
 
01:37:34.030 --> 01:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
the accompanying penalties to their
 
01:37:36.350 --> 01:37:36.360 align:start position:0%
employers so just some things to think
 
01:37:38.629 --> 01:37:38.639 align:start position:0%
about and looking at that that Great
 
01:37:41.109 --> 01:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
Recession uh type
 
01:37:46.470 --> 01:37:46.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:46.480 --> 01:37:49.350 align:start position:0%
 
you

01:37:49.350 --> 01:37:49.360 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
so looking at the the modest
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
recession um so did you factor that the
 
01:37:58.270 --> 01:37:58.280 align:start position:0%
two if if this were to pass the 252
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
million was that factored on the 11 or
 
01:38:05.870 --> 01:38:05.880 align:start position:0%
the 10 weeks average of benefits or did
 
01:38:08.149 --> 01:38:08.159 align:start position:0%
you increase that we did not increase
 
01:38:11.070 --> 01:38:11.080 align:start position:0%
that and that's why I'm I'm think in any
 
01:38:13.229 --> 01:38:13.239 align:start position:0%
of the recession scenarios they're
 
01:38:15.430 --> 01:38:15.440 align:start position:0%
likely a little bit optimistic for right
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
for the trust fund because you know
 
01:38:21.589 --> 01:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
exactly how what impact that will be um
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
we know in a recession the the the you
 
01:38:27.510 --> 01:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
know the duration of unemployment goes
 
01:38:29.669 --> 01:38:29.679 align:start position:0%
up what that would be we didn't factor
 
01:38:32.030 --> 01:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
into the model model right now is not
 
01:38:33.750 --> 01:38:33.760 align:start position:0%
capable of doing that but we will make
 
01:38:36.589 --> 01:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
modifications to allow
 
01:38:41.149 --> 01:38:41.159 align:start position:0%
it so you kind of equated it to 2008
 
01:38:43.910 --> 01:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
recession well the the modest was it was
 
01:38:48.030 --> 01:38:48.040 align:start position:0%
early 2000 2002 okay was it was a little
 
01:38:49.470 --> 01:38:49.480 align:start position:0%
bit stronger in New Hampshire than
 
01:38:51.070 --> 01:38:51.080 align:start position:0%
nationally but it was consider
 
01:38:53.270 --> 01:38:53.280 align:start position:0%
considered a relatively mild recession
 
01:38:55.709 --> 01:38:55.719 align:start position:0%
are there numbers for how long people
 
01:38:58.589 --> 01:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
filed during that time period there is
 
01:39:01.589 --> 01:39:01.599 align:start position:0%
there is um and I but we just the way
 
01:39:04.629 --> 01:39:04.639 align:start position:0%
the model is constructed it's not
 
01:39:07.070 --> 01:39:07.080 align:start position:0%
capable of doing that over a period of
 
01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:08.880 align:start position:0%
time until we make modifications but it
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
was longer it was longer yes yes and
 
01:39:13.589 --> 01:39:13.599 align:start position:0%
during the Great Recession significantly
 
01:39:15.589 --> 01:39:15.599 align:start position:0%
longer it took us six years to get back
 
01:39:17.109 --> 01:39:17.119 align:start position:0%
all the employment that we lost during
 
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
the gravy session wow and we can provide
 
01:39:21.310 --> 01:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
that data the average duration going
 
01:39:24.790 --> 01:39:24.800 align:start position:0%
back to both of those time periods
 
01:39:29.790 --> 01:39:29.800 align:start position:0%
that's so so likely the number will Pro
 
01:39:31.550 --> 01:39:31.560 align:start position:0%
the amount in the trust F will probably
 
01:39:33.669 --> 01:39:33.679 align:start position:0%
be lower I would guess it will be lower
 
01:39:35.550 --> 01:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
not to mention the fact it's going to be
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
harder to find a job during recession
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
and now if you're getting more money it
 
01:39:41.350 --> 01:39:41.360 align:start position:0%
it's probably not quite as incentivized
 
01:39:43.709 --> 01:39:43.719 align:start position:0%
to try to find another job so it's
 
01:39:45.750 --> 01:39:45.760 align:start position:0%
probably pretty high the the number here
 
01:39:47.470 --> 01:39:47.480 align:start position:0%
I would guess is probably going to
 
01:39:49.870 --> 01:39:49.880 align:start position:0%
be I say substantially I don't know
 
01:39:51.669 --> 01:39:51.679 align:start position:0%
Millions higher than what it really is
 
01:39:54.430 --> 01:39:54.440 align:start position:0%
but and then so so my next question
 
01:39:57.750 --> 01:39:57.760 align:start position:0%
would be when the trust fund drops that
 
01:40:00.510 --> 01:40:00.520 align:start position:0%
much what I forget the acronym to FBR
 
01:40:02.709 --> 01:40:02.719 align:start position:0%
FBR fund balance reduction what will be
 
01:40:05.030 --> 01:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
the new employer costs assuming even if
 
01:40:06.750 --> 01:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
it was at 250 million which will likely
 
01:40:08.550 --> 01:40:08.560 align:start position:0%
be lower than that what would what would
 
01:40:11.149 --> 01:40:11.159 align:start position:0%
be the employer take now um so the the
 
01:40:12.390 --> 01:40:12.400 align:start position:0%
employers would pay at their true
 
01:40:15.229 --> 01:40:15.239 align:start position:0%
experience rate so um right now you get
 
01:40:17.070 --> 01:40:17.080 align:start position:0%
that reduction whatever the fund balance
 
01:40:18.830 --> 01:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
reduction uh dictates so right now
 
01:40:21.229 --> 01:40:21.239 align:start position:0%
they're getting that 1% reduction so you
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
look at our the the table that had the
 
01:40:25.669 --> 01:40:25.679 align:start position:0%
average rate of
 
01:40:30.750 --> 01:40:30.760 align:start position:0%
0.57 right now um if you remove that FBR
 
01:40:32.510 --> 01:40:32.520 align:start position:0%
those employers would be at
 
01:40:34.750 --> 01:40:34.760 align:start position:0%
1.57 uh right now would be that average
 
01:40:37.750 --> 01:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
rate okay so then and and a new employer
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
they come in at 2.7 and then get
 
01:40:42.709 --> 01:40:42.719 align:start position:0%
adjusted based on the FBR for those
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
first four quarters so they would be at
 
01:40:49.629 --> 01:40:49.639 align:start position:0%
2.7 so I so you would just take the if
 
01:40:50.750 --> 01:40:50.760 align:start position:0%
it was an existing employer you would
 
01:40:51.910 --> 01:40:51.920 align:start position:0%
just take the
 
01:40:54.589 --> 01:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
14,000 and just multiply it by I can't
 
01:40:56.109 --> 01:40:56.119 align:start position:0%
do the math in my head right now but
 
01:40:58.270 --> 01:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
1.5% and that's roughly what they'll pay
 
01:41:00.189 --> 01:41:00.199 align:start position:0%
per year uh per employee per year
 
01:41:04.109 --> 01:41:04.119 align:start position:0%
correct okay so it will increase the
 
01:41:06.149 --> 01:41:06.159 align:start position:0%
cost to an employer during a
 
01:41:08.990 --> 01:41:09.000 align:start position:0%
recession absolutely yes okay and that
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
doesn't include whatever their
 
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
experience rate
 
01:41:15.149 --> 01:41:15.159 align:start position:0%
might dictate over the course of the
 
01:41:17.109 --> 01:41:17.119 align:start position:0%
year if they have a lot of layoffs the
 
01:41:19.070 --> 01:41:19.080 align:start position:0%
next time it's determined determined
 
01:41:20.550 --> 01:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
annually they would their rate would go
 
01:41:24.589 --> 01:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
up as well okay thank you repr kale
 
01:41:27.070 --> 01:41:27.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you uh so
 
01:41:28.669 --> 01:41:28.679 align:start position:0%
if you're an employer that's not prone
 
01:41:30.430 --> 01:41:30.440 align:start position:0%
to layoffs you're probably going to be
 
01:41:32.669 --> 01:41:32.679 align:start position:0%
in pretty good shape even if this worst
 
01:41:34.790 --> 01:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
case scenario happens as far as your
 
01:41:38.669 --> 01:41:38.679 align:start position:0%
expenses a 1.5 time you know at for you
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
get 14% or
 
01:41:43.910 --> 01:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
14,000 right if so if you're an employer
 
01:41:46.310 --> 01:41:46.320 align:start position:0%
that regardless of the economic downturn
 
01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:48.679 align:start position:0%
you're not laying off individual so your
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
experience isn't going to um um get
 
01:41:53.070 --> 01:41:53.080 align:start position:0%
worse because there aren't benefits
 
01:41:56.070 --> 01:41:56.080 align:start position:0%
going out to your former employees um
 
01:41:58.589 --> 01:41:58.599 align:start position:0%
but your experience will might actually
 
01:41:59.669 --> 01:41:59.679 align:start position:0%
improve a little bit because you're
 
01:42:01.390 --> 01:42:01.400 align:start position:0%
going to have more taxes coming in if
 
01:42:03.669 --> 01:42:03.679 align:start position:0%
you're one of those that don't have any
 
01:42:05.390 --> 01:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
layoffs but you're going to lose the
 
01:42:07.950 --> 01:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
fund balance reduction so instead of
 
01:42:10.669 --> 01:42:10.679 align:start position:0%
paying at 0.57% you're going to be
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
triple that or close to Triple that at
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
1.57 uh perc on the first $144,000 per
 
01:42:21.070 --> 01:42:21.080 align:start position:0%
employee follow up and I I don't believe
 
01:42:23.229 --> 01:42:23.239 align:start position:0%
you're an accountant but I'll ask anyway
 
01:42:25.950 --> 01:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
so are all these expenses deductible you
 
01:42:30.109 --> 01:42:30.119 align:start position:0%
write them off against your uh B uh bet
 
01:42:32.750 --> 01:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
and the bft and your federal and
 
01:42:35.070 --> 01:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
everything else all these reduce your
 
01:42:38.790 --> 01:42:38.800 align:start position:0%
tax burden in a sense you another tax um
 
01:42:40.629 --> 01:42:40.639 align:start position:0%
I will defer to the Department of
 
01:42:42.709 --> 01:42:42.719 align:start position:0%
Revenue on BET and
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
BPT um deductions and impacts for
 
01:42:48.709 --> 01:42:48.719 align:start position:0%
purposes of our statute the employer is
 
01:42:51.830 --> 01:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
required to report all way AG is paid
 
01:42:55.470 --> 01:42:55.480 align:start position:0%
for each and every employee each quarter
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
and that and that's the amount that they
 
01:43:01.149 --> 01:43:01.159 align:start position:0%
are taxed upon and the amounts that then
 
01:43:03.229 --> 01:43:03.239 align:start position:0%
go into factoring into their experience
 
01:43:06.270 --> 01:43:06.280 align:start position:0%
rate thank
 
01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
you all right seeing no other questions
 
01:43:12.550 --> 01:43:12.560 align:start position:0%
we have one more oh I'm sorry I'm sorry
 
01:43:15.070 --> 01:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
a question for chair I have a lot of
 
01:43:17.870 --> 01:43:17.880 align:start position:0%
questions for gentl I have a lot of
 
01:43:20.470 --> 01:43:20.480 align:start position:0%
questions for um Mr laas and Mr go are
 
01:43:22.070 --> 01:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
they be testifying on the next R because
 
01:43:23.910 --> 01:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
I don't want this to run late because it
 
01:43:26.470 --> 01:43:26.480 align:start position:0%
it will be in in depth delve into the
 
01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:31.990 align:start position:0%
it will be in in depth delve into the
trust

01:43:31.990 --> 01:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:35.550 --> 01:43:35.560 align:start position:0%
fund well I can't go to the next one and
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
then come back and ask
 
01:43:37.360 --> 01:43:39.470 align:start position:0%
then come back and ask
questions

01:43:39.470 --> 01:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:43:42.750 --> 01:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
um I clarify yes testimon be the same on
 
01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:44.709 align:start position:0%
um I clarify yes testimon be the same on
the

01:43:44.709 --> 01:43:44.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:43:47.669 --> 01:43:47.679 align:start position:0%
next somewhat but not a lot it really
 
01:43:49.589 --> 01:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
has to do with how much money you can
 
01:43:53.629 --> 01:43:53.639 align:start position:0%
earn so so um why don't you take uh we
 
01:43:56.669 --> 01:43:56.679 align:start position:0%
have one more speaker why don't you
 
01:43:59.310 --> 01:43:59.320 align:start position:0%
take yeah had a few of
 
01:44:02.790 --> 01:44:02.800 align:start position:0%
these if I feel that they're droning on
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
I will let you ask them privately okay
 
01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman again thank you
 
01:44:09.870 --> 01:44:09.880 align:start position:0%
Mr labors and Mr gotot Le um as we've
 
01:44:12.390 --> 01:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
seen over the trust fund from since um I
 
01:44:17.589 --> 01:44:17.599 align:start position:0%
look at 2011 and 2020 as being outliers
 
01:44:19.709 --> 01:44:19.719 align:start position:0%
um if we increase benefits the duration
 
01:44:21.669 --> 01:44:21.679 align:start position:0%
will increase the costs increased
 
01:44:23.830 --> 01:44:23.840 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance would increase
 
01:44:25.270 --> 01:44:25.280 align:start position:0%
the trust fund balance would obviously
 
01:44:27.870 --> 01:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
have to be increased in order to absor
 
01:44:30.510 --> 01:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
to take that initial hit of unemployment
 
01:44:33.390 --> 01:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
claims in another recession um can you
 
01:44:35.229 --> 01:44:35.239 align:start position:0%
explain the balance between the positive
 
01:44:37.790 --> 01:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
and negative and how that would impact
 
01:44:40.550 --> 01:44:40.560 align:start position:0%
um positive um UI Insurance payers and
 
01:44:42.550 --> 01:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
negative UI Insurance payers and what
 
01:44:44.669 --> 01:44:44.679 align:start position:0%
the rates could look like if it went to
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
a $500 million trust fund in order to
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
not drop below the 100 million that in
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:51.229 align:start position:0%
not drop below the 100 million that in
your

01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
your
 
01:44:52.470 --> 01:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
graphs here I mean it's it's a little
 
01:44:54.790 --> 01:44:54.800 align:start position:0%
bit involved but I it's a question
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
that's been rotating around thank
 
01:45:00.030 --> 01:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
you um yes
 
01:45:03.270 --> 01:45:03.280 align:start position:0%
so if Ben if the amount of benefits
 
01:45:07.229 --> 01:45:07.239 align:start position:0%
being paid out uh increases then that is
 
01:45:09.870 --> 01:45:09.880 align:start position:0%
um applied against your experience rate
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
that's a that's a negative on your
 
01:45:14.910 --> 01:45:14.920 align:start position:0%
experience um so your overall experience
 
01:45:18.070 --> 01:45:18.080 align:start position:0%
rate is going to be going up the way
 
01:45:20.270 --> 01:45:20.280 align:start position:0%
that New Hampshire sets that right now
 
01:45:23.510 --> 01:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
is is we we have three tables that are
 
01:45:26.109 --> 01:45:26.119 align:start position:0%
in the unemployment compensation statute
 
01:45:28.350 --> 01:45:28.360 align:start position:0%
so the first table with the lower rates
 
01:45:30.870 --> 01:45:30.880 align:start position:0%
the lowest rates the lowest of which
 
01:45:32.669 --> 01:45:32.679 align:start position:0%
that you can pay at is
 
01:45:36.109 --> 01:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
0.1% um that is the table for positive
 
01:45:38.709 --> 01:45:38.719 align:start position:0%
rated employers um so representative
 
01:45:40.189 --> 01:45:40.199 align:start position:0%
avalani had talked about positive and
 
01:45:42.270 --> 01:45:42.280 align:start position:0%
negative so positive rated employers are
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
those that have paid in more in taxes
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
into the program then that we have paid
 
01:45:48.830 --> 01:45:48.840 align:start position:0%
out in benefits to their former
 
01:45:51.550 --> 01:45:51.560 align:start position:0%
employees um they are less of a risk to
 
01:45:53.589 --> 01:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
the trust fund therefore they are
 
01:45:56.430 --> 01:45:56.440 align:start position:0%
provided with the lowest tax rates the
 
01:45:59.189 --> 01:45:59.199 align:start position:0%
next table is for those employers that
 
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
are newly negative so if you are
 
01:46:05.629 --> 01:46:05.639 align:start position:0%
negative rated for less than four years
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
then say you had um uh disruption um to
 
01:46:12.709 --> 01:46:12.719 align:start position:0%
uh your supply chain something that
 
01:46:15.390 --> 01:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
caused you to have to lay off a portion
 
01:46:18.470 --> 01:46:18.480 align:start position:0%
of your Workforce that causes you to go
 
01:46:20.109 --> 01:46:20.119 align:start position:0%
into the point of being negative where
 
01:46:22.310 --> 01:46:22.320 align:start position:0%
now we have paid out more in
 
01:46:23.870 --> 01:46:23.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits to your former
 
01:46:27.149 --> 01:46:27.159 align:start position:0%
employees than you have paid in in taxes
 
01:46:29.550 --> 01:46:29.560 align:start position:0%
you go to table two in the statute with
 
01:46:32.629 --> 01:46:32.639 align:start position:0%
slightly higher rates and then for those
 
01:46:34.149 --> 01:46:34.159 align:start position:0%
that are chronically negative so
 
01:46:36.910 --> 01:46:36.920 align:start position:0%
negative for more than four years those
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
that really have seasonal patterns to
 
01:46:40.990 --> 01:46:41.000 align:start position:0%
their hiring and firing uh those
 
01:46:43.870 --> 01:46:43.880 align:start position:0%
employers pay at the highest uh the
 
01:46:46.030 --> 01:46:46.040 align:start position:0%
rates at the highest table uh with the
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
experience rate there the maximum is
 
01:46:51.790 --> 01:46:51.800 align:start position:0%
7% um additionally a negative rated
 
01:46:54.910 --> 01:46:54.920 align:start position:0%
employer does have sear charges um that
 
01:46:57.390 --> 01:46:57.400 align:start position:0%
kick in they they're an inverse SE
 
01:47:00.470 --> 01:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
charge so they work um opposite of the
 
01:47:02.430 --> 01:47:02.440 align:start position:0%
fund balance reductions for positive
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
rated employers so when the fund is
 
01:47:09.070 --> 01:47:09.080 align:start position:0%
below 250 million and positive rated
 
01:47:10.950 --> 01:47:10.960 align:start position:0%
employers are paying at their experience
 
01:47:13.189 --> 01:47:13.199 align:start position:0%
rate they don't get any reduction those
 
01:47:15.229 --> 01:47:15.239 align:start position:0%
negative rated employers get a 1 and a
 
01:47:17.790 --> 01:47:17.800 align:start position:0%
half% inverse search charge on their
 
01:47:20.910 --> 01:47:20.920 align:start position:0%
rate as the fund goes up and positive
 
01:47:23.629 --> 01:47:23.639 align:start position:0%
rated employers see their rates go down
 
01:47:26.709 --> 01:47:26.719 align:start position:0%
with the fund balance uh reduction those
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
negative rated employers get less of a
 
01:47:31.750 --> 01:47:31.760 align:start position:0%
sech charge added onto their rate and
 
01:47:34.189 --> 01:47:34.199 align:start position:0%
when we're at that $400 million Mark
 
01:47:36.830 --> 01:47:36.840 align:start position:0%
they have zero sirch charge and the
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
positive rated employers have the 1 and
 
01:47:41.070 --> 01:47:41.080 align:start position:0%
a half% maximum
 
01:47:43.270 --> 01:47:43.280 align:start position:0%
reduction so when you're not hitting
 
01:47:46.629 --> 01:47:46.639 align:start position:0%
those those thresholds in the trust fund
 
01:47:48.109 --> 01:47:48.119 align:start position:0%
that means that the fund balance
 
01:47:50.550 --> 01:47:50.560 align:start position:0%
reductions are not being met with which
 
01:47:53.270 --> 01:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
then increases rates and when you have
 
01:47:55.550 --> 01:47:55.560 align:start position:0%
more being paid out in benefits you're
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
going to have a negative impact on
 
01:47:59.350 --> 01:47:59.360 align:start position:0%
experience which will result in higher
 
01:48:02.950 --> 01:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
rate higher rates and higher taxes as
 
01:48:05.629 --> 01:48:05.639 align:start position:0%
well and a quick followup yes sir thank
 
01:48:08.189 --> 01:48:08.199 align:start position:0%
you and thank you for the followup um so
 
01:48:09.950 --> 01:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
when the trust fund balance reaches a
 
01:48:12.550 --> 01:48:12.560 align:start position:0%
certain level uh in law it does an
 
01:48:15.910 --> 01:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
automatic increase to employers say and
 
01:48:17.629 --> 01:48:17.639 align:start position:0%
but all employers pay that increase no
 
01:48:19.510 --> 01:48:19.520 align:start position:0%
matter what whether their experience is
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
positive or negative if we hit we get
 
01:48:24.229 --> 01:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
sorry the employeers get hit with this
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
trigger this trigger this trigger which
 
01:48:27.910 --> 01:48:27.920 align:start position:0%
could in turn obviously if we have a
 
01:48:30.589 --> 01:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
larger swing in our model for um
 
01:48:33.470 --> 01:48:33.480 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits at with using this
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
we would see a lot of those triggers
 
01:48:38.589 --> 01:48:38.599 align:start position:0%
happening on a slow year or even on a
 
01:48:41.510 --> 01:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
large year large unemployment year those
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
swings would be very large for unemploy
 
01:48:46.510 --> 01:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
for employers to catch up on if let's
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
say it happens in the third quarter and
 
01:48:49.189 --> 01:48:49.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of them have already paid into
 
01:48:51.070 --> 01:48:51.080 align:start position:0%
their thing come the first quarter of
 
01:48:52.189 --> 01:48:52.199 align:start position:0%
the following year there's going to be a
 
01:48:53.589 --> 01:48:53.599 align:start position:0%
large increase in their unemployment
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
insurance benefits uninsurance payments
 
01:48:58.669 --> 01:48:58.679 align:start position:0%
and and and though the the fund balance
 
01:49:00.629 --> 01:49:00.639 align:start position:0%
reductions They do change from quarter
 
01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
to quarter um it's usually for the the
 
01:49:05.350 --> 01:49:05.360 align:start position:0%
benefit of the employer right because
 
01:49:06.669 --> 01:49:06.679 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a reduction to your
 
01:49:10.510 --> 01:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
experience rate um and I know the um tax
 
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
Foundation dings New Hampshire every
 
01:49:14.070 --> 01:49:14.080 align:start position:0%
year when they give their ratings for
 
01:49:15.830 --> 01:49:15.840 align:start position:0%
the the tax climate of the state because
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
it can change quarter to quarter even
 
01:49:18.910 --> 01:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
though it's usually to the benefit of
 
01:49:20.629 --> 01:49:20.639 align:start position:0%
the employer they don't like it
 
01:49:23.790 --> 01:49:23.800 align:start position:0%
um I disagree with them Brian and I have
 
01:49:27.550 --> 01:49:27.560 align:start position:0%
talked with them um uh but so we look in
 
01:49:29.070 --> 01:49:29.080 align:start position:0%
order to determine that fund balance
 
01:49:30.950 --> 01:49:30.960 align:start position:0%
reduction you're always looking at the
 
01:49:33.229 --> 01:49:33.239 align:start position:0%
prior quarters daily balance in the
 
01:49:35.629 --> 01:49:35.639 align:start position:0%
trust fund so we track the daily balance
 
01:49:37.950 --> 01:49:37.960 align:start position:0%
we don't forecast the daily balance but
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
we track the daily balance and as long
 
01:49:42.109 --> 01:49:42.119 align:start position:0%
as the daily balance for the prior
 
01:49:46.350 --> 01:49:46.360 align:start position:0%
quarter um equal or exceeded $250
 
01:49:49.109 --> 01:49:49.119 align:start position:0%
million that subsequent quarter
 
01:49:51.189 --> 01:49:51.199 align:start position:0%
employers get that point .5 reduction or
 
01:49:54.629 --> 01:49:54.639 align:start position:0%
that 0.1 or that 1.0 reduction if it's
 
01:49:57.950 --> 01:49:57.960 align:start position:0%
350 million and that 1.5 reduction if
 
01:50:01.350 --> 01:50:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's 400 million now it's quarter by
 
01:50:03.189 --> 01:50:03.199 align:start position:0%
quarter so it can change quarter by
 
01:50:05.390 --> 01:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
quarter right now we've been in a a
 
01:50:09.270 --> 01:50:09.280 align:start position:0%
pretty uh constant state of 1% 1% 1%
 
01:50:12.870 --> 01:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
reductions quarter to quarter um but it
 
01:50:14.669 --> 01:50:14.679 align:start position:0%
does we do inform employers at the end
 
01:50:16.910 --> 01:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
of each quarter um what that rate is
 
01:50:19.109 --> 01:50:19.119 align:start position:0%
going to be what what FBR is in effect
 
01:50:21.390 --> 01:50:21.400 align:start position:0%
for that next quarter goes out with the
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
the uh their their tax rates in their um
 
01:50:26.189 --> 01:50:26.199 align:start position:0%
tax reports when they go out thank you
 
01:50:28.990 --> 01:50:29.000 align:start position:0%

sorry all right so good morning Mr
 
01:51:06.709 --> 01:51:06.719 align:start position:0%
chairman members of the committee my
 
01:51:09.189 --> 01:51:09.199 align:start position:0%
name is David peler I live in dumart New
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm the business manager of
 
01:51:13.750 --> 01:51:13.760 align:start position:0%
plumbers and pip Fitters Local 131 and a
 
01:51:15.030 --> 01:51:15.040 align:start position:0%
representative of the New Hampshire
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
building and construction trades and I'm
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
here in support of help Bill
 
01:51:22.239 --> 01:51:24.629 align:start position:0%
here in support of help Bill
1522

01:51:24.629 --> 01:51:24.639 align:start position:0%
1522
 
01:51:28.470 --> 01:51:28.480 align:start position:0%
um I I certainly uh don't envy the work
 
01:51:29.750 --> 01:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to have to do because this
 
01:51:31.990 --> 01:51:32.000 align:start position:0%
is an incredibly
 
01:51:35.189 --> 01:51:35.199 align:start position:0%
complicated um issue that you're dealing
 
01:51:37.470 --> 01:51:37.480 align:start position:0%
with here but I can tell you from the
 
01:51:39.310 --> 01:51:39.320 align:start position:0%
perspective of my members and the
 
01:51:42.030 --> 01:51:42.040 align:start position:0%
members of the other Building Trades you
 
01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:44.040 align:start position:0%
know filing for unemployment
 
01:51:47.149 --> 01:51:47.159 align:start position:0%
compensation is is something that you
 
01:51:49.550 --> 01:51:49.560 align:start position:0%
know you have to do from time to time
 
01:51:52.950 --> 01:51:52.960 align:start position:0%
jobs end uh people get laid off through
 
01:51:55.390 --> 01:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
no fault of their own they file for
 
01:51:57.270 --> 01:51:57.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment compensation and the
 
01:51:59.470 --> 01:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
current rate of
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
1427 that we heard for the last 17 years
 
01:52:03.990 --> 01:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
it's just it's
 
01:52:08.069 --> 01:52:08.079 align:start position:0%
insufficient um you know that that 1427
 
01:52:10.990 --> 01:52:11.000 align:start position:0%
equates the 1708 a month with current
 
01:52:13.189 --> 01:52:13.199 align:start position:0%
rates in the state of New Hampshire at
 
01:52:16.669 --> 01:52:16.679 align:start position:0%
$1,500 a month and up I mean how can how
 
01:52:19.390 --> 01:52:19.400 align:start position:0%
can we expect people to pay their bills
 
01:52:21.589 --> 01:52:21.599 align:start position:0%
uh you know know support their families
 
01:52:23.470 --> 01:52:23.480 align:start position:0%
pay insurance pay for
 
01:52:27.390 --> 01:52:27.400 align:start position:0%
utilities um it it's just it just can't
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
be done so in effect what we're what
 
01:52:32.589 --> 01:52:32.599 align:start position:0%
we're doing and I see it with my members
 
01:52:33.830 --> 01:52:33.840 align:start position:0%
and other Building Trades
 
01:52:35.990 --> 01:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
Representatives see with their members
 
01:52:38.109 --> 01:52:38.119 align:start position:0%
our members you know they don't want to
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
collect unemployment to regardless but
 
01:52:43.109 --> 01:52:43.119 align:start position:0%
when they have to I have members who
 
01:52:45.790 --> 01:52:45.800 align:start position:0%
don't want to work out of state and and
 
01:52:47.589 --> 01:52:47.599 align:start position:0%
this just happened two weeks ago I had a
 
01:52:50.189 --> 01:52:50.199 align:start position:0%
member got got laid off from a job at at
 
01:52:50.199 --> 01:52:51.470 align:start position:0%
member got got laid off from a job at at
lonza

01:52:51.470 --> 01:52:51.480 align:start position:0%
lonza
 
01:52:54.310 --> 01:52:54.320 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical he called up you know I
 
01:52:55.790 --> 01:52:55.800 align:start position:0%
I'm looking to work here in New
 
01:52:58.550 --> 01:52:58.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um so I don't even want to go
 
01:53:00.470 --> 01:53:00.480 align:start position:0%
down to Massachusetts well three weeks
 
01:53:03.470 --> 01:53:03.480 align:start position:0%
later I mean he saying you know I can't
 
01:53:05.589 --> 01:53:05.599 align:start position:0%
afford I gotta pay for my rent I'm
 
01:53:07.750 --> 01:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
married I got a kid I I got to go to
 
01:53:10.990 --> 01:53:11.000 align:start position:0%
work they go to Massachusetts I have
 
01:53:12.750 --> 01:53:12.760 align:start position:0%
personally with the plumbers and pipe
 
01:53:15.750 --> 01:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
fitters we have 50 some members working
 
01:53:20.270 --> 01:53:20.280 align:start position:0%
down there and once they go there um you
 
01:53:24.229 --> 01:53:24.239 align:start position:0%
know we we the commute is awful the
 
01:53:27.550 --> 01:53:27.560 align:start position:0%
hours you know aren't good but the
 
01:53:29.390 --> 01:53:29.400 align:start position:0%
amount of money they make over the New
 
01:53:31.990 --> 01:53:32.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire scale you know for my trade
 
01:53:36.069 --> 01:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
alone is $20 an hour and then once they
 
01:53:38.669 --> 01:53:38.679 align:start position:0%
get laid off down there you we've heard
 
01:53:41.069 --> 01:53:41.079 align:start position:0%
what their unemployment rate is they end
 
01:53:43.470 --> 01:53:43.480 align:start position:0%
up saying you know what I'll just wait
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
for another job down here I can't make
 
01:53:47.709 --> 01:53:47.719 align:start position:0%
it in New Hampshire anymore and we get
 
01:53:49.310 --> 01:53:49.320 align:start position:0%
more and more workers crossing the
 
01:53:53.470 --> 01:53:53.480 align:start position:0%
border every day um you know and
 
01:53:57.030 --> 01:53:57.040 align:start position:0%
certainly increasing the unemployment U
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
amount is not going to make workers stay
 
01:54:01.550 --> 01:54:01.560 align:start position:0%
here but it I I believe it will help and
 
01:54:03.990 --> 01:54:04.000 align:start position:0%
it'll help with workers who are here and
 
01:54:07.589 --> 01:54:07.599 align:start position:0%
want to be here um you know support
 
01:54:10.109 --> 01:54:10.119 align:start position:0%

that
 
01:55:05.069 --> 01:55:05.079 align:start position:0%
spoke I
 
01:55:08.589 --> 01:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
know still I need
 
01:55:14.229 --> 01:55:14.239 align:start position:0%

thank you MERS of the committee this is
 
01:55:24.430 --> 01:55:24.440 align:start position:0%
my very first presentation for any sort
 
01:55:28.669 --> 01:55:28.679 align:start position:0%
of bill so uh be nice to me I guess um
 
01:55:31.750 --> 01:55:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay so this bill obviously related to
 
01:55:33.270 --> 01:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
what you guys just talked to in the pr
 
01:55:34.790 --> 01:55:34.800 align:start position:0%
talked about in the previous bill but
 
01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.040 align:start position:0%
it's it's a little bit different so I
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
actually stumbled across this problem by
 
01:55:41.430 --> 01:55:41.440 align:start position:0%
getting laid off at the beginning of
 
01:55:44.750 --> 01:55:44.760 align:start position:0%
last year um or the beginning of 200
 
01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
yeah last year I I I got on to
 
01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
unemployment for the first time and
 
01:55:53.229 --> 01:55:53.239 align:start position:0%
through that process I discovered things
 
01:55:56.550 --> 01:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
that I think are unfortunate and a
 
01:55:58.350 --> 01:55:58.360 align:start position:0%
disincentive to getting people back to
 
01:56:01.109 --> 01:56:01.119 align:start position:0%
work so that led to me the motivation to
 
01:56:03.350 --> 01:56:03.360 align:start position:0%
me putting in this bill
 
01:56:06.990 --> 01:56:07.000 align:start position:0%
so when I I do I'm an economist and I do
 
01:56:11.350 --> 01:56:11.360 align:start position:0%
Consulting and I believe heavily in in
 
01:56:13.149 --> 01:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
incentives and incentives to get people
 
01:56:14.910 --> 01:56:14.920 align:start position:0%
back to work is sort of the driving
 
01:56:17.990 --> 01:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
force behind this bill so when I was uh
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
working at this company and then I got
 
01:56:22.589 --> 01:56:22.599 align:start position:0%
laid off I didn't have enough time to
 
01:56:23.950 --> 01:56:23.960 align:start position:0%
really get enough Consulting to support
 
01:56:26.229 --> 01:56:26.239 align:start position:0%
myself and I was on unemployment and
 
01:56:28.669 --> 01:56:28.679 align:start position:0%
then I would get periodic Consulting
 
01:56:30.189 --> 01:56:30.199 align:start position:0%
contracts and you got to declare
 
01:56:33.149 --> 01:56:33.159 align:start position:0%
whatever income you earn and so what I
 
01:56:35.430 --> 01:56:35.440 align:start position:0%
quickly realized was in the way the
 
01:56:39.390 --> 01:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
structure is currently if you do work
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
while like part-time you know I I had
 
01:56:43.870 --> 01:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
one contract that was like 12 hours and
 
01:56:45.790 --> 01:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
it quickly put me over what I would make
 
01:56:47.910 --> 01:56:47.920 align:start position:0%
in this and I just I just got kicked out
 
01:56:50.189 --> 01:56:50.199 align:start position:0%
of the program um and had to go through
 
01:56:53.669 --> 01:56:53.679 align:start position:0%
the refiling process but and that's fine
 
01:56:55.189 --> 01:56:55.199 align:start position:0%
if you're making more than what you get
 
01:56:58.270 --> 01:56:58.280 align:start position:0%
then that doesn't bother me as much as
 
01:57:01.350 --> 01:57:01.360 align:start position:0%
if you work and you go beyond the 30% um
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
allowed wages before you start losing
 
01:57:06.229 --> 01:57:06.239 align:start position:0%
some of your benefits you're actually
 
01:57:08.390 --> 01:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
have zero incentive once you hit that
 
01:57:12.149 --> 01:57:12.159 align:start position:0%
that 30% of what your benefits are that
 
01:57:13.830 --> 01:57:13.840 align:start position:0%
to me doesn't feel right and and the
 
01:57:15.470 --> 01:57:15.480 align:start position:0%
reason it doesn't feel right is for
 
01:57:17.149 --> 01:57:17.159 align:start position:0%
example sometimes when I when I don't
 
01:57:18.950 --> 01:57:18.960 align:start position:0%
have Consulting work I'll do I'll do
 
01:57:21.510 --> 01:57:21.520 align:start position:0%
substitute teaching which is about $90 a
 
01:57:24.709 --> 01:57:24.719 align:start position:0%
day so if I if I did I had the maximum
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
amount which was what $427 or something
 
01:57:30.830 --> 01:57:30.840 align:start position:0%
so if I did two days of Consulting I was
 
01:57:32.350 --> 01:57:32.360 align:start position:0%
actually worse off than if I just did
 
01:57:33.790 --> 01:57:33.800 align:start position:0%
one not Consulting of substitute
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
teaching than if I just did one day of
 
01:57:38.109 --> 01:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
substitute teaching because they take
 
01:57:40.109 --> 01:57:40.119 align:start position:0%
off that full $90 but there's obviously
 
01:57:41.589 --> 01:57:41.599 align:start position:0%
taxes taken out and I spent the whole
 
01:57:44.149 --> 01:57:44.159 align:start position:0%
day working and my and it's just dollar
 
01:57:46.069 --> 01:57:46.079 align:start position:0%
for dollar taken off of my unemployment
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
benefits so that to me is is a problem
 
01:57:52.390 --> 01:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
so I I've changed the thing the the bill
 
01:57:54.109 --> 01:57:54.119 align:start position:0%
and the amendment that I passed around
 
01:57:56.950 --> 01:57:56.960 align:start position:0%
to you guys uh the initial bill I'm sure
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
you've all experienced it if you put in
 
01:57:59.510 --> 01:57:59.520 align:start position:0%
Bill sometimes it's a little Lost in
 
01:58:02.669 --> 01:58:02.679 align:start position:0%
Translation with OS and and um so it
 
01:58:03.669 --> 01:58:03.679 align:start position:0%
ended up being a little bit more
 
01:58:05.069 --> 01:58:05.079 align:start position:0%
complicated what you guys got than what
 
01:58:07.470 --> 01:58:07.480 align:start position:0%
I intended and so I got this revision so
 
01:58:08.550 --> 01:58:08.560 align:start position:0%
it's really the only thing that's
 
01:58:10.229 --> 01:58:10.239 align:start position:0%
different from this amendment from the
 
01:58:12.790 --> 01:58:12.800 align:start position:0%
actual bill that you guys have seen is
 
01:58:14.350 --> 01:58:14.360 align:start position:0%
at the top of the actual bill there was
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
a bunch of stuff like crossed out that's
 
01:58:19.149 --> 01:58:19.159 align:start position:0%
back in I wasn't trying to change any of
 
01:58:20.990 --> 01:58:21.000 align:start position:0%
that I was just trying to change the
 
01:58:24.030 --> 01:58:24.040 align:start position:0%
formula so the formula now reads all
 
01:58:26.669 --> 01:58:26.679 align:start position:0%
wages and earnings in excess of 30%
 
01:58:28.589 --> 01:58:28.599 align:start position:0%
rounded to nearest Dollar of the
 
01:58:31.030 --> 01:58:31.040 align:start position:0%
individual's weekly benefit will be
 
01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
deducted from from your unemployment
 
01:58:38.149 --> 01:58:38.159 align:start position:0%
benefit I change that to 40% of of any
 
01:58:39.870 --> 01:58:39.880 align:start position:0%
earned wages rounded to the nearest
 
01:58:43.390 --> 01:58:43.400 align:start position:0%
Dollar so if we have let's say you're
 
01:58:46.750 --> 01:58:46.760 align:start position:0%
making for simple math $300 a week in
 
01:58:50.510 --> 01:58:50.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits and you earn1 $100
 
01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
just for easy math you get to keep
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
pretty much all of that money right but
 
01:58:56.270 --> 01:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
if you earn
 
01:58:59.189 --> 01:58:59.199 align:start position:0%
$200 you a 100 of it will be taken off
 
01:59:00.189 --> 01:59:00.199 align:start position:0%
of your
 
01:59:02.830 --> 01:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
$300 under this formula we would be
 
01:59:06.470 --> 01:59:06.480 align:start position:0%
taking off 40% of that $200 so 80 $80
 
01:59:08.390 --> 01:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
would be deducted so you're actually a
 
01:59:11.350 --> 01:59:11.360 align:start position:0%
little bit better which I think um is it
 
01:59:13.390 --> 01:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
representative Mason or no represent
 
01:59:15.669 --> 01:59:15.679 align:start position:0%
love you you sort of had this idea do we
 
01:59:17.669 --> 01:59:17.679 align:start position:0%
change the the formula and that's what I
 
01:59:19.589 --> 01:59:19.599 align:start position:0%
was getting at because to me it seems a
 
01:59:21.229 --> 01:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
I was coming from somebody who I was
 
01:59:23.310 --> 01:59:23.320 align:start position:0%
only getting single percentage
 
01:59:26.390 --> 01:59:26.400 align:start position:0%
percentage um of my income in the
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
unemployment and so if I could have
 
01:59:30.189 --> 01:59:30.199 align:start position:0%
worked a little bit more and got some
 
01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
and kept a little bit higher share of my
 
01:59:32.990 --> 01:59:33.000 align:start position:0%
unemployment it would have been great
 
01:59:34.109 --> 01:59:34.119 align:start position:0%
for me if somebody was a high income
 
01:59:36.709 --> 01:59:36.719 align:start position:0%
earner when I got when I got unemployed
 
01:59:39.030 --> 01:59:39.040 align:start position:0%
but I also think it's important because
 
01:59:41.510 --> 01:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
if you can get somebody doing regular un
 
01:59:44.350 --> 01:59:44.360 align:start position:0%
um part-time work then that's how you
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
get your foot in the door a lot of times
 
01:59:47.550 --> 01:59:47.560 align:start position:0%
to getting a job and that was one of my
 
01:59:48.709 --> 01:59:48.719 align:start position:0%
thinkings like when I was doing
 
01:59:50.069 --> 01:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
substitute teaching teaching one of the
 
01:59:51.950 --> 01:59:51.960 align:start position:0%
full-time teachers that's how he got
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
into teaching at that school district is
 
01:59:55.310 --> 01:59:55.320 align:start position:0%
because he had been a substitute for the
 
01:59:56.870 --> 01:59:56.880 align:start position:0%
whole year working essentially as a
 
01:59:58.830 --> 01:59:58.840 align:start position:0%
full-time substitute but he started the
 
02:00:00.910 --> 02:00:00.920 align:start position:0%
process by losing his job and said well
 
02:00:02.069 --> 02:00:02.079 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do substitute teaching
 
02:00:03.709 --> 02:00:03.719 align:start position:0%
discovered he liked it was a good fit
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
with the school they hired him on the
 
02:00:08.589 --> 02:00:08.599 align:start position:0%
next year and so I think if there's a
 
02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:11.480 align:start position:0%
disincentive to work because you are you
 
02:00:13.990 --> 02:00:14.000 align:start position:0%
you work till you get to that 30% and
 
02:00:15.270 --> 02:00:15.280 align:start position:0%
then you have no incentive to work
 
02:00:17.430 --> 02:00:17.440 align:start position:0%
anymore then you're going to miss out on
 
02:00:18.830 --> 02:00:18.840 align:start position:0%
some of these people who a could help us
 
02:00:20.350 --> 02:00:20.360 align:start position:0%
with the labor CR crunch that we're
 
02:00:22.470 --> 02:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
currently dealing with and B get their
 
02:00:23.950 --> 02:00:23.960 align:start position:0%
foot in the door to an employer that
 
02:00:25.109 --> 02:00:25.119 align:start position:0%
they like wow I never knew I was going
 
02:00:26.310 --> 02:00:26.320 align:start position:0%
to like being a teacher like in that
 
02:00:28.589 --> 02:00:28.599 align:start position:0%
example I just told you about and uh
 
02:00:30.270 --> 02:00:30.280 align:start position:0%
This Is A New Path a new career path for
 
02:00:31.550 --> 02:00:31.560 align:start position:0%
me and hopefully they'll get out of the
 
02:00:36.069 --> 02:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
unemployment role a little bit faster um
 
02:00:37.750 --> 02:00:37.760 align:start position:0%
so that's sort of the logic that's my
 
02:00:40.750 --> 02:00:40.760 align:start position:0%
story um I recognized that and I spoke
 
02:00:43.310 --> 02:00:43.320 align:start position:0%
with the Labor uh Security Commission
 
02:00:46.069 --> 02:00:46.079 align:start position:0%
about this bill before writing it and
 
02:00:47.750 --> 02:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
and we both acknowledge that it's really
 
02:00:49.229 --> 02:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
hard to model how this is going to
 
02:00:52.390 --> 02:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
impact the employment trust fund the the
 
02:00:54.790 --> 02:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
assumptions are the key here and so if
 
02:00:56.430 --> 02:00:56.440 align:start position:0%
you operate under the assumption that
 
02:01:00.069 --> 02:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
more people will work beyond the 30%
 
02:01:01.910 --> 02:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
then that's actually a good thing
 
02:01:03.830 --> 02:01:03.840 align:start position:0%
because we're going to have more people
 
02:01:05.950 --> 02:01:05.960 align:start position:0%
earning money which would continue to
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
drive down the amount that we're paying
 
02:01:10.629 --> 02:01:10.639 align:start position:0%
out um if you under if you operate under
 
02:01:13.069 --> 02:01:13.079 align:start position:0%
the assumption that people don't really
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
react to that 30% then then maybe it
 
02:01:17.510 --> 02:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
would be a bad thing it really just
 
02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
depends in terms from the the balance of
 
02:01:21.189 --> 02:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
the trust fund it's really depends on
 
02:01:23.109 --> 02:01:23.119 align:start position:0%
the Assumption and I don't think we
 
02:01:27.069 --> 02:01:27.079 align:start position:0%
really know until we actually try it but
 
02:01:28.750 --> 02:01:28.760 align:start position:0%
I hope that you'll consider this bill I
 
02:01:30.709 --> 02:01:30.719 align:start position:0%
think it's a good idea happen to take
 
02:01:32.830 --> 02:01:32.840 align:start position:0%
questions but I'd leave you with the
 
02:01:34.629 --> 02:01:34.639 align:start position:0%
idea that I think we can it shouldn't be
 
02:01:37.390 --> 02:01:37.400 align:start position:0%
that controversial that creating an
 
02:01:39.350 --> 02:01:39.360 align:start position:0%
incentive to get more people working is
 
02:01:42.030 --> 02:01:42.040 align:start position:0%
generally a good thing and it's going to
 
02:01:43.830 --> 02:01:43.840 align:start position:0%
help those people as well because if if
 
02:01:45.709 --> 02:01:45.719 align:start position:0%
you're somebody like myself who was
 
02:01:49.030 --> 02:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
replacing maybe 8% of my previous income
 
02:01:51.030 --> 02:01:51.040 align:start position:0%
getting some unemployment in addition to
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
be able to work and and get a little bit
 
02:01:54.390 --> 02:01:54.400 align:start position:0%
more than what my unemployment would
 
02:01:57.270 --> 02:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
have been is probably uh good for the
 
02:01:59.350 --> 02:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
the person on unemployment as well so
 
02:02:01.550 --> 02:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
with that I'll take any questions all
 
02:02:03.990 --> 02:02:04.000 align:start position:0%
right thank you are there
 
02:02:06.510 --> 02:02:06.520 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:02:08.550 --> 02:02:08.560 align:start position:0%
avani thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:02:11.270 --> 02:02:11.280 align:start position:0%
you representative solivan um it's on
 
02:02:13.430 --> 02:02:13.440 align:start position:0%
line 16 to 17 instead of just crossing
 
02:02:15.030 --> 02:02:15.040 align:start position:0%
out all wages and earnings why don't we
 
02:02:15.950 --> 02:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
just put
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
40% in there and be done
 
02:02:22.950 --> 02:02:22.960 align:start position:0%
why was why why are we deleting other
 
02:02:26.550 --> 02:02:26.560 align:start position:0%
lines words prior to and prior after so
 
02:02:29.470 --> 02:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
yeah so the stuff that's deleted on top
 
02:02:31.870 --> 02:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
are you talking about the amendment okay
 
02:02:34.030 --> 02:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
yeah so that's just the the what's
 
02:02:35.589 --> 02:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
deleted is the current language we need
 
02:02:37.189 --> 02:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
to replace the current language with the
 
02:02:37.199 --> 02:02:41.470 align:start position:0%
to replace the current language with the
bolded

02:02:41.470 --> 02:02:41.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:44.709 --> 02:02:44.719 align:start position:0%
40% if I may clarify your
 
02:02:47.229 --> 02:02:47.239 align:start position:0%
question I I think what you're trying to
 
02:02:50.910 --> 02:02:50.920 align:start position:0%
say is it's a it's it's 30% of one thing
 
02:02:53.149 --> 02:02:53.159 align:start position:0%
but 40% of something entirely different
 
02:02:57.069 --> 02:02:57.079 align:start position:0%
the 30% is a cap and the 40% is of
 
02:02:59.750 --> 02:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
whatever you discount to what you so
 
02:03:02.709 --> 02:03:02.719 align:start position:0%
maybe you can explain that better so
 
02:03:06.470 --> 02:03:06.480 align:start position:0%
right now if you make 30% of whatever
 
02:03:09.189 --> 02:03:09.199 align:start position:0%
your unemployment benefit is then you
 
02:03:10.669 --> 02:03:10.679 align:start position:0%
get to keep all that money without
 
02:03:13.189 --> 02:03:13.199 align:start position:0%
impacting your unemployment benefit if
 
02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:16.599 align:start position:0%
you go to 31% that 1% gets deducted off
 
02:03:18.109 --> 02:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
of whatever your unemployment benefit is
 
02:03:20.550 --> 02:03:20.560 align:start position:0%
so there's zero incentive to ever work
 
02:03:22.310 --> 02:03:22.320 align:start position:0%
part-time to the point that you would
 
02:03:24.870 --> 02:03:24.880 align:start position:0%
get above 30% of whatever your
 
02:03:27.310 --> 02:03:27.320 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits is this change
 
02:03:29.750 --> 02:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
would say anything you earn from the
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
very beginning we will take 40% of
 
02:03:34.950 --> 02:03:34.960 align:start position:0%
whatever deduct 40% of whatever your
 
02:03:36.830 --> 02:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
earnings were in a given week from your
 
02:03:38.390 --> 02:03:38.400 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits so if you're
 
02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:39.470 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits so if you're
making

02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
making
 
02:03:43.830 --> 02:03:43.840 align:start position:0%
$300 and under the current system you
 
02:03:45.870 --> 02:03:45.880 align:start position:0%
could earn just under 100 bucks before
 
02:03:48.669 --> 02:03:48.679 align:start position:0%
it starts deducting from your benefits
 
02:03:51.310 --> 02:03:51.320 align:start position:0%
if if you in that same analysis or that
 
02:03:53.109 --> 02:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
same scenario if you're making $300 and
 
02:03:57.950 --> 02:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
you earn $100 they would deduct $40 from
 
02:04:00.910 --> 02:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
your unemployment benefits whereas in
 
02:04:02.310 --> 02:04:02.320 align:start position:0%
the current system nothing would be
 
02:04:04.669 --> 02:04:04.679 align:start position:0%
deducted for that first 30% does that
 
02:04:04.679 --> 02:04:07.910 align:start position:0%
deducted for that first 30% does that
make

02:04:07.910 --> 02:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:11.910 --> 02:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
sense it makes sense to me okay okay let
 
02:04:14.589 --> 02:04:14.599 align:start position:0%
let me do it let's do just easier even
 
02:04:15.830 --> 02:04:15.840 align:start position:0%
though these numbers don't apply to the
 
02:04:17.149 --> 02:04:17.159 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire system let's assume you're
 
02:04:19.030 --> 02:04:19.040 align:start position:0%
getting $1,000 a week in unemployment
 
02:04:21.549 --> 02:04:21.559 align:start position:0%
benefits for easier math you could earn
 
02:04:24.189 --> 02:04:24.199 align:start position:0%
$300 working part-time and have it not
 
02:04:25.790 --> 02:04:25.800 align:start position:0%
impact your unemployment
 
02:04:28.589 --> 02:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
benefits if you earned
 
02:04:32.709 --> 02:04:32.719 align:start position:0%
$400 then $100 would be deducted because
 
02:04:35.310 --> 02:04:35.320 align:start position:0%
you get to keep the 30% of whatever your
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
your your weekly earnings are under this
 
02:04:40.589 --> 02:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
system if you were earning $1,000 and
 
02:04:42.990 --> 02:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
then we took and and then you earned
 
02:04:45.830 --> 02:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
$300 working part-time we would take off
 
02:04:49.629 --> 02:04:49.639 align:start position:0%
$120 off of your unemployment benefits
 
02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
so there's an incentive to work if if
 
02:04:56.669 --> 02:04:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:04.709 --> 02:05:04.719 align:start position:0%
sense so the change is there's no hard
 
02:05:09.149 --> 02:05:09.159 align:start position:0%
cap but also this partial deduction for
 
02:05:10.950 --> 02:05:10.960 align:start position:0%
the money that you've earned working
 
02:05:14.629 --> 02:05:14.639 align:start position:0%
part-time starts from the first
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
dollar so it's a it's two changes at
 
02:05:20.030 --> 02:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
once I understand
 
02:05:23.229 --> 02:05:23.239 align:start position:0%
it uh representative
 
02:05:26.350 --> 02:05:26.360 align:start position:0%
Sullivan is it is it accurate
 
02:05:30.390 --> 02:05:30.400 align:start position:0%
that currently it's 30% of the benefit
 
02:05:34.510 --> 02:05:34.520 align:start position:0%
and you're proposing 40% of
 
02:05:37.709 --> 02:05:37.719 align:start position:0%
earnings yes um I've only changed it to
 
02:05:39.430 --> 02:05:39.440 align:start position:0%
to to the
 
02:05:42.189 --> 02:05:42.199 align:start position:0%
wages but the so that was one of the
 
02:05:43.870 --> 02:05:43.880 align:start position:0%
things that was I I think I fixed it
 
02:05:47.069 --> 02:05:47.079 align:start position:0%
with the amendment and if I didn't then
 
02:05:48.510 --> 02:05:48.520 align:start position:0%
and that's like the sticking point then
 
02:05:51.430 --> 02:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
I I guess you guys would be wiser than I
 
02:05:53.310 --> 02:05:53.320 align:start position:0%
am how how to address that but I think I
 
02:05:55.870 --> 02:05:55.880 align:start position:0%
fixed it with the amendment by just
 
02:05:59.549 --> 02:05:59.559 align:start position:0%
changing uh the wages part
 
02:06:02.830 --> 02:06:02.840 align:start position:0%
followup follow up the sentence
 
02:06:06.990 --> 02:06:07.000 align:start position:0%
structure in that part of the bill is
 
02:06:10.549 --> 02:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
um it it's it's I had to read it about
 
02:06:12.350 --> 02:06:12.360 align:start position:0%
10 times to try to figure out what it
 
02:06:16.350 --> 02:06:16.360 align:start position:0%
meant um and I still wasn't sure um so I
 
02:06:18.149 --> 02:06:18.159 align:start position:0%
basically I I think perhaps if we could
 
02:06:20.069 --> 02:06:20.079 align:start position:0%
work in this sentence structure and come
 
02:06:22.990 --> 02:06:23.000 align:start position:0%
up with a clearer way of stating your
 
02:06:27.629 --> 02:06:27.639 align:start position:0%
intent um that that might help but uh it
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
just there's a one too many um
 
02:06:33.310 --> 02:06:33.320 align:start position:0%
prepositional phrases in
 
02:06:33.320 --> 02:06:35.390 align:start position:0%
prepositional phrases in
there

02:06:35.390 --> 02:06:35.400 align:start position:0%
there
 
02:06:39.109 --> 02:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:41.669 --> 02:06:41.679 align:start position:0%
questions uh representative infantine if
 
02:06:47.589 --> 02:06:47.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:47.599 --> 02:06:55.470 align:start position:0%
 
question

02:06:55.470 --> 02:06:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:57.589 --> 02:06:57.599 align:start position:0%
two things number one I think was your
 
02:06:59.390 --> 02:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
question uh Brian I've already had
 
02:07:00.549 --> 02:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
discussion with the Department they're
 
02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:03.360 align:start position:0%
going to provide some clarity to it uh
 
02:07:05.390 --> 02:07:05.400 align:start position:0%
second thing is uh it's very this is
 
02:07:08.950 --> 02:07:08.960 align:start position:0%
very simple you have a u Act take effect
 
02:07:11.390 --> 02:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
60 days after its passage my only
 
02:07:13.589 --> 02:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
question is would you be amendable to
 
02:07:15.910 --> 02:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
maybe being on a quarterly basis or
 
02:07:17.629 --> 02:07:17.639 align:start position:0%
whatever the next quarter is going to be
 
02:07:19.669 --> 02:07:19.679 align:start position:0%
because I think it will help with the
 
02:07:21.109 --> 02:07:21.119 align:start position:0%
with the Department you know how they do
 
02:07:22.669 --> 02:07:22.679 align:start position:0%
things on their quarters and other
 
02:07:24.549 --> 02:07:24.559 align:start position:0%
things would you have any issue if it
 
02:07:26.589 --> 02:07:26.599 align:start position:0%
was yeah no I think that's that's
 
02:07:27.629 --> 02:07:27.639 align:start position:0%
totally I think that was just sort of
 
02:07:30.310 --> 02:07:30.320 align:start position:0%
the default that's put in there so um
 
02:07:32.030 --> 02:07:32.040 align:start position:0%
whatever is makes it easier for them to
 
02:07:34.270 --> 02:07:34.280 align:start position:0%
implement if it gets passed then yeah
 
02:07:36.589 --> 02:07:36.599 align:start position:0%
and if they have ideas of how to better
 
02:07:38.790 --> 02:07:38.800 align:start position:0%
language I think the the gist of what
 
02:07:41.189 --> 02:07:41.199 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to do is clear to hopefully
 
02:07:43.950 --> 02:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
the majority of the people in here um if
 
02:07:46.470 --> 02:07:46.480 align:start position:0%
if you're supportive of that then
 
02:07:49.910 --> 02:07:49.920 align:start position:0%
clarifying language I'm that's fine my
 
02:07:53.189 --> 02:07:53.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:56.629 --> 02:07:56.639 align:start position:0%
think further questions representative
 
02:07:58.629 --> 02:07:58.639 align:start position:0%
Schulz and if you don't know the answer
 
02:08:02.069 --> 02:08:02.079 align:start position:0%
to this I can save it but um from when I
 
02:08:04.470 --> 02:08:04.480 align:start position:0%
was last unemployed I remember one of
 
02:08:06.510 --> 02:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
the questions to screen whether or not
 
02:08:10.030 --> 02:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
you're eligible at least it used to be
 
02:08:13.030 --> 02:08:13.040 align:start position:0%
um you know basically have you been
 
02:08:14.229 --> 02:08:14.239 align:start position:0%
offered a
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
job that you're not taking and the
 
02:08:19.149 --> 02:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
implication I don't know if I'm wording
 
02:08:21.109 --> 02:08:21.119 align:start position:0%
it exactly the way it was but the
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
implication was really that you can't
 
02:08:26.109 --> 02:08:26.119 align:start position:0%
turn down these
 
02:08:28.270 --> 02:08:28.280 align:start position:0%
shortterm gigs
 
02:08:31.310 --> 02:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
potentially um do you know the screen
 
02:08:32.549 --> 02:08:32.559 align:start position:0%
I'm certainly not the expert on it I
 
02:08:33.870 --> 02:08:33.880 align:start position:0%
know the department will be more
 
02:08:35.870 --> 02:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
informed than I am but when I was on
 
02:08:37.750 --> 02:08:37.760 align:start position:0%
unemployment last year that was not how
 
02:08:40.149 --> 02:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
I interpreted those things because I had
 
02:08:41.950 --> 02:08:41.960 align:start position:0%
a job that was making well over six
 
02:08:44.270 --> 02:08:44.280 align:start position:0%
figures taking a job at Walmart or
 
02:08:45.510 --> 02:08:45.520 align:start position:0%
something like that I don't think is
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
considered a suitable change so think if
 
02:08:51.830 --> 02:08:51.840 align:start position:0%
you're able to show that your job was up
 
02:08:53.430 --> 02:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
here and now you're offered a minimum
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
wage job I don't think you're required
 
02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
to take that that was how it was
 
02:08:59.030 --> 02:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
explained to me anyways thank you
 
02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:00.830 align:start position:0%
explained to me anyways thank you
further

02:09:00.830 --> 02:09:00.840 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:09:03.109 --> 02:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you very
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
much for your testimony gav back over to
 
02:09:09.149 --> 02:09:09.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:09:12.390 --> 02:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
you yes um you are not required to take
 
02:09:13.549 --> 02:09:13.559 align:start position:0%
something if it does meet a certain
 
02:09:15.629 --> 02:09:15.639 align:start position:0%
percentage of your previous job and and
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
whatever um you I just want to make sure
 
02:09:19.790 --> 02:09:19.800 align:start position:0%
you have have the the pink card from the
 
02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
last hearing from U Mr got Le and then
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
you have that one from representative
 
02:09:27.990 --> 02:09:28.000 align:start position:0%
solivan right there okay um commissioner
 
02:09:30.510 --> 02:09:30.520 align:start position:0%
lavs assist commissioner labers labers
 
02:09:32.589 --> 02:09:32.599 align:start position:0%
lavers I'm sorry Richard I rick rich I

02:09:37.790 --> 02:09:37.800 align:start position:0%
apologies You' think after all these
 
02:09:39.830 --> 02:09:39.840 align:start position:0%
years I'd know how to say it correctly
 
02:09:40.910 --> 02:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to
 
02:09:42.030 --> 02:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
actually pay attention to how you
 
02:09:43.229 --> 02:09:43.239 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself and I'm going to try
 
02:09:45.189 --> 02:09:45.199 align:start position:0%
to put it to memory
 
02:09:47.870 --> 02:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
here I think I pronounce every single
 
02:09:57.390 --> 02:09:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:00.109 --> 02:10:00.119 align:start position:0%
balanced uh thank you Mr chairman so for
 
02:10:03.549 --> 02:10:03.559 align:start position:0%
the record Richard uh lavers lers I
 
02:10:04.830 --> 02:10:04.840 align:start position:0%
respond to
 
02:10:06.910 --> 02:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
both a Deputy Commissioner with
 
02:10:09.069 --> 02:10:09.079 align:start position:0%
Employment Security um I've handed
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
around some just some written testimony
 
02:10:14.750 --> 02:10:14.760 align:start position:0%
with regard to um uh some of the issues
 
02:10:16.750 --> 02:10:16.760 align:start position:0%
that were addressed in the original bill
 
02:10:18.790 --> 02:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
I haven't I haven't seen the amended
 
02:10:22.629 --> 02:10:22.639 align:start position:0%
version that was just discussed but um
 
02:10:25.470 --> 02:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
as I understand it thank you
 
02:10:29.069 --> 02:10:29.079 align:start position:0%
representative um so a lot of the
 
02:10:31.510 --> 02:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
comments that I was planning on making
 
02:10:33.390 --> 02:10:33.400 align:start position:0%
were with regard to the changes to
 
02:10:36.149 --> 02:10:36.159 align:start position:0%
deductible earnings um but it looks like
 
02:10:38.350 --> 02:10:38.360 align:start position:0%
there are no proposed changes to
 
02:10:40.470 --> 02:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
deductible earnings uh which from the
 
02:10:42.470 --> 02:10:42.480 align:start position:0%
Department's perspective is good uh
 
02:10:44.069 --> 02:10:44.079 align:start position:0%
because there was there was some concern
 
02:10:46.470 --> 02:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
around that and and how it would be
 
02:10:48.229 --> 02:10:48.239 align:start position:0%
applied compared to how New Hampshire
 
02:10:51.229 --> 02:10:51.239 align:start position:0%
currently treats separation payments
 
02:10:52.709 --> 02:10:52.719 align:start position:0%
other types of payments that are
 
02:10:54.430 --> 02:10:54.440 align:start position:0%
received by an individual when they lose
 
02:10:56.270 --> 02:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
their employment um and how those
 
02:10:57.790 --> 02:10:57.800 align:start position:0%
currently apply an impact when you can
 
02:10:59.870 --> 02:10:59.880 align:start position:0%
start receiving your your your your
 
02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
temporary wage replacement from the
 
02:11:04.069 --> 02:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
unemployment program so I'll I won't go
 
02:11:08.030 --> 02:11:08.040 align:start position:0%
into any of that material um I'll stay
 
02:11:10.229 --> 02:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
focused on the disregard portion of it
 
02:11:13.149 --> 02:11:13.159 align:start position:0%
which um is the provision that is um
 
02:11:16.310 --> 02:11:16.320 align:start position:0%
sought to be changed so uh New Hampshire
 
02:11:19.430 --> 02:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
like um um every other state in the the
 
02:11:20.790 --> 02:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
country and I can provide you with a
 
02:11:25.390 --> 02:11:25.400 align:start position:0%
chart on this um has a disregard for how
 
02:11:28.310 --> 02:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
much an individual is allowed to earn in
 
02:11:29.990 --> 02:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
part-time employment while collecting
 
02:11:32.229 --> 02:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefits before those
 
02:11:34.750 --> 02:11:34.760 align:start position:0%
earnings start to impact or reduce their
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit so New Hampshire
 
02:11:38.709 --> 02:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
sets it as a percentage of your weekly
 
02:11:40.669 --> 02:11:40.679 align:start position:0%
benefit amount I think it was uh
 
02:11:44.109 --> 02:11:44.119 align:start position:0%
described very well um before so an IND
 
02:11:45.709 --> 02:11:45.719 align:start position:0%
an individual is allowed to have
 
02:11:47.470 --> 02:11:47.480 align:start position:0%
part-time employment you can't be full
 
02:11:49.229 --> 02:11:49.239 align:start position:0%
you can't be working full-time uh the
 
02:11:51.310 --> 02:11:51.320 align:start position:0%
federal government would not consider a
 
02:11:53.390 --> 02:11:53.400 align:start position:0%
state's law that allowed that to be in
 
02:11:55.430 --> 02:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
Conformity and compliance with Federal
 
02:11:58.629 --> 02:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
requirements so you can have part-time
 
02:12:00.790 --> 02:12:00.800 align:start position:0%
employment um and then New Hampshire
 
02:12:03.750 --> 02:12:03.760 align:start position:0%
allows you to earn 30% of your weekly
 
02:12:06.149 --> 02:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
benefit amount uh without any impact on
 
02:12:08.990 --> 02:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
your weekly benefit amount so for that
 
02:12:11.350 --> 02:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh going back to that um average weekly
 
02:12:13.310 --> 02:12:13.320 align:start position:0%
benefit amount of around
 
02:12:15.950 --> 02:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
$350 um so New Hampshire allows you to
 
02:12:18.629 --> 02:12:18.639 align:start position:0%
have part-time earnings of about 15
 
02:12:22.669 --> 02:12:22.679 align:start position:0%
$1 or 30% without any reduction uh to
 
02:12:28.189 --> 02:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
your 350 now the dollars above that 30%
 
02:12:30.189 --> 02:12:30.199 align:start position:0%
they start to impact your weekly benefit
 
02:12:32.470 --> 02:12:32.480 align:start position:0%
amount so you keep your earnings you
 
02:12:33.750 --> 02:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
know we're not doing anything with the
 
02:12:36.470 --> 02:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
earnings it's the weekly benefit amount
 
02:12:39.549 --> 02:12:39.559 align:start position:0%
that gets reduced dollar for dooll for
 
02:12:43.189 --> 02:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
any earnings in excess of 30% of your
 
02:12:45.709 --> 02:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount so again that that
 
02:12:48.870 --> 02:12:48.880 align:start position:0%
average weekly benefit amount uh fer at
 
02:12:52.030 --> 02:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
350 anything they're earning above 115
 
02:12:55.270 --> 02:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
or thereabouts my math isn't perfect U
 
02:12:57.109 --> 02:12:57.119 align:start position:0%
my father was my high school Kel teacher
 
02:12:59.830 --> 02:12:59.840 align:start position:0%
so we can blame him um but anything
 
02:13:01.870 --> 02:13:01.880 align:start position:0%
above that 115 is going to reduce your
 
02:13:05.430 --> 02:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
your unemployment benefit um so each
 
02:13:08.109 --> 02:13:08.119 align:start position:0%
state has some has a similar mechanism
 
02:13:10.709 --> 02:13:10.719 align:start position:0%
um when we look um to our our neighbor
 
02:13:13.109 --> 02:13:13.119 align:start position:0%
to the east in Maine um they don't set a
 
02:13:15.030 --> 02:13:15.040 align:start position:0%
percentage they set a flat dollar amount
 
02:13:16.990 --> 02:13:17.000 align:start position:0%
so in Maine you're allowed to keep the
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
first $100 earnings and then anything
 
02:13:20.950 --> 02:13:20.960 align:start position:0%
above that is a reduction against your
 
02:13:23.549 --> 02:13:23.559 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit Massachusetts
 
02:13:25.669 --> 02:13:25.679 align:start position:0%
allows you to earn I think a quarter of
 
02:13:28.069 --> 02:13:28.079 align:start position:0%
your weekly benefit amount but you can't
 
02:13:31.109 --> 02:13:31.119 align:start position:0%
exceed your the average weekly benefit
 
02:13:32.950 --> 02:13:32.960 align:start position:0%
the average weekly wage in the state for
 
02:13:34.390 --> 02:13:34.400 align:start position:0%
the prior year it's a little bit more
 
02:13:36.549 --> 02:13:36.559 align:start position:0%
complicated uh than how we do it but
 
02:13:38.990 --> 02:13:39.000 align:start position:0%
each state has a similar
 
02:13:41.510 --> 02:13:41.520 align:start position:0%
mechanism um but the the way the
 
02:13:43.950 --> 02:13:43.960 align:start position:0%
mechanism currently works again it's
 
02:13:49.390 --> 02:13:49.400 align:start position:0%
it's 30% and that 30% is of your of your
 
02:13:52.109 --> 02:13:52.119 align:start position:0%
weekly unemployment benefit so it's not
 
02:13:54.270 --> 02:13:54.280 align:start position:0%
of your earnings it's of your
 
02:13:57.229 --> 02:13:57.239 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit so that first
 
02:14:00.750 --> 02:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
$115 on that example that person keeps
 
02:14:00.760 --> 02:14:01.430 align:start position:0%
$115 on that example that person keeps
that

02:14:01.430 --> 02:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:14:05.270 --> 02:14:05.280 align:start position:0%
$115 without any impact to their $350
 
02:14:08.669 --> 02:14:08.679 align:start position:0%
weekly unemployment benefit um what I am
 
02:14:10.149 --> 02:14:10.159 align:start position:0%
understanding The Proposal would do is
 
02:14:13.310 --> 02:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
it would it would increase the 30 to
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
40% it would be 40% of your earnings and
 
02:14:20.790 --> 02:14:20.800 align:start position:0%
it would be on the first dollar earned
 
02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:23.360 align:start position:0%
so um right now you you don't have any
 
02:14:26.669 --> 02:14:26.679 align:start position:0%
impact on the first dollar earned so um
 
02:14:30.950 --> 02:14:30.960 align:start position:0%
a an individual who um has low part-time
 
02:14:32.549 --> 02:14:32.559 align:start position:0%
earnings while they're collecting
 
02:14:34.870 --> 02:14:34.880 align:start position:0%
unemployment um would see no impact to
 
02:14:37.189 --> 02:14:37.199 align:start position:0%
their unemployment benefit if we were to
 
02:14:39.589 --> 02:14:39.599 align:start position:0%
change that into reduce their benefit
 
02:14:42.270 --> 02:14:42.280 align:start position:0%
with the first dollar earned then there
 
02:14:44.149 --> 02:14:44.159 align:start position:0%
would be an impact on their unemployment
 
02:14:46.709 --> 02:14:46.719 align:start position:0%
benefit with that first dollar earned so
 
02:14:51.310 --> 02:14:51.320 align:start position:0%
that would be a um significant change in
 
02:14:56.390 --> 02:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
how this 30% disregard is currently uh
 
02:15:00.229 --> 02:15:00.239 align:start position:0%
constructed um in New Hampshire
 
02:15:03.830 --> 02:15:03.840 align:start position:0%
um with regard to the um the suitable
 
02:15:08.270 --> 02:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
work conversation so um an individual is
 
02:15:10.310 --> 02:15:10.320 align:start position:0%
required to accept suitable employment
 
02:15:11.950 --> 02:15:11.960 align:start position:0%
so you're not you're not required to
 
02:15:13.350 --> 02:15:13.360 align:start position:0%
accept all employment I thought the
 
02:15:16.310 --> 02:15:16.320 align:start position:0%
example um uh from the the prior speaker
 
02:15:18.030 --> 02:15:18.040 align:start position:0%
was excellent where if you were earning
 
02:15:20.910 --> 02:15:20.920 align:start position:0%
six figures and offered a a uh a job at
 
02:15:23.109 --> 02:15:23.119 align:start position:0%
Walmart greeting individuals that's not
 
02:15:24.629 --> 02:15:24.639 align:start position:0%
going to necessarily consider be
 
02:15:26.669 --> 02:15:26.679 align:start position:0%
suitable employment for you um we look
 
02:15:27.990 --> 02:15:28.000 align:start position:0%
at what you earned in your prior
 
02:15:30.310 --> 02:15:30.320 align:start position:0%
employment we look at um what your
 
02:15:32.830 --> 02:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
commuting pattern was in your prior
 
02:15:34.390 --> 02:15:34.400 align:start position:0%
employment we look at what the commute
 
02:15:36.270 --> 02:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
would be required in the job that's
 
02:15:37.709 --> 02:15:37.719 align:start position:0%
being offered we look at what your
 
02:15:40.709 --> 02:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
obligations at home are um you know what
 
02:15:43.149 --> 02:15:43.159 align:start position:0%
shifts are you available for because of
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
uh perhaps you have to take care of kids
 
02:15:47.830 --> 02:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
or or an adult in the house all of that
 
02:15:49.790 --> 02:15:49.800 align:start position:0%
is considered when looking at whether or
 
02:15:51.790 --> 02:15:51.800 align:start position:0%
not a job that is offered to you is
 
02:15:54.470 --> 02:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
considered suitable um so if it is
 
02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
suitable and you don't accept it um that
 
02:16:00.629 --> 02:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
would uh disqualify you for benefits um
 
02:16:03.750 --> 02:16:03.760 align:start position:0%
for that week if it is determined to be
 
02:16:06.030 --> 02:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
not suitable um then you're going to get
 
02:16:07.990 --> 02:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
paid your benefits for that week because
 
02:16:09.629 --> 02:16:09.639 align:start position:0%
the job that was offered was not
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
considered suitable so that's an anal
 
02:16:14.510 --> 02:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's an analysis we do um as part of
 
02:16:16.270 --> 02:16:16.280 align:start position:0%
it can come up in a variety of ways it
 
02:16:18.510 --> 02:16:18.520 align:start position:0%
could be the individual um informing the
 
02:16:19.870 --> 02:16:19.880 align:start position:0%
department of that when they're filing
 
02:16:21.189 --> 02:16:21.199 align:start position:0%
their weekly claim it could be an
 
02:16:23.189 --> 02:16:23.199 align:start position:0%
employer calling in and saying hey I
 
02:16:24.990 --> 02:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
keep on offering people jobs and they
 
02:16:27.069 --> 02:16:27.079 align:start position:0%
they keep on uh not taking them and
 
02:16:28.350 --> 02:16:28.360 align:start position:0%
telling me that they want to continue to
 
02:16:29.790 --> 02:16:29.800 align:start position:0%
collect unemployment benefits and I
 
02:16:31.109 --> 02:16:31.119 align:start position:0%
don't think that's right can you look at
 
02:16:33.509 --> 02:16:33.519 align:start position:0%
this for me um so we we look at it in a
 
02:16:35.750 --> 02:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
variety of ways um but you're required
 
02:16:37.230 --> 02:16:37.240 align:start position:0%
to accept suitable employment and
 
02:16:38.950 --> 02:16:38.960 align:start position:0%
suitable employment is different based
 
02:16:40.549 --> 02:16:40.559 align:start position:0%
upon your circumstances and we look at
 
02:16:42.589 --> 02:16:42.599 align:start position:0%
each and every one on a case-by Case
 
02:16:45.549 --> 02:16:45.559 align:start position:0%
basis um and um with that I'll I'll turn
 
02:16:48.190 --> 02:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
it over um back to the committee all
 
02:16:49.150 --> 02:16:49.160 align:start position:0%
right I'm going to do something a little
 
02:16:50.629 --> 02:16:50.639 align:start position:0%
unorthodox if you might to stay there
 
02:16:51.910 --> 02:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
for a second because I'm I'm a little
 
02:16:53.629 --> 02:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
confused my vice chairman and I are
 
02:16:55.469 --> 02:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
having a little discussion here
 
02:16:57.150 --> 02:16:57.160 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan it is your
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
intent to try to allow an individual to
 
02:17:03.589 --> 02:17:03.599 align:start position:0%
earn more
 
02:17:06.790 --> 02:17:06.800 align:start position:0%
money um on a side
 
02:17:10.910 --> 02:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
job before it impacts their unemployment
 
02:17:15.709 --> 02:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
correct sort of my intent is to
 
02:17:19.110 --> 02:17:19.120 align:start position:0%
encourage people to work more so right
 
02:17:21.950 --> 02:17:21.960 align:start position:0%
now when we hit that 30% cut off you're
 
02:17:23.349 --> 02:17:23.359 align:start position:0%
actually worse off if you work that
 
02:17:24.830 --> 02:17:24.840 align:start position:0%
extra dollar because some taxes are
 
02:17:26.589 --> 02:17:26.599 align:start position:0%
taking out of that extra dollar so if we
 
02:17:29.790 --> 02:17:29.800 align:start position:0%
could encourage people to work because
 
02:17:32.230 --> 02:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
the 40% just it's always 40% whether you
 
02:17:34.669 --> 02:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
go to 50% of your potential earnings
 
02:17:36.429 --> 02:17:36.439 align:start position:0%
it's 40% of that or whatever of your
 
02:17:38.709 --> 02:17:38.719 align:start position:0%
weekly earnings so my intent is to
 
02:17:41.910 --> 02:17:41.920 align:start position:0%
encourage people to work past the point
 
02:17:45.309 --> 02:17:45.319 align:start position:0%
of making 30% of your weekly payment all
 
02:17:47.030 --> 02:17:47.040 align:start position:0%
right understood thank you I just want
 
02:17:50.950 --> 02:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
to make sure so um rich and I had a
 
02:17:53.270 --> 02:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
conversation earlier in the week about
 
02:17:58.110 --> 02:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
this um had a neighbor he was making a
 
02:18:00.870 --> 02:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
example 100 beans a week on his regular
 
02:18:03.669 --> 02:18:03.679 align:start position:0%
job he was making 25 beans a week
 
02:18:05.110 --> 02:18:05.120 align:start position:0%
working for the
 
02:18:07.950 --> 02:18:07.960 align:start position:0%
church he lost his
 
02:18:10.950 --> 02:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
job and he went to get unemployment
 
02:18:12.669 --> 02:18:12.679 align:start position:0%
which is the max of the
 
02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
427 but then he was going to get cut on
 
02:18:18.270 --> 02:18:18.280 align:start position:0%
some of that 427 because of the the
 
02:18:20.389 --> 02:18:20.399 align:start position:0%
money he made on the weekends doing some
 
02:18:22.990 --> 02:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
stuff for the church and I thought to
 
02:18:26.830 --> 02:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
myself how stupid is that he had two
 
02:18:29.150 --> 02:18:29.160 align:start position:0%
sets of incomes he was making 100 beans
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
here and 25 beans here and he's still
 
02:18:33.589 --> 02:18:33.599 align:start position:0%
making the 25 beans because he still has
 
02:18:34.990 --> 02:18:35.000 align:start position:0%
that job how many people have part-time
 
02:18:36.549 --> 02:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
jobs the first four years of my life I
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
had two jobs you know um and or of my
 
02:18:45.389 --> 02:18:45.399 align:start position:0%
business or life um so why why would I
 
02:18:48.549 --> 02:18:48.559 align:start position:0%
want to hurt somebody by taking away
 
02:18:51.509 --> 02:18:51.519 align:start position:0%
their 25 beans and and and and yet on
 
02:18:53.030 --> 02:18:53.040 align:start position:0%
the other hand I can say okay well you
 
02:18:55.190 --> 02:18:55.200 align:start position:0%
don't want someone kind of not having
 
02:18:57.990 --> 02:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
that second job getting a second job and
 
02:18:59.589 --> 02:18:59.599 align:start position:0%
and getting the other there's got to be
 
02:19:02.429 --> 02:19:02.439 align:start position:0%
a better way because I don't like that
 
02:19:04.750 --> 02:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
it affects the person that is willingly
 
02:19:08.709 --> 02:19:08.719 align:start position:0%
working two jobs to to make ends meet or
 
02:19:10.990 --> 02:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
to have things better for themselves yet
 
02:19:13.589 --> 02:19:13.599 align:start position:0%
they lose their bigger job and they get
 
02:19:16.629 --> 02:19:16.639 align:start position:0%
nixed for it and I think this would sort
 
02:19:18.589 --> 02:19:18.599 align:start position:0%
of address that You' still you'd get
 
02:19:20.429 --> 02:19:20.439 align:start position:0%
some deducted but it wouldn't really
 
02:19:23.150 --> 02:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
hurt you too much versus Under the
 
02:19:26.230 --> 02:19:26.240 align:start position:0%
current system if that well that with
 
02:19:28.230 --> 02:19:28.240 align:start position:0%
your math the 25 beans wouldn't be
 
02:19:29.950 --> 02:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
impacted but if you were earning 35
 
02:19:33.870 --> 02:19:33.880 align:start position:0%
beans it certainly would now
 
02:19:36.270 --> 02:19:36.280 align:start position:0%
also Mr LS and I talk about the fact
 
02:19:38.509 --> 02:19:38.519 align:start position:0%
that the wording may
 
02:19:42.190 --> 02:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
be backwards it may hurt more than
 
02:19:42.200 --> 02:19:43.110 align:start position:0%
be backwards it may hurt more than
you're

02:19:43.110 --> 02:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
you're
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
helping did I miss that in our earlier
 
02:19:46.439 --> 02:19:48.630 align:start position:0%
helping did I miss that in our earlier
conversation

02:19:48.630 --> 02:19:48.640 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
02:19:52.950 --> 02:19:52.960 align:start position:0%
um well the the wording and um the the
 
02:19:56.190 --> 02:19:56.200 align:start position:0%
removal of the the current language in
 
02:19:58.469 --> 02:19:58.479 align:start position:0%
excess of and then the comparison being
 
02:20:00.790 --> 02:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
against your your weekly unemployment
 
02:20:04.670 --> 02:20:04.680 align:start position:0%
benefit um that's the wording that we
 
02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
had talked about previously so and I
 
02:20:10.590 --> 02:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
think that's it's intentional um but um
 
02:20:15.070 --> 02:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
the sponsors looking at changing that
 
02:20:17.150 --> 02:20:17.160 align:start position:0%
percentage and increasing it but also it
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
being being a percentage of a of a it's
 
02:20:23.070 --> 02:20:23.080 align:start position:0%
a different denominator right um so
 
02:20:24.710 --> 02:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
looking at it being a percentage of your
 
02:20:27.790 --> 02:20:27.800 align:start position:0%
earnings rather than the percentage of
 
02:20:29.510 --> 02:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
your weekly unemployment benefit which
 
02:20:32.590 --> 02:20:32.600 align:start position:0%
is how it it currently is
 
02:20:36.309 --> 02:20:36.319 align:start position:0%
structured so go ahead also this is not
 
02:20:38.389 --> 02:20:38.399 align:start position:0%
a novel idea this is the system that
 
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
Vermont uses as well uh and other other
 
02:20:42.429 --> 02:20:42.439 align:start position:0%
states as well but I just looked at the
 
02:20:45.270 --> 02:20:45.280 align:start position:0%
three around us so it's not like I
 
02:20:47.830 --> 02:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
created this on my own
 
02:20:49.110 --> 02:20:49.120 align:start position:0%
all right representat I appreciate it if
 
02:20:51.590 --> 02:20:51.600 align:start position:0%
you would uh step back and uh appreciate
 
02:20:53.429 --> 02:20:53.439 align:start position:0%
you you you doing what you just did with
 
02:20:55.590 --> 02:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
these guys now I have questions of my
 
02:20:58.150 --> 02:20:58.160 align:start position:0%
committee uh one Brian followed by the
 
02:20:59.389 --> 02:20:59.399 align:start position:0%
other Brian because you you had that
 
02:21:02.230 --> 02:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
first seaworth by
 
02:21:05.230 --> 02:21:05.240 align:start position:0%
Sullivan um I won't ask this as a
 
02:21:07.950 --> 02:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
question to the previous one um maybe
 
02:21:13.830 --> 02:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
he'll not have you heard uh phrase uh as
 
02:21:18.670 --> 02:21:18.680 align:start position:0%
um benefits Cliff where um when people
 
02:21:20.990 --> 02:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
get to a certain point of the benefits
 
02:21:22.710 --> 02:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
and and since you're nodding I'll ask
 
02:21:24.389 --> 02:21:24.399 align:start position:0%
the question of you people getting to a
 
02:21:26.070 --> 02:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
certain point of their
 
02:21:28.710 --> 02:21:28.720 align:start position:0%
benefits earning another dollar they
 
02:21:30.750 --> 02:21:30.760 align:start position:0%
lose a dollar or more from the benefits
 
02:21:33.429 --> 02:21:33.439 align:start position:0%
so there's zero incentive to cross that
 
02:21:33.439 --> 02:21:34.790 align:start position:0%
so there's zero incentive to cross that
line

02:21:34.790 --> 02:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:21:37.510 --> 02:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
and I see you nod yes
 
02:21:40.469 --> 02:21:40.479 align:start position:0%
maybe um yeah I'm quite familiar with
 
02:21:44.150 --> 02:21:44.160 align:start position:0%
the the whole benefit Cliff issue the um
 
02:21:46.309 --> 02:21:46.319 align:start position:0%
uh if you if you Google benefit Cliff
 
02:21:47.750 --> 02:21:47.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the first link that comes
 
02:21:49.389 --> 02:21:49.399 align:start position:0%
up is a report that was done a few years
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
ago by a a firm called EC consult they
 
02:21:53.630 --> 02:21:53.640 align:start position:0%
teamed up with the national Center for
 
02:21:55.990 --> 02:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
Children in poverty and did a a report
 
02:21:57.510 --> 02:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
looking at all sorts of benefit payments
 
02:21:59.070 --> 02:21:59.080 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire looking at tanif and
 
02:22:02.230 --> 02:22:02.240 align:start position:0%
snap and Medicaid housing vouchers um uh
 
02:22:03.990 --> 02:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
fuel assistance and unemployment
 
02:22:06.349 --> 02:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
benefits um it was a report that was
 
02:22:09.150 --> 02:22:09.160 align:start position:0%
done um at the behest of Health and
 
02:22:11.750 --> 02:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
Human Services and employment security
 
02:22:13.910 --> 02:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
um if you haven't looked at I would i'
 
02:22:15.710 --> 02:22:15.720 align:start position:0%
highly suggest it it actually does a a
 
02:22:19.150 --> 02:22:19.160 align:start position:0%
community by community um analysis of
 
02:22:21.750 --> 02:22:21.760 align:start position:0%
benefit cliffs in your community based
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
upon the recipiency rates of residents
 
02:22:26.550 --> 02:22:26.560 align:start position:0%
of that town or or city and what they're
 
02:22:28.630 --> 02:22:28.640 align:start position:0%
receiving from different um uh
 
02:22:31.590 --> 02:22:31.600 align:start position:0%
government support programs uh that that
 
02:22:33.790 --> 02:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
report is currently being updated uh by
 
02:22:35.910 --> 02:22:35.920 align:start position:0%
econsult through some money that the the
 
02:22:38.110 --> 02:22:38.120 align:start position:0%
legislature provided to Health and Human
 
02:22:41.429 --> 02:22:41.439 align:start position:0%
Services in the the last budget um so
 
02:22:43.990 --> 02:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
the the characterization of this
 
02:22:47.670 --> 02:22:47.680 align:start position:0%
disregard as a benefit Cliff um
 
02:22:50.750 --> 02:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
that that that is correct um any way
 
02:22:53.110 --> 02:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
that it is applied at whatever
 
02:22:56.190 --> 02:22:56.200 align:start position:0%
percentage it could it in is in some
 
02:22:59.950 --> 02:22:59.960 align:start position:0%
ways uh functioning similar to a a type
 
02:23:02.349 --> 02:23:02.359 align:start position:0%
of benefit Cliff what we have to
 
02:23:05.230 --> 02:23:05.240 align:start position:0%
remember is that we can't allow uh
 
02:23:08.750 --> 02:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
individuals to have uh full-time
 
02:23:11.190 --> 02:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
earnings um full-time employment and
 
02:23:12.670 --> 02:23:12.680 align:start position:0%
earnings from full-time employment and
 
02:23:14.389 --> 02:23:14.399 align:start position:0%
still be eligible for an unemployment
 
02:23:16.269 --> 02:23:16.279 align:start position:0%
benefit so that's kind of the ceiling
 
02:23:18.269 --> 02:23:18.279 align:start position:0%
that we have to stay under in order to
 
02:23:21.870 --> 02:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
maintain compliance with the feds um but
 
02:23:23.990 --> 02:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
as the the sponsor had indicated and and
 
02:23:26.950 --> 02:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
he had suggested this um the amendment
 
02:23:29.070 --> 02:23:29.080 align:start position:0%
is similar to what Vermont does I told
 
02:23:31.230 --> 02:23:31.240 align:start position:0%
you what what Maine does each state has
 
02:23:32.990 --> 02:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
something a little bit different and I
 
02:23:35.190 --> 02:23:35.200 align:start position:0%
I'll provide you that chart um you'll
 
02:23:37.389 --> 02:23:37.399 align:start position:0%
get a headache from looking at it but
 
02:23:39.790 --> 02:23:39.800 align:start position:0%
I'll provide that to you you can see um
 
02:23:42.469 --> 02:23:42.479 align:start position:0%
how complicated and how simple some of
 
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
the states are I think New Hampshire's
 
02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
probably one of the has a more of a
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
simple way of disregarding arding Maine
 
02:23:50.429 --> 02:23:50.439 align:start position:0%
as a simple way of disregarding um and
 
02:23:51.469 --> 02:23:51.479 align:start position:0%
uh some of the other states are much
 
02:23:54.269 --> 02:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
more complicated follow thank you and
 
02:23:55.710 --> 02:23:55.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for that information I
 
02:23:57.950 --> 02:23:57.960 align:start position:0%
definitely will take a look at that
 
02:24:00.870 --> 02:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
report my followup is a question because
 
02:24:03.790 --> 02:24:03.800 align:start position:0%
I think you're better at math than I am
 
02:24:05.990 --> 02:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
so you talked about what happens at the
 
02:24:09.510 --> 02:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
low end if someone is is already covered
 
02:24:12.309 --> 02:24:12.319 align:start position:0%
by that 30% and what they might
 
02:24:15.790 --> 02:24:15.800 align:start position:0%
lose I'm wondering if there's an issue
 
02:24:19.349 --> 02:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
at the high end so someone has part-time
 
02:24:22.469 --> 02:24:22.479 align:start position:0%
employment but it's they they're paid
 
02:24:22.479 --> 02:24:24.349 align:start position:0%
employment but it's they they're paid
substantially

02:24:24.349 --> 02:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
substantially
 
02:24:27.670 --> 02:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
and without there being any kind of cap
 
02:24:29.710 --> 02:24:29.720 align:start position:0%
where you say you're earning so much
 
02:24:32.750 --> 02:24:32.760 align:start position:0%
through part-time that you don't need
 
02:24:35.230 --> 02:24:35.240 align:start position:0%
these unemployment benefits before does
 
02:24:37.790 --> 02:24:37.800 align:start position:0%
this formula have like kind of a runaway
 
02:24:40.630 --> 02:24:40.640 align:start position:0%
at the top end or am I not doing the
 
02:24:42.030 --> 02:24:42.040 align:start position:0%
math right well you you're allowed to
 
02:24:43.870 --> 02:24:43.880 align:start position:0%
earn more um if your weekly benefit
 
02:24:46.110 --> 02:24:46.120 align:start position:0%
amount is more the way it currently is
 
02:24:48.950 --> 02:24:48.960 align:start position:0%
applied right so if you're at the max if
 
02:24:50.830 --> 02:24:50.840 align:start position:0%
you're you're getting that 427 you're
 
02:24:54.150 --> 02:24:54.160 align:start position:0%
allowed to earn 30% of 427 before it has
 
02:24:56.750 --> 02:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
any impact on your weekly benefit amount
 
02:24:59.429 --> 02:24:59.439 align:start position:0%
so you get up to you get up to around
 
02:25:02.630 --> 02:25:02.640 align:start position:0%
550 uh 550 of thereabouts um and what
 
02:25:04.870 --> 02:25:04.880 align:start position:0%
your your net take-home can be between
 
02:25:06.190 --> 02:25:06.200 align:start position:0%
your part-time earnings and your
 
02:25:07.790 --> 02:25:07.800 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit before there's any
 
02:25:09.630 --> 02:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
reduction and then when you get above
 
02:25:11.590 --> 02:25:11.600 align:start position:0%
that so you can you can have 130% of
 
02:25:13.790 --> 02:25:13.800 align:start position:0%
your weekly benefit amount right now
 
02:25:16.230 --> 02:25:16.240 align:start position:0%
okay um and then anything above that is
 
02:25:18.950 --> 02:25:18.960 align:start position:0%
then results in that dollar for dooll um
 
02:25:21.830 --> 02:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
reduction to your weekly unemployment
 
02:25:27.110 --> 02:25:27.120 align:start position:0%
benefit so and that I understand if we
 
02:25:29.349 --> 02:25:29.359 align:start position:0%
went to this new formula where your
 
02:25:29.359 --> 02:25:30.870 align:start position:0%
went to this new formula where your
reduction

02:25:30.870 --> 02:25:30.880 align:start position:0%
reduction
 
02:25:34.150 --> 02:25:34.160 align:start position:0%
was 40 cents on every dollar but
 
02:25:39.190 --> 02:25:39.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely no cap I'm wondering where
 
02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:40.870 align:start position:0%
absolutely no cap I'm wondering where
eventually

02:25:40.870 --> 02:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
eventually
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
that you
 
02:25:45.710 --> 02:25:45.720 align:start position:0%
you and and that's where I can't do the
 
02:25:48.389 --> 02:25:48.399 align:start position:0%
math very well yeah
 
02:25:51.429 --> 02:25:51.439 align:start position:0%
entire payment but does that get I mean
 
02:25:55.469 --> 02:25:55.479 align:start position:0%
isn't isn't that point a pretty high
 
02:25:57.349 --> 02:25:57.359 align:start position:0%
amount of earnings from your part-time
 
02:26:01.550 --> 02:26:01.560 align:start position:0%
job before that you're still getting
 
02:26:05.190 --> 02:26:05.200 align:start position:0%
some unemployment as a supplement for it
 
02:26:06.910 --> 02:26:06.920 align:start position:0%
yeah and we can we can look at that and
 
02:26:08.750 --> 02:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
and do some of that math for you know if
 
02:26:11.990 --> 02:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
it's applied at 40% of the earnings um
 
02:26:12.750 --> 02:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
before you're going to have any
 
02:26:14.349 --> 02:26:14.359 align:start position:0%
reduction to your weekly benefit amount
 
02:26:16.510 --> 02:26:16.520 align:start position:0%
can see some scenarios for what that net
 
02:26:18.510 --> 02:26:18.520 align:start position:0%
take home is going to be and where
 
02:26:20.309 --> 02:26:20.319 align:start position:0%
you're going to zero out on your on your
 
02:26:22.510 --> 02:26:22.520 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount we can certainly
 
02:26:23.830 --> 02:26:23.840 align:start position:0%
look I mean I think you you want to stay
 
02:26:25.830 --> 02:26:25.840 align:start position:0%
away from obviously um providing a
 
02:26:30.030 --> 02:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
scenario where an individual um well I
 
02:26:32.230 --> 02:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
can't say this it's you're the ones who
 
02:26:34.190 --> 02:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
make this decision but at some point you
 
02:26:36.990 --> 02:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
don't want to create um for for someone
 
02:26:38.349 --> 02:26:38.359 align:start position:0%
that is separated from full-time
 
02:26:40.590 --> 02:26:40.600 align:start position:0%
employment and U Mr Summers might
 
02:26:42.349 --> 02:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
disagree with me from the hospitality
 
02:26:45.150 --> 02:26:45.160 align:start position:0%
industry if he's still here um but you
 
02:26:46.429 --> 02:26:46.439 align:start position:0%
want to encourage them back to full-time
 
02:26:49.309 --> 02:26:49.319 align:start position:0%
employment M um right you don't want to
 
02:26:51.389 --> 02:26:51.399 align:start position:0%
cause an exhaustion issue with someone
 
02:26:54.349 --> 02:26:54.359 align:start position:0%
is taking that 427 to the full extent
 
02:26:56.510 --> 02:26:56.520 align:start position:0%
that they can um and combining that with
 
02:26:59.150 --> 02:26:59.160 align:start position:0%
part-time earnings um and run that out
 
02:27:01.070 --> 02:27:01.080 align:start position:0%
the 26 weeks we want people back to
 
02:27:02.750 --> 02:27:02.760 align:start position:0%
full-time employment for those that were
 
02:27:04.230 --> 02:27:04.240 align:start position:0%
separated from full-time employment
 
02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:05.560 align:start position:0%
that's what the that's what the economy
 
02:27:08.070 --> 02:27:08.080 align:start position:0%
needs thank you that's exactly what I
 
02:27:10.790 --> 02:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
was trying to get at thanks other
 
02:27:15.550 --> 02:27:15.560 align:start position:0%
representative Brian thank you um as I
 
02:27:17.630 --> 02:27:17.640 align:start position:0%
understand this um you will continue
 
02:27:21.630 --> 02:27:21.640 align:start position:0%
receiving a benefit um for part-time
 
02:27:21.640 --> 02:27:23.230 align:start position:0%
receiving a benefit um for part-time
employment

02:27:23.230 --> 02:27:23.240 align:start position:0%
employment
 
02:27:26.950 --> 02:27:26.960 align:start position:0%
until um 40% of your earnings is equal
 
02:27:30.590 --> 02:27:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:34.790 --> 02:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:37.309 --> 02:27:37.319 align:start position:0%
that I can comment and tell you how the
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
current system works um but you guys get
 
02:27:42.469 --> 02:27:42.479 align:start position:0%
to make the decision whether or not
 
02:27:44.990 --> 02:27:45.000 align:start position:0%
that's the right policy okay I'm just
 
02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm searching for the down I mean
 
02:27:48.670 --> 02:27:48.680 align:start position:0%
it's different it's different because as
 
02:27:51.870 --> 02:27:51.880 align:start position:0%
you pointed out um 40% of your first
 
02:27:54.349 --> 02:27:54.359 align:start position:0%
dollar of part-time employment is uh
 
02:27:57.389 --> 02:27:57.399 align:start position:0%
deducted from your benefit it's also uh
 
02:28:00.910 --> 02:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
different because you can exceed the 30%
 
02:28:03.190 --> 02:28:03.200 align:start position:0%
and still continue getting a benefit so
 
02:28:07.750 --> 02:28:07.760 align:start position:0%
you'll get a benefit until your um uh
 
02:28:09.990 --> 02:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
your earnings are equal to or greater
 
02:28:13.510 --> 02:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
than your your um weekly benefit um
 
02:28:16.830 --> 02:28:16.840 align:start position:0%
which I'm I'm assuming 427 but um could
 
02:28:19.030 --> 02:28:19.040 align:start position:0%
be less than that if if the
 
02:28:20.990 --> 02:28:21.000 align:start position:0%
circumstances are such okay thank you
 
02:28:22.630 --> 02:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so that impact is is different you
 
02:28:24.429 --> 02:28:24.439 align:start position:0%
know with the The Proposal the the
 
02:28:28.110 --> 02:28:28.120 align:start position:0%
impact is different on that person
 
02:28:31.790 --> 02:28:31.800 align:start position:0%
who has um less part-time employment
 
02:28:33.150 --> 02:28:33.160 align:start position:0%
right because right now perhaps they're
 
02:28:34.309 --> 02:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
not having any impact on their
 
02:28:36.110 --> 02:28:36.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit but I think in what
 
02:28:38.150 --> 02:28:38.160 align:start position:0%
I heard from the sponsor was he wants to
 
02:28:40.630 --> 02:28:40.640 align:start position:0%
incentivize more more work more more
 
02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
part-time employment and so as you get
 
02:28:44.309 --> 02:28:44.319 align:start position:0%
up into higher earnings that's where you
 
02:28:47.269 --> 02:28:47.279 align:start position:0%
would have a a a positive impact
 
02:28:49.150 --> 02:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
um from from this bill and you'd be and
 
02:28:50.510 --> 02:28:50.520 align:start position:0%
you'd be holding on to more of it but
 
02:28:52.590 --> 02:28:52.600 align:start position:0%
your first 40 um you know your first
 
02:28:54.150 --> 02:28:54.160 align:start position:0%
dollar 40 cents of that would reduce
 
02:28:58.429 --> 02:28:58.439 align:start position:0%
your B that oh and and essentially you
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate the
 
02:29:02.230 --> 02:29:02.240 align:start position:0%
cliff there there's there's no Cliff you
 
02:29:06.429 --> 02:29:06.439 align:start position:0%
continue getting a benefit um far uh
 
02:29:08.550 --> 02:29:08.560 align:start position:0%
further into your part-time
 
02:29:10.670 --> 02:29:10.680 align:start position:0%
earnings you change the cliff I don't
 
02:29:12.630 --> 02:29:12.640 align:start position:0%
think you eliminate it but the cliff now
 
02:29:15.510 --> 02:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
I think you always have a cliff would be
 
02:29:15.520 --> 02:29:17.710 align:start position:0%
I think you always have a cliff would be
$427

02:29:17.710 --> 02:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
$427
 
02:29:19.510 --> 02:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
you you you change the cliff but anytime
 
02:29:22.750 --> 02:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
you're you're um anytime there's a
 
02:29:24.349 --> 02:29:24.359 align:start position:0%
disregard I think you're creating some
 
02:29:24.359 --> 02:29:27.910 align:start position:0%
disregard I think you're creating some
Cliff

02:29:27.910 --> 02:29:27.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:29:31.790 --> 02:29:31.800 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chair so earlier my
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
question actually isn't the same as what
 
02:29:39.190 --> 02:29:39.200 align:start position:0%
the bill addresses at all I think um
 
02:29:42.070 --> 02:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
this addresses part-time and other
 
02:29:45.110 --> 02:29:45.120 align:start position:0%
scenarios but what about you said that
 
02:29:47.070 --> 02:29:47.080 align:start position:0%
the federal law
 
02:29:49.429 --> 02:29:49.439 align:start position:0%
required um if someone obviously has a
 
02:29:53.630 --> 02:29:53.640 align:start position:0%
full-time job that um isn't what is
 
02:29:56.110 --> 02:29:56.120 align:start position:0%
addressed with this bill but what about
 
02:30:00.790 --> 02:30:00.800 align:start position:0%
if it's a short-term gig for example
 
02:30:04.670 --> 02:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
when I this happened to me in uh
 
02:30:08.910 --> 02:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
2011 um I had a job that lasted just a
 
02:30:12.110 --> 02:30:12.120 align:start position:0%
month after I'd been unemployed and you
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
know was relatively in my career
 
02:30:16.630 --> 02:30:16.640 align:start position:0%
whatever but when I went back on
 
02:30:18.070 --> 02:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
unemployment because I didn't have
 
02:30:20.790 --> 02:30:20.800 align:start position:0%
another job lined up it put me into a
 
02:30:23.710 --> 02:30:23.720 align:start position:0%
different quarter and it refigured
 
02:30:27.870 --> 02:30:27.880 align:start position:0%
everything and it was a significant ding
 
02:30:30.550 --> 02:30:30.560 align:start position:0%
than other than if I had stayed and not
 
02:30:34.550 --> 02:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
taken that job um there was that's a
 
02:30:35.630 --> 02:30:35.640 align:start position:0%
different kind of
 
02:30:38.590 --> 02:30:38.600 align:start position:0%
penalty is that something that can be
 
02:30:41.910 --> 02:30:41.920 align:start position:0%
addressed as well potentially is a
 
02:30:43.990 --> 02:30:44.000 align:start position:0%
similar I hope people understand what
 
02:30:46.990 --> 02:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
I'm saying it I know you get it
 
02:30:49.870 --> 02:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
um and so I think with you with the um
 
02:30:51.870 --> 02:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
the short-term employment representative
 
02:30:54.230 --> 02:30:54.240 align:start position:0%
that you had taken um was that taken
 
02:30:57.830 --> 02:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
after you were you were separated from a
 
02:30:59.389 --> 02:30:59.399 align:start position:0%
another job and for which you were
 
02:31:00.790 --> 02:31:00.800 align:start position:0%
receiving unemployment benefits for and
 
02:31:02.950 --> 02:31:02.960 align:start position:0%
then I took a short-term gig that lasted
 
02:31:05.790 --> 02:31:05.800 align:start position:0%
about a month um and had a set ending
 
02:31:08.150 --> 02:31:08.160 align:start position:0%
date when I took that job so it was a
 
02:31:10.630 --> 02:31:10.640 align:start position:0%
full-time job for a month but that was
 
02:31:12.429 --> 02:31:12.439 align:start position:0%
considered regular employment at that
 
02:31:15.110 --> 02:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
point and I was considered at the time
 
02:31:18.070 --> 02:31:18.080 align:start position:0%
to not be employed anymore so then when
 
02:31:20.389 --> 02:31:20.399 align:start position:0%
I went back on unemployment having not
 
02:31:23.630 --> 02:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
lined it was a tough year 2011 um you
 
02:31:25.870 --> 02:31:25.880 align:start position:0%
know having not lined up a job because
 
02:31:28.070 --> 02:31:28.080 align:start position:0%
it put me into the next quarter for
 
02:31:31.150 --> 02:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
redetermination it was a new claim this
 
02:31:33.389 --> 02:31:33.399 align:start position:0%
is for to help explain it to folks it's
 
02:31:35.269 --> 02:31:35.279 align:start position:0%
a it was a brand new claim even though I
 
02:31:37.469 --> 02:31:37.479 align:start position:0%
knew going into that job yeah does that
 
02:31:39.790 --> 02:31:39.800 align:start position:0%
make sense yeah so the way that ways
 
02:31:42.230 --> 02:31:42.240 align:start position:0%
significant reduction in the amount of
 
02:31:45.190 --> 02:31:45.200 align:start position:0%
of weekly benefits that I could receive
 
02:31:46.469 --> 02:31:46.479 align:start position:0%
after that point it would have been
 
02:31:48.429 --> 02:31:48.439 align:start position:0%
better actually in terms of the
 
02:31:51.030 --> 02:31:51.040 align:start position:0%
incentives it would have been better for
 
02:31:51.040 --> 02:31:51.870 align:start position:0%
incentives it would have been better for
me

02:31:51.870 --> 02:31:51.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
02:31:53.990 --> 02:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
financially given that it still took me
 
02:31:56.309 --> 02:31:56.319 align:start position:0%
a while to get a job in my career in my
 
02:32:00.030 --> 02:32:00.040 align:start position:0%
field um that was long term um to have
 
02:32:02.550 --> 02:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
not taken the month-long job even though
 
02:32:04.990 --> 02:32:05.000 align:start position:0%
it was the right thing to do for me
 
02:32:07.110 --> 02:32:07.120 align:start position:0%
personally psychologically and
 
02:32:09.469 --> 02:32:09.479 align:start position:0%
everything else um is that something
 
02:32:11.870 --> 02:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
that could be addressed in a in
 
02:32:13.830 --> 02:32:13.840 align:start position:0%
something like this bill and perhaps as
 
02:32:15.950 --> 02:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
an addition to this bill if that is
 
02:32:18.110 --> 02:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
something that could be changed if we
 
02:32:18.120 --> 02:32:18.910 align:start position:0%
something that could be changed if we
wanted

02:32:18.910 --> 02:32:18.920 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
to um so this bill doesn't address that
 
02:32:23.309 --> 02:32:23.319 align:start position:0%
but you
 
02:32:26.030 --> 02:32:26.040 align:start position:0%
know speaking from experience the the
 
02:32:28.309 --> 02:32:28.319 align:start position:0%
timing of our unemployment is never good
 
02:32:32.550 --> 02:32:32.560 align:start position:0%
right um and what you're describing is
 
02:32:34.550 --> 02:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
how the current weekly benefit amount is
 
02:32:36.790 --> 02:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
calculated so when we had looked at the
 
02:32:38.590 --> 02:32:38.600 align:start position:0%
the chart that's proposed to be changed
 
02:32:41.309 --> 02:32:41.319 align:start position:0%
by representative McKenzie um the your
 
02:32:43.190 --> 02:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
weekly benefit amount is determined by
 
02:32:46.590 --> 02:32:46.600 align:start position:0%
your earnings in the first four of the
 
02:32:49.230 --> 02:32:49.240 align:start position:0%
most recently completed five calendar
 
02:32:51.590 --> 02:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
quarters okay and what the department
 
02:32:56.309 --> 02:32:56.319 align:start position:0%
currently does so if you do not have um
 
02:32:59.469 --> 02:32:59.479 align:start position:0%
um minimum adequate earnings in the
 
02:33:01.150 --> 02:33:01.160 align:start position:0%
first four of the most recently
 
02:33:03.870 --> 02:33:03.880 align:start position:0%
completed five calendar quarters we will
 
02:33:06.630 --> 02:33:06.640 align:start position:0%
look at the most recent four completed
 
02:33:08.510 --> 02:33:08.520 align:start position:0%
calendar quarters so if you didn't have
 
02:33:12.269 --> 02:33:12.279 align:start position:0%
2,800 bucks in the first four um and 14
 
02:33:14.750 --> 02:33:14.760 align:start position:0%
in in uh each and of two separate
 
02:33:16.870 --> 02:33:16.880 align:start position:0%
quarters we will look to what we call an
 
02:33:18.790 --> 02:33:18.800 align:start position:0%
alternative base period and we'll look
 
02:33:20.990 --> 02:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
at the the most recent four completed
 
02:33:23.550 --> 02:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
quarters but you're always looking at
 
02:33:25.550 --> 02:33:25.560 align:start position:0%
four completed quarters in order to
 
02:33:27.190 --> 02:33:27.200 align:start position:0%
determine what that weekly benefit
 
02:33:29.429 --> 02:33:29.439 align:start position:0%
amount is going to be and if you are in
 
02:33:33.349 --> 02:33:33.359 align:start position:0%
a situation where you um are unemployed
 
02:33:35.910 --> 02:33:35.920 align:start position:0%
through no fault of your own um after a
 
02:33:39.429 --> 02:33:39.439 align:start position:0%
short stint of employment um that prior
 
02:33:41.630 --> 02:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
four quarters like you described might
 
02:33:44.670 --> 02:33:44.680 align:start position:0%
not be uh very good in terms of what
 
02:33:46.670 --> 02:33:46.680 align:start position:0%
your total earnings were but that's how
 
02:33:47.870 --> 02:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
we determine it right now it's your
 
02:33:50.630 --> 02:33:50.640 align:start position:0%
total earnings and covered employment W2
 
02:33:52.830 --> 02:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
employment your total earnings in the
 
02:33:54.349 --> 02:33:54.359 align:start position:0%
first four of the most recently
 
02:33:56.469 --> 02:33:56.479 align:start position:0%
completed five calendar quarters so if
 
02:33:58.550 --> 02:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
you wanted to change that it would have
 
02:34:01.870 --> 02:34:01.880 align:start position:0%
to be uh changing the the way in which
 
02:34:05.309 --> 02:34:05.319 align:start position:0%
the base period is used and how um it
 
02:34:07.429 --> 02:34:07.439 align:start position:0%
then correlates to a weekly benefit
 
02:34:09.349 --> 02:34:09.359 align:start position:0%
amount follow
 
02:34:14.030 --> 02:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
up thank you um so would we knowing that
 
02:34:15.590 --> 02:34:15.600 align:start position:0%
there's a federal implication
 
02:34:15.600 --> 02:34:16.750 align:start position:0%
there's a federal implication
potentially

02:34:16.750 --> 02:34:16.760 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
could we um Implement a freeze KN if
 
02:34:23.230 --> 02:34:23.240 align:start position:0%
someone accepted a short-term job that
 
02:34:24.830 --> 02:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
was good in their field and the pay blah
 
02:34:27.389 --> 02:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
blah blah to avoid this sort of penalty
 
02:34:28.630 --> 02:34:28.640 align:start position:0%
in the way that these things are
 
02:34:31.429 --> 02:34:31.439 align:start position:0%
determined by the quarters could we put
 
02:34:33.830 --> 02:34:33.840 align:start position:0%
a freeze on it if someone took a job
 
02:34:37.550 --> 02:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
knowing it had a set in date so you know
 
02:34:40.429 --> 02:34:40.439 align:start position:0%
similar to my experience if someone took
 
02:34:40.439 --> 02:34:41.110 align:start position:0%
similar to my experience if someone took
a

02:34:41.110 --> 02:34:41.120 align:start position:0%
a
 
02:34:43.389 --> 02:34:43.399 align:start position:0%
month-long job that they knew was going
 
02:34:47.230 --> 02:34:47.240 align:start position:0%
to end on the 31st day
 
02:34:49.590 --> 02:34:49.600 align:start position:0%
would we legally be allowed as a state
 
02:34:53.070 --> 02:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
to address that um to avoid the sort of
 
02:34:54.990 --> 02:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
penalty that would come in that scenario
 
02:34:57.190 --> 02:34:57.200 align:start position:0%
because it is very similar it's
 
02:35:01.630 --> 02:35:01.640 align:start position:0%
basically deinen diviz work at a time we
 
02:35:03.429 --> 02:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
you know it's so many for so many
 
02:35:05.950 --> 02:35:05.960 align:start position:0%
reasons better to have even a month-long
 
02:35:07.910 --> 02:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
gig is
 
02:35:11.070 --> 02:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
better can't are we to your
 
02:35:12.990 --> 02:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
understanding of how it is federally
 
02:35:14.750 --> 02:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
could we put a freeze on that
 
02:35:16.950 --> 02:35:16.960 align:start position:0%
unemployment so that someone isn't
 
02:35:20.349 --> 02:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
penalized based on the way the
 
02:35:23.429 --> 02:35:23.439 align:start position:0%
quarters you um with every proposal we
 
02:35:24.830 --> 02:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
we submitted to the US Department of
 
02:35:26.590 --> 02:35:26.600 align:start position:0%
Labor for their review to see if it's in
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
compliance and Conformity with with
 
02:35:30.070 --> 02:35:30.080 align:start position:0%
Federal requirements um so I can't
 
02:35:32.550 --> 02:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
speculate as to what they would say um
 
02:35:35.830 --> 02:35:35.840 align:start position:0%
you could certainly propose something um
 
02:35:39.110 --> 02:35:39.120 align:start position:0%
the the other impacts of changing the
 
02:35:42.469 --> 02:35:42.479 align:start position:0%
base period so right now if I if you're
 
02:35:44.550 --> 02:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
in a short-term employment that's less
 
02:35:47.030 --> 02:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
than 12 weeks and your and you're
 
02:35:48.830 --> 02:35:48.840 align:start position:0%
separated through no fault of your own
 
02:35:50.950 --> 02:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
and you qualify for unemployment the
 
02:35:53.790 --> 02:35:53.800 align:start position:0%
benefits paid out to you are not uh
 
02:35:55.870 --> 02:35:55.880 align:start position:0%
counted against that employer's
 
02:35:59.110 --> 02:35:59.120 align:start position:0%
experience okay um if it's above 12
 
02:36:02.630 --> 02:36:02.640 align:start position:0%
weeks they are so what could happen here
 
02:36:06.429 --> 02:36:06.439 align:start position:0%
is because in the usual situation the
 
02:36:08.910 --> 02:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
benefits paid out are going to be
 
02:36:11.070 --> 02:36:11.080 align:start position:0%
counted against the experience of your
 
02:36:13.269 --> 02:36:13.279 align:start position:0%
most recent employer in most instances
 
02:36:15.309 --> 02:36:15.319 align:start position:0%
that's your separating employer corre
 
02:36:17.510 --> 02:36:17.520 align:start position:0%
right so New Hampshire is a is a most
 
02:36:21.230 --> 02:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
recent employer M State okay um and so
 
02:36:23.190 --> 02:36:23.200 align:start position:0%
it's that employer's experience that
 
02:36:25.510 --> 02:36:25.520 align:start position:0%
takes a negative hit as a result of
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
those benefits being paid out if now
 
02:36:31.710 --> 02:36:31.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to move your your um
 
02:36:34.230 --> 02:36:34.240 align:start position:0%
separation further into the future and
 
02:36:38.590 --> 02:36:38.600 align:start position:0%
I'm going to be going further back to um
 
02:36:40.710 --> 02:36:40.720 align:start position:0%
have a negative impact on the experience
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
of a of a of an employer from further
 
02:36:45.910 --> 02:36:45.920 align:start position:0%
back in history that employer might
 
02:36:47.389 --> 02:36:47.399 align:start position:0%
might cry foul because they're saying
 
02:36:48.870 --> 02:36:48.880 align:start position:0%
wait a minute I didn't have anything to
 
02:36:51.150 --> 02:36:51.160 align:start position:0%
do with that subsequent loss of
 
02:36:53.910 --> 02:36:53.920 align:start position:0%
employment but yet my experience is
 
02:36:57.030 --> 02:36:57.040 align:start position:0%
being negatively impacted by it um what
 
02:36:59.269 --> 02:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
what we do in some situations you know
 
02:37:00.590 --> 02:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
in our statute we have a bunch of
 
02:37:02.670 --> 02:37:02.680 align:start position:0%
voluntary quit exclusions right where
 
02:37:04.550 --> 02:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
you can quit employment for certain
 
02:37:06.389 --> 02:37:06.399 align:start position:0%
reasons like a domestic violence
 
02:37:08.950 --> 02:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
situation or um with certain types of
 
02:37:12.590 --> 02:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
non-work related um injuries um we don't
 
02:37:14.870 --> 02:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
charge the most recent employer for
 
02:37:16.510 --> 02:37:16.520 align:start position:0%
those benefits they get charged against
 
02:37:18.790 --> 02:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
the fund so they get shared by all
 
02:37:21.070 --> 02:37:21.080 align:start position:0%
employers um it's still a burden on the
 
02:37:24.429 --> 02:37:24.439 align:start position:0%
fund um but we don't hit the experience
 
02:37:26.790 --> 02:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
of that employer but if you go if you if
 
02:37:29.389 --> 02:37:29.399 align:start position:0%
you're going to move the the uh base
 
02:37:31.349 --> 02:37:31.359 align:start position:0%
period around you're going to have that
 
02:37:32.710 --> 02:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
issue where an employer is going to be
 
02:37:34.309 --> 02:37:34.319 align:start position:0%
hit for benefits where they had nothing
 
02:37:44.790 --> 02:37:44.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:44.800 --> 02:37:52.429 align:start position:0%
 
them

02:37:52.429 --> 02:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:54.269 --> 02:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
thank you it's actually not even a
 
02:37:56.510 --> 02:37:56.520 align:start position:0%
question I was just I think
 
02:37:57.750 --> 02:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
representative seaworth was doing it too
 
02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:00.720 align:start position:0%
we just did the math out and so if it's
 
02:38:03.590 --> 02:38:03.600 align:start position:0%
40% of uh the total made until it
 
02:38:05.150 --> 02:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
basically evens itself out it seems like
 
02:38:07.190 --> 02:38:07.200 align:start position:0%
it'll be roughly
 
02:38:10.070 --> 02:38:10.080 align:start position:0%
1,070 a week for a part-time job before
 
02:38:13.110 --> 02:38:13.120 align:start position:0%
your benefits in essence get erased
 
02:38:14.510 --> 02:38:14.520 align:start position:0%
that's kind of I just want to say that
 
02:38:15.429 --> 02:38:15.439 align:start position:0%
because we're kind of talking about that
 
02:38:17.670 --> 02:38:17.680 align:start position:0%
for second but if my Math's right that's
 
02:38:22.230 --> 02:38:22.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:24.910 --> 02:38:24.920 align:start position:0%
be uh thank you Mr chair I also have a
 
02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:26.160 align:start position:0%
question for you but let me ask Mr
 
02:38:29.150 --> 02:38:29.160 align:start position:0%
labers first uh what if we just simply
 
02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
raise the Rait from 30 to 40% would that
 
02:38:34.429 --> 02:38:34.439 align:start position:0%
help quite a few
 
02:38:36.950 --> 02:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
people um well yet you'd be able to to
 
02:38:39.349 --> 02:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
hold on to more of your earnings uh well
 
02:38:41.309 --> 02:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
you'd be able to your your net take-home
 
02:38:43.590 --> 02:38:43.600 align:start position:0%
would be more right so anytime you're
 
02:38:45.830 --> 02:38:45.840 align:start position:0%
increasing that 30% disregard now you'll
 
02:38:48.349 --> 02:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
be able to earn more before it reduces
 
02:38:50.070 --> 02:38:50.080 align:start position:0%
your unemployment benefit and when you
 
02:38:51.990 --> 02:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
when you combine those part-time
 
02:38:53.309 --> 02:38:53.319 align:start position:0%
earnings and your your weekly
 
02:38:55.030 --> 02:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit you're going to be
 
02:38:56.230 --> 02:38:56.240 align:start position:0%
you know at the end of the week you're
 
02:38:58.150 --> 02:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
going to have more than you would under
 
02:39:00.630 --> 02:39:00.640 align:start position:0%
the current 30% system and you're still
 
02:39:02.710 --> 02:39:02.720 align:start position:0%
interested in finding work more work
 
02:39:05.230 --> 02:39:05.240 align:start position:0%
because this isn't quite enough
 
02:39:10.630 --> 02:39:10.640 align:start position:0%
either I would think so yes Mr chair um
 
02:39:14.150 --> 02:39:14.160 align:start position:0%
were any of those 125 beans magic beans
 
02:39:15.190 --> 02:39:15.200 align:start position:0%
because that could change the whole
 
02:39:15.200 --> 02:39:25.510 align:start position:0%
because that could change the whole
equation

02:39:25.510 --> 02:39:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:26.910 --> 02:39:26.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you uh thank you for taking my
 
02:39:28.670 --> 02:39:28.680 align:start position:0%
question so this should be a simple one
 
02:39:30.389 --> 02:39:30.399 align:start position:0%
uh there's varying definitions of
 
02:39:32.190 --> 02:39:32.200 align:start position:0%
fulltime depending on industry what's
 
02:39:35.030 --> 02:39:35.040 align:start position:0%
the def what is it 40 hours for this no
 
02:39:37.710 --> 02:39:37.720 align:start position:0%
it is not it's uh 37 and a half 37 and a
 
02:39:39.790 --> 02:39:39.800 align:start position:0%
half thank you anything under 37 and
 
02:39:41.389 --> 02:39:41.399 align:start position:0%
half is considered parttime can I do a
 
02:39:45.190 --> 02:39:45.200 align:start position:0%
followup yes um what is uh the what is
 
02:39:47.950 --> 02:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
typical for part-time work in New
 
02:39:51.030 --> 02:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'm unable to answer that
 
02:39:53.150 --> 02:39:53.160 align:start position:0%
because what we receive from uh
 
02:39:55.070 --> 02:39:55.080 align:start position:0%
employers on a quarterly basis does not
 
02:39:57.309 --> 02:39:57.319 align:start position:0%
include that information so we have very
 
02:39:59.830 --> 02:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
minimal uh tax and wage reports in terms
 
02:40:02.070 --> 02:40:02.080 align:start position:0%
of the content so an employer only
 
02:40:04.830 --> 02:40:04.840 align:start position:0%
reports um your last name first initial
 
02:40:06.750 --> 02:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
your social and the total wages paid
 
02:40:08.150 --> 02:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
during that quarter I don't know if it's
 
02:40:10.269 --> 02:40:10.279 align:start position:0%
part-time full-time I don't know know
 
02:40:13.309 --> 02:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
whether um that worker is male female I
 
02:40:15.269 --> 02:40:15.279 align:start position:0%
don't know how many hours they worked um
 
02:40:17.550 --> 02:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
so a lot that we don't know um you're
 
02:40:19.349 --> 02:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
able to get some of that through Bureau
 
02:40:21.710 --> 02:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
labor statistic survey data but it's not
 
02:40:23.269 --> 02:40:23.279 align:start position:0%
directly from the administrative records
 
02:40:34.269 --> 02:40:34.279 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:36.590 --> 02:40:36.600 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
02:40:39.349 --> 02:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
again uh Deputy Commissioner um on line
 
02:40:41.670 --> 02:40:41.680 align:start position:0%
11 we're looking to remove um the
 
02:40:43.710 --> 02:40:43.720 align:start position:0%
definition of wages and earnings and
 
02:40:49.110 --> 02:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:51.309 --> 02:40:51.319 align:start position:0%
we also under line eight as say earnings
 
02:40:53.190 --> 02:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
from self-employment so anybody that has
 
02:40:55.670 --> 02:40:55.680 align:start position:0%
a business has earnings we don't make
 
02:41:00.030 --> 02:41:00.040 align:start position:0%
wages um we be moving that allow people
 
02:41:02.870 --> 02:41:02.880 align:start position:0%
to have become self-employed no longer
 
02:41:06.230 --> 02:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
report their earnings and still claim um
 
02:41:08.510 --> 02:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
unemployment full unemployment
 
02:41:12.030 --> 02:41:12.040 align:start position:0%
benefits um I'm I'm not sure what the
 
02:41:13.830 --> 02:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
what the intent is of that particular
 
02:41:15.550 --> 02:41:15.560 align:start position:0%
change in in this amended version the
 
02:41:17.950 --> 02:41:17.960 align:start position:0%
the initial the the original version
 
02:41:20.429 --> 02:41:20.439 align:start position:0%
actually struck um self-employment from
 
02:41:22.469 --> 02:41:22.479 align:start position:0%
being considered uh for the earnings
 
02:41:23.990 --> 02:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
from self-employment and the department
 
02:41:26.309 --> 02:41:26.319 align:start position:0%
would have had major concerns with that
 
02:41:27.750 --> 02:41:27.760 align:start position:0%
because um you would have been
 
02:41:29.269 --> 02:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
essentially allowing an individual to
 
02:41:31.150 --> 02:41:31.160 align:start position:0%
have unlimited self-employment earnings
 
02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
and still collect their full
 
02:41:34.110 --> 02:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment benefit I don't think
 
02:41:36.590 --> 02:41:36.600 align:start position:0%
that's um the intent of the the
 
02:41:38.110 --> 02:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
unemployment program that provides
 
02:41:40.510 --> 02:41:40.520 align:start position:0%
temporary partial wage replacement thank
 
02:41:42.870 --> 02:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
you and a quick followup Mr
 
02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:44.429 align:start position:0%
you and a quick followup Mr
chairman

02:41:44.429 --> 02:41:44.439 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:41:47.750 --> 02:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
um if the bill on line 17 and 18 goes
 
02:41:49.590 --> 02:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
through as written uh would it be
 
02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
incentivize employeers to get rid of
 
02:41:52.990 --> 02:41:53.000 align:start position:0%
their layoff or fire their full-time
 
02:41:54.870 --> 02:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
employees put them on unemployment
 
02:41:56.110 --> 02:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
benefits and then rehire them as
 
02:41:56.120 --> 02:41:57.550 align:start position:0%
benefits and then rehire them as
part-time

02:41:57.550 --> 02:41:57.560 align:start position:0%
part-time
 
02:41:59.710 --> 02:41:59.720 align:start position:0%
employees um well we have a program that
 
02:42:02.630 --> 02:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
does that um so employers right now if
 
02:42:04.790 --> 02:42:04.800 align:start position:0%
they're looking at like a just a a
 
02:42:07.150 --> 02:42:07.160 align:start position:0%
temporary work reduction um where they
 
02:42:08.469 --> 02:42:08.479 align:start position:0%
can they can participate in our work
 
02:42:10.750 --> 02:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
share program um which is much more
 
02:42:13.870 --> 02:42:13.880 align:start position:0%
beneficial for them rather than um going
 
02:42:15.950 --> 02:42:15.960 align:start position:0%
through the actual layoff and then bring
 
02:42:18.830 --> 02:42:18.840 align:start position:0%
people back part-time um so we have a
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
program that incentivizes employers to
 
02:42:23.750 --> 02:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
to reduce the amount of uh if they need
 
02:42:25.590 --> 02:42:25.600 align:start position:0%
to reduce the amount of hours people can
 
02:42:27.150 --> 02:42:27.160 align:start position:0%
collect a portion of their unemployment
 
02:42:29.269 --> 02:42:29.279 align:start position:0%
benefit the employer has to continue to
 
02:42:31.710 --> 02:42:31.720 align:start position:0%
provide them with Benefits um to the
 
02:42:34.269 --> 02:42:34.279 align:start position:0%
extent they did previously um but we we
 
02:42:36.429 --> 02:42:36.439 align:start position:0%
encourage employers into that program
 
02:42:38.590 --> 02:42:38.600 align:start position:0%
rather than doing um the scenario that
 
02:42:40.630 --> 02:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
you just described thank you and one
 
02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
final one um and the final one uh Deputy
 
02:42:47.670 --> 02:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
Commissioner is um if there is 40%
 
02:42:49.830 --> 02:42:49.840 align:start position:0%
incentive um and we have the duration
 
02:42:52.910 --> 02:42:52.920 align:start position:0%
increase in the trust fund which means
 
02:42:54.469 --> 02:42:54.479 align:start position:0%
we'll lower the value which increase
 
02:42:57.269 --> 02:42:57.279 align:start position:0%
taxes on the employers would that be a
 
02:42:57.279 --> 02:42:59.070 align:start position:0%
taxes on the employers would that be a
reasonable

02:42:59.070 --> 02:42:59.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
02:43:03.389 --> 02:43:03.399 align:start position:0%
assumption um yeah I think any any um
 
02:43:06.070 --> 02:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
change to that 30% disregard is going to
 
02:43:07.590 --> 02:43:07.600 align:start position:0%
is going to result in some additional
 
02:43:09.990 --> 02:43:10.000 align:start position:0%
benefits being paid out uh from the the
 
02:43:12.150 --> 02:43:12.160 align:start position:0%
trust fund we had described and I won't
 
02:43:13.670 --> 02:43:13.680 align:start position:0%
go through it again but we had described
 
02:43:15.910 --> 02:43:15.920 align:start position:0%
why that's very difficult to
 
02:43:17.510 --> 02:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
with any degree of accuracy in
 
02:43:20.070 --> 02:43:20.080 align:start position:0%
forecasting out that impact um in the
 
02:43:21.630 --> 02:43:21.640 align:start position:0%
language that we included in the fiscal
 
02:43:23.830 --> 02:43:23.840 align:start position:0%
note but there would be an impact right
 
02:43:26.710 --> 02:43:26.720 align:start position:0%
you're um similar to the other changes
 
02:43:28.550 --> 02:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
which have been withdrawn where we where
 
02:43:30.950 --> 02:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
we weren't going to consider all all
 
02:43:32.590 --> 02:43:32.600 align:start position:0%
different types of Separation payments
 
02:43:34.830 --> 02:43:34.840 align:start position:0%
as deductible and delaying your receipt
 
02:43:37.070 --> 02:43:37.080 align:start position:0%
of unemployment benefits if you increase
 
02:43:39.510 --> 02:43:39.520 align:start position:0%
your disregard the 30% disregard it's
 
02:43:42.070 --> 02:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
going to accelerate uh the payment of
 
02:43:44.190 --> 02:43:44.200 align:start position:0%
benefits you're going to um you're going
 
02:43:46.750 --> 02:43:46.760 align:start position:0%
to hit more over that duration than you
 
02:43:48.990 --> 02:43:49.000 align:start position:0%
otherwise would have you're capped out
 
02:43:51.710 --> 02:43:51.720 align:start position:0%
you have you have a maximum amount that
 
02:43:53.710 --> 02:43:53.720 align:start position:0%
you can get which is your weekly benefit
 
02:43:57.469 --> 02:43:57.479 align:start position:0%
amount multiplied by 26 so for that 427
 
02:43:59.309 --> 02:43:59.319 align:start position:0%
person they're they're maxing out at
 
02:44:02.710 --> 02:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
about 11 Grand just just over um so you
 
02:44:05.070 --> 02:44:05.080 align:start position:0%
might be hitting that full maximum
 
02:44:08.469 --> 02:44:08.479 align:start position:0%
benefit sooner or a higher amount sooner
 
02:44:10.269 --> 02:44:10.279 align:start position:0%
um if you know we're we're making
 
02:44:12.550 --> 02:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
changes to the current disregard thank
 
02:44:14.190 --> 02:44:14.200 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
 
02:44:14.200 --> 02:44:22.110 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr
chairman

02:44:22.110 --> 02:44:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:24.469 --> 02:44:24.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair uh how many chucks
 
02:44:27.190 --> 02:44:27.200 align:start position:0%
with a wood chuck no no
 
02:44:30.510 --> 02:44:30.520 align:start position:0%
um looking at the if you're if you're
 
02:44:32.630 --> 02:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
doing some parttime work and that's say
 
02:44:35.950 --> 02:44:35.960 align:start position:0%
W2 work is that is that not paying into
 
02:44:39.429 --> 02:44:39.439 align:start position:0%
the trust fund no it is no very very
 
02:44:41.790 --> 02:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
good point um
 
02:44:45.389 --> 02:44:45.399 align:start position:0%
all all W2 earnings are required to be
 
02:44:47.990 --> 02:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
reported um or wages are required to be
 
02:44:49.469 --> 02:44:49.479 align:start position:0%
reported by that employer for the
 
02:44:51.830 --> 02:44:51.840 align:start position:0%
quarter in which they are paid whether
 
02:44:54.190 --> 02:44:54.200 align:start position:0%
or not um so if
 
02:44:58.349 --> 02:44:58.359 align:start position:0%
I'm uh say I have multiple jobs okay I'm
 
02:45:00.630 --> 02:45:00.640 align:start position:0%
going to be U I'm going to have multiple
 
02:45:04.349 --> 02:45:04.359 align:start position:0%
$14,000 taxable wage bases right so um
 
02:45:07.030 --> 02:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
depending on when I hit my $144,000
 
02:45:11.190 --> 02:45:11.200 align:start position:0%
taxable wage base per job is determined
 
02:45:13.389 --> 02:45:13.399 align:start position:0%
whether or not any of those earnings are
 
02:45:15.510 --> 02:45:15.520 align:start position:0%
taxable so the earnings still have to be
 
02:45:17.790 --> 02:45:17.800 align:start position:0%
reported the employer still has to pay
 
02:45:20.870 --> 02:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
at their tax rate on the first 14,000 in
 
02:45:24.349 --> 02:45:24.359 align:start position:0%
annual earnings um so depending on what
 
02:45:25.830 --> 02:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
I've how much I've worked and how much
 
02:45:27.429 --> 02:45:27.439 align:start position:0%
I've earned the dollars that you're
 
02:45:29.510 --> 02:45:29.520 align:start position:0%
talking about might be dollars that are
 
02:45:31.230 --> 02:45:31.240 align:start position:0%
no longer taxable because we already hit
 
02:45:44.070 --> 02:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:44.080 --> 02:46:13.990 align:start position:0%
 
you

02:46:13.990 --> 02:46:14.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:14.000 --> 03:21:07.349 align:start position:0%
 
sure

03:21:07.349 --> 03:21:07.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:09.030 --> 03:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
for everybody waiting for the next bill
 
03:21:11.389 --> 03:21:11.399 align:start position:0%
we kind of ran over on the previous bill
 
03:21:11.399 --> 03:21:12.910 align:start position:0%
we kind of ran over on the previous bill
so

03:21:12.910 --> 03:21:12.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:21:15.070 --> 03:21:15.080 align:start position:0%
we'll probably wait another five minutes
 
03:21:18.469 --> 03:21:18.479 align:start position:0%
to people who are get still getting food
 
03:21:40.830 --> 03:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:40.840 --> 03:26:18.070 align:start position:0%
 
start

03:26:18.070 --> 03:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:20.189 --> 03:26:20.199 align:start position:0%

to introduce his
 
03:27:19.349 --> 03:27:19.359 align:start position:0%
bill hi thank you welcome to the labor
 
03:27:23.710 --> 03:27:23.720 align:start position:0%
committee hi um so for the record I'm
 
03:27:25.950 --> 03:27:25.960 align:start position:0%
representative Eric Gallagher
 
03:27:28.990 --> 03:27:29.000 align:start position:0%
representing Marc County District 20
 
03:27:32.229 --> 03:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
that's conquered w six which is down the
 
03:27:36.269 --> 03:27:36.279 align:start position:0%
street that ways a little um so and I'm
 
03:27:38.429 --> 03:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
here to
 
03:27:43.110 --> 03:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
introduce HB 1375 relative to Severance
 
03:27:45.030 --> 03:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
agreements requiring employees to
 
03:27:47.750 --> 03:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
broadly wave labor law
 
03:27:47.760 --> 03:27:49.269 align:start position:0%
broadly wave labor law
rights

03:27:49.269 --> 03:27:49.279 align:start position:0%
rights
 
03:27:51.309 --> 03:27:51.319 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:27:55.309 --> 03:27:55.319 align:start position:0%
basically where this bill came from was
 
03:27:59.630 --> 03:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
um I was talking with constituents about
 
03:28:02.510 --> 03:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
their workplaces and various problems
 
03:28:05.590 --> 03:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
they had with it and
 
03:28:08.469 --> 03:28:08.479 align:start position:0%
um so some of them told me some of their
 
03:28:13.309 --> 03:28:13.319 align:start position:0%
problems and um said oh man that sounds
 
03:28:15.150 --> 03:28:15.160 align:start position:0%
bad why didn't you raise a big stink
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
about it and to which they told me oh
 
03:28:20.269 --> 03:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
well I don't think I could have because
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
I had a non I had to sign a
 
03:28:22.800 --> 03:28:24.349 align:start position:0%
I had a non I had to sign a
non-disparagement

03:28:24.349 --> 03:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
non-disparagement
 
03:28:29.229 --> 03:28:29.239 align:start position:0%
agreement when um I left
 
03:28:31.830 --> 03:28:31.840 align:start position:0%
so uh
 
03:28:35.630 --> 03:28:35.640 align:start position:0%
basically yeah this this bill is meant
 
03:28:38.630 --> 03:28:38.640 align:start position:0%
to address cases like that I think
 
03:28:41.870 --> 03:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
people should be able to talk freely
 
03:28:46.429 --> 03:28:46.439 align:start position:0%
about um their
 
03:28:49.150 --> 03:28:49.160 align:start position:0%
experiences working somewhere after they
 
03:28:53.710 --> 03:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
leave it so people can get a good idea
 
03:28:57.469 --> 03:28:57.479 align:start position:0%
about what conditions are like there um
 
03:29:01.389 --> 03:29:01.399 align:start position:0%
and have the information necessary to um
 
03:29:03.389 --> 03:29:03.399 align:start position:0%
decide whether they might want
 
03:29:09.630 --> 03:29:09.640 align:start position:0%
to uh do business there themselves um so
 
03:29:12.309 --> 03:29:12.319 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think um
 
03:29:16.830 --> 03:29:16.840 align:start position:0%
since since it's up to the government to
 
03:29:19.950 --> 03:29:19.960 align:start position:0%
enforce these non-disparagement
 
03:29:22.269 --> 03:29:22.279 align:start position:0%
Clauses in
 
03:29:27.070 --> 03:29:27.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:29.870 --> 03:29:29.880 align:start position:0%
um I I I think that this could even be
 
03:29:33.670 --> 03:29:33.680 align:start position:0%
seen as a freedom of speech issue um
 
03:29:36.309 --> 03:29:36.319 align:start position:0%
since by enforcing a non-disparagement
 
03:29:39.429 --> 03:29:39.439 align:start position:0%
clause you'd be inhibiting the employees
 
03:29:42.910 --> 03:29:42.920 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech um
 
03:29:45.469 --> 03:29:45.479 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:29:47.520 --> 03:29:47.530 align:start position:0%
um also
 
03:29:47.530 --> 03:29:49.750 align:start position:0%
um also
[Music]

03:29:49.750 --> 03:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:29:53.189 --> 03:29:53.199 align:start position:0%
um what what to address the criticism
 
03:29:56.229 --> 03:29:56.239 align:start position:0%
well don't you voluntarily enter into
 
03:29:58.550 --> 03:29:58.560 align:start position:0%
contracts or something the whole point
 
03:30:00.670 --> 03:30:00.680 align:start position:0%
of leaving somewhere is that you don't
 
03:30:05.150 --> 03:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
want to do business with them anymore um
 
03:30:08.590 --> 03:30:08.600 align:start position:0%
so yeah I mean if you know you're
 
03:30:11.710 --> 03:30:11.720 align:start position:0%
basically stuck without a real Choice
 
03:30:14.750 --> 03:30:14.760 align:start position:0%
there when you want to leave somewhere
 
03:30:18.070 --> 03:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
so uh I I think
 
03:30:21.189 --> 03:30:21.199 align:start position:0%
that that that kind of distinguishes
 
03:30:23.670 --> 03:30:23.680 align:start position:0%
severance agreements from nor normal
 
03:30:23.680 --> 03:30:25.189 align:start position:0%
severance agreements from nor normal
contracts

03:30:25.189 --> 03:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
03:30:29.870 --> 03:30:29.880 align:start position:0%
um so yeah I I basically just asked OS
 
03:30:33.469 --> 03:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
to draft me a bill
 
03:30:36.349 --> 03:30:36.359 align:start position:0%
um about
 
03:30:40.070 --> 03:30:40.080 align:start position:0%
um about um yeah non-disparagement
 
03:30:41.550 --> 03:30:41.560 align:start position:0%
agreements it
 
03:30:47.150 --> 03:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
in uh Severance packages and uh this is
 
03:30:50.830 --> 03:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
the language that they drafted for me
 
03:30:55.429 --> 03:30:55.439 align:start position:0%
um so um yeah that's the bill and I'll
 
03:30:57.550 --> 03:30:57.560 align:start position:0%
take questions
 
03:31:01.030 --> 03:31:01.040 align:start position:0%
out representative Schultz thank you
 
03:31:04.189 --> 03:31:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr thank you Mr chair um to
 
03:31:05.990 --> 03:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
play Devil's
 
03:31:10.269 --> 03:31:10.279 align:start position:0%
Advocate why not steer folks who are
 
03:31:12.389 --> 03:31:12.399 align:start position:0%
frustrated with their former workplace
 
03:31:16.229 --> 03:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
to the anonymous sites like glass door I
 
03:31:17.910 --> 03:31:17.920 align:start position:0%
don't know if you've heard of glass door
 
03:31:21.110 --> 03:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
yeah um
 
03:31:24.189 --> 03:31:24.199 align:start position:0%
well yeah you um I meant to mention that
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
in my testimony but uh forgot to get
 
03:31:30.389 --> 03:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
around to it um I I think this
 
03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
helps um remove kind of some of the
 
03:31:36.870 --> 03:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
uncertainity around posting to places
 
03:31:38.870 --> 03:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
like glass door you know as you
 
03:31:41.110 --> 03:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
mentioned they're Anonymous and the
 
03:31:44.469 --> 03:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
reason people post there anonymously is
 
03:31:47.349 --> 03:31:47.359 align:start position:0%
out of fear of Retribution for finding
 
03:31:50.510 --> 03:31:50.520 align:start position:0%
out that they might be violating a
 
03:31:53.750 --> 03:31:53.760 align:start position:0%
non-disparagement agreement and I think
 
03:31:57.710 --> 03:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
people should be able to do so openly
 
03:32:01.189 --> 03:32:01.199 align:start position:0%
with their own names attached to it um
 
03:32:03.550 --> 03:32:03.560 align:start position:0%
you know that to kind of and that that
 
03:32:06.269 --> 03:32:06.279 align:start position:0%
would help give their claims greater
 
03:32:09.710 --> 03:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
Credence If people could see oh um this
 
03:32:12.710 --> 03:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
is from someone who actually worked
 
03:32:18.150 --> 03:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
there um so yeah I I I think um yeah
 
03:32:20.309 --> 03:32:20.319 align:start position:0%
it's good that sites that glass store
 
03:32:24.309 --> 03:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
exist and um this bill should be helpful
 
03:32:24.319 --> 03:32:25.670 align:start position:0%
exist and um this bill should be helpful
for

03:32:25.670 --> 03:32:25.680 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:32:28.110 --> 03:32:28.120 align:start position:0%
them repr
 
03:32:30.389 --> 03:32:30.399 align:start position:0%
Sullivan thank
 
03:32:33.710 --> 03:32:33.720 align:start position:0%
you um having spent um quite a few years
 
03:32:36.349 --> 03:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
in labor relations um I was actually
 
03:32:38.710 --> 03:32:38.720 align:start position:0%
involved in quite a few Severance
 
03:32:42.110 --> 03:32:42.120 align:start position:0%
agreements um and these sever agreements
 
03:32:44.590 --> 03:32:44.600 align:start position:0%
first of all usually paid someone some
 
03:32:49.950 --> 03:32:49.960 align:start position:0%
money to go away um and um usually there
 
03:32:52.189 --> 03:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
03:32:57.429 --> 03:32:57.439 align:start position:0%
um an agreement for both parties not to
 
03:33:03.349 --> 03:33:03.359 align:start position:0%
um speak uh unkindly about the other um
 
03:33:06.510 --> 03:33:06.520 align:start position:0%
I and from my experience if that wasn't
 
03:33:08.790 --> 03:33:08.800 align:start position:0%
part of the agreement there would be no
 
03:33:10.990 --> 03:33:11.000 align:start position:0%
agreement there'd be no severance and
 
03:33:14.189 --> 03:33:14.199 align:start position:0%
anyone who wants to can simply quit uh
 
03:33:16.070 --> 03:33:16.080 align:start position:0%
go away and say anything they
 
03:33:18.990 --> 03:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
want um can you see how that could be a
 
03:33:21.590 --> 03:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
uh a detriment for someone who wants a
 
03:33:21.600 --> 03:33:24.750 align:start position:0%
uh a detriment for someone who wants a
severance

03:33:24.750 --> 03:33:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:24.760 --> 03:33:34.590 align:start position:0%
 
agreement

03:33:34.590 --> 03:33:34.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:38.110 --> 03:33:38.120 align:start position:0%
um I I mean I I
 
03:33:41.590 --> 03:33:41.600 align:start position:0%
think I I think yeah um if if somebody
 
03:33:43.710 --> 03:33:43.720 align:start position:0%
doesn't want to talk then they should
 
03:33:46.269 --> 03:33:46.279 align:start position:0%
have an option to take the agreement
 
03:33:48.830 --> 03:33:48.840 align:start position:0%
instead but I also do think that people
 
03:33:51.950 --> 03:33:51.960 align:start position:0%
who do want to talk should also have the
 
03:33:55.870 --> 03:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
option to talk and right now um many
 
03:33:59.429 --> 03:33:59.439 align:start position:0%
people don't seem to um think that they
 
03:34:04.309 --> 03:34:04.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:06.910 --> 03:34:06.920 align:start position:0%
that represent
 
03:34:08.830 --> 03:34:08.840 align:start position:0%
balani thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:34:10.309 --> 03:34:10.319 align:start position:0%
representative gallager so the flip side
 
03:34:12.510 --> 03:34:12.520 align:start position:0%
of this should the employer be able to
 
03:34:16.429 --> 03:34:16.439 align:start position:0%
disparage or an
 
03:34:16.439 --> 03:34:18.389 align:start position:0%
disparage or an
employee

03:34:18.389 --> 03:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
employee
 
03:34:23.510 --> 03:34:23.520 align:start position:0%
um I mean yeah I generally support I you
 
03:34:25.590 --> 03:34:25.600 align:start position:0%
know I generally support more speech
 
03:34:29.990 --> 03:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
rather than less um
 
03:34:34.950 --> 03:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
I um I mean I think there is kind of a
 
03:34:38.750 --> 03:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
power differential there um in terms of
 
03:34:41.830 --> 03:34:41.840 align:start position:0%
an employees life will be a lot more
 
03:34:46.710 --> 03:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
ruined if they're disparaged than um say
 
03:34:50.070 --> 03:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
an employers would um
 
03:34:56.910 --> 03:34:56.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:02.030 --> 03:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
um yeah I think um you know I I
 
03:35:07.110 --> 03:35:07.120 align:start position:0%
would want to maintain the uh status quo
 
03:35:11.550 --> 03:35:11.560 align:start position:0%
with um existing labor law um
 
03:35:15.389 --> 03:35:15.399 align:start position:0%
with what the uh Federal nlrb enforces
 
03:35:19.950 --> 03:35:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:23.269 --> 03:35:23.279 align:start position:0%
regards oh go ahead representative stop
 
03:35:24.790 --> 03:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
03:35:30.670 --> 03:35:30.680 align:start position:0%
question um can I um ask um in these
 
03:35:33.790 --> 03:35:33.800 align:start position:0%
situations um what kind of Leverage does
 
03:35:37.469 --> 03:35:37.479 align:start position:0%
the employer hold over the employee to
 
03:35:39.590 --> 03:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
make them sign these Severance
 
03:35:42.429 --> 03:35:42.439 align:start position:0%
agreements do they withhold wages is
 
03:35:47.110 --> 03:35:47.120 align:start position:0%
there um um is there some reason that
 
03:35:49.469 --> 03:35:49.479 align:start position:0%
people feel like they must sign these
 
03:35:51.710 --> 03:35:51.720 align:start position:0%
agreements when they separate from a
 
03:35:54.870 --> 03:35:54.880 align:start position:0%
company thank you
 
03:35:57.469 --> 03:35:57.479 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean this is kind of one of
 
03:35:59.870 --> 03:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
the things people wouldn't tell me
 
03:36:03.469 --> 03:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
because of um the Clauses in question so
 
03:36:05.550 --> 03:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
there's a little bit of a boot strap's
 
03:36:08.030 --> 03:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
Paradox there but I I do think it comes
 
03:36:16.269 --> 03:36:16.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:16.279 --> 03:36:19.990 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:36:19.990 --> 03:36:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:23.750 --> 03:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
uh yeah B Just the whole General um
 
03:36:26.030 --> 03:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
employer employee relationship in
 
03:36:27.950 --> 03:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
general where you know employers are
 
03:36:31.150 --> 03:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
referred to as the bosses and people
 
03:36:33.710 --> 03:36:33.720 align:start position:0%
assume that orders that bosses give are
 
03:36:37.309 --> 03:36:37.319 align:start position:0%
valid and um it's just kind of how
 
03:36:43.150 --> 03:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:44.750 --> 03:36:44.760 align:start position:0%
representative stab it would be illegal
 
03:36:47.870 --> 03:36:47.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire to withhold wages uh
 
03:36:50.830 --> 03:36:50.840 align:start position:0%
pending a a a uh you know you do the
 
03:36:52.469 --> 03:36:52.479 align:start position:0%
wages by the end of the week or within
 
03:36:54.630 --> 03:36:54.640 align:start position:0%
three business days or whatever a lot of
 
03:36:55.670 --> 03:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
the other things are usually for
 
03:36:57.790 --> 03:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
severances and and you know long-term
 
03:37:00.590 --> 03:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
parachutes and things like that uh rev
 
03:37:02.910 --> 03:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
Gallagher um one of the great things
 
03:37:05.110 --> 03:37:05.120 align:start position:0%
about the New Hampshire legislature is a
 
03:37:07.030 --> 03:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
representative like yourself can talk to
 
03:37:09.750 --> 03:37:09.760 align:start position:0%
someone down the street and find out
 
03:37:12.790 --> 03:37:12.800 align:start position:0%
about a problem and then submit a bill
 
03:37:14.870 --> 03:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
uh which you you've done here do you
 
03:37:18.269 --> 03:37:18.279 align:start position:0%
recall specifically at all what the
 
03:37:21.469 --> 03:37:21.479 align:start position:0%
circumstance was with that constituent
 
03:37:26.469 --> 03:37:26.479 align:start position:0%
you spoke with um it was
 
03:37:31.189 --> 03:37:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh well so it was someone uh who I was
 
03:37:35.429 --> 03:37:35.439 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how um there uh it
 
03:37:38.830 --> 03:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
was a teacher who was in negotiations
 
03:37:41.110 --> 03:37:41.120 align:start position:0%
with their school board
 
03:37:43.910 --> 03:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
um and I was trying to figure out more
 
03:37:45.990 --> 03:37:46.000 align:start position:0%
about how
 
03:37:51.150 --> 03:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
um how their negotiations went and um
 
03:37:53.309 --> 03:37:53.319 align:start position:0%
the reason they told me that they
 
03:37:58.110 --> 03:37:58.120 align:start position:0%
couldn't tell me more um about what
 
03:38:01.630 --> 03:38:01.640 align:start position:0%
happened was because um of a
 
03:38:04.229 --> 03:38:04.239 align:start position:0%
non-disparagement agreement that they'd
 
03:38:05.990 --> 03:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
signed when they
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%
left okay thank
 
03:38:13.750 --> 03:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:15.590 --> 03:38:15.600 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you

Bel next is David ju from the
 
03:38:31.830 --> 03:38:31.840 align:start position:0%

seat that's an inside joke is uh he
 
03:38:36.269 --> 03:38:36.279 align:start position:0%
wanted to know if he could bring as I as
 
03:38:38.070 --> 03:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
I'm walking here he wanted to know if he
 
03:38:39.389 --> 03:38:39.399 align:start position:0%

03:38:40.790 --> 03:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
security guard said well it's up to the
 
03:38:43.630 --> 03:38:43.640 align:start position:0%
chairman so we had to negotiate a little
 
03:38:46.710 --> 03:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
bit thank you Mr chair for completely
 
03:38:48.630 --> 03:38:48.640 align:start position:0%
throwing me under the
 
03:38:51.630 --> 03:38:51.640 align:start position:0%
bus um for the record my name is Dave
 
03:38:54.229 --> 03:38:54.239 align:start position:0%
juv I'm a senior vice president with the
 
03:38:56.189 --> 03:38:56.199 align:start position:0%
business and industry
 
03:38:58.110 --> 03:38:58.120 align:start position:0%
Association uh we serve as New
 
03:38:59.790 --> 03:38:59.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's Statewide Chamber of
 
03:39:02.670 --> 03:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
Commerce we have approximately 400
 
03:39:05.910 --> 03:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
employer members with over 100,000
 
03:39:09.550 --> 03:39:09.560 align:start position:0%
Granite State Employees I'm here uh in
 
03:39:12.710 --> 03:39:12.720 align:start position:0%
opposition to this bill um I thought
 
03:39:14.550 --> 03:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
several uh Representatives on the
 
03:39:16.950 --> 03:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
committee uh have already asked some
 
03:39:21.150 --> 03:39:21.160 align:start position:0%
pretty good questions um I do want to
 
03:39:23.830 --> 03:39:23.840 align:start position:0%
let the committee know that issues like
 
03:39:27.670 --> 03:39:27.680 align:start position:0%
this are um already a part of federal
 
03:39:31.229 --> 03:39:31.239 align:start position:0%
labor relations acts that stipulate uh
 
03:39:33.910 --> 03:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
what can and cannot be a part of a um
 
03:39:33.920 --> 03:39:35.590 align:start position:0%
what can and cannot be a part of a um
Severance

03:39:35.590 --> 03:39:35.600 align:start position:0%
Severance
 
03:39:39.710 --> 03:39:39.720 align:start position:0%
agreement uh so in in one sense I think
 
03:39:42.550 --> 03:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
this would be preempted by federal law
 
03:39:45.070 --> 03:39:45.080 align:start position:0%
this bill does go beyond what the
 
03:39:49.950 --> 03:39:49.960 align:start position:0%
federal law is so um I'm not sure that's
 
03:39:51.429 --> 03:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
a good
 
03:39:56.870 --> 03:39:56.880 align:start position:0%
thing um the reality is that that um
 
03:39:59.229 --> 03:39:59.239 align:start position:0%
when you're considering legislation I
 
03:40:01.150 --> 03:40:01.160 align:start position:0%
would hope one of the first things you
 
03:40:03.269 --> 03:40:03.279 align:start position:0%
ask is is there a problem here that
 
03:40:06.990 --> 03:40:07.000 align:start position:0%
needs to be corrected and I am certain
 
03:40:09.790 --> 03:40:09.800 align:start position:0%
that there may be uh one or several
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
individ uals who may have felt grieved
 
03:40:15.550 --> 03:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
about the parameters of the severance
 
03:40:17.870 --> 03:40:17.880 align:start position:0%
agreement that they agreed to that they
 
03:40:21.110 --> 03:40:21.120 align:start position:0%
signed and agreed to um represent
 
03:40:23.349 --> 03:40:23.359 align:start position:0%
Sullivan was absolutely correct in the
 
03:40:25.110 --> 03:40:25.120 align:start position:0%
event of a severance agreement which by
 
03:40:27.910 --> 03:40:27.920 align:start position:0%
the way is not generally initiated by
 
03:40:30.510 --> 03:40:30.520 align:start position:0%
the employee it's generally initiated by
 
03:40:33.469 --> 03:40:33.479 align:start position:0%
the employer because there's a situation
 
03:40:37.309 --> 03:40:37.319 align:start position:0%
that needs to be remedied and uh it
 
03:40:39.510 --> 03:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
needs to be remedied in such a way that
 
03:40:40.990 --> 03:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
it there's not
 
03:40:43.950 --> 03:40:43.960 align:start position:0%
not publicly firing the individual
 
03:40:45.750 --> 03:40:45.760 align:start position:0%
there's a thousand different reasons why
 
03:40:48.349 --> 03:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
Severance agreements happen but one
 
03:40:50.510 --> 03:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
thing they all have in common is that
 
03:40:54.510 --> 03:40:54.520 align:start position:0%
it's a negotiation between the employee
 
03:40:57.790 --> 03:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
and the employer uh the employer
 
03:41:02.189 --> 03:41:02.199 align:start position:0%
generally um will make it worth the
 
03:41:06.110 --> 03:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
individuals um consideration to agree to
 
03:41:08.189 --> 03:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
the agreement but there's no obligation
 
03:41:12.150 --> 03:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
for that individual to agree to to it so
 
03:41:15.710 --> 03:41:15.720 align:start position:0%
I find this uh Bill unnecessary I think
 
03:41:19.030 --> 03:41:19.040 align:start position:0%
it could lead to a Pandora's box of all
 
03:41:22.630 --> 03:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
kinds of um unintended consequences and
 
03:41:25.229 --> 03:41:25.239 align:start position:0%
I would ask the committee to uh itl it
 
03:41:27.189 --> 03:41:27.199 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions Mr
 
03:41:29.590 --> 03:41:29.600 align:start position:0%
chair and so far I have not spilled the
 
03:41:33.030 --> 03:41:33.040 align:start position:0%
water just as long as we know that we'll
 
03:41:34.790 --> 03:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
to take some questions are there any
 
03:41:37.110 --> 03:41:37.120 align:start position:0%

here today um for the New Hampshire
 
03:42:59.349 --> 03:42:59.359 align:start position:0%
Association of counties and the
 
03:43:01.870 --> 03:43:01.880 align:start position:0%
association is opposed to the uh to
 
03:43:04.469 --> 03:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1375 it really follows Mr
 
03:43:07.389 --> 03:43:07.399 align:start position:0%
jv's testimony um as I said they're
 
03:43:09.590 --> 03:43:09.600 align:start position:0%
oppos Association of counties is opposed
 
03:43:11.990 --> 03:43:12.000 align:start position:0%
on the rounds that uh the bill prohibits
 
03:43:13.469 --> 03:43:13.479 align:start position:0%
employees from entering a severance
 
03:43:15.510 --> 03:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
agreement but there's currently nothing
 
03:43:18.110 --> 03:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
that compels employees to enter these
 
03:43:20.349 --> 03:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
agreements um and employees and
 
03:43:22.750 --> 03:43:22.760 align:start position:0%
employers uh should have the ability to
 
03:43:25.149 --> 03:43:25.159 align:start position:0%
freely enter any agreement um that they
 
03:43:27.149 --> 03:43:27.159 align:start position:0%
choose and this bill restricts the uh
 
03:43:30.990 --> 03:43:31.000 align:start position:0%
their ability to do that um that's all I
 
03:43:33.550 --> 03:43:33.560 align:start position:0%
got uh thank you for your time and I'm
 
03:43:35.149 --> 03:43:35.159 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions but I'm going to
 
03:43:38.269 --> 03:43:38.279 align:start position:0%
I'm going to take them back to um the
 
03:43:42.830 --> 03:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:42.840 --> 03:43:45.469 align:start position:0%

right representative seaworth thank you
 
03:43:50.950 --> 03:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm wondering and if you if
 
03:43:54.189 --> 03:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
you know the background where um this
 
03:43:55.990 --> 03:43:56.000 align:start position:0%
kind of agreement
 
03:43:58.429 --> 03:43:58.439 align:start position:0%
might take place in the county
 
03:44:00.670 --> 03:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
environment it does it tend to be
 
03:44:03.550 --> 03:44:03.560 align:start position:0%
associated with labor agreements
 
03:44:05.469 --> 03:44:05.479 align:start position:0%
or uh I'm going to have to take that
 
03:44:07.309 --> 03:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
back to the county county administrators
 
03:44:09.349 --> 03:44:09.359 align:start position:0%
but happy to have them follow up with
 
03:44:14.469 --> 03:44:14.479 align:start position:0%

anyone else who would like to speak on
 
03:44:25.269 --> 03:44:25.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.030 --> 03:44:28.040 align:start position:0%
1375 all right the hearing is now closed
 
03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
on 1375 we will reconvene at 2 o' for

03:44:38.760 --> 03:44:44.429 align:start position:0%

03:44:47.710 --> 03:44:47.720 align:start position:0%
hey uh Tim you know you know where uh M
 
03:44:50.590 --> 03:44:50.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:52.630 --> 03:44:52.640 align:start position:0%
to trying to work on what we're going to
 
03:44:59.990 --> 03:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:03.189 --> 03:45:03.199 align:start position:0%
um well subcommittee is not no the
 
03:45:04.189 --> 03:45:04.199 align:start position:0%
subcommittee is not going to give us
 
03:45:06.149 --> 03:45:06.159 align:start position:0%
enough time because we have to have it
 
03:45:07.830 --> 03:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
out in two weeks but I seriously think
 
03:45:10.550 --> 03:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
we need to do some things and and I I
 
03:45:10.560 --> 03:45:38.670 align:start position:0%
we need to do some things and and I I
know

03:45:38.670 --> 03:45:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:38.680 --> 04:14:08.590 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:14:08.590 --> 04:14:08.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:11.189 --> 04:14:11.199 align:start position:0%
quiet so I assume we must uh be at 2
 
04:14:13.790 --> 04:14:13.800 align:start position:0%
o'cl by now uh the chairman had to go
 
04:14:17.830 --> 04:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
and testify before another committee um
 
04:14:20.910 --> 04:14:20.920 align:start position:0%
so I would let like to get started
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
opening um the hearing on House Bill
 
04:14:27.389 --> 04:14:27.399 align:start position:0%
1519 and I would like to recognize the
 
04:14:34.910 --> 04:14:34.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:39.309 --> 04:14:39.319 align:start position:0%
leus thank you ala alus Hillsboro
 
04:14:39.319 --> 04:14:40.870 align:start position:0%
leus thank you ala alus Hillsboro
38

04:14:40.870 --> 04:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
38
 
04:14:45.510 --> 04:14:45.520 align:start position:0%
um I am not positive that the words of
 
04:14:50.349 --> 04:14:50.359 align:start position:0%
this bill accurately describe the intent
 
04:14:54.030 --> 04:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
of this bill three conversations with
 
04:14:56.750 --> 04:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
the drafting attorney and a redraft
 
04:14:59.830 --> 04:14:59.840 align:start position:0%
which came out the very last day I'm not
 
04:15:02.790 --> 04:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
sure it's right but um I don't know
 
04:15:05.670 --> 04:15:05.680 align:start position:0%
labor I know education so I figured if I
 
04:15:08.070 --> 04:15:08.080 align:start position:0%
presented to you the intent of the bill
 
04:15:09.950 --> 04:15:09.960 align:start position:0%
and it needed to be changed I am willing
 
04:15:11.910 --> 04:15:11.920 align:start position:0%
to do whatever to change it I know it's
 
04:15:13.950 --> 04:15:13.960 align:start position:0%
your bill but I'm willing to do the leg
 
04:15:18.630 --> 04:15:18.640 align:start position:0%
work um and get it fixed so my
 
04:15:22.830 --> 04:15:22.840 align:start position:0%
intent was based on conversation I had
 
04:15:25.469 --> 04:15:25.479 align:start position:0%
with numerous students and parents who
 
04:15:29.189 --> 04:15:29.199 align:start position:0%
were frustrated because the either the
 
04:15:32.750 --> 04:15:32.760 align:start position:0%
kids or well because the kids wanted to
 
04:15:37.349 --> 04:15:37.359 align:start position:0%
work during what was normally School
 
04:15:41.550 --> 04:15:41.560 align:start position:0%
hours now some of those kids are seniors
 
04:15:43.750 --> 04:15:43.760 align:start position:0%
they only are going partial days and
 
04:15:46.109 --> 04:15:46.119 align:start position:0%
they want to work the rest of that time
 
04:15:48.510 --> 04:15:48.520 align:start position:0%
some of them are homeschool kids who
 
04:15:50.870 --> 04:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
work on a who do their homeschool on a
 
04:15:53.189 --> 04:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
different time frame they may do
 
04:15:54.750 --> 04:15:54.760 align:start position:0%
afternoons and evenings instead of
 
04:15:57.389 --> 04:15:57.399 align:start position:0%
mornings and afternoons and they wanted
 
04:16:00.550 --> 04:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
to be able to go to work during those
 
04:16:04.710 --> 04:16:04.720 align:start position:0%
what would be normally school hours and
 
04:16:07.189 --> 04:16:07.199 align:start position:0%
they were told by their employers that
 
04:16:10.550 --> 04:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
they can't do that because of treny
 
04:16:14.229 --> 04:16:14.239 align:start position:0%
rules and various other things that they
 
04:16:16.109 --> 04:16:16.119 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to work during the
 
04:16:20.710 --> 04:16:20.720 align:start position:0%
hours the normal school hours and so I
 
04:16:24.710 --> 04:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
didn't actually find any rules or laws
 
04:16:26.349 --> 04:16:26.359 align:start position:0%
that said that they couldn't but
 
04:16:29.269 --> 04:16:29.279 align:start position:0%
apparently employers think they can't
 
04:16:32.189 --> 04:16:32.199 align:start position:0%
and so I thought that my intent was just
 
04:16:35.950 --> 04:16:35.960 align:start position:0%
really to make it very clear that yes if
 
04:16:39.149 --> 04:16:39.159 align:start position:0%
a child does not have to be in school
 
04:16:43.149 --> 04:16:43.159 align:start position:0%
during particular hours yes they can
 
04:16:45.790 --> 04:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
work during those hours so that my
 
04:16:47.870 --> 04:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
intent was very simple I do not intend
 
04:16:50.710 --> 04:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
to change any other labor laws or
 
04:16:53.149 --> 04:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
anything else I just wanted a very clear
 
04:16:55.469 --> 04:16:55.479 align:start position:0%
statement so that employers would know
 
04:16:57.670 --> 04:16:57.680 align:start position:0%
yes they could hire these
 
04:17:00.109 --> 04:17:00.119 align:start position:0%
children thank you for that testimony I
 
04:17:04.109 --> 04:17:04.119 align:start position:0%
do I don't want to get too into the
 
04:17:06.070 --> 04:17:06.080 align:start position:0%
technical details of it because of what
 
04:17:08.469 --> 04:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
you said but I have a couple of maybe
 
04:17:12.990 --> 04:17:13.000 align:start position:0%
broader ones um first in the first
 
04:17:16.750 --> 04:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
section uh paragraph 4 did any of your
 
04:17:19.349 --> 04:17:19.359 align:start position:0%
discussion come up with what New
 
04:17:22.550 --> 04:17:22.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire does in terms of the 16 and
 
04:17:25.109 --> 04:17:25.119 align:start position:0%
under youth is mirror federal
 
04:17:27.469 --> 04:17:27.479 align:start position:0%
law um
 
04:17:30.710 --> 04:17:30.720 align:start position:0%
so by removing Federal Provisions from
 
04:17:33.550 --> 04:17:33.560 align:start position:0%
the state law doesn't make something
 
04:17:36.590 --> 04:17:36.600 align:start position:0%
legal did did you look into no because I
 
04:17:39.670 --> 04:17:39.680 align:start position:0%
had said I don't want to change any law
 
04:17:43.189 --> 04:17:43.199 align:start position:0%
I just want to make the law
 
04:17:46.189 --> 04:17:46.199 align:start position:0%
clear I didn't want to actually change
 
04:17:50.830 --> 04:17:50.840 align:start position:0%
working hours and whatever unless you
 
04:17:53.510 --> 04:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
can tell me that in fact it is illegal
 
04:17:56.790 --> 04:17:56.800 align:start position:0%
for kids to work during school hours I
 
04:17:58.710 --> 04:17:58.720 align:start position:0%
was not able to find
 
04:18:01.670 --> 04:18:01.680 align:start position:0%
that and I guess the other question I
 
04:18:04.790 --> 04:18:04.800 align:start position:0%
would have along those same lines is it
 
04:18:08.349 --> 04:18:08.359 align:start position:0%
sounded and this is one I know labor law
 
04:18:12.070 --> 04:18:12.080 align:start position:0%
but I don't know the truancy laws
 
04:18:17.189 --> 04:18:17.199 align:start position:0%
and if as you hinted at the issue is
 
04:18:19.670 --> 04:18:19.680 align:start position:0%
within the treny section of the law did
 
04:18:22.830 --> 04:18:22.840 align:start position:0%
you look at that as the place that would
 
04:18:26.229 --> 04:18:26.239 align:start position:0%
education and those laws I do know and
 
04:18:29.030 --> 04:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
they are just required to be in school
 
04:18:31.910 --> 04:18:31.920 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't have any hours especially
 
04:18:35.750 --> 04:18:35.760 align:start position:0%
not for homeschool kids there are no
 
04:18:38.189 --> 04:18:38.199 align:start position:0%
particular hours that they have to be
 
04:18:38.199 --> 04:18:40.149 align:start position:0%
particular hours that they have to be
there

04:18:40.149 --> 04:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:18:43.309 --> 04:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
so yes it doesn't actually violate true
 
04:18:45.389 --> 04:18:45.399 align:start position:0%
and say as long as the child is not
 
04:18:48.670 --> 04:18:48.680 align:start position:0%
supposed is not actually supposed to be
 
04:18:52.830 --> 04:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:56.670 --> 04:18:56.680 align:start position:0%
hours all right thank you and I I agree
 
04:18:58.870 --> 04:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
with your statement that I think this
 
04:18:58.880 --> 04:19:00.510 align:start position:0%
with your statement that I think this
language

04:19:00.510 --> 04:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
language
 
04:19:04.670 --> 04:19:04.680 align:start position:0%
is a long way from the intent and
 
04:19:07.670 --> 04:19:07.680 align:start position:0%
I I don't know how to how to connect
 
04:19:11.429 --> 04:19:11.439 align:start position:0%
those dots but I mean on that we agree
 
04:19:13.630 --> 04:19:13.640 align:start position:0%
yes well I'm willing to start over this
 
04:19:17.710 --> 04:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
was I and I communicated multiple times
 
04:19:20.070 --> 04:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
this is all I want and this is what I
 
04:19:24.030 --> 04:19:24.040 align:start position:0%
got and I don't think it's right so with
 
04:19:25.590 --> 04:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
that are there other members of the
 
04:19:27.469 --> 04:19:27.479 align:start position:0%
committee with questions representative
 
04:19:29.870 --> 04:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
stop yeah thank you for taking my
 
04:19:32.750 --> 04:19:32.760 align:start position:0%
question on lines four and five um it
 
04:19:36.349 --> 04:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
strikes the language that says that uh
 
04:19:40.189 --> 04:19:40.199 align:start position:0%
youth under the age of 16 years um it it
 
04:19:42.149 --> 04:19:42.159 align:start position:0%
says that they should not be allowed to
 
04:19:44.389 --> 04:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
work more than 3 hours per day on school
 
04:19:47.469 --> 04:19:47.479 align:start position:0%
days in 23 hours per week on school
 
04:19:50.149 --> 04:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
weeks and that that language has been
 
04:19:52.189 --> 04:19:52.199 align:start position:0%
struck is was that your intent that was
 
04:19:54.349 --> 04:19:54.359 align:start position:0%
not my intent I do not know why it was
 
04:19:56.750 --> 04:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
struck because I was very specific I
 
04:19:59.550 --> 04:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
don't want to change any laws okay all
 
04:20:01.590 --> 04:20:01.600 align:start position:0%
right thank
 
04:20:03.870 --> 04:20:03.880 align:start position:0%
you further questions representative
 
04:20:06.630 --> 04:20:06.640 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
representative lers I I think as far as
 
04:20:13.189 --> 04:20:13.199 align:start position:0%
the The Homeschool issue I understand
 
04:20:15.590 --> 04:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
they may have a different schedule but
 
04:20:17.590 --> 04:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
most employers are more comfortable
 
04:20:20.149 --> 04:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
working with the calendar and schedule
 
04:20:22.750 --> 04:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
of the local school district and that
 
04:20:24.149 --> 04:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
way they I could understand where they
 
04:20:26.269 --> 04:20:26.279 align:start position:0%
feel apprehensive about someone
 
04:20:29.269 --> 04:20:29.279 align:start position:0%
saying I my hours are
 
04:20:32.790 --> 04:20:32.800 align:start position:0%
different uh I I'm not sure would you
 
04:20:34.830 --> 04:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
believe that that I think this might be
 
04:20:37.229 --> 04:20:37.239 align:start position:0%
unworkable uh for the employ lawyers
 
04:20:39.590 --> 04:20:39.600 align:start position:0%
well I was considering I mean what I
 
04:20:43.030 --> 04:20:43.040 align:start position:0%
would have liked in here was something
 
04:20:45.990 --> 04:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
verification so that a child could
 
04:20:47.710 --> 04:20:47.720 align:start position:0%
either bring a note from their school
 
04:20:49.469 --> 04:20:49.479 align:start position:0%
saying no I'm not required to be in
 
04:20:51.990 --> 04:20:52.000 align:start position:0%
school during these hours like for a
 
04:20:54.750 --> 04:20:54.760 align:start position:0%
senior who's working partial day I mean
 
04:20:58.109 --> 04:20:58.119 align:start position:0%
attending partial day or from the parent
 
04:21:01.070 --> 04:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
The Homeschool parent saying no we do
 
04:21:03.429 --> 04:21:03.439 align:start position:0%
our home school these hours not those
 
04:21:06.550 --> 04:21:06.560 align:start position:0%
hours and so I would be very happy to
 
04:21:09.389 --> 04:21:09.399 align:start position:0%
see that in here as a verification so
 
04:21:11.469 --> 04:21:11.479 align:start position:0%
employers wouldn't be put in that
 
04:21:11.479 --> 04:21:13.189 align:start position:0%
employers wouldn't be put in that
position

04:21:13.189 --> 04:21:13.199 align:start position:0%
position
 
04:21:15.429 --> 04:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
follow yeah actually it was it was a
 
04:21:17.030 --> 04:21:17.040 align:start position:0%
very long time ago but I during my
 
04:21:19.670 --> 04:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
senior year I also worked uh I only had
 
04:21:21.349 --> 04:21:21.359 align:start position:0%
morning classes so I worked in the
 
04:21:24.950 --> 04:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
afternoon and uh and I don't remember
 
04:21:26.710 --> 04:21:26.720 align:start position:0%
any questions or verification but this
 
04:21:29.510 --> 04:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
was another state so but perhaps that
 
04:21:34.790 --> 04:21:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:39.790 --> 04:21:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:42.149 --> 04:21:42.159 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for your
 
04:21:46.109 --> 04:21:46.119 align:start position:0%
testimony I do not see any other pink
 
04:21:48.990 --> 04:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
cards on this bill um so if there was
 
04:21:53.030 --> 04:21:53.040 align:start position:0%
anybody in the in the audience today did
 
04:21:55.229 --> 04:21:55.239 align:start position:0%

04:21:58.990 --> 04:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
anyone else um wants to speak please
 
04:22:02.189 --> 04:22:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:06.910 --> 04:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh do you wish to ask if we if
 
04:22:09.630 --> 04:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
we could have the department come up y
 
04:22:09.640 --> 04:22:31.870 align:start position:0%
we could have the department come up y
thank

04:22:31.870 --> 04:22:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:35.109 --> 04:22:35.119 align:start position:0%
you good afternoon Mr chairman and
 
04:22:36.910 --> 04:22:36.920 align:start position:0%
committee thank you my name is Tracy
 
04:22:39.550 --> 04:22:39.560 align:start position:0%
McGraw I'm an attorney and legislative
 
04:22:41.389 --> 04:22:41.399 align:start position:0%
leam for the New Hampshire Department of
 
04:22:43.229 --> 04:22:43.239 align:start position:0%
Labor and I'm here to answer any
 
04:22:46.469 --> 04:22:46.479 align:start position:0%
questions you need representative line
 
04:22:47.950 --> 04:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
Thank you Mr chairman thank you again
 
04:22:51.590 --> 04:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
miss McGrath for being here um uh
 
04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
hearing the comments of the uh
 
04:22:55.550 --> 04:22:55.560 align:start position:0%
representative that brought this forward
 
04:22:57.630 --> 04:22:57.640 align:start position:0%
um bringing a note to the
 
04:23:00.630 --> 04:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
employer um would the would the
 
04:23:03.630 --> 04:23:03.640 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor view that as okay
 
04:23:05.630 --> 04:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
well he hasn't know he's okay to be here
 
04:23:08.189 --> 04:23:08.199 align:start position:0%
or would the employer be in violation of
 
04:23:11.189 --> 04:23:11.199 align:start position:0%
labor law under not the changes but the
 
04:23:11.199 --> 04:23:12.630 align:start position:0%
labor law under not the changes but the
current

04:23:12.630 --> 04:23:12.640 align:start position:0%
current
 
04:23:12.640 --> 04:23:14.229 align:start position:0%
current
law

04:23:14.229 --> 04:23:14.239 align:start position:0%
law
 
04:23:17.149 --> 04:23:17.159 align:start position:0%
so basically what you would need is
 
04:23:20.269 --> 04:23:20.279 align:start position:0%
either one an authorization from the
 
04:23:22.910 --> 04:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
parent and you would need a document
 
04:23:25.670 --> 04:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
that came from the school a a formalized
 
04:23:27.510 --> 04:23:27.520 align:start position:0%
document that gave you whatever the
 
04:23:30.990 --> 04:23:31.000 align:start position:0%
specific schedule was but the issue that
 
04:23:33.389 --> 04:23:33.399 align:start position:0%
comes into play is how difficult is it
 
04:23:35.030 --> 04:23:35.040 align:start position:0%
going to be for an employer to have to
 
04:23:37.670 --> 04:23:37.680 align:start position:0%
keep track of how many employees they
 
04:23:41.189 --> 04:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
have what their various schedules are to
 
04:23:44.389 --> 04:23:44.399 align:start position:0%
keep track of one schedule and we have a
 
04:23:46.109 --> 04:23:46.119 align:start position:0%
lot of communities where people will
 
04:23:48.070 --> 04:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
travel a little distance to go to work
 
04:23:50.950 --> 04:23:50.960 align:start position:0%
and I use you know a supermarket chain
 
04:23:52.910 --> 04:23:52.920 align:start position:0%
let's say where kids are coming from
 
04:23:54.550 --> 04:23:54.560 align:start position:0%
different school
 
04:23:57.510 --> 04:23:57.520 align:start position:0%
districts one thing to have a School
 
04:24:01.269 --> 04:24:01.279 align:start position:0%
District calendar in your personel file
 
04:24:03.030 --> 04:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
and for that employer to know exactly
 
04:24:06.189 --> 04:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
what the calendar is versus having not
 
04:24:07.830 --> 04:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
not only the school district calendar
 
04:24:09.910 --> 04:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
that shows you what the school district
 
04:24:12.710 --> 04:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
requires but also then having a separate
 
04:24:15.630 --> 04:24:15.640 align:start position:0%
document from that school stating that
 
04:24:19.349 --> 04:24:19.359 align:start position:0%
um this particular student is able or is
 
04:24:21.429 --> 04:24:21.439 align:start position:0%
is not at work or excuse me is not at
 
04:24:23.389 --> 04:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
school during this particular time and
 
04:24:25.990 --> 04:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
then have to keep track of that it opens
 
04:24:27.670 --> 04:24:27.680 align:start position:0%
the door the concern that the department
 
04:24:29.030 --> 04:24:29.040 align:start position:0%
has is it opens the door for the
 
04:24:31.910 --> 04:24:31.920 align:start position:0%
employer to violate
 
04:24:35.189 --> 04:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
unwittingly and it would be a very
 
04:24:36.469 --> 04:24:36.479 align:start position:0%
difficult position to put put the
 
04:24:40.030 --> 04:24:40.040 align:start position:0%
employer in um but as far as an actual
 
04:24:42.429 --> 04:24:42.439 align:start position:0%
note from a student I don't know that
 
04:24:44.590 --> 04:24:44.600 align:start position:0%
the department would actually accept
 
04:24:47.950 --> 04:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
that as verification of what the student
 
04:24:51.510 --> 04:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
is actually required to attend in school
 
04:24:53.750 --> 04:24:53.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr I'd kind of like
 
04:24:56.750 --> 04:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
to follow up in a clarification it so
 
04:25:00.109 --> 04:25:00.119 align:start position:0%
let's and I I understand your point that
 
04:25:00.119 --> 04:25:01.309 align:start position:0%
let's and I I understand your point that
most

04:25:01.309 --> 04:25:01.319 align:start position:0%
most
 
04:25:03.790 --> 04:25:03.800 align:start position:0%
employers whatever the law is probably
 
04:25:06.269 --> 04:25:06.279 align:start position:0%
say you know what that is so complicated
 
04:25:08.870 --> 04:25:08.880 align:start position:0%
don't know whether I'm going to be legal
 
04:25:11.429 --> 04:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
or not so I'm just going to this is the
 
04:25:14.349 --> 04:25:14.359 align:start position:0%
simple rule but supposing that a
 
04:25:17.070 --> 04:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
employer did go through and collecting
 
04:25:19.590 --> 04:25:19.600 align:start position:0%
they have kids from multiple school
 
04:25:21.349 --> 04:25:21.359 align:start position:0%
districts so each one they have a
 
04:25:24.910 --> 04:25:24.920 align:start position:0%
calendar each one they have um a note
 
04:25:26.910 --> 04:25:26.920 align:start position:0%
from the school itself with class
 
04:25:29.149 --> 04:25:29.159 align:start position:0%
schedules and they're really keeping
 
04:25:32.269 --> 04:25:32.279 align:start position:0%
track of that is there anything that
 
04:25:34.990 --> 04:25:35.000 align:start position:0%
stops them in current law from doing
 
04:25:37.830 --> 04:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
that way or would the department come
 
04:25:41.269 --> 04:25:41.279 align:start position:0%
down on them simply
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
because it's it's
 
04:25:46.990 --> 04:25:47.000 align:start position:0%
complex well the department can handle
 
04:25:49.070 --> 04:25:49.080 align:start position:0%
complex and the department knows that
 
04:25:51.710 --> 04:25:51.720 align:start position:0%
employers can handle complex the
 
04:25:53.590 --> 04:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
employer has a right to decide whether
 
04:25:55.910 --> 04:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
they want to handle
 
04:25:59.189 --> 04:25:59.199 align:start position:0%
complex uh If an employer an employee
 
04:26:01.030 --> 04:26:01.040 align:start position:0%
came in I'm not even sure who would
 
04:26:04.030 --> 04:26:04.040 align:start position:0%
actually be the complainant in this
 
04:26:06.630 --> 04:26:06.640 align:start position:0%
particular situation might be the parent
 
04:26:08.670 --> 04:26:08.680 align:start position:0%
um but if the employer or the
 
04:26:11.590 --> 04:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
employee is before the a hearing officer
 
04:26:13.109 --> 04:26:13.119 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Labor over a
 
04:26:14.510 --> 04:26:14.520 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not they should
 
04:26:14.520 --> 04:26:15.990 align:start position:0%
question of whether or not they should
have

04:26:15.990 --> 04:26:16.000 align:start position:0%
have
 
04:26:19.189 --> 04:26:19.199 align:start position:0%
worked if you've got that document from
 
04:26:20.990 --> 04:26:21.000 align:start position:0%
the school not a handwritten document
 
04:26:23.229 --> 04:26:23.239 align:start position:0%
from Mom Dad or the student if you've
 
04:26:25.030 --> 04:26:25.040 align:start position:0%
got the document from the school and the
 
04:26:27.710 --> 04:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
employer is willing to take the extra
 
04:26:30.030 --> 04:26:30.040 align:start position:0%
time and care to make sure that that
 
04:26:33.149 --> 04:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
student is not working during times that
 
04:26:34.950 --> 04:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
he is actually required by his own
 
04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
personal schedule to work work then as
 
04:26:41.630 --> 04:26:41.640 align:start position:0%
long as it followed current law which I
 
04:26:43.550 --> 04:26:43.560 align:start position:0%
know that we're in the process of of
 
04:26:46.550 --> 04:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
adjusting hopefully or I I know that
 
04:26:48.630 --> 04:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
there's some bills out there as long as
 
04:26:49.990 --> 04:26:50.000 align:start position:0%
it's within current law they're not
 
04:26:51.750 --> 04:26:51.760 align:start position:0%
working past what they're supposed to be
 
04:26:55.109 --> 04:26:55.119 align:start position:0%
working if it changed to that then we
 
04:26:58.590 --> 04:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:00.389 --> 04:27:00.399 align:start position:0%
administer and I guess there's a
 
04:27:02.630 --> 04:27:02.640 align:start position:0%
followup it seems to me from what you
 
04:27:04.630 --> 04:27:04.640 align:start position:0%
said is it wouldn't need to change to
 
04:27:06.910 --> 04:27:06.920 align:start position:0%
that because
 
04:27:10.309 --> 04:27:10.319 align:start position:0%
there's there's nothing stopping someone
 
04:27:13.550 --> 04:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
from properly
 
04:27:16.309 --> 04:27:16.319 align:start position:0%
documenting the schedule and validating
 
04:27:19.109 --> 04:27:19.119 align:start position:0%
that a 17-year-old is in fact not
 
04:27:21.950 --> 04:27:21.960 align:start position:0%
required to be anywhere
 
04:27:24.550 --> 04:27:24.560 align:start position:0%
else it doesn't seem like we need to
 
04:27:27.229 --> 04:27:27.239 align:start position:0%
make a law that authorizes
 
04:27:29.830 --> 04:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
that I think what I'd like to do before
 
04:27:31.990 --> 04:27:32.000 align:start position:0%
I give you a final answer on that is
 
04:27:33.870 --> 04:27:33.880 align:start position:0%
take a look at the law a little bit more
 
04:27:35.710 --> 04:27:35.720 align:start position:0%
closely back at my office and I would be
 
04:27:38.830 --> 04:27:38.840 align:start position:0%
more more than happy to respond to the
 
04:27:40.429 --> 04:27:40.439 align:start position:0%
entire committee on that because I want
 
04:27:41.910 --> 04:27:41.920 align:start position:0%
to make sure that I give you accurate
 
04:27:44.229 --> 04:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
information and compare it to what this
 
04:27:46.790 --> 04:27:46.800 align:start position:0%
bill is trying to do and see whether or
 
04:27:48.309 --> 04:27:48.319 align:start position:0%
not there would be an issue of a
 
04:27:50.790 --> 04:27:50.800 align:start position:0%
violation I I would appreciate that
 
04:27:53.149 --> 04:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
because I don't know either thank you uh
 
04:27:55.950 --> 04:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
let's go with representative Granger uh
 
04:27:55.960 --> 04:27:56.910 align:start position:0%
let's go with representative Granger uh
thank

04:27:56.910 --> 04:27:56.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
04:27:59.630 --> 04:27:59.640 align:start position:0%
you is it so this this is an important
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
question in regards to the homeschoolers
 
04:28:02.910 --> 04:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
is there anything that currently
 
04:28:04.550 --> 04:28:04.560 align:start position:0%
prevents a homeschooler from working
 
04:28:06.790 --> 04:28:06.800 align:start position:0%
during school hours if they're obviously
 
04:28:08.670 --> 04:28:08.680 align:start position:0%
a homeschooler and they can set their
 
04:28:09.950 --> 04:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
them and their parents negotiate their
 
04:28:11.469 --> 04:28:11.479 align:start position:0%
own schooling
 
04:28:14.149 --> 04:28:14.159 align:start position:0%
hours homeschoolers and and The
 
04:28:17.070 --> 04:28:17.080 align:start position:0%
Homeschool program is associated with
 
04:28:19.429 --> 04:28:19.439 align:start position:0%
whatever particular School District that
 
04:28:21.990 --> 04:28:22.000 align:start position:0%
they're with and they have to follow the
 
04:28:25.269 --> 04:28:25.279 align:start position:0%
district schedule as far as specifics as
 
04:28:27.790 --> 04:28:27.800 align:start position:0%
to classes if the district schedule
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
allows for this kind of um free change
 
04:28:35.510 --> 04:28:35.520 align:start position:0%
of classes or being out during certain
 
04:28:37.870 --> 04:28:37.880 align:start position:0%
periods periods the way I had no idea
 
04:28:37.880 --> 04:28:38.870 align:start position:0%
periods periods the way I had no idea
even

04:28:38.870 --> 04:28:38.880 align:start position:0%
even
 
04:28:41.990 --> 04:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
existed um but if if they're able to
 
04:28:43.550 --> 04:28:43.560 align:start position:0%
take the afternoon off from school and
 
04:28:44.870 --> 04:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
still get all of their required
 
04:28:46.670 --> 04:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
classwork in and that is something that
 
04:28:49.510 --> 04:28:49.520 align:start position:0%
the school accepts or would accept then
 
04:28:51.670 --> 04:28:51.680 align:start position:0%
that should fit within the same category
 
04:28:54.269 --> 04:28:54.279 align:start position:0%
so if you're looking at somebody who is
 
04:28:56.550 --> 04:28:56.560 align:start position:0%
not scheduled to work in the morning or
 
04:28:57.870 --> 04:28:57.880 align:start position:0%
excuse me not scheduled to go to school
 
04:28:58.950 --> 04:28:58.960 align:start position:0%
in the morning because they're doing
 
04:29:01.070 --> 04:29:01.080 align:start position:0%
homeschool in the afternoon it really
 
04:29:02.389 --> 04:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
has to depend on what the school
 
04:29:03.950 --> 04:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
district allows as well because they
 
04:29:07.950 --> 04:29:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:11.429 --> 04:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
so my understanding of the intent of the
 
04:29:12.990 --> 04:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
Prime sponsor if I understood her
 
04:29:15.229 --> 04:29:15.239 align:start position:0%
correctly is to allow homeschoolers to
 
04:29:18.429 --> 04:29:18.439 align:start position:0%
work during normal hours because when
 
04:29:19.229 --> 04:29:19.239 align:start position:0%
you're a
 
04:29:22.469 --> 04:29:22.479 align:start position:0%
homeschooler uh if you're usually not
 
04:29:23.670 --> 04:29:23.680 align:start position:0%
beholden to the public school that's
 
04:29:24.910 --> 04:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
kind of the point is that you don't want
 
04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
to be doing what the public school is
 
04:29:30.910 --> 04:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
doing so if the point of the bill is to
 
04:29:33.630 --> 04:29:33.640 align:start position:0%
allow them the free reign to just work
 
04:29:34.950 --> 04:29:34.960 align:start position:0%
whenever and then do their schooling
 
04:29:38.109 --> 04:29:38.119 align:start position:0%
whenever works for their family then is
 
04:29:39.710 --> 04:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
that something they're not so what I'm
 
04:29:40.790 --> 04:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
understanding is that's not something
 
04:29:43.429 --> 04:29:43.439 align:start position:0%
they're currently allowed to do my
 
04:29:45.070 --> 04:29:45.080 align:start position:0%
understanding and I will gladly check
 
04:29:47.149 --> 04:29:47.159 align:start position:0%
this as well but my understanding is is
 
04:29:50.469 --> 04:29:50.479 align:start position:0%
that H schools and homeschool programs
 
04:29:53.070 --> 04:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
have to adhere to the school district
 
04:29:55.309 --> 04:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
the purpose of homeschooling is not to
 
04:29:58.070 --> 04:29:58.080 align:start position:0%
do it as you want to do it the purpose
 
04:30:00.309 --> 04:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
of homeschooling by most of the the
 
04:30:02.469 --> 04:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
parents who want to homeschool is
 
04:30:03.950 --> 04:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
because they have their way of wanting
 
04:30:06.030 --> 04:30:06.040 align:start position:0%
to present the information the
 
04:30:07.750 --> 04:30:07.760 align:start position:0%
educational information that their
 
04:30:10.229 --> 04:30:10.239 align:start position:0%
children have to learn but they are
 
04:30:12.870 --> 04:30:12.880 align:start position:0%
subject to the district to which they
 
04:30:15.149 --> 04:30:15.159 align:start position:0%
are affiliated with so if you're
 
04:30:18.510 --> 04:30:18.520 align:start position:0%
homeschooling in B you're subject to
 
04:30:21.109 --> 04:30:21.119 align:start position:0%
Bose's school district and and School
 
04:30:21.119 --> 04:30:23.790 align:start position:0%
Bose's school district and and School
District

04:30:23.790 --> 04:30:23.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:26.990 --> 04:30:27.000 align:start position:0%
rules I don't think we
 
04:30:29.670 --> 04:30:29.680 align:start position:0%
need that is
 
04:30:31.990 --> 04:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
outside this committee is responsible
 
04:30:35.469 --> 04:30:35.479 align:start position:0%
for so I don't think debating that issue
 
04:30:40.750 --> 04:30:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:40.760 --> 04:30:42.349 align:start position:0%
 
to

04:30:42.349 --> 04:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
to
 
04:30:45.590 --> 04:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
wait uh representative kahill thank you
 
04:30:47.670 --> 04:30:47.680 align:start position:0%
Mr chair and thank you m
 
04:30:51.389 --> 04:30:51.399 align:start position:0%
mcra um I'm not sure what's the
 
04:30:53.550 --> 04:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
sponsor's intent was but this this bill
 
04:30:56.630 --> 04:30:56.640 align:start position:0%
refers to no youth under 16 years of age
 
04:30:58.269 --> 04:30:58.279 align:start position:0%
that's not the 17y old that we're
 
04:31:01.830 --> 04:31:01.840 align:start position:0%
familiar with uh so that's a concern but
 
04:31:04.030 --> 04:31:04.040 align:start position:0%
but I think
 
04:31:06.389 --> 04:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
um where's my
 
04:31:08.590 --> 04:31:08.600 align:start position:0%
as far as the the Department of Labor
 
04:31:11.070 --> 04:31:11.080 align:start position:0%
does inspections wage and hour
 
04:31:13.590 --> 04:31:13.600 align:start position:0%
inspections and if you did if you find
 
04:31:17.990 --> 04:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
cards uh time sheets for kids who are uh
 
04:31:20.630 --> 04:31:20.640 align:start position:0%
teenagers and they are not working when
 
04:31:22.109 --> 04:31:22.119 align:start position:0%
they're they're at work when they're
 
04:31:23.429 --> 04:31:23.439 align:start position:0%
supposed to be in school that's when
 
04:31:25.389 --> 04:31:25.399 align:start position:0%
this becomes I think what's in the word
 
04:31:28.590 --> 04:31:28.600 align:start position:0%
of Mr Summers might be called a
 
04:31:31.429 --> 04:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
gotcha so is that that's is this is how
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
it would become known to the department
 
04:31:35.670 --> 04:31:35.680 align:start position:0%
through a through an inspection and and
 
04:31:37.910 --> 04:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
if I are you saying that if they had all
 
04:31:40.149 --> 04:31:40.159 align:start position:0%
the documents from the school and the
 
04:31:42.830 --> 04:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
parent then then there wouldn't be any
 
04:31:45.590 --> 04:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
issue as far as the
 
04:31:48.189 --> 04:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
employer so the the inspectors would go
 
04:31:50.550 --> 04:31:50.560 align:start position:0%
in and they would look exactly like you
 
04:31:51.790 --> 04:31:51.800 align:start position:0%
were saying they would look at the time
 
04:31:53.590 --> 04:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
cards they would see that a child who
 
04:31:55.790 --> 04:31:55.800 align:start position:0%
was supposed to be in school was not in
 
04:31:58.030 --> 04:31:58.040 align:start position:0%
school but was actually working so then
 
04:32:00.109 --> 04:32:00.119 align:start position:0%
the question becomes okay does this
 
04:32:02.550 --> 04:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
child have a schedule that would allow
 
04:32:04.750 --> 04:32:04.760 align:start position:0%
him to work during this particular
 
04:32:05.990 --> 04:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
period of time
 
04:32:08.189 --> 04:32:08.199 align:start position:0%
if the employer has that information in
 
04:32:09.950 --> 04:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
the file if it has a letter from the
 
04:32:11.910 --> 04:32:11.920 align:start position:0%
school that says this child has this
 
04:32:14.510 --> 04:32:14.520 align:start position:0%
required schedule which is slightly
 
04:32:16.389 --> 04:32:16.399 align:start position:0%
different than the full schedule for
 
04:32:19.149 --> 04:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
that District then that would be taken
 
04:32:20.990 --> 04:32:21.000 align:start position:0%
into account and the inspectors would
 
04:32:23.630 --> 04:32:23.640 align:start position:0%
have to make sure that everything is in
 
04:32:25.750 --> 04:32:25.760 align:start position:0%
order the biggest problem that the
 
04:32:27.790 --> 04:32:27.800 align:start position:0%
inspectors have had to this point when
 
04:32:29.830 --> 04:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
there are issues with when a student is
 
04:32:31.950 --> 04:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
allowed to work and not allowed to work
 
04:32:34.189 --> 04:32:34.199 align:start position:0%
is the fact that we are not entitled to
 
04:32:36.990 --> 04:32:37.000 align:start position:0%
get any schedules from the schools that
 
04:32:39.189 --> 04:32:39.199 align:start position:0%
are outside the district schedule that's
 
04:32:41.590 --> 04:32:41.600 align:start position:0%
actually listed on the website in order
 
04:32:43.910 --> 04:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
to get that we need authorization from
 
04:32:47.550 --> 04:32:47.560 align:start position:0%
the parent um and so it becomes a
 
04:32:49.469 --> 04:32:49.479 align:start position:0%
problem for us to be able to prove it
 
04:32:51.189 --> 04:32:51.199 align:start position:0%
but if the documents were in there then
 
04:32:53.070 --> 04:32:53.080 align:start position:0%
the inspectors would have to look at the
 
04:32:54.510 --> 04:32:54.520 align:start position:0%
rest of it and determine whether or not
 
04:32:58.189 --> 04:32:58.199 align:start position:0%
there's anything else missing thank you
 
04:32:58.199 --> 04:33:00.070 align:start position:0%
there's anything else missing thank you
representative

04:33:00.070 --> 04:33:00.080 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:33:03.109 --> 04:33:03.119 align:start position:0%
cokum thank you Mr chair thank you M
 
04:33:05.869 --> 04:33:05.879 align:start position:0%
mcra for taking my question um I have
 
04:33:09.189 --> 04:33:09.199 align:start position:0%
two actually if I'm allowed to ask the
 
04:33:12.590 --> 04:33:12.600 align:start position:0%
two it says in the law that we um will
 
04:33:15.109 --> 04:33:15.119 align:start position:0%
provide work certificates for these
 
04:33:16.830 --> 04:33:16.840 align:start position:0%
children to work that they must they
 
04:33:18.510 --> 04:33:18.520 align:start position:0%
they shall have a work certificate with
 
04:33:20.750 --> 04:33:20.760 align:start position:0%
a couple of exceptions is this something
 
04:33:22.551 --> 04:33:22.561 align:start position:0%
that maybe could be incorporated as part
 
04:33:24.349 --> 04:33:24.359 align:start position:0%
of their work certificate to allow them
 
04:33:27.709 --> 04:33:27.719 align:start position:0%
the ability to to be able to work um in
 
04:33:29.629 --> 04:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
a certain schedule I I'm not really
 
04:33:31.470 --> 04:33:31.480 align:start position:0%
familiar with the work certificates so I
 
04:33:32.910 --> 04:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
apologize for
 
04:33:35.310 --> 04:33:35.320 align:start position:0%
that I think the answer to that un
 
04:33:36.990 --> 04:33:37.000 align:start position:0%
unfortunately is the legal answer which
 
04:33:39.629 --> 04:33:39.639 align:start position:0%
is it depends it's going
 
04:33:41.670 --> 04:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
to there are things that we would have
 
04:33:43.750 --> 04:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
to look at whether or not the schedule
 
04:33:45.750 --> 04:33:45.760 align:start position:0%
changes the schedule could change on a
 
04:33:47.230 --> 04:33:47.240 align:start position:0%
quarterly basis their schedule could
 
04:33:50.150 --> 04:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
change on a semester basis um is that
 
04:33:51.910 --> 04:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
something that you know would require
 
04:33:54.709 --> 04:33:54.719 align:start position:0%
additional information being submitted
 
04:33:56.269 --> 04:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
um I think that there
 
04:33:59.390 --> 04:33:59.400 align:start position:0%
are so many questions and so many
 
04:34:02.629 --> 04:34:02.639 align:start position:0%
problems with respect to trying to do
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
something here where we are
 
04:34:08.789 --> 04:34:08.799 align:start position:0%
really trying to almost individualize an
 
04:34:12.830 --> 04:34:12.840 align:start position:0%
employees schedule to fit something that
 
04:34:16.269 --> 04:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
an employer can allow one person to work
 
04:34:17.869 --> 04:34:17.879 align:start position:0%
this hour and this person to work this
 
04:34:19.750 --> 04:34:19.760 align:start position:0%
hour I think that the problems are just
 
04:34:23.269 --> 04:34:23.279 align:start position:0%
so replete throughout this that I'm not
 
04:34:26.390 --> 04:34:26.400 align:start position:0%
100% sure that I would be able to site
 
04:34:28.429 --> 04:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
every single thing that an inspector
 
04:34:30.510 --> 04:34:30.520 align:start position:0%
would be looking for versus what the law
 
04:34:33.390 --> 04:34:33.400 align:start position:0%
is going to require of them to do I'd
 
04:34:34.869 --> 04:34:34.879 align:start position:0%
like to see this a little bit further
 
04:34:36.590 --> 04:34:36.600 align:start position:0%
down the the line and then take it to
 
04:34:39.390 --> 04:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
our Inspection Division for review thank
 
04:34:42.390 --> 04:34:42.400 align:start position:0%
you on that um subject I'd like to
 
04:34:44.789 --> 04:34:44.799 align:start position:0%
transition that into the work programs
 
04:34:46.510 --> 04:34:46.520 align:start position:0%
that they already have with school kids
 
04:34:48.510 --> 04:34:48.520 align:start position:0%
today so kids are allowed to attend
 
04:34:50.551 --> 04:34:50.561 align:start position:0%
school during a certain time and then
 
04:34:52.109 --> 04:34:52.119 align:start position:0%
they are allowed to go off and work on
 
04:34:54.789 --> 04:34:54.799 align:start position:0%
their job or at a job as part of their
 
04:34:56.949 --> 04:34:56.959 align:start position:0%
education process so there must be some
 
04:34:58.551 --> 04:34:58.561 align:start position:0%
method that we're managing that right
 
04:35:01.551 --> 04:35:01.561 align:start position:0%
now as well so would this not fall into
 
04:35:02.830 --> 04:35:02.840 align:start position:0%
a similar
 
04:35:05.429 --> 04:35:05.439 align:start position:0%
situation from what I've seen and this
 
04:35:07.949 --> 04:35:07.959 align:start position:0%
is not 100% with everyone but from what
 
04:35:09.990 --> 04:35:10.000 align:start position:0%
I've seen is that whenever there is any
 
04:35:12.029 --> 04:35:12.039 align:start position:0%
kind of a program with a students in
 
04:35:13.670 --> 04:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
just for instance school in the morning
 
04:35:15.990 --> 04:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
in high school and then in the afternoon
 
04:35:18.789 --> 04:35:18.799 align:start position:0%
they're going to either a different type
 
04:35:20.230 --> 04:35:20.240 align:start position:0%
of school whether it's a technical
 
04:35:22.990 --> 04:35:23.000 align:start position:0%
school or they're going to a job as part
 
04:35:24.590 --> 04:35:24.600 align:start position:0%
of an apprenticeship or as part of what
 
04:35:26.070 --> 04:35:26.080 align:start position:0%
they're doing in high school there's
 
04:35:28.470 --> 04:35:28.480 align:start position:0%
still documentation with the school and
 
04:35:30.189 --> 04:35:30.199 align:start position:0%
that documentation can be obtained
 
04:35:33.990 --> 04:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
either through parental consent or um
 
04:35:37.949 --> 04:35:37.959 align:start position:0%
having the the School provide an actual
 
04:35:40.150 --> 04:35:40.160 align:start position:0%
copy with the parent giving consent to
 
04:35:43.070 --> 04:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:46.109 --> 04:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
so follow up thank
 
04:35:49.910 --> 04:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
you so am I understanding correctly that
 
04:35:52.551 --> 04:35:52.561 align:start position:0%
the way that we're describing this
 
04:35:55.070 --> 04:35:55.080 align:start position:0%
happening today is
 
04:35:57.629 --> 04:35:57.639 align:start position:0%
that youth in order for a youth to be
 
04:35:59.310 --> 04:35:59.320 align:start position:0%
able to work they have to get permission
 
04:36:01.109 --> 04:36:01.119 align:start position:0%
from the school rather than from their
 
04:36:02.910 --> 04:36:02.920 align:start position:0%
parent so the school would be control
 
04:36:04.349 --> 04:36:04.359 align:start position:0%
even if they're they're homeschool
 
04:36:05.429 --> 04:36:05.439 align:start position:0%
they're homeschooled in school has
 
04:36:07.789 --> 04:36:07.799 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with their education no
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
okay no no if I may answer this is
 
04:36:14.189 --> 04:36:14.199 align:start position:0%
talking about not getting permission to
 
04:36:18.150 --> 04:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
work this is getting a a a definitive
 
04:36:20.429 --> 04:36:20.439 align:start position:0%
ability to work because school is in
 
04:36:22.551 --> 04:36:22.561 align:start position:0%
session and an employer saying school is
 
04:36:24.869 --> 04:36:24.879 align:start position:0%
in session how do I know you can or
 
04:36:27.029 --> 04:36:27.039 align:start position:0%
cannot work if you're putting that
 
04:36:29.109 --> 04:36:29.119 align:start position:0%
language into this bill that says when
 
04:36:32.390 --> 04:36:32.400 align:start position:0%
they're not required to be at school
 
04:36:36.349 --> 04:36:36.359 align:start position:0%
this isn't a matter of whether um the
 
04:36:38.629 --> 04:36:38.639 align:start position:0%
parent is asking the question this is
 
04:36:40.470 --> 04:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
the employer trying to find out whether
 
04:36:42.590 --> 04:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
or not they're going to violate the law
 
04:36:44.510 --> 04:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
by allowing a student to work from 1 to
 
04:36:46.269 --> 04:36:46.279 align:start position:0%
3:00 in the afternoon when school
 
04:36:48.869 --> 04:36:48.879 align:start position:0%
technically is in session so no this is
 
04:36:50.349 --> 04:36:50.359 align:start position:0%
not the school telling them when they
 
04:36:52.990 --> 04:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
can work this is what the program is
 
04:36:54.269 --> 04:36:54.279 align:start position:0%
it's not the parents telling them when
 
04:36:56.429 --> 04:36:56.439 align:start position:0%
they can work it's what the program is
 
04:36:58.510 --> 04:36:58.520 align:start position:0%
and the rest of it is going to be
 
04:36:58.520 --> 04:37:01.551 align:start position:0%
and the rest of it is going to be
parental

04:37:01.551 --> 04:37:01.561 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:03.750 --> 04:37:03.760 align:start position:0%
discussion I do have a question and I
 
04:37:05.189 --> 04:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
think you might have already told told
 
04:37:06.869 --> 04:37:06.879 align:start position:0%
me you want to go back and research this
 
04:37:09.029 --> 04:37:09.039 align:start position:0%
but do you you said they will be
 
04:37:11.750 --> 04:37:11.760 align:start position:0%
violating the law and the sponsor said
 
04:37:13.789 --> 04:37:13.799 align:start position:0%
she couldn't find she didn't know which
 
04:37:15.670 --> 04:37:15.680 align:start position:0%
law we were talking about do you know
 
04:37:21.830 --> 04:37:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:25.310 --> 04:37:25.320 align:start position:0%
case I would think that it's the and and
 
04:37:26.830 --> 04:37:26.840 align:start position:0%
again this is the one that I wanted to
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
go back and research and make sure but I
 
04:37:32.269 --> 04:37:32.279 align:start position:0%
think what we're looking at here is the
 
04:37:34.070 --> 04:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
uh the the portion of the wage and hour
 
04:37:36.349 --> 04:37:36.359 align:start position:0%
law when it talks to to the youth about
 
04:37:37.910 --> 04:37:37.920 align:start position:0%
when they're allowed to work during the
 
04:37:39.830 --> 04:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
school year during the work week when
 
04:37:42.349 --> 04:37:42.359 align:start position:0%
they were allowed to work during the uh
 
04:37:46.949 --> 04:37:46.959 align:start position:0%
vacation periods uh vacation Summers um
 
04:37:48.551 --> 04:37:48.561 align:start position:0%
and making sure that they're not working
 
04:37:51.150 --> 04:37:51.160 align:start position:0%
in excess of their hours and and things
 
04:37:53.510 --> 04:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
like that that's where I want to compare
 
04:37:56.230 --> 04:37:56.240 align:start position:0%
them to um if I said there was a
 
04:37:58.709 --> 04:37:58.719 align:start position:0%
violation I that was a mistake because I
 
04:38:00.150 --> 04:38:00.160 align:start position:0%
really don't know the answer to it which
 
04:38:01.949 --> 04:38:01.959 align:start position:0%
is why I want to do the research on it
 
04:38:03.990 --> 04:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
all right thanks I didn't mean to no
 
04:38:05.510 --> 04:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
that's okay that's okay
 
04:38:08.470 --> 04:38:08.480 align:start position:0%
and uh representative dgo and then I see
 
04:38:11.269 --> 04:38:11.279 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
04:38:14.949 --> 04:38:14.959 align:start position:0%
taking my question um maybe the
 
04:38:17.310 --> 04:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
Department of Labor can provide this for
 
04:38:19.310 --> 04:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
an answer to I know you have to you're
 
04:38:21.590 --> 04:38:21.600 align:start position:0%
mentioning having to provide um May the
 
04:38:23.551 --> 04:38:23.561 align:start position:0%
school calendar something along those
 
04:38:25.590 --> 04:38:25.600 align:start position:0%
lines to an employer so they would know
 
04:38:27.750 --> 04:38:27.760 align:start position:0%
the school hours if a child is
 
04:38:29.429 --> 04:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
homeschooled they're not getting a
 
04:38:31.510 --> 04:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
school calendar so would the Department
 
04:38:33.990 --> 04:38:34.000 align:start position:0%
of Labor or the employer would it be
 
04:38:36.230 --> 04:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient to have the letter of intent
 
04:38:38.070 --> 04:38:38.080 align:start position:0%
that the school district signed off
 
04:38:40.349 --> 04:38:40.359 align:start position:0%
saying you're okay to homeschool would
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
that would that
 
04:38:46.189 --> 04:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
count well obviously I can't speak to
 
04:38:48.590 --> 04:38:48.600 align:start position:0%
whether or not that particular issue
 
04:38:50.949 --> 04:38:50.959 align:start position:0%
would count but my understanding and it
 
04:38:54.750 --> 04:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
has been strongly um instilled in me
 
04:38:57.510 --> 04:38:57.520 align:start position:0%
that homeschoolers have to follow the
 
04:39:00.150 --> 04:39:00.160 align:start position:0%
district schedule so even if a
 
04:39:02.670 --> 04:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
homeschooler themselves do not have a
 
04:39:04.551 --> 04:39:04.561 align:start position:0%
district schedule themselves they have
 
04:39:06.750 --> 04:39:06.760 align:start position:0%
to follow as I said if you're
 
04:39:08.429 --> 04:39:08.439 align:start position:0%
homeschooling in Bow you follow the
 
04:39:09.949 --> 04:39:09.959 align:start position:0%
district schedule when I'm talking about
 
04:39:11.429 --> 04:39:11.439 align:start position:0%
a district schedule I'm not talking
 
04:39:14.029 --> 04:39:14.039 align:start position:0%
about the hours of the day I'm talking
 
04:39:15.670 --> 04:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
about the days of the week that they're
 
04:39:18.869 --> 04:39:18.879 align:start position:0%
off if Bo is off on Friday for a teacher
 
04:39:21.310 --> 04:39:21.320 align:start position:0%
workday then a homeschooler can be off
 
04:39:23.949 --> 04:39:23.959 align:start position:0%
on Friday if Bo is off for a week for
 
04:39:26.949 --> 04:39:26.959 align:start position:0%
for and I'm sorry for B I'm just using
 
04:39:30.310 --> 04:39:30.320 align:start position:0%
one word I apologize but if Bo is off
 
04:39:32.029 --> 04:39:32.039 align:start position:0%
this particular week for their winter
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
break then that homeschooler will be off
 
04:39:36.189 --> 04:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
that week for a particular for that
 
04:39:38.510 --> 04:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
break that's the district schedule that
 
04:39:40.350 --> 04:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
I'm talking about I'm not talking about
 
04:39:42.350 --> 04:39:42.360 align:start position:0%
a daily schedule because that's where I
 
04:39:44.030 --> 04:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
wanted to do a little bit more research
 
04:39:45.470 --> 04:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
on as to whether or not that has to
 
04:39:48.628 --> 04:39:48.638 align:start position:0%
comport if the school is 8 to4 does
 
04:39:51.030 --> 04:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
homeschooling have to be 8 to4 my
 
04:39:54.628 --> 04:39:54.638 align:start position:0%
initial instinct is no it does not but
 
04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
I'd like to do more research on that and
 
04:39:57.910 --> 04:39:57.920 align:start position:0%
that was pursuant to representative
 
04:40:00.150 --> 04:40:00.160 align:start position:0%
Granger's question too so I will gladly
 
04:40:03.150 --> 04:40:03.160 align:start position:0%
share that research follow up follow all
 
04:40:05.310 --> 04:40:05.320 align:start position:0%
right so yeah can you
 
04:40:08.070 --> 04:40:08.080 align:start position:0%
I would be interested in KN that I'm a
 
04:40:11.190 --> 04:40:11.200 align:start position:0%
homeschooled dad myself and I actually
 
04:40:12.430 --> 04:40:12.440 align:start position:0%
I'm thinking it's actually the other way
 
04:40:14.310 --> 04:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
around we don't follow the school
 
04:40:15.868 --> 04:40:15.878 align:start position:0%
district calendar and I I'll give you a
 
04:40:15.878 --> 04:40:17.550 align:start position:0%
district calendar and I I'll give you a
perfect

04:40:17.550 --> 04:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
04:40:20.150 --> 04:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
example February vacation we take the
 
04:40:21.670 --> 04:40:21.680 align:start position:0%
vacation the week after because we don't
 
04:40:25.310 --> 04:40:25.320 align:start position:0%
want to pay the up price in ski tickets
 
04:40:26.948 --> 04:40:26.958 align:start position:0%
for the vacation week so we just do it a
 
04:40:28.510 --> 04:40:28.520 align:start position:0%
week after but I think as a homeschooled
 
04:40:29.708 --> 04:40:29.718 align:start position:0%
family you're allowed to do that now if
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
I wanted to let my kids work that week
 
04:40:34.310 --> 04:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
I'm curious as to see the stance on that
 
04:40:36.230 --> 04:40:36.240 align:start position:0%
as to why by I'm just taking the
 
04:40:39.150 --> 04:40:39.160 align:start position:0%
vacation the week after um you know and
 
04:40:40.670 --> 04:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
even our schooling schedule is not
 
04:40:42.948 --> 04:40:42.958 align:start position:0%
always the same we some H School
 
04:40:45.708 --> 04:40:45.718 align:start position:0%
families school all summer long take a
 
04:40:47.390 --> 04:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
longer winter break they do all sorts of
 
04:40:50.190 --> 04:40:50.200 align:start position:0%
stuff so I I think it would be good to
 
04:40:51.550 --> 04:40:51.560 align:start position:0%
get some clarity on that because I think
 
04:40:53.430 --> 04:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
that's a huge I think the intent of this
 
04:40:57.390 --> 04:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
bill was really the mass population was
 
04:40:59.030 --> 04:40:59.040 align:start position:0%
affecting homeschool families and laying
 
04:41:01.310 --> 04:41:01.320 align:start position:0%
a homeschool child who gets out at noon
 
04:41:03.910 --> 04:41:03.920 align:start position:0%
be able to work for the afternoon um
 
04:41:04.788 --> 04:41:04.798 align:start position:0%
that's going to be the biggest
 
04:41:06.868 --> 04:41:06.878 align:start position:0%
population here so I think if there's
 
04:41:09.510 --> 04:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
nothing prohibiting them then maybe this
 
04:41:12.510 --> 04:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
bill is not necessarily needed but if
 
04:41:13.590 --> 04:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
there is something prohibiting a
 
04:41:15.590 --> 04:41:15.600 align:start position:0%
homeschool child who might work on
 
04:41:18.430 --> 04:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
Alternate schedule then uh then I think
 
04:41:19.750 --> 04:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
there's something to be said for this
 
04:41:22.150 --> 04:41:22.160 align:start position:0%
bill and we need to figure out a way to
 
04:41:24.510 --> 04:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
work on to correct it or whatever so if
 
04:41:26.030 --> 04:41:26.040 align:start position:0%
you could just provide some clarity
 
04:41:27.190 --> 04:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
that'd be
 
04:41:30.030 --> 04:41:30.040 align:start position:0%
awesome after I do some research perfect
 
04:41:32.110 --> 04:41:32.120 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
stop thank you thank you for taking my
 
04:41:36.708 --> 04:41:36.718 align:start position:0%
question question Miss McGrath um I'm
 
04:41:38.990 --> 04:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
going to go in the way back machine here
 
04:41:42.070 --> 04:41:42.080 align:start position:0%
um some 50 years ago this bill in
 
04:41:45.390 --> 04:41:45.400 align:start position:0%
particular I want to note is refers to
 
04:41:48.470 --> 04:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
Children between the ages of 12 and 15
 
04:41:50.590 --> 04:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
there are different sets of rules for
 
04:41:54.310 --> 04:41:54.320 align:start position:0%
for um students who are 16 and older but
 
04:41:57.948 --> 04:41:57.958 align:start position:0%
um back in in the day um when I and my
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
friends were 14 years old I went with a
 
04:42:03.110 --> 04:42:03.120 align:start position:0%
number of them to the school district
 
04:42:06.070 --> 04:42:06.080 align:start position:0%
office to get a work permit that would
 
04:42:09.390 --> 04:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
allow them to work at age 14 in the
 
04:42:11.830 --> 04:42:11.840 align:start position:0%
summer youth program or at the local
 
04:42:15.830 --> 04:42:15.840 align:start position:0%
McDonald's is that um law still in place
 
04:42:15.840 --> 04:42:17.030 align:start position:0%
McDonald's is that um law still in place
and

04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:42:22.310 --> 04:42:22.320 align:start position:0%
um I'm just just curious how um if the
 
04:42:25.788 --> 04:42:25.798 align:start position:0%
laws have changed since the
 
04:42:30.510 --> 04:42:30.520 align:start position:0%
1970s thank you I going to Sid step your
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
question with this answer which is that
 
04:42:36.110 --> 04:42:36.120 align:start position:0%
from this bill it seems like there are a
 
04:42:37.670 --> 04:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
lot of questions there's a lot of
 
04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
concerns there's also a lot of um
 
04:42:43.110 --> 04:42:43.120 align:start position:0%
information that's coming in there's a
 
04:42:44.788 --> 04:42:44.798 align:start position:0%
lot of information that's being asked of
 
04:42:47.110 --> 04:42:47.120 align:start position:0%
the Department of Labor and I want to
 
04:42:49.150 --> 04:42:49.160 align:start position:0%
make sure that what I'm providing is
 
04:42:51.110 --> 04:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
accurate information instead of having
 
04:42:53.390 --> 04:42:53.400 align:start position:0%
to come back and tell you that I gave
 
04:42:54.510 --> 04:42:54.520 align:start position:0%
you wrong
 
04:42:57.948 --> 04:42:57.958 align:start position:0%
information uh so with your permission
 
04:43:00.750 --> 04:43:00.760 align:start position:0%
representative strob and uh chairman
 
04:43:03.190 --> 04:43:03.200 align:start position:0%
seaworth I would like to do research on
 
04:43:07.510 --> 04:43:07.520 align:start position:0%
that to find out um there are people at
 
04:43:09.230 --> 04:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
our Inspections Division that would be
 
04:43:10.788 --> 04:43:10.798 align:start position:0%
able to answer these questions very
 
04:43:13.310 --> 04:43:13.320 align:start position:0%
quickly and provide me with the research
 
04:43:15.510 --> 04:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
and then I would be more than happy to
 
04:43:17.628 --> 04:43:17.638 align:start position:0%
put it in a summary and send it to the
 
04:43:17.638 --> 04:43:18.910 align:start position:0%
put it in a summary and send it to the
entire

04:43:18.910 --> 04:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
entire
 
04:43:23.110 --> 04:43:23.120 align:start position:0%
committee and I'll offer I I like that
 
04:43:26.948 --> 04:43:26.958 align:start position:0%
answer and I I I will look forward to to
 
04:43:29.990 --> 04:43:30.000 align:start position:0%
your response I will provide a quick
 
04:43:33.190 --> 04:43:33.200 align:start position:0%
answer from my perspective as having
 
04:43:35.470 --> 04:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
been on this committee a number of years
 
04:43:39.310 --> 04:43:39.320 align:start position:0%
and having worked on some of that um the
 
04:43:40.910 --> 04:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
the first thing I'd point out because a
 
04:43:43.070 --> 04:43:43.080 align:start position:0%
couple people have said it this
 
04:43:45.470 --> 04:43:45.480 align:start position:0%
bill and I think it's one of the
 
04:43:48.190 --> 04:43:48.200 align:start position:0%
problems with this bill but as it was
 
04:43:51.670 --> 04:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
proposed it actually has sections that
 
04:43:55.030 --> 04:43:55.040 align:start position:0%
some are for the under 16 and some are
 
04:43:58.430 --> 04:43:58.440 align:start position:0%
for 16 and 17 so you have to be careful
 
04:44:00.430 --> 04:44:00.440 align:start position:0%
of which section you're reading when you
 
04:44:03.750 --> 04:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
try to connect it and and it is a very
 
04:44:05.708 --> 04:44:05.718 align:start position:0%
different legal landscape for those two
 
04:44:09.430 --> 04:44:09.440 align:start position:0%
groups so that's one caution um in terms
 
04:44:12.310 --> 04:44:12.320 align:start position:0%
of that work certificate for the younger
 
04:44:16.910 --> 04:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
group that it it is still in law um
 
04:44:20.390 --> 04:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
however it has changed and it changed
 
04:44:22.070 --> 04:44:22.080 align:start position:0%
somebody else might remember it was a
 
04:44:25.470 --> 04:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
few years ago where it addressed this
 
04:44:29.350 --> 04:44:29.360 align:start position:0%
issue of someone who's not associated
 
04:44:32.470 --> 04:44:32.480 align:start position:0%
with a school district it allows the
 
04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
parents to provide
 
04:44:38.030 --> 04:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
the certificate of authorization in that
 
04:44:42.550 --> 04:44:42.560 align:start position:0%
case um a lot of the schools and it it
 
04:44:45.470 --> 04:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
uh former representative the department
 
04:44:47.470 --> 04:44:47.480 align:start position:0%
brought up there's a triplicate form
 
04:44:49.510 --> 04:44:49.520 align:start position:0%
with three different colors and a lot of
 
04:44:51.470 --> 04:44:51.480 align:start position:0%
the schools actually use that and one of
 
04:44:53.868 --> 04:44:53.878 align:start position:0%
the question is we really make them use
 
04:44:55.628 --> 04:44:55.638 align:start position:0%
that that colored form and and the
 
04:44:58.590 --> 04:44:58.600 align:start position:0%
answer is no it's not required but
 
04:45:00.510 --> 04:45:00.520 align:start position:0%
because it's what the department has if
 
04:45:03.030 --> 04:45:03.040 align:start position:0%
a district asks well what do what do we
 
04:45:04.910 --> 04:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
do what do we need for this they they'll
 
04:45:06.990 --> 04:45:07.000 align:start position:0%
provide the form that's been in use for
 
04:45:10.990 --> 04:45:11.000 align:start position:0%
years so partial answer to tied us over
 
04:45:13.350 --> 04:45:13.360 align:start position:0%
until we get the complete
 
04:45:17.110 --> 04:45:17.120 align:start position:0%
answer um representative
 
04:45:19.350 --> 04:45:19.360 align:start position:0%
blow thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
04:45:21.310 --> 04:45:21.320 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh I'd just like some
 
04:45:23.270 --> 04:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
clarification when you when you said
 
04:45:26.750 --> 04:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
that um you know that employers uh
 
04:45:30.110 --> 04:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
wouldn't wouldn't want to are prohibited
 
04:45:33.150 --> 04:45:33.160 align:start position:0%
from um you know changing schedules and
 
04:45:35.230 --> 04:45:35.240 align:start position:0%
juggling schedules like like uh you know
 
04:45:37.070 --> 04:45:37.080 align:start position:0%
with different kids uh you know if you
 
04:45:38.310 --> 04:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
had a homeschool kid that could come to
 
04:45:40.070 --> 04:45:40.080 align:start position:0%
work at 6:00 in the morning he doesn't
 
04:45:41.910 --> 04:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
start school till 12:00 you know with
 
04:45:45.230 --> 04:45:45.240 align:start position:0%
his parents um and you said that uh you
 
04:45:48.510 --> 04:45:48.520 align:start position:0%
know that employers would uh I wasn't
 
04:45:51.070 --> 04:45:51.080 align:start position:0%
sure if you said prohibited or
 
04:45:54.150 --> 04:45:54.160 align:start position:0%
no they're not okay so an employer is
 
04:45:56.910 --> 04:45:56.920 align:start position:0%
not allowed to contact a school district
 
04:46:00.628 --> 04:46:00.638 align:start position:0%
and say I need a kid schedule um the uh
 
04:46:03.550 --> 04:46:03.560 align:start position:0%
fura rules the uh federal education
 
04:46:05.910 --> 04:46:05.920 align:start position:0%
protection act rules they basically say
 
04:46:07.948 --> 04:46:07.958 align:start position:0%
that no one else has access to those
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
records except for the child and the
 
04:46:12.230 --> 04:46:12.240 align:start position:0%
parent so the the employer can't do that
 
04:46:15.190 --> 04:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
the employer can however either ask for
 
04:46:17.708 --> 04:46:17.718 align:start position:0%
the parent to provide notification from
 
04:46:20.948 --> 04:46:20.958 align:start position:0%
the school um I don't see anything in
 
04:46:23.910 --> 04:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
there that allows for just a simple note
 
04:46:25.628 --> 04:46:25.638 align:start position:0%
but this is just for a protective
 
04:46:28.430 --> 04:46:28.440 align:start position:0%
measure that's uh one of the reasons
 
04:46:31.270 --> 04:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
that this rule is in place it's just so
 
04:46:32.788 --> 04:46:32.798 align:start position:0%
that somebody doesn't call up and find
 
04:46:35.830 --> 04:46:35.840 align:start position:0%
out where a child is at any given time
 
04:46:44.548 --> 04:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:48.750 --> 04:46:48.760 align:start position:0%
sure do you want to ask it so uh the
 
04:46:51.788 --> 04:46:51.798 align:start position:0%
question was he asked if you said rule
 
04:46:54.548 --> 04:46:54.558 align:start position:0%
or law and I think you you mentioned an
 
04:46:56.510 --> 04:46:56.520 align:start position:0%
acronym it sounded like a
 
04:46:59.788 --> 04:46:59.798 align:start position:0%
federal it's furpa federal education
 
04:47:02.590 --> 04:47:02.600 align:start position:0%
rights and Privacy Act F RP
 
04:47:06.750 --> 04:47:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:08.510 --> 04:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you Mr M uh
 
04:47:09.628 --> 04:47:09.638 align:start position:0%
representative love brought it up and
 
04:47:11.150 --> 04:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that it was a rule or a
 
04:47:14.310 --> 04:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
law that didn't prevent the parent I
 
04:47:18.190 --> 04:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
said rule that's right is is is it in
 
04:47:22.510 --> 04:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
your labor rules or is it a rule of law
 
04:47:24.510 --> 04:47:24.520 align:start position:0%
it's under the federal it's under the
 
04:47:28.390 --> 04:47:28.400 align:start position:0%
federal F rules so it's oh it's under it
 
04:47:30.430 --> 04:47:30.440 align:start position:0%
the federal rule Federal rule federal
 
04:47:32.230 --> 04:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
law yeah we'll clarify that too if you'd
 
04:47:34.110 --> 04:47:34.120 align:start position:0%
like I just want to make sure it's not
 
04:47:36.628 --> 04:47:36.638 align:start position:0%
in our labor laws that we're overlooking
 
04:47:37.590 --> 04:47:37.600 align:start position:0%
here in the
 
04:47:39.990 --> 04:47:40.000 align:start position:0%
state I believe we follow the federal on
 
04:47:41.628 --> 04:47:41.638 align:start position:0%
that one perfect thank you thank you Mr
 
04:47:44.350 --> 04:47:44.360 align:start position:0%
chairman and if I can before and I
 
04:47:46.868 --> 04:47:46.878 align:start position:0%
apologize chairman seaworth a lot of the
 
04:47:48.948 --> 04:47:48.958 align:start position:0%
questions that are being asked and while
 
04:47:50.628 --> 04:47:50.638 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to do whatever
 
04:47:52.390 --> 04:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
research I can from the Department of
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
Labor a lot of the questions that are
 
04:47:55.990 --> 04:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
being asked are actually questions from
 
04:47:59.190 --> 04:47:59.200 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education and so I
 
04:48:00.990 --> 04:48:01.000 align:start position:0%
cannot speak to the Department of
 
04:48:02.830 --> 04:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
Education and I do not ever want to
 
04:48:04.590 --> 04:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
speak for them
 
04:48:06.708 --> 04:48:06.718 align:start position:0%
uh so I just want to make sure that you
 
04:48:09.030 --> 04:48:09.040 align:start position:0%
understand that I'm looking at this more
 
04:48:10.390 --> 04:48:10.400 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Labor's
 
04:48:12.230 --> 04:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
perspective how we would treat a case
 
04:48:14.350 --> 04:48:14.360 align:start position:0%
that came in the concerns that we're
 
04:48:17.270 --> 04:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
getting phone calls on trying to find
 
04:48:18.868 --> 04:48:18.878 align:start position:0%
information and how they can get
 
04:48:24.070 --> 04:48:24.080 align:start position:0%
information so I I'm not trying to um
 
04:48:27.150 --> 04:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
sideswipe any of your your questions and
 
04:48:28.750 --> 04:48:28.760 align:start position:0%
I do believe though the Department of
 
04:48:32.310 --> 04:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
Education might be helpful to get some
 
04:48:35.830 --> 04:48:35.840 align:start position:0%
information from yes and that's what I
 
04:48:38.230 --> 04:48:38.240 align:start position:0%
was going to say too is that so for
 
04:48:39.670 --> 04:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
example that
 
04:48:44.230 --> 04:48:44.240 align:start position:0%
law the furpa is not labor law it's it's
 
04:48:47.190 --> 04:48:47.200 align:start position:0%
education law and likewise truancy falls
 
04:48:50.830 --> 04:48:50.840 align:start position:0%
under education law not labor law what
 
04:48:54.548 --> 04:48:54.558 align:start position:0%
would be interesting as you do your
 
04:49:00.070 --> 04:49:00.080 align:start position:0%
research um if you can clarify it for us
 
04:49:03.230 --> 04:49:03.240 align:start position:0%
is if the Department of Labor in
 
04:49:03.240 --> 04:49:04.910 align:start position:0%
is if the Department of Labor in
enforcing

04:49:04.910 --> 04:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
enforcing
 
04:49:08.868 --> 04:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
something is relying
 
04:49:12.310 --> 04:49:12.320 align:start position:0%
on a body of law that's outside of Labor
 
04:49:14.708 --> 04:49:14.718 align:start position:0%
so for example if it says something in
 
04:49:19.070 --> 04:49:19.080 align:start position:0%
treny that you can't do X does an
 
04:49:21.350 --> 04:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
inspector from Department of Labor come
 
04:49:24.230 --> 04:49:24.240 align:start position:0%
in and say well you know it says it over
 
04:49:26.830 --> 04:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
in this other area because that's what
 
04:49:28.948 --> 04:49:28.958 align:start position:0%
that confuses me and probably some other
 
04:49:30.670 --> 04:49:30.680 align:start position:0%
members of the committee is where when
 
04:49:33.150 --> 04:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
we look at our labor laws if there's
 
04:49:35.390 --> 04:49:35.400 align:start position:0%
something that's not not there but yet
 
04:49:37.990 --> 04:49:38.000 align:start position:0%
inspectors still rely on we're going to
 
04:49:40.510 --> 04:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
miss that I think it's a good question I
 
04:49:43.548 --> 04:49:43.558 align:start position:0%
have no problem doing that thank
 
04:49:45.670 --> 04:49:45.680 align:start position:0%
you another question representative
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
kahill thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
04:49:50.788 --> 04:49:50.798 align:start position:0%
Mr McGrath patience so I just wanted to
 
04:49:53.150 --> 04:49:53.160 align:start position:0%
get it out there that in for the the
 
04:49:56.070 --> 04:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
employer that's operating with a an with
 
04:49:58.390 --> 04:49:58.400 align:start position:0%
where their employees coming from two or
 
04:50:01.430 --> 04:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
more school districts uh anybody can get
 
04:50:04.350 --> 04:50:04.360 align:start position:0%
the the schedule online they all have
 
04:50:06.788 --> 04:50:06.798 align:start position:0%
them there and the employer can have
 
04:50:08.750 --> 04:50:08.760 align:start position:0%
them and and sort them and color code
 
04:50:11.190 --> 04:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
them by which employer so that it's easy
 
04:50:13.948 --> 04:50:13.958 align:start position:0%
for them to know who can work what days
 
04:50:16.948 --> 04:50:16.958 align:start position:0%
and what hours is that correct yes and
 
04:50:18.590 --> 04:50:18.600 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about the district
 
04:50:19.948 --> 04:50:19.958 align:start position:0%
schedules that are out there obviously
 
04:50:21.990 --> 04:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
not individual student schedules right
 
04:50:23.670 --> 04:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
but the district schedules are out there
 
04:50:26.270 --> 04:50:26.280 align:start position:0%
at every single school's website and
 
04:50:28.070 --> 04:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
follow up and this is what the
 
04:50:30.548 --> 04:50:30.558 align:start position:0%
department inspectors hang their hat
 
04:50:33.548 --> 04:50:33.558 align:start position:0%
on at this point in time yes if there's
 
04:50:35.948 --> 04:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
going to be some kind of change or some
 
04:50:38.270 --> 04:50:38.280 align:start position:0%
kind of um alteration to whatever's
 
04:50:40.150 --> 04:50:40.160 align:start position:0%
going on here then we might have to look
 
04:50:41.628 --> 04:50:41.638 align:start position:0%
a little bit further and see whether or
 
04:50:43.830 --> 04:50:43.840 align:start position:0%
not there is a a student who is working
 
04:50:46.670 --> 04:50:46.680 align:start position:0%
during school hours but has the ability
 
04:50:53.070 --> 04:50:53.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:55.270 --> 04:50:55.280 align:start position:0%
you thank you very
 
04:50:58.430 --> 04:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
much if there are any other questions um
 
04:51:01.510 --> 04:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
I actually got another card so I'm very
 
04:51:03.868 --> 04:51:03.878 align:start position:0%
excited to call the next person you
 
04:51:05.830 --> 04:51:05.840 align:start position:0%
nobody else knew I had
 
04:51:09.190 --> 04:51:09.200 align:start position:0%
this um so thank you very much and uh
 
04:51:12.030 --> 04:51:12.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate you taking some some some
 
04:51:13.708 --> 04:51:13.718 align:start position:0%
heat from us there
 
04:51:16.750 --> 04:51:16.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and so next I'd like to ask Mike
 
04:51:19.548 --> 04:51:19.558 align:start position:0%
Summers uh of the New Hampshire lodging
 
04:51:21.990 --> 04:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
and Restaurant Association to come up
 
04:51:24.230 --> 04:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
and speak he's not signed in in favor or
 
04:51:26.230 --> 04:51:26.240 align:start position:0%
against the bill but hopefully with his
 
04:51:28.548 --> 04:51:28.558 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the industry he can help
 
04:51:30.990 --> 04:51:31.000 align:start position:0%
clarify some of the questions that we've
 
04:51:33.670 --> 04:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
been having uh thank you Mr chairman
 
04:51:34.750 --> 04:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee he might have
 
04:51:36.590 --> 04:51:36.600 align:start position:0%
oversold my expertise but we'll do what
 
04:51:41.350 --> 04:51:41.360 align:start position:0%
we can um so we are not necessarily in
 
04:51:43.390 --> 04:51:43.400 align:start position:0%
support or opposed to this bill but we
 
04:51:46.230 --> 04:51:46.240 align:start position:0%
have concerns and the concerns are
 
04:51:49.350 --> 04:51:49.360 align:start position:0%
that as a business owner um you are
 
04:51:51.190 --> 04:51:51.200 align:start position:0%
required to comply with both state and
 
04:51:53.990 --> 04:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
federal regulations and currently the
 
04:51:56.510 --> 04:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
way the the statute is written for the
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
under 16 youth um we already have a a
 
04:52:01.788 --> 04:52:01.798 align:start position:0%
conflict in here right so right now in
 
04:52:03.990 --> 04:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire statute no earlier
 
04:52:06.030 --> 04:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
than 7:00 a.m. and no later than 9:00
 
04:52:08.430 --> 04:52:08.440 align:start position:0%
p.m. the federal standard is you can't
 
04:52:10.788 --> 04:52:10.798 align:start position:0%
work past 7:00 p.m. and I can't tell you
 
04:52:12.868 --> 04:52:12.878 align:start position:0%
how many business owners I know who get
 
04:52:15.510 --> 04:52:15.520 align:start position:0%
and to paraphrase Representatives
 
04:52:18.070 --> 04:52:18.080 align:start position:0%
offering of my testimony earlier uh a
 
04:52:20.430 --> 04:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
gotcha because now they have a two-hour
 
04:52:22.390 --> 04:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
window that New Hampshire Department of
 
04:52:24.270 --> 04:52:24.280 align:start position:0%
Labor tells them sure by Statute you're
 
04:52:27.190 --> 04:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
fine but under the US Federal audit you
 
04:52:28.948 --> 04:52:28.958 align:start position:0%
are not fine and then you see in the
 
04:52:31.390 --> 04:52:31.400 align:start position:0%
paper as I'm sure you all have we have
 
04:52:33.150 --> 04:52:33.160 align:start position:0%
all these youth labor violations well a
 
04:52:34.670 --> 04:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
big part of that is because there's
 
04:52:37.230 --> 04:52:37.240 align:start position:0%
discrepancies between state and federal
 
04:52:39.190 --> 04:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
so what I would re certainly request of
 
04:52:40.830 --> 04:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
this committee is to take a hard look at
 
04:52:42.788 --> 04:52:42.798 align:start position:0%
what the federal standard is and try to
 
04:52:45.110 --> 04:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
align our standard with that standard
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
because we don't want to get in these
 
04:52:48.628 --> 04:52:48.638 align:start position:0%
situations where businesses are trying
 
04:52:50.270 --> 04:52:50.280 align:start position:0%
to meet two different standards and
 
04:52:51.590 --> 04:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
depending on if you're a new business
 
04:52:53.230 --> 04:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
owner you're a veteran you may or may
 
04:52:54.788 --> 04:52:54.798 align:start position:0%
not know what the rules are and
 
04:52:56.230 --> 04:52:56.240 align:start position:0%
depending on who you talk to you get a
 
04:52:57.830 --> 04:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
different answer to what the rules are
 
04:52:59.628 --> 04:52:59.638 align:start position:0%
and so that creates a lot of conflict so
 
04:53:02.788 --> 04:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
would certainly um request that you take
 
04:53:06.510 --> 04:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
a look at that for example in on line um
 
04:53:08.910 --> 04:53:08.920 align:start position:0%
lines four and five it strikes out more
 
04:53:10.868 --> 04:53:10.878 align:start position:0%
than 3 hours per day on school days and
 
04:53:13.830 --> 04:53:13.840 align:start position:0%
23 hours per uh week during school weeks
 
04:53:16.470 --> 04:53:16.480 align:start position:0%
that's the federal standard so that has
 
04:53:18.670 --> 04:53:18.680 align:start position:0%
to stay in because that is is the way it
 
04:53:21.230 --> 04:53:21.240 align:start position:0%
has to has to operate the the other
 
04:53:23.190 --> 04:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
comment I'll make and you you guys had a
 
04:53:24.788 --> 04:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
very robust discussion but the other
 
04:53:26.590 --> 04:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
thing I'll comment I'll make is that
 
04:53:28.110 --> 04:53:28.120 align:start position:0%
this statute is permissive for the
 
04:53:29.628 --> 04:53:29.638 align:start position:0%
business owner right this doesn't affect
 
04:53:31.470 --> 04:53:31.480 align:start position:0%
school schedules or anything else I
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
think what the department is essentially
 
04:53:35.270 --> 04:53:35.280 align:start position:0%
trying to get that is they have no other
 
04:53:37.910 --> 04:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
standard for homeschooled kids so they
 
04:53:39.868 --> 04:53:39.878 align:start position:0%
so they have to default to whatever
 
04:53:41.628 --> 04:53:41.638 align:start position:0%
standard is in that locality which would
 
04:53:45.070 --> 04:53:45.080 align:start position:0%
be the school schedule so um you know is
 
04:53:46.628 --> 04:53:46.638 align:start position:0%
there a way to provide greater
 
04:53:49.910 --> 04:53:49.920 align:start position:0%
flexibility within the statute for that
 
04:53:51.868 --> 04:53:51.878 align:start position:0%
perhaps um I'm certainly not an expert
 
04:53:54.868 --> 04:53:54.878 align:start position:0%
in it but um but I just I caution the
 
04:53:57.670 --> 04:53:57.680 align:start position:0%
committee in going too far in in uh
 
04:53:59.470 --> 04:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
trampling all over the standard between
 
04:54:00.670 --> 04:54:00.680 align:start position:0%
state and federal because that's going
 
04:54:02.190 --> 04:54:02.200 align:start position:0%
to create huge issues for the industry
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
to try to comply with and we'll get back
 
04:54:06.070 --> 04:54:06.080 align:start position:0%
to the standard representative cworth
 
04:54:07.830 --> 04:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
you were here a couple years ago when we
 
04:54:10.190 --> 04:54:10.200 align:start position:0%
fixed the 16 and 17 year olds to 35
 
04:54:12.868 --> 04:54:12.878 align:start position:0%
hours a week and took out that massive
 
04:54:15.750 --> 04:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
sliding chart that was just a nightmare
 
04:54:19.150 --> 04:54:19.160 align:start position:0%
nobody used it so um so I'll end with
 
04:54:20.470 --> 04:54:20.480 align:start position:0%
that and I'm happy to try to answer any
 
04:54:23.910 --> 04:54:23.920 align:start position:0%
questions all right thank you any
 
04:54:26.548 --> 04:54:26.558 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:54:28.910 --> 04:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
C going be a little bit of a
 
04:54:32.750 --> 04:54:32.760 align:start position:0%
plug so um following up on your comments
 
04:54:35.110 --> 04:54:35.120 align:start position:0%
about this not being in conformance with
 
04:54:37.948 --> 04:54:37.958 align:start position:0%
the federal standards uh would there be
 
04:54:40.030 --> 04:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
a difference
 
04:54:42.948 --> 04:54:42.958 align:start position:0%
with um the bills we're trying to pass
 
04:54:45.230 --> 04:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
with marijuana in the workforce and that
 
04:54:48.030 --> 04:54:48.040 align:start position:0%
that's that's actually not authorized by
 
04:54:50.510 --> 04:54:50.520 align:start position:0%
the federal government but we're seeing
 
04:54:52.310 --> 04:54:52.320 align:start position:0%
that that's okay but this would be
 
04:54:54.670 --> 04:54:54.680 align:start position:0%
handled differently is is there
 
04:54:56.150 --> 04:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
correlation between the two I'm no
 
04:54:58.470 --> 04:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
expert in this subject matter but I will
 
04:55:01.270 --> 04:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
say that uh alcohol is regulated by the
 
04:55:03.788 --> 04:55:03.798 align:start position:0%
states or is deferred to the states um
 
04:55:05.628 --> 04:55:05.638 align:start position:0%
so I think there are certain areas where
 
04:55:07.868 --> 04:55:07.878 align:start position:0%
the states uh have their own right and I
 
04:55:09.590 --> 04:55:09.600 align:start position:0%
would also say that in the labor rules
 
04:55:11.190 --> 04:55:11.200 align:start position:0%
the state has the ability to set their
 
04:55:14.110 --> 04:55:14.120 align:start position:0%
own standards the problem for the imple
 
04:55:15.708 --> 04:55:15.718 align:start position:0%
the implementation of it at the business
 
04:55:17.430 --> 04:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
level the operator level is because you
 
04:55:18.948 --> 04:55:18.958 align:start position:0%
now have two standards that you have to
 
04:55:21.070 --> 04:55:21.080 align:start position:0%
comply with and then knowing which is
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
the most restrictive that you have to
 
04:55:26.070 --> 04:55:26.080 align:start position:0%
comply with that creates the
 
04:55:28.350 --> 04:55:28.360 align:start position:0%
challenge I'm sorry did I say alcohol or
 
04:55:31.230 --> 04:55:31.240 align:start position:0%
did I say marijuana I was using it as an
 
04:55:33.548 --> 04:55:33.558 align:start position:0%
example if you believe it was it was was
 
04:55:34.948 --> 04:55:34.958 align:start position:0%
the marijuana that's still against
 
04:55:38.270 --> 04:55:38.280 align:start position:0%
federal law right I'm not arguing the
 
04:55:38.280 --> 04:55:40.110 align:start position:0%
federal law right I'm not arguing the
point

04:55:40.110 --> 04:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
point
 
04:55:42.750 --> 04:55:42.760 align:start position:0%
no for other
 
04:55:44.868 --> 04:55:44.878 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
04:55:47.868 --> 04:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you uh feel free to not
 
04:55:50.750 --> 04:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
answer if you don't know um I'm not
 
04:55:52.030 --> 04:55:52.040 align:start position:0%
going to hold you to it I love making
 
04:55:57.070 --> 04:55:57.080 align:start position:0%
stuff up okay um do is it okay right now
 
04:55:59.310 --> 04:55:59.320 align:start position:0%
for a business to hire a homeschooler to
 
04:56:01.990 --> 04:56:02.000 align:start position:0%
work during public school hours where
 
04:56:04.310 --> 04:56:04.320 align:start position:0%
that homeschooler isn't actually
 
04:56:06.948 --> 04:56:06.958 align:start position:0%
doing any homeschool work uh that was
 
04:56:10.230 --> 04:56:10.240 align:start position:0%
asked of of the department was around um
 
04:56:12.190 --> 04:56:12.200 align:start position:0%
uh you know work experience type uh
 
04:56:14.190 --> 04:56:14.200 align:start position:0%
activities and there is a whole
 
04:56:16.190 --> 04:56:16.200 align:start position:0%
certification and verification process a
 
04:56:18.030 --> 04:56:18.040 align:start position:0%
business has to go through there are
 
04:56:21.670 --> 04:56:21.680 align:start position:0%
there are rigid um uh guard rails on a
 
04:56:23.430 --> 04:56:23.440 align:start position:0%
reporting mechanism from the business
 
04:56:25.350 --> 04:56:25.360 align:start position:0%
back to the school so it's a little bit
 
04:56:27.948 --> 04:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
different than just working a shift so
 
04:56:30.190 --> 04:56:30.200 align:start position:0%
um but as to whether or not a
 
04:56:32.708 --> 04:56:32.718 align:start position:0%
homeschooled student can work during uh
 
04:56:33.868 --> 04:56:33.878 align:start position:0%
school hour
 
04:56:35.830 --> 04:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
I I I don't want to pretend that I know
 
04:56:38.750 --> 04:56:38.760 align:start position:0%
the answer to that I do not thank you
 
04:56:41.470 --> 04:56:41.480 align:start position:0%
further questions representative kahill
 
04:56:43.110 --> 04:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you Mr
 
04:56:45.390 --> 04:56:45.400 align:start position:0%
Summers so would you would you feel
 
04:56:46.830 --> 04:56:46.840 align:start position:0%
comfortable in saying that businesses
 
04:56:49.350 --> 04:56:49.360 align:start position:0%
find it easier when the laws are
 
04:56:51.390 --> 04:56:51.400 align:start position:0%
consistent is that what I'm
 
04:56:55.750 --> 04:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
getting yes thank you representative
 
04:56:59.868 --> 04:56:59.878 align:start position:0%
St um thank you um in this um sixth
 
04:57:04.948 --> 04:57:04.958 align:start position:0%
paragraph it says that um
 
04:57:07.948 --> 04:57:07.958 align:start position:0%
uh 16 and 17 year olds who are enrolled
 
04:57:10.270 --> 04:57:10.280 align:start position:0%
in school shall work no more than 35
 
04:57:14.470 --> 04:57:14.480 align:start position:0%
hours during that work week um but then
 
04:57:16.708 --> 04:57:16.718 align:start position:0%
it says that unless a youth's required
 
04:57:18.948 --> 04:57:18.958 align:start position:0%
attendance while in school is less than
 
04:57:20.990 --> 04:57:21.000 align:start position:0%
35 hours per week in which case the
 
04:57:23.190 --> 04:57:23.200 align:start position:0%
youth shall be permitted to work at any
 
04:57:25.390 --> 04:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
time the youth is not required to attend
 
04:57:28.708 --> 04:57:28.718 align:start position:0%
school and up here it says that 48 hours
 
04:57:32.830 --> 04:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
is the limit on um during vacations and
 
04:57:37.750 --> 04:57:37.760 align:start position:0%
um so are those numbers the 48h hour top
 
04:57:42.150 --> 04:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
number for um youth or younger persons
 
04:57:44.910 --> 04:57:44.920 align:start position:0%
in uh 35 hours per week during school
 
04:57:47.110 --> 04:57:47.120 align:start position:0%
sessions are those also Federal numbers
 
04:57:50.350 --> 04:57:50.360 align:start position:0%
or are we again
 
04:57:53.830 --> 04:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
um not again I would encourage you to
 
04:57:55.910 --> 04:57:55.920 align:start position:0%
double check that with uh people smarter
 
04:57:58.430 --> 04:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
than I but I will say that you know the
 
04:58:00.708 --> 04:58:00.718 align:start position:0%
top section is for under 16 the lower
 
04:58:03.708 --> 04:58:03.718 align:start position:0%
section is for um 1617
 
04:58:05.510 --> 04:58:05.520 align:start position:0%
at the federal level 16 and 177 there
 
04:58:07.670 --> 04:58:07.680 align:start position:0%
are no restrictions you're essentially
 
04:58:10.350 --> 04:58:10.360 align:start position:0%
an adult um it's the under 16 where it
 
04:58:12.110 --> 04:58:12.120 align:start position:0%
gets a little bit uh slippery but I
 
04:58:15.430 --> 04:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
believe I believe that the 48 hours is
 
04:58:18.190 --> 04:58:18.200 align:start position:0%
uh accurate for uh during their outside
 
04:58:19.990 --> 04:58:20.000 align:start position:0%
the school year um if they're working
 
04:58:21.788 --> 04:58:21.798 align:start position:0%
those hours Etc but I believe that
 
04:58:23.590 --> 04:58:23.600 align:start position:0%
aligns but I would I would encourage you
 
04:58:26.390 --> 04:58:26.400 align:start position:0%
to double check that and and it I know
 
04:58:29.430 --> 04:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
some of it is in section 7 which wasn't
 
04:58:31.310 --> 04:58:31.320 align:start position:0%
included in the bill language but it's
 
04:58:34.430 --> 04:58:34.440 align:start position:0%
the next one down that talks about this
 
04:58:37.910 --> 04:58:37.920 align:start position:0%
the vacation time versus school time and
 
04:58:40.030 --> 04:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
there is somewhere else and I do not
 
04:58:42.830 --> 04:58:42.840 align:start position:0%
remember where it is where there's a
 
04:58:47.750 --> 04:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
overall Pro uh upper limit for under 18s
 
04:58:51.948 --> 04:58:51.958 align:start position:0%
and it it depends on the industry so all
 
04:58:55.270 --> 04:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
of this stuff aside in another section
 
04:58:58.270 --> 04:58:58.280 align:start position:0%
it falls back on an absolute cap so it
 
04:59:01.030 --> 04:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
gets difficult sometimes to try to
 
04:59:03.948 --> 04:59:03.958 align:start position:0%
take one piece and
 
04:59:10.750 --> 04:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:13.548 --> 04:59:13.558 align:start position:0%
it any other
 
04:59:15.708 --> 04:59:15.718 align:start position:0%

04:59:21.030 --> 04:59:21.040 align:start position:0%
and uh I think everybody fled the room
 
04:59:22.628 --> 04:59:22.638 align:start position:0%
with that but if there's anyone else who
 
04:59:27.830 --> 04:59:27.840 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak please um say so
 
04:59:30.948 --> 04:59:30.958 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh the sign in sheets on its
 
04:59:30.958 --> 04:59:32.030 align:start position:0%
otherwise uh the sign in sheets on its
way

04:59:32.030 --> 04:59:32.040 align:start position:0%
way
 
04:59:32.040 --> 04:59:42.470 align:start position:0%
way
up

04:59:42.470 --> 04:59:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:45.830 --> 04:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
so which one's this so on that bill no
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
one signed in and on um the previous
 
04:59:53.230 --> 04:59:53.240 align:start position:0%
Bill no one signed in so with that I
 
04:59:58.150 --> 04:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
will close the hearing on HB 159 and we
 
05:00:00.990 --> 05:00:01.000 align:start position:0%
will be in recess until 300 p.m. when
 
05:00:13.830 --> 05:00:13.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:31.910 --> 05:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:31.920 --> 05:13:57.390 align:start position:0%
 
person

05:13:57.390 --> 05:13:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:59.270 --> 05:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
so if everyone could uh take their seats
 
05:14:00.788 --> 05:14:00.798 align:start position:0%
and get ready for the next hearing I'd
 
05:14:11.350 --> 05:14:11.360 align:start position:0%

05:14:49.750 --> 05:14:49.760 align:start position:0%
impressed my son who's 10 years old is
 
05:14:51.350 --> 05:14:51.360 align:start position:0%
when I showed him there's a YouTube
 
05:14:53.948 --> 05:14:53.958 align:start position:0%
channel that I'm on YouTube for It's

you did read it
 
05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
1375 the first one the first one I read
 
05:15:40.430 --> 05:15:40.440 align:start position:0%
was the um Severance agreements and I
 
05:15:43.628 --> 05:15:43.638 align:start position:0%
just I had both sheets both blue sheets
 
05:15:45.230 --> 05:15:45.240 align:start position:0%
that's why I read them both and then the
 
05:15:50.310 --> 05:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
1519 was the work hours for
 
05:15:53.390 --> 05:15:53.400 align:start position:0%
youth these were as of 8:25 this morning
 
05:15:57.110 --> 05:15:57.120 align:start position:0%
so they were you know confused what am I
 
05:16:00.510 --> 05:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
missing 1522 I didn't say we said it
 
05:16:00.520 --> 05:16:02.390 align:start position:0%
missing 1522 I didn't say we said it
earlier

05:16:02.390 --> 05:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
05:16:06.230 --> 05:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
we have oh you said that I did
 
05:16:09.310 --> 05:16:09.320 align:start position:0%
he realized that we can still
 
05:16:11.990 --> 05:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
accept you can do it till midnight so
 
05:16:17.510 --> 05:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:22.150 --> 05:16:22.160 align:start position:0%
room I did it was 28 to zero that sounds
 
05:16:26.990 --> 05:16:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:29.510 --> 05:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
one I'm going to open the hearing on
 
05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill 1648
 
05:16:35.548 --> 05:16:35.558 align:start position:0%
point of order Mr Mr chair point of
 
05:16:39.548 --> 05:16:39.558 align:start position:0%
order in my left hand I have
 
05:16:45.150 --> 05:16:45.160 align:start position:0%
HB uh 1648 19 or from 2024 in my right
 
05:16:49.390 --> 05:16:49.400 align:start position:0%
hand I have S SP 46 from
 
05:16:53.070 --> 05:16:53.080 align:start position:0%
2023 these bills are nearly identical
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
and by my knowledge that's a violation
 
05:16:59.270 --> 05:16:59.280 align:start position:0%
of house rules to do the same bill in
 
05:17:01.990 --> 05:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
succeeding years of the same term um
 
05:17:04.628 --> 05:17:04.638 align:start position:0%
what's up with
 
05:17:07.350 --> 05:17:07.360 align:start position:0%
this while I have not spoken directly
 
05:17:08.830 --> 05:17:08.840 align:start position:0%
with the speaker it is my understanding
 
05:17:12.030 --> 05:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
that the um off uh the legislative
 
05:17:13.948 --> 05:17:13.958 align:start position:0%
Services did not want
 
05:17:13.958 --> 05:17:15.470 align:start position:0%
Services did not want
to

05:17:15.470 --> 05:17:15.480 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:17:18.350 --> 05:17:18.360 align:start position:0%
um draft the bill for that very same
 
05:17:21.270 --> 05:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
reason a um request of the speaker was
 
05:17:23.110 --> 05:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
made to overrule that request and that
 
05:17:23.120 --> 05:17:25.190 align:start position:0%
made to overrule that request and that
was

05:17:25.190 --> 05:17:25.200 align:start position:0%
was
 
05:17:28.830 --> 05:17:28.840 align:start position:0%
provided I have similar thoughts I guess
 
05:17:30.510 --> 05:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
my suggestion would be since we've heard
 
05:17:32.070 --> 05:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
05:17:34.788 --> 05:17:34.798 align:start position:0%
by this uh committee there's probably no
 
05:17:39.788 --> 05:17:39.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:39.798 --> 05:17:41.470 align:start position:0%
 
again

05:17:41.470 --> 05:17:41.480 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:17:47.110 --> 05:17:47.120 align:start position:0%
um the speaker uh made a um overruled
 
05:17:49.548 --> 05:17:49.558 align:start position:0%
legislative services and allowed the
 
05:17:51.948 --> 05:17:51.958 align:start position:0%
bill to be heard uh allowed the bill to
 
05:17:55.070 --> 05:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
be drafted the bill uh was given to me
 
05:17:58.708 --> 05:17:58.718 align:start position:0%
uh I have to hear it fair enough the
 
05:18:02.430 --> 05:18:02.440 align:start position:0%
last point I'll make is that uh s SP 46
 
05:18:02.440 --> 05:18:03.510 align:start position:0%
last point I'll make is that uh s SP 46
in

05:18:03.510 --> 05:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:18:09.030 --> 05:18:09.040 align:start position:0%
2023 um from the committee was itl 20 to
 
05:18:16.868 --> 05:18:16.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:19.750 --> 05:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
you going to call Representative uh
 
05:18:24.830 --> 05:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:26.990 --> 05:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you welcome to the labor
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chairman and
 
05:18:30.910 --> 05:18:30.920 align:start position:0%
thank you members of the committee for
 
05:18:33.190 --> 05:18:33.200 align:start position:0%
uh for hearing my testimony by way of
 
05:18:35.990 --> 05:18:36.000 align:start position:0%
introduction my name is Jim kofalt I
 
05:18:38.548 --> 05:18:38.558 align:start position:0%
represent Hillsboro County District 32
 
05:18:40.750 --> 05:18:40.760 align:start position:0%
which is comprised the towns of Wilton
 
05:18:43.070 --> 05:18:43.080 align:start position:0%
Temple and new
 
05:18:46.990 --> 05:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
ipswitch um so House Bill 1648 attempts
 
05:18:49.230 --> 05:18:49.240 align:start position:0%
to clarify the uh the procedures by
 
05:18:51.788 --> 05:18:51.798 align:start position:0%
which employees could be paid using an
 
05:18:54.390 --> 05:18:54.400 align:start position:0%
electronic debit card and I guess I will
 
05:18:57.708 --> 05:18:57.718 align:start position:0%
Begin by um addressing the concern uh
 
05:18:59.868 --> 05:18:59.878 align:start position:0%
that was raised a few moments ago uh
 
05:19:01.868 --> 05:19:01.878 align:start position:0%
because there are C certainly quite a
 
05:19:04.548 --> 05:19:04.558 align:start position:0%
few similarities between this and Senate
 
05:19:07.470 --> 05:19:07.480 align:start position:0%
Bill 46 there was some back and forth
 
05:19:10.510 --> 05:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
discussion with OS and the speaker's
 
05:19:13.150 --> 05:19:13.160 align:start position:0%
office and um ultimately it was
 
05:19:15.310 --> 05:19:15.320 align:start position:0%
determined that the the changes that
 
05:19:18.150 --> 05:19:18.160 align:start position:0%
were introduced into this bill uh were
 
05:19:20.548 --> 05:19:20.558 align:start position:0%
were material to the extent that it is
 
05:19:23.670 --> 05:19:23.680 align:start position:0%
not exactly the same bill and therefore
 
05:19:25.948 --> 05:19:25.958 align:start position:0%
is was was deemed permissible by the
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
speaker's office so so I guess I will I
 
05:19:31.628 --> 05:19:31.638 align:start position:0%
I will I will go directly to the
 
05:19:33.150 --> 05:19:33.160 align:start position:0%
specific changes because I think there
 
05:19:34.990 --> 05:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
were some concerns that were
 
05:19:38.110 --> 05:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
raised last year with Senate Bill
 
05:19:41.868 --> 05:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
46 um you know one of which was would an
 
05:19:45.510 --> 05:19:45.520 align:start position:0%
employee potentially be responsible for
 
05:19:48.270 --> 05:19:48.280 align:start position:0%
uh fees uh this bill affirmatively
 
05:19:50.270 --> 05:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
asserts that employees would not be
 
05:19:52.670 --> 05:19:52.680 align:start position:0%
responsible for for fees associated with
 
05:19:57.788 --> 05:19:57.798 align:start position:0%
a lost or stolen card um and it also uh
 
05:20:00.990 --> 05:20:01.000 align:start position:0%
asserts that uh funds would be available
 
05:20:02.910 --> 05:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
uh there would be a number of free
 
05:20:07.070 --> 05:20:07.080 align:start position:0%
resources uh where employees could um
 
05:20:08.590 --> 05:20:08.600 align:start position:0%
could use the debit cards or could
 
05:20:13.270 --> 05:20:13.280 align:start position:0%
withdraw cash from uh most ATM machines
 
05:20:16.030 --> 05:20:16.040 align:start position:0%
um but the bill this version of the bill
 
05:20:18.110 --> 05:20:18.120 align:start position:0%
also stipulates that the employer would
 
05:20:21.430 --> 05:20:21.440 align:start position:0%
be required to provide a list of uh such
 
05:20:25.230 --> 05:20:25.240 align:start position:0%
locations to uh to the employees um
 
05:20:27.310 --> 05:20:27.320 align:start position:0%
finally I know that there was a concern
 
05:20:29.430 --> 05:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
about collective bargaining agreements
 
05:20:32.270 --> 05:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
and whether or not this would um
 
05:20:34.990 --> 05:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
supersede the rights of of unions to uh
 
05:20:36.948 --> 05:20:36.958 align:start position:0%
to negotiate the method of payment with
 
05:20:41.270 --> 05:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
their uh with their employers and again
 
05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
uh the current version of the bill
 
05:20:47.830 --> 05:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
specifically um excludes uh unions
 
05:20:50.750 --> 05:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
protects union workers uh in that
 
05:20:54.310 --> 05:20:54.320 align:start position:0%
scenario um so I've sort of covered the
 
05:20:57.470 --> 05:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
the the latter part of my uh of my bill
 
05:20:59.868 --> 05:20:59.878 align:start position:0%
introduction first uh I guess for the
 
05:21:03.310 --> 05:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
sake of of uh completeness I'll just say
 
05:21:04.948 --> 05:21:04.958 align:start position:0%
that I think that in you know we live in
 
05:21:06.750 --> 05:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
a world right now where payments by and
 
05:21:09.708 --> 05:21:09.718 align:start position:0%
large are electronic uh paper checks are
 
05:21:14.270 --> 05:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
an element of that um but or an element
 
05:21:17.190 --> 05:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
of of the way we do business uh but but
 
05:21:20.230 --> 05:21:20.240 align:start position:0%
in today's world payments happen by a
 
05:21:22.788 --> 05:21:22.798 align:start position:0%
large electronically uh payer checks are
 
05:21:24.750 --> 05:21:24.760 align:start position:0%
very slow and inefficient by
 
05:21:27.390 --> 05:21:27.400 align:start position:0%
comparison um electronic debit cards I
 
05:21:30.310 --> 05:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
would argue actually give employees
 
05:21:31.708 --> 05:21:31.718 align:start position:0%
particularly employ employees who do
 
05:21:33.788 --> 05:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
don't have access to a bank account with
 
05:21:36.868 --> 05:21:36.878 align:start position:0%
a direct deposit uh a faster easier and
 
05:21:39.270 --> 05:21:39.280 align:start position:0%
more flexible way of accessing their
 
05:21:42.910 --> 05:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
funds um so having said that I think
 
05:21:44.788 --> 05:21:44.798 align:start position:0%
that the bill before you does address
 
05:21:47.110 --> 05:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
some of the concerns that were noted as
 
05:21:48.868 --> 05:21:48.878 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in Senate Bill
 
05:21:52.270 --> 05:21:52.280 align:start position:0%
46 um and I would urge you to uh to
 
05:21:55.110 --> 05:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
consider this bill
 
05:21:58.030 --> 05:21:58.040 align:start position:0%
um and consider consider voting ought to
 
05:22:00.510 --> 05:22:00.520 align:start position:0%
pass on this bill that concludes my
 
05:22:00.520 --> 05:22:01.948 align:start position:0%
pass on this bill that concludes my
introduction

05:22:01.948 --> 05:22:01.958 align:start position:0%
introduction
 
05:22:07.310 --> 05:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:09.270 --> 05:22:09.280 align:start position:0%
questions I don't know which one you put
 
05:22:09.280 --> 05:22:10.948 align:start position:0%
questions I don't know which one you put
up

05:22:10.948 --> 05:22:10.958 align:start position:0%
up
 
05:22:10.958 --> 05:22:12.788 align:start position:0%
up
first

05:22:12.788 --> 05:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
first
 
05:22:15.628 --> 05:22:15.638 align:start position:0%
sorry Granger followed by uh grego
 
05:22:20.430 --> 05:22:20.440 align:start position:0%
followed by thank you Mr chair um so is
 
05:22:25.628 --> 05:22:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:28.788 --> 05:22:28.798 align:start position:0%
cards um I will leave it for for others
 
05:22:31.628 --> 05:22:31.638 align:start position:0%
to uh to provide a definitive answer to
 
05:22:33.750 --> 05:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
that but my understanding is that you
 
05:22:35.708 --> 05:22:35.718 align:start position:0%
know our our current law does not
 
05:22:39.390 --> 05:22:39.400 align:start position:0%
provide for it so it would be a problema
 
05:22:41.990 --> 05:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
problematic scenario would you believe
 
05:22:43.990 --> 05:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
that I've received payment with a
 
05:22:46.070 --> 05:22:46.080 align:start position:0%
payroll card in New
 
05:22:48.750 --> 05:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that comes as as a surprise to
 
05:22:53.430 --> 05:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:56.070 --> 05:22:56.080 align:start position:0%
youo thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:22:58.470 --> 05:22:58.480 align:start position:0%
taking my question on
 
05:23:04.070 --> 05:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
line 16 says uh employee well starting
 
05:23:06.270 --> 05:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
on line 15 employee is unable to access
 
05:23:08.830 --> 05:23:08.840 align:start position:0%
page oh sorry
 
05:23:12.350 --> 05:23:12.360 align:start position:0%
page one two three well actually yeah
 
05:23:14.788 --> 05:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
technically it's the first
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
page it says if an employee is unable to
 
05:23:20.548 --> 05:23:20.558 align:start position:0%
access their wages due a tech due to a
 
05:23:23.430 --> 05:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
technical or processing defect can you
 
05:23:25.670 --> 05:23:25.680 align:start position:0%
describe what a technical or a
 
05:23:28.788 --> 05:23:28.798 align:start position:0%
processing defect is um I imagine that a
 
05:23:31.310 --> 05:23:31.320 align:start position:0%
card with a bad mag stripe or otherwise
 
05:23:34.948 --> 05:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
unreadable might be one example of a uh
 
05:23:36.708 --> 05:23:36.718 align:start position:0%
a technical problem that would prevent
 
05:23:39.150 --> 05:23:39.160 align:start position:0%
the an employee from Gaining access to
 
05:23:43.230 --> 05:23:43.240 align:start position:0%
their funds okay follow up follow up so
 
05:23:47.390 --> 05:23:47.400 align:start position:0%
then on lines 21 and 22 on the same page
 
05:23:49.310 --> 05:23:49.320 align:start position:0%
um actually starting on line 20 says if
 
05:23:51.070 --> 05:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
an employee debit card is lost stolen
 
05:23:53.070 --> 05:23:53.080 align:start position:0%
damaged such that the funds are no
 
05:23:54.948 --> 05:23:54.958 align:start position:0%
longer accessible to the employee the
 
05:23:56.590 --> 05:23:56.600 align:start position:0%
employer shall provide the employee with
 
05:23:59.070 --> 05:23:59.080 align:start position:0%
a replacement employee debit card within
 
05:24:02.190 --> 05:24:02.200 align:start position:0%
24 hours of being notified
 
05:24:05.230 --> 05:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
so is the intent of this bill now that
 
05:24:07.750 --> 05:24:07.760 align:start position:0%
we know the technical or processing
 
05:24:10.510 --> 05:24:10.520 align:start position:0%
defect is not the fault of the employer
 
05:24:13.030 --> 05:24:13.040 align:start position:0%
but actually probably the manufacturer
 
05:24:14.470 --> 05:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
and the fact that a card was lost or
 
05:24:17.430 --> 05:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
stolen is also not because of the
 
05:24:19.548 --> 05:24:19.558 align:start position:0%
employer's wrongdoing it's all because
 
05:24:20.868 --> 05:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
of the employee or somebody else that's
 
05:24:21.788 --> 05:24:21.798 align:start position:0%
out of their
 
05:24:24.350 --> 05:24:24.360 align:start position:0%
control is the intent of this bill to
 
05:24:25.910 --> 05:24:25.920 align:start position:0%
punish the employer and have them come
 
05:24:28.030 --> 05:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
back on a weekend when they're away to
 
05:24:30.030 --> 05:24:30.040 align:start position:0%
pay the employee on time because that's
 
05:24:31.510 --> 05:24:31.520 align:start position:0%
how this bill's written
 
05:24:33.910 --> 05:24:33.920 align:start position:0%
well I think the the intention of the
 
05:24:37.150 --> 05:24:37.160 align:start position:0%
bill is to provide some additional
 
05:24:40.510 --> 05:24:40.520 align:start position:0%
flexibility uh paper check checks can be
 
05:24:42.868 --> 05:24:42.878 align:start position:0%
inconvenient and costly both for the
 
05:24:45.030 --> 05:24:45.040 align:start position:0%
employee and the employer there's
 
05:24:46.470 --> 05:24:46.480 align:start position:0%
nothing in this bill that precludes an
 
05:24:49.628 --> 05:24:49.638 align:start position:0%
employer from continuing to to pay by
 
05:24:51.190 --> 05:24:51.200 align:start position:0%
papercheck if they
 
05:24:51.200 --> 05:24:53.548 align:start position:0%
papercheck if they
choose

05:24:53.548 --> 05:24:53.558 align:start position:0%
choose
 
05:24:56.310 --> 05:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
um the the concerns that were raised the
 
05:24:58.628 --> 05:24:58.638 align:start position:0%
last time this bill came up were we want
 
05:25:00.270 --> 05:25:00.280 align:start position:0%
to make sure that people have access to
 
05:25:01.868 --> 05:25:01.878 align:start position:0%
their funds
 
05:25:03.910 --> 05:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
um and that that would be promptly
 
05:25:06.510 --> 05:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
replaced so if that is something that
 
05:25:08.110 --> 05:25:08.120 align:start position:0%
that the committee believes needs to be
 
05:25:09.590 --> 05:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
tightened up then I would be happy to
 
05:25:12.110 --> 05:25:12.120 align:start position:0%
work with uh with any members of the
 
05:25:14.868 --> 05:25:14.878 align:start position:0%
committee who are who are willing to uh
 
05:25:16.868 --> 05:25:16.878 align:start position:0%
to work on an amendment to to come up
 
05:25:19.390 --> 05:25:19.400 align:start position:0%
with a solution to that
 
05:25:21.830 --> 05:25:21.840 align:start position:0%
problem thank
 
05:25:25.110 --> 05:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
you have aani followed by
 
05:25:28.788 --> 05:25:28.798 align:start position:0%
Sullivan um okay Brian uh he's yielded
 
05:25:32.510 --> 05:25:32.520 align:start position:0%
to you thank you um just uh addressing
 
05:25:35.070 --> 05:25:35.080 align:start position:0%
representative Granger's uh question if
 
05:25:36.390 --> 05:25:36.400 align:start position:0%
you look at the
 
05:25:41.350 --> 05:25:41.360 align:start position:0%
bill there are methods a b c and d d
 
05:25:43.788 --> 05:25:43.798 align:start position:0%
currently is the payroll card so it is
 
05:25:46.430 --> 05:25:46.440 align:start position:0%
not illegal to use a payroll card now
 
05:25:48.230 --> 05:25:48.240 align:start position:0%
what this bill does is it allows an
 
05:25:51.430 --> 05:25:51.440 align:start position:0%
employer to eliminate the paper check
 
05:25:53.868 --> 05:25:53.878 align:start position:0%
and uh require someone to use the
 
05:25:56.070 --> 05:25:56.080 align:start position:0%
payroll card so it's illegal to require
 
05:25:58.390 --> 05:25:58.400 align:start position:0%
someone to use a payroll card right now
 
05:26:00.270 --> 05:26:00.280 align:start position:0%
but it's not illegal to pay through
 
05:26:00.280 --> 05:26:01.430 align:start position:0%
but it's not illegal to pay through
payroll

05:26:01.430 --> 05:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
payroll
 
05:26:03.788 --> 05:26:03.798 align:start position:0%
card it's also my understanding
 
05:26:06.150 --> 05:26:06.160 align:start position:0%
representative aani thank you Mr
 
05:26:09.190 --> 05:26:09.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you representative calt
 
05:26:11.708 --> 05:26:11.718 align:start position:0%
um aside from uh representative Drago's
 
05:26:12.948 --> 05:26:12.958 align:start position:0%
questions uh this is forcing the
 
05:26:15.470 --> 05:26:15.480 align:start position:0%
employer to technically pay an employee
 
05:26:18.548 --> 05:26:18.558 align:start position:0%
twice if they're unable to access their
 
05:26:20.510 --> 05:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
funds with either through a processing
 
05:26:22.830 --> 05:26:22.840 align:start position:0%
defect or that their card is
 
05:26:25.590 --> 05:26:25.600 align:start position:0%
gone um is that the intent as well is to
 
05:26:26.868 --> 05:26:26.878 align:start position:0%
double pay an employee because they
 
05:26:28.510 --> 05:26:28.520 align:start position:0%
can't access their
 
05:26:32.708 --> 05:26:32.718 align:start position:0%
funds no the the intent would be to uh
 
05:26:35.750 --> 05:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
would be to ensure that the employee has
 
05:26:38.750 --> 05:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
access to the funds if the employer
 
05:26:41.990 --> 05:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
chooses electronic payment card as a
 
05:26:43.990 --> 05:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
method of payment there's nothing in
 
05:26:45.788 --> 05:26:45.798 align:start position:0%
this bill that says that an employer has
 
05:26:47.548 --> 05:26:47.558 align:start position:0%
to choose that as a method of payment
 
05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
they can continue to issue paper checks
 
05:26:54.030 --> 05:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
um they can according to line eight they
 
05:26:56.230 --> 05:26:56.240 align:start position:0%
can pay it in cash presumably with
 
05:26:59.390 --> 05:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
lawful money in the United States so um
 
05:27:01.430 --> 05:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
it is it it
 
05:27:04.788 --> 05:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
is codifying one
 
05:27:07.270 --> 05:27:07.280 align:start position:0%
additional option that an employer would
 
05:27:09.990 --> 05:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
have so if an employer chooses not to
 
05:27:11.590 --> 05:27:11.600 align:start position:0%
because they have the kinds of concerns
 
05:27:13.830 --> 05:27:13.840 align:start position:0%
that have been raised there um then by
 
05:27:15.670 --> 05:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
all means they they would not be
 
05:27:20.430 --> 05:27:20.440 align:start position:0%
required to do so um what this what this
 
05:27:21.868 --> 05:27:21.878 align:start position:0%
would do is it would protect the
 
05:27:24.708 --> 05:27:24.718 align:start position:0%
employees in the event that they have
 
05:27:27.150 --> 05:27:27.160 align:start position:0%
for some reason are unable to access
 
05:27:29.230 --> 05:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
their funds the employer would be
 
05:27:31.628 --> 05:27:31.638 align:start position:0%
required to make sure that they can can
 
05:27:34.070 --> 05:27:34.080 align:start position:0%
replace that lost or stolen or defective
 
05:27:35.990 --> 05:27:36.000 align:start position:0%
card within 24
 
05:27:39.670 --> 05:27:39.680 align:start position:0%
hours clarification um if you have
 
05:27:41.270 --> 05:27:41.280 align:start position:0%
questions about like because I also have
 
05:27:43.548 --> 05:27:43.558 align:start position:0%
the same questions about protocol you
 
05:27:45.590 --> 05:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
lose it what happens new card how the
 
05:27:47.390 --> 05:27:47.400 align:start position:0%
other one gets deactivated the funds
 
05:27:49.150 --> 05:27:49.160 align:start position:0%
whatever um there's someone from ADP
 
05:27:50.948 --> 05:27:50.958 align:start position:0%
that's going to be speaking afterwards
 
05:27:53.390 --> 05:27:53.400 align:start position:0%
so maybe other than the representative
 
05:27:56.750 --> 05:27:56.760 align:start position:0%
that those questions on technical stuff
 
05:27:58.430 --> 05:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
I would ask you to wait till the next
 
05:28:00.110 --> 05:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
speaker but you're welcome to ask any
 
05:28:03.110 --> 05:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
other question questions you have I just
 
05:28:04.230 --> 05:28:04.240 align:start position:0%
because this this is again this is the
 
05:28:05.590 --> 05:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
same bill we've seen before and this is
 
05:28:07.030 --> 05:28:07.040 align:start position:0%
the same issue that I have come up with
 
05:28:09.270 --> 05:28:09.280 align:start position:0%
lines 15 through 18 you're forcing the
 
05:28:11.470 --> 05:28:11.480 align:start position:0%
employer to re with the intelligence of
 
05:28:13.990 --> 05:28:14.000 align:start position:0%
the chair forcing the employer to repay
 
05:28:15.708 --> 05:28:15.718 align:start position:0%
that employee if they got paid on Friday
 
05:28:17.708 --> 05:28:17.718 align:start position:0%
their cards not good on Saturday this is
 
05:28:19.310 --> 05:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
telling me as an employer I shall
 
05:28:21.230 --> 05:28:21.240 align:start position:0%
immediately pay them till they get their
 
05:28:23.150 --> 05:28:23.160 align:start position:0%
new card or replace their card in 24
 
05:28:25.590 --> 05:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
hours now I know the ADP is not open
 
05:28:28.948 --> 05:28:28.958 align:start position:0%
24/7 so if I'm using ADP as an example
 
05:28:29.868 --> 05:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
they're they're not going to get a
 
05:28:31.708 --> 05:28:31.718 align:start position:0%
replacement card till Monday so I'm on
 
05:28:33.590 --> 05:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
the hook for paying that employee twice
 
05:28:35.310 --> 05:28:35.320 align:start position:0%
before that card is active and how do I
 
05:28:37.390 --> 05:28:37.400 align:start position:0%
recoup the payment if I've paid them
 
05:28:39.430 --> 05:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
twice because this is forcing me to
 
05:28:42.030 --> 05:28:42.040 align:start position:0%
between lines 15 and 18 thank you thank
 
05:28:45.110 --> 05:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
you for the question so again I I will
 
05:28:46.788 --> 05:28:46.798 align:start position:0%
uh in in keeping with the Chairman's
 
05:28:48.628 --> 05:28:48.638 align:start position:0%
comment I will say I think that there
 
05:28:50.430 --> 05:28:50.440 align:start position:0%
are others who can probably speak to the
 
05:28:53.070 --> 05:28:53.080 align:start position:0%
mechanics of it more accurately than I
 
05:28:57.350 --> 05:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
can um having said that if you're
 
05:28:59.470 --> 05:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
issuing a a card and that card is
 
05:29:02.548 --> 05:29:02.558 align:start position:0%
subsequently lost or stolen just as you
 
05:29:04.910 --> 05:29:04.920 align:start position:0%
can cancel a credit card or cancel a
 
05:29:07.430 --> 05:29:07.440 align:start position:0%
debit card uh the idea here is you would
 
05:29:12.150 --> 05:29:12.160 align:start position:0%
be able to cancel the uh the use of the
 
05:29:15.270 --> 05:29:15.280 align:start position:0%
um of the electronic payment card that
 
05:29:17.750 --> 05:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
has just been reported lost or stolen in
 
05:29:19.350 --> 05:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
the case of paper checks there is a
 
05:29:21.910 --> 05:29:21.920 align:start position:0%
similar process uh in which there has to
 
05:29:23.830 --> 05:29:23.840 align:start position:0%
be a stop payment issued and stop
 
05:29:26.788 --> 05:29:26.798 align:start position:0%
payments cost a lot of money uh but
 
05:29:29.590 --> 05:29:29.600 align:start position:0%
without them there is a risk that
 
05:29:31.230 --> 05:29:31.240 align:start position:0%
somebody somewhere picks up that check
 
05:29:35.270 --> 05:29:35.280 align:start position:0%
and manages to to cash it so um it's
 
05:29:37.070 --> 05:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
actually in some respects I believe a
 
05:29:39.670 --> 05:29:39.680 align:start position:0%
safer means of of ensuring that
 
05:29:41.990 --> 05:29:42.000 align:start position:0%
everybody walks away whole thank you Mr
 
05:29:44.670 --> 05:29:44.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:49.868 --> 05:29:49.878 align:start position:0%
you repr Broody thank you Mr chairman um
 
05:29:51.030 --> 05:29:51.040 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
05:29:53.750 --> 05:29:53.760 align:start position:0%
about lost to stolen cards or a
 
05:29:56.830 --> 05:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
defective card if this went through
 
05:30:00.310 --> 05:30:00.320 align:start position:0%
would you be opposed to most employers
 
05:30:03.070 --> 05:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
will pay you withhold a week's pay like
 
05:30:05.150 --> 05:30:05.160 align:start position:0%
you work all week and you get paid the
 
05:30:07.350 --> 05:30:07.360 align:start position:0%
next Friday or the next Thursday would
 
05:30:09.548 --> 05:30:09.558 align:start position:0%
you be opposed to anybody who chooses
 
05:30:12.030 --> 05:30:12.040 align:start position:0%
this to be paid by
 
05:30:15.390 --> 05:30:15.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesday of the next
 
05:30:18.628 --> 05:30:18.638 align:start position:0%
week I think we would have to explore
 
05:30:20.590 --> 05:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
that it sounds to me like it might
 
05:30:22.350 --> 05:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
complicate things the current law has
 
05:30:25.110 --> 05:30:25.120 align:start position:0%
one one standard as far as the timing of
 
05:30:29.270 --> 05:30:29.280 align:start position:0%
payments relative to work completed um
 
05:30:31.910 --> 05:30:31.920 align:start position:0%
and it seems seems to me that it would
 
05:30:34.750 --> 05:30:34.760 align:start position:0%
somewhat complicate things if we were to
 
05:30:36.670 --> 05:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
um create different standards for
 
05:30:39.590 --> 05:30:39.600 align:start position:0%
different payment methods but I
 
05:30:42.270 --> 05:30:42.280 align:start position:0%
certainly would be open to
 
05:30:45.070 --> 05:30:45.080 align:start position:0%
discussion representative kahill thank
 
05:30:46.708 --> 05:30:46.718 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:30:49.548 --> 05:30:49.558 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question uh
 
05:30:51.470 --> 05:30:51.480 align:start position:0%
you referenced earlier you wanted to
 
05:30:51.480 --> 05:30:52.708 align:start position:0%
you referenced earlier you wanted to
improve

05:30:52.708 --> 05:30:52.718 align:start position:0%
improve
 
05:30:54.708 --> 05:30:54.718 align:start position:0%
flexibility but I'm afraid that the
 
05:30:58.390 --> 05:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
flexibility for the employee is is uh is
 
05:31:01.150 --> 05:31:01.160 align:start position:0%
reduced if their preferen is to a paper
 
05:31:04.310 --> 05:31:04.320 align:start position:0%
check and that's that's no longer an
 
05:31:06.548 --> 05:31:06.558 align:start position:0%
option here it's replaced with the uh
 
05:31:09.590 --> 05:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
payroll card which for many people is
 
05:31:12.190 --> 05:31:12.200 align:start position:0%
problematic uh fees and all the sort of
 
05:31:15.150 --> 05:31:15.160 align:start position:0%
thing and as as we've learned from my
 
05:31:18.190 --> 05:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
colleague Mr Granger payroll cards are
 
05:31:20.910 --> 05:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
being used now and I imagine if he had a
 
05:31:22.510 --> 05:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
difficulty he would make another
 
05:31:25.788 --> 05:31:25.798 align:start position:0%
Arrangement but if this law was to pass
 
05:31:29.070 --> 05:31:29.080 align:start position:0%
he could not choose a paper check if if
 
05:31:30.830 --> 05:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
that if this was removed moved do you
 
05:31:32.430 --> 05:31:32.440 align:start position:0%
see a conflict
 
05:31:32.440 --> 05:31:34.708 align:start position:0%
see a conflict
here

05:31:34.708 --> 05:31:34.718 align:start position:0%
here
 
05:31:38.670 --> 05:31:38.680 align:start position:0%
um I I actually don't because I believe
 
05:31:40.310 --> 05:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
and and again this is my opinion it's
 
05:31:41.788 --> 05:31:41.798 align:start position:0%
not necessarily going to be everybody's
 
05:31:43.830 --> 05:31:43.840 align:start position:0%
opinion but I think we've all seen
 
05:31:45.590 --> 05:31:45.600 align:start position:0%
scenarios where it's Friday afternoon
 
05:31:47.350 --> 05:31:47.360 align:start position:0%
and everybody's rushing down to the bank
 
05:31:51.470 --> 05:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
before it closes to cash their check um
 
05:31:53.670 --> 05:31:53.680 align:start position:0%
with electronic payment cards you
 
05:31:55.070 --> 05:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
actually don't have to go to the bank
 
05:31:58.390 --> 05:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
you can go to an ATM 24/7 anytime and
 
05:32:01.390 --> 05:32:01.400 align:start position:0%
withdraw money without paying a fee um
 
05:32:04.470 --> 05:32:04.480 align:start position:0%
and have cash at your fingertips having
 
05:32:06.708 --> 05:32:06.718 align:start position:0%
said that I think if the committee deems
 
05:32:10.150 --> 05:32:10.160 align:start position:0%
it important to protect
 
05:32:13.190 --> 05:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
somebody's option to still get a paper
 
05:32:15.788 --> 05:32:15.798 align:start position:0%
check I think that that's something that
 
05:32:17.788 --> 05:32:17.798 align:start position:0%
again we could discuss in an amendment
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
and see how we could come to a a an
 
05:32:23.390 --> 05:32:23.400 align:start position:0%
agreement on on what that would look
 
05:32:25.948 --> 05:32:25.958 align:start position:0%
like solve that problem follow up follow
 
05:32:29.150 --> 05:32:29.160 align:start position:0%
up uh so as we talked earlier the the
 
05:32:31.270 --> 05:32:31.280 align:start position:0%
payroll check is the payroll check is an
 
05:32:34.030 --> 05:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
option payroll cards are an option so if
 
05:32:37.030 --> 05:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
we leave it as it is now we we needn't
 
05:32:39.948 --> 05:32:39.958 align:start position:0%
worry but when someone goes and uses
 
05:32:43.030 --> 05:32:43.040 align:start position:0%
their payroll debit card uh isn't there
 
05:32:45.510 --> 05:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
like withdrawal it is isn't just one
 
05:32:47.430 --> 05:32:47.440 align:start position:0%
withdrawal and then after that there's a
 
05:32:50.788 --> 05:32:50.798 align:start position:0%
fee and isn't and aren't the debit card
 
05:32:54.110 --> 05:32:54.120 align:start position:0%
companies making fees incurring uh
 
05:32:56.670 --> 05:32:56.680 align:start position:0%
profits from the more people using these
 
05:32:59.390 --> 05:32:59.400 align:start position:0%
cards uh generally speaking the fees if
 
05:33:02.510 --> 05:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
you use it debit card at a merchant um
 
05:33:04.830 --> 05:33:04.840 align:start position:0%
the merchant is paying fees so if I go
 
05:33:06.830 --> 05:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
into Home Depot and I use a credit card
 
05:33:09.548 --> 05:33:09.558 align:start position:0%
or a debit card um I'm not paying a
 
05:33:12.708 --> 05:33:12.718 align:start position:0%
markup on the product that I'm buying um
 
05:33:15.510 --> 05:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
there is a a small percentage and
 
05:33:18.390 --> 05:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
usually a flat fee of something like a
 
05:33:20.470 --> 05:33:20.480 align:start position:0%
quarter uh in addition to that per
 
05:33:22.190 --> 05:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
transaction that is charged to the
 
05:33:25.350 --> 05:33:25.360 align:start position:0%
merchant by the credit card
 
05:33:28.270 --> 05:33:28.280 align:start position:0%
processor um as a consumer I don't pay
 
05:33:32.350 --> 05:33:32.360 align:start position:0%
that um like wise one of the concerns
 
05:33:35.670 --> 05:33:35.680 align:start position:0%
here uh with with the Senate Bill uh
 
05:33:39.590 --> 05:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
that was very similar was um was this
 
05:33:41.708 --> 05:33:41.718 align:start position:0%
idea that if I go to an ATM machine I'm
 
05:33:44.948 --> 05:33:44.958 align:start position:0%
going to be charged a fee in fact um
 
05:33:48.150 --> 05:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
they virtually any ATM machine that
 
05:33:52.788 --> 05:33:52.798 align:start position:0%
accepts Visa and MasterCard um would be
 
05:33:54.830 --> 05:33:54.840 align:start position:0%
would be usable to withdraw funds from
 
05:33:57.990 --> 05:33:58.000 align:start position:0%
this and in this version of the bill it
 
05:33:59.948 --> 05:33:59.958 align:start position:0%
would be required that the employer Prov
 
05:34:02.948 --> 05:34:02.958 align:start position:0%
provide a list of such locations to the
 
05:34:05.430 --> 05:34:05.440 align:start position:0%
employee so that they could withdraw
 
05:34:09.430 --> 05:34:09.440 align:start position:0%
funds without a fee so um so there are
 
05:34:12.390 --> 05:34:12.400 align:start position:0%
no built-in fees for for employees in
 
05:34:13.628 --> 05:34:13.638 align:start position:0%
using these
 
05:34:17.510 --> 05:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
cards follow up so
 
05:34:20.910 --> 05:34:20.920 align:start position:0%
the the merchant pays the fees for the
 
05:34:22.910 --> 05:34:22.920 align:start position:0%
convenience of of having the transaction
 
05:34:25.470 --> 05:34:25.480 align:start position:0%
use the pay but doesn't the merchant
 
05:34:27.190 --> 05:34:27.200 align:start position:0%
have to pass those fees on to the
 
05:34:29.830 --> 05:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
consumer or you know if he simply absorb
 
05:34:32.030 --> 05:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
ABS them uh you're hurting the small
 
05:34:34.310 --> 05:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
business operator aren't you
 
05:34:37.910 --> 05:34:37.920 align:start position:0%
um ask a question okay would you
 
05:34:41.390 --> 05:34:41.400 align:start position:0%
believe that I I find it ask a question
 
05:34:44.670 --> 05:34:44.680 align:start position:0%
that could be answered by the T are are
 
05:34:47.470 --> 05:34:47.480 align:start position:0%
the fees like if you were here last week
 
05:34:50.948 --> 05:34:50.958 align:start position:0%
you would have heard uh Mr veu speaking
 
05:34:53.470 --> 05:34:53.480 align:start position:0%
that we that people when they use credit
 
05:34:55.750 --> 05:34:55.760 align:start position:0%
cards with the restaurants there's
 
05:34:58.628 --> 05:34:58.638 align:start position:0%
there's a markup I think rough 3% or
 
05:35:01.190 --> 05:35:01.200 align:start position:0%
four 4% that the restaurants are have to
 
05:35:04.430 --> 05:35:04.440 align:start position:0%
absorb and pass on and isn't it likely
 
05:35:06.750 --> 05:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
that if people weren't using cards with
 
05:35:08.990 --> 05:35:09.000 align:start position:0%
the frequency that they're encouraged to
 
05:35:11.350 --> 05:35:11.360 align:start position:0%
we might have lower prices when we go
 
05:35:14.990 --> 05:35:15.000 align:start position:0%
out to eat or or buy something in the
 
05:35:15.000 --> 05:35:17.190 align:start position:0%
out to eat or or buy something in the
store

05:35:17.190 --> 05:35:17.200 align:start position:0%
store
 
05:35:20.310 --> 05:35:20.320 align:start position:0%
um it's hard to disagree with that but I
 
05:35:22.830 --> 05:35:22.840 align:start position:0%
but I also tend to believe that payment
 
05:35:26.350 --> 05:35:26.360 align:start position:0%
using payment cards is not going to
 
05:35:29.150 --> 05:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
um is is not going to statistically
 
05:35:30.868 --> 05:35:30.878 align:start position:0%
change the the the volume of
 
05:35:33.708 --> 05:35:33.718 align:start position:0%
transactions that we're running through
 
05:35:36.270 --> 05:35:36.280 align:start position:0%
payment cards I I will tell you that
 
05:35:40.070 --> 05:35:40.080 align:start position:0%
personally I very seldom pay in cash I
 
05:35:42.270 --> 05:35:42.280 align:start position:0%
buy almost everything with a payment
 
05:35:45.230 --> 05:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
card and it's something that Merchants
 
05:35:47.070 --> 05:35:47.080 align:start position:0%
build into the cost of doing business as
 
05:35:51.470 --> 05:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:53.990 --> 05:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
followup uh in the case of your own
 
05:35:56.868 --> 05:35:56.878 align:start position:0%
personal credit card uh are you being
 
05:35:58.750 --> 05:35:58.760 align:start position:0%
rewarded you know incentivized by the
 
05:36:00.390 --> 05:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
credit card company would that be the
 
05:36:02.030 --> 05:36:02.040 align:start position:0%
case with a payroll
 
05:36:05.150 --> 05:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
card in fact there are uh some
 
05:36:07.390 --> 05:36:07.400 align:start position:0%
incentives available using some of these
 
05:36:11.430 --> 05:36:11.440 align:start position:0%
cards I will let the the next speaker uh
 
05:36:13.310 --> 05:36:13.320 align:start position:0%
address that question but my
 
05:36:14.948 --> 05:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
understanding that is that yes employees
 
05:36:16.628 --> 05:36:16.638 align:start position:0%
would actually have access to some of
 
05:36:20.430 --> 05:36:20.440 align:start position:0%
those kinds of um points programs that
 
05:36:22.548 --> 05:36:22.558 align:start position:0%
might benefit them if they use a card
 
05:36:25.190 --> 05:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
over the long term thank you
 
05:36:28.788 --> 05:36:28.798 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chairman
 
05:36:30.948 --> 05:36:30.958 align:start position:0%
if you can indulge me a little to kind
 
05:36:33.350 --> 05:36:33.360 align:start position:0%
of um piggyback on on what
 
05:36:35.548 --> 05:36:35.558 align:start position:0%
representative kahill is talking about
 
05:36:38.350 --> 05:36:38.360 align:start position:0%
uh with regard to the payroll card if I
 
05:36:39.990 --> 05:36:40.000 align:start position:0%
was to use that in the cafeteria
 
05:36:42.230 --> 05:36:42.240 align:start position:0%
downstairs in the State Building there's
 
05:36:43.590 --> 05:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
a sign in that says that I'm going to be
 
05:36:46.390 --> 05:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
charged a 4% transaction fee so am I
 
05:36:48.670 --> 05:36:48.680 align:start position:0%
then being charged 4% to use my own
 
05:36:51.230 --> 05:36:51.240 align:start position:0%
payroll because it's given to me on a
 
05:36:54.230 --> 05:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
card in in the rare instance that you
 
05:36:56.670 --> 05:36:56.680 align:start position:0%
have a merchant who's charging you a a
 
05:36:59.270 --> 05:36:59.280 align:start position:0%
fee for using a payment card yes that
 
05:37:01.670 --> 05:37:01.680 align:start position:0%
would be the case um under those
 
05:37:03.548 --> 05:37:03.558 align:start position:0%
circumstances like say you could pay
 
05:37:06.750 --> 05:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
cash you could go to an ATM machine one
 
05:37:08.310 --> 05:37:08.320 align:start position:0%
to one of the many ATM machines where
 
05:37:10.430 --> 05:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
you could withdraw funds for free and
 
05:37:11.788 --> 05:37:11.798 align:start position:0%
pay cash without incurring that
 
05:37:11.798 --> 05:37:13.110 align:start position:0%
pay cash without incurring that
additional

05:37:13.110 --> 05:37:13.120 align:start position:0%
additional
 
05:37:16.350 --> 05:37:16.360 align:start position:0%
cost follow so I guess that would be the
 
05:37:18.150 --> 05:37:18.160 align:start position:0%
point right because then it's not
 
05:37:20.910 --> 05:37:20.920 align:start position:0%
treated as cash so if I'm not able to
 
05:37:23.628 --> 05:37:23.638 align:start position:0%
get to an ATM card I mean an ATM machine
 
05:37:26.110 --> 05:37:26.120 align:start position:0%
to take cash out to pay for my
 
05:37:29.270 --> 05:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
lunch this is not being handled the same
 
05:37:32.190 --> 05:37:32.200 align:start position:0%
way as cash then so now I'm being forced
 
05:37:34.510 --> 05:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
to into another path which actually does
 
05:37:37.070 --> 05:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
cause more it does incur more expense on
 
05:37:39.868 --> 05:37:39.878 align:start position:0%
my part to to be fair if the alternative
 
05:37:41.670 --> 05:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
is that you're taking a paper check to a
 
05:37:44.070 --> 05:37:44.080 align:start position:0%
bank then you're also being forced to
 
05:37:45.830 --> 05:37:45.840 align:start position:0%
what I would argue is an even more
 
05:37:49.430 --> 05:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
inconvenient path to spend your
 
05:37:54.230 --> 05:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.788 --> 05:37:56.798 align:start position:0%
Mason thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:37:58.868 --> 05:37:58.878 align:start position:0%
taking my question um could you
 
05:38:00.590 --> 05:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
elaborate just a little bit on the ATM
 
05:38:03.310 --> 05:38:03.320 align:start position:0%
machines because in the past I've my
 
05:38:05.270 --> 05:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
businesses have owned some ATM
 
05:38:08.110 --> 05:38:08.120 align:start position:0%
machines the fees come to the owners of
 
05:38:11.430 --> 05:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
the ATM machines so these aren't all ATM
 
05:38:13.350 --> 05:38:13.360 align:start position:0%
machines they're not private Banking ATM
 
05:38:15.628 --> 05:38:15.638 align:start position:0%
machines they're ATM machines owned by
 
05:38:18.990 --> 05:38:19.000 align:start position:0%
credit card company I I will defer to uh
 
05:38:22.628 --> 05:38:22.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:25.830 --> 05:38:25.840 align:start position:0%
me representative buard thank you Mr
 
05:38:28.548 --> 05:38:28.558 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
05:38:28.558 --> 05:38:30.270 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
question

05:38:30.270 --> 05:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
05:38:33.910 --> 05:38:33.920 align:start position:0%
um would you believe that um you can
 
05:38:38.310 --> 05:38:38.320 align:start position:0%
join a credit union for $5 and get free
 
05:38:38.320 --> 05:38:40.390 align:start position:0%
join a credit union for $5 and get free
checking

05:38:40.390 --> 05:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
checking
 
05:38:43.750 --> 05:38:43.760 align:start position:0%
account and that way you're eliminating
 
05:38:47.468 --> 05:38:47.478 align:start position:0%
the paper trail and everything is done
 
05:38:49.190 --> 05:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
electronically uh thank you for the
 
05:38:52.948 --> 05:38:52.958 align:start position:0%
question yes um I am proudly a member of
 
05:38:54.310 --> 05:38:54.320 align:start position:0%
One of New Hampshire's First Credit
 
05:38:57.708 --> 05:38:57.718 align:start position:0%
Unions first in the country I believe um
 
05:39:00.750 --> 05:39:00.760 align:start position:0%
and I that remains an option and it's
 
05:39:02.350 --> 05:39:02.360 align:start position:0%
something that quite honestly I would
 
05:39:04.110 --> 05:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
encourage people to do when my son was
 
05:39:05.868 --> 05:39:05.878 align:start position:0%
getting his first job I encouraged him
 
05:39:07.910 --> 05:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
to sign up for direct deposit because I
 
05:39:10.190 --> 05:39:10.200 align:start position:0%
think that's also a very efficient way
 
05:39:14.230 --> 05:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
of managing your money and uh what I was
 
05:39:16.910 --> 05:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
concerned with him about was that he
 
05:39:19.830 --> 05:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
would put his paper check somewhere lose
 
05:39:23.670 --> 05:39:23.680 align:start position:0%
it forget to cash it and have to clean
 
05:39:26.708 --> 05:39:26.718 align:start position:0%
that mess up years later or months later
 
05:39:29.868 --> 05:39:29.878 align:start position:0%
so um so in fact I think that uh that
 
05:39:31.468 --> 05:39:31.478 align:start position:0%
that is another very good option for
 
05:39:33.910 --> 05:39:33.920 align:start position:0%
people who are looking for an efficient
 
05:39:36.910 --> 05:39:36.920 align:start position:0%
electronic means of getting
 
05:39:39.150 --> 05:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
paid representative
 
05:39:41.788 --> 05:39:41.798 align:start position:0%
ccum thank you again Mr chairman I'm
 
05:39:43.390 --> 05:39:43.400 align:start position:0%
going to get off of this subject and
 
05:39:45.590 --> 05:39:45.600 align:start position:0%
move on to something different on page
 
05:39:49.910 --> 05:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
one line 10 um I see that it states by
 
05:39:51.788 --> 05:39:51.798 align:start position:0%
direct deposit we used it currently
 
05:39:53.430 --> 05:39:53.440 align:start position:0%
states by direct deposit with written
 
05:39:55.390 --> 05:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
authorization of the employee to the
 
05:39:58.070 --> 05:39:58.080 align:start position:0%
banks can you explain why uh you've
 
05:40:00.070 --> 05:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
struck out the with written consent to
 
05:40:01.310 --> 05:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
the employee and I've noticed in a
 
05:40:03.350 --> 05:40:03.360 align:start position:0%
couple of areas we seem to have taken
 
05:40:05.430 --> 05:40:05.440 align:start position:0%
out the written consent of the employee
 
05:40:08.310 --> 05:40:08.320 align:start position:0%
so what would be the reasoning behind
 
05:40:11.350 --> 05:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
that um I am afraid I don't have a good
 
05:40:14.670 --> 05:40:14.680 align:start position:0%
answer to that I will I will revert to
 
05:40:16.910 --> 05:40:16.920 align:start position:0%
OS and and figure out why that was
 
05:40:22.390 --> 05:40:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:28.320 --> 05:40:31.110 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:40:31.110 --> 05:40:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:40:33.750 --> 05:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
well personally I agree
 
05:40:36.110 --> 05:40:36.120 align:start position:0%
that um direct
 
05:40:39.628 --> 05:40:39.638 align:start position:0%
deposit provides immediate access you
 
05:40:41.150 --> 05:40:41.160 align:start position:0%
don't have to worry about losing a check
 
05:40:44.750 --> 05:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
some of these other things it is rare in
 
05:40:44.760 --> 05:40:45.468 align:start position:0%
some of these other things it is rare in
this

05:40:45.468 --> 05:40:45.478 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:40:49.110 --> 05:40:49.120 align:start position:0%
committee to actually mandate employees
 
05:40:49.120 --> 05:40:50.030 align:start position:0%
committee to actually mandate employees
do

05:40:50.030 --> 05:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:40:54.670 --> 05:40:54.680 align:start position:0%
something what is the what is the
 
05:40:54.680 --> 05:40:56.468 align:start position:0%
something what is the what is the
underlying

05:40:56.468 --> 05:40:56.478 align:start position:0%
underlying
 
05:41:00.468 --> 05:41:00.478 align:start position:0%
need to force to require or
 
05:41:02.868 --> 05:41:02.878 align:start position:0%
mandate employers
 
05:41:05.910 --> 05:41:05.920 align:start position:0%
take something other than a check I.E in
 
05:41:08.948 --> 05:41:08.958 align:start position:0%
this case a bank
 
05:41:11.390 --> 05:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
card thank you for the question so I
 
05:41:15.670 --> 05:41:15.680 align:start position:0%
think um in framing this as a mandate I
 
05:41:18.430 --> 05:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
think the way it is written right now it
 
05:41:21.590 --> 05:41:21.600 align:start position:0%
it does in fact take paper checks off
 
05:41:24.788 --> 05:41:24.798 align:start position:0%
the table in other words a an
 
05:41:27.150 --> 05:41:27.160 align:start position:0%
employer certainly has the option of
 
05:41:30.310 --> 05:41:30.320 align:start position:0%
issuing paper checks but as this bill is
 
05:41:33.110 --> 05:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
written they would not be obligated to
 
05:41:35.628 --> 05:41:35.638 align:start position:0%
offer that option to their employees
 
05:41:37.390 --> 05:41:37.400 align:start position:0%
having said that I think if that is the
 
05:41:41.788 --> 05:41:41.798 align:start position:0%
sticking point then I I think we can we
 
05:41:43.468 --> 05:41:43.478 align:start position:0%
can talk about an amendment that would
 
05:41:46.548 --> 05:41:46.558 align:start position:0%
solve that particular problem the the
 
05:41:50.310 --> 05:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
issue here I think is opening up a a
 
05:41:52.430 --> 05:41:52.440 align:start position:0%
newer more modern form of electronic
 
05:41:55.468 --> 05:41:55.478 align:start position:0%
payment that is not provided for in law
 
05:42:00.030 --> 05:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
today and while I I respectfully
 
05:42:01.548 --> 05:42:01.558 align:start position:0%
appreciate the comment that somebody
 
05:42:03.590 --> 05:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
here has been paid with an electronic
 
05:42:07.030 --> 05:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
debit card um it is not clear to me that
 
05:42:10.390 --> 05:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
that is um that that is something that
 
05:42:13.670 --> 05:42:13.680 align:start position:0%
is supported in current statute so this
 
05:42:15.468 --> 05:42:15.478 align:start position:0%
would support it in current statute it
 
05:42:18.070 --> 05:42:18.080 align:start position:0%
would add a new capability and I guess
 
05:42:19.948 --> 05:42:19.958 align:start position:0%
that that that's how I see this as
 
05:42:22.788 --> 05:42:22.798 align:start position:0%
something that adds a new a new more
 
05:42:25.070 --> 05:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
efficient more flexible option for
 
05:42:25.080 --> 05:42:28.150 align:start position:0%
efficient more flexible option for
paying

05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:28.160 --> 05:42:35.110 align:start position:0%
 
employees

05:42:35.110 --> 05:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:38.070 --> 05:42:38.080 align:start position:0%
that is not the way we see the bill from
 
05:42:41.708 --> 05:42:41.718 align:start position:0%
what you said if you said and you want
 
05:42:44.030 --> 05:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
pay cards to be one of those other
 
05:42:48.350 --> 05:42:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:51.350 --> 05:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
here I don't think anyone would care
 
05:42:52.468 --> 05:42:52.478 align:start position:0%
maybe he's
 
05:42:54.548 --> 05:42:54.558 align:start position:0%
fine I don't think that's what your bill
 
05:42:57.708 --> 05:42:57.718 align:start position:0%
has done here and that's the the I know
 
05:42:59.868 --> 05:42:59.878 align:start position:0%
that's not a question I I think you just
 
05:43:01.230 --> 05:43:01.240 align:start position:0%
said something totally different from
 
05:43:04.590 --> 05:43:04.600 align:start position:0%
what what we are feeling so maybe we'll
 
05:43:08.750 --> 05:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:08.760 --> 05:43:11.390 align:start position:0%
 
testimony

05:43:11.390 --> 05:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
05:43:13.590 --> 05:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
represent I guess I will point out for a
 
05:43:13.600 --> 05:43:14.910 align:start position:0%
represent I guess I will point out for a
second

05:43:14.910 --> 05:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
second
 
05:43:18.110 --> 05:43:18.120 align:start position:0%
time payroll cards are presently an
 
05:43:20.430 --> 05:43:20.440 align:start position:0%
option for um employers this is not
 
05:43:23.788 --> 05:43:23.798 align:start position:0%
making them available for the first time
 
05:43:25.590 --> 05:43:25.600 align:start position:0%
under current
 
05:43:30.430 --> 05:43:30.440 align:start position:0%
law you've got uh Roman numeral I or one
 
05:43:35.350 --> 05:43:35.360 align:start position:0%
a b c and d current law buy a payroll
 
05:43:37.430 --> 05:43:37.440 align:start position:0%
card provided that the employer shall
 
05:43:39.868 --> 05:43:39.878 align:start position:0%
provide the employee at least one free
 
05:43:42.150 --> 05:43:42.160 align:start position:0%
means to withdraw up to the and
 
05:43:44.590 --> 05:43:44.600 align:start position:0%
including the full amount so essentially
 
05:43:46.150 --> 05:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
that is currently an
 
05:43:48.670 --> 05:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
option what this bill does is exactly
 
05:43:52.150 --> 05:43:52.160 align:start position:0%
what the chairman was uh indicating it
 
05:43:55.628 --> 05:43:55.638 align:start position:0%
continues to provide this option but it
 
05:43:58.030 --> 05:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
it eliminates the obligation to provide
 
05:43:59.750 --> 05:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
a papercheck
 
05:44:03.350 --> 05:44:03.360 align:start position:0%
and it allows an employer to force the
 
05:44:05.948 --> 05:44:05.958 align:start position:0%
employee to take a payroll card instead
 
05:44:09.548 --> 05:44:09.558 align:start position:0%
of that check that's what the bill
 
05:44:12.390 --> 05:44:12.400 align:start position:0%
does would you believe
 
05:44:14.350 --> 05:44:14.360 align:start position:0%
right we're going to get back to the
 
05:44:16.468 --> 05:44:16.478 align:start position:0%
questioning sorry we're just trying to
 
05:44:18.230 --> 05:44:18.240 align:start position:0%
have a little flexibility here in our
 
05:44:20.708 --> 05:44:20.718 align:start position:0%
conversation representative
 
05:44:24.150 --> 05:44:24.160 align:start position:0%
cul am I correct in understanding that
 
05:44:28.110 --> 05:44:28.120 align:start position:0%
it also removes the free means statement
 
05:44:30.670 --> 05:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
as well so it removes the ability for us
 
05:44:33.590 --> 05:44:33.600 align:start position:0%
to access our money for free um because
 
05:44:35.750 --> 05:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
those words have been struck from the
 
05:44:39.150 --> 05:44:39.160 align:start position:0%
the line okay um kind of get back to the
 
05:44:40.670 --> 05:44:40.680 align:start position:0%
way it should be um I'm not going to
 
05:44:42.708 --> 05:44:42.718 align:start position:0%
answer that question it's not I'm not
 
05:44:45.590 --> 05:44:45.600 align:start position:0%
testifying if you'd like to ask the um
 
05:44:47.350 --> 05:44:47.360 align:start position:0%
individual is testifying that question
 
05:44:48.750 --> 05:44:48.760 align:start position:0%
he can either answer that or wait for
 
05:44:51.548 --> 05:44:51.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:53.910 --> 05:44:53.920 align:start position:0%
I just trying to get back to the the
 
05:44:56.430 --> 05:44:56.440 align:start position:0%
protocol if that's all right and I'm the
 
05:44:57.830 --> 05:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
one that broke it so I know it's my
 
05:44:59.708 --> 05:44:59.718 align:start position:0%
fault my fault
 
05:45:02.110 --> 05:45:02.120 align:start position:0%
so any other questions for the
 
05:45:03.948 --> 05:45:03.958 align:start position:0%
representative seeing none thank you
 
05:45:07.670 --> 05:45:07.680 align:start position:0%

05:45:29.670 --> 05:45:29.680 align:start position:0%
Iceberg ADP
 
05:45:31.510 --> 05:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
welcome back to the labor
 
05:45:34.070 --> 05:45:34.080 align:start position:0%
committee thank you Mr chairman members
 
05:45:35.270 --> 05:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
of the committee we appreciate the
 
05:45:37.548 --> 05:45:37.558 align:start position:0%
opportunity to uh speak to you again
 
05:45:40.190 --> 05:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
about this uh topic we think it's very
 
05:45:42.190 --> 05:45:42.200 align:start position:0%
important uh and I understand there's
 
05:45:46.070 --> 05:45:46.080 align:start position:0%
some uh uh sensitivity here to U you
 
05:45:47.548 --> 05:45:47.558 align:start position:0%
know employee rights and so forth so
 
05:45:49.750 --> 05:45:49.760 align:start position:0%
I'll speak to that I think we are happy
 
05:45:51.510 --> 05:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
to uh to work with the committee on
 
05:45:53.350 --> 05:45:53.360 align:start position:0%
language that um you would find
 
05:45:55.750 --> 05:45:55.760 align:start position:0%
acceptable to move us closer to an
 
05:45:58.948 --> 05:45:58.958 align:start position:0%
environment in which um payroll could be
 
05:46:01.468 --> 05:46:01.478 align:start position:0%
uh administered as much as possible
 
05:46:04.510 --> 05:46:04.520 align:start position:0%
electronically so uh it may not be 100%
 
05:46:06.310 --> 05:46:06.320 align:start position:0%
for some time but um you know we'd like
 
05:46:09.270 --> 05:46:09.280 align:start position:0%
to move there um as best we can so again
 
05:46:11.230 --> 05:46:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh my name is Pete Iceberg I serve as
 
05:46:12.708 --> 05:46:12.718 align:start position:0%
vice president of government relations
 
05:46:15.390 --> 05:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
for ADP ADP is the one of the largest
 
05:46:18.390 --> 05:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
payroll companies in the nation we pay
 
05:46:21.310 --> 05:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
um roughly one of every six us
 
05:46:24.190 --> 05:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
workers and um really our our motivation
 
05:46:28.070 --> 05:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
in uh putting forth this bill is to help
 
05:46:29.548 --> 05:46:29.558 align:start position:0%
small businesses
 
05:46:31.390 --> 05:46:31.400 align:start position:0%
um and you know minimize their expenses
 
05:46:32.990 --> 05:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
and so forth it's very helpful for small
 
05:46:35.990 --> 05:46:36.000 align:start position:0%
businesses as at present um there's a a
 
05:46:38.230 --> 05:46:38.240 align:start position:0%
vast minority of employees that still
 
05:46:40.150 --> 05:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
are getting paper checks it's like 3 to
 
05:46:42.270 --> 05:46:42.280 align:start position:0%
5% of employees if you're a small
 
05:46:44.430 --> 05:46:44.440 align:start position:0%
business and um everything's running
 
05:46:46.070 --> 05:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
fairly smoothly electronically but you
 
05:46:47.868 --> 05:46:47.878 align:start position:0%
got one or two employees they're still
 
05:46:49.670 --> 05:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
getting paper checks it's it's very
 
05:46:52.830 --> 05:46:52.840 align:start position:0%
costly uh Bank of America did a study uh
 
05:46:54.830 --> 05:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
to the effect of um you know to
 
05:46:56.788 --> 05:46:56.798 align:start position:0%
administer paper checks including
 
05:47:00.270 --> 05:47:00.280 align:start position:0%
issuing U mailing reconciling sometimes
 
05:47:01.868 --> 05:47:01.878 align:start position:0%
stop payments and replacement things
 
05:47:04.868 --> 05:47:04.878 align:start position:0%
like that uh cost of fraud um paper
 
05:47:08.430 --> 05:47:08.440 align:start position:0%
checks are are very prone to fraud is
 
05:47:11.548 --> 05:47:11.558 align:start position:0%
about $4 up to $20 per check uh for
 
05:47:13.070 --> 05:47:13.080 align:start position:0%
small business who administer so this is
 
05:47:16.430 --> 05:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
kind of a s cost savings measure it also
 
05:47:17.910 --> 05:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
from our perspective very importantly
 
05:47:20.030 --> 05:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
helps employers to comply with the wage
 
05:47:21.590 --> 05:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
and hour
 
05:47:23.990 --> 05:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
laws and the issue there is that you
 
05:47:26.590 --> 05:47:26.600 align:start position:0%
know for some reason you know this bill
 
05:47:28.990 --> 05:47:29.000 align:start position:0%
um the wage and nrow laws have always
 
05:47:31.590 --> 05:47:31.600 align:start position:0%
made it a huge priority to pay employees
 
05:47:34.788 --> 05:47:34.798 align:start position:0%
on time and we totally agree with that
 
05:47:36.670 --> 05:47:36.680 align:start position:0%
um so this this actually helps employers
 
05:47:39.830 --> 05:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
to do that in contrast for example using
 
05:47:42.070 --> 05:47:42.080 align:start position:0%
a papercheck uh if an employee for
 
05:47:43.390 --> 05:47:43.400 align:start position:0%
whatever reason can't get to the
 
05:47:45.670 --> 05:47:45.680 align:start position:0%
workplace to pick up their check on
 
05:47:47.670 --> 05:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
payday maybe they're just sick that day
 
05:47:50.708 --> 05:47:50.718 align:start position:0%
maybe they're sick for a week um but
 
05:47:53.590 --> 05:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
somehow it's okay not to pay that person
 
05:47:55.510 --> 05:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
if they can't get to the workplace or
 
05:47:56.910 --> 05:47:56.920 align:start position:0%
they can't get to the bank or there's
 
05:47:58.708 --> 05:47:58.718 align:start position:0%
you know there's a snowstorm there's
 
05:48:00.548 --> 05:48:00.558 align:start position:0%
adverse weather for whatever reason if
 
05:48:03.510 --> 05:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
you can't deliver that paper check to a
 
05:48:05.868 --> 05:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
person somehow despite the strong wage
 
05:48:07.948 --> 05:48:07.958 align:start position:0%
and hour laws everybody's you know kind
 
05:48:09.868 --> 05:48:09.878 align:start position:0%
of like well you know can't help the
 
05:48:11.548 --> 05:48:11.558 align:start position:0%
weather uh you'll get paid next week
 
05:48:13.390 --> 05:48:13.400 align:start position:0%
sometime when when the US mail shows up
 
05:48:15.070 --> 05:48:15.080 align:start position:0%
we'll just mail your check that
 
05:48:17.468 --> 05:48:17.478 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be okay electronic pay
 
05:48:19.430 --> 05:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
resolves that issue you so even if
 
05:48:20.670 --> 05:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
there's a snowstorm bad weather you
 
05:48:21.788 --> 05:48:21.798 align:start position:0%
can't get to work you're sick you're on
 
05:48:23.990 --> 05:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
vacation whatever the the issue is you
 
05:48:25.468 --> 05:48:25.478 align:start position:0%
you don't have to get to the workplace
 
05:48:27.708 --> 05:48:27.718 align:start position:0%
to get that physical check and to take
 
05:48:29.110 --> 05:48:29.120 align:start position:0%
that uh to the
 
05:48:31.628 --> 05:48:31.638 align:start position:0%
Bank um and there was you know concerns
 
05:48:33.990 --> 05:48:34.000 align:start position:0%
about U the fees associated with this
 
05:48:35.310 --> 05:48:35.320 align:start position:0%
and really um if you're getting a
 
05:48:37.030 --> 05:48:37.040 align:start position:0%
payroll card you shouldn't have to pay
 
05:48:38.548 --> 05:48:38.558 align:start position:0%
any fees whatsoever you should be able
 
05:48:41.150 --> 05:48:41.160 align:start position:0%
to use that card anywhere you go you
 
05:48:42.910 --> 05:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
know pay just you know swipe your card
 
05:48:44.750 --> 05:48:44.760 align:start position:0%
to to spend the money or transfer the
 
05:48:47.548 --> 05:48:47.558 align:start position:0%
funds or however you spend uh your your
 
05:48:48.788 --> 05:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
your payroll
 
05:48:51.548 --> 05:48:51.558 align:start position:0%
dollars uh but the only way you're
 
05:48:52.910 --> 05:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
you're paying fees with these payroll
 
05:48:55.270 --> 05:48:55.280 align:start position:0%
cards if you if you're using an out of
 
05:48:58.708 --> 05:48:58.718 align:start position:0%
network ATM and again our our um you
 
05:49:00.468 --> 05:49:00.478 align:start position:0%
know the easy answer is you go to any
 
05:49:02.990 --> 05:49:03.000 align:start position:0%
Bank virtually any Bank uh in New
 
05:49:05.628 --> 05:49:05.638 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a Visa or MasterCard logo
 
05:49:07.390 --> 05:49:07.400 align:start position:0%
on the window and you show up on in a
 
05:49:09.230 --> 05:49:09.240 align:start position:0%
major bank with a Visa MasterCard logo
 
05:49:11.590 --> 05:49:11.600 align:start position:0%
on the window hand that card to any
 
05:49:13.070 --> 05:49:13.080 align:start position:0%
teller doesn't matter if you have an
 
05:49:14.948 --> 05:49:14.958 align:start position:0%
account there or not they're required to
 
05:49:16.910 --> 05:49:16.920 align:start position:0%
give you the full balance of that card
 
05:49:19.910 --> 05:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
without any fees or any part of it so
 
05:49:21.750 --> 05:49:21.760 align:start position:0%
just you know I'd like $200 off this
 
05:49:24.510 --> 05:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
card there's no fees for that so that's
 
05:49:25.868 --> 05:49:25.878 align:start position:0%
that's part of the agreement between the
 
05:49:28.230 --> 05:49:28.240 align:start position:0%
banks and MasterCard and Visa uh very
 
05:49:30.270 --> 05:49:30.280 align:start position:0%
protect detective of employees um
 
05:49:32.510 --> 05:49:32.520 align:start position:0%
there's also it it's very easy to find
 
05:49:34.590 --> 05:49:34.600 align:start position:0%
an in network Bank um I could show you
 
05:49:37.548 --> 05:49:37.558 align:start position:0%
on my um on my smartphone I bring up my
 
05:49:40.468 --> 05:49:40.478 align:start position:0%
uh payroll card app and just say where's
 
05:49:43.310 --> 05:49:43.320 align:start position:0%
the nearest um ATM and it'll give me a
 
05:49:47.310 --> 05:49:47.320 align:start position:0%
map within a half a mile of this office
 
05:49:51.788 --> 05:49:51.798 align:start position:0%
um of I think 29 locations U within a
 
05:49:53.910 --> 05:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
half mile that that where there's a a
 
05:49:56.830 --> 05:49:56.840 align:start position:0%
fee free ATM so anyway there's that
 
05:49:59.110 --> 05:49:59.120 align:start position:0%
that's fairly easy
 
05:50:01.430 --> 05:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
um you know we're we're just looking to
 
05:50:03.350 --> 05:50:03.360 align:start position:0%
um you know move as close as possible to
 
05:50:05.350 --> 05:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
electronic and I I won't belabor this
 
05:50:06.948 --> 05:50:06.958 align:start position:0%
too much more I think you understand
 
05:50:08.788 --> 05:50:08.798 align:start position:0%
this pretty well from the discussion I
 
05:50:10.230 --> 05:50:10.240 align:start position:0%
would love to entertain your your
 
05:50:11.788 --> 05:50:11.798 align:start position:0%
questions and and talk about this a
 
05:50:16.910 --> 05:50:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:19.910 --> 05:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
further representative Bui thank you Mr
 
05:50:22.628 --> 05:50:22.638 align:start position:0%
chair the hand uh you mentioned any a
 
05:50:24.708 --> 05:50:24.718 align:start position:0%
bank in New Hampshire what if you're out
 
05:50:27.510 --> 05:50:27.520 align:start position:0%
of state or out of the country uh can
 
05:50:29.750 --> 05:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
you go and get a balance say if I'm in
 
05:50:33.030 --> 05:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
Canada or Mexico or Greece or wherever
 
05:50:37.150 --> 05:50:37.160 align:start position:0%
right will they also be obliged to uh do
 
05:50:39.510 --> 05:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
that for free yeah I think US Banks any
 
05:50:41.110 --> 05:50:41.120 align:start position:0%
any Bank in the US with a Visa
 
05:50:43.030 --> 05:50:43.040 align:start position:0%
MasterCard logo on the window for all
 
05:50:44.750 --> 05:50:44.760 align:start position:0%
major Banks um that's that's free of
 
05:50:46.230 --> 05:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
charge even if you're out of state and
 
05:50:47.548 --> 05:50:47.558 align:start position:0%
that kind of thing if you're doing an
 
05:50:49.030 --> 05:50:49.040 align:start position:0%
international transaction there you're
 
05:50:50.628 --> 05:50:50.638 align:start position:0%
getting into some there are may be some
 
05:50:52.430 --> 05:50:52.440 align:start position:0%
fees for that for making an
 
05:50:54.310 --> 05:50:54.320 align:start position:0%
international transaction so that that's
 
05:50:55.830 --> 05:50:55.840 align:start position:0%
getting into kind of the banking fees
 
05:50:57.628 --> 05:50:57.638 align:start position:0%
but you know you look at this um you
 
05:50:59.590 --> 05:50:59.600 align:start position:0%
know what are what are people doing
 
05:51:01.070 --> 05:51:01.080 align:start position:0%
today that get a papercheck they're
 
05:51:02.430 --> 05:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
probably paying some fees to get that
 
05:51:04.230 --> 05:51:04.240 align:start position:0%
done as
 
05:51:08.590 --> 05:51:08.600 align:start position:0%
well okay follow thank you um so if if
 
05:51:10.548 --> 05:51:10.558 align:start position:0%
I'm out of the country and I'm using my
 
05:51:13.430 --> 05:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
debit card I don't get fees for
 
05:51:15.390 --> 05:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
that if you're out of the country and
 
05:51:16.990 --> 05:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
using a debit card there typically are
 
05:51:18.548 --> 05:51:18.558 align:start position:0%
international transaction fees
 
05:51:20.468 --> 05:51:20.478 align:start position:0%
associated with it so whether it's a
 
05:51:21.990 --> 05:51:22.000 align:start position:0%
payroll card or any other debit card
 
05:51:23.350 --> 05:51:23.360 align:start position:0%
there's typically International
 
05:51:23.360 --> 05:51:26.628 align:start position:0%
there's typically International
transaction

05:51:26.628 --> 05:51:26.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:29.510 --> 05:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
fees okay okay that's
 
05:51:32.390 --> 05:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
good repr
 
05:51:34.948 --> 05:51:34.958 align:start position:0%
drag thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
05:51:37.708 --> 05:51:37.718 align:start position:0%
taking my question did you just
 
05:51:39.430 --> 05:51:39.440 align:start position:0%
clarifying did you say roughly only
 
05:51:41.948 --> 05:51:41.958 align:start position:0%
three to four% of employers still pay by
 
05:51:45.310 --> 05:51:45.320 align:start position:0%
pay per check um three to 4% of
 
05:51:47.948 --> 05:51:47.958 align:start position:0%
employees is is an estimate so nacha has
 
05:51:49.548 --> 05:51:49.558 align:start position:0%
they maintain you know they keep a
 
05:51:51.270 --> 05:51:51.280 align:start position:0%
roster of what percentage of employee
 
05:51:53.190 --> 05:51:53.200 align:start position:0%
workers already use direct deposit and
 
05:51:56.190 --> 05:51:56.200 align:start position:0%
that's at least 93% 94% something like
 
05:51:58.628 --> 05:51:58.638 align:start position:0%
that so the balance of 6% of employees
 
05:52:00.030 --> 05:52:00.040 align:start position:0%
either get a paper check or they get the
 
05:52:02.390 --> 05:52:02.400 align:start position:0%
debit cards today so it's some I'm
 
05:52:05.430 --> 05:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
guessing um you know 2 3% of employees
 
05:52:08.590 --> 05:52:08.600 align:start position:0%
get paper checks today still follow up
 
05:52:13.110 --> 05:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
follow up I'm I'm curious uh one of the
 
05:52:14.548 --> 05:52:14.558 align:start position:0%
things you just said in your testimon
 
05:52:16.670 --> 05:52:16.680 align:start position:0%
make it easier is by not it's it's a
 
05:52:19.190 --> 05:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
snowstorm whatever employee cannot go to
 
05:52:22.868 --> 05:52:22.878 align:start position:0%
the bank cash their check I'm curious in
 
05:52:25.350 --> 05:52:25.360 align:start position:0%
that same study that you just talked
 
05:52:27.830 --> 05:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
about how many of those 3 to 4% of
 
05:52:29.910 --> 05:52:29.920 align:start position:0%
employees do not have online banking
 
05:52:31.150 --> 05:52:31.160 align:start position:0%
where you can take a picture of the
 
05:52:33.030 --> 05:52:33.040 align:start position:0%
check in 30 seconds and it's in your
 
05:52:34.350 --> 05:52:34.360 align:start position:0%
account I mean you still have to wait
 
05:52:35.990 --> 05:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
for it to clear but you know they don't
 
05:52:37.270 --> 05:52:37.280 align:start position:0%
actually physically have to go to the
 
05:52:39.430 --> 05:52:39.440 align:start position:0%
bank you're right uh thank you that's a
 
05:52:41.510 --> 05:52:41.520 align:start position:0%
good point uh and really the uh the
 
05:52:43.788 --> 05:52:43.798 align:start position:0%
major issue is getting to the workplace
 
05:52:45.430 --> 05:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
or somehow getting that physical check
 
05:52:47.590 --> 05:52:47.600 align:start position:0%
so if you don't get a chance to get to
 
05:52:48.830 --> 05:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
the workplace because you're sick that
 
05:52:51.230 --> 05:52:51.240 align:start position:0%
day or that week or whatever um how do
 
05:52:52.628 --> 05:52:52.638 align:start position:0%
you get that check and often times
 
05:52:55.030 --> 05:52:55.040 align:start position:0%
employers will just mail them and so
 
05:52:56.310 --> 05:52:56.320 align:start position:0%
that's several
 
05:52:58.750 --> 05:52:58.760 align:start position:0%
days yeah and you know to the point
 
05:53:00.310 --> 05:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
earlier of you know would be be willing
 
05:53:02.788 --> 05:53:02.798 align:start position:0%
to um to pay people earlier who accepted
 
05:53:06.628 --> 05:53:06.638 align:start position:0%
a a a payroll check or a payroll card U
 
05:53:09.030 --> 05:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
that naturally happens um just because
 
05:53:10.590 --> 05:53:10.600 align:start position:0%
um the banking system the banks
 
05:53:13.590 --> 05:53:13.600 align:start position:0%
generally release payroll payments a day
 
05:53:15.910 --> 05:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
or two prior to the scheduled release
 
05:53:18.750 --> 05:53:18.760 align:start position:0%
date as a a marketing incentive sort of
 
05:53:19.868 --> 05:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
thing so if you're you'll see
 
05:53:21.150 --> 05:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
advertisements from Banks all the time
 
05:53:23.150 --> 05:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
come to us you'll get your payroll two
 
05:53:24.788 --> 05:53:24.798 align:start position:0%
days faster and that they actually do
 
05:53:26.750 --> 05:53:26.760 align:start position:0%
that so if you get a payroll card you're
 
05:53:28.230 --> 05:53:28.240 align:start position:0%
actually getting your pay on Wednesday
 
05:53:30.350 --> 05:53:30.360 align:start position:0%
that everybody else is getting paid on
 
05:53:33.468 --> 05:53:33.478 align:start position:0%
Friday one more question
 
05:53:36.788 --> 05:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
follow so to eliminate so the you're
 
05:53:38.468 --> 05:53:38.478 align:start position:0%
saying the real problem is more so just
 
05:53:41.270 --> 05:53:41.280 align:start position:0%
being able to get to the workplace on on
 
05:53:44.190 --> 05:53:44.200 align:start position:0%
payday um and I can understand that but
 
05:53:46.548 --> 05:53:46.558 align:start position:0%
would you agree that direct deposit
 
05:53:49.990 --> 05:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
already takes care of that column itself
 
05:53:51.868 --> 05:53:51.878 align:start position:0%
yes this is the supplement to direct
 
05:53:53.670 --> 05:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
deposit direct deposit is a great answer
 
05:53:57.150 --> 05:53:57.160 align:start position:0%
for 93% at least 93% of the workforce so
 
05:53:58.628 --> 05:53:58.638 align:start position:0%
for those who don't have direct deposit
 
05:54:00.070 --> 05:54:00.080 align:start position:0%
for example they don't have a bank
 
05:54:01.548 --> 05:54:01.558 align:start position:0%
account and they don't want a bank
 
05:54:03.708 --> 05:54:03.718 align:start position:0%
account this gives them the functional
 
05:54:05.030 --> 05:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
equivalent of a bank account they can
 
05:54:07.070 --> 05:54:07.080 align:start position:0%
use this card to make like online
 
05:54:08.910 --> 05:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
payments you know buy things on the
 
05:54:10.270 --> 05:54:10.280 align:start position:0%
internet make you know travel
 
05:54:11.788 --> 05:54:11.798 align:start position:0%
Arrangements things whatever you can do
 
05:54:13.670 --> 05:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
with a card that um that they previously
 
05:54:15.708 --> 05:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
didn't have a bank Arrangement at all
 
05:54:17.310 --> 05:54:17.320 align:start position:0%
now they have an electronic account a
 
05:54:19.830 --> 05:54:19.840 align:start position:0%
card they can they're in the they're in
 
05:54:21.670 --> 05:54:21.680 align:start position:0%
the internet
 
05:54:23.670 --> 05:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
economy thank
 
05:54:25.830 --> 05:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
you pres of
 
05:54:27.708 --> 05:54:27.718 align:start position:0%
grer thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
05:54:30.150 --> 05:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh is ADP likely
 
05:54:32.430 --> 05:54:32.440 align:start position:0%
to either save money or make money by
 
05:54:34.270 --> 05:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
not having to pay postage on checks that
 
05:54:35.868 --> 05:54:35.878 align:start position:0%
they ship
 
05:54:39.510 --> 05:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
out it is a cost-saving uh
 
05:54:42.430 --> 05:54:42.440 align:start position:0%
measure um so yeah the cost of uh you
 
05:54:45.468 --> 05:54:45.478 align:start position:0%
know printing mailing um you know we we
 
05:54:48.430 --> 05:54:48.440 align:start position:0%
were anxious to get to electronic as as
 
05:54:50.070 --> 05:54:50.080 align:start position:0%
fast as possible as are all the small
 
05:54:52.070 --> 05:54:52.080 align:start position:0%
businesses that use our services to the
 
05:54:53.430 --> 05:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
extent that we save money our clients
 
05:54:56.110 --> 05:54:56.120 align:start position:0%
save money that that is a factor yes
 
05:54:58.868 --> 05:54:58.878 align:start position:0%
thank you follow up
 
05:55:01.190 --> 05:55:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh is if if this bill were to pass would
 
05:55:05.070 --> 05:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
ADP plan to charge uh employers uh for
 
05:55:07.430 --> 05:55:07.440 align:start position:0%
the uh for the additional service of
 
05:55:11.070 --> 05:55:11.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:13.350 --> 05:55:13.360 align:start position:0%
employees would ADP charge for the
 
05:55:14.750 --> 05:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
service of sending checks out to
 
05:55:18.590 --> 05:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
employees um I we charge employers today
 
05:55:21.270 --> 05:55:21.280 align:start position:0%
to print checks already so that would be
 
05:55:22.948 --> 05:55:22.958 align:start position:0%
a cost savings to the extent that they
 
05:55:25.110 --> 05:55:25.120 align:start position:0%
no longer have to have us Che print
 
05:55:26.948 --> 05:55:26.958 align:start position:0%
physical checks for employees so it's
 
05:55:28.468 --> 05:55:28.478 align:start position:0%
cheaper for them to to administer
 
05:55:30.590 --> 05:55:30.600 align:start position:0%
payroll if they can do it electronically
 
05:55:32.230 --> 05:55:32.240 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that answers your
 
05:55:39.350 --> 05:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:41.030 --> 05:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
you I'll give you a second
 
05:55:44.070 --> 05:55:44.080 align:start position:0%
representative C thank you Mr chair then
 
05:55:47.150 --> 05:55:47.160 align:start position:0%
then clar if uh thank you for taking my
 
05:55:49.910 --> 05:55:49.920 align:start position:0%
question if I was to receive uh my
 
05:55:53.230 --> 05:55:53.240 align:start position:0%
payroll with a wisely ATM card and I was
 
05:55:54.830 --> 05:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
to go shopping with that and that's how
 
05:55:57.948 --> 05:55:57.958 align:start position:0%
I chose to spend my money is ADP reive
 
05:56:00.628 --> 05:56:00.638 align:start position:0%
receiv receiving um Merchant fees or any
 
05:56:02.990 --> 05:56:03.000 align:start position:0%
fees for the use of my card at any of
 
05:56:03.000 --> 05:56:04.030 align:start position:0%
fees for the use of my card at any of
these

05:56:04.030 --> 05:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
these
 
05:56:06.070 --> 05:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
Merchants um yeah my understanding is
 
05:56:08.390 --> 05:56:08.400 align:start position:0%
that ADP receives a percentage of the
 
05:56:10.310 --> 05:56:10.320 align:start position:0%
swipe fees the transaction fees that the
 
05:56:13.030 --> 05:56:13.040 align:start position:0%
merchants pay for this so that's part of
 
05:56:14.510 --> 05:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
how this is all paid for and again that
 
05:56:17.070 --> 05:56:17.080 align:start position:0%
results in lower fees for the small
 
05:56:18.910 --> 05:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
business clients that have to administer
 
05:56:22.468 --> 05:56:22.478 align:start position:0%
payroll it does reduce their
 
05:56:25.270 --> 05:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
costs representative Clark followed by
 
05:56:28.830 --> 05:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
Mackenzie thank you um
 
05:56:31.468 --> 05:56:31.478 align:start position:0%
you're saying that having that ad ADP
 
05:56:33.150 --> 05:56:33.160 align:start position:0%
card you wouldn't necessarily have to
 
05:56:35.468 --> 05:56:35.478 align:start position:0%
have a bank account correct correct and
 
05:56:39.390 --> 05:56:39.400 align:start position:0%
just that was just a pre if I may um my
 
05:56:42.990 --> 05:56:43.000 align:start position:0%
debit card was recently hacked and I got
 
05:56:44.510 --> 05:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
it wasn't a ton of money it was like 70
 
05:56:47.230 --> 05:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
bucks what happens in that case my my
 
05:56:49.590 --> 05:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
bank protected me and refunded me the
 
05:56:52.270 --> 05:56:52.280 align:start position:0%
money what happens if that would happen
 
05:56:55.190 --> 05:56:55.200 align:start position:0%
with the ADP card I'm sorry to hear that
 
05:56:57.110 --> 05:56:57.120 align:start position:0%
uh on your behalf but um yeah it's a
 
05:56:58.670 --> 05:56:58.680 align:start position:0%
very good point actually the all these
 
05:57:00.910 --> 05:57:00.920 align:start position:0%
debit cards are protected by um the same
 
05:57:02.948 --> 05:57:02.958 align:start position:0%
rules that apply to credit cards so the
 
05:57:05.510 --> 05:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
fraud protections the the protections
 
05:57:07.948 --> 05:57:07.958 align:start position:0%
against unauthorized use are there with
 
05:57:09.628 --> 05:57:09.638 align:start position:0%
these payroll cards so that's part of
 
05:57:11.708 --> 05:57:11.718 align:start position:0%
you know Federal Law requires it and
 
05:57:13.548 --> 05:57:13.558 align:start position:0%
employees can you know if they are
 
05:57:15.110 --> 05:57:15.120 align:start position:0%
hacked if they are stol money stolen
 
05:57:17.270 --> 05:57:17.280 align:start position:0%
from their card uh unauthorized use
 
05:57:18.830 --> 05:57:18.840 align:start position:0%
anything like that uh there's even
 
05:57:20.868 --> 05:57:20.878 align:start position:0%
dispute resolution so if they buy buy
 
05:57:22.468 --> 05:57:22.478 align:start position:0%
something on the Internet that never
 
05:57:24.468 --> 05:57:24.478 align:start position:0%
arrives they can use that to go back to
 
05:57:25.868 --> 05:57:25.878 align:start position:0%
the bank and say look I never got this
 
05:57:27.468 --> 05:57:27.478 align:start position:0%
you know reverse the transaction those
 
05:57:29.390 --> 05:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
kinds of protections apply automatically
 
05:57:31.788 --> 05:57:31.798 align:start position:0%
to employees and doesn't cost
 
05:57:34.430 --> 05:57:34.440 align:start position:0%
anything just a quick followup how about
 
05:57:36.230 --> 05:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
the fees that may be applied to a
 
05:57:38.190 --> 05:57:38.200 align:start position:0%
bounced payment for
 
05:57:40.750 --> 05:57:40.760 align:start position:0%
something um yeah for in insufficient
 
05:57:43.070 --> 05:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
funds fees there there are none with um
 
05:57:45.030 --> 05:57:45.040 align:start position:0%
payroll cards um basically anything that
 
05:57:47.590 --> 05:57:47.600 align:start position:0%
would cause an insufficient funds
 
05:57:50.030 --> 05:57:50.040 align:start position:0%
transaction uh they were just rejected
 
05:57:52.390 --> 05:57:52.400 align:start position:0%
right so there's a decline transaction
 
05:57:53.830 --> 05:57:53.840 align:start position:0%
that would occur if you if you buy
 
05:57:54.830 --> 05:57:54.840 align:start position:0%
something there's not enough money on
 
05:57:56.670 --> 05:57:56.680 align:start position:0%
your card it would just say oh you know
 
05:57:58.310 --> 05:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
U purchase declined
 
05:58:00.030 --> 05:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
and there's no NSF so there's no NSF
 
05:58:01.788 --> 05:58:01.798 align:start position:0%
fees with these cards there may be a
 
05:58:03.350 --> 05:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
declined transaction fee which is like a
 
05:58:06.070 --> 05:58:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:08.910 --> 05:58:08.920 align:start position:0%
think but even then I think the cfpb is
 
05:58:12.430 --> 05:58:12.440 align:start position:0%
is proposing that they may prohibit that
 
05:58:15.670 --> 05:58:15.680 align:start position:0%
so that's just been
 
05:58:17.948 --> 05:58:17.958 align:start position:0%
announced representative McKenzie
 
05:58:17.958 --> 05:58:20.310 align:start position:0%
announced representative McKenzie
followed

05:58:20.310 --> 05:58:20.320 align:start position:0%
followed
 
05:58:24.548 --> 05:58:24.558 align:start position:0%
byair kill and then we'll go over
 
05:58:27.310 --> 05:58:27.320 align:start position:0%
here thank you for coming for the
 
05:58:30.750 --> 05:58:30.760 align:start position:0%
committee and for taking my question the
 
05:58:32.708 --> 05:58:32.718 align:start position:0%
the question I have relates to the
 
05:58:34.350 --> 05:58:34.360 align:start position:0%
Integrity of the
 
05:58:37.310 --> 05:58:37.320 align:start position:0%
process right now if I would if a vendor
 
05:58:38.830 --> 05:58:38.840 align:start position:0%
would to give me a check I could call
 
05:58:41.750 --> 05:58:41.760 align:start position:0%
the bank and say is this check
 
05:58:44.990 --> 05:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
good so I can verify right off the bat
 
05:58:47.590 --> 05:58:47.600 align:start position:0%
there's money in the bank you isue me a
 
05:58:50.190 --> 05:58:50.200 align:start position:0%
payroll card or the group of us payroll
 
05:58:53.150 --> 05:58:53.160 align:start position:0%
cards how do I verify whether or not
 
05:58:56.270 --> 05:58:56.280 align:start position:0%
there's money in the bank and can can
 
05:58:59.030 --> 05:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
somebody uh with draw
 
05:59:02.830 --> 05:59:02.840 align:start position:0%
money the person who's backing that card
 
05:59:04.868 --> 05:59:04.878 align:start position:0%
are they able to withdraw money from
 
05:59:07.110 --> 05:59:07.120 align:start position:0%
that account once it's in
 
05:59:10.150 --> 05:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
there you understand my understand my
 
05:59:12.990 --> 05:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
question yeah I'm not sure um if I got
 
05:59:15.030 --> 05:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
the question right but um basically um
 
05:59:17.190 --> 05:59:17.200 align:start position:0%
you know if you have a card you know
 
05:59:19.230 --> 05:59:19.240 align:start position:0%
even if you don't see anybody from work
 
05:59:20.510 --> 05:59:20.520 align:start position:0%
you don't get your your statement of
 
05:59:21.670 --> 05:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
deductions you don't get your pay
 
05:59:23.150 --> 05:59:23.160 align:start position:0%
statement that week because you're
 
05:59:25.708 --> 05:59:25.718 align:start position:0%
you're off and on vacation um the
 
05:59:27.190 --> 05:59:27.200 align:start position:0%
question is how much is on my card you
 
05:59:28.510 --> 05:59:28.520 align:start position:0%
can just you know open up your phone
 
05:59:30.510 --> 05:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
open up the app the my wisely app in the
 
05:59:32.590 --> 05:59:32.600 align:start position:0%
case of ADP and it'll show you the the
 
05:59:34.070 --> 05:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
balance on the card your most recent
 
05:59:37.670 --> 05:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
transactions things like that so once it
 
05:59:40.830 --> 05:59:40.840 align:start position:0%
follow up yes so I I'm not sure he was
 
05:59:42.510 --> 05:59:42.520 align:start position:0%
done answering but were you done
 
05:59:43.750 --> 05:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
answering or you going to answer the
 
05:59:45.830 --> 05:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
second part or you're okay with um I
 
05:59:48.110 --> 05:59:48.120 align:start position:0%
think get I don't think I wasn't sure
 
05:59:49.830 --> 05:59:49.840 align:start position:0%
the nature of the question is how to
 
05:59:52.990 --> 05:59:53.000 align:start position:0%
withdraw funds from it the question is
 
05:59:54.390 --> 05:59:54.400 align:start position:0%
can the employer
 
05:59:57.350 --> 05:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
employer take the money out employer put
 
05:59:59.990 --> 06:00:00.000 align:start position:0%
money in the bank yeah to cover these
 
06:00:03.270 --> 06:00:03.280 align:start position:0%
cards yeah it's it's the same as um it's
 
06:00:04.270 --> 06:00:04.280 align:start position:0%
the same as any other banking
 
06:00:06.030 --> 06:00:06.040 align:start position:0%
Arrangement once the employer pushes
 
06:00:07.788 --> 06:00:07.798 align:start position:0%
payroll dollars to the account it's the
 
06:00:09.990 --> 06:00:10.000 align:start position:0%
employes account the employer has no
 
06:00:11.830 --> 06:00:11.840 align:start position:0%
visibility of what the employee does
 
06:00:13.708 --> 06:00:13.718 align:start position:0%
with those monies they can't draw those
 
06:00:16.110 --> 06:00:16.120 align:start position:0%
monies back out from the account I mean
 
06:00:17.628 --> 06:00:17.638 align:start position:0%
the the wage and nrow laws prohibit that
 
06:00:19.830 --> 06:00:19.840 align:start position:0%
anyway but the technical you know notcha
 
06:00:22.590 --> 06:00:22.600 align:start position:0%
rules also prohibit um uh employers from
 
06:00:23.948 --> 06:00:23.958 align:start position:0%
doing that unless they do a replacement
 
06:00:25.590 --> 06:00:25.600 align:start position:0%
right away kind of thing so there are
 
06:00:27.868 --> 06:00:27.878 align:start position:0%
stringent rules for how that gets done
 
06:00:29.030 --> 06:00:29.040 align:start position:0%
and only in the case of like
 
06:00:29.040 --> 06:00:31.708 align:start position:0%
and only in the case of like
administrative

06:00:31.708 --> 06:00:31.718 align:start position:0%
 
06:00:34.590 --> 06:00:34.600 align:start position:0%
errors I'd like to follow after with the
 
06:00:38.948 --> 06:00:38.958 align:start position:0%
do gu my question please you'd like to
 
06:00:42.468 --> 06:00:42.478 align:start position:0%

06:01:41.350 --> 06:01:41.360 align:start position:0%
transaction swipe fees to to be that
 
06:01:42.830 --> 06:01:42.840 align:start position:0%

taking another question I maybe I'm not
 
06:02:15.510 --> 06:02:15.520 align:start position:0%
envisioning this right but as a business
 
06:02:18.310 --> 06:02:18.320 align:start position:0%
owner myself I'm envisioning a box of
 
06:02:20.430 --> 06:02:20.440 align:start position:0%
empty debit cards sitting on my desk
 
06:02:23.510 --> 06:02:23.520 align:start position:0%
that I will give out to new employees or
 
06:02:26.468 --> 06:02:26.478 align:start position:0%
um Etc H how much do those debit cards
 
06:02:27.948 --> 06:02:27.958 align:start position:0%
cost me
 
06:02:31.030 --> 06:02:31.040 align:start position:0%
cost the employer yes to yeah because
 
06:02:32.390 --> 06:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to need if I have to replace
 
06:02:34.030 --> 06:02:34.040 align:start position:0%
one on a weekend coming back for the
 
06:02:37.150 --> 06:02:37.160 align:start position:0%
24hour rule I'm GNA have to obviously
 
06:02:39.628 --> 06:02:39.638 align:start position:0%
print up a new one or activate a new one
 
06:02:41.390 --> 06:02:41.400 align:start position:0%
how how much do those how much do those
 
06:02:43.430 --> 06:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
cost it's a good question I'm not sure I
 
06:02:45.350 --> 06:02:45.360 align:start position:0%
know the answer again let me take that
 
06:02:46.948 --> 06:02:46.958 align:start position:0%
back and confirm it but I I do want to
 
06:02:49.750 --> 06:02:49.760 align:start position:0%
say because it came up before um you
 
06:02:51.788 --> 06:02:51.798 align:start position:0%
know how exactly what's the expectation
 
06:02:53.468 --> 06:02:53.478 align:start position:0%
for employers if an employee loses their
 
06:02:55.270 --> 06:02:55.280 align:start position:0%
card or their dog eats the card and they
 
06:02:56.948 --> 06:02:56.958 align:start position:0%
need a new one um so they call the
 
06:02:58.350 --> 06:02:58.360 align:start position:0%
employer and within 24 hours the
 
06:03:00.110 --> 06:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
employeer is supposed to respond the way
 
06:03:01.990 --> 06:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
we handle that is we give every one of
 
06:03:04.628 --> 06:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
our clients a stock of you know maybe a
 
06:03:07.430 --> 06:03:07.440 align:start position:0%
dozen um instant issue cards which they
 
06:03:09.230 --> 06:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
can you know just feed into their
 
06:03:13.110 --> 06:03:13.120 align:start position:0%
computer um and and shift the money from
 
06:03:15.750 --> 06:03:15.760 align:start position:0%
the now destroyed card or lost card onto
 
06:03:17.350 --> 06:03:17.360 align:start position:0%
the new card and just hand it to the
 
06:03:21.468 --> 06:03:21.478 align:start position:0%
employee so it's very easy to do um in
 
06:03:22.910 --> 06:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
you know and that was relates to the
 
06:03:24.070 --> 06:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
question that came up earlier that you
 
06:03:25.708 --> 06:03:25.718 align:start position:0%
know hey adp's closed on the weekend
 
06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
what's an employer supposed to do with
 
06:03:28.590 --> 06:03:28.600 align:start position:0%
this 24-hour turnaround sort of thing
 
06:03:30.708 --> 06:03:30.718 align:start position:0%
but they have a stock of instant issue
 
06:03:32.910 --> 06:03:32.920 align:start position:0%
cards they can use to to replace those
 
06:03:34.708 --> 06:03:34.718 align:start position:0%
what those cost though I am not sure and
 
06:03:36.468 --> 06:03:36.478 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's even a separate
 
06:03:38.110 --> 06:03:38.120 align:start position:0%
charge to our clients for that but let
 
06:03:39.708 --> 06:03:39.718 align:start position:0%
me find out and get back to you that's
 
06:03:43.430 --> 06:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
right okay um I have another question
 
06:03:46.830 --> 06:03:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:49.110 --> 06:03:49.120 align:start position:0%
second I'm
 
06:03:52.030 --> 06:03:52.040 align:start position:0%
curious if there's
 
06:03:54.788 --> 06:03:54.798 align:start position:0%
a if there's a default on the card
 
06:03:56.548 --> 06:03:56.558 align:start position:0%
that's not the employer's fault it's a
 
06:03:59.070 --> 06:03:59.080 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing default on a card provided
 
06:04:01.670 --> 06:04:01.680 align:start position:0%
by ADP why is the employer the one
 
06:04:03.788 --> 06:04:03.798 align:start position:0%
that's unnecessarily burdened on the
 
06:04:05.190 --> 06:04:05.200 align:start position:0%
weekend why is that not something that's
 
06:04:08.350 --> 06:04:08.360 align:start position:0%
handled by ADP it's not the employer's
 
06:04:10.868 --> 06:04:10.878 align:start position:0%
fault okay I'm not sure that I got the
 
06:04:12.270 --> 06:04:12.280 align:start position:0%
question if there's a problem with the
 
06:04:14.708 --> 06:04:14.718 align:start position:0%
card that it's not the employer's fault
 
06:04:18.948 --> 06:04:18.958 align:start position:0%
well it's the line I read earlier
 
06:04:22.430 --> 06:04:22.440 align:start position:0%
1819 yes it it says uh technical
 
06:04:25.590 --> 06:04:25.600 align:start position:0%
or uh a technical or a processing defect
 
06:04:27.230 --> 06:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
now to me that means maybe the magnetic
 
06:04:29.510 --> 06:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
strip is just defective or something
 
06:04:31.510 --> 06:04:31.520 align:start position:0%
there's a bank error anything like that
 
06:04:33.910 --> 06:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
that so that's not really the employer's
 
06:04:35.468 --> 06:04:35.478 align:start position:0%
fault that's really something this
 
06:04:36.990 --> 06:04:37.000 align:start position:0%
provided by ADP so why is it the
 
06:04:38.708 --> 06:04:38.718 align:start position:0%
employer's responsibility to be back on
 
06:04:40.390 --> 06:04:40.400 align:start position:0%
a weekend to pay that's a very good
 
06:04:41.628 --> 06:04:41.638 align:start position:0%
question and really it should be the
 
06:04:43.190 --> 06:04:43.200 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the bank or whoever
 
06:04:44.510 --> 06:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
the you know whoever caused the problem
 
06:04:46.788 --> 06:04:46.798 align:start position:0%
ADP if they cause the problem um the
 
06:04:48.390 --> 06:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
only way that we can write that into
 
06:04:50.270 --> 06:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
state law though is to to make the
 
06:04:53.510 --> 06:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
employer responsible they you know they
 
06:04:57.150 --> 06:04:57.160 align:start position:0%
remain responsible um but they go after
 
06:04:59.910 --> 06:04:59.920 align:start position:0%
ADP they go after the bank you know uh
 
06:05:01.548 --> 06:05:01.558 align:start position:0%
for reimbursement if there is a cost
 
06:05:03.788 --> 06:05:03.798 align:start position:0%
that they occurred because of that under
 
06:05:07.628 --> 06:05:07.638 align:start position:0%
contract we um you know we we won't
 
06:05:10.150 --> 06:05:10.160 align:start position:0%
cause a problem that costs our clients
 
06:05:13.110 --> 06:05:13.120 align:start position:0%
money and then leave it to them to to
 
06:05:14.708 --> 06:05:14.718 align:start position:0%
pay the the difference they come to us
 
06:05:17.230 --> 06:05:17.240 align:start position:0%
and say this cost me quite a bit um you
 
06:05:20.350 --> 06:05:20.360 align:start position:0%
know make it good but they really just
 
06:05:22.830 --> 06:05:22.840 align:start position:0%
recover that in uh via
 
06:05:26.070 --> 06:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
contract if that makes
 
06:05:29.868 --> 06:05:29.878 align:start position:0%
sense yeah it does make sense I'm just I
 
06:05:32.548 --> 06:05:32.558 align:start position:0%
use this example last year that you know
 
06:05:34.788 --> 06:05:34.798 align:start position:0%
if I'm away on the weekend four hours
 
06:05:37.548 --> 06:05:37.558 align:start position:0%
away well now I'm coming back I'm
 
06:05:39.190 --> 06:05:39.200 align:start position:0%
probably out that hotel room I paid for
 
06:05:41.708 --> 06:05:41.718 align:start position:0%
that night but ADP is going to cover
 
06:05:41.718 --> 06:05:44.510 align:start position:0%
that night but ADP is going to cover
that

06:05:44.510 --> 06:05:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:46.390 --> 06:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
expense it's a good point I'm sure
 
06:05:48.990 --> 06:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
there's an infinite uh number of you
 
06:05:51.190 --> 06:05:51.200 align:start position:0%
know scenarios that uh you'd want to
 
06:05:53.670 --> 06:05:53.680 align:start position:0%
think about and you know does a client
 
06:05:55.150 --> 06:05:55.160 align:start position:0%
make an issue of it do they come to us
 
06:05:57.150 --> 06:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
and say this was very hard for me you
 
06:05:58.868 --> 06:05:58.878 align:start position:0%
know what are you going to do to make it
 
06:06:00.910 --> 06:06:00.920 align:start position:0%
right and you know obviously there's
 
06:06:02.468 --> 06:06:02.478 align:start position:0%
many other payroll companies out there
 
06:06:05.150 --> 06:06:05.160 align:start position:0%
and how are they going to behave but uh
 
06:06:06.910 --> 06:06:06.920 align:start position:0%
I think that you know for for state law
 
06:06:08.910 --> 06:06:08.920 align:start position:0%
purposes what you do is make the
 
06:06:11.830 --> 06:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
employer the responsible party and they
 
06:06:13.788 --> 06:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
sort it out with the banks they sort it
 
06:06:15.868 --> 06:06:15.878 align:start position:0%
out with the payroll companies if there
 
06:06:19.150 --> 06:06:19.160 align:start position:0%
are any problems okay thank you
 
06:06:19.160 --> 06:06:20.110 align:start position:0%
are any problems okay thank you
representative

06:06:20.110 --> 06:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:06:21.990 --> 06:06:22.000 align:start position:0%
Granger thank you thank you for taking
 
06:06:24.468 --> 06:06:24.478 align:start position:0%
my question so considering ADP is so
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
large of a company uh wouldn't they
 
06:06:28.310 --> 06:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
yield If This Were passed wouldn't they
 
06:06:29.990 --> 06:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
yield a massive amount of power over the
 
06:06:31.510 --> 06:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
banking sector by being able to pick
 
06:06:33.190 --> 06:06:33.200 align:start position:0%
winners and losers based on who they
 
06:06:35.868 --> 06:06:35.878 align:start position:0%
send money for the payroll cards to so
 
06:06:37.270 --> 06:06:37.280 align:start position:0%
there's a bank that has to administer
 
06:06:40.230 --> 06:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
the payroll card right so wouldn't ADP
 
06:06:41.670 --> 06:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
be able to pick winners and losers on
 
06:06:43.230 --> 06:06:43.240 align:start position:0%
the banking Market based on who they
 
06:06:44.830 --> 06:06:44.840 align:start position:0%
choose and who they choose not to do
 
06:06:44.840 --> 06:06:47.310 align:start position:0%
choose and who they choose not to do
banking

06:06:47.310 --> 06:06:47.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:49.548 --> 06:06:49.558 align:start position:0%
through um it's an interesting point I
 
06:06:52.230 --> 06:06:52.240 align:start position:0%
mean ADP is one of many many uh payroll
 
06:06:54.868 --> 06:06:54.878 align:start position:0%
companies out there we have a you know
 
06:06:57.310 --> 06:06:57.320 align:start position:0%
an arrangement with a company called ly
 
06:06:59.150 --> 06:06:59.160 align:start position:0%
and they have their partnership with
 
06:07:00.788 --> 06:07:00.798 align:start position:0%
banks that that administer that
 
06:07:02.948 --> 06:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
particular card but you know it's a it's
 
06:07:05.510 --> 06:07:05.520 align:start position:0%
a free market um there are many
 
06:07:09.430 --> 06:07:09.440 align:start position:0%
Arrangements many banks many payroll
 
06:07:11.350 --> 06:07:11.360 align:start position:0%
companies it's a good question I'm not
 
06:07:13.548 --> 06:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
really sure how to respond to it though
 
06:07:13.558 --> 06:07:16.628 align:start position:0%
really sure how to respond to it though
thank

06:07:16.628 --> 06:07:16.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:18.830 --> 06:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
you representative Clair followed by
 
06:07:21.830 --> 06:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative balani um thank you both
 
06:07:23.670 --> 06:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
just kind of following up on something R
 
06:07:27.150 --> 06:07:27.160 align:start position:0%
Drago said and it's been actually
 
06:07:30.030 --> 06:07:30.040 align:start position:0%
brought up a few times replacing a card
 
06:07:31.708 --> 06:07:31.718 align:start position:0%
not every transaction shows up
 
06:07:34.150 --> 06:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
immediately so say as one of the
 
06:07:36.030 --> 06:07:36.040 align:start position:0%
business owners suggested they had to
 
06:07:37.910 --> 06:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
replace a card and they replaced it with
 
06:07:40.150 --> 06:07:40.160 align:start position:0%
say a $500 balance but the person had
 
06:07:43.350 --> 06:07:43.360 align:start position:0%
used $150 of it and hadn't shown up yet
 
06:07:45.468 --> 06:07:45.478 align:start position:0%
what happens to the money that they
 
06:07:48.350 --> 06:07:48.360 align:start position:0%
replaced on the card not knowing that
 
06:07:51.590 --> 06:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
150 or whatever has already been used
 
06:07:54.548 --> 06:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
what'll happen
 
06:07:57.468 --> 06:07:57.478 align:start position:0%
then it's a good question um yeah there
 
06:07:59.628 --> 06:07:59.638 align:start position:0%
may be um sort of what they call um
 
06:08:01.548 --> 06:08:01.558 align:start position:0%
offline transactions where for example
 
06:08:03.070 --> 06:08:03.080 align:start position:0%
the phone lines are down the electricity
 
06:08:05.070 --> 06:08:05.080 align:start position:0%
is off and they write down the the card
 
06:08:06.628 --> 06:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
numbers and they process them later I
 
06:08:08.030 --> 06:08:08.040 align:start position:0%
mean that's about the only example where
 
06:08:10.070 --> 06:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
you might have a transaction that's not
 
06:08:12.390 --> 06:08:12.400 align:start position:0%
instantly known to the banking system
 
06:08:14.750 --> 06:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
otherwise um all of these transactions
 
06:08:17.310 --> 06:08:17.320 align:start position:0%
are uh real time so they update the
 
06:08:19.910 --> 06:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
banking system immediately um in every
 
06:08:21.948 --> 06:08:21.958 align:start position:0%
case so that somebody can't take a card
 
06:08:23.708 --> 06:08:23.718 align:start position:0%
with a certain amount of money and run
 
06:08:26.070 --> 06:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
around to five different shops and spend
 
06:08:27.910 --> 06:08:27.920 align:start position:0%
five times the amount that is on the
 
06:08:30.350 --> 06:08:30.360 align:start position:0%
card so all that all that is very real
 
06:08:32.548 --> 06:08:32.558 align:start position:0%
time but you know you could imagine if
 
06:08:33.910 --> 06:08:33.920 align:start position:0%
the power's out and the phone lines are
 
06:08:35.628 --> 06:08:35.638 align:start position:0%
down and somebody writes down the the
 
06:08:37.310 --> 06:08:37.320 align:start position:0%
debit card numbers and transacts it
 
06:08:40.548 --> 06:08:40.558 align:start position:0%
later that could happen can I follow up
 
06:08:43.350 --> 06:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
please yeah that's I don't I guess that
 
06:08:45.030 --> 06:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
could happen but I you know I've made
 
06:08:47.628 --> 06:08:47.638 align:start position:0%
transactions on my debit cards and maybe
 
06:08:50.628 --> 06:08:50.638 align:start position:0%
not see it until the next business day
 
06:08:53.788 --> 06:08:53.798 align:start position:0%
okay so that's not the same scenario as
 
06:08:56.030 --> 06:08:56.040 align:start position:0%
what you're saying but it does happen
 
06:08:58.070 --> 06:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
well I think they issue is that the the
 
06:09:00.670 --> 06:09:00.680 align:start position:0%
banking system displays the transaction
 
06:09:02.190 --> 06:09:02.200 align:start position:0%
on the following day to the consumer the
 
06:09:03.948 --> 06:09:03.958 align:start position:0%
banking system itself knows of the
 
06:09:05.430 --> 06:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
transaction immediately and they
 
06:09:07.910 --> 06:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
wouldn't permit a second over you know
 
06:09:09.310 --> 06:09:09.320 align:start position:0%
additional transaction if it would
 
06:09:10.830 --> 06:09:10.840 align:start position:0%
overdraw the
 
06:09:13.628 --> 06:09:13.638 align:start position:0%
account okay does that but that does
 
06:09:15.310 --> 06:09:15.320 align:start position:0%
that protect them as well like the
 
06:09:17.390 --> 06:09:17.400 align:start position:0%
business owner as well saying okay yes
 
06:09:19.070 --> 06:09:19.080 align:start position:0%
there were transactions I don't see them
 
06:09:20.310 --> 06:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
yet but the bank is telling me that
 
06:09:22.390 --> 06:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
there's a Balan is on the card right and
 
06:09:24.270 --> 06:09:24.280 align:start position:0%
it should be the correct balance yes it
 
06:09:33.310 --> 06:09:33.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:09:35.070 --> 06:09:35.080 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr
 
06:09:38.750 --> 06:09:38.760 align:start position:0%
chairman uh does a an employee receive a
 
06:09:41.750 --> 06:09:41.760 align:start position:0%
new um pay card every single week or is
 
06:09:43.628 --> 06:09:43.638 align:start position:0%
the money put do they have one pay card
 
06:09:45.190 --> 06:09:45.200 align:start position:0%
and the money just keeps getting added
 
06:09:47.110 --> 06:09:47.120 align:start position:0%
onto that throughout their employment
 
06:09:48.548 --> 06:09:48.558 align:start position:0%
yeah it's it's one card it's
 
06:09:50.948 --> 06:09:50.958 align:start position:0%
personalized um so I have mine right
 
06:09:53.510 --> 06:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
here I'll show you that's okay just a
 
06:09:56.230 --> 06:09:56.240 align:start position:0%
regular wisely ADP card but yeah it's
 
06:09:57.788 --> 06:09:57.798 align:start position:0%
they keep the same card it just gets
 
06:09:59.830 --> 06:09:59.840 align:start position:0%
reloaded follow
 
06:10:02.548 --> 06:10:02.558 align:start position:0%
up so then that does beg the question as
 
06:10:04.468 --> 06:10:04.478 align:start position:0%
far as the balance so if they if it's
 
06:10:07.788 --> 06:10:07.798 align:start position:0%
lost stolen the swipe card uh the reader
 
06:10:10.430 --> 06:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
doesn't um read or the the strip doesn't
 
06:10:13.190 --> 06:10:13.200 align:start position:0%
read anymore then the whole balance is
 
06:10:15.708 --> 06:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
gone not necessarily just one week's pay
 
06:10:17.628 --> 06:10:17.638 align:start position:0%
so they could be leaving they could be
 
06:10:19.270 --> 06:10:19.280 align:start position:0%
accumulating their balance week after
 
06:10:21.628 --> 06:10:21.638 align:start position:0%
week they could yes and if you're
 
06:10:23.468 --> 06:10:23.478 align:start position:0%
replacing a card that that full balance
 
06:10:26.310 --> 06:10:26.320 align:start position:0%
automatically transfers to the new card
 
06:10:28.350 --> 06:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
so no money is ever lost with these
 
06:10:29.868 --> 06:10:29.878 align:start position:0%
cards if that's but you know if they
 
06:10:32.070 --> 06:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
don't spend it then obviously it'll
 
06:10:37.150 --> 06:10:37.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:10:39.150 --> 06:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
you thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
06:10:40.910 --> 06:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
taking the question I'm just curious if
 
06:10:42.390 --> 06:10:42.400 align:start position:0%
somebody that doesn't have a bank
 
06:10:45.030 --> 06:10:45.040 align:start position:0%
account is there am I correct in
 
06:10:47.230 --> 06:10:47.240 align:start position:0%
thinking that there'd be no limits on
 
06:10:48.990 --> 06:10:49.000 align:start position:0%
maximum that they could put on the card
 
06:10:50.430 --> 06:10:50.440 align:start position:0%
could somebody just keep their whole
 
06:10:51.990 --> 06:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
life savings on these cards and just
 
06:10:54.190 --> 06:10:54.200 align:start position:0%
continue growing the amount on there and
 
06:10:55.990 --> 06:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
would it be a limit as far as I know
 
06:10:57.110 --> 06:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
there's no limit
 
06:11:07.070 --> 06:11:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:11:09.868 --> 06:11:09.878 align:start position:0%
that thank you for taking my
 
06:11:13.390 --> 06:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
question um replic will clerk brought up
 
06:11:14.750 --> 06:11:14.760 align:start position:0%
a good point and I just want to clarify
 
06:11:19.150 --> 06:11:19.160 align:start position:0%
this so uh the money so if I if I'm
 
06:11:20.788 --> 06:11:20.798 align:start position:0%
paying an employee I I put the money in
 
06:11:23.468 --> 06:11:23.478 align:start position:0%
a separate account it's probably not the
 
06:11:25.628 --> 06:11:25.638 align:start position:0%
right way to think of it but and then he
 
06:11:26.948 --> 06:11:26.958 align:start position:0%
they get the card and they just get to
 
06:11:28.468 --> 06:11:28.478 align:start position:0%
draw off the account for whatever the
 
06:11:29.868 --> 06:11:29.878 align:start position:0%
actual payroll
 
06:11:32.750 --> 06:11:32.760 align:start position:0%
was if a card gets lost and I have to
 
06:11:35.628 --> 06:11:35.638 align:start position:0%
replace it like he brought up but I'm
 
06:11:37.750 --> 06:11:37.760 align:start position:0%
not allowed to see the
 
06:11:39.830 --> 06:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
transactions from the employee how do I
 
06:11:41.788 --> 06:11:41.798 align:start position:0%
know how much money I actually owe the
 
06:11:44.590 --> 06:11:44.600 align:start position:0%
employee with what's left on the card um
 
06:11:46.350 --> 06:11:46.360 align:start position:0%
the employee is really not involved in
 
06:11:48.310 --> 06:11:48.320 align:start position:0%
that sort of transaction basically the
 
06:11:49.750 --> 06:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
employee comes to them and says there's
 
06:11:51.788 --> 06:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
a problem I just can't use the card for
 
06:11:53.948 --> 06:11:53.958 align:start position:0%
whatever reason the employer's response
 
06:11:55.430 --> 06:11:55.440 align:start position:0%
is here let me give you a new card
 
06:11:58.670 --> 06:11:58.680 align:start position:0%
instant issue it has the full balance of
 
06:12:00.990 --> 06:12:01.000 align:start position:0%
whatever was on your previous card there
 
06:12:02.830 --> 06:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
you go but they don't need to know the
 
06:12:04.548 --> 06:12:04.558 align:start position:0%
details of you know the account balance
 
06:12:06.750 --> 06:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
or anything like that they just the the
 
06:12:08.350 --> 06:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
replacement process automatically
 
06:12:10.548 --> 06:12:10.558 align:start position:0%
transfers the entire balance of the old
 
06:12:12.948 --> 06:12:12.958 align:start position:0%
card onto the new
 
06:12:15.628 --> 06:12:15.638 align:start position:0%
card okay so this it's probably just
 
06:12:16.548 --> 06:12:16.558 align:start position:0%
because I'm used to the old school
 
06:12:19.628 --> 06:12:19.638 align:start position:0%
payroll so it's not it's not one bank
 
06:12:21.670 --> 06:12:21.680 align:start position:0%
account that all the employees draw draw
 
06:12:23.948 --> 06:12:23.958 align:start position:0%
off of in theory it's a separate bank
 
06:12:25.948 --> 06:12:25.958 align:start position:0%
account for each individual employee yes
 
06:12:27.350 --> 06:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
yeah these accounts are are you know
 
06:12:29.948 --> 06:12:29.958 align:start position:0%
their FDIC insured up to the $250,000
 
06:12:31.628 --> 06:12:31.638 align:start position:0%
limit at the card holder level so each
 
06:12:35.230 --> 06:12:35.240 align:start position:0%
card holder has the FDIC insured account
 
06:12:37.350 --> 06:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
that's theirs it's a separate
 
06:12:41.030 --> 06:12:41.040 align:start position:0%
account okay sorry follow up so when I
 
06:12:43.670 --> 06:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
so if you issue a new card you're just
 
06:12:44.830 --> 06:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
you're not actually putting any you're
 
06:12:46.390 --> 06:12:46.400 align:start position:0%
not reloading the card or anything like
 
06:12:47.468 --> 06:12:47.478 align:start position:0%
that you're just actually just
 
06:12:48.910 --> 06:12:48.920 align:start position:0%
activating a new card and handing it to
 
06:12:55.350 --> 06:12:55.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:12:58.070 --> 06:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
you they slide put the number in and
 
06:13:01.390 --> 06:13:01.400 align:start position:0%
then you tell you want
 
06:13:25.350 --> 06:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:44.350 --> 06:13:44.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:13:49.150 --> 06:13:49.160 align:start position:0%
the so sorry and then if I lose mine and
 
06:13:51.468 --> 06:13:51.478 align:start position:0%
I ask you for a new car you can usually
 
06:13:53.270 --> 06:13:53.280 align:start position:0%
swipe it into something in your computer
 
06:13:54.390 --> 06:13:54.400 align:start position:0%
and you give it a new name and the
 
06:13:55.868 --> 06:13:55.878 align:start position:0%
person gets the card and the bank
 
06:13:57.830 --> 06:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
automat atically takes whatever money is
 
06:14:01.190 --> 06:14:01.200 align:start position:0%
left on that pay card that was destroyed
 
06:14:02.510 --> 06:14:02.520 align:start position:0%
and puts it to the new card now
 
06:14:03.910 --> 06:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
obviously there's some security codes
 
06:14:05.670 --> 06:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
and everything that has to be done
 
06:14:09.110 --> 06:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
but um that's just the way the procedure
 
06:14:10.788 --> 06:14:10.798 align:start position:0%
works I just see a lot of questions
 
06:14:12.390 --> 06:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
sorry sir it's your business but I think
 
06:14:15.190 --> 06:14:15.200 align:start position:0%
I know what the questions they're asking
 
06:14:18.468 --> 06:14:18.478 align:start position:0%
that was very helpful thank you um
 
06:14:21.110 --> 06:14:21.120 align:start position:0%
so it's one of the dispel some of those
 
06:14:22.548 --> 06:14:22.558 align:start position:0%
questions about you know you have to pay
 
06:14:24.150 --> 06:14:24.160 align:start position:0%
twice or
 
06:14:27.350 --> 06:14:27.360 align:start position:0%
whatever Mr avalani
 
06:14:29.030 --> 06:14:29.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and good to see
 
06:14:32.830 --> 06:14:32.840 align:start position:0%
you again um could you explain to me how
 
06:14:34.548 --> 06:14:34.558 align:start position:0%
I would activate a card if I don't have
 
06:14:37.110 --> 06:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
access to ADP system for your wisely
 
06:14:39.548 --> 06:14:39.558 align:start position:0%
card if I have a stack of cards sitting
 
06:14:42.230 --> 06:14:42.240 align:start position:0%
on my desk and hand an employee to new
 
06:14:44.110 --> 06:14:44.120 align:start position:0%
card how is that card activated when ADP
 
06:14:44.120 --> 06:14:45.030 align:start position:0%
card how is that card activated when ADP
is

06:14:45.030 --> 06:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
is
 
06:14:47.270 --> 06:14:47.280 align:start position:0%
closed so if you're the employer and
 
06:14:48.830 --> 06:14:48.840 align:start position:0%
you've got a stack of cards you need to
 
06:14:50.750 --> 06:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
activate a card basically the software
 
06:14:52.788 --> 06:14:52.798 align:start position:0%
will permit you to do that with your own
 
06:14:54.670 --> 06:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
credentials you would log into the ADP
 
06:14:56.868 --> 06:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
system and you know just tell it that
 
06:14:58.430 --> 06:14:58.440 align:start position:0%
you need to issue a card or replace a
 
06:14:59.990 --> 06:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
card and and feed the card into the
 
06:15:02.788 --> 06:15:02.798 align:start position:0%
reader and or swipe it and the software
 
06:15:03.948 --> 06:15:03.958 align:start position:0%
would just kind of walk you through how
 
06:15:06.910 --> 06:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:10.110 --> 06:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
that and every employee every customer
 
06:15:11.750 --> 06:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
that you have that issues pay cards
 
06:15:14.030 --> 06:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
every customer would be have those that
 
06:15:16.830 --> 06:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
equipment available at no
 
06:15:20.070 --> 06:15:20.080 align:start position:0%
cost um again I don't know if there's a
 
06:15:23.868 --> 06:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
specific cost of having a a batch of
 
06:15:25.190 --> 06:15:25.200 align:start position:0%
instant issue
 
06:15:27.868 --> 06:15:27.878 align:start position:0%
cards um so I I'm going to need to get
 
06:15:33.150 --> 06:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:36.670 --> 06:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
that I'm not sure if I got the question
 
06:15:39.750 --> 06:15:39.760 align:start position:0%
right when I get a debit card I have to
 
06:15:41.510 --> 06:15:41.520 align:start position:0%
activate it which means I have to call
 
06:15:44.350 --> 06:15:44.360 align:start position:0%
into the bank activate it um I can't see
 
06:15:47.708 --> 06:15:47.718 align:start position:0%
how a stack of cards on my desk handing
 
06:15:49.590 --> 06:15:49.600 align:start position:0%
it to a new employee logging into your
 
06:15:51.150 --> 06:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
system is going to activate that card
 
06:15:52.910 --> 06:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
and sweep everything over to him without
 
06:15:54.910 --> 06:15:54.920 align:start position:0%
somebody ADP pushing a button say okay
 
06:15:57.990 --> 06:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
this is okay and then how do I load the
 
06:16:00.310 --> 06:16:00.320 align:start position:0%
rest of his pay because he doesn't have
 
06:16:02.230 --> 06:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
access to it I'm mandated in 24 hours to
 
06:16:04.190 --> 06:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
pay that employee in cash or check or
 
06:16:06.670 --> 06:16:06.680 align:start position:0%
anything else how how does that work for
 
06:16:09.868 --> 06:16:09.878 align:start position:0%
the employer under lines 15 through
 
06:16:11.910 --> 06:16:11.920 align:start position:0%
22 because it's the same we've talked
 
06:16:13.750 --> 06:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
about the stb at least four times over
 
06:16:16.830 --> 06:16:16.840 align:start position:0%
the last two years maybe three years
 
06:16:19.708 --> 06:16:19.718 align:start position:0%
okay yeah I mean it is automated so you
 
06:16:20.990 --> 06:16:21.000 align:start position:0%
don't actually have to have somebody at
 
06:16:22.670 --> 06:16:22.680 align:start position:0%
ADP you don't have to talk to a person
 
06:16:24.708 --> 06:16:24.718 align:start position:0%
to to do this you actually just log into
 
06:16:27.310 --> 06:16:27.320 align:start position:0%
your ADP account as an employ employer
 
06:16:28.990 --> 06:16:29.000 align:start position:0%
and interact with the software to tell
 
06:16:32.468 --> 06:16:32.478 align:start position:0%
it what to do and it you know it can
 
06:16:36.230 --> 06:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:39.350 --> 06:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
day follow Mr chairman is there F
 
06:16:41.190 --> 06:16:41.200 align:start position:0%
protection for the employer if if an
 
06:16:43.030 --> 06:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
employee gets a hold of that system gets
 
06:16:45.350 --> 06:16:45.360 align:start position:0%
into that system and puts a card in for
 
06:16:47.070 --> 06:16:47.080 align:start position:0%
themselves and then funds it with
 
06:16:50.110 --> 06:16:50.120 align:start position:0%
$10,000 and then takes off is there any
 
06:16:53.510 --> 06:16:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
06:16:56.150 --> 06:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
employer um that is a good question I'm
 
06:16:57.590 --> 06:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
not really sure what the fraud
 
06:17:02.350 --> 06:17:02.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:17:05.430 --> 06:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
but yeah I'm not really sure how that
 
06:17:08.430 --> 06:17:08.440 align:start position:0%
works thank you um can we talk about the
 
06:17:11.390 --> 06:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
cards we can talk about the cards um the
 
06:17:14.948 --> 06:17:14.958 align:start position:0%
wisely cards have a whole host of fees
 
06:17:17.270 --> 06:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
associated with them um we were
 
06:17:19.070 --> 06:17:19.080 align:start position:0%
discussing about Merchant fees but we're
 
06:17:20.990 --> 06:17:21.000 align:start position:0%
also everybody was missing the
 
06:17:23.350 --> 06:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
transaction fees this wisely charge a
 
06:17:25.590 --> 06:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
transaction fee for each per each time
 
06:17:28.548 --> 06:17:28.558 align:start position:0%
that that card is used at an ATM is the
 
06:17:30.750 --> 06:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
person charged a transaction fee like a
 
06:17:34.150 --> 06:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
$3 transaction fee for using at an
 
06:17:37.030 --> 06:17:37.040 align:start position:0%
ATM um if you're using this at an ATM it
 
06:17:38.390 --> 06:17:38.400 align:start position:0%
depends whether it's in network or out
 
06:17:41.750 --> 06:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
of network so again um we encourage
 
06:17:44.350 --> 06:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
users to go into the bank and just go to
 
06:17:45.708 --> 06:17:45.718 align:start position:0%
the teller and say give me the What You
 
06:17:47.670 --> 06:17:47.680 align:start position:0%
Know full balance that's always free if
 
06:17:49.430 --> 06:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
you really wanted to use an ATM just you
 
06:17:51.270 --> 06:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
like an ATM you want to make sure that
 
06:17:53.150 --> 06:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
you're using an in network ATM and again
 
06:17:55.150 --> 06:17:55.160 align:start position:0%
you pull out your phone and say you know
 
06:17:57.708 --> 06:17:57.718 align:start position:0%
show me all the ATMs that are nearby
 
06:17:59.830 --> 06:17:59.840 align:start position:0%
that are free and as I just did There's
 
06:18:03.750 --> 06:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
you know 26 uh within a half mile here
 
06:18:06.430 --> 06:18:06.440 align:start position:0%
but um there are outof network ATMs that
 
06:18:07.628 --> 06:18:07.638 align:start position:0%
you know if you're just convenient
 
06:18:09.190 --> 06:18:09.200 align:start position:0%
because it's you're standing next to one
 
06:18:10.948 --> 06:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
and you want to use that ATM there may
 
06:18:13.708 --> 06:18:13.718 align:start position:0%
be a charge uh wisely uh for instance
 
06:18:16.910 --> 06:18:16.920 align:start position:0%
charges $1.75 to use an out of network
 
06:18:19.430 --> 06:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
ATM but it's a kind of a convenience fee
 
06:18:22.030 --> 06:18:22.040 align:start position:0%
is how we view
 
06:18:24.830 --> 06:18:24.840 align:start position:0%
it uh clarification Mr chairman yes is
 
06:18:27.708 --> 06:18:27.718 align:start position:0%
that the direct card or the pay card I'm
 
06:18:29.390 --> 06:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't quite hear is that the
 
06:18:31.070 --> 06:18:31.080 align:start position:0%
direct card or the pay card because I'm
 
06:18:32.788 --> 06:18:32.798 align:start position:0%
on your website looking at your fees and
 
06:18:35.670 --> 06:18:35.680 align:start position:0%
it's $3 for an hour out of network
 
06:18:40.230 --> 06:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
ATM um the P schedule that I have for
 
06:18:43.670 --> 06:18:43.680 align:start position:0%
wisely payroll cards is $175 for out of
 
06:18:45.948 --> 06:18:45.958 align:start position:0%
network ATMs so I'll I'll need to look
 
06:18:49.270 --> 06:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
into that and there's also an inactivity
 
06:18:51.788 --> 06:18:51.798 align:start position:0%
fee after 90 days with no transactions
 
06:18:53.390 --> 06:18:53.400 align:start position:0%
yes I understand that's a that's a feed
 
06:18:55.468 --> 06:18:55.478 align:start position:0%
that is charged there's no activity at
 
06:18:59.590 --> 06:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
all for 90 days there's a modest fee for
 
06:19:02.110 --> 06:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
that per
 
06:19:05.510 --> 06:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
month and if you want to Latitude Mr
 
06:19:08.110 --> 06:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
chairman if you wanted to reload um
 
06:19:09.230 --> 06:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
representative Drager brought up you
 
06:19:11.868 --> 06:19:11.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to reload your pay card with the
 
06:19:14.310 --> 06:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
paycheck from the employer there's also
 
06:19:16.868 --> 06:19:16.878 align:start position:0%
a charge of 5% of the check amount um
 
06:19:19.430 --> 06:19:19.440 align:start position:0%
there's no fee for loading you know for
 
06:19:21.590 --> 06:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
the employer just issuing payroll and
 
06:19:23.150 --> 06:19:23.160 align:start position:0%
reloading the card every week There's no
 
06:19:24.948 --> 06:19:24.958 align:start position:0%
charge to the employee for that that
 
06:19:26.948 --> 06:19:26.958 align:start position:0%
there is a Reload fee if you're taking a
 
06:19:28.468 --> 06:19:28.478 align:start position:0%
check from some other source like if
 
06:19:30.830 --> 06:19:30.840 align:start position:0%
your friend gives you a a check or you
 
06:19:32.310 --> 06:19:32.320 align:start position:0%
get a check from some you know the IRS
 
06:19:33.708 --> 06:19:33.718 align:start position:0%
or something like that if you want to
 
06:19:35.350 --> 06:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
take that check and convert it and put
 
06:19:37.708 --> 06:19:37.718 align:start position:0%
it onto your card um you go to a
 
06:19:38.948 --> 06:19:38.958 align:start position:0%
retailer and you can do that and there's
 
06:19:41.590 --> 06:19:41.600 align:start position:0%
a fee for that so yes there's a fee for
 
06:19:43.110 --> 06:19:43.120 align:start position:0%
cashing checks and putting them onto
 
06:19:43.120 --> 06:19:45.030 align:start position:0%
cashing checks and putting them onto
your

06:19:45.030 --> 06:19:45.040 align:start position:0%
your
 
06:19:47.948 --> 06:19:47.958 align:start position:0%
card so I say your employer outside of
 
06:19:50.310 --> 06:19:50.320 align:start position:0%
the pay card issue issues bonus checks
 
06:19:51.548 --> 06:19:51.558 align:start position:0%
at the end of the year and cuts checks
 
06:19:53.548 --> 06:19:53.558 align:start position:0%
out of his business yeah business
 
06:19:55.030 --> 06:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
account hands it to the employee the
 
06:19:56.708 --> 06:19:56.718 align:start position:0%
employee has to pay a doesn't have a
 
06:19:58.430 --> 06:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
bank account has to pay that 5% of the
 
06:20:00.468 --> 06:20:00.478 align:start position:0%
check amount to put it into his pay card
 
06:20:02.830 --> 06:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
in order to access those funds if the
 
06:20:04.430 --> 06:20:04.440 align:start position:0%
employer is issuing the payment say for
 
06:20:05.910 --> 06:20:05.920 align:start position:0%
an annual bonus or something like that
 
06:20:07.628 --> 06:20:07.638 align:start position:0%
typically they would just load the card
 
06:20:09.670 --> 06:20:09.680 align:start position:0%
directly and there's no fee for that if
 
06:20:11.390 --> 06:20:11.400 align:start position:0%
for some reason they want to hand out
 
06:20:14.750 --> 06:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
paper checks and the individual wants to
 
06:20:17.190 --> 06:20:17.200 align:start position:0%
take that paper check and convert it it
 
06:20:18.628 --> 06:20:18.638 align:start position:0%
sounds as though there may be a fee for
 
06:20:21.070 --> 06:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
that yes I can't imagine why people
 
06:20:25.390 --> 06:20:25.400 align:start position:0%
would do that thank you and um again I
 
06:20:26.310 --> 06:20:26.320 align:start position:0%
want to make make sure I have the right
 
06:20:28.670 --> 06:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
one there's also a decline fee at an ATM
 
06:20:30.310 --> 06:20:30.320 align:start position:0%
of a dollar so somebody doesn't have a
 
06:20:32.070 --> 06:20:32.080 align:start position:0%
balance enough balance at an ATM they
 
06:20:35.830 --> 06:20:35.840 align:start position:0%
would be charge a dollar no balance to
 
06:20:37.708 --> 06:20:37.718 align:start position:0%
for that fee they would technically be
 
06:20:40.948 --> 06:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
overdrawn right um yes I understand that
 
06:20:42.590 --> 06:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
is a fee that we're charging for
 
06:20:44.628 --> 06:20:44.638 align:start position:0%
declined transactions so somebody tries
 
06:20:45.788 --> 06:20:45.798 align:start position:0%
to make a transaction there's not enough
 
06:20:48.310 --> 06:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
money in the card rather than covering
 
06:20:50.070 --> 06:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
the transaction and then having an in
 
06:20:51.948 --> 06:20:51.958 align:start position:0%
you know an
 
06:20:56.468 --> 06:20:56.478 align:start position:0%
overdraft uh condition and ansf fee
 
06:20:57.990 --> 06:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
there's just a decline transaction fee
 
06:20:58.788 --> 06:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
of the
 
06:21:01.990 --> 06:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
dollar thank thank you and I have a few
 
06:21:04.070 --> 06:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
more if that's okay pardon I have a few
 
06:21:06.750 --> 06:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
more after he's done I let you want to
 
06:21:09.628 --> 06:21:09.638 align:start position:0%
go thank you uh riffing off of that if I
 
06:21:11.708 --> 06:21:11.718 align:start position:0%
have a total balance of
 
06:21:14.590 --> 06:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
$1999 on my payroll card how would I get
 
06:21:16.468 --> 06:21:16.478 align:start position:0%
that out of an ATM without incurring
 
06:21:17.788 --> 06:21:17.798 align:start position:0%
such a
 
06:21:20.190 --> 06:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
fee um right you'd walk into the bank
 
06:21:21.670 --> 06:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
and ask for the full balance on the card
 
06:21:23.670 --> 06:21:23.680 align:start position:0%
and they would hand it to you for no fee
 
06:21:25.510 --> 06:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
but um you really couldn't get cents out
 
06:21:28.548 --> 06:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
of of an ATM as you know so but you know
 
06:21:30.190 --> 06:21:30.200 align:start position:0%
and to your point there's a lot of
 
06:21:32.230 --> 06:21:32.240 align:start position:0%
sensitivity for you know what adverse
 
06:21:33.390 --> 06:21:33.400 align:start position:0%
impact on employees should they be
 
06:21:35.510 --> 06:21:35.520 align:start position:0%
required to pay fees you know again we
 
06:21:36.708 --> 06:21:36.718 align:start position:0%
would love to work with this committee
 
06:21:39.868 --> 06:21:39.878 align:start position:0%
to get this bill to where it wouldn't be
 
06:21:41.670 --> 06:21:41.680 align:start position:0%
um of concern that there's these
 
06:21:43.390 --> 06:21:43.400 align:start position:0%
sensitivities would be addressed you
 
06:21:44.750 --> 06:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
could do it in certain ways like you
 
06:21:46.548 --> 06:21:46.558 align:start position:0%
know you could make it effective for
 
06:21:48.468 --> 06:21:48.478 align:start position:0%
people who are hired after some future
 
06:21:50.430 --> 06:21:50.440 align:start position:0%
date which would make sure that you know
 
06:21:51.750 --> 06:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
employers don't go to all to their
 
06:21:53.310 --> 06:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
existing employees and say excuse me
 
06:21:55.670 --> 06:21:55.680 align:start position:0%
we're we're switching you all to payroll
 
06:21:58.230 --> 06:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
cards I mean mostly employers don't do
 
06:21:59.510 --> 06:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
that they they're they're sensitive to
 
06:22:01.468 --> 06:22:01.478 align:start position:0%
employees feelings and so forth they
 
06:22:02.868 --> 06:22:02.878 align:start position:0%
don't do that but you know we could do
 
06:22:04.990 --> 06:22:05.000 align:start position:0%
that if that would be help um we could
 
06:22:07.868 --> 06:22:07.878 align:start position:0%
also make um you know payroll cards or
 
06:22:10.270 --> 06:22:10.280 align:start position:0%
payroll checks an option at the request
 
06:22:12.270 --> 06:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
of the employee rather than because
 
06:22:14.070 --> 06:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
today in current law it's it's the
 
06:22:15.830 --> 06:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
default option if you don't do anything
 
06:22:17.230 --> 06:22:17.240 align:start position:0%
you don't provide your direct deposit
 
06:22:19.350 --> 06:22:19.360 align:start position:0%
bank account number if you don't
 
06:22:23.070 --> 06:22:23.080 align:start position:0%
authorize uh a a debit card you get a
 
06:22:25.548 --> 06:22:25.558 align:start position:0%
payer check uh so you know be willing
 
06:22:28.230 --> 06:22:28.240 align:start position:0%
willing to modify the bill to address
 
06:22:30.590 --> 06:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
those concerns to make you know uh paper
 
06:22:32.990 --> 06:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
checks available on request of the
 
06:22:38.670 --> 06:22:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:22:38.680 --> 06:22:40.830 align:start position:0%
 
concerns

06:22:40.830 --> 06:22:40.840 align:start position:0%
concerns
 
06:22:43.670 --> 06:22:43.680 align:start position:0%
follow so what specifically about paper
 
06:22:48.110 --> 06:22:48.120 align:start position:0%
checks is it that we are bad uh what
 
06:22:49.510 --> 06:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
what what's the problem with the paper
 
06:22:49.520 --> 06:22:51.190 align:start position:0%
what what's the problem with the paper
checks

06:22:51.190 --> 06:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
checks
 
06:22:53.628 --> 06:22:53.638 align:start position:0%
specifically paper checks especially um
 
06:22:56.110 --> 06:22:56.120 align:start position:0%
they're declining in volume you you
 
06:22:58.070 --> 06:22:58.080 align:start position:0%
you know have a a fairly expensive
 
06:23:00.830 --> 06:23:00.840 align:start position:0%
apparatus to administer papercheck
 
06:23:04.030 --> 06:23:04.040 align:start position:0%
printing delivery reconciliation dealing
 
06:23:06.628 --> 06:23:06.638 align:start position:0%
with lost and so and checks the fraud
 
06:23:08.670 --> 06:23:08.680 align:start position:0%
and so forth so they're very costly
 
06:23:11.190 --> 06:23:11.200 align:start position:0%
compared to electronic payments it's
 
06:23:13.110 --> 06:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
also um
 
06:23:15.310 --> 06:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
ineffective uh specifically for payment
 
06:23:17.548 --> 06:23:17.558 align:start position:0%
of wages when people can't get to the
 
06:23:19.350 --> 06:23:19.360 align:start position:0%
workplace to pick up their check and I'm
 
06:23:21.070 --> 06:23:21.080 align:start position:0%
not quite sure why that's acceptable and
 
06:23:23.670 --> 06:23:23.680 align:start position:0%
it really shouldn't be but that's those
 
06:23:28.150 --> 06:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:30.830 --> 06:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness so is it generally
 
06:23:32.510 --> 06:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
expensive to just write a check or is it
 
06:23:33.910 --> 06:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
just expensive if you're doing like a
 
06:23:36.910 --> 06:23:36.920 align:start position:0%
lot of checks and mailing out a lot of
 
06:23:39.390 --> 06:23:39.400 align:start position:0%
checks it's actually very expensive on a
 
06:23:40.788 --> 06:23:40.798 align:start position:0%
you know per check basis if you're just
 
06:23:42.468 --> 06:23:42.478 align:start position:0%
issuing a few which is what you know
 
06:23:43.910 --> 06:23:43.920 align:start position:0%
most businesses if they have 100
 
06:23:45.548 --> 06:23:45.558 align:start position:0%
employees and only three of them are
 
06:23:47.670 --> 06:23:47.680 align:start position:0%
still getting payroll checks it's kind
 
06:23:49.788 --> 06:23:49.798 align:start position:0%
of costly to deal with those few those
 
06:23:49.798 --> 06:23:53.150 align:start position:0%
of costly to deal with those few those
last

06:23:53.150 --> 06:23:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:23:56.110 --> 06:23:56.120 align:start position:0%
three so is that some so when I write a
 
06:23:58.708 --> 06:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
check it costs almost nothing is is
 
06:24:00.788 --> 06:24:00.798 align:start position:0%
there some part of law that prohibits
 
06:24:02.868 --> 06:24:02.878 align:start position:0%
employers from just writing a check for
 
06:24:09.230 --> 06:24:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:24:11.868 --> 06:24:11.878 align:start position:0%
scent I'm not sure how to respond to
 
06:24:13.868 --> 06:24:13.878 align:start position:0%
that um could you say that again I'm
 
06:24:17.110 --> 06:24:17.120 align:start position:0%
sorry so I understand that if you're M
 
06:24:18.990 --> 06:24:19.000 align:start position:0%
writing a lot of checks right like your
 
06:24:20.628 --> 06:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
ADP and you have to send paychecks out
 
06:24:21.948 --> 06:24:21.958 align:start position:0%
and you have to pay the postage on all
 
06:24:24.110 --> 06:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
that that's really expensive but if you
 
06:24:26.310 --> 06:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
just need to pay an employ employe and
 
06:24:27.430 --> 06:24:27.440 align:start position:0%
you just have one employee that you need
 
06:24:29.670 --> 06:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
to write a check it it can you see how
 
06:24:31.430 --> 06:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
it isn't actually that expensive just to
 
06:24:33.990 --> 06:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
write one check sure and this bill
 
06:24:35.548 --> 06:24:35.558 align:start position:0%
wouldn't preclude employers from
 
06:24:38.030 --> 06:24:38.040 align:start position:0%
offering paper checks if they wanted to
 
06:24:40.150 --> 06:24:40.160 align:start position:0%
it just gives them it doesn't require
 
06:24:42.468 --> 06:24:42.478 align:start position:0%
them to offer paper checks and again
 
06:24:45.390 --> 06:24:45.400 align:start position:0%
we're willing to you know work with the
 
06:24:47.990 --> 06:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
language to provide for paper checks for
 
06:24:50.430 --> 06:24:50.440 align:start position:0%
those people who really truly for
 
06:24:52.788 --> 06:24:52.798 align:start position:0%
whatever reason must have
 
06:24:56.990 --> 06:24:57.000 align:start position:0%
them thank you I have two questions and
 
06:24:58.430 --> 06:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
then I'm going to depart I have a
 
06:25:00.468 --> 06:25:00.478 align:start position:0%
meeting at 5:00 in Manchester and the
 
06:25:03.270 --> 06:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
vice chairman is going to take over
 
06:25:06.948 --> 06:25:06.958 align:start position:0%
um my I have uh one issue and one
 
06:25:08.750 --> 06:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
question the issue I have is really
 
06:25:11.948 --> 06:25:11.958 align:start position:0%
lines 15 through 19 and I'm going to
 
06:25:14.708 --> 06:25:14.718 align:start position:0%
read it here if an employee is unable to
 
06:25:16.708 --> 06:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
access their wages due to technical or
 
06:25:19.030 --> 06:25:19.040 align:start position:0%
processing defects the employer shall
 
06:25:20.670 --> 06:25:20.680 align:start position:0%
immediately don't like words like
 
06:25:23.468 --> 06:25:23.478 align:start position:0%
immediately in legislation okay because
 
06:25:24.590 --> 06:25:24.600 align:start position:0%
that that means a lot of things to
 
06:25:25.990 --> 06:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
different people immed immediately is
 
06:25:26.000 --> 06:25:26.868 align:start position:0%
different people immed immediately is
right

06:25:26.868 --> 06:25:26.878 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:25:31.750 --> 06:25:31.760 align:start position:0%
now or an hour or 24 hours what's
 
06:25:33.948 --> 06:25:33.958 align:start position:0%
immediately provide the wages employer
 
06:25:36.310 --> 06:25:36.320 align:start position:0%
their rep placement debit cards a check
 
06:25:39.548 --> 06:25:39.558 align:start position:0%
or direct deposit in such a situation
 
06:25:39.558 --> 06:25:40.430 align:start position:0%
or direct deposit in such a situation
the

06:25:40.430 --> 06:25:40.440 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:25:43.270 --> 06:25:43.280 align:start position:0%
employer shall be liable for late
 
06:25:45.430 --> 06:25:45.440 align:start position:0%
payment of
 
06:25:47.910 --> 06:25:47.920 align:start position:0%
wages and replacement wages provided
 
06:25:49.830 --> 06:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
after the designated
 
06:25:55.468 --> 06:25:55.478 align:start position:0%
payday I don't know why a fart by a
 
06:25:58.150 --> 06:25:58.160 align:start position:0%
financial institution or a pay card
 
06:26:01.310 --> 06:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
company or whatever becomes the
 
06:26:03.750 --> 06:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the
 
06:26:05.948 --> 06:26:05.958 align:start position:0%
employer and I don't know what the word
 
06:26:08.430 --> 06:26:08.440 align:start position:0%
shall be liable for means shall be
 
06:26:11.868 --> 06:26:11.878 align:start position:0%
liable for late payment of wages is that
 
06:26:14.948 --> 06:26:14.958 align:start position:0%
a fine by the New Hampshire do is that
 
06:26:18.390 --> 06:26:18.400 align:start position:0%
because my check to my my car payment
 
06:26:20.590 --> 06:26:20.600 align:start position:0%
that is automatically taken out of my
 
06:26:24.310 --> 06:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
debit card or my pay card bounced
 
06:26:26.350 --> 06:26:26.360 align:start position:0%
because the there was something with it
 
06:26:30.788 --> 06:26:30.798 align:start position:0%
so then I got a $25 fee so couple things
 
06:26:33.430 --> 06:26:33.440 align:start position:0%
in there are really a little too loosy
 
06:26:37.430 --> 06:26:37.440 align:start position:0%
Goosey here and I would really need a
 
06:26:40.670 --> 06:26:40.680 align:start position:0%
definition um and and someone to amend
 
06:26:43.990 --> 06:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
the bill to to find shall
 
06:26:47.910 --> 06:26:47.920 align:start position:0%
immediately um and shall be liable what
 
06:26:49.788 --> 06:26:49.798 align:start position:0%
what we're asking the employers to be
 
06:26:52.990 --> 06:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
liable employers to be liable
 
06:26:55.990 --> 06:26:56.000 align:start position:0%
for thank you understood
 
06:27:01.510 --> 06:27:01.520 align:start position:0%
secondly um ADP is the majority
 
06:27:04.150 --> 06:27:04.160 align:start position:0%
shareholder in Waverly
 
06:27:07.510 --> 06:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
correct with wisely wisely
 
06:27:11.150 --> 06:27:11.160 align:start position:0%
sorry um I don't know the answer to that
 
06:27:13.190 --> 06:27:13.200 align:start position:0%

06:27:18.350 --> 06:27:18.360 align:start position:0%
is thank you U um I'm sorry folks
 
06:27:22.510 --> 06:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
um um before you go since we've heard
 
06:27:25.150 --> 06:27:25.160 align:start position:0%
this bill before and we're more than an
 
06:27:26.468 --> 06:27:26.478 align:start position:0%
hour into
 
06:27:26.478 --> 06:27:28.230 align:start position:0%
hour into
it

06:27:28.230 --> 06:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:27:31.070 --> 06:27:31.080 align:start position:0%
um I'm I'm just wondering why we still
 
06:27:33.310 --> 06:27:33.320 align:start position:0%
have so many questions when it really is
 
06:27:35.830 --> 06:27:35.840 align:start position:0%
the same conversation the same questions
 
06:27:38.990 --> 06:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
the same details um I I don't know how
 
06:27:41.708 --> 06:27:41.718 align:start position:0%
to make that into a motion but I feel
 
06:27:45.270 --> 06:27:45.280 align:start position:0%
like we're kind of beating a dead horse
 
06:27:47.868 --> 06:27:47.878 align:start position:0%
here I appreciate your
 
06:27:50.990 --> 06:27:51.000 align:start position:0%
comments hure way we will hear the same
 
06:27:53.230 --> 06:27:53.240 align:start position:0%
way we're going to hear another 30
 
06:27:56.750 --> 06:27:56.760 align:start position:0%

06:28:02.468 --> 06:28:02.478 align:start position:0%
here and um this gentleman has come a
 
06:28:04.548 --> 06:28:04.558 align:start position:0%
long way and is taken a lot of questions
 
06:28:07.270 --> 06:28:07.280 align:start position:0%
I think um there's probably about 10
 
06:28:10.628 --> 06:28:10.638 align:start position:0%
more minutes left um I think I just made
 
06:28:13.468 --> 06:28:13.478 align:start position:0%
it longer it's okay no worries I I
 
06:28:15.270 --> 06:28:15.280 align:start position:0%
respect your du do that I'm going to I'm
 
06:28:18.150 --> 06:28:18.160 align:start position:0%
going to politely ask that the indulge
 
06:28:19.708 --> 06:28:19.718 align:start position:0%
of the committee for another 10 or so
 
06:28:23.430 --> 06:28:23.440 align:start position:0%
minutes uh make your uh questions um if
 
06:28:25.590 --> 06:28:25.600 align:start position:0%
that haven't already been asked uh you
 
06:28:27.230 --> 06:28:27.240 align:start position:0%
can also speak to the gentleman or
 
06:28:30.110 --> 06:28:30.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else after the hearing but uh for
 
06:28:32.070 --> 06:28:32.080 align:start position:0%
let the vice chairman get through uh the
 
06:28:33.310 --> 06:28:33.320 align:start position:0%
last few questions I think
 
06:28:34.868 --> 06:28:34.878 align:start position:0%
representative alalani has I think we'll
 
06:28:36.628 --> 06:28:36.638 align:start position:0%
wrap that
 
06:28:39.270 --> 06:28:39.280 align:start position:0%
up right all right have a good night
 
06:28:42.270 --> 06:28:42.280 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr
 
06:28:45.910 --> 06:28:45.920 align:start position:0%
CH up thank you Mr chairman um so and
 
06:28:48.670 --> 06:28:48.680 align:start position:0%
under page two line three why are we
 
06:28:52.230 --> 06:28:52.240 align:start position:0%
exempting um organized labor groups from
 
06:28:52.240 --> 06:28:53.910 align:start position:0%
exempting um organized labor groups from
this

06:28:53.910 --> 06:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
06:28:56.510 --> 06:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
process um I believe that was a request
 
06:28:57.830 --> 06:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
that was made so we're trying to be
 
06:28:59.670 --> 06:28:59.680 align:start position:0%
sensitive to um folks that have raised
 
06:29:02.510 --> 06:29:02.520 align:start position:0%
concerns and um it was suggested that
 
06:29:05.788 --> 06:29:05.798 align:start position:0%
organized labor shouldn't be um included
 
06:29:07.948 --> 06:29:07.958 align:start position:0%
in this bill they should be able to
 
06:29:09.590 --> 06:29:09.600 align:start position:0%
continue to negotiate their own terms
 
06:29:09.600 --> 06:29:15.548 align:start position:0%
continue to negotiate their own terms
and

06:29:15.548 --> 06:29:15.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:29:18.548 --> 06:29:18.558 align:start position:0%
conditions follow up follow up so we're
 
06:29:21.708 --> 06:29:21.718 align:start position:0%
exempting one section of um employees
 
06:29:23.510 --> 06:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
but we're forcing this on every private
 
06:29:26.628 --> 06:29:26.638 align:start position:0%
employer basically is what I I just
 
06:29:31.110 --> 06:29:31.120 align:start position:0%
heard um it relieves employers of um the
 
06:29:32.910 --> 06:29:32.920 align:start position:0%
particular responsibility of of having
 
06:29:34.868 --> 06:29:34.878 align:start position:0%
to issue paper pay payroll checks if
 
06:29:37.468 --> 06:29:37.478 align:start position:0%
they don't want to they they're clearly
 
06:29:39.468 --> 06:29:39.478 align:start position:0%
able to continue issuing paper checks if
 
06:29:42.230 --> 06:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
they prefer but it hopefully should make
 
06:29:44.270 --> 06:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
lives easier for the small businesses in
 
06:29:46.510 --> 06:29:46.520 align:start position:0%
in the
 
06:29:49.468 --> 06:29:49.478 align:start position:0%
state follow follow as a small business
 
06:29:52.830 --> 06:29:52.840 align:start position:0%
owner who reads this bill it does
 
06:29:56.910 --> 06:29:56.920 align:start position:0%
not and I've used a company in the
 
06:30:00.628 --> 06:30:00.638 align:start position:0%
past um as I read this bill this
 
06:30:03.590 --> 06:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
is adding responsibilities to the
 
06:30:05.468 --> 06:30:05.478 align:start position:0%
employer that do not need to be added to
 
06:30:06.830 --> 06:30:06.840 align:start position:0%
the employer if they've paid their
 
06:30:10.670 --> 06:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
employee on time um also exempting with
 
06:30:12.548 --> 06:30:12.558 align:start position:0%
the Indulgence of the chair also
 
06:30:14.590 --> 06:30:14.600 align:start position:0%
exempting other things tells me that
 
06:30:17.310 --> 06:30:17.320 align:start position:0%
there is a an issue with this that we're
 
06:30:21.350 --> 06:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
forcing certain segments to be you know
 
06:30:23.708 --> 06:30:23.718 align:start position:0%
rolled into payroll cause but we're
 
06:30:26.030 --> 06:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
exempting others so it's okay to write
 
06:30:28.708 --> 06:30:28.718 align:start position:0%
paper checks for union members but not
 
06:30:31.468 --> 06:30:31.478 align:start position:0%
for regular employees I'm
 
06:30:34.110 --> 06:30:34.120 align:start position:0%
just we're adding something to a bill
 
06:30:36.510 --> 06:30:36.520 align:start position:0%
that was brought back again so this is
 
06:30:39.230 --> 06:30:39.240 align:start position:0%
obviously a change that brought this
 
06:30:42.150 --> 06:30:42.160 align:start position:0%
again and from the last three times that
 
06:30:43.670 --> 06:30:43.680 align:start position:0%
I've had interactions with you over this
 
06:30:45.990 --> 06:30:46.000 align:start position:0%
bill we've changed nothing in section D
 
06:30:48.510 --> 06:30:48.520 align:start position:0%
to alleviate the issue for the
 
06:30:50.350 --> 06:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
employers okay that's a good point I
 
06:30:51.708 --> 06:30:51.718 align:start position:0%
think we've been trying to be very very
 
06:30:54.190 --> 06:30:54.200 align:start position:0%
careful about um not inconveniencing
 
06:30:56.830 --> 06:30:56.840 align:start position:0%
employees but it did add some burden to
 
06:30:58.708 --> 06:30:58.718 align:start position:0%
employers to make sure that they address
 
06:31:00.708 --> 06:31:00.718 align:start position:0%
these um you know points of failure and
 
06:31:02.310 --> 06:31:02.320 align:start position:0%
so forth here it's a good
 
06:31:06.590 --> 06:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
point we're happy to consider changes to
 
06:31:08.708 --> 06:31:08.718 align:start position:0%
this I will end there Mr chairman thank
 
06:31:11.868 --> 06:31:11.878 align:start position:0%
you all right other questions
 
06:31:11.878 --> 06:31:13.270 align:start position:0%
you all right other questions
representative

06:31:13.270 --> 06:31:13.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:31:15.830 --> 06:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
kill uh actually Mr chairman my question
 
06:31:16.708 --> 06:31:16.718 align:start position:0%
is for
 
06:31:19.948 --> 06:31:19.958 align:start position:0%
you uh whereas this the payroll cards
 
06:31:24.070 --> 06:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
are in use now and through Mr avani's
 
06:31:25.830 --> 06:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
testimony and other things that we've
 
06:31:27.750 --> 06:31:27.760 align:start position:0%
learned or do you think we should
 
06:31:30.270 --> 06:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
perhaps change this bill so it has more
 
06:31:32.788 --> 06:31:32.798 align:start position:0%
protections for the people who are being
 
06:31:35.270 --> 06:31:35.280 align:start position:0%
paid with payroll cards uh since we're
 
06:31:37.468 --> 06:31:37.478 align:start position:0%
learning more about the pitfalls and I'm
 
06:31:40.190 --> 06:31:40.200 align:start position:0%
not sure if uh people who are paid with
 
06:31:42.868 --> 06:31:42.878 align:start position:0%
payroll cards know all the
 
06:31:42.878 --> 06:31:44.948 align:start position:0%
payroll cards know all the
pitfalls

06:31:44.948 --> 06:31:44.958 align:start position:0%
pitfalls
 
06:31:48.150 --> 06:31:48.160 align:start position:0%
um as this bill has been submitted to
 
06:31:50.670 --> 06:31:50.680 align:start position:0%
our committee it is now our bill and if
 
06:31:54.388 --> 06:31:54.398 align:start position:0%
we have amendments to fix that we think
 
06:31:56.430 --> 06:31:56.440 align:start position:0%
we can fix the issues that were brought
 
06:31:58.948 --> 06:31:58.958 align:start position:0%
up here um we can work on
 
06:32:02.990 --> 06:32:03.000 align:start position:0%
that or we may determine as has happened
 
06:32:05.750 --> 06:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
in the past that it's it's beyond our
 
06:32:07.948 --> 06:32:07.958 align:start position:0%
ability to do within the time allotted
 
06:32:11.110 --> 06:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
and right we may not so that's perhaps
 
06:32:14.150 --> 06:32:14.160 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:18.548 --> 06:32:18.558 align:start position:0%
legislate well thank you perhaps yes are
 
06:32:21.388 --> 06:32:21.398 align:start position:0%
there other questions representative
 
06:32:24.788 --> 06:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
grer uh thank you so you mentioned uh
 
06:32:26.868 --> 06:32:26.878 align:start position:0%
employers requesting this how many
 
06:32:29.948 --> 06:32:29.958 align:start position:0%
employers are are demanding this change
 
06:32:33.110 --> 06:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
and um are they able to
 
06:32:36.430 --> 06:32:36.440 align:start position:0%
testify we we haven't asked um our
 
06:32:39.510 --> 06:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
clients to testify on this sort of Bill
 
06:32:41.468 --> 06:32:41.478 align:start position:0%
it's really not a big issue for any one
 
06:32:43.990 --> 06:32:44.000 align:start position:0%
employer it's kind of a big issue for
 
06:32:46.868 --> 06:32:46.878 align:start position:0%
the system overall but um if you ask any
 
06:32:48.670 --> 06:32:48.680 align:start position:0%
one employer that's not a big enough
 
06:32:50.670 --> 06:32:50.680 align:start position:0%
issue to take time to you know argue
 
06:32:51.830 --> 06:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
that well I really shouldn't have to
 
06:32:53.868 --> 06:32:53.878 align:start position:0%
issue paper payroll checks it's not that
 
06:32:56.590 --> 06:32:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
06:32:58.788 --> 06:32:58.798 align:start position:0%
Vantage thank
 
06:33:01.590 --> 06:33:01.600 align:start position:0%

the

06:33:06.230 --> 06:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
06:33:09.990 --> 06:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity there was a comment earlier
 
06:33:12.230 --> 06:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
representative McKenzie I I think you
 
06:33:17.868 --> 06:33:17.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:33:21.110 --> 06:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
okay I I most certainly
 
06:33:23.548 --> 06:33:23.558 align:start position:0%
do um
 
06:33:23.558 --> 06:33:25.150 align:start position:0%
do um
but

06:33:25.150 --> 06:33:25.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
06:33:27.590 --> 06:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
are there before we do that are there
 
06:33:30.230 --> 06:33:30.240 align:start position:0%
any other members of the audience that
 
06:33:32.670 --> 06:33:32.680 align:start position:0%
wished to testify and that was so we had
 
06:33:34.948 --> 06:33:34.958 align:start position:0%
one question for you but he
 
06:33:37.670 --> 06:33:37.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't it
 
06:33:40.590 --> 06:33:40.600 align:start position:0%
wasn't uh well it so representative
 
06:33:42.990 --> 06:33:43.000 align:start position:0%
Alani you had you wanted to bring up the
 
06:33:45.270 --> 06:33:45.280 align:start position:0%
if we were bringing the do up I I happy
 
06:33:47.110 --> 06:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
to ask question oh it's just for you
 
06:33:49.388 --> 06:33:49.398 align:start position:0%
thank you all right so give her a chance
 
06:33:52.548 --> 06:33:52.558 align:start position:0%
to get settled and and we can continue
 
06:33:55.110 --> 06:33:55.120 align:start position:0%
see that's why I didn't ask for the
 
06:33:55.120 --> 06:34:00.868 align:start position:0%
see that's why I didn't ask for the
sheets

06:34:00.868 --> 06:34:00.878 align:start position:0%
 
06:34:05.788 --> 06:34:05.798 align:start position:0%
yet hi all right so um I think this is a
 
06:34:08.628 --> 06:34:08.638 align:start position:0%
new bill so my name is Tracy mcra I am
 
06:34:10.788 --> 06:34:10.798 align:start position:0%
an attorney and legislative le as on for
 
06:34:12.910 --> 06:34:12.920 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of Labor
 
06:34:15.270 --> 06:34:15.280 align:start position:0%
and yes representative
 
06:34:17.350 --> 06:34:17.360 align:start position:0%
avalani thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
06:34:20.030 --> 06:34:20.040 align:start position:0%
Mr McGrath for taking the questions um
 
06:34:21.910 --> 06:34:21.920 align:start position:0%
seeing as this bill has been before us
 
06:34:25.510 --> 06:34:25.520 align:start position:0%
multiple times are you familiar with it
 
06:34:29.910 --> 06:34:29.920 align:start position:0%
once or twice I've read it yes um the
 
06:34:32.868 --> 06:34:32.878 align:start position:0%
yes follow up the chairman um infantine
 
06:34:34.990 --> 06:34:35.000 align:start position:0%
had asked a couple questions and those
 
06:34:36.430 --> 06:34:36.440 align:start position:0%
are the same questions as an employer I
 
06:34:38.750 --> 06:34:38.760 align:start position:0%
would have shall immediately provide
 
06:34:41.708 --> 06:34:41.718 align:start position:0%
wages and then shall be liable could you
 
06:34:43.430 --> 06:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
explain to the committee what those what
 
06:34:46.310 --> 06:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
what the do would it constru that as an
 
06:34:48.270 --> 06:34:48.280 align:start position:0%
employee being late with wages and with
 
06:34:50.868 --> 06:34:50.878 align:start position:0%
the law that is written now under
 
06:34:53.548 --> 06:34:53.558 align:start position:0%
275 so the current law basically puts
 
06:34:56.990 --> 06:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
the employer at as the person or entity
 
06:34:59.830 --> 06:34:59.840 align:start position:0%
primarily responsible for payment of
 
06:35:03.750 --> 06:35:03.760 align:start position:0%
wages they can hire other companies to
 
06:35:05.910 --> 06:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
pay the wages for them but the employer
 
06:35:08.750 --> 06:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
remains primarily responsible so in this
 
06:35:10.830 --> 06:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
particular case if the employer does not
 
06:35:13.030 --> 06:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
comply with current New Hampshire law in
 
06:35:15.910 --> 06:35:15.920 align:start position:0%
payment of these wages on time they can
 
06:35:19.230 --> 06:35:19.240 align:start position:0%
be held liable for late payment meaning
 
06:35:21.628 --> 06:35:21.638 align:start position:0%
that there would be potential civil
 
06:35:23.830 --> 06:35:23.840 align:start position:0%
penalties but payment would have to be
 
06:35:26.948 --> 06:35:26.958 align:start position:0%
issued there would likely be a hearing
 
06:35:29.190 --> 06:35:29.200 align:start position:0%
and then it would be up to uh a hearing
 
06:35:31.548 --> 06:35:31.558 align:start position:0%
officer to make any final designations
 
06:35:31.558 --> 06:35:32.510 align:start position:0%
officer to make any final designations
and

06:35:32.510 --> 06:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
06:35:35.590 --> 06:35:35.600 align:start position:0%
determinations follow um if it was found
 
06:35:37.990 --> 06:35:38.000 align:start position:0%
to be that it was outside of the
 
06:35:41.230 --> 06:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
employers doing technical issue on the
 
06:35:44.270 --> 06:35:44.280 align:start position:0%
issuing card company uh banking error
 
06:35:46.350 --> 06:35:46.360 align:start position:0%
something like that
 
06:35:49.868 --> 06:35:49.878 align:start position:0%
um with the do under how this bill is
 
06:35:51.388 --> 06:35:51.398 align:start position:0%
written go after the company that made
 
06:35:54.548 --> 06:35:54.558 align:start position:0%
the mistake no thank you thank you
 
06:35:58.190 --> 06:35:58.200 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you um now that she's up
 
06:36:02.628 --> 06:36:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
06:36:02.638 --> 06:36:05.548 align:start position:0%
 
question

06:36:05.548 --> 06:36:05.558 align:start position:0%
question
 
06:36:09.468 --> 06:36:09.478 align:start position:0%
than so the question I I had asked
 
06:36:12.948 --> 06:36:12.958 align:start position:0%
earlier um relates to the money in the
 
06:36:16.590 --> 06:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
bank at the time the payroll is executed
 
06:36:19.708 --> 06:36:19.718 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
06:36:23.270 --> 06:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
and that an employer could issue the
 
06:36:26.628 --> 06:36:26.638 align:start position:0%
checks or issue pay cards or issue some
 
06:36:29.388 --> 06:36:29.398 align:start position:0%
other vehicle for payment and what
 
06:36:30.990 --> 06:36:31.000 align:start position:0%
happens if they yank that money out
 
06:36:35.708 --> 06:36:35.718 align:start position:0%
before the before the any of this thing
 
06:36:38.150 --> 06:36:38.160 align:start position:0%
happens well I think that that's an
 
06:36:41.110 --> 06:36:41.120 align:start position:0%
issue that could theoretically happen in
 
06:36:45.190 --> 06:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
the current process of things um however
 
06:36:47.310 --> 06:36:47.320 align:start position:0%
there are ways for the employee to come
 
06:36:48.788 --> 06:36:48.798 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Labor and say that
