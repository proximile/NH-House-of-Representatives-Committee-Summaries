session first bill we're going to exec
 
00:15:14.550 --> 00:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
today I've I've got a list of some some
 
00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:16.360 align:start position:0%
of our bills are early bills because
 
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:17.800 align:start position:0%
they go to a second
 
00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:20.120 align:start position:0%
committee and just in case there's some
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
sort of unforeseen disaster here I'm
 
00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:25.639 align:start position:0%
going to take up the first early bills
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
uh but my intent is to get to all of
 
00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:31.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
first bill we're going to take up is HB
 
00:15:36.749 --> 00:15:36.759 align:start position:0%
1881 relative to making the state
 
00:15:39.069 --> 00:15:39.079 align:start position:0%
responsible for maintaining Opticon
 
00:15:42.269 --> 00:15:42.279 align:start position:0%
systems for fire and emergency on state
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
roads and making an
 
00:15:45.639 --> 00:15:48.590 align:start position:0%
roads and making an
appropriation

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:48.600 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:51.160 align:start position:0%
therefore recognize the clerk Mr
 
00:15:52.509 --> 00:15:52.519 align:start position:0%
chairman I move that the committee
 
00:15:55.309 --> 00:15:55.319 align:start position:0%
recommend itl for
 
00:15:59.870 --> 00:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
181 motion is to i
 
00:16:03.749 --> 00:16:03.759 align:start position:0%
TL 181 do I hear a second motion's been
 
00:16:06.350 --> 00:16:06.360 align:start position:0%
made and seconded let's start a little
 
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
discussion I'll begin I think uh most of
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
us were aware although this was a good
 
00:16:15.030 --> 00:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
bill intention we found out that there
 
00:16:18.470 --> 00:16:18.480 align:start position:0%
there was mostly a uh there's
 
00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.350 align:start position:0%
there was mostly a uh there's
already

00:16:20.350 --> 00:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
already
 
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:23.720 align:start position:0%
a system in place to do this and it
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
doesn't it it does not include every
 
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:29.120 align:start position:0%
town out there making it a blanket
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
assumption so if your your town wants to
 
00:16:37.069 --> 00:16:37.079 align:start position:0%
let hrvs and orvs and btls which is
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
short for bacon lettuce and tomatoes I'm
 
00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:42.000 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm sorry I'm on the Opticon
 
00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:43.560 align:start position:0%
system because actually they're both
 
00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:45.800 align:start position:0%
just about the same the Opticon system
 
00:16:50.430 --> 00:16:50.440 align:start position:0%
there is a system there already the do
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
allows the town to pick out the system
 
00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
that they want it provides the town that
 
00:16:59.550 --> 00:16:59.560 align:start position:0%
system and after that the
 
00:17:01.550 --> 00:17:01.560 align:start position:0%
town is responsible for the maintenance
 
00:17:04.230 --> 00:17:04.240 align:start position:0%
on it whether it is on a state road or
 
00:17:08.630 --> 00:17:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:11.240 align:start position:0%
discussions seeing none I'll ask the
 
00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:13.520 align:start position:0%

move
 
00:19:43.590 --> 00:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
OTP motion has been made is there a
 
00:19:46.789 --> 00:19:46.799 align:start position:0%
second second representative Jack has
 
00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:56.510 --> 00:19:56.520 align:start position:0%
Please Mr chair representative cluder
 
00:19:59.710 --> 00:19:59.720 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I know this will is an expense
 
00:20:01.390 --> 00:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
on the highway fund but this is one of
 
00:20:05.029 --> 00:20:05.039 align:start position:0%
the thank you represent Jack uh this is
 
00:20:07.710 --> 00:20:07.720 align:start position:0%
I think an important uh expense I mean
 
00:20:10.029 --> 00:20:10.039 align:start position:0%
that area is you know it's a very rural
 
00:20:12.029 --> 00:20:12.039 align:start position:0%
area there's a lot of tourists a lot of
 
00:20:15.190 --> 00:20:15.200 align:start position:0%
hikers and I think if we put in mile
 
00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:17.960 align:start position:0%
markers this maybe could avoid a tragedy
 
00:20:21.149 --> 00:20:21.159 align:start position:0%
where someone is lost and they trying to
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
and I know the cell service isn't very
 
00:20:25.669 --> 00:20:25.679 align:start position:0%
good either but it might help avert a
 
00:20:27.750 --> 00:20:27.760 align:start position:0%
tragedy and so I think it's well worth
 
00:20:29.230 --> 00:20:29.240 align:start position:0%
the money I think in according to the
 
00:20:30.909 --> 00:20:30.919 align:start position:0%
fiscal note of
 
00:20:34.870 --> 00:20:34.880 align:start position:0%
$287,600 so I Ur I will be voting yes
 
00:20:36.630 --> 00:20:36.640 align:start position:0%
and I urge the entire committee to vote
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
off to pass thank you representative
 
00:20:41.750 --> 00:20:41.760 align:start position:0%
Jack uh thank you Mr chairman uh just
 
00:20:42.990 --> 00:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
like to point out a couple things that
 
00:20:45.990 --> 00:20:46.000 align:start position:0%
we've noticed um on line four it says
 
00:20:49.230 --> 00:20:49.240 align:start position:0%
along the entire length of Route 112 and
 
00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really mean that it just
 
00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:52.720 align:start position:0%
means the Canam Mangus so the bill would
 
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:55.520 align:start position:0%
be improved uh if at some point that
 
00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
were amended away and then on the next
 
00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:00.919 align:start position:0%
line where it says intervals of one mile
 
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:03.320 align:start position:0%
it's the do standard to install them
 
00:21:06.390 --> 00:21:06.400 align:start position:0%
every .2 miles so if the finance
 
00:21:08.149 --> 00:21:08.159 align:start position:0%
committee were to see fit to appropriate
 
00:21:10.750 --> 00:21:10.760 align:start position:0%
the money to do every point2 they could
 
00:21:14.549 --> 00:21:14.559 align:start position:0%
potentially amend that to0 2 so noticed
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
thank you any other comments or
 
00:21:21.549 --> 00:21:21.559 align:start position:0%
questions uh I'll just just make my own
 
00:21:25.029 --> 00:21:25.039 align:start position:0%
uh once again normally this committee is
 
00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:27.039 align:start position:0%
very tight with its per strings except
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
around capital budget time
 
00:21:29.279 --> 00:21:30.310 align:start position:0%
around capital budget time
um

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:34.120 align:start position:0%
however I myself was simply appalled
 
00:21:36.549 --> 00:21:36.559 align:start position:0%
hearing the testimony from uh the
 
00:21:38.470 --> 00:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
gentleman that did that did the
 
00:21:40.750 --> 00:21:40.760 align:start position:0%
testimony for us that it had been
 
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:43.000 align:start position:0%
brought up at least three or four other
 
00:21:45.310 --> 00:21:45.320 align:start position:0%
times and had been turned down every
 
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:47.200 align:start position:0%
time I I just wish he had brought it to
 
00:21:49.590 --> 00:21:49.600 align:start position:0%
this committee first because this is
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
definitely a safety concern for all our
 
00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:53.600 align:start position:0%
citizens the fact that you break down
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's bad enough but you have to rely on
 
00:21:58.590 --> 00:21:58.600 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't improve the cell phone
 
00:22:00.669 --> 00:22:00.679 align:start position:0%
service but you have to rely on somebody
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
else driving by to stop and offer to
 
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
make a phone call as soon as they can so
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
the fact that they'll be able to
 
00:22:11.669 --> 00:22:11.679 align:start position:0%
identify exactly where that car is is a
 
00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:14.600 align:start position:0%
is a great help and uh I agree and urge
 
00:22:18.029 --> 00:22:18.039 align:start position:0%
us all to vote Yes uh any other
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
questions or
 
00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:21.960 align:start position:0%
comments seeing none clerk could call
 
00:22:23.190 --> 00:22:23.200 align:start position:0%

discussion representative cludia Mr
 
00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:49.720 align:start position:0%
chair um I talked to the sponsor who
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
wasn't here and I as you may remember
 
00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:53.640 align:start position:0%
introduced the bill on his behalf
 
00:24:55.710 --> 00:24:55.720 align:start position:0%
because he was absent for some reason
 
00:24:57.630 --> 00:24:57.640 align:start position:0%
and I asked him why didn't you
 
00:24:59.350 --> 00:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
investigate the issue further reach out
 
00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:01.480 align:start position:0%
to for our former chair representative
 
00:25:03.350 --> 00:25:03.360 align:start position:0%
makoni and he didn't I don't know I
 
00:25:05.029 --> 00:25:05.039 align:start position:0%
couldn't he didn't give me a good answer
 
00:25:07.950 --> 00:25:07.960 align:start position:0%
and I asked him why don't you any Carol
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
County rep so I just have a problem with
 
00:25:13.269 --> 00:25:13.279 align:start position:0%
that and he didn't he was a bit vague as
 
00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
far as what kind of railroads Freight
 
00:25:17.789 --> 00:25:17.799 align:start position:0%
passenger whatever and he said I guess
 
00:25:21.510 --> 00:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh the ver few railroads would be you
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
know everything so I just wish it needs
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
more clarity before I could even support
 
00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
but since it's been something that we
 
00:25:30.630 --> 00:25:30.640 align:start position:0%
have done already I just think itl is
 
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:32.840 align:start position:0%
appropriate in this case thank you thank
 
00:25:34.830 --> 00:25:34.840 align:start position:0%

375 I move inexpedient to legislate and
 
00:28:47.710 --> 00:28:47.720 align:start position:0%
I will second that motion motion has
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
been made and seconded we are now open
 
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:53.880 align:start position:0%
for discussion and I will lead off by
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
following up on my original comment that
 
00:28:58.269 --> 00:28:58.279 align:start position:0%
there is already
 
00:28:58.279 --> 00:29:01.870 align:start position:0%
there is already
a

00:29:01.870 --> 00:29:01.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:05.830 --> 00:29:05.840 align:start position:0%
uh wow amazing how it's amazing how you
 
00:29:07.669 --> 00:29:07.679 align:start position:0%
can just clam up immediately there's
 
00:29:12.389 --> 00:29:12.399 align:start position:0%
already a process in in place to go
 
00:29:16.630 --> 00:29:16.640 align:start position:0%
ahead and if any Town wants to have
 
00:29:19.710 --> 00:29:19.720 align:start position:0%
ohrv vehicles on their public highways
 
00:29:22.070 --> 00:29:22.080 align:start position:0%
there's a way to do it I don't believe
 
00:29:24.509 --> 00:29:24.519 align:start position:0%
it is necessary to have a blanket way to
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
do it that would include automatically
 
00:29:28.669 --> 00:29:28.679 align:start position:0%
include all
 
00:29:31.310 --> 00:29:31.320 align:start position:0%
towns so is there any further discussion
 
00:29:33.750 --> 00:29:33.760 align:start position:0%
or comments Mr chairman yes
 
00:29:36.669 --> 00:29:36.679 align:start position:0%
representative C I decided I opposing
 
00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:38.720 align:start position:0%
this bill because I had an email from a
 
00:29:41.389 --> 00:29:41.399 align:start position:0%
con Claremont constituent who was very
 
00:29:43.230 --> 00:29:43.240 align:start position:0%
unhappy even with the present law and he
 
00:29:44.870 --> 00:29:44.880 align:start position:0%
said the city council is now allowing
 
00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:46.760 align:start position:0%
snowmobile and he lives in a very rural
 
00:29:48.710 --> 00:29:48.720 align:start position:0%
area of Claremont through his property
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
or his neighborhood he and his neighbors
 
00:29:52.149 --> 00:29:52.159 align:start position:0%
are upset because I told him that's the
 
00:29:54.149 --> 00:29:54.159 align:start position:0%
president of law go to the city council
 
00:29:56.310 --> 00:29:56.320 align:start position:0%
but that sort of inspired me that this
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
and some other emails that I think we
 
00:29:59.590 --> 00:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
could be opening a can of worms so
 
00:30:02.909 --> 00:30:02.919 align:start position:0%
that's why I support itl on this
 
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:05.360 align:start position:0%
bill any other

please representative

Faulkner thank you chairman agree with
 
00:32:17.070 --> 00:32:17.080 align:start position:0%
the recommendation I think that we've
 
00:32:19.549 --> 00:32:19.559 align:start position:0%
always had a policy of not picking out
 
00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:21.909 align:start position:0%
always had a policy of not picking out
individual

00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
individual
 
00:32:23.909 --> 00:32:23.919 align:start position:0%
projects other than you know some
 
00:32:25.149 --> 00:32:25.159 align:start position:0%
extreme circumstances like we saw
 
00:32:28.029 --> 00:32:28.039 align:start position:0%
earlier this morning outside of the uh
 
00:32:31.029 --> 00:32:31.039 align:start position:0%
the the context of considering all
 
00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:33.799 align:start position:0%
projects for the 10year plan uh and I
 
00:32:35.310 --> 00:32:35.320 align:start position:0%
think there this illustrates a good
 
00:32:36.789 --> 00:32:36.799 align:start position:0%
reason for that is
 
00:32:39.110 --> 00:32:39.120 align:start position:0%
that those projects have already gone
 
00:32:42.430 --> 00:32:42.440 align:start position:0%
through a comparison and Analysis of
 
00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:45.840 align:start position:0%
cost Effectiveness comparison of the
 
00:32:48.149 --> 00:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
with competing projects and they're
 
00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
placed in a certain priority order based
 
00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.200 align:start position:0%
upon these objective facts and this is a
 
00:32:54.509 --> 00:32:54.519 align:start position:0%
project that hasn't gone through that
 
00:32:54.519 --> 00:32:55.350 align:start position:0%
project that hasn't gone through that
and

00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:57.549 --> 00:32:57.559 align:start position:0%
therefore I think if we're going to list
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
uh consider it at all it needs to be
 
00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
needs to go through the 10-year plan
 
00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
process so I will support
 
00:33:08.190 --> 00:33:08.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:11.110 --> 00:33:11.120 align:start position:0%
comments representative Boyd thank you
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman and I'll be brief I will be
 
00:33:17.310 --> 00:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
opposing itl uh on the simple fact that
 
00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:19.880 align:start position:0%
the bill seeks to solve a problem that
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
is impacting my particular community and
 
00:33:24.389 --> 00:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh while I am cognizant of
 
00:33:27.909 --> 00:33:27.919 align:start position:0%
Representative faa's comments um I also
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
would draw our attention to the
 
00:33:31.909 --> 00:33:31.919 align:start position:0%
testimony that was provided last week in
 
00:33:34.669 --> 00:33:34.679 align:start position:0%
support of House Bill 578 and I will
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
leave it at that thank you Mr chairman
 
00:33:39.269 --> 00:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
thank you any other questions or
 
00:33:41.669 --> 00:33:41.679 align:start position:0%
comments representative jurus thank you
 
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:45.320 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh when it comes to widening
 
00:33:49.350 --> 00:33:49.360 align:start position:0%
highways and Roads uh you and the impact
 
00:33:54.110 --> 00:33:54.120 align:start position:0%
on on the property abutters uh the abuts
 
00:33:55.230 --> 00:33:55.240 align:start position:0%
understand and they know that when they
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
purchase something near a you know near
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
a highway or rail line that uh there's
 
00:34:00.350 --> 00:34:00.360 align:start position:0%
going to be some noise but as you
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
encroach even closer uh and you you take
 
00:34:07.909 --> 00:34:07.919 align:start position:0%
down you know trees and change the uh
 
00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:11.320 align:start position:0%
change the landscape at the very least
 
00:34:14.430 --> 00:34:14.440 align:start position:0%
there should be a bit more of a barrier
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
something installed as part of the
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
project perhaps it this these belong in
 
00:34:19.629 --> 00:34:19.639 align:start position:0%
the 10-year plan but there should be
 
00:34:21.829 --> 00:34:21.839 align:start position:0%
something like at the very least a six
 
00:34:24.069 --> 00:34:24.079 align:start position:0%
foot chain link I noticed that there are
 
00:34:25.990 --> 00:34:26.000 align:start position:0%
some 4ft chain link fences out there
 
00:34:27.790 --> 00:34:27.800 align:start position:0%
right now on the Everett but something
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
that would at least provide a barrier
 
00:34:33.750 --> 00:34:33.760 align:start position:0%
for some security and uh and privacy uh
 
00:34:36.149 --> 00:34:36.159 align:start position:0%
even though it's not won it won't be an
 
00:34:39.149 --> 00:34:39.159 align:start position:0%
aoic or you know reflective of acoustic
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
uh road noise uh that's at the very
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
least I think should be considered when
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
it comes to these efforts to widen uh
 
00:34:49.190 --> 00:34:49.200 align:start position:0%
Lanes on the on the Turn Pike thank you
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for your
 
00:34:53.349 --> 00:34:53.359 align:start position:0%
comments uh just uh rather than have the
 
00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:55.960 align:start position:0%
do respond to this I believe that the
 
00:34:58.230 --> 00:34:58.240 align:start position:0%
chain link fences that you see are put
 
00:35:01.870 --> 00:35:01.880 align:start position:0%
in normally for uh to keep animals and
 
00:35:03.390 --> 00:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
things like that off the side of the
 
00:35:05.630 --> 00:35:05.640 align:start position:0%
road uh what we're talking about as far
 
00:35:08.390 --> 00:35:08.400 align:start position:0%
as the sound barriers every time the
 
00:35:12.550 --> 00:35:12.560 align:start position:0%
dot widens or adjusts the width of a
 
00:35:15.150 --> 00:35:15.160 align:start position:0%
road for any reason they do go through
 
00:35:18.230 --> 00:35:18.240 align:start position:0%
the environmental impact study and that
 
00:35:21.230 --> 00:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
is when all the uh all the in their
 
00:35:23.710 --> 00:35:23.720 align:start position:0%
opinion that is when all the communities
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
that are deemed necessary get the sound
 
00:35:29.589 --> 00:35:29.599 align:start position:0%
barriers so these two were deemed not
 
00:35:31.150 --> 00:35:31.160 align:start position:0%
necessary there I believe there were
 
00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
four that were deemed necessary I think
 
00:35:37.710 --> 00:35:37.720 align:start position:0%
the do did it's due diligence and uh I
 
00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:39.720 align:start position:0%
am going to support the
 
00:35:42.870 --> 00:35:42.880 align:start position:0%

561 motion to retain has been made do I
 
00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.240 align:start position:0%

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.270 --> 00:37:54.280 align:start position:0%
bone we are now open for discussion Mr
 
00:37:56.270 --> 00:37:56.280 align:start position:0%
and comments representative cluder yes
 
00:37:58.630 --> 00:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
I'd like to speak to my motion
 
00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:02.480 align:start position:0%
I have asking that we retain this bill
 
00:38:05.550 --> 00:38:05.560 align:start position:0%
because among other things I'm I'm the
 
00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:07.280 align:start position:0%
long I guess the dean of this committee
 
00:38:09.950 --> 00:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
the longest serving member and I would
 
00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
like to and I would maybe if we could
 
00:38:13.750 --> 00:38:13.760 align:start position:0%
get some other committee members to get
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
I would like to go down to maram at
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
least visit Continental Boulevard I've
 
00:38:19.710 --> 00:38:19.720 align:start position:0%
never been on the site and I want to get
 
00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
a better understanding of the road and
 
00:38:25.230 --> 00:38:25.240 align:start position:0%
and maybe talk with some marac residents
 
00:38:26.950 --> 00:38:26.960 align:start position:0%
this is going to be a very difficult
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
bill and I don't know probably in the
 
00:38:30.790 --> 00:38:30.800 align:start position:0%
end maybe people aren't going to be
 
00:38:32.589 --> 00:38:32.599 align:start position:0%
happy with what the majority of this
 
00:38:34.430 --> 00:38:34.440 align:start position:0%
committee does but if we go into or if I
 
00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:36.800 align:start position:0%
go into battle to support itl I want to
 
00:38:39.470 --> 00:38:39.480 align:start position:0%
at least listen to the other side and
 
00:38:41.470 --> 00:38:41.480 align:start position:0%
see what's going on in that area this is
 
00:38:45.349 --> 00:38:45.359 align:start position:0%
a very difficult issue but I think if we
 
00:38:47.390 --> 00:38:47.400 align:start position:0%
retain it we can look at the issue
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
further and I don't know take a vote the
 
00:38:52.230 --> 00:38:52.240 align:start position:0%
other way and take a vote one way or the
 
00:38:53.910 --> 00:38:53.920 align:start position:0%
other and then we may have to deal with
 
00:38:56.790 --> 00:38:56.800 align:start position:0%
this again in in the 10-year plan uh we
 
00:38:58.829 --> 00:38:58.839 align:start position:0%
do have an agreement though for 5 years
 
00:39:01.390 --> 00:39:01.400 align:start position:0%
that we're not going to impose anything
 
00:39:04.109 --> 00:39:04.119 align:start position:0%
on uh marac without their consent at
 
00:39:05.750 --> 00:39:05.760 align:start position:0%
this present time but I think at a
 
00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:07.200 align:start position:0%
certain point we're going to have
 
00:39:08.550 --> 00:39:08.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to have to negotiate with
 
00:39:09.910 --> 00:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
us and we're going to try to have to
 
00:39:11.550 --> 00:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
come to some sort of agreement so going
 
00:39:13.510 --> 00:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
down for a visit to Continental
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
Boulevard at least would be I might be
 
00:39:18.069 --> 00:39:18.079 align:start position:0%
helpful in the process thank you
 
00:39:20.030 --> 00:39:20.040 align:start position:0%
representative bone thank you Mr
 
00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
chairman I know K bouard very well I
 
00:39:26.430 --> 00:39:26.440 align:start position:0%
used to work on there and remember when
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
it was first open
 
00:39:31.750 --> 00:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
but in more case other than Continental
 
00:39:34.510 --> 00:39:34.520 align:start position:0%
Boulevard it's also any road and I'm
 
00:39:37.349 --> 00:39:37.359 align:start position:0%
concerned about most other towns I think
 
00:39:39.550 --> 00:39:39.560 align:start position:0%
we need to look at this because for
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
example 3A in Lichfield is a state road
 
00:39:46.589 --> 00:39:46.599 align:start position:0%
but not in Manchester or in Hudson so
 
00:39:48.510 --> 00:39:48.520 align:start position:0%
can the state just say hey that now
 
00:39:50.829 --> 00:39:50.839 align:start position:0%
belongs to you we have another road in
 
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:53.640 align:start position:0%
litfield Hill Crest that's also a state
 
00:39:56.270 --> 00:39:56.280 align:start position:0%
road that pretty much is one of the
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
throughways to go from litfield to to
 
00:40:03.030 --> 00:40:03.040 align:start position:0%
londondary and that's an agreement which
 
00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
we have where we do the winter
 
00:40:07.630 --> 00:40:07.640 align:start position:0%
maintenance and the state does the
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
summer maintenance but yeah I don't want
 
00:40:11.870 --> 00:40:11.880 align:start position:0%
I think other towns have the same
 
00:40:14.589 --> 00:40:14.599 align:start position:0%
problem is all of a sudden we don't want
 
00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:17.200 align:start position:0%
dot saying that row is now yours so I
 
00:40:19.349 --> 00:40:19.359 align:start position:0%
think it retaining and we need to look
 
00:40:19.359 --> 00:40:20.190 align:start position:0%
think it retaining and we need to look
at

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:20.200 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:40:24.270 --> 00:40:24.280 align:start position:0%
it robes fauler thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:40:25.829 --> 00:40:25.839 align:start position:0%
I think retain makes a lot of sense
 
00:40:27.390 --> 00:40:27.400 align:start position:0%
there a couple pieces of information
 
00:40:29.670 --> 00:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
that when we get them we'll make it
 
00:40:31.630 --> 00:40:31.640 align:start position:0%
easier I think to come to a satisfactory
 
00:40:34.589 --> 00:40:34.599 align:start position:0%
Solution on this and one is the general
 
00:40:37.870 --> 00:40:37.880 align:start position:0%
uh the the study of road tolls and other
 
00:40:40.430 --> 00:40:40.440 align:start position:0%
funding mechanisms one of the big
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
stumbling points on this is how we pay
 
00:40:45.550 --> 00:40:45.560 align:start position:0%
for the or how we did pay for
 
00:40:51.270 --> 00:40:51.280 align:start position:0%
this uh and uh also the resolution of a
 
00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
electronic tolling policy which may uh
 
00:40:57.470 --> 00:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
may change as a result of that that St
 
00:40:59.750 --> 00:40:59.760 align:start position:0%
also I think
 
00:41:02.309 --> 00:41:02.319 align:start position:0%
um I think we have time because of this
 
00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:04.000 align:start position:0%
compromise last year and I think that we
 
00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:06.040 align:start position:0%
should take advantage of that and wait
 
00:41:07.550 --> 00:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
for better information to see if we can
 
00:41:09.829 --> 00:41:09.839 align:start position:0%
get a a solution that's more
 
00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
satisfactory to all thank
 
00:41:14.230 --> 00:41:14.240 align:start position:0%
you any other questions or comments
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
representative Jack uh thank you Mr
 
00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
chairman I have a question there's some
 
00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity about where the state
 
00:41:23.190 --> 00:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
owned part of Continental Boulevard ends
 
00:41:26.670 --> 00:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
at the South toward toward pachuk Square
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
I wonder if someone from the dot or
 
00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:31.640 align:start position:0%
maybe someone from marac knows exactly
 
00:41:33.829 --> 00:41:33.839 align:start position:0%
where the southern boundary of the state
 
00:41:35.309 --> 00:41:35.319 align:start position:0%
owned portion
 
00:41:38.750 --> 00:41:38.760 align:start position:0%
is representative boy you nailed it pen
 
00:41:41.349 --> 00:41:41.359 align:start position:0%
square right at the intersection of of
 
00:41:44.109 --> 00:41:44.119 align:start position:0%
uh continental and business 101 so
 
00:41:46.829 --> 00:41:46.839 align:start position:0%
followup follow so even though that part
 
00:41:48.670 --> 00:41:48.680 align:start position:0%
of the road is named Camp Sergeant it's
 
00:41:51.190 --> 00:41:51.200 align:start position:0%
still stay own do you
 
00:41:53.630 --> 00:41:53.640 align:start position:0%
think Camp Sergeant crosses the road
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
Camp Sergeant's not a camp Sergeant
 
00:41:58.510 --> 00:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
comes across the road Camp Sergeant runs
 
00:42:04.349 --> 00:42:04.359 align:start position:0%
north from exit exit 12 circles down and
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
actually becomes a part very briefly
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
from where the M marac Village Water
 
00:42:15.230 --> 00:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
District building is located running
 
00:42:18.790 --> 00:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
South towards towards pachuk Square it
 
00:42:20.750 --> 00:42:20.760 align:start position:0%
then Cuts back
 
00:42:25.430 --> 00:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
in at the next at the next satellites um
 
00:42:27.710 --> 00:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
just beyond not the Fidelity
 
00:42:29.750 --> 00:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
intersection and the subdivision that's
 
00:42:32.309 --> 00:42:32.319 align:start position:0%
in there but just beyond there so that
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
portion of of Camp Sergeant Road was
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
absorbed by Continental Boulevard when
 
00:42:40.109 --> 00:42:40.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
