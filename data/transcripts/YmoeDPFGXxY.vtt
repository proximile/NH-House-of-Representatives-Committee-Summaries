00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 align:start position:0%
a leftover room I have a pothole under
 
00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
this chair it's actually there is the
 
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
the splash plate does not have any
 
00:05:55.189 --> 00:05:55.199 align:start position:0%
screws left in it we don't have a screw
 
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 align:start position:0%
loose we have no screws so
 
00:05:58.500 --> 00:05:59.210 align:start position:0%
loose we have no screws so
um

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:01.500 align:start position:0%
the other thing is another committee is
 
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740 align:start position:0%
coming in this afternoon so we were told
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
we got to be out of here by 12 30. so
 
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 align:start position:0%
when it comes to debates discussions and
 
00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:14.240 align:start position:0%
so on uh say your peace but make a brief
 
00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:17.699 align:start position:0%
one bill is a hearing on 475 that's
 
00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:20.580 align:start position:0%
scheduled for 9 30. the rest are exacts
 
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
which are scheduled for 10 15 and
 
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 align:start position:0%
onwards if you write the blurb
 
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:28.560 align:start position:0%
we have to have it before you leave
 
00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 align:start position:0%
because it has to be passed along for
 
00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
committee services to deal with so
 
00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
that doesn't mean everybody be bashful
 
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 align:start position:0%
and nobody volunteered to do it it just
 
00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:45.800 align:start position:0%
means Say Say What You Need to Say
 
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
and turn it in I have to edit it there's
 
00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
a few things that they don't like like
 
00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:52.620 align:start position:0%
it is a well-known fact that and
 
00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 align:start position:0%
everybody else is a who disagrees
 
00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 align:start position:0%
with me I have to change that
 
00:06:59.390 --> 00:06:59.400 align:start position:0%
I might believe it but I can't say it
 
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:04.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
supposed to write idiot
 
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 align:start position:0%
you're pushing no maybe not you really
 
00:07:11.749 --> 00:07:11.759 align:start position:0%
you know what I mean you have to say we
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
believe that okay
 
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
and just one final thing when we do exec
 
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
some bills
 
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:21.300 align:start position:0%
and I say something like the motion
 
00:07:23.990 --> 00:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
before us is itl is moved by so and so
 
00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
and second and by so and so at that
 
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
point if you're not in the room you
 
00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:29.460 align:start position:0%
don't get to vote that's when the
 
00:07:32.089 --> 00:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
question is called so you'll sense the
 
00:07:34.670 --> 00:07:34.680 align:start position:0%
rhythm of it and very often if you just
 
00:07:38.029 --> 00:07:38.039 align:start position:0%
gotta go out the best time to do is
 
00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:40.620 align:start position:0%
right after we have just finished
 
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:42.840 align:start position:0%
executing because it'll take a little
 
00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:45.000 align:start position:0%
while in discussion before we get to the
 
00:07:46.969 --> 00:07:46.979 align:start position:0%
next vote so that's that's probably the
 
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:49.560 align:start position:0%
best time to leave if you have to any
 
00:07:53.689 --> 00:07:53.699 align:start position:0%
questions on procedures for today
 
00:07:53.699 --> 00:07:55.430 align:start position:0%
questions on procedures for today
okay

00:07:55.430 --> 00:07:55.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:07:59.290 --> 00:07:59.300 align:start position:0%
I open the hearing on House Bill
 
00:08:03.110 --> 00:08:03.120 align:start position:0%

I knew that but I have to say that
 
00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:15.720 align:start position:0%

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:17.520 align:start position:0%

00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:19.919 align:start position:0%
I know I've been here seven years and
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%

submit evidence and testimony in Family
 
00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:46.860 align:start position:0%
Court proceedings it provides family
 
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:49.200 align:start position:0%
with an equal opportunity to present
 
00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:51.120 align:start position:0%
their evidence and testimony to the
 
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:53.160 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court Family Division
 
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:55.920 align:start position:0%
our state rules of civil procedures lays
 
00:08:57.470 --> 00:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
down The rules that should be followed
 
00:09:00.050 --> 00:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
by the state district court and civil
 
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.190 align:start position:0%
by the state district court and civil
actions

00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
actions
 
00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
however for many for many of the family
 
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:04.630 align:start position:0%
however for many for many of the family
court

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:04.640 align:start position:0%
court
 
00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
it is not following these civil
 
00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:10.140 align:start position:0%
procedures that allows both parties to
 
00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:13.260 align:start position:0%
submit evidence and testimony I ask how
 
00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:15.240 align:start position:0%
is the court making these life-altering
 
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:17.220 align:start position:0%
decisions for families when they are
 
00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
only allowing one party to submit
 
00:09:21.590 --> 00:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
evidence or testimony
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
with all the concerns in the Circuit
 
00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:26.760 align:start position:0%
Court division as legislators we have an
 
00:09:28.670 --> 00:09:28.680 align:start position:0%
obligation to the people to put good
 
00:09:31.670 --> 00:09:31.680 align:start position:0%
language in place and with the passage
 
00:09:33.769 --> 00:09:33.779 align:start position:0%
of this bill our families will have an
 
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:37.140 align:start position:0%
opportunity that is fair balanced for
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
both parties and will have the potential
 
00:09:42.889 --> 00:09:42.899 align:start position:0%
for reduced Stress and Anxiety on
 
00:09:46.009 --> 00:09:46.019 align:start position:0%
families and the court I ask that you
 
00:09:48.769 --> 00:09:48.779 align:start position:0%
vote HB 475
 
00:09:51.970 --> 00:09:51.980 align:start position:0%
ought to pass in the event you don't
 
00:09:54.949 --> 00:09:54.959 align:start position:0%
pass it I would like to ask that it be
 
00:09:54.959 --> 00:09:56.930 align:start position:0%
pass it I would like to ask that it be
retained

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
retained
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
any questions representative Raymond
 
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:07.620 align:start position:0%
have you done something to it yes I was
 
00:10:09.530 --> 00:10:09.540 align:start position:0%
thinking this might be more effective
 
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:11.820 align:start position:0%
I'm excited about it well done sorry
 
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
everyone I'm usually in the corner where
 
00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300 align:start position:0%
he cannot see me and I have to like wave
 
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
anyways thank you so much for being here
 
00:10:18.530 --> 00:10:18.540 align:start position:0%
this morning representative post
 
00:10:21.110 --> 00:10:21.120 align:start position:0%
um hopefully you had a safe drive and
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
um I wondered if you could explain a
 
00:10:25.310 --> 00:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
little bit more about the current
 
00:10:27.710 --> 00:10:27.720 align:start position:0%
process in Family Division I know a lot
 
00:10:31.070 --> 00:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
about how dcyf cases work but I don't
 
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
know as much about divorces and so when
 
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:36.480 align:start position:0%
I read your bill I thought well can't
 
00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:38.220 align:start position:0%
people submit evidence so if you could
 
00:10:40.130 --> 00:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
just take a couple minutes to walk us
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
through who can and who can't submit
 
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:44.820 align:start position:0%
evidence that would be helpful to me
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
so the issue at hand is sometimes they
 
00:10:50.509 --> 00:10:50.519 align:start position:0%
will take evidence for one and not the
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
other and so parties are disenfranchised
 
00:10:57.889 --> 00:10:57.899 align:start position:0%
when they don't have the ability to have
 
00:11:02.690 --> 00:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
that heard uh so this the the change in
 
00:11:05.389 --> 00:11:05.399 align:start position:0%
this is um
 
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:07.740 align:start position:0%
right here enact establishing evidence
 
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
and testimony in Family Court
 
00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:11.030 align:start position:0%
and testimony in Family Court
proceedings

00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
proceedings
 
00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
um and let me go to this part where
 
00:11:14.220 --> 00:11:15.350 align:start position:0%
um and let me go to this part where
um

00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
the person has a right to present
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
evidence where they did not have a right
 
00:11:25.130 --> 00:11:25.140 align:start position:0%
before so this is how it changes that
 
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.160 align:start position:0%
um so giving them the right
 
00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:31.980 align:start position:0%
allows both parties to
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
um submit that information
 
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:37.500 align:start position:0%
and they're also in this
 
00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.170 align:start position:0%
and they're also in this
um

00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:39.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:42.230 --> 00:11:42.240 align:start position:0%
on the the back of this um this right
 
00:11:44.750 --> 00:11:44.760 align:start position:0%
this right shall not be limited by the
 
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:47.160 align:start position:0%
presiding judge magistrate or marital
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
master or by the New Hampshire Rules of
 
00:11:51.290 --> 00:11:51.300 align:start position:0%
Evidence or the rules of the Circuit
 
00:11:54.889 --> 00:11:54.899 align:start position:0%
Court Family Division this court shall
 
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.000 align:start position:0%
note in the record of the proceedings
 
00:11:59.810 --> 00:11:59.820 align:start position:0%
any evidence not admitted into the
 
00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:02.040 align:start position:0%
record including the specific evidence
 
00:12:05.269 --> 00:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
or testimony not admitted and the reason
 
00:12:08.569 --> 00:12:08.579 align:start position:0%
why it was not admitted this is this is
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
a way to show if they haven't accepted
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
it why
 
00:12:16.910 --> 00:12:16.920 align:start position:0%
um so for for many people that are
 
00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:20.040 align:start position:0%
struggling to present evidence it
 
00:12:23.569 --> 00:12:23.579 align:start position:0%
becomes a big frustration and and
 
00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
it it is not fair they need to look at
 
00:12:30.069 --> 00:12:30.079 align:start position:0%
both sides to both people to make sure
 
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
that they have the evidence they need to
 
00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:36.360 align:start position:0%
make the decisions that are best for the
 
00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:37.490 align:start position:0%
make the decisions that are best for the
child

00:12:37.490 --> 00:12:37.500 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:40.740 align:start position:0%
and best for the family so I hope that
 
00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
answers your question
 
00:12:47.629 --> 00:12:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr uh Vice chairman um
 
00:12:53.210 --> 00:12:53.220 align:start position:0%
so what about evidence that is generally
 
00:12:56.170 --> 00:12:56.180 align:start position:0%
would be inadmissible
 
00:12:59.750 --> 00:12:59.760 align:start position:0%
is there because this is taking away the
 
00:13:02.750 --> 00:13:02.760 align:start position:0%
discretion of the presiding judge
 
00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.490 align:start position:0%
discretion of the presiding judge
so

00:13:04.490 --> 00:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
how would we protect against just though
 
00:13:09.410 --> 00:13:09.420 align:start position:0%
I don't think it takes it away from the
 
00:13:11.329 --> 00:13:11.339 align:start position:0%
presiding judge because if he decides
 
00:13:13.790 --> 00:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
not to do it all he has to do is list
 
00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:15.779 align:start position:0%
why he's not doing it well it's like
 
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
this right shall not be limited by the
 
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:24.300 align:start position:0%
in the in the bill
 
00:13:26.690 --> 00:13:26.700 align:start position:0%
or marital master or by the New
 
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:28.260 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Rules of Evidence right it
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
does say that but it does give them it
 
00:13:32.629 --> 00:13:32.639 align:start position:0%
does give them an opportunity in this
 
00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:35.820 align:start position:0%
bill where it says the court shall note
 
00:13:37.490 --> 00:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
in the record of the proceedings any
 
00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:39.420 align:start position:0%
evidence not admitted into the record
 
00:13:41.389 --> 00:13:41.399 align:start position:0%
including the specific evidence or
 
00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:45.360 align:start position:0%
testimony not admit not admitted and the
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
reason why it is uh was not admitted so
 
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:51.420 align:start position:0%
I believe that is the opening for the
 
00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:54.360 align:start position:0%
judges to be abled or the magistrate in
 
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
order to be able to do that they just
 
00:13:58.970 --> 00:13:58.980 align:start position:0%
have to record it but it but it is our
 
00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:00.779 align:start position:0%
hope that they will accept as much
 
00:14:03.410 --> 00:14:03.420 align:start position:0%
evidence as they possibly can because
 
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:05.820 align:start position:0%
how can how can they really make a
 
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:08.940 align:start position:0%
decision when one side is allowed to
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
present and the other is not
 
00:14:15.050 --> 00:14:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.970 --> 00:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
representative Greg
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:14:19.850 --> 00:14:19.860 align:start position:0%
being here today
 
00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:22.260 align:start position:0%
second that I
 
00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:24.360 align:start position:0%
I am concerned about the language and
 
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:27.180 align:start position:0%
and basically what she said I I don't
 
00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:29.760 align:start position:0%
see how these two don't conflict because
 
00:14:32.629 --> 00:14:32.639 align:start position:0%
when we're telling a judge you shall not
 
00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:35.459 align:start position:0%
but then we say but if you do right then
 
00:14:36.829 --> 00:14:36.839 align:start position:0%
you have to do this I don't understand
 
00:14:39.769 --> 00:14:39.779 align:start position:0%
how they are not in complete conflict or
 
00:14:43.090 --> 00:14:43.100 align:start position:0%
which one overrules the other
 
00:14:46.730 --> 00:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
if we can if we need another word to
 
00:14:49.550 --> 00:14:49.560 align:start position:0%
change it but because they are not doing
 
00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
it they are not following it that's why
 
00:14:55.910 --> 00:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
we chose the word shall but but we put
 
00:14:58.850 --> 00:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
in there that I I hate to say it it's an
 
00:14:58.860 --> 00:14:59.990 align:start position:0%
in there that I I hate to say it it's an
out

00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:00.000 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:01.620 align:start position:0%
um because I don't really want that to
 
00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:05.100 align:start position:0%
be an out but in in cases where there's
 
00:15:08.930 --> 00:15:08.940 align:start position:0%
a reason for it a a reason why they are
 
00:15:12.590 --> 00:15:12.600 align:start position:0%
not accepting it I I think that gives
 
00:15:16.730 --> 00:15:16.740 align:start position:0%
the judge the ability to know that they
 
00:15:18.050 --> 00:15:18.060 align:start position:0%
should take it if
 
00:15:22.129 --> 00:15:22.139 align:start position:0%
if there's a reason not to right
 
00:15:24.889 --> 00:15:24.899 align:start position:0%
um and if there is a good reason they
 
00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:27.779 align:start position:0%
have the ability to make this choice of
 
00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:29.940 align:start position:0%
putting it in the record representative
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
post is somewhat of a linguist and
 
00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:34.980 align:start position:0%
basically a word snob
 
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I would have liked unless on the
 
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
occasion when that this is what is the
 
00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:41.870 align:start position:0%
occasion when that this is what is the
default

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:41.880 align:start position:0%
default
 
00:15:45.350 --> 00:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
it's assumed don't assume when you can
 
00:15:47.870 --> 00:15:47.880 align:start position:0%
State and what I'm going to suggest is
 
00:15:50.810 --> 00:15:50.820 align:start position:0%
after the hearing is over you run I want
 
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
to keep this one from being exact right
 
00:15:55.970 --> 00:15:55.980 align:start position:0%
away okay to give you a chance to go
 
00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.180 align:start position:0%
down to OLS and make some changes not
 
00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:03.240 align:start position:0%
just this one but any other changes that
 
00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:04.980 align:start position:0%
may suggest themselves during this
 
00:16:07.850 --> 00:16:07.860 align:start position:0%
hearing okay and then and sit there with
 
00:16:09.290 --> 00:16:09.300 align:start position:0%
them while they do it and let them know
 
00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:11.940 align:start position:0%
they have please until noon and then
 
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:16.320 align:start position:0%
once it is approved by them you have to
 
00:16:18.530 --> 00:16:18.540 align:start position:0%
approve it and then you have to let
 
00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
committee Services know that you've done
 
00:16:23.569 --> 00:16:23.579 align:start position:0%
it so they will produce the copy so the
 
00:16:25.310 --> 00:16:25.320 align:start position:0%
copies will come down here you miss one
 
00:16:27.110 --> 00:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
of those steps this doesn't happen Okay
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
okay so you you make the changes you
 
00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:33.120 align:start position:0%
like you go to OLS they show you their
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
work product on Deadline you if you
 
00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:38.160 align:start position:0%
approve it you approve it and you tell
 
00:16:40.670 --> 00:16:40.680 align:start position:0%
them specifically intentionally send it
 
00:16:42.829 --> 00:16:42.839 align:start position:0%
to committee services run up to the
 
00:16:45.230 --> 00:16:45.240 align:start position:0%
fourth floor and wait for them to print
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
it out bring the copies down here and
 
00:16:49.129 --> 00:16:49.139 align:start position:0%
then we can exec it that doesn't
 
00:16:51.889 --> 00:16:51.899 align:start position:0%
guarantee we'll pass it but right now I
 
00:16:54.710 --> 00:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
think the word confusion in here is
 
00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:57.540 align:start position:0%
enough to keep us from doing that
 
00:17:01.790 --> 00:17:01.800 align:start position:0%
so unless where do you want that to be
 
00:17:04.549 --> 00:17:04.559 align:start position:0%
changed that's your problem it has to
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
say in effect
 
00:17:09.590 --> 00:17:09.600 align:start position:0%
generally speaking you must and if you
 
00:17:12.289 --> 00:17:12.299 align:start position:0%
do not you have to do that it has to be
 
00:17:14.289 --> 00:17:14.299 align:start position:0%
one of those has to be logical
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone
 
00:17:22.130 --> 00:17:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:25.610 --> 00:17:25.620 align:start position:0%
Gwen I am reading this bill I am reading
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
and you being a linguist will I hope
 
00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:31.140 align:start position:0%
understand I'd like you to correct me if
 
00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:31.909 align:start position:0%
understand I'd like you to correct me if
I'm

00:17:31.909 --> 00:17:31.919 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
00:17:34.990 --> 00:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
on not understanding the bill please
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
the bill is about
 
00:17:37.919 --> 00:17:39.590 align:start position:0%
the bill is about
um

00:17:39.590 --> 00:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:43.700 align:start position:0%
the news section is a right to present
 
00:17:48.110 --> 00:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
evidence and every person who goes into
 
00:17:48.120 --> 00:17:49.190 align:start position:0%
evidence and every person who goes into
the

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:17:53.270 --> 00:17:53.280 align:start position:0%
courtroom has a right to present the
 
00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start position:0%
evidence and
 
00:17:57.710 --> 00:17:57.720 align:start position:0%
so forth that goes on that the judge or
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
magistrate shall accept the evidence
 
00:18:03.289 --> 00:18:03.299 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:18:05.810 --> 00:18:05.820 align:start position:0%
it says this right shall not be limited
 
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.070 align:start position:0%
it says this right shall not be limited
right

00:18:07.070 --> 00:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you follow up please follow
 
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
up thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
00:18:13.310 --> 00:18:13.320 align:start position:0%
again for the follow-up
 
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
but to correct the um misunderstandings
 
00:18:22.909 --> 00:18:22.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
the court shall note
 
00:18:29.570 --> 00:18:29.580 align:start position:0%
in the record of proceedings any
 
00:18:33.830 --> 00:18:33.840 align:start position:0%
evidence not admitted
 
00:18:37.490 --> 00:18:37.500 align:start position:0%
into the record is that correct
 
00:18:40.970 --> 00:18:40.980 align:start position:0%
I believe so because if if the court is
 
00:18:43.010 --> 00:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
not taking it
 
00:18:46.070 --> 00:18:46.080 align:start position:0%
they have to record that they have not
 
00:18:49.310 --> 00:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
taken one final follow-up one more thank
 
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:52.260 align:start position:0%
you so is it true that what you're
 
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
saying is
 
00:18:59.090 --> 00:18:59.100 align:start position:0%
Mr Miss Ms judge or magistrate
 
00:19:03.289 --> 00:19:03.299 align:start position:0%
these people have a right to present
 
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:05.520 align:start position:0%
but if you don't accept it into the
 
00:19:10.250 --> 00:19:10.260 align:start position:0%
record you shall make a record as to why
 
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
is that the difference in the two
 
00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.610 align:start position:0%
is that the difference in the two
paragraphs

00:19:16.610 --> 00:19:16.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:18.660 align:start position:0%
is that the difference yes I believe it
 
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
is present and the
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
not putting it in the record is that
 
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.650 align:start position:0%
not putting it in the record is that
true

00:19:24.650 --> 00:19:24.660 align:start position:0%
true
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
00:19:33.230 --> 00:19:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:19:36.169 --> 00:19:36.179 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative uh just
 
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:37.320 align:start position:0%
further note if you're going to do an
 
00:19:40.130 --> 00:19:40.140 align:start position:0%
amendment uh Judiciary historically we
 
00:19:42.289 --> 00:19:42.299 align:start position:0%
start in January of the following year
 
00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:44.460 align:start position:0%
so you may want to look at the effective
 
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:47.460 align:start position:0%
date so we want to do 2024. I believe
 
00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
it's January of yes 2024. okay we will
 
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:52.320 align:start position:0%
do that uh and a question earlier you
 
00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:54.960 align:start position:0%
said that uh oftentimes
 
00:19:57.169 --> 00:19:57.179 align:start position:0%
um that the judge takes evidence from
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
one party and not the other is that on
 
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
the same issue do you know
 
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
um like if it's issue a and uh I pers
 
00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:09.660 align:start position:0%
the judge accepts my evidence but my ex
 
00:20:12.049 --> 00:20:12.059 align:start position:0%
he doesn't accept any evidence from her
 
00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760 align:start position:0%
on is it on the same issue or is it just
 
00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
under different issues where they'll
 
00:20:21.049 --> 00:20:21.059 align:start position:0%
accept from one party and not you know
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
consistently from the other party
 
00:20:26.029 --> 00:20:26.039 align:start position:0%
I believe that to be true where it comes
 
00:20:27.529 --> 00:20:27.539 align:start position:0%
from one and not the other and that's
 
00:20:30.409 --> 00:20:30.419 align:start position:0%
the real part of okay so not necessarily
 
00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
why we need this to get in okay great
 
00:20:35.510 --> 00:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:20:37.490 --> 00:20:37.500 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a question for
 
00:20:41.330 --> 00:20:41.340 align:start position:0%
representative post the prime sponsor
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
he's saying none thank you so much the
 
00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:45.539 align:start position:0%
chair now recognizes representative
 
00:20:47.510 --> 00:20:47.520 align:start position:0%
ulery he says he has a caucus at 10
 
00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.409 align:start position:0%
ulery he says he has a caucus at 10
o'clock

00:20:48.409 --> 00:20:48.419 align:start position:0%
o'clock
 
00:20:48.419 --> 00:20:53.930 align:start position:0%
o'clock
so

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:55.850 --> 00:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
you know it's a tough burden to be
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:04.970 --> 00:21:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you my name is Jordan ulery
 
00:21:06.890 --> 00:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
representing Hillsborough 13 which is
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
Hudson New Hampshire I'm a co-sponsor on
 
00:21:11.270 --> 00:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
this bill some of the questions that
 
00:21:14.150 --> 00:21:14.160 align:start position:0%
have been brought up are appropriate
 
00:21:16.370 --> 00:21:16.380 align:start position:0%
but it's the questions that come up to
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
the representatives across the state
 
00:21:21.710 --> 00:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
Regarding why wasn't I allowed
 
00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:23.880 align:start position:0%
well a lot of people don't understand
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
how the court system operates
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
disconnected system of common law where
 
00:21:34.730 --> 00:21:34.740 align:start position:0%
you can say anything you want in
 
00:21:36.590 --> 00:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
statutory law which says that you have
 
00:21:39.529 --> 00:21:39.539 align:start position:0%
to follow this set of rules
 
00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:42.480 align:start position:0%
when you're dealing with family law yes
 
00:21:45.169 --> 00:21:45.179 align:start position:0%
I think you guys know
 
00:21:48.110 --> 00:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
you have to explain to everybody in a
 
00:21:50.330 --> 00:21:50.340 align:start position:0%
good fashion in a well so they
 
00:21:52.970 --> 00:21:52.980 align:start position:0%
understand it if this person
 
00:21:56.750 --> 00:21:56.760 align:start position:0%
person a cannot accept
 
00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220 align:start position:0%
or cannot present what they feel is
 
00:22:02.029 --> 00:22:02.039 align:start position:0%
evidence and then the judge just says no
 
00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:04.020 align:start position:0%
because the judge knows what the process
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
is and what's going on the opposition
 
00:22:08.930 --> 00:22:08.940 align:start position:0%
may have an attorney and knows what the
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
pro what the situation is but the other
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
party is sitting there going why not
 
00:22:16.430 --> 00:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
he presented his financials I'm
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
presenting financial information but it
 
00:22:21.230 --> 00:22:21.240 align:start position:0%
wasn't the wrong format it was from a
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
different source
 
00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559 align:start position:0%
so by allowing them to present the
 
00:22:25.559 --> 00:22:27.950 align:start position:0%
so by allowing them to present the
information

00:22:27.950 --> 00:22:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:30.529 --> 00:22:30.539 align:start position:0%
and then get an explanation as to why
 
00:22:30.539 --> 00:22:32.750 align:start position:0%
and then get an explanation as to why
not

00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:22:36.950 --> 00:22:36.960 align:start position:0%
both parties in a very emotional very
 
00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:40.580 align:start position:0%
sensitive situation get to understand
 
00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:44.280 align:start position:0%
what happened and how to correct it
 
00:22:45.950 --> 00:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
of course
 
00:22:49.130 --> 00:22:49.140 align:start position:0%
as I'm sure the member from the bar
 
00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:51.240 align:start position:0%
association will quote Abraham Lincoln
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
had perhaps the best quote regarding an
 
00:22:58.090 --> 00:22:58.100 align:start position:0%
attorney and attending Court Pro Se
 
00:23:00.950 --> 00:23:00.960 align:start position:0%
the person who represents himself has a
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
fool for a client
 
00:23:05.930 --> 00:23:05.940 align:start position:0%
but not everybody can afford even though
 
00:23:09.169 --> 00:23:09.179 align:start position:0%
there are alternative payment sources so
 
00:23:12.409 --> 00:23:12.419 align:start position:0%
I would urge passage of this uh the
 
00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:14.400 align:start position:0%
recommendation of language of course the
 
00:23:16.370 --> 00:23:16.380 align:start position:0%
bills and the committee's control they
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
can handle it any way they want you do
 
00:23:21.529 --> 00:23:21.539 align:start position:0%
have retention available for you it's
 
00:23:24.830 --> 00:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
not uh something it's not part of the
 
00:23:26.510 --> 00:23:26.520 align:start position:0%
budget so we don't have to worry about
 
00:23:29.630 --> 00:23:29.640 align:start position:0%
that kind of activity but
 
00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:30.350 align:start position:0%
that kind of activity but
um

00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:33.590 --> 00:23:33.600 align:start position:0%
this is the type of thing that sits well
 
00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
with a section of the population that
 
00:23:41.330 --> 00:23:41.340 align:start position:0%
goes before court and has essentially
 
00:23:43.490 --> 00:23:43.500 align:start position:0%
some of their parental rights
 
00:23:46.190 --> 00:23:46.200 align:start position:0%
taken from them and they need to know
 
00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:48.529 align:start position:0%
taken from them and they need to know
why

00:23:48.529 --> 00:23:48.539 align:start position:0%
why
 
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:50.820 align:start position:0%
I've been around here long enough
 
00:23:53.510 --> 00:23:53.520 align:start position:0%
couple of you more than a couple a few
 
00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:55.320 align:start position:0%
of you have been around long enough to
 
00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
know that we've had impeachment cases
 
00:24:00.529 --> 00:24:00.539 align:start position:0%
come before the general court and the
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
reason for the impeachment
 
00:24:05.090 --> 00:24:05.100 align:start position:0%
or the cost for the impeachment was
 
00:24:09.649 --> 00:24:09.659 align:start position:0%
precisely this a lack of understanding a
 
00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
being discriminated against
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
of course feelings are each individuals
 
00:24:21.770 --> 00:24:21.780 align:start position:0%
and you have no control over them are of
 
00:24:24.409 --> 00:24:24.419 align:start position:0%
or other people's feelings but you can
 
00:24:27.049 --> 00:24:27.059 align:start position:0%
make it better and that's what this bill
 
00:24:27.059 --> 00:24:28.250 align:start position:0%
make it better and that's what this bill
does

00:24:28.250 --> 00:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
does
 
00:24:28.260 --> 00:24:29.870 align:start position:0%
does
and

00:24:29.870 --> 00:24:29.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:31.440 align:start position:0%
I'm just going down the hall so I'll
 
00:24:33.049 --> 00:24:33.059 align:start position:0%
take one or two questions if there are
 
00:24:33.059 --> 00:24:35.090 align:start position:0%
take one or two questions if there are
any

00:24:35.090 --> 00:24:35.100 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:24:37.130 --> 00:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
I just let the representative know and
 
00:24:40.190 --> 00:24:40.200 align:start position:0%
everyone else that on the last Tuesday
 
00:24:42.289 --> 00:24:42.299 align:start position:0%
of the month in the afternoon somewhere
 
00:24:44.570 --> 00:24:44.580 align:start position:0%
in the building we will be having a
 
00:24:46.970 --> 00:24:46.980 align:start position:0%
continuing education program led by the
 
00:24:49.430 --> 00:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
Chief Justice of the Supreme Court the
 
00:24:51.110 --> 00:24:51.120 align:start position:0%
retired Chief Justice of the Supreme
 
00:24:54.789 --> 00:24:54.799 align:start position:0%
Court attorney had and
 
00:24:57.289 --> 00:24:57.299 align:start position:0%
Judge David King whose administrative
 
00:24:59.270 --> 00:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
Justice of the Circuit Court to answer
 
00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
these questions that a lot of people
 
00:25:03.230 --> 00:25:03.240 align:start position:0%
don't know the answers to and to receive
 
00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:05.100 align:start position:0%
questions from anybody that comes and
 
00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
you are invited yeah I appreciate that
 
00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
very much sir uh going back to the
 
00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:13.919 align:start position:0%
previous activities it's not this body
 
00:25:16.130 --> 00:25:16.140 align:start position:0%
that needs that information but it's the
 
00:25:18.890 --> 00:25:18.900 align:start position:0%
general population understood and we
 
00:25:20.210 --> 00:25:20.220 align:start position:0%
hope that this would be but the
 
00:25:22.370 --> 00:25:22.380 align:start position:0%
beginning of an education process not
 
00:25:24.230 --> 00:25:24.240 align:start position:0%
just for the house but for the general
 
00:25:26.930 --> 00:25:26.940 align:start position:0%
population I think it would help members
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
of the House some of whom oftentimes
 
00:25:32.210 --> 00:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
seeing no questions for the
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative have fun in your exact
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
session and now the chair recognizes The
 
00:25:40.070 --> 00:25:40.080 align:start position:0%
Honorable Betty gay and alumna of this
 
00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:41.390 align:start position:0%
Honorable Betty gay and alumna of this
body

00:25:41.390 --> 00:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
body
 
00:25:51.049 --> 00:25:51.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.330 --> 00:25:53.340 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for taking my my
 
00:25:56.330 --> 00:25:56.340 align:start position:0%
testimony it's extremely simple
 
00:25:58.850 --> 00:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
I think ever since the Magna Carta and
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
they recognize that we need rights
 
00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:04.260 align:start position:0%
one of the rights that we all assume is
 
00:26:06.649 --> 00:26:06.659 align:start position:0%
that when you're in court you have a
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
right to present evidence to support
 
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:11.640 align:start position:0%
your case especially something that
 
00:26:15.049 --> 00:26:15.059 align:start position:0%
would protect you and so I brought a
 
00:26:17.330 --> 00:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
current copy I'll hand it out the
 
00:26:21.409 --> 00:26:21.419 align:start position:0%
current copy of rule 2.2 rules of the
 
00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:22.860 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court of the State of New
 
00:26:24.669 --> 00:26:24.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Family Division
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
rule 2.2 application of New Hampshire
 
00:26:30.169 --> 00:26:30.179 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence the New Hampshire
 
00:26:33.409 --> 00:26:33.419 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence do not apply to the
 
00:26:35.029 --> 00:26:35.039 align:start position:0%
actions listed above
 
00:26:37.490 --> 00:26:37.500 align:start position:0%
however the coordinates in its
 
00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:40.559 align:start position:0%
discretion May utilize the New Hampshire
 
00:26:42.950 --> 00:26:42.960 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence to enhance the
 
00:26:45.049 --> 00:26:45.059 align:start position:0%
predictable orderly fair and reliable
 
00:26:48.169 --> 00:26:48.179 align:start position:0%
presentation of evidence
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
I guess I was shocked as are the people
 
00:26:54.610 --> 00:26:54.620 align:start position:0%
that I tell that this law is needed this
 
00:26:57.830 --> 00:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
because we all assume that you always
 
00:27:00.169 --> 00:27:00.179 align:start position:0%
have the Rules of Evidence to support
 
00:27:04.430 --> 00:27:04.440 align:start position:0%
you and that of course if the judge
 
00:27:07.970 --> 00:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
determines that it's not applicable
 
00:27:09.769 --> 00:27:09.779 align:start position:0%
so I really appreciate all the
 
00:27:12.470 --> 00:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
wordsmithing that y'all have done to
 
00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:15.480 align:start position:0%
show that it's the right to present
 
00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:19.020 align:start position:0%
evidence you're not overturning uh the
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
judge's right to not accept it so I
 
00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
really do appreciate your fine-tuning
 
00:27:29.390 --> 00:27:29.400 align:start position:0%
the wording but I do hope that you
 
00:27:34.250 --> 00:27:34.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:37.140 align:start position:0%
that you would really want the right to
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
present evidence to support your case
 
00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:45.120 align:start position:0%
the reason for this I I became aware
 
00:27:48.289 --> 00:27:48.299 align:start position:0%
of the lack of this protection when I
 
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:51.840 align:start position:0%
met a couple of people who
 
00:27:55.970 --> 00:27:55.980 align:start position:0%
um or refused an evidentiary hearing
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
they had the evidence to support it and
 
00:28:00.710 --> 00:28:00.720 align:start position:0%
it was of course critical to their case
 
00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
it was custody of their child
 
00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:06.360 align:start position:0%
um and the judge
 
00:28:08.269 --> 00:28:08.279 align:start position:0%
simply said I've already made up my mind
 
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:09.960 align:start position:0%
I don't need evidence
 
00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:12.120 align:start position:0%
so this just levels the playing field
 
00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:14.640 align:start position:0%
makes everybody have the right that they
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
would have in Criminal Court
 
00:28:19.909 --> 00:28:19.919 align:start position:0%
to uh have it in Family Court would you
 
00:28:21.590 --> 00:28:21.600 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.510 align:start position:0%
take any questions
sure

00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
sure
 
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.380 align:start position:0%
but I don't see any so thank you for
 
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
your testimony thank you chair
 
00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.330 --> 00:28:35.340 align:start position:0%
that would be of the pink card Gale
 
00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:42.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:45.409 --> 00:28:45.419 align:start position:0%

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:56.760 align:start position:0%
have the greatest ability to reform and
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
create laws to better protect the
 
00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059 align:start position:0%

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:05.640 align:start position:0%
I respectfully pray each of you support
 
00:29:08.090 --> 00:29:08.100 align:start position:0%

00:29:42.529 --> 00:29:42.539 align:start position:0%
and the refusal to acknowledge or admit
 
00:29:45.409 --> 00:29:45.419 align:start position:0%
evidence has detrimental consequences
 
00:29:46.850 --> 00:29:46.860 align:start position:0%

00:31:07.909 --> 00:31:07.919 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chairman members of the
 
00:31:09.289 --> 00:31:09.299 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
00:31:11.149 --> 00:31:11.159 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
00:31:13.610 --> 00:31:13.620 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch we do not support
 
00:31:15.730 --> 00:31:15.740 align:start position:0%
this bill as written and I wanted to
 
00:31:18.830 --> 00:31:18.840 align:start position:0%
briefly explain why that is
 
00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
first off I just want to remind
 
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
everybody what we're talking about when
 
00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:23.820 align:start position:0%
we're talking Family Division it
 
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:25.980 align:start position:0%
references Family Court we don't have a
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
family court per se we have Family
 
00:31:30.350 --> 00:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
Division within the Circuit Court
 
00:31:32.330 --> 00:31:32.340 align:start position:0%
Family Division within the Circuit Court
 
00:31:35.029 --> 00:31:35.039 align:start position:0%
does not just handle marital cases it
 
00:31:37.430 --> 00:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
handles domestic violence guardianship
 
00:31:40.990 --> 00:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
of minors juvenile delinquency
 
00:31:44.029 --> 00:31:44.039 align:start position:0%
termination of parental rights abuse and
 
00:31:45.490 --> 00:31:45.500 align:start position:0%
neglect cases
 
00:31:49.130 --> 00:31:49.140 align:start position:0%
children in need of services adoption in
 
00:31:51.470 --> 00:31:51.480 align:start position:0%
addition to marital cases so we're not
 
00:31:53.389 --> 00:31:53.399 align:start position:0%
simply talking about
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
marital cases we're not simply talking
 
00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.590 align:start position:0%
marital cases we're not simply talking
about

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:56.600 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:31:58.850 --> 00:31:58.860 align:start position:0%
divorces we're talking about a wide
 
00:32:00.769 --> 00:32:00.779 align:start position:0%
range of cases when we're talking about
 
00:32:04.250 --> 00:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
so what this bill would do in the first
 
00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:09.600 align:start position:0%
sentence is provide that
 
00:32:11.690 --> 00:32:11.700 align:start position:0%
parties have the right to present
 
00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:13.860 align:start position:0%
evidence and testimony and the second
 
00:32:17.870 --> 00:32:17.880 align:start position:0%
sentence is a absolute prohibition on
 
00:32:21.409 --> 00:32:21.419 align:start position:0%
any limitation so that presiding judge
 
00:32:24.130 --> 00:32:24.140 align:start position:0%
is not allowed to limit the authority
 
00:32:26.570 --> 00:32:26.580 align:start position:0%
The Rules of Evidence would not be
 
00:32:29.690 --> 00:32:29.700 align:start position:0%
allowed to limit that power and the
 
00:32:31.970 --> 00:32:31.980 align:start position:0%
rules would not be allowed to limit that
 
00:32:31.980 --> 00:32:33.169 align:start position:0%
rules would not be allowed to limit that
power

00:32:33.169 --> 00:32:33.179 align:start position:0%
power
 
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
and and similar to what you know we've
 
00:32:37.370 --> 00:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
seen it in hearings before this
 
00:32:39.950 --> 00:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
committee at times the presiding or the
 
00:32:41.690 --> 00:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
the chairman
 
00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:42.590 align:start position:0%
the chairman
um

00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
informs a a witness that they are not
 
00:32:47.389 --> 00:32:47.399 align:start position:0%
speaking about the topic of the bill
 
00:32:50.029 --> 00:32:50.039 align:start position:0%
that they've gone off topic and and ask
 
00:32:52.669 --> 00:32:52.679 align:start position:0%
that person to stay with the topic of
 
00:32:53.649 --> 00:32:53.659 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
00:32:56.810 --> 00:32:56.820 align:start position:0%
sometimes the chairman will limit the
 
00:32:59.210 --> 00:32:59.220 align:start position:0%
amount of time a person has to testify
 
00:33:01.730 --> 00:33:01.740 align:start position:0%
because you have 20 other bills behind
 
00:33:03.889 --> 00:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
that bill or there are a lot of people
 
00:33:06.710 --> 00:33:06.720 align:start position:0%
that are coming to testify it's not that
 
00:33:10.430 --> 00:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
much different in a courtroom we there
 
00:33:12.649 --> 00:33:12.659 align:start position:0%
is going to be a particular issue that
 
00:33:15.169 --> 00:33:15.179 align:start position:0%
is before the judge on that day and the
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
judge nears needs to hear evidence and
 
00:33:19.669 --> 00:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
testimony that is relevant to that
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
particular issue and if it goes off of
 
00:33:24.230 --> 00:33:24.240 align:start position:0%
that issue or the information that's
 
00:33:27.529 --> 00:33:27.539 align:start position:0%
trying to be presented is is on a
 
00:33:28.909 --> 00:33:28.919 align:start position:0%
different issue maybe except for a
 
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:32.760 align:start position:0%
different hearing or just not what is
 
00:33:34.610 --> 00:33:34.620 align:start position:0%
before the judge and what the judge has
 
00:33:36.590 --> 00:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
to decide on that particular day for
 
00:33:38.990 --> 00:33:39.000 align:start position:0%
that hearing the judge may try to limit
 
00:33:41.950 --> 00:33:41.960 align:start position:0%
that that testimony and information
 
00:33:46.430 --> 00:33:46.440 align:start position:0%
in this bill would essentially
 
00:33:49.370 --> 00:33:49.380 align:start position:0%
turn over control of the courtroom
 
00:33:51.889 --> 00:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
and how courtroom proceedings are
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
handled and managed to the parties
 
00:33:56.750 --> 00:33:56.760 align:start position:0%
instead of the judge and I bring up the
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
word filibuster because there's nothing
 
00:34:02.389 --> 00:34:02.399 align:start position:0%
in this bill that would limit a party in
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
terms of time in terms of scope in terms
 
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
of Topic in terms of any information
 
00:34:10.190 --> 00:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
that is being presented or the number of
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
witnesses that are being presented or
 
00:34:14.930 --> 00:34:14.940 align:start position:0%
what they're going to talk about you
 
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:17.460 align:start position:0%
know somebody may decide I have to read
 
00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:20.700 align:start position:0%
every word of my three volume file from
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
beginning to end because I as a party
 
00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
think that is important for the judge
 
00:34:26.389 --> 00:34:26.399 align:start position:0%
because I don't think the Judge has read
 
00:34:29.470 --> 00:34:29.480 align:start position:0%
the file it might take a day and a half
 
00:34:32.389 --> 00:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
this would eliminate the judge's ability
 
00:34:34.010 --> 00:34:34.020 align:start position:0%
to control
 
00:34:38.089 --> 00:34:38.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:40.919 align:start position:0%
and and the reality is the judges simply
 
00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:43.080 align:start position:0%
has to be able to
 
00:34:45.530 --> 00:34:45.540 align:start position:0%
control evidence to be what's relevant
 
00:34:48.770 --> 00:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
to the subject that is before that judge
 
00:34:51.230 --> 00:34:51.240 align:start position:0%
um The Rules of Evidence applied
 
00:34:54.050 --> 00:34:54.060 align:start position:0%
generally but do not apply strictly
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
um and the reason for that is is in the
 
00:34:59.089 --> 00:34:59.099 align:start position:0%
vast majority especially over talking
 
00:35:01.609 --> 00:35:01.619 align:start position:0%
about marital vast majority of parties
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
are not represented by Council and most
 
00:35:07.550 --> 00:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
parties have do not know the rules of
 
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
evidence they have gone to law school
 
00:35:11.750 --> 00:35:11.760 align:start position:0%
they haven't studied them or if they
 
00:35:13.790 --> 00:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
read them they may not understand it you
 
00:35:17.630 --> 00:35:17.640 align:start position:0%
know a basic rule of evidence is hearsay
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
everyone knows what hearsay is hearsay
 
00:35:21.650 --> 00:35:21.660 align:start position:0%
and I would have to read it again
 
00:35:22.609 --> 00:35:22.619 align:start position:0%
because it's been a little while but
 
00:35:24.530 --> 00:35:24.540 align:start position:0%
hearsay is an out of court statement
 
00:35:27.230 --> 00:35:27.240 align:start position:0%
being made or being introduced for the
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
truth of the matter asserted so you know
 
00:35:32.510 --> 00:35:32.520 align:start position:0%
does everybody know what the truth of
 
00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:35.300 align:start position:0%
the matter asserted means in terms of of
 
00:35:39.589 --> 00:35:39.599 align:start position:0%
hearsay does a party who's never sort of
 
00:35:41.150 --> 00:35:41.160 align:start position:0%
been in court before know what that
 
00:35:44.569 --> 00:35:44.579 align:start position:0%
means does a party who has
 
00:35:47.089 --> 00:35:47.099 align:start position:0%
um limited educational background know
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
what that means does a person with
 
00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:50.700 align:start position:0%
mental health issues know what that
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
means probably not so if we were to
 
00:35:55.370 --> 00:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
apply the Rules of Evidence strictly
 
00:35:57.650 --> 00:35:57.660 align:start position:0%
we're actually probably treating parties
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
unfairly especially if one understands
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
it and the other doesn't so you you sort
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
of have to be able to use those as
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
guidelines we want relevant information
 
00:36:11.089 --> 00:36:11.099 align:start position:0%
we want timely information but we also
 
00:36:14.150 --> 00:36:14.160 align:start position:0%
have 10 other cases behind that that
 
00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
case and and if somebody were to
 
00:36:21.530 --> 00:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
essentially consume the day time because
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
they think information is is important
 
00:36:25.370 --> 00:36:25.380 align:start position:0%
and relevant
 
00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
other parties are not going to have
 
00:36:29.270 --> 00:36:29.280 align:start position:0%
their case heard because there's only so
 
00:36:31.250 --> 00:36:31.260 align:start position:0%
many hours in a day so you have seven
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
and a half hours if they go beyond their
 
00:36:36.710 --> 00:36:36.720 align:start position:0%
a lot of time and they essentially spend
 
00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:38.820 align:start position:0%
the day there's nothing the judge can do
 
00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:41.640 align:start position:0%
to control that that
 
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
uh introduce an introduction of evidence
 
00:36:48.349 --> 00:36:48.359 align:start position:0%
or testimony it can also be done used in
 
00:36:51.589 --> 00:36:51.599 align:start position:0%
a way to abuse the other party so if
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
there is a disparity of wealth if
 
00:36:55.990 --> 00:36:56.000 align:start position:0%
there's a disparity of time availability
 
00:36:59.030 --> 00:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
somebody who knows that and simply wants
 
00:37:01.609 --> 00:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
to punish the other side can say I'm
 
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
going to spend the next day and I'm
 
00:37:06.170 --> 00:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
going to make this person come back and
 
00:37:09.530 --> 00:37:09.540 align:start position:0%
miss work tomorrow because I can and
 
00:37:11.650 --> 00:37:11.660 align:start position:0%
because the judge can't stop me
 
00:37:14.630 --> 00:37:14.640 align:start position:0%
it is you know that ability to control
 
00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:17.220 align:start position:0%
the courthouse is an essential function
 
00:37:19.250 --> 00:37:19.260 align:start position:0%
of that judge who's presiding in that
 
00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.630 align:start position:0%
of that judge who's presiding in that
hearing

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:20.640 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.849 align:start position:0%
hearing
um

00:37:22.849 --> 00:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:25.069 --> 00:37:25.079 align:start position:0%
parties do have the right to introduce
 
00:37:29.329 --> 00:37:29.339 align:start position:0%
evidence and testimony and that that's
 
00:37:32.089 --> 00:37:32.099 align:start position:0%
just that is a a right that exists in
 
00:37:34.609 --> 00:37:34.619 align:start position:0%
court I can't speak to why in a
 
00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:37.200 align:start position:0%
particular case a judge may have limited
 
00:37:39.589 --> 00:37:39.599 align:start position:0%
or or prohibited some element of
 
00:37:42.410 --> 00:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
testimony I just you know that is a very
 
00:37:44.810 --> 00:37:44.820 align:start position:0%
case-specific time-specific issue and I
 
00:37:46.849 --> 00:37:46.859 align:start position:0%
I simply can't address it but the fact
 
00:37:49.310 --> 00:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
is parties at a hearing have the right
 
00:37:53.089 --> 00:37:53.099 align:start position:0%
to introduce evidence and testimony but
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
it is controlled generally as as
 
00:38:00.410 --> 00:38:00.420 align:start position:0%
as Miss gay spoke to you know we do have
 
00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:03.540 align:start position:0%
a rule that says essentially while
 
00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:04.859 align:start position:0%
they're not while the Rules of Evidence
 
00:38:08.210 --> 00:38:08.220 align:start position:0%
don't apply strictly they do apply for
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
purposes of ensuring the reliable and
 
00:38:13.970 --> 00:38:13.980 align:start position:0%
and predictable nature of a proceeding
 
00:38:16.970 --> 00:38:16.980 align:start position:0%
um so this bill would essentially remove
 
00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:19.140 align:start position:0%
the ability of a judge to control that
 
00:38:20.810 --> 00:38:20.820 align:start position:0%
courtroom control the flow of
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
information and also ensure that all
 
00:38:26.329 --> 00:38:26.339 align:start position:0%
cases that are that are need to be heard
 
00:38:27.730 --> 00:38:27.740 align:start position:0%
get heard
 
00:38:30.890 --> 00:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
and we have a significant level of
 
00:38:33.770 --> 00:38:33.780 align:start position:0%
concern about the impact that this bill
 
00:38:37.730 --> 00:38:37.740 align:start position:0%
would have on court proceedings and the
 
00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:39.780 align:start position:0%
rights of parties to be actually heard
 
00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
before the judge with that I'll conclude
 
00:38:44.810 --> 00:38:44.820 align:start position:0%
my comments but would be happy to answer
 
00:38:45.950 --> 00:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
your questions thank you questions
 
00:38:47.750 --> 00:38:47.760 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
00:38:50.690 --> 00:38:50.700 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Vice chairman um I'm just
 
00:38:53.329 --> 00:38:53.339 align:start position:0%
wondering if in the event that the
 
00:38:55.670 --> 00:38:55.680 align:start position:0%
language changes were implemented that
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
we were discussing earlier before in
 
00:38:58.670 --> 00:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
this hearing
 
00:39:01.190 --> 00:39:01.200 align:start position:0%
would that have a positive or negative
 
00:39:04.609 --> 00:39:04.619 align:start position:0%
or neutral effect on so it would depend
 
00:39:05.810 --> 00:39:05.820 align:start position:0%
on the words
 
00:39:07.490 --> 00:39:07.500 align:start position:0%
um and I apologize you know I can only
 
00:39:10.849 --> 00:39:10.859 align:start position:0%
speak to this bill it
 
00:39:10.859 --> 00:39:11.930 align:start position:0%
speak to this bill it
yeah

00:39:11.930 --> 00:39:11.940 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
it probably won't be worse
 
00:39:17.089 --> 00:39:17.099 align:start position:0%
um uh but I don't I don't sort of know
 
00:39:21.050 --> 00:39:21.060 align:start position:0%
if the goal is to allow parties to
 
00:39:23.290 --> 00:39:23.300 align:start position:0%
introduce evidence without restriction
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
it's always going to create the same
 
00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.650 align:start position:0%
it's always going to create the same
problem

00:39:27.650 --> 00:39:27.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.150 --> 00:39:29.160 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
representative both
 
00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:33.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Vice chair
 
00:39:34.849 --> 00:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:39:36.530 --> 00:39:36.540 align:start position:0%
um I'm just wondering you had mentioned
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
that the disparate disparity of time and
 
00:39:42.589 --> 00:39:42.599 align:start position:0%
wealth makes it unfair doesn't that
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
happen every anyway given that some some
 
00:39:47.750 --> 00:39:47.760 align:start position:0%
parties can afford an attorney and some
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
can't so wouldn't
 
00:39:53.270 --> 00:39:53.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm not really understanding how that
 
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
applies here since it's already unfair
 
00:39:58.010 --> 00:39:58.020 align:start position:0%
so um thank you for the question I I
 
00:40:00.230 --> 00:40:00.240 align:start position:0%
would you know there is always a not
 
00:40:01.730 --> 00:40:01.740 align:start position:0%
always but there can be disparity
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
between parties and and uh and what
 
00:40:07.870 --> 00:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
they're they have an ability to bring
 
00:40:10.609 --> 00:40:10.619 align:start position:0%
some of that is ultimately managed by
 
00:40:13.790 --> 00:40:13.800 align:start position:0%
the judge to ensure that parties who
 
00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:15.650 align:start position:0%
the judge to ensure that parties who
um

00:40:15.650 --> 00:40:15.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:18.170 --> 00:40:18.180 align:start position:0%
to ensure that parties can be heard and
 
00:40:19.609 --> 00:40:19.619 align:start position:0%
and do get heard
 
00:40:22.010 --> 00:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
um so it is sort of when you get into
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
the courtroom
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
um the opportunity is there for for both
 
00:40:28.690 --> 00:40:28.700 align:start position:0%
parties and it is the judge's sort of
 
00:40:32.030 --> 00:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
ability to control that testimony and
 
00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:34.740 align:start position:0%
the information that provides the The
 
00:40:36.950 --> 00:40:36.960 align:start position:0%
More Level Playing Field so I won't
 
00:40:39.530 --> 00:40:39.540 align:start position:0%
disagree that that certainly there is a
 
00:40:42.050 --> 00:40:42.060 align:start position:0%
potential disparity between wealth time
 
00:40:44.089 --> 00:40:44.099 align:start position:0%
availability but once you're in that
 
00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:45.770 align:start position:0%
availability but once you're in that
courtroom

00:40:45.770 --> 00:40:45.780 align:start position:0%
courtroom
 
00:40:47.270 --> 00:40:47.280 align:start position:0%
um both parties should have the
 
00:40:49.010 --> 00:40:49.020 align:start position:0%
opportunity and do have the opportunity
 
00:40:51.290 --> 00:40:51.300 align:start position:0%
to present evidence and again I can't
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
speak to a specific case where evidence
 
00:40:55.609 --> 00:40:55.619 align:start position:0%
was limited as to why
 
00:40:58.130 --> 00:40:58.140 align:start position:0%
um but that is how you know in terms of
 
00:41:01.250 --> 00:41:01.260 align:start position:0%
the judge what the judge can do is to
 
00:41:03.050 --> 00:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
ensure that the parties do have the
 
00:41:04.849 --> 00:41:04.859 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present and talk to the
 
00:41:04.859 --> 00:41:05.810 align:start position:0%
opportunity to present and talk to the
judge

00:41:05.810 --> 00:41:05.820 align:start position:0%
judge
 
00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:08.870 align:start position:0%
judge
mm-hmm

00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:11.329 --> 00:41:11.339 align:start position:0%
representative long I
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
think of Mr chairman uh
 
00:41:16.849 --> 00:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
so I understand the hearing of the uh
 
00:41:20.750 --> 00:41:20.760 align:start position:0%
specific issue so I'm going for this
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
hearing is on a financial matters
 
00:41:26.390 --> 00:41:26.400 align:start position:0%
um I have evidence that will I believe
 
00:41:28.430 --> 00:41:28.440 align:start position:0%
will get me
 
00:41:30.770 --> 00:41:30.780 align:start position:0%
um more time with my child so I want to
 
00:41:32.690 --> 00:41:32.700 align:start position:0%
submit that evidence
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
if this bill is passed even with the
 
00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:35.900 align:start position:0%
language change
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
I can submit that evidence however the
 
00:41:41.870 --> 00:41:41.880 align:start position:0%
court the judge could say I'm not going
 
00:41:45.650 --> 00:41:45.660 align:start position:0%
to admit it because we're not here on uh
 
00:41:47.750 --> 00:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
time spent with the child it it's it's
 
00:41:50.089 --> 00:41:50.099 align:start position:0%
not the issue could it could a judge do
 
00:41:50.099 --> 00:41:50.930 align:start position:0%
not the issue could it could a judge do
that

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:50.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:41:53.089 --> 00:41:53.099 align:start position:0%
that's what the judge says now you know
 
00:41:55.430 --> 00:41:55.440 align:start position:0%
if somebody were to bring forward so as
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
you thank you for the question so
 
00:41:59.089 --> 00:41:59.099 align:start position:0%
somebody were to bring forward you know
 
00:42:02.390 --> 00:42:02.400 align:start position:0%
during a a hearing on distribution of of
 
00:42:04.370 --> 00:42:04.380 align:start position:0%
money or or the you know particular
 
00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:06.060 align:start position:0%
asset the sale of a house and they tried
 
00:42:09.470 --> 00:42:09.480 align:start position:0%
to bring up you know parenting time
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
um they would not be allowed to do it in
 
00:42:13.490 --> 00:42:13.500 align:start position:0%
that in that proceeding and they would
 
00:42:15.410 --> 00:42:15.420 align:start position:0%
be asked to stop doing that in the
 
00:42:17.210 --> 00:42:17.220 align:start position:0%
proceeding similar to what you do in in
 
00:42:19.250 --> 00:42:19.260 align:start position:0%
the Committee hearing and say
 
00:42:20.870 --> 00:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
essentially that's a different issue
 
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:22.560 align:start position:0%
we'll deal with that later or we've
 
00:42:24.230 --> 00:42:24.240 align:start position:0%
already dealt with that if you want to
 
00:42:26.990 --> 00:42:27.000 align:start position:0%
amend your parenting schedule file a
 
00:42:28.430 --> 00:42:28.440 align:start position:0%
motion on it
 
00:42:30.170 --> 00:42:30.180 align:start position:0%
um you know there's a process for for
 
00:42:32.750 --> 00:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
having that come before the judge if you
 
00:42:34.010 --> 00:42:34.020 align:start position:0%
were to say
 
00:42:36.589 --> 00:42:36.599 align:start position:0%
it may be completely irrelevant
 
00:42:39.109 --> 00:42:39.119 align:start position:0%
introduce it anyway and then the judge
 
00:42:41.450 --> 00:42:41.460 align:start position:0%
can decide later on whether or not it is
 
00:42:43.849 --> 00:42:43.859 align:start position:0%
going to ultimately be admissible as
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
evidence one you've consumed that
 
00:42:50.510 --> 00:42:50.520 align:start position:0%
incredibly valuable time in a courtroom
 
00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:52.980 align:start position:0%
um for whatever length it may take it
 
00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:56.040 align:start position:0%
may be I want to try my entire case when
 
00:42:59.329 --> 00:42:59.339 align:start position:0%
the hearing is about the sale of a house
 
00:43:02.210 --> 00:43:02.220 align:start position:0%
um and then secondly if I'm the other
 
00:43:02.220 --> 00:43:03.710 align:start position:0%
um and then secondly if I'm the other
party

00:43:03.710 --> 00:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
party
 
00:43:06.109 --> 00:43:06.119 align:start position:0%
I don't know you know I may not know I
 
00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:07.560 align:start position:0%
gotta respond to everything that just
 
00:43:09.770 --> 00:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
just was heard so I may have prolonged
 
00:43:11.750 --> 00:43:11.760 align:start position:0%
what I'm testifying to
 
00:43:13.730 --> 00:43:13.740 align:start position:0%
um or presenting because now the judges
 
00:43:15.050 --> 00:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
heard all these other things that are
 
00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:18.000 align:start position:0%
completely irrelevant and and it would
 
00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:19.030 align:start position:0%
completely irrelevant and and it would
be

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:19.040 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:43:21.950 --> 00:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
hard-pressed for a party if the other
 
00:43:24.970 --> 00:43:24.980 align:start position:0%
side just spent an hour talking about
 
00:43:27.589 --> 00:43:27.599 align:start position:0%
parenting time when the issue is the
 
00:43:30.230 --> 00:43:30.240 align:start position:0%
sale of a house not to spend a great
 
00:43:31.609 --> 00:43:31.619 align:start position:0%
deal of time talking about parenting
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
time and all you do is now start talking
 
00:43:35.690 --> 00:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
about parenting time when the reality is
 
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
we're just trying to get the sale of the
 
00:43:40.130 --> 00:43:40.140 align:start position:0%
house done a quick follow-up thank you
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
on line six the coach you'll note in the
 
00:43:44.150 --> 00:43:44.160 align:start position:0%
record of the preceding any evidence not
 
00:43:46.010 --> 00:43:46.020 align:start position:0%
admitted so the court has to look at the
 
00:43:46.020 --> 00:43:47.030 align:start position:0%
admitted so the court has to look at the
evidence

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.290 align:start position:0%
evidence
I

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:48.300 align:start position:0%
I
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
that does that mean not write it write a
 
00:43:55.069 --> 00:43:55.079 align:start position:0%
note uh there was evidence
 
00:43:58.130 --> 00:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
presented on X I didn't admit it or does
 
00:44:01.069 --> 00:44:01.079 align:start position:0%
that look like I need to have I need to
 
00:44:04.490 --> 00:44:04.500 align:start position:0%
note the actual evidence
 
00:44:07.130 --> 00:44:07.140 align:start position:0%
um on so I I did not take the evidence
 
00:44:10.069 --> 00:44:10.079 align:start position:0%
on parenting time however
 
00:44:13.010 --> 00:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
the evidence was
 
00:44:16.910 --> 00:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
it I'm kind of confused on on a note to
 
00:44:20.690 --> 00:44:20.700 align:start position:0%
me as a note uh however the evidence not
 
00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:23.220 align:start position:0%
admitted do I is it the actual evidence
 
00:44:26.450 --> 00:44:26.460 align:start position:0%
that I have to at least that's not so
 
00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:27.540 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question I don't know
 
00:44:29.750 --> 00:44:29.760 align:start position:0%
what what specifically the bill would
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
intend by the word no to my mind could
 
00:44:34.069 --> 00:44:34.079 align:start position:0%
be verbal
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
um it could be written afterward
 
00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:37.569 align:start position:0%
um it could be written afterward
um

00:44:37.569 --> 00:44:37.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:40.250 --> 00:44:40.260 align:start position:0%
not specific in the bill as to what that
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
meant so it would be sort of subject to
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
interpretation subsequently
 
00:44:45.470 --> 00:44:45.480 align:start position:0%
um but again
 
00:44:47.750 --> 00:44:47.760 align:start position:0%
whether or not the judges is admitting
 
00:44:49.609 --> 00:44:49.619 align:start position:0%
it I think as the other side I would be
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
hard-pressed not to spend an awful lot
 
00:44:53.450 --> 00:44:53.460 align:start position:0%
of time talking about the a bunch of
 
00:44:55.790 --> 00:44:55.800 align:start position:0%
irrelevant stuff that just got
 
00:44:57.770 --> 00:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
talked about by the other side sure I
 
00:45:01.010 --> 00:45:01.020 align:start position:0%
think just one human nature and two
 
00:45:03.410 --> 00:45:03.420 align:start position:0%
um sort of the judges now heard it it's
 
00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:07.140 align:start position:0%
now sort of in the judge's head I now
 
00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
want to make sure the judge understands
 
00:45:11.809 --> 00:45:11.819 align:start position:0%
the other perspective so it would just
 
00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:14.640 align:start position:0%
significantly disrupt hearings okay
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
thank you representative ball
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman
 
00:45:20.930 --> 00:45:20.940 align:start position:0%
um just another follow-up I'm sorry
 
00:45:22.910 --> 00:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question so if
 
00:45:25.430 --> 00:45:25.440 align:start position:0%
they included the word where it says on
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
line four shall have the right to
 
00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:28.980 align:start position:0%
present evidence if they included the
 
00:45:31.130 --> 00:45:31.140 align:start position:0%
word relevant evidence would that at
 
00:45:33.410 --> 00:45:33.420 align:start position:0%
least cut it down and allow the judge to
 
00:45:37.069 --> 00:45:37.079 align:start position:0%
to make determinations of uni it's this
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
is not relevant to the case so like you
 
00:45:41.690 --> 00:45:41.700 align:start position:0%
were saying if you're talking about the
 
00:45:43.130 --> 00:45:43.140 align:start position:0%
sale of the house that doesn't have to
 
00:45:45.410 --> 00:45:45.420 align:start position:0%
do with child time so in that case it
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
would be like that's not going to that's
 
00:45:48.829 --> 00:45:48.839 align:start position:0%
not going to be admissible or I'm not
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
going to take that because it's it's not
 
00:45:53.990 --> 00:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
relevant to what we're discussing
 
00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:54.650 align:start position:0%
relevant to what we're discussing
um

00:45:54.650 --> 00:45:54.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:57.050 --> 00:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
so relevance may not so thank you for
 
00:45:58.130 --> 00:45:58.140 align:start position:0%
the question
 
00:45:59.930 --> 00:45:59.940 align:start position:0%
generally that's an improvement it's
 
00:46:01.970 --> 00:46:01.980 align:start position:0%
what happens already so I'm not sure why
 
00:46:03.770 --> 00:46:03.780 align:start position:0%
it needs to be in statute it doesn't
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
change anything but relevance may not be
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
the only issue
 
00:46:12.349 --> 00:46:12.359 align:start position:0%
um in terms of of its presentation
 
00:46:12.359 --> 00:46:12.950 align:start position:0%
um in terms of of its presentation
um

00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:16.010 --> 00:46:16.020 align:start position:0%
so it it would
 
00:46:18.710 --> 00:46:18.720 align:start position:0%
it would it would narrow this bill it
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you attorney head appreciate your
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you we're coming up on a

deadline so I'd ask any remaining
 
00:46:34.790 --> 00:46:34.800 align:start position:0%
testimony to be uh succinct and to the
 
00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:37.140 align:start position:0%
point chair calls representative J.D

Bernardi who wishes to testify on this
 
00:46:40.079 --> 00:46:44.870 align:start position:0%
Bernardi who wishes to testify on this
bill

00:46:44.870 --> 00:46:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:49.990 --> 00:46:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.069 --> 00:46:52.079 align:start position:0%
representative JD Bernardi from
 
00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:54.300 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 36.
 
00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579 align:start position:0%
um I did not plan to testify today but
 
00:47:00.170 --> 00:47:00.180 align:start position:0%
after hearing uh attorney head speak I
 
00:47:02.089 --> 00:47:02.099 align:start position:0%
just I had to
 
00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
um the fundamental premise of this law
 
00:47:08.270 --> 00:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
is is that the Rules of Evidence shall
 
00:47:11.569 --> 00:47:11.579 align:start position:0%
apply and the court shall not have the
 
00:47:14.329 --> 00:47:14.339 align:start position:0%
ability to say we're not going to allow
 
00:47:17.030 --> 00:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
them to apply that's the fundamental
 
00:47:19.730 --> 00:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
principle and if you look at the if you
 
00:47:22.430 --> 00:47:22.440 align:start position:0%
look at the uh the the amendment it
 
00:47:25.190 --> 00:47:25.200 align:start position:0%
basically says if evidence is presented
 
00:47:28.190 --> 00:47:28.200 align:start position:0%
that's not relevant not not appropriate
 
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
or or specific evidence to the uh is not
 
00:47:32.700 --> 00:47:33.849 align:start position:0%
or or specific evidence to the uh is not
um

00:47:33.849 --> 00:47:33.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:36.900 align:start position:0%
is is not is not relevant then the
 
00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.180 align:start position:0%
reason just needs to be identified it's
 
00:47:41.329 --> 00:47:41.339 align:start position:0%
that simple for the judge to say okay
 
00:47:43.370 --> 00:47:43.380 align:start position:0%
you presented a bunch of evidence that's
 
00:47:45.290 --> 00:47:45.300 align:start position:0%
not relevant to the to the point that
 
00:47:47.210 --> 00:47:47.220 align:start position:0%
we're discussing today there's nothing
 
00:47:50.450 --> 00:47:50.460 align:start position:0%
wrong with that but we're asking for
 
00:47:54.349 --> 00:47:54.359 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence to be the standard by
 
00:47:57.530 --> 00:47:57.540 align:start position:0%
which court proceedings are held and
 
00:47:59.210 --> 00:47:59.220 align:start position:0%
there's no reason why the Family
 
00:48:02.150 --> 00:48:02.160 align:start position:0%
Division should be the only division of
 
00:48:04.849 --> 00:48:04.859 align:start position:0%
our court system that says rules don't
 
00:48:04.859 --> 00:48:06.530 align:start position:0%
our court system that says rules don't
apply

00:48:06.530 --> 00:48:06.540 align:start position:0%
apply
 
00:48:08.510 --> 00:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for
 
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi representative
 
00:48:13.010 --> 00:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman um thank you
 
00:48:14.569 --> 00:48:14.579 align:start position:0%
for being here and testifying is there
 
00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:16.260 align:start position:0%
an amendment I don't have an amendment
 
00:48:19.270 --> 00:48:19.280 align:start position:0%
there is not an amendment yet okay
 
00:48:22.069 --> 00:48:22.079 align:start position:0%
making sure
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
if there's an amendment I don't have it
 
00:48:26.690 --> 00:48:26.700 align:start position:0%
it did not get to me I don't have any
 
00:48:30.589 --> 00:48:30.599 align:start position:0%
money I went to the prime sponsor is it
 
00:48:32.210 --> 00:48:32.220 align:start position:0%
looks like going to be crafting an
 
00:48:34.250 --> 00:48:34.260 align:start position:0%
amendment which if it gets here before
 
00:48:36.650 --> 00:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
noon we will consider when we exec the
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for the question though
 
00:48:40.670 --> 00:48:40.680 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
00:48:43.730 --> 00:48:43.740 align:start position:0%
no okay good thank you representative I
 
00:48:48.109 --> 00:48:48.119 align:start position:0%
have a pink card for Bill 479 that if
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
that is if Katrina Heinrich from Exeter
 
00:48:54.829 --> 00:48:54.839 align:start position:0%
wishes to speak to this bill here I'll
 
00:48:58.430 --> 00:48:58.440 align:start position:0%
make the change on the card welcome
 
00:49:00.349 --> 00:49:00.359 align:start position:0%
I realize with inflation it might have
 
00:49:02.809 --> 00:49:02.819 align:start position:0%
become Bill 479 but you never know so
 
00:49:08.150 --> 00:49:08.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:10.490 --> 00:49:10.500 align:start position:0%
I'm Katrina and I'm from Exeter New
 
00:49:12.650 --> 00:49:12.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you for taking this and
 
00:49:14.510 --> 00:49:14.520 align:start position:0%
changing my number
 
00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:15.839 align:start position:0%
um I wanted to speak to this just real
 
00:49:17.930 --> 00:49:17.940 align:start position:0%
quickly because
 
00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:21.540 align:start position:0%
as eloquently as as attorney head puts
 
00:49:23.690 --> 00:49:23.700 align:start position:0%
how the court is supposed to work and
 
00:49:25.609 --> 00:49:25.619 align:start position:0%
the options that the judges have and to
 
00:49:27.530 --> 00:49:27.540 align:start position:0%
maintain control of the Court it is
 
00:49:29.329 --> 00:49:29.339 align:start position:0%
important and I don't think anybody can
 
00:49:30.829 --> 00:49:30.839 align:start position:0%
dispute that
 
00:49:34.130 --> 00:49:34.140 align:start position:0%
however what can be disputed is attorney
 
00:49:36.050 --> 00:49:36.060 align:start position:0%
head continues to come back to we need
 
00:49:38.030 --> 00:49:38.040 align:start position:0%
to get 20 people in a day we need to do
 
00:49:40.309 --> 00:49:40.319 align:start position:0%
this which I've testified to in another
 
00:49:40.319 --> 00:49:41.450 align:start position:0%
this which I've testified to in another
bill

00:49:41.450 --> 00:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
this is exactly what I'm talking about
 
00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:45.660 align:start position:0%
we never resolve the issue he talks
 
00:49:48.170 --> 00:49:48.180 align:start position:0%
about one issue at a time
 
00:49:50.390 --> 00:49:50.400 align:start position:0%
a decade-long case
 
00:49:52.550 --> 00:49:52.560 align:start position:0%
does not have one issue at a time unless
 
00:49:54.349 --> 00:49:54.359 align:start position:0%
they're created
 
00:49:56.329 --> 00:49:56.339 align:start position:0%
and when there's no Witnesses allowed
 
00:49:58.670 --> 00:49:58.680 align:start position:0%
and I pack the I pack the courtroom
 
00:50:01.309 --> 00:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
three different times
 
00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500 align:start position:0%
not one witness was allowed to stay in
 
00:50:08.809 --> 00:50:08.819 align:start position:0%
the room let alone testify
 
00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:11.220 align:start position:0%
I brought evidence
 
00:50:14.329 --> 00:50:14.339 align:start position:0%
of job offers
 
00:50:16.069 --> 00:50:16.079 align:start position:0%
not admitted
 
00:50:19.970 --> 00:50:19.980 align:start position:0%
I brought evidence of the deterioration
 
00:50:22.910 --> 00:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
of my children from the schools not
 
00:50:22.920 --> 00:50:24.349 align:start position:0%
of my children from the schools not
admitted

00:50:24.349 --> 00:50:24.359 align:start position:0%
admitted
 
00:50:26.750 --> 00:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
the only thing that mattered was what
 
00:50:29.450 --> 00:50:29.460 align:start position:0%
the judge was doing to me and that was I
 
00:50:33.349 --> 00:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
was not allowed evidence ever
 
00:50:35.630 --> 00:50:35.640 align:start position:0%
and that's a problem
 
00:50:37.490 --> 00:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
that's a big problem because
 
00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
like you I assume you would want your
 
00:50:43.010 --> 00:50:43.020 align:start position:0%
evidence to be heard
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
my evidence was not heard I had children
 
00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:48.180 align:start position:0%
that were extremely harmed because of
 
00:50:50.569 --> 00:50:50.579 align:start position:0%
this 10 years come back into court keep
 
00:50:54.829 --> 00:50:54.839 align:start position:0%
coming back into court that's more
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
than an Evidence issue
 
00:50:59.990 --> 00:51:00.000 align:start position:0%
that's as attorney head said you get 20
 
00:51:02.390 --> 00:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
more in we gotta get 20 more in well if
 
00:51:04.309 --> 00:51:04.319 align:start position:0%
you'd have resolved it we wouldn't be
 
00:51:04.319 --> 00:51:05.450 align:start position:0%
you'd have resolved it we wouldn't be
here

00:51:05.450 --> 00:51:05.460 align:start position:0%
here
 
00:51:05.460 --> 00:51:06.589 align:start position:0%
here
so

00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:08.569 --> 00:51:08.579 align:start position:0%
when it comes to that that's all I have
 
00:51:10.970 --> 00:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
to say about it evidence is crucial it
 
00:51:13.490 --> 00:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
is not being heard in all cases perhaps
 
00:51:15.770 --> 00:51:15.780 align:start position:0%
there are some that they do
 
00:51:18.290 --> 00:51:18.300 align:start position:0%
but for the most part in my experience
 
00:51:21.230 --> 00:51:21.240 align:start position:0%
over a decade no
 
00:51:23.150 --> 00:51:23.160 align:start position:0%
and that's all I have
 
00:51:26.510 --> 00:51:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:28.790 --> 00:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony with that
 
00:51:31.970 --> 00:51:31.980 align:start position:0%
I'm closing the hearing on the house
 
00:51:37.430 --> 00:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
bill 475 we will execut later today we
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
have to exec all the bills before us
 
00:51:42.829 --> 00:51:42.839 align:start position:0%
today and we will exec this one with
 
00:51:46.309 --> 00:51:46.319 align:start position:0%
without any amendments that come to me
 
00:51:49.549 --> 00:51:49.559 align:start position:0%
with that I open the exact session on
 
00:51:53.089 --> 00:51:53.099 align:start position:0%
House Bill 10 and again I'm taking these
 
00:51:55.370 --> 00:51:55.380 align:start position:0%
out of the printed order depending on
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
people that we may need this is not a
 
00:52:02.990 --> 00:52:03.000 align:start position:0%
hearing no pink cards but we may ask
 
00:52:05.150 --> 00:52:05.160 align:start position:0%
different Prime sponsors for
 
00:52:07.790 --> 00:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
clarifications or if they're bringing in
 
00:52:10.549 --> 00:52:10.559 align:start position:0%
amendments specifically what that
 
00:52:12.950 --> 00:52:12.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment does so with that the chair
 
00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative Paul Terry one
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
of the authors
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
of the original House Bill 10 who has a
 
00:52:24.109 --> 00:52:24.119 align:start position:0%
new Amendment
 
00:52:26.990 --> 00:52:27.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm passing it around you saw the
 
00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:29.460 align:start position:0%
previous Amendment which was supposed to
 
00:52:32.150 --> 00:52:32.160 align:start position:0%
be the bill it didn't happen that way
 
00:52:36.410 --> 00:52:36.420 align:start position:0%
this is a an amendment now to what you
 
00:52:38.450 --> 00:52:38.460 align:start position:0%

this um bestowal of importance upon me
 
00:53:29.809 --> 00:53:29.819 align:start position:0%

subsequent to the the hearing
 
00:53:50.510 --> 00:53:50.520 align:start position:0%
last week I believe it was yes
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%

00:56:59.690 --> 00:56:59.700 align:start position:0%
whereby in lines 26 and following but
 
00:57:02.630 --> 00:57:02.640 align:start position:0%
specifically I'm sorry lines 11 and
 
00:57:06.770 --> 00:57:06.780 align:start position:0%
following in the previous version and in
 
00:57:08.930 --> 00:57:08.940 align:start position:0%
this version
 
00:57:08.940 --> 00:57:10.370 align:start position:0%
this version
uh

00:57:10.370 --> 00:57:10.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:57:13.250 --> 00:57:13.260 align:start position:0%
once again line 11 the First new
 
00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:14.510 align:start position:0%
once again line 11 the First new
sentence

00:57:14.510 --> 00:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
sentence
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
and the only new sentence appearing on
 
00:57:19.670 --> 00:57:19.680 align:start position:0%
line 11 any contractor or third party
 
00:57:22.010 --> 00:57:22.020 align:start position:0%
employed by the school that violates any
 
00:57:24.589 --> 00:57:24.599 align:start position:0%
section this bill shall be fined twenty
 
00:57:25.790 --> 00:57:25.800 align:start position:0%
five hundred dollars and be restricted
 
00:57:27.890 --> 00:57:27.900 align:start position:0%
from any further access to all schools
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
the replacement that we've made in the
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
amendment is in in this version is in
 
00:57:34.970 --> 00:57:34.980 align:start position:0%
the state replacing in the district and
 
00:57:36.890 --> 00:57:36.900 align:start position:0%
that's in response to the concern and
 
00:57:38.329 --> 00:57:38.339 align:start position:0%
the question raised by representative
 
00:57:41.030 --> 00:57:41.040 align:start position:0%
long with respect to the question of a
 
00:57:43.970 --> 00:57:43.980 align:start position:0%
possible unfair Labor practice
 
00:57:47.089 --> 00:57:47.099 align:start position:0%
so in line 13
 
00:57:49.849 --> 00:57:49.859 align:start position:0%
you see the words in the state and then
 
00:57:52.250 --> 00:57:52.260 align:start position:0%
you also see that repeated online in
 
00:57:55.130 --> 00:57:55.140 align:start position:0%
line embedded within line 14 plus
 
00:57:57.710 --> 00:57:57.720 align:start position:0%
permanent restriction from all schools
 
00:58:01.069 --> 00:58:01.079 align:start position:0%
in the state replacing the words in the
 
00:58:04.910 --> 00:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:07.260 align:start position:0%
the Third
 
00:58:11.210 --> 00:58:11.220 align:start position:0%
okay would you take questions now or do
 
00:58:12.650 --> 00:58:12.660 align:start position:0%
you wish to finish with respect to this
 
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
change to this change is it to this
 
00:58:18.829 --> 00:58:18.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:21.770 --> 00:58:21.780 align:start position:0%
so just to clarify so this is almost a
 
00:58:25.790 --> 00:58:25.800 align:start position:0%
more severe punishment so before it was
 
00:58:28.190 --> 00:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
just the school district
 
00:58:30.530 --> 00:58:30.540 align:start position:0%
and now it's the entire State you've
 
00:58:33.410 --> 00:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
expanded the
 
00:58:35.150 --> 00:58:35.160 align:start position:0%
yes the state would is a larger
 
00:58:38.089 --> 00:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction than the district
 
00:58:40.549 --> 00:58:40.559 align:start position:0%
um it's for a period of one year for the
 
00:58:43.609 --> 00:58:43.619 align:start position:0%
first offense and you changed it why
 
00:58:46.370 --> 00:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
because representative long had raised a
 
00:58:49.130 --> 00:58:49.140 align:start position:0%
question about a possible unfair Labor
 
00:58:53.930 --> 00:58:53.940 align:start position:0%
practice challenge with respect to not
 
00:58:57.890 --> 00:58:57.900 align:start position:0%
being able to uh apply for employment in
 
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.370 --> 00:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
we prohibited employment in the district
 
00:59:08.690 --> 00:59:08.700 align:start position:0%
where the offense occurred
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
but we did not address the question of
 
00:59:14.690 --> 00:59:14.700 align:start position:0%
applying for employment in any other
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
school district in the state of New
 
00:59:19.069 --> 00:59:19.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so the response to
 
00:59:21.770 --> 00:59:21.780 align:start position:0%
representative Long's concern we changed
 
00:59:24.109 --> 00:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
in the district to in the state and in
 
00:59:25.789 --> 00:59:25.799 align:start position:0%
response to representative Grossman's
 
00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
question yes it's the state now in view
 
00:59:30.829 --> 00:59:30.839 align:start position:0%
not just the District representative
 
00:59:30.839 --> 00:59:31.609 align:start position:0%
not just the District representative
long

00:59:31.609 --> 00:59:31.619 align:start position:0%
long
 
00:59:34.609 --> 00:59:34.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so yeah yeah it
 
00:59:36.829 --> 00:59:36.839 align:start position:0%
would be labor law people have a right
 
00:59:36.839 --> 00:59:37.730 align:start position:0%
would be labor law people have a right
to

00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:59:41.630 --> 00:59:41.640 align:start position:0%
work anywheres and original Amendment
 
00:59:44.030 --> 00:59:44.040 align:start position:0%
says that you would be allowed to work
 
00:59:46.549 --> 00:59:46.559 align:start position:0%
in other districts in the state so this
 
00:59:49.809 --> 00:59:49.819 align:start position:0%
takes you out of the state however
 
00:59:53.690 --> 00:59:53.700 align:start position:0%
uh on on this on a new one it says that
 
00:59:53.700 --> 00:59:54.289 align:start position:0%
uh on on this on a new one it says that
um

00:59:54.289 --> 00:59:54.299 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:57.650 --> 00:59:57.660 align:start position:0%
to all schools in the state so that's a
 
00:59:59.809 --> 00:59:59.819 align:start position:0%
private school a boarding school
 
01:00:03.410 --> 01:00:03.420 align:start position:0%
because the Declaration of purpose says
 
01:00:08.210 --> 01:00:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:11.329 --> 01:00:11.339 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry when you referenced this uh
 
01:00:13.549 --> 01:00:13.559 align:start position:0%
so evaluation Declaration of purpose on
 
01:00:16.730 --> 01:00:16.740 align:start position:0%
the first page uh actually it's in line
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
seven well being with the minor child in
 
01:00:21.770 --> 01:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
the custody of the school district so
 
01:00:23.510 --> 01:00:23.520 align:start position:0%
that at the beginning it specifies
 
01:00:26.089 --> 01:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
school district
 
01:00:28.490 --> 01:00:28.500 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:00:30.770 --> 01:00:30.780 align:start position:0%
and then at the end well not at the end
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
but the the punitive damage is all
 
01:00:37.069 --> 01:00:37.079 align:start position:0%
schools within the state
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm thinking a Catholic school I
 
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
can't teach at uh boarding school uh any
 
01:00:47.809 --> 01:00:47.819 align:start position:0%
any school that's not a state that's
 
01:00:50.450 --> 01:00:50.460 align:start position:0%
I could teach at any school that's not a
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
district in the school district
 
01:00:57.890 --> 01:00:57.900 align:start position:0%
so I'm not a lawyer but if in fact the
 
01:00:57.900 --> 01:00:59.329 align:start position:0%
so I'm not a lawyer but if in fact the
governing

01:00:59.329 --> 01:00:59.339 align:start position:0%
governing
 
01:01:03.589 --> 01:01:03.599 align:start position:0%
uh definition is provided in
 
01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:06.720 align:start position:0%
section one at the beginning of the bill
 
01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.470 align:start position:0%
section one at the beginning of the bill
then

01:01:09.470 --> 01:01:09.480 align:start position:0%
then
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
it may very well be interpreted that
 
01:01:17.630 --> 01:01:17.640 align:start position:0%
all schools in the state would apply to
 
01:01:20.089 --> 01:01:20.099 align:start position:0%
only those schools that are in view
 
01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:22.020 align:start position:0%
within section one
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
might not be actually the reverse that
 
01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:26.220 align:start position:0%
the Declaration of purpose is saying hi
 
01:01:28.370 --> 01:01:28.380 align:start position:0%
guys this is what we want to do and what
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
follows that is law
 
01:01:33.349 --> 01:01:33.359 align:start position:0%
even though it's all enshrined in the
 
01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
lsrs the Declaration of purpose is not
 
01:01:38.750 --> 01:01:38.760 align:start position:0%
determinative over any item in the body
 
01:01:41.510 --> 01:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
of it itself so that your page six would
 
01:01:43.970 --> 01:01:43.980 align:start position:0%
really be more Cooperative yes thank you
 
01:01:45.950 --> 01:01:45.960 align:start position:0%
for that uh observation and
 
01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:48.720 align:start position:0%
clarification I'm still clearing the
 
01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:51.720 align:start position:0%
snow from my mind so yeah I appreciate
 
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
that yes thank you any other questions
 
01:01:56.809 --> 01:01:56.819 align:start position:0%
on what the representative has said on
 
01:01:56.819 --> 01:01:57.650 align:start position:0%
on what the representative has said on
that

01:01:57.650 --> 01:01:57.660 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:01:57.660 --> 01:01:58.910 align:start position:0%
that
point

01:01:58.910 --> 01:01:58.920 align:start position:0%
point
 
01:02:00.890 --> 01:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
okay go to your third point please okay
 
01:02:04.390 --> 01:02:04.400 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford third and lastly
 
01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:06.720 align:start position:0%
representative Beckford raised the
 
01:02:08.870 --> 01:02:08.880 align:start position:0%
question at the at the at the first
 
01:02:11.930 --> 01:02:11.940 align:start position:0%
hearing at the hearing about
 
01:02:14.089 --> 01:02:14.099 align:start position:0%
um school resource officers
 
01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
whether they uh should be included or
 
01:02:19.430 --> 01:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
not what did we think
 
01:02:21.829 --> 01:02:21.839 align:start position:0%
we had not considered school resource
 
01:02:24.049 --> 01:02:24.059 align:start position:0%
officers any of us in the drafting of
 
01:02:26.750 --> 01:02:26.760 align:start position:0%
the bill however subsequently we've
 
01:02:29.470 --> 01:02:29.480 align:start position:0%
begun to do some research into
 
01:02:34.069 --> 01:02:34.079 align:start position:0%
the uh the role uh the role of the
 
01:02:36.950 --> 01:02:36.960 align:start position:0%
school resource officer or roles of the
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
school resource of school resource
 
01:02:42.950 --> 01:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
officers and also their relationships to
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
the school
 
01:02:48.109 --> 01:02:48.119 align:start position:0%
district into the uh the police
 
01:02:50.809 --> 01:02:50.819 align:start position:0%
department or departments which employ
 
01:02:53.150 --> 01:02:53.160 align:start position:0%
them and the problem here
 
01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
is that we cannot hold
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
the school resource officer to the same
 
01:03:02.569 --> 01:03:02.579 align:start position:0%
standard as we hold School District
 
01:03:05.870 --> 01:03:05.880 align:start position:0%
employees because this this student
 
01:03:09.230 --> 01:03:09.240 align:start position:0%
resource officer is not an employee of
 
01:03:11.930 --> 01:03:11.940 align:start position:0%
the school district he or she is there
 
01:03:14.690 --> 01:03:14.700 align:start position:0%
on contract
 
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
um with the local police law enforcement
 
01:03:22.849 --> 01:03:22.859 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction his or her primary
 
01:03:26.990 --> 01:03:27.000 align:start position:0%
relationship is therefore to the law
 
01:03:30.170 --> 01:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency and not to the school
 
01:03:30.180 --> 01:03:31.430 align:start position:0%
enforcement agency and not to the school
board

01:03:31.430 --> 01:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:03:34.730 --> 01:03:34.740 align:start position:0%
and so uh and and furthermore we're not
 
01:03:37.370 --> 01:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
real clear about
 
01:03:39.410 --> 01:03:39.420 align:start position:0%
um the roles and relationships of school
 
01:03:41.450 --> 01:03:41.460 align:start position:0%
resource officers in all the many many
 
01:03:44.450 --> 01:03:44.460 align:start position:0%
many many many many districts in uh in
 
01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:47.099 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire so if there were to be any
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
kind of concern about including school
 
01:03:52.630 --> 01:03:52.640 align:start position:0%
resource officers
 
01:03:56.089 --> 01:03:56.099 align:start position:0%
Under the Umbrella of this bill a lot
 
01:03:58.250 --> 01:03:58.260 align:start position:0%
more work needs to be done and and
 
01:04:00.230 --> 01:04:00.240 align:start position:0%
school resource officers here are not
 
01:04:02.950 --> 01:04:02.960 align:start position:0%
essential to this particular
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
bill as to whether it should be voted up
 
01:04:09.230 --> 01:04:09.240 align:start position:0%
or down representative long think of Mr
 
01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:10.789 align:start position:0%
or down representative long think of Mr
chairman

01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
01:04:13.849 --> 01:04:13.859 align:start position:0%
um so on the first page on line 23
 
01:04:16.910 --> 01:04:16.920 align:start position:0%
actually it's line 25 it includes other
 
01:04:19.370 --> 01:04:19.380 align:start position:0%
governmental entities in other
 
01:04:22.370 --> 01:04:22.380 align:start position:0%
institutions so
 
01:04:24.730 --> 01:04:24.740 align:start position:0%
like nurses are contracted
 
01:04:28.250 --> 01:04:28.260 align:start position:0%
uh well I know in Manchester uh you know
 
01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:31.260 align:start position:0%
actually we stopped Contracting and they
 
01:04:33.170 --> 01:04:33.180 align:start position:0%
belonged to the school district now uh
 
01:04:35.349 --> 01:04:35.359 align:start position:0%
but there were some districts that
 
01:04:38.870 --> 01:04:38.880 align:start position:0%
contract with nurses
 
01:04:43.010 --> 01:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
um and sros I would believe would be
 
01:04:51.109 --> 01:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:53.150 --> 01:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
oh that's quite possible and that makes
 
01:04:53.160 --> 01:04:54.289 align:start position:0%
oh that's quite possible and that makes
sense

01:04:54.289 --> 01:04:54.299 align:start position:0%
sense
 
01:04:56.990 --> 01:04:57.000 align:start position:0%
and so um I thank you for being helpful
 
01:04:58.190 --> 01:04:58.200 align:start position:0%
on that point
 
01:04:58.200 --> 01:04:59.809 align:start position:0%
on that point
uh

01:04:59.809 --> 01:04:59.819 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
clearly was something that we overlooked
 
01:05:06.289 --> 01:05:06.299 align:start position:0%
as we were as really zeroing in on the
 
01:05:10.010 --> 01:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
the question of the relationship of the
 
01:05:13.670 --> 01:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
student resource officer and uh clearly
 
01:05:16.069 --> 01:05:16.079 align:start position:0%
um apparently missed the reference here
 
01:05:18.049 --> 01:05:18.059 align:start position:0%
to governmental entity
 
01:05:21.710 --> 01:05:21.720 align:start position:0%
this was a multi-party effort and I I
 
01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
was I'm not trying to excuse myself but
 
01:05:25.970 --> 01:05:25.980 align:start position:0%
I wasn't particularly responsible for
 
01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
that section but I believe that's a good
 
01:05:31.010 --> 01:05:31.020 align:start position:0%
uh see on your part and I want I want to
 
01:05:32.630 --> 01:05:32.640 align:start position:0%
thank you for that
 
01:05:35.329 --> 01:05:35.339 align:start position:0%
would you prepared to run down to OLS
 
01:05:38.930 --> 01:05:38.940 align:start position:0%
and get this clarified so what we vote
 
01:05:41.930 --> 01:05:41.940 align:start position:0%
on will take into account what we just
 
01:05:41.940 --> 01:05:42.950 align:start position:0%
on will take into account what we just
heard

01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
they'll just have to change one line
 
01:05:47.809 --> 01:05:47.819 align:start position:0%
the one line being
 
01:05:52.010 --> 01:05:52.020 align:start position:0%
well uh somewhere where in you put in a
 
01:05:55.130 --> 01:05:55.140 align:start position:0%
clause not counting school resource to
 
01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:56.940 align:start position:0%
make it clear no no it's not in here no
 
01:05:58.910 --> 01:05:58.920 align:start position:0%
we we did not include School resources
 
01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:00.900 align:start position:0%
we didn't have to name them yeah but
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
line 25 indicates that it could be
 
01:06:05.450 --> 01:06:05.460 align:start position:0%
school resources if you're talking about
 
01:06:07.510 --> 01:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
any other governmental Essence
 
01:06:10.190 --> 01:06:10.200 align:start position:0%
Department would they not be covered
 
01:06:13.490 --> 01:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
already there's no need to actually
 
01:06:16.670 --> 01:06:16.680 align:start position:0%
reference them yeah I I mean even if you
 
01:06:19.309 --> 01:06:19.319 align:start position:0%
were to add sros then I would have other
 
01:06:21.530 --> 01:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
issues because I would not my son I
 
01:06:27.770 --> 01:06:27.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
writing out I can't think of another
 
01:06:33.410 --> 01:06:33.420 align:start position:0%
word I'd come from the get old so I
 
01:06:34.910 --> 01:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
can't think of another word for writing
 
01:06:36.829 --> 01:06:36.839 align:start position:0%
out I wouldn't I wouldn't want I
 
01:06:38.270 --> 01:06:38.280 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want my son
 
01:06:41.569 --> 01:06:41.579 align:start position:0%
my child to be ratting out uh
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
somebody so I would as a parent I would
 
01:06:46.309 --> 01:06:46.319 align:start position:0%
say to the SRO
 
01:06:49.190 --> 01:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
don't go after my don't go after my kid
 
01:06:50.930 --> 01:06:50.940 align:start position:0%
to get information on this kid I don't
 
01:06:53.089 --> 01:06:53.099 align:start position:0%
want my son telling any information on
 
01:06:55.609 --> 01:06:55.619 align:start position:0%
this child so I think that
 
01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
I think that creates a more it makes it
 
01:07:01.970 --> 01:07:01.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:06.010 --> 01:07:06.020 align:start position:0%
yeah you're not saying specifically
 
01:07:09.710 --> 01:07:09.720 align:start position:0%
ruling out sros as a line item would
 
01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:11.640 align:start position:0%
make any difference for you on the bill
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
so so there's no point okay any other
 
01:07:19.910 --> 01:07:19.920 align:start position:0%
questions for uh representative Terry on
 
01:07:25.549 --> 01:07:25.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.950 --> 01:07:29.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.450 --> 01:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
just the three changes so since nothing
 
01:07:35.510 --> 01:07:35.520 align:start position:0%
happened with sros it's not a change so
 
01:07:38.510 --> 01:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
it's the elimination of pursuant to
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
on page four I believe and then changing
 
01:07:44.210 --> 01:07:44.220 align:start position:0%
on Page Six
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
in The District in the state
 
01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:49.849 align:start position:0%
in The District in the state
yes

01:07:49.849 --> 01:07:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:51.849 --> 01:07:51.859 align:start position:0%
any further questions
 
01:07:54.230 --> 01:07:54.240 align:start position:0%

01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%

representative

01:09:11.150 --> 01:09:11.160 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:09:12.829 --> 01:09:12.839 align:start position:0%
um betrayal
 
01:09:16.370 --> 01:09:16.380 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman
 
01:09:19.490 --> 01:09:19.500 align:start position:0%
so we heard testimony uh last time
 
01:09:22.970 --> 01:09:22.980 align:start position:0%
regarding this bill and to quote
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
um one of the sponsors
 
01:09:29.269 --> 01:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
I believe he said everything else is
 
01:09:33.650 --> 01:09:33.660 align:start position:0%
already explicitly stated in the RSA
 
01:09:36.590 --> 01:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
everything else other than the
 
01:09:40.070 --> 01:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
provisions w x and y
 
01:09:42.829 --> 01:09:42.839 align:start position:0%
in other words
 
01:09:46.849 --> 01:09:46.859 align:start position:0%
parental rights already exist
 
01:09:51.050 --> 01:09:51.060 align:start position:0%
the entire Bill okay is such that every
 
01:09:54.650 --> 01:09:54.660 align:start position:0%
single right enumerated already exists
 
01:09:58.189 --> 01:09:58.199 align:start position:0%
for example the right to opt out of sex
 
01:09:58.199 --> 01:09:59.510 align:start position:0%
for example the right to opt out of sex
education

01:09:59.510 --> 01:09:59.520 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:10:01.610 --> 01:10:01.620 align:start position:0%
parents can already opt out of
 
01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:03.780 align:start position:0%
absolutely anything they don't want
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
their children to participate in and I
 
01:10:11.689 --> 01:10:11.699 align:start position:0%
can go line by line by line and argue
 
01:10:13.729 --> 01:10:13.739 align:start position:0%
the point that every single right
 
01:10:17.630 --> 01:10:17.640 align:start position:0%
enumerated already exists it makes this
 
01:10:20.030 --> 01:10:20.040 align:start position:0%
whole legislation really pointless
 
01:10:27.410 --> 01:10:27.420 align:start position:0%
except for W X and Y and W X and Y says
 
01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:28.910 align:start position:0%
except for W X and Y and W X and Y says
that

01:10:28.910 --> 01:10:28.920 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:32.990 --> 01:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
upon inquiry if a parent asks a teacher
 
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
a specific question
 
01:10:37.370 --> 01:10:37.380 align:start position:0%
the teacher must answer
 
01:10:41.510 --> 01:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
well that is not a right as a matter of
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
fact I was actually in a hearing in
 
01:10:44.750 --> 01:10:44.760 align:start position:0%
another committee where this whole
 
01:10:47.930 --> 01:10:47.940 align:start position:0%
discussion about natural inalienable
 
01:10:49.970 --> 01:10:49.980 align:start position:0%
rights was discussed
 
01:10:52.669 --> 01:10:52.679 align:start position:0%
and I was surprised to hear that one of
 
01:10:55.310 --> 01:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
the conservative members said
 
01:10:58.250 --> 01:10:58.260 align:start position:0%
no one has a right to force you to do
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
something against your will
 
01:11:04.610 --> 01:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
so I as a teacher if a parent comes to
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
me and says I want to know if my child
 
01:11:09.950 --> 01:11:09.960 align:start position:0%
has expressed to you concerns about
 
01:11:12.050 --> 01:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
gender identity
 
01:11:14.270 --> 01:11:14.280 align:start position:0%
I don't have to answer that
 
01:11:16.010 --> 01:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
and that is not really a matter of
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
keeping secrets
 
01:11:21.950 --> 01:11:21.960 align:start position:0%
ask me how is my kid doing is he turning
 
01:11:24.110 --> 01:11:24.120 align:start position:0%
in his homework is he paying attention
 
01:11:27.470 --> 01:11:27.480 align:start position:0%
in class and I will happily answer that
 
01:11:30.709 --> 01:11:30.719 align:start position:0%
but if you ask me
 
01:11:33.229 --> 01:11:33.239 align:start position:0%
has my child expressed concerns about
 
01:11:35.990 --> 01:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
their gender identity my response as a
 
01:11:38.270 --> 01:11:38.280 align:start position:0%
teacher would be I think you have to go
 
01:11:41.570 --> 01:11:41.580 align:start position:0%
home and talk to your child about that
 
01:11:44.450 --> 01:11:44.460 align:start position:0%
because kids and I taught for 40 years
 
01:11:46.610 --> 01:11:46.620 align:start position:0%
they come to their teachers and they
 
01:11:48.490 --> 01:11:48.500 align:start position:0%
talk about everything
 
01:11:51.649 --> 01:11:51.659 align:start position:0%
and they just need an adult where they
 
01:11:54.350 --> 01:11:54.360 align:start position:0%
can vent during their school day
 
01:11:56.750 --> 01:11:56.760 align:start position:0%
and there is no way I am going to
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
violate their confidentiality because
 
01:12:01.430 --> 01:12:01.440 align:start position:0%
once I do that they're never coming to
 
01:12:03.290 --> 01:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
me to talk to me about absolutely
 
01:12:03.300 --> 01:12:04.850 align:start position:0%
me to talk to me about absolutely
anything

01:12:04.850 --> 01:12:04.860 align:start position:0%
anything
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
and the reality is that there are kids
 
01:12:13.370 --> 01:12:13.380 align:start position:0%
who when outed go home and are abused by
 
01:12:15.110 --> 01:12:15.120 align:start position:0%
their parents
 
01:12:18.290 --> 01:12:18.300 align:start position:0%
and this is not just me saying so the
 
01:12:21.410 --> 01:12:21.420 align:start position:0%
child advocate testified and said that
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
and I'm quoting on a daily basis her
 
01:12:28.490 --> 01:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
office has instances of children who are
 
01:12:30.830 --> 01:12:30.840 align:start position:0%
abused by their parents once they find
 
01:12:32.570 --> 01:12:32.580 align:start position:0%
out that they're having questions about
 
01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
their gender identity
 
01:12:34.679 --> 01:12:35.930 align:start position:0%
their gender identity
so

01:12:35.930 --> 01:12:35.940 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
why w x and y are not inalienable rights
 
01:12:43.970 --> 01:12:43.980 align:start position:0%
to call them rights and to put them in a
 
01:12:46.910 --> 01:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
Bill of Rights when they are not rights
 
01:12:49.070 --> 01:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
just take that completely out of the
 
01:12:51.290 --> 01:12:51.300 align:start position:0%
equation they're not rights no one is
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
going to force me to say anything that I
 
01:12:56.870 --> 01:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
feel is in inappropriate
 
01:12:58.729 --> 01:12:58.739 align:start position:0%
all the other rights that are in there
 
01:13:01.130 --> 01:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
they already exist
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is meaningless
 
01:13:06.830 --> 01:13:06.840 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:10.130 --> 01:13:10.140 align:start position:0%
representative D Simone
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
when we had a a similar Bill last term
 
01:13:20.510 --> 01:13:20.520 align:start position:0%
what I'm about to talk about was not in
 
01:13:22.310 --> 01:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
that bill and it did not protect the
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
children this particular Bill not only
 
01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
protects the parents
 
01:13:28.970 --> 01:13:28.980 align:start position:0%
and their rights but it also protects
 
01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:32.040 align:start position:0%
the children and if you go to page four
 
01:13:34.550 --> 01:13:34.560 align:start position:0%
line 25
 
01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:37.580 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral three it says
 
01:13:41.689 --> 01:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
this section does not and then it goes
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
on to specific a in B lowercase A and B
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
in paraphernal and then section
 
01:13:53.030 --> 01:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
um sections four five and so on
 
01:13:55.970 --> 01:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
it protects the children who are going
 
01:13:59.149 --> 01:13:59.159 align:start position:0%
to go home and be
 
01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
smacked or abused in any other manner
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
thrown out of the house whatever it also
 
01:14:10.610 --> 01:14:10.620 align:start position:0%
opens up dialogue so that there is a
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
teacher parent and a child being able to
 
01:14:18.950 --> 01:14:18.960 align:start position:0%
talk amongst themselves and the trained
 
01:14:23.149 --> 01:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
Professionals in the school can see
 
01:14:26.090 --> 01:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
If the child is in danger when they get
 
01:14:26.100 --> 01:14:27.470 align:start position:0%
If the child is in danger when they get
home

01:14:27.470 --> 01:14:27.480 align:start position:0%
home
 
01:14:30.169 --> 01:14:30.179 align:start position:0%
you know we're all born the way we're
 
01:14:30.179 --> 01:14:32.510 align:start position:0%
you know we're all born the way we're
born

01:14:32.510 --> 01:14:32.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.770 --> 01:14:36.780 align:start position:0%
and much of the testimony last week was
 
01:14:36.780 --> 01:14:38.870 align:start position:0%
and much of the testimony last week was
in

01:14:38.870 --> 01:14:38.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:14:43.450 --> 01:14:43.460 align:start position:0%
serious concern for the lgbtq
 
01:14:47.689 --> 01:14:47.699 align:start position:0%
transgender kids and so forth
 
01:14:51.010 --> 01:14:51.020 align:start position:0%
those kids are born the way they born
 
01:14:53.810 --> 01:14:53.820 align:start position:0%
they believe what in their heart they
 
01:14:56.209 --> 01:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
believe and
 
01:14:59.689 --> 01:14:59.699 align:start position:0%
it's up to the legislature to protect
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
those kids it's up to the legislature to
 
01:15:06.350 --> 01:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
protect the adults we don't know
 
01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:08.450 align:start position:0%
protect the adults we don't know
specifically

01:15:08.450 --> 01:15:08.460 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:15:11.810 --> 01:15:11.820 align:start position:0%
if those kids who are claiming to be
 
01:15:15.410 --> 01:15:15.420 align:start position:0%
transgender it's just a fad or it
 
01:15:17.870 --> 01:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
actually is that they are
 
01:15:21.229 --> 01:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
we can't make that determination but we
 
01:15:26.990 --> 01:15:27.000 align:start position:0%
can protect those kids so that's why
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
um section three on page four was put
 
01:15:34.189 --> 01:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
into the bill was to protect those kids
 
01:15:36.770 --> 01:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
and make sure
 
01:15:41.030 --> 01:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
that we're also protecting the parents
 
01:15:43.490 --> 01:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
and that's why I believe that this bill
 
01:15:46.790 --> 01:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
is relevant and it needs to be passed
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:51.649 --> 01:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
I'd like to let everybody have a chance
 
01:15:54.649 --> 01:15:54.659 align:start position:0%
to go around and then we can come back
 
01:15:57.410 --> 01:15:57.420 align:start position:0%
uh representative Raymond
 
01:15:59.090 --> 01:15:59.100 align:start position:0%
um thank you Mr chairman
 
01:16:01.970 --> 01:16:01.980 align:start position:0%
um to be clear we wouldn't need to have
 
01:16:03.950 --> 01:16:03.960 align:start position:0%
extra predictions for those kids if we
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
didn't have extra sections under w x and
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
y that specifically discriminate against
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
those children so it seems really
 
01:16:14.570 --> 01:16:14.580 align:start position:0%
counter-intuitive to me to specifically
 
01:16:17.090 --> 01:16:17.100 align:start position:0%
expand state law to add in
 
01:16:19.910 --> 01:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
discrimination against lgbtq Youth and
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
then a few paragraphs later be like oh
 
01:16:26.570 --> 01:16:26.580 align:start position:0%
but please don't abuse them we know very
 
01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
clearly that telling parents not to
 
01:16:33.050 --> 01:16:33.060 align:start position:0%
abuse their kids doesn't do anything to
 
01:16:35.750 --> 01:16:35.760 align:start position:0%
protect kids from abuse they get abused
 
01:16:38.570 --> 01:16:38.580 align:start position:0%
every day and we know
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
because many many experts medical
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
experts and psychological experts have
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
told us that lgbtq plus kids are at
 
01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
greater risk of both abuse and neglect
 
01:16:53.450 --> 01:16:53.460 align:start position:0%
and mental health issues including
 
01:16:53.460 --> 01:16:54.910 align:start position:0%
and mental health issues including
suicide

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
suicide
 
01:16:59.689 --> 01:16:59.699 align:start position:0%
because parents are more likely to
 
01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
reject them or treat them badly once
 
01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
they come out so if kids are saying it
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
is not safe for you to tell Mom and Dad
 
01:17:11.570 --> 01:17:11.580 align:start position:0%
that I'm having an issue with my gender
 
01:17:14.870 --> 01:17:14.880 align:start position:0%
identity it is completely irresponsible
 
01:17:17.390 --> 01:17:17.400 align:start position:0%
and frankly I think immoral for the
 
01:17:20.149 --> 01:17:20.159 align:start position:0%
state to step in and tell teachers too
 
01:17:20.159 --> 01:17:21.530 align:start position:0%
state to step in and tell teachers too
bad

01:17:21.530 --> 01:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
bad
 
01:17:24.229 --> 01:17:24.239 align:start position:0%
put your conscience to the side put
 
01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:27.540 align:start position:0%
reporting to dcyf and the police to the
 
01:17:29.810 --> 01:17:29.820 align:start position:0%
side until after you've informed the
 
01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:31.920 align:start position:0%
parents and if you don't we're going to
 
01:17:35.090 --> 01:17:35.100 align:start position:0%
impose criminal penalties on you that's
 
01:17:35.100 --> 01:17:36.470 align:start position:0%
impose criminal penalties on you that's
ridiculous

01:17:36.470 --> 01:17:36.480 align:start position:0%
ridiculous
 
01:17:38.689 --> 01:17:38.699 align:start position:0%
teachers are mandated reporters they're
 
01:17:41.149 --> 01:17:41.159 align:start position:0%
required to tell dcyf and the police if
 
01:17:44.030 --> 01:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
they have concerns let those experts do
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
their jobs don't put stuff into state
 
01:17:50.330 --> 01:17:50.340 align:start position:0%
law that's based on a few legislators
 
01:17:52.130 --> 01:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
personal beliefs thank you
 
01:17:55.729 --> 01:17:55.739 align:start position:0%
representative representative Nelson
 
01:17:58.370 --> 01:17:58.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have a few
 
01:18:00.110 --> 01:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
points to bring up
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
um first thing is that I think all of
 
01:18:05.270 --> 01:18:05.280 align:start position:0%
you know I try to research these
 
01:18:08.149 --> 01:18:08.159 align:start position:0%
feels very thoroughly in Seal sides I
 
01:18:11.630 --> 01:18:11.640 align:start position:0%
have heard from and I have spoken with
 
01:18:16.070 --> 01:18:16.080 align:start position:0%
people from the lgbtq plus community
 
01:18:18.890 --> 01:18:18.900 align:start position:0%
who are against this bill and I have
 
01:18:21.110 --> 01:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
also spoken to people from this
 
01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
community who are for this bill
 
01:18:27.310 --> 01:18:27.320 align:start position:0%
I want to also talk about
 
01:18:31.370 --> 01:18:31.380 align:start position:0%
my experience as a parent time has gone
 
01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:34.440 align:start position:0%
by I will not reveal the um
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
the name of this person I think that
 
01:18:41.510 --> 01:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
this person's anonymity will be safe
 
01:18:44.750 --> 01:18:44.760 align:start position:0%
my daughter several years ago came home
 
01:18:50.030 --> 01:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
from school and said Mom my friend
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
long time friend has changed their name
 
01:18:58.250 --> 01:18:58.260 align:start position:0%
and they will now be a girl name instead
 
01:19:01.970 --> 01:19:01.980 align:start position:0%
of a boy name and they are wearing a
 
01:19:03.950 --> 01:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
dress today it was the first day and
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
they will be dressing like a girl
 
01:19:09.290 --> 01:19:09.300 align:start position:0%
my daughter is very kind I raise my
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
children to be kind and so my response
 
01:19:13.250 --> 01:19:13.260 align:start position:0%
to her was I hope you will continue to
 
01:19:15.470 --> 01:19:15.480 align:start position:0%
be a good friend and be a support to
 
01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
your friend and she was my point of
 
01:19:22.010 --> 01:19:22.020 align:start position:0%
talking about my experience is that
 
01:19:23.770 --> 01:19:23.780 align:start position:0%
um when a child
 
01:19:27.350 --> 01:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
is asking the school Community to refer
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
to them by another name
 
01:19:33.110 --> 01:19:33.120 align:start position:0%
or another gender pronoun they're outing
 
01:19:35.570 --> 01:19:35.580 align:start position:0%
themselves in the school Community kids
 
01:19:38.630 --> 01:19:38.640 align:start position:0%
go home and they share things with their
 
01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:41.630 align:start position:0%
go home and they share things with their
parents

01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:44.689 --> 01:19:44.699 align:start position:0%
there is a good chance that the majority
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
of the people in the community will know
 
01:19:50.570 --> 01:19:50.580 align:start position:0%
that this child has outed themselves at
 
01:19:52.910 --> 01:19:52.920 align:start position:0%
school but the parents will not have the
 
01:19:56.570 --> 01:19:56.580 align:start position:0%
opportunity if they have a feeling that
 
01:20:00.590 --> 01:20:00.600 align:start position:0%
their child might be they will not be
 
01:20:02.930 --> 01:20:02.940 align:start position:0%
given the opportunity to have an honest
 
01:20:06.410 --> 01:20:06.420 align:start position:0%
answer come from the school we heard in
 
01:20:09.410 --> 01:20:09.420 align:start position:0%
testimony earlier in the day about a
 
01:20:11.270 --> 01:20:11.280 align:start position:0%
separate bill
 
01:20:15.229 --> 01:20:15.239 align:start position:0%
about the importance of a parent being
 
01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
afforded the opportunity to provide
 
01:20:19.800 --> 01:20:21.169 align:start position:0%
afforded the opportunity to provide
um

01:20:21.169 --> 01:20:21.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:24.790 --> 01:20:24.800 align:start position:0%
support to their children
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
because the incident of unsupported uh
 
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
transgender youth the incidence of
 
01:20:33.830 --> 01:20:33.840 align:start position:0%
suicide is exponentially increased when
 
01:20:35.510 --> 01:20:35.520 align:start position:0%
they're not supported by their parents
 
01:20:40.130 --> 01:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
yet in the afternoon we heard that
 
01:20:42.350 --> 01:20:42.360 align:start position:0%
parents shouldn't be given the
 
01:20:44.930 --> 01:20:44.940 align:start position:0%
opportunity to support their children or
 
01:20:48.169 --> 01:20:48.179 align:start position:0%
their children will commit suicide
 
01:20:51.410 --> 01:20:51.420 align:start position:0%
um so I my last thing is that if a child
 
01:20:53.990 --> 01:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
comes to an educator or another person
 
01:20:55.750 --> 01:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the school and says
 
01:20:57.410 --> 01:20:57.420 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
my situation if my parent calls and asks
 
01:21:04.550 --> 01:21:04.560 align:start position:0%
you they're going to abuse me isn't it
 
01:21:04.560 --> 01:21:05.689 align:start position:0%
you they're going to abuse me isn't it
um their

01:21:05.689 --> 01:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
um their
 
01:21:05.699 --> 01:21:06.729 align:start position:0%
um their
their

01:21:06.729 --> 01:21:06.739 align:start position:0%
their
 
01:21:09.890 --> 01:21:09.900 align:start position:0%
responsibility as a mandated reporter to
 
01:21:12.410 --> 01:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
report that statement thank you
 
01:21:14.270 --> 01:21:14.280 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson representative
 
01:21:16.850 --> 01:21:16.860 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman
 
01:21:19.310 --> 01:21:19.320 align:start position:0%
um this hits deeply personal basically
 
01:21:21.169 --> 01:21:21.179 align:start position:0%
because the 16 year old that was very
 
01:21:23.090 --> 01:21:23.100 align:start position:0%
brave and came in and shared with you
 
01:21:25.550 --> 01:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
guys happens to be my daughter we were
 
01:21:27.110 --> 01:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
in that situation
 
01:21:29.149 --> 01:21:29.159 align:start position:0%
I not only worked within my own family
 
01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
my own children as to how to get them
 
01:21:33.169 --> 01:21:33.179 align:start position:0%
out of our situation I've worked with
 
01:21:36.530 --> 01:21:36.540 align:start position:0%
hundreds of women who have children who
 
01:21:38.630 --> 01:21:38.640 align:start position:0%
go through this kind of situation
 
01:21:40.669 --> 01:21:40.679 align:start position:0%
I think that it's honorable that
 
01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:42.780 align:start position:0%
representative DeSimone says that you
 
01:21:44.570 --> 01:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
know she doesn't want kids to get abused
 
01:21:46.370 --> 01:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
doesn't want them to get hurt and she
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
thinks that that you know couple lines
 
01:21:51.010 --> 01:21:51.020 align:start position:0%
will make the difference unfortunately
 
01:21:53.990 --> 01:21:54.000 align:start position:0%
these parents already know that this
 
01:21:55.850 --> 01:21:55.860 align:start position:0%
probably isn't okay and this is why they
 
01:21:57.649 --> 01:21:57.659 align:start position:0%
have secrets however they don't
 
01:21:59.750 --> 01:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily look at it as abuse they
 
01:22:01.490 --> 01:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
look at it as control
 
01:22:03.890 --> 01:22:03.900 align:start position:0%
I'm going to spank you I'm going to beat
 
01:22:05.570 --> 01:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
you because you're out of control you're
 
01:22:08.390 --> 01:22:08.400 align:start position:0%
not doing something within my control
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
if you heard Emma Greg say the other day
 
01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
and she she did quote it we had some
 
01:22:14.510 --> 01:22:14.520 align:start position:0%
statistics come in that we've never
 
01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:16.500 align:start position:0%
gotten proof of we've had some oh
 
01:22:18.110 --> 01:22:18.120 align:start position:0%
there's many cases none of us have
 
01:22:20.450 --> 01:22:20.460 align:start position:0%
gotten any information that we asked for
 
01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:22.080 align:start position:0%
however she said the National Children's
 
01:22:25.850 --> 01:22:25.860 align:start position:0%
Alliance in 2020 out of the 618 000
 
01:22:27.850 --> 01:22:27.860 align:start position:0%
children were victims of abuse
 
01:22:33.050 --> 01:22:33.060 align:start position:0%
77 percent of them were by the parents
 
01:22:35.570 --> 01:22:35.580 align:start position:0%
which leaves very little room for
 
01:22:37.729 --> 01:22:37.739 align:start position:0%
everything else whether it be teachers
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
or whatever else in the abuse teachers
 
01:22:41.330 --> 01:22:41.340 align:start position:0%
are not perfect however
 
01:22:44.090 --> 01:22:44.100 align:start position:0%
I do know and I would be surprised that
 
01:22:45.950 --> 01:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
anybody who's worked with abuse victims
 
01:22:48.530 --> 01:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
doesn't know that a child never is able
 
01:22:50.990 --> 01:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
to come out because of the brow beating
 
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
that they get mentally and say hey you
 
01:22:56.149 --> 01:22:56.159 align:start position:0%
know what I'm abused what children do is
 
01:22:58.850 --> 01:22:58.860 align:start position:0%
they do a test reveal it is something
 
01:23:01.310 --> 01:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
that might be a little bit not like hey
 
01:23:02.810 --> 01:23:02.820 align:start position:0%
I had peanut butter and jelly at home
 
01:23:04.490 --> 01:23:04.500 align:start position:0%
but it's going to be something a little
 
01:23:07.189 --> 01:23:07.199 align:start position:0%
bit closer my own children did this they
 
01:23:09.770 --> 01:23:09.780 align:start position:0%
see if they can trust what's going to
 
01:23:12.649 --> 01:23:12.659 align:start position:0%
happen what the response will be will
 
01:23:15.169 --> 01:23:15.179 align:start position:0%
their parents find out if they don't
 
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:17.219 align:start position:0%
find out you'll get a reveal like I did
 
01:23:19.490 --> 01:23:19.500 align:start position:0%
one year when a little boy finally told
 
01:23:21.709 --> 01:23:21.719 align:start position:0%
me that his dad his new stepdad was
 
01:23:23.149 --> 01:23:23.159 align:start position:0%
waking him up in the middle of the night
 
01:23:26.030 --> 01:23:26.040 align:start position:0%
it took three questionable things of him
 
01:23:27.410 --> 01:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
telling me things that were kind of like
 
01:23:29.870 --> 01:23:29.880 align:start position:0%
weird like hey I lost all my toys before
 
01:23:31.729 --> 01:23:31.739 align:start position:0%
he finally trusted me enough to tell me
 
01:23:33.890 --> 01:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
that there are test questions we are
 
01:23:36.290 --> 01:23:36.300 align:start position:0%
taking that protection away from these
 
01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
children 77 percent of these that are
 
01:23:40.370 --> 01:23:40.380 align:start position:0%
getting abused by their parents thank
 
01:23:40.380 --> 01:23:46.010 align:start position:0%
getting abused by their parents thank
you

01:23:46.010 --> 01:23:46.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:50.570 --> 01:23:50.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman best interest of
 
01:23:52.850 --> 01:23:52.860 align:start position:0%
the child
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.030 --> 01:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
uh Moulton representative ball
 
01:24:00.890 --> 01:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman when we talk about
 
01:24:02.689 --> 01:24:02.699 align:start position:0%
the best interest of the child we really
 
01:24:04.490 --> 01:24:04.500 align:start position:0%
should be thinking about the fact that
 
01:24:07.729 --> 01:24:07.739 align:start position:0%
our teachers are employees at will they
 
01:24:09.590 --> 01:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
are there to teach the curriculum they
 
01:24:12.290 --> 01:24:12.300 align:start position:0%
are not trained to be counselors and
 
01:24:14.030 --> 01:24:14.040 align:start position:0%
they should not be expected to be
 
01:24:16.610 --> 01:24:16.620 align:start position:0%
counselors when a student goes to a
 
01:24:18.890 --> 01:24:18.900 align:start position:0%
teacher and confides in them anything
 
01:24:22.370 --> 01:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
that student should be referred to the
 
01:24:24.770 --> 01:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
counselor in the school if the student
 
01:24:26.990 --> 01:24:27.000 align:start position:0%
is saying that they
 
01:24:31.189 --> 01:24:31.199 align:start position:0%
feel anxiety depression suicidal that is
 
01:24:33.709 --> 01:24:33.719 align:start position:0%
the reason teachers refer to special
 
01:24:35.990 --> 01:24:36.000 align:start position:0%
education for a social emotional
 
01:24:38.149 --> 01:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
disability it means there is something
 
01:24:40.669 --> 01:24:40.679 align:start position:0%
getting in the way of that child
 
01:24:43.010 --> 01:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
to access the curriculum and if they're
 
01:24:46.250 --> 01:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
talking to teachers about situations it
 
01:24:49.189 --> 01:24:49.199 align:start position:0%
is not the teacher's responsibility to
 
01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
take on that child
 
01:24:52.490 --> 01:24:52.500 align:start position:0%
as their
 
01:24:54.830 --> 01:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
someone they're going to counsel that is
 
01:24:57.530 --> 01:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
beyond what is expected of a teacher in
 
01:24:59.570 --> 01:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
a public school it is beyond what a
 
01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
parent expects they expect their child
 
01:25:03.770 --> 01:25:03.780 align:start position:0%
to see a counselor they expect their
 
01:25:05.209 --> 01:25:05.219 align:start position:0%
child to get referred to special
 
01:25:07.610 --> 01:25:07.620 align:start position:0%
education to deal with any kind of
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
Social and emotional issues including
 
01:25:11.870 --> 01:25:11.880 align:start position:0%
anxiety depression and suicide
 
01:25:14.750 --> 01:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
so I am very concerned that when we keep
 
01:25:16.970 --> 01:25:16.980 align:start position:0%
talking about teachers addressing our
 
01:25:18.649 --> 01:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
children that we are changing our
 
01:25:20.930 --> 01:25:20.940 align:start position:0%
educational institutions into mental
 
01:25:23.450 --> 01:25:23.460 align:start position:0%
health facilities and that is not what
 
01:25:24.649 --> 01:25:24.659 align:start position:0%
they are there for
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
so let's think of the best interest of
 
01:25:28.790 --> 01:25:28.800 align:start position:0%
the child and direct the child to the
 
01:25:31.729 --> 01:25:31.739 align:start position:0%
people in the school system who can be
 
01:25:34.669 --> 01:25:34.679 align:start position:0%
best trained to address their concerns
 
01:25:37.010 --> 01:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative Perez who had your hand
 
01:25:38.760 --> 01:25:40.610 align:start position:0%
representative Perez who had your hand
up

01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
up
 
01:25:43.729 --> 01:25:43.739 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Sherman I'm very concerned
 
01:25:45.890 --> 01:25:45.900 align:start position:0%
I'm very concerned if we pass this bill
 
01:25:48.470 --> 01:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
let me tell you why
 
01:25:50.870 --> 01:25:50.880 align:start position:0%
this will take the ability your
 
01:25:50.880 --> 01:25:52.070 align:start position:0%
this will take the ability your
children's

01:25:52.070 --> 01:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
children's
 
01:25:54.530 --> 01:25:54.540 align:start position:0%
to be able to cheer
 
01:25:57.470 --> 01:25:57.480 align:start position:0%
the abuse they're getting at home
 
01:25:59.930 --> 01:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes from a parent
 
01:26:01.610 --> 01:26:01.620 align:start position:0%
you're not speaking
 
01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:08.750 --> 01:26:08.760 align:start position:0%
I already testified many times and
 
01:26:11.570 --> 01:26:11.580 align:start position:0%
already shared my story
 
01:26:14.209 --> 01:26:14.219 align:start position:0%
thou will take away
 
01:26:17.330 --> 01:26:17.340 align:start position:0%
the riot child like myself
 
01:26:20.510 --> 01:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
to be safe why did we keep saying that
 
01:26:22.729 --> 01:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
we want to keep the kids safe this is
 
01:26:24.410 --> 01:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
not the bill that is going to keep the
 
01:26:27.290 --> 01:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
kid safe this is against the safe of the
 
01:26:29.510 --> 01:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
child and this is against
 
01:26:31.669 --> 01:26:31.679 align:start position:0%
oh that say for the all the teachers
 
01:26:33.530 --> 01:26:33.540 align:start position:0%
because this is putting the teachers and
 
01:26:37.669 --> 01:26:37.679 align:start position:0%
rests not just to penalize and paying
 
01:26:39.770 --> 01:26:39.780 align:start position:0%
these twenty five hundred dollars
 
01:26:42.050 --> 01:26:42.060 align:start position:0%
but this kind of language
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
is not making for the teachers to be
 
01:26:46.070 --> 01:26:46.080 align:start position:0%
safe or anyone who worked in the school
 
01:26:49.310 --> 01:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
system to be feel safe we already know
 
01:26:51.050 --> 01:26:51.060 align:start position:0%
the attacks in the school system and
 
01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:58.490 --> 01:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:26:58.500 --> 01:27:00.470 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
panic

01:27:00.470 --> 01:27:00.480 align:start position:0%
panic
 
01:27:02.930 --> 01:27:02.940 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson for allowing
 
01:27:11.390 --> 01:27:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:13.790 --> 01:27:13.800 align:start position:0%
is the public schools a government
 
01:27:13.800 --> 01:27:16.129 align:start position:0%
is the public schools a government
program

01:27:16.129 --> 01:27:16.139 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:27:20.209 --> 01:27:20.219 align:start position:0%
it's is this a government overreach to
 
01:27:23.750 --> 01:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
separate children from parents
 
01:27:28.310 --> 01:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
to hide what is being taught
 
01:27:31.910 --> 01:27:31.920 align:start position:0%
when China fell to Communism in 1949 the
 
01:27:36.290 --> 01:27:36.300 align:start position:0%
first thing the CCP did is take over the
 
01:27:36.300 --> 01:27:38.330 align:start position:0%
first thing the CCP did is take over the
schools

01:27:38.330 --> 01:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
so when we have division between the
 
01:27:40.920 --> 01:27:43.430 align:start position:0%
so when we have division between the
parents

01:27:43.430 --> 01:27:43.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:45.410 --> 01:27:45.420 align:start position:0%
in the children
 
01:27:49.370 --> 01:27:49.380 align:start position:0%
in the schools being the wedge
 
01:27:52.070 --> 01:27:52.080 align:start position:0%
this is when we lose our country
 
01:27:53.810 --> 01:27:53.820 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:27:56.270 --> 01:27:56.280 align:start position:0%
thank you representative
 
01:27:58.970 --> 01:27:58.980 align:start position:0%
representative Levesque
 
01:28:02.629 --> 01:28:02.639 align:start position:0%
as someone who is is very young compared
 
01:28:05.990 --> 01:28:06.000 align:start position:0%
to many of you being in school was very
 
01:28:07.790 --> 01:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
recent for me
 
01:28:09.709 --> 01:28:09.719 align:start position:0%
I had a teacher who let me and a couple
 
01:28:11.810 --> 01:28:11.820 align:start position:0%
other students go up to his classroom
 
01:28:14.450 --> 01:28:14.460 align:start position:0%
during lunch because he understood that
 
01:28:16.850 --> 01:28:16.860 align:start position:0%
the cafeteria can sometimes be a little
 
01:28:18.590 --> 01:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
bit overwhelming for some of us and he
 
01:28:21.350 --> 01:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
allowed us to come and eat upstairs he
 
01:28:23.470 --> 01:28:23.480 align:start position:0%
gave us a hall pass
 
01:28:27.169 --> 01:28:27.179 align:start position:0%
and I trusted him I trusted many of my
 
01:28:29.810 --> 01:28:29.820 align:start position:0%
teachers who were there supervising me
 
01:28:31.810 --> 01:28:31.820 align:start position:0%
giving me my education
 
01:28:35.090 --> 01:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
and having that trust taken away with
 
01:28:39.050 --> 01:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
this bill is very very scary thank you
 
01:28:41.689 --> 01:28:41.699 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:28:41.699 --> 01:28:44.689 align:start position:0%

um
 
01:28:50.750 --> 01:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
to echo on so much of what we've already
 
01:28:50.760 --> 01:28:53.450 align:start position:0%
to echo on so much of what we've already
heard

01:28:53.450 --> 01:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:55.189 --> 01:28:55.199 align:start position:0%
and from the office of the child
 
01:28:58.430 --> 01:28:58.440 align:start position:0%
advocate we heard that this bill would
 
01:29:00.590 --> 01:29:00.600 align:start position:0%
harm children
 
01:29:03.169 --> 01:29:03.179 align:start position:0%
um and I just want to reiterate this
 
01:29:07.610 --> 01:29:07.620 align:start position:0%
harms our lgbtq youth this harms
 
01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:10.850 align:start position:0%
harms our lgbtq youth this harms
educators

01:29:10.850 --> 01:29:10.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:13.910 --> 01:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
this is not good for New Hampshire and
 
01:29:18.410 --> 01:29:18.420 align:start position:0%
for our students and so I will be voting
 
01:29:18.420 --> 01:29:19.490 align:start position:0%
for our students and so I will be voting
against

01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:22.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:24.709 --> 01:29:24.719 align:start position:0%
anybody who has not spoken in this round
 
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
yet like representative law
 
01:29:30.950 --> 01:29:30.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
01:29:34.370 --> 01:29:34.380 align:start position:0%
I'm kind of at odds as why this is only
 
01:29:36.470 --> 01:29:36.480 align:start position:0%
towards public teachers because I sent
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
my child to private school and I didn't
 
01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
have parental rights in that private
 
01:29:42.709 --> 01:29:42.719 align:start position:0%
school so I I don't know what we're
 
01:29:46.090 --> 01:29:46.100 align:start position:0%
trying to fix here uh and and
 
01:29:48.169 --> 01:29:48.179 align:start position:0%
representative girl Smith had it right I
 
01:29:50.750 --> 01:29:50.760 align:start position:0%
mean I asked everybody to read that uh
 
01:29:53.570 --> 01:29:53.580 align:start position:0%
uh the child the child Advocates uh
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
communication I mean it's it's just
 
01:29:59.270 --> 01:29:59.280 align:start position:0%
clear in here uh a couple short years
 
01:30:01.310 --> 01:30:01.320 align:start position:0%
ago we uh
 
01:30:05.090 --> 01:30:05.100 align:start position:0%
we added to 169 C the child protection
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
act best interest of the child you know
 
01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
we added more of the best interests of
 
01:30:11.810 --> 01:30:11.820 align:start position:0%
the child uh we also
 
01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:12.590 align:start position:0%

um

01:30:12.590 --> 01:30:12.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
uh the governor and Council has has also
 
01:30:20.149 --> 01:30:20.159 align:start position:0%
contracted uh with the one trusted adult
 
01:30:22.310 --> 01:30:22.320 align:start position:0%
program this is kicking out right out
 
01:30:24.229 --> 01:30:24.239 align:start position:0%
the window there will be no trusted
 
01:30:24.239 --> 01:30:25.430 align:start position:0%
the window there will be no trusted
adults

01:30:25.430 --> 01:30:25.440 align:start position:0%
adults
 
01:30:28.010 --> 01:30:28.020 align:start position:0%
uh and finally the the
 
01:30:28.020 --> 01:30:28.790 align:start position:0%
uh and finally the the
um

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:31.189 --> 01:30:31.199 align:start position:0%

according to the office of child
 
01:30:41.149 --> 01:30:41.159 align:start position:0%
advocate which I agree with this has
 
01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:44.400 align:start position:0%
this has nothing in the best interest of
 
01:30:47.629 --> 01:30:47.639 align:start position:0%
the child I hear it but it has nothing
 
01:30:49.310 --> 01:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
in the bill with respect to the best
 
01:30:51.110 --> 01:30:51.120 align:start position:0%

Petrino

thank you Mr chairman a couple of points
 
01:31:01.739 --> 01:31:02.810 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman a couple of points
um

01:31:02.810 --> 01:31:02.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned before I've had students
 
01:31:07.070 --> 01:31:07.080 align:start position:0%
come to me and discuss all kinds of
 
01:31:07.080 --> 01:31:07.910 align:start position:0%
come to me and discuss all kinds of
things

01:31:07.910 --> 01:31:07.920 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:31:09.649 --> 01:31:09.659 align:start position:0%
and again
 
01:31:12.470 --> 01:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
you know you hold their
 
01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:14.570 align:start position:0%
you know you hold their
confidentiality

01:31:14.570 --> 01:31:14.580 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
01:31:16.430 --> 01:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
if it's something like
 
01:31:20.270 --> 01:31:20.280 align:start position:0%
God forbid suicide or anything like that
 
01:31:22.430 --> 01:31:22.440 align:start position:0%
teaches them not in a position to
 
01:31:25.729 --> 01:31:25.739 align:start position:0%
counsel so you do
 
01:31:28.010 --> 01:31:28.020 align:start position:0%
speak to guidance counselors and all of
 
01:31:30.350 --> 01:31:30.360 align:start position:0%
those appropriate
 
01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:33.480 align:start position:0%
personnel but you know I just think of a
 
01:31:36.890 --> 01:31:36.900 align:start position:0%
young couple seniors a boy and girl who
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
were dating and they decided to break up
 
01:31:40.970 --> 01:31:40.980 align:start position:0%
because they knew it was inevitable they
 
01:31:42.830 --> 01:31:42.840 align:start position:0%
were going to be great breaking up at uh
 
01:31:44.990 --> 01:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
graduation anyways moving on to
 
01:31:46.850 --> 01:31:46.860 align:start position:0%
different colleges and they came to me
 
01:31:50.030 --> 01:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
to confide and I said you know it's the
 
01:31:51.830 --> 01:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
middle of the school year you know why
 
01:31:53.390 --> 01:31:53.400 align:start position:0%
don't you just enjoy your senior year
 
01:31:54.709 --> 01:31:54.719 align:start position:0%
and see what happens
 
01:31:56.629 --> 01:31:56.639 align:start position:0%
they took my advice they thanked me
 
01:31:58.669 --> 01:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
today they're married
 
01:32:00.709 --> 01:32:00.719 align:start position:0%
my only regret is they didn't name their
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
firstborn child after me
 
01:32:05.709 --> 01:32:05.719 align:start position:0%
to be quite honest
 
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
so teachers do more than just sit there
 
01:32:12.350 --> 01:32:12.360 align:start position:0%
and play the role of psychiatrists it's
 
01:32:14.450 --> 01:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
not their role but kids do talk to you
 
01:32:16.070 --> 01:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
about all kinds of things and you want
 
01:32:19.070 --> 01:32:19.080 align:start position:0%
to maintain that relationship and the
 
01:32:21.169 --> 01:32:21.179 align:start position:0%
issue here is the relationship between
 
01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:23.520 align:start position:0%
the parent and the child there are many
 
01:32:25.490 --> 01:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
children who willingly speak to their
 
01:32:27.830 --> 01:32:27.840 align:start position:0%
parents about issues regarding gender
 
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
identity they do so because they feel
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
comfortable they kind of get a sense
 
01:32:35.750 --> 01:32:35.760 align:start position:0%
that Mom and Dad are okay with this and
 
01:32:37.370 --> 01:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
so they reveal it
 
01:32:39.470 --> 01:32:39.480 align:start position:0%
the children who don't
 
01:32:41.750 --> 01:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
talk to Mom and Dad and kind of feel
 
01:32:44.330 --> 01:32:44.340 align:start position:0%
things out at school are the ones who
 
01:32:46.550 --> 01:32:46.560 align:start position:0%
really worry that Mom and Dad are going
 
01:32:49.189 --> 01:32:49.199 align:start position:0%
to be abusive when is the right time for
 
01:32:51.890 --> 01:32:51.900 align:start position:0%
me to come out is my dad going to freak
 
01:32:54.229 --> 01:32:54.239 align:start position:0%
out but I still gotta
 
01:32:56.629 --> 01:32:56.639 align:start position:0%
express myself somehow maybe what my
 
01:32:59.330 --> 01:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
friends or some teachers or whatever
 
01:33:01.729 --> 01:33:01.739 align:start position:0%
so the parent-child relationship is very
 
01:33:03.770 --> 01:33:03.780 align:start position:0%
important and many children do come out
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
willingly and others are rightly so a
 
01:33:10.550 --> 01:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
little fearful okay and we need to take
 
01:33:12.350 --> 01:33:12.360 align:start position:0%
that into consideration
 
01:33:14.209 --> 01:33:14.219 align:start position:0%
and lastly
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
again you take a look at why W Y X and Y
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be over dramatic here
 
01:33:24.290 --> 01:33:24.300 align:start position:0%
but it almost reminds me of gestapo
 
01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:25.729 align:start position:0%
but it almost reminds me of gestapo
tactics

01:33:25.729 --> 01:33:25.739 align:start position:0%
tactics
 
01:33:29.209 --> 01:33:29.219 align:start position:0%
tell me what I want to know
 
01:33:29.219 --> 01:33:30.890 align:start position:0%
tell me what I want to know
otherwise

01:33:30.890 --> 01:33:30.900 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
01:33:34.430 --> 01:33:34.440 align:start position:0%
your life is in Jeopardy I can again not
 
01:33:36.709 --> 01:33:36.719 align:start position:0%
wanting to be very dramatic here but you
 
01:33:38.930 --> 01:33:38.940 align:start position:0%
put a gun to someone's head and say tell
 
01:33:41.930 --> 01:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
me what I want to know in this instance
 
01:33:45.590 --> 01:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
tell me what I want to know or you are
 
01:33:47.570 --> 01:33:47.580 align:start position:0%
subject to civil and criminal liability
 
01:33:49.550 --> 01:33:49.560 align:start position:0%
and you're going to lose your job so
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
tell me what I want to know and again
 
01:33:57.470 --> 01:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
those are not inalienable rights to put
 
01:33:58.850 --> 01:33:58.860 align:start position:0%
them in a Bill of Rights and call them
 
01:34:00.290 --> 01:34:00.300 align:start position:0%
rights when they're not rights and this
 
01:34:02.090 --> 01:34:02.100 align:start position:0%
is not just me look it up in any
 
01:34:05.870 --> 01:34:05.880 align:start position:0%
conservative uh Forum that discusses the
 
01:34:08.330 --> 01:34:08.340 align:start position:0%
concept of natural inalienable rights
 
01:34:11.149 --> 01:34:11.159 align:start position:0%
conservatives will tell you these are
 
01:34:13.610 --> 01:34:13.620 align:start position:0%
not rights and all the other rights that
 
01:34:18.229 --> 01:34:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:20.149 --> 01:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
thank you representative and the chair
 
01:34:23.209 --> 01:34:23.219 align:start position:0%
apologizes that in the flurry of paper
 
01:34:26.570 --> 01:34:26.580 align:start position:0%
that came in last week the testimony
 
01:34:29.209 --> 01:34:29.219 align:start position:0%
from the last individual
 
01:34:29.219 --> 01:34:31.149 align:start position:0%
from the last individual
um

01:34:31.149 --> 01:34:31.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:34:35.030 --> 01:34:35.040 align:start position:0%
was not handed out so I'm sending around
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
a batch of these to to you
 
01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:41.450 align:start position:0%
a batch of these to to you
um

01:34:41.450 --> 01:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:44.390 --> 01:34:44.400 align:start position:0%
this was from the person who starts off
 
01:34:46.610 --> 01:34:46.620 align:start position:0%
saying I was a transgender woman for
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
over 20 years and ends with to hide
 
01:34:51.470 --> 01:34:51.480 align:start position:0%
irreversible and damaging mental or
 
01:34:53.810 --> 01:34:53.820 align:start position:0%
medical therapy or procedures about a
 
01:34:55.910 --> 01:34:55.920 align:start position:0%
child to his her parents is above and
 
01:34:58.129 --> 01:34:58.139 align:start position:0%
beyond criminal it must be stopped
 
01:35:00.709 --> 01:35:00.719 align:start position:0%
that you may remember some of you had to
 
01:35:03.530 --> 01:35:03.540 align:start position:0%
leave but that was the last
 
01:35:05.870 --> 01:35:05.880 align:start position:0%
um piece of testimony anyone else in
 
01:35:08.209 --> 01:35:08.219 align:start position:0%
round two and it's got to be brave
 
01:35:10.310 --> 01:35:10.320 align:start position:0%
because you know the clock is sticking
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
01:35:14.810 --> 01:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and I will be as
 
01:35:17.030 --> 01:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
concise as humanly possible
 
01:35:18.770 --> 01:35:18.780 align:start position:0%
um we've talked a lot about
 
01:35:20.990 --> 01:35:21.000 align:start position:0%
a lot of the spill um but I just wanted
 
01:35:23.810 --> 01:35:23.820 align:start position:0%
to bring everyone's attention to
 
01:35:26.330 --> 01:35:26.340 align:start position:0%
um one small thing that is a not so
 
01:35:28.490 --> 01:35:28.500 align:start position:0%
small and is a pet peeve of mine
 
01:35:30.649 --> 01:35:30.659 align:start position:0%
um and that is when language isn't tight
 
01:35:34.010 --> 01:35:34.020 align:start position:0%
uh when it is vague or misleading and in
 
01:35:36.110 --> 01:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
this particular Bell on page one line
 
01:35:39.530 --> 01:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
seven and page one line 21.
 
01:35:42.430 --> 01:35:42.440 align:start position:0%
um we have some legal terms being used
 
01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:44.760 align:start position:0%
inappropriately it says while the minor
 
01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
child is in the custody of the school
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
district we know that kids are not in
 
01:35:50.030 --> 01:35:50.040 align:start position:0%
the custody of schools they're in the
 
01:35:52.250 --> 01:35:52.260 align:start position:0%
custody of their parents and parents
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
have to sign permission slips for
 
01:35:56.510 --> 01:35:56.520 align:start position:0%
schools to do anything we know that
 
01:35:58.970 --> 01:35:58.980 align:start position:0%
school districts do not act in loco
 
01:36:01.550 --> 01:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
parentis in loco parentis is a very
 
01:36:06.709 --> 01:36:06.719 align:start position:0%
specific legal term I can't if I'm
 
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
working at a school make a decision
 
01:36:11.030 --> 01:36:11.040 align:start position:0%
about medication I can't make a decision
 
01:36:13.669 --> 01:36:13.679 align:start position:0%
about who a child gets dismissed to I
 
01:36:15.770 --> 01:36:15.780 align:start position:0%
can't make any kinds of decisions about
 
01:36:18.050 --> 01:36:18.060 align:start position:0%
what parents have the right to make the
 
01:36:20.149 --> 01:36:20.159 align:start position:0%
decisions for if I want my child to be
 
01:36:21.950 --> 01:36:21.960 align:start position:0%
in the custody of someone else or
 
01:36:24.410 --> 01:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
someone else to act in local parentis I
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
actually have to either go to court or
 
01:36:29.090 --> 01:36:29.100 align:start position:0%
get a notarized statement giving that
 
01:36:30.830 --> 01:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
person the rights that's why parents
 
01:36:32.629 --> 01:36:32.639 align:start position:0%
have to be involved in things like IEP
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
meetings and other other meetings that
 
01:36:39.169 --> 01:36:39.179 align:start position:0%
the school has so it's really
 
01:36:42.310 --> 01:36:42.320 align:start position:0%
um irritating to me to start off a bill
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
utilizing terms that simply aren't
 
01:36:47.390 --> 01:36:47.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate or accurate
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
thank you representative representative
 
01:36:51.470 --> 01:36:51.480 align:start position:0%
ball round two
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:58.430 --> 01:36:58.440 align:start position:0%
respect I believe that you've misdated
 
01:37:00.649 --> 01:37:00.659 align:start position:0%
the schools do act in love espressos
 
01:37:02.330 --> 01:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
that's why we have nurses who can give
 
01:37:03.890 --> 01:37:03.900 align:start position:0%
out medications and take care of
 
01:37:05.510 --> 01:37:05.520 align:start position:0%
children and I have head school
 
01:37:07.370 --> 01:37:07.380 align:start position:0%
districts say that yes they are too
 
01:37:10.990 --> 01:37:11.000 align:start position:0%
working in Locust in Lotus breakfast
 
01:37:14.450 --> 01:37:14.460 align:start position:0%
that being said as a teacher in all my
 
01:37:15.770 --> 01:37:15.780 align:start position:0%
years in school I know that all the
 
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
teachers refer to the children as these
 
01:37:19.490 --> 01:37:19.500 align:start position:0%
are my students my students but the fact
 
01:37:20.810 --> 01:37:20.820 align:start position:0%
of the matter is they are not my
 
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
students they do not belong to me they
 
01:37:24.410 --> 01:37:24.420 align:start position:0%
belong to their parents and their
 
01:37:26.030 --> 01:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
parents are the ones who make the
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
decisions for them
 
01:37:30.830 --> 01:37:30.840 align:start position:0%
round two briefly representative Greg
 
01:37:33.709 --> 01:37:33.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so on the medicine
 
01:37:36.169 --> 01:37:36.179 align:start position:0%
thing even for Tylenol I've had three
 
01:37:37.729 --> 01:37:37.739 align:start position:0%
kids just recently we had to have
 
01:37:39.229 --> 01:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
permission slips from the parents for
 
01:37:41.510 --> 01:37:41.520 align:start position:0%
the even Tylenol or any kind of
 
01:37:43.310 --> 01:37:43.320 align:start position:0%
medication or they where I had to go to
 
01:37:45.410 --> 01:37:45.420 align:start position:0%
school to give it so um that's one
 
01:37:47.390 --> 01:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
problem the other thing is I've had
 
01:37:47.400 --> 01:37:48.410 align:start position:0%
problem the other thing is I've had
teachers

01:37:48.410 --> 01:37:48.420 align:start position:0%
teachers
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
um by the way when we had to tell what
 
01:37:54.290 --> 01:37:54.300 align:start position:0%
my kids had been through that broke down
 
01:37:56.330 --> 01:37:56.340 align:start position:0%
crying not because they were just their
 
01:37:58.669 --> 01:37:58.679 align:start position:0%
teachers because when I couldn't protect
 
01:38:00.590 --> 01:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
my kids and they were at school I knew
 
01:38:02.990 --> 01:38:03.000 align:start position:0%
their emotional well-being was there and
 
01:38:05.090 --> 01:38:05.100 align:start position:0%
they were very well attached to our kids
 
01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
and and might they couldn't
 
01:38:09.110 --> 01:38:09.120 align:start position:0%
even fathom how these three kids who are
 
01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
functioning so well were in these
 
01:38:14.290 --> 01:38:14.300 align:start position:0%
classes but I I've had them come to um
 
01:38:17.689 --> 01:38:17.699 align:start position:0%
different events for the kids because of
 
01:38:19.070 --> 01:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
this connection that they had and
 
01:38:20.629 --> 01:38:20.639 align:start position:0%
because my kids could trust them and
 
01:38:22.250 --> 01:38:22.260 align:start position:0%
talk to them about things they weren't
 
01:38:24.709 --> 01:38:24.719 align:start position:0%
quite even ready to trust me with just
 
01:38:24.719 --> 01:38:25.610 align:start position:0%
quite even ready to trust me with just
yet

01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:38:29.149 --> 01:38:29.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:31.729 --> 01:38:31.739 align:start position:0%
okay my turn
 
01:38:35.149 --> 01:38:35.159 align:start position:0%
in terms of parental rights in private
 
01:38:35.159 --> 01:38:37.970 align:start position:0%
in terms of parental rights in private
schools

01:38:37.970 --> 01:38:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:39.890 --> 01:38:39.900 align:start position:0%
the parents have the rights that you
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
contract with that school for
 
01:38:44.209 --> 01:38:44.219 align:start position:0%
early on in my life I was on the staff
 
01:38:45.950 --> 01:38:45.960 align:start position:0%
of Saint Timothy's Church in Baltimore
 
01:38:48.470 --> 01:38:48.480 align:start position:0%
Maryland we had a parochial school
 
01:38:51.290 --> 01:38:51.300 align:start position:0%
there was a contract if your kid goes to
 
01:38:54.770 --> 01:38:54.780 align:start position:0%
Saint Tims you have read the above
 
01:38:57.110 --> 01:38:57.120 align:start position:0%
you must do the following you may not do
 
01:38:59.629 --> 01:38:59.639 align:start position:0%
the following we'll talk about the rest
 
01:38:59.639 --> 01:39:00.590 align:start position:0%
the following we'll talk about the rest
Etc

01:39:00.590 --> 01:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
Etc
 
01:39:03.169 --> 01:39:03.179 align:start position:0%
once you signed it
 
01:39:06.169 --> 01:39:06.179 align:start position:0%
that's the limit or the extent of the
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
rights you have
 
01:39:10.370 --> 01:39:10.380 align:start position:0%
we had Parents read through it and say I
 
01:39:11.750 --> 01:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
don't want to sign it
 
01:39:14.629 --> 01:39:14.639 align:start position:0%
okay Saint Williams around the corner
 
01:39:16.250 --> 01:39:16.260 align:start position:0%
has a very nice school maybe they're
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
taking new students
 
01:39:18.360 --> 01:39:20.209 align:start position:0%
taking new students
secondly

01:39:20.209 --> 01:39:20.219 align:start position:0%
secondly
 
01:39:22.850 --> 01:39:22.860 align:start position:0%
I was highly annoyed by the phrase it
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
takes a village for a long time until I
 
01:39:27.770 --> 01:39:27.780 align:start position:0%
came to agree with it
 
01:39:30.890 --> 01:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
the question here is in the village
 
01:39:33.649 --> 01:39:33.659 align:start position:0%
who's the mayor
 
01:39:33.659 --> 01:39:36.169 align:start position:0%
who's the mayor
thirdly

01:39:36.169 --> 01:39:36.179 align:start position:0%
thirdly
 
01:39:39.649 --> 01:39:39.659 align:start position:0%
we talk about particular gender issues
 
01:39:41.090 --> 01:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
because that's the hot button issue
 
01:39:42.649 --> 01:39:42.659 align:start position:0%
right now it may be something else and
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
we'll need to broaden this should this
 
01:39:45.239 --> 01:39:46.790 align:start position:0%
we'll need to broaden this should this
pass

01:39:46.790 --> 01:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
pass
 
01:39:48.530 --> 01:39:48.540 align:start position:0%
I want to know
 
01:39:51.649 --> 01:39:51.659 align:start position:0%
if my child has been flirting
 
01:39:53.570 --> 01:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
with white supremacy
 
01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:55.199 align:start position:0%
I get a little bit of hints at home
 
01:39:57.050 --> 01:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
something that should have been locked
 
01:39:58.910 --> 01:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
away that I don't have a key to but got
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
left out I'm wondering what's he doing
 
01:40:03.890 --> 01:40:03.900 align:start position:0%
at school I have two ways I can ask
 
01:40:05.930 --> 01:40:05.940 align:start position:0%
there's probably a blabbermouth kid in
 
01:40:07.310 --> 01:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
the neighborhood that I've built up a
 
01:40:09.110 --> 01:40:09.120 align:start position:0%
good relationship with and I might want
 
01:40:10.669 --> 01:40:10.679 align:start position:0%
to ask that kid
 
01:40:14.330 --> 01:40:14.340 align:start position:0%
I much would rather ask his kids my
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
child's teacher
 
01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:18.659 align:start position:0%
and have an honest answer
 
01:40:21.169 --> 01:40:21.179 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't just cut to the political
 
01:40:24.830 --> 01:40:24.840 align:start position:0%
or ideological left it could cut in many
 
01:40:26.990 --> 01:40:27.000 align:start position:0%
places to the political ideological
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
right as well
 
01:40:33.169 --> 01:40:33.179 align:start position:0%
now in terms of abusive parents
 
01:40:36.410 --> 01:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
some parents have abused their kids
 
01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:39.780 align:start position:0%
before issues of gender come up
 
01:40:43.729 --> 01:40:43.739 align:start position:0%
I rather wonder if the relationship with
 
01:40:46.550 --> 01:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
the kid and the parents and we've
 
01:40:48.010 --> 01:40:48.020 align:start position:0%
already said
 
01:40:49.970 --> 01:40:49.980 align:start position:0%
there are some pretty rough
 
01:40:52.310 --> 01:40:52.320 align:start position:0%
relationships I have a feeling it's
 
01:40:55.189 --> 01:40:55.199 align:start position:0%
probably gotten to the reportable stage
 
01:40:58.370 --> 01:40:58.380 align:start position:0%
already in some cases
 
01:41:03.350 --> 01:41:03.360 align:start position:0%
also if or maybe we should say when a
 
01:41:05.649 --> 01:41:05.659 align:start position:0%
parent learns about
 
01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:07.550 align:start position:0%
parent learns about
wxy

01:41:07.550 --> 01:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
wxy
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
from the blabbermouth kid
 
01:41:12.530 --> 01:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
from the kid who said something to his
 
01:41:14.629 --> 01:41:14.639 align:start position:0%
or her parents
 
01:41:17.570 --> 01:41:17.580 align:start position:0%
and a very sincere whether misguided or
 
01:41:20.990 --> 01:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
not is arguable but a sincere parent
 
01:41:23.330 --> 01:41:23.340 align:start position:0%
says to the
 
01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
transgender child
 
01:41:27.470 --> 01:41:27.480 align:start position:0%
do you know what my daughter said is
 
01:41:28.910 --> 01:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
that true
 
01:41:32.570 --> 01:41:32.580 align:start position:0%
or worse in the mouth of a mean parent
 
01:41:35.090 --> 01:41:35.100 align:start position:0%
is just waiting to rub that family down
 
01:41:38.450 --> 01:41:38.460 align:start position:0%
the road's nose in it aha I know what I
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
know and the parents didn't learn it
 
01:41:42.950 --> 01:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
from the teacher the parents didn't
 
01:41:44.330 --> 01:41:44.340 align:start position:0%
learn it from the child the parent
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
learned it in the neighborhood on the
 
01:41:46.080 --> 01:41:47.570 align:start position:0%
learned it in the neighborhood on the
straight

01:41:47.570 --> 01:41:47.580 align:start position:0%
straight
 
01:41:50.030 --> 01:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think the parents might be more Angry
 
01:41:52.910 --> 01:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
not less because they were embarrassed
 
01:41:54.729 --> 01:41:54.739 align:start position:0%
when they were told
 
01:41:59.810 --> 01:41:59.820 align:start position:0%
also might the parents now wonder
 
01:42:02.629 --> 01:42:02.639 align:start position:0%
can we trust the teachers
 
01:42:04.430 --> 01:42:04.440 align:start position:0%
are they the mayor in the village in
 
01:42:06.229 --> 01:42:06.239 align:start position:0%
their mind
 
01:42:08.689 --> 01:42:08.699 align:start position:0%
I just want to point out numbers of
 
01:42:11.090 --> 01:42:11.100 align:start position:0%
people surprising numbers of people took
 
01:42:14.689 --> 01:42:14.699 align:start position:0%
advantage of educational accounts way
 
01:42:16.310 --> 01:42:16.320 align:start position:0%
more than what we thought we all know
 
01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.770 align:start position:0%
more than what we thought we all know
that

01:42:18.770 --> 01:42:18.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
if teachers don't tell
 
01:42:26.149 --> 01:42:26.159 align:start position:0%
when asked and notice that it's not a
 
01:42:29.450 --> 01:42:29.460 align:start position:0%
mandate mandatory reportable thing
 
01:42:33.350 --> 01:42:33.360 align:start position:0%
it is if asked tell truth
 
01:42:38.930 --> 01:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
if parents find out this is happening
 
01:42:40.910 --> 01:42:40.920 align:start position:0%
I wonder how many more people will want
 
01:42:42.290 --> 01:42:42.300 align:start position:0%
to pull their kids out of the public
 
01:42:42.300 --> 01:42:44.090 align:start position:0%
to pull their kids out of the public
schools

01:42:44.090 --> 01:42:44.100 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:42:46.850 --> 01:42:46.860 align:start position:0%
a couple more points
 
01:42:49.010 --> 01:42:49.020 align:start position:0%
I forget the movie title but there was
 
01:42:51.709 --> 01:42:51.719 align:start position:0%
one maybe you saw it whether it was a
 
01:42:54.350 --> 01:42:54.360 align:start position:0%
testing which predicts
 
01:42:56.510 --> 01:42:56.520 align:start position:0%
who will commit a crime
 
01:42:58.790 --> 01:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
person hasn't committed a crime yet
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
but that person tested as likely to
 
01:43:06.470 --> 01:43:06.480 align:start position:0%
and the government came in on it
 
01:43:06.480 --> 01:43:09.530 align:start position:0%
and the government came in on it
so

01:43:09.530 --> 01:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:12.530 --> 01:43:12.540 align:start position:0%
the parents are possibly statistically
 
01:43:15.530 --> 01:43:15.540 align:start position:0%
going to beat the child
 
01:43:18.830 --> 01:43:18.840 align:start position:0%
you've already convicted them of a crime
 
01:43:20.689 --> 01:43:20.699 align:start position:0%
and then finally
 
01:43:24.530 --> 01:43:24.540 align:start position:0%
there were 21 school districts that have
 
01:43:27.129 --> 01:43:27.139 align:start position:0%
a transgender
 
01:43:30.350 --> 01:43:30.360 align:start position:0%
non-conforming policy I kept it in my
 
01:43:33.290 --> 01:43:33.300 align:start position:0%
phone so I can quote it exactly it reads
 
01:43:34.850 --> 01:43:34.860 align:start position:0%
like this 21 New Hampshire school
 
01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:37.520 align:start position:0%
districts that have transgender gender
 
01:43:40.370 --> 01:43:40.380 align:start position:0%
non-conforming policies 21 school
 
01:43:42.770 --> 01:43:42.780 align:start position:0%
districts that openly State you can get
 
01:43:42.780 --> 01:43:43.490 align:start position:0%
districts that openly State you can get
it

01:43:43.490 --> 01:43:43.500 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
that District Personnel can or should
 
01:43:47.870 --> 01:43:47.880 align:start position:0%
keep a student's transgender status
 
01:43:51.109 --> 01:43:51.119 align:start position:0%
hidden from the parents 21 school
 
01:43:54.129 --> 01:43:54.139 align:start position:0%
districts already say that so
 
01:43:57.709 --> 01:43:57.719 align:start position:0%
that's my weighing in
 
01:43:57.719 --> 01:43:58.629 align:start position:0%
that's my weighing in
um

01:43:58.629 --> 01:43:58.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:02.030 --> 01:44:02.040 align:start position:0%
representative Perez Mr chairman
 
01:44:05.149 --> 01:44:05.159 align:start position:0%
um I just want to add that something
 
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
that bothers me is you mentioned and did
 
01:44:10.609 --> 01:44:10.619 align:start position:0%
a lot of parents now they send the kids
 
01:44:12.590 --> 01:44:12.600 align:start position:0%
to private school because they don't
 
01:44:12.600 --> 01:44:13.550 align:start position:0%
to private school because they don't
feel

01:44:13.550 --> 01:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
feel
 
01:44:16.250 --> 01:44:16.260 align:start position:0%
heard in the school systems and you know
 
01:44:19.070 --> 01:44:19.080 align:start position:0%
a lot of these kids you know a lot of
 
01:44:21.830 --> 01:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
these parents they're taking advantage
 
01:44:26.030 --> 01:44:26.040 align:start position:0%
that bothers me because when
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
I asked to the report for the report how
 
01:44:32.750 --> 01:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
many children burn underrepresented
 
01:44:34.669 --> 01:44:34.679 align:start position:0%
communities they've really taken
 
01:44:36.709 --> 01:44:36.719 align:start position:0%
advantage of that really getting the
 
01:44:39.050 --> 01:44:39.060 align:start position:0%
money to go in private school
 
01:44:41.390 --> 01:44:41.400 align:start position:0%
I asked for the report and they they
 
01:44:43.430 --> 01:44:43.440 align:start position:0%
would told me that that report was going
 
01:44:46.370 --> 01:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
to send to me never got sent to me so it
 
01:44:49.910 --> 01:44:49.920 align:start position:0%
bothers me to hear the more parents I
 
01:44:51.709 --> 01:44:51.719 align:start position:0%
want to know where parents this is the
 
01:44:53.510 --> 01:44:53.520 align:start position:0%
parents already have kids in private
 
01:44:55.550 --> 01:44:55.560 align:start position:0%
schools and now they're taking advantage
 
01:44:56.990 --> 01:44:57.000 align:start position:0%
and taking my money from the public
 
01:45:00.290 --> 01:45:00.300 align:start position:0%
schools and taking away the money for
 
01:45:02.709 --> 01:45:02.719 align:start position:0%
programs they've been helping
 
01:45:05.030 --> 01:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
underrepresented communities and we're
 
01:45:07.250 --> 01:45:07.260 align:start position:0%
taking away the money and then we feel
 
01:45:09.590 --> 01:45:09.600 align:start position:0%
so proud the parents now more parents
 
01:45:11.570 --> 01:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
are going to be able to to take the kids
 
01:45:13.970 --> 01:45:13.980 align:start position:0%
away from the public school but when we
 
01:45:16.370 --> 01:45:16.380 align:start position:0%
asked for the report how many children
 
01:45:17.770 --> 01:45:17.780 align:start position:0%
how many new children for
 
01:45:20.090 --> 01:45:20.100 align:start position:0%
underrepresented communities taking
 
01:45:22.669 --> 01:45:22.679 align:start position:0%
advantage of this program no one has
 
01:45:25.070 --> 01:45:25.080 align:start position:0%
that the report no matter Perez I'm
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
going to rule this non-germaine it's an
 
01:45:28.910 --> 01:45:28.920 align:start position:0%
important subject but it is not this
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
bill why are you mentioning so that's
 
01:45:32.450 --> 01:45:32.460 align:start position:0%
why I mentioned it as well because if we
 
01:45:34.310 --> 01:45:34.320 align:start position:0%
want to be honest we have to be honest
 
01:45:36.550 --> 01:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
and you are now uh finished
 
01:45:39.649 --> 01:45:39.659 align:start position:0%
representative disamoni thank you Mr
 
01:45:42.229 --> 01:45:42.239 align:start position:0%
chair we've heard a lot about people's
 
01:45:46.810 --> 01:45:46.820 align:start position:0%
opinions on WX and Y
 
01:45:49.609 --> 01:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
we're assuming
 
01:45:53.470 --> 01:45:53.480 align:start position:0%
um in some of those opinions that
 
01:45:55.790 --> 01:45:55.800 align:start position:0%
these uh three sections are not
 
01:45:58.310 --> 01:45:58.320 align:start position:0%
important because the child could be
 
01:45:58.320 --> 01:45:59.270 align:start position:0%
important because the child could be
harmed

01:45:59.270 --> 01:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
harmed
 
01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:08.450 --> 01:46:08.460 align:start position:0%
this gives the parents an opportunity to
 
01:46:12.109 --> 01:46:12.119 align:start position:0%
help that child earlier
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
sooner rather than later
 
01:46:17.810 --> 01:46:17.820 align:start position:0%
if my child is choosing to be called a
 
01:46:19.430 --> 01:46:19.440 align:start position:0%
different name
 
01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
that doesn't necessarily mean that it's
 
01:46:24.590 --> 01:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
a bad thing but I want to counsel my
 
01:46:26.270 --> 01:46:26.280 align:start position:0%
child and say hey
 
01:46:28.669 --> 01:46:28.679 align:start position:0%
you don't like your name
 
01:46:32.750 --> 01:46:32.760 align:start position:0%
um okay I personally always hated my
 
01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:33.770 align:start position:0%
um okay I personally always hated my
name

01:46:33.770 --> 01:46:33.780 align:start position:0%
name
 
01:46:36.229 --> 01:46:36.239 align:start position:0%
and I was always called by a nickname
 
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
that I chose in school
 
01:46:41.689 --> 01:46:41.699 align:start position:0%
so it could be something very innocent
 
01:46:44.209 --> 01:46:44.219 align:start position:0%
as yeah I I don't like the name you gave
 
01:46:44.219 --> 01:46:45.050 align:start position:0%
as yeah I I don't like the name you gave
me

01:46:45.050 --> 01:46:45.060 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:46:47.209 --> 01:46:47.219 align:start position:0%
kids don't have a choice in the name
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
they're given
 
01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
The Second One X
 
01:46:55.370 --> 01:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
if a child is being identified by any uh
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
gender identity pronouns
 
01:47:04.450 --> 01:47:04.460 align:start position:0%
most parents are good loving caring
 
01:47:06.709 --> 01:47:06.719 align:start position:0%
nurturing parents
 
01:47:09.470 --> 01:47:09.480 align:start position:0%
and if their child
 
01:47:13.609 --> 01:47:13.619 align:start position:0%
is very confused which most kids when
 
01:47:17.570 --> 01:47:17.580 align:start position:0%
they hit the puberty stage are
 
01:47:20.570 --> 01:47:20.580 align:start position:0%
but these kids are now
 
01:47:22.729 --> 01:47:22.739 align:start position:0%
defining themselves as a different
 
01:47:22.739 --> 01:47:24.830 align:start position:0%
defining themselves as a different
gender

01:47:24.830 --> 01:47:24.840 align:start position:0%
gender
 
01:47:29.450 --> 01:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
I believe that it is the responsibility
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:36.050 --> 01:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
to help that child
 
01:47:39.290 --> 01:47:39.300 align:start position:0%
be able to sit with the parent and let
 
01:47:43.010 --> 01:47:43.020 align:start position:0%
that parent help that child with whether
 
01:47:46.250 --> 01:47:46.260 align:start position:0%
it be outside of the school
 
01:47:48.890 --> 01:47:48.900 align:start position:0%
which in most places would most
 
01:47:51.649 --> 01:47:51.659 align:start position:0%
instances would be help that child get
 
01:47:53.689 --> 01:47:53.699 align:start position:0%
involved in counseling to help that
 
01:47:56.450 --> 01:47:56.460 align:start position:0%
child through that difficult time and
 
01:47:58.450 --> 01:47:58.460 align:start position:0%
help that child to understand
 
01:48:02.209 --> 01:48:02.219 align:start position:0%
that the parents loved them enough to
 
01:48:04.189 --> 01:48:04.199 align:start position:0%
say okay
 
01:48:06.229 --> 01:48:06.239 align:start position:0%
if this is what you do and let's get
 
01:48:08.810 --> 01:48:08.820 align:start position:0%
counseling and help us both understand
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
what it is that you're going through a
 
01:48:13.910 --> 01:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
heterosexual parent is not going to
 
01:48:16.910 --> 01:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
understand what a transgender kid is
 
01:48:18.970 --> 01:48:18.980 align:start position:0%
going through and it's their
 
01:48:23.570 --> 01:48:23.580 align:start position:0%
responsibility to help that child
 
01:48:27.649 --> 01:48:27.659 align:start position:0%
and if we don't give them the
 
01:48:30.169 --> 01:48:30.179 align:start position:0%
opportunity soon enough it will harm the
 
01:48:30.179 --> 01:48:32.350 align:start position:0%
opportunity soon enough it will harm the
child

01:48:32.350 --> 01:48:32.360 align:start position:0%
child
 
01:48:34.790 --> 01:48:34.800 align:start position:0%

01:48:46.970 --> 01:48:46.980 align:start position:0%

that's eight eight that eight eight was
 
01:54:40.790 --> 01:54:40.800 align:start position:0%
on OTP we now have to do itl on the

original bill
 
01:54:46.609 --> 01:54:46.619 align:start position:0%

01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
that was mostly for me
 
01:55:26.930 --> 01:55:26.940 align:start position:0%

done parliamentary and query
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
can can this be sent to the floor as no
 
01:56:38.280 --> 01:56:40.629 align:start position:0%
can can this be sent to the floor as no
recommendation

01:56:40.629 --> 01:56:40.639 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
that's the way we're going to do it
 
01:56:45.410 --> 01:56:45.420 align:start position:0%
correct I believe so thank you sir
 
01:56:48.169 --> 01:56:48.179 align:start position:0%
there's nothing one everything tied okay
 
01:56:51.770 --> 01:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
this ends the um we just did the exact
 
01:56:55.129 --> 01:56:55.139 align:start position:0%
session on House Bill 10.
 
01:56:58.010 --> 01:56:58.020 align:start position:0%
uh and now
 
01:57:00.609 --> 01:57:00.619 align:start position:0%
um let me look out there
 
01:57:06.050 --> 01:57:06.060 align:start position:0%
the next thing that is up is going to be
 
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
I opened the exec session on HR house
 
01:57:16.970 --> 01:57:16.980 align:start position:0%
resolution 14 there is an amendment that
 
01:57:20.390 --> 01:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
I believe took into account
 
01:57:24.109 --> 01:57:24.119 align:start position:0%
numbers of things that we said in the
 
01:57:26.589 --> 01:57:26.599 align:start position:0%
hearing so the chair recognizes
 
01:57:29.209 --> 01:57:29.219 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi the author of
 
01:57:32.030 --> 01:57:32.040 align:start position:0%
the amendment in the original Bill not
 
01:57:35.689 --> 01:57:35.699 align:start position:0%
for another hearing but simply to
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
explain what the
 
01:57:41.890 --> 01:57:41.900 align:start position:0%
um amendment number
 
01:57:52.430 --> 01:57:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:54.649 --> 01:57:54.659 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair JD Bernardi
 
01:57:57.250 --> 01:57:57.260 align:start position:0%
Rockingham 36.
 
01:58:02.930 --> 01:58:02.940 align:start position:0%
so uh what this bill did was uh take
 
01:58:06.890 --> 01:58:06.900 align:start position:0%
into consideration uh the comments from
 
01:58:11.330 --> 01:58:11.340 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn and attorney head in
 
01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:12.189 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn and attorney head in
uh

01:58:12.189 --> 01:58:12.199 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:58:16.070 --> 01:58:16.080 align:start position:0%
making improvements to the legislation
 
01:58:16.080 --> 01:58:16.729 align:start position:0%
making improvements to the legislation
um

01:58:16.729 --> 01:58:16.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:20.810 --> 01:58:20.820 align:start position:0%
the primary paragraph there indicates uh
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
well first that the the initial bill had
 
01:58:28.250 --> 01:58:28.260 align:start position:0%
a choice for this committee to either as
 
01:58:32.229 --> 01:58:32.239 align:start position:0%
a committee of the whole be the be the
 
01:58:36.649 --> 01:58:36.659 align:start position:0%
uh committee to address this issue or an
 
01:58:38.390 --> 01:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
appointed committee
 
01:58:40.910 --> 01:58:40.920 align:start position:0%
um the discussion had been that an
 
01:58:42.890 --> 01:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
appointed committee was was more
 
01:58:42.900 --> 01:58:44.149 align:start position:0%
appointed committee was was more
appropriate

01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:58:47.510 --> 01:58:47.520 align:start position:0%
um so 11 state legislators and five
 
01:58:49.970 --> 01:58:49.980 align:start position:0%
members of the public
 
01:58:49.980 --> 01:58:51.169 align:start position:0%
members of the public
um

01:58:51.169 --> 01:58:51.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:53.270 --> 01:58:53.280 align:start position:0%
and the second point is the most
 
01:58:56.390 --> 01:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
important concern was to get the issues
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
that are continually in front of this
 
01:59:03.470 --> 01:59:03.480 align:start position:0%
committee heard to gather evidence from
 
01:59:08.149 --> 01:59:08.159 align:start position:0%
the the members of the public that have
 
01:59:15.050 --> 01:59:15.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:17.689 --> 01:59:17.699 align:start position:0%
or want the better word victims of the
 
01:59:21.169 --> 01:59:21.179 align:start position:0%
system to get their testimony
 
01:59:25.070 --> 01:59:25.080 align:start position:0%
and then that be followed up by the
 
01:59:27.890 --> 01:59:27.900 align:start position:0%
committee's ability to ask
 
01:59:32.810 --> 01:59:32.820 align:start position:0%
uh the the response on the various
 
01:59:35.209 --> 01:59:35.219 align:start position:0%
issues and problem areas from the
 
01:59:38.270 --> 01:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
guardian Idol items from uh children and
 
01:59:40.430 --> 01:59:40.440 align:start position:0%
family law from the Bureau of Child
 
01:59:43.870 --> 01:59:43.880 align:start position:0%
Support Services and from the Judiciary
 
01:59:48.609 --> 01:59:48.619 align:start position:0%
and specifically with respect to
 
01:59:51.350 --> 01:59:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative Lynn's comment
 
01:59:55.010 --> 01:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
um that the testimony from the Judiciary
 
01:59:58.189 --> 01:59:58.199 align:start position:0%
shall not cause the judge to violate the
 
02:00:01.129 --> 02:00:01.139 align:start position:0%
rules of conduct or otherwise reveal
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
analysis of specific cases so
 
02:00:08.209 --> 02:00:08.219 align:start position:0%
their analysis cannot be questioned but
 
02:00:12.109 --> 02:00:12.119 align:start position:0%
the facts can be laid on the table and
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
the the
 
02:00:15.169 --> 02:00:15.179 align:start position:0%
um the facts and the circumstances of
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
the case cannot be
 
02:00:22.550 --> 02:00:22.560 align:start position:0%
declared inappropriate for review
 
02:00:25.790 --> 02:00:25.800 align:start position:0%
thirdly and again I thank representative
 
02:00:29.930 --> 02:00:29.940 align:start position:0%
Lynn uh for for this uh recommendation
 
02:00:33.470 --> 02:00:33.480 align:start position:0%
that the committee can seek guidance
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
from from other organizations that may
 
02:00:40.010 --> 02:00:40.020 align:start position:0%
have expertise in this area that being
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
the the bar association uh New Hampshire
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
legal assistance and the
 
02:00:51.830 --> 02:00:51.840 align:start position:0%
a couple of uh Family Court oriented
 
02:00:53.870 --> 02:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
organizations the national Center for
 
02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
state courts or the National Council of
 
02:01:01.010 --> 02:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
so those are organizations that that can
 
02:01:08.050 --> 02:01:08.060 align:start position:0%
offer guidance on how
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
issues that this committee has dealt
 
02:01:13.850 --> 02:01:13.860 align:start position:0%
with have been have been addressed in
 
02:01:16.070 --> 02:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
other states or other areas and may be
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
very relevant to uh committees
 
02:01:19.320 --> 02:01:22.430 align:start position:0%
very relevant to uh committees
investigation

02:01:22.430 --> 02:01:22.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:26.149 --> 02:01:26.159 align:start position:0%
the uh the remainder of the bill is
 
02:01:28.609 --> 02:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
largely the tail end of what had been
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
there before is that there would be at
 
02:01:33.709 --> 02:01:33.719 align:start position:0%
least three public hearings
 
02:01:35.689 --> 02:01:35.699 align:start position:0%
um that would take place so probably
 
02:01:40.850 --> 02:01:40.860 align:start position:0%
would be more because the the date of
 
02:01:43.370 --> 02:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
coming up with the final report has been
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
extended to uh the end of December of
 
02:01:52.250 --> 02:01:52.260 align:start position:0%
2024 not 2023 as the original bill as
 
02:01:55.550 --> 02:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
stated to allow the committee to do a
 
02:01:59.089 --> 02:01:59.099 align:start position:0%
thorough investigation and and ask all
 
02:02:01.970 --> 02:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
the questions it needs to make a
 
02:02:04.189 --> 02:02:04.199 align:start position:0%
positive recommendation on several of
 
02:02:07.250 --> 02:02:07.260 align:start position:0%
the areas that you've been dealing with
 
02:02:10.270 --> 02:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
um and have the time and the resources
 
02:02:14.629 --> 02:02:14.639 align:start position:0%
to conduct that investigation and make
 
02:02:19.370 --> 02:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:21.709 --> 02:02:21.719 align:start position:0%
any questions on the amendment
 
02:02:24.229 --> 02:02:24.239 align:start position:0%
specifically not to rehear the bill but
 
02:02:27.010 --> 02:02:27.020 align:start position:0%
to ask any clarifying questions
 
02:02:30.830 --> 02:02:30.840 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you briefly
 
02:02:32.870 --> 02:02:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I know that this was
 
02:02:35.089 --> 02:02:35.099 align:start position:0%
um already gone has already gone through
 
02:02:38.089 --> 02:02:38.099 align:start position:0%
of OLS
 
02:02:40.370 --> 02:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
um but there's a lot of grammar
 
02:02:40.380 --> 02:02:41.930 align:start position:0%
um but there's a lot of grammar
capitalization

02:02:41.930 --> 02:02:41.940 align:start position:0%
capitalization
 
02:02:43.910 --> 02:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
Etc does that get fixed between now and
 
02:02:45.649 --> 02:02:45.659 align:start position:0%
when it goes to the floor
 
02:02:47.629 --> 02:02:47.639 align:start position:0%
like do I have to point out any of that
 
02:02:50.209 --> 02:02:50.219 align:start position:0%
no no okay that was it thank you good
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:02:51.599 --> 02:02:52.609 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

02:02:52.609 --> 02:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:55.070 --> 02:02:55.080 align:start position:0%
just to say to everybody in
 
02:02:56.750 --> 02:02:56.760 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi who's part of
 
02:02:56.760 --> 02:02:58.189 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi who's part of
everybody

02:02:58.189 --> 02:02:58.199 align:start position:0%
everybody
 
02:03:00.709 --> 02:03:00.719 align:start position:0%
um I've got a trail of how this bill
 
02:03:04.550 --> 02:03:04.560 align:start position:0%
looked from the start and wow it's
 
02:03:06.050 --> 02:03:06.060 align:start position:0%
getting so much better there were
 
02:03:09.050 --> 02:03:09.060 align:start position:0%
breaches of house rules in the original
 
02:03:13.129 --> 02:03:13.139 align:start position:0%
draft there were I thought
 
02:03:15.290 --> 02:03:15.300 align:start position:0%
um the language could be rounded a
 
02:03:18.589 --> 02:03:18.599 align:start position:0%
little bit softened and it has been
 
02:03:22.250 --> 02:03:22.260 align:start position:0%
um I think what has come here
 
02:03:25.129 --> 02:03:25.139 align:start position:0%
um will be a good parallel track and let
 
02:03:26.930 --> 02:03:26.940 align:start position:0%
me explain
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I think you know that I've met with
 
02:03:31.310 --> 02:03:31.320 align:start position:0%
the current Chief Justice of the Supreme
 
02:03:34.070 --> 02:03:34.080 align:start position:0%
Court the retired chief justice which is
 
02:03:36.229 --> 02:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
representative chairman Lynn
 
02:03:36.239 --> 02:03:37.370 align:start position:0%
representative chairman Lynn
um

02:03:37.370 --> 02:03:37.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:03:41.390 --> 02:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
rep Judge David King who's the
 
02:03:44.570 --> 02:03:44.580 align:start position:0%
administrative justice of um Circuit
 
02:03:47.270 --> 02:03:47.280 align:start position:0%
Court which includes Family Court our
 
02:03:51.770 --> 02:03:51.780 align:start position:0%
own uh rep attorney had to say we need
 
02:03:55.010 --> 02:03:55.020 align:start position:0%
some continuing education for us for the
 
02:03:58.790 --> 02:03:58.800 align:start position:0%
public a lot of people are angry because
 
02:04:01.550 --> 02:04:01.560 align:start position:0%
they think something wrong is being done
 
02:04:04.189 --> 02:04:04.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes it isn't wrong right they just
 
02:04:06.950 --> 02:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
don't know why it's being done
 
02:04:10.910 --> 02:04:10.920 align:start position:0%
um most of the law shows I see on TV are
 
02:04:13.430 --> 02:04:13.440 align:start position:0%
criminal law it's different from circuit
 
02:04:15.470 --> 02:04:15.480 align:start position:0%
court and Night Court isn't a good
 
02:04:15.480 --> 02:04:18.410 align:start position:0%
court and Night Court isn't a good
example

02:04:18.410 --> 02:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:21.649 --> 02:04:21.659 align:start position:0%
um so as a result there needs to be that
 
02:04:24.410 --> 02:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
ongoing educational process for us for
 
02:04:26.390 --> 02:04:26.400 align:start position:0%
the wider population we're getting it
 
02:04:28.729 --> 02:04:28.739 align:start position:0%
going we have that continuing education
 
02:04:31.669 --> 02:04:31.679 align:start position:0%
meeting the last Tuesday afternoon of
 
02:04:33.530 --> 02:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
the month y'all invited as many gay
 
02:04:34.729 --> 02:04:34.739 align:start position:0%
would say
 
02:04:34.739 --> 02:04:35.390 align:start position:0%
would say
um

02:04:35.390 --> 02:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:04:39.410 --> 02:04:39.420 align:start position:0%
but having a couple of bills like this
 
02:04:42.530 --> 02:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
runs a parallel track especially for
 
02:04:45.229 --> 02:04:45.239 align:start position:0%
legislators so
 
02:04:47.270 --> 02:04:47.280 align:start position:0%
um that really wasn't a question that
 
02:04:49.970 --> 02:04:49.980 align:start position:0%
was kind of an executive statement but
 
02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
while you're up I thought appreciate it
 
02:04:53.810 --> 02:04:53.820 align:start position:0%
I'd say that
 
02:04:58.070 --> 02:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
thank you any other any questions for uh
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
representative Bernardi if not we're in
 
02:05:03.649 --> 02:05:03.659 align:start position:0%
the exact session so anybody wish to
 
02:05:11.750 --> 02:05:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:16.250 --> 02:05:16.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:19.370 --> 02:05:19.380 align:start position:0%
I I think it's a lot better uh it's an
 
02:05:20.990 --> 02:05:21.000 align:start position:0%
issue that needs to be looked at I agree
 
02:05:22.129 --> 02:05:22.139 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:05:24.530 --> 02:05:24.540 align:start position:0%
I mean at the five knowledgeable members
 
02:05:25.609 --> 02:05:25.619 align:start position:0%
of the public
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
uh the fact that they don't have a
 
02:05:29.270 --> 02:05:29.280 align:start position:0%
voting a vote
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know who we're gonna
 
02:05:33.709 --> 02:05:33.719 align:start position:0%
I don't know what five knowledgeable
 
02:05:35.209 --> 02:05:35.219 align:start position:0%
members are going to want to sit on a
 
02:05:37.669 --> 02:05:37.679 align:start position:0%
committee knowing they just have input
 
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
and no no vote
 
02:05:42.890 --> 02:05:42.900 align:start position:0%
um but I I mean I could oversee that
 
02:05:45.290 --> 02:05:45.300 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can get the five
 
02:05:45.300 --> 02:05:47.030 align:start position:0%
hopefully we can get the five
um

02:05:47.030 --> 02:05:47.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:51.830 --> 02:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:53.689 --> 02:05:53.699 align:start position:0%
there are new rules of the road for
 
02:05:55.910 --> 02:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
committees as you may know
 
02:05:55.920 --> 02:05:56.510 align:start position:0%
committees as you may know
um

02:05:56.510 --> 02:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:05:56.520 --> 02:05:58.669 align:start position:0%
um
uh

02:05:58.669 --> 02:05:58.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:06:00.770 --> 02:06:00.780 align:start position:0%
and I think this is trying to take that
 
02:06:04.370 --> 02:06:04.380 align:start position:0%
into account okay but anyone else anyone
 
02:06:04.380 --> 02:06:05.089 align:start position:0%

02:10:03.530 --> 02:10:03.540 align:start position:0%
we got three fish
 
02:10:10.430 --> 02:10:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:12.229 --> 02:10:12.239 align:start position:0%
yeah my that's what's going through my
 
02:10:13.550 --> 02:10:13.560 align:start position:0%
mind too is that I don't think house
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
resolutions can go on consent
 
02:10:18.070 --> 02:10:18.080 align:start position:0%
so we all have an objection to consent
 
02:10:20.810 --> 02:10:20.820 align:start position:0%
it does we do it goes on regular
 
02:10:23.450 --> 02:10:23.460 align:start position:0%

around Amendment 771 to this which I
 
02:11:34.550 --> 02:11:34.560 align:start position:0%
believe will help the purpose of the
 
02:11:36.790 --> 02:11:36.800 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
02:11:39.830 --> 02:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
in such ways that
 
02:11:43.070 --> 02:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
the judicial system will see this is a
 
02:11:46.430 --> 02:11:46.440 align:start position:0%
good thing and uh I think everybody can
 
02:11:56.629 --> 02:11:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:59.450 --> 02:11:59.460 align:start position:0%

02:12:06.229 --> 02:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
not a big deal but I would like to ask a
 
02:12:09.410 --> 02:12:09.420 align:start position:0%
question in in
 
02:12:13.550 --> 02:12:13.560 align:start position:0%
um when we have people sitting in um
 
02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
to testify
 
02:12:18.589 --> 02:12:18.599 align:start position:0%

02:12:19.669 --> 02:12:19.679 align:start position:0%
the public
 
02:12:22.490 --> 02:12:22.500 align:start position:0%
how does the procedure for someone who
 
02:12:24.709 --> 02:12:24.719 align:start position:0%
has a pink car that's supposed to give
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
it to the person at the end of the not
 
02:12:31.669 --> 02:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
going around to to give that to the to
 
02:12:33.530 --> 02:12:33.540 align:start position:0%
the chair I just have a question about
 
02:12:35.330 --> 02:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
that that is correct thank you for that
 
02:12:37.129 --> 02:12:37.139 align:start position:0%
observation the chair should have said
 
02:12:38.629 --> 02:12:38.639 align:start position:0%
something and didn't so thank you so
 
02:12:38.639 --> 02:12:40.370 align:start position:0%
something and didn't so thank you so
much

02:12:40.370 --> 02:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
much
 
02:12:42.290 --> 02:12:42.300 align:start position:0%
it's easy to forget I caught myself
 
02:12:44.030 --> 02:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the way in my old
 
02:12:45.649 --> 02:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
committee going to the front because I
 
02:12:48.890 --> 02:12:48.900 align:start position:0%
used to live there and and someone said
 
02:12:52.189 --> 02:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
you gotta go so yeah I I have violated
 
02:12:55.010 --> 02:12:55.020 align:start position:0%
that one so thank you all right
 
02:12:58.609 --> 02:12:58.619 align:start position:0%
Amendment zero seven seven one the
 
02:13:00.530 --> 02:13:00.540 align:start position:0%
amendment writer will speak to his
 
02:13:03.050 --> 02:13:03.060 align:start position:0%
Amendment he actually did just a minute
 
02:13:08.510 --> 02:13:08.520 align:start position:0%
ago and basically this encourages
 
02:13:12.709 --> 02:13:12.719 align:start position:0%
um a support person to sit with
 
02:13:16.330 --> 02:13:16.340 align:start position:0%
but remember there were concerns
 
02:13:21.050 --> 02:13:21.060 align:start position:0%
uh that the support person may overreach
 
02:13:24.109 --> 02:13:24.119 align:start position:0%
the role of being a support person and
 
02:13:25.729 --> 02:13:25.739 align:start position:0%
kind to signal
 
02:13:27.950 --> 02:13:27.960 align:start position:0%
things of course you can do that from
 
02:13:31.370 --> 02:13:31.380 align:start position:0%
you know sitting behind the the rail as
 
02:13:35.330 --> 02:13:35.340 align:start position:0%
well but sitting right up front there
 
02:13:39.069 --> 02:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:43.069 --> 02:13:43.079 align:start position:0%
interrupting of judicial procedure so we
 
02:13:45.290 --> 02:13:45.300 align:start position:0%
we wanted to try to find that sweet spot
 
02:13:45.300 --> 02:13:46.790 align:start position:0%
we wanted to try to find that sweet spot
where

02:13:46.790 --> 02:13:46.800 align:start position:0%
where
 
02:13:50.569 --> 02:13:50.579 align:start position:0%
um the genuine objections of the judges
 
02:13:52.609 --> 02:13:52.619 align:start position:0%
were heard but
 
02:13:56.030 --> 02:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
some people's need for a companion was
 
02:13:59.629 --> 02:13:59.639 align:start position:0%
also honored and this was the amendment
 
02:14:01.790 --> 02:14:01.800 align:start position:0%
suggested to me so I slapped my name on
 
02:14:05.030 --> 02:14:05.040 align:start position:0%
it and read it over it's 11 lines long
 
02:14:06.950 --> 02:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:14:08.450 --> 02:14:08.460 align:start position:0%
we can talk about it if you want to
 
02:14:11.030 --> 02:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
representative long uh
 
02:14:14.510 --> 02:14:14.520 align:start position:0%
think of Miss chairman we we didn't
 
02:14:16.609 --> 02:14:16.619 align:start position:0%
this amendment uh and I don't know where
 
02:14:18.589 --> 02:14:18.599 align:start position:0%
my caucus is because we worked on the
 
02:14:19.970 --> 02:14:19.980 align:start position:0%
original bill
 
02:14:21.890 --> 02:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
um so you want to take 10 minutes I
 
02:14:23.149 --> 02:14:23.159 align:start position:0%
don't need 10 minutes you want to take
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
five minutes two minutes you want to
 
02:14:26.149 --> 02:14:26.159 align:start position:0%

02:14:44.639 --> 02:14:50.270 align:start position:0%
 
careful

02:14:50.270 --> 02:14:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:50.280 --> 02:15:11.689 align:start position:0%
 
information

02:15:11.689 --> 02:15:11.699 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:24.430 --> 02:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:28.189 --> 02:15:28.199 align:start position:0%
someone wants to make them
 
02:22:19.330 --> 02:22:19.340 align:start position:0%

02:23:10.690 --> 02:23:10.700 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:14.210 --> 02:23:14.220 align:start position:0%
2023-0771h and moves that

02:23:25.979 --> 02:23:26.990 align:start position:0%
this is uh yeah then we'll have a
discussion

02:23:26.990 --> 02:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
02:23:28.969 --> 02:23:28.979 align:start position:0%
you can do it either way is there a
 
02:23:31.990 --> 02:23:32.000 align:start position:0%
second on the amendment
 
02:23:35.929 --> 02:23:35.939 align:start position:0%
okay so I can just put Dittos
 
02:23:39.349 --> 02:23:39.359 align:start position:0%
now we can discuss House Bill 438
 
02:23:43.790 --> 02:23:43.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment and as I said this uh seems to
 
02:23:46.730 --> 02:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
answer some of the concerns the judges
 
02:23:50.809 --> 02:23:50.819 align:start position:0%
had but it takes out the whole language
 
02:23:54.349 --> 02:23:54.359 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire Coalition against
 
02:23:57.349 --> 02:23:57.359 align:start position:0%
domestic violence employees it takes all
 
02:24:00.290 --> 02:24:00.300 align:start position:0%
of that out but it leaves the fact that
 
02:24:02.990 --> 02:24:03.000 align:start position:0%
at the discretion of the judge
 
02:24:08.570 --> 02:24:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:10.550 --> 02:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
02:24:13.730 --> 02:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman
 
02:24:17.030 --> 02:24:17.040 align:start position:0%
um with all due respect Mr chairman I um
 
02:24:20.389 --> 02:24:20.399 align:start position:0%
understand that family domestic violence
 
02:24:23.090 --> 02:24:23.100 align:start position:0%
situations can be very complex and
 
02:24:26.630 --> 02:24:26.640 align:start position:0%
convoluted and I don't
 
02:24:30.290 --> 02:24:30.300 align:start position:0%
um feel confident that this bill
 
02:24:34.130 --> 02:24:34.140 align:start position:0%
um would prevent any kind of coercion
 
02:24:36.110 --> 02:24:36.120 align:start position:0%
that could happen and even in a
 
02:24:37.969 --> 02:24:37.979 align:start position:0%
non-verbal way where the judge would not
 
02:24:41.690 --> 02:24:41.700 align:start position:0%
be able to see so for that reason I will
 
02:24:45.050 --> 02:24:45.060 align:start position:0%
not be supporting this bill okay
 
02:24:47.809 --> 02:24:47.819 align:start position:0%
it is your opinion that the judge would
 
02:24:50.389 --> 02:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
not have
 
02:24:53.030 --> 02:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
pretty much every time the discretion to
 
02:24:55.730 --> 02:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
sniff that out and say you can't do that
 
02:24:59.150 --> 02:24:59.160 align:start position:0%
thank you for asking me the question
 
02:25:02.210 --> 02:25:02.220 align:start position:0%
um I don't think that the judge could be
 
02:25:03.590 --> 02:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
um you know they have to pay attention
 
02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
to a lot of aspects of the courtroom I
 
02:25:07.130 --> 02:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
don't know if they would be able to pay
 
02:25:10.670 --> 02:25:10.680 align:start position:0%
attention to a sigh or a foot tapping
 
02:25:13.969 --> 02:25:13.979 align:start position:0%
um or a shrug
 
02:25:17.389 --> 02:25:17.399 align:start position:0%
thank you anyone else wish to share
 
02:25:19.490 --> 02:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
representative ball
 
02:25:22.130 --> 02:25:22.140 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson I too and am
 
02:25:25.370 --> 02:25:25.380 align:start position:0%
not comfortable supporting this I am
 
02:25:26.929 --> 02:25:26.939 align:start position:0%
concerned about the Optics that it
 
02:25:30.349 --> 02:25:30.359 align:start position:0%
presents um to me it makes the defendant
 
02:25:32.210 --> 02:25:32.220 align:start position:0%
look guilty
 
02:25:34.910 --> 02:25:34.920 align:start position:0%
um without when he's just being accused
 
02:25:36.410 --> 02:25:36.420 align:start position:0%
or she
 
02:25:39.530 --> 02:25:39.540 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:42.490 --> 02:25:42.500 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative
 
02:25:44.990 --> 02:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
02:25:45.000 --> 02:25:46.610 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
um

02:25:46.610 --> 02:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:25:51.110 --> 02:25:51.120 align:start position:0%
I I see the the admirable intent
 
02:25:53.090 --> 02:25:53.100 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
 
02:25:53.100 --> 02:25:55.429 align:start position:0%
of the amendment
however

02:25:55.429 --> 02:25:55.439 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:25:58.570 --> 02:25:58.580 align:start position:0%
we're looking at the bill
 
02:26:02.630 --> 02:26:02.640 align:start position:0%
under trying to understand that a person
 
02:26:06.050 --> 02:26:06.060 align:start position:0%
who was abused
 
02:26:10.490 --> 02:26:10.500 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:13.429 --> 02:26:13.439 align:start position:0%
but we're not looking at the fact that a
 
02:26:17.349 --> 02:26:17.359 align:start position:0%
person who is testifying may require
 
02:26:21.110 --> 02:26:21.120 align:start position:0%
a a comfort person and they are the
 
02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:23.389 align:start position:0%
a a comfort person and they are the
abuser

02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
abuser
 
02:26:26.990 --> 02:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't say anything either in the
 
02:26:31.130 --> 02:26:31.140 align:start position:0%
bill or this amendment concerning who
 
02:26:33.290 --> 02:26:33.300 align:start position:0%
should have the Comfort person and if
 
02:26:37.010 --> 02:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
it's the abuser the abuse is perpetuated
 
02:26:40.490 --> 02:26:40.500 align:start position:0%
and if it's the abused who knows whether
 
02:26:43.010 --> 02:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
the Comfort person is actually going to
 
02:26:44.990 --> 02:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
comfort that person
 
02:26:47.990 --> 02:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm very concerned about that aspect
 
02:26:51.290 --> 02:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
not being clear in either the bill or
 
02:26:54.530 --> 02:26:54.540 align:start position:0%
the amendment thank you thank you anyone
 
02:26:59.290 --> 02:26:59.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:01.150 --> 02:27:01.160 align:start position:0%
whichever one
 
02:27:03.410 --> 02:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
whichever one works as long as you don't
 
02:27:05.889 --> 02:27:05.899 align:start position:0%
call me late for dinner
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh I was a court security
 
02:27:10.910 --> 02:27:10.920 align:start position:0%
officer when I retired from the post
 
02:27:13.250 --> 02:27:13.260 align:start position:0%
office being a prior police officer
 
02:27:19.070 --> 02:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
and I so I served in uh domestic uh
 
02:27:19.080 --> 02:27:21.349 align:start position:0%
and I so I served in uh domestic uh
courts

02:27:21.349 --> 02:27:21.359 align:start position:0%
courts
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
as a the bailiff and I if I remember
 
02:27:26.880 --> 02:27:28.910 align:start position:0%
as a the bailiff and I if I remember
right

02:27:28.910 --> 02:27:28.920 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:27:30.290 --> 02:27:30.300 align:start position:0%
there was
 
02:27:34.010 --> 02:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
at the request of the abused of the
 
02:27:35.389 --> 02:27:35.399 align:start position:0%
grief party
 
02:27:38.389 --> 02:27:38.399 align:start position:0%
there was always someone with that
 
02:27:41.090 --> 02:27:41.100 align:start position:0%
individual who could not take part in
 
02:27:42.530 --> 02:27:42.540 align:start position:0%
testimony or anything like that would
 
02:27:44.630 --> 02:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
just sit there as I don't know Comfort
 
02:27:48.050 --> 02:27:48.060 align:start position:0%
person I guess just a reassurance so is
 
02:27:50.809 --> 02:27:50.819 align:start position:0%
this necessary or I thought it was
 
02:27:53.090 --> 02:27:53.100 align:start position:0%
already already in
 
02:27:57.770 --> 02:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:01.330 --> 02:28:01.340 align:start position:0%
Mr chair just clarify uh representative
 
02:28:04.490 --> 02:28:04.500 align:start position:0%
gagne's statement it is already in
 
02:28:07.190 --> 02:28:07.200 align:start position:0%
statute however it is only related to
 
02:28:07.200 --> 02:28:08.870 align:start position:0%
statute however it is only related to
Criminal

02:28:08.870 --> 02:28:08.880 align:start position:0%
Criminal
 
02:28:08.880 --> 02:28:10.309 align:start position:0%

representative gagne
 
02:28:18.050 --> 02:28:18.060 align:start position:0%
yeah probably domestic abuse so it it
 
02:28:20.510 --> 02:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
probably was a criminal thing I don't
 
02:28:22.670 --> 02:28:22.680 align:start position:0%
think we had anything to do with uh what
 
02:28:24.650 --> 02:28:24.660 align:start position:0%
we talked we're addressing here what is
 
02:28:26.389 --> 02:28:26.399 align:start position:0%

representative Nelson and her concerns

about this bill I think that the intent

is well-meaning but I just don't think
 
02:28:49.910 --> 02:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:53.090 --> 02:28:53.100 align:start position:0%

um any further any discussion from the
 
02:34:06.469 --> 02:34:06.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:10.929 --> 02:34:10.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:13.790 --> 02:34:13.800 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um
 
02:34:15.770 --> 02:34:15.780 align:start position:0%
with all due respect to the
 
02:34:19.130 --> 02:34:19.140 align:start position:0%
representative who um
 
02:34:20.870 --> 02:34:20.880 align:start position:0%
sponsored the bill
 
02:34:23.990 --> 02:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
um because of House Bill 10
 
02:34:27.530 --> 02:34:27.540 align:start position:0%
I did a lot of research on
 
02:34:27.540 --> 02:34:28.309 align:start position:0%
I did a lot of research on
um

02:34:28.309 --> 02:34:28.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:34:33.770 --> 02:34:33.780 align:start position:0%
transgender kids and lgbtq kids
 
02:34:37.929 --> 02:34:37.939 align:start position:0%
and I I understand through research
 
02:34:42.050 --> 02:34:42.060 align:start position:0%
exactly how emotional it is for the
 
02:34:45.050 --> 02:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
parents and the child
 
02:34:48.770 --> 02:34:48.780 align:start position:0%
if a parent takes a child to a
 
02:34:51.550 --> 02:34:51.560 align:start position:0%
psychologist or psychiatrist
 
02:34:54.110 --> 02:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
because they're talking about the fact
 
02:34:57.950 --> 02:34:57.960 align:start position:0%
that they may be transgender or a member
 
02:35:00.950 --> 02:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
of the LGBT whatever community and I I
 
02:35:02.809 --> 02:35:02.819 align:start position:0%
don't mean to throw that off I just
 
02:35:04.969 --> 02:35:04.979 align:start position:0%
can't keep up with all the letters and
 
02:35:07.550 --> 02:35:07.560 align:start position:0%
that's no disrespect meant
 
02:35:09.650 --> 02:35:09.660 align:start position:0%
but if a child goes to a psychologist
 
02:35:11.389 --> 02:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
with their parent
 
02:35:13.550 --> 02:35:13.560 align:start position:0%
and the psychologist or psychiatrist
 
02:35:16.130 --> 02:35:16.140 align:start position:0%
makes recommendations
 
02:35:18.290 --> 02:35:18.300 align:start position:0%
in the best interest of the child a
 
02:35:20.809 --> 02:35:20.819 align:start position:0%
loving parent is going to want to follow
 
02:35:23.349 --> 02:35:23.359 align:start position:0%
those recommendations
 
02:35:28.190 --> 02:35:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:31.610 --> 02:35:31.620 align:start position:0%
a child cannot have lower gender surgery
 
02:35:35.030 --> 02:35:35.040 align:start position:0%
until the after the age of 18.
 
02:35:37.130 --> 02:35:37.140 align:start position:0%
I checked with Boston Children's
 
02:35:39.950 --> 02:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
Hospital and they do not do any of that
 
02:35:42.730 --> 02:35:42.740 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment surgery
 
02:35:46.130 --> 02:35:46.140 align:start position:0%
hormonal therapy although it creates
 
02:35:50.090 --> 02:35:50.100 align:start position:0%
issues but once it's stopped
 
02:35:52.610 --> 02:35:52.620 align:start position:0%
um it can be reversed
 
02:35:56.630 --> 02:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
I don't feel that it's right for me to
 
02:36:00.349 --> 02:36:00.359 align:start position:0%
make a parent of a child who's involved
 
02:36:03.590 --> 02:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
in this type of an emotional conflict as
 
02:36:05.690 --> 02:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
well as the rest of the family I don't
 
02:36:08.030 --> 02:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
think it's right to make the parents a
 
02:36:08.040 --> 02:36:09.590 align:start position:0%
think it's right to make the parents a
criminal

02:36:09.590 --> 02:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
criminal
 
02:36:12.830 --> 02:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
so for that reason I support the itl
 
02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:14.750 align:start position:0%
so for that reason I support the itl
motion

02:36:14.750 --> 02:36:14.760 align:start position:0%
motion
 
02:36:16.610 --> 02:36:16.620 align:start position:0%
any further discussion representative
 
02:36:19.730 --> 02:36:19.740 align:start position:0%
Moulton thank you Mr chairman um I I
 
02:36:21.770 --> 02:36:21.780 align:start position:0%
appreciate what uh representative
 
02:36:24.290 --> 02:36:24.300 align:start position:0%
DeSimone had had just mentioned and if
 
02:36:25.550 --> 02:36:25.560 align:start position:0%
she hadn't mentioned it I would have
 
02:36:27.530 --> 02:36:27.540 align:start position:0%
already brought it up that
 
02:36:30.530 --> 02:36:30.540 align:start position:0%
um that this isn't even happening to
 
02:36:33.290 --> 02:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
kids under 18 they're not having their
 
02:36:35.870 --> 02:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
gender reassignment however it is
 
02:36:37.730 --> 02:36:37.740 align:start position:0%
appropriate medical treatment for there
 
02:36:41.690 --> 02:36:41.700 align:start position:0%
to be hormonal medications for teenagers
 
02:36:44.090 --> 02:36:44.100 align:start position:0%
whether puberty blockers or hormonal
 
02:36:46.010 --> 02:36:46.020 align:start position:0%
replacement Therapies
 
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
If the child is questioning their the
 
02:36:52.910 --> 02:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
gender that they were born with so I
 
02:36:55.309 --> 02:36:55.319 align:start position:0%
personally feel that I should not be
 
02:36:57.349 --> 02:36:57.359 align:start position:0%
making that decision that should be
 
02:36:59.290 --> 02:36:59.300 align:start position:0%
between a provider and their patient
 
02:37:02.330 --> 02:37:02.340 align:start position:0%
like a doctor in their patient
 
02:37:05.150 --> 02:37:05.160 align:start position:0%
um and not me as a representative so I
 
02:37:08.570 --> 02:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:11.150 --> 02:37:11.160 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
02:37:16.190 --> 02:37:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:18.410 --> 02:37:18.420 align:start position:0%
um I have to agree I don't think that we
 
02:37:20.210 --> 02:37:20.220 align:start position:0%
should get involved that in that
 
02:37:21.770 --> 02:37:21.780 align:start position:0%
discussion I think that should be
 
02:37:24.290 --> 02:37:24.300 align:start position:0%
between the parent and the child and
 
02:37:27.050 --> 02:37:27.060 align:start position:0%
deciding what steps to take forward when
 
02:37:31.010 --> 02:37:31.020 align:start position:0%
they choose to or accept their child the
 
02:37:34.250 --> 02:37:34.260 align:start position:0%
way that they are and making sure that
 
02:37:36.650 --> 02:37:36.660 align:start position:0%
they have the right tools to help their
 
02:37:38.630 --> 02:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
child in any way possible for those that
 
02:37:42.290 --> 02:37:42.300 align:start position:0%
are supportive is the best way that we
 
02:37:46.010 --> 02:37:46.020 align:start position:0%
can help lower this specifics of suicide
 
02:37:50.929 --> 02:37:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:52.910 --> 02:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
representative panic
 
02:37:54.770 --> 02:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
thank you for our
 
02:37:56.870 --> 02:37:56.880 align:start position:0%
um Vice chairman long for allowing me to
 
02:37:58.730 --> 02:37:58.740 align:start position:0%
ask this question
 
02:38:01.429 --> 02:38:01.439 align:start position:0%
I got an email from
 
02:38:03.770 --> 02:38:03.780 align:start position:0%
um Dr Jennifer Smith
 
02:38:08.450 --> 02:38:08.460 align:start position:0%
and my concern was the use of these
 
02:38:10.309 --> 02:38:10.319 align:start position:0%
hormone Therapies
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
on children
 
02:38:16.010 --> 02:38:16.020 align:start position:0%
ages 10 to 12 years old and I had asked
 
02:38:19.610 --> 02:38:19.620 align:start position:0%
if these hormone therapies were FDA
 
02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:20.750 align:start position:0%
if these hormone therapies were FDA
approved

02:38:20.750 --> 02:38:20.760 align:start position:0%
approved
 
02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
and the email that I was that was sent
 
02:38:27.889 --> 02:38:27.899 align:start position:0%
to me said that the potential harms
 
02:38:30.770 --> 02:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
versus the benefits allowing the use of
 
02:38:34.730 --> 02:38:34.740 align:start position:0%
medicine off label in this area of care
 
02:38:37.550 --> 02:38:37.560 align:start position:0%
so they are using this off label so that
 
02:38:39.110 --> 02:38:39.120 align:start position:0%
means that
 
02:38:42.349 --> 02:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
that translates in my mind that
 
02:38:46.250 --> 02:38:46.260 align:start position:0%
this is an experiment on the children
 
02:38:49.030 --> 02:38:49.040 align:start position:0%
if you're using some if you're
 
02:38:51.710 --> 02:38:51.720 align:start position:0%
transitioning these children
 
02:38:54.170 --> 02:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
off what medications that were not
 
02:38:58.490 --> 02:38:58.500 align:start position:0%
designed and there's no FDA studies
 
02:39:01.849 --> 02:39:01.859 align:start position:0%
this is an experiment that has me very
 
02:39:01.859 --> 02:39:03.429 align:start position:0%
this is an experiment that has me very
concerned

02:39:03.429 --> 02:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
concerned
 
02:39:03.439 --> 02:39:05.030 align:start position:0%
concerned
so

02:39:05.030 --> 02:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:39:05.040 --> 02:39:06.710 align:start position:0%
so
um

02:39:06.710 --> 02:39:06.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:39:10.730 --> 02:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
the last time they had experiments on
 
02:39:13.370 --> 02:39:13.380 align:start position:0%
children if I go back to looking at my
 
02:39:16.010 --> 02:39:16.020 align:start position:0%
history books was during
 
02:39:18.469 --> 02:39:18.479 align:start position:0%
the Nazis Gene
 
02:39:20.990 --> 02:39:21.000 align:start position:0%
during World War II
 
02:39:23.990 --> 02:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
so I think this is Criminal
 
02:39:26.030 --> 02:39:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:39:30.170 --> 02:39:30.180 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes uh representative DeSimone
 
02:39:33.050 --> 02:39:33.060 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately uh in one respect
 
02:39:34.849 --> 02:39:34.859 align:start position:0%
you're correct but in another we aren't
 
02:39:37.370 --> 02:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
you aren't uh the covid vaccine was an
 
02:39:39.349 --> 02:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
experimental drug that was given to
 
02:39:43.130 --> 02:39:43.140 align:start position:0%
children and that drug has been found to
 
02:39:47.030 --> 02:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
be able to uh cause sterilization in
 
02:39:49.309 --> 02:39:49.319 align:start position:0%
children but it was given to them with
 
02:39:49.319 --> 02:39:50.630 align:start position:0%
children but it was given to them with
the

02:39:50.630 --> 02:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:39:53.870 --> 02:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
um it was not FDA approved
 
02:39:56.210 --> 02:39:56.220 align:start position:0%
and it was given to them with the
 
02:39:56.220 --> 02:39:58.250 align:start position:0%
and it was given to them with the
government's

02:39:58.250 --> 02:39:58.260 align:start position:0%
government's
 
02:39:58.260 --> 02:39:59.170 align:start position:0%
government's
um

02:39:59.170 --> 02:39:59.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:40:03.110 --> 02:40:03.120 align:start position:0%
consent so and and it was mandated in
 
02:40:06.290 --> 02:40:06.300 align:start position:0%
some cases so I I just
 
02:40:08.830 --> 02:40:08.840 align:start position:0%
I don't think that any kid should have
 
02:40:11.389 --> 02:40:11.399 align:start position:0%
hormonal therapy either but I'm not the
 
02:40:12.950 --> 02:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
parent of
 
02:40:16.250 --> 02:40:16.260 align:start position:0%
a child who is transgender and I think
 
02:40:19.030 --> 02:40:19.040 align:start position:0%
that parent has a right
 
02:40:21.170 --> 02:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
go ahead okay
 
02:40:24.130 --> 02:40:24.140 align:start position:0%
um covid was an emergency
 
02:40:30.230 --> 02:40:30.240 align:start position:0%
so to prescribe a drug an unapproved FDA
 
02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:31.370 align:start position:0%
so to prescribe a drug an unapproved FDA
drug

02:40:31.370 --> 02:40:31.380 align:start position:0%
drug
 
02:40:34.190 --> 02:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
on an emergency basis
 
02:40:37.389 --> 02:40:37.399 align:start position:0%
I think is different than prescribing
 
02:40:39.650 --> 02:40:39.660 align:start position:0%
hormonal therapy
 
02:40:45.610 --> 02:40:45.620 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:50.929 --> 02:40:50.939 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:50.939 --> 02:40:52.610 align:start position:0%
 
well

02:40:52.610 --> 02:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
well
 
02:40:56.210 --> 02:40:56.220 align:start position:0%
I think that I no no no we we see it two
 
02:40:58.190 --> 02:40:58.200 align:start position:0%
different ways and we're trying to be
 
02:41:00.650 --> 02:41:00.660 align:start position:0%
respectful of everybody
 
02:41:00.660 --> 02:41:02.510 align:start position:0%
respectful of everybody
um

02:41:02.510 --> 02:41:02.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:05.450 --> 02:41:05.460 align:start position:0%
I don't see it as an emergency like
 
02:41:07.370 --> 02:41:07.380 align:start position:0%
hovid was
 
02:41:11.450 --> 02:41:11.460 align:start position:0%
we hear about the suicide maybe you know
 
02:41:14.270 --> 02:41:14.280 align:start position:0%
the uh the issue with suicides being
 
02:41:16.849 --> 02:41:16.859 align:start position:0%
very high on the transgender transgender
 
02:41:21.290 --> 02:41:21.300 align:start position:0%
Community maybe mental health counseling
 
02:41:25.010 --> 02:41:25.020 align:start position:0%
might be the Avenue and then when
 
02:41:28.010 --> 02:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
they're 18 years old they may want to
 
02:41:30.230 --> 02:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
transition over
 
02:41:30.240 --> 02:41:31.130 align:start position:0%
transition over
um

02:41:31.130 --> 02:41:31.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:41:33.469 --> 02:41:33.479 align:start position:0%
I think to compare it to the coveted
 
02:41:35.690 --> 02:41:35.700 align:start position:0%
vaccines is
 
02:41:38.510 --> 02:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
apples to oranges my opinion only thank
 
02:41:38.520 --> 02:41:40.190 align:start position:0%
apples to oranges my opinion only thank
you

02:41:40.190 --> 02:41:40.200 align:start position:0%
you
 
02:41:42.349 --> 02:41:42.359 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak representative
 
02:41:42.359 --> 02:41:45.170 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to speak representative
Perez

02:41:45.170 --> 02:41:45.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:49.010 --> 02:41:49.020 align:start position:0%
but what I understand in in I've been so
 
02:41:52.010 --> 02:41:52.020 align:start position:0%
involved with the LBGTQ community and
 
02:41:54.469 --> 02:41:54.479 align:start position:0%
the transgender Community because I want
 
02:41:56.270 --> 02:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
to have more respect and understanding
 
02:41:58.309 --> 02:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
what they go through
 
02:42:00.830 --> 02:42:00.840 align:start position:0%
in some cases it's necessary it's
 
02:42:04.130 --> 02:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
medical necessary so I don't believe
 
02:42:06.590 --> 02:42:06.600 align:start position:0%
we're pushing something in people's
 
02:42:08.809 --> 02:42:08.819 align:start position:0%
bodies but if they probably make the
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
decision it does what they want to do
 
02:42:12.290 --> 02:42:12.300 align:start position:0%
for the child that should have the right
 
02:42:16.389 --> 02:42:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:18.950 --> 02:42:18.960 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
 
02:42:18.960 --> 02:42:21.590 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson
I

02:42:21.590 --> 02:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
I
 
02:42:23.630 --> 02:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is about
 
02:42:25.070 --> 02:42:25.080 align:start position:0%
um do we believe that this is child
 
02:42:25.080 --> 02:42:26.090 align:start position:0%
um do we believe that this is child
abuse

02:42:26.090 --> 02:42:26.100 align:start position:0%
abuse
 
02:42:27.710 --> 02:42:27.720 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
02:42:29.389 --> 02:42:29.399 align:start position:0%
um for me
 
02:42:32.030 --> 02:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
um regardless of what I may think or I
 
02:42:33.950 --> 02:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
may not think
 
02:42:37.309 --> 02:42:37.319 align:start position:0%
um transgender hormone therapy puberty
 
02:42:37.319 --> 02:42:38.510 align:start position:0%
um transgender hormone therapy puberty
blockers

02:42:38.510 --> 02:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
blockers
 
02:42:43.070 --> 02:42:43.080 align:start position:0%
are used off label but so are extreme
 
02:42:43.080 --> 02:42:45.770 align:start position:0%
are used off label but so are extreme
chemotherapy

02:42:45.770 --> 02:42:45.780 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy
 
02:42:45.780 --> 02:42:46.630 align:start position:0%
chemotherapy
um

02:42:46.630 --> 02:42:46.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:42:50.270 --> 02:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
treatments as a last resort for a very
 
02:42:54.530 --> 02:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
ill child with cancer and we oh we're
 
02:42:56.870 --> 02:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
not saying that those parents are being
 
02:42:59.570 --> 02:42:59.580 align:start position:0%
abused I just saw a testimony that
 
02:43:01.610 --> 02:43:01.620 align:start position:0%
parents are being advised by medical
 
02:43:04.130 --> 02:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
professionals whether it be their
 
02:43:05.809 --> 02:43:05.819 align:start position:0%
pediatrician who's seen their child
 
02:43:09.250 --> 02:43:09.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:12.469 --> 02:43:12.479 align:start position:0%
telling them that this isn't a necessary
 
02:43:12.479 --> 02:43:15.070 align:start position:0%
telling them that this isn't a necessary
Medical

02:43:15.070 --> 02:43:15.080 align:start position:0%
Medical
 
02:43:17.570 --> 02:43:17.580 align:start position:0%
intervention for lack of better terms
 
02:43:19.429 --> 02:43:19.439 align:start position:0%
and um
 
02:43:22.070 --> 02:43:22.080 align:start position:0%
for that reason I don't think that that
 
02:43:24.469 --> 02:43:24.479 align:start position:0%
falls under per um
 
02:43:27.070 --> 02:43:27.080 align:start position:0%
the definition of child is thank you
 
02:43:29.270 --> 02:43:29.280 align:start position:0%
representative Moulton
 
02:43:31.010 --> 02:43:31.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
02:43:32.929 --> 02:43:32.939 align:start position:0%
um it seems like there's a discrepancy
 
02:43:34.969 --> 02:43:34.979 align:start position:0%
between what the understanding of
 
02:43:34.979 --> 02:43:36.590 align:start position:0%
between what the understanding of
off-label

02:43:36.590 --> 02:43:36.600 align:start position:0%
off-label
 
02:43:39.230 --> 02:43:39.240 align:start position:0%
usage of medications are for it's not
 
02:43:42.650 --> 02:43:42.660 align:start position:0%
it's not like an experiment they have
 
02:43:45.490 --> 02:43:45.500 align:start position:0%
studies that back this up for example
 
02:43:48.650 --> 02:43:48.660 align:start position:0%
Lamictal is used as an anti-seizure
 
02:43:51.790 --> 02:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
medication it can also be off label use
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
for mood stabilization okay there's a
 
02:43:57.889 --> 02:43:57.899 align:start position:0%
lot of different medications that are
 
02:44:01.309 --> 02:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
used in the medical field off label
 
02:44:03.650 --> 02:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
but it's not that they don't know what
 
02:44:05.750 --> 02:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
the expected response is they're still
 
02:44:05.760 --> 02:44:07.070 align:start position:0%
the expected response is they're still
studies

02:44:07.070 --> 02:44:07.080 align:start position:0%
studies
 
02:44:10.010 --> 02:44:10.020 align:start position:0%
about them so
 
02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
to make a broad generalization that
 
02:44:15.889 --> 02:44:15.899 align:start position:0%
off-label use is an experiment is an
 
02:44:15.899 --> 02:44:17.389 align:start position:0%
off-label use is an experiment is an
extreme

02:44:17.389 --> 02:44:17.399 align:start position:0%
extreme
 
02:44:17.399 --> 02:44:19.610 align:start position:0%
extreme
conclusion

02:44:19.610 --> 02:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
conclusion
 
02:44:21.469 --> 02:44:21.479 align:start position:0%
um because that's just not that's just
 
02:44:22.550 --> 02:44:22.560 align:start position:0%
not the case
 
02:44:24.050 --> 02:44:24.060 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:44:28.670 --> 02:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh this is consistent your statement is
 
02:44:30.650 --> 02:44:30.660 align:start position:0%
consistent with what the medical staff
 
02:44:32.870 --> 02:44:32.880 align:start position:0%
at the medical center of which I'm CEO
 
02:44:36.770 --> 02:44:36.780 align:start position:0%
has told me my concern is surgery
 
02:44:40.969 --> 02:44:40.979 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:51.050 --> 02:44:51.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:55.010 --> 02:44:55.020 align:start position:0%

02:46:12.530 --> 02:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
blurb now I might suggest and this is a
 
02:46:14.870 --> 02:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
general statement that I make as you
 
02:46:17.030 --> 02:46:17.040 align:start position:0%
know about every other time we're
 
02:46:17.040 --> 02:46:18.670 align:start position:0%
know about every other time we're
together

02:46:18.670 --> 02:46:18.680 align:start position:0%
together
 
02:46:23.330 --> 02:46:23.340 align:start position:0%
bills are sometimes rise and fall on how
 
02:46:25.610 --> 02:46:25.620 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor presents the bill to
 
02:46:27.410 --> 02:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
02:46:30.710 --> 02:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
and who brings relevant information to
 
02:46:31.790 --> 02:46:31.800 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
02:46:35.150 --> 02:46:35.160 align:start position:0%
other people and answers and anticipates
 
02:46:37.790 --> 02:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
and answers questions I think there's
 
02:46:40.130 --> 02:46:40.140 align:start position:0%
something in this bill that appeals to
 
02:46:44.630 --> 02:46:44.640 align:start position:0%
me but absent all of those things I had
 
02:46:53.270 --> 02:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:04.910 --> 02:47:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:47:09.349 --> 02:47:09.359 align:start position:0%
this concludes the hearing on 4 17. wow
 
02:47:11.530 --> 02:47:11.540 align:start position:0%
look at this
 
02:47:15.410 --> 02:47:15.420 align:start position:0%
meet burrow and on time
 
02:47:17.870 --> 02:47:17.880 align:start position:0%
not not terribly neat but I tried to
 
02:47:20.349 --> 02:47:20.359 align:start position:0%
make it legible
 
02:47:22.849 --> 02:47:22.859 align:start position:0%
we'll talk about the use of the comma at
 
02:47:24.770 --> 02:47:24.780 align:start position:0%
another time
 
02:47:28.010 --> 02:47:28.020 align:start position:0%
if in doubt put them in
 
02:47:33.290 --> 02:47:33.300 align:start position:0%
okay that is 417 uh and now 475 we can
 
02:47:37.090 --> 02:47:37.100 align:start position:0%
exactly I open the exact session on 475
 
02:47:40.309 --> 02:47:40.319 align:start position:0%
and representative posts you may come up
 
02:47:43.070 --> 02:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
because you have that
 
02:47:46.010 --> 02:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
fresh off the press be careful when you
 
02:47:51.469 --> 02:47:51.479 align:start position:0%
touch it it's hot amendment 10 16.
 
02:47:52.910 --> 02:47:52.920 align:start position:0%
I know
 
02:47:54.650 --> 02:47:54.660 align:start position:0%
so if you don't have enough if I didn't
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
divvy them up enough representative post
 
02:47:59.990 --> 02:48:00.000 align:start position:0%
please tell us what your Amendment does
 
02:48:03.170 --> 02:48:03.180 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you very much
 
02:48:07.070 --> 02:48:07.080 align:start position:0%
um for allowing me to present this I
 
02:48:10.190 --> 02:48:10.200 align:start position:0%
thank the chairman and the committee
 
02:48:10.200 --> 02:48:10.790 align:start position:0%
thank the chairman and the committee
um

02:48:10.790 --> 02:48:10.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:48:13.010 --> 02:48:13.020 align:start position:0%
do I need to do for the record I only
 
02:48:13.020 --> 02:48:14.210 align:start position:0%
do I need to do for the record I only
supposed

02:48:14.210 --> 02:48:14.220 align:start position:0%
supposed
 
02:48:17.090 --> 02:48:17.100 align:start position:0%
I am Lisa post from lineborough I'm a
 
02:48:17.100 --> 02:48:18.710 align:start position:0%
I am Lisa post from lineborough I'm a
representative

02:48:18.710 --> 02:48:18.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:19.929 align:start position:0%
representative
um so

02:48:19.929 --> 02:48:19.939 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:48:24.110 --> 02:48:24.120 align:start position:0%
what we did was we simplified it
 
02:48:27.410 --> 02:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
um and so uh
 
02:48:29.990 --> 02:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
it is still the right to pres present
 
02:48:32.150 --> 02:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
evidence and testimony
 
02:48:32.160 --> 02:48:33.590 align:start position:0%
evidence and testimony
and

02:48:33.590 --> 02:48:33.600 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:48:35.510 --> 02:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
the parties in any family court
 
02:48:38.510 --> 02:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
proceeding shall have the right to
 
02:48:41.630 --> 02:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
present the evidence and testimony
 
02:48:44.030 --> 02:48:44.040 align:start position:0%
but the change is the presiding judge
 
02:48:47.389 --> 02:48:47.399 align:start position:0%
magistrate or meritable marital Master
 
02:48:49.190 --> 02:48:49.200 align:start position:0%
shall follow the New Hampshire Rules of
 
02:48:51.290 --> 02:48:51.300 align:start position:0%
Evidence when admitting such evidence
 
02:48:54.349 --> 02:48:54.359 align:start position:0%
and testimony this right shall not be
 
02:48:56.090 --> 02:48:56.100 align:start position:0%
limited by the rules of the Circuit
 
02:48:59.170 --> 02:48:59.180 align:start position:0%
Court Family Division if for any reason
 
02:49:02.090 --> 02:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
evidence or testimony is not admitted
 
02:49:04.870 --> 02:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
the reason shall be noted in the record
 
02:49:09.290 --> 02:49:09.300 align:start position:0%
which in the note noted being noted in
 
02:49:12.469 --> 02:49:12.479 align:start position:0%
the record is just simply they've noted
 
02:49:18.110 --> 02:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:21.469 --> 02:49:21.479 align:start position:0%
so what I think this does is this allows
 
02:49:24.770 --> 02:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
the parties to present it
 
02:49:28.550 --> 02:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
and follow the New Hampshire Rules of
 
02:49:32.929 --> 02:49:32.939 align:start position:0%
Evidence when admitting such and I was
 
02:49:35.150 --> 02:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
just made aware that there is a bill
 
02:49:38.809 --> 02:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
that you have to hear
 
02:49:41.030 --> 02:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence is that correct I
 
02:49:42.530 --> 02:49:42.540 align:start position:0%
think so
 
02:49:44.330 --> 02:49:44.340 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how that will affect
 
02:49:44.340 --> 02:49:45.950 align:start position:0%
so I don't know how that will affect
this

02:49:45.950 --> 02:49:45.960 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:49:45.960 --> 02:49:47.690 align:start position:0%
this
um but

02:49:47.690 --> 02:49:47.700 align:start position:0%
um but
 
02:49:47.700 --> 02:49:49.130 align:start position:0%
um but
um

02:49:49.130 --> 02:49:49.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:49:51.469 --> 02:49:51.479 align:start position:0%
I think this is a better bill this way
 
02:49:53.809 --> 02:49:53.819 align:start position:0%
because it allows
 
02:49:57.110 --> 02:49:57.120 align:start position:0%
um the court to make those decisions on
 
02:49:59.389 --> 02:49:59.399 align:start position:0%
their own now this begs the question
 
02:50:01.550 --> 02:50:01.560 align:start position:0%
what is the New Hampshire Rules of
 
02:50:04.690 --> 02:50:04.700 align:start position:0%
Evidence what are they for Circuit Court
 
02:50:06.950 --> 02:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking you it's a rhetorical
 
02:50:08.690 --> 02:50:08.700 align:start position:0%
question right because somebody could
 
02:50:10.190 --> 02:50:10.200 align:start position:0%
look at it and say wait a minute I've
 
02:50:13.010 --> 02:50:13.020 align:start position:0%
watched 52 episodes of Law and Order and
 
02:50:15.110 --> 02:50:15.120 align:start position:0%
that's not how they behaved number one
 
02:50:17.450 --> 02:50:17.460 align:start position:0%
that's TV and number two that's Criminal
 
02:50:21.110 --> 02:50:21.120 align:start position:0%
Court I don't think people who object
 
02:50:23.210 --> 02:50:23.220 align:start position:0%
that the Rules of Evidence are not being
 
02:50:25.610 --> 02:50:25.620 align:start position:0%
followed always know what they are they
 
02:50:27.410 --> 02:50:27.420 align:start position:0%
may well be followed you just didn't
 
02:50:29.270 --> 02:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
like how it broke your way
 
02:50:31.190 --> 02:50:31.200 align:start position:0%
so when we talk about the Rules of
 
02:50:33.349 --> 02:50:33.359 align:start position:0%
Evidence we are not talking about what
 
02:50:35.389 --> 02:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
we wish they were what we think they are
 
02:50:37.670 --> 02:50:37.680 align:start position:0%
but what in fact The Rules of Evidence
 
02:50:41.210 --> 02:50:41.220 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire Circuit Court are as of
 
02:50:42.050 --> 02:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
right now
 
02:50:44.929 --> 02:50:44.939 align:start position:0%
would you agree I I would agree and I
 
02:50:48.670 --> 02:50:48.680 align:start position:0%
would say the judge magistrate
 
02:50:51.650 --> 02:50:51.660 align:start position:0%
can always explain what that is when
 
02:50:54.830 --> 02:50:54.840 align:start position:0%
they're not accepting it right so I
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
think that it's not your main for
 
02:51:00.730 --> 02:51:00.740 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:04.670 --> 02:51:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:08.570 --> 02:51:08.580 align:start position:0%
okay seeing none chair will entertain a
 
02:51:10.370 --> 02:51:10.380 align:start position:0%

turnaround on this and

chair would recommend uh emotion from
 
02:51:16.380 --> 02:51:20.690 align:start position:0%
chair would recommend uh emotion from
someone

02:51:20.690 --> 02:51:20.700 align:start position:0%

any further discussion on the amendment
 
02:52:40.070 --> 02:52:40.080 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond
 
02:52:42.290 --> 02:52:42.300 align:start position:0%
um thank you and thank you for indulging
 
02:52:43.610 --> 02:52:43.620 align:start position:0%
me everyone
 
02:52:46.130 --> 02:52:46.140 align:start position:0%
um I'm still I was just looking up at
 
02:52:49.010 --> 02:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
the rules of of evidence
 
02:52:51.950 --> 02:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
um on Google for New Hampshire
 
02:52:54.050 --> 02:52:54.060 align:start position:0%
um and it talks about
 
02:52:57.110 --> 02:52:57.120 align:start position:0%
um offers of proof and testimony and you
 
02:52:58.809 --> 02:52:58.819 align:start position:0%
know being the right to being
 
02:53:02.510 --> 02:53:02.520 align:start position:0%
cross-examined and I'm
 
02:53:07.130 --> 02:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
unsure about how that will apply and
 
02:53:10.969 --> 02:53:10.979 align:start position:0%
work in Family Court situations
 
02:53:13.570 --> 02:53:13.580 align:start position:0%
I because I just don't have the
 
02:53:16.849 --> 02:53:16.859 align:start position:0%
experience in in divorce matters and
 
02:53:19.630 --> 02:53:19.640 align:start position:0%
custody matters to really visualize this
 
02:53:24.349 --> 02:53:24.359 align:start position:0%
so if someone is providing evidence
 
02:53:27.769 --> 02:53:27.779 align:start position:0%
do they usually get cross-examined in a
 
02:53:31.429 --> 02:53:31.439 align:start position:0%
divorce case do they usually have the
 
02:53:33.530 --> 02:53:33.540 align:start position:0%
same burden of proof and divorce as they
 
02:53:36.230 --> 02:53:36.240 align:start position:0%
would in other court cases will this
 
02:53:38.330 --> 02:53:38.340 align:start position:0%
affect that and I don't know the answer
 
02:53:41.030 --> 02:53:41.040 align:start position:0%
and it's freaking me out
 
02:53:44.570 --> 02:53:44.580 align:start position:0%
attorney head could you speak to that
 
02:53:46.370 --> 02:53:46.380 align:start position:0%
and you were Consulting with someone
 
02:53:47.990 --> 02:53:48.000 align:start position:0%
else in the committee so would you ask
 
02:53:50.330 --> 02:53:50.340 align:start position:0%
attorney had the question please thank
 
02:53:51.710 --> 02:53:51.720 align:start position:0%
you attorney head could you please
 
02:53:53.929 --> 02:53:53.939 align:start position:0%
explain a little bit more about the
 
02:53:57.710 --> 02:53:57.720 align:start position:0%
rules of evidence and how this amendment
 
02:54:00.170 --> 02:54:00.180 align:start position:0%
will affect Family Court proceedings
 
02:54:01.910 --> 02:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
that I'm not familiar with like divorce
 
02:54:04.670 --> 02:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
and custody and so thank you for the
 
02:54:04.680 --> 02:54:05.809 align:start position:0%
and custody and so thank you for the
question

02:54:05.809 --> 02:54:05.819 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:54:08.809 --> 02:54:08.819 align:start position:0%
um so current practice there's so the
 
02:54:11.030 --> 02:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence are one set of rules
 
02:54:13.570 --> 02:54:13.580 align:start position:0%
they apply to all courts they apply to
 
02:54:17.450 --> 02:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
civil cases depending on the Civil Rules
 
02:54:18.590 --> 02:54:18.600 align:start position:0%
of Evidence really what we're talking
 
02:54:20.469 --> 02:54:20.479 align:start position:0%
about primarily here
 
02:54:20.479 --> 02:54:22.130 align:start position:0%
about primarily here
the

02:54:22.130 --> 02:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:54:23.690 --> 02:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
um so you can look up The Rules of
 
02:54:25.070 --> 02:54:25.080 align:start position:0%
Evidence there are a lot of them they're
 
02:54:28.490 --> 02:54:28.500 align:start position:0%
complicated and I went to law school and
 
02:54:30.469 --> 02:54:30.479 align:start position:0%
I still screwed them up once in a while
 
02:54:32.870 --> 02:54:32.880 align:start position:0%
but the current Rule and family division
 
02:54:37.969 --> 02:54:37.979 align:start position:0%
is Rule 2.2 which says that
 
02:54:37.979 --> 02:54:38.929 align:start position:0%
is Rule 2.2 which says that
um

02:54:38.929 --> 02:54:38.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:54:40.849 --> 02:54:40.859 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Rules of Evidence do not
 
02:54:42.950 --> 02:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
apply to the actions listed above we're
 
02:54:44.450 --> 02:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
talking generally about Family Division
 
02:54:46.730 --> 02:54:46.740 align:start position:0%
and those however the court at its
 
02:54:48.830 --> 02:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
discretion May utilize The Rules of
 
02:54:50.870 --> 02:54:50.880 align:start position:0%
Evidence to enhance predictable orderly
 
02:54:52.670 --> 02:54:52.680 align:start position:0%
fair and reliable presentation of
 
02:54:52.680 --> 02:54:53.630 align:start position:0%
fair and reliable presentation of
evidence

02:54:53.630 --> 02:54:53.640 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
02:54:56.030 --> 02:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
one thing to understand about the Rules
 
02:54:58.429 --> 02:54:58.439 align:start position:0%
of Evidence in terms of thinking about
 
02:55:01.309 --> 02:55:01.319 align:start position:0%
them sort of generally is they are an
 
02:55:01.319 --> 02:55:02.750 align:start position:0%
them sort of generally is they are an
exclusionary

02:55:02.750 --> 02:55:02.760 align:start position:0%
exclusionary
 
02:55:07.010 --> 02:55:07.020 align:start position:0%
set of rules they they decide what is or
 
02:55:08.690 --> 02:55:08.700 align:start position:0%
more importantly what is not being
 
02:55:08.700 --> 02:55:09.769 align:start position:0%
more importantly what is not being
admitted

02:55:09.769 --> 02:55:09.779 align:start position:0%
admitted
 
02:55:14.690 --> 02:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
so if for example somebody says
 
02:55:19.309 --> 02:55:19.319 align:start position:0%
my soon to be ex-spouse told me that
 
02:55:23.330 --> 02:55:23.340 align:start position:0%
they were going to pick up my child
 
02:55:26.809 --> 02:55:26.819 align:start position:0%
that is technically hearsay
 
02:55:30.290 --> 02:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
um and and then it gets into why is that
 
02:55:33.889 --> 02:55:33.899 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:36.170 --> 02:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
if if you're going to try to apply the
 
02:55:38.830 --> 02:55:38.840 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence
 
02:55:41.690 --> 02:55:41.700 align:start position:0%
at a very technical level require that
 
02:55:44.570 --> 02:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
the Rules of Evidence be applied
 
02:55:47.809 --> 02:55:47.819 align:start position:0%
then evidence which today under the
 
02:55:49.670 --> 02:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
current process could be introduced
 
02:55:51.830 --> 02:55:51.840 align:start position:0%
might very well get excluded because
 
02:55:54.349 --> 02:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence tend to be an
 
02:55:56.870 --> 02:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
exclusionary set of rules they decide
 
02:55:59.090 --> 02:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
essentially you didn't follow all the
 
02:56:01.250 --> 02:56:01.260 align:start position:0%
steps so we're going to keep that from
 
02:56:02.630 --> 02:56:02.640 align:start position:0%
getting in
 
02:56:05.090 --> 02:56:05.100 align:start position:0%
which is sort of contrary to what the
 
02:56:07.010 --> 02:56:07.020 align:start position:0%
original sort of intent of this bill is
 
02:56:09.889 --> 02:56:09.899 align:start position:0%
which is trying to get more stuff in
 
02:56:12.469 --> 02:56:12.479 align:start position:0%
um but that said you also then add to
 
02:56:14.809 --> 02:56:14.819 align:start position:0%
that the layer of
 
02:56:17.150 --> 02:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
yes the judge can explain why the rule
 
02:56:19.790 --> 02:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
of evidence would exclude this piece of
 
02:56:19.800 --> 02:56:20.809 align:start position:0%
of evidence would exclude this piece of
evidence

02:56:20.809 --> 02:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
evidence
 
02:56:22.610 --> 02:56:22.620 align:start position:0%
but now that person is stuck they're in
 
02:56:24.110 --> 02:56:24.120 align:start position:0%
trial they don't have another shot at
 
02:56:26.690 --> 02:56:26.700 align:start position:0%
this they're in the proceeding so they
 
02:56:28.610 --> 02:56:28.620 align:start position:0%
may have understood coming in that this
 
02:56:30.530 --> 02:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
get introduced but because of the strict
 
02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
adherence to The Rules of Evidence it
 
02:56:36.230 --> 02:56:36.240 align:start position:0%
may be excluded as a result
 
02:56:38.690 --> 02:56:38.700 align:start position:0%
so you know
 
02:56:40.910 --> 02:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
and we're talking you know relevance
 
02:56:45.230 --> 02:56:45.240 align:start position:0%
hearsay character if if for example in
 
02:56:48.650 --> 02:56:48.660 align:start position:0%
the hearsay example my soon-to-be
 
02:56:50.809 --> 02:56:50.819 align:start position:0%
ex-spouse said that they were going to
 
02:56:53.870 --> 02:56:53.880 align:start position:0%
the school to pick up my child if it's
 
02:56:55.910 --> 02:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
being introduced for the truth of the
 
02:56:58.130 --> 02:56:58.140 align:start position:0%
matter asserted which is the language in
 
02:57:00.290 --> 02:57:00.300 align:start position:0%
the rule if it's being introduced
 
02:57:03.469 --> 02:57:03.479 align:start position:0%
because the judge that person wants to
 
02:57:05.510 --> 02:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
know wants the judge to know that the
 
02:57:08.090 --> 02:57:08.100 align:start position:0%
ex-spouse is went to the school to pick
 
02:57:10.429 --> 02:57:10.439 align:start position:0%
up the child that's hearsay it should be
 
02:57:13.370 --> 02:57:13.380 align:start position:0%
excluded if they are introducing it to
 
02:57:15.950 --> 02:57:15.960 align:start position:0%
say as a result of hearing that I went
 
02:57:18.769 --> 02:57:18.779 align:start position:0%
to the school also it technically is not
 
02:57:20.210 --> 02:57:20.220 align:start position:0%
being introduced for the truth of the
 
02:57:22.190 --> 02:57:22.200 align:start position:0%
matter asserted the ability the
 
02:57:24.889 --> 02:57:24.899 align:start position:0%
likelihood that a person who's not
 
02:57:27.950 --> 02:57:27.960 align:start position:0%
appearing in court who may have
 
02:57:31.070 --> 02:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
you know limited education has no
 
02:57:32.330 --> 02:57:32.340 align:start position:0%
experience with the Rules of Evidence
 
02:57:34.070 --> 02:57:34.080 align:start position:0%
may have mental health issues because
 
02:57:36.830 --> 02:57:36.840 align:start position:0%
again vast majority of people in these
 
02:57:39.170 --> 02:57:39.180 align:start position:0%
cases are not represented
 
02:57:41.929 --> 02:57:41.939 align:start position:0%
that's a kind of a subtle distinction as
 
02:57:44.090 --> 02:57:44.100 align:start position:0%
to what whether or not they're trying to
 
02:57:45.590 --> 02:57:45.600 align:start position:0%
introduce it for the truth of the matter
 
02:57:45.600 --> 02:57:47.690 align:start position:0%
introduce it for the truth of the matter
asserted

02:57:47.690 --> 02:57:47.700 align:start position:0%
asserted
 
02:57:51.469 --> 02:57:51.479 align:start position:0%
today under the current process if in
 
02:57:54.889 --> 02:57:54.899 align:start position:0%
order to ensure a predictable orderly
 
02:57:57.950 --> 02:57:57.960 align:start position:0%
and reliable presentation of of evidence
 
02:57:59.630 --> 02:57:59.640 align:start position:0%
the judge can have some discretion
 
02:58:01.910 --> 02:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's what we have today if you apply
 
02:58:04.849 --> 02:58:04.859 align:start position:0%
the rule strictly you're you're you're
 
02:58:07.610 --> 02:58:07.620 align:start position:0%
applying exclusionary rules strictly
 
02:58:09.110 --> 02:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
against parties who may not understand
 
02:58:09.120 --> 02:58:10.550 align:start position:0%
against parties who may not understand
them

02:58:10.550 --> 02:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:58:12.769 --> 02:58:12.779 align:start position:0%
I may have answered your question
 
02:58:14.750 --> 02:58:14.760 align:start position:0%

02:58:24.410 --> 02:58:24.420 align:start position:0%
dcif cases in Family Division yes okay
 
02:58:33.050 --> 02:58:33.060 align:start position:0%

okay
 
02:58:37.610 --> 02:58:37.620 align:start position:0%
I do yes representative ball sorry thank
 
02:58:38.870 --> 02:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
you chairman thank you for taking my
 
02:58:41.050 --> 02:58:41.060 align:start position:0%
question so I'm still left a little bit
 
02:58:43.969 --> 02:58:43.979 align:start position:0%
unsure of I understand that you're
 
02:58:46.429 --> 02:58:46.439 align:start position:0%
saying because of limited education or
 
02:58:49.490 --> 02:58:49.500 align:start position:0%
limited health or whatever
 
02:58:49.500 --> 02:58:50.389 align:start position:0%
limited health or whatever
um

02:58:50.389 --> 02:58:50.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:58:52.670 --> 02:58:52.680 align:start position:0%
and you had brought up wealth and all of
 
02:58:55.910 --> 02:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
those other things but I'm still
 
02:58:57.469 --> 02:58:57.479 align:start position:0%
if you have one party with
 
02:58:59.809 --> 02:58:59.819 align:start position:0%
representation in one party without then
 
02:59:01.969 --> 02:59:01.979 align:start position:0%
you still have an un you still have an
 
02:59:05.809 --> 02:59:05.819 align:start position:0%
imbalance there so how does the party
 
02:59:05.819 --> 02:59:07.010 align:start position:0%
imbalance there so how does the party
um

02:59:07.010 --> 02:59:07.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:59:09.889 --> 02:59:09.899 align:start position:0%
without the Savvy attorney who knows how
 
02:59:12.490 --> 02:59:12.500 align:start position:0%
to get evidence in through testimony
 
02:59:15.650 --> 02:59:15.660 align:start position:0%
how do those people ever get their voice
 
02:59:17.750 --> 02:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
heard if they can't present the evidence
 
02:59:20.450 --> 02:59:20.460 align:start position:0%
even if they do it maybe it wasn't done
 
02:59:22.190 --> 02:59:22.200 align:start position:0%
correctly or maybe the the court could
 
02:59:24.050 --> 02:59:24.060 align:start position:0%
help guide them and how to get their
 
02:59:25.630 --> 02:59:25.640 align:start position:0%
evidence in there
 
02:59:29.150 --> 02:59:29.160 align:start position:0%
how do we balance out that imbalance
 
02:59:31.130 --> 02:59:31.140 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question one the
 
02:59:33.550 --> 02:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
court really can't help somebody
 
02:59:36.590 --> 02:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
improve their case they can't say how to
 
02:59:37.910 --> 02:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
introduce evidence they can talk
 
02:59:40.370 --> 02:59:40.380 align:start position:0%
generally about sort of what it is they
 
02:59:42.349 --> 02:59:42.359 align:start position:0%
should do but not help them prove their
 
02:59:46.070 --> 02:59:46.080 align:start position:0%
case in terms of this amendment you were
 
02:59:49.190 --> 02:59:49.200 align:start position:0%
actually shifting that imbalance in
 
02:59:52.190 --> 02:59:52.200 align:start position:0%
favor of represented parties because the
 
02:59:54.349 --> 02:59:54.359 align:start position:0%
only if you have a an attorney and a pro
 
02:59:56.630 --> 02:59:56.640 align:start position:0%
se party that attorney is going to have
 
02:59:58.309 --> 02:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
a much better understanding of the rules
 
03:00:01.849 --> 03:00:01.859 align:start position:0%
of evidence and have the opportunity
 
03:00:04.370 --> 03:00:04.380 align:start position:0%
to know when to object what to object to
 
03:00:06.530 --> 03:00:06.540 align:start position:0%
what the rule is going to be and is more
 
03:00:08.929 --> 03:00:08.939 align:start position:0%
likely to be able to exclude the
 
03:00:10.610 --> 03:00:10.620 align:start position:0%
information that somebody is trying to
 
03:00:12.590 --> 03:00:12.600 align:start position:0%
introduce who's not represented has
 
03:00:14.530 --> 03:00:14.540 align:start position:0%
never experienced The Rules of Evidence
 
03:00:17.389 --> 03:00:17.399 align:start position:0%
and is is really just there to try to
 
03:00:19.429 --> 03:00:19.439 align:start position:0%
explain their case
 
03:00:21.410 --> 03:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
um by by whatever information is
 
03:00:23.750 --> 03:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
available to them so I think you are
 
03:00:23.760 --> 03:00:24.950 align:start position:0%
available to them so I think you are
actually

03:00:24.950 --> 03:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
actually
 
03:00:27.950 --> 03:00:27.960 align:start position:0%
shifting that that power
 
03:00:30.230 --> 03:00:30.240 align:start position:0%
towards the represented party who may be
 
03:00:31.730 --> 03:00:31.740 align:start position:0%
wealthier because they can afford the
 
03:00:32.990 --> 03:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
attorney and what have you so I think
 
03:00:34.309 --> 03:00:34.319 align:start position:0%
this actually shifts it in that
 
03:00:36.530 --> 03:00:36.540 align:start position:0%
direction even more
 
03:00:39.050 --> 03:00:39.060 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you and maybe this is
 
03:00:41.389 --> 03:00:41.399 align:start position:0%
going toward why we need that house
 
03:00:41.399 --> 03:00:43.190 align:start position:0%
going toward why we need that house
resolution

03:00:43.190 --> 03:00:43.200 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
03:00:43.200 --> 03:00:44.630 align:start position:0%
resolution
um

03:00:44.630 --> 03:00:44.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:00:46.910 --> 03:00:46.920 align:start position:0%
and help me understand this it's my
 
03:00:48.889 --> 03:00:48.899 align:start position:0%
understanding that there are people in
 
03:00:51.309 --> 03:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
the courthouse that help
 
03:00:54.710 --> 03:00:54.720 align:start position:0%
people get through paperwork and they
 
03:00:56.210 --> 03:00:56.220 align:start position:0%
have support systems within the
 
03:00:56.220 --> 03:00:58.190 align:start position:0%
have support systems within the
courthouse

03:00:58.190 --> 03:00:58.200 align:start position:0%
courthouse
 
03:01:01.190 --> 03:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
um so my question is
 
03:01:03.530 --> 03:01:03.540 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be helpful for those people
 
03:01:05.870 --> 03:01:05.880 align:start position:0%
who don't have representation to have
 
03:01:07.969 --> 03:01:07.979 align:start position:0%
available to them someone who could help
 
03:01:11.090 --> 03:01:11.100 align:start position:0%
guide them in how to get evidence in or
 
03:01:14.330 --> 03:01:14.340 align:start position:0%
before they walk into the courtroom
 
03:01:15.590 --> 03:01:15.600 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question so
 
03:01:17.269 --> 03:01:17.279 align:start position:0%
there are certain types of cases
 
03:01:19.610 --> 03:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
domestic violence um some others where
 
03:01:22.490 --> 03:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
where there are folks on staff who who
 
03:01:25.790 --> 03:01:25.800 align:start position:0%
assist in in some of the work not the
 
03:01:28.130 --> 03:01:28.140 align:start position:0%
hearing process but the in the petition
 
03:01:30.769 --> 03:01:30.779 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't apply to all cases uh and
 
03:01:32.929 --> 03:01:32.939 align:start position:0%
we simply don't have resources if
 
03:01:34.490 --> 03:01:34.500 align:start position:0%
nothing else to do that
 
03:01:37.370 --> 03:01:37.380 align:start position:0%
we have to be you know as the court we
 
03:01:39.830 --> 03:01:39.840 align:start position:0%
have to be the neutral party
 
03:01:42.469 --> 03:01:42.479 align:start position:0%
um in terms of information coming to us
 
03:01:43.550 --> 03:01:43.560 align:start position:0%
we don't
 
03:01:46.429 --> 03:01:46.439 align:start position:0%
sort of help develop evidence we don't
 
03:01:49.370 --> 03:01:49.380 align:start position:0%
tell them tell parties how to give us
 
03:01:51.110 --> 03:01:51.120 align:start position:0%
information how to present evidence
 
03:01:54.170 --> 03:01:54.180 align:start position:0%
because they get to decide on their own
 
03:01:55.550 --> 03:01:55.560 align:start position:0%
how they're going to be presenting
 
03:01:57.590 --> 03:01:57.600 align:start position:0%
evidence once we get into that role of
 
03:02:00.710 --> 03:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
advocate essentially for a party we're
 
03:02:03.530 --> 03:02:03.540 align:start position:0%
no longer uh we we sort of step away
 
03:02:06.050 --> 03:02:06.060 align:start position:0%
from being a neutral body
 
03:02:08.809 --> 03:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
um you know we're as a court the parties
 
03:02:08.819 --> 03:02:10.130 align:start position:0%
um you know we're as a court the parties
are

03:02:10.130 --> 03:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
are
 
03:02:11.990 --> 03:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
come before the court to present their
 
03:02:13.730 --> 03:02:13.740 align:start position:0%
evidence and their facts and then the
 
03:02:15.170 --> 03:02:15.180 align:start position:0%
court has to make a decision and if
 
03:02:17.690 --> 03:02:17.700 align:start position:0%
we're now assisting one party to get
 
03:02:21.050 --> 03:02:21.060 align:start position:0%
their evidence in we are now sort of
 
03:02:23.450 --> 03:02:23.460 align:start position:0%
shifting that that neutrality a little
 
03:02:26.330 --> 03:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
bit attorney head wouldn't this be a
 
03:02:28.790 --> 03:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
testimony as to unfortunately it's
 
03:02:31.969 --> 03:02:31.979 align:start position:0%
expensive but this is why if you go in
 
03:02:34.370 --> 03:02:34.380 align:start position:0%
uh per se you are putting yourself
 
03:02:37.250 --> 03:02:37.260 align:start position:0%
perhaps in an advantage a disadvantage
 
03:02:39.830 --> 03:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
against someone with a lawyer
 
03:02:41.450 --> 03:02:41.460 align:start position:0%
you know I've seen a lot of pro se
 
03:02:43.790 --> 03:02:43.800 align:start position:0%
people beat lawyers too so
 
03:02:45.110 --> 03:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
um it certainly does have a lot of other
 
03:02:47.870 --> 03:02:47.880 align:start position:0%
work lawyers too would it also be a case
 
03:02:50.090 --> 03:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
where somebody could go to Legal Aid and
 
03:02:51.769 --> 03:02:51.779 align:start position:0%
say I've got a case would you take my
 
03:02:53.750 --> 03:02:53.760 align:start position:0%
case you know but certainly there are
 
03:02:53.760 --> 03:02:54.710 align:start position:0%
case you know but certainly there are

Services
 
03:02:56.150 --> 03:02:56.160 align:start position:0%
um available what resources are
 
03:02:58.490 --> 03:02:58.500 align:start position:0%
available I don't know but yes
 
03:03:01.790 --> 03:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
I think anything else folks
 
03:03:04.730 --> 03:03:04.740 align:start position:0%
it's the room deadline so I'm sorry just
 
03:03:07.969 --> 03:03:07.979 align:start position:0%
one other question if evidence how does
 
03:03:10.670 --> 03:03:10.680 align:start position:0%
this play into like requests for a gal
 
03:03:12.950 --> 03:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
to get a guardian ad litem if we were
 
03:03:15.230 --> 03:03:15.240 align:start position:0%
allowed to bring evidence in rather than
 
03:03:18.950 --> 03:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
going it does its impact that at all
 
03:03:21.769 --> 03:03:21.779 align:start position:0%
as written doesn't change the guardian
 
03:03:23.870 --> 03:03:23.880 align:start position:0%
advice process the guardian ad litem
 
03:03:27.170 --> 03:03:27.180 align:start position:0%
process is sort of a tool to to sort of
 
03:03:29.570 --> 03:03:29.580 align:start position:0%
gather evidence and present it to the
 
03:03:29.580 --> 03:03:30.710 align:start position:0%
gather evidence and present it to the
court

03:03:30.710 --> 03:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
court
 
03:03:30.720 --> 03:03:31.309 align:start position:0%
court
um

03:03:31.309 --> 03:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:03:34.610 --> 03:03:34.620 align:start position:0%
and you know it it provides sort of
 
03:03:36.410 --> 03:03:36.420 align:start position:0%
information to the court that the
 
03:03:38.210 --> 03:03:38.220 align:start position:0%
parties may have difficulty bringing to
 
03:03:40.370 --> 03:03:40.380 align:start position:0%
the to the judge so as as written at
 
03:03:42.170 --> 03:03:42.180 align:start position:0%
least this bill to my mind would not
 
03:03:44.830 --> 03:03:44.840 align:start position:0%
change the guardian Adeline process
 
03:03:47.450 --> 03:03:47.460 align:start position:0%
in terms of definition of Rules of
 
03:03:51.050 --> 03:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
Evidence does that include and the
 
03:03:53.809 --> 03:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
customary way in which the rules are
 
03:03:56.030 --> 03:03:56.040 align:start position:0%
evidenced are at the discretion of the
 
03:03:56.040 --> 03:03:57.650 align:start position:0%
evidenced are at the discretion of the
judge

03:03:57.650 --> 03:03:57.660 align:start position:0%
judge
 
03:04:02.389 --> 03:04:02.399 align:start position:0%
done there's that is discretion built
 
03:04:06.050 --> 03:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
into Rules of Evidence itself or not
 
03:04:09.530 --> 03:04:09.540 align:start position:0%
some rules yes okay so it would depend
 
03:04:10.790 --> 03:04:10.800 align:start position:0%
on the particular Rule and the
 
03:04:12.530 --> 03:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
circumstance so the Rules of Evidence
 
03:04:14.389 --> 03:04:14.399 align:start position:0%
could have built-in discretionary power
 
03:04:15.769 --> 03:04:15.779 align:start position:0%
to the judge
 
03:04:18.469 --> 03:04:18.479 align:start position:0%
some of them do okay
 
03:04:20.870 --> 03:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
so this would only change those seek to
 
03:04:23.630 --> 03:04:23.640 align:start position:0%
change those who which do not
 
03:04:26.170 --> 03:04:26.180 align:start position:0%
this would require the judge to follow
 
03:04:28.570 --> 03:04:28.580 align:start position:0%
explicitly without
 
03:04:31.370 --> 03:04:31.380 align:start position:0%
without deviating from the what's in the
 
03:04:31.380 --> 03:04:32.330 align:start position:0%
without deviating from the what's in the
rule

03:04:32.330 --> 03:04:32.340 align:start position:0%
rule
 
03:04:34.730 --> 03:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
um but but follow it explicitly so the
 
03:04:38.630 --> 03:04:38.640 align:start position:0%
rule does not contain a carve out for
 
03:04:41.269 --> 03:04:41.279 align:start position:0%
some some broader
 
03:04:42.410 --> 03:04:42.420 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
03:04:46.010 --> 03:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
discretion than no and should this be
 
03:04:48.230 --> 03:04:48.240 align:start position:0%
signed into law
 
03:04:50.510 --> 03:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
could the Judiciary then change the
 
03:04:52.490 --> 03:04:52.500 align:start position:0%
Rules of Evidence accordingly so it
 
03:04:54.889 --> 03:04:54.899 align:start position:0%
would both be in obedience to this law
 
03:04:58.010 --> 03:04:58.020 align:start position:0%
but wiser in the eyes of the Judiciary
 
03:05:00.469 --> 03:05:00.479 align:start position:0%
as to how to do it in other words could
 
03:05:04.429 --> 03:05:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:04.439 --> 03:05:05.210 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:05:05.210 --> 03:05:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:08.570 --> 03:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
that was not a suggestion it was no and
 
03:05:10.010 --> 03:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
and the problem is you know when when
 
03:05:12.110 --> 03:05:12.120 align:start position:0%
you have that that waiver sort of
 
03:05:14.450 --> 03:05:14.460 align:start position:0%
discretionary option it has a standard
 
03:05:16.429 --> 03:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
built into it also
 
03:05:18.889 --> 03:05:18.899 align:start position:0%
um so you could build more into them if
 
03:05:21.230 --> 03:05:21.240 align:start position:0%
you choose you're starting to build upon
 
03:05:24.230 --> 03:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
build when sort of the current process
 
03:05:28.190 --> 03:05:28.200 align:start position:0%
is designed for unrepresented parties
 
03:05:29.690 --> 03:05:29.700 align:start position:0%
primarily to be able to get information
 
03:05:32.510 --> 03:05:32.520 align:start position:0%
before the judge that that is making a
 
03:05:32.520 --> 03:05:33.410 align:start position:0%
before the judge that that is making a
decision

03:05:33.410 --> 03:05:33.420 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:05:35.090 --> 03:05:35.100 align:start position:0%

just testing you but you can see right
 
03:07:49.490 --> 03:07:49.500 align:start position:0%
through that we are now back to the
 
03:07:53.750 --> 03:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
original House Bill 475 and we'll take a
 
03:07:53.760 --> 03:07:58.330 align:start position:0%
original House Bill 475 and we'll take a
motion

03:07:58.330 --> 03:07:58.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:01.070 --> 03:08:01.080 align:start position:0%

representative ball thank you chairman
Pearson

03:08:02.090 --> 03:08:02.100 align:start position:0%
Pearson
 
03:08:04.429 --> 03:08:04.439 align:start position:0%
um being new at this I will have to ask
 
03:08:07.429 --> 03:08:07.439 align:start position:0%
but is it appropriate may I make an um
 
03:08:11.750 --> 03:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
a motion to retain it is appropriate
 
03:08:15.230 --> 03:08:15.240 align:start position:0%
and in fact given the testimony and uh
 
03:08:18.170 --> 03:08:18.180 align:start position:0%
we have heard it is possible that over
 
03:08:21.889 --> 03:08:21.899 align:start position:0%
the ensuing months the prime sponsor and
 
03:08:25.490 --> 03:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
others behind this could converse with
 
03:08:27.830 --> 03:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary and like with the other
 
03:08:31.010 --> 03:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
bills find ways it squares the circle so
 
03:08:33.950 --> 03:08:33.960 align:start position:0%
the motion is to retain representative
 
03:08:38.990 --> 03:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
ball any second on this representative
 
03:08:43.130 --> 03:08:43.140 align:start position:0%

03:10:10.809 --> 03:10:10.819 align:start position:0%
garnishment with child support payments
 
03:10:15.410 --> 03:10:15.420 align:start position:0%
and representatives for Lane
 
03:10:18.050 --> 03:10:18.060 align:start position:0%
um brought forth an amendment to having
 
03:10:22.790 --> 03:10:22.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:25.190 --> 03:10:25.200 align:start position:0%
and we'll see if the amendment
 
03:10:25.200 --> 03:10:26.389 align:start position:0%
and we'll see if the amendment
um

03:10:26.389 --> 03:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:10:32.870 --> 03:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:32.880 --> 03:10:41.269 align:start position:0%
 
oh

03:10:41.269 --> 03:10:41.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:43.849 --> 03:10:43.859 align:start position:0%
and I will present the amendment as a
 
03:10:48.530 --> 03:10:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:51.190 --> 03:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
and when you have it all I can point out
 
03:10:56.929 --> 03:10:56.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:00.469 --> 03:11:00.479 align:start position:0%
if you get out the original Bill 618 FN
 
03:11:02.690 --> 03:11:02.700 align:start position:0%
and do side by side with the amendment
 
03:11:19.670 --> 03:11:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:19.680 --> 03:11:24.410 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:11:24.410 --> 03:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:26.510 --> 03:11:26.520 align:start position:0%
if you look down on the original Bill
 
03:11:28.550 --> 03:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
near the bottom you will see in
 
03:11:32.389 --> 03:11:32.399 align:start position:0%
parentheses the number four and it says
 
03:11:35.630 --> 03:11:35.640 align:start position:0%
when an average period amounting to the
 
03:11:38.210 --> 03:11:38.220 align:start position:0%
support owed for two months or more has
 
03:11:41.150 --> 03:11:41.160 align:start position:0%
accrued we were told in the hearing that
 
03:11:44.090 --> 03:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
the federal standard is 30 days so on
 
03:11:51.830 --> 03:11:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:55.730 --> 03:11:55.740 align:start position:0%
on the original Bill parentheses 5 if
 
03:11:58.910 --> 03:11:58.920 align:start position:0%
the obliger resides out of state
 
03:12:02.450 --> 03:12:02.460 align:start position:0%
we suggested that be removed you will
 
03:12:05.809 --> 03:12:05.819 align:start position:0%
not see that in the amendment
 
03:12:08.630 --> 03:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
item on the original Bill the next one
 
03:12:11.269 --> 03:12:11.279 align:start position:0%
six a court has imposed a protective
 
03:12:13.910 --> 03:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
order that is in effect and related to
 
03:12:17.330 --> 03:12:17.340 align:start position:0%
the order of support people ask for that
 
03:12:22.010 --> 03:12:22.020 align:start position:0%
to be removed as well and it is so
 
03:12:23.870 --> 03:12:23.880 align:start position:0%
pretty much
 
03:12:27.290 --> 03:12:27.300 align:start position:0%
everything that
 
03:12:29.389 --> 03:12:29.399 align:start position:0%
um I think I remember was asked for in
 
03:12:31.370 --> 03:12:31.380 align:start position:0%
the hearing is addressed in the
 
03:12:34.550 --> 03:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
amendment so the amendment if it passes
 
03:12:41.389 --> 03:12:41.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:43.250 --> 03:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative long
 
03:12:45.530 --> 03:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I know the other
 
03:12:49.250 --> 03:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
note I took was with respect to uh
 
03:12:52.670 --> 03:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
uh 21 on the original where the court
 
03:12:56.150 --> 03:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
system uh where the Division of Child
 
03:12:58.370 --> 03:12:58.380 align:start position:0%
Support Services shall make the standard
 
03:12:58.380 --> 03:12:59.690 align:start position:0%
Support Services shall make the standard
form

03:12:59.690 --> 03:12:59.700 align:start position:0%
form
 
03:13:02.330 --> 03:13:02.340 align:start position:0%
and I believe the testimony was that
 
03:13:04.490 --> 03:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
historically it's the court system that
 
03:13:10.610 --> 03:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:12.469 --> 03:13:12.479 align:start position:0%
okay I don't recall that I'm not saying
 
03:13:13.790 --> 03:13:13.800 align:start position:0%
you're wrong I'm just saying I don't
 
03:13:21.830 --> 03:13:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:24.530 --> 03:13:24.540 align:start position:0%
is that all right yeah I do some child
 
03:13:26.210 --> 03:13:26.220 align:start position:0%
support here so I
 
03:13:28.730 --> 03:13:28.740 align:start position:0%
is that child support or am I right now
 
03:13:46.130 --> 03:13:46.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:49.130 --> 03:13:49.140 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman yes uh we did
 
03:13:51.469 --> 03:13:51.479 align:start position:0%
testify uh the mural child support my
 
03:13:54.130 --> 03:13:54.140 align:start position:0%
name is attorney Matthew Hayes uh myself
 
03:13:56.450 --> 03:13:56.460 align:start position:0%
and the director of Child Support
 
03:13:59.389 --> 03:13:59.399 align:start position:0%
testified on this bill a few weeks ago
 
03:14:02.750 --> 03:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
uh one of our concerns was this form
 
03:14:05.690 --> 03:14:05.700 align:start position:0%
that the murals for being asked to
 
03:14:09.530 --> 03:14:09.540 align:start position:0%
create uh generally the mural
 
03:14:11.570 --> 03:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
would probably not create a form like
 
03:14:13.730 --> 03:14:13.740 align:start position:0%
this because every case is so different
 
03:14:15.530 --> 03:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
from one another
 
03:14:17.570 --> 03:14:17.580 align:start position:0%
um it's not something I think that we'd
 
03:14:19.370 --> 03:14:19.380 align:start position:0%
be able to create that would meet every
 
03:14:19.380 --> 03:14:20.750 align:start position:0%
be able to create that would meet every
contingency

03:14:20.750 --> 03:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
contingency
 
03:14:22.370 --> 03:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
um to go to representative Long's point
 
03:14:24.349 --> 03:14:24.359 align:start position:0%
I think we sent something along those
 
03:14:24.359 --> 03:14:25.969 align:start position:0%
I think we sent something along those
lines

03:14:25.969 --> 03:14:25.979 align:start position:0%
lines
 
03:14:25.979 --> 03:14:27.110 align:start position:0%
lines
um

03:14:27.110 --> 03:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:30.110 --> 03:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
if I if I recall the bill
 
03:14:32.210 --> 03:14:32.220 align:start position:0%
knew the provisions that would be
 
03:14:34.130 --> 03:14:34.140 align:start position:0%
requested to be in that form are already
 
03:14:36.110 --> 03:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
in the uniform support order
 
03:14:38.570 --> 03:14:38.580 align:start position:0%
in one form or another and then some of
 
03:14:40.190 --> 03:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
the other provisions
 
03:14:42.590 --> 03:14:42.600 align:start position:0%
with respect to
 
03:14:46.309 --> 03:14:46.319 align:start position:0%
to whom uh non-payment is reported
 
03:14:47.990 --> 03:14:48.000 align:start position:0%
um I think that was one of the issues
 
03:14:49.670 --> 03:14:49.680 align:start position:0%
something like that's not in the uniform
 
03:14:53.269 --> 03:14:53.279 align:start position:0%
support order standing orders however if
 
03:14:55.910 --> 03:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
we're not involved in the case I don't
 
03:14:57.170 --> 03:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
think that we would be able to provide
 
03:14:59.290 --> 03:14:59.300 align:start position:0%
anybody with that type of information
 
03:15:02.929 --> 03:15:02.939 align:start position:0%
we're only involved in cases where
 
03:15:05.929 --> 03:15:05.939 align:start position:0%
certain benefits are being provided or
 
03:15:08.929 --> 03:15:08.939 align:start position:0%
I've already applies for our services I
 
03:15:12.010 --> 03:15:12.020 align:start position:0%
do recall testifying that many cases
 
03:15:13.790 --> 03:15:13.800 align:start position:0%
that are
 
03:15:16.070 --> 03:15:16.080 align:start position:0%
many child support cases I'm going to
 
03:15:18.710 --> 03:15:18.720 align:start position:0%
interrupt you right now because this is
 
03:15:20.630 --> 03:15:20.640 align:start position:0%
not in the amendment that whole thing
 
03:15:23.450 --> 03:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
about DHHS child support should
 
03:15:26.809 --> 03:15:26.819 align:start position:0%
establish a form is not in the amendment
 
03:15:28.730 --> 03:15:28.740 align:start position:0%
uh well I don't have an amendment in
 
03:15:35.510 --> 03:15:35.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:39.170 --> 03:15:39.180 align:start position:0%
I beg your pardon sir you may continue
 
03:15:40.910 --> 03:15:40.920 align:start position:0%
well I don't want to go on too long I
 
03:15:42.170 --> 03:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
know the committee I respect the
 
03:15:44.330 --> 03:15:44.340 align:start position:0%
committee's time I mean I suppose
 
03:15:46.790 --> 03:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
um our position is that we wouldn't feel
 
03:15:49.429 --> 03:15:49.439 align:start position:0%
like we're the best party to establish a
 
03:15:51.830 --> 03:15:51.840 align:start position:0%
form like that although I understand
 
03:15:55.070 --> 03:15:55.080 align:start position:0%
more information uh you know if it's a
 
03:15:56.990 --> 03:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
matter of working with the judicial
 
03:15:59.929 --> 03:15:59.939 align:start position:0%
branch to help them streamline whatever
 
03:16:02.389 --> 03:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
information they do provide there's ways
 
03:16:04.190 --> 03:16:04.200 align:start position:0%
I think and and certainly providing
 
03:16:06.590 --> 03:16:06.600 align:start position:0%
parties with more information about our
 
03:16:09.769 --> 03:16:09.779 align:start position:0%
process if the choose to use our process
 
03:16:12.050 --> 03:16:12.060 align:start position:0%
I don't see anything wrong with that but
 
03:16:14.090 --> 03:16:14.100 align:start position:0%
as far as a standard form
 
03:16:15.889 --> 03:16:15.899 align:start position:0%
I don't know if that is something we
 
03:16:18.110 --> 03:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
might be able to address
 
03:16:21.250 --> 03:16:21.260 align:start position:0%
um have you take any questions or
 
03:16:23.330 --> 03:16:23.340 align:start position:0%
provide my information in case there's
 
03:16:27.410 --> 03:16:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:29.510 --> 03:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
should the bill pass and you're asked to
 
03:16:31.849 --> 03:16:31.859 align:start position:0%
do this I'm hearing you say there's a
 
03:16:35.210 --> 03:16:35.220 align:start position:0%
workaround on that DHHS develops a form
 
03:16:37.910 --> 03:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
which means you Outsource it to the
 
03:16:40.910 --> 03:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
Judiciary who is more directly involved
 
03:16:43.370 --> 03:16:43.380 align:start position:0%
and you're happy with that
 
03:16:46.910 --> 03:16:46.920 align:start position:0%
um or am I reading something in
 
03:16:49.130 --> 03:16:49.140 align:start position:0%
I don't know if our positions we would
 
03:16:50.510 --> 03:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
think it's something that would be in a
 
03:16:53.630 --> 03:16:53.640 align:start position:0%
statute but uh you know it's a policy
 
03:16:56.630 --> 03:16:56.640 align:start position:0%
decision if the legislature asks us to
 
03:16:58.849 --> 03:16:58.859 align:start position:0%
do something we can certainly try to
 
03:17:00.650 --> 03:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
work with the judicial branch the
 
03:17:03.349 --> 03:17:03.359 align:start position:0%
problem is it's just that
 
03:17:06.530 --> 03:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
we don't we're only authorized to deal
 
03:17:09.290 --> 03:17:09.300 align:start position:0%
with certain cases and we don't deal
 
03:17:11.809 --> 03:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
with divorce cases I I we don't attend
 
03:17:15.290 --> 03:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
final hearings we don't go to we are not
 
03:17:17.210 --> 03:17:17.220 align:start position:0%
authorized to appear in Parental actions
 
03:17:17.220 --> 03:17:18.590 align:start position:0%
authorized to appear in Parental actions
it's

03:17:18.590 --> 03:17:18.600 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:17:22.910 --> 03:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
merely child support hearings unless you
 
03:17:24.230 --> 03:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
know if there's a child support case
 
03:17:26.210 --> 03:17:26.220 align:start position:0%
that's open with our Bureau then we're
 
03:17:27.830 --> 03:17:27.840 align:start position:0%
allowed you know we're certainly able to
 
03:17:29.630 --> 03:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
answer parties questions so we go to the
 
03:17:32.090 --> 03:17:32.100 align:start position:0%
hearings if we need to but
 
03:17:33.170 --> 03:17:33.180 align:start position:0%
um I I just don't know if we're
 
03:17:36.170 --> 03:17:36.180 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a blanket form
 
03:17:36.180 --> 03:17:37.849 align:start position:0%
comfortable with a blanket form
um

03:17:37.849 --> 03:17:37.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
just slips outside the scope of what
 
03:17:42.230 --> 03:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
we're authorized to do
 
03:17:44.030 --> 03:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
and yet if this bill passes you are
 
03:17:45.710 --> 03:17:45.720 align:start position:0%
authorized to do it now
 
03:17:48.110 --> 03:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
well to the extent that we're authorized
 
03:17:48.120 --> 03:17:49.010 align:start position:0%
well to the extent that we're authorized
in

03:17:49.010 --> 03:17:49.020 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:17:50.809 --> 03:17:50.819 align:start position:0%
under their title 40 in the Social
 
03:17:55.250 --> 03:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:57.650 --> 03:17:57.660 align:start position:0%
I should think that authorization to do
 
03:17:59.870 --> 03:17:59.880 align:start position:0%
something is more determined by the law
 
03:18:03.349 --> 03:18:03.359 align:start position:0%
that these State puts into effect than
 
03:18:06.290 --> 03:18:06.300 align:start position:0%
any departmental procedures I think the
 
03:18:08.929 --> 03:18:08.939 align:start position:0%
problem is is really as I said two of
 
03:18:10.490 --> 03:18:10.500 align:start position:0%
the pieces are already in the uniform
 
03:18:12.650 --> 03:18:12.660 align:start position:0%
support order okay and then you get the
 
03:18:14.570 --> 03:18:14.580 align:start position:0%
piece that says you know we're supposed
 
03:18:17.269 --> 03:18:17.279 align:start position:0%
to develop a form that says if you're
 
03:18:19.130 --> 03:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
not getting payment this is what you
 
03:18:21.950 --> 03:18:21.960 align:start position:0%
should do we wouldn't know in every case
 
03:18:23.929 --> 03:18:23.939 align:start position:0%
what that person should do if they're
 
03:18:25.370 --> 03:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
not using our services we don't know
 
03:18:27.410 --> 03:18:27.420 align:start position:0%
anything about their case Okay
 
03:18:29.090 --> 03:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
um you know that should be something
 
03:18:30.530 --> 03:18:30.540 align:start position:0%
that should be left up to their attorney
 
03:18:33.110 --> 03:18:33.120 align:start position:0%
to help them with or or the court can
 
03:18:35.510 --> 03:18:35.520 align:start position:0%
say when they're issuing the uniform
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
support order
 
03:18:39.230 --> 03:18:39.240 align:start position:0%
this is payable through direct payments
 
03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:41.520 align:start position:0%
to the parties not the bureau child
 
03:18:44.330 --> 03:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
support if this person doesn't pay you
 
03:18:47.389 --> 03:18:47.399 align:start position:0%
final emotional contempt or bring them
 
03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
back for a payment hearing uh
 
03:18:52.730 --> 03:18:52.740 align:start position:0%

03:18:57.950 --> 03:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
I have not moved this I simply
 
03:19:00.110 --> 03:19:00.120 align:start position:0%
introduced it so we could look at it
 
03:19:03.290 --> 03:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
could I have a sense of the room about
 
03:19:06.590 --> 03:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
whether you like the amendment or not
 
03:19:11.090 --> 03:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:17.030 --> 03:19:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:20.090 --> 03:19:20.100 align:start position:0%
then I will not move the amendment
 
03:19:28.010 --> 03:19:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:30.950 --> 03:19:30.960 align:start position:0%
and the chair will entertain
 
03:19:30.960 --> 03:19:38.570 align:start position:0%

emotion

03:19:38.570 --> 03:19:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:42.230 --> 03:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
I'll make a motion to retain uh House
 
03:19:45.710 --> 03:19:45.720 align:start position:0%
Bill 618 please representative D Simone
 
03:19:48.830 --> 03:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
moves to retain seconded by and there's
 
03:19:51.309 --> 03:19:51.319 align:start position:0%
no blurb involved no writing
 
03:19:56.809 --> 03:19:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:58.730 --> 03:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
could I say this is the short and the
 
03:20:02.330 --> 03:20:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:05.090 --> 03:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
this will give us a chance to deal with
 
03:20:07.370 --> 03:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
this question and I hope the supporters
 
03:20:10.250 --> 03:20:10.260 align:start position:0%
of this representative Edwards being one
 
03:20:12.230 --> 03:20:12.240 align:start position:0%
of them representative D Simone being
 
03:20:14.510 --> 03:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
another and and all kinds of good folks
 
03:20:17.510 --> 03:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
can deal with these little issues to
 
03:20:20.210 --> 03:20:20.220 align:start position:0%
make this this is an important bill
 
03:20:22.010 --> 03:20:22.020 align:start position:0%
to to kill
 
03:20:25.070 --> 03:20:25.080 align:start position:0%
so retaining I believe is the right
 
03:20:26.570 --> 03:20:26.580 align:start position:0%
motion anybody wish to speak to the
 
03:20:28.610 --> 03:20:28.620 align:start position:0%

state that uh I second your statement
 
03:20:38.269 --> 03:20:38.279 align:start position:0%
that it's a very important bill it needs
 
03:20:41.510 --> 03:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
to be worked on and that's why I made
 
03:20:43.670 --> 03:20:43.680 align:start position:0%
the motion
 
03:20:46.010 --> 03:20:46.020 align:start position:0%

03:24:43.739 --> 03:24:45.950 align:start position:0%
this is House Bill 499 the amendment is
619.

03:24:45.950 --> 03:24:45.960 align:start position:0%
619.
 
03:24:47.690 --> 03:24:47.700 align:start position:0%
and we have been handed it out
 
03:24:47.700 --> 03:24:53.690 align:start position:0%
and we have been handed it out
previously

03:24:53.690 --> 03:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:55.550 --> 03:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:24:58.010 --> 03:24:58.020 align:start position:0%
the operative part of the amendment is
 
03:25:00.469 --> 03:25:00.479 align:start position:0%
line 14 of it if the judge has reason to
 
03:25:02.389 --> 03:25:02.399 align:start position:0%
believe that applying the Rules of
 
03:25:04.729 --> 03:25:04.739 align:start position:0%
Evidence shall adversely affect the case
 
03:25:06.889 --> 03:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
the judge May waive the Rules of
 
03:25:09.290 --> 03:25:09.300 align:start position:0%
Evidence with the kind of statement
 
03:25:12.229 --> 03:25:12.239 align:start position:0%
above otherwise you don't
 
03:25:12.239 --> 03:25:13.610 align:start position:0%
above otherwise you don't
um

03:25:13.610 --> 03:25:13.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:19.309 --> 03:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:21.410 --> 03:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
were you just waving
 
03:25:22.969 --> 03:25:22.979 align:start position:0%
you weren't even waving you were just
 
03:25:25.190 --> 03:25:25.200 align:start position:0%
gesture it you were talking hanging out
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
hanging out with your peeps okay got it
 
03:25:30.170 --> 03:25:30.180 align:start position:0%
all right
 
03:25:33.349 --> 03:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
um my opinion is that this is saddon
 
03:25:35.210 --> 03:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
close to what we've just retained that
 
03:25:37.190 --> 03:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
we can retain this at the same time what
 
03:25:38.090 --> 03:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
do you think
 
03:25:49.790 --> 03:25:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:53.450 --> 03:25:53.460 align:start position:0%
well what representative Nelson
 
03:25:55.370 --> 03:25:55.380 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
03:25:57.710 --> 03:25:57.720 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to do that with haste
 
03:25:57.720 --> 03:25:58.610 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to do that with haste
though

03:25:58.610 --> 03:25:58.620 align:start position:0%
though
 
03:26:01.130 --> 03:26:01.140 align:start position:0%
um so we can if we retain both of them
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
we could then study the wording and
 
03:26:06.590 --> 03:26:06.600 align:start position:0%
verbiage of each and also too remember
 
03:26:09.410 --> 03:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
we're going to have that um orientation
 
03:26:13.490 --> 03:26:13.500 align:start position:0%

03:26:18.469 --> 03:26:18.479 align:start position:0%
that retaining might be
 
03:26:21.769 --> 03:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
um more beneficial I I have seen in a
 
03:26:24.410 --> 03:26:24.420 align:start position:0%
retained session two bills brought up
 
03:26:26.229 --> 03:26:26.239 align:start position:0%
