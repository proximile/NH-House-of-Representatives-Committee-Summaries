both items will need waivers for gel car

you need a motion to postpone and Grant
 
00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:22.139 align:start position:0%
waivers we'll move second
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%

yes sir um
 
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:42.660 align:start position:0%
let's see so this proposal is
 
00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:45.319 align:start position:0%
implementing the One Touch Make Ready
 
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
program which is a requirement of the
 
00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 align:start position:0%
FCC there are a number of legislative
 
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
intent and some clarity comments and
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
there's also a recommendation regarding
 
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
doing some legislation to fix some
 
00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:05.340 align:start position:0%
issues between the puc and the
 
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
department relative to their rulemaking
 
00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:08.770 align:start position:0%
department relative to their rulemaking
Authority

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:08.780 align:start position:0%
Authority
 
00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
but they have filed a conditional
 
00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:14.940 align:start position:0%
approval and that has been received and
 
00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:17.400 align:start position:0%
a waiver as well my apologies but
 
00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 align:start position:0%
there's no F there's no FP memo on the
 
00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:23.759 align:start position:0%
website if you're looking for one just
 
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:27.539 align:start position:0%
to summarize there are some issues with
 
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
some ambiguous terms pursuant to 541a1
 
00:07:34.189 --> 00:07:34.199 align:start position:0%
rules must Implement interpret or make
 
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:37.560 align:start position:0%
specific a statute and there are several
 
00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:39.720 align:start position:0%
places in this proposal in which there
 
00:07:42.529 --> 00:07:42.539 align:start position:0%
are some ambiguous U.S terms that are
 
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:45.300 align:start position:0%
used but they are not defined these
 
00:07:48.249 --> 00:07:48.259 align:start position:0%
terms are just reasonable
 
00:07:50.809 --> 00:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory and the phrase good
 
00:07:53.150 --> 00:07:53.160 align:start position:0%
and sufficient cause
 
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:55.340 align:start position:0%
if you note the agency's cover letter
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
indicates that one particular section of
 
00:08:01.809 --> 00:08:01.819 align:start position:0%
the rule I think that was
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
1303.13 is meant to implement
 
00:08:12.529 --> 00:08:12.539 align:start position:0%
47 cfr1 and like I said that's an FCC a
 
00:08:15.469 --> 00:08:15.479 align:start position:0%
federal program the agency thinks that
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
SB 88 from last session created a carve
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
out but the statue clearly directs the
 
00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080 align:start position:0%
agency to adopt the fcc's rules as the
 
00:08:28.309 --> 00:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
FCC has adopted them but it also directs
 
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
the agency to do so via the 541a it
 
00:08:35.269 --> 00:08:35.279 align:start position:0%
doesn't explicitly carve out the rules
 
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
from the requirements of 541a so it's
 
00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:40.620 align:start position:0%
not clear whether or not that was
 
00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:43.620 align:start position:0%
intended to be an exemption but um the
 
00:08:45.949 --> 00:08:45.959 align:start position:0%
agency has noted that it's difficult to
 
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
comply with both 541a and the fcc's
 
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:51.980 align:start position:0%
rules and
 
00:08:55.070 --> 00:08:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a high level summary if
 
00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:57.180 align:start position:0%
you will of what's going on with the
 
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:00.300 align:start position:0%
proposal if you look the first set of
 
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:01.430 align:start position:0%
proposal if you look the first set of
comments

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:01.440 align:start position:0%
comments
 
00:09:05.509 --> 00:09:05.519 align:start position:0%
are on page two of the linked PDF down
 
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:07.560 align:start position:0%
at the bottom of the page
 
00:09:10.970 --> 00:09:10.980 align:start position:0%
and again this is around this phrase or
 
00:09:12.949 --> 00:09:12.959 align:start position:0%
these sets of terms called just
 
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:15.660 align:start position:0%
reasonable and non-discriminatory so a
 
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:19.380 align:start position:0%
poll owner is supposed to to provide
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
terms of attachment that are just
 
00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:23.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable and non-discriminatory but
 
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
the agency hasn't defined those there's
 
00:09:27.829 --> 00:09:27.839 align:start position:0%
no broad criteria to know what that
 
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:29.700 align:start position:0%
means and that can lead to arbitrary
 
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
decision making so
 
00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:36.660 align:start position:0%
um the the agency has noted that
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
everyone you know the stakeholders and
 
00:09:41.090 --> 00:09:41.100 align:start position:0%
and all know what this what these terms
 
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:44.580 align:start position:0%
mean but they still haven't defined them
 
00:09:47.030 --> 00:09:47.040 align:start position:0%
um I think the next comment is on the
 
00:09:48.650 --> 00:09:48.660 align:start position:0%
next set of count comments are on page
 
00:09:51.829 --> 00:09:51.839 align:start position:0%
seven and eight and this pretty much is
 
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:54.540 align:start position:0%
the same sort of comment the rule again
 
00:09:56.449 --> 00:09:56.459 align:start position:0%
is saying that during the performance of
 
00:09:59.690 --> 00:09:59.700 align:start position:0%
Make Ready work for good and sufficient
 
00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:02.519 align:start position:0%
cause but it doesn't talk about what
 
00:10:03.889 --> 00:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
that means
 
00:10:06.949 --> 00:10:06.959 align:start position:0%
the same issue on page eight where
 
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:09.240 align:start position:0%
they're using the terms reasonable
 
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:12.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity and non-discriminatory basis
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
again we don't really know what that
 
00:10:16.009 --> 00:10:16.019 align:start position:0%
means if someone's supposed to have a
 
00:10:19.430 --> 00:10:19.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable opportunity is that one is
 
00:10:21.530 --> 00:10:21.540 align:start position:0%
that one day is that five days we don't
 
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:23.700 align:start position:0%
know what that means
 
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
um on the bottom of that page as well
 
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
you'll see that's on the bottom of page
 
00:10:30.769 --> 00:10:30.779 align:start position:0%
8 of the linked PDF there's a large
 
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:33.720 align:start position:0%
comment box letting you know that
 
00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:36.120 align:start position:0%
section 13 of the rule for the One Touch
 
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:39.740 align:start position:0%
Make Ready program that is meant to be
 
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:43.200 align:start position:0%
implementing that Federal Regulation and
 
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
like I said earlier the agency thinks
 
00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:48.360 align:start position:0%
that it SB 88 created a car about but it
 
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:52.320 align:start position:0%
the language doesn't state that it says
 
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:55.040 align:start position:0%
that department shall under rules under
 
00:10:57.949 --> 00:10:57.959 align:start position:0%
541a implement the provisions of One
 
00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:00.240 align:start position:0%
Touch make ready as adopted by the
 
00:11:02.509 --> 00:11:02.519 align:start position:0%
Federal Communications Commission
 
00:11:03.889 --> 00:11:03.899 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say that they're
 
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:05.940 align:start position:0%
explicitly carved out from the
 
00:11:08.389 --> 00:11:08.399 align:start position:0%
requirements of 541a
 
00:11:10.069 --> 00:11:10.079 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:11.820 align:start position:0%
and like I said earlier the agency has
 
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:13.920 align:start position:0%
indicated that it cannot comply with
 
00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:14.889 align:start position:0%
indicated that it cannot comply with
both

00:11:14.889 --> 00:11:14.899 align:start position:0%
both
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
same common is essentially on page 10 or
 
00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:21.060 align:start position:0%
where the rule is using reasonable
 
00:11:24.530 --> 00:11:24.540 align:start position:0%
opportunity or reasonably likely but
 
00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:26.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't Define what the term reasonably
 
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:28.190 align:start position:0%
doesn't Define what the term reasonably
means

00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:28.200 align:start position:0%
means
 
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:30.600 align:start position:0%
the last comment is is a very large
 
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:33.540 align:start position:0%
comment on page 11 of The Proposal
 
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
and um here we know that there's some
 
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:38.940 align:start position:0%
need to clarify the rule making
 
00:11:41.509 --> 00:11:41.519 align:start position:0%
Authority and the jurisdictional Divide
 
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
between the puc and the department of
 
00:11:43.620 --> 00:11:44.509 align:start position:0%
between the puc and the department of
energy

00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
energy
 
00:11:47.389 --> 00:11:47.399 align:start position:0%
you may be aware that house bill 2 from
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
the budget bill from 2021 established
 
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:52.040 align:start position:0%
the department of energy and transferred
 
00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:55.500 align:start position:0%
the puc's functions powers and duties to
 
00:11:57.730 --> 00:11:57.740 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy specifically
 
00:11:59.829 --> 00:11:59.839 align:start position:0%
RSA 12
 
00:12:02.569 --> 00:12:02.579 align:start position:0%
P11 stated that all of the functions
 
00:12:04.670 --> 00:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
Powers duties records personnel and
 
00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:07.260 align:start position:0%
property of the puc is replaced with the
 
00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:09.720 align:start position:0%
authority of the Department of energy as
 
00:12:12.230 --> 00:12:12.240 align:start position:0%
of July 1st 2021
 
00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560 align:start position:0%
and RSA 363 one states that the puc is
 
00:12:18.530 --> 00:12:18.540 align:start position:0%
an independent agency administratively
 
00:12:20.690 --> 00:12:20.700 align:start position:0%
attached to the Department of energy
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 21g10
 
00:12:27.170 --> 00:12:27.180 align:start position:0%
and so the chair of the puc still has
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
some Powers set fourth in 21 G9 but 21
 
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320 align:start position:0%
G9 authorizes a commissioner of an
 
00:12:38.810 --> 00:12:38.820 align:start position:0%
agency to adopt rules of an agency so it
 
00:12:41.509 --> 00:12:41.519 align:start position:0%
looks like that the puc chair still has
 
00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:44.360 align:start position:0%
rule making Authority and we're not sure
 
00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:46.620 align:start position:0%
what the extent of that rule-making
 
00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:49.320 align:start position:0%
Authority is we don't know where the
 
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.180 align:start position:0%
line is between the department of energy
 
00:12:54.650 --> 00:12:54.660 align:start position:0%
and the puc so again this comment is
 
00:12:56.930 --> 00:12:56.940 align:start position:0%
here to to summarize some of the issues
 
00:12:58.670 --> 00:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
that we're seeing and that you may want
 
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:00.600 align:start position:0%
to consider some legislation to address
 
00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:01.750 align:start position:0%
to consider some legislation to address
that

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:04.800 align:start position:0%
regardless the department interprets the
 
00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:07.200 align:start position:0%
statute to only authorize the puc to
 
00:13:09.949 --> 00:13:09.959 align:start position:0%
regulate and enforce rates charges terms
 
00:13:12.230 --> 00:13:12.240 align:start position:0%
and conditions of poll attachments and
 
00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:14.700 align:start position:0%
to hear and resolve complaints and so
 
00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:17.160 align:start position:0%
while there may be some you know some
 
00:13:19.190 --> 00:13:19.200 align:start position:0%
lack of clarity where the jurisdiction
 
00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:21.620 align:start position:0%
exactly lies
 
00:13:23.690 --> 00:13:23.700 align:start position:0%
it does appear that they do have
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
authority to go ahead and move forward
 
00:13:27.530 --> 00:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
with this proposal
 
00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:30.540 align:start position:0%
so that summarizes the the issues with
 
00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:34.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.690 --> 00:13:37.700 align:start position:0%
we have a request for
 
00:13:46.190 --> 00:13:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:48.530 --> 00:13:48.540 align:start position:0%
I don't know what you can say to polish
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:55.320 align:start position:0%
thank you Senator Reagan and members of
 
00:13:57.470 --> 00:13:57.480 align:start position:0%

00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
the law firm of Oren Reno and I
 
00:14:02.629 --> 00:14:02.639 align:start position:0%
represent the New England connectivity
 
00:14:05.030 --> 00:14:05.040 align:start position:0%

necta
 
00:14:08.389 --> 00:14:08.399 align:start position:0%
necta has submitted a letter this
 
00:14:12.110 --> 00:14:12.120 align:start position:0%
morning in support of the letter that
 
00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:14.519 align:start position:0%
was submitted by the department of
 
00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
energy which seeks conditional approval
 
00:14:21.889 --> 00:14:21.899 align:start position:0%
of the final proposal of the poll
 
00:14:25.009 --> 00:14:25.019 align:start position:0%
attachment rules as indicated in our
 
00:14:27.490 --> 00:14:27.500 align:start position:0%
letter we think that the the information
 
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
presented in commissioner chicoine's
 
00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.150 align:start position:0%
presented in commissioner chicoine's
letter

00:14:31.150 --> 00:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
letter
 
00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:34.680 align:start position:0%
outlining the reasons why the
 
00:14:39.009 --> 00:14:39.019 align:start position:0%
um the statutory Authority that Doe has
 
00:14:42.949 --> 00:14:42.959 align:start position:0%
allows it to maintain the wording of the
 
00:14:44.389 --> 00:14:44.399 align:start position:0%
rules that it has submitted is
 
00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:47.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate and I'd be happy to answer
 
00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:48.660 align:start position:0%
any other questions that the committee
 
00:14:50.509 --> 00:14:50.519 align:start position:0%
might have
 
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
I'd also defer to attorney Wiesner who I
 
00:14:55.810 --> 00:14:55.820 align:start position:0%
believe is going to speak to this issue
 
00:14:59.629 --> 00:14:59.639 align:start position:0%
he represents the department of energy
 
00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:03.180 align:start position:0%
okay so we'll hear from him to find out
 
00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:05.820 align:start position:0%
why there's so many comments on these
 
00:15:05.820 --> 00:15:08.329 align:start position:0%
why there's so many comments on these
rules

00:15:08.329 --> 00:15:08.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:09.829 --> 00:15:09.839 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:24.540 align:start position:0%
good morning uh Mr chair
 
00:15:25.790 --> 00:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
um Madam Vice chair members of the
 
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:27.720 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Chris Elms I'm the
 
00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:28.980 align:start position:0%
Deputy Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
00:15:30.530 --> 00:15:30.540 align:start position:0%
Department of energy and I'm joined by
 
00:15:32.509 --> 00:15:32.519 align:start position:0%
attorney David Wiesner who's the legal
 
00:15:34.430 --> 00:15:34.440 align:start position:0%
director for the Department
 
00:15:36.050 --> 00:15:36.060 align:start position:0%
um the final proposal and conditional
 
00:15:38.269 --> 00:15:38.279 align:start position:0%
approval request before you today are a
 
00:15:40.370 --> 00:15:40.380 align:start position:0%
result of the Department's work to
 
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
reflect the restructuring that occurred
 
00:15:43.970 --> 00:15:43.980 align:start position:0%
with the creation of the department uh
 
00:15:46.610 --> 00:15:46.620 align:start position:0%
in hb2 last year
 
00:15:48.889 --> 00:15:48.899 align:start position:0%
um this includes transferring many
 
00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:50.940 align:start position:0%
functions from the puc to the department
 
00:15:52.730 --> 00:15:52.740 align:start position:0%
including the rulemaking for utility
 
00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:55.440 align:start position:0%
pole attachments we have made only
 
00:15:57.470 --> 00:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
minimal changes to most of the existing
 
00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
puc 1300 rules
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
um that will now be the utility pole
 
00:16:05.509 --> 00:16:05.519 align:start position:0%
attachment rules of the department uh
 
00:16:07.129 --> 00:16:07.139 align:start position:0%
the new Department of energy rules are
 
00:16:08.810 --> 00:16:08.820 align:start position:0%
also intended to implement Senate Bill
 
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:10.860 align:start position:0%
88 which had many Provisions dealing
 
00:16:13.129 --> 00:16:13.139 align:start position:0%
with Broadband expansion in that
 
00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
legislation the general court directed
 
00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:16.680 align:start position:0%
the department to adopt Federal
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
Communications commissions okay so what
 
00:16:19.910 --> 00:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
are we going to do about all the
 
00:16:22.610 --> 00:16:22.620 align:start position:0%
comments that about the vague words that
 
00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:24.660 align:start position:0%
you've already known about and haven't
 
00:16:26.389 --> 00:16:26.399 align:start position:0%
done anything about it in the
 
00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:28.260 align:start position:0%
formulation of the rules I will let
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
attorney Wiesner respond to that
 
00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:32.150 align:start position:0%
attorney Wiesner respond to that
foreign

00:16:32.150 --> 00:16:32.160 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
thank you excuse me for the record I'm
 
00:16:36.230 --> 00:16:36.240 align:start position:0%
David Wiesner I'm the legal director
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
with the Department of energy uh and I
 
00:16:41.509 --> 00:16:41.519 align:start position:0%
will address those issues so earlier
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
this week we filed a conditional
 
00:16:44.870 --> 00:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
approval request we addressed the
 
00:16:47.629 --> 00:16:47.639 align:start position:0%
editorial and formatting changes that
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
were noted by OLS comments we declined
 
00:16:53.090 --> 00:16:53.100 align:start position:0%
to make language changes uh in
 
00:16:55.970 --> 00:16:55.980 align:start position:0%
particular with the uh the language
 
00:16:58.670 --> 00:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
which has been called into question by
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
the OLS comments again as Deputy
 
00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
Commissioner Elms mentioned our intent
 
00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:06.900 align:start position:0%
here was to make minimal changes to the
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
puc 1300 rules which are effectively
 
00:17:11.390 --> 00:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
being brought over to the Department of
 
00:17:13.429 --> 00:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
energy in connection with this
 
00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:17.520 align:start position:0%
rulemaking and other than that change of
 
00:17:19.789 --> 00:17:19.799 align:start position:0%
name if you will from one agency to
 
00:17:22.789 --> 00:17:22.799 align:start position:0%
another our Focus was on implementation
 
00:17:26.390 --> 00:17:26.400 align:start position:0%
of Senate Bill 88 passed last year which
 
00:17:28.690 --> 00:17:28.700 align:start position:0%
we interpret as directing the department
 
00:17:33.049 --> 00:17:33.059 align:start position:0%
to effectively adopt nearly verbatim the
 
00:17:34.789 --> 00:17:34.799 align:start position:0%
rules of the Federal Communications
 
00:17:36.650 --> 00:17:36.660 align:start position:0%
Commission regarding One Touch make
 
00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.789 align:start position:0%
Commission regarding One Touch make
ready

00:17:37.789 --> 00:17:37.799 align:start position:0%
ready
 
00:17:40.789 --> 00:17:40.799 align:start position:0%
we believe it's important to do that in
 
00:17:42.529 --> 00:17:42.539 align:start position:0%
order to affect the legislative intent
 
00:17:45.049 --> 00:17:45.059 align:start position:0%
to facilitate Broadband expansion in the
 
00:17:47.450 --> 00:17:47.460 align:start position:0%
state by making it easier for new
 
00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:50.520 align:start position:0%
attaching entities to install fiber
 
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
cable and other facilities on existing
 
00:17:55.610 --> 00:17:55.620 align:start position:0%
utility poles
 
00:17:58.070 --> 00:17:58.080 align:start position:0%
and I will note that in our rulemaking
 
00:18:01.070 --> 00:18:01.080 align:start position:0%
process there was almost unanimous
 
00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
support for adopting the FCC rules
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
nearly verbatim as I say in these State
 
00:18:10.970 --> 00:18:10.980 align:start position:0%
rules consistent with that legislative
 
00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:14.340 align:start position:0%
intent in Sp 88 so that was the decision
 
00:18:16.250 --> 00:18:16.260 align:start position:0%
that we made with respect to the new
 
00:18:16.260 --> 00:18:17.409 align:start position:0%
that we made with respect to the new
section

00:18:17.409 --> 00:18:17.419 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:18:21.049 --> 00:18:21.059 align:start position:0%
130313 which incorporates the One Touch
 
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:25.380 align:start position:0%
Make Ready rules into State rules and
 
00:18:28.610 --> 00:18:28.620 align:start position:0%
the FCC rules not constrained by some of
 
00:18:30.169 --> 00:18:30.179 align:start position:0%
the limitations that we see in the
 
00:18:32.630 --> 00:18:32.640 align:start position:0%
rulemaking manual here include language
 
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
such as as reasonable and good faith and
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
so we incorporated that here I've had
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
this conversation with attorney Reeve
 
00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:44.280 align:start position:0%
and we discussed a potential language
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
change that might be made in section
 
00:18:51.890 --> 00:18:51.900 align:start position:0%
130301 A where there's a broad reference
 
00:18:54.409 --> 00:18:54.419 align:start position:0%
to terms that are just reasonable and
 
00:18:54.419 --> 00:18:56.029 align:start position:0%
to terms that are just reasonable and
non-discriminatory

00:18:56.029 --> 00:18:56.039 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory
 
00:18:57.650 --> 00:18:57.660 align:start position:0%
and we do think that there would be an
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity there to remove that
 
00:19:01.850 --> 00:19:01.860 align:start position:0%
language and merely reference the state
 
00:19:06.590 --> 00:19:06.600 align:start position:0%
statute RSA 374 34-a
 
00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:08.160 align:start position:0%
and if the committee would would
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
entertain that I might offer that as an
 
00:19:13.190 --> 00:19:13.200 align:start position:0%
additional condition that might be
 
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
considered for approval this morning
 
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:19.200 align:start position:0%
with respect to the other language that
 
00:19:21.110 --> 00:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
was called into question by the OLS
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
comments uh I will just offer that that
 
00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
language appears in the FCC rules
 
00:19:31.490 --> 00:19:31.500 align:start position:0%
and uh it and in in particular in
 
00:19:35.810 --> 00:19:35.820 align:start position:0%
reference to section 1303 12 also uh
 
00:19:38.870 --> 00:19:38.880 align:start position:0%
appears in the existing puc 1300 rules
 
00:19:41.330 --> 00:19:41.340 align:start position:0%
which again we are just bringing over to
 
00:19:42.710 --> 00:19:42.720 align:start position:0%
the Department of energy in this
 
00:19:45.289 --> 00:19:45.299 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process
 
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:48.480 align:start position:0%
um I I will I will add perhaps some
 
00:19:51.289 --> 00:19:51.299 align:start position:0%
Nuance to attorney Reeves comments on
 
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:53.820 align:start position:0%
1303 13.
 
00:19:56.710 --> 00:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
I think in our view it is not possible
 
00:19:58.970 --> 00:19:58.980 align:start position:0%
to both
 
00:19:58.980 --> 00:19:59.810 align:start position:0%
to both
um

00:19:59.810 --> 00:19:59.820 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:03.110 --> 00:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
to to accommodate the legislative intent
 
00:20:04.909 --> 00:20:04.919 align:start position:0%
to incorporate the one-touch make-ready
 
00:20:08.409 --> 00:20:08.419 align:start position:0%
rules of the FCC into these new energy
 
00:20:12.110 --> 00:20:12.120 align:start position:0%
1300 rules uh and comply with the
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
rulemaking manual
 
00:20:16.730 --> 00:20:16.740 align:start position:0%
because the FCC rules as I noted contain
 
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:19.320 align:start position:0%
the word reasonable in in a number of
 
00:20:22.490 --> 00:20:22.500 align:start position:0%
places and we carried that over I think
 
00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:23.880 align:start position:0%
our view is that we would not be
 
00:20:26.150 --> 00:20:26.160 align:start position:0%
honoring the legislative intent to
 
00:20:27.950 --> 00:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
incorporate those Provisions if we were
 
00:20:31.130 --> 00:20:31.140 align:start position:0%
to drop that language uh in in strict
 
00:20:32.990 --> 00:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with the rule making manual
 
00:20:35.570 --> 00:20:35.580 align:start position:0%
so I I think our position is that this
 
00:20:39.650 --> 00:20:39.660 align:start position:0%
is uh a place where variants from the
 
00:20:41.810 --> 00:20:41.820 align:start position:0%
manual makes sense because it is not
 
00:20:43.730 --> 00:20:43.740 align:start position:0%
possible to comply both with the manual
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
and with the more specific legislative
 
00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
intent in SB 88 that that we deem as
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
requiring the department to adopt nearly
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
verbatim those FCC specifications
 
00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:00.600 align:start position:0%
and the FCC rules I'll just note are
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
well understood by the regulated
 
00:21:06.409 --> 00:21:06.419 align:start position:0%
Community as we understand it most of
 
00:21:07.490 --> 00:21:07.500 align:start position:0%
whom are sophisticated
 
00:21:09.470 --> 00:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
telecommunications carriers and you
 
00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:11.160 align:start position:0%
heard from uh one of their
 
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
representatives this morning that they
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
support the rules as proposed
 
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:18.660 align:start position:0%
representative Gore
 
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:21:23.690 --> 00:21:23.700 align:start position:0%
uh attorney Wiesner I'm curious how you
 
00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:27.799 align:start position:0%
interpret shall adopt rules under 541a
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
implementing the provisions of One Touch
 
00:21:34.870 --> 00:21:34.880 align:start position:0%
make ready as adopted by the FCC as
 
00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
incorporate the federal rules into our
 
00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.890 align:start position:0%
incorporate the federal rules into our
rules

00:21:39.890 --> 00:21:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:41.409 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:21:41.409 --> 00:21:41.419 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
we believe the legislative intent was
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
for those One Touch Make Ready rules as
 
00:21:49.669 --> 00:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
written by the FCC that's not what the
 
00:21:51.950 --> 00:21:51.960 align:start position:0%
statute says
 
00:21:55.149 --> 00:21:55.159 align:start position:0%
it says adopt rules under 541a
 
00:21:58.190 --> 00:21:58.200 align:start position:0%
implementing the provisions of the One
 
00:22:01.490 --> 00:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
Touch Make Ready rules
 
00:22:04.669 --> 00:22:04.679 align:start position:0%
and I I believe that in cases of
 
00:22:07.750 --> 00:22:07.760 align:start position:0%
question without specific other
 
00:22:11.270 --> 00:22:11.280 align:start position:0%
legislative intent data that's what it
 
00:22:14.390 --> 00:22:14.400 align:start position:0%
says implement the provisions our view
 
00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:15.780 align:start position:0%
was that implementing the provisions
 
00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:18.720 align:start position:0%
without the word reasonable would not be
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:28.070 --> 00:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:22:29.930 --> 00:22:29.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I guess this is a
 
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
question for for staff over there it
 
00:22:33.950 --> 00:22:33.960 align:start position:0%
seems like our argument is around the
 
00:22:36.230 --> 00:22:36.240 align:start position:0%
word just Regional non-discriminatory
 
00:22:37.970 --> 00:22:37.980 align:start position:0%
and good and sufficient cause those
 
00:22:40.190 --> 00:22:40.200 align:start position:0%
phrases are repeated throughout the
 
00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:41.940 align:start position:0%
statute throughout the rule-making
 
00:22:45.409 --> 00:22:45.419 align:start position:0%
authority and and I guess my my question
 
00:22:48.590 --> 00:22:48.600 align:start position:0%
is absent a definition in the rule
 
00:22:50.990 --> 00:22:51.000 align:start position:0%
aren't those you know going back to my
 
00:22:52.970 --> 00:22:52.980 align:start position:0%
prosecutor those days those are pretty
 
00:22:55.010 --> 00:22:55.020 align:start position:0%
clearly defined legal definitions to
 
00:22:56.330 --> 00:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
00:22:58.370 --> 00:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
um that they're easily found and easily
 
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:01.320 align:start position:0%
understood and if I follow up if I it
 
00:23:03.049 --> 00:23:03.059 align:start position:0%
developed to represent Maguire's
 
00:23:06.529 --> 00:23:06.539 align:start position:0%
question if the FCC rule contained the
 
00:23:08.930 --> 00:23:08.940 align:start position:0%
word reasonable how can our rule not
 
00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:10.260 align:start position:0%
contain the word reasonable if we're
 
00:23:12.710 --> 00:23:12.720 align:start position:0%
supposed to implement their rule so I I
 
00:23:14.870 --> 00:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
guess that's a two-fold question is it
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
seems like the legal definitions are
 
00:23:17.930 --> 00:23:17.940 align:start position:0%
clear they've they've been they've been
 
00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:20.280 align:start position:0%
adjudicated many times on those four
 
00:23:22.909 --> 00:23:22.919 align:start position:0%
different words uh or phrases and
 
00:23:24.950 --> 00:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
secondarily as if if they in did
 
00:23:26.750 --> 00:23:26.760 align:start position:0%
incorporate the exact rule which would
 
00:23:28.490 --> 00:23:28.500 align:start position:0%
contain the rain reasonable we'd have
 
00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:30.720 align:start position:0%
the same problem so I guess I'm I'm not
 
00:23:32.270 --> 00:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
I'm struggling to understand why we
 
00:23:34.789 --> 00:23:34.799 align:start position:0%
would object to this okay so there are
 
00:23:37.430 --> 00:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
two different places so one is the
 
00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:40.620 align:start position:0%
statute 374 and it does use some of
 
00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:42.200 align:start position:0%
these terms um just in
 
00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory and I believe it does
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
use good and sufficient cause I wouldn't
 
00:23:48.970 --> 00:23:48.980 align:start position:0%
say that just reasonable or
 
00:23:51.529 --> 00:23:51.539 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory is well defined it's
 
00:23:55.250 --> 00:23:55.260 align:start position:0%
certainly not defined in the statute and
 
00:23:58.730 --> 00:23:58.740 align:start position:0%
so um as I said earlier rules are
 
00:24:01.070 --> 00:24:01.080 align:start position:0%
supposed to make specific and Implement
 
00:24:03.710 --> 00:24:03.720 align:start position:0%
and interpret the statute so the statute
 
00:24:05.810 --> 00:24:05.820 align:start position:0%
doesn't Define it then the rule needs to
 
00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:07.100 align:start position:0%
Define it
 
00:24:10.250 --> 00:24:10.260 align:start position:0%
what one attorney may think means
 
00:24:11.750 --> 00:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
reasonable another attorney made
 
00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:13.740 align:start position:0%
disagree and think there's another
 
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:16.260 align:start position:0%
definition for the word reasonable it's
 
00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740 align:start position:0%
pretty squishy generally
 
00:24:22.789 --> 00:24:22.799 align:start position:0%
the the second issue is on the word
 
00:24:26.570 --> 00:24:26.580 align:start position:0%
reasonable as found in the FCC that also
 
00:24:28.970 --> 00:24:28.980 align:start position:0%
I didn't see a definition in the federal
 
00:24:32.590 --> 00:24:32.600 align:start position:0%
statute for that there could be one
 
00:24:37.870 --> 00:24:37.880 align:start position:0%
but I didn't find one so we typically
 
00:24:41.210 --> 00:24:41.220 align:start position:0%
you know recommend or we typically flag
 
00:24:43.610 --> 00:24:43.620 align:start position:0%
these sorts of words because they
 
00:24:47.330 --> 00:24:47.340 align:start position:0%
introduce ambiguity into the rule just
 
00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:49.260 align:start position:0%
like I said earlier one attorney may
 
00:24:51.409 --> 00:24:51.419 align:start position:0%
think that reasonable opportunity is
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
five days another may think it's 10 days
 
00:24:57.049 --> 00:24:57.059 align:start position:0%
so it's it's up really to the agency to
 
00:24:59.570 --> 00:24:59.580 align:start position:0%
Define what that means when the statute
 
00:25:01.250 --> 00:25:01.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't Define it
 
00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:04.980 align:start position:0%
so um I will point out that in the puc
 
00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
proposal that the committee recently
 
00:25:09.830 --> 00:25:09.840 align:start position:0%
heard they also use terms like just
 
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:12.900 align:start position:0%
reasonable and for the public good and
 
00:25:14.750 --> 00:25:14.760 align:start position:0%
we had some conversation with them about
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
that and they said that it was um it was
 
00:25:19.549 --> 00:25:19.559 align:start position:0%
essentially in case law and it was an
 
00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:21.780 align:start position:0%
adjudicative process and so they did not
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
feel comfortable defining that so what
 
00:25:25.490 --> 00:25:25.500 align:start position:0%
they ended up doing was talking to the
 
00:25:27.830 --> 00:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
AG's office and then just referring back
 
00:25:29.710 --> 00:25:29.720 align:start position:0%
over to the statute
 
00:25:33.409 --> 00:25:33.419 align:start position:0%
so in my conversation with the
 
00:25:35.210 --> 00:25:35.220 align:start position:0%
Department that was essentially what I
 
00:25:37.490 --> 00:25:37.500 align:start position:0%
recommended and what he's proposing with
 
00:25:39.289 --> 00:25:39.299 align:start position:0%
that first section or that first set of
 
00:25:42.230 --> 00:25:42.240 align:start position:0%
comments that you see on the bottom of
 
00:25:45.649 --> 00:25:45.659 align:start position:0%
page two so here instead of using the
 
00:25:46.789 --> 00:25:46.799 align:start position:0%
terms just reasonable and
 
00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
non-discriminatory they would just refer
 
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:51.840 align:start position:0%
back over to 374 34A
 
00:25:53.930 --> 00:25:53.940 align:start position:0%
so I mean that would somewhat deal with
 
00:25:53.940 --> 00:25:55.250 align:start position:0%
so I mean that would somewhat deal with
it

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:55.260 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:25:57.830 --> 00:25:57.840 align:start position:0%
um it still leaves it up in the air as
 
00:26:00.529 --> 00:26:00.539 align:start position:0%
far as exactly what that means
 
00:26:03.110 --> 00:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
um I could point out that if the
 
00:26:04.850 --> 00:26:04.860 align:start position:0%
stakeholders and the FCC if everybody
 
00:26:07.610 --> 00:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
knows what these terms mean then they
 
00:26:09.710 --> 00:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
should be able to kind of arrive at
 
00:26:12.529 --> 00:26:12.539 align:start position:0%
something you know to Define it but it
 
00:26:15.289 --> 00:26:15.299 align:start position:0%
may be that there is some disagreement
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
as to what those terms would mean and
 
00:26:20.510 --> 00:26:20.520 align:start position:0%
they don't want to to do that here in
 
00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:22.140 align:start position:0%
the rule
 
00:26:24.169 --> 00:26:24.179 align:start position:0%
um to get back to the other point I was
 
00:26:27.830 --> 00:26:27.840 align:start position:0%
making the the FCC rules are only in
 
00:26:31.549 --> 00:26:31.559 align:start position:0%
section 13 and that's some of the FCC
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
requirements may be sprinkled throughout
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
but my understanding is that it's mostly
 
00:26:39.230 --> 00:26:39.240 align:start position:0%
in section 13 here and that's where
 
00:26:41.149 --> 00:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
they're using some terms around
 
00:26:41.159 --> 00:26:43.070 align:start position:0%
they're using some terms around
reasonable

00:26:43.070 --> 00:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
reasonable
 
00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:43.990 align:start position:0%
reasonable
um

00:26:43.990 --> 00:26:44.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:46.500 align:start position:0%
that section doesn't have those terms
 
00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:49.340 align:start position:0%
just public good or
 
00:26:51.769 --> 00:26:51.779 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination in this particular
 
00:26:51.779 --> 00:26:53.529 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination in this particular
section

00:26:53.529 --> 00:26:53.539 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:26:57.350 --> 00:26:57.360 align:start position:0%
hopefully that answers the question
 
00:27:00.110 --> 00:27:00.120 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes in response to
 
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
representative Lang's question I I would
 
00:27:04.909 --> 00:27:04.919 align:start position:0%
point out you know in regards to making
 
00:27:08.029 --> 00:27:08.039 align:start position:0%
these comments uh staff is statutorily
 
00:27:11.149 --> 00:27:11.159 align:start position:0%
obligated to raise any potential basis
 
00:27:13.269 --> 00:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
for objection committee can certainly
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
disagree or even if it thinks there is a
 
00:27:18.590 --> 00:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
basis for objection uh under the law
 
00:27:22.730 --> 00:27:22.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
so just to make sure I understand where
 
00:27:26.810 --> 00:27:26.820 align:start position:0%
we're sitting right now right now we
 
00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760 align:start position:0%
have a conditional approval request
 
00:27:31.130 --> 00:27:31.140 align:start position:0%
they've made some preliminary language
 
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
changes that they based on the
 
00:27:34.490 --> 00:27:34.500 align:start position:0%
objections of Staff in that first
 
00:27:36.769 --> 00:27:36.779 align:start position:0%
section and that's what's presented him
 
00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:39.240 align:start position:0%
before us right now for a vote
 
00:27:43.970 --> 00:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
yes yes and it it well it sounds like um
 
00:27:46.789 --> 00:27:46.799 align:start position:0%
so the the so they do have a conditional
 
00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
approval that you're um that's on the
 
00:27:52.310 --> 00:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
table and then they've also um suggested
 
00:27:54.470 --> 00:27:54.480 align:start position:0%
some additional language in that first
 
00:27:56.390 --> 00:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
section so it would be an amended
 
00:27:58.190 --> 00:27:58.200 align:start position:0%
conditional approval assuming that the
 
00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:00.179 align:start position:0%
committee is an agreement with that
 
00:28:00.179 --> 00:28:01.549 align:start position:0%
committee is an agreement with that
language

00:28:01.549 --> 00:28:01.559 align:start position:0%
language
 
00:28:03.169 --> 00:28:03.179 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
00:28:06.169 --> 00:28:06.179 align:start position:0%
looking for an objection motion
 
00:28:09.049 --> 00:28:09.059 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman since representative patch
 
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
is now in uh representative Gruen could
 
00:28:14.269 --> 00:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
be appointed for Senate Apprentice who
 
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:16.500 align:start position:0%
is the only remaining member not here
 
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I'm going to move to approve
 
00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:26.460 align:start position:0%
what the language suggestion number one
 
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:37.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.289 --> 00:28:39.299 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh disregarding the other
 
00:28:45.470 --> 00:28:45.480 align:start position:0%
issues I'm concerned that this doesn't
 
00:28:49.370 --> 00:28:49.380 align:start position:0%
seem to repeal the existing puc rules
 
00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:51.480 align:start position:0%
and I wonder if you would clarify that
 
00:28:53.269 --> 00:28:53.279 align:start position:0%
for us
 
00:28:55.549 --> 00:28:55.559 align:start position:0%
I I believe that
 
00:28:58.130 --> 00:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
probably next month the puc will be
 
00:29:00.049 --> 00:29:00.059 align:start position:0%
before you with their amended version of
 
00:29:04.850 --> 00:29:04.860 align:start position:0%
the puc 1300 rules and that will remove
 
00:29:06.890 --> 00:29:06.900 align:start position:0%
all of these sections that appear here
 
00:29:09.649 --> 00:29:09.659 align:start position:0%
and retain for the puc only the
 
00:29:11.750 --> 00:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
functions of dispute resolution and rate
 
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
setting so if you were to look at the
 
00:29:16.010 --> 00:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
existing puc rules I believe it's
 
00:29:20.210 --> 00:29:20.220 align:start position:0%
section 1304 will remain with the puc
 
00:29:22.210 --> 00:29:22.220 align:start position:0%
and the definitions that go with it
 
00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:24.360 align:start position:0%
meanwhile all of the other substantive
 
00:29:26.149 --> 00:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
Provisions will be adopted by the
 
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:28.020 align:start position:0%
department of energy through these rules
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
and it is our intent to see that those
 
00:29:33.769 --> 00:29:33.779 align:start position:0%
two sets of rules are new rules and
 
00:29:35.870 --> 00:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
their amended rules will become
 
00:29:38.049 --> 00:29:38.059 align:start position:0%
effective at the same time
 
00:29:40.370 --> 00:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
that would be good having two sets of
 
00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:42.960 align:start position:0%
rules at the same that were
 
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:45.740 align:start position:0%
in effect would be uh inconvenient
 
00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:47.820 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire
 
00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:50.340 align:start position:0%
um the notice number for that one is 20
 
00:29:54.350 --> 00:29:54.360 align:start position:0%
22 55 I have reviewed the um initial
 
00:29:56.750 --> 00:29:56.760 align:start position:0%
proposal and they do have comments so
 
00:30:03.590 --> 00:30:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:07.010 --> 00:30:07.020 align:start position:0%
I'd prefer that we object to this and
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:14.460 align:start position:0%
hash out these
 
00:30:16.730 --> 00:30:16.740 align:start position:0%
language differences
 
00:30:19.250 --> 00:30:19.260 align:start position:0%
so we have a motion on the table
 
00:30:22.370 --> 00:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
that I will be voting no on
 
00:30:26.210 --> 00:30:26.220 align:start position:0%
to approve the rule so all those
 
00:30:28.130 --> 00:30:28.140 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
00:30:32.149 --> 00:30:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:32.159 --> 00:30:39.409 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:30:39.409 --> 00:30:39.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.230 --> 00:30:42.240 align:start position:0%
motion by Schmidt to object second by
 
00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:44.690 align:start position:0%
motion by Schmidt to object second by
hatch

00:30:44.690 --> 00:30:44.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
will they need a waiver
 
00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:50.340 align:start position:0%
are we they didn't they would we would
 
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
need a label okay
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
no wait a second it's November it's
 
00:30:58.610 --> 00:30:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:01.909 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:31:01.909 --> 00:31:01.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:04.029 --> 00:31:04.039 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:31:07.730 --> 00:31:07.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:08.990 --> 00:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:12.970 --> 00:31:12.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.430 --> 00:31:16.440 align:start position:0%
and next on the menu Department of
 
00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:19.020 align:start position:0%
Agriculture feeding garbage to swine
 
00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:23.210 align:start position:0%
Agriculture feeding garbage to swine
rules

00:31:23.210 --> 00:31:23.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:25.010 --> 00:31:25.020 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.049 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
so

00:31:27.049 --> 00:31:27.059 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:31:28.850 --> 00:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
this particular rule there was a
 
00:31:30.529 --> 00:31:30.539 align:start position:0%
conditional approval
 
00:31:33.529 --> 00:31:33.539 align:start position:0%
request filed within the time limits for
 
00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
this meeting
 
00:31:37.730 --> 00:31:37.740 align:start position:0%
it was accepted and reviewed on the
 
00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:40.020 align:start position:0%
website there is a cover memo for the
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
final proposal packet at the very bottom
 
00:31:44.990 --> 00:31:45.000 align:start position:0%
we apologize that it's not with the
 
00:31:46.549 --> 00:31:46.559 align:start position:0%
conditional approval response on the
 
00:31:48.409 --> 00:31:48.419 align:start position:0%
website but it is there at the bottom if
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
anyone wanted to review that but the
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
remaining comments from the conditional
 
00:31:55.850 --> 00:31:55.860 align:start position:0%
approval request
 
00:31:59.389 --> 00:31:59.399 align:start position:0%
um is one unclear legislative intent
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
comment on page three and two notes to
 
00:32:07.669 --> 00:32:07.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:07.679 --> 00:32:08.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:32:08.389 --> 00:32:08.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:32:10.730 --> 00:32:10.740 align:start position:0%
commenting on the fact that the statute
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
has been effect since 1995 and this is
 
00:32:16.210 --> 00:32:16.220 align:start position:0%
the first time that the agency is
 
00:32:18.889 --> 00:32:18.899 align:start position:0%
proposing rules for this particular
 
00:32:18.899 --> 00:32:20.870 align:start position:0%
proposing rules for this particular
section

00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:22.760 align:start position:0%
the rules also
 
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:27.360 align:start position:0%
comment on an application fee which is
 
00:32:31.789 --> 00:32:31.799 align:start position:0%
statutorily set in RSA 435 34 for a sum
 
00:32:33.549 --> 00:32:33.559 align:start position:0%
of ten dollars
 
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
additionally for penalties reflected in
 
00:32:40.970 --> 00:32:40.980 align:start position:0%
RSA 43540 it does state that any person
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
who violates the statute or rules if
 
00:32:45.289 --> 00:32:45.299 align:start position:0%
they're any is guilty of a misdemeanor
 
00:32:47.269 --> 00:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
it may have an administrative fine no
 
00:32:48.649 --> 00:32:48.659 align:start position:0%
more than five thousand dollars levied
 
00:32:50.750 --> 00:32:50.760 align:start position:0%
against them by the commissioner so the
 
00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:52.700 align:start position:0%
statute does also cover penalties
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
without rules
 
00:32:57.169 --> 00:32:57.179 align:start position:0%
with regard to the second note to jail
 
00:32:59.810 --> 00:32:59.820 align:start position:0%
car it's just commenting that the agency
 
00:33:01.909 --> 00:33:01.919 align:start position:0%
does have the statutory authority to
 
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
enter the premises of a licensee which
 
00:33:07.370 --> 00:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
is reflected in their rules
 
00:33:09.970 --> 00:33:09.980 align:start position:0%
the legislative intent unclear comment
 
00:33:12.230 --> 00:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
on page three
 
00:33:14.570 --> 00:33:14.580 align:start position:0%
has to do with these special permits
 
00:33:17.149 --> 00:33:17.159 align:start position:0%
granted by the commissioner the way the
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
rule is currently written is that no
 
00:33:22.549 --> 00:33:22.559 align:start position:0%
swine fed garbage that has not been
 
00:33:24.350 --> 00:33:24.360 align:start position:0%
properly cooked or treated shall be
 
00:33:26.409 --> 00:33:26.419 align:start position:0%
moved into or within New Hampshire
 
00:33:28.970 --> 00:33:28.980 align:start position:0%
unless pursuant to special permission
 
00:33:30.950 --> 00:33:30.960 align:start position:0%
granted in writing by the commissioner
 
00:33:33.830 --> 00:33:33.840 align:start position:0%
at the commissioner's Soul discretion
 
00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.080 align:start position:0%
this rule lacks criteria to
 
00:33:40.549 --> 00:33:40.559 align:start position:0%
outline what exactly is considered when
 
00:33:43.850 --> 00:33:43.860 align:start position:0%
a special perm permission is considered
 
00:33:45.830 --> 00:33:45.840 align:start position:0%
by the commissioner in what criteria the
 
00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:48.860 align:start position:0%
commissioner will make that decision on
 
00:33:52.029 --> 00:33:52.039 align:start position:0%
which leaves room for oral rule making
 
00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:56.640 align:start position:0%
which is prohibited by RSA 541a1
 
00:33:58.669 --> 00:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
I have had some discussions with the
 
00:34:01.070 --> 00:34:01.080 align:start position:0%
agency about specific criteria the
 
00:34:03.250 --> 00:34:03.260 align:start position:0%
agency believes that
 
00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:04.980 align:start position:0%
in the
 
00:34:06.590 --> 00:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
Communications I've had with the agency
 
00:34:08.869 --> 00:34:08.879 align:start position:0%
they have voice that they believe that
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
having criteria would be too
 
00:34:13.369 --> 00:34:13.379 align:start position:0%
that the criteria considered is too
 
00:34:16.790 --> 00:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
broad to actually be put into rules
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
um however there was some back and forth
 
00:34:20.450 --> 00:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
discussion about potential
 
00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:22.859 align:start position:0%
language that could be used as criteria
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
but no amended conditional approval
 
00:34:27.409 --> 00:34:27.419 align:start position:0%
request was received so at this time
 
00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:30.899 align:start position:0%
that comment is still standing
 
00:34:40.329 --> 00:34:40.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:42.589 --> 00:34:42.599 align:start position:0%
you turn it on
 
00:34:44.869 --> 00:34:44.879 align:start position:0%
thank you uh Steve Crawford State
 
00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
veterinarian New Hampshire Department of
 
00:34:47.690 --> 00:34:47.700 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food good
 
00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:49.849 align:start position:0%
Agriculture markets and food good
morning

00:34:49.849 --> 00:34:49.859 align:start position:0%
morning
 
00:34:51.589 --> 00:34:51.599 align:start position:0%
so I
 
00:34:53.629 --> 00:34:53.639 align:start position:0%
I the summary that you heard was was
 
00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:55.260 align:start position:0%
accurate we there were a couple of
 
00:34:56.810 --> 00:34:56.820 align:start position:0%
substantive comments earlier we we
 
00:34:58.310 --> 00:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
yielded on one because we did not
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
believe that there would be any emergent
 
00:35:03.650 --> 00:35:03.660 align:start position:0%
implications to approving other forms of
 
00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:05.220 align:start position:0%
treating garbage in this particular
 
00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
instance though the department thinks
 
00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:07.930 align:start position:0%
instance though the department thinks
that

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:07.940 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
just in time Disease Control flexibility
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
is necessary and we also think it's
 
00:35:14.750 --> 00:35:14.760 align:start position:0%
already allowed in statute there are a
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
couple of pieces of statute
 
00:35:18.890 --> 00:35:18.900 align:start position:0%
that that we believe cover the same
 
00:35:22.130 --> 00:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
thing that is proposed in that 405 B
 
00:35:22.140 --> 00:35:23.390 align:start position:0%
thing that is proposed in that 405 B
um

00:35:23.390 --> 00:35:23.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
so Interstate quarantine
 
00:35:28.609 --> 00:35:28.619 align:start position:0%
management decisions are authorized
 
00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839 align:start position:0%
under 436.35
 
00:35:32.690 --> 00:35:32.700 align:start position:0%
that section actually uses May three
 
00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:34.680 align:start position:0%
times doesn't use shell
 
00:35:36.530 --> 00:35:36.540 align:start position:0%
so I believe we have that flexibility
 
00:35:38.750 --> 00:35:38.760 align:start position:0%
already and we've seen with the high
 
00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
path of influenza stuff we've been
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with this year that just in time
 
00:35:43.430 --> 00:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
changes are kind of important for us to
 
00:35:45.290 --> 00:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
be able to make the right decision
 
00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
rather than having to go through an
 
00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:48.780 align:start position:0%
emergency rule making session so
 
00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
we're open to
 
00:35:52.670 --> 00:35:52.680 align:start position:0%
to finding the language that that
 
00:35:54.109 --> 00:35:54.119 align:start position:0%
maintains that latitude for the
 
00:35:55.490 --> 00:35:55.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner to make just-in-time
 
00:35:57.950 --> 00:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
Disease Control decisions and with again
 
00:36:00.950 --> 00:36:00.960 align:start position:0%
conditional approvals that we're seeking
 
00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:03.540 align:start position:0%
so does staff believe that you can come
 
00:36:08.329 --> 00:36:08.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:12.109 --> 00:36:12.119 align:start position:0%
um well Mr chair the agency did send an
 
00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:13.920 align:start position:0%
email with some language that could
 
00:36:17.030 --> 00:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
potentially be turned into a rule in my
 
00:36:20.650 --> 00:36:20.660 align:start position:0%
opinion specifically that uh special
 
00:36:22.849 --> 00:36:22.859 align:start position:0%
permission will be Grant shall be
 
00:36:25.069 --> 00:36:25.079 align:start position:0%
granted when
 
00:36:30.050 --> 00:36:30.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:33.290 --> 00:36:33.300 align:start position:0%
I apologize special permission shall be
 
00:36:36.829 --> 00:36:36.839 align:start position:0%
granted in the most efficient expedient
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
and effective way possible we're still
 
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
working on that language to get that in
 
00:36:44.530 --> 00:36:44.540 align:start position:0%
a place where it would be
 
00:36:46.970 --> 00:36:46.980 align:start position:0%
specific enough for criteria but also
 
00:36:48.770 --> 00:36:48.780 align:start position:0%
broad enough to allow the agency some
 
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
discretion to deal with those time
 
00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
sensitive issues
 
00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
so it is possible that we could come to
 
00:37:01.010 --> 00:37:01.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:01.020 --> 00:37:05.990 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:37:05.990 --> 00:37:06.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:09.050 --> 00:37:09.060 align:start position:0%
yes I hear that Dr Crawford how often
 
00:37:10.790 --> 00:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
does this come up is this a common
 
00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.370 align:start position:0%
does this come up is this a common
practice

00:37:12.370 --> 00:37:12.380 align:start position:0%
practice
 
00:37:15.710 --> 00:37:15.720 align:start position:0%
the the asking broadly about garbage
 
00:37:16.910 --> 00:37:16.920 align:start position:0%
feeding or asking specifically about
 
00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:18.599 align:start position:0%
this interstate movement permissions
 
00:37:20.870 --> 00:37:20.880 align:start position:0%
both um garbage feeding is a common
 
00:37:22.730 --> 00:37:22.740 align:start position:0%
practice it's been authorized under
 
00:37:25.250 --> 00:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
federal statute since the mid 80s and as
 
00:37:27.109 --> 00:37:27.119 align:start position:0%
you heard the department has never
 
00:37:28.790 --> 00:37:28.800 align:start position:0%
sought to implement rules because the
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
statute doesn't require us to have rules
 
00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
it authorizes a commissioner to have
 
00:37:34.670 --> 00:37:34.680 align:start position:0%
them when we think it's appropriate
 
00:37:36.829 --> 00:37:36.839 align:start position:0%
we have seen over the last several years
 
00:37:38.810 --> 00:37:38.820 align:start position:0%
and USDA has always done those
 
00:37:40.190 --> 00:37:40.200 align:start position:0%
inspections for us
 
00:37:41.750 --> 00:37:41.760 align:start position:0%
we have seen over the last several years
 
00:37:43.970 --> 00:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
USDA pulling back its resource
 
00:37:45.589 --> 00:37:45.599 align:start position:0%
allocation to the state so we think it's
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate the timing was appropriate
 
00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:49.740 align:start position:0%
for us to have our own rules set
 
00:37:51.770 --> 00:37:51.780 align:start position:0%
um in terms of
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
management of Interstate quarantines
 
00:37:57.370 --> 00:37:57.380 align:start position:0%
several times a year probably
 
00:37:59.569 --> 00:37:59.579 align:start position:0%
more in the last year with high path
 
00:38:01.490 --> 00:38:01.500 align:start position:0%
Haven influenza but several times a year
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
we're making these types of decisions
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
about how to deal with something on a
 
00:38:07.550 --> 00:38:07.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.550 --> 00:38:10.560 align:start position:0%
so so several times a year someone
 
00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:13.859 align:start position:0%
wishes to move garbage feds flying out
 
00:38:15.290 --> 00:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
of well not of New Hampshire you won't
 
00:38:17.150 --> 00:38:17.160 align:start position:0%
care it's into New Hampshire that's the
 
00:38:20.690 --> 00:38:20.700 align:start position:0%
issue I I guess my apologies I was too I
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
was thinking quarantines broadly not
 
00:38:23.230 --> 00:38:23.240 align:start position:0%
just quarantines related to this
 
00:38:26.930 --> 00:38:26.940 align:start position:0%
quarantine's related to this uh
 
00:38:28.130 --> 00:38:28.140 align:start position:0%
I don't recall the last time a
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
quarantine related to garbage feds fine
 
00:38:31.730 --> 00:38:31.740 align:start position:0%
has come up but other livestock that we
 
00:38:33.470 --> 00:38:33.480 align:start position:0%
have authority over several times a year
 
00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:38.690 align:start position:0%
have authority over several times a year
sorry

00:38:38.690 --> 00:38:38.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:42.200 align:start position:0%
so if I understand you correctly
 
00:38:47.030 --> 00:38:47.040 align:start position:0%
these special permission and writing is
 
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
extremely rare yes ma'am thank you
 
00:38:55.010 --> 00:38:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:58.010 align:start position:0%
 
second

00:38:58.010 --> 00:38:58.020 align:start position:0%
second
 
00:39:00.770 --> 00:39:00.780 align:start position:0%
ocean by hatch second by McGuire it's a
 
00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:03.180 align:start position:0%
conditionally approve
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
and encourage your consultation with the
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
staff I understood
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
any discussion
 
00:39:13.190 --> 00:39:13.200 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
aye any opposed
 
00:39:26.270 --> 00:39:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission employee incentive
 
00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:31.370 align:start position:0%
Liquor Commission employee incentive
programs

00:39:31.370 --> 00:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:39:31.380 --> 00:39:32.569 align:start position:0%
programs
um

00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
so this um this set of rules would
 
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
Implement an employee incentive program
 
00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:40.380 align:start position:0%
in which employees can get
 
00:39:43.210 --> 00:39:43.220 align:start position:0%
um you know monetary incentive for sales
 
00:39:46.730 --> 00:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
there's only one issue to talk about in
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
regards to these rules and you'll see
 
00:39:51.069 --> 00:39:51.079 align:start position:0%
that on the first page of the rule set
 
00:39:54.970 --> 00:39:54.980 align:start position:0%
which is on page four the linked PDF
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
so hb2 in 2011 established that the
 
00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:02.760 align:start position:0%
agency May develop and Implement an
 
00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:05.280 align:start position:0%
employee incentive program and it
 
00:40:07.550 --> 00:40:07.560 align:start position:0%
required the agency to implement that
 
00:40:10.790 --> 00:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
program via rules adopted through 541a
 
00:40:13.849 --> 00:40:13.859 align:start position:0%
so this is the first time that the
 
00:40:15.829 --> 00:40:15.839 align:start position:0%
agency has done any rules for this
 
00:40:15.839 --> 00:40:16.930 align:start position:0%
agency has done any rules for this
program

00:40:16.930 --> 00:40:16.940 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:40:19.870 --> 00:40:19.880 align:start position:0%
in response to OLS comment about
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
implementing the rules or implementing
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
the program prior to adopting the rules
 
00:40:26.630 --> 00:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
the agency has indicated that they have
 
00:40:29.329 --> 00:40:29.339 align:start position:0%
not implemented the program at all the
 
00:40:30.950 --> 00:40:30.960 align:start position:0%
committee may have some questions about
 
00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:34.370 align:start position:0%
committee may have some questions about
that

00:40:34.370 --> 00:40:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:34.380 --> 00:40:40.910 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:42.780 align:start position:0%
are you here from the liquor committee I
 
00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
am all right good morning my name is
 
00:40:46.609 --> 00:40:46.619 align:start position:0%
James Vera I'm a CEO of the Liquor
 
00:40:47.690 --> 00:40:47.700 align:start position:0%
Commission prior to that when they were
 
00:40:50.630 --> 00:40:50.640 align:start position:0%
submitted I was a chief legal counsel
 
00:40:51.829 --> 00:40:51.839 align:start position:0%
there any questions I'm certainly
 
00:40:53.510 --> 00:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
willing to answer them I can say and
 
00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:55.200 align:start position:0%
just concur that at the time and I
 
00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:57.060 align:start position:0%
should say before I begin I'm dealing
 
00:40:58.910 --> 00:40:58.920 align:start position:0%
with some hearing issues so if I have to
 
00:41:00.710 --> 00:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
ask questions again I apologize to the
 
00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:01.849 align:start position:0%
ask questions again I apologize to the
group

00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:01.859 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:04.140 align:start position:0%
um this is the first time that the
 
00:41:07.010 --> 00:41:07.020 align:start position:0%
commission has sought to implement the
 
00:41:08.870 --> 00:41:08.880 align:start position:0%
program of which we're now asking for
 
00:41:11.390 --> 00:41:11.400 align:start position:0%
rules to occur before that
 
00:41:13.490 --> 00:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
so we've not started the program we've
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
come in here as we're statutory required
 
00:41:18.170 --> 00:41:18.180 align:start position:0%
to test for rules uh happen
 
00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:23.750 align:start position:0%
to test for rules uh happen

thank you Mr chair this particular
 
00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
proposal we also received a conditional
 
00:41:55.010 --> 00:41:55.020 align:start position:0%
approval request for the conditional
 
00:41:57.050 --> 00:41:57.060 align:start position:0%
approval request did address a number of
 
00:41:59.150 --> 00:41:59.160 align:start position:0%
editorial comments and a couple
 
00:42:01.550 --> 00:42:01.560 align:start position:0%
substantive comments however there are a
 
00:42:04.130 --> 00:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
number of remaining comments
 
00:42:07.450 --> 00:42:07.460 align:start position:0%
primarily due to statutory
 
00:42:09.589 --> 00:42:09.599 align:start position:0%
conflicts as well as statutory
 
00:42:09.599 --> 00:42:11.510 align:start position:0%
conflicts as well as statutory
interpretation

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
interpretation
 
00:42:13.250 --> 00:42:13.260 align:start position:0%
looking at the conditional approval
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
request the first comment is a note to
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
jail car on page one regarding
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
the license requirements for a
 
00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
retailer to operate Keno on their
 
00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.970 align:start position:0%
retailer to operate Keno on their
premises

00:42:27.970 --> 00:42:27.980 align:start position:0%
premises
 
00:42:36.770 --> 00:42:36.780 align:start position:0%
the rules reflect RSA to 84 46 3.
 
00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:39.260 align:start position:0%
with regard to criminal convictions
 
00:42:41.329 --> 00:42:41.339 align:start position:0%
specifically stating no person who has
 
00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.260 align:start position:0%
been convicted of a felony or Class A
 
00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:45.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor within the previous 10 years
 
00:42:47.390 --> 00:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
which has not been annulled by a court
 
00:42:49.550 --> 00:42:49.560 align:start position:0%
or Class B misdemeanor within the past
 
00:42:51.170 --> 00:42:51.180 align:start position:0%
five years which has not been annulled
 
00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:53.700 align:start position:0%
by a court or has violated any of the
 
00:42:55.609 --> 00:42:55.619 align:start position:0%
statutes or rules governing charitable
 
00:42:57.890 --> 00:42:57.900 align:start position:0%
gambling in the past in this or any
 
00:43:01.510 --> 00:43:01.520 align:start position:0%
state shall be licensed
 
00:43:04.990 --> 00:43:05.000 align:start position:0%
to under the subdivision
 
00:43:09.530 --> 00:43:09.540 align:start position:0%
this statute is in conflict with RSA 284
 
00:43:09.540 --> 00:43:10.990 align:start position:0%
this statute is in conflict with RSA 284
45

00:43:10.990 --> 00:43:11.000 align:start position:0%
45
 
00:43:16.790 --> 00:43:16.800 align:start position:0%
5B which also prohibits an employee to
 
00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:18.839 align:start position:0%
operate keno games if such person has
 
00:43:20.569 --> 00:43:20.579 align:start position:0%
been convicted of a felony within the
 
00:43:22.910 --> 00:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
previous 10 years however it does not
 
00:43:25.609 --> 00:43:25.619 align:start position:0%
mention Class A misdemeanors
 
00:43:28.670 --> 00:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
or Class B misdemeanors but rather a
 
00:43:30.890 --> 00:43:30.900 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor involving falsehood or
 
00:43:34.990 --> 00:43:35.000 align:start position:0%
dishonesty so there may be a need for a
 
00:43:37.130 --> 00:43:37.140 align:start position:0%
legislative change with regard to those
 
00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:39.780 align:start position:0%
statutes to make them more consistent
 
00:43:42.410 --> 00:43:42.420 align:start position:0%
but at this time the commission is using
 
00:43:44.450 --> 00:43:44.460 align:start position:0%
the more restrictive statute with regard
 
00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
to that the second comment is an
 
00:43:49.130 --> 00:43:49.140 align:start position:0%
authority comment at the bottom of page
 
00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:52.500 align:start position:0%
one the rules specifically state that
 
00:43:54.530 --> 00:43:54.540 align:start position:0%
the applicant shall have the ability to
 
00:43:56.510 --> 00:43:56.520 align:start position:0%
meet Financial Obligations as
 
00:43:58.250 --> 00:43:58.260 align:start position:0%
demonstrated by an established credit
 
00:44:02.569 --> 00:44:02.579 align:start position:0%
history or a bond neither of these
 
00:44:04.790 --> 00:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
requirements are reflected in statute
 
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
there is a statute with regard to the
 
00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:08.760 align:start position:0%
commission being able to ask for
 
00:44:11.329 --> 00:44:11.339 align:start position:0%
financial information after someone has
 
00:44:13.609 --> 00:44:13.619 align:start position:0%
been licensed to operate a Kino machine
 
00:44:16.849 --> 00:44:16.859 align:start position:0%
however there is nothing in the statutes
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
regarding their ability to do this when
 
00:44:21.710 --> 00:44:21.720 align:start position:0%
an applicant is applying for this
 
00:44:25.069 --> 00:44:25.079 align:start position:0%
license so there is a bit of a
 
00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:27.060 align:start position:0%
potential issue with regard to their
 
00:44:28.849 --> 00:44:28.859 align:start position:0%
authority to do that
 
00:44:32.569 --> 00:44:32.579 align:start position:0%
the third comment on page two has to do
 
00:44:35.510 --> 00:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
with the reference to
 
00:44:40.010 --> 00:44:40.020 align:start position:0%
the license uh the applicant to sign a
 
00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480 align:start position:0%
agreement called the New Hampshire
 
00:44:44.470 --> 00:44:44.480 align:start position:0%
lottery uniform retail agreement
 
00:44:47.109 --> 00:44:47.119 align:start position:0%
retailer agreement excuse me
 
00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
this agreement which was submitted to
 
00:44:52.910 --> 00:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
our office primarily is made up of
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
requirements that are uniformly applied
 
00:45:00.470 --> 00:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
to all retailers under RSA 541a
 
00:45:02.809 --> 00:45:02.819 align:start position:0%
four this would be considered a rule
 
00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920 align:start position:0%
however the committee has taken varied
 
00:45:06.770 --> 00:45:06.780 align:start position:0%
positions on this interpretation when
 
00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
reviewing contracts like this one in the
 
00:45:08.819 --> 00:45:11.450 align:start position:0%
reviewing contracts like this one in the
past

00:45:11.450 --> 00:45:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:14.150 --> 00:45:14.160 align:start position:0%
for example this agreement also touches
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
on the sale of lottery tickets and has
 
00:45:20.990 --> 00:45:21.000 align:start position:0%
actually been in effect under uh lot 300
 
00:45:24.410 --> 00:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
the lot 300 rules however
 
00:45:26.870 --> 00:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
these are new rules and they are include
 
00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:29.160 align:start position:0%
they have included Provisions for Kino
 
00:45:30.710 --> 00:45:30.720 align:start position:0%
machines specifically so I think it's
 
00:45:32.210 --> 00:45:32.220 align:start position:0%
worth taking another look at it to
 
00:45:34.130 --> 00:45:34.140 align:start position:0%
consider whether or not these
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
requirements should be placed in the
 
00:45:38.870 --> 00:45:38.880 align:start position:0%
rule or if the commission committee
 
00:45:41.410 --> 00:45:41.420 align:start position:0%
would just determine it as a contract
 
00:45:44.630 --> 00:45:44.640 align:start position:0%
but regarding the agreement there are
 
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:46.380 align:start position:0%
also two issues with the agreement
 
00:45:50.809 --> 00:45:50.819 align:start position:0%
itself which I will touch on later
 
00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339 align:start position:0%
with regard to
 
00:45:53.339 --> 00:45:54.829 align:start position:0%
with regard to
um

00:45:54.829 --> 00:45:54.839 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:57.190 --> 00:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
two Provisions in the agreement which
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
the commission may not have the
 
00:46:04.670 --> 00:46:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:07.430 --> 00:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
the next comment is on page four it's an
 
00:46:10.190 --> 00:46:10.200 align:start position:0%
edit unclear comment about
 
00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:10.910 align:start position:0%
edit unclear comment about
um

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.530 align:start position:0%
um
the

00:46:12.530 --> 00:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:15.910 --> 00:46:15.920 align:start position:0%
applicant losing his um what
 
00:46:18.230 --> 00:46:18.240 align:start position:0%
requirements the applicant may lose
 
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:19.520 align:start position:0%
their license
 
00:46:22.670 --> 00:46:22.680 align:start position:0%
there are two statutory provisions of
 
00:46:24.829 --> 00:46:24.839 align:start position:0%
which the applicant can have their
 
00:46:27.589 --> 00:46:27.599 align:start position:0%
license revoked which are not reflected
 
00:46:30.410 --> 00:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
in the rules the first is whether or not
 
00:46:32.390 --> 00:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
they lose their liquor license after
 
00:46:34.670 --> 00:46:34.680 align:start position:0%
submitting the application is one of the
 
00:46:36.710 --> 00:46:36.720 align:start position:0%
requirements for being able to operate a
 
00:46:38.990 --> 00:46:39.000 align:start position:0%
Kino machine is to either have a liquor
 
00:46:41.030 --> 00:46:41.040 align:start position:0%
license or to sell lottery tickets on
 
00:46:45.410 --> 00:46:45.420 align:start position:0%
the premises the other is um with regard
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
to the criminal convictions
 
00:46:50.030 --> 00:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
um whether or not
 
00:46:50.040 --> 00:46:50.750 align:start position:0%
um whether or not
um

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:46:52.370 --> 00:46:52.380 align:start position:0%
someone has those criminal convictions
 
00:46:53.930 --> 00:46:53.940 align:start position:0%
and as I stated there are conflicting
 
00:46:56.030 --> 00:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
statutes with regard to what those
 
00:47:03.050 --> 00:47:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
with regard to the next comment on page
 
00:47:09.290 --> 00:47:09.300 align:start position:0%
five it's an unclear comments
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
um oh I apologize uh underneath that
 
00:47:13.910 --> 00:47:13.920 align:start position:0%
there is a Authority legislative intent
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
comment with regard to another reason
 
00:47:17.930 --> 00:47:17.940 align:start position:0%
that the licensing can have their
 
00:47:20.329 --> 00:47:20.339 align:start position:0%
license revoked the commission
 
00:47:21.650 --> 00:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
specifically put in the conditional
 
00:47:24.050 --> 00:47:24.060 align:start position:0%
approval request that if the licensee
 
00:47:26.150 --> 00:47:26.160 align:start position:0%
fails to comply with the terms of the
 
00:47:26.160 --> 00:47:27.250 align:start position:0%
fails to comply with the terms of the
agreement

00:47:27.250 --> 00:47:27.260 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:47:29.450 --> 00:47:29.460 align:start position:0%
including failure to meet the minimum
 
00:47:31.130 --> 00:47:31.140 align:start position:0%
sales requirement that could be grounds
 
00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:34.980 align:start position:0%
for revoking the license however
 
00:47:37.130 --> 00:47:37.140 align:start position:0%
uh there doesn't seem to be anything in
 
00:47:40.010 --> 00:47:40.020 align:start position:0%
the statute requiring that a licensee
 
00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:43.800 align:start position:0%
meet a minimum sales requirement on page
 
00:47:47.390 --> 00:47:47.400 align:start position:0%
two of the agreement there is a note
 
00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:48.950 align:start position:0%
two of the agreement there is a note
that

00:47:48.950 --> 00:47:48.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:47:54.050 --> 00:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
the licensee would be agreeing to meet a
 
00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.400 align:start position:0%
minimum sales volume of three thousand
 
00:47:58.490 --> 00:47:58.500 align:start position:0%
four hundred dollars per week in Keno
 
00:48:01.430 --> 00:48:01.440 align:start position:0%
sales and as I stated there's nothing in
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
the statute that specifically
 
00:48:06.890 --> 00:48:06.900 align:start position:0%
requires that of a person who has a
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
license to operate a Kino machine
 
00:48:12.290 --> 00:48:12.300 align:start position:0%
um so there is an issue with regard
 
00:48:16.970 --> 00:48:16.980 align:start position:0%
to that particular provision the other
 
00:48:20.450 --> 00:48:20.460 align:start position:0%
issue with regard to the agreement is
 
00:48:23.630 --> 00:48:23.640 align:start position:0%
found on page six of the agreement it
 
00:48:26.089 --> 00:48:26.099 align:start position:0%
says to have the keynote 603 terminal
 
00:48:28.010 --> 00:48:28.020 align:start position:0%
available and operational for the sale
 
00:48:30.829 --> 00:48:30.839 align:start position:0%
of Keno tickets and to have and to
 
00:48:33.170 --> 00:48:33.180 align:start position:0%
redeem all Keno tickets during all hours
 
00:48:35.030 --> 00:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
and days that the retailers businesses
 
00:48:40.190 --> 00:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
open RSA 248 47 ones specifically states
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
that a person can only operate a Kino
 
00:48:45.829 --> 00:48:45.839 align:start position:0%
machine between the hours of 11 A.M and
 
00:48:48.349 --> 00:48:48.359 align:start position:0%
1 a.m so that agreement may be in
 
00:48:50.510 --> 00:48:50.520 align:start position:0%
conflict with the statute if a retailer
 
00:48:52.550 --> 00:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
has hours that they're operating outside
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
of that statutory requirement
 
00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:57.710 align:start position:0%
of that statutory requirement
um

00:48:57.710 --> 00:48:57.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:01.250 --> 00:49:01.260 align:start position:0%
on page five of the rules there is
 
00:49:04.849 --> 00:49:04.859 align:start position:0%
another unclear comment uh regarding
 
00:49:04.859 --> 00:49:07.250 align:start position:0%
another unclear comment uh regarding
hearings

00:49:07.250 --> 00:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:49:07.260 --> 00:49:08.630 align:start position:0%
hearings
the

00:49:08.630 --> 00:49:08.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:49:11.630 --> 00:49:11.640 align:start position:0%
commission specifically
 
00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:12.370 align:start position:0%
commission specifically
um

00:49:12.370 --> 00:49:12.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:15.069 --> 00:49:15.079 align:start position:0%
sites RSA
 
00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
284.50 or RSA 541 a 30
 
00:49:21.910 --> 00:49:21.920 align:start position:0%
comma 3
 
00:49:25.250 --> 00:49:25.260 align:start position:0%
as applicable for a licensee who is
 
00:49:27.050 --> 00:49:27.060 align:start position:0%
requesting a hearing
 
00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:27.890 align:start position:0%
requesting a hearing
um

00:49:27.890 --> 00:49:27.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
there's an editorial comment that that
 
00:49:32.109 --> 00:49:32.119 align:start position:0%
should be citing to RSA
 
00:49:37.490 --> 00:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
541a32 but additionally RSA 28450 is
 
00:49:39.950 --> 00:49:39.960 align:start position:0%
specifically refers to re-hearings and
 
00:49:43.010 --> 00:49:43.020 align:start position:0%
does not refer to initial hearings
 
00:49:44.630 --> 00:49:44.640 align:start position:0%
um and also states that the rehearing
 
00:49:48.109 --> 00:49:48.119 align:start position:0%
shall be governed by 541 which is the
 
00:49:50.630 --> 00:49:50.640 align:start position:0%
statute which allows
 
00:49:54.530 --> 00:49:54.540 align:start position:0%
appeals to go to the Supreme Courts
 
00:49:56.750 --> 00:49:56.760 align:start position:0%
under this rule um
 
00:49:59.210 --> 00:49:59.220 align:start position:0%
the license he should be entitled to a
 
00:50:01.670 --> 00:50:01.680 align:start position:0%
hearing and then a re-hearing within the
 
00:50:04.370 --> 00:50:04.380 align:start position:0%
commission prior to be able to appeal to
 
00:50:05.809 --> 00:50:05.819 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court if the Supreme Court
 
00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:08.460 align:start position:0%
is likely not to take up an appeal that
 
00:50:11.690 --> 00:50:11.700 align:start position:0%
is not exhaustive all administrative
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
remedies so this rule is is a bit
 
00:50:16.790 --> 00:50:16.800 align:start position:0%
unclear as written it seems as though
 
00:50:18.950 --> 00:50:18.960 align:start position:0%
they need to have a site to either their
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
procedural rules for hearings or a
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
different statutory site
 
00:50:28.010 --> 00:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
also on page five there's an unclear
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
legislative intent comments once again
 
00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
commenting on the conflicting statutes
 
00:50:42.770 --> 00:50:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:44.930 --> 00:50:44.940 align:start position:0%
so do you have hopes that on a
 
00:50:46.730 --> 00:50:46.740 align:start position:0%
conditional approval that you can get
 
00:50:49.010 --> 00:50:49.020 align:start position:0%
all of this squared away
 
00:50:50.690 --> 00:50:50.700 align:start position:0%
um so I apologize if I didn't make that
 
00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
clear this is on a conditional approval
 
00:50:55.490 --> 00:50:55.500 align:start position:0%
um and as I stated the conditional
 
00:50:56.750 --> 00:50:56.760 align:start position:0%
approval did address some of the
 
00:50:59.030 --> 00:50:59.040 align:start position:0%
substantive and editorial comments um
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
however with regard to the statutory
 
00:51:02.450 --> 00:51:02.460 align:start position:0%
conflicts that's something that
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
obviously would have to go to the
 
00:51:06.470 --> 00:51:06.480 align:start position:0%
legislator to change and with regard to
 
00:51:08.750 --> 00:51:08.760 align:start position:0%
the agreement it does seem as though
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
that agreement is necessary for the
 
00:51:13.990 --> 00:51:14.000 align:start position:0%
commission to
 
00:51:16.849 --> 00:51:16.859 align:start position:0%
operate and rent out their machines have
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
their machines maintenanced and all that
 
00:51:20.089 --> 00:51:20.099 align:start position:0%
so there are certain Provisions in there
 
00:51:24.049 --> 00:51:24.059 align:start position:0%
that the committee should consider
 
00:51:25.910 --> 00:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
when you know whether or not the
 
00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:27.300 align:start position:0%
agreement can stand on its own or
 
00:51:28.549 --> 00:51:28.559 align:start position:0%
whether or not can be incorporated to
 
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
rules those are issues that really can't
 
00:51:30.780 --> 00:51:31.609 align:start position:0%
rules those are issues that really can't
be

00:51:31.609 --> 00:51:31.619 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
addressed just between OLS and so let's
 
00:51:36.890 --> 00:51:36.900 align:start position:0%
hear from the agency and tell us your
 
00:51:36.900 --> 00:51:38.390 align:start position:0%
hear from the agency and tell us your
plan

00:51:38.390 --> 00:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
plan
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
for rectifying
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
good morning my name is Valerie King I'm
 
00:51:45.170 --> 00:51:45.180 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire Lottery and I'm here
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
with me as my Superior John Conforti he
 
00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:50.220 align:start position:0%
is the chief compliance officer with New
 
00:51:52.190 --> 00:51:52.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire lottery I'm going to let John
 
00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:54.780 align:start position:0%
deal with some of the uh bigger issues
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:59.150 --> 00:51:59.160 align:start position:0%
um so we've we've addressed I believe a
 
00:52:00.890 --> 00:52:00.900 align:start position:0%
number of the comments uh that attorney
 
00:52:03.349 --> 00:52:03.359 align:start position:0%
Rickard has uh brought up
 
00:52:04.370 --> 00:52:04.380 align:start position:0%
um there are a few that we can address
 
00:52:06.049 --> 00:52:06.059 align:start position:0%
because they're statutory in nature the
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
underlying statute itself has some
 
00:52:11.510 --> 00:52:11.520 align:start position:0%
conflicts uh we have agreed and we do
 
00:52:12.829 --> 00:52:12.839 align:start position:0%
plan to
 
00:52:14.329 --> 00:52:14.339 align:start position:0%
um to work with the legislature in this
 
00:52:17.270 --> 00:52:17.280 align:start position:0%
session to address those those issues
 
00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:20.700 align:start position:0%
that's in particular with respect to
 
00:52:22.970 --> 00:52:22.980 align:start position:0%
um the criminal background requirements
 
00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:25.020 align:start position:0%
um for like who in the legislature are
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
you dealing with uh I I'll have to speak
 
00:52:31.069 --> 00:52:31.079 align:start position:0%
with uh with the director McIntyre I
 
00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:33.420 align:start position:0%
believe uh we are going to look at
 
00:52:35.690 --> 00:52:35.700 align:start position:0%
actually removing the license fee as
 
00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:36.770 align:start position:0%
actually removing the license fee as
well

00:52:36.770 --> 00:52:36.780 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:39.059 align:start position:0%
um and I know I don't know if uh
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
representative Lange if we've had this
 
00:52:42.109 --> 00:52:42.119 align:start position:0%
guy sessions with you yet I know we have
 
00:52:44.569 --> 00:52:44.579 align:start position:0%
some ongoing discussions with members of
 
00:52:46.730 --> 00:52:46.740 align:start position:0%
the legislature to get those ready for
 
00:52:48.710 --> 00:52:48.720 align:start position:0%
this session
 
00:52:50.450 --> 00:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
um but I don't know who specifically
 
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
director McIntyre is working with but I
 
00:52:55.430 --> 00:52:55.440 align:start position:0%
know that that is uh underway
 
00:52:57.170 --> 00:52:57.180 align:start position:0%
um can you get back to us online
 
00:52:59.870 --> 00:52:59.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely absolutely
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
um with respect to
 
00:53:04.849 --> 00:53:04.859 align:start position:0%
um the issue of asking for financial
 
00:53:07.490 --> 00:53:07.500 align:start position:0%
information on the front end
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
um as we we said with with
 
00:53:15.170 --> 00:53:15.180 align:start position:0%
um as we discussed with staff RC 28446
 
00:53:17.390 --> 00:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
um allows the Lottery Commission to
 
00:53:19.790 --> 00:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
review an application and either approve
 
00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
or deny it uh 284 46 identifies very
 
00:53:26.450 --> 00:53:26.460 align:start position:0%
specific reasons why we can deny an
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
application but it does not mandate that
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
we shall uh uh accept an application
 
00:53:35.630 --> 00:53:35.640 align:start position:0%
um under all circumstances and we
 
00:53:37.910 --> 00:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
interpret that to allow
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
um the commission to require some uh
 
00:53:44.450 --> 00:53:44.460 align:start position:0%
some evidence of ability to operate
 
00:53:47.210 --> 00:53:47.220 align:start position:0%
effectively that is based on the
 
00:53:49.430 --> 00:53:49.440 align:start position:0%
statutory requirements as as attorney
 
00:53:51.770 --> 00:53:51.780 align:start position:0%
Ricard said there are a number of
 
00:53:53.510 --> 00:53:53.520 align:start position:0%
financial requirements that are on a
 
00:53:56.329 --> 00:53:56.339 align:start position:0%
licensee during the terms of operation
 
00:53:58.730 --> 00:53:58.740 align:start position:0%
what we have done as an agency is
 
00:54:01.069 --> 00:54:01.079 align:start position:0%
request uh as part of the application
 
00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:02.760 align:start position:0%
review process that they demonstrate
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
evidence of financial responsibility uh
 
00:54:07.069 --> 00:54:07.079 align:start position:0%
obviously this is very important to the
 
00:54:09.829 --> 00:54:09.839 align:start position:0%
commission because a retailer is
 
00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:12.059 align:start position:0%
effectively retelling the state's
 
00:54:14.990 --> 00:54:15.000 align:start position:0%
product they hold our money
 
00:54:17.390 --> 00:54:17.400 align:start position:0%
um after a sale and before it gets paid
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
to us on a weekly basis
 
00:54:22.069 --> 00:54:22.079 align:start position:0%
so it's critically important to us uh
 
00:54:24.349 --> 00:54:24.359 align:start position:0%
that obviously that these uh entities
 
00:54:26.690 --> 00:54:26.700 align:start position:0%
are financially responsible and we
 
00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:29.040 align:start position:0%
believe that that is based on statutory
 
00:54:30.770 --> 00:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
Authority that the legislature has given
 
00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:31.730 align:start position:0%
Authority that the legislature has given
us

00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:54:34.730 --> 00:54:34.740 align:start position:0%
um in 284-48
 
00:54:36.410 --> 00:54:36.420 align:start position:0%
um that requires a number of financial
 
00:54:38.990 --> 00:54:39.000 align:start position:0%
reports and financial
 
00:54:41.270 --> 00:54:41.280 align:start position:0%
um requirements for licensees during the
 
00:54:43.849 --> 00:54:43.859 align:start position:0%
course of operation and I'm sorry if I
 
00:54:45.589 --> 00:54:45.599 align:start position:0%
could just step in very briefly and I
 
00:54:46.670 --> 00:54:46.680 align:start position:0%
apologize for not bringing this up
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
before this comment was also made on the
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
conditional approval text from 2017 and
 
00:54:53.750 --> 00:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
at that time the committee did approve
 
00:54:55.670 --> 00:54:55.680 align:start position:0%
the language at that time
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
and I should I should have started with
 
00:55:00.950 --> 00:55:00.960 align:start position:0%
this that um and we we discussed this
 
00:55:02.690 --> 00:55:02.700 align:start position:0%
with attorney Ricard
 
00:55:02.700 --> 00:55:03.410 align:start position:0%
with attorney Ricard
um

00:55:03.410 --> 00:55:03.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:55:04.910 --> 00:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
we're bringing these rules forward
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
because the legislature changed to
 
00:55:09.530 --> 00:55:09.540 align:start position:0%
expand the uh eligibility of Keno
 
00:55:12.650 --> 00:55:12.660 align:start position:0%
licensing to retail environments
 
00:55:14.690 --> 00:55:14.700 align:start position:0%
um and that's literally the only changes
 
00:55:16.309 --> 00:55:16.319 align:start position:0%
that have occurred
 
00:55:18.170 --> 00:55:18.180 align:start position:0%
um all the remaining changes that staff
 
00:55:20.270 --> 00:55:20.280 align:start position:0%
has brought up that you know obviously
 
00:55:22.250 --> 00:55:22.260 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed
 
00:55:23.930 --> 00:55:23.940 align:start position:0%
um we're underlying in the rule since
 
00:55:23.940 --> 00:55:25.910 align:start position:0%
um we're underlying in the rule since
2017.

00:55:25.910 --> 00:55:25.920 align:start position:0%
2017.
 
00:55:27.950 --> 00:55:27.960 align:start position:0%
um so this was a minor modification that
 
00:55:30.290 --> 00:55:30.300 align:start position:0%
obviously has brought up staff obviously
 
00:55:32.210 --> 00:55:32.220 align:start position:0%
has identified a number of issues that
 
00:55:34.010 --> 00:55:34.020 align:start position:0%
need to be addressed
 
00:55:35.990 --> 00:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
um with respect to the retailer
 
00:55:39.049 --> 00:55:39.059 align:start position:0%
agreement we do have a
 
00:55:41.089 --> 00:55:41.099 align:start position:0%
um what is essentially a retailer
 
00:55:41.099 --> 00:55:42.589 align:start position:0%
um what is essentially a retailer
contract

00:55:42.589 --> 00:55:42.599 align:start position:0%
contract
 
00:55:44.690 --> 00:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
um that addresses all elements of
 
00:55:47.890 --> 00:55:47.900 align:start position:0%
lottery sales and Kino is part of that
 
00:55:52.250 --> 00:55:52.260 align:start position:0%
we would suggest and uh would ask that
 
00:55:53.870 --> 00:55:53.880 align:start position:0%
the committee allow this to stand
 
00:55:56.930 --> 00:55:56.940 align:start position:0%
outside of rules because obviously this
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
is in the nature of a business agreement
 
00:56:01.490 --> 00:56:01.500 align:start position:0%
between a retailer and the lottery as
 
00:56:03.950 --> 00:56:03.960 align:start position:0%
the wholesaler of these Lottery products
 
00:56:05.329 --> 00:56:05.339 align:start position:0%
um and we need to be able to address
 
00:56:07.370 --> 00:56:07.380 align:start position:0%
issues that come up in the course of
 
00:56:09.049 --> 00:56:09.059 align:start position:0%
business quickly
 
00:56:12.170 --> 00:56:12.180 align:start position:0%
um and we obviously they are subject to
 
00:56:14.329 --> 00:56:14.339 align:start position:0%
your review because they are uh
 
00:56:17.150 --> 00:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
referenced in here however
 
00:56:19.490 --> 00:56:19.500 align:start position:0%
um we do need some level I think of
 
00:56:22.370 --> 00:56:22.380 align:start position:0%
ability to make uh changes as business
 
00:56:24.230 --> 00:56:24.240 align:start position:0%
conditions require
 
00:56:25.970 --> 00:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
um on a faster basis
 
00:56:27.410 --> 00:56:27.420 align:start position:0%
um and that's why we're asking that that
 
00:56:29.930 --> 00:56:29.940 align:start position:0%
agreement remained outside of the rule
 
00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:31.800 align:start position:0%
but only referencing the rules so that
 
00:56:34.490 --> 00:56:34.500 align:start position:0%
we're able to change those as would be
 
00:56:37.370 --> 00:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
required on a more expedited basis you
 
00:56:39.049 --> 00:56:39.059 align:start position:0%
might want to consider that when you're
 
00:56:42.470 --> 00:56:42.480 align:start position:0%
doing your legislative changes
 
00:56:43.849 --> 00:56:43.859 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
00:56:46.930 --> 00:56:46.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I have one question
 
00:56:49.730 --> 00:56:49.740 align:start position:0%
the statute limits the hours of
 
00:56:51.770 --> 00:56:51.780 align:start position:0%
operation for keno and this seems to
 
00:56:54.410 --> 00:56:54.420 align:start position:0%
imply that they can it can be played at
 
00:56:56.930 --> 00:56:56.940 align:start position:0%
the local convenience store 24 hours a
 
00:56:58.790 --> 00:56:58.800 align:start position:0%
day yes thank you representative McGuire
 
00:57:00.710 --> 00:57:00.720 align:start position:0%
I meant to bring that up on my initial
 
00:57:04.190 --> 00:57:04.200 align:start position:0%
uh discussion so uh attorney Ricard is
 
00:57:06.410 --> 00:57:06.420 align:start position:0%
correct however we actually the Lottery
 
00:57:08.329 --> 00:57:08.339 align:start position:0%
Commission controls the game the hours
 
00:57:10.190 --> 00:57:10.200 align:start position:0%
of the game the game is only available
 
00:57:15.410 --> 00:57:15.420 align:start position:0%
between 11 and 1 a.m the reference to uh
 
00:57:19.309 --> 00:57:19.319 align:start position:0%
allowing operation during all hours
 
00:57:19.319 --> 00:57:19.849 align:start position:0%
allowing operation during all hours
um

00:57:19.849 --> 00:57:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:22.910 --> 00:57:22.920 align:start position:0%
we allow the sale of tickets for so for
 
00:57:26.630 --> 00:57:26.640 align:start position:0%
example it is 9 55 we would allow
 
00:57:28.670 --> 00:57:28.680 align:start position:0%
someone to buy a ticket for the first
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
draw but the draw only occurs at 11 A.M
 
00:57:33.410 --> 00:57:33.420 align:start position:0%
and that is wholly controlled by the
 
00:57:34.849 --> 00:57:34.859 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
um so the availability of the equipment
 
00:57:40.549 --> 00:57:40.559 align:start position:0%
to sell is to sell four games that will
 
00:57:42.829 --> 00:57:42.839 align:start position:0%
occur only during those hours and to
 
00:57:45.290 --> 00:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
redeem tickets that have already won
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
um so with resp I understand
 
00:57:50.930 --> 00:57:50.940 align:start position:0%
theoretically there's a conflict but in
 
00:57:53.270 --> 00:57:53.280 align:start position:0%
reality we have complete control over
 
00:57:55.010 --> 00:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
that game they are not operating the
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
game The Lottery Commission operates the
 
00:57:58.309 --> 00:57:58.319 align:start position:0%
game they merely make it available
 
00:58:02.030 --> 00:58:02.040 align:start position:0%
through terminals in their locations
 
00:58:02.040 --> 00:58:04.670 align:start position:0%
through terminals in their locations
foreign

00:58:04.670 --> 00:58:04.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:06.650 --> 00:58:06.660 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just considering it
 
00:58:08.569 --> 00:58:08.579 align:start position:0%
was my bill House Bill 355 that created
 
00:58:09.890 --> 00:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
a little bit of this mess I'll be happy
 
00:58:11.569 --> 00:58:11.579 align:start position:0%
to take responsibility for cleaning it
 
00:58:11.579 --> 00:58:17.750 align:start position:0%
to take responsibility for cleaning it
up

00:58:17.750 --> 00:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.109 --> 00:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:27.230 --> 00:58:27.240 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry just just on the point of time
 
00:58:28.970 --> 00:58:28.980 align:start position:0%
of sale
 
00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
um why can that that not be put into the
 
00:58:34.250 --> 00:58:34.260 align:start position:0%
rules for Keno expressly I understand
 
00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140 align:start position:0%
the system I understand you control when
 
00:58:39.010 --> 00:58:39.020 align:start position:0%
they can and cannot be sold but
 
00:58:43.309 --> 00:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't that be uh stated sir
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
certainly I that's we can take that back
 
00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:49.200 align:start position:0%
and and revise that I just I wanted to
 
00:58:52.309 --> 00:58:52.319 align:start position:0%
point out for the committee that um that
 
00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:53.880 align:start position:0%
is not allowing licensees to sell
 
00:58:55.849 --> 00:58:55.859 align:start position:0%
outside of the statutory approach period
 
00:58:58.370 --> 00:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
because sales are only permitted through
 
00:58:59.690 --> 00:58:59.700 align:start position:0%
the lottery during that time period
 
00:59:01.549 --> 00:59:01.559 align:start position:0%
however we can make that editorial
 
00:59:01.559 --> 00:59:02.569 align:start position:0%
however we can make that editorial
change

00:59:02.569 --> 00:59:02.579 align:start position:0%
change
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
I think that's very important as part of
 
00:59:07.609 --> 00:59:07.619 align:start position:0%
it's a conditional approval to to do
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:59:17.930 --> 00:59:17.940 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so your earlier
 
00:59:20.329 --> 00:59:20.339 align:start position:0%
remarks with regard to being allowed to
 
00:59:23.210 --> 00:59:23.220 align:start position:0%
uh operate outside the rules with regard
 
00:59:25.690 --> 00:59:25.700 align:start position:0%
to uh
 
00:59:29.089 --> 00:59:29.099 align:start position:0%
exigencies of business practices and so
 
00:59:33.349 --> 00:59:33.359 align:start position:0%
forth and that is an awfully wide uh
 
00:59:37.789 --> 00:59:37.799 align:start position:0%
Open Door it seems to me for uh
 
00:59:40.730 --> 00:59:40.740 align:start position:0%
uh you know for oral rule making and so
 
00:59:43.789 --> 00:59:43.799 align:start position:0%
forth and uh I'm I'm a little bit
 
00:59:47.829 --> 00:59:47.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:51.289 --> 00:59:51.299 align:start position:0%
once you're operating outside the rules
 
00:59:54.049 --> 00:59:54.059 align:start position:0%
do basically do anything you want with
 
00:59:58.490 --> 00:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
that uh star of uh business requirements
 
01:00:00.849 --> 01:00:00.859 align:start position:0%
and so forth unless you can
 
01:00:04.250 --> 01:00:04.260 align:start position:0%
confirm that uh it's not nearly as
 
01:00:07.069 --> 01:00:07.079 align:start position:0%
loosey-goosey as it sounds so river is
 
01:00:08.510 --> 01:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
that respect it's not nearly as
 
01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:10.200 align:start position:0%
loosey-goosey as it sounds
 
01:00:12.950 --> 01:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
um because it is it is referenced in the
 
01:00:15.170 --> 01:00:15.180 align:start position:0%
rule it remains subject to your purview
 
01:00:17.990 --> 01:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll let my rules expert explain
 
01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:19.609 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll let my rules expert explain
exactly

01:00:19.609 --> 01:00:19.619 align:start position:0%
exactly
 
01:00:21.410 --> 01:00:21.420 align:start position:0%
um the benefits that we would have but
 
01:00:23.630 --> 01:00:23.640 align:start position:0%
you would certainly still have oversight
 
01:00:24.770 --> 01:00:24.780 align:start position:0%
over that
 
01:00:26.450 --> 01:00:26.460 align:start position:0%
um over that process
 
01:00:28.730 --> 01:00:28.740 align:start position:0%
so I I assume you're referring to the
 
01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:30.839 align:start position:0%
agreement the retailer retailer
 
01:00:33.109 --> 01:00:33.119 align:start position:0%
agreement so that is incorporated as
 
01:00:35.329 --> 01:00:35.339 align:start position:0%
part of the rule and it and it is part
 
01:00:36.950 --> 01:00:36.960 align:start position:0%
of your package
 
01:00:39.349 --> 01:00:39.359 align:start position:0%
um and it lays out the what they can and
 
01:00:41.390 --> 01:00:41.400 align:start position:0%
cannot do
 
01:00:44.030 --> 01:00:44.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure but I think he's uh so I
 
01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
believe what you're asking is it it
 
01:00:47.329 --> 01:00:47.339 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it would go through a more
 
01:00:50.089 --> 01:00:50.099 align:start position:0%
expedited process in order to change the
 
01:00:50.099 --> 01:00:51.589 align:start position:0%
expedited process in order to change the
agreement

01:00:51.589 --> 01:00:51.599 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
um so we would not have to go through a
 
01:00:54.829 --> 01:00:54.839 align:start position:0%
full rulemaking process but you would
 
01:00:56.990 --> 01:00:57.000 align:start position:0%
still have oversight a jail car would
 
01:00:58.970 --> 01:00:58.980 align:start position:0%
still have oversight over that process
 
01:01:05.030 --> 01:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:09.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:15.349 --> 01:01:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.690 --> 01:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
let's get to that
 
01:01:19.069 --> 01:01:19.079 align:start position:0%
go ahead
 
01:01:19.079 --> 01:01:19.730 align:start position:0%
go ahead
um

01:01:19.730 --> 01:01:19.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:22.609 --> 01:01:22.619 align:start position:0%
regarding the agreement if you feel that
 
01:01:23.870 --> 01:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
it's a contract and it's outside
 
01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:27.960 align:start position:0%
rulemaking then that's that's fine
 
01:01:27.960 --> 01:01:29.569 align:start position:0%
rulemaking then that's that's fine
um

01:01:29.569 --> 01:01:29.579 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:01:32.809 --> 01:01:32.819 align:start position:0%
but if you consider it to be a rule then
 
01:01:34.730 --> 01:01:34.740 align:start position:0%
if they can't incorporate it by
 
01:01:37.309 --> 01:01:37.319 align:start position:0%
reference in fact this agreement seems
 
01:01:39.530 --> 01:01:39.540 align:start position:0%
to be created and please correct me if
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
I'm wrong buy the Lottery Commission and
 
01:01:44.990 --> 01:01:45.000 align:start position:0%
you cannot incorporate by reference a
 
01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:47.220 align:start position:0%
document that's created by or be on
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
behalf of an agents but if you
 
01:01:52.370 --> 01:01:52.380 align:start position:0%
considered a contract then it's not an
 
01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:56.950 align:start position:0%
considered a contract then it's not an
issue

01:01:56.950 --> 01:01:56.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:00.109 --> 01:02:00.119 align:start position:0%
Mr do you have a question so considering
 
01:02:03.170 --> 01:02:03.180 align:start position:0%
it as a contract versus a rule in this
 
01:02:04.809 --> 01:02:04.819 align:start position:0%
in this context
 
01:02:07.609 --> 01:02:07.619 align:start position:0%
that contract I assume is still subject
 
01:02:10.789 --> 01:02:10.799 align:start position:0%
to oversight by the commission so the
 
01:02:13.370 --> 01:02:13.380 align:start position:0%
Lottery Commission itself if there was a
 
01:02:14.809 --> 01:02:14.819 align:start position:0%
change in this contract would have to
 
01:02:16.250 --> 01:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
approve that so it goes through another
 
01:02:19.250 --> 01:02:19.260 align:start position:0%
process besides shellcar the adjust any
 
01:02:21.230 --> 01:02:21.240 align:start position:0%
changes is that correct
 
01:02:22.970 --> 01:02:22.980 align:start position:0%
that's true we it would go through
 
01:02:25.250 --> 01:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
commission and we have always I I
 
01:02:27.109 --> 01:02:27.119 align:start position:0%
understand staff's comment but we have
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
always brought any changes to that
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
document because it is
 
01:02:33.650 --> 01:02:33.660 align:start position:0%
it is referenced in numerous rules so
 
01:02:35.930 --> 01:02:35.940 align:start position:0%
anytime we have edited that agreement we
 
01:02:38.569 --> 01:02:38.579 align:start position:0%
have brought it before this committee
 
01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:40.260 align:start position:0%
it's also dated
 
01:02:43.190 --> 01:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
it's referenced by date in the rule
 
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.650 align:start position:0%
it's referenced by date in the rule
okay

01:02:45.650 --> 01:02:45.660 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:02:48.049 --> 01:02:48.059 align:start position:0%
any other questions we have a motion in
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
a second
 
01:02:51.770 --> 01:02:51.780 align:start position:0%
um I I just wanted to add that with
 
01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:54.839 align:start position:0%
regard to the references for hearings I
 
01:02:56.450 --> 01:02:56.460 align:start position:0%
can make that correction as part of the
 
01:02:59.450 --> 01:02:59.460 align:start position:0%
conditional I can reference our lot
 
01:03:03.890 --> 01:03:03.900 align:start position:0%
rules that oversee hearings and make the
 
01:03:06.410 --> 01:03:06.420 align:start position:0%
correction to the RSA
 
01:03:13.309 --> 01:03:13.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:16.250 --> 01:03:16.260 align:start position:0%
any further discussion
 
01:03:18.470 --> 01:03:18.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor of the
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
conditional approval I any opposed
 
01:03:25.130 --> 01:03:25.140 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I apologize Mr chair
 
01:03:27.530 --> 01:03:27.540 align:start position:0%
who seconded that motion
 
01:03:34.309 --> 01:03:34.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:37.730 --> 01:03:37.740 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability
 
01:03:46.430 --> 01:03:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:54.589 --> 01:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:58.130 --> 01:03:58.140 align:start position:0%
uh so Mr chair this is another rule that
 
01:03:59.990 --> 01:04:00.000 align:start position:0%
we did receive a conditional approval
 
01:04:03.890 --> 01:04:03.900 align:start position:0%
request on it did address uh pretty much
 
01:04:07.130 --> 01:04:07.140 align:start position:0%
all of staff's comments except for one
 
01:04:10.750 --> 01:04:10.760 align:start position:0%
substantive comment on page one
 
01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.970 align:start position:0%
substantive comment on page one
mid

01:04:12.970 --> 01:04:12.980 align:start position:0%
mid
 
01:04:16.190 --> 01:04:16.200 align:start position:0%
401.01 L the definition for significant
 
01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:17.930 align:start position:0%
401.01 L the definition for significant
morbidity

01:04:17.930 --> 01:04:17.940 align:start position:0%
morbidity
 
01:04:20.329 --> 01:04:20.339 align:start position:0%
it's unclear how it's written it's
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
actually very confusing we had multiple
 
01:04:24.950 --> 01:04:24.960 align:start position:0%
discussions and none of us could really
 
01:04:27.230 --> 01:04:27.240 align:start position:0%
figure out what it meant so I had been
 
01:04:30.230 --> 01:04:30.240 align:start position:0%
having numerous Communications with uh
 
01:04:34.370 --> 01:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
the uh with Miss Kelly regarding the
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
definition and we have worked on a
 
01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:40.559 align:start position:0%
potential compromise for this the only
 
01:04:44.210 --> 01:04:44.220 align:start position:0%
problem is that the Midwifery Council
 
01:04:46.370 --> 01:04:46.380 align:start position:0%
has already met this month they're not
 
01:04:47.690 --> 01:04:47.700 align:start position:0%
meeting in November they won't meet
 
01:04:50.630 --> 01:04:50.640 align:start position:0%
again until December and this is
 
01:04:52.609 --> 01:04:52.619 align:start position:0%
something that would have to be run by
 
01:04:55.630 --> 01:04:55.640 align:start position:0%
them prior to the change being made
 
01:04:59.569 --> 01:04:59.579 align:start position:0%
so at this time the options of the
 
01:05:01.910 --> 01:05:01.920 align:start position:0%
committee would be to either approve the
 
01:05:04.789 --> 01:05:04.799 align:start position:0%
conditional approval as it's written
 
01:05:07.250 --> 01:05:07.260 align:start position:0%
do a preliminary objection for which
 
01:05:09.049 --> 01:05:09.059 align:start position:0%
time the council would have the
 
01:05:11.450 --> 01:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
opportunity to do a response with regard
 
01:05:13.490 --> 01:05:13.500 align:start position:0%
to fixing that or
 
01:05:13.500 --> 01:05:14.150 align:start position:0%
to fixing that or
um

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:14.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:15.950 --> 01:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
postponing this item though if it's
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
postponed it will need a waiver
 
01:05:20.510 --> 01:05:20.520 align:start position:0%
Mr Mr chair
 
01:05:23.930 --> 01:05:23.940 align:start position:0%
there is one other option that is if the
 
01:05:26.030 --> 01:05:26.040 align:start position:0%
committee initially approved it with the
 
01:05:28.970 --> 01:05:28.980 align:start position:0%
change requested but with a realization
 
01:05:31.309 --> 01:05:31.319 align:start position:0%
that the board might not agree with the
 
01:05:31.319 --> 01:05:32.690 align:start position:0%
that the board might not agree with the
uh

01:05:32.690 --> 01:05:32.700 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:34.440 align:start position:0%
language that's been worked out between
 
01:05:38.030 --> 01:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
Tina Kelly and staff in which case if
 
01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:39.900 align:start position:0%
they chose not to approve it then it
 
01:05:44.569 --> 01:05:44.579 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:46.549 --> 01:05:46.559 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the
 
01:05:48.890 --> 01:05:48.900 align:start position:0%
correct route so my preliminary
 
01:05:48.900 --> 01:05:50.270 align:start position:0%
correct route so my preliminary
objection

01:05:50.270 --> 01:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
objection
 
01:05:50.280 --> 01:05:51.410 align:start position:0%
objection
okay

01:05:51.410 --> 01:05:51.420 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:05:54.829 --> 01:05:54.839 align:start position:0%
representative hatch moves
 
01:05:58.789 --> 01:05:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:01.069 --> 01:06:01.079 align:start position:0%
to conditionally approve
 
01:06:02.809 --> 01:06:02.819 align:start position:0%
we have a second
 
01:06:05.990 --> 01:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
second by McGuire
 
01:06:08.930 --> 01:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
I think I objected any discussion
 
01:06:11.210 --> 01:06:11.220 align:start position:0%
and and the motion would include the
 
01:06:13.789 --> 01:06:13.799 align:start position:0%
language that was discussed yes yes with
 
01:06:13.799 --> 01:06:14.809 align:start position:0%
language that was discussed yes yes with
all

01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
all
 
01:06:18.289 --> 01:06:18.299 align:start position:0%
yes with all staff comments yeah
 
01:06:20.089 --> 01:06:20.099 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
01:06:27.410 --> 01:06:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:29.270 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:06:29.270 --> 01:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:06:33.349 --> 01:06:33.359 align:start position:0%
opl same electrologists
 
01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
hey um so these rules are on
 
01:06:39.109 --> 01:06:39.119 align:start position:0%
electrologists and electrology schools
 
01:06:42.289 --> 01:06:42.299 align:start position:0%
and their licensing requirements
 
01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:45.720 align:start position:0%
um on September 16th the committee voted
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
to enter a preliminary objection based
 
01:06:50.270 --> 01:06:50.280 align:start position:0%
on staff comments and as part of that
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
vote included a recommend or a request
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
that the agency provide a report on the
 
01:06:57.829 --> 01:06:57.839 align:start position:0%
mechanisms to fund activities during the
 
01:07:00.170 --> 01:07:00.180 align:start position:0%
rules expiration
 
01:07:02.690 --> 01:07:02.700 align:start position:0%
um so what you have in front of you is
 
01:07:05.569 --> 01:07:05.579 align:start position:0%
the objection response and also a cover
 
01:07:07.370 --> 01:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
letter we have a couple comments on the
 
01:07:10.789 --> 01:07:10.799 align:start position:0%
cover letter as well the agency did not
 
01:07:13.730 --> 01:07:13.740 align:start position:0%
address all of Staff comments and also
 
01:07:13.740 --> 01:07:15.190 align:start position:0%
address all of Staff comments and also
has

01:07:15.190 --> 01:07:15.200 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:07:18.410 --> 01:07:18.420 align:start position:0%
substantively amended the rule but not
 
01:07:21.069 --> 01:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
in response to OLS comments
 
01:07:23.990 --> 01:07:24.000 align:start position:0%
additionally the agency hasn't provided
 
01:07:26.870 --> 01:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
a report of mechanisms mechanisms to
 
01:07:29.329 --> 01:07:29.339 align:start position:0%
fund expenditures during the entire time
 
01:07:31.609 --> 01:07:31.619 align:start position:0%
that the rule has been expired and the
 
01:07:35.329 --> 01:07:35.339 align:start position:0%
rule has been expired since 2017. so
 
01:07:37.809 --> 01:07:37.819 align:start position:0%
that's at a high level what's going on
 
01:07:42.470 --> 01:07:42.480 align:start position:0%
with the um with the request first
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
if you look on page two of the cover
 
01:07:48.589 --> 01:07:48.599 align:start position:0%
letter you'll see a large comment at the
 
01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
top of the page
 
01:07:53.630 --> 01:07:53.640 align:start position:0%
OLS we had commented previously on the
 
01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:56.460 align:start position:0%
fact that the rule didn't have forms for
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
electrology schools to fill out and
 
01:08:01.490 --> 01:08:01.500 align:start position:0%
noted that there was also no address in
 
01:08:03.950 --> 01:08:03.960 align:start position:0%
the role for individuals to submit their
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
required information for licensing the
 
01:08:08.569 --> 01:08:08.579 align:start position:0%
rule also stipulates that the
 
01:08:10.609 --> 01:08:10.619 align:start position:0%
applicant's signature constitutes a
 
01:08:12.829 --> 01:08:12.839 align:start position:0%
certification on the information that
 
01:08:14.870 --> 01:08:14.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to submit but there's
 
01:08:17.870 --> 01:08:17.880 align:start position:0%
nothing for a person to know that the
 
01:08:20.150 --> 01:08:20.160 align:start position:0%
sheet of paper that they sign is going
 
01:08:23.829 --> 01:08:23.839 align:start position:0%
to be their certification
 
01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
so the agency's response hasn't resolved
 
01:08:30.530 --> 01:08:30.540 align:start position:0%
that issue the agency created two
 
01:08:32.269 --> 01:08:32.279 align:start position:0%
checklists and states that creating
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
forms wouldn't be a good way to expend
 
01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:38.040 align:start position:0%
their resources so despite the fact that
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
the checklists don't contain a blank
 
01:08:43.090 --> 01:08:43.100 align:start position:0%
space for the applicant to sign nine
 
01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
there is still some concern that you
 
01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
know that the applicant isn't on notice
 
01:08:50.990 --> 01:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
that their signature is going to
 
01:08:54.289 --> 01:08:54.299 align:start position:0%
constitute a certification and that the
 
01:08:57.229 --> 01:08:57.239 align:start position:0%
um the checklist may be a type of form
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
because it is asking for confirmation
 
01:09:01.849 --> 01:09:01.859 align:start position:0%
that certain things have been done by
 
01:09:03.289 --> 01:09:03.299 align:start position:0%
the applicant
 
01:09:05.809 --> 01:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
if you look on page
 
01:09:09.890 --> 01:09:09.900 align:start position:0%
three of the linked PDF you'll see this
 
01:09:14.030 --> 01:09:14.040 align:start position:0%
is a cover letter from the oplc in which
 
01:09:17.209 --> 01:09:17.219 align:start position:0%
that last paragraph there they address
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
the fees that they have collected for
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
this past year
 
01:09:25.130 --> 01:09:25.140 align:start position:0%
but as we noted the um the agency
 
01:09:26.809 --> 01:09:26.819 align:start position:0%
statement doesn't address the collection
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
of fees since the rule expired in 2017.
 
01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:31.490 align:start position:0%
of fees since the rule expired in 2017.
now

01:09:31.490 --> 01:09:31.500 align:start position:0%
now
 
01:09:36.169 --> 01:09:36.179 align:start position:0%
um these rules were over at HHS and then
 
01:09:41.150 --> 01:09:41.160 align:start position:0%
the laws of 2015 via House Bill 2 which
 
01:09:43.490 --> 01:09:43.500 align:start position:0%
was effective in 2015 transferred that
 
01:09:45.650 --> 01:09:45.660 align:start position:0%
authority over to the oplc and then the
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
rules expired in 2017.
 
01:09:51.370 --> 01:09:51.380 align:start position:0%
but um let's see
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
the next comment is on page five of the
 
01:09:59.350 --> 01:09:59.360 align:start position:0%
objection response
 
01:10:04.250 --> 01:10:04.260 align:start position:0%
here um we had requested that the agency
 
01:10:07.370 --> 01:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
delete this phrase for the purposes of
 
01:10:09.110 --> 01:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
this chapter in two different
 
01:10:11.630 --> 01:10:11.640 align:start position:0%
definitions we had initially made this
 
01:10:13.970 --> 01:10:13.980 align:start position:0%
as an editorial comment and the agency
 
01:10:15.890 --> 01:10:15.900 align:start position:0%
said that they did not want to take this
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
out because it's more clear but yet
 
01:10:20.090 --> 01:10:20.100 align:start position:0%
having this language in these two
 
01:10:22.610 --> 01:10:22.620 align:start position:0%
definitions kind of makes the other
 
01:10:24.770 --> 01:10:24.780 align:start position:0%
definitions unclear whether or not they
 
01:10:26.930 --> 01:10:26.940 align:start position:0%
actually apply to the entire chapter or
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
not because you're differentiating two
 
01:10:31.070 --> 01:10:31.080 align:start position:0%
definitions and you're saying these two
 
01:10:33.010 --> 01:10:33.020 align:start position:0%
definitions apply to the entire chapter
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
so that was the reason why we raised
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
that concern so that concern is still
 
01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:44.050 align:start position:0%
that concern so that concern is still
present

01:10:44.050 --> 01:10:44.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:46.610 --> 01:10:46.620 align:start position:0%
and the location of the definitions
 
01:10:49.130 --> 01:10:49.140 align:start position:0%
there at the beginning of chapter 1 700
 
01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
that automatically means they're
 
01:10:53.270 --> 01:10:53.280 align:start position:0%
applicable to the entire chapter
 
01:10:55.850 --> 01:10:55.860 align:start position:0%
so the language is Superfluous to say
 
01:10:59.930 --> 01:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:02.990 --> 01:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
so um I'll skip uh the comments that
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
were editorial in nature that weren't
 
01:11:07.669 --> 01:11:07.679 align:start position:0%
addressed just to save time
 
01:11:09.890 --> 01:11:09.900 align:start position:0%
um the next comment I'm just scrolling
 
01:11:11.149 --> 01:11:11.159 align:start position:0%
down here
 
01:11:16.250 --> 01:11:16.260 align:start position:0%
is on page 20 of the PDF you'll see that
 
01:11:18.830 --> 01:11:18.840 align:start position:0%
the agency has inserted some new
 
01:11:18.840 --> 01:11:19.750 align:start position:0%
the agency has inserted some new
language

01:11:19.750 --> 01:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:11:22.310 --> 01:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
that's not in response to our comment
 
01:11:23.930 --> 01:11:23.940 align:start position:0%
you may have some questions about that
 
01:11:25.850 --> 01:11:25.860 align:start position:0%
we do note that the first couple of
 
01:11:28.490 --> 01:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
changes there are most likely editorial
 
01:11:31.250 --> 01:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
but the other two are not their new
 
01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:33.130 align:start position:0%
but the other two are not their new
language

01:11:33.130 --> 01:11:33.140 align:start position:0%
language
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
the next comment I'm just scrolling down
 
01:11:39.610 --> 01:11:39.620 align:start position:0%
is on page
 
01:11:42.890 --> 01:11:42.900 align:start position:0%
25 of the PDF
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
the agency doesn't want to change the
 
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
language here to shall it says well not
 
01:11:49.669 --> 01:11:49.679 align:start position:0%
the language says the executive director
 
01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
shall notify the applicant or licensee
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
as applicable of deficiencies and
 
01:11:57.050 --> 01:11:57.060 align:start position:0%
explain that the office will not approve
 
01:11:59.030 --> 01:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
unless the deficiencies are corrected
 
01:12:02.090 --> 01:12:02.100 align:start position:0%
the agency states that this isn't a
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
requirement and so it shouldn't be a
 
01:12:08.090 --> 01:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
shall but the very next section says if
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
approval is denied pursuant to be above
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
it makes it pretty clear that that's
 
01:12:14.050 --> 01:12:14.060 align:start position:0%
going to be a shell if there are
 
01:12:16.729 --> 01:12:16.739 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and they they won't be
 
01:12:18.709 --> 01:12:18.719 align:start position:0%
approved so that language really ought
 
01:12:21.050 --> 01:12:21.060 align:start position:0%
to be shall
 
01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:24.060 align:start position:0%
um then let's see like I said I'm going
 
01:12:26.450 --> 01:12:26.460 align:start position:0%
to skip the editorial ones
 
01:12:30.950 --> 01:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
the next one is on the next page 26 the
 
01:12:33.770 --> 01:12:33.780 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page this section is where
 
01:12:37.550 --> 01:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
we begin to see the insertion of a
 
01:12:39.950 --> 01:12:39.960 align:start position:0%
checklist and
 
01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:40.490 align:start position:0%
checklist and
um

01:12:40.490 --> 01:12:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
like we said before uh it's not clear
 
01:12:47.330 --> 01:12:47.340 align:start position:0%
you know in what Manner or how or where
 
01:12:49.130 --> 01:12:49.140 align:start position:0%
an applicant is supposed to submit this
 
01:12:49.140 --> 01:12:50.410 align:start position:0%
an applicant is supposed to submit this
stuff

01:12:50.410 --> 01:12:50.420 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
01:12:52.790 --> 01:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
oplc staff did indicate in the last
 
01:12:54.530 --> 01:12:54.540 align:start position:0%
meeting that they were going to insert
 
01:12:57.590 --> 01:12:57.600 align:start position:0%
an address either into a form or onto
 
01:12:59.810 --> 01:12:59.820 align:start position:0%
the into the rule but that hasn't
 
01:13:03.350 --> 01:13:03.360 align:start position:0%
happened so neither of these checklists
 
01:13:05.270 --> 01:13:05.280 align:start position:0%
tell individuals how to submit the
 
01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:07.260 align:start position:0%
required information it doesn't provide
 
01:13:08.990 --> 01:13:09.000 align:start position:0%
any kind of contact information or
 
01:13:11.450 --> 01:13:11.460 align:start position:0%
address and so that's one issue
 
01:13:13.550 --> 01:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
and then if you look on the next page
 
01:13:15.530 --> 01:13:15.540 align:start position:0%
again the owner's signature on the
 
01:13:18.050 --> 01:13:18.060 align:start position:0%
request shall constitute certification
 
01:13:20.750 --> 01:13:20.760 align:start position:0%
so um again
 
01:13:22.910 --> 01:13:22.920 align:start position:0%
this hasn't resolved the issue of a
 
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
person having noticed that what they're
 
01:13:26.810 --> 01:13:26.820 align:start position:0%
signing be it a piece of paper or
 
01:13:29.390 --> 01:13:29.400 align:start position:0%
something that that constitutes a
 
01:13:32.090 --> 01:13:32.100 align:start position:0%
certification and that's the same issues
 
01:13:36.709 --> 01:13:36.719 align:start position:0%
again on page 28 and on page 29
 
01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
also on page 29 there are some there are
 
01:13:42.890 --> 01:13:42.900 align:start position:0%
some new language that wasn't in
 
01:13:45.830 --> 01:13:45.840 align:start position:0%
response to comment that we note as well
 
01:13:48.770 --> 01:13:48.780 align:start position:0%
let me skim through I think that those
 
01:13:55.490 --> 01:13:55.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:56.870 --> 01:13:56.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record
 
01:13:58.310 --> 01:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
Lindsay Courtney I'm the executive
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
director of The Office of professional
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
Ace insurance certification
 
01:14:03.229 --> 01:14:03.239 align:start position:0%
um before I get into the specific
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
comments I just wanted to give you a
 
01:14:06.950 --> 01:14:06.960 align:start position:0%
high level overview of how we ended up
 
01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.330 align:start position:0%
high level overview of how we ended up
here

01:14:08.330 --> 01:14:08.340 align:start position:0%
here
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
um with expired rules for several years
 
01:14:13.310 --> 01:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
obviously the committee is aware that
 
01:14:15.530 --> 01:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
the electrology advisory committee
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
transfer transferred from DHHS to a PLC
 
01:14:24.050 --> 01:14:24.060 align:start position:0%
I believe in 2018 via a house bill 2.
 
01:14:26.330 --> 01:14:26.340 align:start position:0%
um at that time and for several years
 
01:14:29.090 --> 01:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
thereafter the committee well advisory
 
01:14:31.310 --> 01:14:31.320 align:start position:0%
in nature was essentially functioning as
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
an actual committee with complete
 
01:14:35.149 --> 01:14:35.159 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority that had been the
 
01:14:36.950 --> 01:14:36.960 align:start position:0%
practice there had been deference given
 
01:14:39.169 --> 01:14:39.179 align:start position:0%
to committee members
 
01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:41.280 align:start position:0%
um in terms of moving things along and
 
01:14:42.890 --> 01:14:42.900 align:start position:0%
making rule changes there was a
 
01:14:46.070 --> 01:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
disagreement between the agency and the
 
01:14:48.350 --> 01:14:48.360 align:start position:0%
advisory committee members as to how to
 
01:14:51.050 --> 01:14:51.060 align:start position:0%
handle practical examinations which is
 
01:14:52.970 --> 01:14:52.980 align:start position:0%
why at that time the rules were not
 
01:14:56.330 --> 01:14:56.340 align:start position:0%
moved forward fast forward to 2020 the
 
01:14:59.750 --> 01:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
agency has had a change of practice in
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
theory as it relates to advisory
 
01:15:04.370 --> 01:15:04.380 align:start position:0%
committees and um
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
worked to obtain statutory changes which
 
01:15:09.709 --> 01:15:09.719 align:start position:0%
we did this past year regarding the
 
01:15:10.970 --> 01:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
administration of practical like
 
01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:13.320 align:start position:0%
practical exams and that's why now
 
01:15:15.110 --> 01:15:15.120 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding a disagreement between
 
01:15:18.350 --> 01:15:18.360 align:start position:0%
the advisory committee and oplc we moved
 
01:15:20.689 --> 01:15:20.699 align:start position:0%
these rules forward with respect to the
 
01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
first issue regarding fees I think we
 
01:15:25.610 --> 01:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
have addressed uh the committee's
 
01:15:28.370 --> 01:15:28.380 align:start position:0%
concerns while the rules has been have
 
01:15:31.490 --> 01:15:31.500 align:start position:0%
been expired since 2017 the fee was
 
01:15:33.709 --> 01:15:33.719 align:start position:0%
actually set forth in statute we did
 
01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
have clear statutory authority to
 
01:15:38.750 --> 01:15:38.760 align:start position:0%
collect fees until July 1 of this year
 
01:15:41.330 --> 01:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
when we worked with the legislature to
 
01:15:44.209 --> 01:15:44.219 align:start position:0%
remove all statutory fees since July 1
 
01:15:46.070 --> 01:15:46.080 align:start position:0%
of this year we have not collected a
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
single fee regarding electrology there
 
01:15:51.110 --> 01:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
are only approximately 60 electrologists
 
01:15:53.330 --> 01:15:53.340 align:start position:0%
so the fact that we haven't collected
 
01:15:57.169 --> 01:15:57.179 align:start position:0%
that 110 dollar biennial fee is not
 
01:16:00.709 --> 01:16:00.719 align:start position:0%
breaking the bank we are working with
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
the committee established by Senate Bill
 
01:16:04.910 --> 01:16:04.920 align:start position:0%
230 to clarify
 
01:16:07.310 --> 01:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
um or 3 30 to clarify oplc speed setting
 
01:16:09.410 --> 01:16:09.420 align:start position:0%
Authority and I do anticipate bringing
 
01:16:11.810 --> 01:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
some rules forward in the 1002s that'll
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
just collectively address uh the fee
 
01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:17.340 align:start position:0%
setting issue until that time we we will
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
be able to pay our bills particularly
 
01:16:21.229 --> 01:16:21.239 align:start position:0%
given the fact that the agency
 
01:16:23.570 --> 01:16:23.580 align:start position:0%
historically lapses significant sums of
 
01:16:26.330 --> 01:16:26.340 align:start position:0%
money to the general fund
 
01:16:28.370 --> 01:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
regarding the substantive changes I
 
01:16:30.050 --> 01:16:30.060 align:start position:0%
would disagree that any changes that
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
we've made are substantive of the bulk
 
01:16:33.649 --> 01:16:33.659 align:start position:0%
of the comments that we received from
 
01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:37.260 align:start position:0%
OLS were centered on not providing
 
01:16:39.110 --> 01:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
sufficient clarification or notice to
 
01:16:41.149 --> 01:16:41.159 align:start position:0%
the licensees any of the changes
 
01:16:43.189 --> 01:16:43.199 align:start position:0%
including the changes I think referenced
 
01:16:47.870 --> 01:16:47.880 align:start position:0%
on page 20 are are editorial in nature
 
01:16:50.570 --> 01:16:50.580 align:start position:0%
in order to provide clarification in
 
01:16:53.209 --> 01:16:53.219 align:start position:0%
response to this consensus that we
 
01:16:57.410 --> 01:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
received for the OLS Commons regarding
 
01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:00.000 align:start position:0%
um on page five for purposes of this
 
01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:01.430 align:start position:0%
um on page five for purposes of this
chapter

01:17:01.430 --> 01:17:01.440 align:start position:0%
chapter
 
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to eliminate that I I disagree
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
that it creates an issue of substance I
 
01:17:09.229 --> 01:17:09.239 align:start position:0%
do think it's editorial in nature
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
um but it for for our purposes happy to
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
eliminate that if that is the
 
01:17:15.649 --> 01:17:15.659 align:start position:0%
committee's desire
 
01:17:15.659 --> 01:17:17.090 align:start position:0%
committee's desire
regarding

01:17:17.090 --> 01:17:17.100 align:start position:0%
regarding
 
01:17:21.110 --> 01:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
um page 26 and the checklist
 
01:17:23.689 --> 01:17:23.699 align:start position:0%
in practice we have never
 
01:17:26.090 --> 01:17:26.100 align:start position:0%
had a mechanism for a school that's not
 
01:17:29.390 --> 01:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
accredited to apply to be an approved
 
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
school that's just not something that
 
01:17:34.669 --> 01:17:34.679 align:start position:0%
occurs however as part of establishing
 
01:17:37.209 --> 01:17:37.219 align:start position:0%
our internal controls
 
01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
we are became aware that we have a
 
01:17:42.410 --> 01:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
statutory obligation to have a mechanism
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
apart from relying on accreditation to
 
01:17:48.410 --> 01:17:48.420 align:start position:0%
have a pathway for someone to apply
 
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
I would be 99.9 sure that nobody will
 
01:17:55.310 --> 01:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
ever exercise that option with the 60
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
electrologists that we have
 
01:18:00.410 --> 01:18:00.420 align:start position:0%
um and the approved schools that already
 
01:18:03.410 --> 01:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
exist additionally accreditation is
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
where electrologists receive a lot of
 
01:18:07.370 --> 01:18:07.380 align:start position:0%
their continuing education and their
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
information they need to actually
 
01:18:10.790 --> 01:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
perform their job so
 
01:18:14.270 --> 01:18:14.280 align:start position:0%
um so I'm happy to create a form but
 
01:18:17.090 --> 01:18:17.100 align:start position:0%
with one staff person focusing on agency
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
rules and the need to update a lot of
 
01:18:22.850 --> 01:18:22.860 align:start position:0%
the agency rules to be reflective of our
 
01:18:25.189 --> 01:18:25.199 align:start position:0%
statutory obligations I do not think
 
01:18:27.229 --> 01:18:27.239 align:start position:0%
it's the best use of Staff resource time
 
01:18:29.750 --> 01:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
if the committee disagrees we are happy
 
01:18:32.149 --> 01:18:32.159 align:start position:0%
to go back in in Creative form
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
on the checklist issue I would note that
 
01:18:37.550 --> 01:18:37.560 align:start position:0%
there is a clear direction as to what
 
01:18:39.709 --> 01:18:39.719 align:start position:0%
one needs to do in order to apply there
 
01:18:42.709 --> 01:18:42.719 align:start position:0%
is an address listed on the checklist
 
01:18:44.330 --> 01:18:44.340 align:start position:0%
additionally and I know that the
 
01:18:46.610 --> 01:18:46.620 align:start position:0%
committee may not be aware of this but
 
01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:51.300 align:start position:0%
oplc is trying to finalize all of its
 
01:18:54.050 --> 01:18:54.060 align:start position:0%
rules in draft form and one of the draft
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
sets that we will be filing hopefully
 
01:19:00.410 --> 01:19:00.420 align:start position:0%
shortly will be the PLC 300s and those
 
01:19:02.570 --> 01:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
will be the licensing procedures not
 
01:19:04.850 --> 01:19:04.860 align:start position:0%
only for oplc but for all of the boards
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
it has taken us a little bit longer to
 
01:19:09.590 --> 01:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
obtain comments from stakeholders and
 
01:19:11.930 --> 01:19:11.940 align:start position:0%
feedback than we had thought so I had
 
01:19:13.550 --> 01:19:13.560 align:start position:0%
anticipated that those would be before
 
01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
you in some fashion prior to a
 
01:19:19.490 --> 01:19:19.500 align:start position:0%
conclusion of the PLC 700s that will
 
01:19:21.770 --> 01:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
address more specifically indiscreately
 
01:19:24.290 --> 01:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
how all applications have to be filed so
 
01:19:26.209 --> 01:19:26.219 align:start position:0%
from a practical standpoint I think that
 
01:19:28.370 --> 01:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
that will address the issue
 
01:19:31.250 --> 01:19:31.260 align:start position:0%
that said there is an address on the
 
01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:32.810 align:start position:0%
that said there is an address on the
checklist

01:19:32.810 --> 01:19:32.820 align:start position:0%
checklist
 
01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
um and then finally I did want to note
 
01:19:36.229 --> 01:19:36.239 align:start position:0%
that there was a comment from OLS
 
01:19:38.689 --> 01:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
regarding the agency's desire to not
 
01:19:42.410 --> 01:19:42.420 align:start position:0%
incorporate uh forms into the rules but
 
01:19:44.750 --> 01:19:44.760 align:start position:0%
rather to specify
 
01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
the application requirements in the role
 
01:19:49.610 --> 01:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
and I understand that there is an
 
01:19:51.010 --> 01:19:51.020 align:start position:0%
expedited way
 
01:19:53.689 --> 01:19:53.699 align:start position:0%
to modify a rule that's Incorporated by
 
01:19:55.550 --> 01:19:55.560 align:start position:0%
reverence and that may be beneficial if
 
01:19:57.830 --> 01:19:57.840 align:start position:0%
there needs to be some changes
 
01:20:00.709 --> 01:20:00.719 align:start position:0%
but as the committee is aware there has
 
01:20:03.410 --> 01:20:03.420 align:start position:0%
been a historic lack of internal
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
controls at the agency and at the board
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
level and what I have observed is that
 
01:20:12.350 --> 01:20:12.360 align:start position:0%
in for many years board support staff
 
01:20:16.010 --> 01:20:16.020 align:start position:0%
have changed and modified forms that
 
01:20:18.350 --> 01:20:18.360 align:start position:0%
they were not allowed to do so to the
 
01:20:21.890 --> 01:20:21.900 align:start position:0%
point that it was unclear what form was
 
01:20:23.630 --> 01:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
actually approved by jail car and we had
 
01:20:26.209 --> 01:20:26.219 align:start position:0%
to go to archives as a result of that
 
01:20:28.310 --> 01:20:28.320 align:start position:0%
until we have finished our profiling
 
01:20:30.050 --> 01:20:30.060 align:start position:0%
project that I've talked about
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
previously as well as establishing
 
01:20:35.450 --> 01:20:35.460 align:start position:0%
internal controls I have requested that
 
01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
all requirements be placed in rule
 
01:20:41.450 --> 01:20:41.460 align:start position:0%
because that gives us an opportunity to
 
01:20:43.850 --> 01:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
confirm that the application we are
 
01:20:46.189 --> 01:20:46.199 align:start position:0%
sending to individuals or putting on our
 
01:20:47.890 --> 01:20:47.900 align:start position:0%
website is actually what is
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
statutorially and legally required of us
 
01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:53.760 align:start position:0%
to ask so that would be the response to
 
01:20:55.370 --> 01:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
that OLS comment
 
01:20:56.990 --> 01:20:57.000 align:start position:0%
once I've you know once we feel
 
01:20:58.669 --> 01:20:58.679 align:start position:0%
satisfied that we have internal controls
 
01:20:59.930 --> 01:20:59.940 align:start position:0%
in place maybe we can move in a
 
01:21:01.790 --> 01:21:01.800 align:start position:0%
different direction but it's not at this
 
01:21:04.130 --> 01:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
time thank you
 
01:21:06.770 --> 01:21:06.780 align:start position:0%
if I could just follow up real quick so
 
01:21:09.229 --> 01:21:09.239 align:start position:0%
there is an address in the header of the
 
01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:11.040 align:start position:0%
checklist but there's nothing that
 
01:21:13.370 --> 01:21:13.380 align:start position:0%
affirmatively tells the applicant that
 
01:21:15.110 --> 01:21:15.120 align:start position:0%
they should send it there or to send it
 
01:21:17.689 --> 01:21:17.699 align:start position:0%
to the board directly
 
01:21:20.750 --> 01:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
um the there I would take issue with the
 
01:21:22.729 --> 01:21:22.739 align:start position:0%
comment that some of these amendments
 
01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
are editorial they are not for instance
 
01:21:27.470 --> 01:21:27.480 align:start position:0%
on page 27 there's an entire new
 
01:21:30.770 --> 01:21:30.780 align:start position:0%
sentence so I wouldn't think that that's
 
01:21:33.290 --> 01:21:33.300 align:start position:0%
an editorial the agency May view it as
 
01:21:35.990 --> 01:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
clean up but it certainly is a brand new
 
01:21:38.030 --> 01:21:38.040 align:start position:0%
sentence there are other places that are
 
01:21:40.370 --> 01:21:40.380 align:start position:0%
like that as well
 
01:21:44.330 --> 01:21:44.340 align:start position:0%
um and uh let's see there was
 
01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:45.050 align:start position:0%
um and uh let's see there was
um

01:21:45.050 --> 01:21:45.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:49.010 --> 01:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm not sure what statutory
 
01:21:52.370 --> 01:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
Authority the oplc is relying on as far
 
01:21:54.890 --> 01:21:54.900 align:start position:0%
as the fees are concerned
 
01:21:57.709 --> 01:21:57.719 align:start position:0%
um like we said at the outset the the
 
01:21:59.990 --> 01:22:00.000 align:start position:0%
paragraph on page three of the cover
 
01:22:01.850 --> 01:22:01.860 align:start position:0%
letter only talks about the collection
 
01:22:05.090 --> 01:22:05.100 align:start position:0%
of fees for the past year it doesn't
 
01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:07.380 align:start position:0%
talk about the collection of fees during
 
01:22:11.510 --> 01:22:11.520 align:start position:0%
the um the rules expiration I'm not sure
 
01:22:13.790 --> 01:22:13.800 align:start position:0%
what Authority they would have been you
 
01:22:15.590 --> 01:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
know collecting those fees under and I
 
01:22:16.910 --> 01:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
don't see it referenced in the cover
 
01:22:16.920 --> 01:22:18.169 align:start position:0%
don't see it referenced in the cover
letter

01:22:18.169 --> 01:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:22:21.530 --> 01:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
if I may that was addressed I agree that
 
01:22:23.930 --> 01:22:23.940 align:start position:0%
there was statutory Authority that was
 
01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:30.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:32.750 --> 01:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
okay what's the recommended action by
 
01:22:36.050 --> 01:22:36.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:38.270 --> 01:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
could request a revised
 
01:22:40.729 --> 01:22:40.739 align:start position:0%
um preliminary objection
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
um it sounds like the agency is willing
 
01:22:45.770 --> 01:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
to to take out or to change some of the
 
01:22:47.330 --> 01:22:47.340 align:start position:0%
language for instance
 
01:22:49.610 --> 01:22:49.620 align:start position:0%
um this the language for this chapter
 
01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
and the definitions the agency has noted
 
01:22:53.810 --> 01:22:53.820 align:start position:0%
a few times in testimony that they're
 
01:22:55.430 --> 01:22:55.440 align:start position:0%
willing to do a form instead of
 
01:22:57.830 --> 01:22:57.840 align:start position:0%
checklist so you may want to give them
 
01:23:00.890 --> 01:23:00.900 align:start position:0%
time to be able to do that so move
 
01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:02.630 align:start position:0%
time to be able to do that so move
second

01:23:02.630 --> 01:23:02.640 align:start position:0%
second
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
Ocean second
 
01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman yes um for a revised
 
01:23:11.149 --> 01:23:11.159 align:start position:0%
objection the agency acts has to make a
 
01:23:14.149 --> 01:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
request of committee
 
01:23:14.159 --> 01:23:16.310 align:start position:0%
request of committee
I

01:23:16.310 --> 01:23:16.320 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:23:18.470 --> 01:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
I would think that their comments that
 
01:23:20.090 --> 01:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
they're willing to make these changes
 
01:23:22.850 --> 01:23:22.860 align:start position:0%
amounts to a request and I would movely
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
accept that request Lindsay
 
01:23:27.770 --> 01:23:27.780 align:start position:0%
I I make the request consistent with the
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
committee's discussion thank you
 
01:23:30.840 --> 01:23:32.570 align:start position:0%
committee's discussion thank you
discussion

01:23:32.570 --> 01:23:32.580 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:23:34.490 --> 01:23:34.500 align:start position:0%
we have a motion on a second all those
 
01:23:35.630 --> 01:23:35.640 align:start position:0%
in favor
 
01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:36.470 align:start position:0%
in favor
aye

01:23:36.470 --> 01:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
aye
 
01:23:40.669 --> 01:23:40.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:44.290 --> 01:23:44.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.149 --> 01:23:47.159 align:start position:0%
and to wrap up today the Department of
 
01:23:56.750 --> 01:23:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:59.750 --> 01:23:59.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair starting with 2022
 
01:23:59.760 --> 01:24:02.330 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair starting with 2022
104.

01:24:02.330 --> 01:24:02.340 align:start position:0%
104.
 
01:24:04.250 --> 01:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
uh this role
 
01:24:05.930 --> 01:24:05.940 align:start position:0%
all three of the rules but this one
 
01:24:05.940 --> 01:24:07.070 align:start position:0%
all three of the rules but this one
specifically

01:24:07.070 --> 01:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
specifically
 
01:24:07.080 --> 01:24:08.630 align:start position:0%
specifically
um

01:24:08.630 --> 01:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:10.370 --> 01:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
had been brought before the committee
 
01:24:13.430 --> 01:24:13.440 align:start position:0%
previously and has been reworked a
 
01:24:16.370 --> 01:24:16.380 align:start position:0%
couple of times at this point the only
 
01:24:18.410 --> 01:24:18.420 align:start position:0%
comments remaining are some
 
01:24:21.470 --> 01:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
inconsistencies between the rule and the
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
forms that were submitted to OLS
 
01:24:27.830 --> 01:24:27.840 align:start position:0%
I have talked with attorney Wong
 
01:24:32.209 --> 01:24:32.219 align:start position:0%
regarding those inconsistencies and he
 
01:24:33.770 --> 01:24:33.780 align:start position:0%
has explained that the forms are
 
01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:34.970 align:start position:0%
has explained that the forms are
actually

01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
actually
 
01:24:38.689 --> 01:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
edited and changed and posted by a third
 
01:24:42.290 --> 01:24:42.300 align:start position:0%
party vendor So the agency's plan was to
 
01:24:44.209 --> 01:24:44.219 align:start position:0%
revise the rules get the rules approved
 
01:24:45.830 --> 01:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
first before going to the vendor and
 
01:24:47.570 --> 01:24:47.580 align:start position:0%
having the vendor make those changes on
 
01:24:49.370 --> 01:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
the forms
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
the agency is also Exempted under RSA
 
01:24:56.630 --> 01:24:56.640 align:start position:0%
541a their forms are Exempted from the
 
01:24:58.610 --> 01:24:58.620 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process so having them change
 
01:25:00.350 --> 01:25:00.360 align:start position:0%
their forms outside of this process
 
01:25:00.360 --> 01:25:02.209 align:start position:0%
their forms outside of this process
wouldn't

01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:02.219 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
 
01:25:02.219 --> 01:25:03.169 align:start position:0%
wouldn't
um

01:25:03.169 --> 01:25:03.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:25:07.010 --> 01:25:07.020 align:start position:0%
violate any statutes at this time
 
01:25:09.950 --> 01:25:09.960 align:start position:0%
with regard to the note on page 27 that
 
01:25:12.530 --> 01:25:12.540 align:start position:0%
form was eventually submitted to LS
 
01:25:14.870 --> 01:25:14.880 align:start position:0%
the comment on page 28 once again it's
 
01:25:17.270 --> 01:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
an inconsistency between the form and
 
01:25:19.790 --> 01:25:19.800 align:start position:0%
the rule this one was specifically noted
 
01:25:21.410 --> 01:25:21.420 align:start position:0%
because it had to do with the
 
01:25:21.420 --> 01:25:22.910 align:start position:0%
because it had to do with the
certification

01:25:22.910 --> 01:25:22.920 align:start position:0%
certification
 
01:25:26.209 --> 01:25:26.219 align:start position:0%
in the rule this certification stated
 
01:25:28.250 --> 01:25:28.260 align:start position:0%
that it had to be done by the majority
 
01:25:29.450 --> 01:25:29.460 align:start position:0%
of the governing board or their
 
01:25:31.250 --> 01:25:31.260 align:start position:0%
authorized designee while the form
 
01:25:33.050 --> 01:25:33.060 align:start position:0%
stated that it was the finance director
 
01:25:35.450 --> 01:25:35.460 align:start position:0%
or city manager that would certify the
 
01:25:38.390 --> 01:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
form in discussion with the agency they
 
01:25:40.250 --> 01:25:40.260 align:start position:0%
did state that they would change the
 
01:25:43.370 --> 01:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
form to reflect the rule language as
 
01:25:46.250 --> 01:25:46.260 align:start position:0%
they plan to do with their other forms
 
01:25:48.729 --> 01:25:48.739 align:start position:0%
the other comment on page 28 once again
 
01:25:51.649 --> 01:25:51.659 align:start position:0%
was specifically noted because
 
01:25:53.810 --> 01:25:53.820 align:start position:0%
of the certification
 
01:25:56.629 --> 01:25:56.639 align:start position:0%
um not being submitted with the form
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
so OLS was unable to see that
 
01:26:01.310 --> 01:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
certification in conversations with the
 
01:26:05.209 --> 01:26:05.219 align:start position:0%
agency it appears that that form it's an
 
01:26:07.669 --> 01:26:07.679 align:start position:0%
online form that when you submit the
 
01:26:07.679 --> 01:26:09.890 align:start position:0%
online form that when you submit the
information

01:26:09.890 --> 01:26:09.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:12.350 --> 01:26:12.360 align:start position:0%
after you complete the form submit the
 
01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:14.340 align:start position:0%
information then the certification page
 
01:26:15.590 --> 01:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
pops up
 
01:26:18.370 --> 01:26:18.380 align:start position:0%
so that's why it was not submitted to
 
01:26:21.350 --> 01:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
OLS I have not seen that certification
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
page as it seems difficult for the
 
01:26:26.590 --> 01:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
agency to provide it because of that
 
01:26:29.330 --> 01:26:29.340 align:start position:0%
technological Nuance but that was all
 
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:34.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
yes move to approve second
 
01:26:37.199 --> 01:26:39.590 align:start position:0%
yes move to approve second
discussion

01:26:39.590 --> 01:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:26:42.470 --> 01:26:42.480 align:start position:0%
seeing none all those in favor
 
01:26:46.850 --> 01:26:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.290 --> 01:26:51.300 align:start position:0%
next with regard to 2022 114 once again
 
01:26:52.910 --> 01:26:52.920 align:start position:0%
this is one that has been before the
 
01:26:55.550 --> 01:26:55.560 align:start position:0%
committee before it was sent back work
 
01:26:57.649 --> 01:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
has been done to it so that the only two
 
01:27:00.530 --> 01:27:00.540 align:start position:0%
remaining issues were there are a couple
 
01:27:02.510 --> 01:27:02.520 align:start position:0%
comments starting on page two regarding
 
01:27:04.970 --> 01:27:04.980 align:start position:0%
the authority legislative intent for the
 
01:27:06.830 --> 01:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
agency to
 
01:27:10.189 --> 01:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
seek or to request people submitting
 
01:27:11.750 --> 01:27:11.760 align:start position:0%
their form signed under the Pains of
 
01:27:13.490 --> 01:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
penalties of perjury as it's not
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
authorized by their statute the agency
 
01:27:15.960 --> 01:27:17.810 align:start position:0%
authorized by their statute the agency
has

01:27:17.810 --> 01:27:17.820 align:start position:0%
has
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
stated to staff that they are going to
 
01:27:22.450 --> 01:27:22.460 align:start position:0%
be seeking a legislative change
 
01:27:26.629 --> 01:27:26.639 align:start position:0%
specifically to RSA 21j12 by adding a
 
01:27:30.110 --> 01:27:30.120 align:start position:0%
new sub-paragraph D and attorney Wong
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
can correct me if this is in not being
 
01:27:36.890 --> 01:27:36.900 align:start position:0%
stated correctly but the language that
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
they're proposing is developing such
 
01:27:40.669 --> 01:27:40.679 align:start position:0%
forms or returns as may be necessary
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
which forms or returns may be required
 
01:27:44.810 --> 01:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
to be signed under the pains and
 
01:27:46.629 --> 01:27:46.639 align:start position:0%
penalties of perjury
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
staff's opinion on that language as it
 
01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:51.060 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient to address this
 
01:27:51.060 --> 01:27:52.970 align:start position:0%
would be sufficient to address this
issue

01:27:52.970 --> 01:27:52.980 align:start position:0%
issue
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
the other remaining comment on this rule
 
01:27:57.350 --> 01:27:57.360 align:start position:0%
is on page four it's the unclear comment
 
01:27:59.870 --> 01:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
with regard to the agency's use of the
 
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
word sufficient a conditional amended
 
01:28:04.610 --> 01:28:04.620 align:start position:0%
conditional approval request was
 
01:28:06.770 --> 01:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
submitted to our office reflecting
 
01:28:09.070 --> 01:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
change to this language
 
01:28:11.950 --> 01:28:11.960 align:start position:0%
specifically they would change
 
01:28:15.470 --> 01:28:15.480 align:start position:0%
sufficient number of to enough
 
01:28:19.669 --> 01:28:19.679 align:start position:0%
so that the statute or excuse me the
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
rule says enough stamps purchased within
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
the previous 90 days to pay the tax dual
 
01:28:26.990 --> 01:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
cigarettes and little cigars present on
 
01:28:29.570 --> 01:28:29.580 align:start position:0%
the premises at any given time
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
um changing that language
 
01:28:35.149 --> 01:28:35.159 align:start position:0%
in staff's opinion would address our
 
01:28:35.159 --> 01:28:36.830 align:start position:0%
in staff's opinion would address our
comments

01:28:36.830 --> 01:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
comments
 
01:28:38.689 --> 01:28:38.699 align:start position:0%
but if the committee has any additional
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
questions or wants to further explore
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
that language
 
01:28:45.830 --> 01:28:45.840 align:start position:0%
that would be something staff would be
 
01:28:47.390 --> 01:28:47.400 align:start position:0%
fine with go ahead
 
01:28:50.390 --> 01:28:50.400 align:start position:0%
uh move to approve with the
 
01:28:52.729 --> 01:28:52.739 align:start position:0%
addendum that the agency seek the
 
01:28:57.110 --> 01:28:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:59.810 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

01:28:59.810 --> 01:28:59.820 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
01:29:02.149 --> 01:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
01:29:06.470 --> 01:29:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:09.229 --> 01:29:09.239 align:start position:0%
in Equalization of assessment for cities
 
01:29:12.070 --> 01:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
towns unincorporated towns and
 
01:29:14.870 --> 01:29:14.880 align:start position:0%
unorganized places
 
01:29:17.209 --> 01:29:17.219 align:start position:0%
so staff also received a conditional
 
01:29:19.790 --> 01:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
approval request to address the comments
 
01:29:22.370 --> 01:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:29:24.050 --> 01:29:24.060 align:start position:0%
there was really only one comment with
 
01:29:26.229 --> 01:29:26.239 align:start position:0%
regard to this Rule and that is the
 
01:29:28.910 --> 01:29:28.920 align:start position:0%
incorporation of the equalization manual
 
01:29:31.090 --> 01:29:31.100 align:start position:0%
into the rule
 
01:29:33.110 --> 01:29:33.120 align:start position:0%
staff's comment was an authority
 
01:29:35.510 --> 01:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
legislative intent comment because there
 
01:29:37.790 --> 01:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
was a change in which board was actually
 
01:29:41.270 --> 01:29:41.280 align:start position:0%
preparing that Equalization manual and
 
01:29:44.990 --> 01:29:45.000 align:start position:0%
who on behalf of who they were creating
 
01:29:47.090 --> 01:29:47.100 align:start position:0%
that manual so at this time it was in
 
01:29:49.310 --> 01:29:49.320 align:start position:0%
the opinion of staff that the
 
01:29:51.229 --> 01:29:51.239 align:start position:0%
particular board was doing it on behalf
 
01:29:52.970 --> 01:29:52.980 align:start position:0%
of the agency and was administratively
 
01:29:55.490 --> 01:29:55.500 align:start position:0%
tied to the agency and therefore the
 
01:29:57.709 --> 01:29:57.719 align:start position:0%
manual should be
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
or could not be incorporated by
 
01:30:01.189 --> 01:30:01.199 align:start position:0%
reference but had to be included in the
 
01:30:01.199 --> 01:30:02.510 align:start position:0%
reference but had to be included in the
rules

01:30:02.510 --> 01:30:02.520 align:start position:0%
rules
 
01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:03.960 align:start position:0%
after looking at the conditional
 
01:30:05.570 --> 01:30:05.580 align:start position:0%
approval request
 
01:30:07.669 --> 01:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
um seems as though that would not be
 
01:30:09.890 --> 01:30:09.900 align:start position:0%
such an easy thing and between
 
01:30:12.310 --> 01:30:12.320 align:start position:0%
discussions between the agency and staff
 
01:30:15.350 --> 01:30:15.360 align:start position:0%
the better route to potentially take is
 
01:30:17.570 --> 01:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
for the agency to instead seek a
 
01:30:19.550 --> 01:30:19.560 align:start position:0%
legislative change to exempt the manual
 
01:30:21.890 --> 01:30:21.900 align:start position:0%
from having to be incorporated in the
 
01:30:25.570 --> 01:30:25.580 align:start position:0%
rules so exempting it from RSA 541a
 
01:30:28.550 --> 01:30:28.560 align:start position:0%
and after discussion with the chair and
 
01:30:29.649 --> 01:30:29.659 align:start position:0%
vice chair
 
01:30:32.510 --> 01:30:32.520 align:start position:0%
it was determined that that may be the
 
01:30:34.790 --> 01:30:34.800 align:start position:0%
better approach in that the conditional
 
01:30:37.970 --> 01:30:37.980 align:start position:0%
approval request be denied at this time
 
01:30:41.209 --> 01:30:41.219 align:start position:0%
and that the final proposal be voted on
 
01:30:44.149 --> 01:30:44.159 align:start position:0%
with one minor change requested by the
 
01:30:44.159 --> 01:30:45.470 align:start position:0%
with one minor change requested by the
agency

01:30:45.470 --> 01:30:45.480 align:start position:0%
agency
 
01:30:50.649 --> 01:30:50.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:54.110 --> 01:30:54.120 align:start position:0%
803.03 B uh the agency just asked that
 
01:30:57.110 --> 01:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
that particular sentence be changed to
 
01:30:58.669 --> 01:30:58.679 align:start position:0%
the department shall use the weighted
 
01:31:00.709 --> 01:31:00.719 align:start position:0%
mean Ratio calculated to one-tenth of
 
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
one percentage and then deleting if the
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
weighted mean ratio with a 90 confidence
 
01:31:10.370 --> 01:31:10.380 align:start position:0%
interval does not straddle 1.00 this is
 
01:31:12.530 --> 01:31:12.540 align:start position:0%
not a huge substantive change and would
 
01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
not really affect the final proposal
 
01:31:15.480 --> 01:31:16.129 align:start position:0%
not really affect the final proposal
um

01:31:16.129 --> 01:31:16.139 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:17.930 --> 01:31:17.940 align:start position:0%
so staff didn't have any comments with
 
01:31:20.090 --> 01:31:20.100 align:start position:0%
regard to that Angie's with regard to
 
01:31:21.709 --> 01:31:21.719 align:start position:0%
that agency that suggestion by the
 
01:31:21.719 --> 01:31:24.290 align:start position:0%
that agency that suggestion by the
agents

01:31:24.290 --> 01:31:24.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.930 --> 01:31:26.940 align:start position:0%
yes I recommend we conditionally approve
 
01:31:31.370 --> 01:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
the final Proposal with that uh that
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
change and
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
request the agency to request a
 
01:31:39.770 --> 01:31:39.780 align:start position:0%
legislative change to incorporate the
 
01:31:43.669 --> 01:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:43.679 --> 01:31:47.629 align:start position:0%
 
next

01:31:47.629 --> 01:31:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:47.639 --> 01:31:51.110 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

01:31:51.110 --> 01:31:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:53.689 --> 01:31:53.699 align:start position:0%
all those in favor
 
01:31:56.570 --> 01:31:56.580 align:start position:0%
any opposed
 
01:31:59.590 --> 01:31:59.600 align:start position:0%

01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:08.570 --> 01:32:08.580 align:start position:0%

01:32:20.330 --> 01:32:20.340 align:start position:0%
of that
 
01:32:22.310 --> 01:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
any other business
 
01:32:23.810 --> 01:32:23.820 align:start position:0%

01:32:25.370 --> 01:32:25.380 align:start position:0%
the conditional Amendment so this one
 
01:32:27.709 --> 01:32:27.719 align:start position:0%
was amended thank you all for your
 
01:32:32.930 --> 01:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
