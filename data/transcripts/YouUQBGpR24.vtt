HB
 
00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 align:start position:0%
1590 training regarding abuse and
 
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
neglect prot
 
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 align:start position:0%
protection uh the purpose of this is not
 
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
a hearing we do not take testimony from
 
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 align:start position:0%
the public at this it is not a hearing
 
00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 align:start position:0%
we've had the hearing on this and anyone
 
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
who has new information can get that to
 
00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:18.439 align:start position:0%
the committee as a whole by emailing us
 
00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:21.680 align:start position:0%
what we are here to do is to make an
 
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 align:start position:0%
informal recommendation to the committee
 
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 align:start position:0%
as a whole saying either yes we suggest
 
00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.230 align:start position:0%
as a whole saying either yes we suggest
further

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 align:start position:0%
legislation or no we do not suggest
 
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
further legislation on this subject
 
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 align:start position:0%
that's all we do we don't amend the bill
 
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 align:start position:0%
that we are holding 1590 we don't amend
 
00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 align:start position:0%
it we basically come on in have a seat
 
00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 align:start position:0%
pick a
 
00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 align:start position:0%
name I am suggesting that the committee
 
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 align:start position:0%
as a whole meets on Tuesday
 
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.230 align:start position:0%
as a whole meets on Tuesday
October

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:02.240 align:start position:0%
October
 
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 align:start position:0%
22nd at
 
00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 align:start position:0%
10:30 and the reason for that is there
 
00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 align:start position:0%
some people from this committee who are
 
00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 align:start position:0%
that was just a clarification of what
 
00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:47.959 align:start position:0%
I've already said we do not amend the
 
00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 align:start position:0%
bill before us we do not vote on 1590 we
 
00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 align:start position:0%
simply use it as a jum jumping off point
 
00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 align:start position:0%
to suggest either yes further
 
00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 align:start position:0%
legislation would be a good idea and
 
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
which have at it November is Bill filing
 
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 align:start position:0%
time or we suggest no we don't recommend
 
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 align:start position:0%
further legislation which you can go and
 
00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 align:start position:0%
file a bill on it anyway that's all we
 
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 align:start position:0%
do we make this as a subcommittee
 
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 align:start position:0%
recommendation that goes to the
 
00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole I am suggesting
 
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 align:start position:0%
Tuesday October 22nd at 10:30 a.m. the
 
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
reason for that is we have a few members
 
00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
of CFL that are also on the special F uh
 
00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
family thing so that way uh we can be in
 
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 align:start position:0%
the same building
 
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:43.080 align:start position:0%
sequentially we will also have retained
 
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.910 align:start position:0%
sequentially we will also have retained
Bill

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 align:start position:0%
1269 on the use of restraints in schools
 
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 align:start position:0%
and representative Petrino um chairs the
 
00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee on that once again this is
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
a work session for the subcommittee it
 
00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
is not a public hearing therefore if you
 
00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 align:start position:0%
have an update further information
 
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 align:start position:0%
something you would like us to know some
 
00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 align:start position:0%
specifics you may e email the entire
 
00:04:15.149 --> 00:04:15.159 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee and uh
 
00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:17.759 align:start position:0%
with that since I believe representative
 
00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 align:start position:0%
long you were the prime sponsor of the
 
00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400 align:start position:0%
original Bill were
 
00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 align:start position:0%
you then I would say turn your mic on
 
00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 align:start position:0%
and you may make your pitch one way or
 
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:35.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um well I'll start
 
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 align:start position:0%
off by saying I believe that this
 
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.150 align:start position:0%
off by saying I believe that this
uh

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 align:start position:0%
um I would make the recommendation that
 
00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:47.520 align:start position:0%
that this be uh would further legislated
 
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
should be considered um in that in that
 
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 align:start position:0%
there were uh questions that we heard in
 
00:04:57.469 --> 00:04:57.479 align:start position:0%
testimony from the uh Hospital
 
00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 align:start position:0%
Association that should be considered
 
00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.350 align:start position:0%
Association that should be considered
and

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 align:start position:0%
also uh with there was an there was
 
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 align:start position:0%
another entity that wanted to be
 
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 align:start position:0%
involved in this uh which I thought was
 
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
um interesting uh they wanted to be one
 
00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:19.479 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:22.520 align:start position:0%
um what training identifying what the
 
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
training would be how often would people
 
00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 align:start position:0%
need to be certified on this
 
00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:30.720 align:start position:0%
training um and
 
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 align:start position:0%
other than that I believe
 
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that was those were the
 
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
only potential issues that would have in
 
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 align:start position:0%
this uh that is Bill as you recollect
 
00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
the reason we um you and I I know both
 
00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
voted to retain it was we thought that
 
00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:53.039 align:start position:0%
there were some problems with the bill
 
00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 align:start position:0%
that we didn't know at first but came up
 
00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:58.479 align:start position:0%
and seemed to be beyond the power of
 
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.160 align:start position:0%
immediate Amendment
 
00:06:02.469 --> 00:06:02.479 align:start position:0%
is is that correct that's correct yeah
 
00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay yeah they're getting a consensus
 
00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.150 align:start position:0%
okay yeah they're getting a consensus
yep

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:06.160 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:08.759 align:start position:0%
okay anyone else wish to on the
 
00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 align:start position:0%
committee wish to speak one way or the
 
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
legislation representative sidel you're
 
00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:22.599 align:start position:0%
always backlighted I don't know whether
 
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 align:start position:0%
it's the building across the street or
 
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
your Halo probably it is her Halo thank
 
00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
you very much
 
00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
it's a little
 
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:33.000 align:start position:0%
crooked um I also think that we should
 
00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 align:start position:0%
move forward with um continued leg
 
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:37.080 align:start position:0%
legislation on this bill I think it's
 
00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:41.080 align:start position:0%
got great potential um I do agree that
 
00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:42.960 align:start position:0%
that I think it should be a more broad
 
00:06:45.589 --> 00:06:45.599 align:start position:0%
um group of people that not just so
 
00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:47.919 align:start position:0%
limited on on who has to take this
 
00:06:50.469 --> 00:06:50.479 align:start position:0%
mandatory training our First Responders
 
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:52.520 align:start position:0%
child Specialists and all of that I
 
00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:54.880 align:start position:0%
think are sadly being left out of the
 
00:06:57.230 --> 00:06:57.240 align:start position:0%
group um but I think would benefit from
 
00:06:59.350 --> 00:06:59.360 align:start position:0%
that because they do tend to interact
 
00:07:01.869 --> 00:07:01.879 align:start position:0%
with with um these children with these
 
00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:04.599 align:start position:0%
families when these issues occur and
 
00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:07.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman for letting me
 
00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
speak let me ask um representative long
 
00:07:13.029 --> 00:07:13.039 align:start position:0%
since you will not be coming back to the
 
00:07:15.589 --> 00:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
house do you have somebody who's uh
 
00:07:18.589 --> 00:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
ready to file a bill in
 
00:07:22.189 --> 00:07:22.199 align:start position:0%
November and the reason I ask is so that
 
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:25.240 align:start position:0%
questions we might raise could
 
00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:29.319 align:start position:0%
be forwarded along yeah well I mean you
 
00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:32.000 align:start position:0%
don't mention I'll be open but you know
 
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:35.120 align:start position:0%
in between door too I haven't been able
 
00:07:40.029 --> 00:07:40.039 align:start position:0%
to come up with with somebody um okay
 
00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:44.360 align:start position:0%
that I I haven't I haven't you know if I
 
00:07:46.629 --> 00:07:46.639 align:start position:0%
make the Senate they they have a
 
00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
longer time I don't know if this should
 
00:07:51.189 --> 00:07:51.199 align:start position:0%
be brought here to the house or to the
 
00:07:54.869 --> 00:07:54.879 align:start position:0%
Senate all I'm suggesting is if you are
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
aware that there is a House member who's
 
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:00.520 align:start position:0%
going to file a bill along on these
 
00:08:03.790 --> 00:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
lines that person gets in contact with
 
00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:07.240 align:start position:0%
us because we're making some suggestions
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
we can't amend the this bill but we
 
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
might speak into the next one if you
 
00:08:17.149 --> 00:08:17.159 align:start position:0%

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
work with representative long current
 
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.190 align:start position:0%
work with representative long current
representative

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:45.720 align:start position:0%
long uh on a bill that we can introduced
 
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
next year and hopefully when it gets
 
00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:51.240 align:start position:0%
over to the Senate we can work together
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
to get it passed over there too sure
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman uh chairman Pearson
 
00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:07.480 align:start position:0%
sorry um I too agree that we need to
 
00:10:10.590 --> 00:10:10.600 align:start position:0%
work on this um a bit further and bring
 
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.230 align:start position:0%
work on this um a bit further and bring
it

00:10:12.230 --> 00:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:10:16.430 --> 00:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
forward now that leaves it to
 
00:10:20.350 --> 00:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
me I have sent individual emails to
 
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:23.600 align:start position:0%
numbers of people the categories of
 
00:10:25.470 --> 00:10:25.480 align:start position:0%
which are mentioned in the bill that is
 
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:27.000 align:start position:0%
to say
 
00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:30.200 align:start position:0%
Physicians nurse practitioners
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
and physicians assistant I made sure
 
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
that I send it to Democrats as well as
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
Republicans and the answer I get back
 
00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:41.560 align:start position:0%
from everyone is this already
 
00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
mandatory uh medical ceu requirements as
 
00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:48.760 align:start position:0%
to the number of hours a physician and I
 
00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:50.880 align:start position:0%
would assume nurse practitioners and
 
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:53.760 align:start position:0%
Physicians assistants have to have each
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
year to mandate something and we don't
 
00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:00.160 align:start position:0%
know what the new bill might say
 
00:11:04.069 --> 00:11:04.079 align:start position:0%
uh does that mean it is now taking the
 
00:11:07.069 --> 00:11:07.079 align:start position:0%
place of let's say two hours of
 
00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
something else or does this mean it is
 
00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:12.800 align:start position:0%
additional yet additional
 
00:11:16.509 --> 00:11:16.519 align:start position:0%
study um that they will have to do so I
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
got some push back I also got
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
volunteered from several of them we have
 
00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:25.440 align:start position:0%
studied this and in med school along the
 
00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:28.880 align:start position:0%
way and uh everyone that said that said
 
00:11:31.870 --> 00:11:31.880 align:start position:0%
and I have also reported one or more
 
00:11:36.190 --> 00:11:36.200 align:start position:0%
people uh as here's a potential problem
 
00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:38.560 align:start position:0%
similarly I'm hesitant to tell a
 
00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:41.760 align:start position:0%
profession how to do its job we've often
 
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:44.440 align:start position:0%
said we shouldn't legislate the practice
 
00:11:47.509 --> 00:11:47.519 align:start position:0%
of medicine we've often said that here
 
00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:49.760 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it be better if the
 
00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:51.430 align:start position:0%
and wouldn't it be better if the
professional

00:11:51.430 --> 00:11:51.440 align:start position:0%
professional
 
00:11:55.310 --> 00:11:55.320 align:start position:0%
association were lobbied so that any
 
00:11:55.320 --> 00:11:56.630 align:start position:0%
association were lobbied so that any
additional

00:11:56.630 --> 00:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
additional
 
00:11:56.640 --> 00:11:57.990 align:start position:0%
additional
[Music]

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:58.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
CEUs were were from them and not from
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
us in addition there it begs the
 
00:12:08.310 --> 00:12:08.320 align:start position:0%
question a recognized accredited
 
00:12:12.629 --> 00:12:12.639 align:start position:0%
training program according to whom that
 
00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:16.600 align:start position:0%
needs to be said and then finally under
 
00:12:19.590 --> 00:12:19.600 align:start position:0%
listing uh senior medical personnel as
 
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporters everybody is a
 
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
mandatory reporter should we ask for
 
00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:29.800 align:start position:0%
example gym coaches to be required ired
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
to take this training because they see
 
00:12:35.870 --> 00:12:35.880 align:start position:0%
the kids running around in gym clothes
 
00:12:38.710 --> 00:12:38.720 align:start position:0%
and oh my gosh that sure doesn't look
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
consistent with a kid being Rough and
 
00:12:45.670 --> 00:12:45.680 align:start position:0%
Tumble that looks different uh how about
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
counselors how about others we are
 
00:12:51.350 --> 00:12:51.360 align:start position:0%
looking at what sometimes people say the
 
00:12:53.670 --> 00:12:53.680 align:start position:0%
first line of defense I might suggest to
 
00:12:55.990 --> 00:12:56.000 align:start position:0%
you we know people who their kid hasn't
 
00:12:59.509 --> 00:12:59.519 align:start position:0%
been to a doctor in een years so all the
 
00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:01.480 align:start position:0%
training in the world cannot detect
 
00:13:04.509 --> 00:13:04.519 align:start position:0%
something if the subject isn't present
 
00:13:07.629 --> 00:13:07.639 align:start position:0%
but the gym coach might be so with all
 
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:09.440 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:13:13.829 --> 00:13:13.839 align:start position:0%
objections nevertheless to me they are
 
00:13:18.430 --> 00:13:18.440 align:start position:0%
things to ponder in another bill so it
 
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:21.160 align:start position:0%
may sound to you like I would say no we
 
00:13:23.829 --> 00:13:23.839 align:start position:0%
don't need further legislation I'm
 
00:13:27.590 --> 00:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
suggesting we could use uh more fully
 
00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
informed legisl ation this is not to say
 
00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:35.440 align:start position:0%
anything against the uh Prime sponsor of
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
the bill 1590 it is to say we've learned
 
00:13:40.949 --> 00:13:40.959 align:start position:0%
a lot in the process there's new
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
information new things that help us
 
00:13:47.790 --> 00:13:47.800 align:start position:0%
detect better I'm just suggesting that
 
00:13:54.269 --> 00:13:54.279 align:start position:0%
if a uh bill is um filed in November all
 
00:13:56.030 --> 00:13:56.040 align:start position:0%
of these things that we've all said are
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
taken into account
 
00:14:03.590 --> 00:14:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079 align:start position:0%
committee seeing none we we don't vote
 
00:14:09.870 --> 00:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
actually but I we can
 
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.120 align:start position:0%
nod um or raise a thumb if you are of
 
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:18.240 align:start position:0%
the opinion uh this is worthy of of
 
00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.120 align:start position:0%
further consideration put your thumb up
 
00:14:26.389 --> 00:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
or so that looks to me like six to and
 
00:14:27.629 --> 00:14:27.639 align:start position:0%
uh if
 
00:14:30.629 --> 00:14:30.639 align:start position:0%
not put you thumb up that looks like
 
00:14:33.749 --> 00:14:33.759 align:start position:0%
none so it's the recommendation of this
 
00:14:36.110 --> 00:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
group to the children and family law
 
00:14:38.509 --> 00:14:38.519 align:start position:0%
committee as a whole which will meet on
 
00:14:42.189 --> 00:14:42.199 align:start position:0%
Tuesday October 22nd at 10:30 it is the
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
unanimous suggestion that we go
 
00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
forward and with that we
 
00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:58.030 align:start position:0%
forward and with that we
are

00:14:58.030 --> 00:14:58.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:27.949 align:start position:0%
 
finished

00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:27.959 --> 00:15:57.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

00:15:57.910 --> 00:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
