Bill 430 4 30 is uh the bill that
 
00:11:34.370 --> 00:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
requires one year of public education uh
 
00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
prior to going uh I
 
00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:43.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:46.500 align:start position:0%
all right I'm thinking all kinds of
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%

00:11:55.790 --> 00:11:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts were intended
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
to provide an alternative to public
 
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.290 align:start position:0%
to provide an alternative to public
education

00:12:03.290 --> 00:12:03.300 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.550 align:start position:0%
education
um

00:12:04.550 --> 00:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:06.060 align:start position:0%
and to
 
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:09.660 align:start position:0%
provide a resource for families to go
 
00:12:11.930 --> 00:12:11.940 align:start position:0%
someplace else
 
00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.250 align:start position:0%
someplace else
um

00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
this bill asks for children to be in
 
00:12:20.930 --> 00:12:20.940 align:start position:0%
attendance in a public school
 
00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
in order to be eligible for an EFA
 
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:26.329 align:start position:0%
in order to be eligible for an EFA
um

00:12:26.329 --> 00:12:26.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:28.550 --> 00:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
it has an exception for
 
00:12:28.560 --> 00:12:30.350 align:start position:0%
it has an exception for
um kindergarten

00:12:30.350 --> 00:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
um kindergarten
 
00:12:33.829 --> 00:12:33.839 align:start position:0%
in first grade but I think it's
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
in the true Spirit of what fourth of the
 
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
efas were intended to do
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
um so I certainly would support an art
 
00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
to pass for this
 
00:12:47.389 --> 00:12:47.399 align:start position:0%
um and I would hope that my colleagues
 
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:50.160 align:start position:0%
would vote with me
 
00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.949 align:start position:0%
would vote with me
okay

00:12:51.949 --> 00:12:51.959 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
this Bill had no support from my fellow
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
Republicans on the education committee
 
00:13:00.170 --> 00:13:00.180 align:start position:0%
this is an anti-education Freedom
 
00:13:01.970 --> 00:13:01.980 align:start position:0%
account and
 
00:13:04.069 --> 00:13:04.079 align:start position:0%
I don't like it I would move to
 
00:13:07.129 --> 00:13:07.139 align:start position:0%
inexpedient to legislate
 
00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:10.160 align:start position:0%
okay motion been made in second into itl
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:22.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:25.260 align:start position:0%
well if somebody like to say something
 
00:13:27.710 --> 00:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
else please
 
00:13:31.910 --> 00:13:31.920 align:start position:0%
I just I just want to respond to uh
 
00:13:33.970 --> 00:13:33.980 align:start position:0%
representative Heath
 
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.100 align:start position:0%
we agree that efas were created to give
 
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:40.620 align:start position:0%
parents some choice on where to send
 
00:13:41.829 --> 00:13:41.839 align:start position:0%
their kids
 
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:44.700 align:start position:0%
and that's the point of the EFA program
 
00:13:47.690 --> 00:13:47.700 align:start position:0%
when this bill comes along and tells
 
00:13:50.509 --> 00:13:50.519 align:start position:0%
parents that they can't exercise that
 
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:52.980 align:start position:0%
choice for a year that goes against the
 
00:13:54.730 --> 00:13:54.740 align:start position:0%
original intent
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
and then I would also point out that for
 
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:01.860 align:start position:0%
every year of delay and having a kid get
 
00:14:04.569 --> 00:14:04.579 align:start position:0%
into the EFA program it actually
 
00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
ironically costs the state some money or
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer some money because that's
 
00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
just another the EFA students cost the
 
00:14:18.769 --> 00:14:18.779 align:start position:0%
system less than the public school
 
00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:21.560 align:start position:0%
system does and so every year of delay
 
00:14:25.550 --> 00:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
adds a small but an incremental cost I
 
00:14:30.470 --> 00:14:30.480 align:start position:0%
think so I'm I'm comfortable voting Ito
 
00:14:32.990 --> 00:14:33.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
00:14:36.949 --> 00:14:36.959 align:start position:0%
respond first of all
 
00:14:39.710 --> 00:14:39.720 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely if a there is no
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
connection at all with a local in Lea or
 
00:14:45.290 --> 00:14:45.300 align:start position:0%
local school district
 
00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.629 align:start position:0%
local school district
um

00:14:47.629 --> 00:14:47.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.629 --> 00:14:50.639 align:start position:0%
homeschool children they used to be a
 
00:14:52.310 --> 00:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
connection to the school district there
 
00:14:53.629 --> 00:14:53.639 align:start position:0%
is no longer
 
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:56.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of the safety and well-being of
 
00:15:00.170 --> 00:15:00.180 align:start position:0%
children I think being connected to the
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
school system for one year is not a bad
 
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
idea luckily anyone who participates in
 
00:15:12.410 --> 00:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
an EFA has a number a student number
 
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:15.720 align:start position:0%
by which the EFA is provided but other
 
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
than that there is no
 
00:15:20.210 --> 00:15:20.220 align:start position:0%
are those children being served in a
 
00:15:22.310 --> 00:15:22.320 align:start position:0%
safe home are they getting the education
 
00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:25.680 align:start position:0%
are they being taught by people who
 
00:15:28.670 --> 00:15:28.680 align:start position:0%
actually have the ability to teach their
 
00:15:31.009 --> 00:15:31.019 align:start position:0%
children I just am very concerned about
 
00:15:33.650 --> 00:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
at least if they spent a year in a
 
00:15:35.810 --> 00:15:35.820 align:start position:0%
public school there would be some
 
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:37.800 align:start position:0%
connection the family would be connected
 
00:15:40.310 --> 00:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
somehow and this way
 
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
without anything in place
 
00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:45.380 align:start position:0%
we are leaving children children
 
00:15:47.629 --> 00:15:47.639 align:start position:0%
vulnerable I know that you're all in
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
favor of parents and
 
00:15:52.910 --> 00:15:52.920 align:start position:0%
in that I am old and I've seen lots of
 
00:15:55.730 --> 00:15:55.740 align:start position:0%
stuff over my years
 
00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:58.740 align:start position:0%
there are parents who do not take care
 
00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
of their children and there are parents
 
00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:02.940 align:start position:0%
who will take advantage of these
 
00:16:05.389 --> 00:16:05.399 align:start position:0%
educational Freedom accounts and will
 
00:16:07.310 --> 00:16:07.320 align:start position:0%
not educate their children to the extent
 
00:16:08.710 --> 00:16:08.720 align:start position:0%
that they should
 
00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
I in defense of children and defensive
 
00:16:14.689 --> 00:16:14.699 align:start position:0%
families in our Public Schools I think
 
00:16:16.850 --> 00:16:16.860 align:start position:0%
it's important we have a responsibility
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
to look at the safety that's our
 
00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:21.600 align:start position:0%
responsibility as state legislators and
 
00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:22.980 align:start position:0%
I think we are giving that
 
00:16:29.870 --> 00:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
thank you so um
 
00:16:36.949 --> 00:16:36.959 align:start position:0%
just a quick few remarks here I do agree
 
00:16:40.249 --> 00:16:40.259 align:start position:0%
with rep Edwards that this bill does
 
00:16:43.090 --> 00:16:43.100 align:start position:0%
have a financial impact because
 
00:16:45.829 --> 00:16:45.839 align:start position:0%
forcing kids who don't really want to be
 
00:16:47.930 --> 00:16:47.940 align:start position:0%
there to go there for a year it's not
 
00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
something that's just against you know
 
00:16:52.129 --> 00:16:52.139 align:start position:0%
patterns choices and parents rights and
 
00:16:53.629 --> 00:16:53.639 align:start position:0%
frankly I don't think it's good for the
 
00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:57.240 align:start position:0%
kid but it also increases the amount of
 
00:16:59.449 --> 00:16:59.459 align:start position:0%
funding that you know would not be
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
required If the parents were just
 
00:17:04.130 --> 00:17:04.140 align:start position:0%
allowed to exercise their choices I hear
 
00:17:06.530 --> 00:17:06.540 align:start position:0%
the concerns from representative Heath
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
in terms of Public Safety and being
 
00:17:11.870 --> 00:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
connected to the school system is a bad
 
00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:14.760 align:start position:0%
idea I will just say that those comments
 
00:17:16.610 --> 00:17:16.620 align:start position:0%
don't seem to be about DFAS in
 
00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
particular but about school choice in
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
general because any kid who is not in
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
public schools by the same you know
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
reasoning would be unsafe and you know
 
00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:28.860 align:start position:0%
those concerns are really Way Beyond the
 
00:17:31.370 --> 00:17:31.380 align:start position:0%
scope of this particular bill which is
 
00:17:34.610 --> 00:17:34.620 align:start position:0%
not attempted to you know get rid of
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
school choice so
 
00:17:40.549 --> 00:17:40.559 align:start position:0%
I believe strongly in school choice I do
 
00:17:43.310 --> 00:17:43.320 align:start position:0%
agree that there may be bad actors but I
 
00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
think there are plenty of safeguards in
 
00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:46.860 align:start position:0%
the system to allow parents who do not
 
00:17:49.430 --> 00:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
care for their children to be noticed
 
00:17:51.529 --> 00:17:51.539 align:start position:0%
and you know that's what the dcyf is for
 
00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
and so on so we do have the safety nets
 
00:17:57.169 --> 00:17:57.179 align:start position:0%
in place to take care of that so I
 
00:17:57.179 --> 00:17:58.310 align:start position:0%
in place to take care of that so I
genuinely

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:58.320 align:start position:0%
genuinely
 
00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
you know feel that those concerns are
 
00:18:02.570 --> 00:18:02.580 align:start position:0%
already addressed but I do appreciate
 
00:18:06.110 --> 00:18:06.120 align:start position:0%
and recognize them thank you
 
00:18:08.870 --> 00:18:08.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:11.220 align:start position:0%
um U.S Supreme Court has ruled many many
 
00:18:13.730 --> 00:18:13.740 align:start position:0%
times for the parents parents these kids
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
do not belong to the government they
 
00:18:17.570 --> 00:18:17.580 align:start position:0%
don't belong to the schools they belong
 
00:18:19.029 --> 00:18:19.039 align:start position:0%
to the parents they have the
 
00:18:22.970 --> 00:18:22.980 align:start position:0%
responsibility and power to control the
 
00:18:24.350 --> 00:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
education and upbringing of their
 
00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:25.190 align:start position:0%
education and upbringing of their
children

00:18:25.190 --> 00:18:25.200 align:start position:0%
children
 
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:28.380 align:start position:0%
now that's one point another point
 
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:33.360 align:start position:0%
is that in roughly 2011 we
 
00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020 align:start position:0%
worked on homeschool Bill used to be
 
00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
this used to be a red state to home
 
00:18:38.640 --> 00:18:39.950 align:start position:0%
this used to be a red state to home
school

00:18:39.950 --> 00:18:39.960 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:18:41.930 --> 00:18:41.940 align:start position:0%
and we changed that to make it a green
 
00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:42.830 align:start position:0%
and we changed that to make it a green
state

00:18:42.830 --> 00:18:42.840 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:18:45.650 --> 00:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
and I remember some of the testimony
 
00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:50.160 align:start position:0%
from Mrs Barrett from dcyf she said
 
00:18:53.029 --> 00:18:53.039 align:start position:0%
we have one report of educational
 
00:18:53.039 --> 00:18:54.230 align:start position:0%
we have one report of educational
neglect

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
neglect
 
00:18:57.049 --> 00:18:57.059 align:start position:0%
and it was unfounded that's one
 
00:18:59.510 --> 00:18:59.520 align:start position:0%
there may be more I mean you're going to
 
00:18:59.520 --> 00:19:00.650 align:start position:0%
there may be more I mean you're going to
find

00:19:00.650 --> 00:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
find
 
00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
anomalies in all
 
00:19:06.409 --> 00:19:06.419 align:start position:0%
uh these uh
 
00:19:09.710 --> 00:19:09.720 align:start position:0%
areas but the big the big thing is is
 
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:11.640 align:start position:0%
that people still and I'm surprised
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I had one uh one of our
 
00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.130 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I had one uh one of our
Representatives

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.140 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:19.020 align:start position:0%
from Milton come up to me and thank me
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
for help pass that bill and to end the
 
00:19:24.110 --> 00:19:24.120 align:start position:0%
work on that bill because it it and it
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
look we are on a path of school choice
 
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
around the country this is not just New
 
00:19:31.430 --> 00:19:31.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we're all over the country
 
00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:34.200 align:start position:0%
matter of fact I uh one other point and
 
00:19:35.870 --> 00:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
this is my last point
 
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:38.520 align:start position:0%
I was I was doing a business deal in
 
00:19:38.520 --> 00:19:39.770 align:start position:0%
I was I was doing a business deal in
Alton

00:19:39.770 --> 00:19:39.780 align:start position:0%
Alton
 
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:43.020 align:start position:0%
and next week they're going to vote
 
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:45.900 align:start position:0%
on open enrollment which is I mean
 
00:19:47.810 --> 00:19:47.820 align:start position:0%
that's that's part of the school choice
 
00:19:50.750 --> 00:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
movement and if it doesn't work then
 
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
we'll try something different but right
 
00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
now it's not I mean our academic
 
00:19:56.690 --> 00:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
achievement is going down
 
00:19:58.549 --> 00:19:58.559 align:start position:0%
and that's not good and we've got to
 
00:20:01.070 --> 00:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
figure out ways and even our own
 
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:03.660 align:start position:0%
education commissioner he homeschooled
 
00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.400 align:start position:0%
seven children and I'm sure that they're
 
00:20:11.029 --> 00:20:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:15.000 align:start position:0%
alt anybody else have any comments
 
00:20:19.610 --> 00:20:19.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:21.470 --> 00:20:21.480 align:start position:0%
as a substitute I thank you for just
 
00:20:22.850 --> 00:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
giving me a moment to be a part of the
 
00:20:22.860 --> 00:20:24.289 align:start position:0%
giving me a moment to be a part of the
conversation

00:20:24.289 --> 00:20:24.299 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:20:25.430 --> 00:20:25.440 align:start position:0%
um and I know that I don't have the
 
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
background that all of you do so humor
 
00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.549 align:start position:0%
background that all of you do so humor
me

00:20:28.549 --> 00:20:28.559 align:start position:0%
me
 
00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:30.660 align:start position:0%
um I just wanted to comment on the fact
 
00:20:34.730 --> 00:20:34.740 align:start position:0%
that when this program was launched it
 
00:20:36.710 --> 00:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
was framed
 
00:20:40.130 --> 00:20:40.140 align:start position:0%
as a way to give school choice
 
00:20:43.130 --> 00:20:43.140 align:start position:0%
to families
 
00:20:45.529 --> 00:20:45.539 align:start position:0%
enrolled in public school that did not
 
00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:48.600 align:start position:0%
have the financial ability
 
00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:53.100 align:start position:0%
to enroll their children in a private
 
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
situation or
 
00:20:58.430 --> 00:20:58.440 align:start position:0%
to I guess I remember it as in a private
 
00:20:58.440 --> 00:21:00.169 align:start position:0%
to I guess I remember it as in a private
school

00:21:00.169 --> 00:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:21:00.179 --> 00:21:01.730 align:start position:0%
school
and

00:21:01.730 --> 00:21:01.740 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:04.730 --> 00:21:04.740 align:start position:0%
a year after two years after I believe
 
00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
that there was some research done and it
 
00:21:11.510 --> 00:21:11.520 align:start position:0%
was found that 80 percent of the
 
00:21:13.789 --> 00:21:13.799 align:start position:0%
participants in the program
 
00:21:15.650 --> 00:21:15.660 align:start position:0%
had already
 
00:21:19.130 --> 00:21:19.140 align:start position:0%
chosen to put their kids in private
 
00:21:21.529 --> 00:21:21.539 align:start position:0%
school eighty percent of them were
 
00:21:24.470 --> 00:21:24.480 align:start position:0%
already private school families and they
 
00:21:26.270 --> 00:21:26.280 align:start position:0%
did not come out of the public school
 
00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:27.830 align:start position:0%
did not come out of the public school
program

00:21:27.830 --> 00:21:27.840 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:21:30.169 --> 00:21:30.179 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill is intended to
 
00:21:30.179 --> 00:21:31.549 align:start position:0%
so I think this bill is intended to
address

00:21:31.549 --> 00:21:31.559 align:start position:0%
address
 
00:21:33.529 --> 00:21:33.539 align:start position:0%
that problem
 
00:21:35.930 --> 00:21:35.940 align:start position:0%
to perhaps
 
00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:38.340 align:start position:0%
bring it back to the original intent of
 
00:21:42.230 --> 00:21:42.240 align:start position:0%
the bill as many of us understood it
 
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.789 align:start position:0%
the bill as many of us understood it
and

00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:21:46.730 --> 00:21:46.740 align:start position:0%
bring it back into
 
00:21:50.450 --> 00:21:50.460 align:start position:0%
the financial realm that we all agreed
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
on as a house when we passed the program
 
00:21:56.810 --> 00:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
and I think that this bill is a small
 
00:22:00.470 --> 00:22:00.480 align:start position:0%
step to do that and address the initial
 
00:22:03.529 --> 00:22:03.539 align:start position:0%
intent of the program which was to
 
00:22:05.270 --> 00:22:05.280 align:start position:0%
assist uh
 
00:22:07.850 --> 00:22:07.860 align:start position:0%
lower income families and give them the
 
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:09.110 align:start position:0%
lower income families and give them the
choice

00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
choice
 
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:09.770 align:start position:0%
choice
um

00:22:09.770 --> 00:22:09.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:11.210 --> 00:22:11.220 align:start position:0%
to leave the public school system
 
00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
because that is not the way the program
 
00:22:18.169 --> 00:22:18.179 align:start position:0%
has unfolded thank you
 
00:22:20.750 --> 00:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
um first you know being a sub or not you
 
00:22:26.450 --> 00:22:26.460 align:start position:0%
are sitting on the you know Division and
 
00:22:29.330 --> 00:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
you are fully qualified you know and you
 
00:22:30.830 --> 00:22:30.840 align:start position:0%
know we all have confidence that you
 
00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:32.580 align:start position:0%
know everything that you are talking
 
00:22:35.330 --> 00:22:35.340 align:start position:0%
about I wouldn't worry about that
 
00:22:37.789 --> 00:22:37.799 align:start position:0%
um but basically I just want to say
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
really quickly that I wasn't in the
 
00:22:41.450 --> 00:22:41.460 align:start position:0%
house when this bill was passed so I
 
00:22:43.490 --> 00:22:43.500 align:start position:0%
will trust everybody's Recollections in
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
regards to what you know what was said
 
00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:47.700 align:start position:0%
and what was done
 
00:22:51.350 --> 00:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
but at the end of the day this bill
 
00:22:54.649 --> 00:22:54.659 align:start position:0%
has a financial impact
 
00:22:57.049 --> 00:22:57.059 align:start position:0%
where it forces kids to go to a school
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
where the state will end up paying more
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
and they don't want to be there it's not
 
00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:02.280 align:start position:0%
just against the wheels of the parents
 
00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:04.679 align:start position:0%
but we are spending more money to
 
00:23:06.710 --> 00:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
essentially Force the kid to be in a
 
00:23:08.270 --> 00:23:08.280 align:start position:0%
school where they their parents don't
 
00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960 align:start position:0%
want it to now
 
00:23:13.669 --> 00:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
when I say Force I need to Define that I
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
agree that technically the parent could
 
00:23:17.690 --> 00:23:17.700 align:start position:0%
stay out but as we said not everybody
 
00:23:19.850 --> 00:23:19.860 align:start position:0%
can afford to step out so while some
 
00:23:21.590 --> 00:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
parents may have the word with all to
 
00:23:24.409 --> 00:23:24.419 align:start position:0%
just you know forego the efas quite a
 
00:23:26.270 --> 00:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
few of them will be there
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
I also brought up when this was
 
00:23:31.850 --> 00:23:31.860 align:start position:0%
discussed earlier that
 
00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:34.320 align:start position:0%
for example kids that move in from out
 
00:23:36.649 --> 00:23:36.659 align:start position:0%
of state and are older than first grade
 
00:23:36.659 --> 00:23:37.669 align:start position:0%
of state and are older than first grade
the

00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:23:39.649 --> 00:23:39.659 align:start position:0%
even if their parents already know that
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
public schools in other states don't
 
00:23:43.430 --> 00:23:43.440 align:start position:0%
serve their kids they will be forced to
 
00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:46.860 align:start position:0%
try again here and you know our public
 
00:23:48.890 --> 00:23:48.900 align:start position:0%
schools are excellent but again they
 
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
don't serve everybody well and I trust
 
00:23:53.330 --> 00:23:53.340 align:start position:0%
the parents who already have made a
 
00:23:55.010 --> 00:23:55.020 align:start position:0%
decision that that is not the best place
 
00:23:57.649 --> 00:23:57.659 align:start position:0%
for their children and I would urge you
 
00:24:00.890 --> 00:24:00.900 align:start position:0%
to again respect the ability of the
 
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
parents to make the right decisions for
 
00:24:05.210 --> 00:24:05.220 align:start position:0%
their kids and provide them with the
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
support they need especially since it
 
00:24:09.890 --> 00:24:09.900 align:start position:0%
you know saves the state money money
 
00:24:11.870 --> 00:24:11.880 align:start position:0%
that can be used and put back into
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
public schools I mean all those funds
 
00:24:16.070 --> 00:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
that don't you know that stop going to
 
00:24:18.289 --> 00:24:18.299 align:start position:0%
the schools it is within the you know
 
00:24:20.810 --> 00:24:20.820 align:start position:0%
this committee is prepared to greatly
 
00:24:23.270 --> 00:24:23.280 align:start position:0%
increase the financing of public schools
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
you know we're gonna put way more money
 
00:24:27.169 --> 00:24:27.179 align:start position:0%
into the public schools in this biennium
 
00:24:29.930 --> 00:24:29.940 align:start position:0%
than we would ever you know lose from a
 
00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:32.640 align:start position:0%
few kids that live out so I I would
 
00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
appreciate if we would support the ideal
 
00:24:34.559 --> 00:24:36.409 align:start position:0%
appreciate if we would support the ideal
motion

00:25:15.289 --> 00:25:15.299 align:start position:0%
motion passes Pardon Me Oh
 
00:25:17.090 --> 00:25:17.100 align:start position:0%
representative just representative
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
Edwards I apologize I I I I'm a yes
 
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:24.000 align:start position:0%
I have no idea how I managed to skip you
 
00:25:28.870 --> 00:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:31.970 --> 00:25:31.980 align:start position:0%
itl motion passes five to four okay so
 
00:25:33.590 --> 00:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
we'll be referring it out to the full
 
00:25:36.710 --> 00:25:36.720 align:start position:0%
committee at five four Ito
 
00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:40.380 align:start position:0%
the next bill is House Bill 626 which is
 
00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:42.360 align:start position:0%
the moving of administration of the
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
education Freedom accounts to the
 
00:25:48.169 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and away from
 
00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
the third party uh this being managed
 
00:25:52.970 --> 00:25:52.980 align:start position:0%
the process now
 
00:25:52.980 --> 00:25:54.169 align:start position:0%
the process now
Mary

00:25:54.169 --> 00:25:54.179 align:start position:0%
Mary
 
00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:56.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:25:59.690 --> 00:25:59.700 align:start position:0%
accountability for multiple millions of
 
00:26:01.250 --> 00:26:01.260 align:start position:0%
dollars is critical
 
00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:04.020 align:start position:0%
and if the department of Ed
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
well the department of Ed has been
 
00:26:08.450 --> 00:26:08.460 align:start position:0%
established and set up for years and
 
00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.470 align:start position:0%
established and set up for years and
years

00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
years
 
00:26:13.070 --> 00:26:13.080 align:start position:0%
um to do just that they administer they
 
00:26:16.070 --> 00:26:16.080 align:start position:0%
have their funds audited there's High
 
00:26:17.750 --> 00:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
accountability from the federal
 
00:26:19.549 --> 00:26:19.559 align:start position:0%
government as well as from state
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
government the LBA has been constant
 
00:26:24.950 --> 00:26:24.960 align:start position:0%
visitors at the Department of Education
 
00:26:28.010 --> 00:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
they are reliable accountable
 
00:26:31.310 --> 00:26:31.320 align:start position:0%
if the Department of Education were to
 
00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:34.200 align:start position:0%
become responsible for the efas they
 
00:26:39.169 --> 00:26:39.179 align:start position:0%
could always contract out that to the
 
00:26:39.179 --> 00:26:40.010 align:start position:0%
could always contract out that to the
um

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:40.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:43.970 --> 00:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
agency that is currently doing that
 
00:26:47.210 --> 00:26:47.220 align:start position:0%
then at least there'd be
 
00:26:49.909 --> 00:26:49.919 align:start position:0%
an oversight of these dollars I think
 
00:26:49.919 --> 00:26:50.950 align:start position:0%
an oversight of these dollars I think
it's

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:50.960 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:26:54.350 --> 00:26:54.360 align:start position:0%
responsible it's reliable
 
00:26:57.230 --> 00:26:57.240 align:start position:0%
I think we have some responsibility to
 
00:26:59.750 --> 00:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
our taxpayers for the amount of money
 
00:27:01.850 --> 00:27:01.860 align:start position:0%
that is going out
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
with basically minimal oversight of how
 
00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's being spent where it's going what
 
00:27:10.010 --> 00:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
are the results
 
00:27:12.950 --> 00:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
what's the accountability so I would ask
 
00:27:15.409 --> 00:27:15.419 align:start position:0%
that you consider this bill because I
 
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:18.840 align:start position:0%
think its intentions are quite
 
00:27:18.840 --> 00:27:20.630 align:start position:0%
think its intentions are quite
viable

00:27:20.630 --> 00:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
viable
 
00:27:23.870 --> 00:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
as former Deputy Commissioner I know how
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
hard people work at the department of Ed
 
00:27:28.310 --> 00:27:28.320 align:start position:0%
we all know Caitlin we know how
 
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
responsible she is we've watched they
 
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:32.340 align:start position:0%
come to us all the time they talk about
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
how funds are being spent we rely on
 
00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:36.960 align:start position:0%
what they tell us
 
00:27:39.649 --> 00:27:39.659 align:start position:0%
we don't have that same sense of
 
00:27:39.659 --> 00:27:41.029 align:start position:0%
we don't have that same sense of
authority

00:27:41.029 --> 00:27:41.039 align:start position:0%
authority
 
00:27:43.909 --> 00:27:43.919 align:start position:0%
over of the scholarship organization
 
00:27:45.769 --> 00:27:45.779 align:start position:0%
so what I would ask that you would
 
00:27:50.450 --> 00:27:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:52.370 align:start position:0%
 
man

00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:52.380 align:start position:0%
man
 
00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:53.570 align:start position:0%
man
um

00:27:53.570 --> 00:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:57.710 --> 00:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
there was a surprise how many people
 
00:28:00.110 --> 00:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
applied for this program far more than
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
we had anticipated and yet
 
00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:05.460 align:start position:0%
the organization taking care of that
 
00:28:09.289 --> 00:28:09.299 align:start position:0%
never seemed to raise any oh oh me or
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
anything else they took care of it got
 
00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:13.380 align:start position:0%
it done got the job done
 
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:16.140 align:start position:0%
maybe they have more flexibility than
 
00:28:17.690 --> 00:28:17.700 align:start position:0%
than the
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
State program that they'd have to come
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
back to West for an increase in
 
00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
something so even though there was an
 
00:28:25.610 --> 00:28:25.620 align:start position:0%
unexpected increase we never heard any
 
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:28.320 align:start position:0%
anything about a problem or anybody that
 
00:28:32.029 --> 00:28:32.039 align:start position:0%
didn't get the paperwork done on time so
 
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:35.100 align:start position:0%
again I go back to the fact that none of
 
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:37.500 align:start position:0%
my Republican colleagues on the
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
education committee supported this bill
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
neither do I so I would move itl
 
00:28:45.360 --> 00:28:46.310 align:start position:0%
neither do I so I would move itl
okay

00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:48.649 --> 00:28:48.659 align:start position:0%
for a second
 
00:28:54.710 --> 00:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.510 --> 00:28:56.520 align:start position:0%
yeah I just would like to add that it
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
seems to me that it's fiscally
 
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:00.240 align:start position:0%
responsible to bring it in-house and in
 
00:29:01.850 --> 00:29:01.860 align:start position:0%
terms of accountability it's much easier
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
to see what is going on in the program
 
00:29:05.510 --> 00:29:05.520 align:start position:0%
if it is in-house
 
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
um apropos what it would require or you
 
00:29:10.669 --> 00:29:10.679 align:start position:0%
know what department of education might
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
need it seems to me it'd be more than
 
00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
reasonable and easy from that 10 million
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
dollars if you took 2 million to hire
 
00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:19.140 align:start position:0%
two staff people if you needed
 
00:29:20.990 --> 00:29:21.000 align:start position:0%
additional people to do this and it is
 
00:29:22.909 --> 00:29:22.919 align:start position:0%
far less expensive than the 10 million
 
00:29:24.529 --> 00:29:24.539 align:start position:0%
dollars that went out this last year
 
00:29:27.649 --> 00:29:27.659 align:start position:0%
without us really having any idea of how
 
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760 align:start position:0%
it is you know how that mechanism is
 
00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:31.620 align:start position:0%
working it would just be so much more
 
00:29:33.649 --> 00:29:33.659 align:start position:0%
transparent and I really strongly think
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
that it's fiscally responsible to do it
 
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:37.140 align:start position:0%
in-house within the Department of
 
00:29:38.690 --> 00:29:38.700 align:start position:0%
Education so I would urge you know
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
considering that it's a small change but
 
00:29:42.649 --> 00:29:42.659 align:start position:0%
I think it would make a big deal a big
 
00:29:45.529 --> 00:29:45.539 align:start position:0%
change in terms of how uh the the
 
00:29:47.630 --> 00:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
program is administered in New Hampshire
 
00:29:49.070 --> 00:29:49.080 align:start position:0%
for the benefit of the New Hampshire
 
00:29:51.470 --> 00:29:51.480 align:start position:0%
people I am very big on the fiscal
 
00:29:53.029 --> 00:29:53.039 align:start position:0%
responsibility of it and the
 
00:29:55.130 --> 00:29:55.140 align:start position:0%
accountability and the transparency that
 
00:29:56.930 --> 00:29:56.940 align:start position:0%
it would provide and you know it would
 
00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:58.740 align:start position:0%
we could do that for a few million as
 
00:30:00.230 --> 00:30:00.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to the 10 million that
 
00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
continually goes out or however much it
 
00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:04.320 align:start position:0%
will be the 10 percent is a hefty charge
 
00:30:06.889 --> 00:30:06.899 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
00:30:06.899 --> 00:30:08.090 align:start position:0%
in my mind
right

00:30:08.090 --> 00:30:08.100 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
um Kate just took care of it okay
 
00:30:13.909 --> 00:30:13.919 align:start position:0%
comment thank you thank you Mr chairman
 
00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:16.500 align:start position:0%
thank you I agree that 10 million is a
 
00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:19.980 align:start position:0%
hefty charge but I genuinely don't see a
 
00:30:22.010 --> 00:30:22.020 align:start position:0%
reason why that charge was actually
 
00:30:24.409 --> 00:30:24.419 align:start position:0%
happened I know the current loss is up
 
00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:26.820 align:start position:0%
to 10 percent but it is within the
 
00:30:29.330 --> 00:30:29.340 align:start position:0%
ability of this committee to adjust that
 
00:30:32.389 --> 00:30:32.399 align:start position:0%
and uh I think that we may be able to
 
00:30:34.789 --> 00:30:34.799 align:start position:0%
save more money by engaging with a
 
00:30:36.710 --> 00:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
private agency and having them control
 
00:30:38.450 --> 00:30:38.460 align:start position:0%
the cost thoroughly then we would be
 
00:30:40.010 --> 00:30:40.020 align:start position:0%
able to do that with the Department of
 
00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.330 align:start position:0%
able to do that with the Department of
Education

00:30:41.330 --> 00:30:41.340 align:start position:0%
Education
 
00:30:44.389 --> 00:30:44.399 align:start position:0%
it is also much much harder to uh if we
 
00:30:46.909 --> 00:30:46.919 align:start position:0%
ever need to you know
 
00:30:49.250 --> 00:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
reduce the expenses it's easier to
 
00:30:51.289 --> 00:30:51.299 align:start position:0%
frankly cut the fee that you pay to a
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
private agency by putting it out to bid
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
or finding other people than it is to
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
ask the Department of Education to
 
00:30:59.510 --> 00:30:59.520 align:start position:0%
adjust those things
 
00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:01.620 align:start position:0%
Mr chair yes I just would like to
 
00:31:05.389 --> 00:31:05.399 align:start position:0%
mention that there was never an RFP sent
 
00:31:05.399 --> 00:31:06.470 align:start position:0%
mention that there was never an RFP sent
out

00:31:06.470 --> 00:31:06.480 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:09.960 align:start position:0%
to anyone this was just in statute that
 
00:31:11.810 --> 00:31:11.820 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization would take
 
00:31:11.820 --> 00:31:13.250 align:start position:0%
the scholarship organization would take
this

00:31:13.250 --> 00:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:31:17.769 --> 00:31:17.779 align:start position:0%
in terms of the representatives comment
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
that might be something that we might
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
want to consider maybe we should take
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
change from 10 to 5
 
00:31:27.289 --> 00:31:27.299 align:start position:0%
um it's been established so they
 
00:31:29.630 --> 00:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
probably don't need that 10 of every
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
single EFA anymore so maybe we should
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
consider that I don't know if if we want
 
00:31:35.870 --> 00:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
to ask Mickey if he could draw up an
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
amendment to that effect
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
I think before we take any steps like
 
00:31:42.590 --> 00:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
that we ought to have parties in to
 
00:31:44.510 --> 00:31:44.520 align:start position:0%
discuss it Mary
 
00:31:47.630 --> 00:31:47.640 align:start position:0%
if you're an a for trying all right
 
00:31:50.750 --> 00:31:50.760 align:start position:0%
five stars on that one uh I don't
 
00:31:52.669 --> 00:31:52.679 align:start position:0%
remember remember any comments from the
 
00:31:55.070 --> 00:31:55.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education on this bill or
 
00:31:57.710 --> 00:31:57.720 align:start position:0%
any support of it and if they if they
 
00:31:59.330 --> 00:31:59.340 align:start position:0%
didn't like the way it was going I
 
00:32:00.830 --> 00:32:00.840 align:start position:0%
thought think they should come to any
 
00:32:02.930 --> 00:32:02.940 align:start position:0%
one of us and ask us to put in a bill to
 
00:32:06.049 --> 00:32:06.059 align:start position:0%
change it and the other thing that I've
 
00:32:08.930 --> 00:32:08.940 align:start position:0%
noted through the years is that
 
00:32:10.789 --> 00:32:10.799 align:start position:0%
within the department
 
00:32:13.909 --> 00:32:13.919 align:start position:0%
there was except for under this present
 
00:32:16.070 --> 00:32:16.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner there was very little
 
00:32:18.590 --> 00:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
support of any alteration of the public
 
00:32:22.430 --> 00:32:22.440 align:start position:0%
schools and I remember at one point
 
00:32:25.430 --> 00:32:25.440 align:start position:0%
when we first put in charter schools and
 
00:32:27.409 --> 00:32:27.419 align:start position:0%
we were reviewing the budget in the
 
00:32:29.149 --> 00:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
education department and the person that
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
was the commissioner of the edu of
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
education at the time had totally
 
00:32:35.570 --> 00:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
neglected to include the charter school
 
00:32:38.330 --> 00:32:38.340 align:start position:0%
money in the budget and I I printed out
 
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:41.460 align:start position:0%
oh oh it's an oversight so I don't see a
 
00:32:43.909 --> 00:32:43.919 align:start position:0%
lot of support for any variation within
 
00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
the people in the department of
 
00:32:47.450 --> 00:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
education but they're welcome to come to
 
00:32:49.190 --> 00:32:49.200 align:start position:0%
us and if they if they think that
 
00:32:51.710 --> 00:32:51.720 align:start position:0%
there's a way to do this better we're
 
00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:52.490 align:start position:0%
there's a way to do this better we're
open

00:32:52.490 --> 00:32:52.500 align:start position:0%
open
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:32:57.710 --> 00:32:57.720 align:start position:0%
with all due respect representative
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
I happen to be at the department when
 
00:33:01.549 --> 00:33:01.559 align:start position:0%
the charter schools were being
 
00:33:05.029 --> 00:33:05.039 align:start position:0%
established and indeed
 
00:33:06.830 --> 00:33:06.840 align:start position:0%
if there was an oversight I don't
 
00:33:10.490 --> 00:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
remember it I seem to remember
 
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:12.840 align:start position:0%
the reason why it was not in the state
 
00:33:15.529 --> 00:33:15.539 align:start position:0%
budget was because it was on federal
 
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:17.940 align:start position:0%
dollars because they had a grant a very
 
00:33:20.389 --> 00:33:20.399 align:start position:0%
large Grant and I believe Caitlyn you
 
00:33:22.130 --> 00:33:22.140 align:start position:0%
could correct me if I'm incorrect on
 
00:33:22.140 --> 00:33:23.750 align:start position:0%
could correct me if I'm incorrect on
that

00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
you don't recall
 
00:33:28.730 --> 00:33:28.740 align:start position:0%
that was before your time so just just
 
00:33:31.970 --> 00:33:31.980 align:start position:0%
to set the record spray that um
 
00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
we established many charter schools and
 
00:33:36.110 --> 00:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
we had a nice conversation yesterday
 
00:33:39.350 --> 00:33:39.360 align:start position:0%
about the velax and the great work that
 
00:33:41.930 --> 00:33:41.940 align:start position:0%
they're doing and also we have Mills
 
00:33:44.029 --> 00:33:44.039 align:start position:0%
Falls what a wonderful Charter that is
 
00:33:45.529 --> 00:33:45.539 align:start position:0%
we have some wonderful things going on
 
00:33:47.269 --> 00:33:47.279 align:start position:0%
in our charter schools and it's a
 
00:33:50.269 --> 00:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
wonderful Public School option for many
 
00:33:52.669 --> 00:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
children thank you Mr chair
 
00:33:55.130 --> 00:33:55.140 align:start position:0%
the federal money was always for
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
startups because it would take as long
 
00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
as three years to get a charter school
 
00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.490 align:start position:0%
as three years to get a charter school
organized

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
organized
 
00:34:04.789 --> 00:34:04.799 align:start position:0%
hire the staff and get it going so the
 
00:34:06.889 --> 00:34:06.899 align:start position:0%
startup money always seemed to come from
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
the feds however this oversight at the
 
00:34:12.050 --> 00:34:12.060 align:start position:0%
time was not the federal money it was
 
00:34:13.970 --> 00:34:13.980 align:start position:0%
the actual money for the students that
 
00:34:16.909 --> 00:34:16.919 align:start position:0%
were in charter schools and
 
00:34:19.010 --> 00:34:19.020 align:start position:0%
until they get a charter school started
 
00:34:20.930 --> 00:34:20.940 align:start position:0%
we don't have any way to pay the money
 
00:34:22.790 --> 00:34:22.800 align:start position:0%
because we don't have a thing and we
 
00:34:24.950 --> 00:34:24.960 align:start position:0%
don't put money aside since there was
 
00:34:27.109 --> 00:34:27.119 align:start position:0%
Federal money for startups but I also
 
00:34:27.119 --> 00:34:28.430 align:start position:0%
Federal money for startups but I also
remember

00:34:28.430 --> 00:34:28.440 align:start position:0%
remember
 
00:34:31.010 --> 00:34:31.020 align:start position:0%
some iterations where
 
00:34:33.409 --> 00:34:33.419 align:start position:0%
another oversight by the Department of
 
00:34:37.070 --> 00:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
Education the money for checks for the
 
00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:39.419 align:start position:0%
Federal grant did not get approved
 
00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
because they didn't apply for it
 
00:34:44.470 --> 00:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
so that's why I'm a little distrustful
 
00:34:47.149 --> 00:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
of the of the people in the Department
 
00:34:49.010 --> 00:34:49.020 align:start position:0%
of Education when it comes to any
 
00:34:51.290 --> 00:34:51.300 align:start position:0%
alternative to public education thank
 
00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:53.089 align:start position:0%

okay we've knocked some of these down
here

00:37:56.930 --> 00:37:56.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.970 align:start position:0%
 
oh

00:37:58.970 --> 00:37:58.980 align:start position:0%

you get to lead
 
00:38:02.870 --> 00:38:02.880 align:start position:0%
I have a copy of what you gave the
 
00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:08.290 align:start position:0%
I have a copy of what you gave the
committee

00:38:08.290 --> 00:38:08.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:10.430 --> 00:38:10.440 align:start position:0%
you're going to update it again so if
 
00:38:14.170 --> 00:38:14.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.370 --> 00:38:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:34.380 --> 00:38:43.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:43.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:48.109 --> 00:38:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:38:51.890 --> 00:38:51.900 align:start position:0%
um so the first handout that I gave you
 
00:38:52.849 --> 00:38:52.859 align:start position:0%
that was from the Department of
 
00:38:55.130 --> 00:38:55.140 align:start position:0%
Education was specific to the public
 
00:38:57.589 --> 00:38:57.599 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund so I have had
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
a few questions that have come to the
 
00:39:01.609 --> 00:39:01.619 align:start position:0%
department about the outstanding
 
00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:04.140 align:start position:0%
projects left over in the public school
 
00:39:07.550 --> 00:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund so we had prepared
 
00:39:09.410 --> 00:39:09.420 align:start position:0%
this document last time and didn't get a
 
00:39:11.750 --> 00:39:11.760 align:start position:0%
chance to discuss it it does say the
 
00:39:15.470 --> 00:39:15.480 align:start position:0%
security action for safe for security
 
00:39:17.810 --> 00:39:17.820 align:start position:0%
action for Education safe grants on that
 
00:39:20.510 --> 00:39:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I do want to just delineate between
 
00:39:22.609 --> 00:39:22.619 align:start position:0%
kind of some ongoing work the department
 
00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:24.240 align:start position:0%
has been doing and kind of the history
 
00:39:25.790 --> 00:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
of this program I think we have a little
 
00:39:29.030 --> 00:39:29.040 align:start position:0%
bit of time that we can talk about that
 
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
um so the public school infrastructure
 
00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:33.320 align:start position:0%
fund was first established in
 
00:39:37.190 --> 00:39:37.200 align:start position:0%
2018. there were three main goals of the
 
00:39:39.230 --> 00:39:39.240 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure fund it was
 
00:39:41.329 --> 00:39:41.339 align:start position:0%
to support Public School infrastructure
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
it would support safety grants for
 
00:39:45.490 --> 00:39:45.500 align:start position:0%
schools and
 
00:39:48.470 --> 00:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
e-rate projects broadband and one not
 
00:39:50.349 --> 00:39:50.359 align:start position:0%
project at schools
 
00:39:53.690 --> 00:39:53.700 align:start position:0%
the fund was funded from leftover
 
00:39:56.930 --> 00:39:56.940 align:start position:0%
funding after the rainy day fund was
 
00:39:59.210 --> 00:39:59.220 align:start position:0%
topped off after at a hundred million
 
00:40:00.770 --> 00:40:00.780 align:start position:0%
dollars so what was ever the remaining
 
00:40:02.690 --> 00:40:02.700 align:start position:0%
amount was to give be given to the
 
00:40:04.430 --> 00:40:04.440 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to distribute to
 
00:40:07.190 --> 00:40:07.200 align:start position:0%
schools in a competitive manner so this
 
00:40:09.650 --> 00:40:09.660 align:start position:0%
was in 2018
 
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:13.260 align:start position:0%
um the budget in 2000 and uh for 18.
 
00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:14.210 align:start position:0%
um the budget in 2000 and uh for 18.
um

00:40:14.210 --> 00:40:14.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
almost immediately after the public
 
00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:18.720 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund was funded
 
00:40:20.810 --> 00:40:20.820 align:start position:0%
because so just timing wise just to
 
00:40:23.810 --> 00:40:23.820 align:start position:0%
remind everybody so fiscal year 18
 
00:40:27.349 --> 00:40:27.359 align:start position:0%
started in July of 2017 the state budget
 
00:40:30.170 --> 00:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
the state audit has to go through all of
 
00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:31.500 align:start position:0%
the financial statements need to be
 
00:40:33.589 --> 00:40:33.599 align:start position:0%
finalized and that was the point that we
 
00:40:34.849 --> 00:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
knew how much money was going to be
 
00:40:36.290 --> 00:40:36.300 align:start position:0%
given to the department for the public
 
00:40:39.050 --> 00:40:39.060 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund it was about
 
00:40:40.970 --> 00:40:40.980 align:start position:0%
December January
 
00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
um there was
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
um at about that exact same time that
 
00:40:46.310 --> 00:40:46.320 align:start position:0%
the department started having
 
00:40:48.589 --> 00:40:48.599 align:start position:0%
conversations with schools and and
 
00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:50.339 align:start position:0%
um establishing this process for the
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure fund the
 
00:40:53.930 --> 00:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
Parkland school shooting had happened
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
and the majority of the funding that was
 
00:40:58.069 --> 00:40:58.079 align:start position:0%
established under the public school
 
00:41:00.349 --> 00:41:00.359 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund went specifically to
 
00:41:04.430 --> 00:41:04.440 align:start position:0%
fund projects for school safety so this
 
00:41:06.890 --> 00:41:06.900 align:start position:0%
was 2018 this was the first time that
 
00:41:08.510 --> 00:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
had happened
 
00:41:10.430 --> 00:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
um the first large distribution of
 
00:41:12.829 --> 00:41:12.839 align:start position:0%
funding there were some infrastructure
 
00:41:15.050 --> 00:41:15.060 align:start position:0%
type projects and some e-rite projects
 
00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:17.220 align:start position:0%
that were funded at that time but a
 
00:41:19.250 --> 00:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
large majority of them were a safety
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
type projects the department ran a
 
00:41:23.510 --> 00:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
competitive Grant process and school
 
00:41:25.630 --> 00:41:25.640 align:start position:0%
districts applied to the department
 
00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:30.420 align:start position:0%
there weren't caps on projects we did I
 
00:41:32.510 --> 00:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
think it was an 80 20 split at some
 
00:41:34.010 --> 00:41:34.020 align:start position:0%
point there was some local matching it
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
was involved almost every school in the
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
state received funding at that time for
 
00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:41.280 align:start position:0%
these safety type projects an additional
 
00:41:43.490 --> 00:41:43.500 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars was also added
 
00:41:45.470 --> 00:41:45.480 align:start position:0%
um and I don't remember how that 10
 
00:41:46.609 --> 00:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
million dollars was added I don't know
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
if it was through a budget or through a
 
00:41:49.910 --> 00:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
build I don't know if Mickey you even
 
00:41:51.950 --> 00:41:51.960 align:start position:0%
remember that in any way it ended up
 
00:41:56.089 --> 00:41:56.099 align:start position:0%
being about 30 million dollars in 2018.
 
00:41:58.450 --> 00:41:58.460 align:start position:0%
um as part of the state biennium budget
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
this past time go around an additional
 
00:42:04.250 --> 00:42:04.260 align:start position:0%
million dollars was added per year to
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education budget plus
 
00:42:07.130 --> 00:42:07.140 align:start position:0%
we had
 
00:42:08.930 --> 00:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
um some money that was left over from
 
00:42:11.089 --> 00:42:11.099 align:start position:0%
the previous round of funding school
 
00:42:13.550 --> 00:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
districts had either come under budget
 
00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:15.900 align:start position:0%
for some of their projects and gave the
 
00:42:16.970 --> 00:42:16.980 align:start position:0%
additional funding back to the
 
00:42:18.349 --> 00:42:18.359 align:start position:0%
department some of the projects didn't
 
00:42:20.569 --> 00:42:20.579 align:start position:0%
go to for fruition because towns weren't
 
00:42:23.510 --> 00:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
able to do their votes and whatnot so we
 
00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:24.550 align:start position:0%
able to do their votes and whatnot so we
had

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:24.560 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:42:26.930 --> 00:42:26.940 align:start position:0%
approximately three million dollars left
 
00:42:29.270 --> 00:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
over and then we had the million dollars
 
00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:30.720 align:start position:0%
each year that was added to the state
 
00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:31.670 align:start position:0%
each year that was added to the state
budget

00:42:31.670 --> 00:42:31.680 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:42:34.550 --> 00:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
um for this for for fiscal year 20
 
00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:36.800 align:start position:0%
um 2 and 23.
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
unfortunately in June or May of um 22
 
00:42:43.069 --> 00:42:43.079 align:start position:0%
the Uvalde school shooting happened in
 
00:42:44.390 --> 00:42:44.400 align:start position:0%
Texas and this public school
 
00:42:46.609 --> 00:42:46.619 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund became a priority
 
00:42:50.089 --> 00:42:50.099 align:start position:0%
again at that time and we had an
 
00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:51.960 align:start position:0%
additional 10 million dollars allocated
 
00:42:54.530 --> 00:42:54.540 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education
 
00:42:57.410 --> 00:42:57.420 align:start position:0%
um by gopher so Federal stimulus funding
 
00:42:59.630 --> 00:42:59.640 align:start position:0%
to the Department of Education to then
 
00:43:02.089 --> 00:43:02.099 align:start position:0%
give additional safety grants to school
 
00:43:05.510 --> 00:43:05.520 align:start position:0%
districts we opened up a very very short
 
00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:06.370 align:start position:0%
districts we opened up a very very short
window

00:43:06.370 --> 00:43:06.380 align:start position:0%
window
 
00:43:08.870 --> 00:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
for school districts to apply it was a
 
00:43:11.690 --> 00:43:11.700 align:start position:0%
competitive nature over the summer so we
 
00:43:13.849 --> 00:43:13.859 align:start position:0%
were allocated that funding in for the
 
00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:15.660 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee meeting in July we
 
00:43:17.510 --> 00:43:17.520 align:start position:0%
immediately opened up a window to start
 
00:43:20.150 --> 00:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
accepting applications and received a
 
00:43:22.490 --> 00:43:22.500 align:start position:0%
large number of applications in July and
 
00:43:24.410 --> 00:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
then opened up another window in August
 
00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
and received another large number of
 
00:43:26.760 --> 00:43:28.089 align:start position:0%
and received another large number of
applications

00:43:28.089 --> 00:43:28.099 align:start position:0%
applications
 
00:43:30.589 --> 00:43:30.599 align:start position:0%
so the Department of Education then
 
00:43:32.270 --> 00:43:32.280 align:start position:0%
began its process of awarding those
 
00:43:35.390 --> 00:43:35.400 align:start position:0%
funds which is Homeland Security reviews
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
all of the application and determines
 
00:43:40.010 --> 00:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
the priority they have a ranking process
 
00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:44.400 align:start position:0%
for those applications they provide that
 
00:43:45.770 --> 00:43:45.780 align:start position:0%
information to the department the
 
00:43:47.690 --> 00:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
department meets with the public school
 
00:43:49.430 --> 00:43:49.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure commission which is a
 
00:43:52.849 --> 00:43:52.859 align:start position:0%
legislative committee and to look at
 
00:43:55.309 --> 00:43:55.319 align:start position:0%
those rankings that were done mostly on
 
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
the basis of need by Homeland Security
 
00:44:01.190 --> 00:44:01.200 align:start position:0%
and award funding so they did
 
00:44:03.530 --> 00:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
three tranches of funding
 
00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
um or sorry two tranches of funding um
 
00:44:07.250 --> 00:44:07.260 align:start position:0%
the first they awarded all of the state
 
00:44:08.809 --> 00:44:08.819 align:start position:0%
funding that they had left over because
 
00:44:10.910 --> 00:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
we knew that was um we that was there
 
00:44:12.950 --> 00:44:12.960 align:start position:0%
and then we worked through the process
 
00:44:14.809 --> 00:44:14.819 align:start position:0%
of um all of the reporting and whatnot
 
00:44:16.069 --> 00:44:16.079 align:start position:0%
that needed to be done for the federal
 
00:44:18.950 --> 00:44:18.960 align:start position:0%
funding and at the same time was working
 
00:44:20.510 --> 00:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
with fiscal to get that money allocated
 
00:44:22.790 --> 00:44:22.800 align:start position:0%
to the department and then met again in
 
00:44:24.530 --> 00:44:24.540 align:start position:0%
maybe September
 
00:44:26.750 --> 00:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
um yes it was governor and Council in
 
00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:28.250 align:start position:0%
um yes it was governor and Council in
September

00:44:28.250 --> 00:44:28.260 align:start position:0%
September
 
00:44:30.170 --> 00:44:30.180 align:start position:0%
um to award the second 10 million
 
00:44:32.930 --> 00:44:32.940 align:start position:0%
dollars so out of those two short
 
00:44:34.550 --> 00:44:34.560 align:start position:0%
windows at school districts applied we
 
00:44:36.470 --> 00:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
had a large number of schools apply I
 
00:44:38.270 --> 00:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
forget the total number of schools that
 
00:44:41.930 --> 00:44:41.940 align:start position:0%
applied but we still have outstanding
 
00:44:44.690 --> 00:44:44.700 align:start position:0%
um 20 oh so we actually it does have the
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
handout has it right here so it has 10
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:56.690 --> 00:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
um and we still have 557 applications
 
00:44:59.690 --> 00:44:59.700 align:start position:0%
not funded and 21 million dollars worth
 
00:45:01.730 --> 00:45:01.740 align:start position:0%
of requests still outstanding to the
 
00:45:01.740 --> 00:45:02.870 align:start position:0%
of requests still outstanding to the
department

00:45:02.870 --> 00:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:45:04.550 --> 00:45:04.560 align:start position:0%
um that we have not funded at this time
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
now we do have a little bit of money but
 
00:45:08.569 --> 00:45:08.579 align:start position:0%
it's a few hundred thousand dollars that
 
00:45:10.010 --> 00:45:10.020 align:start position:0%
we're going to meet and obligate it's
 
00:45:11.569 --> 00:45:11.579 align:start position:0%
certainly not millions of dollars for
 
00:45:11.579 --> 00:45:12.890 align:start position:0%
certainly not millions of dollars for
this

00:45:12.890 --> 00:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:45:14.569 --> 00:45:14.579 align:start position:0%
um so these are the applications that we
 
00:45:15.890 --> 00:45:15.900 align:start position:0%
had received
 
00:45:18.770 --> 00:45:18.780 align:start position:0%
um the department did cap these projects
 
00:45:20.809 --> 00:45:20.819 align:start position:0%
at a hundred thousand dollars a piece
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
and was very specific to the types of
 
00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
projects that were um allowed
 
00:45:28.130 --> 00:45:28.140 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:45:29.630 --> 00:45:29.640 align:start position:0%
um they were mostly
 
00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
um the 10 million dollars for example
 
00:45:33.650 --> 00:45:33.660 align:start position:0%
when to fund security and access
 
00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.670 align:start position:0%
when to fund security and access
um Alone

00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
um Alone
 
00:45:36.349 --> 00:45:36.359 align:start position:0%
um so the the second window was much
 
00:45:39.109 --> 00:45:39.119 align:start position:0%
more tailored to specifically school
 
00:45:41.030 --> 00:45:41.040 align:start position:0%
um school safety type projects and and
 
00:45:43.550 --> 00:45:43.560 align:start position:0%
that's where we are so the Department of
 
00:45:45.890 --> 00:45:45.900 align:start position:0%
Education had put in its budget
 
00:45:48.050 --> 00:45:48.060 align:start position:0%
um a request of five million dollars a
 
00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
year each year as a prioritized need and
 
00:45:52.430 --> 00:45:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's where we are we're continuing to
 
00:45:54.670 --> 00:45:54.680 align:start position:0%
ask for that five million dollars a year
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
to be added back to the Department's
 
00:45:59.349 --> 00:45:59.359 align:start position:0%
budget to fund these types of projects
 
00:46:02.809 --> 00:46:02.819 align:start position:0%
now there we do have potentially some
 
00:46:04.370 --> 00:46:04.380 align:start position:0%
federal funding that could be coming to
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
us to fund a
 
00:46:08.569 --> 00:46:08.579 align:start position:0%
number of these projects but we don't
 
00:46:10.609 --> 00:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
anticipate it would fund 21 million
 
00:46:13.069 --> 00:46:13.079 align:start position:0%
dollars worth of projects and then the
 
00:46:14.809 --> 00:46:14.819 align:start position:0%
other thing is is you know are we going
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
to go up and open this up in the future
 
00:46:18.109 --> 00:46:18.119 align:start position:0%
and let additional people apply and
 
00:46:19.970 --> 00:46:19.980 align:start position:0%
whatnot so that's where we are that's
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
the whole history of the program that's
 
00:46:24.589 --> 00:46:24.599 align:start position:0%
the request on behalf of the department
 
00:46:27.230 --> 00:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to add that um there are
 
00:46:29.270 --> 00:46:29.280 align:start position:0%
other schools besides public schools
 
00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:31.920 align:start position:0%
that have access to these funds correct
 
00:46:33.290 --> 00:46:33.300 align:start position:0%
for the second tranche of money the
 
00:46:35.030 --> 00:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
federal money um that was all schools
 
00:46:38.210 --> 00:46:38.220 align:start position:0%
that had access to them committee yes um
 
00:46:40.250 --> 00:46:40.260 align:start position:0%
so for the first part um that's a that
 
00:46:41.930 --> 00:46:41.940 align:start position:0%
is a good good thing to point out so the
 
00:46:43.069 --> 00:46:43.079 align:start position:0%
first money the public school
 
00:46:45.710 --> 00:46:45.720 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund money which was the
 
00:46:48.589 --> 00:46:48.599 align:start position:0%
state funding that money only went to
 
00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:50.700 align:start position:0%
Public District and chartered Public
 
00:46:53.329 --> 00:46:53.339 align:start position:0%
Schools the 10 million dollars
 
00:46:55.370 --> 00:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
um some of that did go to non-public
 
00:46:56.990 --> 00:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
schools they were eligible to apply for
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
those funding too although we use the
 
00:47:00.829 --> 00:47:00.839 align:start position:0%
same structure application process
 
00:47:03.530 --> 00:47:03.540 align:start position:0%
across the board for the second launch
 
00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:06.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:11.150 --> 00:47:11.160 align:start position:0%
thank you but working the question right
 
00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:12.839 align:start position:0%
now you have about 21 million in
 
00:47:14.809 --> 00:47:14.819 align:start position:0%
outstanding requests and we are not for
 
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
now going to worry about what inflation
 
00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.020 align:start position:0%
will do to those requests
 
00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
um you said that you obviously at some
 
00:47:22.790 --> 00:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
point may want to reopen I'm just trying
 
00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
to understand the department has an idea
 
00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:26.540 align:start position:0%
of what's the uh
 
00:47:30.410 --> 00:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
ballpark of the potential total need in
 
00:47:32.690 --> 00:47:32.700 align:start position:0%
the state based on the types of projects
 
00:47:34.069 --> 00:47:34.079 align:start position:0%
that you are doing and the you know
 
00:47:36.050 --> 00:47:36.060 align:start position:0%
number of schools I know I'm asking for
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
a you know shot in the dark but I'm just
 
00:47:41.270 --> 00:47:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:43.609 --> 00:47:43.619 align:start position:0%
in order to you know
 
00:47:45.829 --> 00:47:45.839 align:start position:0%
properly plan and forecast for those
 
00:47:45.839 --> 00:47:46.849 align:start position:0%
properly plan and forecast for those
things

00:47:46.849 --> 00:47:46.859 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:47:49.370 --> 00:47:49.380 align:start position:0%
it's it would be useful to get an idea
 
00:47:51.650 --> 00:47:51.660 align:start position:0%
of you know how much more is waiting yet
 
00:47:54.589 --> 00:47:54.599 align:start position:0%
unapplied if and obviously since they
 
00:47:55.970 --> 00:47:55.980 align:start position:0%
didn't apply you wouldn't know for sure
 
00:47:58.790 --> 00:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
but do you have any idea I I don't that
 
00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
might be a question for Homeland
 
00:48:02.270 --> 00:48:02.280 align:start position:0%
Security Homeland Security has a very
 
00:48:03.710 --> 00:48:03.720 align:start position:0%
rigorous process that they're working
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
with schools on a regular basis they'll
 
00:48:07.490 --> 00:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
go out and they do safety assessments
 
00:48:09.530 --> 00:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
and they identify Safety and Security
 
00:48:13.370 --> 00:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
risks at schools and then we so we
 
00:48:14.630 --> 00:48:14.640 align:start position:0%
handle a lot of the fiscal management
 
00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:16.500 align:start position:0%
the grant piece side of things and then
 
00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:18.420 align:start position:0%
as far as the actual needs of the
 
00:48:20.329 --> 00:48:20.339 align:start position:0%
schools Homeland Security is doing that
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
and we feel like that's a very good
 
00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:24.370 align:start position:0%
and we feel like that's a very good
um

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:24.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
delineation of responsibility right now
 
00:48:28.970 --> 00:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
because we we're great at the financial
 
00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
piece and the grant manage piece but
 
00:48:32.150 --> 00:48:32.160 align:start position:0%
they have a whole and you have staff
 
00:48:33.950 --> 00:48:33.960 align:start position:0%
over there that that focus on that work
 
00:48:37.550 --> 00:48:37.560 align:start position:0%
so if I could ask since you already have
 
00:48:39.470 --> 00:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
a really good connection to the DHS and
 
00:48:41.630 --> 00:48:41.640 align:start position:0%
have cooperated tightly on this matters
 
00:48:42.950 --> 00:48:42.960 align:start position:0%
is it something where you could maybe
 
00:48:44.990 --> 00:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
reach out to them and just
 
00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:47.460 align:start position:0%
get us an understanding obviously what
 
00:48:49.910 --> 00:48:49.920 align:start position:0%
the DHS identifies as a need may not
 
00:48:51.349 --> 00:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily be a need that the local
 
00:48:53.329 --> 00:48:53.339 align:start position:0%
school district feels that it needs to
 
00:48:54.950 --> 00:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
be addressed or the local voters would
 
00:48:57.530 --> 00:48:57.540 align:start position:0%
approve so I understand all those
 
00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
limitations but
 
00:49:01.670 --> 00:49:01.680 align:start position:0%
it would be good to have a feel of what
 
00:49:04.490 --> 00:49:04.500 align:start position:0%
may be the pent-up demand for the lack
 
00:49:06.650 --> 00:49:06.660 align:start position:0%
of a better word uh you know for those
 
00:49:08.089 --> 00:49:08.099 align:start position:0%
programs because
 
00:49:10.069 --> 00:49:10.079 align:start position:0%
you know when you open the
 
00:49:12.230 --> 00:49:12.240 align:start position:0%
bonding Gates you want to kind of see
 
00:49:14.450 --> 00:49:14.460 align:start position:0%
what may be coming uh from the other
 
00:49:16.670 --> 00:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
side you know so I mean I think it's
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
fair to say it's at least 21 million
 
00:49:21.050 --> 00:49:21.060 align:start position:0%
dollars wow I I think we all agree to
 
00:49:24.770 --> 00:49:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
being here Caitlyn
 
00:49:28.680 --> 00:49:29.870 align:start position:0%
being here Caitlyn
um

00:49:29.870 --> 00:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton you mentioned giving money to
 
00:49:32.760 --> 00:49:34.069 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton you mentioned giving money to
non

00:49:34.069 --> 00:49:34.079 align:start position:0%
non
 
00:49:37.550 --> 00:49:37.560 align:start position:0%
Public Schools is no what what status is
 
00:49:39.530 --> 00:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
Cole Brown and Pinkerton and is there
 
00:49:41.990 --> 00:49:42.000 align:start position:0%
others I mean that and and those are
 
00:49:44.089 --> 00:49:44.099 align:start position:0%
those are Pub they get supported by
 
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
taxation is that correct you know
 
00:49:49.309 --> 00:49:49.319 align:start position:0%
property tax so Pinkerton I don't know
 
00:49:50.870 --> 00:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
if I should be like saying this on the
 
00:49:52.790 --> 00:49:52.800 align:start position:0%
record because I'm not 100 sure as far
 
00:49:55.550 --> 00:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
as the details and really what it it
 
00:49:57.650 --> 00:49:57.660 align:start position:0%
Pinkerton and Cole Brown
 
00:49:59.990 --> 00:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
have tuition agreements with towns and
 
00:50:02.089 --> 00:50:02.099 align:start position:0%
they accept students via tuition
 
00:50:02.099 --> 00:50:04.210 align:start position:0%
they accept students via tuition
agreements

00:50:04.210 --> 00:50:04.220 align:start position:0%
agreements
 
00:50:06.950 --> 00:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
they follow a lot of the same standards
 
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
as public schools and as far as
 
00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:11.520 align:start position:0%
accepting federal federal or federal
 
00:50:13.849 --> 00:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
funding I believe they do not receive
 
00:50:15.410 --> 00:50:15.420 align:start position:0%
federal funding directly I know Cole
 
00:50:17.030 --> 00:50:17.040 align:start position:0%
Brown doesn't and I believe Pinkerton
 
00:50:18.589 --> 00:50:18.599 align:start position:0%
does not maybe with the exception of
 
00:50:20.569 --> 00:50:20.579 align:start position:0%
certain grants they don't receive
 
00:50:22.430 --> 00:50:22.440 align:start position:0%
adequacy directly from us we give the
 
00:50:24.770 --> 00:50:24.780 align:start position:0%
adequacy to the town of residency for
 
00:50:26.690 --> 00:50:26.700 align:start position:0%
those students and they pass among those
 
00:50:28.910 --> 00:50:28.920 align:start position:0%
funds but I do believe they would be
 
00:50:30.829 --> 00:50:30.839 align:start position:0%
eligible to apply under at least the
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
safe grants if not also the public
 
00:50:36.050 --> 00:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
school infrastructure fund so it's just
 
00:50:38.329 --> 00:50:38.339 align:start position:0%
a tuition agreement basically to the
 
00:50:39.890 --> 00:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
from the town they have tuition
 
00:50:41.630 --> 00:50:41.640 align:start position:0%
agreements with towns yes thank you very
 
00:50:41.640 --> 00:50:45.050 align:start position:0%
agreements with towns yes thank you very
much

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:47.220 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:50:50.630 --> 00:50:50.640 align:start position:0%
uh did the governor review this
 
00:50:53.930 --> 00:50:53.940 align:start position:0%
prior to their preparations the
 
00:50:55.910 --> 00:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
governor's office did not fund this line
 
00:50:58.370 --> 00:50:58.380 align:start position:0%
and we mentioned that the other day in
 
00:50:58.380 --> 00:50:59.270 align:start position:0%
and we mentioned that the other day in
our

00:50:59.270 --> 00:50:59.280 align:start position:0%
our
 
00:51:01.670 --> 00:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
um in our hearing okay
 
00:51:03.890 --> 00:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
so this was a prioritized need requested
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
by the Department of Education
 
00:51:07.130 --> 00:51:07.140 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
he didn't put anything in hb2 for this
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
there was no request there's no funding
 
00:51:13.549 --> 00:51:13.559 align:start position:0%
for the public school infrastructure
 
00:51:15.890 --> 00:51:15.900 align:start position:0%
fund um tell me about the possibility of
 
00:51:18.349 --> 00:51:18.359 align:start position:0%
federal funds um I know there's just
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
over the years we've had a lot of
 
00:51:23.690 --> 00:51:23.700 align:start position:0%
discussion at the federal level about
 
00:51:25.390 --> 00:51:25.400 align:start position:0%
these fun
 
00:51:28.490 --> 00:51:28.500 align:start position:0%
securing the vestibules um getting alert
 
00:51:30.710 --> 00:51:30.720 align:start position:0%
systems uh it's wonderful work what's
 
00:51:32.390 --> 00:51:32.400 align:start position:0%
happened in this commission
 
00:51:33.829 --> 00:51:33.839 align:start position:0%
um we've been meeting now I don't even
 
00:51:37.250 --> 00:51:37.260 align:start position:0%
know how many years and the schools are
 
00:51:40.490 --> 00:51:40.500 align:start position:0%
based on their emergency plans are much
 
00:51:44.150 --> 00:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
more safe than previously and you'll see
 
00:51:45.650 --> 00:51:45.660 align:start position:0%
when you go to a building everything's
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
locked and there are buzzers and it's
 
00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:49.740 align:start position:0%
it's it's
 
00:51:51.410 --> 00:51:51.420 align:start position:0%
not the friendly little schools that
 
00:51:53.930 --> 00:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
used to be opened all the time there's a
 
00:51:57.109 --> 00:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
lot of security but um there's more talk
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
about this I think in some of the
 
00:52:01.130 --> 00:52:01.140 align:start position:0%
federal dollars coming you think there's
 
00:52:03.230 --> 00:52:03.240 align:start position:0%
going to be more coming from there so we
 
00:52:04.609 --> 00:52:04.619 align:start position:0%
have had some federal grants that we
 
00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
have written for
 
00:52:09.290 --> 00:52:09.300 align:start position:0%
um that would allow us to fund similar
 
00:52:11.630 --> 00:52:11.640 align:start position:0%
type projects it doesn't necessarily
 
00:52:13.430 --> 00:52:13.440 align:start position:0%
mean these projects themselves would be
 
00:52:15.230 --> 00:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
able to be funded especially
 
00:52:17.510 --> 00:52:17.520 align:start position:0%
you know since we accepted these grants
 
00:52:19.190 --> 00:52:19.200 align:start position:0%
in the past they might have additional
 
00:52:20.930 --> 00:52:20.940 align:start position:0%
requirements they might have a threshold
 
00:52:23.390 --> 00:52:23.400 align:start position:0%
say of a certain level of free introduce
 
00:52:25.790 --> 00:52:25.800 align:start position:0%
lunch be met or they might have to be a
 
00:52:28.309 --> 00:52:28.319 align:start position:0%
project done after such and such date
 
00:52:30.170 --> 00:52:30.180 align:start position:0%
um so anytime there's Federal funding
 
00:52:32.510 --> 00:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
there's restrictions and so it's not
 
00:52:34.670 --> 00:52:34.680 align:start position:0%
necessarily we can guarantee funding for
 
00:52:37.490 --> 00:52:37.500 align:start position:0%
these projects but we will continue and
 
00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:39.300 align:start position:0%
I have said this now um you know at
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and whatnot that we
 
00:52:42.650 --> 00:52:42.660 align:start position:0%
will continue to seek additional
 
00:52:44.329 --> 00:52:44.339 align:start position:0%
resources for any of these types of
 
00:52:46.370 --> 00:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
projects and we are very committed to
 
00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.450 align:start position:0%
projects and we are very committed to
that

00:52:47.450 --> 00:52:47.460 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:52:50.030 --> 00:52:50.040 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't necessarily mean that
 
00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:52.740 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll be successful thank you
 
00:52:54.589 --> 00:52:54.599 align:start position:0%
because usually the federal funds go
 
00:52:57.109 --> 00:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
specifically to Public Schools correct
 
00:52:59.569 --> 00:52:59.579 align:start position:0%
right so that might be a category it can
 
00:53:01.849 --> 00:53:01.859 align:start position:0%
only go to federals the the nice thing
 
00:53:03.710 --> 00:53:03.720 align:start position:0%
about the stimulus funding I think we've
 
00:53:05.270 --> 00:53:05.280 align:start position:0%
all learned is there's a lot of
 
00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:07.069 align:start position:0%
all learned is there's a lot of
flexibility

00:53:07.069 --> 00:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
flexibility
 
00:53:09.829 --> 00:53:09.839 align:start position:0%
um as far as our ability to manage the
 
00:53:11.210 --> 00:53:11.220 align:start position:0%
programs and who we could give funding
 
00:53:12.650 --> 00:53:12.660 align:start position:0%
to and whatnot
 
00:53:14.930 --> 00:53:14.940 align:start position:0%
um that same nice level of flexibility
 
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
is very rare especially in education
 
00:53:18.890 --> 00:53:18.900 align:start position:0%
funding education Federal funding is
 
00:53:20.930 --> 00:53:20.940 align:start position:0%
usually very prescriptive as far as the
 
00:53:23.450 --> 00:53:23.460 align:start position:0%
uses and the time periods and the
 
00:53:25.549 --> 00:53:25.559 align:start position:0%
reporting and whatnot so so you're
 
00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:28.140 align:start position:0%
looking for this funding to really be
 
00:53:32.329 --> 00:53:32.339 align:start position:0%
able to provide support to sectarian
 
00:53:34.250 --> 00:53:34.260 align:start position:0%
um non-public
 
00:53:36.650 --> 00:53:36.660 align:start position:0%
schools that are out there I don't think
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
that's a fair statement No Okay um so we
 
00:53:41.150 --> 00:53:41.160 align:start position:0%
asked for this funding um under the
 
00:53:43.370 --> 00:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure line to
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
cover all the areas that are currently
 
00:53:50.750 --> 00:53:50.760 align:start position:0%
funded um and we first so just timing
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
wise I think I think that
 
00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:53.329 align:start position:0%
wise I think I think that
um

00:53:53.329 --> 00:53:53.339 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
the legislature and you all don't
 
00:53:56.270 --> 00:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily know how early the
 
00:53:58.190 --> 00:53:58.200 align:start position:0%
Departments begin working on our budgets
 
00:53:59.569 --> 00:53:59.579 align:start position:0%
I know you do because you worked at the
 
00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:01.140 align:start position:0%
department but so when we're talking
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
about positions for example we I was
 
00:54:06.109 --> 00:54:06.119 align:start position:0%
looking back at the position paperwork
 
00:54:08.210 --> 00:54:08.220 align:start position:0%
that I submitted to my business office I
 
00:54:10.490 --> 00:54:10.500 align:start position:0%
did that in March of last year
 
00:54:11.690 --> 00:54:11.700 align:start position:0%
um and I know you're looking at it now
 
00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:13.140 align:start position:0%
here in March of this year but it's
 
00:54:14.630 --> 00:54:14.640 align:start position:0%
because I was like what I was trying to
 
00:54:16.010 --> 00:54:16.020 align:start position:0%
remember what some of the positions were
 
00:54:18.170 --> 00:54:18.180 align:start position:0%
but it's that long ago and so when we
 
00:54:20.450 --> 00:54:20.460 align:start position:0%
had said let's put 5 million then the
 
00:54:21.829 --> 00:54:21.839 align:start position:0%
Department's prioritized needs that was
 
00:54:23.750 --> 00:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
last spring that was before the Uvaldi
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
shooting had happened that was before we
 
00:54:26.750 --> 00:54:26.760 align:start position:0%
received that 10 million dollars and we
 
00:54:28.190 --> 00:54:28.200 align:start position:0%
had said no we're going to put a
 
00:54:30.109 --> 00:54:30.119 align:start position:0%
prioritized need in a 5 million dollars
 
00:54:32.210 --> 00:54:32.220 align:start position:0%
a year because we think that continuing
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
to fund the public school infrastructure
 
00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
fund and security and safety projects is
 
00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:38.160 align:start position:0%
a priority priority of the department so
 
00:54:40.670 --> 00:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
as you say Public School
 
00:54:42.950 --> 00:54:42.960 align:start position:0%
um would Public Schools get priority
 
00:54:45.230 --> 00:54:45.240 align:start position:0%
then in these funds so the five million
 
00:54:47.390 --> 00:54:47.400 align:start position:0%
I believe would um
 
00:54:50.329 --> 00:54:50.339 align:start position:0%
the Department's request is in the the
 
00:54:53.569 --> 00:54:53.579 align:start position:0%
line item that we have for public school
 
00:54:56.150 --> 00:54:56.160 align:start position:0%
infrastructure funds Mickey I don't know
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
if you can confirm that if we put it in
 
00:55:01.010 --> 00:55:01.020 align:start position:0%
the two and one nine six four could you
 
00:55:02.270 --> 00:55:02.280 align:start position:0%
check if that's an accounting unit do
 
00:55:04.089 --> 00:55:04.099 align:start position:0%
you know can you do that
 
00:55:06.349 --> 00:55:06.359 align:start position:0%
five million dollars
 
00:55:09.710 --> 00:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh for yeah for this request yes yeah so
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
we would have to fear on mechanically
 
00:55:13.010 --> 00:55:13.020 align:start position:0%
how you would want to do this if you
 
00:55:14.870 --> 00:55:14.880 align:start position:0%
approved it what we've done in the past
 
00:55:16.730 --> 00:55:16.740 align:start position:0%
is just done a general fund transfer to
 
00:55:18.410 --> 00:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
the public school infrastructure fund or
 
00:55:19.849 --> 00:55:19.859 align:start position:0%
if you want to put it in house bill one
 
00:55:22.549 --> 00:55:22.559 align:start position:0%
with a different funding source but the
 
00:55:24.349 --> 00:55:24.359 align:start position:0%
department has provided me a an
 
00:55:27.109 --> 00:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
accounting structure to do this and it's
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
accounting unit uh 196. okay so that's
 
00:55:31.309 --> 00:55:31.319 align:start position:0%
the the accounting unit that we set up
 
00:55:32.390 --> 00:55:32.400 align:start position:0%
specifically for the public school
 
00:55:34.130 --> 00:55:34.140 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund and there's a law
 
00:55:38.990 --> 00:55:39.000 align:start position:0%
RSA 19815 why why maybe
 
00:55:41.329 --> 00:55:41.339 align:start position:0%
um I'm actually it's just it's reference
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
right here um in in your handout that
 
00:55:46.250 --> 00:55:46.260 align:start position:0%
defines who those funds can go to so so
 
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
I mean you could certainly change that
 
00:55:51.109 --> 00:55:51.119 align:start position:0%
through House Bill too if you guys can
 
00:55:52.730 --> 00:55:52.740 align:start position:0%
change anything you want
 
00:55:54.049 --> 00:55:54.059 align:start position:0%
um but that's really what defines the
 
00:55:55.430 --> 00:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
public school infrastructure and the
 
00:55:57.530 --> 00:55:57.540 align:start position:0%
current format and whatnot so all right
 
00:56:00.170 --> 00:56:00.180 align:start position:0%
thank you and I mean to pick on you nope
 
00:56:02.089 --> 00:56:02.099 align:start position:0%
you are always welcome Caitlin thank you
 
00:56:04.930 --> 00:56:04.940 align:start position:0%
all right thank you uh how much
 
00:56:08.089 --> 00:56:08.099 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise does these launch go to
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
non-public schools so
 
00:56:14.510 --> 00:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
let's see it was a very and is that like
 
00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:16.980 align:start position:0%
Paul school I mean uh so the schools
 
00:56:18.109 --> 00:56:18.119 align:start position:0%
that received
 
00:56:21.650 --> 00:56:21.660 align:start position:0%
um funding okay are on the list in front
 
00:56:23.930 --> 00:56:23.940 align:start position:0%
of you here
 
00:56:25.730 --> 00:56:25.740 align:start position:0%
so we have the non-public schools and
 
00:56:28.069 --> 00:56:28.079 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I don't have a subtotal
 
00:56:30.530 --> 00:56:30.540 align:start position:0%
specifically for non-public schools but
 
00:56:32.270 --> 00:56:32.280 align:start position:0%
you can see
 
00:56:34.970 --> 00:56:34.980 align:start position:0%
um looking through here starting on page
 
00:56:37.309 --> 00:56:37.319 align:start position:0%
it says five of seven
 
00:56:39.470 --> 00:56:39.480 align:start position:0%
down the bottom
 
00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.210 align:start position:0%
down the bottom
um

00:56:41.210 --> 00:56:41.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
and you can probably count up
 
00:56:47.030 --> 00:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
I'm guessing just trying to sum this up
 
00:56:49.370 --> 00:56:49.380 align:start position:0%
real quick in my brain probably a
 
00:56:52.370 --> 00:56:52.380 align:start position:0%
million dollars maybe
 
00:56:56.510 --> 00:56:56.520 align:start position:0%
looks like was requested by non-public
 
00:56:56.520 --> 00:56:57.770 align:start position:0%
looks like was requested by non-public
schools

00:56:57.770 --> 00:56:57.780 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
but it looks like a fair amount of that
 
00:57:02.870 --> 00:57:02.880 align:start position:0%
was not funded oh I see okay yeah for
 
00:57:04.849 --> 00:57:04.859 align:start position:0%
example the Diocese of Manchester which
 
00:57:06.349 --> 00:57:06.359 align:start position:0%
has a number of schools applied for
 
00:57:07.670 --> 00:57:07.680 align:start position:0%
three hundred and thirty thousand
 
00:57:09.410 --> 00:57:09.420 align:start position:0%
dollars but they still have two hundred
 
00:57:12.230 --> 00:57:12.240 align:start position:0%
and seventy thousand dollars not funded
 
00:57:13.849 --> 00:57:13.859 align:start position:0%
um so um
 
00:57:16.010 --> 00:57:16.020 align:start position:0%
so quite a bit of the non-public school
 
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
funding quite the majority of the
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
funding I think it's fair to say the
 
00:57:21.530 --> 00:57:21.540 align:start position:0%
majority of the funding went to either
 
00:57:23.990 --> 00:57:24.000 align:start position:0%
Public District or public charter
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
schools and one of the questions if you
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
applied for round one
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
does that you hold over that application
 
00:57:33.349 --> 00:57:33.359 align:start position:0%
for round two we did do that for this
 
00:57:33.359 --> 00:57:34.790 align:start position:0%
for round two we did do that for this
instance

00:57:34.790 --> 00:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
instance
 
00:57:37.190 --> 00:57:37.200 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't well and actually so round
 
00:57:39.970 --> 00:57:39.980 align:start position:0%
one like first round one from the
 
00:57:42.650 --> 00:57:42.660 align:start position:0%
2018-2019 was not held over for this
 
00:57:44.089 --> 00:57:44.099 align:start position:0%
list this so this is technically
 
00:57:46.790 --> 00:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
two three four I don't even know
 
00:57:51.770 --> 00:57:51.780 align:start position:0%
um but when we opened it up this summer
 
00:57:53.809 --> 00:57:53.819 align:start position:0%
um round one and round two were are both
 
00:57:55.670 --> 00:57:55.680 align:start position:0%
in this comprehensive list just round
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
two references to one round one column
 
00:57:58.619 --> 00:58:02.450 align:start position:0%
two references to one round one column
yes

00:58:02.450 --> 00:58:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:05.450 --> 00:58:05.460 align:start position:0%
so if I go to the last page bottom right
 
00:58:07.490 --> 00:58:07.500 align:start position:0%
hand corner that's the 21 million
 
00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:08.510 align:start position:0%
hand corner that's the 21 million
dollars

00:58:08.510 --> 00:58:08.520 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
shortfall that has not been funded at
 
00:58:12.589 --> 00:58:12.599 align:start position:0%
this time yes
 
00:58:14.109 --> 00:58:14.119 align:start position:0%
my question
 
00:58:16.790 --> 00:58:16.800 align:start position:0%
this is more procedural question I guess
 
00:58:18.589 --> 00:58:18.599 align:start position:0%
because there's no way if we really know
 
00:58:20.930 --> 00:58:20.940 align:start position:0%
the answer but it seems to me if a
 
00:58:23.750 --> 00:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
school if the DHS comes into a school
 
00:58:27.410 --> 00:58:27.420 align:start position:0%
and provides them a report on security
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
you know
 
00:58:32.210 --> 00:58:32.220 align:start position:0%
they hand it to them
 
00:58:34.730 --> 00:58:34.740 align:start position:0%
and there's no funds available from the
 
00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:35.990 align:start position:0%
and there's no funds available from the
state

00:58:35.990 --> 00:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:58:38.809 --> 00:58:38.819 align:start position:0%
to do it it seems to me that a school
 
00:58:40.609 --> 00:58:40.619 align:start position:0%
district would be derelict
 
00:58:42.950 --> 00:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
by not doing the best they could to
 
00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
execute what VHS gave them I'm asking a
 
00:58:48.349 --> 00:58:48.359 align:start position:0%
question just because it seems
 
00:58:49.910 --> 00:58:49.920 align:start position:0%
and I don't I don't know what that
 
00:58:52.190 --> 00:58:52.200 align:start position:0%
process is I'm not even sure what um
 
00:58:54.170 --> 00:58:54.180 align:start position:0%
Homeland Security gives them
 
00:58:56.390 --> 00:58:56.400 align:start position:0%
it's a security assessment that I think
 
00:58:58.730 --> 00:58:58.740 align:start position:0%
I I I think this might be a great
 
00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:01.920 align:start position:0%
question for Homeland Security but I
 
00:59:04.910 --> 00:59:04.920 align:start position:0%
just don't know the details yeah I'm
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
just curious because if you're if once
 
00:59:09.829 --> 00:59:09.839 align:start position:0%
you're given a report that says you've
 
00:59:12.349 --> 00:59:12.359 align:start position:0%
got to do a b and c and if you don't do
 
00:59:14.450 --> 00:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
a b and c and something happens
 
00:59:17.089 --> 00:59:17.099 align:start position:0%
it seems to me you have a certain
 
00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:20.700 align:start position:0%
negligent liability in that I'm not a
 
00:59:22.250 --> 00:59:22.260 align:start position:0%
lawyer I'm just saying
 
00:59:23.930 --> 00:59:23.940 align:start position:0%
holy mackerel
 
00:59:23.940 --> 00:59:25.010 align:start position:0%
holy mackerel
Mary

00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
Mary
 
00:59:27.470 --> 00:59:27.480 align:start position:0%
I believe in our
 
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
in our infrastructure committee we we
 
00:59:31.970 --> 00:59:31.980 align:start position:0%
talked about when the homeland security
 
00:59:34.789 --> 00:59:34.799 align:start position:0%
goes out and assesses the need that
 
00:59:37.069 --> 00:59:37.079 align:start position:0%
bumps them up on the
 
00:59:39.289 --> 00:59:39.299 align:start position:0%
um I believe they did use that as one of
 
00:59:42.829 --> 00:59:42.839 align:start position:0%
the criteria criteria oh okay so um the
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
work that they're doing is really
 
00:59:45.589 --> 00:59:45.599 align:start position:0%
wonderful and they've been helping
 
00:59:48.349 --> 00:59:48.359 align:start position:0%
schools for a long time so I think it
 
00:59:53.089 --> 00:59:53.099 align:start position:0%
does have input into what happens
 
00:59:53.099 --> 00:59:54.589 align:start position:0%
does have input into what happens
question

00:59:54.589 --> 00:59:54.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:59:57.049 --> 00:59:57.059 align:start position:0%
can I just to follow up on the you know
 
00:59:59.329 --> 00:59:59.339 align:start position:0%
potential failure to act as an adhes
 
00:59:59.339 --> 01:00:00.890 align:start position:0%
potential failure to act as an adhes
finding

01:00:00.890 --> 01:00:00.900 align:start position:0%
finding
 
01:00:03.710 --> 01:00:03.720 align:start position:0%
um if I recall correctly the DHS you
 
01:00:05.750 --> 01:00:05.760 align:start position:0%
know comes in when invited right you
 
01:00:07.730 --> 01:00:07.740 align:start position:0%
don't they don't just go through the
 
01:00:09.650 --> 01:00:09.660 align:start position:0%
schools without asking first the school
 
01:00:11.630 --> 01:00:11.640 align:start position:0%
has to say I would like to be assist or
 
01:00:14.089 --> 01:00:14.099 align:start position:0%
was it a every school got inspected so
 
01:00:16.069 --> 01:00:16.079 align:start position:0%
every school is required just just an
 
01:00:19.150 --> 01:00:19.160 align:start position:0%
emergency operation plan
 
01:00:22.789 --> 01:00:22.799 align:start position:0%
I as far as the review process for the
 
01:00:25.010 --> 01:00:25.020 align:start position:0%
Emergency operation plan again that's a
 
01:00:27.410 --> 01:00:27.420 align:start position:0%
homeland security question
 
01:00:29.210 --> 01:00:29.220 align:start position:0%
um and then they also additionally on
 
01:00:32.210 --> 01:00:32.220 align:start position:0%
top of the emergency operation plan they
 
01:00:35.809 --> 01:00:35.819 align:start position:0%
do offer a security Assessment program
 
01:00:38.569 --> 01:00:38.579 align:start position:0%
um that is separate from the emergency
 
01:00:41.329 --> 01:00:41.339 align:start position:0%
operation plan process that is a
 
01:00:43.910 --> 01:00:43.920 align:start position:0%
required report that they must submit
 
01:00:48.829 --> 01:00:48.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:51.470 --> 01:00:51.480 align:start position:0%
now I I'm asking because I remember that
 
01:00:52.789 --> 01:00:52.799 align:start position:0%
you know when I was in the school board
 
01:00:55.730 --> 01:00:55.740 align:start position:0%
we asked you know we we didn't just they
 
01:00:57.589 --> 01:00:57.599 align:start position:0%
didn't just come by without being asked
 
01:01:00.049 --> 01:01:00.059 align:start position:0%
so in that sense I would say that most
 
01:01:02.270 --> 01:01:02.280 align:start position:0%
schools that are asking are probably
 
01:01:03.890 --> 01:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
already concerned and they're trying to
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
figure out you know how best to address
 
01:01:09.109 --> 01:01:09.119 align:start position:0%
so uh I wouldn't be very worried about
 
01:01:10.970 --> 01:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
any school who already asked for an
 
01:01:12.829 --> 01:01:12.839 align:start position:0%
assessment showing concern then choosing
 
01:01:14.329 --> 01:01:14.339 align:start position:0%
not to act I mean there may be
 
01:01:15.890 --> 01:01:15.900 align:start position:0%
situations where they cannot get a
 
01:01:18.530 --> 01:01:18.540 align:start position:0%
warrant article passed or whatnot or
 
01:01:20.569 --> 01:01:20.579 align:start position:0%
maybe there are disagreements that the
 
01:01:22.549 --> 01:01:22.559 align:start position:0%
issue is not that big or something but I
 
01:01:24.349 --> 01:01:24.359 align:start position:0%
would I would guess that that's a very
 
01:01:27.410 --> 01:01:27.420 align:start position:0%
rare type of situation
 
01:01:27.420 --> 01:01:28.609 align:start position:0%
rare type of situation
uh

01:01:28.609 --> 01:01:28.619 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:01:30.349 --> 01:01:30.359 align:start position:0%
I mean if the committee has time I know
 
01:01:32.329 --> 01:01:32.339 align:start position:0%
you're very crunched on time and just
 
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
just let Mickey know and I can tell him
 
01:01:35.510 --> 01:01:35.520 align:start position:0%
who the appropriate contacts at Homeland
 
01:01:37.010 --> 01:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
Security that could come in and talk to
 
01:01:38.569 --> 01:01:38.579 align:start position:0%
you about that but
 
01:01:38.579 --> 01:01:40.370 align:start position:0%
you about that but
it's

01:01:40.370 --> 01:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
it's
 
01:01:40.380 --> 01:01:41.589 align:start position:0%
it's
oh

01:01:41.589 --> 01:01:41.599 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:01:44.390 --> 01:01:44.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:01:47.089 --> 01:01:47.099 align:start position:0%
we got so much to do I mean I think
 
01:01:48.650 --> 01:01:48.660 align:start position:0%
you're representing you need it is
 
01:01:51.770 --> 01:01:51.780 align:start position:0%
sufficient for me I believe you no
 
01:01:54.890 --> 01:01:54.900 align:start position:0%
problem uh I I'll give you a little
 
01:01:58.069 --> 01:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
anecdote our church applied for a
 
01:02:01.609 --> 01:02:01.619 align:start position:0%
Federal grant for security under it's a
 
01:02:01.619 --> 01:02:03.609 align:start position:0%
Federal grant for security under it's a
a

01:02:03.609 --> 01:02:03.619 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
501c3 program
 
01:02:10.130 --> 01:02:10.140 align:start position:0%
and we've got as a pilot we were awarded
 
01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:13.619 align:start position:0%
a grant for security doors you know and
 
01:02:17.030 --> 01:02:17.040 align:start position:0%
keypad these little puppies instead of
 
01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:18.530 align:start position:0%
keypad these little puppies instead of
keys

01:02:18.530 --> 01:02:18.540 align:start position:0%
keys
 
01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.370 align:start position:0%
keys
um

01:02:19.370 --> 01:02:19.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:02:22.010 --> 01:02:22.020 align:start position:0%
and we got the grant
 
01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:24.180 align:start position:0%
but we can't find anybody to install the
 
01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.089 align:start position:0%
but we can't find anybody to install the
doors

01:02:25.089 --> 01:02:25.099 align:start position:0%
doors
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
and it's been seven months we've been
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
trying to find somebody to come install
 
01:02:33.430 --> 01:02:33.440 align:start position:0%
these doors but we can't
 
01:02:35.990 --> 01:02:36.000 align:start position:0%
it's a reimbursement Grant up to a
 
01:02:37.130 --> 01:02:37.140 align:start position:0%
certain amount so we've got to get the
 
01:02:39.950 --> 01:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
doors installed before we before we can
 
01:02:42.650 --> 01:02:42.660 align:start position:0%
apply for them and that's exactly the
 
01:02:44.030 --> 01:02:44.040 align:start position:0%
way that this grant works too and we
 
01:02:46.069 --> 01:02:46.079 align:start position:0%
have had some schools tell us that exact
 
01:02:48.349 --> 01:02:48.359 align:start position:0%
same story and schools have through the
 
01:02:50.210 --> 01:02:50.220 align:start position:0%
end of June to obligate the funding or
 
01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:52.200 align:start position:0%
the funding is basically reverted back
 
01:02:53.270 --> 01:02:53.280 align:start position:0%
to us even though we've never
 
01:02:55.609 --> 01:02:55.619 align:start position:0%
distributed it to the school and we will
 
01:03:01.809 --> 01:03:01.819 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:06.230 --> 01:03:06.240 align:start position:0%
in small towns that have tight budgets
 
01:03:09.470 --> 01:03:09.480 align:start position:0%
um it's really hard when you get a grant
 
01:03:12.049 --> 01:03:12.059 align:start position:0%
a large Grant from the state that you
 
01:03:13.490 --> 01:03:13.500 align:start position:0%
want to spend and you have a legitimate
 
01:03:15.710 --> 01:03:15.720 align:start position:0%
reason to spend but sometimes their
 
01:03:18.109 --> 01:03:18.119 align:start position:0%
budgets are so little that they can't
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
spend all those dollars first and get
 
01:03:23.289 --> 01:03:23.299 align:start position:0%
reimbursed it really it can be tough
 
01:03:26.210 --> 01:03:26.220 align:start position:0%
yes yep yep I'm fully funded but I can't
 
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:31.849 --> 01:03:31.859 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions
 
01:03:33.349 --> 01:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
do you have any other areas you'd like
 
01:03:33.359 --> 01:03:34.010 align:start position:0%
do you have any other areas you'd like
to

01:03:34.010 --> 01:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:03:34.020 --> 01:03:35.329 align:start position:0%
to
oh

01:03:35.329 --> 01:03:35.339 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:03:35.339 --> 01:03:38.870 align:start position:0%
oh
so

01:03:38.870 --> 01:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:57.890 --> 01:03:57.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.170 --> 01:04:00.180 align:start position:0%
okay Department of Education so
 
01:04:01.910 --> 01:04:01.920 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
 
01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.870 align:start position:0%
infrastructure fund
um

01:04:05.870 --> 01:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
I can talk about the accountability
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
position and relative to that work so
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
this would be sorry in center of line 43
 
01:04:21.109 --> 01:04:21.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:24.289 --> 01:04:24.299 align:start position:0%
um so last week or actually earlier this
 
01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:26.339 align:start position:0%
week at the end of um Tuesday or
 
01:04:28.130 --> 01:04:28.140 align:start position:0%
Wednesday you had Mark here at the end
 
01:04:30.349 --> 01:04:30.359 align:start position:0%
of a long day and I think he gave you a
 
01:04:33.410 --> 01:04:33.420 align:start position:0%
lot of information very very quickly
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
um so hopefully he uh didn't go too
 
01:04:35.640 --> 01:04:36.770 align:start position:0%
um so hopefully he uh didn't go too
quick

01:04:36.770 --> 01:04:36.780 align:start position:0%
quick
 
01:04:39.890 --> 01:04:39.900 align:start position:0%
um but one of his I think he expressed
 
01:04:43.150 --> 01:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
some concerns and some comments about
 
01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:46.020 align:start position:0%
accountability plans and some of the
 
01:04:48.170 --> 01:04:48.180 align:start position:0%
information and some of the grant
 
01:04:49.730 --> 01:04:49.740 align:start position:0%
proposals and what not coming to you
 
01:04:51.950 --> 01:04:51.960 align:start position:0%
relative to some bills and
 
01:04:53.089 --> 01:04:53.099 align:start position:0%
um so one of the things that the
 
01:04:54.650 --> 01:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has asked for is
 
01:04:56.450 --> 01:04:56.460 align:start position:0%
for an administrator to oversee
 
01:04:59.030 --> 01:04:59.040 align:start position:0%
accountability plans so
 
01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:01.319 align:start position:0%
um we did not ask the governor for this
 
01:05:03.589 --> 01:05:03.599 align:start position:0%
originally in our legisl in our proposal
 
01:05:05.329 --> 01:05:05.339 align:start position:0%
we it
 
01:05:07.910 --> 01:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
um timing wise it we hadn't even
 
01:05:11.270 --> 01:05:11.280 align:start position:0%
so accountability plans first passed um
 
01:05:13.130 --> 01:05:13.140 align:start position:0%
as part of the extraordinary needs
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
grants process that was passed over the
 
01:05:17.210 --> 01:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
summer and we began implementing this
 
01:05:18.770 --> 01:05:18.780 align:start position:0%
fall and it was just timing wise we
 
01:05:20.329 --> 01:05:20.339 align:start position:0%
didn't even have an opportunity to ask
 
01:05:23.089 --> 01:05:23.099 align:start position:0%
the governor for in our budget so we are
 
01:05:25.370 --> 01:05:25.380 align:start position:0%
asking now
 
01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
um and I think part of this is you know
 
01:05:30.170 --> 01:05:30.180 align:start position:0%
what the committee is going to do with
 
01:05:31.789 --> 01:05:31.799 align:start position:0%
the funding formula and the
 
01:05:34.789 --> 01:05:34.799 align:start position:0%
accountability needs plans is um
 
01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:37.680 align:start position:0%
a part of this uh but so just for
 
01:05:39.530 --> 01:05:39.540 align:start position:0%
example the department of education is
 
01:05:41.390 --> 01:05:41.400 align:start position:0%
required to collect an accountability
 
01:05:43.490 --> 01:05:43.500 align:start position:0%
accountability plan for the
 
01:05:45.589 --> 01:05:45.599 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grants this is a new
 
01:05:47.329 --> 01:05:47.339 align:start position:0%
requirement because extraordinary needs
 
01:05:49.010 --> 01:05:49.020 align:start position:0%
grants which are an adequacy formula are
 
01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:49.849 align:start position:0%
grants which are an adequacy formula are
new

01:05:49.849 --> 01:05:49.859 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:05:53.210 --> 01:05:53.220 align:start position:0%
um just a reminder that Grant is
 
01:05:53.220 --> 01:05:53.870 align:start position:0%
um just a reminder that Grant is
um

01:05:53.870 --> 01:05:53.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:05:55.670 --> 01:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
a grant that it goes through school
 
01:05:57.410 --> 01:05:57.420 align:start position:0%
districts that have a high percentage of
 
01:06:00.829 --> 01:06:00.839 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch pupils to a low
 
01:06:03.170 --> 01:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation so it's specifically
 
01:06:06.650 --> 01:06:06.660 align:start position:0%
targets towns like Berlin a town like
 
01:06:08.569 --> 01:06:08.579 align:start position:0%
Bedford wouldn't necessarily receive
 
01:06:10.549 --> 01:06:10.559 align:start position:0%
these funding with even though Bedford
 
01:06:12.890 --> 01:06:12.900 align:start position:0%
has a low equalized valuation they still
 
01:06:14.990 --> 01:06:15.000 align:start position:0%
have a high free and reduced lot or
 
01:06:16.789 --> 01:06:16.799 align:start position:0%
sorry they have a low equalized
 
01:06:18.470 --> 01:06:18.480 align:start position:0%
valuation but a low free and reduced
 
01:06:21.049 --> 01:06:21.059 align:start position:0%
lunch number so it's a new Grant it was
 
01:06:23.210 --> 01:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
um chiefly a priority of Senator
 
01:06:25.670 --> 01:06:25.680 align:start position:0%
Hennessey last year it was passed in our
 
01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:26.930 align:start position:0%
Hennessey last year it was passed in our
budget

01:06:26.930 --> 01:06:26.940 align:start position:0%
budget
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
um and then extraordinary accountability
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
plans were added as an amendment last
 
01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:33.980 align:start position:0%
minute in the committee of conference
 
01:06:36.589 --> 01:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
to the Department's requirement for
 
01:06:38.029 --> 01:06:38.039 align:start position:0%
these grants
 
01:06:40.250 --> 01:06:40.260 align:start position:0%
collecting these plans and managing
 
01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:42.420 align:start position:0%
these plans was an extraordinary feat
 
01:06:44.270 --> 01:06:44.280 align:start position:0%
for the Department this fall I would say
 
01:06:47.930 --> 01:06:47.940 align:start position:0%
collectively across myself my data team
 
01:06:50.750 --> 01:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
Mark and my accountability team probably
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
spent a thousand hours just trying to
 
01:06:55.250 --> 01:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
explain to school districts the need for
 
01:06:58.490 --> 01:06:58.500 align:start position:0%
the plans developing the templates some
 
01:07:00.710 --> 01:07:00.720 align:start position:0%
of the tax implications of this work
 
01:07:03.049 --> 01:07:03.059 align:start position:0%
because of the timing the funding what
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
could go back to
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
reduce taxes but you still had to do an
 
01:07:09.349 --> 01:07:09.359 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs plan and talk about
 
01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
what you were doing for accountability
 
01:07:13.190 --> 01:07:13.200 align:start position:0%
and your school district was that
 
01:07:15.230 --> 01:07:15.240 align:start position:0%
that and explaining that alone was
 
01:07:18.170 --> 01:07:18.180 align:start position:0%
confusing at best and now you know on
 
01:07:19.190 --> 01:07:19.200 align:start position:0%
the other side of things we have
 
01:07:21.289 --> 01:07:21.299 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs plans that should be
 
01:07:23.150 --> 01:07:23.160 align:start position:0%
probably reviewed and worked through
 
01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:24.660 align:start position:0%
with the school districts and we just
 
01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:26.520 align:start position:0%
don't have the capacity to do that staff
 
01:07:28.490 --> 01:07:28.500 align:start position:0%
so we have kind of maintained this
 
01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.109 align:start position:0%
so we have kind of maintained this
position

01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:07:32.569 --> 01:07:32.579 align:start position:0%
to that we need a position
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
um to barely be able to implement the
 
01:07:37.609 --> 01:07:37.619 align:start position:0%
plans if the it is the decision of your
 
01:07:39.890 --> 01:07:39.900 align:start position:0%
committee to continue to require the
 
01:07:41.510 --> 01:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to do
 
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
accountability plans as part of
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs or now some of these
 
01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:47.160 align:start position:0%
other proposals that are coming over
 
01:07:49.670 --> 01:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
from House Education
 
01:07:51.529 --> 01:07:51.539 align:start position:0%
but one option would be to suspend the
 
01:07:53.750 --> 01:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
plans one auction would be to suspend
 
01:07:55.370 --> 01:07:55.380 align:start position:0%
the plans the department will support
 
01:07:59.150 --> 01:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
either one of those positions so send I
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
can't say that word suspend the plans or
 
01:08:04.130 --> 01:08:04.140 align:start position:0%
give us a position to do that work
 
01:08:06.710 --> 01:08:06.720 align:start position:0%
who looks at the once it's done
 
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
who looks at it well the department
 
01:08:10.309 --> 01:08:10.319 align:start position:0%
should but we don't have a staff person
 
01:08:12.549 --> 01:08:12.559 align:start position:0%
to do that and that person right now
 
01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
we as we don't have anybody that can do
 
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
that work
 
01:08:18.349 --> 01:08:18.359 align:start position:0%
so we're doing these great plans and I
 
01:08:19.789 --> 01:08:19.799 align:start position:0%
know and there's no
 
01:08:22.729 --> 01:08:22.739 align:start position:0%
that's correct okay Mary
 
01:08:24.229 --> 01:08:24.239 align:start position:0%
and it's my interest in being school
 
01:08:26.150 --> 01:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
districts aren't real happy about having
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
to do them either they were not very
 
01:08:29.749 --> 01:08:29.759 align:start position:0%
happy it was um it wasn't even that they
 
01:08:31.370 --> 01:08:31.380 align:start position:0%
were happy it was just very confusing
 
01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
and it was
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
um a very quick turnaround because so
 
01:08:36.950 --> 01:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
the the challenge was is that the
 
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
Department of Education has to do an
 
01:08:43.430 --> 01:08:43.440 align:start position:0%
estimate for schools on October 1st and
 
01:08:45.890 --> 01:08:45.900 align:start position:0%
that October 1st estimate of adequacy or
 
01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:47.100 align:start position:0%
it's an IU estimate It's the final
 
01:08:49.729 --> 01:08:49.739 align:start position:0%
calculation includes extraordinary needs
 
01:08:51.709 --> 01:08:51.719 align:start position:0%
Grant and that is what your tax rate is
 
01:08:53.990 --> 01:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
set on we give that to dra they take it
 
01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:56.100 align:start position:0%
and they said the tax rates
 
01:08:58.189 --> 01:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
then the school district to be eligible
 
01:09:00.050 --> 01:09:00.060 align:start position:0%
for that had to do extraordinary needs
 
01:09:01.789 --> 01:09:01.799 align:start position:0%
plan and so they had to tell us whether
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
they were going to do the plan or not we
 
01:09:06.890 --> 01:09:06.900 align:start position:0%
gave them past that deadline to do that
 
01:09:09.050 --> 01:09:09.060 align:start position:0%
um but that was very confusing it was
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
just an entirely new thing that happened
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
too quickly
 
01:09:13.189 --> 01:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
um and the school districts are trying
 
01:09:14.390 --> 01:09:14.400 align:start position:0%
to wrap their heads around what we were
 
01:09:16.130 --> 01:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
trying to tell them which didn't make
 
01:09:18.650 --> 01:09:18.660 align:start position:0%
any sense compared to any other Grant or
 
01:09:20.209 --> 01:09:20.219 align:start position:0%
anything we received in the best because
 
01:09:21.349 --> 01:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
there's never been a reporting
 
01:09:23.150 --> 01:09:23.160 align:start position:0%
requirement required for any funding
 
01:09:25.370 --> 01:09:25.380 align:start position:0%
that goes for the October 1st tax rate
 
01:09:28.550 --> 01:09:28.560 align:start position:0%
so quickly so and there was nothing that
 
01:09:29.990 --> 01:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
came out of the committee of conference
 
01:09:32.930 --> 01:09:32.940 align:start position:0%
other than our accountability plan was
 
01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:34.309 align:start position:0%
other than our accountability plan was
required

01:09:34.309 --> 01:09:34.319 align:start position:0%
required
 
01:09:37.669 --> 01:09:37.679 align:start position:0%
um and the money to establishment had to
 
01:09:40.189 --> 01:09:40.199 align:start position:0%
develop all the criteria
 
01:09:42.410 --> 01:09:42.420 align:start position:0%
Etc so it was a hardship for you it's a
 
01:09:44.809 --> 01:09:44.819 align:start position:0%
hardship for the school districts it was
 
01:09:47.090 --> 01:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
wonderful money for the communities that
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
obtained it
 
01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:50.930 align:start position:0%
obtained it
um

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:53.630 --> 01:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
and we don't even have in the governor's
 
01:09:55.490 --> 01:09:55.500 align:start position:0%
budget I believe Mickey there isn't
 
01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:56.930 align:start position:0%
budget I believe Mickey there isn't
extraordinary

01:09:56.930 --> 01:09:56.940 align:start position:0%
extraordinary
 
01:09:58.610 --> 01:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
there are extraordinary needs grants
 
01:10:00.890 --> 01:10:00.900 align:start position:0%
relief funding it is this is bold yeah
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
and there is in House Bill 2 as well as
 
01:10:05.410 --> 01:10:05.420 align:start position:0%
uh house bill
 
01:10:07.490 --> 01:10:07.500 align:start position:0%
638 that we have retained some
 
01:10:09.709 --> 01:10:09.719 align:start position:0%
modifications to the accountability plan
 
01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
requirement I sent I think it sets a 50
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
000 threshold on when they're required
 
01:10:15.950 --> 01:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
yes yes I remember that so that that's
 
01:10:17.810 --> 01:10:17.820 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 that's in the bill that
 
01:10:19.850 --> 01:10:19.860 align:start position:0%
we've retained I think even with those
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
sections passed the department still is
 
01:10:25.610 --> 01:10:25.620 align:start position:0%
seeking someone to oversee uh I don't
 
01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
know if you want to speak to the change
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
that's proposed and helpful too at all
 
01:10:31.189 --> 01:10:31.199 align:start position:0%
um from the governor's proposal so the
 
01:10:32.930 --> 01:10:32.940 align:start position:0%
governor's proposal for House Bill 2
 
01:10:35.630 --> 01:10:35.640 align:start position:0%
actually does include externally so it
 
01:10:37.189 --> 01:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
the governor's funding proposal
 
01:10:39.709 --> 01:10:39.719 align:start position:0%
simplifies the adequacy formula um sorry
 
01:10:40.970 --> 01:10:40.980 align:start position:0%
it's just the account just
 
01:10:43.070 --> 01:10:43.080 align:start position:0%
accountability well okay so not the
 
01:10:44.450 --> 01:10:44.460 align:start position:0%
expanding experience or in your news
 
01:10:47.209 --> 01:10:47.219 align:start position:0%
grants okay um so the one of the things
 
01:10:49.850 --> 01:10:49.860 align:start position:0%
that we asked is basically a floor for
 
01:10:52.070 --> 01:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
submitting accountability needs uh
 
01:10:54.110 --> 01:10:54.120 align:start position:0%
accountability as plans for school
 
01:10:57.290 --> 01:10:57.300 align:start position:0%
districts so school districts
 
01:10:59.810 --> 01:10:59.820 align:start position:0%
um if it wasn't you know we didn't know
 
01:11:01.430 --> 01:11:01.440 align:start position:0%
if it was pal we didn't want to ask the
 
01:11:04.790 --> 01:11:04.800 align:start position:0%
legislature on our own to remove the
 
01:11:06.470 --> 01:11:06.480 align:start position:0%
accountability plans we felt that you
 
01:11:08.390 --> 01:11:08.400 align:start position:0%
guys wrote that into law and you felt
 
01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:11.400 align:start position:0%
that ex the accountability plans was a
 
01:11:13.430 --> 01:11:13.440 align:start position:0%
priority for you for you all um when you
 
01:11:14.810 --> 01:11:14.820 align:start position:0%
put that in
 
01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:15.709 align:start position:0%
put that in
um

01:11:15.709 --> 01:11:15.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:17.930 --> 01:11:17.940 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're saying we need the
 
01:11:19.790 --> 01:11:19.800 align:start position:0%
support to do this but if you have made
 
01:11:22.669 --> 01:11:22.679 align:start position:0%
that conclusion on your own great
 
01:11:22.679 --> 01:11:23.209 align:start position:0%
that conclusion on your own great
um

01:11:23.209 --> 01:11:23.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:26.090 --> 01:11:26.100 align:start position:0%
but what we have asked for is at a
 
01:11:29.090 --> 01:11:29.100 align:start position:0%
minimum if a school is required to do a
 
01:11:31.070 --> 01:11:31.080 align:start position:0%
plan put a floor in place because we had
 
01:11:33.410 --> 01:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
schools that did a plan and spent a lot
 
01:11:35.689 --> 01:11:35.699 align:start position:0%
of Staff hours putting together a plan
 
01:11:38.450 --> 01:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
for a few thousand dollars and that did
 
01:11:41.510 --> 01:11:41.520 align:start position:0%
not seem to be a good use of time at the
 
01:11:43.070 --> 01:11:43.080 align:start position:0%
department especially you had a school
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
saying I'm only getting fifteen hundred
 
01:11:46.669 --> 01:11:46.679 align:start position:0%
dollars or I'm getting fifteen thousand
 
01:11:47.930 --> 01:11:47.940 align:start position:0%
dollars how can I actually really
 
01:11:49.790 --> 01:11:49.800 align:start position:0%
Implement a plan
 
01:11:51.530 --> 01:11:51.540 align:start position:0%
um that really makes sense and we said
 
01:11:54.050 --> 01:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
well there's no floor required so can we
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
eliminate at least some of these plans
 
01:11:57.770 --> 01:11:57.780 align:start position:0%
for the school districts that are
 
01:11:59.330 --> 01:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
they're getting smaller portions of
 
01:12:02.570 --> 01:12:02.580 align:start position:0%
funding how does it report on so the
 
01:12:05.149 --> 01:12:05.159 align:start position:0%
report is on the
 
01:12:07.729 --> 01:12:07.739 align:start position:0%
um performance of the schools so it
 
01:12:09.950 --> 01:12:09.960 align:start position:0%
looks at each grade level and how the
 
01:12:12.229 --> 01:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
kids are performing it looks at growth
 
01:12:15.410 --> 01:12:15.420 align:start position:0%
over time which is how much a kid is
 
01:12:17.810 --> 01:12:17.820 align:start position:0%
able to grow in a period of time so
 
01:12:19.310 --> 01:12:19.320 align:start position:0%
you're able to start here and you're
 
01:12:20.689 --> 01:12:20.699 align:start position:0%
able to get here or you're able to start
 
01:12:22.430 --> 01:12:22.440 align:start position:0%
here and get here and then achievement
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
which is a stagnant they're achieving at
 
01:12:26.689 --> 01:12:26.699 align:start position:0%
this level or they're level one or level
 
01:12:28.669 --> 01:12:28.679 align:start position:0%
two or things so you're like all right
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
this is a kid that's always level three
 
01:12:33.290 --> 01:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
this is how they are or last year the
 
01:12:35.330 --> 01:12:35.340 align:start position:0%
kid was level two now this year's level
 
01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:37.320 align:start position:0%
three that means the kid the child has
 
01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
grown so it looks at different metrics
 
01:12:42.890 --> 01:12:42.900 align:start position:0%
and it looks at performance and laying
 
01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
English Math and Science and it looks at
 
01:12:49.370 --> 01:12:49.380 align:start position:0%
how it looks at we did it based on grade
 
01:12:52.130 --> 01:12:52.140 align:start position:0%
levels and we broke that down using data
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
that already exists at the Department of
 
01:12:56.390 --> 01:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
Education that were required to submit
 
01:12:58.490 --> 01:12:58.500 align:start position:0%
for other air sorry collect for other
 
01:13:00.890 --> 01:13:00.900 align:start position:0%
areas of state and federal law and then
 
01:13:02.930 --> 01:13:02.940 align:start position:0%
we ask school districts how they were
 
01:13:04.270 --> 01:13:04.280 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:13:07.669 --> 01:13:07.679 align:start position:0%
continue to support growth and improve
 
01:13:10.550 --> 01:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
growth and achievement across those
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
different grade levels and areas and so
 
01:13:17.209 --> 01:13:17.219 align:start position:0%
are these for special needs no for all
 
01:13:20.090 --> 01:13:20.100 align:start position:0%
students yep and they had to select how
 
01:13:21.350 --> 01:13:21.360 align:start position:0%
they had to create targets so some
 
01:13:23.810 --> 01:13:23.820 align:start position:0%
school districts set a target of 1 other
 
01:13:25.610 --> 01:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
school districts send set more lofty
 
01:13:27.649 --> 01:13:27.659 align:start position:0%
goals but as of right now there's no
 
01:13:28.850 --> 01:13:28.860 align:start position:0%
requirement for the Department of
 
01:13:31.610 --> 01:13:31.620 align:start position:0%
Education to kind of review that or talk
 
01:13:33.890 --> 01:13:33.900 align:start position:0%
to schools or work with schools to say
 
01:13:35.630 --> 01:13:35.640 align:start position:0%
like this is an achievable goal and
 
01:13:37.790 --> 01:13:37.800 align:start position:0%
whatnot all right
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Caitlin do they have
 
01:13:42.229 --> 01:13:42.239 align:start position:0%
to tie the dollars to the achievement
 
01:13:44.810 --> 01:13:44.820 align:start position:0%
because in some places like you said it
 
01:13:46.490 --> 01:13:46.500 align:start position:0%
was very little but in a place like
 
01:13:50.810 --> 01:13:50.820 align:start position:0%
Manchester it was I think 4.7 and 2.7
 
01:13:54.649 --> 01:13:54.659 align:start position:0%
um so so it wasn't we didn't set it up
 
01:13:56.570 --> 01:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
in a way that was so prescriptive like a
 
01:13:58.250 --> 01:13:58.260 align:start position:0%
Federal grant where you had to go in and
 
01:13:59.450 --> 01:13:59.460 align:start position:0%
say I'm going to pay a teacher and the
 
01:14:01.390 --> 01:14:01.400 align:start position:0%
teacher is specifically going to help
 
01:14:04.669 --> 01:14:04.679 align:start position:0%
Mentor kids and science whatever
 
01:14:04.679 --> 01:14:05.330 align:start position:0%
Mentor kids and science whatever
um

01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:08.270 --> 01:14:08.280 align:start position:0%
but we did say we did have to say our
 
01:14:10.550 --> 01:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
goal is you know we're going to do
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
we are going to hire a math teacher or
 
01:14:16.430 --> 01:14:16.440 align:start position:0%
tutor or to improve math scores so some
 
01:14:17.510 --> 01:14:17.520 align:start position:0%
high level
 
01:14:20.030 --> 01:14:20.040 align:start position:0%
um some correlation but not to the
 
01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:21.900 align:start position:0%
extent that we do for other Grant work
 
01:14:23.390 --> 01:14:23.400 align:start position:0%
because that's a lot of reporting but
 
01:14:24.830 --> 01:14:24.840 align:start position:0%
they could probably use some of their
 
01:14:28.790 --> 01:14:28.800 align:start position:0%
Title One reporting to direct it that
 
01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
way I suppose
 
01:14:33.709 --> 01:14:33.719 align:start position:0%
no no probably not because that's just
 
01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:35.280 align:start position:0%
photography yeah I'd say so title one is
 
01:14:37.490 --> 01:14:37.500 align:start position:0%
so prescriptive and it's a very strong
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
supplement not so plants that's a lot of
 
01:14:41.090 --> 01:14:41.100 align:start position:0%
reporting though for school district yes
 
01:14:44.030 --> 01:14:44.040 align:start position:0%
it is for a small amount of money even
 
01:14:46.130 --> 01:14:46.140 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars
 
01:14:47.870 --> 01:14:47.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean we struggled with what is
 
01:14:50.510 --> 01:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
the appropriate floor and we saw 50 000
 
01:14:52.550 --> 01:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
it's a round number but I actually think
 
01:14:54.890 --> 01:14:54.900 align:start position:0%
the cheers idea might be a good one yeah
 
01:14:58.370 --> 01:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
because it sounds to me and I'll reckon
 
01:15:00.110 --> 01:15:00.120 align:start position:0%
you just say it sounds to me like it was
 
01:15:02.270 --> 01:15:02.280 align:start position:0%
a really good idea and I'm sure it had
 
01:15:04.010 --> 01:15:04.020 align:start position:0%
really good intentions
 
01:15:06.649 --> 01:15:06.659 align:start position:0%
but if if somebody's doing a report that
 
01:15:09.350 --> 01:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
nobody looks at it's like why are we
 
01:15:11.390 --> 01:15:11.400 align:start position:0%
going it's like a merry-go-round you
 
01:15:12.770 --> 01:15:12.780 align:start position:0%
know what's the point
 
01:15:15.830 --> 01:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and and that's why we thought well
 
01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature is saying that we this
 
01:15:19.010 --> 01:15:19.020 align:start position:0%
is a priority so we should just have a
 
01:15:20.570 --> 01:15:20.580 align:start position:0%
position so we can do that next step
 
01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:22.440 align:start position:0%
which is look at that report work with
 
01:15:23.330 --> 01:15:23.340 align:start position:0%
schools to make sure they're
 
01:15:27.010 --> 01:15:27.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
but it still sounds to me like
 
01:15:32.830 --> 01:15:32.840 align:start position:0%
you're doing that anyway
 
01:15:36.290 --> 01:15:36.300 align:start position:0%
in in some in some realm I mean it's not
 
01:15:38.330 --> 01:15:38.340 align:start position:0%
like we don't know you don't know what's
 
01:15:39.530 --> 01:15:39.540 align:start position:0%
going on
 
01:15:42.350 --> 01:15:42.360 align:start position:0%
all this is a formal
 
01:15:44.750 --> 01:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
presentation I'm assuming is structured
 
01:15:48.490 --> 01:15:48.500 align:start position:0%
somehow that you're being asking
 
01:15:51.169 --> 01:15:51.179 align:start position:0%
what you're asking for is you're asking
 
01:15:53.090 --> 01:15:53.100 align:start position:0%
to for the people that you're going to
 
01:15:55.310 --> 01:15:55.320 align:start position:0%
chastise to give you that information to
 
01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:56.880 align:start position:0%
get chastised
 
01:15:59.870 --> 01:15:59.880 align:start position:0%
all right so how stupid am I if I'm
 
01:16:02.270 --> 01:16:02.280 align:start position:0%
gonna give you information to get
 
01:16:05.169 --> 01:16:05.179 align:start position:0%
chastised you know you follow my logic
 
01:16:07.610 --> 01:16:07.620 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
01:16:10.790 --> 01:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
okay it's not working for me
 
01:16:14.510 --> 01:16:14.520 align:start position:0%
um yeah I wouldn't use chastise well I
 
01:16:15.470 --> 01:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
would think that we would want to
 
01:16:17.209 --> 01:16:17.219 align:start position:0%
provide them technical assistance and
 
01:16:19.010 --> 01:16:19.020 align:start position:0%
professional development around how to
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
improve their assessments
 
01:16:24.649 --> 01:16:24.659 align:start position:0%
but but again but the same rules apply
 
01:16:26.689 --> 01:16:26.699 align:start position:0%
if I
 
01:16:29.450 --> 01:16:29.460 align:start position:0%
if I have a deficiency
 
01:16:31.610 --> 01:16:31.620 align:start position:0%
is my inclination to report that
 
01:16:33.470 --> 01:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
deficiency or try to fix it myself or
 
01:16:36.110 --> 01:16:36.120 align:start position:0%
you know I'm I'm struggling here well
 
01:16:37.610 --> 01:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
and the one thing I do just want to
 
01:16:39.229 --> 01:16:39.239 align:start position:0%
point out is so the intention of the
 
01:16:39.239 --> 01:16:40.130 align:start position:0%
point out is so the intention of the
grant

01:16:40.130 --> 01:16:40.140 align:start position:0%
grant
 
01:16:44.330 --> 01:16:44.340 align:start position:0%
um was to help school districts with
 
01:16:48.050 --> 01:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
low free and reduced lunch and high
 
01:16:50.450 --> 01:16:50.460 align:start position:0%
sorry High free and reduced lunch and
 
01:16:52.370 --> 01:16:52.380 align:start position:0%
low equalized valuation per student
 
01:16:55.729 --> 01:16:55.739 align:start position:0%
which doesn't necessarily tie back to
 
01:16:58.130 --> 01:16:58.140 align:start position:0%
performance on the other side of things
 
01:17:00.830 --> 01:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
so if you had a grant that looked at
 
01:17:02.990 --> 01:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
school districts performance and were
 
01:17:05.090 --> 01:17:05.100 align:start position:0%
obligating funding to school districts
 
01:17:07.990 --> 01:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
that have poor performance and then
 
01:17:10.910 --> 01:17:10.920 align:start position:0%
requiring accountability that might make
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
more sense the Nexus might make a little
 
01:17:15.290 --> 01:17:15.300 align:start position:0%
bit more sense rather than a more money
 
01:17:17.570 --> 01:17:17.580 align:start position:0%
for these things over here which and I
 
01:17:19.850 --> 01:17:19.860 align:start position:0%
mean we certainly have data to look at
 
01:17:21.590 --> 01:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
the Department of Education at you know
 
01:17:23.209 --> 01:17:23.219 align:start position:0%
how are the kids How are schools
 
01:17:25.370 --> 01:17:25.380 align:start position:0%
performing that have high free and
 
01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:27.420 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch can you know I can looking
 
01:17:29.270 --> 01:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
at those assessment scores we can
 
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
certainly do that work but
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
um the Nexus between those two maybe not
 
01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:35.360 align:start position:0%
don't necessarily
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
this grant specifically don't doesn't
 
01:17:39.290 --> 01:17:39.300 align:start position:0%
make any sense Dan I think you were next
 
01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:42.000 align:start position:0%
in the queue yeah I am
 
01:17:45.169 --> 01:17:45.179 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask two questions uh one
 
01:17:47.270 --> 01:17:47.280 align:start position:0%
is a very quick and I think it was kind
 
01:17:50.030 --> 01:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
of already answered the reports are the
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
same regardless of the you know size of
 
01:17:55.130 --> 01:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
the correct right so basically every
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
school larger big has the same forms the
 
01:18:00.050 --> 01:18:00.060 align:start position:0%
same requirements the only decreasing
 
01:18:01.669 --> 01:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
complexity for a smaller school is that
 
01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:03.659 align:start position:0%
they would have fewer kids but the forms
 
01:18:05.450 --> 01:18:05.460 align:start position:0%
are the same so you know the labor is
 
01:18:08.570 --> 01:18:08.580 align:start position:0%
comparable obviously that's difficult I
 
01:18:10.070 --> 01:18:10.080 align:start position:0%
believe I made a remark when we
 
01:18:12.050 --> 01:18:12.060 align:start position:0%
originally were doing the public hearing
 
01:18:14.090 --> 01:18:14.100 align:start position:0%
that maybe an accountability plan for a
 
01:18:15.530 --> 01:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
small amount could be on the back of a
 
01:18:18.290 --> 01:18:18.300 align:start position:0%
napkin I guess uh no napkins standard
 
01:18:22.070 --> 01:18:22.080 align:start position:0%
reports yes understood so I think
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
representative Emrick was getting to
 
01:18:25.669 --> 01:18:25.679 align:start position:0%
this a little but I want the clear
 
01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:31.189 --> 01:18:31.199 align:start position:0%
would this funding ever stop being
 
01:18:33.950 --> 01:18:33.960 align:start position:0%
provided if the accountability plan uh
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
was not met not talking about reporting
 
01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:39.420 align:start position:0%
because I can report all day say that
 
01:18:41.330 --> 01:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
the school says I'm planning to achieve
 
01:18:42.890 --> 01:18:42.900 align:start position:0%
this goal they don't achieve this goal
 
01:18:44.450 --> 01:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
and every year they say I want to move
 
01:18:46.490 --> 01:18:46.500 align:start position:0%
the needle the needle never moves would
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
that lead to a loss of funding no the
 
01:18:49.370 --> 01:18:49.380 align:start position:0%
only thing that leads to a loss of
 
01:18:52.070 --> 01:18:52.080 align:start position:0%
funding is failure to do the report but
 
01:18:53.870 --> 01:18:53.880 align:start position:0%
the way that it is written into law
 
01:18:56.990 --> 01:18:57.000 align:start position:0%
right now is performance is not tied to
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
the ability to receive the funding and
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
that's the what I'm saying is
 
01:19:02.330 --> 01:19:02.340 align:start position:0%
performance is not tied to this funding
 
01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:04.980 align:start position:0%
got it so only the reporting is required
 
01:19:08.050 --> 01:19:08.060 align:start position:0%
understood so I will say this
 
01:19:11.510 --> 01:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
the whole offering Gateway based on
 
01:19:13.850 --> 01:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
performance to the possibility of not
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
receiving it based on performance is an
 
01:19:19.669 --> 01:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
amazingly complicated uh issue that I
 
01:19:22.189 --> 01:19:22.199 align:start position:0%
think we do not want to get into right
 
01:19:25.130 --> 01:19:25.140 align:start position:0%
now so I'll hold any remarks I may have
 
01:19:27.830 --> 01:19:27.840 align:start position:0%
had on that for hopefully way later
 
01:19:31.310 --> 01:19:31.320 align:start position:0%
but the way the accountability reporting
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
is done right now it's a piece of paper
 
01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
that you just need to file and mail in
 
01:19:37.189 --> 01:19:37.199 align:start position:0%
and it has no consequences to me that's
 
01:19:39.229 --> 01:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
not really accountability reporting and
 
01:19:41.450 --> 01:19:41.460 align:start position:0%
frankly the way it's implemented right
 
01:19:43.490 --> 01:19:43.500 align:start position:0%
now I don't think it's a good use of
 
01:19:46.910 --> 01:19:46.920 align:start position:0%
anybody's time and uh you know
 
01:19:48.890 --> 01:19:48.900 align:start position:0%
since I don't think that we have the
 
01:19:50.330 --> 01:19:50.340 align:start position:0%
time and effort to start the Thai
 
01:19:52.550 --> 01:19:52.560 align:start position:0%
funding to this nor is it something we
 
01:19:54.350 --> 01:19:54.360 align:start position:0%
should do with you know where we are in
 
01:19:56.030 --> 01:19:56.040 align:start position:0%
the process I think I'm pretty
 
01:19:58.430 --> 01:19:58.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable starting to instead of
 
01:20:00.890 --> 01:20:00.900 align:start position:0%
sticking with a 50 000 floor just saying
 
01:20:01.850 --> 01:20:01.860 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:20:04.189 --> 01:20:04.199 align:start position:0%
Let's uh put this let's let's you know
 
01:20:06.830 --> 01:20:06.840 align:start position:0%
cancel this and figure it out in the
 
01:20:09.890 --> 01:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
future on how this would work
 
01:20:13.250 --> 01:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
my ability is a big conversation now
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
State our schools are getting they have
 
01:20:18.649 --> 01:20:18.659 align:start position:0%
an assessment process in schools that
 
01:20:21.830 --> 01:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
are not achieving to the degree that
 
01:20:24.169 --> 01:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
they should be usually you need to end
 
01:20:27.169 --> 01:20:27.179 align:start position:0%
up doing some kind of a plan to bring
 
01:20:31.010 --> 01:20:31.020 align:start position:0%
the students up so there's already means
 
01:20:32.270 --> 01:20:32.280 align:start position:0%
in place
 
01:20:33.890 --> 01:20:33.900 align:start position:0%
that requires some kind of
 
01:20:36.890 --> 01:20:36.900 align:start position:0%
accountability plan so there are at
 
01:20:39.229 --> 01:20:39.239 align:start position:0%
least two different kind of Pathways for
 
01:20:40.669 --> 01:20:40.679 align:start position:0%
accountability reporting right now
 
01:20:42.770 --> 01:20:42.780 align:start position:0%
around that um so there's the federal
 
01:20:44.750 --> 01:20:44.760 align:start position:0%
every student succeeds act which
 
01:20:47.570 --> 01:20:47.580 align:start position:0%
requires the Department of Education to
 
01:20:50.510 --> 01:20:50.520 align:start position:0%
do a various amount of categorization of
 
01:20:52.010 --> 01:20:52.020 align:start position:0%
schools and look at the bottom five
 
01:20:54.169 --> 01:20:54.179 align:start position:0%
percent of schools those bottom five
 
01:20:55.850 --> 01:20:55.860 align:start position:0%
percent of schools are the comprehensive
 
01:20:57.890 --> 01:20:57.900 align:start position:0%
support and Improvement schools and
 
01:21:00.290 --> 01:21:00.300 align:start position:0%
there is additional funding available
 
01:21:03.229 --> 01:21:03.239 align:start position:0%
sorry the bottom five percent of Title
 
01:21:04.850 --> 01:21:04.860 align:start position:0%
One schools I do need to add that in
 
01:21:06.470 --> 01:21:06.480 align:start position:0%
because it is a caveat if you don't
 
01:21:08.450 --> 01:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
receive Title One funding then you don't
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
get included in this so there could be
 
01:21:11.630 --> 01:21:11.640 align:start position:0%
five there could be schools that don't
 
01:21:13.430 --> 01:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
receive Title One funding they would
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise fall into that category
 
01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:16.970 align:start position:0%
otherwise fall into that category
um

01:21:16.970 --> 01:21:16.980 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:18.709 --> 01:21:18.719 align:start position:0%
so there's additional Federal funding
 
01:21:20.990 --> 01:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
it's a set aside off the top of our 50
 
01:21:23.390 --> 01:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
million dollar 40 million dollar a year
 
01:21:25.250 --> 01:21:25.260 align:start position:0%
Title One Grant
 
01:21:28.669 --> 01:21:28.679 align:start position:0%
um that we give to those schools they
 
01:21:31.070 --> 01:21:31.080 align:start position:0%
also then have A needs assessment that
 
01:21:32.810 --> 01:21:32.820 align:start position:0%
they're required to do they work with
 
01:21:34.850 --> 01:21:34.860 align:start position:0%
various different contractors that the
 
01:21:36.950 --> 01:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
department has in place to improve their
 
01:21:39.530 --> 01:21:39.540 align:start position:0%
assessment scores and whatnot we do
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
those determinations every three years
 
01:21:43.870 --> 01:21:43.880 align:start position:0%
we have we did
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
determinations this past fall and we
 
01:21:48.470 --> 01:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
will be doing determinations again next
 
01:21:50.890 --> 01:21:50.900 align:start position:0%
fall just because of some technical
 
01:21:54.290 --> 01:21:54.300 align:start position:0%
concern not because of basically covet
 
01:21:55.729 --> 01:21:55.739 align:start position:0%
we got kind of messed up with our
 
01:21:55.739 --> 01:21:57.110 align:start position:0%
we got kind of messed up with our
scheduling

01:21:57.110 --> 01:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
scheduling
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
um because we had two years that we
 
01:22:00.410 --> 01:22:00.420 align:start position:0%
didn't really we had assessments but
 
01:22:01.729 --> 01:22:01.739 align:start position:0%
what not
 
01:22:01.739 --> 01:22:02.390 align:start position:0%
what not
um

01:22:02.390 --> 01:22:02.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:22:05.870 --> 01:22:05.880 align:start position:0%
and there's a a lot of metrics and
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
um that are involved in that calculation
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
so we do that through our federal
 
01:22:11.090 --> 01:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
process it's paid for with Federal
 
01:22:14.450 --> 01:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
funding additionally we do have state
 
01:22:16.430 --> 01:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
accountability that is required under
 
01:22:19.090 --> 01:22:19.100 align:start position:0%
RSA 193e and
 
01:22:23.270 --> 01:22:23.280 align:start position:0%
rsa193h those are accountability for an
 
01:22:25.729 --> 01:22:25.739 align:start position:0%
adequate education uh the department of
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
education does have a comprehensive
 
01:22:29.689 --> 01:22:29.699 align:start position:0%
overhaul of those systems right now that
 
01:22:31.070 --> 01:22:31.080 align:start position:0%
we've been working we actually just got
 
01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:32.640 align:start position:0%
passed through Senate education and
 
01:22:34.970 --> 01:22:34.980 align:start position:0%
we'll be coming to hopefully full Senate
 
01:22:34.980 --> 01:22:36.290 align:start position:0%
we'll be coming to hopefully full Senate
shortly

01:22:36.290 --> 01:22:36.300 align:start position:0%
shortly
 
01:22:39.490 --> 01:22:39.500 align:start position:0%
um where we are not redesigning but
 
01:22:43.189 --> 01:22:43.199 align:start position:0%
rewriting the existing law in a way that
 
01:22:45.830 --> 01:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
we can start implementing that work
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
um so representative Heath and Petrie
 
01:22:50.750 --> 01:22:50.760 align:start position:0%
and Murray you maybe remember this but
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
we you did Grant the Department of
 
01:22:54.229 --> 01:22:54.239 align:start position:0%
Education a position to oversee State
 
01:22:56.330 --> 01:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
accountability last year specifically
 
01:22:57.410 --> 01:22:57.420 align:start position:0%
and we're working through those
 
01:22:59.930 --> 01:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
processes right now that Pro those two
 
01:23:02.330 --> 01:23:02.340 align:start position:0%
processes are known as the input-based
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
accountability system and the
 
01:23:05.570 --> 01:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
performance-based accountability system
 
01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:08.520 align:start position:0%
the input-based accountability system is
 
01:23:11.630 --> 01:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
um essentially a survey slash narrative
 
01:23:14.810 --> 01:23:14.820 align:start position:0%
that school districts must do or schools
 
01:23:16.850 --> 01:23:16.860 align:start position:0%
rather must do every
 
01:23:18.890 --> 01:23:18.900 align:start position:0%
um what we're trying to say every three
 
01:23:20.510 --> 01:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
years because the schedule is kind of
 
01:23:21.910 --> 01:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
confusing right now
 
01:23:25.370 --> 01:23:25.380 align:start position:0%
to describe how they are implementing
 
01:23:27.950 --> 01:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
inadequate education so that's the ibas
 
01:23:31.610 --> 01:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
system and people have that name means a
 
01:23:32.930 --> 01:23:32.940 align:start position:0%
lot to an educator they know what the
 
01:23:34.729 --> 01:23:34.739 align:start position:0%
ibass system is
 
01:23:36.830 --> 01:23:36.840 align:start position:0%
and then the pbas performance-based
 
01:23:39.169 --> 01:23:39.179 align:start position:0%
accountability system looks a lot like
 
01:23:41.750 --> 01:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
the Essa program that I just described
 
01:23:43.970 --> 01:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
which is the CSI
 
01:23:45.649 --> 01:23:45.659 align:start position:0%
um this comprehensive support and
 
01:23:47.270 --> 01:23:47.280 align:start position:0%
Improvement schools where we rank
 
01:23:48.770 --> 01:23:48.780 align:start position:0%
schools and we look at the bottom five
 
01:23:51.530 --> 01:23:51.540 align:start position:0%
percent of schools and then there is a
 
01:23:53.570 --> 01:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
reporting structure that is in state law
 
01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
that school districts must do reports
 
01:23:58.010 --> 01:23:58.020 align:start position:0%
for every year that they fail to meet
 
01:24:00.229 --> 01:24:00.239 align:start position:0%
the definition or fail to show that
 
01:24:01.550 --> 01:24:01.560 align:start position:0%
they're providing an adequate education
 
01:24:03.590 --> 01:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
through the definition in state law and
 
01:24:05.450 --> 01:24:05.460 align:start position:0%
those reporting requirements I forget if
 
01:24:09.229 --> 01:24:09.239 align:start position:0%
they're an RSA 193e or rsa193h but it
 
01:24:10.790 --> 01:24:10.800 align:start position:0%
describes some reports that they're
 
01:24:16.189 --> 01:24:16.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:19.189 --> 01:24:19.199 align:start position:0%
I'll go back to my original observation
 
01:24:21.050 --> 01:24:21.060 align:start position:0%
even though I I don't know what title
 
01:24:22.729 --> 01:24:22.739 align:start position:0%
one money is because I'm new to this
 
01:24:25.550 --> 01:24:25.560 align:start position:0%
yeah well let me tell you let me tell
 
01:24:28.250 --> 01:24:28.260 align:start position:0%
you so so Title One money
 
01:24:29.689 --> 01:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
um is money that the department has been
 
01:24:31.610 --> 01:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
receiving basically for the history of
 
01:24:33.590 --> 01:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
forever but it most notably became known
 
01:24:35.630 --> 01:24:35.640 align:start position:0%
as title one under No Child Left Behind
 
01:24:38.689 --> 01:24:38.699 align:start position:0%
in 2001. it's grants that go to every
 
01:24:40.189 --> 01:24:40.199 align:start position:0%
single School District it's a formula
 
01:24:42.050 --> 01:24:42.060 align:start position:0%
allocation Grant I'm sorry every single
 
01:24:44.149 --> 01:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
state the Department of Education in New
 
01:24:45.649 --> 01:24:45.659 align:start position:0%
Hampshire receives about 40 million
 
01:24:47.750 --> 01:24:47.760 align:start position:0%
dollars that we allocate out to schools
 
01:24:49.970 --> 01:24:49.980 align:start position:0%
on the basis of enrollment and free and
 
01:24:53.330 --> 01:24:53.340 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch and their census data
 
01:24:55.310 --> 01:24:55.320 align:start position:0%
um and it's so that's this this formula
 
01:24:57.410 --> 01:24:57.420 align:start position:0%
that's in federal law and then the
 
01:24:59.870 --> 01:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
federal law is fairly prescriptive on
 
01:25:02.209 --> 01:25:02.219 align:start position:0%
what those funds can be spent on
 
01:25:04.070 --> 01:25:04.080 align:start position:0%
um and so that money goes to all of the
 
01:25:06.229 --> 01:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
schools across the state um and they use
 
01:25:06.239 --> 01:25:07.189 align:start position:0%
schools across the state um and they use
that

01:25:07.189 --> 01:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:25:08.510 --> 01:25:08.520 align:start position:0%
um for
 
01:25:11.510 --> 01:25:11.520 align:start position:0%
um for those metrics um so it's a series
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
so when we're talking about
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
education funding and federal education
 
01:25:18.410 --> 01:25:18.420 align:start position:0%
law there's some large Federal Acts that
 
01:25:20.570 --> 01:25:20.580 align:start position:0%
oversee and describe a lot of the work
 
01:25:21.649 --> 01:25:21.659 align:start position:0%
that we do at the Department of
 
01:25:24.169 --> 01:25:24.179 align:start position:0%
Education uh there are four specific
 
01:25:26.510 --> 01:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
ones so there's every student succeeds
 
01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:28.440 align:start position:0%
act which is No Child Left Behind you
 
01:25:32.030 --> 01:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
can equate those the yes yeah yes the
 
01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:33.600 align:start position:0%
original Elementary and secondary
 
01:25:35.330 --> 01:25:35.340 align:start position:0%
Education Act is the original one that
 
01:25:37.970 --> 01:25:37.980 align:start position:0%
was passed in 1965.
 
01:25:41.090 --> 01:25:41.100 align:start position:0%
um it was a LBJ
 
01:25:42.890 --> 01:25:42.900 align:start position:0%
um and then it has been reauthorized
 
01:25:44.810 --> 01:25:44.820 align:start position:0%
over the years over the years for some
 
01:25:46.370 --> 01:25:46.380 align:start position:0%
reason the one that got the most name
 
01:25:49.370 --> 01:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
and notability was No Child Left Behind
 
01:25:51.770 --> 01:25:51.780 align:start position:0%
because that's really when it became
 
01:25:53.630 --> 01:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
looking at accountability and assessment
 
01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:55.860 align:start position:0%
scores and all of that and then so that
 
01:25:58.850 --> 01:25:58.860 align:start position:0%
was most recently authorized in 2015 as
 
01:26:01.430 --> 01:26:01.440 align:start position:0%
every student succeeds act within that
 
01:26:04.450 --> 01:26:04.460 align:start position:0%
there's about
 
01:26:07.430 --> 01:26:07.440 align:start position:0%
80-ish million fed of federal dollars
 
01:26:08.689 --> 01:26:08.699 align:start position:0%
that comes to the Department of
 
01:26:10.729 --> 01:26:10.739 align:start position:0%
Education that we distribute out to
 
01:26:12.470 --> 01:26:12.480 align:start position:0%
school districts and that's when we
 
01:26:14.390 --> 01:26:14.400 align:start position:0%
Title One Is 40 million dollars of that
 
01:26:15.709 --> 01:26:15.719 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
um to support students
 
01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:20.040 align:start position:0%
um that have educated educationally
 
01:26:22.070 --> 01:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged students
 
01:26:26.090 --> 01:26:26.100 align:start position:0%
um and so then we have Title II which is
 
01:26:28.010 --> 01:26:28.020 align:start position:0%
professional development funding that
 
01:26:30.229 --> 01:26:30.239 align:start position:0%
goes to professional development and can
 
01:26:34.010 --> 01:26:34.020 align:start position:0%
reduce class size title III which is for
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
um and sorry title two is about 12
 
01:26:37.310 --> 01:26:37.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars title III which is about
 
01:26:40.850 --> 01:26:40.860 align:start position:0%
a million dollars which goes to support
 
01:26:43.970 --> 01:26:43.980 align:start position:0%
English language Learners title IV which
 
01:26:46.790 --> 01:26:46.800 align:start position:0%
is a technology Grant is a title for b
 
01:26:51.169 --> 01:26:51.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:51.179 --> 01:26:52.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:26:52.490 --> 01:26:52.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:54.709 --> 01:26:54.719 align:start position:0%
um b um which is the technology Grant
 
01:26:55.729 --> 01:26:55.739 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:26:57.890 --> 01:26:57.900 align:start position:0%
see is
 
01:27:00.590 --> 01:27:00.600 align:start position:0%
um before and after school programs and
 
01:27:03.169 --> 01:27:03.179 align:start position:0%
that's about six million dollars so we
 
01:27:04.669 --> 01:27:04.679 align:start position:0%
have money that we receive for federal
 
01:27:07.310 --> 01:27:07.320 align:start position:0%
assessments so that's every the every
 
01:27:08.810 --> 01:27:08.820 align:start position:0%
student succeeds Act
 
01:27:10.790 --> 01:27:10.800 align:start position:0%
then we also have another large 50
 
01:27:12.470 --> 01:27:12.480 align:start position:0%
million dollar a year grant that we
 
01:27:14.090 --> 01:27:14.100 align:start position:0%
receive that we distribute out to school
 
01:27:16.070 --> 01:27:16.080 align:start position:0%
districts called idea it's the
 
01:27:18.590 --> 01:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
individuals with disabilities Education
 
01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
Act that's special education funding
 
01:27:24.050 --> 01:27:24.060 align:start position:0%
um and then we have Carl D Carl D
 
01:27:25.790 --> 01:27:25.800 align:start position:0%
Perkins which is career and Tech
 
01:27:28.129 --> 01:27:28.139 align:start position:0%
education and then we have adult
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
education which I think is just called
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
adult education I don't think it has a
 
01:27:34.370 --> 01:27:34.380 align:start position:0%
fun name but those are some of the large
 
01:27:35.870 --> 01:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
Federal programs that we're implementing
 
01:27:39.110 --> 01:27:39.120 align:start position:0%
at the Department of Education so well
 
01:27:40.910 --> 01:27:40.920 align:start position:0%
yeah but that's not really an education
 
01:27:43.669 --> 01:27:43.679 align:start position:0%
it is they would kill me if I said that
 
01:27:46.910 --> 01:27:46.920 align:start position:0%
yes yes as a freshman I would appreciate
 
01:27:48.830 --> 01:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
a quick summary maybe a quick written
 
01:27:51.110 --> 01:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
summary whenever you have time you know
 
01:27:52.790 --> 01:27:52.800 align:start position:0%
just what you were basically giving
 
01:27:55.129 --> 01:27:55.139 align:start position:0%
verbally but my note-taking cannot quite
 
01:27:56.930 --> 01:27:56.940 align:start position:0%
keep up and uh
 
01:27:58.910 --> 01:27:58.920 align:start position:0%
would it doesn't have to be there and if
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
there is a location you know I can just
 
01:28:02.689 --> 01:28:02.699 align:start position:0%
go if it's on a website just uh you know
 
01:28:06.950 --> 01:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
yeah um I'll see what we can send to you
 
01:28:08.990 --> 01:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
seriously if it's a URL to an existing
 
01:28:10.970 --> 01:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
page I'm happy I don't need a special
 
01:28:10.980 --> 01:28:12.430 align:start position:0%
page I'm happy I don't need a special
thing

01:28:12.430 --> 01:28:12.440 align:start position:0%
thing
 
01:28:14.510 --> 01:28:14.520 align:start position:0%
some of it's on the website but not in
 
01:28:15.830 --> 01:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
kind of in the fashion that I just sent
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
to you so um actually what I'm going to
 
01:28:19.550 --> 01:28:19.560 align:start position:0%
send to you is a page from the federal
 
01:28:21.229 --> 01:28:21.239 align:start position:0%
organmeki is a page from the federal
 
01:28:23.270 --> 01:28:23.280 align:start position:0%
budget that kind of shows some of those
 
01:28:26.110 --> 01:28:26.120 align:start position:0%
yes that's perfect yeah
 
01:28:31.010 --> 01:28:31.020 align:start position:0%
oh thank you uh equalized valuation and
 
01:28:33.590 --> 01:28:33.600 align:start position:0%
free reduce you keep mentioning that
 
01:28:35.629 --> 01:28:35.639 align:start position:0%
do you think equalized valuation will
 
01:28:38.270 --> 01:28:38.280 align:start position:0%
give you a good measure uh and not worry
 
01:28:40.250 --> 01:28:40.260 align:start position:0%
about the pre-reduced or do you need
 
01:28:44.930 --> 01:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:46.010 --> 01:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
you know what I'm saying in other words
 
01:28:48.229 --> 01:28:48.239 align:start position:0%
we're looking for a ratio which you take
 
01:28:50.570 --> 01:28:50.580 align:start position:0%
the ratio like like Farmington let's say
 
01:28:53.149 --> 01:28:53.159 align:start position:0%
take take what your equalized valuation
 
01:28:55.790 --> 01:28:55.800 align:start position:0%
is put it over the state total
 
01:28:58.550 --> 01:28:58.560 align:start position:0%
equalized evaluation all right and use
 
01:29:00.709 --> 01:29:00.719 align:start position:0%
that as a measure in other words at some
 
01:29:02.209 --> 01:29:02.219 align:start position:0%
point you're going to find that you know
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
one's poverty one's once not I mean it's
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
you hate to do hard lines
 
01:29:09.290 --> 01:29:09.300 align:start position:0%
you know because you got a stair step of
 
01:29:10.370 --> 01:29:10.380 align:start position:0%
fat right
 
01:29:14.030 --> 01:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
but is that would the feds and we're
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out matter of fact I'm
 
01:29:19.310 --> 01:29:19.320 align:start position:0%
thinking of 529 in this in this case so
 
01:29:22.129 --> 01:29:22.139 align:start position:0%
and you keep mentioning that that uh
 
01:29:24.110 --> 01:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
this this this ratio that you're talking
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
about between uh and Freeman reduce
 
01:29:30.590 --> 01:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
lunch which the counts is which is not
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
root we're not talking about lunch early
 
01:29:33.770 --> 01:29:33.780 align:start position:0%
but that's I wish we'd get away from
 
01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
that but call it something else but what
 
01:29:38.450 --> 01:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
do you think just the equalized
 
01:29:40.370 --> 01:29:40.380 align:start position:0%
valuation would give us a
 
01:29:43.970 --> 01:29:43.980 align:start position:0%
a good measure a measure a measure for
 
01:29:47.930 --> 01:29:47.940 align:start position:0%
poverty so not necessarily not equalized
 
01:29:50.209 --> 01:29:50.219 align:start position:0%
valuation on its own I think equalized
 
01:29:53.090 --> 01:29:53.100 align:start position:0%
valuation does look at a ability to
 
01:29:54.890 --> 01:29:54.900 align:start position:0%
raise taxes it's a very important
 
01:29:56.629 --> 01:29:56.639 align:start position:0%
measurement especially since the large
 
01:29:59.090 --> 01:29:59.100 align:start position:0%
amount of Education funding is being
 
01:30:02.689 --> 01:30:02.699 align:start position:0%
paid for with property taxes I I believe
 
01:30:05.629 --> 01:30:05.639 align:start position:0%
um so equalized valuation looks at a
 
01:30:09.830 --> 01:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
Local's ability to raise taxes
 
01:30:11.689 --> 01:30:11.699 align:start position:0%
um but if you look at a school district
 
01:30:15.530 --> 01:30:15.540 align:start position:0%
like Bedford or even I'm not sure if
 
01:30:17.149 --> 01:30:17.159 align:start position:0%
you'd happen to know windham's off the
 
01:30:20.090 --> 01:30:20.100 align:start position:0%
top of your mind equalize valuation I'm
 
01:30:21.709 --> 01:30:21.719 align:start position:0%
guessing because there's a large number
 
01:30:23.689 --> 01:30:23.699 align:start position:0%
of kids in Windham you probably have a
 
01:30:25.850 --> 01:30:25.860 align:start position:0%
lower equalized valuation compared to
 
01:30:27.110 --> 01:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
some towns
 
01:30:29.990 --> 01:30:30.000 align:start position:0%
and then you have other towns like a
 
01:30:32.930 --> 01:30:32.940 align:start position:0%
barklett a Lincoln or a Pittsburgh for
 
01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:34.739 align:start position:0%
example that all have a very high
 
01:30:37.490 --> 01:30:37.500 align:start position:0%
equalized valuation per student right
 
01:30:39.050 --> 01:30:39.060 align:start position:0%
but there's not that many students right
 
01:30:40.910 --> 01:30:40.920 align:start position:0%
but but the students that live there
 
01:30:43.070 --> 01:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
typically they do have a higher free and
 
01:30:45.530 --> 01:30:45.540 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch percentage of kids and
 
01:30:47.570 --> 01:30:47.580 align:start position:0%
that's why I think that's the one of the
 
01:30:50.270 --> 01:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
things when Senator Hennessey wrote the
 
01:30:51.950 --> 01:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant she really
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at both of those things
 
01:30:56.270 --> 01:30:56.280 align:start position:0%
together saying like what are the towns
 
01:30:58.490 --> 01:30:58.500 align:start position:0%
that have both a flow equalized
 
01:31:01.010 --> 01:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
valuation and a high percentage of free
 
01:31:03.050 --> 01:31:03.060 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch she was I think fairly
 
01:31:05.330 --> 01:31:05.340 align:start position:0%
thoughtful when she she did that because
 
01:31:05.340 --> 01:31:06.709 align:start position:0%
thoughtful when she she did that because
they

01:31:06.709 --> 01:31:06.719 align:start position:0%
they
 
01:31:09.110 --> 01:31:09.120 align:start position:0%
they do need to be looked at together
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
right well we need to we need to measure
 
01:31:12.950 --> 01:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
a free reduced
 
01:31:15.110 --> 01:31:15.120 align:start position:0%
besides the you know the the forms
 
01:31:17.870 --> 01:31:17.880 align:start position:0%
coming in because it just it's not it's
 
01:31:19.610 --> 01:31:19.620 align:start position:0%
not working and we're we're trying to
 
01:31:27.890 --> 01:31:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:29.990 --> 01:31:30.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:31:32.390 --> 01:31:32.400 align:start position:0%
so the National Standard actually for
 
01:31:34.610 --> 01:31:34.620 align:start position:0%
the most part I think is just using the
 
01:31:36.530 --> 01:31:36.540 align:start position:0%
census data which we have found is
 
01:31:38.870 --> 01:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
mostly inaccurate when it look when you
 
01:31:42.050 --> 01:31:42.060 align:start position:0%
look at New Hampshire and that is one of
 
01:31:43.550 --> 01:31:43.560 align:start position:0%
our challenges and why we have an
 
01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:45.780 align:start position:0%
alternative authorization in title one
 
01:31:48.770 --> 01:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
so many states just use the census data
 
01:31:50.090 --> 01:31:50.100 align:start position:0%
when they're Distributing their Title 1
 
01:31:51.890 --> 01:31:51.900 align:start position:0%
Formula but for example we have
 
01:31:53.629 --> 01:31:53.639 align:start position:0%
alternative authorization and approval
 
01:31:55.129 --> 01:31:55.139 align:start position:0%
from the U.S Department of Education to
 
01:31:57.169 --> 01:31:57.179 align:start position:0%
use a blending of enrollment for
 
01:31:59.870 --> 01:31:59.880 align:start position:0%
introduced lunch and census data which
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
we feel like better gives funding to all
 
01:32:05.810 --> 01:32:05.820 align:start position:0%
of the districts across the state
 
01:32:05.820 --> 01:32:13.129 align:start position:0%
of the districts across the state
so

01:32:13.129 --> 01:32:13.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:15.950 --> 01:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
um so what I just described that's how
 
01:32:18.110 --> 01:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
we distribute the title one funding yes
 
01:32:21.709 --> 01:32:21.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:23.750 --> 01:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
and this is where we're looking at going
 
01:32:25.850 --> 01:32:25.860 align:start position:0%
to Medicaid
 
01:32:29.330 --> 01:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
well so if you use McCade it is just
 
01:32:31.490 --> 01:32:31.500 align:start position:0%
um if you use Medicaid in direct search
 
01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
so I
 
01:32:33.770 --> 01:32:33.780 align:start position:0%
there's I know there's a couple
 
01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:35.280 align:start position:0%
different proposals and I haven't been
 
01:32:37.430 --> 01:32:37.440 align:start position:0%
engaged in every conversation
 
01:32:39.169 --> 01:32:39.179 align:start position:0%
um but if you use
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in direct serve all it is is
 
01:32:44.450 --> 01:32:44.460 align:start position:0%
going to include Medicaid as an
 
01:32:46.370 --> 01:32:46.380 align:start position:0%
eligibility factor for free and reduced
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
lunch but then all the additional free
 
01:32:49.430 --> 01:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
and reduced lunch categories will also
 
01:32:51.590 --> 01:32:51.600 align:start position:0%
be included whereas if you just use
 
01:32:53.510 --> 01:32:53.520 align:start position:0%
Medicaid instead of free and reduced
 
01:32:55.790 --> 01:32:55.800 align:start position:0%
lunch you would only be using Medicaid
 
01:33:00.649 --> 01:33:00.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:00.659 --> 01:33:01.370 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:33:01.370 --> 01:33:01.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:05.209 --> 01:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
okay speaking for myself we do
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
understand that the you know legislation
 
01:33:12.410 --> 01:33:12.420 align:start position:0%
to directly enroll Medicaid kids into
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
launch may or may not pass and even if
 
01:33:16.010 --> 01:33:16.020 align:start position:0%
it passes it will only have an impact
 
01:33:19.010 --> 01:33:19.020 align:start position:0%
here is down the road we were trying to
 
01:33:20.570 --> 01:33:20.580 align:start position:0%
figure out if there is something we can
 
01:33:22.370 --> 01:33:22.380 align:start position:0%
address in this budget cycle to address
 
01:33:24.530 --> 01:33:24.540 align:start position:0%
the concerns about the free and reduced
 
01:33:26.570 --> 01:33:26.580 align:start position:0%
numbers being inaccurate and resulting
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
in underfunding of districts that may
 
01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
need more funds but they just don't have
 
01:33:33.709 --> 01:33:33.719 align:start position:0%
the fnr because you know the launches
 
01:33:35.870 --> 01:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
are free anyway so parents don't fill up
 
01:33:38.030 --> 01:33:38.040 align:start position:0%
the forms so the lunches are not free
 
01:33:40.490 --> 01:33:40.500 align:start position:0%
anyways anymore well yeah but for a long
 
01:33:42.830 --> 01:33:42.840 align:start position:0%
time they have been and there is a lot
 
01:33:45.050 --> 01:33:45.060 align:start position:0%
of inertia and people who haven't filed
 
01:33:47.330 --> 01:33:47.340 align:start position:0%
for a few years may just not bother and
 
01:33:48.890 --> 01:33:48.900 align:start position:0%
that's what I have actually I was at a
 
01:33:50.330 --> 01:33:50.340 align:start position:0%
superintendent's meeting yesterday in
 
01:33:52.070 --> 01:33:52.080 align:start position:0%
Berlin and I heard specifically that
 
01:33:53.510 --> 01:33:53.520 align:start position:0%
that now they can't collect the forms
 
01:33:56.450 --> 01:33:56.460 align:start position:0%
and now the the lunch deaths so yeah so
 
01:33:58.669 --> 01:33:58.679 align:start position:0%
and because of that there is a concern
 
01:34:00.709 --> 01:34:00.719 align:start position:0%
among more you know not just me but
 
01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:02.880 align:start position:0%
other people here are also concerned
 
01:34:04.850 --> 01:34:04.860 align:start position:0%
that that data is just not very accurate
 
01:34:07.070 --> 01:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
and it under counts and again it leads
 
01:34:08.990 --> 01:34:09.000 align:start position:0%
to improper allocation of a that doesn't
 
01:34:11.330 --> 01:34:11.340 align:start position:0%
go to where it's really needed so one of
 
01:34:12.890 --> 01:34:12.900 align:start position:0%
the things that we were looking at as a
 
01:34:15.169 --> 01:34:15.179 align:start position:0%
possibility was to see if we can just
 
01:34:17.209 --> 01:34:17.219 align:start position:0%
take the you know percentage of the
 
01:34:19.250 --> 01:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
residents that are on Medicaid as a
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
proxy for poverty the way free and clear
 
01:34:23.149 --> 01:34:23.159 align:start position:0%
was supposed to do and we are talking
 
01:34:25.430 --> 01:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
about you know the left side of the
 
01:34:27.709 --> 01:34:27.719 align:start position:0%
formula right where we just use the free
 
01:34:31.129 --> 01:34:31.139 align:start position:0%
and reduced and whether changing the
 
01:34:32.990 --> 01:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
measure that we use to allocate those
 
01:34:35.629 --> 01:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
funds would lead to a more Equitable you
 
01:34:38.030 --> 01:34:38.040 align:start position:0%
know allocation and it's a complex
 
01:34:39.830 --> 01:34:39.840 align:start position:0%
discussion but I just you know while
 
01:34:42.470 --> 01:34:42.480 align:start position:0%
you're here obviously we don't have the
 
01:34:43.790 --> 01:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
numbers right now it's actually
 
01:34:46.310 --> 01:34:46.320 align:start position:0%
something that we are looking to kind of
 
01:34:48.169 --> 01:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
look how the changes would go but what
 
01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:50.280 align:start position:0%
would your thoughts be on that topic so
 
01:34:52.010 --> 01:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
I mean I think there are a lot of
 
01:34:54.110 --> 01:34:54.120 align:start position:0%
unknowns and I think without having a
 
01:34:56.030 --> 01:34:56.040 align:start position:0%
apples to Apple comparison it's very
 
01:34:58.370 --> 01:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
hard for the Department to speak on it
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
um because we just don't know exactly
 
01:35:01.970 --> 01:35:01.980 align:start position:0%
how many of those kids that are coming
 
01:35:03.770 --> 01:35:03.780 align:start position:0%
over as Medicaid eligible are actually
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
in schools and whatnot the other thing
 
01:35:07.669 --> 01:35:07.679 align:start position:0%
too I do just want to bring to the
 
01:35:09.290 --> 01:35:09.300 align:start position:0%
committee's attention is it doesn't
 
01:35:12.590 --> 01:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily solve all of the problems so
 
01:35:15.290 --> 01:35:15.300 align:start position:0%
you are talking about making this change
 
01:35:17.390 --> 01:35:17.400 align:start position:0%
for the purpose of adequacy which you
 
01:35:18.590 --> 01:35:18.600 align:start position:0%
know it's a billion dollars it's the
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
biggest line item in the state budget is
 
01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
what matters most and we have the you
 
01:35:24.950 --> 01:35:24.960 align:start position:0%
know where you guys are making the
 
01:35:26.689 --> 01:35:26.699 align:start position:0%
decisions on that
 
01:35:30.770 --> 01:35:30.780 align:start position:0%
um so that is an important factor to get
 
01:35:34.070 --> 01:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
right in the adequacy formula however
 
01:35:35.629 --> 01:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
free and reduced lunch is still a
 
01:35:37.070 --> 01:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
requirement in title one and I don't
 
01:35:39.050 --> 01:35:39.060 align:start position:0%
know that we could use Medicaid we would
 
01:35:40.550 --> 01:35:40.560 align:start position:0%
have to apply to the US Department of
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
Education same with some of the other
 
01:35:43.729 --> 01:35:43.739 align:start position:0%
grants I understood I was just talking
 
01:35:46.070 --> 01:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
about our portion of States so I think I
 
01:35:48.050 --> 01:35:48.060 align:start position:0%
am we understand that you know that is a
 
01:35:49.910 --> 01:35:49.920 align:start position:0%
number used by a lot of federal staff it
 
01:35:51.770 --> 01:35:51.780 align:start position:0%
is what it is but we cannot fix that
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I think there's just a lot
 
01:35:55.010 --> 01:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
of implications that are outside of the
 
01:35:59.990 --> 01:36:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:02.450 --> 01:36:02.460 align:start position:0%
they were to adopt the use of
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
direct certification because it would be
 
01:36:08.930 --> 01:36:08.940 align:start position:0%
direct it would be to a kid that would
 
01:36:10.910 --> 01:36:10.920 align:start position:0%
be okay and we could use those
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
percentages for fnr in the title one and
 
01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:17.040 align:start position:0%
they would go into the FNS for if you do
 
01:36:18.709 --> 01:36:18.719 align:start position:0%
direct certification it will go right
 
01:36:22.010 --> 01:36:22.020 align:start position:0%
into Title One good yes and also the fnr
 
01:36:25.010 --> 01:36:25.020 align:start position:0%
numbers will you know increase
 
01:36:28.129 --> 01:36:28.139 align:start position:0%
so it would kind of if Medicaid
 
01:36:29.810 --> 01:36:29.820 align:start position:0%
certificate direct certification would
 
01:36:31.550 --> 01:36:31.560 align:start position:0%
be a thing probably we would be much
 
01:36:34.010 --> 01:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
less concerned about the poor quality of
 
01:36:35.870 --> 01:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
the current fnr numbers in terms of
 
01:36:38.930 --> 01:36:38.940 align:start position:0%
being a proxy for you know economically
 
01:36:41.930 --> 01:36:41.940 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged students
 
01:36:43.850 --> 01:36:43.860 align:start position:0%
no no it's not for this cycle that's why
 
01:36:46.189 --> 01:36:46.199 align:start position:0%
we're talking you know disregarding that
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
because the timing you know well let's
 
01:36:49.970 --> 01:36:49.980 align:start position:0%
go back to the line item you were
 
01:36:53.330 --> 01:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
looking at right
 
01:36:57.649 --> 01:36:57.659 align:start position:0%
no my my thought right now is
 
01:36:59.930 --> 01:36:59.940 align:start position:0%
we're rewarding people for turning in
 
01:37:01.910 --> 01:37:01.920 align:start position:0%
and Reporting nobody looks at
 
01:37:05.689 --> 01:37:05.699 align:start position:0%
that it has a Parallel Group
 
01:37:07.729 --> 01:37:07.739 align:start position:0%
background in other reports that are
 
01:37:09.350 --> 01:37:09.360 align:start position:0%
already being done
 
01:37:13.669 --> 01:37:13.679 align:start position:0%
so for for my money I would suspend this
 
01:37:16.010 --> 01:37:16.020 align:start position:0%
for this spend the next biennium and
 
01:37:17.450 --> 01:37:17.460 align:start position:0%
figure out you need to do it because
 
01:37:19.129 --> 01:37:19.139 align:start position:0%
right now it sounds like it's a lot of
 
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
work I don't know what happens to the
 
01:37:22.729 --> 01:37:22.739 align:start position:0%
money does have this have a budget line
 
01:37:25.250 --> 01:37:25.260 align:start position:0%
so you just remove the reporting part
 
01:37:29.149 --> 01:37:29.159 align:start position:0%
this is Mickey please Mickey so so yeah
 
01:37:31.430 --> 01:37:31.440 align:start position:0%
uh as part of your proposal for House
 
01:37:33.770 --> 01:37:33.780 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 and Ed funding whatever you do
 
01:37:35.470 --> 01:37:35.480 align:start position:0%
with the extraordinary needs Grant the
 
01:37:37.970 --> 01:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
uh reporting the accountability
 
01:37:40.430 --> 01:37:40.440 align:start position:0%
accountability plans are in here so if
 
01:37:42.890 --> 01:37:42.900 align:start position:0%
you want to repeal it you can do that or
 
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
if you just mentioned suspend it for two
 
01:37:46.729 --> 01:37:46.739 align:start position:0%
years you could do that too whatever I
 
01:37:50.149 --> 01:37:50.159 align:start position:0%
it obviously Senator Hennessy put a lot
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
of thought into it and it made some
 
01:37:55.550 --> 01:37:55.560 align:start position:0%
sense I I think for for yeah this was I
 
01:37:57.229 --> 01:37:57.239 align:start position:0%
think a house position in Community
 
01:37:59.390 --> 01:37:59.400 align:start position:0%
Conference yes this did not was not
 
01:38:01.129 --> 01:38:01.139 align:start position:0%
included in the Senate password Senator
 
01:38:01.139 --> 01:38:02.229 align:start position:0%
included in the Senate password Senator
Hennessey

01:38:02.229 --> 01:38:02.239 align:start position:0%
Hennessey
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
invented whatever the appropriate term
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
is the grants themselves did not have
 
01:38:09.050 --> 01:38:09.060 align:start position:0%
accountability plans tied to the grants
 
01:38:10.490 --> 01:38:10.500 align:start position:0%
she just thought that the grant itself
 
01:38:12.410 --> 01:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
was important I got it married up here
 
01:38:15.290 --> 01:38:15.300 align:start position:0%
well no they they get married up when
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
the bill itself passed
 
01:38:18.950 --> 01:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
um so when I think it was in the
 
01:38:21.410 --> 01:38:21.420 align:start position:0%
committee of conference the house then
 
01:38:23.450 --> 01:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
put accountability they said well if if
 
01:38:24.950 --> 01:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
the Senate wants to Grants then we want
 
01:38:27.290 --> 01:38:27.300 align:start position:0%
accountability plans and so that's how
 
01:38:28.729 --> 01:38:28.739 align:start position:0%
they got married
 
01:38:30.770 --> 01:38:30.780 align:start position:0%
um but the original Senate proposal from
 
01:38:33.410 --> 01:38:33.420 align:start position:0%
Senator Hennessey said we I want to
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
Target additional funding to
 
01:38:38.810 --> 01:38:38.820 align:start position:0%
uh communities that have a high free and
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch and a low equalized
 
01:38:42.229 --> 01:38:42.239 align:start position:0%
valuation and that's all the Senate
 
01:38:44.990 --> 01:38:45.000 align:start position:0%
proposals did I agree with her
 
01:38:47.090 --> 01:38:47.100 align:start position:0%
and so so I would
 
01:38:49.610 --> 01:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
I only we don't need it
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
as far as I'm concerned I just yeah I
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
don't do we eliminate it or would you do
 
01:38:57.290 --> 01:38:57.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:59.450 --> 01:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
what's anybody's thought
 
01:39:04.990 --> 01:39:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.209 --> 01:39:10.219 align:start position:0%
yes that's I love that that's great
 
01:39:13.850 --> 01:39:13.860 align:start position:0%
to you yeah right she says it better
 
01:39:17.510 --> 01:39:17.520 align:start position:0%
than me so we're all in agreement
 
01:39:17.520 --> 01:39:18.790 align:start position:0%
than me so we're all in agreement
I

01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
I
 
01:39:22.250 --> 01:39:22.260 align:start position:0%
would suggest that if anything repealing
 
01:39:24.950 --> 01:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
it would send a clear signal that if
 
01:39:26.689 --> 01:39:26.699 align:start position:0%
anybody feels that this should be in
 
01:39:28.850 --> 01:39:28.860 align:start position:0%
place they can introduce legislation in
 
01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
the you know Next Period and have a
 
01:39:34.850 --> 01:39:34.860 align:start position:0%
better plan or fix it but if we suspend
 
01:39:36.950 --> 01:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
it we are creating uncertainty because
 
01:39:38.810 --> 01:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
now it's supposed to come back in two
 
01:39:40.910 --> 01:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
years and nobody will know whether it's
 
01:39:42.410 --> 01:39:42.420 align:start position:0%
really coming back or it's going to be
 
01:39:45.110 --> 01:39:45.120 align:start position:0%
suspended again to me repealing it is a
 
01:39:47.030 --> 01:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
clear we don't think this should be here
 
01:39:49.490 --> 01:39:49.500 align:start position:0%
if anybody feels differently you have
 
01:39:51.350 --> 01:39:51.360 align:start position:0%
plenty of time to pass one through the
 
01:39:53.450 --> 01:39:53.460 align:start position:0%
house and address whatever we may have
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
undone but sounds like a motion to me
 
01:39:57.950 --> 01:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
well emotion it is
 
01:40:00.470 --> 01:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
right I just need to make note of my own
 
01:40:04.370 --> 01:40:04.380 align:start position:0%
motion so what I'll do uh because this
 
01:40:06.950 --> 01:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
is part of a bigger component of the
 
01:40:08.330 --> 01:40:08.340 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs grant that we
 
01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:09.480 align:start position:0%
haven't settled how we're funding
 
01:40:12.290 --> 01:40:12.300 align:start position:0%
education yet so I'll keep this as the
 
01:40:14.270 --> 01:40:14.280 align:start position:0%
Committees when we do draft an amendment
 
01:40:15.709 --> 01:40:15.719 align:start position:0%
at some point to remove the
 
01:40:18.110 --> 01:40:18.120 align:start position:0%
accountability plans from this okay at
 
01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
the same time we'll remove this position
 
01:40:22.970 --> 01:40:22.980 align:start position:0%
request from our working document here
 
01:40:24.350 --> 01:40:24.360 align:start position:0%
since it wouldn't be needed if you're
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
going to repeal the accountability plans
 
01:40:28.070 --> 01:40:28.080 align:start position:0%
and then jumping to our retained bills
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 638 likely the same thing
 
01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
I'll bump that off here since I think I
 
01:40:34.310 --> 01:40:34.320 align:start position:0%
have a sense of where the committee
 
01:40:35.689 --> 01:40:35.699 align:start position:0%
wants to go with an amendment relative
 
01:40:37.970 --> 01:40:37.980 align:start position:0%
to these yeah just yeah I guess as a
 
01:40:40.250 --> 01:40:40.260 align:start position:0%
follow-ups is when this came I guess you
 
01:40:41.930 --> 01:40:41.940 align:start position:0%
know last biennium
 
01:40:44.510 --> 01:40:44.520 align:start position:0%
um we did not want the plans anyway as I
 
01:40:46.189 --> 01:40:46.199 align:start position:0%
recall it was not part of the procedure
 
01:40:47.750 --> 01:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
it came out in the committee of
 
01:40:50.810 --> 01:40:50.820 align:start position:0%
conference and it was not part of our
 
01:40:56.169 --> 01:40:56.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:59.450 --> 01:40:59.460 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to master that one I think
 
01:41:00.590 --> 01:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
the department staff that have been
 
01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
managing all sorts of fun other words
 
01:41:09.910 --> 01:41:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:11.510 --> 01:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
he gives you another one really really
 
01:41:18.430 --> 01:41:18.440 align:start position:0%
important for another watch
 
01:41:20.510 --> 01:41:20.520 align:start position:0%
and I should I should mention the
 
01:41:22.129 --> 01:41:22.139 align:start position:0%
department is very committed to working
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
on the state assessment and
 
01:41:25.729 --> 01:41:25.739 align:start position:0%
accountability portions of and and so
 
01:41:28.189 --> 01:41:28.199 align:start position:0%
when it won't make it to this committee
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
because it's uh it does not have a
 
01:41:31.070 --> 01:41:31.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal note and it does not need a
 
01:41:32.810 --> 01:41:32.820 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but when the house votes on
 
01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:33.530 align:start position:0%
fiscal note but when the house votes on
that

01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:41:36.470 --> 01:41:36.480 align:start position:0%
um it's Senate Bill 266 the department
 
01:41:38.810 --> 01:41:38.820 align:start position:0%
is going to begin implementing ibas and
 
01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
pbas and we are going to start really
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
working on state state accountability
 
01:41:48.410 --> 01:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:51.770 --> 01:41:51.780 align:start position:0%
yeah well I guess it's been a good
 
01:41:52.970 --> 01:41:52.980 align:start position:0%
morning for you
 
01:41:56.990 --> 01:41:57.000 align:start position:0%
yeah to go back and say guess what well
 
01:41:59.990 --> 01:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
it's not a final until it's fun but as
 
01:42:01.609 --> 01:42:01.619 align:start position:0%
of right now yes this is a good decision
 
01:42:03.709 --> 01:42:03.719 align:start position:0%
for the Department yes we agree is there
 
01:42:05.870 --> 01:42:05.880 align:start position:0%
another topic you'd like to discuss
 
01:42:08.750 --> 01:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
um so there are
 
01:42:11.689 --> 01:42:11.699 align:start position:0%
um some other kind of
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
positions that we had asked for for
 
01:42:16.250 --> 01:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
funding I can explain them
 
01:42:18.229 --> 01:42:18.239 align:start position:0%
um there's some positions but those
 
01:42:19.790 --> 01:42:19.800 align:start position:0%
might be better left for next week
 
01:42:21.530 --> 01:42:21.540 align:start position:0%
potentially when our CFO is going to be
 
01:42:23.209 --> 01:42:23.219 align:start position:0%
here or I can talk I mean I don't know
 
01:42:26.510 --> 01:42:26.520 align:start position:0%
if I can explain it but do you have a
 
01:42:26.520 --> 01:42:29.470 align:start position:0%
if I can explain it but do you have a
preference

01:42:29.470 --> 01:42:29.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:32.570 --> 01:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
I think you could really quickly Caitlyn
 
01:42:34.250 --> 01:42:34.260 align:start position:0%
probably distinguish the difference
 
01:42:36.530 --> 01:42:36.540 align:start position:0%
between what we see on row 44 and then
 
01:42:39.470 --> 01:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
45 46 and 47 are a separate thing I
 
01:42:40.669 --> 01:42:40.679 align:start position:0%
think just just so the committee
 
01:42:42.169 --> 01:42:42.179 align:start position:0%
understands what those are and then you
 
01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
can dive into the details with the
 
01:42:48.649 --> 01:42:48.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:53.209 --> 01:42:53.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:56.750 --> 01:42:56.760 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm on the the money document
 
01:42:58.729 --> 01:42:58.739 align:start position:0%
right now the the funding document
 
01:42:58.739 --> 01:43:00.290 align:start position:0%
right now the the funding document
requests

01:43:00.290 --> 01:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
requests
 
01:43:02.629 --> 01:43:02.639 align:start position:0%
so online uh
 
01:43:06.890 --> 01:43:06.900 align:start position:0%
44 through 47 are some changes to what's
 
01:43:09.229 --> 01:43:09.239 align:start position:0%
budgeted for full and part-time
 
01:43:10.970 --> 01:43:10.980 align:start position:0%
Personnel in the department so I'll let
 
01:43:12.950 --> 01:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
Caitlyn explain those
 
01:43:15.890 --> 01:43:15.900 align:start position:0%
so um you all might be unaware of the
 
01:43:17.810 --> 01:43:17.820 align:start position:0%
technical aspects of the preparation of
 
01:43:19.609 --> 01:43:19.619 align:start position:0%
the state budget but it is very
 
01:43:19.619 --> 01:43:21.169 align:start position:0%
the state budget but it is very
comprehensive

01:43:21.169 --> 01:43:21.179 align:start position:0%
comprehensive
 
01:43:24.290 --> 01:43:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and so each position is budgeted down
 
01:43:26.930 --> 01:43:26.940 align:start position:0%
to the exact dollar amount of what this
 
01:43:29.750 --> 01:43:29.760 align:start position:0%
state anticipates spending for an
 
01:43:33.410 --> 01:43:33.420 align:start position:0%
employee so when I mentioned I was
 
01:43:35.450 --> 01:43:35.460 align:start position:0%
working on seven D's in last March
 
01:43:38.090 --> 01:43:38.100 align:start position:0%
administrative services at that point
 
01:43:40.609 --> 01:43:40.619 align:start position:0%
Was preparing a document called the 7ax
 
01:43:43.609 --> 01:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
and that is what goes to
 
01:43:45.290 --> 01:43:45.300 align:start position:0%
um into your you know thousand page
 
01:43:46.729 --> 01:43:46.739 align:start position:0%
budget document and every time you're
 
01:43:49.129 --> 01:43:49.139 align:start position:0%
seeing a class 10 or a class 60 line
 
01:43:51.350 --> 01:43:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's what that calculation is coming
 
01:43:53.390 --> 01:43:53.400 align:start position:0%
from administrative services and their
 
01:43:55.490 --> 01:43:55.500 align:start position:0%
comprehensive report
 
01:43:57.290 --> 01:43:57.300 align:start position:0%
um and so
 
01:44:00.050 --> 01:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
um if there are positions that are
 
01:44:02.149 --> 01:44:02.159 align:start position:0%
incorrect or have been changed and what
 
01:44:04.669 --> 01:44:04.679 align:start position:0%
not since that time period you end up
 
01:44:07.490 --> 01:44:07.500 align:start position:0%
with kind of some disconnects so the
 
01:44:09.530 --> 01:44:09.540 align:start position:0%
department had a few positions that were
 
01:44:12.709 --> 01:44:12.719 align:start position:0%
Corrections that were identified after a
 
01:44:15.669 --> 01:44:15.679 align:start position:0%
later a review that were not
 
01:44:18.709 --> 01:44:18.719 align:start position:0%
characterized at the right level so we
 
01:44:20.510 --> 01:44:20.520 align:start position:0%
had asked for some additional funding
 
01:44:22.370 --> 01:44:22.380 align:start position:0%
just to make sure we had enough funding
 
01:44:25.430 --> 01:44:25.440 align:start position:0%
for our existing positions for example I
 
01:44:28.490 --> 01:44:28.500 align:start position:0%
had a position that was on the 7ax as a
 
01:44:31.370 --> 01:44:31.380 align:start position:0%
labor grade 19 but the position is
 
01:44:33.609 --> 01:44:33.619 align:start position:0%
actually a labor grade 25
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
so we had to make that correction so
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
those Corrections that you're seeing
 
01:44:41.629 --> 01:44:41.639 align:start position:0%
there in 44 are just Corrections that we
 
01:44:43.070 --> 01:44:43.080 align:start position:0%
have gone through throughout the entire
 
01:44:44.390 --> 01:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
department related to different
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
different positions that were not at the
 
01:44:50.570 --> 01:44:50.580 align:start position:0%
correct labor grades and whatnot
 
01:44:50.580 --> 01:44:54.470 align:start position:0%
correct labor grades and whatnot
so

01:44:54.470 --> 01:44:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:57.550 --> 01:44:57.560 align:start position:0%
it's a it's a general fund increase uh
 
01:45:01.070 --> 01:45:01.080 align:start position:0%
it's and we could you could do it to to
 
01:45:03.649 --> 01:45:03.659 align:start position:0%
fill those positions at the
 
01:45:06.590 --> 01:45:06.600 align:start position:0%
um I think those are yeah I think those
 
01:45:10.430 --> 01:45:10.440 align:start position:0%
are probably more of a yeah it's a 375
 
01:45:12.649 --> 01:45:12.659 align:start position:0%
000 general fund yeah well that was just
 
01:45:14.530 --> 01:45:14.540 align:start position:0%
44 that was just the correction oh yeah
 
01:45:17.510 --> 01:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
total yes yeah so so those I think we
 
01:45:19.129 --> 01:45:19.139 align:start position:0%
the department would classify those as
 
01:45:21.050 --> 01:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
Corrections of existing positions just
 
01:45:23.030 --> 01:45:23.040 align:start position:0%
funded in this budget at the wrong labor
 
01:45:25.729 --> 01:45:25.739 align:start position:0%
grade that that they really are at in
 
01:45:28.609 --> 01:45:28.619 align:start position:0%
reality correct the next set and Caitlyn
 
01:45:30.470 --> 01:45:30.480 align:start position:0%
can can carry this on I think these are
 
01:45:33.649 --> 01:45:33.659 align:start position:0%
not quite technical corrections but so
 
01:45:36.050 --> 01:45:36.060 align:start position:0%
the next set are not technical
 
01:45:38.090 --> 01:45:38.100 align:start position:0%
Corrections because the majority of
 
01:45:41.330 --> 01:45:41.340 align:start position:0%
these positions were vacant at the time
 
01:45:43.609 --> 01:45:43.619 align:start position:0%
of the 7ax being prepared and they've
 
01:45:46.490 --> 01:45:46.500 align:start position:0%
now since been filled at a certain labor
 
01:45:48.109 --> 01:45:48.119 align:start position:0%
grade so the way that the state rules
 
01:45:50.390 --> 01:45:50.400 align:start position:0%
work is is so when administrative
 
01:45:50.400 --> 01:45:51.430 align:start position:0%
work is is so when administrative
services

01:45:51.430 --> 01:45:51.440 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:45:54.229 --> 01:45:54.239 align:start position:0%
does that document if a physician's
 
01:45:55.850 --> 01:45:55.860 align:start position:0%
vacant they budget it at the lowest
 
01:45:57.109 --> 01:45:57.119 align:start position:0%
level so this
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about state employees
 
01:46:01.189 --> 01:46:01.199 align:start position:0%
classified employees which is the
 
01:46:03.890 --> 01:46:03.900 align:start position:0%
majority of state employees there's a
 
01:46:07.010 --> 01:46:07.020 align:start position:0%
class system 1 through 35 and then
 
01:46:10.609 --> 01:46:10.619 align:start position:0%
within that 1 through 35 there are steps
 
01:46:13.850 --> 01:46:13.860 align:start position:0%
one through nine and so you get hired
 
01:46:15.050 --> 01:46:15.060 align:start position:0%
and they'll say all right an
 
01:46:17.990 --> 01:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
administrator is a labor grade 27 and
 
01:46:19.910 --> 01:46:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's the appropriate claim so an
 
01:46:21.830 --> 01:46:21.840 align:start position:0%
administrator at Department of Education
 
01:46:23.750 --> 01:46:23.760 align:start position:0%
is the same as administrator at
 
01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:25.139 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation which is
 
01:46:26.870 --> 01:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
the same as administrative HHS that's
 
01:46:29.990 --> 01:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
the whole state classification system
 
01:46:32.689 --> 01:46:32.699 align:start position:0%
um and then the steps are you move
 
01:46:34.609 --> 01:46:34.619 align:start position:0%
across the steps over your period of
 
01:46:36.050 --> 01:46:36.060 align:start position:0%
time that you're employed so you start
 
01:46:37.850 --> 01:46:37.860 align:start position:0%
on a step one and then you get a step
 
01:46:40.729 --> 01:46:40.739 align:start position:0%
two in year two and then you get up to a
 
01:46:42.050 --> 01:46:42.060 align:start position:0%
certain level and then you have two
 
01:46:43.850 --> 01:46:43.860 align:start position:0%
years before step and then three years
 
01:46:46.129 --> 01:46:46.139 align:start position:0%
before a step over over the life of an
 
01:46:46.139 --> 01:46:47.810 align:start position:0%
before a step over over the life of an
employee

01:46:47.810 --> 01:46:47.820 align:start position:0%
employee
 
01:46:51.830 --> 01:46:51.840 align:start position:0%
um so the additions are
 
01:46:55.430 --> 01:46:55.440 align:start position:0%
um so the way it works is is some when
 
01:46:56.870 --> 01:46:56.880 align:start position:0%
the administrative Services prepares a
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
report they do
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
the lowest step for that employee which
 
01:47:02.810 --> 01:47:02.820 align:start position:0%
obviously makes sense
 
01:47:05.390 --> 01:47:05.400 align:start position:0%
um and then they do the basic benefits
 
01:47:07.250 --> 01:47:07.260 align:start position:0%
package for that employee assuming we
 
01:47:08.990 --> 01:47:09.000 align:start position:0%
come in and then when you go through the
 
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
employment process especially given the
 
01:47:12.770 --> 01:47:12.780 align:start position:0%
state salaries and whatnot right now a
 
01:47:14.330 --> 01:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
lot of times we're negotiating with
 
01:47:16.669 --> 01:47:16.679 align:start position:0%
employees and we end up hiring somebody
 
01:47:20.930 --> 01:47:20.940 align:start position:0%
at not a step one so for example I have
 
01:47:23.270 --> 01:47:23.280 align:start position:0%
an administrator that I have hired or he
 
01:47:25.310 --> 01:47:25.320 align:start position:0%
hasn't accepted the job yet um but this
 
01:47:27.470 --> 01:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
week and he is an internal state
 
01:47:31.790 --> 01:47:31.800 align:start position:0%
employee he's a labor grade 27 right now
 
01:47:33.709 --> 01:47:33.719 align:start position:0%
um actually so he's a labor grade 25
 
01:47:35.450 --> 01:47:35.460 align:start position:0%
right now the position I'm offering him
 
01:47:40.850 --> 01:47:40.860 align:start position:0%
is a labor grade 27. he's a 27 step five
 
01:47:44.270 --> 01:47:44.280 align:start position:0%
my 27 step one which is on this report
 
01:47:46.550 --> 01:47:46.560 align:start position:0%
right here is budgeted at say let's say
 
01:47:49.010 --> 01:47:49.020 align:start position:0%
fifty thousand dollars I'm going to he's
 
01:47:52.010 --> 01:47:52.020 align:start position:0%
going to come in at a labor grade 27.
 
01:47:54.490 --> 01:47:54.500 align:start position:0%
step three it was a lower labor grade
 
01:47:56.870 --> 01:47:56.880 align:start position:0%
for him
 
01:47:59.030 --> 01:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
um but it's the comparable for his
 
01:48:00.649 --> 01:48:00.659 align:start position:0%
current pay so he's not even really
 
01:48:02.330 --> 01:48:02.340 align:start position:0%
making getting a raise or anything like
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
that I mean he's going to be able to
 
01:48:05.390 --> 01:48:05.400 align:start position:0%
make more over the long-term life of an
 
01:48:07.430 --> 01:48:07.440 align:start position:0%
estate employee but the state rule says
 
01:48:08.990 --> 01:48:09.000 align:start position:0%
basically just bring them at the same
 
01:48:13.310 --> 01:48:13.320 align:start position:0%
level so now I have on my 7ax and
 
01:48:15.830 --> 01:48:15.840 align:start position:0%
actually I said you know three and five
 
01:48:17.330 --> 01:48:17.340 align:start position:0%
but it's actually a nine and seven so I
 
01:48:20.090 --> 01:48:20.100 align:start position:0%
have about a thirty five thousand dollar
 
01:48:22.010 --> 01:48:22.020 align:start position:0%
difference from where I'm bringing that
 
01:48:23.629 --> 01:48:23.639 align:start position:0%
person in versus where they're budgeted
 
01:48:25.970 --> 01:48:25.980 align:start position:0%
additionally he happens to have a family
 
01:48:28.970 --> 01:48:28.980 align:start position:0%
and so now I have um he was budgeted at
 
01:48:30.229 --> 01:48:30.239 align:start position:0%
twenty thousand dollars for his family
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
plan and now it's like the fifty
 
01:48:34.370 --> 01:48:34.380 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars or whatever for for the
 
01:48:36.229 --> 01:48:36.239 align:start position:0%
family plan for all the costs of all of
 
01:48:38.570 --> 01:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
the benefits and everything like that
 
01:48:42.109 --> 01:48:42.119 align:start position:0%
um so the five six and seven
 
01:48:44.510 --> 01:48:44.520 align:start position:0%
are kind of cumulative hiring decisions
 
01:48:46.910 --> 01:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
that the department has made for hiring
 
01:48:49.370 --> 01:48:49.380 align:start position:0%
people at higher levels um relative to
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
their steps so that's how you kind of
 
01:48:52.550 --> 01:48:52.560 align:start position:0%
end up with that so
 
01:48:55.010 --> 01:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
um at that time we had and this is
 
01:48:57.050 --> 01:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
probably you're seeing while it seems
 
01:48:58.490 --> 01:48:58.500 align:start position:0%
like a lot of money 800 and something
 
01:48:59.990 --> 01:49:00.000 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars over the course of
 
01:49:02.629 --> 01:49:02.639 align:start position:0%
biennium that's probably 10 ish maybe
 
01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
15-ish employees across the department
 
01:49:07.129 --> 01:49:07.139 align:start position:0%
that is probably equating to different
 
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
steps and or family plans and whatnot
 
01:49:13.729 --> 01:49:13.739 align:start position:0%
across several years so
 
01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:16.260 align:start position:0%
right uh how many how many positions
 
01:49:18.290 --> 01:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
have you not been able to fill and how
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
long I know other other uh departments
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
have you know like they're 20 percent uh
 
01:49:27.470 --> 01:49:27.480 align:start position:0%
not filled and that's that's a big lapse
 
01:49:29.330 --> 01:49:29.340 align:start position:0%
um I I don't know that information for
 
01:49:31.070 --> 01:49:31.080 align:start position:0%
the Department for the Department as a
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
whole I can um find that out I have a
 
01:49:35.750 --> 01:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
zero percent vacancy rate in my division
 
01:49:37.189 --> 01:49:37.199 align:start position:0%
though so
 
01:49:39.410 --> 01:49:39.420 align:start position:0%
I like to brag about that but I'll find
 
01:49:41.750 --> 01:49:41.760 align:start position:0%
that as a whole
 
01:49:43.910 --> 01:49:43.920 align:start position:0%
so I do have a call into the department
 
01:49:46.310 --> 01:49:46.320 align:start position:0%
to hopefully have them join us Monday at
 
01:49:48.770 --> 01:49:48.780 align:start position:0%
10. okay to go through so a lot of these
 
01:49:50.330 --> 01:49:50.340 align:start position:0%
things we can have uh hopefully the
 
01:49:51.950 --> 01:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner will join us and their CFO
 
01:49:53.990 --> 01:49:54.000 align:start position:0%
to get into the details of of these
 
01:49:57.470 --> 01:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
requests I mean I think you heard um so
 
01:49:58.910 --> 01:49:58.920 align:start position:0%
last week and I remember
 
01:50:00.950 --> 01:50:00.960 align:start position:0%
um Melissa white talk about the 58
 
01:50:03.410 --> 01:50:03.420 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate in special education for
 
01:50:03.420 --> 01:50:04.310 align:start position:0%
vacancy rate in special education for
example

01:50:04.310 --> 01:50:04.320 align:start position:0%
example
 
01:50:07.010 --> 01:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
um I mean it is I can tell you as a
 
01:50:08.570 --> 01:50:08.580 align:start position:0%
director at the Department of Education
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
who has a bunch of employees it is
 
01:50:13.609 --> 01:50:13.619 align:start position:0%
certainly a challenge to recruit
 
01:50:14.629 --> 01:50:14.639 align:start position:0%
um I've been trying to recruit Mickey
 
01:50:18.649 --> 01:50:18.659 align:start position:0%
for years and I just can't get him but
 
01:50:22.129 --> 01:50:22.139 align:start position:0%
um but it is it is it is absolutely a
 
01:50:23.870 --> 01:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
challenge to recruit employees at the
 
01:50:26.510 --> 01:50:26.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Education because it's
 
01:50:28.010 --> 01:50:28.020 align:start position:0%
while you know if there's this
 
01:50:29.270 --> 01:50:29.280 align:start position:0%
perception that government jobs are
 
01:50:30.950 --> 01:50:30.960 align:start position:0%
these safe jobs and they're well paid
 
01:50:32.390 --> 01:50:32.400 align:start position:0%
and everything like that
 
01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
there is a big disconnect between what
 
01:50:35.930 --> 01:50:35.940 align:start position:0%
you can pay somebody in the private
 
01:50:37.370 --> 01:50:37.380 align:start position:0%
sector versus the Department of
 
01:50:39.890 --> 01:50:39.900 align:start position:0%
Education or during as the seat as a
 
01:50:39.900 --> 01:50:40.669 align:start position:0%
Education or during as the seat as a
whole

01:50:40.669 --> 01:50:40.679 align:start position:0%
whole
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
um and especially for us
 
01:50:46.310 --> 01:50:46.320 align:start position:0%
I I have Educators that work for me and
 
01:50:47.870 --> 01:50:47.880 align:start position:0%
these are people they're administrators
 
01:50:49.129 --> 01:50:49.139 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education that
 
01:50:50.570 --> 01:50:50.580 align:start position:0%
otherwise might be a principal or
 
01:50:52.609 --> 01:50:52.619 align:start position:0%
assistant superintendent and would make
 
01:50:55.010 --> 01:50:55.020 align:start position:0%
more in a school district I was myself
 
01:50:56.930 --> 01:50:56.940 align:start position:0%
just offered a business position at a
 
01:50:58.850 --> 01:50:58.860 align:start position:0%
school district that gets paid 30 000
 
01:51:01.010 --> 01:51:01.020 align:start position:0%
more than I get paid right now with a
 
01:51:02.750 --> 01:51:02.760 align:start position:0%
lot less responsibilities than I
 
01:51:03.890 --> 01:51:03.900 align:start position:0%
currently have
 
01:51:05.629 --> 01:51:05.639 align:start position:0%
um so there that is it is something that
 
01:51:07.850 --> 01:51:07.860 align:start position:0%
we are constantly fighting and it is it
 
01:51:09.530 --> 01:51:09.540 align:start position:0%
is a challenge yeah but you miss all
 
01:51:11.450 --> 01:51:11.460 align:start position:0%
this fun I know it's why I said no I
 
01:51:13.070 --> 01:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
said only if I can still work with the
 
01:51:15.530 --> 01:51:15.540 align:start position:0%
division two and they said no so
 
01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:17.149 align:start position:0%
division two and they said no so
Barry

01:51:17.149 --> 01:51:17.159 align:start position:0%
Barry
 
01:51:21.649 --> 01:51:21.659 align:start position:0%
I understand and it's awful that um
 
01:51:24.350 --> 01:51:24.360 align:start position:0%
the way the system is I didn't realize I
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
should have known that that they budget
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
at the base and then when you hire
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
somebody which you have to hire somebody
 
01:51:30.830 --> 01:51:30.840 align:start position:0%
at a higher level because they won't
 
01:51:33.050 --> 01:51:33.060 align:start position:0%
come take the job otherwise that you we
 
01:51:35.450 --> 01:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
have to make up that money
 
01:51:37.669 --> 01:51:37.679 align:start position:0%
um of these
 
01:51:40.070 --> 01:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
is this an area right now because I
 
01:51:43.550 --> 01:51:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't want her to lose those employees
 
01:51:45.169 --> 01:51:45.179 align:start position:0%
um it seems to me I can remember running
 
01:51:47.090 --> 01:51:47.100 align:start position:0%
around scrambling and looking for money
 
01:51:49.189 --> 01:51:49.199 align:start position:0%
at the department because of a similar
 
01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
situation years ago and I used to piece
 
01:51:53.689 --> 01:51:53.699 align:start position:0%
together people's salaries
 
01:51:55.430 --> 01:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
um it was
 
01:51:57.890 --> 01:51:57.900 align:start position:0%
pretty confusing sometimes so can we
 
01:52:00.709 --> 01:52:00.719 align:start position:0%
just um at this point in time for those
 
01:52:03.729 --> 01:52:03.739 align:start position:0%
positions she just described could we
 
01:52:08.209 --> 01:52:08.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:11.209 --> 01:52:11.219 align:start position:0%
800 and I mean that's it's a lot but
 
01:52:14.390 --> 01:52:14.400 align:start position:0%
it's also so understandable and I mean
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
Charlie allenhouse did a great job
 
01:52:19.370 --> 01:52:19.380 align:start position:0%
describing how horrible the situation is
 
01:52:21.410 --> 01:52:21.420 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
01:52:23.030 --> 01:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
um and so Mickey want to maybe to bring
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
up um I did put some funding in there
 
01:52:27.770 --> 01:52:27.780 align:start position:0%
for class 50 for some um so that is an
 
01:52:28.910 --> 01:52:28.920 align:start position:0%
additional increase that we could
 
01:52:30.649 --> 01:52:30.659 align:start position:0%
probably carve out but one of the things
 
01:52:32.149 --> 01:52:32.159 align:start position:0%
that I asked for was some additional
 
01:52:34.669 --> 01:52:34.679 align:start position:0%
class 50 which is the part-time money
 
01:52:36.550 --> 01:52:36.560 align:start position:0%
um to split when you're talking about
 
01:52:39.050 --> 01:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
cobbling together I have some federal
 
01:52:40.609 --> 01:52:40.619 align:start position:0%
employees that I could potentially use
 
01:52:42.169 --> 01:52:42.179 align:start position:0%
to assist with some general fund
 
01:52:44.209 --> 01:52:44.219 align:start position:0%
required reporting and so I added
 
01:52:47.030 --> 01:52:47.040 align:start position:0%
increases in to to do some of that
 
01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:48.229 align:start position:0%
increases in to to do some of that
cobbling

01:52:48.229 --> 01:52:48.239 align:start position:0%
cobbling
 
01:52:50.689 --> 01:52:50.699 align:start position:0%
yeah if I may just very quick note
 
01:52:52.850 --> 01:52:52.860 align:start position:0%
because of the size of the request I
 
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
would prefer that we wait until next
 
01:52:56.270 --> 01:52:56.280 align:start position:0%
week when we hear from the coffee
 
01:52:58.850 --> 01:52:58.860 align:start position:0%
commissioner CFO and we have the full
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
membership so that everybody can open I
 
01:53:03.830 --> 01:53:03.840 align:start position:0%
mean it's just five of us right now and
 
01:53:05.510 --> 01:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
I can provide a breakdown of these
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
numbers too so you can see each
 
01:53:07.970 --> 01:53:07.980 align:start position:0%
accounting unit so a little bit more
 
01:53:09.890 --> 01:53:09.900 align:start position:0%
detail I think might help I'm asking a
 
01:53:11.810 --> 01:53:11.820 align:start position:0%
different question if this is happening
 
01:53:13.490 --> 01:53:13.500 align:start position:0%
in this fiscal year
 
01:53:15.050 --> 01:53:15.060 align:start position:0%
I don't know what's about about next
 
01:53:17.149 --> 01:53:17.159 align:start position:0%
yeah this funding Works to me like it's
 
01:53:19.790 --> 01:53:19.800 align:start position:0%
an operational funding decision made by
 
01:53:21.290 --> 01:53:21.300 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:53:23.149 --> 01:53:23.159 align:start position:0%
rather than extraordinary funding made
 
01:53:25.609 --> 01:53:25.619 align:start position:0%
by the by the state I'm not getting that
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
what do you mean yeah online they do the
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
uh they Department of Education
 
01:53:36.050 --> 01:53:36.060 align:start position:0%
reshuffles people and dollars regardless
 
01:53:37.910 --> 01:53:37.920 align:start position:0%
of what the legislature does I don't
 
01:53:39.290 --> 01:53:39.300 align:start position:0%
know why the legislature is getting
 
01:53:44.209 --> 01:53:44.219 align:start position:0%
involved with funding these oopses that
 
01:53:46.490 --> 01:53:46.500 align:start position:0%
are by structure
 
01:53:48.830 --> 01:53:48.840 align:start position:0%
so essentially what will happen in the
 
01:53:50.090 --> 01:53:50.100 align:start position:0%
long run is the Department of Education
 
01:53:52.070 --> 01:53:52.080 align:start position:0%
will have a shortfall in the amount of
 
01:53:54.229 --> 01:53:54.239 align:start position:0%
appropriation a lot of these shortfalls
 
01:53:56.470 --> 01:53:56.480 align:start position:0%
are often times taken care of with
 
01:53:59.689 --> 01:53:59.699 align:start position:0%
chronic vacancies but if we don't have
 
01:54:01.010 --> 01:54:01.020 align:start position:0%
chronic vacancies then we have
 
01:54:03.890 --> 01:54:03.900 align:start position:0%
shortfalls in appropriation and so
 
01:54:05.450 --> 01:54:05.460 align:start position:0%
but it
 
01:54:07.790 --> 01:54:07.800 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm saying is it sounds to
 
01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:10.920 align:start position:0%
me like this is internal policy of the
 
01:54:13.070 --> 01:54:13.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and if they want
 
01:54:15.649 --> 01:54:15.659 align:start position:0%
to come to the legislature and say
 
01:54:20.390 --> 01:54:20.400 align:start position:0%
man have we blown it and we need X that
 
01:54:22.850 --> 01:54:22.860 align:start position:0%
seems like what we get involved in but I
 
01:54:24.350 --> 01:54:24.360 align:start position:0%
don't know that's exactly what we're
 
01:54:26.090 --> 01:54:26.100 align:start position:0%
doing right now though this is they're
 
01:54:28.669 --> 01:54:28.679 align:start position:0%
saying we've flown it and when we have
 
01:54:29.930 --> 01:54:29.940 align:start position:0%
not blown it but we have hired people
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
within the steps that were allowed to
 
01:54:34.070 --> 01:54:34.080 align:start position:0%
hire people but we just because of the
 
01:54:35.570 --> 01:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
budgeting process and things being
 
01:54:37.250 --> 01:54:37.260 align:start position:0%
budget a lower level we're saying we
 
01:54:38.750 --> 01:54:38.760 align:start position:0%
would like to continue to maintain we
 
01:54:41.390 --> 01:54:41.400 align:start position:0%
need to support our existing staff this
 
01:54:42.830 --> 01:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
is how much we need to support our
 
01:54:45.770 --> 01:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
existing staff but this is exactly what
 
01:54:48.649 --> 01:54:48.659 align:start position:0%
we're we're doing okay then I'll go back
 
01:54:51.950 --> 01:54:51.960 align:start position:0%
to to whose responsibility is it is it
 
01:54:53.750 --> 01:54:53.760 align:start position:0%
the executive branch or is it the
 
01:54:56.510 --> 01:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
legislative branch that fixes this to me
 
01:54:57.950 --> 01:54:57.960 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's the executive branch
 
01:54:59.209 --> 01:54:59.219 align:start position:0%
because they've already got an approved
 
01:55:02.810 --> 01:55:02.820 align:start position:0%
budget for 23. and for us to go meddling
 
01:55:04.850 --> 01:55:04.860 align:start position:0%
it I I just don't understand this is for
 
01:55:07.250 --> 01:55:07.260 align:start position:0%
24 and 25. this is to carry them over
 
01:55:11.570 --> 01:55:11.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:14.270 --> 01:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
no oh so this is this is new budget
 
01:55:16.550 --> 01:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
dollars right right and and it's just
 
01:55:18.290 --> 01:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
it's really it's the timing of when
 
01:55:21.290 --> 01:55:21.300 align:start position:0%
those reports were developed so if if
 
01:55:24.350 --> 01:55:24.360 align:start position:0%
your class 10 or all of these line items
 
01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
was if HH or HHS Das ran that report
 
01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:28.729 align:start position:0%
was if HH or HHS Das ran that report
today

01:55:28.729 --> 01:55:28.739 align:start position:0%
today
 
01:55:30.649 --> 01:55:30.659 align:start position:0%
the report would have these numbers in
 
01:55:30.659 --> 01:55:31.550 align:start position:0%
the report would have these numbers in
it

01:55:31.550 --> 01:55:31.560 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:55:34.550 --> 01:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
but because they ran it in April or
 
01:55:36.050 --> 01:55:36.060 align:start position:0%
whatever it is that they ran it it just
 
01:55:38.709 --> 01:55:38.719 align:start position:0%
didn't have these these changes
 
01:55:41.030 --> 01:55:41.040 align:start position:0%
where I got out of phases you're saying
 
01:55:42.530 --> 01:55:42.540 align:start position:0%
you're talking to somebody come on board
 
01:55:43.609 --> 01:55:43.619 align:start position:0%
this week
 
01:55:47.689 --> 01:55:47.699 align:start position:0%
and I'm in fiscal 23. oh so right well
 
01:55:50.450 --> 01:55:50.460 align:start position:0%
so yes um but so we're talking about
 
01:55:52.370 --> 01:55:52.380 align:start position:0%
they're coming on board right now
 
01:55:55.070 --> 01:55:55.080 align:start position:0%
um in fiscal 23 but I'm saying that
 
01:55:57.590 --> 01:55:57.600 align:start position:0%
amount what they're budgeted for for 24
 
01:56:00.470 --> 01:56:00.480 align:start position:0%
and 25 was based on who was there in 20
 
01:56:02.870 --> 01:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
actually it was in 22 right because that
 
01:56:04.669 --> 01:56:04.679 align:start position:0%
was the time when the report was run so
 
01:56:06.890 --> 01:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
that's how it's just it's just a timing
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
difference of the report okay so during
 
01:56:13.430 --> 01:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
after a budget's passed uh if positions
 
01:56:15.050 --> 01:56:15.060 align:start position:0%
were reclassified or someone was hired
 
01:56:16.609 --> 01:56:16.619 align:start position:0%
at a higher step than it was budgeted
 
01:56:18.410 --> 01:56:18.420 align:start position:0%
the department could move money around
 
01:56:20.570 --> 01:56:20.580 align:start position:0%
between Class 10s and you know similar
 
01:56:22.189 --> 01:56:22.199 align:start position:0%
source of funds from around and then
 
01:56:23.689 --> 01:56:23.699 align:start position:0%
there's also a state salary and benefit
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
adjustment fund if if they had to draw
 
01:56:27.830 --> 01:56:27.840 align:start position:0%
from that what really happens by moving
 
01:56:29.149 --> 01:56:29.159 align:start position:0%
the money around it would just impact
 
01:56:31.310 --> 01:56:31.320 align:start position:0%
their laps so say they use
 
01:56:33.470 --> 01:56:33.480 align:start position:0%
money from a vacant position to pay the
 
01:56:35.090 --> 01:56:35.100 align:start position:0%
other position at the higher rate just
 
01:56:36.290 --> 01:56:36.300 align:start position:0%
means they're going to lapse less at the
 
01:56:37.850 --> 01:56:37.860 align:start position:0%
end of the day what the Department's
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
coming forward with now is
 
01:56:41.870 --> 01:56:41.880 align:start position:0%
because we when this budget is built
 
01:56:43.550 --> 01:56:43.560 align:start position:0%
it's built very specific to every
 
01:56:45.350 --> 01:56:45.360 align:start position:0%
position so for new positions the
 
01:56:47.450 --> 01:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
default is a two-person family plan and
 
01:56:50.030 --> 01:56:50.040 align:start position:0%
step one so if they know now that yeah
 
01:56:52.070 --> 01:56:52.080 align:start position:0%
that vacant position we have budgeted in
 
01:56:54.770 --> 01:56:54.780 align:start position:0%
24 25 as a two-person
 
01:56:56.750 --> 01:56:56.760 align:start position:0%
family or a two-person uh health
 
01:56:58.910 --> 01:56:58.920 align:start position:0%
insurance plan in step one but we
 
01:57:00.169 --> 01:57:00.179 align:start position:0%
already know we're going to hire them at
 
01:57:02.390 --> 01:57:02.400 align:start position:0%
a family plan at a step eight so we know
 
01:57:04.189 --> 01:57:04.199 align:start position:0%
what's in here Associated for that
 
01:57:05.629 --> 01:57:05.639 align:start position:0%
position is low
 
01:57:08.510 --> 01:57:08.520 align:start position:0%
so the department is presenting if you
 
01:57:09.470 --> 01:57:09.480 align:start position:0%
want to fund them you know so that
 
01:57:11.209 --> 01:57:11.219 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at and a question for
 
01:57:12.770 --> 01:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
the CFO and the department when they
 
01:57:15.050 --> 01:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
come in next week would be you know just
 
01:57:16.370 --> 01:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
have them on the record for what does
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
happen in the event that position costs
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
exceed what we budget
 
01:57:23.629 --> 01:57:23.639 align:start position:0%
um one of these is federal funds
 
01:57:23.639 --> 01:57:25.550 align:start position:0%
um one of these is federal funds
um

01:57:25.550 --> 01:57:25.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:57:27.229 --> 01:57:27.239 align:start position:0%
which we don't usually I mean that's not
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
that's outside our jurisdiction do we
 
01:57:30.470 --> 01:57:30.480 align:start position:0%
just approve that part of it that we're
 
01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
at the federal money as opposed to the
 
01:57:33.589 --> 01:57:33.599 align:start position:0%
general fund no I mean federal funds are
 
01:57:33.599 --> 01:57:34.490 align:start position:0%
general fund no I mean federal funds are
are

01:57:34.490 --> 01:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:57:36.530 --> 01:57:36.540 align:start position:0%
um in there too in the budget is just
 
01:57:37.790 --> 01:57:37.800 align:start position:0%
something that's not typically looked at
 
01:57:39.709 --> 01:57:39.719 align:start position:0%
and that those are my positions I said
 
01:57:40.910 --> 01:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
well let's make sure we're appropriating
 
01:57:43.189 --> 01:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
them at the right level I would probably
 
01:57:44.930 --> 01:57:44.940 align:start position:0%
just move money in from our contract
 
01:57:46.669 --> 01:57:46.679 align:start position:0%
line if you weren't to approve it but it
 
01:57:49.010 --> 01:57:49.020 align:start position:0%
just in the spirit of making sure that
 
01:57:51.890 --> 01:57:51.900 align:start position:0%
our budget as as accurate as possible we
 
01:57:53.810 --> 01:57:53.820 align:start position:0%
ask for these funds in this area I guess
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
I'm asking are there two actions to be
 
01:57:58.070 --> 01:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
done here because part of it is General
 
01:57:59.810 --> 01:57:59.820 align:start position:0%
fun and part of it is federal funds does
 
01:58:01.370 --> 01:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
that require two actions on our part
 
01:58:03.770 --> 01:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
because they're different
 
01:58:06.649 --> 01:58:06.659 align:start position:0%
so if the the action is one and then
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
when I do the data entry into the system
 
01:58:09.890 --> 01:58:09.900 align:start position:0%
the source of funds will be split as
 
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:15.770 --> 01:58:15.780 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you uh you mentioned when you
 
01:58:17.209 --> 01:58:17.219 align:start position:0%
move money
 
01:58:20.270 --> 01:58:20.280 align:start position:0%
uh from on on an unfilled position to to
 
01:58:23.030 --> 01:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
maybe this petition uh do they have to
 
01:58:24.709 --> 01:58:24.719 align:start position:0%
go to fiscal and what what's that what's
 
01:58:27.709 --> 01:58:27.719 align:start position:0%
that that monetary amount that uh they
 
01:58:29.930 --> 01:58:29.940 align:start position:0%
have to come before fiscal uh one
 
01:58:32.209 --> 01:58:32.219 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars per year so
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
anything above that uh they would have
 
01:58:36.530 --> 01:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
to get fiscal and GNC approval very good
 
01:58:38.990 --> 01:58:39.000 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you I just have a
 
01:58:41.149 --> 01:58:41.159 align:start position:0%
comment on the budget processing itself
 
01:58:42.890 --> 01:58:42.900 align:start position:0%
and you know it's not about you or
 
01:58:44.689 --> 01:58:44.699 align:start position:0%
anybody else involved in particular
 
01:58:46.310 --> 01:58:46.320 align:start position:0%
about the process
 
01:58:48.530 --> 01:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's kind of difficult you know I
 
01:58:50.930 --> 01:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
understand that you uh you know were
 
01:58:52.970 --> 01:58:52.980 align:start position:0%
asked those positions were unfilled or a
 
01:58:54.229 --> 01:58:54.239 align:start position:0%
different classes and then things
 
01:58:56.330 --> 01:58:56.340 align:start position:0%
happened after the budget process
 
01:58:58.370 --> 01:58:58.380 align:start position:0%
started so now we need to adjust that
 
01:59:01.070 --> 01:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
data but when we adjust
 
01:59:03.709 --> 01:59:03.719 align:start position:0%
you know by removing a lot that creates
 
01:59:06.530 --> 01:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
the ability to say well there are funds
 
01:59:07.850 --> 01:59:07.860 align:start position:0%
available that we are going to put
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
somewhere else and then we come back and
 
01:59:12.530 --> 01:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
ask for more funds in a sense we are
 
01:59:14.450 --> 01:59:14.460 align:start position:0%
creating an additional you know burden
 
01:59:16.669 --> 01:59:16.679 align:start position:0%
because had we known at the beginning
 
01:59:19.370 --> 01:59:19.380 align:start position:0%
that the additional 815k was needed
 
01:59:21.470 --> 01:59:21.480 align:start position:0%
surely the governor would have put it
 
01:59:23.570 --> 01:59:23.580 align:start position:0%
here and they would not have spent 8015
 
01:59:25.189 --> 01:59:25.199 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
01:59:25.199 --> 01:59:26.450 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
so

01:59:26.450 --> 01:59:26.460 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:59:29.149 --> 01:59:29.159 align:start position:0%
I know that nobody can quite see the
 
01:59:32.689 --> 01:59:32.699 align:start position:0%
future but just as a you know thought it
 
01:59:34.910 --> 01:59:34.920 align:start position:0%
would have been so much better if
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
somebody would have you know set aside a
 
01:59:39.169 --> 01:59:39.179 align:start position:0%
reserve because I'm sure he did have
 
01:59:41.450 --> 01:59:41.460 align:start position:0%
plans to try to hire and you knew that
 
01:59:43.669 --> 01:59:43.679 align:start position:0%
this may have been possible and as I
 
01:59:44.629 --> 01:59:44.639 align:start position:0%
said I understand that wasn't
 
01:59:46.250 --> 01:59:46.260 align:start position:0%
necessarily your decision I'm talking
 
01:59:48.530 --> 01:59:48.540 align:start position:0%
about a lot of people involved but
 
01:59:51.050 --> 01:59:51.060 align:start position:0%
it would be nicer if
 
01:59:53.270 --> 01:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
a bit of allowance for this would have
 
01:59:55.189 --> 01:59:55.199 align:start position:0%
made earlier in the process because now
 
01:59:56.930 --> 01:59:56.940 align:start position:0%
at the time when we get the budget we
 
01:59:58.490 --> 01:59:58.500 align:start position:0%
would have had the ability to cut it
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
down if it was needed but the other way
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
around it's a bit harder so of course
 
02:00:04.430 --> 02:00:04.440 align:start position:0%
we'll you know deal with this
 
02:00:06.410 --> 02:00:06.420 align:start position:0%
appropriately it's not about the
 
02:00:08.689 --> 02:00:08.699 align:start position:0%
decision on this 815 just as I said for
 
02:00:10.930 --> 02:00:10.940 align:start position:0%
the next budget cycle more of a
 
02:00:13.250 --> 02:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
philosophical thought on how an ideal
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
process was there is just no mechanism
 
02:00:16.490 --> 02:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
with their current process to do that
 
02:00:19.450 --> 02:00:19.460 align:start position:0%
because it is it is allocated at a very
 
02:00:21.830 --> 02:00:21.840 align:start position:0%
specific individual level it literally
 
02:00:23.750 --> 02:00:23.760 align:start position:0%
says Caitlyn Davis is going to get a
 
02:00:26.089 --> 02:00:26.099 align:start position:0%
step at this time and period and budget
 
02:00:27.830 --> 02:00:27.840 align:start position:0%
fully understood that's why my comment
 
02:00:30.290 --> 02:00:30.300 align:start position:0%
is on the process itself and on the fact
 
02:00:31.910 --> 02:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
that had we
 
02:00:34.370 --> 02:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
had a mechanism like this to say the
 
02:00:36.169 --> 02:00:36.179 align:start position:0%
department is expecting to fill a few
 
02:00:38.330 --> 02:00:38.340 align:start position:0%
more positions and you know when you
 
02:00:40.310 --> 02:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
budget early in the cycle you know you
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
have time to trim it down later based on
 
02:00:44.330 --> 02:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
what happened when we are early we have
 
02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:45.900 align:start position:0%
less information we should have some
 
02:00:48.350 --> 02:00:48.360 align:start position:0%
leeway Possible only if obviously those
 
02:00:49.970 --> 02:00:49.980 align:start position:0%
plans were known no it's complicated I'm
 
02:00:51.410 --> 02:00:51.420 align:start position:0%
not saying there is a clear-cut answer
 
02:00:54.350 --> 02:00:54.360 align:start position:0%
but I I think at some point if you're
 
02:00:56.290 --> 02:00:56.300 align:start position:0%
going to enjoy a Charlie Arling house
 
02:00:59.510 --> 02:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
explanation of the structure of this
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
system he's very good at it I believe I
 
02:01:03.770 --> 02:01:03.780 align:start position:0%
will enjoy it I I found his comments
 
02:01:05.750 --> 02:01:05.760 align:start position:0%
very enjoyable overall he's he's really
 
02:01:07.550 --> 02:01:07.560 align:start position:0%
good at it
 
02:01:10.970 --> 02:01:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:13.149 --> 02:01:13.159 align:start position:0%
he brought structure
 
02:01:17.810 --> 02:01:17.820 align:start position:0%
okay anything else um I just so one
 
02:01:19.250 --> 02:01:19.260 align:start position:0%
thing I actually wanted to see if the
 
02:01:20.930 --> 02:01:20.940 align:start position:0%
committee had any questions or concerns
 
02:01:22.490 --> 02:01:22.500 align:start position:0%
on or wanted to have a conversation with
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
is the movement of the assessment
 
02:01:27.290 --> 02:01:27.300 align:start position:0%
program to the education trust fund
 
02:01:29.510 --> 02:01:29.520 align:start position:0%
um it is a decision that we made in
 
02:01:30.890 --> 02:01:30.900 align:start position:0%
collaboration with the governor's office
 
02:01:33.229 --> 02:01:33.239 align:start position:0%
and it is we would like to see it stay
 
02:01:34.970 --> 02:01:34.980 align:start position:0%
there in the education trust fund with
 
02:01:36.770 --> 02:01:36.780 align:start position:0%
the funding level
 
02:01:38.330 --> 02:01:38.340 align:start position:0%
um and I just don't know if you want me
 
02:01:40.490 --> 02:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
to explain that real quick I don't have
 
02:01:44.750 --> 02:01:44.760 align:start position:0%
I I think it's fine okay
 
02:01:48.229 --> 02:01:48.239 align:start position:0%
and what's hap what's happening as
 
02:01:50.629 --> 02:01:50.639 align:start position:0%
you're very well aware is the education
 
02:01:54.589 --> 02:01:54.599 align:start position:0%
trust fund is wildly over funded and so
 
02:01:57.350 --> 02:01:57.360 align:start position:0%
our chairman at this point in time all
 
02:02:02.229 --> 02:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
right our chairman is uh working through
 
02:02:05.689 --> 02:02:05.699 align:start position:0%
reducing the amount of feed going into
 
02:02:07.910 --> 02:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
it because once it's in there it can't
 
02:02:12.790 --> 02:02:12.800 align:start position:0%
be used for General funds and his his
 
02:02:16.250 --> 02:02:16.260 align:start position:0%
strategy is to reduce the contributions
 
02:02:18.229 --> 02:02:18.239 align:start position:0%
you know there's a seven there are eight
 
02:02:18.239 --> 02:02:19.089 align:start position:0%
you know there's a seven there are eight
different

02:02:19.089 --> 02:02:19.099 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:02:21.890 --> 02:02:21.900 align:start position:0%
contributing uh
 
02:02:24.410 --> 02:02:24.420 align:start position:0%
departments or organizations or
 
02:02:26.290 --> 02:02:26.300 align:start position:0%
he said let's reduce
 
02:02:29.330 --> 02:02:29.340 align:start position:0%
business profits tax for example
 
02:02:31.129 --> 02:02:31.139 align:start position:0%
I think the governor's budget had a
 
02:02:35.030 --> 02:02:35.040 align:start position:0%
reduction uh so like 65 or something so
 
02:02:38.510 --> 02:02:38.520 align:start position:0%
the idea is to get the education trust
 
02:02:41.570 --> 02:02:41.580 align:start position:0%
fund back to where it was originally
 
02:02:45.649 --> 02:02:45.659 align:start position:0%
uh put together was to say that we are
 
02:02:47.330 --> 02:02:47.340 align:start position:0%
going to fund education but it's true
 
02:02:48.890 --> 02:02:48.900 align:start position:0%
what it's turned into is the education
 
02:02:50.330 --> 02:02:50.340 align:start position:0%
slush fund
 
02:02:53.689 --> 02:02:53.699 align:start position:0%
and so it's nice that every education
 
02:02:55.729 --> 02:02:55.739 align:start position:0%
stuff can go through there but it's what
 
02:02:59.209 --> 02:02:59.219 align:start position:0%
it's doing it's robbing general fund uh
 
02:03:01.250 --> 02:03:01.260 align:start position:0%
to the exclusion of what what should we
 
02:03:02.689 --> 02:03:02.699 align:start position:0%
do with those funds somewhere else
 
02:03:06.109 --> 02:03:06.119 align:start position:0%
rather than carrying these balances in
 
02:03:08.750 --> 02:03:08.760 align:start position:0%
the educational trust fund so
 
02:03:11.870 --> 02:03:11.880 align:start position:0%
the answer is it's there for now okay
 
02:03:13.310 --> 02:03:13.320 align:start position:0%
okay and we had moved it in there too
 
02:03:13.320 --> 02:03:14.089 align:start position:0%
okay and we had moved it in there too
because

02:03:14.089 --> 02:03:14.099 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:03:16.310 --> 02:03:16.320 align:start position:0%
um the state assessment is really what
 
02:03:18.050 --> 02:03:18.060 align:start position:0%
is measure the measurement for when I
 
02:03:19.550 --> 02:03:19.560 align:start position:0%
was talking about looking at our school
 
02:03:21.229 --> 02:03:21.239 align:start position:0%
districts and their ability to provide
 
02:03:22.669 --> 02:03:22.679 align:start position:0%
an adequate education we're using the
 
02:03:24.589 --> 02:03:24.599 align:start position:0%
state assessment so what we moved into
 
02:03:26.870 --> 02:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund was only the
 
02:03:28.970 --> 02:03:28.980 align:start position:0%
portion of the assessments that relate
 
02:03:31.430 --> 02:03:31.440 align:start position:0%
to the vendor costs of operating the
 
02:03:32.750 --> 02:03:32.760 align:start position:0%
assessment at the school district so
 
02:03:35.149 --> 02:03:35.159 align:start position:0%
it's all all of that funding is going to
 
02:03:36.709 --> 02:03:36.719 align:start position:0%
help school districts assess children
 
02:03:38.270 --> 02:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
and so that's really what the the
 
02:03:40.250 --> 02:03:40.260 align:start position:0%
decision was by on behalf of the
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
department so
 
02:03:43.850 --> 02:03:43.860 align:start position:0%
I'll just Mr chairman I was just
 
02:03:46.729 --> 02:03:46.739 align:start position:0%
outlining your strategy of reducing the
 
02:03:49.729 --> 02:03:49.739 align:start position:0%
inputs to the education press fund so
 
02:03:51.589 --> 02:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
that it Narrows down
 
02:03:55.189 --> 02:03:55.199 align:start position:0%
so yeah because the concept and its
 
02:03:58.430 --> 02:03:58.440 align:start position:0%
Inception is in 2009
 
02:04:02.030 --> 02:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
yes no 99.
 
02:04:06.050 --> 02:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
was we have to address the Claremont
 
02:04:06.060 --> 02:04:07.189 align:start position:0%
was we have to address the Claremont
decision

02:04:07.189 --> 02:04:07.199 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:04:09.229 --> 02:04:09.239 align:start position:0%
that says the state must pay for
 
02:04:09.239 --> 02:04:10.669 align:start position:0%
that says the state must pay for
education

02:04:10.669 --> 02:04:10.679 align:start position:0%
education
 
02:04:10.679 --> 02:04:12.109 align:start position:0%
education
so

02:04:12.109 --> 02:04:12.119 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:04:15.169 --> 02:04:15.179 align:start position:0%
we first sat down and derived what
 
02:04:17.390 --> 02:04:17.400 align:start position:0%
adequacy was
 
02:04:20.149 --> 02:04:20.159 align:start position:0%
then we funded it
 
02:04:22.790 --> 02:04:22.800 align:start position:0%
and so we created the education trust
 
02:04:26.149 --> 02:04:26.159 align:start position:0%
fund just to cover adequacy as a matter
 
02:04:28.609 --> 02:04:28.619 align:start position:0%
of fact to cover a little less
 
02:04:31.310 --> 02:04:31.320 align:start position:0%
because if we made made more
 
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
the money was lost for anything else
 
02:04:36.050 --> 02:04:36.060 align:start position:0%
and we had a budget to come so we'll
 
02:04:37.970 --> 02:04:37.980 align:start position:0%
make it a little less
 
02:04:40.550 --> 02:04:40.560 align:start position:0%
so we can add we can add General funds
 
02:04:43.010 --> 02:04:43.020 align:start position:0%
to it but if it exceeds
 
02:04:45.050 --> 02:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
what they needed what can we do with the
 
02:04:46.430 --> 02:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
rest of the money at the time we didn't
 
02:04:47.810 --> 02:04:47.820 align:start position:0%
have any idea what to do with them
 
02:04:51.169 --> 02:04:51.179 align:start position:0%
except to give it to education so
 
02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
I think we need to reduce the inputs to
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund rather than say
 
02:04:58.070 --> 02:04:58.080 align:start position:0%
oh we could spend it on this we could
 
02:04:59.810 --> 02:04:59.820 align:start position:0%
spend it on that we could spend no I
 
02:05:01.310 --> 02:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
think we need to go back to what was
 
02:05:03.470 --> 02:05:03.480 align:start position:0%
Inception was
 
02:05:06.350 --> 02:05:06.360 align:start position:0%
and we still will fund everything else
 
02:05:10.450 --> 02:05:10.460 align:start position:0%
but we need to do that for the
 
02:05:14.689 --> 02:05:14.699 align:start position:0%
Court decision we must fund education
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
so surprisingly people have sued us
 
02:05:20.209 --> 02:05:20.219 align:start position:0%
under 28a
 
02:05:22.910 --> 02:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
if some little bit was added to it that
 
02:05:25.250 --> 02:05:25.260 align:start position:0%
you've got to spend this on
 
02:05:28.729 --> 02:05:28.739 align:start position:0%
and the decision came back if they gave
 
02:05:30.709 --> 02:05:30.719 align:start position:0%
you some money and they didn't tell you
 
02:05:32.990 --> 02:05:33.000 align:start position:0%
exactly where it had to be spent how can
 
02:05:34.669 --> 02:05:34.679 align:start position:0%
you say that they can't tell you to
 
02:05:35.870 --> 02:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
spend a little more somewhere else
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
because they already gave you money
 
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
they gave you a billion dollars
 
02:05:40.560 --> 02:05:42.010 align:start position:0%
they gave you a billion dollars
so

02:05:42.010 --> 02:05:42.020 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:05:44.209 --> 02:05:44.219 align:start position:0%
the idea like
 
02:05:46.370 --> 02:05:46.380 align:start position:0%
the one with
 
02:05:49.910 --> 02:05:49.920 align:start position:0%
menstruation products oh we never we
 
02:05:52.189 --> 02:05:52.199 align:start position:0%
never funded it that wouldn't that
 
02:05:53.390 --> 02:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
wouldn't hold up
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
they went to court they'd say wait a
 
02:05:56.689 --> 02:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
minute how much did they give you but we
 
02:05:58.129 --> 02:05:58.139 align:start position:0%
wanted another
 
02:06:01.250 --> 02:06:01.260 align:start position:0%
1500 for this but they gave you 10
 
02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:03.290 align:start position:0%
1500 for this but they gave you 10
million

02:06:03.290 --> 02:06:03.300 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:06:07.970 --> 02:06:07.980 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:10.010 --> 02:06:10.020 align:start position:0%
this that's the way this this thing kind
 
02:06:11.169 --> 02:06:11.179 align:start position:0%
of Falls up
 
02:06:13.910 --> 02:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
well were you objecting to it no no
 
02:06:19.189 --> 02:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:22.070 --> 02:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
um yes it's a good time to break for
 
02:06:22.080 --> 02:06:26.089 align:start position:0%
um yes it's a good time to break for
lunch

02:06:26.089 --> 02:06:26.099 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:27.290 --> 02:06:27.300 align:start position:0%
so what are we going to do we're gonna
 
02:06:40.930 --> 02:06:40.940 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:45.470 --> 02:06:45.480 align:start position:0%
or more she will only take more
 
02:06:45.480 --> 03:01:12.050 align:start position:0%
or more she will only take more
flower

03:01:12.050 --> 03:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:15.190 --> 03:01:15.200 align:start position:0%
being the appointed hour
 
03:01:18.230 --> 03:01:18.240 align:start position:0%
we have from the governor's office Adam
 
03:01:22.309 --> 03:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
crapo who's the policy director and the
 
03:01:24.590 --> 03:01:24.600 align:start position:0%
show is yours at this point
 
03:01:26.389 --> 03:01:26.399 align:start position:0%
great thank you Mr chairman good
 
03:01:28.670 --> 03:01:28.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon my name is Adam crapo I'm the
 
03:01:30.050 --> 03:01:30.060 align:start position:0%
governor's policy director as you just
 
03:01:32.030 --> 03:01:32.040 align:start position:0%
heard I'm here today to talk to you
 
03:01:33.230 --> 03:01:33.240 align:start position:0%
about the governor's Innovative
 
03:01:35.570 --> 03:01:35.580 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development student debt
 
03:01:37.010 --> 03:01:37.020 align:start position:0%
relief program
 
03:01:38.570 --> 03:01:38.580 align:start position:0%
as you'll hear from others behind me
 
03:01:40.490 --> 03:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
there's a critical Workforce shortage
 
03:01:42.530 --> 03:01:42.540 align:start position:0%
across the state but especially in the
 
03:01:43.910 --> 03:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
medical professions
 
03:01:45.830 --> 03:01:45.840 align:start position:0%
in order to attract more medical
 
03:01:48.230 --> 03:01:48.240 align:start position:0%
professionals we need to do two things
 
03:01:52.130 --> 03:01:52.140 align:start position:0%
which I think hp2 does decrease barriers
 
03:01:54.830 --> 03:01:54.840 align:start position:0%
to entry in those professions through
 
03:01:56.690 --> 03:01:56.700 align:start position:0%
you know licensing reform and Universal
 
03:01:58.849 --> 03:01:58.859 align:start position:0%
recognition but also to increase the
 
03:02:00.650 --> 03:02:00.660 align:start position:0%
incentive to work here
 
03:02:03.050 --> 03:02:03.060 align:start position:0%
hb2 attempts to accomplish both of these
 
03:02:06.170 --> 03:02:06.180 align:start position:0%
goals by doing uh by targeting student
 
03:02:09.170 --> 03:02:09.180 align:start position:0%
debt relief for specific Industries
 
03:02:11.389 --> 03:02:11.399 align:start position:0%
um the Workforce Development student
 
03:02:13.790 --> 03:02:13.800 align:start position:0%
debt program proposes to provide
 
03:02:15.590 --> 03:02:15.600 align:start position:0%
targeted student debt relief to the
 
03:02:18.370 --> 03:02:18.380 align:start position:0%
medical professions Biotech Industry
 
03:02:20.590 --> 03:02:20.600 align:start position:0%
individuals at the state hospital
 
03:02:23.630 --> 03:02:23.640 align:start position:0%
Glencliff the veterans home and other
 
03:02:25.849 --> 03:02:25.859 align:start position:0%
in-demand fields as determined by the
 
03:02:27.410 --> 03:02:27.420 align:start position:0%
commissioner of business and economic
 
03:02:29.630 --> 03:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
Affairs in consultation with the
 
03:02:32.210 --> 03:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
committee established in this bill
 
03:02:34.309 --> 03:02:34.319 align:start position:0%
this is all accomplished without any
 
03:02:36.230 --> 03:02:36.240 align:start position:0%
cost to taxpayers and I won't say that
 
03:02:38.570 --> 03:02:38.580 align:start position:0%
again no cost to taxpayers it's this is
 
03:02:40.389 --> 03:02:40.399 align:start position:0%
existing funding
 
03:02:43.309 --> 03:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
as a division of you know of this
 
03:02:44.690 --> 03:02:44.700 align:start position:0%
committee you might be asking how we're
 
03:02:47.510 --> 03:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
going to pay for this our plan invests
 
03:02:49.429 --> 03:02:49.439 align:start position:0%
50 of the revenue the state receives
 
03:02:52.570 --> 03:02:52.580 align:start position:0%
from the Fidelity 529 plans to go toward
 
03:02:55.790 --> 03:02:55.800 align:start position:0%
targeted student debt relief for the
 
03:02:58.309 --> 03:02:58.319 align:start position:0%
industries I mentioned before
 
03:03:01.429 --> 03:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
um this Revenue would go to the BFA uh
 
03:03:03.410 --> 03:03:03.420 align:start position:0%
you see we have James key Wallace behind
 
03:03:03.420 --> 03:03:04.670 align:start position:0%
you see we have James key Wallace behind
me

03:03:04.670 --> 03:03:04.680 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:03:05.929 --> 03:03:05.939 align:start position:0%
um and they'll be administering the
 
03:03:08.210 --> 03:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
program I'll turn it over to him in a
 
03:03:10.490 --> 03:03:10.500 align:start position:0%
few minutes but you know as a condition
 
03:03:12.889 --> 03:03:12.899 align:start position:0%
of forgiveness students pursuing careers
 
03:03:14.870 --> 03:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in these specific
 
03:03:16.969 --> 03:03:16.979 align:start position:0%
Fields such as medical fields and some
 
03:03:18.410 --> 03:03:18.420 align:start position:0%
of those positions within the state will
 
03:03:19.910 --> 03:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
be able to become debt free after three
 
03:03:22.010 --> 03:03:22.020 align:start position:0%
years of living here and working for a
 
03:03:23.630 --> 03:03:23.640 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire employer
 
03:03:25.670 --> 03:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
all in all this would be the largest
 
03:03:28.370 --> 03:03:28.380 align:start position:0%
ever ongoing Workforce incentive program
 
03:03:30.590 --> 03:03:30.600 align:start position:0%
for students uh Student Assistance and
 
03:03:32.450 --> 03:03:32.460 align:start position:0%
State history
 
03:03:35.510 --> 03:03:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to take any questions
 
03:03:36.769 --> 03:03:36.779 align:start position:0%
on this
 
03:03:36.779 --> 03:03:39.050 align:start position:0%
on this
questions

03:03:39.050 --> 03:03:39.060 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:03:42.230 --> 03:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair historically These
 
03:03:44.389 --> 03:03:44.399 align:start position:0%
funds have gone to
 
03:03:46.670 --> 03:03:46.680 align:start position:0%
um provide scholarships for New
 
03:03:48.050 --> 03:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire students
 
03:03:51.769 --> 03:03:51.779 align:start position:0%
so you're diverting 50 of those dollars
 
03:03:53.809 --> 03:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
for this purpose
 
03:03:56.690 --> 03:03:56.700 align:start position:0%
in a year where we have a surplus
 
03:03:59.030 --> 03:03:59.040 align:start position:0%
um I just think it would be a great use
 
03:04:02.150 --> 03:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
of um surplus funds to do this because I
 
03:04:03.650 --> 03:04:03.660 align:start position:0%
agree with you I think this is an
 
03:04:06.050 --> 03:04:06.060 align:start position:0%
absolutely essential
 
03:04:09.050 --> 03:04:09.060 align:start position:0%
um element that we need to look at and
 
03:04:11.750 --> 03:04:11.760 align:start position:0%
getting employees right now we've had
 
03:04:13.790 --> 03:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
that conversation with every single
 
03:04:16.010 --> 03:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
agency we've seen it's been very
 
03:04:18.349 --> 03:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
difficult to say the least
 
03:04:21.050 --> 03:04:21.060 align:start position:0%
um a pay raise for state workers is
 
03:04:23.030 --> 03:04:23.040 align:start position:0%
critical because at least people are
 
03:04:24.410 --> 03:04:24.420 align:start position:0%
paying more attention to working from
 
03:04:25.910 --> 03:04:25.920 align:start position:0%
the state before they just turn their
 
03:04:27.769 --> 03:04:27.779 align:start position:0%
heads because it just doesn't pay they
 
03:04:29.210 --> 03:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
can make more McDonald's practically
 
03:04:31.010 --> 03:04:31.020 align:start position:0%
then they they can working for the state
 
03:04:34.370 --> 03:04:34.380 align:start position:0%
so I agree with you we need to do this
 
03:04:37.130 --> 03:04:37.140 align:start position:0%
kind of work but I just I am struggling
 
03:04:40.070 --> 03:04:40.080 align:start position:0%
with using those dollars that come from
 
03:04:42.469 --> 03:04:42.479 align:start position:0%
the 529 fund
 
03:04:45.170 --> 03:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
um and um I'm sure later on we can um
 
03:04:46.849 --> 03:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
we're going to hear from other people I
 
03:04:48.530 --> 03:04:48.540 align:start position:0%
presume and maybe they can talk about
 
03:04:49.849 --> 03:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
some of the
 
03:04:53.690 --> 03:04:53.700 align:start position:0%
ways in which those funds have been used
 
03:04:55.969 --> 03:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
um so can you just think about other
 
03:04:58.490 --> 03:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
funds that that might be directed toward
 
03:05:01.610 --> 03:05:01.620 align:start position:0%
this effort rather than the for the 529
 
03:05:04.610 --> 03:05:04.620 align:start position:0%
funds thank you representative yet so I
 
03:05:06.710 --> 03:05:06.720 align:start position:0%
you know I think we have a commonality
 
03:05:08.750 --> 03:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
in that we agree with the pay increases
 
03:05:10.610 --> 03:05:10.620 align:start position:0%
in the budget
 
03:05:10.620 --> 03:05:11.389 align:start position:0%
in the budget
um

03:05:11.389 --> 03:05:11.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:14.929 --> 03:05:14.939 align:start position:0%
under this plan 40 of the revenue from
 
03:05:18.110 --> 03:05:18.120 align:start position:0%
the 529 plans would still go toward the
 
03:05:19.490 --> 03:05:19.500 align:start position:0%
scholarships that you met you mentioned
 
03:05:21.889 --> 03:05:21.899 align:start position:0%
the unique scholarships
 
03:05:25.010 --> 03:05:25.020 align:start position:0%
um 50 would go toward student debt
 
03:05:30.830 --> 03:05:30.840 align:start position:0%
relief and 10 up to 10 would go to the
 
03:05:30.840 --> 03:05:32.330 align:start position:0%
relief and 10 up to 10 would go to the
endowments

03:05:32.330 --> 03:05:32.340 align:start position:0%
endowments
 
03:05:34.550 --> 03:05:34.560 align:start position:0%
um I think currently and Monica will
 
03:05:36.170 --> 03:05:36.180 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong but I think
 
03:05:37.969 --> 03:05:37.979 align:start position:0%
currently I think it's uh third twenty
 
03:05:39.170 --> 03:05:39.180 align:start position:0%
or thirty percent that go to the
 
03:05:39.180 --> 03:05:40.790 align:start position:0%
or thirty percent that go to the
endowments

03:05:40.790 --> 03:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
endowments
 
03:05:43.070 --> 03:05:43.080 align:start position:0%
um so so that's sort of how that's
 
03:05:45.830 --> 03:05:45.840 align:start position:0%
structured currently I I believe it is
 
03:05:48.950 --> 03:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
70 that goes to the
 
03:05:54.790 --> 03:05:54.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:56.809 --> 03:05:56.819 align:start position:0%
30 30.
 
03:05:59.870 --> 03:05:59.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so currently it's 30 uh 30 that
 
03:06:02.150 --> 03:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
goes to the endowments and 70 right that
 
03:06:04.130 --> 03:06:04.140 align:start position:0%
goes to the direct scholarships okay
 
03:06:05.870 --> 03:06:05.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:06:09.230 --> 03:06:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:11.929 --> 03:06:11.939 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:06:13.490 --> 03:06:13.500 align:start position:0%
taking the questions and for being here
 
03:06:15.650 --> 03:06:15.660 align:start position:0%
from for being here
 
03:06:15.660 --> 03:06:17.030 align:start position:0%
from for being here
um

03:06:17.030 --> 03:06:17.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:19.370 --> 03:06:19.380 align:start position:0%
let us let me say that no cost of the
 
03:06:21.710 --> 03:06:21.720 align:start position:0%
taxpayers uh it's no new cost to the
 
03:06:23.330 --> 03:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
taxpayers right at the end of the day
 
03:06:27.050 --> 03:06:27.060 align:start position:0%
you know there is always a cost but
 
03:06:28.790 --> 03:06:28.800 align:start position:0%
um my question is on the program
 
03:06:31.550 --> 03:06:31.560 align:start position:0%
specifically uh you said they will be
 
03:06:33.590 --> 03:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
debt-free after three years were living
 
03:06:35.510 --> 03:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
here and working for a employer in
 
03:06:36.830 --> 03:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
certain fields
 
03:06:39.410 --> 03:06:39.420 align:start position:0%
I want to understand you know when you
 
03:06:42.769 --> 03:06:42.779 align:start position:0%
say debt free are we gonna pay the loans
 
03:06:44.690 --> 03:06:44.700 align:start position:0%
where are what's the source of the loans
 
03:06:46.429 --> 03:06:46.439 align:start position:0%
that they would be paying and how would
 
03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
we pay them for example you know do we
 
03:06:49.200 --> 03:06:49.910 align:start position:0%
we pay them for example you know do we
just

03:06:49.910 --> 03:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
just
 
03:06:53.330 --> 03:06:53.340 align:start position:0%
pay off the balance or do we let it go
 
03:06:55.250 --> 03:06:55.260 align:start position:0%
because it's from us I would appreciate
 
03:06:57.050 --> 03:06:57.060 align:start position:0%
some details
 
03:06:59.690 --> 03:06:59.700 align:start position:0%
so the way the way it's structured
 
03:07:02.349 --> 03:07:02.359 align:start position:0%
currently in this bill is that the BFA
 
03:07:05.870 --> 03:07:05.880 align:start position:0%
would after three years of a student
 
03:07:09.110 --> 03:07:09.120 align:start position:0%
after they graduate they work in a New
 
03:07:12.710 --> 03:07:12.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire business and they have to work
 
03:07:14.510 --> 03:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
there for at least three years and there
 
03:07:16.070 --> 03:07:16.080 align:start position:0%
are some other qualifying conditions but
 
03:07:18.349 --> 03:07:18.359 align:start position:0%
they have to be and you know one of the
 
03:07:21.469 --> 03:07:21.479 align:start position:0%
fields and all of that but after three
 
03:07:26.210 --> 03:07:26.220 align:start position:0%
years the BFA would provide a a sum to
 
03:07:28.250 --> 03:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
pay off either the balance or a portion
 
03:07:29.990 --> 03:07:30.000 align:start position:0%
of the balance
 
03:07:34.130 --> 03:07:34.140 align:start position:0%
um and really the with this proposal
 
03:07:37.490 --> 03:07:37.500 align:start position:0%
looks to do is to give the authority to
 
03:07:40.190 --> 03:07:40.200 align:start position:0%
start creating the program and the BFA
 
03:07:41.809 --> 03:07:41.819 align:start position:0%
would come back to the fiscal committee
 
03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:45.680 align:start position:0%
once the program is
 
03:07:49.010 --> 03:07:49.020 align:start position:0%
fleshed out and and the fiscal committee
 
03:07:50.809 --> 03:07:50.819 align:start position:0%
would determine whether or not to move
 
03:07:52.790 --> 03:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
forward with that plan and offer
 
03:07:54.650 --> 03:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
feedback to that plan
 
03:07:56.330 --> 03:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up
 
03:07:59.269 --> 03:07:59.279 align:start position:0%
um I understand that I appreciate it my
 
03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
other question is about the duration the
 
03:08:02.870 --> 03:08:02.880 align:start position:0%
three years
 
03:08:05.690 --> 03:08:05.700 align:start position:0%
I am not an expert in the field but it
 
03:08:08.630 --> 03:08:08.640 align:start position:0%
feels slightly short I I'm just trying
 
03:08:10.370 --> 03:08:10.380 align:start position:0%
to understand how the number came up
 
03:08:12.110 --> 03:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
with what are your thoughts in terms of
 
03:08:13.730 --> 03:08:13.740 align:start position:0%
whether this is the appropriate length
 
03:08:15.950 --> 03:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
of time to require them to be here
 
03:08:18.710 --> 03:08:18.720 align:start position:0%
before this is Forgiven or or paid off
 
03:08:21.170 --> 03:08:21.180 align:start position:0%
and any thoughts on whether that's the
 
03:08:23.929 --> 03:08:23.939 align:start position:0%
most uh you know effective
 
03:08:26.929 --> 03:08:26.939 align:start position:0%
time frame so in the past when we've
 
03:08:28.670 --> 03:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
presented this proposal I believe it's
 
03:08:30.290 --> 03:08:30.300 align:start position:0%
been five years
 
03:08:33.530 --> 03:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
um three years we thought was
 
03:08:36.469 --> 03:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
um a a sufficient enough time and it's
 
03:08:38.090 --> 03:08:38.100 align:start position:0%
in line with other
 
03:08:40.550 --> 03:08:40.560 align:start position:0%
um student debt relief programs uh I
 
03:08:42.290 --> 03:08:42.300 align:start position:0%
believe it's called the it's called
 
03:08:45.769 --> 03:08:45.779 align:start position:0%
slurp that's the acronym for it that HHS
 
03:08:47.690 --> 03:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
um administers
 
03:08:49.130 --> 03:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
um so it's in line with that that
 
03:08:51.349 --> 03:08:51.359 align:start position:0%
similar proposal so that's that's where
 
03:08:53.450 --> 03:08:53.460 align:start position:0%
the three years came from
 
03:08:58.070 --> 03:08:58.080 align:start position:0%
um but but it would defer on on those
 
03:08:59.750 --> 03:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
um on how you want to structure the
 
03:09:01.490 --> 03:09:01.500 align:start position:0%
years you know I think you know in the
 
03:09:02.769 --> 03:09:02.779 align:start position:0%
past we've been happy with five years
 
03:09:06.710 --> 03:09:06.720 align:start position:0%
we're okay with three years so
 
03:09:08.990 --> 03:09:09.000 align:start position:0%
thank you I appreciate
 
03:09:11.090 --> 03:09:11.100 align:start position:0%
just one more question do you know the
 
03:09:13.910 --> 03:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
number of New Hampshire college students
 
03:09:16.250 --> 03:09:16.260 align:start position:0%
that would not get a loan because of
 
03:09:19.670 --> 03:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:21.170 --> 03:09:21.180 align:start position:0%
do you mean under the scholarship
 
03:09:22.910 --> 03:09:22.920 align:start position:0%
program under the current scholarship
 
03:09:26.929 --> 03:09:26.939 align:start position:0%
program if we move to the your proposal
 
03:09:31.190 --> 03:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
how many students will not get an award
 
03:09:33.469 --> 03:09:33.479 align:start position:0%
I don't I don't have that but I'm sure
 
03:09:35.510 --> 03:09:35.520 align:start position:0%
our state treasurer has has some
 
03:09:38.990 --> 03:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
information on that my my assumption is
 
03:09:39.000 --> 03:09:40.250 align:start position:0%
information on that my my assumption is
that

03:09:40.250 --> 03:09:40.260 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:09:42.830 --> 03:09:42.840 align:start position:0%
um you know currently I think it's uh
 
03:09:46.969 --> 03:09:46.979 align:start position:0%
1300 1300 that we offer to students up
 
03:09:49.490 --> 03:09:49.500 align:start position:0%
front for the scholarships but she'll be
 
03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
able to answer that question for you
 
03:09:54.170 --> 03:09:54.180 align:start position:0%
I just want to say this is one of the
 
03:09:57.349 --> 03:09:57.359 align:start position:0%
ways it helps to retain students in the
 
03:09:59.929 --> 03:09:59.939 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and I believe
 
03:10:02.150 --> 03:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
that keeping our young people in New
 
03:10:03.889 --> 03:10:03.899 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a priority for all of us
 
03:10:05.750 --> 03:10:05.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:10:08.630 --> 03:10:08.640 align:start position:0%
yes I would agree that
 
03:10:10.490 --> 03:10:10.500 align:start position:0%
um that this does keep students here in
 
03:10:12.769 --> 03:10:12.779 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh under the unique
 
03:10:16.370 --> 03:10:16.380 align:start position:0%
scholarships however I I will you just
 
03:10:18.590 --> 03:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
have to say that under the the student
 
03:10:21.349 --> 03:10:21.359 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness program we are required
 
03:10:23.990 --> 03:10:24.000 align:start position:0%
requiring people to stay here as a
 
03:10:27.190 --> 03:10:27.200 align:start position:0%
condition of of that program so uh while
 
03:10:30.950 --> 03:10:30.960 align:start position:0%
the current setup does incentivize I
 
03:10:32.769 --> 03:10:32.779 align:start position:0%
think the the the
 
03:10:35.750 --> 03:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
proposal would would give a hundred
 
03:10:37.130 --> 03:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
percent of of those people who would get
 
03:10:41.990 --> 03:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:44.030 --> 03:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
two things one to clarify
 
03:10:47.389 --> 03:10:47.399 align:start position:0%
percent is 50 of the money that goes to
 
03:10:49.550 --> 03:10:49.560 align:start position:0%
scholarships now not 50 of the entire
 
03:10:49.560 --> 03:10:51.349 align:start position:0%
scholarships now not 50 of the entire
fund

03:10:51.349 --> 03:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
fund
 
03:10:54.050 --> 03:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
it's 50 of the seventy percent it's
 
03:10:55.969 --> 03:10:55.979 align:start position:0%
fifty percent of the entire fund of the
 
03:10:58.550 --> 03:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the FI of the revenue that we receive
 
03:11:04.610 --> 03:11:04.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:04.620 --> 03:11:10.610 align:start position:0%
 
yep

03:11:10.610 --> 03:11:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:13.010 --> 03:11:13.020 align:start position:0%
how much is that
 
03:11:16.309 --> 03:11:16.319 align:start position:0%
currently it is I believe 18 million
 
03:11:19.070 --> 03:11:19.080 align:start position:0%
dollars our state treasurers here to to
 
03:11:20.750 --> 03:11:20.760 align:start position:0%
talk about those numbers but I believe
 
03:11:23.330 --> 03:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
it's 18 million uh it's it depends year
 
03:11:26.030 --> 03:11:26.040 align:start position:0%
to year based on market dynamics okay
 
03:11:29.210 --> 03:11:29.220 align:start position:0%
okay I have a question yeah um it's so
 
03:11:33.710 --> 03:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
it's 50 of the fund the 529 fund and so
 
03:11:36.710 --> 03:11:36.720 align:start position:0%
would there still be 30 that goes to how
 
03:11:38.450 --> 03:11:38.460 align:start position:0%
because right now there's a 70 30
 
03:11:38.460 --> 03:11:39.469 align:start position:0%
because right now there's a 70 30
percent

03:11:39.469 --> 03:11:39.479 align:start position:0%
percent
 
03:11:39.479 --> 03:11:40.849 align:start position:0%
percent
mix

03:11:40.849 --> 03:11:40.859 align:start position:0%
mix
 
03:11:42.530 --> 03:11:42.540 align:start position:0%
what's that going to look like if this
 
03:11:44.929 --> 03:11:44.939 align:start position:0%
if we go this route correct it will be
 
03:11:49.070 --> 03:11:49.080 align:start position:0%
at least 50 percent to the student loans
 
03:11:52.490 --> 03:11:52.500 align:start position:0%
um up to 10 to the endowments and the
 
03:11:54.050 --> 03:11:54.060 align:start position:0%
rest to
 
03:11:54.060 --> 03:11:54.710 align:start position:0%
rest to
um

03:11:54.710 --> 03:11:54.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:57.889 --> 03:11:57.899 align:start position:0%
to the direct scholarship so up to 50 if
 
03:11:59.630 --> 03:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
if none goes to the endowments up to 50
 
03:12:02.929 --> 03:12:02.939 align:start position:0%
to scholarships
 
03:12:04.490 --> 03:12:04.500 align:start position:0%
and that's the current scholarship
 
03:12:07.670 --> 03:12:07.680 align:start position:0%
correct uh the other thing can you uh
 
03:12:09.110 --> 03:12:09.120 align:start position:0%
just limb out a little bit what medical
 
03:12:12.110 --> 03:12:12.120 align:start position:0%
Fields you're talking about the way so
 
03:12:14.150 --> 03:12:14.160 align:start position:0%
the way it's structured
 
03:12:16.790 --> 03:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
um we we have medical professionals and
 
03:12:20.269 --> 03:12:20.279 align:start position:0%
I we are going to work with the Bia
 
03:12:23.510 --> 03:12:23.520 align:start position:0%
should this pass to Define that further
 
03:12:26.150 --> 03:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
but as it's structured right now it says
 
03:12:29.150 --> 03:12:29.160 align:start position:0%
medical professionals in the bill
 
03:12:30.950 --> 03:12:30.960 align:start position:0%
um I'm looking at the difference
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
if someone goes to Dartmouth medical and
 
03:12:34.969 --> 03:12:34.979 align:start position:0%
becomes a doctor are they part of this
 
03:12:37.190 --> 03:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
program and their medical fees are
 
03:12:38.990 --> 03:12:39.000 align:start position:0%
forgiven after three years if they work
 
03:12:41.570 --> 03:12:41.580 align:start position:0%
at Catholic medical or something or this
 
03:12:43.190 --> 03:12:43.200 align:start position:0%
more directed because that that's a
 
03:12:45.530 --> 03:12:45.540 align:start position:0%
rather larger chunk of change than if
 
03:12:47.450 --> 03:12:47.460 align:start position:0%
you're dealing with uh nursing
 
03:12:52.010 --> 03:12:52.020 align:start position:0%
staff it would be applicable to to uh
 
03:12:53.570 --> 03:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
nursing staffing it could be applicable
 
03:12:56.330 --> 03:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
to to folks that if they go to Dartmouth
 
03:12:58.309 --> 03:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
could be applicable as long as they're
 
03:12:59.929 --> 03:12:59.939 align:start position:0%
qualifying under the program and they
 
03:13:01.130 --> 03:13:01.140 align:start position:0%
work here in the state for at least
 
03:13:02.210 --> 03:13:02.220 align:start position:0%
three years
 
03:13:03.590 --> 03:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
so it would be applicable to a medical
 
03:13:03.600 --> 03:13:05.510 align:start position:0%
so it would be applicable to a medical
doctor

03:13:05.510 --> 03:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
doctor
 
03:13:08.570 --> 03:13:08.580 align:start position:0%
under the under the legislation yes I'm
 
03:13:12.590 --> 03:13:12.600 align:start position:0%
going to defer uh how how the BFA would
 
03:13:14.269 --> 03:13:14.279 align:start position:0%
like to structure that
 
03:13:19.670 --> 03:13:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:22.610 --> 03:13:22.620 align:start position:0%
and and this could apply for
 
03:13:25.610 --> 03:13:25.620 align:start position:0%
student graduates that come to New
 
03:13:25.620 --> 03:13:26.450 align:start position:0%
student graduates that come to New
Hampshire

03:13:26.450 --> 03:13:26.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
03:13:28.610 --> 03:13:28.620 align:start position:0%
the same not just New Hampshire
 
03:13:28.620 --> 03:13:30.230 align:start position:0%
the same not just New Hampshire
residents

03:13:30.230 --> 03:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
residents
 
03:13:32.750 --> 03:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
that's correct yes if they if a person
 
03:13:35.150 --> 03:13:35.160 align:start position:0%
comes to New Hampshire and works in the
 
03:13:37.190 --> 03:13:37.200 align:start position:0%
medical field in a medical field or any
 
03:13:38.630 --> 03:13:38.640 align:start position:0%
of the qualifying fields for at least
 
03:13:41.030 --> 03:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
three years then they would be eligible
 
03:13:42.590 --> 03:13:42.600 align:start position:0%
for this okay
 
03:13:45.410 --> 03:13:45.420 align:start position:0%
question is Army one of the primary
 
03:13:49.309 --> 03:13:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:49.319 --> 03:13:50.750 align:start position:0%
 
who

03:13:50.750 --> 03:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:13:50.760 --> 03:13:52.910 align:start position:0%
who
Army

03:13:52.910 --> 03:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
Army
 
03:13:55.849 --> 03:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
um would they be a recipient of this
 
03:13:55.859 --> 03:13:57.050 align:start position:0%
um would they be a recipient of this
uh

03:13:57.050 --> 03:13:57.060 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:13:58.670 --> 03:13:58.680 align:start position:0%
I'd have to talk I would have to defer
 
03:14:00.410 --> 03:14:00.420 align:start position:0%
that question to the to the BFA okay
 
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:07.070 --> 03:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
right thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
03:14:09.650 --> 03:14:09.660 align:start position:0%
being here uh do you advertise this out
 
03:14:12.410 --> 03:14:12.420 align:start position:0%
of state uh to attract uh young people I
 
03:14:15.469 --> 03:14:15.479 align:start position:0%
mean do we have a budget for that
 
03:14:17.929 --> 03:14:17.939 align:start position:0%
so the BFA would be administering the
 
03:14:17.939 --> 03:14:19.309 align:start position:0%
so the BFA would be administering the
program

03:14:19.309 --> 03:14:19.319 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:14:22.190 --> 03:14:22.200 align:start position:0%
um I this I don't think this uh
 
03:14:24.590 --> 03:14:24.600 align:start position:0%
contemplates a budget to advertise the
 
03:14:24.600 --> 03:14:25.670 align:start position:0%
contemplates a budget to advertise the
program

03:14:25.670 --> 03:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:14:27.889 --> 03:14:27.899 align:start position:0%
um but but it would be available to
 
03:14:30.290 --> 03:14:30.300 align:start position:0%
anybody who wants to to take advantage
 
03:14:32.630 --> 03:14:32.640 align:start position:0%
of it and it's qualifying under the
 
03:14:35.630 --> 03:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
under the bill right if but they'd have
 
03:14:37.550 --> 03:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
to know that it's available I mean you
 
03:14:39.830 --> 03:14:39.840 align:start position:0%
know this is like like Snoop advertisers
 
03:14:41.630 --> 03:14:41.640 align:start position:0%
across the country I mean it they get
 
03:14:44.630 --> 03:14:44.640 align:start position:0%
very good exposure I mean we we need we
 
03:14:46.730 --> 03:14:46.740 align:start position:0%
need people I mean it's especially
 
03:14:49.309 --> 03:14:49.319 align:start position:0%
qualified people it'd be uh be great if
 
03:14:51.710 --> 03:14:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:54.590 --> 03:14:54.600 align:start position:0%
I I will leave that to the committee to
 
03:14:57.530 --> 03:14:57.540 align:start position:0%
decide uh that there's no funding in the
 
03:15:00.230 --> 03:15:00.240 align:start position:0%
bill currently to advertise it but
 
03:15:02.030 --> 03:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
um I I would defer to the committee on
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
on whether they would like whether you
 
03:15:05.929 --> 03:15:05.939 align:start position:0%
would like to add funding for that
 
03:15:08.570 --> 03:15:08.580 align:start position:0%
should you pass it
 
03:15:11.330 --> 03:15:11.340 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:15:15.650 --> 03:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
okay whatever you got next thank you uh
 
03:15:19.670 --> 03:15:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:21.710 --> 03:15:21.720 align:start position:0%
would be possible though to hear from
 
03:15:23.630 --> 03:15:23.640 align:start position:0%
the treasurer first to give us a better
 
03:15:26.330 --> 03:15:26.340 align:start position:0%
context about what this program is where
 
03:15:28.309 --> 03:15:28.319 align:start position:0%
the money comes from
 
03:15:30.469 --> 03:15:30.479 align:start position:0%
if you don't mind are you comfortable
 
03:15:35.990 --> 03:15:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:36.000 --> 03:15:56.210 align:start position:0%
 
certainly

03:15:56.210 --> 03:15:56.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:58.010 --> 03:15:58.020 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair member so the
 
03:15:59.690 --> 03:15:59.700 align:start position:0%
committee for the record State Treasurer
 
03:16:06.830 --> 03:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:08.870 --> 03:16:08.880 align:start position:0%
so I just prepare a little handouts so
 
03:16:10.790 --> 03:16:10.800 align:start position:0%
you can keep in case I forget to say
 
03:16:12.530 --> 03:16:12.540 align:start position:0%
something but if they're just basic
 
03:16:14.210 --> 03:16:14.220 align:start position:0%
things that perhaps you want to consider
 
03:16:16.550 --> 03:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
as you consider this proposal but I'm
 
03:16:18.349 --> 03:16:18.359 align:start position:0%
just going to go over that if if that's
 
03:16:20.389 --> 03:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
okay with you in that we give you a
 
03:16:21.950 --> 03:16:21.960 align:start position:0%
higher higher level overview of what
 
03:16:25.730 --> 03:16:25.740 align:start position:0%
what are the current program is so
 
03:16:28.790 --> 03:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
um so as you all know we have um our
 
03:16:31.670 --> 03:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
fighting program that New Hampshire has
 
03:16:35.090 --> 03:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
um a very successful program where the
 
03:16:37.849 --> 03:16:37.859 align:start position:0%
fourth largest in the country and
 
03:16:40.969 --> 03:16:40.979 align:start position:0%
um that the college tuition savings and
 
03:16:42.769 --> 03:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
I guess I'll back up for a moment this
 
03:16:44.870 --> 03:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
literature takes no position and on on
 
03:16:47.030 --> 03:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
this proposal so I'm just happy to
 
03:16:48.590 --> 03:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
provide any information you would like
 
03:16:49.790 --> 03:16:49.800 align:start position:0%
to hear
 
03:16:51.650 --> 03:16:51.660 align:start position:0%
um so the second ball I just wanted to
 
03:16:53.929 --> 03:16:53.939 align:start position:0%
mention that um the college tuition
 
03:16:56.990 --> 03:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
Summit plan advisor commission is the is
 
03:16:59.090 --> 03:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
a commission that has the oversight of
 
03:17:02.330 --> 03:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
the plan itself and three scholarship
 
03:17:04.550 --> 03:17:04.560 align:start position:0%
programs so we've been talking right now
 
03:17:07.070 --> 03:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
about two scholarship programs that were
 
03:17:10.610 --> 03:17:10.620 align:start position:0%
initially established with
 
03:17:13.010 --> 03:17:13.020 align:start position:0%
um is an administrative as an
 
03:17:14.929 --> 03:17:14.939 align:start position:0%
administrative assessment that is
 
03:17:17.769 --> 03:17:17.779 align:start position:0%
charged to all fightmen and participants
 
03:17:20.809 --> 03:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
that have accounts with the New
 
03:17:23.570 --> 03:17:23.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire plan and so that charge is is
 
03:17:25.969 --> 03:17:25.979 align:start position:0%
the money that we collect
 
03:17:29.570 --> 03:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
um and we in the in the law RSA 630a
 
03:17:32.150 --> 03:17:32.160 align:start position:0%
establishes the New Hampshire excellence
 
03:17:34.550 --> 03:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
and higher education trust fund and the
 
03:17:37.130 --> 03:17:37.140 align:start position:0%
money that we collect is credited to the
 
03:17:40.370 --> 03:17:40.380 align:start position:0%
fund the law also says that this money
 
03:17:43.370 --> 03:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
that is collected is to be used for two
 
03:17:45.050 --> 03:17:45.060 align:start position:0%
Scholars for scholarship and
 
03:17:48.050 --> 03:17:48.060 align:start position:0%
Scholarships in general to assist New
 
03:17:50.450 --> 03:17:50.460 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents while attending New
 
03:17:52.130 --> 03:17:52.140 align:start position:0%
Hampshire institutions so it's it's
 
03:17:54.230 --> 03:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
currently the scholarship programs are
 
03:17:56.990 --> 03:17:57.000 align:start position:0%
meant for New Hampshire residents who
 
03:17:59.570 --> 03:17:59.580 align:start position:0%
attend New Hampshire institutions
 
03:18:02.809 --> 03:18:02.819 align:start position:0%
so the two score so so the law allows to
 
03:18:04.550 --> 03:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
do that and then
 
03:18:06.349 --> 03:18:06.359 align:start position:0%
um the commission has an insert rules
 
03:18:09.650 --> 03:18:09.660 align:start position:0%
where two scholarship programs are are
 
03:18:13.670 --> 03:18:13.680 align:start position:0%
defined and and rules one is called the
 
03:18:16.130 --> 03:18:16.140 align:start position:0%
unique endowment allocation program and
 
03:18:18.710 --> 03:18:18.720 align:start position:0%
the other one is called unique annual
 
03:18:21.110 --> 03:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
allocation program the annual location
 
03:18:24.110 --> 03:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
program provides direct scholarships to
 
03:18:26.269 --> 03:18:26.279 align:start position:0%
students and that's something
 
03:18:29.870 --> 03:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
um the treasury provides money to the to
 
03:18:31.429 --> 03:18:31.439 align:start position:0%
the institutions and then institutions
 
03:18:34.309 --> 03:18:34.319 align:start position:0%
go and find students that are eligible
 
03:18:36.710 --> 03:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
for those scholarships the second
 
03:18:38.630 --> 03:18:38.640 align:start position:0%
program the endowment allocation program
 
03:18:41.630 --> 03:18:41.640 align:start position:0%
are essentially monthly grants or
 
03:18:44.389 --> 03:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
allocations given to
 
03:18:46.429 --> 03:18:46.439 align:start position:0%
um endowments established by these
 
03:18:48.590 --> 03:18:48.600 align:start position:0%
institutions their restricted endowments
 
03:18:51.830 --> 03:18:51.840 align:start position:0%
for this purpose only and the reason for
 
03:18:54.230 --> 03:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
that program was to create
 
03:18:56.150 --> 03:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
um that institutions will maintain an
 
03:18:57.950 --> 03:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
endowment and they will they will
 
03:19:00.769 --> 03:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
provide scholarships and perpetuity so
 
03:19:02.990 --> 03:19:03.000 align:start position:0%
there are sort of two two two
 
03:19:05.990 --> 03:19:06.000 align:start position:0%
um two-way supervised scholarships
 
03:19:08.870 --> 03:19:08.880 align:start position:0%
um so over the over the years uh in the
 
03:19:11.510 --> 03:19:11.520 align:start position:0%
past the rule had indicated that eighty
 
03:19:13.130 --> 03:19:13.140 align:start position:0%
percent of the money collected was going
 
03:19:14.750 --> 03:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
to go to the endowments because the
 
03:19:16.429 --> 03:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
purpose I believe the commission wanted
 
03:19:19.250 --> 03:19:19.260 align:start position:0%
to grow those endowments in the past so
 
03:19:21.170 --> 03:19:21.180 align:start position:0%
they could just essentially one day be
 
03:19:25.030 --> 03:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
self-funded it was in 2000 it was in
 
03:19:28.190 --> 03:19:28.200 align:start position:0%
2021 when the commission and prior to
 
03:19:29.750 --> 03:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
that they started having discussions
 
03:19:29.760 --> 03:19:30.769 align:start position:0%
that they started having discussions
about

03:19:30.769 --> 03:19:30.779 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:19:33.170 --> 03:19:33.180 align:start position:0%
maybe not funding so much the endowment
 
03:19:36.349 --> 03:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
program but starting to provide more
 
03:19:38.150 --> 03:19:38.160 align:start position:0%
um have more money available for the
 
03:19:41.030 --> 03:19:41.040 align:start position:0%
annual or direct scholarships so since
 
03:19:44.150 --> 03:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
since so in 2021 the commission amended
 
03:19:47.389 --> 03:19:47.399 align:start position:0%
its rules to be able to expand the um
 
03:19:49.610 --> 03:19:49.620 align:start position:0%
the annual allocation program and to
 
03:19:53.450 --> 03:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
expand uh to provide greater a higher
 
03:19:55.969 --> 03:19:55.979 align:start position:0%
amount a war amount and also to increase
 
03:19:57.889 --> 03:19:57.899 align:start position:0%
the number of students who receive
 
03:20:00.110 --> 03:20:00.120 align:start position:0%
scholarships so that happened and with
 
03:20:02.510 --> 03:20:02.520 align:start position:0%
that changing the rules since then the
 
03:20:05.090 --> 03:20:05.100 align:start position:0%
commission has met and has been able to
 
03:20:07.730 --> 03:20:07.740 align:start position:0%
increase the awards every year so
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
essentially in fifth grade 23 is the
 
03:20:13.250 --> 03:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
first year that the because of the
 
03:20:15.530 --> 03:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
change in the rules the commission was
 
03:20:17.389 --> 03:20:17.399 align:start position:0%
able to provide scholarships so just to
 
03:20:19.490 --> 03:20:19.500 align:start position:0%
give you a little context and and this
 
03:20:22.130 --> 03:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
is actually I'm in my last second to
 
03:20:25.330 --> 03:20:25.340 align:start position:0%
last bullet and so fiscal year 23
 
03:20:29.809 --> 03:20:29.819 align:start position:0%
we anticipated about 6400 students will
 
03:20:32.090 --> 03:20:32.100 align:start position:0%
receive a unique end of the war and
 
03:20:34.849 --> 03:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
right now it's a 1300 award and that
 
03:20:37.010 --> 03:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
goes for a full-time student and is pro
 
03:20:39.290 --> 03:20:39.300 align:start position:0%
rated for a part-time student
 
03:20:41.269 --> 03:20:41.279 align:start position:0%
so the total cost right now that we
 
03:20:43.610 --> 03:20:43.620 align:start position:0%
expect for fiscal year 33 is about 14
 
03:20:45.590 --> 03:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars
 
03:20:47.750 --> 03:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
um we're yet to see the total cost the
 
03:20:49.429 --> 03:20:49.439 align:start position:0%
schools report to us at the end of the
 
03:20:51.950 --> 03:20:51.960 align:start position:0%
school year for that and then um the
 
03:20:53.690 --> 03:20:53.700 align:start position:0%
commission already made projections and
 
03:20:56.090 --> 03:20:56.100 align:start position:0%
decided the eligibility criteria for
 
03:21:00.050 --> 03:21:00.060 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 24 and so with um so again
 
03:21:02.389 --> 03:21:02.399 align:start position:0%
seeing that perhaps they wanted to
 
03:21:04.490 --> 03:21:04.500 align:start position:0%
increase the award amount the commission
 
03:21:06.769 --> 03:21:06.779 align:start position:0%
decided to increase the world amount to
 
03:21:10.130 --> 03:21:10.140 align:start position:0%
fifteen hundred dollars per student and
 
03:21:12.950 --> 03:21:12.960 align:start position:0%
um and again to provide more Awards so
 
03:21:14.630 --> 03:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
so the schools
 
03:21:17.090 --> 03:21:17.100 align:start position:0%
um also the eligibility criteria was
 
03:21:19.309 --> 03:21:19.319 align:start position:0%
expanded to to have students who have a
 
03:21:21.889 --> 03:21:21.899 align:start position:0%
higher expected family contribution
 
03:21:24.469 --> 03:21:24.479 align:start position:0%
amount so with that we expected about
 
03:21:27.349 --> 03:21:27.359 align:start position:0%
over 10 000 students will be will
 
03:21:29.630 --> 03:21:29.640 align:start position:0%
benefit from this change and the
 
03:21:31.429 --> 03:21:31.439 align:start position:0%
projected cost is about 70 million
 
03:21:33.590 --> 03:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
dollars this is a very rough number this
 
03:21:36.950 --> 03:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
adjusts projections is we're not sure if
 
03:21:38.210 --> 03:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
that's going to be what's going to be
 
03:21:39.830 --> 03:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
needed but as of right now now that's
 
03:21:42.349 --> 03:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
what we know and it's based on data that
 
03:21:44.990 --> 03:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
all the colleges and universities have
 
03:21:48.050 --> 03:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
provided to us so that's sort of the
 
03:21:50.269 --> 03:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
over you know on overview I wanted to
 
03:21:51.650 --> 03:21:51.660 align:start position:0%
share with you I'll be happy to answer
 
03:21:53.510 --> 03:21:53.520 align:start position:0%
any questions you have
 
03:21:53.520 --> 03:21:57.769 align:start position:0%
any questions you have
questions

03:21:57.769 --> 03:21:57.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:01.490 --> 03:22:01.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:03.469 --> 03:22:03.479 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:22:05.570 --> 03:22:05.580 align:start position:0%
taking the questions
 
03:22:08.210 --> 03:22:08.220 align:start position:0%
um a couple of questions actually uh
 
03:22:08.220 --> 03:22:09.410 align:start position:0%
um a couple of questions actually uh
first

03:22:09.410 --> 03:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
first
 
03:22:13.370 --> 03:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
this is funded by uh fees based on 529
 
03:22:16.010 --> 03:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
plans what percentage of the money we
 
03:22:18.290 --> 03:22:18.300 align:start position:0%
currently hold in New Hampshire 529
 
03:22:20.269 --> 03:22:20.279 align:start position:0%
plans is held on behalf of New Hampshire
 
03:22:22.610 --> 03:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
residents versus out-of-state
 
03:22:25.670 --> 03:22:25.680 align:start position:0%
participants that may find a 529 to be a
 
03:22:27.710 --> 03:22:27.720 align:start position:0%
good program
 
03:22:30.530 --> 03:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
our 529 to be a better program than
 
03:22:32.330 --> 03:22:32.340 align:start position:0%
their states sure thank you for the
 
03:22:34.910 --> 03:22:34.920 align:start position:0%
question so the plan itself we have
 
03:22:37.670 --> 03:22:37.680 align:start position:0%
about 21 billion dollars under uh assets
 
03:22:39.769 --> 03:22:39.779 align:start position:0%
under management so right now New
 
03:22:42.650 --> 03:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is the fourth largest uh uh
 
03:22:45.170 --> 03:22:45.180 align:start position:0%
plan and the country and the reason for
 
03:22:45.180 --> 03:22:46.010 align:start position:0%
plan and the country and the reason for
that

03:22:46.010 --> 03:22:46.020 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:22:48.469 --> 03:22:48.479 align:start position:0%
um is because New Hampshire was one of
 
03:22:51.530 --> 03:22:51.540 align:start position:0%
the first ones that launched the phyton
 
03:22:54.170 --> 03:22:54.180 align:start position:0%
plan the college Savings Plan and the
 
03:22:56.630 --> 03:22:56.640 align:start position:0%
country So that obviously allowed to
 
03:22:59.510 --> 03:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
gain market share right away and and
 
03:23:01.849 --> 03:23:01.859 align:start position:0%
since the very beginning uh Fidelity
 
03:23:04.370 --> 03:23:04.380 align:start position:0%
Investments was um has been the program
 
03:23:06.769 --> 03:23:06.779 align:start position:0%
manager for that one of the key key
 
03:23:10.070 --> 03:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
characteristics of this partnership is
 
03:23:12.050 --> 03:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
where New Hampshire negotiated with
 
03:23:13.910 --> 03:23:13.920 align:start position:0%
Fidelity and
 
03:23:16.090 --> 03:23:16.100 align:start position:0%
um New Hampshire is
 
03:23:19.570 --> 03:23:19.580 align:start position:0%
based on a contractual obligation
 
03:23:22.010 --> 03:23:22.020 align:start position:0%
Fidelity has a responsibility to market
 
03:23:25.010 --> 03:23:25.020 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire plan first
 
03:23:26.870 --> 03:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
even though they have relationships with
 
03:23:28.550 --> 03:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
other states so foreign for example they
 
03:23:29.510 --> 03:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
have relationships with Massachusetts
 
03:23:32.630 --> 03:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
Delaware Connecticut Arizona but if
 
03:23:34.910 --> 03:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
someone from California wants an account
 
03:23:37.130 --> 03:23:37.140 align:start position:0%
with Fidelity Fidelity has the
 
03:23:39.410 --> 03:23:39.420 align:start position:0%
obligation to say we have a unique
 
03:23:41.990 --> 03:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
account for you in as an account for New
 
03:23:44.630 --> 03:23:44.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so they that's why New
 
03:23:47.690 --> 03:23:47.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a lot more accounts that
 
03:23:49.969 --> 03:23:49.979 align:start position:0%
come from out of state uh participants
 
03:23:52.670 --> 03:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
so I think part of your question was
 
03:23:54.830 --> 03:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
about a split between in-state
 
03:23:57.229 --> 03:23:57.239 align:start position:0%
out-of-state money just total ballpark
 
03:24:00.170 --> 03:24:00.180 align:start position:0%
so because of the population so through
 
03:24:04.130 --> 03:24:04.140 align:start position:0%
about three percent of the plan money
 
03:24:06.910 --> 03:24:06.920 align:start position:0%
even and participants
 
03:24:09.530 --> 03:24:09.540 align:start position:0%
relates to New Hampshire's New Hampshire
 
03:24:09.540 --> 03:24:11.150 align:start position:0%
relates to New Hampshire's New Hampshire
residents

03:24:11.150 --> 03:24:11.160 align:start position:0%
residents
 
03:24:12.710 --> 03:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
um and it's again it's due to
 
03:24:15.170 --> 03:24:15.180 align:start position:0%
populations so we have the majority of
 
03:24:16.910 --> 03:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
the count holders are from California
 
03:24:20.870 --> 03:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
Texas and again it has to do with
 
03:24:22.370 --> 03:24:22.380 align:start position:0%
population and it's been pretty
 
03:24:22.380 --> 03:24:24.050 align:start position:0%
population and it's been pretty
consistent

03:24:24.050 --> 03:24:24.060 align:start position:0%
consistent
 
03:24:26.510 --> 03:24:26.520 align:start position:0%
um over the years thank you I would say
 
03:24:28.309 --> 03:24:28.319 align:start position:0%
that probably the fact that we are you
 
03:24:30.530 --> 03:24:30.540 align:start position:0%
know no income tax state has a lot to do
 
03:24:32.090 --> 03:24:32.100 align:start position:0%
with that too because they don't have to
 
03:24:33.530 --> 03:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
worry that if they move you know this
 
03:24:35.870 --> 03:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
would be taxable under other situations
 
03:24:38.330 --> 03:24:38.340 align:start position:0%
but I do appreciate the background I I
 
03:24:40.910 --> 03:24:40.920 align:start position:0%
really needed it and the other question
 
03:24:43.969 --> 03:24:43.979 align:start position:0%
I had you were referring to the expected
 
03:24:46.250 --> 03:24:46.260 align:start position:0%
family contribution or Mountain as one
 
03:24:48.170 --> 03:24:48.180 align:start position:0%
of the criteria used in determining
 
03:24:50.750 --> 03:24:50.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility for direct scholarships I do
 
03:24:54.110 --> 03:24:54.120 align:start position:0%
remember horror stories from the uh you
 
03:24:56.210 --> 03:24:56.220 align:start position:0%
know FAFSA application where college
 
03:25:00.349 --> 03:25:00.359 align:start position:0%
students with a parent that was divorced
 
03:25:01.729 --> 03:25:01.739 align:start position:0%
and refused to support them were
 
03:25:04.130 --> 03:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
ineligible for the loans because the
 
03:25:06.170 --> 03:25:06.180 align:start position:0%
federal government consider that to be
 
03:25:08.450 --> 03:25:08.460 align:start position:0%
available income even though the parents
 
03:25:10.190 --> 03:25:10.200 align:start position:0%
were estranged and not providing any
 
03:25:12.410 --> 03:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
support are you familiar with whether
 
03:25:14.330 --> 03:25:14.340 align:start position:0%
those types of rules are also applied
 
03:25:16.190 --> 03:25:16.200 align:start position:0%
the same way to New Hampshire residents
 
03:25:18.469 --> 03:25:18.479 align:start position:0%
or so when we calculate that do we
 
03:25:20.809 --> 03:25:20.819 align:start position:0%
account for those types of situations
 
03:25:23.150 --> 03:25:23.160 align:start position:0%
were on paper there is a parent who has
 
03:25:25.429 --> 03:25:25.439 align:start position:0%
the resources but because of a divorce
 
03:25:27.830 --> 03:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
and all that there was no intent to pay
 
03:25:30.830 --> 03:25:30.840 align:start position:0%
I'm just curious whether we
 
03:25:33.410 --> 03:25:33.420 align:start position:0%
in terms of the eligibility criteria
 
03:25:35.630 --> 03:25:35.640 align:start position:0%
um the the commission has the ability to
 
03:25:38.090 --> 03:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
set certain
 
03:25:40.809 --> 03:25:40.819 align:start position:0%
um certain components of that criteria
 
03:25:43.370 --> 03:25:43.380 align:start position:0%
the rest is all established in the rules
 
03:25:47.030 --> 03:25:47.040 align:start position:0%
so the rules um allow so so so one of
 
03:25:48.950 --> 03:25:48.960 align:start position:0%
the I guess I'll go back to the criteria
 
03:25:50.990 --> 03:25:51.000 align:start position:0%
what the commission decides every year
 
03:25:53.630 --> 03:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
is essentially the amount that will be a
 
03:25:57.530 --> 03:25:57.540 align:start position:0%
that will be allocated for every
 
03:25:59.330 --> 03:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
Academic Year right the total amount
 
03:26:01.309 --> 03:26:01.319 align:start position:0%
that we will be able to provide to
 
03:26:03.650 --> 03:26:03.660 align:start position:0%
students the other component is the
 
03:26:06.170 --> 03:26:06.180 align:start position:0%
expected family contribution the award
 
03:26:06.180 --> 03:26:07.610 align:start position:0%
expected family contribution the award
amount

03:26:07.610 --> 03:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
amount
 
03:26:10.190 --> 03:26:10.200 align:start position:0%
um the the date of when the FAFSA
 
03:26:13.550 --> 03:26:13.560 align:start position:0%
deadline the FAFSA can be filed and I
 
03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
guess all of that affects you know how
 
03:26:18.170 --> 03:26:18.180 align:start position:0%
many students are
 
03:26:22.490 --> 03:26:22.500 align:start position:0%
will become a part of the pool of
 
03:26:24.849 --> 03:26:24.859 align:start position:0%
eligible students
 
03:26:29.150 --> 03:26:29.160 align:start position:0%
I don't believe where you so so so I
 
03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
guess try to answer your question that's
 
03:26:34.849 --> 03:26:34.859 align:start position:0%
what the commission decides the treasury
 
03:26:37.610 --> 03:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
um what we do is provide the funding to
 
03:26:39.889 --> 03:26:39.899 align:start position:0%
the institutions and they're the ones
 
03:26:42.650 --> 03:26:42.660 align:start position:0%
that follow the rules and they're the
 
03:26:45.769 --> 03:26:45.779 align:start position:0%
ones that include the funding as part of
 
03:26:48.950 --> 03:26:48.960 align:start position:0%
the financial aid packaging so
 
03:26:51.469 --> 03:26:51.479 align:start position:0%
um so I'm not as familiar with the
 
03:26:54.590 --> 03:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
financial financial aid components but
 
03:26:57.229 --> 03:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
um that doesn't sound familiar thank you
 
03:26:59.510 --> 03:26:59.520 align:start position:0%
so much I appreciate it
 
03:27:01.309 --> 03:27:01.319 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
03:27:02.809 --> 03:27:02.819 align:start position:0%
being here
 
03:27:05.630 --> 03:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
um this you have was there an RFP for
 
03:27:07.849 --> 03:27:07.859 align:start position:0%
hiring Fidelity and how long is that
 
03:27:10.849 --> 03:27:10.859 align:start position:0%
contract good for if there is
 
03:27:13.490 --> 03:27:13.500 align:start position:0%
um so initially there was an RFP with
 
03:27:17.210 --> 03:27:17.220 align:start position:0%
Fidelity and there was um that contract
 
03:27:20.450 --> 03:27:20.460 align:start position:0%
I believe was for 15 years then it was
 
03:27:22.849 --> 03:27:22.859 align:start position:0%
renewed for another I'm going to say 10
 
03:27:27.050 --> 03:27:27.060 align:start position:0%
years it was in 2017 when
 
03:27:30.530 --> 03:27:30.540 align:start position:0%
um it was time again to consider the RFP
 
03:27:33.050 --> 03:27:33.060 align:start position:0%
decision and
 
03:27:36.170 --> 03:27:36.180 align:start position:0%
um at the time so the control allows for
 
03:27:39.530 --> 03:27:39.540 align:start position:0%
five year own renewals continues five
 
03:27:41.630 --> 03:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
every now and at the time the commission
 
03:27:44.389 --> 03:27:44.399 align:start position:0%
decided to renew for five years the
 
03:27:46.190 --> 03:27:46.200 align:start position:0%
commission just made the same decision
 
03:27:48.349 --> 03:27:48.359 align:start position:0%
it was we we had the commission had a
 
03:27:50.030 --> 03:27:50.040 align:start position:0%
meeting to
 
03:27:52.130 --> 03:27:52.140 align:start position:0%
um decide whether an RFP was going to be
 
03:27:54.650 --> 03:27:54.660 align:start position:0%
issued or to to or if they were going to
 
03:27:57.050 --> 03:27:57.060 align:start position:0%
exercise a five-year renewal
 
03:27:58.790 --> 03:27:58.800 align:start position:0%
um the commission came to the conclusion
 
03:28:01.490 --> 03:28:01.500 align:start position:0%
that a five-year no was more appropriate
 
03:28:03.469 --> 03:28:03.479 align:start position:0%
this time around and that went to
 
03:28:05.030 --> 03:28:05.040 align:start position:0%
Governor Council they got approved so
 
03:28:07.670 --> 03:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
now the contract has been extended for
 
03:28:09.769 --> 03:28:09.779 align:start position:0%
those five years it will expire I
 
03:28:12.650 --> 03:28:12.660 align:start position:0%
believe in 2020 a
 
03:28:14.269 --> 03:28:14.279 align:start position:0%
it seems to me if they're out there
 
03:28:16.790 --> 03:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
selling plans in other states and
 
03:28:19.330 --> 03:28:19.340 align:start position:0%
putting in our Treasury
 
03:28:23.389 --> 03:28:23.399 align:start position:0%
to our benefit I should say why leave I
 
03:28:24.830 --> 03:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
mean you're not going to get a
 
03:28:28.309 --> 03:28:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:32.210 --> 03:28:32.220 align:start position:0%
you hope it's locked in yeah other
 
03:28:32.220 --> 03:28:33.349 align:start position:0%
you hope it's locked in yeah other
questions

03:28:33.349 --> 03:28:33.359 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:28:35.570 --> 03:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
yes just thank you this has been a
 
03:28:38.450 --> 03:28:38.460 align:start position:0%
fabulous program for our students and I
 
03:28:40.670 --> 03:28:40.680 align:start position:0%
just think it was actually what a
 
03:28:42.410 --> 03:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
brilliant idea of somebody whoever
 
03:28:43.670 --> 03:28:43.680 align:start position:0%
developed it
 
03:28:45.469 --> 03:28:45.479 align:start position:0%
um has worked well
 
03:28:48.050 --> 03:28:48.060 align:start position:0%
well she did a wonderful thing
 
03:28:49.550 --> 03:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:28:52.250 --> 03:28:52.260 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about another much
 
03:28:55.550 --> 03:28:55.560 align:start position:0%
needed program too but my concern is
 
03:28:57.530 --> 03:28:57.540 align:start position:0%
what this would do how would it reduce
 
03:28:58.929 --> 03:28:58.939 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
03:29:01.429 --> 03:29:01.439 align:start position:0%
scholarship Awards to our New Hampshire
 
03:29:03.950 --> 03:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
uh students
 
03:29:05.929 --> 03:29:05.939 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so with the
 
03:29:08.630 --> 03:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
funding me introduced to have
 
03:29:10.969 --> 03:29:10.979 align:start position:0%
um and then the commission has so so
 
03:29:14.030 --> 03:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
again the the funding that we receive is
 
03:29:16.010 --> 03:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
really based on the value of the
 
03:29:18.889 --> 03:29:18.899 align:start position:0%
portfolio right the trust so with the
 
03:29:20.630 --> 03:29:20.640 align:start position:0%
market expectations and those
 
03:29:23.510 --> 03:29:23.520 align:start position:0%
projections have been lower a bit and
 
03:29:24.830 --> 03:29:24.840 align:start position:0%
and so right now we're projected to
 
03:29:26.990 --> 03:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
receive about 17 million and we just got
 
03:29:28.969 --> 03:29:28.979 align:start position:0%
the most recent projections from
 
03:29:31.309 --> 03:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
Fidelity so assuming that we get 70
 
03:29:34.190 --> 03:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
million dollars for each fiscal year
 
03:29:37.790 --> 03:29:37.800 align:start position:0%
then we just have half that will be
 
03:29:40.130 --> 03:29:40.140 align:start position:0%
um four scholarships
 
03:29:42.349 --> 03:29:42.359 align:start position:0%
um with that half the commission has the
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
ability to decide how they will use
 
03:29:46.849 --> 03:29:46.859 align:start position:0%
those those funds whether they want to
 
03:29:49.130 --> 03:29:49.140 align:start position:0%
continue funding the endowment program
 
03:29:51.410 --> 03:29:51.420 align:start position:0%
or if they want to do what the new
 
03:29:54.110 --> 03:29:54.120 align:start position:0%
proposal says up to 10 and then the
 
03:29:56.210 --> 03:29:56.220 align:start position:0%
other one put the commission based on
 
03:29:58.610 --> 03:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
the rules has the ability to decide how
 
03:30:02.570 --> 03:30:02.580 align:start position:0%
much to send to both programs so
 
03:30:04.790 --> 03:30:04.800 align:start position:0%
um again it will be about
 
03:30:06.650 --> 03:30:06.660 align:start position:0%
um you know eight million dollars for
 
03:30:08.870 --> 03:30:08.880 align:start position:0%
the scholarship programs
 
03:30:12.950 --> 03:30:12.960 align:start position:0%
um perhaps you know um one of the poor
 
03:30:15.410 --> 03:30:15.420 align:start position:0%
Parts is that since the rules uh were
 
03:30:17.450 --> 03:30:17.460 align:start position:0%
changed we're just trying to see how the
 
03:30:19.670 --> 03:30:19.680 align:start position:0%
additional funding is allowing you know
 
03:30:22.130 --> 03:30:22.140 align:start position:0%
how many more students are being
 
03:30:24.170 --> 03:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
um will benefit from the you know from
 
03:30:26.870 --> 03:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
the changes the recent changes made so
 
03:30:28.790 --> 03:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
we have these projections but unable to
 
03:30:30.650 --> 03:30:30.660 align:start position:0%
really quantify
 
03:30:33.170 --> 03:30:33.180 align:start position:0%
um the exact change but um again
 
03:30:35.570 --> 03:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
assuming so for example I gave you the
 
03:30:38.630 --> 03:30:38.640 align:start position:0%
cost that is expected for uh fiscal year
 
03:30:43.070 --> 03:30:43.080 align:start position:0%
24. if those costs are true then
 
03:30:46.010 --> 03:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
um you know perhaps there will be a
 
03:30:48.229 --> 03:30:48.239 align:start position:0%
change will be required whether the
 
03:30:50.450 --> 03:30:50.460 align:start position:0%
Aurora man will have to go back from
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
1500 to 1300 or something less less
 
03:30:55.130 --> 03:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
students will be eligible because
 
03:30:58.190 --> 03:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
perhaps we have to adjust the EFC the
 
03:30:59.750 --> 03:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
expected family contribution so there
 
03:31:02.030 --> 03:31:02.040 align:start position:0%
are less students eligible so obviously
 
03:31:03.410 --> 03:31:03.420 align:start position:0%
some some changes will have to be made
 
03:31:05.570 --> 03:31:05.580 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up in terms of the
 
03:31:08.090 --> 03:31:08.100 align:start position:0%
commission the 529 commission
 
03:31:10.550 --> 03:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
um will The Proposal from the governor's
 
03:31:15.170 --> 03:31:15.180 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:17.389 --> 03:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
uh there are some there are some changes
 
03:31:20.690 --> 03:31:20.700 align:start position:0%
in the rule that they look like change
 
03:31:22.790 --> 03:31:22.800 align:start position:0%
I I don't think structurally it doesn't
 
03:31:25.130 --> 03:31:25.140 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it changes but but it
 
03:31:27.410 --> 03:31:27.420 align:start position:0%
but there are some changes in the in the
 
03:31:30.710 --> 03:31:30.720 align:start position:0%
proposal that um they're being mentioned
 
03:31:32.510 --> 03:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
um just the name and
 
03:31:35.750 --> 03:31:35.760 align:start position:0%
um there are some um
 
03:31:39.469 --> 03:31:39.479 align:start position:0%
um clarifications that this bill does
 
03:31:39.479 --> 03:31:40.550 align:start position:0%
um clarifications that this bill does
um

03:31:40.550 --> 03:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:41.809 --> 03:31:41.819 align:start position:0%
you know
 
03:31:44.090 --> 03:31:44.100 align:start position:0%
I will probably defer to the to the
 
03:31:46.010 --> 03:31:46.020 align:start position:0%
governor's office to really describe
 
03:31:49.250 --> 03:31:49.260 align:start position:0%
what those those really mean
 
03:31:49.260 --> 03:31:50.690 align:start position:0%
what those those really mean
okay

03:31:50.690 --> 03:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:31:54.490 --> 03:31:54.500 align:start position:0%
the uh speaker's appointment to this
 
03:31:57.889 --> 03:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
committee which the treasurer is in
 
03:32:00.530 --> 03:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
charge of as myself and Peter leishman
 
03:32:02.330 --> 03:32:02.340 align:start position:0%
we're meeting Monday
 
03:32:02.340 --> 03:32:04.190 align:start position:0%
we're meeting Monday
so

03:32:04.190 --> 03:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:32:06.830 --> 03:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
then I also talked with Kathy provencher
 
03:32:08.570 --> 03:32:08.580 align:start position:0%
you know we're going to look at these
 
03:32:11.269 --> 03:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
changes and we were never consulted no
 
03:32:13.969 --> 03:32:13.979 align:start position:0%
were you I don't believe
 
03:32:16.490 --> 03:32:16.500 align:start position:0%
I was uh I was I had just had
 
03:32:17.929 --> 03:32:17.939 align:start position:0%
conversations with the governor's office
 
03:32:17.939 --> 03:32:19.670 align:start position:0%
conversations with the governor's office
about

03:32:19.670 --> 03:32:19.680 align:start position:0%
about
 
03:32:21.769 --> 03:32:21.779 align:start position:0%
um you know providing information the
 
03:32:23.929 --> 03:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
current information that is is is is is
 
03:32:26.630 --> 03:32:26.640 align:start position:0%
exactly what I'm doing today so I will
 
03:32:28.849 --> 03:32:28.859 align:start position:0%
come back to the committee with comments
 
03:32:31.190 --> 03:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
that will hear she and I will hear at
 
03:32:33.830 --> 03:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
that meeting on Monday to see what they
 
03:32:36.170 --> 03:32:36.180 align:start position:0%
think of these changes and
 
03:32:38.990 --> 03:32:39.000 align:start position:0%
they may ask us to change it
 
03:32:41.690 --> 03:32:41.700 align:start position:0%
in which case Peter and I will be more
 
03:32:43.670 --> 03:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
than willing to see what what we can
 
03:32:45.410 --> 03:32:45.420 align:start position:0%
bring forward to that I'm not sure
 
03:32:47.929 --> 03:32:47.939 align:start position:0%
they'll be all accepted because if
 
03:32:49.550 --> 03:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
there's some thought that we're reducing
 
03:32:51.769 --> 03:32:51.779 align:start position:0%
the direct scholarships to New Hampshire
 
03:32:51.779 --> 03:32:53.330 align:start position:0%
the direct scholarships to New Hampshire
students

03:32:53.330 --> 03:32:53.340 align:start position:0%
students
 
03:32:56.150 --> 03:32:56.160 align:start position:0%
that may not be as as popular
 
03:32:58.370 --> 03:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
and I thought we already had a previous
 
03:33:01.610 --> 03:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
program to give to the people that were
 
03:33:03.830 --> 03:33:03.840 align:start position:0%
working in the Army I know we had a
 
03:33:06.469 --> 03:33:06.479 align:start position:0%
previous program some years ago and now
 
03:33:08.690 --> 03:33:08.700 align:start position:0%
people are being added to it as more
 
03:33:10.729 --> 03:33:10.739 align:start position:0%
people get added there's less money to
 
03:33:14.030 --> 03:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
go around so I'm not sure as as that
 
03:33:14.929 --> 03:33:14.939 align:start position:0%
will be
 
03:33:17.870 --> 03:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
something they will be willing to do so
 
03:33:20.330 --> 03:33:20.340 align:start position:0%
we will have that meeting on Monday she
 
03:33:22.729 --> 03:33:22.739 align:start position:0%
will be in charge of it and
 
03:33:25.010 --> 03:33:25.020 align:start position:0%
we will come back to you with with
 
03:33:27.349 --> 03:33:27.359 align:start position:0%
whatever the thoughts are when we bring
 
03:33:29.950 --> 03:33:29.960 align:start position:0%
those pages from the
 
03:33:29.960 --> 03:33:31.610 align:start position:0%
those pages from the
hb2

03:33:31.610 --> 03:33:31.620 align:start position:0%
hb2
 
03:33:34.490 --> 03:33:34.500 align:start position:0%
but anyway you will have a conduit thank
 
03:33:34.500 --> 03:33:36.830 align:start position:0%
but anyway you will have a conduit thank
you

03:33:36.830 --> 03:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:38.210 --> 03:33:38.220 align:start position:0%
other question
 
03:33:39.650 --> 03:33:39.660 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm just trying to work out my road
 
03:33:41.630 --> 03:33:41.640 align:start position:0%
map so last year
 
03:33:45.110 --> 03:33:45.120 align:start position:0%
um 14 million was given to uh the
 
03:33:46.490 --> 03:33:46.500 align:start position:0%
scholarship program
 
03:33:50.090 --> 03:33:50.100 align:start position:0%
this year the expectation of the the
 
03:33:52.370 --> 03:33:52.380 align:start position:0%
money that you'll have available is 17
 
03:33:52.380 --> 03:33:53.809 align:start position:0%
money that you'll have available is 17
million

03:33:53.809 --> 03:33:53.819 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:33:57.410 --> 03:33:57.420 align:start position:0%
and if 50 of that goes to this new
 
03:33:57.420 --> 03:33:58.490 align:start position:0%
and if 50 of that goes to this new
program

03:33:58.490 --> 03:33:58.500 align:start position:0%
program
 
03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
that would leave eight and a half
 
03:34:01.969 --> 03:34:01.979 align:start position:0%
million less than eight and a half
 
03:34:03.889 --> 03:34:03.899 align:start position:0%
million for the scholarship program
 
03:34:06.590 --> 03:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
which is close to half of what you gave
 
03:34:07.910 --> 03:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
away last year
 
03:34:10.190 --> 03:34:10.200 align:start position:0%
did I follow the dots there correctly
 
03:34:12.469 --> 03:34:12.479 align:start position:0%
yes but my understanding is a proposal
 
03:34:14.630 --> 03:34:14.640 align:start position:0%
of the effective date of The Proposal
 
03:34:16.790 --> 03:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
will be for fiscal year 25 so it doesn't
 
03:34:19.429 --> 03:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
appear that it won't will impact the
 
03:34:19.439 --> 03:34:20.450 align:start position:0%
appear that it won't will impact the
current

03:34:20.450 --> 03:34:20.460 align:start position:0%
current
 
03:34:22.990 --> 03:34:23.000 align:start position:0%
um what has been already
 
03:34:28.429 --> 03:34:28.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:31.910 --> 03:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:34:37.070 --> 03:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
just um that it will change the nature
 
03:34:40.610 --> 03:34:40.620 align:start position:0%
of the 529 program in permanence if we
 
03:34:42.170 --> 03:34:42.180 align:start position:0%
go this route
 
03:34:45.050 --> 03:34:45.060 align:start position:0%
the the nature of the scholarships yes
 
03:34:48.590 --> 03:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:04.250 --> 03:35:04.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:06.710 --> 03:35:06.720 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh for the record I'm
 
03:35:08.269 --> 03:35:08.279 align:start position:0%
James key Wallace I'm the executive
 
03:35:09.830 --> 03:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
director of New Hampshire's business
 
03:35:12.110 --> 03:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
Finance Authority thank you for having
 
03:35:13.610 --> 03:35:13.620 align:start position:0%
me today
 
03:35:15.110 --> 03:35:15.120 align:start position:0%
um I should say right off the bat like
 
03:35:17.030 --> 03:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
the state treasurer's office the BFA
 
03:35:19.250 --> 03:35:19.260 align:start position:0%
does not support or oppose legislation
 
03:35:22.130 --> 03:35:22.140 align:start position:0%
but we're here as technical advisors to
 
03:35:24.170 --> 03:35:24.180 align:start position:0%
the legislature and other apparatus
 
03:35:25.790 --> 03:35:25.800 align:start position:0%
within the state government
 
03:35:25.800 --> 03:35:26.510 align:start position:0%
within the state government
um

03:35:26.510 --> 03:35:26.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:28.670 --> 03:35:28.680 align:start position:0%
in this proposed Bill we would
 
03:35:30.769 --> 03:35:30.779 align:start position:0%
administer the trust that would be
 
03:35:33.170 --> 03:35:33.180 align:start position:0%
established if the legislature moved
 
03:35:34.790 --> 03:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
forward with the action
 
03:35:36.410 --> 03:35:36.420 align:start position:0%
the monies that were being discussed
 
03:35:38.510 --> 03:35:38.520 align:start position:0%
will be put in a trust held in a
 
03:35:40.610 --> 03:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
separate account for this purpose along
 
03:35:42.530 --> 03:35:42.540 align:start position:0%
with any interest earned on that trust
 
03:35:45.710 --> 03:35:45.720 align:start position:0%
and we would design a program
 
03:35:47.809 --> 03:35:47.819 align:start position:0%
with all the parameters of how much is
 
03:35:49.790 --> 03:35:49.800 align:start position:0%
the maximum that would be forgiven you
 
03:35:51.469 --> 03:35:51.479 align:start position:0%
know how do all the rules work we have
 
03:35:52.969 --> 03:35:52.979 align:start position:0%
some thoughts on that already I'm happy
 
03:35:54.830 --> 03:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
to take you through but we would bring
 
03:35:58.610 --> 03:35:58.620 align:start position:0%
all those ideas to the fiscal committee
 
03:36:00.889 --> 03:36:00.899 align:start position:0%
which is the same process we had to go
 
03:36:03.190 --> 03:36:03.200 align:start position:0%
through with the Army student loan
 
03:36:06.050 --> 03:36:06.060 align:start position:0%
Provisions get approval from the
 
03:36:09.550 --> 03:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
legislature and then enact the program
 
03:36:12.410 --> 03:36:12.420 align:start position:0%
so I'm here to both answer any questions
 
03:36:14.389 --> 03:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
that you might have and I'm also willing
 
03:36:15.650 --> 03:36:15.660 align:start position:0%
to take you through some of the
 
03:36:17.690 --> 03:36:17.700 align:start position:0%
mechanics of how the program would be
 
03:36:21.050 --> 03:36:21.060 align:start position:0%
administered we think if that would be
 
03:36:24.469 --> 03:36:24.479 align:start position:0%
helpful to the committee
 
03:36:26.090 --> 03:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
03:36:29.450 --> 03:36:29.460 align:start position:0%
the Army program how many people were
 
03:36:31.910 --> 03:36:31.920 align:start position:0%
given distributions and what was the
 
03:36:34.370 --> 03:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
total amount
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
um it's a good question uh
 
03:36:38.750 --> 03:36:38.760 align:start position:0%
representative so the Army program
 
03:36:42.170 --> 03:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
although the bill was passed to create
 
03:36:44.330 --> 03:36:44.340 align:start position:0%
the student debit the forgiveness
 
03:36:47.269 --> 03:36:47.279 align:start position:0%
program uh it was never provided any
 
03:36:50.410 --> 03:36:50.420 align:start position:0%
funding to operate or provide any of the
 
03:36:53.330 --> 03:36:53.340 align:start position:0%
uh forgiveness until actually quite
 
03:36:53.340 --> 03:36:54.889 align:start position:0%
uh forgiveness until actually quite
recently

03:36:54.889 --> 03:36:54.899 align:start position:0%
recently
 
03:36:56.630 --> 03:36:56.640 align:start position:0%
um I don't know exactly what it was but
 
03:36:58.370 --> 03:36:58.380 align:start position:0%
there was a little bit of extra I think
 
03:37:00.610 --> 03:37:00.620 align:start position:0%
there was a surplus funds conversation
 
03:37:03.229 --> 03:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
very recently then the last session and
 
03:37:06.170 --> 03:37:06.180 align:start position:0%
they put a one million dollar allocation
 
03:37:08.150 --> 03:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
into that program
 
03:37:11.090 --> 03:37:11.100 align:start position:0%
and so that kicked off us being able to
 
03:37:12.590 --> 03:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
actually design the parameters of the
 
03:37:14.990 --> 03:37:15.000 align:start position:0%
program so that's the stage it's in
 
03:37:17.330 --> 03:37:17.340 align:start position:0%
we're getting ready we hope to bring it
 
03:37:19.190 --> 03:37:19.200 align:start position:0%
to fiscal soon for their approval so
 
03:37:21.170 --> 03:37:21.180 align:start position:0%
zero to answer your question directly
 
03:37:24.349 --> 03:37:24.359 align:start position:0%
that was like five years ago yeah yeah
 
03:37:28.729 --> 03:37:28.739 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not exactly sure what triggered
 
03:37:32.330 --> 03:37:32.340 align:start position:0%
the funding into the program just a
 
03:37:34.790 --> 03:37:34.800 align:start position:0%
number of months ago you might know I I
 
03:37:38.630 --> 03:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
got the call and uh we went to work and
 
03:37:40.670 --> 03:37:40.680 align:start position:0%
I think maybe there was a
 
03:37:43.190 --> 03:37:43.200 align:start position:0%
a period of time that people would have
 
03:37:44.750 --> 03:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
to keep working before they would even
 
03:37:47.210 --> 03:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
qualify in other words oh here I am I'm
 
03:37:49.490 --> 03:37:49.500 align:start position:0%
working for Army I want some forgiveness
 
03:37:52.010 --> 03:37:52.020 align:start position:0%
on my scholarship okay you have to be
 
03:37:53.450 --> 03:37:53.460 align:start position:0%
with us a number of years before we're
 
03:37:55.309 --> 03:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
going to give you any forgiveness
 
03:37:57.710 --> 03:37:57.720 align:start position:0%
yes representative that's right the
 
03:38:00.050 --> 03:38:00.060 align:start position:0%
model proposed here is actually very
 
03:38:01.849 --> 03:38:01.859 align:start position:0%
similar to the model that was passed
 
03:38:04.490 --> 03:38:04.500 align:start position:0%
with the Army uh you know regenerative
 
03:38:07.130 --> 03:38:07.140 align:start position:0%
medicine bills in that case it was work
 
03:38:09.410 --> 03:38:09.420 align:start position:0%
here for five years and then you'd be
 
03:38:11.389 --> 03:38:11.399 align:start position:0%
eligible forgiveness up to a maximum
 
03:38:13.790 --> 03:38:13.800 align:start position:0%
amount that would be defined in the
 
03:38:16.490 --> 03:38:16.500 align:start position:0%
rules which was by the way proposed to
 
03:38:18.110 --> 03:38:18.120 align:start position:0%
be twenty five thousand dollars at the
 
03:38:18.120 --> 03:38:19.309 align:start position:0%
be twenty five thousand dollars at the
time

03:38:19.309 --> 03:38:19.319 align:start position:0%
time
 
03:38:23.450 --> 03:38:23.460 align:start position:0%
um this legislation proposes to shorten
 
03:38:25.429 --> 03:38:25.439 align:start position:0%
the required working window to three
 
03:38:27.769 --> 03:38:27.779 align:start position:0%
years instead of five years
 
03:38:30.050 --> 03:38:30.060 align:start position:0%
there had been some feedback that five
 
03:38:33.349 --> 03:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
years was just a long time to wait to
 
03:38:36.530 --> 03:38:36.540 align:start position:0%
effectively recruit Workforce and that
 
03:38:38.389 --> 03:38:38.399 align:start position:0%
given the immediacy of the crisis that a
 
03:38:39.769 --> 03:38:39.779 align:start position:0%
three-year window would be more
 
03:38:39.779 --> 03:38:41.090 align:start position:0%
three-year window would be more
advisable

03:38:41.090 --> 03:38:41.100 align:start position:0%
advisable
 
03:38:43.010 --> 03:38:43.020 align:start position:0%
has anyone filled out paperwork to
 
03:38:44.809 --> 03:38:44.819 align:start position:0%
qualify yet
 
03:38:48.229 --> 03:38:48.239 align:start position:0%
not yet no the applications haven't the
 
03:38:50.450 --> 03:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
window's not open yet we're bringing the
 
03:38:53.389 --> 03:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
proposed rules to fiscal for their
 
03:38:56.330 --> 03:38:56.340 align:start position:0%
approval soon and then I know there's
 
03:38:57.889 --> 03:38:57.899 align:start position:0%
demand people call and ask when it's
 
03:38:59.570 --> 03:38:59.580 align:start position:0%
going to be ready I guess there was no
 
03:39:01.250 --> 03:39:01.260 align:start position:0%
good follow-up I haven't heard of the
 
03:39:04.010 --> 03:39:04.020 align:start position:0%
program since it was past five years ago
 
03:39:07.729 --> 03:39:07.739 align:start position:0%
it really went dormant until the funding
 
03:39:09.889 --> 03:39:09.899 align:start position:0%
was made available for it to now enter
 
03:39:11.870 --> 03:39:11.880 align:start position:0%
the request for funding either
 
03:39:14.990 --> 03:39:15.000 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm I'm not sure
 
03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
how it happened uh but was the source
 
03:39:20.450 --> 03:39:20.460 align:start position:0%
supposed to be at its Inception
 
03:39:23.090 --> 03:39:23.100 align:start position:0%
General funds okay thank you thank you
 
03:39:24.769 --> 03:39:24.779 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
03:39:26.450 --> 03:39:26.460 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
03:39:29.090 --> 03:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
taking the questions you just mentioned
 
03:39:30.889 --> 03:39:30.899 align:start position:0%
that five years is a long time to wait
 
03:39:33.170 --> 03:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
am I to understand that that means that
 
03:39:35.510 --> 03:39:35.520 align:start position:0%
the you know
 
03:39:38.389 --> 03:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
contribution is only given at the very
 
03:39:40.309 --> 03:39:40.319 align:start position:0%
end of the term so you gotta first go
 
03:39:42.050 --> 03:39:42.060 align:start position:0%
through five years and then you get a
 
03:39:44.570 --> 03:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
one-time loan payment yes that's right
 
03:39:47.150 --> 03:39:47.160 align:start position:0%
representative the payment would come at
 
03:39:50.030 --> 03:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
the end of a five-year period if you
 
03:39:53.030 --> 03:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
continue to be eligible uh you're not
 
03:39:54.769 --> 03:39:54.779 align:start position:0%
actually locked into a particular
 
03:39:57.050 --> 03:39:57.060 align:start position:0%
employer for those five years as long as
 
03:39:59.090 --> 03:39:59.100 align:start position:0%
you're working at an employer who's
 
03:40:00.650 --> 03:40:00.660 align:start position:0%
eligible so if you're a nurse in
 
03:40:02.929 --> 03:40:02.939 align:start position:0%
hospital one and you switch to a nurse
 
03:40:04.969 --> 03:40:04.979 align:start position:0%
being at hospital two
 
03:40:07.570 --> 03:40:07.580 align:start position:0%
you don't get kicked out of the program
 
03:40:10.130 --> 03:40:10.140 align:start position:0%
as long as you continue to be at what's
 
03:40:12.710 --> 03:40:12.720 align:start position:0%
defined as an eligible employer so as a
 
03:40:15.769 --> 03:40:15.779 align:start position:0%
quick follow-up would you because that
 
03:40:18.290 --> 03:40:18.300 align:start position:0%
is a concern and I agree with you
 
03:40:21.050 --> 03:40:21.060 align:start position:0%
if for example this program would be you
 
03:40:22.250 --> 03:40:22.260 align:start position:0%
know the program we are talking about
 
03:40:24.229 --> 03:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
which is currently proposed for three
 
03:40:26.150 --> 03:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
years would be extended to five would
 
03:40:29.510 --> 03:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
you think that if we change or we
 
03:40:31.190 --> 03:40:31.200 align:start position:0%
suggest a change because I know this is
 
03:40:33.290 --> 03:40:33.300 align:start position:0%
not our you know daily weight but would
 
03:40:34.969 --> 03:40:34.979 align:start position:0%
it be effective if you decide to
 
03:40:37.429 --> 03:40:37.439 align:start position:0%
allocate at least part of the benefit
 
03:40:39.349 --> 03:40:39.359 align:start position:0%
through the years and then I have a
 
03:40:41.990 --> 03:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
smaller lump payment at the end I'm just
 
03:40:43.969 --> 03:40:43.979 align:start position:0%
curious as to various possibilities I do
 
03:40:45.650 --> 03:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
recognize that that's not the you know
 
03:40:47.450 --> 03:40:47.460 align:start position:0%
the law that we're discussing does not
 
03:40:50.150 --> 03:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
specify that but in making the decisions
 
03:40:52.370 --> 03:40:52.380 align:start position:0%
over the term it's good to know whether
 
03:40:54.889 --> 03:40:54.899 align:start position:0%
you would have that flexibility to make
 
03:40:57.110 --> 03:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
it more effective even with a longer
 
03:40:59.510 --> 03:40:59.520 align:start position:0%
term thank you representative you're
 
03:41:01.070 --> 03:41:01.080 align:start position:0%
touching on the question that we
 
03:41:02.570 --> 03:41:02.580 align:start position:0%
actually probably talked about the most
 
03:41:04.250 --> 03:41:04.260 align:start position:0%
because it's in some ways the most
 
03:41:05.990 --> 03:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
interesting you know question except for
 
03:41:08.090 --> 03:41:08.100 align:start position:0%
how do you pay for it right but
 
03:41:12.349 --> 03:41:12.359 align:start position:0%
um the original thinking which is now
 
03:41:15.349 --> 03:41:15.359 align:start position:0%
you know is that we would actually pay
 
03:41:17.750 --> 03:41:17.760 align:start position:0%
down a portion of those student loans a
 
03:41:20.090 --> 03:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
little bit every year
 
03:41:23.630 --> 03:41:23.640 align:start position:0%
when you introduce that concept you to
 
03:41:25.190 --> 03:41:25.200 align:start position:0%
run a good program also need to
 
03:41:28.070 --> 03:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
introduce a clawback provision of what
 
03:41:30.349 --> 03:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
if you don't fulfill the term of your
 
03:41:32.210 --> 03:41:32.220 align:start position:0%
obligation and you and you leave early
 
03:41:34.729 --> 03:41:34.739 align:start position:0%
you know now you've you know only worked
 
03:41:36.110 --> 03:41:36.120 align:start position:0%
for here for a year and you've gotten a
 
03:41:37.309 --> 03:41:37.319 align:start position:0%
big chunk of money and is that really
 
03:41:38.990 --> 03:41:39.000 align:start position:0%
what we wanted to do
 
03:41:42.110 --> 03:41:42.120 align:start position:0%
the thinking was no
 
03:41:46.070 --> 03:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
problem was There's no practical
 
03:41:48.290 --> 03:41:48.300 align:start position:0%
clawback mechanism the only way to do
 
03:41:50.929 --> 03:41:50.939 align:start position:0%
that was actually to technically lend it
 
03:41:53.870 --> 03:41:53.880 align:start position:0%
to the enrollee those Loans pay down
 
03:41:55.550 --> 03:41:55.560 align:start position:0%
their student loans by a small amount
 
03:41:58.309 --> 03:41:58.319 align:start position:0%
each year and then you have to enforce
 
03:41:59.990 --> 03:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
their obligations under the loan
 
03:42:02.030 --> 03:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
documents to repay you back but it's
 
03:42:04.130 --> 03:42:04.140 align:start position:0%
governed now now the state is a student
 
03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
lender fully understood and actually
 
03:42:08.510 --> 03:42:08.520 align:start position:0%
based on my experience at a town of
 
03:42:10.309 --> 03:42:10.319 align:start position:0%
Windham I've been the finance director
 
03:42:12.950 --> 03:42:12.960 align:start position:0%
for six years and a half I find those
 
03:42:15.469 --> 03:42:15.479 align:start position:0%
types of callbacks to be amazingly
 
03:42:17.510 --> 03:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
difficult to enforce even when the legal
 
03:42:19.969 --> 03:42:19.979 align:start position:0%
right is there so I had no thought of a
 
03:42:22.250 --> 03:42:22.260 align:start position:0%
clawback that's why I was suggesting
 
03:42:25.309 --> 03:42:25.319 align:start position:0%
that by setting say half of it at the
 
03:42:27.889 --> 03:42:27.899 align:start position:0%
end and then just making smaller ten
 
03:42:30.410 --> 03:42:30.420 align:start position:0%
percent payments over five years the
 
03:42:32.330 --> 03:42:32.340 align:start position:0%
state could argue that you know only the
 
03:42:34.729 --> 03:42:34.739 align:start position:0%
50 percent was bound by the full five
 
03:42:36.410 --> 03:42:36.420 align:start position:0%
years and the rest of it was earned as
 
03:42:38.150 --> 03:42:38.160 align:start position:0%
we go now I'm not sure if the text of
 
03:42:40.550 --> 03:42:40.560 align:start position:0%
the hb2 has proposed would allow that
 
03:42:42.950 --> 03:42:42.960 align:start position:0%
but I'm just asking for forget the
 
03:42:44.450 --> 03:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
legislation I just want to understand
 
03:42:46.490 --> 03:42:46.500 align:start position:0%
how you would whether you would find
 
03:42:48.710 --> 03:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
this a more effective method
 
03:42:50.990 --> 03:42:51.000 align:start position:0%
in terms of addressing some of those
 
03:42:53.090 --> 03:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
concerns about boy five years is a long
 
03:42:54.830 --> 03:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
time to wait but if I get 10 percent
 
03:42:56.570 --> 03:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
every year and then fifty percent after
 
03:42:58.130 --> 03:42:58.140 align:start position:0%
five would that make the five years
 
03:43:00.290 --> 03:43:00.300 align:start position:0%
easier to manage sure yeah that's a
 
03:43:01.250 --> 03:43:01.260 align:start position:0%
great question
 
03:43:04.130 --> 03:43:04.140 align:start position:0%
um uh the current language in hp2 is
 
03:43:05.750 --> 03:43:05.760 align:start position:0%
proposed does not allow that
 
03:43:05.760 --> 03:43:06.590 align:start position:0%
proposed does not allow that
um

03:43:06.590 --> 03:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:09.830 --> 03:43:09.840 align:start position:0%
paying a little along the way actually
 
03:43:12.889 --> 03:43:12.899 align:start position:0%
has a tremendous amount of benefits a
 
03:43:15.050 --> 03:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
surprising amount of benefits because
 
03:43:16.849 --> 03:43:16.859 align:start position:0%
the way that it would work is an
 
03:43:19.309 --> 03:43:19.319 align:start position:0%
enrollee is in the program
 
03:43:21.349 --> 03:43:21.359 align:start position:0%
they have to keep making their payments
 
03:43:22.969 --> 03:43:22.979 align:start position:0%
throughout the program
 
03:43:26.090 --> 03:43:26.100 align:start position:0%
and if early on the program say year one
 
03:43:29.570 --> 03:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
you were to pay down that loan by some
 
03:43:31.910 --> 03:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
amount and they keep making those
 
03:43:34.610 --> 03:43:34.620 align:start position:0%
payments more of their own payment is
 
03:43:36.769 --> 03:43:36.779 align:start position:0%
going to principal and less to interest
 
03:43:40.010 --> 03:43:40.020 align:start position:0%
and they actually end up paying more of
 
03:43:41.750 --> 03:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
their own student loan by themselves
 
03:43:43.550 --> 03:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
because they're not racking up as much
 
03:43:45.769 --> 03:43:45.779 align:start position:0%
interest along the way and it's it's
 
03:43:47.690 --> 03:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
quite remarkable how even a little
 
03:43:51.050 --> 03:43:51.060 align:start position:0%
payment early on can end up it's like
 
03:43:52.429 --> 03:43:52.439 align:start position:0%
your mortgage right you make an extra
 
03:43:54.830 --> 03:43:54.840 align:start position:0%
payment early on you're out five years
 
03:43:58.910 --> 03:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
early right it's that sort of math so
 
03:44:01.429 --> 03:44:01.439 align:start position:0%
early payments all other things being
 
03:44:01.439 --> 03:44:02.389 align:start position:0%
early payments all other things being
equal

03:44:02.389 --> 03:44:02.399 align:start position:0%
equal
 
03:44:04.910 --> 03:44:04.920 align:start position:0%
are exponentially more attractive to the
 
03:44:10.550 --> 03:44:10.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:13.490 --> 03:44:13.500 align:start position:0%
the original army program went through
 
03:44:16.370 --> 03:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
the full legislature it was voted on as
 
03:44:17.330 --> 03:44:17.340 align:start position:0%
a bill
 
03:44:19.910 --> 03:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
and then I didn't realize it wasn't
 
03:44:21.830 --> 03:44:21.840 align:start position:0%
funded but now that I see that there's a
 
03:44:24.110 --> 03:44:24.120 align:start position:0%
five-year requirement I could see why if
 
03:44:25.849 --> 03:44:25.859 align:start position:0%
this was coming to us merely as the
 
03:44:27.290 --> 03:44:27.300 align:start position:0%
funding source that would be one thing
 
03:44:31.010 --> 03:44:31.020 align:start position:0%
but it rearranges everything this
 
03:44:34.790 --> 03:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
I'm upset at this being just an hb2 and
 
03:44:36.889 --> 03:44:36.899 align:start position:0%
not presented as a separate bill because
 
03:44:39.410 --> 03:44:39.420 align:start position:0%
there are some policy changes here that
 
03:44:41.090 --> 03:44:41.100 align:start position:0%
that probably should have been looked at
 
03:44:44.090 --> 03:44:44.100 align:start position:0%
the same way the original bill was I'm
 
03:44:45.710 --> 03:44:45.720 align:start position:0%
going to discuss this anyway with the
 
03:44:48.250 --> 03:44:48.260 align:start position:0%
with the 529
 
03:44:50.929 --> 03:44:50.939 align:start position:0%
committee and and because this is being
 
03:44:52.849 --> 03:44:52.859 align:start position:0%
added to the sections that that we're
 
03:44:54.290 --> 03:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
dealing with so
 
03:44:57.170 --> 03:44:57.180 align:start position:0%
it is it is rather unusual to not only
 
03:44:59.290 --> 03:44:59.300 align:start position:0%
it what was approved by the full
 
03:45:01.790 --> 03:45:01.800 align:start position:0%
legislature now comes back to us to just
 
03:45:03.469 --> 03:45:03.479 align:start position:0%
the finance committee to say oh by the
 
03:45:05.809 --> 03:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
way here's two or three changes in we're
 
03:45:08.150 --> 03:45:08.160 align:start position:0%
going from five years to three years and
 
03:45:10.370 --> 03:45:10.380 align:start position:0%
so on and so forth
 
03:45:12.469 --> 03:45:12.479 align:start position:0%
um it I'm not I'm not comfortable with
 
03:45:14.929 --> 03:45:14.939 align:start position:0%
it anyway thank you
 
03:45:16.610 --> 03:45:16.620 align:start position:0%
the question came up earlier about
 
03:45:18.349 --> 03:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
promoting this
 
03:45:18.359 --> 03:45:20.150 align:start position:0%
promoting this
availability

03:45:20.150 --> 03:45:20.160 align:start position:0%
availability
 
03:45:22.309 --> 03:45:22.319 align:start position:0%
and if people are calling you already it
 
03:45:24.110 --> 03:45:24.120 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like promoting it is a big
 
03:45:24.120 --> 03:45:26.150 align:start position:0%
doesn't sound like promoting it is a big
problem

03:45:26.150 --> 03:45:26.160 align:start position:0%
problem
 
03:45:28.610 --> 03:45:28.620 align:start position:0%
yes thank you uh Mr chair it's a good
 
03:45:30.110 --> 03:45:30.120 align:start position:0%
question actually no one has asked it
 
03:45:31.370 --> 03:45:31.380 align:start position:0%
yet so I was sitting in the back
 
03:45:34.010 --> 03:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
thinking huh you know
 
03:45:36.710 --> 03:45:36.720 align:start position:0%
um you know I I can tell you that the
 
03:45:39.469 --> 03:45:39.479 align:start position:0%
way we envision this is it's this is
 
03:45:39.479 --> 03:45:40.309 align:start position:0%
way we envision this is it's this is
really

03:45:40.309 --> 03:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
um a tool for employers to recruit
 
03:45:45.290 --> 03:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
Workforce so it's not so much the state
 
03:45:47.229 --> 03:45:47.239 align:start position:0%
going saying hey come to New Hampshire
 
03:45:49.490 --> 03:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
you know we'll help with student loans
 
03:45:50.630 --> 03:45:50.640 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
03:45:53.510 --> 03:45:53.520 align:start position:0%
hey these employers can go to the
 
03:45:56.269 --> 03:45:56.279 align:start position:0%
workforce and say come work for me in
 
03:45:58.010 --> 03:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and we'll help you with
 
03:46:00.110 --> 03:46:00.120 align:start position:0%
your student loans and so really the
 
03:46:02.150 --> 03:46:02.160 align:start position:0%
employers it's it's a public-private
 
03:46:03.769 --> 03:46:03.779 align:start position:0%
partnership the employers would be the
 
03:46:06.530 --> 03:46:06.540 align:start position:0%
ones who get the word out
 
03:46:06.540 --> 03:46:07.370 align:start position:0%
ones who get the word out
um

03:46:07.370 --> 03:46:07.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:46:09.530 --> 03:46:09.540 align:start position:0%
but whether or not it actually casts the
 
03:46:11.210 --> 03:46:11.220 align:start position:0%
state in a good light as a whole and
 
03:46:12.889 --> 03:46:12.899 align:start position:0%
should be promoted actually is I think a
 
03:46:15.650 --> 03:46:15.660 align:start position:0%
pretty interesting question
 
03:46:17.510 --> 03:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
another way to look at it back to your
 
03:46:20.510 --> 03:46:20.520 align:start position:0%
point early payments are very savings
 
03:46:22.250 --> 03:46:22.260 align:start position:0%
like paid off a
 
03:46:24.530 --> 03:46:24.540 align:start position:0%
30-year mortgage in seven years with a
 
03:46:26.929 --> 03:46:26.939 align:start position:0%
couple hundred extra bucks a month and
 
03:46:31.309 --> 03:46:31.319 align:start position:0%
uh but so by the same token
 
03:46:32.929 --> 03:46:32.939 align:start position:0%
you give someone a thousand dollars
 
03:46:34.910 --> 03:46:34.920 align:start position:0%
while they're in college now it saves
 
03:46:37.190 --> 03:46:37.200 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars later in
 
03:46:40.550 --> 03:46:40.560 align:start position:0%
and payments for a tuition loan so we've
 
03:46:43.190 --> 03:46:43.200 align:start position:0%
got people already paying a tuition loan
 
03:46:45.110 --> 03:46:45.120 align:start position:0%
are they were they New Hampshire
 
03:46:47.150 --> 03:46:47.160 align:start position:0%
students which was the whole focus of
 
03:46:49.070 --> 03:46:49.080 align:start position:0%
this thing anyway or they come from
 
03:46:50.330 --> 03:46:50.340 align:start position:0%
somewhere else
 
03:46:54.650 --> 03:46:54.660 align:start position:0%
so it puts a whole new spin on the thing
 
03:46:56.630 --> 03:46:56.640 align:start position:0%
if I'm looking for where the money gets
 
03:46:58.550 --> 03:46:58.560 align:start position:0%
me the most Buck it's to give it to the
 
03:47:01.010 --> 03:47:01.020 align:start position:0%
scholarship to the student now rather
 
03:47:02.750 --> 03:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
than paying making payments on the
 
03:47:04.969 --> 03:47:04.979 align:start position:0%
student loans anyway that's
 
03:47:06.830 --> 03:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
looking at it from the same way you're
 
03:47:09.170 --> 03:47:09.180 align:start position:0%
looking at it early payments count more
 
03:47:12.530 --> 03:47:12.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:14.330 --> 03:47:14.340 align:start position:0%
a quick addition to representative
 
03:47:16.550 --> 03:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
Wireless comments I agree with you know
 
03:47:19.130 --> 03:47:19.140 align:start position:0%
most of them but I'm looking at the fact
 
03:47:20.929 --> 03:47:20.939 align:start position:0%
that we have an obligation to help our
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
residents absolutely whether they stay
 
03:47:25.729 --> 03:47:25.739 align:start position:0%
in the state or not I mean they are New
 
03:47:27.349 --> 03:47:27.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children raised by New
 
03:47:29.389 --> 03:47:29.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire families so I I'm very happy
 
03:47:32.570 --> 03:47:32.580 align:start position:0%
with that but I would argue that uh
 
03:47:36.410 --> 03:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
using a good portion of this to fund
 
03:47:38.690 --> 03:47:38.700 align:start position:0%
people who then come and live and work
 
03:47:38.700 --> 03:47:39.889 align:start position:0%
people who then come and live and work
here

03:47:39.889 --> 03:47:39.899 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:47:42.710 --> 03:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
maybe uh you know better use of the
 
03:47:44.690 --> 03:47:44.700 align:start position:0%
money in terms of the overall long-term
 
03:47:47.630 --> 03:47:47.640 align:start position:0%
benefits for the state because we do
 
03:47:50.030 --> 03:47:50.040 align:start position:0%
need we are hugely challenged in terms
 
03:47:52.729 --> 03:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
of Workforce and anything that we can do
 
03:47:54.769 --> 03:47:54.779 align:start position:0%
to bring people here
 
03:47:56.809 --> 03:47:56.819 align:start position:0%
I don't think that a lot of people will
 
03:47:58.610 --> 03:47:58.620 align:start position:0%
stay here for the five years and say
 
03:48:00.710 --> 03:48:00.720 align:start position:0%
geez you know I've hated this place for
 
03:48:02.690 --> 03:48:02.700 align:start position:0%
five years but I got my student loans
 
03:48:05.510 --> 03:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
paid now I can go usually when you're
 
03:48:07.610 --> 03:48:07.620 align:start position:0%
staying somewhere for five years you are
 
03:48:09.349 --> 03:48:09.359 align:start position:0%
feeling pretty comfortable and you stay
 
03:48:11.690 --> 03:48:11.700 align:start position:0%
there so I would really like to see a
 
03:48:13.550 --> 03:48:13.560 align:start position:0%
balance of the two you know where you
 
03:48:15.950 --> 03:48:15.960 align:start position:0%
have you know the direct scholarships
 
03:48:19.250 --> 03:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
and then also this form of uh trying to
 
03:48:23.450 --> 03:48:23.460 align:start position:0%
uh you know attract the exact type of
 
03:48:25.969 --> 03:48:25.979 align:start position:0%
employees that we so desperately need in
 
03:48:27.410 --> 03:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
the state we keep talking about
 
03:48:29.570 --> 03:48:29.580 align:start position:0%
shortages both for the public and
 
03:48:31.849 --> 03:48:31.859 align:start position:0%
private sector this seems to be a very
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
targeted use of funds uh yes thank you
 
03:48:36.769 --> 03:48:36.779 align:start position:0%
representative and you know again we
 
03:48:38.630 --> 03:48:38.640 align:start position:0%
don't take positions on the on the bill
 
03:48:41.210 --> 03:48:41.220 align:start position:0%
I you know the way I read it is it's
 
03:48:42.710 --> 03:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
trying to do
 
03:48:44.809 --> 03:48:44.819 align:start position:0%
two things really it's trying to sort of
 
03:48:47.630 --> 03:48:47.640 align:start position:0%
maintain Workforce Development through a
 
03:48:49.729 --> 03:48:49.739 align:start position:0%
push strategy right pushing people
 
03:48:51.349 --> 03:48:51.359 align:start position:0%
through the university system by
 
03:48:53.510 --> 03:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
offering scholarships because we know if
 
03:48:55.309 --> 03:48:55.319 align:start position:0%
you graduate here you're more likely to
 
03:48:56.990 --> 03:48:57.000 align:start position:0%
stay here you're not guaranteed to stay
 
03:48:58.790 --> 03:48:58.800 align:start position:0%
here but you're more likely to stay here
 
03:49:02.090 --> 03:49:02.100 align:start position:0%
but it's also adding a pull strategy to
 
03:49:04.190 --> 03:49:04.200 align:start position:0%
say well let's continue to help people
 
03:49:07.070 --> 03:49:07.080 align:start position:0%
go to school here and hope they stay at
 
03:49:09.110 --> 03:49:09.120 align:start position:0%
the same time let's pull people from our
 
03:49:10.969 --> 03:49:10.979 align:start position:0%
own schools who graduate but also the
 
03:49:12.290 --> 03:49:12.300 align:start position:0%
best and the brightest from anywhere in
 
03:49:14.630 --> 03:49:14.640 align:start position:0%
the country right and bring those to our
 
03:49:17.210 --> 03:49:17.220 align:start position:0%
employers here in our state by offering
 
03:49:19.190 --> 03:49:19.200 align:start position:0%
loan forgiveness as a tool for those
 
03:49:20.870 --> 03:49:20.880 align:start position:0%
employers so I think the I think the
 
03:49:23.090 --> 03:49:23.100 align:start position:0%
policy is trying to say is you know
 
03:49:26.690 --> 03:49:26.700 align:start position:0%
let's do both right that's how I that's
 
03:49:29.269 --> 03:49:29.279 align:start position:0%
how I read it I think the question is is
 
03:49:31.190 --> 03:49:31.200 align:start position:0%
both what the legislature wants to do
 
03:49:33.469 --> 03:49:33.479 align:start position:0%
you know or how they want to pay for it
 
03:49:36.250 --> 03:49:36.260 align:start position:0%
then that's the ultimate question
 
03:49:37.969 --> 03:49:37.979 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:49:40.969 --> 03:49:40.979 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for being here I believe
 
03:49:42.889 --> 03:49:42.899 align:start position:0%
the goal is the same for the scholarship
 
03:49:46.429 --> 03:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
program as well as this new program uh
 
03:49:49.010 --> 03:49:49.020 align:start position:0%
you know we're looking for workers to
 
03:49:51.950 --> 03:49:51.960 align:start position:0%
work and live here and it it uh you know
 
03:49:55.550 --> 03:49:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's the same goal no matter how we
 
03:49:57.349 --> 03:49:57.359 align:start position:0%
get there and we've got to remember that
 
03:49:59.150 --> 03:49:59.160 align:start position:0%
59 of the people live in New Hampshire
 
03:50:01.910 --> 03:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
were born someplace else so we are an
 
03:50:05.150 --> 03:50:05.160 align:start position:0%
immigrant State thank you
 
03:50:06.710 --> 03:50:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you representative as one of those
 
03:50:09.410 --> 03:50:09.420 align:start position:0%
I I completely agree I was five I hope I
 
03:50:12.349 --> 03:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
count as a resident but uh but hey yeah
 
03:50:13.849 --> 03:50:13.859 align:start position:0%
once you start complaining about
 
03:50:15.650 --> 03:50:15.660 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts driver
 
03:50:17.870 --> 03:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
oh and then I think I was I was probably
 
03:50:21.050 --> 03:50:21.060 align:start position:0%
six when that happened so
 
03:50:23.870 --> 03:50:23.880 align:start position:0%
or or the people who saw you move in die
 
03:50:25.809 --> 03:50:25.819 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
03:50:28.550 --> 03:50:28.560 align:start position:0%
any other questions
 
03:50:30.229 --> 03:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much all right thank
 
03:50:30.239 --> 03:50:54.110 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much all right thank
you

03:50:54.110 --> 03:50:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:11.210 --> 03:51:11.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:11.220 --> 03:51:13.849 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:51:13.849 --> 03:51:13.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:13.859 --> 03:51:23.929 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

03:51:23.929 --> 03:51:23.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:25.670 --> 03:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
03:51:25.680 --> 03:51:26.630 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
so

03:51:26.630 --> 03:51:26.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:51:28.729 --> 03:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
um Richard lavers Deputy Commissioner at
 
03:51:29.750 --> 03:51:29.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Department of
 
03:51:32.690 --> 03:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
Employment Security and where I got my
 
03:51:34.490 --> 03:51:34.500 align:start position:0%
director of the economic and labor
 
03:51:36.410 --> 03:51:36.420 align:start position:0%
market information Bureau the Department
 
03:51:39.110 --> 03:51:39.120 align:start position:0%
of Employment Security
 
03:51:40.070 --> 03:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:51:42.170 --> 03:51:42.180 align:start position:0%
um we're here just to help provide a
 
03:51:44.269 --> 03:51:44.279 align:start position:0%
little bit more context uh to the
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
proposal from the workforce uh
 
03:51:49.309 --> 03:51:49.319 align:start position:0%
perspective so some of the members might
 
03:51:50.870 --> 03:51:50.880 align:start position:0%
have attended one of the earlier
 
03:51:53.929 --> 03:51:53.939 align:start position:0%
sessions that we had uh where we had
 
03:51:56.929 --> 03:51:56.939 align:start position:0%
provided some information to uh the ways
 
03:51:58.729 --> 03:51:58.739 align:start position:0%
and means Committees of of both Chambers
 
03:52:01.490 --> 03:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
I know several of the finance committee
 
03:52:03.290 --> 03:52:03.300 align:start position:0%
members were in attendance as well where
 
03:52:06.170 --> 03:52:06.180 align:start position:0%
we had been asked to look at labor force
 
03:52:10.309 --> 03:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
issues and provide uh our our best
 
03:52:13.370 --> 03:52:13.380 align:start position:0%
effort at forecasting where the New
 
03:52:15.410 --> 03:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire economy was going
 
03:52:19.070 --> 03:52:19.080 align:start position:0%
um and either they hated us so much or
 
03:52:20.510 --> 03:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
they liked us so much they invited us
 
03:52:23.750 --> 03:52:23.760 align:start position:0%
back uh for for a second session
 
03:52:25.070 --> 03:52:25.080 align:start position:0%
um and then we even got invited back for
 
03:52:26.269 --> 03:52:26.279 align:start position:0%
a third session
 
03:52:28.750 --> 03:52:28.760 align:start position:0%
um Mother Nature got in the way of that
 
03:52:32.630 --> 03:52:32.640 align:start position:0%
with a snowstorm but we did provide a
 
03:52:35.150 --> 03:52:35.160 align:start position:0%
significant amount of information with
 
03:52:37.309 --> 03:52:37.319 align:start position:0%
regard to what we feel is a critical
 
03:52:40.190 --> 03:52:40.200 align:start position:0%
issue in temperatures Workforce and
 
03:52:41.990 --> 03:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
overall economy with our health care
 
03:52:45.170 --> 03:52:45.180 align:start position:0%
Workforce and so the information that
 
03:52:47.150 --> 03:52:47.160 align:start position:0%
was provided to the house of Ways and
 
03:52:50.330 --> 03:52:50.340 align:start position:0%
Means Committee is really what we are
 
03:52:53.870 --> 03:52:53.880 align:start position:0%
delivering here to this Committee in how
 
03:52:57.250 --> 03:52:57.260 align:start position:0%
it relates to this proposal in hb2
 
03:52:59.929 --> 03:52:59.939 align:start position:0%
and so we'll we'll walk through some of
 
03:53:01.729 --> 03:53:01.739 align:start position:0%
this information I'll kick us off and
 
03:53:05.389 --> 03:53:05.399 align:start position:0%
Brian who who's responsible for the
 
03:53:08.290 --> 03:53:08.300 align:start position:0%
overwhelming majority of This research
 
03:53:11.769 --> 03:53:11.779 align:start position:0%
will explain some of the information
 
03:53:15.250 --> 03:53:15.260 align:start position:0%
but I think what we're looking at and
 
03:53:18.290 --> 03:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
James key Wallace had indicated a poll
 
03:53:20.990 --> 03:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
strategy we're also looking at an anchor
 
03:53:24.170 --> 03:53:24.180 align:start position:0%
strategy right so providing enough
 
03:53:26.990 --> 03:53:27.000 align:start position:0%
enough of an incentive of once we do
 
03:53:29.750 --> 03:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
pull you back into the state into our
 
03:53:32.290 --> 03:53:32.300 align:start position:0%
Workforce that we're keeping you here
 
03:53:35.030 --> 03:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
and so that's that's a key component of
 
03:53:39.309 --> 03:53:39.319 align:start position:0%
how we can better incentivize
 
03:53:43.610 --> 03:53:43.620 align:start position:0%
individuals to stay here to come here to
 
03:53:45.530 --> 03:53:45.540 align:start position:0%
address some of the critical needs that
 
03:53:47.150 --> 03:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
we are experiencing I'm sure you're
 
03:53:50.450 --> 03:53:50.460 align:start position:0%
hearing about from employers and and
 
03:53:53.210 --> 03:53:53.220 align:start position:0%
constituents in your districts but the
 
03:53:55.610 --> 03:53:55.620 align:start position:0%
critical issues facing our health care
 
03:53:58.429 --> 03:53:58.439 align:start position:0%
Employers in the state
 
03:54:00.710 --> 03:54:00.720 align:start position:0%
um so with that being said when we we
 
03:54:03.349 --> 03:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
turn to the first page and you can see
 
03:54:03.359 --> 03:54:04.370 align:start position:0%
turn to the first page and you can see
here

03:54:04.370 --> 03:54:04.380 align:start position:0%
here
 
03:54:04.380 --> 03:54:06.229 align:start position:0%
here
um

03:54:06.229 --> 03:54:06.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:06.239 --> 03:54:07.429 align:start position:0%
um
how

03:54:07.429 --> 03:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
how
 
03:54:09.950 --> 03:54:09.960 align:start position:0%
each of our employment sectors have
 
03:54:12.889 --> 03:54:12.899 align:start position:0%
fared when we compare to compare where
 
03:54:15.469 --> 03:54:15.479 align:start position:0%
they were prior to the pandemic we look
 
03:54:18.410 --> 03:54:18.420 align:start position:0%
at uh quarter three of calendar year
 
03:54:18.420 --> 03:54:20.110 align:start position:0%
at uh quarter three of calendar year
2019

03:54:20.110 --> 03:54:20.120 align:start position:0%
2019
 
03:54:24.650 --> 03:54:24.660 align:start position:0%
compared to quarter three of 2022 those
 
03:54:26.450 --> 03:54:26.460 align:start position:0%
quarters are the the two selected
 
03:54:27.530 --> 03:54:27.540 align:start position:0%
because we wanted to compare
 
03:54:30.410 --> 03:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
pre-pandemic and as current as we can
 
03:54:33.830 --> 03:54:33.840 align:start position:0%
and based off of administrative records
 
03:54:35.570 --> 03:54:35.580 align:start position:0%
that are filed by employers so these
 
03:54:38.030 --> 03:54:38.040 align:start position:0%
these are not a survey based numbers
 
03:54:40.130 --> 03:54:40.140 align:start position:0%
these are based on actual administrative
 
03:54:42.050 --> 03:54:42.060 align:start position:0%
records as employers file with us
 
03:54:44.210 --> 03:54:44.220 align:start position:0%
quarterly with their payroll for
 
03:54:46.610 --> 03:54:46.620 align:start position:0%
unemployment insurance tax purposes so
 
03:54:48.530 --> 03:54:48.540 align:start position:0%
you can see here overall New Hampshire
 
03:54:51.410 --> 03:54:51.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's private sector Workforce
 
03:54:54.290 --> 03:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
has has not only recovered from where
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
they were prior to the pandemic and the
 
03:54:58.370 --> 03:54:58.380 align:start position:0%
peak before the pandemic but they've
 
03:55:01.130 --> 03:55:01.140 align:start position:0%
reached a new Peak so we've we've
 
03:55:04.969 --> 03:55:04.979 align:start position:0%
recovered quite well from a private
 
03:55:08.090 --> 03:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
sector jobs private sector payroll
 
03:55:10.070 --> 03:55:10.080 align:start position:0%
perspective overall
 
03:55:12.889 --> 03:55:12.899 align:start position:0%
however that recovery has not been
 
03:55:16.670 --> 03:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
equally felt across all sectors so what
 
03:55:18.290 --> 03:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
you can see here when we look at the
 
03:55:21.050 --> 03:55:21.060 align:start position:0%
bottom of this chart is some of our
 
03:55:25.070 --> 03:55:25.080 align:start position:0%
sectors that are struggling the most in
 
03:55:27.650 --> 03:55:27.660 align:start position:0%
order to get back to where they were
 
03:55:31.130 --> 03:55:31.140 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 now
 
03:55:31.140 --> 03:55:31.790 align:start position:0%
back in 2019 now
um

03:55:31.790 --> 03:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:55:33.469 --> 03:55:33.479 align:start position:0%
two of the the sectors that we've
 
03:55:35.450 --> 03:55:35.460 align:start position:0%
highlighted and read are our health care
 
03:55:38.210 --> 03:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
sectors so hospitals and long-term care
 
03:55:41.389 --> 03:55:41.399 align:start position:0%
employment you can see how far off they
 
03:55:44.090 --> 03:55:44.100 align:start position:0%
are from where they were prior to the
 
03:55:48.830 --> 03:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
pandemic state government also a a far
 
03:55:51.469 --> 03:55:51.479 align:start position:0%
cry from where they were from an
 
03:55:53.929 --> 03:55:53.939 align:start position:0%
employment perspective prior to the
 
03:55:57.110 --> 03:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
pandemic when we compare actual payroll
 
03:55:57.120 --> 03:55:58.670 align:start position:0%
pandemic when we compare actual payroll
records

03:55:58.670 --> 03:55:58.680 align:start position:0%
records
 
03:56:01.610 --> 03:56:01.620 align:start position:0%
now keying in on on the the health care
 
03:56:03.830 --> 03:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
component of that for purposes of the
 
03:56:06.830 --> 03:56:06.840 align:start position:0%
the provision in hb2 that that you're
 
03:56:10.910 --> 03:56:10.920 align:start position:0%
considering we look at the nature of the
 
03:56:14.330 --> 03:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
decline in our health care sector so
 
03:56:17.990 --> 03:56:18.000 align:start position:0%
moving to that next slide you can see
 
03:56:21.349 --> 03:56:21.359 align:start position:0%
the decline in our health care sector is
 
03:56:23.929 --> 03:56:23.939 align:start position:0%
really in some of our critical nursing
 
03:56:23.939 --> 03:56:25.490 align:start position:0%
really in some of our critical nursing
positions

03:56:25.490 --> 03:56:25.500 align:start position:0%
positions
 
03:56:26.630 --> 03:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:56:26.640 --> 03:56:27.650 align:start position:0%
um so
um

03:56:27.650 --> 03:56:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:56:30.050 --> 03:56:30.060 align:start position:0%
the the bottom of this chart you can see
 
03:56:32.870 --> 03:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
our registered nurses who are the
 
03:56:35.210 --> 03:56:35.220 align:start position:0%
largest component of uh nursing
 
03:56:37.370 --> 03:56:37.380 align:start position:0%
occupational positions in the state in
 
03:56:39.349 --> 03:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
our health care industry
 
03:56:41.269 --> 03:56:41.279 align:start position:0%
um off significantly
 
03:56:42.889 --> 03:56:42.899 align:start position:0%
um and our nursing assistants are
 
03:56:46.370 --> 03:56:46.380 align:start position:0%
licensed nursing assistants lnas off uh
 
03:56:49.729 --> 03:56:49.739 align:start position:0%
significantly when we look at that
 
03:56:52.429 --> 03:56:52.439 align:start position:0%
occupational uh decline you have a
 
03:56:55.070 --> 03:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
question yeah I what you said you
 
03:56:57.889 --> 03:56:57.899 align:start position:0%
collected that data from employers is
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
that specific to a zip code employee zip
 
03:57:01.680 --> 03:57:02.990 align:start position:0%
that specific to a zip code employee zip
code

03:57:02.990 --> 03:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
code
 
03:57:05.330 --> 03:57:05.340 align:start position:0%
so you know what I mean in other words
 
03:57:08.450 --> 03:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
try it back to to a certain town so you
 
03:57:10.910 --> 03:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
can I'm thinking uh
 
03:57:13.729 --> 03:57:13.739 align:start position:0%
poverty reach here and how we can type
 
03:57:15.229 --> 03:57:15.239 align:start position:0%
which which I was thinking at before
 
03:57:17.450 --> 03:57:17.460 align:start position:0%
under Suda I believe it's state
 
03:57:19.250 --> 03:57:19.260 align:start position:0%
unemployment yeah so the state so the
 
03:57:22.309 --> 03:57:22.319 align:start position:0%
state unemployment tax act so the the
 
03:57:25.189 --> 03:57:25.199 align:start position:0%
information that was the basis of that
 
03:57:27.710 --> 03:57:27.720 align:start position:0%
initial slide where I'd reference can
 
03:57:30.530 --> 03:57:30.540 align:start position:0%
you get the aggregate of by Town
 
03:57:32.990 --> 03:57:33.000 align:start position:0%
um what we have there in our uh is our
 
03:57:34.670 --> 03:57:34.680 align:start position:0%
quarterly census of employment and wages
 
03:57:38.030 --> 03:57:38.040 align:start position:0%
our qcw program so that's where every
 
03:57:40.550 --> 03:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
employer who provides employment in New
 
03:57:43.189 --> 03:57:43.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire they they file with us a
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
quarterly report which lists all of
 
03:57:46.790 --> 03:57:46.800 align:start position:0%
their employees and how much they paid
 
03:57:50.389 --> 03:57:50.399 align:start position:0%
them during that quarter uh we then
 
03:57:52.790 --> 03:57:52.800 align:start position:0%
um through uh Brian's Bureau we do
 
03:57:52.800 --> 03:57:53.950 align:start position:0%
um through uh Brian's Bureau we do
provide

03:57:53.950 --> 03:57:53.960 align:start position:0%
provide
 
03:57:56.990 --> 03:57:57.000 align:start position:0%
employment statistics drill down to each
 
03:58:00.050 --> 03:58:00.060 align:start position:0%
Community uh within the state that slide
 
03:58:01.969 --> 03:58:01.979 align:start position:0%
though was looking at the actual records
 
03:58:06.050 --> 03:58:06.060 align:start position:0%
as the the employers who are categorized
 
03:58:08.090 --> 03:58:08.100 align:start position:0%
by the nature of the services or Goods
 
03:58:11.689 --> 03:58:11.699 align:start position:0%
uh that they're they're producing um and
 
03:58:14.630 --> 03:58:14.640 align:start position:0%
and they get put into different
 
03:58:16.550 --> 03:58:16.560 align:start position:0%
um employment sectors that was showing
 
03:58:19.550 --> 03:58:19.560 align:start position:0%
what their actual wage filings
 
03:58:21.650 --> 03:58:21.660 align:start position:0%
um demonstrated based on those two
 
03:58:24.469 --> 03:58:24.479 align:start position:0%
quarters uh follow-up and that is very
 
03:58:25.969 --> 03:58:25.979 align:start position:0%
accurate information
 
03:58:28.010 --> 03:58:28.020 align:start position:0%
would you consider a very very accurate
 
03:58:29.870 --> 03:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
information it's the gold standard of
 
03:58:32.510 --> 03:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
information that we have thank you
 
03:58:35.630 --> 03:58:35.640 align:start position:0%
just a quick clarification question that
 
03:58:38.929 --> 03:58:38.939 align:start position:0%
information though is is it tied to the
 
03:58:41.150 --> 03:58:41.160 align:start position:0%
zip code of the you know where the
 
03:58:43.610 --> 03:58:43.620 align:start position:0%
employee employee leaves or to the zip
 
03:58:46.370 --> 03:58:46.380 align:start position:0%
code of the employer which is what how I
 
03:58:48.050 --> 03:58:48.060 align:start position:0%
think it is because I filed quite quite
 
03:58:50.330 --> 03:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
of those quite a lot of those right
 
03:58:52.490 --> 03:58:52.500 align:start position:0%
because location based location of the
 
03:58:54.410 --> 03:58:54.420 align:start position:0%
employer because technically you do have
 
03:58:56.150 --> 03:58:56.160 align:start position:0%
the social security number of every
 
03:58:58.849 --> 03:58:58.859 align:start position:0%
employee but I don't think you now go
 
03:59:01.849 --> 03:59:01.859 align:start position:0%
and tight how to tie that way so this
 
03:59:04.250 --> 03:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
this data is based on people who work in
 
03:59:06.530 --> 03:59:06.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire not necessarily live in
 
03:59:08.689 --> 03:59:08.699 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire yep just making sure I
 
03:59:10.250 --> 03:59:10.260 align:start position:0%
correctly understand thank you yeah so
 
03:59:12.290 --> 03:59:12.300 align:start position:0%
that that program again it's it's the
 
03:59:15.530 --> 03:59:15.540 align:start position:0%
the quarterly reports filed by the
 
03:59:17.750 --> 03:59:17.760 align:start position:0%
employers that that provide New
 
03:59:19.729 --> 03:59:19.739 align:start position:0%
Hampshire employment and they're
 
03:59:22.429 --> 03:59:22.439 align:start position:0%
required by Statute to report every
 
03:59:22.439 --> 03:59:23.689 align:start position:0%
required by Statute to report every
employee

03:59:23.689 --> 03:59:23.699 align:start position:0%
employee
 
03:59:26.269 --> 03:59:26.279 align:start position:0%
um and that the wages in total that they
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
paid to each of those employees for that
 
03:59:30.650 --> 03:59:30.660 align:start position:0%
quarter and that's what forms the basis
 
03:59:33.410 --> 03:59:33.420 align:start position:0%
of how they they pay their their taxes
 
03:59:34.849 --> 03:59:34.859 align:start position:0%
into the unemployment insurance system
 
03:59:37.670 --> 03:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
which then supports the trust fund out
 
03:59:39.590 --> 03:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
of which benefits get paid so that's
 
03:59:41.750 --> 03:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's the the information that we rely
 
03:59:41.760 --> 03:59:42.769 align:start position:0%
that's the the information that we rely
upon

03:59:42.769 --> 03:59:42.779 align:start position:0%
upon
 
03:59:44.689 --> 03:59:44.699 align:start position:0%
um and and showing that statistic broken
 
03:59:47.570 --> 03:59:47.580 align:start position:0%
down by employment sector to see how
 
03:59:49.610 --> 03:59:49.620 align:start position:0%
employers that fit within each one of
 
03:59:51.650 --> 03:59:51.660 align:start position:0%
those sectors how they've done from a
 
03:59:53.630 --> 03:59:53.640 align:start position:0%
Workforce perspective and that's based
 
03:59:55.550 --> 03:59:55.560 align:start position:0%
on how many workers they're reporting to
 
03:59:59.030 --> 03:59:59.040 align:start position:0%
us they have and comparing that quarter
 
04:00:01.010 --> 04:00:01.020 align:start position:0%
prior to the pandemic in that most
 
04:00:03.469 --> 04:00:03.479 align:start position:0%
recent quarter that we have the data
 
04:00:07.610 --> 04:00:07.620 align:start position:0%
able to be published so that's
 
04:00:09.590 --> 04:00:09.600 align:start position:0%
trying to answer that question sorry if
 
04:00:11.090 --> 04:00:11.100 align:start position:0%
we didn't get there in the most direct
 
04:00:14.809 --> 04:00:14.819 align:start position:0%
route but hopefully we got there
 
04:00:14.819 --> 04:00:16.070 align:start position:0%
route but hopefully we got there
um

04:00:16.070 --> 04:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:00:20.809 --> 04:00:20.819 align:start position:0%
in um turning to the the next
 
04:00:22.189 --> 04:00:22.199 align:start position:0%
um slide
 
04:00:23.990 --> 04:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
um looking at actual continuing to to
 
04:00:26.030 --> 04:00:26.040 align:start position:0%
focus in here on on the health care
 
04:00:28.610 --> 04:00:28.620 align:start position:0%
sector and the and the the difficulties
 
04:00:30.769 --> 04:00:30.779 align:start position:0%
that Healthcare employers are currently
 
04:00:30.779 --> 04:00:32.450 align:start position:0%
that Healthcare employers are currently
experiencing

04:00:32.450 --> 04:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
experiencing
 
04:00:35.330 --> 04:00:35.340 align:start position:0%
um you can see here what their monthly
 
04:00:37.670 --> 04:00:37.680 align:start position:0%
posting activity
 
04:00:40.309 --> 04:00:40.319 align:start position:0%
um looked like for registered nurse
 
04:00:44.510 --> 04:00:44.520 align:start position:0%
positions that were the subject of a job
 
04:00:47.210 --> 04:00:47.220 align:start position:0%
posting for New Hampshire employment and
 
04:00:50.389 --> 04:00:50.399 align:start position:0%
comparing average monthly posting totals
 
04:00:52.630 --> 04:00:52.640 align:start position:0%
for the 2018
 
04:00:57.050 --> 04:00:57.060 align:start position:0%
compared to 2022 and we also do hires as
 
04:00:59.330 --> 04:00:59.340 align:start position:0%
well again this is just solely looking
 
04:01:01.790 --> 04:01:01.800 align:start position:0%
at registered nurses but I think if you
 
04:01:03.889 --> 04:01:03.899 align:start position:0%
if you talk with your with the
 
04:01:05.030 --> 04:01:05.040 align:start position:0%
healthcare employers within your
 
04:01:07.070 --> 04:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
districts they'll tell you that 2018 was
 
04:01:10.670 --> 04:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
difficult they were struggling to fill
 
04:01:14.570 --> 04:01:14.580 align:start position:0%
positions back prior to the pandemic and
 
04:01:16.729 --> 04:01:16.739 align:start position:0%
you can see what the posting activity
 
04:01:19.490 --> 04:01:19.500 align:start position:0%
has actually done over the course of
 
04:01:22.309 --> 04:01:22.319 align:start position:0%
comparing those two years and the demand
 
04:01:25.849 --> 04:01:25.859 align:start position:0%
has increased significantly particularly
 
04:01:28.849 --> 04:01:28.859 align:start position:0%
for our registered nurses and the the
 
04:01:31.070 --> 04:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
actual hires the average monthly hires
 
04:01:34.189 --> 04:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
have actually increased significantly as
 
04:01:40.370 --> 04:01:40.380 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:40.380 --> 04:01:41.389 align:start position:0%
 
um

04:01:41.389 --> 04:01:41.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:01:44.389 --> 04:01:44.399 align:start position:0%
question that's a quick question
 
04:01:46.550 --> 04:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
um pertaining to the job openings are
 
04:01:48.050 --> 04:01:48.060 align:start position:0%
these new openings or these openings
 
04:01:49.849 --> 04:01:49.859 align:start position:0%
because people have left it's a
 
04:01:49.859 --> 04:01:50.990 align:start position:0%
because people have left it's a
combination

04:01:50.990 --> 04:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
combination
 
04:01:52.610 --> 04:01:52.620 align:start position:0%
It's a combination there's a lot of
 
04:01:54.530 --> 04:01:54.540 align:start position:0%
churn in the in that market we have a
 
04:01:56.929 --> 04:01:56.939 align:start position:0%
whole presentation on
 
04:01:59.570 --> 04:01:59.580 align:start position:0%
um issues related to health care uh
 
04:02:01.309 --> 04:02:01.319 align:start position:0%
Workforce and one of the things
 
04:02:03.889 --> 04:02:03.899 align:start position:0%
particular to the registered nurses that
 
04:02:07.070 --> 04:02:07.080 align:start position:0%
we didn't put in this presentation but
 
04:02:08.809 --> 04:02:08.819 align:start position:0%
the fact that there's much greater
 
04:02:10.969 --> 04:02:10.979 align:start position:0%
competition for registered nurses coming
 
04:02:14.210 --> 04:02:14.220 align:start position:0%
not only from hospitals and and nursing
 
04:02:16.610 --> 04:02:16.620 align:start position:0%
and Residential Care Facilities but also
 
04:02:19.130 --> 04:02:19.140 align:start position:0%
from other Industries we know that the
 
04:02:21.889 --> 04:02:21.899 align:start position:0%
retail industry for instance the Walmart
 
04:02:25.610 --> 04:02:25.620 align:start position:0%
CVS targets are opening Health Care some
 
04:02:27.530 --> 04:02:27.540 align:start position:0%
sort of Health Care Facilities they
 
04:02:30.229 --> 04:02:30.239 align:start position:0%
become attractive places to work for
 
04:02:32.330 --> 04:02:32.340 align:start position:0%
many of these individuals so there's
 
04:02:35.450 --> 04:02:35.460 align:start position:0%
increasing competition there and there
 
04:02:38.150 --> 04:02:38.160 align:start position:0%
was following the pandemic a fair amount
 
04:02:40.370 --> 04:02:40.380 align:start position:0%
of people who left the profession so
 
04:02:43.729 --> 04:02:43.739 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of churn in and one
 
04:02:46.130 --> 04:02:46.140 align:start position:0%
of the biggest sources of competition is
 
04:02:46.140 --> 04:02:47.290 align:start position:0%
of the biggest sources of competition is
from

04:02:47.290 --> 04:02:47.300 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:02:50.929 --> 04:02:50.939 align:start position:0%
employment agencies that hire nurses for
 
04:02:54.229 --> 04:02:54.239 align:start position:0%
traveling as traveling nurses a big
 
04:02:56.570 --> 04:02:56.580 align:start position:0%
issue and the wage differential there
 
04:02:58.370 --> 04:02:58.380 align:start position:0%
may be three times what they might make
 
04:03:00.769 --> 04:03:00.779 align:start position:0%
working at a hospital so there's a whole
 
04:03:02.210 --> 04:03:02.220 align:start position:0%
host of things that are contributing to
 
04:03:04.849 --> 04:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
that elevation of the uh of the job
 
04:03:04.859 --> 04:03:08.510 align:start position:0%
that elevation of the uh of the job
openings

04:03:08.510 --> 04:03:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:11.750 --> 04:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
would you say that the impact of the
 
04:03:14.389 --> 04:03:14.399 align:start position:0%
shift to traveling nurses is more of a
 
04:03:18.070 --> 04:03:18.080 align:start position:0%
temporary shift due to the pandemic and
 
04:03:21.469 --> 04:03:21.479 align:start position:0%
we expect to see stuff coming back to
 
04:03:23.389 --> 04:03:23.399 align:start position:0%
more or do you feel it's a permanent
 
04:03:25.189 --> 04:03:25.199 align:start position:0%
Trend now that the pandemic opened the
 
04:03:26.809 --> 04:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
flood gates because it seems very
 
04:03:28.670 --> 04:03:28.680 align:start position:0%
difficult to justify as an employer
 
04:03:31.070 --> 04:03:31.080 align:start position:0%
paying somebody three times more to hire
 
04:03:34.010 --> 04:03:34.020 align:start position:0%
them as a temporary person so I'm just
 
04:03:35.210 --> 04:03:35.220 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what are your
 
04:03:38.450 --> 04:03:38.460 align:start position:0%
thoughts on the you know the the reality
 
04:03:40.550 --> 04:03:40.560 align:start position:0%
is I think in talking to some employers
 
04:03:42.410 --> 04:03:42.420 align:start position:0%
hospitals in particular is that they
 
04:03:44.030 --> 04:03:44.040 align:start position:0%
don't have a choice if they want to
 
04:03:46.429 --> 04:03:46.439 align:start position:0%
provide the care they have to they have
 
04:03:48.050 --> 04:03:48.060 align:start position:0%
to have the nurses in order to provide
 
04:03:50.210 --> 04:03:50.220 align:start position:0%
the care so they will do what they have
 
04:03:53.330 --> 04:03:53.340 align:start position:0%
to do in order to get that Staffing and
 
04:03:56.689 --> 04:03:56.699 align:start position:0%
that means hiring a temporary or a
 
04:03:59.210 --> 04:03:59.220 align:start position:0%
traveling nurse at three times so
 
04:04:02.570 --> 04:04:02.580 align:start position:0%
um and from a nurse's perspective it's
 
04:04:04.670 --> 04:04:04.680 align:start position:0%
got to be very difficult to give up that
 
04:04:06.849 --> 04:04:06.859 align:start position:0%
increase in wages so
 
04:04:09.349 --> 04:04:09.359 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a spy it's a kind of a
 
04:04:12.530 --> 04:04:12.540 align:start position:0%
spiraling effect and it's an arms race
 
04:04:15.410 --> 04:04:15.420 align:start position:0%
um you need the you need the staff they
 
04:04:17.510 --> 04:04:17.520 align:start position:0%
want the money and at some point
 
04:04:20.990 --> 04:04:21.000 align:start position:0%
something has gotta Gotta Give there I I
 
04:04:23.510 --> 04:04:23.520 align:start position:0%
I can understand that as at this point
 
04:04:25.370 --> 04:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
in time but again in the long term that
 
04:04:27.170 --> 04:04:27.180 align:start position:0%
does not seem to be sustainable because
 
04:04:28.729 --> 04:04:28.739 align:start position:0%
of that huge gap you would expect
 
04:04:32.389 --> 04:04:32.399 align:start position:0%
employers to start increasing wages to
 
04:04:35.630 --> 04:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
get somebody you know as a full-time but
 
04:04:37.849 --> 04:04:37.859 align:start position:0%
still not pay anywhere near the uh
 
04:04:39.889 --> 04:04:39.899 align:start position:0%
that's why I was asking more of a long
 
04:04:41.750 --> 04:04:41.760 align:start position:0%
term what kind of shifts do you expect
 
04:04:43.729 --> 04:04:43.739 align:start position:0%
because it does impact how this issue
 
04:04:46.130 --> 04:04:46.140 align:start position:0%
one of the issues that complicates it
 
04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
particularly for hospitals one of the
 
04:04:50.809 --> 04:04:50.819 align:start position:0%
industries that saw the biggest decline
 
04:04:53.689 --> 04:04:53.699 align:start position:0%
where ambulatory Ambulatory Care
 
04:04:56.630 --> 04:04:56.640 align:start position:0%
Facilities didn't see that decline one
 
04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:58.560 align:start position:0%
of the big differences between hospitals
 
04:04:59.990 --> 04:05:00.000 align:start position:0%
and nursing and Residential Care
 
04:05:02.809 --> 04:05:02.819 align:start position:0%
Facilities as opposed to Ambulatory Care
 
04:05:06.110 --> 04:05:06.120 align:start position:0%
is their patience and who's dependent on
 
04:05:08.990 --> 04:05:09.000 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so hospitals a lot of our
 
04:05:10.790 --> 04:05:10.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals have an obligation to provide
 
04:05:13.010 --> 04:05:13.020 align:start position:0%
care they provide a greater percentage
 
04:05:16.429 --> 04:05:16.439 align:start position:0%
of care to Medicaid recipients so their
 
04:05:18.229 --> 04:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
revenue is a is a little bit more
 
04:05:20.570 --> 04:05:20.580 align:start position:0%
constrained so they have a difficulty in
 
04:05:23.990 --> 04:05:24.000 align:start position:0%
raising their wages in the same way that
 
04:05:26.510 --> 04:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
say a staffing agency who can then hire
 
04:05:29.929 --> 04:05:29.939 align:start position:0%
out that that individual so there's a
 
04:05:32.450 --> 04:05:32.460 align:start position:0%
lot of complicating issues involved in
 
04:05:34.250 --> 04:05:34.260 align:start position:0%
this I appreciate I appreciate the
 
04:05:37.010 --> 04:05:37.020 align:start position:0%
Insight it's very uh educational thank
 
04:05:41.389 --> 04:05:41.399 align:start position:0%
you I agree it is really a critical need
 
04:05:44.630 --> 04:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
my question is insurance companies are
 
04:05:46.550 --> 04:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
making millions and millions of dollars
 
04:05:49.729 --> 04:05:49.739 align:start position:0%
why don't they fund this process and not
 
04:05:53.090 --> 04:05:53.100 align:start position:0%
take it away from our college students
 
04:05:56.689 --> 04:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry to do that to you I apologize
 
04:05:59.150 --> 04:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
but I couldn't contain myself is there
 
04:06:00.849 --> 04:06:00.859 align:start position:0%
an insurance lobbyist
 
04:06:04.550 --> 04:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
and and representative we get to we get
 
04:06:06.889 --> 04:06:06.899 align:start position:0%
to provide you more information to make
 
04:06:08.389 --> 04:06:08.399 align:start position:0%
to make what we hope are better
 
04:06:10.309 --> 04:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
decisions but we'll leave those policy
 
04:06:11.929 --> 04:06:11.939 align:start position:0%
decisions to you
 
04:06:16.429 --> 04:06:16.439 align:start position:0%
but it just continuing on on some of the
 
04:06:19.189 --> 04:06:19.199 align:start position:0%
when we try to really Define the problem
 
04:06:21.530 --> 04:06:21.540 align:start position:0%
and we're working with some Health Care
 
04:06:21.540 --> 04:06:23.150 align:start position:0%
and we're working with some Health Care
Workforce

04:06:23.150 --> 04:06:23.160 align:start position:0%
Workforce
 
04:06:25.250 --> 04:06:25.260 align:start position:0%
um initiatives in the state so we're
 
04:06:26.809 --> 04:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
really trying to
 
04:06:28.610 --> 04:06:28.620 align:start position:0%
find out exactly what the issue is
 
04:06:30.650 --> 04:06:30.660 align:start position:0%
because if we just say there's a problem
 
04:06:32.389 --> 04:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
with the workforce and health care it's
 
04:06:33.830 --> 04:06:33.840 align:start position:0%
pretty nebulous we don't know what to do
 
04:06:35.929 --> 04:06:35.939 align:start position:0%
so we've really narrowed it down more
 
04:06:37.969 --> 04:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
toward the biggest issue is on in the
 
04:06:39.830 --> 04:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
nursing side problem everywhere but
 
04:06:41.689 --> 04:06:41.699 align:start position:0%
nurses is seems to be the most
 
04:06:44.929 --> 04:06:44.939 align:start position:0%
problematic one issue related to that is
 
04:06:47.630 --> 04:06:47.640 align:start position:0%
the fact on the next chart is that we
 
04:06:50.750 --> 04:06:50.760 align:start position:0%
lose a lot of nurses who commute out of
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
state they commute out of state in
 
04:06:55.189 --> 04:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
particular to Massachusetts Rockingham
 
04:06:58.330 --> 04:06:58.340 align:start position:0%
County loses on a daily basis about 1200
 
04:07:00.290 --> 04:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
registered nurses in commute
 
04:07:02.090 --> 04:07:02.100 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts question
 
04:07:04.729 --> 04:07:04.739 align:start position:0%
um there there's one County in New
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that sees an influx and that's
 
04:07:08.030 --> 04:07:08.040 align:start position:0%
Grafton County largely related to
 
04:07:10.849 --> 04:07:10.859 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth Mary Hitchcock
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
um so that's very problematic and one of
 
04:07:15.229 --> 04:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
the reasons why we believe that's so
 
04:07:17.330 --> 04:07:17.340 align:start position:0%
problematic is the next slide which is
 
04:07:20.150 --> 04:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
the wage differential
 
04:07:23.570 --> 04:07:23.580 align:start position:0%
um this is shows wages median earnings
 
04:07:25.849 --> 04:07:25.859 align:start position:0%
at the 10th the 25th percentile the
 
04:07:28.910 --> 04:07:28.920 align:start position:0%
median 75th and 90th so
 
04:07:31.250 --> 04:07:31.260 align:start position:0%
nurses when they come out of school it's
 
04:07:33.290 --> 04:07:33.300 align:start position:0%
generally not a big difference between
 
04:07:36.469 --> 04:07:36.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire but as
 
04:07:38.689 --> 04:07:38.699 align:start position:0%
they become more experienced they have
 
04:07:41.030 --> 04:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
more more time in the profession the
 
04:07:43.790 --> 04:07:43.800 align:start position:0%
wage differential gets dramatically
 
04:07:47.090 --> 04:07:47.100 align:start position:0%
different so uh basically equal at the
 
04:07:49.370 --> 04:07:49.380 align:start position:0%
10th percentile individuals starting out
 
04:07:52.429 --> 04:07:52.439 align:start position:0%
but almost fifty thousand dollars when
 
04:07:55.610 --> 04:07:55.620 align:start position:0%
you get the most experience so it
 
04:07:57.469 --> 04:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
becomes a real
 
04:08:01.309 --> 04:08:01.319 align:start position:0%
um compelling economic uh argument for
 
04:08:03.469 --> 04:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
many of those individuals to work out of
 
04:08:03.479 --> 04:08:07.450 align:start position:0%
many of those individuals to work out of
state

04:08:07.450 --> 04:08:07.460 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:10.010 --> 04:08:10.020 align:start position:0%
do you have an idea why because we're
 
04:08:12.050 --> 04:08:12.060 align:start position:0%
talking mostly private employers if we
 
04:08:14.150 --> 04:08:14.160 align:start position:0%
were talking about government you know
 
04:08:16.849 --> 04:08:16.859 align:start position:0%
employees I would totally uh see a
 
04:08:18.290 --> 04:08:18.300 align:start position:0%
difference in philosophy between
 
04:08:20.389 --> 04:08:20.399 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and New Hampshire but
 
04:08:22.670 --> 04:08:22.680 align:start position:0%
since those are private employers is is
 
04:08:25.010 --> 04:08:25.020 align:start position:0%
it coming back to the same Medicaid does
 
04:08:27.710 --> 04:08:27.720 align:start position:0%
you know why do you think this Gap
 
04:08:29.990 --> 04:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
exists because of some of it is cost of
 
04:08:32.030 --> 04:08:32.040 align:start position:0%
living but it seems too big for that
 
04:08:34.729 --> 04:08:34.739 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean this is not unique to this
 
04:08:37.849 --> 04:08:37.859 align:start position:0%
profession I would say
 
04:08:39.769 --> 04:08:39.779 align:start position:0%
um in looking at waste differentials
 
04:08:41.590 --> 04:08:41.600 align:start position:0%
between New Hampshire and Massachusetts
 
04:08:45.229 --> 04:08:45.239 align:start position:0%
uh this is one of the more substantial
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
differences and I think some of it has
 
04:08:49.189 --> 04:08:49.199 align:start position:0%
to do with the many opportunities and
 
04:08:50.570 --> 04:08:50.580 align:start position:0%
the greater particularly the Greater
 
04:08:53.090 --> 04:08:53.100 align:start position:0%
Boston metro area you know it is a it is
 
04:08:54.590 --> 04:08:54.600 align:start position:0%
one of the centers for health care
 
04:08:57.349 --> 04:08:57.359 align:start position:0%
services in the world so there's many
 
04:08:58.729 --> 04:08:58.739 align:start position:0%
more opportunities some of the best
 
04:09:00.769 --> 04:09:00.779 align:start position:0%
hospitals are are in the Boston metro
 
04:09:03.650 --> 04:09:03.660 align:start position:0%
area so I think that contributes their
 
04:09:05.929 --> 04:09:05.939 align:start position:0%
revenues I'm sure are you know more
 
04:09:09.130 --> 04:09:09.140 align:start position:0%
substantial there probably initially
 
04:09:11.929 --> 04:09:11.939 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of thinking that it is
 
04:09:13.550 --> 04:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
cheaper to live in New Hampshire it is
 
04:09:15.110 --> 04:09:15.120 align:start position:0%
cheaper to live in New Hampshire than it
 
04:09:16.610 --> 04:09:16.620 align:start position:0%
is to live in Massachusetts but that Gap
 
04:09:19.309 --> 04:09:19.319 align:start position:0%
has narrowed dramatically
 
04:09:22.070 --> 04:09:22.080 align:start position:0%
um and and I and the next chart I just
 
04:09:25.010 --> 04:09:25.020 align:start position:0%
tried to adjust that median wage or cost
 
04:09:27.950 --> 04:09:27.960 align:start position:0%
of living so you see median annual wages
 
04:09:31.130 --> 04:09:31.140 align:start position:0%
for registered nurses if you just take
 
04:09:34.849 --> 04:09:34.859 align:start position:0%
the the nominal wage pretty substantial
 
04:09:34.859 --> 04:09:36.349 align:start position:0%
the the nominal wage pretty substantial
15

04:09:36.349 --> 04:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
15
 
04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
000 difference you just for cost of
 
04:09:41.570 --> 04:09:41.580 align:start position:0%
living between the two states that Gap
 
04:09:44.450 --> 04:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
Narrows pretty substantially
 
04:09:48.110 --> 04:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
but on the far bars the far ones there
 
04:09:50.809 --> 04:09:50.819 align:start position:0%
is what happens if you live in New
 
04:09:52.969 --> 04:09:52.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and you work in Massachusetts
 
04:09:56.330 --> 04:09:56.340 align:start position:0%
as a registered nurse then the then it
 
04:09:58.729 --> 04:09:58.739 align:start position:0%
becomes very compelling then it's a
 
04:10:01.070 --> 04:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
um you know that's the that's the The
 
04:10:04.490 --> 04:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
Sweet Spot if you want to maximize your
 
04:10:07.429 --> 04:10:07.439 align:start position:0%
spendable income or by reducing your
 
04:10:09.349 --> 04:10:09.359 align:start position:0%
cost of living and maximizing your
 
04:10:09.359 --> 04:10:10.670 align:start position:0%
cost of living and maximizing your
earnings

04:10:10.670 --> 04:10:10.680 align:start position:0%
earnings
 
04:10:13.250 --> 04:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
um and there's no incentive which is the
 
04:10:15.189 --> 04:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
blue line for somebody in Massachusetts
 
04:10:18.349 --> 04:10:18.359 align:start position:0%
to work in New Hampshire to live in
 
04:10:19.849 --> 04:10:19.859 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and work in New Hampshire
 
04:10:22.429 --> 04:10:22.439 align:start position:0%
which though which leads to my the
 
04:10:27.290 --> 04:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:29.990 --> 04:10:30.000 align:start position:0%
if those people are people who moved to
 
04:10:32.330 --> 04:10:32.340 align:start position:0%
the Greater Boston area because of jobs
 
04:10:34.490 --> 04:10:34.500 align:start position:0%
in Boston and they just choose to live
 
04:10:37.189 --> 04:10:37.199 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire because frankly besides
 
04:10:38.990 --> 04:10:39.000 align:start position:0%
the financial impact I can assure you
 
04:10:40.670 --> 04:10:40.680 align:start position:0%
that when I moved from Massachusetts to
 
04:10:42.530 --> 04:10:42.540 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire it was not just costly
 
04:10:45.170 --> 04:10:45.180 align:start position:0%
living okay well keep it a political and
 
04:10:47.030 --> 04:10:47.040 align:start position:0%
leave it at that but
 
04:10:48.769 --> 04:10:48.779 align:start position:0%
this being said
 
04:10:51.410 --> 04:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
is there any amount of money that we can
 
04:10:52.729 --> 04:10:52.739 align:start position:0%
offer them to actually work in New
 
04:10:54.590 --> 04:10:54.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire when they came for Boston they
 
04:10:56.570 --> 04:10:56.580 align:start position:0%
want to work in Boston they just commute
 
04:10:58.189 --> 04:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
there I I'm just trying to understand
 
04:11:01.070 --> 04:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
how much we can benefit and how much can
 
04:11:04.070 --> 04:11:04.080 align:start position:0%
we expect to return because that whole
 
04:11:05.750 --> 04:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
everybody wants to work in Cambridge
 
04:11:07.910 --> 04:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
same thing happens with biotechs my wife
 
04:11:11.030 --> 04:11:11.040 align:start position:0%
is in biotech you cannot start a biotech
 
04:11:12.650 --> 04:11:12.660 align:start position:0%
outside of Cambridge because everybody's
 
04:11:14.689 --> 04:11:14.699 align:start position:0%
already there and it's it's a huge
 
04:11:16.910 --> 04:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
self-reinforcing effect how much of that
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
applies to the healthcare industry and
 
04:11:20.389 --> 04:11:20.399 align:start position:0%
how much can we actually change those
 
04:11:22.790 --> 04:11:22.800 align:start position:0%
decisions in our favor well I think this
 
04:11:26.150 --> 04:11:26.160 align:start position:0%
proposal is one effort to do that and if
 
04:11:27.410 --> 04:11:27.420 align:start position:0%
I can take you through a couple of
 
04:11:29.389 --> 04:11:29.399 align:start position:0%
slides we'll try to answer something
 
04:11:31.550 --> 04:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
because that that's one of the things
 
04:11:33.950 --> 04:11:33.960 align:start position:0%
how much will this make a difference or
 
04:11:35.450 --> 04:11:35.460 align:start position:0%
conceivably could it make a difference
 
04:11:39.410 --> 04:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
so the next chart has a slide that shows
 
04:11:43.130 --> 04:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
that the median debt for graduates from
 
04:11:46.990 --> 04:11:47.000 align:start position:0%
nursing programs that I I picked as many
 
04:11:49.630 --> 04:11:49.640 align:start position:0%
colleges in New Hampshire that actually
 
04:11:52.729 --> 04:11:52.739 align:start position:0%
I could fit on this conveniently there's
 
04:11:54.469 --> 04:11:54.479 align:start position:0%
actually more collagens that offer but
 
04:11:56.389 --> 04:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly narrow range in terms
 
04:11:58.729 --> 04:11:58.739 align:start position:0%
of the average or the median debt of
 
04:12:00.769 --> 04:12:00.779 align:start position:0%
that somebody who graduates with either
 
04:12:05.450 --> 04:12:05.460 align:start position:0%
an Associates or a bachelor's degree so
 
04:12:08.150 --> 04:12:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's not including any debt that they
 
04:12:09.769 --> 04:12:09.779 align:start position:0%
may have incurred at a previous school
 
04:12:12.229 --> 04:12:12.239 align:start position:0%
if they switch schools it's just the
 
04:12:15.170 --> 04:12:15.180 align:start position:0%
debt from and it doesn't include any
 
04:12:17.450 --> 04:12:17.460 align:start position:0%
non-federal debt so private loans not
 
04:12:19.130 --> 04:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
included here so they may have
 
04:12:20.990 --> 04:12:21.000 align:start position:0%
additional debt
 
04:12:23.389 --> 04:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
so that's what we're looking at in terms
 
04:12:25.670 --> 04:12:25.680 align:start position:0%
of individuals so let's take a look at
 
04:12:29.030 --> 04:12:29.040 align:start position:0%
what happens get back if I may get back
 
04:12:31.130 --> 04:12:31.140 align:start position:0%
to your previous slide we're uh we're
 
04:12:33.290 --> 04:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
talking about the migration or the
 
04:12:36.050 --> 04:12:36.060 align:start position:0%
working in Massachusetts do you see a
 
04:12:40.309 --> 04:12:40.319 align:start position:0%
trend coming our way at all no or is it
 
04:12:42.410 --> 04:12:42.420 align:start position:0%
getting worse I think I've seen a I
 
04:12:44.689 --> 04:12:44.699 align:start position:0%
think it was 102 000 people a day across
 
04:12:46.790 --> 04:12:46.800 align:start position:0%
the border to work across borders yeah
 
04:12:48.590 --> 04:12:48.600 align:start position:0%
uh you know that's been fairly
 
04:12:50.389 --> 04:12:50.399 align:start position:0%
consistent with
 
04:12:51.590 --> 04:12:51.600 align:start position:0%
um the number who commute to
 
04:12:53.570 --> 04:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts from New Hampshire we do
 
04:12:57.710 --> 04:12:57.720 align:start position:0%
receive a small numbers from Vermont and
 
04:13:00.050 --> 04:13:00.060 align:start position:0%
Maine who commute into New Hampshire but
 
04:13:03.410 --> 04:13:03.420 align:start position:0%
on net there's about 40 000 who commute
 
04:13:06.590 --> 04:13:06.600 align:start position:0%
in from Massachusetts and about a
 
04:13:09.349 --> 04:13:09.359 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand who commute out so we
 
04:13:11.570 --> 04:13:11.580 align:start position:0%
we're a net exporter of Labor so it's
 
04:13:13.610 --> 04:13:13.620 align:start position:0%
forty thousand net yeah we're a net
 
04:13:15.290 --> 04:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
exporter of labor but and this
 
04:13:17.450 --> 04:13:17.460 align:start position:0%
particular occupation and if you if you
 
04:13:19.309 --> 04:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
look at different occupations this is an
 
04:13:22.250 --> 04:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
occupant one where we are a net exporter
 
04:13:25.010 --> 04:13:25.020 align:start position:0%
of of of nurses to Massachusetts
 
04:13:27.530 --> 04:13:27.540 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts Imports nurses from a lot
 
04:13:29.570 --> 04:13:29.580 align:start position:0%
of places by the way on a daily basis
 
04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
about 3 600 nurses who live outside of
 
04:13:34.849 --> 04:13:34.859 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts commute into Massachusetts
 
04:13:37.969 --> 04:13:37.979 align:start position:0%
for work so they are a draw and that's
 
04:13:39.650 --> 04:13:39.660 align:start position:0%
our that's a competition because we're a
 
04:13:41.269 --> 04:13:41.279 align:start position:0%
regional labor market and I can tell you
 
04:13:43.429 --> 04:13:43.439 align:start position:0%
uh I had a person that was in a
 
04:13:43.439 --> 04:13:44.469 align:start position:0%
uh I had a person that was in a
Massachusetts

04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts
 
04:13:47.750 --> 04:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
and uh one nurse was covering three
 
04:13:50.929 --> 04:13:50.939 align:start position:0%
floors and I mean she was right out
 
04:13:53.090 --> 04:13:53.100 align:start position:0%
straight I mean it it was unbelievable
 
04:13:55.849 --> 04:13:55.859 align:start position:0%
so I mean it's it's a problem everywhere
 
04:13:57.110 --> 04:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
I guess
 
04:13:57.120 --> 04:13:58.490 align:start position:0%
I guess
so

04:13:58.490 --> 04:13:58.500 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:14:01.309 --> 04:14:01.319 align:start position:0%
um let's just take one and it's kind of
 
04:14:04.250 --> 04:14:04.260 align:start position:0%
exactly how this would play out in terms
 
04:14:07.070 --> 04:14:07.080 align:start position:0%
of making or helping to adjust that
 
04:14:10.429 --> 04:14:10.439 align:start position:0%
differential so we have the median
 
04:14:12.830 --> 04:14:12.840 align:start position:0%
annual earnings six seventy six thousand
 
04:14:14.870 --> 04:14:14.880 align:start position:0%
nine hundred versus ninety one thousand
 
04:14:17.030 --> 04:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
when it's adjusted for cost of living
 
04:14:20.330 --> 04:14:20.340 align:start position:0%
this is you have 63 it gets narrowed so
 
04:14:22.370 --> 04:14:22.380 align:start position:0%
what happens if loan forgiveness that
 
04:14:24.710 --> 04:14:24.720 align:start position:0%
kind of the average or median level of
 
04:14:28.450 --> 04:14:28.460 align:start position:0%
debt 27.5 or so the median level of debt
 
04:14:31.610 --> 04:14:31.620 align:start position:0%
and assume as I did there's a lot of
 
04:14:34.010 --> 04:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
assumptions here 10-year payback period
 
04:14:37.330 --> 04:14:37.340 align:start position:0%
six percent interest rate that equals
 
04:14:41.030 --> 04:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
305 dollars a month so just add that
 
04:14:43.130 --> 04:14:43.140 align:start position:0%
back in I mean they're not getting that
 
04:14:46.070 --> 04:14:46.080 align:start position:0%
money per se but if they're avoiding
 
04:14:50.269 --> 04:14:50.279 align:start position:0%
having to pay that that equals 30
 
04:14:52.550 --> 04:14:52.560 align:start position:0%
six thousand thirty six hundred dollars
 
04:14:55.010 --> 04:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
a year so we kind of add that back into
 
04:14:58.010 --> 04:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
their um you know the equation and it
 
04:14:59.570 --> 04:14:59.580 align:start position:0%
Narrows that differential pretty
 
04:15:01.010 --> 04:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
significantly the other way you could
 
04:15:03.469 --> 04:15:03.479 align:start position:0%
look at it is after three years you get
 
04:15:05.330 --> 04:15:05.340 align:start position:0%
a lump sum payment they've paid off lump
 
04:15:08.210 --> 04:15:08.220 align:start position:0%
sum payment it would equal 21
 
04:15:08.220 --> 04:15:10.250 align:start position:0%
sum payment it would equal 21
000.50

04:15:10.250 --> 04:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
000.50
 
04:15:10.260 --> 04:15:11.870 align:start position:0%
000.50
so

04:15:11.870 --> 04:15:11.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:15:14.809 --> 04:15:14.819 align:start position:0%
is Eric obviously we're in competition
 
04:15:16.910 --> 04:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
with these other states is there a plan
 
04:15:19.790 --> 04:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
like this in Massachusetts
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
to attract our our Workforce we don't
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
need it well I mean but it no but it it
 
04:15:27.229 --> 04:15:27.239 align:start position:0%
you know we're we're going back and
 
04:15:29.809 --> 04:15:29.819 align:start position:0%
forth here I mean this is a big problem
 
04:15:32.150 --> 04:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
I mean there's no there's no kids being
 
04:15:35.090 --> 04:15:35.100 align:start position:0%
born so that's what you get I mean we're
 
04:15:40.670 --> 04:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
we've lost uh what 221 160 uh 160 000 uh
 
04:15:43.130 --> 04:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
public school students and I mean you
 
04:15:47.330 --> 04:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:15:50.330 --> 04:15:50.340 align:start position:0%
um and I I know that uh um the
 
04:15:51.650 --> 04:15:51.660 align:start position:0%
governor's office had looked at has
 
04:15:53.689 --> 04:15:53.699 align:start position:0%
looked at that I'm going to deferred to
 
04:15:56.929 --> 04:15:56.939 align:start position:0%
to Adam crapo on that I'm not aware of
 
04:15:56.939 --> 04:15:58.790 align:start position:0%
to Adam crapo on that I'm not aware of
any

04:15:58.790 --> 04:15:58.800 align:start position:0%
any
 
04:16:00.950 --> 04:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
programs over there I I couldn't
 
04:16:02.150 --> 04:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
identify it doesn't mean there aren't
 
04:16:04.849 --> 04:16:04.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:16:06.769 --> 04:16:06.779 align:start position:0%
specifically for this
 
04:16:09.650 --> 04:16:09.660 align:start position:0%
okay so so I think our our
 
04:16:11.809 --> 04:16:11.819 align:start position:0%
um objective here was we wanted to share
 
04:16:13.550 --> 04:16:13.560 align:start position:0%
the the additional information that we
 
04:16:16.309 --> 04:16:16.319 align:start position:0%
had provided to your colleagues on the
 
04:16:17.929 --> 04:16:17.939 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee
 
04:16:19.429 --> 04:16:19.439 align:start position:0%
um that that
 
04:16:23.210 --> 04:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
pinpoint the or try to help better
 
04:16:25.189 --> 04:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
understand the issues that our
 
04:16:28.610 --> 04:16:28.620 align:start position:0%
Healthcare employers are are talking to
 
04:16:30.530 --> 04:16:30.540 align:start position:0%
all of us about
 
04:16:31.929 --> 04:16:31.939 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:16:34.750 --> 04:16:34.760 align:start position:0%
also demonstrating
 
04:16:39.290 --> 04:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
what can happen when you create some
 
04:16:43.130 --> 04:16:43.140 align:start position:0%
incentives like that proposed here in
 
04:16:46.269 --> 04:16:46.279 align:start position:0%
hb2 with the student loan debt relief
 
04:16:49.210 --> 04:16:49.220 align:start position:0%
when you create some incentives that can
 
04:16:49.220 --> 04:16:50.830 align:start position:0%
when you create some incentives that can
differentiate

04:16:50.830 --> 04:16:50.840 align:start position:0%
differentiate
 
04:16:55.189 --> 04:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
the state amongst our neighbors and
 
04:16:56.990 --> 04:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
trying to keep some of those nurses that
 
04:16:58.610 --> 04:16:58.620 align:start position:0%
were that we're losing right now
 
04:17:00.830 --> 04:17:00.840 align:start position:0%
particularly from Rockingham County that
 
04:17:02.450 --> 04:17:02.460 align:start position:0%
are traveling to Massachusetts to work
 
04:17:04.729 --> 04:17:04.739 align:start position:0%
trying to keep them here trying to pull
 
04:17:06.349 --> 04:17:06.359 align:start position:0%
in others and trying to keep them here
 
04:17:09.889 --> 04:17:09.899 align:start position:0%
so hopefully the information was helpful
 
04:17:12.290 --> 04:17:12.300 align:start position:0%
all right thank you and thank you that
 
04:17:15.170 --> 04:17:15.180 align:start position:0%
was really good um but I'd like to know
 
04:17:17.750 --> 04:17:17.760 align:start position:0%
if I could hear from um Deb scary who's
 
04:17:20.630 --> 04:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
the executive director of um the uh
 
04:17:23.330 --> 04:17:23.340 align:start position:0%
before you go I have one one oh okay I'm
 
04:17:23.340 --> 04:17:25.309 align:start position:0%
before you go I have one one oh okay I'm
sorry

04:17:25.309 --> 04:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:17:27.349 --> 04:17:27.359 align:start position:0%
yeah this is a little tangential but
 
04:17:28.670 --> 04:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
you're talking about you know the
 
04:17:31.550 --> 04:17:31.560 align:start position:0%
competition around this and there was a
 
04:17:33.050 --> 04:17:33.060 align:start position:0%
um a move towards I guess Boutique
 
04:17:34.550 --> 04:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
Medical Care
 
04:17:37.189 --> 04:17:37.199 align:start position:0%
um is that and the numbers must be small
 
04:17:39.229 --> 04:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
but do you see that growing or is that
 
04:17:41.750 --> 04:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
kind of fading away
 
04:17:44.510 --> 04:17:44.520 align:start position:0%
um with Boutique Medical Care
 
04:17:46.670 --> 04:17:46.680 align:start position:0%
um if you're referring to more of the
 
04:17:49.070 --> 04:17:49.080 align:start position:0%
kind of the ambulatory care so
 
04:17:51.710 --> 04:17:51.720 align:start position:0%
ambulatory surgical centers
 
04:17:54.469 --> 04:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
um they've from a conductor offices yeah
 
04:17:56.269 --> 04:17:56.279 align:start position:0%
from from a Workforce perspective
 
04:18:00.650 --> 04:18:00.660 align:start position:0%
Ambulatory Care grown significantly
 
04:18:03.050 --> 04:18:03.060 align:start position:0%
um you know they're up 1100 employees
 
04:18:05.210 --> 04:18:05.220 align:start position:0%
compared to pre-pandemic when your your
 
04:18:07.309 --> 04:18:07.319 align:start position:0%
Hospital's in your long-term care are
 
04:18:10.670 --> 04:18:10.680 align:start position:0%
each down about 1100 down 1300
 
04:18:13.309 --> 04:18:13.319 align:start position:0%
respectively so Ambulatory Care is doing
 
04:18:15.530 --> 04:18:15.540 align:start position:0%
is in a much different position from a
 
04:18:18.050 --> 04:18:18.060 align:start position:0%
Workforce perspective yeah so that's
 
04:18:21.349 --> 04:18:21.359 align:start position:0%
good for them not so good for public
 
04:18:28.510 --> 04:18:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:30.290 --> 04:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
not-for-profit hospitals probably
 
04:18:32.809 --> 04:18:32.819 align:start position:0%
struggle most with that issue
 
04:18:34.910 --> 04:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
because a lot of their revenue has been
 
04:18:37.670 --> 04:18:37.680 align:start position:0%
siphoned they have an obligation for uh
 
04:18:39.889 --> 04:18:39.899 align:start position:0%
to provide care and so it becomes
 
04:18:44.389 --> 04:18:44.399 align:start position:0%
problematic we brought we kind of
 
04:18:46.550 --> 04:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
control the certificate of need process
 
04:18:49.550 --> 04:18:49.560 align:start position:0%
that was preventing ambulatory surgical
 
04:18:51.410 --> 04:18:51.420 align:start position:0%
centers they would they were clamping
 
04:18:53.630 --> 04:18:53.640 align:start position:0%
down on them and we kind of stopped them
 
04:18:55.849 --> 04:18:55.859 align:start position:0%
from doing that
 
04:18:57.530 --> 04:18:57.540 align:start position:0%
just a quick follow-up since
 
04:18:59.450 --> 04:18:59.460 align:start position:0%
representative Murray brought the
 
04:19:00.769 --> 04:19:00.779 align:start position:0%
thought to my mind when she asked about
 
04:19:02.870 --> 04:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
Boutique stuff
 
04:19:06.110 --> 04:19:06.120 align:start position:0%
um On a related topic uh there is there
 
04:19:07.610 --> 04:19:07.620 align:start position:0%
is a topic that keeps coming up about
 
04:19:09.590 --> 04:19:09.600 align:start position:0%
direct contribution you know uh medical
 
04:19:12.170 --> 04:19:12.180 align:start position:0%
doctors that don't build insurance but
 
04:19:13.790 --> 04:19:13.800 align:start position:0%
the patients build them directly and
 
04:19:15.769 --> 04:19:15.779 align:start position:0%
then deal with that do we see any of
 
04:19:18.410 --> 04:19:18.420 align:start position:0%
that if so does it have any uh impact on
 
04:19:20.389 --> 04:19:20.399 align:start position:0%
the employment Market as a whole or is
 
04:19:22.250 --> 04:19:22.260 align:start position:0%
it too small of a factor right now to be
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
visible to you guys
 
04:19:26.630 --> 04:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
there are practices where you know
 
04:19:28.189 --> 04:19:28.199 align:start position:0%
instead of charging Insurance the doctor
 
04:19:30.650 --> 04:19:30.660 align:start position:0%
gets paid directly and they say look you
 
04:19:32.269 --> 04:19:32.279 align:start position:0%
know those are my fees I'm not even
 
04:19:33.769 --> 04:19:33.779 align:start position:0%
going to bother with the insurance it's
 
04:19:37.370 --> 04:19:37.380 align:start position:0%
a small but there is demand for it I was
 
04:19:39.229 --> 04:19:39.239 align:start position:0%
just curious if you see an impact from
 
04:19:41.750 --> 04:19:41.760 align:start position:0%
that yeah that's not something that we
 
04:19:44.150 --> 04:19:44.160 align:start position:0%
in the employment data that we have
 
04:19:46.370 --> 04:19:46.380 align:start position:0%
would be able to discern that we we can
 
04:19:48.650 --> 04:19:48.660 align:start position:0%
certainly get an idea about the boutique
 
04:19:50.870 --> 04:19:50.880 align:start position:0%
providers but in terms of their their
 
04:19:53.750 --> 04:19:53.760 align:start position:0%
payment and and their in their payment
 
04:19:55.849 --> 04:19:55.859 align:start position:0%
processes we really don't have any data
 
04:19:58.550 --> 04:19:58.560 align:start position:0%
on that thank you I'm going to share an
 
04:20:01.610 --> 04:20:01.620 align:start position:0%
interesting I didn't know that uh that
 
04:20:03.130 --> 04:20:03.140 align:start position:0%
we found out from the community college
 
04:20:07.990 --> 04:20:08.000 align:start position:0%
uh Chancellor that you can get your
 
04:20:11.990 --> 04:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
nursing license in two years
 
04:20:15.050 --> 04:20:15.060 align:start position:0%
through the community college and I said
 
04:20:17.410 --> 04:20:17.420 align:start position:0%
to him why aren't you promoting that
 
04:20:20.809 --> 04:20:20.819 align:start position:0%
my goodness I could go out and get a 70
 
04:20:23.090 --> 04:20:23.100 align:start position:0%
000 a year job with a two-year with a
 
04:20:26.870 --> 04:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
two-year degree yeah who knew yeah so I
 
04:20:28.910 --> 04:20:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm all done I'll get off my soapbox and
 
04:20:30.889 --> 04:20:30.899 align:start position:0%
it looks like the day that I've I've
 
04:20:31.969 --> 04:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
looked at
 
04:20:33.650 --> 04:20:33.660 align:start position:0%
um community colleges are producing
 
04:20:38.150 --> 04:20:38.160 align:start position:0%
maybe 120 or so two-year nursing on an
 
04:20:40.610 --> 04:20:40.620 align:start position:0%
annual basis which isn't a huge number
 
04:20:43.250 --> 04:20:43.260 align:start position:0%
when you consider all of the the
 
04:20:45.889 --> 04:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
different communities
 
04:20:45.899 --> 04:20:46.790 align:start position:0%
different communities
yeah

04:20:46.790 --> 04:20:46.800 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:20:49.370 --> 04:20:49.380 align:start position:0%
yeah so obviously there is capacity
 
04:20:53.210 --> 04:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
there yeah to provide at the right price
 
04:20:55.370 --> 04:20:55.380 align:start position:0%
yeah and you see the the growing demand
 
04:20:58.130 --> 04:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
obviously is there and that's and that's
 
04:21:00.170 --> 04:21:00.180 align:start position:0%
and the the on the demand side that
 
04:21:02.450 --> 04:21:02.460 align:start position:0%
those numbers are taken from
 
04:21:04.070 --> 04:21:04.080 align:start position:0%
um you know that's looking at all
 
04:21:06.050 --> 04:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
postings for New Hampshire employment
 
04:21:07.729 --> 04:21:07.739 align:start position:0%
and looking at that growth so the demand
 
04:21:10.010 --> 04:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
for that that registered nurse with that
 
04:21:12.469 --> 04:21:12.479 align:start position:0%
two-year degree is right up there
 
04:21:14.210 --> 04:21:14.220 align:start position:0%
significantly increased over where it
 
04:21:16.189 --> 04:21:16.199 align:start position:0%
was prior to the pandemic okay thank you
 
04:21:28.490 --> 04:21:28.500 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:28.500 --> 04:21:32.830 align:start position:0%
 
again

04:21:32.830 --> 04:21:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:36.790 --> 04:21:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:39.290 --> 04:21:39.300 align:start position:0%
good afternoon everyone um my name is
 
04:21:41.389 --> 04:21:41.399 align:start position:0%
Debbie scary I'm the president of the
 
04:21:42.349 --> 04:21:42.359 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire college and university
 
04:21:44.570 --> 04:21:44.580 align:start position:0%
Council I also serve
 
04:21:46.610 --> 04:21:46.620 align:start position:0%
um on the unique commission
 
04:21:49.370 --> 04:21:49.380 align:start position:0%
um and uh as has been previously stated
 
04:21:51.050 --> 04:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
we'll be getting together on Monday to
 
04:21:52.370 --> 04:21:52.380 align:start position:0%
talk a little bit about
 
04:21:54.590 --> 04:21:54.600 align:start position:0%
um all of the of what's in front of us
 
04:21:56.510 --> 04:21:56.520 align:start position:0%
today for sure I really want to thank
 
04:21:58.010 --> 04:21:58.020 align:start position:0%
you for the opportunity
 
04:22:00.290 --> 04:22:00.300 align:start position:0%
um to share um our thoughts on the
 
04:22:03.170 --> 04:22:03.180 align:start position:0%
proposed changes to the unique plan
 
04:22:06.349 --> 04:22:06.359 align:start position:0%
um as you know this proposes major
 
04:22:09.650 --> 04:22:09.660 align:start position:0%
changes to the unique program and uh you
 
04:22:11.090 --> 04:22:11.100 align:start position:0%
know that the fees that have been
 
04:22:13.550 --> 04:22:13.560 align:start position:0%
generated to support this program as we
 
04:22:15.650 --> 04:22:15.660 align:start position:0%
discussed do vary from year to year but
 
04:22:18.349 --> 04:22:18.359 align:start position:0%
this would be a Major Impact what we
 
04:22:19.729 --> 04:22:19.739 align:start position:0%
have proposed
 
04:22:21.530 --> 04:22:21.540 align:start position:0%
um just thinking a little bit about the
 
04:22:23.450 --> 04:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
commission it's been around in the
 
04:22:27.050 --> 04:22:27.060 align:start position:0%
program but it's been around since 1997.
 
04:22:29.330 --> 04:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
um which has representatives from both
 
04:22:31.849 --> 04:22:31.859 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the house administers the
 
04:22:31.859 --> 04:22:32.990 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the house administers the
program

04:22:32.990 --> 04:22:33.000 align:start position:0%
program
 
04:22:35.750 --> 04:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
um that we've been talking about we've
 
04:22:37.490 --> 04:22:37.500 align:start position:0%
referred to it as the endowment program
 
04:22:39.590 --> 04:22:39.600 align:start position:0%
just to be really clear that is a
 
04:22:42.170 --> 04:22:42.180 align:start position:0%
campus-based restricted scholarship fund
 
04:22:44.170 --> 04:22:44.180 align:start position:0%
that only can be used for scholarships
 
04:22:48.769 --> 04:22:48.779 align:start position:0%
and also the direct funds as well 100
 
04:22:51.830 --> 04:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
percent of funds have been used
 
04:22:53.809 --> 04:22:53.819 align:start position:0%
specifically for student scholarships up
 
04:22:55.729 --> 04:22:55.739 align:start position:0%
until this point
 
04:22:58.189 --> 04:22:58.199 align:start position:0%
um students will receive these
 
04:23:00.710 --> 04:23:00.720 align:start position:0%
particular scholarships are not required
 
04:23:03.410 --> 04:23:03.420 align:start position:0%
to repay them this is pure Aid to New
 
04:23:05.570 --> 04:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire needs students and their
 
04:23:07.849 --> 04:23:07.859 align:start position:0%
families these are not loans and these
 
04:23:08.929 --> 04:23:08.939 align:start position:0%
scholarships May mean the difference
 
04:23:11.630 --> 04:23:11.640 align:start position:0%
between a student heading to college or
 
04:23:13.490 --> 04:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
deciding he or she simply can't afford
 
04:23:14.570 --> 04:23:14.580 align:start position:0%
the expense
 
04:23:17.510 --> 04:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
it is tremendously successful program to
 
04:23:20.630 --> 04:23:20.640 align:start position:0%
date has dispersed 186 million dollars
 
04:23:22.429 --> 04:23:22.439 align:start position:0%
in scholarship funds again to our
 
04:23:24.229 --> 04:23:24.239 align:start position:0%
neediest students and I think we talked
 
04:23:25.610 --> 04:23:25.620 align:start position:0%
a little bit earlier about the extent to
 
04:23:28.550 --> 04:23:28.560 align:start position:0%
which programs like this help to retain
 
04:23:31.189 --> 04:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
students in New Hampshire because these
 
04:23:33.650 --> 04:23:33.660 align:start position:0%
are for New Hampshire students
 
04:23:35.809 --> 04:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
over the years there's been strong
 
04:23:37.490 --> 04:23:37.500 align:start position:0%
bipartisan support for The Unique
 
04:23:40.130 --> 04:23:40.140 align:start position:0%
scholarship program and the legislature
 
04:23:42.410 --> 04:23:42.420 align:start position:0%
has consistently turned back efforts to
 
04:23:45.590 --> 04:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
redirect These funds for other purposes
 
04:23:48.530 --> 04:23:48.540 align:start position:0%
while student debt assistance is an
 
04:23:49.790 --> 04:23:49.800 align:start position:0%
important objective and I think the
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
folks that have been here today have
 
04:23:53.450 --> 04:23:53.460 align:start position:0%
laid out a really good case it just
 
04:23:54.889 --> 04:23:54.899 align:start position:0%
should not come at the expense of
 
04:23:57.050 --> 04:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
student scholarships and for every
 
04:23:59.030 --> 04:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
million dollars taken from the existing
 
04:24:01.250 --> 04:24:01.260 align:start position:0%
program we think maybe up to a thousand
 
04:24:03.290 --> 04:24:03.300 align:start position:0%
scholarships to New Hampshire students
 
04:24:07.429 --> 04:24:07.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:09.290 --> 04:24:09.300 align:start position:0%
we've heard New Hampshire Business
 
04:24:11.389 --> 04:24:11.399 align:start position:0%
Leaders and certainly this committee as
 
04:24:13.670 --> 04:24:13.680 align:start position:0%
well discuss the need for well-educated
 
04:24:15.530 --> 04:24:15.540 align:start position:0%
Workforce and the vast majority of
 
04:24:17.689 --> 04:24:17.699 align:start position:0%
high-paying jobs in our states will
 
04:24:20.030 --> 04:24:20.040 align:start position:0%
require a degree so the fact that we're
 
04:24:21.769 --> 04:24:21.779 align:start position:0%
considering taking away money from
 
04:24:25.010 --> 04:24:25.020 align:start position:0%
scholarships for students to earn a
 
04:24:27.650 --> 04:24:27.660 align:start position:0%
college degree to effectively pay for
 
04:24:29.210 --> 04:24:29.220 align:start position:0%
loans later on
 
04:24:34.250 --> 04:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
makes questionable public policy in some
 
04:24:37.010 --> 04:24:37.020 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences for sure
 
04:24:39.050 --> 04:24:39.060 align:start position:0%
this change would result in the loss of
 
04:24:40.670 --> 04:24:40.680 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars in student
 
04:24:43.010 --> 04:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
scholarships for the most financially
 
04:24:44.809 --> 04:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
vulnerable New Hampshire families and
 
04:24:46.490 --> 04:24:46.500 align:start position:0%
according to the National Association of
 
04:24:49.370 --> 04:24:49.380 align:start position:0%
State student grant and aid programs New
 
04:24:51.469 --> 04:24:51.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire ranks at the bottom for
 
04:24:53.689 --> 04:24:53.699 align:start position:0%
tuition aid for our students so there is
 
04:24:56.870 --> 04:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
it's not that there are other funds
 
04:24:59.990 --> 04:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
available for student scholarships when
 
04:25:02.929 --> 04:25:02.939 align:start position:0%
calculating this we're talking about the
 
04:25:05.269 --> 04:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
grant dollar amounts per population and
 
04:25:07.189 --> 04:25:07.199 align:start position:0%
just for example the state of Vermont
 
04:25:10.910 --> 04:25:10.920 align:start position:0%
ranks number 20 Maine is 40 and I think
 
04:25:13.910 --> 04:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
I mentioned we're 50.
 
04:25:16.490 --> 04:25:16.500 align:start position:0%
um the unique scholarship plan is the
 
04:25:19.309 --> 04:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
only long-term scholarship program that
 
04:25:20.929 --> 04:25:20.939 align:start position:0%
exists in the state with a long
 
04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
established record of success assisting
 
04:25:24.950 --> 04:25:24.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire students and their
 
04:25:27.530 --> 04:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
families and I'd be very happy to answer
 
04:25:29.990 --> 04:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
any questions if you have any
 
04:25:31.630 --> 04:25:31.640 align:start position:0%
for me
 
04:25:33.950 --> 04:25:33.960 align:start position:0%
it's Friday afternoon too so I
 
04:25:33.960 --> 04:25:37.010 align:start position:0%
it's Friday afternoon too so I
understand

04:25:37.010 --> 04:25:37.020 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:41.210 --> 04:25:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:44.389 --> 04:25:44.399 align:start position:0%
I've been thinking it has been all week
 
04:25:46.309 --> 04:25:46.319 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
04:25:48.590 --> 04:25:48.600 align:start position:0%
Mary can I just say thank you oh you're
 
04:25:51.950 --> 04:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
so welcome we share a passion for Unique
 
04:25:54.649 --> 04:25:54.659 align:start position:0%
over the years we've
 
04:25:54.659 --> 04:25:55.910 align:start position:0%
over the years we've
um

04:25:55.910 --> 04:25:55.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:25:57.410 --> 04:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
we've gone through these different
 
04:26:00.229 --> 04:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
iterations that have come to us and I
 
04:26:02.809 --> 04:26:02.819 align:start position:0%
just thank you for what you do and what
 
04:26:05.090 --> 04:26:05.100 align:start position:0%
this means to the colleges in our state
 
04:26:07.610 --> 04:26:07.620 align:start position:0%
and the students in our state because it
 
04:26:09.710 --> 04:26:09.720 align:start position:0%
has made a difference in um
 
04:26:13.670 --> 04:26:13.680 align:start position:0%
I have no qualms with the need that we
 
04:26:17.929 --> 04:26:17.939 align:start position:0%
have it's absolutely but I just
 
04:26:20.689 --> 04:26:20.699 align:start position:0%
it's how do we take money away from our
 
04:26:20.699 --> 04:26:22.729 align:start position:0%
it's how do we take money away from our
students

04:26:22.729 --> 04:26:22.739 align:start position:0%
students
 
04:26:25.070 --> 04:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
um and I know this is a very desperate
 
04:26:27.889 --> 04:26:27.899 align:start position:0%
Health Care is it's desperate
 
04:26:29.510 --> 04:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
um our Nursing Home in Hillsborough
 
04:26:29.520 --> 04:26:30.590 align:start position:0%
um our Nursing Home in Hillsborough
County

04:26:30.590 --> 04:26:30.600 align:start position:0%
County
 
04:26:32.870 --> 04:26:32.880 align:start position:0%
um we are short staffed so we um we have
 
04:26:34.729 --> 04:26:34.739 align:start position:0%
to close beds in our nursing homes
 
04:26:37.910 --> 04:26:37.920 align:start position:0%
because we can't staff them and it's
 
04:26:39.830 --> 04:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
awful for everyone
 
04:26:41.570 --> 04:26:41.580 align:start position:0%
um but I just don't think this is a
 
04:26:43.729 --> 04:26:43.739 align:start position:0%
solution and you know I think our
 
04:26:46.550 --> 04:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
community colleges are doing a yeoman's
 
04:26:50.149 --> 04:26:50.159 align:start position:0%
job I think all our College of as have
 
04:26:52.070 --> 04:26:52.080 align:start position:0%
started some kind of a program their
 
04:26:54.290 --> 04:26:54.300 align:start position:0%
articulation pro programs everywhere
 
04:26:56.929 --> 04:26:56.939 align:start position:0%
it's how do we recruit enough and you
 
04:26:59.090 --> 04:26:59.100 align:start position:0%
know good pay probably is one of the
 
04:27:01.729 --> 04:27:01.739 align:start position:0%
biggest pieces that we could do but you
 
04:27:03.830 --> 04:27:03.840 align:start position:0%
know it's just
 
04:27:07.370 --> 04:27:07.380 align:start position:0%
I have to stand with unique as it is
 
04:27:10.189 --> 04:27:10.199 align:start position:0%
um as much as I know and feel the need I
 
04:27:11.630 --> 04:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
see the need
 
04:27:14.210 --> 04:27:14.220 align:start position:0%
um hear the need constantly I just don't
 
04:27:16.010 --> 04:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
feel that this is the appropriate
 
04:27:17.870 --> 04:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
funding source I'd love to see another
 
04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
funding source because I really and
 
04:27:21.530 --> 04:27:21.540 align:start position:0%
truly believe we need to do something
 
04:27:24.349 --> 04:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
desperately but I thank you for being
 
04:27:27.710 --> 04:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
here and kind of giving your history
 
04:27:30.229 --> 04:27:30.239 align:start position:0%
um and the treasurer what what this has
 
04:27:32.929 --> 04:27:32.939 align:start position:0%
done and I know our our chairman over
 
04:27:35.269 --> 04:27:35.279 align:start position:0%
here for finance knows well what fine
 
04:27:38.510 --> 04:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
521 529 has done for so many children
 
04:27:39.889 --> 04:27:39.899 align:start position:0%
across our state
 
04:27:43.490 --> 04:27:43.500 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for having me
 
04:27:47.330 --> 04:27:47.340 align:start position:0%
yeah actually two one of them is I'm uh
 
04:27:49.490 --> 04:27:49.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question and thank you
 
04:27:51.229 --> 04:27:51.239 align:start position:0%
for answering them
 
04:27:53.570 --> 04:27:53.580 align:start position:0%
I'm a freshman can you just give me a
 
04:27:55.790 --> 04:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
brief background on you know the New
 
04:27:57.469 --> 04:27:57.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire college and university Council
 
04:28:00.050 --> 04:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
it's just I I haven't bumped into your
 
04:28:02.570 --> 04:28:02.580 align:start position:0%
organization yet absolutely so the New
 
04:28:04.309 --> 04:28:04.319 align:start position:0%
Hampshire College University Council has
 
04:28:07.550 --> 04:28:07.560 align:start position:0%
been around for about 60 years and uh
 
04:28:09.229 --> 04:28:09.239 align:start position:0%
it's a membership organization of the
 
04:28:11.149 --> 04:28:11.159 align:start position:0%
colleges and universities here in New
 
04:28:13.010 --> 04:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we actually think we're one of
 
04:28:14.870 --> 04:28:14.880 align:start position:0%
the only ones in the state that have
 
04:28:17.269 --> 04:28:17.279 align:start position:0%
both the publics and the privates
 
04:28:19.370 --> 04:28:19.380 align:start position:0%
um under one membership
 
04:28:19.380 --> 04:28:20.030 align:start position:0%
um under one membership
um

04:28:20.030 --> 04:28:20.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:22.429 --> 04:28:22.439 align:start position:0%
so that's basically we do a lot of work
 
04:28:25.070 --> 04:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
around advocacy
 
04:28:26.990 --> 04:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
um you know is we are discussing here
 
04:28:27.000 --> 04:28:28.370 align:start position:0%
um you know is we are discussing here
certainly

04:28:28.370 --> 04:28:28.380 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
04:28:32.149 --> 04:28:32.159 align:start position:0%
um we do a lot of uh looking at how
 
04:28:35.570 --> 04:28:35.580 align:start position:0%
better to reduce uh costs by our
 
04:28:38.210 --> 04:28:38.220 align:start position:0%
libraries work together and making joint
 
04:28:40.610 --> 04:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
purchases we do a lot of collaborative
 
04:28:40.620 --> 04:28:42.050 align:start position:0%
purchases we do a lot of collaborative
programming

04:28:42.050 --> 04:28:42.060 align:start position:0%
programming
 
04:28:44.570 --> 04:28:44.580 align:start position:0%
I appreciate it and my you know more
 
04:28:46.670 --> 04:28:46.680 align:start position:0%
substantial question was if I understood
 
04:28:48.769 --> 04:28:48.779 align:start position:0%
the presentation correctly this amount
 
04:28:50.750 --> 04:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
available for the direct scholarships
 
04:28:53.450 --> 04:28:53.460 align:start position:0%
has just been increased in 21. you're
 
04:28:55.370 --> 04:28:55.380 align:start position:0%
talking about long track record of
 
04:28:57.170 --> 04:28:57.180 align:start position:0%
success you know
 
04:28:59.510 --> 04:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
can you speak on what you think the
 
04:29:01.550 --> 04:29:01.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate level of support for it is I
 
04:29:03.530 --> 04:29:03.540 align:start position:0%
mean it was successful before it got a
 
04:29:06.290 --> 04:29:06.300 align:start position:0%
huge funding increase and you know I'm
 
04:29:08.090 --> 04:29:08.100 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand if you have a
 
04:29:09.950 --> 04:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
measure on what would be an appropriate
 
04:29:11.929 --> 04:29:11.939 align:start position:0%
level of funding here
 
04:29:13.610 --> 04:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
so I think
 
04:29:15.530 --> 04:29:15.540 align:start position:0%
um the commission has done a great job
 
04:29:17.149 --> 04:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
with the money that it's been working
 
04:29:19.790 --> 04:29:19.800 align:start position:0%
with and the and as we have said up
 
04:29:21.710 --> 04:29:21.720 align:start position:0%
until this point 100 of the money that's
 
04:29:24.110 --> 04:29:24.120 align:start position:0%
gone from the unique funds have gone to
 
04:29:26.269 --> 04:29:26.279 align:start position:0%
scholarships and that's been you know 17
 
04:29:28.490 --> 04:29:28.500 align:start position:0%
18 million dollars depending on the year
 
04:29:32.630 --> 04:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
so I guess I I'm sort of a historian on
 
04:29:34.070 --> 04:29:34.080 align:start position:0%
that one and I would like to see that
 
04:29:37.189 --> 04:29:37.199 align:start position:0%
history continue and again totally agree
 
04:29:39.969 --> 04:29:39.979 align:start position:0%
that there is a need for the kinds of
 
04:29:42.229 --> 04:29:42.239 align:start position:0%
strategy to address some of the other
 
04:29:43.490 --> 04:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
pieces that we've been talking about
 
04:29:45.530 --> 04:29:45.540 align:start position:0%
here this afternoon which is really hope
 
04:29:47.750 --> 04:29:47.760 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't be from the unique funds
 
04:29:50.389 --> 04:29:50.399 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
04:29:52.130 --> 04:29:52.140 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Cameron thank you for being
 
04:29:52.140 --> 04:29:53.330 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Cameron thank you for being
here

04:29:53.330 --> 04:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:29:56.330 --> 04:29:56.340 align:start position:0%
um don't you think that this is going
 
04:29:57.950 --> 04:29:57.960 align:start position:0%
for the same goal of a productive
 
04:30:00.769 --> 04:30:00.779 align:start position:0%
Workforce or helps to that end I mean
 
04:30:03.170 --> 04:30:03.180 align:start position:0%
whether it's a student in this pathway
 
04:30:06.290 --> 04:30:06.300 align:start position:0%
or that pathway I mean it's the ultimate
 
04:30:08.330 --> 04:30:08.340 align:start position:0%
goal is a productive Workforce that's
 
04:30:08.340 --> 04:30:09.410 align:start position:0%
goal is a productive Workforce that's
true

04:30:09.410 --> 04:30:09.420 align:start position:0%
true
 
04:30:12.410 --> 04:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
um but what I I guess my the way I would
 
04:30:16.309 --> 04:30:16.319 align:start position:0%
look at this would be that we need to
 
04:30:18.349 --> 04:30:18.359 align:start position:0%
make sure that we're providing
 
04:30:20.870 --> 04:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
the opportunity and access for all
 
04:30:24.349 --> 04:30:24.359 align:start position:0%
students to take advantage of a college
 
04:30:26.750 --> 04:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
education that's the long term and then
 
04:30:29.809 --> 04:30:29.819 align:start position:0%
we know that many of if not all of the
 
04:30:33.469 --> 04:30:33.479 align:start position:0%
jobs that are high paying uh do require
 
04:30:36.710 --> 04:30:36.720 align:start position:0%
post-secondary education of some sort so
 
04:30:39.830 --> 04:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
it's almost I to me it's we need to
 
04:30:42.830 --> 04:30:42.840 align:start position:0%
provide that opportunity first without
 
04:30:45.110 --> 04:30:45.120 align:start position:0%
that then we if we don't get students
 
04:30:47.929 --> 04:30:47.939 align:start position:0%
into college right then how do we
 
04:30:50.210 --> 04:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
actually have that educated for us I
 
04:30:53.750 --> 04:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
think ideally we would do both
 
04:30:53.760 --> 04:30:55.550 align:start position:0%
think ideally we would do both
right

04:30:55.550 --> 04:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
right
 
04:30:56.809 --> 04:30:56.819 align:start position:0%
the questions
 
04:30:58.969 --> 04:30:58.979 align:start position:0%
yes thank you very much thank you
 
04:31:01.490 --> 04:31:01.500 align:start position:0%

04:31:11.269 --> 04:31:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:15.309 --> 04:31:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:17.389 --> 04:31:17.399 align:start position:0%
I've been
 
04:31:23.530 --> 04:31:23.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:27.010 --> 04:31:27.020 align:start position:0%
for the policy director
 
04:31:30.110 --> 04:31:30.120 align:start position:0%
yeah sorry

so is there anyone else here that would
 
04:31:35.870 --> 04:31:35.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:35.880 --> 04:31:37.490 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:31:37.490 --> 04:31:37.500 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:31:40.070 --> 04:31:40.080 align:start position:0%
well seeing none thank you for coming

and we'll we'll talk Among Us ourselves
 
04:31:46.670 --> 04:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
try to
 
04:31:46.680 --> 04:32:00.170 align:start position:0%
try to
but

04:32:00.170 --> 04:32:00.180 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:05.590 --> 04:32:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:05.600 --> 04:32:13.870 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:32:13.870 --> 04:32:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:23.990 --> 04:32:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:26.110 --> 04:32:26.120 align:start position:0%
we'll get into school
 
04:32:28.490 --> 04:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
we're here to reduce the traffic on 90
 
04:32:28.500 --> 04:33:44.150 align:start position:0%
we're here to reduce the traffic on 90
series

04:33:44.150 --> 04:33:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:44.160 --> 04:33:49.609 align:start position:0%
 
if

04:33:49.609 --> 04:33:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:53.330 --> 04:33:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
good thing I was a jerk because I would
 
04:33:59.170 --> 04:33:59.180 align:start position:0%
be dead today oh really
 
04:34:01.429 --> 04:34:01.439 align:start position:0%
and I was in the hall that put me in the
 
04:34:03.010 --> 04:34:03.020 align:start position:0%
hall well
 
04:34:07.269 --> 04:34:07.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:11.269 --> 04:34:11.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:11.279 --> 04:34:13.609 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:34:13.609 --> 04:34:13.619 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:34:24.051 --> 04:34:24.061 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:26.150 --> 04:34:26.160 align:start position:0%
no I think that was more because I think
 
04:34:27.890 --> 04:34:27.900 align:start position:0%
we're going to have to either reconvene
 
04:34:29.689 --> 04:34:29.699 align:start position:0%
for everybody
 
04:34:29.699 --> 04:34:31.510 align:start position:0%
for everybody
or

04:34:31.510 --> 04:34:31.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
04:34:34.029 --> 04:34:34.039 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:34:38.570 --> 04:34:38.580 align:start position:0%
oh good I'm glad they're all solved now
 
04:34:40.369 --> 04:34:40.379 align:start position:0%
Mick you got something
 
04:34:42.349 --> 04:34:42.359 align:start position:0%
so I have a couple of things I think we
 
04:34:44.150 --> 04:34:44.160 align:start position:0%
can cover uh
 
04:34:46.070 --> 04:34:46.080 align:start position:0%
easy things
 
04:34:48.109 --> 04:34:48.119 align:start position:0%
so if everyone has their binder clipped
 
04:34:49.730 --> 04:34:49.740 align:start position:0%
packet that I passed out this morning
 
04:34:52.789 --> 04:34:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.869 --> 04:34:59.879 align:start position:0%
 
04:34:59.879 --> 04:35:11.150 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:35:11.150 --> 04:35:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:13.189 --> 04:35:13.199 align:start position:0%
so you can see I've I've filled in some
 
04:35:14.810 --> 04:35:14.820 align:start position:0%
of the columns of some of the sections
 
04:35:18.410 --> 04:35:18.420 align:start position:0%
that we agreed upon uh to this point uh
 
04:35:20.150 --> 04:35:20.160 align:start position:0%
one that I've kind of skipped over
 
04:35:23.090 --> 04:35:23.100 align:start position:0%
that's a I think a pretty easy one is uh
 
04:35:25.730 --> 04:35:25.740 align:start position:0%
page 20 section 51 the repeal of the
 
04:35:27.170 --> 04:35:27.180 align:start position:0%
advanced manufacturing education
 
04:35:30.109 --> 04:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
advisory Council this is a for lack of a
 
04:35:32.570 --> 04:35:32.580 align:start position:0%
better phrase a defunct Council that I
 
04:35:33.890 --> 04:35:33.900 align:start position:0%
don't think's met for quite some time
 
04:35:37.369 --> 04:35:37.379 align:start position:0%
and this was really just a repealing an
 
04:35:39.170 --> 04:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
old Council and a dedicated fund there's
 
04:35:40.910 --> 04:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
no money in it I've confirmed with the
 
04:35:43.070 --> 04:35:43.080 align:start position:0%
Department that other entities since
 
04:35:45.769 --> 04:35:45.779 align:start position:0%
they that met last have kind of taken
 
04:35:47.209 --> 04:35:47.219 align:start position:0%
over the work that that
 
04:35:49.429 --> 04:35:49.439 align:start position:0%
council did do so it was duplicative so
 
04:35:51.109 --> 04:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
that's why the governor had their repeal
 
04:35:52.970 --> 04:35:52.980 align:start position:0%
in here so you could be okay and accept
 
04:35:56.109 --> 04:35:56.119 align:start position:0%
that if you wanted to second by Marriott
 
04:35:58.849 --> 04:35:58.859 align:start position:0%
yeah so the house bill 2 repeals that
 
04:36:00.470 --> 04:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
you would just say yep that's good
 
04:36:02.330 --> 04:36:02.340 align:start position:0%
everybody in favor
 
04:36:06.051 --> 04:36:06.061 align:start position:0%
all right unanimous okay I'm I suspect
 
04:36:07.551 --> 04:36:07.561 align:start position:0%
we're probably not in a position to do
 
04:36:09.289 --> 04:36:09.299 align:start position:0%
anything with the sections we just had
 
04:36:11.150 --> 04:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
the work session on
 
04:36:14.330 --> 04:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
you want to hold off that for now
 
04:36:17.929 --> 04:36:17.939 align:start position:0%
or I I I don't know I that's the next
 
04:36:20.090 --> 04:36:20.100 align:start position:0%
grouping of uh
 
04:36:21.830 --> 04:36:21.840 align:start position:0%
of sections that we have heard from
 
04:36:23.810 --> 04:36:23.820 align:start position:0%
folks but we just heard from them so I'm
 
04:36:25.131 --> 04:36:25.141 align:start position:0%
not sure if
 
04:36:28.730 --> 04:36:28.740 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:31.730 --> 04:36:31.740 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm maybe after Monday so we can
 
04:36:34.789 --> 04:36:34.799 align:start position:0%
hold that until after that meeting
 
04:36:37.510 --> 04:36:37.520 align:start position:0%
three of us here
 
04:36:47.631 --> 04:36:47.641 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:47.641 --> 04:36:52.789 align:start position:0%
 
but

04:36:52.789 --> 04:36:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:57.709 --> 04:36:57.719 align:start position:0%
the last chat that's bar chart showed us
 
04:37:01.609 --> 04:37:01.619 align:start position:0%
was okay if we give them
 
04:37:01.619 --> 04:37:06.470 align:start position:0%
was okay if we give them
okay

04:37:06.470 --> 04:37:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:10.849 --> 04:37:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:13.789 --> 04:37:13.799 align:start position:0%
if we give 2500 a year
 
04:37:13.799 --> 04:37:15.170 align:start position:0%
if we give 2500 a year
Alex

04:37:15.170 --> 04:37:15.180 align:start position:0%
Alex
 
04:37:18.070 --> 04:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
what their what their own businesses
 
04:37:26.510 --> 04:37:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:30.170 --> 04:37:30.180 align:start position:0%
well I I think I think your meeting on
 
04:37:32.150 --> 04:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
Monday will probably shed more light on
 
04:37:36.250 --> 04:37:36.260 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:38.570 --> 04:37:38.580 align:start position:0%
Monday up front
 
04:37:41.929 --> 04:37:41.939 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:43.970 --> 04:37:43.980 align:start position:0%
on a bone that you pay an entrance and
 
04:37:45.230 --> 04:37:45.240 align:start position:0%
all that so
 
04:37:47.209 --> 04:37:47.219 align:start position:0%
and that is it's a thousand dollars
 
04:37:49.429 --> 04:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
scholarship I think worth three thousand
 
04:37:49.439 --> 04:37:50.570 align:start position:0%
scholarship I think worth three thousand
dollars

04:37:50.570 --> 04:37:50.580 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
04:37:53.810 --> 04:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
reducing your loan
 
04:37:55.689 --> 04:37:55.699 align:start position:0%
wow that's all
 
04:37:58.670 --> 04:37:58.680 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a telling point to me
 
04:38:01.810 --> 04:38:01.820 align:start position:0%
the effects money
 
04:38:04.189 --> 04:38:04.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I was going to ask
 
04:38:06.890 --> 04:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler when you go there
 
04:38:09.349 --> 04:38:09.359 align:start position:0%
to you know look more into that because
 
04:38:13.429 --> 04:38:13.439 align:start position:0%
I think that's a good policy if we could
 
04:38:16.070 --> 04:38:16.080 align:start position:0%
agree on it but it would be good because
 
04:38:17.929 --> 04:38:17.939 align:start position:0%
he didn't go through the Full House and
 
04:38:19.730 --> 04:38:19.740 align:start position:0%
the policy committees and all that to
 
04:38:21.709 --> 04:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
get as close as we can to a policy
 
04:38:23.689 --> 04:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
committee from your meeting on that and
 
04:38:25.730 --> 04:38:25.740 align:start position:0%
understand whether those types of
 
04:38:27.410 --> 04:38:27.420 align:start position:0%
changes would be beneficial to me they
 
04:38:29.810 --> 04:38:29.820 align:start position:0%
look beneficial but I'm one person you
 
04:38:30.890 --> 04:38:30.900 align:start position:0%
know so
 
04:38:33.590 --> 04:38:33.600 align:start position:0%
any feedback on that because I you know
 
04:38:35.209 --> 04:38:35.219 align:start position:0%
it's good to have some benefits
 
04:38:37.070 --> 04:38:37.080 align:start position:0%
immediately but I still have a carrot at
 
04:38:39.650 --> 04:38:39.660 align:start position:0%
the end so maybe making 50 at the end
 
04:38:41.390 --> 04:38:41.400 align:start position:0%
and then ten percent over five years
 
04:38:43.730 --> 04:38:43.740 align:start position:0%
would be a good structure
 
04:38:43.740 --> 04:39:02.590 align:start position:0%
would be a good structure
foreign

04:39:02.590 --> 04:39:02.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:08.830 --> 04:39:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:11.990 --> 04:39:12.000 align:start position:0%
scholarship wow that sort of money
 
04:39:14.570 --> 04:39:14.580 align:start position:0%
we're talking about trying to screen to
 
04:39:22.689 --> 04:39:22.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:25.369 --> 04:39:25.379 align:start position:0%
and I agree with with Believe It or Not
 
04:39:26.990 --> 04:39:27.000 align:start position:0%
representative Weiler on this I think
 
04:39:29.090 --> 04:39:29.100 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty so new I can do that and you
 
04:39:32.029 --> 04:39:32.039 align:start position:0%
can agree with me sometimes too but I
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
mean just that that that philosophy of
 
04:39:35.990 --> 04:39:36.000 align:start position:0%
that money up front just making such a
 
04:39:37.970 --> 04:39:37.980 align:start position:0%
big difference and I support the concept
 
04:39:40.670 --> 04:39:40.680 align:start position:0%
of this and it seems to me that this is
 
04:39:42.530 --> 04:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
it's a new program and if they're
 
04:39:44.570 --> 04:39:44.580 align:start position:0%
possible to find funding for it from
 
04:39:46.368 --> 04:39:46.378 align:start position:0%
another source other than unique I would
 
04:39:48.350 --> 04:39:48.360 align:start position:0%
be very happy for that I think that has
 
04:39:48.360 --> 04:39:49.610 align:start position:0%
be very happy for that I think that has
value

04:39:49.610 --> 04:39:49.620 align:start position:0%
value
 
04:39:52.190 --> 04:39:52.200 align:start position:0%
um but and yeah I can see the reason for
 
04:39:54.590 --> 04:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
going from five years to three years but
 
04:39:56.390 --> 04:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
apropos what you had just said when
 
04:39:58.368 --> 04:39:58.378 align:start position:0%
you're starting out and you're sort of
 
04:40:00.170 --> 04:40:00.180 align:start position:0%
gaining experience and gaining you're
 
04:40:02.090 --> 04:40:02.100 align:start position:0%
moving a lot and it's even unreasonable
 
04:40:04.250 --> 04:40:04.260 align:start position:0%
I think with its generation to stay any
 
04:40:05.810 --> 04:40:05.820 align:start position:0%
place for three years and so they're not
 
04:40:07.430 --> 04:40:07.440 align:start position:0%
going to get any benefit out of this
 
04:40:09.410 --> 04:40:09.420 align:start position:0%
some of them will get no benefit out of
 
04:40:11.208 --> 04:40:11.218 align:start position:0%
this at all but they will get a benefit
 
04:40:13.910 --> 04:40:13.920 align:start position:0%
out of the unique money the one thought
 
04:40:15.890 --> 04:40:15.900 align:start position:0%
I'd like to share on that
 
04:40:19.190 --> 04:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
I do think that this is a good concept
 
04:40:22.010 --> 04:40:22.020 align:start position:0%
and if there are considerations in terms
 
04:40:24.410 --> 04:40:24.420 align:start position:0%
of the amounts I would suggest that it
 
04:40:26.570 --> 04:40:26.580 align:start position:0%
may be good policy to keep it but just
 
04:40:28.490 --> 04:40:28.500 align:start position:0%
shift around some of those percentages
 
04:40:31.550 --> 04:40:31.560 align:start position:0%
instead of moving that much but I really
 
04:40:34.190 --> 04:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
believe that this is an idea that has a
 
04:40:36.350 --> 04:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
lot of Merit there are potential
 
04:40:38.630 --> 04:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
difficulties and questions over how
 
04:40:41.208 --> 04:40:41.218 align:start position:0%
effective it will be but honestly we can
 
04:40:43.430 --> 04:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
speculate here as much as we want until
 
04:40:45.650 --> 04:40:45.660 align:start position:0%
we try it and we can measure the results
 
04:40:48.948 --> 04:40:48.958 align:start position:0%
we won't know so maybe we can just shift
 
04:40:50.690 --> 04:40:50.700 align:start position:0%
around some of the funds find it at a
 
04:40:52.430 --> 04:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
lesser level but still create it and
 
04:40:54.650 --> 04:40:54.660 align:start position:0%
test it out to see
 
04:40:56.510 --> 04:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
if we went along with some of the
 
04:40:58.610 --> 04:40:58.620 align:start position:0%
governor's thoughts but reduce that
 
04:41:00.590 --> 04:41:00.600 align:start position:0%
amount of money and say the money we're
 
04:41:02.990 --> 04:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
already giving away on on scholarships
 
04:41:05.510 --> 04:41:05.520 align:start position:0%
we should increase by 10 percent
 
04:41:07.970 --> 04:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
then we'll see what's left
 
04:41:11.208 --> 04:41:11.218 align:start position:0%
and so on I mean you know then maybe we
 
04:41:12.530 --> 04:41:12.540 align:start position:0%
throw a little money at this other
 
04:41:14.630 --> 04:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
concept but you know I don't know if
 
04:41:16.310 --> 04:41:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's enough to make any difference in
 
04:41:19.128 --> 04:41:19.138 align:start position:0%
time will tell or take the difference
 
04:41:23.050 --> 04:41:23.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:25.430 --> 04:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
is operating on a 14 million dollar
 
04:41:27.708 --> 04:41:27.718 align:start position:0%
budget forecast to be a 17 million
 
04:41:29.628 --> 04:41:29.638 align:start position:0%
dollar budget take the Delta and apply
 
04:41:31.730 --> 04:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
to the governor's program one one quick
 
04:41:34.430 --> 04:41:34.440 align:start position:0%
subject yes in regards to that Army
 
04:41:37.670 --> 04:41:37.680 align:start position:0%
program that only got a meal
 
04:41:40.670 --> 04:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
I would argue too that a million for
 
04:41:44.030 --> 04:41:44.040 align:start position:0%
that seems to be rather low and maybe we
 
04:41:44.040 --> 04:41:45.830 align:start position:0%
that seems to be rather low and maybe we
can

04:41:45.830 --> 04:41:45.840 align:start position:0%
can
 
04:41:48.708 --> 04:41:48.718 align:start position:0%
find a way to increase that a little
 
04:41:51.350 --> 04:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
because that is a program that appears
 
04:41:54.110 --> 04:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
to have been uh you know a stepchild it
 
04:41:57.530 --> 04:41:57.540 align:start position:0%
was created and never funded and and to
 
04:41:59.330 --> 04:41:59.340 align:start position:0%
me that's something that a meal may not
 
04:42:01.190 --> 04:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
make much of a difference I think maybe
 
04:42:02.990 --> 04:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
we could just find a little bit
 
04:42:06.470 --> 04:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
somewhere to I I said somewhere I was
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
not specific okay it's always up to the
 
04:42:08.878 --> 04:42:10.368 align:start position:0%
not specific okay it's always up to the
employer

04:42:10.368 --> 04:42:10.378 align:start position:0%
employer
 
04:42:12.830 --> 04:42:12.840 align:start position:0%
set it up all right if you come to me
 
04:42:14.930 --> 04:42:14.940 align:start position:0%
work for me I'm going to start paying on
 
04:42:17.930 --> 04:42:17.940 align:start position:0%
your college tuition loans not only will
 
04:42:20.150 --> 04:42:20.160 align:start position:0%
I give you a decent raise but this
 
04:42:21.830 --> 04:42:21.840 align:start position:0%
little five or six I say eight percent
 
04:42:24.530 --> 04:42:24.540 align:start position:0%
I'm also going to spend toward your
 
04:42:28.250 --> 04:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
tuition poll uh your tuition loan yeah
 
04:42:30.650 --> 04:42:30.660 align:start position:0%
and you know it's always something the
 
04:42:34.368 --> 04:42:34.378 align:start position:0%
employer could do yeah and maybe he
 
04:42:36.830 --> 04:42:36.840 align:start position:0%
could go to the and they do some do yeah
 
04:42:39.708 --> 04:42:39.718 align:start position:0%
the bank and make a deal right yeah and
 
04:42:43.128 --> 04:42:43.138 align:start position:0%
to representative Heat this is a 529
 
04:42:45.170 --> 04:42:45.180 align:start position:0%
funded thing it should be used for
 
04:42:47.390 --> 04:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
education I wasn't really going towards
 
04:42:50.448 --> 04:42:50.458 align:start position:0%
the Army for that one but since the
 
04:42:52.550 --> 04:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
program came up in the discussions I
 
04:42:54.770 --> 04:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
think it's something that we should make
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
an effort to find a little bit more for
 
04:42:58.440 --> 04:43:00.410 align:start position:0%
an effort to find a little bit more for
whoops

04:43:00.410 --> 04:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
whoops
 
04:43:02.750 --> 04:43:02.760 align:start position:0%
we are swimming
 
04:43:05.628 --> 04:43:05.638 align:start position:0%
just the statement is how much do are we
 
04:43:05.638 --> 04:43:07.150 align:start position:0%
just the statement is how much do are we
spending

04:43:07.150 --> 04:43:07.160 align:start position:0%
spending
 
04:43:10.250 --> 04:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars about 35 Grand per
 
04:43:10.260 --> 04:43:11.510 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars about 35 Grand per
employee

04:43:11.510 --> 04:43:11.520 align:start position:0%
employee
 
04:43:14.330 --> 04:43:14.340 align:start position:0%
um but then there are people regular
 
04:43:16.550 --> 04:43:16.560 align:start position:0%
people who are paying insurance
 
04:43:19.850 --> 04:43:19.860 align:start position:0%
they're making Stout the CEOs of those
 
04:43:22.730 --> 04:43:22.740 align:start position:0%
companies are making and accept that 20
 
04:43:26.150 --> 04:43:26.160 align:start position:0%
million 100 million and
 
04:43:28.670 --> 04:43:28.680 align:start position:0%
we're struggling to get
 
04:43:30.590 --> 04:43:30.600 align:start position:0%
help in terms of the medical field
 
04:43:32.570 --> 04:43:32.580 align:start position:0%
doctors it's not just nurses that
 
04:43:34.670 --> 04:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
started the whole Medical Professional
 
04:43:34.680 --> 04:43:35.930 align:start position:0%
started the whole Medical Professional
people

04:43:35.930 --> 04:43:35.940 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:43:38.208 --> 04:43:38.218 align:start position:0%
in other countries they take production
 
04:43:41.868 --> 04:43:41.878 align:start position:0%
to go to school here we go do that and
 
04:43:45.170 --> 04:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
we're short especially in the world it's
 
04:43:47.690 --> 04:43:47.700 align:start position:0%
up north and in Texas to the very
 
04:43:50.090 --> 04:43:50.100 align:start position:0%
difficult situation 10 minutes to think
 
04:43:53.930 --> 04:43:53.940 align:start position:0%
about all the money that they're making
 
04:43:57.590 --> 04:43:57.600 align:start position:0%
and there's no efforts to come
 
04:44:00.650 --> 04:44:00.660 align:start position:0%
stabilize into that well that's why both
 
04:44:04.070 --> 04:44:04.080 align:start position:0%
the state and my County are self-insured
 
04:44:09.230 --> 04:44:09.240 align:start position:0%
and you know in your city why should we
 
04:44:10.670 --> 04:44:10.680 align:start position:0%
make billionaires out of insurance
 
04:44:13.930 --> 04:44:13.940 align:start position:0%
companies we have enough cash
 
04:44:26.750 --> 04:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:29.570 --> 04:44:29.580 align:start position:0%
you can say we can put so much in this
 
04:44:31.670 --> 04:44:31.680 align:start position:0%
thing and obviously
 
04:44:34.070 --> 04:44:34.080 align:start position:0%
you know we'll have sometimes that in
 
04:44:35.868 --> 04:44:35.878 align:start position:0%
the process a little more but we'll kind
 
04:44:39.350 --> 04:44:39.360 align:start position:0%
of push it and I remember somebody that
 
04:44:41.208 --> 04:44:41.218 align:start position:0%
was in the insurance said we need about
 
04:44:43.190 --> 04:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
10 year
 
04:44:45.350 --> 04:44:45.360 align:start position:0%
what have you paid in one year you need
 
04:44:49.128 --> 04:44:49.138 align:start position:0%
to help three Michaels 10-year push but
 
04:44:52.390 --> 04:44:52.400 align:start position:0%
you will have a catastrop here
 
04:45:07.868 --> 04:45:07.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:10.490 --> 04:45:10.500 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
04:45:15.128 --> 04:45:15.138 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.890 --> 04:45:18.900 align:start position:0%
so we'll we'll move on from there
 
04:45:21.110 --> 04:45:21.120 align:start position:0%
um all the other sections here at this
 
04:45:23.990 --> 04:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
point are either ccs and H dual and
 
04:45:25.970 --> 04:45:25.980 align:start position:0%
concurrent enrollment and the retirement
 
04:45:28.250 --> 04:45:28.260 align:start position:0%
system provision UNH the
 
04:45:31.190 --> 04:45:31.200 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab uh and Whittemore
 
04:45:31.200 --> 04:45:32.030 align:start position:0%
interoperability lab uh and Whittemore
Center

04:45:32.030 --> 04:45:32.040 align:start position:0%

04:45:32.040 --> 04:45:34.010 align:start position:0%

Doe

04:45:34.010 --> 04:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
Doe
 
04:45:35.810 --> 04:45:35.820 align:start position:0%
this scholarship a unique thing we
 
04:45:39.110 --> 04:45:39.120 align:start position:0%
talked about that one pending dot right
 
04:45:40.730 --> 04:45:40.740 align:start position:0%
away relative to Prime Wetlands we're
 
04:45:41.990 --> 04:45:42.000 align:start position:0%
waiting on additional information we
 
04:45:43.850 --> 04:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
held up on that section
 
04:45:46.550 --> 04:45:46.560 align:start position:0%
and uh that's that's it so I have the
 
04:45:48.350 --> 04:45:48.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Education coming to see us
 
04:45:52.970 --> 04:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
on Monday morning at 10. uh I will have
 
04:45:54.530 --> 04:45:54.540 align:start position:0%
a work session until you need to take a
 
04:45:56.030 --> 04:45:56.040 align:start position:0%
lunch break before the public hearing it
 
04:45:56.040 --> 04:45:56.930 align:start position:0%
lunch break before the public hearing it
too

04:45:56.930 --> 04:45:56.940 align:start position:0%
too
 
04:45:58.250 --> 04:45:58.260 align:start position:0%
um as long as you want to meet we can
 
04:46:12.670 --> 04:46:12.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:15.288 --> 04:46:15.298 align:start position:0%
so uh in the governor's recommended
 
04:46:17.750 --> 04:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
budget there's 2 million a year for dual
 
04:46:19.610 --> 04:46:19.620 align:start position:0%
and concurrent enrollment House Ed and
 
04:46:21.530 --> 04:46:21.540 align:start position:0%
the house passed a bill that made it
 
04:46:24.590 --> 04:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
3.25 million per year and increase the
 
04:46:27.410 --> 04:46:27.420 align:start position:0%
amount of courses from two to five the
 
04:46:30.288 --> 04:46:30.298 align:start position:0%
governor went from two to three so and
 
04:46:32.448 --> 04:46:32.458 align:start position:0%
the bill that came over House Bill 420
 
04:46:33.708 --> 04:46:33.718 align:start position:0%
aligns with what the community college
 
04:46:35.750 --> 04:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
system did request to do that full
 
04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
request it would be two and a half
 
04:46:39.050 --> 04:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
million dollars over the biennium above
 
04:46:40.730 --> 04:46:40.740 align:start position:0%
and beyond the governor's budget
 
04:46:46.368 --> 04:46:46.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:49.368 --> 04:46:49.378 align:start position:0%
uh pretty I think it was 20 to nothing
 
04:46:52.250 --> 04:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
out of education and then a Voice vote
 
04:46:52.260 --> 04:46:54.350 align:start position:0%
out of education and then a Voice vote
perhaps

04:46:54.350 --> 04:46:54.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
04:46:54.360 --> 04:46:56.708 align:start position:0%
perhaps
yeah

04:46:56.708 --> 04:46:56.718 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:47:01.788 --> 04:47:01.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:11.830 --> 04:47:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:14.810 --> 04:47:14.820 align:start position:0%
maybe even some Democrats
 
04:47:19.930 --> 04:47:19.940 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:39.708 --> 04:47:39.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:41.330 --> 04:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
going to get them all out of the public
 
04:47:41.340 --> 04:47:43.750 align:start position:0%
going to get them all out of the public
schools

04:47:43.750 --> 04:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
schools
 
04:47:46.690 --> 04:47:46.700 align:start position:0%
especially in Manchester
 
04:47:51.708 --> 04:47:51.718 align:start position:0%
anyway I think we should add the money I
 
04:47:53.270 --> 04:47:53.280 align:start position:0%
think that's that's a good place to add
 
04:47:54.830 --> 04:47:54.840 align:start position:0%
a little bit you know we can't keep
 
04:47:58.610 --> 04:47:58.620 align:start position:0%
standing up and we have some money
 
04:48:02.030 --> 04:48:02.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:05.448 --> 04:48:05.458 align:start position:0%
right taken away building it flipping
 
04:48:08.230 --> 04:48:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:12.970 --> 04:48:12.980 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:24.288 --> 04:48:24.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:24.298 --> 04:48:30.530 align:start position:0%
 
3.25

04:48:30.530 --> 04:48:30.540 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:32.330 --> 04:48:32.340 align:start position:0%
that was what the bill was yeah I know
 
04:48:35.810 --> 04:48:35.820 align:start position:0%
but that's that's what we're agreeing to
 
04:48:35.820 --> 04:48:38.570 align:start position:0%
but that's that's what we're agreeing to
20-1

04:48:38.570 --> 04:48:38.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:38.580 --> 04:48:40.550 align:start position:0%
 
education

04:48:40.550 --> 04:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
education
 
04:48:42.470 --> 04:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
I want all those people to vote the
 
04:48:42.480 --> 04:48:43.690 align:start position:0%
I want all those people to vote the
budget

04:48:43.690 --> 04:48:43.700 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:48:46.970 --> 04:48:46.980 align:start position:0%
okay I'll second that I'll make it quite
 
04:48:52.868 --> 04:48:52.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:56.628 --> 04:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
we're clear if you go to the next page
 
04:48:58.368 --> 04:48:58.378 align:start position:0%
over the the busy one with all the
 
04:49:04.070 --> 04:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
requests you'll see ccsnh online uh 51.
 
04:49:05.510 --> 04:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
expand the Dual and concurrent
 
04:49:07.670 --> 04:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
enrollment which is House Bill 520 oh
 
04:49:09.890 --> 04:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
excuse me 420. so I I'll draft an
 
04:49:12.830 --> 04:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill 2 and we will
 
04:49:14.570 --> 04:49:14.580 align:start position:0%
overwrite essentially the governor's
 
04:49:18.250 --> 04:49:18.260 align:start position:0%
level with that level of that bill works
 
04:49:21.948 --> 04:49:21.958 align:start position:0%
so I will overwrite sections two through
 
04:49:25.610 --> 04:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
five in House Bill 2 with
 
04:49:27.350 --> 04:49:27.360 align:start position:0%
basically the contents from House Bill
 
04:49:30.530 --> 04:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
420. and that will increase uh our
 
04:49:33.410 --> 04:49:33.420 align:start position:0%
spending 1.25 million a year
 
04:49:47.750 --> 04:49:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:00.910 --> 04:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:03.170 --> 04:50:03.180 align:start position:0%
he said
 
04:50:03.180 --> 04:50:04.430 align:start position:0%
he said
before

04:50:04.430 --> 04:50:04.440 align:start position:0%
before
 
04:50:07.310 --> 04:50:07.320 align:start position:0%
May the capital budget works
 
04:50:09.770 --> 04:50:09.780 align:start position:0%
Treasurer comes in and tells them who
 
04:50:12.470 --> 04:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
can borrow six percent of the total
 
04:50:12.480 --> 04:50:14.410 align:start position:0%
can borrow six percent of the total
revenue

04:50:14.410 --> 04:50:14.420 align:start position:0%
revenue
 
04:50:18.650 --> 04:50:18.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:21.830 --> 04:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
so they start with that figure
 
04:50:23.930 --> 04:50:23.940 align:start position:0%
and look at all the projects
 
04:50:25.970 --> 04:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
I think they govern across they knew
 
04:50:25.980 --> 04:50:26.990 align:start position:0%
I think they govern across they knew
this

04:50:26.990 --> 04:50:27.000 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:50:30.288 --> 04:50:30.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:34.128 --> 04:50:34.138 align:start position:0%
so one of them said to me no
 
04:50:36.050 --> 04:50:36.060 align:start position:0%
we had some meetings at Whittemore
 
04:50:36.060 --> 04:50:37.490 align:start position:0%
we had some meetings at Whittemore
Center

04:50:37.490 --> 04:50:37.500 align:start position:0%
Center
 
04:50:37.500 --> 04:50:42.110 align:start position:0%
Center
good

04:50:42.110 --> 04:50:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:44.150 --> 04:50:44.160 align:start position:0%
so I said to shoot him what did we
 
04:50:46.550 --> 04:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
paying a minute he put in my mouth and I
 
04:50:48.350 --> 04:50:48.360 align:start position:0%
said we had a suggestion and if we're
 
04:50:50.810 --> 04:50:50.820 align:start position:0%
gonna pay for this Whittemore Senate the
 
04:50:52.128 --> 04:50:52.138 align:start position:0%
next time we need to meet there we're
 
04:50:54.770 --> 04:50:54.780 align:start position:0%
not going to pay for it and Kathy our
 
04:50:57.010 --> 04:50:57.020 align:start position:0%
professor said so
 
04:51:00.350 --> 04:51:00.360 align:start position:0%
ordeal she said 20 grand wouldn't it I
 
04:51:02.390 --> 04:51:02.400 align:start position:0%
believe I heard 20 grand
 
04:51:04.788 --> 04:51:04.798 align:start position:0%
expensive because I don't know if they
 
04:51:06.650 --> 04:51:06.660 align:start position:0%
put the floor down for us so when it was
 
04:51:10.368 --> 04:51:10.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:12.890 --> 04:51:12.900 align:start position:0%
yes well I think it was just before the
 
04:51:14.448 --> 04:51:14.458 align:start position:0%
season because we then we had to move
 
04:51:19.150 --> 04:51:19.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:21.110 --> 04:51:21.120 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:51:22.788 --> 04:51:22.798 align:start position:0%
it's kind of
 
04:51:25.490 --> 04:51:25.500 align:start position:0%
a little total thing but anyway it kind
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
of reminds them you know we help each
 
04:51:30.470 --> 04:51:30.480 align:start position:0%
other here we saved money by opening our
 
04:51:30.480 --> 04:51:32.270 align:start position:0%
other here we saved money by opening our
mouths

04:51:32.270 --> 04:51:32.280 align:start position:0%
mouths
 
04:51:35.628 --> 04:51:35.638 align:start position:0%
so I know that's okay no no we don't we
 
04:51:37.850 --> 04:51:37.860 align:start position:0%
don't he's good he's going to prepare it
 
04:51:40.610 --> 04:51:40.620 align:start position:0%
as a an amendment where were you yeah it
 
04:51:44.090 --> 04:51:44.100 align:start position:0%
was um implicit vote
 
04:52:10.670 --> 04:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:15.230 --> 04:52:15.240 align:start position:0%
I think we should wait for the full yeah
 
04:52:15.240 --> 04:52:27.570 align:start position:0%
I think we should wait for the full yeah
um

04:52:27.570 --> 04:52:27.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:27.580 --> 04:52:31.570 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

04:52:31.570 --> 04:52:31.580 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:43.810 --> 04:52:43.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:48.230 --> 04:52:48.240 align:start position:0%
so he took one out and put it in
 
04:52:50.690 --> 04:52:50.700 align:start position:0%
um in our in division two so I couldn't
 
04:52:52.250 --> 04:52:52.260 align:start position:0%
go back in because they still have to
 
04:52:57.830 --> 04:52:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:00.410 --> 04:53:00.420 align:start position:0%
they have one of them
 
04:53:02.690 --> 04:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
and the other one begins
 
04:53:09.910 --> 04:53:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:31.390 --> 04:53:31.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:33.410 --> 04:53:33.420 align:start position:0%
next Tuesday
 
04:53:36.288 --> 04:53:36.298 align:start position:0%
could be on the bout next Tuesday
 
04:53:38.990 --> 04:53:39.000 align:start position:0%
so we could wait
 
04:53:42.948 --> 04:53:42.958 align:start position:0%
what my last conversational Mark he had
 
04:53:46.128 --> 04:53:46.138 align:start position:0%
one of them ending the other one was a
 
04:53:47.708 --> 04:53:47.718 align:start position:0%
matter of
 
04:53:50.150 --> 04:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
if the district approves it doesn't go
 
04:53:52.430 --> 04:53:52.440 align:start position:0%
back into the cap because they don't
 
04:53:56.990 --> 04:53:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.868 --> 04:54:02.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:02.878 --> 04:54:09.288 align:start position:0%
 
School

04:54:09.288 --> 04:54:09.298 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
so the only place to come is back to
 
04:54:12.000 --> 04:54:20.708 align:start position:0%
so the only place to come is back to
here

04:54:20.708 --> 04:54:20.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:23.030 --> 04:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
one of them's in there
 
04:54:25.910 --> 04:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
already in this budget is in the capital
 
04:54:29.090 --> 04:54:29.100 align:start position:0%
budget yeah well I don't I thought he
 
04:54:36.310 --> 04:54:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:39.708 --> 04:54:39.718 align:start position:0%
put the building gate into something
 
04:54:41.030 --> 04:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
is there any place we can see this
 
04:54:43.490 --> 04:54:43.500 align:start position:0%
capital budget so you have it any place
 
04:54:45.770 --> 04:54:45.780 align:start position:0%
when you see the capital budget you do
 
04:54:47.090 --> 04:54:47.100 align:start position:0%
have the governor's recommended capital
 
04:54:48.830 --> 04:54:48.840 align:start position:0%
budget in your binders and I don't think
 
04:54:52.128 --> 04:54:52.138 align:start position:0%
there was any CTS in there and I don't
 
04:54:54.770 --> 04:54:54.780 align:start position:0%
think public work
 
04:54:57.830 --> 04:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
there's the the only doe Capital project
 
04:54:59.810 --> 04:54:59.820 align:start position:0%
that I recall seeing was relative to
 
04:55:02.150 --> 04:55:02.160 align:start position:0%
acquiring their building
 
04:55:03.830 --> 04:55:03.840 align:start position:0%
to acquiring their building where
 
04:55:05.990 --> 04:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
they're working out of on Hall Street
 
04:55:07.850 --> 04:55:07.860 align:start position:0%
it was a there was a line item to buy
 
04:55:09.230 --> 04:55:09.240 align:start position:0%
the building
 
04:55:11.390 --> 04:55:11.400 align:start position:0%
for doe
 
04:55:11.400 --> 04:55:13.070 align:start position:0%
for doe
yeah

04:55:13.070 --> 04:55:13.080 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
04:55:15.890 --> 04:55:15.900 align:start position:0%
that's I don't think there's any CT
 
04:55:15.900 --> 04:55:16.550 align:start position:0%
that's I don't think there's any CT
um

04:55:16.550 --> 04:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:55:18.110 --> 04:55:18.120 align:start position:0%
projects in the governor's recommended
 
04:55:19.670 --> 04:55:19.680 align:start position:0%
capital budget I'm not sure what work
 
04:55:21.590 --> 04:55:21.600 align:start position:0%
Public Works and highways has done to
 
04:55:23.208 --> 04:55:23.218 align:start position:0%
this point whether they've I know
 
04:55:24.470 --> 04:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
they've heard from the Department on it
 
04:55:25.490 --> 04:55:25.500 align:start position:0%
but I don't think they've made any
 
04:55:27.830 --> 04:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
decisions to add the second one to this
 
04:55:29.390 --> 04:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
point I'll double check with Chris in
 
04:55:30.708 --> 04:55:30.718 align:start position:0%
our office just to see what the status
 
04:55:33.770 --> 04:55:33.780 align:start position:0%
is of their work no no no that's what
 
04:55:34.868 --> 04:55:34.878 align:start position:0%
I'm saying
 
04:55:38.330 --> 04:55:38.340 align:start position:0%
you've got you've got the Sugar River
 
04:55:40.730 --> 04:55:40.740 align:start position:0%
Valley whatever in House Bill 2 paid
 
04:55:42.708 --> 04:55:42.718 align:start position:0%
with education trust funds I don't
 
04:55:43.670 --> 04:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
believe there's anything in the capital
 
04:55:43.680 --> 04:55:44.690 align:start position:0%
believe there's anything in the capital
budget

04:55:44.690 --> 04:55:44.700 align:start position:0%
budget
 
04:55:49.368 --> 04:55:49.378 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:51.350 --> 04:55:51.360 align:start position:0%
that's the big one that's that's the
 
04:56:11.270 --> 04:56:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:11.280 --> 04:56:16.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:56:16.750 --> 04:56:16.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:20.690 --> 04:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
that's all one one in one up yeah
 
04:56:24.788 --> 04:56:24.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:27.708 --> 04:56:27.718 align:start position:0%
we've got 12 different requests from all
 
04:56:30.830 --> 04:56:30.840 align:start position:0%
ctes hey we need money until we decided
 
04:56:32.690 --> 04:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
here's what we're gonna do
 
04:56:35.708 --> 04:56:35.718 align:start position:0%
two of you every two years
 
04:56:39.530 --> 04:56:39.540 align:start position:0%
a list and then they have time to go to
 
04:56:47.470 --> 04:56:47.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:49.670 --> 04:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
I think hope would threw that out the
 
04:56:49.680 --> 04:56:59.410 align:start position:0%
I think hope would threw that out the
window

04:56:59.410 --> 04:56:59.420 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:04.310 --> 04:57:04.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:20.270 --> 04:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:22.310 --> 04:57:22.320 align:start position:0%
yeah but Washington State that's picking
 
04:57:28.550 --> 04:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:30.350 --> 04:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
they are getting
 
04:57:32.830 --> 04:57:32.840 align:start position:0%
we are we talking with more
 
04:57:32.840 --> 04:57:34.490 align:start position:0%
we are we talking with more
oh

04:57:34.490 --> 04:57:34.500 align:start position:0%
oh
 
04:57:34.500 --> 04:57:38.110 align:start position:0%
oh
yeah

04:57:38.110 --> 04:57:38.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:40.430 --> 04:57:40.440 align:start position:0%
nope I was uh thinking still about
 
04:57:42.230 --> 04:57:42.240 align:start position:0%
Twitter more I just missed that portion
 
04:57:43.850 --> 04:57:43.860 align:start position:0%
where we switched my bad no
 
04:57:43.860 --> 04:57:48.230 align:start position:0%
where we switched my bad no
interruptility

04:57:48.230 --> 04:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:05.150 --> 04:58:05.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:07.990 --> 04:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
so well
 
04:58:14.510 --> 04:58:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:41.030 --> 04:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:43.670 --> 04:58:43.680 align:start position:0%
and blockchain crypto is one of the
 
04:58:44.930 --> 04:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
applications the blockchain but
 
04:58:46.490 --> 04:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
blockchain is way more than just the
 
04:58:50.090 --> 04:58:50.100 align:start position:0%
crypto and it's a very common technology
 
04:58:58.610 --> 04:58:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:07.610 --> 04:59:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:09.530 --> 04:59:09.540 align:start position:0%
so we'll hold on the UNH Appropriations
 
04:59:12.470 --> 04:59:12.480 align:start position:0%
for now then by the sounds of it jumping
 
04:59:14.750 --> 04:59:14.760 align:start position:0%
up a couple rows the retirement system
 
04:59:18.708 --> 04:59:18.718 align:start position:0%
eligibility for ccsnh employees so on
 
04:59:20.990 --> 04:59:21.000 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill 2 page two
 
04:59:23.270 --> 04:59:23.280 align:start position:0%
like the front page here page two
 
04:59:25.430 --> 04:59:25.440 align:start position:0%
section six and seven this is where
 
04:59:28.368 --> 04:59:28.378 align:start position:0%
ccsnh has the house bill 2 Chain to
 
04:59:30.410 --> 04:59:30.420 align:start position:0%
change to make any employees after
 
04:59:33.170 --> 04:59:33.180 align:start position:0%
January 1st 2024 not be part of the
 
04:59:41.750 --> 04:59:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:51.230 --> 04:59:51.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:51.240 --> 05:00:00.470 align:start position:0%
 
it changes

05:00:00.470 --> 05:00:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:00.480 --> 05:00:06.170 align:start position:0%
 
70.

05:00:06.170 --> 05:00:06.180 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:16.368 --> 05:00:16.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:18.368 --> 05:00:18.378 align:start position:0%
this would be nice
 
05:00:20.690 --> 05:00:20.700 align:start position:0%
so we'll hold on that one
 
05:00:29.090 --> 05:00:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:32.150 --> 05:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
a few years from now
 
05:00:32.160 --> 05:01:00.890 align:start position:0%
a few years from now
foreign

05:01:00.890 --> 05:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:03.890 --> 05:01:03.900 align:start position:0%
and it's quite often
 
05:01:07.670 --> 05:01:07.680 align:start position:0%
a lot of psychic scene you win those
 
05:01:09.650 --> 05:01:09.660 align:start position:0%
conservatives you've got to get the vote
 
05:01:13.208 --> 05:01:13.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:16.128 --> 05:01:16.138 align:start position:0%
so going to page the third page again
 
05:01:17.690 --> 05:01:17.700 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry for jumping around I'm just
 
05:01:19.610 --> 05:01:19.620 align:start position:0%
trying to pick off what it might be low
 
05:01:20.990 --> 05:01:21.000 align:start position:0%
hanging fruit here
 
05:01:26.390 --> 05:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
uh on lines 19 and 20 the department of
 
05:01:29.330 --> 05:01:29.340 align:start position:0%
safety had asked for uh some fire
 
05:01:30.948 --> 05:01:30.958 align:start position:0%
service instructors and a program
 
05:01:33.110 --> 05:01:33.120 align:start position:0%
assistant in the fire standards and
 
05:01:34.910 --> 05:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
training Emergency Medical Services and
 
05:01:36.788 --> 05:01:36.798 align:start position:0%
the fire safety divisions
 
05:01:40.190 --> 05:01:40.200 align:start position:0%
based on on the page third yep flip to
 
05:01:42.650 --> 05:01:42.660 align:start position:0%
page three there on on lines 19 and 20.
 
05:01:46.128 --> 05:01:46.138 align:start position:0%
so about 790 for both of them and the
 
05:01:47.750 --> 05:01:47.760 align:start position:0%
source of funds for this is the fire
 
05:01:50.570 --> 05:01:50.580 align:start position:0%
fund and based on the actions that we
 
05:01:53.628 --> 05:01:53.638 align:start position:0%
took earlier this week to accept the
 
05:01:55.610 --> 05:01:55.620 align:start position:0%
Authority for the Department of Safety
 
05:01:57.288 --> 05:01:57.298 align:start position:0%
to set the fees that go into the fire
 
05:01:59.868 --> 05:01:59.878 align:start position:0%
fund through rules yeah they they you
 
05:02:01.430 --> 05:02:01.440 align:start position:0%
know I think you can this isn't general
 
05:02:03.288 --> 05:02:03.298 align:start position:0%
or Highway funds so if you're good with
 
05:02:05.448 --> 05:02:05.458 align:start position:0%
establishing these positions from a
 
05:02:07.310 --> 05:02:07.320 align:start position:0%
funding point of view you're good okay
 
05:02:08.750 --> 05:02:08.760 align:start position:0%
we're good yeah
 
05:02:08.760 --> 05:02:09.948 align:start position:0%
we're good yeah
yep

05:02:09.948 --> 05:02:09.958 align:start position:0%
yep
 
05:02:11.868 --> 05:02:11.878 align:start position:0%
yeah I'll I'll enter those so we'll
 
05:02:13.190 --> 05:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
we'll enter those right into house bill
 
05:02:14.990 --> 05:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
one so those will be shaded rose on here
 
05:02:17.810 --> 05:02:17.820 align:start position:0%
now it's one one less item
 
05:02:20.510 --> 05:02:20.520 align:start position:0%
uh I guess while we have this in front
 
05:02:22.910 --> 05:02:22.920 align:start position:0%
of us is it helpful for the committee to
 
05:02:25.250 --> 05:02:25.260 align:start position:0%
go through and if there's something that
 
05:02:26.990 --> 05:02:27.000 align:start position:0%
you you have a consensus that you're not
 
05:02:28.368 --> 05:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
going to do that you're just like yeah
 
05:02:30.890 --> 05:02:30.900 align:start position:0%
take that off this list and and have you
 
05:02:32.750 --> 05:02:32.760 align:start position:0%
more focused so this thing's not so busy
 
05:02:35.448 --> 05:02:35.458 align:start position:0%
every time we meet that's an option or I
 
05:02:37.128 --> 05:02:37.138 align:start position:0%
can still keep everything on here just
 
05:02:39.470 --> 05:02:39.480 align:start position:0%
so you have it in case you want to refer
 
05:02:40.550 --> 05:02:40.560 align:start position:0%
to it
 
05:02:40.560 --> 05:02:42.948 align:start position:0%
to it
um

05:02:42.948 --> 05:02:42.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:44.628 --> 05:02:44.638 align:start position:0%
at the end I'm going to give you a final
 
05:02:46.430 --> 05:02:46.440 align:start position:0%
of everything you've done for sure so
 
05:02:47.930 --> 05:02:47.940 align:start position:0%
it'll be
 
05:02:50.270 --> 05:02:50.280 align:start position:0%
so flip over to page five essentially
 
05:02:52.128 --> 05:02:52.138 align:start position:0%
flip a couple Pages it's that landscape
 
05:02:52.138 --> 05:02:53.810 align:start position:0%
flip a couple Pages it's that landscape
document

05:02:53.810 --> 05:02:53.820 align:start position:0%
document
 
05:02:55.310 --> 05:02:55.320 align:start position:0%
this is where I capture everything
 
05:02:56.510 --> 05:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
you've done
 
05:02:58.250 --> 05:02:58.260 align:start position:0%
you know so I'm keeping this as a
 
05:03:01.128 --> 05:03:01.138 align:start position:0%
running tally of our of uh the changes
 
05:03:03.230 --> 05:03:03.240 align:start position:0%
we've approved to this point
 
05:03:06.708 --> 05:03:06.718 align:start position:0%
but I asked the committee about uh just
 
05:03:09.350 --> 05:03:09.360 align:start position:0%
thought came to mind the uh on the port
 
05:03:10.368 --> 05:03:10.378 align:start position:0%
on the
 
05:03:14.208 --> 05:03:14.218 align:start position:0%
page four hb46a doe contract to recodify
 
05:03:15.948 --> 05:03:15.958 align:start position:0%
education laws
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
do we have a thought on that one because
 
05:03:19.970 --> 05:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
it seemed to me at the time and I'm just
 
05:03:23.208 --> 05:03:23.218 align:start position:0%
sharing my recollection that one hundred
 
05:03:24.948 --> 05:03:24.958 align:start position:0%
thousand was gonna be woefully
 
05:03:27.410 --> 05:03:27.420 align:start position:0%
inadequate and that I don't think the
 
05:03:29.510 --> 05:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill works with this amount and I don't
 
05:03:31.128 --> 05:03:31.138 align:start position:0%
know that we're in a place to spend
 
05:03:33.410 --> 05:03:33.420 align:start position:0%
millions of dollars to do it right so I
 
05:03:34.850 --> 05:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
just wanted to hear where the committee
 
05:03:37.490 --> 05:03:37.500 align:start position:0%
is on 468 I
 
05:03:39.650 --> 05:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
you know it's the again the 100 000 to
 
05:03:41.390 --> 05:03:41.400 align:start position:0%
recodify all the laws and there is no
 
05:03:43.250 --> 05:03:43.260 align:start position:0%
way an attorney is going to get to 1200
 
05:03:43.260 --> 05:03:51.010 align:start position:0%
way an attorney is going to get to 1200
pages

05:03:51.010 --> 05:03:51.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:03:53.510 --> 05:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
the bill is allocating a hundred
 
05:03:55.850 --> 05:03:55.860 align:start position:0%
thousand to re-codify the Department of
 
05:03:57.948 --> 05:03:57.958 align:start position:0%
Education laws which
 
05:04:01.490 --> 05:04:01.500 align:start position:0%
is a woefully inadequate amount for that
 
05:04:03.530 --> 05:04:03.540 align:start position:0%
and I'm not even sure if that project is
 
05:04:05.930 --> 05:04:05.940 align:start position:0%
really something you know well it should
 
05:04:19.750 --> 05:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:22.788 --> 05:04:22.798 align:start position:0%
when we talked about it we said that
 
05:04:26.330 --> 05:04:26.340 align:start position:0%
there are other a number of departments
 
05:04:28.490 --> 05:04:28.500 align:start position:0%
have to do this too that this is
 
05:04:31.128 --> 05:04:31.138 align:start position:0%
something that was a big need and but it
 
05:04:32.570 --> 05:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
took a lot it needs a lot more
 
05:04:34.730 --> 05:04:34.740 align:start position:0%
discussion about how it would get done
 
05:04:37.610 --> 05:04:37.620 align:start position:0%
so maybe it would be best to retain that
 
05:04:37.620 --> 05:04:38.690 align:start position:0%
so maybe it would be best to retain that
bill

05:04:38.690 --> 05:04:38.700 align:start position:0%
bill
 
05:04:41.810 --> 05:04:41.820 align:start position:0%
okay so so we've acted on it
 
05:04:44.030 --> 05:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
so well done all these bills we've acted
 
05:04:45.830 --> 05:04:45.840 align:start position:0%
on they're carried on here just in case
 
05:04:47.330 --> 05:04:47.340 align:start position:0%
you wanted to incorporate them into your
 
05:04:49.430 --> 05:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
budget this is one that we had heard
 
05:04:51.890 --> 05:04:51.900 align:start position:0%
testimony from the office of legislative
 
05:04:54.288 --> 05:04:54.298 align:start position:0%
services that this is going to be a
 
05:04:57.110 --> 05:04:57.120 align:start position:0%
pretty Herculean task and I don't think
 
05:04:58.850 --> 05:04:58.860 align:start position:0%
they've really had a chance just because
 
05:05:00.530 --> 05:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
of the nature of the time of year to
 
05:05:02.448 --> 05:05:02.458 align:start position:0%
really look into this to give any sort
 
05:05:04.490 --> 05:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
of direction for our committee and I
 
05:05:06.650 --> 05:05:06.660 align:start position:0%
think the prime sponsor also was going
 
05:05:07.910 --> 05:05:07.920 align:start position:0%
to check back and we haven't heard from
 
05:05:11.150 --> 05:05:11.160 align:start position:0%
him either so so we are assuming so we
 
05:05:12.948 --> 05:05:12.958 align:start position:0%
are assuming that for the purposes of
 
05:05:14.750 --> 05:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
that budget cycle that will be out we
 
05:05:16.850 --> 05:05:16.860 align:start position:0%
retain it for future action but we are
 
05:05:21.110 --> 05:05:21.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:27.530 --> 05:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:29.990 --> 05:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
I do have a drafted Amendment for the
 
05:05:31.910 --> 05:05:31.920 align:start position:0%
hygiene products amendment that we work
 
05:05:33.530 --> 05:05:33.540 align:start position:0%
through I can pass that around now just
 
05:05:41.690 --> 05:05:41.700 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:41.700 --> 05:05:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
bye

05:05:47.270 --> 05:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:50.570 --> 05:05:50.580 align:start position:0%
the idea that well we told them to do it
 
05:05:54.410 --> 05:05:54.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:56.628 --> 05:05:56.638 align:start position:0%
someone took us to court
 
05:05:59.530 --> 05:05:59.540 align:start position:0%
on the billion dollars that we give to
 
05:06:02.628 --> 05:06:02.638 align:start position:0%
education and said
 
05:06:04.430 --> 05:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
you can't tell me to do that without
 
05:06:06.830 --> 05:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
sending me extra money and it was a
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
small amount of money but they were
 
05:06:10.850 --> 05:06:10.860 align:start position:0%
suing us for it and the court came back
 
05:06:13.970 --> 05:06:13.980 align:start position:0%
and said they gave you a billion dollars
 
05:06:15.708 --> 05:06:15.718 align:start position:0%
if they told you to do something else
 
05:06:17.690 --> 05:06:17.700 align:start position:0%
with it then you're already doing
 
05:06:20.208 --> 05:06:20.218 align:start position:0%
you've got the money don't come suing
 
05:06:22.610 --> 05:06:22.620 align:start position:0%
them for more you can find it in the
 
05:06:25.850 --> 05:06:25.860 align:start position:0%
billion dollars so I would take the same
 
05:06:28.670 --> 05:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
attitude toward that hygiene products
 
05:06:31.070 --> 05:06:31.080 align:start position:0%
that you know don't tell us we should
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
have given you
 
05:06:34.850 --> 05:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
two thousand dollars or something I
 
05:06:37.128 --> 05:06:37.138 align:start position:0%
agree when when you already gave you a
 
05:06:39.170 --> 05:06:39.180 align:start position:0%
billion because that's that's my
 
05:06:40.910 --> 05:06:40.920 align:start position:0%
recollection of what the court decided
 
05:06:43.550 --> 05:06:43.560 align:start position:0%
when you give them a little change and
 
05:06:44.868 --> 05:06:44.878 align:start position:0%
you're already given a billion dollars
 
05:06:46.310 --> 05:06:46.320 align:start position:0%
and they take you to court saying you
 
05:06:48.350 --> 05:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
should give me the 2 000. the court will
 
05:06:50.990 --> 05:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
say take it out of the billion we don't
 
05:06:52.368 --> 05:06:52.378 align:start position:0%
pay for toilets issue
 
05:06:54.590 --> 05:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
that's right
 
05:06:54.600 --> 05:06:55.430 align:start position:0%
that's right
anyway

05:06:55.430 --> 05:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
05:06:59.570 --> 05:06:59.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:59.580 --> 05:07:03.368 align:start position:0%
 
life

05:07:03.368 --> 05:07:03.378 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:06.590 --> 05:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
you're 77 years ago
 
05:07:10.730 --> 05:07:10.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:12.350 --> 05:07:12.360 align:start position:0%
you really have to be supporting early
 
05:07:15.470 --> 05:07:15.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:18.230 --> 05:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
the kids from Vermont
 
05:07:24.970 --> 05:07:24.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:31.190 --> 05:07:31.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:35.570 --> 05:07:35.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:07:39.530 --> 05:07:39.540 align:start position:0%
this all we did basically was take the
 
05:07:44.150 --> 05:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
RSA as it was modified by
 
05:07:46.610 --> 05:07:46.620 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards
 
05:07:50.410 --> 05:07:50.420 align:start position:0%
and unmodified it quite a bit
 
05:07:54.470 --> 05:07:54.480 align:start position:0%
the difference between this one and his
 
05:07:59.270 --> 05:07:59.280 align:start position:0%
was he allocated twelve dollars per
 
05:08:02.628 --> 05:08:02.638 align:start position:0%
Barrel I'll say the girl we have in here
 
05:08:04.850 --> 05:08:04.860 align:start position:0%
administrating persons
 
05:08:04.860 --> 05:08:05.868 align:start position:0%
administrating persons
um

05:08:05.868 --> 05:08:05.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:08:07.730 --> 05:08:07.740 align:start position:0%
he had twelve dollars
 
05:08:10.070 --> 05:08:10.080 align:start position:0%
per student per year and we've dropped
 
05:08:11.270 --> 05:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
it to three
 
05:08:13.448 --> 05:08:13.458 align:start position:0%
he had
 
05:08:15.708 --> 05:08:15.718 align:start position:0%
retroactive payments
 
05:08:18.650 --> 05:08:18.660 align:start position:0%
which we dropped all together yeah
 
05:08:22.430 --> 05:08:22.440 align:start position:0%
that's basically the difference someone
 
05:08:22.440 --> 05:08:24.788 align:start position:0%
that's basically the difference someone
well

05:08:24.788 --> 05:08:24.798 align:start position:0%
well
 
05:08:29.270 --> 05:08:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:31.310 --> 05:08:31.320 align:start position:0%
just leave them alone
 
05:08:34.730 --> 05:08:34.740 align:start position:0%
so a couple I guess thoughts um I'm not
 
05:08:35.990 --> 05:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
going to fall on any I'm not going to
 
05:08:37.430 --> 05:08:37.440 align:start position:0%
fall on a razor blade for this I mean
 
05:08:39.890 --> 05:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
this you know not that significant for
 
05:08:43.730 --> 05:08:43.740 align:start position:0%
me but no I was going to say Blake fall
 
05:08:45.650 --> 05:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
on my sword I figured well like razor
 
05:08:47.690 --> 05:08:47.700 align:start position:0%
blade is much smaller than a sword yeah
 
05:08:51.350 --> 05:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:08:54.170 --> 05:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
um I guess one of the things that comes
 
05:08:56.390 --> 05:08:56.400 align:start position:0%
to my mind uh was when our kids were in
 
05:08:58.310 --> 05:08:58.320 align:start position:0%
school in California and the beginning
 
05:09:00.230 --> 05:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
of the year the teacher would send home
 
05:09:01.730 --> 05:09:01.740 align:start position:0%
kind of a list of requests all the
 
05:09:03.890 --> 05:09:03.900 align:start position:0%
crayons are broken could would a parent
 
05:09:05.628 --> 05:09:05.638 align:start position:0%
be willing to send in you know a couple
 
05:09:07.368 --> 05:09:07.378 align:start position:0%
packages of crayons we don't have enough
 
05:09:09.170 --> 05:09:09.180 align:start position:0%
Kleenex to get through the year would
 
05:09:11.330 --> 05:09:11.340 align:start position:0%
y'all bring in would every family bring
 
05:09:13.010 --> 05:09:13.020 align:start position:0%
in a box of Kleenex you know stuff like
 
05:09:16.550 --> 05:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
that and this kind of falls into that
 
05:09:18.530 --> 05:09:18.540 align:start position:0%
group and I don't want to ask the
 
05:09:20.628 --> 05:09:20.638 align:start position:0%
parents to do this
 
05:09:22.128 --> 05:09:22.138 align:start position:0%
I didn't like you know I certainly
 
05:09:24.110 --> 05:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
brought in my box of Kleenex and my new
 
05:09:25.910 --> 05:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
crayons to my kids but it's not
 
05:09:26.930 --> 05:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
something that I think is really
 
05:09:30.230 --> 05:09:30.240 align:start position:0%
inappropriate to ask parents to do
 
05:09:32.270 --> 05:09:32.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm kind of the same mind I think as
 
05:09:33.708 --> 05:09:33.718 align:start position:0%
the two of you sitting close together
 
05:09:36.288 --> 05:09:36.298 align:start position:0%
over there on this one
 
05:09:38.990 --> 05:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
um with regards to I have
 
05:09:40.910 --> 05:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
I don't have any problem funding it if
 
05:09:43.190 --> 05:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
that's the way we want to go but they do
 
05:09:44.628 --> 05:09:44.638 align:start position:0%
have a big budget and you're talking
 
05:09:47.570 --> 05:09:47.580 align:start position:0%
about a few dollars here and you're they
 
05:09:50.208 --> 05:09:50.218 align:start position:0%
pay the paper towels they pay the toilet
 
05:09:52.490 --> 05:09:52.500 align:start position:0%
paper there's you know any napkins in
 
05:09:53.810 --> 05:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
the kitchen or whatever you know there
 
05:09:56.288 --> 05:09:56.298 align:start position:0%
are any number of things so I said I'm
 
05:09:59.270 --> 05:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
I'm either way on this I'd be happy to
 
05:10:01.010 --> 05:10:01.020 align:start position:0%
support it um I think it's I think it's
 
05:10:02.510 --> 05:10:02.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunate that we had to have the bill
 
05:10:04.010 --> 05:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
in the first place because some schools
 
05:10:06.230 --> 05:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
were not doing this but the bill we
 
05:10:08.270 --> 05:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
passed takes care of that
 
05:10:11.208 --> 05:10:11.218 align:start position:0%
and so as I said I'm of two minds here
 
05:10:20.510 --> 05:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:22.070 --> 05:10:22.080 align:start position:0%
I mean it's sticking it to the ceiling
 
05:10:24.730 --> 05:10:24.740 align:start position:0%
them out of the machine
 
05:10:27.770 --> 05:10:27.780 align:start position:0%
frankly well I think it's not going to
 
05:10:29.330 --> 05:10:29.340 align:start position:0%
change I don't think I think this is a
 
05:10:31.490 --> 05:10:31.500 align:start position:0%
part of Education of those young girls
 
05:10:33.050 --> 05:10:33.060 align:start position:0%
you know at some point you started to
 
05:10:35.750 --> 05:10:35.760 align:start position:0%
behave yourself but
 
05:10:35.760 --> 05:10:37.010 align:start position:0%
behave yourself but
correct

05:10:37.010 --> 05:10:37.020 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:10:39.288 --> 05:10:39.298 align:start position:0%
the the issue is that the statute
 
05:10:41.030 --> 05:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
specifically said available in the
 
05:10:42.830 --> 05:10:42.840 align:start position:0%
bathrooms right if I recall correctly
 
05:10:44.208 --> 05:10:44.218 align:start position:0%
and that's what leads to the waste
 
05:10:45.948 --> 05:10:45.958 align:start position:0%
because there is no adult supervision in
 
05:10:48.650 --> 05:10:48.660 align:start position:0%
the bathroom and kids will be kids so
 
05:10:51.410 --> 05:10:51.420 align:start position:0%
honestly the question is if the waste is
 
05:10:53.208 --> 05:10:53.218 align:start position:0%
significant whether maybe the house
 
05:10:55.670 --> 05:10:55.680 align:start position:0%
should consider going back to making the
 
05:10:57.948 --> 05:10:57.958 align:start position:0%
products available without specifying in
 
05:10:59.930 --> 05:10:59.940 align:start position:0%
the bathrooms but again there were
 
05:11:01.730 --> 05:11:01.740 align:start position:0%
considerations and reasons why that bill
 
05:11:03.708 --> 05:11:03.718 align:start position:0%
is passed so I don't want to get into a
 
05:11:08.510 --> 05:11:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:08.520 --> 05:11:34.310 align:start position:0%
 
together

05:11:34.310 --> 05:11:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:36.288 --> 05:11:36.298 align:start position:0%
and you do all this and then you look up
 
05:11:37.970 --> 05:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
on the mirror and kiss the mirror right
 
05:11:40.070 --> 05:11:40.080 align:start position:0%
when they are custodian when they saw
 
05:11:41.990 --> 05:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
him doing it went over and said I'm
 
05:11:43.250 --> 05:11:43.260 align:start position:0%
going to clean these mirrors off I'm
 
05:11:46.550 --> 05:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
going to put it drag into the toilet got
 
05:11:48.100 --> 05:11:48.110 align:start position:0%
to wet and whatever
 
05:11:48.110 --> 05:11:53.770 align:start position:0%
to wet and whatever
[Laughter]

05:11:53.770 --> 05:11:53.780 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
05:12:03.050 --> 05:12:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:04.368 --> 05:12:04.378 align:start position:0%
well do you want to wait till we have
 
05:12:12.650 --> 05:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:12.660 --> 05:12:14.050 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:12:14.050 --> 05:12:14.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:12:17.208 --> 05:12:17.218 align:start position:0%
it's just are they going to start asking
 
05:12:19.128 --> 05:12:19.138 align:start position:0%
for paper because they don't give them
 
05:12:22.330 --> 05:12:22.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:26.930 --> 05:12:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:28.430 --> 05:12:28.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know all those other things
 
05:12:29.448 --> 05:12:29.458 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm
 
05:12:33.708 --> 05:12:33.718 align:start position:0%
the racers pencils people no no I'm
 
05:12:35.750 --> 05:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
saying that we've specified that they
 
05:12:38.570 --> 05:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
have to have do we specify they have to
 
05:12:41.270 --> 05:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
have paper and pencils
 
05:12:41.280 --> 05:13:12.730 align:start position:0%
have paper and pencils
States

05:13:12.730 --> 05:13:12.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:16.190 --> 05:13:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:18.650 --> 05:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
oh here's here's the person though I
 
05:13:22.190 --> 05:13:22.200 align:start position:0%
wasn't this is this was Pat enacted when
 
05:13:23.930 --> 05:13:23.940 align:start position:0%
I was on vacation
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
so I didn't hear any of the
 
05:13:26.868 --> 05:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
deliberations or anything about this
 
05:13:29.030 --> 05:13:29.040 align:start position:0%
would you want to raise up would you
 
05:13:32.570 --> 05:13:32.580 align:start position:0%
want three then no I was at home oh
 
05:13:35.390 --> 05:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
yeah but it was you would you assigned a
 
05:13:39.890 --> 05:13:39.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:39.900 --> 05:13:47.570 align:start position:0%
 
so

05:13:47.570 --> 05:13:47.580 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:49.910 --> 05:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
my attitude is is get rid of the whole
 
05:13:49.920 --> 05:13:51.530 align:start position:0%
my attitude is is get rid of the whole
thing

05:13:51.530 --> 05:13:51.540 align:start position:0%
thing
 
05:13:54.890 --> 05:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
what's up but well I got 28 age but the
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
issue was
 
05:13:59.150 --> 05:13:59.160 align:start position:0%
there were testimony that said some
 
05:14:02.750 --> 05:14:02.760 align:start position:0%
young women were staying home a week a a
 
05:14:02.760 --> 05:14:04.628 align:start position:0%
young women were staying home a week a a
month

05:14:04.628 --> 05:14:04.638 align:start position:0%
month
 
05:14:08.150 --> 05:14:08.160 align:start position:0%
because of non-availability the issue
 
05:14:10.010 --> 05:14:10.020 align:start position:0%
seems to what I'm hearing is that the
 
05:14:11.690 --> 05:14:11.700 align:start position:0%
problem is have the the phrase of keep
 
05:14:14.810 --> 05:14:14.820 align:start position:0%
having it available in the bathroom and
 
05:14:17.810 --> 05:14:17.820 align:start position:0%
just having the bill without that phrase
 
05:14:19.310 --> 05:14:19.320 align:start position:0%
sort of covers they have to have these
 
05:14:21.170 --> 05:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
materials available but not specify that
 
05:14:23.208 --> 05:14:23.218 align:start position:0%
it's the bathroom because many schools
 
05:14:25.550 --> 05:14:25.560 align:start position:0%
use the gym teacher or the nurse or you
 
05:14:27.110 --> 05:14:27.120 align:start position:0%
know one of those but the issue was some
 
05:14:29.868 --> 05:14:29.878 align:start position:0%
schools simply not doing it at all but
 
05:14:31.430 --> 05:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
putting it in the bathroom I think has
 
05:14:35.930 --> 05:14:35.940 align:start position:0%
caused the hiccup here no well
 
05:14:38.750 --> 05:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
but here's the thing though as somebody
 
05:14:40.850 --> 05:14:40.860 align:start position:0%
who raised two girls or is in the
 
05:14:42.410 --> 05:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
process of
 
05:14:46.310 --> 05:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
there is definitely a awkwardness and
 
05:14:49.788 --> 05:14:49.798 align:start position:0%
the discouragement if kids have to go to
 
05:14:52.190 --> 05:14:52.200 align:start position:0%
the nurse's office for this while I
 
05:14:54.410 --> 05:14:54.420 align:start position:0%
agree that bathroom is not a good place
 
05:14:56.868 --> 05:14:56.878 align:start position:0%
to put them if we are gonna Tinker with
 
05:14:58.910 --> 05:14:58.920 align:start position:0%
a language which is fine
 
05:15:01.750 --> 05:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that we put something
 
05:15:04.250 --> 05:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
that cannot be interpreted to just going
 
05:15:06.350 --> 05:15:06.360 align:start position:0%
back right to the nurse's office you
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
know available through other teachers or
 
05:15:11.030 --> 05:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
counselors or you know it's got to be
 
05:15:13.070 --> 05:15:13.080 align:start position:0%
somebody that the kid is not afraid of
 
05:15:14.810 --> 05:15:14.820 align:start position:0%
going to or not embarrassed by uh
 
05:15:17.690 --> 05:15:17.700 align:start position:0%
because trust me kids are vicious
 
05:15:20.330 --> 05:15:20.340 align:start position:0%
sometimes you go to the nurse's office
 
05:15:22.010 --> 05:15:22.020 align:start position:0%
and everybody's gonna make all the kind
 
05:15:24.110 --> 05:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
of jokes about you know your time of the
 
05:15:26.628 --> 05:15:26.638 align:start position:0%
month and the whole point is to avoid
 
05:15:29.150 --> 05:15:29.160 align:start position:0%
that right so we got to be careful if we
 
05:15:30.948 --> 05:15:30.958 align:start position:0%
play with a language to not recreate
 
05:15:33.948 --> 05:15:33.958 align:start position:0%
that issue which is real for girls you
 
05:15:36.770 --> 05:15:36.780 align:start position:0%
know in high in schools so
 
05:15:39.470 --> 05:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
you know it can be other trusted people
 
05:15:41.810 --> 05:15:41.820 align:start position:0%
you know teachers counselors whatever it
 
05:15:43.368 --> 05:15:43.378 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be a trip to the nurses
 
05:15:44.750 --> 05:15:44.760 align:start position:0%
I'm fine with removing it from the
 
05:15:47.510 --> 05:15:47.520 align:start position:0%
bathroom but I urge you to be careful if
 
05:15:49.550 --> 05:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
we play with a language to not go back
 
05:15:51.708 --> 05:15:51.718 align:start position:0%
to just a nurse's office even on
 
05:15:58.310 --> 05:15:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:59.810 --> 05:15:59.820 align:start position:0%
interesting that we would be talking
 
05:16:15.850 --> 05:16:15.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:19.550 --> 05:16:19.560 align:start position:0%
we talk further about it his Amendment
 
05:16:22.190 --> 05:16:22.200 align:start position:0%
eliminated the bathroom specifications
 
05:16:24.830 --> 05:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay isn't that what my amendment is no
 
05:16:27.110 --> 05:16:27.120 align:start position:0%
no this one has the bathroom
 
05:16:27.120 --> 05:16:28.850 align:start position:0%
no this one has the bathroom
specifications

05:16:28.850 --> 05:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
specifications
 
05:16:30.708 --> 05:16:30.718 align:start position:0%
still in
 
05:16:30.718 --> 05:16:32.390 align:start position:0%
still in
okay

05:16:32.390 --> 05:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:16:35.990 --> 05:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
the reason I did my amendment was
 
05:16:39.190 --> 05:16:39.200 align:start position:0%
why are we micromanaging schools right
 
05:16:42.530 --> 05:16:42.540 align:start position:0%
but do we know better what goes on in
 
05:16:45.110 --> 05:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
schools than they themselves know
 
05:16:46.868 --> 05:16:46.878 align:start position:0%
right I mean
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
principals and teachers and everybody
 
05:16:51.708 --> 05:16:51.718 align:start position:0%
they they're the ones who run the school
 
05:16:53.948 --> 05:16:53.958 align:start position:0%
so you tell them
 
05:16:56.390 --> 05:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
here's some you know money for you and
 
05:16:58.670 --> 05:16:58.680 align:start position:0%
and here's something to do with it let
 
05:17:00.530 --> 05:17:00.540 align:start position:0%
them do it let them figure out what
 
05:17:02.390 --> 05:17:02.400 align:start position:0%
works for them and what doesn't you know
 
05:17:04.970 --> 05:17:04.980 align:start position:0%
that's all why why do we have to we
 
05:17:06.590 --> 05:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to be that detailed on
 
05:17:08.270 --> 05:17:08.280 align:start position:0%
something like this that's that that's
 
05:17:16.330 --> 05:17:16.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:24.250 --> 05:17:24.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:33.708 --> 05:17:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:33.718 --> 05:17:43.810 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:17:43.810 --> 05:17:43.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:55.250 --> 05:17:55.260 align:start position:0%
it is yeah so of all the things I
 
05:17:57.770 --> 05:17:57.780 align:start position:0%
thought I'd ever be talking about
 
05:17:59.690 --> 05:17:59.700 align:start position:0%
I didn't start this
 
05:18:02.930 --> 05:18:02.940 align:start position:0%
all right but this being said I mean if
 
05:18:02.940 --> 05:18:04.368 align:start position:0%
all right but this being said I mean if
we

05:18:04.368 --> 05:18:04.378 align:start position:0%
we
 
05:18:07.310 --> 05:18:07.320 align:start position:0%
amend the existing statute to
 
05:18:09.170 --> 05:18:09.180 align:start position:0%
change it so that they are easily
 
05:18:11.330 --> 05:18:11.340 align:start position:0%
available but not require them in the to
 
05:18:13.128 --> 05:18:13.138 align:start position:0%
be in the bathroom I think that whole
 
05:18:14.810 --> 05:18:14.820 align:start position:0%
unfunded mandate problem goes away
 
05:18:16.368 --> 05:18:16.378 align:start position:0%
because really the objection was to the
 
05:18:16.378 --> 05:18:17.270 align:start position:0%
because really the objection was to the
waste

05:18:17.270 --> 05:18:17.280 align:start position:0%
waste
 
05:18:19.368 --> 05:18:19.378 align:start position:0%
from having them in an unsupervised
 
05:18:21.110 --> 05:18:21.120 align:start position:0%
location I don't remember you know
 
05:18:22.730 --> 05:18:22.740 align:start position:0%
that's what I remember if I would
 
05:18:24.948 --> 05:18:24.958 align:start position:0%
appreciate if somebody corrected me if
 
05:18:28.670 --> 05:18:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:28.680 --> 05:18:31.430 align:start position:0%
 
like

05:18:31.430 --> 05:18:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:32.990 --> 05:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
maybe we should wait for the full
 
05:18:33.000 --> 05:18:38.890 align:start position:0%
maybe we should wait for the full
committee

05:18:38.890 --> 05:18:38.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:41.448 --> 05:18:41.458 align:start position:0%
it was it was just it was really just
 
05:18:43.610 --> 05:18:43.620 align:start position:0%
that one line that specifies the
 
05:18:46.670 --> 05:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
bathroom yeah if you if you crossed out
 
05:18:48.470 --> 05:18:48.480 align:start position:0%
it said basically just make them
 
05:18:52.730 --> 05:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:55.250 --> 05:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
available at no cost
 
05:18:58.128 --> 05:18:58.138 align:start position:0%
and probably middle and high school and
 
05:19:01.490 --> 05:19:01.500 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting you're putting it
 
05:19:03.070 --> 05:19:03.080 align:start position:0%
at the elementary
 
05:19:10.010 --> 05:19:10.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:13.128 --> 05:19:13.138 align:start position:0%
hang on could we see in schools you know
 
05:19:13.138 --> 05:19:14.270 align:start position:0%
hang on could we see in schools you know
with

05:19:14.270 --> 05:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:19:18.490 --> 05:19:18.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:21.050 --> 05:19:21.060 align:start position:0%
we are gonna get in trouble when
 
05:19:23.330 --> 05:19:23.340 align:start position:0%
somebody's gonna have to stock uh you
 
05:19:24.770 --> 05:19:24.780 align:start position:0%
know uh
 
05:19:27.470 --> 05:19:27.480 align:start position:0%
menstruating products in a kindergarten
 
05:19:29.750 --> 05:19:29.760 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have the rest of it I'm
 
05:19:31.368 --> 05:19:31.378 align:start position:0%
just saying Public Schools is a very
 
05:19:33.470 --> 05:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
broad term I would suggest if we are
 
05:19:35.510 --> 05:19:35.520 align:start position:0%
gonna change the language to have
 
05:19:37.128 --> 05:19:37.138 align:start position:0%
language that addresses representative
 
05:19:39.288 --> 05:19:39.298 align:start position:0%
Lads point that younger kids than Middle
 
05:19:41.868 --> 05:19:41.878 align:start position:0%
School can menstruate but I I wouldn't
 
05:19:43.610 --> 05:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
want to make it super broad to avoid
 
05:19:43.620 --> 05:19:49.850 align:start position:0%
want to make it super broad to avoid
waste

05:19:49.850 --> 05:19:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:52.490 --> 05:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
like what that's what I'm saying I mean
 
05:20:07.430 --> 05:20:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:09.948 --> 05:20:09.958 align:start position:0%
and bathroom designer
 
05:20:14.390 --> 05:20:14.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:16.250 --> 05:20:16.260 align:start position:0%
what do we
 
05:20:17.930 --> 05:20:17.940 align:start position:0%
Mary doesn't want to Pony up to three
 
05:20:19.788 --> 05:20:19.798 align:start position:0%
bucks per
 
05:20:19.798 --> 05:20:24.410 align:start position:0%
bucks per
yes

05:20:24.410 --> 05:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:27.770 --> 05:20:27.780 align:start position:0%
I do I do agree though with the point
 
05:20:29.628 --> 05:20:29.638 align:start position:0%
made by representative Heath earlier
 
05:20:29.638 --> 05:20:30.770 align:start position:0%
made by representative Heath earlier
that

05:20:30.770 --> 05:20:30.780 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:20:33.470 --> 05:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
it's probably better to remove the
 
05:20:35.690 --> 05:20:35.700 align:start position:0%
perceived unfunded mandate which is
 
05:20:38.170 --> 05:20:38.180 align:start position:0%
related to that waste than to start
 
05:20:40.128 --> 05:20:40.138 align:start position:0%
appropriating for every little thing
 
05:20:41.868 --> 05:20:41.878 align:start position:0%
that we ask of schools at the end of the
 
05:20:43.910 --> 05:20:43.920 align:start position:0%
day that's what the you know big budget
 
05:20:49.970 --> 05:20:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:49.980 --> 05:21:09.470 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:21:09.470 --> 05:21:09.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:12.410 --> 05:21:12.420 align:start position:0%
so do away with the whole thing
 
05:21:12.420 --> 05:21:14.090 align:start position:0%
so do away with the whole thing
I

05:21:14.090 --> 05:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
I
 
05:21:17.270 --> 05:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
so you're you're against Mary
 
05:21:19.250 --> 05:21:19.260 align:start position:0%
the the you want to do away with the
 
05:21:20.690 --> 05:21:20.700 align:start position:0%
whole thing so we don't have a 28-day
 
05:21:25.670 --> 05:21:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:29.590 --> 05:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:32.330 --> 05:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
do you just want to get rid of the money
 
05:21:35.868 --> 05:21:35.878 align:start position:0%
steps now you get a 28 day issue even
 
05:21:41.270 --> 05:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:43.010 --> 05:21:43.020 align:start position:0%
I can't remember these there
 
05:21:45.230 --> 05:21:45.240 align:start position:0%
getting a huge they're all getting a big
 
05:21:46.910 --> 05:21:46.920 align:start position:0%
they've already got a big budget already
 
05:21:49.010 --> 05:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
and this is not a significant amount to
 
05:21:51.410 --> 05:21:51.420 align:start position:0%
that and we're already funding yeah so
 
05:21:53.690 --> 05:21:53.700 align:start position:0%
it's not on concept but uh we don't you
 
05:21:55.430 --> 05:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
know it's not unfunded we're giving them
 
05:21:56.810 --> 05:21:56.820 align:start position:0%
plenty of funding it's up to them to
 
05:21:59.590 --> 05:21:59.600 align:start position:0%
decide how to appropriate their funding
 
05:22:02.930 --> 05:22:02.940 align:start position:0%
so it's not a 28a violation then no no
 
05:22:02.940 --> 05:22:05.510 align:start position:0%
so it's not a 28a violation then no no
okay

05:22:05.510 --> 05:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:22:09.530 --> 05:22:09.540 align:start position:0%
so that's so we Mickey you got that
 
05:22:09.540 --> 05:22:11.288 align:start position:0%
so that's so we Mickey you got that
so

05:22:11.288 --> 05:22:11.298 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:22:14.750 --> 05:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
say no what what that you're not going
 
05:22:17.390 --> 05:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
to adopt an amendment yeah I think I got
 
05:22:20.510 --> 05:22:20.520 align:start position:0%
that okay good yeah so we'll we'll put
 
05:22:22.610 --> 05:22:22.620 align:start position:0%
this aside no wait wait wait but we were
 
05:22:25.070 --> 05:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
going to take out the in all gender
 
05:22:27.288 --> 05:22:27.298 align:start position:0%
neutral bathrooms and we're getting it
 
05:22:29.330 --> 05:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
taking out the bathroom language the
 
05:22:30.530 --> 05:22:30.540 align:start position:0%
school district shall make menstrual
 
05:22:33.890 --> 05:22:33.900 align:start position:0%
hygiene products available at no cost
 
05:22:36.350 --> 05:22:36.360 align:start position:0%
for females located for females
 
05:22:40.490 --> 05:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
attending public middle and high schools
 
05:22:42.650 --> 05:22:42.660 align:start position:0%
middle and high school how about just
 
05:22:45.770 --> 05:22:45.780 align:start position:0%
Public Schools I would be fine with that
 
05:22:49.368 --> 05:22:49.378 align:start position:0%
that works and apropos what you're
 
05:22:51.050 --> 05:22:51.060 align:start position:0%
saying if it's a you know you're not
 
05:22:52.430 --> 05:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
going to put them in the kindergarten if
 
05:22:54.050 --> 05:22:54.060 align:start position:0%
there's no one there to use it but this
 
05:22:56.150 --> 05:22:56.160 align:start position:0%
is such an important teacher has need of
 
05:22:57.650 --> 05:22:57.660 align:start position:0%
it the fourth grade teacher who will
 
05:23:02.930 --> 05:23:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:05.208 --> 05:23:05.218 align:start position:0%
but I mean seriously we say all public
 
05:23:06.590 --> 05:23:06.600 align:start position:0%
schools we are going to run straight
 
05:23:09.948 --> 05:23:09.958 align:start position:0%
into you know K through two schools now
 
05:23:12.110 --> 05:23:12.120 align:start position:0%
having to start really yeah lots of
 
05:23:19.910 --> 05:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:22.970 --> 05:23:22.980 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm saying I would it needs
 
05:23:24.830 --> 05:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
to be qualified Beyond Public Schools if
 
05:23:29.330 --> 05:23:29.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:33.470 --> 05:23:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:33.480 --> 05:23:40.390 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:23:40.390 --> 05:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:43.070 --> 05:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
there's discourse to be had when some
 
05:23:44.390 --> 05:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
other areas there's not a whole lot of
 
05:23:46.250 --> 05:23:46.260 align:start position:0%
discourse going on
 
05:23:47.930 --> 05:23:47.940 align:start position:0%
um what if you you know
 
05:23:51.050 --> 05:23:51.060 align:start position:0%
um amended the females of available at
 
05:23:53.570 --> 05:23:53.580 align:start position:0%
no cost for menstruating females in
 
05:23:56.350 --> 05:23:56.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:59.448 --> 05:23:59.458 align:start position:0%
that would work perfectly fine that's my
 
05:24:01.670 --> 05:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
point you gotta narrow it down to the
 
05:24:03.830 --> 05:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
population so we avoid
 
05:24:06.470 --> 05:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know the uh
 
05:24:08.150 --> 05:24:08.160 align:start position:0%
and honestly I think the current
 
05:24:10.190 --> 05:24:10.200 align:start position:0%
language is menstruating menstruating
 
05:24:14.590 --> 05:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:16.910 --> 05:24:16.920 align:start position:0%
instead of penetrating females what
 
05:24:17.948 --> 05:24:17.958 align:start position:0%
should we use menstruating
 
05:24:21.128 --> 05:24:21.138 align:start position:0%
administrating students
 
05:24:23.628 --> 05:24:23.638 align:start position:0%
because then you'll avoid them yeah they
 
05:24:26.090 --> 05:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
get enough money to supply I think
 
05:24:29.330 --> 05:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
students is more specific the 28a just
 
05:24:30.948 --> 05:24:30.958 align:start position:0%
went away was technically menstruating
 
05:24:32.570 --> 05:24:32.580 align:start position:0%
the person would apply to staff too
 
05:24:34.250 --> 05:24:34.260 align:start position:0%
unless it's already in order to provide
 
05:24:37.868 --> 05:24:37.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:39.948 --> 05:24:39.958 align:start position:0%
so what do we decide we're going to call
 
05:24:42.110 --> 05:24:42.120 align:start position:0%
these people I think it was menstruating
 
05:24:46.850 --> 05:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:46.860 --> 05:24:55.250 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

05:24:55.250 --> 05:24:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:57.470 --> 05:24:57.480 align:start position:0%
and is there any
 
05:24:59.390 --> 05:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
thought on you know how we make sure
 
05:25:01.070 --> 05:25:01.080 align:start position:0%
that this is not going all the way back
 
05:25:02.510 --> 05:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
to square one where this was just
 
05:25:04.190 --> 05:25:04.200 align:start position:0%
available at the North nurse and the
 
05:25:07.250 --> 05:25:07.260 align:start position:0%
walk-up shame to the nurse's office
 
05:25:08.750 --> 05:25:08.760 align:start position:0%
I mean
 
05:25:11.750 --> 05:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
that was available let them figure
 
05:25:13.670 --> 05:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I think that that's a school policy
 
05:25:15.650 --> 05:25:15.660 align:start position:0%
and the problem that this addressed
 
05:25:17.390 --> 05:25:17.400 align:start position:0%
wasn't that exactly it was that nothing
 
05:25:19.670 --> 05:25:19.680 align:start position:0%
was available nothing was available just
 
05:25:21.948 --> 05:25:21.958 align:start position:0%
bringing up potential concerns because
 
05:25:21.958 --> 05:25:22.970 align:start position:0%
bringing up potential concerns because
again

05:25:22.970 --> 05:25:22.980 align:start position:0%
again
 
05:25:32.208 --> 05:25:32.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:35.868 --> 05:25:35.878 align:start position:0%
on Friday afternoon at 3 30 at 3 30. so
 
05:25:37.670 --> 05:25:37.680 align:start position:0%
so in in just a
 
05:25:40.310 --> 05:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
just to remind everyone so we retained
 
05:25:44.090 --> 05:25:44.100 align:start position:0%
this bill for fiscal reasons
 
05:25:46.190 --> 05:25:46.200 align:start position:0%
we retain this bill for fiscal reasons
 
05:25:48.890 --> 05:25:48.900 align:start position:0%
and now has no fiscal impact right yeah
 
05:25:50.690 --> 05:25:50.700 align:start position:0%
that's right we're doing
 
05:25:50.700 --> 05:25:51.288 align:start position:0%
that's right we're doing
um

05:25:51.288 --> 05:25:51.298 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:25:53.990 --> 05:25:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's still within the you know our
 
05:25:55.430 --> 05:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
Authority if you wanted to schedule
 
05:25:58.190 --> 05:25:58.200 align:start position:0%
another work session on
 
05:26:01.490 --> 05:26:01.500 align:start position:0%
House Bill 129 with this amendment and
 
05:26:03.410 --> 05:26:03.420 align:start position:0%
keep it out of House Bill 2 and not
 
05:26:04.610 --> 05:26:04.620 align:start position:0%
retain it and have to deal with it in
 
05:26:06.830 --> 05:26:06.840 align:start position:0%
the summer or we still can put this
 
05:26:08.208 --> 05:26:08.218 align:start position:0%
amendment in-house Bill to even though
 
05:26:10.070 --> 05:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
it has no fiscal implications
 
05:26:12.590 --> 05:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
either way is acceptable it's really up
 
05:26:15.410 --> 05:26:15.420 align:start position:0%
to the committee
 
05:26:17.750 --> 05:26:17.760 align:start position:0%
split it out so in that case I'll work
 
05:26:20.150 --> 05:26:20.160 align:start position:0%
with Janet to post a notice because we
 
05:26:22.010 --> 05:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
we've got a few others that we retained
 
05:26:25.070 --> 05:26:25.080 align:start position:0%
but you may realize you don't they're
 
05:26:26.810 --> 05:26:26.820 align:start position:0%
not going to be part of House Bill too
 
05:26:29.390 --> 05:26:29.400 align:start position:0%
so and we can talk Mr chair if we want
 
05:26:31.128 --> 05:26:31.138 align:start position:0%
to identify a couple another one that
 
05:26:33.830 --> 05:26:33.840 align:start position:0%
jumps to mind is the house bill 638
 
05:26:35.390 --> 05:26:35.400 align:start position:0%
relative to the extraordinary needs
 
05:26:36.890 --> 05:26:36.900 align:start position:0%
Grant accountability plan that was
 
05:26:38.390 --> 05:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
something that we talked about today
 
05:26:39.948 --> 05:26:39.958 align:start position:0%
depending on what you do with that that
 
05:26:41.810 --> 05:26:41.820 align:start position:0%
bill may be able to be dealt with on its
 
05:26:43.128 --> 05:26:43.138 align:start position:0%
own since it's not going to be probably
 
05:26:46.430 --> 05:26:46.440 align:start position:0%
part of House Bill too we know now
 
05:26:46.440 --> 05:26:48.170 align:start position:0%
part of House Bill too we know now
nope

05:26:48.170 --> 05:26:48.180 align:start position:0%
nope
 
05:26:50.750 --> 05:26:50.760 align:start position:0%
uh no no it doesn't
 
05:26:53.090 --> 05:26:53.100 align:start position:0%
so but I'll we can talk we can talk
 
05:26:55.250 --> 05:26:55.260 align:start position:0%
after about that but we talked earlier
 
05:26:57.530 --> 05:26:57.540 align:start position:0%
about extraordinary needs reporting
 
05:27:01.390 --> 05:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
correct and said
 
05:27:06.470 --> 05:27:06.480 align:start position:0%
recently italed it right correct to take
 
05:27:08.150 --> 05:27:08.160 align:start position:0%
that will go in House Bill too okay
 
05:27:09.948 --> 05:27:09.958 align:start position:0%
we'll keep that in the house I'm asking
 
05:27:13.190 --> 05:27:13.200 align:start position:0%
the question as much yes yes yes but yes
 
05:27:15.230 --> 05:27:15.240 align:start position:0%
that's uh we'll we'll stick with that
 
05:27:16.910 --> 05:27:16.920 align:start position:0%
and with House Bill too and I'm just
 
05:27:19.070 --> 05:27:19.080 align:start position:0%
saying well we can still retain it if
 
05:27:21.590 --> 05:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
you want as well just we'll deal with it
 
05:27:29.270 --> 05:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:31.970 --> 05:27:31.980 align:start position:0%
I only have a couple other things if you
 
05:27:32.868 --> 05:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
I don't know how much of a break you
 
05:27:35.690 --> 05:27:35.700 align:start position:0%
want before your meeting later let's get
 
05:27:39.170 --> 05:27:39.180 align:start position:0%
her done okay uh I let me see I'll pass
 
05:27:41.570 --> 05:27:41.580 align:start position:0%
this letter out uh chairman Emrick and
 
05:27:43.190 --> 05:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
the committee got a letter from uh
 
05:27:45.050 --> 05:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
councilor Kenny
 
05:27:54.110 --> 05:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:57.410 --> 05:27:57.420 align:start position:0%
what's up when I increase it I don't
 
05:27:59.448 --> 05:27:59.458 align:start position:0%
want no freaking trains no it's not
 
05:28:02.208 --> 05:28:02.218 align:start position:0%
trained this is like coaches oh in the
 
05:28:03.948 --> 05:28:03.958 align:start position:0%
old Coast
 
05:28:03.958 --> 05:28:06.770 align:start position:0%
old Coast
yeah

05:28:06.770 --> 05:28:06.780 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:28:09.590 --> 05:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
oh okay all right
 
05:28:11.330 --> 05:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
yeah they name them here
 
05:28:13.368 --> 05:28:13.378 align:start position:0%
Tri-County Transit North Country
 
05:28:33.610 --> 05:28:33.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:36.470 --> 05:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure what the match rate is and
 
05:28:38.330 --> 05:28:38.340 align:start position:0%
if the match is consistent over all the
 
05:28:40.850 --> 05:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
dollars but if you recall the department
 
05:28:43.910 --> 05:28:43.920 align:start position:0%
did bring this in as part of their uh
 
05:28:46.070 --> 05:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
division of Aeronautics Rail and Transit
 
05:28:48.288 --> 05:28:48.298 align:start position:0%
requests on
 
05:28:51.288 --> 05:28:51.298 align:start position:0%
on our tracking sheet packet on page
 
05:28:52.788 --> 05:28:52.798 align:start position:0%
three of this
 
05:28:54.230 --> 05:28:54.240 align:start position:0%
if you go to the Department of
 
05:28:56.930 --> 05:28:56.940 align:start position:0%
Transportation on line 38 you'll see the
 
05:28:58.850 --> 05:28:58.860 align:start position:0%
corresponding increase that would fund
 
05:29:04.930 --> 05:29:04.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:09.830 --> 05:29:09.840 align:start position:0%
the 1.8 on top of what is our page three
 
05:29:12.110 --> 05:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
page three line
 
05:29:12.120 --> 05:29:19.670 align:start position:0%
page three line
38.

05:29:19.670 --> 05:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:21.350 --> 05:29:21.360 align:start position:0%
so they
 
05:29:23.690 --> 05:29:23.700 align:start position:0%
uh there's already about a million in
 
05:29:24.590 --> 05:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
05:29:26.868 --> 05:29:26.878 align:start position:0%
so this additional 1.8 would bring it up
 
05:29:28.368 --> 05:29:28.378 align:start position:0%
to the amount that's requested which I
 
05:29:30.708 --> 05:29:30.718 align:start position:0%
think was like 2.75 million I'm just
 
05:29:36.708 --> 05:29:36.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:39.550 --> 05:29:39.560 align:start position:0%
I got left off the list no that's stupid
 
05:29:42.650 --> 05:29:42.660 align:start position:0%
no that's pretty it's Representatives oh
 
05:29:45.770 --> 05:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
organs on there all the whole delegation
 
05:29:48.410 --> 05:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
it lets me on some of it huh well I feel
 
05:29:51.770 --> 05:29:51.780 align:start position:0%
rejected if you have it look at this oh
 
05:29:54.288 --> 05:29:54.298 align:start position:0%
it's right there it's organ I actually
 
05:29:58.610 --> 05:29:58.620 align:start position:0%
met with uh the transportation provider
 
05:30:01.070 --> 05:30:01.080 align:start position:0%
that works
 
05:30:05.510 --> 05:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:08.868 --> 05:30:08.878 align:start position:0%
no this is this is me gentlemen can we
 
05:30:12.410 --> 05:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:12.420 --> 05:30:14.208 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:30:14.208 --> 05:30:14.218 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:30:16.310 --> 05:30:16.320 align:start position:0%
and what what's happened
 
05:30:19.910 --> 05:30:19.920 align:start position:0%
is these Transportation companies are
 
05:30:22.128 --> 05:30:22.138 align:start position:0%
doing a lot of medical transportation
 
05:30:24.170 --> 05:30:24.180 align:start position:0%
senior transportation
 
05:30:26.030 --> 05:30:26.040 align:start position:0%
and they do get some federal
 
05:30:28.730 --> 05:30:28.740 align:start position:0%
reimbursement but it's insufficient for
 
05:30:30.410 --> 05:30:30.420 align:start position:0%
what they're required to do
 
05:30:33.410 --> 05:30:33.420 align:start position:0%
so every time they go on a federal run
 
05:30:34.970 --> 05:30:34.980 align:start position:0%
they get a little bit of money but it
 
05:30:36.948 --> 05:30:36.958 align:start position:0%
costs more so the better they do the
 
05:30:38.708 --> 05:30:38.718 align:start position:0%
worse off they are
 
05:30:43.010 --> 05:30:43.020 align:start position:0%
sounds like a good Federal program to me
 
05:30:45.288 --> 05:30:45.298 align:start position:0%
so that's why they they were soliciting
 
05:30:48.110 --> 05:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
to increase the allocation I think
 
05:30:49.730 --> 05:30:49.740 align:start position:0%
there's seven of these
 
05:30:51.830 --> 05:30:51.840 align:start position:0%
Transportation companies around I didn't
 
05:30:53.570 --> 05:30:53.580 align:start position:0%
count them but he I think he indicated
 
05:30:56.628 --> 05:30:56.638 align:start position:0%
there's seven uh like them like Coast
 
05:30:58.850 --> 05:30:58.860 align:start position:0%
around the state
 
05:31:01.550 --> 05:31:01.560 align:start position:0%
and this money gets divvied up between
 
05:31:04.730 --> 05:31:04.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:07.190 --> 05:31:07.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I I didn't get into the match I
 
05:31:15.670 --> 05:31:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:19.570 --> 05:31:19.580 align:start position:0%
if we're so inclined uh you would add
 
05:31:21.770 --> 05:31:21.780 align:start position:0%
correct there's a million in the budget
 
05:31:23.868 --> 05:31:23.878 align:start position:0%
already so you'd get I'm just using
 
05:31:26.208 --> 05:31:26.218 align:start position:0%
round numbers so I'm looking at the uh
 
05:31:29.270 --> 05:31:29.280 align:start position:0%
the class line uh 73 the non-federal
 
05:31:31.190 --> 05:31:31.200 align:start position:0%
grants for public transportation and
 
05:31:31.200 --> 05:31:32.030 align:start position:0%
grants for public transportation and
there's

05:31:32.030 --> 05:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
there's
 
05:31:35.570 --> 05:31:35.580 align:start position:0%
uh 500 000 a year budget in there which
 
05:31:37.070 --> 05:31:37.080 align:start position:0%
most of that if not all is probably
 
05:31:39.530 --> 05:31:39.540 align:start position:0%
related to this this specific request
 
05:31:41.090 --> 05:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
came forward from the Department of
 
05:31:43.850 --> 05:31:43.860 align:start position:0%
Transportation the 1.883
 
05:31:45.890 --> 05:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
for the remaining to do the full match
 
05:31:47.208 --> 05:31:47.218 align:start position:0%
so that's
 
05:31:48.770 --> 05:31:48.780 align:start position:0%
that plus what's already in the budget
 
05:31:49.670 --> 05:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
would bring it up to the amount
 
05:31:55.550 --> 05:31:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:57.948 --> 05:31:57.958 align:start position:0%
I think it's rounded to 2.75 in here
 
05:31:57.958 --> 05:32:00.530 align:start position:0%
I think it's rounded to 2.75 in here
correct

05:32:00.530 --> 05:32:00.540 align:start position:0%
correct
 
05:32:12.490 --> 05:32:12.500 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:15.470 --> 05:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
I I can't speak to every budget I know
 
05:32:16.910 --> 05:32:16.920 align:start position:0%
there has been budgets we have done this
 
05:32:19.190 --> 05:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
match before I don't know the way I look
 
05:32:20.690 --> 05:32:20.700 align:start position:0%
at it we can put it on the list and if
 
05:32:21.830 --> 05:32:21.840 align:start position:0%
we don't have enough money we can take
 
05:32:24.530 --> 05:32:24.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:27.288 --> 05:32:27.298 align:start position:0%
would you
 
05:32:29.330 --> 05:32:29.340 align:start position:0%
so put it on the list as in you're
 
05:32:32.330 --> 05:32:32.340 align:start position:0%
approving that ad at this point right
 
05:32:34.550 --> 05:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
just as long as we understand that we
 
05:32:36.650 --> 05:32:36.660 align:start position:0%
may need to revisit everything we do is
 
05:32:39.890 --> 05:32:39.900 align:start position:0%
tentative just yeah and I'll I'll update
 
05:32:41.390 --> 05:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
our tracking sheet that that's been made
 
05:32:43.490 --> 05:32:43.500 align:start position:0%
we'll carry it when Mike Kane does his
 
05:32:45.890 --> 05:32:45.900 align:start position:0%
updates for the committee as a whole and
 
05:32:48.050 --> 05:32:48.060 align:start position:0%
then if later on in the process you have
 
05:32:50.090 --> 05:32:50.100 align:start position:0%
to revisit anything it can be done just
 
05:32:51.830 --> 05:32:51.840 align:start position:0%
making sure at the end we may get
 
05:32:57.530 --> 05:32:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:01.788 --> 05:33:01.798 align:start position:0%
or get more right oh yeah that's gonna
 
05:33:01.798 --> 05:33:07.070 align:start position:0%
or get more right oh yeah that's gonna
happen

05:33:07.070 --> 05:33:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:09.650 --> 05:33:09.660 align:start position:0%
you're able to division two didn't cut
 
05:33:09.660 --> 05:33:18.310 align:start position:0%
you're able to division two didn't cut
anyone

05:33:18.310 --> 05:33:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:34.448 --> 05:33:34.458 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:37.310 --> 05:33:37.320 align:start position:0%
two fourth
 
05:33:38.810 --> 05:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
100 million
 
05:33:38.820 --> 05:33:39.948 align:start position:0%
100 million
then

05:33:39.948 --> 05:33:39.958 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:33:43.010 --> 05:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
a few years before it came from repaid
 
05:33:46.010 --> 05:33:46.020 align:start position:0%
Creations from Brooks tax cuts
 
05:33:49.910 --> 05:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
to take three one issue overseas
 
05:33:51.890 --> 05:33:51.900 align:start position:0%
so sooner we had to hold us project
 
05:33:54.230 --> 05:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
one-time project
 
05:33:56.510 --> 05:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
came to here soon forward threw it all
 
05:33:56.520 --> 05:33:58.128 align:start position:0%
came to here soon forward threw it all
out

05:33:58.128 --> 05:33:58.138 align:start position:0%
out
 
05:34:01.368 --> 05:34:01.378 align:start position:0%
said we'll grow government
 
05:34:03.708 --> 05:34:03.718 align:start position:0%
particular wrong answer when you hit one
 
05:34:03.718 --> 05:34:05.330 align:start position:0%
particular wrong answer when you hit one
time

05:34:05.330 --> 05:34:05.340 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:34:08.470 --> 05:34:08.480 align:start position:0%
so we found that 80 million of 0.2
 
05:34:11.930 --> 05:34:11.940 align:start position:0%
HHS equipments
 
05:34:17.208 --> 05:34:17.218 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:25.430 --> 05:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:28.368 --> 05:34:28.378 align:start position:0%
I probably like I've never seen four
 
05:34:28.378 --> 05:34:31.030 align:start position:0%
I probably like I've never seen four
distantly

05:34:31.030 --> 05:34:31.040 align:start position:0%
distantly
 
05:34:34.150 --> 05:34:34.160 align:start position:0%
right here I
 
05:34:42.530 --> 05:34:42.540 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:44.868 --> 05:34:44.878 align:start position:0%
make anything else
 
05:34:47.090 --> 05:34:47.100 align:start position:0%
I think this might be a good place to to
 
05:34:48.890 --> 05:34:48.900 align:start position:0%
stop for today I think we've gotten
 
05:34:50.570 --> 05:34:50.580 align:start position:0%
everything through this I think is
 
05:34:53.690 --> 05:34:53.700 align:start position:0%
pretty easy that we uh with our missing
 
05:34:53.700 --> 05:34:55.368 align:start position:0%
pretty easy that we uh with our missing
members

05:34:55.368 --> 05:34:55.378 align:start position:0%
members
 
05:34:57.110 --> 05:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
I would just say that we are running out
 
05:34:59.090 --> 05:34:59.100 align:start position:0%
of time as everyone knows
 
05:35:02.868 --> 05:35:02.878 align:start position:0%
um next week next week we have a work
 
05:35:05.690 --> 05:35:05.700 align:start position:0%
session on Monday at 10 o'clock doe will
 
05:35:06.650 --> 05:35:06.660 align:start position:0%
be here
 
05:35:07.970 --> 05:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
in the afternoon we have our public
 
05:35:10.490 --> 05:35:10.500 align:start position:0%
hearing at two o'clock in reps Hall
 
05:35:12.530 --> 05:35:12.540 align:start position:0%
Tuesday we have a full day scheduled
 
05:35:14.330 --> 05:35:14.340 align:start position:0%
here but I'm also hearing we have a
 
05:35:15.770 --> 05:35:15.780 align:start position:0%
weather event potentially so we'll see
 
05:35:17.750 --> 05:35:17.760 align:start position:0%
what happens with that oh and it's also
 
05:35:20.208 --> 05:35:20.218 align:start position:0%
town meeting day so I don't know who it
 
05:35:22.610 --> 05:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
will be in available for that
 
05:35:25.128 --> 05:35:25.138 align:start position:0%
uh Wednesday I think we've got
 
05:35:26.810 --> 05:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
essentially a full day with full
 
05:35:26.820 --> 05:35:27.830 align:start position:0%
essentially a full day with full
committee

05:35:27.830 --> 05:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee
 
05:35:29.570 --> 05:35:29.580 align:start position:0%
and then Thursday there's a session day
 
05:35:31.368 --> 05:35:31.378 align:start position:0%
which I think surprised us that there
 
05:35:33.470 --> 05:35:33.480 align:start position:0%
was a session day this week
 
05:35:36.170 --> 05:35:36.180 align:start position:0%
on the 16th well they are trying to you
 
05:35:37.610 --> 05:35:37.620 align:start position:0%
know hopefully not have three of them
 
05:35:40.610 --> 05:35:40.620 align:start position:0%
the next week so and we may get one on
 
05:35:46.070 --> 05:35:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:48.010 --> 05:35:48.020 align:start position:0%
I'm here
 
05:35:50.510 --> 05:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
I'm available
 
05:35:52.070 --> 05:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
no I have nothing scheduled for a
 
05:35:54.170 --> 05:35:54.180 align:start position:0%
Saturday at this point by middle of the
 
05:35:56.090 --> 05:35:56.100 align:start position:0%
week if I'll leave it up to the chair in
 
05:35:59.868 --> 05:35:59.878 align:start position:0%
the committee to decide that
 
05:36:01.730 --> 05:36:01.740 align:start position:0%
and then yes because the following week
 
05:36:03.590 --> 05:36:03.600 align:start position:0%
is where we're asked to hold three days
 
05:36:06.830 --> 05:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
for sessions potentially and so yeah I
 
05:36:08.750 --> 05:36:08.760 align:start position:0%
think is it down to two because we're
 
05:36:10.970 --> 05:36:10.980 align:start position:0%
gonna go next week so that following
 
05:36:12.770 --> 05:36:12.780 align:start position:0%
Tuesday should be open the following
 
05:36:15.350 --> 05:36:15.360 align:start position:0%
week one of the days maybe two but not
 
05:36:17.090 --> 05:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
three okay
 
05:36:19.910 --> 05:36:19.920 align:start position:0%
I think uh two of the days were said to
 
05:36:22.190 --> 05:36:22.200 align:start position:0%
be sessions the Wednesday and Thursday
 
05:36:24.530 --> 05:36:24.540 align:start position:0%
yes and they said Hold Tuesday but if
 
05:36:26.150 --> 05:36:26.160 align:start position:0%
that Tuesday it becomes available for us
 
05:36:27.470 --> 05:36:27.480 align:start position:0%
that'll be good that'll Monday and
 
05:36:29.390 --> 05:36:29.400 align:start position:0%
Tuesday of that week we'll have to work
 
05:36:32.090 --> 05:36:32.100 align:start position:0%
which will be fine but that Thursday is
 
05:36:34.190 --> 05:36:34.200 align:start position:0%
our deadline the 23rd we're fast
 
05:36:35.990 --> 05:36:36.000 align:start position:0%
approaching so
 
05:36:37.850 --> 05:36:37.860 align:start position:0%
I would say if anyone has any amendments
 
05:36:39.890 --> 05:36:39.900 align:start position:0%
that you would like drafted anything you
 
05:36:41.750 --> 05:36:41.760 align:start position:0%
want to try to run anything you want to
 
05:36:43.970 --> 05:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
work through with me to be prepared for
 
05:36:47.270 --> 05:36:47.280 align:start position:0%
next week or whenever don't hesitate to
 
05:36:49.070 --> 05:36:49.080 align:start position:0%
reach out
 
05:36:51.050 --> 05:36:51.060 align:start position:0%
but I'll update these documents based on
 
05:36:52.910 --> 05:36:52.920 align:start position:0%
our decisions today
 
05:36:54.350 --> 05:36:54.360 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
05:36:55.910 --> 05:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have a fresh starting point for
 
05:36:59.090 --> 05:36:59.100 align:start position:0%
Monday when we have Doe okay well with
 
05:37:02.510 --> 05:37:02.520 align:start position:0%
with Theo once we get through Doe
 
05:37:02.520 --> 05:37:03.470 align:start position:0%
with Theo once we get through Doe
um

05:37:03.470 --> 05:37:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:37:07.250 --> 05:37:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:09.770 --> 05:37:09.780 align:start position:0%
it's a variety look at the top of the
 
05:37:09.780 --> 05:37:11.270 align:start position:0%
it's a variety look at the top of the
sheet

05:37:11.270 --> 05:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
sheet
 
05:37:11.280 --> 05:37:12.410 align:start position:0%
sheet
yeah

05:37:12.410 --> 05:37:12.420 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:37:14.448 --> 05:37:14.458 align:start position:0%
and that that doesn't seem to be one
 
05:37:18.288 --> 05:37:18.298 align:start position:0%
Department I see UNH oh yes yeah ccs and
 
05:37:19.788 --> 05:37:19.798 align:start position:0%
H you have that one retirement set
 
05:37:23.510 --> 05:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
system section then the UNH items and
 
05:37:26.150 --> 05:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
then basically the rest is doe with the
 
05:37:29.270 --> 05:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
exception of that one it rights of way
 
05:37:31.550 --> 05:37:31.560 align:start position:0%
relative to the prime Wetlands that we
 
05:37:34.128 --> 05:37:34.138 align:start position:0%
held but everything else is doe related
 
05:37:36.948 --> 05:37:36.958 align:start position:0%
so I'm hoping uh just to be able to walk
 
05:37:38.330 --> 05:37:38.340 align:start position:0%
through each of those sections with the
 
05:37:40.550 --> 05:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
Department Monday so and the second page
 
05:37:42.410 --> 05:37:42.420 align:start position:0%
is also all doe yeah the only thing
 
05:37:45.470 --> 05:37:45.480 align:start position:0%
that's not doe specific is uh the last
 
05:37:47.150 --> 05:37:47.160 align:start position:0%
two sections relative to the education
 
05:37:49.190 --> 05:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
trust fund distribution of uh business
 
05:37:51.948 --> 05:37:51.958 align:start position:0%
Revenue business tax revenue so I think
 
05:37:53.270 --> 05:37:53.280 align:start position:0%
that's up in the air what this committee
 
05:37:55.070 --> 05:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
is going to do with the education trust
 
05:37:57.170 --> 05:37:57.180 align:start position:0%
fund as a whole so
 
05:37:59.448 --> 05:37:59.458 align:start position:0%
well it really depends on other other
 
05:37:59.458 --> 05:38:03.350 align:start position:0%
well it really depends on other other
items

05:38:03.350 --> 05:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:06.830 --> 05:38:06.840 align:start position:0%
best deal yes all those sections are doe
 
05:38:19.070 --> 05:38:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:23.090 --> 05:38:23.100 align:start position:0%
and there is an updated on let's say
 
05:38:25.310 --> 05:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
I don't know page six perhaps I'll put
 
05:38:26.628 --> 05:38:26.638 align:start position:0%
page numbers on this to make it easier
 
05:38:28.910 --> 05:38:28.920 align:start position:0%
for next week the education trust fund
 
05:38:31.250 --> 05:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
snapshot with all of your changes coming
 
05:38:32.390 --> 05:38:32.400 align:start position:0%
into today
 
05:38:34.788 --> 05:38:34.798 align:start position:0%
so you can see you know the removal of
 
05:38:37.010 --> 05:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
the 75 million dollars for the
 
05:38:39.708 --> 05:38:39.718 align:start position:0%
School building Aid fund you also
 
05:38:41.448 --> 05:38:41.458 align:start position:0%
increase tuition and transportation by
 
05:38:43.910 --> 05:38:43.920 align:start position:0%
2.2 million a year and then we're also
 
05:38:46.670 --> 05:38:46.680 align:start position:0%
going to carry that snap expansion of
 
05:38:49.250 --> 05:38:49.260 align:start position:0%
the fnr population adjustment you'll see
 
05:38:51.708 --> 05:38:51.718 align:start position:0%
that on line 38 30 million over the
 
05:38:53.570 --> 05:38:53.580 align:start position:0%
biennium so after all those changes
 
05:38:56.690 --> 05:38:56.700 align:start position:0%
there's still 104 million dollars in the
 
05:38:58.550 --> 05:38:58.560 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is your current
 
05:38:58.560 --> 05:38:59.930 align:start position:0%
education trust fund is your current
position

05:38:59.930 --> 05:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
position
 
05:39:04.128 --> 05:39:04.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:09.050 --> 05:39:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:12.288 --> 05:39:12.298 align:start position:0%
as I look on the second page that 75
 
05:39:15.310 --> 05:39:15.320 align:start position:0%
million dollars is line
 
05:39:19.550 --> 05:39:19.560 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:21.890 --> 05:39:21.900 align:start position:0%
ah correct yeah from house bill 2. so
 
05:39:23.930 --> 05:39:23.940 align:start position:0%
that that'll be
 
05:39:25.610 --> 05:39:25.620 align:start position:0%
yep we'll draft an amendment that'll
 
05:39:28.070 --> 05:39:28.080 align:start position:0%
delete that essentially okay so once
 
05:39:30.350 --> 05:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
once that's uh drafted I think it just
 
05:39:32.150 --> 05:39:32.160 align:start position:0%
wasn't prepared for today's packet
 
05:39:33.830 --> 05:39:33.840 align:start position:0%
that's all right I'll have that in there
 
05:39:35.208 --> 05:39:35.218 align:start position:0%
yep I'm just
 
05:39:39.110 --> 05:39:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:39:41.990 --> 05:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
my point being that once we have doe in
 
05:39:45.050 --> 05:39:45.060 align:start position:0%
we'll pretty much knock out hv2
 
05:39:45.060 --> 05:39:46.490 align:start position:0%
we'll pretty much knock out hv2
you'll

05:39:46.490 --> 05:39:46.500 align:start position:0%
you'll
 
05:39:48.470 --> 05:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
be with a couple of big decisions to
 
05:39:50.030 --> 05:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
make I think school building Aid is
 
05:39:51.708 --> 05:39:51.718 align:start position:0%
still in question as well as just your
 
05:39:53.510 --> 05:39:53.520 align:start position:0%
education funding proposal what you want
 
05:39:54.590 --> 05:39:54.600 align:start position:0%
to do with that compared to the
 
05:39:55.970 --> 05:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
governors you have a couple of bills
 
05:39:58.490 --> 05:39:58.500 align:start position:0%
that changed education funding so I
 
05:40:00.470 --> 05:40:00.480 align:start position:0%
think all that is many of these House
 
05:40:02.510 --> 05:40:02.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 sections but at least after you
 
05:40:04.368 --> 05:40:04.378 align:start position:0%
have doe in you'll have heard from all
 
05:40:06.050 --> 05:40:06.060 align:start position:0%
the agency folks and we've gone through
 
05:40:07.610 --> 05:40:07.620 align:start position:0%
every section so we should be familiar
 
05:40:09.530 --> 05:40:09.540 align:start position:0%
with the content and then it's just up
 
05:40:12.830 --> 05:40:12.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:14.448 --> 05:40:14.458 align:start position:0%
they said there was a conflict with some
 
05:40:16.850 --> 05:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
of the bills that were passed can we get
 
05:40:18.890 --> 05:40:18.900 align:start position:0%
an explanation or you know a little
 
05:40:20.930 --> 05:40:20.940 align:start position:0%
chart to explain the the conflicts and
 
05:40:22.690 --> 05:40:22.700 align:start position:0%
what we need to do to fix that
 
05:40:25.788 --> 05:40:25.798 align:start position:0%
uh are you talking about from yesterday
 
05:40:28.310 --> 05:40:28.320 align:start position:0%
so yeah uh
 
05:40:30.590 --> 05:40:30.600 align:start position:0%
a couple of the esa related bills that
 
05:40:33.170 --> 05:40:33.180 align:start position:0%
passed yesterday relative to eligibility
 
05:40:36.830 --> 05:40:36.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:41.410 --> 05:40:41.420 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:45.830 --> 05:40:45.840 align:start position:0%
367 increase the income threshold from
 
05:40:49.330 --> 05:40:49.340 align:start position:0%
300 percent of federal poverty to 350.
 
05:40:54.350 --> 05:40:54.360 align:start position:0%
then House Bill 464 passed which added
 
05:40:55.910 --> 05:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
all those expanded criteria of
 
05:40:57.470 --> 05:40:57.480 align:start position:0%
Eligibility that we also see in House
 
05:41:01.670 --> 05:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 but also re also included the
 
05:41:03.410 --> 05:41:03.420 align:start position:0%
section of the income eligibility for
 
05:41:06.110 --> 05:41:06.120 align:start position:0%
all students at 300 percent so
 
05:41:07.970 --> 05:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
you had two bills passed yesterday one
 
05:41:10.128 --> 05:41:10.138 align:start position:0%
with three hundred percent one with 350
 
05:41:12.288 --> 05:41:12.298 align:start position:0%
percent of federal poverty you have that
 
05:41:14.628 --> 05:41:14.638 align:start position:0%
section of law in-house Bill too so this
 
05:41:17.090 --> 05:41:17.100 align:start position:0%
committee can decide what you want to do
 
05:41:21.350 --> 05:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
with an amendment to align it with the
 
05:41:22.850 --> 05:41:22.860 align:start position:0%
house policy that passed those bills
 
05:41:24.230 --> 05:41:24.240 align:start position:0%
didn't get referred to us so those are
 
05:41:26.150 --> 05:41:26.160 align:start position:0%
going to cross over to the Senate so
 
05:41:27.410 --> 05:41:27.420 align:start position:0%
this committee can decide what you want
 
05:41:30.110 --> 05:41:30.120 align:start position:0%
to do as far as aligning with the bills
 
05:41:31.850 --> 05:41:31.860 align:start position:0%
that pass what bills will not be
 
05:41:33.430 --> 05:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
referred to us
 
05:41:38.208 --> 05:41:38.218 align:start position:0%
464 367 and 440. will not be referred to
 
05:41:41.090 --> 05:41:41.100 align:start position:0%
us why
 
05:41:43.550 --> 05:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
don't know but they do have a physical
 
05:41:46.368 --> 05:41:46.378 align:start position:0%
impact never mind I get that they would
 
05:41:48.830 --> 05:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
but and we can address it with I know
 
05:41:50.150 --> 05:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
I'm just trying to understand the
 
05:41:52.150 --> 05:41:52.160 align:start position:0%
mechanics I'm new again yeah
 
05:41:56.030 --> 05:41:56.040 align:start position:0%
and then the 440 is a bill that is
 
05:41:58.128 --> 05:41:58.138 align:start position:0%
similar to what is in the governor's
 
05:42:00.110 --> 05:42:00.120 align:start position:0%
house bill to relative to all the uses
 
05:42:03.230 --> 05:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
of the education trust fund including uh
 
05:42:05.208 --> 05:42:05.218 align:start position:0%
provision allowing the Department of
 
05:42:07.128 --> 05:42:07.138 align:start position:0%
Education to retain up to a certain
 
05:42:08.750 --> 05:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
amount of the education trust fund for
 
05:42:10.788 --> 05:42:10.798 align:start position:0%
administration so we haven't got to
 
05:42:12.530 --> 05:42:12.540 align:start position:0%
those sections yet of House Bill too
 
05:42:13.970 --> 05:42:13.980 align:start position:0%
they're they're hopefully we can cover
 
05:42:16.250 --> 05:42:16.260 align:start position:0%
those with the department but those
 
05:42:19.070 --> 05:42:19.080 align:start position:0%
pieces of legislation did pass so it'll
 
05:42:20.390 --> 05:42:20.400 align:start position:0%
be up to this committee whether you want
 
05:42:23.390 --> 05:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
to just mirror essentially what pass or
 
05:42:24.890 --> 05:42:24.900 align:start position:0%
if you want to do anything different
 
05:42:26.390 --> 05:42:26.400 align:start position:0%
than essentially the house would have
 
05:42:36.910 --> 05:42:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:39.250 --> 05:42:39.260 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:42:42.050 --> 05:42:42.060 align:start position:0%
in the House Bill 2 there is
 
05:42:45.110 --> 05:42:45.120 align:start position:0%
in 464 that passed yesterday there was
 
05:42:45.120 --> 05:42:46.910 align:start position:0%
in 464 that passed yesterday there was
not

05:42:46.910 --> 05:42:46.920 align:start position:0%
not
 
05:42:49.128 --> 05:42:49.138 align:start position:0%
so that's one of the just differences
 
05:42:50.810 --> 05:42:50.820 align:start position:0%
between what the bill is before you
 
05:42:52.550 --> 05:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 versus what is already past
 
05:42:55.610 --> 05:42:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:57.110 --> 05:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
um what's that cost the difference
 
05:42:59.810 --> 05:42:59.820 align:start position:0%
between uh 350 and 500 I don't know
 
05:43:02.330 --> 05:43:02.340 align:start position:0%
we're not getting I don't know estimates
 
05:43:18.430 --> 05:43:18.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:21.770 --> 05:43:21.780 align:start position:0%
no it's no 500. the education Freedom
 
05:43:23.510 --> 05:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
account program has a provision similar
 
05:43:25.490 --> 05:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
to adequacy that however much is needed
 
05:43:27.170 --> 05:43:27.180 align:start position:0%
for it the department should draw a
 
05:43:28.610 --> 05:43:28.620 align:start position:0%
warrant from the education trust fund to
 
05:43:33.730 --> 05:43:33.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:35.628 --> 05:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
this time there's actually an amount
 
05:43:37.610 --> 05:43:37.620 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill too that's only 29 million
 
05:43:39.288 --> 05:43:39.298 align:start position:0%
dollars a year so we don't have any
 
05:43:40.970 --> 05:43:40.980 align:start position:0%
other numbers to go on you can ask the
 
05:43:42.350 --> 05:43:42.360 align:start position:0%
department about it Monday if they have
 
05:43:46.128 --> 05:43:46.138 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:49.788 --> 05:43:49.798 align:start position:0%
300 and one bill about 350. we'll make
 
05:43:54.190 --> 05:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:04.850 --> 05:44:04.860 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:07.910 --> 05:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
well I was 350. almost that's what I'm
 
05:44:12.288 --> 05:44:12.298 align:start position:0%
saying okay but but hb2 already has 500
 
05:44:16.810 --> 05:44:16.820 align:start position:0%
so so hp2 and the last bill
 
05:44:19.610 --> 05:44:19.620 align:start position:0%
they won't we're done well that's that's
 
05:44:22.128 --> 05:44:22.138 align:start position:0%
the idea yeah but I you know I just want
 
05:44:24.250 --> 05:44:24.260 align:start position:0%
to understand
 
05:44:26.868 --> 05:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
which one are you going to pick I mean
 
05:44:29.330 --> 05:44:29.340 align:start position:0%
we can pick it's not even coming to us
 
05:44:31.090 --> 05:44:31.100 align:start position:0%
but we can change it
 
05:44:39.010 --> 05:44:39.020 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:48.970 --> 05:44:48.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:58.670 --> 05:44:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:02.150 --> 05:45:02.160 align:start position:0%
I agree I would too
 
05:45:07.990 --> 05:45:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:10.510 --> 05:45:10.520 align:start position:0%
so this is this is a Monday conversation
 
05:45:12.708 --> 05:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
uh the one percent
 
05:45:15.770 --> 05:45:15.780 align:start position:0%
I mean I can point you to where it is in
 
05:45:18.590 --> 05:45:18.600 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 and you can read but I I
 
05:45:20.230 --> 05:45:20.240 align:start position:0%
can't answer
 
05:45:22.250 --> 05:45:22.260 align:start position:0%
when they're here when they're here I
 
05:45:23.690 --> 05:45:23.700 align:start position:0%
would certainly ask them why that's
 
05:45:26.090 --> 05:45:26.100 align:start position:0%
in-house Bill 2 and how they intend the
 
05:45:27.470 --> 05:45:27.480 align:start position:0%
application of that statute would work
 
05:45:28.850 --> 05:45:28.860 align:start position:0%
the way it's written is there another
 
05:45:30.830 --> 05:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
unusual I would I would say is there any
 
05:45:33.048 --> 05:45:33.058 align:start position:0%
other agency that has that kind of a
 
05:45:33.058 --> 05:45:33.948 align:start position:0%
other agency that has that kind of a
provision

05:45:33.948 --> 05:45:33.958 align:start position:0%
provision
 
05:45:41.810 --> 05:45:41.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:45.288 --> 05:45:45.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:45:47.030 --> 05:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
yeah we don't we're not providing grants
 
05:45:49.070 --> 05:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
to them we're funding their work so it's
 
05:45:49.080 --> 05:45:51.310 align:start position:0%
to them we're funding their work so it's
yeah

05:45:51.310 --> 05:45:51.320 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:45:54.708 --> 05:45:54.718 align:start position:0%
generally when there's a uh provision
 
05:45:56.628 --> 05:45:56.638 align:start position:0%
for an agency to take money to
 
05:45:58.368 --> 05:45:58.378 align:start position:0%
administer a program it's usually not
 
05:46:00.890 --> 05:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
State funds with this being State funds
 
05:46:03.048 --> 05:46:03.058 align:start position:0%
I think it's pretty unusual that because
 
05:46:05.090 --> 05:46:05.100 align:start position:0%
doe is funded with State funds and then
 
05:46:07.430 --> 05:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
to take a piece of estate fund to
 
05:46:09.350 --> 05:46:09.360 align:start position:0%
administer that state fund there's I
 
05:46:10.490 --> 05:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
don't think it sounds like you've only
 
05:46:16.930 --> 05:46:16.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:46:21.470 --> 05:46:21.480 align:start position:0%
I think what there is an administrative
 
05:46:21.480 --> 05:46:22.850 align:start position:0%
I think what there is an administrative
account

05:46:22.850 --> 05:46:22.860 align:start position:0%
account
 
05:46:24.770 --> 05:46:24.780 align:start position:0%
let me back up there is a new accounting
 
05:46:25.970 --> 05:46:25.980 align:start position:0%
unit in the budget for ETF
 
05:46:28.128 --> 05:46:28.138 align:start position:0%
Administration which started last budget
 
05:46:30.110 --> 05:46:30.120 align:start position:0%
which is mostly I.T related I believe
 
05:46:32.830 --> 05:46:32.840 align:start position:0%
Data Systems
 
05:46:35.628 --> 05:46:35.638 align:start position:0%
so one thing that that section could be
 
05:46:39.230 --> 05:46:39.240 align:start position:0%
modified to do is just say that the
 
05:46:41.810 --> 05:46:41.820 align:start position:0%
education trust fund may be used for
 
05:46:43.730 --> 05:46:43.740 align:start position:0%
administrative costs of the Department
 
05:46:45.590 --> 05:46:45.600 align:start position:0%
of Education as determined by the
 
05:46:47.690 --> 05:46:47.700 align:start position:0%
general court so rather than a one
 
05:46:49.368 --> 05:46:49.378 align:start position:0%
percent just kind of an up to whatever
 
05:46:50.990 --> 05:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
amount it's just really whatever you put
 
05:46:53.390 --> 05:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
in the budget is all they can spend and
 
05:46:54.830 --> 05:46:54.840 align:start position:0%
I think maybe that could have been what
 
05:46:57.170 --> 05:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
they were going for and they just used a
 
05:46:59.270 --> 05:46:59.280 align:start position:0%
language that kind of aligns with other
 
05:47:01.190 --> 05:47:01.200 align:start position:0%
types of Grants or federal programs but
 
05:47:02.750 --> 05:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
I think working through it with that
 
05:47:04.610 --> 05:47:04.620 align:start position:0%
Monday is the way to go
 
05:47:08.810 --> 05:47:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:10.910 --> 05:47:10.920 align:start position:0%
and it's unclear who determines the up
 
05:47:10.920 --> 05:47:11.990 align:start position:0%
and it's unclear who determines the up
to

05:47:11.990 --> 05:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
to
 
05:47:14.090 --> 05:47:14.100 align:start position:0%
so I mean one percent one percent of a
 
05:47:19.730 --> 05:47:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:19.740 --> 05:47:21.170 align:start position:0%
 
never

05:47:21.170 --> 05:47:21.180 align:start position:0%
never
 
05:47:21.180 --> 05:47:23.570 align:start position:0%
never
never

05:47:23.570 --> 05:47:23.580 align:start position:0%
never
 
05:47:26.090 --> 05:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
we could administer the efas in-house
 
05:47:28.070 --> 05:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
for that
 
05:47:28.080 --> 05:47:32.090 align:start position:0%
for that
sorry

05:47:32.090 --> 05:47:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:34.548 --> 05:47:34.558 align:start position:0%
yeah I wish we could keep that 10 in New
 
05:47:34.558 --> 05:47:41.890 align:start position:0%
yeah I wish we could keep that 10 in New
Hampshire

05:47:41.890 --> 05:47:41.900 align:start position:0%
 
05:47:45.350 --> 05:47:45.360 align:start position:0%
just so you'll know the uh there there's
 
05:47:47.810 --> 05:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
an accountability for administration
 
05:47:51.830 --> 05:47:51.840 align:start position:0%
and funds in excess of of that 10
 
05:47:53.868 --> 05:47:53.878 align:start position:0%
percent flowing
 
05:47:56.270 --> 05:47:56.280 align:start position:0%
flow to the students
 
05:47:59.030 --> 05:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not a profit line for the
 
05:47:59.040 --> 05:48:00.410 align:start position:0%
it's not it's not a profit line for the
administrators

05:48:00.410 --> 05:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
administrators
 
05:48:02.628 --> 05:48:02.638 align:start position:0%
we're making it sound like 100 million
 
05:48:04.010 --> 05:48:04.020 align:start position:0%
dollars they're keeping 10 million
 
05:48:05.868 --> 05:48:05.878 align:start position:0%
dollars that's not the case
 
05:48:07.490 --> 05:48:07.500 align:start position:0%
10 million dollars is a sign for
 
05:48:09.530 --> 05:48:09.540 align:start position:0%
administration what they don't consume
 
05:48:13.190 --> 05:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
and justify flows out to the students
 
05:48:18.288 --> 05:48:18.298 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:20.628 --> 05:48:20.638 align:start position:0%
the lowest organization
 
05:48:23.390 --> 05:48:23.400 align:start position:0%
is allowed to take 10 percent
 
05:48:28.788 --> 05:48:28.798 align:start position:0%
of each and people of each education
 
05:48:28.798 --> 05:48:32.628 align:start position:0%
of each and people of each education
account

05:48:32.628 --> 05:48:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:35.030 --> 05:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
um so you're saying they don't I'm
 
05:48:36.590 --> 05:48:36.600 align:start position:0%
saying they don't
 
05:48:40.010 --> 05:48:40.020 align:start position:0%
I I think they did but they don't
 
05:48:43.010 --> 05:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
according to according to them
 
05:48:43.020 --> 05:48:44.990 align:start position:0%
according to according to them
okay

05:48:44.990 --> 05:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
okay
 
05:48:48.350 --> 05:48:48.360 align:start position:0%
that's that was represented by the
 
05:48:53.930 --> 05:48:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:56.628 --> 05:48:56.638 align:start position:0%
but but she said
 
05:48:59.810 --> 05:48:59.820 align:start position:0%
what they don't use in administration is
 
05:49:01.310 --> 05:49:01.320 align:start position:0%
an additional funding that goes out to
 
05:49:01.320 --> 05:49:01.970 align:start position:0%
an additional funding that goes out to
this

05:49:01.970 --> 05:49:01.980 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:49:01.980 --> 05:49:08.990 align:start position:0%
this
okay

05:49:08.990 --> 05:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:12.410 --> 05:49:12.420 align:start position:0%
the point is well she's got 10 employees
 
05:49:14.208 --> 05:49:14.218 align:start position:0%
and and you're not going to do it with
 
05:49:26.830 --> 05:49:26.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:49:29.470 --> 05:49:29.480 align:start position:0%
so much
 
05:49:31.390 --> 05:49:31.400 align:start position:0%
across the country
 
05:50:06.230 --> 05:50:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:06.240 --> 05:50:09.240 align:start position:0%
 
foreign
