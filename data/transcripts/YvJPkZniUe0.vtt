00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 align:start position:0%
morning everybody being 10 o'clock I'm
 
00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 align:start position:0%
going to call us to order and open the
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%
public hearing on HB
 
00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 align:start position:0%
1387 relative to revisions of the State
 
00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
Building Code and welcome representative
 
00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 align:start position:0%
present good morning I'm Carol Maguire
 
00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 align:start position:0%
representing maror 27 which is
 
00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:00.759 align:start position:0%
the district for Allenstown Barton epan
 
00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 align:start position:0%
hooks it and House Bill
 
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:09.440 align:start position:0%
1357 1387 excuse me is technical
 
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 align:start position:0%
revisions to the process of making
 
00:06:14.189 --> 00:06:14.199 align:start position:0%
revisions to the building code board it
 
00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:18.280 align:start position:0%
is a procedural bill it doesn't actually
 
00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:21.639 align:start position:0%
update the code and it was a request to
 
00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:24.520 align:start position:0%
the building code review board and if
 
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
you I the chair of the building code
 
00:06:30.510 --> 00:06:30.520 align:start position:0%
review board is here to to uh explain
 
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:32.360 align:start position:0%
the details if you have any questions
 
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
ones thank you very much are there any
 
00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
gr thank you um representative Maguire
 
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
this is a bill that we we review every
 
00:06:50.150 --> 00:06:50.160 align:start position:0%
year or every other year to make sure
 
00:06:51.909 --> 00:06:51.919 align:start position:0%
that our building codes are updated is
 
00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 align:start position:0%
that correct no that is not correct okay
 
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:56.240 align:start position:0%
can that is the next bill coming up oh
 
00:06:59.790 --> 00:06:59.800 align:start position:0%
okay sorry this one is a as I said it
 
00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 align:start position:0%
some minor tweaks to the structure of
 
00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
the building code review board and other
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
updates to the process not not to the
 
00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank
 
00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
you uh Philip Sherman building code
 
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.309 align:start position:0%
you uh Philip Sherman building code
review

00:07:28.309 --> 00:07:28.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:37.390 align:start position:0%
 
board

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:38.960 align:start position:0%
good morning Mr chair members of the
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
committee uh thank you for the
 
00:07:43.869 --> 00:07:43.879 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak uh my I'm Philip
 
00:07:45.350 --> 00:07:45.360 align:start position:0%
Philip Sherman chair of the building
 
00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:47.240 align:start position:0%
code review board I speak in favor of
 
00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:50.720 align:start position:0%
this bill obviously um this bill is
 
00:07:53.149 --> 00:07:53.159 align:start position:0%
primarily uh what I'll call housekeeping
 
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:56.240 align:start position:0%
the term of art clearly of RSA
 
00:07:58.790 --> 00:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
155a and just picking up some things
 
00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
that uh we think can can clean things up
 
00:08:05.029 --> 00:08:05.039 align:start position:0%
a little bit um I'm prepared to walk
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
through each of these disjointed Parts
 
00:08:09.749 --> 00:08:09.759 align:start position:0%
uh in order and then answer questions or
 
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:11.440 align:start position:0%
if you'd prefer and want to interrupt me
 
00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:13.759 align:start position:0%
as we go along because they do sort of
 
00:08:16.469 --> 00:08:16.479 align:start position:0%
Stand Alone um um you know if you want
 
00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:18.120 align:start position:0%
to take a brief pause at certain points
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
to see if there are questions that would
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
probably be helpful and if not we can
 
00:08:22.749 --> 00:08:22.759 align:start position:0%
just keep moving on okay so I'll just
 
00:08:24.670 --> 00:08:24.680 align:start position:0%
just run through the points uh generally
 
00:08:27.469 --> 00:08:27.479 align:start position:0%
in order that they are in the bill so uh
 
00:08:29.629 --> 00:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
currently there is an accessibil
 
00:08:31.909 --> 00:08:31.919 align:start position:0%
certification that's required to be
 
00:08:35.469 --> 00:08:35.479 align:start position:0%
submitted uh to the owner and this bill
 
00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:38.120 align:start position:0%
also requires that certification which
 
00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:40.120 align:start position:0%
is already required to be done to be
 
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:42.440 align:start position:0%
submitted to the building inspector at
 
00:08:44.070 --> 00:08:44.080 align:start position:0%
this time the building inspector is sort
 
00:08:45.829 --> 00:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
of left chasing the owner around trying
 
00:08:48.310 --> 00:08:48.320 align:start position:0%
to get a copy of the certification to
 
00:08:50.710 --> 00:08:50.720 align:start position:0%
see if it was ever done or not uh so
 
00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
that's simply an administrative thing uh
 
00:08:55.990 --> 00:08:56.000 align:start position:0%
the bill proposes reassigning one member
 
00:08:57.710 --> 00:08:57.720 align:start position:0%
of the of the board of building code
 
00:09:00.110 --> 00:09:00.120 align:start position:0%
review board from a mechanical engineer
 
00:09:02.630 --> 00:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
to a mechanical or a fire protection
 
00:09:05.030 --> 00:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
engineer uh fire protection Engineers
 
00:09:07.230 --> 00:09:07.240 align:start position:0%
frequently have very broad background in
 
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
the various codes uh the board of Fire
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
Control includes an FP now uh and we
 
00:09:14.430 --> 00:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
think that that's an appropriate mix for
 
00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:16.480 align:start position:0%
our board without adding another member
 
00:09:19.670 --> 00:09:19.680 align:start position:0%
to the board um the bill places a
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
three-year term on Alternate members of
 
00:09:23.790 --> 00:09:23.800 align:start position:0%
the board without a limit on the number
 
00:09:27.150 --> 00:09:27.160 align:start position:0%
of terms so primary members of the board
 
00:09:30.269 --> 00:09:30.279 align:start position:0%
have a limit of three three-year terms
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
nine years total alternates uh do not
 
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:36.760 align:start position:0%
frequently they move on to board primary
 
00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
positions the reason for this is we've
 
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:41.680 align:start position:0%
had alternates sort of drift away and I
 
00:09:44.069 --> 00:09:44.079 align:start position:0%
believe we may have had one drift off
 
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
the face of this Earth uh and nobody
 
00:09:49.069 --> 00:09:49.079 align:start position:0%
knows so this just gives us a check to
 
00:09:50.670 --> 00:09:50.680 align:start position:0%
say are you still there are you
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
interested are you participating and
 
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:55.600 align:start position:0%
then somebody just reappoints them uh
 
00:09:58.590 --> 00:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's kind of no mus no fuss uh the
 
00:10:01.389 --> 00:10:01.399 align:start position:0%
bill clarifies the method used to assess
 
00:10:04.350 --> 00:10:04.360 align:start position:0%
the cost impact of proposed updated
 
00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:06.880 align:start position:0%
codes and brings it into alignment with
 
00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
the method used since this requirement
 
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
was in place so currently the RSA
 
00:10:13.990 --> 00:10:14.000 align:start position:0%
requires us to do cost estimates we have
 
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
no ability to do that and in fact States
 
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:19.000 align:start position:0%
uh that spend a lot of money on this
 
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:21.160 align:start position:0%
really are not doing cost estimates they
 
00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
may take a sample case or something like
 
00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:26.760 align:start position:0%
that uh what what my understanding has
 
00:10:30.269 --> 00:10:30.279 align:start position:0%
been done for 20-some years now is the
 
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:32.880 align:start position:0%
relative cost impact is assessed does it
 
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:34.920 align:start position:0%
cost more money does it cost less money
 
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:37.440 align:start position:0%
or is there no impact at all which is
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
really all we have the capability of
 
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:41.760 align:start position:0%
doing and that's what the reports going
 
00:10:44.350 --> 00:10:44.360 align:start position:0%
back sometime have have reflected so
 
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:46.440 align:start position:0%
this just talks about the relative cost
 
00:10:51.069 --> 00:10:51.079 align:start position:0%
impact rather than a firm estimate of
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
cost um the bill proposes to eliminate
 
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.120 align:start position:0%
the need for a model code to be
 
00:10:59.030 --> 00:10:59.040 align:start position:0%
published for two years before sub
 
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:01.000 align:start position:0%
submitting for ra
 
00:11:03.269 --> 00:11:03.279 align:start position:0%
ratification um this is done for the
 
00:11:03.279 --> 00:11:04.389 align:start position:0%
ratification um this is done for the
following

00:11:04.389 --> 00:11:04.399 align:start position:0%
following
 
00:11:07.150 --> 00:11:07.160 align:start position:0%
reasons we think it may take some of the
 
00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:11.240 align:start position:0%
pressure off of some Municipal some
 
00:11:12.990 --> 00:11:13.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities who want to get to a
 
00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
later addition of the model code quicker
 
00:11:18.350 --> 00:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
so there's a a bit of a tussle where
 
00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:20.120 align:start position:0%
some municipalities want to take the
 
00:11:21.430 --> 00:11:21.440 align:start position:0%
codes that are in the New Hampshire
 
00:11:23.949 --> 00:11:23.959 align:start position:0%
State Building Code and adopt a later
 
00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
addition of the model code and this may
 
00:11:30.269 --> 00:11:30.279 align:start position:0%
take some of the pressure off of that
 
00:11:32.470 --> 00:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
secondly in this day and age the entire
 
00:11:35.069 --> 00:11:35.079 align:start position:0%
model code process is very open to any
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
interested party on the web you can see
 
00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
everything that's different than it was
 
00:11:42.150 --> 00:11:42.160 align:start position:0%
several years ago trade groups are very
 
00:11:44.509 --> 00:11:44.519 align:start position:0%
active in the code adoption process
 
00:11:46.389 --> 00:11:46.399 align:start position:0%
generally any large areas of
 
00:11:48.269 --> 00:11:48.279 align:start position:0%
disagreement are well known before the
 
00:11:50.470 --> 00:11:50.480 align:start position:0%
code is ever published therefore the
 
00:11:53.949 --> 00:11:53.959 align:start position:0%
need to wait is is reduced the ability
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
to rely on other states who publish
 
00:11:58.629 --> 00:11:58.639 align:start position:0%
analyses is maintained is they also have
 
00:12:00.269 --> 00:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
a you know somewhat similar code
 
00:12:02.750 --> 00:12:02.760 align:start position:0%
adoption process and that aligns with
 
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360 align:start position:0%
the publication of their analyses anyway
 
00:12:07.430 --> 00:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
so their own people need that analyses
 
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:10.760 align:start position:0%
before we do and and if we track a Rhode
 
00:12:13.189 --> 00:12:13.199 align:start position:0%
Island or a Florida who are the two who
 
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:15.440 align:start position:0%
write the reports we we sometimes look
 
00:12:18.069 --> 00:12:18.079 align:start position:0%
to uh they're sort of on the same cycle
 
00:12:20.150 --> 00:12:20.160 align:start position:0%
we are and that that work is still
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
available publicly uh and the federal
 
00:12:25.509 --> 00:12:25.519 align:start position:0%
government frequently is ahead of that
 
00:12:27.710 --> 00:12:27.720 align:start position:0%
when they do the areas that they're
 
00:12:30.509 --> 00:12:30.519 align:start position:0%
interested in analyzing
 
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
this being said we think that the
 
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
electrical code consisting of many more
 
00:12:37.030 --> 00:12:37.040 align:start position:0%
detailed requirements than most other
 
00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
codes is is a somewhat special case and
 
00:12:41.710 --> 00:12:41.720 align:start position:0%
talking with an active member of their
 
00:12:44.030 --> 00:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
code process who who's a supporter of
 
00:12:46.629 --> 00:12:46.639 align:start position:0%
our process it seems that reducing this
 
00:12:49.990 --> 00:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
two years to one year might make more
 
00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:52.360 align:start position:0%
sense and given the publication cycle of
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
the electrical code that would give them
 
00:12:58.470 --> 00:12:58.480 align:start position:0%
the ability to see it for a year before
 
00:13:02.189 --> 00:13:02.199 align:start position:0%
it it comes into our system um and in
 
00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:04.040 align:start position:0%
fact we can't move any quicker than that
 
00:13:06.269 --> 00:13:06.279 align:start position:0%
anyway just given our ratification
 
00:13:09.470 --> 00:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
process and and so on and so forth um so
 
00:13:11.870 --> 00:13:11.880 align:start position:0%
it would not bother us at all if that
 
00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:13.880 align:start position:0%
was amended to Simply change the two
 
00:13:15.150 --> 00:13:15.160 align:start position:0%
years to one
 
00:13:18.949 --> 00:13:18.959 align:start position:0%
year um the bill proposes that the
 
00:13:21.509 --> 00:13:21.519 align:start position:0%
long-standing energy code compliance
 
00:13:24.710 --> 00:13:24.720 align:start position:0%
form which is usable Statewide be
 
00:13:28.030 --> 00:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
adopted by Amendment rather than by rule
 
00:13:30.069 --> 00:13:30.079 align:start position:0%
in order that be in place when a new
 
00:13:32.470 --> 00:13:32.480 align:start position:0%
code is effective So currently the
 
00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:34.199 align:start position:0%
department of energy actually writes the
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
form for us and then we put it on our
 
00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:38.880 align:start position:0%
website if we have to go through a Ru
 
00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:40.880 align:start position:0%
making process there's a significant
 
00:13:43.629 --> 00:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
delay before that can come into effect
 
00:13:46.430 --> 00:13:46.440 align:start position:0%
and and in that case it it just you know
 
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.000 align:start position:0%
it always lags so by doing it with an
 
00:13:51.230 --> 00:13:51.240 align:start position:0%
amendment you simply ratify the form
 
00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:52.920 align:start position:0%
along with all the other amendments that
 
00:13:55.110 --> 00:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
to ratify and they would have the same
 
00:13:58.069 --> 00:13:58.079 align:start position:0%
uh same schedule as the codes itself uh
 
00:13:59.829 --> 00:13:59.839 align:start position:0%
we think that's a more effective way to
 
00:14:02.749 --> 00:14:02.759 align:start position:0%
get that that form out on the
 
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:05.560 align:start position:0%
street the bill clarifies that we're
 
00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:07.759 align:start position:0%
that we are in the appeals route for the
 
00:14:10.069 --> 00:14:10.079 align:start position:0%
election sorry the election the
 
00:14:12.150 --> 00:14:12.160 align:start position:0%
electrician's board the home inspector's
 
00:14:14.389 --> 00:14:14.399 align:start position:0%
board and the mechanical licensing board
 
00:14:16.829 --> 00:14:16.839 align:start position:0%
no change in responsibilities occurs it
 
00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
just clarifies in the statute uh which
 
00:14:22.069 --> 00:14:22.079 align:start position:0%
currently simply refer to the RSA number
 
00:14:24.749 --> 00:14:24.759 align:start position:0%
where those boards are buried as to what
 
00:14:26.030 --> 00:14:26.040 align:start position:0%
those boards
 
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:29.680 align:start position:0%
are uh we propose to repeat
 
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:32.680 align:start position:0%
15582 Roman numeral 5 as it it's
 
00:14:34.749 --> 00:14:34.759 align:start position:0%
duplicative it's it's addressed other
 
00:14:37.629 --> 00:14:37.639 align:start position:0%
places in the statute uh we proposed to
 
00:14:42.470 --> 00:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
repeal 155 A3 d a relative to biomass
 
00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
boilers uh that was a big thing back
 
00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:47.040 align:start position:0%
when it was written actually for a state
 
00:14:49.389 --> 00:14:49.399 align:start position:0%
project as I understand it it's all in
 
00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:51.120 align:start position:0%
the codes now it's pretty well
 
00:14:53.189 --> 00:14:53.199 align:start position:0%
established uh there really isn't a need
 
00:14:56.150 --> 00:14:56.160 align:start position:0%
for a statute to require us to permit
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
them because they're permitted by the
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
codes anyway and we've not heard any any
 
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:03.680 align:start position:0%
real tussle about that lately uh
 
00:15:07.069 --> 00:15:07.079 align:start position:0%
likewise 155 a3b is proposed to be
 
00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
repealed that addresses log structures
 
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:12.440 align:start position:0%
that was in a lot of state of flux back
 
00:15:14.670 --> 00:15:14.680 align:start position:0%
in the day there's now a standard out on
 
00:15:17.430 --> 00:15:17.440 align:start position:0%
how to build a log structure U and no
 
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:19.800 align:start position:0%
real need for a statute requiring us to
 
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:21.600 align:start position:0%
adopt the standard the standards in the
 
00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:23.189 align:start position:0%
adopt the standard the standards in the
code

00:15:23.189 --> 00:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
code
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
anyway uh then lastly the bill proposes
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
to repeal 150 5
 
00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
A1 uh Rome numeral 4E again it's simply
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
duplicative with other other sections of
 
00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:39.480 align:start position:0%
the RSA that cover the same thing um so
 
00:15:41.030 --> 00:15:41.040 align:start position:0%
all in all most of this bill is
 
00:15:43.509 --> 00:15:43.519 align:start position:0%
housekeeping uh in our opinion anyway
 
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:45.600 align:start position:0%
with a few material issues as just
 
00:15:47.790 --> 00:15:47.800 align:start position:0%
discussed and happy to answer any
 
00:15:49.710 --> 00:15:49.720 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much uh
 
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:52.160 align:start position:0%
representative leas thank you so uh this
 
00:15:54.829 --> 00:15:54.839 align:start position:0%
is a rela to page one line
 
00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:57.440 align:start position:0%
24 as far as the cost so is it the
 
00:15:59.430 --> 00:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
current current current practice you
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
said they're looking at whether it
 
00:16:03.069 --> 00:16:03.079 align:start position:0%
increases decreases or doesn't change it
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
is there in the current practice is
 
00:16:09.030 --> 00:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
there at least some idea of the estimate
 
00:16:13.470 --> 00:16:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:15.800 align:start position:0%
major the the problem with cost
 
00:16:17.749 --> 00:16:17.759 align:start position:0%
estimates is if we said well I need to
 
00:16:19.629 --> 00:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
put in that kind of a light
 
00:16:23.069 --> 00:16:23.079 align:start position:0%
fixture somebody on some of these things
 
00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
especially electrical items which tend
 
00:16:27.230 --> 00:16:27.240 align:start position:0%
to be discreet they're they're a thing
 
00:16:29.189 --> 00:16:29.199 align:start position:0%
you buy and you install
 
00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:31.720 align:start position:0%
somebody can put a cost on that no idea
 
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:34.040 align:start position:0%
how many times that gets used over the
 
00:16:35.870 --> 00:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
course of however long we might want to
 
00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
talk about it so the cost to an
 
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:40.040 align:start position:0%
individual project is one thing the cost
 
00:16:42.189 --> 00:16:42.199 align:start position:0%
to the population of the state is
 
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:45.560 align:start position:0%
something else again
 
00:16:48.069 --> 00:16:48.079 align:start position:0%
um I think certainly some of these
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
things are obvious uh when there's a
 
00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240 align:start position:0%
large cost I mean you know a reasonable
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
person can look at them and and decide
 
00:16:57.309 --> 00:16:57.319 align:start position:0%
that and the committee certainly take
 
00:16:59.030 --> 00:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
that into account
 
00:17:01.069 --> 00:17:01.079 align:start position:0%
uh so the our the Committees of our
 
00:17:02.990 --> 00:17:03.000 align:start position:0%
board that look at a specific code are
 
00:17:05.309 --> 00:17:05.319 align:start position:0%
the ones with expertise in using that
 
00:17:08.429 --> 00:17:08.439 align:start position:0%
code um and there have been several
 
00:17:09.949 --> 00:17:09.959 align:start position:0%
where they've said you know this is too
 
00:17:13.990 --> 00:17:14.000 align:start position:0%
big of a of a thing to bite follow up
 
00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:16.360 align:start position:0%
yes follow so do Ian is it where there
 
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:17.640 align:start position:0%
there is a case where it's reasonably
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
clear is that mentioned in the reports
 
00:17:22.029 --> 00:17:22.039 align:start position:0%
currently or you know whether or not I'm
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
sorry I didn't understand that question
 
00:17:28.110 --> 00:17:28.120 align:start position:0%
so um you mentioned something about a
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
report report coming out of this
 
00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:31.480 align:start position:0%
analysis is or did I
 
00:17:34.830 --> 00:17:34.840 align:start position:0%
misunderstand yes there and my apologies
 
00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:37.000 align:start position:0%
uh the reports sit on our website and
 
00:17:38.669 --> 00:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to get to this committee the
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
copies of those reports if you like they
 
00:17:43.789 --> 00:17:43.799 align:start position:0%
they basically take the published
 
00:17:46.430 --> 00:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
significant change booklets which just
 
00:17:48.310 --> 00:17:48.320 align:start position:0%
eliminate the little administrative and
 
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.280 align:start position:0%
typo errors um and go down each one of
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
them and assess this relative cost to it
 
00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
so followup follow up so my question is
 
00:17:59.669 --> 00:17:59.679 align:start position:0%
do those reports um at least point out
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
the ones where there's a expected to be
 
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
a significant
 
00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
impact U you know not a not a detailed
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
estimate but but that's that's perhaps
 
00:18:15.590 --> 00:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:18.950 --> 00:18:18.960 align:start position:0%
you any other questions seeing none
 
00:18:20.590 --> 00:18:20.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman appreciate it
 
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.750 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman appreciate it
thank

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:27.710 --> 00:18:27.720 align:start position:0%
you um just real briefly representative
 
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:34.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:40.149 --> 00:18:40.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:42.510 --> 00:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
cool I have I have two more cards real
 
00:18:45.350 --> 00:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
quick but I do
 
00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.110 align:start position:0%
quick but I do
yeah

00:18:47.110 --> 00:18:47.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:00.510 align:start position:0%
 
Mayberry

00:19:00.510 --> 00:19:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:01.990 --> 00:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
good morning good morning chairman good
 
00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:03.159 align:start position:0%
morning committee members my name is
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
Matt Mayberry I live in Dober New
 
00:19:06.909 --> 00:19:06.919 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm the Executive Vice
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
President of the New Hampshire
 
00:19:10.549 --> 00:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
homebuilders Association so you'll be
 
00:19:13.149 --> 00:19:13.159 align:start position:0%
hearing seeing us a lot
 
00:19:16.549 --> 00:19:16.559 align:start position:0%
today the bcrb and Phil Sherman do an
 
00:19:18.149 --> 00:19:18.159 align:start position:0%
amazing job I didn't realize how much
 
00:19:20.270 --> 00:19:20.280 align:start position:0%
work they did till I started sitting in
 
00:19:22.750 --> 00:19:22.760 align:start position:0%
these meetings and they do a great
 
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:24.960 align:start position:0%
job the New Hampshire homebuilders
 
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
Association is in disagreement with one
 
00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:30.360 align:start position:0%
proposal it's line 26 and
 
00:19:33.909 --> 00:19:33.919 align:start position:0%
27 it's the deletion of that has been
 
00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:36.240 align:start position:0%
published for two
 
00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:39.200 align:start position:0%
years what we've done in practice
 
00:19:41.870 --> 00:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
Representatives is that we've let other
 
00:19:44.270 --> 00:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
states adopt codes and we see how they
 
00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:47.120 align:start position:0%
adapt to it if it works for them if it
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't work for
 
00:19:51.270 --> 00:19:51.280 align:start position:0%
them and then we we learn from their
 
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:53.640 align:start position:0%
mistakes so we're always kind of a code
 
00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:54.630 align:start position:0%
mistakes so we're always kind of a code
cycle

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
cycle
 
00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
behind other parts of the nation um
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
along roughly with 31 other states do
 
00:20:02.789 --> 00:20:02.799 align:start position:0%
the same thing and so I'm just asking
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
the committee to please
 
00:20:07.909 --> 00:20:07.919 align:start position:0%
consider not um enacting the change on
 
00:20:12.190 --> 00:20:12.200 align:start position:0%
lines 26 and 27 and let us remain behind
 
00:20:14.029 --> 00:20:14.039 align:start position:0%
one cycle and let other states make
 
00:20:16.669 --> 00:20:16.679 align:start position:0%
mistakes and we'll learn from them thank
 
00:20:20.510 --> 00:20:20.520 align:start position:0%
you for your time today thank you any
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:24.760 align:start position:0%
time appreciate
 
00:20:27.149 --> 00:20:27.159 align:start position:0%
it um Michael
 
00:20:27.159 --> 00:20:30.750 align:start position:0%
it um Michael
Harrison

00:20:30.750 --> 00:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:39.360 align:start position:0%
opposition uh Fe just turn your mic on
 
00:20:41.789 --> 00:20:41.799 align:start position:0%
there thank you good morning members of
 
00:20:42.909 --> 00:20:42.919 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Michael
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
Harrison um I live in Penacook New
 
00:20:48.390 --> 00:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I'm a licensed plumber and a
 
00:20:49.789 --> 00:20:49.799 align:start position:0%
member of the mechanical safety and
 
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
Licensing Board um the mechanical safety
 
00:20:54.590 --> 00:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
and Licensing Board would just like to
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
speak in opposition of one section uh in
 
00:21:00.470 --> 00:21:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:04.000 align:start position:0%
1551a uh specifically to the appeals
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
process um it's our understanding that
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
the mechanical licensing board at this
 
00:21:11.870 --> 00:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
time uh is not subject to such an
 
00:21:14.950 --> 00:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
appeals process to the building code
 
00:21:18.149 --> 00:21:18.159 align:start position:0%
board um we would not be in favor of
 
00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:21.240 align:start position:0%
such a change uh we do we don't believe
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
that um such oversight is
 
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:28.840 align:start position:0%
required great any questions yes
 
00:21:31.269 --> 00:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
representative Gera thank you so what is
 
00:21:34.590 --> 00:21:34.600 align:start position:0%
your process right now for um that
 
00:21:37.630 --> 00:21:37.640 align:start position:0%
wouldn't require this appeal thank you
 
00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:40.000 align:start position:0%
for the question currently the process
 
00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:42.600 align:start position:0%
by which appeals
 
00:21:45.950 --> 00:21:45.960 align:start position:0%
of code disputes within the state comes
 
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:48.880 align:start position:0%
to the board is through um the
 
00:21:51.909 --> 00:21:51.919 align:start position:0%
mechanical safety and Licensing arm of
 
00:21:53.549 --> 00:21:53.559 align:start position:0%
the oplc
 
00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.080 align:start position:0%
specifically um our state inspectors um
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
also through the public
 
00:22:02.549 --> 00:22:02.559 align:start position:0%
um through a process of reporting um
 
00:22:04.110 --> 00:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
those reports are investigated by
 
00:22:06.070 --> 00:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
members of the oplc and then brought to
 
00:22:11.390 --> 00:22:11.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:15.080 align:start position:0%
rulings follow thank you fellow thank
 
00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:17.669 align:start position:0%
rulings follow thank you fellow thank
you

00:22:17.669 --> 00:22:17.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:20.840 align:start position:0%
so why would wouldn't this process be
 
00:22:23.950 --> 00:22:23.960 align:start position:0%
more expedient than the
 
00:22:26.710 --> 00:22:26.720 align:start position:0%
other um our understanding is that this
 
00:22:29.909 --> 00:22:29.919 align:start position:0%
process would be in addition to
 
00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.120 align:start position:0%
hours so decisions made by the
 
00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
mechanical safety and Licensing Board
 
00:22:36.870 --> 00:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
could be appealed um to a higher level
 
00:22:40.149 --> 00:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
um that process currently isn't in place
 
00:22:45.230 --> 00:22:45.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
it representative
 
00:22:51.470 --> 00:22:51.480 align:start position:0%
goie thank you Mr chair and I want to go
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
back to I
 
00:22:56.269 --> 00:22:56.279 align:start position:0%
guess is it on lines 11 on page two that
 
00:23:00.909 --> 00:23:00.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:03.269 --> 00:23:03.279 align:start position:0%
I'm not correct in reading this that the
 
00:23:05.310 --> 00:23:05.320 align:start position:0%
only changes were putting the words
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
determining what the boards are the rsas
 
00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039 align:start position:0%
are referring to the boards it just
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
clarifies in statute what the board is
 
00:23:15.029 --> 00:23:15.039 align:start position:0%
uh I don't disagree with you but I don't
 
00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:16.240 align:start position:0%
believe that mechanical safety and
 
00:23:19.190 --> 00:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
Licensing was listed
 
00:23:23.230 --> 00:23:23.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
up my understanding is that it was
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
specifically in relation to electrical
 
00:23:30.269 --> 00:23:30.279 align:start position:0%
and Home
 
00:23:32.549 --> 00:23:32.559 align:start position:0%
Inspection just a question I guess then
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
for the chair because I see only the
 
00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:35.840 align:start position:0%
wording mechanical licensing and I can I
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
guess I'll have to pull up the RSA I
 
00:23:39.789 --> 00:23:39.799 align:start position:0%
think it's just the wording putting the
 
00:23:51.950 --> 00:23:51.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:54.390 --> 00:23:54.400 align:start position:0%
it yeah but I need a it's a little bit
 
00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.240 align:start position:0%
longer than I thought it was going to
 
00:23:56.870 --> 00:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
make I need
 
00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.710 align:start position:0%
make I need
a

00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:05.430 --> 00:24:05.440 align:start position:0%
a uh representative you got it yeah um
 
00:24:08.909 --> 00:24:08.919 align:start position:0%
it it is um or
 
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
319c is the section for electricians and
 
00:24:16.669 --> 00:24:16.679 align:start position:0%
C4 is the board so um as far as I can
 
00:24:19.750 --> 00:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
read the existing statute the is it the
 
00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:22.310 align:start position:0%
read the existing statute the is it the
electricians

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
electricians
 
00:24:24.789 --> 00:24:24.799 align:start position:0%
or you're concerned about uh no
 
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:26.720 align:start position:0%
mechanical safety and Licensing okay
 
00:24:34.029 --> 00:24:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:36.590 --> 00:24:36.600 align:start position:0%
153 I'm looking at it now and the
 
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
statute states that it uh also
 
00:24:43.310 --> 00:24:43.320 align:start position:0%
establishes under RSA 153 27A which
 
00:24:45.389 --> 00:24:45.399 align:start position:0%
it just adds in mechanical licensing
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
statute yeah we'll certainly take a look
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
at it there's no need for uh you to sit
 
00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:55.960 align:start position:0%
while we discuss it um we can discuss it
 
00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:57.760 align:start position:0%
when we go into exact session the
 
00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:00.000 align:start position:0%
mechanical licing session is there but
 
00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
I'm not seeing the part pertaining to
 
00:25:06.470 --> 00:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
appeals um so I'd like to figure out if
 
00:25:07.669 --> 00:25:07.679 align:start position:0%
that's the case and maybe actually we
 
00:25:09.070 --> 00:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
could have Mr Sherman come back up and
 
00:25:11.310 --> 00:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
clarify for us but was did you have
 
00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:12.520 align:start position:0%
anything else that you wish to testify
 
00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:13.600 align:start position:0%
no that was it thank you for your time
 
00:25:15.830 --> 00:25:15.840 align:start position:0%
thank you very much appreciate it Mr
 
00:25:24.870 --> 00:25:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
quickly thank you Mr chair U I'll just
 
00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:29.000 align:start position:0%
read the section to you the way it
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
stands today the board shall hear
 
00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:33.480 align:start position:0%
appeals of final decisions from the
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
board established under 319 C4 that's
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
the electricians board we just add the
 
00:25:41.470 --> 00:25:41.480 align:start position:0%
name electricians board the board
 
00:25:45.590 --> 00:25:45.600 align:start position:0%
established under RSA 310a 186 that's
 
00:25:47.669 --> 00:25:47.679 align:start position:0%
the home inspector's board we just add
 
00:25:50.350 --> 00:25:50.360 align:start position:0%
the label home inspector and the
 
00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:52.360 align:start position:0%
mechanic I'm sorry and the board
 
00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
established under RSA 153 27A which is
 
00:25:58.149 --> 00:25:58.159 align:start position:0%
already the mechanical license ing board
 
00:25:59.870 --> 00:25:59.880 align:start position:0%
we're just adding we're just clarifying
 
00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:03.080 align:start position:0%
the label for um those of us who don't
 
00:26:06.750 --> 00:26:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
memorized um representative gold and
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
then representative L
 
00:26:14.149 --> 00:26:14.159 align:start position:0%
us so uh thank you Mr chair and thank
 
00:26:16.310 --> 00:26:16.320 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question so just to
 
00:26:19.830 --> 00:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
clarify this this language in the new
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
bill would not replace any procedures
 
00:26:24.590 --> 00:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
that are currently happening changes
 
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:26.720 align:start position:0%
nothing it just clarifies the bill so
 
00:26:28.310 --> 00:26:28.320 align:start position:0%
you can read it and what we're talking
 
00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:30.640 align:start position:0%
about thank you yeah I found it thank
 
00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:34.520 align:start position:0%
you representative lakas question
 
00:26:37.549 --> 00:26:37.559 align:start position:0%
um actually at this point no it it's I
 
00:26:40.430 --> 00:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
mean he was asking about mechanical and
 
00:26:43.870 --> 00:26:43.880 align:start position:0%
1 for 327a is the mechanical license is
 
00:26:45.789 --> 00:26:45.799 align:start position:0%
mechanical license and somebody asked a
 
00:26:45.799 --> 00:26:47.190 align:start position:0%
mechanical license and somebody asked a
question

00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:50.240 align:start position:0%
about anyway they have they can conduct
 
00:26:52.269 --> 00:26:52.279 align:start position:0%
hearings for disciplinary
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
stuff but um anyway it just adds the
 
00:26:59.630 --> 00:26:59.640 align:start position:0%
name yep it does it refers to the it
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
refers to the RSA and we're just
 
00:27:03.430 --> 00:27:03.440 align:start position:0%
changing that with the name mechanical
 
00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:05.640 align:start position:0%
licensing so we found it thank you for
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:16.029 --> 00:27:16.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:18.290 --> 00:27:18.300 align:start position:0%
Williams welcome back to
 
00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:21.549 align:start position:0%
Williams welcome back to
[Music]

00:27:21.549 --> 00:27:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:23.830 --> 00:27:23.840 align:start position:0%
Edna uh yeah your microphone please
 
00:27:24.909 --> 00:27:24.919 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you so much it's a
 
00:27:27.110 --> 00:27:27.120 align:start position:0%
pleasure to be here uh good morning
 
00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:29.120 align:start position:0%
represent Rebecca McWilliams from South
 
00:27:31.190 --> 00:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
conquered um I want to thank the bill
 
00:27:32.789 --> 00:27:32.799 align:start position:0%
sponsor for bringing forward this bill I
 
00:27:34.549 --> 00:27:34.559 align:start position:0%
think this is an important housekeeping
 
00:27:36.710 --> 00:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
bill um and perhaps as a bit of a
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
preview of Coming Attractions I just
 
00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399 align:start position:0%
want to stress how important it is um on
 
00:27:44.070 --> 00:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
the first page line
 
00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:46.880 align:start position:0%
26 uh that we strike the fact that it
 
00:27:48.549 --> 00:27:48.559 align:start position:0%
needed to have been published for two
 
00:27:50.590 --> 00:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
years in order to review a newer version
 
00:27:52.990 --> 00:27:53.000 align:start position:0%
of a code uh things have changed a lot
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
since we were receiving paper and bound
 
00:27:58.430 --> 00:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
copies of codes to review now
 
00:28:00.070 --> 00:28:00.080 align:start position:0%
everything's available online it's much
 
00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:03.360 align:start position:0%
easier to access the 2024 code you can
 
00:28:05.590 --> 00:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
search it and read it at your own
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
convenience uh and so I think this is a
 
00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
barrier that has been holding things
 
00:28:11.830 --> 00:28:11.840 align:start position:0%
back for us to do the review at the bcrb
 
00:28:13.149 --> 00:28:13.159 align:start position:0%
so I want to thank you for your time and
 
00:28:15.230 --> 00:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
just stress that point I'm happy to
 
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:20.950 align:start position:0%
 
questions

00:28:20.950 --> 00:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:28:26.830 --> 00:28:26.840 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you Mr chair um do do you
 
00:28:28.789 --> 00:28:28.799 align:start position:0%
feel that need to wait do we need to
 
00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:30.320 align:start position:0%
have that time frame that some of the
 
00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:32.440 align:start position:0%
others testifiers have mentioned a year
 
00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:36.000 align:start position:0%
or two so that we can properly uh review
 
00:28:39.430 --> 00:28:39.440 align:start position:0%
what other states have done or I'm leave
 
00:28:42.549 --> 00:28:42.559 align:start position:0%
it at that thank you for the question uh
 
00:28:44.509 --> 00:28:44.519 align:start position:0%
so as as I think we all know in this
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
room the code comes out in threee Cycles
 
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
so 18 21 24 uh so you already have the
 
00:28:53.029 --> 00:28:53.039 align:start position:0%
latest and grest when you're considering
 
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
the current years's code pretty much
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
give or take um and I I don't think we
 
00:29:00.110 --> 00:29:00.120 align:start position:0%
ever want to be on The Cutting Edge in
 
00:29:02.389 --> 00:29:02.399 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire we we tend to be a little
 
00:29:03.950 --> 00:29:03.960 align:start position:0%
conservative and we'd like to wait and
 
00:29:06.269 --> 00:29:06.279 align:start position:0%
see 3 years to see what's happening with
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
the 24 codes before we adopt them so
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
we're currently not looking at the 24
 
00:29:11.669 --> 00:29:11.679 align:start position:0%
codes in
 
00:29:14.350 --> 00:29:14.360 align:start position:0%
2024 uh in terms of letting us see what
 
00:29:16.029 --> 00:29:16.039 align:start position:0%
other states are up to that's kind of a
 
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:17.640 align:start position:0%
natural outgrowth of being on a
 
00:29:20.149 --> 00:29:20.159 align:start position:0%
three-year cycle um I don't see us
 
00:29:22.590 --> 00:29:22.600 align:start position:0%
proposing to adopt midcycle to try to
 
00:29:25.549 --> 00:29:25.559 align:start position:0%
jump up to the 24 code in in a year
 
00:29:29.350 --> 00:29:29.360 align:start position:0%
before uh 27 right so we're at 2024
 
00:29:31.630 --> 00:29:31.640 align:start position:0%
looking at 2021 so we'll be at 2027
 
00:29:32.630 --> 00:29:32.640 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:29:35.509 --> 00:29:35.519 align:start position:0%
2024 um so I think it's it's sort of
 
00:29:37.750 --> 00:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
like a built-in buffer and safety for us
 
00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:40.360 align:start position:0%
to see what's going on uh and I don't
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
think that's going to change but is it
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
really necessary that's kind of for open
 
00:29:45.399 --> 00:29:46.549 align:start position:0%
really necessary that's kind of for open
for

00:29:46.549 --> 00:29:46.559 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:29:48.269 --> 00:29:48.279 align:start position:0%
interpretation y thank you
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
representative BR representative leas
 
00:29:53.269 --> 00:29:53.279 align:start position:0%
thank you um so I think you're you
 
00:29:55.509 --> 00:29:55.519 align:start position:0%
mentioned that um we're always going to
 
00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:58.039 align:start position:0%
be three years behind anyway uh is that
 
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:01.120 align:start position:0%
in statute somewhere or is it just
 
00:30:03.350 --> 00:30:03.360 align:start position:0%
practice uh you know I would have to go
 
00:30:05.190 --> 00:30:05.200 align:start position:0%
back through the rsas to really answer
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
the question as to whether we need to
 
00:30:09.149 --> 00:30:09.159 align:start position:0%
delay in statute but it has been our
 
00:30:11.110 --> 00:30:11.120 align:start position:0%
common practice to stay three years
 
00:30:14.190 --> 00:30:14.200 align:start position:0%
behind as also most of the states around
 
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:16.120 align:start position:0%
us it seems to be sort of a New England
 
00:30:18.549 --> 00:30:18.559 align:start position:0%
attitude but I can't tell you yes or no
 
00:30:20.190 --> 00:30:20.200 align:start position:0%
based on statute all right thank you and
 
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:21.440 align:start position:0%
Mr chair if there's somebody here who
 
00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:23.039 align:start position:0%
might be able to answer that it would be
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
helpful sure we can see if Mr Sherman
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
can he seems happy to thank you
 
00:30:32.950 --> 00:30:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
time give us a little time Mr shman
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:42.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you Mr chair there
 
00:30:44.549 --> 00:30:44.559 align:start position:0%
there's an intermediate step that's
 
00:30:46.630 --> 00:30:46.640 align:start position:0%
useful to remember and that is that we
 
00:30:48.789 --> 00:30:48.799 align:start position:0%
have a standing legislative advisory
 
00:30:50.710 --> 00:30:50.720 align:start position:0%
committee on building and fire codes now
 
00:30:51.870 --> 00:30:51.880 align:start position:0%
and some of the members of this
 
00:30:55.669 --> 00:30:55.679 align:start position:0%
committee sit on that committee so we
 
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:58.880 align:start position:0%
have a a fair
 
00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:00.909 align:start position:0%
have a a fair
um

00:31:00.909 --> 00:31:00.919 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:04.190 --> 00:31:04.200 align:start position:0%
obvious ability to know whether we're
 
00:31:07.590 --> 00:31:07.600 align:start position:0%
getting off the rails early so I can't
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
say that there's a statute that
 
00:31:12.470 --> 00:31:12.480 align:start position:0%
prohibits really quick updates to the
 
00:31:15.470 --> 00:31:15.480 align:start position:0%
codes uh but there is a general sense
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
which we've heard from members of the
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
legislature and most of us agree with
 
00:31:21.549 --> 00:31:21.559 align:start position:0%
that the the code is published on a
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
three-year cycle we ought to be adopting
 
00:31:25.190 --> 00:31:25.200 align:start position:0%
things on a three-year cycle and the
 
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:28.000 align:start position:0%
question is how far is the off set with
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
those those two cycles um it's difficult
 
00:31:34.110 --> 00:31:34.120 align:start position:0%
to write that kind of thing into statute
 
00:31:36.549 --> 00:31:36.559 align:start position:0%
because weird stuff happens
 
00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:40.120 align:start position:0%
Co right now the 2024 energy code is
 
00:31:42.509 --> 00:31:42.519 align:start position:0%
held up on the model code side through
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
appeals it hasn't been published yet
 
00:31:46.509 --> 00:31:46.519 align:start position:0%
whereas the other ones have so it's not
 
00:31:49.029 --> 00:31:49.039 align:start position:0%
a a completely smooth system at at any
 
00:31:51.669 --> 00:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
level uh but certainly there's a desire
 
00:31:54.269 --> 00:31:54.279 align:start position:0%
on the part of a lot of us to to at some
 
00:31:56.310 --> 00:31:56.320 align:start position:0%
point get on to some kind of an orderly
 
00:31:57.789 --> 00:31:57.799 align:start position:0%
three-year cycle
 
00:31:59.430 --> 00:31:59.440 align:start position:0%
where the outer world knows New
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire updates their codes you know
 
00:32:03.149 --> 00:32:03.159 align:start position:0%
roughly at this
 
00:32:06.389 --> 00:32:06.399 align:start position:0%
point it's a bit of a Holy Grail but you
 
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
may get
 
00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:11.880 align:start position:0%
there res us we just saying thank you
 
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:14.200 align:start position:0%
okay um real quick uh one question for
 
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
me um who is on The Cutting Edge what
 
00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:19.360 align:start position:0%
what states are the quickest out and and
 
00:32:21.669 --> 00:32:21.679 align:start position:0%
what's their time frame um in comparison
 
00:32:23.830 --> 00:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
to the release of the
 
00:32:25.950 --> 00:32:25.960 align:start position:0%
information I don't know the answer to
 
00:32:28.750 --> 00:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
that question right now what I can say
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
is that I sense more of a drift in
 
00:32:33.789 --> 00:32:33.799 align:start position:0%
recent years to try and get onto an
 
00:32:36.629 --> 00:32:36.639 align:start position:0%
orderly schedule it may be quick it may
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
be slow but but rather than uh what a
 
00:32:42.590 --> 00:32:42.600 align:start position:0%
lot of the States including ours has
 
00:32:44.149 --> 00:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
have gone through where they sort of
 
00:32:46.509 --> 00:32:46.519 align:start position:0%
stick with an old code for longer than
 
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:49.080 align:start position:0%
they wished and then they jump sometimes
 
00:32:51.629 --> 00:32:51.639 align:start position:0%
we've jumped additions in order to to
 
00:32:55.070 --> 00:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
catch up with things um so I think
 
00:32:58.070 --> 00:32:58.080 align:start position:0%
there's a desire I I will never say
 
00:32:59.470 --> 00:32:59.480 align:start position:0%
Nationwide there are states that don't
 
00:33:01.870 --> 00:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
even have a Statewide building code yet
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
uh but you know there's a desire the
 
00:33:06.070 --> 00:33:06.080 align:start position:0%
people that I talk to to kind of get
 
00:33:08.310 --> 00:33:08.320 align:start position:0%
things sorted out so there's some some
 
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:11.480 align:start position:0%
sense of of of a repetitive schedule
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
syncopation if you
 
00:33:17.509 --> 00:33:17.519 align:start position:0%
will any other questions seeing none
 
00:33:22.590 --> 00:33:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
you and um we have three
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.669 --> 00:33:37.679 align:start position:0%
good morning Matt Mayberry from the New
 
00:33:39.430 --> 00:33:39.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Home Builders once again I
 
00:33:42.509 --> 00:33:42.519 align:start position:0%
have the answer to that question it's
 
00:33:45.269 --> 00:33:45.279 align:start position:0%
currently five states that are using the
 
00:33:47.310 --> 00:33:47.320 align:start position:0%
most recent bills and those are
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Connecticut Montana Nevada and
 
00:33:50.039 --> 00:33:51.230 align:start position:0%
Louisiana Connecticut Montana Nevada and
New

00:33:51.230 --> 00:33:51.240 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:33:53.269 --> 00:33:53.279 align:start position:0%
Jersey and the one thing I like to add
 
00:33:57.029 --> 00:33:57.039 align:start position:0%
is if it's just presumed or common PR
 
00:34:00.029 --> 00:34:00.039 align:start position:0%
practice then why we just leave it in
 
00:34:03.509 --> 00:34:03.519 align:start position:0%
writing okay thank you very
 
00:34:07.270 --> 00:34:07.280 align:start position:0%
much did anybody else wish to testify on
 
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:10.389 align:start position:0%
much did anybody else wish to testify on
HB

00:34:10.389 --> 00:34:10.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:14.829 --> 00:34:14.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
hearing and we're up until 10:30 unless
 
00:34:20.909 --> 00:34:20.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:23.349 --> 00:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
exec no we got like one
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:55.550 --> 00:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
it's 10:30 so I'd like to open the
 
00:35:57.910 --> 00:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
public hearing on hb10 1059 relative to
 
00:35:59.430 --> 00:35:59.440 align:start position:0%
the State Building Code and welcome back
 
00:36:06.829 --> 00:36:06.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you house Carol Maguire
 
00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:12.880 align:start position:0%
representing marac District
 
00:36:15.390 --> 00:36:15.400 align:start position:0%
27 and House Bill
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
1059 is
 
00:36:22.069 --> 00:36:22.079 align:start position:0%
the Fairly regular update to the State
 
00:36:22.079 --> 00:36:23.790 align:start position:0%
the Fairly regular update to the State
Building

00:36:23.790 --> 00:36:23.800 align:start position:0%
Building
 
00:36:28.430 --> 00:36:28.440 align:start position:0%
Code so it includes the update to the
 
00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.589 align:start position:0%
Code so it includes the update to the
building

00:36:29.589 --> 00:36:29.599 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:36:33.750 --> 00:36:33.760 align:start position:0%
code mostly to the 2021 version
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
including the amendments ratified by the
 
00:36:41.550 --> 00:36:41.560 align:start position:0%
board um will need to change the
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
December 8th 2023 date to January 12th
 
00:36:50.470 --> 00:36:50.480 align:start position:0%
2024 because that was the last meeting
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
of the building code review board and
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
there are some amendments
 
00:36:57.109 --> 00:36:57.119 align:start position:0%
there um if you want to know the
 
00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:00.800 align:start position:0%
technical details of the Amendments I've
 
00:37:04.510 --> 00:37:04.520 align:start position:0%
sent them out in very large PDF
 
00:37:07.270 --> 00:37:07.280 align:start position:0%
packages um or you can ask Mr Sherman
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
who will no doubt be testifying
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
shortly the building code review board
 
00:37:16.829 --> 00:37:16.839 align:start position:0%
did not approve the update to the energy
 
00:37:20.950 --> 00:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
code that was a split decision and with
 
00:37:23.230 --> 00:37:23.240 align:start position:0%
the help of Representative MC Williams I
 
00:37:25.829 --> 00:37:25.839 align:start position:0%
have included or I have pres I'm
 
00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.200 align:start position:0%
presenting an
 
00:37:31.309 --> 00:37:31.319 align:start position:0%
amendment that updates the energy code
 
00:37:31.319 --> 00:37:32.990 align:start position:0%
amendment that updates the energy code
as

00:37:32.990 --> 00:37:33.000 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:37:35.589 --> 00:37:35.599 align:start position:0%
well I do not personally support
 
00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
updating the energy code for reasons
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
you'll hear from other people but I
 
00:37:43.230 --> 00:37:43.240 align:start position:0%
think we need to debate it it was a
 
00:37:46.349 --> 00:37:46.359 align:start position:0%
split decision on the board and if we do
 
00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:48.760 align:start position:0%
in update the energy code we want to
 
00:37:51.309 --> 00:37:51.319 align:start position:0%
include the building code review board
 
00:37:53.349 --> 00:37:53.359 align:start position:0%
amendments most of which are carried
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
forward from the current
 
00:37:55.599 --> 00:37:57.150 align:start position:0%
forward from the current
version

00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
version
 
00:37:58.910 --> 00:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
and which were approved at the meeting
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
on January 12th so here is that
 
00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:13.109 --> 00:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
real basically it goes to the later
 
00:38:16.309 --> 00:38:16.319 align:start position:0%
version of the energy code which was not
 
00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:18.680 align:start position:0%
recommended by the building code review
 
00:38:22.550 --> 00:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
board and updates the date of the final
 
00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:26.680 align:start position:0%
meeting so if you have any question and
 
00:38:30.069 --> 00:38:30.079 align:start position:0%
I believe that that code needs to
 
00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:34.960 align:start position:0%
be considered with the other
 
00:38:37.630 --> 00:38:37.640 align:start position:0%
updates if anyone wants to have it and
 
00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:39.520 align:start position:0%
i' and from the emails I've been getting
 
00:38:42.150 --> 00:38:42.160 align:start position:0%
quite a few people do so if you have any
 
00:38:44.349 --> 00:38:44.359 align:start position:0%
questions I'll be glad to answer
 
00:38:46.390 --> 00:38:46.400 align:start position:0%
them thank you very much representative
 
00:38:48.990 --> 00:38:49.000 align:start position:0%
leas thank you uh can you tell us what
 
00:38:52.829 --> 00:38:52.839 align:start position:0%
the uh strike out of the last sentences
 
00:38:55.710 --> 00:38:55.720 align:start position:0%
about that's in the that's in the basic
 
00:38:55.720 --> 00:39:00.510 align:start position:0%
about that's in the that's in the basic
bill

00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:03.720 align:start position:0%
um no I can't sorry but it is not a
 
00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800 align:start position:0%
change from the original bill it's yeah
 
00:39:09.309 --> 00:39:09.319 align:start position:0%
I understand it's just in there I'm sure
 
00:39:11.950 --> 00:39:11.960 align:start position:0%
Mr Sherman can
 
00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:14.240 align:start position:0%
answer any other
 
00:39:17.790 --> 00:39:17.800 align:start position:0%
questions thank you representative
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:33.349 align:start position:0%
 
Williams

00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:33.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:34.910 --> 00:39:34.920 align:start position:0%
good morning again chair members of the
 
00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:36.680 align:start position:0%
committee representative McWilliams from
 
00:39:39.390 --> 00:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
South conquer um I want to thank uh
 
00:39:41.950 --> 00:39:41.960 align:start position:0%
representative McGuire chair Maguire for
 
00:39:44.990 --> 00:39:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh presenting the original Bill 1059 and
 
00:39:47.430 --> 00:39:47.440 align:start position:0%
also the amendment um which includes the
 
00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:50.040 align:start position:0%
energy code and uh with the few minutes
 
00:39:51.470 --> 00:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
that I have to just give you a little
 
00:39:54.589 --> 00:39:54.599 align:start position:0%
background um in my day job I work as an
 
00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:57.200 align:start position:0%
architect um I work with a a very large
 
00:39:59.430 --> 00:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
Nationwide firm that does architecture
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
engineering and construction for huge
 
00:40:03.829 --> 00:40:03.839 align:start position:0%
industrial facilities uh some of our
 
00:40:06.109 --> 00:40:06.119 align:start position:0%
clients include Coke and Pepsi kyoga
 
00:40:09.150 --> 00:40:09.160 align:start position:0%
milk um the Kellogg companies we do a
 
00:40:11.230 --> 00:40:11.240 align:start position:0%
lot of work for facilities that have
 
00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:13.760 align:start position:0%
large freezers large warehouses very
 
00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:17.280 align:start position:0%
small office space why is this important
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
because they're commercial uh and
 
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
because these very large facilities are
 
00:40:24.030 --> 00:40:24.040 align:start position:0%
often large energy users uh to things do
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
things like uh chill and freeze their
 
00:40:28.270 --> 00:40:28.280 align:start position:0%
products milk and ice cream as an
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
example uh so when we talk about the
 
00:40:31.910 --> 00:40:31.920 align:start position:0%
energy code and when we talk about
 
00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:34.280 align:start position:0%
updating all the codes in New Hampshire
 
00:40:36.309 --> 00:40:36.319 align:start position:0%
uh these clients when they're located in
 
00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.000 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire will be looking to what is
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
the code requirement for when I'm doing
 
00:40:41.990 --> 00:40:42.000 align:start position:0%
either a major renovation an addition or
 
00:40:44.829 --> 00:40:44.839 align:start position:0%
a new facility here in New Hampshire and
 
00:40:48.190 --> 00:40:48.200 align:start position:0%
I would pause it to you that it matters
 
00:40:50.510 --> 00:40:50.520 align:start position:0%
uh whether they are able to send someone
 
00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:52.680 align:start position:0%
out and commission to make sure that the
 
00:40:55.550 --> 00:40:55.560 align:start position:0%
freezer is not leaking cold air out into
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
the atmosphere and wasting money um as a
 
00:41:01.790 --> 00:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
baseline in our code rather than saying
 
00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
that's up to you you can choose to go
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
above and beyond the code and check to
 
00:41:06.910 --> 00:41:06.920 align:start position:0%
see if the freezer is actually losing
 
00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:10.079 align:start position:0%
its cooling out into the world um we as
 
00:41:12.510 --> 00:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
a state care about energy use we care
 
00:41:15.150 --> 00:41:15.160 align:start position:0%
about um our electricity lines and our
 
00:41:17.550 --> 00:41:17.560 align:start position:0%
natural gas pipelines and having to
 
00:41:19.750 --> 00:41:19.760 align:start position:0%
increase transmission and natural gas
 
00:41:21.510 --> 00:41:21.520 align:start position:0%
pipelines because of increased
 
00:41:23.390 --> 00:41:23.400 align:start position:0%
production and not keeping up with
 
00:41:25.270 --> 00:41:25.280 align:start position:0%
Energy Efficiency and commissioning
 
00:41:28.349 --> 00:41:28.359 align:start position:0%
would be a lack on are part of oversight
 
00:41:29.670 --> 00:41:29.680 align:start position:0%
um so for that reason I'm very
 
00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:31.240 align:start position:0%
passionate about including commercial
 
00:41:33.390 --> 00:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
commissioning as a baseline in our
 
00:41:35.349 --> 00:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
energy code and making sure that that's
 
00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:36.720 align:start position:0%
something that we're fighting for when
 
00:41:39.390 --> 00:41:39.400 align:start position:0%
we're increasing the codes to the 2021
 
00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
uh because if we don't do that then we
 
00:41:42.750 --> 00:41:42.760 align:start position:0%
as a state are simply allowing some of
 
00:41:44.630 --> 00:41:44.640 align:start position:0%
these things to become normal when they
 
00:41:46.430 --> 00:41:46.440 align:start position:0%
don't need to be normal we can have
 
00:41:47.670 --> 00:41:47.680 align:start position:0%
someone come out and immediately
 
00:41:49.270 --> 00:41:49.280 align:start position:0%
commission as soon as construction is
 
00:41:50.790 --> 00:41:50.800 align:start position:0%
done and make sure that the building
 
00:41:53.550 --> 00:41:53.560 align:start position:0%
envelope is not leaking so uh thank you
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
very much I'm happy to answer questions
 
00:41:57.309 --> 00:41:57.319 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for your testimony
 
00:41:59.950 --> 00:41:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh representative leakas thank you so if
 
00:42:03.430 --> 00:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
we were not to um include this change on
 
00:42:06.270 --> 00:42:06.280 align:start position:0%
the en energy conservation code is there
 
00:42:08.750 --> 00:42:08.760 align:start position:0%
anything um in statute rules or the
 
00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:10.119 align:start position:0%
building code that would prevent a
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
company from
 
00:42:13.630 --> 00:42:13.640 align:start position:0%
specifying that certain additional
 
00:42:16.190 --> 00:42:16.200 align:start position:0%
things uh beyond what might be in the
 
00:42:19.190 --> 00:42:19.200 align:start position:0%
code uh be done as part of you know
 
00:42:21.630 --> 00:42:21.640 align:start position:0%
their contract have the building Bill
 
00:42:22.549 --> 00:42:22.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:42:24.750 --> 00:42:24.760 align:start position:0%
representative leus I think this is
 
00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:26.960 align:start position:0%
always the debate that we have in any of
 
00:42:29.390 --> 00:42:29.400 align:start position:0%
these committees can we do more without
 
00:42:33.109 --> 00:42:33.119 align:start position:0%
making it a a law absolutely we are free
 
00:42:34.829 --> 00:42:34.839 align:start position:0%
citizens we can always do more we can
 
00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
choose where we spend our money however
 
00:42:38.990 --> 00:42:39.000 align:start position:0%
when there is a public burden when it
 
00:42:40.790 --> 00:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
comes to the public to pay for the
 
00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:43.000 align:start position:0%
overall average cost of infrastructure
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
for some of these things by not
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
increasing the code we are actually
 
00:42:49.870 --> 00:42:49.880 align:start position:0%
costing everyone who's paying into
 
00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:52.079 align:start position:0%
additional transmission lines because we
 
00:42:53.870 --> 00:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
need more electricity to heat and cool
 
00:42:55.750 --> 00:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
our buildings and unfortunately we're
 
00:42:57.630 --> 00:42:57.640 align:start position:0%
not re requiring commissioning so that
 
00:42:59.829 --> 00:42:59.839 align:start position:0%
could be the natural outgrowth is a
 
00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:01.680 align:start position:0%
facility that does not perform at the
 
00:43:03.230 --> 00:43:03.240 align:start position:0%
level that it could because we haven't
 
00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.200 align:start position:0%
Baseline required that it meet the
 
00:43:07.549 --> 00:43:07.559 align:start position:0%
commissioning requirements so yes of
 
00:43:08.910 --> 00:43:08.920 align:start position:0%
course we can always have someone
 
00:43:10.549 --> 00:43:10.559 align:start position:0%
independently spend their money and do
 
00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:13.160 align:start position:0%
more and often commercial clients do but
 
00:43:14.710 --> 00:43:14.720 align:start position:0%
I would argue that there is a greater
 
00:43:16.309 --> 00:43:16.319 align:start position:0%
good and there's a greater cost on all
 
00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:18.480 align:start position:0%
of us if we don't make that the Baseline
 
00:43:21.790 --> 00:43:21.800 align:start position:0%
all right thank you representative Manti
 
00:43:24.069 --> 00:43:24.079 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr s thank you representative
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
for taking my question so if we are just
 
00:43:31.430 --> 00:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
adopting the 2021 code to bring it up
 
00:43:34.309 --> 00:43:34.319 align:start position:0%
where are we right now for the clean um
 
00:43:37.950 --> 00:43:37.960 align:start position:0%
energy code in terms of what year cycle
 
00:43:40.470 --> 00:43:40.480 align:start position:0%
are we in thank you for the question um
 
00:43:42.430 --> 00:43:42.440 align:start position:0%
right now we're using the 2018 codes
 
00:43:44.549 --> 00:43:44.559 align:start position:0%
across the board which includes the 2018
 
00:43:46.829 --> 00:43:46.839 align:start position:0%
energy code but I would note that we
 
00:43:50.510 --> 00:43:50.520 align:start position:0%
have um made an amendment to remove the
 
00:43:52.190 --> 00:43:52.200 align:start position:0%
commissioning requirement for commercial
 
00:43:54.510 --> 00:43:54.520 align:start position:0%
facilities in the 2018 energy code right
 
00:43:57.030 --> 00:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
now so bringing that forward which is
 
00:43:59.190 --> 00:43:59.200 align:start position:0%
what this amendment does still does not
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
Target the root of the cost when it's
 
00:44:03.390 --> 00:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
spread across everyone who participates
 
00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:06.720 align:start position:0%
in the market thank you representative
 
00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
grto thank you so representative MC
 
00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:10.720 align:start position:0%
Williams what you're suggesting is that
 
00:44:14.270 --> 00:44:14.280 align:start position:0%
we address commercial facilities rather
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
than the because the energy code right
 
00:44:19.870 --> 00:44:19.880 align:start position:0%
now applies to everything uh great
 
00:44:21.870 --> 00:44:21.880 align:start position:0%
question thank you um the energy code
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
has both residential and Commercial
 
00:44:25.549 --> 00:44:25.559 align:start position:0%
piece to it and you will hear plenty of
 
00:44:27.270 --> 00:44:27.280 align:start position:0%
people testify after me on the
 
00:44:30.069 --> 00:44:30.079 align:start position:0%
residential side uh we have we have
 
00:44:32.950 --> 00:44:32.960 align:start position:0%
severely limited the base energy code in
 
00:44:35.069 --> 00:44:35.079 align:start position:0%
2018 because of the concerns about
 
00:44:37.230 --> 00:44:37.240 align:start position:0%
residential energy performance and I
 
00:44:38.470 --> 00:44:38.480 align:start position:0%
don't believe that that really is a
 
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
debate that we're going to be having on
 
00:44:42.270 --> 00:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
this bill today certainly over the next
 
00:44:44.390 --> 00:44:44.400 align:start position:0%
three years as we look at the 2024 codes
 
00:44:46.710 --> 00:44:46.720 align:start position:0%
this will be a Coming Attractions issue
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
but right now I would say the focus is
 
00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
on Commercial thank
 
00:44:53.150 --> 00:44:53.160 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
00:44:55.630 --> 00:44:55.640 align:start position:0%
questions see oh yes representative man
 
00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:56.510 align:start position:0%
questions see oh yes representative man
py

00:44:56.510 --> 00:44:56.520 align:start position:0%
py
 
00:45:00.030 --> 00:45:00.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair so in terms of growth
 
00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:02.680 align:start position:0%
you know we know housing large complexes
 
00:45:06.589 --> 00:45:06.599 align:start position:0%
are necessary and the code can influence
 
00:45:10.109 --> 00:45:10.119 align:start position:0%
the new constructions and stuff
 
00:45:12.750 --> 00:45:12.760 align:start position:0%
similarly on the commercial side do you
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
see a huge growth in our state with new
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
facilities new
 
00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:21.920 align:start position:0%
commercial um buildings coming
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
up um so you're asking me to put on my
 
00:45:26.349 --> 00:45:26.359 align:start position:0%
hat be nosto Damas and say in the next
 
00:45:29.349 --> 00:45:29.359 align:start position:0%
10 years what do we
 
00:45:32.710 --> 00:45:32.720 align:start position:0%
expect no if I can cut it down to say
 
00:45:34.670 --> 00:45:34.680 align:start position:0%
housing is a critical stuff and you sit
 
00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:37.680 align:start position:0%
on that special commission too and with
 
00:45:41.109 --> 00:45:41.119 align:start position:0%
that huge buildings coming up that is a
 
00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:45.480 align:start position:0%
necessity need in the state with this
 
00:45:48.270 --> 00:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
because it's a commercial scale for
 
00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:49.349 align:start position:0%
because it's a commercial scale for
building

00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:49.359 align:start position:0%
building
 
00:45:52.230 --> 00:45:52.240 align:start position:0%
codes would that
 
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
impact any housing large housing
 
00:45:57.990 --> 00:45:58.000 align:start position:0%
complexes or or just commercial thank
 
00:46:01.150 --> 00:46:01.160 align:start position:0%
you for clarifying yes um multi-unit
 
00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880 align:start position:0%
housing would fall under commercial
 
00:46:06.150 --> 00:46:06.160 align:start position:0%
that's correct um and just to clarify
 
00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:07.720 align:start position:0%
the record I actually sit on the special
 
00:46:09.390 --> 00:46:09.400 align:start position:0%
committee for child care but I am
 
00:46:11.390 --> 00:46:11.400 align:start position:0%
presenting several bills to the special
 
00:46:13.829 --> 00:46:13.839 align:start position:0%
committee on housing so I'm all over the
 
00:46:16.510 --> 00:46:16.520 align:start position:0%
state house uh but big picture I think
 
00:46:18.910 --> 00:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
what our what our concern is here is
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
that um our commercial facilities want
 
00:46:23.990 --> 00:46:24.000 align:start position:0%
to know they're coming to a state that's
 
00:46:26.230 --> 00:46:26.240 align:start position:0%
going to have consistency and during our
 
00:46:28.030 --> 00:46:28.040 align:start position:0%
last hearing we talked about how
 
00:46:29.630 --> 00:46:29.640 align:start position:0%
frequently New Hampshire updates their
 
00:46:32.670 --> 00:46:32.680 align:start position:0%
code and expecting okay in January of
 
00:46:34.390 --> 00:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
every 3 years we're going to have an
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
update so coming up with that
 
00:46:38.910 --> 00:46:38.920 align:start position:0%
consistency is important and also making
 
00:46:41.270 --> 00:46:41.280 align:start position:0%
sure they know the rules so that when
 
00:46:42.670 --> 00:46:42.680 align:start position:0%
they're playing the game and building a
 
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
facility they know these are the things
 
00:46:45.670 --> 00:46:45.680 align:start position:0%
we need to do to meet New Hampshire's
 
00:46:48.510 --> 00:46:48.520 align:start position:0%
code requirements um totally sideline
 
00:46:49.829 --> 00:46:49.839 align:start position:0%
but also something that commercial
 
00:46:51.230 --> 00:46:51.240 align:start position:0%
facilities are really struggling with in
 
00:46:52.589 --> 00:46:52.599 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire and this committee should
 
00:46:54.549 --> 00:46:54.559 align:start position:0%
know about this um the ability to
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
interconnect if you're waiting for your
 
00:46:58.630 --> 00:46:58.640 align:start position:0%
solar panels to get connected as a large
 
00:47:01.710 --> 00:47:01.720 align:start position:0%
facility it can take up to 2 years to
 
00:47:03.309 --> 00:47:03.319 align:start position:0%
get approval from the utility and that
 
00:47:05.150 --> 00:47:05.160 align:start position:0%
is just terrible because as someone
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
who's spending millions of dollars to
 
00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
build a facility and then millions of
 
00:47:11.950 --> 00:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
dollars to run it and then of course
 
00:47:13.829 --> 00:47:13.839 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands of dollars for the
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
electricity having to wait on the
 
00:47:17.150 --> 00:47:17.160 align:start position:0%
connection and not being able to net
 
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
meter during that time I think is just
 
00:47:20.829 --> 00:47:20.839 align:start position:0%
terrible so that's personal but I think
 
00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:22.040 align:start position:0%
that there are some things that we can
 
00:47:23.589 --> 00:47:23.599 align:start position:0%
do as a legislature to remove
 
00:47:25.829 --> 00:47:25.839 align:start position:0%
impediments to commercial facilities
 
00:47:27.630 --> 00:47:27.640 align:start position:0%
seeding in our state thank
 
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:31.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:34.150 --> 00:47:34.160 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman so are
 
00:47:36.309 --> 00:47:36.319 align:start position:0%
these two bills going to
 
00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:47.549 --> 00:47:47.559 align:start position:0%
probably thank you very much for your
 
00:47:48.990 --> 00:47:49.000 align:start position:0%
time thank
 
00:47:54.710 --> 00:47:54.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:54.720 --> 00:48:02.430 align:start position:0%
 
Sherman

00:48:02.430 --> 00:48:02.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:04.349 --> 00:48:04.359 align:start position:0%
Mr chair members of the committee thank
 
00:48:07.750 --> 00:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
you again um we're talking only about
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
the amendment at this point correct no
 
00:48:11.589 --> 00:48:11.599 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the bill the bill
 
00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
okay again for the record my name is
 
00:48:15.069 --> 00:48:15.079 align:start position:0%
Philip Sherman I'm the chair of the
 
00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:16.720 align:start position:0%
building code review board and I speak
 
00:48:19.750 --> 00:48:19.760 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill this bill proposes
 
00:48:22.270 --> 00:48:22.280 align:start position:0%
to update seven of the eight model codes
 
00:48:24.150 --> 00:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
included in the State Building Code the
 
00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
National Electric Code is published on a
 
00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
different schedule and we'll be back to
 
00:48:30.630 --> 00:48:30.640 align:start position:0%
you next year with that six of the seven
 
00:48:32.470 --> 00:48:32.480 align:start position:0%
codes published by the International
 
00:48:34.589 --> 00:48:34.599 align:start position:0%
Code Council are proposed to be updated
 
00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:37.640 align:start position:0%
to the 2021 Edition with the seventh as
 
00:48:40.109 --> 00:48:40.119 align:start position:0%
previously said the international energy
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
conservation code being left on the
 
00:48:45.870 --> 00:48:45.880 align:start position:0%
current 2018 Edition the board through
 
00:48:47.910 --> 00:48:47.920 align:start position:0%
various committees reviewed each code
 
00:48:50.030 --> 00:48:50.040 align:start position:0%
assessed the relative cost impact to the
 
00:48:52.030 --> 00:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
significant changes and voted on each
 
00:48:54.309 --> 00:48:54.319 align:start position:0%
code individually there was little
 
00:48:56.910 --> 00:48:56.920 align:start position:0%
disagreement on the six codes other than
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
energy to move forward the energy code
 
00:49:01.870 --> 00:49:01.880 align:start position:0%
underwent extensive discussions
 
00:49:04.750 --> 00:49:04.760 align:start position:0%
including the bcrb committee members of
 
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.000 align:start position:0%
interested parties and I must say that
 
00:49:09.950 --> 00:49:09.960 align:start position:0%
those committee meetings were wide open
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
um non-committee members were sitting at
 
00:49:13.750 --> 00:49:13.760 align:start position:0%
the table and welcome to speak on
 
00:49:16.549 --> 00:49:16.559 align:start position:0%
everything and did uh we had a the
 
00:49:18.430 --> 00:49:18.440 align:start position:0%
Normal public hearing where a lot of it
 
00:49:20.390 --> 00:49:20.400 align:start position:0%
was brought up again and then the full
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
board where the vote was nine in favor
 
00:49:24.990 --> 00:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
of retaining the 2018 code and four
 
00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:26.030 align:start position:0%
of retaining the 2018 code and four
against

00:49:26.030 --> 00:49:26.040 align:start position:0%
against
 
00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:28.040 align:start position:0%
uh so it was a split vote but not all
 
00:49:31.069 --> 00:49:31.079 align:start position:0%
that close uh presumably the people
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
voting against prefer the 2021 code but
 
00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:35.030 align:start position:0%
voting against prefer the 2021 code but
not

00:49:35.030 --> 00:49:35.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily that was not a recorded
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
thing uh the bill also proposes
 
00:49:42.230 --> 00:49:42.240 align:start position:0%
ratifying the various amendments
 
00:49:45.069 --> 00:49:45.079 align:start position:0%
approved by the board we have 79
 
00:49:47.270 --> 00:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
amendments to the six model codes
 
00:49:50.750 --> 00:49:50.760 align:start position:0%
involved the six go into the 2021 most
 
00:49:52.630 --> 00:49:52.640 align:start position:0%
are carried forward from the current
 
00:49:54.950 --> 00:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
codes however 15 of these are new
 
00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.109 align:start position:0%
codes however 15 of these are new
amendments

00:49:56.109 --> 00:49:56.119 align:start position:0%
amendments
 
00:49:58.589 --> 00:49:58.599 align:start position:0%
the new amendments involve accessibility
 
00:50:00.910 --> 00:50:00.920 align:start position:0%
involving aligning the building code
 
00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:02.680 align:start position:0%
with existing requirements of the
 
00:50:05.190 --> 00:50:05.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities commission dealing with
 
00:50:07.349 --> 00:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
recovery homes which is a newer issue
 
00:50:09.789 --> 00:50:09.799 align:start position:0%
that's come up uh in the state
 
00:50:12.069 --> 00:50:12.079 align:start position:0%
eliminating sprinkler requirements in
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
existing three and four unit residential
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
buildings we work with members of the
 
00:50:19.549 --> 00:50:19.559 align:start position:0%
legislature and interested groups on
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
that accessibility certifications as I
 
00:50:24.390 --> 00:50:24.400 align:start position:0%
mentioned previously under under the
 
00:50:27.430 --> 00:50:27.440 align:start position:0%
other bill testing of plastic Plumbing
 
00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
piping say that three times fast uh
 
00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:33.240 align:start position:0%
building sewer definition and that was
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
uh our grease trap exercise two years
 
00:50:37.870 --> 00:50:37.880 align:start position:0%
ago we missed one Amendment there so it
 
00:50:40.510 --> 00:50:40.520 align:start position:0%
was to bring us into compliance or or
 
00:50:43.950 --> 00:50:43.960 align:start position:0%
conformance with what the dees required
 
00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:46.280 align:start position:0%
and again aligning the residential code
 
00:50:49.670 --> 00:50:49.680 align:start position:0%
energy requirements with the other model
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
codes I'll speak if I may uh to the to
 
00:50:54.870 --> 00:50:54.880 align:start position:0%
the potential amendment to this bill
 
00:50:57.190 --> 00:50:57.200 align:start position:0%
which would require the use of the 2021
 
00:51:00.990 --> 00:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
energy code first what is most important
 
00:51:03.870 --> 00:51:03.880 align:start position:0%
in my opinion to remember is that many
 
00:51:06.230 --> 00:51:06.240 align:start position:0%
having much larger shoes than I have
 
00:51:08.710 --> 00:51:08.720 align:start position:0%
spent the last 20 years creating and
 
00:51:10.950 --> 00:51:10.960 align:start position:0%
updating the code adoption process in
 
00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:13.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I plead with both sides of
 
00:51:16.510 --> 00:51:16.520 align:start position:0%
the discussion to not collapse this
 
00:51:18.950 --> 00:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
process while we talk about which code
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
we should
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
adopt secondly the bcrb has approved 10
 
00:51:26.390 --> 00:51:26.400 align:start position:0%
contingent amendments that's my term to
 
00:51:28.789 --> 00:51:28.799 align:start position:0%
the 2021 energy code which would only
 
00:51:30.390 --> 00:51:30.400 align:start position:0%
come into effect if the bill is
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
successfully amended representative
 
00:51:35.349 --> 00:51:35.359 align:start position:0%
McWilliams alluded to that each of these
 
00:51:37.309 --> 00:51:37.319 align:start position:0%
amendments is simply carried over from
 
00:51:40.270 --> 00:51:40.280 align:start position:0%
the current 2018 code no changes or a
 
00:51:41.950 --> 00:51:41.960 align:start position:0%
couple section numbers that moved around
 
00:51:44.990 --> 00:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the model code if an amendment to go
 
00:51:47.630 --> 00:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
to the 2021 energy code passes but
 
00:51:49.230 --> 00:51:49.240 align:start position:0%
there's disagreement on some of the
 
00:51:51.710 --> 00:51:51.720 align:start position:0%
Amendments commissioning was brought up
 
00:51:53.309 --> 00:51:53.319 align:start position:0%
we'd ask that you hold things for a
 
00:51:55.030 --> 00:51:55.040 align:start position:0%
couple of months giving us time to
 
00:51:56.270 --> 00:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
approve approve or retract the
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
amendments where disagreement exists and
 
00:52:01.710 --> 00:52:01.720 align:start position:0%
come back to you with a new date for
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
ratification this will prevent writing
 
00:52:06.990 --> 00:52:07.000 align:start position:0%
the specifics of amendments into state
 
00:52:10.270 --> 00:52:10.280 align:start position:0%
law therefore at this time we request
 
00:52:13.390 --> 00:52:13.400 align:start position:0%
the bcrb ratification date be changed to
 
00:52:15.950 --> 00:52:15.960 align:start position:0%
January 12 2024 as mentioned by
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire which is the
 
00:52:19.430 --> 00:52:19.440 align:start position:0%
latest date that amendments were
 
00:52:22.589 --> 00:52:22.599 align:start position:0%
approved by the bcrb if necessary this
 
00:52:25.349 --> 00:52:25.359 align:start position:0%
can be easily modified again Downstream
 
00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:26.319 align:start position:0%
as we've
 
00:52:29.309 --> 00:52:29.319 align:start position:0%
discussed lastly this bill proposes to
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
delete the last sentence in RSA 155 A1
 
00:52:35.630 --> 00:52:35.640 align:start position:0%
Roman numeral 4 this sentence is a
 
00:52:38.349 --> 00:52:38.359 align:start position:0%
Prohibition on adopting other National
 
00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
or model codes and the deletion is
 
00:52:43.270 --> 00:52:43.280 align:start position:0%
proposed as some of the necessary
 
00:52:45.430 --> 00:52:45.440 align:start position:0%
reference standards are referred to by
 
00:52:48.309 --> 00:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
their publisher as codes it's just
 
00:52:50.470 --> 00:52:50.480 align:start position:0%
sloppy housekeeping on some people's
 
00:52:52.990 --> 00:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
part the original intent of this
 
00:52:55.589 --> 00:52:55.599 align:start position:0%
prohibition is I understand it was
 
00:52:57.950 --> 00:52:57.960 align:start position:0%
generally to prevent the adoption of a
 
00:52:59.789 --> 00:52:59.799 align:start position:0%
Statewide housing or property
 
00:53:02.309 --> 00:53:02.319 align:start position:0%
maintenance code basically to prohibit
 
00:53:05.910 --> 00:53:05.920 align:start position:0%
us from from adopting that U that type
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
of a code given the current ratification
 
00:53:10.950 --> 00:53:10.960 align:start position:0%
process which includes the advisory
 
00:53:13.549 --> 00:53:13.559 align:start position:0%
committee remember nothing at all that
 
00:53:15.670 --> 00:53:15.680 align:start position:0%
we do comes into effect until the
 
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
general court ratifies the change so
 
00:53:20.309 --> 00:53:20.319 align:start position:0%
there's absolutely no risk that we can
 
00:53:22.549 --> 00:53:22.559 align:start position:0%
do something without the you know the
 
00:53:25.349 --> 00:53:25.359 align:start position:0%
the approval of the general court um so
 
00:53:27.069 --> 00:53:27.079 align:start position:0%
we prefer to just take that sentence out
 
00:53:28.349 --> 00:53:28.359 align:start position:0%
of there because I don't think it's
 
00:53:31.190 --> 00:53:31.200 align:start position:0%
needed anymore and there is a an
 
00:53:33.109 --> 00:53:33.119 align:start position:0%
argument out at the margins that we
 
00:53:35.190 --> 00:53:35.200 align:start position:0%
could not adopt things like the fire
 
00:53:38.589 --> 00:53:38.599 align:start position:0%
alarm standard which is titled a code
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
which is necessary for us to have as
 
00:53:42.950 --> 00:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
part of the building code so I'm happy
 
00:53:45.309 --> 00:53:45.319 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you very
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:52.589 --> 00:53:52.599 align:start position:0%
Schmidt thank you Mr chairman so uh
 
00:53:55.470 --> 00:53:55.480 align:start position:0%
chair Sherman uh so you you heard my
 
00:53:57.069 --> 00:53:57.079 align:start position:0%
question with regard to whether this is
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
going to a subcommittee as it usually
 
00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:00.960 align:start position:0%
does and you heard the chair's response
 
00:54:03.430 --> 00:54:03.440 align:start position:0%
that it probably will be going to a
 
00:54:07.670 --> 00:54:07.680 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so the the the fine-tuning
 
00:54:09.390 --> 00:54:09.400 align:start position:0%
at the edges that you're already
 
00:54:12.589 --> 00:54:12.599 align:start position:0%
starting in on is something that that
 
00:54:16.630 --> 00:54:16.640 align:start position:0%
undoubtedly will will be worked through
 
00:54:18.510 --> 00:54:18.520 align:start position:0%
uh in the subcommittee do you have
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
colleagues who are not here today who
 
00:54:24.150 --> 00:54:24.160 align:start position:0%
would be helpful in in in uh helping us
 
00:54:26.670 --> 00:54:26.680 align:start position:0%
to get to the right result that could be
 
00:54:28.789 --> 00:54:28.799 align:start position:0%
there for the subcommittee as well as
 
00:54:31.150 --> 00:54:31.160 align:start position:0%
yourself I know you'll be there yes
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
representative Maguire is aware that I'm
 
00:54:34.870 --> 00:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
going to be overseas during the month of
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
March uh but we certainly have other
 
00:54:40.030 --> 00:54:40.040 align:start position:0%
people and I also wanted to apologize uh
 
00:54:41.990 --> 00:54:42.000 align:start position:0%
I was asked to apologize on behalf of
 
00:54:44.030 --> 00:54:44.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire building officials
 
00:54:46.430 --> 00:54:46.440 align:start position:0%
Association uh the texts went something
 
00:54:49.789 --> 00:54:49.799 align:start position:0%
along the work the line of it's it's bad
 
00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:51.760 align:start position:0%
when our full-time job gets in the way
 
00:54:54.109 --> 00:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
of our volunteer work uh but
 
00:54:55.829 --> 00:54:55.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately the two two people in that
 
00:54:58.030 --> 00:54:58.040 align:start position:0%
organization are both bogged down with
 
00:55:00.030 --> 00:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
with day jobs today and we're not able
 
00:55:03.829 --> 00:55:03.839 align:start position:0%
to be here just as an a side yes
 
00:55:08.069 --> 00:55:08.079 align:start position:0%
representative GTO thank you Mr Sherman
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
during your testimony you mentioned that
 
00:55:14.270 --> 00:55:14.280 align:start position:0%
there were some differences of opinion
 
00:55:16.870 --> 00:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
concerning the energy code within your
 
00:55:19.230 --> 00:55:19.240 align:start position:0%
building review code board and I'm
 
00:55:21.589 --> 00:55:21.599 align:start position:0%
wondering did you address solely the
 
00:55:23.670 --> 00:55:23.680 align:start position:0%
commercial aspect of the code or did you
 
00:55:25.750 --> 00:55:25.760 align:start position:0%
look at it as a whole because
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
what representative MC Williams is
 
00:55:29.430 --> 00:55:29.440 align:start position:0%
recommending is that we only address it
 
00:55:31.670 --> 00:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
on a commercial
 
00:55:35.349 --> 00:55:35.359 align:start position:0%
basis certainly both parts were reviewed
 
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
and both parts were discussed a fair
 
00:55:40.510 --> 00:55:40.520 align:start position:0%
amount of the discussion involved
 
00:55:43.549 --> 00:55:43.559 align:start position:0%
residential so we need to remember that
 
00:55:46.069 --> 00:55:46.079 align:start position:0%
um the com the international energy
 
00:55:47.990 --> 00:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
conservation code really is two
 
00:55:50.549 --> 00:55:50.559 align:start position:0%
completely separate codes in one book
 
00:55:53.069 --> 00:55:53.079 align:start position:0%
one applies to commercial one applies to
 
00:55:56.190 --> 00:55:56.200 align:start position:0%
residential however that residential
 
00:55:58.270 --> 00:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
application takes us up through three-
 
00:56:00.430 --> 00:56:00.440 align:start position:0%
story call them apartment buildings so
 
00:56:03.430 --> 00:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
three story commercial buildings at four
 
00:56:06.549 --> 00:56:06.559 align:start position:0%
stories your commercial in addition New
 
00:56:09.069 --> 00:56:09.079 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has extended those residential
 
00:56:11.470 --> 00:56:11.480 align:start position:0%
Provisions to what I'll call smaller
 
00:56:14.230 --> 00:56:14.240 align:start position:0%
buildings of other groups um and I don't
 
00:56:16.349 --> 00:56:16.359 align:start position:0%
have the the uh numbers right in front
 
00:56:18.670 --> 00:56:18.680 align:start position:0%
of me but it's the same three-story and
 
00:56:21.150 --> 00:56:21.160 align:start position:0%
there's a square footage limit where an
 
00:56:23.549 --> 00:56:23.559 align:start position:0%
office building a grocery store whatever
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
could be built to those residential
 
00:56:27.349 --> 00:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
standards that's been in the codee now
 
00:56:29.390 --> 00:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
for several
 
00:56:31.390 --> 00:56:31.400 align:start position:0%
additions thank
 
00:56:34.109 --> 00:56:34.119 align:start position:0%
you representative Brown uh thank you Mr
 
00:56:36.270 --> 00:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
chair thanks for taking my question did
 
00:56:38.150 --> 00:56:38.160 align:start position:0%
you were going pretty quick did did you
 
00:56:39.789 --> 00:56:39.799 align:start position:0%
say something to the effect that this
 
00:56:43.270 --> 00:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
could be um uh that if we go with the
 
00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:46.280 align:start position:0%
energy standards it could be more costly
 
00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:52.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
buildings there there seems to to be
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
General agreement and I'm always
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
cautious trying to put words in other
 
00:57:03.589 --> 00:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
people's mouths that The Upfront costs
 
00:57:06.430 --> 00:57:06.440 align:start position:0%
of the new energy code are an
 
00:57:08.789 --> 00:57:08.799 align:start position:0%
increase there's differences of opinion
 
00:57:14.710 --> 00:57:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:17.190 --> 00:57:17.200 align:start position:0%
be there seems to be an understanding on
 
00:57:19.470 --> 00:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
the part of at least some people that
 
00:57:22.349 --> 00:57:22.359 align:start position:0%
that increas is offset over time of
 
00:57:23.950 --> 00:57:23.960 align:start position:0%
course you only get an offset over time
 
00:57:25.390 --> 00:57:25.400 align:start position:0%
if you build a building
 
00:57:27.270 --> 00:57:27.280 align:start position:0%
so this does tie into the whole
 
00:57:32.670 --> 00:57:32.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:35.589 --> 00:57:35.599 align:start position:0%
discussions representative meny thank
 
00:57:37.470 --> 00:57:37.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you for taking my
 
00:57:41.150 --> 00:57:41.160 align:start position:0%
question um in terms of the code that
 
00:57:42.789 --> 00:57:42.799 align:start position:0%
currently is in the books are being
 
00:57:44.230 --> 00:57:44.240 align:start position:0%
followed is
 
00:57:48.710 --> 00:57:48.720 align:start position:0%
2018 we are trying to adopt the
 
00:57:51.789 --> 00:57:51.799 align:start position:0%
2021 uh to catch up for the threeyear
 
00:57:57.829 --> 00:57:57.839 align:start position:0%
cycle so my question is between 2018 and
 
00:58:03.069 --> 00:58:03.079 align:start position:0%
2021 we experienced a world pandemic did
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
that have an impact on our building
 
00:58:12.789 --> 00:58:12.799 align:start position:0%
Quality Air energy all
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
those in terms of that came right smack
 
00:58:19.270 --> 00:58:19.280 align:start position:0%
dag in the middle of 2021 the code that
 
00:58:23.950 --> 00:58:23.960 align:start position:0%
we adopt would that get to us to that
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
higher level that we need it thank you
 
00:58:30.510 --> 00:58:30.520 align:start position:0%
for your question uh I'm going to get
 
00:58:32.349 --> 00:58:32.359 align:start position:0%
the dates wrong so perhaps the Fire
 
00:58:34.670 --> 00:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
Marshall could help keep me honest here
 
00:58:37.990 --> 00:58:38.000 align:start position:0%
the 2018 code was not adopted until a
 
00:58:40.870 --> 00:58:40.880 align:start position:0%
year and a half or so ago two years ago
 
00:58:42.789 --> 00:58:42.799 align:start position:0%
so that the 2018 is the date of the
 
00:58:45.950 --> 00:58:45.960 align:start position:0%
model code but New Hampshire adopted it
 
00:58:50.549 --> 00:58:50.559 align:start position:0%
here a couple of years ago um the 2021
 
00:58:52.510 --> 00:58:52.520 align:start position:0%
code was heavily
 
00:58:55.549 --> 00:58:55.559 align:start position:0%
written prior to and through through
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
through co uh but it was published in
 
00:59:01.670 --> 00:59:01.680 align:start position:0%
2020 so it was
 
00:59:04.510 --> 00:59:04.520 align:start position:0%
fundamentally solidified before the
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
virus started the co episode um that's
 
00:59:11.510 --> 00:59:11.520 align:start position:0%
the general sequence I probably got some
 
00:59:14.589 --> 00:59:14.599 align:start position:0%
of the dates wrong in
 
00:59:16.870 --> 00:59:16.880 align:start position:0%
there any other
 
00:59:19.950 --> 00:59:19.960 align:start position:0%
questions um I just have one if we don't
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
adopt the 2021 codes this year when are
 
00:59:25.470 --> 00:59:25.480 align:start position:0%
they up for review again when would they
 
00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.950 align:start position:0%
they up for review again when would they
be

00:59:27.950 --> 00:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:30.150 align:start position:0%
 
reconsidered

00:59:30.150 --> 00:59:30.160 align:start position:0%
reconsidered
 
00:59:32.670 --> 00:59:32.680 align:start position:0%
certainly the board would be permitted
 
00:59:36.470 --> 00:59:36.480 align:start position:0%
to look at it again each year it's we're
 
00:59:38.510 --> 00:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
sort of try to stay in sync with the
 
00:59:40.190 --> 00:59:40.200 align:start position:0%
legislative cycle for
 
00:59:43.230 --> 00:59:43.240 align:start position:0%
ratification um I don't know as there
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
would be a lot of incentive to do
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
anything until the next three-year cycle
 
00:59:51.390 --> 00:59:51.400 align:start position:0%
comes up but again that's not statutory
 
00:59:54.190 --> 00:59:54.200 align:start position:0%
and the board would make up its own mind
 
00:59:54.200 --> 00:59:55.470 align:start position:0%
and the board would make up its own mind
presumably

00:59:55.470 --> 00:59:55.480 align:start position:0%
presumably
 
00:59:57.510 --> 00:59:57.520 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much appreciate
 
01:00:03.029 --> 01:00:03.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
you um Katherine
 
01:00:10.589 --> 01:00:10.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:16.480 --> 01:00:18.390 align:start position:0%
 
opposition

01:00:18.390 --> 01:00:18.400 align:start position:0%
opposition
 
01:00:22.150 --> 01:00:22.160 align:start position:0%
um good morning thank you for taking
 
01:00:25.270 --> 01:00:25.280 align:start position:0%
my testimony
 
01:00:33.589 --> 01:00:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:33.599 --> 01:00:36.390 align:start position:0%
 
my

01:00:36.390 --> 01:00:36.400 align:start position:0%
my
 
01:00:43.950 --> 01:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:46.829 --> 01:00:46.839 align:start position:0%
you thank you good morning my name is
 
01:00:49.670 --> 01:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
Katherine Corker I'm from New Hampshire
 
01:00:51.829 --> 01:00:51.839 align:start position:0%
Sierra Club it's great to be back in
 
01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
this committee and um we
 
01:01:00.630 --> 01:01:00.640 align:start position:0%
represent uh 177,000 people in the State
 
01:01:04.309 --> 01:01:04.319 align:start position:0%
uh members and supporters and our motto
 
01:01:07.990 --> 01:01:08.000 align:start position:0%
is to enjoy explore and
 
01:01:14.270 --> 01:01:14.280 align:start position:0%
protect and um we officially
 
01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
um do not oppose updating
 
01:01:21.870 --> 01:01:21.880 align:start position:0%
codes uh with this bill we just want to
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
update all the codes um and to include
 
01:01:29.670 --> 01:01:29.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:31.990 --> 01:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
Efficiency I have
 
01:01:37.589 --> 01:01:37.599 align:start position:0%
included a um a handout about the uh
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
cost savings associated with the energy
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
code updates um compared with the
 
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
Baseline which is the
 
01:01:50.510 --> 01:01:50.520 align:start position:0%
2015 uh
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
codes and um that has a
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
the long and the short of it is um that
 
01:02:03.950 --> 01:02:03.960 align:start position:0%
there are Energy savings for the
 
01:02:08.109 --> 01:02:08.119 align:start position:0%
occupants uh of over $500
 
01:02:10.309 --> 01:02:10.319 align:start position:0%
annually and and that's a pretty
 
01:02:14.190 --> 01:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
conservative amount um so I in my
 
01:02:17.670 --> 01:02:17.680 align:start position:0%
testimony I really want to emphasize the
 
01:02:22.750 --> 01:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
occupants here um that the operating
 
01:02:27.190 --> 01:02:27.200 align:start position:0%
cost of a home um is greatly improved
 
01:02:29.510 --> 01:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
with these Energy
 
01:02:31.510 --> 01:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
cost-saving building
 
01:02:36.630 --> 01:02:36.640 align:start position:0%
codes um and knowing that we
 
01:02:39.390 --> 01:02:39.400 align:start position:0%
are that the governor
 
01:02:42.029 --> 01:02:42.039 align:start position:0%
has approve in
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
2022 approved $100
 
01:02:47.789 --> 01:02:47.799 align:start position:0%
million to the invest New Hampshire
 
01:02:52.750 --> 01:02:52.760 align:start position:0%
housing fund we are at a point where
 
01:02:55.910 --> 01:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
everyone is really making an effort to
 
01:02:59.870 --> 01:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
address the housing issue and I I
 
01:03:05.109 --> 01:03:05.119 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um what I am nervous
 
01:03:07.829 --> 01:03:07.839 align:start position:0%
about is building houses that people
 
01:03:08.990 --> 01:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
can't live
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
in um and we haven't fixed the problem
 
01:03:19.630 --> 01:03:19.640 align:start position:0%
um the Energy Efficiency piece
 
01:03:23.190 --> 01:03:23.200 align:start position:0%
um when building a house may have
 
01:03:24.789 --> 01:03:24.799 align:start position:0%
upfront costs
 
01:03:27.309 --> 01:03:27.319 align:start position:0%
but if you don't do it you'll have
 
01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:31.359 align:start position:0%
monthly operating costs on top of your
 
01:03:36.190 --> 01:03:36.200 align:start position:0%
mortgage that will be a serious burden
 
01:03:40.150 --> 01:03:40.160 align:start position:0%
uh for loow income fixed income uh and
 
01:03:43.829 --> 01:03:43.839 align:start position:0%
the um skilled labor that we're trying
 
01:03:48.750 --> 01:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
to help uh get home so
 
01:03:53.269 --> 01:03:53.279 align:start position:0%
um it is it it really is a
 
01:03:57.109 --> 01:03:57.119 align:start position:0%
mistake to not address the operating
 
01:04:00.309 --> 01:04:00.319 align:start position:0%
cost of these homes
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
um so that was number two and then um
 
01:04:08.829 --> 01:04:08.839 align:start position:0%
where we
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:22.510 --> 01:04:22.520 align:start position:0%
um the energy codes if they're not right
 
01:04:25.430 --> 01:04:25.440 align:start position:0%
uh if the energy codes are not updated
 
01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:28.720 align:start position:0%
then folks will have a house that they
 
01:04:31.549 --> 01:04:31.559 align:start position:0%
will need to then
 
01:04:35.990 --> 01:04:36.000 align:start position:0%
retrofit and I my dad was a carpenter
 
01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:40.640 align:start position:0%
and he knew how to measure twice and cut
 
01:04:45.069 --> 01:04:45.079 align:start position:0%
once that here you're building homes
 
01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:48.680 align:start position:0%
that could be outdated and too expensive
 
01:04:52.630 --> 01:04:52.640 align:start position:0%
to live in and then too expensive to
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
retrofit this
 
01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
we have we deserve a high quality of
 
01:05:03.950 --> 01:05:03.960 align:start position:0%
housing in our state and we deserve
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
these updated energy codes so thank you
 
01:05:10.670 --> 01:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
um and that is my
 
01:05:12.870 --> 01:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
testimony great will you take questions
 
01:05:15.029 --> 01:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
sure any questions yes representative
 
01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:18.720 align:start position:0%
Men py Thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:05:19.990 --> 01:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.710 align:start position:0%
taking my
question

01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:05:25.430 --> 01:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
um from your
 
01:05:28.670 --> 01:05:28.680 align:start position:0%
testimony help me understand if I'm
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
understanding it correctly that adopting
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
the new energy code would enhance the
 
01:05:39.829 --> 01:05:39.839 align:start position:0%
quality and clean energy requirement for
 
01:05:42.950 --> 01:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
the commercial which is multif family
 
01:05:44.789 --> 01:05:44.799 align:start position:0%
homes will also
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
provide the occupants of a much
 
01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:50.589 align:start position:0%
provide the occupants of a much
better

01:05:50.589 --> 01:05:50.599 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:05:53.109 --> 01:05:53.119 align:start position:0%
environment in terms of energy as well
 
01:05:56.910 --> 01:05:56.920 align:start position:0%
as clean air is it correct um I I am
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
more focused on the residential side
 
01:06:03.109 --> 01:06:03.119 align:start position:0%
honestly and I um and so the commercial
 
01:06:06.190 --> 01:06:06.200 align:start position:0%
question I would uh leave to
 
01:06:09.549 --> 01:06:09.559 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams um but
 
01:06:12.990 --> 01:06:13.000 align:start position:0%
certainly With the Energy Efficiency
 
01:06:17.670 --> 01:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
measures in the building codes it does
 
01:06:20.349 --> 01:06:20.359 align:start position:0%
you know seal your house more
 
01:06:24.630 --> 01:06:24.640 align:start position:0%
completely um and provide um
 
01:06:28.069 --> 01:06:28.079 align:start position:0%
the house to breathe um not to like
 
01:06:31.710 --> 01:06:31.720 align:start position:0%
totally um cut it off as an envelope but
 
01:06:35.870 --> 01:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
um to allow for filters um to put be
 
01:06:39.430 --> 01:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
built into your home um and also
 
01:06:43.309 --> 01:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
thinking about Heating and Cooling there
 
01:06:46.829 --> 01:06:46.839 align:start position:0%
is um a really important piece with that
 
01:06:50.870 --> 01:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
as well uh so having that built in
 
01:06:54.069 --> 01:06:54.079 align:start position:0%
rather than retrofitted later is
 
01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
definitely way more
 
01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:00.559 align:start position:0%
affordable uh doing it from when you
 
01:07:04.309 --> 01:07:04.319 align:start position:0%
build the the home a followup yeah
 
01:07:07.269 --> 01:07:07.279 align:start position:0%
commercial meaning multif family homes
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about more than five
 
01:07:11.789 --> 01:07:11.799 align:start position:0%
10 story with
 
01:07:16.309 --> 01:07:16.319 align:start position:0%
150 uh having clarified that um and
 
01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:20.160 align:start position:0%
you're also addressing the need that
 
01:07:25.269 --> 01:07:25.279 align:start position:0%
happened between 2018 and 2020 one in
 
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:29.640 align:start position:0%
terms of pandemic era requirements that
 
01:07:32.470 --> 01:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
kind of brought to our attention correct
 
01:07:34.910 --> 01:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
for the buildings and for because most
 
01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:37.160 align:start position:0%
people lived in their homes right right
 
01:07:41.430 --> 01:07:41.440 align:start position:0%
so that would impact if we don't adopt
 
01:07:46.910 --> 01:07:46.920 align:start position:0%
it is that your concern I I think um the
 
01:07:51.510 --> 01:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
advances in Heating and Cooling are so
 
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
significant waiting three more years
 
01:07:56.390 --> 01:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
remember we're already three years
 
01:08:00.789 --> 01:08:00.799 align:start position:0%
behind waiting another three years would
 
01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
put New Hampshire well in the in the
 
01:08:08.710 --> 01:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
rear view mirror than than I think we
 
01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:11.549 align:start position:0%
rear view mirror than than I think we
should

01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:15.309 --> 01:08:15.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:18.749 --> 01:08:18.759 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you Mr chairman so you were
 
01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:21.880 align:start position:0%
indicated in your introduction that you
 
01:08:25.709 --> 01:08:25.719 align:start position:0%
you oppose the bill
 
01:08:28.309 --> 01:08:28.319 align:start position:0%
so sounds like you've got some issues
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
with the bill but you you're not really
 
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
in opposition or you think the bill is
 
01:08:36.269 --> 01:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
inadequate because it's in what way well
 
01:08:39.149 --> 01:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
um actually the amendment
 
01:08:42.669 --> 01:08:42.679 align:start position:0%
addresses the issue that I have um the
 
01:08:45.430 --> 01:08:45.440 align:start position:0%
amendment actually updates the Energy
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
Efficiency code so I didn't know that we
 
01:08:50.229 --> 01:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
were going to see an amendment we
 
01:08:52.669 --> 01:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
support the amendment thank you for
 
01:08:54.349 --> 01:08:54.359 align:start position:0%
asking about that I appre appreciate it
 
01:08:56.630 --> 01:08:56.640 align:start position:0%
follow up so uh the thing is you've
 
01:08:58.870 --> 01:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
heard this is going to a subcommittee so
 
01:09:01.189 --> 01:09:01.199 align:start position:0%
I caution my colleagues not to get into
 
01:09:03.829 --> 01:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
too many details needs to be worked out
 
01:09:07.349 --> 01:09:07.359 align:start position:0%
in the subcommittee not here so uh but
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
so you would be available for the sub
 
01:09:11.309 --> 01:09:11.319 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah absolutely thank you
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you for uh
 
01:09:16.349 --> 01:09:16.359 align:start position:0%
clarifying we do support the
 
01:09:19.669 --> 01:09:19.679 align:start position:0%
amendment representative Brown uh thank
 
01:09:21.749 --> 01:09:21.759 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair let me know if I get to off
 
01:09:23.950 --> 01:09:23.960 align:start position:0%
topic here or if you think it's in
 
01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:26.390 align:start position:0%
topic here or if you think it's in
appropriate

01:09:26.390 --> 01:09:26.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
01:09:30.110 --> 01:09:30.120 align:start position:0%
so I I guess in my mind I never would
 
01:09:32.390 --> 01:09:32.400 align:start position:0%
have Associated the Sierra Club with
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
homelessness and housing requirements
 
01:09:37.510 --> 01:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
that's what I'm I'm remembering for I
 
01:09:41.749 --> 01:09:41.759 align:start position:0%
think the Sierra Club is is there more
 
01:09:43.950 --> 01:09:43.960 align:start position:0%
concerns than you're stating here is
 
01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:45.400 align:start position:0%
there another concern that you're not
 
01:09:49.189 --> 01:09:49.199 align:start position:0%
stating here that the Sierra Club might
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
have historical interest in that even
 
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
makes any sense um
 
01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
maybe uh we support Energy
 
01:10:00.870 --> 01:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and and that is actually our
 
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:03.880 align:start position:0%
core value that we're trying and and
 
01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
trying to have access create access for
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
everyone to have Energy Efficiency
 
01:10:13.669 --> 01:10:13.679 align:start position:0%
measures perfect thank you
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
sure yes representative
 
01:10:19.149 --> 01:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
gold thank you Mr chair and thank you
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
for your
 
01:10:23.950 --> 01:10:23.960 align:start position:0%
question uh is it correct is my
 
01:10:25.550 --> 01:10:25.560 align:start position:0%
understanding correct that Energy
 
01:10:27.189 --> 01:10:27.199 align:start position:0%
Efficiency and the Sierra club's
 
01:10:30.229 --> 01:10:30.239 align:start position:0%
interest in it which may be similar to
 
01:10:32.709 --> 01:10:32.719 align:start position:0%
abanaki people with 13,000 years of
 
01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:36.320 align:start position:0%
stewardship of the planet uh is your
 
01:10:38.950 --> 01:10:38.960 align:start position:0%
interest uh regarding impact on the
 
01:10:41.430 --> 01:10:41.440 align:start position:0%
environment of energy and
 
01:10:44.070 --> 01:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
efficiency absolutely this is a clean
 
01:10:50.189 --> 01:10:50.199 align:start position:0%
air clean water issue uh that we should
 
01:10:55.550 --> 01:10:55.560 align:start position:0%
do more with less um that that uh Energy
 
01:10:58.310 --> 01:10:58.320 align:start position:0%
Efficiency uh I think
 
01:11:02.790 --> 01:11:02.800 align:start position:0%
is should be a a pretty basic value for
 
01:11:06.070 --> 01:11:06.080 align:start position:0%
everyone um I know we talk about
 
01:11:09.790 --> 01:11:09.800 align:start position:0%
streamlining in in the statute this is
 
01:11:12.669 --> 01:11:12.679 align:start position:0%
the same kind of thing if we could do if
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
if we could run our houses with less
 
01:11:18.510 --> 01:11:18.520 align:start position:0%
pollution and less energy and less cost
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:25.470 --> 01:11:25.480 align:start position:0%
win-win-win any other questions seeing
 
01:11:28.270 --> 01:11:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.149 --> 01:11:31.159 align:start position:0%
testimony Sean tumy Fire
 
01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:42.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:45.350 --> 01:11:45.360 align:start position:0%
Bell good morning my name is Sean Tumi
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
I'm the State Fire Marshal thank you for
 
01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
having me up here this morning um uh you
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
should have received a written uh letter
 
01:11:53.510 --> 01:11:53.520 align:start position:0%
from me in the portal uh it refer
 
01:11:55.590 --> 01:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
refences the advancement of the 21 codes
 
01:11:57.790 --> 01:11:57.800 align:start position:0%
with the exception of the 18 codes the
 
01:11:59.310 --> 01:11:59.320 align:start position:0%
department of safety supports the work
 
01:12:01.229 --> 01:12:01.239 align:start position:0%
of the building code review board uh and
 
01:12:02.870 --> 01:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
their work to advance the codes in New
 
01:12:05.390 --> 01:12:05.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we hearing the conversation
 
01:12:07.390 --> 01:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
this morning and the amendment we're
 
01:12:10.310 --> 01:12:10.320 align:start position:0%
also um open to conversations for the
 
01:12:12.270 --> 01:12:12.280 align:start position:0%
conversations to look at the 21 energy
 
01:12:13.990 --> 01:12:14.000 align:start position:0%
code Provisions with appropriate
 
01:12:15.990 --> 01:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
amendments so we're not locked into it
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
we just want to make sure the
 
01:12:18.790 --> 01:12:18.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate amendments kind of preserve
 
01:12:21.149 --> 01:12:21.159 align:start position:0%
the process so um there was some early
 
01:12:23.030 --> 01:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
conversations about the process in
 
01:12:25.189 --> 01:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
general the in the state over the last
 
01:12:28.310 --> 01:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
few years we've um through uh the work
 
01:12:29.510 --> 01:12:29.520 align:start position:0%
through the building cour review board
 
01:12:31.229 --> 01:12:31.239 align:start position:0%
the board of Fire Control and the
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
general court and many of the
 
01:12:36.669 --> 01:12:36.679 align:start position:0%
stakeholders I think we've we really uh
 
01:12:39.510 --> 01:12:39.520 align:start position:0%
informally formalized a plan to stay one
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
code cycle behind um it gives us time as
 
01:12:45.709 --> 01:12:45.719 align:start position:0%
we've heard to to to Really let other
 
01:12:47.790 --> 01:12:47.800 align:start position:0%
communities look at their codes and be
 
01:12:50.030 --> 01:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
the guinea pigs it gives our boards time
 
01:12:52.629 --> 01:12:52.639 align:start position:0%
to really properly vet the codes it
 
01:12:55.310 --> 01:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
gives our boards time to get stakeholder
 
01:12:58.550 --> 01:12:58.560 align:start position:0%
input uh it gives our boards time to get
 
01:13:00.629 --> 01:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
the information to the advisor the newly
 
01:13:02.350 --> 01:13:02.360 align:start position:0%
created advisory committee on C building
 
01:13:04.430 --> 01:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
of fire codes which is a legislative
 
01:13:07.510 --> 01:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
advisory committee and uh you know I
 
01:13:09.390 --> 01:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
think the important part is it it gives
 
01:13:10.790 --> 01:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
us the opportunity to really review
 
01:13:12.229 --> 01:13:12.239 align:start position:0%
things and make sure it's right for New
 
01:13:14.350 --> 01:13:14.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I think it's important to
 
01:13:17.870 --> 01:13:17.880 align:start position:0%
preserve that process uh if we have to
 
01:13:19.910 --> 01:13:19.920 align:start position:0%
change the language in the previous one
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
just a little bit the 2-year three-year
 
01:13:23.550 --> 01:13:23.560 align:start position:0%
thing I think that might be reasonable
 
01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:26.480 align:start position:0%
but it needs some cleanup um it sounds
 
01:13:28.030 --> 01:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
like we're heading to subcommittee happy
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
to be part of those conversations um but
 
01:13:33.390 --> 01:13:33.400 align:start position:0%
I think um moving the cords codes
 
01:13:35.870 --> 01:13:35.880 align:start position:0%
forward building and fire is important
 
01:13:37.669 --> 01:13:37.679 align:start position:0%
for our state IT addresses a lot of the
 
01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:40.080 align:start position:0%
newer technologies that are coming out
 
01:13:43.669 --> 01:13:43.679 align:start position:0%
um and it it provides for safer a safer
 
01:13:46.629 --> 01:13:46.639 align:start position:0%
built environment um I also recognize
 
01:13:48.470 --> 01:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
that there's a need to address
 
01:13:51.270 --> 01:13:51.280 align:start position:0%
amendments um that are necessary that we
 
01:13:53.629 --> 01:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
feel are necessary in New Hampshire
 
01:13:55.229 --> 01:13:55.239 align:start position:0%
based on our stakeholder input and we
 
01:13:56.629 --> 01:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
have the boards that I think have done a
 
01:13:58.510 --> 01:13:58.520 align:start position:0%
very good job to vet those and bring
 
01:13:59.990 --> 01:14:00.000 align:start position:0%
them forward to so we have a good
 
01:14:03.510 --> 01:14:03.520 align:start position:0%
package um so just offer those thoughts
 
01:14:06.070 --> 01:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh happy to answer any questions thank
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%

01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
questions representative gold thank you

01:15:19.679 --> 01:15:21.189 align:start position:0%
codes but I'll give you data as to
exactly

01:15:21.189 --> 01:15:21.199 align:start position:0%
exactly

01:15:27.390 --> 01:15:27.400 align:start position:0%
builders has done research across this
 
01:15:30.229 --> 01:15:30.239 align:start position:0%
and it's going to cost a new
 
01:15:33.950 --> 01:15:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:35.790 --> 01:15:35.800 align:start position:0%
$31,000 what they're going to do is
 
01:15:37.950 --> 01:15:37.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to roll that into their
 
01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
mortgage so at a 30-year fixed I went
 
01:15:45.470 --> 01:15:45.480 align:start position:0%
with 7% I personally pay
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
7.65% for my home by 7% that increases
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
their monthly mortgage payment $26
 
01:15:57.590 --> 01:15:57.600 align:start position:0%
at the end of that mortgage period it's
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
going to
 
01:16:01.709 --> 01:16:01.719 align:start position:0%
cost to upgrade the homes for the 2021
 
01:16:08.470 --> 01:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:11.950 --> 01:16:11.960 align:start position:0%
74,0 that's a green energy tax placed
 
01:16:15.110 --> 01:16:15.120 align:start position:0%
right on the heads and the wallets of

on the
 
01:16:30.510 --> 01:16:30.520 align:start position:0%
payback I have the data happy to with
 
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
anyone the thermal envelope change the
 
01:16:36.310 --> 01:16:36.320 align:start position:0%

01:16:45.669 --> 01:16:45.679 align:start position:0%

01:16:49.550 --> 01:16:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:52.510 --> 01:16:52.520 align:start position:0%

years and 115
 
01:17:05.430 --> 01:17:05.440 align:start position:0%
years let's talk about the water
 
01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:07.800 align:start position:0%
heater that's the quickest
 
01:17:12.229 --> 01:17:12.239 align:start position:0%
payback at 24 years and 27 years
 
01:17:15.310 --> 01:17:15.320 align:start position:0%
depending on which climate zone you're
 
01:17:18.590 --> 01:17:18.600 align:start position:0%

$75,000 for the Energy
 
01:17:23.270 --> 01:17:23.280 align:start position:0%

01:17:25.629 --> 01:17:25.639 align:start position:0%
money back unless you're Immortal of
 
01:17:27.470 --> 01:17:27.480 align:start position:0%
course or you bought your house when
 
01:17:27.480 --> 01:17:29.149 align:start position:0%
course or you bought your house when
you're

01:17:29.149 --> 01:17:29.159 align:start position:0%
you're
 
01:17:33.070 --> 01:17:33.080 align:start position:0%
10 I have this again and again and again
 
01:17:35.870 --> 01:17:35.880 align:start position:0%
of exact numbers and the exact
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
paybacks please do not accept that
 
01:17:43.110 --> 01:17:43.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment you're
 
01:17:45.310 --> 01:17:45.320 align:start position:0%
burdening I'm not worried about Coke I'm
 
01:17:46.790 --> 01:17:46.800 align:start position:0%
not worried about Pepsi I'm not worried
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
about Sig sour I'm worried about your
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
constituents I'm worried about my
 
01:17:55.070 --> 01:17:55.080 align:start position:0%
builders we have a hard time finding
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
labor and we're driving them out of the
 
01:18:02.070 --> 01:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
state so you want to toss on $331,000 on
 
01:18:04.709 --> 01:18:04.719 align:start position:0%
top of their head that they'll never see
 
01:18:06.910 --> 01:18:06.920 align:start position:0%
their money back on it's going to cost
 
01:18:06.920 --> 01:18:08.470 align:start position:0%
their money back on it's going to cost
them

01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:18:11.629 --> 01:18:11.639 align:start position:0%
$75,000 at the end of this when we talk
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
about the state energy
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
codes and doing my research for this
 
01:18:19.390 --> 01:18:19.400 align:start position:0%
again I had mentioned that you know 31
 
01:18:23.790 --> 01:18:23.800 align:start position:0%
States operate under pre 2018 energy
 
01:18:26.110 --> 01:18:26.120 align:start position:0%
codes that includes
 
01:18:28.750 --> 01:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
California which operates under the
 
01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
2012 energy codes the state of
 
01:18:35.950 --> 01:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
Oregon Vermont operates under the
 
01:18:38.350 --> 01:18:38.360 align:start position:0%
2015 energy
 
01:18:41.790 --> 01:18:41.800 align:start position:0%
codes and the state of
 
01:18:45.149 --> 01:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
Texas has operates under the um 2015
 
01:18:48.510 --> 01:18:48.520 align:start position:0%
energy codes also Texas is not having a
 
01:18:50.910 --> 01:18:50.920 align:start position:0%
problem recruiting businesses to come to
 
01:18:53.590 --> 01:18:53.600 align:start position:0%
their state so so it's not keeping
 
01:18:55.430 --> 01:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
anyone from coming to New
 
01:18:57.950 --> 01:18:57.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but it's costing the labor
 
01:19:02.149 --> 01:19:02.159 align:start position:0%
force to staff those businesses they
 
01:19:04.149 --> 01:19:04.159 align:start position:0%
can't get them that's the
 
01:19:04.159 --> 01:19:06.510 align:start position:0%
can't get them that's the
challenge

01:19:06.510 --> 01:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
challenge
 
01:19:09.990 --> 01:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
31,000 for those for that amendment is
 
01:19:11.910 --> 01:19:11.920 align:start position:0%
it worth
 
01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:15.560 align:start position:0%
$75,000 uh I'm imposed to the bill I
 
01:19:17.669 --> 01:19:17.679 align:start position:0%
disagree with my colleagues and friends
 
01:19:19.470 --> 01:19:19.480 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
bcrb because I hear from the builders
 
01:19:25.270 --> 01:19:25.280 align:start position:0%
who actually construct the homes they
 
01:19:28.229 --> 01:19:28.239 align:start position:0%
don't design it they don't engineer it
 
01:19:29.910 --> 01:19:29.920 align:start position:0%
the abstract they're in the field
 
01:19:31.390 --> 01:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
talking to the
 
01:19:34.830 --> 01:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
consumers and building the
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
homes representative you had mentioned
 
01:19:38.110 --> 01:19:38.120 align:start position:0%
about air
 
01:19:41.470 --> 01:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
exchanges and the air quality what we'd
 
01:19:44.070 --> 01:19:44.080 align:start position:0%
like to ask the committee to please
 
01:19:47.870 --> 01:19:47.880 align:start position:0%
consider is a few years back we allowed
 
01:19:49.310 --> 01:19:49.320 align:start position:0%
five air
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
exchanges per
 
01:19:54.470 --> 01:19:54.480 align:start position:0%
hour the state wanted to tighten things
 
01:19:57.870 --> 01:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
up try to make houses more airtight we
 
01:19:59.590 --> 01:19:59.600 align:start position:0%
all know houses need to breathe a little
 
01:20:02.830 --> 01:20:02.840 align:start position:0%
bit you got to let some air Exchange in
 
01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:06.520 align:start position:0%
there and we went to three air
 
01:20:11.189 --> 01:20:11.199 align:start position:0%
exchanges we're seeing increases of mold
 
01:20:13.629 --> 01:20:13.639 align:start position:0%
mildew respiratory
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
illnesses the
 
01:20:18.830 --> 01:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
CDC has even Rec has has even stated
 
01:20:22.189 --> 01:20:22.199 align:start position:0%
that we're making our homes too tight
 
01:20:25.149 --> 01:20:25.159 align:start position:0%
we're not any exchange of air so we're
 
01:20:28.070 --> 01:20:28.080 align:start position:0%
asking you to please go back to where we
 
01:20:31.669 --> 01:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
were before for five air exchanges
 
01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
please we experimented with three we're
 
01:20:39.310 --> 01:20:39.320 align:start position:0%
paying the price let's go back it also
 
01:20:40.830 --> 01:20:40.840 align:start position:0%
cost more money
 
01:20:44.390 --> 01:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
because roughly 8% of homes their first
 
01:20:48.270 --> 01:20:48.280 align:start position:0%
time out can hit three air
 
01:20:51.669 --> 01:20:51.679 align:start position:0%
exchanges so what has to happen is you
 
01:20:54.149 --> 01:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
have to go
 
01:20:57.229 --> 01:20:57.239 align:start position:0%
you get the test you fail you have to
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
make more modifications to the
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
home then you have to bring out the
 
01:21:04.030 --> 01:21:04.040 align:start position:0%
inspectors and the testers again to try
 
01:21:07.950 --> 01:21:07.960 align:start position:0%
to get to that magic number
 
01:21:11.270 --> 01:21:11.280 align:start position:0%
three 24% of
 
01:21:14.830 --> 01:21:14.840 align:start position:0%
homes can hit the five air exchanges the
 
01:21:16.750 --> 01:21:16.760 align:start position:0%
first time out and those are still
 
01:21:20.070 --> 01:21:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:23.149 --> 01:21:23.159 align:start position:0%
homes um one thing that
 
01:21:25.510 --> 01:21:25.520 align:start position:0%
just an example of how what you have to
 
01:21:28.790 --> 01:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
do is you can't put carpet down on the
 
01:21:32.229 --> 01:21:32.239 align:start position:0%
floor before you do an air exchange
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
because what happens is especially in a
 
01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:37.560 align:start position:0%
forced hot air system as you know those
 
01:21:40.709 --> 01:21:40.719 align:start position:0%
vents sit on top of the pile of the
 
01:21:44.590 --> 01:21:44.600 align:start position:0%
carpet well air can get through there
 
01:21:46.669 --> 01:21:46.679 align:start position:0%
because you create a vacuum seal trying
 
01:21:49.030 --> 01:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
to find out where it is so you have to
 
01:21:51.229 --> 01:21:51.239 align:start position:0%
take the carpet
 
01:21:54.030 --> 01:21:54.040 align:start position:0%
out seal everything up to try to get to
 
01:21:55.990 --> 01:21:56.000 align:start position:0%
that magic number
 
01:21:58.750 --> 01:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
three so
 
01:22:02.669 --> 01:22:02.679 align:start position:0%
please help us make homes more efficient
 
01:22:04.790 --> 01:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
more affordable get them on the market
 
01:22:07.189 --> 01:22:07.199 align:start position:0%
faster let us go back to the five air
 
01:22:07.199 --> 01:22:09.430 align:start position:0%
faster let us go back to the five air
exchanges

01:22:09.430 --> 01:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
exchanges
 
01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:11.840 align:start position:0%
please the other concern that we have
 
01:22:14.629 --> 01:22:14.639 align:start position:0%
that we'd like the committee to consider
 
01:22:18.910 --> 01:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
please are the issue of self-latching
 
01:22:22.910 --> 01:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
doors right now under the um 2018
 
01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:24.950 align:start position:0%
doors right now under the um 2018
building

01:22:24.950 --> 01:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
building
 
01:22:29.669 --> 01:22:29.679 align:start position:0%
code doors close that's fine in
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
practicality and we've all seen them
 
01:22:34.590 --> 01:22:34.600 align:start position:0%
when you have to have the self-latching
 
01:22:38.590 --> 01:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
door so you hear it Go click behind you
 
01:22:39.870 --> 01:22:39.880 align:start position:0%
there's a certain amount of pressure and
 
01:22:41.950 --> 01:22:41.960 align:start position:0%
there's a mechanism to make sure that
 
01:22:44.030 --> 01:22:44.040 align:start position:0%
that door can close
 
01:22:47.590 --> 01:22:47.600 align:start position:0%
fully if you're older I also have a real
 
01:22:48.910 --> 01:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
estate license and I've been a broker
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
for 35
 
01:22:52.350 --> 01:22:52.360 align:start position:0%
years I have a woman who bought a home
 
01:22:52.360 --> 01:22:53.669 align:start position:0%
years I have a woman who bought a home
in

01:22:53.669 --> 01:22:53.679 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:22:55.669 --> 01:22:55.679 align:start position:0%
napping the builders put in the
 
01:22:57.350 --> 01:22:57.360 align:start position:0%
self-latching doors cuz they saw what
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
was coming down the
 
01:23:02.189 --> 01:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
road first question she asked is how do
 
01:23:03.709 --> 01:23:03.719 align:start position:0%
I disconnect
 
01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
it because I'm by myself so what I to do
 
01:23:10.110 --> 01:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
now she has to open the door going from
 
01:23:13.550 --> 01:23:13.560 align:start position:0%
the garage into the residence she has to
 
01:23:16.830 --> 01:23:16.840 align:start position:0%
open it up stick her cane in the
 
01:23:20.030 --> 01:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
door to prop it open and get grocery
 
01:23:23.790 --> 01:23:23.800 align:start position:0%
bags and take it inside she she is
 
01:23:26.310 --> 01:23:26.320 align:start position:0%
fearful that the pressure of that door
 
01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
closing could knock her
 
01:23:30.390 --> 01:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
over if she hasn't placed something
 
01:23:32.189 --> 01:23:32.199 align:start position:0%
wrong or doesn't wedge it open
 
01:23:34.629 --> 01:23:34.639 align:start position:0%
correctly she goes then I lay on the
 
01:23:36.790 --> 01:23:36.800 align:start position:0%
garage floor until a friend comes by and
 
01:23:38.590 --> 01:23:38.600 align:start position:0%
checks on
 
01:23:40.629 --> 01:23:40.639 align:start position:0%
me that could be five minutes it could
 
01:23:43.629 --> 01:23:43.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:47.189 --> 01:23:47.199 align:start position:0%
days when I brought this issue up to the
 
01:23:50.510 --> 01:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
bcrb and I asked the question Chief Tumi
 
01:23:52.870 --> 01:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
was not there I want to be extremely
 
01:23:56.189 --> 01:23:56.199 align:start position:0%
clear because I asked the question how
 
01:23:59.430 --> 01:23:59.440 align:start position:0%
many fires start in the
 
01:24:01.470 --> 01:24:01.480 align:start position:0%
garage because you're self-latching door
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
you're trying to prevent keep fire from
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
getting to the main residence how many
 
01:24:07.629 --> 01:24:07.639 align:start position:0%
fires start in a garage in New
 
01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:14.390 --> 01:24:14.400 align:start position:0%
question if I was a
 
01:24:16.430 --> 01:24:16.440 align:start position:0%
firefighter I'd be much more consider
 
01:24:19.310 --> 01:24:19.320 align:start position:0%
about candles inside the house
 
01:24:22.910 --> 01:24:22.920 align:start position:0%
burning and people smoking in bed then
 
01:24:24.510 --> 01:24:24.520 align:start position:0%
about the whether a door has self
 
01:24:27.390 --> 01:24:27.400 align:start position:0%
latched or not so we're in disagreement
 
01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:29.520 align:start position:0%
with the bcrb on the self-latching door
 
01:24:32.229 --> 01:24:32.239 align:start position:0%
they already closed
 
01:24:34.790 --> 01:24:34.800 align:start position:0%
now the other one we'd like the
 
01:24:37.510 --> 01:24:37.520 align:start position:0%
committee to please consider is moving
 
01:24:41.430 --> 01:24:41.440 align:start position:0%
marac County from zone six to climate
 
01:24:44.189 --> 01:24:44.199 align:start position:0%
zone 5 on the testimony that I handed
 
01:24:47.270 --> 01:24:47.280 align:start position:0%
out to you you'll see a
 
01:24:51.350 --> 01:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
map and marac county is right on that
 
01:24:51.360 --> 01:24:53.510 align:start position:0%
map and marac county is right on that
line

01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:53.520 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:24:56.149 --> 01:24:56.159 align:start position:0%
right now it's the same it's in climate
 
01:24:59.950 --> 01:24:59.960 align:start position:0%
zone 6 which is the same as Olive Co
 
01:25:02.109 --> 01:25:02.119 align:start position:0%
County the state of
 
01:25:06.990 --> 01:25:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:09.590 --> 01:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
Maine if it move down to if it moved to
 
01:25:11.310 --> 01:25:11.320 align:start position:0%
climate zone
 
01:25:15.350 --> 01:25:15.360 align:start position:0%
five that would help save homeowners
 
01:25:17.830 --> 01:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
money while still getting great
 
01:25:20.950 --> 01:25:20.960 align:start position:0%
instulation climate zone 6 for instance
 
01:25:23.270 --> 01:25:23.280 align:start position:0%
in the ceiling installation
 
01:25:26.629 --> 01:25:26.639 align:start position:0%
you have to have an R value of
 
01:25:29.470 --> 01:25:29.480 align:start position:0%
60 if you in climate zone
 
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
five just a mile down the
 
01:25:36.629 --> 01:25:36.639 align:start position:0%
road it now comes out to be an r factor
 
01:25:36.639 --> 01:25:38.950 align:start position:0%
road it now comes out to be an r factor
of

01:25:38.950 --> 01:25:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
49 so it saves the consumers money home
 
01:25:46.310 --> 01:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
builders are not in the business of
 
01:25:49.310 --> 01:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
taking people's money we want to the
 
01:25:51.350 --> 01:25:51.360 align:start position:0%
housing that you folks are asking us for
 
01:25:52.830 --> 01:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get there
 
01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:55.360 align:start position:0%
we're trying to keep the cost
 
01:26:00.310 --> 01:26:00.320 align:start position:0%
down this helps I mean um I won't ramble
 
01:26:03.470 --> 01:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
on anymore but those are the three
 
01:26:05.750 --> 01:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
considerations we'd ask the committee to
 
01:26:07.470 --> 01:26:07.480 align:start position:0%
please consider because that's where the
 
01:26:07.480 --> 01:26:08.229 align:start position:0%
please consider because that's where the
homeb

01:26:08.229 --> 01:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
homeb
 
01:26:11.790 --> 01:26:11.800 align:start position:0%
builders our 36,000 people have
 
01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
expressed disagreement with the bcrb on
 
01:26:18.470 --> 01:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
please and on that energy code
 
01:26:21.790 --> 01:26:21.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment please in a time when people
 
01:26:23.750 --> 01:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
can't afford the rent because what's
 
01:26:26.990 --> 01:26:27.000 align:start position:0%
going to happen is those mandates and it
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
01:26:30.790 --> 01:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
mandate will be passed directly on to
 
01:26:32.109 --> 01:26:32.119 align:start position:0%
those who are
 
01:26:36.870 --> 01:26:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:39.229 --> 01:26:39.239 align:start position:0%
home and most people can't write a check
 
01:26:39.239 --> 01:26:40.709 align:start position:0%
home and most people can't write a check
for

01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:26:44.470 --> 01:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
$311,000 so the com was made about you
 
01:26:47.709 --> 01:26:47.719 align:start position:0%
know large housing it's going to get the
 
01:26:49.109 --> 01:26:49.119 align:start position:0%
high rents are going to go up even
 
01:26:51.950 --> 01:26:51.960 align:start position:0%
higher so please don't do that this year
 
01:26:51.960 --> 01:26:53.790 align:start position:0%
higher so please don't do that this year
please

01:26:53.790 --> 01:26:53.800 align:start position:0%
please
 
01:26:56.070 --> 01:26:56.080 align:start position:0%
please thank you thank you for your
 
01:26:59.390 --> 01:26:59.400 align:start position:0%
testimony representative lus thank you
 
01:27:02.310 --> 01:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
um a question and and a request for
 
01:27:04.470 --> 01:27:04.480 align:start position:0%
information so you stated you're against
 
01:27:05.669 --> 01:27:05.679 align:start position:0%
the bill but the question is are you
 
01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:07.360 align:start position:0%
against the bill are you against the
 
01:27:11.189 --> 01:27:11.199 align:start position:0%
amendment which adds the uh energy code
 
01:27:13.430 --> 01:27:13.440 align:start position:0%
I am against the amendment because that
 
01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:14.960 align:start position:0%
was a good
 
01:27:17.149 --> 01:27:17.159 align:start position:0%
morning um so I wanted to add that in
 
01:27:20.229 --> 01:27:20.239 align:start position:0%
there but as the bill is
 
01:27:23.390 --> 01:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
written we are against it because we
 
01:27:25.750 --> 01:27:25.760 align:start position:0%
those air exchanges are
 
01:27:29.790 --> 01:27:29.800 align:start position:0%
important for homes the self-latching
 
01:27:32.629 --> 01:27:32.639 align:start position:0%
doors we feel are important and moving
 
01:27:36.070 --> 01:27:36.080 align:start position:0%
the climate zone for Marat County from 5
 
01:27:38.310 --> 01:27:38.320 align:start position:0%
to six so that's why we oppose the bill
 
01:27:41.030 --> 01:27:41.040 align:start position:0%
as written so follow up follow up so
 
01:27:43.310 --> 01:27:43.320 align:start position:0%
those uh particular items they're in
 
01:27:44.950 --> 01:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
they're not in the energy part but
 
01:27:46.669 --> 01:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
they're in other parts of the building
 
01:27:47.870 --> 01:27:47.880 align:start position:0%
code is that cor building code yes
 
01:27:49.470 --> 01:27:49.480 align:start position:0%
please that's why was against the the
 
01:27:52.430 --> 01:27:52.440 align:start position:0%
bill as proposed follow up follow up
 
01:27:54.669 --> 01:27:54.679 align:start position:0%
yeah and you had uh you mentioned some
 
01:27:57.709 --> 01:27:57.719 align:start position:0%
numbers on cost and payback for the
 
01:27:59.310 --> 01:27:59.320 align:start position:0%
energy part I'm not seeing it in the
 
01:28:00.629 --> 01:28:00.639 align:start position:0%
written stuff we have could you please
 
01:28:02.669 --> 01:28:02.679 align:start position:0%
send it of course absolutely thank you
 
01:28:04.350 --> 01:28:04.360 align:start position:0%
I'll translate all my little yellow
 
01:28:05.629 --> 01:28:05.639 align:start position:0%
sticky notes
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
into and I'll have that for the
 
01:28:09.870 --> 01:28:09.880 align:start position:0%
committee great away okay representative
 
01:28:13.550 --> 01:28:13.560 align:start position:0%
Greta thank you so um I have a request
 
01:28:15.350 --> 01:28:15.360 align:start position:0%
so while you're giving that information
 
01:28:17.950 --> 01:28:17.960 align:start position:0%
to representative leus could you also
 
01:28:19.910 --> 01:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
include the information for commercial
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
buildings because you mentioned resident
 
01:28:26.550 --> 01:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
only and the amendment only addresses
 
01:28:28.629 --> 01:28:28.639 align:start position:0%
commercial so your data doesn't really
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
apply in my view to the Amendments so if
 
01:28:32.189 --> 01:28:32.199 align:start position:0%
you could include that that would be
 
01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:34.600 align:start position:0%
beneficial um of course what I would
 
01:28:37.030 --> 01:28:37.040 align:start position:0%
have to do is because we
 
01:28:40.430 --> 01:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
specialize as on the residential side I
 
01:28:42.830 --> 01:28:42.840 align:start position:0%
would ask Joshua reap at the association
 
01:28:44.270 --> 01:28:44.280 align:start position:0%
of builders and contractors who deal
 
01:28:45.590 --> 01:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
with the commercial
 
01:28:48.510 --> 01:28:48.520 align:start position:0%
side um I would ask them to you know get
 
01:28:50.109 --> 01:28:50.119 align:start position:0%
that and I can certainly convey that
 
01:28:52.990 --> 01:28:53.000 align:start position:0%
request along and I think
 
01:28:57.149 --> 01:28:57.159 align:start position:0%
in and on here ma'am if I
 
01:28:59.470 --> 01:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
may I didn't see on the amendment where
 
01:29:01.990 --> 01:29:02.000 align:start position:0%
it says just commercial it just says the
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
20 move the 2018 energy code in its
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
entirety to the
 
01:29:10.510 --> 01:29:10.520 align:start position:0%
2021 energy code in its
 
01:29:12.990 --> 01:29:13.000 align:start position:0%
entirety okay well the sponsor of the
 
01:29:14.950 --> 01:29:14.960 align:start position:0%
amendment said otherwise so I'll have to
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
discuss that with her of
 
01:29:19.709 --> 01:29:19.719 align:start position:0%
course representative
 
01:29:23.390 --> 01:29:23.400 align:start position:0%
dlan thank you Mr chair uh
 
01:29:27.310 --> 01:29:27.320 align:start position:0%
Mr Maybury can could you comment on your
 
01:29:31.030 --> 01:29:31.040 align:start position:0%
organization's uh feelings about this
 
01:29:33.510 --> 01:29:33.520 align:start position:0%
General move towards
 
01:29:37.070 --> 01:29:37.080 align:start position:0%
electrification um that uh we're seeing
 
01:29:39.390 --> 01:29:39.400 align:start position:0%
which I think is underlying a lot of the
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
comments today what what happens we
 
01:29:46.270 --> 01:29:46.280 align:start position:0%
talking about an a perfect theoretical
 
01:29:47.910 --> 01:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
World here what happens in the real
 
01:29:52.310 --> 01:29:52.320 align:start position:0%
world where the community says we can't
 
01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.040 align:start position:0%
turn all our air conditioners on this
 
01:29:58.950 --> 01:29:58.960 align:start position:0%
summer and so you have to have to be hot
 
01:30:02.310 --> 01:30:02.320 align:start position:0%
or we can't uh plug our electric our new
 
01:30:04.910 --> 01:30:04.920 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles in because the because
 
01:30:07.030 --> 01:30:07.040 align:start position:0%
the power grid just can't support what
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
we're trying to get it to do what do we
 
01:30:11.510 --> 01:30:11.520 align:start position:0%
do in those situations and what are your
 
01:30:14.310 --> 01:30:14.320 align:start position:0%
recommendations to how to deal with the
 
01:30:17.870 --> 01:30:17.880 align:start position:0%
with the issue of of power grid not
 
01:30:20.070 --> 01:30:20.080 align:start position:0%
supporting uh what the building code
 
01:30:22.590 --> 01:30:22.600 align:start position:0%
might be looking to do absolutely
 
01:30:24.910 --> 01:30:24.920 align:start position:0%
representative and thank you we're
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
seeing it now where you can't charge
 
01:30:29.709 --> 01:30:29.719 align:start position:0%
your cars at certain hours of the
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
day especially out
 
01:30:36.350 --> 01:30:36.360 align:start position:0%
west the energy has to get created from
 
01:30:36.360 --> 01:30:38.030 align:start position:0%
west the energy has to get created from
somewhere

01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.040 align:start position:0%
somewhere
 
01:30:40.470 --> 01:30:40.480 align:start position:0%
somehow we're talking about solar panels
 
01:30:41.590 --> 01:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the disposal of
 
01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.550 align:start position:0%
we're talking about the disposal of
lithium

01:30:42.550 --> 01:30:42.560 align:start position:0%
lithium
 
01:30:44.669 --> 01:30:44.679 align:start position:0%
batteries how are we going to contend
 
01:30:44.679 --> 01:30:46.950 align:start position:0%
batteries how are we going to contend
with

01:30:46.950 --> 01:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:46.960 --> 01:30:49.870 align:start position:0%
 
that

01:30:49.870 --> 01:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:30:52.550 --> 01:30:52.560 align:start position:0%
when the New Hampshire Home Building ERS
 
01:30:55.189 --> 01:30:55.199 align:start position:0%
Association and myself personally are an
 
01:30:57.470 --> 01:30:57.480 align:start position:0%
all the above
 
01:30:59.390 --> 01:30:59.400 align:start position:0%
approach because if you have a
 
01:31:03.310 --> 01:31:03.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:06.229 --> 01:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
down you have a world of heart if
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
everything is hinging upon
 
01:31:10.790 --> 01:31:10.800 align:start position:0%
electric you're starting to hear a
 
01:31:13.870 --> 01:31:13.880 align:start position:0%
little bit about it along the sides and
 
01:31:15.910 --> 01:31:15.920 align:start position:0%
at a later date you know we can talk
 
01:31:17.030 --> 01:31:17.040 align:start position:0%
more about
 
01:31:20.750 --> 01:31:20.760 align:start position:0%
it but when electric vehicles are in
 
01:31:20.760 --> 01:31:22.590 align:start position:0%
it but when electric vehicles are in
accidents

01:31:22.590 --> 01:31:22.600 align:start position:0%
accidents
 
01:31:25.550 --> 01:31:25.560 align:start position:0%
they burn so
 
01:31:28.870 --> 01:31:28.880 align:start position:0%
hot that it it's extremely hard to put
 
01:31:30.270 --> 01:31:30.280 align:start position:0%
out that
 
01:31:32.790 --> 01:31:32.800 align:start position:0%
fire if you're putting an electric
 
01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
vehicle inside a garage or you seen
 
01:31:39.030 --> 01:31:39.040 align:start position:0%
there's legislation before you folks on
 
01:31:41.350 --> 01:31:41.360 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and banning them from
 
01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.430 align:start position:0%
electric vehicles and banning them from
parking

01:31:43.430 --> 01:31:43.440 align:start position:0%
parking
 
01:31:46.669 --> 01:31:46.679 align:start position:0%
garages why because when they catch on
 
01:31:50.990 --> 01:31:51.000 align:start position:0%
fire they burn so hot it's incredibly
 
01:31:52.830 --> 01:31:52.840 align:start position:0%
hard to put out the those fires Chief
 
01:31:54.550 --> 01:31:54.560 align:start position:0%
Tumi could talk more about what it takes
 
01:31:56.669 --> 01:31:56.679 align:start position:0%
to put out a fire in an electric
 
01:31:59.990 --> 01:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
vehicle but I think when you put all
 
01:32:02.550 --> 01:32:02.560 align:start position:0%
your eggs in a prover proverbial energy
 
01:32:05.109 --> 01:32:05.119 align:start position:0%
basket you're asking for
 
01:32:07.709 --> 01:32:07.719 align:start position:0%
trouble thank you we have natural gas
 
01:32:10.669 --> 01:32:10.679 align:start position:0%
and propane and you know wind and solar
 
01:32:12.910 --> 01:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
and let the consumers
 
01:32:18.189 --> 01:32:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:21.270 --> 01:32:21.280 align:start position:0%
electrification I trust our constituents
 
01:32:23.550 --> 01:32:23.560 align:start position:0%
let them decide how they want to heat
 
01:32:25.350 --> 01:32:25.360 align:start position:0%
their home and power their
 
01:32:28.750 --> 01:32:28.760 align:start position:0%
home but again please don't start off
 
01:32:36.189 --> 01:32:36.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.470 --> 01:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
debt thank you Mr Shar and thank you for
 
01:32:40.270 --> 01:32:40.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question I'm wondering
 
01:32:44.950 --> 01:32:44.960 align:start position:0%
regarding the um zone change yes um is
 
01:32:46.910 --> 01:32:46.920 align:start position:0%
that predicated at all on the trend
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in in a warmer climate for
 
01:32:49.560 --> 01:32:50.629 align:start position:0%
we're seeing in in a warmer climate for
marrat

01:32:50.629 --> 01:32:50.639 align:start position:0%
marrat
 
01:32:50.639 --> 01:32:52.149 align:start position:0%
marrat
County

01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
County
 
01:32:54.390 --> 01:32:54.400 align:start position:0%
the recommendation came from the US uh
 
01:32:55.870 --> 01:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:32:59.109 --> 01:32:59.119 align:start position:0%
energy and I think we all see how little
 
01:33:02.030 --> 01:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
snow we've been getting so
 
01:33:06.990 --> 01:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:09.030 --> 01:33:09.040 align:start position:0%
don't I don't
 
01:33:11.750 --> 01:33:11.760 align:start position:0%
know I just wondered what the basis oh
 
01:33:14.030 --> 01:33:14.040 align:start position:0%
sorry followup follow I wondered what
 
01:33:15.870 --> 01:33:15.880 align:start position:0%
the basis might have been for your
 
01:33:19.590 --> 01:33:19.600 align:start position:0%
recommendation other than just it it
 
01:33:21.109 --> 01:33:21.119 align:start position:0%
came from the Department of energy and
 
01:33:23.550 --> 01:33:23.560 align:start position:0%
so the US Department of energy so
 
01:33:26.350 --> 01:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
representative I didn't find out as to
 
01:33:30.470 --> 01:33:30.480 align:start position:0%
why but driving through maram
 
01:33:32.910 --> 01:33:32.920 align:start position:0%
County you know as you see the Raging
 
01:33:35.350 --> 01:33:35.360 align:start position:0%
snowstorm going on outside right
 
01:33:39.669 --> 01:33:39.679 align:start position:0%
now the sun's about to break out um so
 
01:33:43.350 --> 01:33:43.360 align:start position:0%
thank you yes any other
 
01:33:45.390 --> 01:33:45.400 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:33:46.830 --> 01:33:46.840 align:start position:0%
time thank you and I'll get that
 
01:33:48.390 --> 01:33:48.400 align:start position:0%
information to the committee right Away
 
01:33:50.070 --> 01:33:50.080 align:start position:0%
Great thank you thank
 
01:33:53.870 --> 01:33:53.880 align:start position:0%
you um Gary appet speaking in support of
 
01:34:12.310 --> 01:34:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:14.229 --> 01:34:14.239 align:start position:0%
contractors thank you
 
01:34:16.910 --> 01:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
chairman uh thank you for being before
 
01:34:19.270 --> 01:34:19.280 align:start position:0%
the committee today my name is Gary
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
Abbott I'm the Executive Vice President
 
01:34:24.310 --> 01:34:24.320 align:start position:0%
of the associated general contractors of
 
01:34:24.320 --> 01:34:25.149 align:start position:0%
of the associated general contractors of
New

01:34:25.149 --> 01:34:25.159 align:start position:0%
New
 
01:34:27.189 --> 01:34:27.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um I'm going to break my
 
01:34:28.790 --> 01:34:28.800 align:start position:0%
testimony into two parts but I'm going
 
01:34:32.550 --> 01:34:32.560 align:start position:0%
to start off with this I was around uh
 
01:34:34.830 --> 01:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
in support of the Statewide building
 
01:34:37.109 --> 01:34:37.119 align:start position:0%
code when it first got adopted in the
 
01:34:40.830 --> 01:34:40.840 align:start position:0%
90s in the early 90s and it was in the
 
01:34:42.750 --> 01:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
Statewide building code it was two codes
 
01:34:44.470 --> 01:34:44.480 align:start position:0%
it was the commercial code and I
 
01:34:47.709 --> 01:34:47.719 align:start position:0%
represent commercial contractors and it
 
01:34:50.229 --> 01:34:50.239 align:start position:0%
was the fire code there were no other
 
01:34:53.070 --> 01:34:53.080 align:start position:0%
codes as you have here today it started
 
01:34:56.310 --> 01:34:56.320 align:start position:0%
with those two codes over time the
 
01:34:59.189 --> 01:34:59.199 align:start position:0%
residential code all these other codes
 
01:35:02.350 --> 01:35:02.360 align:start position:0%
ended up being put into the statute that
 
01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
uh became part of the Statewide building
 
01:35:07.149 --> 01:35:07.159 align:start position:0%
code we've had a lot of
 
01:35:09.950 --> 01:35:09.960 align:start position:0%
success in that development we put
 
01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:11.669 align:start position:0%
success in that development we put
together

01:35:11.669 --> 01:35:11.679 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
a building code Advisory board that
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
would look at amendments and changes and
 
01:35:20.149 --> 01:35:20.159 align:start position:0%
I can tell you even when we did the
 
01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:22.880 align:start position:0%
first code there were amendments
 
01:35:25.229 --> 01:35:25.239 align:start position:0%
National codes are not perfect for New
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so we need to do amendments
 
01:35:30.109 --> 01:35:30.119 align:start position:0%
one of the first amendments was snow
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
loads most of these codes and I want to
 
01:35:34.350 --> 01:35:34.360 align:start position:0%
se I want to make sure you're really
 
01:35:37.109 --> 01:35:37.119 align:start position:0%
clear most of these codes are set up for
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
safety and structural that's what most
 
01:35:43.350 --> 01:35:43.360 align:start position:0%
of the commercial codes are so we
 
01:35:46.109 --> 01:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
support the original bill because it
 
01:35:49.030 --> 01:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
updates those codes with the appropriate
 
01:35:51.390 --> 01:35:51.400 align:start position:0%
amendments that the building code ad
 
01:35:54.350 --> 01:35:54.360 align:start position:0%
Advisory Board recommends and I look at
 
01:35:56.229 --> 01:35:56.239 align:start position:0%
those the building code revisory board
 
01:35:59.030 --> 01:35:59.040 align:start position:0%
is made up of experts including a
 
01:36:01.590 --> 01:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
representative or our association before
 
01:36:04.149 --> 01:36:04.159 align:start position:0%
that board that represents commercial
 
01:36:06.750 --> 01:36:06.760 align:start position:0%
construction and he looks at those codes
 
01:36:07.750 --> 01:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
and makes
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
recommendations those are the best
 
01:36:12.270 --> 01:36:12.280 align:start position:0%
people Beyond say an association
 
01:36:14.950 --> 01:36:14.960 align:start position:0%
director you want those
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
experts so I look at we're at a
 
01:36:20.109 --> 01:36:20.119 align:start position:0%
Crossroads because we're we're up to
 
01:36:22.790 --> 01:36:22.800 align:start position:0%
date 28 18 is pretty good because I can
 
01:36:24.189 --> 01:36:24.199 align:start position:0%
tell you before we had a Statewide
 
01:36:26.350 --> 01:36:26.360 align:start position:0%
building code we had some codes that
 
01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
were 15 years behind so we're really
 
01:36:31.750 --> 01:36:31.760 align:start position:0%
good today I just want to make sure
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
you're clear when people are talking
 
01:36:35.189 --> 01:36:35.199 align:start position:0%
about oh we're three years behind I'm
 
01:36:37.669 --> 01:36:37.679 align:start position:0%
like this is way better than we used to
 
01:36:39.870 --> 01:36:39.880 align:start position:0%
be in the 80s and 90s before we had a
 
01:36:41.709 --> 01:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
Statewide building
 
01:36:44.629 --> 01:36:44.639 align:start position:0%
code so then I want to look at the
 
01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:48.159 align:start position:0%
energy code totally different animal
 
01:36:50.790 --> 01:36:50.800 align:start position:0%
that was added to the code because it's
 
01:36:53.189 --> 01:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
not about about the structural it's not
 
01:36:56.350 --> 01:36:56.360 align:start position:0%
about many of those safety issues or
 
01:36:58.629 --> 01:36:58.639 align:start position:0%
dealing with how well your building's
 
01:37:01.590 --> 01:37:01.600 align:start position:0%
built for a hurricane that kind of thing
 
01:37:03.229 --> 01:37:03.239 align:start position:0%
and if you know there are amendments I
 
01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
can tell you when on the energy
 
01:37:06.669 --> 01:37:06.679 align:start position:0%
Commercial Code we've asked for
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
amendments to the 2018 code that were
 
01:37:11.910 --> 01:37:11.920 align:start position:0%
accepted that would cost commercial
 
01:37:13.910 --> 01:37:13.920 align:start position:0%
contractors substantial and made the
 
01:37:16.310 --> 01:37:16.320 align:start position:0%
case before the building code review
 
01:37:19.510 --> 01:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
board and we got that Amendment so when
 
01:37:22.070 --> 01:37:22.080 align:start position:0%
you look at updating the code I feel
 
01:37:24.790 --> 01:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
like the building code review board
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
looked at updating the TW to the
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
2021 and they yes we're not unanimous
 
01:37:35.629 --> 01:37:35.639 align:start position:0%
but they voted not to update it why well
 
01:37:40.510 --> 01:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
the reason why is the cost my Commercial
 
01:37:42.270 --> 01:37:42.280 align:start position:0%
contractor who sits on there said I
 
01:37:43.910 --> 01:37:43.920 align:start position:0%
asked them why why don't why don't we go
 
01:37:46.310 --> 01:37:46.320 align:start position:0%
to the new one with amendments he was
 
01:37:48.109 --> 01:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
like we'd have to make so many
 
01:37:51.870 --> 01:37:51.880 align:start position:0%
amendments because of the cost now my
 
01:37:54.189 --> 01:37:54.199 align:start position:0%
contractor representative also builds
 
01:37:56.950 --> 01:37:56.960 align:start position:0%
affordable housing under the commercial
 
01:37:58.830 --> 01:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
and he said the price tag that would be
 
01:38:01.550 --> 01:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
added to it would make it no longer
 
01:38:04.470 --> 01:38:04.480 align:start position:0%
affordable housing he would have trouble
 
01:38:06.510 --> 01:38:06.520 align:start position:0%
so I'm trusting a person who's an expert
 
01:38:08.709 --> 01:38:08.719 align:start position:0%
who's got to buy these products that are
 
01:38:11.550 --> 01:38:11.560 align:start position:0%
in the energy code and what it will cost
 
01:38:13.109 --> 01:38:13.119 align:start position:0%
he's not even sure some of the projects
 
01:38:17.189 --> 01:38:17.199 align:start position:0%
would go if the standard were raised so
 
01:38:19.149 --> 01:38:19.159 align:start position:0%
I'm really looking at the energy code is
 
01:38:21.629 --> 01:38:21.639 align:start position:0%
a total different animal
 
01:38:23.390 --> 01:38:23.400 align:start position:0%
than the other codes and hope that the
 
01:38:24.750 --> 01:38:24.760 align:start position:0%
committee would support all the other
 
01:38:27.310 --> 01:38:27.320 align:start position:0%
codes I haven't really heard any major
 
01:38:29.709 --> 01:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
disagreement with the updating all the
 
01:38:32.109 --> 01:38:32.119 align:start position:0%
other codes from 18 to
 
01:38:35.750 --> 01:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
21 I say the energy is at a Crossroads
 
01:38:38.550 --> 01:38:38.560 align:start position:0%
because we have some insight of what's
 
01:38:40.910 --> 01:38:40.920 align:start position:0%
coming to in the future and it's going
 
01:38:43.990 --> 01:38:44.000 align:start position:0%
to be the debate over like stoves have
 
01:38:45.030 --> 01:38:45.040 align:start position:0%
to be
 
01:38:47.270 --> 01:38:47.280 align:start position:0%
electric and the legislature's already
 
01:38:49.270 --> 01:38:49.280 align:start position:0%
addressed the issue last year saying you
 
01:38:51.750 --> 01:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
can't mandate it and that's why we have
 
01:38:54.830 --> 01:38:54.840 align:start position:0%
amendments but we know the energy code
 
01:38:58.070 --> 01:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
is starting to get into an area where
 
01:39:00.629 --> 01:39:00.639 align:start position:0%
the cost and affordability is looked at
 
01:39:02.270 --> 01:39:02.280 align:start position:0%
so that's why I say you're at this
 
01:39:02.280 --> 01:39:03.390 align:start position:0%
so that's why I say you're at this
critical

01:39:03.390 --> 01:39:03.400 align:start position:0%
critical
 
01:39:06.270 --> 01:39:06.280 align:start position:0%
point I don't think the building code
 
01:39:09.030 --> 01:39:09.040 align:start position:0%
Review Board in a month or two months
 
01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:11.520 align:start position:0%
can give you the total amendment that
 
01:39:13.229 --> 01:39:13.239 align:start position:0%
would need to be necessary for the
 
01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:15.560 align:start position:0%
energy code I think they would need more
 
01:39:18.109 --> 01:39:18.119 align:start position:0%
time if you wanted them to look at it
 
01:39:20.470 --> 01:39:20.480 align:start position:0%
now whether you drafted language that
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
said you as the legislature would like
 
01:39:24.669 --> 01:39:24.679 align:start position:0%
to know more information about the
 
01:39:26.950 --> 01:39:26.960 align:start position:0%
energy code and why we couldn't or what
 
01:39:29.990 --> 01:39:30.000 align:start position:0%
amendments would have to happen I'm fine
 
01:39:31.709 --> 01:39:31.719 align:start position:0%
with that because I think you might want
 
01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
that on the table I think today for
 
01:39:37.470 --> 01:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
anyone to pick a given part because
 
01:39:39.310 --> 01:39:39.320 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of components to the I
 
01:39:41.910 --> 01:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
don't know the whole energy code I don't
 
01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:44.040 align:start position:0%
know all of the components I only know
 
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
them When contractors call me and say
 
01:39:48.589 --> 01:39:48.599 align:start position:0%
this section is a
 
01:39:50.990 --> 01:39:51.000 align:start position:0%
disaster so that's when we go before the
 
01:39:53.589 --> 01:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
building code review board so when I
 
01:39:55.390 --> 01:39:55.400 align:start position:0%
talk to my representative on the review
 
01:39:58.629 --> 01:39:58.639 align:start position:0%
board he's like we decided to stay with
 
01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
a 2018 because that's a good code it's a
 
01:40:04.550 --> 01:40:04.560 align:start position:0%
good energy code leave it in the project
 
01:40:07.390 --> 01:40:07.400 align:start position:0%
owner's hands to decide what energy
 
01:40:09.750 --> 01:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
efficient level they want to go if they
 
01:40:12.790 --> 01:40:12.800 align:start position:0%
can justify it cost incentive wise
 
01:40:15.430 --> 01:40:15.440 align:start position:0%
they're going to do it if it cost too
 
01:40:17.629 --> 01:40:17.639 align:start position:0%
much or doesn't fit their plan we don't
 
01:40:20.109 --> 01:40:20.119 align:start position:0%
want to stop their project I represent
 
01:40:21.589 --> 01:40:21.599 align:start position:0%
contractors that want to build these
 
01:40:23.390 --> 01:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
projects so they don't want to be a
 
01:40:26.310 --> 01:40:26.320 align:start position:0%
hindrance but they also they want the
 
01:40:28.470 --> 01:40:28.480 align:start position:0%
owner to have the opportunity whether
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
it's the state of New Hampshire is the
 
01:40:32.990 --> 01:40:33.000 align:start position:0%
owner or whether it's a private company
 
01:40:35.109 --> 01:40:35.119 align:start position:0%
so we're looking at the energy code we
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
support the building code review board
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
building code review board recommended
 
01:40:42.510 --> 01:40:42.520 align:start position:0%
the original bill I think if you want to
 
01:40:44.550 --> 01:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
go further with the energy code I feel
 
01:40:46.270 --> 01:40:46.280 align:start position:0%
like it's kind of being slipped in
 
01:40:47.830 --> 01:40:47.840 align:start position:0%
without all that other
 
01:40:50.109 --> 01:40:50.119 align:start position:0%
consideration and that to me could be
 
01:40:52.189 --> 01:40:52.199 align:start position:0%
problematic over over the next few years
 
01:40:53.790 --> 01:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
if you don't look at all the Amendments
 
01:40:56.030 --> 01:40:56.040 align:start position:0%
that should be done but that's my
 
01:40:59.669 --> 01:40:59.679 align:start position:0%
testimony that we support the original
 
01:41:02.430 --> 01:41:02.440 align:start position:0%
Bill we don't think the energy code
 
01:41:05.310 --> 01:41:05.320 align:start position:0%
should just be slid in it's not the same
 
01:41:07.430 --> 01:41:07.440 align:start position:0%
and it's a much different animal when
 
01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:10.040 align:start position:0%
you're talking about Energy
 
01:41:11.750 --> 01:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
Efficiency thank thank you for your
 
01:41:13.109 --> 01:41:13.119 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions
 
01:41:13.119 --> 01:41:14.550 align:start position:0%
testimony are there any questions
representative

01:41:14.550 --> 01:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:17.589 --> 01:41:17.599 align:start position:0%
grto thank you U Mr Abbott are there any
 
01:41:20.430 --> 01:41:20.440 align:start position:0%
parts of the energy code that you think
 
01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:23.520 align:start position:0%
that you're commercial Builders might
 
01:41:27.589 --> 01:41:27.599 align:start position:0%
find beneficial for the industry yeah I
 
01:41:29.750 --> 01:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
don't think it's unan I don't think we
 
01:41:33.390 --> 01:41:33.400 align:start position:0%
unilaterally oppose everything in the
 
01:41:36.629 --> 01:41:36.639 align:start position:0%
code but when you don't want to update
 
01:41:38.790 --> 01:41:38.800 align:start position:0%
the code and have so many amendments it
 
01:41:41.510 --> 01:41:41.520 align:start position:0%
makes it useless that more than 50%
 
01:41:43.950 --> 01:41:43.960 align:start position:0%
you're removing there's a there's a
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
conflict there when you start to do that
 
01:41:47.470 --> 01:41:47.480 align:start position:0%
you're ended up writing so many
 
01:41:49.390 --> 01:41:49.400 align:start position:0%
amendments it doesn't make sense but I
 
01:41:51.310 --> 01:41:51.320 align:start position:0%
won't say that every part of the code
 
01:41:54.430 --> 01:41:54.440 align:start position:0%
isn't a good thing I will add this and I
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
I kind of skipped it when that code for
 
01:42:01.350 --> 01:42:01.360 align:start position:0%
2021 was done was before the inflation
 
01:42:03.270 --> 01:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
rate mortgage
 
01:42:06.709 --> 01:42:06.719 align:start position:0%
increase so whatever they use to cost
 
01:42:08.669 --> 01:42:08.679 align:start position:0%
justify this is what happens in the
 
01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
energy code they they recommend a better
 
01:42:15.149 --> 01:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
unit for heating than what is allowed in
 
01:42:17.350 --> 01:42:17.360 align:start position:0%
the 18 they all they say something
 
01:42:20.870 --> 01:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
higher well they do a payback and I've
 
01:42:22.470 --> 01:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
always argued I sometimes think their
 
01:42:25.229 --> 01:42:25.239 align:start position:0%
payback is too long they might pick 10
 
01:42:27.629 --> 01:42:27.639 align:start position:0%
years if you put the new interest rate
 
01:42:31.470 --> 01:42:31.480 align:start position:0%
to it that 10 years may be 15 or 20 and
 
01:42:33.870 --> 01:42:33.880 align:start position:0%
I start to question whether that is a
 
01:42:37.950 --> 01:42:37.960 align:start position:0%
good payback period for that equipment
 
01:42:39.950 --> 01:42:39.960 align:start position:0%
so that's part of the problem the other
 
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
thing that happened is with
 
01:42:45.910 --> 01:42:45.920 align:start position:0%
Co is some products are less in Supply
 
01:42:47.510 --> 01:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
today than they are than they were
 
01:42:50.229 --> 01:42:50.239 align:start position:0%
before when that code was made not
 
01:42:53.510 --> 01:42:53.520 align:start position:0%
everything is produced uh at the same
 
01:42:55.589 --> 01:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
level contractors have fought about
 
01:42:58.350 --> 01:42:58.360 align:start position:0%
getting certain types of equipment to to
 
01:43:00.790 --> 01:43:00.800 align:start position:0%
comply with Energy Efficiency and other
 
01:43:03.669 --> 01:43:03.679 align:start position:0%
things so understand there's a lot more
 
01:43:07.270 --> 01:43:07.280 align:start position:0%
Dynamics to this uh energy code follow
 
01:43:09.070 --> 01:43:09.080 align:start position:0%
up thank
 
01:43:12.470 --> 01:43:12.480 align:start position:0%
you so a couple of years ago maybe two
 
01:43:15.669 --> 01:43:15.679 align:start position:0%
or three years ago and my memory is I
 
01:43:17.669 --> 01:43:17.679 align:start position:0%
can't quite remember what year that was
 
01:43:21.350 --> 01:43:21.360 align:start position:0%
but we did look at the energy um
 
01:43:23.990 --> 01:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
um codes and we did I remember make
 
01:43:26.910 --> 01:43:26.920 align:start position:0%
amendments that included that do you
 
01:43:28.750 --> 01:43:28.760 align:start position:0%
recall what those were well we we made
 
01:43:30.149 --> 01:43:30.159 align:start position:0%
amendments and it would be in the
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
building code review board's items I
 
01:43:34.510 --> 01:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
mean I was involved in one Amendment for
 
01:43:36.350 --> 01:43:36.360 align:start position:0%
a commercial but there were other
 
01:43:39.750 --> 01:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
amendments so the 2018 does have
 
01:43:42.070 --> 01:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
amendments to it what I'm saying is to
 
01:43:43.270 --> 01:43:43.280 align:start position:0%
put in the
 
01:43:45.870 --> 01:43:45.880 align:start position:0%
2021 somebody's got to do a complete
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
review of the 2021 of what amendments
 
01:43:51.229 --> 01:43:51.239 align:start position:0%
would have to go in now the building
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
code review board started that process
 
01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:55.239 align:start position:0%
and they ended up voting let's not
 
01:43:57.510 --> 01:43:57.520 align:start position:0%
update the code because it has such an
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
impact that's what I want to leave you
 
01:44:02.270 --> 01:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
with that it's nice to talk about we're
 
01:44:04.790 --> 01:44:04.800 align:start position:0%
GNA help the environment I get that
 
01:44:07.149 --> 01:44:07.159 align:start position:0%
whole thing we all want to do that but
 
01:44:09.950 --> 01:44:09.960 align:start position:0%
there's a cost associated with those
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
improvements and what is a reasonable
 
01:44:15.830 --> 01:44:15.840 align:start position:0%
payback you have to look at the whole
 
01:44:19.350 --> 01:44:19.360 align:start position:0%
thing thank you representative
 
01:44:22.350 --> 01:44:22.360 align:start position:0%
Bailey hi I I'm seeking a clarification
 
01:44:24.270 --> 01:44:24.280 align:start position:0%
I guess the bill and the amendment would
 
01:44:26.430 --> 01:44:26.440 align:start position:0%
seem to be exactly the same including
 
01:44:28.350 --> 01:44:28.360 align:start position:0%
the energy code and the only thing
 
01:44:31.589 --> 01:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
that's different is the Amendments
 
01:44:34.390 --> 01:44:34.400 align:start position:0%
applied in general it doesn't really say
 
01:44:37.510 --> 01:44:37.520 align:start position:0%
to what between September 8th 20123 and
 
01:44:37.520 --> 01:44:38.910 align:start position:0%
to what between September 8th 20123 and
January

01:44:38.910 --> 01:44:38.920 align:start position:0%
January
 
01:44:42.270 --> 01:44:42.280 align:start position:0%
2024 are those amendments to that 2018
 
01:44:45.270 --> 01:44:45.280 align:start position:0%
energy code I I think that would be best
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
left to the chairman of the building
 
01:44:49.430 --> 01:44:49.440 align:start position:0%
code review board you know but what I'm
 
01:44:51.870 --> 01:44:51.880 align:start position:0%
saying is whatever amendments we had
 
01:44:52.830 --> 01:44:52.840 align:start position:0%
with the
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
2018 if you put in
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
2021 there are changes there are more
 
01:45:01.310 --> 01:45:01.320 align:start position:0%
possible amendments we need to do thank
 
01:45:05.470 --> 01:45:05.480 align:start position:0%
you representative man py thank you um
 
01:45:08.109 --> 01:45:08.119 align:start position:0%
Mr chair I probably should hold up for
 
01:45:10.550 --> 01:45:10.560 align:start position:0%
the subcommittee but I'll ask I was
 
01:45:12.070 --> 01:45:12.080 align:start position:0%
going to make a comment on on that
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
afterwards but yeah go ahead okay um
 
01:45:16.990 --> 01:45:17.000 align:start position:0%
just in terms of when you say clean I
 
01:45:22.430 --> 01:45:22.440 align:start position:0%
mean the energy code is more cosmetic or
 
01:45:24.149 --> 01:45:24.159 align:start position:0%
at more
 
01:45:28.589 --> 01:45:28.599 align:start position:0%
costly but structurally it
 
01:45:32.750 --> 01:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
affects because if we have the load on
 
01:45:37.109 --> 01:45:37.119 align:start position:0%
the roof if you cannot put
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
rooftop solar and the loadbearing and
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
the snow amount all those things have a
 
01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
huge impact on how we do the
 
01:45:50.030 --> 01:45:50.040 align:start position:0%
conservation and Energy Efficiency and
 
01:45:53.629 --> 01:45:53.639 align:start position:0%
you can't rule that out as a safety
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
issue I I think I just want to clarify
 
01:45:58.750 --> 01:45:58.760 align:start position:0%
snow loads is not part of the energy
 
01:46:01.589 --> 01:46:01.599 align:start position:0%
code so we're in support
 
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
of the current code or whatever
 
01:46:08.189 --> 01:46:08.199 align:start position:0%
amendments to that energ that snow load
 
01:46:10.189 --> 01:46:10.199 align:start position:0%
is so I don't think it's related to the
 
01:46:10.199 --> 01:46:11.350 align:start position:0%
is so I don't think it's related to the
energy

01:46:11.350 --> 01:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
energy
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
code uh before we move on just a couple
 
01:46:15.990 --> 01:46:16.000 align:start position:0%
of points of clarification uh first off
 
01:46:17.470 --> 01:46:17.480 align:start position:0%
I would like to say we have four pink
 
01:46:19.189 --> 01:46:19.199 align:start position:0%
cards left on this particular Bill we're
 
01:46:20.550 --> 01:46:20.560 align:start position:0%
already running over I want to make sure
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
that the people who want to testify have
 
01:46:24.510 --> 01:46:24.520 align:start position:0%
ample time to do that this morning this
 
01:46:26.109 --> 01:46:26.119 align:start position:0%
is going to subcommittee so if the
 
01:46:28.070 --> 01:46:28.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee could really
 
01:46:29.629 --> 01:46:29.639 align:start position:0%
gauge carefully whether or not those
 
01:46:31.310 --> 01:46:31.320 align:start position:0%
questions need to be asked here or if
 
01:46:32.510 --> 01:46:32.520 align:start position:0%
they can wait until the subcommittee
 
01:46:34.390 --> 01:46:34.400 align:start position:0%
that would be beneficial also when it
 
01:46:37.430 --> 01:46:37.440 align:start position:0%
comes to the Amendments um and chair
 
01:46:39.109 --> 01:46:39.119 align:start position:0%
McGuire can probably clarify if I'm
 
01:46:42.629 --> 01:46:42.639 align:start position:0%
wrong uh her Amendment changes the um
 
01:46:44.070 --> 01:46:44.080 align:start position:0%
effective date of the amendments to
 
01:46:46.350 --> 01:46:46.360 align:start position:0%
January 12th is but she wanted to have
 
01:46:48.790 --> 01:46:48.800 align:start position:0%
discussion correct on the energy
 
01:46:50.030 --> 01:46:50.040 align:start position:0%
component of it it's not part of the
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
amendment itself I asked for two
 
01:46:55.589 --> 01:46:55.599 align:start position:0%
amendments and only got one and this is
 
01:46:58.109 --> 01:46:58.119 align:start position:0%
the wrong wrong one it does not update
 
01:47:01.229 --> 01:47:01.239 align:start position:0%
the energy code but we will in fact
 
01:47:03.709 --> 01:47:03.719 align:start position:0%
discuss it in subcommittee we don't need
 
01:47:06.109 --> 01:47:06.119 align:start position:0%
another amendment great so um having
 
01:47:07.390 --> 01:47:07.400 align:start position:0%
said that I think there was one more
 
01:47:09.950 --> 01:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
question representative go thank you Mr
 
01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
chair and I'm not sure who's best to
 
01:47:14.189 --> 01:47:14.199 align:start position:0%
answer this and I think the answer can
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
come to the subcommittee but for
 
01:47:18.350 --> 01:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
everybody and you included uh my
 
01:47:20.510 --> 01:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
question has to do with when would
 
01:47:23.669 --> 01:47:23.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the cost impact on these
 
01:47:28.149 --> 01:47:28.159 align:start position:0%
things um is the cost of the changes is
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
the cost of the harm to the environment
 
01:47:33.189 --> 01:47:33.199 align:start position:0%
created by not adopting some of these
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
changes figured in and and if not is
 
01:47:38.350 --> 01:47:38.360 align:start position:0%
there a recognition that perhaps that's
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
something this committee needs to look
 
01:47:41.629 --> 01:47:41.639 align:start position:0%
at over and above what the building
 
01:47:46.229 --> 01:47:46.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
that thank you so much thank
 
01:47:51.510 --> 01:47:51.520 align:start position:0%
you I apologize I'm not sure I'm going
 
01:47:53.189 --> 01:47:53.199 align:start position:0%
to get the last name right um Chris
 
01:47:56.669 --> 01:47:56.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:56.679 --> 01:48:11.910 align:start position:0%
 
Hampshire

01:48:11.910 --> 01:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.950 --> 01:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
awesome all right U thank you Mr chair
 
01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
or acting chair thank you members of the
 
01:48:17.950 --> 01:48:17.960 align:start position:0%
committee it's good to see many of you
 
01:48:20.950 --> 01:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
again uh this is my ninth year
 
01:48:24.030 --> 01:48:24.040 align:start position:0%
commenting on the building tax not tax
 
01:48:27.669 --> 01:48:27.679 align:start position:0%
code it's tax time uh the building code
 
01:48:29.229 --> 01:48:29.239 align:start position:0%
and specifically the building energy
 
01:48:32.149 --> 01:48:32.159 align:start position:0%
code um so my name is Chris scogland I'm
 
01:48:34.070 --> 01:48:34.080 align:start position:0%
with clean energy New Hampshire a little
 
01:48:35.790 --> 01:48:35.800 align:start position:0%
bit about us we're often confused as a
 
01:48:38.430 --> 01:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
trade group related to solar in fact we
 
01:48:40.510 --> 01:48:40.520 align:start position:0%
have more than 40 members at this point
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
uh that are municipalities representing
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
about 430,000 uh residents of the state
 
01:48:48.390 --> 01:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
which is approximately 30% of the
 
01:48:50.870 --> 01:48:50.880 align:start position:0%
state's population that's in addition to
 
01:48:52.030 --> 01:48:52.040 align:start position:0%
the solar providers that everyone
 
01:48:53.870 --> 01:48:53.880 align:start position:0%
assumes we represent as well as numerous
 
01:48:56.830 --> 01:48:56.840 align:start position:0%
manufacturers businesses and individual
 
01:48:59.030 --> 01:48:59.040 align:start position:0%
members we also include among our
 
01:49:01.189 --> 01:49:01.199 align:start position:0%
membership the three regulated utilities
 
01:49:04.030 --> 01:49:04.040 align:start position:0%
eversource Liberty and Unitil and so we
 
01:49:06.390 --> 01:49:06.400 align:start position:0%
work across a large number of areas I
 
01:49:08.310 --> 01:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
personally work um managing a group
 
01:49:12.070 --> 01:49:12.080 align:start position:0%
related to energy and grid issues um
 
01:49:13.950 --> 01:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
some of which have come up today as well
 
01:49:15.910 --> 01:49:15.920 align:start position:0%
as a group uh called Drive Electric New
 
01:49:17.790 --> 01:49:17.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire focused on electric vehicles
 
01:49:19.189 --> 01:49:19.199 align:start position:0%
and then I'm very heavily involved in
 
01:49:20.589 --> 01:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
the state's energy effic efficiency
 
01:49:22.750 --> 01:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
programs principally New Hampshire saves
 
01:49:23.910 --> 01:49:23.920 align:start position:0%
but then looking into how do we
 
01:49:26.470 --> 01:49:26.480 align:start position:0%
integrate heat pumps with the grid and
 
01:49:30.589 --> 01:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
with batteries and electric vehicles so
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
we oppose the bill as written and
 
01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
support the bill as amended um with the
 
01:49:40.510 --> 01:49:40.520 align:start position:0%
amendment today um I will save comments
 
01:49:42.229 --> 01:49:42.239 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee if we're hopefully
 
01:49:43.709 --> 01:49:43.719 align:start position:0%
able to attend that because I know we're
 
01:49:45.070 --> 01:49:45.080 align:start position:0%
running late there are other people that
 
01:49:47.350 --> 01:49:47.360 align:start position:0%
want to speak but I would generally note
 
01:49:50.990 --> 01:49:51.000 align:start position:0%
that uh we would encourage enourage you
 
01:49:54.790 --> 01:49:54.800 align:start position:0%
to deeply litigate the testimony that
 
01:49:56.990 --> 01:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
the home builders provided uh the
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
analysis that they did was um was in
 
01:50:02.830 --> 01:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
fact an analysis of what the costs might
 
01:50:04.510 --> 01:50:04.520 align:start position:0%
be but they were not specific to New
 
01:50:06.990 --> 01:50:07.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the Pacific Northwest National
 
01:50:09.189 --> 01:50:09.199 align:start position:0%
Labs which is associated with the US
 
01:50:11.750 --> 01:50:11.760 align:start position:0%
Department of energy did a similar study
 
01:50:14.310 --> 01:50:14.320 align:start position:0%
but they actually evaluated a much more
 
01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:16.159 align:start position:0%
accurate depiction of what New
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's energy is like uh where they
 
01:50:20.629 --> 01:50:20.639 align:start position:0%
included Electric
 
01:50:23.589 --> 01:50:23.599 align:start position:0%
as well as oil natural gas
 
01:50:27.149 --> 01:50:27.159 align:start position:0%
and uh I think propane and they
 
01:50:29.350 --> 01:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
distributed that across the buildings to
 
01:50:30.910 --> 01:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
represent how buildings are actually
 
01:50:32.629 --> 01:50:32.639 align:start position:0%
built in this state the New Hampshire
 
01:50:34.189 --> 01:50:34.199 align:start position:0%
Home Builders was a national survey
 
01:50:35.550 --> 01:50:35.560 align:start position:0%
where the closest I think we could get
 
01:50:38.229 --> 01:50:38.239 align:start position:0%
to New Hampshire was Chicago and then
 
01:50:41.629 --> 01:50:41.639 align:start position:0%
Montana for the the homes they built and
 
01:50:43.149 --> 01:50:43.159 align:start position:0%
they only looked at electric resistance
 
01:50:46.870 --> 01:50:46.880 align:start position:0%
heat and uh natural gas we do not have a
 
01:50:48.229 --> 01:50:48.239 align:start position:0%
significant amount of natural gas in the
 
01:50:50.189 --> 01:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
state so the comparisons that they did
 
01:50:54.270 --> 01:50:54.280 align:start position:0%
versus the natural the doe lab uh study
 
01:50:57.629 --> 01:50:57.639 align:start position:0%
should be investigated also the $30,000
 
01:51:00.270 --> 01:51:00.280 align:start position:0%
number that uh was shared I would be
 
01:51:02.069 --> 01:51:02.079 align:start position:0%
interested to see all of the details
 
01:51:03.910 --> 01:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
related to that because the best I can
 
01:51:07.470 --> 01:51:07.480 align:start position:0%
see is that there's $8,000 that might be
 
01:51:09.149 --> 01:51:09.159 align:start position:0%
attributable to the code but then
 
01:51:11.390 --> 01:51:11.400 align:start position:0%
there's an additional optional package
 
01:51:13.589 --> 01:51:13.599 align:start position:0%
that could be added in adding between 8
 
01:51:16.950 --> 01:51:16.960 align:start position:0%
and $12,000 again uh I think there's
 
01:51:18.270 --> 01:51:18.280 align:start position:0%
more information that we would love to
 
01:51:20.910 --> 01:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
see our general concern is that we are
 
01:51:22.950 --> 01:51:22.960 align:start position:0%
repeating a pattern that I saw first in
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
2015 in 2015 the building code review
 
01:51:28.149 --> 01:51:28.159 align:start position:0%
board adopted or recommended for
 
01:51:32.109 --> 01:51:32.119 align:start position:0%
ratification by this body the 2015 iecc
 
01:51:33.709 --> 01:51:33.719 align:start position:0%
so the energy code with all the other
 
01:51:37.589 --> 01:51:37.599 align:start position:0%
caches it was derailed by concerns
 
01:51:39.830 --> 01:51:39.840 align:start position:0%
largely from the building community in
 
01:51:42.229 --> 01:51:42.239 align:start position:0%
this committee we did not move to a new
 
01:51:44.990 --> 01:51:45.000 align:start position:0%
code of any type until 2019 the
 
01:51:46.950 --> 01:51:46.960 align:start position:0%
Amendments that were made that we we
 
01:51:48.910 --> 01:51:48.920 align:start position:0%
keep calling carry forward amendments
 
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
were a part of the negotiation to kind
 
01:51:53.910 --> 01:51:53.920 align:start position:0%
of meet in the middle so we could move
 
01:51:56.270 --> 01:51:56.280 align:start position:0%
up to a more modern code but we had
 
01:51:58.470 --> 01:51:58.480 align:start position:0%
missed significant number of years
 
01:52:00.629 --> 01:52:00.639 align:start position:0%
between we moved from a 2009 code to a
 
01:52:03.669 --> 01:52:03.679 align:start position:0%
2015 code big jumps in efficiency but we
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
had thousands upon thousands of
 
01:52:07.790 --> 01:52:07.800 align:start position:0%
buildings that were built the problem is
 
01:52:09.069 --> 01:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
we have What's called the split
 
01:52:11.589 --> 01:52:11.599 align:start position:0%
incentive where the costs may be felt
 
01:52:13.030 --> 01:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
principally by the builders and they
 
01:52:15.870 --> 01:52:15.880 align:start position:0%
have to pass them on to occupants
 
01:52:19.350 --> 01:52:19.360 align:start position:0%
whether they are renters um or
 
01:52:22.669 --> 01:52:22.679 align:start position:0%
homeowners like myself and those costs
 
01:52:24.390 --> 01:52:24.400 align:start position:0%
are something where the beneficiary is
 
01:52:26.030 --> 01:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
not felt by the first party to Bear the
 
01:52:28.470 --> 01:52:28.480 align:start position:0%
costs there is this argument that well
 
01:52:30.950 --> 01:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
any homeowner or any commercial building
 
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
occupant can ask for a higher code to be
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
built to but I'm not sure how many
 
01:52:38.310 --> 01:52:38.320 align:start position:0%
people are Contracting to have their
 
01:52:40.350 --> 01:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
homes built um from everyone that I've
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
seen move into the state uh in the past
 
01:52:44.229 --> 01:52:44.239 align:start position:0%
if they're moving into new buildings
 
01:52:45.589 --> 01:52:45.599 align:start position:0%
it's all stuff that they found on the
 
01:52:46.669 --> 01:52:46.679 align:start position:0%
side of the road when they were driving
 
01:52:47.990 --> 01:52:48.000 align:start position:0%
around with a real estate agent they
 
01:52:49.830 --> 01:52:49.840 align:start position:0%
weren't moving in and having designed
 
01:52:51.950 --> 01:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
built for themselves so they don't have
 
01:52:55.550 --> 01:52:55.560 align:start position:0%
that choice I also question the
 
01:52:57.229 --> 01:52:57.239 align:start position:0%
expertise that we are expecting of
 
01:52:59.550 --> 01:52:59.560 align:start position:0%
homeowners or any building occupants we
 
01:53:01.229 --> 01:53:01.239 align:start position:0%
don't expect them to make choices about
 
01:53:03.350 --> 01:53:03.360 align:start position:0%
their Plumbing their electrical their
 
01:53:05.189 --> 01:53:05.199 align:start position:0%
fire code all of these critical Life
 
01:53:06.830 --> 01:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
Safety things but when it comes to
 
01:53:09.069 --> 01:53:09.079 align:start position:0%
choosing the right heating insulation
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
and um in addition to countertops and
 
01:53:15.430 --> 01:53:15.440 align:start position:0%
interior design we leave that to them
 
01:53:18.229 --> 01:53:18.239 align:start position:0%
but the problem is um we expect that the
 
01:53:20.189 --> 01:53:20.199 align:start position:0%
new building code is about 15% % more
 
01:53:22.229 --> 01:53:22.239 align:start position:0%
efficient and so we are leaving a
 
01:53:24.629 --> 01:53:24.639 align:start position:0%
significant amount of energy savings on
 
01:53:26.470 --> 01:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
the table and it does connect to the
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
grid it connects to resilience I
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
wouldn't look to Texas for any energy
 
01:53:33.030 --> 01:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
code because as we saw from the storm
 
01:53:34.790 --> 01:53:34.800 align:start position:0%
Yuri a few years ago a lot of people
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
froze and died because they did not have
 
01:53:39.030 --> 01:53:39.040 align:start position:0%
homes that were prepared for extreme
 
01:53:41.470 --> 01:53:41.480 align:start position:0%
conditions we also have conditions that
 
01:53:43.310 --> 01:53:43.320 align:start position:0%
are more prepared I'm sorry I'm starting
 
01:53:44.550 --> 01:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
a rant and I said I was going to be
 
01:53:47.350 --> 01:53:47.360 align:start position:0%
short I will cut it out there look
 
01:53:48.550 --> 01:53:48.560 align:start position:0%
forward to speaking with you all at the
 
01:53:50.109 --> 01:53:50.119 align:start position:0%

questions have indoor
 
01:53:59.790 --> 01:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
yeah not like the barbecue indoors thank
 
01:54:00.990 --> 01:54:01.000 align:start position:0%

of New Hampshire opposes this bill House
 
01:54:40.510 --> 01:54:40.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 1059 um we do support the amendment
 
01:54:42.550 --> 01:54:42.560 align:start position:0%
that was introduced and proposed by
 
01:54:44.069 --> 01:54:44.079 align:start position:0%
representative Mick
 
01:54:46.830 --> 01:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
Williams um just a little bit about
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
cbcn um we are a governmental instrument
 
01:54:52.109 --> 01:54:52.119 align:start position:0%
mentality created to serve our member
 
01:54:54.629 --> 01:54:54.639 align:start position:0%
Municipal jurisdictions and their energy
 
01:54:57.069 --> 01:54:57.079 align:start position:0%
consumers pursuant to a joint Powers
 
01:55:00.669 --> 01:55:00.679 align:start position:0%
agreement under rsa's 53a and
 
01:55:03.629 --> 01:55:03.639 align:start position:0%
53e we're currently comprised of 55
 
01:55:05.990 --> 01:55:06.000 align:start position:0%
member municipalities including six
 
01:55:09.470 --> 01:55:09.480 align:start position:0%
cities 47 towns and two counties from
 
01:55:12.390 --> 01:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
across the state right now we represent
 
01:55:14.910 --> 01:55:14.920 align:start position:0%
about 30% of the state's
 
01:55:17.510 --> 01:55:17.520 align:start position:0%
population last spring we launched our
 
01:55:20.350 --> 01:55:20.360 align:start position:0%
first 14 Community power aggregation
 
01:55:23.270 --> 01:55:23.280 align:start position:0%
serving 80,000 customers and the first 7
 
01:55:25.510 --> 01:55:25.520 align:start position:0%
months of operation we saved our
 
01:55:28.510 --> 01:55:28.520 align:start position:0%
customers $8 million while creating $5
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
million in joint Financial
 
01:55:33.350 --> 01:55:33.360 align:start position:0%
reserves last month we announced a rate
 
01:55:36.589 --> 01:55:36.599 align:start position:0%
decrease to 8.1 cents per kilowatt hour
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
lower than any of the utility default
 
01:55:41.550 --> 01:55:41.560 align:start position:0%
Service rates between March and June of
 
01:55:43.790 --> 01:55:43.800 align:start position:0%
this year we will be launching two do
 
01:55:46.149 --> 01:55:46.159 align:start position:0%
more Community power aggregations which
 
01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
will put cpcn in the position of being
 
01:55:50.589 --> 01:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
the second largest power supplier in the
 
01:55:53.790 --> 01:55:53.800 align:start position:0%
state um I share this uh to provide
 
01:55:55.950 --> 01:55:55.960 align:start position:0%
context for how Community power is
 
01:55:57.790 --> 01:55:57.800 align:start position:0%
transforming retail electricity in the
 
01:56:00.629 --> 01:56:00.639 align:start position:0%
granite state and um I hope to connect
 
01:56:03.189 --> 01:56:03.199 align:start position:0%
why um updated building energy codes are
 
01:56:05.950 --> 01:56:05.960 align:start position:0%
really essential in um maximizing value
 
01:56:07.149 --> 01:56:07.159 align:start position:0%
for energy
 
01:56:09.990 --> 01:56:10.000 align:start position:0%
consumers cbcn supports increasing
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
Innovation through local control equity
 
01:56:14.709 --> 01:56:14.719 align:start position:0%
and Community Development unfortunately
 
01:56:16.950 --> 01:56:16.960 align:start position:0%
not adopting the most recent addition of
 
01:56:18.990 --> 01:56:19.000 align:start position:0%
the building energy code as this bill
 
01:56:21.390 --> 01:56:21.400 align:start position:0%
proposes would pass these costs on to
 
01:56:23.390 --> 01:56:23.400 align:start position:0%
consumers in the form of higher energy
 
01:56:25.669 --> 01:56:25.679 align:start position:0%
bills over the time that they own or
 
01:56:28.229 --> 01:56:28.239 align:start position:0%
rent that home or building often these
 
01:56:31.350 --> 01:56:31.360 align:start position:0%
costs are Bor borne by fixed low and
 
01:56:33.550 --> 01:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
moderate income households creating an
 
01:56:34.990 --> 01:56:35.000 align:start position:0%
unfair energy
 
01:56:38.790 --> 01:56:38.800 align:start position:0%
burden as cbcn looks to grow and evolve
 
01:56:41.189 --> 01:56:41.199 align:start position:0%
and offer additional value added
 
01:56:43.270 --> 01:56:43.280 align:start position:0%
programs and services Beyond Simple
 
01:56:45.229 --> 01:56:45.239 align:start position:0%
commodity of electricity to our
 
01:56:47.669 --> 01:56:47.679 align:start position:0%
consumers having current building energy
 
01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
codes will be important to maximize that
 
01:56:53.270 --> 01:56:53.280 align:start position:0%
investment uh in a future with increased
 
01:56:55.069 --> 01:56:55.079 align:start position:0%
efficient or beneficial
 
01:56:57.830 --> 01:56:57.840 align:start position:0%
electrification um including through
 
01:57:00.069 --> 01:57:00.079 align:start position:0%
electric heat pumps and electric heat
 
01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
pump water heaters Uh current building
 
01:57:04.109 --> 01:57:04.119 align:start position:0%
codes will will promote greater
 
01:57:06.310 --> 01:57:06.320 align:start position:0%
efficiency comfort and productivity for
 
01:57:09.550 --> 01:57:09.560 align:start position:0%
building occupants um believe as Chris
 
01:57:11.790 --> 01:57:11.800 align:start position:0%
pointed out um it's far more expensive
 
01:57:14.390 --> 01:57:14.400 align:start position:0%
to retrofit a home or building after the
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
fact then during its design and
 
01:57:16.480 --> 01:57:17.629 align:start position:0%
fact then during its design and
construction

01:57:17.629 --> 01:57:17.639 align:start position:0%
construction
 
01:57:20.109 --> 01:57:20.119 align:start position:0%
phase uh we also view the bill as part
 
01:57:22.189 --> 01:57:22.199 align:start position:0%
of a broader context right now your
 
01:57:23.910 --> 01:57:23.920 align:start position:0%
colleagues in the Senate are considering
 
01:57:26.669 --> 01:57:26.679 align:start position:0%
a bill Senate Bill 437 that would make
 
01:57:29.069 --> 01:57:29.079 align:start position:0%
it much harder for municipalities to
 
01:57:31.709 --> 01:57:31.719 align:start position:0%
adopt more stringent building codes uh
 
01:57:33.310 --> 01:57:33.320 align:start position:0%
the impacts of that bill would make it
 
01:57:35.430 --> 01:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible for a community to
 
01:57:37.589 --> 01:57:37.599 align:start position:0%
adopt the newest building energy code
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
which in combination with this bill
 
01:57:42.470 --> 01:57:42.480 align:start position:0%
could constrain communities to the 2018
 
01:57:44.750 --> 01:57:44.760 align:start position:0%
edition of the energy code um as the
 
01:57:44.760 --> 01:57:45.950 align:start position:0%
edition of the energy code um as the
floor

01:57:45.950 --> 01:57:45.960 align:start position:0%
floor
 
01:57:48.709 --> 01:57:48.719 align:start position:0%
indefinitely uh also wanted to mention
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
to you that that New Hampshire has
 
01:57:53.390 --> 01:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
access to as much as $4 million in
 
01:57:55.229 --> 01:57:55.239 align:start position:0%
Formula funds through the federal
 
01:57:58.069 --> 01:57:58.079 align:start position:0%
inflation reduction act uh These funds
 
01:58:00.149 --> 01:58:00.159 align:start position:0%
would support implementation of the most
 
01:58:02.950 --> 01:58:02.960 align:start position:0%
current building energy codes for local
 
01:58:04.990 --> 01:58:05.000 align:start position:0%
governments the opportunity to apply for
 
01:58:07.990 --> 01:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
these funds would be foreclosed if the
 
01:58:10.270 --> 01:58:10.280 align:start position:0%
state does not adopt the 2021 addition
 
01:58:12.390 --> 01:58:12.400 align:start position:0%
of the International Energy conver
 
01:58:15.990 --> 01:58:16.000 align:start position:0%
conservation code um as as proposed in
 
01:58:18.229 --> 01:58:18.239 align:start position:0%
this bill and those communities would be
 
01:58:20.390 --> 01:58:20.400 align:start position:0%
prevented from moving on their own if
 
01:58:22.790 --> 01:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
that other bill was passed um so thank
 
01:58:24.109 --> 01:58:24.119 align:start position:0%
you for your time and attention look
 
01:58:25.830 --> 01:58:25.840 align:start position:0%
forward to any questions and also
 
01:58:27.189 --> 01:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
working with the
 
01:58:28.990 --> 01:58:29.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee any questions yes
 
01:58:31.390 --> 01:58:31.400 align:start position:0%
representative go just quickly um was
 
01:58:32.510 --> 01:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:58:36.750 --> 01:58:36.760 align:start position:0%
2021 code or the 2024 code that would
 
01:58:40.030 --> 01:58:40.040 align:start position:0%
open up that that funding stream my
 
01:58:41.550 --> 01:58:41.560 align:start position:0%
understanding is it would need to be at
 
01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
least the 2021
 
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
Edition representative
 
01:58:47.750 --> 01:58:47.760 align:start position:0%
man thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:58:52.350 --> 01:58:52.360 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh does the 2018 code
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
for clean energy building you know it's
 
01:58:58.149 --> 01:58:58.159 align:start position:0%
a part of the building part of uh
 
01:59:01.830 --> 01:59:01.840 align:start position:0%
commercial development does that include
 
01:59:05.149 --> 01:59:05.159 align:start position:0%
any regulations for Passive buildings
 
01:59:08.990 --> 01:59:09.000 align:start position:0%
which reduces the energy conservation to
 
01:59:13.629 --> 01:59:13.639 align:start position:0%
I mean energy use to 40% plus um are you
 
01:59:16.750 --> 01:59:16.760 align:start position:0%
aware of that passive buildings green
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
buildings that built from scratch up
 
01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:21.189 align:start position:0%
buildings that built from scratch up
would

01:59:21.189 --> 01:59:21.199 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:59:23.390 --> 01:59:23.400 align:start position:0%
reduce um thank you for the question
 
01:59:25.149 --> 01:59:25.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I that is a little bit
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
beyond my expertise so I would defer
 
01:59:30.510 --> 01:59:30.520 align:start position:0%
that to one of my colleagues uh thank
 
01:59:33.550 --> 01:59:33.560 align:start position:0%
you anyone else seeing none thank you
 
01:59:36.550 --> 01:59:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.870 --> 01:59:39.880 align:start position:0%
testimony uh Ted Evans speaking in
 
01:59:46.709 --> 01:59:46.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:48.830 --> 01:59:48.840 align:start position:0%
bill morning could you turn your mic on
 
01:59:50.109 --> 01:59:50.119 align:start position:0%
for us
 
01:59:51.910 --> 01:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank you good morning members of the
 
01:59:53.750 --> 01:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
committee Mr chair uh thanks for letting
 
01:59:56.069 --> 01:59:56.079 align:start position:0%
me speak I'll try to be very brief but
 
01:59:57.430 --> 01:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
I'm trying to come at this from a
 
01:59:59.069 --> 01:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
different angle first of all I do
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
support the amendment the amended
 
02:00:03.510 --> 02:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
version of the bill and uh a little
 
02:00:06.750 --> 02:00:06.760 align:start position:0%
background um I'm from code enforcement
 
02:00:09.589 --> 02:00:09.599 align:start position:0%
my job for 30 plus years was as a
 
02:00:11.709 --> 02:00:11.719 align:start position:0%
building code and a plumbing
 
02:00:15.750 --> 02:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
code uh official so from our point of
 
02:00:18.589 --> 02:00:18.599 align:start position:0%
view anytime you have uh a difference
 
02:00:19.790 --> 02:00:19.800 align:start position:0%
such as
 
02:00:22.270 --> 02:00:22.280 align:start position:0%
all the 21 codes except the energy code
 
02:00:24.510 --> 02:00:24.520 align:start position:0%
as an 18 code it makes things more
 
02:00:27.310 --> 02:00:27.320 align:start position:0%
difficult as uh
 
02:00:30.750 --> 02:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
practitioners um and and trust me
 
02:00:33.310 --> 02:00:33.320 align:start position:0%
there's a need for competent
 
02:00:35.430 --> 02:00:35.440 align:start position:0%
practitioners out there in the field
 
02:00:36.709 --> 02:00:36.719 align:start position:0%
it's one of those fields that nobody
 
02:00:38.669 --> 02:00:38.679 align:start position:0%
wants to apply for jobs as code
 
02:00:41.750 --> 02:00:41.760 align:start position:0%
officials uh and so there is no training
 
02:00:43.950 --> 02:00:43.960 align:start position:0%
no official formal training for a code
 
02:00:46.109 --> 02:00:46.119 align:start position:0%
official so all this kind of stuff makes
 
02:00:48.550 --> 02:00:48.560 align:start position:0%
it more difficult it makes it easier for
 
02:00:50.510 --> 02:00:50.520 align:start position:0%
mistakes to to be made the way the
 
02:00:53.229 --> 02:00:53.239 align:start position:0%
internet International codes are written
 
02:00:55.149 --> 02:00:55.159 align:start position:0%
they refer to each other the plumbing
 
02:00:56.510 --> 02:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
code says you have to do something in
 
02:00:57.870 --> 02:00:57.880 align:start position:0%
accordance with the building code the
 
02:00:58.950 --> 02:00:58.960 align:start position:0%
building code says you have to do
 
02:01:00.229 --> 02:01:00.239 align:start position:0%
something in accordance with the energy
 
02:01:03.350 --> 02:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
code and they're very intertwined and so
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
then it becomes a matter of when
 
02:01:06.870 --> 02:01:06.880 align:start position:0%
something says they have to comply with
 
02:01:09.669 --> 02:01:09.679 align:start position:0%
the energy code which one and which one
 
02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
is the building code
 
02:01:14.030 --> 02:01:14.040 align:start position:0%
intending probably the one that's equal
 
02:01:17.350 --> 02:01:17.360 align:start position:0%
in addition but now we're looking at a
 
02:01:19.830 --> 02:01:19.840 align:start position:0%
reverse uh code op option with
 
02:01:21.790 --> 02:01:21.800 align:start position:0%
amendments and just I'm telling you we
 
02:01:24.270 --> 02:01:24.280 align:start position:0%
want to make things easier to be in
 
02:01:26.470 --> 02:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
compliance so that people like the Home
 
02:01:29.149 --> 02:01:29.159 align:start position:0%
Builders Association don't complain
 
02:01:31.069 --> 02:01:31.079 align:start position:0%
about inspections because the inspector
 
02:01:32.350 --> 02:01:32.360 align:start position:0%
doesn't know what he's talking about
 
02:01:34.189 --> 02:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
because we want the code to be this and
 
02:01:36.069 --> 02:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
we want it to be that it just makes the
 
02:01:40.629 --> 02:01:40.639 align:start position:0%
whole uh enforcement operation much more
 
02:01:42.470 --> 02:01:42.480 align:start position:0%
complicated much more difficult so try
 
02:01:43.990 --> 02:01:44.000 align:start position:0%
to take that into
 
02:01:46.550 --> 02:01:46.560 align:start position:0%
consideration um as a member of the
 
02:01:48.750 --> 02:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
building code review board right now I'm
 
02:01:52.030 --> 02:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
in alterate but I did um serve six years
 
02:01:54.790 --> 02:01:54.800 align:start position:0%
when it first started uh I was termed
 
02:01:56.669 --> 02:01:56.679 align:start position:0%
out at that point for two threeyear
 
02:01:59.270 --> 02:01:59.280 align:start position:0%
terms I went back on representing the
 
02:02:01.790 --> 02:02:01.800 align:start position:0%
mechanical licensing board and I was
 
02:02:04.270 --> 02:02:04.280 align:start position:0%
there for three three-year terms so I've
 
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
spent 15 years on that board and I want
 
02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
to say that the process uh for
 
02:02:14.910 --> 02:02:14.920 align:start position:0%
developing amendments is valid it's very
 
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
difficult we spent a lot of time on it
 
02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:19.440 align:start position:0%
uh and I also want to just say that the
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
chair Mr Sherman is doing a fantastic
 
02:02:25.990 --> 02:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
job and I think you should allow him
 
02:02:29.270 --> 02:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
great latitude and trust in him and what
 
02:02:31.950 --> 02:02:31.960 align:start position:0%
he's telling you and I don't think there
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
going to be any questions but I'll be
 
02:02:34.669 --> 02:02:34.679 align:start position:0%
glad to work with the subcommittee on
 
02:02:36.430 --> 02:02:36.440 align:start position:0%
this great that's been my experience
 
02:02:39.950 --> 02:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
with him as well so any questions seeing
 
02:02:42.550 --> 02:02:42.560 align:start position:0%
none thank you very
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
much uh Paul beus
 
02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
Bemus in opposition
 
02:02:52.149 --> 02:02:52.159 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your time today my name
 
02:02:55.629 --> 02:02:55.639 align:start position:0%
is uh Paul beamus and I am representing
 
02:02:58.470 --> 02:02:58.480 align:start position:0%
ashray the ashray organization today
 
02:03:00.589 --> 02:03:00.599 align:start position:0%
ashray is the American Society of
 
02:03:02.830 --> 02:03:02.840 align:start position:0%
heating Refrigeration air conditioning
 
02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:04.920 align:start position:0%
Engineers that's an organization of
 
02:03:08.030 --> 02:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
30,000 members a global organization
 
02:03:10.830 --> 02:03:10.840 align:start position:0%
that leads the codes in terms of
 
02:03:13.589 --> 02:03:13.599 align:start position:0%
research codes are derived from the work
 
02:03:15.669 --> 02:03:15.679 align:start position:0%
that ashr does in the research to
 
02:03:18.270 --> 02:03:18.280 align:start position:0%
determine uh the effectiveness of the
 
02:03:18.280 --> 02:03:19.830 align:start position:0%
determine uh the effectiveness of the
codes

02:03:19.830 --> 02:03:19.840 align:start position:0%
codes
 
02:03:22.550 --> 02:03:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh I am here today uh opposed to the
 
02:03:25.109 --> 02:03:25.119 align:start position:0%
bill as it current stands and support of
 
02:03:27.950 --> 02:03:27.960 align:start position:0%
the bill with the Amendments that uh
 
02:03:30.510 --> 02:03:30.520 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams added is
 
02:03:33.510 --> 02:03:33.520 align:start position:0%
imperative that we move to uh Energy
 
02:03:36.990 --> 02:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
Efficiency particularly the 2021 code it
 
02:03:39.669 --> 02:03:39.679 align:start position:0%
is not that arduous it is not that
 
02:03:41.069 --> 02:03:41.079 align:start position:0%
difficult we're talking here about
 
02:03:43.589 --> 02:03:43.599 align:start position:0%
insulation predominantly and we're
 
02:03:45.589 --> 02:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
talking about Vapor Barrier so that we
 
02:03:48.950 --> 02:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
can keep these buildings uh cool and
 
02:03:52.470 --> 02:03:52.480 align:start position:0%
heated properly over 40% of our energy
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
consumption worldwide goes to Heating
 
02:03:55.910 --> 02:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
and Cooling buildings it's bigger than
 
02:03:57.750 --> 02:03:57.760 align:start position:0%
Transportation it is the largest
 
02:04:00.390 --> 02:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
consumer of energy and the largest
 
02:04:03.669 --> 02:04:03.679 align:start position:0%
emitter of carbon emissions relatively a
 
02:04:05.669 --> 02:04:05.679 align:start position:0%
big portion of that over a third of it
 
02:04:08.430 --> 02:04:08.440 align:start position:0%
in our region is from heating
 
02:04:12.629 --> 02:04:12.639 align:start position:0%
alone and uh for every kilowatt or BTU
 
02:04:15.950 --> 02:04:15.960 align:start position:0%
that we put up the chimney uh we lose an
 
02:04:17.790 --> 02:04:17.800 align:start position:0%
equal amount out the sides of our
 
02:04:20.790 --> 02:04:20.800 align:start position:0%
buildings sealing them is important it's
 
02:04:22.629 --> 02:04:22.639 align:start position:0%
extremely important particularly as we
 
02:04:23.830 --> 02:04:23.840 align:start position:0%
move to
 
02:04:25.870 --> 02:04:25.880 align:start position:0%
electrification by moving from fossil
 
02:04:28.910 --> 02:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
fuels to heat pump type of source you
 
02:04:31.709 --> 02:04:31.719 align:start position:0%
get an advantage of at least four to one
 
02:04:33.830 --> 02:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
over your existing fossil fuel base
 
02:04:37.229 --> 02:04:37.239 align:start position:0%
system at least and often much higher
 
02:04:39.470 --> 02:04:39.480 align:start position:0%
and it does both Heating and
 
02:04:42.470 --> 02:04:42.480 align:start position:0%
Cooling however to make them effective
 
02:04:44.589 --> 02:04:44.599 align:start position:0%
the building envelope its instulation
 
02:04:48.390 --> 02:04:48.400 align:start position:0%
its Vapor Barrier must be secure it must
 
02:04:51.589 --> 02:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
be complete the 2021 code moves in that
 
02:04:55.270 --> 02:04:55.280 align:start position:0%
direction the 2018 code does not I would
 
02:04:57.750 --> 02:04:57.760 align:start position:0%
caution you not to consider this just as
 
02:05:00.549 --> 02:05:00.559 align:start position:0%
a return on investment or to look at it
 
02:05:03.629 --> 02:05:03.639 align:start position:0%
just from a first cost point of view
 
02:05:05.470 --> 02:05:05.480 align:start position:0%
it's easy for a builder to look at it
 
02:05:07.229 --> 02:05:07.239 align:start position:0%
from first cost point of view because
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
they leave the site and go on to the
 
02:05:12.390 --> 02:05:12.400 align:start position:0%
next project it is the homeowner or the
 
02:05:15.069 --> 02:05:15.079 align:start position:0%
building owner that gets burdened with
 
02:05:16.669 --> 02:05:16.679 align:start position:0%
the operating cost of these buildings
 
02:05:18.430 --> 02:05:18.440 align:start position:0%
for heating and cooling over the life of
 
02:05:20.709 --> 02:05:20.719 align:start position:0%
the building which we hope to be at
 
02:05:21.950 --> 02:05:21.960 align:start position:0%
least 50
 
02:05:24.549 --> 02:05:24.559 align:start position:0%
years I personally own a software
 
02:05:26.870 --> 02:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
company that does mathematical modeling
 
02:05:28.709 --> 02:05:28.719 align:start position:0%
I am an expert in building science I
 
02:05:30.109 --> 02:05:30.119 align:start position:0%
have an undergraduate in mechanical
 
02:05:31.390 --> 02:05:31.400 align:start position:0%
engineering a graduate degree in
 
02:05:33.149 --> 02:05:33.159 align:start position:0%
electrical engineering and a master's in
 
02:05:34.990 --> 02:05:35.000 align:start position:0%
business I've been in the building
 
02:05:38.149 --> 02:05:38.159 align:start position:0%
Sciences for over 30 years expert in
 
02:05:40.990 --> 02:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
mathematical modeling particularly as it
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
pertains to Thermal for highperformance
 
02:05:46.069 --> 02:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
buildings and I can tell you from the
 
02:05:47.669 --> 02:05:47.679 align:start position:0%
research done by the Builders
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
Association the study that was done
 
02:05:52.709 --> 02:05:52.719 align:start position:0%
appears to have been a predone
 
02:05:55.470 --> 02:05:55.480 align:start position:0%
conclusion or predetermined conclusion I
 
02:05:57.270 --> 02:05:57.280 align:start position:0%
can tell you from my expertise in
 
02:05:59.390 --> 02:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
mathematical modeling that you can make
 
02:06:00.950 --> 02:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
a mathematical model say anything you
 
02:06:03.669 --> 02:06:03.679 align:start position:0%
want by changing the assumptions for
 
02:06:05.589 --> 02:06:05.599 align:start position:0%
example I find it interesting they used
 
02:06:09.629 --> 02:06:09.639 align:start position:0%
2019 Energy prices and 2021 construction
 
02:06:12.109 --> 02:06:12.119 align:start position:0%
prices they did not over time look at
 
02:06:14.149 --> 02:06:14.159 align:start position:0%
the cost of energy increase over time
 
02:06:16.390 --> 02:06:16.400 align:start position:0%
over the amortization period they looked
 
02:06:19.270 --> 02:06:19.280 align:start position:0%
at uh nor did they consider a change in
 
02:06:21.470 --> 02:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
technology from say fossil fuels to heat
 
02:06:23.790 --> 02:06:23.800 align:start position:0%
pumps which would I said again give you
 
02:06:25.549 --> 02:06:25.559 align:start position:0%
an efficiency Improvement at least four
 
02:06:29.589 --> 02:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
to eight times that of fossil fuels but
 
02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:30.960 align:start position:0%
I want to bring up another issue here
 
02:06:32.589 --> 02:06:32.599 align:start position:0%
that hasn't been spoken about and that
 
02:06:36.589 --> 02:06:36.599 align:start position:0%
is quality that is the human environment
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
the quality of the environment in which
 
02:06:41.629 --> 02:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
we live in human Comfort can be measured
 
02:06:44.229 --> 02:06:44.239 align:start position:0%
and analytically we can measure it very
 
02:06:46.750 --> 02:06:46.760 align:start position:0%
accurately we as humans like an
 
02:06:49.390 --> 02:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
environment that is roughly 40 to 60%
 
02:06:52.069 --> 02:06:52.079 align:start position:0%
relative humidity for example we like
 
02:06:53.910 --> 02:06:53.920 align:start position:0%
temperature where the gradient the
 
02:06:55.549 --> 02:06:55.559 align:start position:0%
change in temperature across a given
 
02:06:57.870 --> 02:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
environment like a room uh tends to be
 
02:07:00.270 --> 02:07:00.280 align:start position:0%
very low and low air velocity as well
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
these are quantifiable numbers that we
 
02:07:06.510 --> 02:07:06.520 align:start position:0%
can predict very accurately the 2020
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
building code uh helps to achieve a good
 
02:07:13.109 --> 02:07:13.119 align:start position:0%
healthy indoor environment air quality
 
02:07:15.709 --> 02:07:15.719 align:start position:0%
environment air quality has become quite
 
02:07:18.589 --> 02:07:18.599 align:start position:0%
important uh as you well know due to the
 
02:07:21.350 --> 02:07:21.360 align:start position:0%
Co pandemic and compliance to these
 
02:07:23.629 --> 02:07:23.639 align:start position:0%
building specifications is extremely
 
02:07:26.629 --> 02:07:26.639 align:start position:0%
important for Healthy Living we as
 
02:07:28.830 --> 02:07:28.840 align:start position:0%
humans live in these homes and we work
 
02:07:31.510 --> 02:07:31.520 align:start position:0%
in these buildings making them energy
 
02:07:35.310 --> 02:07:35.320 align:start position:0%
efficient saves operating cost over time
 
02:07:37.189 --> 02:07:37.199 align:start position:0%
and reduces carbon emission to our
 
02:07:39.830 --> 02:07:39.840 align:start position:0%
planet which is becoming increasingly uh
 
02:07:43.430 --> 02:07:43.440 align:start position:0%
a problem furthermore the it reduces by
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
reducing the cost associated with
 
02:07:47.709 --> 02:07:47.719 align:start position:0%
operating the building uh there is more
 
02:07:49.549 --> 02:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
available to the homeowner as
 
02:07:51.870 --> 02:07:51.880 align:start position:0%
discretionary spending and banking or
 
02:07:53.589 --> 02:07:53.599 align:start position:0%
institutions are beginning to notice
 
02:07:57.430 --> 02:07:57.440 align:start position:0%
this and offer lower cost loans uh now
 
02:07:59.830 --> 02:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
and lower interest rates associated with
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
Green Building
 
02:08:03.790 --> 02:08:03.800 align:start position:0%
design so I would encourage you not to
 
02:08:06.549 --> 02:08:06.559 align:start position:0%
just look at first cost and to study
 
02:08:08.549 --> 02:08:08.559 align:start position:0%
carefully any any study that's been
 
02:08:10.910 --> 02:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
brought to you that looks at
 
02:08:13.750 --> 02:08:13.760 align:start position:0%
amortization over time with a careful
 
02:08:16.629 --> 02:08:16.639 align:start position:0%
eye the 2021 codes are extremely
 
02:08:19.830 --> 02:08:19.840 align:start position:0%
important to us not just for energy
 
02:08:22.950 --> 02:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
reasons but also uh human Comfort
 
02:08:26.709 --> 02:08:26.719 align:start position:0%
reasons which is uh important uh to all
 
02:08:30.189 --> 02:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
occupants whether they commercial or
 
02:08:33.149 --> 02:08:33.159 align:start position:0%
residential questions thank you for your
 
02:08:36.229 --> 02:08:36.239 align:start position:0%
testimony yes representative
 
02:08:40.189 --> 02:08:40.199 align:start position:0%
man sorry I had my microphone on it
 
02:08:43.629 --> 02:08:43.639 align:start position:0%
happens us yeah um thank you you bring
 
02:08:46.589 --> 02:08:46.599 align:start position:0%
out two important aspects of uh
 
02:08:49.790 --> 02:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
commercial buildings and clean energy
 
02:08:56.510 --> 02:08:56.520 align:start position:0%
safe comfort so does 2021 code include
 
02:09:00.990 --> 02:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
the passive green buildings which
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
addresses the
 
02:09:06.549 --> 02:09:06.559 align:start position:0%
energy conservation as well as comfort
 
02:09:09.990 --> 02:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
and clean air in the building uh thank
 
02:09:12.350 --> 02:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
you for your question no uh passive
 
02:09:14.629 --> 02:09:14.639 align:start position:0%
house has a higher level uh passive
 
02:09:16.950 --> 02:09:16.960 align:start position:0%
house uh has a specification of for
 
02:09:20.109 --> 02:09:20.119 align:start position:0%
example 6 uh air changes so passive
 
02:09:23.030 --> 02:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
house is very tight uh and is above the
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
20 point code uh but since you've
 
02:09:27.750 --> 02:09:27.760 align:start position:0%
brought up passive house I will tell you
 
02:09:29.549 --> 02:09:29.559 align:start position:0%
that the heating and cooling load of a
 
02:09:33.229 --> 02:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
passive house design is so low that uh
 
02:09:34.950 --> 02:09:34.960 align:start position:0%
you can reduce the capital cost
 
02:09:36.629 --> 02:09:36.639 align:start position:0%
associated with your heating and cooling
 
02:09:39.629 --> 02:09:39.639 align:start position:0%
equipment to the point where it is quite
 
02:09:42.030 --> 02:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
small and putting a solar array in your
 
02:09:45.229 --> 02:09:45.239 align:start position:0%
home can make your home actually
 
02:09:47.229 --> 02:09:47.239 align:start position:0%
positive with respect to energy
 
02:09:48.990 --> 02:09:49.000 align:start position:0%
production to the point where it could
 
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
for example power your automobile the
 
02:09:53.109 --> 02:09:53.119 align:start position:0%
National Institutes of science and
 
02:09:55.589 --> 02:09:55.599 align:start position:0%
technology did an experiment in Bethesda
 
02:09:57.990 --> 02:09:58.000 align:start position:0%
in the Maryland area and built a home
 
02:10:00.549 --> 02:10:00.559 align:start position:0%
not even to passive house but to 2021
 
02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:03.639 align:start position:0%
standards and put a 10 kilowatt uh array
 
02:10:05.830 --> 02:10:05.840 align:start position:0%
on the top on the roof of porch roof
 
02:10:07.430 --> 02:10:07.440 align:start position:0%
it's a beautiful home if I could show it
 
02:10:09.629 --> 02:10:09.639 align:start position:0%
to you I would it's beautiful I can send
 
02:10:12.390 --> 02:10:12.400 align:start position:0%
you the report first year of operation
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
they exceeded the energy consumption of
 
02:10:15.430 --> 02:10:15.440 align:start position:0%
the home by
 
02:10:18.910 --> 02:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
7% enough to power the autom that was
 
02:10:20.350 --> 02:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
parked in the
 
02:10:24.669 --> 02:10:24.679 align:start position:0%
garage this is not science fiction this
 
02:10:27.149 --> 02:10:27.159 align:start position:0%
has been proven to be able to be done
 
02:10:30.430 --> 02:10:30.440 align:start position:0%
what is important is that we make the
 
02:10:32.990 --> 02:10:33.000 align:start position:0%
investment during the build sequence if
 
02:10:35.510 --> 02:10:35.520 align:start position:0%
we don't do it up front the cost to do
 
02:10:38.109 --> 02:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
it later is at least a factor of 10 very
 
02:10:40.910 --> 02:10:40.920 align:start position:0%
hard to go in and reinsulate a slab
 
02:10:43.149 --> 02:10:43.159 align:start position:0%
after it's been poured or reinsulate
 
02:10:45.430 --> 02:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
concrete walls after they've been poured
 
02:10:48.709 --> 02:10:48.719 align:start position:0%
if you don't do it up front you pay
 
02:10:50.709 --> 02:10:50.719 align:start position:0%
throughout the life of the building an
 
02:10:53.069 --> 02:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
increased energy costs and if you ever
 
02:10:55.310 --> 02:10:55.320 align:start position:0%
wanted to retrofit the building it would
 
02:10:58.549 --> 02:10:58.559 align:start position:0%
be at least a factor of 10 more to do so
 
02:11:00.430 --> 02:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
so I encourage you to think about these
 
02:11:03.510 --> 02:11:03.520 align:start position:0%
as we go forward I again support the
 
02:11:06.310 --> 02:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
recommendation the amendment that uh
 
02:11:07.950 --> 02:11:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative MC Williams has put
 
02:11:11.629 --> 02:11:11.639 align:start position:0%
forward opposed the bill in its current
 
02:11:11.639 --> 02:11:13.950 align:start position:0%
forward opposed the bill in its current
form

02:11:13.950 --> 02:11:13.960 align:start position:0%
form
 
02:11:16.189 --> 02:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
represent are you going to be available
 
02:11:18.350 --> 02:11:18.360 align:start position:0%
for the subcommittee M Mr would
 
02:11:20.109 --> 02:11:20.119 align:start position:0%
certainly make myself available at any
 
02:11:22.629 --> 02:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
committee you would like me to be at yes
 
02:11:25.709 --> 02:11:25.719 align:start position:0%
for sure thank you any other
 
02:11:27.750 --> 02:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you very much for your
 
02:11:30.030 --> 02:11:30.040 align:start position:0%
testimony um did anybody else wish to
 
02:11:32.470 --> 02:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
speak on HB
 
02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
1059 saying none I will close the public
 
02:11:37.990 --> 02:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
hearing on HB 1059 and welcome the chair
 
02:11:47.149 --> 02:11:47.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:47.159 --> 02:12:01.069 align:start position:0%
 
table

02:12:01.069 --> 02:12:01.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:03.549 --> 02:12:03.559 align:start position:0%
I do wish to apologize to the committee
 
02:12:06.870 --> 02:12:06.880 align:start position:0%
for bringing the wrong Amendment and to
 
02:12:09.910 --> 02:12:09.920 align:start position:0%
rep thank representative Bailey for his
 
02:12:13.870 --> 02:12:13.880 align:start position:0%
skills in in noticing that because I
 
02:12:13.880 --> 02:12:17.069 align:start position:0%
skills in in noticing that because I
didn't

02:12:17.069 --> 02:12:17.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:17.079 --> 02:12:19.229 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:12:19.229 --> 02:12:19.239 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:12:22.589 --> 02:12:22.599 align:start position:0%
well I wanted to to thank representative
 
02:12:24.790 --> 02:12:24.800 align:start position:0%
Bailey for actually reading the
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
amendment all right uh open the hearing
 
02:12:41.109 --> 02:12:41.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:12:44.669 --> 02:12:44.679 align:start position:0%
lungren thank you madam chair um uh
 
02:12:46.149 --> 02:12:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative David lungren from
 
02:12:49.149 --> 02:12:49.159 align:start position:0%
Londoner Rockingham 16
 
02:12:52.510 --> 02:12:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh I totally support this bill uh it's a
 
02:12:55.109 --> 02:12:55.119 align:start position:0%
very easy Bill what it does is
 
02:12:55.119 --> 02:12:56.510 align:start position:0%
very easy Bill what it does is
essentially

02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
essentially
 
02:13:00.069 --> 02:13:00.079 align:start position:0%
uh allow someone to run for Sheriff as
 
02:13:02.669 --> 02:13:02.679 align:start position:0%
long as uh they haven't reached the age
 
02:13:05.310 --> 02:13:05.320 align:start position:0%
of 70 if they reach the age of 70 during
 
02:13:08.030 --> 02:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
their term um unfortunately they're
 
02:13:11.589 --> 02:13:11.599 align:start position:0%
supposed to resign so uh I think if we
 
02:13:14.069 --> 02:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
extend it so that they can finish their
 
02:13:16.510 --> 02:13:16.520 align:start position:0%
term out it will be beneficial to all of
 
02:13:20.149 --> 02:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
us and um that's pretty much it I want
 
02:13:22.870 --> 02:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
to make sure you guys break for lunch
 
02:13:25.950 --> 02:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
so thank you we appreciate your
 
02:13:28.750 --> 02:13:28.760 align:start position:0%
consideration um any questions are there
 
02:13:30.870 --> 02:13:30.880 align:start position:0%
any questions from the committee yeah
 
02:13:34.350 --> 02:13:34.360 align:start position:0%
represent leus um my only question is is
 
02:13:37.030 --> 02:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
there anything that limits uh how long
 
02:13:39.750 --> 02:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
the term of a sheriff can be so if they
 
02:13:43.310 --> 02:13:43.320 align:start position:0%
turn 70 shortly after uh the beginning
 
02:13:45.030 --> 02:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
of their term what's the oldest they
 
02:13:48.310 --> 02:13:48.320 align:start position:0%
could be and still serve if this pass if
 
02:13:51.310 --> 02:13:51.320 align:start position:0%
if they're 70 in their uh first year of
 
02:13:54.669 --> 02:13:54.679 align:start position:0%
of um election of sheriff then they have
 
02:13:56.589 --> 02:13:56.599 align:start position:0%
three more years and they're
 
02:13:59.709 --> 02:13:59.719 align:start position:0%
done follow up or in some cases two
 
02:14:01.750 --> 02:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
years depending on that's I'm sorry
 
02:14:04.109 --> 02:14:04.119 align:start position:0%
thank is there something that limits the
 
02:14:06.069 --> 02:14:06.079 align:start position:0%
maximum the length of their term can be
 
02:14:07.229 --> 02:14:07.239 align:start position:0%
and where is
 
02:14:09.669 --> 02:14:09.679 align:start position:0%
that the AG
 
02:14:12.910 --> 02:14:12.920 align:start position:0%
is statute or rules or the Constitution
 
02:14:16.870 --> 02:14:16.880 align:start position:0%
not that I know okay thank you thank
 
02:14:19.870 --> 02:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
you any other questions thank you very
 
02:14:28.270 --> 02:14:28.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:30.270 --> 02:14:30.280 align:start position:0%
Wallace thank you madam chair for the
 
02:14:31.830 --> 02:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
record I'm representative Scott Wallace
 
02:14:33.910 --> 02:14:33.920 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County District 8 the town of
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
Danville I also sit on the uh Rockham
 
02:14:39.510 --> 02:14:39.520 align:start position:0%
county executive committee and in my
 
02:14:42.470 --> 02:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
role is chair of the uh Sheriff's Office
 
02:14:44.669 --> 02:14:44.679 align:start position:0%
uh subcommittee rocket him county has
 
02:14:46.950 --> 02:14:46.960 align:start position:0%
had some issues over the past decade
 
02:14:50.069 --> 02:14:50.079 align:start position:0%
with uh keeping the sheriff's office
 
02:14:53.109 --> 02:14:53.119 align:start position:0%
with some continuity um we had a Sheriff
 
02:14:55.990 --> 02:14:56.000 align:start position:0%
pass away in 2015 necessitating the
 
02:14:58.229 --> 02:14:58.239 align:start position:0%
county delegation to appoint a sheriff
 
02:15:00.510 --> 02:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
who was only able to serve for one term
 
02:15:03.149 --> 02:15:03.159 align:start position:0%
because he was aged out uh and that's
 
02:15:05.549 --> 02:15:05.559 align:start position:0%
created a little bit of a um continuity
 
02:15:07.549 --> 02:15:07.559 align:start position:0%
problem with the with the department so
 
02:15:10.229 --> 02:15:10.239 align:start position:0%
this simple fix would allow a sheriff
 
02:15:12.189 --> 02:15:12.199 align:start position:0%
who attains the age of who turn 70
 
02:15:14.189 --> 02:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
during his term to continue the term
 
02:15:15.950 --> 02:15:15.960 align:start position:0%
it's very simple we'd like to see that
 
02:15:17.629 --> 02:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
happen and we ask for this uh committee
 
02:15:19.910 --> 02:15:19.920 align:start position:0%
to pass this I'd be happy to answer any
 
02:15:22.069 --> 02:15:22.079 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
02:15:24.430 --> 02:15:24.440 align:start position:0%
sh thank you madam chair thank you for
 
02:15:27.790 --> 02:15:27.800 align:start position:0%
taking my question um how many counties
 
02:15:31.189 --> 02:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
do you know um have a four-year term for
 
02:15:33.870 --> 02:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
their Sheriff as opposed to two I
 
02:15:35.669 --> 02:15:35.679 align:start position:0%
believe there's two counties at this
 
02:15:38.870 --> 02:15:38.880 align:start position:0%
point just one okay I stand corrected
 
02:15:42.549 --> 02:15:42.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:45.549 --> 02:15:45.559 align:start position:0%
point okay any other questions thank you
 
02:15:47.430 --> 02:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
for answering that question I'm sure it
 
02:16:01.750 --> 02:16:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:04.390 --> 02:16:04.400 align:start position:0%
mahos thank you chairman McGuire and
 
02:16:06.830 --> 02:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
members of this committee for for me to
 
02:16:09.229 --> 02:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
be here today to speak about this bill
 
02:16:11.750 --> 02:16:11.760 align:start position:0%
that we're trying to put in my name is
 
02:16:13.669 --> 02:16:13.679 align:start position:0%
Chuck mes I'm the high Sheriff of
 
02:16:17.750 --> 02:16:17.760 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County in 2022 the state leg
 
02:16:19.629 --> 02:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
legislator passed a bill that would
 
02:16:22.669 --> 02:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
change the term of office for Rockham
 
02:16:25.189 --> 02:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
County elected officials from a 2-year
 
02:16:29.270 --> 02:16:29.280 align:start position:0%
to a 4-year term as a result should I be
 
02:16:31.910 --> 02:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
reelected in my next cycle I will reach
 
02:16:31.920 --> 02:16:32.830 align:start position:0%
reelected in my next cycle I will reach
the

02:16:32.830 --> 02:16:32.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:16:36.950 --> 02:16:36.960 align:start position:0%
age of of 70 during the middle of my
 
02:16:41.030 --> 02:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
term so I would only be able to fulfill
 
02:16:42.589 --> 02:16:42.599 align:start position:0%
that term for two
 
02:16:45.629 --> 02:16:45.639 align:start position:0%
years currently I ask you support this
 
02:16:47.790 --> 02:16:47.800 align:start position:0%
change in the Constitution the the
 
02:16:49.429 --> 02:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
change would permit any Sheriff who
 
02:16:51.389 --> 02:16:51.399 align:start position:0%
attains the age of 70 years to finish
 
02:16:54.750 --> 02:16:54.760 align:start position:0%
out that current term as the official du
 
02:16:58.030 --> 02:16:58.040 align:start position:0%
duly elected by the voters pass of that
 
02:17:00.309 --> 02:17:00.319 align:start position:0%
Amendment would allow the voters of the
 
02:17:03.190 --> 02:17:03.200 align:start position:0%
state to weigh on this critical change
 
02:17:05.110 --> 02:17:05.120 align:start position:0%
the only other person that is restricted
 
02:17:07.750 --> 02:17:07.760 align:start position:0%
by this age is that of Judges they
 
02:17:10.549 --> 02:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
retire retire at or prior to the age of
 
02:17:13.030 --> 02:17:13.040 align:start position:0%
70 however it is common practice that
 
02:17:15.070 --> 02:17:15.080 align:start position:0%
judges return to the bench after
 
02:17:18.469 --> 02:17:18.479 align:start position:0%
retirement to assist a Judicial brand
 
02:17:20.589 --> 02:17:20.599 align:start position:0%
I would classify this as a loophole in
 
02:17:22.190 --> 02:17:22.200 align:start position:0%
the age requirement which is not
 
02:17:23.389 --> 02:17:23.399 align:start position:0%
afforded to
 
02:17:26.830 --> 02:17:26.840 align:start position:0%
sheriffs in closing I I ask you humbly
 
02:17:28.750 --> 02:17:28.760 align:start position:0%
to pass this legislation allow the
 
02:17:30.750 --> 02:17:30.760 align:start position:0%
voters of the state to determine whether
 
02:17:33.309 --> 02:17:33.319 align:start position:0%
a change in age is warranted but I'm
 
02:17:35.070 --> 02:17:35.080 align:start position:0%
going to go off what I wrote Because I
 
02:17:39.950 --> 02:17:39.960 align:start position:0%
feel that I need to speak by my heart um
 
02:17:42.349 --> 02:17:42.359 align:start position:0%
I was elected in 2018 as the high
 
02:17:44.629 --> 02:17:44.639 align:start position:0%
Sheriff of Rockingham County I'm very
 
02:17:46.870 --> 02:17:46.880 align:start position:0%
passionate about what I've done we are
 
02:17:48.870 --> 02:17:48.880 align:start position:0%
fortunate in enough to have Sheriff
 
02:17:51.349 --> 02:17:51.359 align:start position:0%
Downing as our sheriff and as everybody
 
02:17:54.030 --> 02:17:54.040 align:start position:0%
knows that he passed away from cancer uh
 
02:17:55.790 --> 02:17:55.800 align:start position:0%
Sheriff Downing LED that department he
 
02:17:57.870 --> 02:17:57.880 align:start position:0%
started changing the Dynamics of that
 
02:18:00.950 --> 02:18:00.960 align:start position:0%
Sheriff's Office to a full police
 
02:18:03.629 --> 02:18:03.639 align:start position:0%
organization we're lucky to get Mike
 
02:18:06.950 --> 02:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
hero uh elected by the delegation and
 
02:18:09.589 --> 02:18:09.599 align:start position:0%
Mike fulfilled one term but Mike didn't
 
02:18:12.790 --> 02:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
run a second term because of the age
 
02:18:15.270 --> 02:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
requirement so he would have been one
 
02:18:18.030 --> 02:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
year short of
 
02:18:19.870 --> 02:18:19.880 align:start position:0%
you know one year short which means if
 
02:18:21.990 --> 02:18:22.000 align:start position:0%
this bill was put into effect that he
 
02:18:24.629 --> 02:18:24.639 align:start position:0%
could run now it comes to me because we
 
02:18:26.150 --> 02:18:26.160 align:start position:0%
have a four-year term even if I had a
 
02:18:29.349 --> 02:18:29.359 align:start position:0%
two-year term right I would I would I
 
02:18:31.750 --> 02:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
would want to run and if I had to resign
 
02:18:34.709 --> 02:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
I would resign because for six years now
 
02:18:37.150 --> 02:18:37.160 align:start position:0%
I've battled the opio crisis in
 
02:18:39.629 --> 02:18:39.639 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County and the state and I'm
 
02:18:42.030 --> 02:18:42.040 align:start position:0%
getting drugs off the street I've turned
 
02:18:44.549 --> 02:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
it into a full-fledged police
 
02:18:46.589 --> 02:18:46.599 align:start position:0%
organization I've built one of the most
 
02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
effective drug units in the state of New
 
02:18:50.669 --> 02:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
Hampshire we want to continue on that
 
02:18:53.509 --> 02:18:53.519 align:start position:0%
path and just getting this bill passed
 
02:18:55.990 --> 02:18:56.000 align:start position:0%
will give me four years another four
 
02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:57.639 align:start position:0%
years where I can get it done now I
 
02:18:59.950 --> 02:18:59.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to be Sheriff when I'm 75 but
 
02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
I want to I want to make sure that I
 
02:19:03.950 --> 02:19:03.960 align:start position:0%
fulfill the promises I made to the
 
02:19:06.709 --> 02:19:06.719 align:start position:0%
taxpayers and the voters of the state
 
02:19:08.669 --> 02:19:08.679 align:start position:0%
about getting these illegal drugs off
 
02:19:10.990 --> 02:19:11.000 align:start position:0%
the street I think it's a good bill I
 
02:19:13.509 --> 02:19:13.519 align:start position:0%
think it will if other sheriff's offic I
 
02:19:15.030 --> 02:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
know some other sheriff's officers are
 
02:19:17.230 --> 02:19:17.240 align:start position:0%
trying to get a you know a 4-year term
 
02:19:18.870 --> 02:19:18.880 align:start position:0%
which they should get cuz two years
 
02:19:21.589 --> 02:19:21.599 align:start position:0%
isn't enough time to get anything done
 
02:19:23.429 --> 02:19:23.439 align:start position:0%
so I appreciate you letting me listen to
 
02:19:26.629 --> 02:19:26.639 align:start position:0%
me today and I thank you for your time
 
02:19:29.150 --> 02:19:29.160 align:start position:0%
are there any questions representative
 
02:19:32.549 --> 02:19:32.559 align:start position:0%
gold just um to get clarification on a
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
question that representative luk leus
 
02:19:39.230 --> 02:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
asked earlier if you a if this passed
 
02:19:41.589 --> 02:19:41.599 align:start position:0%
and you were able to continue your term
 
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
to the end and you were over age 70
 
02:19:46.150 --> 02:19:46.160 align:start position:0%
would that mean that you could not run
 
02:19:48.589 --> 02:19:48.599 align:start position:0%
for reelection because you were too old
 
02:19:51.110 --> 02:19:51.120 align:start position:0%
once I'll be too old so once if this
 
02:19:54.230 --> 02:19:54.240 align:start position:0%
bill passes the the voters elect me to
 
02:19:56.790 --> 02:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
be Sheriff again then I'll be able to
 
02:19:59.469 --> 02:19:59.479 align:start position:0%
stay on till I'm 72 but I'm not going to
 
02:20:01.270 --> 02:20:01.280 align:start position:0%
be able to I won't be able to run again
 
02:20:04.309 --> 02:20:04.319 align:start position:0%
because it's a 70 age
 
02:20:06.590 --> 02:20:06.600 align:start position:0%
Gap representative
 
02:20:09.070 --> 02:20:09.080 align:start position:0%
G thank you what are the requirements
 
02:20:12.349 --> 02:20:12.359 align:start position:0%
for running for sheriff in New Hampshire
 
02:20:14.389 --> 02:20:14.399 align:start position:0%

youbody you can be a plumber you can be
 
02:20:28.030 --> 02:20:28.040 align:start position:0%
electrici you could be a guy pumping gas
 
02:20:29.910 --> 02:20:29.920 align:start position:0%
at a gas station to run for Sheriff
 
02:20:33.030 --> 02:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
there's no College requirements which is
 
02:20:34.990 --> 02:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
it's just unfortunate I mean I came to
 
02:20:37.990 --> 02:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
this job as a part-time deputy sheriff
 
02:20:39.670 --> 02:20:39.680 align:start position:0%
but I'm also a businessman I own my own
 
02:20:42.110 --> 02:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
business in London area New Hampshire so
 
02:20:44.110 --> 02:20:44.120 align:start position:0%
I mean I brought close to 40 years with
 
02:20:46.389 --> 02:20:46.399 align:start position:0%
the business experience plus law
 
02:20:47.910 --> 02:20:47.920 align:start position:0%
enforcement experience working for the
 
02:20:49.830 --> 02:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
Rockingham County Sheriff's Office and
 
02:20:51.270 --> 02:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
four years with the New Hampshire State
 
02:20:53.190 --> 02:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
Police but there are no requirements for
 
02:20:55.710 --> 02:20:55.720 align:start position:0%
Sheriff that's why it's very important
 
02:20:58.750 --> 02:20:58.760 align:start position:0%
that we try to listen the sheriffs in
 
02:21:01.990 --> 02:21:02.000 align:start position:0%
the state are all hardworking men and
 
02:21:05.309 --> 02:21:05.319 align:start position:0%
and and and you when I first took over
 
02:21:08.630 --> 02:21:08.640 align:start position:0%
this job two years the first two years
 
02:21:10.510 --> 02:21:10.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're getting your feet
 
02:21:12.190 --> 02:21:12.200 align:start position:0%
wet you do you know you're you're trying
 
02:21:13.990 --> 02:21:14.000 align:start position:0%
to get as much as you're done when we
 
02:21:15.910 --> 02:21:15.920 align:start position:0%
got this four-year term it's like this
 
02:21:18.070 --> 02:21:18.080 align:start position:0%
is like phenomenal because now I can
 
02:21:21.270 --> 02:21:21.280 align:start position:0%
concentrate on my job taking drugs off
 
02:21:23.710 --> 02:21:23.720 align:start position:0%
the street being community policing
 
02:21:25.710 --> 02:21:25.720 align:start position:0%
right getting out there to do what we
 
02:21:27.550 --> 02:21:27.560 align:start position:0%
can do to assist our local law
 
02:21:29.590 --> 02:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
enforcement Partners the state police
 
02:21:31.870 --> 02:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
right now are down 80 Troopers in this
 
02:21:35.389 --> 02:21:35.399 align:start position:0%
state so or close to 80 Troopers but
 
02:21:37.990 --> 02:21:38.000 align:start position:0%
we're there helping out the state police
 
02:21:39.830 --> 02:21:39.840 align:start position:0%
all these small police departments can't
 
02:21:42.910 --> 02:21:42.920 align:start position:0%
get police officers so we're there to
 
02:21:44.670 --> 02:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
support our local police departments in
 
02:21:46.750 --> 02:21:46.760 align:start position:0%
investigations are backing them up are
 
02:21:48.710 --> 02:21:48.720 align:start position:0%
working their their towns that's what we
 
02:21:51.429 --> 02:21:51.439 align:start position:0%
do as as far as the experience goes with
 
02:21:53.550 --> 02:21:53.560 align:start position:0%
this job anybody can run for Sheriff but
 
02:21:55.190 --> 02:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
you want to try to keep the the right
 
02:21:56.830 --> 02:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
people on the right job I've been doing
 
02:21:58.670 --> 02:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
a great job all the sheriff's been doing
 
02:22:01.830 --> 02:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
a great job it just it's just with that
 
02:22:04.790 --> 02:22:04.800 align:start position:0%
70-year cap it's it's it's hard to
 
02:22:07.030 --> 02:22:07.040 align:start position:0%
predict the future you know what I mean
 
02:22:09.429 --> 02:22:09.439 align:start position:0%
about about this job I hope that answers
 
02:22:09.439 --> 02:22:10.389 align:start position:0%
about about this job I hope that answers
your

02:22:10.389 --> 02:22:10.399 align:start position:0%
your
 
02:22:13.309 --> 02:22:13.319 align:start position:0%
question actually it doesn't follow up
 
02:22:15.590 --> 02:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
because if there's a cap on age that's a
 
02:22:18.190 --> 02:22:18.200 align:start position:0%
requirement so does are you required to
 
02:22:19.950 --> 02:22:19.960 align:start position:0%
live in the county I don't care about
 
02:22:21.870 --> 02:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
your qualifications I just want I have
 
02:22:24.270 --> 02:22:24.280 align:start position:0%
to live in Rockingham County and what
 
02:22:28.190 --> 02:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
else to run for Sheriff that's it that's
 
02:22:31.830 --> 02:22:31.840 align:start position:0%
it so why don't we say instead of this
 
02:22:34.150 --> 02:22:34.160 align:start position:0%
why don't we say that in order to run
 
02:22:37.389 --> 02:22:37.399 align:start position:0%
for County Sheriff you can't be 70
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
during your
 
02:22:40.630 --> 02:22:40.640 align:start position:0%
term I don't understand the question
 
02:22:43.230 --> 02:22:43.240 align:start position:0%
that would limit the age well I mean it
 
02:22:46.150 --> 02:22:46.160 align:start position:0%
would be nice to get rid of the age
 
02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:50.309 align:start position:0%
would be nice to get rid of the age
requirement

02:22:50.309 --> 02:22:50.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:52.590 --> 02:22:52.600 align:start position:0%
no I'm saying that you cannot run if
 
02:22:55.750 --> 02:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
you're going to turn 70 within your term
 
02:22:56.910 --> 02:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
that would be a different way of
 
02:22:58.190 --> 02:22:58.200 align:start position:0%
phrasing what you're doing then you're
 
02:23:00.150 --> 02:23:00.160 align:start position:0%
sure changing you're sure changing me
 
02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:01.950 align:start position:0%
sure changing you're sure changing me
two

02:23:01.950 --> 02:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
two
 
02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:04.319 align:start position:0%
years I could run but then I would have
 
02:23:04.319 --> 02:23:05.270 align:start position:0%
years I could run but then I would have
to

02:23:05.270 --> 02:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:23:07.870 --> 02:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
resign I'd have to
 
02:23:11.710 --> 02:23:11.720 align:start position:0%
resign statute says you're out of
 
02:23:15.349 --> 02:23:15.359 align:start position:0%
office correct you're done I'm done so
 
02:23:18.910 --> 02:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
so when I turn when I turn 68 years old
 
02:23:20.870 --> 02:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
right I'm planning on running if this
 
02:23:23.110 --> 02:23:23.120 align:start position:0%
Bill gets passed or not I'm planning on
 
02:23:24.990 --> 02:23:25.000 align:start position:0%
running and then I'll resign and then
 
02:23:29.469 --> 02:23:29.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:29.479 --> 02:23:31.150 align:start position:0%

things they have um accepting donations
 
03:36:03.469 --> 03:36:03.479 align:start position:0%
for a number of items um it was realized
 
03:36:05.550 --> 03:36:05.560 align:start position:0%
that unlike many other departments here
 
03:36:07.750 --> 03:36:07.760 align:start position:0%
in the state of New Hampshire uh they
 
03:36:09.710 --> 03:36:09.720 align:start position:0%
don't have the statutory authority to
 
03:36:12.189 --> 03:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
accept these or actually uh have in
 
03:36:15.510 --> 03:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
place a way for uh accepting donations
 
03:36:18.070 --> 03:36:18.080 align:start position:0%
for um the documents or anything else
 
03:36:20.950 --> 03:36:20.960 align:start position:0%

money for uh also maintaining these
 
03:36:27.710 --> 03:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
articles um and also if I may Madam
 
03:36:29.990 --> 03:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
chair there was an amendment uh
 
03:36:32.550 --> 03:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
submitted to OS last week at the request
 
03:36:37.710 --> 03:36:37.720 align:start position:0%
of secretary state's office that is not
 
03:36:37.720 --> 03:36:38.670 align:start position:0%
of secretary state's office that is not
ready

03:36:38.670 --> 03:36:38.680 align:start position:0%
ready
 
03:36:42.469 --> 03:36:42.479 align:start position:0%
yet no surprise um but I was just over
 
03:36:43.590 --> 03:36:43.600 align:start position:0%
there and they said it's urgent they'll
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
have it to us in probably 15 20 minutes
 
03:36:47.429 --> 03:36:47.439 align:start position:0%
that's well after this hearing but what
 
03:36:51.670 --> 03:36:51.680 align:start position:0%
that does is um put two positions into
 
03:36:53.189 --> 03:36:53.199 align:start position:0%
the Secretary of State's office for the
 
03:36:57.269 --> 03:36:57.279 align:start position:0%
maintenance of this division um which uh
 
03:36:59.429 --> 03:36:59.439 align:start position:0%
they will talk about
 
03:37:03.550 --> 03:37:03.560 align:start position:0%
um when they come up um it's money they
 
03:37:07.189 --> 03:37:07.199 align:start position:0%
already have available to put uh put
 
03:37:08.950 --> 03:37:08.960 align:start position:0%
into position um they're not looking for
 
03:37:13.269 --> 03:37:13.279 align:start position:0%
added Monies um so if I may I'll let
 
03:37:15.189 --> 03:37:15.199 align:start position:0%
them speak to this bill and speak to
 
03:37:17.309 --> 03:37:17.319 align:start position:0%
that Amendment um because they're well
 
03:37:18.590 --> 03:37:18.600 align:start position:0%
versed in
 
03:37:22.510 --> 03:37:22.520 align:start position:0%
it thank you uh representative uh leus
 
03:37:24.110 --> 03:37:24.120 align:start position:0%
just a quick question so just to be
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
clear this allows them to accept things
 
03:37:28.550 --> 03:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't require them to accept
 
03:37:30.710 --> 03:37:30.720 align:start position:0%
anything donated to them is that correct
 
03:37:33.550 --> 03:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
correct and and follow up um is there
 
03:37:35.269 --> 03:37:35.279 align:start position:0%
any requirement that they anything
 
03:37:36.750 --> 03:37:36.760 align:start position:0%
they've accepted they have to keep for
 
03:37:39.229 --> 03:37:39.239 align:start position:0%
the rest of Eternity or can they choose
 
03:37:41.710 --> 03:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
not to at some point I believe they have
 
03:37:43.110 --> 03:37:43.120 align:start position:0%
their choice to do what they want but
 
03:37:44.510 --> 03:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
I'm sure they can answer that for you
 
03:37:46.750 --> 03:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
thanks but like I said many other state
 
03:37:48.990 --> 03:37:49.000 align:start position:0%
agencies already have this in place that
 
03:37:51.269 --> 03:37:51.279 align:start position:0%
this option and they going through their
 
03:37:53.389 --> 03:37:53.399 align:start position:0%
records found out that it's not in their
 
03:37:56.269 --> 03:37:56.279 align:start position:0%
statute so they were asking for it all
 
03:37:58.630 --> 03:37:58.640 align:start position:0%
right thank you other questions thank
 
03:38:03.189 --> 03:38:03.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:09.309 --> 03:38:09.319 align:start position:0%

03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
functions the first is to preserve

our archival materials come from a
 
03:42:06.469 --> 03:42:06.479 align:start position:0%
variety of places um and we have
 
03:42:08.950 --> 03:42:08.960 align:start position:0%
received donations in the past um this
 
03:42:11.670 --> 03:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
just formally allow ows us to do so now
 
03:42:14.070 --> 03:42:14.080 align:start position:0%
we do have the right to say no to
 
03:42:16.309 --> 03:42:16.319 align:start position:0%
donations and things you know that we
 
03:42:20.070 --> 03:42:20.080 align:start position:0%

03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
discretion okay represent Brown and then
 
03:42:24.830 --> 03:42:24.840 align:start position:0%
lus uh thank you madam chair and thanks
 
03:42:27.990 --> 03:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
for being here taking my question so you
 
03:42:29.349 --> 03:42:29.359 align:start position:0%
have two positions that haven't been
 
03:42:32.229 --> 03:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
filled and that's what these two B
 
03:42:33.750 --> 03:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
positions are going to take that I
 
03:42:35.990 --> 03:42:36.000 align:start position:0%
understand that thank you for your
 
03:42:38.030 --> 03:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
question we have one position that's
 
03:42:40.469 --> 03:42:40.479 align:start position:0%
currently open um it's open because of a
 
03:42:43.030 --> 03:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
recent retirement but because of the
 
03:42:44.950 --> 03:42:44.960 align:start position:0%
various vacancies we've had throughout
 
03:42:48.990 --> 03:42:49.000 align:start position:0%
the year giving them the pay bump um is
 
03:42:51.590 --> 03:42:51.600 align:start position:0%
already covered by money we have okay
 
03:42:55.189 --> 03:42:55.199 align:start position:0%
follow up follow so will this add
 
03:42:57.229 --> 03:42:57.239 align:start position:0%
permanently add to your staff
 
03:42:57.239 --> 03:42:59.229 align:start position:0%
permanently add to your staff
number-wise

03:42:59.229 --> 03:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
number-wise
 
03:43:02.309 --> 03:43:02.319 align:start position:0%
no okay thank
 
03:43:04.910 --> 03:43:04.920 align:start position:0%
you in that case if we do have an
 
03:43:07.950 --> 03:43:07.960 align:start position:0%
amendment to create two new positions at
 
03:43:10.070 --> 03:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
a higher labor grade I trust we will
 
03:43:12.070 --> 03:43:12.080 align:start position:0%
also abolish the lower labor grade
 
03:43:14.550 --> 03:43:14.560 align:start position:0%
positions okay I see you're agreeing we
 
03:43:16.670 --> 03:43:16.680 align:start position:0%
will we'll put that on the checklist
 
03:43:19.189 --> 03:43:19.199 align:start position:0%
thank you representative leus thank you
 
03:43:20.990 --> 03:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
uh two questions one is uh the one IID
 
03:43:23.349 --> 03:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
asked uh representative goalie so if you
 
03:43:26.429 --> 03:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
accept a donation of some material uh do
 
03:43:28.910 --> 03:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
you have an obligation to keep
 
03:43:31.630 --> 03:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
it thank you for your question so that
 
03:43:34.510 --> 03:43:34.520 align:start position:0%
varies on donation to donation we have a
 
03:43:36.950 --> 03:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
deed of gift agreement another policy I
 
03:43:40.910 --> 03:43:40.920 align:start position:0%
had updated this year um which deter
 
03:43:43.110 --> 03:43:43.120 align:start position:0%
based on the donor agreement between me
 
03:43:45.189 --> 03:43:45.199 align:start position:0%
and the donor whether we would keep it
 
03:43:48.389 --> 03:43:48.399 align:start position:0%
in perpetuity whether you know if I go
 
03:43:50.389 --> 03:43:50.399 align:start position:0%
through it and decide we already have
 
03:43:52.389 --> 03:43:52.399 align:start position:0%
several duplicates of these materials
 
03:43:54.630 --> 03:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
and I can throw it away or give it back
 
03:43:57.149 --> 03:43:57.159 align:start position:0%
to the donor it really varies on the
 
03:43:59.110 --> 03:43:59.120 align:start position:0%
materials and the donor whether they
 
03:44:01.870 --> 03:44:01.880 align:start position:0%
want it back or if it'll be disposed of
 
03:44:03.950 --> 03:44:03.960 align:start position:0%
followup follow up so this is going to
 
03:44:05.550 --> 03:44:05.560 align:start position:0%
the uh the positions who said higher
 
03:44:08.429 --> 03:44:08.439 align:start position:0%
labor grade are these um salary
 
03:44:10.910 --> 03:44:10.920 align:start position:0%
positions hourly
 
03:44:15.269 --> 03:44:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:18.550 --> 03:44:18.560 align:start position:0%
you other questions yeah just sorry to
 
03:44:20.429 --> 03:44:20.439 align:start position:0%

03:44:24.790 --> 03:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:24.800 --> 03:44:26.309 align:start position:0%
 
level

03:44:26.309 --> 03:44:26.319 align:start position:0%

03:44:31.429 --> 03:44:31.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:33.790 --> 03:44:33.800 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah I was wondering if these are
 
03:44:35.429 --> 03:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
ones that are going to have to be uh
 
03:44:37.349 --> 03:44:37.359 align:start position:0%
classified and the joint committee on
 
03:44:38.950 --> 03:44:38.960 align:start position:0%
employee classification is going to be
 
03:44:38.960 --> 03:44:40.710 align:start position:0%
employee classification is going to be
seen

03:44:40.710 --> 03:44:40.720 align:start position:0%
seen
 
03:44:42.030 --> 03:44:42.040 align:start position:0%
sorry could you I couldn't hear your
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
question um if these are a salary the

Joint Committee on employee
 
03:45:00.189 --> 03:45:00.199 align:start position:0%

03:46:27.550 --> 03:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:27.560 --> 03:46:28.429 align:start position:0%
 
all

03:46:28.429 --> 03:46:28.439 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:46:31.950 --> 03:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
right the next hearing is at 2 o'clock
 
03:46:38.590 --> 03:46:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:38.600 --> 03:46:43.830 align:start position:0%
 
break

03:46:43.830 --> 03:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:50.630 --> 03:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:53.229 --> 03:46:53.239 align:start position:0%
minutes we'd have time to vote on it but
 
03:47:08.510 --> 03:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:08.520 --> 03:47:12.990 align:start position:0%
 
amendment

03:47:12.990 --> 03:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:13.000 --> 03:47:38.510 align:start position:0%
 
they

03:47:38.510 --> 03:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:38.520 --> 04:05:17.830 align:start position:0%
 
scheduling

04:05:17.830 --> 04:05:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:20.030 --> 04:05:20.040 align:start position:0%
right it's being 2 o'cl I'm opening the
 
04:05:22.550 --> 04:05:22.560 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill 1095 and I call
 
04:05:22.560 --> 04:05:24.070 align:start position:0%
hearing for House Bill 1095 and I call
Representative

04:05:24.070 --> 04:05:24.080 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
04:05:27.070 --> 04:05:27.080 align:start position:0%
Gallagher hi I'm representative Eric
 
04:05:30.630 --> 04:05:30.640 align:start position:0%
Gallagher representing Marat County
 
04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
District 20 which is conquered w six um
 
04:05:37.510 --> 04:05:37.520 align:start position:0%
down that ways a little ways um and I'm
 
04:05:41.870 --> 04:05:41.880 align:start position:0%
here to introduce HB 1095 relative to
 
04:05:44.590 --> 04:05:44.600 align:start position:0%
the official pronunciation of New
 
04:05:48.189 --> 04:05:48.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and conquered so um first
 
04:05:50.149 --> 04:05:50.159 align:start position:0%
thing I'd note is just which portion of
 
04:05:53.429 --> 04:05:53.439 align:start position:0%
the rsas this is going in this is going
 
04:05:56.149 --> 04:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
in RSA Section 3 which is the state
 
04:05:59.550 --> 04:05:59.560 align:start position:0%
symbol section so it's the kind of thing
 
04:06:03.030 --> 04:06:03.040 align:start position:0%
where there's the state animal um state
 
04:06:06.790 --> 04:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
insect butterfly fruit all that sort of
 
04:06:10.110 --> 04:06:10.120 align:start position:0%
thing um so yeah just as with the other
 
04:06:14.229 --> 04:06:14.239 align:start position:0%
state symbols um e for example even
 
04:06:16.870 --> 04:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
though the state fruit is the pumpkin
 
04:06:19.389 --> 04:06:19.399 align:start position:0%
you can still grow other fruits besides
 
04:06:21.550 --> 04:06:21.560 align:start position:0%
pumpkins which I'm sure our Apple
 
04:06:24.189 --> 04:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
Growers appreciate so um since I'm
 
04:06:26.309 --> 04:06:26.319 align:start position:0%
putting it in the state symbol section
 
04:06:30.110 --> 04:06:30.120 align:start position:0%
um you know you can still feel free to
 
04:06:34.149 --> 04:06:34.159 align:start position:0%
say Concord if you wish um but it's
 
04:06:37.830 --> 04:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
basically just having it um put some
 
04:06:39.950 --> 04:06:39.960 align:start position:0%
some having the pronunciation put
 
04:06:45.429 --> 04:06:45.439 align:start position:0%
somewhere um official so that people can
 
04:06:47.550 --> 04:06:47.560 align:start position:0%
know the right way to recognize this
 
04:06:52.269 --> 04:06:52.279 align:start position:0%
basically the um the way I see RSA 3 is
 
04:06:56.149 --> 04:06:56.159 align:start position:0%
basically the section for describing the
 
04:06:58.670 --> 04:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
official branding of the State of New
 
04:07:01.189 --> 04:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um basically these are the
 
04:07:04.990 --> 04:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
symbols by which you'll recognize us and
 
04:07:08.830 --> 04:07:08.840 align:start position:0%
branding is actually something that um a
 
04:07:10.750 --> 04:07:10.760 align:start position:0%
lot of organizations take really
 
04:07:13.550 --> 04:07:13.560 align:start position:0%
seriously and spend a lot of money on
 
04:07:17.790 --> 04:07:17.800 align:start position:0%
like my college for example um spent a
 
04:07:20.550 --> 04:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
large amount of money redesigning its
 
04:07:24.109 --> 04:07:24.119 align:start position:0%
visual identity um so
 
04:07:26.830 --> 04:07:26.840 align:start position:0%
and uh this here ra rather than being
 
04:07:28.389 --> 04:07:28.399 align:start position:0%
visual is
 
04:07:32.429 --> 04:07:32.439 align:start position:0%
auditory um
 
04:07:35.590 --> 04:07:35.600 align:start position:0%
so uh yeah I have the correct
 
04:07:38.750 --> 04:07:38.760 align:start position:0%
pronunciation here I looked up the um I
 
04:07:40.870 --> 04:07:40.880 align:start position:0%
decided to put it in the International
 
04:07:44.349 --> 04:07:44.359 align:start position:0%
Phonetic Alphabet so um that's what this
 
04:07:47.030 --> 04:07:47.040 align:start position:0%
handout that I handed around is is all
 
04:07:48.630 --> 04:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
the different
 
04:07:51.750 --> 04:07:51.760 align:start position:0%
um characters that are in the
 
04:07:54.469 --> 04:07:54.479 align:start position:0%
International Phonetic Alphabet um the
 
04:07:57.309 --> 04:07:57.319 align:start position:0%
reason for that is because English with
 
04:07:59.830 --> 04:07:59.840 align:start position:0%
just the plain Roman alphabet doesn't
 
04:08:03.469 --> 04:08:03.479 align:start position:0%
actually have enough characters to
 
04:08:07.750 --> 04:08:07.760 align:start position:0%
represent every particular sound that
 
04:08:11.790 --> 04:08:11.800 align:start position:0%
that um humans can make with our mouths
 
04:08:16.750 --> 04:08:16.760 align:start position:0%
um so people a few hundred years ago um
 
04:08:20.070 --> 04:08:20.080 align:start position:0%
realized we needed a sort of standard
 
04:08:23.070 --> 04:08:23.080 align:start position:0%
way that um to write sounds that could
 
04:08:26.269 --> 04:08:26.279 align:start position:0%
represent every possible sound in every
 
04:08:28.349 --> 04:08:28.359 align:start position:0%
possible language so they uh came up
 
04:08:33.189 --> 04:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
with the international ftic alphabet um
 
04:08:37.429 --> 04:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
so yeah it's used in reference works um
 
04:08:38.550 --> 04:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
like like
 
04:08:41.429 --> 04:08:41.439 align:start position:0%
dictionaries um singers will use it if
 
04:08:42.790 --> 04:08:42.800 align:start position:0%
they have to sing in a language they
 
04:08:47.469 --> 04:08:47.479 align:start position:0%
don't know um my um brother actually
 
04:08:49.910 --> 04:08:49.920 align:start position:0%
recently got married and his wife is a
 
04:08:52.870 --> 04:08:52.880 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist so they had to learn
 
04:08:52.880 --> 04:08:53.790 align:start position:0%
speech pathologist so they had to learn
um

04:08:53.790 --> 04:08:53.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:08:57.469 --> 04:08:57.479 align:start position:0%
IPA uh as part of her Speech Pathology
 
04:09:00.550 --> 04:09:00.560 align:start position:0%
training um so yeah it's basically kind
 
04:09:03.349 --> 04:09:03.359 align:start position:0%
of the standard um and then the idea is
 
04:09:05.510 --> 04:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
by putting it in IPA so all right
 
04:09:07.670 --> 04:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
actually this kind of gets to why I file
 
04:09:10.070 --> 04:09:10.080 align:start position:0%
the bill in the first place but um I've
 
04:09:14.830 --> 04:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
been studying Japanese recently and um
 
04:09:19.590 --> 04:09:19.600 align:start position:0%
one of the things I've noticed so um
 
04:09:20.990 --> 04:09:21.000 align:start position:0%
they've got a few different character
 
04:09:23.349 --> 04:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
sets that they use
 
04:09:26.670 --> 04:09:26.680 align:start position:0%
um so one one of them for foreign loan
 
04:09:29.790 --> 04:09:29.800 align:start position:0%
words um
 
04:09:34.750 --> 04:09:34.760 align:start position:0%
and it's um that one's called kataka and
 
04:09:38.550 --> 04:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
is um also phonetically based and when I
 
04:09:41.870 --> 04:09:41.880 align:start position:0%
saw how they had uh how in Japanese they
 
04:09:44.670 --> 04:09:44.680 align:start position:0%
had decided to uh
 
04:09:48.550 --> 04:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
transcribe conquered in New Hampshire I
 
04:09:51.830 --> 04:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
um I was like wait this isn't how you
 
04:09:53.710 --> 04:09:53.720 align:start position:0%
actually pronounce it it looked like
 
04:09:57.550 --> 04:09:57.560 align:start position:0%
Concord and New Hampshire like with a
 
04:10:02.269 --> 04:10:02.279 align:start position:0%
sticking a y in the New Hampshire so um
 
04:10:07.950 --> 04:10:07.960 align:start position:0%
basically the idea here is um that we
 
04:10:11.229 --> 04:10:11.239 align:start position:0%
update the IPA first and then any
 
04:10:15.189 --> 04:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
speakers of languages that have um
 
04:10:17.950 --> 04:10:17.960 align:start position:0%
fically based reading systems would then
 
04:10:22.189 --> 04:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
also update their spelling of conquered
 
04:10:25.349 --> 04:10:25.359 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire to reflect the
 
04:10:25.359 --> 04:10:28.790 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire to reflect the
pronunciation

04:10:28.790 --> 04:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:33.269 --> 04:10:33.279 align:start position:0%
um so yeah just some
 
04:10:37.950 --> 04:10:37.960 align:start position:0%
um so yeah besides um Japanese um just
 
04:10:41.070 --> 04:10:41.080 align:start position:0%
some other examples of where this could
 
04:10:44.070 --> 04:10:44.080 align:start position:0%
uh come in useful uh with the first in
 
04:10:46.269 --> 04:10:46.279 align:start position:0%
the nation presidential primary we got a
 
04:10:48.590 --> 04:10:48.600 align:start position:0%
lot of presidential candidates visit
 
04:10:51.950 --> 04:10:51.960 align:start position:0%
visiting um and they often have a hard
 
04:10:54.429 --> 04:10:54.439 align:start position:0%
time figuring out how to pronounce
 
04:10:56.429 --> 04:10:56.439 align:start position:0%
things so was just thinking this could
 
04:10:59.990 --> 04:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
help them also um tell
 
04:11:03.590 --> 04:11:03.600 align:start position:0%
marketers um when they put out phone
 
04:11:07.790 --> 04:11:07.800 align:start position:0%
calls uh often get it wrong too um and
 
04:11:10.309 --> 04:11:10.319 align:start position:0%
you heard with the Canadian Consul
 
04:11:12.590 --> 04:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
General Bernard Jordan when she spoke
 
04:11:14.710 --> 04:11:14.720 align:start position:0%
before us she mostly got it right but I
 
04:11:16.630 --> 04:11:16.640 align:start position:0%
do remember one specific instance when
 
04:11:18.070 --> 04:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
she said New
 
04:11:21.269 --> 04:11:21.279 align:start position:0%
Hampshire um and so hopefully just
 
04:11:22.750 --> 04:11:22.760 align:start position:0%
having this written down somewhere
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
official would help people preparing to
 
04:11:28.950 --> 04:11:28.960 align:start position:0%
speak before us
 
04:11:28.960 --> 04:11:33.269 align:start position:0%
speak before us
um

04:11:33.269 --> 04:11:33.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:37.870 --> 04:11:37.880 align:start position:0%
so um yeah I I will um
 
04:11:41.870 --> 04:11:41.880 align:start position:0%
admit that this is a um rather minor
 
04:11:44.990 --> 04:11:45.000 align:start position:0%
thing to have a bill about um you know
 
04:11:47.910 --> 04:11:47.920 align:start position:0%
one question is well what why are you
 
04:11:50.630 --> 04:11:50.640 align:start position:0%
wasting your time on this bill when
 
04:11:53.670 --> 04:11:53.680 align:start position:0%
there's other more important stuff um so
 
04:11:56.030 --> 04:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
if I have a few responses to that
 
04:11:58.550 --> 04:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
question um one would be well you could
 
04:12:00.750 --> 04:12:00.760 align:start position:0%
also make that argument about anything
 
04:12:05.109 --> 04:12:05.119 align:start position:0%
else that's already in RSA 3 um you know
 
04:12:07.790 --> 04:12:07.800 align:start position:0%
why waste half time why waste time on
 
04:12:12.910 --> 04:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
having a state fruit or something um and
 
04:12:14.990 --> 04:12:15.000 align:start position:0%
also um it didn't actually take that
 
04:12:17.590 --> 04:12:17.600 align:start position:0%
long uh and we're a part-time
 
04:12:22.389 --> 04:12:22.399 align:start position:0%
legislature with 400 members so if you
 
04:12:25.590 --> 04:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
multiply um the amount of time available
 
04:12:30.030 --> 04:12:30.040 align:start position:0%
to any particular one of us by 400 the
 
04:12:31.590 --> 04:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
amount of person hours that we have
 
04:12:34.870 --> 04:12:34.880 align:start position:0%
available to us is kind of a lot and I
 
04:12:36.670 --> 04:12:36.680 align:start position:0%
do actually have bills on more important
 
04:12:39.990 --> 04:12:40.000 align:start position:0%
topics too this is one of 11 lsrs I
 
04:12:41.910 --> 04:12:41.920 align:start position:0%
filed this year
 
04:12:44.990 --> 04:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
um but I do kind of try when filing
 
04:12:47.710 --> 04:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
bills to go for things that other people
 
04:12:49.910 --> 04:12:49.920 align:start position:0%
aren't also legislating about you know a
 
04:12:51.990 --> 04:12:52.000 align:start position:0%
lot of the other more important issues
 
04:12:56.910 --> 04:12:56.920 align:start position:0%
The Trenches are already dug in um and
 
04:12:58.309 --> 04:12:58.319 align:start position:0%
people have already made up their minds
 
04:13:01.750 --> 04:13:01.760 align:start position:0%
about it but um with something uh more
 
04:13:05.309 --> 04:13:05.319 align:start position:0%
minor uh like this then I think we can
 
04:13:09.309 --> 04:13:09.319 align:start position:0%
have a chance to um bring people
 
04:13:11.670 --> 04:13:11.680 align:start position:0%
together and
 
04:13:15.309 --> 04:13:15.319 align:start position:0%
um actually pass some legislation
 
04:13:18.070 --> 04:13:18.080 align:start position:0%
um and
 
04:13:21.750 --> 04:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
um oh and one more question to address
 
04:13:25.030 --> 04:13:25.040 align:start position:0%
um so yeah New Hampshire makes sense for
 
04:13:28.710 --> 04:13:28.720 align:start position:0%
us to address as state since we're the
 
04:13:30.590 --> 04:13:30.600 align:start position:0%
state legislature um I guess one
 
04:13:32.910 --> 04:13:32.920 align:start position:0%
question to kind of preemptively answer
 
04:13:35.149 --> 04:13:35.159 align:start position:0%
would be well why single out conquered
 
04:13:36.670 --> 04:13:36.680 align:start position:0%
when there are these other place
 
04:13:38.149 --> 04:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
locations names that also get
 
04:13:40.950 --> 04:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
mispronounced and I think the reason
 
04:13:44.309 --> 04:13:44.319 align:start position:0%
there is because conquer the state
 
04:13:46.950 --> 04:13:46.960 align:start position:0%
capital um so you know if the state is
 
04:13:49.389 --> 04:13:49.399 align:start position:0%
going to put its government here I think
 
04:13:53.309 --> 04:13:53.319 align:start position:0%
we do kind of um deserve a little bit
 
04:13:57.469 --> 04:13:57.479 align:start position:0%
more special consideration than
 
04:14:00.830 --> 04:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
um some of the some of the other places
 
04:14:02.830 --> 04:14:02.840 align:start position:0%
just because you know if you're telling
 
04:14:05.229 --> 04:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
people oh you need to come testify at
 
04:14:07.510 --> 04:14:07.520 align:start position:0%
the hearing and conquered like that's
 
04:14:11.309 --> 04:14:11.319 align:start position:0%
kind of a state Affair since yeah the
 
04:14:15.990 --> 04:14:16.000 align:start position:0%
state Governor is meeting here um and um
 
04:14:20.229 --> 04:14:20.239 align:start position:0%
I also noticed um in my email I um I see
 
04:14:22.670 --> 04:14:22.680 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a non-gain Amendment
 
04:14:24.910 --> 04:14:24.920 align:start position:0%
about it I won't speak directly to that
 
04:14:28.309 --> 04:14:28.319 align:start position:0%
but I will note that I just generally
 
04:14:30.790 --> 04:14:30.800 align:start position:0%
would oppose any non- gerain amendments
 
04:14:32.429 --> 04:14:32.439 align:start position:0%
on principle just because I don't think
 
04:14:32.439 --> 04:14:33.349 align:start position:0%
on principle just because I don't think
it's

04:14:33.349 --> 04:14:33.359 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:14:38.070 --> 04:14:38.080 align:start position:0%
necessary um so with that all not take
 
04:14:39.670 --> 04:14:39.680 align:start position:0%
questions oh actually wait no one more
 
04:14:44.349 --> 04:14:44.359 align:start position:0%
thing um uh um that I wanted to mention
 
04:14:47.429 --> 04:14:47.439 align:start position:0%
uh about the pronunciation um
 
04:14:49.710 --> 04:14:49.720 align:start position:0%
so uh you some of you may know the
 
04:14:52.429 --> 04:14:52.439 align:start position:0%
boners Matt and Luke boner who went to
 
04:14:54.309 --> 04:14:54.319 align:start position:0%
basketball and Matt Bonner in particular
 
04:14:56.790 --> 04:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
is known for having this shirt that says
 
04:14:59.910 --> 04:14:59.920 align:start position:0%
I came I saw I conquered and like
 
04:15:02.950 --> 04:15:02.960 align:start position:0%
conquered r as the state capital so that
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
pun that pun really only works if you
 
04:15:07.590 --> 04:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
pronounce it
 
04:15:11.710 --> 04:15:11.720 align:start position:0%
correctly um and also one more thing so
 
04:15:14.550 --> 04:15:14.560 align:start position:0%
there are four concords in the United
 
04:15:16.950 --> 04:15:16.960 align:start position:0%
States um besides the um one we're in
 
04:15:18.670 --> 04:15:18.680 align:start position:0%
now there's also one in Massachusetts
 
04:15:21.670 --> 04:15:21.680 align:start position:0%
North Carolina and California so I think
 
04:15:25.030 --> 04:15:25.040 align:start position:0%
by um specifying the pronunciation of
 
04:15:27.590 --> 04:15:27.600 align:start position:0%
ours specifically that should help
 
04:15:29.710 --> 04:15:29.720 align:start position:0%
people tell them apart a little bit
 
04:15:32.590 --> 04:15:32.600 align:start position:0%
better so maybe we won't get as many
 
04:15:34.109 --> 04:15:34.119 align:start position:0%
people coming here asking where the
 
04:15:37.670 --> 04:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
battlefield is um so
 
04:15:39.109 --> 04:15:39.119 align:start position:0%
yeah that's what I have to say about
 
04:15:41.670 --> 04:15:41.680 align:start position:0%
this bill and I'll take questions out
 
04:15:44.349 --> 04:15:44.359 align:start position:0%
thank you um representative Shu has a
 
04:15:47.109 --> 04:15:47.119 align:start position:0%
question and then representative Brown
 
04:15:49.630 --> 04:15:49.640 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um I thank you for
 
04:15:52.469 --> 04:15:52.479 align:start position:0%
explaining your motivation I was curious
 
04:15:57.070 --> 04:15:57.080 align:start position:0%
about that but um I do have concerns um
 
04:15:59.790 --> 04:15:59.800 align:start position:0%
I'm of a considerably older
 
04:16:03.030 --> 04:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
generation and uh we have a lot of old
 
04:16:05.630 --> 04:16:05.640 align:start position:0%
Yankee folks who still live in New
 
04:16:08.670 --> 04:16:08.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and they pronounce it New
 
04:16:12.469 --> 04:16:12.479 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and Conquer and I'm curious if
 
04:16:15.990 --> 04:16:16.000 align:start position:0%
you discuss this idea with any of them
 
04:16:18.030 --> 04:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you I'm fearful that some of
 
04:16:21.550 --> 04:16:21.560 align:start position:0%
them may be offended if we mandated a
 
04:16:24.590 --> 04:16:24.600 align:start position:0%
specific pronunciation that doesn't jive
 
04:16:26.950 --> 04:16:26.960 align:start position:0%
with with their
 
04:16:30.670 --> 04:16:30.680 align:start position:0%
Heritage well again it's not mandating
 
04:16:32.429 --> 04:16:32.439 align:start position:0%
um it's not it's not saying that anyone
 
04:16:34.149 --> 04:16:34.159 align:start position:0%
has to use this since it's going in the
 
04:16:37.950 --> 04:16:37.960 align:start position:0%
state um symbol section so and yeah I
 
04:16:42.710 --> 04:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
just compare this back to um some of the
 
04:16:44.990 --> 04:16:45.000 align:start position:0%
other state symbols you know with the
 
04:16:49.030 --> 04:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
state fruit um of choosing Pumpkins I'm
 
04:16:51.910 --> 04:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
sure some apple farmers were offended by
 
04:16:51.920 --> 04:16:53.149 align:start position:0%
sure some apple farmers were offended by
that

04:16:53.149 --> 04:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:16:57.349 --> 04:16:57.359 align:start position:0%
um and um I mean I I did do some
 
04:17:01.670 --> 04:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
research on this um to see um what's
 
04:17:04.269 --> 04:17:04.279 align:start position:0%
already used in some places
 
04:17:07.990 --> 04:17:08.000 align:start position:0%
um and yeah uh
 
04:17:11.469 --> 04:17:11.479 align:start position:0%
that this is what I found when looking
 
04:17:15.830 --> 04:17:15.840 align:start position:0%
it up um as part of my research
 
04:17:19.229 --> 04:17:19.239 align:start position:0%
process thank you represent Brown uh
 
04:17:21.229 --> 04:17:21.239 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thanks for
 
04:17:22.590 --> 04:17:22.600 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
04:17:26.349 --> 04:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
question um RSA
 
04:17:28.950 --> 04:17:28.960 align:start position:0%
331 at this time is the state spider so
 
04:17:30.429 --> 04:17:30.439 align:start position:0%
I don't know if I will let number that
 
04:17:32.229 --> 04:17:32.239 align:start position:0%
wrong or if I'm looking at it
 
04:17:35.550 --> 04:17:35.560 align:start position:0%
incorrectly um yeah it may very well be
 
04:17:38.309 --> 04:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
a numbering mistake I I just um yeah
 
04:17:40.790 --> 04:17:40.800 align:start position:0%
this is just whatas drafted for me so if
 
04:17:43.030 --> 04:17:43.040 align:start position:0%
the section needs to be renumbered then
 
04:17:46.429 --> 04:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
I'm perfectly okay with that thank
 
04:17:50.389 --> 04:17:50.399 align:start position:0%
you very good represent man py thank you
 
04:17:51.910 --> 04:17:51.920 align:start position:0%
madam chair thank you for taking my
 
04:17:55.590 --> 04:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
question um this will be a audio clip
 
04:17:58.910 --> 04:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
that would be pronounced in fanatic with
 
04:18:01.429 --> 04:18:01.439 align:start position:0%
the fanatic inter International fanatic
 
04:18:05.710 --> 04:18:05.720 align:start position:0%
alphabet using that or is it just a
 
04:18:08.790 --> 04:18:08.800 align:start position:0%
click just written in the
 
04:18:12.870 --> 04:18:12.880 align:start position:0%
International Phonetic Alphabet well so
 
04:18:17.990 --> 04:18:18.000 align:start position:0%
um yeah I mean since the way we do our
 
04:18:21.070 --> 04:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
legislation still is primarily on paper
 
04:18:24.590 --> 04:18:24.600 align:start position:0%
you can't really put audio clips onto
 
04:18:28.830 --> 04:18:28.840 align:start position:0%
paper but I would think like um yeah um
 
04:18:30.309 --> 04:18:30.319 align:start position:0%
that that this does actually kind of
 
04:18:32.030 --> 04:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
bring up another reason I filed this
 
04:18:37.710 --> 04:18:37.720 align:start position:0%
bill was um just to uh see if the
 
04:18:40.389 --> 04:18:40.399 align:start position:0%
legislation software that OS uses could
 
04:18:43.590 --> 04:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
render the characters properly um and I
 
04:18:47.030 --> 04:18:47.040 align:start position:0%
think um what one kind of BR bigger
 
04:18:48.790 --> 04:18:48.800 align:start position:0%
picture goal that I'd like to see
 
04:18:52.030 --> 04:18:52.040 align:start position:0%
eventually is moving to digital native
 
04:18:54.510 --> 04:18:54.520 align:start position:0%
legislating uh where you could include
 
04:18:58.750 --> 04:18:58.760 align:start position:0%
things like um audio and stuff in the
 
04:19:01.990 --> 04:19:02.000 align:start position:0%
legislation um and yeah if the state
 
04:19:07.309 --> 04:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
wants to put an audio clip um on the
 
04:19:11.229 --> 04:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
website um yeah to go with this then
 
04:19:14.070 --> 04:19:14.080 align:start position:0%
yeah I would appreciate that but um as
 
04:19:16.870 --> 04:19:16.880 align:start position:0%
long as we also have to have uh paper
 
04:19:20.630 --> 04:19:20.640 align:start position:0%
copies as well then uh we need some sort
 
04:19:22.149 --> 04:19:22.159 align:start position:0%
we need to be putting in some sort of
 
04:19:24.590 --> 04:19:24.600 align:start position:0%
written format
 
04:19:26.910 --> 04:19:26.920 align:start position:0%

other state agencies archives doesn't
 
04:20:35.309 --> 04:20:35.319 align:start position:0%

I'll speak to the amendment first I
 
04:20:40.510 --> 04:20:40.520 align:start position:0%
apologize yeah that's okay um
 
04:20:43.389 --> 04:20:43.399 align:start position:0%
first what the amendment does uh it
 
04:20:47.830 --> 04:20:47.840 align:start position:0%
strikes out two stock clerk 2 positions
 
04:20:51.670 --> 04:20:51.680 align:start position:0%
and makes them back to uh stock clerk
 
04:20:54.870 --> 04:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
3 um as you heard one of the uh
 
04:20:57.030 --> 04:20:57.040 align:start position:0%
positions is currently vacant um they're
 
04:20:58.910 --> 04:20:58.920 align:start position:0%
having trouble filling these positions
 
04:21:02.309 --> 04:21:02.319 align:start position:0%
and they're hoping with a um little bit
 
04:21:04.269 --> 04:21:04.279 align:start position:0%
of a salary upgrade they can get these
 
04:21:05.990 --> 04:21:06.000 align:start position:0%
positions filled um they're important
 
04:21:07.590 --> 04:21:07.600 align:start position:0%
positions they're the ones that maintain
 
04:21:10.429 --> 04:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
the stock and you know the clerks and
 
04:21:12.750 --> 04:21:12.760 align:start position:0%
working in behind the scenes um so
 
04:21:14.109 --> 04:21:14.119 align:start position:0%
they're hoping with this little salary
 
04:21:16.269 --> 04:21:16.279 align:start position:0%
bump that they can get those position
 
04:21:18.710 --> 04:21:18.720 align:start position:0%
that position filled um in doing so so
 
04:21:20.750 --> 04:21:20.760 align:start position:0%
that's why they brought forward this
 
04:21:22.750 --> 04:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
amendment all
 
04:21:25.349 --> 04:21:25.359 align:start position:0%
right and despite the reference the
 
04:21:27.149 --> 04:21:27.159 align:start position:0%
governor drawing out a warrant the
 
04:21:29.710 --> 04:21:29.720 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State testified that they
 
04:21:31.269 --> 04:21:31.279 align:start position:0%
had enough money in their budget to
 
04:21:33.030 --> 04:21:33.040 align:start position:0%
cover it correct and they said that
 
04:21:35.469 --> 04:21:35.479 align:start position:0%
would be roughly under $55,000 to cover
 
04:21:38.309 --> 04:21:38.319 align:start position:0%
those two positions
 
04:21:41.510 --> 04:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
okay representative man py thank you
 
04:21:44.990 --> 04:21:45.000 align:start position:0%
madam chair So currently they do accept
 
04:21:48.349 --> 04:21:48.359 align:start position:0%
but it's not done in a they do accept
 
04:21:49.670 --> 04:21:49.680 align:start position:0%
donation we're talking about the
 
04:21:51.750 --> 04:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
amendment right now
 
04:21:54.349 --> 04:21:54.359 align:start position:0%
okay we'll get back back to the bill
 
04:21:56.429 --> 04:21:56.439 align:start position:0%
after we just decide on the amendment
 
04:21:58.750 --> 04:21:58.760 align:start position:0%
representative leus yeah just to make it
 
04:22:01.349 --> 04:22:01.359 align:start position:0%
clear the 5,000 is the additional cost
 
04:22:03.510 --> 04:22:03.520 align:start position:0%
because of the increase uh in the salary
 
04:22:06.710 --> 04:22:06.720 align:start position:0%
range so they're getting rid of uh two
 
04:22:08.510 --> 04:22:08.520 align:start position:0%
at a lower position and creating two at
 
04:22:10.469 --> 04:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
a little higher and they said the total
 
04:22:13.269 --> 04:22:13.279 align:start position:0%
for the two positions is around
 
04:22:13.279 --> 04:22:17.030 align:start position:0%
for the two positions is around
5,000

04:22:17.030 --> 04:22:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:17.040 --> 04:22:18.750 align:start position:0%
 
okay

04:22:18.750 --> 04:22:18.760 align:start position:0%
okay
 
04:22:23.149 --> 04:22:23.159 align:start position:0%
yes Brown thank you madam chair so I I
 
04:22:24.790 --> 04:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
don't know if representative goalie
 
04:22:26.469 --> 04:22:26.479 align:start position:0%
knows this I probably should have asked
 
04:22:29.149 --> 04:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
the the folks that were
 
04:22:31.910 --> 04:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
here these two positions are needed to
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
handle the extra work in receiving
 
04:22:35.359 --> 04:22:37.149 align:start position:0%
handle the extra work in receiving
donations

04:22:37.149 --> 04:22:37.159 align:start position:0%
donations
 
04:22:37.159 --> 04:22:39.109 align:start position:0%
donations
no

04:22:39.109 --> 04:22:39.119 align:start position:0%
no
 
04:22:42.510 --> 04:22:42.520 align:start position:0%
no there are turn two current these two
 
04:22:44.189 --> 04:22:44.199 align:start position:0%
current positions are in place this
 
04:22:46.670 --> 04:22:46.680 align:start position:0%
removes those two positions creates two
 
04:22:49.469 --> 04:22:49.479 align:start position:0%
new positions at a higher grade okay so
 
04:22:53.590 --> 04:22:53.600 align:start position:0%
as a followup followup it's almost two
 
04:22:53.600 --> 04:22:54.870 align:start position:0%
as a followup followup it's almost two
separate

04:22:54.870 --> 04:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
separate
 
04:23:00.790 --> 04:23:00.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:03.149 --> 04:23:03.159 align:start position:0%
you so I hope this is considered a
 
04:23:05.510 --> 04:23:05.520 align:start position:0%
Germain Amendment but representative
 
04:23:07.790 --> 04:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
laus right I think the as I understand I
 
04:23:09.309 --> 04:23:09.319 align:start position:0%
think the point was at the current
 
04:23:10.790 --> 04:23:10.800 align:start position:0%
salary range they have not been able to
 
04:23:12.189 --> 04:23:12.199 align:start position:0%
fill the positions and they're hoping to
 
04:23:15.070 --> 04:23:15.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:17.870 --> 04:23:17.880 align:start position:0%
so yeah they're they're hoping that
 
04:23:20.389 --> 04:23:20.399 align:start position:0%
there would be more uh more donations
 
04:23:23.950 --> 04:23:23.960 align:start position:0%
coming in but one never
 
04:23:31.149 --> 04:23:31.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:34.910 --> 04:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
else all right we'll uh we'll see if we
 
04:23:37.630 --> 04:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
if it's judged non but it looks pretty
 
04:23:39.630 --> 04:23:39.640 align:start position:0%
germine to me
 
04:23:42.870 --> 04:23:42.880 align:start position:0%
so all right anyone
 
04:23:45.469 --> 04:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
else okay in that case the motion is
 
04:23:47.429 --> 04:23:47.439 align:start position:0%
madam chair yes that's that's not what
 
04:23:49.109 --> 04:23:49.119 align:start position:0%
it was meaning at
 
04:23:51.429 --> 04:23:51.439 align:start position:0%
all that it was non gerain I didn't mean
 
04:23:53.229 --> 04:23:53.239 align:start position:0%
that but that's not okay well that's
 
04:23:56.429 --> 04:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
fine it is you know only marginally
 
04:24:01.710 --> 04:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:04.590 --> 04:24:04.600 align:start position:0%
okay I'm trying to to run this as an
 
04:24:08.710 --> 04:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:11.030 --> 04:24:11.040 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is to accept
 
04:24:11.040 --> 04:24:12.950 align:start position:0%
okay so the motion is to accept

okay any further uh
 
04:25:03.870 --> 04:25:03.880 align:start position:0%
discussion repres golden thank you madam
 
04:25:05.630 --> 04:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
chair I was starting to State a little
 
04:25:08.590 --> 04:25:08.600 align:start position:0%
ahead of my self that this just gives uh
 
04:25:10.389 --> 04:25:10.399 align:start position:0%
them the ability to do what most other
 
04:25:12.550 --> 04:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
state agencies currently do now and this
 
04:25:14.790 --> 04:25:14.800 align:start position:0%
codifies it into statute to accept those
 
04:25:18.710 --> 04:25:18.720 align:start position:0%
donations and goods okay there's a man
 
04:25:21.630 --> 04:25:21.640 align:start position:0%
yeah so just to follow with that so
 
04:25:23.870 --> 04:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
currently they do accept they do have it
 
04:25:25.750 --> 04:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
but may put it in the statute so it
 
04:25:28.630 --> 04:25:28.640 align:start position:0%
becomes official is what we're doing
 
04:25:33.070 --> 04:25:33.080 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative gold as as
 
04:25:35.550 --> 04:25:35.560 align:start position:0%
I understand there are some statutes
 
04:25:37.870 --> 04:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
that require required various agencies
 
04:25:40.910 --> 04:25:40.920 align:start position:0%
to put their records there but this is
 
04:25:43.870 --> 04:25:43.880 align:start position:0%
just giving them the ability officially
 
04:25:46.109 --> 04:25:46.119 align:start position:0%
to accept them so the previous behaviors
 
04:25:48.870 --> 04:25:48.880 align:start position:0%
haven't been outside of legislation
 
04:25:52.229 --> 04:25:52.239 align:start position:0%
always but well but I'm sure they have
 
04:25:55.670 --> 04:25:55.680 align:start position:0%
donations from private parties and so
 
04:25:58.189 --> 04:25:58.199 align:start position:0%
forth that they've accepted as being
 
04:25:58.199 --> 04:26:00.149 align:start position:0%
forth that they've accepted as being
relevant

04:26:00.149 --> 04:26:00.159 align:start position:0%
relevant
 
04:26:02.790 --> 04:26:02.800 align:start position:0%
but when the new
 
04:26:05.389 --> 04:26:05.399 align:start position:0%
archivist found out that the weren't
 
04:26:07.469 --> 04:26:07.479 align:start position:0%
they weren't
 
04:26:10.149 --> 04:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
authorized to do
 
04:26:13.750 --> 04:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
so yeah exactly all right any does
 
04:26:15.070 --> 04:26:15.080 align:start position:0%
anyone else have a comment
 
04:26:16.349 --> 04:26:16.359 align:start position:0%
representative schmidth I should have
 
04:26:19.229 --> 04:26:19.239 align:start position:0%
got you soon so I mean
 
04:26:23.349 --> 04:26:23.359 align:start position:0%
the the situation has been that they
 
04:26:26.429 --> 04:26:26.439 align:start position:0%
were obviously occasionally given things
 
04:26:28.670 --> 04:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
donated things and so forth they
 
04:26:31.910 --> 04:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
accepted them because seemed normal
 
04:26:34.149 --> 04:26:34.159 align:start position:0%
natural and so forth but it was always a
 
04:26:36.510 --> 04:26:36.520 align:start position:0%
situation where somebody would say would
 
04:26:38.149 --> 04:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
well what's the deal with that people
 
04:26:41.070 --> 04:26:41.080 align:start position:0%
would go well that's perfectly
 
04:26:43.389 --> 04:26:43.399 align:start position:0%
obvious we have all kinds of things in
 
04:26:45.910 --> 04:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
statutes like addresses where things get
 
04:26:48.189 --> 04:26:48.199 align:start position:0%
sent and every once in a while that
 
04:26:50.990 --> 04:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
address goes out of currency and so
 
04:26:52.469 --> 04:26:52.479 align:start position:0%
forth and then we have to change the
 
04:26:55.790 --> 04:26:55.800 align:start position:0%
statute to either take the an address
 
04:26:59.070 --> 04:26:59.080 align:start position:0%
out or to correct the address but it has
 
04:27:01.030 --> 04:27:01.040 align:start position:0%
to be changed because otherwise it's
 
04:27:04.070 --> 04:27:04.080 align:start position:0%
wrong in the statute so it's strictly
 
04:27:06.710 --> 04:27:06.720 align:start position:0%
ministerial but that's what makes more
 
04:27:08.950 --> 04:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
sense to have it resolved rather than
 
04:27:10.990 --> 04:27:11.000 align:start position:0%
well it's
 
04:27:15.670 --> 04:27:15.680 align:start position:0%
obvious exactly and any other comments
 
04:27:18.149 --> 04:27:18.159 align:start position:0%
questions okay the motion is ought to
 
04:27:21.670 --> 04:27:21.680 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment on House Bill 1433
 
04:27:21.680 --> 04:27:22.990 align:start position:0%
pass with Amendment on House Bill 1433
and

04:27:22.990 --> 04:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:27:25.389 --> 04:27:25.399 align:start position:0%

okay the motion passes is there any
 
04:27:53.389 --> 04:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
objection to

consent representative goalie uh you
 
04:28:00.309 --> 04:28:00.319 align:start position:0%
could get ited fairly soon I'd
 
04:28:00.319 --> 04:28:02.030 align:start position:0%
could get ited fairly soon I'd
appreciate

04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
04:28:04.229 --> 04:28:04.239 align:start position:0%
it all
 
04:28:08.149 --> 04:28:08.159 align:start position:0%
right and I would like to go on to the
 
04:28:12.990 --> 04:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
other simple one which is how cacr
 
04:28:17.510 --> 04:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
11 does someone have a motion on that
 
04:28:20.950 --> 04:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:23.590 --> 04:28:23.600 align:start position:0%
pass all
 
04:28:27.830 --> 04:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:27.840 --> 04:28:29.349 align:start position:0%
 
second

04:28:29.349 --> 04:28:29.359 align:start position:0%
second
 
04:28:34.790 --> 04:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:34.800 --> 04:28:40.750 align:start position:0%
 
Brown

04:28:40.750 --> 04:28:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:45.309 --> 04:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
okay it seems to me that this bill makes
 
04:28:47.429 --> 04:28:47.439 align:start position:0%
a lot of sense in terms
 
04:28:50.750 --> 04:28:50.760 align:start position:0%
of those candidates who are holding a an
 
04:28:54.109 --> 04:28:54.119 align:start position:0%
elected position who whose age is going
 
04:28:57.790 --> 04:28:57.800 align:start position:0%
to change during the course of their um
 
04:28:58.790 --> 04:28:58.800 align:start position:0%
their current
 
04:29:00.750 --> 04:29:00.760 align:start position:0%
engagement they're prevented from
 
04:29:04.229 --> 04:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
continuing on beyond the the age limit
 
04:29:05.790 --> 04:29:05.800 align:start position:0%
because they cannot run for real
 
04:29:08.429 --> 04:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
election so it's it's a matter of a year
 
04:29:10.349 --> 04:29:10.359 align:start position:0%
or two to let somebody finish out their
 
04:29:12.790 --> 04:29:12.800 align:start position:0%
term and it makes sense to me
 
04:29:15.510 --> 04:29:15.520 align:start position:0%
representative Brown you wish to comment
 
04:29:17.710 --> 04:29:17.720 align:start position:0%
on a second no
 
04:29:20.070 --> 04:29:20.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative Schmidt and then
 
04:29:23.429 --> 04:29:23.439 align:start position:0%
Dolan and then Son thank you ordinarily
 
04:29:26.590 --> 04:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
I would have seconded this this cacr
 
04:29:31.189 --> 04:29:31.199 align:start position:0%
motion but um I I deferred specifically
 
04:29:33.429 --> 04:29:33.439 align:start position:0%
and I would speak to it and that is in
 
04:29:35.870 --> 04:29:35.880 align:start position:0%
straford County we currently have an
 
04:29:35.880 --> 04:29:36.790 align:start position:0%
straford County we currently have an
acting

04:29:36.790 --> 04:29:36.800 align:start position:0%
acting
 
04:29:40.349 --> 04:29:40.359 align:start position:0%
Sheriff U because I'm sure many of you
 
04:29:43.109 --> 04:29:43.119 align:start position:0%
are aware of the very disgraceful
 
04:29:46.630 --> 04:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
situation with former High Sheriff Mark
 
04:29:53.309 --> 04:29:53.319 align:start position:0%
Brave um he uh was put into a an
 
04:29:56.830 --> 04:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
administrative U leave situation at the
 
04:29:59.750 --> 04:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
urging of the at the urging of the
 
04:30:02.429 --> 04:30:02.439 align:start position:0%
Commissioners because he really
 
04:30:03.550 --> 04:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have
 
04:30:06.469 --> 04:30:06.479 align:start position:0%
been carrying out the function of the
 
04:30:09.349 --> 04:30:09.359 align:start position:0%
sheriff given his legal issues uh and
 
04:30:13.389 --> 04:30:13.399 align:start position:0%
the department was in so bad shape um
 
04:30:16.950 --> 04:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
and um so the Commissioners got him to
 
04:30:20.269 --> 04:30:20.279 align:start position:0%
accept this administrative leave and and
 
04:30:23.550 --> 04:30:23.560 align:start position:0%
uh one of the able members of the law
 
04:30:25.189 --> 04:30:25.199 align:start position:0%
enforcement in Stafford County step
 
04:30:29.149 --> 04:30:29.159 align:start position:0%
forward to to become the acting sheriff
 
04:30:31.710 --> 04:30:31.720 align:start position:0%
and that was fine as long as uh as long
 
04:30:33.309 --> 04:30:33.319 align:start position:0%
as everything was kind of like in
 
04:30:36.830 --> 04:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
suspended animation there but then When
 
04:30:39.870 --> 04:30:39.880 align:start position:0%
U Mark Brave moved out of state that
 
04:30:42.070 --> 04:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
issue came up what what are the
 
04:30:44.870 --> 04:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
qualifications you have to live in the
 
04:30:46.950 --> 04:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
county and he actually moved out of the
 
04:30:49.870 --> 04:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
state and paid his next year's rent in
 
04:30:53.189 --> 04:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
advance that kind of suggest a certain
 
04:30:57.189 --> 04:30:57.199 align:start position:0%
long-term plan right um and and at that
 
04:31:00.710 --> 04:31:00.720 align:start position:0%
point they said now you now you're you
 
04:31:02.429 --> 04:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
have to
 
04:31:06.149 --> 04:31:06.159 align:start position:0%
resign uh and so when he did now the the
 
04:31:08.710 --> 04:31:08.720 align:start position:0%
delegation has to elect in the
 
04:31:10.670 --> 04:31:10.680 align:start position:0%
circumstance has to elect the
 
04:31:12.070 --> 04:31:12.080 align:start position:0%
replacement because that's what the
 
04:31:15.830 --> 04:31:15.840 align:start position:0%
statute requires uh and the individual
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
involved is the only person who applied
 
04:31:19.630 --> 04:31:19.640 align:start position:0%
for the position so we're going to be
 
04:31:21.670 --> 04:31:21.680 align:start position:0%
electing him but the point is he's going
 
04:31:25.070 --> 04:31:25.080 align:start position:0%
to turn 70 on October
 
04:31:28.149 --> 04:31:28.159 align:start position:0%
24th so that means that under the law
 
04:31:30.389 --> 04:31:30.399 align:start position:0%
when October if we do elect him which
 
04:31:33.590 --> 04:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
we'll do in a week or so when when when
 
04:31:36.750 --> 04:31:36.760 align:start position:0%
October 24th become comes so along he's
 
04:31:39.590 --> 04:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
automatically out there will be no
 
04:31:41.109 --> 04:31:41.119 align:start position:0%
Sheriff you know he doesn't have to
 
04:31:44.229 --> 04:31:44.239 align:start position:0%
resign he's just gone okay now for a
 
04:31:46.109 --> 04:31:46.119 align:start position:0%
week which is what it will be until the
 
04:31:49.790 --> 04:31:49.800 align:start position:0%
next election nobody's will have an
 
04:31:52.309 --> 04:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
somebody will act for for that week but
 
04:31:55.429 --> 04:31:55.439 align:start position:0%
the point is that um here's somebody
 
04:31:57.269 --> 04:31:57.279 align:start position:0%
who's eminently qualified who's doing an
 
04:31:58.790 --> 04:31:58.800 align:start position:0%
excellent job we're going to elect him
 
04:32:01.870 --> 04:32:01.880 align:start position:0%
to be Sheriff he's only going to
 
04:32:06.469 --> 04:32:06.479 align:start position:0%
have 10 months or so in office uh but in
 
04:32:07.870 --> 04:32:07.880 align:start position:0%
the case of Rockham County where they
 
04:32:11.990 --> 04:32:12.000 align:start position:0%
have a four-year term Sheriff MOS I
 
04:32:16.109 --> 04:32:16.119 align:start position:0%
think he pronounces it um he he here
 
04:32:18.590 --> 04:32:18.600 align:start position:0%
gave a gave us a good reason why it's
 
04:32:21.950 --> 04:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
not a good idea to have them
 
04:32:24.550 --> 04:32:24.560 align:start position:0%
automatically removed from office the
 
04:32:27.630 --> 04:32:27.640 align:start position:0%
moment they turn 70 and and we're also
 
04:32:30.870 --> 04:32:30.880 align:start position:0%
at a point where 70 ain't no age at all
 
04:32:32.830 --> 04:32:32.840 align:start position:0%
for most
 
04:32:36.070 --> 04:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
people I'm going like 70-year-old nice
 
04:32:36.080 --> 04:32:37.630 align:start position:0%
people I'm going like 70-year-old nice
young

04:32:37.630 --> 04:32:37.640 align:start position:0%
young
 
04:32:41.510 --> 04:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
man okay representative Dolan I wave you
 
04:32:43.269 --> 04:32:43.279 align:start position:0%
wave off okay representative Simon and
 
04:32:46.309 --> 04:32:46.319 align:start position:0%
then laus thank you madam chair um in
 
04:32:47.830 --> 04:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
principle according to the testimony
 
04:32:49.309 --> 04:32:49.319 align:start position:0%
heard I'm not sure that I'm opposed to
 
04:32:50.710 --> 04:32:50.720 align:start position:0%
the bill I just want to make sure I
 
04:32:52.510 --> 04:32:52.520 align:start position:0%
understand completely what it is that
 
04:32:56.109 --> 04:32:56.119 align:start position:0%
we're voting on um so and it's part of
 
04:32:58.550 --> 04:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
my ignorance on this but who determines
 
04:33:01.429 --> 04:33:01.439 align:start position:0%
the length of term for these positions
 
04:33:03.070 --> 04:33:03.080 align:start position:0%
it's in statute it's in statute so it
 
04:33:04.310 --> 04:33:04.320 align:start position:0%
would have to come through us for a law
 
04:33:06.709 --> 04:33:06.719 align:start position:0%
change CU once we change it we could
 
04:33:08.910 --> 04:33:08.920 align:start position:0%
theoretically anyway change the length
 
04:33:10.349 --> 04:33:10.359 align:start position:0%
of the term and somebody could start at
 
04:33:12.230 --> 04:33:12.240 align:start position:0%
age 69 and we change it to a 10-year
 
04:33:14.670 --> 04:33:14.680 align:start position:0%
term and they could stay in until they
 
04:33:19.029 --> 04:33:19.039 align:start position:0%
were 79 um because there is a hard line
 
04:33:20.709 --> 04:33:20.719 align:start position:0%
like there's a hard line in this
 
04:33:20.719 --> 04:33:22.230 align:start position:0%
like there's a hard line in this
particular

04:33:22.230 --> 04:33:22.240 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:33:24.390 --> 04:33:24.400 align:start position:0%
constitutional statute or the
 
04:33:27.390 --> 04:33:27.400 align:start position:0%
Constitution so uh I do have maybe a
 
04:33:30.189 --> 04:33:30.199 align:start position:0%
little bit of a concern about that but
 
04:33:32.470 --> 04:33:32.480 align:start position:0%
um it being in statute at least it would
 
04:33:34.670 --> 04:33:34.680 align:start position:0%
have to come through us I suppose not
 
04:33:37.551 --> 04:33:37.561 align:start position:0%
nine of the sheriffs serve twoyear terms
 
04:33:39.510 --> 04:33:39.520 align:start position:0%
and one serves a four-year
 
04:33:42.510 --> 04:33:42.520 align:start position:0%
term representative leus and then sh it
 
04:33:44.189 --> 04:33:44.199 align:start position:0%
yeah I mean I don't feel strongly but I
 
04:33:46.990 --> 04:33:47.000 align:start position:0%
I really don't like this um partly the
 
04:33:49.429 --> 04:33:49.439 align:start position:0%
concern that rep Simon raised U and I'd
 
04:33:51.830 --> 04:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
have less of a concern if in the
 
04:33:54.429 --> 04:33:54.439 align:start position:0%
amendment it said to two years but uh
 
04:33:56.551 --> 04:33:56.561 align:start position:0%
the other part of it is you this is I
 
04:33:58.349 --> 04:33:58.359 align:start position:0%
know it applies in other cases but at
 
04:34:00.990 --> 04:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
this point we're basically not only
 
04:34:02.429 --> 04:34:02.439 align:start position:0%
making a bill but proposing a
 
04:34:03.869 --> 04:34:03.879 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment for the moment
 
04:34:06.670 --> 04:34:06.680 align:start position:0%
one person and I'm I'm not terribly fond
 
04:34:09.390 --> 04:34:09.400 align:start position:0%
of that but um I may vote against I
 
04:34:10.830 --> 04:34:10.840 align:start position:0%
don't know but if I certainly wouldn't
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
object to consent if that's the
 
04:34:15.869 --> 04:34:15.879 align:start position:0%
consensus I don't believe cacs can go on
 
04:34:18.230 --> 04:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
consent anyway right sorry
 
04:34:20.789 --> 04:34:20.799 align:start position:0%
representative Shu thank you madam chair
 
04:34:22.789 --> 04:34:22.799 align:start position:0%
um I'll just point out I think we're all
 
04:34:26.590 --> 04:34:26.600 align:start position:0%
aware of the um shortage in law
 
04:34:29.830 --> 04:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
enforcement officers in the state and
 
04:34:32.470 --> 04:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
the pool of people who run for Sheriff
 
04:34:37.189 --> 04:34:37.199 align:start position:0%
are traditionally um I say retired
 
04:34:40.551 --> 04:34:40.561 align:start position:0%
officers or retired sheriff's deputies
 
04:34:42.590 --> 04:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
which automatically moves them into an
 
04:34:46.230 --> 04:34:46.240 align:start position:0%
older category so I think just making
 
04:34:48.869 --> 04:34:48.879 align:start position:0%
this concession and and for all the
 
04:34:51.429 --> 04:34:51.439 align:start position:0%
counties except one currently it would
 
04:34:54.070 --> 04:34:54.080 align:start position:0%
just be like another year basically
 
04:34:56.830 --> 04:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
added uh that they would be eligible to
 
04:34:59.269 --> 04:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
serve so I'm in favor of
 
04:35:03.429 --> 04:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
this okay repres represent gold I would
 
04:35:05.709 --> 04:35:05.719 align:start position:0%
just quickly respond to represent
 
04:35:09.029 --> 04:35:09.039 align:start position:0%
Simon's concern that certainly if there
 
04:35:13.429 --> 04:35:13.439 align:start position:0%
was a a bill to lengthen the term that
 
04:35:16.429 --> 04:35:16.439 align:start position:0%
the issue of the age could be taken up
 
04:35:18.750 --> 04:35:18.760 align:start position:0%
at that time you know both things could
 
04:35:21.230 --> 04:35:21.240 align:start position:0%
happen lengthen the term and put that
 
04:35:23.869 --> 04:35:23.879 align:start position:0%
hard stop
 
04:35:26.789 --> 04:35:26.799 align:start position:0%
in okay same folks as always
 
04:35:30.150 --> 04:35:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative Manti thank you Madame CH
 
04:35:32.990 --> 04:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
Mike I was just surprised to see that
 
04:35:35.629 --> 04:35:35.639 align:start position:0%
the sheriff need not be of law
 
04:35:38.629 --> 04:35:38.639 align:start position:0%
enforcement and anybody can do so it's
 
04:35:43.470 --> 04:35:43.480 align:start position:0%
just opens it up for anyone who is 69 or
 
04:35:47.789 --> 04:35:47.799 align:start position:0%
70 and can have it as a retirement job
 
04:35:51.429 --> 04:35:51.439 align:start position:0%
so yes representative
 
04:35:51.439 --> 04:35:53.510 align:start position:0%
so yes representative
uh

04:35:53.510 --> 04:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:35:56.910 --> 04:35:56.920 align:start position:0%
Schmid okay so so the issue is that
 
04:35:59.150 --> 04:35:59.160 align:start position:0%
whether you like it or not and we in
 
04:36:02.230 --> 04:36:02.240 align:start position:0%
represent Le's position is uh is is
 
04:36:04.709 --> 04:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
worth some discussion uh I didn't want
 
04:36:06.910 --> 04:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
to get into before but but I was aware
 
04:36:09.510 --> 04:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
of this thing and that is not so much
 
04:36:11.310 --> 04:36:11.320 align:start position:0%
that we're doing it for one person but
 
04:36:12.670 --> 04:36:12.680 align:start position:0%
but we're doing a Constitutional
 
04:36:15.750 --> 04:36:15.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment which means this is citizenry
 
04:36:17.709 --> 04:36:17.719 align:start position:0%
is going to be called on to make this
 
04:36:21.750 --> 04:36:21.760 align:start position:0%
change by a 2third vote right uh and and
 
04:36:25.949 --> 04:36:25.959 align:start position:0%
and the question becomes the age aspect
 
04:36:28.869 --> 04:36:28.879 align:start position:0%
or the whether you say a person should
 
04:36:31.590 --> 04:36:31.600 align:start position:0%
have some qualifications but it's a it's
 
04:36:33.789 --> 04:36:33.799 align:start position:0%
a political office it's an elective
 
04:36:37.029 --> 04:36:37.039 align:start position:0%
office and now the county sheriff is
 
04:36:38.949 --> 04:36:38.959 align:start position:0%
also an elective office but there there
 
04:36:38.959 --> 04:36:40.150 align:start position:0%
also an elective office but there there
are

04:36:40.150 --> 04:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
are
 
04:36:42.551 --> 04:36:42.561 align:start position:0%
qualifications uh no this is the county
 
04:36:44.869 --> 04:36:44.879 align:start position:0%
sheriff what sorry I meant to say that I
 
04:36:46.590 --> 04:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
if I didn't say it right the County
 
04:36:49.349 --> 04:36:49.359 align:start position:0%
Attorney is an elected position as well
 
04:36:52.150 --> 04:36:52.160 align:start position:0%
the register of deeds is a an elected
 
04:36:55.070 --> 04:36:55.080 align:start position:0%
position um and but with a county
 
04:36:57.470 --> 04:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
attorney there are some qualifications
 
04:36:59.910 --> 04:36:59.920 align:start position:0%
with Sheriff the only one is you have to
 
04:37:02.709 --> 04:37:02.719 align:start position:0%
be under 70 currently and you have to
 
04:37:05.789 --> 04:37:05.799 align:start position:0%
live in the county so it's worth
 
04:37:07.470 --> 04:37:07.480 align:start position:0%
discussing whether we want to go forward
 
04:37:09.789 --> 04:37:09.799 align:start position:0%
with the idea of making a constitutional
 
04:37:11.949 --> 04:37:11.959 align:start position:0%
change I think we should deliberate
 
04:37:14.789 --> 04:37:14.799 align:start position:0%
about that a little bit more Madam chair
 
04:37:17.230 --> 04:37:17.240 align:start position:0%
going to the time I move the question
 
04:37:20.189 --> 04:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
well I think we will postpone this we've
 
04:37:23.029 --> 04:37:23.039 align:start position:0%
raised a lot of issues and I think we
 
04:37:23.039 --> 04:37:24.670 align:start position:0%
raised a lot of issues and I think we
should

04:37:24.670 --> 04:37:24.680 align:start position:0%
should
 
04:37:27.150 --> 04:37:27.160 align:start position:0%
uh I think it would be quicker if we
 
04:37:28.869 --> 04:37:28.879 align:start position:0%
went on to the next
 
04:37:32.070 --> 04:37:32.080 align:start position:0%
bill I'll withdraw the motion so we no
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
no no we'll just recess until after
 
04:37:37.709 --> 04:37:37.719 align:start position:0%
we've dealt
 
04:37:40.590 --> 04:37:40.600 align:start position:0%
with which I hope since there's only one
 
04:37:43.551 --> 04:37:43.561 align:start position:0%
person to speak it won't be too long all
 
04:37:47.390 --> 04:37:47.400 align:start position:0%
right so clo closing the executive
 
04:37:49.789 --> 04:37:49.799 align:start position:0%
recessing the executive session open the
 
04:37:52.629 --> 04:37:52.639 align:start position:0%
hearing on cacr 21 and call
 
04:37:52.639 --> 04:37:55.789 align:start position:0%
hearing on cacr 21 and call
Representative

04:37:55.789 --> 04:37:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:58.470 --> 04:37:58.480 align:start position:0%
yella thank you thank you madam chair
 
04:38:01.349 --> 04:38:01.359 align:start position:0%
and members of the
 
04:38:07.670 --> 04:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
committee um I am here to introduce cacr
 
04:38:14.310 --> 04:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
21 um relative to the oath of City
 
04:38:14.320 --> 04:38:16.189 align:start position:0%
21 um relative to the oath of City
officers

04:38:16.189 --> 04:38:16.199 align:start position:0%
officers
 
04:38:16.199 --> 04:38:18.510 align:start position:0%
officers
um

04:38:18.510 --> 04:38:18.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:38:22.349 --> 04:38:22.359 align:start position:0%
the the the resolution proposes a
 
04:38:25.949 --> 04:38:25.959 align:start position:0%
critical provision asserting that the
 
04:38:29.709 --> 04:38:29.719 align:start position:0%
default oath of office shall be
 
04:38:31.590 --> 04:38:31.600 align:start position:0%
non-religious uh government should
 
04:38:33.629 --> 04:38:33.639 align:start position:0%
strive to be neutral in matters of
 
04:38:36.150 --> 04:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
religion treating all citizens equally
 
04:38:38.670 --> 04:38:38.680 align:start position:0%
regardless of their religious beliefs a
 
04:38:41.551 --> 04:38:41.561 align:start position:0%
non-religious oath helps maintain this
 
04:38:43.349 --> 04:38:43.359 align:start position:0%
neutrality and prevents the perception
 
04:38:45.269 --> 04:38:45.279 align:start position:0%
of favoritism towards religion over
 
04:38:45.279 --> 04:38:46.869 align:start position:0%
of favoritism towards religion over
non-religious

04:38:46.869 --> 04:38:46.879 align:start position:0%
non-religious
 
04:38:51.590 --> 04:38:51.600 align:start position:0%
people um Gallop found in 2015 that only
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
20% of New Hampshire residents consider
 
04:38:57.990 --> 04:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
themselves to be very religious um Many
 
04:39:02.670 --> 04:39:02.680 align:start position:0%
religious people would um have no issue
 
04:39:05.910 --> 04:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
under using the words uh swear under
 
04:39:08.670 --> 04:39:08.680 align:start position:0%
penalty of perjury in their oath and so
 
04:39:10.510 --> 04:39:10.520 align:start position:0%
I believe this change will overall
 
04:39:13.510 --> 04:39:13.520 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of people quote
 
04:39:16.150 --> 04:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
refusing Oaths so that they can get the
 
04:39:18.629 --> 04:39:18.639 align:start position:0%
other um
 
04:39:21.230 --> 04:39:21.240 align:start position:0%
oath I believe that adopting a
 
04:39:23.990 --> 04:39:24.000 align:start position:0%
non-religious oath as a default option
 
04:39:27.269 --> 04:39:27.279 align:start position:0%
is uh commendable a step towards
 
04:39:30.029 --> 04:39:30.039 align:start position:0%
guaranteeing inclusiveness by no longer
 
04:39:32.269 --> 04:39:32.279 align:start position:0%
assuming that the by default that
 
04:39:35.390 --> 04:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
members believe in God um by eliminating
 
04:39:37.470 --> 04:39:37.480 align:start position:0%
religious references in the default oath
 
04:39:40.110 --> 04:39:40.120 align:start position:0%
we make uh religious Expressions
 
04:39:43.708 --> 04:39:43.718 align:start position:0%
separate from governmental functions
 
04:39:46.708 --> 04:39:46.718 align:start position:0%
um the normal state of government while
 
04:39:49.070 --> 04:39:49.080 align:start position:0%
still keeping the
 
04:39:51.470 --> 04:39:51.480 align:start position:0%
option uh of the alternate oath for
 
04:39:54.868 --> 04:39:54.878 align:start position:0%
those who really want to swear to God um
 
04:39:56.510 --> 04:39:56.520 align:start position:0%
this this Constitutional Amendment
 
04:39:59.070 --> 04:39:59.080 align:start position:0%
aligns with the fundamental principles
 
04:40:01.830 --> 04:40:01.840 align:start position:0%
of equal representation representation
 
04:40:05.030 --> 04:40:05.040 align:start position:0%
and holds the cherish value of the separ
 
04:40:07.868 --> 04:40:07.878 align:start position:0%
of church and state um this amendment
 
04:40:11.830 --> 04:40:11.840 align:start position:0%
will send a strong message to our uh the
 
04:40:11.840 --> 04:40:13.110 align:start position:0%
will send a strong message to our uh the
people

04:40:13.110 --> 04:40:13.120 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:40:15.470 --> 04:40:15.480 align:start position:0%
that our government is committed to
 
04:40:17.310 --> 04:40:17.320 align:start position:0%
recognizing and respecting the diversity
 
04:40:22.350 --> 04:40:22.360 align:start position:0%
of its citizens um as an atheist I
 
04:40:25.150 --> 04:40:25.160 align:start position:0%
requested an uh an oath of office the
 
04:40:27.230 --> 04:40:27.240 align:start position:0%
first time when I swore in as a
 
04:40:29.390 --> 04:40:29.400 align:start position:0%
representative um but I would say more
 
04:40:32.550 --> 04:40:32.560 align:start position:0%
often than not when I get sworn in I
 
04:40:35.470 --> 04:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
forget to uh
 
04:40:38.788 --> 04:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
refuse and they hand me a piece of paper
 
04:40:41.868 --> 04:40:41.878 align:start position:0%
that says I swear to God and I have to
 
04:40:43.310 --> 04:40:43.320 align:start position:0%
make a decision in that moment of
 
04:40:44.830 --> 04:40:44.840 align:start position:0%
whether or not I'm going to make a big
 
04:40:48.550 --> 04:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
deal out of it and since most of my
 
04:40:50.910 --> 04:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
elected positions have been at the Town
 
04:40:53.708 --> 04:40:53.718 align:start position:0%
Office it's my town clerk that would
 
04:40:55.990 --> 04:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
have to be like run up and get another
 
04:40:58.310 --> 04:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
new piece of paper and all of that and
 
04:41:03.550 --> 04:41:03.560 align:start position:0%
I uh have not made her go do that extra
 
04:41:05.750 --> 04:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
work and so
 
04:41:10.550 --> 04:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
um I just think that it it makes sense
 
04:41:14.190 --> 04:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
like every time I I get sworn in I uh
 
04:41:17.788 --> 04:41:17.798 align:start position:0%
under the wrong oath or or oath swearing
 
04:41:21.110 --> 04:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
to God I I find it ironic that that we
 
04:41:25.150 --> 04:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
still have that be the default in the
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire or in the country
 
04:41:30.590 --> 04:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
in general uh that swearing to God
 
04:41:33.150 --> 04:41:33.160 align:start position:0%
instead of just under penalty of perjury
 
04:41:35.750 --> 04:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
so I hope you will uh support the change
 
04:41:38.110 --> 04:41:38.120 align:start position:0%
of that switch of the default not
 
04:41:40.830 --> 04:41:40.840 align:start position:0%
eliminating any any options just
 
04:41:42.868 --> 04:41:42.878 align:start position:0%
changing the default to the
 
04:41:45.910 --> 04:41:45.920 align:start position:0%
non-religious um oath of office so thank
 
04:41:47.708 --> 04:41:47.718 align:start position:0%
you and I'm happy to answer any
 
04:41:49.868 --> 04:41:49.878 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are there any
 
04:41:52.070 --> 04:41:52.080 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
04:41:56.190 --> 04:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
Schmid thank you madam chair um so I'm
 
04:41:59.628 --> 04:41:59.638 align:start position:0%
not aware of any of any oath where where
 
04:42:02.750 --> 04:42:02.760 align:start position:0%
it's where the wording is I swear to God
 
04:42:05.070 --> 04:42:05.080 align:start position:0%
I believe the Oaths I've all taken all
 
04:42:08.868 --> 04:42:08.878 align:start position:0%
said I swear or affirm some people don't
 
04:42:12.110 --> 04:42:12.120 align:start position:0%
like to use the word swear I I swear or
 
04:42:15.628 --> 04:42:15.638 align:start position:0%
affirm that I was am not swearing to God
 
04:42:18.190 --> 04:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
although the words so help me God are
 
04:42:21.590 --> 04:42:21.600 align:start position:0%
present in this particular document uh
 
04:42:23.750 --> 04:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
and I have a question about that after
 
04:42:27.910 --> 04:42:27.920 align:start position:0%
somebody else has a shot but um so I'm
 
04:42:31.030 --> 04:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
I'm I am a little bit puzzled by the
 
04:42:33.830 --> 04:42:33.840 align:start position:0%
first several instances the words so
 
04:42:38.430 --> 04:42:38.440 align:start position:0%
help me God are struck struck and um is
 
04:42:41.350 --> 04:42:41.360 align:start position:0%
substitute oath and pains of P penalties
 
04:42:43.430 --> 04:42:43.440 align:start position:0%
of perjury I think it's worthy of
 
04:42:46.510 --> 04:42:46.520 align:start position:0%
discussion and then later on is that
 
04:42:49.430 --> 04:42:49.440 align:start position:0%
language is struck and it's substituted
 
04:42:53.350 --> 04:42:53.360 align:start position:0%
for so help me God so why they why the
 
04:42:57.230 --> 04:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
once into the woods onto the one hand
 
04:42:59.390 --> 04:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
and out of the woods on the other hand
 
04:43:03.830 --> 04:43:03.840 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question so the the
 
04:43:06.910 --> 04:43:06.920 align:start position:0%
first two are the
 
04:43:10.590 --> 04:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
default where I'm striking it in on line
 
04:43:14.310 --> 04:43:14.320 align:start position:0%
six to seven and and 10 to 11 I'm
 
04:43:17.310 --> 04:43:17.320 align:start position:0%
striking out that is what is normally
 
04:43:18.510 --> 04:43:18.520 align:start position:0%
given if you
 
04:43:18.520 --> 04:43:20.270 align:start position:0%
given if you
don't

04:43:20.270 --> 04:43:20.280 align:start position:0%
don't
 
04:43:23.150 --> 04:43:23.160 align:start position:0%
refuse um that's what is given to
 
04:43:26.708 --> 04:43:26.718 align:start position:0%
everyone right and if you
 
04:43:26.718 --> 04:43:28.230 align:start position:0%
everyone right and if you
refuse

04:43:28.230 --> 04:43:28.240 align:start position:0%
refuse
 
04:43:32.788 --> 04:43:32.798 align:start position:0%
um then comes in this this
 
04:43:37.270 --> 04:43:37.280 align:start position:0%
second part of the the of the uh oath
 
04:43:39.070 --> 04:43:39.080 align:start position:0%
which says
 
04:43:42.550 --> 04:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
um that if anyone is scrupulous of
 
04:43:45.030 --> 04:43:45.040 align:start position:0%
swearing shall decline from taking the
 
04:43:48.110 --> 04:43:48.120 align:start position:0%
said oath and then they admit the words
 
04:43:50.230 --> 04:43:50.240 align:start position:0%
that you have an issue with and
 
04:43:53.590 --> 04:43:53.600 align:start position:0%
substitute the other words and so if you
 
04:43:55.788 --> 04:43:55.798 align:start position:0%
have a issue with I swear under penalty
 
04:44:00.150 --> 04:44:00.160 align:start position:0%
of perjury you can then switch to just
 
04:44:01.830 --> 04:44:01.840 align:start position:0%
eliminate the word swear for certain
 
04:44:05.868 --> 04:44:05.878 align:start position:0%
denominations and and and uh switch to
 
04:44:07.948 --> 04:44:07.958 align:start position:0%
uh so help me God instead of the
 
04:44:11.628 --> 04:44:11.638 align:start position:0%
standard okay thank you absolutely B VI
 
04:44:13.910 --> 04:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
Kella are you aware that this
 
04:44:15.948 --> 04:44:15.958 align:start position:0%
constitutional change would not apply to
 
04:44:15.958 --> 04:44:17.030 align:start position:0%
constitutional change would not apply to
town

04:44:17.030 --> 04:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
town
 
04:44:20.590 --> 04:44:20.600 align:start position:0%
offices if you look on line three town
 
04:44:23.270 --> 04:44:23.280 align:start position:0%
officers are explicitly Exempted from
 
04:44:23.280 --> 04:44:28.190 align:start position:0%
officers are explicitly Exempted from
the

04:44:28.190 --> 04:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:32.750 --> 04:44:32.760 align:start position:0%
oath thank you for the question I do see
 
04:44:37.430 --> 04:44:37.440 align:start position:0%
that it and and
 
04:44:39.708 --> 04:44:39.718 align:start position:0%
so um
 
04:44:43.110 --> 04:44:43.120 align:start position:0%
that's I guess that wouldn't mean that a
 
04:44:46.070 --> 04:44:46.080 align:start position:0%
a change for Town off officers would not
 
04:44:47.948 --> 04:44:47.958 align:start position:0%
require a constitutional amendment and
 
04:44:51.510 --> 04:44:51.520 align:start position:0%
so I I don't think it should be combined
 
04:44:54.310 --> 04:44:54.320 align:start position:0%
with this bill um since it has a this
 
04:44:57.670 --> 04:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
bill has a higher standard to get passed
 
04:45:00.270 --> 04:45:00.280 align:start position:0%
great okay thank you for that thank you
 
04:45:00.280 --> 04:45:01.830 align:start position:0%
great okay thank you for that thank you

04:45:04.670 --> 04:45:04.680 align:start position:0%
dlan thank you madam chair I'm just
 
04:45:06.830 --> 04:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
pulled out a $10 bill out of my wallet
 
04:45:09.350 --> 04:45:09.360 align:start position:0%
and and I'm looking at the top at the
 
04:45:12.628 --> 04:45:12.638 align:start position:0%
back of the bill and the right above the
 
04:45:16.190 --> 04:45:16.200 align:start position:0%
flag it says In God We Trust do do you
 
04:45:17.788 --> 04:45:17.798 align:start position:0%
believe that this change is going to put
 
04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
us at odds with things such as our our
 
04:45:23.350 --> 04:45:23.360 align:start position:0%
currency that we use repes
 
04:45:23.360 --> 04:45:24.550 align:start position:0%
currency that we use repes
representative

04:45:24.550 --> 04:45:24.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:45:27.310 --> 04:45:27.320 align:start position:0%
Dolan I you shouldn't question his
 
04:45:29.110 --> 04:45:29.120 align:start position:0%
motives that
 
04:45:32.670 --> 04:45:32.680 align:start position:0%
way I didn't
 
04:45:40.190 --> 04:45:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:42.150 --> 04:45:42.160 align:start position:0%
I agree that it's a federal that that
 
04:45:44.510 --> 04:45:44.520 align:start position:0%
the the money is a federal issue and not
 
04:45:46.990 --> 04:45:47.000 align:start position:0%
a state issue at this
 
04:45:50.990 --> 04:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
time thank you anyone
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
else okay thank you for your testimony
 
04:45:56.110 --> 04:45:56.120 align:start position:0%
thank you is there anyone else who
 
04:45:59.990 --> 04:46:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:03.190 --> 04:46:03.200 align:start position:0%
ca21 seeing none I'll close the public
 
04:46:03.200 --> 04:46:04.750 align:start position:0%
ca21 seeing none I'll close the public
hearing

04:46:04.750 --> 04:46:04.760 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
04:46:08.110 --> 04:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
and we will resume our executive session
 
04:46:12.030 --> 04:46:12.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
11 and as I represent Simon I think you
 
04:46:16.708 --> 04:46:16.718 align:start position:0%
are on
 
04:46:18.910 --> 04:46:18.920 align:start position:0%
day oh
 
04:46:21.310 --> 04:46:21.320 align:start position:0%
yes you got a backtrack in my thinking
 
04:46:23.590 --> 04:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
to where we were at
 
04:46:26.590 --> 04:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure actually U I was going
 
04:46:28.590 --> 04:46:28.600 align:start position:0%
to respond to representative G's comment
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
that we could um put a hard line in
 
04:46:36.230 --> 04:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
um I mean technically if we were to
 
04:46:39.628 --> 04:46:39.638 align:start position:0%
change the um the term limits on these
 
04:46:41.868 --> 04:46:41.878 align:start position:0%
positions which aren't just in this bill
 
04:46:43.868 --> 04:46:43.878 align:start position:0%
I believe it's it's not just pertaining
 
04:46:45.750 --> 04:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
to sheriffs it would also be pertaining
 
04:46:48.350 --> 04:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
to judges um because judges are included
 
04:46:51.430 --> 04:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
if I'm in this part of the Constitution
 
04:46:53.390 --> 04:46:53.400 align:start position:0%
or so any judge of court judge of
 
04:46:55.150 --> 04:46:55.160 align:start position:0%
probate or Sheriff of any County after
 
04:46:57.590 --> 04:46:57.600 align:start position:0%
the person has attained the age of 70 oh
 
04:47:00.310 --> 04:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
no it switches to sheriff right yep it's
 
04:47:02.990 --> 04:47:03.000 align:start position:0%
the this is specific to Sheriff's okay
 
04:47:04.670 --> 04:47:04.680 align:start position:0%
never mind on that point um but it
 
04:47:06.350 --> 04:47:06.360 align:start position:0%
wouldn't I mean we could set a we could
 
04:47:08.948 --> 04:47:08.958 align:start position:0%
set our the age obviously by the term
 
04:47:11.470 --> 04:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
that we give to the sheriff um but then
 
04:47:14.830 --> 04:47:14.840 align:start position:0%
a subsequent um subsequent legislature
 
04:47:16.430 --> 04:47:16.440 align:start position:0%
could switch that age to another age so
 
04:47:18.750 --> 04:47:18.760 align:start position:0%
it doesn't create a hard line um at any
 
04:47:19.868 --> 04:47:19.878 align:start position:0%
particular point in time I'm not saying
 
04:47:22.590 --> 04:47:22.600 align:start position:0%
that the a future legislature would um
 
04:47:26.070 --> 04:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
be irresponsible or you know um anything
 
04:47:27.788 --> 04:47:27.798 align:start position:0%
of that nature I'm not going to question
 
04:47:29.390 --> 04:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
future people's motives that way or
 
04:47:31.670 --> 04:47:31.680 align:start position:0%
abilities but um just wanted to say I'm
 
04:47:32.910 --> 04:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
not sure that it actually does create a
 
04:47:35.070 --> 04:47:35.080 align:start position:0%
Hardline with obviously maintains
 
04:47:38.910 --> 04:47:38.920 align:start position:0%
control through the legislature but
 
04:47:41.190 --> 04:47:41.200 align:start position:0%
um yeah that was
 
04:47:46.110 --> 04:47:46.120 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:49.548 --> 04:47:49.558 align:start position:0%
comment I decided not to I was I was
 
04:47:51.868 --> 04:47:51.878 align:start position:0%
going to say speaking as an
 
04:47:55.628 --> 04:47:55.638 align:start position:0%
octogenarian uh 70 doesn't seem that
 
04:47:55.638 --> 04:47:58.830 align:start position:0%
octogenarian uh 70 doesn't seem that
whole

04:47:58.830 --> 04:47:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:02.590 --> 04:48:02.600 align:start position:0%
okay yes representative Bailey and I'm
 
04:48:05.628 --> 04:48:05.638 align:start position:0%
not entirely sure this is gerain but
 
04:48:05.638 --> 04:48:07.310 align:start position:0%
not entirely sure this is gerain but
representative

04:48:07.310 --> 04:48:07.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:48:10.548 --> 04:48:10.558 align:start position:0%
uh Schmidt asked or or said that we
 
04:48:13.230 --> 04:48:13.240 align:start position:0%
would be electing a new sheriff sometime
 
04:48:17.310 --> 04:48:17.320 align:start position:0%
soon who who's we is that a is that a
 
04:48:20.030 --> 04:48:20.040 align:start position:0%
general election or is it stord County
 
04:48:22.190 --> 04:48:22.200 align:start position:0%
delegation you and I then are the ones
 
04:48:24.150 --> 04:48:24.160 align:start position:0%
long Us in the room that will be doing
 
04:48:27.590 --> 04:48:27.600 align:start position:0%
this I'm not sure I'm comfortable with
 
04:48:31.590 --> 04:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
that uh but okay thank you you remember
 
04:48:35.750 --> 04:48:35.760 align:start position:0%
you remember we elected County attorne
 
04:48:43.830 --> 04:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:45.830 --> 04:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
comment yeah thank you madam chair
 
04:48:48.390 --> 04:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
following up on uh representative Shu
 
04:48:51.510 --> 04:48:51.520 align:start position:0%
said something about one year
 
04:48:55.110 --> 04:48:55.120 align:start position:0%
actually you could be 74 years 11 months
 
04:48:57.070 --> 04:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
and 30 days
 
04:49:00.350 --> 04:49:00.360 align:start position:0%
old when you get elected yes that's how
 
04:49:01.868 --> 04:49:01.878 align:start position:0%
long you could be in if you were elected
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
a day before your birthday and rock M
 
04:49:08.310 --> 04:49:08.320 align:start position:0%
what's that just rock and rock yes and
 
04:49:10.430 --> 04:49:10.440 align:start position:0%
that count and and follow up yeah follow
 
04:49:12.430 --> 04:49:12.440 align:start position:0%
up and and a couple people have said
 
04:49:16.030 --> 04:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
this but it it uh um it seems like a a
 
04:49:17.990 --> 04:49:18.000 align:start position:0%
oneoff and when you take the job as
 
04:49:20.270 --> 04:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
Sheriff you know when it ends and if you
 
04:49:22.868 --> 04:49:22.878 align:start position:0%
you haven't finished your your goals and
 
04:49:24.990 --> 04:49:25.000 align:start position:0%
that is kind of how life goes sometimes
 
04:49:25.000 --> 04:49:25.990 align:start position:0%
that is kind of how life goes sometimes
I

04:49:25.990 --> 04:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:49:28.868 --> 04:49:28.878 align:start position:0%
think ran black us thank you yeah for
 
04:49:30.708 --> 04:49:30.718 align:start position:0%
that reason I'm going to and also
 
04:49:33.548 --> 04:49:33.558 align:start position:0%
because uh the this is a limit in the
 
04:49:33.558 --> 04:49:34.548 align:start position:0%
because uh the this is a limit in the
con

04:49:34.548 --> 04:49:34.558 align:start position:0%
con
 
04:49:36.868 --> 04:49:36.878 align:start position:0%
stitution um but it can be gotten around
 
04:49:38.430 --> 04:49:38.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying legisl would do it but we
 
04:49:40.670 --> 04:49:40.680 align:start position:0%
could legislature could set the maximum
 
04:49:42.670 --> 04:49:42.680 align:start position:0%
term to 70 years or something and
 
04:49:45.110 --> 04:49:45.120 align:start position:0%
basically make this thing null and so
 
04:49:48.750 --> 04:49:48.760 align:start position:0%
unless there were a maximum um term
 
04:49:50.430 --> 04:49:50.440 align:start position:0%
they're elected at in this amendment as
 
04:49:53.510 --> 04:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
well I'd have to oppose it okay
 
04:49:55.830 --> 04:49:55.840 align:start position:0%
representative sh thank you madam chair
 
04:49:58.708 --> 04:49:58.718 align:start position:0%
leave us not forget that all this really
 
04:50:02.150 --> 04:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
does is puts it to the voters to see if
 
04:50:05.708 --> 04:50:05.718 align:start position:0%
they want to agree with it or not
 
04:50:08.830 --> 04:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
y okay well I'd like to say that I'm
 
04:50:10.990 --> 04:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable legislating for one
 
04:50:14.628 --> 04:50:14.638 align:start position:0%
person which is what it seems to be and
 
04:50:19.030 --> 04:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:21.868 --> 04:50:21.878 align:start position:0%
amendment all right anyone else comments
 
04:50:24.070 --> 04:50:24.080 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
04:50:27.708 --> 04:50:27.718 align:start position:0%
G I've heard several several of you talk
 
04:50:30.310 --> 04:50:30.320 align:start position:0%
about that it's only for one person but
 
04:50:32.430 --> 04:50:32.440 align:start position:0%
yet representative Schmidt is telling us
 
04:50:35.708 --> 04:50:35.718 align:start position:0%
about a second and it really is about
 
04:50:38.948 --> 04:50:38.958 align:start position:0%
anybody who and and as we've talked
 
04:50:38.958 --> 04:50:41.310 align:start position:0%
anybody who and and as we've talked
about

04:50:41.310 --> 04:50:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:41.320 --> 04:50:43.190 align:start position:0%
 
that

04:50:43.190 --> 04:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:50:46.548 --> 04:50:46.558 align:start position:0%
repres excuse me representative Shu
 
04:50:49.548 --> 04:50:49.558 align:start position:0%
expressed that is generally
 
04:50:53.868 --> 04:50:53.878 align:start position:0%
retirees so um I think that just because
 
04:50:55.670 --> 04:50:55.680 align:start position:0%
one person who came forward and
 
04:50:58.430 --> 04:50:58.440 align:start position:0%
testified is experiencing it we should
 
04:51:00.190 --> 04:51:00.200 align:start position:0%
look at this as something that could
 
04:51:02.990 --> 04:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
affect any candidate and it isn't really
 
04:51:04.310 --> 04:51:04.320 align:start position:0%
only about woman
 
04:51:08.270 --> 04:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
candidate okay thank you thank you any
 
04:51:09.670 --> 04:51:09.680 align:start position:0%

04:55:02.400 --> 04:55:04.910 align:start position:0%

04:56:02.320 --> 05:05:23.590 align:start position:0%
 
right

05:05:23.590 --> 05:05:23.600 align:start position:0%

be here for the first time that I I
 
05:05:57.470 --> 05:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
believe it's my first time here so it's
 
05:05:58.830 --> 05:05:58.840 align:start position:0%
really nice to see everybody and
 
05:06:01.868 --> 05:06:01.878 align:start position:0%
hopefully finish out the day with a bill
 
05:06:04.230 --> 05:06:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's a little lighter than some of the
 
05:06:05.708 --> 05:06:05.718 align:start position:0%
topics that we
 
05:06:08.470 --> 05:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
get um I've been told that this bill is
 
05:06:11.868 --> 05:06:11.878 align:start position:0%
a talker talker over the Thanksgiving
 
05:06:13.948 --> 05:06:13.958 align:start position:0%
table and around Christmas and everybody
 
05:06:16.310 --> 05:06:16.320 align:start position:0%
seems to have an opinion on it which can
 
05:06:17.430 --> 05:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
make it kind of
 
05:06:21.470 --> 05:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
fun so I just want to talk a tiny bit
 
05:06:23.230 --> 05:06:23.240 align:start position:0%
about some of the history Jonathan
 
05:06:25.910 --> 05:06:25.920 align:start position:0%
Robinson Ebenezer Hawkins and David leay
 
05:06:30.070 --> 05:06:30.080 align:start position:0%
wrote to General Stark in the spring of
 
05:06:33.510 --> 05:06:33.520 align:start position:0%
1810 and the letter is here actually uh
 
05:06:34.990 --> 05:06:35.000 align:start position:0%
you can see it on the Historical Society
 
05:06:36.708 --> 05:06:36.718 align:start position:0%
this is the full letter and it's our
 
05:06:39.708 --> 05:06:39.718 align:start position:0%
best known recollection and recording of
 
05:06:42.948 --> 05:06:42.958 align:start position:0%
our actual monitor or motto they said
 
05:06:45.750 --> 05:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
the toast sir which you sent in 1809
 
05:06:47.868 --> 05:06:47.878 align:start position:0%
will continue to vibrate with unending
 
05:06:50.548 --> 05:06:50.558 align:start position:0%
pleasure in our ears Live Free or Die
 
05:06:53.150 --> 05:06:53.160 align:start position:0%
death is not the greatest of
 
05:06:55.590 --> 05:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
evils so these were the famous words
 
05:06:57.750 --> 05:06:57.760 align:start position:0%
penned by penned by General Stark
 
05:06:59.910 --> 05:06:59.920 align:start position:0%
commemorating the Battle of Bennington
 
05:07:01.390 --> 05:07:01.400 align:start position:0%
of course he's known as the hero of
 
05:07:01.400 --> 05:07:02.948 align:start position:0%
of course he's known as the hero of
Bennington

05:07:02.948 --> 05:07:02.958 align:start position:0%
Bennington
 
05:07:04.670 --> 05:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
and they have continued to reverberate
 
05:07:08.230 --> 05:07:08.240 align:start position:0%
across New Hampshire for many many years
 
05:07:11.230 --> 05:07:11.240 align:start position:0%
1945 became it landed on our our state
 
05:07:14.788 --> 05:07:14.798 align:start position:0%
emblem and became our state motto 1969
 
05:07:16.510 --> 05:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
we put it on the license plate and then
 
05:07:20.310 --> 05:07:20.320 align:start position:0%
some 30 years later some
 
05:07:24.990 --> 05:07:25.000 align:start position:0%
young naive 20-some sponsored a house
 
05:07:27.190 --> 05:07:27.200 align:start position:0%
resolution in
 
05:07:30.350 --> 05:07:30.360 align:start position:0%
1999 to put it on the state quarter and
 
05:07:32.470 --> 05:07:32.480 align:start position:0%
that was me that was this legislator
 
05:07:34.948 --> 05:07:34.958 align:start position:0%
with uh then representative
 
05:07:37.910 --> 05:07:37.920 align:start position:0%
lerno Senator Hollingsworth and a few
 
05:07:39.670 --> 05:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
others it was a bipartisan effort to
 
05:07:41.910 --> 05:07:41.920 align:start position:0%
enshrine Live Free or Die Forever on our
 
05:07:44.548 --> 05:07:44.558 align:start position:0%
United States currency representing our
 
05:07:46.750 --> 05:07:46.760 align:start position:0%
state so since then it never really
 
05:07:48.708 --> 05:07:48.718 align:start position:0%
occurred to me to put it on the
 
05:07:51.510 --> 05:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
flag until I went to
 
05:07:54.390 --> 05:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
ncsl last year and I thought well I've
 
05:07:56.030 --> 05:07:56.040 align:start position:0%
been gone a long time as a returning
 
05:07:57.788 --> 05:07:57.798 align:start position:0%
member there's an awful lot of members
 
05:08:00.830 --> 05:08:00.840 align:start position:0%
here that I don't know you see at at
 
05:08:03.030 --> 05:08:03.040 align:start position:0%
ncsl you get one of the those big fancy
 
05:08:05.110 --> 05:08:05.120 align:start position:0%
credentials and they not only put your
 
05:08:07.830 --> 05:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
name and somewhere they put your state
 
05:08:10.030 --> 05:08:10.040 align:start position:0%
but they put a little tiny version of
 
05:08:13.548 --> 05:08:13.558 align:start position:0%
your state flag so if you take a look at
 
05:08:16.110 --> 05:08:16.120 align:start position:0%
the second page the committee Services
 
05:08:18.070 --> 05:08:18.080 align:start position:0%
was kind enough to make some color
 
05:08:21.910 --> 05:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
copies for me you can see all the
 
05:08:24.510 --> 05:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
different flags in the that's in this
 
05:08:27.868 --> 05:08:27.878 align:start position:0%
chart um that has the red you know the
 
05:08:30.190 --> 05:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
the beautiful great good boring these
 
05:08:32.230 --> 05:08:32.240 align:start position:0%
that ratings down towards the bottom you
 
05:08:34.750 --> 05:08:34.760 align:start position:0%
see all the ones that are considered
 
05:08:37.270 --> 05:08:37.280 align:start position:0%
boring and they are affectionately
 
05:08:39.830 --> 05:08:39.840 align:start position:0%
referred to as blue bed sheets with a
 
05:08:42.310 --> 05:08:42.320 align:start position:0%
state seal and I didn't come up with
 
05:08:45.750 --> 05:08:45.760 align:start position:0%
that so you know we're a great state
 
05:08:47.430 --> 05:08:47.440 align:start position:0%
without a great flag I mean we're
 
05:08:50.390 --> 05:08:50.400 align:start position:0%
incredibly unique in so many ways and
 
05:08:52.910 --> 05:08:52.920 align:start position:0%
everybody knows Live Free or Die across
 
05:08:54.110 --> 05:08:54.120 align:start position:0%
the country I mean I can't get on an
 
05:08:55.948 --> 05:08:55.958 align:start position:0%
airplane go to another city and tell
 
05:08:57.350 --> 05:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
them I'm from New Hampshire without
 
05:08:59.190 --> 05:08:59.200 align:start position:0%
saying without having someone say oh the
 
05:09:00.750 --> 05:09:00.760 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die
 
05:09:03.390 --> 05:09:03.400 align:start position:0%
State people like to be like us but they
 
05:09:06.070 --> 05:09:06.080 align:start position:0%
can't recognize our flag so I looked
 
05:09:08.510 --> 05:09:08.520 align:start position:0%
into how many other times this has been
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
tried and the most recent time was House
 
05:09:13.868 --> 05:09:13.878 align:start position:0%
Bill 123 sponsored by our own house
 
05:09:15.868 --> 05:09:15.878 align:start position:0%
clerk then representative Paul
 
05:09:19.270 --> 05:09:19.280 align:start position:0%
Smith also with one of my co-sponsors
 
05:09:22.390 --> 05:09:22.400 align:start position:0%
then Senator lerno and their idea was to
 
05:09:26.230 --> 05:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
put Old English script in some scroll
 
05:09:28.390 --> 05:09:28.400 align:start position:0%
work and it was rather
 
05:09:31.430 --> 05:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
complex and it arguably was difficult to
 
05:09:34.390 --> 05:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
read as this this could be also actually
 
05:09:37.230 --> 05:09:37.240 align:start position:0%
so um that went to a floor fight and
 
05:09:39.190 --> 05:09:39.200 align:start position:0%
narrowly failed actually it wasn't uh
 
05:09:41.390 --> 05:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
that was about I want to say it was
 
05:09:44.230 --> 05:09:44.240 align:start position:0%
2017 something like that so it's been
 
05:09:46.070 --> 05:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
tried a few times before there's been
 
05:09:49.548 --> 05:09:49.558 align:start position:0%
bills to radically redesign everything
 
05:09:51.548 --> 05:09:51.558 align:start position:0%
um you know have a contest the conquered
 
05:09:53.788 --> 05:09:53.798 align:start position:0%
monitor had wrote an article about
 
05:09:55.110 --> 05:09:55.120 align:start position:0%
having high school design students
 
05:09:56.510 --> 05:09:56.520 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of discussion about
 
05:09:58.150 --> 05:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
this over the years so why now and why
 
05:10:01.350 --> 05:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
should we do this well first of all um
 
05:10:03.350 --> 05:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
about six eight other states have
 
05:10:05.590 --> 05:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
already done something similar they've
 
05:10:08.110 --> 05:10:08.120 align:start position:0%
done more dramatic redesigns Maine is in
 
05:10:09.788 --> 05:10:09.798 align:start position:0%
the final stages of
 
05:10:12.230 --> 05:10:12.240 align:start position:0%
adoption um so why don't we just have a
 
05:10:14.830 --> 05:10:14.840 align:start position:0%
whole redesign have a newspaper contest
 
05:10:17.150 --> 05:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
have a commissioner committee well all
 
05:10:19.868 --> 05:10:19.878 align:start position:0%
of those things kind of make me chuckle
 
05:10:22.750 --> 05:10:22.760 align:start position:0%
that's an awful lot of cooks and could
 
05:10:25.990 --> 05:10:26.000 align:start position:0%
be a difficult pill for the
 
05:10:28.628 --> 05:10:28.638 align:start position:0%
traditionalists to accept taking the
 
05:10:30.350 --> 05:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
Raleigh off the flag I mean there's a
 
05:10:32.910 --> 05:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
lot of history in our state seal
 
05:10:35.390 --> 05:10:35.400 align:start position:0%
but I will tell you that Having learned
 
05:10:39.150 --> 05:10:39.160 align:start position:0%
about the basic rules of flag design our
 
05:10:41.548 --> 05:10:41.558 align:start position:0%
flag well first of all rule number one
 
05:10:44.110 --> 05:10:44.120 align:start position:0%
is you will never please anyone right
 
05:10:47.310 --> 05:10:47.320 align:start position:0%
universally you just will not some of
 
05:10:48.670 --> 05:10:48.680 align:start position:0%
the other rules are things like don't
 
05:10:50.670 --> 05:10:50.680 align:start position:0%
put a state seal on a flag some other
 
05:10:53.708 --> 05:10:53.718 align:start position:0%
ones are don't put any text on a flag so
 
05:10:57.070 --> 05:10:57.080 align:start position:0%
yes I'm suggesting our flag violate one
 
05:11:01.070 --> 05:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
more rule by putting text on it but it
 
05:11:04.270 --> 05:11:04.280 align:start position:0%
is such unique text Live Free or Die
 
05:11:07.110 --> 05:11:07.120 align:start position:0%
death is not the greatest of evils we
 
05:11:08.910 --> 05:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
hear it as death is not the worst of
 
05:11:10.270 --> 05:11:10.280 align:start position:0%
evils there are worse evils than death
 
05:11:11.990 --> 05:11:12.000 align:start position:0%
but I assure you the most historically
 
05:11:14.628 --> 05:11:14.638 align:start position:0%
accurate is death is not the greatest of
 
05:11:18.070 --> 05:11:18.080 align:start position:0%
evils so the first part live for or die
 
05:11:20.270 --> 05:11:20.280 align:start position:0%
I just believe in my core belongs on our
 
05:11:23.788 --> 05:11:23.798 align:start position:0%
flag so we don't get confused with all
 
05:11:26.110 --> 05:11:26.120 align:start position:0%
the other blue bed sheets so how do we
 
05:11:28.708 --> 05:11:28.718 align:start position:0%
do it well it's pretty simple um we roll
 
05:11:31.150 --> 05:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
it out over five years so that we use up
 
05:11:33.868 --> 05:11:33.878 align:start position:0%
our stock of exist Flags any flag
 
05:11:35.910 --> 05:11:35.920 align:start position:0%
manufacturer like Anon or any of the
 
05:11:38.708 --> 05:11:38.718 align:start position:0%
other big ones Anon is the big boy uh
 
05:11:42.070 --> 05:11:42.080 align:start position:0%
will happily prepare a flag for us at no
 
05:11:43.670 --> 05:11:43.680 align:start position:0%
cost you know they won't charge us like
 
05:11:45.270 --> 05:11:45.280 align:start position:0%
a setup fee or something like that if
 
05:11:46.390 --> 05:11:46.400 align:start position:0%
they did it'd be 100 hundred bucks but
 
05:11:48.030 --> 05:11:48.040 align:start position:0%
they won't do it anyways because they're
 
05:11:50.430 --> 05:11:50.440 align:start position:0%
going to sell plenty of Flags uh when we
 
05:11:51.788 --> 05:11:51.798 align:start position:0%
add Live Free or Die to it so it's
 
05:11:53.070 --> 05:11:53.080 align:start position:0%
pretty much that simple I've given you
 
05:11:54.510 --> 05:11:54.520 align:start position:0%
my written testimony there's a few other
 
05:11:57.110 --> 05:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
historical tidbits in there like how we
 
05:12:00.230 --> 05:12:00.240 align:start position:0%
ranked 63rd out of 71 flags of North
 
05:12:02.150 --> 05:12:02.160 align:start position:0%
American states and territories that
 
05:12:03.590 --> 05:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
included some from Canada they've got
 
05:12:05.470 --> 05:12:05.480 align:start position:0%
some boring flags up there too so we
 
05:12:08.548 --> 05:12:08.558 align:start position:0%
were 63rd out of 71 which is pretty bad
 
05:12:10.948 --> 05:12:10.958 align:start position:0%
um but there's at least 20 States whose
 
05:12:13.190 --> 05:12:13.200 align:start position:0%
flags look just like ours and you know
 
05:12:16.070 --> 05:12:16.080 align:start position:0%
what that's long enough it's long enough
 
05:12:17.670 --> 05:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
it has been our flag for over a hundred
 
05:12:19.990 --> 05:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
years and this time we add Live Free or
 
05:12:21.590 --> 05:12:21.600 align:start position:0%
Die to
 
05:12:24.110 --> 05:12:24.120 align:start position:0%
it all right thank you for your
 
05:12:26.510 --> 05:12:26.520 align:start position:0%
testimony I'd like to mention that your
 
05:12:28.628 --> 05:12:28.638 align:start position:0%
proposed redesign would not take us out
 
05:12:32.628 --> 05:12:32.638 align:start position:0%
of the boring category because Montana
 
05:12:36.590 --> 05:12:36.600 align:start position:0%
and Kansas already haveing to say which
 
05:12:38.910 --> 05:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
which state they're in on their blue bed
 
05:12:41.470 --> 05:12:41.480 align:start position:0%
sheets so are there any questions from
 
05:12:44.310 --> 05:12:44.320 align:start position:0%
the committee slightly less boring
 
05:12:47.150 --> 05:12:47.160 align:start position:0%
maybe and somewhat more
 
05:12:49.750 --> 05:12:49.760 align:start position:0%
recognizable but yes you are correct we
 
05:12:51.910 --> 05:12:51.920 align:start position:0%
would actually violate one additional
 
05:12:55.070 --> 05:12:55.080 align:start position:0%
rule of flag design and I will also
 
05:12:56.470 --> 05:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
mention I think I said in my written
 
05:13:00.030 --> 05:13:00.040 align:start position:0%
testimony um I've been uh regaled with
 
05:13:03.150 --> 05:13:03.160 align:start position:0%
literally hundreds of design suggestions
 
05:13:05.190 --> 05:13:05.200 align:start position:0%
for complete redesign one of which is
 
05:13:07.830 --> 05:13:07.840 align:start position:0%
sitting behind me a lovely gentleman
 
05:13:09.390 --> 05:13:09.400 align:start position:0%
who's 12 years old and I will let him
 
05:13:11.070 --> 05:13:11.080 align:start position:0%
speak for himself because he is more
 
05:13:11.080 --> 05:13:11.910 align:start position:0%
speak for himself because he is more
than

05:13:11.910 --> 05:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
than
 
05:13:14.110 --> 05:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
capable um but there have been an awful
 
05:13:15.310 --> 05:13:15.320 align:start position:0%
lot of suggestions for complete
 
05:13:17.788 --> 05:13:17.798 align:start position:0%
redesigns and personally I think that's
 
05:13:19.548 --> 05:13:19.558 align:start position:0%
a great idea as long as it includes Live
 
05:13:23.788 --> 05:13:23.798 align:start position:0%
Free or Die but my legislative
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
experience tells me that there may not
 
05:13:27.030 --> 05:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
be the political will for such a radical
 
05:13:30.230 --> 05:13:30.240 align:start position:0%
departure from tradition so baby steps
 
05:13:32.590 --> 05:13:32.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't anticipate asking to fully
 
05:13:35.190 --> 05:13:35.200 align:start position:0%
redesign it five years from now if you
 
05:13:39.390 --> 05:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
do this thank you anyone else have a
 
05:13:42.788 --> 05:13:42.798 align:start position:0%
question all right seeing none
 
05:13:42.798 --> 05:14:00.670 align:start position:0%
question all right seeing none
representative

05:14:00.670 --> 05:14:00.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:03.548 --> 05:14:03.558 align:start position:0%
Corman thank you madam chair I'm Tom
 
05:14:06.190 --> 05:14:06.200 align:start position:0%
Corman I represent Grafton 15 which is
 
05:14:09.948 --> 05:14:09.958 align:start position:0%
Ward three of the city of Lebanon and I
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
agree with representative MCU that our
 
05:14:16.948 --> 05:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
flag could use Improvement um and it's
 
05:14:19.190 --> 05:14:19.200 align:start position:0%
true it's a lot like a lot of the other
 
05:14:22.070 --> 05:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
flags there's a very entertaining video
 
05:14:25.110 --> 05:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
that you can find where uh the flags are
 
05:14:27.548 --> 05:14:27.558 align:start position:0%
actually put into various categories a
 
05:14:31.150 --> 05:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
through F minus ours is I think F minus
 
05:14:33.190 --> 05:14:33.200 align:start position:0%
or maybe just F but it's it's down in
 
05:14:35.310 --> 05:14:35.320 align:start position:0%
the bottom
 
05:14:37.990 --> 05:14:38.000 align:start position:0%
tier I actually was thinking of
 
05:14:41.390 --> 05:14:41.400 align:start position:0%
submitting a bill on the state flag this
 
05:14:43.590 --> 05:14:43.600 align:start position:0%
year uh in consultation with
 
05:14:45.830 --> 05:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
representative MCU I decided to wait a
 
05:14:48.670 --> 05:14:48.680 align:start position:0%
year and and let his bill process
 
05:14:51.830 --> 05:14:51.840 align:start position:0%
through the bill that I would uh have
 
05:14:53.750 --> 05:14:53.760 align:start position:0%
presented would have been about a study
 
05:14:55.788 --> 05:14:55.798 align:start position:0%
commission about the flag that would
 
05:14:58.310 --> 05:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
have included somebody from the state
 
05:15:01.110 --> 05:15:01.120 align:start position:0%
his historical society and somebody from
 
05:15:03.150 --> 05:15:03.160 align:start position:0%
the new England vexillological
 
05:15:04.948 --> 05:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
Association for those who don't know
 
05:15:08.548 --> 05:15:08.558 align:start position:0%
vexillology is the study of flags and in
 
05:15:12.708 --> 05:15:12.718 align:start position:0%
fact I have here good flag bad flag a
 
05:15:14.628 --> 05:15:14.638 align:start position:0%
guide to flag design or how to design a
 
05:15:16.708 --> 05:15:16.718 align:start position:0%
great flag put out by the North American
 
05:15:18.430 --> 05:15:18.440 align:start position:0%
Vex olical
 
05:15:20.708 --> 05:15:20.718 align:start position:0%
society and they have the principles of
 
05:15:23.750 --> 05:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
flag design number one keep it simple
 
05:15:25.628 --> 05:15:25.638 align:start position:0%
the flag should be so simple that a
 
05:15:28.830 --> 05:15:28.840 align:start position:0%
child can draw it from memory so a great
 
05:15:32.310 --> 05:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
example would be say Texas a star
 
05:15:36.270 --> 05:15:36.280 align:start position:0%
in a blue background couple of
 
05:15:39.390 --> 05:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
Stripes use meaningful
 
05:15:41.350 --> 05:15:41.360 align:start position:0%
symbolism uh so of course we have the
 
05:15:43.670 --> 05:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
Raleigh which is actually in the state
 
05:15:47.270 --> 05:15:47.280 align:start position:0%
seal and um I would posit that if you
 
05:15:49.910 --> 05:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
were to randomly ask a thousand New
 
05:15:52.350 --> 05:15:52.360 align:start position:0%
Hampshire residents tell me something
 
05:15:56.788 --> 05:15:56.798 align:start position:0%
about the boat on the flag I doubt more
 
05:15:58.990 --> 05:15:59.000 align:start position:0%
than 10% could tell you anything about
 
05:16:02.430 --> 05:16:02.440 align:start position:0%
the boat on the flag including its name
 
05:16:05.070 --> 05:16:05.080 align:start position:0%
number three use two or three basic
 
05:16:07.030 --> 05:16:07.040 align:start position:0%
colors well our flag has a lot of
 
05:16:11.430 --> 05:16:11.440 align:start position:0%
different colors on it number four no
 
05:16:14.430 --> 05:16:14.440 align:start position:0%
lettering or Seals All right we fail on
 
05:16:15.830 --> 05:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
that not only do we have the seal but
 
05:16:18.190 --> 05:16:18.200 align:start position:0%
the seal has lettering that says seal of
 
05:16:20.310 --> 05:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
the State of New Hampshire and then of
 
05:16:22.350 --> 05:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
course this proposal is to add more text
 
05:16:25.030 --> 05:16:25.040 align:start position:0%
which representative MCU admits it it
 
05:16:28.150 --> 05:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
violates that rule uh one of the things
 
05:16:31.670 --> 05:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
about text is it is hard to read even
 
05:16:34.070 --> 05:16:34.080 align:start position:0%
text the that that representative muu
 
05:16:36.670 --> 05:16:36.680 align:start position:0%
has proposed with specific size and a
 
05:16:39.708 --> 05:16:39.718 align:start position:0%
specific font it can be hard to read and
 
05:16:43.390 --> 05:16:43.400 align:start position:0%
also on the reverse side of a flag it
 
05:16:45.270 --> 05:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
would just be Mirror Image unless the
 
05:16:49.190 --> 05:16:49.200 align:start position:0%
flag is somehow uh printed on both sides
 
05:16:52.350 --> 05:16:52.360 align:start position:0%
and number five be distinctive or be
 
05:16:54.670 --> 05:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
related avoid duplicating other flags
 
05:16:57.270 --> 05:16:57.280 align:start position:0%
but use similarities to show connections
 
05:16:59.548 --> 05:16:59.558 align:start position:0%
so of course we are just like these
 
05:17:02.110 --> 05:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
other flags it certainly isn't unique
 
05:17:04.470 --> 05:17:04.480 align:start position:0%
so I I just feel like if we take our
 
05:17:07.070 --> 05:17:07.080 align:start position:0%
current flag and add text to it we're
 
05:17:11.628 --> 05:17:11.638 align:start position:0%
taking a I hate to say but a bad flag
 
05:17:16.030 --> 05:17:16.040 align:start position:0%
and we're making it worse so I'll
 
05:17:17.310 --> 05:17:17.320 align:start position:0%
conclude with
 
05:17:19.430 --> 05:17:19.440 align:start position:0%
that thank you for the for your
 
05:17:21.230 --> 05:17:21.240 align:start position:0%

could send the uh information from that
 
05:17:29.830 --> 05:17:29.840 align:start position:0%
that you had there on uh flag design and
 
05:17:32.830 --> 05:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
just send a link to it to the committee

05:18:22.670 --> 05:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madame chair and members
 
05:18:23.628 --> 05:18:23.638 align:start position:0%
of the
 
05:18:25.990 --> 05:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
committee I am Andrew flockton of
 
05:18:28.750 --> 05:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
Milford and a member of the North
 
05:18:31.628 --> 05:18:31.638 align:start position:0%
American vexillological Association
 
05:18:34.910 --> 05:18:34.920 align:start position:0%
which studies Flags I am testifying in
 
05:18:38.310 --> 05:18:38.320 align:start position:0%
support of house bail 1016 specifically
 
05:18:40.708 --> 05:18:40.718 align:start position:0%
an amendment by representative Dunn
 
05:18:42.670 --> 05:18:42.680 align:start position:0%
proposing my design for the state flag
 
05:18:44.350 --> 05:18:44.360 align:start position:0%
of New
 
05:18:48.990 --> 05:18:49.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I thank representative MCU for
 
05:18:49.000 --> 05:18:50.390 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I thank representative MCU for
his

05:18:50.390 --> 05:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
his
 
05:18:53.310 --> 05:18:53.320 align:start position:0%
testimony and I think that the current
 
05:18:55.830 --> 05:18:55.840 align:start position:0%
state flag of New Hampshire basically
 
05:18:58.788 --> 05:18:58.798 align:start position:0%
consists of the state seal on a blue
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
background commonly called a seal on a
 
05:19:03.948 --> 05:19:03.958 align:start position:0%
bed sheet the people of New Hampshire
 
05:19:05.948 --> 05:19:05.958 align:start position:0%
helped me decide what to put on this
 
05:19:08.628 --> 05:19:08.638 align:start position:0%
flag this speech will tell you why these
 
05:19:11.310 --> 05:19:11.320 align:start position:0%
symbols are on my flag and why I think
 
05:19:14.590 --> 05:19:14.600 align:start position:0%
the state flag should be changed firstly
 
05:19:16.070 --> 05:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
The Old Man of the Mountain is a
 
05:19:18.470 --> 05:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
distinct symbol to both new hampshirites
 
05:19:20.030 --> 05:19:20.040 align:start position:0%
and people
 
05:19:22.470 --> 05:19:22.480 align:start position:0%
Nationwide The Old Man of the Mountain
 
05:19:25.030 --> 05:19:25.040 align:start position:0%
is synonymous with New Hampshire it is
 
05:19:27.750 --> 05:19:27.760 align:start position:0%
on the state emblem license plates State
 
05:19:30.230 --> 05:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
Route signs and the New Hampshire State
 
05:19:30.240 --> 05:19:32.830 align:start position:0%
Route signs and the New Hampshire State
quarter

05:19:32.830 --> 05:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
quarter
 
05:19:34.830 --> 05:19:34.840 align:start position:0%
The Motto Live Free or Die is a
 
05:19:37.270 --> 05:19:37.280 align:start position:0%
synonymous symbol featured on our state
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
emblem and license plates this flag
 
05:19:42.548 --> 05:19:42.558 align:start position:0%
would give the old man representation on
 
05:19:45.670 --> 05:19:45.680 align:start position:0%
flag polls across the state this flag
 
05:19:48.230 --> 05:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
also includes Live Free or Die our state
 
05:19:51.430 --> 05:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
motto famously ran by General John Stark
 
05:19:51.440 --> 05:19:52.430 align:start position:0%
motto famously ran by General John Stark
in

05:19:52.430 --> 05:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:19:55.070 --> 05:19:55.080 align:start position:0%
1809 there are also Nine Stars
 
05:19:56.750 --> 05:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
representing New Hampshire being the
 
05:19:58.670 --> 05:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
ninth state admitted to the
 
05:20:02.110 --> 05:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
union secondly two states have recently
 
05:20:04.868 --> 05:20:04.878 align:start position:0%
changed their seal on a bed sheet Flags
 
05:20:07.628 --> 05:20:07.638 align:start position:0%
Utah and
 
05:20:11.230 --> 05:20:11.240 align:start position:0%
Minnesota I think that the design I'm
 
05:20:13.030 --> 05:20:13.040 align:start position:0%
proposing would be a unique symbol of
 
05:20:15.708 --> 05:20:15.718 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire the New Hampshire flag is
 
05:20:18.070 --> 05:20:18.080 align:start position:0%
one of 33 that Ed their state seal or
 
05:20:20.670 --> 05:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
coat of arms on their flag and one of
 
05:20:23.310 --> 05:20:23.320 align:start position:0%
the 25 flags with a blue
 
05:20:26.470 --> 05:20:26.480 align:start position:0%
background in the 2001 State and
 
05:20:29.070 --> 05:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
provincial flag survey by the North
 
05:20:31.788 --> 05:20:31.798 align:start position:0%
American vexillological Association a
 
05:20:34.628 --> 05:20:34.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire rank 63rd or in other
 
05:20:37.510 --> 05:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
words the 10th worst flag in the
 
05:20:40.670 --> 05:20:40.680 align:start position:0%
survey that is why I argue that if New
 
05:20:42.990 --> 05:20:43.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's flag has changed it may be a
 
05:20:44.948 --> 05:20:44.958 align:start position:0%
better and more effective flag to
 
05:20:47.590 --> 05:20:47.600 align:start position:0%
represent New Hampshire I have spoken
 
05:20:51.350 --> 05:20:51.360 align:start position:0%
with flag experts and shown them my
 
05:20:54.548 --> 05:20:54.558 align:start position:0%
design they seem to like the Old Man of
 
05:20:54.558 --> 05:20:55.470 align:start position:0%
design they seem to like the Old Man of
the

05:20:55.470 --> 05:20:55.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:20:58.788 --> 05:20:58.798 align:start position:0%
Mountain a simple design with FL with
 
05:21:02.548 --> 05:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
few colors and no state seal the state
 
05:21:05.470 --> 05:21:05.480 align:start position:0%
seal is disliked by both vexillologists
 
05:21:07.230 --> 05:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
and New Hampshire
 
05:21:11.430 --> 05:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:13.310 --> 05:21:13.320 align:start position:0%
vexillologists the
 
05:21:15.830 --> 05:21:15.840 align:start position:0%
people the vexillologists would like a
 
05:21:15.840 --> 05:21:16.948 align:start position:0%
people the vexillologists would like a
simple

05:21:16.948 --> 05:21:16.958 align:start position:0%
simple
 
05:21:20.030 --> 05:21:20.040 align:start position:0%
flag although none of the vists are from
 
05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire they were swayed when I
 
05:21:25.230 --> 05:21:25.240 align:start position:0%
educated them on the symbolism of the
 
05:21:28.990 --> 05:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
old man and Live Free or Die the people
 
05:21:31.150 --> 05:21:31.160 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire that I've talked to
 
05:21:33.350 --> 05:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
like the flag that incorporates The Old
 
05:21:36.310 --> 05:21:36.320 align:start position:0%
Man and live for your die you can see
 
05:21:37.230 --> 05:21:37.240 align:start position:0%
both the
 
05:21:40.270 --> 05:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
vexillologists and the People's Choice
 
05:21:42.948 --> 05:21:42.958 align:start position:0%
on a slideshow I have submitted to this
 
05:21:45.708 --> 05:21:45.718 align:start position:0%
committee you may wonder how many people
 
05:21:48.190 --> 05:21:48.200 align:start position:0%
visit the beautiful White Mountains in
 
05:21:51.030 --> 05:21:51.040 align:start position:0%
which the old man was nestled well
 
05:21:53.310 --> 05:21:53.320 align:start position:0%
according to the forest service the
 
05:21:55.310 --> 05:21:55.320 align:start position:0%
White Mountains receives upwards of six
 
05:21:57.868 --> 05:21:57.878 align:start position:0%
million visitors annually there is a
 
05:21:59.830 --> 05:21:59.840 align:start position:0%
field of white on my flag to represent
 
05:22:01.670 --> 05:22:01.680 align:start position:0%
the White Mountains
 
05:22:04.670 --> 05:22:04.680 align:start position:0%
a large majority of these vors visitors
 
05:22:06.628 --> 05:22:06.638 align:start position:0%
understand the symbolism that the old
 
05:22:09.670 --> 05:22:09.680 align:start position:0%
man represents for New Hampshire and as
 
05:22:12.270 --> 05:22:12.280 align:start position:0%
far as Live Free or Die General Stark
 
05:22:14.350 --> 05:22:14.360 align:start position:0%
wrote this as a toast to the Battle of
 
05:22:16.868 --> 05:22:16.878 align:start position:0%
Bennington a battle which helped America
 
05:22:19.750 --> 05:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
on his quest for Independence the fall
 
05:22:22.230 --> 05:22:22.240 align:start position:0%
quote is actually Live Free or Die death
 
05:22:24.830 --> 05:22:24.840 align:start position:0%
is not the greatest of evils New
 
05:22:26.390 --> 05:22:26.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is a state that fought to
 
05:22:28.830 --> 05:22:28.840 align:start position:0%
secure the FRS we all enjoy today
 
05:22:30.590 --> 05:22:30.600 align:start position:0%
putting Live Free or Die on the flag
 
05:22:32.750 --> 05:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
serves as a commemoration to our state's
 
05:22:35.590 --> 05:22:35.600 align:start position:0%
history and the freedoms we all enjoy
 
05:22:38.590 --> 05:22:38.600 align:start position:0%
today everyone what do you think of when
 
05:22:40.788 --> 05:22:40.798 align:start position:0%
you think of New Hampshire what I think
 
05:22:42.910 --> 05:22:42.920 align:start position:0%
about is the old man and live for your
 
05:22:45.548 --> 05:22:45.558 align:start position:0%
die both great symbols of the great
 
05:22:49.948 --> 05:22:49.958 align:start position:0%
Granite State as you may see my shirt as
 
05:22:52.430 --> 05:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
my design this will give you an idea of
 
05:22:54.430 --> 05:22:54.440 align:start position:0%
the flag that I
 
05:22:56.910 --> 05:22:56.920 align:start position:0%
propose I thank the chair and the

1016 and I'd like to open an executive
 
05:25:24.510 --> 05:25:24.520 align:start position:0%
session on cacr
 
05:25:28.030 --> 05:25:28.040 align:start position:0%
21 which is the oath of civil
 
05:25:32.150 --> 05:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
officers does someone have a motion
 
05:25:37.270 --> 05:25:37.280 align:start position:0%
representative groda yes hi um I mean
 
05:25:41.750 --> 05:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
yes yes Madam chair I move itl on cacr
 
05:25:46.670 --> 05:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
21 second seconded by uh representative
 
05:25:48.868 --> 05:25:48.878 align:start position:0%
gold all right do you wish to speak to
 
05:25:53.590 --> 05:25:53.600 align:start position:0%
your motion yes um I think the majority
 
05:25:55.708 --> 05:25:55.718 align:start position:0%
I don't want to generalize but we are
 
05:25:58.510 --> 05:25:58.520 align:start position:0%
this what we have now is working and if
 
05:26:00.750 --> 05:26:00.760 align:start position:0%
somebody doesn't want to use the word
 
05:26:04.270 --> 05:26:04.280 align:start position:0%
God they can opt out for that and I
 
05:26:07.788 --> 05:26:07.798 align:start position:0%
don't want that option to be the opt in
 
05:26:11.708 --> 05:26:11.718 align:start position:0%
option right I want our oath to be the
 
05:26:13.590 --> 05:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
oped in the one that's always there and
 
05:26:15.190 --> 05:26:15.200 align:start position:0%
if you don't want to have it you can
 
05:26:17.270 --> 05:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
choose something
 
05:26:19.270 --> 05:26:19.280 align:start position:0%
else thank
 
05:26:21.628 --> 05:26:21.638 align:start position:0%
you representative bu do you wish to
 
05:26:23.310 --> 05:26:23.320 align:start position:0%
speak to yourself I'll just add I I
 
05:26:25.510 --> 05:26:25.520 align:start position:0%
agree with everything representative
 
05:26:29.190 --> 05:26:29.200 align:start position:0%
grotus said and I will just add that um
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
my faith causes me to to um not swear an
 
05:26:38.548 --> 05:26:38.558 align:start position:0%
oath and so I choose the affirmation
 
05:26:42.830 --> 05:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
when it seems worth bothering somebody
 
05:26:46.590 --> 05:26:46.600 align:start position:0%
and so I understood the argument um in
 
05:26:49.750 --> 05:26:49.760 align:start position:0%
terms of the discomfort of asking for an
 
05:26:51.350 --> 05:26:51.360 align:start position:0%
alternative and having to think about it
 
05:26:53.670 --> 05:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
and all that but we are all different
 
05:26:57.390 --> 05:26:57.400 align:start position:0%
and we do have options and the majority
 
05:27:01.548 --> 05:27:01.558 align:start position:0%
likes what we have so I I and did this
 
05:27:04.788 --> 05:27:04.798 align:start position:0%
itl all right representative go leus and
 
05:27:07.190 --> 05:27:07.200 align:start position:0%
then Dolan okay I'm going to support the
 
05:27:10.670 --> 05:27:10.680 align:start position:0%
itl even though um I do pick the
 
05:27:13.948 --> 05:27:13.958 align:start position:0%
alternate oath um
 
05:27:17.030 --> 05:27:17.040 align:start position:0%
but you know I I would I would see that
 
05:27:19.190 --> 05:27:19.200 align:start position:0%
if we went to propose this it might be
 
05:27:19.200 --> 05:27:20.510 align:start position:0%
if we went to propose this it might be
perceived

05:27:20.510 --> 05:27:20.520 align:start position:0%
perceived
 
05:27:23.390 --> 05:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
maybe as the sponsor thought or maybe
 
05:27:26.470 --> 05:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
not uh but there could be problematic
 
05:27:28.670 --> 05:27:28.680 align:start position:0%
perceptions and I don't see it as a big
 
05:27:32.470 --> 05:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
problem and so I'm fine with the itail
 
05:27:34.948 --> 05:27:34.958 align:start position:0%
okay represent Dolan thank you madam
 
05:27:38.548 --> 05:27:38.558 align:start position:0%
chair uh I I object to
 
05:27:42.190 --> 05:27:42.200 align:start position:0%
the the uh the tendency that we have in
 
05:27:45.670 --> 05:27:45.680 align:start position:0%
society now to try to chase anything
 
05:27:48.910 --> 05:27:48.920 align:start position:0%
religious out of our lives or out of our
 
05:27:52.510 --> 05:27:52.520 align:start position:0%
uh daily processes I have a a a little
 
05:27:55.310 --> 05:27:55.320 align:start position:0%
bit of data from the Pew Research Center
 
05:27:57.110 --> 05:27:57.120 align:start position:0%
that says that people who are high
 
05:27:59.070 --> 05:27:59.080 align:start position:0%
highly religious are more engaged with
 
05:28:01.470 --> 05:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
their extended families more likely to
 
05:28:04.190 --> 05:28:04.200 align:start position:0%
be Volunteers in their Community more
 
05:28:05.670 --> 05:28:05.680 align:start position:0%
involved in their community and
 
05:28:07.310 --> 05:28:07.320 align:start position:0%
generally happier with the way their
 
05:28:09.990 --> 05:28:10.000 align:start position:0%
lives are going so I I think that we
 
05:28:12.670 --> 05:28:12.680 align:start position:0%
should uh try to retain as much
 
05:28:15.510 --> 05:28:15.520 align:start position:0%
traditional uh religious value that we
 
05:28:19.230 --> 05:28:19.240 align:start position:0%
have and and I I will be voting
 
05:28:24.868 --> 05:28:24.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:27.350 --> 05:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
question okay in that case the motion is
 
05:28:32.030 --> 05:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
in expedien to legislate on cacr
 
05:28:34.510 --> 05:28:34.520 align:start position:0%

right do think we should take up the
 
05:30:03.190 --> 05:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
flag or
 
05:30:04.990 --> 05:30:05.000 align:start position:0%
not what
 
05:30:05.000 --> 05:30:06.590 align:start position:0%
not what
yeah

05:30:06.590 --> 05:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:30:09.470 --> 05:30:09.480 align:start position:0%
okay um on House Bill
 
05:30:12.948 --> 05:30:12.958 align:start position:0%
1016 does someone have a
 
05:30:16.070 --> 05:30:16.080 align:start position:0%
motion I'll make a motion to itl House
 
05:30:16.080 --> 05:30:17.548 align:start position:0%
motion I'll make a motion to itl House
Bill

05:30:17.548 --> 05:30:17.558 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
05:30:17.558 --> 05:30:19.708 align:start position:0%
Bill
1016

05:30:19.708 --> 05:30:19.718 align:start position:0%
1016
 
05:30:22.628 --> 05:30:22.638 align:start position:0%
second all
 
05:30:28.350 --> 05:30:28.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:32.110 --> 05:30:32.120 align:start position:0%
motion I don't believe that the
 
05:30:34.830 --> 05:30:34.840 align:start position:0%
legislature should be making this
 
05:30:37.788 --> 05:30:37.798 align:start position:0%
decision if we want to change the flag
 
05:30:41.030 --> 05:30:41.040 align:start position:0%
we should let it be and we should have
 
05:30:43.310 --> 05:30:43.320 align:start position:0%
the our constituents involved in
 
05:30:46.430 --> 05:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
whatever way that happens so although
 
05:30:48.548 --> 05:30:48.558 align:start position:0%
maybe our flag is boring I never
 
05:30:51.310 --> 05:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
considered it boring frankly but that's
 
05:30:54.350 --> 05:30:54.360 align:start position:0%
you know apparently the opinion of
 
05:30:58.590 --> 05:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
people who study Flags um
 
05:31:01.470 --> 05:31:01.480 align:start position:0%
but Beauty is in the eye of the the
 
05:31:04.868 --> 05:31:04.878 align:start position:0%
beholder for me and um I don't see a
 
05:31:08.830 --> 05:31:08.840 align:start position:0%
reason that we need to to uh pass this
 
05:31:12.310 --> 05:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
bill okay represent gold I agree with
 
05:31:15.350 --> 05:31:15.360 align:start position:0%
everything representative groa just said
 
05:31:18.310 --> 05:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
and I not that long ago studied it
 
05:31:21.150 --> 05:31:21.160 align:start position:0%
myself when there was a big H hbla
 
05:31:22.830 --> 05:31:22.840 align:start position:0%
around the country about Native
 
05:31:24.830 --> 05:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
Americans on state flags and how they
 
05:31:27.470 --> 05:31:27.480 align:start position:0%
were depicted and was very thankful that
 
05:31:30.230 --> 05:31:30.240 align:start position:0%
we didn't have that to contend with so
 
05:31:34.270 --> 05:31:34.280 align:start position:0%
so I I I just agree this is not it's not
 
05:31:36.788 --> 05:31:36.798 align:start position:0%
an issue I think I loved the young man's
 
05:31:39.110 --> 05:31:39.120 align:start position:0%
presentation you know if the public
 
05:31:40.990 --> 05:31:41.000 align:start position:0%
wants to get involved and do something
 
05:31:44.470 --> 05:31:44.480 align:start position:0%
creative yay I agree yes representative
 
05:31:46.990 --> 05:31:47.000 align:start position:0%
laus yeah well I uh I strongly would
 
05:31:50.830 --> 05:31:50.840 align:start position:0%
like to see lrey die on the flag um I
 
05:31:52.990 --> 05:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
agree that you know probably needs a a
 
05:31:55.990 --> 05:31:56.000 align:start position:0%
more General redo and I'm not sure Edna
 
05:31:58.350 --> 05:31:58.360 align:start position:0%
is the best place to make that decision
 
05:31:59.628 --> 05:31:59.638 align:start position:0%
although if I had to vote for one or the
 
05:32:01.110 --> 05:32:01.120 align:start position:0%
other I probably would have voted for
 
05:32:03.390 --> 05:32:03.400 align:start position:0%
the the young fellow who
 
05:32:05.948 --> 05:32:05.958 align:start position:0%
testified yes representative Simon and
 
05:32:07.590 --> 05:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
then sure it thank you madam chair yeah
 
05:32:09.230 --> 05:32:09.240 align:start position:0%
I agree I'd love to see Li three or die
 
05:32:11.310 --> 05:32:11.320 align:start position:0%
on it but I do have this small concern
 
05:32:12.910 --> 05:32:12.920 align:start position:0%
that when it's flapping in the breeze
 
05:32:16.430 --> 05:32:16.440 align:start position:0%
it'll just say die um and so that does
 
05:32:18.830 --> 05:32:18.840 align:start position:0%
concern me a little bit all right
 
05:32:18.840 --> 05:32:20.510 align:start position:0%
concern me a little bit all right
representative

05:32:20.510 --> 05:32:20.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:32:25.230 --> 05:32:25.240 align:start position:0%
Shu thank you oh well as a trivia
 
05:32:28.708 --> 05:32:28.718 align:start position:0%
wonk I like having just what's there if
 
05:32:31.788 --> 05:32:31.798 align:start position:0%
you make it too too obvious then more
 
05:32:33.470 --> 05:32:33.480 align:start position:0%
people are going to know an answer if
 
05:32:36.270 --> 05:32:36.280 align:start position:0%
someone refers to that right now that
 
05:32:39.910 --> 05:32:39.920 align:start position:0%
I've I've actually um had the question
 
05:32:42.070 --> 05:32:42.080 align:start position:0%
what's the name of the ship on that and
 
05:32:43.910 --> 05:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
most people don't know it's the Raleigh
 
05:32:49.590 --> 05:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:32:52.868 --> 05:32:52.878 align:start position:0%
do that's where we
 
05:32:55.830 --> 05:32:55.840 align:start position:0%
are thank you madam chair and I think

how they young folks in the state are
 
05:33:12.510 --> 05:33:12.520 align:start position:0%

appointment at the dental Society uh

annual bash so don't talk too long
 
05:34:10.390 --> 05:34:10.400 align:start position:0%
Peter so I have 30 minutes to burn uh
 
05:34:12.470 --> 05:34:12.480 align:start position:0%
but but I agree with the initial
 
05:34:14.788 --> 05:34:14.798 align:start position:0%
statement was made it probably shouldn't
 
05:34:18.628 --> 05:34:18.638 align:start position:0%
be made by this committee like that I
 
05:34:20.750 --> 05:34:20.760 align:start position:0%
think the young man has whether he came
 
05:34:23.150 --> 05:34:23.160 align:start position:0%
up with it on on his own or with the
 
05:34:26.030 --> 05:34:26.040 align:start position:0%
help of anybody else is irrelevant to me
 
05:34:29.628 --> 05:34:29.638 align:start position:0%
but he's got an opportunity to to Market
 
05:34:32.070 --> 05:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
that design which I think would sell a
 
05:34:35.548 --> 05:34:35.558 align:start position:0%
lot of flags or pendants or whatever U
 
05:34:37.708 --> 05:34:37.718 align:start position:0%
but I think it really should be if we're
 
05:34:39.628 --> 05:34:39.638 align:start position:0%
going to take it up it should be taken
 
05:34:43.150 --> 05:34:43.160 align:start position:0%
up by experts and give the people a
 
05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
choice not however brilliant we might be
 
05:34:51.750 --> 05:34:51.760 align:start position:0%
to make a have it be done by us um so uh
 
05:34:55.470 --> 05:34:55.480 align:start position:0%
