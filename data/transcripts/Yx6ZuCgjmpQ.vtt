I am very pleased to be here because
 
00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 align:start position:0%
everyone who tried to mess up my
 
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 align:start position:0%
schedule today did a really good job of
 
00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 align:start position:0%
it and I got here like two minutes ago
 
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 align:start position:0%

um I'm here to introduce house bill 210.
 
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 align:start position:0%
I am an insurance agent by trade I sit
 
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
in the board of directors of the uh
 
00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 align:start position:0%
National Insurance agent Association and
 
00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
I've submitted this on the request of
 
00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 align:start position:0%
the insurance department
 
00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:54.379 align:start position:0%
the bill clarifies
 
00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 align:start position:0%
the items in the law that regulate fire
 
00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
insurance now in the old days I'm
 
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 align:start position:0%
talking about the 60s because this is
 
00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
what we're trying to do we're trying to
 
00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 align:start position:0%
replace something that is in the law
 
00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
that was written in the 60s and
 
00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 align:start position:0%
something that's also written in the 80s
 
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 align:start position:0%
that have a little bit of
 
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
redundancy in them and in the 60s
 
00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 align:start position:0%
insurance policies were very basic you
 
00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
had a fire policy and you had a
 
00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 align:start position:0%
liability policy and there were other
 
00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 align:start position:0%
different little things that were were
 
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
all separate little policies today
 
00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 align:start position:0%
you've all heard of the expression of
 
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 align:start position:0%
package policy everyone's talking on TV
 
00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599 align:start position:0%
about a bundle all right you put all
 
00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 align:start position:0%
this stuff together a Bop business
 
00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 align:start position:0%
owner's policy they put all this stuff
 
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
together and it has fire Insurance
 
00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 align:start position:0%
liability insurance cyber liability
 
00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
sewer and water backup all kinds of cool
 
00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 align:start position:0%
little things in there that insurance
 
00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 align:start position:0%
companies have learned over the last 30
 
00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 align:start position:0%
or 40 Years of what really happens in
 
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 align:start position:0%
life and how to make a policy that's
 
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 align:start position:0%
kind of address those things
 
00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 align:start position:0%
so the department recently removed older
 
00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:55.799 align:start position:0%
statutory language
 
00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 align:start position:0%
that is covered by more recent statues
 
00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 align:start position:0%
and a much more clear language RSA 4072
 
00:04:06.289 --> 00:04:06.299 align:start position:0%
a and 407 7 are effectively redundant
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
statutory sections within the same scope
 
00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 align:start position:0%
of what a fire insurance policy is
 
00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:14.099 align:start position:0%
as I said earlier one's newer ones in
 
00:04:16.189 --> 00:04:16.199 align:start position:0%
the 60s back when I was born
 
00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 align:start position:0%
one was more is in the 80s
 
00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 align:start position:0%
both statues in this case provide that
 
00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 align:start position:0%
fire Peril portions of any property
 
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 align:start position:0%
but other perils cover on the policy may
 
00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 align:start position:0%
vary those are things I just talked to
 
00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
you about other than just the fire
 
00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 align:start position:0%
policy if there's something about wind
 
00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 align:start position:0%
and there's something about hail and
 
00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:40.320 align:start position:0%
there's something about all these
 
00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:42.360 align:start position:0%
different things that the last time many
 
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 align:start position:0%
of you ever read all your insurance
 
00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 align:start position:0%
policies and they're all in there I'm
 
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 align:start position:0%
sure it's a it's a great read for a
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
Saturday night really after you're done
 
00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 align:start position:0%
reading the the state of New Hampshire
 
00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 align:start position:0%
budget you can read an insurance policy
 
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 align:start position:0%
so that really that's all it does is
 
00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
take two parts of the of current law
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
gets rid of one keeps the one that's uh
 
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:04.220 align:start position:0%
the newer version in uh 1980s version
 
00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 align:start position:0%
all about that very simple peril term we
 
00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
use Insurance business for a fire
 
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
I'll answer a few questions if you'd
 
00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 align:start position:0%
like but I'd rather have James Fox from
 
00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
the Department
 
00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:19.670 align:start position:0%
the Department
um

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 align:start position:0%
who really enjoys reading this stuff on
 
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
a Saturday night come and talk to you
 
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you very much for your
 
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.370 align:start position:0%
fair enough thank you very much for your
testimony

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 align:start position:0%
so the chair will call on
 
00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 align:start position:0%
James Fox in the insurance department
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
and in particular
 
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon my name is James Fox
 
00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 align:start position:0%
from the New Hampshire insurance
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
department I'm the PNC director with me
 
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 align:start position:0%
as Emily Doherty she's a PNC attorney
 
00:05:50.629 --> 00:05:50.639 align:start position:0%
you usually have stuff to add but a
 
00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 align:start position:0%
representative pretty much covered the
 
00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 align:start position:0%
waterfront on this one it is just a
 
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:56.390 align:start position:0%
waterfront on this one it is just a
modernization

00:05:56.390 --> 00:05:56.400 align:start position:0%
modernization
 
00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:57.350 align:start position:0%
modernization
um

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
issue that that we had two sections that
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
had the substantive parts were redundant
 
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 align:start position:0%
and it just goes back to the issue of
 
00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 align:start position:0%
the fire policy is the fire policy going
 
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280 align:start position:0%
all the way back to when it was mono
 
00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.170 align:start position:0%
all the way back to when it was mono
lines

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 align:start position:0%
lines
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
and those of you don't know the um fire
 
00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.160 align:start position:0%
policy is actually written into our
 
00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme 40722
 
00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:19.320 align:start position:0%
um and it goes back probably that
 
00:06:20.749 --> 00:06:20.759 align:start position:0%
standard file policy goes back to the
 
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
1800s so all of the standards that
 
00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 align:start position:0%
circular around that all the 407
 
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
standards are designed for fire and this
 
00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 align:start position:0%
just says this is for fire not for other
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
perils so I'm not changing the law we're
 
00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:34.860 align:start position:0%
just having one standard that's in
 
00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 align:start position:0%
essence like once one set of language
 
00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:38.759 align:start position:0%
really as opposed to two and causing
 
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 align:start position:0%
okay uh any questions from community
 
00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.390 align:start position:0%

was a um they had him on a list and then
 
00:17:13.490 --> 00:17:13.500 align:start position:0%
I got so excited about putting it into
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
this date I didn't look at it and say oh
 
00:17:19.250 --> 00:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
my God I had too much time allocated uh
 
00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
but we're doing good in terms of getting
 
00:17:22.549 --> 00:17:22.559 align:start position:0%
bills scheduled

everything have done in terms of
 
00:17:30.230 --> 00:17:30.240 align:start position:0%
scheduling and then we will um I might
 
00:17:33.470 --> 00:17:33.480 align:start position:0%
try for another exact session again next
 
00:17:36.049 --> 00:17:36.059 align:start position:0%
week in terms of you know subcommittee
 
00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:37.500 align:start position:0%
in the morning an exec session in the
 
00:17:37.500 --> 00:17:38.750 align:start position:0%
in the morning an exec session in the
afternoon

00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:17:38.760 --> 00:17:40.070 align:start position:0%
afternoon
um

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:41.630 --> 00:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
the other thing I would tell you I want
 
00:17:43.130 --> 00:17:43.140 align:start position:0%
everybody to know that in terms of
 
00:17:46.010 --> 00:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
Tomorrow the subcommittee work you can
 
00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:47.760 align:start position:0%
see that they were originally laid out
 
00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:50.160 align:start position:0%
by the two different uh committees but
 
00:17:52.370 --> 00:17:52.380 align:start position:0%
it looks like one liquor one got kind of
 
00:17:54.130 --> 00:17:54.140 align:start position:0%
moved up or there was something little
 
00:17:57.529 --> 00:17:57.539 align:start position:0%
and then we also have in terms of the
 
00:17:57.539 --> 00:17:59.029 align:start position:0%
and then we also have in terms of the
hearings

00:17:59.029 --> 00:17:59.039 align:start position:0%
hearings
 
00:18:01.669 --> 00:18:01.679 align:start position:0%
um at the end there was a bill that just
 
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:04.260 align:start position:0%
got vacated to this committee which is
 
00:18:06.710 --> 00:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
that pharmaceutical board that we had
 
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:09.240 align:start position:0%
the issue that there was another bill
 
00:18:11.049 --> 00:18:11.059 align:start position:0%
which is to get rid of it all together
 
00:18:14.450 --> 00:18:14.460 align:start position:0%
okay so a we so we have these two bills
 
00:18:17.630 --> 00:18:17.640 align:start position:0%
we have one is that that how do we
 
00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:20.100 align:start position:0%
improve upon it I guess and the other
 
00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
one is just to throw the towel in on it
 
00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:23.630 align:start position:0%
one is just to throw the towel in on it
so

00:18:23.630 --> 00:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:18:26.510 --> 00:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
um I I schedule that right away so at
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%
least we had that available to us so we
 
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:31.460 align:start position:0%
can we know you know we have those tools
 
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:34.140 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure either one of them is due
 
00:18:36.289 --> 00:18:36.299 align:start position:0%
out early
 
00:18:37.789 --> 00:18:37.799 align:start position:0%
um because I'm trying to push the early
 
00:18:40.490 --> 00:18:40.500 align:start position:0%
bills uh and in terms of exact session
 
00:18:43.549 --> 00:18:43.559 align:start position:0%
so in terms of what happens uh tomorrow
 
00:18:46.730 --> 00:18:46.740 align:start position:0%
and then the exact session my attitude
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
is that uh we're gonna meet with these
 
00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
talk about these bills get a feeling for
 
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:55.260 align:start position:0%
where everybody is on a bill
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
um if it becomes clear to me that a bill
 
00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:00.620 align:start position:0%
is going to be right down the party line
 
00:19:03.409 --> 00:19:03.419 align:start position:0%
and it's not going to vary then
 
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:05.340 align:start position:0%
obviously my attitude is we should just
 
00:19:07.730 --> 00:19:07.740 align:start position:0%
retain it we don't and why why get us
 
00:19:09.650 --> 00:19:09.660 align:start position:0%
into an awkward situation on the House
 
00:19:09.660 --> 00:19:11.090 align:start position:0%
into an awkward situation on the House
for

00:19:11.090 --> 00:19:11.100 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and and therefore
 
00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:15.650 align:start position:0%
um and uh and and and therefore
hopefully

00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:15.660 align:start position:0%
hopefully
 
00:19:17.810 --> 00:19:17.820 align:start position:0%
over the over the summer and come next
 
00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:19.980 align:start position:0%
September when we take up retained bills
 
00:19:22.330 --> 00:19:22.340 align:start position:0%
we can get some of those issues resolved
 
00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:24.840 align:start position:0%
and so that we could have something that
 
00:19:27.350 --> 00:19:27.360 align:start position:0%
we all can agree on which is better than
 
00:19:28.909 --> 00:19:28.919 align:start position:0%
sending something to the floor where
 
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
it's just a partisan battle and then
 
00:19:33.169 --> 00:19:33.179 align:start position:0%
it's everybody all worried about who's
 
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:46.260 align:start position:0%
like maybe maybe I don't know right so
 
00:19:49.690 --> 00:19:49.700 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%
her point was saying that she felt like
 
00:19:54.289 --> 00:19:54.299 align:start position:0%
last year we didn't spend enough time on
 
00:19:56.330 --> 00:19:56.340 align:start position:0%
retained bills
 
00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080 align:start position:0%
um you know and we could have spent more
 
00:20:00.350 --> 00:20:00.360 align:start position:0%
but I I actually what cramped us last
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
year was certain members
 
00:20:06.230 --> 00:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
were on vacation in Europe
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
not you guys you're the ones who are
 
00:20:09.890 --> 00:20:09.900 align:start position:0%
here you're the ones running for
 
00:20:11.930 --> 00:20:11.940 align:start position:0%
reelection it was the ones who weren't
 
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:14.520 align:start position:0%
running for re-election that were on
 
00:20:18.830 --> 00:20:18.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:19.909 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:22.140 align:start position:0%
okay well we can certainly spend more
 
00:20:24.770 --> 00:20:24.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
it was the you covered leftovers right
 
00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:29.340 align:start position:0%
so but
 
00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.610 align:start position:0%
so but
anyway

00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:31.620 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:32.510 align:start position:0%
anyway
um

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:32.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
all right we're close enough uh we'll
 
00:20:37.610 --> 00:20:37.620 align:start position:0%
open up the hearing on uh House Bill 479
 
00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%

infantine from Manchester Hillsboro 16.
 
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
I'm here to introduce House Bill 479
 
00:20:57.710 --> 00:20:57.720 align:start position:0%
um I am as I said earlier I am in in the
 
00:21:00.110 --> 00:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
insurance industry and have been for 30
 
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
or 34 years and I sit in the national
 
00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:05.100 align:start position:0%
board of directors of our association
 
00:21:07.130 --> 00:21:07.140 align:start position:0%
I am here at the request of the
 
00:21:08.690 --> 00:21:08.700 align:start position:0%
insurance department
 
00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:11.940 align:start position:0%
to place an Omnibus type Bill making
 
00:21:15.289 --> 00:21:15.299 align:start position:0%
several changes uh I'll I'll be at minor
 
00:21:16.610 --> 00:21:16.620 align:start position:0%
to three different parts of the
 
00:21:17.930 --> 00:21:17.940 align:start position:0%
insurance law
 
00:21:20.210 --> 00:21:20.220 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to go through as I talk
 
00:21:24.409 --> 00:21:24.419 align:start position:0%
each line as we go down here on page one
 
00:21:26.390 --> 00:21:26.400 align:start position:0%
basically the first page lines one
 
00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:28.380 align:start position:0%
through 25
 
00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:29.940 align:start position:0%
and all the way to the bottom of the
 
00:21:33.049 --> 00:21:33.059 align:start position:0%
page and the beginning part the first
 
00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:37.140 align:start position:0%
five first ten lines of page two have to
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
do with when an insurance company
 
00:21:43.070 --> 00:21:43.080 align:start position:0%
comes in front of the insurance
 
00:21:44.750 --> 00:21:44.760 align:start position:0%
department for any kind of
 
00:21:46.789 --> 00:21:46.799 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing
 
00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:48.480 align:start position:0%
situation where they're at fault for
 
00:21:50.810 --> 00:21:50.820 align:start position:0%
doing something they're not doing
 
00:21:52.789 --> 00:21:52.799 align:start position:0%
something the insurance department likes
 
00:21:53.870 --> 00:21:53.880 align:start position:0%
or they want to have a conversation
 
00:21:55.010 --> 00:21:55.020 align:start position:0%
about something with the insurance
 
00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.029 align:start position:0%
about something with the insurance
department

00:21:56.029 --> 00:21:56.039 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:58.320 align:start position:0%
so some of the major changes are are
 
00:22:00.289 --> 00:22:00.299 align:start position:0%
simply changing the word from he to the
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
commissioner adding an or
 
00:22:06.669 --> 00:22:06.679 align:start position:0%
um and just some very few small little
 
00:22:09.710 --> 00:22:09.720 align:start position:0%
changes to what the procedure is going
 
00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:11.760 align:start position:0%
to be the largest being online is 19
 
00:22:14.049 --> 00:22:14.059 align:start position:0%
through 25
 
00:22:18.049 --> 00:22:18.059 align:start position:0%
just gives them a time frame of when
 
00:22:20.570 --> 00:22:20.580 align:start position:0%
everyone has to respond
 
00:22:22.909 --> 00:22:22.919 align:start position:0%
when the applicant request May request
 
00:22:25.070 --> 00:22:25.080 align:start position:0%
additional time so if the commissioner
 
00:22:25.080 --> 00:22:26.750 align:start position:0%
additional time so if the commissioner
calls

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:26.760 align:start position:0%
calls
 
00:22:28.610 --> 00:22:28.620 align:start position:0%
insurance company in and they say you
 
00:22:30.409 --> 00:22:30.419 align:start position:0%
want to talk about X Y and Z and the
 
00:22:33.470 --> 00:22:33.480 align:start position:0%
insurance company has to
 
00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:35.280 align:start position:0%
go get a whole bunch of information they
 
00:22:37.370 --> 00:22:37.380 align:start position:0%
can request additional time
 
00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
so really the first page of this bill
 
00:22:42.890 --> 00:22:42.900 align:start position:0%
has to do with understanding
 
00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.460 align:start position:0%
if there's an administrative hearing
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
just redefining what some of the rules
 
00:22:50.029 --> 00:22:50.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:54.409 --> 00:22:54.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.370 --> 00:23:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:01.380 --> 00:23:03.890 align:start position:0%
 
sorry

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:06.299 align:start position:0%
oh Roman numeral eight
 
00:23:08.149 --> 00:23:08.159 align:start position:0%
um it says the commissioner shall
 
00:23:09.529 --> 00:23:09.539 align:start position:0%
provide notice to the insurer by
 
00:23:12.230 --> 00:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
electronic means specified by the
 
00:23:15.110 --> 00:23:15.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner the goal here was to update
 
00:23:17.570 --> 00:23:17.580 align:start position:0%
how we do things you know in the old
 
00:23:19.549 --> 00:23:19.559 align:start position:0%
days it would say certified mail or or
 
00:23:22.430 --> 00:23:22.440 align:start position:0%
something and now we're trying to
 
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:24.230 align:start position:0%
something and now we're trying to
um

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:26.810 --> 00:23:26.820 align:start position:0%
actually bring it up to more modern
 
00:23:31.010 --> 00:23:31.020 align:start position:0%
times however in reviewing this it was
 
00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:35.880 align:start position:0%
determined that on line 15 where it says
 
00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.460 align:start position:0%
thus the last two two words on line 15
 
00:23:43.970 --> 00:23:43.980 align:start position:0%
when either posted on the department's
 
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:45.590 align:start position:0%
when either posted on the department's
website

00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:45.600 align:start position:0%
website
 
00:23:48.409 --> 00:23:48.419 align:start position:0%
and then the next line the posting on
 
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:51.000 align:start position:0%
the department's website were proving to
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
be not allowable by New Hampshire law
 
00:24:01.090 --> 00:24:01.100 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:03.649 --> 00:24:03.659 align:start position:0%
2023-0206h which I handed out
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
you will note makes those changes
 
00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:09.049 align:start position:0%
you will note makes those changes
removes

00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:09.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:12.000 align:start position:0%
on line 15 and 16 when either post on
 
00:24:14.529 --> 00:24:14.539 align:start position:0%
the department's website and in line 17
 
00:24:18.049 --> 00:24:18.059 align:start position:0%
posting on the department's website
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
those have been removed
 
00:24:21.529 --> 00:24:21.539 align:start position:0%
and that's the only difference in the
 
00:24:21.539 --> 00:24:24.590 align:start position:0%
and that's the only difference in the
amendment

00:24:24.590 --> 00:24:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:28.090 --> 00:24:28.100 align:start position:0%
the third part of this bill clarifies
 
00:24:32.770 --> 00:24:32.780 align:start position:0%
dishonest acts by Insurance Producers
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
activities that could negatively affect
 
00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:36.720 align:start position:0%
the producer's license even those
 
00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:38.700 align:start position:0%
activities are not insurance
 
00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:41.460 align:start position:0%
business activities
 
00:24:44.810 --> 00:24:44.820 align:start position:0%
the commissioner wants
 
00:24:47.029 --> 00:24:47.039 align:start position:0%
something in the law that he has the
 
00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:48.900 align:start position:0%
ability to take someone like my
 
00:24:50.930 --> 00:24:50.940 align:start position:0%
insurance license away if I do something
 
00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.950 align:start position:0%
insurance license away if I do something
wrong

00:24:51.950 --> 00:24:51.960 align:start position:0%
wrong
 
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
if I take the if I steal the money out
 
00:24:57.049 --> 00:24:57.059 align:start position:0%
of the John Hunt and shouldn't have your
 
00:24:59.710 --> 00:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
cell phone ringing in committee bucket
 
00:25:02.390 --> 00:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
and I get turned in for stealing that
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
money the commissioner needs to know
 
00:25:07.130 --> 00:25:07.140 align:start position:0%
whether or not that is something that
 
00:25:09.110 --> 00:25:09.120 align:start position:0%
will affect my ability to be an
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
insurance agent and have that license
 
00:25:14.510 --> 00:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
and it gives the um
 
00:25:16.549 --> 00:25:16.559 align:start position:0%
commissioner the ability to make some
 
00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:20.100 align:start position:0%
changes you will see on page three
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
it really starts on the last part
 
00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.169 align:start position:0%
it really starts on the last part
um

00:25:26.169 --> 00:25:26.179 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
line 36 a through H these are all kinds
 
00:25:32.570 --> 00:25:32.580 align:start position:0%
of things that will get you in trouble
 
00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:34.080 align:start position:0%
with the insurance commissioner if you
 
00:25:36.169 --> 00:25:36.179 align:start position:0%
have an insurance license we're trying
 
00:25:39.049 --> 00:25:39.059 align:start position:0%
to amend letter h
 
00:25:42.169 --> 00:25:42.179 align:start position:0%
and you'll see in bold type
 
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:43.980 align:start position:0%
whether directly as an individual or
 
00:25:46.610 --> 00:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
through activities for an entity in any
 
00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
conduct of any business activities or
 
00:25:52.070 --> 00:25:52.080 align:start position:0%
fraud misre representation or conversion
 
00:25:54.289 --> 00:25:54.299 align:start position:0%
of funds funds misrepresentation or
 
00:25:56.029 --> 00:25:56.039 align:start position:0%
breach of fiduciary duty involving
 
00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:03.289 --> 00:26:03.299 align:start position:0%
we met an insurance agents Association
 
00:26:05.810 --> 00:26:05.820 align:start position:0%
met with the uh
 
00:26:07.490 --> 00:26:07.500 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner about this and
 
00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:09.360 align:start position:0%
we're a little concerned thought it went
 
00:26:11.930 --> 00:26:11.940 align:start position:0%
maybe a little too far
 
00:26:13.390 --> 00:26:13.400 align:start position:0%
um obviously
 
00:26:16.730 --> 00:26:16.740 align:start position:0%
never know what can happen in the future
 
00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:19.440 align:start position:0%
don't want someone's license adversely
 
00:26:21.350 --> 00:26:21.360 align:start position:0%
effective because it's something totally
 
00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:24.299 align:start position:0%
absent or different from their job as an
 
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
insurance agent But realize the
 
00:26:28.789 --> 00:26:28.799 align:start position:0%
insurance commission needs that ability
 
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
if someone does something through
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
another organization
 
00:26:36.649 --> 00:26:36.659 align:start position:0%
um he has the ability then to affect the
 
00:26:39.649 --> 00:26:39.659 align:start position:0%
license of an insurance agent
 
00:26:42.409 --> 00:26:42.419 align:start position:0%
so those are the three changes
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
any questions from committee members yes
 
00:26:57.649 --> 00:26:57.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:00.840 align:start position:0%
thank you uh this could be a nitpicky
 
00:27:04.789 --> 00:27:04.799 align:start position:0%
question but I in in section four you
 
00:27:06.110 --> 00:27:06.120 align:start position:0%
talk about
 
00:27:09.289 --> 00:27:09.299 align:start position:0%
exigent circumstances being one of them
 
00:27:11.570 --> 00:27:11.580 align:start position:0%
being irreparably uh I think it says
 
00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:13.380 align:start position:0%
irreparably harmed
 
00:27:15.289 --> 00:27:15.299 align:start position:0%
could you tell me what irreparably
 
00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:22.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
because at the same I'm sorry at the
 
00:27:26.330 --> 00:27:26.340 align:start position:0%
same time you also say that you have 30
 
00:27:28.610 --> 00:27:28.620 align:start position:0%
days so I don't know 30 days seems like
 
00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:29.940 align:start position:0%
you could
 
00:27:34.010 --> 00:27:34.020 align:start position:0%
be very irreparably harmed I believe I
 
00:27:36.289 --> 00:27:36.299 align:start position:0%
have an idea of a circumstance where
 
00:27:37.610 --> 00:27:37.620 align:start position:0%
that would happen
 
00:27:39.049 --> 00:27:39.059 align:start position:0%
I'm going to let the insurance
 
00:27:42.649 --> 00:27:42.659 align:start position:0%
department speak but there are any kind
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
of situation where someone has thousands
 
00:27:47.029 --> 00:27:47.039 align:start position:0%
of insurance policies out there
 
00:27:50.090 --> 00:27:50.100 align:start position:0%
and if something is going on where the
 
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:53.340 align:start position:0%
insurance department feels that um it
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
needs to be done immediately and if not
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
something is not done there will be
 
00:28:00.470 --> 00:28:00.480 align:start position:0%
irreparable harm down the line that is
 
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:03.000 align:start position:0%
my understanding but I'm going to
 
00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:05.760 align:start position:0%
um politely not surmise
 
00:28:07.549 --> 00:28:07.559 align:start position:0%
and let the insurance department answer
 
00:28:10.970 --> 00:28:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:12.909 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:28:12.909 --> 00:28:12.919 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:28:16.730 --> 00:28:16.740 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative
 
00:28:16.740 --> 00:28:18.289 align:start position:0%
anybody else representative
oh

00:28:18.289 --> 00:28:18.299 align:start position:0%
oh
 
00:28:20.390 --> 00:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
Russian Immaculate uh thank you
 
00:28:24.110 --> 00:28:24.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner so the way I read this you
 
00:28:26.510 --> 00:28:26.520 align:start position:0%
could do something that's totally out of
 
00:28:28.730 --> 00:28:28.740 align:start position:0%
the insurance field and yet the and the
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
insurance department can pull your
 
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
license you you rob a convenience store
 
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:35.400 align:start position:0%
in Florida they can pull your insurance
 
00:28:38.750 --> 00:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
license may they may okay
 
00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:41.400 align:start position:0%
gives them a little more flexibility of
 
00:28:42.769 --> 00:28:42.779 align:start position:0%
whether or not
 
00:28:44.930 --> 00:28:44.940 align:start position:0%
um you know because I I brought up a
 
00:28:49.630 --> 00:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
situation you know uh I'm having uh
 
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:52.380 align:start position:0%
drinks with another couple and my wife
 
00:28:54.310 --> 00:28:54.320 align:start position:0%
at a local establishment and someone
 
00:28:56.870 --> 00:28:56.880 align:start position:0%
touches my wife inappropriately and I
 
00:28:59.750 --> 00:28:59.760 align:start position:0%
hit the guy and I get arrested for
 
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:01.020 align:start position:0%
something now this is more financial
 
00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
just talking about this one but you know
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
there's always going to be a situation
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
where would that be good enough to take
 
00:29:08.630 --> 00:29:08.640 align:start position:0%
my insurance license away probably not
 
00:29:11.149 --> 00:29:11.159 align:start position:0%
if I was involved with a non-profit
 
00:29:13.610 --> 00:29:13.620 align:start position:0%
organization and I miss appropriated
 
00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:16.140 align:start position:0%
some funds that could be grounds for the
 
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:17.460 align:start position:0%
insurance commissioner to take away my
 
00:29:23.389 --> 00:29:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:27.850 --> 00:29:27.860 align:start position:0%
okay are we all set thank you
 
00:29:27.860 --> 00:29:29.810 align:start position:0%
okay are we all set thank you
and

00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:29.820 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:46.370 --> 00:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
good afternoon my name is Heather
 
00:29:50.269 --> 00:29:50.279 align:start position:0%
Silverstein I'm general counsel from the
 
00:29:52.610 --> 00:29:52.620 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire insurance department
 
00:29:56.630 --> 00:29:56.640 align:start position:0%
um yes this Omnibus Bill is again oh
 
00:29:59.630 --> 00:29:59.640 align:start position:0%
I've spoken before about us reviewing
 
00:30:01.730 --> 00:30:01.740 align:start position:0%
our statutes as we go along in practice
 
00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:05.700 align:start position:0%
and as we notice that they have issues
 
00:30:09.049 --> 00:30:09.059 align:start position:0%
we do try to make changes we do try to
 
00:30:11.029 --> 00:30:11.039 align:start position:0%
come to the legislature and say uh this
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
is not working exactly as we would have
 
00:30:14.510 --> 00:30:14.520 align:start position:0%
hoped and we're trying to make it better
 
00:30:17.210 --> 00:30:17.220 align:start position:0%
and this is another example of that with
 
00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:19.140 align:start position:0%
regard to the administrative hearings
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
piece of this and HB 479
 
00:30:24.649 --> 00:30:24.659 align:start position:0%
we're clarifying the time for
 
00:30:24.659 --> 00:30:26.049 align:start position:0%
we're clarifying the time for
um

00:30:26.049 --> 00:30:26.059 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:29.750 --> 00:30:29.760 align:start position:0%
asking for a hearing so when a licensee
 
00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
needs has a hearing they've been
 
00:30:33.470 --> 00:30:33.480 align:start position:0%
aggrieved by some decision of the
 
00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:34.860 align:start position:0%
commissioner and they want to go to
 
00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:38.520 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing uh our RSA 400a17
 
00:30:41.090 --> 00:30:41.100 align:start position:0%
is the mechanism to do that
 
00:30:43.669 --> 00:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
um in the past it was a 30-day window we
 
00:30:44.990 --> 00:30:45.000 align:start position:0%
would have to go to a hearing right away
 
00:30:47.450 --> 00:30:47.460 align:start position:0%
now I've been a hearing officer before
 
00:30:50.090 --> 00:30:50.100 align:start position:0%
and to get that hearing within 30 days
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
for every single request can be
 
00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:55.140 align:start position:0%
difficult sometimes but that's not the
 
00:30:56.810 --> 00:30:56.820 align:start position:0%
only reason that we would change this
 
00:30:59.990 --> 00:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
there's times when we have a license to
 
00:31:02.990 --> 00:31:03.000 align:start position:0%
say the sky is falling I need a hearing
 
00:31:04.789 --> 00:31:04.799 align:start position:0%
like next week
 
00:31:06.769 --> 00:31:06.779 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:09.720 align:start position:0%
the licensee realizes oh dear I'm not
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
going to be ready for you next week or I
 
00:31:15.710 --> 00:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
have other matters that are going to tie
 
00:31:17.630 --> 00:31:17.640 align:start position:0%
into this hearing and then we'll maybe
 
00:31:19.789 --> 00:31:19.799 align:start position:0%
get a motion that says please continue
 
00:31:23.630 --> 00:31:23.640 align:start position:0%
this out for 60 days so it's so for us
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
you know it's very
 
00:31:29.690 --> 00:31:29.700 align:start position:0%
um difficult to kind of uh reconcile
 
00:31:32.810 --> 00:31:32.820 align:start position:0%
that so this is to try to
 
00:31:35.090 --> 00:31:35.100 align:start position:0%
um help the licensee kind of figure out
 
00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:36.840 align:start position:0%
that timing yes if you need something
 
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840 align:start position:0%
within 60 days because
 
00:31:41.450 --> 00:31:41.460 align:start position:0%
there's going to be harm irreparable
 
00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:43.620 align:start position:0%
harm and they would have to just file a
 
00:31:45.409 --> 00:31:45.419 align:start position:0%
motion and then say what that is we have
 
00:31:48.110 --> 00:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
a license that say I need to work you
 
00:31:50.389 --> 00:31:50.399 align:start position:0%
know I I can't you know I'm not going to
 
00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:51.840 align:start position:0%
be able to go forward if this isn't if
 
00:31:53.990 --> 00:31:54.000 align:start position:0%
this hearing isn't resolved and because
 
00:31:56.090 --> 00:31:56.100 align:start position:0%
I have licenses and other
 
00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:57.289 align:start position:0%
I have licenses and other
States

00:31:57.289 --> 00:31:57.299 align:start position:0%
States
 
00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:00.120 align:start position:0%
and those licenses are affected by
 
00:32:01.549 --> 00:32:01.559 align:start position:0%
Administrative Hearings in our States
 
00:32:03.049 --> 00:32:03.059 align:start position:0%
because we talk to each other the states
 
00:32:06.409 --> 00:32:06.419 align:start position:0%
talk to each other as they should so
 
00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:08.520 align:start position:0%
this part of the statute is really just
 
00:32:10.430 --> 00:32:10.440 align:start position:0%
to clean that up as far as the timing
 
00:32:12.789 --> 00:32:12.799 align:start position:0%
goes for the hearings
 
00:32:15.769 --> 00:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
and for the administrative fund piece
 
00:32:19.269 --> 00:32:19.279 align:start position:0%
that's making changes to RSA 400a 39.
 
00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:21.960 align:start position:0%
this is bringing us up to speed so that
 
00:32:25.190 --> 00:32:25.200 align:start position:0%
we can just provide notices as to when
 
00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:27.720 align:start position:0%
these their fee that's due from our
 
00:32:30.049 --> 00:32:30.059 align:start position:0%
licensees and to to just provide that
 
00:32:31.669 --> 00:32:31.679 align:start position:0%
electronic knows is fine they can
 
00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:33.899 align:start position:0%
receive an email and that's sufficient
 
00:32:38.090 --> 00:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
instead of actual U.S mail and again the
 
00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:40.140 align:start position:0%
amendment is to the posting on the
 
00:32:42.289 --> 00:32:42.299 align:start position:0%
website we where we're drawing that
 
00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
we're not going to consider that to be
 
00:32:46.669 --> 00:32:46.679 align:start position:0%
proper notice just the email notice and
 
00:32:48.590 --> 00:32:48.600 align:start position:0%
then the last piece of this is whether
 
00:32:50.570 --> 00:32:50.580 align:start position:0%
the insurance producer regulation under
 
00:32:55.090 --> 00:32:55.100 align:start position:0%
RSA 402j and this is
 
00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
expanding a bit more on the RSA 402 j12h
 
00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:01.620 align:start position:0%
with regard to dishonest business
 
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:05.100 align:start position:0%
practices and just to clarify it's not
 
00:33:08.090 --> 00:33:08.100 align:start position:0%
just Insurance business practices uh
 
00:33:10.190 --> 00:33:10.200 align:start position:0%
let's say a trustee misappropriates
 
00:33:13.130 --> 00:33:13.140 align:start position:0%
money of a trust that's problematic you
 
00:33:14.990 --> 00:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want that person
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
handling uh money up in shorts you know
 
00:33:21.769 --> 00:33:21.779 align:start position:0%
to be a producer so it gives the
 
00:33:24.649 --> 00:33:24.659 align:start position:0%
commissioner more leeway to
 
00:33:24.659 --> 00:33:25.490 align:start position:0%
commissioner more leeway to
um

00:33:25.490 --> 00:33:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:27.769 --> 00:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
suspend or take a license if that's
 
00:33:29.450 --> 00:33:29.460 align:start position:0%
necessary and if that's proven at a
 
00:33:30.529 --> 00:33:30.539 align:start position:0%
hearing so
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
if you have any questions I'd be happy
 
00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
to take them
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:41.509 --> 00:33:41.519 align:start position:0%
thank you I'm asking the same question I
 
00:33:43.430 --> 00:33:43.440 align:start position:0%
I this is kind of new for me so I'm
 
00:33:45.230 --> 00:33:45.240 align:start position:0%
trying to understand what is irreparable
 
00:33:48.110 --> 00:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
harm irreparable harm is similar to the
 
00:33:49.730 --> 00:33:49.740 align:start position:0%
idea that I was talking about like
 
00:33:52.549 --> 00:33:52.559 align:start position:0%
someone's livelihood like I need this
 
00:33:54.049 --> 00:33:54.059 align:start position:0%
hearing right away because this is
 
00:33:55.730 --> 00:33:55.740 align:start position:0%
affecting my livelihood that's a very
 
00:33:57.590 --> 00:33:57.600 align:start position:0%
good example and that is actually pretty
 
00:34:01.009 --> 00:34:01.019 align:start position:0%
commonly argued to us like this notice
 
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:02.480 align:start position:0%
of this hearing
 
00:34:05.149 --> 00:34:05.159 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing the way the laws
 
00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:08.040 align:start position:0%
work with producers Nationwide is that
 
00:34:10.070 --> 00:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
other states find out that there's
 
00:34:13.310 --> 00:34:13.320 align:start position:0%
administrative hearing and so
 
00:34:15.950 --> 00:34:15.960 align:start position:0%
um then that their other states may
 
00:34:18.409 --> 00:34:18.419 align:start position:0%
start taking action and so this the
 
00:34:20.770 --> 00:34:20.780 align:start position:0%
licensee is
 
00:34:23.210 --> 00:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
asserting we need to resolve this right
 
00:34:24.649 --> 00:34:24.659 align:start position:0%
away because I just need to wrap this up
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:33.470 --> 00:34:33.480 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from team
 
00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:34.490 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions from team
members

Edwards

00:58:40.319 --> 00:58:46.309 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

00:58:46.309 --> 00:58:46.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:48.650 --> 00:58:48.660 align:start position:0%
so uh thank you Mr chair I'm
 
00:58:51.289 --> 00:58:51.299 align:start position:0%
representative Jess Edwards representing
 
00:58:55.430 --> 00:58:55.440 align:start position:0%
Rockingham District 31. uh that's a
 
00:58:58.490 --> 00:58:58.500 align:start position:0%
combination of Auburn Candia
 
00:59:02.750 --> 00:59:02.760 align:start position:0%
Chester and Deerfield I'm here today to
 
00:59:06.650 --> 00:59:06.660 align:start position:0%
introduce house bill 130.
 
00:59:10.190 --> 00:59:10.200 align:start position:0%
um this is uh this is a kind of a
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
companion bill
 
00:59:15.470 --> 00:59:15.480 align:start position:0%
to House Bill 172 that we we talked
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
about last week my my co-sponsor Peter
 
00:59:22.150 --> 00:59:22.160 align:start position:0%
leishman was not able to be here today
 
00:59:25.010 --> 00:59:25.020 align:start position:0%
otherwise he would have uh I really
 
00:59:28.849 --> 00:59:28.859 align:start position:0%
valued his uh his testimony last week on
 
00:59:33.650 --> 00:59:33.660 align:start position:0%
172 and would encourage you that you you
 
00:59:37.730 --> 00:59:37.740 align:start position:0%
consult his testimony of as as though it
 
00:59:41.150 --> 00:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
was also on HP 130 because everything he
 
00:59:45.710 --> 00:59:45.720 align:start position:0%
said is still the case the distinction
 
00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
between 130 and 172 is that
 
00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:51.609 align:start position:0%
between 130 and 172 is that
um

00:59:51.609 --> 00:59:51.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:56.329 --> 00:59:56.339 align:start position:0%
172 essentially said uh let's let's take
 
01:00:00.289 --> 01:00:00.299 align:start position:0%
a pause and take a look at uh redundancy
 
01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
issues and make sure that we're doing
 
01:00:04.849 --> 01:00:04.859 align:start position:0%
the best that we can for our taxpayers
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
before we Levy a new tax
 
01:00:11.750 --> 01:00:11.760 align:start position:0%
and this is uh kind of the the harder
 
01:00:14.390 --> 01:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
end of it which is to say let's just
 
01:00:16.430 --> 01:00:16.440 align:start position:0%
repeal the prescription drug
 
01:00:19.670 --> 01:00:19.680 align:start position:0%
affordability board outright and I
 
01:00:22.849 --> 01:00:22.859 align:start position:0%
wanted to do this to give the give some
 
01:00:25.789 --> 01:00:25.799 align:start position:0%
clarity to what decisions are before us
 
01:00:29.089 --> 01:00:29.099 align:start position:0%
and what the motivations are and and
 
01:00:30.710 --> 01:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
give the committee an opportunity to
 
01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:32.940 align:start position:0%
decide you know which which is a
 
01:00:35.930 --> 01:00:35.940 align:start position:0%
preferable way to go
 
01:00:39.230 --> 01:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
um I uh I could see just repealing it
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
outright for much of the reasons I I
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
said last week and I'll I'll hit some
 
01:00:48.049 --> 01:00:48.059 align:start position:0%
high points there that I think uh need
 
01:00:50.329 --> 01:00:50.339 align:start position:0%
to be hit because
 
01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I think in subsequent testimony that
 
01:00:56.030 --> 01:00:56.040 align:start position:0%
day some things that were said and
 
01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:57.069 align:start position:0%
day some things that were said and
implied

01:00:57.069 --> 01:00:57.079 align:start position:0%
implied
 
01:01:00.650 --> 01:01:00.660 align:start position:0%
uh who were not accurate and so I want
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
to make sure that um that you all have
 
01:01:04.970 --> 01:01:04.980 align:start position:0%
heard that
 
01:01:07.490 --> 01:01:07.500 align:start position:0%
I think one of the things I need to do
 
01:01:10.910 --> 01:01:10.920 align:start position:0%
is to tell you a little bit about who I
 
01:01:13.789 --> 01:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
am and my motivations for this bill I
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm a I'm a 33 and a third year that's a
 
01:01:21.890 --> 01:01:21.900 align:start position:0%
a third of a century as an Army Medical
 
01:01:24.130 --> 01:01:24.140 align:start position:0%
Services Corps officer
 
01:01:28.069 --> 01:01:28.079 align:start position:0%
my job for those years decades was to
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
conserve the fighting strength I did a
 
01:01:33.650 --> 01:01:33.660 align:start position:0%
lot of operations planning I did a lot
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
of budget and Manpower work I did a lot
 
01:01:39.230 --> 01:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
of I.T work I sort of did a lot of
 
01:01:43.130 --> 01:01:43.140 align:start position:0%
things but in all of it my job was to
 
01:01:44.870 --> 01:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
conserve the fighting strength figure
 
01:01:47.690 --> 01:01:47.700 align:start position:0%
out what we could do to make our
 
01:01:50.150 --> 01:01:50.160 align:start position:0%
operations as lean and mean and as
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
effective as possible and so when I
 
01:01:55.609 --> 01:01:55.619 align:start position:0%
returned retired from the military and
 
01:01:58.569 --> 01:01:58.579 align:start position:0%
from my job as a medical device
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
manufacturer program manager I came to
 
01:02:05.809 --> 01:02:05.819 align:start position:0%
the house with that same training and
 
01:02:09.410 --> 01:02:09.420 align:start position:0%
experience and motivation that I just
 
01:02:11.870 --> 01:02:11.880 align:start position:0%
want things to work better
 
01:02:14.569 --> 01:02:14.579 align:start position:0%
um I'm not a tool of the industry
 
01:02:18.589 --> 01:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
uh despite any implications I'm not
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
submitting this for the industry I'm
 
01:02:23.270 --> 01:02:23.280 align:start position:0%
submitting this for the citizens of
 
01:02:26.390 --> 01:02:26.400 align:start position:0%
Auburn candy at Chester and Deerfield so
 
01:02:29.450 --> 01:02:29.460 align:start position:0%
that when the state if the state starts
 
01:02:32.210 --> 01:02:32.220 align:start position:0%
to issue new tax bills we've done our
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
due diligence to me this is about due
 
01:02:36.789 --> 01:02:36.799 align:start position:0%
diligence as a business process
 
01:02:40.670 --> 01:02:40.680 align:start position:0%
re-engineering subject matter expert I
 
01:02:43.309 --> 01:02:43.319 align:start position:0%
have had experience taking a look at
 
01:02:43.319 --> 01:02:44.589 align:start position:0%
have had experience taking a look at
multiple

01:02:44.589 --> 01:02:44.599 align:start position:0%
multiple
 
01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
processes and systems and trying to work
 
01:02:51.230 --> 01:02:51.240 align:start position:0%
with others to rationalize the best way
 
01:02:54.910 --> 01:02:54.920 align:start position:0%
to get things done and I see
 
01:02:57.650 --> 01:02:57.660 align:start position:0%
this prescription drug affordability
 
01:03:01.150 --> 01:03:01.160 align:start position:0%
board as an opportunity for us to do
 
01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:05.220 align:start position:0%
some analysis to make sure that we
 
01:03:07.130 --> 01:03:07.140 align:start position:0%
accomplish the objective which is to
 
01:03:08.870 --> 01:03:08.880 align:start position:0%
create an environment where we can use
 
01:03:11.210 --> 01:03:11.220 align:start position:0%
information power to put pressure
 
01:03:14.870 --> 01:03:14.880 align:start position:0%
downward pressure on drug prices we all
 
01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:16.799 align:start position:0%
agree on the intent
 
01:03:19.370 --> 01:03:19.380 align:start position:0%
we all agree on the intent we all agree
 
01:03:22.309 --> 01:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
on the intent we we just see a different
 
01:03:24.470 --> 01:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
way of getting there this is a
 
01:03:27.589 --> 01:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
bipartisan bill I'll note you know that
 
01:03:30.289 --> 01:03:30.299 align:start position:0%
bipartisan doesn't mean unanimous
 
01:03:30.299 --> 01:03:31.549 align:start position:0%
bipartisan doesn't mean unanimous
so

01:03:31.549 --> 01:03:31.559 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:03:34.130 --> 01:03:34.140 align:start position:0%
um so this is not a unanimous view but
 
01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
it's certainly a bipartisan view that we
 
01:03:38.809 --> 01:03:38.819 align:start position:0%
we might be able to do this better and
 
01:03:41.089 --> 01:03:41.099 align:start position:0%
in your testimony last week you heard
 
01:03:44.950 --> 01:03:44.960 align:start position:0%
essentially one of the witnesses say
 
01:03:48.049 --> 01:03:48.059 align:start position:0%
that there is no redundancy
 
01:03:50.510 --> 01:03:50.520 align:start position:0%
because no one has this mission
 
01:03:52.490 --> 01:03:52.500 align:start position:0%
but if you go back and you listen to
 
01:03:55.130 --> 01:03:55.140 align:start position:0%
what representative leishman and I were
 
01:03:57.710 --> 01:03:57.720 align:start position:0%
saying is that there is some level of
 
01:03:59.329 --> 01:03:59.339 align:start position:0%
redundancy there's some level of
 
01:04:01.010 --> 01:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
redundancy in the way the fees are
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
assessed there's some level of
 
01:04:04.130 --> 01:04:04.140 align:start position:0%
redundancy around the way the data is
 
01:04:06.410 --> 01:04:06.420 align:start position:0%
collected there's some redundancy around
 
01:04:09.890 --> 01:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
the reporting it it's it's not a
 
01:04:09.900 --> 01:04:11.150 align:start position:0%
the reporting it it's it's not a
complete

01:04:11.150 --> 01:04:11.160 align:start position:0%
complete
 
01:04:14.450 --> 01:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
synchronization of a Venn diagram but on
 
01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:16.380 align:start position:0%
a Venn diagram there's a whole lot of
 
01:04:18.410 --> 01:04:18.420 align:start position:0%
overlap that just needs to be
 
01:04:22.849 --> 01:04:22.859 align:start position:0%
deconflicted and rationalized and so so
 
01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:25.140 align:start position:0%
when you hear there is no redundancy
 
01:04:29.210 --> 01:04:29.220 align:start position:0%
because the mission is unique that's not
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
the point the the point is that we want
 
01:04:33.530 --> 01:04:33.540 align:start position:0%
to accomplish the mission but we want to
 
01:04:35.630 --> 01:04:35.640 align:start position:0%
do it efficiently and effectively and
 
01:04:37.789 --> 01:04:37.799 align:start position:0%
there's current redundancy now that's uh
 
01:04:40.670 --> 01:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
that bearish look being looked at
 
01:04:44.510 --> 01:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
we also said that this bill
 
01:04:48.289 --> 01:04:48.299 align:start position:0%
is uh not the bill rather but um the
 
01:04:52.190 --> 01:04:52.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:54.890 --> 01:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
was first passed as part of a Christmas
 
01:04:57.530 --> 01:04:57.540 align:start position:0%
tree Omnibus kind of piece of
 
01:05:00.069 --> 01:05:00.079 align:start position:0%
legislation that is a true statement
 
01:05:03.770 --> 01:05:03.780 align:start position:0%
okay what was also said by
 
01:05:06.470 --> 01:05:06.480 align:start position:0%
representative leishman and myself is
 
01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.730 align:start position:0%
representative leishman and myself is
that

01:05:07.730 --> 01:05:07.740 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:05:10.130 --> 01:05:10.140 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug affordability
 
01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:11.329 align:start position:0%
the prescription drug affordability
board

01:05:11.329 --> 01:05:11.339 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:05:14.030 --> 01:05:14.040 align:start position:0%
never went through a normal house
 
01:05:17.390 --> 01:05:17.400 align:start position:0%
process it did it did not go to ways and
 
01:05:19.670 --> 01:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
means to look at the the tax
 
01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:21.289 align:start position:0%
means to look at the the tax
implications

01:05:21.289 --> 01:05:21.299 align:start position:0%
implications
 
01:05:23.950 --> 01:05:23.960 align:start position:0%
the the the the the
 
01:05:27.230 --> 01:05:27.240 align:start position:0%
proponents of the board prefer to call
 
01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:29.940 align:start position:0%
it a fee assessment I I think if the
 
01:05:32.150 --> 01:05:32.160 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee heard it as a
 
01:05:33.650 --> 01:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
former member of the Ways and Means
 
01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
Committee I think many of them most of
 
01:05:38.270 --> 01:05:38.280 align:start position:0%
them would think that it's a tax not a
 
01:05:40.910 --> 01:05:40.920 align:start position:0%
fee and but the ways and means has never
 
01:05:43.370 --> 01:05:43.380 align:start position:0%
been afforded an opportunity to look at
 
01:05:45.890 --> 01:05:45.900 align:start position:0%
the affordability board
 
01:05:48.410 --> 01:05:48.420 align:start position:0%
um also division three which I know a
 
01:05:50.329 --> 01:05:50.339 align:start position:0%
little bit about is the current chair
 
01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:53.760 align:start position:0%
and the chair from last term uh never
 
01:05:57.710 --> 01:05:57.720 align:start position:0%
saw this bill so so on one hand Ways and
 
01:05:59.150 --> 01:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
Means didn't look at the revenues
 
01:06:01.309 --> 01:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
division three didn't look at the
 
01:06:05.210 --> 01:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
expenses and so when we say to you that
 
01:06:08.450 --> 01:06:08.460 align:start position:0%
that the drug affordability board never
 
01:06:10.970 --> 01:06:10.980 align:start position:0%
went through the ordinary house process
 
01:06:14.270 --> 01:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
that is literally a true statement and
 
01:06:17.589 --> 01:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
to say otherwise I think
 
01:06:19.670 --> 01:06:19.680 align:start position:0%
obfuscates out
 
01:06:23.030 --> 01:06:23.040 align:start position:0%
so so Mr chair if I if I could I I'd
 
01:06:25.609 --> 01:06:25.619 align:start position:0%
like just a couple more minutes
 
01:06:27.589 --> 01:06:27.599 align:start position:0%
um it's just your discretion I think I
 
01:06:29.390 --> 01:06:29.400 align:start position:0%
told you six minutes and it feels like
 
01:06:31.970 --> 01:06:31.980 align:start position:0%
I'm approaching six minutes
 
01:06:34.970 --> 01:06:34.980 align:start position:0%
um so I want to give you some some real
 
01:06:37.609 --> 01:06:37.619 align:start position:0%
world examples of where we have some
 
01:06:41.089 --> 01:06:41.099 align:start position:0%
redundancies and I can forward this
 
01:06:43.970 --> 01:06:43.980 align:start position:0%
document to you later but this is to
 
01:06:45.410 --> 01:06:45.420 align:start position:0%
substantiate that there are some
 
01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:46.609 align:start position:0%
substantiate that there are some
redundancies

01:06:46.609 --> 01:06:46.619 align:start position:0%
redundancies
 
01:06:52.430 --> 01:06:52.440 align:start position:0%
if you look at RSA 420 golf colon 11a
 
01:06:56.750 --> 01:06:56.760 align:start position:0%
uh what that does is it establishes a
 
01:06:58.370 --> 01:06:58.380 align:start position:0%
statute for the New Hampshire
 
01:07:01.150 --> 01:07:01.160 align:start position:0%
Comprehensive Health Information System
 
01:07:05.690 --> 01:07:05.700 align:start position:0%
as being an all-payer claims database so
 
01:07:07.789 --> 01:07:07.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of the data that the affordability
 
01:07:10.970 --> 01:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
board would like to look at
 
01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:14.640 align:start position:0%
already resides to some extent in an
 
01:07:17.630 --> 01:07:17.640 align:start position:0%
existing database that was chartered and
 
01:07:19.490 --> 01:07:19.500 align:start position:0%
already in statute
 
01:07:23.750 --> 01:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
then we have an existing health care
 
01:07:27.890 --> 01:07:27.900 align:start position:0%
cost website that the the Deputy
 
01:07:30.730 --> 01:07:30.740 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of Insurance
 
01:07:33.829 --> 01:07:33.839 align:start position:0%
Mr Bettencourt testified to last time
 
01:07:36.170 --> 01:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
said it was it was temporarily available
 
01:07:38.630 --> 01:07:38.640 align:start position:0%
but that there is a New Hampshire
 
01:07:40.970 --> 01:07:40.980 align:start position:0%
prescription drug pricing on that
 
01:07:44.690 --> 01:07:44.700 align:start position:0%
website and and and much of what the
 
01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:47.280 align:start position:0%
magic of the drug affordability board is
 
01:07:50.210 --> 01:07:50.220 align:start position:0%
intended to be if you assume that their
 
01:07:52.309 --> 01:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
theory is correct they'll be able to
 
01:07:54.650 --> 01:07:54.660 align:start position:0%
create a very powerful piece of
 
01:07:56.890 --> 01:07:56.900 align:start position:0%
reporting and information that's unique
 
01:08:01.370 --> 01:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
that will give people who already have
 
01:08:03.589 --> 01:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
an incentive to reduce prices yet more
 
01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:06.960 align:start position:0%
incentive to reduce prices so so we have
 
01:08:09.609 --> 01:08:09.619 align:start position:0%
some of that reporting already
 
01:08:13.849 --> 01:08:13.859 align:start position:0%
we we also have an annual report from
 
01:08:16.870 --> 01:08:16.880 align:start position:0%
the health insurance on cost drivers
 
01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:19.380 align:start position:0%
and that's been annual like I'm going to
 
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
afford this document to you later but
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
it's um it it it's got some specifics in
 
01:08:27.769 --> 01:08:27.779 align:start position:0%
there where you could look it up
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
and then
 
01:08:33.590 --> 01:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
we have a statute that requires it's RSA
 
01:08:37.550 --> 01:08:37.560 align:start position:0%
318 colon 68 the high cost prescription
 
01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:39.900 align:start position:0%
drug data so if there's a new drug
 
01:08:42.650 --> 01:08:42.660 align:start position:0%
that's introduced that's defined to be
 
01:08:43.870 --> 01:08:43.880 align:start position:0%
high cost
 
01:08:46.610 --> 01:08:46.620 align:start position:0%
we require reporting on it and then
 
01:08:48.530 --> 01:08:48.540 align:start position:0%
there's there's transparency to the
 
01:08:48.540 --> 01:08:49.309 align:start position:0%
there's there's transparency to the
public

01:08:49.309 --> 01:08:49.319 align:start position:0%
public
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
and then finally in terms of what are we
 
01:08:56.269 --> 01:08:56.279 align:start position:0%
doing at the state level to try to
 
01:08:58.809 --> 01:08:58.819 align:start position:0%
reduce prices
 
01:09:03.950 --> 01:09:03.960 align:start position:0%
the Mr arlinghaus over the Das has
 
01:09:06.010 --> 01:09:06.020 align:start position:0%
reverse PBM
 
01:09:09.229 --> 01:09:09.239 align:start position:0%
auctions and there's a website I can
 
01:09:12.050 --> 01:09:12.060 align:start position:0%
I'll share with you on that but it's but
 
01:09:14.570 --> 01:09:14.580 align:start position:0%
the note I have here is that the Das is
 
01:09:17.570 --> 01:09:17.580 align:start position:0%
currently conducts a reverse PBM auction
 
01:09:20.570 --> 01:09:20.580 align:start position:0%
process for prescription benefits
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
provided to State Employees and retirees
 
01:09:25.970 --> 01:09:25.980 align:start position:0%
according to das this is competitive
 
01:09:29.090 --> 01:09:29.100 align:start position:0%
Marketplace Marketplace is helping to
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
hold the line on prescription drug
 
01:09:34.130 --> 01:09:34.140 align:start position:0%
prices for the population so at the
 
01:09:36.530 --> 01:09:36.540 align:start position:0%
state level I just I just read five
 
01:09:38.870 --> 01:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
areas specifically where there's some
 
01:09:41.030 --> 01:09:41.040 align:start position:0%
redundancy I didn't even get into the
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
federal areas because the federal
 
01:09:44.450 --> 01:09:44.460 align:start position:0%
government has been trying to wrap their
 
01:09:47.749 --> 01:09:47.759 align:start position:0%
hands on this for a while now and hasn't
 
01:09:50.209 --> 01:09:50.219 align:start position:0%
been any more successful and as much as
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
I respect the individuals on the New
 
01:09:53.510 --> 01:09:53.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire prescription drug
 
01:09:56.390 --> 01:09:56.400 align:start position:0%
affordability board they are very
 
01:10:00.290 --> 01:10:00.300 align:start position:0%
willing to take on a a task that has
 
01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:02.040 align:start position:0%
failed the federal government in Maine
 
01:10:05.050 --> 01:10:05.060 align:start position:0%
so far that have more resources
 
01:10:08.570 --> 01:10:08.580 align:start position:0%
moreheads start and and I would like to
 
01:10:10.250 --> 01:10:10.260 align:start position:0%
believe that New Hampshire is just so
 
01:10:13.490 --> 01:10:13.500 align:start position:0%
great we could accomplish their goal but
 
01:10:16.669 --> 01:10:16.679 align:start position:0%
there's there's scant reason beyond
 
01:10:19.070 --> 01:10:19.080 align:start position:0%
belief in those individuals that it will
 
01:10:21.590 --> 01:10:21.600 align:start position:0%
get done we heard testimony last time
 
01:10:24.110 --> 01:10:24.120 align:start position:0%
that the paragraph that tells them what
 
01:10:25.310 --> 01:10:25.320 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to do is so
 
01:10:27.530 --> 01:10:27.540 align:start position:0%
incomprehensible that it became the
 
01:10:29.810 --> 01:10:29.820 align:start position:0%
subject matter of a joke in the pbap
 
01:10:32.450 --> 01:10:32.460 align:start position:0%
meeting and and although the joke was
 
01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:35.280 align:start position:0%
offensive to the person who told it it
 
01:10:38.930 --> 01:10:38.940 align:start position:0%
was nevertheless true that the the the
 
01:10:42.229 --> 01:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
the requirements of the report are are
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
so convoluted that it it it's probably
 
01:10:47.450 --> 01:10:47.460 align:start position:0%
going to take years of analysis to even
 
01:10:49.189 --> 01:10:49.199 align:start position:0%
figure out what it means
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
so so I would ask you to consider House
 
01:10:56.810 --> 01:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
Bill 130 while you consider House Bill
 
01:11:00.950 --> 01:11:00.960 align:start position:0%
172 one is just shut it down and let's
 
01:11:03.470 --> 01:11:03.480 align:start position:0%
take a fresh look at this the other was
 
01:11:07.250 --> 01:11:07.260 align:start position:0%
you know and our our attempt to be
 
01:11:09.229 --> 01:11:09.239 align:start position:0%
reasonable and say hey let's just have a
 
01:11:11.209 --> 01:11:11.219 align:start position:0%
good thorough discussion let's do the
 
01:11:13.550 --> 01:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
right thing before we go plunging into
 
01:11:16.850 --> 01:11:16.860 align:start position:0%
this and um I I think whatever wherever
 
01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:18.780 align:start position:0%
the committee goes between that range of
 
01:11:21.229 --> 01:11:21.239 align:start position:0%
two things I'm perfectly fine with I'm
 
01:11:23.030 --> 01:11:23.040 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions that you
 
01:11:26.209 --> 01:11:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:28.010 --> 01:11:28.020 align:start position:0%
great do we have questions yeah
 
01:11:29.990 --> 01:11:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative Sullivan
 
01:11:31.550 --> 01:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I actually have
 
01:11:32.689 --> 01:11:32.699 align:start position:0%
two questions
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
one is just sort of a definitional thing
 
01:11:37.070 --> 01:11:37.080 align:start position:0%
that I as a resident of New Hampshire
 
01:11:39.649 --> 01:11:39.659 align:start position:0%
don't understand myself which is what is
 
01:11:41.270 --> 01:11:41.280 align:start position:0%
the definition of a fee versus tax
 
01:11:42.410 --> 01:11:42.420 align:start position:0%
you're saying they're calling it a fee
 
01:11:43.790 --> 01:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
but it's really a tax so what would be
 
01:11:46.250 --> 01:11:46.260 align:start position:0%
like the the difference
 
01:11:48.590 --> 01:11:48.600 align:start position:0%
so would you believe there actually is a
 
01:11:50.570 --> 01:11:50.580 align:start position:0%
definitional distinction and that the
 
01:11:52.250 --> 01:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
people in the ways and means deal with
 
01:11:54.590 --> 01:11:54.600 align:start position:0%
that definition all the time I have it
 
01:11:57.530 --> 01:11:57.540 align:start position:0%
somewhere in my email but so so without
 
01:11:59.630 --> 01:11:59.640 align:start position:0%
being precise if they'll allow me to
 
01:12:00.729 --> 01:12:00.739 align:start position:0%
tell you
 
01:12:03.649 --> 01:12:03.659 align:start position:0%
generically what what the distinction is
 
01:12:08.689 --> 01:12:08.699 align:start position:0%
is that is that when we pay a fee
 
01:12:13.850 --> 01:12:13.860 align:start position:0%
the idea is that we are paying money to
 
01:12:17.689 --> 01:12:17.699 align:start position:0%
help provide a government service in a
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
way that's relatively direct so that we
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
receive the benefit of that government
 
01:12:26.050 --> 01:12:26.060 align:start position:0%
service so there's a a direct connection
 
01:12:29.990 --> 01:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
between our payment of the money and the
 
01:12:32.030 --> 01:12:32.040 align:start position:0%
resourcing of the government to be able
 
01:12:34.490 --> 01:12:34.500 align:start position:0%
to to provide an environment or provide
 
01:12:38.510 --> 01:12:38.520 align:start position:0%
the specific purpose or or goals to us
 
01:12:41.990 --> 01:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
I'll give you as an example a marriage
 
01:12:44.510 --> 01:12:44.520 align:start position:0%
license when you go and buy a marriage
 
01:12:46.669 --> 01:12:46.679 align:start position:0%
license you're paying a marriage license
 
01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
fee well you you could call that a tax
 
01:12:52.550 --> 01:12:52.560 align:start position:0%
but we don't we call that a fee because
 
01:12:55.610 --> 01:12:55.620 align:start position:0%
you're paying for the right to have your
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
your civil union recognized by the state
 
01:13:00.229 --> 01:13:00.239 align:start position:0%
and to receive all the legal benefits of
 
01:13:03.229 --> 01:13:03.239 align:start position:0%
marriage so that's a fee what's a tax
 
01:13:07.729 --> 01:13:07.739 align:start position:0%
well a tax is the government
 
01:13:11.090 --> 01:13:11.100 align:start position:0%
taking money to support General
 
01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.140 align:start position:0%
operations that do not have a direct
 
01:13:19.390 --> 01:13:19.400 align:start position:0%
benefit to the taxpayer
 
01:13:22.970 --> 01:13:22.980 align:start position:0%
it's more of an indirect benefit like
 
01:13:24.770 --> 01:13:24.780 align:start position:0%
for example
 
01:13:29.270 --> 01:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
um we we pay taxes that go into the
 
01:13:32.870 --> 01:13:32.880 align:start position:0%
highway trust fund and uh and that's
 
01:13:36.649 --> 01:13:36.659 align:start position:0%
that's a tax because it it's going to
 
01:13:39.050 --> 01:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
pay for the overall maintenance of the
 
01:13:41.689 --> 01:13:41.699 align:start position:0%
road and although we get the benefit of
 
01:13:43.790 --> 01:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
the environment we're not getting a
 
01:13:45.229 --> 01:13:45.239 align:start position:0%
direct benefit
 
01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:47.699 align:start position:0%
a toll on the other hand would be more
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
like a fee I understand uh for the
 
01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:51.960 align:start position:0%
question for the question may inquire
 
01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:54.900 align:start position:0%
okay and then so just on the redundancy
 
01:13:56.390 --> 01:13:56.400 align:start position:0%
you you listed like I think you said
 
01:13:58.430 --> 01:13:58.440 align:start position:0%
five different areas where there's three
 
01:13:59.330 --> 01:13:59.340 align:start position:0%
different areas where there's some
 
01:14:01.910 --> 01:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
redundancy I'm just kind of curious I'm
 
01:14:03.290 --> 01:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
kind of thinking of it in the model of
 
01:14:05.330 --> 01:14:05.340 align:start position:0%
like say maybe a general contractor does
 
01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:07.920 align:start position:0%
it make sense to have maybe this board I
 
01:14:09.050 --> 01:14:09.060 align:start position:0%
don't know anything about this I'm truly
 
01:14:10.430 --> 01:14:10.440 align:start position:0%
just asking I don't have an opinion at
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
this point but what happens if you have
 
01:14:14.689 --> 01:14:14.699 align:start position:0%
a general contractor building a house
 
01:14:16.790 --> 01:14:16.800 align:start position:0%
you have them sort of managing plumbers
 
01:14:18.890 --> 01:14:18.900 align:start position:0%
electricians Carpenters could it be kind
 
01:14:20.149 --> 01:14:20.159 align:start position:0%
of like that where everything's in-house
 
01:14:21.470 --> 01:14:21.480 align:start position:0%
and it's just more efficient
 
01:14:23.810 --> 01:14:23.820 align:start position:0%
organization that way versus one person
 
01:14:25.729 --> 01:14:25.739 align:start position:0%
doing one little bit of this redundancy
 
01:14:27.709 --> 01:14:27.719 align:start position:0%
another person do another thing in which
 
01:14:28.970 --> 01:14:28.980 align:start position:0%
case maybe it's actually a less
 
01:14:31.130 --> 01:14:31.140 align:start position:0%
efficient way to get the desired outcome
 
01:14:33.229 --> 01:14:33.239 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you for the question and
 
01:14:36.470 --> 01:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
and my first general answer is yes it
 
01:14:39.590 --> 01:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
could be that way but that is a
 
01:14:42.470 --> 01:14:42.480 align:start position:0%
different answer than what is it now the
 
01:14:45.050 --> 01:14:45.060 align:start position:0%
the P the prescription drug
 
01:14:47.630 --> 01:14:47.640 align:start position:0%
affordability board as constituted in
 
01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
law is really a stove pipe that isn't
 
01:14:54.950 --> 01:14:54.960 align:start position:0%
integrated with other aspects of these
 
01:14:56.930 --> 01:14:56.940 align:start position:0%
tasks that we're doing and oh you're
 
01:14:58.850 --> 01:14:58.860 align:start position:0%
right there were five of them there were
 
01:15:00.290 --> 01:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
three bullets but there were five
 
01:15:02.630 --> 01:15:02.640 align:start position:0%
specifics so you were right but but
 
01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.130 align:start position:0%
specifics so you were right but but
anyways

01:15:04.130 --> 01:15:04.140 align:start position:0%
anyways
 
01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:05.450 align:start position:0%
anyways
um

01:15:05.450 --> 01:15:05.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:07.610 --> 01:15:07.620 align:start position:0%
they're not chartered to be that
 
01:15:09.229 --> 01:15:09.239 align:start position:0%
integration function they're chartered
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
to do a stove pipe function and in doing
 
01:15:13.610 --> 01:15:13.620 align:start position:0%
the stovepipe function they're
 
01:15:16.010 --> 01:15:16.020 align:start position:0%
replicating some activities that are
 
01:15:18.290 --> 01:15:18.300 align:start position:0%
already being done elsewhere in statute
 
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
and and so that's where a small group of
 
01:15:24.830 --> 01:15:24.840 align:start position:0%
you know experienced people uh could get
 
01:15:27.290 --> 01:15:27.300 align:start position:0%
together in a few workshops really pound
 
01:15:31.010 --> 01:15:31.020 align:start position:0%
out you know a more of a game plan on on
 
01:15:31.020 --> 01:15:31.750 align:start position:0%
out you know a more of a game plan on on
on

01:15:31.750 --> 01:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:15:34.370 --> 01:15:34.380 align:start position:0%
what already exists and how it could be
 
01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.169 align:start position:0%
what already exists and how it could be
leveraged

01:15:36.169 --> 01:15:36.179 align:start position:0%
leveraged
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
um I I've I've spent maybe five hours on
 
01:15:43.130 --> 01:15:43.140 align:start position:0%
it and I I think I have some ideas but
 
01:15:45.709 --> 01:15:45.719 align:start position:0%
that's no substitute for you know having
 
01:15:47.750 --> 01:15:47.760 align:start position:0%
the people who own the responsibility
 
01:15:50.270 --> 01:15:50.280 align:start position:0%
and the executive branch really really
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
look at it and figure out what's what's
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:57.229 --> 01:15:57.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative Terry yes
 
01:15:59.930 --> 01:15:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh you and
 
01:16:01.610 --> 01:16:01.620 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
brought us a bill last week where you
 
01:16:09.590 --> 01:16:09.600 align:start position:0%
were advocating for a pause this week
 
01:16:11.990 --> 01:16:12.000 align:start position:0%
we're dealing with the bill that where
 
01:16:14.810 --> 01:16:14.820 align:start position:0%
you're advocating for for termination
 
01:16:17.990 --> 01:16:18.000 align:start position:0%
if in fact you and your colleague
 
01:16:20.330 --> 01:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
believe that the the board should be
 
01:16:22.790 --> 01:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
terminated then what is the rationale
 
01:16:25.010 --> 01:16:25.020 align:start position:0%
for bringing us a bill
 
01:16:28.189 --> 01:16:28.199 align:start position:0%
to pause rather than to terminate
 
01:16:32.209 --> 01:16:32.219 align:start position:0%
is it political so no
 
01:16:35.090 --> 01:16:35.100 align:start position:0%
well let me say with disdain no no no
 
01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:38.400 align:start position:0%
the the the issue is I'm not a member of
 
01:16:40.610 --> 01:16:40.620 align:start position:0%
the Commerce Committee excuse me I I
 
01:16:42.470 --> 01:16:42.480 align:start position:0%
don't have the experience that the
 
01:16:44.090 --> 01:16:44.100 align:start position:0%
membership of this Commerce Committee
 
01:16:46.610 --> 01:16:46.620 align:start position:0%
has what what I'm what I'm saying is
 
01:16:50.510 --> 01:16:50.520 align:start position:0%
we've identified a problem and we we
 
01:16:54.410 --> 01:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
need to fix this problem and to you the
 
01:16:56.570 --> 01:16:56.580 align:start position:0%
Commerce Committee I'm saying hey look
 
01:16:58.729 --> 01:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
there's there's a range of options here
 
01:17:00.950 --> 01:17:00.960 align:start position:0%
there's a range to just shut it down and
 
01:17:03.470 --> 01:17:03.480 align:start position:0%
try to get it right from from a fresh
 
01:17:06.709 --> 01:17:06.719 align:start position:0%
start and then there's the option of
 
01:17:09.410 --> 01:17:09.420 align:start position:0%
saying look let's let's have a
 
01:17:11.990 --> 01:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
methodical conversation that's
 
01:17:14.990 --> 01:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
disciplined by the statute so that we
 
01:17:17.870 --> 01:17:17.880 align:start position:0%
can have the investigation and come back
 
01:17:20.689 --> 01:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
with ideas on how to harmonize and
 
01:17:24.290 --> 01:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
synergize these activities and so it's
 
01:17:27.050 --> 01:17:27.060 align:start position:0%
really the once I submit the bills it's
 
01:17:29.209 --> 01:17:29.219 align:start position:0%
really at the pleasure of this committee
 
01:17:31.310 --> 01:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
what you want to do with it and I and I
 
01:17:32.930 --> 01:17:32.940 align:start position:0%
think I said in my earlier testimony
 
01:17:36.169 --> 01:17:36.179 align:start position:0%
today and and last week I'm giving you
 
01:17:39.229 --> 01:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
this these two ideas so that you have a
 
01:17:43.090 --> 01:17:43.100 align:start position:0%
range of options for you to exercise
 
01:17:46.550 --> 01:17:46.560 align:start position:0%
your legislative discretion and decide
 
01:17:49.130 --> 01:17:49.140 align:start position:0%
Paul for the question may inquire thank
 
01:17:49.140 --> 01:17:50.090 align:start position:0%
Paul for the question may inquire thank
you

01:17:50.090 --> 01:17:50.100 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:17:52.970 --> 01:17:52.980 align:start position:0%
first I did not I mean to suggest and I
 
01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:54.179 align:start position:0%
hope that you did not miss the
 
01:17:56.810 --> 01:17:56.820 align:start position:0%
understand uh that by using the word
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
political I meant something nefarious I
 
01:18:02.090 --> 01:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
was speaking to the the matter of which
 
01:18:04.850 --> 01:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
one perhaps was more feasible in your
 
01:18:08.330 --> 01:18:08.340 align:start position:0%
view and and that of your co-sponsor but
 
01:18:11.350 --> 01:18:11.360 align:start position:0%
uh that now having been clarified I hope
 
01:18:14.689 --> 01:18:14.699 align:start position:0%
uh let me ask you uh if given your
 
01:18:18.169 --> 01:18:18.179 align:start position:0%
druthers which of the two do you and
 
01:18:20.270 --> 01:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
your colleague if you are able to speak
 
01:18:23.990 --> 01:18:24.000 align:start position:0%
for him do you uh prefer
 
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
um which would I prefer between the two
 
01:18:29.090 --> 01:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
I would prefer never to use the word
 
01:18:31.130 --> 01:18:31.140 align:start position:0%
political because I considered a dirty
 
01:18:34.250 --> 01:18:34.260 align:start position:0%
term you know I I'm talking about policy
 
01:18:36.830 --> 01:18:36.840 align:start position:0%
options that's where I'm at but between
 
01:18:41.090 --> 01:18:41.100 align:start position:0%
the two bills uh I I I was I was feeling
 
01:18:43.790 --> 01:18:43.800 align:start position:0%
really good about 172 until I heard
 
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
subsequent testimony kind of got me
 
01:18:48.830 --> 01:18:48.840 align:start position:0%
angry and you know as you've seen a
 
01:18:51.590 --> 01:18:51.600 align:start position:0%
little hint of that you know uh and I
 
01:18:54.110 --> 01:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
just burn it down kill it you know but
 
01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:56.520 align:start position:0%
but that's my emotional reaction
 
01:18:59.930 --> 01:18:59.940 align:start position:0%
what you guys do your seasoned mature
 
01:19:01.250 --> 01:19:01.260 align:start position:0%
group of people you're going to figure
 
01:19:02.930 --> 01:19:02.940 align:start position:0%
out which is the best of these two
 
01:19:06.410 --> 01:19:06.420 align:start position:0%
Alternatives I think I I it was said in
 
01:19:09.649 --> 01:19:09.659 align:start position:0%
testimony by others last week that there
 
01:19:12.470 --> 01:19:12.480 align:start position:0%
had been discussions on this
 
01:19:14.630 --> 01:19:14.640 align:start position:0%
as though those discussions Were Meant
 
01:19:16.669 --> 01:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
to resolve all the differences what the
 
01:19:18.770 --> 01:19:18.780 align:start position:0%
discussions did was highlight
 
01:19:20.870 --> 01:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
fundamental differences between the
 
01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:23.580 align:start position:0%
members of the current prescription drug
 
01:19:26.750 --> 01:19:26.760 align:start position:0%
affordability board and what I think is
 
01:19:31.669 --> 01:19:31.679 align:start position:0%
a more widespread holistic view of the
 
01:19:35.209 --> 01:19:35.219 align:start position:0%
state as a system of systems and and and
 
01:19:38.270 --> 01:19:38.280 align:start position:0%
we weren't going to resolve that
 
01:19:41.630 --> 01:19:41.640 align:start position:0%
difference in discussions so this is how
 
01:19:43.850 --> 01:19:43.860 align:start position:0%
we do things we bring you policy options
 
01:19:47.510 --> 01:19:47.520 align:start position:0%
give you testimony and rely on you to
 
01:19:50.390 --> 01:19:50.400 align:start position:0%
you know be the smart people great thank
 
01:19:53.450 --> 01:19:53.460 align:start position:0%
you yes sir okay so uh representative
 
01:19:55.390 --> 01:19:55.400 align:start position:0%
Gibbs thank you
 
01:19:59.149 --> 01:19:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh representative Edwards um
 
01:20:00.830 --> 01:20:00.840 align:start position:0%
you mentioned
 
01:20:03.470 --> 01:20:03.480 align:start position:0%
um uh you listed actually a number of
 
01:20:08.570 --> 01:20:08.580 align:start position:0%
items um that are already ongoing uh in
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
currently existing uh New Hampshire
 
01:20:14.209 --> 01:20:14.219 align:start position:0%
agencies and under currently existing uh
 
01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:17.460 align:start position:0%
law other than the uh this this board
 
01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
and the law that established it
 
01:20:24.410 --> 01:20:24.420 align:start position:0%
um you haven't said uh that everything
 
01:20:28.130 --> 01:20:28.140 align:start position:0%
that the board uh proposes to do is
 
01:20:28.140 --> 01:20:30.169 align:start position:0%
that the board uh proposes to do is
redundant

01:20:30.169 --> 01:20:30.179 align:start position:0%
redundant
 
01:20:32.330 --> 01:20:32.340 align:start position:0%
um and also
 
01:20:34.250 --> 01:20:34.260 align:start position:0%
um uh
 
01:20:37.270 --> 01:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
you said that the board is established
 
01:20:41.030 --> 01:20:41.040 align:start position:0%
to act in a stovepipe function rather
 
01:20:43.729 --> 01:20:43.739 align:start position:0%
than collaborating with all these other
 
01:20:47.330 --> 01:20:47.340 align:start position:0%
agencies uh which I agree they they do
 
01:20:49.250 --> 01:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
exist and they they do their various
 
01:20:52.130 --> 01:20:52.140 align:start position:0%
functions uh but as I understood the
 
01:20:55.310 --> 01:20:55.320 align:start position:0%
testimony by the members of the board at
 
01:20:58.189 --> 01:20:58.199 align:start position:0%
the last Hearing in fact they are
 
01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:01.320 align:start position:0%
Consulting with those other agencies and
 
01:21:04.430 --> 01:21:04.440 align:start position:0%
they are working with them uh to obtain
 
01:21:06.709 --> 01:21:06.719 align:start position:0%
the information in the most efficient
 
01:21:06.719 --> 01:21:08.229 align:start position:0%
the information in the most efficient
manner

01:21:08.229 --> 01:21:08.239 align:start position:0%
manner
 
01:21:13.010 --> 01:21:13.020 align:start position:0%
so my question is uh isn't it worthwhile
 
01:21:16.790 --> 01:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
to have an agency that can pull all of
 
01:21:19.610 --> 01:21:19.620 align:start position:0%
this information together in an
 
01:21:23.350 --> 01:21:23.360 align:start position:0%
efficient manner so as to make the best
 
01:21:27.649 --> 01:21:27.659 align:start position:0%
recommendation to address the problems
 
01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
of the high cost of prescription drugs
 
01:21:33.229 --> 01:21:33.239 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire Public payers
 
01:21:36.070 --> 01:21:36.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:38.450 --> 01:21:38.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
um on on the issue of whether or not I
 
01:21:43.130 --> 01:21:43.140 align:start position:0%
was completing my testimony that there
 
01:21:44.810 --> 01:21:44.820 align:start position:0%
while I state that there are
 
01:21:48.050 --> 01:21:48.060 align:start position:0%
redundancies I also sent you an email to
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
the committee maybe two hours ago and in
 
01:21:52.610 --> 01:21:52.620 align:start position:0%
my write-up I specifically pointed out
 
01:21:56.330 --> 01:21:56.340 align:start position:0%
that there were unique aspects to the
 
01:21:58.430 --> 01:21:58.440 align:start position:0%
board as well
 
01:22:00.070 --> 01:22:00.080 align:start position:0%
um that
 
01:22:03.410 --> 01:22:03.420 align:start position:0%
should should still be in play but that
 
01:22:05.630 --> 01:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
but that what our objective ought to be
 
01:22:09.050 --> 01:22:09.060 align:start position:0%
is is uh to to identify those
 
01:22:11.450 --> 01:22:11.460 align:start position:0%
redundancies and and to try to eliminate
 
01:22:13.610 --> 01:22:13.620 align:start position:0%
them particularly when a new tax is
 
01:22:16.010 --> 01:22:16.020 align:start position:0%
involved so for all of you people who've
 
01:22:19.430 --> 01:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
been saying no taxes no new taxes this
 
01:22:21.709 --> 01:22:21.719 align:start position:0%
is this is kind of stepping on that
 
01:22:26.330 --> 01:22:26.340 align:start position:0%
um all right on the stove pipe issue I I
 
01:22:29.330 --> 01:22:29.340 align:start position:0%
would point out that in testimony the
 
01:22:32.590 --> 01:22:32.600 align:start position:0%
chair of the of the pdab
 
01:22:36.530 --> 01:22:36.540 align:start position:0%
essentially in quotes said there is no
 
01:22:39.470 --> 01:22:39.480 align:start position:0%
redundancy because the missions are
 
01:22:42.470 --> 01:22:42.480 align:start position:0%
different and I'm challenging that to
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
say there are in fact redundancies and
 
01:22:46.910 --> 01:22:46.920 align:start position:0%
if there's anyone who's been incomplete
 
01:22:50.270 --> 01:22:50.280 align:start position:0%
or inaccurate it's not me you know there
 
01:22:53.630 --> 01:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
are some redundancy and then and and
 
01:22:57.649 --> 01:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
then in your question you you say that
 
01:22:59.930 --> 01:22:59.940 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be great if if they would
 
01:23:02.149 --> 01:23:02.159 align:start position:0%
just look at all the information and
 
01:23:04.550 --> 01:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
come back with with a better way of
 
01:23:05.630 --> 01:23:05.640 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:23:07.970 --> 01:23:07.980 align:start position:0%
and so you're assuming that they'll look
 
01:23:09.890 --> 01:23:09.900 align:start position:0%
at all the information that's way beyond
 
01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:13.500 align:start position:0%
their statutory Authority and my
 
01:23:16.490 --> 01:23:16.500 align:start position:0%
experience with government is is when
 
01:23:18.950 --> 01:23:18.960 align:start position:0%
you any bureaucracy this happened at
 
01:23:21.169 --> 01:23:21.179 align:start position:0%
Phillips Medical Systems it happened you
 
01:23:23.810 --> 01:23:23.820 align:start position:0%
know in the Army just you know anywhere
 
01:23:27.490 --> 01:23:27.500 align:start position:0%
once you establish a new entity
 
01:23:30.410 --> 01:23:30.420 align:start position:0%
the first and foremost goal of that
 
01:23:33.709 --> 01:23:33.719 align:start position:0%
entity is to self-perpetuate and to grow
 
01:23:38.630 --> 01:23:38.640 align:start position:0%
so so asking that entity to then
 
01:23:41.689 --> 01:23:41.699 align:start position:0%
deconstruct itself if if that was the
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
smart thing to do and to delegate
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
Authority elsewhere
 
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
you know you're just asking a lot of a
 
01:23:50.030 --> 01:23:50.040 align:start position:0%
government entity we just they just
 
01:23:53.149 --> 01:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
don't people don't behave that way so so
 
01:23:55.070 --> 01:23:55.080 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm saying let's call a
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%
Timeout on that and let's put this other
 
01:23:59.630 --> 01:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
group together whose job is to look
 
01:24:02.090 --> 01:24:02.100 align:start position:0%
across the Departments and and figure
 
01:24:04.630 --> 01:24:04.640 align:start position:0%
out a systemic way to approach us
 
01:24:08.330 --> 01:24:08.340 align:start position:0%
follow-up question uh certainly thank
 
01:24:11.750 --> 01:24:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:16.550 --> 01:24:16.560 align:start position:0%
given the fact that this agency has been
 
01:24:19.610 --> 01:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
established for a really very short time
 
01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:23.040 align:start position:0%
and up until now has had neither funding
 
01:24:26.209 --> 01:24:26.219 align:start position:0%
nor staff doesn't it make sense to give
 
01:24:29.689 --> 01:24:29.699 align:start position:0%
it a chance to get some funding
 
01:24:31.130 --> 01:24:31.140 align:start position:0%
um which would not come out of the
 
01:24:34.450 --> 01:24:34.460 align:start position:0%
general fund but would come out rather
 
01:24:37.490 --> 01:24:37.500 align:start position:0%
from the prescription drug industry and
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
honestly I don't care whether you call
 
01:24:41.530 --> 01:24:41.540 align:start position:0%
it a fee or a tax
 
01:24:44.689 --> 01:24:44.699 align:start position:0%
but it would the agency in order to
 
01:24:47.149 --> 01:24:47.159 align:start position:0%
operate has to have some funding and it
 
01:24:49.430 --> 01:24:49.440 align:start position:0%
has to be able to hire some staff right
 
01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:51.420 align:start position:0%
now you have volunteers who are
 
01:24:53.390 --> 01:24:53.400 align:start position:0%
gathering this information as best they
 
01:24:56.030 --> 01:24:56.040 align:start position:0%
can and at least as I understood the
 
01:25:01.570 --> 01:25:01.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:04.750 --> 01:25:04.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I'm I'm uh
 
01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
you're going a little long yeah just
 
01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:10.260 align:start position:0%
your question is should there be funding
 
01:25:12.290 --> 01:25:12.300 align:start position:0%
no that's not my question okay my
 
01:25:14.390 --> 01:25:14.400 align:start position:0%
question is shouldn't the agency have a
 
01:25:16.610 --> 01:25:16.620 align:start position:0%
chance to proceed get the funding hire
 
01:25:18.709 --> 01:25:18.719 align:start position:0%
the staff and then decide whether
 
01:25:21.169 --> 01:25:21.179 align:start position:0%
they're doing their job when they can do
 
01:25:24.350 --> 01:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
their job since at present really they
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
really can't do it because they don't
 
01:25:27.950 --> 01:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
have funding and staff
 
01:25:30.890 --> 01:25:30.900 align:start position:0%
I I I think in your question there's
 
01:25:34.490 --> 01:25:34.500 align:start position:0%
sort of a a fair point in there
 
01:25:38.090 --> 01:25:38.100 align:start position:0%
um uh I I still end up with a different
 
01:25:41.390 --> 01:25:41.400 align:start position:0%
conclusion though uh and I I would say
 
01:25:43.189 --> 01:25:43.199 align:start position:0%
they've been in operation for two and a
 
01:25:47.330 --> 01:25:47.340 align:start position:0%
half years and in January of 22 maybe it
 
01:25:49.010 --> 01:25:49.020 align:start position:0%
was February
 
01:25:52.850 --> 01:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
um the uh the the board came to the
 
01:25:55.310 --> 01:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
Joint fiscal committee asking for
 
01:25:57.890 --> 01:25:57.900 align:start position:0%
funding and I don't know if you know
 
01:26:00.050 --> 01:26:00.060 align:start position:0%
what the fiscal committee does but we're
 
01:26:02.450 --> 01:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
in a habit of saying yes I think we say
 
01:26:08.030 --> 01:26:08.040 align:start position:0%
yes you know like 95 97 of the time I
 
01:26:09.590 --> 01:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
mean don't tell my constituents that
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
because that'll bug a bunch of them but
 
01:26:13.729 --> 01:26:13.739 align:start position:0%
but we we are we're predisposed to
 
01:26:16.910 --> 01:26:16.920 align:start position:0%
saying yes to to these things this is a
 
01:26:18.770 --> 01:26:18.780 align:start position:0%
unique time where we tabled it because
 
01:26:21.229 --> 01:26:21.239 align:start position:0%
we just thought it was premature and not
 
01:26:23.930 --> 01:26:23.940 align:start position:0%
cooked and instinctively you know that's
 
01:26:26.270 --> 01:26:26.280 align:start position:0%
when I started you know my ears perked
 
01:26:27.890 --> 01:26:27.900 align:start position:0%
up and I thought and represented
 
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
policemans as well that that there you
 
01:26:32.510 --> 01:26:32.520 align:start position:0%
know that there's some redundancy here
 
01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:34.560 align:start position:0%
let's let's make sure that we we get
 
01:26:37.610 --> 01:26:37.620 align:start position:0%
this right before we go forward and uh
 
01:26:39.410 --> 01:26:39.420 align:start position:0%
and I already mentioned that uh the
 
01:26:41.270 --> 01:26:41.280 align:start position:0%
first rule of thumb of any bureaucracy
 
01:26:44.689 --> 01:26:44.699 align:start position:0%
government or otherwise is to grow
 
01:26:48.229 --> 01:26:48.239 align:start position:0%
so uh so I don't think uh asking them to
 
01:26:50.870 --> 01:26:50.880 align:start position:0%
get started is going to do much than to
 
01:26:53.629 --> 01:26:53.639 align:start position:0%
give them the chance to grow
 
01:26:58.310 --> 01:26:58.320 align:start position:0%
great thank you we're all set
 
01:26:59.870 --> 01:26:59.880 align:start position:0%
I had two questions
 
01:27:03.470 --> 01:27:03.480 align:start position:0%
may I make one comment uh no no we do
 
01:27:05.390 --> 01:27:05.400 align:start position:0%
that in in the exact session we get to
 
01:27:07.970 --> 01:27:07.980 align:start position:0%
make comments
 
01:27:09.830 --> 01:27:09.840 align:start position:0%
and there will be a subcommittee you can
 
01:27:11.270 --> 01:27:11.280 align:start position:0%
make lots of comments
 
01:27:13.010 --> 01:27:13.020 align:start position:0%
um but I'm afraid this is a comment in
 
01:27:15.950 --> 01:27:15.960 align:start position:0%
reference to what the uh that is
 
01:27:18.709 --> 01:27:18.719 align:start position:0%
absolutely in particular to make
 
01:27:21.169 --> 01:27:21.179 align:start position:0%
comments upon a person who's testifying
 
01:27:24.410 --> 01:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
is totally inappropriate and it is not
 
01:27:27.770 --> 01:27:27.780 align:start position:0%
upon the person it doesn't matter
 
01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:30.840 align:start position:0%
it's just you're you're it has the
 
01:27:33.410 --> 01:27:33.420 align:start position:0%
feeling that you're hurt you're aiming
 
01:27:34.790 --> 01:27:34.800 align:start position:0%
it towards the person because you just
 
01:27:36.350 --> 01:27:36.360 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:27:37.729 --> 01:27:37.739 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
01:27:40.010 --> 01:27:40.020 align:start position:0%

if you if you want to talk to me about
 
01:27:46.610 --> 01:27:46.620 align:start position:0%
this offline I'm I'm happy to do it so

01:27:50.940 --> 01:27:52.310 align:start position:0%
chair calls on representative Gary
Merchant

01:27:52.310 --> 01:27:52.320 align:start position:0%
Merchant
 
01:28:08.330 --> 01:28:08.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:14.590 --> 01:28:14.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:18.410 --> 01:28:18.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair before I get into my
 
01:28:20.330 --> 01:28:20.340 align:start position:0%
testimony I'd like to be sure you have
 
01:28:21.950 --> 01:28:21.960 align:start position:0%
the documents in front of you there's
 
01:28:25.070 --> 01:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
one it's my written testimony
 
01:28:27.350 --> 01:28:27.360 align:start position:0%
there's another one talks about total
 
01:28:29.390 --> 01:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
gross expenditures which two lines that
 
01:28:32.090 --> 01:28:32.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.669 --> 01:28:34.679 align:start position:0%
third one is
 
01:28:36.890 --> 01:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
transparency and affordability by Ela
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
litty on
 
01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:40.610 align:start position:0%
litty on
gimlog

01:28:40.610 --> 01:28:40.620 align:start position:0%
gimlog
 
01:28:42.709 --> 01:28:42.719 align:start position:0%
the fourth one is the recommendations
 
01:28:45.950 --> 01:28:45.960 align:start position:0%
from the main board
 
01:28:49.189 --> 01:28:49.199 align:start position:0%
and the fifth one is the language in the
 
01:28:55.310 --> 01:28:55.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:57.480 align:start position:0%
do they want to have a copy of the
 
01:28:59.330 --> 01:28:59.340 align:start position:0%
statute language for the represent
 
01:29:03.890 --> 01:29:03.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:05.870 --> 01:29:05.880 align:start position:0%
if you have all the documents then I
 
01:29:08.030 --> 01:29:08.040 align:start position:0%
would like to proceed
 
01:29:10.970 --> 01:29:10.980 align:start position:0%
fair enough fair enough
 
01:29:13.370 --> 01:29:13.380 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
01:29:15.950 --> 01:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
the House congresson
 
01:29:17.689 --> 01:29:17.699 align:start position:0%
consumer affairs committee and members
 
01:29:18.950 --> 01:29:18.960 align:start position:0%
of the public
 
01:29:21.770 --> 01:29:21.780 align:start position:0%
for the record my name is Gary Merchant
 
01:29:23.870 --> 01:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
representing Sullivan County district 6
 
01:29:26.149 --> 01:29:26.159 align:start position:0%
which is Clairemont and Croydon
 
01:29:27.530 --> 01:29:27.540 align:start position:0%
I also chair the prescription drug
 
01:29:29.629 --> 01:29:29.639 align:start position:0%
affordability board
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
I come before you today to oppose House
 
01:29:38.510 --> 01:29:38.520 align:start position:0%
Bill 130. shall repeal RSA 126 BB
 
01:29:39.649 --> 01:29:39.659 align:start position:0%
which is the prescription drug
 
01:29:42.110 --> 01:29:42.120 align:start position:0%
affordability statute
 
01:29:44.270 --> 01:29:44.280 align:start position:0%
prior to serving
 
01:29:46.370 --> 01:29:46.380 align:start position:0%
in the state house I served on New
 
01:29:48.410 --> 01:29:48.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to board a pharmacy for 10
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
years the last two years as a board
 
01:29:51.120 --> 01:29:53.510 align:start position:0%
years the last two years as a board
president

01:29:53.510 --> 01:29:53.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:56.270 --> 01:29:56.280 align:start position:0%
during my 40 plus years as a pharmacist
 
01:29:58.490 --> 01:29:58.500 align:start position:0%
I spent my career
 
01:30:00.470 --> 01:30:00.480 align:start position:0%
trying to understand the black box and
 
01:30:01.910 --> 01:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
probably have a better understanding of
 
01:30:03.890 --> 01:30:03.900 align:start position:0%
most people in this room
 
01:30:06.770 --> 01:30:06.780 align:start position:0%
but it's complex it's convoluted
 
01:30:09.290 --> 01:30:09.300 align:start position:0%
it's not transparent it doesn't work the
 
01:30:13.729 --> 01:30:13.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:16.250 --> 01:30:16.260 align:start position:0%
I gave you a diagram yesterday the last
 
01:30:18.530 --> 01:30:18.540 align:start position:0%
time on House Bill 172 which deals with
 
01:30:20.570 --> 01:30:20.580 align:start position:0%
the pharmacy supply chain the movement
 
01:30:22.129 --> 01:30:22.139 align:start position:0%
of the product as well as movement of
 
01:30:23.209 --> 01:30:23.219 align:start position:0%
the dollar
 
01:30:25.370 --> 01:30:25.380 align:start position:0%
they're related
 
01:30:28.430 --> 01:30:28.440 align:start position:0%
but they don't follow each other
 
01:30:31.030 --> 01:30:31.040 align:start position:0%
your primary concern for the citizens
 
01:30:34.910 --> 01:30:34.920 align:start position:0%
especially those elderly
 
01:30:38.629 --> 01:30:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:43.370 --> 01:30:43.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:45.410 --> 01:30:45.420 align:start position:0%
many abandoned abandoned the drugs
 
01:30:47.030 --> 01:30:47.040 align:start position:0%
because they can't afford it which only
 
01:30:49.729 --> 01:30:49.739 align:start position:0%
leads to higher medical costs
 
01:30:51.410 --> 01:30:51.420 align:start position:0%
the first report I want you to look at
 
01:30:53.990 --> 01:30:54.000 align:start position:0%
which I think is fascinating this is
 
01:30:56.330 --> 01:30:56.340 align:start position:0%
coming from the Berkeley group the one
 
01:30:58.370 --> 01:30:58.380 align:start position:0%
with the two lines on it
 
01:31:01.070 --> 01:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
back in 2013
 
01:31:05.930 --> 01:31:05.940 align:start position:0%
Pharma claimed about 67 percent of gross
 
01:31:08.870 --> 01:31:08.880 align:start position:0%
expenditures for prescription drugs
 
01:31:12.890 --> 01:31:12.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:15.169 --> 01:31:15.179 align:start position:0%
if you look at the next one which is
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
from Eli Lilly
 
01:31:19.550 --> 01:31:19.560 align:start position:0%
what you'll see on that one
 
01:31:22.370 --> 01:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
is back in 2016
 
01:31:25.430 --> 01:31:25.440 align:start position:0%
the list price of the drug was 246
 
01:31:25.440 --> 01:31:27.110 align:start position:0%
the list price of the drug was 246
dollars

01:31:27.110 --> 01:31:27.120 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:31:28.550 --> 01:31:28.560 align:start position:0%
the net price that they actually
 
01:31:31.550 --> 01:31:31.560 align:start position:0%
received was 59.
 
01:31:34.129 --> 01:31:34.139 align:start position:0%
yet in 2020
 
01:31:37.129 --> 01:31:37.139 align:start position:0%
the list price was 275 dollars but the
 
01:31:40.850 --> 01:31:40.860 align:start position:0%
net to Lily went down to 50.
 
01:31:43.070 --> 01:31:43.080 align:start position:0%
when you do the math what you'll find
 
01:31:45.890 --> 01:31:45.900 align:start position:0%
out quickly is a list price went up by
 
01:31:47.689 --> 01:31:47.699 align:start position:0%
over 14 percent
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
but the Nets of the company
 
01:31:54.890 --> 01:31:54.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:57.410 --> 01:31:57.420 align:start position:0%
so I asked this committee to funnel them
 
01:31:59.030 --> 01:31:59.040 align:start position:0%
out the question
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
what is going on
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
why are drugs paid by the patients
 
01:32:05.270 --> 01:32:05.280 align:start position:0%
increasing well net prices to the
 
01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:06.719 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical manufacturers are
 
01:32:06.719 --> 01:32:07.850 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical manufacturers are
decreasing

01:32:07.850 --> 01:32:07.860 align:start position:0%
decreasing
 
01:32:09.950 --> 01:32:09.960 align:start position:0%
where is the money going
 
01:32:11.450 --> 01:32:11.460 align:start position:0%
who benefits from the lack of
 
01:32:13.189 --> 01:32:13.199 align:start position:0%
transparency and abolishing the
 
01:32:16.729 --> 01:32:16.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.770 --> 01:32:18.780 align:start position:0%
I think we all can agree that openness
 
01:32:20.810 --> 01:32:20.820 align:start position:0%
and transparency are essential
 
01:32:20.820 --> 01:32:22.129 align:start position:0%
and transparency are essential
components

01:32:22.129 --> 01:32:22.139 align:start position:0%
components
 
01:32:25.310 --> 01:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
for fully functioning democracies
 
01:32:28.370 --> 01:32:28.380 align:start position:0%
and to sustain a market economy
 
01:32:31.129 --> 01:32:31.139 align:start position:0%
built upon the free market
 
01:32:34.970 --> 01:32:34.980 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the legislature created RSA 26
 
01:32:37.729 --> 01:32:37.739 align:start position:0%
BB to establish the board a primary goal
 
01:32:39.530 --> 01:32:39.540 align:start position:0%
of the legislation was until this is to
 
01:32:41.510 --> 01:32:41.520 align:start position:0%
provide greater transparency to a
 
01:32:43.669 --> 01:32:43.679 align:start position:0%
non-transparent pricing system that will
 
01:32:45.290 --> 01:32:45.300 align:start position:0%
ensure that state and other public
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
payers optimize the opportunity
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
for savings on prescription drugs to
 
01:32:53.930 --> 01:32:53.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:56.270 --> 01:32:56.280 align:start position:0%
I wish to address a few issues in
 
01:32:58.370 --> 01:32:58.380 align:start position:0%
regards to the last meeting we had on
 
01:33:01.550 --> 01:33:01.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 172.
 
01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:03.900 align:start position:0%
there was discussion about having the
 
01:33:06.530 --> 01:33:06.540 align:start position:0%
ability to get into the rebates and the
 
01:33:08.450 --> 01:33:08.460 align:start position:0%
insurance department does it well they
 
01:33:10.430 --> 01:33:10.440 align:start position:0%
do it at the aggregated level what they
 
01:33:13.790 --> 01:33:13.800 align:start position:0%
don't do is that the drug level
 
01:33:16.430 --> 01:33:16.440 align:start position:0%
RSA and it's in your packet
 
01:33:19.189 --> 01:33:19.199 align:start position:0%
look at the line it's underlined does
 
01:33:21.590 --> 01:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
give the board the authority on specific
 
01:33:24.229 --> 01:33:24.239 align:start position:0%
drugs to get into where is the money
 
01:33:26.390 --> 01:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
going who's getting the rebates who's
 
01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:28.260 align:start position:0%
getting the fees to begin to understand
 
01:33:28.260 --> 01:33:29.629 align:start position:0%
getting the fees to begin to understand
it

01:33:29.629 --> 01:33:29.639 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:33:31.010 --> 01:33:31.020 align:start position:0%
number two
 
01:33:33.350 --> 01:33:33.360 align:start position:0%
there was a comment that the main board
 
01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:36.120 align:start position:0%
has been around and hasn't done a thing
 
01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
before you our four recommendations from
 
01:33:41.330 --> 01:33:41.340 align:start position:0%
the main board that they put together
 
01:33:44.750 --> 01:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
number three the board will use
 
01:33:46.910 --> 01:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
current data in chis which is the
 
01:33:49.070 --> 01:33:49.080 align:start position:0%
all-pair claims plus any other available
 
01:33:50.990 --> 01:33:51.000 align:start position:0%
data so we're not recreating another
 
01:33:55.910 --> 01:33:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:58.310 --> 01:33:58.320 align:start position:0%
and as far as the hearing goes
 
01:34:00.729 --> 01:34:00.739 align:start position:0%
last year
 
01:34:04.990 --> 01:34:05.000 align:start position:0%
this house heard House Bill 150 1566
 
01:34:07.490 --> 01:34:07.500 align:start position:0%
which also introduced to repeal the
 
01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:09.110 align:start position:0%
which also introduced to repeal the
board

01:34:09.110 --> 01:34:09.120 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
the house executive department of
 
01:34:13.729 --> 01:34:13.739 align:start position:0%
administrations heard and deliberated on
 
01:34:14.990 --> 01:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
that bill
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
it came out unanimously 19-0
 
01:34:20.990 --> 01:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
with a vote for interim study
 
01:34:25.370 --> 01:34:25.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:27.229 --> 01:34:27.239 align:start position:0%
on the other side of the wall
 
01:34:30.050 --> 01:34:30.060 align:start position:0%
we had Senate Bill 450
 
01:34:32.090 --> 01:34:32.100 align:start position:0%
which at that time was Senator Sherman
 
01:34:34.550 --> 01:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
sponsored to make some technical
 
01:34:37.370 --> 01:34:37.380 align:start position:0%
corrections to how to the RSA
 
01:34:46.250 --> 01:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:47.810 --> 01:34:47.820 align:start position:0%
and to give you an example of certain
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
things that happen you talk about
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%
redundancy the New Hampshire attorney
 
01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:54.000 align:start position:0%
general settled the case with centene
 
01:34:56.689 --> 01:34:56.699 align:start position:0%
Medicaid managed care provider for over
 
01:34:59.450 --> 01:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
21 million dollars
 
01:35:02.510 --> 01:35:02.520 align:start position:0%
read my lips 21 million dollars
 
01:35:04.310 --> 01:35:04.320 align:start position:0%
for incorrect pricing of Medicaid
 
01:35:04.320 --> 01:35:06.050 align:start position:0%
for incorrect pricing of Medicaid
prescriptions

01:35:06.050 --> 01:35:06.060 align:start position:0%
prescriptions
 
01:35:08.149 --> 01:35:08.159 align:start position:0%
same thing happened in Ohio for 88
 
01:35:08.159 --> 01:35:09.830 align:start position:0%
same thing happened in Ohio for 88
million

01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:35:11.149 --> 01:35:11.159 align:start position:0%
I'll bring this to your attention as
 
01:35:11.159 --> 01:35:12.110 align:start position:0%
I'll bring this to your attention as
well

01:35:12.110 --> 01:35:12.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:35:14.209 --> 01:35:14.219 align:start position:0%
when the bill passed
 
01:35:16.430 --> 01:35:16.440 align:start position:0%
to establish the board our governor
 
01:35:18.229 --> 01:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
governor cenino
 
01:35:20.030 --> 01:35:20.040 align:start position:0%
released the following statement I'll
 
01:35:22.490 --> 01:35:22.500 align:start position:0%
read a steal quote this bill will create
 
01:35:23.990 --> 01:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
a drug affordability board in New
 
01:35:26.090 --> 01:35:26.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to monitor changes
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
in the cost of prescription drugs to
 
01:35:30.229 --> 01:35:30.239 align:start position:0%
keep the industry honest
 
01:35:32.270 --> 01:35:32.280 align:start position:0%
and to keep an eye on prices to prevent
 
01:35:35.810 --> 01:35:35.820 align:start position:0%
price spikes often many challenges in
 
01:35:38.689 --> 01:35:38.699 align:start position:0%
healthcare can start to be addressed
 
01:35:41.629 --> 01:35:41.639 align:start position:0%
through greater transparency in pricing
 
01:35:44.990 --> 01:35:45.000 align:start position:0%
that transparency begins scrutiny and
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
accountability as to why the cost of a
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
particular drug is higher or higher than
 
01:35:51.470 --> 01:35:51.480 align:start position:0%
similar drugs
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
in my closing
 
01:35:54.590 --> 01:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
their Journey from the manufacturer to a
 
01:35:57.590 --> 01:35:57.600 align:start position:0%
patient passes through many entities
 
01:35:59.570 --> 01:35:59.580 align:start position:0%
via a complicated
 
01:35:59.580 --> 01:36:00.910 align:start position:0%
via a complicated
complex

01:36:00.910 --> 01:36:00.920 align:start position:0%
complex
 
01:36:02.689 --> 01:36:02.699 align:start position:0%
non-transparent path
 
01:36:05.030 --> 01:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
often to the detriment of the patient
 
01:36:07.850 --> 01:36:07.860 align:start position:0%
and public payers a primary goal the
 
01:36:09.470 --> 01:36:09.480 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board is
 
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
to bring greater transparency
 
01:36:13.250 --> 01:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
on pricing of prescription drugs to
 
01:36:15.169 --> 01:36:15.179 align:start position:0%
ensure the state of New Hampshire and
 
01:36:17.450 --> 01:36:17.460 align:start position:0%
other public payers save valuable Health
 
01:36:19.370 --> 01:36:19.380 align:start position:0%
Care dollars both for the government and
 
01:36:21.110 --> 01:36:21.120 align:start position:0%
for the taxpayer
 
01:36:25.090 --> 01:36:25.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:28.550 --> 01:36:28.560 align:start position:0%
so my question is if you're this part
 
01:36:30.890 --> 01:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
that's underlined here correct says that
 
01:36:34.189 --> 01:36:34.199 align:start position:0%
they must give you this information
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
and since this law has been on the books
 
01:36:36.239 --> 01:36:37.550 align:start position:0%
and since this law has been on the books
for

01:36:37.550 --> 01:36:37.560 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:36:40.910 --> 01:36:40.920 align:start position:0%
two and a half years or two years have
 
01:36:42.910 --> 01:36:42.920 align:start position:0%
you gotten any information from them
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
have they actually told you the dollar
 
01:36:47.930 --> 01:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
amounts of all rebates and fees
 
01:36:50.149 --> 01:36:50.159 align:start position:0%
concerning drugs collect have have the
 
01:36:53.689 --> 01:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
have they given you that information
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
before we get into that let me go back
 
01:36:57.830 --> 01:36:57.840 align:start position:0%
to a little bit of history of the board
 
01:36:59.810 --> 01:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
when the board was created
 
01:37:02.090 --> 01:37:02.100 align:start position:0%
we didn't have a funding mechanism as
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
far as out took paper expenses we get
 
01:37:06.649 --> 01:37:06.659 align:start position:0%
staff and so forth to accomplish exactly
 
01:37:09.709 --> 01:37:09.719 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for Mr chairman hunt
 
01:37:12.169 --> 01:37:12.179 align:start position:0%
we then ran into the issue with joint
 
01:37:14.390 --> 01:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee the two sponsors of
 
01:37:16.850 --> 01:37:16.860 align:start position:0%
this bill were on that committee opposed
 
01:37:19.970 --> 01:37:19.980 align:start position:0%
us getting funding for the board
 
01:37:22.430 --> 01:37:22.440 align:start position:0%
I repeat they opposed us getting funding
 
01:37:25.070 --> 01:37:25.080 align:start position:0%
for the board and tabled the request so
 
01:37:27.169 --> 01:37:27.179 align:start position:0%
when he talks about 95 of the requests
 
01:37:29.510 --> 01:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
going through it did include ours
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
so then we finally got through with
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
Senator Sherman at the time to make the
 
01:37:36.590 --> 01:37:36.600 align:start position:0%
technical correction to allow the board
 
01:37:39.169 --> 01:37:39.179 align:start position:0%
to have a non-lapsing fund to fund the
 
01:37:39.179 --> 01:37:39.770 align:start position:0%
to have a non-lapsing fund to fund the
board

01:37:39.770 --> 01:37:39.780 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:37:41.990 --> 01:37:42.000 align:start position:0%
then we got into rulemaking
 
01:37:44.510 --> 01:37:44.520 align:start position:0%
in rulemaking was a slugfest it was very
 
01:37:45.709 --> 01:37:45.719 align:start position:0%
difficult to get the rules through
 
01:37:47.870 --> 01:37:47.880 align:start position:0%
because of many oppositions along the
 
01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:48.830 align:start position:0%
because of many oppositions along the
way

01:37:48.830 --> 01:37:48.840 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:37:50.689 --> 01:37:50.699 align:start position:0%
so for the last two and a half years we
 
01:37:50.699 --> 01:37:51.890 align:start position:0%
so for the last two and a half years we
both

01:37:51.890 --> 01:37:51.900 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:37:54.410 --> 01:37:54.420 align:start position:0%
try to figure out how to get funded we
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
had to
 
01:37:57.830 --> 01:37:57.840 align:start position:0%
take back or push back the fuel and
 
01:37:58.870 --> 01:37:58.880 align:start position:0%
house bill
 
01:38:01.010 --> 01:38:01.020 align:start position:0%
1566 which is going to repeal the board
 
01:38:03.290 --> 01:38:03.300 align:start position:0%
we had to go through rule making process
 
01:38:06.050 --> 01:38:06.060 align:start position:0%
we're finally at the point now that we
 
01:38:08.629 --> 01:38:08.639 align:start position:0%
have things in place to hopefully get
 
01:38:10.250 --> 01:38:10.260 align:start position:0%
the staff and start asking the questions
 
01:38:13.070 --> 01:38:13.080 align:start position:0%
you're asking for so but I I don't see
 
01:38:14.570 --> 01:38:14.580 align:start position:0%
anything here in the sentence about
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
staff all I see here is that the board
 
01:38:21.950 --> 01:38:21.960 align:start position:0%
which is evidently volunteer all they
 
01:38:23.990 --> 01:38:24.000 align:start position:0%
have to do is have a specific perception
 
01:38:25.910 --> 01:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
drug and which those were provided
 
01:38:25.920 --> 01:38:27.169 align:start position:0%
drug and which those were provided
pursuance

01:38:27.169 --> 01:38:27.179 align:start position:0%
pursuance
 
01:38:30.649 --> 01:38:30.659 align:start position:0%
debt that that you have the right the
 
01:38:33.890 --> 01:38:33.900 align:start position:0%
legal right to have pbms and insurance
 
01:38:37.250 --> 01:38:37.260 align:start position:0%
companies to tell you what those rebates
 
01:38:39.590 --> 01:38:39.600 align:start position:0%
are and fees you don't need a board you
 
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
don't need a committee you don't need
 
01:38:43.129 --> 01:38:43.139 align:start position:0%
anybody the board has this statutory
 
01:38:46.450 --> 01:38:46.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:48.649 --> 01:38:48.659 align:start position:0%
yes please
 
01:38:50.330 --> 01:38:50.340 align:start position:0%
um so for the record my name is Tom
 
01:38:53.090 --> 01:38:53.100 align:start position:0%
Sherman I'm a former state senator and I
 
01:38:55.490 --> 01:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
sit on the board but I'm speaking for
 
01:38:58.729 --> 01:38:58.739 align:start position:0%
myself as a citizen of New Hampshire
 
01:39:01.189 --> 01:39:01.199 align:start position:0%
to answer your question
 
01:39:03.770 --> 01:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
we need an infrastructure in place both
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
to accept that data so if we ask that
 
01:39:09.830 --> 01:39:09.840 align:start position:0%
question much of what's coming in is
 
01:39:09.840 --> 01:39:11.030 align:start position:0%
question much of what's coming in is
proprietary

01:39:11.030 --> 01:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
proprietary
 
01:39:13.790 --> 01:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
so having a confidential database that
 
01:39:16.430 --> 01:39:16.440 align:start position:0%
that can go into that took more than six
 
01:39:18.169 --> 01:39:18.179 align:start position:0%
to eight months
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
there is oversight that requires a
 
01:39:23.689 --> 01:39:23.699 align:start position:0%
certain amount of
 
01:39:23.699 --> 01:39:24.530 align:start position:0%
certain amount of
um

01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:28.189 --> 01:39:28.199 align:start position:0%
overhead and that's where having an
 
01:39:30.350 --> 01:39:30.360 align:start position:0%
executive director and an administrative
 
01:39:32.689 --> 01:39:32.699 align:start position:0%
assistant which is what we determined
 
01:39:36.410 --> 01:39:36.420 align:start position:0%
would be the least amount of staff that
 
01:39:38.510 --> 01:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
we would need to be able to accept that
 
01:39:40.610 --> 01:39:40.620 align:start position:0%
data make sure it's appropriately
 
01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:42.229 align:start position:0%
data make sure it's appropriately
managed

01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
managed
 
01:39:42.239 --> 01:39:43.070 align:start position:0%
managed
um

01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:46.189 --> 01:39:46.199 align:start position:0%
we are administratively attached to the
 
01:39:47.390 --> 01:39:47.400 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
01:39:50.390 --> 01:39:50.400 align:start position:0%
but we are independent so we don't
 
01:39:50.400 --> 01:39:52.330 align:start position:0%
but we are independent so we don't
utilize

01:39:52.330 --> 01:39:52.340 align:start position:0%
utilize
 
01:39:55.850 --> 01:39:55.860 align:start position:0%
their staff with that function that
 
01:39:57.830 --> 01:39:57.840 align:start position:0%
you're describing we have to have our
 
01:40:00.250 --> 01:40:00.260 align:start position:0%
own staff we do utilize
 
01:40:02.990 --> 01:40:03.000 align:start position:0%
their channels of accepting data because
 
01:40:06.470 --> 01:40:06.480 align:start position:0%
it is proven confidential
 
01:40:09.050 --> 01:40:09.060 align:start position:0%
and finally just to go back to the
 
01:40:11.270 --> 01:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee one of the requests
 
01:40:14.209 --> 01:40:14.219 align:start position:0%
that they had that prompted the tabling
 
01:40:16.850 --> 01:40:16.860 align:start position:0%
is that we didn't have rules in place
 
01:40:21.250 --> 01:40:21.260 align:start position:0%
yet so we weren't going to get funded
 
01:40:24.229 --> 01:40:24.239 align:start position:0%
unless we had rules in place so that's
 
01:40:25.910 --> 01:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
where we pivoted
 
01:40:29.990 --> 01:40:30.000 align:start position:0%
last February and March to go back and
 
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
really focus on rules and so once we had
 
01:40:36.770 --> 01:40:36.780 align:start position:0%
rules and once we had SB 450 in place we
 
01:40:38.870 --> 01:40:38.880 align:start position:0%
now have the infrastructure as a board
 
01:40:41.750 --> 01:40:41.760 align:start position:0%
to move forward and do the work the
 
01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:43.380 align:start position:0%
actual work of the board rather than
 
01:40:46.370 --> 01:40:46.380 align:start position:0%
creating the infrastructure so I'm
 
01:40:48.350 --> 01:40:48.360 align:start position:0%
confused because I keep seeing stuff
 
01:40:53.030 --> 01:40:53.040 align:start position:0%
here about confidentiality yep so
 
01:40:55.490 --> 01:40:55.500 align:start position:0%
how why would they tell you anything
 
01:40:57.110 --> 01:40:57.120 align:start position:0%
you're out just because they have a law
 
01:40:59.390 --> 01:40:59.400 align:start position:0%
here that says they have to you they
 
01:41:01.490 --> 01:41:01.500 align:start position:0%
sure share it with you they also have a
 
01:41:02.450 --> 01:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
law that have protect their
 
01:41:02.460 --> 01:41:03.950 align:start position:0%
law that have protect their
confidentiality

01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:03.960 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
01:41:06.530 --> 01:41:06.540 align:start position:0%
so if you get a piece of paper that's
 
01:41:08.270 --> 01:41:08.280 align:start position:0%
blacked out everything's blacked out
 
01:41:10.550 --> 01:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
because it's confidential then you
 
01:41:11.870 --> 01:41:11.880 align:start position:0%
haven't gotten anything you don't need a
 
01:41:14.209 --> 01:41:14.219 align:start position:0%
you don't need an executive director you
 
01:41:15.830 --> 01:41:15.840 align:start position:0%
don't need a department a bunch of
 
01:41:17.870 --> 01:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
people to tell you that we this is
 
01:41:19.550 --> 01:41:19.560 align:start position:0%
useless information because it's all
 
01:41:23.870 --> 01:41:23.880 align:start position:0%
confidential no that's not actually the
 
01:41:27.229 --> 01:41:27.239 align:start position:0%
role of the board the the board would be
 
01:41:29.030 --> 01:41:29.040 align:start position:0%
able to accept the confident
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
confidential information do the analysis
 
01:41:35.870 --> 01:41:35.880 align:start position:0%
on it and then present de aggregated I'm
 
01:41:37.850 --> 01:41:37.860 align:start position:0%
sorry aggregated de-identified
 
01:41:40.669 --> 01:41:40.679 align:start position:0%
information to the public it's not
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
something that
 
01:41:46.070 --> 01:41:46.080 align:start position:0%
we are designed to accept
 
01:41:50.050 --> 01:41:50.060 align:start position:0%
highly confidential information from
 
01:41:52.609 --> 01:41:52.619 align:start position:0%
all different levels of people who are
 
01:41:55.370 --> 01:41:55.380 align:start position:0%
required to send data to us
 
01:41:57.910 --> 01:41:57.920 align:start position:0%
say that again are you or are you not
 
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
requiring Insurance com insurance
 
01:42:03.890 --> 01:42:03.900 align:start position:0%
company and bbms and manufacturers to
 
01:42:07.149 --> 01:42:07.159 align:start position:0%
disclose confidential information to you
 
01:42:14.450 --> 01:42:14.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:14.460 --> 01:42:15.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:42:15.470 --> 01:42:15.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what we do I've been a
 
01:42:20.810 --> 01:42:20.820 align:start position:0%
physician for 35 years
 
01:42:23.450 --> 01:42:23.460 align:start position:0%
we are used to working in a confidential
 
01:42:23.460 --> 01:42:25.310 align:start position:0%
we are used to working in a confidential
environment

01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
environment
 
01:42:28.129 --> 01:42:28.139 align:start position:0%
uh that's the way the Department of
 
01:42:30.169 --> 01:42:30.179 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services operates they
 
01:42:32.930 --> 01:42:32.940 align:start position:0%
are used to working in an environment
 
01:42:35.270 --> 01:42:35.280 align:start position:0%
that provides confidentiality and by the
 
01:42:36.950 --> 01:42:36.960 align:start position:0%
way the penalties for a breach of
 
01:42:41.649 --> 01:42:41.659 align:start position:0%
confidentiality are severe in this bill
 
01:42:44.450 --> 01:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
the problem I have is what you're
 
01:42:48.050 --> 01:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
looking for is this for instance as a
 
01:42:51.050 --> 01:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
doctor you have a contract with a
 
01:42:54.169 --> 01:42:54.179 align:start position:0%
insurance company
 
01:42:57.770 --> 01:42:57.780 align:start position:0%
right that's confidential right
 
01:43:00.050 --> 01:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
nobody you're not supposed to share you
 
01:43:01.430 --> 01:43:01.440 align:start position:0%
are borrowed from sharing it an
 
01:43:02.810 --> 01:43:02.820 align:start position:0%
insurance company is better to share
 
01:43:04.129 --> 01:43:04.139 align:start position:0%
that information
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
but but that's not what we're asking for
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
that we can't ask for that that's
 
01:43:11.270 --> 01:43:11.280 align:start position:0%
exactly what you're asking no you're
 
01:43:13.070 --> 01:43:13.080 align:start position:0%
asking we're not asking for a contract
 
01:43:15.050 --> 01:43:15.060 align:start position:0%
between an insurance company and a
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
physician no you're asking for what the
 
01:43:19.250 --> 01:43:19.260 align:start position:0%
fees were paid what the rebates were
 
01:43:21.410 --> 01:43:21.420 align:start position:0%
isn't that what the contracts are for
 
01:43:24.410 --> 01:43:24.420 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs not for
 
01:43:26.750 --> 01:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
Medical Services right but it's the
 
01:43:28.669 --> 01:43:28.679 align:start position:0%
exact same thing at the end of the day
 
01:43:30.649 --> 01:43:30.659 align:start position:0%
the end of the day
 
01:43:33.530 --> 01:43:33.540 align:start position:0%
what you're looking for is confidential
 
01:43:36.169 --> 01:43:36.179 align:start position:0%
you want to know what were the rebates
 
01:43:38.270 --> 01:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
what were the Kickbacks what were the
 
01:43:41.390 --> 01:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
things that we don't see between the
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
insurance company the pbms and the
 
01:43:45.950 --> 01:43:45.960 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical people and the
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
Distributors you're saying is
 
01:43:51.290 --> 01:43:51.300 align:start position:0%
transparency we want to see how much
 
01:43:53.270 --> 01:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
money was transparent how much money was
 
01:43:54.649 --> 01:43:54.659 align:start position:0%
sent back and forth
 
01:43:58.729 --> 01:43:58.739 align:start position:0%
but that's based on a contract that in
 
01:44:00.830 --> 01:44:00.840 align:start position:0%
the nature of that contract is
 
01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:02.450 align:start position:0%
the nature of that contract is
confidentiality

01:44:02.450 --> 01:44:02.460 align:start position:0%
confidentiality
 
01:44:04.970 --> 01:44:04.980 align:start position:0%
that's their secret formula isn't that
 
01:44:04.980 --> 01:44:08.870 align:start position:0%
that's their secret formula isn't that
true

01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:11.090 --> 01:44:11.100 align:start position:0%
care is being argumentative and not
 
01:44:13.330 --> 01:44:13.340 align:start position:0%
asking questions
 
01:44:16.370 --> 01:44:16.380 align:start position:0%
fair enough I'll I will back off you
 
01:44:18.530 --> 01:44:18.540 align:start position:0%
don't have to answer it the question is
 
01:44:18.540 --> 01:44:20.629 align:start position:0%
don't have to answer it the question is
there

01:44:20.629 --> 01:44:20.639 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:44:23.810 --> 01:44:23.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:26.510 --> 01:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
okay can I also talk about the issue of
 
01:44:29.510 --> 01:44:29.520 align:start position:0%
the board funding itself this does not
 
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
go through the general fund it's outside
 
01:44:36.410 --> 01:44:36.420 align:start position:0%
of it so we're not taxing the taxpayer
 
01:44:37.970 --> 01:44:37.980 align:start position:0%
um I agree with representative Gibbs
 
01:44:39.590 --> 01:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
with its attacks if he will call what
 
01:44:41.870 --> 01:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
you want it's outside of the general
 
01:44:44.510 --> 01:44:44.520 align:start position:0%
fund and therefore when you talk about
 
01:44:47.149 --> 01:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
it going to Ways and Means of going to
 
01:44:48.890 --> 01:44:48.900 align:start position:0%
the fiscal committee and so forth that
 
01:44:50.750 --> 01:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
deals with the general fund this is
 
01:44:52.129 --> 01:44:52.139 align:start position:0%
outside of that
 
01:44:54.290 --> 01:44:54.300 align:start position:0%
so just remember that in that context as
 
01:44:54.300 --> 01:44:55.970 align:start position:0%
so just remember that in that context as
well

01:44:55.970 --> 01:44:55.980 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:44:58.729 --> 01:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
um part of the whole thing is if we
 
01:45:00.430 --> 01:45:00.440 align:start position:0%
begin to understand
 
01:45:03.950 --> 01:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
what's happening in the marketplace
 
01:45:06.050 --> 01:45:06.060 align:start position:0%
the goal of the board is to create
 
01:45:08.629 --> 01:45:08.639 align:start position:0%
strategies to help the public payers
 
01:45:10.850 --> 01:45:10.860 align:start position:0%
reduce the overall cost
 
01:45:12.890 --> 01:45:12.900 align:start position:0%
Maine has done that they came back with
 
01:45:14.270 --> 01:45:14.280 align:start position:0%
some recommendations
 
01:45:16.669 --> 01:45:16.679 align:start position:0%
I think would like to build on
 
01:45:19.129 --> 01:45:19.139 align:start position:0%
as the board there are ways to help
 
01:45:21.050 --> 01:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
people if you begin to understand the
 
01:45:21.060 --> 01:45:22.010 align:start position:0%
people if you begin to understand the
marketplace

01:45:22.010 --> 01:45:22.020 align:start position:0%
marketplace
 
01:45:24.050 --> 01:45:24.060 align:start position:0%
it's like I said before it's complex
 
01:45:25.910 --> 01:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's convoluted and it's not
 
01:45:28.370 --> 01:45:28.380 align:start position:0%
straightforward but having people
 
01:45:30.830 --> 01:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
who really take the time including the
 
01:45:33.169 --> 01:45:33.179 align:start position:0%
board to understand it the goal is to
 
01:45:35.330 --> 01:45:35.340 align:start position:0%
help people become better buyers of
 
01:45:37.490 --> 01:45:37.500 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs so they can save the
 
01:45:39.290 --> 01:45:39.300 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollar
 
01:45:39.300 --> 01:45:42.550 align:start position:0%
taxpayer dollar
foreign

01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:45.050 --> 01:45:45.060 align:start position:0%
well this is awkward because we got
 
01:45:46.729 --> 01:45:46.739 align:start position:0%
people want to ask questions and then
 
01:45:49.490 --> 01:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
you want to testify again so we got to
 
01:45:52.250 --> 01:45:52.260 align:start position:0%
get to the chase okay representative
 
01:45:52.260 --> 01:45:55.550 align:start position:0%
get to the chase okay representative
purcelli

01:45:55.550 --> 01:45:55.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:57.290 --> 01:45:57.300 align:start position:0%
sure I understand the funding so we're
 
01:46:02.510 --> 01:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:04.189 --> 01:46:04.199 align:start position:0%
funding mechanism
 
01:46:05.870 --> 01:46:05.880 align:start position:0%
sure thank you
 
01:46:07.850 --> 01:46:07.860 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanism is what they call
 
01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:10.320 align:start position:0%
assessment fees it's fees lebudon to the
 
01:46:11.930 --> 01:46:11.940 align:start position:0%
individuals of the entities within the
 
01:46:13.490 --> 01:46:13.500 align:start position:0%
pharmacy supply chain
 
01:46:16.189 --> 01:46:16.199 align:start position:0%
so that's how the board is being funded
 
01:46:17.930 --> 01:46:17.940 align:start position:0%
it's not coming from funds from the
 
01:46:17.940 --> 01:46:18.890 align:start position:0%
it's not coming from funds from the
general

01:46:18.890 --> 01:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:46:21.950 --> 01:46:21.960 align:start position:0%
fund which is taxpayer dollars
 
01:46:24.050 --> 01:46:24.060 align:start position:0%
for the question you may inquire could
 
01:46:26.570 --> 01:46:26.580 align:start position:0%
that potentially increase the cost of
 
01:46:30.709 --> 01:46:30.719 align:start position:0%
the drugs or premium insurance premiums
 
01:46:33.669 --> 01:46:33.679 align:start position:0%
well when you consider the fact that the
 
01:46:37.070 --> 01:46:37.080 align:start position:0%
prescriptions in the U.S is a half a
 
01:46:39.050 --> 01:46:39.060 align:start position:0%
billion dollars and you look at
 
01:46:41.209 --> 01:46:41.219 align:start position:0%
something may cost 500 000 to run the
 
01:46:41.219 --> 01:46:42.290 align:start position:0%
something may cost 500 000 to run the
board

01:46:42.290 --> 01:46:42.300 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:46:44.390 --> 01:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
I guess you could possibly look at it as
 
01:46:48.050 --> 01:46:48.060 align:start position:0%
a intimate intestinal amount to the fee
 
01:46:49.910 --> 01:46:49.920 align:start position:0%
but same time what you need to think
 
01:46:51.350 --> 01:46:51.360 align:start position:0%
about is how much money can we save
 
01:46:53.570 --> 01:46:53.580 align:start position:0%
because if we can save the taxpayers
 
01:46:55.310 --> 01:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
more than five hundred thousand dollars
 
01:46:57.050 --> 01:46:57.060 align:start position:0%
I'm sure we will
 
01:47:00.830 --> 01:47:00.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
an assessment by the way are running
 
01:47:05.330 --> 01:47:05.340 align:start position:0%
between 500 to a thousand dollars on a
 
01:47:08.270 --> 01:47:08.280 align:start position:0%
company it's multi-million dollars
 
01:47:10.490 --> 01:47:10.500 align:start position:0%
okay representative Burroughs
 
01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for taking my
 
01:47:14.270 --> 01:47:14.280 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for saying that
 
01:47:15.770 --> 01:47:15.780 align:start position:0%
this is convoluted because my head is
 
01:47:15.780 --> 01:47:17.090 align:start position:0%
this is convoluted because my head is
spinning

01:47:17.090 --> 01:47:17.100 align:start position:0%
spinning
 
01:47:19.490 --> 01:47:19.500 align:start position:0%
um what I'd I'd like to understand is I
 
01:47:21.590 --> 01:47:21.600 align:start position:0%
mean I've heard testimony that you can't
 
01:47:23.990 --> 01:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
get the confidential data that you need
 
01:47:26.090 --> 01:47:26.100 align:start position:0%
and you can and I don't I don't feel
 
01:47:28.370 --> 01:47:28.380 align:start position:0%
like um I didn't feel like we got an
 
01:47:30.290 --> 01:47:30.300 align:start position:0%
answer and and I'd like to hear it from
 
01:47:32.390 --> 01:47:32.400 align:start position:0%
your perspective
 
01:47:34.490 --> 01:47:34.500 align:start position:0%
short of it yes
 
01:47:37.310 --> 01:47:37.320 align:start position:0%
we can if you look at the statute we can
 
01:47:39.470 --> 01:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
require the information to be sent to
 
01:47:42.830 --> 01:47:42.840 align:start position:0%
the board again back to what Dr Sherman
 
01:47:42.840 --> 01:47:43.970 align:start position:0%
the board again back to what Dr Sherman
said

01:47:43.970 --> 01:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
said
 
01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
the information we're asking for is
 
01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:47.689 align:start position:0%
the information we're asking for is
confidential

01:47:47.689 --> 01:47:47.699 align:start position:0%
confidential
 
01:47:50.390 --> 01:47:50.400 align:start position:0%
and because of the nature we wanted to
 
01:47:52.370 --> 01:47:52.380 align:start position:0%
be sure the manufacturers or anyone else
 
01:47:54.050 --> 01:47:54.060 align:start position:0%
submitting that information to the board
 
01:47:56.090 --> 01:47:56.100 align:start position:0%
is protected with that confidential
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
information so the consequence that
 
01:48:00.050 --> 01:48:00.060 align:start position:0%
anyone who
 
01:48:01.729 --> 01:48:01.739 align:start position:0%
has access to the information and
 
01:48:05.149 --> 01:48:05.159 align:start position:0%
releases it is a criminal offense it's
 
01:48:07.250 --> 01:48:07.260 align:start position:0%
taken seriously there's only a handful
 
01:48:08.570 --> 01:48:08.580 align:start position:0%
of people can actually get to the data
 
01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
so answer your question yes we can
 
01:48:12.229 --> 01:48:12.239 align:start position:0%
receive it we can ask for it and receive
 
01:48:12.239 --> 01:48:13.370 align:start position:0%
receive it we can ask for it and receive
it

01:48:13.370 --> 01:48:13.380 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:48:15.649 --> 01:48:15.659 align:start position:0%
further questions are you receiving it
 
01:48:17.270 --> 01:48:17.280 align:start position:0%
now or you can't because you don't have
 
01:48:19.669 --> 01:48:19.679 align:start position:0%
the uh staff in the infrastructure we
 
01:48:20.689 --> 01:48:20.699 align:start position:0%
don't have the staff and the
 
01:48:22.430 --> 01:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
infrastructure and no manufacturer is
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
going to send us information that's
 
01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:25.320 align:start position:0%
confidential if we don't have a process
 
01:48:27.229 --> 01:48:27.239 align:start position:0%
in place to protect it and we can't put
 
01:48:29.030 --> 01:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
the process in place to protect it we
 
01:48:31.129 --> 01:48:31.139 align:start position:0%
don't have to snap
 
01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:40.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:42.659 align:start position:0%
I've had top secret clearances with the
 
01:48:44.810 --> 01:48:44.820 align:start position:0%
military for 53 years
 
01:48:46.609 --> 01:48:46.619 align:start position:0%
I understand the notion of
 
01:48:50.570 --> 01:48:50.580 align:start position:0%
confidentiality really really well
 
01:48:54.770 --> 01:48:54.780 align:start position:0%
if you sign an NDA that is acceptable to
 
01:48:57.350 --> 01:48:57.360 align:start position:0%
the PDM
 
01:49:00.590 --> 01:49:00.600 align:start position:0%
and you provide a database
 
01:49:04.070 --> 01:49:04.080 align:start position:0%
that has the proper security
 
01:49:07.910 --> 01:49:07.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:10.910 --> 01:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
are you allowed to use the data then get
 
01:49:13.609 --> 01:49:13.619 align:start position:0%
the data not redacted but get the data
 
01:49:15.470 --> 01:49:15.480 align:start position:0%
that you're asking for as long as you
 
01:49:18.410 --> 01:49:18.420 align:start position:0%
have that NDA and a proper storage
 
01:49:21.410 --> 01:49:21.420 align:start position:0%
location are you then allowed to you get
 
01:49:24.070 --> 01:49:24.080 align:start position:0%
the data use the data
 
01:49:26.870 --> 01:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
aggregate the data come out with
 
01:49:30.010 --> 01:49:30.020 align:start position:0%
conclusions and the conclusions do not
 
01:49:32.990 --> 01:49:33.000 align:start position:0%
violate the NDA
 
01:49:35.570 --> 01:49:35.580 align:start position:0%
then are you set up to do what you need
 
01:49:37.609 --> 01:49:37.619 align:start position:0%
to do
 
01:49:37.619 --> 01:49:38.950 align:start position:0%
to do
yes

01:49:38.950 --> 01:49:38.960 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
and if I may that's not the only
 
01:49:46.729 --> 01:49:46.739 align:start position:0%
database that we would be using
 
01:49:48.950 --> 01:49:48.960 align:start position:0%
some of the earlier testimony today
 
01:49:51.470 --> 01:49:51.480 align:start position:0%
talked about what was called
 
01:49:55.129 --> 01:49:55.139 align:start position:0%
redundancies I would say it's resources
 
01:49:58.250 --> 01:49:58.260 align:start position:0%
that are available already so we don't
 
01:50:00.530 --> 01:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
have to recreate them which is database
 
01:50:03.770 --> 01:50:03.780 align:start position:0%
there's database at UNH database at
 
01:50:03.780 --> 01:50:04.729 align:start position:0%
there's database at UNH database at
Dartmouth

01:50:04.729 --> 01:50:04.739 align:start position:0%
Dartmouth
 
01:50:06.910 --> 01:50:06.920 align:start position:0%
database and these are
 
01:50:09.890 --> 01:50:09.900 align:start position:0%
large databases that look at New
 
01:50:09.900 --> 01:50:10.990 align:start position:0%
large databases that look at New
Hampshire

01:50:10.990 --> 01:50:11.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:50:14.930 --> 01:50:14.940 align:start position:0%
they are in different places not all in
 
01:50:16.490 --> 01:50:16.500 align:start position:0%
the department of insurance by the way
 
01:50:19.850 --> 01:50:19.860 align:start position:0%
some are in HHS some are in universities
 
01:50:21.470 --> 01:50:21.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:50:24.590 --> 01:50:24.600 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the board which does not
 
01:50:26.810 --> 01:50:26.820 align:start position:0%
exist right now
 
01:50:29.770 --> 01:50:29.780 align:start position:0%
is the ability to pull these databases
 
01:50:32.810 --> 01:50:32.820 align:start position:0%
and actually answer questions
 
01:50:35.450 --> 01:50:35.460 align:start position:0%
so that we can
 
01:50:39.550 --> 01:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
put together strategies moving forward
 
01:50:43.609 --> 01:50:43.619 align:start position:0%
on how to lower cost for the taxpayers
 
01:50:47.810 --> 01:50:47.820 align:start position:0%
on prescription drugs if you don't
 
01:50:49.189 --> 01:50:49.199 align:start position:0%
do this
 
01:50:51.770 --> 01:50:51.780 align:start position:0%
the Black Box stays in place
 
01:50:53.810 --> 01:50:53.820 align:start position:0%
nobody knows
 
01:50:55.850 --> 01:50:55.860 align:start position:0%
what's happening
 
01:50:59.450 --> 01:50:59.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:59.460 --> 01:51:00.649 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:51:00.649 --> 01:51:00.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:03.530 --> 01:51:03.540 align:start position:0%
if I could I also wanted to mention
 
01:51:06.590 --> 01:51:06.600 align:start position:0%
again as I mentioned last week
 
01:51:11.270 --> 01:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
that reverse auction is one tool
 
01:51:14.030 --> 01:51:14.040 align:start position:0%
I co-sponsored that bill
 
01:51:18.350 --> 01:51:18.360 align:start position:0%
it was in that Christmas tree bill
 
01:51:20.629 --> 01:51:20.639 align:start position:0%
it has not been repealed because it's
 
01:51:20.639 --> 01:51:22.010 align:start position:0%
it has not been repealed because it's
working

01:51:22.010 --> 01:51:22.020 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:51:24.229 --> 01:51:24.239 align:start position:0%
and it's working because it was able to
 
01:51:28.550 --> 01:51:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
so I just want to make sure people
 
01:51:33.229 --> 01:51:33.239 align:start position:0%
understand what the reverse auction
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
does not in detail but recognize that
 
01:51:40.370 --> 01:51:40.380 align:start position:0%
this is all a part of a package of bills
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
that we did back in 2020 together
 
01:51:45.590 --> 01:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
strongly bipartisan in fact it remains
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
strongly bipartisan
 
01:51:51.109 --> 01:51:51.119 align:start position:0%
um to do everything we possibly can to
 
01:51:53.090 --> 01:51:53.100 align:start position:0%
lift the veil off of prescription drug
 
01:51:57.109 --> 01:51:57.119 align:start position:0%
pricing not violating proprietary
 
01:52:01.609 --> 01:52:01.619 align:start position:0%
information but using a tool to
 
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
understand why
 
01:52:05.810 --> 01:52:05.820 align:start position:0%
prescriptions drug prescription drugs
 
01:52:07.729 --> 01:52:07.739 align:start position:0%
are costing so much
 
01:52:10.850 --> 01:52:10.860 align:start position:0%
and not prices but cost
 
01:52:13.609 --> 01:52:13.619 align:start position:0%
and how we can bring that cost down
 
01:52:16.790 --> 01:52:16.800 align:start position:0%
without this bill we continue forward in
 
01:52:18.050 --> 01:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
the way we're doing
 
01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
no centralized
 
01:52:23.149 --> 01:52:23.159 align:start position:0%
place to coalesce the information
 
01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
no place to I'm a gastroenterologist
 
01:52:27.470 --> 01:52:27.480 align:start position:0%
digest it
 
01:52:30.229 --> 01:52:30.239 align:start position:0%
and I won't go any further with how we
 
01:52:33.590 --> 01:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
regurgitate it but the bottom line is we
 
01:52:37.729 --> 01:52:37.739 align:start position:0%
need this board as a tool and you know I
 
01:52:40.910 --> 01:52:40.920 align:start position:0%
have yet to find a bill in my four terms
 
01:52:44.090 --> 01:52:44.100 align:start position:0%
in the legislature that's perfect
 
01:52:46.430 --> 01:52:46.440 align:start position:0%
and if there need to be changes along
 
01:52:48.470 --> 01:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
the way
 
01:52:50.450 --> 01:52:50.460 align:start position:0%
let's make the changes but let's not
 
01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:52.139 align:start position:0%
throw out the baby with the bath water
 
01:52:55.010 --> 01:52:55.020 align:start position:0%
and leave us as ignorant as we are right
 
01:52:57.050 --> 01:52:57.060 align:start position:0%
now about why prescription drugs are
 
01:52:58.790 --> 01:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
costing us so much in the state of New
 
01:53:00.290 --> 01:53:00.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and by the way
 
01:53:02.629 --> 01:53:02.639 align:start position:0%
I think we do things better than the
 
01:53:04.010 --> 01:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
United States of America in a lot of
 
01:53:06.350 --> 01:53:06.360 align:start position:0%
ways we're smaller
 
01:53:08.390 --> 01:53:08.400 align:start position:0%
we know each other at every different
 
01:53:10.310 --> 01:53:10.320 align:start position:0%
level of the government we can ask
 
01:53:12.169 --> 01:53:12.179 align:start position:0%
questions of each other maybe we just
 
01:53:15.350 --> 01:53:15.360 align:start position:0%
could come to an answer
 
01:53:18.470 --> 01:53:18.480 align:start position:0%
that the that Congress can't
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
I think that's possible
 
01:53:22.550 --> 01:53:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
01:53:27.070 --> 01:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh in order to request
 
01:53:29.689 --> 01:53:29.699 align:start position:0%
receive uh
 
01:53:33.169 --> 01:53:33.179 align:start position:0%
properly maintain Aggregate and analyze
 
01:53:35.930 --> 01:53:35.940 align:start position:0%
the data that you need in order to
 
01:53:37.850 --> 01:53:37.860 align:start position:0%
fulfill the board's statutory
 
01:53:40.970 --> 01:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is it necessary for the
 
01:53:44.330 --> 01:53:44.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:48.129 --> 01:53:48.139 align:start position:0%
yes yes thank you
 
01:53:51.050 --> 01:53:51.060 align:start position:0%
representative Terry
 
01:53:52.729 --> 01:53:52.739 align:start position:0%
well curiously and interestingly
 
01:53:54.530 --> 01:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
following on representative Gibbs
 
01:53:57.709 --> 01:53:57.719 align:start position:0%
question I'm looking at the handout that
 
01:54:00.410 --> 01:54:00.420 align:start position:0%
you provided from the state of Maine I'm
 
01:54:03.229 --> 01:54:03.239 align:start position:0%
curious to know if you know and would
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
you if you do would you please disclose
 
01:54:07.310 --> 01:54:07.320 align:start position:0%
or otherwise secure the information for
 
01:54:09.790 --> 01:54:09.800 align:start position:0%
me and the members of the committee
 
01:54:13.250 --> 01:54:13.260 align:start position:0%
is the main under the main statute is
 
01:54:15.250 --> 01:54:15.260 align:start position:0%
the main pdab
 
01:54:18.709 --> 01:54:18.719 align:start position:0%
uh supported by paid staff
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
uh what are the positions
 
01:54:26.030 --> 01:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
um and how is the main pdab uh funded
 
01:54:28.910 --> 01:54:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative Terry if I may there's a
 
01:54:30.169 --> 01:54:30.179 align:start position:0%
representative here today from the main
 
01:54:30.179 --> 01:54:31.189 align:start position:0%
representative here today from the main
board

01:54:31.189 --> 01:54:31.199 align:start position:0%
board
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
Jennifer Rick and I think you may want
 
01:54:35.990 --> 01:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
to hold that question for her
 
01:54:37.790 --> 01:54:37.800 align:start position:0%
so you you don't know and you prefer
 
01:54:39.470 --> 01:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
that I asked the domain he knows the
 
01:54:41.450 --> 01:54:41.460 align:start position:0%
details I do not thank you
 
01:54:44.450 --> 01:54:44.460 align:start position:0%
representative Airman
 
01:54:46.609 --> 01:54:46.619 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:54:48.229 --> 01:54:48.239 align:start position:0%
testifying before us and taking all
 
01:54:50.930 --> 01:54:50.940 align:start position:0%
these questions I'm looking at your most
 
01:54:54.310 --> 01:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
recent report for The Advisory Board
 
01:54:57.590 --> 01:54:57.600 align:start position:0%
2022. I just have some questions
 
01:55:00.109 --> 01:55:00.119 align:start position:0%
um so the the gist of the report it
 
01:55:01.970 --> 01:55:01.980 align:start position:0%
looks like five pages
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh you talk about the data that you're
 
01:55:07.490 --> 01:55:07.500 align:start position:0%
uh you referenced earlier and some of
 
01:55:09.410 --> 01:55:09.420 align:start position:0%
the limitations of that data you
 
01:55:12.350 --> 01:55:12.360 align:start position:0%
identify the top 25 most prescribed
 
01:55:15.109 --> 01:55:15.119 align:start position:0%
drugs and ones with cost increases so
 
01:55:18.410 --> 01:55:18.420 align:start position:0%
I'm just kind of restating uh rehashing
 
01:55:20.689 --> 01:55:20.699 align:start position:0%
what your report said but your goals for
 
01:55:22.669 --> 01:55:22.679 align:start position:0%
this coming year uh it includes
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
something finalized the mou with DHHS
 
01:55:30.350 --> 01:55:30.360 align:start position:0%
and uh could you explain what still
 
01:55:32.750 --> 01:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
needs to be finalized with DHHS sure
 
01:55:34.910 --> 01:55:34.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:55:37.790 --> 01:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure which RSA it is but when a
 
01:55:39.350 --> 01:55:39.360 align:start position:0%
board's Ministry look attached to an
 
01:55:41.149 --> 01:55:41.159 align:start position:0%
agency there has to be an mou between
 
01:55:43.310 --> 01:55:43.320 align:start position:0%
the the board if you will and the
 
01:55:46.850 --> 01:55:46.860 align:start position:0%
oversight which is DHHS here so the mou
 
01:55:48.410 --> 01:55:48.420 align:start position:0%
basically is defining what the
 
01:55:49.790 --> 01:55:49.800 align:start position:0%
responsibilities are in both parties
 
01:55:52.850 --> 01:55:52.860 align:start position:0%
what the cost is going to be how
 
01:55:54.770 --> 01:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
one party's paying the other party for
 
01:55:57.890 --> 01:55:57.900 align:start position:0%
resources they take or use so that's the
 
01:56:00.410 --> 01:56:00.420 align:start position:0%
whole mou between the board and the
 
01:56:01.310 --> 01:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
department of health Team and services
 
01:56:03.169 --> 01:56:03.179 align:start position:0%
we are now in the process of finalizing
 
01:56:05.629 --> 01:56:05.639 align:start position:0%
that hopefully next Tuesday we can come
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
to conclusion on the mou we've been
 
01:56:08.750 --> 01:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
working with
 
01:56:10.430 --> 01:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
uh the finance people trying to
 
01:56:11.930 --> 01:56:11.940 align:start position:0%
understand what the costs are that
 
01:56:14.510 --> 01:56:14.520 align:start position:0%
they're going to incur because of our
 
01:56:14.520 --> 01:56:16.310 align:start position:0%
they're going to incur because of our
staff

01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
staff
 
01:56:18.709 --> 01:56:18.719 align:start position:0%
that's what it's for for the question
 
01:56:21.709 --> 01:56:21.719 align:start position:0%
thank you why has it taken uh looks like
 
01:56:24.530 --> 01:56:24.540 align:start position:0%
almost 18 months to establish the mou
 
01:56:28.609 --> 01:56:28.619 align:start position:0%
with the dhhsi why such a long process
 
01:56:31.189 --> 01:56:31.199 align:start position:0%
We have basically volunteers on the
 
01:56:34.310 --> 01:56:34.320 align:start position:0%
board that have generously donated some
 
01:56:36.590 --> 01:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
of their time we don't have paid staff
 
01:56:38.270 --> 01:56:38.280 align:start position:0%
we don't have someone sit down and write
 
01:56:40.129 --> 01:56:40.139 align:start position:0%
things and work through it that way it
 
01:56:42.050 --> 01:56:42.060 align:start position:0%
comes back to a resource constraint
 
01:56:44.149 --> 01:56:44.159 align:start position:0%
so we had to get through trying to
 
01:56:46.250 --> 01:56:46.260 align:start position:0%
defend the bill the board last year we
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
worked on the rules we worked on a joint
 
01:56:49.729 --> 01:56:49.739 align:start position:0%
fiscal we've had many things in our
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
plate and the mou was probably one of
 
01:56:53.510 --> 01:56:53.520 align:start position:0%
the things you wanted to work towards
 
01:56:54.709 --> 01:56:54.719 align:start position:0%
which we're getting to on that list
 
01:56:54.719 --> 01:56:57.410 align:start position:0%
which we're getting to on that list
correct

01:56:57.410 --> 01:56:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:59.810 --> 01:56:59.820 align:start position:0%
and I would just add that the mou is
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
somewhat directed by the rules so
 
01:57:06.890 --> 01:57:06.900 align:start position:0%
the rules it's it's all cart or horse
 
01:57:10.010 --> 01:57:10.020 align:start position:0%
and in this case the rules had to come
 
01:57:12.050 --> 01:57:12.060 align:start position:0%
in place before fiscal would look at
 
01:57:14.990 --> 01:57:15.000 align:start position:0%
money that we ended up not needing
 
01:57:18.109 --> 01:57:18.119 align:start position:0%
because we now have our own way of our
 
01:57:21.410 --> 01:57:21.420 align:start position:0%
own means for generating revenue for
 
01:57:23.330 --> 01:57:23.340 align:start position:0%
not Revenue operating
 
01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:25.250 align:start position:0%
not Revenue operating
uh

01:57:25.250 --> 01:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:57:28.430 --> 01:57:28.440 align:start position:0%
uh the money we need to do to operate
 
01:57:30.649 --> 01:57:30.659 align:start position:0%
second of all we needed
 
01:57:33.709 --> 01:57:33.719 align:start position:0%
rules we can't do an mou without knowing
 
01:57:39.050 --> 01:57:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:41.450 --> 01:57:41.460 align:start position:0%
I would like to add the department has
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
been phenomenally supportive though
 
01:57:45.189 --> 01:57:45.199 align:start position:0%
throughout so
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
hats off to them and their willingness
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
to work with us
 
01:57:52.669 --> 01:57:52.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:56.050 --> 01:57:56.060 align:start position:0%
chair will call on David roguefort
 
01:57:58.310 --> 01:57:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative reprod who is in
 
01:58:06.169 --> 01:58:06.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:08.390 --> 01:58:08.400 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
01:58:09.770 --> 01:58:09.780 align:start position:0%
committee I was here two weeks ago and
 
01:58:11.810 --> 01:58:11.820 align:start position:0%
promised you I wouldn't be back and I
 
01:58:13.970 --> 01:58:13.980 align:start position:0%
want to apologize for being back here
 
01:58:16.129 --> 01:58:16.139 align:start position:0%
this is not a pharmacy issue it's more
 
01:58:17.629 --> 01:58:17.639 align:start position:0%
or less a prescription obviously a
 
01:58:19.609 --> 01:58:19.619 align:start position:0%
prescription drug issue
 
01:58:19.619 --> 01:58:20.330 align:start position:0%
prescription drug issue
um

01:58:20.330 --> 01:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:58:22.250 --> 01:58:22.260 align:start position:0%
I'm a pharmacist and I currently serve
 
01:58:23.330 --> 01:58:23.340 align:start position:0%
on the New Hampshire Board of Pharmacy
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
but I just wanted to stop in today and
 
01:58:30.310 --> 01:58:30.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:33.410 --> 01:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
metered opposition to to this bill and I
 
01:58:35.510 --> 01:58:35.520 align:start position:0%
say metered opposition because anytime I
 
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
hear the word executive director and
 
01:58:41.030 --> 01:58:41.040 align:start position:0%
administrative staff a radar goes up and
 
01:58:43.310 --> 01:58:43.320 align:start position:0%
you know I think that we've all been
 
01:58:46.669 --> 01:58:46.679 align:start position:0%
around this institution long enough to
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
understand the uh the dangers and
 
01:58:54.890 --> 01:58:54.900 align:start position:0%
potential for bureaucratic creep and
 
01:58:57.490 --> 01:58:57.500 align:start position:0%
um you know it's it's
 
01:59:00.709 --> 01:59:00.719 align:start position:0%
oftentimes I think we're compelled to do
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
things and take action because we think
 
01:59:05.689 --> 01:59:05.699 align:start position:0%
it might be the right thing to do and
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
many times those those things that we do
 
01:59:11.209 --> 01:59:11.219 align:start position:0%
become institutionalized and
 
01:59:14.209 --> 01:59:14.219 align:start position:0%
I am absolutely opposed to
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
institutionalized bureaucracy however
 
01:59:20.390 --> 01:59:20.400 align:start position:0%
I was here two weeks ago to talk about
 
01:59:22.490 --> 01:59:22.500 align:start position:0%
prescription drug pricing and I think
 
01:59:25.790 --> 01:59:25.800 align:start position:0%
from my testimony there uh you should
 
01:59:26.930 --> 01:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
have probably understood the
 
01:59:29.270 --> 01:59:29.280 align:start position:0%
complexities of it we talked about Mac
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
pricing we talked about different types
 
01:59:35.870 --> 01:59:35.880 align:start position:0%
of uh pricing structures the chairman
 
01:59:39.350 --> 01:59:39.360 align:start position:0%
um gave us some insight into things like
 
01:59:43.070 --> 01:59:43.080 align:start position:0%
any willing provider and uh and and many
 
01:59:46.609 --> 01:59:46.619 align:start position:0%
of the the the the effects that are on
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
this this system and again it's a
 
01:59:52.010 --> 01:59:52.020 align:start position:0%
complex system it's a system that we as
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in the state of New Hampshire
 
01:59:57.229 --> 01:59:57.239 align:start position:0%
are ultimately paying for in our in our
 
01:59:57.239 --> 01:59:58.910 align:start position:0%
are ultimately paying for in our in our
taxes

01:59:58.910 --> 01:59:58.920 align:start position:0%
taxes
 
01:59:58.920 --> 01:59:59.570 align:start position:0%
taxes
um

01:59:59.570 --> 01:59:59.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:01.370 --> 02:00:01.380 align:start position:0%
just to give an illustration of that
 
02:00:03.109 --> 02:00:03.119 align:start position:0%
there's a drug called Remicade that's
 
02:00:05.870 --> 02:00:05.880 align:start position:0%
available and remicates a drug that me
 
02:00:07.609 --> 02:00:07.619 align:start position:0%
as a pharmacist I can buy a wholesaler
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
for twelve hundred dollars for one vial
 
02:00:12.169 --> 02:00:12.179 align:start position:0%
of that I know in my district I could go
 
02:00:14.030 --> 02:00:14.040 align:start position:0%
to one facility and have that infused
 
02:00:16.250 --> 02:00:16.260 align:start position:0%
for five thousand dollars I could go to
 
02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
another facility within my district to
 
02:00:19.550 --> 02:00:19.560 align:start position:0%
have that infused for thirty thousand
 
02:00:21.770 --> 02:00:21.780 align:start position:0%
dollars so why is it that a twelve
 
02:00:23.870 --> 02:00:23.880 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar drug could cost
 
02:00:27.770 --> 02:00:27.780 align:start position:0%
a wildly different prices on our system
 
02:00:30.410 --> 02:00:30.420 align:start position:0%
um it could be contract that could very
 
02:00:33.290 --> 02:00:33.300 align:start position:0%
well be that that certain certain as
 
02:00:34.669 --> 02:00:34.679 align:start position:0%
part of an alien willing provider
 
02:00:36.290 --> 02:00:36.300 align:start position:0%
agreement agreed to do that it could be
 
02:00:38.990 --> 02:00:39.000 align:start position:0%
other things but I think that this board
 
02:00:41.870 --> 02:00:41.880 align:start position:0%
the intention of this board uh I hope
 
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
would unveil some of that stuff
 
02:00:44.940 --> 02:00:45.470 align:start position:0%
would unveil some of that stuff
um

02:00:45.470 --> 02:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:00:48.649 --> 02:00:48.659 align:start position:0%
and I say I hope because I this is
 
02:00:51.229 --> 02:00:51.239 align:start position:0%
obviously a relatively new board and
 
02:00:52.850 --> 02:00:52.860 align:start position:0%
we've heard today some of the struggles
 
02:00:54.649 --> 02:00:54.659 align:start position:0%
and obstacles that they've had just
 
02:00:56.810 --> 02:00:56.820 align:start position:0%
operating within the bureaucracy they're
 
02:00:58.430 --> 02:00:58.440 align:start position:0%
trying to operate the bureaucracy
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
themselves so my suggestion I think that
 
02:01:04.430 --> 02:01:04.440 align:start position:0%
at this point we all understand this
 
02:01:07.189 --> 02:01:07.199 align:start position:0%
board's been put on notice uh I would
 
02:01:09.169 --> 02:01:09.179 align:start position:0%
like to see the board have a fairly
 
02:01:12.649 --> 02:01:12.659 align:start position:0%
short leash to deliver results with a
 
02:01:14.990 --> 02:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
certain period of time my recommendation
 
02:01:17.450 --> 02:01:17.460 align:start position:0%
would to be to to give them a little
 
02:01:19.850 --> 02:01:19.860 align:start position:0%
latitude to deliver results if they
 
02:01:21.589 --> 02:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
can't give us results and actionable
 
02:01:23.750 --> 02:01:23.760 align:start position:0%
items to decrease drug prices in the
 
02:01:25.370 --> 02:01:25.380 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I'll be the first
 
02:01:27.470 --> 02:01:27.480 align:start position:0%
one to sign on to that bill to cancel
 
02:01:30.109 --> 02:01:30.119 align:start position:0%
this board but I think it's Hasty at
 
02:01:31.250 --> 02:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
this point I think we're a little
 
02:01:34.850 --> 02:01:34.860 align:start position:0%
premature so that's why I I would ask
 
02:01:39.070 --> 02:01:39.080 align:start position:0%
that you oppose uh 130.
 
02:01:43.189 --> 02:01:43.199 align:start position:0%
so the one of the contentions is that we
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
want transparency and so therefore we
 
02:01:47.330 --> 02:01:47.340 align:start position:0%
can lower drug prices
 
02:01:51.109 --> 02:01:51.119 align:start position:0%
so what in your mind you think they're
 
02:01:53.689 --> 02:01:53.699 align:start position:0%
going to find in transparency that will
 
02:01:57.050 --> 02:01:57.060 align:start position:0%
help us actually lower drug prices my
 
02:01:58.490 --> 02:01:58.500 align:start position:0%
opinion I'm going to give you my opinion
 
02:02:00.890 --> 02:02:00.900 align:start position:0%
this is Dave's opinion I think that
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
there's uh so let me give you let me let
 
02:02:06.589 --> 02:02:06.599 align:start position:0%
me give you an example of this so and
 
02:02:08.990 --> 02:02:09.000 align:start position:0%
then and then I can expound on that a
 
02:02:12.649 --> 02:02:12.659 align:start position:0%
little bit so uh anecdotal I have a
 
02:02:14.450 --> 02:02:14.460 align:start position:0%
friend who worked for a drug company
 
02:02:17.390 --> 02:02:17.400 align:start position:0%
down in Florida they they came up with a
 
02:02:20.570 --> 02:02:20.580 align:start position:0%
delivery system that would deliver a
 
02:02:22.550 --> 02:02:22.560 align:start position:0%
hormone drug that was typically
 
02:02:25.609 --> 02:02:25.619 align:start position:0%
available in a cream in a capsule it was
 
02:02:27.229 --> 02:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
something that would be inserted in a
 
02:02:30.109 --> 02:02:30.119 align:start position:0%
capsule it is wildly popular people
 
02:02:32.390 --> 02:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
using creams you know they're messy
 
02:02:35.149 --> 02:02:35.159 align:start position:0%
they're hard to use this thing would
 
02:02:37.970 --> 02:02:37.980 align:start position:0%
have really changed a lot of the way
 
02:02:39.830 --> 02:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
this particular drug was was delivered
 
02:02:43.850 --> 02:02:43.860 align:start position:0%
the drug itself costs 20 cents the
 
02:02:45.950 --> 02:02:45.960 align:start position:0%
packaging costs a dollar eighty I
 
02:02:47.270 --> 02:02:47.280 align:start position:0%
believe so it's a two dollar drug that
 
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
the actual cause but they spent millions
 
02:02:51.530 --> 02:02:51.540 align:start position:0%
of dollars researching the drug they've
 
02:02:52.609 --> 02:02:52.619 align:start position:0%
spent they had to go through the drug
 
02:02:54.350 --> 02:02:54.360 align:start position:0%
approval process to bring it to Market
 
02:02:56.930 --> 02:02:56.940 align:start position:0%
they did a lot of focus group studies
 
02:02:59.209 --> 02:02:59.219 align:start position:0%
and they realized that a drug this
 
02:03:01.609 --> 02:03:01.619 align:start position:0%
particular drug would have they would
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
have a market for it to Market it at
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
ninety dollars a month
 
02:03:07.609 --> 02:03:07.619 align:start position:0%
um the the women that they they
 
02:03:08.990 --> 02:03:09.000 align:start position:0%
interviewed felt that was a fair
 
02:03:10.729 --> 02:03:10.739 align:start position:0%
reasonable price it was something that
 
02:03:12.350 --> 02:03:12.360 align:start position:0%
even Insurance wouldn't cover they would
 
02:03:15.109 --> 02:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
be able to cover the ninety dollars well
 
02:03:17.089 --> 02:03:17.099 align:start position:0%
this is a New Drug Company they'd never
 
02:03:20.810 --> 02:03:20.820 align:start position:0%
launched a drug to Market before so as
 
02:03:22.490 --> 02:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
they started you know they have the drug
 
02:03:24.709 --> 02:03:24.719 align:start position:0%
ready to go it's it's it's made they've
 
02:03:27.589 --> 02:03:27.599 align:start position:0%
got the drug the nearing the approval
 
02:03:29.270 --> 02:03:29.280 align:start position:0%
process the finalization approval
 
02:03:33.169 --> 02:03:33.179 align:start position:0%
process and as they started going to
 
02:03:35.930 --> 02:03:35.940 align:start position:0%
wholesalers they wanted to cut that the
 
02:03:39.470 --> 02:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
pbms want to cut of that the the uh the
 
02:03:41.330 --> 02:03:41.340 align:start position:0%
switching companies the the various
 
02:03:44.209 --> 02:03:44.219 align:start position:0%
other people wanted a Medicaid you know
 
02:03:47.209 --> 02:03:47.219 align:start position:0%
Medicare they all wanted a piece of this
 
02:03:50.149 --> 02:03:50.159 align:start position:0%
drug uh as it as it became on the market
 
02:03:54.589 --> 02:03:54.599 align:start position:0%
so every time they had a fee they said
 
02:03:56.149 --> 02:03:56.159 align:start position:0%
well yeah we'll we'll do that we'll make
 
02:03:57.470 --> 02:03:57.480 align:start position:0%
sure we build it into the price so what
 
02:04:00.109 --> 02:04:00.119 align:start position:0%
was what started as a 90 a month drug
 
02:04:03.550 --> 02:04:03.560 align:start position:0%
ended up being about a 365 a month drug
 
02:04:06.169 --> 02:04:06.179 align:start position:0%
and you know that was all of those
 
02:04:07.970 --> 02:04:07.980 align:start position:0%
hidden fees that they didn't that they
 
02:04:09.890 --> 02:04:09.900 align:start position:0%
didn't anticipate it was a you know
 
02:04:11.990 --> 02:04:12.000 align:start position:0%
probably naiveness they probably should
 
02:04:14.209 --> 02:04:14.219 align:start position:0%
have invested in some more experience uh
 
02:04:16.490 --> 02:04:16.500 align:start position:0%
in their drug company but it added to
 
02:04:19.250 --> 02:04:19.260 align:start position:0%
the cost so to answer your question I
 
02:04:20.870 --> 02:04:20.880 align:start position:0%
think the commission the committee
 
02:04:24.649 --> 02:04:24.659 align:start position:0%
hopefully would expose some of that so
 
02:04:26.810 --> 02:04:26.820 align:start position:0%
you know as as taxpayers of people that
 
02:04:29.689 --> 02:04:29.699 align:start position:0%
are paying Medicaid to provide drugs
 
02:04:31.609 --> 02:04:31.619 align:start position:0%
I don't know about you but I don't think
 
02:04:33.290 --> 02:04:33.300 align:start position:0%
I should be paying a kick back to a
 
02:04:34.850 --> 02:04:34.860 align:start position:0%
wholesale company to keep it on their
 
02:04:37.370 --> 02:04:37.380 align:start position:0%
shelves you know we want to make sure
 
02:04:39.649 --> 02:04:39.659 align:start position:0%
that people have the drugs we shouldn't
 
02:04:42.229 --> 02:04:42.239 align:start position:0%
be I don't believe funding Kickbacks I
 
02:04:44.750 --> 02:04:44.760 align:start position:0%
say Kickbacks rebates incentives things
 
02:04:46.910 --> 02:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
like that so that's part of the
 
02:04:48.589 --> 02:04:48.599 align:start position:0%
transparency that's only part of the
 
02:04:50.270 --> 02:04:50.280 align:start position:0%
transparency I think that we're about to
 
02:04:52.189 --> 02:04:52.199 align:start position:0%
to find out
 
02:04:55.629 --> 02:04:55.639 align:start position:0%
um and so I hope my my my
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
hope would be that's the kind of things
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
that we would see so we here in the
 
02:05:02.570 --> 02:05:02.580 align:start position:0%
legislature could say no we're not going
 
02:05:04.490 --> 02:05:04.500 align:start position:0%
to pay that much when we you know fund
 
02:05:05.870 --> 02:05:05.880 align:start position:0%
our Medicaid we're only going to pay
 
02:05:07.729 --> 02:05:07.739 align:start position:0%
this much
 
02:05:10.729 --> 02:05:10.739 align:start position:0%
um you know I I believe the transparency
 
02:05:13.970 --> 02:05:13.980 align:start position:0%
will ultimately let the free market work
 
02:05:15.470 --> 02:05:15.480 align:start position:0%
because when things are hidden it's not
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
it's not a free market so but with that
 
02:05:21.410 --> 02:05:21.420 align:start position:0%
I don't think a committee should be
 
02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:23.760 align:start position:0%
languished and and they should be coming
 
02:05:25.310 --> 02:05:25.320 align:start position:0%
back year after year after year saying
 
02:05:26.330 --> 02:05:26.340 align:start position:0%
we're going to get some answers we're
 
02:05:27.530 --> 02:05:27.540 align:start position:0%
going to get some answers we're going to
 
02:05:29.209 --> 02:05:29.219 align:start position:0%
get some answers I think that there
 
02:05:31.370 --> 02:05:31.380 align:start position:0%
should be a timeline I think that we
 
02:05:33.229 --> 02:05:33.239 align:start position:0%
should have some actionable items within
 
02:05:34.970 --> 02:05:34.980 align:start position:0%
you know a certain period of time
 
02:05:37.790 --> 02:05:37.800 align:start position:0%
whatever that time is I'm not you know I
 
02:05:40.310 --> 02:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
I don't want to speculate on that but
 
02:05:42.589 --> 02:05:42.599 align:start position:0%
again if they can't deliver on what
 
02:05:44.030 --> 02:05:44.040 align:start position:0%
they're promising now that they've got
 
02:05:46.669 --> 02:05:46.679 align:start position:0%
all the the rules out of the way they've
 
02:05:48.370 --> 02:05:48.380 align:start position:0%
fought through some of their early
 
02:05:51.050 --> 02:05:51.060 align:start position:0%
bureaucratic bottles if they can't
 
02:05:54.950 --> 02:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
deliver liver after now then or now now
 
02:05:56.209 --> 02:05:56.219 align:start position:0%
they should be able to already hit the
 
02:05:57.950 --> 02:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
ground running
 
02:06:00.470 --> 02:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
um and let's set a timeline let's let's
 
02:06:02.689 --> 02:06:02.699 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that they have some you
 
02:06:04.430 --> 02:06:04.440 align:start position:0%
know some actionable items within a
 
02:06:05.750 --> 02:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
period of time and like I said if they
 
02:06:09.229 --> 02:06:09.239 align:start position:0%
can't do that then you know executive
 
02:06:11.870 --> 02:06:11.880 align:start position:0%
director is an administrative uh staff
 
02:06:14.750 --> 02:06:14.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be paid to tell us we're
 
02:06:17.510 --> 02:06:17.520 align:start position:0%
almost there so I again I I support the
 
02:06:17.520 --> 02:06:19.250 align:start position:0%
almost there so I again I I support the
commission

02:06:19.250 --> 02:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
commission
 
02:06:21.709 --> 02:06:21.719 align:start position:0%
but again temperate support I think that
 
02:06:23.570 --> 02:06:23.580 align:start position:0%
we should you know we should set a
 
02:06:27.250 --> 02:06:27.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:30.350 --> 02:06:30.360 align:start position:0%
thank you very much thank you uh chair
 
02:06:32.450 --> 02:06:32.460 align:start position:0%
we'll call on Jennifer wreck from
 
02:06:37.910 --> 02:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:41.390 --> 02:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:44.940 align:start position:0%
yes I think we um pronounce it Nash B uh
 
02:06:46.550 --> 02:06:46.560 align:start position:0%
the National Academy for State Health
 
02:06:46.560 --> 02:06:47.810 align:start position:0%
the National Academy for State Health
policy

02:06:47.810 --> 02:06:47.820 align:start position:0%
policy
 
02:06:50.689 --> 02:06:50.699 align:start position:0%
so uh good afternoon uh chairman hunt
 
02:06:53.510 --> 02:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee I am
 
02:06:56.390 --> 02:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
Jennifer reck I am director of Nashville
 
02:06:58.930 --> 02:06:58.940 align:start position:0%
Center on drug pricing in Portland Maine
 
02:07:02.629 --> 02:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
I would like to clarify that I am also a
 
02:07:04.310 --> 02:07:04.320 align:start position:0%
board member of Maine's prescription
 
02:07:06.649 --> 02:07:06.659 align:start position:0%
drug affordability board
 
02:07:07.970 --> 02:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
um and I'm happy to answer questions
 
02:07:10.970 --> 02:07:10.980 align:start position:0%
about that however I'm here today
 
02:07:15.649 --> 02:07:15.659 align:start position:0%
representing Nash B not the main board
 
02:07:17.450 --> 02:07:17.460 align:start position:0%
um in case you're not familiar with Nash
 
02:07:20.330 --> 02:07:20.340 align:start position:0%
B we're a nonpartisan organization that
 
02:07:23.089 --> 02:07:23.099 align:start position:0%
works really closely with states to
 
02:07:25.129 --> 02:07:25.139 align:start position:0%
develop and Implement Innovative State
 
02:07:28.250 --> 02:07:28.260 align:start position:0%
Health policy Solutions we recognize
 
02:07:30.709 --> 02:07:30.719 align:start position:0%
that state policy reflects the unique
 
02:07:34.250 --> 02:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
situation of States however and so for
 
02:07:36.649 --> 02:07:36.659 align:start position:0%
that reason we don't testify for or
 
02:07:38.890 --> 02:07:38.900 align:start position:0%
against legislation so I'm here today
 
02:07:41.870 --> 02:07:41.880 align:start position:0%
just to provide background information
 
02:07:44.149 --> 02:07:44.159 align:start position:0%
and to help answer any questions if I
 
02:07:44.159 --> 02:07:46.010 align:start position:0%
and to help answer any questions if I
can

02:07:46.010 --> 02:07:46.020 align:start position:0%
can
 
02:07:48.290 --> 02:07:48.300 align:start position:0%
um we created our Center on drug pricing
 
02:07:53.750 --> 02:07:53.760 align:start position:0%
in 2017 in response to hearing the need
 
02:07:56.209 --> 02:07:56.219 align:start position:0%
from States for strategies to take on
 
02:07:57.530 --> 02:07:57.540 align:start position:0%
drug pricing
 
02:07:59.930 --> 02:07:59.940 align:start position:0%
and we have since developed model
 
02:08:02.530 --> 02:08:02.540 align:start position:0%
legislation and provided technical
 
02:08:05.629 --> 02:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
assistance to support legislators and
 
02:08:07.609 --> 02:08:07.619 align:start position:0%
executive Brands officials trying to
 
02:08:10.129 --> 02:08:10.139 align:start position:0%
address the high cost of drugs and when
 
02:08:12.070 --> 02:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
bills are enacted we also support
 
02:08:15.649 --> 02:08:15.659 align:start position:0%
implementation with technical assistance
 
02:08:18.890 --> 02:08:18.900 align:start position:0%
so in 2017 Nash B released model
 
02:08:20.810 --> 02:08:20.820 align:start position:0%
legislation for prescription drug
 
02:08:23.870 --> 02:08:23.880 align:start position:0%
affordability board and since that time
 
02:08:27.470 --> 02:08:27.480 align:start position:0%
Six States have enacted such boards
 
02:08:30.890 --> 02:08:30.900 align:start position:0%
the pdabs as we call them
 
02:08:33.290 --> 02:08:33.300 align:start position:0%
um in Maine and New Hampshire are
 
02:08:35.390 --> 02:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
actually relatively unique amongst those
 
02:08:39.530 --> 02:08:39.540 align:start position:0%
boards in terms of their approach that
 
02:08:42.109 --> 02:08:42.119 align:start position:0%
approach being to set prescription drug
 
02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
spending targets for public purchasers
 
02:08:47.629 --> 02:08:47.639 align:start position:0%
and to make recommendations to enable
 
02:08:50.830 --> 02:08:50.840 align:start position:0%
public purchasers to meet those targets
 
02:08:53.990 --> 02:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
Nashville has been providing technical
 
02:08:57.290 --> 02:08:57.300 align:start position:0%
assistance to the pdabs to the the
 
02:09:00.530 --> 02:09:00.540 align:start position:0%
states implementing pdabs through a
 
02:09:03.129 --> 02:09:03.139 align:start position:0%
contract with the program on regulation
 
02:09:05.750 --> 02:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
Therapeutics and law at Harvard Medical
 
02:09:08.390 --> 02:09:08.400 align:start position:0%
School in Brigham and Women's Hospital
 
02:09:11.510 --> 02:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
we convene regular meetings so states
 
02:09:15.350 --> 02:09:15.360 align:start position:0%
can benefit from their tax from their
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
technical expertise and share their
 
02:09:20.390 --> 02:09:20.400 align:start position:0%
knowledge and experience
 
02:09:23.450 --> 02:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
these convenings allow States like New
 
02:09:25.550 --> 02:09:25.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to maximize use of their
 
02:09:28.370 --> 02:09:28.380 align:start position:0%
resources through no cost technical
 
02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:31.340 align:start position:0%
assistance and support
 
02:09:34.129 --> 02:09:34.139 align:start position:0%
states are purchasers of prescription
 
02:09:37.129 --> 02:09:37.139 align:start position:0%
drugs of course for state employees and
 
02:09:40.089 --> 02:09:40.099 align:start position:0%
retiree Health Plans State hospitals
 
02:09:43.330 --> 02:09:43.340 align:start position:0%
universities Corrections amongst others
 
02:09:46.010 --> 02:09:46.020 align:start position:0%
and as drug costs spiral New Hampshire
 
02:09:48.410 --> 02:09:48.420 align:start position:0%
of course still is required to balance
 
02:09:49.970 --> 02:09:49.980 align:start position:0%
its budget
 
02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
and the work of the prescription drug
 
02:09:54.649 --> 02:09:54.659 align:start position:0%
ability affordability board
 
02:09:56.689 --> 02:09:56.699 align:start position:0%
to set prescription drug spending
 
02:09:59.450 --> 02:09:59.460 align:start position:0%
targets and to advance strategy to meet
 
02:10:01.729 --> 02:10:01.739 align:start position:0%
those targets can help public purchasers
 
02:10:05.990 --> 02:10:06.000 align:start position:0%
struggling with high cost drugs
 
02:10:09.109 --> 02:10:09.119 align:start position:0%
nine states currently have set spending
 
02:10:12.589 --> 02:10:12.599 align:start position:0%
targets for overall annual growth in
 
02:10:16.010 --> 02:10:16.020 align:start position:0%
health care costs those benchmarks range
 
02:10:19.089 --> 02:10:19.099 align:start position:0%
from 3.1 to
 
02:10:21.290 --> 02:10:21.300 align:start position:0%
3.3.4 percent
 
02:10:24.050 --> 02:10:24.060 align:start position:0%
and are largely designed to better align
 
02:10:26.689 --> 02:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
Health Care spending growth with the
 
02:10:29.870 --> 02:10:29.880 align:start position:0%
state's overall economic growth because
 
02:10:32.689 --> 02:10:32.699 align:start position:0%
as we're all aware health care costs
 
02:10:36.290 --> 02:10:36.300 align:start position:0%
tend to outpace other sectors and
 
02:10:39.169 --> 02:10:39.179 align:start position:0%
aspects of the economy
 
02:10:42.169 --> 02:10:42.179 align:start position:0%
um in lieu of the unsustainable growth
 
02:10:44.209 --> 02:10:44.219 align:start position:0%
in prescription drug spending year over
 
02:10:44.219 --> 02:10:45.229 align:start position:0%
in prescription drug spending year over
year

02:10:45.229 --> 02:10:45.239 align:start position:0%
year
 
02:10:47.510 --> 02:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
a spending Target creates a guard rail
 
02:10:49.910 --> 02:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
and can help and send public payers to
 
02:10:52.070 --> 02:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
collaborate and develop policy Solutions
 
02:10:55.189 --> 02:10:55.199 align:start position:0%
the pdab plays the role of setting the
 
02:10:57.530 --> 02:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
appropriate targets and in supporting
 
02:11:00.109 --> 02:11:00.119 align:start position:0%
payers by identifying strategies to meet
 
02:11:02.990 --> 02:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
those spending targets can also offer
 
02:11:05.030 --> 02:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
public purchasers a leg up in
 
02:11:07.910 --> 02:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
negotiations offering them leverage when
 
02:11:10.129 --> 02:11:10.139 align:start position:0%
they push back against unsustainable
 
02:11:11.890 --> 02:11:11.900 align:start position:0%
growth and spending
 
02:11:14.570 --> 02:11:14.580 align:start position:0%
importantly the pdab allows public
 
02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
purchasers flexibility in how they would
 
02:11:19.850 --> 02:11:19.860 align:start position:0%
meet those targets
 
02:11:22.310 --> 02:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
um the pdub also enables the state to
 
02:11:23.870 --> 02:11:23.880 align:start position:0%
better understand prescription drug
 
02:11:25.310 --> 02:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
spending this is some of the
 
02:11:26.810 --> 02:11:26.820 align:start position:0%
transparency aspects we've been
 
02:11:29.629 --> 02:11:29.639 align:start position:0%
discussing and to identify specific
 
02:11:32.149 --> 02:11:32.159 align:start position:0%
issues and cost drivers that can inform
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
thoughtful evidence-driven policy making
 
02:11:38.209 --> 02:11:38.219 align:start position:0%
to achieve the common goal of clinically
 
02:11:41.030 --> 02:11:41.040 align:start position:0%
appropriate responsibly controlled
 
02:11:43.129 --> 02:11:43.139 align:start position:0%
prescription drug spending
 
02:11:45.290 --> 02:11:45.300 align:start position:0%
and as you continue your work on this
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
bill Nashville would be happy to help
 
02:11:50.209 --> 02:11:50.219 align:start position:0%
answer any questions that you may have
 
02:11:53.330 --> 02:11:53.340 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time
 
02:11:55.669 --> 02:11:55.679 align:start position:0%
thank you is uh my clerk would love to
 
02:11:57.589 --> 02:11:57.599 align:start position:0%
have your written testimony uh yeah I
 
02:11:59.510 --> 02:11:59.520 align:start position:0%
brought copies I'll share them yeah
 
02:12:01.189 --> 02:12:01.199 align:start position:0%
great thank you very much we have
 
02:12:02.390 --> 02:12:02.400 align:start position:0%
questions in the clinic where's
 
02:12:04.729 --> 02:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
representative Terry so it sounds like
 
02:12:07.070 --> 02:12:07.080 align:start position:0%
from your testimony and and your your
 
02:12:09.290 --> 02:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
title your position that you would be
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
able to uh speak
 
02:12:14.089 --> 02:12:14.099 align:start position:0%
to the question that I put
 
02:12:17.629 --> 02:12:17.639 align:start position:0%
previously with respect to Maine to the
 
02:12:19.850 --> 02:12:19.860 align:start position:0%
other States since you work with the
 
02:12:21.589 --> 02:12:21.599 align:start position:0%
other states as well or you're at least
 
02:12:24.910 --> 02:12:24.920 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable of those so I I am curious
 
02:12:27.410 --> 02:12:27.420 align:start position:0%
for whatever you can tell me whatever
 
02:12:30.229 --> 02:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
you can tell the committee as to how
 
02:12:33.109 --> 02:12:33.119 align:start position:0%
under the uh how many states did you say
 
02:12:35.209 --> 02:12:35.219 align:start position:0%
was it nine that happened Six States six
 
02:12:37.370 --> 02:12:37.380 align:start position:0%
states that have paid ABS
 
02:12:39.050 --> 02:12:39.060 align:start position:0%
um are they
 
02:12:41.390 --> 02:12:41.400 align:start position:0%
um do they do they all have paid staff
 
02:12:43.609 --> 02:12:43.619 align:start position:0%
or how many of them do how many of them
 
02:12:45.649 --> 02:12:45.659 align:start position:0%
don't and
 
02:12:49.010 --> 02:12:49.020 align:start position:0%
um and how are these pdabs funded in the
 
02:12:51.229 --> 02:12:51.239 align:start position:0%
uh other of the Six States
 
02:12:51.239 --> 02:12:52.790 align:start position:0%
uh other of the Six States
so

02:12:52.790 --> 02:12:52.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:12:54.649 --> 02:12:54.659 align:start position:0%
um I'll start with New Hampshire of
 
02:12:56.390 --> 02:12:56.400 align:start position:0%
course you're aware of and being as I
 
02:12:58.010 --> 02:12:58.020 align:start position:0%
pointed out is
 
02:12:59.870 --> 02:12:59.880 align:start position:0%
um similar in terms of its goals with
 
02:13:02.709 --> 02:13:02.719 align:start position:0%
the new as as the New Hampshire pdab is
 
02:13:07.490 --> 02:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
we also do not have any paid staff and
 
02:13:10.550 --> 02:13:10.560 align:start position:0%
have been in operation for about two
 
02:13:11.950 --> 02:13:11.960 align:start position:0%
years now
 
02:13:15.669 --> 02:13:15.679 align:start position:0%
we will get some support through another
 
02:13:19.250 --> 02:13:19.260 align:start position:0%
state office created the Office of
 
02:13:22.250 --> 02:13:22.260 align:start position:0%
affordable health care which did
 
02:13:24.830 --> 02:13:24.840 align:start position:0%
actually just yesterday announce an
 
02:13:26.390 --> 02:13:26.400 align:start position:0%
executive director that they're bringing
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
on so the main pdab will be supported
 
02:13:31.970 --> 02:13:31.980 align:start position:0%
through that office and through that
 
02:13:33.950 --> 02:13:33.960 align:start position:0%
executive director though that person is
 
02:13:38.569 --> 02:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
not dedicated solely to the main board
 
02:13:40.970 --> 02:13:40.980 align:start position:0%
um in the other four states
 
02:13:46.010 --> 02:13:46.020 align:start position:0%
um there are executive directors and
 
02:13:49.550 --> 02:13:49.560 align:start position:0%
staff in Maryland
 
02:13:53.149 --> 02:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
um Colorado and Oregon Washington passed
 
02:13:55.129 --> 02:13:55.139 align:start position:0%
more recently and I believe that they
 
02:13:57.530 --> 02:13:57.540 align:start position:0%
are searching for but haven't hired an
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
executive director yet
 
02:14:02.930 --> 02:14:02.940 align:start position:0%
um and the funding models are similar to
 
02:14:06.830 --> 02:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire's in terms of fees on drug
 
02:14:09.109 --> 02:14:09.119 align:start position:0%
manufacturers and pbms and other
 
02:14:11.450 --> 02:14:11.460 align:start position:0%
entities in the supply chain
 
02:14:14.569 --> 02:14:14.579 align:start position:0%
so none of the five states are fund fund
 
02:14:16.729 --> 02:14:16.739 align:start position:0%
therapy to Absolute General revenues but
 
02:14:19.250 --> 02:14:19.260 align:start position:0%
through assessments I believe that is
 
02:14:20.569 --> 02:14:20.579 align:start position:0%
correct I would have to triple check
 
02:14:22.129 --> 02:14:22.139 align:start position:0%
every state but I would be very
 
02:14:23.689 --> 02:14:23.699 align:start position:0%
surprised if there were General funding
 
02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:25.500 align:start position:0%
I can I can check and confirm that thank
 
02:14:28.729 --> 02:14:28.739 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:31.129 --> 02:14:31.139 align:start position:0%
representative thank you Mr chair and
 
02:14:33.050 --> 02:14:33.060 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming from Maine uh to
 
02:14:33.060 --> 02:14:34.430 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming from Maine uh to
testify

02:14:34.430 --> 02:14:34.440 align:start position:0%
testify
 
02:14:37.129 --> 02:14:37.139 align:start position:0%
um I think one of the uh previous
 
02:14:40.069 --> 02:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
speakers mentioned that the main pdab
 
02:14:42.649 --> 02:14:42.659 align:start position:0%
came up with four recommendations is
 
02:14:44.510 --> 02:14:44.520 align:start position:0%
that right so far
 
02:14:47.330 --> 02:14:47.340 align:start position:0%
uh I believe that was representative
 
02:14:49.790 --> 02:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
Merchant talking about recommendations
 
02:14:51.470 --> 02:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire board had made
 
02:14:54.050 --> 02:14:54.060 align:start position:0%
although we have we have put out
 
02:14:56.209 --> 02:14:56.219 align:start position:0%
um two annual reports that make
 
02:14:58.010 --> 02:14:58.020 align:start position:0%
recommendations and you're you're on
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
that board yes correct could you give us
 
02:15:02.209 --> 02:15:02.219 align:start position:0%
just a summary of those uh those four
 
02:15:03.649 --> 02:15:03.659 align:start position:0%
recommendations or however many
 
02:15:05.990 --> 02:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
recommendations there are um sure yeah
 
02:15:07.850 --> 02:15:07.860 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to share the the
 
02:15:09.830 --> 02:15:09.840 align:start position:0%
reports afterwards just in case I I'm
 
02:15:12.470 --> 02:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
not remembering them all
 
02:15:15.229 --> 02:15:15.239 align:start position:0%
um in last year's report which was our
 
02:15:18.890 --> 02:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
initial report uh focused
 
02:15:21.229 --> 02:15:21.239 align:start position:0%
um in large part on strategies that
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
public purchasers could take
 
02:15:25.250 --> 02:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
um thank you
 
02:15:26.450 --> 02:15:26.460 align:start position:0%
um so
 
02:15:28.550 --> 02:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
um for example
 
02:15:30.169 --> 02:15:30.179 align:start position:0%
um strategies that have already come up
 
02:15:31.790 --> 02:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
like stronger
 
02:15:33.790 --> 02:15:33.800 align:start position:0%
um Contracting with pbms through
 
02:15:37.550 --> 02:15:37.560 align:start position:0%
approaches like uh reverse auctions
 
02:15:39.830 --> 02:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
um but also delved into some specific
 
02:15:42.410 --> 02:15:42.420 align:start position:0%
contract Provisions
 
02:15:45.530 --> 02:15:45.540 align:start position:0%
um that would increase transparency and
 
02:15:48.530 --> 02:15:48.540 align:start position:0%
make contracts more favorable for public
 
02:15:51.649 --> 02:15:51.659 align:start position:0%
purchasers I believe we also addressed
 
02:15:55.189 --> 02:15:55.199 align:start position:0%
the concept of waste free formularies
 
02:15:58.729 --> 02:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
which is a review of drugs on the
 
02:16:01.069 --> 02:16:01.079 align:start position:0%
formulary to make sure there are no
 
02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
drugs on there that are essentially very
 
02:16:06.850 --> 02:16:06.860 align:start position:0%
high cost without added clinical benefit
 
02:16:09.950 --> 02:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
and there are some really egregious
 
02:16:14.870 --> 02:16:14.880 align:start position:0%
examples of some drugs that are really
 
02:16:14.880 --> 02:16:15.649 align:start position:0%
examples of some drugs that are really
um

02:16:15.649 --> 02:16:15.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:16:18.410 --> 02:16:18.420 align:start position:0%
clinically equivalent for example like
 
02:16:20.330 --> 02:16:20.340 align:start position:0%
some combined therapies will be
 
02:16:23.149 --> 02:16:23.159 align:start position:0%
clinically equivalent to two much
 
02:16:25.790 --> 02:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
cheaper drugs that would cost very
 
02:16:27.470 --> 02:16:27.480 align:start position:0%
little if you bought them separately but
 
02:16:29.569 --> 02:16:29.579 align:start position:0%
if you buy the combined agent may become
 
02:16:31.850 --> 02:16:31.860 align:start position:0%
suddenly very costly so that's the kind
 
02:16:35.929 --> 02:16:35.939 align:start position:0%
of example of a wasteful drug that
 
02:16:37.610 --> 02:16:37.620 align:start position:0%
public purchasers can review their
 
02:16:40.129 --> 02:16:40.139 align:start position:0%
formularies for
 
02:16:42.889 --> 02:16:42.899 align:start position:0%
um I believe we also recommended
 
02:16:44.810 --> 02:16:44.820 align:start position:0%
collaborative purchasing strategies
 
02:16:47.509 --> 02:16:47.519 align:start position:0%
looking at ways to strengthen purchasing
 
02:16:51.849 --> 02:16:51.859 align:start position:0%
power of public purchasers by combining
 
02:16:54.049 --> 02:16:54.059 align:start position:0%
lives that are covered under various
 
02:16:55.790 --> 02:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
plans to strengthen negotiating
 
02:16:59.150 --> 02:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
positions and strategies along that
 
02:17:03.730 --> 02:17:03.740 align:start position:0%
those lines and we also recommended some
 
02:17:06.849 --> 02:17:06.859 align:start position:0%
legislative proposals
 
02:17:09.669 --> 02:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
things that the the state could Advance
 
02:17:12.830 --> 02:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
legislatively which could help reduce
 
02:17:15.410 --> 02:17:15.420 align:start position:0%
prescription drug costs really more
 
02:17:18.190 --> 02:17:18.200 align:start position:0%
across the board which would help public
 
02:17:21.589 --> 02:17:21.599 align:start position:0%
purchasers as well of course so those
 
02:17:24.410 --> 02:17:24.420 align:start position:0%
strategies included things like looking
 
02:17:26.589 --> 02:17:26.599 align:start position:0%
at reference rates
 
02:17:29.929 --> 02:17:29.939 align:start position:0%
so for example looking to Canadian
 
02:17:34.089 --> 02:17:34.099 align:start position:0%
prices where drugs are much less costly
 
02:17:38.810 --> 02:17:38.820 align:start position:0%
and looking to those for setting payment
 
02:17:41.650 --> 02:17:41.660 align:start position:0%
rates for public purchasers in the state
 
02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:45.000 align:start position:0%
in order to essentially capture savings
 
02:17:46.969 --> 02:17:46.979 align:start position:0%
that might be available without having
 
02:17:48.589 --> 02:17:48.599 align:start position:0%
to establish an importation program
 
02:17:54.230 --> 02:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:55.910 --> 02:17:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:57.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:18:10.790 --> 02:18:10.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:13.009 --> 02:18:13.019 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman hunt and and
 
02:18:15.589 --> 02:18:15.599 align:start position:0%
committee members and thank you so much
 
02:18:19.790 --> 02:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
for this opportunity to testify
 
02:18:24.230 --> 02:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
um in very strong opposition to hb-130
 
02:18:27.049 --> 02:18:27.059 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a lot to add uh you've
 
02:18:28.969 --> 02:18:28.979 align:start position:0%
heard quite a lot of testimony already
 
02:18:32.330 --> 02:18:32.340 align:start position:0%
from technical experts
 
02:18:32.340 --> 02:18:34.070 align:start position:0%
from technical experts
um

02:18:34.070 --> 02:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:18:37.250 --> 02:18:37.260 align:start position:0%
and you know the ins and outs of the
 
02:18:38.929 --> 02:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
prescription drug affordability board
 
02:18:41.870 --> 02:18:41.880 align:start position:0%
and the law and the rules
 
02:18:43.370 --> 02:18:43.380 align:start position:0%
um one thing that we haven't talked
 
02:18:46.910 --> 02:18:46.920 align:start position:0%
about this this afternoon is how this
 
02:18:48.709 --> 02:18:48.719 align:start position:0%
affects human beings and that was
 
02:18:50.089 --> 02:18:50.099 align:start position:0%
something that I've been thinking about
 
02:18:52.730 --> 02:18:52.740 align:start position:0%
as I've you know heard us go back and
 
02:18:54.770 --> 02:18:54.780 align:start position:0%
forth about
 
02:18:57.770 --> 02:18:57.780 align:start position:0%
um you know the technical pieces
 
02:18:57.780 --> 02:18:58.370 align:start position:0%
um you know the technical pieces
um

02:18:58.370 --> 02:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:19:00.650 --> 02:19:00.660 align:start position:0%
so I moved back to New Hampshire to take
 
02:19:02.570 --> 02:19:02.580 align:start position:0%
care of my dad who had Parkinson's
 
02:19:05.030 --> 02:19:05.040 align:start position:0%
disease who since passed away and I was
 
02:19:07.150 --> 02:19:07.160 align:start position:0%
in a Parkinson's support group
 
02:19:10.969 --> 02:19:10.979 align:start position:0%
uh for caregivers and
 
02:19:13.669 --> 02:19:13.679 align:start position:0%
um someone in that group couldn't afford
 
02:19:16.009 --> 02:19:16.019 align:start position:0%
the Parkinson's medications and they had
 
02:19:18.530 --> 02:19:18.540 align:start position:0%
to sell their house
 
02:19:21.110 --> 02:19:21.120 align:start position:0%
um and move into Apartments so that they
 
02:19:24.290 --> 02:19:24.300 align:start position:0%
could you know keep their husband alive
 
02:19:27.230 --> 02:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
uh this morning I was at the doctor's
 
02:19:31.070 --> 02:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
office and she told me that we were
 
02:19:32.870 --> 02:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
talking about a prescription and she
 
02:19:35.150 --> 02:19:35.160 align:start position:0%
told me that oh well you know what it's
 
02:19:37.429 --> 02:19:37.439 align:start position:0%
very expensive but you know what a lot
 
02:19:39.830 --> 02:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
of my patients drive to Canada to get
 
02:19:41.509 --> 02:19:41.519 align:start position:0%
their drugs because it's only three
 
02:19:44.270 --> 02:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
hours away and it's about a tenth of the
 
02:19:46.669 --> 02:19:46.679 align:start position:0%
cost there
 
02:19:48.349 --> 02:19:48.359 align:start position:0%
um and
 
02:19:50.929 --> 02:19:50.939 align:start position:0%
also I live in Ossipee New Hampshire and
 
02:19:53.150 --> 02:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
I won't of course mention this person's
 
02:19:55.790 --> 02:19:55.800 align:start position:0%
name but I also know somebody who
 
02:19:58.730 --> 02:19:58.740 align:start position:0%
uh someone in town who
 
02:19:58.740 --> 02:19:59.690 align:start position:0%
uh someone in town who
um

02:19:59.690 --> 02:19:59.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:20:02.870 --> 02:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
had cancer and
 
02:20:06.230 --> 02:20:06.240 align:start position:0%
um both the medication and the cost of
 
02:20:08.389 --> 02:20:08.399 align:start position:0%
treatment he did not want this to be a
 
02:20:10.370 --> 02:20:10.380 align:start position:0%
burden on his children
 
02:20:12.650 --> 02:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
so he took his own life
 
02:20:15.590 --> 02:20:15.600 align:start position:0%
and so while we're debating the ins and
 
02:20:17.510 --> 02:20:17.520 align:start position:0%
outs and how much and
 
02:20:19.790 --> 02:20:19.800 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I love living in New
 
02:20:22.090 --> 02:20:22.100 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is because we do have
 
02:20:25.010 --> 02:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
accountability in government and we are
 
02:20:29.270 --> 02:20:29.280 align:start position:0%
so judicious in how we spend money and I
 
02:20:31.490 --> 02:20:31.500 align:start position:0%
think that's absolutely critical and
 
02:20:34.849 --> 02:20:34.859 align:start position:0%
it's a very well-run State and and the
 
02:20:36.950 --> 02:20:36.960 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire legislature does an
 
02:20:40.250 --> 02:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
amazing job of keeping costs down
 
02:20:42.590 --> 02:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
but the prescription drug affordability
 
02:20:45.889 --> 02:20:45.899 align:start position:0%
board not only has you know the
 
02:20:47.870 --> 02:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
possibility of
 
02:20:50.690 --> 02:20:50.700 align:start position:0%
you know life-changing I mean we also at
 
02:20:53.809 --> 02:20:53.819 align:start position:0%
AARP we collect a lot of stories from
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
um you know folks 55 and older and
 
02:21:00.710 --> 02:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
um we also have a lot of people who are
 
02:21:02.929 --> 02:21:02.939 align:start position:0%
struggling to afford their medication
 
02:21:04.790 --> 02:21:04.800 align:start position:0%
they're literally trying to make the
 
02:21:07.309 --> 02:21:07.319 align:start position:0%
decision do I eat or do I take my
 
02:21:10.429 --> 02:21:10.439 align:start position:0%
medication do I heat my house
 
02:21:13.790 --> 02:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
um so you know the prescription drug
 
02:21:16.070 --> 02:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
affordability board
 
02:21:18.110 --> 02:21:18.120 align:start position:0%
is a chance for
 
02:21:21.469 --> 02:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
us to have the possibility of bringing
 
02:21:25.070 --> 02:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
those drug prices down not only for
 
02:21:27.590 --> 02:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
people who have worked for the New
 
02:21:29.929 --> 02:21:29.939 align:start position:0%
Hampshire government but also for the
 
02:21:33.830 --> 02:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
state and yes there is uh an investment
 
02:21:38.210 --> 02:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
of hiring staff but I ask you to
 
02:21:41.809 --> 02:21:41.819 align:start position:0%
consider the potential cost savings for
 
02:21:45.710 --> 02:21:45.720 align:start position:0%
both the state and for our citizens
 
02:21:47.990 --> 02:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
um and thank you so much for your time I
 
02:21:49.730 --> 02:21:49.740 align:start position:0%
know this has been a very long hearing
 
02:21:52.910 --> 02:21:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I have one card left Jake
 
02:22:09.950 --> 02:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:22:11.870 --> 02:22:11.880 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman honorable
 
02:22:13.190 --> 02:22:13.200 align:start position:0%
members of the committee so nice to see
 
02:22:15.050 --> 02:22:15.060 align:start position:0%
you again again my name is Jake Berry
 
02:22:17.150 --> 02:22:17.160 align:start position:0%
I'm the vice president of policy at new
 
02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:19.140 align:start position:0%
Futures we're a non-partisan non-profit
 
02:22:20.870 --> 02:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
Health policy and advocacy organization
 
02:22:22.849 --> 02:22:22.859 align:start position:0%
I don't want to repeat too much of what
 
02:22:25.250 --> 02:22:25.260 align:start position:0%
has been said uh this afternoon I don't
 
02:22:26.570 --> 02:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
want to repeat too much of what I said
 
02:22:28.370 --> 02:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
last week but I do want to stress our
 
02:22:30.050 --> 02:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
strong opposition to this bill and our
 
02:22:31.250 --> 02:22:31.260 align:start position:0%
support for the prescription drug
 
02:22:34.130 --> 02:22:34.140 align:start position:0%
affordability board certainly as I said
 
02:22:35.690 --> 02:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
last week we are not against looking
 
02:22:37.250 --> 02:22:37.260 align:start position:0%
into redundancies we are not against
 
02:22:39.410 --> 02:22:39.420 align:start position:0%
looking into efficiencies what we're
 
02:22:40.790 --> 02:22:40.800 align:start position:0%
here to ask is that you keep the board
 
02:22:42.889 --> 02:22:42.899 align:start position:0%
in place you do not suspend it you do
 
02:22:44.510 --> 02:22:44.520 align:start position:0%
not repeal it that you allow it to
 
02:22:46.130 --> 02:22:46.140 align:start position:0%
continue to do its critical important
 
02:22:49.309 --> 02:22:49.319 align:start position:0%
work while you look into those matters
 
02:22:52.130 --> 02:22:52.140 align:start position:0%
um as as genso uh put so articulately
 
02:22:53.690 --> 02:22:53.700 align:start position:0%
there are people suffering in this state
 
02:22:55.610 --> 02:22:55.620 align:start position:0%
there are people who are rationing their
 
02:22:57.050 --> 02:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
medication who are not taking their
 
02:22:58.910 --> 02:22:58.920 align:start position:0%
medication who are having to make
 
02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
choices between uh home heat and and
 
02:23:03.889 --> 02:23:03.899 align:start position:0%
medication and yet we're here talking
 
02:23:05.570 --> 02:23:05.580 align:start position:0%
about doing away with a board that was
 
02:23:07.790 --> 02:23:07.800 align:start position:0%
founded with the intent to help reduce
 
02:23:10.910 --> 02:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
these uh to help reduce these costs it I
 
02:23:13.309 --> 02:23:13.319 align:start position:0%
I find it somewhat bewildering
 
02:23:16.250 --> 02:23:16.260 align:start position:0%
um so uh with that just know we ask you
 
02:23:18.110 --> 02:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
to uh last thing you'll notice Senator
 
02:23:21.050 --> 02:23:21.060 align:start position:0%
Sherman mentioned if there are ways that
 
02:23:23.030 --> 02:23:23.040 align:start position:0%
you can see to improve this board they
 
02:23:24.530 --> 02:23:24.540 align:start position:0%
would they would be all the years they
 
02:23:27.410 --> 02:23:27.420 align:start position:0%
were glad to work on SB 450 last year to
 
02:23:29.210 --> 02:23:29.220 align:start position:0%
strengthen the board to expand and to
 
02:23:31.370 --> 02:23:31.380 align:start position:0%
expand his work uh and I'm sure they
 
02:23:33.290 --> 02:23:33.300 align:start position:0%
would be glad to do so again but to uh
 
02:23:35.450 --> 02:23:35.460 align:start position:0%
to suspend or repeal the board at this
 
02:23:37.790 --> 02:23:37.800 align:start position:0%
point would uh to me seem misguided and
 
02:23:39.650 --> 02:23:39.660 align:start position:0%
would really negatively impact the the
 
02:23:41.090 --> 02:23:41.100 align:start position:0%
health of our state and with that I'm
 
02:23:44.090 --> 02:23:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
02:23:47.630 --> 02:23:47.640 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you uh I made a mistake
 
02:23:50.210 --> 02:23:50.220 align:start position:0%
there was one card hiding here
 
02:23:50.220 --> 02:23:51.410 align:start position:0%
there was one card hiding here
from

02:23:51.410 --> 02:23:51.420 align:start position:0%
from
 
02:23:56.469 --> 02:23:56.479 align:start position:0%

the prescription drug board on June 25th
 
02:24:36.290 --> 02:24:36.300 align:start position:0%
that system which has been in place
 
02:24:40.849 --> 02:24:40.859 align:start position:0%

Etc
 
02:24:56.330 --> 02:24:56.340 align:start position:0%
uh I would encourage you to look at
 
02:25:00.250 --> 02:25:00.260 align:start position:0%
appendix I to the
 
02:25:03.830 --> 02:25:03.840 align:start position:0%
2021 report of the prescription drug
 
02:25:05.870 --> 02:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
board and you'll see the entire
 
02:25:09.410 --> 02:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
presentation from the young man at HHS
 
02:25:13.309 --> 02:25:13.319 align:start position:0%
the second informational point is simply
 
02:25:13.319 --> 02:25:15.770 align:start position:0%
the second informational point is simply
the

02:25:15.770 --> 02:25:15.780 align:start position:0%

is based
 
02:25:39.230 --> 02:25:39.240 align:start position:0%
in large measure maybe you almost
 
02:25:42.710 --> 02:25:42.720 align:start position:0%
exclusively on this database that's been
 
02:25:46.730 --> 02:25:46.740 align:start position:0%
in existence since 2005. and if you look
 
02:25:49.849 --> 02:25:49.859 align:start position:0%
at that report you'll find it on the
 
02:25:51.950 --> 02:25:51.960 align:start position:0%
department's website or certainly I can
 
02:25:55.730 --> 02:25:55.740 align:start position:0%
give you a link at page 48
 
02:26:00.349 --> 02:26:00.359 align:start position:0%
you'll specifically find in its the
 
02:26:03.370 --> 02:26:03.380 align:start position:0%
reports treatment of prescription drugs
 
02:26:06.290 --> 02:26:06.300 align:start position:0%
that the information reported throughout
 
02:26:09.110 --> 02:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
the report is net
 
02:26:12.469 --> 02:26:12.479 align:start position:0%
of rebates and that the rebates for
 
02:26:14.450 --> 02:26:14.460 align:start position:0%
prescription drugs are paid by the
 
02:26:17.030 --> 02:26:17.040 align:start position:0%
manufacturers to the insurers and go to
 
02:26:20.349 --> 02:26:20.359 align:start position:0%
directly reduce the prescription cost
 
02:26:23.030 --> 02:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
that go into the health care
 
02:26:27.290 --> 02:26:27.300 align:start position:0%
so again you can find that at page 48
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
uh at the most recent report dated
 
02:26:32.330 --> 02:26:32.340 align:start position:0%
October 18th those are the two
 
02:26:34.309 --> 02:26:34.319 align:start position:0%
information points I wanted to share and
 
02:26:38.450 --> 02:26:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:44.090 --> 02:26:44.100 align:start position:0%

her for you
 
02:27:11.330 --> 02:27:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:13.429 --> 02:27:13.439 align:start position:0%
the information thank you the
 
02:27:16.550 --> 02:27:16.560 align:start position:0%
information that you indicated that you
 
02:27:19.969 --> 02:27:19.979 align:start position:0%
that is on that website were things like
 
02:27:22.309 --> 02:27:22.319 align:start position:0%
deductibles and payments and all that
 
02:27:24.410 --> 02:27:24.420 align:start position:0%
that stuff
 
02:27:27.950 --> 02:27:27.960 align:start position:0%
is doesn't sound to me anything like the
 
02:27:29.230 --> 02:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
kind of information
 
02:27:32.290 --> 02:27:32.300 align:start position:0%
that the pdab wants to get a hold of
 
02:27:36.349 --> 02:27:36.359 align:start position:0%
that's the so I'm asking the kind of
 
02:27:38.330 --> 02:27:38.340 align:start position:0%
things that they are asking for seem to
 
02:27:40.210 --> 02:27:40.220 align:start position:0%
be very different
 
02:27:43.190 --> 02:27:43.200 align:start position:0%
uh do you why do you think that they're
 
02:27:45.050 --> 02:27:45.060 align:start position:0%
the same because it doesn't seem to be
 
02:27:47.030 --> 02:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
the same at all you know wholesale
 
02:27:50.750 --> 02:27:50.760 align:start position:0%
prices Pharmacy prices Kickbacks to pdms
 
02:27:53.030 --> 02:27:53.040 align:start position:0%
all that kind of stuff that's not what
 
02:27:55.730 --> 02:27:55.740 align:start position:0%
you're listing as part of the insurance
 
02:27:55.740 --> 02:27:57.770 align:start position:0%
you're listing as part of the insurance
database

02:27:57.770 --> 02:27:57.780 align:start position:0%
database
 
02:28:00.469 --> 02:28:00.479 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for the question
 
02:28:02.270 --> 02:28:02.280 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I addressed that point
 
02:28:02.280 --> 02:28:03.110 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure I addressed that point
but

02:28:03.110 --> 02:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
but
 
02:28:06.070 --> 02:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
uh on that point
 
02:28:11.330 --> 02:28:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh I referred you to page 48 of the New
 
02:28:13.969 --> 02:28:13.979 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Insurance departments uh
 
02:28:16.429 --> 02:28:16.439 align:start position:0%
report of October 18th where they talk
 
02:28:20.270 --> 02:28:20.280 align:start position:0%
about the prescription drug data being
 
02:28:22.790 --> 02:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
net of rebates
 
02:28:25.070 --> 02:28:25.080 align:start position:0%
so there's some
 
02:28:28.849 --> 02:28:28.859 align:start position:0%
information in the system somewhere
 
02:28:31.610 --> 02:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
that confirms that the prices were
 
02:28:34.490 --> 02:28:34.500 align:start position:0%
reported as net of rebate exactly what
 
02:28:39.050 --> 02:28:39.060 align:start position:0%
 
02:28:41.870 --> 02:28:41.880 align:start position:0%

forward okay so
 
02:30:35.750 --> 02:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm introducing
 
02:30:38.389 --> 02:30:38.399 align:start position:0%
um HP 249 this is being done at the
 
02:30:40.370 --> 02:30:40.380 align:start position:0%
request of the insurance company as I
 
02:30:42.110 --> 02:30:42.120 align:start position:0%
said representative
 
02:30:44.210 --> 02:30:44.220 align:start position:0%
as I said representative Edwards is the
 
02:30:46.010 --> 02:30:46.020 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor
 
02:30:47.690 --> 02:30:47.700 align:start position:0%
um this bill will adopt the National
 
02:30:50.270 --> 02:30:50.280 align:start position:0%
Association of insurance Commissioners
 
02:30:52.910 --> 02:30:52.920 align:start position:0%
model law to establish regulatory
 
02:30:55.010 --> 02:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
standards for the pet insurance industry
 
02:30:57.770 --> 02:30:57.780 align:start position:0%
some elements of the model law address
 
02:31:00.650 --> 02:31:00.660 align:start position:0%
consumer protections pre-existing
 
02:31:03.349 --> 02:31:03.359 align:start position:0%

Producers I also just want to add that
 
02:31:10.730 --> 02:31:10.740 align:start position:0%
it was clarified to me that this isn't
 
02:31:12.290 --> 02:31:12.300 align:start position:0%
the kind of this isn't health insurance
 
02:31:14.870 --> 02:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
as we would think of a policy for itself
 
02:31:18.230 --> 02:31:18.240 align:start position:0%
it's it's considered um proper more of a
 
02:31:20.570 --> 02:31:20.580 align:start position:0%
property insurance although I would
 
02:31:23.030 --> 02:31:23.040 align:start position:0%
argue that my dog owns me I don't own
 
02:31:23.040 --> 02:31:24.240 align:start position:0%
argue that my dog owns me I don't own
him

02:31:24.240 --> 02:31:24.250 align:start position:0%
him
 
02:31:24.250 --> 02:31:24.710 align:start position:0%
him

02:31:24.710 --> 02:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:31:24.720 --> 02:31:25.610 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

02:31:25.610 --> 02:31:25.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:27.770 --> 02:31:27.780 align:start position:0%
uh some elements of the model law
 
02:31:29.809 --> 02:31:29.819 align:start position:0%
address uh consumer protections
 
02:31:32.030 --> 02:31:32.040 align:start position:0%
pre-existing conditions pet wellness
 
02:31:34.010 --> 02:31:34.020 align:start position:0%

02:31:35.809 --> 02:31:35.819 align:start position:0%
Insurance Producers
 
02:31:38.090 --> 02:31:38.100 align:start position:0%
um Deputy Commissioner DJ Bettencourt is
 
02:31:39.710 --> 02:31:39.720 align:start position:0%
here and he can give us some more
 
02:31:42.410 --> 02:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
complete understanding of the bill um
 
02:31:48.349 --> 02:31:48.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:31:50.690 --> 02:31:50.700 align:start position:0%
you all said Jess
 
02:31:54.710 --> 02:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
I I deferred because she's done more
 
02:31:56.630 --> 02:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
homework on this bill and I figured by
 
02:31:59.090 --> 02:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
now you'd be tired of me and unless
 
02:32:00.710 --> 02:32:00.720 align:start position:0%
representative Terry wants to talk about
 
02:32:05.330 --> 02:32:05.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:07.610 --> 02:32:07.620 align:start position:0%
uh memory questions from the committee
 
02:32:07.620 --> 02:32:12.170 align:start position:0%
uh memory questions from the committee
members

02:32:12.170 --> 02:32:12.180 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:15.349 --> 02:32:15.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:17.570 --> 02:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
so DJ
 
02:32:26.750 --> 02:32:26.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:28.490 --> 02:32:28.500 align:start position:0%
I was wondering why
 
02:32:31.250 --> 02:32:31.260 align:start position:0%
box was sticking around I always bring
 
02:32:36.290 --> 02:32:36.300 align:start position:0%
 
02:32:38.090 --> 02:32:38.100 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman members of
 
02:32:40.130 --> 02:32:40.140 align:start position:0%

02:32:41.990 --> 02:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
Bettencourt and I still have the
 
02:32:44.210 --> 02:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
pleasure of serving as the Deputy
 
02:32:45.110 --> 02:32:45.120 align:start position:0%
Commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
02:32:47.750 --> 02:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
insurance department I am joined this
 
02:32:49.670 --> 02:32:49.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon by two of my colleagues James
 
02:32:51.530 --> 02:32:51.540 align:start position:0%
Fox the head of our Property and
 
02:32:54.530 --> 02:32:54.540 align:start position:0%

legal beagle for the Property and
 
02:33:00.170 --> 02:33:00.180 align:start position:0%
Casualty department and we are excited
 
02:33:02.510 --> 02:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
to talk with you this afternoon about
 
02:33:05.389 --> 02:33:05.399 align:start position:0%
pet insurance in support of House Bill
 
02:33:07.630 --> 02:33:07.640 align:start position:0%
249 which the sponsors correctly
 
02:33:10.490 --> 02:33:10.500 align:start position:0%
indicated was at the request of the
 
02:33:10.500 --> 02:33:11.630 align:start position:0%
indicated was at the request of the
department

02:33:11.630 --> 02:33:11.640 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:33:15.050 --> 02:33:15.060 align:start position:0%
in 1982 the first pet insurance policy
 
02:33:16.969 --> 02:33:16.979 align:start position:0%
was sold in the United States
 
02:33:19.490 --> 02:33:19.500 align:start position:0%
and it was issued to
 
02:33:19.500 --> 02:33:21.410 align:start position:0%
and it was issued to
Lassie

02:33:21.410 --> 02:33:21.420 align:start position:0%
Lassie
 
02:33:23.929 --> 02:33:23.939 align:start position:0%
the television star yep it was issued to
 
02:33:26.210 --> 02:33:26.220 align:start position:0%
Lassie which one whether there are four
 
02:33:28.490 --> 02:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
of them uh 1982 I think that was
 
02:33:31.550 --> 02:33:31.560 align:start position:0%
probably a uh a later version of Lassie
 
02:33:34.190 --> 02:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
if you will but it was issued by the
 
02:33:36.650 --> 02:33:36.660 align:start position:0%
Veterinary Pet Insurance Company
 
02:33:38.630 --> 02:33:38.640 align:start position:0%
but since that time the pet insurance
 
02:33:41.690 --> 02:33:41.700 align:start position:0%
industry has exploded the North American
 
02:33:44.210 --> 02:33:44.220 align:start position:0%
Pet Health Insurance Association states
 
02:33:48.170 --> 02:33:48.180 align:start position:0%
that the industry exceeded 2.83 billion
 
02:33:50.809 --> 02:33:50.819 align:start position:0%
in written premium at the end of 2021
 
02:33:53.809 --> 02:33:53.819 align:start position:0%
and that industry has more than doubled
 
02:33:58.670 --> 02:33:58.680 align:start position:0%
between 2018 and 2022
 
02:34:01.010 --> 02:34:01.020 align:start position:0%
that same organization indicates that
 
02:34:01.020 --> 02:34:02.050 align:start position:0%
that same organization indicates that
over

02:34:02.050 --> 02:34:02.060 align:start position:0%
over
 
02:34:05.809 --> 02:34:05.819 align:start position:0%
4.41 million pets are currently insured
 
02:34:07.790 --> 02:34:07.800 align:start position:0%
across North America
 
02:34:10.490 --> 02:34:10.500 align:start position:0%
we are here today because while this
 
02:34:12.410 --> 02:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
Market is fairly new
 
02:34:15.650 --> 02:34:15.660 align:start position:0%
the regulatory framework around it from
 
02:34:19.070 --> 02:34:19.080 align:start position:0%
an insurance perspective is light
 
02:34:21.770 --> 02:34:21.780 align:start position:0%
in light of this explosive growth the
 
02:34:23.210 --> 02:34:23.220 align:start position:0%
National Association of insurance
 
02:34:24.770 --> 02:34:24.780 align:start position:0%
Commissioners which I talked a little
 
02:34:26.870 --> 02:34:26.880 align:start position:0%
bit about during our orientation a few
 
02:34:28.510 --> 02:34:28.520 align:start position:0%
weeks ago
 
02:34:31.490 --> 02:34:31.500 align:start position:0%
recognized the growing need for more
 
02:34:34.130 --> 02:34:34.140 align:start position:0%
standard and comprehensive pet insurance
 
02:34:34.140 --> 02:34:35.750 align:start position:0%
standard and comprehensive pet insurance
Frameworks

02:34:35.750 --> 02:34:35.760 align:start position:0%
Frameworks
 
02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:38.880 align:start position:0%
and so to that end the NAIC developed
 
02:34:42.770 --> 02:34:42.780 align:start position:0%
the 2022 pet insurance model Act
 
02:34:45.469 --> 02:34:45.479 align:start position:0%
and this legislation seeks to adopt that
 
02:34:48.530 --> 02:34:48.540 align:start position:0%
model act into New Hampshire law which
 
02:34:50.809 --> 02:34:50.819 align:start position:0%
will bring many of the same rules of the
 
02:34:53.630 --> 02:34:53.640 align:start position:0%
road in consumer protections that are in
 
02:34:57.530 --> 02:34:57.540 align:start position:0%
the insurance industry to pet insurance
 
02:34:59.450 --> 02:34:59.460 align:start position:0%
some of the key Provisions include
 
02:35:01.610 --> 02:35:01.620 align:start position:0%
detailed coverage definitions
 
02:35:04.969 --> 02:35:04.979 align:start position:0%
disclosures policy conditions sales for
 
02:35:07.670 --> 02:35:07.680 align:start position:0%
wellness programs best practices for
 
02:35:10.610 --> 02:35:10.620 align:start position:0%
insurance producer training related
 
02:35:13.790 --> 02:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
regulations and violations I want to
 
02:35:15.650 --> 02:35:15.660 align:start position:0%
pause here to highlight something that
 
02:35:17.570 --> 02:35:17.580 align:start position:0%
representative Burroughs mentioned in
 
02:35:19.610 --> 02:35:19.620 align:start position:0%
her testimony which is really important
 
02:35:22.610 --> 02:35:22.620 align:start position:0%
this is a property in casualty product
 
02:35:25.130 --> 02:35:25.140 align:start position:0%
it is not a health product
 
02:35:28.070 --> 02:35:28.080 align:start position:0%
though you could easily be forgiven for
 
02:35:30.469 --> 02:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
being mistaken because so many aspects
 
02:35:32.990 --> 02:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
of pet insurance resemble
 
02:35:35.929 --> 02:35:35.939 align:start position:0%
what health insurance looks like for all
 
02:35:38.809 --> 02:35:38.819 align:start position:0%
of us things like networks and what
 
02:35:40.910 --> 02:35:40.920 align:start position:0%
types of visits are covered and not
 
02:35:44.150 --> 02:35:44.160 align:start position:0%
covered things of that nature however at
 
02:35:46.250 --> 02:35:46.260 align:start position:0%
the end of the day these Provisions
 
02:35:48.969 --> 02:35:48.979 align:start position:0%
would sit in our property in casualty
 
02:35:53.030 --> 02:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
statutes and again that is no insult to
 
02:35:56.030 --> 02:35:56.040 align:start position:0%
the animal lovers Among Us trust me my
 
02:35:59.929 --> 02:35:59.939 align:start position:0%
family much prefers our pets over me
 
02:36:02.990 --> 02:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
so I am not offended by that but the way
 
02:36:05.150 --> 02:36:05.160 align:start position:0%
this works and the law is pets are
 
02:36:08.210 --> 02:36:08.220 align:start position:0%
property so it will be in the p and C
 
02:36:10.370 --> 02:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
Realm of the statute
 
02:36:13.130 --> 02:36:13.140 align:start position:0%
moving on a specific requirements so
 
02:36:14.330 --> 02:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
again I'm going back to some of the
 
02:36:16.190 --> 02:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
highlights of the bill specific
 
02:36:18.110 --> 02:36:18.120 align:start position:0%
requirements that apply to pet insurance
 
02:36:20.389 --> 02:36:20.399 align:start position:0%
policies regarding how the product may
 
02:36:23.570 --> 02:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
be sold solicited negotiated or offered
 
02:36:24.830 --> 02:36:24.840 align:start position:0%
in the state
 
02:36:27.469 --> 02:36:27.479 align:start position:0%
compliance standards for policies or
 
02:36:29.330 --> 02:36:29.340 align:start position:0%
certificates of insurance
 
02:36:31.849 --> 02:36:31.859 align:start position:0%
at the same time the ACT still provides
 
02:36:33.950 --> 02:36:33.960 align:start position:0%
considerable flexibility for the
 
02:36:35.929 --> 02:36:35.939 align:start position:0%
industry to Fashion products that are
 
02:36:38.210 --> 02:36:38.220 align:start position:0%
diverse and attentive to the needs of
 
02:36:40.730 --> 02:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
consumers for example
 
02:36:43.250 --> 02:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
insurers may include premium savings
 
02:36:45.830 --> 02:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
conditions such as yearly or lifetime
 
02:36:49.190 --> 02:36:49.200 align:start position:0%
limits in exclusions such as different
 
02:36:51.110 --> 02:36:51.120 align:start position:0%
kinds of veterinary services or
 
02:36:53.389 --> 02:36:53.399 align:start position:0%
veterinary services rendered outside of
 
02:36:55.190 --> 02:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
the United States
 
02:36:57.290 --> 02:36:57.300 align:start position:0%
another key provision applies to
 
02:36:57.300 --> 02:36:58.670 align:start position:0%
another key provision applies to
licensing

02:36:58.670 --> 02:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
licensing
 
02:37:01.309 --> 02:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
so training and Licensing of producers
 
02:37:03.230 --> 02:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
is required within the insurance
 
02:37:06.530 --> 02:37:06.540 align:start position:0%
industry and pet insurance should be no
 
02:37:08.690 --> 02:37:08.700 align:start position:0%
different in that regard and so section
 
02:37:11.630 --> 02:37:11.640 align:start position:0%
7 of the model X spells out the
 
02:37:13.790 --> 02:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
licensing requirements for producers who
 
02:37:16.610 --> 02:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
sell pet insurance and the topics that
 
02:37:18.830 --> 02:37:18.840 align:start position:0%
must be included in that training
 
02:37:21.110 --> 02:37:21.120 align:start position:0%
required for licensing and the reason
 
02:37:22.849 --> 02:37:22.859 align:start position:0%
why that is important is because many
 
02:37:25.730 --> 02:37:25.740 align:start position:0%
states have reciprocity for producers
 
02:37:28.309 --> 02:37:28.319 align:start position:0%
when training requirements are similar
 
02:37:32.030 --> 02:37:32.040 align:start position:0%
and this would allow that to happen here
 
02:37:34.490 --> 02:37:34.500 align:start position:0%
in the in the model Act
 
02:37:36.530 --> 02:37:36.540 align:start position:0%
we are happy to take your questions of
 
02:37:38.150 --> 02:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
course but I would say in conclusion
 
02:37:41.030 --> 02:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
that as the model act worked its way
 
02:37:44.030 --> 02:37:44.040 align:start position:0%
through the NAIC process and it is a
 
02:37:46.610 --> 02:37:46.620 align:start position:0%
very long process I'm sure chairman hunt
 
02:37:48.710 --> 02:37:48.720 align:start position:0%
over the years has seen a few of these
 
02:37:50.870 --> 02:37:50.880 align:start position:0%
model acts come through they're few and
 
02:37:53.090 --> 02:37:53.100 align:start position:0%
far between because the process involved
 
02:37:55.309 --> 02:37:55.319 align:start position:0%
is very very long
 
02:37:57.889 --> 02:37:57.899 align:start position:0%
but because it brings together a wide
 
02:38:00.590 --> 02:38:00.600 align:start position:0%
diversity of stakeholders so folks like
 
02:38:03.469 --> 02:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
folks like ourselves folks in the
 
02:38:06.290 --> 02:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
industry as well as many other
 
02:38:08.809 --> 02:38:08.819 align:start position:0%
stakeholders they all have an
 
02:38:11.510 --> 02:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
opportunity to come to the table and to
 
02:38:13.670 --> 02:38:13.680 align:start position:0%
have their perspective heard as these
 
02:38:16.670 --> 02:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
model acts are formed and so that was
 
02:38:18.349 --> 02:38:18.359 align:start position:0%
certainly the process that was followed
 
02:38:20.570 --> 02:38:20.580 align:start position:0%
here James do you recall when they
 
02:38:23.889 --> 02:38:23.899 align:start position:0%
started to put together the model Act
 
02:38:26.690 --> 02:38:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure but I I'm pretty
 
02:38:28.670 --> 02:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
sure it's been a couple of years at
 
02:38:30.830 --> 02:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
least yeah that's consistent two to
 
02:38:33.110 --> 02:38:33.120 align:start position:0%
three years is my recollection of it
 
02:38:34.490 --> 02:38:34.500 align:start position:0%
that it took for this to come together
 
02:38:37.010 --> 02:38:37.020 align:start position:0%
so again it's a very thorough process
 
02:38:39.170 --> 02:38:39.180 align:start position:0%
that brings all of the parties to the
 
02:38:39.180 --> 02:38:40.250 align:start position:0%
that brings all of the parties to the
table

02:38:40.250 --> 02:38:40.260 align:start position:0%
table
 
02:38:42.110 --> 02:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
so in conclusion Mr chairman we believe
 
02:38:43.790 --> 02:38:43.800 align:start position:0%
that this model act strikes the
 
02:38:45.710 --> 02:38:45.720 align:start position:0%
appropriate balance between limiting
 
02:38:48.889 --> 02:38:48.899 align:start position:0%
regulation while also ensuring that when
 
02:38:51.230 --> 02:38:51.240 align:start position:0%
a consumer has a problem with their
 
02:38:53.750 --> 02:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
policy that our consumer division has
 
02:38:55.849 --> 02:38:55.859 align:start position:0%
the tools necessary to assist the
 
02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
consumer as we do with all other
 
02:39:00.950 --> 02:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
insurance products so I'll pause for a
 
02:39:02.389 --> 02:39:02.399 align:start position:0%
moment to turn to my colleagues to see
 
02:39:03.770 --> 02:39:03.780 align:start position:0%
if I've missed anything
 
02:39:05.510 --> 02:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
they tell me no
 
02:39:06.950 --> 02:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
so I'll turn it back over to you Mr
 
02:39:06.960 --> 02:39:08.929 align:start position:0%
so I'll turn it back over to you Mr
chairman

02:39:08.929 --> 02:39:08.939 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
02:39:10.610 --> 02:39:10.620 align:start position:0%
okay you have any questions
 
02:39:14.330 --> 02:39:14.340 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:15.889 --> 02:39:15.899 align:start position:0%
um yeah I'm just I'm just curious so
 
02:39:18.650 --> 02:39:18.660 align:start position:0%
right now there's no regulation on pet
 
02:39:20.690 --> 02:39:20.700 align:start position:0%
insurance at all is that correct
 
02:39:22.910 --> 02:39:22.920 align:start position:0%
well I wouldn't say no regulation at all
 
02:39:25.490 --> 02:39:25.500 align:start position:0%
they're obviously still applies the
 
02:39:28.550 --> 02:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
consumer protection act Provisions but
 
02:39:30.770 --> 02:39:30.780 align:start position:0%
as it pertains to the particular
 
02:39:33.170 --> 02:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
nuances and and facets of pet insurance
 
02:39:35.570 --> 02:39:35.580 align:start position:0%
I think that's an accurate statement
 
02:39:38.870 --> 02:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so yeah you got to speak to them
 
02:39:41.090 --> 02:39:41.100 align:start position:0%
like really yeah
 
02:39:43.429 --> 02:39:43.439 align:start position:0%
as the Deputy Commissioner stated uh the
 
02:39:45.290 --> 02:39:45.300 align:start position:0%
unusual nature of this is that it is
 
02:39:46.730 --> 02:39:46.740 align:start position:0%
property Casualty Insurance the way
 
02:39:48.830 --> 02:39:48.840 align:start position:0%
we're looking at it and all our property
 
02:39:52.070 --> 02:39:52.080 align:start position:0%
casually statues to do apply uh but it's
 
02:39:53.570 --> 02:39:53.580 align:start position:0%
a little odd because it's it's you have
 
02:39:55.849 --> 02:39:55.859 align:start position:0%
your your animal which is the property
 
02:39:57.889 --> 02:39:57.899 align:start position:0%
but then underneath that um the
 
02:39:59.510 --> 02:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
insurance companies have put basically a
 
02:40:02.450 --> 02:40:02.460 align:start position:0%
health insurance program so obviously in
 
02:40:04.429 --> 02:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
in our PNC statutes we don't have a lot
 
02:40:06.110 --> 02:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
of discussion of Wellness programs
 
02:40:08.570 --> 02:40:08.580 align:start position:0%
because it's not a part of PNC so we had
 
02:40:11.349 --> 02:40:11.359 align:start position:0%
to in essence take those minimum
 
02:40:13.370 --> 02:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
requirements that we wanted and the
 
02:40:15.110 --> 02:40:15.120 align:start position:0%
industry wanted and the consumer the
 
02:40:17.090 --> 02:40:17.100 align:start position:0%
consumers wanted the center for economic
 
02:40:19.070 --> 02:40:19.080 align:start position:0%
Justice is also also at the table and
 
02:40:21.170 --> 02:40:21.180 align:start position:0%
basically layer that into a p to a
 
02:40:22.610 --> 02:40:22.620 align:start position:0%
property casually statute so now you
 
02:40:23.870 --> 02:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
have all the property casualty
 
02:40:26.330 --> 02:40:26.340 align:start position:0%
protections and protections that are
 
02:40:27.590 --> 02:40:27.600 align:start position:0%
mimicking health insurance type
 
02:40:29.210 --> 02:40:29.220 align:start position:0%
protections which we've never had before
 
02:40:31.250 --> 02:40:31.260 align:start position:0%
so without those it would be difficult
 
02:40:34.190 --> 02:40:34.200 align:start position:0%
to say no to a form so this will bring
 
02:40:36.410 --> 02:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
consistency among all the 50 states when
 
02:40:38.030 --> 02:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
it's passed by all the states
 
02:40:40.010 --> 02:40:40.020 align:start position:0%
of one follow-up for the question you
 
02:40:42.290 --> 02:40:42.300 align:start position:0%
mean Clark I'm just curious so what
 
02:40:45.410 --> 02:40:45.420 align:start position:0%
happens now like if I had an issue like
 
02:40:48.469 --> 02:40:48.479 align:start position:0%
how do you guys just guess or is I mean
 
02:40:50.150 --> 02:40:50.160 align:start position:0%
there must be some what's the process
 
02:40:51.830 --> 02:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
now if I have so the problem I'd come to
 
02:40:54.230 --> 02:40:54.240 align:start position:0%
you the process now would be we we would
 
02:40:56.630 --> 02:40:56.640 align:start position:0%
review the review the form that's the
 
02:40:58.969 --> 02:40:58.979 align:start position:0%
first part and we apply all the PNC
 
02:41:01.670 --> 02:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
standards to it and then and we'd have
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
the the uh the companies kind of company
 
02:41:06.590 --> 02:41:06.600 align:start position:0%
by company Patchwork putting their their
 
02:41:08.450 --> 02:41:08.460 align:start position:0%
health insurance in essence a health
 
02:41:09.830 --> 02:41:09.840 align:start position:0%
insurance type standards in for
 
02:41:13.309 --> 02:41:13.319 align:start position:0%
pre-existing injury Wellness programs
 
02:41:15.469 --> 02:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
um things that we don't usually do
 
02:41:17.870 --> 02:41:17.880 align:start position:0%
um waiting periods for health uh and
 
02:41:20.090 --> 02:41:20.100 align:start position:0%
then we would have to on a case-by-case
 
02:41:22.250 --> 02:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
basis uh the commissioner would have to
 
02:41:24.770 --> 02:41:24.780 align:start position:0%
in essence assert uh individual
 
02:41:27.530 --> 02:41:27.540 align:start position:0%
determinations he's making uh on what's
 
02:41:29.450 --> 02:41:29.460 align:start position:0%
in the public interest uh in terms of
 
02:41:32.270 --> 02:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
blocking things so in this if you have a
 
02:41:34.250 --> 02:41:34.260 align:start position:0%
statute like the model then you don't
 
02:41:35.990 --> 02:41:36.000 align:start position:0%
have to worry about just apply the model
 
02:41:38.210 --> 02:41:38.220 align:start position:0%
and all 50 Commissioners have spoken
 
02:41:39.889 --> 02:41:39.899 align:start position:0%
about the model okay thank you
 
02:41:43.250 --> 02:41:43.260 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs thank you
 
02:41:48.830 --> 02:41:48.840 align:start position:0%
um if enacted uh what effect if any uh
 
02:41:51.410 --> 02:41:51.420 align:start position:0%
would this bill have on existing pet
 
02:41:54.050 --> 02:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
insurance policies and if there would be
 
02:41:58.250 --> 02:41:58.260 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:01.130 --> 02:42:01.140 align:start position:0%
um I I would say uh it would have
 
02:42:03.710 --> 02:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
um some some effects on in essence
 
02:42:05.990 --> 02:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
bringing all of the different uh pet
 
02:42:07.790 --> 02:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
insurance policies into alignment with
 
02:42:09.590 --> 02:42:09.600 align:start position:0%
each other so it would be Apples to
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
Apples but again this is the minimum
 
02:42:14.570 --> 02:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
requirement so you know our statutes are
 
02:42:16.969 --> 02:42:16.979 align:start position:0%
not running industry we're saying these
 
02:42:18.590 --> 02:42:18.600 align:start position:0%
are the minimum things we'd like to see
 
02:42:20.990 --> 02:42:21.000 align:start position:0%
in a pet insurance policy to protect
 
02:42:24.650 --> 02:42:24.660 align:start position:0%
consumers if one insurance carrier wants
 
02:42:26.630 --> 02:42:26.640 align:start position:0%
to go above that and provide more that
 
02:42:28.429 --> 02:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
that's fine but these are the minimums
 
02:42:30.469 --> 02:42:30.479 align:start position:0%
we want to see like we want a 30-day
 
02:42:32.750 --> 02:42:32.760 align:start position:0%
waiting period we want to only have one
 
02:42:34.190 --> 02:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
pre-existing period so you have a
 
02:42:36.290 --> 02:42:36.300 align:start position:0%
pre-existing injury in your animal in
 
02:42:38.929 --> 02:42:38.939 align:start position:0%
the once it's basically once you get an
 
02:42:40.849 --> 02:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
event to sign off on the animal and the
 
02:42:42.830 --> 02:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
after the first policy there's no
 
02:42:45.290 --> 02:42:45.300 align:start position:0%
pre-existing policy after policy because
 
02:42:47.630 --> 02:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
in PNC land we think of policies as
 
02:42:49.610 --> 02:42:49.620 align:start position:0%
one-year contracts it's not quite like
 
02:42:51.110 --> 02:42:51.120 align:start position:0%
health insurance it's more of a benefits
 
02:42:52.730 --> 02:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
program so to bring all of those
 
02:42:54.349 --> 02:42:54.359 align:start position:0%
minimums together all of the insurance
 
02:42:56.270 --> 02:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
companies now have to adhere to those
 
02:42:57.889 --> 02:42:57.899 align:start position:0%
and we can enforce those whether up
 
02:42:59.690 --> 02:42:59.700 align:start position:0%
front or on the back end but all the
 
02:43:01.010 --> 02:43:01.020 align:start position:0%
bells and whistles above that they can
 
02:43:02.990 --> 02:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
do what they want to uh further in quick
 
02:43:06.050 --> 02:43:06.060 align:start position:0%
further further inquiry thank you
 
02:43:06.060 --> 02:43:07.190 align:start position:0%
further further inquiry thank you
um

02:43:07.190 --> 02:43:07.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:43:08.690 --> 02:43:08.700 align:start position:0%
but if
 
02:43:11.150 --> 02:43:11.160 align:start position:0%
an existing policy did not meet the
 
02:43:12.710 --> 02:43:12.720 align:start position:0%
minimum requirements what would the
 
02:43:14.690 --> 02:43:14.700 align:start position:0%
effect be oh well that would be an
 
02:43:18.050 --> 02:43:18.060 align:start position:0%
illegal policy then have to refile it
 
02:43:20.210 --> 02:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
representative Emin
 
02:43:21.590 --> 02:43:21.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:24.000 align:start position:0%
our questions I don't see a fiscal note
 
02:43:26.510 --> 02:43:26.520 align:start position:0%
in the bill could you just go over uh
 
02:43:28.309 --> 02:43:28.319 align:start position:0%
resource requirements within the
 
02:43:31.070 --> 02:43:31.080 align:start position:0%
department needed to facilitate this and
 
02:43:36.550 --> 02:43:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:38.990 --> 02:43:39.000 align:start position:0%
so the apartment's already designed to
 
02:43:42.050 --> 02:43:42.060 align:start position:0%
to do everything that in this area of
 
02:43:43.550 --> 02:43:43.560 align:start position:0%
insurance already exists so we'll be
 
02:43:45.170 --> 02:43:45.180 align:start position:0%
doing exactly what we've been doing with
 
02:43:47.030 --> 02:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
the exact same people there's no added
 
02:43:47.040 --> 02:43:50.450 align:start position:0%
the exact same people there's no added
cost

02:43:50.450 --> 02:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:53.510 --> 02:43:53.520 align:start position:0%
okay I I must say that reading this
 
02:43:55.730 --> 02:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
through it's kind of um kind of
 
02:43:57.950 --> 02:43:57.960 align:start position:0%
entertaining uh but I did see that there
 
02:44:00.410 --> 02:44:00.420 align:start position:0%
there will be no wellness program many
 
02:44:02.990 --> 02:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
going forward so so there's no manage
 
02:44:05.690 --> 02:44:05.700 align:start position:0%
care here there's no managed care and we
 
02:44:09.290 --> 02:44:09.300 align:start position:0%
have no guaranteed procedures but I was
 
02:44:10.849 --> 02:44:10.859 align:start position:0%
thinking that it it's sort of like if
 
02:44:12.410 --> 02:44:12.420 align:start position:0%
anybody wanted to know what health
 
02:44:14.110 --> 02:44:14.120 align:start position:0%
insurance looked like in New Hampshire
 
02:44:17.210 --> 02:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
prior to 7-Eleven before prior to the
 
02:44:19.370 --> 02:44:19.380 align:start position:0%
Affordable Care Act this is it this is
 
02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
exactly what we were overturning way
 
02:44:24.910 --> 02:44:24.920 align:start position:0%
back then so
 
02:44:27.590 --> 02:44:27.600 align:start position:0%
all right see none thank you very much
 
02:44:27.600 --> 02:44:32.570 align:start position:0%
all right see none thank you very much
guys

02:44:32.570 --> 02:44:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
having no more cards and no more
 
02:44:39.110 --> 02:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
questions I guess we can
 
02:44:40.610 --> 02:44:40.620 align:start position:0%
you sure you didn't want to share you're
 
02:44:43.190 --> 02:44:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:45.290 --> 02:44:45.300 align:start position:0%
okay we're all set we will close the
 
02:44:47.330 --> 02:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
public hearing
