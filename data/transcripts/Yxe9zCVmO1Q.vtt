addressing your initial question or um
 
00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
request for a highlevel brief overview
 
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
of what this program would
 
00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 align:start position:0%
do so State uh Employee Assistance
 
00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 align:start position:0%
programs are really designed to support
 
00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
employees with whatever challenges that
 
00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 align:start position:0%
they may be dealing with in the uh in
 
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
the workplace or even outside of the
 
00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 align:start position:0%
workplace it's not intended to be
 
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 align:start position:0%
long-term Services they're brief in
 
00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:10.479 align:start position:0%
nature um uh there can be an educational
 
00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 align:start position:0%
component but for the most part what it
 
00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 align:start position:0%
really entails in brief is an assessment
 
00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
of some of the challenges that the
 
00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 align:start position:0%
individual is dealing with maybe some
 
00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 align:start position:0%
resources or connecting with resources
 
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 align:start position:0%
areas in in the corporate world um the
 
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 align:start position:0%
other thing that I think happened in uh
 
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 align:start position:0%
Employee Assistance programs it was also
 
00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
um gave some insight into um the Health
 
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 align:start position:0%
and Welfare of the workforce and if
 
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 align:start position:0%
there were unusual stresses building in
 
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 align:start position:0%
the aggregate to inform management that
 
00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:51.920 align:start position:0%
there may be some systemic issues that
 
00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:55.040 align:start position:0%
would should be addressed does does our
 
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
state EAP do anything like that our our
 
00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
EAP is really a robust program program
 
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.320 align:start position:0%
in that it works with individuals with
 
00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
their individual needs but there are
 
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
also places for workplace
 
00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 align:start position:0%
interventions um work culture audits
 
00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 align:start position:0%
just a variety of supports and services
 
00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 align:start position:0%
to impact the employee health and
 
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 align:start position:0%
wellness as you mentioned but also in
 
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 align:start position:0%
some circumstances dependent on how the
 
00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 align:start position:0%
ask comes in because it really holds the
 
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of each individual
 
00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 align:start position:0%
accessing our services but in some
 
00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
instances those asks are directly
 
00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 align:start position:0%
related to the workplace and so in that
 
00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 align:start position:0%
way the recommendation would be for the
 
00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
workplace all right thank you I'm I'm
 
00:02:36.509 --> 00:02:36.519 align:start position:0%
not sure I phrase my question properly
 
00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 align:start position:0%
what I'm looking for is whether or not
 
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
our EAP summarizes the aggregate overall
 
00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
Health and Welfare of the of the the
 
00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 align:start position:0%
body to provide overall situational
 
00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 align:start position:0%
awareness of course individual privacy
 
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 align:start position:0%
is maintained but if there are some
 
00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 align:start position:0%
general Workforce trends that are of
 
00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 align:start position:0%
Interest is that something that is
 
00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 align:start position:0%
separately called out and
 
00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 align:start position:0%
reported we're moving to a data
 
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
management system that's just been
 
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
approved and that's going to allow us to
 
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 align:start position:0%
see in a larger way Trends impacting the
 
00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 align:start position:0%
overall uh functioning in in departments
 
00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 align:start position:0%
for now the way those requests have been
 
00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 align:start position:0%
handled is on a case-by Case basis a
 
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:24.080 align:start position:0%
department by Department basis all right
 
00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 align:start position:0%
uh are there are there any questions
 
00:03:28.429 --> 00:03:28.439 align:start position:0%
representative Mooney thank you and
 
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for being here today
 
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:33.560 align:start position:0%
so in the methodology of the fiscal note
 
00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 align:start position:0%
it mentions per person cost Etc does
 
00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 align:start position:0%
this bill mean that it's entering a
 
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 align:start position:0%
scenario whereby there's a per person
 
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 align:start position:0%
cost for all 424 legislators even though
 
00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 align:start position:0%
maybe 50 would use the service is that
 
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 align:start position:0%
how I'm reading this that is correct the
 
00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:53.840 align:start position:0%
cost allocation formula the the number
 
00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 align:start position:0%
is low per per per
 
00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
person taking into account that fact
 
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 align:start position:0%
that not all 400 124 would likely
 
00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 align:start position:0%
utilize it but I would also add that
 
00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 align:start position:0%
that also um brings into the ability of
 
00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:09.360 align:start position:0%
each legislator if if it were to pass
 
00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 align:start position:0%
members of the household would also be
 
00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680 align:start position:0%
resource okay that was really a great
 
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 align:start position:0%
detail because that had eluded me that
 
00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 align:start position:0%
family members are eligible to use the
 
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
EAP as well if the benefit is provided
 
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
okay a question
 
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 align:start position:0%
yes uh thank you for coming and thanks
 
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so the the 38
 
00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 align:start position:0%
if if nobody used it would we pay
 
00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
zero or or we pay a fixed amount per
 
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 align:start position:0%
person regardless of whether so that's
 
00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 align:start position:0%
what you were saying there okay um uh do
 
00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 align:start position:0%
you take into account that that you know
 
00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of legislator have uh EAP programs
 
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
through their primary employment outside
 
00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 align:start position:0%
of the legislature and is that something
 
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 align:start position:0%
that we should take into account in
 
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:06.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 align:start position:0%
program my stance on that question is
 
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
that I you know I want to be able to
 
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
provide resources to folks who are in
 
00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:15.800 align:start position:0%
need of resources and I think that the
 
00:05:18.309 --> 00:05:18.319 align:start position:0%
cost allocation formula speaks to kind
 
00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:20.319 align:start position:0%
of the financial commitment I would
 
00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
never stare anybody away from resources
 
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 align:start position:0%
they may already have but I also know
 
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 align:start position:0%
that we have a robust resource program
 
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:27.600 align:start position:0%
for state employees and folks who
 
00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 align:start position:0%
contract and their family members
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
followup yeah so is is this rate the
 
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 align:start position:0%
same as for full-time employees of the
 
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:39.400 align:start position:0%
company of of of the state I mean yes
 
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.990 align:start position:0%
company of of of the state I mean yes
thank

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
thank
 
00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:43.479 align:start position:0%
you is is there another amendment that
 
00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 align:start position:0%
you know of floating around on this I I
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
I I'm I'm curious if we have a couple
 
00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 align:start position:0%
other Provisions uh one can a legislator
 
00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 align:start position:0%
opt out so that they aren't included in
 
00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 align:start position:0%
the in the aggregate cost to the
 
00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 align:start position:0%
speaker's office and is there a way to
 
00:06:06.309 --> 00:06:06.319 align:start position:0%
get the legislature legislator to
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
contribute to their own benefit much
 
00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
like they do on the dental program is
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
there an amendment floating around that
 
00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:16.120 align:start position:0%
I just don't know about um chairman
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
Edwards there was a discussion when the
 
00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 align:start position:0%
bill was before the policy Committee in
 
00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:22.280 align:start position:0%
legislative Administration it didn't
 
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
actually materialize in an amendment but
 
00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 align:start position:0%
what they did clarify from their
 
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
discussions were to uh uh suggest an
 
00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:32.199 align:start position:0%
amendment to include household members
 
00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 align:start position:0%
so that it actually would be in the
 
00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:36.120 align:start position:0%
language of the bill itself was one of
 
00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 align:start position:0%
the provisions and another issue that
 
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
they had discussed was to identify
 
00:06:42.029 --> 00:06:42.039 align:start position:0%
specifically that legislators were not
 
00:06:43.589 --> 00:06:43.599 align:start position:0%
employees for purposes or to be
 
00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 align:start position:0%
construed as employees for purposes of
 
00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:48.160 align:start position:0%
this this act there was a conversation
 
00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:49.680 align:start position:0%
in front of the with the policy
 
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:51.400 align:start position:0%
committee regarding exactly what you're
 
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
you're discussing which is the current
 
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 align:start position:0%
um provision for a dental benefit which
 
00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 align:start position:0%
a legislator can on their own uh seek
 
00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:01.960 align:start position:0%
and pay out of pocket for for those
 
00:07:05.749 --> 00:07:05.759 align:start position:0%
benefits um given the current model that
 
00:07:08.029 --> 00:07:08.039 align:start position:0%
we have for the employee assistance
 
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:10.680 align:start position:0%
program which is based upon the total
 
00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:14.560 align:start position:0%
number of employees from a specific um
 
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:17.240 align:start position:0%
um state agency um that participates in
 
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.360 align:start position:0%
it that if we went to a different type
 
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:23.360 align:start position:0%
of model like a u u individual pay model
 
00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:25.360 align:start position:0%
it would be uh it would lack parity with
 
00:07:26.909 --> 00:07:26.919 align:start position:0%
the other Provisions that we already
 
00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 align:start position:0%
have out there uh and it could run
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
contrary contrary to the funding
 
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
necessary to actually achieve the good
 
00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:36.280 align:start position:0%
works they do at the EAP if you change
 
00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:38.319 align:start position:0%
the funding model from that which has
 
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:40.560 align:start position:0%
already been in place for many many
 
00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:43.039 align:start position:0%
years uh as it relates to our um
 
00:07:45.749 --> 00:07:45.759 align:start position:0%
memorandum of agreements and with um
 
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
various state agencies I was going to
 
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.120 align:start position:0%
ask Mr Lawless if he thinks he could
 
00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:51.000 align:start position:0%
condense it down to less words but I
 
00:07:54.149 --> 00:07:54.159 align:start position:0%
think that that's hopefully as is um a
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
response to your your ultimate question
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
so summary is there's not an amendment
 
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:01.800 align:start position:0%
that came from all those discussions but
 
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
there were a lot of discussions in that
 
00:08:06.350 --> 00:08:06.360 align:start position:0%
area and and and because we're on the
 
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.400 align:start position:0%
I'm going to come to you in second uh do
 
00:08:11.589 --> 00:08:11.599 align:start position:0%
we have an an amendment on the timeline
 
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
that I had asked for yes can we go ahead
 
00:08:16.749 --> 00:08:16.759 align:start position:0%
and hand that out and make sure people
 
00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.520 align:start position:0%
are aware of it and then U I'll I'll I I
 
00:08:22.309 --> 00:08:22.319 align:start position:0%
saw representative hle first and then
 
00:08:24.029 --> 00:08:24.039 align:start position:0%
I'll go to representative
 
00:08:26.469 --> 00:08:26.479 align:start position:0%
wer thank you Mr Williams for the
 
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.680 align:start position:0%
discussion The Current Dental employment
 
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:31.640 align:start position:0%
benefit that is available to the
 
00:08:34.630 --> 00:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
legislature and in the past when I was a
 
00:08:37.029 --> 00:08:37.039 align:start position:0%
rep I took advantage of that we paid for
 
00:08:39.149 --> 00:08:39.159 align:start position:0%
that a benefit out of
 
00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:42.919 align:start position:0%
pocket and my understanding of Cobra
 
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:45.720 align:start position:0%
laws allowed for that to continue as
 
00:08:48.949 --> 00:08:48.959 align:start position:0%
well one does this if this benefit is
 
00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.040 align:start position:0%
created and an employee leaves right A
 
00:08:53.949 --> 00:08:53.959 align:start position:0%
legislature chooses not to file to run
 
00:08:57.350 --> 00:08:57.360 align:start position:0%
for reelection or chooses to write or
 
00:09:00.430 --> 00:09:00.440 align:start position:0%
does not win an elected seat
 
00:09:04.269 --> 00:09:04.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:06.680 align:start position:0%
Cobra I don't think Cobra is applicable
 
00:09:09.509 --> 00:09:09.519 align:start position:0%
to what you do is it because you're not
 
00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:12.360 align:start position:0%
Insurance we're not in insurance so
 
00:09:13.949 --> 00:09:13.959 align:start position:0%
we're we're cobbling together a response
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
to that um so because it's not an
 
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:18.640 align:start position:0%
insurance product it doesn't fall under
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
Cobra uh it is a obviously a benefit
 
00:09:23.430 --> 00:09:23.440 align:start position:0%
that is provided to State Employees but
 
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:26.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't fall under the category of
 
00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:31.040 align:start position:0%
insurance follow so if an employee left
 
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
today right a non-legislative employee
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
left today this Ben benefit would stop
 
00:09:39.470 --> 00:09:39.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
departure the short answer is yes one of
 
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:44.160 align:start position:0%
the issues that was discussed at the
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
policy committee level was to insert in
 
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.160 align:start position:0%
front of the word members of the general
 
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:50.720 align:start position:0%
court uh the word current so it' be very
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
clear that we were talking about current
 
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:54.480 align:start position:0%
members and not either past members or
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
ones who might have resigned or moved
 
00:09:58.470 --> 00:09:58.480 align:start position:0%
out of their particular district and had
 
00:10:00.750 --> 00:10:00.760 align:start position:0%
to resign design uh so the suggestion
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
was to add to word current to make that
 
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:04.600 align:start position:0%
very clear good good question R thank
 
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.069 align:start position:0%
very clear good good question R thank
you

00:10:07.069 --> 00:10:07.079 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
second so if if this is a benefit that
 
00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:12.959 align:start position:0%
is available to all
 
00:10:15.509 --> 00:10:15.519 align:start position:0%
400 some members are taking advantage
 
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:17.440 align:start position:0%
some members are
 
00:10:20.949 --> 00:10:20.959 align:start position:0%
not is that is that Equitable to all
 
00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:22.920 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
house and uh chairman Edwards
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
I like to respond to that go ahead so um
 
00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:33.160 align:start position:0%
in terms of the numbers it it's actually
 
00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
not just 400 uh for the representative
 
00:10:37.990 --> 00:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
also the other 24 other bodies so
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
include also state
 
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:42.720 align:start position:0%
senators and and also uh members of
 
00:10:46.389 --> 00:10:46.399 align:start position:0%
their their household um so the current
 
00:10:48.030 --> 00:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
model that we have working with the
 
00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:50.600 align:start position:0%
other state agencies is based upon an
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
understanding that the state agency
 
00:10:56.269 --> 00:10:56.279 align:start position:0%
themselves pay for a proportion of those
 
00:10:58.230 --> 00:10:58.240 align:start position:0%
costs for the services that Mr Lawless
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
and his employ employ assistance program
 
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:03.240 align:start position:0%
uh provide uh in terms of mechanics uh
 
00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:05.760 align:start position:0%
50% is paid for by the department to
 
00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:07.320 align:start position:0%
support his program which is budgeted
 
00:11:09.350 --> 00:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
through this Division and then the other
 
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:12.360 align:start position:0%
50% is uh from the other agencies
 
00:11:14.269 --> 00:11:14.279 align:start position:0%
transfers that we receive based upon
 
00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:16.200 align:start position:0%
those um memorandum of agreements that
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
have been entered into individually in
 
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:20.880 align:start position:0%
terms of the equity uh uh the the way
 
00:11:22.629 --> 00:11:22.639 align:start position:0%
that the EAP Works employee assistant
 
00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:24.720 align:start position:0%
program it's available to all employees
 
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
uh life circumstances randomly happen to
 
00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
folks whether it could be uh substance
 
00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:29.470 align:start position:0%
folks whether it could be uh substance
use

00:11:29.470 --> 00:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:11:31.829 --> 00:11:31.839 align:start position:0%
um matters if it's um uh issues
 
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:34.600 align:start position:0%
involving uh better management of money
 
00:11:37.069 --> 00:11:37.079 align:start position:0%
uh debtor creditor creditor um
 
00:11:40.069 --> 00:11:40.079 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health uh also um uh just all
 
00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:41.680 align:start position:0%
Healthcare uh including Behavioral
 
00:11:44.310 --> 00:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
Health uh that uh we would make sure
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
that they would be um served and the
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
fact that somebody wouldn't Avail
 
00:11:50.310 --> 00:11:50.320 align:start position:0%
themselves of that uh I I would not
 
00:11:52.190 --> 00:11:52.200 align:start position:0%
think that that would necessarily be a
 
00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:54.480 align:start position:0%
an equity um argument it would just be a
 
00:11:56.389 --> 00:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
personal choice or or not wanting to
 
00:11:59.430 --> 00:11:59.440 align:start position:0%
engage or not having to engage but most
 
00:12:02.069 --> 00:12:02.079 align:start position:0%
people do have life's struggles at some
 
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:04.720 align:start position:0%
point in time um Mr Al did you also have
 
00:12:06.269 --> 00:12:06.279 align:start position:0%
a response at all to
 
00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:08.920 align:start position:0%
that no other than just to add that the
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
the resources and the support I I
 
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:12.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate you bringing in the medical
 
00:12:13.910 --> 00:12:13.920 align:start position:0%
piece because the the challenges that
 
00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:16.160 align:start position:0%
can impact any individual state employee
 
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:18.240 align:start position:0%
family member I mean we we hear about it
 
00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:19.920 align:start position:0%
we see it every day anything that can
 
00:12:21.949 --> 00:12:21.959 align:start position:0%
impact one person is also available to
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
any one of us and so I think to that
 
00:12:25.629 --> 00:12:25.639 align:start position:0%
point just knowing that there are
 
00:12:28.710 --> 00:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
resources available um you know in terms
 
00:12:30.870 --> 00:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
of that return on investment there's
 
00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of evidence around the the
 
00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
benefit of eaps and when you bring it
 
00:12:37.829 --> 00:12:37.839 align:start position:0%
into the family the family realm I think
 
00:12:40.110 --> 00:12:40.120 align:start position:0%
that's just another added layer around
 
00:12:42.269 --> 00:12:42.279 align:start position:0%
what we all can carry when either we are
 
00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
struggling with something or somebody
 
00:12:48.470 --> 00:12:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's close to us is struggling L thank
 
00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:51.160 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:54.480 align:start position:0%
wer here for many years we've we've been
 
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:55.880 align:start position:0%
strong on the point that we are not
 
00:12:58.110 --> 00:12:58.120 align:start position:0%
employees in the legislature we are
 
00:13:01.670 --> 00:13:01.680 align:start position:0%
elected by people we are not appointed
 
00:13:03.829 --> 00:13:03.839 align:start position:0%
by anybody within government we can't be
 
00:13:05.629 --> 00:13:05.639 align:start position:0%
fired by anyone within government we're
 
00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:10.199 align:start position:0%
fired by the people who elected us so to
 
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:12.360 align:start position:0%
try to get into employee benefits I'm
 
00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.120 align:start position:0%
opposed and I think that's why it
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
probably was defeated in the committee
 
00:13:19.069 --> 00:13:19.079 align:start position:0%
um as you say we've been able to get
 
00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560 align:start position:0%
into some programs where we pay for them
 
00:13:23.110 --> 00:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
and some people have got into the health
 
00:13:25.310 --> 00:13:25.320 align:start position:0%
insurance but
 
00:13:28.389 --> 00:13:28.399 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a privilege that's been
 
00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.629 align:start position:0%
that's kind of a privilege that's been
added

00:13:29.629 --> 00:13:29.639 align:start position:0%
added
 
00:13:33.069 --> 00:13:33.079 align:start position:0%
and you pay for it yourself so this I
 
00:13:34.829 --> 00:13:34.839 align:start position:0%
see the model should be repeated the
 
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:37.040 align:start position:0%
same way here rather than having
 
00:13:39.069 --> 00:13:39.079 align:start position:0%
everybody paid for whether they want it
 
00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:42.320 align:start position:0%
or not we're not employees I want it see
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
so we shouldn't be an employee
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
assistance programs thank you so you
 
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:48.040 align:start position:0%
don't have to answer that that's a
 
00:13:50.150 --> 00:13:50.160 align:start position:0%
legislative policy issue that's outside
 
00:13:52.350 --> 00:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
the Department's purview but rep uh
 
00:13:55.069 --> 00:13:55.079 align:start position:0%
representative H thank you this question
 
00:13:56.910 --> 00:13:56.920 align:start position:0%

typ should should should I introduce my
 
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:04.720 align:start position:0%

00:14:18.069 --> 00:14:18.079 align:start position:0%
uh the effective date is not a typo it's
 
00:14:19.870 --> 00:14:19.880 align:start position:0%
July 1
 
00:14:23.430 --> 00:14:23.440 align:start position:0%
2034 two so that's basically 10 years
 
00:14:26.269 --> 00:14:26.279 align:start position:0%
what what's the rationale the rationale
 
00:14:28.949 --> 00:14:28.959 align:start position:0%
builds off of what representative wer
 
00:14:32.230 --> 00:14:32.240 align:start position:0%
said is that this is a new benef this
 
00:14:34.790 --> 00:14:34.800 align:start position:0%
is there are no questions for you in
 
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:40.120 align:start position:0%
here um so um it it it it it it builds
 
00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:43.759 align:start position:0%
off the idea that as legislators we're
 
00:14:46.990 --> 00:14:47.000 align:start position:0%
not signing up for a compensation and
 
00:14:49.910 --> 00:14:49.920 align:start position:0%
benefits plan like an employee and this
 
00:14:53.430 --> 00:14:53.440 align:start position:0%
is a new benefit and because it's a new
 
00:14:57.710 --> 00:14:57.720 align:start position:0%
benefit uh I would want to um separate
 
00:14:59.590 --> 00:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
from the current
 
00:15:02.590 --> 00:15:02.600 align:start position:0%
vote though that population that would
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
actually benefit from the benefit that
 
00:15:08.670 --> 00:15:08.680 align:start position:0%
we would be creating with this bill and
 
00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
so I I I just arbitrarily said 10 years
 
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
because I don't know how many of us
 
00:15:17.870 --> 00:15:17.880 align:start position:0%
think that we're going to stick around
 
00:15:20.030 --> 00:15:20.040 align:start position:0%
for 10 years so that we can get access
 
00:15:22.350 --> 00:15:22.360 align:start position:0%
to the employee assistance program we'd
 
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:25.440 align:start position:0%
have to be a little uh uh I'm not going
 
00:15:28.749 --> 00:15:28.759 align:start position:0%
to say the word nuts maybe but uh go
 
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you for your explanation I
 
00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:32.399 align:start position:0%
was going to ask whether that could have
 
00:15:34.829 --> 00:15:34.839 align:start position:0%
been July 1st
 
00:15:37.030 --> 00:15:37.040 align:start position:0%
2025 which is the beginning of a new
 
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:38.230 align:start position:0%
2025 which is the beginning of a new
bium

00:15:38.230 --> 00:15:38.240 align:start position:0%
bium
 
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
financially I thought it was a typo
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
that's how I took it but at a minimum it
 
00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
should be the beginning of the next
 
00:15:47.230 --> 00:15:47.240 align:start position:0%
budget cycle so that no one that I
 
00:15:48.829 --> 00:15:48.839 align:start position:0%
understand your logic and I I completely
 
00:15:51.350 --> 00:15:51.360 align:start position:0%
support your logic no one who is a
 
00:15:53.629 --> 00:15:53.639 align:start position:0%
direct beneficiary of of the program
 
00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:55.160 align:start position:0%
would be voting on the program and
 
00:15:57.269 --> 00:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
there's a there's a congressional level
 
00:15:59.110 --> 00:15:59.120 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment type thing as
 
00:16:00.949 --> 00:16:00.959 align:start position:0%
well that talks to this that we should
 
00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:02.680 align:start position:0%
not be voting on things that affect
 
00:16:06.189 --> 00:16:06.199 align:start position:0%
directly affect us so at a minimum even
 
00:16:07.590 --> 00:16:07.600 align:start position:0%
if there's a separate amendment I would
 
00:16:09.110 --> 00:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
request that it not be any sooner than
 
00:16:10.309 --> 00:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
July 1st
 
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:14.120 align:start position:0%
2025 so if we go down that road I I'm
 
00:16:16.749 --> 00:16:16.759 align:start position:0%
I'm totally open to discussing what the
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
end date is I just want to make sure
 
00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:20.920 align:start position:0%
that there's a clear boundary between
 
00:16:23.470 --> 00:16:23.480 align:start position:0%
the people who are voting to self Eng
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
grandis their benefits package from the
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
ones that actually receive it and I I
 
00:16:31.350 --> 00:16:31.360 align:start position:0%
wanted separated you say by budget year
 
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
I I rather than say budget cycle I would
 
00:16:37.430 --> 00:16:37.440 align:start position:0%
say election cycle because the you know
 
00:16:39.389 --> 00:16:39.399 align:start position:0%
the voters should determine whether or
 
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:41.480 align:start position:0%
not we should be getting this additional
 
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
benefit not ourselves we're in agreement
 
00:16:48.430 --> 00:16:48.440 align:start position:0%
okay U representative tki thank you I
 
00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
would just like to say that um I can
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
support the logic for
 
00:16:57.629 --> 00:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
2025 since all of us don't know if we're
 
00:16:59.389 --> 00:16:59.399 align:start position:0%
going to be here next year
 
00:17:01.990 --> 00:17:02.000 align:start position:0%
um and I think that you know we don't
 
00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:05.199 align:start position:0%
know who those 424 people are but I
 
00:17:09.110 --> 00:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
believe that the program itself is
 
00:17:11.909 --> 00:17:11.919 align:start position:0%
invaluable to those who find themselves
 
00:17:15.750 --> 00:17:15.760 align:start position:0%
in a situation of having to um need that
 
00:17:18.390 --> 00:17:18.400 align:start position:0%
and I think it could help in terms of
 
00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
retention of quality legislators
 
00:17:26.750 --> 00:17:26.760 align:start position:0%
allowing them to um maybe get you know a
 
00:17:29.549 --> 00:17:29.559 align:start position:0%
referral somewhere um um just a
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
listening ear to help them show up and
 
00:17:35.630 --> 00:17:35.640 align:start position:0%
do their work um support themselves in a
 
00:17:38.750 --> 00:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
way that allows them to serve allows
 
00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240 align:start position:0%
them to show up and I at first also with
 
00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:46.080 align:start position:0%
my colleague over there thought it was a
 
00:17:48.750 --> 00:17:48.760 align:start position:0%
typo but I think that by adjusting it to
 
00:17:50.950 --> 00:17:50.960 align:start position:0%
2025 we may be in a position that we
 
00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:54.360 align:start position:0%
could satisfy um
 
00:17:57.390 --> 00:17:57.400 align:start position:0%
everyone's needs to push it
 
00:18:03.789 --> 00:18:03.799 align:start position:0%
out all right um yes so so I the other
 
00:18:05.950 --> 00:18:05.960 align:start position:0%
concerns I had about this I he I he
 
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:07.360 align:start position:0%
heard everything you said everything he
 
00:18:09.669 --> 00:18:09.679 align:start position:0%
said is reasonable the free market is
 
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840 align:start position:0%
validated eaps as being uh a worthwhile
 
00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:16.600 align:start position:0%
employee investment so so I don't I
 
00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:19.320 align:start position:0%
don't have an argument on on on that
 
00:18:22.990 --> 00:18:23.000 align:start position:0%
level my my my argument against this
 
00:18:26.990 --> 00:18:27.000 align:start position:0%
bill is that uh it's a new benefit for
 
00:18:29.870 --> 00:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
legislators and as representative wer
 
00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:31.840 align:start position:0%
pointed out and as I've come to
 
00:18:36.029 --> 00:18:36.039 align:start position:0%
understand it is is that uh we we have
 
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:40.600 align:start position:0%
assiduously held to the idea that uh the
 
00:18:44.390 --> 00:18:44.400 align:start position:0%
compensation we get per the Constitution
 
00:18:46.350 --> 00:18:46.360 align:start position:0%
is pretty much everything we get I mean
 
00:18:47.950 --> 00:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
we get mileage that's not in the
 
00:18:51.149 --> 00:18:51.159 align:start position:0%
Constitution I don't think but um but
 
00:18:53.190 --> 00:18:53.200 align:start position:0%
adding benefits for
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
legislators is just a really bad
 
00:18:59.630 --> 00:18:59.640 align:start position:0%
precedent I don't want to break glass on
 
00:19:02.669 --> 00:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
that I don't I don't want to do that and
 
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:05.880 align:start position:0%
then the fact that this is the first
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
cost free benefit that would go to
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
legislators we can sign up for the
 
00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:12.200 align:start position:0%
dental program we can sign up for the
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
medical program but this would be at no
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
cost to a legislator and I I that's
 
00:19:20.190 --> 00:19:20.200 align:start position:0%
another precedent that I would want to
 
00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:23.080 align:start position:0%
avoid um the fact that this program
 
00:19:25.390 --> 00:19:25.400 align:start position:0%
doesn't have an opt out procedure built
 
00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:28.520 align:start position:0%
into it uh and that it's including
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
family members and so there's a kind of
 
00:19:33.669 --> 00:19:33.679 align:start position:0%
a redundancy here because some people
 
00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:35.240 align:start position:0%
have full-time benefits I think
 
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:37.600 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham alluded to that
 
00:19:40.070 --> 00:19:40.080 align:start position:0%
you know so there's kind of a double
 
00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:43.480 align:start position:0%
dipping or double benefit component to
 
00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
this so so those are reasons that I have
 
00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:48.520 align:start position:0%
a problem with this bill I just wanted
 
00:19:50.270 --> 00:19:50.280 align:start position:0%
to get that out there and go ahead go
 
00:19:52.470 --> 00:19:52.480 align:start position:0%
ahead well I'll say first off I don't
 
00:19:55.750 --> 00:19:55.760 align:start position:0%
have a benefit since um I am not don't
 
00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
have a full-time employer but I'm just
 
00:19:59.549 --> 00:19:59.559 align:start position:0%
curious when you were talking about we
 
00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:02.080 align:start position:0%
don't have a a benefit like that the
 
00:20:03.350 --> 00:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
first thing that popped into my head was
 
00:20:06.350 --> 00:20:06.360 align:start position:0%
the the um complex nurse the State House
 
00:20:08.909 --> 00:20:08.919 align:start position:0%
nurse you know we we have that
 
00:20:10.710 --> 00:20:10.720 align:start position:0%
opportunity to go and meet with the
 
00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:15.080 align:start position:0%
nurse if we're having um I would say I'd
 
00:20:17.270 --> 00:20:17.280 align:start position:0%
be welcome in there for a physical issue
 
00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:19.919 align:start position:0%
but also um you know a mental health
 
00:20:21.830 --> 00:20:21.840 align:start position:0%
issue I need um a little guidance on
 
00:20:23.470 --> 00:20:23.480 align:start position:0%
something so I guess I would argue that
 
00:20:27.029 --> 00:20:27.039 align:start position:0%
we do have a benefit like that related
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
to our well-being all right
 
00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
I I think that's an excellent possible
 
00:20:33.470 --> 00:20:33.480 align:start position:0%
example I I'd want to drill into it just
 
00:20:36.350 --> 00:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
a little bit more uh it it was my
 
00:20:38.909 --> 00:20:38.919 align:start position:0%
understanding that the the nurse on site
 
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:42.000 align:start position:0%
is really here for emergency care in
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
case somebody the day of session or the
 
00:20:46.950 --> 00:20:46.960 align:start position:0%
day of committee needed some kind of
 
00:20:49.909 --> 00:20:49.919 align:start position:0%
medical assistance I I I did not I have
 
00:20:53.190 --> 00:20:53.200 align:start position:0%
not in four terms perceived the nurse as
 
00:20:55.110 --> 00:20:55.120 align:start position:0%
somebody I could go to almost on a
 
00:20:57.470 --> 00:20:57.480 align:start position:0%
clinical appointment basis to get you
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
know supplemental help other than
 
00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:02.480 align:start position:0%
emergent care so that that's just a fact
 
00:21:04.909 --> 00:21:04.919 align:start position:0%
thing that I I don't know do you do you
 
00:21:07.230 --> 00:21:07.240 align:start position:0%
know my first term I had two different
 
00:21:10.390 --> 00:21:10.400 align:start position:0%
surgeries and so I connected with her
 
00:21:12.669 --> 00:21:12.679 align:start position:0%
often on my well-being and my ability to
 
00:21:15.909 --> 00:21:15.919 align:start position:0%
serve and um getting a a better parking
 
00:21:18.470 --> 00:21:18.480 align:start position:0%
spot getting some um over-the-counter
 
00:21:20.149 --> 00:21:20.159 align:start position:0%
medications when I needed it when I was
 
00:21:21.909 --> 00:21:21.919 align:start position:0%
in committee different things like that
 
00:21:25.390 --> 00:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
and I I just you know I see that as a
 
00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
benefit of working in the building and I
 
00:21:28.510 --> 00:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
guess I'm just using that it's an
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
that did you have a question so you
 
00:21:37.669 --> 00:21:37.679 align:start position:0%
haven't asked one yet so go ahead thank
 
00:21:40.190 --> 00:21:40.200 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um my question is I I
 
00:21:42.029 --> 00:21:42.039 align:start position:0%
had worked um when I was on that cuss
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
between being a contractor and an
 
00:21:47.110 --> 00:21:47.120 align:start position:0%
employee and that line was very um
 
00:21:48.990 --> 00:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
Nimble on the federal government's uh
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
definitions about when they decided that
 
00:21:53.070 --> 00:21:53.080 align:start position:0%
you wanted to be considered an employee
 
00:21:55.430 --> 00:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
even though you were you were were not
 
00:21:57.470 --> 00:21:57.480 align:start position:0%
really acting as an employee I'm
 
00:21:58.990 --> 00:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about what the cost would be
 
00:22:01.590 --> 00:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
to the state if doing this would move us
 
00:22:04.029 --> 00:22:04.039 align:start position:0%
towards a path of being deemed employees
 
00:22:05.470 --> 00:22:05.480 align:start position:0%
and therefore subject to things like
 
00:22:09.029 --> 00:22:09.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:11.630 --> 00:22:11.640 align:start position:0%
benefits C could you elaborate on that
 
00:22:15.029 --> 00:22:15.039 align:start position:0%
are you are you concerned that the um
 
00:22:17.870 --> 00:22:17.880 align:start position:0%
the the the presence of one employee
 
00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:20.720 align:start position:0%
like benefit could in trigger an
 
00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:23.919 align:start position:0%
interpretation by a future court that we
 
00:22:26.430 --> 00:22:26.440 align:start position:0%
are in fact employees and therefore
 
00:22:30.029 --> 00:22:30.039 align:start position:0%
become uh un intentionally subject to
 
00:22:32.669 --> 00:22:32.679 align:start position:0%
the minimum wage law um yes especially
 
00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:35.760 align:start position:0%
if other benefits also
 
00:22:39.029 --> 00:22:39.039 align:start position:0%
follow representative Stringham I I just
 
00:22:40.510 --> 00:22:40.520 align:start position:0%
want to comment again from my own
 
00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
experience a little bit differently that
 
00:22:43.990 --> 00:22:44.000 align:start position:0%
you know we offer health insurance
 
00:22:45.470 --> 00:22:45.480 align:start position:0%
employees all pay a portion of their
 
00:22:47.710 --> 00:22:47.720 align:start position:0%
health insurance we offer retirement
 
00:22:49.549 --> 00:22:49.559 align:start position:0%
employees contribute to their retirement
 
00:22:52.430 --> 00:22:52.440 align:start position:0%
programs we offer Dental employees pay
 
00:22:54.310 --> 00:22:54.320 align:start position:0%
portion of the dental we have an EAP
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
program employe employees don't pay
 
00:23:00.549 --> 00:23:00.559 align:start position:0%
anything for that um um uh you know I I
 
00:23:03.230 --> 00:23:03.240 align:start position:0%
I get your point of slippery slope I do
 
00:23:06.190 --> 00:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
think an assistant program is about
 
00:23:09.269 --> 00:23:09.279 align:start position:0%
having you know a body of people getting
 
00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:13.559 align:start position:0%
work done that uh when they when they uh
 
00:23:16.470 --> 00:23:16.480 align:start position:0%
need some kind of Psychosocial place
 
00:23:18.510 --> 00:23:18.520 align:start position:0%
they have at least a place to start the
 
00:23:21.430 --> 00:23:21.440 align:start position:0%
Ben the EAP program runs out pretty
 
00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
quickly uh if somebody has you know a
 
00:23:27.149 --> 00:23:27.159 align:start position:0%
major mental type of issue then it has
 
00:23:29.750 --> 00:23:29.760 align:start position:0%
to go back into more traditional health
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
insurance or out of pocket payment so I
 
00:23:35.470 --> 00:23:35.480 align:start position:0%
I don't uh you know while I appreciate
 
00:23:40.149 --> 00:23:40.159 align:start position:0%
the uh um the enlightenment about uh
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
this kind of being an employee like
 
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
benefit I don't view it as an employee
 
00:23:48.149 --> 00:23:48.159 align:start position:0%
benefit I view it this is something that
 
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520 align:start position:0%
um um that you know the body that's
 
00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
trying to get work done is doing so that
 
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:57.320 align:start position:0%
they have uh as capable a group ready to
 
00:23:59.350 --> 00:23:59.360 align:start position:0%
move forward as possible especially
 
00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:01.760 align:start position:0%
under these types of circumstances thank
 
00:24:04.230 --> 00:24:04.240 align:start position:0%
you may I ask you a
 
00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:07.440 align:start position:0%
question in an employee handbook in the
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
fields that you've been in where an
 
00:24:13.029 --> 00:24:13.039 align:start position:0%
employee assistance program is offered
 
00:24:16.549 --> 00:24:16.559 align:start position:0%
when the employee receives uh uh
 
00:24:18.549 --> 00:24:18.559 align:start position:0%
something from HR saying here's your
 
00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
compensation and and benefit package are
 
00:24:25.470 --> 00:24:25.480 align:start position:0%
eaps listed as a benefit in the as part
 
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:28.640 align:start position:0%
of an overall benefit package
 
00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:31.000 align:start position:0%
in my experience they have but I don't
 
00:24:33.110 --> 00:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
i' I've only been in three different
 
00:24:36.149 --> 00:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
corporations that had
 
00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
eaps uh I appreciate the question I
 
00:24:40.230 --> 00:24:40.240 align:start position:0%
don't remember if it's in the employee
 
00:24:46.230 --> 00:24:46.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:50.149 --> 00:24:50.159 align:start position:0%
so Mr Williams so none of that was for
 
00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:53.960 align:start position:0%
you but I'm just curious um as an
 
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:57.200 align:start position:0%
attorney um or do do you do you do you
 
00:25:01.990 --> 00:25:02.000 align:start position:0%
feel like you're um in in the right area
 
00:25:05.470 --> 00:25:05.480 align:start position:0%
to comment on representative Leon's
 
00:25:08.710 --> 00:25:08.720 align:start position:0%
observation on the on employees that's a
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
special that's a special section of law
 
00:25:13.630 --> 00:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
that you may not be familiar with to the
 
00:25:15.669 --> 00:25:15.679 align:start position:0%
extent you're comfortable saying
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
something uh chairman Edwards thank you
 
00:25:19.710 --> 00:25:19.720 align:start position:0%
I am here today in my capacity as the
 
00:25:21.909 --> 00:25:21.919 align:start position:0%
legislative director I am active member
 
00:25:24.389 --> 00:25:24.399 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire bar my commentary is
 
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:26.480 align:start position:0%
the same observation that was raised by
 
00:25:28.669 --> 00:25:28.679 align:start position:0%
represent Lon was also raised at the
 
00:25:30.310 --> 00:25:30.320 align:start position:0%
policy committee before a legislative
 
00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:32.720 align:start position:0%
Administration one of the uh potential
 
00:25:34.590 --> 00:25:34.600 align:start position:0%
remedies to that is to put language like
 
00:25:36.789 --> 00:25:36.799 align:start position:0%
this into the bill which would be
 
00:25:38.070 --> 00:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
nothing in the section shall be
 
00:25:39.510 --> 00:25:39.520 align:start position:0%
construed that members of the general
 
00:25:41.190 --> 00:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
court or employees are otherwise deemed
 
00:25:42.669 --> 00:25:42.679 align:start position:0%
anything but members of the legislative
 
00:25:44.669 --> 00:25:44.679 align:start position:0%
branch that was one of the Alternatives
 
00:25:46.269 --> 00:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
that was somewhat discussed before that
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
committee and I know that that's not
 
00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
getting to the complete substance but
 
00:25:52.310 --> 00:25:52.320 align:start position:0%
certainly if you need additional
 
00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:53.960 align:start position:0%
information you have the wonderful
 
00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
attorney Jim Santi who could be
 
00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:57.399 align:start position:0%
available to you to address any other
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
further questions where where he does
 
00:26:01.669 --> 00:26:01.679 align:start position:0%
represent the legislature do do either
 
00:26:04.110 --> 00:26:04.120 align:start position:0%
of you have anything else to add u based
 
00:26:07.029 --> 00:26:07.039 align:start position:0%
on the observing our conversation and
 
00:26:08.990 --> 00:26:09.000 align:start position:0%
and do any legislators have any
 
00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:11.480 align:start position:0%
questions to ask further representative
 
00:26:14.590 --> 00:26:14.600 align:start position:0%
Mooney uh think about what you may want
 
00:26:15.669 --> 00:26:15.679 align:start position:0%
to still
 
00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:19.320 align:start position:0%
say thank you how many currently
 
00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:22.960 align:start position:0%
full-time state employees have
 
00:26:26.190 --> 00:26:26.200 align:start position:0%
access to the employee assistance
 
00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:28.760 align:start position:0%
program yeah so the the the estimates
 
00:26:32.070 --> 00:26:32.080 align:start position:0%
are over 10,000 of uh full-time state
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
employees when when this is initially
 
00:26:36.269 --> 00:26:36.279 align:start position:0%
budgeted it's anticipated how many
 
00:26:38.269 --> 00:26:38.279 align:start position:0%
positions may be filled and then you
 
00:26:40.269 --> 00:26:40.279 align:start position:0%
know there's always kind of uh
 
00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:42.000 align:start position:0%
transition every states with with
 
00:26:45.430 --> 00:26:45.440 align:start position:0%
positions but it's over 10,000 at this
 
00:26:47.389 --> 00:26:47.399 align:start position:0%
point and
 
00:26:50.549 --> 00:26:50.559 align:start position:0%
part-time I don't have that number uh
 
00:26:52.149 --> 00:26:52.159 align:start position:0%
and that may be represented in that
 
00:26:54.389 --> 00:26:54.399 align:start position:0%
total number I apologize I I don't have
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
it uh separated that way thank you
 
00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:01.640 align:start position:0%
fulltime I'm guessing is 35
 
00:27:05.190 --> 00:27:05.200 align:start position:0%
hours most employees 37 37 and a half I
 
00:27:06.909 --> 00:27:06.919 align:start position:0%
should say most but there are 40 hour
 
00:27:09.070 --> 00:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
employees depending on uh some of the
 
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:11.240 align:start position:0%
institutions part time is approximately
 
00:27:12.669 --> 00:27:12.679 align:start position:0%
20 or
 
00:27:16.990 --> 00:27:17.000 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm I'm not sure whatever okay I
 
00:27:20.230 --> 00:27:20.240 align:start position:0%
guess my my question then becomes if
 
00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:23.520 align:start position:0%
this bill were to pass legislators would
 
00:27:27.070 --> 00:27:27.080 align:start position:0%
be for lack of a better phrase the least
 
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:28.230 align:start position:0%
be for lack of a better phrase the least
working

00:27:28.230 --> 00:27:28.240 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
class of individuals to access this
 
00:27:34.510 --> 00:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
program considering some don't have
 
00:27:36.830 --> 00:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
committee assignments off for the summer
 
00:27:39.549 --> 00:27:39.559 align:start position:0%
campaigning in the fall and so on so
 
00:27:42.950 --> 00:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:44.950 --> 00:27:44.960 align:start position:0%
statement what what I would say to that
 
00:27:46.669 --> 00:27:46.679 align:start position:0%
is I know we provide services to
 
00:27:48.630 --> 00:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
seasonal employees and and there's many
 
00:27:50.430 --> 00:27:50.440 align:start position:0%
departments that contract us that have a
 
00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:52.600 align:start position:0%
different kind of range of what hours
 
00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:54.200 align:start position:0%
their employees may work so I wouldn't
 
00:27:57.830 --> 00:27:57.840 align:start position:0%
be able to say more than that so so I
 
00:27:59.350 --> 00:27:59.360 align:start position:0%
think you're bringing up an excellent
 
00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:02.880 align:start position:0%
point we we are the the smallest part of
 
00:28:05.389 --> 00:28:05.399 align:start position:0%
the part-time employee Force technically
 
00:28:09.149 --> 00:28:09.159 align:start position:0%
and and so could you give us get to us a
 
00:28:13.549 --> 00:28:13.559 align:start position:0%
copy of of the policy that says you know
 
00:28:15.669 --> 00:28:15.679 align:start position:0%
part-time this is whether or not you're
 
00:28:17.389 --> 00:28:17.399 align:start position:0%
eligible whether it's seasonal or
 
00:28:20.230 --> 00:28:20.240 align:start position:0%
whatever I I I I just want to be able to
 
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
Benchmark what the legislature is
 
00:28:25.830 --> 00:28:25.840 align:start position:0%
relative to the part-time employees that
 
00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:27.720 align:start position:0%
receive this benefit we don't
 
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:29.200 align:start position:0%
distinguish between part-time and
 
00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:30.720 align:start position:0%
full-time in terms of our service
 
00:28:32.789 --> 00:28:32.799 align:start position:0%
delivery model if you are no no no no
 
00:28:35.789 --> 00:28:35.799 align:start position:0%
not Service delivery but
 
00:28:38.430 --> 00:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility anybody would be
 
00:28:42.630 --> 00:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
eligible if if an employee is working
 
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:45.360 align:start position:0%
five hours a week I don't know that we
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
have any of those but they would be
 
00:28:49.909 --> 00:28:49.919 align:start position:0%
eligible for the EAP program if they
 
00:28:51.830 --> 00:28:51.840 align:start position:0%
were if they had paid based on that cost
 
00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600 align:start position:0%
allocation formula then they would be
 
00:28:56.389 --> 00:28:56.399 align:start position:0%
eligible for the same
 
00:28:56.399 --> 00:28:59.590 align:start position:0%
eligible for the same
services

00:28:59.590 --> 00:28:59.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:03.240 align:start position:0%
r r uh Mr
 
00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
White good good afternoon members of the
 
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh Nathan white Chief
 
00:29:08.070 --> 00:29:08.080 align:start position:0%
Financial Officer with health and human
 
00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:10.000 align:start position:0%
services so I just kind of want to level
 
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:12.120 align:start position:0%
set just to help address this question
 
00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:14.640 align:start position:0%
so this coming August and every other
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
August during the agency budget phase we
 
00:29:20.470 --> 00:29:20.480 align:start position:0%
work with EAP to develop their budget so
 
00:29:23.870 --> 00:29:23.880 align:start position:0%
for the current fisal year $928,000
 
00:29:27.509 --> 00:29:27.519 align:start position:0%
we also during that point in time we
 
00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:28.880 align:start position:0%
work with the Department administrative
 
00:29:31.590 --> 00:29:31.600 align:start position:0%
services to identify what are all of the
 
00:29:34.669 --> 00:29:34.679 align:start position:0%
funded classified and unclassified
 
00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:37.279 align:start position:0%
positions that currently exist um for
 
00:29:39.310 --> 00:29:39.320 align:start position:0%
the current budget it was almost
 
00:29:42.669 --> 00:29:42.679 align:start position:0%
11,000 um we take that we apply a ratio
 
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:44.120 align:start position:0%
and then we divy it up and so when you
 
00:29:45.389 --> 00:29:45.399 align:start position:0%
look at our budget when we work with
 
00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:47.840 align:start position:0%
division three a percentage of that
 
00:29:50.110 --> 00:29:50.120 align:start position:0%
roughly half is other funds the money
 
00:29:52.389 --> 00:29:52.399 align:start position:0%
coming from the other state agencies and
 
00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:54.600 align:start position:0%
then the remaining amount is federal and
 
00:29:58.830 --> 00:29:58.840 align:start position:0%
general funds for hhs's budget um so so
 
00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:02.200 align:start position:0%
we do not budget down to the part-time
 
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:04.600 align:start position:0%
employee level when we're making these
 
00:30:07.990 --> 00:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
decisions so if this bill were to pass
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
the 424 additional members would
 
00:30:12.710 --> 00:30:12.720 align:start position:0%
basically be factored into that roughly
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
11,000 which would represent I don't
 
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:16.960 align:start position:0%
know like 4% something like that off the
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
back just back of the envelope math um
 
00:30:22.110 --> 00:30:22.120 align:start position:0%
so so that would be that 17 that roughly
 
00:30:24.870 --> 00:30:24.880 align:start position:0%
$177,000 annual impact where we would
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
assume we would receive s roughly
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
$177,000 from the legislature to pay for
 
00:30:33.029 --> 00:30:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.269 --> 00:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
Services okay so that was good that's
 
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:38.080 align:start position:0%
all money right it isn't specifically
 
00:30:41.430 --> 00:30:41.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility but but I I I I think it's
 
00:30:43.710 --> 00:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
safe to assume that part of the
 
00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
eligibility answer is they have to be
 
00:30:50.909 --> 00:30:50.919 align:start position:0%
hired and they can't be uh no longer an
 
00:30:52.909 --> 00:30:52.919 align:start position:0%
employee they have to be actively
 
00:30:55.230 --> 00:30:55.240 align:start position:0%
employed and as long as they were
 
00:30:58.029 --> 00:30:58.039 align:start position:0%
employed enough to show up in one of
 
00:30:58.039 --> 00:30:58.830 align:start position:0%
employed enough to show up in one of
those

00:30:58.830 --> 00:30:58.840 align:start position:0%
those
 
00:31:01.549 --> 00:31:01.559 align:start position:0%
classification levels then there was
 
00:31:05.029 --> 00:31:05.039 align:start position:0%
probably a cost allocation done and the
 
00:31:08.029 --> 00:31:08.039 align:start position:0%
money has been taken care of and and the
 
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
implication is that they have
 
00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:11.919 align:start position:0%
eligibility yes and and the budget is
 
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:14.120 align:start position:0%
based on total funded positions not
 
00:31:17.990 --> 00:31:18.000 align:start position:0%
total filled positions funded okay okay
 
00:31:20.110 --> 00:31:20.120 align:start position:0%
uh representative Leon U thank you Mr
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
chairman um it when seasonal employees
 
00:31:24.549 --> 00:31:24.559 align:start position:0%
were mentioned I was curious as to
 
00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:26.360 align:start position:0%
whether seasonal employees if they come
 
00:31:28.190 --> 00:31:28.200 align:start position:0%
back every season are provided this
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
benefit when they're not working just as
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
legislators who are in the off seon and
 
00:31:33.909 --> 00:31:33.919 align:start position:0%
not coming in do you know if those
 
00:31:35.669 --> 00:31:35.679 align:start position:0%
seasonal employees that are hired every
 
00:31:37.389 --> 00:31:37.399 align:start position:0%
year um receive this benefit when
 
00:31:38.909 --> 00:31:38.919 align:start position:0%
they're not actually working for the
 
00:31:41.149 --> 00:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
state and putting in any hours I don't
 
00:31:42.909 --> 00:31:42.919 align:start position:0%
have that information in front of me I I
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
think that and a taking that question as
 
00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200 align:start position:0%
a case-by Case Model if somebody reached
 
00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:48.880 align:start position:0%
out and said that they were an employee
 
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:50.600 align:start position:0%
a seasonal employee we wouldn't be
 
00:31:53.190 --> 00:31:53.200 align:start position:0%
saying but are you currently working uh
 
00:31:54.950 --> 00:31:54.960 align:start position:0%
we would still provide the same Services
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
if they reached
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:57.950 align:start position:0%
if they reached
out

00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:32:01.149 --> 00:32:01.159 align:start position:0%
thank you represent
 
00:32:03.870 --> 00:32:03.880 align:start position:0%
hle we covered the number of employees
 
00:32:05.950 --> 00:32:05.960 align:start position:0%
that are eligible do you have any data
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
relative to the usage of this service
 
00:32:13.389 --> 00:32:13.399 align:start position:0%
number of phone calls right by month
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
by however you'd have the
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
data so again I'll reference our data
 
00:32:20.669 --> 00:32:20.679 align:start position:0%
management system because you know in
 
00:32:22.710 --> 00:32:22.720 align:start position:0%
the in the close to 40 years that the
 
00:32:26.029 --> 00:32:26.039 align:start position:0%
program has been in place a lot of our
 
00:32:28.269 --> 00:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
data has been uh kind of paper and
 
00:32:30.430 --> 00:32:30.440 align:start position:0%
pencil Excel and trying to really
 
00:32:33.149 --> 00:32:33.159 align:start position:0%
identify what a what an what a client
 
00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
contact constitutes is uh it covers a
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
lot of ground in certain ways and so
 
00:32:41.470 --> 00:32:41.480 align:start position:0%
what I will say is looking at our most
 
00:32:45.629 --> 00:32:45.639 align:start position:0%
most um research suggests that eaps
 
00:32:49.110 --> 00:32:49.120 align:start position:0%
operate at about a 6% uh utilization we
 
00:32:51.789 --> 00:32:51.799 align:start position:0%
are we exceed at least 10% and the
 
00:32:53.629 --> 00:32:53.639 align:start position:0%
reason why I'm a bit vague with that is
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
because when we look at actual numbers
 
00:32:58.710 --> 00:32:58.720 align:start position:0%
of clients served in terms of uh direct
 
00:33:00.669 --> 00:33:00.679 align:start position:0%
meetings face Toof face or telephonic
 
00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:03.279 align:start position:0%
opening a case and providing specific
 
00:33:06.430 --> 00:33:06.440 align:start position:0%
resources um the the most recent
 
00:33:08.990 --> 00:33:09.000 align:start position:0%
information I've seen is over 700
 
00:33:10.669 --> 00:33:10.679 align:start position:0%
looking at the calendar year which is
 
00:33:13.389 --> 00:33:13.399 align:start position:0%
actually an uptick related to uh impart
 
00:33:16.110 --> 00:33:16.120 align:start position:0%
the events at New Hampshire hospital but
 
00:33:18.029 --> 00:33:18.039 align:start position:0%
when we when we really kind of open that
 
00:33:20.029 --> 00:33:20.039 align:start position:0%
up even further in terms of the data
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
management system providing us real
 
00:33:25.590 --> 00:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
updates around Service delivery and
 
00:33:27.710 --> 00:33:27.720 align:start position:0%
Trends one of the things that that
 
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:29.720 align:start position:0%
number doesn't take into account is the
 
00:33:31.110 --> 00:33:31.120 align:start position:0%
is the fact that we do a number of
 
00:33:33.190 --> 00:33:33.200 align:start position:0%
different groups we do orientations we
 
00:33:36.149 --> 00:33:36.159 align:start position:0%
do trainings we do conflict resolutions
 
00:33:39.750 --> 00:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
within agencies and so to uh to look at
 
00:33:41.389 --> 00:33:41.399 align:start position:0%
what is counted as a case what is
 
00:33:43.389 --> 00:33:43.399 align:start position:0%
counted as a client contact those
 
00:33:45.350 --> 00:33:45.360 align:start position:0%
numbers exceed even the numbers that
 
00:33:47.190 --> 00:33:47.200 align:start position:0%
I've uh greatly exceed those numbers
 
00:33:49.669 --> 00:33:49.679 align:start position:0%
that I referenced is it possible for you
 
00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
to get us that data just at some level
 
00:33:54.669 --> 00:33:54.679 align:start position:0%
in some format
 
00:33:57.269 --> 00:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
yes are are there other questions from
 
00:34:00.789 --> 00:34:00.799 align:start position:0%
the legislators I I that that triggered
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
an interesting thought if you step into
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
help with conflict resolution we could
 
00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
busy well I thought of that earlier but
 
00:34:13.829 --> 00:34:13.839 align:start position:0%
I didn't want to assume too much there
 
00:34:15.990 --> 00:34:16.000 align:start position:0%
but we we certainly are available in way
 
00:34:17.349 --> 00:34:17.359 align:start position:0%
all right so so what I'm what I'm going
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
to do with this is um I'm going to go
 
00:34:23.550 --> 00:34:23.560 align:start position:0%
ahead and recess HB
 
00:34:26.510 --> 00:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
1363 on the possibility that we can come
 
00:34:30.349 --> 00:34:30.359 align:start position:0%
back uh the last thing we do today to uh
 
00:34:32.109 --> 00:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
uh determine what we want to do with it
 
00:34:35.669 --> 00:34:35.679 align:start position:0%
if we want to um execute late today or
 
00:34:38.589 --> 00:34:38.599 align:start position:0%
if we want to uh carry it over to next
 
00:34:41.069 --> 00:34:41.079 align:start position:0%
week we can talk about that after we
 
00:34:43.869 --> 00:34:43.879 align:start position:0%
recess all right all right so um I'm
 
00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:46.720 align:start position:0%
going to put uh HB
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
1363 uh into the recess
 
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:54.200 align:start position:0%
mode thank you and with that uh I'm
 
00:34:59.510 --> 00:34:59.520 align:start position:0%
going to bring to uh forward word um
 
00:35:03.349 --> 00:35:03.359 align:start position:0%
1282 Rel relative to the duration of
 
00:35:03.359 --> 00:35:05.829 align:start position:0%
1282 Rel relative to the duration of
Child

okay last week uh you indicated a number
 
00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
of questions surrounding the IT
 
00:36:37.030 --> 00:36:37.040 align:start position:0%
solutions I just wanted to address those
 
00:36:39.829 --> 00:36:39.839 align:start position:0%
today and and just so you know we did
 
00:36:42.790 --> 00:36:42.800 align:start position:0%
that systemically we said all of these
 
00:36:45.190 --> 00:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
bills before us have like an IT
 
00:36:47.950 --> 00:36:47.960 align:start position:0%
component go take a look at the totality
 
00:36:50.150 --> 00:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
coordinate the totality and come back to
 
00:36:53.270 --> 00:36:53.280 align:start position:0%
us to tell us the implications on cost
 
00:36:56.270 --> 00:36:56.280 align:start position:0%
and and and implementation timing I I
 
00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
think that's what that was right that is
 
00:37:01.309 --> 00:37:01.319 align:start position:0%
correct thank you I do have a handout
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
however it's not whole punched if you
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:13.589 --> 00:37:13.599 align:start position:0%
no my apologies for the lack of ho
 
00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:16.680 align:start position:0%
punches um so the handout actually goes
 
00:37:18.109 --> 00:37:18.119 align:start position:0%
through a number of bills as you
 
00:37:21.470 --> 00:37:21.480 align:start position:0%
indicated chairman um in particular for
 
00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:22.630 align:start position:0%
indicated chairman um in particular for
HB

00:37:22.630 --> 00:37:22.640 align:start position:0%
HB
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
1282 we looked at this solution and in
 
00:37:27.550 --> 00:37:27.560 align:start position:0%
order to implement these changes we need
 
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:29.800 align:start position:0%
to amend the existing contract with our
 
00:37:32.309 --> 00:37:32.319 align:start position:0%
vendor to support the child support
 
00:37:35.190 --> 00:37:35.200 align:start position:0%
system that process takes about six
 
00:37:36.990 --> 00:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
months to do amendments working with our
 
00:37:39.630 --> 00:37:39.640 align:start position:0%
federal Partners as well as our state
 
00:37:42.109 --> 00:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
procurement practices and then following
 
00:37:43.550 --> 00:37:43.560 align:start position:0%
that six months we would need an
 
00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
additional six months for implementation
 
00:37:49.069 --> 00:37:49.079 align:start position:0%
of these changes so with that the
 
00:37:51.430 --> 00:37:51.440 align:start position:0%
effective date would be that we could be
 
00:37:54.829 --> 00:37:54.839 align:start position:0%
able to meet the um the requirements of
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
this bill would be a July 1st
 
00:38:00.230 --> 00:38:00.240 align:start position:0%
2025 in which point we would be able to
 
00:38:02.270 --> 00:38:02.280 align:start position:0%
go live with those changes to support
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
this this
 
00:38:07.950 --> 00:38:07.960 align:start position:0%
bill in response to the question as to
 
00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:09.880 align:start position:0%
whether or not we have the projects
 
00:38:11.790 --> 00:38:11.800 align:start position:0%
related to this bill resourced and
 
00:38:13.829 --> 00:38:13.839 align:start position:0%
prioritized in our project management
 
00:38:16.670 --> 00:38:16.680 align:start position:0%
system assuming the bill passage the
 
00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
department would submit it through our
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
pmo process and I identify the resources
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
needed to move this
 
00:38:26.790 --> 00:38:26.800 align:start position:0%
forward what's what's your confidence
 
00:38:28.870 --> 00:38:28.880 align:start position:0%
level you just said 6 months plus 6
 
00:38:32.470 --> 00:38:32.480 align:start position:0%
months um is do do you need do you need
 
00:38:34.870 --> 00:38:34.880 align:start position:0%
an extra cushion of time in there or are
 
00:38:37.870 --> 00:38:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:40.069 --> 00:38:40.079 align:start position:0%
confident we think we're okay we're
 
00:38:41.710 --> 00:38:41.720 align:start position:0%
we're highly confident that we'd be able
 
00:38:43.470 --> 00:38:43.480 align:start position:0%
to achieve these changes in that
 
00:38:46.750 --> 00:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
timeline okay did you have a revised
 
00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
cost estimate no the cost estimate
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
that's in this promote is the same okay
 
00:38:54.430 --> 00:38:54.440 align:start position:0%
so it would just slide the spending
 
00:38:58.030 --> 00:38:58.040 align:start position:0%
maybe okay um um are there any questions
 
00:39:01.870 --> 00:39:01.880 align:start position:0%
about 1282 the only financial impact on
 
00:39:06.950 --> 00:39:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:10.550 --> 00:39:10.560 align:start position:0%
implementation not I'm not seeing any so
 
00:39:12.030 --> 00:39:12.040 align:start position:0%
um I'll give it another minute for
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
people to look at it representative tki
 
00:39:15.510 --> 00:39:15.520 align:start position:0%
I just have a question and I apologize
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
that I wasn't here um last week and I
 
00:39:22.950 --> 00:39:22.960 align:start position:0%
was I caught a little bit of it um these
 
00:39:25.430 --> 00:39:25.440 align:start position:0%
this list of that you have here that you
 
00:39:28.030 --> 00:39:28.040 align:start position:0%
reviewed and I apologize again if I this
 
00:39:30.750 --> 00:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
has been stated um is the fiscal note on
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
this is it the changes that are going to
 
00:39:34.630 --> 00:39:34.640 align:start position:0%
have to be done to the the technology
 
00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:38.040 align:start position:0%
side um is it the same cost for all of
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
them in other words it's not an
 
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:42.720 align:start position:0%
individual cost on each bill it's you're
 
00:39:45.390 --> 00:39:45.400 align:start position:0%
going to have a larger package to revise
 
00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.069 align:start position:0%
going to have a larger package to revise
your

00:39:47.069 --> 00:39:47.079 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:39:49.750 --> 00:39:49.760 align:start position:0%
software that is a good question in the
 
00:39:51.950 --> 00:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
case of these systems they're individual
 
00:39:53.829 --> 00:39:53.839 align:start position:0%
so each bill impacts different systems
 
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:55.560 align:start position:0%
within the department we have a little
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
over 200 application systems that we
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
support in the case of this bill it's um
 
00:40:02.390 --> 00:40:02.400 align:start position:0%
the New England Child Support
 
00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:04.920 align:start position:0%
Enforcement system that is impacted and
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
so other bills will impact impact other
 
00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:09.839 align:start position:0%
systems so this is a individual Bill
 
00:40:12.829 --> 00:40:12.839 align:start position:0%
cost okay could sorry follow up um was
 
00:40:15.550 --> 00:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
just comparing this one
 
00:40:18.349 --> 00:40:18.359 align:start position:0%
to now I got to find the right one and
 
00:40:20.550 --> 00:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
it had an identical fiscal note in terms
 
00:40:22.069 --> 00:40:22.079 align:start position:0%
of the numbers so I was wondering if it
 
00:40:25.349 --> 00:40:25.359 align:start position:0%
was that amount to revise the system
 
00:40:25.359 --> 00:40:27.870 align:start position:0%
was that amount to revise the system
for

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:27.880 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.990 align:start position:0%
for
for

00:40:28.990 --> 00:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:40:32.069 --> 00:40:32.079 align:start position:0%
both but that's okay maybe I was looking
 
00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:36.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.990 --> 00:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
question um I I I think that was a good
 
00:40:43.230 --> 00:40:43.240 align:start position:0%
observation there there were uh as Mr
 
00:40:46.030 --> 00:40:46.040 align:start position:0%
weer said most of these bills are
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
touching different it systems but there
 
00:40:50.550 --> 00:40:50.560 align:start position:0%
were two bills that were touching the
 
00:40:53.950 --> 00:40:53.960 align:start position:0%
same system this particular system and I
 
00:40:56.750 --> 00:40:56.760 align:start position:0%
think the cost estimates were the same
 
00:41:01.670 --> 00:41:01.680 align:start position:0%
but but but and but we should keep them
 
00:41:04.390 --> 00:41:04.400 align:start position:0%
independent as each bill tries to go
 
00:41:06.230 --> 00:41:06.240 align:start position:0%
through the system I just wanted to make
 
00:41:08.670 --> 00:41:08.680 align:start position:0%
sure that the department had had an
 
00:41:10.990 --> 00:41:11.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity to take a look at the whole
 
00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:13.240 align:start position:0%
the whole impact if they had to do all
 
00:41:14.589 --> 00:41:14.599 align:start position:0%
of the it
 
00:41:17.270 --> 00:41:17.280 align:start position:0%
systems because the the their scarcest
 
00:41:19.710 --> 00:41:19.720 align:start position:0%
resources really isn't the money it's
 
00:41:21.790 --> 00:41:21.800 align:start position:0%
making sure that they have the trained
 
00:41:24.589 --> 00:41:24.599 align:start position:0%
project management people and the the
 
00:41:28.069 --> 00:41:28.079 align:start position:0%
team ready to go so
 
00:41:31.190 --> 00:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
so good good good good question
 
00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:34.560 align:start position:0%
uh I I um I don't have any more
 
00:41:37.109 --> 00:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
questions on 1282 does anyone have
 
00:41:40.030 --> 00:41:40.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:42.710 --> 00:41:42.720 align:start position:0%
1282 representative Mooney thank you Mr
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
chair we did discuss amending the
 
00:41:45.359 --> 00:41:48.030 align:start position:0%
chair we did discuss amending the
effective

00:41:48.030 --> 00:41:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:52.640 align:start position:0%
date what we did last time discuss
 
00:41:55.230 --> 00:41:55.240 align:start position:0%
amending the effective
 
00:41:58.470 --> 00:41:58.480 align:start position:0%
date so so yes is there a question there
 
00:42:00.990 --> 00:42:01.000 align:start position:0%
there I don't think I think if we if we
 
00:42:02.990 --> 00:42:03.000 align:start position:0%
decide we want to go forward it probably
 
00:42:04.990 --> 00:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
needs an amendment
 
00:42:07.510 --> 00:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
right correct I didn't know if you were
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
gearing up to make a move right now but
 
00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:13.440 align:start position:0%
I I'd like to get through the three
 
00:42:15.829 --> 00:42:15.839 align:start position:0%
child support ones and then and then
 
00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
maybe loop back around to see if we have
 
00:42:24.069 --> 00:42:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh thoughts on uh exec the the each bill
 
00:42:25.950 --> 00:42:25.960 align:start position:0%
because we have to probably exec each
 
00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:27.270 align:start position:0%
because we have to probably exec each
bill

00:42:27.270 --> 00:42:27.280 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:42:29.069 --> 00:42:29.079 align:start position:0%
um but I want to go through the three
 
00:42:33.190 --> 00:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:35.589 --> 00:42:35.599 align:start position:0%
at any other
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
questions okay so do you want to just
 
00:42:44.430 --> 00:42:44.440 align:start position:0%
drop down to um 1595 which I think is
 
00:42:47.630 --> 00:42:47.640 align:start position:0%
the other uh one operating on the same
 
00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:49.990 align:start position:0%
the other uh one operating on the same
it

00:42:49.990 --> 00:42:50.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:42:54.549 --> 00:42:54.559 align:start position:0%
system 15595 I think if I'm
 
00:42:56.910 --> 00:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
wrong I could be wrong
 
00:43:00.430 --> 00:43:00.440 align:start position:0%
um 1595 is on the same Child Support
 
00:43:03.349 --> 00:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
Enforcement system we we call it Nexus
 
00:43:06.870 --> 00:43:06.880 align:start position:0%
for short um so if you ever hear the
 
00:43:08.990 --> 00:43:09.000 align:start position:0%
acronym Nexus it it does down for New
 
00:43:11.190 --> 00:43:11.200 align:start position:0%
England Child Support Enforcement system
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
1595 in 1564 have the exact same um
 
00:43:18.630 --> 00:43:18.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact into the system and
 
00:43:21.430 --> 00:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
depending on if they both move forward
 
00:43:23.910 --> 00:43:23.920 align:start position:0%
um we would have some conflicts however
 
00:43:25.829 --> 00:43:25.839 align:start position:0%
if they were merged together we would
 
00:43:30.190 --> 00:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:33.390 --> 00:43:33.400 align:start position:0%
$290,000 and when it comes to effective
 
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
date it follows the same challenges that
 
00:43:37.790 --> 00:43:37.800 align:start position:0%
we have with the previous Bill where we
 
00:43:39.470 --> 00:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
would need to amend the existing
 
00:43:42.750 --> 00:43:42.760 align:start position:0%
contract for services to accommodate
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
those changes which would have a ability
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
for the Department to implement with an
 
00:43:51.790 --> 00:43:51.800 align:start position:0%
effective date of July 1st
 
00:43:54.829 --> 00:43:54.839 align:start position:0%
2025 um to address the same question of
 
00:43:56.950 --> 00:43:56.960 align:start position:0%
the previous Bill we do have confidence
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
that if we had the two bills move
 
00:44:01.349 --> 00:44:01.359 align:start position:0%
forward we would have the resources to
 
00:44:05.030 --> 00:44:05.040 align:start position:0%
be able to move both Solutions
 
00:44:07.309 --> 00:44:07.319 align:start position:0%
forward all right
 
00:44:13.069 --> 00:44:13.079 align:start position:0%
um for the uh go go ahead representative
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
walner my my question is really for
 
00:44:21.950 --> 00:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.150 --> 00:44:25.160 align:start position:0%
technical so my my my question is I just
 
00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:28.160 align:start position:0%
heard the word merge them together and
 
00:44:32.030 --> 00:44:32.040 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering are they compatible can
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
they be merged together if you merge
 
00:44:34.480 --> 00:44:35.349 align:start position:0%
they be merged together if you merge
them

00:44:35.349 --> 00:44:35.359 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:44:37.790 --> 00:44:37.800 align:start position:0%
together what does that mean then
 
00:44:39.870 --> 00:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
because that seems like again that seems
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
like a policy issue of merging them
 
00:44:45.069 --> 00:44:45.079 align:start position:0%
together thank you for your question it
 
00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:46.680 align:start position:0%
definitely a policy issue I think there
 
00:44:51.109 --> 00:44:51.119 align:start position:0%
are parts of them that can be merge
 
00:44:55.069 --> 00:44:55.079 align:start position:0%
together um but then other parts that
 
00:44:55.079 --> 00:44:57.109 align:start position:0%
together um but then other parts that
definitely

00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
definitely
 
00:45:03.750 --> 00:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
conflict so we if conflict or are just
 
00:45:06.710 --> 00:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
um they're not aligned with each other
 
00:45:08.950 --> 00:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
do they actually conflict and fight each
 
00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:13.400 align:start position:0%
other or or or do they match up except
 
00:45:15.390 --> 00:45:15.400 align:start position:0%
where they don't no I would say that
 
00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:21.950 align:start position:0%
 
certain

00:45:21.950 --> 00:45:21.960 align:start position:0%
certain
 
00:45:24.109 --> 00:45:24.119 align:start position:0%
circumstances described circumstances
 
00:45:26.829 --> 00:45:26.839 align:start position:0%
for child support that are different in
 
00:45:29.710 --> 00:45:29.720 align:start position:0%
one building in the
 
00:45:32.309 --> 00:45:32.319 align:start position:0%
other thank thank thanks for that and
 
00:45:35.790 --> 00:45:35.800 align:start position:0%
and so on 1595 has an amendment uh the
 
00:45:39.190 --> 00:45:39.200 align:start position:0%
bigford amendment uh
 
00:45:39.200 --> 00:45:41.430 align:start position:0%
bigford amendment uh
20241

00:45:41.430 --> 00:45:41.440 align:start position:0%
20241
 
00:45:44.589 --> 00:45:44.599 align:start position:0%
014 um uh representative Bickford would
 
00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:46.760 align:start position:0%
would you sit over here and grab a mic
 
00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:48.920 align:start position:0%
over on the on the
 
00:45:52.109 --> 00:45:52.119 align:start position:0%
side no you don't have to get up
 
00:45:54.710 --> 00:45:54.720 align:start position:0%
ma'am if you want to get more notes to
 
00:45:58.950 --> 00:45:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:02.030 --> 00:46:02.040 align:start position:0%
okay have have you I'm I'm sorry I'm so
 
00:46:06.309 --> 00:46:06.319 align:start position:0%
bad with names ma'am uh you're have you
 
00:46:08.830 --> 00:46:08.840 align:start position:0%
seen representative Bickford's
 
00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:10.030 align:start position:0%
seen representative Bickford's
[Music]

00:46:10.030 --> 00:46:10.040 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:46:16.190 --> 00:46:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:19.470 --> 00:46:19.480 align:start position:0%
Ends and so because you pointed out a
 
00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.150 align:start position:0%
Ends and so because you pointed out a
potential

00:46:21.150 --> 00:46:21.160 align:start position:0%
potential
 
00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:24.400 align:start position:0%
conflict uh I wanted I I I will come
 
00:46:26.390 --> 00:46:26.400 align:start position:0%
back to you after you've had a chance to
 
00:46:29.030 --> 00:46:29.040 align:start position:0%
think about it and see if that in your
 
00:46:31.270 --> 00:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
mind resolves the potential conflicts
 
00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:33.400 align:start position:0%
that we might have between these two
 
00:46:36.790 --> 00:46:36.800 align:start position:0%
bills all right uh representative
 
00:46:38.390 --> 00:46:38.400 align:start position:0%
bigford what what would you like to tell
 
00:46:41.150 --> 00:46:41.160 align:start position:0%
us about your Amendment
 
00:46:43.589 --> 00:46:43.599 align:start position:0%
sir what what the amendment does is pick
 
00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:46.240 align:start position:0%
up the uh self support
 
00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:47.950 align:start position:0%
up the uh self support
res

00:46:47.950 --> 00:46:47.960 align:start position:0%
res
 
00:46:50.630 --> 00:46:50.640 align:start position:0%
closer what it does is picks up the self
 
00:46:52.829 --> 00:46:52.839 align:start position:0%
support Reserve from
 
00:46:55.470 --> 00:46:55.480 align:start position:0%
1564 and it puts in a domestic violence
 
00:46:58.910 --> 00:46:58.920 align:start position:0%
uh CL clause in there that 1564 also has
 
00:47:00.750 --> 00:47:00.760 align:start position:0%
but what we need to do is decide on
 
00:47:03.230 --> 00:47:03.240 align:start position:0%
which child support formula we're going
 
00:47:08.390 --> 00:47:08.400 align:start position:0%
to go with the one 1595 has a formula
 
00:47:11.510 --> 00:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
that's recommended by years of study
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
we've spend hundreds of thousands of
 
00:47:15.309 --> 00:47:15.319 align:start position:0%
dollars on these studies that I pointed
 
00:47:18.190 --> 00:47:18.200 align:start position:0%
out to you the last time which has a
 
00:47:22.990 --> 00:47:23.000 align:start position:0%
what they call a 1.5 multiplier in it uh
 
00:47:26.470 --> 00:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
the one in 1564 is a simple uh cross
 
00:47:29.069 --> 00:47:29.079 align:start position:0%
credit and it only works when you have
 
00:47:31.630 --> 00:47:31.640 align:start position:0%
the exact same income and the exact same
 
00:47:34.670 --> 00:47:34.680 align:start position:0%
parenting time after
 
00:47:38.750 --> 00:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
that it it will you'll find the um the
 
00:47:42.470 --> 00:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
lower earner will start moving away from
 
00:47:45.950 --> 00:47:45.960 align:start position:0%
even having an even with the other party
 
00:47:49.630 --> 00:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
so it it does damage the uh lower earner
 
00:47:51.549 --> 00:47:51.559 align:start position:0%
the one the cross it's called cross
 
00:47:54.870 --> 00:47:54.880 align:start position:0%
credit and it's just it's a simple thing
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
um but it's not recommended by all the
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
studies that we
 
00:48:02.750 --> 00:48:02.760 align:start position:0%
have the uh the one
 
00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:06.680 align:start position:0%
we so so sticking on the amendment it
 
00:48:10.430 --> 00:48:10.440 align:start position:0%
it's lines 17 through 20 what are the
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
what was the purpose for this what are
 
00:48:13.589 --> 00:48:13.599 align:start position:0%
we trying to do with with that with
 
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
those lines well you had spoke about
 
00:48:17.870 --> 00:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
having one bill going with follow one
 
00:48:19.829 --> 00:48:19.839 align:start position:0%
bill and this would do it but you would
 
00:48:23.309 --> 00:48:23.319 align:start position:0%
not be going far with 1564 anymore okay
 
00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
so this would allow 1595 to to carry the
 
00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:27.870 align:start position:0%
so this would allow 1595 to to carry the
load

00:48:27.870 --> 00:48:27.880 align:start position:0%
load
 
00:48:31.030 --> 00:48:31.040 align:start position:0%
exactly okay does does the department
 
00:48:34.150 --> 00:48:34.160 align:start position:0%
concur with that
 
00:48:36.750 --> 00:48:36.760 align:start position:0%
that I would I would say that it I mean
 
00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:39.680 align:start position:0%
it definitely includes things from 1564
 
00:48:42.710 --> 00:48:42.720 align:start position:0%
that it did not before
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm loathed to say it completely
 
00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:48.240 align:start position:0%
deals with it with the prime sponsor in
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
the room I mean she might have a
 
00:48:51.710 --> 00:48:51.720 align:start position:0%
different she might have a different
 
00:48:53.789 --> 00:48:53.799 align:start position:0%
opinion but
 
00:48:57.069 --> 00:48:57.079 align:start position:0%
uh all right so so we don't we we can
 
00:48:59.950 --> 00:48:59.960 align:start position:0%
bring you back on this we can we can
 
00:49:02.789 --> 00:49:02.799 align:start position:0%
either recess it for later today or if
 
00:49:04.950 --> 00:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
you think you guys need some time to to
 
00:49:07.430 --> 00:49:07.440 align:start position:0%
continue to resolve it we're going to
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
have another work session next week
 
00:49:12.789 --> 00:49:12.799 align:start position:0%
where I hope it uh concludes in an exec
 
00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:16.839 align:start position:0%
session so so any sort of U disputes
 
00:49:19.750 --> 00:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
between the two uh we should be prepared
 
00:49:21.510 --> 00:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
to handle
 
00:49:24.270 --> 00:49:24.280 align:start position:0%
uh what I want to I want to ask the
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
chair did you want to comment on either
 
00:49:30.069 --> 00:49:30.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.150 --> 00:49:33.160 align:start position:0%
kab it was that a no you do
 
00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:44.710 align:start position:0%
 
sure

00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:44.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:47.109 --> 00:49:47.119 align:start position:0%
okay good morning for the record I'm
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
kitlyn cab thank you for hearing me so
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
basically the special committee on the
 
00:49:55.349 --> 00:49:55.359 align:start position:0%
Family Court heard a lot of testimony
 
00:49:57.150 --> 00:49:57.160 align:start position:0%
from from parents that there's long been
 
00:50:00.470 --> 00:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
a child support issue in New Hampshire
 
00:50:04.349 --> 00:50:04.359 align:start position:0%
and I looked back and we've had over a
 
00:50:06.510 --> 00:50:06.520 align:start position:0%
dozen bills come through and every year
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
we'll get something through the house
 
00:50:09.589 --> 00:50:09.599 align:start position:0%
and it gets to the Senate and it gets
 
00:50:12.470 --> 00:50:12.480 align:start position:0%
ited so knowing that parents really
 
00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
needed something I brought together all
 
00:50:16.390 --> 00:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders over the summer we had
 
00:50:18.710 --> 00:50:18.720 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Association of Justice we
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
had New Hampshire legal aids several
 
00:50:22.950 --> 00:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
Family Court attorneys mediators we got
 
00:50:24.190 --> 00:50:24.200 align:start position:0%
everybody together to come up with
 
00:50:26.230 --> 00:50:26.240 align:start position:0%
something that would work we also ran
 
00:50:28.829 --> 00:50:28.839 align:start position:0%
this by a few of the judges just to make
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
sure that we're putting in something
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
where we're not going to you know break
 
00:50:35.829 --> 00:50:35.839 align:start position:0%
the 80% that are agreeing that are going
 
00:50:38.510 --> 00:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
through mediation but in in trying to
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
correct it for the 20% who aren't
 
00:50:42.150 --> 00:50:42.160 align:start position:0%
agreeing and this was the bill that we
 
00:50:44.430 --> 00:50:44.440 align:start position:0%
came up with and it and it fix it fixes
 
00:50:46.630 --> 00:50:46.640 align:start position:0%
three of the the big issues that have
 
00:50:48.870 --> 00:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
kind of come out which one of them was
 
00:50:50.789 --> 00:50:50.799 align:start position:0%
increasing the self-support reserve from
 
00:50:52.910 --> 00:50:52.920 align:start position:0%
115% to
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
130% and then it allows for the parties
 
00:50:57.910 --> 00:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
to um share the cost of child care
 
00:50:59.430 --> 00:50:59.440 align:start position:0%
Healthcare and extracurricular
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
activities that are agreed upon and then
 
00:51:03.109 --> 00:51:03.119 align:start position:0%
it allows for some rebuttable
 
00:51:05.309 --> 00:51:05.319 align:start position:0%
presumptions of deviations to the child
 
00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
support calculator based on shared
 
00:51:09.950 --> 00:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
parenting time and it was really one of
 
00:51:12.510 --> 00:51:12.520 align:start position:0%
the big sticking points and if if you
 
00:51:14.829 --> 00:51:14.839 align:start position:0%
kind of look back it this bill came out
 
00:51:18.430 --> 00:51:18.440 align:start position:0%
of committee 13 to0 verse 1595 came out
 
00:51:22.510 --> 00:51:22.520 align:start position:0%
of committee 7 to6 um we couldn't get
 
00:51:24.549 --> 00:51:24.559 align:start position:0%
agreement on changing a whole calculator
 
00:51:26.990 --> 00:51:27.000 align:start position:0%
solely just based on parenting time
 
00:51:27.870 --> 00:51:27.880 align:start position:0%
because then you were going to have
 
00:51:30.950 --> 00:51:30.960 align:start position:0%
parents arguing hour for hour about how
 
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
much time they're spending with each
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
kiddo and so that was kind of one of the
 
00:51:36.430 --> 00:51:36.440 align:start position:0%
big sticking points
 
00:51:38.789 --> 00:51:38.799 align:start position:0%
from New Hampshire legal aid and the
 
00:51:40.870 --> 00:51:40.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence Coalition they wanted
 
00:51:42.510 --> 00:51:42.520 align:start position:0%
it to truly be in the best interest of
 
00:51:45.270 --> 00:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
the child and so this was the Compromise
 
00:51:47.750 --> 00:51:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we came up with and I really think
 
00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.990 align:start position:0%
that we came up with and I really think
you

00:51:49.990 --> 00:51:50.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:53.829 --> 00:51:53.839 align:start position:0%
know it has uh I think it'll be good for
 
00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:55.880 align:start position:0%
for the for the families in the state of
 
00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.829 align:start position:0%
for the for the families in the state of
New

00:51:56.829 --> 00:51:56.839 align:start position:0%
New
 
00:51:59.630 --> 00:51:59.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire all right so when you say this
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
is the compromise 1564 is the compromise
 
00:52:07.109 --> 00:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
1564 is the compromise correct and and
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
so am I hearing you right there that
 
00:52:09.680 --> 00:52:10.670 align:start position:0%
so am I hearing you right there that
your

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
your
 
00:52:13.349 --> 00:52:13.359 align:start position:0%
recommendation from your committee from
 
00:52:16.470 --> 00:52:16.480 align:start position:0%
from policy perspective is that we ought
 
00:52:22.030 --> 00:52:22.040 align:start position:0%
to be passing 1564 and and not either
 
00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:26.280 align:start position:0%
1282 or 1595 so 12 1282 deals with
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
something entirely different it's okay
 
00:52:30.430 --> 00:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
to pass 1282 is is completely different
 
00:52:32.829 --> 00:52:32.839 align:start position:0%
okay so the so the the conflict is
 
00:52:38.230 --> 00:52:38.240 align:start position:0%
between 64 and 95 correct okay all right
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
um representative Wallner you had a
 
00:52:43.670 --> 00:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
question well I guess my question is now
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
to to both but I was wondering uh when
 
00:52:49.309 --> 00:52:49.319 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford was here and he
 
00:52:51.510 --> 00:52:51.520 align:start position:0%
has an amendment is this an amendment
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
that the children and family law
 
00:52:56.190 --> 00:52:56.200 align:start position:0%
committee has seen and
 
00:52:58.829 --> 00:52:58.839 align:start position:0%
support or is this an amendment from the
 
00:52:58.839 --> 00:53:00.990 align:start position:0%
support or is this an amendment from the
sponsor

00:53:00.990 --> 00:53:01.000 align:start position:0%
sponsor
 
00:53:03.150 --> 00:53:03.160 align:start position:0%
no no to
 
00:53:06.990 --> 00:53:07.000 align:start position:0%
which well the no it does well I don't
 
00:53:08.870 --> 00:53:08.880 align:start position:0%
know about support because they never
 
00:53:10.829 --> 00:53:10.839 align:start position:0%
they've seen it in six it's just taking
 
00:53:13.349 --> 00:53:13.359 align:start position:0%
stuff out of 1564 and putting this so I
 
00:53:14.950 --> 00:53:14.960 align:start position:0%
guess yes the answer is yes it has seen
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
it and I would have to say yes it does
 
00:53:20.030 --> 00:53:20.040 align:start position:0%
approve what's in the
 
00:53:24.510 --> 00:53:24.520 align:start position:0%
amendment okay and do the members of or
 
00:53:27.230 --> 00:53:27.240 align:start position:0%
at least a portion of the members of the
 
00:53:29.990 --> 00:53:30.000 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee know
 
00:53:31.430 --> 00:53:31.440 align:start position:0%
that you're bringing forth this
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
amendment to finance because it's a
 
00:53:38.030 --> 00:53:38.040 align:start position:0%
policy and I am no concern no we we have
 
00:53:41.190 --> 00:53:41.200 align:start position:0%
not met since I came here last okay
 
00:53:43.750 --> 00:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and I heard about having one
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
one bill so this this uh we'll achieve a
 
00:53:51.670 --> 00:53:51.680 align:start position:0%
one bill thing I mean the the the
 
00:53:55.710 --> 00:53:55.720 align:start position:0%
problem is she bring fall one bill with
 
00:53:59.470 --> 00:53:59.480 align:start position:0%
a uh calculator or formula in it and I
 
00:54:01.470 --> 00:54:01.480 align:start position:0%
challenge that and say that those people
 
00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:05.160 align:start position:0%
did not utilize this which we paid
 
00:54:08.230 --> 00:54:08.240 align:start position:0%
$114,000 to tell us what to give us a
 
00:54:11.230 --> 00:54:11.240 align:start position:0%
direction to go in and not only did this
 
00:54:12.990 --> 00:54:13.000 align:start position:0%
one do it we paid
 
00:54:15.789 --> 00:54:15.799 align:start position:0%
$140,000 for this one four years before
 
00:54:18.230 --> 00:54:18.240 align:start position:0%
that in the 19 and it says the same
 
00:54:20.670 --> 00:54:20.680 align:start position:0%
thing and then the family law task force
 
00:54:24.069 --> 00:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
in 2004 told us to do that and gave us
 
00:54:27.109 --> 00:54:27.119 align:start position:0%
recommendations same thing in
 
00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
2009 I mean it just goes back and back
 
00:54:32.630 --> 00:54:32.640 align:start position:0%
for over 20 years telling us that this
 
00:54:34.510 --> 00:54:34.520 align:start position:0%
formula that I'm bringing forward to you
 
00:54:39.549 --> 00:54:39.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:43.309 --> 00:54:43.319 align:start position:0%
adopting I I represent tki thank you um
 
00:54:45.470 --> 00:54:45.480 align:start position:0%
I would like to just direct a question
 
00:54:47.670 --> 00:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
to the uh experts here at the center of
 
00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:51.160 align:start position:0%
the table if I may um when I Was
 
00:54:53.190 --> 00:54:53.200 align:start position:0%
preparing for today I did have a couple
 
00:54:55.710 --> 00:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
conversations with members of children
 
00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:57.640 align:start position:0%
and family law to try to understand
 
00:54:59.829 --> 00:54:59.839 align:start position:0%
since we are not the policy committee on
 
00:55:03.270 --> 00:55:03.280 align:start position:0%
this and someone said very simply to me
 
00:55:06.910 --> 00:55:06.920 align:start position:0%
that 1264 uh sorry
 
00:55:11.710 --> 00:55:11.720 align:start position:0%
1564 is um they described it as the
 
00:55:14.549 --> 00:55:14.559 align:start position:0%
collaborative um you know all the
 
00:55:16.270 --> 00:55:16.280 align:start position:0%
parties coming together to work on it
 
00:55:19.710 --> 00:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
and said that it's a small step um it's
 
00:55:23.710 --> 00:55:23.720 align:start position:0%
a the changes are more um moderate um
 
00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:24.880 align:start position:0%
but there was a lot of agreement about
 
00:55:26.589 --> 00:55:26.599 align:start position:0%
it whereas they said
 
00:55:29.150 --> 00:55:29.160 align:start position:0%
1595 was like overturning the Apple card
 
00:55:32.750 --> 00:55:32.760 align:start position:0%
it was like a huge 180 from where um the
 
00:55:37.069 --> 00:55:37.079 align:start position:0%
process is now would that be a correct
 
00:55:41.150 --> 00:55:41.160 align:start position:0%
assessment I I I would say you want me
 
00:55:43.430 --> 00:55:43.440 align:start position:0%
to answer that no I was asking
 
00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
the I don't know know if DHHS wants to
 
00:55:49.630 --> 00:55:49.640 align:start position:0%
answer your question as worded do you
 
00:55:52.870 --> 00:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
want to reward your question
 
00:55:56.230 --> 00:55:56.240 align:start position:0%
which I'm trying to understand and which
 
00:55:58.349 --> 00:55:58.359 align:start position:0%
one is a more
 
00:56:03.390 --> 00:56:03.400 align:start position:0%
significant change to current um
 
00:56:06.829 --> 00:56:06.839 align:start position:0%
practice and which one might be a um a
 
00:56:11.589 --> 00:56:11.599 align:start position:0%
step um in trying to fix the problems we
 
00:56:14.349 --> 00:56:14.359 align:start position:0%
have which one and one it seems to me
 
00:56:15.789 --> 00:56:15.799 align:start position:0%
from what I'm hearing one is a very
 
00:56:18.190 --> 00:56:18.200 align:start position:0%
large shift from where we are now and
 
00:56:23.910 --> 00:56:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:27.190 align:start position:0%
 
step

00:56:27.190 --> 00:56:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.990 --> 00:56:31.000 align:start position:0%
I would say that that 1564 is definitely
 
00:56:32.870 --> 00:56:32.880 align:start position:0%
uh a simpler
 
00:56:36.029 --> 00:56:36.039 align:start position:0%
change it's leaving in place most of
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
what we do now and only changes it in
 
00:56:41.789 --> 00:56:41.799 align:start position:0%
certain shared
 
00:56:41.799 --> 00:56:44.630 align:start position:0%
certain shared
parenting

00:56:44.630 --> 00:56:44.640 align:start position:0%
parenting
 
00:56:46.789 --> 00:56:46.799 align:start position:0%
circumstances but it doesn't give any
 
00:56:48.950 --> 00:56:48.960 align:start position:0%
guidance in
 
00:56:51.990 --> 00:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
other circumstances whereas
 
00:56:55.670 --> 00:56:55.680 align:start position:0%
1595 deals with all the circumstances
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
that answers my question so so so I
 
00:57:01.589 --> 00:57:01.599 align:start position:0%
think for the record I I should have um
 
00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:05.200 align:start position:0%
probably gone ahead and open 1282
 
00:57:08.870 --> 00:57:08.880 align:start position:0%
1564 and 1595 we kind of talked about
 
00:57:11.230 --> 00:57:11.240 align:start position:0%
them all uh which is which is good we
 
00:57:14.190 --> 00:57:14.200 align:start position:0%
are a work session so we're working uh
 
00:57:17.150 --> 00:57:17.160 align:start position:0%
representative Hull thank you Mr chair
 
00:57:20.390 --> 00:57:20.400 align:start position:0%
um in my pile of handouts was a document
 
00:57:23.589 --> 00:57:23.599 align:start position:0%
comparing some of these with specific
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
information in various C colums but
 
00:57:27.510 --> 00:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately no one told me who turned
 
00:57:30.990 --> 00:57:31.000 align:start position:0%
that in do we know does anybody remember
 
00:57:33.950 --> 00:57:33.960 align:start position:0%
this document here who submitted that as
 
00:57:36.230 --> 00:57:36.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that young lady over there
 
00:57:40.910 --> 00:57:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:43.510 --> 00:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
you you had your hand up first was that
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
the same
 
00:57:48.870 --> 00:57:48.880 align:start position:0%
answer you you present you prepared the
 
00:57:53.150 --> 00:57:53.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:57.029 --> 00:57:57.039 align:start position:0%
you would I'd like to if I may answer
 
00:57:58.750 --> 00:57:58.760 align:start position:0%
question also for go ahead
 
00:58:01.309 --> 00:58:01.319 align:start position:0%
representative delki um yes they're
 
00:58:04.190 --> 00:58:04.200 align:start position:0%
absolutely right this is a much uh 1595
 
00:58:05.470 --> 00:58:05.480 align:start position:0%
is a much more
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
comprehensive uh bill that covers uh
 
00:58:11.549 --> 00:58:11.559 align:start position:0%
child support um one of the other
 
00:58:14.069 --> 00:58:14.079 align:start position:0%
problems with 1564 is it's it's very
 
00:58:16.390 --> 00:58:16.400 align:start position:0%
likely to drive the deviations up and
 
00:58:18.109 --> 00:58:18.119 align:start position:0%
the reason for these reports that we are
 
00:58:18.119 --> 00:58:19.309 align:start position:0%
the reason for these reports that we are
required

00:58:19.309 --> 00:58:19.319 align:start position:0%
required
 
00:58:22.349 --> 00:58:22.359 align:start position:0%
to have is to find out where the
 
00:58:25.549 --> 00:58:25.559 align:start position:0%
deviations are and if we if I a get too
 
00:58:27.950 --> 00:58:27.960 align:start position:0%
high which they're very high
 
00:58:29.829 --> 00:58:29.839 align:start position:0%
now um when you don't when the
 
00:58:31.710 --> 00:58:31.720 align:start position:0%
guidelines doesn't work anymore for you
 
00:58:34.069 --> 00:58:34.079 align:start position:0%
say you do a shared parenting situation
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
uh the guidelines we have now is just
 
00:58:39.549 --> 00:58:39.559 align:start position:0%
for excuse me for a a one parent
 
00:58:43.069 --> 00:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
situation so like I think 41 states have
 
00:58:46.270 --> 00:58:46.280 align:start position:0%
changed in recognizing shared parenting
 
00:58:49.349 --> 00:58:49.359 align:start position:0%
and 21 states I think are doing this
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
style it's in the report and uh we have
 
00:58:55.950 --> 00:58:55.960 align:start position:0%
this this is very closely aligned with
 
00:58:57.710 --> 00:58:57.720 align:start position:0%
California and
 
00:59:00.150 --> 00:59:00.160 align:start position:0%
Oregon um now I forget what I was say oh
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
deviation deviation is yes when they
 
00:59:03.950 --> 00:59:03.960 align:start position:0%
when the guidelines just don't work for
 
00:59:05.390 --> 00:59:05.400 align:start position:0%
it they try to come up with something
 
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
different the uh Supreme Court came down
 
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:09.720 align:start position:0%
on the judges and said you can't be
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
doing that uh any these cross credits
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
anymore and so that's why we're here to
 
00:59:18.150 --> 00:59:18.160 align:start position:0%
come up with a formula like I say there
 
00:59:20.670 --> 00:59:20.680 align:start position:0%
are formulas out there that are in the
 
00:59:24.150 --> 00:59:24.160 align:start position:0%
in the system and uh this is a very
 
00:59:26.029 --> 00:59:26.039 align:start position:0%
popular one right
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
here uh does that help uh I I'll bet
 
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
attorney bristen can answer it better
 
00:59:31.950 --> 00:59:31.960 align:start position:0%
than I
 
00:59:34.470 --> 00:59:34.480 align:start position:0%
can I I think you were the primary
 
00:59:37.470 --> 00:59:37.480 align:start position:0%
recipient of that answer representative
 
00:59:40.910 --> 00:59:40.920 align:start position:0%
tersi but if if our deviations get too
 
00:59:42.870 --> 00:59:42.880 align:start position:0%
high they can come back as I understand
 
00:59:44.309 --> 00:59:44.319 align:start position:0%
and tell us you're going to have to make
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
some changes so if we're just doing very
 
00:59:49.829 --> 00:59:49.839 align:start position:0%
uh simplistic changes and they're going
 
00:59:51.910 --> 00:59:51.920 align:start position:0%
to be dependent upon the deviations
 
00:59:53.150 --> 00:59:53.160 align:start position:0%
there a good chance they'll come back
 
00:59:56.109 --> 00:59:56.119 align:start position:0%
and say you're out of compliance
 
00:59:58.069 --> 00:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
may I respond to
 
01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:00.440 align:start position:0%
that so in speaking with several of the
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
judges there would be no issue with 1564
 
01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
they'd be able to do it just fine I
 
01:00:07.230 --> 01:00:07.240 align:start position:0%
think you know one of the big concerns
 
01:00:09.670 --> 01:00:09.680 align:start position:0%
that came out is that we are not
 
01:00:13.029 --> 01:00:13.039 align:start position:0%
California or Oregon we do not have the
 
01:00:15.829 --> 01:00:15.839 align:start position:0%
types of uh welfare programs that those
 
01:00:20.470 --> 01:00:20.480 align:start position:0%
states have to support like um daycare
 
01:00:22.990 --> 01:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
subsidies and and various subsidies that
 
01:00:24.589 --> 01:00:24.599 align:start position:0%
those other states have and so there is
 
01:00:28.270 --> 01:00:28.280 align:start position:0%
concerns when you're reducing just
 
01:00:30.029 --> 01:00:30.039 align:start position:0%
across the board making such a big
 
01:00:31.630 --> 01:00:31.640 align:start position:0%
change like this that families aren't
 
01:00:33.750 --> 01:00:33.760 align:start position:0%
going to be able to
 
01:00:36.069 --> 01:00:36.079 align:start position:0%
afford the needs of their children and
 
01:00:38.029 --> 01:00:38.039 align:start position:0%
we have to remember that the children
 
01:00:40.549 --> 01:00:40.559 align:start position:0%
are the ultimate piece here that we need
 
01:00:42.069 --> 01:00:42.079 align:start position:0%
to focus on and so that's why there was
 
01:00:44.190 --> 01:00:44.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of push back and that's why each
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
time it gets over to the other side of
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
the wall it's been killed um we need to
 
01:00:49.549 --> 01:00:49.559 align:start position:0%
come up with kind of a more moderate
 
01:00:51.430 --> 01:00:51.440 align:start position:0%
approach to it and then if there's more
 
01:00:53.430 --> 01:00:53.440 align:start position:0%
that needs to be done then we work at it
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
a little bit more but to go from you
 
01:00:59.670 --> 01:00:59.680 align:start position:0%
know one way to completely flipping it
 
01:01:03.230 --> 01:01:03.240 align:start position:0%
around it does cause for some
 
01:01:05.589 --> 01:01:05.599 align:start position:0%
concern but in terms of the deviations
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
it would it would be right now they're
 
01:01:09.789 --> 01:01:09.799 align:start position:0%
not allowed to deviate because that
 
01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
that's what the statue
 
01:01:13.829 --> 01:01:13.839 align:start position:0%
says but this would be allowing them to
 
01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:15.599 align:start position:0%
deviate so it would fix the problem and
 
01:01:18.190 --> 01:01:18.200 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be a problem with
 
01:01:21.589 --> 01:01:21.599 align:start position:0%
it are there any other comments from the
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
floor anyone in the audience would you
 
01:01:26.470 --> 01:01:26.480 align:start position:0%
like to come up you we haven't heard
 
01:01:30.150 --> 01:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
from you yet could you could I give you
 
01:01:33.430 --> 01:01:33.440 align:start position:0%
a couple seconds on deviations y every
 
01:01:34.910 --> 01:01:34.920 align:start position:0%
time you do a child support order at
 
01:01:36.349 --> 01:01:36.359 align:start position:0%
court you're required to do what's
 
01:01:38.829 --> 01:01:38.839 align:start position:0%
called a child support guidelines
 
01:01:43.069 --> 01:01:43.079 align:start position:0%
worksheet which fills out basic facts of
 
01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:45.520 align:start position:0%
the case and leads ultimately to the
 
01:01:47.390 --> 01:01:47.400 align:start position:0%
math the calculation of what the child
 
01:01:50.589 --> 01:01:50.599 align:start position:0%
support is supposed to
 
01:01:53.549 --> 01:01:53.559 align:start position:0%
be that number is the guidelines
 
01:01:56.150 --> 01:01:56.160 align:start position:0%
worksheet is provided to the court and
 
01:01:59.390 --> 01:01:59.400 align:start position:0%
is eventually will be attached to
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
file the so the court knows what that
 
01:02:05.069 --> 01:02:05.079 align:start position:0%
number is if the court chooses to pick a
 
01:02:07.269 --> 01:02:07.279 align:start position:0%
different number for whatever reason
 
01:02:08.150 --> 01:02:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's a
 
01:02:10.870 --> 01:02:10.880 align:start position:0%
deviation and those are the type of
 
01:02:13.510 --> 01:02:13.520 align:start position:0%
things that are that are
 
01:02:15.750 --> 01:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
tracked that that was helpful to me
 
01:02:15.760 --> 01:02:16.470 align:start position:0%
tracked that that was helpful to me
thank

01:02:16.470 --> 01:02:16.480 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:02:18.870 --> 01:02:18.880 align:start position:0%
you do you want to introduce yourself
 
01:02:20.950 --> 01:02:20.960 align:start position:0%
for the record and and tell us what you
 
01:02:23.309 --> 01:02:23.319 align:start position:0%
want to say uh sure my name is Rebecca
 
01:02:26.470 --> 01:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
Hutchins um I'm a mom of two from Dover
 
01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:29.640 align:start position:0%
um I was part of the working group for
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
1595 um we've spent a long time really
 
01:02:37.190 --> 01:02:37.200 align:start position:0%
reviewing the research and it's um I
 
01:02:40.510 --> 01:02:40.520 align:start position:0%
understand that we and you may have
 
01:02:43.670 --> 01:02:43.680 align:start position:0%
gotten my testimony from yesterday um I
 
01:02:46.190 --> 01:02:46.200 align:start position:0%
also sent in this chart that kind of
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
walks through each of the major areas I
 
01:02:52.549 --> 01:02:52.559 align:start position:0%
um I hear what Caitlyn uh representative
 
01:02:54.990 --> 01:02:55.000 align:start position:0%
cab excuse me is saying and
 
01:02:57.670 --> 01:02:57.680 align:start position:0%
and the issue is that the working group
 
01:03:01.710 --> 01:03:01.720 align:start position:0%
from 1564 did not include parents it
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
included a lot of litigators who go to
 
01:03:08.109 --> 01:03:08.119 align:start position:0%
court and try this all the time I've
 
01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:10.039 align:start position:0%
been back and forth to court in The Last
 
01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:12.520 align:start position:0%
5 Years to change my child support order
 
01:03:15.109 --> 01:03:15.119 align:start position:0%
six times because we don't have a tool
 
01:03:17.750 --> 01:03:17.760 align:start position:0%
that works for families that have shared
 
01:03:21.510 --> 01:03:21.520 align:start position:0%
parenting we continue to fight because
 
01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:22.390 align:start position:0%
parenting we continue to fight because
it

01:03:22.390 --> 01:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:03:25.430 --> 01:03:25.440 align:start position:0%
costs the same amount of money in two
 
01:03:28.109 --> 01:03:28.119 align:start position:0%
houses it costs more than what the child
 
01:03:30.069 --> 01:03:30.079 align:start position:0%
support calculator that we currently
 
01:03:34.990 --> 01:03:35.000 align:start position:0%
have shows so all of the funds I pay my
 
01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
ex I still also pay all of the
 
01:03:42.390 --> 01:03:42.400 align:start position:0%
extras I still care for my kids half of
 
01:03:44.990 --> 01:03:45.000 align:start position:0%
the time when we start talking about
 
01:03:47.029 --> 01:03:47.039 align:start position:0%
social services and what needs to happen
 
01:03:48.390 --> 01:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
because people are going to be getting
 
01:03:50.589 --> 01:03:50.599 align:start position:0%
less money what about the families that
 
01:03:53.910 --> 01:03:53.920 align:start position:0%
have been paying overpaying for over 20
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
years when this research has been out
 
01:03:58.029 --> 01:03:58.039 align:start position:0%
telling us that we need to change
 
01:04:02.670 --> 01:04:02.680 align:start position:0%
this there's no aers that I will
 
01:04:06.710 --> 01:04:06.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:09.390 --> 01:04:09.400 align:start position:0%
rectified and all it does is cause more
 
01:04:11.230 --> 01:04:11.240 align:start position:0%
fighting between
 
01:04:15.829 --> 01:04:15.839 align:start position:0%
families we were not included in 1564 I
 
01:04:17.549 --> 01:04:17.559 align:start position:0%
have reached out to the
 
01:04:20.670 --> 01:04:20.680 align:start position:0%
nhla I've reached out to the New
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association for
 
01:04:27.190 --> 01:04:27.200 align:start position:0%
justice my calls were not I did speak
 
01:04:30.990 --> 01:04:31.000 align:start position:0%
with Mary Krueger in in depth about the
 
01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:33.760 align:start position:0%
issues the the domestic violence issue
 
01:04:36.750 --> 01:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
that we've spoken of um
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
in conversation it seems that there are
 
01:04:41.870 --> 01:04:41.880 align:start position:0%
only four cases that it would actually
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.470 --> 01:04:50.480 align:start position:0%
nhla there's been conversations about
 
01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:53.200 align:start position:0%
course of control with financial
 
01:04:56.349 --> 01:04:56.359 align:start position:0%
situations I say it works both
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.870 --> 01:05:08.880 align:start position:0%
abuser sure I don't I don't want to I
 
01:05:11.870 --> 01:05:11.880 align:start position:0%
cause you to end prematurely I wish that
 
01:05:15.829 --> 01:05:15.839 align:start position:0%
I could convince you that so so let's
 
01:05:19.589 --> 01:05:19.599 align:start position:0%
back up sure so it it's your testimony
 
01:05:24.630 --> 01:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
that you think um parental involvement
 
01:05:27.589 --> 01:05:27.599 align:start position:0%
should cause us to want to pass1
 
01:05:30.470 --> 01:05:30.480 align:start position:0%
1595 and the lack of Parental
 
01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
involvement does that affect your
 
01:05:34.710 --> 01:05:34.720 align:start position:0%
position on
 
01:05:39.029 --> 01:05:39.039 align:start position:0%
1564 1564 only helps a very narrow group
 
01:05:41.710 --> 01:05:41.720 align:start position:0%
of people that already agree to share
 
01:05:45.670 --> 01:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
all costs 5050 it's the only group that
 
01:05:48.029 --> 01:05:48.039 align:start position:0%
they're working with okay I just I just
 
01:05:50.829 --> 01:05:50.839 align:start position:0%
wanted to get your position so yes or no
 
01:05:54.109 --> 01:05:54.119 align:start position:0%
to 1564 it seems to help some people if
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
if I'm hearing you right
 
01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.950 align:start position:0%
if I'm hearing you right
it

01:05:58.950 --> 01:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:06:02.990 --> 01:06:03.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:07.390 --> 01:06:07.400 align:start position:0%
1595 can be combined to create a tool if
 
01:06:11.789 --> 01:06:11.799 align:start position:0%
1564 is to pass as is there's a whole
 
01:06:14.190 --> 01:06:14.200 align:start position:0%
middle section section
 
01:06:16.870 --> 01:06:16.880 align:start position:0%
five that would cause more deviations
 
01:06:19.029 --> 01:06:19.039 align:start position:0%
which is absolutely against the review
 
01:06:21.470 --> 01:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
MH and cause more conflict for families
 
01:06:24.349 --> 01:06:24.359 align:start position:0%
trying to navigate this myself included
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
okay thank thank you and your last name
 
01:06:29.630 --> 01:06:29.640 align:start position:0%
is Hutchin or Huggin Hutchin Hutchin are
 
01:06:32.510 --> 01:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
there any questions from the panel for
 
01:06:35.029 --> 01:06:35.039 align:start position:0%
Miss Hutchins oh I
 
01:06:37.789 --> 01:06:37.799 align:start position:0%
do question for the chair can we get a
 
01:06:37.799 --> 01:06:38.910 align:start position:0%
do question for the chair can we get a
pink

01:06:38.910 --> 01:06:38.920 align:start position:0%
pink
 
01:06:41.390 --> 01:06:41.400 align:start position:0%
card I I don't know that our work
 
01:06:43.750 --> 01:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
sessions use pink cards Mr Ripple do we
 
01:06:46.430 --> 01:06:46.440 align:start position:0%
do that just so we have contact
 
01:06:48.430 --> 01:06:48.440 align:start position:0%
information I I think we want to know
 
01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:50.599 align:start position:0%
how to get hold of you so so if you
 
01:06:53.109 --> 01:06:53.119 align:start position:0%
could give us your contact information
 
01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:55.960 align:start position:0%
happy too all right all right but but
 
01:06:58.390 --> 01:06:58.400 align:start position:0%
technically we don't use pink cards for
 
01:07:00.109 --> 01:07:00.119 align:start position:0%
our work sessions do we you don't need
 
01:07:02.430 --> 01:07:02.440 align:start position:0%
them for work sessions
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
no I I think the biggest thing that I
 
01:07:07.430 --> 01:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
just want to say is that if both of
 
01:07:11.510 --> 01:07:11.520 align:start position:0%
these pass uh which one do you get more
 
01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:13.240 align:start position:0%
bang for your
 
01:07:15.549 --> 01:07:15.559 align:start position:0%
buck right they cost the same amount of
 
01:07:18.029 --> 01:07:18.039 align:start position:0%
money one helps a tiny group and the
 
01:07:19.390 --> 01:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
other helps
 
01:07:22.029 --> 01:07:22.039 align:start position:0%
everyone including the family court
 
01:07:24.510 --> 01:07:24.520 align:start position:0%
which is already 95
 
01:07:28.069 --> 01:07:28.079 align:start position:0%
95 helps everyone the the family courts
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
already having trouble families are
 
01:07:34.029 --> 01:07:34.039 align:start position:0%
already getting uh different rulings
 
01:07:36.069 --> 01:07:36.079 align:start position:0%
based on whichever judge you
 
01:07:40.470 --> 01:07:40.480 align:start position:0%
get this doesn't help 95 will will solve
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
that represent question of the
 
01:07:48.069 --> 01:07:48.079 align:start position:0%
chair so This falls in division three
 
01:07:50.510 --> 01:07:50.520 align:start position:0%
because it's in the domain of families
 
01:07:52.589 --> 01:07:52.599 align:start position:0%
and Healthcare and right kind of our
 
01:07:54.750 --> 01:07:54.760 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction but there's a large element
 
01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
of this that division one was
 
01:08:01.549 --> 01:08:01.559 align:start position:0%
considering relative to judges and that
 
01:08:03.190 --> 01:08:03.200 align:start position:0%
I do have a question and I'm not sure
 
01:08:05.630 --> 01:08:05.640 align:start position:0%
who the right person to ask this of
 
01:08:08.190 --> 01:08:08.200 align:start position:0%
whether it's our other division or
 
01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:09.720 align:start position:0%
whether it's someone from the judicial
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
branch does either one of these have a
 
01:08:15.390 --> 01:08:15.400 align:start position:0%
lower impact meaning less need for more
 
01:08:17.550 --> 01:08:17.560 align:start position:0%
judges my current understanding is we
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
are 177 judges short in New Hampshire as
 
01:08:20.159 --> 01:08:21.709 align:start position:0%
are 177 judges short in New Hampshire as
of

01:08:21.709 --> 01:08:21.719 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:08:24.590 --> 01:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
now so you're going to have to refresh
 
01:08:28.070 --> 01:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
my memory because I I I don't think
 
01:08:30.189 --> 01:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
there the fiscal note on these three
 
01:08:33.070 --> 01:08:33.080 align:start position:0%
bills actually put a dollar next to the
 
01:08:35.149 --> 01:08:35.159 align:start position:0%
impact on the Judiciary I don't think it
 
01:08:38.229 --> 01:08:38.239 align:start position:0%
does but I do think there is an element
 
01:08:40.430 --> 01:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
of how we change
 
01:08:43.510 --> 01:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
policy relative to the impact on the
 
01:08:45.829 --> 01:08:45.839 align:start position:0%
amount of time in the courtroom and
 
01:08:47.910 --> 01:08:47.920 align:start position:0%
because of that and knowing that we have
 
01:08:51.630 --> 01:08:51.640 align:start position:0%
this gaping hole of number of Judges if
 
01:08:54.030 --> 01:08:54.040 align:start position:0%
one of those actually reduces is the
 
01:08:55.709 --> 01:08:55.719 align:start position:0%
workload that's advantageous to the
 
01:08:57.269 --> 01:08:57.279 align:start position:0%
state and that's the question I'm trying
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
to get
 
01:09:00.990 --> 01:09:01.000 align:start position:0%
to okay so I can wrap my head around
 
01:09:07.470 --> 01:09:07.480 align:start position:0%
that one uh be just between 64 and um
 
01:09:12.149 --> 01:09:12.159 align:start position:0%
95 which one feels to you representative
 
01:09:15.309 --> 01:09:15.319 align:start position:0%
katab as having
 
01:09:18.950 --> 01:09:18.960 align:start position:0%
um a a benefit to the workload
 
01:09:22.870 --> 01:09:22.880 align:start position:0%
management of the Judiciary do they are
 
01:09:25.149 --> 01:09:25.159 align:start position:0%
they both equivalent on on judicial
 
01:09:27.550 --> 01:09:27.560 align:start position:0%
workload or or
 
01:09:29.950 --> 01:09:29.960 align:start position:0%
different thank you for the question so
 
01:09:31.110 --> 01:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that there would
 
01:09:33.229 --> 01:09:33.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily be much of a Judicial impact
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
although I will say
 
01:09:39.309 --> 01:09:39.319 align:start position:0%
that the mediators did feel like 1564
 
01:09:40.829 --> 01:09:40.839 align:start position:0%
would help some more parents to be able
 
01:09:42.870 --> 01:09:42.880 align:start position:0%
to come to agreement that are currently
 
01:09:44.470 --> 01:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
in conflict and keep them out of going
 
01:09:46.590 --> 01:09:46.600 align:start position:0%
to court so about 80% of the parties
 
01:09:48.709 --> 01:09:48.719 align:start position:0%
tend to settle outside of court and 20%
 
01:09:48.719 --> 01:09:49.590 align:start position:0%
tend to settle outside of court and 20%
of

01:09:49.590 --> 01:09:49.600 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:09:52.189 --> 01:09:52.199 align:start position:0%
them are more higher conflict and need
 
01:09:54.430 --> 01:09:54.440 align:start position:0%
to get decided in court so they felt
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
like they'd be able to get some more
 
01:09:57.669 --> 01:09:57.679 align:start position:0%
parties to actually agree they were
 
01:09:59.910 --> 01:09:59.920 align:start position:0%
concerned with adding the element of
 
01:10:01.870 --> 01:10:01.880 align:start position:0%
arguing over the number of days with
 
01:10:04.310 --> 01:10:04.320 align:start position:0%
each party with 1595 that it was going
 
01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:06.920 align:start position:0%
to create more
 
01:10:09.310 --> 01:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
conflict in representative Bickford it
 
01:10:11.070 --> 01:10:11.080 align:start position:0%
looks like you have a different opinion
 
01:10:13.750 --> 01:10:13.760 align:start position:0%
yes I do in fact if when I had read
 
01:10:13.760 --> 01:10:15.709 align:start position:0%
yes I do in fact if when I had read
the

01:10:15.709 --> 01:10:15.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:18.790 --> 01:10:18.800 align:start position:0%
$114,000 thing it says it will be less
 
01:10:22.310 --> 01:10:22.320 align:start position:0%
conflict in there and uh you just go to
 
01:10:24.030 --> 01:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
the table they'll have a table and
 
01:10:25.790 --> 01:10:25.800 align:start position:0%
they'll have a a graph there and that
 
01:10:27.669 --> 01:10:27.679 align:start position:0%
says well this much time this kind of
 
01:10:29.510 --> 01:10:29.520 align:start position:0%
income and bang There It
 
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
Is and she she probably knows more about
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
it than I do I I I I think I want to
 
01:10:37.229 --> 01:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
start wrapping this up are are there
 
01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
other questions uh from the legislators
 
01:10:41.630 --> 01:10:41.640 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:10:45.590 --> 01:10:45.600 align:start position:0%
panel any last words of wisdom from
 
01:10:47.870 --> 01:10:47.880 align:start position:0%
people who come
 
01:10:51.790 --> 01:10:51.800 align:start position:0%
forward all right so
 
01:10:54.630 --> 01:10:54.640 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to go ahead and recess
 
01:10:57.709 --> 01:10:57.719 align:start position:0%
these three bills and representative
 
01:10:57.719 --> 01:10:59.709 align:start position:0%
these three bills and representative
walner

01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
walner
 
01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:02.320 align:start position:0%
uh I want to be able to talk to you
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
during the course of the afternoon about
 
01:11:06.790 --> 01:11:06.800 align:start position:0%
whether or not we could you think we
 
01:11:09.030 --> 01:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
ready to exec any of
 
01:11:13.030 --> 01:11:13.040 align:start position:0%
these okay all right well thank you very
 
01:11:16.990 --> 01:11:17.000 align:start position:0%
much uh that that closes uh those three
 
01:11:20.310 --> 01:11:20.320 align:start position:0%
bills uh I would like to and those three
 
01:11:24.070 --> 01:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
bills are 1282 1564 15
 
01:11:28.189 --> 01:11:28.199 align:start position:0%
1995 I want to open uh
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
1669 oh representative Lehman you're
 
01:11:35.470 --> 01:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
here now I didn't see you come in um
 
01:11:38.310 --> 01:11:38.320 align:start position:0%
okay because you're here um I'm going to
 
01:11:42.149 --> 01:11:42.159 align:start position:0%
go ahead and open uh
 
01:11:45.470 --> 01:11:45.480 align:start position:0%
1573 now the reason we're going to 1573
 
01:11:48.990 --> 01:11:49.000 align:start position:0%
next is because uh the fiscal node has a
 
01:11:51.590 --> 01:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
fairly dramatic impact on the judicial
 
01:11:54.390 --> 01:11:54.400 align:start position:0%
branch and division one handles the
 
01:11:57.709 --> 01:11:57.719 align:start position:0%
Judiciary so I wanted to uh make sure
 
01:11:59.830 --> 01:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
that um their point of view is
 
01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:01.960 align:start position:0%
integrated in in in what we know and
 
01:12:02.910 --> 01:12:02.920 align:start position:0%
what we
 
01:12:02.920 --> 01:12:05.110 align:start position:0%
what we
think

01:12:05.110 --> 01:12:05.120 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:24.470 --> 01:12:24.480 align:start position:0%
1573 Okay so
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
1573 did we did we have the Pearson
 
01:12:30.669 --> 01:12:30.679 align:start position:0%
Amendment before us last week
 
01:12:33.030 --> 01:12:33.040 align:start position:0%
0980 we did we
 
01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:34.669 align:start position:0%
0980 we did we
did

01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
did
 
01:12:38.910 --> 01:12:38.920 align:start position:0%
okay certainly a lot of room I go go
 
01:12:41.070 --> 01:12:41.080 align:start position:0%
ahead thank you Mr chair yes that
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
amendment was introduced and discussed
 
01:12:46.310 --> 01:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
last week though I feel uh there's a lot
 
01:12:49.350 --> 01:12:49.360 align:start position:0%
of room for further discussion on that
 
01:12:52.030 --> 01:12:52.040 align:start position:0%
as it wasn't entirely described or
 
01:12:54.110 --> 01:12:54.120 align:start position:0%
really uh combed through as adequately
 
01:12:57.149 --> 01:12:57.159 align:start position:0%
as I think it could have
 
01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:01.080 align:start position:0%
been all right uh oh go ahead
 
01:13:03.830 --> 01:13:03.840 align:start position:0%
representer walner well I I just wanted
 
01:13:05.350 --> 01:13:05.360 align:start position:0%
to remind you that this is the one we
 
01:13:08.070 --> 01:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
have the subcommittee on right and I
 
01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:09.760 align:start position:0%
think um
 
01:13:11.830 --> 01:13:11.840 align:start position:0%
I've called the subcommittee for
 
01:13:14.470 --> 01:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
Wednesday morning at 10: I've reached
 
01:13:17.430 --> 01:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
out to both the department and to the
 
01:13:20.149 --> 01:13:20.159 align:start position:0%
child Advocates office but also today we
 
01:13:23.910 --> 01:13:23.920 align:start position:0%
also contacted um the judicial
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
Branch about um having a representative
 
01:13:29.590 --> 01:13:29.600 align:start position:0%
there on Wednesday to talk about the uh
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal note that that's in the bill for
 
01:13:35.990 --> 01:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch okay so uh thank
 
01:13:37.750 --> 01:13:37.760 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for the trigger
 
01:13:40.910 --> 01:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
there I I I do want to say for the for
 
01:13:44.590 --> 01:13:44.600 align:start position:0%
the public and those that are here that
 
01:13:49.229 --> 01:13:49.239 align:start position:0%
1573 um represents uh the legislator's
 
01:13:52.709 --> 01:13:52.719 align:start position:0%
attempt to resolve a fairly significant
 
01:13:56.270 --> 01:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
problem that we had without placing uh
 
01:13:58.990 --> 01:13:59.000 align:start position:0%
juveniles out of state because we didn't
 
01:14:01.870 --> 01:14:01.880 align:start position:0%
have the capacity for them and that um
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
it came in with a a pretty hefty initial
 
01:14:08.390 --> 01:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
cost estimate uh we've asked the
 
01:14:11.110 --> 01:14:11.120 align:start position:0%
department and and other stakeholders uh
 
01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:13.960 align:start position:0%
to include OCA to to go back to the
 
01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
drawing board to really
 
01:14:19.669 --> 01:14:19.679 align:start position:0%
prioritize uh where where we're getting
 
01:14:21.830 --> 01:14:21.840 align:start position:0%
value where we're confident that we're
 
01:14:24.030 --> 01:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
we're improving the system reducing the
 
01:14:26.910 --> 01:14:26.920 align:start position:0%
risk to our kids and and but and doing
 
01:14:29.110 --> 01:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
it in a more efficient and less
 
01:14:31.990 --> 01:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
expensive way because there's enough
 
01:14:35.709 --> 01:14:35.719 align:start position:0%
moving Parts here uh We've set up in the
 
01:14:39.030 --> 01:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
division a um subcommittee that
 
01:14:41.709 --> 01:14:41.719 align:start position:0%
representative walner has volunteered to
 
01:14:44.750 --> 01:14:44.760 align:start position:0%
head up of of three people uh
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
representative priest herself and myself
 
01:14:50.470 --> 01:14:50.480 align:start position:0%
she's been working with the Department
 
01:14:53.470 --> 01:14:53.480 align:start position:0%
the department has been working hard uh
 
01:14:55.910 --> 01:14:55.920 align:start position:0%
trying to go around all the stakeholders
 
01:14:59.110 --> 01:14:59.120 align:start position:0%
to figure out you know what do we really
 
01:15:03.550 --> 01:15:03.560 align:start position:0%
need to do and um and so representative
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
walner has us on track to have a
 
01:15:07.550 --> 01:15:07.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting on Wednesday
 
01:15:10.990 --> 01:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
morning and and we're going to see how
 
01:15:14.709 --> 01:15:14.719 align:start position:0%
much we've learned since last week and
 
01:15:17.629 --> 01:15:17.639 align:start position:0%
it it feels in the informal progress
 
01:15:19.950 --> 01:15:19.960 align:start position:0%
reports I've been getting from Ms Morris
 
01:15:22.270 --> 01:15:22.280 align:start position:0%
and you can come on and and take a seat
 
01:15:24.910 --> 01:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
because I want to ask you where we're at
 
01:15:26.510 --> 01:15:26.520 align:start position:0%
my my
 
01:15:30.149 --> 01:15:30.159 align:start position:0%
general perception is that the
 
01:15:33.470 --> 01:15:33.480 align:start position:0%
department has been working hard and
 
01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
successfully at coming up with some
 
01:15:40.110 --> 01:15:40.120 align:start position:0%
mutual accommodations of concerns at
 
01:15:44.189 --> 01:15:44.199 align:start position:0%
maybe a lower cost to the state so that
 
01:15:46.430 --> 01:15:46.440 align:start position:0%
that's my introduction for you you you
 
01:15:48.350 --> 01:15:48.360 align:start position:0%
you you can you can refute that right
 
01:15:49.550 --> 01:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
away if you
 
01:15:52.189 --> 01:15:52.199 align:start position:0%
want no um I would say that we've been
 
01:15:54.070 --> 01:15:54.080 align:start position:0%
working closely with the OA because we
 
01:15:55.750 --> 01:15:55.760 align:start position:0%
do agree with the general premise of the
 
01:15:59.430 --> 01:15:59.440 align:start position:0%
bill we agree with the the desire to
 
01:16:01.550 --> 01:16:01.560 align:start position:0%
increase our scope and in create a more
 
01:16:03.070 --> 01:16:03.080 align:start position:0%
robust program we just want to make sure
 
01:16:05.390 --> 01:16:05.400 align:start position:0%
we can do it efficiently and effectively
 
01:16:08.030 --> 01:16:08.040 align:start position:0%
uh within the financial constraints so
 
01:16:10.590 --> 01:16:10.600 align:start position:0%
for the record I do you have uh M
 
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
Morris's information okay go ahead oh
 
01:16:17.270 --> 01:16:17.280 align:start position:0%
sorry um so yes we are working with them
 
01:16:20.510 --> 01:16:20.520 align:start position:0%
we have shared with them any uh changes
 
01:16:22.629 --> 01:16:22.639 align:start position:0%
we would recommend and then we're going
 
01:16:24.510 --> 01:16:24.520 align:start position:0%
to try to work on some financials for
 
01:16:28.110 --> 01:16:28.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:31.270 --> 01:16:31.280 align:start position:0%
well so because you're you're changing
 
01:16:33.550 --> 01:16:33.560 align:start position:0%
the overall recommendation of what we do
 
01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:37.040 align:start position:0%
with this bill is it it is it's the case
 
01:16:39.590 --> 01:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
then that the fiscal note still needs to
 
01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
be updated to catch up with where you
 
01:16:44.390 --> 01:16:44.400 align:start position:0%
guys are aiming to be on Wednesday
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
correct okay so we don't have we don't
 
01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:49.480 align:start position:0%
have new fiscal or a new fiscal note
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
today for that we really should consider
 
01:16:54.070 --> 01:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
very hard Mr Ripley you want to say
 
01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:56.080 align:start position:0%
something you don't have a new fiscal
 
01:16:58.189 --> 01:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
note the only thing I have is a
 
01:17:00.070 --> 01:17:00.080 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet provided by the department
 
01:17:02.870 --> 01:17:02.880 align:start position:0%
but again not in response to the
 
01:17:04.750 --> 01:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
amendment discussed last week but rather
 
01:17:06.629 --> 01:17:06.639 align:start position:0%
in response to the bill as amended by
 
01:17:06.639 --> 01:17:07.470 align:start position:0%
in response to the bill as amended by
the

01:17:07.470 --> 01:17:07.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:17:11.030 --> 01:17:11.040 align:start position:0%
house all right so so to the panel I I
 
01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:13.920 align:start position:0%
would suggest uh or I'll tell you what
 
01:17:15.350 --> 01:17:15.360 align:start position:0%
I'm going to do and you can do what you
 
01:17:17.030 --> 01:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
want I'm I'm not really even going to
 
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
look at it because I want to wait until
 
01:17:23.910 --> 01:17:23.920 align:start position:0%
um you know the paint has kind of dried
 
01:17:27.950 --> 01:17:27.960 align:start position:0%
on the new look to the bill and and then
 
01:17:30.709 --> 01:17:30.719 align:start position:0%
consider the adequacy of that new
 
01:17:32.830 --> 01:17:32.840 align:start position:0%
proposal and then we can worry about the
 
01:17:37.590 --> 01:17:37.600 align:start position:0%
money after that so so so I think next
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
week a week from now we'll bring 1573
 
01:17:44.149 --> 01:17:44.159 align:start position:0%
back and and really be able to bring it
 
01:17:45.709 --> 01:17:45.719 align:start position:0%
back to the whole division three to
 
01:17:49.709 --> 01:17:49.719 align:start position:0%
figure out what we want to do so um do
 
01:17:53.030 --> 01:17:53.040 align:start position:0%
would you mind just giving us like the
 
01:17:55.830 --> 01:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
three or four major highlights of the
 
01:17:59.110 --> 01:17:59.120 align:start position:0%
trend that you're going from what
 
01:18:01.790 --> 01:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
1573 represented when it came to
 
01:18:04.510 --> 01:18:04.520 align:start position:0%
division three and we're we're it you
 
01:18:06.189 --> 01:18:06.199 align:start position:0%
think it may be trending I don't I don't
 
01:18:09.110 --> 01:18:09.120 align:start position:0%
want you get out on a branch though um I
 
01:18:10.750 --> 01:18:10.760 align:start position:0%
can tell you one major change will be
 
01:18:12.750 --> 01:18:12.760 align:start position:0%
the certification process the
 
01:18:15.669 --> 01:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
recommendation in 1573 as it passed the
 
01:18:18.590 --> 01:18:18.600 align:start position:0%
house was for visits per year we are
 
01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:21.480 align:start position:0%
saying uh we are recommending at least
 
01:18:24.350 --> 01:18:24.360 align:start position:0%
two and it will say at a minimum too one
 
01:18:25.629 --> 01:18:25.639 align:start position:0%
will be the
 
01:18:28.950 --> 01:18:28.960 align:start position:0%
annual timely you know scheduled appoint
 
01:18:31.110 --> 01:18:31.120 align:start position:0%
uh certification and then the second one
 
01:18:32.110 --> 01:18:32.120 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:18:35.629 --> 01:18:35.639 align:start position:0%
unannounced so a spot check okay and
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
then because we have division one here I
 
01:18:41.350 --> 01:18:41.360 align:start position:0%
I I I have to specifically ask have you
 
01:18:44.510 --> 01:18:44.520 align:start position:0%
um had anyone from the Judiciary take a
 
01:18:46.590 --> 01:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
look at the new proposal is there a new
 
01:18:48.110 --> 01:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
proposal for when they're supposed to
 
01:18:50.790 --> 01:18:50.800 align:start position:0%
get engaged is there any impact on the
 
01:18:52.910 --> 01:18:52.920 align:start position:0%
initial fiscal note that was dealing
 
01:18:55.070 --> 01:18:55.080 align:start position:0%
dealing with judicial I don't believe
 
01:18:57.030 --> 01:18:57.040 align:start position:0%
there are any major changes to that
 
01:18:59.270 --> 01:18:59.280 align:start position:0%
portion um that would remain the same
 
01:19:02.709 --> 01:19:02.719 align:start position:0%
but that is something I defer to the OCA
 
01:19:04.350 --> 01:19:04.360 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:19:08.350 --> 01:19:08.360 align:start position:0%
OCA come on up okay and you to that
 
01:19:10.510 --> 01:19:10.520 align:start position:0%
better than I can and and for those who
 
01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:14.360 align:start position:0%
are curious why I I point that
 
01:19:19.709 --> 01:19:19.719 align:start position:0%
out um on the fiscal note uh the fiscal
 
01:19:23.149 --> 01:19:23.159 align:start position:0%
note suggests that the judicial branch
 
01:19:27.189 --> 01:19:27.199 align:start position:0%
requires nine new positions and that's a
 
01:19:29.229 --> 01:19:29.239 align:start position:0%
bunch of new positions and I know over
 
01:19:32.430 --> 01:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
the past year or two or three uh
 
01:19:34.430 --> 01:19:34.440 align:start position:0%
division one's been funding a growth in
 
01:19:37.350 --> 01:19:37.360 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch and
 
01:19:40.990 --> 01:19:41.000 align:start position:0%
um representative leechman if if you'd
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
like it it would be perfectly great if
 
01:19:46.629 --> 01:19:46.639 align:start position:0%
you joined us at the at the table so
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:53.390 align:start position:0%
 
questions

01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:53.400 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:19:55.030 --> 01:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
well if you have no I'm just saying if
 
01:19:56.550 --> 01:19:56.560 align:start position:0%
you have questions I'd like you to be
 
01:19:59.550 --> 01:19:59.560 align:start position:0%
able to use a mic
 
01:20:02.910 --> 01:20:02.920 align:start position:0%
um all right so so would you introduce
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
yourself again and and and say something
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
that causes representative Lehman to
 
01:20:06.800 --> 01:20:08.030 align:start position:0%
that causes representative Lehman to
have

01:20:08.030 --> 01:20:08.040 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:20:10.790 --> 01:20:10.800 align:start position:0%
questions see what I can do uh attorney
 
01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
Lisa masio I am the associate child
 
01:20:15.470 --> 01:20:15.480 align:start position:0%
advocate for the State of New Hampshire
 
01:20:17.390 --> 01:20:17.400 align:start position:0%
um I think one point of clarification in
 
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
the new amendment that is coming is that
 
01:20:22.270 --> 01:20:22.280 align:start position:0%
prior amendment was not intended to be a
 
01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.270 align:start position:0%
prior amendment was not intended to be a
replace

01:20:23.270 --> 01:20:23.280 align:start position:0%
replace
 
01:20:25.950 --> 01:20:25.960 align:start position:0%
all Amendment it was just intended to
 
01:20:29.550 --> 01:20:29.560 align:start position:0%
make some some small tweaks um so
 
01:20:31.750 --> 01:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
essentially that section around the
 
01:20:33.270 --> 01:20:33.280 align:start position:0%
Judiciary would be the same as what was
 
01:20:34.430 --> 01:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
passed by the house at the end of
 
01:20:37.550 --> 01:20:37.560 align:start position:0%
February we have looped in Erin krian
 
01:20:42.669 --> 01:20:42.679 align:start position:0%
who is the um judicial legislative LS on
 
01:20:44.270 --> 01:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
I think the conversations we'd like to
 
01:20:45.950 --> 01:20:45.960 align:start position:0%
have with her and I I do hope that she
 
01:20:48.070 --> 01:20:48.080 align:start position:0%
is coming Wednesday morning is just
 
01:20:51.550 --> 01:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
around the data and the numbers of kids
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
that this
 
01:20:56.390 --> 01:20:56.400 align:start position:0%
um new Provisions around hearings would
 
01:20:58.510 --> 01:20:58.520 align:start position:0%
touch that it's a pretty small
 
01:20:59.990 --> 01:21:00.000 align:start position:0%
percentage of the total number of
 
01:21:02.430 --> 01:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
children in placement um so hopefully we
 
01:21:04.629 --> 01:21:04.639 align:start position:0%
would be able to have a more robust
 
01:21:06.910 --> 01:21:06.920 align:start position:0%
conversation about those costs when we
 
01:21:08.790 --> 01:21:08.800 align:start position:0%
talking very specific data number of
 
01:21:11.430 --> 01:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
kids where they are under which purview
 
01:21:14.870 --> 01:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
they're placed whether it's 169b C D or
 
01:21:16.310 --> 01:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
a voluntary placement which doesn't
 
01:21:19.070 --> 01:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.310 --> 01:21:22.320 align:start position:0%
court so this may be a little bit of a
 
01:21:25.390 --> 01:21:25.400 align:start position:0%
jump B question um I know the department
 
01:21:28.270 --> 01:21:28.280 align:start position:0%
has spent a lot of time rethinking how
 
01:21:32.070 --> 01:21:32.080 align:start position:0%
we can um make the the kind of the
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
clinical oversight role more efficient
 
01:21:38.950 --> 01:21:38.960 align:start position:0%
has any effort been done to take a look
 
01:21:42.070 --> 01:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
at streamlining or improving the
 
01:21:44.149 --> 01:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
obligations or the reducing the
 
01:21:47.709 --> 01:21:47.719 align:start position:0%
obligations on the J
 
01:21:49.830 --> 01:21:49.840 align:start position:0%
Judiciary and this could be kind of a
 
01:21:51.189 --> 01:21:51.199 align:start position:0%
yes or no
 
01:21:53.709 --> 01:21:53.719 align:start position:0%
first has there there been an effort to
 
01:21:56.709 --> 01:21:56.719 align:start position:0%
take a look at the judicial workload to
 
01:21:58.669 --> 01:21:58.679 align:start position:0%
see if there's a way to redo the
 
01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:03.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.149 --> 01:22:06.159 align:start position:0%
people not not between the two of us no
 
01:22:07.430 --> 01:22:07.440 align:start position:0%
but that's why we're hoping to Loop in
 
01:22:10.310 --> 01:22:10.320 align:start position:0%
Aaron krian to to have some of those
 
01:22:14.229 --> 01:22:14.239 align:start position:0%
conversations okay so so um
 
01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:16.400 align:start position:0%
representative Hall do you have comment
 
01:22:18.350 --> 01:22:18.360 align:start position:0%
I do thank
 
01:22:21.229 --> 01:22:21.239 align:start position:0%
you during the public hearing on this
 
01:22:23.110 --> 01:22:23.120 align:start position:0%
there was a discussion about changing
 
01:22:26.470 --> 01:22:26.480 align:start position:0%
the Paradigm from routinely forcing the
 
01:22:28.189 --> 01:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
judicial branch to
 
01:22:30.189 --> 01:22:30.199 align:start position:0%
review I don't remember whether it was
 
01:22:33.030 --> 01:22:33.040 align:start position:0%
every 30 or 60 I think I heard both days
 
01:22:36.270 --> 01:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
what was going on to a paradigm where it
 
01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:39.760 align:start position:0%
was a strategy of elevation If the child
 
01:22:42.669 --> 01:22:42.679 align:start position:0%
care the case worker or somebody else
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
triggered an event the judicial branch
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
had a certain time to respond was that
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
language even looked into since we last
 
01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:50.430 align:start position:0%
language even looked into since we last
were

01:22:50.430 --> 01:22:50.440 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:22:53.830 --> 01:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
here we certainly did discussed that I
 
01:22:57.790 --> 01:22:57.800 align:start position:0%
think the purpose of this bill overall
 
01:23:00.189 --> 01:23:00.199 align:start position:0%
as well as the amendment is both
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
preventive in nature was also a response
 
01:23:04.910 --> 01:23:04.920 align:start position:0%
to the Judiciary kind of saying they
 
01:23:06.149 --> 01:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
felt they weren't getting enough
 
01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
information as well as long term at
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
least from the office of child advocate
 
01:23:14.550 --> 01:23:14.560 align:start position:0%
standpoint in line with director feser's
 
01:23:16.390 --> 01:23:16.400 align:start position:0%
uh goal to to get kids out of
 
01:23:18.310 --> 01:23:18.320 align:start position:0%
residential care so the purpose of the
 
01:23:20.390 --> 01:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
increased judicial oversight of that
 
01:23:23.550 --> 01:23:23.560 align:start position:0%
small subset of children was really to
 
01:23:25.550 --> 01:23:25.560 align:start position:0%
help move them more quickly out of
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
Residential Care both helping the child
 
01:23:30.550 --> 01:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
and reducing the cost to the state for
 
01:23:32.990 --> 01:23:33.000 align:start position:0%
paying for that so it didn't really
 
01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:34.719 align:start position:0%
align with an idea of just waiting till
 
01:23:36.750 --> 01:23:36.760 align:start position:0%
there's a problem and elevating it
 
01:23:37.950 --> 01:23:37.960 align:start position:0%
because the idea is to get the kid out
 
01:23:40.030 --> 01:23:40.040 align:start position:0%
of Residential Care More
 
01:23:44.550 --> 01:23:44.560 align:start position:0%
swiftly followup so I understand that
 
01:23:47.750 --> 01:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
and I I can see why triggering the judge
 
01:23:49.830 --> 01:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
and getting the judicial branch to
 
01:23:52.709 --> 01:23:52.719 align:start position:0%
review this but by no means are they
 
01:23:56.149 --> 01:23:56.159 align:start position:0%
going to be experts in the world of of
 
01:23:58.709 --> 01:23:58.719 align:start position:0%
child care of treatment right this this
 
01:24:02.030 --> 01:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
this that expertise is in the office of
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
child advocate is in DCF right is the
 
01:24:06.870 --> 01:24:06.880 align:start position:0%
case workers are going to have far more
 
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
expertise about this than the judicial
 
01:24:10.709 --> 01:24:10.719 align:start position:0%
branch so having the independent review
 
01:24:12.310 --> 01:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch I don't know that
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
gets that gets us to that solution I do
 
01:24:18.189 --> 01:24:18.199 align:start position:0%
think that if there is a problem and we
 
01:24:20.510 --> 01:24:20.520 align:start position:0%
need to make we need a court order to
 
01:24:22.590 --> 01:24:22.600 align:start position:0%
address that quickly that that that
 
01:24:26.750 --> 01:24:26.760 align:start position:0%
trigger mechanism has real value if if I
 
01:24:28.950 --> 01:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
believe we heard testimony about someone
 
01:24:30.510 --> 01:24:30.520 align:start position:0%
being restrained
 
01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:33.120 align:start position:0%
inappropriately if that's going on
 
01:24:36.149 --> 01:24:36.159 align:start position:0%
having a means to elevate that quickly
 
01:24:38.590 --> 01:24:38.600 align:start position:0%
even through some sort of expar court
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
order system service would be beneficial
 
01:24:43.590 --> 01:24:43.600 align:start position:0%
and I don't know that the amendment
 
01:24:46.510 --> 01:24:46.520 align:start position:0%
that's been proposed addresses
 
01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:49.159 align:start position:0%
that I appreciate the question this
 
01:24:52.910 --> 01:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
amendment does not address that um that
 
01:24:55.189 --> 01:24:55.199 align:start position:0%
mechanism already exists um I've
 
01:24:57.030 --> 01:24:57.040 align:start position:0%
practiced both as a parent attorney and
 
01:24:59.390 --> 01:24:59.400 align:start position:0%
as a dcyf attorney in the system a
 
01:25:01.750 --> 01:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
motion can be filed at any time by any
 
01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:04.679 align:start position:0%
of the parties in order to get judicial
 
01:25:07.149 --> 01:25:07.159 align:start position:0%
oversight if there is an urgent issue I
 
01:25:09.430 --> 01:25:09.440 align:start position:0%
think some of the question you're asking
 
01:25:12.270 --> 01:25:12.280 align:start position:0%
is actually addressed in HB 585 which
 
01:25:14.189 --> 01:25:14.199 align:start position:0%
was a retain bill that the house passed
 
01:25:17.430 --> 01:25:17.440 align:start position:0%
in January and is reflected also in
 
01:25:21.149 --> 01:25:21.159 align:start position:0%
s463 which gives attorneys to children
 
01:25:23.709 --> 01:25:23.719 align:start position:0%
in residential placement which would be
 
01:25:26.189 --> 01:25:26.199 align:start position:0%
frankly the person who would file that
 
01:25:31.030 --> 01:25:31.040 align:start position:0%
escape Clause um urgent
 
01:25:33.189 --> 01:25:33.199 align:start position:0%
motion what were those two build numbers
 
01:25:37.910 --> 01:25:37.920 align:start position:0%
s SP 463 and HB 585 it was retained last
 
01:25:40.510 --> 01:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
session and was passed by the house on
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
January 3rd whenever you guys had that
 
01:25:50.030 --> 01:25:50.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
you question for you represent w W ER
 
01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
did did you mention to me that we had
 
01:25:57.950 --> 01:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
somebody here from the judicial branch
 
01:26:00.510 --> 01:26:00.520 align:start position:0%
that was going to talk today or or did I
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
make that up or did somebody else tell
 
01:26:05.709 --> 01:26:05.719 align:start position:0%
me well I think I said that we had
 
01:26:08.709 --> 01:26:08.719 align:start position:0%
reached out to someone from the judicial
 
01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:11.040 align:start position:0%
branch to join us on Wednesday now
 
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
whether that person I don't I don't know
 
01:26:17.270 --> 01:26:17.280 align:start position:0%
the person when I see them so if uh
 
01:26:20.790 --> 01:26:20.800 align:start position:0%
they're here they might be but we did
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
let them know that on Wednesday will be
 
01:26:24.430 --> 01:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
meeting and I'm hoping that she can be
 
01:26:27.510 --> 01:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
there at that point oh thanks for the
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
reminder okay so this this is what I had
 
01:26:33.229 --> 01:26:33.239 align:start position:0%
in my head and I'm I'm wondering if I
 
01:26:35.990 --> 01:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
need to re-evaluate this I what I was
 
01:26:38.390 --> 01:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
hoping we would be able to do Wednesday
 
01:26:41.950 --> 01:26:41.960 align:start position:0%
is to really understand what the the the
 
01:26:45.550 --> 01:26:45.560 align:start position:0%
final Amendment ought to look like to
 
01:26:48.669 --> 01:26:48.679 align:start position:0%
1573 go ahead and get that over to OS so
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
that we could consider it
 
01:26:54.910 --> 01:26:54.920 align:start position:0%
Monday I'm wondering if we've done
 
01:26:58.790 --> 01:26:58.800 align:start position:0%
enough um homework on looking at the
 
01:27:02.709 --> 01:27:02.719 align:start position:0%
judicial obligations to to include them
 
01:27:05.709 --> 01:27:05.719 align:start position:0%
in the one more Amendment or if we still
 
01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:08.199 align:start position:0%
have sort of a separate track that ought
 
01:27:09.709 --> 01:27:09.719 align:start position:0%
to be worked what what are your thoughts
 
01:27:09.719 --> 01:27:11.109 align:start position:0%
to be worked what what are your thoughts
on

01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:27:16.149 --> 01:27:16.159 align:start position:0%
that well neither today or the day that
 
01:27:17.709 --> 01:27:17.719 align:start position:0%
we had the public hearing on this do
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
have we heard from the Judiciary so I
 
01:27:22.870 --> 01:27:22.880 align:start position:0%
think I would want to wait hear from
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
them before I started making any sort of
 
01:27:30.430 --> 01:27:30.440 align:start position:0%
changes or modifying anything right so
 
01:27:33.390 --> 01:27:33.400 align:start position:0%
so so right now I'm just thinking about
 
01:27:36.870 --> 01:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
my timeline which was that we ought to
 
01:27:39.310 --> 01:27:39.320 align:start position:0%
be done with the homework Wednesday
 
01:27:41.550 --> 01:27:41.560 align:start position:0%
morning but we really haven't even
 
01:27:44.310 --> 01:27:44.320 align:start position:0%
opened the the can of worms yet on
 
01:27:47.030 --> 01:27:47.040 align:start position:0%
looking at a j on the Judiciary so I
 
01:27:50.310 --> 01:27:50.320 align:start position:0%
don't think it's reasonable Wednesday
 
01:27:53.990 --> 01:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
morning to have a potential uh
 
01:27:56.470 --> 01:27:56.480 align:start position:0%
re-engineering of the J judicial
 
01:28:00.270 --> 01:28:00.280 align:start position:0%
obligations and time for OS to write an
 
01:28:02.709 --> 01:28:02.719 align:start position:0%
amendment for Monday that's that's sort
 
01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
of where I'm at does that sound rational
 
01:28:07.390 --> 01:28:07.400 align:start position:0%
that my timeline is we need to readjust
 
01:28:09.470 --> 01:28:09.480 align:start position:0%
my timeline I think we probably need to
 
01:28:12.270 --> 01:28:12.280 align:start position:0%
readjust the timeline all
 
01:28:18.030 --> 01:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
right okay so um representative leechman
 
01:28:21.030 --> 01:28:21.040 align:start position:0%
uh would you like to I would like to
 
01:28:24.750 --> 01:28:24.760 align:start position:0%
invite member of division one to to come
 
01:28:26.950 --> 01:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
join representative wall walner
 
01:28:30.590 --> 01:28:30.600 align:start position:0%
subcommittee Wednesday morning because
 
01:28:33.669 --> 01:28:33.679 align:start position:0%
because we're we're very good at at at
 
01:28:36.109 --> 01:28:36.119 align:start position:0%
at working with DHHS to relook this
 
01:28:38.750 --> 01:28:38.760 align:start position:0%
stuff but you know if there's if there's
 
01:28:41.229 --> 01:28:41.239 align:start position:0%
something in here that division one
 
01:28:43.790 --> 01:28:43.800 align:start position:0%
needs reworking because of the financial
 
01:28:46.510 --> 01:28:46.520 align:start position:0%
impact then we I think we need to get
 
01:28:50.990 --> 01:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:55.950 align:start position:0%
 
us

01:28:55.950 --> 01:28:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:59.550 --> 01:28:59.560 align:start position:0%
all right so so for the folks at home uh
 
01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:01.960 align:start position:0%
division one chairman Peter Lehman said
 
01:29:04.350 --> 01:29:04.360 align:start position:0%
that uh they're busy Wednesday morning
 
01:29:05.350 --> 01:29:05.360 align:start position:0%
but they're going to try to have
 
01:29:08.430 --> 01:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
representation at the
 
01:29:12.629 --> 01:29:12.639 align:start position:0%
subcommittee um all right so thank you
 
01:29:15.109 --> 01:29:15.119 align:start position:0%
for what you guys are doing do do you
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
have any final words now that we've
 
01:29:19.910 --> 01:29:19.920 align:start position:0%
we've kicked over some rocks and we're
 
01:29:22.109 --> 01:29:22.119 align:start position:0%
going to we're going to work harder on
 
01:29:23.910 --> 01:29:23.920 align:start position:0%
on Wednesday morning try to come up with
 
01:29:27.990 --> 01:29:28.000 align:start position:0%
something and see see how far we can go

01:30:55.070 --> 01:30:55.080 align:start position:0%
language to OS as an amendment to 1669
 
01:30:56.669 --> 01:30:56.679 align:start position:0%
so I have no problem dealing with the
 
01:30:58.229 --> 01:30:58.239 align:start position:0%
other bills sooner I'll let you know
 
01:31:00.550 --> 01:31:00.560 align:start position:0%

sure okay thank you okay representative
 
01:31:07.750 --> 01:31:07.760 align:start position:0%
Stringham uh Alex uh Alex's uh Amendment
 
01:31:11.669 --> 01:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
uh was sent in uh along with a change
 
01:31:16.590 --> 01:31:16.600 align:start position:0%
recommended um by um Mr White and looks
 
01:31:20.109 --> 01:31:20.119 align:start position:0%
like that that one was was prepared so
 
01:31:22.550 --> 01:31:22.560 align:start position:0%
there is an amendment that could be
 
01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
reviewed for 1593 if you want to do that
 
01:31:26.669 --> 01:31:26.679 align:start position:0%
so so let's go ahead and do that I'm
 
01:31:45.109 --> 01:31:45.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:48.070 --> 01:31:48.080 align:start position:0%
1593 it it's relatively short Amendment
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
so I'm just going to uh let everyone
 
01:32:20.709 --> 01:32:20.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:24.510 --> 01:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
this this this is uh the shall therefore
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
be referred to as the stringam amendment
 
01:32:31.350 --> 01:32:31.360 align:start position:0%
1055 so representative stringman
 
01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:34.520 align:start position:0%
stringman Stringham would you please
 
01:32:37.149 --> 01:32:37.159 align:start position:0%
summarize uh what caused this amendment
 
01:32:39.430 --> 01:32:39.440 align:start position:0%
and what you think it does well I'd ask
 
01:32:41.790 --> 01:32:41.800 align:start position:0%
for some help with Alex I will say that
 
01:32:45.070 --> 01:32:45.080 align:start position:0%
one of the changes uh the last line of
 
01:32:48.390 --> 01:32:48.400 align:start position:0%
paragraph two says any any unexpended
 
01:32:51.030 --> 01:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
funds shall lapse to the general fund
 
01:32:55.070 --> 01:32:55.080 align:start position:0%
used to say July 1st 2025 and now says
 
01:32:56.790 --> 01:32:56.800 align:start position:0%
June 30th
 
01:33:00.950 --> 01:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
2025 uh Finance felt like if the monies
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
had to be held that would put it into
 
01:33:07.629 --> 01:33:07.639 align:start position:0%
the next bium and uh moving it up by one
 
01:33:10.590 --> 01:33:10.600 align:start position:0%
day uh that uh what a difference to day
 
01:33:12.430 --> 01:33:12.440 align:start position:0%
makes actually does make a difference
 
01:33:15.189 --> 01:33:15.199 align:start position:0%
there um in terms of the other wording
 
01:33:17.950 --> 01:33:17.960 align:start position:0%
uh changes I'd prefer to have Alex talk
 
01:33:21.830 --> 01:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
to U Mr kbis if if you could so we're
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
all struggling with your last name
 
01:33:28.629 --> 01:33:28.639 align:start position:0%
so kbis yeah so Mr kbis would you come
 
01:33:33.590 --> 01:33:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:36.270 --> 01:33:36.280 align:start position:0%
call good afternoon Alex kbis
 
01:33:38.350 --> 01:33:38.360 align:start position:0%
representing the area agencies yes
 
01:33:40.229 --> 01:33:40.239 align:start position:0%
there's three changes to this amendment
 
01:33:42.470 --> 01:33:42.480 align:start position:0%
uh representative Stringham there's
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
mentioned the first one which was the I
 
01:33:47.390 --> 01:33:47.400 align:start position:0%
believe online 9 which changes July 1st
 
01:33:51.870 --> 01:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
to June 30th it also on line six we
 
01:33:55.030 --> 01:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
changed it to in the in the bill as it
 
01:33:56.790 --> 01:33:56.800 align:start position:0%
came over from Health and Human Services
 
01:33:58.709 --> 01:33:58.719 align:start position:0%
it said the the fiscal year ending on
 
01:34:01.109 --> 01:34:01.119 align:start position:0%
line six it said for the fiscal year
 
01:34:04.229 --> 01:34:04.239 align:start position:0%
ending June 30th 2024 so we changed it
 
01:34:07.830 --> 01:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
to the bium ending June 30th
 
01:34:11.629 --> 01:34:11.639 align:start position:0%
2025 and then really the the big change
 
01:34:14.030 --> 01:34:14.040 align:start position:0%
is those were just technical issues that
 
01:34:16.149 --> 01:34:16.159 align:start position:0%
DHHS had pointed out and I think they're
 
01:34:19.870 --> 01:34:19.880 align:start position:0%
correct to get those updated which we've
 
01:34:21.990 --> 01:34:22.000 align:start position:0%
done the PO
 
01:34:23.709 --> 01:34:23.719 align:start position:0%
it it is kind of a policy change
 
01:34:25.709 --> 01:34:25.719 align:start position:0%
different from what had come over from
 
01:34:27.390 --> 01:34:27.400 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services but I think it
 
01:34:29.790 --> 01:34:29.800 align:start position:0%
addresses the Chairman's point about why
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
should children with disabilities be
 
01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:34.880 align:start position:0%
treated differently than you know other
 
01:34:37.550 --> 01:34:37.560 align:start position:0%
other individuals who have recreational
 
01:34:40.669 --> 01:34:40.679 align:start position:0%
needs and so this bill would only apply
 
01:34:42.270 --> 01:34:42.280 align:start position:0%
this amendment would make the program
 
01:34:47.070 --> 01:34:47.080 align:start position:0%
only apply to adults and the theory is
 
01:34:49.550 --> 01:34:49.560 align:start position:0%
that children with disabilities who are
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
in school have more opportuni unties
 
01:34:53.669 --> 01:34:53.679 align:start position:0%
because they're in they're in school or
 
01:34:56.189 --> 01:34:56.199 align:start position:0%
in special education they would have
 
01:34:57.830 --> 01:34:57.840 align:start position:0%
recreational more recreational
 
01:35:00.070 --> 01:35:00.080 align:start position:0%
opportunities than someone who was an
 
01:35:02.990 --> 01:35:03.000 align:start position:0%
adult so that that is the the big change
 
01:35:04.350 --> 01:35:04.360 align:start position:0%
here that this would only make the
 
01:35:06.430 --> 01:35:06.440 align:start position:0%
program applicable to adults who've
 
01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:09.880 align:start position:0%
either graduated or exited the school
 
01:35:12.910 --> 01:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
system thank you for that if if I could
 
01:35:17.550 --> 01:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
re rephrase what I I think I said uh I I
 
01:35:19.270 --> 01:35:19.280 align:start position:0%
I just wanted to make sure that what we
 
01:35:21.870 --> 01:35:21.880 align:start position:0%
were doing here we could take a look we
 
01:35:24.870 --> 01:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
could talk to uh New Hampshire taxpaying
 
01:35:26.669 --> 01:35:26.679 align:start position:0%
families that aren't receiving any
 
01:35:28.590 --> 01:35:28.600 align:start position:0%
benefits and be able to explain and
 
01:35:32.189 --> 01:35:32.199 align:start position:0%
articulate to them why this program was
 
01:35:34.990 --> 01:35:35.000 align:start position:0%
fair that it wasn't given that it wasn't
 
01:35:37.550 --> 01:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
helping their family directly and so I
 
01:35:39.990 --> 01:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
think this that's what motivated this is
 
01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
to try to answer the question for New
 
01:35:44.550 --> 01:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire taxpaying
 
01:35:47.629 --> 01:35:47.639 align:start position:0%
families why this population why is this
 
01:35:51.109 --> 01:35:51.119 align:start position:0%
fair and reasonable and is is that yes
 
01:35:52.990 --> 01:35:53.000 align:start position:0%
okay and I and I think the the the
 
01:35:55.109 --> 01:35:55.119 align:start position:0%
reason would be that as I tried to
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
explain last week that these are
 
01:35:59.070 --> 01:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
individuals who in many cases are just
 
01:36:00.669 --> 01:36:00.679 align:start position:0%
on Social Security maybe they have a
 
01:36:03.310 --> 01:36:03.320 align:start position:0%
very very part-time job and they don't
 
01:36:06.109 --> 01:36:06.119 align:start position:0%
have the income and their families
 
01:36:08.350 --> 01:36:08.360 align:start position:0%
have they're getting older you know
 
01:36:09.830 --> 01:36:09.840 align:start position:0%
they're they're in their 70s should
 
01:36:11.189 --> 01:36:11.199 align:start position:0%
should someone who has a parent in their
 
01:36:13.270 --> 01:36:13.280 align:start position:0%
70s be responsible for their adult
 
01:36:16.870 --> 01:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
child's you know recreational needs so
 
01:36:19.550 --> 01:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
that that the bill has has really been
 
01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
uh there's been a lot of compromises
 
01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:22.520 align:start position:0%
along the way originally it was a
 
01:36:24.350 --> 01:36:24.360 align:start position:0%
million doll appropriation it's been cut
 
01:36:26.430 --> 01:36:26.440 align:start position:0%
in half originally it was a continually
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
appropriated fund we were going to stand
 
01:36:31.070 --> 01:36:31.080 align:start position:0%
up rules now it's only basically a year
 
01:36:33.189 --> 01:36:33.199 align:start position:0%
and a half program that'll expire and
 
01:36:34.629 --> 01:36:34.639 align:start position:0%
we'll have to start over again in the
 
01:36:37.590 --> 01:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
next bium we put a cap of $600
 
01:36:39.950 --> 01:36:39.960 align:start position:0%
originally there was no cap in there and
 
01:36:41.709 --> 01:36:41.719 align:start position:0%
now we're making it applicable only to
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
adults who've left school so that we
 
01:36:46.470 --> 01:36:46.480 align:start position:0%
have U you know made a lot of
 
01:36:48.189 --> 01:36:48.199 align:start position:0%
accommodations you know understanding
 
01:36:49.870 --> 01:36:49.880 align:start position:0%
that this is obviously an unusual
 
01:36:51.910 --> 01:36:51.920 align:start position:0%
request in the off budget
 
01:36:56.470 --> 01:36:56.480 align:start position:0%
cycle so so because um this this
 
01:37:01.430 --> 01:37:01.440 align:start position:0%
amendment uh restricts it to adults only
 
01:37:04.030 --> 01:37:04.040 align:start position:0%
um what what's Your Gut tell you about
 
01:37:05.709 --> 01:37:05.719 align:start position:0%
what it does to that
 
01:37:09.109 --> 01:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
500,000 I'm not I'm not you might be
 
01:37:11.030 --> 01:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
able to reduce it a little bit I I if
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
you give me a little more time I could
 
01:37:15.109 --> 01:37:15.119 align:start position:0%
try to get some information on age how
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
about till next wed till next Monday not
 
01:37:20.830 --> 01:37:20.840 align:start position:0%
afternoon sure I will try to get some
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
information about utilization in the
 
01:37:25.470 --> 01:37:25.480 align:start position:0%
past based on age do does your instinct
 
01:37:27.270 --> 01:37:27.280 align:start position:0%
tell you that it'll be sign
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
significantly different than 500,000 I
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
depends what you mean by significant uh
 
01:37:37.950 --> 01:37:37.960 align:start position:0%
100,000 I I would say probably not more
 
01:37:40.709 --> 01:37:40.719 align:start position:0%
than 100,000 all right
 
01:37:45.870 --> 01:37:45.880 align:start position:0%
yeah okay um are there questions for go
 
01:37:47.589 --> 01:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
go ahead representative Leon um thank
 
01:37:49.629 --> 01:37:49.639 align:start position:0%

01:37:52.229 --> 01:37:52.239 align:start position:0%
being here with us um I I I like the way
 
01:37:53.669 --> 01:37:53.679 align:start position:0%
that this amendment is going thanks for
 
01:37:55.070 --> 01:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
cleaning up some of the language we had
 
01:37:58.589 --> 01:37:58.599 align:start position:0%
in HHS um when we're looking at this
 
01:38:01.750 --> 01:38:01.760 align:start position:0%
population are they primarily composed
 
01:38:03.589 --> 01:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
of people who are getting the Social
 
01:38:05.510 --> 01:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
Security and cont actually required to
 
01:38:07.350 --> 01:38:07.360 align:start position:0%
pay for most of their services with that
 
01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:08.189 align:start position:0%
pay for most of their services with that
Social

01:38:08.189 --> 01:38:08.199 align:start position:0%
Social
 
01:38:12.629 --> 01:38:12.639 align:start position:0%
Security yes so um exactly so if you're
 
01:38:14.310 --> 01:38:14.320 align:start position:0%
I I tried to give this example last week
 
01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
suppose that you're in a staffed
 
01:38:17.950 --> 01:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
residence you run by an area agency or a
 
01:38:20.109 --> 01:38:20.119 align:start position:0%
different vendor who who contracts with
 
01:38:23.669 --> 01:38:23.679 align:start position:0%
the state uh they they give I think all
 
01:38:26.149 --> 01:38:26.159 align:start position:0%
but $74 a month of their social security
 
01:38:28.390 --> 01:38:28.400 align:start position:0%
goes to room and board because Medicaid
 
01:38:31.310 --> 01:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
does not cover room and board so uh that
 
01:38:32.950 --> 01:38:32.960 align:start position:0%
that really goes to their food and their
 
01:38:35.910 --> 01:38:35.920 align:start position:0%
shelter their their social security and
 
01:38:38.109 --> 01:38:38.119 align:start position:0%
as I said some of them do try to work
 
01:38:40.030 --> 01:38:40.040 align:start position:0%
part-time jobs if they're able to but
 
01:38:42.510 --> 01:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
they uh and some of them obviously have
 
01:38:44.310 --> 01:38:44.320 align:start position:0%
families that that can help and and
 
01:38:45.589 --> 01:38:45.599 align:start position:0%
they're not going to be asking for this
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
this is really for those those
 
01:38:50.550 --> 01:38:50.560 align:start position:0%
situations where uh you they don't have
 
01:38:52.390 --> 01:38:52.400 align:start position:0%
those families that are able to to chip
 
01:38:54.350 --> 01:38:54.360 align:start position:0%
in for for some of these recreational
 
01:38:57.550 --> 01:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
Services uh and again the the families
 
01:38:59.870 --> 01:38:59.880 align:start position:0%
throughout their lives really you know
 
01:39:01.229 --> 01:39:01.239 align:start position:0%
have gone above and beyond because we
 
01:39:03.910 --> 01:39:03.920 align:start position:0%
know that this population requires a lot
 
01:39:05.589 --> 01:39:05.599 align:start position:0%
of family support and that's really kind
 
01:39:07.669 --> 01:39:07.679 align:start position:0%
of a backbone of the system you know but
 
01:39:11.550 --> 01:39:11.560 align:start position:0%
at some point U you know those families
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
have a limited ability as they as the
 
01:39:15.870 --> 01:39:15.880 align:start position:0%
caregivers age to be able to to help out
 
01:39:17.430 --> 01:39:17.440 align:start position:0%
and as I said if you're in your 30s your
 
01:39:19.229 --> 01:39:19.239 align:start position:0%
parents are in their 70s how much longer
 
01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
can they continue to contribute to pay
 
01:39:22.870 --> 01:39:22.880 align:start position:0%
for these things so that's what this is
 
01:39:24.870 --> 01:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
trying to get at um thank you and if I
 
01:39:27.390 --> 01:39:27.400 align:start position:0%
can do a followup um since this won't is
 
01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:29.239 align:start position:0%
isn't designed to continue into the next
 
01:39:31.830 --> 01:39:31.840 align:start position:0%
budget cycle would it be reasonable to
 
01:39:33.229 --> 01:39:33.239 align:start position:0%
ask to have information on the
 
01:39:34.830 --> 01:39:34.840 align:start position:0%
utilization whether they're people who
 
01:39:37.070 --> 01:39:37.080 align:start position:0%
are on social security or if they're in
 
01:39:39.070 --> 01:39:39.080 align:start position:0%
any other population so we can really
 
01:39:40.709 --> 01:39:40.719 align:start position:0%
understand what we're doing so we can
 
01:39:42.750 --> 01:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
make sure we craft this well um when we
 
01:39:45.229 --> 01:39:45.239 align:start position:0%
come back to this next year yes I mean
 
01:39:46.830 --> 01:39:46.840 align:start position:0%
again as the this is another point I
 
01:39:49.149 --> 01:39:49.159 align:start position:0%
didn't bring up originally I think the
 
01:39:50.750 --> 01:39:50.760 align:start position:0%
department was going to administer this
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
program and and they if you look at the
 
01:39:53.669 --> 01:39:53.679 align:start position:0%
original fiscal not they were going to
 
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
need a part-time staff person so this
 
01:39:58.109 --> 01:39:58.119 align:start position:0%
requires them to contract it out and and
 
01:39:59.470 --> 01:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
I would be happy to work on some
 
01:40:01.149 --> 01:40:01.159 align:start position:0%
language that would require that
 
01:40:03.669 --> 01:40:03.679 align:start position:0%
contractor to issue a report that the
 
01:40:05.950 --> 01:40:05.960 align:start position:0%
next legislature can review so we would
 
01:40:07.350 --> 01:40:07.360 align:start position:0%
have some really good data by by
 
01:40:09.990 --> 01:40:10.000 align:start position:0%
separating it out we're actually G to
 
01:40:11.350 --> 01:40:11.360 align:start position:0%
it's going to be a lot easier for me to
 
01:40:14.229 --> 01:40:14.239 align:start position:0%
get you answers on on utilization on age
 
01:40:16.070 --> 01:40:16.080 align:start position:0%
on what type of services because in the
 
01:40:17.750 --> 01:40:17.760 align:start position:0%
past as you heard this was all sort of
 
01:40:19.270 --> 01:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
buried into the budgets and we have to
 
01:40:21.709 --> 01:40:21.719 align:start position:0%
go in by hand that's why it's hard for
 
01:40:24.390 --> 01:40:24.400 align:start position:0%
us to get good data on this right now
 
01:40:31.709 --> 01:40:31.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
W good afternoon again members of the
 
01:40:35.030 --> 01:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
committee Nathan white Chief Financial
 
01:40:36.790 --> 01:40:36.800 align:start position:0%
Officer um I just want to point out a
 
01:40:38.709 --> 01:40:38.719 align:start position:0%
couple of technical timing issues on
 
01:40:41.470 --> 01:40:41.480 align:start position:0%
utilization if we go out to bid for this
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
we'll have to develop an RFP an RFA
 
01:40:46.109 --> 01:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
whatever it might be post it and then go
 
01:40:48.870 --> 01:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
through the contract Contracting process
 
01:40:51.070 --> 01:40:51.080 align:start position:0%
um so number one is we wouldn't have the
 
01:40:52.550 --> 01:40:52.560 align:start position:0%
utilization figures for the agency
 
01:40:54.910 --> 01:40:54.920 align:start position:0%
budget in August number two is by the
 
01:40:56.589 --> 01:40:56.599 align:start position:0%
time that contract goes livees
 
01:40:58.470 --> 01:40:58.480 align:start position:0%
potentially you know six months down the
 
01:41:01.470 --> 01:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
road and the legislative phase starts at
 
01:41:03.589 --> 01:41:03.599 align:start position:0%
the house phase you may only have about
 
01:41:05.390 --> 01:41:05.400 align:start position:0%
two months of utilization at that point
 
01:41:07.750 --> 01:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
in time so they probably won't be a lot
 
01:41:09.709 --> 01:41:09.719 align:start position:0%
of great information going into the
 
01:41:13.310 --> 01:41:13.320 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year 2627 budget for this
 
01:41:15.950 --> 01:41:15.960 align:start position:0%
purpose um thank you and thank you for
 
01:41:17.669 --> 01:41:17.679 align:start position:0%
that information is it possible just to
 
01:41:19.669 --> 01:41:19.679 align:start position:0%
Simply administer these through the area
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
agencies that are already provid proving
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
services for it for this
 
01:41:26.830 --> 01:41:26.840 align:start position:0%
population we would need to Soul Source
 
01:41:28.310 --> 01:41:28.320 align:start position:0%
those contracts and if there's
 
01:41:30.589 --> 01:41:30.599 align:start position:0%
legislative language that would help or
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
those amendments probably more so if
 
01:41:34.149 --> 01:41:34.159 align:start position:0%
there's legislative language that would
 
01:41:36.430 --> 01:41:36.440 align:start position:0%
help direct us to do that that's
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
certainly helpful that way we don't come
 
01:41:40.910 --> 01:41:40.920 align:start position:0%
to GNC and say this was our soul soul
 
01:41:42.350 --> 01:41:42.360 align:start position:0%
Source request based on our
 
01:41:44.390 --> 01:41:44.400 align:start position:0%
interpretation that legislature wants us
 
01:41:46.270 --> 01:41:46.280 align:start position:0%
to do but if it's in writing that's
 
01:41:47.790 --> 01:41:47.800 align:start position:0%
certainly a little
 
01:41:49.950 --> 01:41:49.960 align:start position:0%
easier would it be possible to get some
 
01:41:51.669 --> 01:41:51.679 align:start position:0%
sort of language like that I know I'm
 
01:41:53.629 --> 01:41:53.639 align:start position:0%
just a substitute here but that seems
 
01:41:57.430 --> 01:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
like would be help so much more thank
 
01:42:01.229 --> 01:42:01.239 align:start position:0%
you um so have you've seen this
 
01:42:04.030 --> 01:42:04.040 align:start position:0%
amendment the Stringham Amendment yes
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
okay do do you do you have um any issues
 
01:42:11.070 --> 01:42:11.080 align:start position:0%
with the new proposed dates on line six
 
01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:13.560 align:start position:0%
and line nine no no I I think the
 
01:42:16.709 --> 01:42:16.719 align:start position:0%
changes are um are consistent with with
 
01:42:18.350 --> 01:42:18.360 align:start position:0%
the way we typically appropriate funds
 
01:42:21.149 --> 01:42:21.159 align:start position:0%
so thank you appreciate it so so uh
 
01:42:23.350 --> 01:42:23.360 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham there's been
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
some conversation here about maybe an
 
01:42:28.510 --> 01:42:28.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to the amendment do you do you
 
01:42:30.310 --> 01:42:30.320 align:start position:0%
are you tracking it do you do you think
 
01:42:32.229 --> 01:42:32.239 align:start position:0%
you can work with people to give us one
 
01:42:35.030 --> 01:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
more shot at this for for Monday
 
01:42:38.030 --> 01:42:38.040 align:start position:0%
absolutely and um U Mr White if you
 
01:42:40.709 --> 01:42:40.719 align:start position:0%
could help with soul Source language
 
01:42:42.830 --> 01:42:42.840 align:start position:0%
that would accelerate and help you out
 
01:42:45.310 --> 01:42:45.320 align:start position:0%
uh once the bill is enacted I would
 
01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:47.390 align:start position:0%
uh once the bill is enacted I would
appreciate

01:42:47.390 --> 01:42:47.400 align:start position:0%
appreciate
 
01:42:52.270 --> 01:42:52.280 align:start position:0%
it are there other questions on on where
 
01:42:54.990 --> 01:42:55.000 align:start position:0%
are we
 
01:42:58.470 --> 01:42:58.480 align:start position:0%
1593 anyone any else you want to say the
 
01:43:00.390 --> 01:43:00.400 align:start position:0%
only thing I would say is you know hope
 
01:43:01.790 --> 01:43:01.800 align:start position:0%
my hope is that we'd be able to get
 
01:43:04.470 --> 01:43:04.480 align:start position:0%
under contract maybe in November and
 
01:43:06.830 --> 01:43:06.840 align:start position:0%
that might give us five to six months of
 
01:43:08.830 --> 01:43:08.840 align:start position:0%
data at least maybe towards the end of
 
01:43:11.390 --> 01:43:11.400 align:start position:0%
the house phase so it to the extent Soul
 
01:43:13.910 --> 01:43:13.920 align:start position:0%
sourcing would help speed things up but
 
01:43:15.390 --> 01:43:15.400 align:start position:0%
but that was my original thought when we
 
01:43:17.229 --> 01:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
were going to go to Contracting is maybe
 
01:43:19.270 --> 01:43:19.280 align:start position:0%
November 1st we could get this up and
 
01:43:21.189 --> 01:43:21.199 align:start position:0%
running so personally I hate Soul
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
sourcing I mean you really need to have
 
01:43:25.430 --> 01:43:25.440 align:start position:0%
a strong justification in my mind for a
 
01:43:28.550 --> 01:43:28.560 align:start position:0%
soul source and I I I I'm not sure that
 
01:43:32.350 --> 01:43:32.360 align:start position:0%
this meets a threshold for that um but
 
01:43:36.229 --> 01:43:36.239 align:start position:0%
maybe we could talk about that um um
 
01:43:40.350 --> 01:43:40.360 align:start position:0%
okay so thank you for your work on this
 
01:43:43.109 --> 01:43:43.119 align:start position:0%
and I know uh it's been a lot of changes
 
01:43:45.750 --> 01:43:45.760 align:start position:0%
and I appreciate you sticking with it so
 
01:43:47.750 --> 01:43:47.760 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you Mr
 
01:43:50.149 --> 01:43:50.159 align:start position:0%
W if there's nothing else I'm going to
 
01:43:50.159 --> 01:43:53.229 align:start position:0%
W if there's nothing else I'm going to
close

01:43:53.229 --> 01:43:53.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:57.430 --> 01:43:57.440 align:start position:0%
1593 all right that leaves us down to
 
01:44:01.550 --> 01:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
two I'm going to I'm going to ask uh
 
01:44:04.229 --> 01:44:04.239 align:start position:0%
well three actually because 1669 were
 
01:44:06.189 --> 01:44:06.199 align:start position:0%
waiting for the amendment to come across
 
01:44:09.310 --> 01:44:09.320 align:start position:0%
the line so I'm going to turn the gavl
 
01:44:12.189 --> 01:44:12.199 align:start position:0%
over to representative Mooney and she's
 
01:44:18.310 --> 01:44:18.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:20.830 --> 01:44:20.840 align:start position:0%
1598 thank you Mr chairman again good
 
01:44:23.109 --> 01:44:23.119 align:start position:0%

01:45:08.950 --> 01:45:08.960 align:start position:0%
Concept for New Hampshire to adopt lots
 
01:45:12.669 --> 01:45:12.679 align:start position:0%
of questions lots of details lots of
 
01:45:16.390 --> 01:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
information since we last met various
 
01:45:19.550 --> 01:45:19.560 align:start position:0%
and very specific questions were
 
01:45:22.470 --> 01:45:22.480 align:start position:0%
submitted to
 
01:45:25.830 --> 01:45:25.840 align:start position:0%
DHHS and I know that legal assistance
 
01:45:27.669 --> 01:45:27.679 align:start position:0%

rights has worked very heavily on uh
 
01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:33.960 align:start position:0%
some details that need to be ironed out
 
01:45:37.629 --> 01:45:37.639 align:start position:0%
related to this bill there's also an
 
01:45:40.950 --> 01:45:40.960 align:start position:0%
individual here who expertise is on
 
01:45:43.510 --> 01:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
Social Security and its benefits and
 
01:45:46.149 --> 01:45:46.159 align:start position:0%
would also like to weigh in and perhaps
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
take questions with regards to that
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
aspect of it is that individual here
 
01:45:51.199 --> 01:45:51.910 align:start position:0%
aspect of it is that individual here
thank

01:45:51.910 --> 01:45:51.920 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:45:56.109 --> 01:45:56.119 align:start position:0%
you okay to start we're benefited by the
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
fact that the prime sponsor is here with
 
01:46:01.669 --> 01:46:01.679 align:start position:0%
us and that is a huge plus when a
 
01:46:04.990 --> 01:46:05.000 align:start position:0%
division in finance is taking on a bill
 
01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:07.560 align:start position:0%
is to hear it from this Prime sponsor
 
01:46:10.550 --> 01:46:10.560 align:start position:0%
what it does what needs to be done and
 
01:46:12.550 --> 01:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
what the recommendation should be so
 
01:46:14.669 --> 01:46:14.679 align:start position:0%
with that I'm going to recognize
 
01:46:16.350 --> 01:46:16.360 align:start position:0%
representative walner for any comments
 
01:46:17.790 --> 01:46:17.800 align:start position:0%
you may want to make about your bill
 
01:46:19.390 --> 01:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
House Bill
 
01:46:19.400 --> 01:46:20.990 align:start position:0%
House Bill
1598

01:46:20.990 --> 01:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
1598
 
01:46:22.589 --> 01:46:22.599 align:start position:0%
well we did have a public hearing last
 
01:46:25.589 --> 01:46:25.599 align:start position:0%
week and I introduced the bill um I
 
01:46:28.550 --> 01:46:28.560 align:start position:0%
guess what I said last week was
 
01:46:31.270 --> 01:46:31.280 align:start position:0%
that several months ago I was surprised
 
01:46:34.990 --> 01:46:35.000 align:start position:0%
to learn that um in New Hampshire we
 
01:46:37.910 --> 01:46:37.920 align:start position:0%
actually when children go into um the
 
01:46:40.149 --> 01:46:40.159 align:start position:0%
care of the state either for foster care
 
01:46:42.870 --> 01:46:42.880 align:start position:0%
or residential care if they have a
 
01:46:42.880 --> 01:46:43.910 align:start position:0%
or residential care if they have a
Social

01:46:43.910 --> 01:46:43.920 align:start position:0%
Social
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
Security um benefit the state actually
 
01:46:52.350 --> 01:46:52.360 align:start position:0%
keeps that benefit while the child is in
 
01:46:56.030 --> 01:46:56.040 align:start position:0%
care um most of these children or all of
 
01:46:59.109 --> 01:46:59.119 align:start position:0%
these children um
 
01:47:03.229 --> 01:47:03.239 align:start position:0%
have very serious disabilities you do
 
01:47:05.910 --> 01:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
not get Social Security as a child
 
01:47:09.750 --> 01:47:09.760 align:start position:0%
unless you have serious serious
 
01:47:09.760 --> 01:47:11.510 align:start position:0%
unless you have serious serious
disabilities

01:47:11.510 --> 01:47:11.520 align:start position:0%
disabilities
 
01:47:14.790 --> 01:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
or their parent has
 
01:47:18.550 --> 01:47:18.560 align:start position:0%
died and so these are some of our really
 
01:47:20.870 --> 01:47:20.880 align:start position:0%
neediest children and now they find
 
01:47:24.790 --> 01:47:24.800 align:start position:0%
themselves in foster care or out taken
 
01:47:28.470 --> 01:47:28.480 align:start position:0%
from their families into a residential
 
01:47:33.750 --> 01:47:33.760 align:start position:0%
situation um so these are kids that
 
01:47:36.589 --> 01:47:36.599 align:start position:0%
really end up what it ends up basically
 
01:47:38.070 --> 01:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
happening is that they're actually
 
01:47:41.510 --> 01:47:41.520 align:start position:0%
paying for their own foster care and
 
01:47:44.709 --> 01:47:44.719 align:start position:0%
many states are moving towards changing
 
01:47:48.550 --> 01:47:48.560 align:start position:0%
this policy and New Hampshire actually
 
01:47:51.430 --> 01:47:51.440 align:start position:0%
several um years ago
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
had a policy where parents while CH
 
01:47:55.669 --> 01:47:55.679 align:start position:0%
while children were in foster care in
 
01:47:57.669 --> 01:47:57.679 align:start position:0%
the care of the state the parents were
 
01:48:02.910 --> 01:48:02.920 align:start position:0%
build for the care and few I think two
 
01:48:06.629 --> 01:48:06.639 align:start position:0%
or three years ago we changed that
 
01:48:11.629 --> 01:48:11.639 align:start position:0%
policy um so we no longer do um charge
 
01:48:15.030 --> 01:48:15.040 align:start position:0%
families while their children are in um
 
01:48:16.270 --> 01:48:16.280 align:start position:0%
out of home
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
placement and the only what I could see
 
01:48:21.950 --> 01:48:21.960 align:start position:0%
is the only group that's really left
 
01:48:24.430 --> 01:48:24.440 align:start position:0%
paying for their own care are the the
 
01:48:28.030 --> 01:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
children who have these disability um
 
01:48:32.310 --> 01:48:32.320 align:start position:0%
incomes and it is complicated I won't um
 
01:48:35.390 --> 01:48:35.400 align:start position:0%
gloss over that I've learned a lot about
 
01:48:38.990 --> 01:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
it from um a number of people and I
 
01:48:40.830 --> 01:48:40.840 align:start position:0%
think that what would really be helpful
 
01:48:43.229 --> 01:48:43.239 align:start position:0%
is if we had
 
01:48:46.270 --> 01:48:46.280 align:start position:0%
um the person from Social Security the
 
01:48:48.430 --> 01:48:48.440 align:start position:0%
person who really has expertise in
 
01:48:50.790 --> 01:48:50.800 align:start position:0%
Social Security help us understand some
 
01:48:53.149 --> 01:48:53.159 align:start position:0%
of this legal assistance has done a lot
 
01:48:56.270 --> 01:48:56.280 align:start position:0%
of work as has a disabilities rights um
 
01:48:58.870 --> 01:48:58.880 align:start position:0%
clinic so and they're all here I think
 
01:49:01.910 --> 01:49:01.920 align:start position:0%
and they have posed a series of
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
questions to the department um which
 
01:49:07.350 --> 01:49:07.360 align:start position:0%
we're hoping that the department can
 
01:49:10.629 --> 01:49:10.639 align:start position:0%
come up and answer today thank you thank
 
01:49:13.510 --> 01:49:13.520 align:start position:0%

01:49:16.310 --> 01:49:16.320 align:start position:0%

01:50:27.109 --> 01:50:27.119 align:start position:0%

Council for Department of Health and
 
01:52:12.400 --> 01:52:17.030 align:start position:0%
Council for Department of Health and
Human

01:52:17.030 --> 01:52:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:20.430 --> 01:52:20.440 align:start position:0%
Services and so going into question one
 
01:52:22.709 --> 01:52:22.719 align:start position:0%
uh the department collects title E
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
Benefits uh for approximately 25
 
01:52:28.109 --> 01:52:28.119 align:start position:0%
children in lie of SSI and that's
 
01:52:29.830 --> 01:52:29.840 align:start position:0%
because we re we can receive more
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
funding from that title 4E than if we
 
01:52:35.870 --> 01:52:35.880 align:start position:0%
collected the full SSI for those
 
01:52:37.510 --> 01:52:37.520 align:start position:0%
children so we're able to get more
 
01:52:43.910 --> 01:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
funding in that sense uh the department
 
01:52:47.790 --> 01:52:47.800 align:start position:0%
um it also claims fore funding for
 
01:52:49.510 --> 01:52:49.520 align:start position:0%
administrative costs that's allowed
 
01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:50.390 align:start position:0%
administrative costs that's allowed
under

01:52:50.390 --> 01:52:50.400 align:start position:0%
under
 
01:52:52.510 --> 01:52:52.520 align:start position:0%
the title and we believe there would
 
01:52:54.709 --> 01:52:54.719 align:start position:0%
likely be a reduction in administrative
 
01:52:57.109 --> 01:52:57.119 align:start position:0%
costs connected to a reduction in
 
01:53:02.229 --> 01:53:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:06.510 --> 01:53:06.520 align:start position:0%
funds okay approximately 25
 
01:53:08.790 --> 01:53:08.800 align:start position:0%
children that's correct again I I give
 
01:53:10.189 --> 01:53:10.199 align:start position:0%
the warning that we're we're dealing
 
01:53:11.990 --> 01:53:12.000 align:start position:0%
with a lot of in andout I think you
 
01:53:15.069 --> 01:53:15.079 align:start position:0%
heard say me say this last time meaning
 
01:53:18.669 --> 01:53:18.679 align:start position:0%
our we we welcome that right we want
 
01:53:22.350 --> 01:53:22.360 align:start position:0%
kids to come in and out um of our care
 
01:53:24.550 --> 01:53:24.560 align:start position:0%
and in different situations so when I
 
01:53:28.669 --> 01:53:28.679 align:start position:0%
say 25 that is not again a stagnant same
 
01:53:30.830 --> 01:53:30.840 align:start position:0%
25 children we're really trying to do
 
01:53:32.790 --> 01:53:32.800 align:start position:0%
our best to give you averages even
 
01:53:34.990 --> 01:53:35.000 align:start position:0%
though that's that's very difficult you
 
01:53:37.550 --> 01:53:37.560 align:start position:0%
know we could have an inflex next month
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
of children of an additional 20 children
 
01:53:41.750 --> 01:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
we don't know what's coming that's
 
01:53:44.350 --> 01:53:44.360 align:start position:0%
what's been very difficult uh for this
 
01:53:45.990 --> 01:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
process of answering these what seem to
 
01:53:47.910 --> 01:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
be simple questions is that it's very
 
01:53:51.149 --> 01:53:51.159 align:start position:0%
layered so it is 25 but again that's
 
01:53:52.669 --> 01:53:52.679 align:start position:0%
considering the in and out and that we
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
don't know what each day may
 
01:53:58.390 --> 01:53:58.400 align:start position:0%
bring thank you Miss Dylan anything to
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
add to
 
01:54:02.310 --> 01:54:02.320 align:start position:0%
that um I would just add that I don't
 
01:54:04.629 --> 01:54:04.639 align:start position:0%
think it is a fluctuating number she
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
said I can certainly understand kids
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
coming in and out but primarily um we
 
01:54:12.149 --> 01:54:12.159 align:start position:0%
still don't have a good sense of how
 
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
many of those children are actually
 
01:54:15.910 --> 01:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
receiving supplemental security income
 
01:54:17.950 --> 01:54:17.960 align:start position:0%
SSI which is a welfare or needs-based
 
01:54:20.229 --> 01:54:20.239 align:start position:0%
benefit under Social Security
 
01:54:22.510 --> 01:54:22.520 align:start position:0%
versus title 2 benefits which are
 
01:54:25.189 --> 01:54:25.199 align:start position:0%
dependent benefits so children qualify
 
01:54:29.189 --> 01:54:29.199 align:start position:0%
for title 2 benefits only if a qualified
 
01:54:31.550 --> 01:54:31.560 align:start position:0%
parent um qualifies for those benefits
 
01:54:33.350 --> 01:54:33.360 align:start position:0%
so they can receive them under the title
 
01:54:36.189 --> 01:54:36.199 align:start position:0%
to that means that a parent who is an
 
01:54:38.430 --> 01:54:38.440 align:start position:0%
insured worker who has qualified with
 
01:54:40.310 --> 01:54:40.320 align:start position:0%
their work earnings over time their
 
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
dependent child can qualify for a
 
01:54:43.990 --> 01:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
benefit under their record there may
 
01:54:46.270 --> 01:54:46.280 align:start position:0%
also be survivor benefits a deceased
 
01:54:48.390 --> 01:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
parent who is also an insured worker
 
01:54:49.790 --> 01:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
where the child could qualify for for
 
01:54:52.430 --> 01:54:52.440 align:start position:0%
survivor benefits those benefits are not
 
01:54:54.109 --> 01:54:54.119 align:start position:0%
subject to income and resource
 
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
requirements whatsoever title 2 only and
 
01:54:59.270 --> 01:54:59.280 align:start position:0%
therefore there are very fewer reporting
 
01:55:01.189 --> 01:55:01.199 align:start position:0%
and administrative requirements for
 
01:55:03.470 --> 01:55:03.480 align:start position:0%
those types of benefits you don't have
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%
to do an annual reporting for title 2
 
01:55:07.750 --> 01:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's no impact on income or resource
 
01:55:09.950 --> 01:55:09.960 align:start position:0%
limitations for those students I I'm
 
01:55:12.270 --> 01:55:12.280 align:start position:0%
sorry for those kids the only thing that
 
01:55:14.589 --> 01:55:14.599 align:start position:0%
would impact that if if somehow the
 
01:55:16.870 --> 01:55:16.880 align:start position:0%
parent became ineligible and suddenly
 
01:55:18.510 --> 01:55:18.520 align:start position:0%
the child wouldn't receive that benefit
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
anymore that would be the primary impact
 
01:55:24.470 --> 01:55:24.480 align:start position:0%
on whether a child receives title 2 or
 
01:55:26.430 --> 01:55:26.440 align:start position:0%
continues to be eligible for title 2
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
which is quite different from SSI where
 
01:55:30.910 --> 01:55:30.920 align:start position:0%
there are more parameters around
 
01:55:33.149 --> 01:55:33.159 align:start position:0%
reporting because it's a need-based
 
01:55:36.229 --> 01:55:36.239 align:start position:0%
program and just for clarity I know we
 
01:55:38.750 --> 01:55:38.760 align:start position:0%
both talk in title two and title 16 but
 
01:55:40.350 --> 01:55:40.360 align:start position:0%
just that's really if when you
 
01:55:43.270 --> 01:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
practicing Social Security Title two uh
 
01:55:46.990 --> 01:55:47.000 align:start position:0%
that is SSDI title 16 is SSI I just I
 
01:55:49.270 --> 01:55:49.280 align:start position:0%
know Megan we both speak that language
 
01:55:51.229 --> 01:55:51.239 align:start position:0%
and so when we say title two title 16
 
01:55:53.950 --> 01:55:53.960 align:start position:0%
we're talking about those just for um to
 
01:55:53.960 --> 01:55:55.550 align:start position:0%
we're talking about those just for um to
help

01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:55.560 align:start position:0%
help
 
01:55:58.109 --> 01:55:58.119 align:start position:0%
out very good and may remind you
 
01:55:59.870 --> 01:55:59.880 align:start position:0%
attorney young you said the word simple
 
01:56:02.030 --> 01:56:02.040 align:start position:0%
no one else no one no one here on this
 
01:56:05.470 --> 01:56:05.480 align:start position:0%
panel used that uh word so that's yours
 
01:56:07.550 --> 01:56:07.560 align:start position:0%
okay any questions from those on
 
01:56:10.149 --> 01:56:10.159 align:start position:0%
division three related to this
 
01:56:13.109 --> 01:56:13.119 align:start position:0%
topic okay M
 
01:56:17.950 --> 01:56:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:21.550 --> 01:56:21.560 align:start position:0%
please I um just for the record I'm
 
01:56:23.069 --> 01:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
Karen Rosenberg I'm the policy director
 
01:56:25.109 --> 01:56:25.119 align:start position:0%
at the disability rights Center um the
 
01:56:27.149 --> 01:56:27.159 align:start position:0%
question I would ask the department to
 
01:56:30.790 --> 01:56:30.800 align:start position:0%
pursue further is um this assertion that
 
01:56:34.030 --> 01:56:34.040 align:start position:0%
if the department doesn't take the 4E
 
01:56:35.950 --> 01:56:35.960 align:start position:0%
maintenance payments that they would
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
also lose administrative payments that's
 
01:56:40.910 --> 01:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
not I'm not an expert in that field I've
 
01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:43.239 align:start position:0%
been trying to get a handle on that
 
01:56:46.069 --> 01:56:46.079 align:start position:0%
information from other folks so it might
 
01:56:48.069 --> 01:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
just be something helpful for the
 
01:56:50.589 --> 01:56:50.599 align:start position:0%
Department to look further into maybe
 
01:56:54.189 --> 01:56:54.199 align:start position:0%
get some direct guidance from D us DHHS
 
01:56:57.709 --> 01:56:57.719 align:start position:0%
about that um that just is just a
 
01:56:57.719 --> 01:56:59.629 align:start position:0%
about that um that just is just a
question

01:56:59.629 --> 01:56:59.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:57:02.030 --> 01:57:02.040 align:start position:0%
really okay Miss Young are you amendable
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
to that certainly I can look into that
 
01:57:07.950 --> 01:57:07.960 align:start position:0%
and get and get back I don't think um
 
01:57:10.510 --> 01:57:10.520 align:start position:0%
just to be clear I was when I it was a
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
reduction not a complete Absolution we
 
01:57:16.470 --> 01:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
that was what we are thinking but we can
 
01:57:20.830 --> 01:57:20.840 align:start position:0%
come back and look at that thanks
 
01:57:22.790 --> 01:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
I would also just add one thing we're
 
01:57:25.430 --> 01:57:25.440 align:start position:0%
looking at the um total potential loss
 
01:57:29.390 --> 01:57:29.400 align:start position:0%
in SSI benefits um the maximum SSI
 
01:57:34.390 --> 01:57:34.400 align:start position:0%
payment in 2024 is 943 per month um the
 
01:57:36.310 --> 01:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
statistical data from Social Security
 
01:57:38.830 --> 01:57:38.840 align:start position:0%
from 2022 that was reported the annual
 
01:57:41.390 --> 01:57:41.400 align:start position:0%
report said that the average SSI payment
 
01:57:44.030 --> 01:57:44.040 align:start position:0%
to a child was 685 per month so the
 
01:57:46.270 --> 01:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
amount a child can get can vary
 
01:57:48.510 --> 01:57:48.520 align:start position:0%
depending on what other income resources
 
01:57:51.550 --> 01:57:51.560 align:start position:0%
or specific taxs pertain to that child
 
01:57:54.709 --> 01:57:54.719 align:start position:0%
so it's not clear also how many of those
 
01:57:56.629 --> 01:57:56.639 align:start position:0%
kids are receiving the maximum SSI
 
01:58:00.550 --> 01:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:02.669 --> 01:58:02.679 align:start position:0%
currently okay thank you anything
 
01:58:05.189 --> 01:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
further we're going to move to question
 
01:58:09.069 --> 01:58:09.079 align:start position:0%
two all right question two how many
 
01:58:12.470 --> 01:58:12.480 align:start position:0%
additional 4E eligible children are
 
01:58:14.669 --> 01:58:14.679 align:start position:0%
anticipated to be found eligible per
 
01:58:17.750 --> 01:58:17.760 align:start position:0%
year for SSI benefits and how did the
 
01:58:20.470 --> 01:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
department reach that calc
 
01:58:22.510 --> 01:58:22.520 align:start position:0%
ation Miss Young would you like to start
 
01:58:26.870 --> 01:58:26.880 align:start position:0%
on that uh sure we we um we had these
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
questions you know ahead of time and we
 
01:58:30.709 --> 01:58:30.719 align:start position:0%
tried to provide our best answers this
 
01:58:31.750 --> 01:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
was something we did not feel
 
01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.109 align:start position:0%
was something we did not feel
comfortable

01:58:33.109 --> 01:58:33.119 align:start position:0%
comfortable
 
01:58:35.950 --> 01:58:35.960 align:start position:0%
speculating uh about at this at this
 
01:58:37.709 --> 01:58:37.719 align:start position:0%
time we already provided the
 
01:58:41.069 --> 01:58:41.079 align:start position:0%
approximately 25 children right now but
 
01:58:43.910 --> 01:58:43.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of how many could be found
 
01:58:49.030 --> 01:58:49.040 align:start position:0%
eligible per year is we could not uh
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
spend speculate to that to give you an
 
01:58:55.270 --> 01:58:55.280 align:start position:0%
an accurate number uh we instead felt
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
that hiring a consultant to assist with
 
01:59:01.390 --> 01:59:01.400 align:start position:0%
this and other questions would be the
 
01:59:04.430 --> 01:59:04.440 align:start position:0%
best in providing any kind of guess uh
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
because that's what it would be right
 
01:59:07.629 --> 01:59:07.639 align:start position:0%
now is a guess and we want to be very
 
01:59:09.189 --> 01:59:09.199 align:start position:0%
careful about that when it comes to
 
01:59:11.709 --> 01:59:11.719 align:start position:0%
funding especially to just a
 
01:59:14.149 --> 01:59:14.159 align:start position:0%
guess thank you Miss Young Miss
 
01:59:16.910 --> 01:59:16.920 align:start position:0%
Dylan um yes I would just I would just
 
01:59:20.350 --> 01:59:20.360 align:start position:0%
say that um folks should be aware that
 
01:59:22.550 --> 01:59:22.560 align:start position:0%
uh in terms of CH I can't speak
 
01:59:24.430 --> 01:59:24.440 align:start position:0%
specifically to the 4E that's not my
 
01:59:27.790 --> 01:59:27.800 align:start position:0%
area of expertise but regarding SSI um
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
again according to the annual
 
01:59:31.510 --> 01:59:31.520 align:start position:0%
statistical report that was re released
 
01:59:33.629 --> 01:59:33.639 align:start position:0%
by social security for 2022 there were
 
01:59:33.639 --> 01:59:34.870 align:start position:0%
by social security for 2022 there were
approximately

01:59:34.870 --> 01:59:34.880 align:start position:0%
approximately
 
01:59:39.069 --> 01:59:39.079 align:start position:0%
1,67 kids under meaning folks under 18
 
01:59:42.830 --> 01:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
receiving SSI um in 2022 it's a very
 
01:59:45.830 --> 01:59:45.840 align:start position:0%
small number um there is very very
 
01:59:48.030 --> 01:59:48.040 align:start position:0%
strict medical criteria that a child
 
01:59:50.030 --> 01:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
must meet to qualif qualify for
 
01:59:52.030 --> 01:59:52.040 align:start position:0%
disability um under
 
01:59:54.750 --> 01:59:54.760 align:start position:0%
SSI primarily they have to have a severe
 
01:59:57.589 --> 01:59:57.599 align:start position:0%
impairment or combination of impairments
 
01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
is is expected to last or has lasted a
 
02:00:02.430 --> 02:00:02.440 align:start position:0%
period of 12 consecutive months um and
 
02:00:05.109 --> 02:00:05.119 align:start position:0%
they generally have to meet a marked or
 
02:00:07.709 --> 02:00:07.719 align:start position:0%
extreme listing um under multiple
 
02:00:09.750 --> 02:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
domains of functioning for children that
 
02:00:11.790 --> 02:00:11.800 align:start position:0%
means that they assess how they perform
 
02:00:13.870 --> 02:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
in school how they cannot perform in
 
02:00:16.310 --> 02:00:16.320 align:start position:0%
school how they do self-care things like
 
02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
feeding themselves dressing themselves
 
02:00:20.709 --> 02:00:20.719 align:start position:0%
capacity children have to be considered
 
02:00:23.109 --> 02:00:23.119 align:start position:0%
in two marked areas or one extreme to
 
02:00:26.830 --> 02:00:26.840 align:start position:0%
qualify for SSI so it's very difficult
 
02:00:28.790 --> 02:00:28.800 align:start position:0%
generally for children to qualify for
 
02:00:32.390 --> 02:00:32.400 align:start position:0%
SSI a diagnosis alone is not
 
02:00:34.830 --> 02:00:34.840 align:start position:0%
sufficient thank you representative
 
02:00:38.669 --> 02:00:38.679 align:start position:0%
walner followed by representative hle
 
02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry
 
02:00:42.229 --> 02:00:42.239 align:start position:0%
Lon representative
 
02:00:45.350 --> 02:00:45.360 align:start position:0%
walner thank you um would you give the
 
02:00:47.709 --> 02:00:47.719 align:start position:0%
number of children again this was
 
02:00:50.430 --> 02:00:50.440 align:start position:0%
according to 2022 the annual statistical
 
02:00:51.870 --> 02:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
report from Social Security
 
02:00:51.880 --> 02:00:53.830 align:start position:0%
report from Social Security
Administration

02:00:53.830 --> 02:00:53.840 align:start position:0%
Administration
 
02:00:56.790 --> 02:00:56.800 align:start position:0%
1,617 in New Hampshire under 18
 
02:00:59.550 --> 02:00:59.560 align:start position:0%
receiving SSI
 
02:01:02.790 --> 02:01:02.800 align:start position:0%
okay and I think just to be sure
 
02:01:04.870 --> 02:01:04.880 align:start position:0%
everyone understands the bill only
 
02:01:09.430 --> 02:01:09.440 align:start position:0%
addresses children who are in state care
 
02:01:11.430 --> 02:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
not so this doesn't not have anything to
 
02:01:14.830 --> 02:01:14.840 align:start position:0%
do with all the total not not
 
02:01:16.149 --> 02:01:16.159 align:start position:0%
considering children who are in
 
02:01:18.510 --> 02:01:18.520 align:start position:0%
placement or in care right so that's the
 
02:01:20.109 --> 02:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
number for kids just living with their
 
02:01:21.990 --> 02:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
parents who may qualify or in other
 
02:01:23.870 --> 02:01:23.880 align:start position:0%
familial situations that are not in
 
02:01:26.229 --> 02:01:26.239 align:start position:0%
placement so it just gives you a sense
 
02:01:28.669 --> 02:01:28.679 align:start position:0%
of how difficult it is for children to
 
02:01:30.950 --> 02:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
qualify and you know how many
 
02:01:32.390 --> 02:01:32.400 align:start position:0%
potentially out of the children that are
 
02:01:34.350 --> 02:01:34.360 align:start position:0%
filtering in and out of the system the
 
02:01:36.189 --> 02:01:36.199 align:start position:0%
chances of them qualifying meeting all
 
02:01:38.109 --> 02:01:38.119 align:start position:0%
of the parameters for this very strict
 
02:01:42.069 --> 02:01:42.079 align:start position:0%
medical total disability program are not
 
02:01:45.589 --> 02:01:45.599 align:start position:0%
high thank you representative Lon for a
 
02:01:47.470 --> 02:01:47.480 align:start position:0%
question um it was very similar it's
 
02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:50.280 align:start position:0%
answered thank you than you
 
02:01:50.280 --> 02:01:52.189 align:start position:0%
answered thank you than you
Miss

02:01:52.189 --> 02:01:52.199 align:start position:0%
Miss
 
02:01:54.550 --> 02:01:54.560 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I also want to point out that
 
02:01:56.229 --> 02:01:56.239 align:start position:0%
um my other my colleague from New
 
02:01:58.109 --> 02:01:58.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire legal systems is here um she
 
02:02:00.510 --> 02:02:00.520 align:start position:0%
may want to introduce herself good
 
02:02:02.910 --> 02:02:02.920 align:start position:0%
afternoon sorry good afternoon Michelle
 
02:02:04.069 --> 02:02:04.079 align:start position:0%
wangren from New Hampshire legal
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
assistant and I apologize I'm a few
 
02:02:05.480 --> 02:02:06.629 align:start position:0%
assistant and I apologize I'm a few
minutes

02:02:06.629 --> 02:02:06.639 align:start position:0%
minutes
 
02:02:09.790 --> 02:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
late did you get that name Mr clerk if
 
02:02:12.030 --> 02:02:12.040 align:start position:0%
you could for the record microphone
 
02:02:13.870 --> 02:02:13.880 align:start position:0%
close through your
 
02:02:17.750 --> 02:02:17.760 align:start position:0%
mouth here we go Michelle
 
02:02:22.870 --> 02:02:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:26.189 --> 02:02:26.199 align:start position:0%
n so and and just to put this number
 
02:02:28.229 --> 02:02:28.239 align:start position:0%
that U Megan was speaking about in
 
02:02:30.030 --> 02:02:30.040 align:start position:0%
further context like in New Hampshire
 
02:02:31.709 --> 02:02:31.719 align:start position:0%
right now there are something around
 
02:02:35.510 --> 02:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
30,000 children who qualify for special
 
02:02:38.149 --> 02:02:38.159 align:start position:0%
education so that just gives you an idea
 
02:02:41.790 --> 02:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
and we only have 1,600 children under
 
02:02:43.510 --> 02:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
and to qualify for special education you
 
02:02:46.950 --> 02:02:46.960 align:start position:0%
could be under 22 so now we have only
 
02:02:50.830 --> 02:02:50.840 align:start position:0%
1,600 children Statewide under 18 who
 
02:02:53.510 --> 02:02:53.520 align:start position:0%
qualify for SSI so it is a teeny tiny
 
02:02:55.030 --> 02:02:55.040 align:start position:0%
percentage of children that we're
 
02:02:55.040 --> 02:02:57.109 align:start position:0%
percentage of children that we're
talking

02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
talking
 
02:02:57.119 --> 02:02:58.629 align:start position:0%
talking
about

02:02:58.629 --> 02:02:58.639 align:start position:0%
about
 
02:03:00.750 --> 02:03:00.760 align:start position:0%
understood anyone further on this
 
02:03:00.760 --> 02:03:01.629 align:start position:0%
understood anyone further on this
question

02:03:01.629 --> 02:03:01.639 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:03:05.030 --> 02:03:05.040 align:start position:0%
two okay let's move to question three
 
02:03:07.030 --> 02:03:07.040 align:start position:0%
Miss Young oh I just I wanted to make
 
02:03:09.709 --> 02:03:09.719 align:start position:0%
sure given that the 30,000 in special
 
02:03:12.390 --> 02:03:12.400 align:start position:0%
education keep in mind just as as Megan
 
02:03:14.149 --> 02:03:14.159 align:start position:0%
pointed out this is a means-based
 
02:03:16.470 --> 02:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
program meaning SSI you have to meet
 
02:03:19.189 --> 02:03:19.199 align:start position:0%
certain income criteria so just I don't
 
02:03:21.270 --> 02:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
want you to take the 30,000 it is I
 
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree it is very difficult to
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
get on SSI but I just wanted to make
 
02:03:27.430 --> 02:03:27.440 align:start position:0%
sure that's clear as well it is a means
 
02:03:29.430 --> 02:03:29.440 align:start position:0%
programing you have to meet very strict
 
02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:33.830 align:start position:0%
programing you have to meet very strict
income

02:03:33.830 --> 02:03:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.310 --> 02:03:36.320 align:start position:0%
eligibility okay thank you for that
 
02:03:36.320 --> 02:03:37.589 align:start position:0%
eligibility okay thank you for that
question

02:03:37.589 --> 02:03:37.599 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:03:40.750 --> 02:03:40.760 align:start position:0%
three how did the department calculate
 
02:03:40.760 --> 02:03:42.709 align:start position:0%
three how did the department calculate
the

02:03:42.709 --> 02:03:42.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:03:42.719 --> 02:03:44.390 align:start position:0%
the
$74,000

02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
$74,000
 
02:03:49.549 --> 02:03:49.559 align:start position:0%
loss in 4E funds
 
02:03:50.709 --> 02:03:50.719 align:start position:0%
that was
 
02:03:54.310 --> 02:03:54.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned as I recall in the fiscal note
 
02:03:56.510 --> 02:03:56.520 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note is shocking for many
 
02:03:58.390 --> 02:03:58.400 align:start position:0%
reasons this is one so if we could have
 
02:03:59.629 --> 02:03:59.639 align:start position:0%
an answer to that that would be
 
02:04:01.709 --> 02:04:01.719 align:start position:0%
fantastic Mr
 
02:04:03.549 --> 02:04:03.559 align:start position:0%
White good afternoon members of the
 
02:04:05.189 --> 02:04:05.199 align:start position:0%
community white Chief finance officer
 
02:04:06.430 --> 02:04:06.440 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
 
02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:09.910 align:start position:0%
with the Department of Health and Human
Services

02:04:09.910 --> 02:04:09.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:12.069 --> 02:04:12.079 align:start position:0%
um the
 
02:04:15.790 --> 02:04:15.800 align:start position:0%
74,000 was one component of the total
 
02:04:18.229 --> 02:04:18.239 align:start position:0%
impact that we would expect um if this
 
02:04:22.270 --> 02:04:22.280 align:start position:0%
bill is to pass um there's currently
 
02:04:25.229 --> 02:04:25.239 align:start position:0%
25 again and I just want to caveat this
 
02:04:27.430 --> 02:04:27.440 align:start position:0%
figure as these numbers are constantly
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
moving every day um for roughly 25
 
02:04:34.350 --> 02:04:34.360 align:start position:0%
children um we would expect
 
02:04:36.790 --> 02:04:36.800 align:start position:0%
approximately about little over
 
02:04:39.990 --> 02:04:40.000 align:start position:0%
$700,000 impact because we're currently
 
02:04:43.229 --> 02:04:43.239 align:start position:0%
claiming 4E for them in the event we
 
02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
claimed SSI and you and as we do today
 
02:04:49.390 --> 02:04:49.400 align:start position:0%
where we do collect SSI
 
02:04:52.510 --> 02:04:52.520 align:start position:0%
we use the SSI towards the um payment
 
02:04:54.910 --> 02:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
for treatment and other services that
 
02:04:57.790 --> 02:04:57.800 align:start position:0%
those children would receive um so were
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
we to claim SSI for those children as
 
02:05:02.830 --> 02:05:02.840 align:start position:0%
intended by the bill we would no longer
 
02:05:06.669 --> 02:05:06.679 align:start position:0%
be able to claim that 700 and so odd
 
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
thousand um and we would still have a
 
02:05:12.149 --> 02:05:12.159 align:start position:0%
treatment need the the children would
 
02:05:14.870 --> 02:05:14.880 align:start position:0%
still need services and we would need to
 
02:05:17.669 --> 02:05:17.679 align:start position:0%
get General funds to pay for those
 
02:05:17.679 --> 02:05:24.310 align:start position:0%
get General funds to pay for those
services

02:05:24.310 --> 02:05:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
Miss Rosenberg oh I'm sorry no m
 
02:05:29.669 --> 02:05:29.679 align:start position:0%
Michelle Michelle wer from New Hampshire
 
02:05:31.350 --> 02:05:31.360 align:start position:0%
legal assistance again one thing I would
 
02:05:33.629 --> 02:05:33.639 align:start position:0%
say about that is so we're talking about
 
02:05:37.030 --> 02:05:37.040 align:start position:0%
25 children here um and what I don't see
 
02:05:39.629 --> 02:05:39.639 align:start position:0%
in the bill is a requirement that the
 
02:05:42.950 --> 02:05:42.960 align:start position:0%
department not claim for a funding and I
 
02:05:45.109 --> 02:05:45.119 align:start position:0%
know that I previously Circ circulated
 
02:05:46.270 --> 02:05:46.280 align:start position:0%
to at least some members of the
 
02:05:48.750 --> 02:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
committee um an article about how the
 
02:05:51.030 --> 02:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
intersection between um Social Security
 
02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
benefits SSI and 4E work and the way
 
02:05:56.990 --> 02:05:57.000 align:start position:0%
that my understanding is that it works
 
02:05:59.390 --> 02:05:59.400 align:start position:0%
um and if there is another 4E specialist
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
that knows something else that's I'd
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
love to hear that but in the documents
 
02:06:05.390 --> 02:06:05.400 align:start position:0%
that I've reviewed the way it works is
 
02:06:08.830 --> 02:06:08.840 align:start position:0%
that there's no bar on claiming both for
 
02:06:11.549 --> 02:06:11.559 align:start position:0%
benefits and Social Security if you do
 
02:06:14.390 --> 02:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
claim both however and a child receives
 
02:06:16.990 --> 02:06:17.000 align:start position:0%
fory funding their social security is
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
reduced dollar for dooll
 
02:06:22.430 --> 02:06:22.440 align:start position:0%
um so if the department were to receive
 
02:06:27.229 --> 02:06:27.239 align:start position:0%
say I don't know $4,000 per month in for
 
02:06:29.470 --> 02:06:29.480 align:start position:0%
refunding which may be you know probably
 
02:06:31.109 --> 02:06:31.119 align:start position:0%
in the ballpark of what they might
 
02:06:34.910 --> 02:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
receive um for a child in um an
 
02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:37.800 align:start position:0%
institution um their SSI would be
 
02:06:40.790 --> 02:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
reduced to zero so they would still have
 
02:06:43.750 --> 02:06:43.760 align:start position:0%
the SSI on file if they were to return
 
02:06:45.870 --> 02:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
home or to a less restrictive setting
 
02:06:47.870 --> 02:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
they may receive it but the department
 
02:06:49.589 --> 02:06:49.599 align:start position:0%
would still receive receive its fory
 
02:06:51.549 --> 02:06:51.559 align:start position:0%
money while that child is in
 
02:06:54.390 --> 02:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
institutional care and so if this you
 
02:06:55.669 --> 02:06:55.679 align:start position:0%
know if there needs to be a
 
02:06:58.030 --> 02:06:58.040 align:start position:0%
clarification that the department at
 
02:07:00.030 --> 02:07:00.040 align:start position:0%
least for children in institutional
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
settings where we know that the amount
 
02:07:04.950 --> 02:07:04.960 align:start position:0%
of $4 is going to be High um to to
 
02:07:06.910 --> 02:07:06.920 align:start position:0%
clarify that in those situations the
 
02:07:10.430 --> 02:07:10.440 align:start position:0%
department um may claim 40 funding
 
02:07:13.270 --> 02:07:13.280 align:start position:0%
simultaneously with SSI benefits I think
 
02:07:14.990 --> 02:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
that would be a nice clarification to
 
02:07:17.069 --> 02:07:17.079 align:start position:0%
make sure that the state is not losing
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
out on those $4 but again there is no
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
bar on claiming both and it's the amount
 
02:07:26.870 --> 02:07:26.880 align:start position:0%
of so um SSI that has reduced dollar for
 
02:07:29.390 --> 02:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
dollar not the amount of fory benefits
 
02:07:31.629 --> 02:07:31.639 align:start position:0%
now of course we know that these are
 
02:07:35.069 --> 02:07:35.079 align:start position:0%
children with extraordinary needs um and
 
02:07:36.790 --> 02:07:36.800 align:start position:0%
you know one might argue that being an
 
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
Institutional care um recognizes that
 
02:07:42.109 --> 02:07:42.119 align:start position:0%
that is an extraordinary need at the
 
02:07:43.549 --> 02:07:43.559 align:start position:0%
same time when you're talking about a
 
02:07:46.189 --> 02:07:46.199 align:start position:0%
child in foster home
 
02:07:48.830 --> 02:07:48.840 align:start position:0%
um those extraordinary needs are still
 
02:07:50.750 --> 02:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
present and so when we're talking about
 
02:07:52.629 --> 02:07:52.639 align:start position:0%
kids in foster homes where the amount of
 
02:07:55.149 --> 02:07:55.159 align:start position:0%
$40 claimed by the state is going to be
 
02:07:58.430 --> 02:07:58.440 align:start position:0%
less we would honestly like to see um
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
those children receive their their uh
 
02:08:04.189 --> 02:08:04.199 align:start position:0%
SSI dollars so that the foster home has
 
02:08:06.669 --> 02:08:06.679 align:start position:0%
access to meet their extraordinary needs
 
02:08:09.430 --> 02:08:09.440 align:start position:0%
um might they need some specialized um
 
02:08:11.629 --> 02:08:11.639 align:start position:0%
care in the home might they need um
 
02:08:13.390 --> 02:08:13.400 align:start position:0%
specialized therapies and that sort of
 
02:08:15.229 --> 02:08:15.239 align:start position:0%
thing it would be really nice to see
 
02:08:16.950 --> 02:08:16.960 align:start position:0%
those children have access to those
 
02:08:18.510 --> 02:08:18.520 align:start position:0%
dollars to meet their extraordinary
 
02:08:20.589 --> 02:08:20.599 align:start position:0%
needs but again I believe and the
 
02:08:22.069 --> 02:08:22.079 align:start position:0%
department can please correct me if I'm
 
02:08:24.430 --> 02:08:24.440 align:start position:0%
wrong that the vast majority of those
 
02:08:27.189 --> 02:08:27.199 align:start position:0%
$40 come from children and institutional
 
02:08:30.629 --> 02:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
care not children in community- based
 
02:08:33.510 --> 02:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
settings and again as the bill is
 
02:08:36.990 --> 02:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
written there even for children in in um
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
community based settings there would be
 
02:08:42.189 --> 02:08:42.199 align:start position:0%
no bar on the state claiming uh for any
 
02:08:44.109 --> 02:08:44.119 align:start position:0%
funds under this the bill as written
 
02:08:45.390 --> 02:08:45.400 align:start position:0%
there would just be that dollar for
 
02:08:45.400 --> 02:08:47.229 align:start position:0%
there would just be that dollar for
dooll

02:08:47.229 --> 02:08:47.239 align:start position:0%
dooll
 
02:08:50.229 --> 02:08:50.239 align:start position:0%
reduction okay okay representative
 
02:08:52.589 --> 02:08:52.599 align:start position:0%
Edwards thank you I think you may have
 
02:08:55.030 --> 02:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
actually answered my question in your
 
02:08:59.629 --> 02:08:59.639 align:start position:0%
very last sentence um it it it it it it
 
02:09:02.830 --> 02:09:02.840 align:start position:0%
sounds like the answer to number three
 
02:09:05.229 --> 02:09:05.239 align:start position:0%
on this question document do you have
 
02:09:09.030 --> 02:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
that in front of you yes okay that that
 
02:09:11.629 --> 02:09:11.639 align:start position:0%
if we can apply simultaneously for the
 
02:09:15.790 --> 02:09:15.800 align:start position:0%
4E money in addition to the SSI that the
 
02:09:17.709 --> 02:09:17.719 align:start position:0%
answer to number three may actually be
 
02:09:20.629 --> 02:09:20.639 align:start position:0%
different that Z it would be zero so
 
02:09:24.750 --> 02:09:24.760 align:start position:0%
instead of 74,000 we'd be talking Z zero
 
02:09:28.870 --> 02:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
so no loss from no loss do Mr White may
 
02:09:31.709 --> 02:09:31.719 align:start position:0%
I yes M Mr White do you have a an
 
02:09:33.390 --> 02:09:33.400 align:start position:0%
observation on
 
02:09:36.790 --> 02:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
that the challenge is is we we
 
02:09:40.069 --> 02:09:40.079 align:start position:0%
can't and and this this is based off of
 
02:09:43.790 --> 02:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
um our understanding and uh coming from
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
Decades of experience on the financial
 
02:09:48.430 --> 02:09:48.440 align:start position:0%
team um that that have historically
 
02:09:50.709 --> 02:09:50.719 align:start position:0%
manage this historically our
 
02:09:52.310 --> 02:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
understanding based on our conversations
 
02:09:53.910 --> 02:09:53.920 align:start position:0%
with our Auditors is that we're not able
 
02:09:55.430 --> 02:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
to claim both which is why we're
 
02:09:57.549 --> 02:09:57.559 align:start position:0%
basically seeing some general fund
 
02:09:58.669 --> 02:09:58.679 align:start position:0%
impact and I think what's really
 
02:10:01.549 --> 02:10:01.559 align:start position:0%
important here is not to focus
 
02:10:05.189 --> 02:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
necessarily whether it's the 74,000 here
 
02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
or the 1.4 million um the other impact
 
02:10:11.629 --> 02:10:11.639 align:start position:0%
for the total 2 million is from a policy
 
02:10:13.950 --> 02:10:13.960 align:start position:0%
perspective we are going to have some
 
02:10:16.390 --> 02:10:16.400 align:start position:0%
impact on General funds and again I'm
 
02:10:18.069 --> 02:10:18.079 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm speaking of it I'm speaking at
 
02:10:20.229 --> 02:10:20.239 align:start position:0%
the through the financial lens whether
 
02:10:23.470 --> 02:10:23.480 align:start position:0%
it's $1.5 million general fund hit or $3
 
02:10:25.549 --> 02:10:25.559 align:start position:0%
million general fund hit depending on
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
the year and utilization we will have
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
some impact so whether it's 500,000 this
 
02:10:32.910 --> 02:10:32.920 align:start position:0%
year and a million dollars next year you
 
02:10:35.109 --> 02:10:35.119 align:start position:0%
know ultimately what this really comes
 
02:10:37.229 --> 02:10:37.239 align:start position:0%
down to is we know we'll need additional
 
02:10:39.430 --> 02:10:39.440 align:start position:0%
General funds and we know this is a
 
02:10:41.950 --> 02:10:41.960 align:start position:0%
policy decision um I I just kind of want
 
02:10:45.149 --> 02:10:45.159 align:start position:0%
to level set the the the floor with with
 
02:10:47.910 --> 02:10:47.920 align:start position:0%
that statement um because when we don't
 
02:10:49.830 --> 02:10:49.840 align:start position:0%
know for example when we start to
 
02:10:51.910 --> 02:10:51.920 align:start position:0%
prepare our budget for the next year
 
02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
this coming August which we'll submit in
 
02:10:55.589 --> 02:10:55.599 align:start position:0%
September we'll be making certain
 
02:10:57.310 --> 02:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
assumptions about utilization we'll be
 
02:10:58.950 --> 02:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
making certain assumptions about what
 
02:11:00.310 --> 02:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
we'll need in federal funds and what
 
02:11:02.750 --> 02:11:02.760 align:start position:0%
we'll need in general funds and so I
 
02:11:04.310 --> 02:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
know that we're getting very much into
 
02:11:06.149 --> 02:11:06.159 align:start position:0%
the weeds and details here but I think
 
02:11:07.870 --> 02:11:07.880 align:start position:0%
it's important not to lose sight of the
 
02:11:09.870 --> 02:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
big picture ultimately it's a policy
 
02:11:11.589 --> 02:11:11.599 align:start position:0%
decision that will have some impact on
 
02:11:13.549 --> 02:11:13.559 align:start position:0%
General funds and we just don't know how
 
02:11:15.950 --> 02:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
much it this is our best estimate based
 
02:11:18.790 --> 02:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
on on the information that we have which
 
02:11:21.589 --> 02:11:21.599 align:start position:0%
isn't necessarily kept in our financial
 
02:11:23.629 --> 02:11:23.639 align:start position:0%
system for this type of analysis which
 
02:11:25.510 --> 02:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
is part of the reason why in question
 
02:11:28.229 --> 02:11:28.239 align:start position:0%
three we were recommending uh some type
 
02:11:31.830 --> 02:11:31.840 align:start position:0%
of further analysis relative to this um
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
because this is the best information
 
02:11:34.830 --> 02:11:34.840 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
02:11:37.109 --> 02:11:37.119 align:start position:0%
available representative
 
02:11:40.430 --> 02:11:40.440 align:start position:0%
hle thank you you mentioned that you had
 
02:11:42.350 --> 02:11:42.360 align:start position:0%
spoken with the Auditors on this and
 
02:11:44.310 --> 02:11:44.320 align:start position:0%
they LED you to believe that you could
 
02:11:46.549 --> 02:11:46.559 align:start position:0%
not concurrently ask for both funds is
 
02:11:48.350 --> 02:11:48.360 align:start position:0%
that a document that was put in writing
 
02:11:50.750 --> 02:11:50.760 align:start position:0%
anywhere that could be supplied I I I I
 
02:11:53.229 --> 02:11:53.239 align:start position:0%
tried to Contex to to clarify um
 
02:11:54.990 --> 02:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
representative H I tried to CL try to
 
02:11:57.310 --> 02:11:57.320 align:start position:0%
contextualize that within the experience
 
02:12:00.229 --> 02:12:00.239 align:start position:0%
of the team so we John and I we've been
 
02:12:02.830 --> 02:12:02.840 align:start position:0%
having conversations um with with my
 
02:12:05.510 --> 02:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
Deputy CFO who has 27 years experience
 
02:12:07.310 --> 02:12:07.320 align:start position:0%
working in this area and is very
 
02:12:09.990 --> 02:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
well-versed and it's her understanding
 
02:12:11.709 --> 02:12:11.719 align:start position:0%
based on those years of experience that
 
02:12:16.430 --> 02:12:16.440 align:start position:0%
we cannot claim both however um if we're
 
02:12:18.189 --> 02:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
more than happy to try to examine that
 
02:12:21.950 --> 02:12:21.960 align:start position:0%
further but in the event that you know
 
02:12:25.189 --> 02:12:25.199 align:start position:0%
maybe if you could claim a dollar of SSI
 
02:12:26.990 --> 02:12:27.000 align:start position:0%
but you may still have additional 4E
 
02:12:28.189 --> 02:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
that would probably just be a further
 
02:12:29.990 --> 02:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
administrative burden so we would just
 
02:12:31.830 --> 02:12:31.840 align:start position:0%
need to recognize that but that's how we
 
02:12:33.709 --> 02:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
were interpreting this to
 
02:12:38.270 --> 02:12:38.280 align:start position:0%
date follow up thank you if there was a
 
02:12:40.870 --> 02:12:40.880 align:start position:0%
chance to ask the auditor that worked
 
02:12:42.350 --> 02:12:42.360 align:start position:0%
presumably the auditor coming out of the
 
02:12:43.830 --> 02:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
federal government that you're working
 
02:12:48.430 --> 02:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
with no uh so so the auditors uh the
 
02:12:50.910 --> 02:12:50.920 align:start position:0%
legislative budget assistant hires uh
 
02:12:53.629 --> 02:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
the the the the single Statewide auditor
 
02:12:58.270 --> 02:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:13:01.310 --> 02:13:01.320 align:start position:0%
KPMG Miss Dylan your mic is on did you
 
02:13:02.990 --> 02:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
have further
 
02:13:05.109 --> 02:13:05.119 align:start position:0%
information no I would just I would just
 
02:13:07.549 --> 02:13:07.559 align:start position:0%
point out again that in in terms of I
 
02:13:09.270 --> 02:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
don't know what in terms of the auditor
 
02:13:10.790 --> 02:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
is saying but for the purposes of
 
02:13:13.549 --> 02:13:13.559 align:start position:0%
children collecting SSI and SSDI
 
02:13:15.510 --> 02:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
benefits as long as they're within the
 
02:13:17.549 --> 02:13:17.559 align:start position:0%
parameters of that income limit of that
 
02:13:20.589 --> 02:13:20.599 align:start position:0%
94 43 they can collect both so most of
 
02:13:22.629 --> 02:13:22.639 align:start position:0%
the time those title do title two
 
02:13:24.390 --> 02:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
benefits the the benefits they receive
 
02:13:26.270 --> 02:13:26.280 align:start position:0%
under the record of a parent would be
 
02:13:28.589 --> 02:13:28.599 align:start position:0%
significantly lower allowing a child to
 
02:13:31.430 --> 02:13:31.440 align:start position:0%
collect both benefits at the same time
 
02:13:33.709 --> 02:13:33.719 align:start position:0%
um and for the purposes of the 4E I
 
02:13:35.589 --> 02:13:35.599 align:start position:0%
can't imagine what other bar would exist
 
02:13:37.109 --> 02:13:37.119 align:start position:0%
other than Meeting those income and
 
02:13:38.830 --> 02:13:38.840 align:start position:0%
resource requirements to collect both
 
02:13:40.950 --> 02:13:40.960 align:start position:0%
benefits I haven't seen anything that
 
02:13:43.030 --> 02:13:43.040 align:start position:0%
would prohibit it otherwise my kiddos
 
02:13:44.910 --> 02:13:44.920 align:start position:0%
have received other forms of payment
 
02:13:46.310 --> 02:13:46.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes a parent qualifies for a
 
02:13:48.189 --> 02:13:48.199 align:start position:0%
pension that's below the 943 and they
 
02:13:50.069 --> 02:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
can collect that on behalf of the
 
02:13:52.189 --> 02:13:52.199 align:start position:0%
deceased parent in addition to their SSI
 
02:13:54.549 --> 02:13:54.559 align:start position:0%
benefit so as long as really the
 
02:13:56.149 --> 02:13:56.159 align:start position:0%
financial barriers are the only thing
 
02:13:58.270 --> 02:13:58.280 align:start position:0%
that prohibit SSI recipients from
 
02:13:59.750 --> 02:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
claiming other benefits they may be
 
02:13:59.760 --> 02:14:03.030 align:start position:0%
claiming other benefits they may be
qualified

02:14:03.030 --> 02:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:05.910 --> 02:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
for yes representative
 
02:14:09.709 --> 02:14:09.719 align:start position:0%
Edwards okay so um it's it's outside of
 
02:14:11.430 --> 02:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
the boundaries of what we're trying to
 
02:14:14.109 --> 02:14:14.119 align:start position:0%
do uh to get ready for a vote on this
 
02:14:17.229 --> 02:14:17.239 align:start position:0%
bill but it does seem like maybe for the
 
02:14:21.270 --> 02:14:21.280 align:start position:0%
good of the state if Mr White can get
 
02:14:23.549 --> 02:14:23.559 align:start position:0%
whatever documentation that indicates
 
02:14:26.790 --> 02:14:26.800 align:start position:0%
that we can claim or ask for both that
 
02:14:29.310 --> 02:14:29.320 align:start position:0%
that may improve our own collection
 
02:14:31.750 --> 02:14:31.760 align:start position:0%
Services internal to the department I
 
02:14:33.430 --> 02:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying it will I'm just saying
 
02:14:36.149 --> 02:14:36.159 align:start position:0%
it might so so if we could just double
 
02:14:38.910 --> 02:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
check because that sounds like you know
 
02:14:41.149 --> 02:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
we could fund some of these other bills
 
02:14:43.709 --> 02:14:43.719 align:start position:0%
with the 74,000 so it is kind of
 
02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:46.360 align:start position:0%
relevant to what we're doing and and Mr
 
02:14:48.589 --> 02:14:48.599 align:start position:0%
chair I just I just like to
 
02:14:51.229 --> 02:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
um I really appreciate that question and
 
02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
I and I do think that it's a probably a
 
02:14:55.109 --> 02:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
pretty simple answer and I would just
 
02:14:56.709 --> 02:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
want to caution the Committee Against
 
02:14:59.750 --> 02:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
spending $200,000 to get the answer
 
02:15:01.510 --> 02:15:01.520 align:start position:0%
because I do think that that's a basic
 
02:15:04.069 --> 02:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
statutory question that I would like the
 
02:15:06.510 --> 02:15:06.520 align:start position:0%
department to investigate prior to
 
02:15:08.510 --> 02:15:08.520 align:start position:0%
delaying the bill in any way spending
 
02:15:10.910 --> 02:15:10.920 align:start position:0%
200,000 $200,000 to get the answer to
 
02:15:10.920 --> 02:15:14.589 align:start position:0%
200,000 $200,000 to get the answer to
that

02:15:14.589 --> 02:15:14.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:16.790 --> 02:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
question Miss Young do you have a
 
02:15:16.800 --> 02:15:19.149 align:start position:0%
question Miss Young do you have a
comment

02:15:19.149 --> 02:15:19.159 align:start position:0%
comment
 
02:15:21.549 --> 02:15:21.559 align:start position:0%
I of I of course disagree I I don't
 
02:15:23.990 --> 02:15:24.000 align:start position:0%
think it's just answering that question
 
02:15:27.030 --> 02:15:27.040 align:start position:0%
and I also think you have multiple
 
02:15:29.629 --> 02:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
people who work with this and we
 
02:15:32.470 --> 02:15:32.480 align:start position:0%
all understand this title 4E a little
 
02:15:34.270 --> 02:15:34.280 align:start position:0%
differently based on our experiences
 
02:15:36.750 --> 02:15:36.760 align:start position:0%
this is not a simple statute to read
 
02:15:38.229 --> 02:15:38.239 align:start position:0%
there is nothing simple about social
 
02:15:39.910 --> 02:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
security fore is part of the Social
 
02:15:42.629 --> 02:15:42.639 align:start position:0%
Security Act just so that we all know
 
02:15:45.830 --> 02:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's all part of social security so I
 
02:15:48.109 --> 02:15:48.119 align:start position:0%
think what getting a consultant gives
 
02:15:52.270 --> 02:15:52.280 align:start position:0%
you gets you and gets The Advocates
 
02:15:54.350 --> 02:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
involved in this is the best answers
 
02:15:56.390 --> 02:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
that we can give not only on funding but
 
02:15:58.669 --> 02:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
on what we can do maybe even better than
 
02:16:00.549 --> 02:16:00.559 align:start position:0%
we're doing now and what we can do to
 
02:16:02.390 --> 02:16:02.400 align:start position:0%
change policy in a good way that serves
 
02:16:05.470 --> 02:16:05.480 align:start position:0%
the kids the best we can um and in the
 
02:16:07.629 --> 02:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
best way with the the best possible
 
02:16:09.589 --> 02:16:09.599 align:start position:0%
funding whether it be more or less you
 
02:16:11.030 --> 02:16:11.040 align:start position:0%
know that's what the consultant can look
 
02:16:15.629 --> 02:16:15.639 align:start position:0%
at uh and see I I think even answering
 
02:16:17.229 --> 02:16:17.239 align:start position:0%
these questions you're you're seeing
 
02:16:19.750 --> 02:16:19.760 align:start position:0%
this that shows how much thought has to
 
02:16:22.030 --> 02:16:22.040 align:start position:0%
go into this and how much limitations we
 
02:16:24.669 --> 02:16:24.679 align:start position:0%
have right now on this timing to do that
 
02:16:26.350 --> 02:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
and so that that's why we feel the
 
02:16:29.669 --> 02:16:29.679 align:start position:0%
consultant to come in and help us and um
 
02:16:31.830 --> 02:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
and help The Advocates involved as well
 
02:16:35.030 --> 02:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
get the answers get them right and let
 
02:16:37.190 --> 02:16:37.200 align:start position:0%
us do a good job if this is going to be
 
02:16:39.070 --> 02:16:39.080 align:start position:0%
a policy
 
02:16:41.429 --> 02:16:41.439 align:start position:0%
change I just want to add one thing
 
02:16:44.150 --> 02:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
which is that I think that um it's
 
02:16:46.389 --> 02:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
interesting to note that even currently
 
02:16:48.549 --> 02:16:48.559 align:start position:0%
under current policy and under Social
 
02:16:50.349 --> 02:16:50.359 align:start position:0%
Security regulations the department is
 
02:16:52.549 --> 02:16:52.559 align:start position:0%
already required to account to the
 
02:16:55.389 --> 02:16:55.399 align:start position:0%
Social Security Administration about how
 
02:16:57.990 --> 02:16:58.000 align:start position:0%
the children's Social Security benefits
 
02:17:01.950 --> 02:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
are spent so there so I'm I think that
 
02:17:04.589 --> 02:17:04.599 align:start position:0%
the department already has people on
 
02:17:06.950 --> 02:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
board who are effectuating this
 
02:17:10.270 --> 02:17:10.280 align:start position:0%
responsibility and if it comes down to
 
02:17:12.709 --> 02:17:12.719 align:start position:0%
you know I I think my understanding is
 
02:17:14.030 --> 02:17:14.040 align:start position:0%
that it's possible to claim both and
 
02:17:15.429 --> 02:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
it's just going to be a reduction in the
 
02:17:18.150 --> 02:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
Social Security benefits for children on
 
02:17:21.750 --> 02:17:21.760 align:start position:0%
SSI but if that's not true um and it's
 
02:17:26.230 --> 02:17:26.240 align:start position:0%
not feasible to draw to collect both SSI
 
02:17:28.790 --> 02:17:28.800 align:start position:0%
and for E Benefits there's probably a
 
02:17:31.429 --> 02:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
pretty simple fix that could be put into
 
02:17:34.469 --> 02:17:34.479 align:start position:0%
this bill that would exclude um the
 
02:17:37.750 --> 02:17:37.760 align:start position:0%
requirement that the department take SSI
 
02:17:39.629 --> 02:17:39.639 align:start position:0%
benefits during the time that the child
 
02:17:42.230 --> 02:17:42.240 align:start position:0%
is in a residential institutional
 
02:17:45.270 --> 02:17:45.280 align:start position:0%
placement um I I think I I think we
 
02:17:46.429 --> 02:17:46.439 align:start position:0%
could all come together and probably
 
02:17:48.349 --> 02:17:48.359 align:start position:0%
come up with something that would meet
 
02:17:50.030 --> 02:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
that concern I think we just need to
 
02:17:53.309 --> 02:17:53.319 align:start position:0%
know the answer to the first question
 
02:17:56.549 --> 02:17:56.559 align:start position:0%
one question to look at might be you
 
02:17:58.790 --> 02:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
know I the we're talking about the kids
 
02:18:00.349 --> 02:18:00.359 align:start position:0%
that are coming in and there's that
 
02:18:02.110 --> 02:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
application for the kids that are coming
 
02:18:04.750 --> 02:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
in that are already on SSI is the
 
02:18:08.309 --> 02:18:08.319 align:start position:0%
department taking them off SSI to claim
 
02:18:10.190 --> 02:18:10.200 align:start position:0%
4E or are they just getting that dollar
 
02:18:12.389 --> 02:18:12.399 align:start position:0%
for dooll reduction
 
02:18:16.509 --> 02:18:16.519 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:16.519 --> 02:18:19.469 align:start position:0%
 
know

02:18:19.469 --> 02:18:19.479 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:18:21.910 --> 02:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
probably something to be looked into
 
02:18:24.750 --> 02:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Edwards this
 
02:18:28.030 --> 02:18:28.040 align:start position:0%
the question for the chair um it's it
 
02:18:31.150 --> 02:18:31.160 align:start position:0%
seems to me like we're we're learning
 
02:18:34.709 --> 02:18:34.719 align:start position:0%
things uh that would allow us to um put
 
02:18:37.509 --> 02:18:37.519 align:start position:0%
forward an amendment to this bill that
 
02:18:41.150 --> 02:18:41.160 align:start position:0%
would impr improve it some and so if if
 
02:18:45.070 --> 02:18:45.080 align:start position:0%
if I'm hearing this right um do we have
 
02:18:47.509 --> 02:18:47.519 align:start position:0%
a legislator on in division through
 
02:18:51.110 --> 02:18:51.120 align:start position:0%
three that is taking the lead on working
 
02:18:53.309 --> 02:18:53.319 align:start position:0%
with the folks much like representative
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
walner is on the other Bill to to to to
 
02:18:59.389 --> 02:18:59.399 align:start position:0%
create try to create an
 
02:19:02.190 --> 02:19:02.200 align:start position:0%
amendment it's a it's a tasking issue a
 
02:19:04.509 --> 02:19:04.519 align:start position:0%
delegation issue or do we have anyone
 
02:19:07.990 --> 02:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
identified who wants to own an
 
02:19:10.309 --> 02:19:10.319 align:start position:0%
amendment I believe that uh the answer
 
02:19:11.589 --> 02:19:11.599 align:start position:0%
to your question is I don't know of any
 
02:19:13.830 --> 02:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
right now however representative walner
 
02:19:15.669 --> 02:19:15.679 align:start position:0%
is the prime sponsor I'm also on the
 
02:19:17.589 --> 02:19:17.599 align:start position:0%
bill I'm sure we can work with all of
 
02:19:20.110 --> 02:19:20.120 align:start position:0%
the parties here uh to create such an
 
02:19:23.669 --> 02:19:23.679 align:start position:0%
amendment that you mention okay that
 
02:19:26.429 --> 02:19:26.439 align:start position:0%
being said uh we've been at this now for
 
02:19:28.669 --> 02:19:28.679 align:start position:0%
almost 40 minutes and we do have other
 
02:19:32.270 --> 02:19:32.280 align:start position:0%
bills on the docket my intention is to
 
02:19:34.549 --> 02:19:34.559 align:start position:0%
go through the next two questions uh
 
02:19:36.990 --> 02:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
with that being said uh in the similar
 
02:19:39.950 --> 02:19:39.960 align:start position:0%
manner that we are now and then
 
02:19:42.870 --> 02:19:42.880 align:start position:0%
rescheduling this for the follow-up
 
02:19:44.910 --> 02:19:44.920 align:start position:0%
items that we have discovered along the
 
02:19:47.509 --> 02:19:47.519 align:start position:0%
way as well as any particular Amendment
 
02:19:50.110 --> 02:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
language that we come up with for the
 
02:19:52.469 --> 02:19:52.479 align:start position:0%
next work session or perhaps even one
 
02:19:55.870 --> 02:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
after that okay we're going to go now to
 
02:19:55.880 --> 02:19:56.710 align:start position:0%
after that okay we're going to go now to
question

02:19:56.710 --> 02:19:56.720 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:19:59.429 --> 02:19:59.439 align:start position:0%
four how did the department calculate
 
02:19:59.439 --> 02:20:00.230 align:start position:0%
four how did the department calculate
the

02:20:00.230 --> 02:20:00.240 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:20:05.750 --> 02:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
$1.4 million loss in federal SSI Revenue
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
also in the fiscal note Mr
 
02:20:13.110 --> 02:20:13.120 align:start position:0%
White this was the actual SSI uh Revenue
 
02:20:16.070 --> 02:20:16.080 align:start position:0%
that was earned in state fiscal year 23
 
02:20:18.590 --> 02:20:18.600 align:start position:0%
for the initial fiscal note um the
 
02:20:20.950 --> 02:20:20.960 align:start position:0%
department actually received think about
 
02:20:22.990 --> 02:20:23.000 align:start position:0%
160 fiscal note requests this year which
 
02:20:25.389 --> 02:20:25.399 align:start position:0%
was a record and we had about 5 days to
 
02:20:27.110 --> 02:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
turn those around so we try to provide
 
02:20:29.309 --> 02:20:29.319 align:start position:0%
the best information possible in the
 
02:20:32.110 --> 02:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
initial fiscal note this is the updated
 
02:20:35.030 --> 02:20:35.040 align:start position:0%
revised uh fiscal note here and again
 
02:20:37.309 --> 02:20:37.319 align:start position:0%
this is based on the actual State fiscal
 
02:20:40.910 --> 02:20:40.920 align:start position:0%
year 23 Revenue uh were the bill to pass
 
02:20:42.630 --> 02:20:42.640 align:start position:0%
um we would need an equivalent amount of
 
02:20:42.640 --> 02:20:43.590 align:start position:0%
um we would need an equivalent amount of
General

02:20:43.590 --> 02:20:43.600 align:start position:0%
General
 
02:20:47.309 --> 02:20:47.319 align:start position:0%
funds uh to uh to maintain that in state
 
02:20:50.030 --> 02:20:50.040 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh 26 and each year
 
02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:51.510 align:start position:0%
fiscal year uh 26 and each year
thereafter

02:20:51.510 --> 02:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
thereafter
 
02:20:54.990 --> 02:20:55.000 align:start position:0%
so thank you for that any followup or
 
02:20:56.830 --> 02:20:56.840 align:start position:0%
thoughts questions anyone around the
 
02:20:59.150 --> 02:20:59.160 align:start position:0%
table or in the
 
02:21:02.670 --> 02:21:02.680 align:start position:0%
center okay moving on then question
 
02:21:05.510 --> 02:21:05.520 align:start position:0%
number five what are the specific
 
02:21:08.750 --> 02:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
additional obligations triggered by this
 
02:21:12.790 --> 02:21:12.800 align:start position:0%
bill Beyond dcf's current obligations
 
02:21:15.429 --> 02:21:15.439 align:start position:0%
under Department policy and what are the
 
02:21:18.309 --> 02:21:18.319 align:start position:0%
expected duties of each additional
 
02:21:21.030 --> 02:21:21.040 align:start position:0%
needed staff
 
02:21:24.870 --> 02:21:24.880 align:start position:0%
member Miss Young yes so today we deal
 
02:21:26.230 --> 02:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
with those children coming in who are
 
02:21:28.429 --> 02:21:28.439 align:start position:0%
already receiving a benefit this bill
 
02:21:30.309 --> 02:21:30.319 align:start position:0%
would us to deter would require us to
 
02:21:31.750 --> 02:21:31.760 align:start position:0%
determine whether or not children who do
 
02:21:34.429 --> 02:21:34.439 align:start position:0%
not have a currently receive a benefit
 
02:21:36.230 --> 02:21:36.240 align:start position:0%
would be eligible and then take that a
 
02:21:39.070 --> 02:21:39.080 align:start position:0%
step further um and Safeguard it and
 
02:21:41.429 --> 02:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
then it also requires that every year
 
02:21:44.270 --> 02:21:44.280 align:start position:0%
thereafter should it be a child that
 
02:21:47.790 --> 02:21:47.800 align:start position:0%
remains in in care uh what that goes
 
02:21:52.150 --> 02:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
into is right now we have an accounting
 
02:21:53.710 --> 02:21:53.720 align:start position:0%
process that and that's required by
 
02:21:55.790 --> 02:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
Social Security and it goes to cost of
 
02:21:57.469 --> 02:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
care you've heard us say that so that's
 
02:22:01.590 --> 02:22:01.600 align:start position:0%
in and out right um the difference would
 
02:22:04.510 --> 02:22:04.520 align:start position:0%
be as a fiduciary of money coming in
 
02:22:06.270 --> 02:22:06.280 align:start position:0%
that is not in and out and going to cost
 
02:22:08.950 --> 02:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
of care you're dealing with fiduciary
 
02:22:13.469 --> 02:22:13.479 align:start position:0%
decisions that is not a a simple task
 
02:22:15.230 --> 02:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
and it looks different for every kid
 
02:22:17.630 --> 02:22:17.640 align:start position:0%
those fiduciary decisions could be a
 
02:22:20.349 --> 02:22:20.359 align:start position:0%
daily ask of what needs does that kid
 
02:22:23.830 --> 02:22:23.840 align:start position:0%
have it could go into protecting those
 
02:22:26.030 --> 02:22:26.040 align:start position:0%
needs protecting the needs putting it in
 
02:22:28.510 --> 02:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
a trust putting it in an account of some
 
02:22:30.710 --> 02:22:30.720 align:start position:0%
sort that does not absolve any kind of
 
02:22:33.750 --> 02:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
fiduciary decisions that requires a
 
02:22:35.510 --> 02:22:35.520 align:start position:0%
monitoring process of making the
 
02:22:37.190 --> 02:22:37.200 align:start position:0%
decisions we kind of talked about that
 
02:22:38.550 --> 02:22:38.560 align:start position:0%
at the last session so I don't want to
 
02:22:42.030 --> 02:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
get into those details but also it
 
02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
requires the for the in andout of making
 
02:22:48.910 --> 02:22:48.920 align:start position:0%
sure that new kids come in eligibility
 
02:22:51.150 --> 02:22:51.160 align:start position:0%
we have to decide what's going on that
 
02:22:55.349 --> 02:22:55.359 align:start position:0%
could easily change um for from DayDay
 
02:22:58.110 --> 02:22:58.120 align:start position:0%
from Kid to Kid it also can change given
 
02:23:01.670 --> 02:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
the kids circumstances I think um we
 
02:23:03.590 --> 02:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
talked about how difficult it is to get
 
02:23:06.270 --> 02:23:06.280 align:start position:0%
on SSI that could be a difficult Road in
 
02:23:08.150 --> 02:23:08.160 align:start position:0%
terms of appeals and having an attorney
 
02:23:09.990 --> 02:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
that is monitoring that making sure it
 
02:23:12.469 --> 02:23:12.479 align:start position:0%
happens it also could be someone a staff
 
02:23:14.429 --> 02:23:14.439 align:start position:0%
person monitoring when a kid gets into
 
02:23:16.429 --> 02:23:16.439 align:start position:0%
care and gets the care that they need
 
02:23:17.630 --> 02:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
that means we've
 
02:23:19.750 --> 02:23:19.760 align:start position:0%
to go forward with Social Security and
 
02:23:22.230 --> 02:23:22.240 align:start position:0%
that takes quite a bit of work as well
 
02:23:25.150 --> 02:23:25.160 align:start position:0%
um so what we looked at when we
 
02:23:28.429 --> 02:23:28.439 align:start position:0%
determined the Staffing for this was all
 
02:23:30.230 --> 02:23:30.240 align:start position:0%
that combined of we have kids going in
 
02:23:32.190 --> 02:23:32.200 align:start position:0%
and out we have kids are going daily
 
02:23:33.870 --> 02:23:33.880 align:start position:0%
fiduciary decisions daily safeguarding
 
02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
decisions and then also decisions about
 
02:23:38.710 --> 02:23:38.720 align:start position:0%
who can manage those trusts for example
 
02:23:40.150 --> 02:23:40.160 align:start position:0%
is a state going to be a trustee of a
 
02:23:41.469 --> 02:23:41.479 align:start position:0%
Special Needs Trust or we going to be
 
02:23:43.269 --> 02:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
able to find someone else be IT
 
02:23:45.349 --> 02:23:45.359 align:start position:0%
professional or a family member and
 
02:23:47.389 --> 02:23:47.399 align:start position:0%
those are not easy decisions I think we
 
02:23:50.670 --> 02:23:50.680 align:start position:0%
have all seen cases of things going
 
02:23:54.269 --> 02:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
wrong with fucher Duty and it is not a
 
02:23:56.950 --> 02:23:56.960 align:start position:0%
light decision-making process and so we
 
02:23:59.870 --> 02:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
have purposely staffed it in a way that
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
we can make sure that we know where the
 
02:24:03.670 --> 02:24:03.680 align:start position:0%
money is where it's going and that it's
 
02:24:06.630 --> 02:24:06.640 align:start position:0%
going properly and being safeguarded and
 
02:24:08.190 --> 02:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
that's really what you see the Staffing
 
02:24:09.469 --> 02:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
when you have a legal you need an
 
02:24:12.269 --> 02:24:12.279 align:start position:0%
attorney to do that um you have to have
 
02:24:13.790 --> 02:24:13.800 align:start position:0%
an attorney that knows not only social
 
02:24:15.510 --> 02:24:15.520 align:start position:0%
security law but you have to have an
 
02:24:17.830 --> 02:24:17.840 align:start position:0%
attorney that knows probate for example
 
02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:19.560 align:start position:0%
I am fiduciary duties and then on top of
 
02:24:20.870 --> 02:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
that Staffing that attorney with
 
02:24:22.550 --> 02:24:22.560 align:start position:0%
paralegals and staff that can
 
02:24:24.830 --> 02:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
continually monitor the children in care
 
02:24:28.429 --> 02:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
again think of this going in and out um
 
02:24:30.550 --> 02:24:30.560 align:start position:0%
and making sure that it's being taken
 
02:24:34.070 --> 02:24:34.080 align:start position:0%
care of and that's that's the best we
 
02:24:35.429 --> 02:24:35.439 align:start position:0%
can do to kind of give the commit the
 
02:24:36.950 --> 02:24:36.960 align:start position:0%
big picture of what we were thinking
 
02:24:39.510 --> 02:24:39.520 align:start position:0%
when we staffed this very purposefully
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
very heavily because of the heavy
 
02:24:43.550 --> 02:24:43.560 align:start position:0%
fiduciary duty
 
02:24:47.550 --> 02:24:47.560 align:start position:0%
involved representative H thank you so
 
02:24:50.510 --> 02:24:50.520 align:start position:0%
in a hypothetical scenario you have a
 
02:24:52.990 --> 02:24:53.000 align:start position:0%
child who comes into the system right
 
02:24:55.750 --> 02:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
and is eligible for social security
 
02:24:58.630 --> 02:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
benefits and then for some reason
 
02:25:00.070 --> 02:25:00.080 align:start position:0%
whether it was a temporary illness
 
02:25:01.670 --> 02:25:01.680 align:start position:0%
temporary medical issue whatever drove
 
02:25:03.910 --> 02:25:03.920 align:start position:0%
them into that state they are no longer
 
02:25:06.670 --> 02:25:06.680 align:start position:0%
eligible a year or two later but if they
 
02:25:08.429 --> 02:25:08.439 align:start position:0%
were at six at the time are we still
 
02:25:10.510 --> 02:25:10.520 align:start position:0%
managing those funds up through the time
 
02:25:12.550 --> 02:25:12.560 align:start position:0%
they're 18 before they have access to
 
02:25:14.550 --> 02:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
them where how does that work are you
 
02:25:15.870 --> 02:25:15.880 align:start position:0%
talking about right now or under this
 
02:25:17.750 --> 02:25:17.760 align:start position:0%
bill under the proposed bill so under
 
02:25:18.790 --> 02:25:18.800 align:start position:0%
the I just want to make sure I
 
02:25:19.990 --> 02:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
understand the fact scenario so we have
 
02:25:22.990 --> 02:25:23.000 align:start position:0%
someone who came in who was receiving
 
02:25:26.190 --> 02:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
SSI correct um they now probably thanks
 
02:25:30.110 --> 02:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
of Social Security um and continuing a
 
02:25:32.030 --> 02:25:32.040 align:start position:0%
disability review they they no longer
 
02:25:34.190 --> 02:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
eligible correct that's right so now we
 
02:25:36.030 --> 02:25:36.040 align:start position:0%
have to find somewhere for that money to
 
02:25:38.590 --> 02:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
go that we've safeguarded right and you
 
02:25:41.469 --> 02:25:41.479 align:start position:0%
hold on to that until they're 18 is that
 
02:25:43.030 --> 02:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
what the plan would be the bill
 
02:25:45.670 --> 02:25:45.680 align:start position:0%
envisions safeguarding that for um
 
02:25:48.070 --> 02:25:48.080 align:start position:0%
benefits purposes and in that it would
 
02:25:49.269 --> 02:25:49.279 align:start position:0%
really depend how much money was
 
02:25:51.190 --> 02:25:51.200 align:start position:0%
involved we want to be have to be really
 
02:25:53.230 --> 02:25:53.240 align:start position:0%
careful about for example Medicaid
 
02:25:55.510 --> 02:25:55.520 align:start position:0%
benefits not having too much to that
 
02:25:57.990 --> 02:25:58.000 align:start position:0%
that kid's name but yes the idea in this
 
02:25:59.510 --> 02:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
this bill would be that the state
 
02:26:02.030 --> 02:26:02.040 align:start position:0%
safeguards it by either putting it into
 
02:26:05.750 --> 02:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
some kind of Safeguard account as long
 
02:26:08.150 --> 02:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
as they're disabled um at that point
 
02:26:10.950 --> 02:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
that you make it or receiving it yes and
 
02:26:15.630 --> 02:26:15.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:18.110 --> 02:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
care okay okay representative Edwards
 
02:26:18.120 --> 02:26:19.070 align:start position:0%
care okay okay representative Edwards
was

02:26:19.070 --> 02:26:19.080 align:start position:0%
was
 
02:26:19.080 --> 02:26:24.349 align:start position:0%
was
next

02:26:24.349 --> 02:26:24.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:29.030 --> 02:26:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:26:32.389 --> 02:26:32.399 align:start position:0%
Edwards so this last sentence in the
 
02:26:34.870 --> 02:26:34.880 align:start position:0%
answer to question five is the one that
 
02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
leaves me the most concerned where it
 
02:26:40.429 --> 02:26:40.439 align:start position:0%
says that the complexities of managing
 
02:26:43.230 --> 02:26:43.240 align:start position:0%
trusts and other unique accounts will
 
02:26:43.240 --> 02:26:44.590 align:start position:0%
trusts and other unique accounts will
increase

02:26:44.590 --> 02:26:44.600 align:start position:0%
increase
 
02:26:48.269 --> 02:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
workload um I don't think that we do
 
02:26:51.910 --> 02:26:51.920 align:start position:0%
anything in this area currently from a
 
02:26:55.750 --> 02:26:55.760 align:start position:0%
state's perspective of administering uh
 
02:27:00.030 --> 02:27:00.040 align:start position:0%
accounts for uh our citizens and if
 
02:27:02.790 --> 02:27:02.800 align:start position:0%
that's if that's
 
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
true if it's not true you correct me but
 
02:27:09.550 --> 02:27:09.560 align:start position:0%
if it is true it seems to me like we
 
02:27:15.349 --> 02:27:15.359 align:start position:0%
have to invent almost a a banking Branch
 
02:27:18.469 --> 02:27:18.479 align:start position:0%
to to do this and the and and making
 
02:27:21.830 --> 02:27:21.840 align:start position:0%
sure that we identify all of the federal
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
and state laws that we would now have to
 
02:27:27.469 --> 02:27:27.479 align:start position:0%
comply with that seems like it still
 
02:27:30.190 --> 02:27:30.200 align:start position:0%
needs it would need to be done and then
 
02:27:32.389 --> 02:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
the policies and procedures and the
 
02:27:35.469 --> 02:27:35.479 align:start position:0%
training and the hiring this just seems
 
02:27:40.950 --> 02:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
like a massive part of the bill that I I
 
02:27:44.030 --> 02:27:44.040 align:start position:0%
I I'm sort of just concerned that we do
 
02:27:46.389 --> 02:27:46.399 align:start position:0%
not underestimate do do you have any
 
02:27:48.630 --> 02:27:48.640 align:start position:0%
comments comments on that I think that
 
02:27:50.269 --> 02:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
is accurate I will say we do have state
 
02:27:51.790 --> 02:27:51.800 align:start position:0%
institutions that have personal needs
 
02:27:53.590 --> 02:27:53.600 align:start position:0%
accounts I think of for instance Glen
 
02:27:56.349 --> 02:27:56.359 align:start position:0%
Cliff home um if someone is on Medicaid
 
02:27:57.550 --> 02:27:57.560 align:start position:0%
which Glen Cliff I believe almost
 
02:28:00.150 --> 02:28:00.160 align:start position:0%
everyone is on Medicaid they get 70 I
 
02:28:01.550 --> 02:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
think it might have gone up to $90 a
 
02:28:04.070 --> 02:28:04.080 align:start position:0%
month um that they can keep you know for
 
02:28:05.590 --> 02:28:05.600 align:start position:0%
their accounts I will to get that caveat
 
02:28:07.309 --> 02:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
that the that is a state institution so
 
02:28:10.110 --> 02:28:10.120 align:start position:0%
technically we do manage those funds
 
02:28:12.030 --> 02:28:12.040 align:start position:0%
though they normally have a guardian
 
02:28:14.150 --> 02:28:14.160 align:start position:0%
that does so in terms of but in terms of
 
02:28:15.630 --> 02:28:15.640 align:start position:0%
having a collective State account that's
 
02:28:18.030 --> 02:28:18.040 align:start position:0%
the one I I thought of after we met last
 
02:28:19.349 --> 02:28:19.359 align:start position:0%
but yes this would be the state getting
 
02:28:23.110 --> 02:28:23.120 align:start position:0%
into the fiduciary Services business um
 
02:28:26.990 --> 02:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
which is different than what we do
 
02:28:30.830 --> 02:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
now different in the sense that it uh
 
02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
causes us to need to comply with
 
02:28:36.670 --> 02:28:36.680 align:start position:0%
additional federal law um and if
 
02:28:39.590 --> 02:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
so do we just think that or do we have
 
02:28:41.710 --> 02:28:41.720 align:start position:0%
we identified new federal law we'd have
 
02:28:45.309 --> 02:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
to comply with we already act as
 
02:28:47.990 --> 02:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
fiduciary in terms of personal um or as
 
02:28:49.830 --> 02:28:49.840 align:start position:0%
representative pay for those kids like
 
02:28:51.630 --> 02:28:51.640 align:start position:0%
we talked about it's in and out though
 
02:28:54.110 --> 02:28:54.120 align:start position:0%
right we have regular audits with social
 
02:28:56.110 --> 02:28:56.120 align:start position:0%
security for that right now so we meet
 
02:28:58.590 --> 02:28:58.600 align:start position:0%
that we would have to meet that again as
 
02:29:00.510 --> 02:29:00.520 align:start position:0%
an organizational representative P but
 
02:29:02.590 --> 02:29:02.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's a it's different it's not just
 
02:29:04.750 --> 02:29:04.760 align:start position:0%
in and out uh so we would have to meet
 
02:29:09.429 --> 02:29:09.439 align:start position:0%
those regulations in terms of others um
 
02:29:11.429 --> 02:29:11.439 align:start position:0%
we you heard me talk about meeting
 
02:29:13.590 --> 02:29:13.600 align:start position:0%
Medicaid U making sure that Medicaid
 
02:29:16.070 --> 02:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
funding that those those dollars are
 
02:29:19.550 --> 02:29:19.560 align:start position:0%
safe started in a way um and
 
02:29:21.870 --> 02:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
in and I have to come back and think
 
02:29:23.190 --> 02:29:23.200 align:start position:0%
about the different you know you asked
 
02:29:25.630 --> 02:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
about Federal but then we also have
 
02:29:28.030 --> 02:29:28.040 align:start position:0%
state expectations of our probate court
 
02:29:31.510 --> 02:29:31.520 align:start position:0%
system that it's a question of whether
 
02:29:33.070 --> 02:29:33.080 align:start position:0%
we would have to open a guardianship
 
02:29:34.870 --> 02:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
over the estate to even be able to
 
02:29:37.750 --> 02:29:37.760 align:start position:0%
create a Special Needs Trust for a kid
 
02:29:39.070 --> 02:29:39.080 align:start position:0%
because right now it's guardianship over
 
02:29:41.910 --> 02:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
the person uh that's that's really you
 
02:29:45.309 --> 02:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
think about over the person is you know
 
02:29:46.830 --> 02:29:46.840 align:start position:0%
where someone lives Medical care
 
02:29:48.790 --> 02:29:48.800 align:start position:0%
decisions of a kid now we're getting
 
02:29:50.950 --> 02:29:50.960 align:start position:0%
into financial decisions and I think we
 
02:29:53.349 --> 02:29:53.359 align:start position:0%
would open up a world that the court
 
02:29:56.070 --> 02:29:56.080 align:start position:0%
would be very mindful because these
 
02:29:58.429 --> 02:29:58.439 align:start position:0%
these kids are under the jurisdiction of
 
02:30:00.309 --> 02:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
of the court in terms of guardianship if
 
02:30:04.070 --> 02:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
they're in care for the most part um we
 
02:30:05.590 --> 02:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
would want to make sure that we're in
 
02:30:08.150 --> 02:30:08.160 align:start position:0%
line with that I do not know I know you
 
02:30:10.670 --> 02:30:10.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned bank I do not know um if we
 
02:30:12.550 --> 02:30:12.560 align:start position:0%
would be subject to any kind of banking
 
02:30:13.910 --> 02:30:13.920 align:start position:0%
or anything like that that's something
 
02:30:16.550 --> 02:30:16.560 align:start position:0%
I'd have to look into thank you madam
 
02:30:18.269 --> 02:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
chair thank you for the
 
02:30:20.950 --> 02:30:20.960 align:start position:0%
answer thank you and Miss
 
02:30:24.630 --> 02:30:24.640 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg M take oh I'm sorry it looks
 
02:30:28.790 --> 02:30:28.800 align:start position:0%
like fighting over it so Madam chair and
 
02:30:30.389 --> 02:30:30.399 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I think this is
 
02:30:33.790 --> 02:30:33.800 align:start position:0%
becoming um incredibly over complicated
 
02:30:35.950 --> 02:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
I think it's important to remember the
 
02:30:38.190 --> 02:30:38.200 align:start position:0%
state receives these benefits becomes
 
02:30:40.830 --> 02:30:40.840 align:start position:0%
the representative pay and is already
 
02:30:43.230 --> 02:30:43.240 align:start position:0%
the fiduciary they are already
 
02:30:45.309 --> 02:30:45.319 align:start position:0%
responsible for using or conserving
 
02:30:48.070 --> 02:30:48.080 align:start position:0%
these CH these these dollars in the best
 
02:30:49.910 --> 02:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
interest of the children they are
 
02:30:51.950 --> 02:30:51.960 align:start position:0%
currently making a choice to reimburse
 
02:30:53.790 --> 02:30:53.800 align:start position:0%
them themselves with it but they could
 
02:30:55.590 --> 02:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
make a choice to use it for the child's
 
02:30:58.110 --> 02:30:58.120 align:start position:0%
day-to-day benefit or conserve it that
 
02:31:00.950 --> 02:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
is no different they are already a
 
02:31:03.030 --> 02:31:03.040 align:start position:0%
fiduciary and any of the legal
 
02:31:05.590 --> 02:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that come with that are
 
02:31:09.750 --> 02:31:09.760 align:start position:0%
already on them the choice is reimburse
 
02:31:13.670 --> 02:31:13.680 align:start position:0%
thems or use it for the child and so the
 
02:31:16.070 --> 02:31:16.080 align:start position:0%
way we envision this if we're using it
 
02:31:18.190 --> 02:31:18.200 align:start position:0%
for the child or conserving it for the
 
02:31:20.910 --> 02:31:20.920 align:start position:0%
child that it would go into um a
 
02:31:23.670 --> 02:31:23.680 align:start position:0%
dedicated account just as they already
 
02:31:25.990 --> 02:31:26.000 align:start position:0%
do with retroactive benefits that a
 
02:31:27.910 --> 02:31:27.920 align:start position:0%
child may receive after they become
 
02:31:31.150 --> 02:31:31.160 align:start position:0%
eligible uh for for um
 
02:31:34.070 --> 02:31:34.080 align:start position:0%
SSI um which where they're already
 
02:31:36.910 --> 02:31:36.920 align:start position:0%
managing um specific accounts for the
 
02:31:39.150 --> 02:31:39.160 align:start position:0%
benefit of children um we see this
 
02:31:42.510 --> 02:31:42.520 align:start position:0%
working very very similarly where a jppo
 
02:31:44.790 --> 02:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
could say or or a child protection
 
02:31:46.670 --> 02:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
worker could say this child child just
 
02:31:48.750 --> 02:31:48.760 align:start position:0%
broke their glasses for the third time
 
02:31:51.309 --> 02:31:51.319 align:start position:0%
this month and insurance isn't going to
 
02:31:53.510 --> 02:31:53.520 align:start position:0%
cover it oh well that's a good use of
 
02:31:55.190 --> 02:31:55.200 align:start position:0%
this money and there's a an account for
 
02:31:57.590 --> 02:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
it or this child would really benefit
 
02:32:00.910 --> 02:32:00.920 align:start position:0%
from equestrian therapy oh there's a
 
02:32:03.389 --> 02:32:03.399 align:start position:0%
dedicated account for that so we don't
 
02:32:05.830 --> 02:32:05.840 align:start position:0%
see this as being this complicated
 
02:32:08.630 --> 02:32:08.640 align:start position:0%
process we don't see this as increasing
 
02:32:11.150 --> 02:32:11.160 align:start position:0%
the state's fiduciary obligations that
 
02:32:13.950 --> 02:32:13.960 align:start position:0%
they already have we only see this as
 
02:32:15.870 --> 02:32:15.880 align:start position:0%
ensuring the money is either used for
 
02:32:18.150 --> 02:32:18.160 align:start position:0%
the child 's benefit or conserved for
 
02:32:19.710 --> 02:32:19.720 align:start position:0%
the child's benefit instead of
 
02:32:22.030 --> 02:32:22.040 align:start position:0%
reimbursing themselves their legal
 
02:32:24.670 --> 02:32:24.680 align:start position:0%
obligations do not change what they
 
02:32:26.790 --> 02:32:26.800 align:start position:0%
would have to decide is where to put
 
02:32:28.910 --> 02:32:28.920 align:start position:0%
that money they could do a special needs
 
02:32:31.190 --> 02:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
trust but that's a more complicated
 
02:32:33.790 --> 02:32:33.800 align:start position:0%
expensive process we have able accounts
 
02:32:36.349 --> 02:32:36.359 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire which are a much easier
 
02:32:39.030 --> 02:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
process would somebody have to manage
 
02:32:42.510 --> 02:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
the um the the withdrawals from them yes
 
02:32:44.870 --> 02:32:44.880 align:start position:0%
and so could I see you know for um a
 
02:32:47.309 --> 02:32:47.319 align:start position:0%
hundred or so kids could I see and FTE
 
02:32:49.790 --> 02:32:49.800 align:start position:0%
maybe you know taking requests for these
 
02:32:52.349 --> 02:32:52.359 align:start position:0%
this money and and managing you know
 
02:32:54.910 --> 02:32:54.920 align:start position:0%
approving or denying each request I
 
02:32:56.830 --> 02:32:56.840 align:start position:0%
could see that but I could see that for
 
02:32:59.309 --> 02:32:59.319 align:start position:0%
one staff I don't see that for six or
 
02:33:02.269 --> 02:33:02.279 align:start position:0%
seven staff I think this is becoming
 
02:33:04.110 --> 02:33:04.120 align:start position:0%
massively overco complicated in a way
 
02:33:06.670 --> 02:33:06.680 align:start position:0%
that it just doesn't need to be as a
 
02:33:08.550 --> 02:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
reminder this legislation is modeled
 
02:33:12.190 --> 02:33:12.200 align:start position:0%
after Arizona law is that true yes do
 
02:33:15.349 --> 02:33:15.359 align:start position:0%
you know how many administrators manage
 
02:33:17.990 --> 02:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
their account
 
02:33:20.830 --> 02:33:20.840 align:start position:0%
perhaps um question we can look at that
 
02:33:22.830 --> 02:33:22.840 align:start position:0%
I remember looking at the fiscal note I
 
02:33:25.590 --> 02:33:25.600 align:start position:0%
have it and it was like two or three
 
02:33:28.190 --> 02:33:28.200 align:start position:0%
yeah it was fewer and and it was I think
 
02:33:30.590 --> 02:33:30.600 align:start position:0%
for like 1.5 million kids I do remember
 
02:33:32.030 --> 02:33:32.040 align:start position:0%
that number that the kid the amount of
 
02:33:33.990 --> 02:33:34.000 align:start position:0%
kids was in the millions representative
 
02:33:37.030 --> 02:33:37.040 align:start position:0%
Lon um thank you madam chair um this is
 
02:33:38.790 --> 02:33:38.800 align:start position:0%
definitely a complex topic but as
 
02:33:40.910 --> 02:33:40.920 align:start position:0%
somebody who is licensed by the SEC for
 
02:33:43.990 --> 02:33:44.000 align:start position:0%
far too long the idea that managing the
 
02:33:46.510 --> 02:33:46.520 align:start position:0%
funds in one way is the same as managing
 
02:33:48.389 --> 02:33:48.399 align:start position:0%
the funds so that they can be taken
 
02:33:50.590 --> 02:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
responsibly to these children as they're
 
02:33:52.830 --> 02:33:52.840 align:start position:0%
adult as they're out of the system um
 
02:33:54.750 --> 02:33:54.760 align:start position:0%
just brings up all sorts of red flags to
 
02:33:57.269 --> 02:33:57.279 align:start position:0%
me that management of preserving their
 
02:33:58.950 --> 02:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
assets and they're capital for their
 
02:34:01.469 --> 02:34:01.479 align:start position:0%
future opportunities is entirely
 
02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
different different than managing it for
 
02:34:05.389 --> 02:34:05.399 align:start position:0%
their current custodial care as part of
 
02:34:07.550 --> 02:34:07.560 align:start position:0%
the state and um I I can't tell you all
 
02:34:10.550 --> 02:34:10.560 align:start position:0%
the details of it but my red plags from
 
02:34:13.910 --> 02:34:13.920 align:start position:0%
all my SEC work really really has huge
 
02:34:15.830 --> 02:34:15.840 align:start position:0%
mind fields for this so I think we need
 
02:34:17.190 --> 02:34:17.200 align:start position:0%
to make make sure that we understand
 
02:34:19.429 --> 02:34:19.439 align:start position:0%
just what just what liability the state
 
02:34:21.790 --> 02:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
is taking on managing These funds for
 
02:34:23.790 --> 02:34:23.800 align:start position:0%
these children Megan would you I was
 
02:34:25.150 --> 02:34:25.160 align:start position:0%
just going to say could you explain how
 
02:34:27.870 --> 02:34:27.880 align:start position:0%
the reporting obligations were so just
 
02:34:29.750 --> 02:34:29.760 align:start position:0%
to your point and to my colleague's
 
02:34:33.710 --> 02:34:33.720 align:start position:0%
point I just wanted to say Point Blank
 
02:34:36.030 --> 02:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
that the state is not obligated to take
 
02:34:37.870 --> 02:34:37.880 align:start position:0%
on the fiduciary responsibility for
 
02:34:39.750 --> 02:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
reporting and be the representative pay
 
02:34:42.070 --> 02:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
for these children in fact the Social
 
02:34:43.790 --> 02:34:43.800 align:start position:0%
Security regulations and the Palms
 
02:34:46.190 --> 02:34:46.200 align:start position:0%
manuals make the state organization or
 
02:34:48.230 --> 02:34:48.240 align:start position:0%
welfare agency sixth or seventh in the
 
02:34:50.070 --> 02:34:50.080 align:start position:0%
preference line for being the rep paye
 
02:34:51.990 --> 02:34:52.000 align:start position:0%
for these children I certainly
 
02:34:53.190 --> 02:34:53.200 align:start position:0%
understand that there are situations
 
02:34:55.070 --> 02:34:55.080 align:start position:0%
where that maybe the child has no kin
 
02:34:56.830 --> 02:34:56.840 align:start position:0%
whatsoever that it's appropriate for the
 
02:34:59.429 --> 02:34:59.439 align:start position:0%
state to do so but in most instances a
 
02:35:01.349 --> 02:35:01.359 align:start position:0%
child may be in care and still have a
 
02:35:04.630 --> 02:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
very competent relative aunt Uncle
 
02:35:06.790 --> 02:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
adoptive parent whatever the situation
 
02:35:09.070 --> 02:35:09.080 align:start position:0%
may be that could manage those funds for
 
02:35:11.190 --> 02:35:11.200 align:start position:0%
them becoming a representative payes
 
02:35:13.870 --> 02:35:13.880 align:start position:0%
specific to Social Security and you
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
apply to become a rep paye so the state
 
02:35:18.790 --> 02:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
does not have to do that and the Social
 
02:35:20.630 --> 02:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
Security Administration has an
 
02:35:24.349 --> 02:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
obligation to vet find and appoint a
 
02:35:27.309 --> 02:35:27.319 align:start position:0%
representative PE that is the federal
 
02:35:30.030 --> 02:35:30.040 align:start position:0%
agency's responsibility not the states
 
02:35:33.190 --> 02:35:33.200 align:start position:0%
so they could choose very much so to put
 
02:35:34.910 --> 02:35:34.920 align:start position:0%
the onus back where it belongs on the
 
02:35:37.070 --> 02:35:37.080 align:start position:0%
federal agency and tell them to find
 
02:35:39.550 --> 02:35:39.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate payes for these kids many of
 
02:35:41.230 --> 02:35:41.240 align:start position:0%
which may have a vested emotional
 
02:35:43.309 --> 02:35:43.319 align:start position:0%
interest in that child as their relative
 
02:35:45.030 --> 02:35:45.040 align:start position:0%
or relatives friend or close family
 
02:35:47.830 --> 02:35:47.840 align:start position:0%
member and that's completely possible
 
02:35:50.550 --> 02:35:50.560 align:start position:0%
and we would eliminate a lot of the
 
02:35:53.070 --> 02:35:53.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility and the cost associated
 
02:35:54.830 --> 02:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
with managing those reporting if if
 
02:35:56.670 --> 02:35:56.680 align:start position:0%
that's done um and that's something that
 
02:35:59.070 --> 02:35:59.080 align:start position:0%
could be done um in addition to that the
 
02:36:01.710 --> 02:36:01.720 align:start position:0%
reporting responsibilities again when
 
02:36:03.510 --> 02:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
we're talking about children who are
 
02:36:05.590 --> 02:36:05.600 align:start position:0%
recipients of Social Security disability
 
02:36:07.990 --> 02:36:08.000 align:start position:0%
insurance or a title two benefit versus
 
02:36:10.070 --> 02:36:10.080 align:start position:0%
supplemental security income are very
 
02:36:12.630 --> 02:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
different again title 2 benefits don't
 
02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:14.920 align:start position:0%
require annual reporting they are not an
 
02:36:16.590 --> 02:36:16.600 align:start position:0%
income or needs based
 
02:36:19.349 --> 02:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
program so the reporting is much less um
 
02:36:21.070 --> 02:36:21.080 align:start position:0%
or not required in the same way it is
 
02:36:24.910 --> 02:36:24.920 align:start position:0%
for SSI and for most SSI kids a
 
02:36:27.750 --> 02:36:27.760 align:start position:0%
representative paye and this doesn't
 
02:36:29.950 --> 02:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
apply to parents or relatives who live
 
02:36:31.510 --> 02:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
with the child anymore are not required
 
02:36:34.349 --> 02:36:34.359 align:start position:0%
to do an annual reports a state agency
 
02:36:36.590 --> 02:36:36.600 align:start position:0%
or a welfare agency would be required as
 
02:36:40.070 --> 02:36:40.080 align:start position:0%
the rep P to do an annual reporting um
 
02:36:43.150 --> 02:36:43.160 align:start position:0%
it's an online reporting tool um as long
 
02:36:44.990 --> 02:36:45.000 align:start position:0%
as they are tracking how the child's
 
02:36:46.910 --> 02:36:46.920 align:start position:0%
expenses are being being used it can all
 
02:36:48.630 --> 02:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
be submitted at once in one in a
 
02:36:51.269 --> 02:36:51.279 align:start position:0%
one-time annual report there can be
 
02:36:53.230 --> 02:36:53.240 align:start position:0%
changes that can occur for children in
 
02:36:54.950 --> 02:36:54.960 align:start position:0%
care which I certainly understand like
 
02:36:57.790 --> 02:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
an address change or a name change or
 
02:36:59.469 --> 02:36:59.479 align:start position:0%
something else that needs to be reported
 
02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:01.520 align:start position:0%
but again that seems like a low lift in
 
02:37:03.670 --> 02:37:03.680 align:start position:0%
terms of reporting we report changes for
 
02:37:06.030 --> 02:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
clients and it's an online tool it's a
 
02:37:07.990 --> 02:37:08.000 align:start position:0%
simply a written statement to the agency
 
02:37:11.070 --> 02:37:11.080 align:start position:0%
the address is now this um it just
 
02:37:13.950 --> 02:37:13.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't feel as cumbersome in the way of
 
02:37:15.990 --> 02:37:16.000 align:start position:0%
for this many kids and especially they
 
02:37:17.910 --> 02:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have the responsibility this is a
 
02:37:19.750 --> 02:37:19.760 align:start position:0%
voluntary responsibility that the state
 
02:37:21.510 --> 02:37:21.520 align:start position:0%
is taking on to be the rep paye they
 
02:37:25.590 --> 02:37:25.600 align:start position:0%
don't have to be um so in that way you
 
02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:28.080 align:start position:0%
know and for kids you're talking about a
 
02:37:29.950 --> 02:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
lot less that's involved in the annual
 
02:37:31.630 --> 02:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
reporting for adults it's a lot more
 
02:37:33.870 --> 02:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
complicated because adults may be going
 
02:37:36.910 --> 02:37:36.920 align:start position:0%
back to work adults may be doing more
 
02:37:38.830 --> 02:37:38.840 align:start position:0%
things that can have impact on resource
 
02:37:40.510 --> 02:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
and income opening their own bank
 
02:37:42.910 --> 02:37:42.920 align:start position:0%
accounts that maybe other people aren't
 
02:37:45.389 --> 02:37:45.399 align:start position:0%
aware of children need adults to do all
 
02:37:48.790 --> 02:37:48.800 align:start position:0%
of this for them so the fact that things
 
02:37:50.429 --> 02:37:50.439 align:start position:0%
that are harder to report for adults
 
02:37:52.190 --> 02:37:52.200 align:start position:0%
because they have the authority to do it
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
themselves simply can't be done for kids
 
02:37:57.469 --> 02:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
so that reporting is not as intensive um
 
02:38:00.349 --> 02:38:00.359 align:start position:0%
so for all of those reasons primarily
 
02:38:01.910 --> 02:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
thinking that the state should strongly
 
02:38:03.469 --> 02:38:03.479 align:start position:0%
consider putting the onus back on the
 
02:38:05.670 --> 02:38:05.680 align:start position:0%
federal agency to find appropriate rep
 
02:38:07.389 --> 02:38:07.399 align:start position:0%
pay for these children and simply not
 
02:38:10.269 --> 02:38:10.279 align:start position:0%
choose to take that responsibility on um
 
02:38:12.070 --> 02:38:12.080 align:start position:0%
if the rep pay is appropriate and can
 
02:38:13.710 --> 02:38:13.720 align:start position:0%
continue to be appropriate then that
 
02:38:13.720 --> 02:38:14.710 align:start position:0%
continue to be appropriate then that
should

02:38:14.710 --> 02:38:14.720 align:start position:0%
should
 
02:38:14.720 --> 02:38:17.429 align:start position:0%
should
happen

02:38:17.429 --> 02:38:17.439 align:start position:0%
happen
 
02:38:19.429 --> 02:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
okay all
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
set all right r one thing I also wanted
 
02:38:24.670 --> 02:38:24.680 align:start position:0%
to call your attention to um some
 
02:38:26.830 --> 02:38:26.840 align:start position:0%
policies that Michelle werin distributed
 
02:38:29.429 --> 02:38:29.439 align:start position:0%
at your last work session so the
 
02:38:30.870 --> 02:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
division of children youth and families
 
02:38:32.469 --> 02:38:32.479 align:start position:0%
policy manual
 
02:38:36.670 --> 02:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
1676 talk um if you go to page three of
 
02:38:38.910 --> 02:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
that um this is the section that
 
02:38:41.269 --> 02:38:41.279 align:start position:0%
requires them to establish a dedicated
 
02:38:44.030 --> 02:38:44.040 align:start position:0%
account for any child who has six months
 
02:38:46.030 --> 02:38:46.040 align:start position:0%
or more past due benefits this comes up
 
02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
pretty frequently because the Social
 
02:38:49.309 --> 02:38:49.319 align:start position:0%
Security Administration takes a really
 
02:38:51.110 --> 02:38:51.120 align:start position:0%
long time to make eligibility
 
02:38:53.429 --> 02:38:53.439 align:start position:0%
determinations but they already have a
 
02:38:56.110 --> 02:38:56.120 align:start position:0%
process in place to make decisions about
 
02:38:58.990 --> 02:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
how to use a child's funds to meet their
 
02:39:01.830 --> 02:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs so and it lists you
 
02:39:06.030 --> 02:39:06.040 align:start position:0%
know what the process is for um you know
 
02:39:08.469 --> 02:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
creating a dedicated account and what
 
02:39:12.230 --> 02:39:12.240 align:start position:0%
kinds of um items can may be used from
 
02:39:13.790 --> 02:39:13.800 align:start position:0%
this dedicated account and what the
 
02:39:15.790 --> 02:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
reporting requirements are for that so
 
02:39:19.429 --> 02:39:19.439 align:start position:0%
the division already has a process in
 
02:39:22.349 --> 02:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
place thank
 
02:39:25.269 --> 02:39:25.279 align:start position:0%
you likewise I would just say I heard
 
02:39:26.830 --> 02:39:26.840 align:start position:0%
earlier that that one of the added
 
02:39:29.870 --> 02:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
obligations is the is an application to
 
02:39:31.710 --> 02:39:31.720 align:start position:0%
for benefits for CH for all children
 
02:39:34.670 --> 02:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
coming into the Ben into the system and
 
02:39:37.230 --> 02:39:37.240 align:start position:0%
currently they are o only um receiving
 
02:39:39.910 --> 02:39:39.920 align:start position:0%
the Social Security or SSI benefits of
 
02:39:41.990 --> 02:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
children who already received them again
 
02:39:44.309 --> 02:39:44.319 align:start position:0%
I just like to point the committee to um
 
02:39:47.550 --> 02:39:47.560 align:start position:0%
the the that same section of policies um
 
02:39:51.070 --> 02:39:51.080 align:start position:0%
that which also already requires them to
 
02:39:54.150 --> 02:39:54.160 align:start position:0%
apply for um Social Security benefits or
 
02:39:57.070 --> 02:39:57.080 align:start position:0%
SSI benefits for any children going into
 
02:39:59.670 --> 02:39:59.680 align:start position:0%
out of home care which is exactly in
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
line with what this bill requires
 
02:40:04.030 --> 02:40:04.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not they're doing it I don't
 
02:40:06.150 --> 02:40:06.160 align:start position:0%
know but they have a policy that
 
02:40:09.750 --> 02:40:09.760 align:start position:0%
requires um investigation of Eligibility
 
02:40:12.349 --> 02:40:12.359 align:start position:0%
um for each child going into an outof
 
02:40:15.190 --> 02:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
home placement and again this bill only
 
02:40:17.590 --> 02:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
requir re Ires an investigation of
 
02:40:20.630 --> 02:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
eligibility for each child going into
 
02:40:24.110 --> 02:40:24.120 align:start position:0%
care which I perceive means um out of
 
02:40:26.510 --> 02:40:26.520 align:start position:0%
home placement but assuming those are in
 
02:40:28.710 --> 02:40:28.720 align:start position:0%
line the policy is in line with the
 
02:40:28.720 --> 02:40:30.990 align:start position:0%
line the policy is in line with the
statute

02:40:30.990 --> 02:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
statute
 
02:40:33.150 --> 02:40:33.160 align:start position:0%
already yes Miss Dylan and I would just
 
02:40:35.030 --> 02:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
point out one more thing as far as the
 
02:40:37.950 --> 02:40:37.960 align:start position:0%
annual screening um and medical
 
02:40:40.230 --> 02:40:40.240 align:start position:0%
redeterminations once a child is found
 
02:40:43.389 --> 02:40:43.399 align:start position:0%
eligible for SSI benefits for themselves
 
02:40:44.750 --> 02:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of their own medical
 
02:40:47.110 --> 02:40:47.120 align:start position:0%
impairments that qualify them Social
 
02:40:48.910 --> 02:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
Security will review that child not less
 
02:40:52.150 --> 02:40:52.160 align:start position:0%
than every three years so so every three
 
02:40:54.469 --> 02:40:54.479 align:start position:0%
years is the maximum period of time that
 
02:40:55.830 --> 02:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
they're going to look again to see
 
02:40:57.550 --> 02:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
whether that child qualifies for the
 
02:40:59.389 --> 02:40:59.399 align:start position:0%
medically continues to qualify medically
 
02:41:01.710 --> 02:41:01.720 align:start position:0%
for that benefit unless there has been a
 
02:41:04.070 --> 02:41:04.080 align:start position:0%
major medical change reported or major
 
02:41:06.190 --> 02:41:06.200 align:start position:0%
medical improvement Social Security is
 
02:41:07.670 --> 02:41:07.680 align:start position:0%
not going to look at that medical
 
02:41:10.349 --> 02:41:10.359 align:start position:0%
eligibility again for until about 3
 
02:41:11.710 --> 02:41:11.720 align:start position:0%
years from the time the child is
 
02:41:14.030 --> 02:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
approved so I'm not sure that any type
 
02:41:17.429 --> 02:41:17.439 align:start position:0%
of annual screening medically for a
 
02:41:20.550 --> 02:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
child would be necessary at all unless
 
02:41:22.429 --> 02:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
there is a major medical change that you
 
02:41:24.510 --> 02:41:24.520 align:start position:0%
think now qualifies the child for
 
02:41:27.190 --> 02:41:27.200 align:start position:0%
disability that didn't exist at the time
 
02:41:30.349 --> 02:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
that they entered
 
02:41:32.990 --> 02:41:33.000 align:start position:0%
care okay thank you for that anything
 
02:41:35.150 --> 02:41:35.160 align:start position:0%
further we're still on question
 
02:41:35.160 --> 02:41:37.110 align:start position:0%
further we're still on question
five

02:41:37.110 --> 02:41:37.120 align:start position:0%
five
 
02:41:40.070 --> 02:41:40.080 align:start position:0%
okay that was a jam-packed almost one
 
02:41:43.710 --> 02:41:43.720 align:start position:0%
hour of um House Bill
 
02:41:46.550 --> 02:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
1598 so I want to thank everybody for
 
02:41:48.389 --> 02:41:48.399 align:start position:0%
first of all their time we are very
 
02:41:50.590 --> 02:41:50.600 align:start position:0%
mindful on this committee as to
 
02:41:54.110 --> 02:41:54.120 align:start position:0%
everybody's time and how valuable it is
 
02:41:56.389 --> 02:41:56.399 align:start position:0%
and we try to go as fast and be as uh
 
02:41:58.510 --> 02:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
concise as we can and sometimes that
 
02:42:00.590 --> 02:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't always work out but always know
 
02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
our intention is the same and that as we
 
02:42:04.990 --> 02:42:05.000 align:start position:0%
truly appreciate everybody's time and
 
02:42:07.309 --> 02:42:07.319 align:start position:0%
expertise and sharing information to
 
02:42:10.030 --> 02:42:10.040 align:start position:0%
help decisions be made appropriately so
 
02:42:12.510 --> 02:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
again thank you there are some items
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
that are for followup uh for example uh
 
02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
question one uh further data from the US
 
02:42:21.030 --> 02:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
02:42:25.469 --> 02:42:25.479 align:start position:0%
question three whether or not 4E and SSI
 
02:42:28.429 --> 02:42:28.439 align:start position:0%
uh there's a bar on both isn't there
 
02:42:29.590 --> 02:42:29.600 align:start position:0%
also there was a request for a
 
02:42:29.600 --> 02:42:30.550 align:start position:0%
also there was a request for a
dollar-to-dollar

02:42:30.550 --> 02:42:30.560 align:start position:0%
dollar-to-dollar
 
02:42:33.190 --> 02:42:33.200 align:start position:0%
comparison on question
 
02:42:35.110 --> 02:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
three those are just some of the
 
02:42:37.510 --> 02:42:37.520 align:start position:0%
follow-ups I have Arizona Personnel on
 
02:42:39.630 --> 02:42:39.640 align:start position:0%

three yes thank
 
02:43:31.990 --> 02:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
you okay so anything further from the
 
02:43:34.670 --> 02:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
members all right at this point I'm
 
02:43:36.910 --> 02:43:36.920 align:start position:0%
going to close the work session on House
 
02:43:39.190 --> 02:43:39.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 1598 with the full intention that
 
02:43:42.349 --> 02:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
this will be rescheduled to another work
 
02:43:44.870 --> 02:43:44.880 align:start position:0%
session through our division 3 chair
 
02:43:51.870 --> 02:43:51.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:43:57.389 --> 02:43:57.399 align:start position:0%
all nice nice work thank you um so the
 
02:43:59.429 --> 02:43:59.439 align:start position:0%
there are three things I still want to
 
02:44:02.550 --> 02:44:02.560 align:start position:0%
do uh before wrapping up and I I want to
 
02:44:05.110 --> 02:44:05.120 align:start position:0%
just for the everyone on the panel to
 
02:44:09.710 --> 02:44:09.720 align:start position:0%
know that um I I want to impose a hard
 
02:44:13.550 --> 02:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
stop at 4:15 why 4:15 because we should
 
02:44:16.469 --> 02:44:16.479 align:start position:0%
be out of the building by 4 to let Janet
 
02:44:19.910 --> 02:44:19.920 align:start position:0%
go do her stuff and I want to give the
 
02:44:22.190 --> 02:44:22.200 align:start position:0%
each of the caucuses a chance to talk a
 
02:44:24.349 --> 02:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
little bit before we uh leave the
 
02:44:28.190 --> 02:44:28.200 align:start position:0%
building so we'll hard stop at 4:15
 
02:44:30.550 --> 02:44:30.560 align:start position:0%
caucuses will will meet or not meet
 
02:44:33.750 --> 02:44:33.760 align:start position:0%
whatever they want to do and um and so
 
02:44:35.510 --> 02:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
the three things I want to do at this
 
02:44:39.870 --> 02:44:39.880 align:start position:0%
point is I want to bring up Mr weeders
 
02:44:44.030 --> 02:44:44.040 align:start position:0%
to uh have us uh hear what he has to say
 
02:44:46.830 --> 02:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
about uh the it
 
02:44:49.550 --> 02:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
implications on any of the effective
 
02:44:52.110 --> 02:44:52.120 align:start position:0%
dates of any of the bills that we've
 
02:44:54.950 --> 02:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
we've heard or will here still today
 
02:44:56.910 --> 02:44:56.920 align:start position:0%
which which the only one we haven't even
 
02:44:59.469 --> 02:44:59.479 align:start position:0%
mentioned yet is
 
02:45:04.870 --> 02:45:04.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:45:07.510 --> 02:45:07.520 align:start position:0%
ahead okay for the record Again David
 
02:45:10.309 --> 02:45:10.319 align:start position:0%
weers Information Services director
 
02:45:12.309 --> 02:45:12.319 align:start position:0%
DHHS uh as
 
02:45:15.630 --> 02:45:15.640 align:start position:0%
a chairman if you if I may
 
02:45:18.990 --> 02:45:19.000 align:start position:0%
1669 can I address the it components for
 
02:45:21.630 --> 02:45:21.640 align:start position:0%
that one yes this is you now have the
 
02:45:26.230 --> 02:45:26.240 align:start position:0%
floor okay so we we addressed all the
 
02:45:29.309 --> 02:45:29.319 align:start position:0%
bills with the exception of HB 1669 and
 
02:45:29.319 --> 02:45:31.030 align:start position:0%
bills with the exception of HB 1669 and
HB

02:45:31.030 --> 02:45:31.040 align:start position:0%
HB
 
02:45:34.150 --> 02:45:34.160 align:start position:0%
1588 um from what I can tell but if you
 
02:45:35.950 --> 02:45:35.960 align:start position:0%
need additional information let me know
 
02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:37.710 align:start position:0%
need additional information let me know
for

02:45:37.710 --> 02:45:37.720 align:start position:0%
for
 
02:45:41.230 --> 02:45:41.240 align:start position:0%
1669 we based off of the current fiscal
 
02:45:43.469 --> 02:45:43.479 align:start position:0%
note uh that you have in front of you
 
02:45:45.670 --> 02:45:45.680 align:start position:0%
that's posted we don't need additional
 
02:45:47.670 --> 02:45:47.680 align:start position:0%
funding um other than what's already
 
02:45:49.309 --> 02:45:49.319 align:start position:0%
listed there and we would be in
 
02:45:52.030 --> 02:45:52.040 align:start position:0%
compliance after 60 days of pass passage
 
02:45:54.870 --> 02:45:54.880 align:start position:0%
as it is written today the reason why is
 
02:45:57.190 --> 02:45:57.200 align:start position:0%
we currently do not share data with
 
02:45:59.230 --> 02:45:59.240 align:start position:0%
other states from the new New Hampshire
 
02:46:01.990 --> 02:46:02.000 align:start position:0%
immunization information system as of
 
02:46:05.070 --> 02:46:05.080 align:start position:0%
today we do plan on sharing data in the
 
02:46:07.389 --> 02:46:07.399 align:start position:0%
future and in order to do that with the
 
02:46:09.910 --> 02:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
changes in this bill we would need those
 
02:46:11.910 --> 02:46:11.920 align:start position:0%
the funding to do that changes those
 
02:46:14.150 --> 02:46:14.160 align:start position:0%
changes but we would not share any data
 
02:46:16.030 --> 02:46:16.040 align:start position:0%
until such time that the changes were
 
02:46:16.040 --> 02:46:18.630 align:start position:0%
until such time that the changes were
made

02:46:18.630 --> 02:46:18.640 align:start position:0%
made
 
02:46:22.429 --> 02:46:22.439 align:start position:0%
additionally okay so if this bill didn't
 
02:46:24.630 --> 02:46:24.640 align:start position:0%
get passed and we didn't give you money
 
02:46:27.950 --> 02:46:27.960 align:start position:0%
to change the system would that mean
 
02:46:30.830 --> 02:46:30.840 align:start position:0%
that by default we would not be sharing
 
02:46:33.790 --> 02:46:33.800 align:start position:0%
with other states or or or
 
02:46:35.870 --> 02:46:35.880 align:start position:0%
regions it would mean that we would be
 
02:46:38.269 --> 02:46:38.279 align:start position:0%
able to pass administrative rule to
 
02:46:40.870 --> 02:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
manage how we share data but it wouldn't
 
02:46:43.349 --> 02:46:43.359 align:start position:0%
necessarily mean we would comply with
 
02:46:46.190 --> 02:46:46.200 align:start position:0%
the letter of the bill bill as written
 
02:46:48.590 --> 02:46:48.600 align:start position:0%
so we would manage the administrative
 
02:46:51.429 --> 02:46:51.439 align:start position:0%
rule to share data with other states as
 
02:46:53.230 --> 02:46:53.240 align:start position:0%
other states do for immunization
 
02:46:56.070 --> 02:46:56.080 align:start position:0%
information system data um but the
 
02:46:59.670 --> 02:46:59.680 align:start position:0%
specifics in the bill um would not
 
02:47:01.630 --> 02:47:01.640 align:start position:0%
necessarily dictate how our
 
02:47:04.349 --> 02:47:04.359 align:start position:0%
administrative rule is written okay and
 
02:47:07.070 --> 02:47:07.080 align:start position:0%
and then if you could just remind me uh
 
02:47:10.349 --> 02:47:10.359 align:start position:0%
is is is this immunization system is
 
02:47:13.110 --> 02:47:13.120 align:start position:0%
this the anticipated answer to the
 
02:47:16.030 --> 02:47:16.040 align:start position:0%
question that's been coming up for a
 
02:47:18.469 --> 02:47:18.479 align:start position:0%
couple decades now about having an
 
02:47:21.309 --> 02:47:21.319 align:start position:0%
immunization registry is this is this
 
02:47:25.309 --> 02:47:25.319 align:start position:0%
the Longs sought solution to what has
 
02:47:26.750 --> 02:47:26.760 align:start position:0%
been an
 
02:47:29.469 --> 02:47:29.479 align:start position:0%
ongoing aspect of discussion in the
 
02:47:32.349 --> 02:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
legislature about having an immunization
 
02:47:35.469 --> 02:47:35.479 align:start position:0%
database and welcome tell us who you are
 
02:47:37.950 --> 02:47:37.960 align:start position:0%
so that we get you in the record hi
 
02:47:40.190 --> 02:47:40.200 align:start position:0%
chairman Abby Rogers legislative L on
 
02:47:41.590 --> 02:47:41.600 align:start position:0%
for the division of Public Health
 
02:47:44.309 --> 02:47:44.319 align:start position:0%
Services um I'm here to support with
 
02:47:45.990 --> 02:47:46.000 align:start position:0%
some information on the immunization
 
02:47:47.309 --> 02:47:47.319 align:start position:0%
from the immunization program if you
 
02:47:50.950 --> 02:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
have questions so um just to fill in
 
02:47:55.670 --> 02:47:55.680 align:start position:0%
that uh eventually um I's or information
 
02:47:57.990 --> 02:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
um immunization Registries do intend to
 
02:47:59.790 --> 02:47:59.800 align:start position:0%
share with other states that's sort of
 
02:48:01.990 --> 02:48:02.000 align:start position:0%
the best practice uh New Hampshire
 
02:48:04.750 --> 02:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
currently does not do that um and it is
 
02:48:06.309 --> 02:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
not a priority for the Department to
 
02:48:09.389 --> 02:48:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:48:12.309 --> 02:48:12.319 align:start position:0%
that are you familiar with the the
 
02:48:15.710 --> 02:48:15.720 align:start position:0%
ongoing discussion for about 10 15 20
 
02:48:18.590 --> 02:48:18.600 align:start position:0%
years about our desire to have an
 
02:48:21.230 --> 02:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
immunization database and we haven't had
 
02:48:25.030 --> 02:48:25.040 align:start position:0%
an IT base and so this is this comes
 
02:48:26.950 --> 02:48:26.960 align:start position:0%
back to my question to make sure that
 
02:48:30.110 --> 02:48:30.120 align:start position:0%
I'm in line with what I I think I'm
 
02:48:32.550 --> 02:48:32.560 align:start position:0%
talking about is is this the answer to
 
02:48:35.030 --> 02:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
the 20 year old question about us
 
02:48:37.269 --> 02:48:37.279 align:start position:0%
needing an immunization
 
02:48:40.230 --> 02:48:40.240 align:start position:0%
registry clearly imun immunization
 
02:48:42.590 --> 02:48:42.600 align:start position:0%
registry is is critically important it
 
02:48:45.990 --> 02:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
is is that a yes or a no well I'm I I'm
 
02:48:47.790 --> 02:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
not sure exactly what you're getting at
 
02:48:49.990 --> 02:48:50.000 align:start position:0%
if you could rephrase the question um
 
02:48:51.630 --> 02:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
the immunization registry is very
 
02:48:53.510 --> 02:48:53.520 align:start position:0%
important certainly um patient health
 
02:48:55.269 --> 02:48:55.279 align:start position:0%
records in the immunization registry
 
02:48:57.469 --> 02:48:57.479 align:start position:0%
sort of travel as they would like a PA a
 
02:48:59.750 --> 02:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
patient health record so if you uh went
 
02:49:02.349 --> 02:49:02.359 align:start position:0%
to college in New Hampshire for example
 
02:49:03.790 --> 02:49:03.800 align:start position:0%
you might want to have your and you move
 
02:49:05.590 --> 02:49:05.600 align:start position:0%
back to Maine you'd like to have your
 
02:49:07.389 --> 02:49:07.399 align:start position:0%
electronic records transferred um we
 
02:49:08.950 --> 02:49:08.960 align:start position:0%
currently don't do that I think
 
02:49:10.510 --> 02:49:10.520 align:start position:0%
immunization Registries are moving in
 
02:49:11.990 --> 02:49:12.000 align:start position:0%
that direction and I understand that
 
02:49:14.429 --> 02:49:14.439 align:start position:0%
this bill is an attempt to add um a
 
02:49:17.269 --> 02:49:17.279 align:start position:0%
waiver process in it you know if similar
 
02:49:18.510 --> 02:49:18.520 align:start position:0%
to the one that we have in New Hampshire
 
02:49:20.150 --> 02:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
which allows people to opt out of the
 
02:49:22.229 --> 02:49:22.239 align:start position:0%
registry or withdraw their
 
02:49:25.670 --> 02:49:25.680 align:start position:0%
information all right did you have a
 
02:49:29.110 --> 02:49:29.120 align:start position:0%
question thank you I did so your your
 
02:49:30.910 --> 02:49:30.920 align:start position:0%
timeliness on the answer regarding opt
 
02:49:35.790 --> 02:49:35.800 align:start position:0%
out is is profound or is aopo there was
 
02:49:38.830 --> 02:49:38.840 align:start position:0%
a desire to change from an opin database
 
02:49:40.830 --> 02:49:40.840 align:start position:0%
sorry an opt out database to an opt-in
 
02:49:42.870 --> 02:49:42.880 align:start position:0%
database do you have any information on
 
02:49:46.030 --> 02:49:46.040 align:start position:0%
where in the process that is sure um HB
 
02:49:48.469 --> 02:49:48.479 align:start position:0%
1606 which accomplished as sort of an
 
02:49:51.590 --> 02:49:51.600 align:start position:0%
opt-in opt out for the amation registry
 
02:49:54.110 --> 02:49:54.120 align:start position:0%
uh passed in 2022 and the department is
 
02:49:56.229 --> 02:49:56.239 align:start position:0%
in the final process of filing our rules
 
02:49:58.030 --> 02:49:58.040 align:start position:0%
based on H
 
02:50:00.990 --> 02:50:01.000 align:start position:0%
hp37 our final filing on those rules to
 
02:50:02.710 --> 02:50:02.720 align:start position:0%
update the legislation are going to be
 
02:50:04.110 --> 02:50:04.120 align:start position:0%
filed at the end of the month and we
 
02:50:05.830 --> 02:50:05.840 align:start position:0%
have uh reviewed those rules with
 
02:50:07.950 --> 02:50:07.960 align:start position:0%
representative Lon as well in
 
02:50:11.910 --> 02:50:11.920 align:start position:0%
January thank you followup so for those
 
02:50:14.269 --> 02:50:14.279 align:start position:0%
who were inadvertently swept into the
 
02:50:16.670 --> 02:50:16.680 align:start position:0%
data B the first time and don't want to
 
02:50:18.830 --> 02:50:18.840 align:start position:0%
participate what happens to that
 
02:50:21.910 --> 02:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
data so there are options to withdraw
 
02:50:24.110 --> 02:50:24.120 align:start position:0%
that data uh when the bill became
 
02:50:26.750 --> 02:50:26.760 align:start position:0%
effective in
 
02:50:30.070 --> 02:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
2022 um basically it's a pro prospective
 
02:50:33.030 --> 02:50:33.040 align:start position:0%
bill so moving forward is is the
 
02:50:34.670 --> 02:50:34.680 align:start position:0%
intended legislation as far as
 
02:50:38.190 --> 02:50:38.200 align:start position:0%
withdrawal but and withdrawal um is is
 
02:50:40.429 --> 02:50:40.439 align:start position:0%
certainly a an option for anybody's data
 
02:50:42.710 --> 02:50:42.720 align:start position:0%
who was entered in without the ability
 
02:50:45.070 --> 02:50:45.080 align:start position:0%
to opt out during emergency order 19 I
 
02:50:48.870 --> 02:50:48.880 align:start position:0%
believe it was okay one more followup so
 
02:50:50.990 --> 02:50:51.000 align:start position:0%
what happens someone says they withdraw
 
02:50:53.990 --> 02:50:54.000 align:start position:0%
from the database is their name there
 
02:50:56.389 --> 02:50:56.399 align:start position:0%
and it just says withdrawn what what
 
02:50:58.309 --> 02:50:58.319 align:start position:0%
information is Left Behind is residual
 
02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
or is it completely deleted and they are
 
02:51:02.630 --> 02:51:02.640 align:start position:0%
no longer tracked whatsoever okay so the
 
02:51:04.190 --> 02:51:04.200 align:start position:0%
best that I can answer that question is
 
02:51:05.790 --> 02:51:05.800 align:start position:0%
I don't work for the immunization
 
02:51:07.990 --> 02:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
program but I know that the department
 
02:51:10.870 --> 02:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
um as a provider for the immunizations
 
02:51:13.790 --> 02:51:13.800 align:start position:0%
during the um state of emergency under
 
02:51:16.389 --> 02:51:16.399 align:start position:0%
Hippa are have to keep information for
 
02:51:18.950 --> 02:51:18.960 align:start position:0%
seven years as a provider so my
 
02:51:20.110 --> 02:51:20.120 align:start position:0%
understanding that that information is
 
02:51:22.150 --> 02:51:22.160 align:start position:0%
taken out of the registry and is held in
 
02:51:24.950 --> 02:51:24.960 align:start position:0%
a complet uh um hipa compliant area
 
02:51:27.269 --> 02:51:27.279 align:start position:0%
paper files um until that seven years is
 
02:51:29.190 --> 02:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
up and then those records are no longer
 
02:51:32.150 --> 02:51:32.160 align:start position:0%
with the Department okay thank you thank
 
02:51:35.750 --> 02:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
you so representative Leon did did did
 
02:51:38.630 --> 02:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
did we get the amendment from OS um we
 
02:51:40.070 --> 02:51:40.080 align:start position:0%
don't have an official Amendment but I
 
02:51:41.710 --> 02:51:41.720 align:start position:0%
have the language that I sent so I can
 
02:51:43.150 --> 02:51:43.160 align:start position:0%
give that to you guys so we can take a
 
02:51:45.349 --> 02:51:45.359 align:start position:0%
look and see I i' i' rather just wait
 
02:51:49.389 --> 02:51:49.399 align:start position:0%
and distribute what o OS gives us so so
 
02:51:51.550 --> 02:51:51.560 align:start position:0%
we can probably just anticipate
 
02:51:51.560 --> 02:51:52.710 align:start position:0%
we can probably just anticipate
deferring

02:51:52.710 --> 02:51:52.720 align:start position:0%
deferring
 
02:51:57.229 --> 02:51:57.239 align:start position:0%
1669 for full action next week um yes I
 
02:51:59.190 --> 02:51:59.200 align:start position:0%
my question the point of the amendment
 
02:52:00.710 --> 02:52:00.720 align:start position:0%
was to instead of saying that the
 
02:52:02.790 --> 02:52:02.800 align:start position:0%
department shall not share it would be
 
02:52:04.670 --> 02:52:04.680 align:start position:0%
simply to state that prior to entering
 
02:52:06.790 --> 02:52:06.800 align:start position:0%
into an agreement to share it then the
 
02:52:08.429 --> 02:52:08.439 align:start position:0%
department would need to follow the
 
02:52:11.070 --> 02:52:11.080 align:start position:0%
these procedures that way we're not
 
02:52:13.070 --> 02:52:13.080 align:start position:0%
burdening the budget this year with the
 
02:52:15.269 --> 02:52:15.279 align:start position:0%
need to do this and build bu up this
 
02:52:17.269 --> 02:52:17.279 align:start position:0%
this infrastructure when we're not
 
02:52:19.030 --> 02:52:19.040 align:start position:0%
certain as to when they would actually
 
02:52:20.710 --> 02:52:20.720 align:start position:0%
look to share this information given
 
02:52:22.750 --> 02:52:22.760 align:start position:0%
that it's not a department
 
02:52:24.670 --> 02:52:24.680 align:start position:0%
priority so I don't know if that would
 
02:52:27.110 --> 02:52:27.120 align:start position:0%
change the it requirements if it said
 
02:52:29.349 --> 02:52:29.359 align:start position:0%
that um said that prior to entering into
 
02:52:31.110 --> 02:52:31.120 align:start position:0%
an agreement you need to make sure that
 
02:52:32.830 --> 02:52:32.840 align:start position:0%
you will be able to actually follow the
 
02:52:36.750 --> 02:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
withdrawals and um that are allowed um
 
02:52:39.309 --> 02:52:39.319 align:start position:0%
basically basically saying that it that
 
02:52:40.550 --> 02:52:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh you won't share it until you're going
 
02:52:42.750 --> 02:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
to follow existing state law would that
 
02:52:44.910 --> 02:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
change what the it requirements would be
 
02:52:48.309 --> 02:52:48.319 align:start position:0%
for this bill and the fiscal
 
02:52:51.389 --> 02:52:51.399 align:start position:0%
note yes essentially that would make
 
02:52:53.150 --> 02:52:53.160 align:start position:0%
make it so that the it requirements
 
02:52:55.229 --> 02:52:55.239 align:start position:0%
would be outside of the bill we would
 
02:52:57.790 --> 02:52:57.800 align:start position:0%
still need to change the system and
 
02:52:59.950 --> 02:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
incur costs it just wouldn't be
 
02:53:02.630 --> 02:53:02.640 align:start position:0%
associated with the bill at this point
 
02:53:05.150 --> 02:53:05.160 align:start position:0%
as a followup um so as a followup that
 
02:53:06.870 --> 02:53:06.880 align:start position:0%
actually would just be capturing some of
 
02:53:09.229 --> 02:53:09.239 align:start position:0%
the cost that came with um with the
 
02:53:11.429 --> 02:53:11.439 align:start position:0%
previous House Bill 16006 within the
 
02:53:13.550 --> 02:53:13.560 align:start position:0%
withdrawal that it NE wasn't necessarily
 
02:53:15.590 --> 02:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
handled within the build out of the IIs
 
02:53:16.910 --> 02:53:16.920 align:start position:0%
that you'd be able to withdraw that
 
02:53:19.030 --> 02:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
information not just within the state
 
02:53:19.570 --> 02:53:19.580 align:start position:0%
but from the
 
02:53:19.580 --> 02:53:21.150 align:start position:0%
but from the
[Music]

02:53:21.150 --> 02:53:21.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:53:24.309 --> 02:53:24.319 align:start position:0%
IIs um the so the best I can answer on
 
02:53:26.590 --> 02:53:26.600 align:start position:0%
that is there are um I believe it's a
 
02:53:28.550 --> 02:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
very delicate system it's very U there's
 
02:53:30.750 --> 02:53:30.760 align:start position:0%
a lot of tech technology upgrades and
 
02:53:32.229 --> 02:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
testing and implementation ongoing
 
02:53:35.070 --> 02:53:35.080 align:start position:0%
maintenance so referencing in the bill
 
02:53:36.750 --> 02:53:36.760 align:start position:0%
as opposed to I mean the bill is amended
 
02:53:40.269 --> 02:53:40.279 align:start position:0%
still did require 6080 $80,000 sort of
 
02:53:42.510 --> 02:53:42.520 align:start position:0%
enhancement I could we could get back to
 
02:53:44.070 --> 02:53:44.080 align:start position:0%
you probably on on how the amendment
 
02:53:45.190 --> 02:53:45.200 align:start position:0%
might change change that but I I can
 
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
speak that that I can imagine that it
 
02:53:49.229 --> 02:53:49.239 align:start position:0%
may need uh once you do Implement um
 
02:53:51.150 --> 02:53:51.160 align:start position:0%
data sharing with States you will you
 
02:53:54.269 --> 02:53:54.279 align:start position:0%
will incur the cost sorry and then one
 
02:53:56.429 --> 02:53:56.439 align:start position:0%
last followup do you need statutory
 
02:53:58.309 --> 02:53:58.319 align:start position:0%
authorization to share that in enter
 
02:53:59.790 --> 02:53:59.800 align:start position:0%
into those contracts to share that
 
02:54:02.030 --> 02:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
information with other states or is that
 
02:54:04.349 --> 02:54:04.359 align:start position:0%
something that is if if you could let me
 
02:54:06.349 --> 02:54:06.359 align:start position:0%
know where that's delegated to allow the
 
02:54:07.830 --> 02:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
department to share that information
 
02:54:10.030 --> 02:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
without um coming to the legislature I'd
 
02:54:12.030 --> 02:54:12.040 align:start position:0%
be very interested in that sure I I
 
02:54:13.710 --> 02:54:13.720 align:start position:0%
believe that a lot of our contractual
 
02:54:16.150 --> 02:54:16.160 align:start position:0%
data sharing is through anou or Ana but
 
02:54:17.389 --> 02:54:17.399 align:start position:0%
I can certainly get back to you on that
 
02:54:18.990 --> 02:54:19.000 align:start position:0%
information thank
 
02:54:22.389 --> 02:54:22.399 align:start position:0%
youou so so Mr weers I I I stopped you
 
02:54:24.910 --> 02:54:24.920 align:start position:0%
as you were rolling out your your longer
 
02:54:28.630 --> 02:54:28.640 align:start position:0%
answer uh and if you could just focus on
 
02:54:31.870 --> 02:54:31.880 align:start position:0%
um based on your analysis uh are there
 
02:54:33.910 --> 02:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
any other bills that we should be
 
02:54:37.070 --> 02:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
changing effective dates to so that you
 
02:54:39.269 --> 02:54:39.279 align:start position:0%
can fully implement the system and
 
02:54:42.070 --> 02:54:42.080 align:start position:0%
support the the policy or are there any
 
02:54:44.110 --> 02:54:44.120 align:start position:0%
changes to the dollar estimates if you
 
02:54:46.710 --> 02:54:46.720 align:start position:0%
could could just focus us on yes there
 
02:54:49.590 --> 02:54:49.600 align:start position:0%
are changes or no there aren't
 
02:54:53.510 --> 02:54:53.520 align:start position:0%
changes sir certainly Mr chair um thank
 
02:54:55.710 --> 02:54:55.720 align:start position:0%
you um the only other one would be HB
 
02:54:58.590 --> 02:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
1588 we would have a request for a
 
02:55:01.870 --> 02:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
change for effective date um as a result
 
02:55:05.670 --> 02:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:55:08.469 --> 02:55:08.479 align:start position:0%
system go go ahead and tell tell us what
 
02:55:10.150 --> 02:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
the that is it's probably in your write
 
02:55:14.269 --> 02:55:14.279 align:start position:0%
up but so for for HB 1588 in order for
 
02:55:16.389 --> 02:55:16.399 align:start position:0%
for the Department to be able to make
 
02:55:19.429 --> 02:55:19.439 align:start position:0%
the changes effectively we would need um
 
02:55:22.110 --> 02:55:22.120 align:start position:0%
an effective date of July 1st 2025 in
 
02:55:23.750 --> 02:55:23.760 align:start position:0%
order to go through the contract
 
02:55:26.710 --> 02:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
Amendment Contracting process yeah and
 
02:55:28.590 --> 02:55:28.600 align:start position:0%
do the design development and
 
02:55:30.630 --> 02:55:30.640 align:start position:0%
implementation associated with
 
02:55:34.550 --> 02:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
it okay so so that change in the date
 
02:55:37.429 --> 02:55:37.439 align:start position:0%
doesn't change your your your financial
 
02:55:39.990 --> 02:55:40.000 align:start position:0%
need no it does not all
 
02:55:43.630 --> 02:55:43.640 align:start position:0%
right anything else on the it area that
 
02:55:47.830 --> 02:55:47.840 align:start position:0%
is all I have have today okay um I hey I
 
02:55:49.750 --> 02:55:49.760 align:start position:0%
appreciate the extra work you put in on
 
02:55:52.190 --> 02:55:52.200 align:start position:0%
this and uh and coming back and sitting
 
02:55:54.150 --> 02:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
here for so long today thank you for the
 
02:55:56.229 --> 02:55:56.239 align:start position:0%
opportunity are there any it questions
 
02:55:58.190 --> 02:55:58.200 align:start position:0%
go ahead um I just wanted to say that
 
02:55:59.790 --> 02:55:59.800 align:start position:0%
the actual amendment is up there I'll
 
02:56:01.309 --> 02:56:01.319 align:start position:0%
grab the printed copy just so that
 
02:56:03.389 --> 02:56:03.399 align:start position:0%
people have something to work to before
 
02:56:05.309 --> 02:56:05.319 align:start position:0%
you um come back to
 
02:56:07.750 --> 02:56:07.760 align:start position:0%
1669 should step out okay or we could
 
02:56:10.550 --> 02:56:10.560 align:start position:0%
just email it later you know because I
 
02:56:12.229 --> 02:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
don't think think we have time to deal
 
02:56:15.229 --> 02:56:15.239 align:start position:0%
with it today so it's not time sensitive
 
02:56:18.469 --> 02:56:18.479 align:start position:0%
but thank you okay thank you thank you
 
02:56:24.309 --> 02:56:24.319 align:start position:0%
so much so um so I effectively uh ended
 
02:56:27.349 --> 02:56:27.359 align:start position:0%
1669 for today and we're going to go
 
02:56:30.349 --> 02:56:30.359 align:start position:0%
ahead and probably try to wrap it up
 
02:56:31.910 --> 02:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
Monday with the
 
02:56:35.710 --> 02:56:35.720 align:start position:0%
amendment um and then the last one that
 
02:56:38.229 --> 02:56:38.239 align:start position:0%
we have to talk about is
 
02:56:41.389 --> 02:56:41.399 align:start position:0%
1588 relative to court jurisdiction over
 
02:56:44.830 --> 02:56:44.840 align:start position:0%
persons receiving special education
 
02:56:47.030 --> 02:56:47.040 align:start position:0%
have we ground everyone down is is there
 
02:56:48.750 --> 02:56:48.760 align:start position:0%
anyone in the audience that wants to
 
02:56:52.389 --> 02:56:52.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:56:55.950 --> 02:56:55.960 align:start position:0%
1588 are there is there anyone in
 
02:56:58.630 --> 02:56:58.640 align:start position:0%
division three what what what was our
 
02:57:02.670 --> 02:57:02.680 align:start position:0%
issue here my notes say this needed two
 
02:57:07.269 --> 02:57:07.279 align:start position:0%
um two two or three additional DHHS
 
02:57:10.870 --> 02:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
employees it assumes 32 new clients and
 
02:57:12.870 --> 02:57:12.880 align:start position:0%
somebody emailed us saying it's probably
 
02:57:14.910 --> 02:57:14.920 align:start position:0%
really 22
 
02:57:16.870 --> 02:57:16.880 align:start position:0%
and then the fiscal note was rather
 
02:57:21.070 --> 02:57:21.080 align:start position:0%
broad from 1.65 million to
 
02:57:25.469 --> 02:57:25.479 align:start position:0%
5.76 million and so Mr White if you if
 
02:57:29.229 --> 02:57:29.239 align:start position:0%
you could tell us what you think about
 
02:57:32.870 --> 02:57:32.880 align:start position:0%
the clientele number and and if the
 
02:57:36.110 --> 02:57:36.120 align:start position:0%
range on the fiscal note is any tighter
 
02:57:40.150 --> 02:57:40.160 align:start position:0%
than you thought sure um so I am not as
 
02:57:42.750 --> 02:57:42.760 align:start position:0%
well versed on the specific population
 
02:57:47.910 --> 02:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
but in the fiscal note um as introduced
 
02:57:49.550 --> 02:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
uh dated
 
02:57:53.469 --> 02:57:53.479 align:start position:0%
12223 if you turn to the second page of
 
02:57:57.550 --> 02:57:57.560 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note um you will see the
 
02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:00.479 align:start position:0%
range um that the chair is referencing
 
02:58:03.950 --> 02:58:03.960 align:start position:0%
there and we're assuming that because
 
02:58:06.150 --> 02:58:06.160 align:start position:0%
we're expanding the eligibility by a
 
02:58:08.630 --> 02:58:08.640 align:start position:0%
year we would see an increase in the
 
02:58:11.630 --> 02:58:11.640 align:start position:0%
total population and as a result of that
 
02:58:14.870 --> 02:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
we would probably see um the range
 
02:58:17.309 --> 02:58:17.319 align:start position:0%
potentially the ranges of residential
 
02:58:19.830 --> 02:58:19.840 align:start position:0%
care foster care Community Based
 
02:58:23.510 --> 02:58:23.520 align:start position:0%
Services um W within some reasonable
 
02:58:25.590 --> 02:58:25.600 align:start position:0%
degree and so you'll see there for State
 
02:58:28.389 --> 02:58:28.399 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 25 for residential a low of
 
02:58:33.469 --> 02:58:33.479 align:start position:0%
9915 a high of $915,000 a high of $4
 
02:58:36.510 --> 02:58:36.520 align:start position:0%
million um we also have a few additional
 
02:58:38.429 --> 02:58:38.439 align:start position:0%
position costs related to child
 
02:58:40.830 --> 02:58:40.840 align:start position:0%
protective Ser two child protective
 
02:58:44.190 --> 02:58:44.200 align:start position:0%
service workers and one jppo position
 
02:58:45.550 --> 02:58:45.560 align:start position:0%
because we're assuming if we're
 
02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:47.560 align:start position:0%
expanding the population we're going to
 
02:58:50.630 --> 02:58:50.640 align:start position:0%
have some additional case load impact
 
02:58:52.469 --> 02:58:52.479 align:start position:0%
going forward uh which is why we
 
02:58:54.349 --> 02:58:54.359 align:start position:0%
included those those three position
 
02:58:57.070 --> 02:58:57.080 align:start position:0%
costs there as well um similar to the
 
02:58:58.910 --> 02:58:58.920 align:start position:0%
last bill there's a lot of variables
 
02:59:00.710 --> 02:59:00.720 align:start position:0%
here we don't necessarily know who's
 
02:59:03.110 --> 02:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
going to age into the system but we know
 
02:59:04.590 --> 02:59:04.600 align:start position:0%
that there'll be some impact so we
 
02:59:08.150 --> 02:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
basically just straight lined linear um
 
02:59:11.070 --> 02:59:11.080 align:start position:0%
the the the the cost for this year into
 
02:59:12.830 --> 02:59:12.840 align:start position:0%
the years
 
02:59:12.840 --> 02:59:14.349 align:start position:0%
the years
forward

02:59:14.349 --> 02:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
forward
 
02:59:17.229 --> 02:59:17.239 align:start position:0%
thank you question um yes thank you Mr
 
02:59:19.590 --> 02:59:19.600 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you um does this bill
 
02:59:21.990 --> 02:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
essentially move the costs that are
 
02:59:24.229 --> 02:59:24.239 align:start position:0%
currently under local school boards and
 
02:59:26.309 --> 02:59:26.319 align:start position:0%
local taxpayers into the department when
 
02:59:28.190 --> 02:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
you look at this residential or am I
 
02:59:31.389 --> 02:59:31.399 align:start position:0%
completely misunderstanding
 
02:59:35.590 --> 02:59:35.600 align:start position:0%
this so there are situations in in which
 
02:59:38.309 --> 02:59:38.319 align:start position:0%
the Lea will pay for residential but I
 
02:59:41.150 --> 02:59:41.160 align:start position:0%
think that's specific to the educational
 
02:59:44.349 --> 02:59:44.359 align:start position:0%
component um but then there are cases
 
02:59:47.910 --> 02:59:47.920 align:start position:0%
uh where children are either in u under
 
02:59:51.070 --> 02:59:51.080 align:start position:0%
Child Protection or uh coming through
 
02:59:53.510 --> 02:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
the uh division for um Bureau for mental
 
02:59:55.950 --> 02:59:55.960 align:start position:0%
health where where those children are
 
02:59:57.910 --> 02:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
being placed into residential treatment
 
03:00:00.150 --> 03:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
facilities so you can you will have
 
03:00:01.429 --> 03:00:01.439 align:start position:0%
children at residential treatment
 
03:00:04.469 --> 03:00:04.479 align:start position:0%
facilities potentially being um paid for
 
03:00:06.790 --> 03:00:06.800 align:start position:0%
by the state or an Lea depending on on
 
03:00:09.030 --> 03:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
the particular situation um so if this
 
03:00:12.349 --> 03:00:12.359 align:start position:0%
doesn't pass who pays for the $4 million
 
03:00:14.670 --> 03:00:14.680 align:start position:0%
or or whatever the fiscal no is here
 
03:00:16.030 --> 03:00:16.040 align:start position:0%
because these kids are these kids being
 
03:00:18.590 --> 03:00:18.600 align:start position:0%
denied services or right now or are they
 
03:00:21.389 --> 03:00:21.399 align:start position:0%
being paid by somebody else so so so
 
03:00:25.070 --> 03:00:25.080 align:start position:0%
this is extending um the eligibility age
 
03:00:28.990 --> 03:00:29.000 align:start position:0%
from 21 to 22 so so so we're expanding
 
03:00:30.750 --> 03:00:30.760 align:start position:0%
the population so if this doesn't pass
 
03:00:32.990 --> 03:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
there's no new cost if it does this is
 
03:00:35.710 --> 03:00:35.720 align:start position:0%
the estimated range sorry and and the
 
03:00:38.110 --> 03:00:38.120 align:start position:0%
last followup is we increase the age for
 
03:00:41.030 --> 03:00:41.040 align:start position:0%
special education in the schools to 22
 
03:00:44.469 --> 03:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
from 21 so the previous 21 years of age
 
03:00:47.590 --> 03:00:47.600 align:start position:0%
in this would have been a consistent age
 
03:00:50.030 --> 03:00:50.040 align:start position:0%
with the um with the educational
 
03:00:51.870 --> 03:00:51.880 align:start position:0%
requirements for special education and
 
03:00:54.349 --> 03:00:54.359 align:start position:0%
for these payments right now is there a
 
03:00:56.630 --> 03:00:56.640 align:start position:0%
Gap where there there are students who
 
03:00:59.070 --> 03:00:59.080 align:start position:0%
are paid by the department except for
 
03:01:01.389 --> 03:01:01.399 align:start position:0%
that year from 21 to 22 when it bounces
 
03:01:03.630 --> 03:01:03.640 align:start position:0%
back to local taxpayers because I know
 
03:01:06.190 --> 03:01:06.200 align:start position:0%
in my town we had a significant jump in
 
03:01:09.229 --> 03:01:09.239 align:start position:0%
costs in from that increase from age 21
 
03:01:09.239 --> 03:01:10.550 align:start position:0%
costs in from that increase from age 21
to

03:01:10.550 --> 03:01:10.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:01:14.349 --> 03:01:14.359 align:start position:0%
22 I I'm not as familiar um with with
 
03:01:15.870 --> 03:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
that discussion I'd have to go back and
 
03:01:18.229 --> 03:01:18.239 align:start position:0%
get an answer for you that would be
 
03:01:19.990 --> 03:01:20.000 align:start position:0%
really helpful to understand what what's
 
03:01:22.910 --> 03:01:22.920 align:start position:0%
happened to this uh change from 21 to 22
 
03:01:24.910 --> 03:01:24.920 align:start position:0%
who's paying now and if that makes sense
 
03:01:26.429 --> 03:01:26.439 align:start position:0%
to move it to the department even if it
 
03:01:31.070 --> 03:01:31.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:01:34.830 --> 03:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
budgeted thank you any other questions
 
03:01:37.910 --> 03:01:37.920 align:start position:0%
for Mr Wier on this bill from division
 
03:01:40.110 --> 03:01:40.120 align:start position:0%
three I have I have a question for you
 
03:01:42.750 --> 03:01:42.760 align:start position:0%
Mr Ripple could could you go ahead and
 
03:01:44.510 --> 03:01:44.520 align:start position:0%
get an amendment on on this to change
 
03:01:46.510 --> 03:01:46.520 align:start position:0%
the effective
 
03:01:49.429 --> 03:01:49.439 align:start position:0%
date sure yes so that would be to July
 
03:01:49.439 --> 03:01:50.429 align:start position:0%
date sure yes so that would be to July
1st

03:01:50.429 --> 03:01:50.439 align:start position:0%
1st
 
03:01:54.150 --> 03:01:54.160 align:start position:0%
2025 yes sir okay
 
03:01:58.070 --> 03:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
yep okay all right so I'm hoping that'll
 
03:02:01.110 --> 03:02:01.120 align:start position:0%
be ready to exact next time we get
 
03:02:04.790 --> 03:02:04.800 align:start position:0%
together uh any other questions uh I'm
 
03:02:06.870 --> 03:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
going to if not I'm going to go ahead
 
03:02:09.790 --> 03:02:09.800 align:start position:0%
and conclude uh the hearing on
 
03:02:13.990 --> 03:02:14.000 align:start position:0%
1588 and then uh just some some closing
 
03:02:18.110 --> 03:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
remarks uh thank you Mr White um okay so
 
03:02:20.710 --> 03:02:20.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to meet again in as division
 
03:02:24.349 --> 03:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
three Monday afternoon uh we've been
 
03:02:28.590 --> 03:02:28.600 align:start position:0%
starting at 1:00 and uh today I I I sort
 
03:02:31.590 --> 03:02:31.600 align:start position:0%
of felt like um if we were trying to
 
03:02:34.229 --> 03:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
exec some of these things and still had
 
03:02:36.309 --> 03:02:36.319 align:start position:0%
open hearings on some of these things
 
03:02:38.910 --> 03:02:38.920 align:start position:0%
that we don't quite have enough time
 
03:02:42.030 --> 03:02:42.040 align:start position:0%
from 1 to 4:30 and that may be because I
 
03:02:44.389 --> 03:02:44.399 align:start position:0%
I talk too much or just go go so slow I
 
03:02:46.309 --> 03:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
think it's CU these are complex issues
 
03:02:50.590 --> 03:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
but um so is is there anyone who would
 
03:02:55.349 --> 03:02:55.359 align:start position:0%
have a heartburn starting at noon
 
03:02:58.429 --> 03:02:58.439 align:start position:0%
Monday just come fed and we'll take a
 
03:03:01.229 --> 03:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
potty break instead of just forcing

03:03:07.870 --> 03:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
