00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 align:start position:0%
good morning
 
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
afternoon it is 2:30 I'm going to open
 
00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.150 align:start position:0%
afternoon it is 2:30 I'm going to open
the

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 align:start position:0%
subcommittee hearing for House Bill 1025
 
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 align:start position:0%
relative to disorderly
 
00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 align:start position:0%
conduct and are are you here for for
 
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.910 align:start position:0%
conduct and are are you here for for
this

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239 align:start position:0%
bill well we don't have the sponsor it
 
00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like any anybody else is
 
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 align:start position:0%
here did you have something you would
 
00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 align:start position:0%
like to to say about the bill we're
 
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 align:start position:0%
sharing so my question with this is um
 
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 align:start position:0%
the bill reab repeals the prohibition
 
00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 align:start position:0%
against directing at another person in
 
00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 align:start position:0%
public place of seen derisive or
 
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 align:start position:0%
offensive words which are likely to
 
00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 align:start position:0%
provoke a violent reaction so if
 
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 align:start position:0%
somebody says something in somebody's
 
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 align:start position:0%
face and somebody punches him in the
 
00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 align:start position:0%
face is that person then remove uh held
 
00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 align:start position:0%
you know they're free too to punch the
 
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 align:start position:0%
person in the face so if somebody's
 
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
going to say OB seen awful things to
 
00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 align:start position:0%
somebody and they punch him in the face
 
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
I think fair is
 
00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 align:start position:0%
fair is well EXC I'm sorry I'm sorry
 
00:01:56.029 --> 00:01:56.039 align:start position:0%
voting the other person yeah but she
 
00:01:58.029 --> 00:01:58.039 align:start position:0%
sent an email and said she wasn't coming
 
00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
oh she did so
 
00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 align:start position:0%
um representative Reed
 
00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 align:start position:0%
I I don't know exactly the answer to
 
00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 align:start position:0%
what you're saying so if I'm going to
 
00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800 align:start position:0%
give an
 
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 align:start position:0%
example and this did this did not
 
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 align:start position:0%
necessarily it did not become an an
 
00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 align:start position:0%
actual physical fight actually nothing
 
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
happened there were no words actually
 
00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
exchanged but um there's a video
 
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 align:start position:0%
and it
 
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 align:start position:0%
was it's it's been like two years and it
 
00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879 align:start position:0%
was in DC okay and there's a video where
 
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 align:start position:0%
there was a group of people that left an
 
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 align:start position:0%
event and there was a large group of
 
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 align:start position:0%
people that in my humble opinion if
 
00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
you'd watch the video I I think it'd be
 
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
quite evident that there was a lot of
 
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
harassing going on of the group that
 
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
left this event so people were you know
 
00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 align:start position:0%
they had signs they had banners and they
 
00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:57.560 align:start position:0%
were very much in the person's face as
 
00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 align:start position:0%
the person was walking so as the person
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
person was just walking down the street
 
00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 align:start position:0%
minding their own business trying to get
 
00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:04.640 align:start position:0%
to the hotel there was a group of people
 
00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
and the the group of people were jumping
 
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
back and forth in front of these this
 
00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 align:start position:0%
these couple of people so basically when
 
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 align:start position:0%
people left the event they left in
 
00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:16.159 align:start position:0%
staggered groups so some you know there
 
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 align:start position:0%
might have been two or three people in a
 
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 align:start position:0%
group there might have been four or five
 
00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 align:start position:0%
people in the group but this particular
 
00:03:21.589 --> 00:03:21.599 align:start position:0%
was only two people and there was an
 
00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 align:start position:0%
entire crowd of people and they were
 
00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:26.519 align:start position:0%
literally jumping back and forth and
 
00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 align:start position:0%
they were screaming in their faces
 
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:30.200 align:start position:0%
asking them this question
 
00:03:31.509 --> 00:03:31.519 align:start position:0%
and they just kept on repeating the
 
00:03:34.589 --> 00:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
question over and over and over
 
00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 align:start position:0%
um I I kept on looking at that and
 
00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 align:start position:0%
saying that that that per person is
 
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
clearly antagonizing they're clearly
 
00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 align:start position:0%
provoking the reaction that they wanted
 
00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 align:start position:0%
in my opinion was probably to fight um I
 
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 align:start position:0%
think that they wanted the person they
 
00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 align:start position:0%
were provoking to
 
00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 align:start position:0%
to be physical with them right to
 
00:03:57.589 --> 00:03:57.599 align:start position:0%
actually reach out and do something
 
00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
because then they could have said oh
 
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 align:start position:0%
look they punched me and I didn't even
 
00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:03.879 align:start position:0%
do anything right um and sometimes we
 
00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
see that like we see that you know here
 
00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 align:start position:0%
you're allowed to record people um but
 
00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
when a person takes uh you know a selfie
 
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 align:start position:0%
stick and literally you know does this
 
00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 align:start position:0%
to you that isn't T agonizing and it's
 
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
and it's incredibly rude just because
 
00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
it's illegal doesn't mean that it's not
 
00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 align:start position:0%
rude right but does it give you the
 
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 align:start position:0%
right to punch the person in the face
 
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 align:start position:0%
probably not you know not actually it
 
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't give you the right to punch them
 
00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 align:start position:0%
in the face so I I don't exactly know
 
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 align:start position:0%
what the the sponsor's intent is um when
 
00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 align:start position:0%
he was here the only thing I remember
 
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.440 align:start position:0%
him saying was you know if I want to
 
00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 align:start position:0%
say you know you are this or this or
 
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 align:start position:0%
this if I'm and out in public I want to
 
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
be able to have the right to say that I
 
00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 align:start position:0%
think you're allowed to say that
 
00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
regardless I just don't think that it
 
00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 align:start position:0%
means the person can punch you in the
 
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:53.360 align:start position:0%
face um yeah my my initial uh impression
 
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 align:start position:0%
when I read this was that it was for the
 
00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:57.759 align:start position:0%
peaceful protesters like you said who
 
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:01.280 align:start position:0%
choose to get inside the opposition's
 
00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 align:start position:0%
bubble and scream at them and yell at
 
00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:05.919 align:start position:0%
them and harass them and they don't want
 
00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
to be accountable for those actions they
 
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 align:start position:0%
want a a free ride to just do that we
 
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 align:start position:0%
are our free speech is protected we have
 
00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 align:start position:0%
the right to Peaceful assembly but we do
 
00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:18.360 align:start position:0%
not have the right to harass people and
 
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 align:start position:0%
get in their face and their bubble um
 
00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:23.160 align:start position:0%
the only way I think I would support
 
00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 align:start position:0%
this is if on the other side could
 
00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:28.639 align:start position:0%
retaliate without any kind of um
 
00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
consequence so if if they choose to
 
00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:35.160 align:start position:0%
harass and intimidate somebody then
 
00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 align:start position:0%
whatever reaction it drew from the other
 
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 align:start position:0%
side should be equally acceptable within
 
00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 align:start position:0%
reason well I hear what you're saying I
 
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:49.840 align:start position:0%
don't so the example that I gave
 
00:05:53.309 --> 00:05:53.319 align:start position:0%
you what the people that were doing the
 
00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:54.880 align:start position:0%
antagonizing you know what they were
 
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 align:start position:0%
doing was considered perfectly legal I
 
00:05:58.309 --> 00:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
don't think it should have been to be
 
00:06:00.469 --> 00:06:00.479 align:start position:0%
honest with you they they were very much
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
in my opinion provoking um but at the
 
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
end of the day there was you know it was
 
00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
essentially ignored
 
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:14.360 align:start position:0%
but I just I you know so I have the book
 
00:06:17.589 --> 00:06:17.599 align:start position:0%
right and so the question is if you take
 
00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
out that
 
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.400 align:start position:0%
section then everything else is still
 
00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:24.199 align:start position:0%
kind of in there so how would it all you
 
00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 align:start position:0%
know how would it all come together so
 
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:31.280 align:start position:0%
so B which is what he has here RSA
 
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 align:start position:0%
6442 and then B which is right here it
 
00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 align:start position:0%
says directs it another person a public
 
00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
place OB
 
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.629 align:start position:0%
place OB
seen

00:06:41.629 --> 00:06:41.639 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:06:44.749 --> 00:06:44.759 align:start position:0%
divisive divisive or offensive words
 
00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:46.280 align:start position:0%
which are likely to provoke a violent
 
00:06:48.749 --> 00:06:48.759 align:start position:0%
reaction on the part of an ordinary
 
00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 align:start position:0%
person or so if you take out that then
 
00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:56.199 align:start position:0%
you would just go from a right to C
 
00:06:58.909 --> 00:06:58.919 align:start position:0%
right so a reads engages in fighting or
 
00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:00.759 align:start position:0%
in violent
 
00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:02.599 align:start position:0%
termales or threatening behavior in a
 
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:05.280 align:start position:0%
public place or to be would taken out
 
00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
we'd go to C obstructs vehicular or
 
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:10.120 align:start position:0%
pedest pedestrian traffic on any public
 
00:07:11.629 --> 00:07:11.639 align:start position:0%
Street or sidewalk or the entrance any
 
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:13.360 align:start position:0%
other building whatever whatever so
 
00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
basically what they're saying is
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%
everything else would still be okay to
 
00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:19.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:23.189 --> 00:07:23.199 align:start position:0%
you except you would be allowed
 
00:07:27.029 --> 00:07:27.039 align:start position:0%
to say offensive words I
 
00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:29.560 align:start position:0%
mean I don't know I don't first of you
 
00:07:31.749 --> 00:07:31.759 align:start position:0%
can't legislate someone's feelings
 
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:34.240 align:start position:0%
exactly this is already in here um and
 
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:36.120 align:start position:0%
and I'll give an example which I shared
 
00:07:38.710 --> 00:07:38.720 align:start position:0%
with um Terry that happened in nashille
 
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
and this was just two months ago where
 
00:07:43.950 --> 00:07:43.960 align:start position:0%
um a young lady was going in with her
 
00:07:46.869 --> 00:07:46.879 align:start position:0%
two grandchildren into City Hall and the
 
00:07:49.710 --> 00:07:49.720 align:start position:0%
person coming out of City Hall resorted
 
00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
to call her to nword several several
 
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:55.240 align:start position:0%
times she has no clue what made that
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
person do that didn't know the woman or
 
00:07:59.869 --> 00:07:59.879 align:start position:0%
anything so of course the kids
 
00:08:02.149 --> 00:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
frightened grabbed hold of Grandma you
 
00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
know little boy was four he grabbed hold
 
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:06.520 align:start position:0%
of Grandma all right so but she went on
 
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:08.440 align:start position:0%
in city hall went into the area City
 
00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639 align:start position:0%
Hall where she was going to pay a bill
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
the woman came behind her into that
 
00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:15.560 align:start position:0%
location in City Hall still calling her
 
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
the nword and the kids were petrified
 
00:08:20.909 --> 00:08:20.919 align:start position:0%
someone in City Hall made the phone call
 
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:22.560 align:start position:0%
to the police and that person was
 
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:25.960 align:start position:0%
arrested and was charged yeah which I
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
would think would make sense as she
 
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:29.360 align:start position:0%
should be so this bill would repeal that
 
00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:30.919 align:start position:0%
and give that person the right to do
 
00:08:34.709 --> 00:08:34.719 align:start position:0%
that if exactly if if you take this out
 
00:08:36.509 --> 00:08:36.519 align:start position:0%
they don't necessarily have that right
 
00:08:39.029 --> 00:08:39.039 align:start position:0%
that person to be charged that's what
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
I'm saying so no I would not take that
 
00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:43.360 align:start position:0%
out so you were are an agreement that
 
00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
this would give people um the legal leg
 
00:08:51.389 --> 00:08:51.399 align:start position:0%
to absolutely to intimidate harass and
 
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
yeah because you can't um you know like
 
00:08:55.550 --> 00:08:55.560 align:start position:0%
I was speaking to one of our members and
 
00:08:56.949 --> 00:08:56.959 align:start position:0%
they were saying that I'm you know words
 
00:08:59.750 --> 00:08:59.760 align:start position:0%
don't heard I said excuse me we all know
 
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
that words can hurt depending on what
 
00:09:03.069 --> 00:09:03.079 align:start position:0%
the words are and what you're saying to
 
00:09:05.470 --> 00:09:05.480 align:start position:0%
the person and how angry or how vulgar
 
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
you are with the person it does hurt and
 
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:11.200 align:start position:0%
it could cite violence and in that case
 
00:09:12.750 --> 00:09:12.760 align:start position:0%
of course you got two grandchildren with
 
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:14.360 align:start position:0%
you you're definitely not going to try
 
00:09:16.630 --> 00:09:16.640 align:start position:0%
to to go back at someone but had that
 
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:18.880 align:start position:0%
been a different situation it might have
 
00:09:21.949 --> 00:09:21.959 align:start position:0%
ended differently yes and with freedom
 
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:24.480 align:start position:0%
comes responsibility I mean you can't
 
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
you just can't do that and you know so
 
00:09:32.509 --> 00:09:32.519 align:start position:0%
yeah I think so basically
 
00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:35.360 align:start position:0%
um you know clearly we can't we can't
 
00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
legislate a person's feelings right you
 
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
know you're you're responsible for your
 
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
own feelings and those those belong to
 
00:09:42.710 --> 00:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
you I you know I'm not going to take
 
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:44.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility for someone else feels I
 
00:09:46.949 --> 00:09:46.959 align:start position:0%
also don't think that we we also have to
 
00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
live in
 
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.480 align:start position:0%
a civil society where we all you know
 
00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:52.120 align:start position:0%
there's there's an expectation when you
 
00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
walk out your door right and when you
 
00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:57.760 align:start position:0%
start taking away any kind of
 
00:09:59.790 --> 00:09:59.800 align:start position:0%
expectation of some normal see then you
 
00:10:03.829 --> 00:10:03.839 align:start position:0%
just have Anarchy right right um and
 
00:10:06.670 --> 00:10:06.680 align:start position:0%
quite honestly I I'm really trying to
 
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:08.480 align:start position:0%
figure out how everything else would go
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
in to play here if you took out one
 
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:14.600 align:start position:0%
whole you know paragraph but they all
 
00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:16.360 align:start position:0%
seem to kind of go in with each other
 
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:20.200 align:start position:0%
and I don't I really just don't see the
 
00:10:22.069 --> 00:10:22.079 align:start position:0%
point of any of it to be honest with you
 
00:10:26.829 --> 00:10:26.839 align:start position:0%
I I think it's ridiculous um and I don't
 
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:29.560 align:start position:0%
know you know exactly what what the
 
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:32.240 align:start position:0%
intent of it is either right because I
 
00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:34.600 align:start position:0%
you know all I remember him saying when
 
00:10:36.750 --> 00:10:36.760 align:start position:0%
he was here was that you know if he
 
00:10:39.629 --> 00:10:39.639 align:start position:0%
wants to be able to you know say and if
 
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:41.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not if I'm remembering correctly
 
00:10:43.069 --> 00:10:43.079 align:start position:0%
what he said
 
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:46.560 align:start position:0%
was a lot of slang words and like a lot
 
00:10:48.190 --> 00:10:48.200 align:start position:0%
of obscene words you know you're this
 
00:10:51.389 --> 00:10:51.399 align:start position:0%
you're this what I mean I guess if you
 
00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:53.079 align:start position:0%
want to say that you're going to say it
 
00:10:56.230 --> 00:10:56.240 align:start position:0%
anyway and then you
 
00:10:59.790 --> 00:10:59.800 align:start position:0%
know they don't want it to be they as
 
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:01.680 align:start position:0%
the the sponsor I'm saying they don't
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
want it to be illegal they don't want to
 
00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:04.360 align:start position:0%
be able to get in trouble for such
 
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:06.320 align:start position:0%
things at the end of the day if it
 
00:11:08.069 --> 00:11:08.079 align:start position:0%
escalates to where you are being
 
00:11:10.230 --> 00:11:10.240 align:start position:0%
disorderly and you're causing all this
 
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
Havoc then you know it is what it is so
 
00:11:16.110 --> 00:11:16.120 align:start position:0%
I I think um we're all saying the same
 
00:11:18.269 --> 00:11:18.279 align:start position:0%
thing and maybe a little bit differently
 
00:11:20.030 --> 00:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
but I think we're both saying the same
 
00:11:21.550 --> 00:11:21.560 align:start position:0%
thing here so
 
00:11:26.590 --> 00:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
abely well um we don't have a quorum so
 
00:11:29.310 --> 00:11:29.320 align:start position:0%
we can't even technically vote this out
 
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:32.320 align:start position:0%
but I I do know that we can still make a
 
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:35.240 align:start position:0%
recommendation and you
 
00:11:37.590 --> 00:11:37.600 align:start position:0%
know my personal recommendation just
 
00:11:40.590 --> 00:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
would be to itl
 
00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:42.470 align:start position:0%
would be to itl
Bill

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
okay well that's where we're at and mine
 
00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:48.760 align:start position:0%
would be the same anyway so
 
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:51.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm going to make an IT
 
00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:55.069 align:start position:0%
yeah so I'm going to make an IT
recommendation

00:11:55.069 --> 00:11:55.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:57.949 --> 00:11:57.959 align:start position:0%
and here it's just going to be a
 
00:11:57.959 --> 00:12:01.590 align:start position:0%
and here it's just going to be a
recommendation

00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:03.550 --> 00:12:03.560 align:start position:0%
I'll just put that you moved it is that
 
00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.629 align:start position:0%
I'll just put that you moved it is that
okay

00:12:04.629 --> 00:12:04.639 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
yep I don't know that we can officially
 
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:09.800 align:start position:0%
do it but
 
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:12.600 align:start position:0%
mys all right well that was
 
00:12:15.189 --> 00:12:15.199 align:start position:0%
um a really long way
 
00:12:17.949 --> 00:12:17.959 align:start position:0%
for 10 minutes
 
00:12:20.430 --> 00:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
time all right this is how our weed one
 
00:12:23.030 --> 00:12:23.040 align:start position:0%
went too right it was like the police
 
00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:24.760 align:start position:0%
Chiefs have anything that they wanted to
 
00:12:27.870 --> 00:12:27.880 align:start position:0%
say before we close anything out
 
00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:36.230 align:start position:0%
say before we close anything out
or

00:12:36.230 --> 00:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.949 align:start position:0%

00:12:59.150 --> 00:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
Es okay pretty much what we we okay all
 
00:13:03.629 --> 00:13:03.639 align:start position:0%
right okay all right well um that's it
 
00:13:06.030 --> 00:13:06.040 align:start position:0%
we're going to make a recommendation to
 
00:13:10.069 --> 00:13:10.079 align:start position:0%
the whole committee itl it and whenever
 
00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:12.880 align:start position:0%
we vote it out I I suspect that it'll go
 
00:13:14.710 --> 00:13:14.720 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar but you know we
 
00:13:16.590 --> 00:13:16.600 align:start position:0%
could be wrong can't can't speak for
 
00:13:19.189 --> 00:13:19.199 align:start position:0%
other people then then are right here so
 
00:13:21.790 --> 00:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
all right we good good job all right I
 
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:25.720 align:start position:0%
am closing the subcommittee work session
 
00:13:32.389 --> 00:13:32.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:32.399 --> 00:13:38.389 align:start position:0%
 
go

00:13:38.389 --> 00:13:38.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
education not to
 
00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:43.399 align:start position:0%
tou but you know I mean because how
 
00:13:45.750 --> 00:13:45.760 align:start position:0%
about that woman that was or not even
 
00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:47.880 align:start position:0%
the woman the guy that was in the
 
00:13:50.069 --> 00:13:50.079 align:start position:0%
restaurant I don't know who it was with
 
00:13:53.310 --> 00:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
it I Paul maybe and they followed him
 
00:13:54.749 --> 00:13:54.759 align:start position:0%
into the restaurant and they were
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:57.759 --> 00:14:00.759 align:start position:0%
