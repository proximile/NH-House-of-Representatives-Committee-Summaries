room so but uh so I I I found it very
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
enlightening in terms of the the issues
 
00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:02.440 align:start position:0%
that are out there with the two
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
different kind of Medicare products and
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%

00:15:27.629 --> 00:15:27.639 align:start position:0%
discussion yes I spent a week studying
 
00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:30.240 align:start position:0%
this and having been on Medicare for 13
 
00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:32.680 align:start position:0%
years I felt it was time for me to go
 
00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:34.160 align:start position:0%
back and look and see what's going on so
 
00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:38.480 align:start position:0%
I made some charts okay okay spear
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%

copy yes yes I would be glad to email my
 
00:15:51.230 --> 00:15:51.240 align:start position:0%
charts cool okay one of the things that
 
00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:54.360 align:start position:0%
did not come out in this uh in in the in
 
00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:57.040 align:start position:0%
the meeting is that there are no more
 
00:16:01.309 --> 00:16:01.319 align:start position:0%
Medicare standard plans that cover Plan
 
00:16:04.749 --> 00:16:04.759 align:start position:0%
B uh plan Part B
 
00:16:07.309 --> 00:16:07.319 align:start position:0%
deductibles it used to be a plan F that
 
00:16:09.790 --> 00:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
was discontinued yeah f it used to be a
 
00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
plan C but that became Medicare
 
00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:15.920 align:start position:0%
Advantage yes right now according to
 
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:19.600 align:start position:0%
CMS there are no plans to cover the
 
00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:22.360 align:start position:0%
deductibles there are a couple of plans
 
00:16:26.309 --> 00:16:26.319 align:start position:0%
K and L that cover plan a deductibles
 
00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:30.880 align:start position:0%
but at the rate of 50% or 75 5% with
 
00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:34.240 align:start position:0%
out-of pocket maximums of 7,200 or 3600
 
00:16:37.470 --> 00:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
depending on what you have there is one
 
00:16:39.629 --> 00:16:39.639 align:start position:0%
advantage that I can see a Medicare
 
00:16:42.110 --> 00:16:42.120 align:start position:0%
standard that Medicare Advantage doesn't
 
00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
have and that is Medicare standard
 
00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:47.040 align:start position:0%
covers the entire United States there's
 
00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:50.800 align:start position:0%
only one network Medicare Advantage is
 
00:16:56.110 --> 00:16:56.120 align:start position:0%

not you don't need a referral or it can
 
00:17:08.309 --> 00:17:08.319 align:start position:0%
be HMO which means you do need a
 
00:17:11.069 --> 00:17:11.079 align:start position:0%
referral and you can specify the size of
 
00:17:13.630 --> 00:17:13.640 align:start position:0%

00:17:37.830 --> 00:17:37.840 align:start position:0%
you know that includes
 
00:17:40.870 --> 00:17:40.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh at 70% of the doctors
 
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:43.880 align:start position:0%
in that area so you can select plans all
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
across that but the advantage that
 
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:48.000 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage has that Medicare
 
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:50.320 align:start position:0%
regular doesn't have is whatever these
 
00:17:53.390 --> 00:17:53.400 align:start position:0%
supplemental plans are in Medicare
 
00:17:55.190 --> 00:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
Advantage there's no supplementals per
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
se you you are free to switch from any
 
00:18:00.909 --> 00:18:00.919 align:start position:0%
version of the plan you want every
 
00:18:04.630 --> 00:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
single year and your uh your
 
00:18:06.669 --> 00:18:06.679 align:start position:0%
pre-existing conditions are
 
00:18:10.430 --> 00:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
covered according to uh Kaiser Family
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
Foundation only 2% of people switch
 
00:18:15.950 --> 00:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
between plans most people are satisfied
 
00:18:17.430 --> 00:18:17.440 align:start position:0%
they switch back and
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
forth they say to use Medicare now the
 
00:18:23.110 --> 00:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
only recommendation I see for Medicare
 
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:26.240 align:start position:0%
standard is if you are uh living in two
 
00:18:27.590 --> 00:18:27.600 align:start position:0%
states you know for instance let's say
 
00:18:29.390 --> 00:18:29.400 align:start position:0%
you go to Florida for 6 months a year
 
00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
and then New York for 6 months a year
 
00:18:32.990 --> 00:18:33.000 align:start position:0%
you might want to go with standard
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
Medicare because you're covered in both
 
00:18:36.590 --> 00:18:36.600 align:start position:0%
carriers whereas if you live in one
 
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:37.669 align:start position:0%
carriers whereas if you live in one
place

00:18:37.669 --> 00:18:37.679 align:start position:0%
place
 
00:18:40.710 --> 00:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
essentially then you would get Medicare
 
00:18:45.110 --> 00:18:45.120 align:start position:0%
Advantage 95% according to kff 95% of
 
00:18:48.230 --> 00:18:48.240 align:start position:0%
Medicare Advantage uh clients are very
 
00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:50.400 align:start position:0%
satisfied with their coverage they're
 
00:18:52.830 --> 00:18:52.840 align:start position:0%
finding no problem you can start out at
 
00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:54.840 align:start position:0%
65 and thinking that you're healthy and
 
00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:55.960 align:start position:0%
believing you're not going to get into
 
00:18:57.990 --> 00:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
an accident and go with a very minimal
 
00:19:01.710 --> 00:19:01.720 align:start position:0%
plan that cost L anything or you can
 
00:19:03.990 --> 00:19:04.000 align:start position:0%
have a pre develop a pre a condition
 
00:19:05.669 --> 00:19:05.679 align:start position:0%
where you need to have some real careful
 
00:19:06.669 --> 00:19:06.679 align:start position:0%
care and then you're going to have to
 
00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
pay more money for the plan and get it
 
00:19:11.390 --> 00:19:11.400 align:start position:0%
get a broader deeper plan and you get to
 
00:19:12.870 --> 00:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
have to pick your insurance company
 
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:14.200 align:start position:0%
whichever one you feel good about and
 
00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:16.520 align:start position:0%
there's a whole pot load of those and
 
00:19:18.190 --> 00:19:18.200 align:start position:0%
you get to so you have a lot of choice
 
00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:19.880 align:start position:0%
and maybe the best thing somebody has to
 
00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:21.640 align:start position:0%
do is to consult somebody who
 
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
understands all these things and I will
 
00:19:25.990 --> 00:19:26.000 align:start position:0%
be glad to email out my little charts
 
00:19:26.909 --> 00:19:26.919 align:start position:0%
and you
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
can pick your own insurance
 
00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:32.360 align:start position:0%
so my recommendation is we should just
 
00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:34.520 align:start position:0%
kind of stop the bill
 
00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.000 align:start position:0%
because it doesn't do what people think
 
00:19:38.710 --> 00:19:38.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to do you can't switch back
 
00:19:40.510 --> 00:19:40.520 align:start position:0%
to Medicare and think you're going to
 
00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:42.200 align:start position:0%
get deductibles played they don't play
 
00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:45.190 align:start position:0%
get deductibles played they don't play
them

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:45.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:46.750 align:start position:0%
 
anymore

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
so so representative spe second by
 
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:51.360 align:start position:0%
representative pusc moves inexpedient to
 
00:19:53.549 --> 00:19:53.559 align:start position:0%
legislate on House Bill 185 is there any
 
00:19:55.630 --> 00:19:55.640 align:start position:0%
discussion on the
 
00:19:58.270 --> 00:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
motion seeing none all those in favor
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
please raise your hand one
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
two oh okay just here one two 3 four uh
 
00:20:11.990 --> 00:20:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:16.510 --> 00:20:16.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
so silly oh what was the right what was
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:24.880 --> 00:20:26.390 align:start position:0%
 
6

00:20:26.390 --> 00:20:26.400 align:start position:0%
6
 
00:20:29.990 --> 00:20:30.000 align:start position:0%
okay spe
 
00:20:38.590 --> 00:20:38.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
say I I think I feel almost almost
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.669 --> 00:21:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:21.360 align:start position:0%
241 fine next
 
00:21:24.669 --> 00:21:24.679 align:start position:0%
up uh Al spill 241 relative treatment of
 
00:21:26.149 --> 00:21:26.159 align:start position:0%
alternatives to
 
00:21:29.510 --> 00:21:29.520 align:start position:0%
opioids um so you well I sent out an
 
00:21:33.029 --> 00:21:33.039 align:start position:0%
amendment and ran up the flag uh but the
 
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
um sponsor is begging us to retain this
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
Bill yes have we seen your
 
00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:43.789 align:start position:0%
Bill yes have we seen your
Amendment

00:21:43.789 --> 00:21:43.799 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
00:21:47.870 --> 00:21:47.880 align:start position:0%
uh I don't know did
 
00:21:50.230 --> 00:21:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh uh that is true you might not have
 
00:21:55.269 --> 00:21:55.279 align:start position:0%
gotten it um it was I mailed I yeah I
 
00:21:59.310 --> 00:21:59.320 align:start position:0%
mailed it out um you me he was drawn up
 
00:22:02.310 --> 00:22:02.320 align:start position:0%
by Alex at the department and so the all
 
00:22:05.710 --> 00:22:05.720 align:start position:0%
the carriers got it and then and he got
 
00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:08.120 align:start position:0%
it and he yeah I guess you I guess you
 
00:22:10.190 --> 00:22:10.200 align:start position:0%
didn't get it so but I was waiting for
 
00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:14.070 align:start position:0%
didn't get it so but I was waiting for
his

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:14.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
okay you know so and it was it was
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
basically the I would say the the rub
 
00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
right now in terms of the way you know
 
00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
the issue is is how do we and make sure
 
00:22:27.470 --> 00:22:27.480 align:start position:0%
patients are well informed in terms of
 
00:22:29.990 --> 00:22:30.000 align:start position:0%
making the choices about what they do
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
and the problem is is so my the way we
 
00:22:34.549 --> 00:22:34.559 align:start position:0%
wrote the amendment was well that means
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
we're going to have the insurance
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
companies you know send out a letter to
 
00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:42.240 align:start position:0%
to the patients and say you know uh what
 
00:22:44.029 --> 00:22:44.039 align:start position:0%
what are all the different Alternatives
 
00:22:47.390 --> 00:22:47.400 align:start position:0%
that are available to them that um it it
 
00:22:49.390 --> 00:22:49.400 align:start position:0%
sort of reachs that we're practicing
 
00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:53.120 align:start position:0%
medicine so that that creates a problem
 
00:22:54.549 --> 00:22:54.559 align:start position:0%
and we don't want to we don't want to
 
00:22:57.470 --> 00:22:57.480 align:start position:0%
get into that that situation yeah I just
 
00:22:59.669 --> 00:22:59.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to say for the record that um we
 
00:23:01.230 --> 00:23:01.240 align:start position:0%
don't have we don't have information
 
00:23:03.310 --> 00:23:03.320 align:start position:0%
about the efficacy of some of these
 
00:23:05.710 --> 00:23:05.720 align:start position:0%
treatments you know and you know I was
 
00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:08.360 align:start position:0%
re I mean apparently massage works for
 
00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:10.880 align:start position:0%
some things and not for others etc etc
 
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:13.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm not comfortable giving a blanket
 
00:23:15.990 --> 00:23:16.000 align:start position:0%
um well it was narrowed we definitely
 
00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:17.760 align:start position:0%
narrowed it down to the ones that were
 
00:23:19.669 --> 00:23:19.679 align:start position:0%
already were already you know like I
 
00:23:21.470 --> 00:23:21.480 align:start position:0%
mean the big one is chiropractic is
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
already satory you know but in the
 
00:23:27.909 --> 00:23:27.919 align:start position:0%
Statue but I think that um I think
 
00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:29.200 align:start position:0%
what's really
 
00:23:32.510 --> 00:23:32.520 align:start position:0%
important that we most need and I'm not
 
00:23:35.269 --> 00:23:35.279 align:start position:0%
saying this for the camera that is for
 
00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:39.320 align:start position:0%
people you know is the um the nature of
 
00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.080 align:start position:0%
healthc care has had in my all my years
 
00:23:46.669 --> 00:23:46.679 align:start position:0%
have been doing this job is that um that
 
00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:48.360 align:start position:0%
manage care was always about how you
 
00:23:50.430 --> 00:23:50.440 align:start position:0%
know what we do to get you
 
00:23:53.909 --> 00:23:53.919 align:start position:0%
healthy and mental health really kind of
 
00:23:57.029 --> 00:23:57.039 align:start position:0%
brought out that well that's a problem
 
00:24:00.470 --> 00:24:00.480 align:start position:0%
because that um some people are never
 
00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:02.080 align:start position:0%
you know with mental health issues
 
00:24:03.510 --> 00:24:03.520 align:start position:0%
you're you're you're that you have that
 
00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:06.000 align:start position:0%
for the rest of your life and so now we
 
00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:07.240 align:start position:0%
get into
 
00:24:10.029 --> 00:24:10.039 align:start position:0%
maintenance and well Managed Care is not
 
00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:12.080 align:start position:0%
that's not one of its favorite things to
 
00:24:14.630 --> 00:24:14.640 align:start position:0%
be doing is maintenance you know is that
 
00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:16.360 align:start position:0%
there it's more built around let's you
 
00:24:17.510 --> 00:24:17.520 align:start position:0%
know how do we get
 
00:24:22.029 --> 00:24:22.039 align:start position:0%
you cured and um I think that this bill
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
brings out the the same issues we have
 
00:24:26.590 --> 00:24:26.600 align:start position:0%
with mental health which is and then and
 
00:24:28.710 --> 00:24:28.720 align:start position:0%
I and I was this was acutely Weare of
 
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:31.320 align:start position:0%
this back as I was in the room when uh
 
00:24:35.430 --> 00:24:35.440 align:start position:0%
we took up um Chiropractic and the way
 
00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:37.360 align:start position:0%
the Chiropractic tattoo you know
 
00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
originally was that you know insurance
 
00:24:42.389 --> 00:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
companies were were treating it mostly I
 
00:24:43.789 --> 00:24:43.799 align:start position:0%
I would say like mental health you know
 
00:24:45.750 --> 00:24:45.760 align:start position:0%
the utilization review that they you
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
know how many times they'll give you x
 
00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
amount of visits but then after that
 
00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
they were cutting you off and the cutter
 
00:24:53.029 --> 00:24:53.039 align:start position:0%
packed and that back then there was two
 
00:24:55.669 --> 00:24:55.679 align:start position:0%
kinds of chiropractor lobbyists there
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
was uh one who was the streets the other
 
00:24:59.870 --> 00:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
was the mix and I won't tell you who the
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
names of the people but but but it was a
 
00:25:04.510 --> 00:25:04.520 align:start position:0%
very interesting because there was two
 
00:25:06.630 --> 00:25:06.640 align:start position:0%
different you know coming in and the
 
00:25:09.990 --> 00:25:10.000 align:start position:0%
issue was um how how to make sure that
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
CH you know that people wanted
 
00:25:13.830 --> 00:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
chiropratic forever they they want to
 
00:25:17.149 --> 00:25:17.159 align:start position:0%
get the get the twist forever and so the
 
00:25:21.870 --> 00:25:21.880 align:start position:0%
the end end result was um is that uh we
 
00:25:23.870 --> 00:25:23.880 align:start position:0%
did pass the bill that says if the
 
00:25:26.669 --> 00:25:26.679 align:start position:0%
insurance company covers chiropractor
 
00:25:28.950 --> 00:25:28.960 align:start position:0%
that yes you can get 12 visit it's a
 
00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:31.919 align:start position:0%
year and with deductibles and you know
 
00:25:34.269 --> 00:25:34.279 align:start position:0%
you know copays and whatever and that's
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
been on the Statue feels like 20 years
 
00:25:39.029 --> 00:25:39.039 align:start position:0%
it feels how long it's been out there um
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
so that is already on the books it's out
 
00:25:44.029 --> 00:25:44.039 align:start position:0%
there um and so it really is sort of a
 
00:25:47.470 --> 00:25:47.480 align:start position:0%
baseline but um sure enough um siga and
 
00:25:48.909 --> 00:25:48.919 align:start position:0%
I can use that name because they don't
 
00:25:50.310 --> 00:25:50.320 align:start position:0%
they're not in the small group Market
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
anyways but they actually uh it was
 
00:25:56.389 --> 00:25:56.399 align:start position:0%
called Health Health Source I I forget
 
00:25:58.470 --> 00:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
what was the name Health Health Source
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
at the time and they they actually
 
00:26:02.750 --> 00:26:02.760 align:start position:0%
dropped Chiropractic when we passed that
 
00:26:05.870 --> 00:26:05.880 align:start position:0%
that mandate and but eventually um they
 
00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:07.960 align:start position:0%
they did eventually turn around and
 
00:26:10.510 --> 00:26:10.520 align:start position:0%
cover it but um but that just goes to
 
00:26:11.990 --> 00:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
show that when we do a mandate there is
 
00:26:14.430 --> 00:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
a implication to you know to the
 
00:26:16.909 --> 00:26:16.919 align:start position:0%
companies who whether they want to abide
 
00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:19.760 align:start position:0%
by it or not so Mr chair could you
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
define twists the twists
 
00:26:27.870 --> 00:26:27.880 align:start position:0%
yes well that's what I call it and I
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
would say um years ago I haven't been to
 
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:33.080 align:start position:0%
a chiropractor in a very long time but
 
00:26:36.110 --> 00:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
when I yeah a really long time and I and
 
00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:38.480 align:start position:0%
and I do remember when I was picking up
 
00:26:40.950 --> 00:26:40.960 align:start position:0%
my father-in-law and you picked him up
 
00:26:44.310 --> 00:26:44.320 align:start position:0%
and and but when I go I I would go to
 
00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:46.360 align:start position:0%
the cack and they do that where they lay
 
00:26:49.070 --> 00:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
over and do that that twist and and and
 
00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
I would say over my life at that back
 
00:26:53.950 --> 00:26:53.960 align:start position:0%
then you know three three times and
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
every time they just one twist was all I
 
00:26:58.909 --> 00:26:58.919 align:start position:0%
needed and I was good to go um and they
 
00:26:59.990 --> 00:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
would always say don't you want to come
 
00:27:02.310 --> 00:27:02.320 align:start position:0%
back again and I go I'll let you know
 
00:27:03.950 --> 00:27:03.960 align:start position:0%
whether I need it or not and they never
 
00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:06.200 align:start position:0%
did so
 
00:27:09.950 --> 00:27:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay so um I'll make the motion to
 
00:27:14.710 --> 00:27:14.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:21.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
pusc okay any discussion on the motion
 
00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:26.310 align:start position:0%
pusc okay any discussion on the motion
to

00:27:26.310 --> 00:27:26.320 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:27:28.710 --> 00:27:28.720 align:start position:0%
retain see none all those in favor raise
 
00:27:58.789 --> 00:27:58.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:59.830 --> 00:27:59.840 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
next house 648 relative to insurance
 
00:28:05.909 --> 00:28:05.919 align:start position:0%
coverage for glucose
 
00:28:11.389 --> 00:28:11.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.269 --> 00:28:15.279 align:start position:0%
one we've gone over a lot of the um
 
00:28:17.230 --> 00:28:17.240 align:start position:0%
reasons why we should be doing this and
 
00:28:19.710 --> 00:28:19.720 align:start position:0%
I feel very strongly
 
00:28:22.230 --> 00:28:22.240 align:start position:0%
that this kind of monitoring is very
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
important and it's going to stop
 
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
problems in the future the problem I
 
00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:29.320 align:start position:0%
have and it's a something I've balanced
 
00:28:32.389 --> 00:28:32.399 align:start position:0%
everything with is it going to risk
 
00:28:34.389 --> 00:28:34.399 align:start position:0%
taking people off the off off the
 
00:28:37.389 --> 00:28:37.399 align:start position:0%
insurance roles and it turns out I I did
 
00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:39.320 align:start position:0%
an analysis and at least as long as I've
 
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:41.880 align:start position:0%
been here which isn't all that long the
 
00:28:44.590 --> 00:28:44.600 align:start position:0%
bills that we have mandated without
 
00:28:47.470 --> 00:28:47.480 align:start position:0%
funding have amounted to about at most
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
$2 a
 
00:28:52.070 --> 00:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
year this one based on analysis provided
 
00:28:55.029 --> 00:28:55.039 align:start position:0%
by Jason uh
 
00:28:59.470 --> 00:28:59.480 align:start position:0%
AES uh is going to amount to $22 a year
 
00:29:03.789 --> 00:29:03.799 align:start position:0%
and that's $22 a year per family member
 
00:29:05.470 --> 00:29:05.480 align:start position:0%
and that is
 
00:29:08.870 --> 00:29:08.880 align:start position:0%
risky my recommendation is we retain the
 
00:29:10.710 --> 00:29:10.720 align:start position:0%
bill see if we can narrow it down a
 
00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:12.080 align:start position:0%
little bit and get the cost down a
 
00:29:14.509 --> 00:29:14.519 align:start position:0%
little more right and so my
 
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:18.000 align:start position:0%
recommendation is to REM is to retain
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
it yeah I in terms of negotiating this
 
00:29:25.630 --> 00:29:25.640 align:start position:0%
bill and finding and trying to get an
 
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:27.360 align:start position:0%
understanding of what is going on now
 
00:29:29.310 --> 00:29:29.320 align:start position:0%
with the insurance companies who were
 
00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:33.000 align:start position:0%
who in the state and um it really gets
 
00:29:38.029 --> 00:29:38.039 align:start position:0%
down to the question of how often you
 
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:41.000 align:start position:0%
test yourself on a daily
 
00:29:44.549 --> 00:29:44.559 align:start position:0%
basis that if you are just sticking your
 
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:46.480 align:start position:0%
your a andc is not high enough you're
 
00:29:48.789 --> 00:29:48.799 align:start position:0%
just sticking yourself once a day you
 
00:29:52.070 --> 00:29:52.080 align:start position:0%
know to see how you're doing um that
 
00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:53.430 align:start position:0%
know to see how you're doing um that
that

00:29:53.430 --> 00:29:53.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:55.149 align:start position:0%
that
that

00:29:55.149 --> 00:29:55.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:57.389 --> 00:29:57.399 align:start position:0%
obviously does not necessarily mean that
 
00:29:59.750 --> 00:29:59.760 align:start position:0%
you're really really need it whereas
 
00:30:02.430 --> 00:30:02.440 align:start position:0%
this machine is clearly necessary if
 
00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:06.360 align:start position:0%
someone's A1C is is bouncing around and
 
00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:09.360 align:start position:0%
and on a daily basis then yes the the
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
protocol is that you should absolutely
 
00:30:13.630 --> 00:30:13.640 align:start position:0%
have one of these monitors and far as
 
00:30:15.110 --> 00:30:15.120 align:start position:0%
we're understanding is that all the
 
00:30:17.430 --> 00:30:17.440 align:start position:0%
insurance companies in the state will
 
00:30:20.590 --> 00:30:20.600 align:start position:0%
cover you if you have multiple you know
 
00:30:22.269 --> 00:30:22.279 align:start position:0%
you know you need to test yourself
 
00:30:25.909 --> 00:30:25.919 align:start position:0%
multiple times a day so that's right I'm
 
00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:27.760 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm s I'm just right so that's the
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
reason why we're retaining that so we're
 
00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
going to find out whether that's really
 
00:30:32.830 --> 00:30:32.840 align:start position:0%
true or not and really get into the
 
00:30:34.549 --> 00:30:34.559 align:start position:0%
groundwork and finding out what what the
 
00:30:37.029 --> 00:30:37.039 align:start position:0%
situation is
 
00:30:40.870 --> 00:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
so um yeah good good idea but just me
 
00:30:42.549 --> 00:30:42.559 align:start position:0%
you're not testifying you're just
 
00:30:42.559 --> 00:30:44.070 align:start position:0%
you're not testifying you're just
sharing

00:30:44.070 --> 00:30:44.080 align:start position:0%
sharing
 
00:30:47.149 --> 00:30:47.159 align:start position:0%
okay chatting just chatting as rep hope
 
00:30:50.389 --> 00:30:50.399 align:start position:0%
Damon uh retired diabetes educator and
 
00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:54.760 align:start position:0%
dietitian um so in response to your
 
00:30:56.549 --> 00:30:56.559 align:start position:0%
remarks Cher
 
00:31:00.590 --> 00:31:00.600 align:start position:0%
hun I don't have the same understanding
 
00:31:03.430 --> 00:31:03.440 align:start position:0%
on a couple points so
 
00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:05.669 align:start position:0%
on a couple points so
one

00:31:05.669 --> 00:31:05.679 align:start position:0%
one
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
um not all insurance companies will pay
 
00:31:10.710 --> 00:31:10.720 align:start position:0%
for continuous glucose
 
00:31:13.230 --> 00:31:13.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring for patients whose diabetes
 
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:16.480 align:start position:0%
is not treated with insulin and we now
 
00:31:19.070 --> 00:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
have in the landscape of Diabetes
 
00:31:23.029 --> 00:31:23.039 align:start position:0%
Care a considerable number of noninsulin
 
00:31:25.789 --> 00:31:25.799 align:start position:0%
pharmaceutical options for type 2
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
diabetes and it is wonderful that we
 
00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:31.600 align:start position:0%
have those options in part because while
 
00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:34.320 align:start position:0%
insulin will effectively control blood
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
sugar you know folks need to learn how
 
00:31:38.629 --> 00:31:38.639 align:start position:0%
to use it and how to dose and so forth
 
00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:41.120 align:start position:0%
it will work to lower blood sugar for
 
00:31:44.190 --> 00:31:44.200 align:start position:0%
sure however it is also associated with
 
00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
weight gain and weight gain is a primary
 
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:49.320 align:start position:0%
variable in increasing risk of
 
00:31:51.590 --> 00:31:51.600 align:start position:0%
complications of diabetes such as heart
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
disease the newer non-insulin
 
00:31:57.029 --> 00:31:57.039 align:start position:0%
medications are generally not associated
 
00:31:58.389 --> 00:31:58.399 align:start position:0%
with weight gain
 
00:32:00.190 --> 00:32:00.200 align:start position:0%
so they're desirable for a number of
 
00:32:02.149 --> 00:32:02.159 align:start position:0%
reasons excuse me but I'd highlight that
 
00:32:03.070 --> 00:32:03.080 align:start position:0%
one in
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
particular that we are decreasing
 
00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:08.360 align:start position:0%
healthare cost when people with type 2
 
00:32:10.870 --> 00:32:10.880 align:start position:0%
diabetes use medications like one
 
00:32:13.110 --> 00:32:13.120 align:start position:0%
category is SG
 
00:32:15.710 --> 00:32:15.720 align:start position:0%
lpt2 um alphabet
 
00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:18.200 align:start position:0%
soup when we decrease the risk of
 
00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:20.320 align:start position:0%
complications we not only help that
 
00:32:22.350 --> 00:32:22.360 align:start position:0%
person have good control of diabetes and
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
go on about their productive life we
 
00:32:27.310 --> 00:32:27.320 align:start position:0%
help them not have the complications
 
00:32:30.269 --> 00:32:30.279 align:start position:0%
that cause so much money
 
00:32:33.990 --> 00:32:34.000 align:start position:0%
so that variable of insurance companies
 
00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.070 align:start position:0%
so that variable of insurance companies
covering

00:32:36.070 --> 00:32:36.080 align:start position:0%
covering
 
00:32:40.870 --> 00:32:40.880 align:start position:0%
CGM for noninsulin treated patients I
 
00:32:43.230 --> 00:32:43.240 align:start position:0%
think is a very important
 
00:32:45.549 --> 00:32:45.559 align:start position:0%
consideration the other piece I'd note
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
in response to your good introductory
 
00:32:52.470 --> 00:32:52.480 align:start position:0%
remarks is yes CGM is more important for
 
00:32:54.950 --> 00:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
people who already were finger stick
 
00:32:58.629 --> 00:32:58.639 align:start position:0%
testing multiple times a day whether to
 
00:33:01.310 --> 00:33:01.320 align:start position:0%
determine the dose of their insulin or
 
00:33:03.389 --> 00:33:03.399 align:start position:0%
to better understand their diabetes or
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
because they um have a great deal of
 
00:33:08.629 --> 00:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
fluctuation in their blood sugars and so
 
00:33:10.710 --> 00:33:10.720 align:start position:0%
they're trying to stay safe like being
 
00:33:12.629 --> 00:33:12.639 align:start position:0%
safe to drive you should not be driving
 
00:33:14.350 --> 00:33:14.360 align:start position:0%
when your blood sugar is
 
00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:16.230 align:start position:0%
when your blood sugar is
plummeting

00:33:16.230 --> 00:33:16.240 align:start position:0%
plummeting
 
00:33:20.230 --> 00:33:20.240 align:start position:0%
um however many people don't test
 
00:33:22.509 --> 00:33:22.519 align:start position:0%
anywhere near as frequently as would be
 
00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:26.360 align:start position:0%
desirable to do for a whole host of
 
00:33:29.549 --> 00:33:29.559 align:start position:0%
reasons um one could simply be that you
 
00:33:31.269 --> 00:33:31.279 align:start position:0%
know it's not particularly comfortable
 
00:33:33.909 --> 00:33:33.919 align:start position:0%
to stick your finger it's not horrible
 
00:33:36.190 --> 00:33:36.200 align:start position:0%
you get used to it to a degree but it's
 
00:33:38.430 --> 00:33:38.440 align:start position:0%
not pleasant there are people who have
 
00:33:42.269 --> 00:33:42.279 align:start position:0%
needle phobia who just cannot muster the
 
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
ability to do that frequently they're
 
00:33:47.750 --> 00:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
they're just in a very very distressed
 
00:33:50.950 --> 00:33:50.960 align:start position:0%
State over the procedure of doing that
 
00:33:52.789 --> 00:33:52.799 align:start position:0%
there are people who have Parkinson's
 
00:33:54.870 --> 00:33:54.880 align:start position:0%
disease or other causes of Tremors and
 
00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:56.480 align:start position:0%
they literally physically can't really
 
00:33:58.870 --> 00:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
do it effectively so they need somebody
 
00:34:01.509 --> 00:34:01.519 align:start position:0%
to help them or people who are in their
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
workplace setting they don't have a
 
00:34:05.789 --> 00:34:05.799 align:start position:0%
situation where they can just run off
 
00:34:07.110 --> 00:34:07.120 align:start position:0%
and check their blood sugar and they
 
00:34:08.790 --> 00:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
can't do it at their workstation where
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
they're working if you have a CGM all
 
00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:13.720 align:start position:0%
you have to do is grab your phone and
 
00:34:16.470 --> 00:34:16.480 align:start position:0%
just read it or it alerts on your phone
 
00:34:20.230 --> 00:34:20.240 align:start position:0%
automatically depending on the device
 
00:34:23.069 --> 00:34:23.079 align:start position:0%
so I I guess I'd like to ask if it's
 
00:34:25.710 --> 00:34:25.720 align:start position:0%
okay for me to ask the committee are
 
00:34:28.470 --> 00:34:28.480 align:start position:0%
there folks here who who are not yet
 
00:34:30.790 --> 00:34:30.800 align:start position:0%
convinced of the need for
 
00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:34.040 align:start position:0%
CGM in any person with diabetes who is
 
00:34:35.629 --> 00:34:35.639 align:start position:0%
willing to use it to treat their
 
00:34:39.230 --> 00:34:39.240 align:start position:0%
diabetes Well you just threw a curveball
 
00:34:42.069 --> 00:34:42.079 align:start position:0%
I did yes because you were talking about
 
00:34:46.470 --> 00:34:46.480 align:start position:0%
insulin okay so no nobody in this room
 
00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:48.760 align:start position:0%
is going to argue that someone who has
 
00:34:51.389 --> 00:34:51.399 align:start position:0%
to take insulin on a daily
 
00:34:54.069 --> 00:34:54.079 align:start position:0%
basis that there needs to be proper
 
00:34:56.869 --> 00:34:56.879 align:start position:0%
monitoring of taking that insulin what
 
00:34:58.790 --> 00:34:58.800 align:start position:0%
you've just said is oh no forget about
 
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:00.680 align:start position:0%
those people now let talk about the
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
people who are taking a medication for
 
00:35:05.069 --> 00:35:05.079 align:start position:0%
their a
 
00:35:11.230 --> 00:35:11.240 align:start position:0%
andc and um and have not not don't need
 
00:35:14.109 --> 00:35:14.119 align:start position:0%
insulin that brings first of all forget
 
00:35:16.069 --> 00:35:16.079 align:start position:0%
about the people with insulin I would
 
00:35:17.950 --> 00:35:17.960 align:start position:0%
never in a million years say that but
 
00:35:20.470 --> 00:35:20.480 align:start position:0%
that isn't an issue in this bill because
 
00:35:21.910 --> 00:35:21.920 align:start position:0%
as you noted
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
correctly the people who take insulin
 
00:35:26.910 --> 00:35:26.920 align:start position:0%
already have access to CGM whether
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
they're type one or type 2 I do not
 
00:35:32.150 --> 00:35:32.160 align:start position:0%
believe that that is a problem but only
 
00:35:37.069 --> 00:35:37.079 align:start position:0%
30% of people 30 35 Le um of people with
 
00:35:40.510 --> 00:35:40.520 align:start position:0%
type two diabetes are treated with
 
00:35:42.630 --> 00:35:42.640 align:start position:0%
insulin some of those people are not
 
00:35:44.630 --> 00:35:44.640 align:start position:0%
treated with insulin because they won't
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
do an injectable medication similar
 
00:35:50.510 --> 00:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
reasons to the issues with finger sticks
 
00:35:52.870 --> 00:35:52.880 align:start position:0%
many of them are not treated with
 
00:35:55.190 --> 00:35:55.200 align:start position:0%
insulin because we have better ways to
 
00:35:58.109 --> 00:35:58.119 align:start position:0%
treat it the meds that I referred to
 
00:35:59.710 --> 00:35:59.720 align:start position:0%
some of which are oral and some of which
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
are injectable so that's I'm sorry that
 
00:36:04.790 --> 00:36:04.800 align:start position:0%
sounded like a curveball cuz I thought
 
00:36:06.270 --> 00:36:06.280 align:start position:0%
we had talked about you're testing
 
00:36:09.550 --> 00:36:09.560 align:start position:0%
yourself multiple times a day even even
 
00:36:11.950 --> 00:36:11.960 align:start position:0%
if you're on a pill did you only a pill
 
00:36:14.470 --> 00:36:14.480 align:start position:0%
that take you only take that pill once a
 
00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:18.560 align:start position:0%
day you so that depends on the
 
00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:22.720 align:start position:0%
individual patient and it depends on
 
00:36:25.790 --> 00:36:25.800 align:start position:0%
where their diabetes management is at
 
00:36:28.230 --> 00:36:28.240 align:start position:0%
and it's not a static resp response even
 
00:36:29.950 --> 00:36:29.960 align:start position:0%
for the individual patient so for
 
00:36:33.790 --> 00:36:33.800 align:start position:0%
example we might say to a patient newly
 
00:36:37.190 --> 00:36:37.200 align:start position:0%
on a non-insulin
 
00:36:39.390 --> 00:36:39.400 align:start position:0%
medication we might recommend that they
 
00:36:41.150 --> 00:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
check their blood sugar several times a
 
00:36:44.910 --> 00:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
day for the first two weeks to see how
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
are they responding to that how's it
 
00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:48.560 align:start position:0%
working do we need to make adjustments
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
do they need to time their eating
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
differently or their
 
00:36:55.790 --> 00:36:55.800 align:start position:0%
exercise what all the variables are
 
00:36:58.630 --> 00:36:58.640 align:start position:0%
right and then if if
 
00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:02.920 align:start position:0%
their uh results are good and
 
00:37:05.390 --> 00:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
consistent they might not need to test
 
00:37:07.390 --> 00:37:07.400 align:start position:0%
as frequently and that person might be
 
00:37:09.390 --> 00:37:09.400 align:start position:0%
well informed by a CGM but I don't know
 
00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:11.440 align:start position:0%
that I'd say it was necessary that I
 
00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:13.000 align:start position:0%
want you to understand that's exactly
 
00:37:15.430 --> 00:37:15.440 align:start position:0%
why we're retaining this bill we're
 
00:37:17.670 --> 00:37:17.680 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out that threshold
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
we're trying we have we're we are
 
00:37:22.390 --> 00:37:22.400 align:start position:0%
obligated obviously in terms of figuring
 
00:37:23.990 --> 00:37:24.000 align:start position:0%
out what we're going to mandate to the
 
00:37:25.349 --> 00:37:25.359 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and what they have
 
00:37:28.109 --> 00:37:28.119 align:start position:0%
to do is that we have to said draw this
 
00:37:30.589 --> 00:37:30.599 align:start position:0%
line where is the
 
00:37:30.599 --> 00:37:32.109 align:start position:0%
line where is the
appropriate

00:37:32.109 --> 00:37:32.119 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
00:37:34.589 --> 00:37:34.599 align:start position:0%
level and you know obviously you you
 
00:37:37.109 --> 00:37:37.119 align:start position:0%
know we might not agree on this issue
 
00:37:39.710 --> 00:37:39.720 align:start position:0%
okay but and as I can't you know you
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
know refer representative spe says these
 
00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
machines are not cheap okay and you know
 
00:37:46.750 --> 00:37:46.760 align:start position:0%
the and you you're going to get a new
 
00:37:49.190 --> 00:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
new one or whatever yeah represent
 
00:37:50.790 --> 00:37:50.800 align:start position:0%
Spirit you want follow up I wanted to
 
00:37:52.390 --> 00:37:52.400 align:start position:0%
make a comment on that none of us are
 
00:37:57.750 --> 00:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
doctors none of us can say what the real
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
scope of how diabetes should be managed
 
00:38:05.750 --> 00:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
right and I've looked at it every way I
 
00:38:08.950 --> 00:38:08.960 align:start position:0%
can with with Hope's help every way I
 
00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:11.160 align:start position:0%
can and on the surface not being a
 
00:38:13.990 --> 00:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
doctor I think we got to do something
 
00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:16.880 align:start position:0%
but one thing I do know is
 
00:38:22.589 --> 00:38:22.599 align:start position:0%
numbers and $22 a year per family member
 
00:38:24.230 --> 00:38:24.240 align:start position:0%
is going to knock people off the
 
00:38:27.230 --> 00:38:27.240 align:start position:0%
insurance roles and that I do understand
 
00:38:28.829 --> 00:38:28.839 align:start position:0%
and can talk
 
00:38:31.150 --> 00:38:31.160 align:start position:0%
to and so while I can't talk to the
 
00:38:32.990 --> 00:38:33.000 align:start position:0%
medical part of it I can talk to that
 
00:38:36.150 --> 00:38:36.160 align:start position:0%
part of it right can can I ask I
 
00:38:37.790 --> 00:38:37.800 align:start position:0%
somebody from either the the insurance
 
00:38:38.990 --> 00:38:39.000 align:start position:0%
department do you agree with that
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
assessment that it would be $22 a person
 
00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:45.760 align:start position:0%
per year so the before he speaks the $22
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
was based on the unamended bill when it
 
00:38:53.550 --> 00:38:53.560 align:start position:0%
included the exemption from deductible
 
00:38:53.560 --> 00:38:54.470 align:start position:0%
included the exemption from deductible
and

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.069 align:start position:0%
and
copay

00:38:56.069 --> 00:38:56.079 align:start position:0%
copay
 
00:38:58.710 --> 00:38:58.720 align:start position:0%
so with the
 
00:39:01.470 --> 00:39:01.480 align:start position:0%
amendment with the devices
 
00:39:04.750 --> 00:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
being um subject to
 
00:39:07.349 --> 00:39:07.359 align:start position:0%
deductible the $22 is no long why we
 
00:39:08.950 --> 00:39:08.960 align:start position:0%
have to retain it because we don't have
 
00:39:10.670 --> 00:39:10.680 align:start position:0%
those numbers we would we would we need
 
00:39:13.990 --> 00:39:14.000 align:start position:0%
to have that study done
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah do you want to hear from the
 
00:39:22.349 --> 00:39:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:25.109 --> 00:39:25.119 align:start position:0%
insurance I wasn't prepared to talk on
 
00:39:27.790 --> 00:39:27.800 align:start position:0%
this Jason AES director health E omics
 
00:39:29.910 --> 00:39:29.920 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department we did
 
00:39:32.670 --> 00:39:32.680 align:start position:0%
write a fiscal note on this bill I just
 
00:39:34.670 --> 00:39:34.680 align:start position:0%
want to point out two two key things
 
00:39:37.430 --> 00:39:37.440 align:start position:0%
that the technique that we use is we try
 
00:39:39.349 --> 00:39:39.359 align:start position:0%
to identify the marginal cost of this
 
00:39:41.069 --> 00:39:41.079 align:start position:0%
mandate if it were enacted so how much
 
00:39:43.109 --> 00:39:43.119 align:start position:0%
does each unit cost with all of the
 
00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:47.800 align:start position:0%
other things note noteworthy are um the
 
00:39:49.589 --> 00:39:49.599 align:start position:0%
clinical requirements that are also
 
00:39:51.630 --> 00:39:51.640 align:start position:0%
associated with which are 18 months I
 
00:39:54.550 --> 00:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
would suggest those or are organized in
 
00:39:57.710 --> 00:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
the plan year not 18 months just for con
 
00:40:00.630 --> 00:40:00.640 align:start position:0%
in cost reporting but the um then we
 
00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:02.880 align:start position:0%
multiply that times the new eligible
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
population that's the spous part because
 
00:40:08.270 --> 00:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
the technique we use is how many people
 
00:40:10.309 --> 00:40:10.319 align:start position:0%
become eligible that weren't previously
 
00:40:12.670 --> 00:40:12.680 align:start position:0%
eligible if this bill were to become law
 
00:40:14.030 --> 00:40:14.040 align:start position:0%
and I just wanted to point out that
 
00:40:16.069 --> 00:40:16.079 align:start position:0%
insulin therapy status is the current
 
00:40:18.430 --> 00:40:18.440 align:start position:0%
eligibility criteria not frequency of
 
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:21.960 align:start position:0%
blood um is correct right so so we look
 
00:40:24.510 --> 00:40:24.520 align:start position:0%
at What proportion of the population who
 
00:40:26.910 --> 00:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
have diabetes have type 2 diabetes and
 
00:40:28.349 --> 00:40:28.359 align:start position:0%
of them What proportion as
 
00:40:30.990 --> 00:40:31.000 align:start position:0%
representative Damon stated um are
 
00:40:33.829 --> 00:40:33.839 align:start position:0%
currently on any type of insulin therapy
 
00:40:36.710 --> 00:40:36.720 align:start position:0%
and it's it's approximately 30 to
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
32% um as a as a side note it is
 
00:40:42.829 --> 00:40:42.839 align:start position:0%
noteworthy that Medicare has reduced the
 
00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
criteria for that eligibility basis
 
00:40:47.790 --> 00:40:47.800 align:start position:0%
based on three multiple daily injections
 
00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:50.440 align:start position:0%
down to two as of April 2024 so you do
 
00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:53.640 align:start position:0%
see this indeed this migration away from
 
00:40:55.750 --> 00:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
the intensity of insulin therapy as a
 
00:40:55.760 --> 00:40:57.390 align:start position:0%
the intensity of insulin therapy as a
criteria

00:40:57.390 --> 00:40:57.400 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
00:40:59.870 --> 00:40:59.880 align:start position:0%
taken together that value I think that
 
00:41:01.470 --> 00:41:01.480 align:start position:0%
representative spear is talking about is
 
00:41:04.829 --> 00:41:04.839 align:start position:0%
the upper limit of the um absolute cost
 
00:41:07.230 --> 00:41:07.240 align:start position:0%
if taken all things together if this
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
bill were
 
00:41:11.589 --> 00:41:11.599 align:start position:0%
enacted knowing that it'll never be 100%
 
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
of the new eligible population that
 
00:41:17.470 --> 00:41:17.480 align:start position:0%
would take this up but some unforeseen
 
00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:19.599 align:start position:0%
proportion of that which is that why we
 
00:41:21.630 --> 00:41:21.640 align:start position:0%
put indeterminable because we don't know
 
00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400 align:start position:0%
that it's it's it's having one one for
 
00:41:27.710 --> 00:41:27.720 align:start position:0%
years is it's quite invasive and it's
 
00:41:29.910 --> 00:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
actually it adds to the work burden of
 
00:41:32.309 --> 00:41:32.319 align:start position:0%
managing the chronic disease of diabetes
 
00:41:33.910 --> 00:41:33.920 align:start position:0%
so we know that it's not going to be
 
00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
100% so it's hard to predict what will
 
00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:39.240 align:start position:0%
be the absolute fiscal impact if this
 
00:41:41.309 --> 00:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
bill would become LW but I have a couple
 
00:41:43.829 --> 00:41:43.839 align:start position:0%
of suggestions I think that we could
 
00:41:46.230 --> 00:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
make this bill more narrow if we better
 
00:41:48.470 --> 00:41:48.480 align:start position:0%
Define the eligible population I heard
 
00:41:50.030 --> 00:41:50.040 align:start position:0%
represent that's what that's exactly
 
00:41:51.750 --> 00:41:51.760 align:start position:0%
what we're saying we're talking about
 
00:41:53.670 --> 00:41:53.680 align:start position:0%
this so bifurcating the different types
 
00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:55.720 align:start position:0%
of diabetes Therapies in the type two
 
00:41:57.670 --> 00:41:57.680 align:start position:0%
population those who take medication
 
00:42:00.030 --> 00:42:00.040 align:start position:0%
those who don't and maybe what types of
 
00:42:02.430 --> 00:42:02.440 align:start position:0%
medication right and that and that's the
 
00:42:04.470 --> 00:42:04.480 align:start position:0%
we hope okay so just everybody
 
00:42:06.390 --> 00:42:06.400 align:start position:0%
understand what retaining means means we
 
00:42:09.109 --> 00:42:09.119 align:start position:0%
will re come back to this in
 
00:42:11.950 --> 00:42:11.960 align:start position:0%
September and and work on it in
 
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:14.560 align:start position:0%
September and we will have to vote on it
 
00:42:17.270 --> 00:42:17.280 align:start position:0%
has to come out of committee uh by the
 
00:42:19.349 --> 00:42:19.359 align:start position:0%
end of October and it'll be on the house
 
00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:22.839 align:start position:0%
floor in January but if you want to work
 
00:42:24.829 --> 00:42:24.839 align:start position:0%
on it over the summer and we can get
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
nailed down an amendment really good
 
00:42:30.430 --> 00:42:30.440 align:start position:0%
in the usual way that I have I'd be glad
 
00:42:33.589 --> 00:42:33.599 align:start position:0%
to help work with that happy to help I
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
work at the behest of commissioner bet
 
00:42:38.309 --> 00:42:38.319 align:start position:0%
cour so his directive we're happy to
 
00:42:40.990 --> 00:42:41.000 align:start position:0%
help elucidate and he seems to listen to
 
00:42:43.630 --> 00:42:43.640 align:start position:0%
us so we will make sure that thank you
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
so much so I just I just want to ask
 
00:42:49.349 --> 00:42:49.359 align:start position:0%
representative spere where where did you
 
00:42:52.309 --> 00:42:52.319 align:start position:0%
uh how did you get the $22 a person that
 
00:42:54.950 --> 00:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
was in the fiscal note okay well no not
 
00:42:56.630 --> 00:42:56.640 align:start position:0%
exactly if you remember at the end of
 
00:43:00.670 --> 00:43:00.680 align:start position:0%
list here uh Dr AIS gave us a report
 
00:43:01.750 --> 00:43:01.760 align:start position:0%
okay that's right that's right and I
 
00:43:03.750 --> 00:43:03.760 align:start position:0%
used that report as the
 
00:43:06.430 --> 00:43:06.440 align:start position:0%
basis and then calculated the numbers
 
00:43:08.750 --> 00:43:08.760 align:start position:0%
and sent it back to him and he said it
 
00:43:12.589 --> 00:43:12.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:15.309 --> 00:43:15.319 align:start position:0%
okay see are you a lawyer too then not
 
00:43:16.470 --> 00:43:16.480 align:start position:0%
just a
 
00:43:19.510 --> 00:43:19.520 align:start position:0%
doctor okay so uh you I see you had your
 
00:43:21.589 --> 00:43:21.599 align:start position:0%
hand up I think she did the hand for us
 
00:43:24.710 --> 00:43:24.720 align:start position:0%
okay represent thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:26.640 align:start position:0%
just a comment that I think retaining
 
00:43:29.589 --> 00:43:29.599 align:start position:0%
the bill is the best idea specifically
 
00:43:34.390 --> 00:43:34.400 align:start position:0%
in light of the uh page two uh lines 1
 
00:43:37.710 --> 00:43:37.720 align:start position:0%
through six where it discusses not
 
00:43:41.069 --> 00:43:41.079 align:start position:0%
needing a prescription for this medical
 
00:43:43.309 --> 00:43:43.319 align:start position:0%
device um so I think that's something
 
00:43:45.790 --> 00:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
that certainly needs to be taken up in
 
00:43:51.549 --> 00:43:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:51.559 --> 00:43:54.190 align:start position:0%
 
it

00:43:54.190 --> 00:43:54.200 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:43:58.309 --> 00:43:58.319 align:start position:0%
okay yes um I think because of two
 
00:44:00.069 --> 00:44:00.079 align:start position:0%
reasons this bill should be considered
 
00:44:02.710 --> 00:44:02.720 align:start position:0%
one is that I don't agree uh the
 
00:44:05.069 --> 00:44:05.079 align:start position:0%
insurance company's definition of
 
00:44:06.950 --> 00:44:06.960 align:start position:0%
medical necessity which is in the bill
 
00:44:09.910 --> 00:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
is already somebody taking insulin and
 
00:44:11.990 --> 00:44:12.000 align:start position:0%
in that part but the issue is that when
 
00:44:13.630 --> 00:44:13.640 align:start position:0%
you go to the doctor for diabetic
 
00:44:17.309 --> 00:44:17.319 align:start position:0%
related diabetes or diab problems the
 
00:44:19.750 --> 00:44:19.760 align:start position:0%
doctor doesn't see that the doctor
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
basically prescribes that based on the
 
00:44:25.870 --> 00:44:25.880 align:start position:0%
status of your how how far along you are
 
00:44:28.910 --> 00:44:28.920 align:start position:0%
in diabetes in a reading etc etc right
 
00:44:31.589 --> 00:44:31.599 align:start position:0%
the insulin therapy is not the threshold
 
00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:34.280 align:start position:0%
that they prescribe this machine they
 
00:44:36.910 --> 00:44:36.920 align:start position:0%
prescribe it before that also so there
 
00:44:39.190 --> 00:44:39.200 align:start position:0%
is a big difference between the medical
 
00:44:41.270 --> 00:44:41.280 align:start position:0%
necessity definition from the insurance
 
00:44:43.870 --> 00:44:43.880 align:start position:0%
department and the medical practice
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
Department that is something needs to be
 
00:44:48.230 --> 00:44:48.240 align:start position:0%
looked at and right now the insurance
 
00:44:51.190 --> 00:44:51.200 align:start position:0%
company keeps following the standard
 
00:44:53.750 --> 00:44:53.760 align:start position:0%
that they have put in place for medical
 
00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
necessity so that needs to be Revisited
 
00:44:58.790 --> 00:44:58.800 align:start position:0%
with the definition of what the medical
 
00:45:00.790 --> 00:45:00.800 align:start position:0%
community or medical
 
00:45:03.950 --> 00:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
providers they look at it as necessary
 
00:45:05.790 --> 00:45:05.800 align:start position:0%
to have this that is one thing second
 
00:45:08.190 --> 00:45:08.200 align:start position:0%
thing is that this device I mean right
 
00:45:10.589 --> 00:45:10.599 align:start position:0%
now what we are always struggling is
 
00:45:14.470 --> 00:45:14.480 align:start position:0%
that we try to prescri we we try to
 
00:45:17.589 --> 00:45:17.599 align:start position:0%
cover this by insurance only when the
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
diabetes goes to the final level when
 
00:45:21.549 --> 00:45:21.559 align:start position:0%
you get into insulin therapy which is
 
00:45:24.270 --> 00:45:24.280 align:start position:0%
the last stage of diabetes basically if
 
00:45:27.190 --> 00:45:27.200 align:start position:0%
if you if you allow people to have this
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
device as is what medical community or
 
00:45:31.670 --> 00:45:31.680 align:start position:0%
medical doctors they recommend to use
 
00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:34.040 align:start position:0%
before this might not you might not go
 
00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
to that level of diabetes where you need
 
00:45:39.150 --> 00:45:39.160 align:start position:0%
a insulin therapy I mean diabetes not
 
00:45:40.430 --> 00:45:40.440 align:start position:0%
diabetes is not measured just because
 
00:45:43.069 --> 00:45:43.079 align:start position:0%
somebody is taking insulin there are 70%
 
00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:45.359 align:start position:0%
people who are in diabetic in grave
 
00:45:48.309 --> 00:45:48.319 align:start position:0%
danger diabetes and they their A1C is
 
00:45:50.069 --> 00:45:50.079 align:start position:0%
pretty shot up but they don't take
 
00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:52.920 align:start position:0%
insulin therapy why do you want to wait
 
00:45:55.150 --> 00:45:55.160 align:start position:0%
uh for people to go to that level when
 
00:45:57.030 --> 00:45:57.040 align:start position:0%
basically you have nothing you can't do
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
anything except taking therapy so I feel
 
00:46:02.349 --> 00:46:02.359 align:start position:0%
that uh and like this bill was saying
 
00:46:05.990 --> 00:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
that if the medical community of if the
 
00:46:08.510 --> 00:46:08.520 align:start position:0%
medical doctor who is treating you feels
 
00:46:12.270 --> 00:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
NE feels necessity of having this device
 
00:46:13.430 --> 00:46:13.440 align:start position:0%
then that device should be covered by
 
00:46:15.670 --> 00:46:15.680 align:start position:0%
insurance that would be my argument
 
00:46:19.390 --> 00:46:19.400 align:start position:0%
towards it to keep this bill okay thank
 
00:46:23.230 --> 00:46:23.240 align:start position:0%
you okay so yeah I'm not sure if we
 
00:46:25.630 --> 00:46:25.640 align:start position:0%
covered this in my notes um again this
 
00:46:28.790 --> 00:46:28.800 align:start position:0%
is a very small small population right
 
00:46:32.030 --> 00:46:32.040 align:start position:0%
we're talking of the market that will be
 
00:46:34.470 --> 00:46:34.480 align:start position:0%
required to cover this so we're really
 
00:46:36.589 --> 00:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
talking about a very small bring up the
 
00:46:37.750 --> 00:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
fact that it's the problem with that
 
00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
even we mandate this that small large
 
00:46:42.150 --> 00:46:42.160 align:start position:0%
employers unfortunately it will just
 
00:46:45.390 --> 00:46:45.400 align:start position:0%
help a very small population but um the
 
00:46:47.390 --> 00:46:47.400 align:start position:0%
question that I have is is this covered
 
00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
under Medicare or Medicaid I was just
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
looking for a guidance on so what what
 
00:46:55.990 --> 00:46:56.000 align:start position:0%
what is it you said it was it it still
 
00:47:02.790 --> 00:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:06.950 --> 00:47:06.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:10.030 --> 00:47:10.040 align:start position:0%
Med you have to be on insulin so that
 
00:47:11.589 --> 00:47:11.599 align:start position:0%
was the thing I see that's where that's
 
00:47:13.109 --> 00:47:13.119 align:start position:0%
why I said you threw a curve
 
00:47:16.390 --> 00:47:16.400 align:start position:0%
because everything I heard so far when
 
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
in terms of my research on this was that
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
it was insulin driven and now you're
 
00:47:23.430 --> 00:47:23.440 align:start position:0%
saying oh wait there's some people who
 
00:47:27.069 --> 00:47:27.079 align:start position:0%
take medications and don't have you know
 
00:47:28.870 --> 00:47:28.880 align:start position:0%
like I assume like like my met Foreman
 
00:47:33.069 --> 00:47:33.079 align:start position:0%
that I'm taking because I I reached my
 
00:47:35.870 --> 00:47:35.880 align:start position:0%
6.4 and another doctor says to me boy
 
00:47:37.670 --> 00:47:37.680 align:start position:0%
they're they're getting radical starting
 
00:47:39.150 --> 00:47:39.160 align:start position:0%
because usually it's you see all the
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
commercials it's you know we'll get you
 
00:47:42.510 --> 00:47:42.520 align:start position:0%
under seven right you get you you know
 
00:47:45.270 --> 00:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
seven so so six like Po why am I taking
 
00:47:47.030 --> 00:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
the Met for well I'm taking it because
 
00:47:48.510 --> 00:47:48.520 align:start position:0%
you know I'm trying to be proactive
 
00:47:51.470 --> 00:47:51.480 align:start position:0%
about it okay and and and met foran is
 
00:47:52.390 --> 00:47:52.400 align:start position:0%
cheapap you
 
00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:54.520 align:start position:0%
know insurance company doesn't mind
 
00:47:56.190 --> 00:47:56.200 align:start position:0%
covering it so I I figured that was a
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
good thing to do but no I I stopped
 
00:48:00.750 --> 00:48:00.760 align:start position:0%
taking my blood sugar to you know I I
 
00:48:02.950 --> 00:48:02.960 align:start position:0%
when my first when I first diagnosed I
 
00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
was taking my blood sugar you know
 
00:48:05.950 --> 00:48:05.960 align:start position:0%
several times a day just seeing what's
 
00:48:09.309 --> 00:48:09.319 align:start position:0%
going on and then now I I I have do it
 
00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:12.440 align:start position:0%
rarely so that that that was really the
 
00:48:15.270 --> 00:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
the issue with the threshold issue um is
 
00:48:17.069 --> 00:48:17.079 align:start position:0%
you know and and that's I'm
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
saying we're not saying we don't want to
 
00:48:22.109 --> 00:48:22.119 align:start position:0%
pass this bill okay we are we are
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely motivated to to pass
 
00:48:27.670 --> 00:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
something okay and um representative
 
00:48:30.109 --> 00:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
Street said we absolutely believe that
 
00:48:32.390 --> 00:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
that that determination is is your
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
doctor makes that
 
00:48:37.750 --> 00:48:37.760 align:start position:0%
diagnosis okay the the problem is is
 
00:48:40.470 --> 00:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
that that you know is the diagnosis you
 
00:48:43.150 --> 00:48:43.160 align:start position:0%
know is based upon you know the because
 
00:48:44.430 --> 00:48:44.440 align:start position:0%
that's obviously a doctor patient
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
relationship okay but that yes the um in
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
the the relationship in terms of of what
 
00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:53.720 align:start position:0%
is being prescribed to that physician
 
00:48:56.470 --> 00:48:56.480 align:start position:0%
you know what he's prescribing and I I
 
00:48:58.230 --> 00:48:58.240 align:start position:0%
don't know anything about these
 
00:49:01.150 --> 00:49:01.160 align:start position:0%
non-insulin things I mean I guess it is
 
00:49:02.910 --> 00:49:02.920 align:start position:0%
so Med foran is considered a non-insulin
 
00:49:04.430 --> 00:49:04.440 align:start position:0%
bill you're talking about so you're
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
saying that I should be eligible because
 
00:49:08.109 --> 00:49:08.119 align:start position:0%
I take metformin that I should be able
 
00:49:09.910 --> 00:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
to get one of these
 
00:49:16.870 --> 00:49:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
would but they wouldn't need a
 
00:49:20.589 --> 00:49:20.599 align:start position:0%
prescription under this
 
00:49:22.789 --> 00:49:22.799 align:start position:0%
bill but under this bill they wouldn't
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
need a do that would that would be
 
00:49:26.349 --> 00:49:26.359 align:start position:0%
deleted that that would be gone no it
 
00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:28.640 align:start position:0%
would have to to be a physician you know
 
00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:30.200 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day yeah the physician
 
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
has to describe it you have to you know
 
00:49:34.950 --> 00:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
so but anyways I just we just want to
 
00:49:36.630 --> 00:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
know what exactly are the thresholds I
 
00:49:39.069 --> 00:49:39.079 align:start position:0%
mean what is the the medical necessity
 
00:49:40.990 --> 00:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
when when does that physician make that
 
00:49:44.309 --> 00:49:44.319 align:start position:0%
decision and so you know from what I was
 
00:49:46.789 --> 00:49:46.799 align:start position:0%
what I was reading you know was uh was
 
00:49:48.470 --> 00:49:48.480 align:start position:0%
that if someone who's being tested
 
00:49:51.430 --> 00:49:51.440 align:start position:0%
multiple times a day needed be testing
 
00:49:53.870 --> 00:49:53.880 align:start position:0%
mulle say because their their blood
 
00:50:01.549 --> 00:50:01.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:05.390 --> 00:50:05.400 align:start position:0%
C critical very appropriate appropriate
 
00:50:06.470 --> 00:50:06.480 align:start position:0%
let's say
 
00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:09.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate but I would offer that that
 
00:50:12.349 --> 00:50:12.359 align:start position:0%
is not the only circumstance and that's
 
00:50:14.349 --> 00:50:14.359 align:start position:0%
and that's what we want to learn about
 
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
and to make sure that we articulate and
 
00:50:20.789 --> 00:50:20.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:22.990 --> 00:50:23.000 align:start position:0%
legislation we don't we testified
 
00:50:24.910 --> 00:50:24.920 align:start position:0%
already so this is not a testimony this
 
00:50:26.349 --> 00:50:26.359 align:start position:0%
is what we're trying to do is work on
 
00:50:29.470 --> 00:50:29.480 align:start position:0%
the language so you'll help us help us
 
00:50:31.829 --> 00:50:31.839 align:start position:0%
when we work on this language that
 
00:50:34.630 --> 00:50:34.640 align:start position:0%
you'll help us
 
00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:39.430 align:start position:0%
you'll help us
sorry

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:41.789 --> 00:50:41.799 align:start position:0%
oh believe it or not it is bring
 
00:50:44.470 --> 00:50:44.480 align:start position:0%
hospital has BR hospital my appointment
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
bring this hospital for for something
 
00:50:50.670 --> 00:50:50.680 align:start position:0%
else for something else can I just have
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
a quick followup yes please thank you so
 
00:50:58.670 --> 00:50:58.680 align:start position:0%
then also in the bill is um um in to
 
00:51:01.150 --> 00:51:01.160 align:start position:0%
qualify for the coverage the uh
 
00:51:03.670 --> 00:51:03.680 align:start position:0%
recipient must participate in follow-up
 
00:51:06.390 --> 00:51:06.400 align:start position:0%
care so I just wanted to make sure that
 
00:51:09.390 --> 00:51:09.400 align:start position:0%
that additional follow-up care at least
 
00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh once every six months during the
 
00:51:14.430 --> 00:51:14.440 align:start position:0%
first 18 months access to uh teleah
 
00:51:16.470 --> 00:51:16.480 align:start position:0%
Health Etc I want to make sure that
 
00:51:19.470 --> 00:51:19.480 align:start position:0%
that's all covered in the cost and how
 
00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:21.880 align:start position:0%
how that would work which when you do
 
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
the when they do a cost analysis that
 
00:51:26.349 --> 00:51:26.359 align:start position:0%
yes it me your multiple visits correct
 
00:51:28.829 --> 00:51:28.839 align:start position:0%
and not sure what the coverage would be
 
00:51:31.950 --> 00:51:31.960 align:start position:0%
currently but this would also need to be
 
00:51:34.549 --> 00:51:34.559 align:start position:0%
um taken into account so it's on I
 
00:51:36.510 --> 00:51:36.520 align:start position:0%
believe even based on when we looked at
 
00:51:40.670 --> 00:51:40.680 align:start position:0%
it that most of the non CGM related
 
00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
stuff was covered I mean got multiple
 
00:51:44.510 --> 00:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
visits and all that sort of thing for
 
00:51:47.549 --> 00:51:47.559 align:start position:0%
anybody with a with a uh an insulin uh
 
00:51:50.270 --> 00:51:50.280 align:start position:0%
not an insulin a glucose problem does
 
00:51:52.309 --> 00:51:52.319 align:start position:0%
get monitored yeah right I I think the
 
00:51:54.789 --> 00:51:54.799 align:start position:0%
monitoring is absolutely necessary but
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
that needs to be if it's additional
 
00:51:59.870 --> 00:51:59.880 align:start position:0%
visits how is all that going to be
 
00:52:01.589 --> 00:52:01.599 align:start position:0%
calculated in the overall right well I I
 
00:52:03.270 --> 00:52:03.280 align:start position:0%
can just say myself personally that you
 
00:52:06.950 --> 00:52:06.960 align:start position:0%
know that um I I I do get my blood fed
 
00:52:09.670 --> 00:52:09.680 align:start position:0%
drawn the fasting blood drawn twice a
 
00:52:13.030 --> 00:52:13.040 align:start position:0%
year so that insurance you know that so
 
00:52:14.950 --> 00:52:14.960 align:start position:0%
I've never had any push back from that
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
and that but that's the requirement
 
00:52:18.230 --> 00:52:18.240 align:start position:0%
because they we were steadily watching
 
00:52:20.150 --> 00:52:20.160 align:start position:0%
my blood sugar you know get up and up
 
00:52:21.910 --> 00:52:21.920 align:start position:0%
and then they move the goal poost back
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
from 130 to 100
 
00:52:27.069 --> 00:52:27.079 align:start position:0%
and that's not
 
00:52:30.309 --> 00:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
it's not fair so anyway yes no that is
 
00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:32.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely when we do our
 
00:52:38.270 --> 00:52:38.280 align:start position:0%
fun insurance no right now I'm in so
 
00:52:39.950 --> 00:52:39.960 align:start position:0%
anyway but I was in the small group so I
 
00:52:41.390 --> 00:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
was acutely aware of the small group
 
00:52:45.190 --> 00:52:45.200 align:start position:0%
problem yes represent so I would suggest
 
00:52:48.589 --> 00:52:48.599 align:start position:0%
that you know rather than uh
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
debating that what requirements should
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
be there to allow this as covered or not
 
00:52:58.510 --> 00:52:58.520 align:start position:0%
covered is and like you know two times
 
00:53:00.589 --> 00:53:00.599 align:start position:0%
like I said or three times taking test
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
and the the readings are shooting up and
 
00:53:06.270 --> 00:53:06.280 align:start position:0%
down who is going to benefit Etc I would
 
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
say that let's leave it to
 
00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
the uh medical doctor U assessment of
 
00:53:14.030 --> 00:53:14.040 align:start position:0%
whether the person needs or not if the
 
00:53:15.750 --> 00:53:15.760 align:start position:0%
medical doctor who is seeing the
 
00:53:17.870 --> 00:53:17.880 align:start position:0%
diabetic patient correct feels the need
 
00:53:20.630 --> 00:53:20.640 align:start position:0%
of need to prescribe it right it will be
 
00:53:23.030 --> 00:53:23.040 align:start position:0%
prescribed and then if it's prescribed
 
00:53:25.670 --> 00:53:25.680 align:start position:0%
the insurance compan instead of keeping
 
00:53:28.589 --> 00:53:28.599 align:start position:0%
its own threshold I mean own criteria of
 
00:53:29.710 --> 00:53:29.720 align:start position:0%
covering or not covering which is
 
00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:32.319 align:start position:0%
currently insulin therapy should just
 
00:53:34.470 --> 00:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
listen to the medical doctor who is
 
00:53:37.589 --> 00:53:37.599 align:start position:0%
prescribing it and uh cover it based on
 
00:53:39.789 --> 00:53:39.799 align:start position:0%
the med the medical necessity as
 
00:53:41.950 --> 00:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
determined by the medical doctor not
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
like uh you know like like you said we
 
00:53:46.430 --> 00:53:46.440 align:start position:0%
we had couple of different criteria I
 
00:53:48.589 --> 00:53:48.599 align:start position:0%
can assure you whatever we come up with
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely that key component yeah is
 
00:53:54.789 --> 00:53:54.799 align:start position:0%
that the physician is make making that
 
00:53:56.829 --> 00:53:56.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation so that one one line
 
00:53:59.549 --> 00:53:59.559 align:start position:0%
language itself will eliminate uh
 
00:54:02.030 --> 00:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
various uh uh different criteria should
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
be covered or not covered just that one
 
00:54:07.750 --> 00:54:07.760 align:start position:0%
line will dictate whether I I wish
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes legislation could be just that
 
00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:13.109 align:start position:0%
sometimes legislation could be just that
simple

00:54:13.109 --> 00:54:13.119 align:start position:0%
simple
 
00:54:20.549 --> 00:54:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:27.030 --> 00:54:27.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:29.789 --> 00:54:29.799 align:start position:0%
that prescription is not required we
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
probably need to make that language more
 
00:54:34.030 --> 00:54:34.040 align:start position:0%
clear what the statement the full
 
00:54:36.589 --> 00:54:36.599 align:start position:0%
statement is anology referral of
 
00:54:38.950 --> 00:54:38.960 align:start position:0%
prescription shall not be required
 
00:54:41.430 --> 00:54:41.440 align:start position:0%
because Primary Care Providers can very
 
00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:44.829 align:start position:0%
because Primary Care Providers can very
effectively

00:54:44.829 --> 00:54:44.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:47.349 --> 00:54:47.359 align:start position:0%
address folks
 
00:54:50.789 --> 00:54:50.799 align:start position:0%
tyit from CGM don't
 
00:54:54.030 --> 00:54:54.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily I agree I agree just as long
 
00:54:57.829 --> 00:54:57.839 align:start position:0%
as the prescription is in place okay
 
00:55:00.549 --> 00:55:00.559 align:start position:0%
right EXA I agree again that's the devil

keep working on it okay so the vote is
 
00:55:44.390 --> 00:55:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.829 align:start position:0%
 
zip

00:55:46.829 --> 00:55:46.839 align:start position:0%
zip
 
00:55:52.670 --> 00:55:52.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.230 --> 00:55:58.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:58.240 --> 00:56:00.670 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:56:10.029 --> 00:56:10.039 align:start position:0%
um3 okay so let's I'm going to wait on 7
 
00:56:13.829 --> 00:56:13.839 align:start position:0%
because representative Cole is not
 
00:56:16.309 --> 00:56:16.319 align:start position:0%
here he's on housing this morning with
 
00:56:17.789 --> 00:56:17.799 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbs
 
00:56:21.309 --> 00:56:21.319 align:start position:0%
and so so let's let's just do 297 and
 
00:56:23.710 --> 00:56:23.720 align:start position:0%
then I'll clear out the
 
00:56:37.829 --> 00:56:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:48.069 --> 00:56:48.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.870 --> 00:56:51.880 align:start position:0%
297 so uh like I said that's
 
00:56:55.150 --> 00:56:55.160 align:start position:0%
representative Cole and so he's he's in
 
00:56:57.829 --> 00:56:57.839 align:start position:0%
the other committee
 
00:57:03.870 --> 00:57:03.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.630 --> 00:57:07.640 align:start position:0%
um okay so this I just want yeah we're g
 
00:57:10.150 --> 00:57:10.160 align:start position:0%
we're going to do 297 then then get rid
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
of the room and then and then uh lighten
 
00:57:15.309 --> 00:57:15.319 align:start position:0%
the load here and then and then I'll
 
00:57:16.630 --> 00:57:16.640 align:start position:0%
call them
 
00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:24.510 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:57:24.510 --> 00:57:24.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:57:28.589 --> 00:57:28.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:36.029 --> 00:57:36.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:40.950 --> 00:57:40.960 align:start position:0%
uh okay we got uh
 
00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:47.990 align:start position:0%
uh okay we got uh
Arrow

00:57:47.990 --> 00:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:52.069 --> 00:57:52.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:58.349 --> 00:57:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:04.230 --> 00:58:04.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:07.029 --> 00:58:07.039 align:start position:0%
we we're doing
 
00:58:09.430 --> 00:58:09.440 align:start position:0%
297 what's
 
00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:16.910 align:start position:0%
297 what's
that

00:58:16.910 --> 00:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:24.950 --> 00:58:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:28.670 --> 00:58:28.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
can replace this replaces 176 H
 
00:58:41.470 --> 00:58:41.480 align:start position:0%
yes okay no it does not replace 176 was
 
00:58:44.789 --> 00:58:44.799 align:start position:0%
176 H would be section one of the bill
 
00:58:46.910 --> 00:58:46.920 align:start position:0%
this one okay now okay that replaces
 
00:58:48.390 --> 00:58:48.400 align:start position:0%
that amendment
 
00:58:50.670 --> 00:58:50.680 align:start position:0%
number so just so everyone know so the
 
00:58:53.109 --> 00:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
way that this is written we got um we
 
00:58:57.069 --> 00:58:57.079 align:start position:0%
still have the underlying bill
 
00:58:59.349 --> 00:58:59.359 align:start position:0%
and which is uh is section one of the
 
00:59:01.230 --> 00:59:01.240 align:start position:0%
bill so section
 
00:59:08.390 --> 00:59:08.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:16.109 --> 00:59:16.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:17.910 --> 00:59:17.920 align:start position:0%
into a
 
00:59:22.670 --> 00:59:22.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.670 --> 00:59:26.680 align:start position:0%
story if I may Mr chairman yes DJ Betton
 
00:59:28.190 --> 00:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
cord commissioner of the New Hampshire
 
00:59:30.630 --> 00:59:30.640 align:start position:0%
insurance department let me speak to the
 
00:59:33.470 --> 00:59:33.480 align:start position:0%
length of the proposal at this point so
 
00:59:35.710 --> 00:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned at the outset this is a
 
00:59:37.670 --> 00:59:37.680 align:start position:0%
program that I very very deeply believe
 
00:59:40.029 --> 00:59:40.039 align:start position:0%
in I deeply believe in it because I
 
00:59:40.039 --> 00:59:40.990 align:start position:0%
in I deeply believe in it because I
think

00:59:40.990 --> 00:59:41.000 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:59:44.789 --> 00:59:44.799 align:start position:0%
for a small amount of money you can make
 
00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:48.160 align:start position:0%
a big impact for a lot of consumers when
 
00:59:50.069 --> 00:59:50.079 align:start position:0%
it comes to the affordability of their
 
00:59:50.079 --> 00:59:51.510 align:start position:0%
it comes to the affordability of their
homeowners

00:59:51.510 --> 00:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
homeowners
 
00:59:56.349 --> 00:59:56.359 align:start position:0%
insurance and also and really this if it
 
00:59:58.670 --> 00:59:58.680 align:start position:0%
is not being considered as part of the
 
01:00:01.270 --> 01:00:01.280 align:start position:0%
larger conversation it really should be
 
01:00:03.510 --> 01:00:03.520 align:start position:0%
you know I know there's been a lot of
 
01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:06.359 align:start position:0%
discussion lately about what the state
 
01:00:10.150 --> 01:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
can do to encourage more housing and to
 
01:00:12.990 --> 01:00:13.000 align:start position:0%
be able to retain and attract a younger
 
01:00:14.430 --> 01:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
generation of
 
01:00:16.470 --> 01:00:16.480 align:start position:0%
Workforce and I know that that was a
 
01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:18.880 align:start position:0%
huge priority for governor senu it's now
 
01:00:22.470 --> 01:00:22.480 align:start position:0%
an even bigger priority for governor aot
 
01:00:24.390 --> 01:00:24.400 align:start position:0%
and all of you in the legislature I know
 
01:00:26.029 --> 01:00:26.039 align:start position:0%
have worked hard on it and put resarch
 
01:00:28.750 --> 01:00:28.760 align:start position:0%
ources towards it as well but the piece
 
01:00:30.990 --> 01:00:31.000 align:start position:0%
of this not to be forgotten as I think
 
01:00:32.789 --> 01:00:32.799 align:start position:0%
the vast majority of people in this room
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
know is you cannot get a mortgage from a
 
01:00:37.470 --> 01:00:37.480 align:start position:0%
bank unless you have homeowners
 
01:00:39.870 --> 01:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
insurance coverage and if you are a
 
01:00:43.150 --> 01:00:43.160 align:start position:0%
younger person uh that is not a small
 
01:00:45.470 --> 01:00:45.480 align:start position:0%
bite when you're at the beginning part
 
01:00:47.109 --> 01:00:47.119 align:start position:0%
of your career you're not at your Peak
 
01:00:50.670 --> 01:00:50.680 align:start position:0%
earning potential yet uh and you're
 
01:00:52.870 --> 01:00:52.880 align:start position:0%
really budgeting tightly and I think
 
01:00:55.190 --> 01:00:55.200 align:start position:0%
that this is something that can be a
 
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
useful tool is part of that overall
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
effort that the state is currently
 
01:00:58.559 --> 01:00:59.589 align:start position:0%
effort that the state is currently
engaged

01:00:59.589 --> 01:00:59.599 align:start position:0%
engaged
 
01:01:02.789 --> 01:01:02.799 align:start position:0%
in so because of my belief in the
 
01:01:06.109 --> 01:01:06.119 align:start position:0%
program because I think it is a useful
 
01:01:08.349 --> 01:01:08.359 align:start position:0%
contribution to a larger policy issue
 
01:01:13.190 --> 01:01:13.200 align:start position:0%
you're trying to take on I have engaged
 
01:01:15.950 --> 01:01:15.960 align:start position:0%
with a number of different legislators
 
01:01:17.549 --> 01:01:17.559 align:start position:0%
in a number of different capacities to
 
01:01:19.870 --> 01:01:19.880 align:start position:0%
try to make sure that I'm approaching
 
01:01:21.309 --> 01:01:21.319 align:start position:0%
this and that we are approaching this in
 
01:01:24.870 --> 01:01:24.880 align:start position:0%
a way that works for all of you and so
 
01:01:26.589 --> 01:01:26.599 align:start position:0%
as I mentioned I think the public
 
01:01:29.309 --> 01:01:29.319 align:start position:0%
hearing when we first brought this
 
01:01:32.190 --> 01:01:32.200 align:start position:0%
proposal forward I went and met with the
 
01:01:34.589 --> 01:01:34.599 align:start position:0%
legislative leadership and said how
 
01:01:36.069 --> 01:01:36.079 align:start position:0%
would you like me to do this would you
 
01:01:38.990 --> 01:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
like the bill to be more Broad and then
 
01:01:40.710 --> 01:01:40.720 align:start position:0%
we'll address some of the details in the
 
01:01:43.230 --> 01:01:43.240 align:start position:0%
rulemaking process or do you want more
 
01:01:46.109 --> 01:01:46.119 align:start position:0%
detail in the statute and what they told
 
01:01:48.270 --> 01:01:48.280 align:start position:0%
me was they wanted as much detail in the
 
01:01:51.069 --> 01:01:51.079 align:start position:0%
statute as possible so he said okay
 
01:01:54.349 --> 01:01:54.359 align:start position:0%
we'll do that and then they said we
 
01:01:56.630 --> 01:01:56.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to go through house Commerce
 
01:01:59.069 --> 01:01:59.079 align:start position:0%
first so that's why the bill is at this
 
01:02:01.829 --> 01:02:01.839 align:start position:0%
point as large as it is that is why you
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
all are dealing with it at the time they
 
01:02:06.109 --> 01:02:06.119 align:start position:0%
had said they wanted this to come
 
01:02:08.510 --> 01:02:08.520 align:start position:0%
through this committee the filing period
 
01:02:11.589 --> 01:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
for legislation had closed thus the non
 
01:02:12.910 --> 01:02:12.920 align:start position:0%
gerain Amendment route that we
 
01:02:14.829 --> 01:02:14.839 align:start position:0%
ultimately took and Mr chairman I
 
01:02:17.230 --> 01:02:17.240 align:start position:0%
appreciate your Indulgence in helping us
 
01:02:19.990 --> 01:02:20.000 align:start position:0%
make this process work what I'm here to
 
01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:22.039 align:start position:0%
speak to directly this
 
01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
morning is an alternative manner in
 
01:02:27.870 --> 01:02:27.880 align:start position:0%
which the program would be funded and I
 
01:02:31.269 --> 01:02:31.279 align:start position:0%
noted that when we were at the public
 
01:02:34.109 --> 01:02:34.119 align:start position:0%
hearing the vast majority of questions
 
01:02:35.870 --> 01:02:35.880 align:start position:0%
that the committee had asked about were
 
01:02:37.549 --> 01:02:37.559 align:start position:0%
related to the
 
01:02:40.870 --> 01:02:40.880 align:start position:0%
finances and having sat in your chairs
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
not all that long ago I appreciate the
 
01:02:46.549 --> 01:02:46.559 align:start position:0%
fact that you all right now from a
 
01:02:48.430 --> 01:02:48.440 align:start position:0%
budgetary perspective are having to
 
01:02:51.349 --> 01:02:51.359 align:start position:0%
weigh some difficult choices and some
 
01:02:53.829 --> 01:02:53.839 align:start position:0%
options and I appreciated the fact that
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
the million dooll ask that would come
 
01:02:59.109 --> 01:02:59.119 align:start position:0%
from the IP that would ordinarily go
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
into the general fund but would instead
 
01:03:03.150 --> 01:03:03.160 align:start position:0%
go to this program was going to be an
 
01:03:06.029 --> 01:03:06.039 align:start position:0%
ask and I understood
 
01:03:06.039 --> 01:03:07.630 align:start position:0%
ask and I understood
that

01:03:07.630 --> 01:03:07.640 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:03:10.069 --> 01:03:10.079 align:start position:0%
so I brought it Forward th that was
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
where your focus was I have tried to
 
01:03:15.349 --> 01:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
structure this program as cheaply and
 
01:03:18.190 --> 01:03:18.200 align:start position:0%
efficiently as possible as you know no
 
01:03:21.390 --> 01:03:21.400 align:start position:0%
additional staff will be needed for this
 
01:03:23.549 --> 01:03:23.559 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to run it very lean
 
01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
and very efficiently so two Fridays ago
 
01:03:29.269 --> 01:03:29.279 align:start position:0%
the department had its presentation
 
01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:32.119 align:start position:0%
before house finance division
 
01:03:35.950 --> 01:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
1 and at the end of that presentation I
 
01:03:38.670 --> 01:03:38.680 align:start position:0%
gave them a heads up that this proposal
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
was currently being worked on by this
 
01:03:43.990 --> 01:03:44.000 align:start position:0%
committee and that if it came forward my
 
01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
assumption would be that it would be
 
01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:46.920 align:start position:0%
referred to finance so I just wanted
 
01:03:49.589 --> 01:03:49.599 align:start position:0%
them to be aware and it opened up a
 
01:03:52.670 --> 01:03:52.680 align:start position:0%
larger conversation in which it became
 
01:03:56.470 --> 01:03:56.480 align:start position:0%
very clear to me that
 
01:03:57.950 --> 01:03:57.960 align:start position:0%
the million dollars was just not going
 
01:04:00.910 --> 01:04:00.920 align:start position:0%
to be available for the program so I
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
said I I understand you know when I said
 
01:04:06.470 --> 01:04:06.480 align:start position:0%
that there are seven to nine states who
 
01:04:08.589 --> 01:04:08.599 align:start position:0%
have already implemented this
 
01:04:11.549 --> 01:04:11.559 align:start position:0%
program had I known then what I know now
 
01:04:14.029 --> 01:04:14.039 align:start position:0%
in terms of the the detail of this and
 
01:04:16.029 --> 01:04:16.039 align:start position:0%
the challenge of this I would have said
 
01:04:18.630 --> 01:04:18.640 align:start position:0%
but none of those seven to nine states
 
01:04:20.789 --> 01:04:20.799 align:start position:0%
have New Hampshire's unique tax
 
01:04:23.230 --> 01:04:23.240 align:start position:0%
structure which I think is a very good
 
01:04:26.549 --> 01:04:26.559 align:start position:0%
one forces us to spend wisely and and be
 
01:04:28.589 --> 01:04:28.599 align:start position:0%
Innovative which is what we've tried to
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
do here so in any event a conversation
 
01:04:33.829 --> 01:04:33.839 align:start position:0%
had broken out amongst the members of
 
01:04:35.950 --> 01:04:35.960 align:start position:0%
finance division one in terms of the
 
01:04:39.390 --> 01:04:39.400 align:start position:0%
funding piece and out of that discussion
 
01:04:42.230 --> 01:04:42.240 align:start position:0%
came the concept that you have
 
01:04:46.269 --> 01:04:46.279 align:start position:0%
here so what we are proposing to do is
 
01:04:49.710 --> 01:04:49.720 align:start position:0%
to instead of having an allocation
 
01:04:51.990 --> 01:04:52.000 align:start position:0%
million dollar allocation from again the
 
01:04:54.670 --> 01:04:54.680 align:start position:0%
IP that would ordinarily go into the
 
01:04:56.670 --> 01:04:56.680 align:start position:0%
general fund
 
01:04:59.870 --> 01:04:59.880 align:start position:0%
we have said that as you all know our
 
01:05:03.750 --> 01:05:03.760 align:start position:0%
department is funded via an assessment
 
01:05:06.430 --> 01:05:06.440 align:start position:0%
on insurance carriers it goes through a
 
01:05:09.829 --> 01:05:09.839 align:start position:0%
formula of the per capita written
 
01:05:11.990 --> 01:05:12.000 align:start position:0%
premium of that company it gets a little
 
01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:13.640 align:start position:0%
complicated fortunately we've got a lot
 
01:05:15.230 --> 01:05:15.240 align:start position:0%
of really smart people in the department
 
01:05:17.789 --> 01:05:17.799 align:start position:0%
who understand how that all
 
01:05:22.589 --> 01:05:22.599 align:start position:0%
works so the idea would be we always
 
01:05:25.750 --> 01:05:25.760 align:start position:0%
assess what the maximum amount the
 
01:05:28.630 --> 01:05:28.640 align:start position:0%
department is authorized to spend via
 
01:05:30.789 --> 01:05:30.799 align:start position:0%
the line items in the budget that you
 
01:05:32.349 --> 01:05:32.359 align:start position:0%
all eventually
 
01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
pass in the history of the department
 
01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:38.160 align:start position:0%
almost never have we spent the full
 
01:05:41.109 --> 01:05:41.119 align:start position:0%
allocation we budget wisely and there
 
01:05:43.470 --> 01:05:43.480 align:start position:0%
are always some positions that are not
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
filled either throughout the course of
 
01:05:48.670 --> 01:05:48.680 align:start position:0%
that fiscal year or good parts of that
 
01:05:50.390 --> 01:05:50.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so there's always some money
 
01:05:54.190 --> 01:05:54.200 align:start position:0%
that's underexpanded and so when that
 
01:05:56.510 --> 01:05:56.520 align:start position:0%
happens my belief is
 
01:05:59.109 --> 01:05:59.119 align:start position:0%
um we've budgeted wisely we've assessed
 
01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:01.720 align:start position:0%
the companies for this you you give it
 
01:06:04.150 --> 01:06:04.160 align:start position:0%
back as a credit against the their next
 
01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:06.349 align:start position:0%
back as a credit against the their next
year's

01:06:06.349 --> 01:06:06.359 align:start position:0%
year's
 
01:06:09.510 --> 01:06:09.520 align:start position:0%
assessment so the idea that came forward
 
01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:11.319 align:start position:0%
from house finance
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
was use what you don't spend as part of
 
01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:19.920 align:start position:0%
the assessment up to a million dollars
 
01:06:23.589 --> 01:06:23.599 align:start position:0%
transfer that money into this grant fund
 
01:06:26.870 --> 01:06:26.880 align:start position:0%
and then credit back the rest
 
01:06:30.109 --> 01:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
to the carriers for their next year's
 
01:06:32.870 --> 01:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
assessment that was the
 
01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
concept again as part of the discussion
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
we then included a provision in there
 
01:06:41.990 --> 01:06:42.000 align:start position:0%
that said that if for whatever reason
 
01:06:45.870 --> 01:06:45.880 align:start position:0%
the department did spent um such that
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
there was not a million dollars left
 
01:06:50.670 --> 01:06:50.680 align:start position:0%
over at the end of the fiscal year that
 
01:06:53.990 --> 01:06:54.000 align:start position:0%
we would assess the Delta between
 
01:06:56.390 --> 01:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
whatever was being put into the fund and
 
01:06:57.789 --> 01:06:57.799 align:start position:0%
whatever was needed to be put into the
 
01:07:00.190 --> 01:07:00.200 align:start position:0%
fund for the balance to be a million
 
01:07:03.309 --> 01:07:03.319 align:start position:0%
dollar so for example if the department
 
01:07:05.710 --> 01:07:05.720 align:start position:0%
really went Gang Busters and had a
 
01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
phenomenal year recruiting and filling
 
01:07:09.670 --> 01:07:09.680 align:start position:0%
positions and we spent a lot of money
 
01:07:13.710 --> 01:07:13.720 align:start position:0%
and we only had say 500,000 that we had
 
01:07:16.269 --> 01:07:16.279 align:start position:0%
not expended that fiscal year the
 
01:07:19.430 --> 01:07:19.440 align:start position:0%
500,000 would go into the fund and then
 
01:07:22.549 --> 01:07:22.559 align:start position:0%
we would assess a 500,000 to make up the
 
01:07:24.789 --> 01:07:24.799 align:start position:0%
million I appreciated that that
 
01:07:27.829 --> 01:07:27.839 align:start position:0%
emergency provision would be
 
01:07:30.430 --> 01:07:30.440 align:start position:0%
controversial again it was feedback we
 
01:07:32.430 --> 01:07:32.440 align:start position:0%
had taken in from house finance division
 
01:07:34.710 --> 01:07:34.720 align:start position:0%
one we want the program to go
 
01:07:36.950 --> 01:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
forward seemingly that would be a
 
01:07:39.950 --> 01:07:39.960 align:start position:0%
concept that would work for them but if
 
01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:42.400 align:start position:0%
you're afraid of having us do an
 
01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720 align:start position:0%
additional assessment again I think we
 
01:07:47.190 --> 01:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
can live without it number one because
 
01:07:50.750 --> 01:07:50.760 align:start position:0%
um we've never spent to the degree that
 
01:07:52.109 --> 01:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
we would need to do
 
01:07:55.190 --> 01:07:55.200 align:start position:0%
it uh but number two is I would be
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
perfect L fine to say if we only had a
 
01:08:02.150 --> 01:08:02.160 align:start position:0%
half million dollar to put into the fund
 
01:08:03.990 --> 01:08:04.000 align:start position:0%
for a particular fiscal year the
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
announcement would go out and say we're
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
now accepting applications for the
 
01:08:10.510 --> 01:08:10.520 align:start position:0%
granted State home risk and resiliency
 
01:08:13.549 --> 01:08:13.559 align:start position:0%
program we have up to 500,000 in Grants
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
to give out this year first come first
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
curve serve let's go doesn't have to be
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
a million so if you want to take out
 
01:08:25.910 --> 01:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
that particular provision again so we
 
01:08:28.110 --> 01:08:28.120 align:start position:0%
could call it a pilot
 
01:08:30.110 --> 01:08:30.120 align:start position:0%
program you could call it whatever you'd
 
01:08:31.550 --> 01:08:31.560 align:start position:0%
like if you as long as it goes forward
 
01:08:35.590 --> 01:08:35.600 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman um so Mr chairman as you
 
01:08:37.470 --> 01:08:37.480 align:start position:0%
know we were hammering out the final
 
01:08:41.390 --> 01:08:41.400 align:start position:0%
details of this amendment as of the late
 
01:08:44.990 --> 01:08:45.000 align:start position:0%
uh morning hours yesterday and so we got
 
01:08:46.630 --> 01:08:46.640 align:start position:0%
it to representative hunt as soon as we
 
01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:49.640 align:start position:0%
were comfortable with it as we always do
 
01:08:54.550 --> 01:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
we then sent a copy of it to Industry I
 
01:08:56.709 --> 01:08:56.719 align:start position:0%
have not gotten any feedback Beyond a
 
01:08:58.630 --> 01:08:58.640 align:start position:0%
very brief conversation with one
 
01:09:00.309 --> 01:09:00.319 align:start position:0%
industry representative as I was coming
 
01:09:03.990 --> 01:09:04.000 align:start position:0%
in this morning my understanding is that
 
01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.189 align:start position:0%
in this morning my understanding is that
they're

01:09:05.189 --> 01:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
they're
 
01:09:07.870 --> 01:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
concerned so and and it seems that it's
 
01:09:10.669 --> 01:09:10.679 align:start position:0%
less concern they're equally concerned I
 
01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
guess about both both aspects of what we
 
01:09:16.550 --> 01:09:16.560 align:start position:0%
propose I'll be candid with you I was a
 
01:09:18.709 --> 01:09:18.719 align:start position:0%
little bit surprised that they objected
 
01:09:21.550 --> 01:09:21.560 align:start position:0%
to the first part of it I thought there
 
01:09:24.110 --> 01:09:24.120 align:start position:0%
would be some push back on the provision
 
01:09:26.709 --> 01:09:26.719 align:start position:0%
that allowed for an emergency assessment
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
which again was not something that I
 
01:09:30.470 --> 01:09:30.480 align:start position:0%
felt was absolutely necessary for this
 
01:09:33.669 --> 01:09:33.679 align:start position:0%
to work I don't know the full details of
 
01:09:33.679 --> 01:09:34.550 align:start position:0%
to work I don't know the full details of
those

01:09:34.550 --> 01:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
concerns what I can say is that we did a
 
01:09:41.269 --> 01:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
very rough calculation of what the what
 
01:09:45.030 --> 01:09:45.040 align:start position:0%
a million dollars would mean on average
 
01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:47.359 align:start position:0%
to a company in terms of the credit
 
01:09:49.870 --> 01:09:49.880 align:start position:0%
towards their assessment and the very
 
01:09:52.910 --> 01:09:52.920 align:start position:0%
rough math figures came out to
 
01:09:55.669 --> 01:09:55.679 align:start position:0%
approximately again because it's prad
 
01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
it's going to be different for different
 
01:09:58.750 --> 01:09:58.760 align:start position:0%
companies anywhere in the neighborhood
 
01:10:00.550 --> 01:10:00.560 align:start position:0%
between $40 to
 
01:10:03.350 --> 01:10:03.360 align:start position:0%
$80,000 per
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
company and by the way my understanding
 
01:10:09.149 --> 01:10:09.159 align:start position:0%
is that industry treats their assessment
 
01:10:11.430 --> 01:10:11.440 align:start position:0%
as a sunk cost because there's no
 
01:10:13.590 --> 01:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
guarantee what they're going to get back
 
01:10:15.189 --> 01:10:15.199 align:start position:0%
at the end of every fiscal year it
 
01:10:17.709 --> 01:10:17.719 align:start position:0%
depends on how we
 
01:10:21.229 --> 01:10:21.239 align:start position:0%
budget so from my view this may very
 
01:10:23.870 --> 01:10:23.880 align:start position:0%
well be a case where we're going to
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
agree to disagree with industry we work
 
01:10:29.750 --> 01:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
hard to try to find consensus we always
 
01:10:32.110 --> 01:10:32.120 align:start position:0%
work collaboratively and I appreciate
 
01:10:33.990 --> 01:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
the fact that it came together late so
 
01:10:35.990 --> 01:10:36.000 align:start position:0%
that we didn't get the ability to get
 
01:10:38.550 --> 01:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
full feedback from industry but there's
 
01:10:41.310 --> 01:10:41.320 align:start position:0%
obviously a ways to go in this process
 
01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:43.800 align:start position:0%
there'll be an opportunity for that but
 
01:10:44.870 --> 01:10:44.880 align:start position:0%
if they
 
01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
fundamentally disagree with the idea
 
01:10:49.630 --> 01:10:49.640 align:start position:0%
that we would be able to retain some
 
01:10:51.750 --> 01:10:51.760 align:start position:0%
portion of what we did not spend in our
 
01:10:54.709 --> 01:10:54.719 align:start position:0%
budget for this program again that's
 
01:10:57.630 --> 01:10:57.640 align:start position:0%
just going to be an instance where we
 
01:11:00.870 --> 01:11:00.880 align:start position:0%
have a difference of opinion and that's
 
01:11:04.590 --> 01:11:04.600 align:start position:0%
okay so that is what you have here I'm
 
01:11:06.870 --> 01:11:06.880 align:start position:0%
happy to get into details I can do the
 
01:11:08.870 --> 01:11:08.880 align:start position:0%
musical chairs so it's a very big chair
 
01:11:10.430 --> 01:11:10.440 align:start position:0%
with members of my team if you want to
 
01:11:12.030 --> 01:11:12.040 align:start position:0%
get if you want to just pull up a seat
 
01:11:14.310 --> 01:11:14.320 align:start position:0%
over here and I'm sure George will love
 
01:11:17.189 --> 01:11:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:23.669 --> 01:11:23.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:26.590 --> 01:11:26.600 align:start position:0%
George um so
 
01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
yeah want yeah this is a subcommittee
 
01:11:33.430 --> 01:11:33.440 align:start position:0%
this is not you know
 
01:11:35.750 --> 01:11:35.760 align:start position:0%
informal right remember the old days
 
01:11:37.709 --> 01:11:37.719 align:start position:0%
where I used to just we would all sit at
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
the far in one end the committee room
 
01:11:43.990 --> 01:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
and okay so just have a take yes
 
01:11:46.270 --> 01:11:46.280 align:start position:0%
representative spear has a question when
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
we when last we spoke about this bill uh
 
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
the funding mechanism
 
01:11:58.229 --> 01:11:58.239 align:start position:0%
was the the taxes that are paid on the
 
01:12:00.669 --> 01:12:00.679 align:start position:0%
licenses is my understanding I could be
 
01:12:02.669 --> 01:12:02.679 align:start position:0%
totally wrong the taxes that were paid
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
on the licenses would fund this this
 
01:12:06.750 --> 01:12:06.760 align:start position:0%
program and now you're talking about an
 
01:12:08.229 --> 01:12:08.239 align:start position:0%
assessment can you explain what the
 
01:12:10.430 --> 01:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
difference is sure
 
01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:11.950 align:start position:0%
difference is sure
so

01:12:11.950 --> 01:12:11.960 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:12:15.350 --> 01:12:15.360 align:start position:0%
again as we thought about this program
 
01:12:17.870 --> 01:12:17.880 align:start position:0%
we discussed a couple of different ways
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
to approach the funding of it initially
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
my preferred funding source was what the
 
01:12:27.310 --> 01:12:27.320 align:start position:0%
state of Oklahoma does so the state of
 
01:12:31.590 --> 01:12:31.600 align:start position:0%
Oklahoma takes all of the licensing fees
 
01:12:35.070 --> 01:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
registration fees that they collect for
 
01:12:37.870 --> 01:12:37.880 align:start position:0%
Surplus lines companies and they put it
 
01:12:40.910 --> 01:12:40.920 align:start position:0%
into the fund that's become their direct
 
01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:43.800 align:start position:0%
Revenue source for their program and I
 
01:12:47.030 --> 01:12:47.040 align:start position:0%
said that sounds pretty good to me until
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
I found out that in New Hampshire we
 
01:12:53.510 --> 01:12:53.520 align:start position:0%
only generate about $38,000 worth of
 
01:12:54.870 --> 01:12:54.880 align:start position:0%
registrations for Surplus lines
 
01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.550 align:start position:0%
registrations for Surplus lines
companies

01:12:56.550 --> 01:12:56.560 align:start position:0%
companies
 
01:12:58.510 --> 01:12:58.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to get very far with this
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
program with $38,000 so it forced us to
 
01:13:05.189 --> 01:13:05.199 align:start position:0%
have to consider a different
 
01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:07.360 align:start position:0%
option and we went through a couple of
 
01:13:10.430 --> 01:13:10.440 align:start position:0%
different options we appreciated the
 
01:13:12.030 --> 01:13:12.040 align:start position:0%
fact that some of those options were
 
01:13:14.189 --> 01:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
going to touch a nerve for industry we
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to see if we could thread the
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
needle to get everybody on board so I
 
01:13:22.709 --> 01:13:22.719 align:start position:0%
said look we will come out of the gate
 
01:13:25.709 --> 01:13:25.719 align:start position:0%
to with a proposal that will let us
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
retain the first million dollars ofe of
 
01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:29.760 align:start position:0%
insurance premium tax revenue that we
 
01:13:32.750 --> 01:13:32.760 align:start position:0%
collect and put that into the
 
01:13:35.390 --> 01:13:35.400 align:start position:0%
fund industry I I don't want to speak
 
01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:36.920 align:start position:0%
for them they could speak for themselves
 
01:13:38.510 --> 01:13:38.520 align:start position:0%
my understanding was the industry was
 
01:13:40.110 --> 01:13:40.120 align:start position:0%
fine with that
 
01:13:42.510 --> 01:13:42.520 align:start position:0%
approach then as I've said who was not
 
01:13:44.229 --> 01:13:44.239 align:start position:0%
fine with that approach was house
 
01:13:45.470 --> 01:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
finance division
 
01:13:48.430 --> 01:13:48.440 align:start position:0%
one and I understand why I understand
 
01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:50.600 align:start position:0%
the challenge you guys are going through
 
01:13:53.149 --> 01:13:53.159 align:start position:0%
so based off of their conversation about
 
01:13:55.830 --> 01:13:55.840 align:start position:0%
this now has come forward this proposal
 
01:13:59.390 --> 01:13:59.400 align:start position:0%
so to your I directly to your
 
01:14:01.950 --> 01:14:01.960 align:start position:0%
question again when we first started it
 
01:14:05.669 --> 01:14:05.679 align:start position:0%
was million dollar of Ip into the fund
 
01:14:05.679 --> 01:14:07.310 align:start position:0%
was million dollar of Ip into the fund
that's

01:14:07.310 --> 01:14:07.320 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:14:09.590 --> 01:14:09.600 align:start position:0%
straightforward that wasn't available
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
you guys need the million dollars for
 
01:14:14.910 --> 01:14:14.920 align:start position:0%
the things so the assessment piece of it
 
01:14:17.470 --> 01:14:17.480 align:start position:0%
is again how the department is funded
 
01:14:18.790 --> 01:14:18.800 align:start position:0%
we're self-funded
 
01:14:22.669 --> 01:14:22.679 align:start position:0%
agency so we take the total amount of
 
01:14:24.390 --> 01:14:24.400 align:start position:0%
the Department's budget what we're fully
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
allowed to to spend for that particular
 
01:14:29.470 --> 01:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
fiscal year so it's somewhere in the
 
01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
neighborhood of 15
 
01:14:34.709 --> 01:14:34.719 align:start position:0%
million this that we're proposing for
 
01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:36.800 align:start position:0%
the budget that's currently under
 
01:14:39.470 --> 01:14:39.480 align:start position:0%
consideration um so that's what's going
 
01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:41.360 align:start position:0%
to go out it'll go through that formula
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
per capita written premium for that
 
01:14:45.750 --> 01:14:45.760 align:start position:0%
company the check comes in there it is
 
01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:48.280 align:start position:0%
and so what we're saying is if we don't
 
01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:50.760 align:start position:0%
spend a 15 million the full amount that
 
01:14:52.990 --> 01:14:53.000 align:start position:0%
we've been authorized to spend we can
 
01:14:55.750 --> 01:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
retain up to a million dollar of
 
01:14:59.669 --> 01:14:59.679 align:start position:0%
that and fund the program that way which
 
01:15:02.790 --> 01:15:02.800 align:start position:0%
is a stable funding mechanism going
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
forward yes the amount might change I
 
01:15:08.030 --> 01:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
don't really think we'd ever get below a
 
01:15:09.870 --> 01:15:09.880 align:start position:0%
million but I'm not going to be
 
01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.950 align:start position:0%
million but I'm not going to be
commissioner

01:15:10.950 --> 01:15:10.960 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
01:15:14.229 --> 01:15:14.239 align:start position:0%
forever um but the other benefit is it
 
01:15:17.590 --> 01:15:17.600 align:start position:0%
does not have to go through the budget
 
01:15:20.669 --> 01:15:20.679 align:start position:0%
process every other year and have to be
 
01:15:22.149 --> 01:15:22.159 align:start position:0%
weighed against all of the other
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
priorities that you have to consider but
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
what is the term assessment mean in this
 
01:15:29.430 --> 01:15:29.440 align:start position:0%
context the word assessment what you
 
01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:31.480 align:start position:0%
assess it we're assessing the insurance
 
01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:33.760 align:start position:0%
companies who do business in the okay
 
01:15:36.629 --> 01:15:36.639 align:start position:0%
yeah uh I've done a Lely job of
 
01:15:39.070 --> 01:15:39.080 align:start position:0%
explaining this now two weeks in a row
 
01:15:41.950 --> 01:15:41.960 align:start position:0%
she's a little new no no no fine he all
 
01:15:44.790 --> 01:15:44.800 align:start position:0%
this is what this is your second term
 
01:15:46.870 --> 01:15:46.880 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't what the word assessment
 
01:15:49.510 --> 01:15:49.520 align:start position:0%
exactly go for
 
01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:55.360 align:start position:0%
it so so anyways um Vermont
 
01:15:58.229 --> 01:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh they pay for the insurance department
 
01:16:00.110 --> 01:16:00.120 align:start position:0%
out of the general
 
01:16:03.350 --> 01:16:03.360 align:start position:0%
funds okay the all expenses to pay for
 
01:16:06.709 --> 01:16:06.719 align:start position:0%
all employees pay for everything okay uh
 
01:16:08.149 --> 01:16:08.159 align:start position:0%
and and they do that for insurance and
 
01:16:11.189 --> 01:16:11.199 align:start position:0%
banking too okay we we don't do it that
 
01:16:13.070 --> 01:16:13.080 align:start position:0%
way here in New Hampshire and here in
 
01:16:17.510 --> 01:16:17.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire um we uh expect the users
 
01:16:19.790 --> 01:16:19.800 align:start position:0%
of a department like the insurance
 
01:16:21.790 --> 01:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
companies like the insurance companies
 
01:16:24.550 --> 01:16:24.560 align:start position:0%
or like the banks with the bank the bank
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
the users to pay for the Departments I
 
01:16:32.270 --> 01:16:32.280 align:start position:0%
see and so the assessment system is
 
01:16:34.270 --> 01:16:34.280 align:start position:0%
created uh and it when he was talking
 
01:16:36.070 --> 01:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
about how have rocket Sciences figure
 
01:16:38.669 --> 01:16:38.679 align:start position:0%
this out like you okay because there's
 
01:16:40.629 --> 01:16:40.639 align:start position:0%
lots of little formulas it's like the
 
01:16:42.629 --> 01:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
Dow Jones you know when you come in and
 
01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
it's a different number you know and
 
01:16:46.149 --> 01:16:46.159 align:start position:0%
it's it complicated because it's based
 
01:16:50.189 --> 01:16:50.199 align:start position:0%
upon a the type of Industry okay and and
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
you know whether it's Property and
 
01:16:52.709 --> 01:16:52.719 align:start position:0%
Casualty versus health insurance that
 
01:16:55.070 --> 01:16:55.080 align:start position:0%
each one's different okay and that we
 
01:16:57.229 --> 01:16:57.239 align:start position:0%
have an assessment system that we make
 
01:16:59.830 --> 01:16:59.840 align:start position:0%
anybody who is a domestic insurance
 
01:17:03.350 --> 01:17:03.360 align:start position:0%
company um pay the Lion Share we
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
definitely try to get all the other
 
01:17:06.669 --> 01:17:06.679 align:start position:0%
property and casual companies that
 
01:17:09.110 --> 01:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
participate in our state and we're very
 
01:17:11.750 --> 01:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
have a very Lively property and casually
 
01:17:14.229 --> 01:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
don't have mandatory Auto okay so we we
 
01:17:15.910 --> 01:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
have a good Market a lot of companies
 
01:17:18.750 --> 01:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
that come in and do business um uh they
 
01:17:20.830 --> 01:17:20.840 align:start position:0%
pay you know they pay they get their
 
01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
assess everybody gets assessed to help
 
01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
Finance the department so that's what
 
01:17:26.590 --> 01:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
he's talking about but that that is we
 
01:17:28.229 --> 01:17:28.239 align:start position:0%
have to be proactive we have to assess
 
01:17:31.950 --> 01:17:31.960 align:start position:0%
them first based upon our budget but
 
01:17:33.790 --> 01:17:33.800 align:start position:0%
then when all said and done after the
 
01:17:35.629 --> 01:17:35.639 align:start position:0%
year is over there could be employees we
 
01:17:37.669 --> 01:17:37.679 align:start position:0%
didn't field jobs didn't happen
 
01:17:38.669 --> 01:17:38.679 align:start position:0%
different things that could have
 
01:17:40.950 --> 01:17:40.960 align:start position:0%
happened in terms of that year and
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
that's why there's often a surplus and
 
01:17:45.350 --> 01:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
that's where that's what we're tapping
 
01:17:48.550 --> 01:17:48.560 align:start position:0%
in is that Surplus um normally would be
 
01:17:51.030 --> 01:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
just give apply to payments for next
 
01:17:53.310 --> 01:17:53.320 align:start position:0%
year for those in companies but that
 
01:17:54.470 --> 01:17:54.480 align:start position:0%
we're saying let's we're going to carve
 
01:17:56.590 --> 01:17:56.600 align:start position:0%
out a a little bit to help this property
 
01:17:58.910 --> 01:17:58.920 align:start position:0%
and casually
 
01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
industry neita thank you I just have a
 
01:18:03.550 --> 01:18:03.560 align:start position:0%
quick question commissioner can't see
 
01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:05.750 align:start position:0%
quick question commissioner can't see
you

01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:18:10.189 --> 01:18:10.199 align:start position:0%
um I'm sorry um you me you sighting here
 
01:18:12.149 --> 01:18:12.159 align:start position:0%
you know sounds like the possibility of
 
01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:13.920 align:start position:0%
federal grants or money I assume that's
 
01:18:16.550 --> 01:18:16.560 align:start position:0%
close to nil possibility at this point I
 
01:18:18.430 --> 01:18:18.440 align:start position:0%
would never dare to predict what's going
 
01:18:20.910 --> 01:18:20.920 align:start position:0%
to happen in Washington I think we can
 
01:18:22.590 --> 01:18:22.600 align:start position:0%
right now so that's it's in the bill
 
01:18:24.910 --> 01:18:24.920 align:start position:0%
simply that if there if there was then
 
01:18:26.390 --> 01:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to come back they
 
01:18:27.550 --> 01:18:27.560 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to have to come back and
 
01:18:30.149 --> 01:18:30.159 align:start position:0%
ask permission take the money there has
 
01:18:33.030 --> 01:18:33.040 align:start position:0%
been conversation about the federal
 
01:18:34.950 --> 01:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
government making grants available to
 
01:18:36.950 --> 01:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
States for either the promotion of these
 
01:18:40.870 --> 01:18:40.880 align:start position:0%
programs or to uh help supplement the
 
01:18:43.990 --> 01:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
state funding and I think it would be a
 
01:18:46.669 --> 01:18:46.679 align:start position:0%
great thing uh if the federal government
 
01:18:48.950 --> 01:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
were to make those grants available we
 
01:18:51.030 --> 01:18:51.040 align:start position:0%
would obviously be able to expand the
 
01:18:52.430 --> 01:18:52.440 align:start position:0%
number of people that we would be able
 
01:18:55.709 --> 01:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
to help the key question would be Beyond
 
01:18:57.189 --> 01:18:57.199 align:start position:0%
whether or not it was actually ever made
 
01:18:59.350 --> 01:18:59.360 align:start position:0%
available the other key question would
 
01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
be how many strings do they attach to
 
01:19:04.950 --> 01:19:04.960 align:start position:0%
those dollars and would that work within
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
the constructs of our program now and if
 
01:19:11.229 --> 01:19:11.239 align:start position:0%
the strings were common sense but it
 
01:19:12.830 --> 01:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
still didn't quite fit right I would
 
01:19:14.830 --> 01:19:14.840 align:start position:0%
come to you and say we need to make a
 
01:19:16.830 --> 01:19:16.840 align:start position:0%
couple of tweaks here so we can get
 
01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:20.840 align:start position:0%
these federal dollars in but if it's too
 
01:19:22.950 --> 01:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
overwhelming we may not be able to make
 
01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
use of it so when I've talked with our
 
01:19:28.390 --> 01:19:28.400 align:start position:0%
federal delegation about this I've said
 
01:19:30.189 --> 01:19:30.199 align:start position:0%
to them I think those grants could be
 
01:19:33.470 --> 01:19:33.480 align:start position:0%
very helpful to States I absolutely
 
01:19:35.110 --> 01:19:35.120 align:start position:0%
believe in the benefit that it could
 
01:19:38.629 --> 01:19:38.639 align:start position:0%
provide to Consumers but please as you
 
01:19:41.830 --> 01:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
make those grants available do not make
 
01:19:43.590 --> 01:19:43.600 align:start position:0%
the requirements around them so
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
prescriptive that they don't fit or
 
01:19:49.189 --> 01:19:49.199 align:start position:0%
can't work within how each state has
 
01:19:52.430 --> 01:19:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:55.920 align:start position:0%
program okay well get to you George I
 
01:19:57.510 --> 01:19:57.520 align:start position:0%
promise that's all
 
01:20:00.790 --> 01:20:00.800 align:start position:0%
right represent brail thank you so I
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
I've been trying to research the direct
 
01:20:06.950 --> 01:20:06.960 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the program is to lower
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
Insurance costs for property owners
 
01:20:11.830 --> 01:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
right property insurance and I've been
 
01:20:13.390 --> 01:20:13.400 align:start position:0%
trying to resar no it's not it's not
 
01:20:16.870 --> 01:20:16.880 align:start position:0%
lowering but this is what this is is is
 
01:20:19.669 --> 01:20:19.679 align:start position:0%
preemptive no I understand that he's
 
01:20:22.030 --> 01:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
trying to get the rates to come down is
 
01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:24.159 align:start position:0%
what I've been hearing yes yes if I if I
 
01:20:26.510 --> 01:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
might so not seeing the connection
 
01:20:29.669 --> 01:20:29.679 align:start position:0%
between cutting my trees down and right
 
01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:32.760 align:start position:0%
I might not have a claim for that and
 
01:20:35.629 --> 01:20:35.639 align:start position:0%
having insurance rates maybe be a little
 
01:20:37.669 --> 01:20:37.679 align:start position:0%
bit more competitive sure so let me
 
01:20:39.070 --> 01:20:39.080 align:start position:0%
explain how this would work because
 
01:20:40.950 --> 01:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
representative Hunt's right this is a
 
01:20:43.870 --> 01:20:43.880 align:start position:0%
prospective looking program not anything
 
01:20:47.110 --> 01:20:47.120 align:start position:0%
that would be later or post event those
 
01:20:48.750 --> 01:20:48.760 align:start position:0%
would be things that FEMA would get
 
01:20:51.310 --> 01:20:51.320 align:start position:0%
involved with the way this program is
 
01:20:53.790 --> 01:20:53.800 align:start position:0%
structured is when you are getting a
 
01:20:56.270 --> 01:20:56.280 align:start position:0%
quote for a homeowner insurance policy
 
01:20:58.390 --> 01:20:58.400 align:start position:0%
or when you've come up for renewal for
 
01:21:00.830 --> 01:21:00.840 align:start position:0%
your current homeowners insurance policy
 
01:21:01.950 --> 01:21:01.960 align:start position:0%
they're going to put you through an
 
01:21:04.149 --> 01:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
underwriting process each company has
 
01:21:07.149 --> 01:21:07.159 align:start position:0%
their own underwriting factors those get
 
01:21:08.870 --> 01:21:08.880 align:start position:0%
looked at by the department to make sure
 
01:21:10.910 --> 01:21:10.920 align:start position:0%
they're not discriminatory or anything
 
01:21:13.149 --> 01:21:13.159 align:start position:0%
of that nature and
 
01:21:15.430 --> 01:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
so they'll look at your property or
 
01:21:16.910 --> 01:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
they'll take an aial photo of your
 
01:21:20.550 --> 01:21:20.560 align:start position:0%
property and they'll plug what they
 
01:21:23.790 --> 01:21:23.800 align:start position:0%
see into their underwriting formula and
 
01:21:26.430 --> 01:21:26.440 align:start position:0%
then it will spit out what your premium
 
01:21:28.510 --> 01:21:28.520 align:start position:0%
should be and there are things like
 
01:21:30.310 --> 01:21:30.320 align:start position:0%
value of the home there's a number of
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
different components but some of the
 
01:21:35.310 --> 01:21:35.320 align:start position:0%
components that we've heard as of late
 
01:21:37.510 --> 01:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
that have driven a lot of premiums
 
01:21:39.669 --> 01:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
upward are things related to the
 
01:21:41.830 --> 01:21:41.840 align:start position:0%
property or the external part of the
 
01:21:44.510 --> 01:21:44.520 align:start position:0%
house roofs those trees I was speaking
 
01:21:46.830 --> 01:21:46.840 align:start position:0%
of being able to shore up the foundation
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
to guard against flood and so what the
 
01:21:52.950 --> 01:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
program is designed to do is to speak to
 
01:21:55.430 --> 01:21:55.440 align:start position:0%
those underwriting guidelines so the
 
01:21:57.149 --> 01:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
eligibility of what you can use your
 
01:22:00.990 --> 01:22:01.000 align:start position:0%
funds for is directly tied to an
 
01:22:04.030 --> 01:22:04.040 align:start position:0%
underwriting factor and so when you come
 
01:22:05.189 --> 01:22:05.199 align:start position:0%
up for
 
01:22:07.510 --> 01:22:07.520 align:start position:0%
Renewal you're going to be in a better
 
01:22:09.229 --> 01:22:09.239 align:start position:0%
position if you've fixed the roof if
 
01:22:12.229 --> 01:22:12.239 align:start position:0%
you've done whatever needs to be done
 
01:22:13.669 --> 01:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
because you're going to feare better in
 
01:22:16.149 --> 01:22:16.159 align:start position:0%
that underwriting process and so your
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
premium in in um ideally would come
 
01:22:23.750 --> 01:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
would come down but at worst our hope is
 
01:22:26.189 --> 01:22:26.199 align:start position:0%
that it will prevent you from not
 
01:22:26.199 --> 01:22:27.830 align:start position:0%
that it will prevent you from not
getting

01:22:27.830 --> 01:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
getting
 
01:22:32.950 --> 01:22:32.960 align:start position:0%
non-renewed and having to go try to get
 
01:22:34.510 --> 01:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
coverage through the Surplus lines
 
01:22:37.910 --> 01:22:37.920 align:start position:0%
Market which is very very
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
expensive does that hopefully answer
 
01:22:40.320 --> 01:22:46.270 align:start position:0%
expensive does that hopefully answer
your

01:22:46.270 --> 01:22:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:49.669 --> 01:22:49.679 align:start position:0%
question well this I well yeah here's
 
01:22:51.350 --> 01:22:51.360 align:start position:0%
I'll give a story you you know me I love
 
01:22:55.510 --> 01:22:55.520 align:start position:0%
stories okay so let's say
 
01:22:58.030 --> 01:22:58.040 align:start position:0%
um you your uh your company the
 
01:22:59.790 --> 01:22:59.800 align:start position:0%
insurance company says we would like to
 
01:23:01.950 --> 01:23:01.960 align:start position:0%
do visit you want to come check it
 
01:23:07.110 --> 01:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
out and and you're there you you see the
 
01:23:09.030 --> 01:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
the guy is coming in and and looking at
 
01:23:10.990 --> 01:23:11.000 align:start position:0%
it over and he's got his clipboard and
 
01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:13.440 align:start position:0%
he's checking these things up and then
 
01:23:16.750 --> 01:23:16.760 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden he looks
 
01:23:20.830 --> 01:23:20.840 align:start position:0%
up and you you have your your children
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
they're they're on a swing under one of
 
01:23:24.550 --> 01:23:24.560 align:start position:0%
the limbs of this tree swinging back
 
01:23:26.709 --> 01:23:26.719 align:start position:0%
back and forth and he looks
 
01:23:32.030 --> 01:23:32.040 align:start position:0%
up and he says that's a very big
 
01:23:34.110 --> 01:23:34.120 align:start position:0%
tree and then write something down on
 
01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:34.910 align:start position:0%
tree and then write something down on
his

01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
his
 
01:23:39.030 --> 01:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
board and you your first instinct is he
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't like that
 
01:23:44.149 --> 01:23:44.159 align:start position:0%
tree and that he might when it comes
 
01:23:46.590 --> 01:23:46.600 align:start position:0%
time to set your
 
01:23:46.600 --> 01:23:48.510 align:start position:0%
time to set your
rate

01:23:48.510 --> 01:23:48.520 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:23:51.629 --> 01:23:51.639 align:start position:0%
Say it'll be a little higher because
 
01:23:54.709 --> 01:23:54.719 align:start position:0%
they see a risk there
 
01:23:56.669 --> 01:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
so what this bill would say
 
01:23:59.510 --> 01:23:59.520 align:start position:0%
is now now obviously this is not set I
 
01:24:00.910 --> 01:24:00.920 align:start position:0%
mean there's not I don't think you ever
 
01:24:02.790 --> 01:24:02.800 align:start position:0%
get a letter that say cut that tree down
 
01:24:05.470 --> 01:24:05.480 align:start position:0%
or we're not going to you know give you
 
01:24:07.830 --> 01:24:07.840 align:start position:0%
Jance but but he just you just sense
 
01:24:10.189 --> 01:24:10.199 align:start position:0%
that you know I I know that tree is a
 
01:24:12.350 --> 01:24:12.360 align:start position:0%
problem and but I never dealt with the
 
01:24:13.830 --> 01:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
tree because it's going to cost me 10
 
01:24:15.910 --> 01:24:15.920 align:start position:0%
grand to take it down because he have to
 
01:24:17.669 --> 01:24:17.679 align:start position:0%
come over with this big Crane and pull
 
01:24:19.750 --> 01:24:19.760 align:start position:0%
each limb off
 
01:24:22.790 --> 01:24:22.800 align:start position:0%
separately and so this is a program in
 
01:24:23.950 --> 01:24:23.960 align:start position:0%
which the New Hampshire insurance
 
01:24:35.149 --> 01:24:35.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:37.550 --> 01:24:37.560 align:start position:0%
you all right
 
01:24:41.070 --> 01:24:41.080 align:start position:0%
so say is every time I get a new
 
01:24:43.390 --> 01:24:43.400 align:start position:0%
insurance policy and I've had a couple
 
01:24:46.189 --> 01:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
I've had I had this thing come out and
 
01:24:48.629 --> 01:24:48.639 align:start position:0%
and and one of them came out and
 
01:24:52.590 --> 01:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
said you have two dogs I said yeah I got
 
01:24:57.950 --> 01:24:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:06.669 --> 01:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
me this sorry get rid of the dogs yeah
 
01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
we're not expanding criteria to get rid
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
of docks
 
01:25:18.270 --> 01:25:18.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
um we gave back $2.6 Million last year
 
01:25:25.750 --> 01:25:25.760 align:start position:0%
so they'd still be getting back one
 
01:25:27.149 --> 01:25:27.159 align:start position:0%
under that scenario they'd still get
 
01:25:27.159 --> 01:25:28.270 align:start position:0%
under that scenario they'd still get
back

01:25:28.270 --> 01:25:28.280 align:start position:0%
back
 
01:25:30.189 --> 01:25:30.199 align:start position:0%
1.6 um and the other thing that to
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
represent pelli a lot of a lot of times
 
01:25:34.510 --> 01:25:34.520 align:start position:0%
the reason you don't see somebody in
 
01:25:36.229 --> 01:25:36.239 align:start position:0%
person coming out is there's been a
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
greater Reliance on aerial photography
 
01:25:41.310 --> 01:25:41.320 align:start position:0%
from companies which brings with it
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
efficiency not having to bother you we
 
01:25:45.950 --> 01:25:45.960 align:start position:0%
sometimes run into some challenges with
 
01:25:48.270 --> 01:25:48.280 align:start position:0%
accuracy of the photos we had a a
 
01:25:50.790 --> 01:25:50.800 align:start position:0%
consumer quite perplexed that they were
 
01:25:52.629 --> 01:25:52.639 align:start position:0%
non-renewed based on the condition of
 
01:25:54.510 --> 01:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
their property in the photo they got of
 
01:25:55.870 --> 01:25:55.880 align:start position:0%
their neighbors
 
01:25:58.350 --> 01:25:58.360 align:start position:0%
property right so we had to do a little
 
01:26:00.070 --> 01:26:00.080 align:start position:0%
Outreach to the company to say you got
 
01:26:02.830 --> 01:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
the wrong house uh but that may be one
 
01:26:04.189 --> 01:26:04.199 align:start position:0%
of the reasons you don't see that would
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
not be one of our New Hampshire
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
domestics right George
 
01:26:09.990 --> 01:26:10.000 align:start position:0%
possibly okay George tell us what's
 
01:26:12.189 --> 01:26:12.199 align:start position:0%
wrong what what your issues are and
 
01:26:14.229 --> 01:26:14.239 align:start position:0%
whether we can fix than I think I know
 
01:26:16.229 --> 01:26:16.239 align:start position:0%
all all of you because I've I've been
 
01:26:18.590 --> 01:26:18.600 align:start position:0%
testifying but George Russo is my name
 
01:26:20.669 --> 01:26:20.679 align:start position:0%
I'm a lawyer in conquered and I
 
01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:22.600 align:start position:0%
represent different Insurance
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
associations along with my partner
 
01:26:27.070 --> 01:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
lindsy NATO who has also testified I
 
01:26:29.910 --> 01:26:29.920 align:start position:0%
think before you and
 
01:26:32.950 --> 01:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
so when we first heard about this
 
01:26:35.109 --> 01:26:35.119 align:start position:0%
initiative from the commissioner several
 
01:26:37.350 --> 01:26:37.360 align:start position:0%
months ago speak close to the mic I'm
 
01:26:40.109 --> 01:26:40.119 align:start position:0%
sorry just pull the mic there you
 
01:26:45.830 --> 01:26:45.840 align:start position:0%
go uh our first concern was uh
 
01:26:48.470 --> 01:26:48.480 align:start position:0%
funding uh because it seems a natural
 
01:26:51.790 --> 01:26:51.800 align:start position:0%
thing to say well uh here's the program
 
01:26:54.590 --> 01:26:54.600 align:start position:0%
and it's going to be funded by let's say
 
01:26:57.109 --> 01:26:57.119 align:start position:0%
existing premium tax dollars which was
 
01:26:59.950 --> 01:26:59.960 align:start position:0%
the way this bill was originally
 
01:27:02.149 --> 01:27:02.159 align:start position:0%
drafted and say well wait a minute why
 
01:27:04.790 --> 01:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
don't we just raise new money from the
 
01:27:07.590 --> 01:27:07.600 align:start position:0%
insurance companies instead of having a
 
01:27:10.550 --> 01:27:10.560 align:start position:0%
million dollars Less in into the general
 
01:27:15.229 --> 01:27:15.239 align:start position:0%
fund uh and so that risk was Paramount
 
01:27:17.070 --> 01:27:17.080 align:start position:0%
and we expressed it to the
 
01:27:20.270 --> 01:27:20.280 align:start position:0%
commissioner um and as the commissioner
 
01:27:23.310 --> 01:27:23.320 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh we had no objection to the
 
01:27:25.149 --> 01:27:25.159 align:start position:0%
original a
 
01:27:28.950 --> 01:27:28.960 align:start position:0%
bill um but again very concerned about
 
01:27:32.189 --> 01:27:32.199 align:start position:0%
the funding so sure enough what happened
 
01:27:33.910 --> 01:27:33.920 align:start position:0%
as the commissioner outlined is he went
 
01:27:36.669 --> 01:27:36.679 align:start position:0%
before finance and they said well this
 
01:27:38.149 --> 01:27:38.159 align:start position:0%
bill is going to cost the state a
 
01:27:40.790 --> 01:27:40.800 align:start position:0%
million dollars that it that it
 
01:27:45.310 --> 01:27:45.320 align:start position:0%
evidently we don't have right so uh so
 
01:27:47.550 --> 01:27:47.560 align:start position:0%
here we are and I want to thank the
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
commissioner he's been uh great at uh
 
01:27:52.750 --> 01:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
working with us communicating with us on
 
01:27:56.990 --> 01:27:57.000 align:start position:0%
on this uh and other issues as well and
 
01:28:00.910 --> 01:28:00.920 align:start position:0%
we almost always uh find agreement on
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
matters of public policy and here the
 
01:28:07.430 --> 01:28:07.440 align:start position:0%
commissioner let us know about the uh
 
01:28:12.470 --> 01:28:12.480 align:start position:0%
his his uh hearing meeting with finance
 
01:28:14.629 --> 01:28:14.639 align:start position:0%
and and and the prospect that they're
 
01:28:17.870 --> 01:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
looking for funds uh so here we are we
 
01:28:20.950 --> 01:28:20.960 align:start position:0%
sent it around yesterday afternoon and
 
01:28:23.390 --> 01:28:23.400 align:start position:0%
we've gotten a lot of feedback between
 
01:28:25.189 --> 01:28:25.199 align:start position:0%
yesterday afternoon afterno and now from
 
01:28:27.590 --> 01:28:27.600 align:start position:0%
companies expressing
 
01:28:31.669 --> 01:28:31.679 align:start position:0%
concerns um I'd like to First mention um
 
01:28:34.990 --> 01:28:35.000 align:start position:0%
so we're clear about the taxes and fees
 
01:28:37.070 --> 01:28:37.080 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies pay currently
 
01:28:39.390 --> 01:28:39.400 align:start position:0%
to the state of New Hampshire there's a
 
01:28:42.950 --> 01:28:42.960 align:start position:0%
premium tax that varies from 1.25 to 2%
 
01:28:47.550 --> 01:28:47.560 align:start position:0%
of gross premium that is paid before
 
01:28:51.109 --> 01:28:51.119 align:start position:0%
that insurance companies pay a bet the
 
01:28:54.189 --> 01:28:54.199 align:start position:0%
business Enterprise tax
 
01:28:56.910 --> 01:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
then it they they pay the premium tax
 
01:28:58.830 --> 01:28:58.840 align:start position:0%
with a credit against the
 
01:29:02.870 --> 01:29:02.880 align:start position:0%
BET and then a business profits tax to
 
01:29:06.790 --> 01:29:06.800 align:start position:0%
the extent that the premium tax uh is uh
 
01:29:09.629 --> 01:29:09.639 align:start position:0%
less than the BPT so they pay the higher
 
01:29:12.030 --> 01:29:12.040 align:start position:0%
of the business taxes that businesses
 
01:29:15.990 --> 01:29:16.000 align:start position:0%
pay uh and the insurance premium tax in
 
01:29:18.629 --> 01:29:18.639 align:start position:0%
addition to that as the commissioner
 
01:29:21.870 --> 01:29:21.880 align:start position:0%
mentioned uh insurance companies fund by
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
assessment the budget of the insurance
 
01:29:29.510 --> 01:29:29.520 align:start position:0%
department um that budget is roughly $10
 
01:29:34.390 --> 01:29:34.400 align:start position:0%
million uh it it keeps going up but um
 
01:29:37.950 --> 01:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
around that amount of money um we're one
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
of only I think about seven
 
01:29:44.750 --> 01:29:44.760 align:start position:0%
states that fund the department uh by
 
01:29:47.109 --> 01:29:47.119 align:start position:0%
assessment rather than through general
 
01:29:49.830 --> 01:29:49.840 align:start position:0%
fund that number may change I haven't
 
01:29:52.189 --> 01:29:52.199 align:start position:0%
checked in a long time but roughly that
 
01:29:55.750 --> 01:29:55.760 align:start position:0%
number a minority of states
 
01:29:55.760 --> 01:29:56.830 align:start position:0%
number a minority of states
in

01:29:56.830 --> 01:29:56.840 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:30:00.510 --> 01:30:00.520 align:start position:0%
addition uh insurance companies pay fees
 
01:30:02.550 --> 01:30:02.560 align:start position:0%
uh licensing fees and so forth to the
 
01:30:04.470 --> 01:30:04.480 align:start position:0%
department that again these are rough
 
01:30:06.229 --> 01:30:06.239 align:start position:0%
numbers but the last I knew was a couple
 
01:30:09.790 --> 01:30:09.800 align:start position:0%
$1,000 a year to the department for its
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
services even though those services are
 
01:30:14.109 --> 01:30:14.119 align:start position:0%
already paid because the budget's fully
 
01:30:16.350 --> 01:30:16.360 align:start position:0%
paid for by the
 
01:30:19.229 --> 01:30:19.239 align:start position:0%
Assessments in addition insurance
 
01:30:21.590 --> 01:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
companies uh fund the workers comp
 
01:30:24.629 --> 01:30:24.639 align:start position:0%
division of the Department of Labor
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:30:28.510 --> 01:30:28.520 align:start position:0%
so uh it is
 
01:30:32.270 --> 01:30:32.280 align:start position:0%
a highly taxed to begin with compared to
 
01:30:32.280 --> 01:30:33.750 align:start position:0%
a highly taxed to begin with compared to
most

01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
most
 
01:30:33.760 --> 01:30:35.350 align:start position:0%
most
corporations

01:30:35.350 --> 01:30:35.360 align:start position:0%
corporations
 
01:30:40.229 --> 01:30:40.239 align:start position:0%
um this bill is a new tax of a million
 
01:30:43.430 --> 01:30:43.440 align:start position:0%
dollars well that you just killed it
 
01:30:44.590 --> 01:30:44.600 align:start position:0%
well that's what it
 
01:30:50.430 --> 01:30:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:52.629 --> 01:30:52.639 align:start position:0%
it George and I always thought you were
 
01:30:59.669 --> 01:30:59.679 align:start position:0%
a nice guy I no I I I I uh we support
 
01:31:05.709 --> 01:31:05.719 align:start position:0%
this initiative um uh but uh uh it it to
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
to charge uh premium payers because
 
01:31:11.750 --> 01:31:11.760 align:start position:0%
that's where money to pay taxes and
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
everything else comes from uh for a
 
01:31:16.149 --> 01:31:16.159 align:start position:0%
program that
 
01:31:18.750 --> 01:31:18.760 align:start position:0%
benefits it doesn't benefit just
 
01:31:20.790 --> 01:31:20.800 align:start position:0%
insurance companies but it benefits the
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
general public that's that's really the
 
01:31:26.470 --> 01:31:26.480 align:start position:0%
reason for it is proove promote home
 
01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
safety um and by the way the assessments
 
01:31:31.669 --> 01:31:31.679 align:start position:0%
that would pay for it under this
 
01:31:34.709 --> 01:31:34.719 align:start position:0%
amendment uh apply to not just property
 
01:31:36.870 --> 01:31:36.880 align:start position:0%
Casualty Insurance companies but to life
 
01:31:39.629 --> 01:31:39.639 align:start position:0%
insurance companies and uh and and other
 
01:31:42.350 --> 01:31:42.360 align:start position:0%
companies uh hmos and so forth that pay
 
01:31:44.790 --> 01:31:44.800 align:start position:0%
the assessment uh is but isn't the
 
01:31:47.109 --> 01:31:47.119 align:start position:0%
assessment variable based upon which
 
01:31:50.350 --> 01:31:50.360 align:start position:0%
industry it is no this the premium tax
 
01:31:54.750 --> 01:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
is but the the assessment is is you take
 
01:31:57.270 --> 01:31:57.280 align:start position:0%
as a denominator the the total premium
 
01:31:59.510 --> 01:31:59.520 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and then the numerator
 
01:32:02.470 --> 01:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
is is the individual companies premium
 
01:32:05.030 --> 01:32:05.040 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire oh how much they do B
 
01:32:06.870 --> 01:32:06.880 align:start position:0%
business ecomic business they do in the
 
01:32:10.590 --> 01:32:10.600 align:start position:0%
state that's correct that's correct so
 
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:14.040 align:start position:0%
uh this struck a sensitive uh uh nerve
 
01:32:17.310 --> 01:32:17.320 align:start position:0%
with insurance companies uh uh now you
 
01:32:20.270 --> 01:32:20.280 align:start position:0%
can say this isn't a tax it's it's an
 
01:32:23.030 --> 01:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
assessment which is a fee uh to pay the
 
01:32:24.709 --> 01:32:24.719 align:start position:0%
budget of the insurance department but a
 
01:32:26.709 --> 01:32:26.719 align:start position:0%
fee as you know has to be
 
01:32:28.709 --> 01:32:28.719 align:start position:0%
constitutionally has to be related to
 
01:32:32.590 --> 01:32:32.600 align:start position:0%
the cost of the services being provided
 
01:32:35.590 --> 01:32:35.600 align:start position:0%
and here there's no relationship between
 
01:32:38.229 --> 01:32:38.239 align:start position:0%
the home resiliency program and and the
 
01:32:41.229 --> 01:32:41.239 align:start position:0%
fees so it's either an illegal fee or or
 
01:32:43.270 --> 01:32:43.280 align:start position:0%
a new tax depending upon how you
 
01:32:46.270 --> 01:32:46.280 align:start position:0%
characterize it so you say it's a
 
01:32:49.590 --> 01:32:49.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars well uh it's a million
 
01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:50.669 align:start position:0%
million dollars well uh it's a million
dollars

01:32:50.669 --> 01:32:50.679 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:54.840 align:start position:0%
today that's fine uh
 
01:32:56.870 --> 01:32:56.880 align:start position:0%
what about other states now the this
 
01:32:59.310 --> 01:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
these initiatives are coming up in other
 
01:33:00.470 --> 01:33:00.480 align:start position:0%
states I think the commissioner
 
01:33:02.750 --> 01:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned six or seven states that have
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
a program similar to this one um and uh
 
01:33:12.229 --> 01:33:12.239 align:start position:0%
States talk to each other and if this is
 
01:33:14.510 --> 01:33:14.520 align:start position:0%
passed and and there's the word got out
 
01:33:17.270 --> 01:33:17.280 align:start position:0%
that we did this yeah then other states
 
01:33:18.990 --> 01:33:19.000 align:start position:0%
are going to be inclined to do the same
 
01:33:22.870 --> 01:33:22.880 align:start position:0%
thing so that's a concern in addition
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
this is gets a little complicated the in
 
01:33:27.550 --> 01:33:27.560 align:start position:0%
the world of
 
01:33:31.510 --> 01:33:31.520 align:start position:0%
Taxation uh pre reciprocal uh
 
01:33:35.189 --> 01:33:35.199 align:start position:0%
taxes uh are um yes only exist with
 
01:33:37.270 --> 01:33:37.280 align:start position:0%
respect to insurance and and the way
 
01:33:40.149 --> 01:33:40.159 align:start position:0%
that works is the states say if you
 
01:33:45.030 --> 01:33:45.040 align:start position:0%
charge a fee or a tax to our Indiana or
 
01:33:48.310 --> 01:33:48.320 align:start position:0%
Illinois company in New Hampshire we're
 
01:33:50.750 --> 01:33:50.760 align:start position:0%
going to charge that same fee and that
 
01:33:52.669 --> 01:33:52.679 align:start position:0%
same rate to your New Hampshire
 
01:33:55.950 --> 01:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
companies doing business in our state so
 
01:33:59.270 --> 01:33:59.280 align:start position:0%
it's a tit fortat situation and so a lot
 
01:34:03.470 --> 01:34:03.480 align:start position:0%
of times when these uh uh taxes and fees
 
01:34:06.590 --> 01:34:06.600 align:start position:0%
are uh implicated it not only costs the
 
01:34:08.510 --> 01:34:08.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars that we pay to New
 
01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:12.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but every other state has the
 
01:34:15.310 --> 01:34:15.320 align:start position:0%
ability to retaliate and and to charge
 
01:34:17.310 --> 01:34:17.320 align:start position:0%
us for the similar program as though
 
01:34:20.430 --> 01:34:20.440 align:start position:0%
they had a program in their state and so
 
01:34:24.870 --> 01:34:24.880 align:start position:0%
you multiply the the uh the exposure
 
01:34:27.430 --> 01:34:27.440 align:start position:0%
that a company has to uh retaliatory
 
01:34:29.830 --> 01:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
Insurance taxes that's another concern
 
01:34:32.229 --> 01:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
so yeah obviously you and I have been
 
01:34:35.350 --> 01:34:35.360 align:start position:0%
around yes this issue right because we
 
01:34:39.390 --> 01:34:39.400 align:start position:0%
we tried to lower the premium tax yes
 
01:34:42.030 --> 01:34:42.040 align:start position:0%
and what is our tax rate now it's a
 
01:34:44.950 --> 01:34:44.960 align:start position:0%
1.25% for property casualty companies
 
01:34:48.430 --> 01:34:48.440 align:start position:0%
it's 2% I believe for health uh and and
 
01:34:51.189 --> 01:34:51.199 align:start position:0%
life 2% was still they maintain the 2%
 
01:34:54.709 --> 01:34:54.719 align:start position:0%
we got the 1.2 so the fact is is that we
 
01:34:58.189 --> 01:34:58.199 align:start position:0%
could have uh that because of the
 
01:35:00.350 --> 01:35:00.360 align:start position:0%
reciprocality in terms of what what
 
01:35:03.830 --> 01:35:03.840 align:start position:0%
happens and that you know us the fact
 
01:35:06.229 --> 01:35:06.239 align:start position:0%
that we lowered our rate that had the
 
01:35:08.070 --> 01:35:08.080 align:start position:0%
effect of even for all those other
 
01:35:10.350 --> 01:35:10.360 align:start position:0%
companies who were doing business here
 
01:35:13.790 --> 01:35:13.800 align:start position:0%
so it has been a revenue decliner so if
 
01:35:15.709 --> 01:35:15.719 align:start position:0%
you were not sitting in this room but
 
01:35:19.070 --> 01:35:19.080 align:start position:0%
sitting over there in in ways and means
 
01:35:20.830 --> 01:35:20.840 align:start position:0%
you would say why in the hell did they
 
01:35:23.750 --> 01:35:23.760 align:start position:0%
lower the premium tax sure and look at
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
the implications so they would probably
 
01:35:28.750 --> 01:35:28.760 align:start position:0%
wouldn't take this bill lightly given
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
that we've already taken money out of
 
01:35:35.510 --> 01:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
their their pocket so to say and you we
 
01:35:39.350 --> 01:35:39.360 align:start position:0%
do go back this goes back to 2006 and uh
 
01:35:44.030 --> 01:35:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
you so it was a hard fun battle it it
 
01:35:49.430 --> 01:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
was that it was a hard I have a
 
01:35:51.990 --> 01:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
question to you said that because this
 
01:35:54.950 --> 01:35:54.960 align:start position:0%
is a fee I have two questions sure you
 
01:35:57.950 --> 01:35:57.960 align:start position:0%
could ask one yeah based on something
 
01:36:00.870 --> 01:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
you said yep you said because this is a
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
fee and it doesn't directly affect the
 
01:36:05.750 --> 01:36:05.760 align:start position:0%
business because it's homeowners and
 
01:36:08.910 --> 01:36:08.920 align:start position:0%
whatever and I question that if that
 
01:36:11.709 --> 01:36:11.719 align:start position:0%
tree falls on the house you have to pay
 
01:36:15.510 --> 01:36:15.520 align:start position:0%
out sure so this definitely mitigates
 
01:36:17.189 --> 01:36:17.199 align:start position:0%
future damage that you're going to have
 
01:36:20.030 --> 01:36:20.040 align:start position:0%
to pay on so the fee is definitely
 
01:36:22.830 --> 01:36:22.840 align:start position:0%
within scope of your business is my
 
01:36:25.629 --> 01:36:25.639 align:start position:0%
feeling about that yeah or if it slides
 
01:36:28.350 --> 01:36:28.360 align:start position:0%
into the ocean that's even
 
01:36:32.310 --> 01:36:32.320 align:start position:0%
worse the fee we're talking
 
01:36:35.470 --> 01:36:35.480 align:start position:0%
about uh is supposed to be related to
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
Insurance regulation not to Insurance uh
 
01:36:42.510 --> 01:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
payments or premiums but to to the
 
01:36:44.870 --> 01:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
activities of the insurance department
 
01:36:46.310 --> 01:36:46.320 align:start position:0%
that's what we pay for because we're
 
01:36:49.149 --> 01:36:49.159 align:start position:0%
regulated by the department okay then
 
01:36:51.310 --> 01:36:51.320 align:start position:0%
the second question it's a separate
 
01:36:53.629 --> 01:36:53.639 align:start position:0%
question that is the fundamental issue
 
01:36:56.669 --> 01:36:56.679 align:start position:0%
is is that okay we're talking about
 
01:36:58.709 --> 01:36:58.719 align:start position:0%
that's why I brought in banking to say
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
is okay this this is not the only
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
Department we do this with we do this
 
01:37:05.790 --> 01:37:05.800 align:start position:0%
with banking also that uh we we created
 
01:37:09.030 --> 01:37:09.040 align:start position:0%
this regulatory Authority for the
 
01:37:11.310 --> 01:37:11.320 align:start position:0%
purpose of creating licenses and you
 
01:37:12.950 --> 01:37:12.960 align:start position:0%
know what John Hunt's rule of lure oh
 
01:37:15.270 --> 01:37:15.280 align:start position:0%
yes I know that so we can take it away
 
01:37:17.229 --> 01:37:17.239 align:start position:0%
from you but then now we got to pay
 
01:37:18.709 --> 01:37:18.719 align:start position:0%
those bureaucrats we got to pay those
 
01:37:20.550 --> 01:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
people we got to pay the department to
 
01:37:23.310 --> 01:37:23.320 align:start position:0%
do what it does and this is how we made
 
01:37:25.709 --> 01:37:25.719 align:start position:0%
the decision that we weren't going to
 
01:37:28.990 --> 01:37:29.000 align:start position:0%
ask the taxpayer to pay for it okay it's
 
01:37:31.310 --> 01:37:31.320 align:start position:0%
really consumer protection it really you
 
01:37:33.310 --> 01:37:33.320 align:start position:0%
know consumers you know pay for the h
 
01:37:35.030 --> 01:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
off but in this case in these two
 
01:37:37.750 --> 01:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
departments we ask to fund themselves
 
01:37:39.510 --> 01:37:39.520 align:start position:0%
and I would like uh Mr beton Court to
 
01:37:42.109 --> 01:37:42.119 align:start position:0%
answer the question about the taxes and
 
01:37:44.350 --> 01:37:44.360 align:start position:0%
can you verify what he was saying about
 
01:37:47.189 --> 01:37:47.199 align:start position:0%
taxes so George and I obviously have a
 
01:37:49.270 --> 01:37:49.280 align:start position:0%
bit of a difference of opinion on
 
01:37:52.430 --> 01:37:52.440 align:start position:0%
this what I would say though
 
01:37:54.669 --> 01:37:54.679 align:start position:0%
is the argument that this is somehow a
 
01:37:54.679 --> 01:37:55.470 align:start position:0%
is the argument that this is somehow a
new

01:37:55.470 --> 01:37:55.480 align:start position:0%
new
 
01:37:58.390 --> 01:37:58.400 align:start position:0%
tax I don't think is
 
01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.310 align:start position:0%
tax I don't think is
accurate

01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
accurate
 
01:38:04.629 --> 01:38:04.639 align:start position:0%
um the assessment is currently in
 
01:38:06.790 --> 01:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
place that's not
 
01:38:09.109 --> 01:38:09.119 align:start position:0%
changing you know there were some people
 
01:38:12.149 --> 01:38:12.159 align:start position:0%
who had said why don't we just have in
 
01:38:15.149 --> 01:38:15.159 align:start position:0%
the bill that you'll separately assess
 
01:38:17.070 --> 01:38:17.080 align:start position:0%
the companies for million dollars for
 
01:38:18.870 --> 01:38:18.880 align:start position:0%
this program just the Property and
 
01:38:21.270 --> 01:38:21.280 align:start position:0%
Casualty people yes there was that
 
01:38:25.310 --> 01:38:25.320 align:start position:0%
suggestion and I said I don't like that
 
01:38:28.149 --> 01:38:28.159 align:start position:0%
idea for some of the reasons that George
 
01:38:29.510 --> 01:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
talked about because I think at that
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
point it does start to take on the feel
 
01:38:34.109 --> 01:38:34.119 align:start position:0%
of an additional tax which I don't
 
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
support and secondly I'm always very
 
01:38:37.719 --> 01:38:39.109 align:start position:0%
support and secondly I'm always very
wary

01:38:39.109 --> 01:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
wary
 
01:38:41.229 --> 01:38:41.239 align:start position:0%
anytime somebody comes forward with a
 
01:38:43.310 --> 01:38:43.320 align:start position:0%
proposal to address their particular
 
01:38:46.350 --> 01:38:46.360 align:start position:0%
program or issue or challenge via an
 
01:38:48.830 --> 01:38:48.840 align:start position:0%
assessment a separately made assessment
 
01:38:51.470 --> 01:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
on the companies to address that problem
 
01:38:52.709 --> 01:38:52.719 align:start position:0%
because then you've created the
 
01:38:54.790 --> 01:38:54.800 align:start position:0%
precedent and everybody's going to come
 
01:38:56.589 --> 01:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
forward and look for their particular
 
01:38:59.830 --> 01:38:59.840 align:start position:0%
issue to be addressed that way so for
 
01:39:01.669 --> 01:39:01.679 align:start position:0%
those reasons I said no we're not going
 
01:39:04.030 --> 01:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
to do a separate assessment what we're
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
going to do
 
01:39:09.470 --> 01:39:09.480 align:start position:0%
instead is to retain what we don't spend
 
01:39:12.510 --> 01:39:12.520 align:start position:0%
up to a million dollars because again
 
01:39:14.430 --> 01:39:14.440 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee what the companies
 
01:39:16.790 --> 01:39:16.800 align:start position:0%
are going to get credited back for at
 
01:39:19.750 --> 01:39:19.760 align:start position:0%
the end of the fiscal year or what they
 
01:39:19.760 --> 01:39:20.830 align:start position:0%
the end of the fiscal year or what they
were

01:39:20.830 --> 01:39:20.840 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:39:24.830 --> 01:39:24.840 align:start position:0%
assessed so original bill was was that
 
01:39:26.709 --> 01:39:26.719 align:start position:0%
they didn't have any skin in the game
 
01:39:28.910 --> 01:39:28.920 align:start position:0%
right they really like because because
 
01:39:31.430 --> 01:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
all because all we were taking the money
 
01:39:34.070 --> 01:39:34.080 align:start position:0%
from is from a not anything to do with
 
01:39:37.229 --> 01:39:37.239 align:start position:0%
this assessment but doing with this with
 
01:39:39.390 --> 01:39:39.400 align:start position:0%
one of the few taxes we actually do have
 
01:39:42.149 --> 01:39:42.159 align:start position:0%
in the state which was the insurance tax
 
01:39:45.669 --> 01:39:45.679 align:start position:0%
that's right and that and so and that by
 
01:39:48.270 --> 01:39:48.280 align:start position:0%
the way still by well I understand that
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
so basically what you know the companies
 
01:39:52.430 --> 01:39:52.440 align:start position:0%
are saying well that's very nice of you
 
01:39:55.990 --> 01:39:56.000 align:start position:0%
guys willing to do this favor to us to
 
01:39:58.470 --> 01:39:58.480 align:start position:0%
help you know your you know that help
 
01:40:02.470 --> 01:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
people um premiums um uh but and the
 
01:40:04.750 --> 01:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
money you're using is out of this this
 
01:40:06.629 --> 01:40:06.639 align:start position:0%
other tax which they've already done
 
01:40:10.270 --> 01:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
their best we've already lowered the tax
 
01:40:12.189 --> 01:40:12.199 align:start position:0%
you know much you know some people might
 
01:40:14.990 --> 01:40:15.000 align:start position:0%
disagree I think representative alme I
 
01:40:17.149 --> 01:40:17.159 align:start position:0%
don't think was too happy when we we
 
01:40:20.629 --> 01:40:20.639 align:start position:0%
propose the the decrease in the tax so
 
01:40:23.550 --> 01:40:23.560 align:start position:0%
um so I I think I think that you in
 
01:40:26.430 --> 01:40:26.440 align:start position:0%
hindsight I'd say this this is not the
 
01:40:28.430 --> 01:40:28.440 align:start position:0%
time for this legislation this is this
 
01:40:31.870 --> 01:40:31.880 align:start position:0%
is yes it's it's it's it's well-
 
01:40:35.629 --> 01:40:35.639 align:start position:0%
intended uh the initial cause or I guess
 
01:40:37.390 --> 01:40:37.400 align:start position:0%
we could say is uh would have been great
 
01:40:40.229 --> 01:40:40.239 align:start position:0%
Wimer flush but you know when when the
 
01:40:42.669 --> 01:40:42.679 align:start position:0%
revenues were coming in and they say you
 
01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
know we could have done this in lie of
 
01:40:46.830 --> 01:40:46.840 align:start position:0%
cutting the tax back then when we did it
 
01:40:51.149 --> 01:40:51.159 align:start position:0%
but um at at this point um I think it is
 
01:40:53.750 --> 01:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
kind of hard pressed to to uh use the
 
01:40:56.709 --> 01:40:56.719 align:start position:0%
assessment system to fund this this
 
01:40:58.750 --> 01:40:58.760 align:start position:0%
pilot program so if I if I might Mr
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
chairman to that point I'll share the
 
01:41:02.910 --> 01:41:02.920 align:start position:0%
same thing with you that I shared with
 
01:41:05.229 --> 01:41:05.239 align:start position:0%
house finance if that's the position
 
01:41:07.910 --> 01:41:07.920 align:start position:0%
that you all want to take then let us
 
01:41:09.430 --> 01:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
draft up an amendment that would
 
01:41:12.510 --> 01:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
establish the program would say that the
 
01:41:15.109 --> 01:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
way it will be funded at present is for
 
01:41:18.189 --> 01:41:18.199 align:start position:0%
any federal dollars or individual or
 
01:41:20.950 --> 01:41:20.960 align:start position:0%
contributions of any kind should they be
 
01:41:23.669 --> 01:41:23.679 align:start position:0%
made available we could just drop those
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
into the program and be ready to go
 
01:41:29.629 --> 01:41:29.639 align:start position:0%
rather than having to potentially wait
 
01:41:31.950 --> 01:41:31.960 align:start position:0%
to come back to you to get the program
 
01:41:33.669 --> 01:41:33.679 align:start position:0%
established while the federal dollars
 
01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:36.400 align:start position:0%
are sitting there we can give you an
 
01:41:38.149 --> 01:41:38.159 align:start position:0%
amendment that basically establishes the
 
01:41:40.310 --> 01:41:40.320 align:start position:0%
program good Keeps Us open for business
 
01:41:42.629 --> 01:41:42.639 align:start position:0%
should those funds if there was if if
 
01:41:45.589 --> 01:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
you could identify the
 
01:41:49.589 --> 01:41:49.599 align:start position:0%
funds I assume you George are you you're
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
the lawyer are you okay with that yeah I
 
01:41:54.270 --> 01:41:54.280 align:start position:0%
I I like the idea I wish that part of
 
01:41:56.830 --> 01:41:56.840 align:start position:0%
the problem is that this came upon us uh
 
01:41:59.229 --> 01:41:59.239 align:start position:0%
suddenly we really haven't had time to
 
01:42:02.550 --> 01:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
fully discuss the issue but I I had been
 
01:42:04.109 --> 01:42:04.119 align:start position:0%
thinking about that and talked with
 
01:42:05.950 --> 01:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
Lindsay and some of the companies about
 
01:42:08.350 --> 01:42:08.360 align:start position:0%
doing exactly what the commissioner is
 
01:42:10.310 --> 01:42:10.320 align:start position:0%
suggesting right now get the structure
 
01:42:13.149 --> 01:42:13.159 align:start position:0%
in place you you've heard the merits of
 
01:42:16.430 --> 01:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
the of the underlying uh uh CA the
 
01:42:20.030 --> 01:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
program uh and and uh and and and so
 
01:42:23.430 --> 01:42:23.440 align:start position:0%
that work has been done and and and to
 
01:42:25.870 --> 01:42:25.880 align:start position:0%
allow grants uh I think that and
 
01:42:27.189 --> 01:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
commissioner knows better than I do but
 
01:42:30.390 --> 01:42:30.400 align:start position:0%
I think that there was what happens
 
01:42:32.030 --> 01:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
nobody knows but that there was some
 
01:42:34.629 --> 01:42:34.639 align:start position:0%
serious interest or or belief that the
 
01:42:36.750 --> 01:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
federal government was going to step in
 
01:42:39.310 --> 01:42:39.320 align:start position:0%
and provide grants to the states in this
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
area who knows whether that's going to
 
01:42:43.669 --> 01:42:43.679 align:start position:0%
happen but I say that because the a
 
01:42:46.229 --> 01:42:46.239 align:start position:0%
number of the states that enacted uh
 
01:42:49.189 --> 01:42:49.199 align:start position:0%
mitigation programs like this one did do
 
01:42:51.310 --> 01:42:51.320 align:start position:0%
have a provision in their laws that
 
01:42:53.709 --> 01:42:53.719 align:start position:0%
calls for accepting uh Federal grant
 
01:42:57.589 --> 01:42:57.599 align:start position:0%
money and in addition to that uh again I
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
can't make any promises but I I think
 
01:43:02.830 --> 01:43:02.840 align:start position:0%
that this would allow the opportunity
 
01:43:04.870 --> 01:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
for private grants insurance companies
 
01:43:08.310 --> 01:43:08.320 align:start position:0%
may wish to participate uh in in the
 
01:43:10.510 --> 01:43:10.520 align:start position:0%
program again I can't I can't speak for
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
that but uh you know we support the
 
01:43:15.790 --> 01:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
commissioner's uh initiative and this so
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
if you did uh as has been suggested get
 
01:43:21.910 --> 01:43:21.920 align:start position:0%
the structure in place wait for a better
 
01:43:24.270 --> 01:43:24.280 align:start position:0%
time and and see how that works and in
 
01:43:26.669 --> 01:43:26.679 align:start position:0%
the meanwhile allow for the possibility
 
01:43:28.629 --> 01:43:28.639 align:start position:0%
that there'll be other other funding
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
that that that can start to seed see the
 
01:43:34.709 --> 01:43:34.719 align:start position:0%
the program to go forward and I had a
 
01:43:36.470 --> 01:43:36.480 align:start position:0%
private conversation with representative
 
01:43:38.950 --> 01:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
Wier in which he had said he was very
 
01:43:40.870 --> 01:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
comfortable with that approach as
 
01:43:47.709 --> 01:43:47.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:51.390 --> 01:43:51.400 align:start position:0%
commissioner why don't you speak to
 
01:43:55.709 --> 01:43:55.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:00.189 --> 01:44:00.199 align:start position:0%
Association done your dorge move on I um
 
01:44:02.109 --> 01:44:02.119 align:start position:0%
this is exactly uh and when you
 
01:44:03.750 --> 01:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned it may not be the right year I
 
01:44:05.229 --> 01:44:05.239 align:start position:0%
was hoping that the commissioner would
 
01:44:07.750 --> 01:44:07.760 align:start position:0%
offer to let the bill go forward uh
 
01:44:10.189 --> 01:44:10.199 align:start position:0%
Rhode Island just introduced a bill uh
 
01:44:11.910 --> 01:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
that doesn't have a funding mechanism uh
 
01:44:14.430 --> 01:44:14.440 align:start position:0%
just to allow for uh grants I think
 
01:44:16.709 --> 01:44:16.719 align:start position:0%
there is some thought that Washington is
 
01:44:19.109 --> 01:44:19.119 align:start position:0%
looking at other ways to better use
 
01:44:21.229 --> 01:44:21.239 align:start position:0%
federal granting and some of this
 
01:44:24.109 --> 01:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
prophylactic kind of pre planning is
 
01:44:26.669 --> 01:44:26.679 align:start position:0%
more aligned and so I I think this
 
01:44:30.030 --> 01:44:30.040 align:start position:0%
underlying um fortified home program is
 
01:44:33.229 --> 01:44:33.239 align:start position:0%
is worth passing but with George we
 
01:44:36.030 --> 01:44:36.040 align:start position:0%
agree on the funding thank you okay so I
 
01:44:38.830 --> 01:44:38.840 align:start position:0%
have a question so under this
 
01:44:43.669 --> 01:44:43.679 align:start position:0%
program uh if a person gets the grant to
 
01:44:45.629 --> 01:44:45.639 align:start position:0%
cut the tree for example like you said
 
01:44:47.910 --> 01:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
yeah so does he have to pay pay back
 
01:44:49.390 --> 01:44:49.400 align:start position:0%
that money
 
01:44:53.390 --> 01:44:53.400 align:start position:0%
no to Grant so the question you might
 
01:44:56.550 --> 01:44:56.560 align:start position:0%
get it might get a $10.99 right yeah so
 
01:44:58.589 --> 01:44:58.599 align:start position:0%
so so that that raes a question about
 
01:45:01.030 --> 01:45:01.040 align:start position:0%
the see I don't I don't have a problem
 
01:45:03.589 --> 01:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
with the you know objective this program
 
01:45:05.149 --> 01:45:05.159 align:start position:0%
but the implementation part when you
 
01:45:07.950 --> 01:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
mentioned that first come first basis
 
01:45:11.390 --> 01:45:11.400 align:start position:0%
correct so now once once this program is
 
01:45:14.510 --> 01:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
in place yes and uh and obviously people
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
who would be knowing about it they are
 
01:45:18.750 --> 01:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
going to apply and first question would
 
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
be that how the insurance department or
 
01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:22.159 align:start position:0%
whichever Department going to oversee
 
01:45:24.390 --> 01:45:24.400 align:start position:0%
this how are make criteria to give how
 
01:45:28.229 --> 01:45:28.239 align:start position:0%
much to give or give or not to give that
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
detail is actually in but the most
 
01:45:31.950 --> 01:45:31.960 align:start position:0%
important thing is that once you once
 
01:45:34.189 --> 01:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
you allow someone to get it yes and now
 
01:45:36.669 --> 01:45:36.679 align:start position:0%
you say the second person applies for it
 
01:45:39.750 --> 01:45:39.760 align:start position:0%
and you say the fund has run out I me
 
01:45:42.550 --> 01:45:42.560 align:start position:0%
that that has happened with every take
 
01:45:44.669 --> 01:45:44.679 align:start position:0%
the solar exemption you know that you
 
01:45:45.910 --> 01:45:45.920 align:start position:0%
know the federal government yeah there's
 
01:45:48.270 --> 01:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
a limit to you you can get it and then
 
01:45:50.990 --> 01:45:51.000 align:start position:0%
it and and they run out of money and say
 
01:45:53.229 --> 01:45:53.239 align:start position:0%
no no more this year and wait till next
 
01:45:56.310 --> 01:45:56.320 align:start position:0%
year so yeah that is that happens I see
 
01:45:58.109 --> 01:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
that I see that under this program there
 
01:46:02.950 --> 01:46:02.960 align:start position:0%
could be a lot of uh uh situations of
 
01:46:05.550 --> 01:46:05.560 align:start position:0%
misuse of this program until it unless
 
01:46:09.109 --> 01:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
it is administered properly yeah in
 
01:46:11.189 --> 01:46:11.199 align:start position:0%
general I have reservations I mean for
 
01:46:12.430 --> 01:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
all due respect to all the government
 
01:46:14.870 --> 01:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
officials in I do have reservations of
 
01:46:17.229 --> 01:46:17.239 align:start position:0%
government running businesses where you
 
01:46:20.750 --> 01:46:20.760 align:start position:0%
provide certain grants unless it is done
 
01:46:22.350 --> 01:46:22.360 align:start position:0%
appropriately with all the wealth and
 
01:46:26.070 --> 01:46:26.080 align:start position:0%
vels in place there is a situation where
 
01:46:28.149 --> 01:46:28.159 align:start position:0%
this program can be misused the good
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
news is it's only 10 grand so you're
 
01:46:31.430 --> 01:46:31.440 align:start position:0%
you're not going to have anybody making
 
01:46:34.189 --> 01:46:34.199 align:start position:0%
running off a lot of money Grand but but
 
01:46:37.270 --> 01:46:37.280 align:start position:0%
yes I hear you that that you but I I my
 
01:46:39.990 --> 01:46:40.000 align:start position:0%
take on my take is a lot of people won't
 
01:46:43.510 --> 01:46:43.520 align:start position:0%
take it won't do it because that they
 
01:46:45.149 --> 01:46:45.159 align:start position:0%
don't really want to lose that tree they
 
01:46:48.350 --> 01:46:48.360 align:start position:0%
love that tree the dogs and certainly
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
won't get rid of their dogs I mean so I
 
01:46:53.470 --> 01:46:53.480 align:start position:0%
would say this is that is a case where
 
01:46:56.470 --> 01:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
um it is is trying to be proactive okay
 
01:46:57.950 --> 01:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
you know you you know put yourself in
 
01:46:59.910 --> 01:46:59.920 align:start position:0%
the in the department shoes that they
 
01:47:02.149 --> 01:47:02.159 align:start position:0%
get these calls you know every time
 
01:47:04.470 --> 01:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
there's a bad weather you know event
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
they're getting calls where people are
 
01:47:09.270 --> 01:47:09.280 align:start position:0%
upset that that they're you know they
 
01:47:11.950 --> 01:47:11.960 align:start position:0%
this um whatever claim what their claims
 
01:47:13.550 --> 01:47:13.560 align:start position:0%
or whatever happened with the wind and
 
01:47:16.149 --> 01:47:16.159 align:start position:0%
ice or hail and all the all these you
 
01:47:19.350 --> 01:47:19.360 align:start position:0%
know wonderful things that can happen
 
01:47:21.229 --> 01:47:21.239 align:start position:0%
and and I'm sure some of the cases are
 
01:47:23.310 --> 01:47:23.320 align:start position:0%
they go very you know how far to go well
 
01:47:25.229 --> 01:47:25.239 align:start position:0%
you know I got that ice you know because
 
01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
the water I got ice and I broke my back
 
01:47:29.030 --> 01:47:29.040 align:start position:0%
and you know went medical coverage you
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
know who knows they how far people will
 
01:47:33.310 --> 01:47:33.320 align:start position:0%
go you know make these phone calls and
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
and the Department's just saying is you
 
01:47:37.629 --> 01:47:37.639 align:start position:0%
know what can you know what can we do to
 
01:47:39.910 --> 01:47:39.920 align:start position:0%
at least make sure that no underwriter
 
01:47:42.629 --> 01:47:42.639 align:start position:0%
shows up to your property and and you
 
01:47:45.910 --> 01:47:45.920 align:start position:0%
know says boy that's a big tree that
 
01:47:48.070 --> 01:47:48.080 align:start position:0%
that it maybe you know it give people an
 
01:47:49.990 --> 01:47:50.000 align:start position:0%
opportunity and I know myself my summer
 
01:47:52.830 --> 01:47:52.840 align:start position:0%
home this is not true my home but my
 
01:47:54.910 --> 01:47:54.920 align:start position:0%
cber house I had these trees that are
 
01:47:56.350 --> 01:47:56.360 align:start position:0%
just they're really old trees and
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
they're all starting to fall down um and
 
01:48:01.350 --> 01:48:01.360 align:start position:0%
and some of them right are on the power
 
01:48:03.830 --> 01:48:03.840 align:start position:0%
lines and I can I keep saying you know
 
01:48:05.470 --> 01:48:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's got to get fixed but every time
 
01:48:08.310 --> 01:48:08.320 align:start position:0%
I've called the utility they let's wait
 
01:48:10.229 --> 01:48:10.239 align:start position:0%
till it falls down yeah but but in in
 
01:48:12.790 --> 01:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
that situation when those trees are
 
01:48:14.629 --> 01:48:14.639 align:start position:0%
anywhere dangerous to the house you
 
01:48:17.030 --> 01:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
don't want to postpone cutting those
 
01:48:19.149 --> 01:48:19.159 align:start position:0%
trees just because insurance is not
 
01:48:21.750 --> 01:48:21.760 align:start position:0%
covering it or you're not getting you
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
have to do it anyway because is going to
 
01:48:26.149 --> 01:48:26.159 align:start position:0%
be be doing it anyway yeah if haard to
 
01:48:27.750 --> 01:48:27.760 align:start position:0%
your own house your own safety this is
 
01:48:30.109 --> 01:48:30.119 align:start position:0%
an idea to be a motivator so in that
 
01:48:31.629 --> 01:48:31.639 align:start position:0%
case I'm I'm going to apply for Grant
 
01:48:34.109 --> 01:48:34.119 align:start position:0%
and get free money and get that done
 
01:48:36.310 --> 01:48:36.320 align:start position:0%
which I would have done anyway that's
 
01:48:38.510 --> 01:48:38.520 align:start position:0%
the thing I'm I'm seeing that ah okay so
 
01:48:40.470 --> 01:48:40.480 align:start position:0%
you think we shouldn't do this at all I
 
01:48:42.030 --> 01:48:42.040 align:start position:0%
don't think that there a requirement for
 
01:48:43.669 --> 01:48:43.679 align:start position:0%
this program there is no requirement for
 
01:48:47.709 --> 01:48:47.719 align:start position:0%
this program this is this was I mean
 
01:48:50.709 --> 01:48:50.719 align:start position:0%
maybe we can tell why this maybe I'm not
 
01:48:53.109 --> 01:48:53.119 align:start position:0%
doing a good job here help me out here I
 
01:48:55.350 --> 01:48:55.360 align:start position:0%
think um we we're focusing on trees
 
01:48:57.149 --> 01:48:57.159 align:start position:0%
because they're simple the vast majority
 
01:48:59.109 --> 01:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
of this program isn't about trees it's
 
01:49:01.430 --> 01:49:01.440 align:start position:0%
about building and rebuilding your roofs
 
01:49:04.870 --> 01:49:04.880 align:start position:0%
and your structures to the ibhs standard
 
01:49:06.950 --> 01:49:06.960 align:start position:0%
that which is a fortified home standard
 
01:49:09.149 --> 01:49:09.159 align:start position:0%
so much of this grant money will be used
 
01:49:12.950 --> 01:49:12.960 align:start position:0%
to put better roofs on that withstand
 
01:49:16.229 --> 01:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
windstorms better and so though I think
 
01:49:17.669 --> 01:49:17.679 align:start position:0%
you know the commissioner was wise to
 
01:49:20.950 --> 01:49:20.960 align:start position:0%
allow for a wide range um most of this
 
01:49:22.910 --> 01:49:22.920 align:start position:0%
money will be used to incentivize
 
01:49:26.950 --> 01:49:26.960 align:start position:0%
consumers to do the better roof so that
 
01:49:30.070 --> 01:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
we as a state can look at how how those
 
01:49:33.030 --> 01:49:33.040 align:start position:0%
roofs fair in the next large store and
 
01:49:34.510 --> 01:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
so then we'll come back in three years
 
01:49:36.550 --> 01:49:36.560 align:start position:0%
and say we had a bad Windstorm we had a
 
01:49:38.910 --> 01:49:38.920 align:start position:0%
micr burst and there were five houses in
 
01:49:42.270 --> 01:49:42.280 align:start position:0%
that microburst area who had the ibhs
 
01:49:45.390 --> 01:49:45.400 align:start position:0%
Fortified roof did it do better and you
 
01:49:50.189 --> 01:49:50.199 align:start position:0%
explain what uh ibhs is in international
 
01:49:53.589 --> 01:49:53.599 align:start position:0%
home um Builders requirement
 
01:49:55.229 --> 01:49:55.239 align:start position:0%
Insurance building and home safety which
 
01:49:57.149 --> 01:49:57.159 align:start position:0%
is a an organization funded by the
 
01:49:59.030 --> 01:49:59.040 align:start position:0%
insurance industry so that we can do
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
this this learning um the commissioner
 
01:50:04.030 --> 01:50:04.040 align:start position:0%
was also very smart in in his bill he
 
01:50:06.550 --> 01:50:06.560 align:start position:0%
put pretty strict income limits so that
 
01:50:10.189 --> 01:50:10.199 align:start position:0%
this isn't going to just be a a boon to
 
01:50:12.189 --> 01:50:12.199 align:start position:0%
rich people who want to fortify their
 
01:50:14.669 --> 01:50:14.679 align:start position:0%
roofs these limits are such that it will
 
01:50:17.629 --> 01:50:17.639 align:start position:0%
be helping the lowest income homeowners
 
01:50:20.750 --> 01:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire um and I think we have
 
01:50:23.910 --> 01:50:23.920 align:start position:0%
to give him the opportunity to figure
 
01:50:27.070 --> 01:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
this program out have a few Grant rounds
 
01:50:29.070 --> 01:50:29.080 align:start position:0%
go and see how it works and we'll come
 
01:50:32.030 --> 01:50:32.040 align:start position:0%
back uh the initial results from the
 
01:50:34.790 --> 01:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
Alabama uh fortified home program have
 
01:50:37.790 --> 01:50:37.800 align:start position:0%
been phenomenal now we have different C
 
01:50:39.950 --> 01:50:39.960 align:start position:0%
but they probably had all didn't have
 
01:50:42.470 --> 01:50:42.480 align:start position:0%
the proper not a not even a question
 
01:50:44.790 --> 01:50:44.800 align:start position:0%
that uh that their Roof Systems are
 
01:50:48.709 --> 01:50:48.719 align:start position:0%
different a 10 roofs uh but uh the
 
01:50:50.790 --> 01:50:50.800 align:start position:0%
industry supports fortified homes and
 
01:50:53.189 --> 01:50:53.199 align:start position:0%
the the test here thank you and if I may
 
01:50:55.229 --> 01:50:55.239 align:start position:0%
just add to that the word incentives
 
01:50:58.830 --> 01:50:58.840 align:start position:0%
been used and surely it may very well
 
01:51:02.189 --> 01:51:02.199 align:start position:0%
incentivize some people to do those
 
01:51:03.950 --> 01:51:03.960 align:start position:0%
improvements but I want to make sure
 
01:51:06.069 --> 01:51:06.079 align:start position:0%
that in the term incentivized is not
 
01:51:09.510 --> 01:51:09.520 align:start position:0%
lost the fact that some
 
01:51:12.750 --> 01:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
people would absolutely take the steps
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
to address the roof or the tree whatever
 
01:51:16.390 --> 01:51:16.400 align:start position:0%
the issue may be if they had the
 
01:51:20.750 --> 01:51:20.760 align:start position:0%
financial means to do it I mean I'll
 
01:51:22.229 --> 01:51:22.239 align:start position:0%
I'll embarrass my parents a little bit
 
01:51:25.310 --> 01:51:25.320 align:start position:0%
my my parents had a very large tree
 
01:51:26.750 --> 01:51:26.760 align:start position:0%
beloved but it was
 
01:51:29.629 --> 01:51:29.639 align:start position:0%
dead that for because of how close it
 
01:51:30.790 --> 01:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
was to their
 
01:51:34.030 --> 01:51:34.040 align:start position:0%
home it it was going to end up costing
 
01:51:35.550 --> 01:51:35.560 align:start position:0%
them about
 
01:51:39.709 --> 01:51:39.719 align:start position:0%
$5,000 and they're on a fixed income um
 
01:51:42.310 --> 01:51:42.320 align:start position:0%
their favorite son helped them to be
 
01:51:46.030 --> 01:51:46.040 align:start position:0%
able to do the work um
 
01:51:48.830 --> 01:51:48.840 align:start position:0%
no I'm the only
 
01:51:53.430 --> 01:51:53.440 align:start position:0%
boy the the competition wasn't tough um
 
01:51:56.069 --> 01:51:56.079 align:start position:0%
but um I helped them with the cost of it
 
01:51:58.790 --> 01:51:58.800 align:start position:0%
but what it drove home to me is that
 
01:52:00.550 --> 01:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
there are people who would absolutely
 
01:52:02.470 --> 01:52:02.480 align:start position:0%
want to do the proactive responsible
 
01:52:04.510 --> 01:52:04.520 align:start position:0%
thing but simply don't have the budget
 
01:52:07.390 --> 01:52:07.400 align:start position:0%
to be able to do it and so to the extent
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
that this program could be leverage to
 
01:52:11.149 --> 01:52:11.159 align:start position:0%
help them bridge the gap between what
 
01:52:13.950 --> 01:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
they have to contribute towards that and
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
what it is going to take to complete
 
01:52:18.109 --> 01:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
that work then again I think we've
 
01:52:19.870 --> 01:52:19.880 align:start position:0%
opened up a door of opportunity for
 
01:52:23.109 --> 01:52:23.119 align:start position:0%
people to not only again I'm an
 
01:52:25.109 --> 01:52:25.119 align:start position:0%
insurance guy here so I'm looking at it
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
from that perspective but not to be lost
 
01:52:28.229 --> 01:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
in this whole conversation is the fact
 
01:52:29.390 --> 01:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
that the home and the property is going
 
01:52:30.669 --> 01:52:30.679 align:start position:0%
to be physically
 
01:52:32.910 --> 01:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
safer so that you're not having people
 
01:52:35.350 --> 01:52:35.360 align:start position:0%
in danger or or in a or at a greater
 
01:52:39.310 --> 01:52:39.320 align:start position:0%
risk of danger and so I think all of us
 
01:52:42.750 --> 01:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
would if resources were no limit do
 
01:52:44.910 --> 01:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
everything we could to make sure that
 
01:52:46.350 --> 01:52:46.360 align:start position:0%
our property and our homes were as safe
 
01:52:49.790 --> 01:52:49.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
be okay um so where what's section is
 
01:52:59.669 --> 01:52:59.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:04.350 --> 01:53:04.360 align:start position:0%
Bill yes so Mr chairman just to help it
 
01:53:07.069 --> 01:53:07.079 align:start position:0%
is page nine and it is the bolded
 
01:53:07.079 --> 01:53:08.470 align:start position:0%
is page nine and it is the bolded
material

01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
material
 
01:53:12.589 --> 01:53:12.599 align:start position:0%
soal numeral s yes that's right so again
 
01:53:15.950 --> 01:53:15.960 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman if you were willing to allow
 
01:53:17.390 --> 01:53:17.400 align:start position:0%
us to move forward with just the
 
01:53:19.470 --> 01:53:19.480 align:start position:0%
establishment of the program but you
 
01:53:22.870 --> 01:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
wanted the funding mechanism to be I
 
01:53:25.510 --> 01:53:25.520 align:start position:0%
think the technical term for it is to
 
01:53:28.229 --> 01:53:28.239 align:start position:0%
accept donations or funds that's what
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
they call federal grants are made
 
01:53:32.229 --> 01:53:32.239 align:start position:0%
available for accounting purposes we
 
01:53:33.709 --> 01:53:33.719 align:start position:0%
could get you that language by the end
 
01:53:36.069 --> 01:53:36.079 align:start position:0%
of the day today and you'd have it in
 
01:53:39.669 --> 01:53:39.679 align:start position:0%
plenty of time for the full executive
 
01:53:43.030 --> 01:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
session well okay yeah actually at this
 
01:53:45.030 --> 01:53:45.040 align:start position:0%
point I don't even think that this is an
 
01:53:47.669 --> 01:53:47.679 align:start position:0%
early Bill anymore because if if you're
 
01:53:49.870 --> 01:53:49.880 align:start position:0%
getting down to it you you're taking all
 
01:53:52.109 --> 01:53:52.119 align:start position:0%
the funding out so some of the urgencies
 
01:53:54.750 --> 01:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
out of there
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
um no no I wouldn't retain it it's you
 
01:54:00.270 --> 01:54:00.280 align:start position:0%
know we could we we
 
01:54:02.390 --> 01:54:02.400 align:start position:0%
um you could take what time you'd like
 
01:54:03.870 --> 01:54:03.880 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I'm just telling you I could
 
01:54:05.550 --> 01:54:05.560 align:start position:0%
get you the amendment you need by the
 
01:54:08.270 --> 01:54:08.280 align:start position:0%
end of the day and then you can yeah
 
01:54:10.669 --> 01:54:10.679 align:start position:0%
okay do what you like I mean I how how
 
01:54:13.830 --> 01:54:13.840 align:start position:0%
do people feel that we would take do yes
 
01:54:13.840 --> 01:54:16.870 align:start position:0%
do people feel that we would take do yes
represent

01:54:16.870 --> 01:54:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:24.950 --> 01:54:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:28.310 --> 01:54:28.320 align:start position:0%
oh oh the original underlying bill on my
 
01:54:32.350 --> 01:54:32.360 align:start position:0%
life and help people that was the first
 
01:54:32.360 --> 01:54:42.510 align:start position:0%
life and help people that was the first
yeah

01:54:42.510 --> 01:54:42.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:47.669 --> 01:54:47.679 align:start position:0%
yes sorry um so allowing them to have
 
01:54:50.709 --> 01:54:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:54.189 --> 01:54:54.199 align:start position:0%
data I think even maybe I'm being a
 
01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
little cynical but you know it's not
 
01:55:00.069 --> 01:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
that hard to drill down to figure out
 
01:55:03.149 --> 01:55:03.159 align:start position:0%
like if you only have a few employers
 
01:55:06.790 --> 01:55:06.800 align:start position:0%
employees as a self-funded employer you
 
01:55:09.229 --> 01:55:09.239 align:start position:0%
kind of already know like who your
 
01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:12.840 align:start position:0%
people are and if they're sick and who's
 
01:55:15.950 --> 01:55:15.960 align:start position:0%
probably using the most insurance and
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
costing you the most money so I feel
 
01:55:23.149 --> 01:55:23.159 align:start position:0%
like allowing them to have their claims
 
01:55:26.350 --> 01:55:26.360 align:start position:0%
experience could be ripe for wrongful
 
01:55:29.069 --> 01:55:29.079 align:start position:0%
termination suits I think I believe in
 
01:55:30.589 --> 01:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
the statute it says that would be
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
illegal well of course but that's that's
 
01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:37.840 align:start position:0%
my concern yeah well that was the reason
 
01:55:39.830 --> 01:55:39.840 align:start position:0%
part it was I worked over at Bae well
 
01:55:42.910 --> 01:55:42.920 align:start position:0%
you're the sponsor of this bill so she's
 
01:55:45.629 --> 01:55:45.639 align:start position:0%
you now I worked over at Bae for many
 
01:55:45.639 --> 01:55:46.790 align:start position:0%
you now I worked over at Bae for many
many

01:55:46.790 --> 01:55:46.800 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:48.510 align:start position:0%
many
years

01:55:48.510 --> 01:55:48.520 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%
and the HR department knows exactly who
 
01:55:54.830 --> 01:55:54.840 align:start position:0%
goes out on medical and what they're
 
01:55:57.229 --> 01:55:57.239 align:start position:0%
going out on medical for they don't
 
01:56:00.950 --> 01:56:00.960 align:start position:0%
really start terminating People based on
 
01:56:03.830 --> 01:56:03.840 align:start position:0%
the claims data that's just an Actuarial
 
01:56:06.430 --> 01:56:06.440 align:start position:0%
thing that they use they already know
 
01:56:07.870 --> 01:56:07.880 align:start position:0%
and as a matter of fact in order for you
 
01:56:09.550 --> 01:56:09.560 align:start position:0%
to come back to work you have to write a
 
01:56:12.189 --> 01:56:12.199 align:start position:0%
note and get a a whole doctor's
 
01:56:14.629 --> 01:56:14.639 align:start position:0%
explanation so and I think that most
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
employers know what what they're what
 
01:56:17.910 --> 01:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
their people are doing and why they're
 
01:56:20.629 --> 01:56:20.639 align:start position:0%
going out I agree so therefore I don't
 
01:56:23.109 --> 01:56:23.119 align:start position:0%
think they need any more of the people's
 
01:56:25.830 --> 01:56:25.840 align:start position:0%
personal health information right so
 
01:56:27.669 --> 01:56:27.679 align:start position:0%
this was a department bill
 
01:56:30.149 --> 01:56:30.159 align:start position:0%
right so yeah why don't you defend it
 
01:56:32.709 --> 01:56:32.719 align:start position:0%
don't you know have make her have we're
 
01:56:35.550 --> 01:56:35.560 align:start position:0%
gonna have Dr AIS come back to deal with
 
01:56:38.310 --> 01:56:38.320 align:start position:0%
this that's a level of detail that only
 
01:56:41.229 --> 01:56:41.239 align:start position:0%
the maths the original language this is
 
01:56:43.870 --> 01:56:43.880 align:start position:0%
Bill right okay in the
 
01:56:45.629 --> 01:56:45.639 align:start position:0%
first all right the carrier
 
01:56:47.270 --> 01:56:47.280 align:start position:0%
administrator shall also notify the
 
01:56:49.189 --> 01:56:49.199 align:start position:0%
employer that if such authorization is
 
01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
provided the commissioner shall provide
 
01:56:53.229 --> 01:56:53.239 align:start position:0%
the employer access on an annual basis
 
01:56:55.910 --> 01:56:55.920 align:start position:0%
to the claims data associated with that
 
01:56:57.950 --> 01:56:57.960 align:start position:0%
employer sponsored
 
01:57:01.430 --> 01:57:01.440 align:start position:0%
plan and it says experience and that's
 
01:57:04.910 --> 01:57:04.920 align:start position:0%
very specific information right I would
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
agree with Miles because see they might
 
01:57:09.270 --> 01:57:09.280 align:start position:0%
not terminate based on that reason they
 
01:57:10.910 --> 01:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
would never say that oh I'm tered
 
01:57:12.470 --> 01:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
because of your medical history and
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
claims data but they could use that to
 
01:57:17.750 --> 01:57:17.760 align:start position:0%
determine some other reason you know
 
01:57:20.189 --> 01:57:20.199 align:start position:0%
like performance or this or that and
 
01:57:22.390 --> 01:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
that could be a factor but my question
 
01:57:24.430 --> 01:57:24.440 align:start position:0%
that more that what is the need for an
 
01:57:27.669 --> 01:57:27.679 align:start position:0%
employer to even get to know this data
 
01:57:29.109 --> 01:57:29.119 align:start position:0%
why why employer need to have a claims
 
01:57:31.510 --> 01:57:31.520 align:start position:0%
data information okay so my
 
01:57:35.229 --> 01:57:35.239 align:start position:0%
understanding is who who call me on this
 
01:57:39.750 --> 01:57:39.760 align:start position:0%
bill uh nobody in this room okay yeah I
 
01:57:42.430 --> 01:57:42.440 align:start position:0%
think it was Henry Vu and it was it was
 
01:57:45.069 --> 01:57:45.079 align:start position:0%
the issue was if you want to shot if
 
01:57:47.310 --> 01:57:47.320 align:start position:0%
you're a small you're a this is not a
 
01:57:49.589 --> 01:57:49.599 align:start position:0%
small you're a large employer you're an
 
01:57:54.750 --> 01:57:54.760 align:start position:0%
Arisa plan okay and wanted to
 
01:57:57.629 --> 01:57:57.639 align:start position:0%
shop that you wanted you wanted to have
 
01:57:59.750 --> 01:57:59.760 align:start position:0%
access to your claims data so you can
 
01:58:02.550 --> 01:58:02.560 align:start position:0%
use it to shop was that what this was bu
 
01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:04.320 align:start position:0%
with that with my memory that's what
 
01:58:06.629 --> 01:58:06.639 align:start position:0%
this bill was about it said you're using
 
01:58:19.510 --> 01:58:19.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
around if the carrier was willing to
 
01:58:25.589 --> 01:58:25.599 align:start position:0%
if the carrier was willing to share
 
01:58:29.430 --> 01:58:29.440 align:start position:0%
it well says the carrier or shall so I
 
01:58:36.390 --> 01:58:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:39.149 --> 01:58:39.159 align:start position:0%
have right so if the car doesn't want
 
01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
want yeah
 
01:58:43.069 --> 01:58:43.079 align:start position:0%
but the Carri didn't want you to shop
 
01:58:45.550 --> 01:58:45.560 align:start position:0%
around they could say no no the company
 
01:58:47.149 --> 01:58:47.159 align:start position:0%
I think we're talking company here and
 
01:58:48.669 --> 01:58:48.679 align:start position:0%
so I think we have to first establish
 
01:58:51.589 --> 01:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
nire has the best claims database in the
 
01:58:53.830 --> 01:58:53.840 align:start position:0%
nation right claims database that helps
 
01:58:55.910 --> 01:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
us do the analysis that you hear from Dr
 
01:58:59.030 --> 01:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
aiz that helps helps us educate helps
 
01:59:01.870 --> 01:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
the commissioner educate consumers about
 
01:59:03.270 --> 01:59:03.280 align:start position:0%
uh the cost of Medical Treatments and
 
01:59:04.470 --> 01:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
where they're
 
01:59:06.709 --> 01:59:06.719 align:start position:0%
delivered the best in the best in the
 
01:59:09.350 --> 01:59:09.360 align:start position:0%
nation we we we've done one of one of
 
01:59:10.950 --> 01:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
the holes there and it's a hole that's
 
01:59:13.229 --> 01:59:13.239 align:start position:0%
growing and and continues to grow is
 
01:59:16.430 --> 01:59:16.440 align:start position:0%
that self-insured groups do not have to
 
01:59:19.830 --> 01:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
participate in the claims database and
 
01:59:22.669 --> 01:59:22.679 align:start position:0%
so this is a carrot and a stick to say
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
self-insured groups if you'll help us
 
01:59:26.589 --> 01:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
collect your data if you're willing to
 
01:59:29.750 --> 01:59:29.760 align:start position:0%
have us do that great right and that's
 
01:59:31.470 --> 01:59:31.480 align:start position:0%
what we that's what is a state we want
 
01:59:34.189 --> 01:59:34.199 align:start position:0%
the best claims database in return we'll
 
01:59:36.990 --> 01:59:37.000 align:start position:0%
give you some data back so that you
 
01:59:39.990 --> 01:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
understand what your what portion of
 
01:59:45.750 --> 01:59:45.760 align:start position:0%
your fully insured uh expenses or your
 
01:59:48.310 --> 01:59:48.320 align:start position:0%
claims data as opposed to administrative
 
01:59:50.950 --> 01:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
expenses as opposed to other costs and
 
01:59:52.510 --> 01:59:52.520 align:start position:0%
and I would just add to that cuz I think
 
01:59:54.350 --> 01:59:54.360 align:start position:0%
what representative miles was concerned
 
01:59:58.069 --> 01:59:58.079 align:start position:0%
about was is there proprietary in
 
02:00:01.550 --> 02:00:01.560 align:start position:0%
correct or orable protected informable
 
02:00:03.430 --> 02:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
information I'll use that broad term
 
02:00:06.470 --> 02:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
protected information that would be made
 
02:00:08.870 --> 02:00:08.880 align:start position:0%
available to the
 
02:00:11.310 --> 02:00:11.320 align:start position:0%
company as part of the carrot stick
 
02:00:12.950 --> 02:00:12.960 align:start position:0%
approach to get them to voluntarily give
 
02:00:14.990 --> 02:00:15.000 align:start position:0%
the data to which I would say absolutely
 
02:00:18.669 --> 02:00:18.679 align:start position:0%
not we have very strict confidentiality
 
02:00:21.629 --> 02:00:21.639 align:start position:0%
requirements currently in statute what
 
02:00:23.709 --> 02:00:23.719 align:start position:0%
that would look like is anything that
 
02:00:27.109 --> 02:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
could be anonymized and aggregated it
 
02:00:28.510 --> 02:00:28.520 align:start position:0%
would not be
 
02:00:31.510 --> 02:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
specific to XY orz employee that's
 
02:00:34.189 --> 02:00:34.199 align:start position:0%
protected that is currently protected we
 
02:00:36.910 --> 02:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot of very sensitive protected
 
02:00:38.750 --> 02:00:38.760 align:start position:0%
proprietary data that we collect as a
 
02:00:41.589 --> 02:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
department at present but it because
 
02:00:43.350 --> 02:00:43.360 align:start position:0%
you've got those
 
02:00:45.870 --> 02:00:45.880 align:start position:0%
confidentiality provisions on the books
 
02:00:48.910 --> 02:00:48.920 align:start position:0%
it dictates how we're able to share with
 
02:00:48.920 --> 02:00:49.669 align:start position:0%
it dictates how we're able to share with
the

02:00:49.669 --> 02:00:49.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:00:52.550 --> 02:00:52.560 align:start position:0%
public the data that we've got
 
02:00:54.870 --> 02:00:54.880 align:start position:0%
so so are you saying that you are you
 
02:00:57.669 --> 02:00:57.679 align:start position:0%
saying that the data being provided will
 
02:00:59.109 --> 02:00:59.119 align:start position:0%
be an aggregate
 
02:01:01.669 --> 02:01:01.679 align:start position:0%
data and not per part employee or per
 
02:01:03.390 --> 02:01:03.400 align:start position:0%
person absolutely it's got to be AGG
 
02:01:05.390 --> 02:01:05.400 align:start position:0%
that's right there'd be all sorts of
 
02:01:07.470 --> 02:01:07.480 align:start position:0%
violations if you started getting into
 
02:01:09.830 --> 02:01:09.840 align:start position:0%
any sort of identifiable information or
 
02:01:11.470 --> 02:01:11.480 align:start position:0%
the conditions of the indivual
 
02:01:13.870 --> 02:01:13.880 align:start position:0%
identifiable yeah that that's a very
 
02:01:16.550 --> 02:01:16.560 align:start position:0%
very clear long-established no goes on
 
02:01:18.830 --> 02:01:18.840 align:start position:0%
would you consider a minimum number of
 
02:01:22.109 --> 02:01:22.119 align:start position:0%
employees in those self-insured plans I
 
02:01:23.790 --> 02:01:23.800 align:start position:0%
these are all Rises anyway so they're
 
02:01:25.669 --> 02:01:25.679 align:start position:0%
they're going to be I mean but if like
 
02:01:28.270 --> 02:01:28.280 align:start position:0%
they can be they can be 20 employees and
 
02:01:30.629 --> 02:01:30.639 align:start position:0%
that's not hard to figure out aggregate
 
02:01:34.510 --> 02:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
data on 15 employees 20 employees it's
 
02:01:38.310 --> 02:01:38.320 align:start position:0%
not hard for the CEO to figure that out
 
02:01:40.709 --> 02:01:40.719 align:start position:0%
and to know this person's about to cost
 
02:01:44.629 --> 02:01:44.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:48.189 --> 02:01:48.199 align:start position:0%
year I in a scenario such as that I mean
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
I think that risk is present
 
02:01:53.629 --> 02:01:53.639 align:start position:0%
regardless if you're a company that
 
02:01:55.950 --> 02:01:55.960 align:start position:0%
small you know and
 
02:01:58.270 --> 02:01:58.280 align:start position:0%
somebody's become pregnant it's going to
 
02:02:00.910 --> 02:02:00.920 align:start position:0%
be obvious but fortunately we've got
 
02:02:03.069 --> 02:02:03.079 align:start position:0%
non-discrimination laws that would
 
02:02:05.709 --> 02:02:05.719 align:start position:0%
prevent that person from being let go
 
02:02:07.709 --> 02:02:07.719 align:start position:0%
for that reason of course and let's be
 
02:02:09.950 --> 02:02:09.960 align:start position:0%
candid if you're a 20 employee 20
 
02:02:12.870 --> 02:02:12.880 align:start position:0%
employee employer your option is going
 
02:02:14.270 --> 02:02:14.280 align:start position:0%
to be to go into the small group Market
 
02:02:15.669 --> 02:02:15.679 align:start position:0%
that's right so if you had that if you
 
02:02:19.550 --> 02:02:19.560 align:start position:0%
had the shock of a million dollar uh
 
02:02:21.510 --> 02:02:21.520 align:start position:0%
well employee you're going to you're
 
02:02:23.629 --> 02:02:23.639 align:start position:0%
going to shift next year to a small
 
02:02:26.830 --> 02:02:26.840 align:start position:0%
group uh plan um that's a level of risk
 
02:02:28.470 --> 02:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't want to retain as a
 
02:02:30.990 --> 02:02:31.000 align:start position:0%
business of that size and and I've
 
02:02:32.350 --> 02:02:32.360 align:start position:0%
talked about this before not only the
 
02:02:34.350 --> 02:02:34.360 align:start position:0%
small group markets going to be the more
 
02:02:38.109 --> 02:02:38.119 align:start position:0%
attractive option we are seeing a pretty
 
02:02:40.990 --> 02:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
steady migration of those small
 
02:02:43.589 --> 02:02:43.599 align:start position:0%
employers from small group Market
 
02:02:46.910 --> 02:02:46.920 align:start position:0%
into a version of the individual Market
 
02:02:49.310 --> 02:02:49.320 align:start position:0%
called ikra it's an acronym I can never
 
02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:51.440 align:start position:0%
remember what it's an acronym for where
 
02:02:53.910 --> 02:02:53.920 align:start position:0%
the employer will give the employee a
 
02:02:56.510 --> 02:02:56.520 align:start position:0%
set amount of money there are tax
 
02:02:59.510 --> 02:02:59.520 align:start position:0%
advantages to that money and then that
 
02:03:01.109 --> 02:03:01.119 align:start position:0%
individual employee goes onto the
 
02:03:03.229 --> 02:03:03.239 align:start position:0%
individual market and purchases a plan
 
02:03:05.629 --> 02:03:05.639 align:start position:0%
for themselves that's another huge Trend
 
02:03:07.790 --> 02:03:07.800 align:start position:0%
we're seeing for businesses of that size
 
02:03:09.830 --> 02:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative miles yeah it makes sense
 
02:03:11.950 --> 02:03:11.960 align:start position:0%
what the gentleman uh back there said
 
02:03:15.390 --> 02:03:15.400 align:start position:0%
about they' obviously shift in the
 
02:03:18.750 --> 02:03:18.760 align:start position:0%
upcoming year not have ongoing
 
02:03:23.430 --> 02:03:23.440 align:start position:0%
right he's a smart guy I like him
 
02:03:25.229 --> 02:03:25.239 align:start position:0%
and if we had Paula here we would have
 
02:03:26.910 --> 02:03:26.920 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners in the room at the
 
02:03:26.920 --> 02:03:28.310 align:start position:0%
three Commissioners in the room at the
same

02:03:28.310 --> 02:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
same
 
02:03:31.550 --> 02:03:31.560 align:start position:0%
time okay you you feel better about it
 
02:03:34.830 --> 02:03:34.840 align:start position:0%
how do you feel about it I I still not
 
02:03:37.390 --> 02:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
clear the purpose of providing that
 
02:03:40.189 --> 02:03:40.199 align:start position:0%
information data to employer only part I
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
heard is that that helps employer to do
 
02:03:45.350 --> 02:03:45.360 align:start position:0%
shopping around I wrong I was I was I it
 
02:03:46.990 --> 02:03:47.000 align:start position:0%
wasn't intent for chopping around it was
 
02:03:49.149 --> 02:03:49.159 align:start position:0%
more intent I guess in terms of why we
 
02:03:52.350 --> 02:03:52.360 align:start position:0%
have this database you know is is so I'm
 
02:03:54.030 --> 02:03:54.040 align:start position:0%
I'm still not clear why why there is a
 
02:03:55.950 --> 02:03:55.960 align:start position:0%
need for the employer to get the data
 
02:03:57.910 --> 02:03:57.920 align:start position:0%
from the insurance company besides the
 
02:03:59.669 --> 02:03:59.679 align:start position:0%
fact that like you said earlier that oh
 
02:04:01.270 --> 02:04:01.280 align:start position:0%
he might use that information to shop
 
02:04:03.709 --> 02:04:03.719 align:start position:0%
around to get a lesser premium which is
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
not the case apparently what is the use
 
02:04:07.510 --> 02:04:07.520 align:start position:0%
of that no he can absolutely use that
 
02:04:10.510 --> 02:04:10.520 align:start position:0%
for that purpose yeah he can use but see
 
02:04:13.030 --> 02:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes I I guess we try to pass bill
 
02:04:14.669 --> 02:04:14.679 align:start position:0%
or try to discuss bill that is not even
 
02:04:17.270 --> 02:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
necessary I I mean I like I said I'm
 
02:04:18.830 --> 02:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
still having hard to understanding the
 
02:04:21.790 --> 02:04:21.800 align:start position:0%
need of providing that information to to
 
02:04:28.830 --> 02:04:28.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:31.750 --> 02:04:31.760 align:start position:0%
employ identify what their needs for
 
02:04:33.950 --> 02:04:33.960 align:start position:0%
that colletive group are so that they're
 
02:04:36.510 --> 02:04:36.520 align:start position:0%
not over insuring
 
02:04:38.270 --> 02:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
themselves that's one of the many
 
02:04:40.189 --> 02:04:40.199 align:start position:0%
reasons again well terms of what type of
 
02:04:42.109 --> 02:04:42.119 align:start position:0%
policy they're getting and what is it
 
02:04:43.950 --> 02:04:43.960 align:start position:0%
are they in the right category over what
 
02:04:45.709 --> 02:04:45.719 align:start position:0%
they're getting all right because
 
02:04:47.629 --> 02:04:47.639 align:start position:0%
there're Rises so they're they're it's a
 
02:04:49.870 --> 02:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
free game what who they can chop around
 
02:04:51.830 --> 02:04:51.840 align:start position:0%
and what they're going to do who's in
 
02:04:53.709 --> 02:04:53.719 align:start position:0%
who's out what the deductibles what the
 
02:04:56.030 --> 02:04:56.040 align:start position:0%
co-pays normally you know when you when
 
02:04:58.350 --> 02:04:58.360 align:start position:0%
you take the um the the small group
 
02:05:00.589 --> 02:05:00.599 align:start position:0%
Market you know the only real issue is
 
02:05:02.709 --> 02:05:02.719 align:start position:0%
age banding you know and your employer
 
02:05:04.470 --> 02:05:04.480 align:start position:0%
can say you know say well if I if my
 
02:05:07.390 --> 02:05:07.400 align:start position:0%
employees I'm starting to age up you
 
02:05:08.510 --> 02:05:08.520 align:start position:0%
know I'm going to be looking for a
 
02:05:10.270 --> 02:05:10.280 align:start position:0%
different policy than if I had you know
 
02:05:13.390 --> 02:05:13.400 align:start position:0%
if I had mostly younger employees so and
 
02:05:15.510 --> 02:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of it it gives them
 
02:05:17.470 --> 02:05:17.480 align:start position:0%
some you know but it's General these are
 
02:05:19.430 --> 02:05:19.440 align:start position:0%
Big you know General numbers not
 
02:05:21.990 --> 02:05:22.000 align:start position:0%
specific to your actual case okay so it
 
02:05:23.270 --> 02:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
to help them to figure out out what
 
02:05:25.270 --> 02:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
policy suits which is more but which is
 
02:05:27.430 --> 02:05:27.440 align:start position:0%
the right policy to get exactly that's
 
02:05:29.709 --> 02:05:29.719 align:start position:0%
what I mean by shopping
 
02:05:32.549 --> 02:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
around okay feel better a little bit
 
02:05:36.750 --> 02:05:36.760 align:start position:0%
Yeah okay good okay so if the if we'll
 
02:05:38.390 --> 02:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
have an amendment for when we take this
 
02:05:40.189 --> 02:05:40.199 align:start position:0%
bill up tomorrow
 
02:05:43.750 --> 02:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
morning and uh um so I guess you would
 
02:05:45.270 --> 02:05:45.280 align:start position:0%
want to go and have this amendment drawn
 
02:05:47.470 --> 02:05:47.480 align:start position:0%
up right now so I can get over to ol
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
it's easy to do Mr chairman
 
02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
okay and simply now now this this is
 
02:05:55.069 --> 02:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
basically enabling legislation so the
 
02:05:58.350 --> 02:05:58.360 align:start position:0%
department can Implement a new program
 
02:06:02.270 --> 02:06:02.280 align:start position:0%
uh that is Catching Fire Across the
 
02:06:05.350 --> 02:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
Nation and uh uh but it will be
 
02:06:08.589 --> 02:06:08.599 align:start position:0%
dependent upon uh that that money
 
02:06:10.350 --> 02:06:10.360 align:start position:0%
Pennies from
 
02:06:12.750 --> 02:06:12.760 align:start position:0%
Heaven okay and everybody all right with
 
02:06:14.669 --> 02:06:14.679 align:start position:0%
that we'll be praying okay this is we
 
02:06:15.910 --> 02:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
can't vote on because we don't have an
 
02:06:18.510 --> 02:06:18.520 align:start position:0%
amendment to vote on uh but so that's
 
02:06:20.950 --> 02:06:20.960 align:start position:0%
that's where we're at so as as a straw
 
02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
vote are we all okay with it okay all
 
02:06:25.239 --> 02:06:27.069 align:start position:0%
vote are we all okay with it okay all
right

02:06:27.069 --> 02:06:27.079 align:start position:0%
right
 
02:06:36.430 --> 02:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:36.440 --> 02:06:43.390 align:start position:0%
 
more

02:06:43.390 --> 02:06:43.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:46.149 --> 02:06:46.159 align:start position:0%
uh I thought I I thought I had the all
 
02:06:49.910 --> 02:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:53.790 --> 02:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:53.800 --> 02:07:19.390 align:start position:0%
 
okay

02:07:19.390 --> 02:07:19.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:19.400 --> 02:07:24.069 align:start position:0%
 
 um

02:07:24.069 --> 02:07:24.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.430 --> 02:08:20.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:50.430 align:start position:0%
 
minut

02:08:50.430 --> 02:08:50.440 align:start position:0%

02:11:20.229 --> 02:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:50.229 align:start position:0%

02:15:49.910 --> 02:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:49.920 --> 02:16:19.910 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:16:19.910 --> 02:16:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:19.920 --> 02:16:49.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:16:49.830 --> 02:16:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:16:49.840 --> 02:17:19.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:17:19.830 --> 02:17:19.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:49.830 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:17:49.830 --> 02:17:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:49.840 --> 02:18:19.750 align:start position:0%
 
e

02:18:19.750 --> 02:18:19.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:03.309 --> 02:19:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:07.469 --> 02:19:07.479 align:start position:0%
okay so um this is
 
02:19:07.479 --> 02:19:09.270 align:start position:0%
okay so um this is
uh

02:19:09.270 --> 02:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
02:19:14.110 --> 02:19:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:18.309 --> 02:19:18.319 align:start position:0%
good okay um so obviously this is a much
 
02:19:21.150 --> 02:19:21.160 align:start position:0%
lighter form than the original bill uh
 
02:19:24.750 --> 02:19:24.760 align:start position:0%
the concept was that that uh if there is
 
02:19:24.760 --> 02:19:25.790 align:start position:0%
the concept was that that uh if there is
an

02:19:25.790 --> 02:19:25.800 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:19:29.389 --> 02:19:29.399 align:start position:0%
underlying uh loan Behind these these
 
02:19:31.629 --> 02:19:31.639 align:start position:0%
settlements that uh there is a
 
02:19:34.589 --> 02:19:34.599 align:start position:0%
responsibility for the uh the judge to
 
02:19:37.110 --> 02:19:37.120 align:start position:0%
be informed of the issue and then the
 
02:19:39.309 --> 02:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
judge can make a decision whether they
 
02:19:42.389 --> 02:19:42.399 align:start position:0%
share that information or not with the
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
uh opposing
 
02:19:43.599 --> 02:19:45.589 align:start position:0%
uh opposing
party

02:19:45.589 --> 02:19:45.599 align:start position:0%
party
 
02:19:49.270 --> 02:19:49.280 align:start position:0%
okay so we have someone from when you
 
02:19:52.230 --> 02:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
come on up have a seat turn mic on and
 
02:19:55.270 --> 02:19:55.280 align:start position:0%
just tell us where you want us to fix it
 
02:19:57.750 --> 02:19:57.760 align:start position:0%
and we'll fix
 
02:19:57.760 --> 02:19:59.270 align:start position:0%
and we'll fix
it

02:19:59.270 --> 02:19:59.280 align:start position:0%
it
 
02:20:01.750 --> 02:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
Anthony yeah there you go chairman my
 
02:20:03.150 --> 02:20:03.160 align:start position:0%
name is Anthony skolen brini I'm a
 
02:20:05.110 --> 02:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
lawyer in Nashua uh there are a couple
 
02:20:06.469 --> 02:20:06.479 align:start position:0%
things I wanted to point out uh the
 
02:20:08.550 --> 02:20:08.560 align:start position:0%
first thing is and I know this doesn't
 
02:20:09.790 --> 02:20:09.800 align:start position:0%
really matter but sometimes in
 
02:20:11.590 --> 02:20:11.600 align:start position:0%
legislative interpretation it does for
 
02:20:13.670 --> 02:20:13.680 align:start position:0%
the court the title is New Hampshire
 
02:20:15.150 --> 02:20:15.160 align:start position:0%
third party litigation funding
 
02:20:18.150 --> 02:20:18.160 align:start position:0%
transparency act this is not really
 
02:20:19.550 --> 02:20:19.560 align:start position:0%
third party litigation funding
 
02:20:21.110 --> 02:20:21.120 align:start position:0%
transparency because it only applies to
 
02:20:23.630 --> 02:20:23.640 align:start position:0%
one side the vast majority of civil
 
02:20:25.910 --> 02:20:25.920 align:start position:0%
cases are defended by a third party an
 
02:20:27.590 --> 02:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
insurance company and there's no
 
02:20:29.150 --> 02:20:29.160 align:start position:0%
disclosure requirements here for
 
02:20:31.190 --> 02:20:31.200 align:start position:0%
insurance companies so to the extent
 
02:20:33.429 --> 02:20:33.439 align:start position:0%
that this is about transparency funding
 
02:20:35.710 --> 02:20:35.720 align:start position:0%
it should be two-sided not one-sided so
 
02:20:39.110 --> 02:20:39.120 align:start position:0%
what title would you like um I will tell
 
02:20:41.270 --> 02:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
you right now that I think that these
 
02:20:43.510 --> 02:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
this I'm speaking personally yes these
 
02:20:45.070 --> 02:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
these litigation funding people it
 
02:20:47.670 --> 02:20:47.680 align:start position:0%
should be illegal period full stop they
 
02:20:49.950 --> 02:20:49.960 align:start position:0%
should not have them at all okay I'll
 
02:20:51.389 --> 02:20:51.399 align:start position:0%
tell you a story you want to hear a
 
02:20:53.830 --> 02:20:53.840 align:start position:0%
story okay I'm happy to hear any story
 
02:20:57.469 --> 02:20:57.479 align:start position:0%
this I I said this this is a short story
 
02:20:59.670 --> 02:20:59.680 align:start position:0%
so I've been doing this for a very long
 
02:21:04.349 --> 02:21:04.359 align:start position:0%
time and I was here when we had
 
02:21:04.359 --> 02:21:06.469 align:start position:0%
time and I was here when we had
viatical

02:21:06.469 --> 02:21:06.479 align:start position:0%
viatical
 
02:21:08.910 --> 02:21:08.920 align:start position:0%
viatical do you know what a viatical is
 
02:21:12.150 --> 02:21:12.160 align:start position:0%
it sounds like a medication sir yeah it
 
02:21:16.790 --> 02:21:16.800 align:start position:0%
does you sell your life insurance policy
 
02:21:18.990 --> 02:21:19.000 align:start position:0%
and the reason we were regulating it was
 
02:21:21.469 --> 02:21:21.479 align:start position:0%
this was goes all the way back to to
 
02:21:24.990 --> 02:21:25.000 align:start position:0%
AIDS and there were a lot of AIDS people
 
02:21:28.190 --> 02:21:28.200 align:start position:0%
who were given terminal notices and they
 
02:21:30.990 --> 02:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
were selling their
 
02:21:35.270 --> 02:21:35.280 align:start position:0%
policies sure I okay yeah so to say that
 
02:21:37.790 --> 02:21:37.800 align:start position:0%
this is payday loaning you know lending
 
02:21:39.710 --> 02:21:39.720 align:start position:0%
you know doing where all the you know as
 
02:21:43.030 --> 02:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
far as I'm concerned is that um I've
 
02:21:46.630 --> 02:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
never ceases to amaze to me how people
 
02:21:48.110 --> 02:21:48.120 align:start position:0%
monetize their lives what what they're
 
02:21:51.790 --> 02:21:51.800 align:start position:0%
going to end up doing and and so this I
 
02:21:53.750 --> 02:21:53.760 align:start position:0%
and and the argument back then was you
 
02:21:55.469 --> 02:21:55.479 align:start position:0%
know for a patient that they could use
 
02:21:58.389 --> 02:21:58.399 align:start position:0%
the money to resolve issues that they
 
02:22:01.190 --> 02:22:01.200 align:start position:0%
were having before they died and so why
 
02:22:03.790 --> 02:22:03.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't they get the money all right I
 
02:22:05.670 --> 02:22:05.680 align:start position:0%
understand so so before you you know I'm
 
02:22:07.710 --> 02:22:07.720 align:start position:0%
just qualifying that for you when you go
 
02:22:09.910 --> 02:22:09.920 align:start position:0%
forward be careful when you say that
 
02:22:14.630 --> 02:22:14.640 align:start position:0%
because that um and the reason why
 
02:22:18.630 --> 02:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
um I my wife made the comment as that we
 
02:22:20.750 --> 02:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
don't want the the person who who has
 
02:22:22.910 --> 02:22:22.920 align:start position:0%
been harmed you know that that that that
 
02:22:25.190 --> 02:22:25.200 align:start position:0%
once again they're being harmed again
 
02:22:27.510 --> 02:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
you know in terms of you know we want to
 
02:22:30.990 --> 02:22:31.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that that that you know if
 
02:22:32.429 --> 02:22:32.439 align:start position:0%
because this is available this has
 
02:22:34.270 --> 02:22:34.280 align:start position:0%
happened we don't want them to feel that
 
02:22:35.950 --> 02:22:35.960 align:start position:0%
once again the state is you know taking
 
02:22:37.630 --> 02:22:37.640 align:start position:0%
advantage you know of the of the person
 
02:22:39.950 --> 02:22:39.960 align:start position:0%
so oh I totally agree okay that's why I
 
02:22:41.630 --> 02:22:41.640 align:start position:0%
said personally I I don't think I'd have
 
02:22:42.710 --> 02:22:42.720 align:start position:0%
enough certain well then keep the
 
02:22:44.150 --> 02:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
personal stuff out there yeah okay okay
 
02:22:45.950 --> 02:22:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's right all right so I'm always I'm
 
02:22:48.750 --> 02:22:48.760 align:start position:0%
I'm usually I'm a big U have a problem
 
02:22:50.550 --> 02:22:50.560 align:start position:0%
with the section ones which is the
 
02:22:51.870 --> 02:22:51.880 align:start position:0%
purpose and
 
02:22:56.710 --> 02:22:56.720 align:start position:0%
findings um so is in there really to
 
02:23:00.309 --> 02:23:00.319 align:start position:0%
this is how disclosure funding
 
02:23:00.319 --> 02:23:02.150 align:start position:0%
this is how disclosure funding
company

02:23:02.150 --> 02:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
company
 
02:23:04.550 --> 02:23:04.560 align:start position:0%
so third party you know that's what it
 
02:23:06.230 --> 02:23:06.240 align:start position:0%
is it's a third party litigation I mean
 
02:23:08.190 --> 02:23:08.200 align:start position:0%
we just don't have enough of this in the
 
02:23:10.710 --> 02:23:10.720 align:start position:0%
state to make a real like it's not a big
 
02:23:13.190 --> 02:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
deal yet maybe it will
 
02:23:16.510 --> 02:23:16.520 align:start position:0%
be it's seemingly is well because we we
 
02:23:19.110 --> 02:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
have a problem with our nonprofits now
 
02:23:20.910 --> 02:23:20.920 align:start position:0%
you know getting getting insurance you
 
02:23:23.630 --> 02:23:23.640 align:start position:0%
know and so yeah this this issue is out
 
02:23:26.230 --> 02:23:26.240 align:start position:0%
there I I I that's a different issue but
 
02:23:28.510 --> 02:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
I will say that like from my perspective
 
02:23:30.190 --> 02:23:30.200 align:start position:0%
this has really only cropped up recently
 
02:23:32.550 --> 02:23:32.560 align:start position:0%
with the YDC settlement claims yes and
 
02:23:33.910 --> 02:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
that's primarily where all of this is
 
02:23:36.190 --> 02:23:36.200 align:start position:0%
coming from but like I think that you
 
02:23:38.230 --> 02:23:38.240 align:start position:0%
know that's a fund that has a Sunset and
 
02:23:40.309 --> 02:23:40.319 align:start position:0%
when that's gone I don't see why it
 
02:23:42.550 --> 02:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
would not revert back to normal I I
 
02:23:43.630 --> 02:23:43.640 align:start position:0%
think that there's a lot of people that
 
02:23:45.710 --> 02:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
are carpet bagging into New Hampshire to
 
02:23:47.590 --> 02:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
take advantage of the settlement fund
 
02:23:50.230 --> 02:23:50.240 align:start position:0%
and these people are one of them and and
 
02:23:50.240 --> 02:23:51.070 align:start position:0%
and these people are one of them and and
um

02:23:51.070 --> 02:23:51.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:23:54.110 --> 02:23:54.120 align:start position:0%
I at the end of the day the idea here is
 
02:23:55.870 --> 02:23:55.880 align:start position:0%
you know we're not putting this to the
 
02:23:57.469 --> 02:23:57.479 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office like you're
 
02:23:59.429 --> 02:23:59.439 align:start position:0%
original right this is to the judge and
 
02:24:01.670 --> 02:24:01.680 align:start position:0%
the judge can make a decision on the
 
02:24:03.030 --> 02:24:03.040 align:start position:0%
appropriateness of you know the
 
02:24:04.429 --> 02:24:04.439 align:start position:0%
situation that's that's one thing I want
 
02:24:07.030 --> 02:24:07.040 align:start position:0%
to make sure um okay it does say all
 
02:24:09.110 --> 02:24:09.120 align:start position:0%
parties so accept as otherwise
 
02:24:10.950 --> 02:24:10.960 align:start position:0%
stipulated by order of the Court a claim
 
02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
it a claim it shall where are you tell
 
02:24:14.790 --> 02:24:14.800 align:start position:0%
me where you are I'm sorry this is uh
 
02:24:20.110 --> 02:24:20.120 align:start position:0%
page three line 22 23 and 24 without
 
02:24:21.790 --> 02:24:21.800 align:start position:0%
waiting all parties inde pending action
 
02:24:24.469 --> 02:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
so what what Roman numeral you one or
 
02:24:28.429 --> 02:24:28.439 align:start position:0%
line the line number 22 23 22 except is
 
02:24:28.439 --> 02:24:30.190 align:start position:0%
line the line number 22 23 22 except is
otherwise

02:24:30.190 --> 02:24:30.200 align:start position:0%
otherwise
 
02:24:33.230 --> 02:24:33.240 align:start position:0%
typ it seems like it it does not apply
 
02:24:35.830 --> 02:24:35.840 align:start position:0%
to just the court without waiting a
 
02:24:38.429 --> 02:24:38.439 align:start position:0%
discovery all parties in
 
02:24:41.670 --> 02:24:41.680 align:start position:0%
appending the time
 
02:24:41.680 --> 02:24:43.790 align:start position:0%
appending the time
okay

02:24:43.790 --> 02:24:43.800 align:start position:0%
okay
 
02:24:48.030 --> 02:24:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:51.309 --> 02:24:51.319 align:start position:0%
hasn't okay so if if it went to the
 
02:24:52.910 --> 02:24:52.920 align:start position:0%
court and was subject to incam review it
 
02:24:54.710 --> 02:24:54.720 align:start position:0%
might be a little different I I think
 
02:24:56.950 --> 02:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
that that would be I mean having done
 
02:24:59.710 --> 02:24:59.720 align:start position:0%
hundreds of pieces of in camera in
 
02:25:02.269 --> 02:25:02.279 align:start position:0%
camera review litigation I cannot ever
 
02:25:03.950 --> 02:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
see a judge saying that this would be
 
02:25:05.349 --> 02:25:05.359 align:start position:0%
relevant for anything I mean it just
 
02:25:07.150 --> 02:25:07.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't have any bearing on the case in
 
02:25:09.870 --> 02:25:09.880 align:start position:0%
the same way that plan law I'll stop
 
02:25:11.349 --> 02:25:11.359 align:start position:0%
saying that plainist lawyers are
 
02:25:13.469 --> 02:25:13.479 align:start position:0%
precluded from saying that this person
 
02:25:15.790 --> 02:25:15.800 align:start position:0%
is actually an insurance company the
 
02:25:17.550 --> 02:25:17.560 align:start position:0%
litigation financing has no bearing on
 
02:25:19.870 --> 02:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
the facts of the law um so here's
 
02:25:21.510 --> 02:25:21.520 align:start position:0%
another point that I want to make okay
 
02:25:24.429 --> 02:25:24.439 align:start position:0%
uh same page lines 10 through 12
 
02:25:26.190 --> 02:25:26.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph two
 
02:25:28.870 --> 02:25:28.880 align:start position:0%
okay and then the the next one paragraph
 
02:25:32.349 --> 02:25:32.359 align:start position:0%
three this imposes a lot of rules on the
 
02:25:34.030 --> 02:25:34.040 align:start position:0%
attorney client relationship that I feel
 
02:25:35.510 --> 02:25:35.520 align:start position:0%
are really invasive and so let me give
 
02:25:37.870 --> 02:25:37.880 align:start position:0%
you an example there are often times
 
02:25:40.429 --> 02:25:40.439 align:start position:0%
when we have rare cases uh for example
 
02:25:43.070 --> 02:25:43.080 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire 1983 litigation is
 
02:25:45.230 --> 02:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
relatively rare and in other states
 
02:25:47.070 --> 02:25:47.080 align:start position:0%
because they have larger populations the
 
02:25:49.870 --> 02:25:49.880 align:start position:0%
number of cases is much larger and often
 
02:25:51.510 --> 02:25:51.520 align:start position:0%
times you want to do for your client is
 
02:25:52.990 --> 02:25:53.000 align:start position:0%
to give them essentially like a real
 
02:25:56.030 --> 02:25:56.040 align:start position:0%
estate comp and say these things usually
 
02:25:58.030 --> 02:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
result in this kind of finding and we've
 
02:26:01.150 --> 02:26:01.160 align:start position:0%
normalized it and based this judgment on
 
02:26:03.550 --> 02:26:03.560 align:start position:0%
a statistically valid sample of cases
 
02:26:05.510 --> 02:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
from other jurisdictions sometimes
 
02:26:07.429 --> 02:26:07.439 align:start position:0%
that's really hard to do like the rarer
 
02:26:08.710 --> 02:26:08.720 align:start position:0%
the case the rarer the kind of
 
02:26:10.670 --> 02:26:10.680 align:start position:0%
litigation the more difficult it is to
 
02:26:12.630 --> 02:26:12.640 align:start position:0%
find that information so which specific
 
02:26:13.910 --> 02:26:13.920 align:start position:0%
part so that's what I'm saying the
 
02:26:15.910 --> 02:26:15.920 align:start position:0%
litigation uh the commercial litigation
 
02:26:17.710 --> 02:26:17.720 align:start position:0%
financer should not make any decisions
 
02:26:19.830 --> 02:26:19.840 align:start position:0%
have any influence or any direct or
 
02:26:22.710 --> 02:26:22.720 align:start position:0%
direct decisions I'm I could imagine a
 
02:26:24.190 --> 02:26:24.200 align:start position:0%
scenario where somebody who's good at
 
02:26:25.670 --> 02:26:25.680 align:start position:0%
this would have that database and I
 
02:26:27.710 --> 02:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
would ask them and the law precludes
 
02:26:30.230 --> 02:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
them from having any influence it might
 
02:26:31.469 --> 02:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
it might be something that my client
 
02:26:33.590 --> 02:26:33.600 align:start position:0%
needs to have to make a decision and
 
02:26:35.150 --> 02:26:35.160 align:start position:0%
there aren't enough lawyers in New
 
02:26:37.230 --> 02:26:37.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that do this kind of work to
 
02:26:39.349 --> 02:26:39.359 align:start position:0%
give them a relevant sample size of
 
02:26:41.230 --> 02:26:41.240 align:start position:0%
similar cases that were settled or
 
02:26:43.469 --> 02:26:43.479 align:start position:0%
resulted in verdicts of trial so I think
 
02:26:45.230 --> 02:26:45.240 align:start position:0%
that this is one of those things it's
 
02:26:48.110 --> 02:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
just too invasive and then the last
 
02:26:50.510 --> 02:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
sentence of paragraph three there is no
 
02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:52.880 align:start position:0%
reason to state that that is the default
 
02:26:56.269 --> 02:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
and so this is sort of again making a
 
02:26:57.510 --> 02:26:57.520 align:start position:0%
problem out of something that's not
 
02:26:59.429 --> 02:26:59.439 align:start position:0%
actually a problem you have an ethical
 
02:27:00.910 --> 02:27:00.920 align:start position:0%
obligation of the rules of professional
 
02:27:03.630 --> 02:27:03.640 align:start position:0%
conduct to do this anyway and there's
 
02:27:05.590 --> 02:27:05.600 align:start position:0%
nothing that the litigation funding
 
02:27:08.349 --> 02:27:08.359 align:start position:0%
source could do to change your ethical
 
02:27:10.150 --> 02:27:10.160 align:start position:0%
obligations uh there's no amount of
 
02:27:11.630 --> 02:27:11.640 align:start position:0%
money that's worth my borrow license
 
02:27:13.269 --> 02:27:13.279 align:start position:0%
because my borrow license is how I make
 
02:27:15.309 --> 02:27:15.319 align:start position:0%
money in the future so like it just
 
02:27:18.190 --> 02:27:18.200 align:start position:0%
doesn't matter okay right so we're we're
 
02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:19.640 align:start position:0%
talking about the right to make all
 
02:27:21.590 --> 02:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
decisions regarding a legal claim
 
02:27:23.469 --> 02:27:23.479 align:start position:0%
remains solely with the claimant and the
 
02:27:26.870 --> 02:27:26.880 align:start position:0%
claimant attorney or Law Firm correct
 
02:27:28.590 --> 02:27:28.600 align:start position:0%
which is stating the obvious it's
 
02:27:30.150 --> 02:27:30.160 align:start position:0%
stating the obvious but it's also
 
02:27:33.389 --> 02:27:33.399 align:start position:0%
important to remember that this idea is
 
02:27:35.110 --> 02:27:35.120 align:start position:0%
mandated in the rules of professional
 
02:27:38.429 --> 02:27:38.439 align:start position:0%
conduct and so if there is something
 
02:27:39.950 --> 02:27:39.960 align:start position:0%
that would come in Conflict to the rules
 
02:27:42.110 --> 02:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
of professional conduct right then I
 
02:27:43.750 --> 02:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
think it's incumbent to figure out how
 
02:27:45.550 --> 02:27:45.560 align:start position:0%
it would do so in you know as many cases
 
02:27:47.750 --> 02:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
as we could foresee here I think like we
 
02:27:49.950 --> 02:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
don't need to State this I think that
 
02:27:49.960 --> 02:27:50.910 align:start position:0%
don't need to State this I think that
this

02:27:50.910 --> 02:27:50.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
02:27:53.190 --> 02:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
particular paragraph is especially
 
02:27:55.550 --> 02:27:55.560 align:start position:0%
invasive and it's trying to Tinker with
 
02:27:57.429 --> 02:27:57.439 align:start position:0%
something that fundamentally is a really
 
02:27:59.590 --> 02:27:59.600 align:start position:0%
private relationship but if it rather
 
02:28:01.790 --> 02:28:01.800 align:start position:0%
than removing the whole paragraph
 
02:28:03.510 --> 02:28:03.520 align:start position:0%
because I assume the whole paragraph is
 
02:28:06.830 --> 02:28:06.840 align:start position:0%
not a pu a p p what remember
 
02:28:09.309 --> 02:28:09.319 align:start position:0%
professional conduct no no just the last
 
02:28:11.550 --> 02:28:11.560 align:start position:0%
sentence is the problem professional
 
02:28:14.550 --> 02:28:14.560 align:start position:0%
conduct okay all right so starting in
 
02:28:14.560 --> 02:28:15.910 align:start position:0%
conduct okay all right so starting in
line

02:28:15.910 --> 02:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
line
 
02:28:20.670 --> 02:28:20.680 align:start position:0%
16 the last sentence uh
 
02:28:22.870 --> 02:28:22.880 align:start position:0%
the right to make all decisions yeah you
 
02:28:24.349 --> 02:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
I think got that
 
02:28:26.750 --> 02:28:26.760 align:start position:0%
Christian okay we'll stke that and then
 
02:28:28.710 --> 02:28:28.720 align:start position:0%
the the other one in in the same
 
02:28:32.150 --> 02:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh 13 have any influence is
 
02:28:34.710 --> 02:28:34.720 align:start position:0%
such a broad phrase again I can think of
 
02:28:36.750 --> 02:28:36.760 align:start position:0%
situations in which so where are you now
 
02:28:39.550 --> 02:28:39.560 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry same paragraph line 13 have
 
02:28:41.830 --> 02:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
any influence it's the second of the
 
02:28:44.870 --> 02:28:44.880 align:start position:0%
parenthetical phrases after commercial
 
02:28:46.190 --> 02:28:46.200 align:start position:0%

02:29:05.590 --> 02:29:05.600 align:start position:0%
settlement or other resolutions so like
 
02:29:07.230 --> 02:29:07.240 align:start position:0%
let me give you a very simple example
 
02:29:08.790 --> 02:29:08.800 align:start position:0%
and we don't deal with this again
 
02:29:09.950 --> 02:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
because I don't take cases with
 
02:29:11.790 --> 02:29:11.800 align:start position:0%
litigation financing but there are
 
02:29:13.389 --> 02:29:13.399 align:start position:0%
instances in which I I want to have my
 
02:29:15.429 --> 02:29:15.439 align:start position:0%
client have a structured settlement and
 
02:29:16.750 --> 02:29:16.760 align:start position:0%
oftentimes the structured settlement
 
02:29:18.990 --> 02:29:19.000 align:start position:0%
people will provide advice here that I
 
02:29:21.150 --> 02:29:21.160 align:start position:0%
could see a commercial litigation
 
02:29:23.750 --> 02:29:23.760 align:start position:0%
financer also providing and I would not
 
02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:25.399 align:start position:0%
want to preclude my client from having
 
02:29:27.630 --> 02:29:27.640 align:start position:0%
the option of having settlement advice
 
02:29:29.389 --> 02:29:29.399 align:start position:0%
from somebody who does it professionally
 
02:29:31.429 --> 02:29:31.439 align:start position:0%
in the same way that I would not want to
 
02:29:33.950 --> 02:29:33.960 align:start position:0%
preclude my ability to access these
 
02:29:36.190 --> 02:29:36.200 align:start position:0%
people's information in a way that might
 
02:29:38.030 --> 02:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
have any influence because that's a
 
02:29:40.790 --> 02:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
really broad phrase and how I advise my
 
02:29:43.070 --> 02:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
client when when you don't when you have
 
02:29:45.710 --> 02:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
a very small state like New Hampshire
 
02:29:47.510 --> 02:29:47.520 align:start position:0%
with a
 
02:29:51.349 --> 02:29:51.359 align:start position:0%
relatively commodious civil bar there
 
02:29:53.429 --> 02:29:53.439 align:start position:0%
often times are not enough publicly
 
02:29:56.309 --> 02:29:56.319 align:start position:0%
available settlements or verdicts to
 
02:29:58.750 --> 02:29:58.760 align:start position:0%
advise clients and some of these groups
 
02:30:00.190 --> 02:30:00.200 align:start position:0%
that do this are National groups that
 
02:30:02.389 --> 02:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
could have large databases that could
 
02:30:04.469 --> 02:30:04.479 align:start position:0%
give my clients insights that I as a
 
02:30:06.750 --> 02:30:06.760 align:start position:0%
lawyer would not have access to and by
 
02:30:09.550 --> 02:30:09.560 align:start position:0%
having the phrase any influence and then
 
02:30:12.510 --> 02:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
the last one so 15 the choice or use of
 
02:30:14.150 --> 02:30:14.160 align:start position:0%
expert Witnesses litigation strategies
 
02:30:16.510 --> 02:30:16.520 align:start position:0%
or settlements I could imagine somebody
 
02:30:18.230 --> 02:30:18.240 align:start position:0%
that's a good finan uh commercial
 
02:30:21.230 --> 02:30:21.240 align:start position:0%
Finance litigation Finance here having
 
02:30:22.870 --> 02:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
all of those connections and saying to
 
02:30:26.750 --> 02:30:26.760 align:start position:0%
me Tony I know a person that does this
 
02:30:29.830 --> 02:30:29.840 align:start position:0%
very rare form of expertise do you want
 
02:30:31.830 --> 02:30:31.840 align:start position:0%
me to connect you to that person and
 
02:30:33.830 --> 02:30:33.840 align:start position:0%
under this law that's illegal even
 
02:30:35.150 --> 02:30:35.160 align:start position:0%
though I would not be able to find that
 
02:30:38.790 --> 02:30:38.800 align:start position:0%
resource myself and so I would not want
 
02:30:42.309 --> 02:30:42.319 align:start position:0%
the statute and the legislature to enter
 
02:30:45.309 --> 02:30:45.319 align:start position:0%
into the attorney client relationship on
 
02:30:50.910 --> 02:30:50.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:30:53.590 --> 02:30:53.600 align:start position:0%
of course and then the the final thing
 
02:30:56.710 --> 02:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
and this is the I'm sorry yeah I'm just
 
02:31:01.910 --> 02:31:01.920 align:start position:0%
trying to so it shall not make any
 
02:31:01.920 --> 02:31:04.469 align:start position:0%
trying to so it shall not make any
decision

02:31:04.469 --> 02:31:04.479 align:start position:0%
decision
 
02:31:04.479 --> 02:31:06.349 align:start position:0%
decision
um

02:31:06.349 --> 02:31:06.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:31:09.870 --> 02:31:09.880 align:start position:0%
changing in appointing or changing
 
02:31:13.349 --> 02:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
Council well that's really weird
 
02:31:16.830 --> 02:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
huh I mean what if say you what happens
 
02:31:18.030 --> 02:31:18.040 align:start position:0%
if you have somebody who doesn't know
 
02:31:19.389 --> 02:31:19.399 align:start position:0%
what they're doing and the commercial
 
02:31:21.630 --> 02:31:21.640 align:start position:0%
litigation financier says something to
 
02:31:23.750 --> 02:31:23.760 align:start position:0%
them in a meeting with the client like
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
did you file this motion and Limon and
 
02:31:28.670 --> 02:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
the lawyer is like o I didn't is that
 
02:31:30.550 --> 02:31:30.560 align:start position:0%
violating this statute and I think it
 
02:31:32.870 --> 02:31:32.880 align:start position:0%
probably is based on the the wording
 
02:31:36.670 --> 02:31:36.680 align:start position:0%
here because if there's any influence in
 
02:31:38.910 --> 02:31:38.920 align:start position:0%
changing Council pointing out to
 
02:31:41.309 --> 02:31:41.319 align:start position:0%
somebody you missed this filing deadline
 
02:31:43.230 --> 02:31:43.240 align:start position:0%
right that might be something the
 
02:31:45.389 --> 02:31:45.399 align:start position:0%
commercial litigation financer doesn't
 
02:31:46.830 --> 02:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
want to have happen because it means the
 
02:31:48.110 --> 02:31:48.120 align:start position:0%
case gets dismissed and they lose their
 
02:31:50.030 --> 02:31:50.040 align:start position:0%
money but at the same time it might
 
02:31:52.309 --> 02:31:52.319 align:start position:0%
functioning the client's best interest I
 
02:31:54.910 --> 02:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
think this phrase this entire paragraph
 
02:31:57.950 --> 02:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
is simply too invasive and it is not
 
02:32:00.510 --> 02:32:00.520 align:start position:0%
precise enough to deal with the the
 
02:32:02.790 --> 02:32:02.800 align:start position:0%
complexities of an attorney I'm I'm
 
02:32:04.150 --> 02:32:04.160 align:start position:0%
tending to agree with you but let's see
 
02:32:06.670 --> 02:32:06.680 align:start position:0%
what else you you have and then the last
 
02:32:08.110 --> 02:32:08.120 align:start position:0%
the last point I would make and this is
 
02:32:12.269 --> 02:32:12.279 align:start position:0%
at uh paragraph uh at lines 22 through
 
02:32:15.590 --> 02:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
lines 28 and this is again going back to
 
02:32:18.349 --> 02:32:18.359 align:start position:0%
my point about it not being symmetrical
 
02:32:19.870 --> 02:32:19.880 align:start position:0%
if we really want to provide cons
 
02:32:22.070 --> 02:32:22.080 align:start position:0%
consumers with information that protects
 
02:32:24.309 --> 02:32:24.319 align:start position:0%
them in making decisions in legal cases
 
02:32:26.670 --> 02:32:26.680 align:start position:0%
I want to know what the reserve amount
 
02:32:28.870 --> 02:32:28.880 align:start position:0%
is set by the insurance company that's
 
02:32:31.230 --> 02:32:31.240 align:start position:0%
defending the case I also want to know
 
02:32:32.990 --> 02:32:33.000 align:start position:0%
what the hourly rate is for insurance
 
02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
counsel whether they're a captured firm
 
02:32:36.150 --> 02:32:36.160 align:start position:0%
or somebody that contracts with the
 
02:32:37.950 --> 02:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
insurance Council because both of those
 
02:32:39.750 --> 02:32:39.760 align:start position:0%
things will give me information that I
 
02:32:41.870 --> 02:32:41.880 align:start position:0%
could use to advise my client about well
 
02:32:43.630 --> 02:32:43.640 align:start position:0%
you know what the reserve that they have
 
02:32:46.030 --> 02:32:46.040 align:start position:0%
for litigation is $112,000 he's going to
 
02:32:48.070 --> 02:32:48.080 align:start position:0%
settle tomorrow because my guess is he's
 
02:32:50.309 --> 02:32:50.319 align:start position:0%
at his limit so like if we're really
 
02:32:52.309 --> 02:32:52.319 align:start position:0%
going to pull this apart then I want it
 
02:32:53.870 --> 02:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
to be symmetric because it's the only
 
02:32:56.230 --> 02:32:56.240 align:start position:0%
way to keep consumers informed I I I we
 
02:32:58.510 --> 02:32:58.520 align:start position:0%
want them to have the best or you know
 
02:33:00.389 --> 02:33:00.399 align:start position:0%
they're giving up a big S part of their
 
02:33:02.230 --> 02:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
settlement sure that we want them to
 
02:33:04.030 --> 02:33:04.040 align:start position:0%
make sure they have the best counsel so
 
02:33:06.230 --> 02:33:06.240 align:start position:0%
I think that the disclosure should go go
 
02:33:09.150 --> 02:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
both ways not just with the planets what
 
02:33:10.469 --> 02:33:10.479 align:start position:0%
is it that you want to see changed in
 
02:33:11.950 --> 02:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
this paragraph I'm sorry I think it
 
02:33:15.910 --> 02:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
should be that any third party whether
 
02:33:18.070 --> 02:33:18.080 align:start position:0%
they're indemnified or not okay should
 
02:33:19.750 --> 02:33:19.760 align:start position:0%
have to make these disclosures in
 
02:33:21.710 --> 02:33:21.720 align:start position:0%
including Reserve amounts and the rate
 
02:33:24.429 --> 02:33:24.439 align:start position:0%
for hour the hourly rate for Council
 
02:33:28.429 --> 02:33:28.439 align:start position:0%
retained they'll never agree to do
 
02:33:30.630 --> 02:33:30.640 align:start position:0%
that well I would just want to point out
 
02:33:33.150 --> 02:33:33.160 align:start position:0%
the fact that this is completely
 
02:33:35.830 --> 02:33:35.840 align:start position:0%
one-sided and if we ask them to do what
 
02:33:37.389 --> 02:33:37.399 align:start position:0%
this law is asking plaintiff lawyers to
 
02:33:39.389 --> 02:33:39.399 align:start position:0%
do they will never agree to it because
 
02:33:41.550 --> 02:33:41.560 align:start position:0%
it is supposed to be one-sided but if
 
02:33:42.870 --> 02:33:42.880 align:start position:0%
you want to if you want to change the
 
02:33:44.750 --> 02:33:44.760 align:start position:0%
language to make it like you want to
 
02:33:46.750 --> 02:33:46.760 align:start position:0%
make it fair yeah make you want to have
 
02:33:48.150 --> 02:33:48.160 align:start position:0%
them both pointing guns at each other
 
02:33:50.590 --> 02:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
let's do it make them maybe we'll scare
 
02:33:52.790 --> 02:33:52.800 align:start position:0%
them away so they won't do us okay I'm
 
02:33:55.150 --> 02:33:55.160 align:start position:0%
happy to do that okay so what what what
 
02:33:56.670 --> 02:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
what words do you want me to change here
 
02:33:58.870 --> 02:33:58.880 align:start position:0%
so if we had any commercial financing
 
02:34:00.990 --> 02:34:01.000 align:start position:0%
agreement and then a SE separate
 
02:34:03.469 --> 02:34:03.479 align:start position:0%
sentence that would essentially say
 
02:34:05.429 --> 02:34:05.439 align:start position:0%
indemnified parties are under similar
 
02:34:07.230 --> 02:34:07.240 align:start position:0%
obligations including the disclosure of
 
02:34:09.630 --> 02:34:09.640 align:start position:0%
Reserve amounts that's a really big
 
02:34:11.309 --> 02:34:11.319 align:start position:0%
legal phrase for
 
02:34:13.870 --> 02:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
me you're you're adding a new sentence
 
02:34:18.389 --> 02:34:18.399 align:start position:0%
into it sure right y okay um you have a
 
02:34:19.510 --> 02:34:19.520 align:start position:0%
piece of paper and you want to write
 
02:34:30.429 --> 02:34:30.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:41.910 --> 02:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:44.030 --> 02:34:44.040 align:start position:0%
okay okay do you understand what he's
 
02:34:45.750 --> 02:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
doing he's
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
saying and do you have a is it is it is
 
02:34:52.790 --> 02:34:52.800 align:start position:0%
it fair that we have both sides and be
 
02:34:55.030 --> 02:34:55.040 align:start position:0%
equal in this you you should probably
 
02:34:57.910 --> 02:34:57.920 align:start position:0%
sit up here with a mic okay this is how
 
02:34:59.550 --> 02:34:59.560 align:start position:0%
I like to doing things I want to have
 
02:35:02.670 --> 02:35:02.680 align:start position:0%
left and right I like both
 
02:35:04.950 --> 02:35:04.960 align:start position:0%
sides and I and I noticed that Lindsay
 
02:35:07.070 --> 02:35:07.080 align:start position:0%
and George left so I didn't see you over
 
02:35:09.510 --> 02:35:09.520 align:start position:0%
there um so for the record I'm cam La
 
02:35:11.590 --> 02:35:11.600 align:start position:0%
Pine I work at Orin Reno with George and
 
02:35:13.710 --> 02:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
Lindsay we represent the New Hampshire
 
02:35:15.030 --> 02:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
Association of domestic insurance
 
02:35:16.349 --> 02:35:16.359 align:start position:0%
companies and the American Property
 
02:35:17.550 --> 02:35:17.560 align:start position:0%
casual Insurance
 
02:35:21.550 --> 02:35:21.560 align:start position:0%
Association right okay
 
02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:23.120 align:start position:0%
that that was a whole lot that was just
 
02:35:26.230 --> 02:35:26.240 align:start position:0%
said um okay so do you have are you
 
02:35:28.790 --> 02:35:28.800 align:start position:0%
overly offended by us moving that Roman
 
02:35:31.030 --> 02:35:31.040 align:start position:0%
numeral 3 section and we haven't agreed
 
02:35:34.830 --> 02:35:34.840 align:start position:0%
to it yet but sure so there is the right
 
02:35:37.429 --> 02:35:37.439 align:start position:0%
to make all decisions there is a there
 
02:35:39.190 --> 02:35:39.200 align:start position:0%
are cases there's one case in particular
 
02:35:40.870 --> 02:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
that I have in my head right now
 
02:35:43.630 --> 02:35:43.640 align:start position:0%
involving Cisco the big food supplier
 
02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:45.349 align:start position:0%
involving Cisco the big food supplier
company

02:35:45.349 --> 02:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
company
 
02:35:48.750 --> 02:35:48.760 align:start position:0%
um a they were involved in a litigation
 
02:35:50.230 --> 02:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
that involved third party litigation
 
02:35:52.269 --> 02:35:52.279 align:start position:0%
financing from berford Capital which is
 
02:35:54.990 --> 02:35:55.000 align:start position:0%
one of the largest funds that
 
02:35:58.150 --> 02:35:58.160 align:start position:0%
participate in tplf Cisco wanted to
 
02:36:00.670 --> 02:36:00.680 align:start position:0%
settle the case they wanted to end the
 
02:36:03.070 --> 02:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
case right berford would not allow them
 
02:36:05.950 --> 02:36:05.960 align:start position:0%
to do that because of their contractual
 
02:36:09.510 --> 02:36:09.520 align:start position:0%
obligation for the funding um
 
02:36:13.309 --> 02:36:13.319 align:start position:0%
so in it's an extreme example but there
 
02:36:17.150 --> 02:36:17.160 align:start position:0%
are situations where t uh third party
 
02:36:18.830 --> 02:36:18.840 align:start position:0%
litigation financing companies are
 
02:36:20.670 --> 02:36:20.680 align:start position:0%
exerting influence on cases and we don't
 
02:36:22.590 --> 02:36:22.600 align:start position:0%
want that to happen so I think removing
 
02:36:25.469 --> 02:36:25.479 align:start position:0%
that sentence would would be a problem
 
02:36:28.469 --> 02:36:28.479 align:start position:0%
be a problem would be a problem yes can
 
02:36:31.030 --> 02:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
I ask a question to Cameron yeah in that
 
02:36:32.389 --> 02:36:32.399 align:start position:0%
case what did the lawyer do because I
 
02:36:34.830 --> 02:36:34.840 align:start position:0%
think that that's probably I mean I I
 
02:36:37.150 --> 02:36:37.160 align:start position:0%
don't know the the details of that but
 
02:36:39.550 --> 02:36:39.560 align:start position:0%
just in that factual scenario someone
 
02:36:42.389 --> 02:36:42.399 align:start position:0%
else someone who's actually probably
 
02:36:44.910 --> 02:36:44.920 align:start position:0%
unethical if if the client says they
 
02:36:48.110 --> 02:36:48.120 align:start position:0%
want to settle as a lawyer you can't I
 
02:36:50.190 --> 02:36:50.200 align:start position:0%
mean ethically you can't you can
 
02:36:53.550 --> 02:36:53.560 align:start position:0%
withdraw from the case but you can't
 
02:36:55.630 --> 02:36:55.640 align:start position:0%
resist in order to settle I mean they
 
02:36:57.670 --> 02:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
have the they have an ethical right to
 
02:37:00.070 --> 02:37:00.080 align:start position:0%
control the goals of litigation so what
 
02:37:03.230 --> 02:37:03.240 align:start position:0%
happened so uh Nathan fennessy represent
 
02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:06.160 align:start position:0%
AIG I'm an attorney at predy flarity uh
 
02:37:08.110 --> 02:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
so what happened in that case was the
 
02:37:11.269 --> 02:37:11.279 align:start position:0%
thirdparty finance Year got itself
 
02:37:14.150 --> 02:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
substituted into the litigation and took
 
02:37:17.110 --> 02:37:17.120 align:start position:0%
Cisco's place and so they became the
 
02:37:19.070 --> 02:37:19.080 align:start position:0%
party in interest and took complete
 
02:37:23.710 --> 02:37:23.720 align:start position:0%
control of litigation so again that's a
 
02:37:28.550 --> 02:37:28.560 align:start position:0%
a situation that is uh is
 
02:37:31.910 --> 02:37:31.920 align:start position:0%
isied or were they third party or they
 
02:37:33.870 --> 02:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
financiers they took they were the
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
finance year and then took over their
 
02:37:37.750 --> 02:37:37.760 align:start position:0%
position in litigation I I want to ask
 
02:37:40.469 --> 02:37:40.479 align:start position:0%
you a specific question again were they
 
02:37:42.750 --> 02:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
indemnified because that's a difference
 
02:37:44.150 --> 02:37:44.160 align:start position:0%
right if they're indemnified they're
 
02:37:45.790 --> 02:37:45.800 align:start position:0%
allowed to do that because they become
 
02:37:48.150 --> 02:37:48.160 align:start position:0%
the client but then they're not
 
02:37:50.710 --> 02:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
litigation financiers at that
 
02:37:53.670 --> 02:37:53.680 align:start position:0%
point I don't know specifically but I'm
 
02:37:55.510 --> 02:37:55.520 align:start position:0%
I'm telling you that the third party
 
02:37:58.190 --> 02:37:58.200 align:start position:0%
Finance year took over the litigation
 
02:38:01.550 --> 02:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
from the the awk don't you think that's
 
02:38:02.750 --> 02:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
kind of awkward that seems a little
 
02:38:05.469 --> 02:38:05.479 align:start position:0%
awkward to me I I think that like you
 
02:38:07.830 --> 02:38:07.840 align:start position:0%
what you want to say you have
 
02:38:12.469 --> 02:38:12.479 align:start position:0%
some U yeah pull mic so just just to
 
02:38:14.030 --> 02:38:14.040 align:start position:0%
answer your question about the specifics
 
02:38:15.389 --> 02:38:15.399 align:start position:0%
of the case it was in the United States
 
02:38:18.230 --> 02:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
District Court District of Minnesota in
 
02:38:20.070 --> 02:38:20.080 align:start position:0%
regards pork an
 
02:38:22.469 --> 02:38:22.479 align:start position:0%
this goes to my joke about how you ask
 
02:38:26.710 --> 02:38:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:29.510 --> 02:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
opinions okay so Jim you have a an
 
02:38:33.190 --> 02:38:33.200 align:start position:0%
opinion on this who now in this case are
 
02:38:34.550 --> 02:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
you representing I'm representing State
 
02:38:37.190 --> 02:38:37.200 align:start position:0%
Farm and I'm always insur State Farm
 
02:38:37.200 --> 02:38:38.469 align:start position:0%
Farm and I'm always insur State Farm
nobody

02:38:38.469 --> 02:38:38.479 align:start position:0%
nobody
 
02:38:41.389 --> 02:38:41.399 align:start position:0%
else okay even though you work for a law
 
02:38:45.630 --> 02:38:45.640 align:start position:0%
firm yeah yeah a lot of us do in here
 
02:38:50.990 --> 02:38:51.000 align:start position:0%
um uh so um with respect to
 
02:38:52.750 --> 02:38:52.760 align:start position:0%
I mean we're losing the forest for the
 
02:38:55.950 --> 02:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
trees here because in article three line
 
02:38:58.910 --> 02:38:58.920 align:start position:0%
13 in page three we're really trying to
 
02:39:01.910 --> 02:39:01.920 align:start position:0%
get at is making sure that a third party
 
02:39:04.469 --> 02:39:04.479 align:start position:0%
doesn't control a litigation and the
 
02:39:08.150 --> 02:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
lawyer is in charge of advising his
 
02:39:10.990 --> 02:39:11.000 align:start position:0%
clients but in the context of a lawyer
 
02:39:14.309 --> 02:39:14.319 align:start position:0%
performing their ethical duties by have
 
02:39:17.590 --> 02:39:17.600 align:start position:0%
Frank conversations okay you don't want
 
02:39:20.150 --> 02:39:20.160 align:start position:0%
a third party calling the shot
 
02:39:23.910 --> 02:39:23.920 align:start position:0%
so I personally don't object to the
 
02:39:25.830 --> 02:39:25.840 align:start position:0%
removing the words have an influence
 
02:39:28.469 --> 02:39:28.479 align:start position:0%
because if that third party is in the
 
02:39:30.750 --> 02:39:30.760 align:start position:0%
room the lawyer can do his job he can
 
02:39:32.710 --> 02:39:32.720 align:start position:0%
tell his clients I think he's wrong but
 
02:39:35.349 --> 02:39:35.359 align:start position:0%
we're really trying to do here is
 
02:39:37.750 --> 02:39:37.760 align:start position:0%
prevent one of these litigation finances
 
02:39:39.750 --> 02:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
from sitting in the room saying you need
 
02:39:41.790 --> 02:39:41.800 align:start position:0%
to take that settlement and that can be
 
02:39:45.150 --> 02:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
coercive against the law firm that is
 
02:39:48.309 --> 02:39:48.319 align:start position:0%
actually um has taken out the litigation
 
02:39:51.870 --> 02:39:51.880 align:start position:0%
financing so the other stuff um so
 
02:39:53.429 --> 02:39:53.439 align:start position:0%
you're saying don't remove this
 
02:39:54.790 --> 02:39:54.800 align:start position:0%
paragraph no I'm not saying don't remove
 
02:39:56.830 --> 02:39:56.840 align:start position:0%
the whole paragraph but sure take out
 
02:39:59.830 --> 02:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
the words have any influence because
 
02:40:02.230 --> 02:40:02.240 align:start position:0%
frankly well how else you change that
 
02:40:03.910 --> 02:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
sentence because otherwise you're going
 
02:40:05.670 --> 02:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
to make it from a sh to a
 
02:40:10.790 --> 02:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
May shall the commercial ler shall not
 
02:40:13.389 --> 02:40:13.399 align:start position:0%
make any decision any decision or direct
 
02:40:15.190 --> 02:40:15.200 align:start position:0%
any decision right so you're you're
 
02:40:16.550 --> 02:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
basically saying you don't have the
 
02:40:20.830 --> 02:40:20.840 align:start position:0%
right to control to a third party funer
 
02:40:22.990 --> 02:40:23.000 align:start position:0%
yeah they can still participate and they
 
02:40:25.190 --> 02:40:25.200 align:start position:0%
can provide all the information that uh
 
02:40:26.429 --> 02:40:26.439 align:start position:0%
this attorney wants I'm sorry I
 
02:40:27.389 --> 02:40:27.399 align:start position:0%
forgotten your
 
02:40:30.389 --> 02:40:30.399 align:start position:0%
name don't Anthony skull breing I the
 
02:40:31.790 --> 02:40:31.800 align:start position:0%
other thing you could do is simply have
 
02:40:34.309 --> 02:40:34.319 align:start position:0%
this paragraph say the attorney retains
 
02:40:35.830 --> 02:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
the right of final refusal on any
 
02:40:38.150 --> 02:40:38.160 align:start position:0%
proposals made by commercial litigation
 
02:40:40.990 --> 02:40:41.000 align:start position:0%
financing and then it doesn't matter it
 
02:40:43.429 --> 02:40:43.439 align:start position:0%
matches and Accords with the rules of
 
02:40:45.630 --> 02:40:45.640 align:start position:0%
professional conduct Jim's concern is
 
02:40:51.150 --> 02:40:51.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:52.990 --> 02:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
say that again yeah say that again
 
02:40:56.070 --> 02:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
simply state that the attorney retains
 
02:40:57.990 --> 02:40:58.000 align:start position:0%
the right of final decision making on
 
02:40:59.670 --> 02:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
all aspects of the case that's new
 
02:41:01.750 --> 02:41:01.760 align:start position:0%
language right that's not here now no no
 
02:41:02.990 --> 02:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
that would be it and you wouldn't have
 
02:41:05.429 --> 02:41:05.439 align:start position:0%
to have this long complicated list
 
02:41:06.870 --> 02:41:06.880 align:start position:0%
talking about what they can't do but
 
02:41:09.230 --> 02:41:09.240 align:start position:0%
just say lawyer gets to make these
 
02:41:11.110 --> 02:41:11.120 align:start position:0%
decisions don't don't this doesn't
 
02:41:16.190 --> 02:41:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
02:41:19.349 --> 02:41:19.359 align:start position:0%
period the attorney retains the right of
 
02:41:20.990 --> 02:41:21.000 align:start position:0%
final decision- making on all aspects of
 
02:41:22.269 --> 02:41:22.279 align:start position:0%
the case and consultation with the
 
02:41:25.429 --> 02:41:25.439 align:start position:0%
client and that that just means that the
 
02:41:27.469 --> 02:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
rules of Ethics apply as they normally
 
02:41:30.870 --> 02:41:30.880 align:start position:0%
apply and the consumer the commercial
 
02:41:33.550 --> 02:41:33.560 align:start position:0%
litigation financer can't override
 
02:41:35.590 --> 02:41:35.600 align:start position:0%
anybody but at the same time if they
 
02:41:37.349 --> 02:41:37.359 align:start position:0%
want to collaborate and it's good for
 
02:41:39.349 --> 02:41:39.359 align:start position:0%
the client and the lawyer approves it
 
02:41:41.230 --> 02:41:41.240 align:start position:0%
they can still do that but by having
 
02:41:42.790 --> 02:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
this language that has all of these
 
02:41:44.830 --> 02:41:44.840 align:start position:0%
specific things that say you can't do
 
02:41:48.150 --> 02:41:48.160 align:start position:0%
that you're making it really invasive
 
02:41:50.429 --> 02:41:50.439 align:start position:0%
instead of saying what we wanted to say
 
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
which is the lawyer and the client still
 
02:41:53.990 --> 02:41:54.000 align:start position:0%
retain all of the decision- making in
 
02:41:54.000 --> 02:41:55.870 align:start position:0%
retain all of the decision- making in
the

02:41:55.870 --> 02:41:55.880 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:41:59.389 --> 02:41:59.399 align:start position:0%
case yeah so Place paragraph with that
 
02:42:02.910 --> 02:42:02.920 align:start position:0%
sentence so if you look at article three
 
02:42:06.030 --> 02:42:06.040 align:start position:0%
here okay right what this is intended to
 
02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
do is to say to commercial litigation
 
02:42:12.910 --> 02:42:12.920 align:start position:0%
financers you cannot control this right
 
02:42:15.230 --> 02:42:15.240 align:start position:0%
okay so if you're an attorney who wants
 
02:42:15.240 --> 02:42:16.030 align:start position:0%
okay so if you're an attorney who wants
to

02:42:16.030 --> 02:42:16.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:42:20.630 --> 02:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
retain the final decision I don't see
 
02:42:23.429 --> 02:42:23.439 align:start position:0%
what's objectionable about having a law
 
02:42:26.469 --> 02:42:26.479 align:start position:0%
that says you third party funer
 
02:42:29.790 --> 02:42:29.800 align:start position:0%
cannot direct the decision so I I don't
 
02:42:32.269 --> 02:42:32.279 align:start position:0%
see what I have in mind as being
 
02:42:34.710 --> 02:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
inconsistent with well the question is
 
02:42:38.230 --> 02:42:38.240 align:start position:0%
is that the third part is allowed to
 
02:42:41.790 --> 02:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
have an opinion right U Express a point
 
02:42:46.190 --> 02:42:46.200 align:start position:0%
of view right but that at the uh but
 
02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:48.720 align:start position:0%
that that ultimately the the final
 
02:42:52.389 --> 02:42:52.399 align:start position:0%
decision has to be made by the the
 
02:42:54.950 --> 02:42:54.960 align:start position:0%
attorney and like I I don't think like
 
02:42:57.790 --> 02:42:57.800 align:start position:0%
in principle Jim's idea of how the law
 
02:42:59.710 --> 02:42:59.720 align:start position:0%
would work and my idea of how the law
 
02:43:01.349 --> 02:43:01.359 align:start position:0%
would work irrespective of language
 
02:43:03.710 --> 02:43:03.720 align:start position:0%
would result in any different outcome
 
02:43:05.630 --> 02:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
the concern that I have is that by
 
02:43:08.590 --> 02:43:08.600 align:start position:0%
making the law so narrow and prescribed
 
02:43:10.590 --> 02:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
it makes it very invasive in a
 
02:43:13.590 --> 02:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
relationship that is complex already so
 
02:43:15.870 --> 02:43:15.880 align:start position:0%
I guess there is a point and I'm talk to
 
02:43:17.670 --> 02:43:17.680 align:start position:0%
you Brian because you're you sponsor
 
02:43:20.830 --> 02:43:20.840 align:start position:0%
that if if if we were trying to say
 
02:43:23.950 --> 02:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
what're what we're really care about now
 
02:43:27.269 --> 02:43:27.279 align:start position:0%
is to make sure that that that this loan
 
02:43:30.790 --> 02:43:30.800 align:start position:0%
is exists and and it's out there okay do
 
02:43:33.269 --> 02:43:33.279 align:start position:0%
we really care about the details of that
 
02:43:35.070 --> 02:43:35.080 align:start position:0%
relationship between those people I mean
 
02:43:37.550 --> 02:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
do we really need this stuff in here if
 
02:43:39.750 --> 02:43:39.760 align:start position:0%
we were just to keep it simple to say is
 
02:43:41.389 --> 02:43:41.399 align:start position:0%
the most important thing that we want to
 
02:43:44.070 --> 02:43:44.080 align:start position:0%
know is that yes this lawsuit ex you
 
02:43:46.910 --> 02:43:46.920 align:start position:0%
know this this uh deals exists and let's
 
02:43:49.230 --> 02:43:49.240 align:start position:0%
just get rid get rid of this because
 
02:43:50.950 --> 02:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
don't this room's not big enough for
 
02:43:52.750 --> 02:43:52.760 align:start position:0%
anym lawyers
 
02:43:55.349 --> 02:43:55.359 align:start position:0%
right just get rid of this this kind of
 
02:43:58.230 --> 02:43:58.240 align:start position:0%
stuff which is re you know identifying
 
02:43:59.830 --> 02:43:59.840 align:start position:0%
and I understand what you were trying to
 
02:44:02.190 --> 02:44:02.200 align:start position:0%
do but it is more than what we really
 
02:44:04.110 --> 02:44:04.120 align:start position:0%
you I I feel like we were trying to you
 
02:44:06.309 --> 02:44:06.319 align:start position:0%
know resolve the issue with which was
 
02:44:08.150 --> 02:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
just that it we just don't want third
 
02:44:10.349 --> 02:44:10.359 align:start position:0%
parties influencing lawsuits we don't
 
02:44:11.910 --> 02:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
want them stirring them towards
 
02:44:14.630 --> 02:44:14.640 align:start position:0%
litigation or stirring him towards other
 
02:44:15.950 --> 02:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
things or other avenues of things that
 
02:44:17.670 --> 02:44:17.680 align:start position:0%
are going to cost I understand you don't
 
02:44:19.469 --> 02:44:19.479 align:start position:0%
want that but at the end of the day what
 
02:44:21.910 --> 02:44:21.920 align:start position:0%
we're trying to do right of the get-go
 
02:44:24.230 --> 02:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
was that we at least want to make sure
 
02:44:26.830 --> 02:44:26.840 align:start position:0%
that the fact that there is that loan
 
02:44:29.030 --> 02:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
out there and that they're you know like
 
02:44:30.950 --> 02:44:30.960 align:start position:0%
when say well who's this guy why is he
 
02:44:33.429 --> 02:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
in this room okay well he represents
 
02:44:35.790 --> 02:44:35.800 align:start position:0%
them but in terms of why would we want
 
02:44:37.630 --> 02:44:37.640 align:start position:0%
to go into the statute go into the
 
02:44:41.030 --> 02:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
detail about what he can or can't do um
 
02:44:42.469 --> 02:44:42.479 align:start position:0%
you know the judge can be make that
 
02:44:43.950 --> 02:44:43.960 align:start position:0%
decision whether you think something's
 
02:44:46.309 --> 02:44:46.319 align:start position:0%
inappropriate going on but that but all
 
02:44:48.870 --> 02:44:48.880 align:start position:0%
we care about was that yes that that
 
02:44:48.880 --> 02:44:49.990 align:start position:0%
we care about was that yes that that
that

02:44:49.990 --> 02:44:50.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:44:52.710 --> 02:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
how do how do people feel feel about
 
02:44:55.230 --> 02:44:55.240 align:start position:0%
that does that make sense so maybe we
 
02:44:57.990 --> 02:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
can get rid of some of this crap the the
 
02:44:59.550 --> 02:44:59.560 align:start position:0%
one thing I wanted to point out about
 
02:45:01.550 --> 02:45:01.560 align:start position:0%
the example with the substituted
 
02:45:03.950 --> 02:45:03.960 align:start position:0%
litigation Finance here antitrust law is
 
02:45:06.469 --> 02:45:06.479 align:start position:0%
very different than anything else in the
 
02:45:08.910 --> 02:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
law it is a subsp specialty that is very
 
02:45:10.790 --> 02:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
rare those practitioners only do that
 
02:45:12.630 --> 02:45:12.640 align:start position:0%
kind of work it has to go to federal
 
02:45:14.510 --> 02:45:14.520 align:start position:0%
court and I've talked to federal judges
 
02:45:16.710 --> 02:45:16.720 align:start position:0%
when I was doing cles and they are they
 
02:45:18.790 --> 02:45:18.800 align:start position:0%
are aware of how unique and different
 
02:45:20.710 --> 02:45:20.720 align:start position:0%
that is than everything else so to pull
 
02:45:22.910 --> 02:45:22.920 align:start position:0%
an example from antitrust law in
 
02:45:25.309 --> 02:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
Minnesota in the federal district court
 
02:45:27.790 --> 02:45:27.800 align:start position:0%
to as a a reason to justify this level
 
02:45:30.469 --> 02:45:30.479 align:start position:0%
of invasiveness in the attorney client
 
02:45:32.510 --> 02:45:32.520 align:start position:0%
relationship in really basic simple
 
02:45:34.190 --> 02:45:34.200 align:start position:0%
straightforward civil cases in the state
 
02:45:36.269 --> 02:45:36.279 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire is like basically
 
02:45:37.910 --> 02:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
saying that we need to change the way a
 
02:45:39.830 --> 02:45:39.840 align:start position:0%
saddle is made because there might be a
 
02:45:42.469 --> 02:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
unicorn out there this is not the
 
02:45:44.750 --> 02:45:44.760 align:start position:0%
reality that most people deal with
 
02:45:47.750 --> 02:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
antitrust laws are very very different
 
02:45:49.830 --> 02:45:49.840 align:start position:0%
right if if if we
 
02:45:53.670 --> 02:45:53.680 align:start position:0%
just if we just got rid of paragraph six
 
02:45:59.469 --> 02:45:59.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:01.750 --> 02:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
language can we can we just get this
 
02:46:03.950 --> 02:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
over with
 
02:46:08.110 --> 02:46:08.120 align:start position:0%
today Roman numeral well it's 294 line
 
02:46:12.990 --> 02:46:13.000 align:start position:0%
six 294 F3 prohibitions related to
 
02:46:15.190 --> 02:46:15.200 align:start position:0%
commercial litigation funding on page
 
02:46:19.030 --> 02:46:19.040 align:start position:0%
three okay just get rid of
 
02:46:20.870 --> 02:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
that whole
 
02:46:23.070 --> 02:46:23.080 align:start position:0%
section can that just make your day and
 
02:46:27.550 --> 02:46:27.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:46:31.389 --> 02:46:31.399 align:start position:0%
this that that that lines 5 through 20
 
02:46:33.590 --> 02:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
so it'll be lines five
 
02:46:37.230 --> 02:46:37.240 align:start position:0%
through 20 is
 
02:46:39.750 --> 02:46:39.760 align:start position:0%
correct because we're we are not
 
02:46:42.389 --> 02:46:42.399 align:start position:0%
qualified to be be doing this
 
02:46:47.230 --> 02:46:47.240 align:start position:0%
conversation this is judiciary and so so
 
02:46:49.870 --> 02:46:49.880 align:start position:0%
I just you know and I'm I'm a big
 
02:46:53.110 --> 02:46:53.120 align:start position:0%
believer kiss can I make one pitch for
 
02:46:54.469 --> 02:46:54.479 align:start position:0%
the reason why you would want to keep
 
02:46:57.269 --> 02:46:57.279 align:start position:0%
that yes so okay I'm going to I am an
 
02:47:00.190 --> 02:47:00.200 align:start position:0%
attorney I do practice um I don't just
 
02:47:01.830 --> 02:47:01.840 align:start position:0%
hang out with you guys up here as fun as
 
02:47:05.590 --> 02:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
it is um so the reason why you would
 
02:47:07.550 --> 02:47:07.560 align:start position:0%
want to keep that language is is it's
 
02:47:09.950 --> 02:47:09.960 align:start position:0%
really informing the client it's not for
 
02:47:13.030 --> 02:47:13.040 align:start position:0%
the attorney the client is ultimately
 
02:47:15.269 --> 02:47:15.279 align:start position:0%
the one that's the decider that makes
 
02:47:18.230 --> 02:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
the decision whether or not to settle a
 
02:47:20.269 --> 02:47:20.279 align:start position:0%
case and I think in a lot of these
 
02:47:22.750 --> 02:47:22.760 align:start position:0%
situations you're you know particularly
 
02:47:24.070 --> 02:47:24.080 align:start position:0%
in I'm
 
02:47:27.590 --> 02:47:27.600 align:start position:0%
thinking a scenario where they are going
 
02:47:29.870 --> 02:47:29.880 align:start position:0%
to feel pressure both from the attorney
 
02:47:31.910 --> 02:47:31.920 align:start position:0%
and from the third-party Finance year to
 
02:47:35.150 --> 02:47:35.160 align:start position:0%
go in whatever Direction and by putting
 
02:47:37.750 --> 02:47:37.760 align:start position:0%
this into law you're giving them some
 
02:47:41.269 --> 02:47:41.279 align:start position:0%
information about what the what control
 
02:47:43.429 --> 02:47:43.439 align:start position:0%
they have and the the manner of
 
02:47:44.830 --> 02:47:44.840 align:start position:0%
influence that's
 
02:47:47.550 --> 02:47:47.560 align:start position:0%
inappropriate um in that
 
02:47:49.630 --> 02:47:49.640 align:start position:0%
relationship uh well they should make
 
02:47:51.349 --> 02:47:51.359 align:start position:0%
the decision before they take the loan
 
02:47:52.950 --> 02:47:52.960 align:start position:0%
in the first
 
02:47:56.030 --> 02:47:56.040 align:start position:0%
place then you should you know you're if
 
02:47:57.110 --> 02:47:57.120 align:start position:0%
you're taking this loan you're doing
 
02:47:58.870 --> 02:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
business with these people you got to
 
02:48:01.269 --> 02:48:01.279 align:start position:0%
know you know what their motives are and
 
02:48:03.910 --> 02:48:03.920 align:start position:0%
if you you know if you if you once to me
 
02:48:06.790 --> 02:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
you're selling your soul to this company
 
02:48:11.110 --> 02:48:11.120 align:start position:0%
yes and so that I mean you know the fact
 
02:48:14.469 --> 02:48:14.479 align:start position:0%
that you've made that decision I I I to
 
02:48:16.070 --> 02:48:16.080 align:start position:0%
then say okay now we're going to say you
 
02:48:18.030 --> 02:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
know what you can or can't do to your to
 
02:48:19.389 --> 02:48:19.399 align:start position:0%
the devil
 
02:48:21.550 --> 02:48:21.560 align:start position:0%
I guess I would just I would just say
 
02:48:23.469 --> 02:48:23.479 align:start position:0%
the circumstances under which you enter
 
02:48:25.309 --> 02:48:25.319 align:start position:0%
into like a commercial litigation
 
02:48:27.790 --> 02:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
financing tend to be sort of these like
 
02:48:29.590 --> 02:48:29.600 align:start position:0%
bet the company type pieces of
 
02:48:31.590 --> 02:48:31.600 align:start position:0%
litigation where you really you may not
 
02:48:33.630 --> 02:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
have much of a choice this is the only
 
02:48:35.870 --> 02:48:35.880 align:start position:0%
way that you can sort of proceed with
 
02:48:38.190 --> 02:48:38.200 align:start position:0%
something to keep your operation going I
 
02:48:40.110 --> 02:48:40.120 align:start position:0%
sure hope their attorney who they had
 
02:48:41.990 --> 02:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
with them before they signed up told
 
02:48:42.000 --> 02:48:42.910 align:start position:0%
with them before they signed up told
them

02:48:42.910 --> 02:48:42.920 align:start position:0%
them
 
02:48:44.990 --> 02:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
that the other thing I want to point out
 
02:48:47.510 --> 02:48:47.520 align:start position:0%
is having this in the law does not mean
 
02:48:49.269 --> 02:48:49.279 align:start position:0%
that the consumers will understand it
 
02:48:51.590 --> 02:48:51.600 align:start position:0%
any more than Banning murder in the law
 
02:48:53.910 --> 02:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
means that murders will go away so like
 
02:48:56.230 --> 02:48:56.240 align:start position:0%
I hear the logic it just it's not how
 
02:48:58.429 --> 02:48:58.439 align:start position:0%
the real world works the people who are
 
02:49:00.429 --> 02:49:00.439 align:start position:0%
in these situations are trying to figure
 
02:49:02.150 --> 02:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
out how to pay their bills and they're
 
02:49:05.910 --> 02:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
not going to go to RSA 294 F3 and be
 
02:49:08.710 --> 02:49:08.720 align:start position:0%
like now that I've read the statute and
 
02:49:10.910 --> 02:49:10.920 align:start position:0%
I'm in this huge Jam I think I want to
 
02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:13.520 align:start position:0%
tweak these things this stuff is simply
 
02:49:16.309 --> 02:49:16.319 align:start position:0%
required by the rules of Ethics all of
 
02:49:18.110 --> 02:49:18.120 align:start position:0%
the concerns that have been raised here
 
02:49:19.750 --> 02:49:19.760 align:start position:0%
are things that that competent lawyers
 
02:49:21.670 --> 02:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
have to deal with every day and not just
 
02:49:24.790 --> 02:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
the rules of Ethics I would add but the
 
02:49:26.870 --> 02:49:26.880 align:start position:0%
rules of automatic Discovery and
 
02:49:28.750 --> 02:49:28.760 align:start position:0%
disclosure Superior Court rule
 
02:49:31.870 --> 02:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
22 our T system has existed for hundreds
 
02:49:33.870 --> 02:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
of years there almost nothing new Under
 
02:49:36.309 --> 02:49:36.319 align:start position:0%
the Sun that our courts can't interpret
 
02:49:36.319 --> 02:49:38.630 align:start position:0%
the Sun that our courts can't interpret
in

02:49:38.630 --> 02:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:49:41.550 --> 02:49:41.560 align:start position:0%
cont I mean I understand you know we we
 
02:49:44.229 --> 02:49:44.239 align:start position:0%
we all know who the devil is here right
 
02:49:47.429 --> 02:49:47.439 align:start position:0%
the company that's that's uh seemingly
 
02:49:50.070 --> 02:49:50.080 align:start position:0%
taking advantage of of
 
02:49:56.349 --> 02:49:56.359 align:start position:0%
the of the plaintiff and um but I I I I
 
02:49:59.349 --> 02:49:59.359 align:start position:0%
guess I had made the decision before
 
02:50:01.309 --> 02:50:01.319 align:start position:0%
last week or whatever I said I said I
 
02:50:04.309 --> 02:50:04.319 align:start position:0%
just want to narrow this down to get
 
02:50:05.990 --> 02:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
it's let let every you know let
 
02:50:07.710 --> 02:50:07.720 align:start position:0%
everybody understand know that this this
 
02:50:09.870 --> 02:50:09.880 align:start position:0%
exists and but in terms of trying to
 
02:50:11.830 --> 02:50:11.840 align:start position:0%
educate people or how to how to set
 
02:50:14.510 --> 02:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
rules in this um yeah this is way over
 
02:50:19.870 --> 02:50:19.880 align:start position:0%
my pay grade in terms of legal Lee so
 
02:50:21.790 --> 02:50:21.800 align:start position:0%
uh and and it's going to another
 
02:50:21.800 --> 02:50:23.429 align:start position:0%
uh and and it's going to another
committee

02:50:23.429 --> 02:50:23.439 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:50:26.070 --> 02:50:26.080 align:start position:0%
right so so I don't know where it might
 
02:50:31.790 --> 02:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:50:35.389 --> 02:50:35.399 align:start position:0%
know no no no no no keep telling
 
02:50:38.990 --> 02:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
everybody fiscal note means not where it
 
02:50:40.670 --> 02:50:40.680 align:start position:0%
goes or who anything knew the fiscal
 
02:50:43.710 --> 02:50:43.720 align:start position:0%
note means that when the bill was drawn
 
02:50:50.110 --> 02:50:50.120 align:start position:0%
up that the um the drafter based on the
 
02:50:54.030 --> 02:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
rsas sent it to some Department who
 
02:50:55.469 --> 02:50:55.479 align:start position:0%
might care about
 
02:50:58.790 --> 02:50:58.800 align:start position:0%
it that's where a fiscal note comes from
 
02:51:00.510 --> 02:51:00.520 align:start position:0%
so it has nothing to do with where the
 
02:51:03.070 --> 02:51:03.080 align:start position:0%
bill goes to a second committee but did
 
02:51:04.630 --> 02:51:04.640 align:start position:0%
did this bill this bill never had any
 
02:51:08.630 --> 02:51:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:11.590 --> 02:51:11.600 align:start position:0%
right oh the secretary States was into
 
02:51:14.630 --> 02:51:14.640 align:start position:0%
it okay all right but that's already
 
02:51:17.510 --> 02:51:17.520 align:start position:0%
long gone right with this par okay yeah
 
02:51:17.520 --> 02:51:19.870 align:start position:0%
long gone right with this par okay yeah
um

02:51:19.870 --> 02:51:19.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:51:21.590 --> 02:51:21.600 align:start position:0%
what I'm playing with playing with the
 
02:51:23.349 --> 02:51:23.359 align:start position:0%
concept if we just
 
02:51:27.790 --> 02:51:27.800 align:start position:0%
remove um 294 F colon 3 prohibitions
 
02:51:32.070 --> 02:51:32.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:34.750 --> 02:51:34.760 align:start position:0%
funding no no we made the whole thing
 
02:51:38.950 --> 02:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:51:42.630 --> 02:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
that so F4 is stays there right because
 
02:51:44.110 --> 02:51:44.120 align:start position:0%
you don't have any problem with
 
02:51:46.790 --> 02:51:46.800 align:start position:0%
F4 well the note you have here is that
 
02:51:50.389 --> 02:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
it's not symmetric to make
 
02:51:55.349 --> 02:51:55.359 align:start position:0%
it by by asserting by inserting after uh
 
02:51:58.510 --> 02:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
on on line 25 on page three after the
 
02:52:00.870 --> 02:52:00.880 align:start position:0%
the phrase executed or amended uh
 
02:52:02.309 --> 02:52:02.319 align:start position:0%
insurance companies shall be required to
 
02:52:03.750 --> 02:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
make similar disclosures including
 
02:52:05.750 --> 02:52:05.760 align:start position:0%
Reserve amount litigation budget and the
 
02:52:08.389 --> 02:52:08.399 align:start position:0%
hourly rate of retained counsel and that
 
02:52:10.710 --> 02:52:10.720 align:start position:0%
way everybody's playing Fair both sides
 
02:52:11.750 --> 02:52:11.760 align:start position:0%
have to make
 
02:52:15.110 --> 02:52:15.120 align:start position:0%
disclosures so you want the insurance
 
02:52:17.550 --> 02:52:17.560 align:start position:0%
company what did you said so the
 
02:52:19.630 --> 02:52:19.640 align:start position:0%
insurance company and indemnifies the
 
02:52:22.070 --> 02:52:22.080 align:start position:0%
defendant they step in and control the
 
02:52:24.510 --> 02:52:24.520 align:start position:0%
litigation in a in in a much more
 
02:52:26.950 --> 02:52:26.960 align:start position:0%
intrusive way to be candid than the
 
02:52:28.950 --> 02:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
commercial litigation Finance here they
 
02:52:30.349 --> 02:52:30.359 align:start position:0%
can do everything because of an
 
02:52:32.030 --> 02:52:32.040 align:start position:0%
Indemnity agreement and since we're
 
02:52:35.910 --> 02:52:35.920 align:start position:0%
treating these outside third parties uh
 
02:52:38.389 --> 02:52:38.399 align:start position:0%
for protection of consumers in this law
 
02:52:40.309 --> 02:52:40.319 align:start position:0%
the question is should it only be
 
02:52:42.070 --> 02:52:42.080 align:start position:0%
one-sided and I don't think it should be
 
02:52:43.870 --> 02:52:43.880 align:start position:0%
and if we want to make it symmetrical
 
02:52:45.670 --> 02:52:45.680 align:start position:0%
then the insurance compan I'm totally
 
02:52:49.110 --> 02:52:49.120 align:start position:0%
confused here sit back um so now we're
 
02:52:51.349 --> 02:52:51.359 align:start position:0%
saying that the defendant in our case is
 
02:52:54.229 --> 02:52:54.239 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire no that is
 
02:52:56.349 --> 02:52:56.359 align:start position:0%
not correct okay the defendant is the
 
02:52:58.790 --> 02:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
the I thought was the plain the the the
 
02:53:01.030 --> 02:53:01.040 align:start position:0%
the person who's suing the state because
 
02:53:03.429 --> 02:53:03.439 align:start position:0%
they've been harmed no the the plaintiff
 
02:53:04.950 --> 02:53:04.960 align:start position:0%
is the party that does the suing that's
 
02:53:08.269 --> 02:53:08.279 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff okay okay so in this case
 
02:53:10.150 --> 02:53:10.160 align:start position:0%
this is let's have Tony come up with an
 
02:53:11.950 --> 02:53:11.960 align:start position:0%
example of say a slip and fall yeah like
 
02:53:13.750 --> 02:53:13.760 align:start position:0%
a slip and fall you go to Mark basket
 
02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:15.520 align:start position:0%
you're picking out bananas right you
 
02:53:18.150 --> 02:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
slip and fall you sue Market Basket cuz
 
02:53:19.590 --> 02:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
they didn't put that you know sticky
 
02:53:21.429 --> 02:53:21.439 align:start position:0%
felt tape down right you are the
 
02:53:23.670 --> 02:53:23.680 align:start position:0%
plaintiff Market Basket is the defend
 
02:53:26.070 --> 02:53:26.080 align:start position:0%
defendant okay so it is not it is very
 
02:53:28.550 --> 02:53:28.560 align:start position:0%
rare for the state to be the defendant
 
02:53:30.349 --> 02:53:30.359 align:start position:0%
in a case like this okay so dealing with
 
02:53:33.030 --> 02:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
a defendant yeah okay Market Basket so
 
02:53:34.309 --> 02:53:34.319 align:start position:0%
Market Basket is a little different
 
02:53:35.790 --> 02:53:35.800 align:start position:0%
because they're self-insured but if it
 
02:53:38.309 --> 02:53:38.319 align:start position:0%
was like Haniford they are in they have
 
02:53:40.429 --> 02:53:40.439 align:start position:0%
outside insurance and so what happens
 
02:53:43.190 --> 02:53:43.200 align:start position:0%
exactly the outside Insurance steps into
 
02:53:46.790 --> 02:53:46.800 align:start position:0%
the shoes of the defendant and makes all
 
02:53:48.870 --> 02:53:48.880 align:start position:0%
the controlling decisions in defending
 
02:53:50.790 --> 02:53:50.800 align:start position:0%
the case because of an Indemnity
 
02:53:52.550 --> 02:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
agreement that's part of the insurance
 
02:53:53.750 --> 02:53:53.760 align:start position:0%
so what I'm saying no no that has
 
02:53:55.269 --> 02:53:55.279 align:start position:0%
nothing to do with this no no but what
 
02:53:57.590 --> 02:53:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'm saying is if there is if this is
 
02:54:00.110 --> 02:54:00.120 align:start position:0%
truly about third-party funding and
 
02:54:02.469 --> 02:54:02.479 align:start position:0%
litigation then the defendants
 
02:54:04.670 --> 02:54:04.680 align:start position:0%
thirdparty funding should also be
 
02:54:07.429 --> 02:54:07.439 align:start position:0%
required to make similar
 
02:54:09.830 --> 02:54:09.840 align:start position:0%
disclosures they already do so under
 
02:54:12.349 --> 02:54:12.359 align:start position:0%
Court rule 22 they do not they do not
 
02:54:14.830 --> 02:54:14.840 align:start position:0%
have to disclose their Reserve amount
 
02:54:16.070 --> 02:54:16.080 align:start position:0%
they do not have to disclose their
 
02:54:17.830 --> 02:54:17.840 align:start position:0%
litigation budget they do not have to
 
02:54:20.030 --> 02:54:20.040 align:start position:0%
disclose the hourly rate for defense
 
02:54:23.349 --> 02:54:23.359 align:start position:0%
cwhere I did all right we'll just put
 
02:54:25.030 --> 02:54:25.040 align:start position:0%
all right we'll put
 
02:54:28.030 --> 02:54:28.040 align:start position:0%
that right now yeah how do you guys you
 
02:54:29.550 --> 02:54:29.560 align:start position:0%
obviously feel different about this
 
02:54:31.590 --> 02:54:31.600 align:start position:0%
right no we feel the same and we just no
 
02:54:33.870 --> 02:54:33.880 align:start position:0%

02:54:35.950 --> 02:54:35.960 align:start position:0%
different from Tony I it just feels like
 
02:54:35.960 --> 02:54:37.269 align:start position:0%
different from Tony I it just feels like
we're

02:54:37.269 --> 02:54:37.279 align:start position:0%
we're
 
02:54:40.429 --> 02:54:40.439 align:start position:0%
we're the issue here was not about
 
02:54:43.630 --> 02:54:43.640 align:start position:0%
insurance companies the issue was about
 
02:54:45.710 --> 02:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
someone who was
 
02:54:48.790 --> 02:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
financing the settlement
 
02:54:50.830 --> 02:54:50.840 align:start position:0%
okay but that's not what the the title
 
02:54:53.269 --> 02:54:53.279 align:start position:0%
of the bill is the title of the bill is
 
02:54:54.990 --> 02:54:55.000 align:start position:0%
litigation funding
 
02:54:55.000 --> 02:54:56.710 align:start position:0%
litigation funding
transparency

02:54:56.710 --> 02:54:56.720 align:start position:0%
transparency
 
02:55:00.269 --> 02:55:00.279 align:start position:0%
correct litigation funding and insurance
 
02:55:02.110 --> 02:55:02.120 align:start position:0%
companies are funding the
 
02:55:07.150 --> 02:55:07.160 align:start position:0%
defense how about uh third party um
 
02:55:07.160 --> 02:55:09.790 align:start position:0%
defense how about uh third party um
settlement

02:55:09.790 --> 02:55:09.800 align:start position:0%
settlement
 
02:55:12.710 --> 02:55:12.720 align:start position:0%
funding you know I'm fine but you know
 
02:55:14.950 --> 02:55:14.960 align:start position:0%
and what I'll tell you what I feel like
 
02:55:17.309 --> 02:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
we're we're we're it's good to get rid
 
02:55:20.510 --> 02:55:20.520 align:start position:0%
of that Pro rition thing this issue here
 
02:55:22.550 --> 02:55:22.560 align:start position:0%
take it up with the Senate sure take it
 
02:55:24.389 --> 02:55:24.399 align:start position:0%
up with the Senate but I no I don't
 
02:55:26.150 --> 02:55:26.160 align:start position:0%
think we need to get into that because
 
02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
we're not that's not what this was Bill
 
02:55:29.790 --> 02:55:29.800 align:start position:0%
about this bill is not about you know
 
02:55:32.150 --> 02:55:32.160 align:start position:0%
that the fact that that Market Basket
 
02:55:35.229 --> 02:55:35.239 align:start position:0%
said okay you insurance company if this
 
02:55:37.790 --> 02:55:37.800 align:start position:0%
is your case now you're walking away
 
02:55:40.990 --> 02:55:41.000 align:start position:0%
from it no no that's that's not I don't
 
02:55:41.000 --> 02:55:42.349 align:start position:0%
from it no no that's that's not I don't
see

02:55:42.349 --> 02:55:42.359 align:start position:0%
see
 
02:55:44.510 --> 02:55:44.520 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't make sense it doesn't
 
02:55:45.990 --> 02:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
make sense to participate this think
 
02:55:49.150 --> 02:55:49.160 align:start position:0%
about it and that is okay it if I'm in a
 
02:55:53.190 --> 02:55:53.200 align:start position:0%
car accident okay and and whether I'm at
 
02:55:56.550 --> 02:55:56.560 align:start position:0%
fault you know in terms of yes my
 
02:56:01.389 --> 02:56:01.399 align:start position:0%
my it's a big lawsuit around it okay um
 
02:56:04.150 --> 02:56:04.160 align:start position:0%
so I you know I have um uh you know I
 
02:56:08.590 --> 02:56:08.600 align:start position:0%
have maximum coverages okay and I have a
 
02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:09.429 align:start position:0%
have maximum coverages okay and I have a
an

02:56:09.429 --> 02:56:09.439 align:start position:0%
an
 
02:56:12.110 --> 02:56:12.120 align:start position:0%
umbrella right so what I'm saying is
 
02:56:15.150 --> 02:56:15.160 align:start position:0%
that yes but at that point my umbrella
 
02:56:17.670 --> 02:56:17.680 align:start position:0%
is running the case because they're
 
02:56:18.750 --> 02:56:18.760 align:start position:0%
defending me
 
02:56:19.790 --> 02:56:19.800 align:start position:0%
all right they're the ones who don't
 
02:56:22.150 --> 02:56:22.160 align:start position:0%
want to make a big settlement so what
 
02:56:25.110 --> 02:56:25.120 align:start position:0%
what disclosure do I have to do I need
 
02:56:27.150 --> 02:56:27.160 align:start position:0%
to I think we had this was like the bill
 
02:56:29.229 --> 02:56:29.239 align:start position:0%
we had last year where was he were
 
02:56:32.389 --> 02:56:32.399 align:start position:0%
supposed to disclose exactly so that at
 
02:56:36.269 --> 02:56:36.279 align:start position:0%
this point I I do say um I understand
 
02:56:38.030 --> 02:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
where you're now coming from and no I
 
02:56:40.950 --> 02:56:40.960 align:start position:0%
don't agree I think I voted the the
 
02:56:43.429 --> 02:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
wrong way on that issue for you okay so
 
02:56:45.590 --> 02:56:45.600 align:start position:0%
at this point I I think I think that's
 
02:56:47.309 --> 02:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
not necessary I really don't that's not
 
02:56:49.229 --> 02:56:49.239 align:start position:0%
what this I I understand that you think
 
02:56:51.309 --> 02:56:51.319 align:start position:0%
it should be a fair and equal thing I'm
 
02:56:53.110 --> 02:56:53.120 align:start position:0%
always in favor of fair and equal we're
 
02:56:55.590 --> 02:56:55.600 align:start position:0%
not that's different right just like we
 
02:56:58.190 --> 02:56:58.200 align:start position:0%
change the title no I
 
02:57:00.750 --> 02:57:00.760 align:start position:0%
don't we don't need to change the text
 
02:57:02.750 --> 02:57:02.760 align:start position:0%
okay we're gonna just at this point I'm
 
02:57:05.110 --> 02:57:05.120 align:start position:0%
R is there anything else we need to
 
02:57:07.150 --> 02:57:07.160 align:start position:0%
anything else other than that I think
 
02:57:10.910 --> 02:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
we're you you beat this horse beat this
 
02:57:10.920 --> 02:57:12.630 align:start position:0%
we're you you beat this horse beat this
horse

02:57:12.630 --> 02:57:12.640 align:start position:0%
horse
 
02:57:16.950 --> 02:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
Okay okay so now we want to talk to the
 
02:57:17.990 --> 02:57:18.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because we want to see
 
02:57:18.000 --> 02:57:18.670 align:start position:0%
subcommittee because we want to see
whether

02:57:18.670 --> 02:57:18.680 align:start position:0%
whether
 
02:57:20.630 --> 02:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
La okay
 
02:57:23.269 --> 02:57:23.279 align:start position:0%
lawyers go back to your corner go back
 
02:57:25.349 --> 02:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
to your corner now you're the lawyer
 
02:57:30.950 --> 02:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:57:33.550 --> 02:57:33.560 align:start position:0%
say and
 
02:57:38.229 --> 02:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
right you don't have standing when it
 
02:57:42.190 --> 02:57:42.200 align:start position:0%
come okay is it more about Investors out
 
02:57:44.710 --> 02:57:44.720 align:start position:0%
their investors pitching in so the
 
02:57:47.830 --> 02:57:47.840 align:start position:0%
investor dependent yeah they're pitching
 
02:57:49.670 --> 02:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
in but that what the whole issue with
 
02:57:51.710 --> 02:57:51.720 align:start position:0%
that what that was going on was is how
 
02:57:54.190 --> 02:57:54.200 align:start position:0%
much of a role because you are investing
 
02:57:57.349 --> 02:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
it how much is a role you have and how
 
02:58:00.110 --> 02:58:00.120 align:start position:0%
the case is being run and operated and
 
02:58:02.309 --> 02:58:02.319 align:start position:0%
you know and to me they're the devil
 
02:58:03.550 --> 02:58:03.560 align:start position:0%
okay this you know the idea that you're
 
02:58:06.110 --> 02:58:06.120 align:start position:0%
going to go out and have somebody pay
 
02:58:08.190 --> 02:58:08.200 align:start position:0%
you know give you money up front you
 
02:58:09.830 --> 02:58:09.840 align:start position:0%
know based on the case it's it's a
 
02:58:12.550 --> 02:58:12.560 align:start position:0%
little I think sideline but I think the
 
02:58:14.550 --> 02:58:14.560 align:start position:0%
it's that's we you know predatory you
 
02:58:16.269 --> 02:58:16.279 align:start position:0%
know it's predatory it's it's icky you
 
02:58:18.870 --> 02:58:18.880 align:start position:0%
see cases are very good example that's a
 
02:58:20.870 --> 02:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
lot of money involved that's a lot right
 
02:58:22.269 --> 02:58:22.279 align:start position:0%
well and the fact that they're slammed
 
02:58:24.590 --> 02:58:24.600 align:start position:0%
on slammed on cases but didn't they lose
 
02:58:28.190 --> 02:58:28.200 align:start position:0%
one of the cases just the the the uh
 
02:58:31.790 --> 02:58:31.800 align:start position:0%
State one I guess but okay so I just
 
02:58:34.910 --> 02:58:34.920 align:start position:0%
want is everybody comfortable okay so if
 
02:58:36.830 --> 02:58:36.840 align:start position:0%
every that's when it begin right now
 
02:58:39.830 --> 02:58:39.840 align:start position:0%
where I think I am and I think we are is
 
02:58:42.429 --> 02:58:42.439 align:start position:0%
just removing uh
 
02:58:42.439 --> 02:58:44.030 align:start position:0%
just removing uh
294

02:58:44.030 --> 02:58:44.040 align:start position:0%
294
 
02:58:46.870 --> 02:58:46.880 align:start position:0%
df3 prohibitions related to commercial
 
02:58:49.309 --> 02:58:49.319 align:start position:0%
litigation funding so we're just moving
 
02:58:51.190 --> 02:58:51.200 align:start position:0%
that section of the
 
02:58:51.200 --> 02:58:55.670 align:start position:0%
that section of the
bill

02:58:55.670 --> 02:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:58:55.680 --> 02:58:57.309 align:start position:0%
 
removing

02:58:57.309 --> 02:58:57.319 align:start position:0%
removing
 
02:58:59.950 --> 02:58:59.960 align:start position:0%
F4 F4 I I don't think we need to mess
 
02:59:02.389 --> 02:59:02.399 align:start position:0%
around with F4 it's
 
02:59:04.630 --> 02:59:04.640 align:start position:0%
fine it's just
 
02:59:07.389 --> 02:59:07.399 align:start position:0%
F3 so basically you're allowing you're
 
02:59:09.870 --> 02:59:09.880 align:start position:0%
allowing a third party Financial or
 
02:59:11.950 --> 02:59:11.960 align:start position:0%
outside investor to pitch in the money
 
02:59:14.150 --> 02:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
to run the cas at this point we're not
 
02:59:17.110 --> 02:59:17.120 align:start position:0%
getting into what's the nature of that
 
02:59:18.790 --> 02:59:18.800 align:start position:0%
relationship or they're doing in the
 
02:59:21.229 --> 02:59:21.239 align:start position:0%
case or how they mck M things around
 
02:59:23.790 --> 02:59:23.800 align:start position:0%
what we're just trying to do is get
 
02:59:25.750 --> 02:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
everybody aware that it's it exists
 
02:59:27.950 --> 02:59:27.960 align:start position:0%
we're not saying you can't do it we just
 
02:59:29.710 --> 02:59:29.720 align:start position:0%
want to know that you're doing it and
 
02:59:31.670 --> 02:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
and and as the the lawyer was pointing
 
02:59:33.750 --> 02:59:33.760 align:start position:0%
out that most of these things actually
 
02:59:36.590 --> 02:59:36.600 align:start position:0%
there is case law that you can't do it
 
02:59:41.469 --> 02:59:41.479 align:start position:0%
and they're rules okay so they're legal
 
02:59:46.870 --> 02:59:46.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:50.750 --> 02:59:50.760 align:start position:0%
rules okay okay so at this point um uh
 
02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:53.359 align:start position:0%
we we can I mean technically we don't
 
02:59:56.070 --> 02:59:56.080 align:start position:0%
have a correct Amendment so normally I
 
02:59:57.670 --> 02:59:57.680 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have his vote but so I would
 
03:00:00.229 --> 03:00:00.239 align:start position:0%
say is a straw vote are we are we the
 
03:00:02.910 --> 03:00:02.920 align:start position:0%
straw vote are we um okay with this
 
03:00:02.920 --> 03:00:04.150 align:start position:0%
straw vote are we um okay with this
amendment

03:00:04.150 --> 03:00:04.160 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:00:10.349 --> 03:00:10.359 align:start position:0%
0631 um less uh par section 294
 
03:00:10.359 --> 03:00:12.229 align:start position:0%
0631 um less uh par section 294
F3

03:00:12.229 --> 03:00:12.239 align:start position:0%
F3
 
03:00:21.790 --> 03:00:21.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:23.990 --> 03:00:24.000 align:start position:0%
it it's a Nuance that he was trying to
 
03:00:26.910 --> 03:00:26.920 align:start position:0%
get into in terms of the of the lawyer
 
03:00:29.550 --> 03:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
you about if the insurance company okay
 
03:00:31.429 --> 03:00:31.439 align:start position:0%
because remember what's driving this
 
03:00:33.950 --> 03:00:33.960 align:start position:0%
legislation is insurance companies are
 
03:00:36.670 --> 03:00:36.680 align:start position:0%
are pointing out that they they play an
 
03:00:40.030 --> 03:00:40.040 align:start position:0%
important role in settlements and so yes
 
03:00:42.870 --> 03:00:42.880 align:start position:0%
we respect his opinion that that he's
 
03:00:44.750 --> 03:00:44.760 align:start position:0%
know because that's who's usually on the
 
03:00:46.750 --> 03:00:46.760 align:start position:0%
other side of cases that they're dealing
 
03:00:49.429 --> 03:00:49.439 align:start position:0%
with but that's not what this legis you
 
03:00:51.710 --> 03:00:51.720 align:start position:0%
know he can he has a great argument to
 
03:00:53.590 --> 03:00:53.600 align:start position:0%
go to the Senate and say this is not
 
03:00:57.469 --> 03:00:57.479 align:start position:0%
fair it's unequal but at the same time I
 
03:01:00.309 --> 03:01:00.319 align:start position:0%
would say is all we did is is had put
 
03:01:02.269 --> 03:01:02.279 align:start position:0%
something in that is disclosing that
 
03:01:07.429 --> 03:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
everybody now knows it that that
 
03:01:07.439 --> 03:01:10.070 align:start position:0%
everybody now knows it that that
exists

03:01:10.070 --> 03:01:10.080 align:start position:0%
exists
 
03:01:12.269 --> 03:01:12.279 align:start position:0%
okay you all right with
 
03:01:16.190 --> 03:01:16.200 align:start position:0%
that okay so the straw booat is um uh
 
03:01:20.389 --> 03:01:20.399 align:start position:0%
accept this amendment 63 G1 uh less uh
 
03:01:24.389 --> 03:01:24.399 align:start position:0%
section F3 and that just so for minua
 
03:01:26.910 --> 03:01:26.920 align:start position:0%
that when you see this bill tomorrow it
 
03:01:29.150 --> 03:01:29.160 align:start position:0%
just it all the things will get after
 
03:01:31.469 --> 03:01:31.479 align:start position:0%
then so in other words the F4 will now
 
03:01:34.429 --> 03:01:34.439 align:start position:0%
become F3 they just they just move
 
03:01:37.990 --> 03:01:38.000 align:start position:0%
