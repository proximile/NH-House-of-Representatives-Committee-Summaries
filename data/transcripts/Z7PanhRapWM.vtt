but I can do that once I do that I hand
 
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 align:start position:0%

house but it can only be presented in an
 
00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
exact session by one of us so if you

know we've heard a bill and somebody
 
00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 align:start position:0%

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 align:start position:0%
if we do this I'm going to get an
 
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 align:start position:0%
amendment that's all well and good but
 
00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 align:start position:0%
one of us has to be the one to introduce
 
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 align:start position:0%
it from Anne Fitzgerald who is uh the
 
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
boss on the fourth floor She says after
 
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 align:start position:0%

bottles notice she didn't say coffee
 
00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
cups because we don't have coffee here
 
00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 align:start position:0%

five of us could get here and so we uh
 
00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 align:start position:0%
decided all that nice paper shouldn't go
 
00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 align:start position:0%
to waste and uh we put some of the items
 
00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 align:start position:0%

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
caucus a little bit about
 
00:05:56.029 --> 00:05:56.039 align:start position:0%
February um I'm going to skip a few
 
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.160 align:start position:0%
weeks and go with the 15th that's a
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
thirs Thursday we start at 1 p.m. the
 
00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:05.000 align:start position:0%
governor's State of the State address uh
 
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 align:start position:0%
and then after that we have a voting
 
00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
session we may want a committee meeting
 
00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.870 align:start position:0%
session we may want a committee meeting
that

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:13.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
morning and you've already been you know
 
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:21.160 align:start position:0%
asked to hold all Thursdays in February
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
so we may meet in the morning because
 
00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 align:start position:0%
that way we may not have to have an
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
other day when you wouldn't normally
 
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:31.880 align:start position:0%
have been here so hold the entire
 
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:36.440 align:start position:0%
15th on the 22nd we will probably go
 
00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 align:start position:0%
late this is one of those rare
 
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 align:start position:0%
occurrences where there are five
 
00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 align:start position:0%
Thursdays in February it's a leap year
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
and that's school vacation so we won't
 
00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 align:start position:0%
be meeting any any little procedural
 
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
questions you may have from
 
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:57.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 align:start position:0%
you I open the hearing on House Bill
 
00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 align:start position:0%
1392 relative to consideration of the
 
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:07.000 align:start position:0%
opinion of the child in determining
 
00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:10.759 align:start position:0%
parenting time F flown in at Great
 
00:07:13.469 --> 00:07:13.479 align:start position:0%
expense is our very own representative
 
00:07:13.479 --> 00:07:14.710 align:start position:0%
expense is our very own representative
Gibbons

00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:14.720 align:start position:0%
Gibbons
 
00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:19.560 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you Mr chairman um so I'm
 
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.120 align:start position:0%
the only sponsor on this uh bill just
 
00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:25.440 align:start position:0%
because I did most of this work during
 
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:28.680 align:start position:0%
the summer um and I did a lot of
 
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.909 align:start position:0%
the summer um and I did a lot of
research

00:07:29.909 --> 00:07:29.919 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:33.400 align:start position:0%
about uh how to get the child heard in
 
00:07:36.029 --> 00:07:36.039 align:start position:0%
court uh the child has a right to be
 
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:40.840 align:start position:0%
heard um and the problem is though that
 
00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:43.080 align:start position:0%
bringing a child into court to give
 
00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479 align:start position:0%
their their own testimony can be
 
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 align:start position:0%
traumatic to the child um and this comes
 
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:50.080 align:start position:0%
from scientific
 
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:51.990 align:start position:0%
from scientific
research

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
research
 
00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:56.360 align:start position:0%
uh about about um what I was looking up
 
00:07:59.909 --> 00:07:59.919 align:start position:0%
with the the child giving uh
 
00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:01.840 align:start position:0%
their opinion about kind of anything
 
00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:05.000 align:start position:0%
going on with their family
 
00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:08.840 align:start position:0%
so um so New Hampshire law currently
 
00:08:11.469 --> 00:08:11.479 align:start position:0%
states that if the child is of
 
00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:15.080 align:start position:0%
sufficient maturity then they can give
 
00:08:18.909 --> 00:08:18.919 align:start position:0%
their opinion but how does one determine
 
00:08:21.629 --> 00:08:21.639 align:start position:0%
if the child is of sufficient maturity
 
00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:23.720 align:start position:0%
well the judge has to make that
 
00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:27.360 align:start position:0%
determination and so then it turns out
 
00:08:29.469 --> 00:08:29.479 align:start position:0%
that the judges generally AR aren't
 
00:08:32.509 --> 00:08:32.519 align:start position:0%
making those determinations because to
 
00:08:36.029 --> 00:08:36.039 align:start position:0%
bring them in to the court to make that
 
00:08:39.310 --> 00:08:39.320 align:start position:0%
determination is potentially traumatic
 
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
if they find that the child is not
 
00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:44.680 align:start position:0%
mature enough to give their opinion so
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
they caused trauma without hearing the
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
child's opinion and
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
so they just kind of the the courts
 
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
generally just stay away from from that
 
00:08:58.470 --> 00:08:58.480 align:start position:0%
alog together so I was like well how do
 
00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
we solve this
 
00:09:03.430 --> 00:09:03.440 align:start position:0%
so basically I wanted to get an outside
 
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
opinion of the child to come to the
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
court to to heal that amends that that
 
00:09:14.509 --> 00:09:14.519 align:start position:0%
that break there um so if the child has
 
00:09:17.389 --> 00:09:17.399 align:start position:0%
a therapist someone that knows the child
 
00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:21.200 align:start position:0%
well um at a at a pretty deep level uh
 
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:24.920 align:start position:0%
then they can offer and just a oneliner
 
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
you know that this child is mature
 
00:09:28.110 --> 00:09:28.120 align:start position:0%
enough to give their opinion in court
 
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:30.680 align:start position:0%
like simple and I thought that that was
 
00:09:32.470 --> 00:09:32.480 align:start position:0%
I thought that that was great and and I
 
00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
got some good feedback that well we
 
00:09:39.829 --> 00:09:39.839 align:start position:0%
don't want to put the child into a
 
00:09:42.350 --> 00:09:42.360 align:start position:0%
situation where they're
 
00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:45.440 align:start position:0%
testifying against the parents and it's
 
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:48.320 align:start position:0%
like well that's really true so I agree
 
00:09:52.389 --> 00:09:52.399 align:start position:0%
with that um so I was given some
 
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.760 align:start position:0%
feedback that maybe the child should
 
00:09:59.870 --> 00:09:59.880 align:start position:0%
uh give their opinion to the judge in
 
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:02.160 align:start position:0%
Chambers um so that the parents can't
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
hear so that the child is not testifying
 
00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:06.640 align:start position:0%
against one parent or the other I
 
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680 align:start position:0%
thought that was a great idea so I so I
 
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:11.480 align:start position:0%
asked OSS to make an
 
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
amendment and and they they put it
 
00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:19.600 align:start position:0%
together for me um but then uh our good
 
00:10:23.269 --> 00:10:23.279 align:start position:0%
chairman uh Mark Peterson uh got me in
 
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:28.360 align:start position:0%
touch with uh her first name is Aaron
 
00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.600 align:start position:0%
she is a
 
00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
lawyer who is like an in between uh
 
00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:36.800 align:start position:0%
between the judges and the legislature
 
00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:39.760 align:start position:0%
and she and I had a phone call that this
 
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:42.600 align:start position:0%
is addressing an issue that they see
 
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
frequently in the courts and it's an
 
00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:49.800 align:start position:0%
important issue to address however um if
 
00:10:52.590 --> 00:10:52.600 align:start position:0%
the child gives their opinion to the
 
00:10:54.829 --> 00:10:54.839 align:start position:0%
judge in Chambers then it creates an
 
00:11:00.310 --> 00:11:00.320 align:start position:0%
appet issue because uh the party the the
 
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
divorcing parents or or the single
 
00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.790 align:start position:0%
divorcing parents or or the single
parents

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:05.800 align:start position:0%
parents
 
00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
um then don't have access to all the
 
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:11.120 align:start position:0%
testimony and that's an impellent
 
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:16.560 align:start position:0%
issue so at this time I am waiting for
 
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:19.320 align:start position:0%
she is going Aaron is going to contact
 
00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:24.320 align:start position:0%
the judges to get their opinions to find
 
00:11:27.829 --> 00:11:27.839 align:start position:0%
out what is the best way to address this
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
issue she's going to circle back with me
 
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.240 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to ask OS to write another
 
00:11:39.470 --> 00:11:39.480 align:start position:0%
amendment um and then I will submit that
 
00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:43.120 align:start position:0%
to this committee um so I'm happy to
 
00:11:44.710 --> 00:11:44.720 align:start position:0%
take your
 
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:49.440 align:start position:0%
questions also just as a as a reminder I
 
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:51.760 align:start position:0%
am on board with the parents having
 
00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:55.200 align:start position:0%
equal parenting time so when I'm when
 
00:11:57.030 --> 00:11:57.040 align:start position:0%
I'm wanting the child to be able to
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
State their opinion because they have
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
the right to be
 
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:03.720 align:start position:0%
heard I'm not asking for the child to
 
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
pick one parent or the other um I'm I'm
 
00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:11.360 align:start position:0%
of the mindset that the child wants to
 
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:14.480 align:start position:0%
spend equal time with both parents and
 
00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:16.320 align:start position:0%
this might be a situation where the
 
00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
child wants to spend
 
00:12:22.949 --> 00:12:22.959 align:start position:0%
Friday with the
 
00:12:27.069 --> 00:12:27.079 align:start position:0%
dad because their friend next door is
 
00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:28.680 align:start position:0%
having a sleepover party something like
 
00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:32.399 align:start position:0%
that you know something really benign um
 
00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:34.680 align:start position:0%
maybe the the child wants to spend
 
00:12:38.269 --> 00:12:38.279 align:start position:0%
Tuesdays with parent a and Thursdays
 
00:12:40.710 --> 00:12:40.720 align:start position:0%
with parent B you know something like
 
00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:43.839 align:start position:0%
that um it it's very frequently that
 
00:12:45.269 --> 00:12:45.279 align:start position:0%
they'll do every other weekend so we
 
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:48.440 align:start position:0%
don't really need to parse that out um
 
00:12:52.189 --> 00:12:52.199 align:start position:0%
but their opinion about what the 50%
 
00:12:57.829 --> 00:12:57.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.839 --> 00:12:59.590 align:start position:0%
 
after

00:12:59.590 --> 00:12:59.600 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:07.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you chairman uh for letting
 
00:13:14.189 --> 00:13:14.199 align:start position:0%
me ask this question and thank you uh
 
00:13:17.990 --> 00:13:18.000 align:start position:0%
for letting me ask this question is this
 
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:21.480 align:start position:0%
already in place with the guiding at
 
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:24.760 align:start position:0%
lams so that's in very interesting that
 
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
you brought that up um that came up in
 
00:13:29.870 --> 00:13:29.880 align:start position:0%
my conversation with Aaron
 
00:13:33.710 --> 00:13:33.720 align:start position:0%
and and I asked about that you know who
 
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:35.800 align:start position:0%
and she she mentioned that Guardian at
 
00:13:39.629 --> 00:13:39.639 align:start position:0%
lims tend to be the in between however
 
00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:42.480 align:start position:0%
they are not funded by the state and so
 
00:13:44.509 --> 00:13:44.519 align:start position:0%
they are not accessible to people that
 
00:13:47.550 --> 00:13:47.560 align:start position:0%
can't pay for them so there's a
 
00:13:50.269 --> 00:13:50.279 align:start position:0%
significant number of families that
 
00:13:52.949 --> 00:13:52.959 align:start position:0%
don't have Financial access to have a
 
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
guardian at lium and that's where this
 
00:13:57.749 --> 00:13:57.759 align:start position:0%
becomes an
 
00:14:01.990 --> 00:14:02.000 align:start position:0%
issue thank anyone else representative
 
00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
00:14:09.189 --> 00:14:09.199 align:start position:0%
you for taking my call um should the um
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
should it be determined that a therapist
 
00:14:15.749 --> 00:14:15.759 align:start position:0%
is necessary and um there's to determine
 
00:14:18.189 --> 00:14:18.199 align:start position:0%
whether the child is of a m level of
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
maturity to um testify um if the child
 
00:14:24.430 --> 00:14:24.440 align:start position:0%
does not has not had a Therapist
 
00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:27.720 align:start position:0%
assigned and the parents are do not do
 
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
not have find
 
00:14:32.189 --> 00:14:32.199 align:start position:0%
Financial Resources to afford a
 
00:14:34.189 --> 00:14:34.199 align:start position:0%
therapist um how would that situation be
 
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:36.720 align:start position:0%
handled according to your bill yes thank
 
00:14:39.790 --> 00:14:39.800 align:start position:0%
you for that question um that was in the
 
00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:42.000 align:start position:0%
OS amendment that I'm not presenting
 
00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:45.920 align:start position:0%
right now um and it's the the answer is
 
00:14:49.470 --> 00:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
that a school therapist could could also
 
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
uh do that assessment um and that might
 
00:14:57.389 --> 00:14:57.399 align:start position:0%
end up in my second amendment um cuz my
 
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:00.600 align:start position:0%
second amendment will be depend on what
 
00:15:03.790 --> 00:15:03.800 align:start position:0%
the on what feedback I get about from
 
00:15:06.550 --> 00:15:06.560 align:start position:0%
the judges on So if they still want an
 
00:15:11.389 --> 00:15:11.399 align:start position:0%
outside source of assessment um then
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
I'll keep the school counselor part in
 
00:15:19.870 --> 00:15:19.880 align:start position:0%
there um so yes it is the the issue is
 
00:15:21.949 --> 00:15:21.959 align:start position:0%
addressed I'm just not presenting it
 
00:15:23.269 --> 00:15:23.279 align:start position:0%
right now because we're going to be
 
00:15:24.749 --> 00:15:24.759 align:start position:0%
doing a second amendment so there's no
 
00:15:26.470 --> 00:15:26.480 align:start position:0%
need to give the First
 
00:15:29.949 --> 00:15:29.959 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative sidel
 
00:15:31.189 --> 00:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in your bill it
 
00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:35.720 align:start position:0%
spec it doesn't specify a type of
 
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:38.120 align:start position:0%
therapist there's like 18 different
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
types of therapists is it any type or
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
specific um I wasn't specific about it
 
00:15:46.629 --> 00:15:46.639 align:start position:0%
um the goal was just to have a
 
00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:50.360 align:start position:0%
professional who knows the child well to
 
00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:52.079 align:start position:0%
because all they're doing is they're not
 
00:15:54.470 --> 00:15:54.480 align:start position:0%
doing like a like a deep psychological
 
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
assessment they're just saying if the
 
00:15:57.670 --> 00:15:57.680 align:start position:0%
child is mature enough to be able to
 
00:15:59.670 --> 00:15:59.680 align:start position:0%
give their opinion in court court so
 
00:16:02.389 --> 00:16:02.399 align:start position:0%
that going to court actually provides a
 
00:16:05.590 --> 00:16:05.600 align:start position:0%
benefit and not any type of negative for
 
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:08.120 align:start position:0%
the child
 
00:16:11.309 --> 00:16:11.319 align:start position:0%
so representative
 
00:16:13.710 --> 00:16:13.720 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman Pearson thank
 
00:16:17.030 --> 00:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um if you could
 
00:16:20.069 --> 00:16:20.079 align:start position:0%
just clarify for me it already says if
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
it finds clear and convincing evidence
 
00:16:24.269 --> 00:16:24.279 align:start position:0%
and it also says if there are other
 
00:16:26.189 --> 00:16:26.199 align:start position:0%
factors so I'm wondering why the
 
00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:28.600 align:start position:0%
therapist reports are input from these
 
00:16:31.389 --> 00:16:31.399 align:start position:0%
other professionals wouldn't be already
 
00:16:34.269 --> 00:16:34.279 align:start position:0%
submitted as part of the evidence or as
 
00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:36.629 align:start position:0%
submitted as part of the evidence or as
another

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:36.639 align:start position:0%
another
 
00:16:38.949 --> 00:16:38.959 align:start position:0%
Factor where what line are you looking
 
00:16:41.430 --> 00:16:41.440 align:start position:0%
at I'm looking at line
 
00:16:44.829 --> 00:16:44.839 align:start position:0%
14 and let say it says it up on the top
 
00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:47.240 align:start position:0%
too right because it says if they're of
 
00:16:49.829 --> 00:16:49.839 align:start position:0%
sufficient maturity but the issue is how
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
to determine if they're of sufficient
 
00:16:56.269 --> 00:16:56.279 align:start position:0%
maturity and the issue at hand was
 
00:16:58.990 --> 00:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:17:02.749 --> 00:17:02.759 align:start position:0%
it given given no data then the judge
 
00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:05.079 align:start position:0%
would have to make that assessment and
 
00:17:07.309 --> 00:17:07.319 align:start position:0%
they generally weren't doing that
 
00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
because it would bring trauma to the
 
00:17:11.549 --> 00:17:11.559 align:start position:0%
child to bring them in court especially
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
if it's determined that they're that
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
they're not of sufficient
 
00:17:18.150 --> 00:17:18.160 align:start position:0%
maturity so they wanted like not
 
00:17:20.949 --> 00:17:20.959 align:start position:0%
traumatize the child followup thank you
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson so I'm still a little
 
00:17:25.590 --> 00:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
confused because then what is the when
 
00:17:27.630 --> 00:17:27.640 align:start position:0%
they're determining if the child is of
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
sufficient matur and they have to have
 
00:17:31.310 --> 00:17:31.320 align:start position:0%
clear and convincing evidence what is
 
00:17:32.669 --> 00:17:32.679 align:start position:0%
that evidence that they're using if
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
they're not using reports from the
 
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.160 align:start position:0%
school or input from it would generally
 
00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000 align:start position:0%
just be the judge's
 
00:17:41.029 --> 00:17:41.039 align:start position:0%
assessment of the
 
00:17:44.270 --> 00:17:44.280 align:start position:0%
child but but if they if we can get an
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
outside report then we take that burden
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
off of the
 
00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:51.160 align:start position:0%
judges to have to do that
 
00:17:54.430 --> 00:17:54.440 align:start position:0%
assessment um the chair um does that
 
00:17:56.630 --> 00:17:56.640 align:start position:0%
does that me did I answer your question
 
00:17:58.470 --> 00:17:58.480 align:start position:0%
representative Paul thank you you
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
chairman par I'm still a little bit I I
 
00:18:03.390 --> 00:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
I understand what you're saying I
 
00:18:05.350 --> 00:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
totally I get that that the judge talks
 
00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:08.280 align:start position:0%
to the child but he must have other
 
00:18:10.789 --> 00:18:10.799 align:start position:0%
evidence that's been presented in order
 
00:18:14.350 --> 00:18:14.360 align:start position:0%
for him to um for him to even come to an
 
00:18:17.190 --> 00:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
opinion or these or it says or other
 
00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:18.909 align:start position:0%
opinion or these or it says or other
factors

00:18:18.909 --> 00:18:18.919 align:start position:0%
factors
 
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
um the court shall also give due
 
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:23.080 align:start position:0%
consideration to other Factor so I'm
 
00:18:26.070 --> 00:18:26.080 align:start position:0%
just wondering why um written testimony
 
00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:27.880 align:start position:0%
or someone else coming in to testify
 
00:18:29.909 --> 00:18:29.919 align:start position:0%
wouldn't or a therapist wouldn't be
 
00:18:32.549 --> 00:18:32.559 align:start position:0%
qualified as other factors well because
 
00:18:36.549 --> 00:18:36.559 align:start position:0%
like the child's age is usually a factor
 
00:18:38.750 --> 00:18:38.760 align:start position:0%
like if they're you know 12 years old
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
and greater for example then they're
 
00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
generally considered mature enough um to
 
00:18:45.549 --> 00:18:45.559 align:start position:0%
give their opinion but when they're in
 
00:18:48.909 --> 00:18:48.919 align:start position:0%
that in between stage where they're not
 
00:18:51.470 --> 00:18:51.480 align:start position:0%
a young child clearly can't give their
 
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:54.120 align:start position:0%
opinion to court but it's that in
 
00:18:56.909 --> 00:18:56.919 align:start position:0%
between stage that pre-teenage and and a
 
00:18:59.149 --> 00:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
little bit younger where where their
 
00:19:00.950 --> 00:19:00.960 align:start position:0%
maturity might be in
 
00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:05.760 align:start position:0%
question um so I think I think by you're
 
00:19:08.070 --> 00:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
right it is vague and that's kind of my
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
point of why I wanted to clarify it is
 
00:19:13.950 --> 00:19:13.960 align:start position:0%
it your testimony that your conversation
 
00:19:17.710 --> 00:19:17.720 align:start position:0%
so far with people in Family Court are
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
is that um they
 
00:19:24.149 --> 00:19:24.159 align:start position:0%
don't know how to do this or they're not
 
00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:27.280 align:start position:0%
doing this which seems everything in law
 
00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:28.830 align:start position:0%
doing this which seems everything in law
notwithstanding

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
notwithstanding
 
00:19:32.110 --> 00:19:32.120 align:start position:0%
they need help correct yes and my
 
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:35.280 align:start position:0%
followup is that you went to the source
 
00:19:38.950 --> 00:19:38.960 align:start position:0%
and said judges how may we help you yes
 
00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:40.600 align:start position:0%
exactly and that's where we're that's
 
00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:42.760 align:start position:0%
where we're at a at a standstill right
 
00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
now because I'm waiting to get that
 
00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:47.799 align:start position:0%
feedback so so we've identified an issue
 
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:52.240 align:start position:0%
that does exist um where the the law is
 
00:19:55.870 --> 00:19:55.880 align:start position:0%
vague and needs Clarity and because the
 
00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:57.880 align:start position:0%
judges don't want to cause trauma to the
 
00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:58.950 align:start position:0%
judges don't want to cause trauma to the
child

00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
child
 
00:20:01.310 --> 00:20:01.320 align:start position:0%
without any type of benefit they
 
00:20:03.549 --> 00:20:03.559 align:start position:0%
generally don't bring the children in
 
00:20:05.950 --> 00:20:05.960 align:start position:0%
but then that but the child has a right
 
00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
to be heard so so we're trying to figure
 
00:20:10.669 --> 00:20:10.679 align:start position:0%
out a third way that'll work and you you
 
00:20:13.870 --> 00:20:13.880 align:start position:0%
brought the judges in on it exactly okay
 
00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
yes and and guardian at lims are
 
00:20:19.630 --> 00:20:19.640 align:start position:0%
generally the method that that is used
 
00:20:22.950 --> 00:20:22.960 align:start position:0%
but is not accessible to some families
 
00:20:26.710 --> 00:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
and your Amendment will deal with issues
 
00:20:30.029 --> 00:20:30.039 align:start position:0%
of bringing in a school coun or perhaps
 
00:20:33.669 --> 00:20:33.679 align:start position:0%
you're trying to give several options so
 
00:20:36.430 --> 00:20:36.440 align:start position:0%
that the judge may be uh more
 
00:20:38.190 --> 00:20:38.200 align:start position:0%
comfortable in rendering his or her
 
00:20:39.990 --> 00:20:40.000 align:start position:0%
opinion about the maturity is that that
 
00:20:41.870 --> 00:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
way you're going with this exactly okay
 
00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:43.520 align:start position:0%
because if the if it's determined that
 
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:45.600 align:start position:0%
the child is mature enough to give their
 
00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880 align:start position:0%
opinion about the situation because it's
 
00:20:50.270 --> 00:20:50.280 align:start position:0%
their it's their life you know if they
 
00:20:53.630 --> 00:20:53.640 align:start position:0%
want to spend time with you know the
 
00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:56.600 align:start position:0%
neighbor at Dad's house because they're
 
00:20:57.870 --> 00:20:57.880 align:start position:0%
having a birthday party because they
 
00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:00.240 align:start position:0%
have a pool in the summer you know then
 
00:21:02.430 --> 00:21:02.440 align:start position:0%
they can give that opinion and and the
 
00:21:05.070 --> 00:21:05.080 align:start position:0%
child can spend certain days over with
 
00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:08.120 align:start position:0%
Dad you know it's it's about how what
 
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:12.880 align:start position:0%
the 50% looks like sure not because I
 
00:21:15.430 --> 00:21:15.440 align:start position:0%
don't think that the child should be in
 
00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:16.919 align:start position:0%
a position where they determine
 
00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
parenting time um we have enough we have
 
00:21:23.390 --> 00:21:23.400 align:start position:0%
enough difficulty with that as it is
 
00:21:24.710 --> 00:21:24.720 align:start position:0%
anyway so we don't want to bring the
 
00:21:27.269 --> 00:21:27.279 align:start position:0%
child into that it's just what the 50%
 
00:21:29.269 --> 00:21:29.279 align:start position:0%
looks like does it look like this and
 
00:21:32.470 --> 00:21:32.480 align:start position:0%
then some weeks like that you know um
 
00:21:34.830 --> 00:21:34.840 align:start position:0%
okay any other
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
questions uh yes representative long had
 
00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:39.520 align:start position:0%
been next y thank you Mr chairman thank
 
00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:41.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um so this
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
assessment is this a written assessment
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
it in my mindset yes um but I'm still
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
waiting for feedback from the judges
 
00:21:54.710 --> 00:21:54.720 align:start position:0%
okay and uh follow up if I may follow up
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
um could I go to my first hearing and
 
00:21:59.269 --> 00:21:59.279 align:start position:0%
let the judge J know that I hired a
 
00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:02.480 align:start position:0%
therapist for the majority of my minor
 
00:22:05.310 --> 00:22:05.320 align:start position:0%
sure uh to give an assessment so that
 
00:22:07.669 --> 00:22:07.679 align:start position:0%
appointment's not till a couple months
 
00:22:10.549 --> 00:22:10.559 align:start position:0%
yeah sure okay yeah because we know that
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
these you know divorces and and whatnot
 
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:18.640 align:start position:0%
with with families takes a long time so
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
a few months is nothing in the grand
 
00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:22.600 align:start position:0%
scheme of things okay uh one more
 
00:22:24.750 --> 00:22:24.760 align:start position:0%
followup one more followup yeah the with
 
00:22:26.950 --> 00:22:26.960 align:start position:0%
respect to the
 
00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.149 align:start position:0%
respect to the
um

00:22:29.149 --> 00:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:38.310 --> 00:22:38.320 align:start position:0%
um termination of parental rights for
 
00:22:40.990 --> 00:22:41.000 align:start position:0%
example I want my I want my son to play
 
00:22:44.269 --> 00:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
football his mother does it ask the
 
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:46.520 align:start position:0%
child my son's mature wants to play
 
00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
football so he could say I'm I want to
 
00:22:51.190 --> 00:22:51.200 align:start position:0%
be with my dad Monday through Friday for
 
00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:52.470 align:start position:0%
be with my dad Monday through Friday for
football

00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:52.480 align:start position:0%
football
 
00:22:55.630 --> 00:22:55.640 align:start position:0%
practice so that that would be one of
 
00:22:58.549 --> 00:22:58.559 align:start position:0%
the determinations that the judge could
 
00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:01.440 align:start position:0%
make yeah if the child says that sure
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
okay great thank you my whole point is
 
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:07.120 align:start position:0%
that you know it's the child's life and
 
00:23:09.830 --> 00:23:09.840 align:start position:0%
so if the judge asks if it's if it's a
 
00:23:12.590 --> 00:23:12.600 align:start position:0%
situation where Monday through Friday
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
they want to be with the dad then I
 
00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:17.360 align:start position:0%
would expect the that the judge knowing
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
that there should be 50/50 ask the child
 
00:23:21.990 --> 00:23:22.000 align:start position:0%
well how do you want to spend what do
 
00:23:23.669 --> 00:23:23.679 align:start position:0%
you want the your time with your mom to
 
00:23:25.830 --> 00:23:25.840 align:start position:0%
look like and then get the child's
 
00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.510 --> 00:23:34.520 align:start position:0%
so the judge doesn't have to the judge
 
00:23:36.590 --> 00:23:36.600 align:start position:0%
does not have to order according to the
 
00:23:38.950 --> 00:23:38.960 align:start position:0%
child's opinion but I want the CH judge
 
00:23:41.830 --> 00:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
to hear the child's opinion because the
 
00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:44.240 align:start position:0%
child probably has reasons like like you
 
00:23:45.549 --> 00:23:45.559 align:start position:0%
were saying you know they're on the
 
00:23:46.909 --> 00:23:46.919 align:start position:0%
football team so they want to be at
 
00:23:49.789 --> 00:23:49.799 align:start position:0%
Dad's house or whatever um maybe it's a
 
00:23:51.710 --> 00:23:51.720 align:start position:0%
few hours with Dad and a few hours with
 
00:23:55.549 --> 00:23:55.559 align:start position:0%
Mom each day um but just get the child's
 
00:24:00.950 --> 00:24:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:03.230 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:24:03.230 --> 00:24:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
Raymond uh thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:24:07.549 --> 00:24:07.559 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question uh my
 
00:24:09.669 --> 00:24:09.679 align:start position:0%
question is a little bit different and
 
00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
in that do we know if there are
 
00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:14.960 align:start position:0%
therapists that do this and if it would
 
00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:17.720 align:start position:0%
be covered by medical insurance because
 
00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm thinking that the majority of
 
00:24:22.630 --> 00:24:22.640 align:start position:0%
parents don't have you know $250 an hour
 
00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:24.880 align:start position:0%
or more right to spend on a therapist to
 
00:24:27.110 --> 00:24:27.120 align:start position:0%
get to know their child to write a
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
report if like if this is a service that
 
00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:33.760 align:start position:0%
therapists provide um I did ask one
 
00:24:36.630 --> 00:24:36.640 align:start position:0%
therapist and they said that they
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
could so but I can't speak for all
 
00:24:43.269 --> 00:24:43.279 align:start position:0%
therapists um just based on what one
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
said to me but I would expect that they
 
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:48.200 align:start position:0%
would be able to write just a oneline
 
00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.549 align:start position:0%
would be able to write just a oneline
statement

00:24:49.549 --> 00:24:49.559 align:start position:0%
statement
 
00:24:53.149 --> 00:24:53.159 align:start position:0%
yeah and and like the amendment that I
 
00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:56.240 align:start position:0%
have that I have not presented says that
 
00:24:58.230 --> 00:24:58.240 align:start position:0%
a school counselor could if the family
 
00:25:00.630 --> 00:25:00.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a therapist so there
 
00:25:04.149 --> 00:25:04.159 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to be outof pocket
 
00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
costs representative Greg thank you Mr
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:25:10.870 --> 00:25:10.880 align:start position:0%
question and for presenting your bill
 
00:25:13.430 --> 00:25:13.440 align:start position:0%
today I'm wondering about maybe
 
00:25:16.070 --> 00:25:16.080 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences in this on one
 
00:25:18.350 --> 00:25:18.360 align:start position:0%
hand we're saying that we want the child
 
00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:21.600 align:start position:0%
to um be able to have a say but we're
 
00:25:23.909 --> 00:25:23.919 align:start position:0%
also saying well but they can't say like
 
00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:26.520 align:start position:0%
50/50 or whatever and that's your that's
 
00:25:27.950 --> 00:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
what you're saying right so you want
 
00:25:30.750 --> 00:25:30.760 align:start position:0%
them to have a partial say in their life
 
00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:35.720 align:start position:0%
well so I'm under the assumption because
 
00:25:37.710 --> 00:25:37.720 align:start position:0%
we we passed HB
 
00:25:41.110 --> 00:25:41.120 align:start position:0%
185 um and we have other bills that are
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
in the works for this year that about
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
equal parenting time so if the
 
00:25:48.669 --> 00:25:48.679 align:start position:0%
underlying assumption is equal parenting
 
00:25:51.310 --> 00:25:51.320 align:start position:0%
time then we're not determining
 
00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:53.120 align:start position:0%
parenting time we're just determining
 
00:25:56.789 --> 00:25:56.799 align:start position:0%
what the 50% looks like if it means a
 
00:25:59.389 --> 00:25:59.399 align:start position:0%
couple hours every day because they want
 
00:26:01.149 --> 00:26:01.159 align:start position:0%
to go to football practice and then they
 
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:05.960 align:start position:0%
want to have sleepover with Mom you know
 
00:26:08.630 --> 00:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
then that's what they want you know but
 
00:26:10.149 --> 00:26:10.159 align:start position:0%
the judge doesn't have to order
 
00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:13.960 align:start position:0%
according to the child's opinion if the
 
00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:15.760 align:start position:0%
if the judge
 
00:26:19.149 --> 00:26:19.159 align:start position:0%
disagrees um follow follow up go ahead
 
00:26:21.830 --> 00:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
all right so the next part I have is so
 
00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:25.960 align:start position:0%
even the most mature child can uh
 
00:26:27.710 --> 00:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
especially when parents have not gotten
 
00:26:29.870 --> 00:26:29.880 align:start position:0%
long and they can't come to an agreement
 
00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:33.640 align:start position:0%
can um turn the situation because that's
 
00:26:37.590 --> 00:26:37.600 align:start position:0%
their survival into a a bidding match as
 
00:26:39.510 --> 00:26:39.520 align:start position:0%
far as okay I'm going to I'm mad at my
 
00:26:41.789 --> 00:26:41.799 align:start position:0%
mom today and I'm going to teach her
 
00:26:44.990 --> 00:26:45.000 align:start position:0%
this L this um you know I'm going to say
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
I don't want to be with her on these
 
00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
days because I'm going to show her or
 
00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:49.720 align:start position:0%
maybe it's Dad they want to do that too
 
00:26:51.870 --> 00:26:51.880 align:start position:0%
what is this not adding more
 
00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
complications to the court system by
 
00:26:56.110 --> 00:26:56.120 align:start position:0%
letting a child who no matter how mature
 
00:26:58.710 --> 00:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
does not have the developmental skills
 
00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:01.600 align:start position:0%
to reason through certain things um this
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
much power or if they're not listened to
 
00:27:06.789 --> 00:27:06.799 align:start position:0%
this much disappointment like is this
 
00:27:09.430 --> 00:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
not just a huge complicating thing well
 
00:27:12.269 --> 00:27:12.279 align:start position:0%
and that's that's part of why I want was
 
00:27:14.029 --> 00:27:14.039 align:start position:0%
originally thinking that the child
 
00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:16.720 align:start position:0%
should should testify in Chambers but
 
00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
then I found out that that's an
 
00:27:20.070 --> 00:27:20.080 align:start position:0%
appellate issue so we're trying to
 
00:27:22.710 --> 00:27:22.720 align:start position:0%
figure out how to work that out so
 
00:27:24.389 --> 00:27:24.399 align:start position:0%
that's where the experts are going to
 
00:27:26.269 --> 00:27:26.279 align:start position:0%
come in and they're going to weigh in on
 
00:27:28.149 --> 00:27:28.159 align:start position:0%
it um
 
00:27:31.590 --> 00:27:31.600 align:start position:0%
and I did suggest to eron that maybe we
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
can just put in a line saying that the
 
00:27:35.870 --> 00:27:35.880 align:start position:0%
child's testimony does not create an
 
00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
appet issue
 
00:27:42.870 --> 00:27:42.880 align:start position:0%
um so because the the issue was that if
 
00:27:45.190 --> 00:27:45.200 align:start position:0%
the parents don't have access to all the
 
00:27:50.070 --> 00:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
testimony then that's cause for for
 
00:27:53.389 --> 00:27:53.399 align:start position:0%
appealing but if we just simply say
 
00:27:56.389 --> 00:27:56.399 align:start position:0%
that that the child's testimony in
 
00:27:58.149 --> 00:27:58.159 align:start position:0%
Chambers isn't
 
00:28:01.669 --> 00:28:01.679 align:start position:0%
isn't due cause for for appealing then
 
00:28:04.830 --> 00:28:04.840 align:start position:0%
that might be our solution so I'm I'm
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:10.789 --> 00:28:10.799 align:start position:0%
that would has it been so far your
 
00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
conclusion from speaking with people in
 
00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:18.039 align:start position:0%
family court that judges who have been
 
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
in family court for several months or
 
00:28:23.630 --> 00:28:23.640 align:start position:0%
longer can kind of figure out when one
 
00:28:26.269 --> 00:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
parent is playing off against the other
 
00:28:28.990 --> 00:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
or the child is trying to manipulate
 
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
that that this isn't their first rodeo
 
00:28:33.909 --> 00:28:33.919 align:start position:0%
on this hypothetical sure I would assume
 
00:28:35.710 --> 00:28:35.720 align:start position:0%
that yes I think that would be safe to
 
00:28:39.909 --> 00:28:39.919 align:start position:0%
assume um yeah I I will come back to
 
00:28:42.350 --> 00:28:42.360 align:start position:0%
this committee with with the expert
 
00:28:45.750 --> 00:28:45.760 align:start position:0%
opinions once I have them thank you so
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
much anything further I have no pink
 
00:28:50.590 --> 00:28:50.600 align:start position:0%
cards meaning no one has signed up to
 
00:28:53.950 --> 00:28:53.960 align:start position:0%
testify on this bill and if you wish to
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
testify on the other two bills we have
 
00:28:58.470 --> 00:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
this morning uh need to fill out pink
 
00:29:01.630 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
cards but thank you very much with that
 
00:29:04.669 --> 00:29:04.679 align:start position:0%
we conclude the hearing on this bill and
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
because there is an amendment coming we
 
00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:11.000 align:start position:0%
are not exing and we will be in uh
 
00:29:26.310 --> 00:29:26.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:37.470 align:start position:0%
 
minutes

00:29:37.470 --> 00:29:37.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.190 --> 00:29:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:53.990 align:start position:0%
 
building

00:29:53.990 --> 00:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:56.149 --> 00:29:56.159 align:start position:0%
yeah I have any trouble getting in this
 
00:30:26.230 --> 00:30:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:26.240 --> 00:34:45.389 align:start position:0%
 
that's

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:45.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:48.629 --> 00:34:48.639 align:start position:0%
open the hearing now on House Bill 1340
 
00:34:52.430 --> 00:34:52.440 align:start position:0%
relative to exclusion of incarceration
 
00:34:54.270 --> 00:34:54.280 align:start position:0%
as voluntary unemployment for the
 
00:34:56.950 --> 00:34:56.960 align:start position:0%
purposes of calculating child support
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
and our own representative David
 
00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:04.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:07.589 --> 00:35:07.599 align:start position:0%
sponsor thank you Mr
 
00:35:11.430 --> 00:35:11.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I'm here today to introduce HB
 
00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:15.040 align:start position:0%
1340 which is relative to exclusion of
 
00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:17.320 align:start position:0%
incarceration as voluntary unemployment
 
00:35:20.430 --> 00:35:20.440 align:start position:0%
for purposes of calculating child
 
00:35:24.270 --> 00:35:24.280 align:start position:0%
support and uh I got into this because
 
00:35:26.390 --> 00:35:26.400 align:start position:0%
this book this book was put out the
 
00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:27.510 align:start position:0%
this book this book was put out the
review

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%
review
 
00:35:29.790 --> 00:35:29.800 align:start position:0%
of uh New Hampshire child support
 
00:35:32.829 --> 00:35:32.839 align:start position:0%
guidelines back December of the last day
 
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:36.200 align:start position:0%
of 2022 and I started looking at it in
 
00:35:38.790 --> 00:35:38.800 align:start position:0%
January and uh they made a number of
 
00:35:41.870 --> 00:35:41.880 align:start position:0%
suggestions or recommendations in it um
 
00:35:43.790 --> 00:35:43.800 align:start position:0%
of which I seized upon a few and decided
 
00:35:46.470 --> 00:35:46.480 align:start position:0%
we'll clean some of the stuff up this is
 
00:35:50.589 --> 00:35:50.599 align:start position:0%
one of them on page 158 of this book
 
00:35:51.750 --> 00:35:51.760 align:start position:0%
there's a
 
00:35:53.829 --> 00:35:53.839 align:start position:0%
recommendation uh to do what we have in
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
front of us and that is to add
 
00:36:00.390 --> 00:36:00.400 align:start position:0%
to uh the
 
00:36:07.109 --> 00:36:07.119 align:start position:0%
RSA 458 C to Roman 4A provided that no
 
00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:10.760 align:start position:0%
case shall in uh incarceration be
 
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:12.640 align:start position:0%
considered voluntary
 
00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:15.280 align:start position:0%
unemployment and the reason that is is
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
because the Supreme
 
00:36:20.829 --> 00:36:20.839 align:start position:0%
Court um came down and it's on the
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
second page of what I passed you out
 
00:36:25.710 --> 00:36:25.720 align:start position:0%
that's the Supreme Court decision in
 
00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:28.069 align:start position:0%
that's the Supreme Court decision in
2014

00:36:28.069 --> 00:36:28.079 align:start position:0%
2014
 
00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:30.280 align:start position:0%
and most of the information on it is of
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
course on these decisions is on the back
 
00:36:35.870 --> 00:36:35.880 align:start position:0%
page or the next to last page
 
00:36:40.069 --> 00:36:40.079 align:start position:0%
um and it was uh it was judge lyen that
 
00:36:43.710 --> 00:36:43.720 align:start position:0%
sits right here that wrote wrote this on
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
the other day so
 
00:36:49.750 --> 00:36:49.760 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to read it just a
 
00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:51.440 align:start position:0%
bunch of stuff to you here let me see if
 
00:36:55.670 --> 00:36:55.680 align:start position:0%
I can shrink this up
 
00:36:55.680 --> 00:37:04.349 align:start position:0%
I can shrink this up
um

00:37:04.349 --> 00:37:04.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:06.829 --> 00:37:06.839 align:start position:0%
um no not
 
00:37:08.870 --> 00:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
that I thought I was
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
organized on the front page this where I
 
00:37:14.150 --> 00:37:14.160 align:start position:0%
should have start is this is about
 
00:37:16.790 --> 00:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
codifying New Hampshire case law that
 
00:37:18.470 --> 00:37:18.480 align:start position:0%
does not treat incarceration as
 
00:37:20.990 --> 00:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
voluntary unemployment the New Hampshire
 
00:37:23.190 --> 00:37:23.200 align:start position:0%
practices to consider the actual
 
00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:26.200 align:start position:0%
circumstances of a parent when income
 
00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:29.680 align:start position:0%
imput ation is authorized this would
 
00:37:31.390 --> 00:37:31.400 align:start position:0%
bring New Hampshire in compliance with
 
00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.710 align:start position:0%
bring New Hampshire in compliance with
the

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:32.720 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:37:35.950 --> 00:37:35.960 align:start position:0%
2016 added Federal requirements so
 
00:37:37.470 --> 00:37:37.480 align:start position:0%
that's the second reason so there's a
 
00:37:39.349 --> 00:37:39.359 align:start position:0%
case law that says don't do it and
 
00:37:41.309 --> 00:37:41.319 align:start position:0%
there's also the 2016 Federal
 
00:37:45.510 --> 00:37:45.520 align:start position:0%
requirements that says don't do it to uh
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
to un to unambiguously comply with the
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
requirement to not treat incarceration
 
00:37:54.630 --> 00:37:54.640 align:start position:0%
as voluntary employment there should be
 
00:37:57.150 --> 00:37:57.160 align:start position:0%
no exception in the provision
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
based on the reason for
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
incarceration now this doesn't mean that
 
00:38:05.190 --> 00:38:05.200 align:start position:0%
another source of income for this person
 
00:38:08.829 --> 00:38:08.839 align:start position:0%
that's incarcerated can't be tapped as I
 
00:38:11.270 --> 00:38:11.280 align:start position:0%
understand but you can't say well you
 
00:38:13.470 --> 00:38:13.480 align:start position:0%
still got to pay your child support just
 
00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:19.040 align:start position:0%
the same as if when you weren't um
 
00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:22.160 align:start position:0%
incarcerated so
 
00:38:24.470 --> 00:38:24.480 align:start position:0%
uh I'll take questions that's all I have
 
00:38:27.309 --> 00:38:27.319 align:start position:0%
to say right now oh J okay yeah
 
00:38:30.270 --> 00:38:30.280 align:start position:0%
um okay I saw you is good from that
 
00:38:33.230 --> 00:38:33.240 align:start position:0%
side I saw first hand up was Nelson and
 
00:38:34.230 --> 00:38:34.240 align:start position:0%
then I'm going down the road
 
00:38:36.349 --> 00:38:36.359 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you representative
 
00:38:45.150 --> 00:38:45.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:45.160 --> 00:38:46.710 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:38:46.710 --> 00:38:46.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:51.040 align:start position:0%
I um trying to work through this I'm not
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
trying to give you a hard time when I
 
00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
ask you that question I just want to
 
00:38:57.630 --> 00:38:57.640 align:start position:0%
preface this but um what uh so what you
 
00:39:01.790 --> 00:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
are saying is that child support can
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
be um can be revised yeah um and so that
 
00:39:10.750 --> 00:39:10.760 align:start position:0%
the period of time that the person is
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated there will be no
 
00:39:17.550 --> 00:39:17.560 align:start position:0%
aages um well you I believe I believe
 
00:39:20.950 --> 00:39:20.960 align:start position:0%
this is a change um that you'll drop
 
00:39:23.710 --> 00:39:23.720 align:start position:0%
down to the minimum amount because what
 
00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640 align:start position:0%
the decision is it's not voluntary uh
 
00:39:31.109 --> 00:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:33.710 --> 00:39:33.720 align:start position:0%
prison okay it used to be a case called
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
nden versus nden that uh the courts were
 
00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
relying on and people that were
 
00:39:40.630 --> 00:39:40.640 align:start position:0%
incarcerated would continue to have
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
their child support AC crew and of
 
00:39:44.230 --> 00:39:44.240 align:start position:0%
course when they get out now they go
 
00:39:45.870 --> 00:39:45.880 align:start position:0%
back because they hadn't they so far
 
00:39:47.510 --> 00:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
behind they couldn't pay
 
00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:52.800 align:start position:0%
it okay go ahead um okay I'm I'm getting
 
00:39:54.309 --> 00:39:54.319 align:start position:0%
I'm getting this the wheels are turning
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
thank you but um is is it um an unfair
 
00:40:04.270 --> 00:40:04.280 align:start position:0%
burden for the parent who has custody of
 
00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:08.200 align:start position:0%
the children to have that burden without
 
00:40:11.910 --> 00:40:11.920 align:start position:0%
being able to count on um
 
00:40:14.630 --> 00:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
aages during the time of incarceration
 
00:40:15.870 --> 00:40:15.880 align:start position:0%
it just can you help me work through
 
00:40:18.390 --> 00:40:18.400 align:start position:0%
that a little bit well your child
 
00:40:20.829 --> 00:40:20.839 align:start position:0%
support is generally uh say wage
 
00:40:22.670 --> 00:40:22.680 align:start position:0%
assignment yeah and they'll they'll take
 
00:40:24.750 --> 00:40:24.760 align:start position:0%
that out and like in this case the
 
00:40:29.069 --> 00:40:29.079 align:start position:0%
fellow was uh on job that um and he was
 
00:40:31.390 --> 00:40:31.400 align:start position:0%
arrested on lost his job because he was
 
00:40:33.710 --> 00:40:33.720 align:start position:0%
arrested prosecuted went to jail or
 
00:40:36.510 --> 00:40:36.520 align:start position:0%
prison I'm not sure which and uh so we
 
00:40:40.870 --> 00:40:40.880 align:start position:0%
couldn't pay and I think there's another
 
00:40:44.550 --> 00:40:44.560 align:start position:0%
um Supreme Court this I think the US
 
00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:46.720 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court I thought but you know the
 
00:40:48.349 --> 00:40:48.359 align:start position:0%
people behind me can probably answer
 
00:40:51.790 --> 00:40:51.800 align:start position:0%
that better than I can okay um you asked
 
00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:53.800 align:start position:0%
about fairness I I don't know if I can
 
00:40:56.710 --> 00:40:56.720 align:start position:0%
answer that but yeah as far as income is
 
00:40:58.270 --> 00:40:58.280 align:start position:0%
concerned they're not making income so
 
00:41:00.829 --> 00:41:00.839 align:start position:0%
therefore you can't garnish income they
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
don't have I think that's where it comes
 
00:41:04.670 --> 00:41:04.680 align:start position:0%
from but like I said when Justice Lyn is
 
00:41:06.550 --> 00:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
taking this room tomorrow well we can
 
00:41:09.309 --> 00:41:09.319 align:start position:0%
ask him because he wrote the
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
decision representative
 
00:41:14.190 --> 00:41:14.200 align:start position:0%
Greg I guess
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
I'm so I I understand the idea that they
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
didn't they weren't didn't voluntarily
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
become incarcerated but they did did
 
00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:27.280 align:start position:0%
they not voluntarily choose the action
 
00:41:28.670 --> 00:41:28.680 align:start position:0%
that led them to be
 
00:41:31.349 --> 00:41:31.359 align:start position:0%
incarcerated I I remember that back in
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
2004 when I was on the child support
 
00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
commission that was the answer well they
 
00:41:37.750 --> 00:41:37.760 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have done the crime then well
 
00:41:41.430 --> 00:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
yeah I just I mean it's um there are
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
some sorry followup yes thank you uh
 
00:41:47.230 --> 00:41:47.240 align:start position:0%
there are some spouses that will go to
 
00:41:52.030 --> 00:41:52.040 align:start position:0%
pretty um big lengths to not pay child
 
00:41:53.829 --> 00:41:53.839 align:start position:0%
support just out of a punishment or
 
00:41:57.430 --> 00:41:57.440 align:start position:0%
whatever so I guess in this case what
 
00:42:00.829 --> 00:42:00.839 align:start position:0%
protections are we giving to or holding
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
for the parent that has to then pay
 
00:42:05.390 --> 00:42:05.400 align:start position:0%
everything for the child well actually
 
00:42:06.950 --> 00:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
we're not doing anything more than just
 
00:42:09.390 --> 00:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
writing it into the statutes which is
 
00:42:12.150 --> 00:42:12.160 align:start position:0%
the the law books over there we're going
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
to have it in the law book so people can
 
00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:15.119 align:start position:0%
see it it's actually the law of the land
 
00:42:17.309 --> 00:42:17.319 align:start position:0%
now it's it's it's the law of New
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire now because the New Hampshire
 
00:42:21.750 --> 00:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court already ruled on it so
 
00:42:24.109 --> 00:42:24.119 align:start position:0%
that's all we're doing here is codifying
 
00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
could we have chapter and verse where it
 
00:42:31.040 --> 00:42:32.349 align:start position:0%
could we have chapter and verse where it
is

00:42:32.349 --> 00:42:32.359 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:42:34.670 --> 00:42:34.680 align:start position:0%
codified yeah well yeah I did read that
 
00:42:37.910 --> 00:42:37.920 align:start position:0%
too you want it again I yeah yeah it's
 
00:42:41.549 --> 00:42:41.559 align:start position:0%
in the bill it's in the first too huh
 
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:44.040 align:start position:0%
thank you yeah okay right the first
 
00:42:45.990 --> 00:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
sentence it's amazing what you can see
 
00:42:47.309 --> 00:42:47.319 align:start position:0%
just by
 
00:42:47.319 --> 00:42:49.670 align:start position:0%
just by
looking

00:42:49.670 --> 00:42:49.680 align:start position:0%
looking
 
00:42:52.950 --> 00:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
yeah well but the real the real experts
 
00:42:54.910 --> 00:42:54.920 align:start position:0%
on child sports are behind me I'm going
 
00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
to withdraw that um
 
00:43:00.990 --> 00:43:01.000 align:start position:0%
what I can see because RSA 458 C2 Roman
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
4 small
 
00:43:07.069 --> 00:43:07.079 align:start position:0%
a is amended by this bill yeah so it is
 
00:43:10.150 --> 00:43:10.160 align:start position:0%
not the law of the state presently well
 
00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880 align:start position:0%
it's case law of the state it's only
 
00:43:15.069 --> 00:43:15.079 align:start position:0%
case law only I beg you pardon uh that
 
00:43:17.230 --> 00:43:17.240 align:start position:0%
is uh I believe third in the
 
00:43:20.589 --> 00:43:20.599 align:start position:0%
hierarchy um of importance it's not
 
00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:23.359 align:start position:0%
unimportant but there are more important
 
00:43:25.150 --> 00:43:25.160 align:start position:0%
things which is why you're seeking to
 
00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240 align:start position:0%
get it into statutory law yes so it it
 
00:43:31.470 --> 00:43:31.480 align:start position:0%
is case law you're seeking to get it
 
00:43:36.190 --> 00:43:36.200 align:start position:0%
into statute exactly because of among
 
00:43:39.109 --> 00:43:39.119 align:start position:0%
other reasons the study and the fact
 
00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
that there was a Supreme Court decision
 
00:43:44.430 --> 00:43:44.440 align:start position:0%
in the state yes and do you have
 
00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:47.200 align:start position:0%
reference to that louder decision and I
 
00:43:48.670 --> 00:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
have that in the paper I passed out to
 
00:43:51.069 --> 00:43:51.079 align:start position:0%
you it's on the second second page is is
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
the the decision itself okay uh we will
 
00:43:56.230 --> 00:43:56.240 align:start position:0%
stop this brain cramp and now call on
 
00:43:58.589 --> 00:43:58.599 align:start position:0%
representative side Al sorry about that
 
00:44:00.870 --> 00:44:00.880 align:start position:0%
so thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:44:04.270 --> 00:44:04.280 align:start position:0%
taking my question um because they would
 
00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:05.480 align:start position:0%
not be if they're if they're
 
00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:07.680 align:start position:0%
involuntarily incarcerated and would not
 
00:44:09.670 --> 00:44:09.680 align:start position:0%
have to pay child support or pay the
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
minimum is there do you find that that
 
00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:15.000 align:start position:0%
there would be any room in your bill to
 
00:44:17.270 --> 00:44:17.280 align:start position:0%
amend it to make the payments that
 
00:44:20.230 --> 00:44:20.240 align:start position:0%
they're not no longer making retroactive
 
00:44:22.870 --> 00:44:22.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:25.589 --> 00:44:25.599 align:start position:0%
obligate um I have not done that of
 
00:44:27.870 --> 00:44:27.880 align:start position:0%
course as you can say um I'm just trying
 
00:44:30.630 --> 00:44:30.640 align:start position:0%
to get it into the statute books because
 
00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:33.680 align:start position:0%
of the recommendation that came from the
 
00:44:37.069 --> 00:44:37.079 align:start position:0%
um this the the people that studied the
 
00:44:41.870 --> 00:44:41.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:44.430 --> 00:44:44.440 align:start position:0%
$116,000 um to have this report and
 
00:44:45.870 --> 00:44:45.880 align:start position:0%
every four years we have another one the
 
00:44:48.710 --> 00:44:48.720 align:start position:0%
last one was about $140 I believe, and
 
00:44:50.309 --> 00:44:50.319 align:start position:0%
they made a recommendation says Hey
 
00:44:51.950 --> 00:44:51.960 align:start position:0%
because of the Supreme Court decision
 
00:44:54.549 --> 00:44:54.559 align:start position:0%
you should and the 2016
 
00:44:58.109 --> 00:44:58.119 align:start position:0%
Federal uh decisions and I should call
 
00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:01.960 align:start position:0%
decision the uh uh the government
 
00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:05.040 align:start position:0%
Congress uh changed some laws and said
 
00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
we need to do this so it's just a matter
 
00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:08.920 align:start position:0%
of getting it out there so it's in the
 
00:45:13.190 --> 00:45:13.200 align:start position:0%
open I uh to digress a little bit I I
 
00:45:16.349 --> 00:45:16.359 align:start position:0%
did a bill here in judiciary and it was
 
00:45:17.470 --> 00:45:17.480 align:start position:0%
because the New Hampshire Municipal
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
Association was going around and telling
 
00:45:23.230 --> 00:45:23.240 align:start position:0%
the towns in the school district that uh
 
00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:26.200 align:start position:0%
they couldn't accept electronic uh uh
 
00:45:28.190 --> 00:45:28.200 align:start position:0%
write to no requests and send out
 
00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
electronic information and so that was
 
00:45:34.069 --> 00:45:34.079 align:start position:0%
really bogging things down and so I
 
00:45:35.990 --> 00:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
filed the bill to make it the way we've
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
been doing it and lo behold the lady
 
00:45:40.829 --> 00:45:40.839 align:start position:0%
called me up and says you know what
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
judge Glenn already signed a decision on
 
00:45:46.910 --> 00:45:46.920 align:start position:0%
that it's called the green decision and
 
00:45:49.630 --> 00:45:49.640 align:start position:0%
uh so everybody thought it was still a
 
00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:51.280 align:start position:0%
really good idea to get these things
 
00:45:53.430 --> 00:45:53.440 align:start position:0%
into the statute books instead of
 
00:45:54.630 --> 00:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
because people don't I think they call
 
00:45:57.390 --> 00:45:57.400 align:start position:0%
it Shepherd eyes um and go back and see
 
00:45:59.270 --> 00:45:59.280 align:start position:0%
what case law has decided on these
 
00:46:00.910 --> 00:46:00.920 align:start position:0%
things so if you already got a statute
 
00:46:03.829 --> 00:46:03.839 align:start position:0%
that talks about it you might as well
 
00:46:06.390 --> 00:46:06.400 align:start position:0%
put it in there so it's in one place
 
00:46:09.430 --> 00:46:09.440 align:start position:0%
that's all we're really doing here yeah
 
00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:10.710 align:start position:0%
that's all we're really doing here yeah
representative

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:46:13.549 --> 00:46:13.559 align:start position:0%
Gibbons thank you Mr chairman uh there
 
00:46:17.589 --> 00:46:17.599 align:start position:0%
is a separate bill in the house this
 
00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:21.520 align:start position:0%
year that I believe um that wants to
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
raise the minimum wage of uh imprisoned
 
00:46:28.990 --> 00:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
people people to the state minimum wage
 
00:46:32.430 --> 00:46:32.440 align:start position:0%
um so I'm wondering how that would
 
00:46:35.430 --> 00:46:35.440 align:start position:0%
work uh I I I have a lot of questions
 
00:46:37.549 --> 00:46:37.559 align:start position:0%
about that bill in general uh but I'm
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
wondering how that would
 
00:46:42.589 --> 00:46:42.599 align:start position:0%
work in conjunction with this bill well
 
00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:44.800 align:start position:0%
I would think if it got a high enough I
 
00:46:46.109 --> 00:46:46.119 align:start position:0%
mean if they're does that mean they're
 
00:46:48.230 --> 00:46:48.240 align:start position:0%
employed they have sources they still
 
00:46:50.309 --> 00:46:50.319 align:start position:0%
have sources like I said it doesn't it
 
00:46:52.030 --> 00:46:52.040 align:start position:0%
doesn't excuse if you have other sources
 
00:46:55.069 --> 00:46:55.079 align:start position:0%
of income MH but you can't say that
 
00:46:57.150 --> 00:46:57.160 align:start position:0%
they're voluntary that's all the bill
 
00:46:59.510 --> 00:46:59.520 align:start position:0%
and this decision does you can't claim
 
00:47:01.390 --> 00:47:01.400 align:start position:0%
that person voluntarily unemployed
 
00:47:02.390 --> 00:47:02.400 align:start position:0%
because there are people that have done
 
00:47:03.549 --> 00:47:03.559 align:start position:0%
that you know say I don't have to pay
 
00:47:07.069 --> 00:47:07.079 align:start position:0%
jobs I'm not working I quit and so right
 
00:47:08.549 --> 00:47:08.559 align:start position:0%
so then the government came back and
 
00:47:11.430 --> 00:47:11.440 align:start position:0%
says well we know how to handle that but
 
00:47:12.870 --> 00:47:12.880 align:start position:0%
it got too far out of hand and that's
 
00:47:15.349 --> 00:47:15.359 align:start position:0%
like I said uh that's when this decision
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
came along sure yeah I understand that
 
00:47:18.790 --> 00:47:18.800 align:start position:0%
I'm just wondering how those two would
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
work because if in other words if
 
00:47:24.390 --> 00:47:24.400 align:start position:0%
they're if they're not voluntarily
 
00:47:27.150 --> 00:47:27.160 align:start position:0%
unemployed and then they're making money
 
00:47:30.390 --> 00:47:30.400 align:start position:0%
in the prison system then shouldn't that
 
00:47:33.549 --> 00:47:33.559 align:start position:0%
come together and because if they were
 
00:47:35.589 --> 00:47:35.599 align:start position:0%
if they're making the state minimum wage
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how many hours they're
 
00:47:39.549 --> 00:47:39.559 align:start position:0%
expected to work and I'm not sure if
 
00:47:41.910 --> 00:47:41.920 align:start position:0%
they can choose their hours there's a
 
00:47:43.910 --> 00:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
lot that I don't know about the what
 
00:47:47.470 --> 00:47:47.480 align:start position:0%
what how it works but if they're working
 
00:47:51.309 --> 00:47:51.319 align:start position:0%
40 hours a week at State minimum wage as
 
00:47:54.829 --> 00:47:54.839 align:start position:0%
a as an imprisoned person then I would
 
00:47:56.309 --> 00:47:56.319 align:start position:0%
think that they would ow ch child
 
00:47:58.870 --> 00:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
support my guess is they would still be
 
00:48:00.510 --> 00:48:00.520 align:start position:0%
expected to pay child support if they
 
00:48:02.630 --> 00:48:02.640 align:start position:0%
got money they can pay child support
 
00:48:04.910 --> 00:48:04.920 align:start position:0%
right that's just that's my guess again
 
00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:07.000 align:start position:0%
there's people behind me that's much
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
that's just much more knowledge than
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
that than I have right and and we we
 
00:48:12.349 --> 00:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
still need to know if that bill is even
 
00:48:14.710 --> 00:48:14.720 align:start position:0%
going to pass but it's just in the works
 
00:48:18.069 --> 00:48:18.079 align:start position:0%
this current year legislative year so I
 
00:48:20.309 --> 00:48:20.319 align:start position:0%
would just wonder how they would work
 
00:48:22.430 --> 00:48:22.440 align:start position:0%
together yeah I guess I should say I
 
00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:23.790 align:start position:0%
together yeah I guess I should say I
don't

00:48:23.790 --> 00:48:23.800 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:26.880 align:start position:0%
know I S hand this way did I see a hand
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
this way there was a hand this way
 
00:48:31.630 --> 00:48:31.640 align:start position:0%
representative ball thank you chairman
 
00:48:32.750 --> 00:48:32.760 align:start position:0%
um and thank you for being here and
 
00:48:35.349 --> 00:48:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for presenting this bill um my
 
00:48:38.430 --> 00:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
question and excuse me if I I have to
 
00:48:39.630 --> 00:48:39.640 align:start position:0%
ask the question because I'm a little
 
00:48:43.430 --> 00:48:43.440 align:start position:0%
bit confused for a family will this make
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
a difference of the eligibility for
 
00:48:50.990 --> 00:48:51.000 align:start position:0%
social support if as the difference
 
00:48:53.430 --> 00:48:53.440 align:start position:0%
between a parent just not paying so he's
 
00:48:55.230 --> 00:48:55.240 align:start position:0%
weigh in a rears versus the parent who
 
00:48:57.750 --> 00:48:57.760 align:start position:0%
is in incarcerated and can't pay will
 
00:49:00.670 --> 00:49:00.680 align:start position:0%
that allow the um parent who has a
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
custody during that time period would
 
00:49:04.910 --> 00:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
they get more Social Services while he's
 
00:49:07.230 --> 00:49:07.240 align:start position:0%
incarcerated so that they can um
 
00:49:08.829 --> 00:49:08.839 align:start position:0%
continue to
 
00:49:11.670 --> 00:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
live this bill actually doesn't do
 
00:49:14.710 --> 00:49:14.720 align:start position:0%
anything that we're not changing
 
00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
anything by putting this bill on the law
 
00:49:18.630 --> 00:49:18.640 align:start position:0%
is already set all we're doing is moving
 
00:49:22.349 --> 00:49:22.359 align:start position:0%
it into the statute books okay it's
 
00:49:24.510 --> 00:49:24.520 align:start position:0%
thank you it's already
 
00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.630 align:start position:0%
thank you it's already
there

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:26.640 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:49:28.829 --> 00:49:28.839 align:start position:0%
representative deimon thank you Mr
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:49:34.270 --> 00:49:34.280 align:start position:0%
question am I correct
 
00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
that and please correct me if I'm not
 
00:49:42.030 --> 00:49:42.040 align:start position:0%
that any erages incurred while the
 
00:49:44.910 --> 00:49:44.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerated person is incarcerated just
 
00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.190 align:start position:0%
incarcerated person is incarcerated just
goes

00:49:46.190 --> 00:49:46.200 align:start position:0%
goes
 
00:49:49.430 --> 00:49:49.440 align:start position:0%
away I don't think so again there that
 
00:49:51.710 --> 00:49:51.720 align:start position:0%
save that question because Susan Bon is
 
00:49:54.309 --> 00:49:54.319 align:start position:0%

thank you for your testimony and of
 
00:50:09.430 --> 00:50:09.440 align:start position:0%
course the chair calls Susan
 
00:50:21.190 --> 00:50:21.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:23.190 --> 00:50:23.200 align:start position:0%
questions don't you
 
00:50:31.950 --> 00:50:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:33.870 --> 00:50:33.880 align:start position:0%
good morning I'm Susan Bren I'm the
 
00:50:35.349 --> 00:50:35.359 align:start position:0%
chief staff attorney for the office of
 
00:50:37.190 --> 00:50:37.200 align:start position:0%
child support in the uh Department of
 
00:50:39.670 --> 00:50:39.680 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services and we are
 
00:50:42.230 --> 00:50:42.240 align:start position:0%
here in support of this bill which has
 
00:50:45.589 --> 00:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
been wonderfully described by
 
00:50:48.309 --> 00:50:48.319 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford already
 
00:50:51.549 --> 00:50:51.559 align:start position:0%
um as he said we we have the case of
 
00:50:55.150 --> 00:50:55.160 align:start position:0%
lounder which was decided in 2014 which
 
00:50:56.510 --> 00:50:56.520 align:start position:0%
basic basically
 
00:51:01.349 --> 00:51:01.359 align:start position:0%
said um being incarcerated cannot be
 
00:51:02.950 --> 00:51:02.960 align:start position:0%
held to be equivalent to being
 
00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.910 align:start position:0%
held to be equivalent to being
voluntarily

00:51:04.910 --> 00:51:04.920 align:start position:0%
voluntarily
 
00:51:07.990 --> 00:51:08.000 align:start position:0%
underemployed um so we had it in in the
 
00:51:10.710 --> 00:51:10.720 align:start position:0%
case so we've been going under that rule
 
00:51:13.829 --> 00:51:13.839 align:start position:0%
since then but um our federal
 
00:51:16.430 --> 00:51:16.440 align:start position:0%
counterparts have asked us to uh put it
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
actually in the guidelines because it's
 
00:51:22.069 --> 00:51:22.079 align:start position:0%
required by the uh code of feder federal
 
00:51:23.710 --> 00:51:23.720 align:start position:0%
regulations to be in the guidelines as
 
00:51:26.109 --> 00:51:26.119 align:start position:0%
opposed to being just a case
 
00:51:27.789 --> 00:51:27.799 align:start position:0%
so that's what that's what this bill
 
00:51:27.799 --> 00:51:30.750 align:start position:0%
so that's what that's what this bill
does

00:51:30.750 --> 00:51:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:33.109 --> 00:51:33.119 align:start position:0%
um I thought I would address the math
 
00:51:38.630 --> 00:51:38.640 align:start position:0%
problem um if and I have no idea
 
00:51:41.470 --> 00:51:41.480 align:start position:0%
how decisions are made of how anybody
 
00:51:43.630 --> 00:51:43.640 align:start position:0%
becomes employed if they're incarcerated
 
00:51:46.109 --> 00:51:46.119 align:start position:0%
but if they're making 725 an hour 40
 
00:51:48.510 --> 00:51:48.520 align:start position:0%
hours a week which I doubt would happen
 
00:51:51.069 --> 00:51:51.079 align:start position:0%
and then multiplying it by 4.33 because
 
00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
that's how many weeks there are in a
 
00:51:55.510 --> 00:51:55.520 align:start position:0%
year or sorry weeks there are in a month
 
00:52:00.190 --> 00:52:00.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:03.750 --> 00:52:03.760 align:start position:0%
$1,255 70 Which is less than the minute
 
00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:06.040 align:start position:0%
than the self-support reserve because
 
00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:08.040 align:start position:0%
the self- support Reserve is $ 1397
 
00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
which means it would be a $50 a month
 
00:52:12.230 --> 00:52:12.240 align:start position:0%
order which is what would happen under
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
the for these types of cases anyway it
 
00:52:16.349 --> 00:52:16.359 align:start position:0%
becomes a $50 it's a $50 a month order
 
00:52:19.829 --> 00:52:19.839 align:start position:0%
that continues to acre while the person
 
00:52:22.390 --> 00:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
is incarcerated then when they get out
 
00:52:24.069 --> 00:52:24.079 align:start position:0%
they're supposed to report back in to
 
00:52:26.030 --> 00:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
let us know what's happening
 
00:52:27.829 --> 00:52:27.839 align:start position:0%
and hopefully they're working cuz
 
00:52:29.069 --> 00:52:29.079 align:start position:0%
hopefully they're coming out they're on
 
00:52:30.549 --> 00:52:30.559 align:start position:0%
parole they have to have a job they have
 
00:52:32.230 --> 00:52:32.240 align:start position:0%
to have a you know place to live they
 
00:52:34.270 --> 00:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
let us know where they're working we
 
00:52:37.950 --> 00:52:37.960 align:start position:0%
recalculate their child support and move
 
00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.720 --> 00:52:44.910 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:52:44.910 --> 00:52:44.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.920 --> 00:52:46.549 align:start position:0%

representative
 
00:52:49.470 --> 00:52:49.480 align:start position:0%
Gibbons thank you Mr chairman and you
 
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
are absolutely correct it is
 
00:52:53.109 --> 00:52:53.119 align:start position:0%
representative given despite what my
 
00:52:55.789 --> 00:52:55.799 align:start position:0%
name plate says um
 
00:52:59.150 --> 00:52:59.160 align:start position:0%
I am just wondering
 
00:53:02.150 --> 00:53:02.160 align:start position:0%
uh maybe this is a question more for CJ
 
00:53:04.870 --> 00:53:04.880 align:start position:0%
but uh for the criminal justice
 
00:53:07.750 --> 00:53:07.760 align:start position:0%
committee but is it
 
00:53:12.910 --> 00:53:12.920 align:start position:0%
still is it still on uh applications for
 
00:53:15.589 --> 00:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
work that you have to disclose if you've
 
00:53:15.599 --> 00:53:16.670 align:start position:0%
work that you have to disclose if you've
been

00:53:16.670 --> 00:53:16.680 align:start position:0%
been
 
00:53:20.829 --> 00:53:20.839 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and if so then isn't that a
 
00:53:24.150 --> 00:53:24.160 align:start position:0%
barrier for them getting a job once
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
they're out of prison and if so then
 
00:53:30.069 --> 00:53:30.079 align:start position:0%
that it presents a barrier for paying
 
00:53:33.030 --> 00:53:33.040 align:start position:0%
child support So shouldn't we get rid of
 
00:53:35.150 --> 00:53:35.160 align:start position:0%
that I don't I don't know I don't think
 
00:53:36.670 --> 00:53:36.680 align:start position:0%
it's a requirement that it has to be on
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
an application for for employment with
 
00:53:42.230 --> 00:53:42.240 align:start position:0%
regards to I think that they can ask and
 
00:53:44.549 --> 00:53:44.559 align:start position:0%
then you can answer or not answer but
 
00:53:46.390 --> 00:53:46.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure
 
00:53:49.390 --> 00:53:49.400 align:start position:0%
how somebody's choice
 
00:53:52.670 --> 00:53:52.680 align:start position:0%
to get in trouble with the law then
 
00:53:54.430 --> 00:53:54.440 align:start position:0%
somehow makes it so that they don't have
 
00:53:57.510 --> 00:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
to uh pay child support right a lot of
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
this all has to do with ability to pay
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
which is what one of the the things that
 
00:54:05.589 --> 00:54:05.599 align:start position:0%
our federal counterparts have been um
 
00:54:07.109 --> 00:54:07.119 align:start position:0%
asking us
 
00:54:10.589 --> 00:54:10.599 align:start position:0%
to concentrate on and that uh we do a
 
00:54:12.470 --> 00:54:12.480 align:start position:0%
three-year review people can ask for a
 
00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:13.640 align:start position:0%
three-year review if they're not on
 
00:54:15.510 --> 00:54:15.520 align:start position:0%
tanif tanif cases are reviewed every
 
00:54:18.030 --> 00:54:18.040 align:start position:0%
three years to make sure that the the
 
00:54:20.349 --> 00:54:20.359 align:start position:0%
order is the right size for for the
 
00:54:22.750 --> 00:54:22.760 align:start position:0%
parties based on their circumstances so
 
00:54:24.870 --> 00:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
this is part of that in that somebody
 
00:54:26.910 --> 00:54:26.920 align:start position:0%
who's incarcerated who has no income or
 
00:54:29.710 --> 00:54:29.720 align:start position:0%
minimum income their order should be
 
00:54:31.430 --> 00:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
right sized
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
to the minimum or it can actually be
 
00:54:36.390 --> 00:54:36.400 align:start position:0%
zero we don't we ask for a $50 a month
 
00:54:38.589 --> 00:54:38.599 align:start position:0%
order the courts can order
 
00:54:41.190 --> 00:54:41.200 align:start position:0%
zero and then have it have it be
 
00:54:43.670 --> 00:54:43.680 align:start position:0%
elsewhere and as representative Bickford
 
00:54:46.470 --> 00:54:46.480 align:start position:0%
said that um it's not doesn't
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
automatically go to $50 a month we would
 
00:54:51.549 --> 00:54:51.559 align:start position:0%
have to do a analysis to make sure that
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
there there weren't other um income out
 
00:54:57.190 --> 00:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
there that would mean that there should
 
00:54:58.990 --> 00:54:59.000 align:start position:0%
actually be a child support order that
 
00:55:00.430 --> 00:55:00.440 align:start position:0%
we and hopefully one that we could
 
00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720 align:start position:0%
actually access while somebody's in
 
00:55:06.549 --> 00:55:06.559 align:start position:0%
incarcerated representative deimon thank
 
00:55:08.589 --> 00:55:08.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr
 
00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
chairman so am I correct that this
 
00:55:14.510 --> 00:55:14.520 align:start position:0%
particular bill will
 
00:55:18.789 --> 00:55:18.799 align:start position:0%
only change the provision that an
 
00:55:21.309 --> 00:55:21.319 align:start position:0%
incarcerated individual will not be held
 
00:55:21.319 --> 00:55:22.670 align:start position:0%
incarcerated individual will not be held
in

00:55:22.670 --> 00:55:22.680 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:55:25.630 --> 00:55:25.640 align:start position:0%
contempt for not paying child's support
 
00:55:25.640 --> 00:55:26.710 align:start position:0%
contempt for not paying child's support
while

00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
while
 
00:55:28.910 --> 00:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
incarcerated is that pretty much what
 
00:55:30.589 --> 00:55:30.599 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
00:55:32.710 --> 00:55:32.720 align:start position:0%
says I I don't think it has anything to
 
00:55:35.910 --> 00:55:35.920 align:start position:0%
do with contempt but it it basically
 
00:55:39.750 --> 00:55:39.760 align:start position:0%
says that it changes the let me give you
 
00:55:41.190 --> 00:55:41.200 align:start position:0%
an example it's probably helpful in the
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
olden days before the lounder case
 
00:55:45.910 --> 00:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
people who were incarcerated would file
 
00:55:48.549 --> 00:55:48.559 align:start position:0%
a motion for modification for the court
 
00:55:50.630 --> 00:55:50.640 align:start position:0%
saying I don't have income because I'm
 
00:55:52.710 --> 00:55:52.720 align:start position:0%
incarcerated and the courts were
 
00:55:54.230 --> 00:55:54.240 align:start position:0%
required to have a hearing on it and
 
00:55:57.910 --> 00:55:57.920 align:start position:0%
then would say you're voluntarily under
 
00:56:00.109 --> 00:56:00.119 align:start position:0%
unemployed because you voluntarily did
 
00:56:01.829 --> 00:56:01.839 align:start position:0%
something to make yourself incarcerated
 
00:56:03.270 --> 00:56:03.280 align:start position:0%
we're not changing your child support go
 
00:56:05.630 --> 00:56:05.640 align:start position:0%
back to jail and so then it would
 
00:56:07.270 --> 00:56:07.280 align:start position:0%
continue to increase at whatever
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
whatever number it is all this is saying
 
00:56:12.230 --> 00:56:12.240 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:56:16.910 --> 00:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
the his a somebody who's incarcerated is
 
00:56:21.789 --> 00:56:21.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:24.430 --> 00:56:24.440 align:start position:0%
underemployed so it allows it to go
 
00:56:26.510 --> 00:56:26.520 align:start position:0%
allows the order to go to that $50 a
 
00:56:28.190 --> 00:56:28.200 align:start position:0%
month or zero whatever the Court decides
 
00:56:30.549 --> 00:56:30.559 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate number M while
 
00:56:31.990 --> 00:56:32.000 align:start position:0%
they're incarcerated and then once
 
00:56:34.589 --> 00:56:34.599 align:start position:0%
they're un incarcerated we review it
 
00:56:37.750 --> 00:56:37.760 align:start position:0%
again and hopefully they've they're
 
00:56:41.710 --> 00:56:41.720 align:start position:0%
working and we can put in a more
 
00:56:44.549 --> 00:56:44.559 align:start position:0%
uh gain Full Employment and you know
 
00:56:47.309 --> 00:56:47.319 align:start position:0%
more income for the the uh family thank
 
00:56:49.750 --> 00:56:49.760 align:start position:0%
you am I correct Council I'm assuming
 
00:56:52.870 --> 00:56:52.880 align:start position:0%
that if an individual is now led out of
 
00:56:55.349 --> 00:56:55.359 align:start position:0%
prison and cannot get a job because a
 
00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
lot of people do not want to hire xcon
 
00:57:01.109 --> 00:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
and can demonstrate good faith effort in
 
00:57:03.950 --> 00:57:03.960 align:start position:0%
trying to get a job but still has no
 
00:57:07.750 --> 00:57:07.760 align:start position:0%
money from a job that's not what we're
 
00:57:09.230 --> 00:57:09.240 align:start position:0%
dealing with here at all that's
 
00:57:11.630 --> 00:57:11.640 align:start position:0%
something else that's correct literally
 
00:57:12.990 --> 00:57:13.000 align:start position:0%
correct this is only having to deal with
 
00:57:14.589 --> 00:57:14.599 align:start position:0%
people who are actually incarcerated
 
00:57:16.990 --> 00:57:17.000 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Vice chairman
 
00:57:19.270 --> 00:57:19.280 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
00:57:23.109 --> 00:57:23.119 align:start position:0%
taking my question um so I owe $150 a
 
00:57:25.670 --> 00:57:25.680 align:start position:0%
week I get incarcerated do you have
 
00:57:29.270 --> 00:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
access to my accounts savings accounts
 
00:57:32.270 --> 00:57:32.280 align:start position:0%
assets um do you have access to
 
00:57:36.829 --> 00:57:36.839 align:start position:0%
that um it's possible it it it really
 
00:57:39.829 --> 00:57:39.839 align:start position:0%
depends factually on what's Happening um
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
we do have the ability to lean people's
 
00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:43.910 align:start position:0%
we do have the ability to lean people's
bank

00:57:43.910 --> 00:57:43.920 align:start position:0%
bank
 
00:57:46.430 --> 00:57:46.440 align:start position:0%
accounts but it has to be over a certain
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
amount right and then we have to know
 
00:57:51.230 --> 00:57:51.240 align:start position:0%
about it um to to do that but yes we do
 
00:57:53.789 --> 00:57:53.799 align:start position:0%
we do still have the ability to
 
00:57:56.309 --> 00:57:56.319 align:start position:0%
enforce while somebody's incarcerated so
 
00:57:59.190 --> 00:57:59.200 align:start position:0%
if they owe a lot of money coming in we
 
00:58:02.789 --> 00:58:02.799 align:start position:0%
can still enforce if if somebody um
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
inherits a lot of money while they're
 
00:58:06.750 --> 00:58:06.760 align:start position:0%
incarcerated we can put a lean on that
 
00:58:10.630 --> 00:58:10.640 align:start position:0%
to pay pay off so follow up follow up uh
 
00:58:13.349 --> 00:58:13.359 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um
 
00:58:16.710 --> 00:58:16.720 align:start position:0%
so so this the change of this language
 
00:58:19.950 --> 00:58:19.960 align:start position:0%
allows me incarcerated to modify
 
00:58:23.270 --> 00:58:23.280 align:start position:0%
correct so if I owe if I owe $150 a
 
00:58:28.309 --> 00:58:28.319 align:start position:0%
month and I have um I have $30,000 in my
 
00:58:28.319 --> 00:58:29.470 align:start position:0%
month and I have um I have $30,000 in my
savings

00:58:29.470 --> 00:58:29.480 align:start position:0%
savings
 
00:58:32.549 --> 00:58:32.559 align:start position:0%
account uh that you don't know about uh
 
00:58:34.950 --> 00:58:34.960 align:start position:0%
I could modify to the $50 a
 
00:58:38.390 --> 00:58:38.400 align:start position:0%
month and take it from that $30,000
 
00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.349 align:start position:0%
month and take it from that $30,000
savings

00:58:40.349 --> 00:58:40.359 align:start position:0%
savings
 
00:58:42.549 --> 00:58:42.559 align:start position:0%
account I mean that that that's what I'm
 
00:58:44.109 --> 00:58:44.119 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out is this an
 
00:58:47.470 --> 00:58:47.480 align:start position:0%
advantage for being incarcerated to
 
00:58:50.950 --> 00:58:50.960 align:start position:0%
modify uh when I have assets I well I
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
suppose it's possible if you're going to
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
lie to the court when you f when you
 
00:58:56.589 --> 00:58:56.599 align:start position:0%
file for a motion I'm incarcerated so
 
00:58:59.910 --> 00:58:59.920 align:start position:0%
well but when when chances are yeah when
 
00:59:02.589 --> 00:59:02.599 align:start position:0%
you file a motion for
 
00:59:05.230 --> 00:59:05.240 align:start position:0%
modification you have to fill out a
 
00:59:07.870 --> 00:59:07.880 align:start position:0%
financial affidavit under oath yeah that
 
00:59:10.029 --> 00:59:10.039 align:start position:0%
asks you about that type of things okay
 
00:59:13.390 --> 00:59:13.400 align:start position:0%
I would also assume that your ex or
 
00:59:14.829 --> 00:59:14.839 align:start position:0%
other people in your life might know
 
00:59:17.470 --> 00:59:17.480 align:start position:0%
about things like that and we might find
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
out and then so it's not an automatic
 
00:59:20.910 --> 00:59:20.920 align:start position:0%
you actually have to have a hearing on
 
00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
it okay right all right thank
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:25.750 align:start position:0%
it okay right all right thank
you

00:59:25.750 --> 00:59:25.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:59:27.270 --> 00:59:27.280 align:start position:0%
any other
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
questions saying none thank you so much
 
00:59:32.190 --> 00:59:32.200 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome is it the what do
 
00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.950 align:start position:0%
you're very welcome is it the what do

think what do you think folks we want to
 
00:59:41.510 --> 00:59:41.520 align:start position:0%
go on to exec or you want to
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%

00:59:50.910 --> 00:59:50.920 align:start position:0%
exact okay I closed the hearing on House
 
00:59:53.670 --> 00:59:53.680 align:start position:0%
Bill 1340 and I open an exact session on
 
00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:55.150 align:start position:0%
Bill 1340 and I open an exact session on
1340

00:59:55.150 --> 00:59:55.160 align:start position:0%
1340
 
00:59:57.230 --> 00:59:57.240 align:start position:0%
and the chair calls on representative
 
01:00:01.029 --> 01:00:01.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:05.240 align:start position:0%
motion I make a motion to um ought to
 
01:00:09.150 --> 01:00:09.160 align:start position:0%
pass on HB 1340 could I have a second
 
01:00:12.270 --> 01:00:12.280 align:start position:0%
preferably from a person whose name I
 
01:00:14.750 --> 01:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
know representative
 
01:00:18.349 --> 01:00:18.359 align:start position:0%
Gibbons yes I would like to second that
 
01:00:20.150 --> 01:00:20.160 align:start position:0%
okay any
 
01:00:22.950 --> 01:00:22.960 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Gibbons thank
 
01:00:25.990 --> 01:00:26.000 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman um to address uh
 
01:00:31.549 --> 01:00:31.559 align:start position:0%
representative long um I suppose someone
 
01:00:36.910 --> 01:00:36.920 align:start position:0%
could maybe get incarcerated just to
 
01:00:39.549 --> 01:00:39.559 align:start position:0%
address their child support but I really
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
don't expect that someone would do that
 
01:00:44.109 --> 01:00:44.119 align:start position:0%
because it would follow them there would
 
01:00:47.750 --> 01:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
be so many negative uh secondary effects
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
to being incarcerated I I just I mean I
 
01:00:52.230 --> 01:00:52.240 align:start position:0%
mean just because someone can doesn't
 
01:00:54.230 --> 01:00:54.240 align:start position:0%
mean someone should and I I just don't
 
01:00:57.150 --> 01:00:57.160 align:start position:0%
think think an average person would want
 
01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:03.829 --> 01:01:03.839 align:start position:0%
route yeah I'm not I'm not saying that
 
01:01:05.630 --> 01:01:05.640 align:start position:0%
somebody wants to get incarcerated to
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
lower but if I get incarcerated I have
 
01:01:11.430 --> 01:01:11.440 align:start position:0%
an advantage of lowering my modification
 
01:01:12.549 --> 01:01:12.559 align:start position:0%
because this is
 
01:01:15.270 --> 01:01:15.280 align:start position:0%
involuntary um you know so that's what
 
01:01:17.870 --> 01:01:17.880 align:start position:0%
I'm saying if I owe 150 and I'm
 
01:01:19.789 --> 01:01:19.799 align:start position:0%
incarcerated I'll take advantage of
 
01:01:22.789 --> 01:01:22.799 align:start position:0%
going to 50 I don't have a job and I
 
01:01:25.390 --> 01:01:25.400 align:start position:0%
have $30,000 on my savings account
 
01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:28.200 align:start position:0%
yeah so but I wonder how many times
 
01:01:30.589 --> 01:01:30.599 align:start position:0%
we've ever heard somebody on a happy
 
01:01:34.230 --> 01:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
little sunny afternoon say I know I'm
 
01:01:36.829 --> 01:01:36.839 align:start position:0%
going to go break the law so I don't
 
01:01:39.710 --> 01:01:39.720 align:start position:0%
have to pay child support I I don't
 
01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.390 align:start position:0%
have to pay child support I I don't
think

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:41.400 align:start position:0%
think
 
01:01:43.950 --> 01:01:43.960 align:start position:0%
so that's exactly what I was getting at
 
01:01:47.150 --> 01:01:47.160 align:start position:0%
was that I don't think okay yeah I I was
 
01:01:50.470 --> 01:01:50.480 align:start position:0%
not thinking that someone would actively
 
01:01:52.269 --> 01:01:52.279 align:start position:0%
break the law just to get out of child
 
01:01:55.670 --> 01:01:55.680 align:start position:0%
support that just doesn't seem normal
 
01:01:57.309 --> 01:01:57.319 align:start position:0%
anyone else wish to weigh in
 
01:01:59.710 --> 01:01:59.720 align:start position:0%
representative Panic thank you for
 
01:02:02.430 --> 01:02:02.440 align:start position:0%
taking my question my or my comment
 
01:02:06.349 --> 01:02:06.359 align:start position:0%
there comments yeah comments um I think
 
01:02:10.109 --> 01:02:10.119 align:start position:0%
this is a way to protect
 
01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:13.480 align:start position:0%
the person being incarcerated from from
 
01:02:16.069 --> 01:02:16.079 align:start position:0%
us taking blood out of a
 
01:02:18.549 --> 01:02:18.559 align:start position:0%
rock I mean if you don't have the money
 
01:02:21.470 --> 01:02:21.480 align:start position:0%
you don't have the money and once they
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
do get out of jail we want to be able to
 
01:02:26.829 --> 01:02:26.839 align:start position:0%
get them back on track and I think this
 
01:02:29.990 --> 01:02:30.000 align:start position:0%
brings them to that point Thank
 
01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:31.829 align:start position:0%
brings them to that point Thank
You

01:02:31.829 --> 01:02:31.839 align:start position:0%
You
 
01:02:35.069 --> 01:02:35.079 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons yes thank you Mr
 
01:02:37.470 --> 01:02:37.480 align:start position:0%
chairman and to address that point
 
01:02:39.430 --> 01:02:39.440 align:start position:0%
that's that's why I brought up that
 
01:02:42.510 --> 01:02:42.520 align:start position:0%
maybe we should make sure that the
 
01:02:44.430 --> 01:02:44.440 align:start position:0%
criminal maybe we need to do it next
 
01:02:47.269 --> 01:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
legislative year but the make sure that
 
01:02:51.789 --> 01:02:51.799 align:start position:0%
the criminal justice system does not ask
 
01:02:54.710 --> 01:02:54.720 align:start position:0%
about uh incarceration on job
 
01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
applications because if that becomes a
 
01:02:59.990 --> 01:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
barrier to them getting a job then how
 
01:03:01.470 --> 01:03:01.480 align:start position:0%
are they going to get back on track on
 
01:03:05.150 --> 01:03:05.160 align:start position:0%
child support so this is a good question
 
01:03:07.870 --> 01:03:07.880 align:start position:0%
for another day perhaps it a question
 
01:03:09.630 --> 01:03:09.640 align:start position:0%
for another day come up before
 
01:03:11.269 --> 01:03:11.279 align:start position:0%
representative bigford you had your hand
 
01:03:13.990 --> 01:03:14.000 align:start position:0%
up oh uh thank you Mr chairman I just
 
01:03:15.950 --> 01:03:15.960 align:start position:0%
want from the Supreme Court decision it
 
01:03:20.109 --> 01:03:20.119 align:start position:0%
does say this does however preclude a
 
01:03:22.990 --> 01:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
court from determining that a parent has
 
01:03:26.069 --> 01:03:26.079 align:start position:0%
remaining sources of income such that
 
01:03:30.150 --> 01:03:30.160 align:start position:0%
modification is unwarranted so that's so
 
01:03:32.630 --> 01:03:32.640 align:start position:0%
other income y can be applied but what
 
01:03:34.589 --> 01:03:34.599 align:start position:0%
we're looking at here is child support
 
01:03:36.789 --> 01:03:36.799 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
01:03:41.150 --> 01:03:41.160 align:start position:0%
generally uh set by earnings not your
 
01:03:43.309 --> 01:03:43.319 align:start position:0%
assets thank you uh but they can tap
 
01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
into them if they need it those assets
 
01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.029 align:start position:0%
into them if they need it those assets
anyone

01:03:48.029 --> 01:03:48.039 align:start position:0%
anyone
 
01:03:51.630 --> 01:03:51.640 align:start position:0%
else the motion before us is ought to
 
01:03:55.150 --> 01:03:55.160 align:start position:0%
pass on House Bill 1340 exclud inclusion
 
01:03:57.190 --> 01:03:57.200 align:start position:0%

01:06:18.870 --> 01:06:18.880 align:start position:0%

chair and committee members
 
01:06:26.470 --> 01:06:26.480 align:start position:0%
I'm not used to being on this side this
 
01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
is new for
 
01:06:31.230 --> 01:06:31.240 align:start position:0%
me scary my name no reminds me when I
 
01:06:34.710 --> 01:06:34.720 align:start position:0%
was a teacher so okay um my name is
 
01:06:38.670 --> 01:06:38.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:43.109 --> 01:06:43.119 align:start position:0%
Atkinson the purpose of
 
01:06:46.990 --> 01:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
h308 is to allow allow parents to know
 
01:06:50.069 --> 01:06:50.079 align:start position:0%
what library books their children have
 
01:06:52.670 --> 01:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
checked out at both public and school
 
01:06:55.589 --> 01:06:55.599 align:start position:0%
libraries any publicly funded libraries
 
01:06:58.029 --> 01:06:58.039 align:start position:0%
currently Library circulation records
 
01:07:00.670 --> 01:07:00.680 align:start position:0%
are considered confidential for all
 
01:07:03.230 --> 01:07:03.240 align:start position:0%
users so that includes
 
01:07:07.309 --> 01:07:07.319 align:start position:0%
minors as a public library employee
 
01:07:10.349 --> 01:07:10.359 align:start position:0%
myself I can attest to the fact that
 
01:07:12.950 --> 01:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
being unable to tell parents what books
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
their kids have checked out leads to
 
01:07:19.549 --> 01:07:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:23.069 --> 01:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
situations uh that is why I initially
 
01:07:25.630 --> 01:07:25.640 align:start position:0%
thought this bill would be a good
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
idea a lot of these situations involve
 
01:07:30.150 --> 01:07:30.160 align:start position:0%
overdue books I'm not going to get into
 
01:07:31.150 --> 01:07:31.160 align:start position:0%
a lot of
 
01:07:33.750 --> 01:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
anecdotal situations but just a few to
 
01:07:35.109 --> 01:07:35.119 align:start position:0%
give you an idea of what I have to go
 
01:07:36.470 --> 01:07:36.480 align:start position:0%
through each day at the front desk of
 
01:07:39.510 --> 01:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
the library I often have to tell parents
 
01:07:41.750 --> 01:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
that they're children owe fines because
 
01:07:42.750 --> 01:07:42.760 align:start position:0%
it's usually the parents who end up
 
01:07:46.190 --> 01:07:46.200 align:start position:0%
paying them but by law I cannot tell
 
01:07:48.670 --> 01:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
them what the fines are for even though
 
01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
as I just said they usually end up
 
01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:51.150 align:start position:0%
as I just said they usually end up
paying

01:07:51.150 --> 01:07:51.160 align:start position:0%
paying
 
01:07:54.029 --> 01:07:54.039 align:start position:0%
them then there was the time I had a pay
 
01:07:57.190 --> 01:07:57.200 align:start position:0%
Patron who was looking all over her
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
house for a library book that her child
 
01:08:02.230 --> 01:08:02.240 align:start position:0%
had misplaced but I couldn't tell her
 
01:08:04.349 --> 01:08:04.359 align:start position:0%
what the title was so she didn't even
 
01:08:07.349 --> 01:08:07.359 align:start position:0%
know what book she was looking for there
 
01:08:09.069 --> 01:08:09.079 align:start position:0%
was a kid who was listening to a long
 
01:08:11.750 --> 01:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
series of audio books and he lost track
 
01:08:14.269 --> 01:08:14.279 align:start position:0%
of which ones he had already listened to
 
01:08:16.430 --> 01:08:16.440 align:start position:0%
uh his mom just wanted to help he want
 
01:08:17.950 --> 01:08:17.960 align:start position:0%
she wanted to know which ones he had
 
01:08:19.990 --> 01:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
previously checked out but I couldn't
 
01:08:21.550 --> 01:08:21.560 align:start position:0%
even tell her
 
01:08:25.630 --> 01:08:25.640 align:start position:0%
that the parents for the most part react
 
01:08:28.910 --> 01:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
with disbelief in these situations and
 
01:08:30.749 --> 01:08:30.759 align:start position:0%
as I said I could go on and on with
 
01:08:33.550 --> 01:08:33.560 align:start position:0%
examples but this is not the only reason
 
01:08:35.070 --> 01:08:35.080 align:start position:0%
I'm putting the bill forward it was the
 
01:08:37.749 --> 01:08:37.759 align:start position:0%
initial impetus for the
 
01:08:40.510 --> 01:08:40.520 align:start position:0%
idea as we all know we live in a time
 
01:08:41.829 --> 01:08:41.839 align:start position:0%
when there is an increasing amount of
 
01:08:44.030 --> 01:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
concern over controversial materials
 
01:08:45.110 --> 01:08:45.120 align:start position:0%
kept in
 
01:08:47.829 --> 01:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
libraries a couple of weeks ago the
 
01:08:50.110 --> 01:08:50.120 align:start position:0%
house education committee which I serve
 
01:08:52.590 --> 01:08:52.600 align:start position:0%
on right over there across the hall
 
01:08:54.829 --> 01:08:54.839 align:start position:0%
heard testimony on hb1
 
01:08:57.990 --> 01:08:58.000 align:start position:0%
1419 a bill regarding the prohibition of
 
01:09:00.510 --> 01:09:00.520 align:start position:0%
obscene materials in school
 
01:09:03.709 --> 01:09:03.719 align:start position:0%
libraries one of the opponents of this
 
01:09:06.269 --> 01:09:06.279 align:start position:0%
bill in defending the continued
 
01:09:09.630 --> 01:09:09.640 align:start position:0%
inclusion of such material asserted I
 
01:09:12.590 --> 01:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
quote it's up to us as parents to know
 
01:09:14.110 --> 01:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
what our kids are
 
01:09:16.510 --> 01:09:16.520 align:start position:0%
reading although I disagreed with him on
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
the the bill he opposed and I support it
 
01:09:20.189 --> 01:09:20.199 align:start position:0%
that's a different Bill not the issue
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
today I completely agreed with this
 
01:09:24.349 --> 01:09:24.359 align:start position:0%
particular statement he made
 
01:09:27.669 --> 01:09:27.679 align:start position:0%
in a similar way last September Dr Nancy
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
pack the director of Alabama's Public
 
01:09:33.269 --> 01:09:33.279 align:start position:0%
Library System defended the library's
 
01:09:35.309 --> 01:09:35.319 align:start position:0%
collection development policies in a
 
01:09:38.110 --> 01:09:38.120 align:start position:0%
letter to Governor K Ivy and this is
 
01:09:40.510 --> 01:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
what she wrote Alabama's public
 
01:09:42.669 --> 01:09:42.679 align:start position:0%
libraries will always value parental
 
01:09:44.990 --> 01:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
involvement in overseeing the material
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
their children's borrow their children
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
borrow she later wrote that the
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility for determining the
 
01:09:55.030 --> 01:09:55.040 align:start position:0%
suitability of libr liary materials for
 
01:09:59.590 --> 01:09:59.600 align:start position:0%
children lies primarily with parents or
 
01:10:01.790 --> 01:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
Guardians although we might not see eye
 
01:10:03.910 --> 01:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
to eye on other issues I share Dr P's
 
01:10:06.550 --> 01:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
support again of the parents' role in
 
01:10:08.830 --> 01:10:08.840 align:start position:0%
guiding their children's reading
 
01:10:11.910 --> 01:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
selections to fulfill this role more
 
01:10:15.110 --> 01:10:15.120 align:start position:0%
effectively parents need to know what
 
01:10:17.390 --> 01:10:17.400 align:start position:0%
books their children have checked out
 
01:10:19.229 --> 01:10:19.239 align:start position:0%
and this is especially important in
 
01:10:21.070 --> 01:10:21.080 align:start position:0%
school libraries where parents are not
 
01:10:23.110 --> 01:10:23.120 align:start position:0%
usually present with their children as
 
01:10:25.910 --> 01:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
they often are in public
 
01:10:28.270 --> 01:10:28.280 align:start position:0%
libraries the New Hampshire library
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
trustees Association manual highlights I
 
01:10:33.750 --> 01:10:33.760 align:start position:0%
quote the responsibility and the rights
 
01:10:35.550 --> 01:10:35.560 align:start position:0%
of all parents and Guardians to guide
 
01:10:37.910 --> 01:10:37.920 align:start position:0%
their own children's use of the library
 
01:10:41.110 --> 01:10:41.120 align:start position:0%
and its resources and services my own
 
01:10:44.470 --> 01:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
public library in Atkinson asserts as
 
01:10:48.030 --> 01:10:48.040 align:start position:0%
many libraries do in their policies that
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
I quote again it is the responsibility
 
01:10:51.550 --> 01:10:51.560 align:start position:0%
of parents and Guardians to Monitor and
 
01:10:53.229 --> 01:10:53.239 align:start position:0%
improve the selection of materials made
 
01:10:55.070 --> 01:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
by children
 
01:10:58.470 --> 01:10:58.480 align:start position:0%
with such Universal affirmation of the
 
01:11:01.310 --> 01:11:01.320 align:start position:0%
need for Parental involvement on both
 
01:11:02.709 --> 01:11:02.719 align:start position:0%
sides with all these
 
01:11:05.189 --> 01:11:05.199 align:start position:0%
controversial issues involving books
 
01:11:07.830 --> 01:11:07.840 align:start position:0%
right now all I could find was Universal
 
01:11:10.470 --> 01:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
affirmation every organization
 
01:11:13.669 --> 01:11:13.679 align:start position:0%
saying that parents need to know they
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
need to be involved with their
 
01:11:14.719 --> 01:11:15.990 align:start position:0%
need to be involved with their
children's

01:11:15.990 --> 01:11:16.000 align:start position:0%
children's
 
01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.669 align:start position:0%
children's
reading

01:11:18.669 --> 01:11:18.679 align:start position:0%
reading
 
01:11:23.070 --> 01:11:23.080 align:start position:0%
activities so HB 1308 should not be
 
01:11:25.550 --> 01:11:25.560 align:start position:0%
controvers IAL at
 
01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:27.840 align:start position:0%
all in order for parents to be fully
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
involved in upholding their
 
01:11:31.110 --> 01:11:31.120 align:start position:0%
responsibility to monitor their
 
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
children's use of Library materials
 
01:11:35.229 --> 01:11:35.239 align:start position:0%
which everything I could find said this
 
01:11:37.510 --> 01:11:37.520 align:start position:0%
is a good thing they must have access to
 
01:11:39.790 --> 01:11:39.800 align:start position:0%
their kids Library
 
01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
records so the elephant in the room I
 
01:11:45.229 --> 01:11:45.239 align:start position:0%
know the primary objection to this bill
 
01:11:48.110 --> 01:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
will be that some children especially
 
01:11:50.910 --> 01:11:50.920 align:start position:0%
older children may not want their
 
01:11:54.030 --> 01:11:54.040 align:start position:0%
parents to know what books they are
 
01:11:56.390 --> 01:11:56.400 align:start position:0%
reading and I certainly appreciate the
 
01:11:58.750 --> 01:11:58.760 align:start position:0%
need for
 
01:12:03.590 --> 01:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
privacy but I don't think that privacy
 
01:12:06.510 --> 01:12:06.520 align:start position:0%
rights should extend to a person's use
 
01:12:06.520 --> 01:12:07.350 align:start position:0%
rights should extend to a person's use
of

01:12:07.350 --> 01:12:07.360 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
materials that have been paid for by
 
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
someone else and that's exactly what's
 
01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
going on here it's the parents who pay
 
01:12:16.390 --> 01:12:16.400 align:start position:0%
the taxes that pay for the books okay
 
01:12:17.709 --> 01:12:17.719 align:start position:0%
the minors they pray you know through
 
01:12:19.270 --> 01:12:19.280 align:start position:0%
their property
 
01:12:21.629 --> 01:12:21.639 align:start position:0%
taxes the children don't financially
 
01:12:24.390 --> 01:12:24.400 align:start position:0%
support the library
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
and there are alternatives If the child
 
01:12:30.149 --> 01:12:30.159 align:start position:0%
really doesn't want to know want the
 
01:12:32.350 --> 01:12:32.360 align:start position:0%
parent to know that they're reading
 
01:12:33.910 --> 01:12:33.920 align:start position:0%
something the parent you know might have
 
01:12:36.550 --> 01:12:36.560 align:start position:0%
some issues with well these this is
 
01:12:38.430 --> 01:12:38.440 align:start position:0%
normally older children older children
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
can get a job a paper route they can
 
01:12:41.270 --> 01:12:41.280 align:start position:0%
earn money they can go to the bookstore
 
01:12:43.350 --> 01:12:43.360 align:start position:0%
they can buy it on Amazon and if they
 
01:12:47.189 --> 01:12:47.199 align:start position:0%
can't do that they can go to the library
 
01:12:50.550 --> 01:12:50.560 align:start position:0%
and read whatever they want with nobody
 
01:12:53.910 --> 01:12:53.920 align:start position:0%
knowing they just can't check it out and
 
01:12:55.390 --> 01:12:55.400 align:start position:0%
like I said before the parents are the
 
01:12:57.229 --> 01:12:57.239 align:start position:0%
ones who ultimately even though there's
 
01:12:58.750 --> 01:12:58.760 align:start position:0%
no statute
 
01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
saying that they are responsible
 
01:13:03.910 --> 01:13:03.920 align:start position:0%
financially this is what ends up
 
01:13:05.510 --> 01:13:05.520 align:start position:0%
happening they end
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
up paying the overdue fines um and in
 
01:13:11.149 --> 01:13:11.159 align:start position:0%
the end they they're the ones paying for
 
01:13:14.510 --> 01:13:14.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:17.709 --> 01:13:17.719 align:start position:0%
taxes so um I'll I'll leave the rest for
 
01:13:19.070 --> 01:13:19.080 align:start position:0%
questions I have a lot of information
 
01:13:21.430 --> 01:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
here so but I want to address um but I I
 
01:13:23.470 --> 01:13:23.480 align:start position:0%
just want to end by saying that I ask
 
01:13:25.470 --> 01:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
you to help add New Hampshire to a
 
01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:27.080 align:start position:0%
growing number of states we would not be
 
01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:29.560 align:start position:0%
the first state to do this um that are
 
01:13:31.669 --> 01:13:31.679 align:start position:0%
supporting such Common Sense
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
legislation please pass HB 1308 not only
 
01:13:38.910 --> 01:13:38.920 align:start position:0%
to help facilitate Library operations
 
01:13:40.750 --> 01:13:40.760 align:start position:0%
but also to support parental involvement
 
01:13:43.470 --> 01:13:43.480 align:start position:0%
in children children's reading Pursuits
 
01:13:45.310 --> 01:13:45.320 align:start position:0%
and I just also want to make one note
 
01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:47.199 align:start position:0%
that a big supporter of this bill and a
 
01:13:49.990 --> 01:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
co-sponsor was representative Mike Drago
 
01:13:52.750 --> 01:13:52.760 align:start position:0%
from Raymond New Hampshire and he
 
01:13:54.430 --> 01:13:54.440 align:start position:0%
couldn't be here here today because of
 
01:13:56.229 --> 01:13:56.239 align:start position:0%
his business he's a landscaper he had to
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
go salt the weather and all um so I just
 
01:14:00.750 --> 01:14:00.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to let you know that he sent his
 
01:14:02.229 --> 01:14:02.239 align:start position:0%
testimony via email I'm not going to
 
01:14:03.390 --> 01:14:03.400 align:start position:0%
read it I thought at first then I've
 
01:14:05.910 --> 01:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
already taken enough of your time so
 
01:14:08.430 --> 01:14:08.440 align:start position:0%
please pay particular attention to that
 
01:14:10.590 --> 01:14:10.600 align:start position:0%
um testimony because he's the father of
 
01:14:12.709 --> 01:14:12.719 align:start position:0%
five children and he uses the library a
 
01:14:14.950 --> 01:14:14.960 align:start position:0%
lot and so I will be happy to take your
 
01:14:16.110 --> 01:14:16.120 align:start position:0%
questions and hopefully be able to
 
01:14:20.510 --> 01:14:20.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:22.790 --> 01:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
Petrino thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:14:25.870 --> 01:14:25.880 align:start position:0%
you represent for taking my question my
 
01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:29.600 align:start position:0%
my concern is um the library Gathering a
 
01:14:33.110 --> 01:14:33.120 align:start position:0%
database of all of these parents uh in
 
01:14:35.629 --> 01:14:35.639 align:start position:0%
advance and I'm particularly concerned
 
01:14:38.189 --> 01:14:38.199 align:start position:0%
with uh identifying parents who have
 
01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:40.880 align:start position:0%
custodial rights some you know as in
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
schools for example one parent has
 
01:14:45.189 --> 01:14:45.199 align:start position:0%
access to information other parents
 
01:14:48.310 --> 01:14:48.320 align:start position:0%
don't uh will libraries be able to have
 
01:14:51.229 --> 01:14:51.239 align:start position:0%
all of that information um will this
 
01:14:54.310 --> 01:14:54.320 align:start position:0%
incur uh extra cost and a burden on
 
01:14:58.070 --> 01:14:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:01.030 --> 01:15:01.040 align:start position:0%
things I can't think of any cost it
 
01:15:03.110 --> 01:15:03.120 align:start position:0%
would infer because I'm going from my
 
01:15:06.189 --> 01:15:06.199 align:start position:0%
own experience working in libraries I
 
01:15:07.470 --> 01:15:07.480 align:start position:0%
mean in a way it would make my job
 
01:15:09.669 --> 01:15:09.679 align:start position:0%
easier so
 
01:15:12.709 --> 01:15:12.719 align:start position:0%
um there would be that that I can think
 
01:15:13.990 --> 01:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
of no
 
01:15:16.830 --> 01:15:16.840 align:start position:0%
other negative financial
 
01:15:19.270 --> 01:15:19.280 align:start position:0%
burden follow
 
01:15:21.910 --> 01:15:21.920 align:start position:0%
up okay thank you I'd like to uh just
 
01:15:24.110 --> 01:15:24.120 align:start position:0%
restate my question I'm concerned about
 
01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
custodial uh rights that parents have
 
01:15:29.070 --> 01:15:29.080 align:start position:0%
for example when there's a divorce one
 
01:15:31.430 --> 01:15:31.440 align:start position:0%
parent may have access say to school
 
01:15:33.870 --> 01:15:33.880 align:start position:0%
records uh dad comes into the school and
 
01:15:35.189 --> 01:15:35.199 align:start position:0%
wants to know what's going on with their
 
01:15:37.149 --> 01:15:37.159 align:start position:0%
kid and the school is not obligated
 
01:15:38.669 --> 01:15:38.679 align:start position:0%
because that particular parent doesn't
 
01:15:42.709 --> 01:15:42.719 align:start position:0%
have the rights and so my concern is the
 
01:15:45.430 --> 01:15:45.440 align:start position:0%
custodial rights that individual parents
 
01:15:48.070 --> 01:15:48.080 align:start position:0%
have one parent may have legal rights to
 
01:15:50.910 --> 01:15:50.920 align:start position:0%
access information where others don't
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
and that really is the heart of my
 
01:15:54.229 --> 01:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
question how do we you know how does
 
01:15:56.310 --> 01:15:56.320 align:start position:0%
someone come into a library and say I'm
 
01:15:58.189 --> 01:15:58.199 align:start position:0%
the father of soand so and I want to
 
01:16:00.870 --> 01:16:00.880 align:start position:0%
know what my kid is looking at okay um
 
01:16:02.870 --> 01:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so if if a parent
 
01:16:04.669 --> 01:16:04.679 align:start position:0%
doesn't have custodial rights is there
 
01:16:09.790 --> 01:16:09.800 align:start position:0%
some concern that if that parent did
 
01:16:12.189 --> 01:16:12.199 align:start position:0%
obtain the information there might be a
 
01:16:15.229 --> 01:16:15.239 align:start position:0%
negative consequence to the the child no
 
01:16:16.790 --> 01:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
I believe there's some liability issues
 
01:16:18.590 --> 01:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
on the part of the library if the
 
01:16:20.669 --> 01:16:20.679 align:start position:0%
library discerns information that
 
01:16:23.350 --> 01:16:23.360 align:start position:0%
they're not uh allowed to give because
 
01:16:24.910 --> 01:16:24.920 align:start position:0%
that particular parent doesn't have the
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
right to have that information so here
 
01:16:29.229 --> 01:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
you have a librarian who is trying to
 
01:16:32.550 --> 01:16:32.560 align:start position:0%
decide you know am I legally obligated
 
01:16:34.110 --> 01:16:34.120 align:start position:0%
to give this particular parent
 
01:16:35.870 --> 01:16:35.880 align:start position:0%
information maybe I can give it to Mom
 
01:16:37.790 --> 01:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
but not to Dad and how would the
 
01:16:39.709 --> 01:16:39.719 align:start position:0%
librarian know that it would put the
 
01:16:41.950 --> 01:16:41.960 align:start position:0%
library I think in in a situation where
 
01:16:45.430 --> 01:16:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:48.590 --> 01:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
liability so I'm not a lawyer most of us
 
01:16:51.910 --> 01:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
reps aren't you bring up some good
 
01:16:54.189 --> 01:16:54.199 align:start position:0%
points but by bringing up this sort of
 
01:16:56.990 --> 01:16:57.000 align:start position:0%
situation though for me I I I thought
 
01:16:58.950 --> 01:16:58.960 align:start position:0%
one you know one of the objections to
 
01:17:00.750 --> 01:17:00.760 align:start position:0%
This was um something that does come up
 
01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
often in things that may be considered
 
01:17:07.709 --> 01:17:07.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:10.550 --> 01:17:10.560 align:start position:0%
May let's say the non-custodial
 
01:17:14.470 --> 01:17:14.480 align:start position:0%
parent um may not be happy with what
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
that parent sees the child is reading
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
and maybe even abuses them physically
 
01:17:22.390 --> 01:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
and my and I don't know if this goes to
 
01:17:23.470 --> 01:17:23.480 align:start position:0%
your question like I said I'm not a
 
01:17:24.790 --> 01:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
lawyer so some of these points you bring
 
01:17:26.669 --> 01:17:26.679 align:start position:0%
up about custodial you know it's a
 
01:17:30.510 --> 01:17:30.520 align:start position:0%
little Beyond me um uh but the intent of
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
the bill is all all good and not you
 
01:17:34.990 --> 01:17:35.000 align:start position:0%
know certainly not to
 
01:17:39.669 --> 01:17:39.679 align:start position:0%
um put children In Harm's Way um but you
 
01:17:43.709 --> 01:17:43.719 align:start position:0%
know one of the things um just as an
 
01:17:47.510 --> 01:17:47.520 align:start position:0%
analogy children get report
 
01:17:49.550 --> 01:17:49.560 align:start position:0%
cards maybe they get a bunch of D's and
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
an F you still send the report card
 
01:17:53.510 --> 01:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
home you know
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
with the argument of child safety it
 
01:17:57.590 --> 01:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
could be that you know well maybe we
 
01:17:58.870 --> 01:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't send the report cards home
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
because if they have a bad report card
 
01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:03.400 align:start position:0%
they the parent might beat the kid up I
 
01:18:05.030 --> 01:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
want to follow right up on what
 
01:18:07.390 --> 01:18:07.400 align:start position:0%
representative patrino said uh don't
 
01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:10.920 align:start position:0%
Librarians uh or Library Personnel have
 
01:18:12.550 --> 01:18:12.560 align:start position:0%
to know those
 
01:18:16.790 --> 01:18:16.800 align:start position:0%
cases when a child of tender age is
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to be picked up at the library and
 
01:18:23.270 --> 01:18:23.280 align:start position:0%
some parents some people do not have the
 
01:18:26.030 --> 01:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
right to pick up a child at the library
 
01:18:29.709 --> 01:18:29.719 align:start position:0%
or at the elementary school uh but so in
 
01:18:33.870 --> 01:18:33.880 align:start position:0%
a situation a family disruption
 
01:18:36.470 --> 01:18:36.480 align:start position:0%
situation wouldn't the library have to
 
01:18:39.390 --> 01:18:39.400 align:start position:0%
know that right now this parent is not
 
01:18:43.110 --> 01:18:43.120 align:start position:0%
allowed to pick up um Billy or Susie so
 
01:18:45.149 --> 01:18:45.159 align:start position:0%
it seems to me you're already doing some
 
01:18:47.669 --> 01:18:47.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:50.189 --> 01:18:50.199 align:start position:0%
things you know I speak from my
 
01:18:53.830 --> 01:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
experience so I brought this forward and
 
01:18:56.470 --> 01:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
um you're talking about issues that you
 
01:19:00.149 --> 01:19:00.159 align:start position:0%
know maybe different larger libraries
 
01:19:02.110 --> 01:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
you know I I know all these uh I know
 
01:19:04.870 --> 01:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
most of the parents who come in um and I
 
01:19:07.310 --> 01:19:07.320 align:start position:0%
I see your concerns and I I honestly you
 
01:19:09.470 --> 01:19:09.480 align:start position:0%
know don't know how thoroughly I can
 
01:19:12.390 --> 01:19:12.400 align:start position:0%
speak to your questions
 
01:19:14.990 --> 01:19:15.000 align:start position:0%
so I can look into it
 
01:19:17.750 --> 01:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
more if this is a big concern if there's
 
01:19:22.030 --> 01:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
some need for an amendment my point was
 
01:19:24.189 --> 01:19:24.199 align:start position:0%
isn't it more wor to find out which
 
01:19:26.229 --> 01:19:26.239 align:start position:0%
parent can get the list of the kids
 
01:19:28.790 --> 01:19:28.800 align:start position:0%
books checked out isn't it already a
 
01:19:31.070 --> 01:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
concern in many and I take your point
 
01:19:35.350 --> 01:19:35.360 align:start position:0%
larger Librarians libraries where uh
 
01:19:39.070 --> 01:19:39.080 align:start position:0%
picking up a kid at the library May
 
01:19:41.870 --> 01:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
involv the library staff in making sure
 
01:19:43.790 --> 01:19:43.800 align:start position:0%
they don't allow the kid to go off with
 
01:19:45.709 --> 01:19:45.719 align:start position:0%
the wrong well one of the things though
 
01:19:47.709 --> 01:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
that libraries encourage and a lot of
 
01:19:50.669 --> 01:19:50.679 align:start position:0%
the policies that I saw pertain to the
 
01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:53.800 align:start position:0%
fact that you you you need to to oversee
 
01:19:56.070 --> 01:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
your child you don't just you know this
 
01:19:57.430 --> 01:19:57.440 align:start position:0%
whole idea of like thinking like oh you
 
01:20:01.070 --> 01:20:01.080 align:start position:0%
just drop them off and and um the
 
01:20:02.430 --> 01:20:02.440 align:start position:0%
everything I kept reading was how
 
01:20:04.790 --> 01:20:04.800 align:start position:0%
they're like you should be involved and
 
01:20:07.350 --> 01:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
you know oversee the activities and it's
 
01:20:09.550 --> 01:20:09.560 align:start position:0%
not just like a drop off place so you
 
01:20:11.110 --> 01:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
can you know go have a break drop your
 
01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:15.320 align:start position:0%
kids off okay thank you representative
 
01:20:17.590 --> 01:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
Perez thank you Mr Sher and thank you
 
01:20:20.149 --> 01:20:20.159 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um more than a
 
01:20:24.070 --> 01:20:24.080 align:start position:0%
question is I'm a little concerned um as
 
01:20:27.910 --> 01:20:27.920 align:start position:0%
you know maybe some of you know um I'm a
 
01:20:31.070 --> 01:20:31.080 align:start position:0%
a survivor of sexual assult um from one
 
01:20:34.990 --> 01:20:35.000 align:start position:0%
of my parents from my from my dad and
 
01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:37.320 align:start position:0%
this is very concerning because my dad
 
01:20:39.790 --> 01:20:39.800 align:start position:0%
was a well-known
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
architect back in the days since he was
 
01:20:45.110 --> 01:20:45.120 align:start position:0%
a well-known they allow him to pick me
 
01:20:48.390 --> 01:20:48.400 align:start position:0%
up from the school from different
 
01:20:51.709 --> 01:20:51.719 align:start position:0%
areas even know that he was the
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
abuser my mom which she wasn't a
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
professional person was not allowing to
 
01:21:00.790 --> 01:21:00.800 align:start position:0%
have the same information is my dad who
 
01:21:03.149 --> 01:21:03.159 align:start position:0%
would he abuse it so I'm I'm very
 
01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:06.760 align:start position:0%
concerned um why would you tell of
 
01:21:09.870 --> 01:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
victims and survivors like myself that
 
01:21:12.350 --> 01:21:12.360 align:start position:0%
you know yes you want to give that
 
01:21:14.310 --> 01:21:14.320 align:start position:0%
information to parents but we need to be
 
01:21:14.320 --> 01:21:15.390 align:start position:0%
information to parents but we need to be
very

01:21:15.390 --> 01:21:15.400 align:start position:0%
very
 
01:21:18.310 --> 01:21:18.320 align:start position:0%
careful uh about what information or who
 
01:21:20.270 --> 01:21:20.280 align:start position:0%
is getting that information like I said
 
01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:22.120 align:start position:0%
you know as a Survivor I'm very
 
01:21:26.229 --> 01:21:26.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:28.990 --> 01:21:29.000 align:start position:0%
bill so it gets back to what I was
 
01:21:33.070 --> 01:21:33.080 align:start position:0%
saying before um that it your concern is
 
01:21:35.550 --> 01:21:35.560 align:start position:0%
safety the child's safety that's a big
 
01:21:38.830 --> 01:21:38.840 align:start position:0%
concern um now I bring up my analogy
 
01:21:41.030 --> 01:21:41.040 align:start position:0%
before about report cards just a
 
01:21:43.270 --> 01:21:43.280 align:start position:0%
question it custodi with custodial
 
01:21:45.229 --> 01:21:45.239 align:start position:0%
rights are they not allowed to see the
 
01:21:47.189 --> 01:21:47.199 align:start position:0%
child's report
 
01:21:47.199 --> 01:21:50.310 align:start position:0%
child's report
card

01:21:50.310 --> 01:21:50.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.790 --> 01:21:52.800 align:start position:0%
okay a question from another member
 
01:21:55.790 --> 01:21:55.800 align:start position:0%
representative Greg please thank you Mr
 
01:21:57.229 --> 01:21:57.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:21:59.629 --> 01:21:59.639 align:start position:0%
representative and presenting your bill
 
01:22:01.229 --> 01:22:01.239 align:start position:0%
you know I have one question I know that
 
01:22:03.149 --> 01:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
you've said a few times that one thing
 
01:22:04.590 --> 01:22:04.600 align:start position:0%
that you keep running into is the
 
01:22:06.629 --> 01:22:06.639 align:start position:0%
language that the responsibility for
 
01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:08.600 align:start position:0%
determining uh the suitability of
 
01:22:10.350 --> 01:22:10.360 align:start position:0%
material should be with the parents and
 
01:22:12.950 --> 01:22:12.960 align:start position:0%
stuff do you think that instead of
 
01:22:15.990 --> 01:22:16.000 align:start position:0%
intending for people to be reporting on
 
01:22:17.390 --> 01:22:17.400 align:start position:0%
the children that maybe they're
 
01:22:18.590 --> 01:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
intending that parents have
 
01:22:21.550 --> 01:22:21.560 align:start position:0%
conversations with their
 
01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.030 align:start position:0%
conversations with their
children

01:22:24.030 --> 01:22:24.040 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:22:26.229 --> 01:22:26.239 align:start position:0%
I I certainly believe that CH that
 
01:22:28.590 --> 01:22:28.600 align:start position:0%
parents should be having reading to
 
01:22:32.870 --> 01:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
their children um younger children um so
 
01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:34.760 align:start position:0%
I'm in agreement with that but what I
 
01:22:37.070 --> 01:22:37.080 align:start position:0%
have put forward is that there are just
 
01:22:39.270 --> 01:22:39.280 align:start position:0%
certain logistical situations I gave
 
01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
some examples
 
01:22:45.709 --> 01:22:45.719 align:start position:0%
um also it's you know let's say a child
 
01:22:47.950 --> 01:22:47.960 align:start position:0%
is or a parent comes into the library
 
01:22:49.870 --> 01:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
with a bunch of you know has a larger
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
family and representative Dro could have
 
01:22:54.510 --> 01:22:54.520 align:start position:0%
spoken to to this and it's sort of a
 
01:22:57.709 --> 01:22:57.719 align:start position:0%
chaotic environment and um you kind of
 
01:22:59.189 --> 01:22:59.199 align:start position:0%
can lose track children get their own
 
01:23:03.070 --> 01:23:03.080 align:start position:0%
library cards at the age of five um so
 
01:23:05.030 --> 01:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
uh you can lose track and it's important
 
01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:07.159 align:start position:0%
I think in order to have those
 
01:23:09.229 --> 01:23:09.239 align:start position:0%
conversations I think it's important to
 
01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
know what the books this the child has
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
out followup representative Greg as a
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
librarian are you not able to talk with
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
the child then and say the book that you
 
01:23:21.030 --> 01:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
are reading or the book that you have
 
01:23:24.510 --> 01:23:24.520 align:start position:0%
lost is barenstein bears go to Camp are
 
01:23:26.629 --> 01:23:26.639 align:start position:0%
you not able to tell the child that you
 
01:23:28.310 --> 01:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
said that you were not able to tell the
 
01:23:29.910 --> 01:23:29.920 align:start position:0%
parent right it's the parent who
 
01:23:31.350 --> 01:23:31.360 align:start position:0%
primarily is taking care and
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
facilitating on a daily basis I'm
 
01:23:36.030 --> 01:23:36.040 align:start position:0%
working with families and it's I I don't
 
01:23:38.750 --> 01:23:38.760 align:start position:0%
really engage with the individual the
 
01:23:40.950 --> 01:23:40.960 align:start position:0%
child sometimes is unable to you know
 
01:23:42.189 --> 01:23:42.199 align:start position:0%
sometimes the parents come in alone
 
01:23:44.270 --> 01:23:44.280 align:start position:0%
they're just returning books you know
 
01:23:46.350 --> 01:23:46.360 align:start position:0%
the child's not with them but to you
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
know engage in some sort of transaction
 
01:23:52.950 --> 01:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
with the child pertaining to Circular
 
01:23:58.510 --> 01:23:58.520 align:start position:0%
ulation uh issues seems um not realistic
 
01:24:01.229 --> 01:24:01.239 align:start position:0%
clarification representative
 
01:24:04.390 --> 01:24:04.400 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman um could you
 
01:24:08.590 --> 01:24:08.600 align:start position:0%
please explain to me when a library card
 
01:24:11.189 --> 01:24:11.199 align:start position:0%
is given to a minor
 
01:24:13.550 --> 01:24:13.560 align:start position:0%
um do the parents have to give
 
01:24:14.990 --> 01:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
permission for the child to have that
 
01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:17.360 align:start position:0%
library card many libraries do require
 
01:24:21.110 --> 01:24:21.120 align:start position:0%
that um mine mine does does not but
 
01:24:23.070 --> 01:24:23.080 align:start position:0%
usually there's a there's a parent
 
01:24:24.830 --> 01:24:24.840 align:start position:0%
the parent is with the child for the
 
01:24:27.070 --> 01:24:27.080 align:start position:0%
most part the child doesn't just come in
 
01:24:28.669 --> 01:24:28.679 align:start position:0%
and sign up for a library card the
 
01:24:31.830 --> 01:24:31.840 align:start position:0%
parent I need to use in fact the um I
 
01:24:33.629 --> 01:24:33.639 align:start position:0%
need to have the parents driver's
 
01:24:36.310 --> 01:24:36.320 align:start position:0%
license so I guess in a way that is the
 
01:24:38.430 --> 01:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
consent that I that I am using the
 
01:24:40.149 --> 01:24:40.159 align:start position:0%
parents driver's license to sign the
 
01:24:43.910 --> 01:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
child up for a library card follow
 
01:24:46.590 --> 01:24:46.600 align:start position:0%
follow up so that's my that's exactly my
 
01:24:49.950 --> 01:24:49.960 align:start position:0%
point so if you could just to confirm my
 
01:24:51.790 --> 01:24:51.800 align:start position:0%
understanding you do have to check with
 
01:24:53.310 --> 01:24:53.320 align:start position:0%
the parents so the parent has to give
 
01:24:55.350 --> 01:24:55.360 align:start position:0%
permission for the child to get the to
 
01:24:57.109 --> 01:24:57.119 align:start position:0%
have a library card because the child
 
01:24:58.750 --> 01:24:58.760 align:start position:0%
the parent is going to have to pay the
 
01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:01.440 align:start position:0%
fines so there the parent has that's the
 
01:25:02.510 --> 01:25:02.520 align:start position:0%
that's the understanding with the
 
01:25:04.950 --> 01:25:04.960 align:start position:0%
library sort of I did look into statute
 
01:25:07.109 --> 01:25:07.119 align:start position:0%
on the requirement to for the parent to
 
01:25:10.270 --> 01:25:10.280 align:start position:0%
pay fines and that's actually not in
 
01:25:12.870 --> 01:25:12.880 align:start position:0%
there but many Library policies do say I
 
01:25:15.390 --> 01:25:15.400 align:start position:0%
found a few very easily and if I dug
 
01:25:17.590 --> 01:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
deeper I would think there's many more
 
01:25:19.870 --> 01:25:19.880 align:start position:0%
libraries that specifically say that the
 
01:25:21.629 --> 01:25:21.639 align:start position:0%
parent is responsible for the library
 
01:25:21.639 --> 01:25:23.310 align:start position:0%
parent is responsible for the library
fines

01:25:23.310 --> 01:25:23.320 align:start position:0%
fines
 
01:25:25.189 --> 01:25:25.199 align:start position:0%
so they're part of the
 
01:25:27.310 --> 01:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
contract is BAS yeah in a sense I mean
 
01:25:29.870 --> 01:25:29.880 align:start position:0%
they have to give I cannot give a child
 
01:25:33.629 --> 01:25:33.639 align:start position:0%
a library card without seeing a parents
 
01:25:37.070 --> 01:25:37.080 align:start position:0%
driver's license and also usually
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
especially with the younger children who
 
01:25:40.189 --> 01:25:40.199 align:start position:0%
may not have a cell phone the phone
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
number on the account is the parents
 
01:25:43.590 --> 01:25:43.600 align:start position:0%
number this leads to some of those
 
01:25:45.750 --> 01:25:45.760 align:start position:0%
awkward situations where I call up and
 
01:25:47.790 --> 01:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
say something is terribly overdue and I
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
can't tell them what's overdue when the
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
parent answers I'm not going to and
 
01:25:52.430 --> 01:25:52.440 align:start position:0%
maybe to kind of go back to
 
01:25:53.550 --> 01:25:53.560 align:start position:0%
representative Greg's point it's not
 
01:25:55.950 --> 01:25:55.960 align:start position:0%
like I'm going to talk to the child on
 
01:25:57.510 --> 01:25:57.520 align:start position:0%
the phone you know maybe if it's a
 
01:25:59.390 --> 01:25:59.400 align:start position:0%
teenager sure your book's overdue you
 
01:26:02.270 --> 01:26:02.280 align:start position:0%
have a cell phone but not not uh younger
 
01:26:07.109 --> 01:26:07.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:11.229 --> 01:26:11.239 align:start position:0%
Representative giord no R I'm getting
 
01:26:15.229 --> 01:26:15.239 align:start position:0%
gford though you yes thank you sorry
 
01:26:18.270 --> 01:26:18.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um thank you for
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
coming before us and I didn't realize
 
01:26:23.510 --> 01:26:23.520 align:start position:0%
today I brought my re
 
01:26:28.030 --> 01:26:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:31.109 --> 01:26:31.119 align:start position:0%
overdue as my lunch bag so one of my
 
01:26:32.709 --> 01:26:32.719 align:start position:0%
concerns is the
 
01:26:37.109 --> 01:26:37.119 align:start position:0%
liability for the Librarians as well um
 
01:26:39.669 --> 01:26:39.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of the libraries libraries are
 
01:26:43.629 --> 01:26:43.639 align:start position:0%
our safe zones um and when we think
 
01:26:47.189 --> 01:26:47.199 align:start position:0%
about the kids the mo more vulnerable
 
01:26:51.189 --> 01:26:51.199 align:start position:0%
kids would you believe that Librarians
 
01:26:53.310 --> 01:26:53.320 align:start position:0%
don't have access access to those
 
01:26:56.750 --> 01:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
custodial agreements knowing which
 
01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:00.280 align:start position:0%
parent um Li libraries don't hold that
 
01:27:03.990 --> 01:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
information right now so we would be if
 
01:27:05.950 --> 01:27:05.960 align:start position:0%
if this were to pass we would have to
 
01:27:07.149 --> 01:27:07.159 align:start position:0%
create a
 
01:27:09.990 --> 01:27:10.000 align:start position:0%
mechanism to give Librarians that
 
01:27:13.070 --> 01:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
information that's very private so for
 
01:27:15.030 --> 01:27:15.040 align:start position:0%
example I actually have guardianship of
 
01:27:17.950 --> 01:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
my 19-year-old son so when I had to go
 
01:27:20.149 --> 01:27:20.159 align:start position:0%
to the library and present that legal
 
01:27:22.310 --> 01:27:22.320 align:start position:0%
information to them they did not have
 
01:27:25.590 --> 01:27:25.600 align:start position:0%
that information for my 19-year-old son
 
01:27:27.510 --> 01:27:27.520 align:start position:0%
that I have guardianship of so this
 
01:27:28.870 --> 01:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
would be a
 
01:27:31.790 --> 01:27:31.800 align:start position:0%
whole Vault of information that would
 
01:27:35.790 --> 01:27:35.800 align:start position:0%
need to be brought to libraries across
 
01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:37.550 align:start position:0%
need to be brought to libraries across
the

01:27:37.550 --> 01:27:37.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:27:41.310 --> 01:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
state what mechanism would that go
 
01:27:43.750 --> 01:27:43.760 align:start position:0%
through I cannot speak to that I'm not
 
01:27:45.189 --> 01:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
prepared to speak to that directly and
 
01:27:46.390 --> 01:27:46.400 align:start position:0%
you've bought up a couple of you who
 
01:27:47.910 --> 01:27:47.920 align:start position:0%
brought up this issue and I would
 
01:27:50.070 --> 01:27:50.080 align:start position:0%
certainly be willing to look into it
 
01:27:52.709 --> 01:27:52.719 align:start position:0%
more and um you know you know if there
 
01:27:55.950 --> 01:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
was some amendment that could address
 
01:27:59.510 --> 01:27:59.520 align:start position:0%
your concerns I would be very open to
 
01:27:59.520 --> 01:28:01.510 align:start position:0%
your concerns I would be very open to
that

01:28:01.510 --> 01:28:01.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:04.920 align:start position:0%
so representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
01:28:06.310 --> 01:28:06.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:28:09.830 --> 01:28:09.840 align:start position:0%
question um my question is about um line
 
01:28:13.629 --> 01:28:13.639 align:start position:0%
six on your um Bell it says such records
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
include but are not limited to library
 
01:28:19.430 --> 01:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
information system and archival Records
 
01:28:22.350 --> 01:28:22.360 align:start position:0%
um and so my question is kind of a
 
01:28:25.030 --> 01:28:25.040 align:start position:0%
follow-up to um representative balls you
 
01:28:27.750 --> 01:28:27.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you require a driver's
 
01:28:30.109 --> 01:28:30.119 align:start position:0%
license so what type of information is
 
01:28:33.550 --> 01:28:33.560 align:start position:0%
in your library system computer that a
 
01:28:36.350 --> 01:28:36.360 align:start position:0%
non-custodial or even a parent that has
 
01:28:39.030 --> 01:28:39.040 align:start position:0%
a um protective order preventing them
 
01:28:40.669 --> 01:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
from accessing the location of the other
 
01:28:42.510 --> 01:28:42.520 align:start position:0%
parent what kind of information is in
 
01:28:44.390 --> 01:28:44.400 align:start position:0%
the system that that this bill would
 
01:28:46.950 --> 01:28:46.960 align:start position:0%
authorize them to now have well there's
 
01:28:48.830 --> 01:28:48.840 align:start position:0%
just basic contact information when I
 
01:28:52.669 --> 01:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
sign someone up for a card and then
 
01:28:54.830 --> 01:28:54.840 align:start position:0%
every piece of material that gets
 
01:28:56.790 --> 01:28:56.800 align:start position:0%
checked in or out there's a record that
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
that transaction
 
01:29:00.870 --> 01:29:00.880 align:start position:0%
happened and those Rec I'm sorry follow
 
01:29:04.550 --> 01:29:04.560 align:start position:0%
up Mr thank you those records for a
 
01:29:07.229 --> 01:29:07.239 align:start position:0%
Minor's library card would be the
 
01:29:10.270 --> 01:29:10.280 align:start position:0%
custodial parents contact information
 
01:29:12.950 --> 01:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
correct yes okay thank
 
01:29:15.629 --> 01:29:15.639 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:29:18.030 --> 01:29:18.040 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:29:20.109 --> 01:29:20.119 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
01:29:22.030 --> 01:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
question and thank you for being a
 
01:29:25.430 --> 01:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
librarian it's an important job I really
 
01:29:29.830 --> 01:29:29.840 align:start position:0%
appreciate what you do um and I just
 
01:29:32.149 --> 01:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
01:29:34.870 --> 01:29:34.880 align:start position:0%
um um is
 
01:29:38.669 --> 01:29:38.679 align:start position:0%
it access to Children's Library records
 
01:29:42.550 --> 01:29:42.560 align:start position:0%
like the children's library or the
 
01:29:44.550 --> 01:29:44.560 align:start position:0%
records of the child what the just
 
01:29:47.189 --> 01:29:47.199 align:start position:0%
basically what the child has checked out
 
01:29:48.709 --> 01:29:48.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and may I please have one
 
01:29:51.950 --> 01:29:51.960 align:start position:0%
follow up um what age are we are we
 
01:29:54.669 --> 01:29:54.679 align:start position:0%
referring to here what age of child are
 
01:29:56.669 --> 01:29:56.679 align:start position:0%
we referring to is it that's covered by
 
01:29:59.390 --> 01:29:59.400 align:start position:0%
the bill um minor so up to
 
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
age 18 you know until age until age 18
 
01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.270 align:start position:0%
age 18 you know until age until age 18
thank

01:30:07.270 --> 01:30:07.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:10.109 --> 01:30:10.119 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
01:30:13.470 --> 01:30:13.480 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you for allowing me to take
 
01:30:16.990 --> 01:30:17.000 align:start position:0%
uh ask a question
 
01:30:19.669 --> 01:30:19.679 align:start position:0%
um our children have access to the
 
01:30:22.350 --> 01:30:22.360 align:start position:0%
internet and all I hear on the news is
 
01:30:25.790 --> 01:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
that monitor your child's internet
 
01:30:29.109 --> 01:30:29.119 align:start position:0%
access and what's being put out there in
 
01:30:32.310 --> 01:30:32.320 align:start position:0%
front of them and then I am hearing
 
01:30:34.229 --> 01:30:34.239 align:start position:0%
stories here with this bill being
 
01:30:37.030 --> 01:30:37.040 align:start position:0%
proposed that oh no we don't want the
 
01:30:39.390 --> 01:30:39.400 align:start position:0%
parents to have access it seems like
 
01:30:42.189 --> 01:30:42.199 align:start position:0%
we've got a a dichotomy going on over
 
01:30:44.550 --> 01:30:44.560 align:start position:0%
here and it's like should we be
 
01:30:48.270 --> 01:30:48.280 align:start position:0%
monitoring what our children are being
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
um exposed to on the internet
 
01:30:55.629 --> 01:30:55.639 align:start position:0%
and then we're not supposed to
 
01:30:58.390 --> 01:30:58.400 align:start position:0%
be monitoring what's going on in the
 
01:31:00.629 --> 01:31:00.639 align:start position:0%
libraries which is I I just can't see
 
01:31:03.870 --> 01:31:03.880 align:start position:0%
that as being two separate things and I
 
01:31:06.950 --> 01:31:06.960 align:start position:0%
think that this bill is addressing one
 
01:31:08.149 --> 01:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
of those
 
01:31:10.550 --> 01:31:10.560 align:start position:0%
issues and
 
01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
it's a way for parents to protect their
 
01:31:17.750 --> 01:31:17.760 align:start position:0%
children on what they want exposure to
 
01:31:20.430 --> 01:31:20.440 align:start position:0%
correct I agree with what you're saying
 
01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:31:25.149 --> 01:31:25.159 align:start position:0%
for the most part it protect I would
 
01:31:27.669 --> 01:31:27.679 align:start position:0%
bring this forward because it helps with
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
what you're saying um I I there's so
 
01:31:30.719 --> 01:31:31.910 align:start position:0%
what you're saying um I I there's so
many

01:31:31.910 --> 01:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
many
 
01:31:34.629 --> 01:31:34.639 align:start position:0%
um you know you bring up the internet
 
01:31:36.669 --> 01:31:36.679 align:start position:0%
and that's really hard to control
 
01:31:38.229 --> 01:31:38.239 align:start position:0%
because they can access it anywhere and
 
01:31:40.390 --> 01:31:40.400 align:start position:0%
on their phone and all um the library
 
01:31:43.149 --> 01:31:43.159 align:start position:0%
building is something that we can have
 
01:31:45.709 --> 01:31:45.719 align:start position:0%
more um control over
 
01:31:48.189 --> 01:31:48.199 align:start position:0%
so I really just have the best interest
 
01:31:50.430 --> 01:31:50.440 align:start position:0%
of the children in
 
01:31:53.189 --> 01:31:53.199 align:start position:0%
mind repres representative
 
01:31:55.669 --> 01:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
bigford uh thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:31:59.470 --> 01:31:59.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um now you in
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
uh line 12 you say parent or guardian of
 
01:32:04.629 --> 01:32:04.639 align:start position:0%
the minor but how would it work if that
 
01:32:08.030 --> 01:32:08.040 align:start position:0%
was stricken and you put in person the
 
01:32:10.229 --> 01:32:10.239 align:start position:0%
person's sponsoring the library card
 
01:32:12.070 --> 01:32:12.080 align:start position:0%
because as you pointed out earlier
 
01:32:13.590 --> 01:32:13.600 align:start position:0%
that's the person that's responsible for
 
01:32:15.310 --> 01:32:15.320 align:start position:0%
paying the debt it needs to be a parent
 
01:32:17.229 --> 01:32:17.239 align:start position:0%
or our Guardian
 
01:32:19.669 --> 01:32:19.679 align:start position:0%
though it needs to be you can't just
 
01:32:22.149 --> 01:32:22.159 align:start position:0%
have any adult it's a f you know family
 
01:32:24.310 --> 01:32:24.320 align:start position:0%
member it would be a parent of
 
01:32:28.229 --> 01:32:28.239 align:start position:0%
Guardian yes right yes so therefore it's
 
01:32:30.470 --> 01:32:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's there
 
01:32:32.669 --> 01:32:32.679 align:start position:0%
it's the person
 
01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:34.560 align:start position:0%
or because you've already got that
 
01:32:39.510 --> 01:32:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:42.270 --> 01:32:42.280 align:start position:0%
all that I mean that is basically the
 
01:32:44.709 --> 01:32:44.719 align:start position:0%
line that's being added um and it does
 
01:32:46.390 --> 01:32:46.400 align:start position:0%
reflect some of the language of what's
 
01:32:47.390 --> 01:32:47.400 align:start position:0%
in there
 
01:32:49.550 --> 01:32:49.560 align:start position:0%
already so I'm not sure how to answer
 
01:32:53.189 --> 01:32:53.199 align:start position:0%
your question can I try again yes uh
 
01:32:55.910 --> 01:32:55.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman as you pointed out
 
01:32:59.070 --> 01:32:59.080 align:start position:0%
the child gets a library card because a
 
01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:01.119 align:start position:0%
parent sponsors them
 
01:33:04.550 --> 01:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
right right I you could use that word
 
01:33:07.390 --> 01:33:07.400 align:start position:0%
sponsor um so that would be the person
 
01:33:10.510 --> 01:33:10.520 align:start position:0%
that should I would think uh the library
 
01:33:13.030 --> 01:33:13.040 align:start position:0%
should be responsible too because they
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
take a child takes books out doesn't
 
01:33:17.750 --> 01:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
return them you're going to expect that
 
01:33:22.070 --> 01:33:22.080 align:start position:0%
sponsor to pay the bill so and you don't
 
01:33:23.669 --> 01:33:23.679 align:start position:0%
need other parents involved then it's
 
01:33:25.910 --> 01:33:25.920 align:start position:0%
the one that gives the library card to
 
01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
so it's the one who initially right so I
 
01:33:29.990 --> 01:33:30.000 align:start position:0%
think in a way what you're saying kind
 
01:33:31.310 --> 01:33:31.320 align:start position:0%
of maybe anwers some of the other
 
01:33:33.629 --> 01:33:33.639 align:start position:0%
concerns about custodial thank you for
 
01:33:35.990 --> 01:33:36.000 align:start position:0%
for doing that because it does um
 
01:33:38.510 --> 01:33:38.520 align:start position:0%
address that then the person who comes
 
01:33:40.070 --> 01:33:40.080 align:start position:0%
in and then representative ball had
 
01:33:41.430 --> 01:33:41.440 align:start position:0%
asked questions about how do you get the
 
01:33:43.510 --> 01:33:43.520 align:start position:0%
library card and it's the custodial
 
01:33:45.070 --> 01:33:45.080 align:start position:0%
parent coming in with the driver's
 
01:33:48.629 --> 01:33:48.639 align:start position:0%
license so okay I hope that I hope then
 
01:33:50.590 --> 01:33:50.600 align:start position:0%
that clarifies some of the other
 
01:33:51.830 --> 01:33:51.840 align:start position:0%
questions that were asked that I feel
 
01:33:53.550 --> 01:33:53.560 align:start position:0%
like I didn't answer adequately only
 
01:33:55.870 --> 01:33:55.880 align:start position:0%
because I'm not a lawyer and so some of
 
01:33:59.189 --> 01:33:59.199 align:start position:0%
this uh language and and all is um not
 
01:34:01.709 --> 01:34:01.719 align:start position:0%
in my area of
 
01:34:05.629 --> 01:34:05.639 align:start position:0%
expertise representative Nelson hi thank
 
01:34:08.270 --> 01:34:08.280 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you for taking
 
01:34:14.669 --> 01:34:14.679 align:start position:0%
my um question um representative um do
 
01:34:19.430 --> 01:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
all um I and I'm sorry I'm I don't know
 
01:34:22.390 --> 01:34:22.400 align:start position:0%
this answer to this question um but
 
01:34:23.750 --> 01:34:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's why it's a question
 
01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
are I don't I don't excuse my ignorance
 
01:34:32.310 --> 01:34:32.320 align:start position:0%
um do libraries across the state utilize
 
01:34:36.669 --> 01:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
the same um system uh computer system oh
 
01:34:39.310 --> 01:34:39.320 align:start position:0%
no there's all different ones and so um
 
01:34:45.229 --> 01:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
what level of archival information do um
 
01:34:48.550 --> 01:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
like do certain libraries have more
 
01:34:50.830 --> 01:34:50.840 align:start position:0%
capability to access archival
 
01:34:53.430 --> 01:34:53.440 align:start position:0%
information than others or I'm just
 
01:34:56.470 --> 01:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
trying to wrap my head around
 
01:35:01.669 --> 01:35:01.679 align:start position:0%
um are we going to set ourselves up for
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
um some libraries to have to change
 
01:35:08.470 --> 01:35:08.480 align:start position:0%
their computer programs to you know okay
 
01:35:11.070 --> 01:35:11.080 align:start position:0%
I will admit I'm I'm have I'm not a
 
01:35:13.990 --> 01:35:14.000 align:start position:0%
career like lifelong librarian expert
 
01:35:15.629 --> 01:35:15.639 align:start position:0%
this is I was actually a teacher for
 
01:35:17.910 --> 01:35:17.920 align:start position:0%
many years and after covid I left that
 
01:35:21.149 --> 01:35:21.159 align:start position:0%
and I became just a a employee of a
 
01:35:23.189 --> 01:35:23.199 align:start position:0%
local public library assistant director
 
01:35:25.390 --> 01:35:25.400 align:start position:0%
working at the front desk so I'm not an
 
01:35:28.510 --> 01:35:28.520 align:start position:0%
expert and I feel like I'm not now I is
 
01:35:30.390 --> 01:35:30.400 align:start position:0%
the State Library hello I've met you
 
01:35:31.669 --> 01:35:31.679 align:start position:0%
before the state Li maybe the state
 
01:35:32.990 --> 01:35:33.000 align:start position:0%
librarian could I didn't know if he was
 
01:35:34.470 --> 01:35:34.480 align:start position:0%
going to speak but maybe he can answer
 
01:35:38.070 --> 01:35:38.080 align:start position:0%
some of your technical questions okay so
 
01:35:41.950 --> 01:35:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:44.149 --> 01:35:44.159 align:start position:0%
patrino thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:35:45.750 --> 01:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
you again representative for taking my
 
01:35:47.470 --> 01:35:47.480 align:start position:0%
question you did mention something in
 
01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:50.000 align:start position:0%
your testimony and I didn't quite pick
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
up on it so I just wanted to clarify
 
01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
ification what is the situation when um
 
01:35:59.830 --> 01:35:59.840 align:start position:0%
anyone enters a library and walks down
 
01:36:01.750 --> 01:36:01.760 align:start position:0%
uh and starts perusing the shelves to
 
01:36:04.030 --> 01:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
take a book off the shelf open it up and
 
01:36:06.870 --> 01:36:06.880 align:start position:0%
start reading something that maybe in
 
01:36:08.510 --> 01:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
this instance the child should not be
 
01:36:11.629 --> 01:36:11.639 align:start position:0%
looking at I mean how do we police that
 
01:36:13.590 --> 01:36:13.600 align:start position:0%
control that I mean a child can walk
 
01:36:16.070 --> 01:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
into a library and just take a book so
 
01:36:17.229 --> 01:36:17.239 align:start position:0%
what you're saying is that there's
 
01:36:20.070 --> 01:36:20.080 align:start position:0%
inappropriate material in libraries no
 
01:36:21.790 --> 01:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
what I'm saying no no what I'm saying is
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
what your concern is that there's
 
01:36:25.870 --> 01:36:25.880 align:start position:0%
inappropriate materials in the library
 
01:36:28.070 --> 01:36:28.080 align:start position:0%
that CH should not have access to is
 
01:36:30.870 --> 01:36:30.880 align:start position:0%
what I'm hearing so my concern is if
 
01:36:33.430 --> 01:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
that's the case how do we prevent
 
01:36:35.750 --> 01:36:35.760 align:start position:0%
children from accessing what you refer
 
01:36:38.189 --> 01:36:38.199 align:start position:0%
to as inappropriate material by simply
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
just walking in after school walking
 
01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
down the shelves taking a book down and
 
01:36:44.510 --> 01:36:44.520 align:start position:0%
standing in the aisle for about 10
 
01:36:45.709 --> 01:36:45.719 align:start position:0%
minutes just kind of flipping through
 
01:36:47.669 --> 01:36:47.679 align:start position:0%
the pages not even taking the book out
 
01:36:49.790 --> 01:36:49.800 align:start position:0%
how do we how do we prevent that and
 
01:36:51.270 --> 01:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
because you did make reference to that I
 
01:36:52.790 --> 01:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
thinking your testimony and they didn't
 
01:36:54.750 --> 01:36:54.760 align:start position:0%
quite pick up on the oh um I think what
 
01:36:56.950 --> 01:36:56.960 align:start position:0%
I was saying was that if older
 
01:36:59.070 --> 01:36:59.080 align:start position:0%
children didn't want their parents to
 
01:37:01.270 --> 01:37:01.280 align:start position:0%
know what books they're reading they
 
01:37:05.030 --> 01:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
they can go into the library and just
 
01:37:06.430 --> 01:37:06.440 align:start position:0%
not check them out the minute they check
 
01:37:09.790 --> 01:37:09.800 align:start position:0%
the book out my contention is that the
 
01:37:12.590 --> 01:37:12.600 align:start position:0%
the sponsoring parent who is you know
 
01:37:15.350 --> 01:37:15.360 align:start position:0%
with the library the driver's license um
 
01:37:16.950 --> 01:37:16.960 align:start position:0%
they're the property owner they're
 
01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
paying the taxes that buy the books so
 
01:37:20.990 --> 01:37:21.000 align:start position:0%
they should be able to know what books
 
01:37:23.950 --> 01:37:23.960 align:start position:0%
the child takes out so
 
01:37:26.629 --> 01:37:26.639 align:start position:0%
um the child if the child doesn't take a
 
01:37:26.639 --> 01:37:27.470 align:start position:0%
um the child if the child doesn't take a
book

01:37:27.470 --> 01:37:27.480 align:start position:0%
book
 
01:37:31.270 --> 01:37:31.280 align:start position:0%
out and remains in the library they have
 
01:37:34.430 --> 01:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
privacy they um but what concerns me
 
01:37:36.109 --> 01:37:36.119 align:start position:0%
more is your question because you use
 
01:37:36.990 --> 01:37:37.000 align:start position:0%
this term
 
01:37:39.830 --> 01:37:39.840 align:start position:0%
inappropriate and I think that is a term
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
that needs to be defined by the parent
 
01:37:44.629 --> 01:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
maybe that you know we have so much
 
01:37:46.270 --> 01:37:46.280 align:start position:0%
controversy now about inappropriate
 
01:37:49.470 --> 01:37:49.480 align:start position:0%
materials and um I think both sides can
 
01:37:51.950 --> 01:37:51.960 align:start position:0%
agree I read all that stuff about how
 
01:37:54.149 --> 01:37:54.159 align:start position:0%
both sides were saying parents need to
 
01:37:56.310 --> 01:37:56.320 align:start position:0%
be involved parents need to be involved
 
01:37:59.149 --> 01:37:59.159 align:start position:0%
so um the parents are the ones that
 
01:38:01.390 --> 01:38:01.400 align:start position:0%
should then be defining for their child
 
01:38:03.589 --> 01:38:03.599 align:start position:0%
what they think is
 
01:38:05.790 --> 01:38:05.800 align:start position:0%
appropriate do you want to follow up
 
01:38:07.390 --> 01:38:07.400 align:start position:0%
follow up than you yeah just for
 
01:38:09.910 --> 01:38:09.920 align:start position:0%
clarification inappropriate material I
 
01:38:11.830 --> 01:38:11.840 align:start position:0%
believe is what you had testified to so
 
01:38:14.470 --> 01:38:14.480 align:start position:0%
I was basically using your concern not
 
01:38:18.070 --> 01:38:18.080 align:start position:0%
my concern okay mising some people think
 
01:38:19.870 --> 01:38:19.880 align:start position:0%
things are inappropriate for the
 
01:38:21.830 --> 01:38:21.840 align:start position:0%
purposes of this bill we're discussing
 
01:38:24.550 --> 01:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
right here I think it should be that the
 
01:38:26.910 --> 01:38:26.920 align:start position:0%
whole point is that the parents need to
 
01:38:30.830 --> 01:38:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:34.149 --> 01:38:34.159 align:start position:0%
be you know guiding their children in
 
01:38:35.990 --> 01:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
what they think is
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
appropriate any other
 
01:38:41.709 --> 01:38:41.719 align:start position:0%
questions thank you for your testimony
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
and uh given the I'm
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
sorry representative sidel you are back
 
01:38:53.390 --> 01:38:53.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:55.950 --> 01:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
okay thank you Mr chairman thank you for
 
01:38:59.950 --> 01:38:59.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question um in going along
 
01:39:01.990 --> 01:39:02.000 align:start position:0%
with representative Bickford's um
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
comment on line 12 would you be at all
 
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
interested in being able to amend that
 
01:39:10.950 --> 01:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
line to make it so that it's just the
 
01:39:13.430 --> 01:39:13.440 align:start position:0%
parent that gives and in so doing to
 
01:39:15.790 --> 01:39:15.800 align:start position:0%
address the concerns that to me seem to
 
01:39:18.430 --> 01:39:18.440 align:start position:0%
be the main stumbling block a little bit
 
01:39:20.070 --> 01:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
for some of you if there was some sort
 
01:39:24.750 --> 01:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
of way to clarify that sure that sounds
 
01:39:28.709 --> 01:39:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.109 --> 01:39:31.119 align:start position:0%
idea thank you for your
 
01:39:33.550 --> 01:39:33.560 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you all the education
 
01:39:35.189 --> 01:39:35.199 align:start position:0%
committee is probably probably wondering
 
01:39:38.390 --> 01:39:38.400 align:start position:0%
where the heck I am because we're in I
 
01:39:39.830 --> 01:39:39.840 align:start position:0%
was like I just had to step out for a
 
01:39:42.229 --> 01:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
minute all right we are going to now
 
01:39:46.310 --> 01:39:46.320 align:start position:0%
move into the 4minute drill and that is
 
01:39:48.470 --> 01:39:48.480 align:start position:0%
not uncommon in most committees and it
 
01:39:51.830 --> 01:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
is enforced uh make your point in in 4
 
01:39:53.790 --> 01:39:53.800 align:start position:0%
minutes no longer or you'll lose your
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
mic and then that will give an
 
01:39:58.550 --> 01:39:58.560 align:start position:0%
opportunity for a few questions and that
 
01:40:01.589 --> 01:40:01.599 align:start position:0%
should actually pushes past 12 noon
 
01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
chair next recognizes I think this is um
 
01:40:07.589 --> 01:40:07.599 align:start position:0%
is it Renee
 
01:40:11.229 --> 01:40:11.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:15.080 align:start position:0%
up and your first test at sitting at the
 
01:40:18.189 --> 01:40:18.199 align:start position:0%
witness table
 
01:40:21.790 --> 01:40:21.800 align:start position:0%
is no that's the second one
 
01:40:25.589 --> 01:40:25.599 align:start position:0%
yeah well done it it's red I don't feel
 
01:40:27.270 --> 01:40:27.280 align:start position:0%
self-righteous about that because I went
 
01:40:29.229 --> 01:40:29.239 align:start position:0%
to testify in another committee and I
 
01:40:31.310 --> 01:40:31.320 align:start position:0%
forgot to turn it on to uh this is the
 
01:40:32.430 --> 01:40:32.440 align:start position:0%
first time I've had to come up and
 
01:40:35.470 --> 01:40:35.480 align:start position:0%
testify so I'm I'm a newbie um my name
 
01:40:37.310 --> 01:40:37.320 align:start position:0%
is Renee Mallet I live in Windom New
 
01:40:41.390 --> 01:40:41.400 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am a former Library trustee
 
01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:43.080 align:start position:0%
a currently on the board of directors
 
01:40:45.790 --> 01:40:45.800 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire library trustee
 
01:40:49.030 --> 01:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
Association and I am also the parent of
 
01:40:50.589 --> 01:40:50.599 align:start position:0%
five children which Apparently one of
 
01:40:55.270 --> 01:40:55.280 align:start position:0%
the co co-sponsors is um a lot of you
 
01:40:56.990 --> 01:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
asked questions that were kind of at the
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
heart of what I wanted to testify
 
01:41:02.990 --> 01:41:03.000 align:start position:0%
to um you know sorry I take a lot of
 
01:41:05.149 --> 01:41:05.159 align:start position:0%
notes going back to sort of the the
 
01:41:07.030 --> 01:41:07.040 align:start position:0%
beginning when we you know when the
 
01:41:09.390 --> 01:41:09.400 align:start position:0%
representative was reading sort of these
 
01:41:10.629 --> 01:41:10.639 align:start position:0%
things about how parents should be
 
01:41:13.390 --> 01:41:13.400 align:start position:0%
involved with their kids and um a lot of
 
01:41:16.270 --> 01:41:16.280 align:start position:0%
that language actually comes from what
 
01:41:18.270 --> 01:41:18.280 align:start position:0%
in library world we call the unintended
 
01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:22.040 align:start position:0%
children policy um I can't speak for her
 
01:41:23.790 --> 01:41:23.800 align:start position:0%
library but most of the libraries in the
 
01:41:25.950 --> 01:41:25.960 align:start position:0%
state do not allow unattended children
 
01:41:28.709 --> 01:41:28.719 align:start position:0%
in the library so it's not just a matter
 
01:41:31.229 --> 01:41:31.239 align:start position:0%
of the parent has to be there to sign
 
01:41:33.270 --> 01:41:33.280 align:start position:0%
the child up for a library card the
 
01:41:35.229 --> 01:41:35.239 align:start position:0%
parents are expected to be with the
 
01:41:37.109 --> 01:41:37.119 align:start position:0%
children and be involved with the
 
01:41:39.790 --> 01:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
children while they're at the library it
 
01:41:41.830 --> 01:41:41.840 align:start position:0%
is not a place where you're supposed to
 
01:41:44.070 --> 01:41:44.080 align:start position:0%
drop your kid off and come in later and
 
01:41:45.510 --> 01:41:45.520 align:start position:0%
say hey what were they doing what were
 
01:41:48.510 --> 01:41:48.520 align:start position:0%
they reading
 
01:41:51.629 --> 01:41:51.639 align:start position:0%
um these policies can vary in libraries
 
01:41:54.910 --> 01:41:54.920 align:start position:0%
across the state um I live in Windam and
 
01:41:57.990 --> 01:41:58.000 align:start position:0%
our policy is pretty typical I think for
 
01:42:00.589 --> 01:42:00.599 align:start position:0%
most libraries uh Windam actually does
 
01:42:02.350 --> 01:42:02.360 align:start position:0%
not allow children under 11 in the
 
01:42:04.350 --> 01:42:04.360 align:start position:0%
library at all without a parent and
 
01:42:06.589 --> 01:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
again that parent is expected to be
 
01:42:08.189 --> 01:42:08.199 align:start position:0%
involved with the child they're not
 
01:42:10.270 --> 01:42:10.280 align:start position:0%
supposed to you know go look at their
 
01:42:12.510 --> 01:42:12.520 align:start position:0%
own books and the kid wanders around and
 
01:42:16.589 --> 01:42:16.599 align:start position:0%
is doing anything um as we've said you
 
01:42:18.430 --> 01:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
know parents have to sign their children
 
01:42:21.390 --> 01:42:21.400 align:start position:0%
up for a library card um in Windom
 
01:42:24.950 --> 01:42:24.960 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 11 and 14 kids are
 
01:42:26.870 --> 01:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
still only expected to only spend about
 
01:42:30.589 --> 01:42:30.599 align:start position:0%
an hour alone in the library um so at
 
01:42:32.310 --> 01:42:32.320 align:start position:0%
that point we're starting to talk about
 
01:42:34.830 --> 01:42:34.840 align:start position:0%
kids you know Windom like many New
 
01:42:37.070 --> 01:42:37.080 align:start position:0%
Hampshire towns is not walkable um I'm
 
01:42:39.149 --> 01:42:39.159 align:start position:0%
an adult I couldn't walk to our library
 
01:42:41.229 --> 01:42:41.239 align:start position:0%
sadly I wish we had sidewalks and could
 
01:42:45.270 --> 01:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
I would love it um so in order to for a
 
01:42:47.750 --> 01:42:47.760 align:start position:0%
kid to even get to the library a parent
 
01:42:50.189 --> 01:42:50.199 align:start position:0%
or someone has to be bringing them there
 
01:42:51.629 --> 01:42:51.639 align:start position:0%
or they have to be old enough to have a
 
01:42:53.990 --> 01:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
driver's license and a car and go
 
01:42:56.910 --> 01:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
themselves um and for me especially as a
 
01:42:59.430 --> 01:42:59.440 align:start position:0%
parent with five kids this comes
 
01:43:02.149 --> 01:43:02.159 align:start position:0%
down it is not a parental right issue
 
01:43:04.390 --> 01:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
it's a parental responsibility issue we
 
01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
should know our kids if we don't trust
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
our kids to follow our family values or
 
01:43:11.189 --> 01:43:11.199 align:start position:0%
expectations why would we give them a
 
01:43:13.189 --> 01:43:13.199 align:start position:0%
car and a driver's license and let them
 
01:43:16.189 --> 01:43:16.199 align:start position:0%
go wherever they want and you know and
 
01:43:17.950 --> 01:43:17.960 align:start position:0%
and I think it is important to say you
 
01:43:21.030 --> 01:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
know uh being from a big family I know
 
01:43:22.910 --> 01:43:22.920 align:start position:0%
one of the representatives arguments was
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
you know it's it's harder if you have a
 
01:43:25.629 --> 01:43:25.639 align:start position:0%
big family to keep track of what
 
01:43:28.790 --> 01:43:28.800 align:start position:0%
everybody's reading and doing and um I
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
don't know I talking about what we're
 
01:43:32.790 --> 01:43:32.800 align:start position:0%
reading and the media we're accessing
 
01:43:35.470 --> 01:43:35.480 align:start position:0%
for us is a family thing we sit at the
 
01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:37.119 align:start position:0%
dinner table and we talk about what
 
01:43:39.550 --> 01:43:39.560 align:start position:0%
we're reading and you know what we've
 
01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:42.159 align:start position:0%
done with our day so I I certainly for
 
01:43:43.950 --> 01:43:43.960 align:start position:0%
myself do not
 
01:43:46.669 --> 01:43:46.679 align:start position:0%
find number of kids
 
01:43:50.310 --> 01:43:50.320 align:start position:0%
detriment um I did just want to say I I
 
01:43:52.550 --> 01:43:52.560 align:start position:0%
appr appreciated the comment that maybe
 
01:43:54.189 --> 01:43:54.199 align:start position:0%
this could be amended in a way to make
 
01:43:56.189 --> 01:43:56.199 align:start position:0%
it safer for children but I did want to
 
01:43:58.470 --> 01:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
say that just because somebody is a
 
01:44:00.629 --> 01:44:00.639 align:start position:0%
parent and signs their kid up for a
 
01:44:02.990 --> 01:44:03.000 align:start position:0%
library card does not mean that later on
 
01:44:05.910 --> 01:44:05.920 align:start position:0%
there couldn't be a family disruption
 
01:44:08.589 --> 01:44:08.599 align:start position:0%
situation custody can change parent
 
01:44:11.070 --> 01:44:11.080 align:start position:0%
rights can change you're putting a big
 
01:44:13.950 --> 01:44:13.960 align:start position:0%
onus on the taxpayers and on Library
 
01:44:16.189 --> 01:44:16.199 align:start position:0%
employees to keep track of legal matters
 
01:44:18.390 --> 01:44:18.400 align:start position:0%
and and frankly I think it's a burden
 
01:44:20.229 --> 01:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
for residents in New Hampshire if you're
 
01:44:21.149 --> 01:44:21.159 align:start position:0%
going through through a family
 
01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:23.000 align:start position:0%
disruption situation if you're getting a
 
01:44:25.470 --> 01:44:25.480 align:start position:0%
divorce if you're you know have domestic
 
01:44:26.750 --> 01:44:26.760 align:start position:0%
violence the last thing you want to
 
01:44:28.790 --> 01:44:28.800 align:start position:0%
think about is oh and now I've got to go
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
update my kids library card
 
01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:35.679 align:start position:0%
um I just think that ultimately I think
 
01:44:38.270 --> 01:44:38.280 align:start position:0%
this does cost it costs our libraries in
 
01:44:40.470 --> 01:44:40.480 align:start position:0%
towns for legal liabilities libraries
 
01:44:43.750 --> 01:44:43.760 align:start position:0%
will have to update their systems to
 
01:44:46.830 --> 01:44:46.840 align:start position:0%
keep track of records and custody and I
 
01:44:49.070 --> 01:44:49.080 align:start position:0%
I thank you thank you for your testimony
 
01:44:50.189 --> 01:44:50.199 align:start position:0%
I do have a question for you if you'll
 
01:44:51.430 --> 01:44:51.440 align:start position:0%
take one
 
01:44:55.709 --> 01:44:55.719 align:start position:0%
um you said I think I heard you say no
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
unintended children allowed in the
 
01:45:00.750 --> 01:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
library is that up to age 11 or is that
 
01:45:03.109 --> 01:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
Beyond like I said it can vary by
 
01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:06.560 align:start position:0%
Library um in the town I live in it's
 
01:45:10.790 --> 01:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
under 11 parents have to be there so on
 
01:45:12.550 --> 01:45:12.560 align:start position:0%
the surface that could mean therefore
 
01:45:14.790 --> 01:45:14.800 align:start position:0%
the parents are already there watching
 
01:45:17.350 --> 01:45:17.360 align:start position:0%
what kid books the kids want to take out
 
01:45:20.910 --> 01:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't demand that you ID people
 
01:45:23.709 --> 01:45:23.719 align:start position:0%
to make sure the person the adult
 
01:45:26.470 --> 01:45:26.480 align:start position:0%
tending to the child is in fact a parent
 
01:45:27.950 --> 01:45:27.960 align:start position:0%
it could be a teacher it could be a
 
01:45:30.790 --> 01:45:30.800 align:start position:0%
coach it could be an advocate and so
 
01:45:32.709 --> 01:45:32.719 align:start position:0%
that child could walk out of the library
 
01:45:34.270 --> 01:45:34.280 align:start position:0%
with various things and the parent
 
01:45:35.750 --> 01:45:35.760 align:start position:0%
doesn't know it even though the child is
 
01:45:39.350 --> 01:45:39.360 align:start position:0%
tender aged um I know from my
 
01:45:42.430 --> 01:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
familiarity with our unattended children
 
01:45:44.350 --> 01:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
policy is that it does say specifically
 
01:45:46.629 --> 01:45:46.639 align:start position:0%
that a parent or Guardian is expected to
 
01:45:50.950 --> 01:45:50.960 align:start position:0%
be with the child um no know it's not
 
01:45:53.149 --> 01:45:53.159 align:start position:0%
policed um again because our Librarians
 
01:45:55.310 --> 01:45:55.320 align:start position:0%
have no mechanism in place in order to
 
01:45:58.430 --> 01:45:58.440 align:start position:0%
track that sort of information um but
 
01:46:00.350 --> 01:46:00.360 align:start position:0%
ours says actually quite specifically I
 
01:46:02.350 --> 01:46:02.360 align:start position:0%
think it might even be bolded the
 
01:46:04.430 --> 01:46:04.440 align:start position:0%
library is not acting in the place of
 
01:46:06.870 --> 01:46:06.880 align:start position:0%
the parent a parent or Guardian is
 
01:46:09.910 --> 01:46:09.920 align:start position:0%
expected to be with the children okay
 
01:46:12.229 --> 01:46:12.239 align:start position:0%
thank you other
 
01:46:14.750 --> 01:46:14.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you hey for
 
01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:16.760 align:start position:0%
a rookie you did
 
01:46:19.229 --> 01:46:19.239 align:start position:0%
good and look that she turned it off
 
01:46:23.229 --> 01:46:23.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.229 --> 01:46:28.239 align:start position:0%
the chair next recognizes Karen ISB ISB
 
01:46:36.870 --> 01:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:40.189 --> 01:46:40.199 align:start position:0%
right but you found the button yeah push
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
the button um my name is Karen islab I
 
01:46:45.109 --> 01:46:45.119 align:start position:0%
am the head of Youth Services for the
 
01:46:48.470 --> 01:46:48.480 align:start position:0%
Manchester City library and I am
 
01:46:50.990 --> 01:46:51.000 align:start position:0%
concerned about one word in the um well
 
01:46:53.709 --> 01:46:53.719 align:start position:0%
more concerned about the impact of the
 
01:46:56.750 --> 01:46:56.760 align:start position:0%
what the word Services is now does that
 
01:47:01.430 --> 01:47:01.440 align:start position:0%
mean that we have to as Librarians when
 
01:47:04.310 --> 01:47:04.320 align:start position:0%
the kids come to programs do we have to
 
01:47:05.990 --> 01:47:06.000 align:start position:0%
make we have to write down every little
 
01:47:08.750 --> 01:47:08.760 align:start position:0%
thing that they do because that is going
 
01:47:12.830 --> 01:47:12.840 align:start position:0%
to take so much time um I'm going to
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit very quick um
 
01:47:17.910 --> 01:47:17.920 align:start position:0%
summary of how many programs we do once
 
01:47:20.550 --> 01:47:20.560 align:start position:0%
a month or monthly programs at the
 
01:47:23.149 --> 01:47:23.159 align:start position:0%
Library our library our two buildings we
 
01:47:26.470 --> 01:47:26.480 align:start position:0%
do three story times a week so that is
 
01:47:29.390 --> 01:47:29.400 align:start position:0%
for four weeks that's 12 story times we
 
01:47:32.910 --> 01:47:32.920 align:start position:0%
do two other monthly story times well
 
01:47:37.149 --> 01:47:37.159 align:start position:0%
the story times for our P um attendance
 
01:47:39.950 --> 01:47:39.960 align:start position:0%
is about 50 to 60
 
01:47:42.910 --> 01:47:42.920 align:start position:0%
kids I can't run around after 5 year
 
01:47:46.990 --> 01:47:47.000 align:start position:0%
olds for all all 50 60 kids monthly um
 
01:47:49.709 --> 01:47:49.719 align:start position:0%
story times that's average is about 30 a
 
01:47:49.719 --> 01:47:50.830 align:start position:0%
story times that's average is about 30 a
month

01:47:50.830 --> 01:47:50.840 align:start position:0%
month
 
01:47:53.510 --> 01:47:53.520 align:start position:0%
two Elementary experiments stem programs
 
01:47:57.430 --> 01:47:57.440 align:start position:0%
that averages 30 to 40 kids a month one
 
01:47:59.750 --> 01:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
special toddler program that can go
 
01:48:02.550 --> 01:48:02.560 align:start position:0%
anywhere from 60 to 80
 
01:48:06.790 --> 01:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
people um one legal program 30 to 50
 
01:48:09.750 --> 01:48:09.760 align:start position:0%
kids weekly teen
 
01:48:15.189 --> 01:48:15.199 align:start position:0%
programs at both buildings maybe 15 20
 
01:48:18.830 --> 01:48:18.840 align:start position:0%
25 um two monthly
 
01:48:21.390 --> 01:48:21.400 align:start position:0%
um movie
 
01:48:24.109 --> 01:48:24.119 align:start position:0%
maybe 10 12 15
 
01:48:27.310 --> 01:48:27.320 align:start position:0%
kids and this is a and I'm also
 
01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:29.880 align:start position:0%
look thinking about once they leave the
 
01:48:32.070 --> 01:48:32.080 align:start position:0%
program do we have to follow them and
 
01:48:33.910 --> 01:48:33.920 align:start position:0%
say oh this child played with a PL toy
 
01:48:38.030 --> 01:48:38.040 align:start position:0%
this one did this um we also have two
 
01:48:40.270 --> 01:48:40.280 align:start position:0%
wial reading programs going on which
 
01:48:42.790 --> 01:48:42.800 align:start position:0%
have six different passive programs that
 
01:48:44.990 --> 01:48:45.000 align:start position:0%
they can do we have scavenger hunts for
 
01:48:47.790 --> 01:48:47.800 align:start position:0%
the kids we have crafts that they can
 
01:48:51.589 --> 01:48:51.599 align:start position:0%
do um then then also does the services
 
01:48:53.550 --> 01:48:53.560 align:start position:0%
incl include all our
 
01:48:57.070 --> 01:48:57.080 align:start position:0%
Outreach for us we do 12 to 14 different
 
01:48:59.189 --> 01:48:59.199 align:start position:0%
Outreach programs that include story
 
01:49:02.070 --> 01:49:02.080 align:start position:0%
times stem programs Escape rooms with
 
01:49:05.550 --> 01:49:05.560 align:start position:0%
different groups we also have a
 
01:49:08.270 --> 01:49:08.280 align:start position:0%
bookmobile how am I supposed to keep
 
01:49:10.470 --> 01:49:10.480 align:start position:0%
track of 800 kids that come to a
 
01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:13.270 align:start position:0%
track of 800 kids that come to a
bookmobile

01:49:13.270 --> 01:49:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:16.030 --> 01:49:16.040 align:start position:0%
event that's where my concern is oh I
 
01:49:18.950 --> 01:49:18.960 align:start position:0%
also do a a all story time
 
01:49:21.350 --> 01:49:21.360 align:start position:0%
too um
 
01:49:24.709 --> 01:49:24.719 align:start position:0%
it's it's unreasonable if we have to do
 
01:49:27.270 --> 01:49:27.280 align:start position:0%
that we would need to increase this our
 
01:49:30.030 --> 01:49:30.040 align:start position:0%
staff maybe triple our staff which means
 
01:49:32.629 --> 01:49:32.639 align:start position:0%
there's an added cost and at a time
 
01:49:35.070 --> 01:49:35.080 align:start position:0%
where libraries some libraries are
 
01:49:39.270 --> 01:49:39.280 align:start position:0%
looking at a budget cut that's not
 
01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:40.790 align:start position:0%
looking at a budget cut that's not
feasible

01:49:40.790 --> 01:49:40.800 align:start position:0%
feasible
 
01:49:43.709 --> 01:49:43.719 align:start position:0%
also there is no one someone asked about
 
01:49:45.149 --> 01:49:45.159 align:start position:0%
is there a one system for all the
 
01:49:48.430 --> 01:49:48.440 align:start position:0%
libraries no there's not some libraries
 
01:49:52.589 --> 01:49:52.599 align:start position:0%
may not even be automated yet to handle
 
01:49:56.390 --> 01:49:56.400 align:start position:0%
this doing this stuff we're not capable
 
01:49:58.109 --> 01:49:58.119 align:start position:0%
of doing
 
01:49:58.119 --> 01:49:59.990 align:start position:0%
of doing
it

01:49:59.990 --> 01:50:00.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:50:04.149 --> 01:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
so um you got 45 seconds um also our
 
01:50:06.790 --> 01:50:06.800 align:start position:0%
unattended policy does required it has
 
01:50:09.669 --> 01:50:09.679 align:start position:0%
to be a parent or a guardian and we are
 
01:50:13.030 --> 01:50:13.040 align:start position:0%
um eight and under half parents have to
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
be with the child in the library they
 
01:50:17.629 --> 01:50:17.639 align:start position:0%
cannot be left
 
01:50:20.350 --> 01:50:20.360 align:start position:0%
alone will you take questions sure I'll
 
01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:23.159 align:start position:0%
take questions questions representative
 
01:50:26.229 --> 01:50:26.239 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman parison um so
 
01:50:27.750 --> 01:50:27.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned that you have many uh
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
programs at your school in my particular
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
town in Salem our library is right next
 
01:50:36.430 --> 01:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
to the um pretty much next to the Middle
 
01:50:40.030 --> 01:50:40.040 align:start position:0%
School yes so my question is if a child
 
01:50:42.030 --> 01:50:42.040 align:start position:0%
um signs up for an event or the parent
 
01:50:44.950 --> 01:50:44.960 align:start position:0%
signs them up for an event
 
01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
um I would imagine that they get signed
 
01:50:50.589 --> 01:50:50.599 align:start position:0%
in yep in at some way
 
01:50:52.310 --> 01:50:52.320 align:start position:0%
and then the maybe the parent later on
 
01:50:54.030 --> 01:50:54.040 align:start position:0%
wants to check and make sure did my
 
01:50:56.669 --> 01:50:56.679 align:start position:0%
child actually show up for this event or
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
are they in other words it's parents are
 
01:51:00.430 --> 01:51:00.440 align:start position:0%
trying to monitor them because the child
 
01:51:01.910 --> 01:51:01.920 align:start position:0%
walks there how do they know they really
 
01:51:04.830 --> 01:51:04.840 align:start position:0%
went the previous person said our
 
01:51:07.229 --> 01:51:07.239 align:start position:0%
library unfortunately everybody pretty
 
01:51:09.750 --> 01:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
much has to be dropped off by a parent
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
so the parents know that if they sign a
 
01:51:14.270 --> 01:51:14.280 align:start position:0%
child up for an event the only way
 
01:51:16.030 --> 01:51:16.040 align:start position:0%
they're getting there is for them to be
 
01:51:18.510 --> 01:51:18.520 align:start position:0%
dropped off the younger kids the parents
 
01:51:21.030 --> 01:51:21.040 align:start position:0%
the Guardians parents have to stay with
 
01:51:24.390 --> 01:51:24.400 align:start position:0%
them so follow up but I'm referring to
 
01:51:25.709 --> 01:51:25.719 align:start position:0%
middle school so we're talking about
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
children that are over your age yeah lot
 
01:51:30.910 --> 01:51:30.920 align:start position:0%
our middle school programs I'm going 90%
 
01:51:34.430 --> 01:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
of these kids are um dropped off by
 
01:51:35.910 --> 01:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
their parents they have to our middle
 
01:51:38.790 --> 01:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
schools are nowhere near our library so
 
01:51:40.669 --> 01:51:40.679 align:start position:0%
the parents literally have to go pick up
 
01:51:42.950 --> 01:51:42.960 align:start position:0%
the kids bring them to the library for
 
01:51:45.270 --> 01:51:45.280 align:start position:0%
the program that they have signed up for
 
01:51:46.589 --> 01:51:46.599 align:start position:0%
and then they have to come back and pick
 
01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:48.550 align:start position:0%
and then they have to come back and pick
them

01:51:48.550 --> 01:51:48.560 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:51:51.470 --> 01:51:51.480 align:start position:0%
up just representative
 
01:51:55.069 --> 01:51:55.079 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you what is the library's
 
01:51:57.470 --> 01:51:57.480 align:start position:0%
responsibility for supervising kids who
 
01:51:59.470 --> 01:51:59.480 align:start position:0%
show up at the library so I have
 
01:52:03.950 --> 01:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
teenagers now um and I can't I can't
 
01:52:05.629 --> 01:52:05.639 align:start position:0%
think of a time that I have dropped them
 
01:52:07.870 --> 01:52:07.880 align:start position:0%
off at a public place like a library or
 
01:52:11.430 --> 01:52:11.440 align:start position:0%
a museum or even a store and let them
 
01:52:13.950 --> 01:52:13.960 align:start position:0%
just wander for hours but what is a
 
01:52:16.390 --> 01:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
library's responsibility as opposed to
 
01:52:18.910 --> 01:52:18.920 align:start position:0%
other places like a museum or a store to
 
01:52:21.510 --> 01:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
supervise kids who are left there so
 
01:52:24.189 --> 01:52:24.199 align:start position:0%
when I say the parents drop the kids off
 
01:52:26.350 --> 01:52:26.360 align:start position:0%
some of them will some of them will come
 
01:52:28.270 --> 01:52:28.280 align:start position:0%
stop and drop you know get out of their
 
01:52:30.390 --> 01:52:30.400 align:start position:0%
car walk the kids into the program check
 
01:52:34.270 --> 01:52:34.280 align:start position:0%
in and then just they're there some
 
01:52:36.790 --> 01:52:36.800 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's the oh my goodness I'm
 
01:52:38.149 --> 01:52:38.159 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out how to say some
 
01:52:40.750 --> 01:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
parents will stay and they'll stay
 
01:52:42.430 --> 01:52:42.440 align:start position:0%
upstairs and wait for the parent the
 
01:52:45.030 --> 01:52:45.040 align:start position:0%
children some children say Mom and Dad I
 
01:52:46.790 --> 01:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
don't need you to stay they'll go
 
01:52:48.310 --> 01:52:48.320 align:start position:0%
quickly run do grocery shopping they'll
 
01:52:51.430 --> 01:52:51.440 align:start position:0%
come right back
 
01:52:54.149 --> 01:52:54.159 align:start position:0%
so follow up follow up thank you so in
 
01:52:55.870 --> 01:52:55.880 align:start position:0%
those circumstances where a parent has
 
01:52:58.189 --> 01:52:58.199 align:start position:0%
dropped a kid off and left the
 
01:53:01.109 --> 01:53:01.119 align:start position:0%
building what's the responsibility under
 
01:53:03.189 --> 01:53:03.199 align:start position:0%
the job descriptions or the rules for
 
01:53:06.709 --> 01:53:06.719 align:start position:0%
the library for the library to take
 
01:53:08.629 --> 01:53:08.639 align:start position:0%
responsibility for supervising those
 
01:53:12.390 --> 01:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
children like is that a paid Babysitting
 
01:53:14.790 --> 01:53:14.800 align:start position:0%
Service like what no so what I'm saying
 
01:53:17.750 --> 01:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
is these are mostly for the programs now
 
01:53:19.510 --> 01:53:19.520 align:start position:0%
if they're coming in for books the
 
01:53:21.149 --> 01:53:21.159 align:start position:0%
parent are
 
01:53:21.159 --> 01:53:22.910 align:start position:0%
parent are
there

01:53:22.910 --> 01:53:22.920 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:53:25.950 --> 01:53:25.960 align:start position:0%
but I mean we have some that'll some
 
01:53:28.109 --> 01:53:28.119 align:start position:0%
kids will just some parents will just
 
01:53:29.950 --> 01:53:29.960 align:start position:0%
quickly go do an errand or go pick up
 
01:53:32.750 --> 01:53:32.760 align:start position:0%
another child and come back so last CL
 
01:53:35.030 --> 01:53:35.040 align:start position:0%
and we have we have a staff member in
 
01:53:38.350 --> 01:53:38.360 align:start position:0%
that build in that program so last
 
01:53:40.629 --> 01:53:40.639 align:start position:0%
clarifying question yes so it's the
 
01:53:42.550 --> 01:53:42.560 align:start position:0%
parents responsibility to determine the
 
01:53:44.030 --> 01:53:44.040 align:start position:0%
maturity of their child to be
 
01:53:46.870 --> 01:53:46.880 align:start position:0%
unsupervised in your public
 
01:53:50.709 --> 01:53:50.719 align:start position:0%
space I mean that's yes okay thank you
 
01:53:53.870 --> 01:53:53.880 align:start position:0%
I have a question for you um stipulating
 
01:53:56.109 --> 01:53:56.119 align:start position:0%
your comment about line seven that the
 
01:53:58.910 --> 01:53:58.920 align:start position:0%
word Services yes could open all kinds
 
01:54:01.390 --> 01:54:01.400 align:start position:0%
of things I will stipulate to that what
 
01:54:03.950 --> 01:54:03.960 align:start position:0%
if it was just reduced to checking out
 
01:54:06.189 --> 01:54:06.199 align:start position:0%
library books would you have an
 
01:54:08.669 --> 01:54:08.679 align:start position:0%
objection to the parents knowing what
 
01:54:11.629 --> 01:54:11.639 align:start position:0%
books a minor child who was brought and
 
01:54:13.470 --> 01:54:13.480 align:start position:0%
picked up at the library by somebody
 
01:54:17.669 --> 01:54:17.679 align:start position:0%
other than the child's parents was piing
 
01:54:21.270 --> 01:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
out no I mean that would make our life a
 
01:54:25.550 --> 01:54:25.560 align:start position:0%
little bit easier okay thank you any
 
01:54:31.430 --> 01:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:34.310 --> 01:54:34.320 align:start position:0%
much and the chair recognizes Amber
 
01:54:41.950 --> 01:54:41.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:45.950 --> 01:54:45.960 align:start position:0%
minutes you pass first test thank you
 
01:54:47.910 --> 01:54:47.920 align:start position:0%
welcome uh my name's Amber Coughlin I'm
 
01:54:50.310 --> 01:54:50.320 align:start position:0%
the children's librarian at Lebanon
 
01:54:53.109 --> 01:54:53.119 align:start position:0%
libraries uh in Lebanon New Hampshire
 
01:54:57.149 --> 01:54:57.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm opposed to this bill um as you
 
01:55:00.069 --> 01:55:00.079 align:start position:0%
know New Hampshire has pretty great laws
 
01:55:01.870 --> 01:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
protecting the confidentially
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
confidentiality of Library users records
 
01:55:08.550 --> 01:55:08.560 align:start position:0%
and as such libraries tend to collect
 
01:55:10.830 --> 01:55:10.840 align:start position:0%
just the information about our patrons
 
01:55:13.430 --> 01:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
that we need to conduct business every
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
day and nothing more many of the
 
01:55:19.109 --> 01:55:19.119 align:start position:0%
activities in fact I would say the bulk
 
01:55:20.750 --> 01:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
of the activi that people engage in in
 
01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%
the library do not generate records um
 
01:55:26.870 --> 01:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
on at my library on any given day you
 
01:55:28.470 --> 01:55:28.480 align:start position:0%
know in addition to checking out books
 
01:55:31.189 --> 01:55:31.199 align:start position:0%
and materials uh we could be hosting a
 
01:55:34.430 --> 01:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
music Pro program for toddlers or a
 
01:55:37.270 --> 01:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
blues guitar Workshop that's
 
01:55:39.629 --> 01:55:39.639 align:start position:0%
intergenerational um we might offer
 
01:55:43.350 --> 01:55:43.360 align:start position:0%
crafts that you take home with you or um
 
01:55:45.990 --> 01:55:46.000 align:start position:0%
you might do a craft program right in
 
01:55:47.990 --> 01:55:48.000 align:start position:0%
the library we might have musical
 
01:55:50.350 --> 01:55:50.360 align:start position:0%
performances we might have yoga we might
 
01:55:52.870 --> 01:55:52.880 align:start position:0%
have animals there that you know for
 
01:55:55.910 --> 01:55:55.920 align:start position:0%
kids to learn about Raptors or
 
01:55:58.390 --> 01:55:58.400 align:start position:0%
amphibians there are all kinds of things
 
01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%
happening inside the library and outside
 
01:56:03.069 --> 01:56:03.079 align:start position:0%
the library we have Community Gardens we
 
01:56:05.149 --> 01:56:05.159 align:start position:0%
have a wonderful Green Space that people
 
01:56:07.669 --> 01:56:07.679 align:start position:0%
come and enjoy their lunch on beautiful
 
01:56:11.430 --> 01:56:11.440 align:start position:0%
days our WiFi is all around the building
 
01:56:13.149 --> 01:56:13.159 align:start position:0%
so sometimes people are just checking
 
01:56:15.270 --> 01:56:15.280 align:start position:0%
their email in the parking lot before
 
01:56:19.669 --> 01:56:19.679 align:start position:0%
the library is even open um it's a
 
01:56:22.990 --> 01:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
public space um lots of people just stop
 
01:56:24.790 --> 01:56:24.800 align:start position:0%
by just to browse for a few minutes
 
01:56:26.629 --> 01:56:26.639 align:start position:0%
while they're waiting for the bus they
 
01:56:28.990 --> 01:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
don't even necessarily have a library
 
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:31.589 align:start position:0%
don't even necessarily have a library
card

01:56:31.589 --> 01:56:31.599 align:start position:0%
card
 
01:56:35.229 --> 01:56:35.239 align:start position:0%
um it's a busy Place uh there's a lot
 
01:56:38.510 --> 01:56:38.520 align:start position:0%
going on but it's a public place our
 
01:56:42.830 --> 01:56:42.840 align:start position:0%
space and our Stacks are open to anyone
 
01:56:46.510 --> 01:56:46.520 align:start position:0%
and everyone we don't surveil the stacks
 
01:56:48.669 --> 01:56:48.679 align:start position:0%
to see who has taken a given title off
 
01:56:51.229 --> 01:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
the shelf we don't have the capacity to
 
01:56:54.229 --> 01:56:54.239 align:start position:0%
conduct these investigations into who
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
might be a person who is legal legally
 
01:56:59.669 --> 01:56:59.679 align:start position:0%
entitled to see a child's records and
 
01:57:02.270 --> 01:57:02.280 align:start position:0%
who does not and of course I don't need
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
to remind you that children are not
 
01:57:06.790 --> 01:57:06.800 align:start position:0%
always safe with their parents um and
 
01:57:08.109 --> 01:57:08.119 align:start position:0%
families struggling with domestic
 
01:57:10.669 --> 01:57:10.679 align:start position:0%
violence often depend on carefully
 
01:57:14.030 --> 01:57:14.040 align:start position:0%
maintaining strict standards of privacy
 
01:57:15.990 --> 01:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
in order to keep themselves safe from
 
01:57:19.069 --> 01:57:19.079 align:start position:0%
their abusers we keep minimal records
 
01:57:20.950 --> 01:57:20.960 align:start position:0%
for patrons out of respect for their
 
01:57:24.229 --> 01:57:24.239 align:start position:0%
individual privacy which is so important
 
01:57:27.109 --> 01:57:27.119 align:start position:0%
for freedom of inquiry freedom of
 
01:57:30.189 --> 01:57:30.199 align:start position:0%
thought we consider our policies really
 
01:57:31.830 --> 01:57:31.840 align:start position:0%
carefully they're not made just
 
01:57:31.840 --> 01:57:33.189 align:start position:0%
carefully they're not made just
willy-nilly

01:57:33.189 --> 01:57:33.199 align:start position:0%
willy-nilly
 
01:57:36.149 --> 01:57:36.159 align:start position:0%
um I do hope you will consider these
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
issues um and understand why I am
 
01:57:43.430 --> 01:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
strongly opposed to this bill um we have
 
01:57:44.990 --> 01:57:45.000 align:start position:0%
tried to develop our circulation
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
policies with maximal flexibility for uh
 
01:57:53.669 --> 01:57:53.679 align:start position:0%
parents and families there is no um
 
01:57:57.069 --> 01:57:57.079 align:start position:0%
barrier to a family opening up a family
 
01:58:00.030 --> 01:58:00.040 align:start position:0%
card that maybe has a single email
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
address attached to it so that you know
 
01:58:05.629 --> 01:58:05.639 align:start position:0%
if you do have five kids and you don't
 
01:58:07.629 --> 01:58:07.639 align:start position:0%
want to keep track of five separate
 
01:58:10.870 --> 01:58:10.880 align:start position:0%
library cards and and you just want one
 
01:58:12.270 --> 01:58:12.280 align:start position:0%
list of everything your family has
 
01:58:15.910 --> 01:58:15.920 align:start position:0%
checked out that is easily available but
 
01:58:19.350 --> 01:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
if a person any Patron opens up an IND
 
01:58:22.750 --> 01:58:22.760 align:start position:0%
indidual library card by themselves with
 
01:58:25.189 --> 01:58:25.199 align:start position:0%
nobody else's contact information
 
01:58:29.589 --> 01:58:29.599 align:start position:0%
attached to it we only give out that
 
01:58:32.990 --> 01:58:33.000 align:start position:0%
identifying information to the holder of
 
01:58:35.910 --> 01:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
that card thank you very much um you
 
01:58:38.550 --> 01:58:38.560 align:start position:0%
keep minimal records as a person who's a
 
01:58:40.430 --> 01:58:40.440 align:start position:0%
total scatter brain I really like that
 
01:58:42.669 --> 01:58:42.679 align:start position:0%
that's why I have smart people on going
 
01:58:46.390 --> 01:58:46.400 align:start position:0%
down the rows here uh but you do keep a
 
01:58:49.589 --> 01:58:49.599 align:start position:0%
record yes of who checks out what one
 
01:58:52.189 --> 01:58:52.199 align:start position:0%
book else you could not find them or
 
01:58:55.149 --> 01:58:55.159 align:start position:0%
retrieve your book and so if this were
 
01:58:59.109 --> 01:58:59.119 align:start position:0%
changed to just children taking out
 
01:59:01.790 --> 01:59:01.800 align:start position:0%
library books and nothing else would you
 
01:59:04.589 --> 01:59:04.599 align:start position:0%
still have an objection I would have an
 
01:59:07.109 --> 01:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
objection okay thank you other questions
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you um and
 
01:59:12.350 --> 01:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question ma
 
01:59:13.910 --> 01:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
you've jogged my thought on something
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
and so frequently my um 13-year-old who
 
01:59:19.709 --> 01:59:19.719 align:start position:0%
is a scatter brain uh like chairman
 
01:59:22.390 --> 01:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
describes himself has lost her card or
 
01:59:23.950 --> 01:59:23.960 align:start position:0%
doesn't have her card so we frequently
 
01:59:26.270 --> 01:59:26.280 align:start position:0%
take out books on whoever happens to be
 
01:59:28.149 --> 01:59:28.159 align:start position:0%
the person checking out with her which
 
01:59:30.990 --> 01:59:31.000 align:start position:0%
would be me um would a parent like
 
01:59:33.390 --> 01:59:33.400 align:start position:0%
myself have access to that record if if
 
01:59:35.310 --> 01:59:35.320 align:start position:0%
it was checked out under my card as a
 
01:59:37.950 --> 01:59:37.960 align:start position:0%
parent Oh Oh you mean if if your say
 
01:59:40.109 --> 01:59:40.119 align:start position:0%
your daughter checked a book out on your
 
01:59:42.669 --> 01:59:42.679 align:start position:0%
library card yes oh yeah I mean that's
 
01:59:45.669 --> 01:59:45.679 align:start position:0%
your library card so you if you are
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
generous enough to offer your library
 
01:59:49.790 --> 01:59:49.800 align:start position:0%
card to your daughter who doesn't have
 
01:59:52.950 --> 01:59:52.960 align:start position:0%
her own then yeah you can see what you
 
01:59:54.470 --> 01:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
have checked cuz you're checking it out
 
01:59:57.149 --> 01:59:57.159 align:start position:0%
on her behalf essentially followup
 
02:00:00.950 --> 02:00:00.960 align:start position:0%
followups how um frequently do library
 
02:00:02.510 --> 02:00:02.520 align:start position:0%
cards in your system expire I know
 
02:00:05.189 --> 02:00:05.199 align:start position:0%
nashaa it's like five years um we just
 
02:00:09.229 --> 02:00:09.239 align:start position:0%
changed it to two years every two years
 
02:00:11.950 --> 02:00:11.960 align:start position:0%
they expire in that we want to touch
 
02:00:13.310 --> 02:00:13.320 align:start position:0%
base with people and see if they still
 
02:00:14.910 --> 02:00:14.920 align:start position:0%
live in the same place and have the same
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
contact information okay so every 2
 
02:00:19.470 --> 02:00:19.480 align:start position:0%
years a person has to basically renew
 
02:00:20.990 --> 02:00:21.000 align:start position:0%
their library card and verify the
 
02:00:23.470 --> 02:00:23.480 align:start position:0%
information yes okay that includes
 
02:00:25.669 --> 02:00:25.679 align:start position:0%
children's library cards yep all the
 
02:00:29.470 --> 02:00:29.480 align:start position:0%
cards expire um after a certain period
 
02:00:32.830 --> 02:00:32.840 align:start position:0%
of time or a period of disuse um the
 
02:00:34.870 --> 02:00:34.880 align:start position:0%
system is sort of built in such a way
 
02:00:37.390 --> 02:00:37.400 align:start position:0%
that they automatically expire and then
 
02:00:39.870 --> 02:00:39.880 align:start position:0%
if any further activity with that
 
02:00:42.350 --> 02:00:42.360 align:start position:0%
library card tries to take place it's
 
02:00:44.310 --> 02:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
it's blocked it says hey your card's
 
02:00:47.990 --> 02:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
expired see the librarian um and and
 
02:00:49.910 --> 02:00:49.920 align:start position:0%
people will call us and say say hey I
 
02:00:51.910 --> 02:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
still live in the same place can you
 
02:00:54.390 --> 02:00:54.400 align:start position:0%
turn my library card back on and we do
 
02:00:55.830 --> 02:00:55.840 align:start position:0%
so listening to this here's a
 
02:00:59.030 --> 02:00:59.040 align:start position:0%
hypothetical suppose a parent wants to
 
02:01:02.109 --> 02:01:02.119 align:start position:0%
know what books the child checks out so
 
02:01:04.350 --> 02:01:04.360 align:start position:0%
the parent does not sponsor the child to
 
02:01:07.750 --> 02:01:07.760 align:start position:0%
get a card but the parent at some risk
 
02:01:11.350 --> 02:01:11.360 align:start position:0%
to loss by scatterbrain children gives
 
02:01:14.149 --> 02:01:14.159 align:start position:0%
the child the parents card and the child
 
02:01:16.430 --> 02:01:16.440 align:start position:0%
checks out the books no harm no foul the
 
02:01:17.750 --> 02:01:17.760 align:start position:0%
parent knows what books have been
 
02:01:19.270 --> 02:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
checked out because the kid doesn't does
 
02:01:22.149 --> 02:01:22.159 align:start position:0%
have a card is that possible oh that's
 
02:01:25.189 --> 02:01:25.199 align:start position:0%
yeah that's entirely possible thank you
 
02:01:27.430 --> 02:01:27.440 align:start position:0%
yeah any other
 
02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:28.950 align:start position:0%
yeah any other
questions

02:01:28.950 --> 02:01:28.960 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:01:31.870 --> 02:01:31.880 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
02:01:36.709 --> 02:01:36.719 align:start position:0%
chairman um so the benefits
 
02:01:39.950 --> 02:01:39.960 align:start position:0%
to and correct me if I'm wrong uh the
 
02:01:43.750 --> 02:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
benefits to checking out a book under
 
02:01:47.830 --> 02:01:47.840 align:start position:0%
the parent would be that if the book got
 
02:01:50.910 --> 02:01:50.920 align:start position:0%
lost that then it could get
 
02:01:53.149 --> 02:01:53.159 align:start position:0%
replaced um I know I've done that
 
02:01:56.390 --> 02:01:56.400 align:start position:0%
actually at the Manchester Library um
 
02:02:00.390 --> 02:02:00.400 align:start position:0%
where it where my my son was maybe three
 
02:02:03.149 --> 02:02:03.159 align:start position:0%
at the time and he kind of tore apart
 
02:02:04.750 --> 02:02:04.760 align:start position:0%
the book and so I just bought a
 
02:02:07.870 --> 02:02:07.880 align:start position:0%
replacement from Amazon and just gave it
 
02:02:10.270 --> 02:02:10.280 align:start position:0%
a new book to the library with the same
 
02:02:12.990 --> 02:02:13.000 align:start position:0%
title um because it was better because
 
02:02:14.350 --> 02:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
it's like I I'm never going to be able
 
02:02:16.870 --> 02:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
to return this so how would I just get
 
02:02:21.870 --> 02:02:21.880 align:start position:0%
you a new one um so but the but the con
 
02:02:25.629 --> 02:02:25.639 align:start position:0%
basically is that eventually the child
 
02:02:27.470 --> 02:02:27.480 align:start position:0%
will have their own freedom of thought
 
02:02:31.750 --> 02:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
and would want so I
 
02:02:33.390 --> 02:02:33.400 align:start position:0%
guess I
 
02:02:37.030 --> 02:02:37.040 align:start position:0%
do I I'm trying to form this as a
 
02:02:41.350 --> 02:02:41.360 align:start position:0%
question um at what age can a child
 
02:02:43.069 --> 02:02:43.079 align:start position:0%
check books out on their own and open
 
02:02:46.229 --> 02:02:46.239 align:start position:0%
their own library card we have decided
 
02:02:48.189 --> 02:02:48.199 align:start position:0%
at our library and of course this varies
 
02:02:50.430 --> 02:02:50.440 align:start position:0%
from library to library that at 8 years
 
02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
of age you can open up your own library
 
02:02:55.550 --> 02:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
card if you're able to provide all of
 
02:02:57.709 --> 02:02:57.719 align:start position:0%
the relevant information that you need
 
02:02:59.669 --> 02:02:59.679 align:start position:0%
to open a library card so how would the
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
an eight-year-old pay their fee we
 
02:03:05.950 --> 02:03:05.960 align:start position:0%
actually don't have fines in Lebanon um
 
02:03:08.149 --> 02:03:08.159 align:start position:0%
but if an 8-year-old child on their
 
02:03:11.189 --> 02:03:11.199 align:start position:0%
library card say had taken out a copy of
 
02:03:13.470 --> 02:03:13.480 align:start position:0%
Harry Potter and lost it and never
 
02:03:16.790 --> 02:03:16.800 align:start position:0%
returned it it wouldn't be the in my
 
02:03:17.870 --> 02:03:17.880 align:start position:0%
library it wouldn't be the
 
02:03:19.390 --> 02:03:19.400 align:start position:0%
responsibility of the parent parents to
 
02:03:22.030 --> 02:03:22.040 align:start position:0%
pay for that that would be on the
 
02:03:25.030 --> 02:03:25.040 align:start position:0%
child's library card if the child had
 
02:03:27.229 --> 02:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
made the decision to open up an
 
02:03:29.069 --> 02:03:29.079 align:start position:0%
individual library card and let me tell
 
02:03:30.870 --> 02:03:30.880 align:start position:0%
you most of the kids especially if
 
02:03:33.390 --> 02:03:33.400 align:start position:0%
they're nine or 10 and they want their
 
02:03:35.229 --> 02:03:35.239 align:start position:0%
own library card they always want to
 
02:03:38.149 --> 02:03:38.159 align:start position:0%
give me their mom's email address when I
 
02:03:40.470 --> 02:03:40.480 align:start position:0%
tell them hey there's going to be emails
 
02:03:42.350 --> 02:03:42.360 align:start position:0%
going out before your books are due to
 
02:03:44.910 --> 02:03:44.920 align:start position:0%
remind you that your books are due to
 
02:03:47.189 --> 02:03:47.199 align:start position:0%
remind you to bring them back uh do you
 
02:03:48.589 --> 02:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
have an email address or do you want us
 
02:03:51.189 --> 02:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
to phone you and they're like oh no why
 
02:03:53.189 --> 02:03:53.199 align:start position:0%
don't I give you my mom's email address
 
02:03:54.669 --> 02:03:54.679 align:start position:0%
we got to pick up the pace here any
 
02:03:54.679 --> 02:03:55.870 align:start position:0%
we got to pick up the pace here any
further

02:03:55.870 --> 02:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
further
 
02:03:58.750 --> 02:03:58.760 align:start position:0%
questions uh seeing none thank you so
 
02:04:02.109 --> 02:04:02.119 align:start position:0%
much you know that previous homage you
 
02:04:04.229 --> 02:04:04.239 align:start position:0%
gave to your library that should be
 
02:04:06.270 --> 02:04:06.280 align:start position:0%
recorded and put on public access that
 
02:04:08.990 --> 02:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
was brilliant that was really good and
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%

02:04:42.510 --> 02:04:42.520 align:start position:0%
1308 uh I do want to point out that
 
02:04:44.030 --> 02:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
there's been some discussion about the
 
02:04:46.350 --> 02:04:46.360 align:start position:0%
scope of the records that um would be uh
 
02:04:49.470 --> 02:04:49.480 align:start position:0%
covered under this under this bill uh in
 
02:04:53.189 --> 02:04:53.199 align:start position:0%
the new section 2 a uh you know it says
 
02:04:55.750 --> 02:04:55.760 align:start position:0%
all Library records related to materials
 
02:04:57.589 --> 02:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
or services and the prior paragraph
 
02:04:59.790 --> 02:04:59.800 align:start position:0%
there's a really expansive definition of
 
02:05:01.790 --> 02:05:01.800 align:start position:0%
what records are actually protected by
 
02:05:05.270 --> 02:05:05.280 align:start position:0%
the law um paragraph 2A could be amended
 
02:05:07.950 --> 02:05:07.960 align:start position:0%
to say just material Just Books the the
 
02:05:09.109 --> 02:05:09.119 align:start position:0%
names of books that have been checked
 
02:05:10.870 --> 02:05:10.880 align:start position:0%
out right it could just be books that
 
02:05:12.270 --> 02:05:12.280 align:start position:0%
are out for circulation but it hasn't
 
02:05:13.709 --> 02:05:13.719 align:start position:0%
been narrowed in that way instead it's a
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
really expansive definition of records
 
02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:17.520 align:start position:0%
and I'm concerned that it could include
 
02:05:20.310 --> 02:05:20.320 align:start position:0%
things like internet browser history um
 
02:05:22.390 --> 02:05:22.400 align:start position:0%
at a library uh
 
02:05:24.430 --> 02:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
computer which of course is an issue
 
02:05:26.950 --> 02:05:26.960 align:start position:0%
that's uh you know ripe for uh
 
02:05:28.870 --> 02:05:28.880 align:start position:0%
discussion about where individual
 
02:05:32.189 --> 02:05:32.199 align:start position:0%
privacy rights lie um the
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
confidentiality statute that's you know
 
02:05:37.229 --> 02:05:37.239 align:start position:0%
proposes to be amended here it's it's a
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
statutory right to confidentiality but
 
02:05:40.870 --> 02:05:40.880 align:start position:0%
it's rooted in constitutional
 
02:05:43.510 --> 02:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
protections uh you know first amendment
 
02:05:46.830 --> 02:05:46.840 align:start position:0%
uh protections and to to the right to
 
02:05:49.310 --> 02:05:49.320 align:start position:0%
receive information right and and um
 
02:05:50.709 --> 02:05:50.719 align:start position:0%
it's an essential right that's been
 
02:05:52.629 --> 02:05:52.639 align:start position:0%
embedded in the Constitution forever of
 
02:05:53.990 --> 02:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
course or as long as the Constitution
 
02:05:55.629 --> 02:05:55.639 align:start position:0%
has been around same with the State
 
02:05:58.750 --> 02:05:58.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution and um that that
 
02:06:01.589 --> 02:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
confidentiality is is so crucial and and
 
02:06:03.549 --> 02:06:03.559 align:start position:0%
I want to note that the American Library
 
02:06:06.790 --> 02:06:06.800 align:start position:0%
Association uh uh which is you know a
 
02:06:09.189 --> 02:06:09.199 align:start position:0%
major Library Association they interpret
 
02:06:11.109 --> 02:06:11.119 align:start position:0%
the right to confidentiality to be for
 
02:06:12.870 --> 02:06:12.880 align:start position:0%
children for minors to be co-extensive
 
02:06:14.109 --> 02:06:14.119 align:start position:0%
with that of adults meaning they don't
 
02:06:15.430 --> 02:06:15.440 align:start position:0%
see a difference between the right to
 
02:06:17.149 --> 02:06:17.159 align:start position:0%
confidentiality for children and the
 
02:06:19.109 --> 02:06:19.119 align:start position:0%
right to confidentiality for adults and
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
I believe the prime sponsor was saying
 
02:06:22.229 --> 02:06:22.239 align:start position:0%
that every organization agrees with her
 
02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:23.719 align:start position:0%
that privacy should be limited when it
 
02:06:25.229 --> 02:06:25.239 align:start position:0%
comes to Children the American Library
 
02:06:26.790 --> 02:06:26.800 align:start position:0%
Association does not
 
02:06:30.109 --> 02:06:30.119 align:start position:0%
agree um in the school context there are
 
02:06:32.830 --> 02:06:32.840 align:start position:0%
certain laws and obligations that
 
02:06:35.229 --> 02:06:35.239 align:start position:0%
require disclosure of information by
 
02:06:38.350 --> 02:06:38.360 align:start position:0%
schools to parents uh whe even when it's
 
02:06:39.430 --> 02:06:39.440 align:start position:0%
not requested and that includes
 
02:06:41.430 --> 02:06:41.440 align:start position:0%
information about treny and attendance
 
02:06:44.069 --> 02:06:44.079 align:start position:0%
right information about grades uh there
 
02:06:45.629 --> 02:06:45.639 align:start position:0%
are requirements for disclosure of
 
02:06:46.990 --> 02:06:47.000 align:start position:0%
information when a student is the
 
02:06:48.990 --> 02:06:49.000 align:start position:0%
subject of an investigation when the
 
02:06:51.790 --> 02:06:51.800 align:start position:0%
student is uh alleged to be the victim
 
02:06:53.549 --> 02:06:53.559 align:start position:0%
of sexual assaults these are all cases
 
02:06:56.589 --> 02:06:56.599 align:start position:0%
in which statutes have defined um areas
 
02:06:58.629 --> 02:06:58.639 align:start position:0%
where parental notification of
 
02:07:02.229 --> 02:07:02.239 align:start position:0%
information is required and to date uh
 
02:07:03.910 --> 02:07:03.920 align:start position:0%
there has been no law that requires
 
02:07:05.629 --> 02:07:05.639 align:start position:0%
disclosure of Library information about
 
02:07:09.549 --> 02:07:09.559 align:start position:0%
what happens at libraries uh in in um in
 
02:07:12.669 --> 02:07:12.679 align:start position:0%
in in public schools and so uh I want to
 
02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
talk for a moment just very quickly
 
02:07:17.030 --> 02:07:17.040 align:start position:0%
about furpa which is the student record
 
02:07:19.709 --> 02:07:19.719 align:start position:0%
disclosure law and you got one minute
 
02:07:22.270 --> 02:07:22.280 align:start position:0%
yes that law uh requires disclosure of
 
02:07:23.750 --> 02:07:23.760 align:start position:0%
certain certain records but it's
 
02:07:25.830 --> 02:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
narrowly defined as records that are
 
02:07:27.750 --> 02:07:27.760 align:start position:0%
kept in a central database um the
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court's interpreted Vera to that
 
02:07:33.189 --> 02:07:33.199 align:start position:0%
to that extent um so the reason that I'm
 
02:07:34.350 --> 02:07:34.360 align:start position:0%
here and I'm testifying in the first
 
02:07:36.149 --> 02:07:36.159 align:start position:0%
place is just because lgbtq students
 
02:07:37.470 --> 02:07:37.480 align:start position:0%
have a really special interest in
 
02:07:39.350 --> 02:07:39.360 align:start position:0%
confidentiality when they're in a school
 
02:07:42.189 --> 02:07:42.199 align:start position:0%
library I've heard from many lgbtq young
 
02:07:44.589 --> 02:07:44.599 align:start position:0%
people about how the school library or a
 
02:07:46.430 --> 02:07:46.440 align:start position:0%
public library is a place of sanctuary
 
02:07:48.149 --> 02:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
for them a place where they can see
 
02:07:50.350 --> 02:07:50.360 align:start position:0%
their life reflected can understand
 
02:07:51.990 --> 02:07:52.000 align:start position:0%
really difficult things about their
 
02:07:53.990 --> 02:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
identity and can get the strength and
 
02:07:55.790 --> 02:07:55.800 align:start position:0%
skills that they need to go back home
 
02:07:57.870 --> 02:07:57.880 align:start position:0%
and have these important conversations
 
02:08:00.629 --> 02:08:00.639 align:start position:0%
this bill could put libraries and uh and
 
02:08:02.790 --> 02:08:02.800 align:start position:0%
public schools in the middle of these
 
02:08:04.709 --> 02:08:04.719 align:start position:0%
deep intense family moments that really
 
02:08:06.069 --> 02:08:06.079 align:start position:0%
should be between parents and their
 
02:08:08.589 --> 02:08:08.599 align:start position:0%
children and as was noted earlier in
 
02:08:10.390 --> 02:08:10.400 align:start position:0%
this hearing there is absolutely no
 
02:08:12.470 --> 02:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
reason that parents um should not have
 
02:08:14.549 --> 02:08:14.559 align:start position:0%
unfettered access to their children to
 
02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
ask them questions about what they're
 
02:08:19.950 --> 02:08:19.960 align:start position:0%
breeding and uh and and this bill is
 
02:08:21.830 --> 02:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
unnecessary to allow that free exchange
 
02:08:23.430 --> 02:08:23.440 align:start position:0%
of information
 
02:08:25.589 --> 02:08:25.599 align:start position:0%
between their
 
02:08:27.790 --> 02:08:27.800 align:start position:0%
children I'd be happy to take questions
 
02:08:27.800 --> 02:08:29.629 align:start position:0%
children I'd be happy to take questions
thank

02:08:29.629 --> 02:08:29.639 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
you seeing none thank
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:40.990 --> 02:08:41.000 align:start position:0%
Beerman I think that's is it do we have
 
02:08:44.510 --> 02:08:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.390 --> 02:08:47.400 align:start position:0%
you eight years in the
 
02:08:50.030 --> 02:08:50.040 align:start position:0%
house no relation to the Plymouth
 
02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:51.510 align:start position:0%
house no relation to the Plymouth
restaurant

02:08:51.510 --> 02:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
restaurant
 
02:08:54.149 --> 02:08:54.159 align:start position:0%
unfortunately sorry can't get you a deal
 
02:08:57.470 --> 02:08:57.480 align:start position:0%
on a okay four minutes starting now
 
02:09:00.709 --> 02:09:00.719 align:start position:0%
thank you um as I've listened to the uh
 
02:09:03.549 --> 02:09:03.559 align:start position:0%
testimony that has been given
 
02:09:06.589 --> 02:09:06.599 align:start position:0%
here I keep hearing that libraries have
 
02:09:09.189 --> 02:09:09.199 align:start position:0%
to be responsible for certain things no
 
02:09:11.750 --> 02:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
they don't if there is a domestic abuse
 
02:09:15.069 --> 02:09:15.079 align:start position:0%
or a domestic issue in a home it is the
 
02:09:18.589 --> 02:09:18.599 align:start position:0%
parents responsibility to inform the
 
02:09:20.709 --> 02:09:20.719 align:start position:0%
school and the library wherever their
 
02:09:23.629 --> 02:09:23.639 align:start position:0%
child is if there is a custody situation
 
02:09:25.669 --> 02:09:25.679 align:start position:0%
that is not the library's job that is
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
the parents job and parents need to step
 
02:09:30.950 --> 02:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
up and take responsibility for their
 
02:09:33.549 --> 02:09:33.559 align:start position:0%
children I've looked into the library
 
02:09:36.870 --> 02:09:36.880 align:start position:0%
policies of this town I live in and it
 
02:09:38.990 --> 02:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
says it's the parents duty to monitor
 
02:09:40.870 --> 02:09:40.880 align:start position:0%
what the child takes out from the public
 
02:09:43.629 --> 02:09:43.639 align:start position:0%
library so if it's the parents duty to
 
02:09:46.229 --> 02:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
monitor then it should be the parents
 
02:09:49.270 --> 02:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
ability to also look and see what that
 
02:09:53.149 --> 02:09:53.159 align:start position:0%
child has taken out um I don't think
 
02:09:55.830 --> 02:09:55.840 align:start position:0%
that the library should be becoming be
 
02:09:58.229 --> 02:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
coming between a parent and a child and
 
02:10:01.270 --> 02:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
keeping secrets um we have seen more and
 
02:10:03.830 --> 02:10:03.840 align:start position:0%
more times where schools are getting
 
02:10:06.430 --> 02:10:06.440 align:start position:0%
between parents rights and children's
 
02:10:08.589 --> 02:10:08.599 align:start position:0%
information and keeping secrets about
 
02:10:11.350 --> 02:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
the child so if a parent wants access to
 
02:10:13.350 --> 02:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
that information they should have access
 
02:10:15.910 --> 02:10:15.920 align:start position:0%
that is their child nobody should be
 
02:10:19.149 --> 02:10:19.159 align:start position:0%
standing in between them and a
 
02:10:23.589 --> 02:10:23.599 align:start position:0%
parent and that's about it any other
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
questions concerns problems any
 
02:10:29.229 --> 02:10:29.239 align:start position:0%

Mr chairman jel Binet I'm the legal
 
02:11:30.589 --> 02:11:30.599 align:start position:0%
director at the eclu of New Hampshire I
 
02:11:32.030 --> 02:11:32.040 align:start position:0%
have submitted written testimony it's
 
02:11:34.149 --> 02:11:34.159 align:start position:0%
it's joint testimony between the ACLU
 
02:11:36.830 --> 02:11:36.840 align:start position:0%
and glad which previously spoke and I do
 
02:11:38.470 --> 02:11:38.480 align:start position:0%
promise to keep this under uh four
 
02:11:40.950 --> 02:11:40.960 align:start position:0%
minutes we are in opposition to this
 
02:11:42.510 --> 02:11:42.520 align:start position:0%
bill and I just want to Echo some of the
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
concerns that um that glad conveyed
 
02:11:48.589 --> 02:11:48.599 align:start position:0%
about just the nature and scope um of of
 
02:11:50.870 --> 02:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
this of this bill it doesn't just
 
02:11:53.189 --> 02:11:53.199 align:start position:0%
include right the the checking out of
 
02:11:56.109 --> 02:11:56.119 align:start position:0%
books But it includes you know Library
 
02:11:59.109 --> 02:11:59.119 align:start position:0%
records related to use of Library
 
02:12:01.830 --> 02:12:01.840 align:start position:0%
materials or services so it could it it
 
02:12:03.870 --> 02:12:03.880 align:start position:0%
it really is everything so I just wanted
 
02:12:06.390 --> 02:12:06.400 align:start position:0%
to flag that particular scope in the
 
02:12:08.990 --> 02:12:09.000 align:start position:0%
event that um that is of concern to some
 
02:12:11.270 --> 02:12:11.280 align:start position:0%
because it is certainly concern to to
 
02:12:13.709 --> 02:12:13.719 align:start position:0%
myself um I can also say too that this
 
02:12:15.990 --> 02:12:16.000 align:start position:0%
is I think much it is more at least in
 
02:12:18.910 --> 02:12:18.920 align:start position:0%
my view than a disclosure law it it also
 
02:12:21.990 --> 02:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
is a retention law from my vantage point
 
02:12:24.589 --> 02:12:24.599 align:start position:0%
that all records need to be available
 
02:12:26.790 --> 02:12:26.800 align:start position:0%
which means that I I think a plausible
 
02:12:28.310 --> 02:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
interpretation of that is all those
 
02:12:30.270 --> 02:12:30.280 align:start position:0%
records need to be retained and if that
 
02:12:33.470 --> 02:12:33.480 align:start position:0%
is true then this is uh would require a
 
02:12:35.910 --> 02:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
massive use of resources among our
 
02:12:38.350 --> 02:12:38.360 align:start position:0%
libraries in this state some of which
 
02:12:40.109 --> 02:12:40.119 align:start position:0%
may not collect all of the information
 
02:12:41.870 --> 02:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's required to be collected under
 
02:12:44.830 --> 02:12:44.840 align:start position:0%
the bill given how broad the the scope
 
02:12:46.470 --> 02:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
is so I just want to flag that because
 
02:12:48.229 --> 02:12:48.239 align:start position:0%
we all know it's not just libraries but
 
02:12:50.830 --> 02:12:50.840 align:start position:0%
law enforcement fire are all strapped
 
02:12:52.430 --> 02:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
for resources and I think this would
 
02:12:54.030 --> 02:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
cause our libraries to be further
 
02:12:56.510 --> 02:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
strapped for resources because the I
 
02:12:58.270 --> 02:12:58.280 align:start position:0%
think this is a retention bill in
 
02:13:00.589 --> 02:13:00.599 align:start position:0%
addition to a disclosure bill I do think
 
02:13:03.030 --> 02:13:03.040 align:start position:0%
the privacy concerns here are are are
 
02:13:05.589 --> 02:13:05.599 align:start position:0%
very real and I do think that this is
 
02:13:07.549 --> 02:13:07.559 align:start position:0%
you know different than report cards and
 
02:13:08.950 --> 02:13:08.960 align:start position:0%
that types of things like we're talk
 
02:13:10.470 --> 02:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about books that we
 
02:13:13.229 --> 02:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
read right in many circumstances we're
 
02:13:15.549 --> 02:13:15.559 align:start position:0%
talking about uh we're revealing a part
 
02:13:17.510 --> 02:13:17.520 align:start position:0%
of ourselves right and sometimes we
 
02:13:19.109 --> 02:13:19.119 align:start position:0%
don't want that part to be shared with
 
02:13:21.790 --> 02:13:21.800 align:start position:0%
the world and what we read can really be
 
02:13:25.470 --> 02:13:25.480 align:start position:0%
an indicia of of intimate details of our
 
02:13:27.030 --> 02:13:27.040 align:start position:0%
life whether we're trying to read a book
 
02:13:29.310 --> 02:13:29.320 align:start position:0%
to Grapple with an abuse that we suffer
 
02:13:31.390 --> 02:13:31.400 align:start position:0%
whether we're trying to read a book uh
 
02:13:33.589 --> 02:13:33.599 align:start position:0%
you know because we're 17 and you know
 
02:13:35.310 --> 02:13:35.320 align:start position:0%
we're trying to figure ourselves out
 
02:13:37.589 --> 02:13:37.599 align:start position:0%
those are very intimate things and I
 
02:13:39.109 --> 02:13:39.119 align:start position:0%
think we all know that we were all kids
 
02:13:41.990 --> 02:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
once right and I think there are there
 
02:13:45.189 --> 02:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
can be very real consequences to having
 
02:13:47.589 --> 02:13:47.599 align:start position:0%
that information disclosed and outed
 
02:13:49.870 --> 02:13:49.880 align:start position:0%
when that that child is not necessarily
 
02:13:51.910 --> 02:13:51.920 align:start position:0%
ready could be safety concerns could be
 
02:13:54.149 --> 02:13:54.159 align:start position:0%
other concerns but there I do think is
 
02:13:57.149 --> 02:13:57.159 align:start position:0%
some degree of privacy here that is
 
02:13:59.069 --> 02:13:59.079 align:start position:0%
necessary and that is what our statute
 
02:14:01.030 --> 02:14:01.040 align:start position:0%
currently recognizes and I would submit
 
02:14:03.589 --> 02:14:03.599 align:start position:0%
that it should remain in place I do
 
02:14:05.229 --> 02:14:05.239 align:start position:0%
think there are more narrowly tailored
 
02:14:06.790 --> 02:14:06.800 align:start position:0%
ways to address some of this and I heard
 
02:14:09.470 --> 02:14:09.480 align:start position:0%
it earlier today which is get a family
 
02:14:11.270 --> 02:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
library card if you're a parent that is
 
02:14:14.030 --> 02:14:14.040 align:start position:0%
one way for parents to kind of monitor
 
02:14:17.030 --> 02:14:17.040 align:start position:0%
but this is far broader than uh than
 
02:14:18.910 --> 02:14:18.920 align:start position:0%
that and with that I'll I'll close my
 
02:14:21.390 --> 02:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you one thing M
 
02:14:24.709 --> 02:14:24.719 align:start position:0%
avocat that's Mr Advocate yes sir I I
 
02:14:26.390 --> 02:14:26.400 align:start position:0%
don't speak a lick of French but I I got
 
02:14:29.069 --> 02:14:29.079 align:start position:0%
that so I'll I'll speak in English for
 
02:14:33.270 --> 02:14:33.280 align:start position:0%
you be so um there was a situation and
 
02:14:35.470 --> 02:14:35.480 align:start position:0%
recently that caught my peripheral
 
02:14:40.030 --> 02:14:40.040 align:start position:0%
vision where a kid really was I mean he
 
02:14:43.350 --> 02:14:43.360 align:start position:0%
it was horrid what he did and people
 
02:14:43.360 --> 02:14:44.310 align:start position:0%
it was horrid what he did and people
said

02:14:44.310 --> 02:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
said
 
02:14:46.629 --> 02:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
well didn't the parents
 
02:14:50.310 --> 02:14:50.320 align:start position:0%
Monitor and they really didn't so he was
 
02:14:52.310 --> 02:14:52.320 align:start position:0%
downloading stuff and maybe checking out
 
02:14:56.109 --> 02:14:56.119 align:start position:0%
stuff and all kinds of Horrid stuff
 
02:14:59.510 --> 02:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
and gave him enough to know what to
 
02:15:03.629 --> 02:15:03.639 align:start position:0%
do for Mash casualties yeah so
 
02:15:06.750 --> 02:15:06.760 align:start position:0%
understood but your concern about a
 
02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
child who's not ready to talk to parents
 
02:15:12.350 --> 02:15:12.360 align:start position:0%
it goes across the ideological spectrum
 
02:15:14.350 --> 02:15:14.360 align:start position:0%
and it concerns me in both directions
 
02:15:16.990 --> 02:15:17.000 align:start position:0%
but you know when the question is well
 
02:15:19.430 --> 02:15:19.440 align:start position:0%
who was monitor ing what this child was
 
02:15:22.549 --> 02:15:22.559 align:start position:0%
inputting that speaks to this a bit uh
 
02:15:24.030 --> 02:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
sure I think the concern I have though
 
02:15:25.470 --> 02:15:25.480 align:start position:0%
is I think this bill goes far broader
 
02:15:26.910 --> 02:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
than that and there are more narrowly
 
02:15:28.990 --> 02:15:29.000 align:start position:0%
tailored ways to address those concerns
 
02:15:30.669 --> 02:15:30.679 align:start position:0%
than to just completely eliminate
 
02:15:32.549 --> 02:15:32.559 align:start position:0%
privacy altogether which is what I think
 
02:15:34.669 --> 02:15:34.679 align:start position:0%
this bill does so for example there's
 
02:15:36.510 --> 02:15:36.520 align:start position:0%
filtering software available right
 
02:15:38.149 --> 02:15:38.159 align:start position:0%
within School libraries I'm sure people
 
02:15:39.669 --> 02:15:39.679 align:start position:0%
behind me who are more equipped with
 
02:15:41.830 --> 02:15:41.840 align:start position:0%
libraries can talk about that and I want
 
02:15:43.430 --> 02:15:43.440 align:start position:0%
to get back to what I think is a more
 
02:15:45.350 --> 02:15:45.360 align:start position:0%
narrowly taad approach as well if you're
 
02:15:47.390 --> 02:15:47.400 align:start position:0%
a parent you know you want the ability
 
02:15:50.510 --> 02:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
to monitor your child's his uh uh
 
02:15:52.109 --> 02:15:52.119 align:start position:0%
history with respect to checking books
 
02:15:54.790 --> 02:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
out you have a family library card but
 
02:15:56.790 --> 02:15:56.800 align:start position:0%
this I think goes far beyond that which
 
02:15:58.229 --> 02:15:58.239 align:start position:0%
is the concern that we have at the end
 
02:16:00.109 --> 02:16:00.119 align:start position:0%
of the day thank you thank you
 
02:16:02.910 --> 02:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
02:16:07.069 --> 02:16:07.079 align:start position:0%
chairman uh so just briefly BR um
 
02:16:10.470 --> 02:16:10.480 align:start position:0%
scanning the handout that you gave out
 
02:16:12.350 --> 02:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
I'm under the impression and please
 
02:16:15.510 --> 02:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
correct me if I'm wrong that case law
 
02:16:18.709 --> 02:16:18.719 align:start position:0%
supports the current statute as it
 
02:16:20.790 --> 02:16:20.800 align:start position:0%
stands about
 
02:16:23.030 --> 02:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
confidentiality I I think that that is
 
02:16:25.830 --> 02:16:25.840 align:start position:0%
our position um what I would like to
 
02:16:27.709 --> 02:16:27.719 align:start position:0%
just flag again is the notion of
 
02:16:29.549 --> 02:16:29.559 align:start position:0%
intimate details of one's life which is
 
02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
the last section of um uh of our of Our
 
02:16:35.790 --> 02:16:35.800 align:start position:0%
Testimony right because that's what
 
02:16:37.389 --> 02:16:37.399 align:start position:0%
we're really dealing with here and which
 
02:16:40.509 --> 02:16:40.519 align:start position:0%
makes this so unique in other words if
 
02:16:44.270 --> 02:16:44.280 align:start position:0%
if we if we passed this bill then it
 
02:16:46.230 --> 02:16:46.240 align:start position:0%
would be an opposition of current case
 
02:16:49.030 --> 02:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
law um I think think because of the case
 
02:16:51.309 --> 02:16:51.319 align:start position:0%
law there could be legal concerns raised
 
02:16:52.870 --> 02:16:52.880 align:start position:0%
yes for all of the all the right to
 
02:16:54.910 --> 02:16:54.920 align:start position:0%
privacy reasons they articulated sure
 
02:16:54.920 --> 02:16:55.750 align:start position:0%
privacy reasons they articulated sure
thank

02:16:55.750 --> 02:16:55.760 align:start position:0%
thank
 
02:16:58.629 --> 02:16:58.639 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
02:17:01.190 --> 02:17:01.200 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you Mr chairman for allowing
 
02:17:03.309 --> 02:17:03.319 align:start position:0%
me to ask this question and thank you
 
02:17:05.669 --> 02:17:05.679 align:start position:0%
for allowing me to thank you
 
02:17:08.469 --> 02:17:08.479 align:start position:0%
representative okay um this might seem a
 
02:17:09.870 --> 02:17:09.880 align:start position:0%
little shocking what I'm going to say
 
02:17:12.910 --> 02:17:12.920 align:start position:0%
but in the libraries
 
02:17:17.030 --> 02:17:17.040 align:start position:0%
um it's our duty as a parent to oversee
 
02:17:19.270 --> 02:17:19.280 align:start position:0%
what our minor children are being
 
02:17:22.950 --> 02:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
exposed to and I think the concern that
 
02:17:24.349 --> 02:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
parents are
 
02:17:27.870 --> 02:17:27.880 align:start position:0%
having um and why this bill is being
 
02:17:31.589 --> 02:17:31.599 align:start position:0%
introduced is that um they're afraid
 
02:17:34.549 --> 02:17:34.559 align:start position:0%
that the children are being exposed to
 
02:17:38.830 --> 02:17:38.840 align:start position:0%
um grooming Miners and normalizing
 
02:17:43.309 --> 02:17:43.319 align:start position:0%
sexual behavior and for now um it's
 
02:17:47.629 --> 02:17:47.639 align:start position:0%
culturally ad considered adults only so
 
02:17:49.429 --> 02:17:49.439 align:start position:0%
there's supposed to be a certain
 
02:17:53.629 --> 02:17:53.639 align:start position:0%
maturity level to be able to access that
 
02:17:55.990 --> 02:17:56.000 align:start position:0%
information and I think with this bill
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
is trying to do
 
02:18:01.190 --> 02:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
is protect the innocent children until
 
02:18:03.750 --> 02:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
they're mature enough to make that
 
02:18:06.030 --> 02:18:06.040 align:start position:0%
decision without stripping away the
 
02:18:06.040 --> 02:18:08.230 align:start position:0%
decision without stripping away the
parents

02:18:08.230 --> 02:18:08.240 align:start position:0%
parents
 
02:18:11.389 --> 02:18:11.399 align:start position:0%
rights am I correct well I do have some
 
02:18:13.629 --> 02:18:13.639 align:start position:0%
comments to it um I I think you know
 
02:18:16.230 --> 02:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
again we're we're trying to balance two
 
02:18:18.230 --> 02:18:18.240 align:start position:0%
competing principles here right which is
 
02:18:20.549 --> 02:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
parental rights but all the notion too
 
02:18:23.509 --> 02:18:23.519 align:start position:0%
that I I think that minors especially
 
02:18:25.950 --> 02:18:25.960 align:start position:0%
teenagers have some privacy rights right
 
02:18:27.509 --> 02:18:27.519 align:start position:0%
with respect to the intimate details of
 
02:18:29.070 --> 02:18:29.080 align:start position:0%
their life including situations where
 
02:18:31.270 --> 02:18:31.280 align:start position:0%
the government may be collecting that
 
02:18:33.469 --> 02:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
information so I recognize the tension
 
02:18:34.870 --> 02:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
right that's why we're all kind of here
 
02:18:37.589 --> 02:18:37.599 align:start position:0%
wrestling with these these questions I
 
02:18:39.469 --> 02:18:39.479 align:start position:0%
think the the concern that I have is I
 
02:18:41.110 --> 02:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
think there are more narrowly tailored
 
02:18:43.469 --> 02:18:43.479 align:start position:0%
ways to address it rather than wholesale
 
02:18:45.389 --> 02:18:45.399 align:start position:0%
stripping privacy including the family
 
02:18:46.790 --> 02:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
library card which puts that in the
 
02:18:48.309 --> 02:18:48.319 align:start position:0%
hands of parents
 
02:18:50.070 --> 02:18:50.080 align:start position:0%
right but I do think as well with
 
02:18:52.150 --> 02:18:52.160 align:start position:0%
respect to obscene materials we have a
 
02:18:53.990 --> 02:18:54.000 align:start position:0%
harmful to minor statute right I would
 
02:18:56.150 --> 02:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
encourage folks to look at it um it's
 
02:18:56.160 --> 02:18:57.509 align:start position:0%
encourage folks to look at it um it's
RSA

02:18:57.509 --> 02:18:57.519 align:start position:0%
RSA
 
02:19:00.469 --> 02:19:00.479 align:start position:0%
571b um that that creates a process in
 
02:19:02.790 --> 02:19:02.800 align:start position:0%
place with respect to uh
 
02:19:04.750 --> 02:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
constitutionally unprotected material
 
02:19:06.469 --> 02:19:06.479 align:start position:0%
going in the hands of minor so I
 
02:19:08.629 --> 02:19:08.639 align:start position:0%
understand the concerns um I just think
 
02:19:10.549 --> 02:19:10.559 align:start position:0%
we have other laws in place to protect
 
02:19:12.309 --> 02:19:12.319 align:start position:0%
against it and my concern here is that
 
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
this bill is just too broad with respect
 
02:19:16.469 --> 02:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
to what it's intended to accomplish
 
02:19:18.509 --> 02:19:18.519 align:start position:0%
other question
 
02:19:20.549 --> 02:19:20.559 align:start position:0%

02:20:16.359 --> 03:22:47.389 align:start position:0%
 
overflow

03:22:47.389 --> 03:22:47.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:51.550 --> 03:22:51.560 align:start position:0%

afternoon I will open the hearing on
 
03:23:04.790 --> 03:23:04.800 align:start position:0%
cacr 25 I just did and asked the prime
 
03:23:07.389 --> 03:23:07.399 align:start position:0%
sponsor representative Hall to speak to
 
03:23:10.910 --> 03:23:10.920 align:start position:0%
it and then about after he has spoken to
 
03:23:14.630 --> 03:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
it and we have asked him any questions I

will put that into recess I will then
 
03:23:23.510 --> 03:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
open cacr 17 and ask the prime sponsor

representative cordelli to speak to
 
03:23:30.990 --> 03:23:31.000 align:start position:0%

hearings will be conducted
 
03:23:36.510 --> 03:23:36.520 align:start position:0%

an amendment I will explain that during
 
03:24:35.760 --> 03:24:37.389 align:start position:0%

my
 
03:24:40.349 --> 03:24:40.359 align:start position:0%
testimony um I believe there was also a
 
03:24:43.110 --> 03:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
copy of a memorandum from that someone
 
03:24:45.150 --> 03:24:45.160 align:start position:0%
has requested probably the chairman
 
03:24:48.670 --> 03:24:48.680 align:start position:0%
relative to Amendments of this style
 
03:24:51.189 --> 03:24:51.199 align:start position:0%
over the last two decades thank you
 
03:24:54.030 --> 03:24:54.040 align:start position:0%
chairman um W I mean I'm only as good as
 
03:24:56.670 --> 03:24:56.680 align:start position:0%
my research staff who is very good thank
 
03:24:59.590 --> 03:24:59.600 align:start position:0%
you research staff so I I believe
 
03:25:03.389 --> 03:25:03.399 align:start position:0%
there's actually um several others that
 
03:25:05.870 --> 03:25:05.880 align:start position:0%
um we can add to the list that is is
 
03:25:07.550 --> 03:25:07.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned in that
 
03:25:11.670 --> 03:25:11.680 align:start position:0%
memorandum um let me pull up my notes uh
 
03:25:17.830 --> 03:25:17.840 align:start position:0%
um 2018 CAC R14 2017 cacr 2 2016 CAC R16
 
03:25:21.950 --> 03:25:21.960 align:start position:0%
2024 and 2 uh sorry 2010 cacr
 
03:25:27.950 --> 03:25:27.960 align:start position:0%
29 um 2012 cacr 31 2013 cacr
 
03:25:31.830 --> 03:25:31.840 align:start position:0%
3 the list goes on I'm not saying that
 
03:25:31.840 --> 03:25:32.230 align:start position:0%
3 the list goes on I'm not saying that
it's

03:25:32.230 --> 03:25:32.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
03:25:32.240 --> 03:25:33.349 align:start position:0%
it's
[Music]

03:25:33.349 --> 03:25:33.359 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:25:36.150 --> 03:25:36.160 align:start position:0%
not that we have failed a number of
 
03:25:38.790 --> 03:25:38.800 align:start position:0%
times we have put this amendment forward
 
03:25:41.670 --> 03:25:41.680 align:start position:0%
because we believe as a society that the
 
03:25:44.630 --> 03:25:44.640 align:start position:0%
predominant role of parents is to take
 
03:25:46.269 --> 03:25:46.279 align:start position:0%
care of their children that should be
 
03:25:48.990 --> 03:25:49.000 align:start position:0%
the first thing that we look to not the
 
03:25:52.830 --> 03:25:52.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:55.030 --> 03:25:55.040 align:start position:0%
organization I'm on probably three or
 
03:25:56.910 --> 03:25:56.920 align:start position:0%
four of those amendments that I I
 
03:26:00.630 --> 03:26:00.640 align:start position:0%
mentioned just now the bottom line is
 
03:26:02.710 --> 03:26:02.720 align:start position:0%
who is the first person to take care of
 
03:26:06.070 --> 03:26:06.080 align:start position:0%
a minor child the bill has introduced
 
03:26:08.150 --> 03:26:08.160 align:start position:0%
puts in a conditional
 
03:26:11.469 --> 03:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
phrase and we had discussions amongst a
 
03:26:12.790 --> 03:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
number of outside
 
03:26:15.429 --> 03:26:15.439 align:start position:0%
groups and there were concerns that the
 
03:26:16.950 --> 03:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
conditional phrase could create
 
03:26:16.960 --> 03:26:18.950 align:start position:0%
conditional phrase could create
unintended

03:26:18.950 --> 03:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
unintended
 
03:26:21.710 --> 03:26:21.720 align:start position:0%
consequences at their request I updated
 
03:26:23.269 --> 03:26:23.279 align:start position:0%
the draft to be something that has been
 
03:26:25.429 --> 03:26:25.439 align:start position:0%
filed multiple times before and has
 
03:26:27.710 --> 03:26:27.720 align:start position:0%
received positive recommendations um
 
03:26:29.510 --> 03:26:29.520 align:start position:0%
from outside organizations and has gone
 
03:26:32.309 --> 03:26:32.319 align:start position:0%
to the floor which is the verbatim to
 
03:26:36.469 --> 03:26:36.479 align:start position:0%
cacr 9 of of 2011 and it occurs a couple
 
03:26:38.229 --> 03:26:38.239 align:start position:0%
other times I think it was also verbatim
 
03:26:40.870 --> 03:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
in 2013 parents have the natural right
 
03:26:42.229 --> 03:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
to control the health education and
 
03:26:44.670 --> 03:26:44.680 align:start position:0%
Welfare of their
 
03:26:47.990 --> 03:26:48.000 align:start position:0%
children it's a simple Amendment do we
 
03:26:50.910 --> 03:26:50.920 align:start position:0%
believe that parents should be the First
 
03:26:53.590 --> 03:26:53.600 align:start position:0%
Responders in raising children or should
 
03:26:54.830 --> 03:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
we look
 
03:26:54.840 --> 03:26:56.550 align:start position:0%
we look
elsewhere

03:26:56.550 --> 03:26:56.560 align:start position:0%
elsewhere
 
03:27:00.750 --> 03:27:00.760 align:start position:0%
um a number of times the state is has
 
03:27:02.429 --> 03:27:02.439 align:start position:0%
gotten involved with
 
03:27:04.349 --> 03:27:04.359 align:start position:0%
families and there's been serious
 
03:27:07.150 --> 03:27:07.160 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences of that
 
03:27:09.269 --> 03:27:09.279 align:start position:0%
involvement this would remedy that this
 
03:27:11.910 --> 03:27:11.920 align:start position:0%
would give the the the parent who have
 
03:27:14.910 --> 03:27:14.920 align:start position:0%
been had their lives intruded into a
 
03:27:16.830 --> 03:27:16.840 align:start position:0%
chance to say look you're violating my
 
03:27:16.840 --> 03:27:18.630 align:start position:0%
chance to say look you're violating my
constitutional

03:27:18.630 --> 03:27:18.640 align:start position:0%
constitutional
 
03:27:21.189 --> 03:27:21.199 align:start position:0%
rights there's a reason this bill in
 
03:27:23.870 --> 03:27:23.880 align:start position:0%
some form has come up basically every
 
03:27:27.269 --> 03:27:27.279 align:start position:0%
year since at least 2008 we may have
 
03:27:29.830 --> 03:27:29.840 align:start position:0%
missed one or two legislative Cycles but
 
03:27:31.510 --> 03:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
in one form or another in either the
 
03:27:34.349 --> 03:27:34.359 align:start position:0%
house or the Senate it has come up it is
 
03:27:36.710 --> 03:27:36.720 align:start position:0%
that important to the families in this
 
03:27:40.189 --> 03:27:40.199 align:start position:0%
state so I would ask that you take the
 
03:27:42.950 --> 03:27:42.960 align:start position:0%
amendment that I have handed out today
 
03:27:45.189 --> 03:27:45.199 align:start position:0%
and offer that as during your exec
 
03:27:46.990 --> 03:27:47.000 align:start position:0%
session on this
 
03:27:51.469 --> 03:27:51.479 align:start position:0%
bill um I do recommend that only either
 
03:27:57.710 --> 03:27:57.720 align:start position:0%
cacr 17 or cacr 25 go forward I am not
 
03:28:00.790 --> 03:28:00.800 align:start position:0%
I'm not wetted to either one in terms of
 
03:28:03.630 --> 03:28:03.640 align:start position:0%
who sponsored it I do think this
 
03:28:06.030 --> 03:28:06.040 align:start position:0%
language is right in this amendment that
 
03:28:08.830 --> 03:28:08.840 align:start position:0%
I have before you is actually a cleaner
 
03:28:10.469 --> 03:28:10.479 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment to lay a
 
03:28:12.229 --> 03:28:12.239 align:start position:0%
foundation for the role of parents
 
03:28:16.550 --> 03:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
within our society than the ones that
 
03:28:19.910 --> 03:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
are in either 17 or the cacr 25 as I
 
03:28:22.229 --> 03:28:22.239 align:start position:0%
filed it representative I think I know
 
03:28:24.229 --> 03:28:24.239 align:start position:0%
why you would rather have one or the
 
03:28:25.870 --> 03:28:25.880 align:start position:0%
other but not both but could you
 
03:28:27.950 --> 03:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
articulate that for those of us who
 
03:28:31.630 --> 03:28:31.640 align:start position:0%
aren't sure sure so it would
 
03:28:34.429 --> 03:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
be it would be weird to have both on the
 
03:28:36.830 --> 03:28:36.840 align:start position:0%
ballot if it made it that far in the
 
03:28:39.189 --> 03:28:39.199 align:start position:0%
process I don't think that would do
 
03:28:41.830 --> 03:28:41.840 align:start position:0%
justice the citizens might accept both
 
03:28:43.510 --> 03:28:43.520 align:start position:0%
of them and they might be somewhat
 
03:28:45.590 --> 03:28:45.600 align:start position:0%
confli slight there might be slight
 
03:28:47.990 --> 03:28:48.000 align:start position:0%
conflicts in nature I think the better
 
03:28:50.670 --> 03:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
process and I I I love I don't care who
 
03:28:52.750 --> 03:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
sponsors it at the end of the day I
 
03:28:55.469 --> 03:28:55.479 align:start position:0%
would like to see the language change so
 
03:28:58.630 --> 03:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
if one gets with retained in committee
 
03:29:00.429 --> 03:29:00.439 align:start position:0%
or in from studied and the other one
 
03:29:03.229 --> 03:29:03.239 align:start position:0%
goes forward that's fine with me I'm not
 
03:29:05.550 --> 03:29:05.560 align:start position:0%
married to the sponsorship I'm married
 
03:29:08.429 --> 03:29:08.439 align:start position:0%
to one to my wife
 
03:29:12.710 --> 03:29:12.720 align:start position:0%
but I would like to see the language of
 
03:29:15.670 --> 03:29:15.680 align:start position:0%
the amendment go forward because I
 
03:29:17.870 --> 03:29:17.880 align:start position:0%
believe this amendment has been vetted
 
03:29:20.710 --> 03:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
the most times um in terms of actually
 
03:29:24.269 --> 03:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
coming before the house um I can provide
 
03:29:25.990 --> 03:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
to your researcher the list of other
 
03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:27.840 align:start position:0%
times that this exact language has come
 
03:29:30.150 --> 03:29:30.160 align:start position:0%
up I believe this is either the fifth or
 
03:29:32.309 --> 03:29:32.319 align:start position:0%
the sixth version of this so there's a
 
03:29:35.510 --> 03:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
lot of history relative to any
 
03:29:38.030 --> 03:29:38.040 align:start position:0%
unintended consequences have been vetted
 
03:29:40.830 --> 03:29:40.840 align:start position:0%
in the Committees it's been on the floor
 
03:29:43.389 --> 03:29:43.399 align:start position:0%
but passing the necessary three fists on
 
03:29:45.710 --> 03:29:45.720 align:start position:0%
the floor in a divided house is
 
03:29:45.720 --> 03:29:47.110 align:start position:0%
the floor in a divided house is
sometimes

03:29:47.110 --> 03:29:47.120 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
03:29:49.550 --> 03:29:49.560 align:start position:0%
difficult um with that I'll close my
 
03:29:52.150 --> 03:29:52.160 align:start position:0%
testimony unless there's any
 
03:29:52.160 --> 03:29:54.030 align:start position:0%
testimony unless there's any
questions

03:29:54.030 --> 03:29:54.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:29:57.670 --> 03:29:57.680 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons thank you uh Mr
 
03:30:00.309 --> 03:30:00.319 align:start position:0%
chairman uh what kind of unintended
 
03:30:02.830 --> 03:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
consequences might you expect from this
 
03:30:06.630 --> 03:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
bill so the question it's worded oh well
 
03:30:09.469 --> 03:30:09.479 align:start position:0%
Bill as it's worded or the
 
03:30:11.429 --> 03:30:11.439 align:start position:0%
amendment I'd rather speak to the
 
03:30:13.429 --> 03:30:13.439 align:start position:0%
amendment than the original Bill the
 
03:30:15.469 --> 03:30:15.479 align:start position:0%
amendment okay so the original Bill had
 
03:30:18.150 --> 03:30:18.160 align:start position:0%
this if then therefore type clause and
 
03:30:20.870 --> 03:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
you can create legal loopholes and I
 
03:30:22.630 --> 03:30:22.640 align:start position:0%
don't want to necessarily go there
 
03:30:24.150 --> 03:30:24.160 align:start position:0%
various legal groups looked at it and
 
03:30:27.229 --> 03:30:27.239 align:start position:0%
said that could be problematic this year
 
03:30:29.349 --> 03:30:29.359 align:start position:0%
I don't see any major unintended
 
03:30:31.870 --> 03:30:31.880 align:start position:0%
consequences if parents forfeit their
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
rights by their actions in terms of
 
03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:36.120 align:start position:0%
taking care of their children or
 
03:30:37.870 --> 03:30:37.880 align:start position:0%
neglecting to take care of their
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
children or abusing their children
 
03:30:43.590 --> 03:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
they've done some Criminal act that is
 
03:30:45.590 --> 03:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
then puts them in forfeiture that's no
 
03:30:46.990 --> 03:30:47.000 align:start position:0%
different than our constitutional
 
03:30:49.590 --> 03:30:49.600 align:start position:0%
amendments relative to let's say the
 
03:30:51.429 --> 03:30:51.439 align:start position:0%
Second Amendment the second amendment
 
03:30:53.830 --> 03:30:53.840 align:start position:0%
guarantees rights regarding Firearms but
 
03:30:55.510 --> 03:30:55.520 align:start position:0%
if someone's committed an act that
 
03:30:57.389 --> 03:30:57.399 align:start position:0%
Society is deemed
 
03:30:59.990 --> 03:31:00.000 align:start position:0%
unacceptable that that
 
03:31:02.189 --> 03:31:02.199 align:start position:0%
constitutional provision doesn't apply
 
03:31:06.030 --> 03:31:06.040 align:start position:0%
anymore because the the person has done
 
03:31:07.510 --> 03:31:07.520 align:start position:0%
something that we as a society have
 
03:31:10.030 --> 03:31:10.040 align:start position:0%
deemed unacceptable I would say criminal
 
03:31:12.510 --> 03:31:12.520 align:start position:0%
acts against children clearly fall in
 
03:31:14.790 --> 03:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
that section and even though there
 
03:31:16.189 --> 03:31:16.199 align:start position:0%
there's a constitutional amendment that
 
03:31:18.389 --> 03:31:18.399 align:start position:0%
would allow this to go forward someone
 
03:31:20.309 --> 03:31:20.319 align:start position:0%
could still prosecute a parent for
 
03:31:26.309 --> 03:31:26.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:28.389 --> 03:31:28.399 align:start position:0%
child just a
 
03:31:30.670 --> 03:31:30.680 align:start position:0%
clarification although we do have this
 
03:31:32.189 --> 03:31:32.199 align:start position:0%
amendment in front of us you cannot
 
03:31:35.309 --> 03:31:35.319 align:start position:0%
speak to it directly because it is not
 
03:31:38.110 --> 03:31:38.120 align:start position:0%
beneficially presented uh you can speak
 
03:31:40.630 --> 03:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
to the broad philosophies and and
 
03:31:44.469 --> 03:31:44.479 align:start position:0%
thoughts and so on making a an illusion
 
03:31:47.750 --> 03:31:47.760 align:start position:0%
allusion to where you're going okay yes
 
03:31:47.760 --> 03:31:50.870 align:start position:0%
allusion to where you're going okay yes
representative

03:31:50.870 --> 03:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:53.429 --> 03:31:53.439 align:start position:0%
Petrino thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:31:54.830 --> 03:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
03:31:56.630 --> 03:31:56.640 align:start position:0%
question there's been a lot of talk
 
03:31:58.229 --> 03:31:58.239 align:start position:0%
about parental rights these last few
 
03:32:00.630 --> 03:32:00.640 align:start position:0%
years so of course like many I've done a
 
03:32:02.229 --> 03:32:02.239 align:start position:0%
little bit of research and I was
 
03:32:06.229 --> 03:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
surprised to see that uh at least
 
03:32:09.389 --> 03:32:09.399 align:start position:0%
14 United States Supreme Court rulings
 
03:32:11.590 --> 03:32:11.600 align:start position:0%
affirming the constitutional right
 
03:32:13.670 --> 03:32:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh of parents to direct uh the
 
03:32:15.630 --> 03:32:15.640 align:start position:0%
upbringing the education and the care of
 
03:32:19.389 --> 03:32:19.399 align:start position:0%
their child um so I'm
 
03:32:23.830 --> 03:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
wondering if this would add anything to
 
03:32:27.429 --> 03:32:27.439 align:start position:0%
existing parental rights which again
 
03:32:30.150 --> 03:32:30.160 align:start position:0%
I've I've I've I've seen at least 14
 
03:32:31.830 --> 03:32:31.840 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases going all the way
 
03:32:34.990 --> 03:32:35.000 align:start position:0%
back to 1920 which again and again and
 
03:32:38.389 --> 03:32:38.399 align:start position:0%
again affirms parental rights AB
 
03:32:39.950 --> 03:32:39.960 align:start position:0%
absolutely I do think it would add
 
03:32:42.750 --> 03:32:42.760 align:start position:0%
something the Supreme Court has ruled
 
03:32:43.870 --> 03:32:43.880 align:start position:0%
that parents do have the rights
 
03:32:45.469 --> 03:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
especially when it comes to education
 
03:32:49.150 --> 03:32:49.160 align:start position:0%
it's clear um maybe not quite as clear
 
03:32:52.790 --> 03:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
when it comes to General Welfare or
 
03:32:55.670 --> 03:32:55.680 align:start position:0%
health but definitely when it comes to
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
um education Pierce I think it was an
 
03:33:00.189 --> 03:33:00.199 align:start position:0%
early 1900s
 
03:33:04.309 --> 03:33:04.319 align:start position:0%
case um in particular I think this sets
 
03:33:07.269 --> 03:33:07.279 align:start position:0%
the bar that parents are the first
 
03:33:09.349 --> 03:33:09.359 align:start position:0%
accountable party to taking care of
 
03:33:11.309 --> 03:33:11.319 align:start position:0%
their children if they're doing
 
03:33:13.950 --> 03:33:13.960 align:start position:0%
right and there's an if in there right
 
03:33:15.510 --> 03:33:15.520 align:start position:0%
then they should be allowed to continue
 
03:33:17.790 --> 03:33:17.800 align:start position:0%
what they're doing if they are making
 
03:33:20.990 --> 03:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
choices that create harm to the child
 
03:33:22.630 --> 03:33:22.640 align:start position:0%
children that's a different story but
 
03:33:23.870 --> 03:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're not talking about that we're
 
03:33:25.990 --> 03:33:26.000 align:start position:0%
setting the the the foundation for the
 
03:33:29.790 --> 03:33:29.800 align:start position:0%
proper role of of within a
 
03:33:32.110 --> 03:33:32.120 align:start position:0%
family so I think it does add to the
 
03:33:33.670 --> 03:33:33.680 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court especially when it comes
 
03:33:36.269 --> 03:33:36.279 align:start position:0%
to health decisions because nowadays is
 
03:33:38.870 --> 03:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
it acceptable for instance to choose to
 
03:33:42.389 --> 03:33:42.399 align:start position:0%
to delay a vaccination schedule
 
03:33:43.550 --> 03:33:43.560 align:start position:0%
one could think that the state's going
 
03:33:45.229 --> 03:33:45.239 align:start position:0%
to get involved and say no you have to
 
03:33:47.030 --> 03:33:47.040 align:start position:0%
follow the the vaccination schedule
 
03:33:50.269 --> 03:33:50.279 align:start position:0%
exactly well it is there's enough doubt
 
03:33:51.910 --> 03:33:51.920 align:start position:0%
in some of those vaccinations that
 
03:33:53.830 --> 03:33:53.840 align:start position:0%
parents especially in the autism
 
03:33:56.229 --> 03:33:56.239 align:start position:0%
spectrum of right are a little bit
 
03:33:58.550 --> 03:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
concerned so delaying it might actually
 
03:34:00.389 --> 03:34:00.399 align:start position:0%
be a good thing for the best in terms of
 
03:34:06.750 --> 03:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:09.670 --> 03:34:09.680 align:start position:0%
child representative
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr
 
03:34:15.269 --> 03:34:15.279 align:start position:0%
chairman would it be helpful if um one
 
03:34:18.110 --> 03:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
of us introduced the amendment now or
 
03:34:21.550 --> 03:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:34:26.229 --> 03:34:26.239 align:start position:0%
time it has to be during executive
 
03:34:26.239 --> 03:34:28.189 align:start position:0%
time it has to be during executive
okay

03:34:28.189 --> 03:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:34:31.830 --> 03:34:31.840 align:start position:0%
um it' be helpful but we can't do
 
03:34:34.189 --> 03:34:34.199 align:start position:0%
it good
 
03:34:37.349 --> 03:34:37.359 align:start position:0%
point um I I I guess my my question to
 
03:34:39.990 --> 03:34:40.000 align:start position:0%
you is along the same lines can you you
 
03:34:41.710 --> 03:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
mentioned fact ations there's any other
 
03:34:44.269 --> 03:34:44.279 align:start position:0%
things you can think of that uh we would
 
03:34:45.910 --> 03:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
want to go forward with this I think
 
03:34:47.630 --> 03:34:47.640 align:start position:0%
examples would be very
 
03:34:51.229 --> 03:34:51.239 align:start position:0%
helpful so there's enough doubt in the
 
03:34:54.030 --> 03:34:54.040 align:start position:0%
medical community today what is the
 
03:34:56.990 --> 03:34:57.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate course of action relative to
 
03:34:57.000 --> 03:34:58.630 align:start position:0%
appropriate course of action relative to
various

03:34:58.630 --> 03:34:58.640 align:start position:0%
various
 
03:34:58.640 --> 03:35:00.269 align:start position:0%
various
treatments

03:35:00.269 --> 03:35:00.279 align:start position:0%
treatments
 
03:35:03.590 --> 03:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
um that looking to parents to be the
 
03:35:05.910 --> 03:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
first right parents and their doctors to
 
03:35:08.590 --> 03:35:08.600 align:start position:0%
be the first person to talk to and be
 
03:35:11.030 --> 03:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
responsible as opposed to the state and
 
03:35:11.040 --> 03:35:11.990 align:start position:0%
responsible as opposed to the state and
the

03:35:11.990 --> 03:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:35:14.870 --> 03:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
doctors is a good
 
03:35:17.469 --> 03:35:17.479 align:start position:0%
thing um I could imagine for instance
 
03:35:19.790 --> 03:35:19.800 align:start position:0%
where some some medical provider says
 
03:35:22.550 --> 03:35:22.560 align:start position:0%
that's that's a bad thing to and kicks
 
03:35:26.269 --> 03:35:26.279 align:start position:0%
off a dcyf incident I I've sat before
 
03:35:28.150 --> 03:35:28.160 align:start position:0%
this committee at least once on a
 
03:35:30.790 --> 03:35:30.800 align:start position:0%
medication that was provided worldwide
 
03:35:33.389 --> 03:35:33.399 align:start position:0%
multiple billions of times and has less
 
03:35:36.469 --> 03:35:36.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.229 --> 03:35:39.239 align:start position:0%
Ibuprofen yet that was enough to
 
03:35:43.870 --> 03:35:43.880 align:start position:0%
trigger um a dcyf investigation so I
 
03:35:45.590 --> 03:35:45.600 align:start position:0%
think there's real value in looking to
 
03:35:48.990 --> 03:35:49.000 align:start position:0%
parents to guide and and own the
 
03:35:52.070 --> 03:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility for education for medical
 
03:35:55.830 --> 03:35:55.840 align:start position:0%
choices as well as for um the overall
 
03:35:57.910 --> 03:35:57.920 align:start position:0%
welfare of the child children now when
 
03:35:59.870 --> 03:35:59.880 align:start position:0%
they become right hit the age of
 
03:36:01.590 --> 03:36:01.600 align:start position:0%
majority that's a different thing and we
 
03:36:03.870 --> 03:36:03.880 align:start position:0%
as a society have chosen that 18 is the
 
03:36:06.229 --> 03:36:06.239 align:start position:0%
age where that happens but up until
 
03:36:08.630 --> 03:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
18 the responsible thing to do would be
 
03:36:11.429 --> 03:36:11.439 align:start position:0%
to look to the parents does that answer
 
03:36:11.439 --> 03:36:13.070 align:start position:0%
to look to the parents does that answer
your

03:36:13.070 --> 03:36:13.080 align:start position:0%
your
 
03:36:16.630 --> 03:36:16.640 align:start position:0%
question well the followup thank you Mr
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
chairman um what you said so far is in
 
03:36:22.990 --> 03:36:23.000 align:start position:0%
consultation with a medical doctor but
 
03:36:25.150 --> 03:36:25.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't say that
 
03:36:28.830 --> 03:36:28.840 align:start position:0%
here in the bill or either so when we're
 
03:36:31.189 --> 03:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
dealing with ccrs we're not dealing
 
03:36:34.590 --> 03:36:34.600 align:start position:0%
necessarily with the level of exactness
 
03:36:36.110 --> 03:36:36.120 align:start position:0%
that you would write a statute these are
 
03:36:38.710 --> 03:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
guiding principles for how we as a state
 
03:36:41.269 --> 03:36:41.279 align:start position:0%
want to have our society
 
03:36:42.870 --> 03:36:42.880 align:start position:0%
often times this would be in the Bill of
 
03:36:46.590 --> 03:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
Rights these are there these sections of
 
03:36:49.830 --> 03:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
part first are there to restrain
 
03:36:52.070 --> 03:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
government to not step over certain
 
03:36:54.830 --> 03:36:54.840 align:start position:0%
lines so our constitution is structured
 
03:36:56.150 --> 03:36:56.160 align:start position:0%
part first is kind of the bill of right
 
03:36:57.630 --> 03:36:57.640 align:start position:0%
section this talks about the rights that
 
03:36:59.790 --> 03:36:59.800 align:start position:0%
the citizens have prior to the

Bill of Rights and it would be the
 
03:37:10.510 --> 03:37:10.520 align:start position:0%
foundation for legislation in the future
 
03:37:12.429 --> 03:37:12.439 align:start position:0%

03:39:10.469 --> 03:39:10.479 align:start position:0%
sentence Constitutional Amendment what
 
03:39:14.469 --> 03:39:14.479 align:start position:0%
passed around is the statutory Supreme
 
03:39:14.479 --> 03:39:15.590 align:start position:0%

Court
 
03:39:18.990 --> 03:39:19.000 align:start position:0%
references from multiple cases from
 
03:39:22.990 --> 03:39:23.000 align:start position:0%
which I drew language for this
 
03:39:23.000 --> 03:39:24.990 align:start position:0%
which I drew language for this
Constitutional

03:39:24.990 --> 03:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
Constitutional
 
03:39:25.000 --> 03:39:27.870 align:start position:0%
Constitutional
Amendment

03:39:27.870 --> 03:39:27.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:39:31.750 --> 03:39:31.760 align:start position:0%
um starting with the first sentence
 
03:39:35.429 --> 03:39:35.439 align:start position:0%
about parents having the fundamental
 
03:39:38.269 --> 03:39:38.279 align:start position:0%
right and responsibility for the
 
03:39:42.750 --> 03:39:42.760 align:start position:0%
upbringing of their children um I cite
 
03:39:47.070 --> 03:39:47.080 align:start position:0%
uh six five or six different Supreme
 
03:39:50.189 --> 03:39:50.199 align:start position:0%
Court decisions with much the same
 
03:39:54.990 --> 03:39:55.000 align:start position:0%
language as I have um in my uh
 
03:39:58.150 --> 03:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
proposal um one in particular I wanted
 
03:40:00.070 --> 03:40:00.080 align:start position:0%
to bring your attention to is number
 
03:40:02.670 --> 03:40:02.680 align:start position:0%
three Pierce Versus Society of
 
03:40:06.550 --> 03:40:06.560 align:start position:0%
sisters um it was an Oregon uh situation
 
03:40:08.590 --> 03:40:08.600 align:start position:0%
where they had passed a law that all
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
children had to go to public school
 
03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
schools uh the Society of sisters and
 
03:40:16.429 --> 03:40:16.439 align:start position:0%
several private schools um filed suit
 
03:40:18.309 --> 03:40:18.319 align:start position:0%
and it went to the Supreme
 
03:40:22.229 --> 03:40:22.239 align:start position:0%
Court um in that decision by the Supreme
 
03:40:24.870 --> 03:40:24.880 align:start position:0%
Court the child is not a mere creature
 
03:40:27.670 --> 03:40:27.680 align:start position:0%
of the state those who nurture him and
 
03:40:30.429 --> 03:40:30.439 align:start position:0%
direct his Destiny have the right
 
03:40:33.110 --> 03:40:33.120 align:start position:0%
coupled with the high duty to recognize
 
03:40:35.830 --> 03:40:35.840 align:start position:0%
and prepare him for future
 
03:40:39.309 --> 03:40:39.319 align:start position:0%
obligations um you'll see in the other
 
03:40:41.110 --> 03:40:41.120 align:start position:0%
uh situation excuse me the other uh
 
03:40:43.269 --> 03:40:43.279 align:start position:0%
language from other supreme courtes
 
03:40:46.309 --> 03:40:46.319 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court cases um very similar
 
03:40:48.550 --> 03:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
language to what I have
 
03:40:50.910 --> 03:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
proposed the second
 
03:40:52.990 --> 03:40:53.000 align:start position:0%
sentence relates
 
03:40:55.469 --> 03:40:55.479 align:start position:0%
to government
 
03:40:57.870 --> 03:40:57.880 align:start position:0%
infringement um you hear heard some
 
03:41:02.550 --> 03:41:02.560 align:start position:0%
conversation about that U moments ago so
 
03:41:04.590 --> 03:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
specifically I address that in this
 
03:41:04.600 --> 03:41:05.830 align:start position:0%
specifically I address that in this
Constitutional

03:41:05.830 --> 03:41:05.840 align:start position:0%
Constitutional
 
03:41:10.269 --> 03:41:10.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment that in order to for the
 
03:41:13.830 --> 03:41:13.840 align:start position:0%
government to infringe on parental
 
03:41:16.469 --> 03:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
rights there has to be a compelling
 
03:41:19.950 --> 03:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
interest and it has to be of the highest
 
03:41:23.349 --> 03:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
order for the government to get involved
 
03:41:26.870 --> 03:41:26.880 align:start position:0%
and that um is referenced in four excuse
 
03:41:30.349 --> 03:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
me three different Supreme Court cases
 
03:41:33.429 --> 03:41:33.439 align:start position:0%
um notable Supreme Court cases are
 
03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
Washington versus glurg and Troxel
 
03:41:39.910 --> 03:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
versus Granville um as recently as 2000
 
03:41:41.910 --> 03:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
uh um the first reference you'll see is
 
03:41:45.469 --> 03:41:45.479 align:start position:0%
to a uh Constitutional Amendment uh that
 
03:41:49.349 --> 03:41:49.359 align:start position:0%
was proposed in the 113th Congress that
 
03:41:51.389 --> 03:41:51.399 align:start position:0%
uh did not make it all the way uh
 
03:41:53.389 --> 03:41:53.399 align:start position:0%
through the process but I thought that
 
03:41:57.830 --> 03:41:57.840 align:start position:0%
the language in that um proposal was um
 
03:42:00.349 --> 03:42:00.359 align:start position:0%
very applicable to the Supreme Court
 
03:42:02.670 --> 03:42:02.680 align:start position:0%
decisions and what I wanted to include
 
03:42:03.950 --> 03:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
in my
 
03:42:07.030 --> 03:42:07.040 align:start position:0%
proposal and the third
 
03:42:10.870 --> 03:42:10.880 align:start position:0%
sentence um was developed from the that
 
03:42:13.189 --> 03:42:13.199 align:start position:0%
uh Constitutional Amendment proposed
 
03:42:16.269 --> 03:42:16.279 align:start position:0%
before the 113th Congress as well as
 
03:42:19.830 --> 03:42:19.840 align:start position:0%
working with a local lawyer and it is
 
03:42:23.670 --> 03:42:23.680 align:start position:0%
intended to say that um this
 
03:42:27.389 --> 03:42:27.399 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendment shall not apply
 
03:42:30.830 --> 03:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
to any parental action that would abuse
 
03:42:34.990 --> 03:42:35.000 align:start position:0%
or harm the child to answer questions
 
03:42:38.510 --> 03:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
that were previously asked so I tried to
 
03:42:42.110 --> 03:42:42.120 align:start position:0%
cover a number of bases um with this
 
03:42:44.590 --> 03:42:44.600 align:start position:0%
simple three sentence Constitutional
 
03:42:48.269 --> 03:42:48.279 align:start position:0%
Amendment and um uh I did a lot of
 
03:42:53.830 --> 03:42:53.840 align:start position:0%
research into constitutional cases um um
 
03:42:58.110 --> 03:42:58.120 align:start position:0%
related to parental rights and um have
 
03:43:01.830 --> 03:43:01.840 align:start position:0%
um made them available for your um
 
03:43:04.950 --> 03:43:04.960 align:start position:0%
review and I would also just add that um
 
03:43:10.469 --> 03:43:10.479 align:start position:0%
I did run this by um a uh well-known
 
03:43:13.750 --> 03:43:13.760 align:start position:0%
um legal firm the alliance for defending
 
03:43:16.870 --> 03:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
Freedom um and uh they have worked on a
 
03:43:20.349 --> 03:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
number of um parental rights cases and
 
03:43:23.429 --> 03:43:23.439 align:start position:0%
um their review said and I quote the
 
03:43:26.429 --> 03:43:26.439 align:start position:0%
amendment language looks very strong to
 
03:43:32.830 --> 03:43:32.840 align:start position:0%
us um so that is my proposal and uh I
 
03:43:35.030 --> 03:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
welcome any
 
03:43:38.870 --> 03:43:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:41.229 --> 03:43:41.239 align:start position:0%
Petrino thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:43:42.590 --> 03:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
03:43:44.750 --> 03:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
question and I do appreciate the fact
 
03:43:47.070 --> 03:43:47.080 align:start position:0%
that you had submitted some excerpts
 
03:43:50.070 --> 03:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
from various Supreme Court cases so
 
03:43:53.189 --> 03:43:53.199 align:start position:0%
similar to what I previously asked is
 
03:43:55.830 --> 03:43:55.840 align:start position:0%
there anything uh in this Constitutional
 
03:43:59.070 --> 03:43:59.080 align:start position:0%
Amendment proposed that would do
 
03:44:00.670 --> 03:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
anything more than what the United
 
03:44:02.870 --> 03:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
States Supreme Court has affirmed again
 
03:44:05.429 --> 03:44:05.439 align:start position:0%
and again and again that parental rights
 
03:44:08.910 --> 03:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
in fact do exist Does this add anything
 
03:44:14.309 --> 03:44:14.319 align:start position:0%
to what is our in uh case law the excuse
 
03:44:18.590 --> 03:44:18.600 align:start position:0%
me um I I think that I tried to combine
 
03:44:20.910 --> 03:44:20.920 align:start position:0%
sections from multiple Supreme Court
 
03:44:24.710 --> 03:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
cases into one simple um paragraph for
 
03:44:27.030 --> 03:44:27.040 align:start position:0%
our constitution as you can see by the
 
03:44:29.630 --> 03:44:29.640 align:start position:0%
dates in these these issues keep coming
 
03:44:31.910 --> 03:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
up even all the way up to the Supreme
 
03:44:35.429 --> 03:44:35.439 align:start position:0%
Court um so I wanted to try and put as
 
03:44:38.349 --> 03:44:38.359 align:start position:0%
much into a simple Amendment here for
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
our constitution um to avoid any um
 
03:44:47.149 --> 03:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
future um uh issues that might relate uh
 
03:44:50.630 --> 03:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
or cause a case from New Hampshire uh
 
03:44:52.910 --> 03:44:52.920 align:start position:0%
related to paranal rights making it back
 
03:44:55.309 --> 03:44:55.319 align:start position:0%
up to the Supreme Court again quick
 
03:44:55.319 --> 03:44:56.269 align:start position:0%
up to the Supreme Court again quick
followup

03:44:56.269 --> 03:44:56.279 align:start position:0%
followup
 
03:44:59.790 --> 03:44:59.800 align:start position:0%
followup thank you so would it be
 
03:45:03.429 --> 03:45:03.439 align:start position:0%
appropriate to have the good people who
 
03:45:07.870 --> 03:45:07.880 align:start position:0%
are here to testify and to listen into
 
03:45:11.110 --> 03:45:11.120 align:start position:0%
what's transpiring that
 
03:45:15.590 --> 03:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
they do in fact have parental rights
 
03:45:18.349 --> 03:45:18.359 align:start position:0%
would it be important to acknowledge
 
03:45:20.870 --> 03:45:20.880 align:start position:0%
that to the many who think that they
 
03:45:22.990 --> 03:45:23.000 align:start position:0%
don't have rights and that this
 
03:45:24.429 --> 03:45:24.439 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment is going to
 
03:45:26.630 --> 03:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
give them something which they already
 
03:45:28.070 --> 03:45:28.080 align:start position:0%
have I think that would be appropriate
 
03:45:30.189 --> 03:45:30.199 align:start position:0%
to let the public know that yes you do
 
03:45:32.630 --> 03:45:32.640 align:start position:0%
have parental rights and all we're
 
03:45:34.510 --> 03:45:34.520 align:start position:0%
trying to do here is simply just
 
03:45:37.149 --> 03:45:37.159 align:start position:0%
reaffirm it in our state constitution
 
03:45:39.189 --> 03:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
but guess what folks you already have
 
03:45:39.199 --> 03:45:40.229 align:start position:0%
but guess what folks you already have
parental

03:45:40.229 --> 03:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
parental
 
03:45:43.110 --> 03:45:43.120 align:start position:0%
rights um I I don't see any problem with
 
03:45:46.269 --> 03:45:46.279 align:start position:0%
that and um uh if you look at the end of
 
03:45:48.790 --> 03:45:48.800 align:start position:0%
the bill there is a guide that would go
 
03:45:52.790 --> 03:45:52.800 align:start position:0%
on the um on the ballot and I I think I
 
03:45:57.229 --> 03:45:57.239 align:start position:0%
tried to make that clear um in that um
 
03:46:03.950 --> 03:46:03.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:07.269 --> 03:46:07.279 align:start position:0%
ballot do you think
 
03:46:10.950 --> 03:46:10.960 align:start position:0%
that bringing various things that we
 
03:46:15.349 --> 03:46:15.359 align:start position:0%
already have together in a one three
 
03:46:18.229 --> 03:46:18.239 align:start position:0%
sentence concise statement would be
 
03:46:20.790 --> 03:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
helpful my background to that is I've
 
03:46:25.070 --> 03:46:25.080 align:start position:0%
been in hearings where the proposed Bill
 
03:46:27.590 --> 03:46:27.600 align:start position:0%
really didn't add anything but it
 
03:46:30.950 --> 03:46:30.960 align:start position:0%
brought it into neat Focus would your
 
03:46:34.389 --> 03:46:34.399 align:start position:0%
bill be doing that um I would I would
 
03:46:37.309 --> 03:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
hope it would be doing that um I think
 
03:46:39.790 --> 03:46:39.800 align:start position:0%
it is important uh I'm from the
 
03:46:43.830 --> 03:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
education committee and we have a um a
 
03:46:46.590 --> 03:46:46.600 align:start position:0%
law book like this of RSA statutes that
 
03:46:47.590 --> 03:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
relate to
 
03:46:51.030 --> 03:46:51.040 align:start position:0%
education and we I cannot tell you how
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
many times we miss things when we write
 
03:46:57.950 --> 03:46:57.960 align:start position:0%
new legislation because um things are in
 
03:47:02.110 --> 03:47:02.120 align:start position:0%
different rsas throughout the Myriad of
 
03:47:05.229 --> 03:47:05.239 align:start position:0%
uh education law um and we have to go
 
03:47:08.030 --> 03:47:08.040 align:start position:0%
back and um correct things that we've
 
03:47:10.990 --> 03:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
missed um
 
03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
did that once or twice this year myself
 
03:47:16.309 --> 03:47:16.319 align:start position:0%
for things I had missed last year so um
 
03:47:18.110 --> 03:47:18.120 align:start position:0%
hopefully this will
 
03:47:23.750 --> 03:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
focus um attention in article two of our
 
03:47:26.630 --> 03:47:26.640 align:start position:0%
constitution um and cover three
 
03:47:29.670 --> 03:47:29.680 align:start position:0%
important points I think that relate to
 
03:47:32.030 --> 03:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
parents and their
 
03:47:34.750 --> 03:47:34.760 align:start position:0%
children other questions yes
 
03:47:37.429 --> 03:47:37.439 align:start position:0%
representative Raymond thank you Mr
 
03:47:39.590 --> 03:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
chairman I have um two questions by my
 
03:47:42.349 --> 03:47:42.359 align:start position:0%
right you may thank you uh and thank you
 
03:47:44.870 --> 03:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
so much for being here um so all my
 
03:47:48.269 --> 03:47:48.279 align:start position:0%
questions are regarding um language in
 
03:47:50.510 --> 03:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
the bill so the first question I have is
 
03:47:54.070 --> 03:47:54.080 align:start position:0%
regarding uh line three um your bill
 
03:47:56.670 --> 03:47:56.680 align:start position:0%
says to direct the upbringing Education
 
03:47:59.110 --> 03:47:59.120 align:start position:0%
and Care um and the prior bill that
 
03:48:01.830 --> 03:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
we're kind of hearing together says to
 
03:48:04.750 --> 03:48:04.760 align:start position:0%
control and I wanted uh to
 
03:48:07.670 --> 03:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
know in your opinion what is
 
03:48:11.070 --> 03:48:11.080 align:start position:0%
the the difference legally between those
 
03:48:11.080 --> 03:48:12.030 align:start position:0%
the the difference legally between those
two

03:48:12.030 --> 03:48:12.040 align:start position:0%
two
 
03:48:16.950 --> 03:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
terms um I I think that possibly uh
 
03:48:19.229 --> 03:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
control um might
 
03:48:23.950 --> 03:48:23.960 align:start position:0%
have um other implications rather than
 
03:48:27.670 --> 03:48:27.680 align:start position:0%
directing um control
 
03:48:27.680 --> 03:48:29.710 align:start position:0%
directing um control
could

03:48:29.710 --> 03:48:29.720 align:start position:0%
could
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
um I I don't want to criticize um
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
another bill but I think control um
 
03:48:39.070 --> 03:48:39.080 align:start position:0%
could have uh ramifications in terms of
 
03:48:39.080 --> 03:48:40.189 align:start position:0%
could have uh ramifications in terms of
um

03:48:40.189 --> 03:48:40.199 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:48:41.510 --> 03:48:41.520 align:start position:0%
uh if the
 
03:48:45.670 --> 03:48:45.680 align:start position:0%
child um has concerns they a minor child
 
03:48:49.030 --> 03:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
but 14 years old and has concerns about
 
03:48:51.630 --> 03:48:51.640 align:start position:0%
their upbringing and the
 
03:48:54.710 --> 03:48:54.720 align:start position:0%
control of the the parents in their
 
03:48:57.950 --> 03:48:57.960 align:start position:0%
upbringing is this bestowing rights on
 
03:49:01.429 --> 03:49:01.439 align:start position:0%
the child in relation to the upbringing
 
03:49:04.710 --> 03:49:04.720 align:start position:0%
of the parent okay thank you and my
 
03:49:08.389 --> 03:49:08.399 align:start position:0%
second one is on um line number seven
 
03:49:10.269 --> 03:49:10.279 align:start position:0%
and eight it says it shall not be
 
03:49:12.309 --> 03:49:12.319 align:start position:0%
construed to apply to parental action or
 
03:49:13.790 --> 03:49:13.800 align:start position:0%
decision that would end life or
 
03:49:16.229 --> 03:49:16.239 align:start position:0%
otherwise physically harm a child um and
 
03:49:19.149 --> 03:49:19.159 align:start position:0%
I personally appreciate you throwing
 
03:49:21.670 --> 03:49:21.680 align:start position:0%
that in there um but under our child
 
03:49:24.790 --> 03:49:24.800 align:start position:0%
abuse statute um being physically
 
03:49:27.269 --> 03:49:27.279 align:start position:0%
injured is one part of our child abuse
 
03:49:29.630 --> 03:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
statute but being psychologically
 
03:49:32.590 --> 03:49:32.600 align:start position:0%
injured or or trafficked is the other
 
03:49:34.710 --> 03:49:34.720 align:start position:0%
half of our child abuse statute and so
 
03:49:38.710 --> 03:49:38.720 align:start position:0%
I'm curious as to whether or not um that
 
03:49:41.630 --> 03:49:41.640 align:start position:0%
part if if if this Constitutional
 
03:49:43.590 --> 03:49:43.600 align:start position:0%
Amendment were to be adopted would it
 
03:49:46.469 --> 03:49:46.479 align:start position:0%
override our current prohibition on
 
03:49:49.269 --> 03:49:49.279 align:start position:0%
psychological abuse or trafficking of
 
03:49:52.830 --> 03:49:52.840 align:start position:0%
your own child I I I would not read it
 
03:49:54.950 --> 03:49:54.960 align:start position:0%
that way no because neither of those
 
03:49:58.510 --> 03:49:58.520 align:start position:0%
causes physical harm or death right but
 
03:50:01.189 --> 03:50:01.199 align:start position:0%
um uh there are other things that could
 
03:50:04.149 --> 03:50:04.159 align:start position:0%
happen to a child that I think would um
 
03:50:07.349 --> 03:50:07.359 align:start position:0%
you would look to our statutes um in
 
03:50:09.630 --> 03:50:09.640 align:start position:0%
terms of I I wouldn't see putting in a
 
03:50:11.870 --> 03:50:11.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment anything about
 
03:50:14.229 --> 03:50:14.239 align:start position:0%
um trafficking your own child but
 
03:50:16.710 --> 03:50:16.720 align:start position:0%
certainly um law enforcement agencies
 
03:50:18.189 --> 03:50:18.199 align:start position:0%
would look to our
 
03:50:22.349 --> 03:50:22.359 align:start position:0%
statutes uh to see um to see that as as
 
03:50:26.189 --> 03:50:26.199 align:start position:0%
a penalty or or a criminal act um but I
 
03:50:28.070 --> 03:50:28.080 align:start position:0%
wouldn't see that anything like that
 
03:50:30.630 --> 03:50:30.640 align:start position:0%
being put into our constitution would
 
03:50:33.389 --> 03:50:33.399 align:start position:0%
you I I think that I'm sorry would you
 
03:50:35.950 --> 03:50:35.960 align:start position:0%
agree representative that the line one
 
03:50:38.510 --> 03:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
the word inserting means you're adding
 
03:50:41.309 --> 03:50:41.319 align:start position:0%
something it is not a replacement
 
03:50:43.870 --> 03:50:43.880 align:start position:0%
language which could put what the
 
03:50:46.189 --> 03:50:46.199 align:start position:0%
representative fears into Jeopardy this
 
03:50:50.189 --> 03:50:50.199 align:start position:0%
is merely inserting additional language
 
03:50:52.590 --> 03:50:52.600 align:start position:0%
therefore the existing language stands
 
03:50:55.590 --> 03:50:55.600 align:start position:0%
would you agree uh I would agree the I
 
03:50:57.710 --> 03:50:57.720 align:start position:0%
think all current statutes um would
 
03:51:00.990 --> 03:51:01.000 align:start position:0%
stand um in relation to um parents and
 
03:51:04.990 --> 03:51:05.000 align:start position:0%
their children thank you representative
 
03:51:07.950 --> 03:51:07.960 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:51:12.790 --> 03:51:12.800 align:start position:0%
you for coming my pleasure and U are the
 
03:51:14.750 --> 03:51:14.760 align:start position:0%
are the Bills
 
03:51:19.149 --> 03:51:19.159 align:start position:0%
structured so that it would need to be a
 
03:51:22.550 --> 03:51:22.560 align:start position:0%
crime in order for the state to step in
 
03:51:24.070 --> 03:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
to a
 
03:51:26.790 --> 03:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
family um so in other words someone be
 
03:51:28.469 --> 03:51:28.479 align:start position:0%
needs to be prosecuted and convicted
 
03:51:31.030 --> 03:51:31.040 align:start position:0%
before they can disturb the family you
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
know that's wrong word uh intercede
 
03:51:38.790 --> 03:51:38.800 align:start position:0%
maybe like a like um Department of Child
 
03:51:42.189 --> 03:51:42.199 align:start position:0%
and Youth services or uh
 
03:51:42.199 --> 03:51:47.990 align:start position:0%
and Youth services or uh
DCF

03:51:47.990 --> 03:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:48.000 --> 03:51:49.950 align:start position:0%
 
uh

03:51:49.950 --> 03:51:49.960 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:51:52.830 --> 03:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
based I'm sorry I think the language
 
03:51:54.510 --> 03:51:54.520 align:start position:0%
based on Supreme Court
 
03:51:57.710 --> 03:51:57.720 align:start position:0%
decisions uh is intended just to um
 
03:52:01.189 --> 03:52:01.199 align:start position:0%
indicate that the state needs to have a
 
03:52:03.830 --> 03:52:03.840 align:start position:0%
com as the as is stated a compelling
 
03:52:06.590 --> 03:52:06.600 align:start position:0%
interest and it has to be of the highest
 
03:52:11.309 --> 03:52:11.319 align:start position:0%
order in order to step in um uh I heard
 
03:52:13.910 --> 03:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
when I came in previous testimony about
 
03:52:17.070 --> 03:52:17.080 align:start position:0%
uhu you know vaccines or you know drugs
 
03:52:21.510 --> 03:52:21.520 align:start position:0%
and so forth um I think for the state or
 
03:52:24.030 --> 03:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
any subdivision political subdivision to
 
03:52:27.149 --> 03:52:27.159 align:start position:0%
get involved um it has to be of
 
03:52:30.070 --> 03:52:30.080 align:start position:0%
Paramount interest of the government uh
 
03:52:33.269 --> 03:52:33.279 align:start position:0%
to protect the child to
 
03:52:38.030 --> 03:52:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:40.790 --> 03:52:40.800 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
03:52:42.910 --> 03:52:42.920 align:start position:0%
sidel thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:52:45.550 --> 03:52:45.560 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um my question
 
03:52:47.710 --> 03:52:47.720 align:start position:0%
comes from representative petrigno
 
03:52:49.910 --> 03:52:49.920 align:start position:0%
actually forgive me if I once
 
03:52:53.149 --> 03:52:53.159 align:start position:0%
misunderstood um we have other bills
 
03:52:54.830 --> 03:52:54.840 align:start position:0%
that are coming up before us down the
 
03:52:57.870 --> 03:52:57.880 align:start position:0%
line that have to do with enshrining or
 
03:53:00.229 --> 03:53:00.239 align:start position:0%
codifying Bill laws that we already have
 
03:53:03.750 --> 03:53:03.760 align:start position:0%
in place is that what the aim of this
 
03:53:06.830 --> 03:53:06.840 align:start position:0%
bill is is to enshrine or codify what we
 
03:53:09.429 --> 03:53:09.439 align:start position:0%
already have in place in regular stat
 
03:53:09.439 --> 03:53:12.269 align:start position:0%
already have in place in regular stat
statute

03:53:12.269 --> 03:53:12.279 align:start position:0%
statute
 
03:53:19.710 --> 03:53:19.720 align:start position:0%
um uh to a degree um uh we've tried to
 
03:53:25.110 --> 03:53:25.120 align:start position:0%
um add uh to our rsas about parental
 
03:53:27.870 --> 03:53:27.880 align:start position:0%
rights to put things all in one place um
 
03:53:31.110 --> 03:53:31.120 align:start position:0%
without success um I think maybe a
 
03:53:34.630 --> 03:53:34.640 align:start position:0%
better alternative um is the
 
03:53:38.389 --> 03:53:38.399 align:start position:0%
Constitution um with a simple um few
 
03:53:38.399 --> 03:53:39.670 align:start position:0%
Constitution um with a simple um few
sentences

03:53:39.670 --> 03:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
sentences
 
03:53:43.309 --> 03:53:43.319 align:start position:0%
to uh explain parental rights with at a
 
03:53:47.070 --> 03:53:47.080 align:start position:0%
at a high level with the all current
 
03:53:50.670 --> 03:53:50.680 align:start position:0%

03:54:30.070 --> 03:54:30.080 align:start position:0%
around for a little bit please uh I have
 
03:54:31.349 --> 03:54:31.359 align:start position:0%
no other pink
 
03:54:34.950 --> 03:54:34.960 align:start position:0%
cards and what I have
 
03:54:39.429 --> 03:54:39.439 align:start position:0%
suggested is unusual but not improper
 
03:54:40.950 --> 03:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
and that is to ask both of you to come
 
03:54:42.830 --> 03:54:42.840 align:start position:0%
up to the table the sponsors of both of
 
03:54:45.389 --> 03:54:45.399 align:start position:0%
the bills and have almost like a
 
03:54:47.990 --> 03:54:48.000 align:start position:0%
Roundtable it's not quite an executive
 
03:54:51.309 --> 03:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
session it's whatever we're doing and
 
03:54:54.630 --> 03:54:54.640 align:start position:0%
find a name for it because you know your
 
03:54:56.510 --> 03:54:56.520 align:start position:0%
gracious comments representative at the
 
03:55:01.870 --> 03:55:01.880 align:start position:0%
beginning um say to me that both of you
 
03:55:04.910 --> 03:55:04.920 align:start position:0%
are really trying to achieve much the
 
03:55:07.189 --> 03:55:07.199 align:start position:0%
same thing there may be a few
 
03:55:09.710 --> 03:55:09.720 align:start position:0%
differences maybe some of of them are
 
03:55:12.269 --> 03:55:12.279 align:start position:0%
linguistic but if we can get both of you
 
03:55:14.590 --> 03:55:14.600 align:start position:0%
here at once talking to each other as
 
03:55:17.309 --> 03:55:17.319 align:start position:0%
well as to us we may do my favorite
 
03:55:19.710 --> 03:55:19.720 align:start position:0%
thing in the house which is square a
 
03:55:22.229 --> 03:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
circle so with that representative hold
 
03:55:24.469 --> 03:55:24.479 align:start position:0%
you bat lead off
 
03:55:27.269 --> 03:55:27.279 align:start position:0%
sure so by no means am I an expert on
 
03:55:28.990 --> 03:55:29.000 align:start position:0%
our constitution but I do read the
 
03:55:31.790 --> 03:55:31.800 align:start position:0%
document fairly often at least weekly
 
03:55:35.149 --> 03:55:35.159 align:start position:0%
relative to producing a pink sheet um I
 
03:55:36.990 --> 03:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
want to point out words matter and I
 
03:55:38.229 --> 03:55:38.239 align:start position:0%
want to bring up the New Hampshire
 
03:55:40.830 --> 03:55:40.840 align:start position:0%
Constitution in Article 2 to talk about
 
03:55:44.269 --> 03:55:44.279 align:start position:0%
that so which is not I'm going to use
 
03:55:45.670 --> 03:55:45.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to explain why I'm bringing
 
03:55:48.149 --> 03:55:48.159 align:start position:0%
that up which is the first article in
 
03:55:51.389 --> 03:55:51.399 align:start position:0%
this section of 2 A2B right is natural
 
03:55:52.950 --> 03:55:52.960 align:start position:0%
rights all men have certain natural
 
03:55:54.750 --> 03:55:54.760 align:start position:0%
essential and inherent rights among
 
03:55:56.349 --> 03:55:56.359 align:start position:0%
which are the enjoying and defending of
 
03:55:59.269 --> 03:55:59.279 align:start position:0%
life and Liberty arguing possession and
 
03:56:00.910 --> 03:56:00.920 align:start position:0%
protecting property and in a word
 
03:56:04.030 --> 03:56:04.040 align:start position:0%
seeking and obtaining happiness that was
 
03:56:06.349 --> 03:56:06.359 align:start position:0%
what was passed when they adopted the
 
03:56:08.750 --> 03:56:08.760 align:start position:0%
constitution in 74 they added the
 
03:56:11.070 --> 03:56:11.080 align:start position:0%
following sentence equality of rights
 
03:56:12.870 --> 03:56:12.880 align:start position:0%
under the law shall not be denied or
 
03:56:14.790 --> 03:56:14.800 align:start position:0%
Abridged by this state on the account of
 
03:56:17.830 --> 03:56:17.840 align:start position:0%
race Creed color sex or national origin
 
03:56:19.110 --> 03:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
that sounds
 
03:56:21.950 --> 03:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
great the technical issue with adding
 
03:56:25.269 --> 03:56:25.279 align:start position:0%
that sentence the way it was constructed
 
03:56:26.469 --> 03:56:26.479 align:start position:0%
is it does
 
03:56:26.479 --> 03:56:28.830 align:start position:0%
is it does
allow

03:56:28.830 --> 03:56:28.840 align:start position:0%
allow
 
03:56:33.790 --> 03:56:33.800 align:start position:0%
um to um to have a bias because of age
 
03:56:36.590 --> 03:56:36.600 align:start position:0%
age didn't make this magic list it would
 
03:56:38.030 --> 03:56:38.040 align:start position:0%
have been better if that Amendment just
 
03:56:39.750 --> 03:56:39.760 align:start position:0%
said equality the rights under this law
 
03:56:41.590 --> 03:56:41.600 align:start position:0%
shall not be denied or Abridged by this
 
03:56:44.309 --> 03:56:44.319 align:start position:0%
state period but by adding a magic list
 
03:56:45.790 --> 03:56:45.800 align:start position:0%
of things that are
 
03:56:48.229 --> 03:56:48.239 align:start position:0%
contained what they did was said this is
 
03:56:49.830 --> 03:56:49.840 align:start position:0%
the magic categories where you can
 
03:56:51.229 --> 03:56:51.239 align:start position:0%
abridge rights but anything else is
 
03:56:53.710 --> 03:56:53.720 align:start position:0%
still in play when we write
 
03:56:55.750 --> 03:56:55.760 align:start position:0%
Constitutional Amendments we really want
 
03:56:59.309 --> 03:56:59.319 align:start position:0%
broad language and not very specifics
 
03:57:00.830 --> 03:57:00.840 align:start position:0%
we're not writing statutes different
 
03:57:04.229 --> 03:57:04.239 align:start position:0%
it's a completely different construction
 
03:57:06.389 --> 03:57:06.399 align:start position:0%
method I don't think anybody would want
 
03:57:09.990 --> 03:57:10.000 align:start position:0%
to say our state authorizes right bias
 
03:57:13.070 --> 03:57:13.080 align:start position:0%
based on age that would be
 
03:57:15.510 --> 03:57:15.520 align:start position:0%
bad but that's what the Constitution
 
03:57:17.790 --> 03:57:17.800 align:start position:0%
would allow the way it is constructed
 
03:57:20.550 --> 03:57:20.560 align:start position:0%
legally in this I think the broader
 
03:57:23.349 --> 03:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
language of the proposed amendment to 25
 
03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
that I can't speak about is probably the
 
03:57:27.269 --> 03:57:27.279 align:start position:0%
broadest one I do like some of the
 
03:57:28.550 --> 03:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
sections of
 
03:57:31.070 --> 03:57:31.080 align:start position:0%
17 um I think this is natural rights
 
03:57:32.790 --> 03:57:32.800 align:start position:0%
versus fundamental that's the section of
 
03:57:34.110 --> 03:57:34.120 align:start position:0%
the statute we're putting in it could be
 
03:57:35.750 --> 03:57:35.760 align:start position:0%
natural fundamental it could be both
 
03:57:37.870 --> 03:57:37.880 align:start position:0%
right there are good Court reasons why
 
03:57:39.149 --> 03:57:39.159 align:start position:0%
youd use fun
 
03:57:41.389 --> 03:57:41.399 align:start position:0%
fundamental relative to the Supreme
 
03:57:44.070 --> 03:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
Court but New Hampshire right we call
 
03:57:45.510 --> 03:57:45.520 align:start position:0%
them natural rights if we're going to
 
03:57:47.309 --> 03:57:47.319 align:start position:0%
keep within our constitutional framework
 
03:57:49.189 --> 03:57:49.199 align:start position:0%
I would use the word natural I don't
 
03:57:50.790 --> 03:57:50.800 align:start position:0%
think it makes a big difference someone
 
03:57:51.990 --> 03:57:52.000 align:start position:0%
pointed out the difference between
 
03:57:54.910 --> 03:57:54.920 align:start position:0%
direct and control um that I would look
 
03:57:56.750 --> 03:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
to a legal scholar to find out the
 
03:57:59.149 --> 03:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
actual difference of those um we have a
 
03:58:01.269 --> 03:58:01.279 align:start position:0%
constitutional amendment in this year to
 
03:58:03.309 --> 03:58:03.319 align:start position:0%
change the word cherished to the word
 
03:58:06.990 --> 03:58:07.000 align:start position:0%
cherish yeah um literally that's all the
 
03:58:07.990 --> 03:58:08.000 align:start position:0%
one of the other constitutional
 
03:58:10.309 --> 03:58:10.319 align:start position:0%
amendments does does is update the
 
03:58:12.469 --> 03:58:12.479 align:start position:0%
definition doesn't change the language
 
03:58:14.870 --> 03:58:14.880 align:start position:0%
in the Constitution at all it's because
 
03:58:17.790 --> 03:58:17.800 align:start position:0%
words evolve over time because that word
 
03:58:20.110 --> 03:58:20.120 align:start position:0%
matters I would ask that this committee
 
03:58:21.870 --> 03:58:21.880 align:start position:0%
put a lot of time into the word direct
 
03:58:24.149 --> 03:58:24.159 align:start position:0%
versus control fundamental versus
 
03:58:28.550 --> 03:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
natural um that's my take I I have about
 
03:58:29.830 --> 03:58:29.840 align:start position:0%
10 more minutes I have a bill
 
03:58:32.189 --> 03:58:32.199 align:start position:0%
introduction um in another committee at
 
03:58:33.630 --> 03:58:33.640 align:start position:0%
2 o'clock that's running a little bit
 
03:58:36.149 --> 03:58:36.159 align:start position:0%
late but may I ask you representative um
 
03:58:38.630 --> 03:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
I was going to ask this in a minute but
 
03:58:41.710 --> 03:58:41.720 align:start position:0%
uh would it would it be possible for you
 
03:58:43.309 --> 03:58:43.319 align:start position:0%
and would it be possible for you
 
03:58:46.550 --> 03:58:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli to come up with
 
03:58:46.560 --> 03:58:47.950 align:start position:0%
representative cordelli to come up with
one

03:58:47.950 --> 03:58:47.960 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:58:50.469 --> 03:58:50.479 align:start position:0%
unified absolutely
 
03:58:53.110 --> 03:58:53.120 align:start position:0%
Amendment would you like to try
 
03:58:56.309 --> 03:58:56.319 align:start position:0%
it this is a late bill so we have a
 
03:58:57.630 --> 03:58:57.640 align:start position:0%
little bit of
 
03:59:01.110 --> 03:59:01.120 align:start position:0%
time um take the best of both Stand
 
03:59:05.269 --> 03:59:05.279 align:start position:0%
United it Mr chair yes is it worth
 
03:59:07.030 --> 03:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
having a quick subcommittee that we work
 
03:59:08.710 --> 03:59:08.720 align:start position:0%
with to craft that language or would
 
03:59:10.750 --> 03:59:10.760 align:start position:0%
like us to come
 
03:59:13.189 --> 03:59:13.199 align:start position:0%
together cuz one meeting of a sub
 
03:59:14.830 --> 03:59:14.840 align:start position:0%
there's time right and I don't need
 
03:59:16.550 --> 03:59:16.560 align:start position:0%
another day at the State House nor does
 
03:59:18.189 --> 03:59:18.199 align:start position:0%
anybody else on this committee given the
 
03:59:20.469 --> 03:59:20.479 align:start position:0%
amount of time that we have here um
 
03:59:23.469 --> 03:59:23.479 align:start position:0%
volunteering but maybe a subcommittee to
 
03:59:24.710 --> 03:59:24.720 align:start position:0%
finalize the language so that
 
03:59:26.550 --> 03:59:26.560 align:start position:0%
everybody's happy because we can craft
 
03:59:28.670 --> 03:59:28.680 align:start position:0%
something but ultimately you need the
 
03:59:30.309 --> 03:59:30.319 align:start position:0%
committee members themselves to also
 
03:59:32.070 --> 03:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
weigh in if they have concerns and I'd
 
03:59:33.670 --> 03:59:33.680 align:start position:0%
love to hear their concerns would you be
 
03:59:35.710 --> 03:59:35.720 align:start position:0%
amendable to that representative a
 
03:59:37.870 --> 03:59:37.880 align:start position:0%
subcommittee including the two of us the
 
03:59:41.149 --> 03:59:41.159 align:start position:0%
two of you and three or four of us yes
 
03:59:42.990 --> 03:59:43.000 align:start position:0%
okay who would be interested in doing
 
03:59:46.630 --> 03:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
that anybody who's related by blood or
 
03:59:47.940 --> 03:59:47.950 align:start position:0%
marriage to a judge
 
03:59:47.950 --> 03:59:50.030 align:start position:0%
marriage to a judge
[Laughter]

03:59:50.030 --> 03:59:50.040 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
03:59:53.389 --> 03:59:53.399 align:start position:0%

04:01:12.830 --> 04:01:12.840 align:start position:0%
very uncomfortable going forward with
 
04:01:16.950 --> 04:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
Bill um without some real legal
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
consultation from somebody that's very
 
04:01:21.189 --> 04:01:21.199 align:start position:0%
familiar with constitutional law I would
 
04:01:22.750 --> 04:01:22.760 align:start position:0%
think the subcommittee would bring those
 
04:01:25.429 --> 04:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
people in I know well that's why I put
 
04:01:27.670 --> 04:01:27.680 align:start position:0%
myself on this I I didn't know if Chuck
