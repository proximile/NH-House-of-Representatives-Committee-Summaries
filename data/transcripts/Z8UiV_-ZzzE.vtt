a couple days later about how the bill
 
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.160 align:start position:0%
passed with amendment in
 
00:07:24.589 --> 00:07:24.599 align:start position:0%
committee they said did we pass that
 
00:07:26.029 --> 00:07:26.039 align:start position:0%
through you know I was sitting over
 
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:28.280 align:start position:0%
there and and you know all my wisdom is
 
00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
over here so I didn't know anything
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
about that so I made a few calls and
 
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
said yeah you don't you remember the
 
00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:37.360 align:start position:0%
amendment passed we EXA it whoops so I
 
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:40.680 align:start position:0%

00:08:59.790 --> 00:08:59.800 align:start position:0%
random the chair recognizes Jason Taylor
 
00:09:03.269 --> 00:09:03.279 align:start position:0%
and he lists his address as Lisa massio
 
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:05.360 align:start position:0%
which is actually his next door neighbor
 
00:09:07.670 --> 00:09:07.680 align:start position:0%
right there and they are from the office
 
00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:10.200 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate and they will be

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:22.000 align:start position:0%
1261 good morning chairman paron and the
 
00:09:23.990 --> 00:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
committee I am attorney Lisa masio the
 
00:09:26.069 --> 00:09:26.079 align:start position:0%
associate child advocate with the office
 
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:28.360 align:start position:0%
of child advocate and I have with me one
 
00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:30.560 align:start position:0%
of our assistant child advocates in the
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
Ombudsman role Jason Taylor um we just
 
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:35.560 align:start position:0%
wanted to give you all a little bit of
 
00:09:37.509 --> 00:09:37.519 align:start position:0%
context and background um we weren't
 
00:09:39.550 --> 00:09:39.560 align:start position:0%
involved with the drafting of this bill
 
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:42.040 align:start position:0%
but this is an issue that we see fairly
 
00:09:44.710 --> 00:09:44.720 align:start position:0%
frequently at our office and are hopeful
 
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:46.680 align:start position:0%
that the language in this bill will
 
00:09:49.710 --> 00:09:49.720 align:start position:0%
allow for some additional um services to
 
00:09:52.509 --> 00:09:52.519 align:start position:0%
be provided for children um I'm going to
 
00:09:54.509 --> 00:09:54.519 align:start position:0%
let Jason take the lead on this one
 
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
because he has been in the field for a
 
00:09:57.910 --> 00:09:57.920 align:start position:0%
long time and is actively working on
 
00:10:00.069 --> 00:10:00.079 align:start position:0%
several cases related to this
 
00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:02.360 align:start position:0%
spell good morning Mr chairman thank you
 
00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:04.680 align:start position:0%
so much I'm happy to answer questions as
 
00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.360 align:start position:0%
well um we have taken a look at the
 
00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:11.560 align:start position:0%
language in the bill and um in terms of
 
00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:13.240 align:start position:0%
working with teenagers which has been
 
00:10:15.310 --> 00:10:15.320 align:start position:0%
the majority of my career both uh for
 
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
DCF and at snoooo Center as well as in
 
00:10:20.710 --> 00:10:20.720 align:start position:0%
the mental health field uh a child's
 
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
reluctance to treatment is Paramount in
 
00:10:27.670 --> 00:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
many many cases that we see uh in fact I
 
00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.480 align:start position:0%
I would say many high-profile cases in
 
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.000 align:start position:0%
our state uh have been riddled with
 
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:34.000 align:start position:0%
reluctance on the part of the child to
 
00:10:36.670 --> 00:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
receive Services many many times we see
 
00:10:39.470 --> 00:10:39.480 align:start position:0%
that in in and I think that's I would
 
00:10:40.990 --> 00:10:41.000 align:start position:0%
say that a child a teenage child's
 
00:10:42.949 --> 00:10:42.959 align:start position:0%
behavior is maybe as predictable as the
 
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:44.680 align:start position:0%
weather here in New England that we're
 
00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:47.440 align:start position:0%
seeing these days so um a child's
 
00:10:51.949 --> 00:10:51.959 align:start position:0%
refusal to accept Services is more
 
00:10:53.629 --> 00:10:53.639 align:start position:0%
common than a child that's willing to
 
00:10:55.829 --> 00:10:55.839 align:start position:0%
work with anyone especially in this age
 
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.040 align:start position:0%
range especially a child that is being
 
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:00.040 align:start position:0%
considered for any type typ of uh State
 
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.200 align:start position:0%
service so that was a primary concern um
 
00:11:04.710 --> 00:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
we had mentioned this morning as well
 
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:06.680 align:start position:0%
that we've seen many post- adopt cases
 
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:08.920 align:start position:0%
that have come in very caring families
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
that have adopted children from the
 
00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:13.480 align:start position:0%
system the child uh is not eligible for
 
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:15.360 align:start position:0%
an abuse neglect case because the
 
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
parents are of course trying to get the
 
00:11:19.590 --> 00:11:19.600 align:start position:0%
child help the child is very um
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
reluctant to work with anyone especially
 
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
anyone with DCF attached to them and
 
00:11:27.389 --> 00:11:27.399 align:start position:0%
we're seeing those children um having a
 
00:11:31.150 --> 00:11:31.160 align:start position:0%
hard time entering Services uh including
 
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:33.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes fastforward referrals are made
 
00:11:38.030 --> 00:11:38.040 align:start position:0%
uh from a DCF worker and the family in
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
some cases does not engage with those
 
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:44.200 align:start position:0%
services so just I think Building Things
 
00:11:46.030 --> 00:11:46.040 align:start position:0%
based on a child's willingness to enter
 
00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:47.680 align:start position:0%
mental health treatment or any type of
 
00:11:50.710 --> 00:11:50.720 align:start position:0%
services is a slippery slope and we feel
 
00:11:54.269 --> 00:11:54.279 align:start position:0%
that it will um it will take Services
 
00:11:56.230 --> 00:11:56.240 align:start position:0%
away from children that that otherwise
 
00:11:58.350 --> 00:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
need it uh and lastly I would just say
 
00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:00.480 align:start position:0%
that in many of these cases the parents
 
00:12:03.910 --> 00:12:03.920 align:start position:0%
are very motivated to get the child help
 
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:06.360 align:start position:0%
and we want to you know the parents to
 
00:12:07.829 --> 00:12:07.839 align:start position:0%
be able to make those decisions that
 
00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040 align:start position:0%
their child requires that and not base a
 
00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:11.760 align:start position:0%
child's services on what they're willing
 
00:12:13.670 --> 00:12:13.680 align:start position:0%
to do because many of them are not
 
00:12:17.230 --> 00:12:17.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:20.360 align:start position:0%
services and we just wanted um looking
 
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:22.360 align:start position:0%
at the language of this particular Bill
 
00:12:23.550 --> 00:12:23.560 align:start position:0%
and again we didn't work with the
 
00:12:26.269 --> 00:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
sponsors on this but if you read how the
 
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:29.120 align:start position:0%
language is currently the current way it
 
00:12:31.509 --> 00:12:31.519 align:start position:0%
works is that refusal of the child to
 
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:33.880 align:start position:0%
participate in the development of a
 
00:12:37.590 --> 00:12:37.600 align:start position:0%
voluntary family service plan or um with
 
00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.590 align:start position:0%
voluntary family service plan or um with
the

00:12:38.590 --> 00:12:38.600 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:12:40.790 --> 00:12:40.800 align:start position:0%
Department May constitute sufficient
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
information for them to say we're not
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
going to help the families typically the
 
00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
parents who are asking for voluntary
 
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:47.720 align:start position:0%
chins which is a child in need of
 
00:12:50.990 --> 00:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
services saying we really need help for
 
00:12:53.269 --> 00:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
our child they're having trouble dealing
 
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
with their child probably a stranger
 
00:12:56.189 --> 00:12:56.199 align:start position:0%
coming into the home might initially
 
00:12:58.069 --> 00:12:58.079 align:start position:0%
have trouble as well so this new
 
00:13:01.230 --> 00:13:01.240 align:start position:0%
language really just makes it clear that
 
00:13:04.670 --> 00:13:04.680 align:start position:0%
that initial refusal or reluctance which
 
00:13:06.790 --> 00:13:06.800 align:start position:0%
is normal particularly for a child that
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
has a significant amount of trauma
 
00:13:11.509 --> 00:13:11.519 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be the sole basis for this
 
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
decision going forward of like we're not
 
00:13:15.430 --> 00:13:15.440 align:start position:0%
going to offer
 
00:13:17.629 --> 00:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
services again there could be other
 
00:13:19.550 --> 00:13:19.560 align:start position:0%
reasons why they may not offer services
 
00:13:22.069 --> 00:13:22.079 align:start position:0%
but we have seen cases where it's just
 
00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:23.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a hard no because this kid's
 
00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
hard to work with even if the family is
 
00:13:29.110 --> 00:13:29.120 align:start position:0%
still desperately asking for help we see
 
00:13:31.189 --> 00:13:31.199 align:start position:0%
this in Ed boarding cases as well I know
 
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:32.320 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk in this
 
00:13:34.389 --> 00:13:34.399 align:start position:0%
committee about those cases parents
 
00:13:35.949 --> 00:13:35.959 align:start position:0%
desperately trying to get their children
 
00:13:37.710 --> 00:13:37.720 align:start position:0%
help it is very hard to get into the
 
00:13:40.790 --> 00:13:40.800 align:start position:0%
system and we'd really rather not see a
 
00:13:43.189 --> 00:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
kid have to go through 169b which is
 
00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:45.000 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice wait till they do
 
00:13:46.550 --> 00:13:46.560 align:start position:0%
something that there's charges being
 
00:13:50.430 --> 00:13:50.440 align:start position:0%
filed for the Department to feel able or
 
00:13:53.509 --> 00:13:53.519 align:start position:0%
willing to provide services because as
 
00:13:55.990 --> 00:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
much as we want a kid in whatever door
 
00:13:57.949 --> 00:13:57.959 align:start position:0%
they need to be the Juvenile Justice
 
00:14:00.949 --> 00:14:00.959 align:start position:0%
door should really be The Last Choice so
 
00:14:03.550 --> 00:14:03.560 align:start position:0%
by building this into 169 D which is
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
that children in need of services can be
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
voluntary we think we just offer
 
00:14:11.470 --> 00:14:11.480 align:start position:0%
additional ability for the division to
 
00:14:13.590 --> 00:14:13.600 align:start position:0%
be able to offer services because
 
00:14:15.069 --> 00:14:15.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes it's even the service provider
 
00:14:16.949 --> 00:14:16.959 align:start position:0%
doing the assessment or in there saying
 
00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:20.160 align:start position:0%
oh the kid said no we're done so we are
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
hopeful that this language and obviously
 
00:14:24.629 --> 00:14:24.639 align:start position:0%
if there's you know questions or
 
00:14:26.829 --> 00:14:26.839 align:start position:0%
amendments to be made but we think this
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
door is important to crack open for kids
 
00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:31.360 align:start position:0%
because we've seen what happens when
 
00:14:34.350 --> 00:14:34.360 align:start position:0%
it's not in other words one strike in
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
your route is off the
 
00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:39.040 align:start position:0%
books we hope so that this language
 
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:41.600 align:start position:0%
would accomplished this
 
00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:44.560 align:start position:0%
yes any questions representative
 
00:14:48.030 --> 00:14:48.040 align:start position:0%
long thank you Mr chairman uh so my
 
00:14:51.870 --> 00:14:51.880 align:start position:0%
concern is uh if a child refuses
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
service is reluctant when he's forced
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
into that service is not going
 
00:15:00.310 --> 00:15:00.320 align:start position:0%
to you know is not going to help the
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
child um so is there any consideration
 
00:15:06.310 --> 00:15:06.320 align:start position:0%
for that I'll let Jason talk about what
 
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:09.480 align:start position:0%
trauma and behaviors typically look
 
00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:12.079 align:start position:0%
like well I think that most children
 
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
when they hear counseling or any type of
 
00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
service anything on paper there's
 
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
definitely some reluctance I think it's
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
just incumbent upon the provider to find
 
00:15:22.470 --> 00:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
inroads with that child I think also
 
00:15:24.030 --> 00:15:24.040 align:start position:0%
depending on the level of trauma that
 
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
the child may have experienced uh under
 
00:15:27.949 --> 00:15:27.959 align:start position:0%
no circumstances will they agree to
 
00:15:30.309 --> 00:15:30.319 align:start position:0%
almost anything but if it is in the best
 
00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
interest and it's a prevention measure
 
00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:33.680 align:start position:0%
to keep that child either out of
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
placement out of the hospital or out of
 
00:15:36.040 --> 00:15:36.990 align:start position:0%
placement out of the hospital or out of
unsafe

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
unsafe
 
00:15:39.829 --> 00:15:39.839 align:start position:0%
situations I think it's a fair trade but
 
00:15:42.389 --> 00:15:42.399 align:start position:0%
I do I certainly uh respect your your
 
00:15:44.269 --> 00:15:44.279 align:start position:0%
thoughts uh representative long about
 
00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:46.120 align:start position:0%
you know sort of wanting that to engage
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
the child but I think that a skilled
 
00:15:50.670 --> 00:15:50.680 align:start position:0%
provider uh should be able to do that
 
00:15:52.949 --> 00:15:52.959 align:start position:0%
and convince the child of the value uh
 
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
again with things like out of home
 
00:15:56.990 --> 00:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
placement or delinquency or other
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
stronger consequences that may be sort
 
00:16:01.269 --> 00:16:01.279 align:start position:0%
of on the horizon for these children you
 
00:16:03.670 --> 00:16:03.680 align:start position:0%
have to find a way to get them in um you
 
00:16:05.309 --> 00:16:05.319 align:start position:0%
know I like to believe I can get in any
 
00:16:07.629 --> 00:16:07.639 align:start position:0%
room and have any child talk to me uh
 
00:16:09.189 --> 00:16:09.199 align:start position:0%
that's been my history I don't really
 
00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:10.920 align:start position:0%
know how that happens or why that
 
00:16:13.269 --> 00:16:13.279 align:start position:0%
happens but trying to convince them and
 
00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:15.360 align:start position:0%
and sometimes it's a strategy about you
 
00:16:16.949 --> 00:16:16.959 align:start position:0%
know convincing them to do what they're
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
willing to do it may not be everything
 
00:16:20.949 --> 00:16:20.959 align:start position:0%
that we want but with the importance of
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
prevention and again you know we're
 
00:16:24.069 --> 00:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
we're very big on trying to keep kids
 
00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:26.360 align:start position:0%
out of the system in a more intrusive
 
00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:28.160 align:start position:0%
way I think that that's where you have
 
00:16:29.910 --> 00:16:29.920 align:start position:0%
the tra off here is is trying to
 
00:16:31.949 --> 00:16:31.959 align:start position:0%
convince a child let's get you some help
 
00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:33.839 align:start position:0%
and some Services now before things go
 
00:16:35.749 --> 00:16:35.759 align:start position:0%
down this other road which you will lose
 
00:16:37.790 --> 00:16:37.800 align:start position:0%
a lot of control uh both as a child and
 
00:16:39.590 --> 00:16:39.600 align:start position:0%
a parent once the child goes into the
 
00:16:42.389 --> 00:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
system and just to add
 
00:16:45.470 --> 00:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
the this is really just more trauma
 
00:16:48.870 --> 00:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
informed Language by recognizing that a
 
00:16:50.990 --> 00:16:51.000 align:start position:0%
child is likely to have an initial
 
00:16:53.470 --> 00:16:53.480 align:start position:0%
refusal or reluctance in addition under
 
00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:55.440 align:start position:0%
voluntary chins the whole family
 
00:16:57.509 --> 00:16:57.519 align:start position:0%
potentially is receiving services in
 
00:16:59.350 --> 00:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
their home
 
00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:01.720 align:start position:0%
which is a wraparound so the parents may
 
00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:03.680 align:start position:0%
even just be able to get some benefit
 
00:17:06.150 --> 00:17:06.160 align:start position:0%
from some coaching learning what the
 
00:17:08.750 --> 00:17:08.760 align:start position:0%
resources are so it's more than just
 
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:11.000 align:start position:0%
forcing a kid to do therapy when they're
 
00:17:12.909 --> 00:17:12.919 align:start position:0%
saying no there's a lot of other pieces
 
00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:15.000 align:start position:0%
of services as we build out this
 
00:17:17.829 --> 00:17:17.839 align:start position:0%
children's Behavioral Health System that
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
could help a
 
00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.029 align:start position:0%
could help a
family

00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
family
 
00:17:23.710 --> 00:17:23.720 align:start position:0%
followup uh thank you Mr chairman uh
 
00:17:27.789 --> 00:17:27.799 align:start position:0%
follow up on this um I you know I'm a
 
00:17:31.549 --> 00:17:31.559 align:start position:0%
firm believer in giving youth choices
 
00:17:33.190 --> 00:17:33.200 align:start position:0%
because once they accept the choice
 
00:17:37.909 --> 00:17:37.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.070 --> 00:17:41.080 align:start position:0%
so I mean I'm thinking that there are
 
00:17:43.350 --> 00:17:43.360 align:start position:0%
alternatives if you don't agree you're
 
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:46.760 align:start position:0%
going to be placed wherever or you're G
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
to be going into the judicial system um
 
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:54.880 align:start position:0%
is that is that a high number uh that
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
are faced with those questions you
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
either get placed out of your your home
 
00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
or you go into the court system or you
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.149 --> 00:18:09.159 align:start position:0%
service I
 
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:12.120 align:start position:0%
would I would say absolutely um that
 
00:18:14.549 --> 00:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
comes up quite a bit I think
 
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:16.960 align:start position:0%
that sometimes we get to those steps
 
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
without trying the things before we see
 
00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:21.760 align:start position:0%
many children entering the most you know
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
the most restrictive level of care um
 
00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440 align:start position:0%
having never experienced intensive
 
00:18:28.789 --> 00:18:28.799 align:start position:0%
inhome supports and there are in
 
00:18:31.470 --> 00:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
placement so I think if you have an
 
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:33.400 align:start position:0%
opportunity to talk to a child and talk
 
00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
them through hey like we can start you
 
00:18:36.750 --> 00:18:36.760 align:start position:0%
know down here and give you this support
 
00:18:38.549 --> 00:18:38.559 align:start position:0%
so that we don't end up there we don't
 
00:18:41.149 --> 00:18:41.159 align:start position:0%
always have that luxury as a system um
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
especially with kids you know if they're
 
00:18:44.909 --> 00:18:44.919 align:start position:0%
involved in a serious crime uh folks are
 
00:18:46.990 --> 00:18:47.000 align:start position:0%
not generally looking to keep the child
 
00:18:48.950 --> 00:18:48.960 align:start position:0%
in the home at that point uh the parents
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
may not feel safe depending on the age
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
and situation of the child so I I would
 
00:18:55.310 --> 00:18:55.320 align:start position:0%
love to have that opportunity more than
 
00:18:57.310 --> 00:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
I think we sometimes do sometimes we do
 
00:18:59.390 --> 00:18:59.400 align:start position:0%
skip right to the most you know serious
 
00:19:02.110 --> 00:19:02.120 align:start position:0%
type of situations and we always look at
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
what you know what prevention was there
 
00:19:06.510 --> 00:19:06.520 align:start position:0%
um you know just anecdotally if you look
 
00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
at the kids that are currently uh at snu
 
00:19:11.950 --> 00:19:11.960 align:start position:0%
Center um over my time there which was
 
00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
there for about three years you know
 
00:19:16.669 --> 00:19:16.679 align:start position:0%
probably high 80% of those kids had you
 
00:19:19.149 --> 00:19:19.159 align:start position:0%
know 20 30 Child Protection referrals
 
00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:21.280 align:start position:0%
before they entered Juvenile Justice you
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
know that that were not necessarily
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
long-term involvement you know talking
 
00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:28.960 align:start position:0%
90 days of sort of looking is key abuse
 
00:19:31.390 --> 00:19:31.400 align:start position:0%
neglect issues that can prevent stronger
 
00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:33.720 align:start position:0%
intervention uh and those were closed
 
00:19:35.390 --> 00:19:35.400 align:start position:0%
and then you know you see these things
 
00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:37.960 align:start position:0%
kind of when you don't find the right
 
00:19:39.710 --> 00:19:39.720 align:start position:0%
services at the right time for a child
 
00:19:42.270 --> 00:19:42.280 align:start position:0%
before they get older we we don't always
 
00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:45.640 align:start position:0%
have the ability to to go that route so
 
00:19:47.190 --> 00:19:47.200 align:start position:0%
it it's a difficult thing to sort of
 
00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
nail down but ultimately prevention um
 
00:19:51.470 --> 00:19:51.480 align:start position:0%
and getting to to Children sooner with
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
the services and support uh will
 
00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:54.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully prevent those things from
 
00:19:57.630 --> 00:19:57.640 align:start position:0%
going down that road just one more one
 
00:20:01.789 --> 00:20:01.799 align:start position:0%
more thank you uh so uh so I look at the
 
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:04.280 align:start position:0%
initial refusal so in this case if this
 
00:20:08.549 --> 00:20:08.559 align:start position:0%
were to pass I refuse as a child I go to
 
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:10.600 align:start position:0%
my first court date and it's like yeah I
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
don't like this um can I accept the
 
00:20:17.830 --> 00:20:17.840 align:start position:0%
voluntary services or is it too late or
 
00:20:20.750 --> 00:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
or I'm placed out of placement I don't
 
00:20:22.430 --> 00:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
like where I
 
00:20:26.430 --> 00:20:26.440 align:start position:0%
am um could I say well wait a minute I
 
00:20:29.549 --> 00:20:29.559 align:start position:0%
want to go I I accept the services
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
because this is initial I think the idea
 
00:20:34.149 --> 00:20:34.159 align:start position:0%
of the language in this bill and again I
 
00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:37.240 align:start position:0%
haven't spoken to the sponsor
 
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:40.960 align:start position:0%
is at that initial refusal if the family
 
00:20:43.310 --> 00:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
is still saying we want a voluntary
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
chins which is a a voluntary pre- Court
 
00:20:48.870 --> 00:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
situation that the service providers
 
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:51.080 align:start position:0%
will still stay in there complete the
 
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
assessment offer what they can that that
 
00:20:55.990 --> 00:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
initial I don't want this is not the end
 
00:20:58.789 --> 00:20:58.799 align:start position:0%
and routes then directly into JJ J or
 
00:21:01.870 --> 00:21:01.880 align:start position:0%
placement it's really just to and again
 
00:21:03.350 --> 00:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
it's the sole decision there may be
 
00:21:04.710 --> 00:21:04.720 align:start position:0%
other things going on that they're like
 
00:21:06.310 --> 00:21:06.320 align:start position:0%
sorry we the voluntary chins isn't going
 
00:21:08.990 --> 00:21:09.000 align:start position:0%
to work but we do feel like this extra
 
00:21:11.669 --> 00:21:11.679 align:start position:0%
sentence opens that door to not just
 
00:21:13.909 --> 00:21:13.919 align:start position:0%
take that initial refusal and say okay
 
00:21:16.669 --> 00:21:16.679 align:start position:0%
you're going to 169b court over there
 
00:21:18.190 --> 00:21:18.200 align:start position:0%
and maybe allow a little bit of
 
00:21:19.669 --> 00:21:19.679 align:start position:0%
breathing room like Jason said if you
 
00:21:20.990 --> 00:21:21.000 align:start position:0%
get a provider in there that's willing
 
00:21:22.669 --> 00:21:22.679 align:start position:0%
to develop a relationship with that
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
child with that family through the
 
00:21:26.510 --> 00:21:26.520 align:start position:0%
course of the assessments get some
 
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:28.120 align:start position:0%
services in place it may not be
 
00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:30.360 align:start position:0%
everything we avoid that whole process
 
00:21:32.630 --> 00:21:32.640 align:start position:0%
Al together okay thank you I'm going to
 
00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:35.120 align:start position:0%
take representative Greg out of order
 
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:37.760 align:start position:0%
here thank you Mr chairman I appreciate
 
00:21:39.669 --> 00:21:39.679 align:start position:0%
that and thank you for taking my
 
00:21:41.990 --> 00:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
question so just to kind of simplify it
 
00:21:44.149 --> 00:21:44.159 align:start position:0%
and knowing that if we understand that
 
00:21:46.510 --> 00:21:46.520 align:start position:0%
traumatized children uh struggle with
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
trust and that certainly on those first
 
00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:50.720 align:start position:0%
you know touches we're going to you're
 
00:21:52.269 --> 00:21:52.279 align:start position:0%
you're just trying to build trust and
 
00:21:55.110 --> 00:21:55.120 align:start position:0%
stuff would the language in this allow
 
00:21:57.510 --> 00:21:57.520 align:start position:0%
you cuz I'm I'm looking at how this you
 
00:21:59.230 --> 00:21:59.240 align:start position:0%
know came about before and how they were
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
doing it before and and knowing that
 
00:22:03.149 --> 00:22:03.159 align:start position:0%
these kids are going to struggle to
 
00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:05.120 align:start position:0%
trust would this just open that door for
 
00:22:06.990 --> 00:22:07.000 align:start position:0%
you to build trust a little more to kind
 
00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:09.640 align:start position:0%
of not make them do these things but
 
00:22:12.310 --> 00:22:12.320 align:start position:0%
just to be able to um have them
 
00:22:13.990 --> 00:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
understand more that this is you you
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
want what's good for them and not you
 
00:22:17.269 --> 00:22:17.279 align:start position:0%
know more of a punishment is that what
 
00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:19.760 align:start position:0%
language like this would do that is our
 
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:22.000 align:start position:0%
hope and our read of this language that
 
00:22:24.870 --> 00:22:24.880 align:start position:0%
that is what they are trying to do yes
 
00:22:26.549 --> 00:22:26.559 align:start position:0%
okay again some of it has to do with how
 
00:22:28.909 --> 00:22:28.919 align:start position:0%
the division ultimately implements the
 
00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:31.240 align:start position:0%
language but I think that is the problem
 
00:22:33.149 --> 00:22:33.159 align:start position:0%
this language is trying to get to and I
 
00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:35.720 align:start position:0%
think it's worded in a way that that is
 
00:22:38.230 --> 00:22:38.240 align:start position:0%
what that means to me okay thank you
 
00:22:40.310 --> 00:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
00:22:44.149 --> 00:22:44.159 align:start position:0%
chairman um so my my question is a
 
00:22:46.430 --> 00:22:46.440 align:start position:0%
little bit similar to uh representative
 
00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:48.720 align:start position:0%
Greg's where I'm I'm wondering if you
 
00:22:51.669 --> 00:22:51.679 align:start position:0%
have experience um my background is as a
 
00:22:53.909 --> 00:22:53.919 align:start position:0%
nurse and sometimes with like dementia
 
00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:55.840 align:start position:0%
patients they they refuse a lot of
 
00:22:57.950 --> 00:22:57.960 align:start position:0%
things but you you bu trust like like
 
00:22:59.310 --> 00:22:59.320 align:start position:0%
like representative Greg was saying and
 
00:23:01.470 --> 00:23:01.480 align:start position:0%
then they ultimately accept so I'm
 
00:23:04.390 --> 00:23:04.400 align:start position:0%
wondering if you have any type of
 
00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:08.960 align:start position:0%
experience in any capacity of kids who
 
00:23:11.110 --> 00:23:11.120 align:start position:0%
have initially refused but then
 
00:23:13.350 --> 00:23:13.360 align:start position:0%
ultimately accepted but maybe you
 
00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:16.080 align:start position:0%
haven't because this bill is not in
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
effect yet so I'm G to let Jason give
 
00:23:19.909 --> 00:23:19.919 align:start position:0%
you an actual example but I will say
 
00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
just generally speaking there's a lot of
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
our laws that recognize that the parents
 
00:23:26.870 --> 00:23:26.880 align:start position:0%
actually are supposed to be in charge so
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
the fact that this get get interpreted
 
00:23:32.110 --> 00:23:32.120 align:start position:0%
that a child's initial reluctance means
 
00:23:34.029 --> 00:23:34.039 align:start position:0%
the family asking for help under a
 
00:23:38.110 --> 00:23:38.120 align:start position:0%
voluntary chins gets a hard pass is a
 
00:23:40.350 --> 00:23:40.360 align:start position:0%
dilemma again that hopefully this
 
00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:42.000 align:start position:0%
language is hoping to address of like
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
but the parents are still asking for
 
00:23:45.789 --> 00:23:45.799 align:start position:0%
help they need help I will let Jason
 
00:23:47.269 --> 00:23:47.279 align:start position:0%
answer your specific question because I
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:53.149 --> 00:23:53.159 align:start position:0%
examples so um thank you for your
 
00:23:55.390 --> 00:23:55.400 align:start position:0%
question I would just say that quite
 
00:23:57.909 --> 00:23:57.919 align:start position:0%
honestly the child has some discretion
 
00:24:00.590 --> 00:24:00.600 align:start position:0%
until they don't until the intervention
 
00:24:02.630 --> 00:24:02.640 align:start position:0%
is put down through court orders and we
 
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:05.240 align:start position:0%
see them go into you know a system in a
 
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
in a in a way that they don't have any
 
00:24:09.549 --> 00:24:09.559 align:start position:0%
choice so in order to to do what you're
 
00:24:11.470 --> 00:24:11.480 align:start position:0%
implying which is sort of getting them
 
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:14.600 align:start position:0%
to to buy in you have to sort of have
 
00:24:17.029 --> 00:24:17.039 align:start position:0%
that conversation about about it and it
 
00:24:19.789 --> 00:24:19.799 align:start position:0%
it is a nuanced thing and I and I agree
 
00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:21.440 align:start position:0%
with what Lisa had said in terms of the
 
00:24:22.830 --> 00:24:22.840 align:start position:0%
parents I think sometimes as a
 
00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
professional you have to work with the
 
00:24:25.909 --> 00:24:25.919 align:start position:0%
parents they know their child best
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
they're asking for help some of them are
 
00:24:30.149 --> 00:24:30.159 align:start position:0%
begging help and they've they feel that
 
00:24:32.269 --> 00:24:32.279 align:start position:0%
they've tried everything they can use in
 
00:24:34.510 --> 00:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
their toolbox so once they're connected
 
00:24:36.830 --> 00:24:36.840 align:start position:0%
with providers they can also show their
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
child they're working on things and be a
 
00:24:40.870 --> 00:24:40.880 align:start position:0%
participant in the case as well and I
 
00:24:42.830 --> 00:24:42.840 align:start position:0%
would also just mention that you know if
 
00:24:44.510 --> 00:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
if a child goes through the wrong door
 
00:24:47.950 --> 00:24:47.960 align:start position:0%
and enters into the system DCF has every
 
00:24:50.389 --> 00:24:50.399 align:start position:0%
opportunity to close cases and to to
 
00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:52.120 align:start position:0%
send the family to other service
 
00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:54.200 align:start position:0%
providers if they feel it does not meet
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
their need so you know I don't know that
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
the danger of this is you know doing too
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
little for a child it's it's almost like
 
00:25:04.470 --> 00:25:04.480 align:start position:0%
a child could be sort of evaluated to
 
00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:06.520 align:start position:0%
need more and then once the family
 
00:25:08.070 --> 00:25:08.080 align:start position:0%
starts doing some work you see
 
00:25:10.149 --> 00:25:10.159 align:start position:0%
improvements and the child can leave you
 
00:25:12.389 --> 00:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
know so I think that the value far
 
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:14.840 align:start position:0%
outweighs the danger of of it going down
 
00:25:17.070 --> 00:25:17.080 align:start position:0%
the wrong path but yes children are very
 
00:25:20.029 --> 00:25:20.039 align:start position:0%
resistant to counseling and services um
 
00:25:22.389 --> 00:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
you know I typically believe in sort of
 
00:25:24.669 --> 00:25:24.679 align:start position:0%
building children up with sports and
 
00:25:26.269 --> 00:25:26.279 align:start position:0%
activities and doing all those other
 
00:25:28.389 --> 00:25:28.399 align:start position:0%
things too so I think that if there's
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
other things you can offer in addition
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
to you know a counselor intervention
 
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:35.120 align:start position:0%
that the child doesn't want uh sometimes
 
00:25:37.269 --> 00:25:37.279 align:start position:0%
that can help as well but and I don't
 
00:25:38.669 --> 00:25:38.679 align:start position:0%
believe in threatening children but they
 
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:40.520 align:start position:0%
do need to understand that their choices
 
00:25:42.269 --> 00:25:42.279 align:start position:0%
will go away when they enter the system
 
00:25:44.870 --> 00:25:44.880 align:start position:0%
in a in a more intrusive way and the
 
00:25:47.990 --> 00:25:48.000 align:start position:0%
family um typically does not want that
 
00:25:49.789 --> 00:25:49.799 align:start position:0%
and we usually advise them against that
 
00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
if at all possible so this is a way to
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
um to try to prevent them from getting
 
00:25:57.029 --> 00:25:57.039 align:start position:0%
caught up in the system and missing
 
00:25:58.590 --> 00:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
school and doing you know the things
 
00:26:01.310 --> 00:26:01.320 align:start position:0%
that we see the pitfalls of all of that
 
00:26:03.389 --> 00:26:03.399 align:start position:0%
representative D
 
00:26:06.310 --> 00:26:06.320 align:start position:0%
Simone thank you Mr chairman uh my
 
00:26:09.230 --> 00:26:09.240 align:start position:0%
question is in line with the the last
 
00:26:13.710 --> 00:26:13.720 align:start position:0%
two if you please uh is it your opinion
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
through your experience
 
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:20.000 align:start position:0%
that the analogy of leading the
 
00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:23.080 align:start position:0%
proverbial horse to the water uh they'll
 
00:26:25.470 --> 00:26:25.480 align:start position:0%
get parched enough where eventually
 
00:26:28.110 --> 00:26:28.120 align:start position:0%
they'll start to drink they'll start to
 
00:26:31.029 --> 00:26:31.039 align:start position:0%
trust they'll start to recognize and
 
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
will this uh the language in this bill
 
00:26:38.149 --> 00:26:38.159 align:start position:0%
help to bridge that
 
00:26:42.149 --> 00:26:42.159 align:start position:0%
Gap we we believe so that the way it is
 
00:26:45.310 --> 00:26:45.320 align:start position:0%
written and the intent behind it is to
 
00:26:48.149 --> 00:26:48.159 align:start position:0%
do that to not just take the initial no
 
00:26:50.389 --> 00:26:50.399 align:start position:0%
and walk away but to keep
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
dry thank
 
00:26:55.830 --> 00:26:55.840 align:start position:0%
you representative ball thank you
 
00:26:57.789 --> 00:26:57.799 align:start position:0%
chairman peon and thank you for for all
 
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:01.000 align:start position:0%
your hard work and um and for taking my
 
00:27:03.549 --> 00:27:03.559 align:start position:0%
question when I was a teacher I was um
 
00:27:05.310 --> 00:27:05.320 align:start position:0%
certified as an emotional behavioral
 
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:07.840 align:start position:0%
specialists and I did have children that
 
00:27:11.190 --> 00:27:11.200 align:start position:0%
um were on chins and also some that were
 
00:27:13.549 --> 00:27:13.559 align:start position:0%
just court involved um that required me
 
00:27:15.269 --> 00:27:15.279 align:start position:0%
to go to the courts is that still the
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
system do you still work with wraparound
 
00:27:22.269 --> 00:27:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:24.600 align:start position:0%
districts absolutely I think when the
 
00:27:26.789 --> 00:27:26.799 align:start position:0%
state becomes involved with the child um
 
00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:28.880 align:start position:0%
the goal should be to pull in everybody
 
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960 align:start position:0%
that has information about the child uh
 
00:27:32.470 --> 00:27:32.480 align:start position:0%
increased communication and work
 
00:27:35.230 --> 00:27:35.240 align:start position:0%
together um that's that's essentially
 
00:27:38.269 --> 00:27:38.279 align:start position:0%
you know I think that um one of the
 
00:27:40.310 --> 00:27:40.320 align:start position:0%
biggest things that that I see with with
 
00:27:42.549 --> 00:27:42.559 align:start position:0%
kids coming into the system is is again
 
00:27:44.269 --> 00:27:44.279 align:start position:0%
making sure that everyone's on the same
 
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:46.240 align:start position:0%
page and working together to prevent
 
00:27:48.909 --> 00:27:48.919 align:start position:0%
things from going down a dangerous path
 
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:51.440 align:start position:0%
um I I would also just say that you know
 
00:27:53.789 --> 00:27:53.799 align:start position:0%
in terms of like children's resistance I
 
00:27:56.350 --> 00:27:56.360 align:start position:0%
mean that's also a way um to bring
 
00:27:57.669 --> 00:27:57.679 align:start position:0%
people in if they do have people people
 
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:00.240 align:start position:0%
they trust at school um you know
 
00:28:01.710 --> 00:28:01.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes I'll ask to go meet with a
 
00:28:04.789 --> 00:28:04.799 align:start position:0%
child uh in my previous career um with a
 
00:28:06.149 --> 00:28:06.159 align:start position:0%
school professional or guidance
 
00:28:07.710 --> 00:28:07.720 align:start position:0%
counselor to sort of soften that
 
00:28:10.590 --> 00:28:10.600 align:start position:0%
introduction when I was a DCF worker um
 
00:28:13.830 --> 00:28:13.840 align:start position:0%
I think that relationships go a long way
 
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:16.320 align:start position:0%
and so you have to just be I
 
00:28:18.509 --> 00:28:18.519 align:start position:0%
think sometimes you have to convince a
 
00:28:20.830 --> 00:28:20.840 align:start position:0%
child to do something uh for a variety
 
00:28:22.430 --> 00:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
of reasons and and use a different
 
00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
methods But ultimately with this people
 
00:28:26.310 --> 00:28:26.320 align:start position:0%
that they trust absolutely you'd want to
 
00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960 align:start position:0%
collaborate with those folks and get the
 
00:28:29.430 --> 00:28:29.440 align:start position:0%
information in terms of what they
 
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:31.480 align:start position:0%
believe the child's need is uh School
 
00:28:33.110 --> 00:28:33.120 align:start position:0%
professionals as we saw during covid
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
have a ton of information regarding how
 
00:28:38.549 --> 00:28:38.559 align:start position:0%
a child functions at school um and so so
 
00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440 align:start position:0%
we would absolutely always want to get
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
that information in order to do our jobs
 
00:28:44.549 --> 00:28:44.559 align:start position:0%
better and that is one of the advantages
 
00:28:46.909 --> 00:28:46.919 align:start position:0%
of our office the office of child
 
00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:48.480 align:start position:0%
advocate being a sort of independent
 
00:28:51.190 --> 00:28:51.200 align:start position:0%
oversight agency is we get calls from
 
00:28:53.389 --> 00:28:53.399 align:start position:0%
all different angles from within the
 
00:28:56.029 --> 00:28:56.039 align:start position:0%
system from within the school and
 
00:28:58.310 --> 00:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
sometimes our role is just bringing all
 
00:29:00.389 --> 00:29:00.399 align:start position:0%
those players together to the same table
 
00:29:02.909 --> 00:29:02.919 align:start position:0%
so we do have sort of a a broader view
 
00:29:05.710 --> 00:29:05.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes of these cases than just the
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
worker from the division might have or
 
00:29:10.350 --> 00:29:10.360 align:start position:0%
just the teacher might have so um that
 
00:29:11.710 --> 00:29:11.720 align:start position:0%
is sort of one of the advantages of the
 
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:14.080 align:start position:0%
work we're able to do thank you very
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
much I do appreciate all you do and it
 
00:29:18.190 --> 00:29:18.200 align:start position:0%
does take a village to raise um our
 
00:29:20.909 --> 00:29:20.919 align:start position:0%
children and um again thank you so much
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:26.549 --> 00:29:26.559 align:start position:0%
service no further hands seeing no
 
00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:28.600 align:start position:0%
further hands thank thank you very much
 
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:36.720 align:start position:0%

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:05.600 align:start position:0%
I apologize I'm still getting used to
 
00:30:07.509 --> 00:30:07.519 align:start position:0%
this good morning everybody I again
 
00:30:10.549 --> 00:30:10.559 align:start position:0%
Susan larab be general counsel for DCF I
 
00:30:12.789 --> 00:30:12.799 align:start position:0%
am here to answer any questions and to
 
00:30:15.509 --> 00:30:15.519 align:start position:0%
maybe also go through the chins process
 
00:30:17.669 --> 00:30:17.679 align:start position:0%
with everybody and the in the Statue
 
00:30:20.110 --> 00:30:20.120 align:start position:0%
itself I think there was some um maybe
 
00:30:21.990 --> 00:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding that this is about
 
00:30:26.310 --> 00:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
chins pursuant to 169 d a child in need
 
00:30:27.830 --> 00:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
of services
 
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:30.880 align:start position:0%
um and if you look at the Statue as a
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
whole many of what has been discussed
 
00:30:35.789 --> 00:30:35.799 align:start position:0%
already is already embedded into the
 
00:30:38.430 --> 00:30:38.440 align:start position:0%
statute for the various reasons we we
 
00:30:40.669 --> 00:30:40.679 align:start position:0%
know and we've talked about children
 
00:30:42.630 --> 00:30:42.640 align:start position:0%
change their minds all the time
 
00:30:44.950 --> 00:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
especially adolesence and that is built
 
00:30:46.430 --> 00:30:46.440 align:start position:0%
into the
 
00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:51.320 align:start position:0%
statute where it says I apologize in uh
 
00:30:56.070 --> 00:30:56.080 align:start position:0%
169 DB a voluntary service plan at any
 
00:30:58.590 --> 00:30:58.600 align:start position:0%
time before after a petition is filed
 
00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:01.320 align:start position:0%
the child his or her caretaker and the
 
00:31:04.350 --> 00:31:04.360 align:start position:0%
department may effectuate an individual
 
00:31:06.230 --> 00:31:06.240 align:start position:0%
voluntary family service plan which
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
shall include and goes over the elements
 
00:31:10.669 --> 00:31:10.679 align:start position:0%
of what to include in a voluntary
 
00:31:12.830 --> 00:31:12.840 align:start position:0%
service plan which would result in the
 
00:31:14.789 --> 00:31:14.799 align:start position:0%
case being as it says in the in the
 
00:31:17.549 --> 00:31:17.559 align:start position:0%
statute um stayed for a period of 90
 
00:31:20.149 --> 00:31:20.159 align:start position:0%
days because we know again the first
 
00:31:23.590 --> 00:31:23.600 align:start position:0%
time that this comes into DCF for an
 
00:31:26.230 --> 00:31:26.240 align:start position:0%
assessment and the uh if it meets the
 
00:31:30.190 --> 00:31:30.200 align:start position:0%
definition of again not a 169b case
 
00:31:33.990 --> 00:31:34.000 align:start position:0%
which is delinquency which is again if a
 
00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:37.320 align:start position:0%
child engages in what would be a felony
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
or misdemeanor in the adult world that
 
00:31:43.269 --> 00:31:43.279 align:start position:0%
is delinquency this is a Chin's petition
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
a child in need of services who is
 
00:31:48.389 --> 00:31:48.399 align:start position:0%
either a habitual runaway habitually
 
00:31:52.310 --> 00:31:52.320 align:start position:0%
truant repeatedly engaging in violations
 
00:31:55.549 --> 00:31:55.559 align:start position:0%
or what's called a 2d case a child based
 
00:31:58.669 --> 00:31:58.679 align:start position:0%
on their I should should read this uh by
 
00:32:00.430 --> 00:32:00.440 align:start position:0%
quoting it because it is a very a
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
detailed part of the statue with the
 
00:32:05.629 --> 00:32:05.639 align:start position:0%
diagnosis diagnosis of severe emotional
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
cognitive or other mental health issues
 
00:32:10.509 --> 00:32:10.519 align:start position:0%
who engage in aggressive fire setting or
 
00:32:12.830 --> 00:32:12.840 align:start position:0%
sexualized behavior that pose a danger
 
00:32:14.629 --> 00:32:14.639 align:start position:0%
to the child or others and who is
 
00:32:17.830 --> 00:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise unable or ineligible for
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
services under 169 B or C and those are
 
00:32:24.029 --> 00:32:24.039 align:start position:0%
the definitions of the chin statue when
 
00:32:27.549 --> 00:32:27.559 align:start position:0%
that comes into dcyf for an assessment
 
00:32:29.830 --> 00:32:29.840 align:start position:0%
that juvenile probation parole officer
 
00:32:33.310 --> 00:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
as a case worker engages the family to
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
try to do a voluntary Service uh plan in
 
00:32:41.230 --> 00:32:41.240 align:start position:0%
lie of instead of bringing the court the
 
00:32:44.430 --> 00:32:44.440 align:start position:0%
case to court through a Chin's petition
 
00:32:47.190 --> 00:32:47.200 align:start position:0%
and a Chin's petition can be brought by
 
00:32:49.430 --> 00:32:49.440 align:start position:0%
a parent it can be brought by law
 
00:32:51.549 --> 00:32:51.559 align:start position:0%
enforcement it can be bought brought by
 
00:32:53.509 --> 00:32:53.519 align:start position:0%
a truant
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
officer to avoid that of course we want
 
00:32:59.350 --> 00:32:59.360 align:start position:0%
the child and the parent to be engaging
 
00:33:02.230 --> 00:33:02.240 align:start position:0%
with DCF to engage in a voluntary
 
00:33:04.509 --> 00:33:04.519 align:start position:0%
service plan and by definition the word
 
00:33:06.549 --> 00:33:06.559 align:start position:0%
voluntary means that it's something that
 
00:33:09.509 --> 00:33:09.519 align:start position:0%
both the parent and the child want if
 
00:33:12.750 --> 00:33:12.760 align:start position:0%
that is not the case and the child says
 
00:33:14.789 --> 00:33:14.799 align:start position:0%
I don't want to engage in a voluntary
 
00:33:18.590 --> 00:33:18.600 align:start position:0%
service plan then the option is for the
 
00:33:20.629 --> 00:33:20.639 align:start position:0%
person who originally called that case
 
00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:24.000 align:start position:0%
in to then petition the court for an
 
00:33:27.029 --> 00:33:27.039 align:start position:0%
actual Chin's case and within the chin
 
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
Chin's petition itself the Chin's
 
00:33:32.310 --> 00:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
petition must State how voluntary
 
00:33:36.389 --> 00:33:36.399 align:start position:0%
Services have been attempted and why
 
00:33:37.990 --> 00:33:38.000 align:start position:0%
there is not a
 
00:33:41.549 --> 00:33:41.559 align:start position:0%
voluntary uh service case plan
 
00:33:44.509 --> 00:33:44.519 align:start position:0%
executed when it gets set then for court
 
00:33:47.389 --> 00:33:47.399 align:start position:0%
based on that petition if the kid comes
 
00:33:50.230 --> 00:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
in and that time the kid also gets
 
00:33:53.509 --> 00:33:53.519 align:start position:0%
assigned counil to also represent the
 
00:33:56.789 --> 00:33:56.799 align:start position:0%
child's best interest so if the parent
 
00:33:58.789 --> 00:33:58.799 align:start position:0%
and and the child are not seeing eye to
 
00:34:01.950 --> 00:34:01.960 align:start position:0%
eye there's also now an outside counsel
 
00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:02.710 align:start position:0%
eye there's also now an outside counsel
who

00:34:02.710 --> 00:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
who
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
can uh explain more about the voluntary
 
00:34:09.109 --> 00:34:09.119 align:start position:0%
service plan as well to a child or an
 
00:34:11.470 --> 00:34:11.480 align:start position:0%
adolescent who may be reluctant to
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
engage and like I said it's already part
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
of the statute that if that happens we
 
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:22.280 align:start position:0%
can all agree in terms of DCF the court
 
00:34:24.710 --> 00:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
the parents the family the defense

attorney I'm sorry the juveniles
attorney

00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:28.679 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
00:34:30.869 --> 00:34:30.879 align:start position:0%
that this case should be placed on file
 
00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:32.480 align:start position:0%
it should be stayed remove from the
 
00:34:35.069 --> 00:34:35.079 align:start position:0%
court calendar because now we have a kid
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
who wants to engage in the process so
 
00:34:41.030 --> 00:34:41.040 align:start position:0%
bottom line the the wording of the bill
 
00:34:43.990 --> 00:34:44.000 align:start position:0%
is already embedded into other sections
 
00:34:47.950 --> 00:34:47.960 align:start position:0%
of the 169 D chins
 
00:34:51.629 --> 00:34:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:54.669 --> 00:34:54.679 align:start position:0%
you am I the only one that thinks we're
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
really overthinking this it is very
 
00:35:01.470 --> 00:35:01.480 align:start position:0%
simple to me but then again um that
 
00:35:02.910 --> 00:35:02.920 align:start position:0%
we're just saying one strike you're not
 
00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:04.640 align:start position:0%
out anymore you can come back again
 
00:35:07.349 --> 00:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
that's it period which is written with
 
00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
very specific um instructions to the
 
00:35:13.710 --> 00:35:13.720 align:start position:0%
court when that happens place the uh the
 
00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:15.560 align:start position:0%
voluntary service plan shall stay the
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
proceedings for a period not to exceed
 
00:35:19.910 --> 00:35:19.920 align:start position:0%
90 days from the date of implementation
 
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:21.800 align:start position:0%
unless the parties agree in writing for
 
00:35:25.310 --> 00:35:25.320 align:start position:0%
an extension um and then ultimately the
 
00:35:27.349 --> 00:35:27.359 align:start position:0%
voluntary family service plan will
 
00:35:30.190 --> 00:35:30.200 align:start position:0%
suspend the proceedings if the child
 
00:35:32.230 --> 00:35:32.240 align:start position:0%
satisfies the terms of the voluntary
 
00:35:35.069 --> 00:35:35.079 align:start position:0%
family service plan he or she shall be
 
00:35:37.150 --> 00:35:37.160 align:start position:0%
discharged from further services or
 
00:35:39.990 --> 00:35:40.000 align:start position:0%
supervision and the pending complaint or
 
00:35:43.069 --> 00:35:43.079 align:start position:0%
petition shall be dismissed with
 
00:35:46.270 --> 00:35:46.280 align:start position:0%
prejudice again because we all want the
 
00:35:48.470 --> 00:35:48.480 align:start position:0%
same exactly not without prejudice with
 
00:35:50.950 --> 00:35:50.960 align:start position:0%
prejudice because we all want the same
 
00:35:54.030 --> 00:35:54.040 align:start position:0%
thing we all want the child to receive
 
00:35:56.230 --> 00:35:56.240 align:start position:0%
services and we want the child to be
 
00:35:59.069 --> 00:35:59.079 align:start position:0%
volunt terly brought into the process
 
00:35:59.079 --> 00:36:00.910 align:start position:0%
volunt terly brought into the process

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:17.560 align:start position:0%
don't have that data I mean is it a lot
 
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:20.400 align:start position:0%

00:36:37.069 --> 00:36:37.079 align:start position:0%
this right um under
 
00:36:41.910 --> 00:36:41.920 align:start position:0%
69d there is 90 days so if I'm sent to
 
00:36:46.510 --> 00:36:46.520 align:start position:0%
JJ in a month goes by and I decide as a
 
00:36:49.109 --> 00:36:49.119 align:start position:0%
youth that I'll take these voluntary
 
00:36:51.790 --> 00:36:51.800 align:start position:0%
Services there's a stay in the court and
 
00:36:54.990 --> 00:36:55.000 align:start position:0%
there's there's 90 days that that could
 
00:36:58.030 --> 00:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
happen there's 90 days that we have
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
agreed by agreement to the court to take
 
00:37:03.309 --> 00:37:03.319 align:start position:0%
it off the court calendar for 90 days
 
00:37:06.030 --> 00:37:06.040 align:start position:0%
and within that time if the juvenile
 
00:37:07.630 --> 00:37:07.640 align:start position:0%
then once again says you know I don't
 
00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:10.400 align:start position:0%
want to participate in this voluntary
 
00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
process or they go to a a a a child
 
00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:17.960 align:start position:0%
adolescent needs assessment um interview
 
00:37:20.349 --> 00:37:20.359 align:start position:0%
to find out what kind of plan that is
 
00:37:23.349 --> 00:37:23.359 align:start position:0%
right for this child if something goes
 
00:37:25.950 --> 00:37:25.960 align:start position:0%
south so to speak then yes it can be
 
00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:27.960 align:start position:0%
brought back onto the calendar within
 
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:29.960 align:start position:0%
that 90 days if it's not it
 
00:37:31.829 --> 00:37:31.839 align:start position:0%
automatically will get dismissed at the
 
00:37:34.430 --> 00:37:34.440 align:start position:0%
end of those 90 days pursuant to the
 
00:37:38.069 --> 00:37:38.079 align:start position:0%
last part of that statute okay if the if
 
00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:39.680 align:start position:0%
the child satisfied the terms of the
 
00:37:41.589 --> 00:37:41.599 align:start position:0%
voluntary service plan he will be
 
00:37:45.109 --> 00:37:45.119 align:start position:0%
discharged from further uh services and
 
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:48.920 align:start position:0%
the complaint will be dismissed followup
 
00:37:50.710 --> 00:37:50.720 align:start position:0%
representative long yeah I'm trying to
 
00:37:52.829 --> 00:37:52.839 align:start position:0%
figure out this initial
 
00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:55.720 align:start position:0%
refusal passing this bill what effect it
 
00:37:59.589 --> 00:37:59.599 align:start position:0%
would have negative l i in your opinion
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
does initial
 
00:38:04.589 --> 00:38:04.599 align:start position:0%
refusal take get rid of that 90day thing
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
because now we're talking initial no I
 
00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:09.560 align:start position:0%
think what it does is that it gets rid
 
00:38:10.710 --> 00:38:10.720 align:start position:0%
of that
 
00:38:14.670 --> 00:38:14.680 align:start position:0%
initial need to f i the way I read it
 
00:38:18.030 --> 00:38:18.040 align:start position:0%
and again I I'm not sure again uh we're
 
00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:21.000 align:start position:0%
overthinking it init the word initial is
 
00:38:22.990 --> 00:38:23.000 align:start position:0%
what I'm because initial that happens
 
00:38:25.470 --> 00:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
all the time and that's why it's been
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
already put into this other subsection
 
00:38:29.750 --> 00:38:29.760 align:start position:0%
saying if a kiddo changes their mind
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
fine that's great um so I don't know if
 
00:38:36.589 --> 00:38:36.599 align:start position:0%
that means if there's an initial refusal
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
but the parent and the juvenile
 
00:38:41.550 --> 00:38:41.560 align:start position:0%
probation officer still believes that
 
00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:44.440 align:start position:0%
voluntary services in their is in their
 
00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
child in the child's best interest that
 
00:38:51.349 --> 00:38:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
becomes imposed on them imposed on the
 
00:38:57.990 --> 00:38:58.000 align:start position:0%
child there but again therefore how is
 
00:39:01.230 --> 00:39:01.240 align:start position:0%
that voluntary the term voluntary has to
 
00:39:04.230 --> 00:39:04.240 align:start position:0%
be voluntary for the parent the child
 
00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:06.400 align:start position:0%
and the juvenile probation officer and
 
00:39:10.430 --> 00:39:10.440 align:start position:0%
it says and inscribing it representative
 
00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:12.960 align:start position:0%
Greg thank you Mr chairman and thank you
 
00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:14.520 align:start position:0%
for being here and explaining and taking
 
00:39:17.829 --> 00:39:17.839 align:start position:0%
my question so back to um I'm sure you
 
00:39:19.829 --> 00:39:19.839 align:start position:0%
heard me ask that question so you know
 
00:39:21.390 --> 00:39:21.400 align:start position:0%
we start started by saying that we
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
understand that these kids you know
 
00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:24.400 align:start position:0%
probably have a lack of trust and that
 
00:39:26.790 --> 00:39:26.800 align:start position:0%
we're trying to build trust what we
 
00:39:29.750 --> 00:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
currently have in statute says that if
 
00:39:29.760 --> 00:39:32.030 align:start position:0%
currently have in statute says that if
they

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:32.040 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:39:35.150 --> 00:39:35.160 align:start position:0%
um if they refuse then we do go into the
 
00:39:38.349 --> 00:39:38.359 align:start position:0%
courts in this 90day thing however with
 
00:39:40.230 --> 00:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
this particular Amendment we're saying
 
00:39:41.910 --> 00:39:41.920 align:start position:0%
you know what we understand that they're
 
00:39:44.150 --> 00:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
probably going to say no so let us build
 
00:39:47.829 --> 00:39:47.839 align:start position:0%
trust with them and do that and I do you
 
00:39:50.069 --> 00:39:50.079 align:start position:0%
not feel that that's that's not forcing
 
00:39:51.990 --> 00:39:52.000 align:start position:0%
them that's building taking a moment to
 
00:39:53.589 --> 00:39:53.599 align:start position:0%
build that trust rather than threatening
 
00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
them and saying we're going straight to
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
court now and we have a 90day a leeway
 
00:39:59.470 --> 00:39:59.480 align:start position:0%
but we're basically threatening is that
 
00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:01.560 align:start position:0%
what is that what you're saying I
 
00:40:05.109 --> 00:40:05.119 align:start position:0%
absolutely agree and that's why I did um
 
00:40:07.510 --> 00:40:07.520 align:start position:0%
in my the way my brain works I wrote
 
00:40:10.270 --> 00:40:10.280 align:start position:0%
down language I thought might be clear
 
00:40:13.150 --> 00:40:13.160 align:start position:0%
to me as a reader of the bill and I just
 
00:40:16.150 --> 00:40:16.160 align:start position:0%
said that the child initial reluctance
 
00:40:18.550 --> 00:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
Andor refusal to participate in a
 
00:40:21.270 --> 00:40:21.280 align:start position:0%
voluntary Services assessment should not
 
00:40:24.309 --> 00:40:24.319 align:start position:0%
be the sole reason to not engage and
 
00:40:27.750 --> 00:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
assess if voluntary service is otherwise
 
00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:29.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate and in the best interest of
 
00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
the child because I think the way it
 
00:40:35.430 --> 00:40:35.440 align:start position:0%
reads is that the assessment worker may
 
00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:37.800 align:start position:0%
go to the house start talking to the
 
00:40:41.109 --> 00:40:41.119 align:start position:0%
child and the child says no I'm not
 
00:40:43.910 --> 00:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
interested and that without that
 
00:40:46.109 --> 00:40:46.119 align:start position:0%
language proposed that means the
 
00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:48.240 align:start position:0%
assessment worker could leave and then
 
00:40:50.470 --> 00:40:50.480 align:start position:0%
recommend that a Chin's petition be
 
00:40:53.270 --> 00:40:53.280 align:start position:0%
filed so this is saying that if a child
 
00:40:56.510 --> 00:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
initially says no further Engage The
 
00:40:59.589 --> 00:40:59.599 align:start position:0%
child work with the child before making
 
00:41:01.990 --> 00:41:02.000 align:start position:0%
that final determination uh that a
 
00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:04.960 align:start position:0%
Chin's petition can be filed because
 
00:41:07.270 --> 00:41:07.280 align:start position:0%
again it's not the JJ assessment worker
 
00:41:09.430 --> 00:41:09.440 align:start position:0%
who's bringing the petition it's either
 
00:41:12.069 --> 00:41:12.079 align:start position:0%
law enforcement the treny officer the
 
00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:14.480 align:start position:0%
school or the parent they're just giving
 
00:41:16.030 --> 00:41:16.040 align:start position:0%
the acknowledgement pursuant to the way
 
00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:18.000 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:41:21.270 --> 00:41:21.280 align:start position:0%
reads um any petition filed shall
 
00:41:23.950 --> 00:41:23.960 align:start position:0%
include language demonstrating whether
 
00:41:27.309 --> 00:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate voluntary services have been
 
00:41:29.750 --> 00:41:29.760 align:start position:0%
attempted the nature of voluntary
 
00:41:32.470 --> 00:41:32.480 align:start position:0%
service attempted and the reason Court
 
00:41:34.790 --> 00:41:34.800 align:start position:0%
compulsion is necessary so that's
 
00:41:36.750 --> 00:41:36.760 align:start position:0%
already part of the statue and it's
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
already embedded into the the petition
 
00:41:42.790 --> 00:41:42.800 align:start position:0%
for a chins um as as it is already
 
00:41:45.230 --> 00:41:45.240 align:start position:0%
representative Greg followup I'm just
 
00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
wondering then are you for this bill or
 
00:41:50.270 --> 00:41:50.280 align:start position:0%
are you not for this bill because the
 
00:41:51.870 --> 00:41:51.880 align:start position:0%
explanation you just gave sounded like
 
00:41:54.309 --> 00:41:54.319 align:start position:0%
you you see the necessity of explaining
 
00:41:56.670 --> 00:41:56.680 align:start position:0%
it this way in this bill so I maybe I'm
 
00:41:58.430 --> 00:41:58.440 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm not for the way the bill
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
read the four corners of the bill the
 
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
exact language of that
 
00:42:06.109 --> 00:42:06.119 align:start position:0%
wording we are not for because I think
 
00:42:08.710 --> 00:42:08.720 align:start position:0%
it leads to a lot of uh interpretation
 
00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
that a child can be
 
00:42:17.510 --> 00:42:17.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:19.829 --> 00:42:19.839 align:start position:0%
plan is it true to say you like the
 
00:42:22.790 --> 00:42:22.800 align:start position:0%
general idea the concept but the wording
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
would as we know sometimes if it's uous
 
00:42:28.710 --> 00:42:28.720 align:start position:0%
any reasonable person can come up with
 
00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
several different conclusions and the
 
00:42:33.390 --> 00:42:33.400 align:start position:0%
concept is already in practice and it's
 
00:42:36.069 --> 00:42:36.079 align:start position:0%
in policy and it's already again written
 
00:42:39.870 --> 00:42:39.880 align:start position:0%
that a JJ assessment worker goes and
 
00:42:42.829 --> 00:42:42.839 align:start position:0%
engages with the family as part of the
 
00:42:42.839 --> 00:42:48.430 align:start position:0%
engages with the family as part of the
assessment

00:42:48.430 --> 00:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:58.549 --> 00:42:58.559 align:start position:0%
Panic so you're saying this bill is not
 
00:43:01.630 --> 00:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
necessary because it's duplicating what
 
00:43:04.109 --> 00:43:04.119 align:start position:0%
we already have absolutely and it's
 
00:43:06.510 --> 00:43:06.520 align:start position:0%
already in language of various
 
00:43:09.630 --> 00:43:09.640 align:start position:0%
subsections of the Chin's petition for
 
00:43:11.630 --> 00:43:11.640 align:start position:0%
that very reason that kids change their
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
mind it's in various sections because it
 
00:43:16.069 --> 00:43:16.079 align:start position:0%
happens at different times it could even
 
00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:18.760 align:start position:0%
happen post what we called adjudication
 
00:43:20.990 --> 00:43:21.000 align:start position:0%
where right before a disposition hey can
 
00:43:22.950 --> 00:43:22.960 align:start position:0%
we come to consent can there be an
 
00:43:25.190 --> 00:43:25.200 align:start position:0%
agreement so there's many different
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
steps of the legal process and that's
 
00:43:28.990 --> 00:43:29.000 align:start position:0%
why it's written in so many different
 
00:43:31.910 --> 00:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
subsections of the chin and it is in the
 
00:43:34.430 --> 00:43:34.440 align:start position:0%
Chin's petition I mean in the chin
 
00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:36.880 align:start position:0%
statute that a child may change their
 
00:43:40.190 --> 00:43:40.200 align:start position:0%
mind at any time thank
 
00:43:42.829 --> 00:43:42.839 align:start position:0%
you seeing nothing further I do want to
 
00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:44.760 align:start position:0%
call uh
 
00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:48.720 align:start position:0%
what oh sorry representative
 
00:43:50.950 --> 00:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
brickford thank you Mr chairman and
 
00:43:54.309 --> 00:43:54.319 align:start position:0%
thank you for coming
 
00:43:57.630 --> 00:43:57.640 align:start position:0%
um it's it's in the it's in the Chin's
 
00:44:00.710 --> 00:44:00.720 align:start position:0%
statutes the stin statutes were had a
 
00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:01.630 align:start position:0%
statutes the stin statutes were had a
major

00:44:01.630 --> 00:44:01.640 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:44:05.549 --> 00:44:05.559 align:start position:0%
overhaul some years ago uh on
 
00:44:08.710 --> 00:44:08.720 align:start position:0%
them and I thought they had it
 
00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.270 align:start position:0%
them and I thought they had it
right

00:44:11.270 --> 00:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:44:14.549 --> 00:44:14.559 align:start position:0%
and is it possible that you're just not
 
00:44:16.470 --> 00:44:16.480 align:start position:0%
it's not happening in practice even
 
00:44:17.630 --> 00:44:17.640 align:start position:0%
though it's in statute it's not
 
00:44:19.069 --> 00:44:19.079 align:start position:0%
happening in
 
00:44:21.030 --> 00:44:21.040 align:start position:0%
practice and no matter what you right
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
here may not work if if the Department's
 
00:44:27.230 --> 00:44:27.240 align:start position:0%
not doing it doing what's written here
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
to do and I I know you fairly knew but
 
00:44:32.069 --> 00:44:32.079 align:start position:0%
you might want to check that out as to
 
00:44:34.950 --> 00:44:34.960 align:start position:0%
why they're the bill came
 
00:44:37.470 --> 00:44:37.480 align:start position:0%
forward thank you sure thank you
 
00:44:40.150 --> 00:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
representative deimon thank you Mr
 
00:44:41.750 --> 00:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
question and all you
 
00:44:45.670 --> 00:44:45.680 align:start position:0%
do is it your
 
00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
opinion that the language in this bill
 
00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.230 align:start position:0%
opinion that the language in this bill
will

00:44:50.230 --> 00:44:50.240 align:start position:0%
will
 
00:44:54.349 --> 00:44:54.359 align:start position:0%
not in any way enhance the current
 
00:44:57.670 --> 00:44:57.680 align:start position:0%
Chin's language
 
00:45:01.309 --> 00:45:01.319 align:start position:0%
exactly and it would actually be less um
 
00:45:05.589 --> 00:45:05.599 align:start position:0%
focused on the needs the rights the
 
00:45:08.510 --> 00:45:08.520 align:start position:0%
independence of the child by having a
 
00:45:13.589 --> 00:45:13.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:16.000 align:start position:0%
Services thank you for your testimony
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
I've been watching OCA over there and uh
 
00:45:22.109 --> 00:45:22.119 align:start position:0%
I would like to invite you back thank
 
00:45:24.069 --> 00:45:24.079 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony I would like to
 
00:45:27.990 --> 00:45:28.000 align:start position:0%
invite you back very briefly uh on the
 
00:45:38.549 --> 00:45:38.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:40.790 --> 00:45:40.800 align:start position:0%
necessary thank you representative
 
00:45:43.270 --> 00:45:43.280 align:start position:0%
Pearson that is a very pointed question
 
00:45:45.630 --> 00:45:45.640 align:start position:0%
it was a leading question Council it was
 
00:45:47.270 --> 00:45:47.280 align:start position:0%
and and representative Bickford I really
 
00:45:49.829 --> 00:45:49.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate your question because I think
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
what we see in practice every day
 
00:45:56.510 --> 00:45:56.520 align:start position:0%
including a lot of cases in a last few
 
00:45:59.630 --> 00:45:59.640 align:start position:0%
months where kids are getting routed to
 
00:46:03.109 --> 00:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
Juvenile Justice prosecution rather than
 
00:46:06.030 --> 00:46:06.040 align:start position:0%
being given services that the family is
 
00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:09.000 align:start position:0%
desperately begging for is a serious
 
00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920 align:start position:0%
problem that is currently happening
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
under the law right now under the
 
00:46:18.030 --> 00:46:18.040 align:start position:0%
policies under current practice so we do
 
00:46:20.630 --> 00:46:20.640 align:start position:0%
think there is an issue if attorney
 
00:46:22.829 --> 00:46:22.839 align:start position:0%
larabie feels the language she read out
 
00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:26.160 align:start position:0%
which I didn't catch every word of said
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
better what this is trying to say we are
 
00:46:31.829 --> 00:46:31.839 align:start position:0%
all for that but in current practice
 
00:46:33.630 --> 00:46:33.640 align:start position:0%
under the way the statute is currently
 
00:46:36.870 --> 00:46:36.880 align:start position:0%
written this is happening and I
 
00:46:39.670 --> 00:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
appreciate a child can't be forced to
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
engage but I don't think that's what
 
00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:43.240 align:start position:0%
this language is trying to do it is
 
00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
trying to Simply preempt the you said no
 
00:46:50.670 --> 00:46:50.680 align:start position:0%
we're done go to court which is what is
 
00:46:53.030 --> 00:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
happening and also we have lots of laws
 
00:46:54.750 --> 00:46:54.760 align:start position:0%
that Force children to do lots of things
 
00:46:57.549 --> 00:46:57.559 align:start position:0%
because under 169c and 169b they don't
 
00:46:58.710 --> 00:46:58.720 align:start position:0%
have a choice
 
00:47:02.549 --> 00:47:02.559 align:start position:0%
anymore there is a trauma response and a
 
00:47:05.430 --> 00:47:05.440 align:start position:0%
behavioral response for teenagers that
 
00:47:09.630 --> 00:47:09.640 align:start position:0%
is normal y thank you uh I'm not well I
 
00:47:12.750 --> 00:47:12.760 align:start position:0%
guess I am representative Nelson not
 
00:47:15.670 --> 00:47:15.680 align:start position:0%
Nelson representative hang on
 
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:17.680 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman I
 
00:47:20.030 --> 00:47:20.040 align:start position:0%
appreciate your Indulgence um I have a
 
00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:21.150 align:start position:0%
appreciate your Indulgence um I have a
question

00:47:21.150 --> 00:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:24.720 align:start position:0%
about um the representation for the
 
00:47:27.790 --> 00:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
child um in the difference between like
 
00:47:30.190 --> 00:47:30.200 align:start position:0%
a voluntary case as we're talking about
 
00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:32.359 align:start position:0%
here and a core ordered case because
 
00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:35.400 align:start position:0%
current practice is now you the the
 
00:47:37.030 --> 00:47:37.040 align:start position:0%
worker goes out they talk to the the
 
00:47:38.510 --> 00:47:38.520 align:start position:0%
child and the family the family thinks
 
00:47:40.430 --> 00:47:40.440 align:start position:0%
the child need Services the child is not
 
00:47:42.309 --> 00:47:42.319 align:start position:0%
interested and then the next step is to
 
00:47:44.870 --> 00:47:44.880 align:start position:0%
go to court at which time the child gets
 
00:47:48.030 --> 00:47:48.040 align:start position:0%
an attorney or a a guardian ad liem
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
something thank you for that question
 
00:47:52.670 --> 00:47:52.680 align:start position:0%
that is a great point and we do
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
appreciate that within 169b cases that
 
00:47:59.349 --> 00:47:59.359 align:start position:0%
are filed a child is assigned counsel in
 
00:48:03.190 --> 00:48:03.200 align:start position:0%
a 169 D chins case that is filed so not
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
the voluntary case you're correct right
 
00:48:08.109 --> 00:48:08.119 align:start position:0%
they do get an attorney in a 169c case
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
there is a bill pending currently they
 
00:48:12.230 --> 00:48:12.240 align:start position:0%
don't get an attorney right um the role
 
00:48:13.950 --> 00:48:13.960 align:start position:0%
of the attorney is very important we
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
would love for all kids to have
 
00:48:17.710 --> 00:48:17.720 align:start position:0%
attorneys however the danger and the
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
slippery slope that Jason talked about
 
00:48:23.710 --> 00:48:23.720 align:start position:0%
earlier is once that child is in a court
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
proceeding it can be very very hard to
 
00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
get out of that Court proceeding yes
 
00:48:31.870 --> 00:48:31.880 align:start position:0%
they have the option to dismiss it and I
 
00:48:33.630 --> 00:48:33.640 align:start position:0%
don't have the statistics of how often
 
00:48:36.309 --> 00:48:36.319 align:start position:0%
that happens but again as Jason said
 
00:48:39.270 --> 00:48:39.280 align:start position:0%
earlier a voluntary J chins pre any
 
00:48:41.950 --> 00:48:41.960 align:start position:0%
filing at all is completely voluntary
 
00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:44.880 align:start position:0%
but if you had to file first and now you
 
00:48:46.510 --> 00:48:46.520 align:start position:0%
switch to a voluntary there's still a
 
00:48:48.710 --> 00:48:48.720 align:start position:0%
court proceeding happening it can get
 
00:48:51.470 --> 00:48:51.480 align:start position:0%
out of that child in that family's
 
00:48:55.630 --> 00:48:55.640 align:start position:0%
control very quickly a voluntary chin
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
pre- Court would avoid that although we
 
00:49:00.990 --> 00:49:01.000 align:start position:0%
do love when kids get counsel and can
 
00:49:02.549 --> 00:49:02.559 align:start position:0%
tell them they I'm going to call on one
 
00:49:04.230 --> 00:49:04.240 align:start position:0%
more person and then I'm going to close
 
00:49:07.309 --> 00:49:07.319 align:start position:0%
the hearing representative D Simon thank
 
00:49:09.309 --> 00:49:09.319 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you again for
 
00:49:11.390 --> 00:49:11.400 align:start position:0%
all you do and taking my question I'm
 
00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:13.960 align:start position:0%
going to ask you the same question so is
 
00:49:17.390 --> 00:49:17.400 align:start position:0%
it your opinion that this bill will
 
00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:19.910 align:start position:0%
it your opinion that this bill will
enhance

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
enhance
 
00:49:22.950 --> 00:49:22.960 align:start position:0%
169 we believe that language this
 
00:49:24.710 --> 00:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
language or the language that attorney
 
00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:28.400 align:start position:0%
larab be offered would add another layer
 
00:49:30.789 --> 00:49:30.799 align:start position:0%
of trauma informed knowledge and
 
00:49:32.910 --> 00:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
protection for children yes thank you
 
00:49:35.190 --> 00:49:35.200 align:start position:0%
and thank you for coming back and uh
 
00:49:38.109 --> 00:49:38.119 align:start position:0%
this will conclude the hearing on House
 
00:49:44.109 --> 00:49:44.119 align:start position:0%
Bill 1261 and uh OCA likes DHHS does not
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
um we've never faced this
 
00:49:50.589 --> 00:49:50.599 align:start position:0%
before I'm only kidding um it does bring
 
00:49:53.309 --> 00:49:53.319 align:start position:0%
a breath to the subject so we will not
 
00:49:56.990 --> 00:49:57.000 align:start position:0%
be executing this bill today and um
 
00:49:59.829 --> 00:49:59.839 align:start position:0%
members of the committee feel free to
 
00:50:01.990 --> 00:50:02.000 align:start position:0%
contact either or
 
00:50:06.589 --> 00:50:06.599 align:start position:0%
both um sets of of people here um as we
 
00:50:08.630 --> 00:50:08.640 align:start position:0%
come to whatever conclusion we're going
 
00:50:11.270 --> 00:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
to come to when we do execute so thank

representative McGuff outside he's up
 
00:50:22.630 --> 00:50:22.640 align:start position:0%
next with his bill I saw him snatch a
 
00:50:22.640 --> 00:50:23.510 align:start position:0%
next with his bill I saw him snatch a
pink

00:50:23.510 --> 00:50:23.520 align:start position:0%
pink
 
00:50:30.910 --> 00:50:30.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:54.430 --> 00:50:54.440 align:start position:0%

00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:54.349 align:start position:0%
 
there

00:51:54.349 --> 00:51:54.359 align:start position:0%

00:52:14.230 --> 00:52:14.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes The Honorable gentleman
 
00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:19.079 align:start position:0%
from Hillsboro 12 which is my avoidance
 
00:52:21.270 --> 00:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
of mispronouncing your name an act
 
00:52:23.150 --> 00:52:23.160 align:start position:0%
relative to the use of child restraints
 
00:52:26.589 --> 00:52:26.599 align:start position:0%
in schools help me please
 
00:52:27.549 --> 00:52:27.559 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman it's
 
00:52:30.030 --> 00:52:30.040 align:start position:0%
representative MCU Tim MCU from the town
 
00:52:33.670 --> 00:52:33.680 align:start position:0%
of MCU got it thank you yeah not at all
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
like it looks there was an Ian there at
 
00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
one point I guess okay anyhow I'm Tim
 
00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:39.280 align:start position:0%
MCU I represent the town of marac
 
00:52:41.589 --> 00:52:41.599 align:start position:0%
Hillsboro County District 12 and I'm
 
00:52:42.710 --> 00:52:42.720 align:start position:0%
here to talk to you today about
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
increasing a little bit of transparency
 
00:52:46.390 --> 00:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
and doing whatever we can to open some
 
00:52:48.789 --> 00:52:48.799 align:start position:0%
lines of communications clear up
 
00:52:51.950 --> 00:52:51.960 align:start position:0%
questions that happen when child
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
children students in our schools are
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:56.069 align:start position:0%
children students in our schools are
restrained

00:52:56.069 --> 00:52:56.079 align:start position:0%
restrained
 
00:52:58.470 --> 00:52:58.480 align:start position:0%
yes restrained believe it or not so the
 
00:53:00.510 --> 00:53:00.520 align:start position:0%
bill proposes some crucial modifications
 
00:53:03.430 --> 00:53:03.440 align:start position:0%
to 126 which relate to the condition of
 
00:53:05.510 --> 00:53:05.520 align:start position:0%
seclusions and restraints and and I know
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
the committee is somewhat familiar
 
00:53:10.230 --> 00:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
because last year we passed um a couple
 
00:53:13.430 --> 00:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
of things one was to Outlaw prone
 
00:53:16.510 --> 00:53:16.520 align:start position:0%
restraints and one was to clarify the
 
00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:18.200 align:start position:0%
reporting form to make it a little more
 
00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
Universal and that has worked
 
00:53:24.190 --> 00:53:24.200 align:start position:0%
well but when I learned that there had
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
been 1,000
 
00:53:29.230 --> 00:53:29.240 align:start position:0%
434 instances where students were
 
00:53:31.870 --> 00:53:31.880 align:start position:0%
restrained against their will spe
 
00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
specifically in do there were 202 cases
 
00:53:37.630 --> 00:53:37.640 align:start position:0%
nashille Broad Street School
 
00:53:40.829 --> 00:53:40.839 align:start position:0%
169 with Hanover Danville and Hudson
 
00:53:43.030 --> 00:53:43.040 align:start position:0%
rounding out the top
 
00:53:46.190 --> 00:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
five I thought you know this is uh
 
00:53:48.950 --> 00:53:48.960 align:start position:0%
pretty astonishing and we need to do
 
00:53:50.349 --> 00:53:50.359 align:start position:0%
something about it or at least have a
 
00:53:52.910 --> 00:53:52.920 align:start position:0%
look into it so look into it we did a
 
00:53:54.750 --> 00:53:54.760 align:start position:0%
constituent brought this information to
 
00:53:57.870 --> 00:53:57.880 align:start position:0%
me uh she's here with some of her uh
 
00:53:59.309 --> 00:53:59.319 align:start position:0%
colleagues and friends who will tell you
 
00:54:03.150 --> 00:54:03.160 align:start position:0%
their stories as well um so myself and
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
the other marac Representatives got
 
00:54:07.390 --> 00:54:07.400 align:start position:0%
together met with the school dist
 
00:54:08.589 --> 00:54:08.599 align:start position:0%
District to see what was happening in
 
00:54:11.109 --> 00:54:11.119 align:start position:0%
marac and we found out that they had
 
00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:14.920 align:start position:0%
already documented 49 cases of restraint
 
00:54:16.950 --> 00:54:16.960 align:start position:0%
now as I'm sure this knowledgeable
 
00:54:19.589 --> 00:54:19.599 align:start position:0%
committee knows restraint can be fair
 
00:54:22.309 --> 00:54:22.319 align:start position:0%
Fairly wide variety of practices from
 
00:54:26.030 --> 00:54:26.040 align:start position:0%
handholding you know sort of placing arm
 
00:54:27.309 --> 00:54:27.319 align:start position:0%
on the elbow I mean I think you get the
 
00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:28.720 align:start position:0%
idea it runs the full gamut and I think
 
00:54:30.670 --> 00:54:30.680 align:start position:0%
you already are pretty familiar with
 
00:54:34.230 --> 00:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
with it so with 49 cases and this many
 
00:54:36.750 --> 00:54:36.760 align:start position:0%
cases we did question how many of those
 
00:54:38.670 --> 00:54:38.680 align:start position:0%
are the same student and how many of of
 
00:54:41.230 --> 00:54:41.240 align:start position:0%
them are the most severe and that's
 
00:54:44.430 --> 00:54:44.440 align:start position:0%
virtually impossible to tell um how you
 
00:54:46.549 --> 00:54:46.559 align:start position:0%
know unless you unless the doe and those
 
00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:48.880 align:start position:0%
were doe figures unless you went through
 
00:54:51.069 --> 00:54:51.079 align:start position:0%
and tried to parse them out and call
 
00:54:53.910 --> 00:54:53.920 align:start position:0%
them out but one thing that you could do
 
00:54:56.589 --> 00:54:56.599 align:start position:0%
is utilize what's already in 189 I think
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
it's 18
 
00:55:02.950 --> 00:55:02.960 align:start position:0%
18968 the IEP uh and it might be D or C
 
00:55:04.390 --> 00:55:04.400 align:start position:0%
or D or something it's pretty far down
 
00:55:07.109 --> 00:55:07.119 align:start position:0%
on that long list of things uh you can
 
00:55:10.109 --> 00:55:10.119 align:start position:0%
utilize audiovisual recording already
 
00:55:15.710 --> 00:55:15.720 align:start position:0%
and this puts that utilization ability
 
00:55:20.470 --> 00:55:20.480 align:start position:0%
into the seclusion statute right um with
 
00:55:22.950 --> 00:55:22.960 align:start position:0%
the appropriate guard rails so that you
 
00:55:25.309 --> 00:55:25.319 align:start position:0%
know you don't have to set up a camera
 
00:55:27.510 --> 00:55:27.520 align:start position:0%
and a and a boom mic uh at the first
 
00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:29.280 align:start position:0%
sign of trouble right obviously that's
 
00:55:33.109 --> 00:55:33.119 align:start position:0%
completely impractical safety first um I
 
00:55:34.430 --> 00:55:34.440 align:start position:0%
give you a little bit of of my own
 
00:55:36.990 --> 00:55:37.000 align:start position:0%
background I'm 30 years a paramedic and
 
00:55:39.950 --> 00:55:39.960 align:start position:0%
I've dealt with hundreds of hostile
 
00:55:43.829 --> 00:55:43.839 align:start position:0%
patients both adults and children um
 
00:55:46.430 --> 00:55:46.440 align:start position:0%
from the you know PhD Professor that
 
00:55:49.190 --> 00:55:49.200 align:start position:0%
everybody loves that we found uh naked
 
00:55:50.750 --> 00:55:50.760 align:start position:0%
in his front yard you know beating the
 
00:55:52.430 --> 00:55:52.440 align:start position:0%
heck out of the police officers and I
 
00:55:54.109 --> 00:55:54.119 align:start position:0%
mean beating the heck out of them this
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
is before the days of non-lethal uh
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
things and it was up to us to restrain
 
00:56:02.069 --> 00:56:02.079 align:start position:0%
them chemically uh so I've pretty much
 
00:56:04.309 --> 00:56:04.319 align:start position:0%
seen the gamut and including teaching
 
00:56:06.029 --> 00:56:06.039 align:start position:0%
the gold standard crisis censor
 
00:56:07.710 --> 00:56:07.720 align:start position:0%
intervention and deescalation courses at
 
00:56:10.470 --> 00:56:10.480 align:start position:0%
the University level so this is a a
 
00:56:12.270 --> 00:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
subject that I'm pretty familiar with
 
00:56:13.910 --> 00:56:13.920 align:start position:0%
what I wasn't familiar with was how
 
00:56:16.270 --> 00:56:16.280 align:start position:0%
often it happens in the schools to our
 
00:56:19.349 --> 00:56:19.359 align:start position:0%
kids and that padded rooms exist in many
 
00:56:21.589 --> 00:56:21.599 align:start position:0%
many schools that was new to
 
00:56:23.870 --> 00:56:23.880 align:start position:0%
me uh so when we looked into it a little
 
00:56:25.950 --> 00:56:25.960 align:start position:0%
bit further despite the improvements
 
00:56:27.029 --> 00:56:27.039 align:start position:0%
made last year in the reporting
 
00:56:28.349 --> 00:56:28.359 align:start position:0%
requirements and the prohibition of
 
00:56:31.150 --> 00:56:31.160 align:start position:0%
prone restraints there the issue still
 
00:56:33.710 --> 00:56:33.720 align:start position:0%
persists and it happens just too often
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
in in New Hampshire in New Hampshire
 
00:56:37.789 --> 00:56:37.799 align:start position:0%
schools so I think this bill is a good
 
00:56:39.349 --> 00:56:39.359 align:start position:0%
step forward towards addressing those
 
00:56:41.230 --> 00:56:41.240 align:start position:0%
transparency concerns especially for the
 
00:56:43.029 --> 00:56:43.039 align:start position:0%
non-verbal patient that comes home and
 
00:56:45.630 --> 00:56:45.640 align:start position:0%
tells mom and dad or the guardian what
 
00:56:48.349 --> 00:56:48.359 align:start position:0%
happened and they have a difficulty
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
communicating exactly what happened um
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
one case we heard about um such a
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
student who is less communicative at
 
00:56:58.430 --> 00:56:58.440 align:start position:0%
least in
 
00:57:01.390 --> 00:57:01.400 align:start position:0%
school uh claimed to have been treated
 
00:57:03.430 --> 00:57:03.440 align:start position:0%
fairly harshly and restrained harshly
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
and secluded they reviewed the hallway
 
00:57:07.710 --> 00:57:07.720 align:start position:0%
camera and that was not at all the case
 
00:57:09.510 --> 00:57:09.520 align:start position:0%
this the staff were completely
 
00:57:11.430 --> 00:57:11.440 align:start position:0%
appropriate had not laid a hand on them
 
00:57:13.190 --> 00:57:13.200 align:start position:0%
so it really works both ways and it
 
00:57:15.990 --> 00:57:16.000 align:start position:0%
truly does because I I if I had to guess
 
00:57:18.029 --> 00:57:18.039 align:start position:0%
from the research I've done it's not
 
00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
50/50 but there's a pretty significant
 
00:57:23.069 --> 00:57:23.079 align:start position:0%
percentage of time when the stories
 
00:57:26.150 --> 00:57:26.160 align:start position:0%
don't match up well this recording on
 
00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:27.480 align:start position:0%
YouTube there's not going to be any
 
00:57:29.990 --> 00:57:30.000 align:start position:0%
doubt what I said to you today right no
 
00:57:32.390 --> 00:57:32.400 align:start position:0%
no doubt I mean it is a very very
 
00:57:36.349 --> 00:57:36.359 align:start position:0%
clear uh way to preserve evidence and to
 
00:57:38.069 --> 00:57:38.079 align:start position:0%
help open those lines of
 
00:57:41.470 --> 00:57:41.480 align:start position:0%
communication so that's what the bill
 
00:57:43.750 --> 00:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
does and I'm happy to take any questions
 
00:57:45.710 --> 00:57:45.720 align:start position:0%
and let you hear from the folks behind
 
00:57:47.950 --> 00:57:47.960 align:start position:0%
us who have plenty to tell you
 
00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:49.710 align:start position:0%
us who have plenty to tell you
representative

00:57:49.710 --> 00:57:49.720 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:57:52.870 --> 00:57:52.880 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you Mr chairman I worked as
 
00:57:57.549 --> 00:57:57.559 align:start position:0%
a special needs uh um par educator quite
 
00:58:01.430 --> 00:58:01.440 align:start position:0%
a few years ago and the population that
 
00:58:02.549 --> 00:58:02.559 align:start position:0%
I worked
 
00:58:06.430 --> 00:58:06.440 align:start position:0%
with um in Special Needs involves some
 
00:58:07.309 --> 00:58:07.319 align:start position:0%
of the
 
00:58:10.589 --> 00:58:10.599 align:start position:0%
violent there was a lot of violence and
 
00:58:14.190 --> 00:58:14.200 align:start position:0%
you could be in a very quiet classroom
 
00:58:16.870 --> 00:58:16.880 align:start position:0%
and then all of a sudden a student would
 
00:58:19.710 --> 00:58:19.720 align:start position:0%
jump out of its seat out of his seat and
 
00:58:22.190 --> 00:58:22.200 align:start position:0%
start attacking another student
 
00:58:24.069 --> 00:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
representative move to a question please
 
00:58:24.079 --> 00:58:26.950 align:start position:0%
representative move to a question please
okay

00:58:26.950 --> 00:58:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:32.510 --> 00:58:32.520 align:start position:0%
this bill is asking to put in uh Rec
 
00:58:32.520 --> 00:58:34.390 align:start position:0%
this bill is asking to put in uh Rec
recording

00:58:34.390 --> 00:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
recording
 
00:58:39.950 --> 00:58:39.960 align:start position:0%
materials um to record the restraining
 
00:58:43.349 --> 00:58:43.359 align:start position:0%
process you can't set that up so are you
 
00:58:47.309 --> 00:58:47.319 align:start position:0%
is this setting up the scenario to have
 
00:58:50.029 --> 00:58:50.039 align:start position:0%
maybe video recorders like they do with
 
00:58:52.150 --> 00:58:52.160 align:start position:0%
the police department on the teachers
 
00:58:54.109 --> 00:58:54.119 align:start position:0%
and the teachers AIDS thank you
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
representative pic for your question um
 
00:58:58.549 --> 00:58:58.559 align:start position:0%
fascinating idea no I hadn't thought of
 
00:59:01.990 --> 00:59:02.000 align:start position:0%
that I wouldn't be surprised if in some
 
00:59:06.670 --> 00:59:06.680 align:start position:0%
of those most serious violent situations
 
00:59:07.710 --> 00:59:07.720 align:start position:0%
that a
 
00:59:10.789 --> 00:59:10.799 align:start position:0%
responding administrator might choose to
 
00:59:12.829 --> 00:59:12.839 align:start position:0%
come equipped with body cams if the
 
00:59:16.069 --> 00:59:16.079 align:start position:0%
school decides to do that that's not
 
00:59:17.630 --> 00:59:17.640 align:start position:0%
specifically in here in fact there's
 
00:59:19.430 --> 00:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
specific I think I mentioned them guard
 
00:59:21.309 --> 00:59:21.319 align:start position:0%
rails about as soon as practical and
 
00:59:23.750 --> 00:59:23.760 align:start position:0%
safety is first like deescalation
 
00:59:26.150 --> 00:59:26.160 align:start position:0%
deregulation get to a safe place some of
 
00:59:29.630 --> 00:59:29.640 align:start position:0%
that is first if it's practical uh and I
 
00:59:30.910 --> 00:59:30.920 align:start position:0%
don't think it will be difficult to
 
00:59:32.349 --> 00:59:32.359 align:start position:0%
determine whether it's practical because
 
00:59:34.029 --> 00:59:34.039 align:start position:0%
there's a fairly extensive form that you
 
00:59:35.789 --> 00:59:35.799 align:start position:0%
fill out detailing that everybody fills
 
00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:39.200 align:start position:0%
out so you have several versions of it
 
00:59:41.789 --> 00:59:41.799 align:start position:0%
um the detailing exactly what happened
 
00:59:44.630 --> 00:59:44.640 align:start position:0%
so I think it's then it's it will be
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
possible to tell whether it was
 
00:59:48.870 --> 00:59:48.880 align:start position:0%
practical or not the emphasis um for
 
00:59:52.230 --> 00:59:52.240 align:start position:0%
this is also on exclusion or a seclusion
 
00:59:56.910 --> 00:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
sorry not every uh Place had from what I
 
00:59:59.470 --> 00:59:59.480 align:start position:0%
understand has audio video monitoring uh
 
01:00:01.390 --> 01:00:01.400 align:start position:0%
they should have at a minimum one: one
 
01:00:05.150 --> 01:00:05.160 align:start position:0%
monitoring and should be able to see the
 
01:00:08.630 --> 01:00:08.640 align:start position:0%
secluded student at all times um but if
 
01:00:10.670 --> 01:00:10.680 align:start position:0%
there were uh if there was audio video
 
01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:12.240 align:start position:0%
monitoring even just somebody's cell
 
01:00:14.589 --> 01:00:14.599 align:start position:0%
phone not someone's personal cell phone
 
01:00:16.349 --> 01:00:16.359 align:start position:0%
don't worry I'm not suggesting that
 
01:00:18.270 --> 01:00:18.280 align:start position:0%
staff be told to use their personal cell
 
01:00:22.349 --> 01:00:22.359 align:start position:0%
phones but I I think it's a a manageable
 
01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:24.960 align:start position:0%
we worked we went around around a bit on
 
01:00:27.630 --> 01:00:27.640 align:start position:0%
the language to make it specific and and
 
01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:31.240 align:start position:0%
narrow and uh
 
01:00:33.270 --> 01:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
implementable does this speak to the
 
01:00:36.349 --> 01:00:36.359 align:start position:0%
question of each School having a special
 
01:00:39.069 --> 01:00:39.079 align:start position:0%
room already set up for the video and
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
the unruly person would be taken to that
 
01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.230 align:start position:0%
the unruly person would be taken to that
or

01:00:43.230 --> 01:00:43.240 align:start position:0%
or
 
01:00:46.349 --> 01:00:46.359 align:start position:0%
given the variety of how this might
 
01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:50.720 align:start position:0%
occur do are you contemplating uh video
 
01:00:52.430 --> 01:00:52.440 align:start position:0%
recordings in each
 
01:00:56.510 --> 01:00:56.520 align:start position:0%
room so I I am am contemplating that U
 
01:00:58.230 --> 01:00:58.240 align:start position:0%
there should be audio video recording in
 
01:01:00.549 --> 01:01:00.559 align:start position:0%
each seclusion room I think many of them
 
01:01:02.190 --> 01:01:02.200 align:start position:0%
already have that some of the experts
 
01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:03.680 align:start position:0%
that have been into many more of them
 
01:01:06.069 --> 01:01:06.079 align:start position:0%
than I have uh we'll be able to speak to
 
01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:08.200 align:start position:0%
that also what we found is there's a lot
 
01:01:10.349 --> 01:01:10.359 align:start position:0%
of hallway cameras and common area
 
01:01:12.870 --> 01:01:12.880 align:start position:0%
cameras these days
 
01:01:16.029 --> 01:01:16.039 align:start position:0%
um and uh so that those are those are
 
01:01:17.510 --> 01:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
useful they're really not part of the
 
01:01:20.109 --> 01:01:20.119 align:start position:0%
bill because the
 
01:01:23.430 --> 01:01:23.440 align:start position:0%
IEP nothing nothing in the the languages
 
01:01:25.270 --> 01:01:25.280 align:start position:0%
nothing in this passage shall preclude
 
01:01:27.270 --> 01:01:27.280 align:start position:0%
the use of audiovisual instruction in
 
01:01:29.630 --> 01:01:29.640 align:start position:0%
the course of or audiovisual monitoring
 
01:01:31.549 --> 01:01:31.559 align:start position:0%
in the course of instruction that's the
 
01:01:34.510 --> 01:01:34.520 align:start position:0%
IEP language what what this bill does is
 
01:01:39.549 --> 01:01:39.559 align:start position:0%
lets a parent request that be utilized
 
01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:42.319 align:start position:0%
in the event of a restraining or
 
01:01:44.069 --> 01:01:44.079 align:start position:0%
secluding type
 
01:01:47.230 --> 01:01:47.240 align:start position:0%
situation representative D Simon thank
 
01:01:49.470 --> 01:01:49.480 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman thank you for bringing
 
01:01:52.109 --> 01:01:52.119 align:start position:0%
this to us in taking my
 
01:01:57.150 --> 01:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
question um starting on line 22 it read
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
your bill reads as soon as practical
 
01:02:04.309 --> 01:02:04.319 align:start position:0%
pursuant to RSA 189 col 68 each use of
 
01:02:06.870 --> 01:02:06.880 align:start position:0%
restraint shall be visually and
 
01:02:10.510 --> 01:02:10.520 align:start position:0%
auditorally recorded if such method of
 
01:02:13.190 --> 01:02:13.200 align:start position:0%
recording is included in the students
 
01:02:13.200 --> 01:02:14.589 align:start position:0%
recording is included in the students
indivi

01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:14.599 align:start position:0%
indivi
 
01:02:18.670 --> 01:02:18.680 align:start position:0%
individualized education program or
 
01:02:21.150 --> 01:02:21.160 align:start position:0%
accommodation plan who makes that
 
01:02:23.549 --> 01:02:23.559 align:start position:0%
decision as to who shall and who shall
 
01:02:27.630 --> 01:02:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:30.829 --> 01:02:30.839 align:start position:0%
recorded the parent the parent makes the
 
01:02:34.029 --> 01:02:34.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.789 --> 01:02:37.799 align:start position:0%
AP thank you so is this the case that
 
01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
students in general this does not apply
 
01:02:42.349 --> 01:02:42.359 align:start position:0%
to only those with
 
01:02:44.829 --> 01:02:44.839 align:start position:0%
IEPs am I reading it that right yes I
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
believe you are okay thank you yeah uh
 
01:02:49.670 --> 01:02:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative panic and then thank you
 
01:02:52.910 --> 01:02:52.920 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh one more question uh so
 
01:02:55.390 --> 01:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
these students that have IEP they they
 
01:02:59.630 --> 01:02:59.640 align:start position:0%
are obviously blended into a regular uh
 
01:03:04.390 --> 01:03:04.400 align:start position:0%
classroom um the sometimes the restraint
 
01:03:05.990 --> 01:03:06.000 align:start position:0%
has to happen
 
01:03:07.950 --> 01:03:07.960 align:start position:0%
immediately so you can't go out there
 
01:03:09.589 --> 01:03:09.599 align:start position:0%
and start setting up cameras and
 
01:03:12.950 --> 01:03:12.960 align:start position:0%
everything else
 
01:03:15.910 --> 01:03:15.920 align:start position:0%
so what is your proposal for something
 
01:03:19.549 --> 01:03:19.559 align:start position:0%
like that I mean what is this spill
 
01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:22.599 align:start position:0%
cover thank you for uh helping me
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
clarify uh because the bill does cover
 
01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:26.960 align:start position:0%
that I mentioned a couple of times uh in
 
01:03:30.029 --> 01:03:30.039 align:start position:0%
the in first sentence as soon as
 
01:03:32.549 --> 01:03:32.559 align:start position:0%
practicable right which so so that
 
01:03:36.109 --> 01:03:36.119 align:start position:0%
already puts that guard rail uh and I
 
01:03:38.589 --> 01:03:38.599 align:start position:0%
think it's important that there be
 
01:03:40.549 --> 01:03:40.559 align:start position:0%
flexibility for the teachers and the
 
01:03:42.230 --> 01:03:42.240 align:start position:0%
administrators they have to protect
 
01:03:45.470 --> 01:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
themselves I've been you know smacked in
 
01:03:46.870 --> 01:03:46.880 align:start position:0%
the face once by someone who I thought
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
was unconscious in the middle of a
 
01:03:51.430 --> 01:03:51.440 align:start position:0%
frozen lake uh I'm I'm now much more
 
01:03:54.269 --> 01:03:54.279 align:start position:0%
hand aware uh in approaching an
 
01:03:56.990 --> 01:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
unconscious patient so you know Safety
 
01:03:58.589 --> 01:03:58.599 align:start position:0%
First and I think that allows that as
 
01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:01.960 align:start position:0%
soon as practicable so initial Outburst
 
01:04:04.069 --> 01:04:04.079 align:start position:0%
may be the most or at least one of the
 
01:04:08.230 --> 01:04:08.240 align:start position:0%
more violent parts of the episode and so
 
01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:10.720 align:start position:0%
you've got to get this person restrained
 
01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:13.559 align:start position:0%
immediately uh so that part of the
 
01:04:16.589 --> 01:04:16.599 align:start position:0%
encounter possibly would not be recorded
 
01:04:18.990 --> 01:04:19.000 align:start position:0%
indeed yeah and and I don't I don't have
 
01:04:20.510 --> 01:04:20.520 align:start position:0%
the answer for that actually thank you
 
01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.190 align:start position:0%
the answer for that actually thank you
representative

01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:26.150 --> 01:04:26.160 align:start position:0%
patrino thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:04:27.390 --> 01:04:27.400 align:start position:0%
you representative for taking my
 
01:04:29.630 --> 01:04:29.640 align:start position:0%
question I just need some clarification
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
students with IEPs are mainstreamed and
 
01:04:34.390 --> 01:04:34.400 align:start position:0%
they're in the general population does
 
01:04:37.589 --> 01:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
this mean that students with IEPs um you
 
01:04:40.230 --> 01:04:40.240 align:start position:0%
would have to have Visual and auditory
 
01:04:41.910 --> 01:04:41.920 align:start position:0%
recordings in every single classroom in
 
01:04:44.309 --> 01:04:44.319 align:start position:0%
the building to accommodate those
 
01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:46.160 align:start position:0%
students so in effect every classroom
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
would have to have these recording
 
01:04:50.109 --> 01:04:50.119 align:start position:0%
devices thank you for the question repo
 
01:04:51.829 --> 01:04:51.839 align:start position:0%
represent patrino that's a that's a good
 
01:04:54.190 --> 01:04:54.200 align:start position:0%
question um and the answer is no I don't
 
01:04:57.630 --> 01:04:57.640 align:start position:0%
don't think so um but we are not looking
 
01:05:00.910 --> 01:05:00.920 align:start position:0%
to reinvent the IEP statute that already
 
01:05:03.829 --> 01:05:03.839 align:start position:0%
exists right the the language is
 
01:05:03.839 --> 01:05:05.549 align:start position:0%
exists right the the language is
specific

01:05:05.549 --> 01:05:05.559 align:start position:0%
specific
 
01:05:05.559 --> 01:05:07.750 align:start position:0%
specific
in

01:05:07.750 --> 01:05:07.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:05:11.230 --> 01:05:11.240 align:start position:0%
189 uh way down at the
 
01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.910 align:start position:0%
189 uh way down at the
bottom

01:05:12.910 --> 01:05:12.920 align:start position:0%
bottom
 
01:05:17.670 --> 01:05:17.680 align:start position:0%
9 68 VD actually it might be VC in fact
 
01:05:20.870 --> 01:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
that could be a typo um that
 
01:05:22.430 --> 01:05:22.440 align:start position:0%
specifically says nothing in this
 
01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:24.440 align:start position:0%
passage shall preclude the use of audio
 
01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:25.349 align:start position:0%
passage shall preclude the use of audio
visual

01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
visual
 
01:05:27.470 --> 01:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
recording so when representative Mooney
 
01:05:29.670 --> 01:05:29.680 align:start position:0%
and I were word smithing it with some of
 
01:05:33.710 --> 01:05:33.720 align:start position:0%
the SAU staff that was the uh between
 
01:05:35.549 --> 01:05:35.559 align:start position:0%
the three of us four of us and OLS it
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
appeared to be the best utilization of
 
01:05:43.510 --> 01:05:43.520 align:start position:0%
language representative Raymond thank
 
01:05:44.589 --> 01:05:44.599 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman and thank you
 
01:05:46.670 --> 01:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
representative for taking my question my
 
01:05:48.990 --> 01:05:49.000 align:start position:0%
question is in regards to how this bill
 
01:05:51.390 --> 01:05:51.400 align:start position:0%
would interact with the uh furpa
 
01:05:55.069 --> 01:05:55.079 align:start position:0%
standard so the federal uh federal
 
01:05:58.190 --> 01:05:58.200 align:start position:0%
education privacy records act so
 
01:06:02.150 --> 01:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
students have rights to privacy and So
 
01:06:04.269 --> 01:06:04.279 align:start position:0%
currently under furpa if you have
 
01:06:06.069 --> 01:06:06.079 align:start position:0%
multiple students engaged in an incident
 
01:06:08.470 --> 01:06:08.480 align:start position:0%
that has caught on film all of the
 
01:06:10.910 --> 01:06:10.920 align:start position:0%
parents of all of those students have a
 
01:06:15.150 --> 01:06:15.160 align:start position:0%
right to view that film so under this
 
01:06:17.430 --> 01:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
statute if we are now filming incidents
 
01:06:20.670 --> 01:06:20.680 align:start position:0%
where a child who has an IEP and has now
 
01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:22.109 align:start position:0%
where a child who has an IEP and has now
Ada

01:06:22.109 --> 01:06:22.119 align:start position:0%
Ada
 
01:06:24.190 --> 01:06:24.200 align:start position:0%
protections has had an outburst but
 
01:06:26.430 --> 01:06:26.440 align:start position:0%
there are other students involved in the
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
Outburst are we potentially impacting
 
01:06:32.390 --> 01:06:32.400 align:start position:0%
the privacy of that student who had the
 
01:06:34.950 --> 01:06:34.960 align:start position:0%
Outburst by making these records now
 
01:06:36.910 --> 01:06:36.920 align:start position:0%
available to all the other parents of
 
01:06:38.990 --> 01:06:39.000 align:start position:0%
students who don't have the right to
 
01:06:41.670 --> 01:06:41.680 align:start position:0%
know that that child has an IAP so thank
 
01:06:43.349 --> 01:06:43.359 align:start position:0%
you representative Raymond it's also a
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
very good question uh and there's a lot
 
01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:47.880 align:start position:0%
of gray areas in in this but that's why
 
01:06:50.430 --> 01:06:50.440 align:start position:0%
we have a giant list of privacy
 
01:06:53.390 --> 01:06:53.400 align:start position:0%
Protections in 126 it's all goes all the
 
01:06:54.910 --> 01:06:54.920 align:start position:0%
way down to
 
01:06:57.950 --> 01:06:57.960 align:start position:0%
well at least like V let mean in the in
 
01:07:00.990 --> 01:07:01.000 align:start position:0%
the alphabet uh so there's a a host of
 
01:07:03.630 --> 01:07:03.640 align:start position:0%
those so I I I don't think any of us
 
01:07:06.430 --> 01:07:06.440 align:start position:0%
could honestly say for certain that a
 
01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:09.160 align:start position:0%
background student walking down the hall
 
01:07:11.670 --> 01:07:11.680 align:start position:0%
or you know that they encounter in
 
01:07:13.589 --> 01:07:13.599 align:start position:0%
passing might
 
01:07:15.910 --> 01:07:15.920 align:start position:0%
be um
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
videotaped they also might videotaped by
 
01:07:21.589 --> 01:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
the existing hallway or exterior cameras
 
01:07:24.950 --> 01:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
um I would say it wouldn't be
 
01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:29.359 align:start position:0%
unreasonable to exclude the provision of
 
01:07:34.150 --> 01:07:34.160 align:start position:0%
the audio video material to the parent
 
01:07:36.829 --> 01:07:36.839 align:start position:0%
of Guardian of a student who was not
 
01:07:38.990 --> 01:07:39.000 align:start position:0%
really subject of it who just you know
 
01:07:40.630 --> 01:07:40.640 align:start position:0%
is an extra in the movie if you will
 
01:07:43.910 --> 01:07:43.920 align:start position:0%
right just in in passing I'm not sure
 
01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:45.640 align:start position:0%
how you do that I think we have a lot of
 
01:07:47.589 --> 01:07:47.599 align:start position:0%
privacy Protections in 126 now it's all
 
01:07:49.589 --> 01:07:49.599 align:start position:0%
about that uh or I could be seeing
 
01:07:52.390 --> 01:07:52.400 align:start position:0%
actually 189 uh 189 sorry it's
 
01:07:54.510 --> 01:07:54.520 align:start position:0%
18968 so follow follow up if I might
 
01:07:57.150 --> 01:07:57.160 align:start position:0%
follow up yes thank you Mr chairman so
 
01:07:58.950 --> 01:07:58.960 align:start position:0%
I'm envisioning CU right now we do have
 
01:08:01.510 --> 01:08:01.520 align:start position:0%
surveillance in I'm from naswa U we have
 
01:08:04.109 --> 01:08:04.119 align:start position:0%
surveillance quite a bit at a extreme
 
01:08:07.269 --> 01:08:07.279 align:start position:0%
cost to the taxpayer of for the common
 
01:08:08.670 --> 01:08:08.680 align:start position:0%
areas of the building but not
 
01:08:10.750 --> 01:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily in classrooms so I'm
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
envisioning a situation where a child
 
01:08:16.349 --> 01:08:16.359 align:start position:0%
has a behavioral event in a classroom
 
01:08:19.070 --> 01:08:19.080 align:start position:0%
they you know uh flip over their desk
 
01:08:21.229 --> 01:08:21.239 align:start position:0%
they throw some shoes multiple students
 
01:08:24.110 --> 01:08:24.120 align:start position:0%
are impacted be by this because they are
 
01:08:26.990 --> 01:08:27.000 align:start position:0%
in the vicinity of this child and as a
 
01:08:28.709 --> 01:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
parent of the child who has been
 
01:08:31.229 --> 01:08:31.239 align:start position:0%
impacted by the child who H who's having
 
01:08:34.110 --> 01:08:34.120 align:start position:0%
the Outburst Behavior do I have a right
 
01:08:38.149 --> 01:08:38.159 align:start position:0%
to view the video of what happened I I
 
01:08:40.749 --> 01:08:40.759 align:start position:0%
think you probably do if your child was
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
materially impacted like injured enough
 
01:08:45.669 --> 01:08:45.679 align:start position:0%
you know bruised injured even
 
01:08:48.309 --> 01:08:48.319 align:start position:0%
psychologically damaged I think that
 
01:08:49.590 --> 01:08:49.600 align:start position:0%
that would only be fair but I can tell
 
01:08:50.910 --> 01:08:50.920 align:start position:0%
you this I'm glad you mentioned you were
 
01:08:53.390 --> 01:08:53.400 align:start position:0%
from naswa NASA broads Elementary School
 
01:08:56.829 --> 01:08:56.839 align:start position:0%
is number two on the list right 169
 
01:08:59.709 --> 01:08:59.719 align:start position:0%
times and they implemented audiovisual
 
01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:01.400 align:start position:0%
surveillance guess what happened to the
 
01:09:02.510 --> 01:09:02.520 align:start position:0%
use of
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
restraints well I'll answer my own
 
01:09:06.470 --> 01:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
question it went down right but our
 
01:09:09.030 --> 01:09:09.040 align:start position:0%
audio video is in the seclusion it's not
 
01:09:11.669 --> 01:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
in the class rooms because we're we're
 
01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:14.560 align:start position:0%
managing the privacy and just to mention
 
01:09:17.990 --> 01:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
Broad Street Elementary has a um a
 
01:09:20.950 --> 01:09:20.960 align:start position:0%
special needs program for children who
 
01:09:22.430 --> 01:09:22.440 align:start position:0%
would otherwise be placed out of
 
01:09:24.669 --> 01:09:24.679 align:start position:0%
District so we actually children from
 
01:09:26.070 --> 01:09:26.080 align:start position:0%
all over the city and from other
 
01:09:29.149 --> 01:09:29.159 align:start position:0%
districts into that school to provide
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
special services so that they don't get
 
01:09:33.630 --> 01:09:33.640 align:start position:0%
put out of district and in our case
 
01:09:35.630 --> 01:09:35.640 align:start position:0%
typically out of state so yeah in In
 
01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:37.400 align:start position:0%
fairness it's higher on the list because
 
01:09:38.789 --> 01:09:38.799 align:start position:0%
you have a higher percentage that that
 
01:09:41.189 --> 01:09:41.199 align:start position:0%
is true uh the most interesting point in
 
01:09:42.709 --> 01:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
my opinion on Broad Street Elementary
 
01:09:45.990 --> 01:09:46.000 align:start position:0%
School is that when they started using
 
01:09:48.110 --> 01:09:48.120 align:start position:0%
audiovisual monitoring the numbers went
 
01:09:51.789 --> 01:09:51.799 align:start position:0%
down a and the the friction right it's
 
01:09:54.910 --> 01:09:54.920 align:start position:0%
to me it's the the the communication and
 
01:09:56.630 --> 01:09:56.640 align:start position:0%
the friction between parents and
 
01:09:59.430 --> 01:09:59.440 align:start position:0%
Educators is just can really be awful
 
01:10:02.790 --> 01:10:02.800 align:start position:0%
and and awful in with kids with IEPs
 
01:10:05.630 --> 01:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
right we know like that's that's often
 
01:10:08.189 --> 01:10:08.199 align:start position:0%
where the source of trouble is and if
 
01:10:10.270 --> 01:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
you can just say listen you know your
 
01:10:12.149 --> 01:10:12.159 align:start position:0%
child threw two chairs through a window
 
01:10:13.910 --> 01:10:13.920 align:start position:0%
and I know we wrote that down but let me
 
01:10:16.430 --> 01:10:16.440 align:start position:0%
show it to you right I think I think the
 
01:10:18.910 --> 01:10:18.920 align:start position:0%
discussion ends there and that's I think
 
01:10:20.430 --> 01:10:20.440 align:start position:0%
helpful for everyone get back to let
 
01:10:23.270 --> 01:10:23.280 align:start position:0%
Educators get back to educating and
 
01:10:25.110 --> 01:10:25.120 align:start position:0%
anyway it's not I don't think there's
 
01:10:27.070 --> 01:10:27.080 align:start position:0%
any perfect solution I think this is an
 
01:10:29.270 --> 01:10:29.280 align:start position:0%
improvement thank you for your time
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here
 
01:10:35.950 --> 01:10:35.960 align:start position:0%
and taking our questions so I think that
 
01:10:38.270 --> 01:10:38.280 align:start position:0%
um that representative Raymond has has
 
01:10:39.550 --> 01:10:39.560 align:start position:0%
covered the area that we're worried
 
01:10:42.750 --> 01:10:42.760 align:start position:0%
about with uh privacy protections but
 
01:10:44.910 --> 01:10:44.920 align:start position:0%
also just in going over the wording of
 
01:10:46.590 --> 01:10:46.600 align:start position:0%
this bill and maybe some other hiccups
 
01:10:49.430 --> 01:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
here one of the things it says um under
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
section two but it says that
 
01:10:54.310 --> 01:10:54.320 align:start position:0%
the on contacting the parents that you
 
01:10:56.270 --> 01:10:56.280 align:start position:0%
would contact the parents prior to the
 
01:10:59.709 --> 01:10:59.719 align:start position:0%
use of this I'm I'm just wondering that
 
01:11:02.070 --> 01:11:02.080 align:start position:0%
particular complication it's almost like
 
01:11:04.910 --> 01:11:04.920 align:start position:0%
if there's an outburst we have to then
 
01:11:07.030 --> 01:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
okay stop we'll go you know see if we
 
01:11:08.149 --> 01:11:08.159 align:start position:0%
can get a hold of parents and tell them
 
01:11:10.669 --> 01:11:10.679 align:start position:0%
we have to do that that that just seems
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know misplaced it seems like it
 
01:11:13.790 --> 01:11:13.800 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be in there because I'm not
 
01:11:15.910 --> 01:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
sure who would have time to do that
 
01:11:17.870 --> 01:11:17.880 align:start position:0%
prior to the use of and if it would stop
 
01:11:20.430 --> 01:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
any kind of intervention thinking that
 
01:11:22.350 --> 01:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
they should maybe try to get a hold of
 
01:11:24.030 --> 01:11:24.040 align:start position:0%
the parents to see if they can cord
 
01:11:26.550 --> 01:11:26.560 align:start position:0%
before that you're thank you
 
01:11:27.790 --> 01:11:27.800 align:start position:0%
representative Greg you're right that
 
01:11:30.229 --> 01:11:30.239 align:start position:0%
would be ridiculous if it didn't say in
 
01:11:33.390 --> 01:11:33.400 align:start position:0%
the same sentence just prior to that
 
01:11:35.870 --> 01:11:35.880 align:start position:0%
unless prohibited by Court shall make
 
01:11:38.629 --> 01:11:38.639 align:start position:0%
reasonable efforts to verbally notify so
 
01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:41.679 align:start position:0%
that's the guardrail there
 
01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:45.080 align:start position:0%
okay representative Nelson thank you Mr
 
01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:48.080 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking my
 
01:11:52.550 --> 01:11:52.560 align:start position:0%
question I'm wondering
 
01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:54.790 align:start position:0%
question I'm wondering
um

01:11:54.790 --> 01:11:54.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:02.070 --> 01:12:02.080 align:start position:0%
what um what is your idea of um
 
01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:05.080 align:start position:0%
including students without ni AP because
 
01:12:07.430 --> 01:12:07.440 align:start position:0%
it could be a oneoff incident where
 
01:12:11.070 --> 01:12:11.080 align:start position:0%
somebody is restrained um maybe they the
 
01:12:13.229 --> 01:12:13.239 align:start position:0%
parents choose not to have an i AP but
 
01:12:17.950 --> 01:12:17.960 align:start position:0%
they have behavioral uh issues and um
 
01:12:20.070 --> 01:12:20.080 align:start position:0%
this is not addressed in your bill so
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
what would be the protection for that
 
01:12:24.950 --> 01:12:24.960 align:start position:0%
particular student student thank you
 
01:12:26.470 --> 01:12:26.480 align:start position:0%
representative Nelson for that question
 
01:12:27.750 --> 01:12:27.760 align:start position:0%
it's an excellent point you're right
 
01:12:30.350 --> 01:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
it's not included in there um this was
 
01:12:32.550 --> 01:12:32.560 align:start position:0%
baby steps in a first first step follow
 
01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:34.760 align:start position:0%
on to the restraint seclusion bills from
 
01:12:39.350 --> 01:12:39.360 align:start position:0%
last year um I I like the idea I hope
 
01:12:42.910 --> 01:12:42.920 align:start position:0%
that it doesn't happen to I'm told and I
 
01:12:44.470 --> 01:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
my understanding from research is that
 
01:12:47.510 --> 01:12:47.520 align:start position:0%
it doesn't happen nearly as often for
 
01:12:50.870 --> 01:12:50.880 align:start position:0%
students without an IEP um sometimes on
 
01:12:53.590 --> 01:12:53.600 align:start position:0%
the road to an IEP that's that those
 
01:12:57.709 --> 01:12:57.719 align:start position:0%
things could happen so I I like the idea
 
01:13:01.669 --> 01:13:01.679 align:start position:0%
um and if the child the non child we in
 
01:13:04.390 --> 01:13:04.400 align:start position:0%
a seclusion room I think it's even more
 
01:13:06.750 --> 01:13:06.760 align:start position:0%
more important uh since you know it's
 
01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:09.800 align:start position:0%
almost there's less history in terms of
 
01:13:11.790 --> 01:13:11.800 align:start position:0%
this it's even less predictable what's
 
01:13:14.030 --> 01:13:14.040 align:start position:0%
going to happen so so the the bill
 
01:13:17.629 --> 01:13:17.639 align:start position:0%
doesn't specifically address non-ip
 
01:13:21.310 --> 01:13:21.320 align:start position:0%
child thank you representative
 
01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:23.719 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman Pearson thank
 
01:13:25.870 --> 01:13:25.880 align:start position:0%
you for being here and take my question
 
01:13:28.110 --> 01:13:28.120 align:start position:0%
um in special education I um was an
 
01:13:29.790 --> 01:13:29.800 align:start position:0%
emotional behavioral specialist for 12
 
01:13:31.830 --> 01:13:31.840 align:start position:0%
years in the middle school and the most
 
01:13:34.270 --> 01:13:34.280 align:start position:0%
important aspect in I felt in my job was
 
01:13:36.590 --> 01:13:36.600 align:start position:0%
always protect the Dignity of the child
 
01:13:40.350 --> 01:13:40.360 align:start position:0%
um and I will admit that um way back in
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
the years we've had to do restraining of
 
01:13:45.030 --> 01:13:45.040 align:start position:0%
children um in order to keep them from
 
01:13:49.030 --> 01:13:49.040 align:start position:0%
hurting themselves typically um if a
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
child got upset in a classroom we
 
01:13:52.430 --> 01:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
emptied the classroom and then we let
 
01:13:55.110 --> 01:13:55.120 align:start position:0%
the child stay there till they cool down
 
01:13:57.189 --> 01:13:57.199 align:start position:0%
um but my question and what really
 
01:13:59.790 --> 01:13:59.800 align:start position:0%
perked up my ears was your difficulty in
 
01:14:02.550 --> 01:14:02.560 align:start position:0%
getting the data and I'm just curious
 
01:14:05.110 --> 01:14:05.120 align:start position:0%
because I know that with my students
 
01:14:06.750 --> 01:14:06.760 align:start position:0%
every time there was an out of school
 
01:14:09.510 --> 01:14:09.520 align:start position:0%
placement I had to file that with in the
 
01:14:10.910 --> 01:14:10.920 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as part of the
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
IEP data collection um do they collect
 
01:14:17.149 --> 01:14:17.159 align:start position:0%
when a child is taken out of a classroom
 
01:14:19.910 --> 01:14:19.920 align:start position:0%
like most of my children that teachers
 
01:14:21.910 --> 01:14:21.920 align:start position:0%
would call me and they could come to my
 
01:14:23.669 --> 01:14:23.679 align:start position:0%
class to cool down do their work or
 
01:14:27.030 --> 01:14:27.040 align:start position:0%
whatever but um I never had to report
 
01:14:29.270 --> 01:14:29.280 align:start position:0%
every time they were taken removed from
 
01:14:31.430 --> 01:14:31.440 align:start position:0%
their um environment from that
 
01:14:33.790 --> 01:14:33.800 align:start position:0%
environment and I didn't have to report
 
01:14:35.790 --> 01:14:35.800 align:start position:0%
if they had to um stay with me for a
 
01:14:37.390 --> 01:14:37.400 align:start position:0%
certain amount of time or for how long
 
01:14:39.669 --> 01:14:39.679 align:start position:0%
that time was is there anything now
 
01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
that's requiring that data to be
 
01:14:43.990 --> 01:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
collected and is that if not is it
 
01:14:45.590 --> 01:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
something that should be put in here
 
01:14:47.830 --> 01:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
where we're paying a little more um
 
01:14:50.030 --> 01:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
closer attention to how often is the
 
01:14:51.390 --> 01:14:51.400 align:start position:0%
child removed from their general
 
01:14:54.270 --> 01:14:54.280 align:start position:0%
education um environment so thank you
 
01:14:55.709 --> 01:14:55.719 align:start position:0%
representative ball for that question If
 
01:14:58.830 --> 01:14:58.840 align:start position:0%
by removed you mean restrained we do
 
01:15:00.790 --> 01:15:00.800 align:start position:0%
have a standardized as of last year
 
01:15:04.470 --> 01:15:04.480 align:start position:0%
standardized form um that that the
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
districts have implemented our districts
 
01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:08.440 align:start position:0%
implemented it the doe sent it out the
 
01:15:10.189 --> 01:15:10.199 align:start position:0%
doe sent out specifically a technical
 
01:15:13.110 --> 01:15:13.120 align:start position:0%
bulletin with the form attached uh after
 
01:15:16.669 --> 01:15:16.679 align:start position:0%
the legislation was was passed um and I
 
01:15:18.550 --> 01:15:18.560 align:start position:0%
will also say this I'm going to give you
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
kind of a half answer because there are
 
01:15:23.550 --> 01:15:23.560 align:start position:0%
a number of experts behind me who know
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
every form the doe publishes and I do
 
01:15:28.510 --> 01:15:28.520 align:start position:0%
not um but I do know that one because I
 
01:15:29.950 --> 01:15:29.960 align:start position:0%
saw the technical bulletin and I've seen
 
01:15:32.350 --> 01:15:32.360 align:start position:0%
it implemented in our own District
 
01:15:34.830 --> 01:15:34.840 align:start position:0%
follow up please follow up so perhaps
 
01:15:37.070 --> 01:15:37.080 align:start position:0%
because I have been out of the school
 
01:15:38.590 --> 01:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
district and so that's why I'm asking
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
this question so now if I was in I had
 
01:15:43.709 --> 01:15:43.719 align:start position:0%
my own classroom um where children can
 
01:15:45.910 --> 01:15:45.920 align:start position:0%
come had chairs it was kind of a cool
 
01:15:48.110 --> 01:15:48.120 align:start position:0%
down place it was not locked I stayed in
 
01:15:50.229 --> 01:15:50.239 align:start position:0%
it all the time are you saying now if
 
01:15:51.870 --> 01:15:51.880 align:start position:0%
that child was in the classroom and said
 
01:15:53.750 --> 01:15:53.760 align:start position:0%
to their teacher I'm I'm going to lose
 
01:15:55.669 --> 01:15:55.679 align:start position:0%
it that the teacher would send them to
 
01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:57.480 align:start position:0%
my room that that would now be be
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
considered restraint rather than an
 
01:16:01.629 --> 01:16:01.639 align:start position:0%
alternative placement um well the
 
01:16:04.629 --> 01:16:04.639 align:start position:0%
definition of restraint is is in statute
 
01:16:06.669 --> 01:16:06.679 align:start position:0%
so if that fits it which I don't have it
 
01:16:08.550 --> 01:16:08.560 align:start position:0%
in front of me here and I'm not sure it
 
01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:12.360 align:start position:0%
does um if that fits it then yes um I'll
 
01:16:13.870 --> 01:16:13.880 align:start position:0%
clarify a little bit on the form so
 
01:16:16.030 --> 01:16:16.040 align:start position:0%
there was a technical advisory that said
 
01:16:18.550 --> 01:16:18.560 align:start position:0%
exactly what had to be in the form and a
 
01:16:21.110 --> 01:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
sample form it is up to the district to
 
01:16:22.830 --> 01:16:22.840 align:start position:0%
specifically as I understand it and I
 
01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:24.400 align:start position:0%
could be corrected by an expert behind
 
01:16:26.870 --> 01:16:26.880 align:start position:0%
me uh it's up to the district to adopt
 
01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
their specific form the districts that I
 
01:16:31.390 --> 01:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
spoke to after they received the
 
01:16:34.310 --> 01:16:34.320 align:start position:0%
technical advisory literally cut and
 
01:16:36.350 --> 01:16:36.360 align:start position:0%
paste out of the document and put the
 
01:16:38.629 --> 01:16:38.639 align:start position:0%
words into their own form on their
 
01:16:40.270 --> 01:16:40.280 align:start position:0%
letterhead that doesn't mean that
 
01:16:42.229 --> 01:16:42.239 align:start position:0%
happened in every uh in every school
 
01:16:44.870 --> 01:16:44.880 align:start position:0%
district but I'm sure there's plentiful
 
01:16:46.669 --> 01:16:46.679 align:start position:0%
data on the implementation of the
 
01:16:48.149 --> 01:16:48.159 align:start position:0%
standardized restraint form and every
 
01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
other form the doe requires uh in the
 
01:16:52.750 --> 01:16:52.760 align:start position:0%
folks behind me so I'll defer to them on
 
01:16:52.760 --> 01:16:55.470 align:start position:0%
folks behind me so I'll defer to them on
that

01:16:55.470 --> 01:16:55.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:57.629 --> 01:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
01:16:59.430 --> 01:16:59.440 align:start position:0%
chairman thank
 
01:17:03.229 --> 01:17:03.239 align:start position:0%
you uh I'm trying to get a handle on
 
01:17:06.189 --> 01:17:06.199 align:start position:0%
things here um you said you did some
 
01:17:08.149 --> 01:17:08.159 align:start position:0%
research and it looks like you got a lot
 
01:17:11.110 --> 01:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
of numbers on this what about damage to
 
01:17:13.189 --> 01:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
the child how much damage is being done
 
01:17:16.149 --> 01:17:16.159 align:start position:0%
by doing restraints I guess that's where
 
01:17:16.159 --> 01:17:17.830 align:start position:0%
by doing restraints I guess that's where
I'm

01:17:17.830 --> 01:17:17.840 align:start position:0%
I'm
 
01:17:19.870 --> 01:17:19.880 align:start position:0%
at thank you representative Bickford
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
good to see you um nice uh that that's a
 
01:17:25.510 --> 01:17:25.520 align:start position:0%
a really nice point and a good question
 
01:17:29.629 --> 01:17:29.639 align:start position:0%
um I would love for there to be um more
 
01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:31.800 align:start position:0%
statistics on those forms and and to
 
01:17:33.830 --> 01:17:33.840 align:start position:0%
answer some questions like those um the
 
01:17:36.950 --> 01:17:36.960 align:start position:0%
answer is I don't know out of the 1,400
 
01:17:40.270 --> 01:17:40.280 align:start position:0%
or so cases that were brought to us uh
 
01:17:43.830 --> 01:17:43.840 align:start position:0%
and that was 2122 by the way the 20 2122
 
01:17:46.950 --> 01:17:46.960 align:start position:0%
the most recent available data from doe
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%
um I do think that the doe tabulates
 
01:17:53.229 --> 01:17:53.239 align:start position:0%
some of that um we didn't disc discuss
 
01:17:55.350 --> 01:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
it specifically in terms of damage like
 
01:17:57.990 --> 01:17:58.000 align:start position:0%
how many students in those are a unique
 
01:18:00.430 --> 01:18:00.440 align:start position:0%
students which is a very valid question
 
01:18:03.510 --> 01:18:03.520 align:start position:0%
um excuse me and how many students were
 
01:18:05.470 --> 01:18:05.480 align:start position:0%
injured injured enough to be transported
 
01:18:07.270 --> 01:18:07.280 align:start position:0%
to a hospital or needed medical contest
 
01:18:10.430 --> 01:18:10.440 align:start position:0%
I don't know uh the breakdown what I
 
01:18:14.149 --> 01:18:14.159 align:start position:0%
will revert back to is 1,434 cases of
 
01:18:15.709 --> 01:18:15.719 align:start position:0%
restraints in our schools are far too
 
01:18:18.229 --> 01:18:18.239 align:start position:0%
many and whatever we can do to reduce
 
01:18:21.070 --> 01:18:21.080 align:start position:0%
that and ease the minds of those parents
 
01:18:23.470 --> 01:18:23.480 align:start position:0%
and guardians of those kids as to what
 
01:18:25.709 --> 01:18:25.719 align:start position:0%
happened the better and I I'm hoping
 
01:18:26.950 --> 01:18:26.960 align:start position:0%
this committee will find a way to do
 
01:18:28.790 --> 01:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
that and I'm happy to work on you know
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
the language if if uh the experts here
 
01:18:35.070 --> 01:18:35.080 align:start position:0%
followup question followup um what age
 
01:18:37.910 --> 01:18:37.920 align:start position:0%
group is you are you looking at on this
 
01:18:39.470 --> 01:18:39.480 align:start position:0%
I I assume the high school would not be
 
01:18:42.270 --> 01:18:42.280 align:start position:0%
included with it I I I believe it was
 
01:18:44.310 --> 01:18:44.320 align:start position:0%
and yeah I believe that's all all
 
01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:48.320 align:start position:0%
students all 168,000 is
 
01:18:52.950 --> 01:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
students oh one followup yes yeah well I
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
just thought the cro come in in place
 
01:18:58.149 --> 01:18:58.159 align:start position:0%
there uh when there's acting up in a
 
01:19:02.030 --> 01:19:02.040 align:start position:0%
high school even middle schools the you
 
01:19:04.990 --> 01:19:05.000 align:start position:0%
mean if they're over 18 or no even even
 
01:19:07.070 --> 01:19:07.080 align:start position:0%
juveniles you know the uh the school uh
 
01:19:08.950 --> 01:19:08.960 align:start position:0%
resource officer which is a policeman
 
01:19:10.270 --> 01:19:10.280 align:start position:0%
correct they're they're often on that
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
team if there's a resource officer in in
 
01:19:14.910 --> 01:19:14.920 align:start position:0%
the school I assure you yeah that that
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
trained resource officer is one of the
 
01:19:22.070 --> 01:19:22.080 align:start position:0%
five you know ideally five Personnel
 
01:19:23.510 --> 01:19:23.520 align:start position:0%
that are part of that trained process
 
01:19:24.870 --> 01:19:24.880 align:start position:0%
they most certainly are but not every as
 
01:19:26.550 --> 01:19:26.560 align:start position:0%
you as everyone here already knows
 
01:19:28.270 --> 01:19:28.280 align:start position:0%
school resource officers there aren't
 
01:19:29.550 --> 01:19:29.560 align:start position:0%
enough of them and they're not at every
 
01:19:30.590 --> 01:19:30.600 align:start position:0%
school and they're not always there at
 
01:19:32.950 --> 01:19:32.960 align:start position:0%
the right time okay thank you
 
01:19:35.070 --> 01:19:35.080 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
01:19:39.590 --> 01:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
chairman um hi uh I'm a nurse I but I
 
01:19:41.350 --> 01:19:41.360 align:start position:0%
don't really I don't work with children
 
01:19:44.950 --> 01:19:44.960 align:start position:0%
I'm not in Pediatrics so I'm under the
 
01:19:47.430 --> 01:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
impression so correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
that you know based on my experience
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
with like having to restrain dementia
 
01:19:53.709 --> 01:19:53.719 align:start position:0%
patients and things
 
01:19:57.590 --> 01:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
um any type of restraint has a risk for
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
harm and that's that's why we even in
 
01:20:03.110 --> 01:20:03.120 align:start position:0%
the hospitals we try to minimize using
 
01:20:05.030 --> 01:20:05.040 align:start position:0%
it and use any type of measure that we
 
01:20:07.870 --> 01:20:07.880 align:start position:0%
can prior to restraints and get them out
 
01:20:12.590 --> 01:20:12.600 align:start position:0%
of restraints as soon as possible um so
 
01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:14.800 align:start position:0%
maybe you could let me know but I would
 
01:20:17.550 --> 01:20:17.560 align:start position:0%
I would imagine that the situation be
 
01:20:19.870 --> 01:20:19.880 align:start position:0%
similar so thank you representative
 
01:20:21.070 --> 01:20:21.080 align:start position:0%
Gibbs for the question it's a great
 
01:20:22.390 --> 01:20:22.400 align:start position:0%
question and you're you're certainly
 
01:20:23.830 --> 01:20:23.840 align:start position:0%
speaking my language when it comes to
 
01:20:25.470 --> 01:20:25.480 align:start position:0%
the healthcare setting which I'm more
 
01:20:28.270 --> 01:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
knowledgeable about for
 
01:20:31.870 --> 01:20:31.880 align:start position:0%
restraints um it is most certainly the
 
01:20:35.270 --> 01:20:35.280 align:start position:0%
case of Last Resort um I do question
 
01:20:38.149 --> 01:20:38.159 align:start position:0%
with the numbers as they are is it
 
01:20:41.390 --> 01:20:41.400 align:start position:0%
really but I learned in research that
 
01:20:42.910 --> 01:20:42.920 align:start position:0%
restraint I think I mentioned it for
 
01:20:45.229 --> 01:20:45.239 align:start position:0%
early on in this testimony restraint can
 
01:20:48.110 --> 01:20:48.120 align:start position:0%
be leading a child down the hallway
 
01:20:50.189 --> 01:20:50.199 align:start position:0%
where the child wants to go down hallway
 
01:20:52.350 --> 01:20:52.360 align:start position:0%
X and you lead them down hallway y now
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
they've been moved somewhere against
 
01:20:55.070 --> 01:20:55.080 align:start position:0%
their will could qualify in the
 
01:20:57.830 --> 01:20:57.840 align:start position:0%
definition of restraint I'm told uh and
 
01:20:59.390 --> 01:20:59.400 align:start position:0%
I'm not a you know education law
 
01:21:01.390 --> 01:21:01.400 align:start position:0%
attorney but those were the examples you
 
01:21:03.350 --> 01:21:03.360 align:start position:0%
know one person on either side sort of
 
01:21:05.229 --> 01:21:05.239 align:start position:0%
gently taking them by the arm it's not
 
01:21:06.990 --> 01:21:07.000 align:start position:0%
the type of violent restraint four point
 
01:21:08.830 --> 01:21:08.840 align:start position:0%
soft restraints hard restraints chemical
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
restraints that you and I may be
 
01:21:12.510 --> 01:21:12.520 align:start position:0%
accustomed to in healthcare it's far far
 
01:21:14.750 --> 01:21:14.760 align:start position:0%
from that and I think usually it is far
 
01:21:16.990 --> 01:21:17.000 align:start position:0%
from that right that that's my
 
01:21:21.229 --> 01:21:21.239 align:start position:0%
impression yeah um follow up follow up
 
01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
uh I would not I I am surprised to learn
 
01:21:26.950 --> 01:21:26.960 align:start position:0%
that leading someone down a hall would
 
01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:29.120 align:start position:0%
be considered or restraint because in
 
01:21:32.910 --> 01:21:32.920 align:start position:0%
the elderly the geriatric po uh
 
01:21:34.910 --> 01:21:34.920 align:start position:0%
population that's not considered a
 
01:21:36.470 --> 01:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
restraint as long as they can move
 
01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:38.480 align:start position:0%
freely and so if you're just guiding
 
01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:40.280 align:start position:0%
them because you know if someone's using
 
01:21:42.270 --> 01:21:42.280 align:start position:0%
a walker they they could run into a wall
 
01:21:44.470 --> 01:21:44.480 align:start position:0%
or something you're you you guide them
 
01:21:46.870 --> 01:21:46.880 align:start position:0%
so that they don't collide with foreign
 
01:21:48.669 --> 01:21:48.679 align:start position:0%
objects things like that we don't
 
01:21:50.149 --> 01:21:50.159 align:start position:0%
consider that a restraint in the
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
hospital what we consider a restraint is
 
01:21:56.629 --> 01:21:56.639 align:start position:0%
any any method that where they can't
 
01:22:00.030 --> 01:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
freely move and sometimes that is from
 
01:22:02.110 --> 01:22:02.120 align:start position:0%
my experience sometimes that is things
 
01:22:03.910 --> 01:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
that you would have to think outside the
 
01:22:07.990 --> 01:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
box for like I've seen um lnas use move
 
01:22:09.750 --> 01:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
to a
 
01:22:12.590 --> 01:22:12.600 align:start position:0%
question use trash cans underneath like
 
01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:15.880 align:start position:0%
a recliner to elevate their legs but
 
01:22:17.910 --> 01:22:17.920 align:start position:0%
then they can't put their leg their legs
 
01:22:20.750 --> 01:22:20.760 align:start position:0%
down clever so wouldn't you believe
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you believe that that would be
 
01:22:22.159 --> 01:22:23.510 align:start position:0%
wouldn't you believe that that would be
a

01:22:23.510 --> 01:22:23.520 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:22:25.910 --> 01:22:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question so so in I
 
01:22:27.189 --> 01:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
don't think that we encounter that in
 
01:22:28.870 --> 01:22:28.880 align:start position:0%
the context of of an educational
 
01:22:30.229 --> 01:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
institution I don't think that
 
01:22:33.750 --> 01:22:33.760 align:start position:0%
particular type um so I think you bring
 
01:22:36.510 --> 01:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
up a very fair and valid point that is
 
01:22:41.110 --> 01:22:41.120 align:start position:0%
there a case of not over reporting but
 
01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:44.760 align:start position:0%
reporting you know the administrators
 
01:22:47.070 --> 01:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
and Educators would rather fill out the
 
01:22:50.149 --> 01:22:50.159 align:start position:0%
form and report it for as much
 
01:22:53.870 --> 01:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
transparency as possible um than not so
 
01:22:56.310 --> 01:22:56.320 align:start position:0%
they error on the side of over reporting
 
01:22:57.990 --> 01:22:58.000 align:start position:0%
if I could I don't know if that's really
 
01:22:59.830 --> 01:22:59.840 align:start position:0%
the right term I don't want to
 
01:23:03.470 --> 01:23:03.480 align:start position:0%
mischaracterize it um and I mean I what
 
01:23:06.430 --> 01:23:06.440 align:start position:0%
led me to that thinking was talking with
 
01:23:07.910 --> 01:23:07.920 align:start position:0%
our own District when they said well
 
01:23:10.390 --> 01:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
we've got 49 cases so far I said what do
 
01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:13.320 align:start position:0%
you mean it's like we're a month in and
 
01:23:14.950 --> 01:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
that was the answer they said that you
 
01:23:17.390 --> 01:23:17.400 align:start position:0%
know we report everything we write down
 
01:23:18.870 --> 01:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
everything and I'm not sure the standard
 
01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:21.880 align:start position:0%
is the same across every every school um
 
01:23:23.430 --> 01:23:23.440 align:start position:0%
again I will the first sum of that
 
01:23:24.629 --> 01:23:24.639 align:start position:0%
please bring that up again with the
 
01:23:26.990 --> 01:23:27.000 align:start position:0%
experts behind me who work across many
 
01:23:28.790 --> 01:23:28.800 align:start position:0%
schools good pair of professionals work
 
01:23:30.790 --> 01:23:30.800 align:start position:0%
with clients so there's a lot of
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
different stories and and I don't know
 
01:23:34.910 --> 01:23:34.920 align:start position:0%
what they all what they all will be so
 
01:23:37.070 --> 01:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
um but I know some of them so I think
 
01:23:39.270 --> 01:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
you'll get some good information from
 
01:23:41.830 --> 01:23:41.840 align:start position:0%
them seeing no further questions thank
 
01:23:43.550 --> 01:23:43.560 align:start position:0%
you so much for your testimony and
 
01:23:45.510 --> 01:23:45.520 align:start position:0%

once and he couldn't tell his daddy what
 
01:24:35.189 --> 01:24:35.199 align:start position:0%
happened because he he can't talk and

PBIS coordinator where I built systems
 
01:25:56.350 --> 01:25:56.360 align:start position:0%
for schools such as lonier for the whole
 
01:25:58.669 --> 01:25:58.679 align:start position:0%
District where I worked on building in
 
01:26:02.629 --> 01:26:02.639 align:start position:0%
proactive systems to reduce um to reduce
 
01:26:04.830 --> 01:26:04.840 align:start position:0%
restraint and seclusion as well as
 
01:26:07.109 --> 01:26:07.119 align:start position:0%
Behavior the reason why I come to you
 
01:26:11.109 --> 01:26:11.119 align:start position:0%
today is because um since covid I have
 
01:26:13.669 --> 01:26:13.679 align:start position:0%
seen an increase in the amount of
 
01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:15.960 align:start position:0%
families reaching out with children who
 
01:26:17.709 --> 01:26:17.719 align:start position:0%
have injuries in
 
01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:20.760 align:start position:0%
school where restraints and I I gave a
 
01:26:22.270 --> 01:26:22.280 align:start position:0%
big pamphlet to you I'm not going to go
 
01:26:23.910 --> 01:26:23.920 align:start position:0%
through it the whole thing but there's
 
01:26:25.270 --> 01:26:25.280 align:start position:0%
many of the questions that you have
 
01:26:28.590 --> 01:26:28.600 align:start position:0%
already asked um are answered in this
 
01:26:30.350 --> 01:26:30.360 align:start position:0%
and feel free to contact me after if you
 
01:26:33.149 --> 01:26:33.159 align:start position:0%
have any more questions um
 
01:26:36.149 --> 01:26:36.159 align:start position:0%
however kids are not being restrained in
 
01:26:38.350 --> 01:26:38.360 align:start position:0%
places like the lunchroom in the
 
01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:42.440 align:start position:0%
classroom in the hallway for the most
 
01:26:44.270 --> 01:26:44.280 align:start position:0%
part kids who are being restrained are
 
01:26:46.030 --> 01:26:46.040 align:start position:0%
being restrained in segregated
 
01:26:50.109 --> 01:26:50.119 align:start position:0%
classrooms where there is already a um a
 
01:26:52.629 --> 01:26:52.639 align:start position:0%
a place for them to go in some used to
 
01:26:55.189 --> 01:26:55.199 align:start position:0%
close the doors some now put up barriers
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
but it's a place to make a child go in
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
um if you see on the next page right
 
01:27:03.030 --> 01:27:03.040 align:start position:0%
here uh I hope you have more you said on
 
01:27:05.870 --> 01:27:05.880 align:start position:0%
your card you had 15 copies we only got
 
01:27:11.109 --> 01:27:11.119 align:start position:0%
seven oh so if there's any more uh you
 
01:27:14.870 --> 01:27:14.880 align:start position:0%
got yours okay we ran out I see I
 
01:27:17.990 --> 01:27:18.000 align:start position:0%
apologize you have them we're too short
 
01:27:21.030 --> 01:27:21.040 align:start position:0%
but okay I did give them to the audience
 
01:27:22.629 --> 01:27:22.639 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll make sure to get them emailed
 
01:27:24.669 --> 01:27:24.679 align:start position:0%
them to us I did email them to you as
 
01:27:26.510 --> 01:27:26.520 align:start position:0%
well okay thank you that doesn't count
 
01:27:29.149 --> 01:27:29.159 align:start position:0%
towards your three minutes
 
01:27:31.669 --> 01:27:31.679 align:start position:0%
welcome these rooms are in a lot of our
 
01:27:33.990 --> 01:27:34.000 align:start position:0%
elementary schools somebody asked the
 
01:27:36.990 --> 01:27:37.000 align:start position:0%
question on what about high school at
 
01:27:38.470 --> 01:27:38.480 align:start position:0%
the middle and high school you don't
 
01:27:40.950 --> 01:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
typically see students restrained you
 
01:27:43.390 --> 01:27:43.400 align:start position:0%
see people use different techniques to
 
01:27:46.470 --> 01:27:46.480 align:start position:0%
re to reduce the behavior Elementary
 
01:27:48.550 --> 01:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
School is where the most restraints and
 
01:27:50.629 --> 01:27:50.639 align:start position:0%
seclusion happens and the most is
 
01:27:53.709 --> 01:27:53.719 align:start position:0%
between the ages of 7 and 10 years old
 
01:27:55.430 --> 01:27:55.440 align:start position:0%
where they are put into a room if you
 
01:27:57.390 --> 01:27:57.400 align:start position:0%
can imagine if you were put into a room
 
01:28:00.030 --> 01:28:00.040 align:start position:0%
like this you may start to fight and
 
01:28:02.109 --> 01:28:02.119 align:start position:0%
then you may end up being restrained
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
because you didn't want to go into this
 
01:28:08.229 --> 01:28:08.239 align:start position:0%
room most kids have um I'm going to skip
 
01:28:11.750 --> 01:28:11.760 align:start position:0%
forward most students have um
 
01:28:14.430 --> 01:28:14.440 align:start position:0%
disabilities 80% of students that are
 
01:28:17.709 --> 01:28:17.719 align:start position:0%
restrained and secluded in schools uh
 
01:28:19.510 --> 01:28:19.520 align:start position:0%
have disabilities there was a question
 
01:28:21.550 --> 01:28:21.560 align:start position:0%
about what about if a student doesn't
 
01:28:23.910 --> 01:28:23.920 align:start position:0%
have enough IEP and they do have a
 
01:28:25.950 --> 01:28:25.960 align:start position:0%
behavior problem you could also look to
 
01:28:29.350 --> 01:28:29.360 align:start position:0%
a 504 and make it an accommodation for
 
01:28:33.870 --> 01:28:33.880 align:start position:0%
that um my biggest concern is monitoring
 
01:28:37.350 --> 01:28:37.360 align:start position:0%
over oversight for children lots and
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
lots of families come to me and they are
 
01:28:41.750 --> 01:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
in tears they have reached out
 
01:28:44.830 --> 01:28:44.840 align:start position:0%
everywhere I have experienced this I now
 
01:28:47.149 --> 01:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
have a three-year-old grandson who has a
 
01:28:50.310 --> 01:28:50.320 align:start position:0%
speech delay who got on the bus and we
 
01:28:52.109 --> 01:28:52.119 align:start position:0%
don't know what's happening there right
 
01:28:54.669 --> 01:28:54.679 align:start position:0%
right there are cameras everywhere in
 
01:28:58.470 --> 01:28:58.480 align:start position:0%
our in our society absolutely everywhere
 
01:29:01.669 --> 01:29:01.679 align:start position:0%
kids come home bruised they come home
 
01:29:05.030 --> 01:29:05.040 align:start position:0%
with rug Burns they come home with
 
01:29:09.030 --> 01:29:09.040 align:start position:0%
concussions they come home with um notes
 
01:29:11.470 --> 01:29:11.480 align:start position:0%
saying that they spent 2 hours in a
 
01:29:14.550 --> 01:29:14.560 align:start position:0%
seclusion room and nobody knows what
 
01:29:17.189 --> 01:29:17.199 align:start position:0%
happens half a minute as far as
 
01:29:20.550 --> 01:29:20.560 align:start position:0%
documentation documentation is very very
 
01:29:23.350 --> 01:29:23.360 align:start position:0%
difficult um because I can tell you even
 
01:29:25.189 --> 01:29:25.199 align:start position:0%
the numbers that are there are not the
 
01:29:29.070 --> 01:29:29.080 align:start position:0%
correct numbers my goal is that children
 
01:29:32.390 --> 01:29:32.400 align:start position:0%
who don't have a voice have an extra set
 
01:29:36.390 --> 01:29:36.400 align:start position:0%
of eyes which would be a camera to um to
 
01:29:39.350 --> 01:29:39.360 align:start position:0%
actually help the parents and the staff
 
01:29:41.550 --> 01:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
see what is need to be done thank you
 
01:29:43.870 --> 01:29:43.880 align:start position:0%
very much would you take questions will
 
01:29:45.830 --> 01:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
if there are any
 
01:29:48.430 --> 01:29:48.440 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:29:52.470 --> 01:29:52.480 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman Pearson um as
 
01:29:53.950 --> 01:29:53.960 align:start position:0%
you've mentioned you saw the thank you
 
01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:55.800 align:start position:0%
for taking my question I'm sorry thank
 
01:29:57.790 --> 01:29:57.800 align:start position:0%
you um you mentioned that you saw a lot
 
01:29:59.229 --> 01:29:59.239 align:start position:0%
of these things in the school and we've
 
01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
heard others say that some of the school
 
01:30:03.870 --> 01:30:03.880 align:start position:0%
districts are now creating their own
 
01:30:06.590 --> 01:30:06.600 align:start position:0%
programs within a school in order not to
 
01:30:09.229 --> 01:30:09.239 align:start position:0%
outplay the children do you do you agree
 
01:30:12.629 --> 01:30:12.639 align:start position:0%
or disagree with um keeping the children
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
in a public school as opposed to putting
 
01:30:16.270 --> 01:30:16.280 align:start position:0%
them into a private outter school
 
01:30:18.070 --> 01:30:18.080 align:start position:0%
placement for the children who are
 
01:30:21.270 --> 01:30:21.280 align:start position:0%
really constantly being needing to be
 
01:30:22.870 --> 01:30:22.880 align:start position:0%
going into
 
01:30:25.109 --> 01:30:25.119 align:start position:0%
as someone who is 4 fo8 and has worked
 
01:30:27.550 --> 01:30:27.560 align:start position:0%
with the most difficult behavioral
 
01:30:30.229 --> 01:30:30.239 align:start position:0%
students including High School in the
 
01:30:32.669 --> 01:30:32.679 align:start position:0%
state I never been hit kicked bit spit
 
01:30:35.310 --> 01:30:35.320 align:start position:0%
at it is about technique and training as
 
01:30:36.790 --> 01:30:36.800 align:start position:0%
somebody who taught at the University
 
01:30:40.350 --> 01:30:40.360 align:start position:0%
level we do not teach that we do not
 
01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:42.480 align:start position:0%
teach how to escalate we maybe we do it
 
01:30:45.590 --> 01:30:45.600 align:start position:0%
once a year maybe it's like CPR we we
 
01:30:48.750 --> 01:30:48.760 align:start position:0%
not we don't become experts in CPR right
 
01:30:50.350 --> 01:30:50.360 align:start position:0%
I do think there's a there's so many
 
01:30:51.510 --> 01:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
things we could do there could be
 
01:30:54.270 --> 01:30:54.280 align:start position:0%
training training there could be um
 
01:30:56.750 --> 01:30:56.760 align:start position:0%
systems there needs to be support there
 
01:30:59.430 --> 01:30:59.440 align:start position:0%
there's so much we could do but in my
 
01:31:02.430 --> 01:31:02.440 align:start position:0%
eyes right now I don't want anybody else
 
01:31:04.229 --> 01:31:04.239 align:start position:0%
coming home hurt and I don't want to get
 
01:31:06.590 --> 01:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
another phone call from another parent
 
01:31:08.990 --> 01:31:09.000 align:start position:0%
saying this happened to my kid and I
 
01:31:11.390 --> 01:31:11.400 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened
 
01:31:11.400 --> 01:31:13.310 align:start position:0%
don't know what happened
representative

01:31:13.310 --> 01:31:13.320 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:15.510 --> 01:31:15.520 align:start position:0%
Petrino thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:31:17.790 --> 01:31:17.800 align:start position:0%
you so much for taking my question so
 
01:31:19.870 --> 01:31:19.880 align:start position:0%
we've already uh acknowledged that there
 
01:31:22.629 --> 01:31:22.639 align:start position:0%
are video cameras just about every
 
01:31:26.189 --> 01:31:26.199 align:start position:0%
and I think uh representative Molton uh
 
01:31:27.950 --> 01:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
mentioning her experience as a nurse
 
01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
that you know when there is restraint um
 
01:31:33.229 --> 01:31:33.239 align:start position:0%
there is occasionally harm that happens
 
01:31:35.149 --> 01:31:35.159 align:start position:0%
and I'm not looking to minimize at all
 
01:31:38.149 --> 01:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
because it is serious but is there an
 
01:31:40.430 --> 01:31:40.440 align:start position:0%
implication that educational
 
01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:43.480 align:start position:0%
professionals are abusing children
 
01:31:47.910 --> 01:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
that's really the Crux of it I would say
 
01:31:51.270 --> 01:31:51.280 align:start position:0%
that um staff go into their own fight or
 
01:31:53.950 --> 01:31:53.960 align:start position:0%
flight mode because they have typically
 
01:31:56.229 --> 01:31:56.239 align:start position:0%
who do we have working with our most
 
01:31:58.910 --> 01:31:58.920 align:start position:0%
challenging students our paraeducators
 
01:32:01.830 --> 01:32:01.840 align:start position:0%
who have not been taught on how to
 
01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:04.360 align:start position:0%
deescalate and that's where the kind of
 
01:32:07.030 --> 01:32:07.040 align:start position:0%
the problem comes from in Canada they
 
01:32:09.109 --> 01:32:09.119 align:start position:0%
have the special education teachers
 
01:32:10.790 --> 01:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
working with the kids and the par
 
01:32:13.390 --> 01:32:13.400 align:start position:0%
Educators doing the paperwork we have
 
01:32:16.390 --> 01:32:16.400 align:start position:0%
that opposite here in our country any
 
01:32:16.400 --> 01:32:17.750 align:start position:0%
that opposite here in our country any
further

01:32:17.750 --> 01:32:17.760 align:start position:0%
further
 
01:32:20.229 --> 01:32:20.239 align:start position:0%
questions representative
 
01:32:22.950 --> 01:32:22.960 align:start position:0%
long uh thank you Mr chairman uh and
 
01:32:26.189 --> 01:32:26.199 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my questions um so
 
01:32:30.830 --> 01:32:30.840 align:start position:0%
so the uh have you been able to observe
 
01:32:34.629 --> 01:32:34.639 align:start position:0%
video of these seclusion rooms I I have
 
01:32:38.109 --> 01:32:38.119 align:start position:0%
been in seclusion rooms I have witnessed
 
01:32:40.229 --> 01:32:40.239 align:start position:0%
restraints uh I've been in education for
 
01:32:42.709 --> 01:32:42.719 align:start position:0%
25 years I've been at a consultant with
 
01:32:46.189 --> 01:32:46.199 align:start position:0%
UNH for8 where I worked in lots of um
 
01:32:48.990 --> 01:32:49.000 align:start position:0%
Elementary to high school so I have seen
 
01:32:51.430 --> 01:32:51.440 align:start position:0%
I have witnessed it a lot okay follow
 
01:32:51.440 --> 01:32:52.149 align:start position:0%
I have witnessed it a lot okay follow
off

01:32:52.149 --> 01:32:52.159 align:start position:0%
off
 
01:32:54.270 --> 01:32:54.280 align:start position:0%
so so no you haven't seen the videos I'm
 
01:32:56.430 --> 01:32:56.440 align:start position:0%
wondering if these videos
 
01:32:59.910 --> 01:32:59.920 align:start position:0%
help I wonder if these videos Sor I
 
01:33:02.950 --> 01:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
misunderstood your question or or uh
 
01:33:05.430 --> 01:33:05.440 align:start position:0%
would uh deescalation training for par
 
01:33:07.550 --> 01:33:07.560 align:start position:0%
professionals be more effective that's a
 
01:33:10.149 --> 01:33:10.159 align:start position:0%
great question um I think automatically
 
01:33:12.470 --> 01:33:12.480 align:start position:0%
when we are on camera we automatically
 
01:33:15.310 --> 01:33:15.320 align:start position:0%
change our behavior um I just actually
 
01:33:17.510 --> 01:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
had a case that went through due process
 
01:33:19.790 --> 01:33:19.800 align:start position:0%
which we were lucky to have uh it
 
01:33:23.390 --> 01:33:23.400 align:start position:0%
happened in a vesu the the student had
 
01:33:26.790 --> 01:33:26.800 align:start position:0%
had had his whole day was spent there um
 
01:33:29.590 --> 01:33:29.600 align:start position:0%
and we were able there was a report that
 
01:33:31.629 --> 01:33:31.639 align:start position:0%
was written that looked like this child
 
01:33:33.950 --> 01:33:33.960 align:start position:0%
should be locked up in conquered State
 
01:33:37.510 --> 01:33:37.520 align:start position:0%
Prison it was so badly written and about
 
01:33:39.950 --> 01:33:39.960 align:start position:0%
the child's Behavior we happened to find
 
01:33:43.030 --> 01:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
a video on it and it did not match at
 
01:33:45.709 --> 01:33:45.719 align:start position:0%
all what happened so I think
 
01:33:47.950 --> 01:33:47.960 align:start position:0%
automatically we change our behavior
 
01:33:50.030 --> 01:33:50.040 align:start position:0%
when we know we're being filmed that's
 
01:33:51.870 --> 01:33:51.880 align:start position:0%
why restraints and seclusions are not
 
01:33:54.030 --> 01:33:54.040 align:start position:0%
happening in classrooms where kids can
 
01:33:56.510 --> 01:33:56.520 align:start position:0%
go home and say what happened that's why
 
01:33:58.750 --> 01:33:58.760 align:start position:0%
they're happening in these rooms okay
 
01:34:01.510 --> 01:34:01.520 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you representative ball
 
01:34:03.189 --> 01:34:03.199 align:start position:0%
thank you chairman Pearson and thank you
 
01:34:04.790 --> 01:34:04.800 align:start position:0%
again for taking another question I'm
 
01:34:06.790 --> 01:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
just curious because you made the um
 
01:34:09.750 --> 01:34:09.760 align:start position:0%
statement about um it typically is a
 
01:34:12.070 --> 01:34:12.080 align:start position:0%
parah that is out in the classrooms with
 
01:34:14.910 --> 01:34:14.920 align:start position:0%
these children um when I did that as a
 
01:34:17.510 --> 01:34:17.520 align:start position:0%
teacher my pars all had their cell
 
01:34:19.550 --> 01:34:19.560 align:start position:0%
phones with me and I had my cell phone
 
01:34:21.709 --> 01:34:21.719 align:start position:0%
with me so because I was actually
 
01:34:24.189 --> 01:34:24.199 align:start position:0%
teaching in a classroom at the same time
 
01:34:27.310 --> 01:34:27.320 align:start position:0%
um but they would we had a code you know
 
01:34:29.550 --> 01:34:29.560 align:start position:0%
a green yellow red so that they could
 
01:34:31.870 --> 01:34:31.880 align:start position:0%
tell me when I would check up and I did
 
01:34:33.430 --> 01:34:33.440 align:start position:0%
check up on all my students that were
 
01:34:34.830 --> 01:34:34.840 align:start position:0%
out in the janed classroom and they
 
01:34:36.870 --> 01:34:36.880 align:start position:0%
could say no he's in greened sometimes
 
01:34:39.189 --> 01:34:39.199 align:start position:0%
he'd say he's in yellow and I'd be like
 
01:34:41.910 --> 01:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
let me know keep me and they might say
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
he's in yellow but you need to come so I
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
would be there before he hit the red was
 
01:34:48.070 --> 01:34:48.080 align:start position:0%
there any kind of a system in the
 
01:34:49.910 --> 01:34:49.920 align:start position:0%
schools that you worked with any kind of
 
01:34:51.950 --> 01:34:51.960 align:start position:0%
direct communication so that the special
 
01:34:54.950 --> 01:34:54.960 align:start position:0%
educator who is trained and that is
 
01:34:57.990 --> 01:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
their area of expertise that you had an
 
01:35:01.270 --> 01:35:01.280 align:start position:0%
immediate call to get me out of my
 
01:35:04.109 --> 01:35:04.119 align:start position:0%
classroom and into your classroom um
 
01:35:06.750 --> 01:35:06.760 align:start position:0%
that's an excellent question it makes me
 
01:35:09.830 --> 01:35:09.840 align:start position:0%
think of two things one is first um
 
01:35:12.350 --> 01:35:12.360 align:start position:0%
contacting the parent because I can tell
 
01:35:14.550 --> 01:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
you I've watched it everybody is
 
01:35:16.629 --> 01:35:16.639 align:start position:0%
contacted when it when a student of
 
01:35:19.550 --> 01:35:19.560 align:start position:0%
known um escalation the principal's
 
01:35:21.510 --> 01:35:21.520 align:start position:0%
contacted the secretary's contacted
 
01:35:24.390 --> 01:35:24.400 align:start position:0%
everybody's everybody comes in right but
 
01:35:25.950 --> 01:35:25.960 align:start position:0%
we don't want to get to that point and
 
01:35:28.030 --> 01:35:28.040 align:start position:0%
what I think you're saying is an
 
01:35:30.950 --> 01:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
excellent strategy of PBIS functional
 
01:35:33.430 --> 01:35:33.440 align:start position:0%
Behavior assessments which is in the law
 
01:35:36.430 --> 01:35:36.440 align:start position:0%
um what I am finding is that you know
 
01:35:39.109 --> 01:35:39.119 align:start position:0%
after 10 days of of being in in
 
01:35:41.310 --> 01:35:41.320 align:start position:0%
suspension or out of out of the typical
 
01:35:43.270 --> 01:35:43.280 align:start position:0%
classroom um you're supposed to do a
 
01:35:44.669 --> 01:35:44.679 align:start position:0%
functional Behavior assessment to
 
01:35:46.990 --> 01:35:47.000 align:start position:0%
decrease that behavior that is not
 
01:35:48.910 --> 01:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
happening and people are not
 
01:35:50.990 --> 01:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
understanding what a functional Behavior
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
assessment is that's not being taught at
 
01:35:55.950 --> 01:35:55.960 align:start position:0%
the at the um at the at the University
 
01:35:58.990 --> 01:35:59.000 align:start position:0%
level as well follow up would you
 
01:36:00.550 --> 01:36:00.560 align:start position:0%
believe that the majority of schools in
 
01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:02.199 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do not even know that
 
01:36:03.470 --> 01:36:03.480 align:start position:0%
people that are certified as an
 
01:36:05.350 --> 01:36:05.360 align:start position:0%
emotional behavioral specialist they
 
01:36:07.510 --> 01:36:07.520 align:start position:0%
don't even realize that we are the
 
01:36:09.070 --> 01:36:09.080 align:start position:0%
people who are supposed to be doing the
 
01:36:12.430 --> 01:36:12.440 align:start position:0%
functional behavioral analysis I do
 
01:36:12.440 --> 01:36:13.109 align:start position:0%
functional behavioral analysis I do
thank

01:36:13.109 --> 01:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:36:15.430 --> 01:36:15.440 align:start position:0%
you thank you for thank you for your
 
01:36:17.470 --> 01:36:17.480 align:start position:0%
testimony thank
 
01:36:21.390 --> 01:36:21.400 align:start position:0%
you sorry representative McMahon Mr Hand
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry sir thank you Mr
 
01:36:27.669 --> 01:36:27.679 align:start position:0%
chairman Miss Tracy I assume you've read
 
01:36:30.750 --> 01:36:30.760 align:start position:0%
the bill yes I have and specific uh to
 
01:36:32.510 --> 01:36:32.520 align:start position:0%
where the existing Bill we're looking at
 
01:36:36.430 --> 01:36:36.440 align:start position:0%
um on line five where it's stating uh um
 
01:36:40.629 --> 01:36:40.639 align:start position:0%
visually and auditorily recorded if such
 
01:36:43.910 --> 01:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
method is in the
 
01:36:46.830 --> 01:36:46.840 align:start position:0%
IEP at at this point where the existing
 
01:36:49.189 --> 01:36:49.199 align:start position:0%
law is apply uh by reading the existing
 
01:36:52.590 --> 01:36:52.600 align:start position:0%
law does it apply to all as opposed to
 
01:36:54.270 --> 01:36:54.280 align:start position:0%
in this case where is would this be
 
01:36:57.790 --> 01:36:57.800 align:start position:0%
whether an IEP would preclude the use of
 
01:37:00.430 --> 01:37:00.440 align:start position:0%
uh camera and auditory
 
01:37:04.189 --> 01:37:04.199 align:start position:0%
monitoring in including no precluding
 
01:37:06.709 --> 01:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
why yeah the point is why is it saying
 
01:37:09.229 --> 01:37:09.239 align:start position:0%
if when it implies it was already in
 
01:37:11.390 --> 01:37:11.400 align:start position:0%
place by existing
 
01:37:15.390 --> 01:37:15.400 align:start position:0%
law I just see what the guidance I'm I'm
 
01:37:17.629 --> 01:37:17.639 align:start position:0%
going to let the prime sponsor address
 
01:37:20.189 --> 01:37:20.199 align:start position:0%
that come on up to the
 
01:37:20.199 --> 01:37:22.350 align:start position:0%
that come on up to the
microphone

01:37:22.350 --> 01:37:22.360 align:start position:0%
microphone
 
01:37:24.270 --> 01:37:24.280 align:start position:0%
that's a great question a a little bit
 
01:37:27.229 --> 01:37:27.239 align:start position:0%
technical but um but a great question so
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
the idea is that since you can already
 
01:37:30.480 --> 01:37:31.470 align:start position:0%
the idea is that since you can already
request

01:37:31.470 --> 01:37:31.480 align:start position:0%
request
 
01:37:35.510 --> 01:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
it in in in the IP and that's Def and
 
01:37:38.950 --> 01:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
that ability nothing shall preclude is
 
01:37:38.960 --> 01:37:40.870 align:start position:0%
that ability nothing shall preclude is
in

01:37:40.870 --> 01:37:40.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:37:44.390 --> 01:37:44.400 align:start position:0%
189 the thinking was how do we draft
 
01:37:49.149 --> 01:37:49.159 align:start position:0%
this as enabling legislation so so I see
 
01:37:53.550 --> 01:37:53.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:56.830 --> 01:37:56.840 align:start position:0%
parent with a child with an IEP gets a
 
01:38:00.669 --> 01:38:00.679 align:start position:0%
report maybe two of restraint or
 
01:38:03.950 --> 01:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
seclusion and for whatever reason they
 
01:38:05.589 --> 01:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
don't feel like they got quite enough
 
01:38:07.589 --> 01:38:07.599 align:start position:0%
information the report was not filled
 
01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:09.360 align:start position:0%
out well they didn't get it at all it
 
01:38:11.990 --> 01:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
took a month and a half to get it or for
 
01:38:13.430 --> 01:38:13.440 align:start position:0%
whatever reason they didn't get enough
 
01:38:14.430 --> 01:38:14.440 align:start position:0%
and I'm not saying those things
 
01:38:16.030 --> 01:38:16.040 align:start position:0%
necessarily happen because I I'm not I
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
don't think they do I think the
 
01:38:19.189 --> 01:38:19.199 align:start position:0%
Educators take the practice very
 
01:38:22.550 --> 01:38:22.560 align:start position:0%
seriously because it is but then they
 
01:38:25.750 --> 01:38:25.760 align:start position:0%
might say could you could you please put
 
01:38:27.070 --> 01:38:27.080 align:start position:0%
them in the room with the camera can you
 
01:38:29.270 --> 01:38:29.280 align:start position:0%
put a camera in there can somebody
 
01:38:31.510 --> 01:38:31.520 align:start position:0%
whoever is in charge of the one-on-one
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
in in seclusion right then they can
 
01:38:37.709 --> 01:38:37.719 align:start position:0%
request that as part of the IEP right
 
01:38:40.310 --> 01:38:40.320 align:start position:0%
that that's how I think this will work
 
01:38:42.790 --> 01:38:42.800 align:start position:0%
right you could a parent could with
 
01:38:44.709 --> 01:38:44.719 align:start position:0%
great forethought and I think somebody
 
01:38:46.070 --> 01:38:46.080 align:start position:0%
else pointed out and I think the office
 
01:38:47.430 --> 01:38:47.440 align:start position:0%
of the child advocate is going to point
 
01:38:48.669 --> 01:38:48.679 align:start position:0%
it out in their written testimony if
 
01:38:52.270 --> 01:38:52.280 align:start position:0%
they haven't already um that that kids
 
01:38:52.280 --> 01:38:53.189 align:start position:0%
they haven't already um that that kids
without

01:38:53.189 --> 01:38:53.199 align:start position:0%
without
 
01:38:55.910 --> 01:38:55.920 align:start position:0%
iips uh it's a little more difficult to
 
01:38:58.470 --> 01:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
implement the whole audio video thing
 
01:39:00.430 --> 01:39:00.440 align:start position:0%
and parents who didn't think of it in
 
01:39:03.189 --> 01:39:03.199 align:start position:0%
advance so it may be reactionary right
 
01:39:04.430 --> 01:39:04.440 align:start position:0%
but I think we also ought to give the
 
01:39:07.510 --> 01:39:07.520 align:start position:0%
schools a chance to do it right and you
 
01:39:08.790 --> 01:39:08.800 align:start position:0%
know report
 
01:39:11.589 --> 01:39:11.599 align:start position:0%
properly and it's it it's for the case
 
01:39:14.189 --> 01:39:14.199 align:start position:0%
where there's unanswered questions and
 
01:39:16.470 --> 01:39:16.480 align:start position:0%
this is an attempt to answer those
 
01:39:18.149 --> 01:39:18.159 align:start position:0%
questions that does that does that make
 
01:39:19.270 --> 01:39:19.280 align:start position:0%
sense that answer your question as far
 
01:39:21.109 --> 01:39:21.119 align:start position:0%
as how it's structured and what's
 
01:39:22.629 --> 01:39:22.639 align:start position:0%
statute and the
 
01:39:24.990 --> 01:39:25.000 align:start position:0%
language um follow up thank you Mr
 
01:39:27.270 --> 01:39:27.280 align:start position:0%
chairman um I'll I'll stipulate to your
 
01:39:28.470 --> 01:39:28.480 align:start position:0%
knowledge and the homework that you've
 
01:39:30.149 --> 01:39:30.159 align:start position:0%
already done mean it's it's a debating
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
point of application versus reality when
 
01:39:35.589 --> 01:39:35.599 align:start position:0%
you're on the battlefield here isn't it
 
01:39:40.350 --> 01:39:40.360 align:start position:0%
always yes and um my my point here is oh
 
01:39:42.189 --> 01:39:42.199 align:start position:0%
not my point my question to to both of
 
01:39:44.510 --> 01:39:44.520 align:start position:0%
you is can we have a homogeneous
 
01:39:46.709 --> 01:39:46.719 align:start position:0%
language that applies to all then once
 
01:39:49.270 --> 01:39:49.280 align:start position:0%
you cross the threshold of the school
 
01:39:52.990 --> 01:39:53.000 align:start position:0%
that your the rules apply to all and and
 
01:39:55.430 --> 01:39:55.440 align:start position:0%
to ensure that compliance to the intent
 
01:39:57.669 --> 01:39:57.679 align:start position:0%
here and not a subjective application
 
01:39:59.510 --> 01:39:59.520 align:start position:0%
based on opinion whether an
 
01:40:04.310 --> 01:40:04.320 align:start position:0%
I uh or not an IEP will apply for
 
01:40:07.870 --> 01:40:07.880 align:start position:0%
audiovisual um uh Records for those who
 
01:40:10.790 --> 01:40:10.800 align:start position:0%
are in the uh having a problem and are
 
01:40:13.830 --> 01:40:13.840 align:start position:0%
in a secluded room or a protected area
 
01:40:16.229 --> 01:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
you could I think this bill is 3/4 of a
 
01:40:19.350 --> 01:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
loaf and that's a loaf and a half uh we
 
01:40:21.510 --> 01:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
go with just a full loaf then yeah yeah
 
01:40:23.669 --> 01:40:23.679 align:start position:0%
so there you you definitely could and I
 
01:40:26.109 --> 01:40:26.119 align:start position:0%
think that there's some support for that
 
01:40:28.629 --> 01:40:28.639 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure there's broad political
 
01:40:30.470 --> 01:40:30.480 align:start position:0%
will for that particular practice
 
01:40:34.149 --> 01:40:34.159 align:start position:0%
without trying it this way first um
 
01:40:37.270 --> 01:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
certainly an interesting concept curious
 
01:40:38.390 --> 01:40:38.400 align:start position:0%
what some of the other folks had to
 
01:40:40.109 --> 01:40:40.119 align:start position:0%
think about it representative I see no
 
01:40:41.629 --> 01:40:41.639 align:start position:0%
language that doesn't mean it's not here
 
01:40:44.070 --> 01:40:44.080 align:start position:0%
it just means I don't see it um that
 
01:40:46.430 --> 01:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
would say to the schools now you have to
 
01:40:48.629 --> 01:40:48.639 align:start position:0%
let the parents of the children with
 
01:40:51.830 --> 01:40:51.840 align:start position:0%
IEPs know about this provision
 
01:40:53.589 --> 01:40:53.599 align:start position:0%
how would they find out yeah another
 
01:40:54.950 --> 01:40:54.960 align:start position:0%
great point and that's actually in the
 
01:40:56.430 --> 01:40:56.440 align:start position:0%
written testimony from the office of the
 
01:40:59.470 --> 01:40:59.480 align:start position:0%
child advocate um yeah it's on line 23
 
01:41:02.350 --> 01:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
I'm reading it yeah oh their testimony
 
01:41:04.709 --> 01:41:04.719 align:start position:0%
oh yeah great yeah and it's another very
 
01:41:08.669 --> 01:41:08.679 align:start position:0%
valid point um but I so no I don't have
 
01:41:11.149 --> 01:41:11.159 align:start position:0%
an answer for you okay I really don't I
 
01:41:13.229 --> 01:41:13.239 align:start position:0%
mean I don't I think that the interested
 
01:41:15.629 --> 01:41:15.639 align:start position:0%
parties such as those who brought this
 
01:41:18.149 --> 01:41:18.159 align:start position:0%
to our attention I have a feeling that
 
01:41:20.470 --> 01:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
word spreads fairly fast amongst that
 
01:41:20.480 --> 01:41:21.350 align:start position:0%
word spreads fairly fast amongst that
community

01:41:21.350 --> 01:41:21.360 align:start position:0%
community
 
01:41:22.990 --> 01:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
thank you like it did want the technical
 
01:41:24.470 --> 01:41:24.480 align:start position:0%
bulletin I got it before it even made it
 
01:41:26.510 --> 01:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
to the school
 
01:41:29.310 --> 01:41:29.320 align:start position:0%

bford uh thank you Mr chairman I have a
 
01:41:32.550 --> 01:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
question for
 
01:41:35.510 --> 01:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
Morin uh on your handout Morin on page
 
01:41:37.910 --> 01:41:37.920 align:start position:0%
12 you say increase in injuries there
 
01:41:39.629 --> 01:41:39.639 align:start position:0%
has been an increase in injuries of
 
01:41:43.149 --> 01:41:43.159 align:start position:0%
children who are restrained and secluded
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
there has been an increase in injuries
 
01:41:46.990 --> 01:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
to children who are placed in special
 
01:41:51.350 --> 01:41:51.360 align:start position:0%
education rooms and on page 30 you say
 
01:41:53.350 --> 01:41:53.360 align:start position:0%
we need to stop kids from being hurt
 
01:41:55.510 --> 01:41:55.520 align:start position:0%
today do you have any where did that
 
01:41:57.310 --> 01:41:57.320 align:start position:0%
data come from I know you didn't note
 
01:41:58.709 --> 01:41:58.719 align:start position:0%
the data on that
 
01:42:01.589 --> 01:42:01.599 align:start position:0%
page I I can absolutely get you the
 
01:42:04.870 --> 01:42:04.880 align:start position:0%
information on that data um so part of
 
01:42:07.790 --> 01:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
it is from one is from my own experience
 
01:42:09.390 --> 01:42:09.400 align:start position:0%
because I have been advocating for so
 
01:42:11.350 --> 01:42:11.360 align:start position:0%
long and the injuries have been getting
 
01:42:15.149 --> 01:42:15.159 align:start position:0%
hurt but I also researched it in um
 
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:42:21.310 --> 01:42:21.320 align:start position:0%

01:42:37.189 --> 01:42:37.199 align:start position:0%
follow up thank you Mr chairman thank
 
01:42:41.669 --> 01:42:41.679 align:start position:0%
you um are there more IEP students now
 
01:42:44.589 --> 01:42:44.599 align:start position:0%
than there used to be is has I know uh
 
01:42:46.270 --> 01:42:46.280 align:start position:0%
student population is going down but I'm
 
01:42:47.990 --> 01:42:48.000 align:start position:0%
wondering if the IEP students have been
 
01:42:50.030 --> 01:42:50.040 align:start position:0%
going up and that would of course skew
 
01:42:51.270 --> 01:42:51.280 align:start position:0%
the statistic
 
01:42:54.189 --> 01:42:54.199 align:start position:0%
someone if we're not keeping that in in
 
01:42:56.790 --> 01:42:56.800 align:start position:0%
percent wise uh I'm not sure of that
 
01:42:58.589 --> 01:42:58.599 align:start position:0%
information but I can I can get that for
 
01:43:02.070 --> 01:43:02.080 align:start position:0%

hiking um in Manchester when we started
 
01:44:22.189 --> 01:44:22.199 align:start position:0%
school they had a preschool program that
 
01:44:22.199 --> 01:44:23.830 align:start position:0%
school they had a preschool program that

was
 
01:44:27.070 --> 01:44:27.080 align:start position:0%
fantastic uh kindergarten came around
 
01:44:29.109 --> 01:44:29.119 align:start position:0%
and we requested extra support for
 
01:44:31.270 --> 01:44:31.280 align:start position:0%
philli in the general education
 
01:44:33.870 --> 01:44:33.880 align:start position:0%
classroom we were told he would get a
 
01:44:36.350 --> 01:44:36.360 align:start position:0%
paah shared with one other student we
 
01:44:38.550 --> 01:44:38.560 align:start position:0%
found out the per was there to support
 
01:44:39.790 --> 01:44:39.800 align:start position:0%
the whole
 
01:44:43.390 --> 01:44:43.400 align:start position:0%
class when discussing his IEP for first
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
grade we requested a one-on-one in
 
01:44:48.310 --> 01:44:48.320 align:start position:0%
general education we were told
 
01:44:50.709 --> 01:44:50.719 align:start position:0%
Manchester doesn't do Ono ones and we
 
01:44:52.070 --> 01:44:52.080 align:start position:0%
made to feel like we didn't have a
 
01:44:53.310 --> 01:44:53.320 align:start position:0%
choice but to put him in a
 
01:44:55.270 --> 01:44:55.280 align:start position:0%
self-contained classroom in order for
 
01:44:57.830 --> 01:44:57.840 align:start position:0%
him to get the support he
 
01:45:02.950 --> 01:45:02.960 align:start position:0%
needs so first grade Phillip um went to
 
01:45:05.990 --> 01:45:06.000 align:start position:0%
Highland and Philip started coming home
 
01:45:09.669 --> 01:45:09.679 align:start position:0%
with face injuries including bruises on
 
01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
his face swelling fat
 
01:45:16.070 --> 01:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
lip adult tooth knocked loose tooth cut
 
01:45:18.870 --> 01:45:18.880 align:start position:0%
onto the inside lip swollen jaw that
 
01:45:21.750 --> 01:45:21.760 align:start position:0%
lasted a couple of weeks
 
01:45:23.830 --> 01:45:23.840 align:start position:0%
we were told that those injuries were
 
01:45:24.950 --> 01:45:24.960 align:start position:0%
Tripp and
 
01:45:27.589 --> 01:45:27.599 align:start position:0%
Falls we we don't believe it Philip's
 
01:45:30.430 --> 01:45:30.440 align:start position:0%
not accident prone he's very active we
 
01:45:33.390 --> 01:45:33.400 align:start position:0%
do a lot of hiking outdoor
 
01:45:37.870 --> 01:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
stuff um we also he also started wetting
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
his pants in school and not at
 
01:45:44.790 --> 01:45:44.800 align:start position:0%
home we brought this up multiple times
 
01:45:47.870 --> 01:45:47.880 align:start position:0%
and we were told that he was just
 
01:45:49.910 --> 01:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
regressing feeling desperate and
 
01:45:52.310 --> 01:45:52.320 align:start position:0%
helpless I I decided to hire an advocate
 
01:45:54.510 --> 01:45:54.520 align:start position:0%
to get Philip out of the school my
 
01:45:56.350 --> 01:45:56.360 align:start position:0%
Advocate pulled the nurse's reports on
 
01:45:58.109 --> 01:45:58.119 align:start position:0%
his injuries and the reports had
 
01:46:00.990 --> 01:46:01.000 align:start position:0%
different accounts of what happened that
 
01:46:02.270 --> 01:46:02.280 align:start position:0%
what we were being
 
01:46:04.870 --> 01:46:04.880 align:start position:0%
told um that just didn't make sense
 
01:46:07.149 --> 01:46:07.159 align:start position:0%
including falling off a
 
01:46:09.990 --> 01:46:10.000 align:start position:0%
table we were able to pull Philip out of
 
01:46:11.149 --> 01:46:11.159 align:start position:0%
Highland and get him back to his
 
01:46:13.830 --> 01:46:13.840 align:start position:0%
neighborhood school for
 
01:46:18.550 --> 01:46:18.560 align:start position:0%
for um second grade with a one to one
 
01:46:20.470 --> 01:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
going through this awful experience
 
01:46:22.629 --> 01:46:22.639 align:start position:0%
motivated me to share my story with my
 
01:46:25.910 --> 01:46:25.920 align:start position:0%
local legislators last August you've got
 
01:46:29.470 --> 01:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
one minute left sir one minute
 
01:46:32.189 --> 01:46:32.199 align:start position:0%
left and also enroll in the UNH
 
01:46:33.990 --> 01:46:34.000 align:start position:0%
leadership program to learn to become a
 
01:46:36.589 --> 01:46:36.599 align:start position:0%
better advocate for my son a few weeks
 
01:46:38.750 --> 01:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
ago I saw in the news that a therapist
 
01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
that regularly worked with Philip at
 
01:46:43.750 --> 01:46:43.760 align:start position:0%
Highland last year was caught on
 
01:46:46.950 --> 01:46:46.960 align:start position:0%
camera and arrested for assaulting a
 
01:46:50.430 --> 01:46:50.440 align:start position:0%
non-verbal 7-year-old boy with autism
 
01:46:52.750 --> 01:46:52.760 align:start position:0%
what would you guys think about this if
 
01:46:54.189 --> 01:46:54.199 align:start position:0%
you were in my
 
01:46:57.470 --> 01:46:57.480 align:start position:0%
shoes I filed the police report I was
 
01:46:59.229 --> 01:46:59.239 align:start position:0%
told by the detective that it would be
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
difficult to press any charges because
 
01:47:04.709 --> 01:47:04.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:07.990 --> 01:47:08.000 align:start position:0%
statement um this bill is important to
 
01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:10.400 align:start position:0%
to me and my family because children
 
01:47:12.510 --> 01:47:12.520 align:start position:0%
without a voice need to be protected we
 
01:47:14.149 --> 01:47:14.159 align:start position:0%
need to restore safety and
 
01:47:17.070 --> 01:47:17.080 align:start position:0%
accountability in our classrooms I think
 
01:47:18.830 --> 01:47:18.840 align:start position:0%
this bill would be made stronger if we
 
01:47:20.589 --> 01:47:20.599 align:start position:0%
expanded it to cover all all the
 
01:47:22.350 --> 01:47:22.360 align:start position:0%
self-contained classrooms where our most
 
01:47:24.550 --> 01:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
vulnerable children are thank you for
 
01:47:27.790 --> 01:47:27.800 align:start position:0%
your testimony does anyone have any uh
 
01:47:31.950 --> 01:47:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:35.310 --> 01:47:35.320 align:start position:0%
day I see none thank you for your story
 
01:47:37.350 --> 01:47:37.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for your
 
01:47:44.589 --> 01:47:44.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
Caruso and once again three
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
minutes thank you
 
01:47:55.910 --> 01:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
um so um the dad of a 11-year-old
 
01:47:55.920 --> 01:47:57.709 align:start position:0%
um so um the dad of a 11-year-old
non-verbal

01:47:57.709 --> 01:47:57.719 align:start position:0%
non-verbal
 
01:48:02.109 --> 01:48:02.119 align:start position:0%
child uh early on in his school career
 
01:48:05.510 --> 01:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
he received several injuries um some of
 
01:48:06.669 --> 01:48:06.679 align:start position:0%
those are going to
 
01:48:11.709 --> 01:48:11.719 align:start position:0%
be uh for the rest of his life
 
01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
um along with that uh we had lots of
 
01:48:19.229 --> 01:48:19.239 align:start position:0%
issues um trying to
 
01:48:23.310 --> 01:48:23.320 align:start position:0%
decipher stories and figure out what
 
01:48:27.149 --> 01:48:27.159 align:start position:0%
happened uh took pictures filed
 
01:48:28.629 --> 01:48:28.639 align:start position:0%
complaints did everything we were
 
01:48:31.229 --> 01:48:31.239 align:start position:0%
supposed to do as parents to try and
 
01:48:32.510 --> 01:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
remedy the
 
01:48:32.520 --> 01:48:34.510 align:start position:0%
remedy the
situation

01:48:34.510 --> 01:48:34.520 align:start position:0%
situation
 
01:48:37.109 --> 01:48:37.119 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
through covid uh going to remote
 
01:48:45.030 --> 01:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
learning we learned a lot about his IEP
 
01:48:45.040 --> 01:48:46.990 align:start position:0%
learning we learned a lot about his IEP
team

01:48:46.990 --> 01:48:47.000 align:start position:0%
team
 
01:48:49.030 --> 01:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
dysfunction I think it's one of the
 
01:48:51.629 --> 01:48:51.639 align:start position:0%
things it's important to remember like
 
01:48:51.639 --> 01:48:53.470 align:start position:0%
things it's important to remember like
with

01:48:53.470 --> 01:48:53.480 align:start position:0%
with
 
01:48:56.790 --> 01:48:56.800 align:start position:0%
um special needs children it's the
 
01:48:59.149 --> 01:48:59.159 align:start position:0%
implementation of the
 
01:49:02.870 --> 01:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
programming sometimes that can
 
01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:06.080 align:start position:0%
cause difficulties with with the child
 
01:49:07.950 --> 01:49:07.960 align:start position:0%
not understanding different things like
 
01:49:11.149 --> 01:49:11.159 align:start position:0%
that however as we talk about like de
 
01:49:11.159 --> 01:49:13.229 align:start position:0%
that however as we talk about like de
escalating

01:49:13.229 --> 01:49:13.239 align:start position:0%
escalating
 
01:49:16.629 --> 01:49:16.639 align:start position:0%
um it's it's before they even escalate
 
01:49:19.669 --> 01:49:19.679 align:start position:0%
so what's happening prior to that's the
 
01:49:23.830 --> 01:49:23.840 align:start position:0%
problem as far as I see with with that
 
01:49:27.390 --> 01:49:27.400 align:start position:0%
uh and as we talk about seclusion rooms
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
in the many different names of those
 
01:49:32.350 --> 01:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
rooms so could be a break room sensory
 
01:49:35.189 --> 01:49:35.199 align:start position:0%
room uh there's multiple different
 
01:49:37.709 --> 01:49:37.719 align:start position:0%
levels of names for those types of
 
01:49:40.990 --> 01:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
spaces um it's important I support the
 
01:49:44.430 --> 01:49:44.440 align:start position:0%
bill uh accountability for the
 
01:49:47.270 --> 01:49:47.280 align:start position:0%
schools and the people with these
 
01:49:49.229 --> 01:49:49.239 align:start position:0%
children that are in areas especially
 
01:49:51.350 --> 01:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
non-verbal children children my child
 
01:49:53.910 --> 01:49:53.920 align:start position:0%
not being able to tell a story as a
 
01:49:58.790 --> 01:49:58.800 align:start position:0%
slightly overprotective dad uh you know
 
01:50:01.470 --> 01:50:01.480 align:start position:0%
that's what we do keep our kids safe um
 
01:50:05.070 --> 01:50:05.080 align:start position:0%
no matter what so um going through all
 
01:50:09.149 --> 01:50:09.159 align:start position:0%
those experiences he now is taught at
 
01:50:11.229 --> 01:50:11.239 align:start position:0%
home he's being
 
01:50:13.550 --> 01:50:13.560 align:start position:0%
homeschooled uh where he's safe and
 
01:50:18.430 --> 01:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
happy now he's he has a he's a gentle
 
01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:21.080 align:start position:0%
loving child so
 
01:50:24.629 --> 01:50:24.639 align:start position:0%
um but during some of those injuries I I
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
requested film footage and and video
 
01:50:31.189 --> 01:50:31.199 align:start position:0%
half a minute sir um and had very
 
01:50:32.669 --> 01:50:32.679 align:start position:0%
difficult time getting that from the
 
01:50:35.470 --> 01:50:35.480 align:start position:0%
school so I I think it's important for
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh video audio in these spaces with
 
01:50:37.920 --> 01:50:38.990 align:start position:0%
uh video audio in these spaces with
non-verbal

01:50:38.990 --> 01:50:39.000 align:start position:0%
non-verbal
 
01:50:41.470 --> 01:50:41.480 align:start position:0%
children thank you Mr Caruso any
 
01:50:44.109 --> 01:50:44.119 align:start position:0%
questions Vice chairman long thank you
 
01:50:45.629 --> 01:50:45.639 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman uh thank you your
 
01:50:47.470 --> 01:50:47.480 align:start position:0%
deescalation comment makes a lot of
 
01:50:50.950 --> 01:50:50.960 align:start position:0%
sense uh when your child was in school
 
01:50:55.189 --> 01:50:55.199 align:start position:0%
did he have an IEP he did and was video
 
01:50:58.109 --> 01:50:58.119 align:start position:0%
allowed uh no I actually requested
 
01:51:00.750 --> 01:51:00.760 align:start position:0%
several different things uh one was the
 
01:51:04.669 --> 01:51:04.679 align:start position:0%
video footage I also uh on my own at my
 
01:51:07.870 --> 01:51:07.880 align:start position:0%
own cost I would have supplied a person
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
to accompany him through his school day
 
01:51:12.830 --> 01:51:12.840 align:start position:0%
that worked for me and not the school
 
01:51:15.750 --> 01:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
district in order to keep him safe that
 
01:51:20.149 --> 01:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
was denied so so there's different uh I
 
01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
did everything I thought I could do to
 
01:51:24.750 --> 01:51:24.760 align:start position:0%
keep him in school and with his
 
01:51:27.990 --> 01:51:28.000 align:start position:0%
peers so okay thank thank you
 
01:51:30.030 --> 01:51:30.040 align:start position:0%
representative Bickford thank you Mr
 
01:51:33.669 --> 01:51:33.679 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you so your concern is
 
01:51:35.589 --> 01:51:35.599 align:start position:0%
you want cameras in the
 
01:51:37.709 --> 01:51:37.719 align:start position:0%
classroom it it doesn't sound like there
 
01:51:39.589 --> 01:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
was a restrain issue here it's a
 
01:51:42.669 --> 01:51:42.679 align:start position:0%
classroom issue or all allaround issue
 
01:51:44.709 --> 01:51:44.719 align:start position:0%
maybe I should say yeah I mean just to
 
01:51:47.990 --> 01:51:48.000 align:start position:0%
be clear like he had um there were rooms
 
01:51:51.030 --> 01:51:51.040 align:start position:0%
that were called senty rooms called what
 
01:51:53.550 --> 01:51:53.560 align:start position:0%
sensory rooms sensory okay yeah or and
 
01:51:55.790 --> 01:51:55.800 align:start position:0%
break rooms and and different they have
 
01:51:58.189 --> 01:51:58.199 align:start position:0%
different names but basically it's the
 
01:52:02.550 --> 01:52:02.560 align:start position:0%
same idea removed from everybody uh he
 
01:52:04.310 --> 01:52:04.320 align:start position:0%
would go in
 
01:52:07.750 --> 01:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
there and there's no video and audio in
 
01:52:11.350 --> 01:52:11.360 align:start position:0%
there to to tell us what happened so
 
01:52:14.510 --> 01:52:14.520 align:start position:0%
okay thank you just in no space not
 
01:52:17.109 --> 01:52:17.119 align:start position:0%
representative McMahon thank you Mr
 
01:52:19.629 --> 01:52:19.639 align:start position:0%
chairman Mr Cru who may ask what school
 
01:52:23.629 --> 01:52:23.639 align:start position:0%
district your in uh he was in uh Shaker
 
01:52:26.629 --> 01:52:26.639 align:start position:0%
Regional I'm I'm sorry he was in Shaker
 
01:52:29.149 --> 01:52:29.159 align:start position:0%
Regional School sh Regional One followup
 
01:52:32.510 --> 01:52:32.520 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman followup um relative to what
 
01:52:35.149 --> 01:52:35.159 align:start position:0%
uh you've stated and uh in what you've
 
01:52:36.510 --> 01:52:36.520 align:start position:0%
stated I believe is part of part of this
 
01:52:39.550 --> 01:52:39.560 align:start position:0%
is to have video and audio available uh
 
01:52:42.589 --> 01:52:42.599 align:start position:0%
this becomes a funding issue and within
 
01:52:46.589 --> 01:52:46.599 align:start position:0%
that uh that being said would you
 
01:52:48.830 --> 01:52:48.840 align:start position:0%
believe that we should be looking at a
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
requ a requirement with a funding uh
 
01:52:55.390 --> 01:52:55.400 align:start position:0%
adjunct to ensure that this is complied
 
01:52:56.990 --> 01:52:57.000 align:start position:0%
throughout our school districts in the
 
01:53:00.430 --> 01:53:00.440 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire I I do uh you
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
know with with special needs children uh
 
01:53:05.709 --> 01:53:05.719 align:start position:0%
the funding side is like the adult
 
01:53:09.470 --> 01:53:09.480 align:start position:0%
problem that shouldn't be passed down to
 
01:53:12.270 --> 01:53:12.280 align:start position:0%
the special needs kids in other words
 
01:53:14.149 --> 01:53:14.159 align:start position:0%
you know sure changing them because of
 
01:53:16.189 --> 01:53:16.199 align:start position:0%
the funding that's that's the adult
 
01:53:18.830 --> 01:53:18.840 align:start position:0%
problem but I it should be included okay
 
01:53:21.669 --> 01:53:21.679 align:start position:0%
one last followup follow up and Mr cruso
 
01:53:23.709 --> 01:53:23.719 align:start position:0%
um just so I understand correctly you
 
01:53:25.629 --> 01:53:25.639 align:start position:0%
said you had a difficult time asking for
 
01:53:28.390 --> 01:53:28.400 align:start position:0%
video does that imply that video
 
01:53:32.390 --> 01:53:32.400 align:start position:0%
existed uh well we tried to get video of
 
01:53:35.470 --> 01:53:35.480 align:start position:0%
certain um injuries that happened other
 
01:53:38.109 --> 01:53:38.119 align:start position:0%
words in the hallway and um you know it
 
01:53:40.390 --> 01:53:40.400 align:start position:0%
was explained that that might have been
 
01:53:43.390 --> 01:53:43.400 align:start position:0%
a blind spot in the camera there so it's
 
01:53:44.430 --> 01:53:44.440 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
01:53:47.069 --> 01:53:47.079 align:start position:0%
a you you know you're at a disadvantage
 
01:53:48.350 --> 01:53:48.360 align:start position:0%
because you're on the outside of the
 
01:53:51.350 --> 01:53:51.360 align:start position:0%
school uh so so you know once you once
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
the doors close you're you're kind of
 
01:53:57.310 --> 01:53:57.320 align:start position:0%
taking whatever they tell you whether it
 
01:53:59.430 --> 01:53:59.440 align:start position:0%
makes sense or not just one one more
 
01:54:02.149 --> 01:54:02.159 align:start position:0%
Point Mr CH one more one more absolutely
 
01:54:04.350 --> 01:54:04.360 align:start position:0%
uh regarding the pictures that we were
 
01:54:07.030 --> 01:54:07.040 align:start position:0%
looking at then the description from the
 
01:54:08.910 --> 01:54:08.920 align:start position:0%
authorities having jurisdiction stated
 
01:54:10.940 --> 01:54:10.950 align:start position:0%
they were based on falls in the
 
01:54:10.950 --> 01:54:13.189 align:start position:0%
they were based on falls in the
[Music]

01:54:13.189 --> 01:54:13.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:54:15.390 --> 01:54:15.400 align:start position:0%
school oh like like the other gentlem
 
01:54:16.709 --> 01:54:16.719 align:start position:0%
we're seeing what's taking place here I
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
wanted to tie to what you're talking
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:20.510 align:start position:0%
wanted to tie to what you're talking
about

01:54:20.510 --> 01:54:20.520 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:54:24.069 --> 01:54:24.079 align:start position:0%
can you were there any in injuries with
 
01:54:28.550 --> 01:54:28.560 align:start position:0%
your your children child and uh that
 
01:54:32.030 --> 01:54:32.040 align:start position:0%
were seen coming home at all that that's
 
01:54:34.270 --> 01:54:34.280 align:start position:0%
why you're asking for or or not asking
 
01:54:35.550 --> 01:54:35.560 align:start position:0%
but saying we should have audio and
 
01:54:37.189 --> 01:54:37.199 align:start position:0%
video there were many yes there were
 
01:54:39.189 --> 01:54:39.199 align:start position:0%
many and was there any explanation as to
 
01:54:42.910 --> 01:54:42.920 align:start position:0%
what caused those injuries uh not
 
01:54:45.910 --> 01:54:45.920 align:start position:0%
exactly uh full explanation no okay
 
01:54:48.189 --> 01:54:48.199 align:start position:0%
thank you sir representative
 
01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:50.760 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr Mr chairman and
 
01:54:52.950 --> 01:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
sir I do believe you when you say your
 
01:55:00.709 --> 01:55:00.719 align:start position:0%
child is a a gentle little boy my
 
01:55:04.550 --> 01:55:04.560 align:start position:0%
question to you sir is when you inquired
 
01:55:08.149 --> 01:55:08.159 align:start position:0%
why your child was placed in seclusion
 
01:55:12.069 --> 01:55:12.079 align:start position:0%
were you giving given any valid reasons
 
01:55:18.189 --> 01:55:18.199 align:start position:0%
and if so why your child's issue was not
 
01:55:22.149 --> 01:55:22.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:27.069 --> 01:55:27.079 align:start position:0%
audio so I it's when you're not in the
 
01:55:30.669 --> 01:55:30.679 align:start position:0%
school it's it's hard to understand what
 
01:55:34.470 --> 01:55:34.480 align:start position:0%
what's happening uh so typically like uh
 
01:55:37.470 --> 01:55:37.480 align:start position:0%
as it was said a sensory room would be
 
01:55:41.189 --> 01:55:41.199 align:start position:0%
something where he would go there
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
to um you know after doing some school
 
01:55:46.510 --> 01:55:46.520 align:start position:0%
workor and maybe go to the sentury room
 
01:55:50.629 --> 01:55:50.639 align:start position:0%
as kind of like to just chill L I guess
 
01:55:53.390 --> 01:55:53.400 align:start position:0%
um but that def you know according to
 
01:55:57.109 --> 01:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
the injuries I saw I I I have a lot of
 
01:55:57.119 --> 01:55:58.990 align:start position:0%
the injuries I saw I I I have a lot of
questions

01:55:58.990 --> 01:55:59.000 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:56:03.109 --> 01:56:03.119 align:start position:0%
but that's that's behind me now so I
 
01:56:06.069 --> 01:56:06.079 align:start position:0%
mean thank you for bringing this forward
 
01:56:09.950 --> 01:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
to us I appreciate that representative
 
01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
01:56:14.470 --> 01:56:14.480 align:start position:0%

01:56:15.790 --> 01:56:15.800 align:start position:0%
call I'm very sorry what happened to
 
01:56:19.550 --> 01:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
your son I'm um just trying to get a
 
01:56:21.510 --> 01:56:21.520 align:start position:0%
full understanding of the problem and
 
01:56:24.709 --> 01:56:24.719 align:start position:0%
issues here so if
 
01:56:30.470 --> 01:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
um did you um receive
 
01:56:30.480 --> 01:56:32.030 align:start position:0%
um did you um receive
um

01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:56:32.040 --> 01:56:33.870 align:start position:0%
um
any

01:56:33.870 --> 01:56:33.880 align:start position:0%
any
 
01:56:36.270 --> 01:56:36.280 align:start position:0%
um information
 
01:56:40.069 --> 01:56:40.079 align:start position:0%
documentation about your child's
 
01:56:40.079 --> 01:56:41.629 align:start position:0%
documentation about your child's
injuries

01:56:41.629 --> 01:56:41.639 align:start position:0%
injuries
 
01:56:48.030 --> 01:56:48.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:50.510 --> 01:56:50.520 align:start position:0%
restrained uh
 
01:56:54.149 --> 01:56:54.159 align:start position:0%
you know I I don't know if we received a
 
01:56:56.270 --> 01:56:56.280 align:start position:0%
whole lot of information in general
 
01:56:59.430 --> 01:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
about injuries um you would think that
 
01:57:02.189 --> 01:57:02.199 align:start position:0%
would be uh so when a child's injured in
 
01:57:05.149 --> 01:57:05.159 align:start position:0%
school there's a protocol that goes into
 
01:57:07.470 --> 01:57:07.480 align:start position:0%
action where everybody's informed
 
01:57:10.589 --> 01:57:10.599 align:start position:0%
reports are sent home um that kind of
 
01:57:12.669 --> 01:57:12.679 align:start position:0%
stuff uh didn't happen like unless we
 
01:57:13.990 --> 01:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
asked for
 
01:57:17.550 --> 01:57:17.560 align:start position:0%
information the nurses reports um so not
 
01:57:20.030 --> 01:57:20.040 align:start position:0%
all injuries were exactly
 
01:57:22.629 --> 01:57:22.639 align:start position:0%
recorded that way can I just have a
 
01:57:24.750 --> 01:57:24.760 align:start position:0%
follow follow up and I'm sorry I'm
 
01:57:26.229 --> 01:57:26.239 align:start position:0%
really not trying to grill you I'm just
 
01:57:29.270 --> 01:57:29.280 align:start position:0%
trying to get down to the root of the of
 
01:57:31.550 --> 01:57:31.560 align:start position:0%
the problem so I really appreciate you
 
01:57:35.470 --> 01:57:35.480 align:start position:0%

Wendy

01:58:03.589 --> 01:58:03.599 align:start position:0%
Wendy

fiser she's asking for three minutes you
 
01:58:11.270 --> 01:58:11.280 align:start position:0%
got it oh I might take four well
 
01:58:13.790 --> 01:58:13.800 align:start position:0%
no hi thank you all for your time today
 
01:58:17.430 --> 01:58:17.440 align:start position:0%
my name is Wendy fiser um I have a now
 
01:58:19.430 --> 01:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
11-year-old he was 10 at the time of the
 
01:58:22.030 --> 01:58:22.040 align:start position:0%
incident and he is in the nashaa school
 
01:58:25.109 --> 01:58:25.119 align:start position:0%
district uh my son went to Broad Street
 
01:58:30.189 --> 01:58:30.199 align:start position:0%
Elementary School he was in a program um
 
01:58:32.669 --> 01:58:32.679 align:start position:0%
called project achievement which is
 
01:58:35.030 --> 01:58:35.040 align:start position:0%
basically um a program that's in a
 
01:58:37.550 --> 01:58:37.560 align:start position:0%
segregated classroom with the idea of
 
01:58:39.750 --> 01:58:39.760 align:start position:0%
hoping to mainstream the child he had
 
01:58:42.950 --> 01:58:42.960 align:start position:0%
some um and still does social emotional
 
01:58:45.390 --> 01:58:45.400 align:start position:0%
um issues and that is or challenges and
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
that is why he is was in this particular
 
01:58:50.470 --> 01:58:50.480 align:start position:0%
uh program
 
01:58:52.750 --> 01:58:52.760 align:start position:0%
program so I'll back up just a little
 
01:58:55.030 --> 01:58:55.040 align:start position:0%
bit I was an active mom in the school
 
01:58:56.990 --> 01:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
PTO president I don't say that to tout
 
01:58:59.149 --> 01:58:59.159 align:start position:0%
myself but I was very much ingrained
 
01:59:01.270 --> 01:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
with the culture of Broad Street school
 
01:59:04.950 --> 01:59:04.960 align:start position:0%
so I felt very um I don't know if in the
 
01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
no was the right uh way to say this but
 
01:59:09.830 --> 01:59:09.840 align:start position:0%
I felt very comfortable in trusting the
 
01:59:12.990 --> 01:59:13.000 align:start position:0%
process of how my son was being educated
 
01:59:14.550 --> 01:59:14.560 align:start position:0%
and when they referred him into this
 
01:59:17.229 --> 01:59:17.239 align:start position:0%
program again I trusted the process I
 
01:59:19.430 --> 01:59:19.440 align:start position:0%
didn't fully understand the process and
 
01:59:22.149 --> 01:59:22.159 align:start position:0%
you learn what you need to learn or
 
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
after the fact when something tragic
 
01:59:27.750 --> 01:59:27.760 align:start position:0%
happens so back um I guess over the last
 
01:59:31.589 --> 01:59:31.599 align:start position:0%
three years from 2020 to March 28th
 
01:59:36.189 --> 01:59:36.199 align:start position:0%
2023 my son was placed um he was
 
01:59:39.149 --> 01:59:39.159 align:start position:0%
restrained over 30 times and placed in
 
01:59:41.790 --> 01:59:41.800 align:start position:0%
seclusion over
 
01:59:44.390 --> 01:59:44.400 align:start position:0%
40 the last time that he was placed in
 
01:59:47.069 --> 01:59:47.079 align:start position:0%
seclusion on March 28th
 
01:59:50.310 --> 01:59:50.320 align:start position:0%
2023 he took his sweatshir shirt off he
 
01:59:53.629 --> 01:59:53.639 align:start position:0%
was placed in seclusion for over an hour
 
01:59:55.350 --> 01:59:55.360 align:start position:0%
he took his sweatshirt off he wanted out
 
01:59:57.189 --> 01:59:57.199 align:start position:0%
of the room and he wrapped the
 
01:59:59.069 --> 01:59:59.079 align:start position:0%
sweatshirt around his neck and attempted
 
02:00:02.709 --> 02:00:02.719 align:start position:0%
to take his life while he was in that
 
02:00:04.750 --> 02:00:04.760 align:start position:0%
room this is really
 
02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:13.870 align:start position:0%
room this is really
overwhelming

02:00:13.870 --> 02:00:13.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.030 --> 02:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
so okay I didn't want that to happen
 
02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:18.149 align:start position:0%
so okay I didn't want that to happen
today

02:00:18.149 --> 02:00:18.159 align:start position:0%
today
 
02:00:21.629 --> 02:00:21.639 align:start position:0%
so thank you for bearing with
 
02:00:24.270 --> 02:00:24.280 align:start position:0%
me so on March 28th he attempted to take
 
02:00:29.069 --> 02:00:29.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:31.069 --> 02:00:31.079 align:start position:0%
seclusion Miss Raymond I would love to
 
02:00:33.270 --> 02:00:33.280 align:start position:0%
talk with you after because there are a
 
02:00:35.149 --> 02:00:35.159 align:start position:0%
bunch of Board of Education policies
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
that were
 
02:00:39.109 --> 02:00:39.119 align:start position:0%
not taken into consideration or
 
02:00:42.310 --> 02:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
completed or
 
02:00:47.189 --> 02:00:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:50.589 --> 02:00:50.599 align:start position:0%
time okay so
 
02:00:53.950 --> 02:00:53.960 align:start position:0%
he um over that time he was restrained
 
02:00:55.950 --> 02:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
secluded over the three years what I
 
02:00:57.629 --> 02:00:57.639 align:start position:0%
learned after the fact so I can just get
 
02:01:00.109 --> 02:01:00.119 align:start position:0%
to the end of my three minutes here is
 
02:01:02.750 --> 02:01:02.760 align:start position:0%
that um I'm hearing a lot of talk this
 
02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:05.079 align:start position:0%
is the benefit of going like third or
 
02:01:08.709 --> 02:01:08.719 align:start position:0%
fourth um talking about physical damage
 
02:01:10.430 --> 02:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
and what I'm not hearing any discussion
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
about is the mental damage that is
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
placed on the child that is consistently
 
02:01:17.669 --> 02:01:17.679 align:start position:0%
in um restraint and seclusion I'm asking
 
02:01:20.470 --> 02:01:20.480 align:start position:0%
for your support of this bu
 
02:01:22.870 --> 02:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
because the first thing I did what would
 
02:01:24.350 --> 02:01:24.360 align:start position:0%
be the first thing you would do as a
 
02:01:26.709 --> 02:01:26.719 align:start position:0%
parent if your child harmed himself in
 
02:01:28.830 --> 02:01:28.840 align:start position:0%
school while in
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
seclusion you would ask to see the
 
02:01:34.830 --> 02:01:34.840 align:start position:0%
videotape you so I did and I was met
 
02:01:37.109 --> 02:01:37.119 align:start position:0%
with we don't have videotape of that
 
02:01:39.669 --> 02:01:39.679 align:start position:0%
room my son is in one of the most
 
02:01:43.149 --> 02:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
intensive special need programs in the
 
02:01:46.350 --> 02:01:46.360 align:start position:0%
NASA school district and there are not
 
02:01:49.550 --> 02:01:49.560 align:start position:0%
cameras in the seclusion room
 
02:01:53.270 --> 02:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:56.430 --> 02:01:56.440 align:start position:0%
not that was a shock to me I had no idea
 
02:01:57.830 --> 02:01:57.840 align:start position:0%
I knew that there were cameras in school
 
02:01:59.669 --> 02:01:59.679 align:start position:0%
you can see them in the hallways I just
 
02:02:02.669 --> 02:02:02.679 align:start position:0%
assumed as a mom that there were cameras
 
02:02:06.189 --> 02:02:06.199 align:start position:0%
in this area they're not would you take
 
02:02:09.310 --> 02:02:09.320 align:start position:0%
some questions from the uh committee yes
 
02:02:11.589 --> 02:02:11.599 align:start position:0%
but before we do well you only have
 
02:02:13.350 --> 02:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
about 20 seconds and I've already let
 
02:02:15.830 --> 02:02:15.840 align:start position:0%
you go over so all right so someone
 
02:02:17.550 --> 02:02:17.560 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Dignity of the child and
 
02:02:20.069 --> 02:02:20.079 align:start position:0%
protecting the Dignity of the child
 
02:02:22.470 --> 02:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
when a child is placed in seclusion in a
 
02:02:24.990 --> 02:02:25.000 align:start position:0%
special ed classroom and he's regul
 
02:02:27.990 --> 02:02:28.000 align:start position:0%
regulated to um this smaller room the
 
02:02:30.750 --> 02:02:30.760 align:start position:0%
Dignity of the child is already
 
02:02:33.109 --> 02:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
gone so you know what bring on the
 
02:02:35.310 --> 02:02:35.320 align:start position:0%
cameras to hold on accountability to
 
02:02:37.629 --> 02:02:37.639 align:start position:0%
those that are in this that are managing
 
02:02:39.310 --> 02:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
this program in the
 
02:02:43.109 --> 02:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
school do we have any questions for uh
 
02:02:43.119 --> 02:02:44.390 align:start position:0%
school do we have any questions for uh
Miss

02:02:44.390 --> 02:02:44.400 align:start position:0%
Miss
 
02:02:46.830 --> 02:02:46.840 align:start position:0%
fiser representative
 
02:02:49.790 --> 02:02:49.800 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman Pearson and
 
02:02:51.390 --> 02:02:51.400 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for your testimony and
 
02:02:52.990 --> 02:02:53.000 align:start position:0%
I'm terribly sorry to hear what happened
 
02:02:55.069 --> 02:02:55.079 align:start position:0%
to your son um I am the one who
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
mentioned the Dignity of the the student
 
02:02:59.069 --> 02:02:59.079 align:start position:0%
and I absolutely agree with you
 
02:03:01.229 --> 02:03:01.239 align:start position:0%
protecting the Dignity of the student
 
02:03:03.990 --> 02:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
means treating that CH student as a
 
02:03:07.189 --> 02:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
valued human being and protecting their
 
02:03:10.030 --> 02:03:10.040 align:start position:0%
integrity and their feelings and all the
 
02:03:12.229 --> 02:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
parts about them so I'm especially sorry
 
02:03:14.550 --> 02:03:14.560 align:start position:0%
to hear all of these stories um
 
02:03:16.550 --> 02:03:16.560 align:start position:0%
certainly never happened um in the
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
school that I was in thank goodness
 
02:03:24.109 --> 02:03:24.119 align:start position:0%
um would you think that this bill could
 
02:03:26.550 --> 02:03:26.560 align:start position:0%
be improved if there was some type of a
 
02:03:28.790 --> 02:03:28.800 align:start position:0%
requirement given that the school
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
districts now the public school
 
02:03:32.229 --> 02:03:32.239 align:start position:0%
districts in order to not outplay
 
02:03:34.109 --> 02:03:34.119 align:start position:0%
children are creating these programs
 
02:03:35.950 --> 02:03:35.960 align:start position:0%
within their school should there be a
 
02:03:38.510 --> 02:03:38.520 align:start position:0%
requirement that in these very intensive
 
02:03:40.990 --> 02:03:41.000 align:start position:0%
programs within the school that there be
 
02:03:45.910 --> 02:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
video cameras in all areas yes thank
 
02:03:48.830 --> 02:03:48.840 align:start position:0%
you any other questions represent
 
02:03:51.470 --> 02:03:51.480 align:start position:0%
resentative long thank you uh Mr
 
02:03:54.430 --> 02:03:54.440 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you Miss Fischer uh I
 
02:03:56.990 --> 02:03:57.000 align:start position:0%
certainly uh am aware of the mental
 
02:04:00.310 --> 02:04:00.320 align:start position:0%
effect on a child that that's
 
02:04:03.910 --> 02:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
unacceptable um so do you truly believe
 
02:04:06.510 --> 02:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
that passage of this bill that you would
 
02:04:08.189 --> 02:04:08.199 align:start position:0%
get the answers you
 
02:04:12.910 --> 02:04:12.920 align:start position:0%
need when uh on audio and video inside a
 
02:04:16.510 --> 02:04:16.520 align:start position:0%
seclusion room I mean it it it seems
 
02:04:20.069 --> 02:04:20.079 align:start position:0%
that a lot of this is happening prior to
 
02:04:21.350 --> 02:04:21.360 align:start position:0%
um but at the time they're in the
 
02:04:21.360 --> 02:04:23.669 align:start position:0%
um but at the time they're in the
seclusion

02:04:23.669 --> 02:04:23.679 align:start position:0%
seclusion
 
02:04:27.109 --> 02:04:27.119 align:start position:0%
room you know so so you know I just need
 
02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
your assurance that you believe this
 
02:04:31.270 --> 02:04:31.280 align:start position:0%
passage you would get your answers I'm
 
02:04:35.430 --> 02:04:35.440 align:start position:0%
not sure of that that's kind of like
 
02:04:36.750 --> 02:04:36.760 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of answers to that
 
02:04:39.510 --> 02:04:39.520 align:start position:0%
question that you're asking so I guess
 
02:04:42.430 --> 02:04:42.440 align:start position:0%
the short answer is yes in this
 
02:04:44.790 --> 02:04:44.800 align:start position:0%
particular instance on March 28th I
 
02:04:47.470 --> 02:04:47.480 align:start position:0%
would have the answers of what happened
 
02:04:49.870 --> 02:04:49.880 align:start position:0%
it's a lot of he said she she said type
 
02:04:52.470 --> 02:04:52.480 align:start position:0%
of dialogue that has been going on so in
 
02:04:54.910 --> 02:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
this instance but what I will say is if
 
02:04:58.629 --> 02:04:58.639 align:start position:0%
that we had cameras in seclusion rooms
 
02:05:00.950 --> 02:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
monitoring the behavior of not only the
 
02:05:02.950 --> 02:05:02.960 align:start position:0%
teacher and the child and I don't want
 
02:05:04.430 --> 02:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
to use the word monitoring because what
 
02:05:06.950 --> 02:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
I want to come out of this at the end is
 
02:05:06.960 --> 02:05:08.189 align:start position:0%
I want to come out of this at the end is
more

02:05:08.189 --> 02:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
more
 
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
training and the
 
02:05:13.350 --> 02:05:13.360 align:start position:0%
staff there's nothing better than
 
02:05:15.910 --> 02:05:15.920 align:start position:0%
playback video right when you're in the
 
02:05:17.629 --> 02:05:17.639 align:start position:0%
Heat of the Moment you're not going to
 
02:05:20.270 --> 02:05:20.280 align:start position:0%
remember what said what you did what the
 
02:05:20.280 --> 02:05:22.310 align:start position:0%
remember what said what you did what the
child

02:05:22.310 --> 02:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
child
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
did what is important is to have the
 
02:05:30.069 --> 02:05:30.079 align:start position:0%
video is feedback footage doesn't
 
02:05:33.030 --> 02:05:33.040 align:start position:0%
lie so if we can take this footage and
 
02:05:36.030 --> 02:05:36.040 align:start position:0%
not only protect the teacher the child
 
02:05:38.189 --> 02:05:38.199 align:start position:0%
and everybody involved with what's going
 
02:05:39.910 --> 02:05:39.920 align:start position:0%
on in that particular moment at that
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
particular time if we can take that
 
02:05:44.870 --> 02:05:44.880 align:start position:0%
footage and actually
 
02:05:47.990 --> 02:05:48.000 align:start position:0%
train the folks that are leading these
 
02:05:50.830 --> 02:05:50.840 align:start position:0%
highly intense ensive programs that
 
02:05:53.910 --> 02:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
involve restraint and
 
02:05:56.069 --> 02:05:56.079 align:start position:0%
seclusion then one not only are we
 
02:05:58.030 --> 02:05:58.040 align:start position:0%
holding them accountable but two we can
 
02:06:00.990 --> 02:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:02.790 --> 02:06:02.800 align:start position:0%
process does that answer question
 
02:06:04.510 --> 02:06:04.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate that it does thank you
 
02:06:06.830 --> 02:06:06.840 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
02:06:09.069 --> 02:06:09.079 align:start position:0%
chairman so if I understand this
 
02:06:11.189 --> 02:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
correctly um please correct me if I'm
 
02:06:17.430 --> 02:06:17.440 align:start position:0%
wrong but the the overall um goal is for
 
02:06:20.149 --> 02:06:20.159 align:start position:0%
Less restraints and if there was videos
 
02:06:22.750 --> 02:06:22.760 align:start position:0%
on the staff interactions with the child
 
02:06:26.109 --> 02:06:26.119 align:start position:0%
then we would have less restraint usage
 
02:06:29.950 --> 02:06:29.960 align:start position:0%
overall is that your understanding um
 
02:06:31.990 --> 02:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
that would be the goal yes so Moren has
 
02:06:33.589 --> 02:06:33.599 align:start position:0%
already sort of touched upon that that
 
02:06:35.510 --> 02:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
that's we want to reduce the amount of
 
02:06:37.669 --> 02:06:37.679 align:start position:0%
time people are restrained and people do
 
02:06:38.870 --> 02:06:38.880 align:start position:0%
behave differently when they know
 
02:06:41.750 --> 02:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
they're on camera it's a fact
 
02:06:45.310 --> 02:06:45.320 align:start position:0%
and for us yes it would be training it
 
02:06:47.669 --> 02:06:47.679 align:start position:0%
would be training to help reduce that's
 
02:06:49.270 --> 02:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
the back end of this story is we're all
 
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
focusing on the cameras in the room but
 
02:06:54.109 --> 02:06:54.119 align:start position:0%
what's the what's the the next step is
 
02:06:57.270 --> 02:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
to take that footage and be able to go
 
02:06:59.830 --> 02:06:59.840 align:start position:0%
through that footage with the people
 
02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
that are involved with what's going on
 
02:07:05.950 --> 02:07:05.960 align:start position:0%
that day and train them properly we do
 
02:07:08.990 --> 02:07:09.000 align:start position:0%
not have properly trained people I'm
 
02:07:11.149 --> 02:07:11.159 align:start position:0%
going to speak specifically for NASA
 
02:07:13.990 --> 02:07:14.000 align:start position:0%
that are running the project achievement
 
02:07:17.270 --> 02:07:17.280 align:start position:0%
program we have moms off the
 
02:07:20.750 --> 02:07:20.760 align:start position:0%
street that par Educators placed in a
 
02:07:24.270 --> 02:07:24.280 align:start position:0%
classroom with highly intensive need
 
02:07:27.589 --> 02:07:27.599 align:start position:0%
kiddos and it's not right and that is
 
02:07:29.310 --> 02:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
when your son is in fight or flight the
 
02:07:31.350 --> 02:07:31.360 align:start position:0%
entire time that they are in
 
02:07:34.589 --> 02:07:34.599 align:start position:0%
school that par educator they're not
 
02:07:40.750 --> 02:07:40.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:43.390 --> 02:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
02:07:46.229 --> 02:07:46.239 align:start position:0%
deimon thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
02:07:49.470 --> 02:07:49.480 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question and
 
02:07:51.669 --> 02:07:51.679 align:start position:0%
I I my heart's broken for what you've
 
02:07:51.679 --> 02:07:52.950 align:start position:0%
I I my heart's broken for what you've
gone

02:07:52.950 --> 02:07:52.960 align:start position:0%
gone
 
02:07:57.910 --> 02:07:57.920 align:start position:0%
through would you agree ma'am
 
02:08:01.229 --> 02:08:01.239 align:start position:0%
that psychologically we are
 
02:08:04.830 --> 02:08:04.840 align:start position:0%
made to immediately report how something
 
02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:07.360 align:start position:0%
feels not how something actually
 
02:08:12.030 --> 02:08:12.040 align:start position:0%
happened therefore video and audio are
 
02:08:15.270 --> 02:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
Paramount to getting to the truth and
 
02:08:18.549 --> 02:08:18.559 align:start position:0%
Crux of any situation that is a great
 
02:08:18.559 --> 02:08:20.030 align:start position:0%
Crux of any situation that is a great
question

02:08:20.030 --> 02:08:20.040 align:start position:0%
question
 
02:08:22.750 --> 02:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
and in any of our situations for the
 
02:08:24.510 --> 02:08:24.520 align:start position:0%
folks sitting behind me it's highly
 
02:08:27.750 --> 02:08:27.760 align:start position:0%
emotional right we just want data so if
 
02:08:30.189 --> 02:08:30.199 align:start position:0%
you put a video in front of me with
 
02:08:33.189 --> 02:08:33.199 align:start position:0%
audio that's just data I can remove the
 
02:08:36.950 --> 02:08:36.960 align:start position:0%
feelings from that and and manage the
 
02:08:42.149 --> 02:08:42.159 align:start position:0%
data so yes thank you very much anyone
 
02:08:45.189 --> 02:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
else uh can I just add one little thing
 
02:08:47.510 --> 02:08:47.520 align:start position:0%
uh no I'm afraid you can't because we're
 
02:08:49.750 --> 02:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
really way over time so thank you Miss

Elementary School the best way I can
 
02:09:51.990 --> 02:09:52.000 align:start position:0%
describe what my daughter went through
 
02:09:54.270 --> 02:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
is sheer
 
02:09:56.030 --> 02:09:56.040 align:start position:0%
hell she
 
02:09:58.790 --> 02:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
began having really bad behaviors and I
 
02:10:00.910 --> 02:10:00.920 align:start position:0%
was being called all the time to come
 
02:10:03.629 --> 02:10:03.639 align:start position:0%
and pick her up from school she's always
 
02:10:05.229 --> 02:10:05.239 align:start position:0%
had her fair share of struggles but
 
02:10:07.270 --> 02:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
never anything like this I didn't know
 
02:10:10.030 --> 02:10:10.040 align:start position:0%
what was going on after I was approached
 
02:10:11.669 --> 02:10:11.679 align:start position:0%
by the school to agree to a half a day
 
02:10:14.229 --> 02:10:14.239 align:start position:0%
of school from my daughter I knew I
 
02:10:15.950 --> 02:10:15.960 align:start position:0%
needed to do something and figure out
 
02:10:19.069 --> 02:10:19.079 align:start position:0%
what exactly was going on I hired an
 
02:10:21.790 --> 02:10:21.800 align:start position:0%
educational Advocate
 
02:10:24.030 --> 02:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
Moren in the meantime my daughter was
 
02:10:25.830 --> 02:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
also suspended and was not welcomed back
 
02:10:27.310 --> 02:10:27.320 align:start position:0%
to the school unless I met with a
 
02:10:30.350 --> 02:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
superintendent I knew this was wrong not
 
02:10:32.470 --> 02:10:32.480 align:start position:0%
one person decides the fate of a child
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
there's an IEP team for a
 
02:10:36.830 --> 02:10:36.840 align:start position:0%
reason with the help of my Advocate we
 
02:10:38.750 --> 02:10:38.760 align:start position:0%
found out my daughter was restrained and
 
02:10:40.589 --> 02:10:40.599 align:start position:0%
also put in a seclusion room more times
 
02:10:43.510 --> 02:10:43.520 align:start position:0%
than I can count in addition there was
 
02:10:45.629 --> 02:10:45.639 align:start position:0%
very little communication almost no
 
02:10:47.950 --> 02:10:47.960 align:start position:0%
communication from the school about any
 
02:10:49.430 --> 02:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
of this
 
02:10:51.589 --> 02:10:51.599 align:start position:0%
this we also found out they were not
 
02:10:53.470 --> 02:10:53.480 align:start position:0%
following her IEP and had changed her
 
02:10:55.830 --> 02:10:55.840 align:start position:0%
routine she had been following for years
 
02:10:58.589 --> 02:10:58.599 align:start position:0%
all without my knowledge her behaviors
 
02:11:01.270 --> 02:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
were all starting to make sense there
 
02:11:03.149 --> 02:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
are many things the school failed to do
 
02:11:04.870 --> 02:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
but if cameras had been in the seclusion
 
02:11:07.510 --> 02:11:07.520 align:start position:0%
room or or there while she was being
 
02:11:09.750 --> 02:11:09.760 align:start position:0%
restrained I would know what actual
 
02:11:11.310 --> 02:11:11.320 align:start position:0%
trauma my daughter
 
02:11:13.589 --> 02:11:13.599 align:start position:0%
endured to this day I really don't know
 
02:11:15.390 --> 02:11:15.400 align:start position:0%
what happened except what the school has
 
02:11:17.430 --> 02:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
told me and clearly they haven't been
 
02:11:20.669 --> 02:11:20.679 align:start position:0%
very forthright up until this point what
 
02:11:22.510 --> 02:11:22.520 align:start position:0%
I do know is moving her out of this
 
02:11:24.430 --> 02:11:24.440 align:start position:0%
environment and up to the Middle School
 
02:11:27.030 --> 02:11:27.040 align:start position:0%
still in the same district has been
 
02:11:29.549 --> 02:11:29.559 align:start position:0%
life-changing for her she is making
 
02:11:32.350 --> 02:11:32.360 align:start position:0%
tremendous progress all I have done with
 
02:11:34.189 --> 02:11:34.199 align:start position:0%
the help of my amazing Advocate is hold
 
02:11:35.189 --> 02:11:35.199 align:start position:0%
the school
 
02:11:37.589 --> 02:11:37.599 align:start position:0%
accountable cameras would be another way
 
02:11:38.990 --> 02:11:39.000 align:start position:0%
to assist in holding the school
 
02:11:41.470 --> 02:11:41.480 align:start position:0%
accountable and hopefully preventing any
 
02:11:44.350 --> 02:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
more trauma on our children we send our
 
02:11:45.750 --> 02:11:45.760 align:start position:0%
children to school in hopes they will
 
02:11:47.629 --> 02:11:47.639 align:start position:0%
build relationships learn the skills
 
02:11:49.990 --> 02:11:50.000 align:start position:0%
they need to succeed in life all while
 
02:11:52.669 --> 02:11:52.679 align:start position:0%
having fun with their peers no one sends
 
02:11:54.189 --> 02:11:54.199 align:start position:0%
their child to school expecting their
 
02:11:55.229 --> 02:11:55.239 align:start position:0%
child to be
 
02:11:57.470 --> 02:11:57.480 align:start position:0%
traumatized please consider supporting
 
02:11:59.109 --> 02:11:59.119 align:start position:0%

Moren came to work with me because she's
 
02:15:14.189 --> 02:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
working with my adult daughter and the
 
02:15:16.470 --> 02:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
struggles she has in our
 
02:15:18.589 --> 02:15:18.599 align:start position:0%
world um
 
02:15:20.830 --> 02:15:20.840 align:start position:0%
what is astonishing about the testimony
 
02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:21.589 align:start position:0%
what is astonishing about the testimony
here

02:15:21.589 --> 02:15:21.599 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:15:25.189 --> 02:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
is I feel like I know every story they
 
02:15:30.350 --> 02:15:30.360 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:34.149 --> 02:15:34.159 align:start position:0%
school including being sexually abused
 
02:15:36.390 --> 02:15:36.400 align:start position:0%
and forced to do a police
 
02:15:40.549 --> 02:15:40.559 align:start position:0%
interview when she operates at the level
 
02:15:41.910 --> 02:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
of a first
 
02:15:45.189 --> 02:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
grader she was forced to go up where the
 
02:15:47.549 --> 02:15:47.559 align:start position:0%
police asked her questions when she came
 
02:15:50.310 --> 02:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
out she said a sense she's never said to
 
02:15:54.589 --> 02:15:54.599 align:start position:0%
us before I didn't do it I didn't do
 
02:15:59.270 --> 02:15:59.280 align:start position:0%
these things the very idea that lying
 
02:16:02.229 --> 02:16:02.239 align:start position:0%
she be lying was news to
 
02:16:02.239 --> 02:16:04.189 align:start position:0%
she be lying was news to
her

02:16:04.189 --> 02:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
her
 
02:16:08.549 --> 02:16:08.559 align:start position:0%
so although I think this bill has to be
 
02:16:10.549 --> 02:16:10.559 align:start position:0%
passed and somebody said baby steps
 
02:16:14.910 --> 02:16:14.920 align:start position:0%
that's great the truth is our culture is
 
02:16:17.149 --> 02:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
a seclusion room for people with
 
02:16:19.629 --> 02:16:19.639 align:start position:0%
disabilities they're left behind and
 
02:16:22.790 --> 02:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
ignored at every level and when they
 
02:16:24.830 --> 02:16:24.840 align:start position:0%
come in contact with for example the
 
02:16:26.510 --> 02:16:26.520 align:start position:0%
police department the police department
 
02:16:29.229 --> 02:16:29.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't have a clue how to talk to my
 
02:16:31.390 --> 02:16:31.400 align:start position:0%
daughter and find out what's true so
 
02:16:33.709 --> 02:16:33.719 align:start position:0%
that I heard the thing of oh he couldn't
 
02:16:37.830 --> 02:16:37.840 align:start position:0%
testify so we can't do anything so um I
 
02:16:40.870 --> 02:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
I simply want to say boy I would have
 
02:16:42.950 --> 02:16:42.960 align:start position:0%
loved it if there was video when we were
 
02:16:45.910 --> 02:16:45.920 align:start position:0%
in a school which we were lied to so
 
02:16:48.870 --> 02:16:48.880 align:start position:0%
many times it was
 
02:16:50.910 --> 02:16:50.920 align:start position:0%
it was news to me that people could lie
 
02:16:55.349 --> 02:16:55.359 align:start position:0%
at the level they were lying at so I I
 
02:16:57.629 --> 02:16:57.639 align:start position:0%
as actually I'm a consultant schools
 
02:16:59.509 --> 02:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
I've been to Broad Street school for
 
02:17:01.750 --> 02:17:01.760 align:start position:0%
five years as a consultant working with
 
02:17:03.950 --> 02:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
them using visual tools I think it's a
 
02:17:05.990 --> 02:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
great school but I also
 
02:17:06.000 --> 02:17:07.589 align:start position:0%
great school but I also

02:17:07.589 --> 02:17:07.599 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:17:10.150 --> 02:17:10.160 align:start position:0%
that what happens at one end of the hall
 
02:17:12.190 --> 02:17:12.200 align:start position:0%
may not be what happens at the other end
 
02:17:13.509 --> 02:17:13.519 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:17:16.309 --> 02:17:16.319 align:start position:0%

02:17:32.950 --> 02:17:32.960 align:start position:0%
Bowden you've asked for two minutes
 
02:17:35.150 --> 02:17:35.160 align:start position:0%
stretch it a little would you have a
 
02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:37.359 align:start position:0%
three minute rule here thank you
 
02:17:40.309 --> 02:17:40.319 align:start position:0%
chairman Pearson um for the record my
 
02:17:43.070 --> 02:17:43.080 align:start position:0%

Policy

02:17:44.389 --> 02:17:44.399 align:start position:0%
Policy
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
professional uh and served for six years
 
02:17:48.110 --> 02:17:48.120 align:start position:0%
on the state of
 
02:17:51.030 --> 02:17:51.040 align:start position:0%
advisory committee on the education of
 
02:17:53.589 --> 02:17:53.599 align:start position:0%
students with disabilities as their
 
02:17:57.709 --> 02:17:57.719 align:start position:0%
chair um I don't have a story to share
 
02:18:00.509 --> 02:18:00.519 align:start position:0%
with you my son who had KN he was not
 
02:18:02.790 --> 02:18:02.800 align:start position:0%
secluded and restrained but I'm here as
 
02:18:06.790 --> 02:18:06.800 align:start position:0%
a policy expert and I wanted to share a
 
02:18:10.509 --> 02:18:10.519 align:start position:0%
few additional sort of fundamental ideas
 
02:18:14.389 --> 02:18:14.399 align:start position:0%
including that
 
02:18:18.469 --> 02:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
um teachers and other staff that schools
 
02:18:21.509 --> 02:18:21.519 align:start position:0%
are well intentioned and trained and do
 
02:18:24.750 --> 02:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
do an overall very good job however
 
02:18:29.190 --> 02:18:29.200 align:start position:0%
structurally schools are hot beds of
 
02:18:31.309 --> 02:18:31.319 align:start position:0%
unconscious bias against students with
 
02:18:34.790 --> 02:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
disabilities that's why we have separate
 
02:18:37.270 --> 02:18:37.280 align:start position:0%
educational system for them it's we call
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
it special education but it in fact is a
 
02:18:43.870 --> 02:18:43.880 align:start position:0%
segregated educational system and that
 
02:18:43.880 --> 02:18:44.870 align:start position:0%
segregated educational system and that
that

02:18:44.870 --> 02:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:18:48.110 --> 02:18:48.120 align:start position:0%
inadvertently has a mindset of my my
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
students and those students um it leads
 
02:18:55.709 --> 02:18:55.719 align:start position:0%
to ideas for instance this this
 
02:18:57.830 --> 02:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
unconscious bias against students with
 
02:19:00.190 --> 02:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
disabilities that there is a presumption
 
02:19:02.910 --> 02:19:02.920 align:start position:0%
that the behavior that students have is
 
02:19:04.629 --> 02:19:04.639 align:start position:0%
solely because of the
 
02:19:07.629 --> 02:19:07.639 align:start position:0%
student right and we need we need to
 
02:19:10.830 --> 02:19:10.840 align:start position:0%
bear in mind that behaviors are a form
 
02:19:12.950 --> 02:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
of communication and if you're in a hot
 
02:19:15.549 --> 02:19:15.559 align:start position:0%
bed of unconscious bias in a in a
 
02:19:17.750 --> 02:19:17.760 align:start position:0%
building where you do not have a feeling
 
02:19:17.760 --> 02:19:18.950 align:start position:0%
building where you do not have a feeling
of

02:19:18.950 --> 02:19:18.960 align:start position:0%
of
 
02:19:22.950 --> 02:19:22.960 align:start position:0%
belonging I I would start Behaving Badly
 
02:19:28.349 --> 02:19:28.359 align:start position:0%
too um I would also add that
 
02:19:31.389 --> 02:19:31.399 align:start position:0%
um just because a student does not have
 
02:19:34.230 --> 02:19:34.240 align:start position:0%
the ability to use words to communicate
 
02:19:36.349 --> 02:19:36.359 align:start position:0%
does not mean that they are not
 
02:19:39.389 --> 02:19:39.399 align:start position:0%
thinking i' like to use the metaphor
 
02:19:44.309 --> 02:19:44.319 align:start position:0%
that we may not have the
 
02:19:47.150 --> 02:19:47.160 align:start position:0%
um the Rosetta Stone on the mind of
 
02:19:48.710 --> 02:19:48.720 align:start position:0%
student students who don't use words to
 
02:19:50.670 --> 02:19:50.680 align:start position:0%
communicate but their noodles are filled
 
02:19:54.309 --> 02:19:54.319 align:start position:0%
with thoughts ideas preferences desires
 
02:19:57.349 --> 02:19:57.359 align:start position:0%
dreams and hopes even if we do not yet
 
02:20:01.389 --> 02:20:01.399 align:start position:0%
have the technology to give the to to to
 
02:20:03.030 --> 02:20:03.040 align:start position:0%
translate what might be going on in
 
02:20:04.990 --> 02:20:05.000 align:start position:0%
their minds for those students who are
 
02:20:06.910 --> 02:20:06.920 align:start position:0%
called quote unquote non-verbal that
 
02:20:14.830 --> 02:20:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:17.590 --> 02:20:17.600 align:start position:0%
fundamentally restraint and seclusion is
 
02:20:19.590 --> 02:20:19.600 align:start position:0%
traumatizing for the student and that it
 
02:20:21.389 --> 02:20:21.399 align:start position:0%
should be at the center of your minds
 
02:20:23.670 --> 02:20:23.680 align:start position:0%
when you're thinking about this bill and
 
02:20:27.670 --> 02:20:27.680 align:start position:0%
I give you another half minute
 
02:20:30.750 --> 02:20:30.760 align:start position:0%
okay until we can fix the challenge of
 
02:20:33.870 --> 02:20:33.880 align:start position:0%
segregated education for students with
 
02:20:36.710 --> 02:20:36.720 align:start position:0%
disabilities we need to have and and
 
02:20:39.710 --> 02:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
create places of belonging for them we
 
02:20:42.830 --> 02:20:42.840 align:start position:0%
need to have measures that hold schools
 
02:20:45.309 --> 02:20:45.319 align:start position:0%
accountable and we need to have measures
 
02:20:48.870 --> 02:20:48.880 align:start position:0%
that protect students with disabilities
 
02:20:53.389 --> 02:20:53.399 align:start position:0%
from the trauma that they are currently
 
02:20:55.990 --> 02:20:56.000 align:start position:0%
experiencing we cannot fix the challenge
 
02:20:59.309 --> 02:20:59.319 align:start position:0%
in our schools tomorrow but until we do
 
02:21:03.110 --> 02:21:03.120 align:start position:0%
video cameras is one way to make sure
 
02:21:06.110 --> 02:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
that everybody has the same information
 
02:21:09.230 --> 02:21:09.240 align:start position:0%
about what's happening seclusion rooms
 
02:21:12.309 --> 02:21:12.319 align:start position:0%
are fundamentally bad practice and they
 
02:21:16.230 --> 02:21:16.240 align:start position:0%
need to stop any questions for Miss
 
02:21:19.070 --> 02:21:19.080 align:start position:0%
Bodwin sing none thank you for your
 
02:21:22.510 --> 02:21:22.520 align:start position:0%
testimony and the final person to come
 
02:21:25.429 --> 02:21:25.439 align:start position:0%
before us today is Karen
 
02:21:27.950 --> 02:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg from the disability rights
 
02:21:31.950 --> 02:21:31.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:21:34.230 --> 02:21:34.240 align:start position:0%
Hampshire thank you everyone I'm Karen
 
02:21:35.870 --> 02:21:35.880 align:start position:0%
Rosenberg I'm the policy director at the
 
02:21:39.030 --> 02:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
disability rights Center and um I have
 
02:21:41.270 --> 02:21:41.280 align:start position:0%
to say I'm coming to you extremely
 
02:21:43.830 --> 02:21:43.840 align:start position:0%
reluctantly in opposition to the spell I
 
02:21:46.950 --> 02:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
think it needs work I think there is
 
02:21:49.469 --> 02:21:49.479 align:start position:0%
we've a problem in this state we have a
 
02:21:52.710 --> 02:21:52.720 align:start position:0%
problem where students are being
 
02:21:54.550 --> 02:21:54.560 align:start position:0%
restrained and secluded in
 
02:21:57.469 --> 02:21:57.479 align:start position:0%
unconscionable numbers at unconscionable
 
02:22:01.270 --> 02:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
rates and video and audio recording
 
02:22:04.710 --> 02:22:04.720 align:start position:0%
would be tremendously helpful I mean it
 
02:22:07.670 --> 02:22:07.680 align:start position:0%
is a really good tool to be able to see
 
02:22:09.230 --> 02:22:09.240 align:start position:0%
the reality of what's happening I've
 
02:22:12.030 --> 02:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
been involved in investigating
 
02:22:14.429 --> 02:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
complaints of harm that has occurred
 
02:22:15.790 --> 02:22:15.800 align:start position:0%
during restraints and seclusion
 
02:22:17.670 --> 02:22:17.680 align:start position:0%
including at the cunu center
 
02:22:18.910 --> 02:22:18.920 align:start position:0%
and I'll tell you that in the most
 
02:22:21.110 --> 02:22:21.120 align:start position:0%
recent report we did which was pretty
 
02:22:23.030 --> 02:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
long time ago at this point it was the
 
02:22:25.990 --> 02:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
video recording even without sound that
 
02:22:28.190 --> 02:22:28.200 align:start position:0%
was really helpful in being able to
 
02:22:31.550 --> 02:22:31.560 align:start position:0%
determine what actually occurred um and
 
02:22:33.990 --> 02:22:34.000 align:start position:0%
to and to compare that with the report
 
02:22:36.510 --> 02:22:36.520 align:start position:0%
that was required under our state law
 
02:22:40.070 --> 02:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
was very very powerful this law this
 
02:22:43.150 --> 02:22:43.160 align:start position:0%
bill does not require recording it
 
02:22:45.830 --> 02:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't require anything that's already
 
02:22:47.790 --> 02:22:47.800 align:start position:0%
not that's already
 
02:22:49.710 --> 02:22:49.720 align:start position:0%
not required in our current law Federal
 
02:22:51.710 --> 02:22:51.720 align:start position:0%
Law requires schools to implement
 
02:22:53.790 --> 02:22:53.800 align:start position:0%
individualized education programs or
 
02:22:57.910 --> 02:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
IEPs that is the law so if an IEP
 
02:23:01.389 --> 02:23:01.399 align:start position:0%
provides for audio visual recording then
 
02:23:03.510 --> 02:23:03.520 align:start position:0%
that the school district must Implement
 
02:23:06.190 --> 02:23:06.200 align:start position:0%
that provision so this does not add to
 
02:23:08.870 --> 02:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
what's currently required the challenge
 
02:23:12.510 --> 02:23:12.520 align:start position:0%
for parents is that they are one member
 
02:23:16.190 --> 02:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
or the of the IEP team and when push
 
02:23:17.590 --> 02:23:17.600 align:start position:0%
comes to shove
 
02:23:20.070 --> 02:23:20.080 align:start position:0%
it is the school team members who will
 
02:23:22.670 --> 02:23:22.680 align:start position:0%
decide what the IEP team's decision is
 
02:23:24.710 --> 02:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
and if the parent doesn't agree with
 
02:23:27.150 --> 02:23:27.160 align:start position:0%
that then the parent May appeal that
 
02:23:29.950 --> 02:23:29.960 align:start position:0%
decision through a procedure called due
 
02:23:32.469 --> 02:23:32.479 align:start position:0%
process so the fact that a parent
 
02:23:34.469 --> 02:23:34.479 align:start position:0%
requests this does not guarantee that
 
02:23:36.630 --> 02:23:36.640 align:start position:0%
they will get a recording it could be
 
02:23:37.910 --> 02:23:37.920 align:start position:0%
something that they might get a lot of
 
02:23:41.230 --> 02:23:41.240 align:start position:0%
push back on another concern that our
 
02:23:43.870 --> 02:23:43.880 align:start position:0%
office has is that it's really important
 
02:23:47.790 --> 02:23:47.800 align:start position:0%
to keep in mind that that rest straint
 
02:23:49.910 --> 02:23:49.920 align:start position:0%
and seclusion these are emergency
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
interventions they should only be used
 
02:23:54.590 --> 02:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
when there is an imminent risk of
 
02:23:56.910 --> 02:23:56.920 align:start position:0%
substantial bodily harm in the case of
 
02:23:59.870 --> 02:23:59.880 align:start position:0%
restraint the idea that you could ever
 
02:24:02.030 --> 02:24:02.040 align:start position:0%
notify a parent before you restrain a
 
02:24:05.630 --> 02:24:05.640 align:start position:0%
kid it is is impossible because if you
 
02:24:08.550 --> 02:24:08.560 align:start position:0%
could do that then there is no emergency
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
and there is no need for restraint and
 
02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:12.920 align:start position:0%
we're very concerned that we don't we
 
02:24:15.870 --> 02:24:15.880 align:start position:0%
don't want to take any chance that the
 
02:24:17.990 --> 02:24:18.000 align:start position:0%
standard for restraint or seclusion this
 
02:24:20.150 --> 02:24:20.160 align:start position:0%
emergency standard getss watered down
 
02:24:23.389 --> 02:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
one minute to go I think another area
 
02:24:25.269 --> 02:24:25.279 align:start position:0%
where our current law may be lacking or
 
02:24:28.070 --> 02:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
at least enforcement is lacking is in
 
02:24:30.630 --> 02:24:30.640 align:start position:0%
oversight currently our restraint and
 
02:24:34.110 --> 02:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
seclusion law does require um school
 
02:24:37.590 --> 02:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
districts and and Facilities to document
 
02:24:39.389 --> 02:24:39.399 align:start position:0%
and provide a lot of documentation about
 
02:24:41.309 --> 02:24:41.319 align:start position:0%
what happens what leads to restraint all
 
02:24:42.389 --> 02:24:42.399 align:start position:0%
all kinds of things about the Restraint
 
02:24:43.990 --> 02:24:44.000 align:start position:0%
of seclusion and it's up to the
 
02:24:47.269 --> 02:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
Department of Education and DHHS to riew
 
02:24:49.389 --> 02:24:49.399 align:start position:0%
those records and oversee what's going
 
02:24:51.389 --> 02:24:51.399 align:start position:0%
on and oversee compliance yet they do
 
02:24:54.630 --> 02:24:54.640 align:start position:0%
nothing other than send a report to you
 
02:24:56.870 --> 02:24:56.880 align:start position:0%
all with the numbers of restraints the
 
02:24:58.590 --> 02:24:58.600 align:start position:0%
numbers of seclusions the schools that
 
02:24:59.870 --> 02:24:59.880 align:start position:0%
they occurred and whether there's
 
02:25:02.710 --> 02:25:02.720 align:start position:0%
complaints pending so this might be
 
02:25:04.830 --> 02:25:04.840 align:start position:0%
another area to take on so like I said
 
02:25:07.750 --> 02:25:07.760 align:start position:0%
there's a big problem here I just am not
 
02:25:09.510 --> 02:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
confident that this law really
 
02:25:11.950 --> 02:25:11.960 align:start position:0%
adequately addresses it thank you Miss

also we already we ALS we heard
 
02:25:42.950 --> 02:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
testimony that it's I believe it was 80%
 
02:25:45.269 --> 02:25:45.279 align:start position:0%
our special needs and I APS are you of
 
02:25:47.230 --> 02:25:47.240 align:start position:0%
that same opinion yeah I believe that
 
02:25:49.150 --> 02:25:49.160 align:start position:0%
that it's disproportionately students
 
02:25:51.389 --> 02:25:51.399 align:start position:0%
with disabilities who are subjected to
 
02:25:54.269 --> 02:25:54.279 align:start position:0%
these practices okay thank
 
02:25:57.110 --> 02:25:57.120 align:start position:0%

02:25:57.120 --> 02:26:00.110 align:start position:0%

02:26:00.110 --> 02:26:00.120 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
02:26:03.110 --> 02:26:03.120 align:start position:0%
what chair recognizes representative
 
02:26:05.910 --> 02:26:05.920 align:start position:0%
Bickford sorry sir thank you Mr chairman
 
02:26:08.630 --> 02:26:08.640 align:start position:0%
um so do you have a better
 
02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
plan well I think there were some
 
02:26:12.950 --> 02:26:12.960 align:start position:0%
suggestions made by members of this
 
02:26:16.550 --> 02:26:16.560 align:start position:0%
committee such as requiring audiovisual
 
02:26:18.950 --> 02:26:18.960 align:start position:0%
tap in in seclusion rooms or in
 
02:26:21.550 --> 02:26:21.560 align:start position:0%
contained classrooms I mean those are
 
02:26:23.550 --> 02:26:23.560 align:start position:0%
the places where children with the
 
02:26:25.110 --> 02:26:25.120 align:start position:0%
highest behavioral needs tend to be
 
02:26:27.429 --> 02:26:27.439 align:start position:0%
segregated I agree with Lisa Bodwin that
 
02:26:28.790 --> 02:26:28.800 align:start position:0%
this is wrong we shouldn't be
 
02:26:30.910 --> 02:26:30.920 align:start position:0%
segregating children with disabilities
 
02:26:33.790 --> 02:26:33.800 align:start position:0%
but right now they students with
 
02:26:35.990 --> 02:26:36.000 align:start position:0%
disabilities and students with extreme
 
02:26:38.469 --> 02:26:38.479 align:start position:0%
behavioral challenges are getting
 
02:26:41.190 --> 02:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
managed in segregated classrooms and in
 
02:26:42.870 --> 02:26:42.880 align:start position:0%
seclusion rooms and those would be
 
02:26:45.309 --> 02:26:45.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate places to have video cameras
 
02:26:47.510 --> 02:26:47.520 align:start position:0%
installed and not having be a question
 
02:26:49.110 --> 02:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
that parents have to fight through the
 
02:26:51.550 --> 02:26:51.560 align:start position:0%
whole IEP team
 
02:26:54.030 --> 02:26:54.040 align:start position:0%
process okay thank
 
02:26:59.550 --> 02:26:59.560 align:start position:0%

apologize for showing emotion thank you
 
03:26:22.070 --> 03:26:22.080 align:start position:0%
this is what we do wasn't expecting
 
03:26:26.910 --> 03:26:26.920 align:start position:0%
it um so I was trying to summarize um my
 
03:26:28.910 --> 03:26:28.920 align:start position:0%
husband ex-husband has continued to be
 
03:26:31.469 --> 03:26:31.479 align:start position:0%
abusive we've been divorced for going on
 
03:26:34.429 --> 03:26:34.439 align:start position:0%
eight years um but he uses time to
 
03:26:36.990 --> 03:26:37.000 align:start position:0%
communicate about children as um a means
 
03:26:40.870 --> 03:26:40.880 align:start position:0%
of harassment to denigrate me um it's
 
03:26:42.830 --> 03:26:42.840 align:start position:0%
been really cruel over the years I have
 
03:26:44.510 --> 03:26:44.520 align:start position:0%
done a quantitative analysis and a
 
03:26:46.870 --> 03:26:46.880 align:start position:0%
qualitative analysis of those messages
 
03:26:48.870 --> 03:26:48.880 align:start position:0%
for the courts to show the sheer amount
 
03:26:51.030 --> 03:26:51.040 align:start position:0%
of harassment and types of messages that
 
03:26:53.670 --> 03:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
come in um that has been pretty futi
 
03:26:56.150 --> 03:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
futile to get any kind of relief from
 
03:26:59.229 --> 03:26:59.239 align:start position:0%
any of that um this most recent attempt
 
03:27:02.309 --> 03:27:02.319 align:start position:0%
to uh take my children and my parenting
 
03:27:04.790 --> 03:27:04.800 align:start position:0%
time which I it is important to state
 
03:27:07.070 --> 03:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
that uh no judge has said that they
 
03:27:08.950 --> 03:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
should not return my children to me in
 
03:27:11.870 --> 03:27:11.880 align:start position:0%
this year and a half the court system
 
03:27:14.750 --> 03:27:14.760 align:start position:0%
the family court system is a really
 
03:27:17.510 --> 03:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
ineffective terrible place to
 
03:27:20.630 --> 03:27:20.640 align:start position:0%
be um as a summary some of the things
 
03:27:22.630 --> 03:27:22.640 align:start position:0%
that I had in here to tell you is in the
 
03:27:24.710 --> 03:27:24.720 align:start position:0%
past 24 months I have still no
 
03:27:26.790 --> 03:27:26.800 align:start position:0%
resolution about this
 
03:27:29.550 --> 03:27:29.560 align:start position:0%
situation because of delays G's not
 
03:27:31.510 --> 03:27:31.520 align:start position:0%
getting things in in time having
 
03:27:33.150 --> 03:27:33.160 align:start position:0%
different judges who contradict each
 
03:27:35.429 --> 03:27:35.439 align:start position:0%
other getting court dates cancelled and
 
03:27:36.870 --> 03:27:36.880 align:start position:0%
then when you when that happens in the
 
03:27:38.950 --> 03:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
family court system you get put to the
 
03:27:40.950 --> 03:27:40.960 align:start position:0%
bottom of the pile so if something gets
 
03:27:43.070 --> 03:27:43.080 align:start position:0%
canceled you get put down 3 to four
 
03:27:45.030 --> 03:27:45.040 align:start position:0%
months out so months and months and
 
03:27:47.150 --> 03:27:47.160 align:start position:0%
months are going by without time with my
 
03:27:49.710 --> 03:27:49.720 align:start position:0%
children because of some severe systemic
 
03:27:52.950 --> 03:27:52.960 align:start position:0%
failures this all trickles down to the
 
03:27:55.950 --> 03:27:55.960 align:start position:0%
emotional health obviously of myself my
 
03:27:59.670 --> 03:27:59.680 align:start position:0%
children my entire family um and also
 
03:28:02.550 --> 03:28:02.560 align:start position:0%
the Financial Health I have uh taken a
 
03:28:06.469 --> 03:28:06.479 align:start position:0%
second mortgage on my home um I have
 
03:28:08.710 --> 03:28:08.720 align:start position:0%
gone through savings um that's just in
 
03:28:10.229 --> 03:28:10.239 align:start position:0%
the past 24 months so that is not what
 
03:28:12.070 --> 03:28:12.080 align:start position:0%
I've spent in the course of in the past
 
03:28:15.469 --> 03:28:15.479 align:start position:0%
9 years lawyers are very very expensive
 
03:28:16.990 --> 03:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
and when you have a court system that
 
03:28:20.229 --> 03:28:20.239 align:start position:0%
cannot be effective and expeditious in
 
03:28:22.790 --> 03:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
getting decisions made for you that cost
 
03:28:27.030 --> 03:28:27.040 align:start position:0%
your constituents a ton of money I asked
 
03:28:29.030 --> 03:28:29.040 align:start position:0%
Karen if she could please summarize what
 
03:28:31.309 --> 03:28:31.319 align:start position:0%
she spent over her time fighting for her
 
03:28:33.830 --> 03:28:33.840 align:start position:0%
children she told me that she has spent
 
03:28:35.389 --> 03:28:35.399 align:start position:0%
60 she spent
 
03:28:37.630 --> 03:28:37.640 align:start position:0%
$60,000 she borrowed that money from her
 
03:28:39.750 --> 03:28:39.760 align:start position:0%
parents' retirement and she is working
 
03:28:42.150 --> 03:28:42.160 align:start position:0%
to pay that off right now
 
03:28:45.309 --> 03:28:45.319 align:start position:0%
um so severe Financial consequences when
 
03:28:47.790 --> 03:28:47.800 align:start position:0%
you have such severe systemic failures
 
03:28:49.469 --> 03:28:49.479 align:start position:0%
happening in your court system how do
 
03:28:51.950 --> 03:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
you believe that this bill will address
 
03:28:53.670 --> 03:28:53.680 align:start position:0%
that because that's what we're here for
 
03:28:56.910 --> 03:28:56.920 align:start position:0%
is this bill yeah so I mean of course I
 
03:28:58.469 --> 03:28:58.479 align:start position:0%
can see that there's the accountability
 
03:29:00.070 --> 03:29:00.080 align:start position:0%
of not returning your child which could
 
03:29:02.750 --> 03:29:02.760 align:start position:0%
be possibly $500 a day right every day
 
03:29:04.389 --> 03:29:04.399 align:start position:0%
it said on there that you don't return
 
03:29:06.670 --> 03:29:06.680 align:start position:0%
your child there needs to be some kind
 
03:29:10.150 --> 03:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
of way to um hold people accountable
 
03:29:11.750 --> 03:29:11.760 align:start position:0%
because he's been able to hold on to
 
03:29:14.349 --> 03:29:14.359 align:start position:0%
them without any consequence at this
 
03:29:16.590 --> 03:29:16.600 align:start position:0%
point so I think that that is vitally
 
03:29:19.670 --> 03:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
important I say to you that like I think
 
03:29:21.110 --> 03:29:21.120 align:start position:0%
part of the bill also talks about
 
03:29:23.269 --> 03:29:23.279 align:start position:0%
getting Financial reimbursement for your
 
03:29:26.870 --> 03:29:26.880 align:start position:0%
legal fees which I think is wonderful um
 
03:29:29.950 --> 03:29:29.960 align:start position:0%
I will say you know I have a master's
 
03:29:32.710 --> 03:29:32.720 align:start position:0%
degree I am I am midcareer and I have
 
03:29:35.630 --> 03:29:35.640 align:start position:0%
still struggled to pay for and navigate
 
03:29:38.590 --> 03:29:38.600 align:start position:0%
the family court systems so you can
 
03:29:40.790 --> 03:29:40.800 align:start position:0%
reimburse somebody but not everyone has
 
03:29:40.800 --> 03:29:41.910 align:start position:0%
reimburse somebody but not everyone has
the

03:29:41.910 --> 03:29:41.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:29:44.630 --> 03:29:44.640 align:start position:0%
$7,500 retainer that that lawyer is
 
03:29:48.590 --> 03:29:48.600 align:start position:0%
asking for to even get things started so
 
03:29:50.349 --> 03:29:50.359 align:start position:0%
I'm glad to see that there would be some
 
03:29:52.950 --> 03:29:52.960 align:start position:0%
reimbursement on the back end fear for
 
03:29:54.950 --> 03:29:54.960 align:start position:0%
the people that have less education or
 
03:29:57.630 --> 03:29:57.640 align:start position:0%
in a lower sces bracket than myself that
 
03:29:59.349 --> 03:29:59.359 align:start position:0%
are trying to navigate this system
 
03:30:04.229 --> 03:30:04.239 align:start position:0%
because I struggle with it in my
 
03:30:06.870 --> 03:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
position and do you wish uh cousin to
 
03:30:10.110 --> 03:30:10.120 align:start position:0%
speak as well um no she she's been
 
03:30:12.309 --> 03:30:12.319 align:start position:0%
pretty much doing all of that for me she
 
03:30:14.910 --> 03:30:14.920 align:start position:0%
get a lot in there and time allotted
 
03:30:17.910 --> 03:30:17.920 align:start position:0%
thank you any questions for and this is
 
03:30:21.830 --> 03:30:21.840 align:start position:0%
Meredith Costello any
 
03:30:21.840 --> 03:30:25.670 align:start position:0%
Meredith Costello any
questions

03:30:25.670 --> 03:30:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:28.070 --> 03:30:28.080 align:start position:0%
anybody I can tell you one thing that
 
03:30:31.189 --> 03:30:31.199 align:start position:0%
the legislature has done and that is we
 
03:30:35.269 --> 03:30:35.279 align:start position:0%
have in the budget that is now in effect
 
03:30:37.790 --> 03:30:37.800 align:start position:0%
we've got more Circuit Court judges some
 
03:30:39.830 --> 03:30:39.840 align:start position:0%
of which will go to Family Court and
 
03:30:42.349 --> 03:30:42.359 align:start position:0%
we've only just begun the study that
 
03:30:44.950 --> 03:30:44.960 align:start position:0%
looked at the needs indicated at least
 
03:30:47.309 --> 03:30:47.319 align:start position:0%
21 judges on the Circuit Court
 
03:30:49.870 --> 03:30:49.880 align:start position:0%
additionally uh this time we've got
 
03:30:52.469 --> 03:30:52.479 align:start position:0%
seven or actually six in the circuit and
 
03:30:55.590 --> 03:30:55.600 align:start position:0%
one on Superior and more are coming and
 
03:30:59.830 --> 03:30:59.840 align:start position:0%
that is one of the reasons for delay is
 
03:31:02.429 --> 03:31:02.439 align:start position:0%
not enough judges so that's being worked
 
03:31:06.229 --> 03:31:06.239 align:start position:0%
on and uh other things are in the back
 
03:31:08.349 --> 03:31:08.359 align:start position:0%
of the minds of some of us as well but
 
03:31:11.510 --> 03:31:11.520 align:start position:0%
we are cognizant of this okay
 
03:31:11.520 --> 03:31:13.469 align:start position:0%
we are cognizant of this okay
any

03:31:13.469 --> 03:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
any
 
03:31:15.590 --> 03:31:15.600 align:start position:0%
questions seeing
 
03:31:18.469 --> 03:31:18.479 align:start position:0%
none seeing none seeing
 
03:31:21.870 --> 03:31:21.880 align:start position:0%
one that is going to be yeah that's well
 
03:31:23.790 --> 03:31:23.800 align:start position:0%
that's overd doing too much here that's
 
03:31:25.950 --> 03:31:25.960 align:start position:0%
perfect okay thank you Mr now I remember
 
03:31:28.229 --> 03:31:28.239 align:start position:0%
your name is representative Raymond
 
03:31:29.510 --> 03:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thank you Miss
 
03:31:32.590 --> 03:31:32.600 align:start position:0%
Costello for coming to speak to us um so
 
03:31:35.830 --> 03:31:35.840 align:start position:0%
I noticed that you're in support of um
 
03:31:38.150 --> 03:31:38.160 align:start position:0%
the consequences for failing to comply
 
03:31:40.750 --> 03:31:40.760 align:start position:0%
with parenting orders I'm curious about
 
03:31:45.070 --> 03:31:45.080 align:start position:0%
how how um or how you feel about um the
 
03:31:46.910 --> 03:31:46.920 align:start position:0%
bill at the beginning of the bill it
 
03:31:49.590 --> 03:31:49.600 align:start position:0%
talks about um accept is otherwise
 
03:31:51.389 --> 03:31:51.399 align:start position:0%
precluded by state or
 
03:31:54.309 --> 03:31:54.319 align:start position:0%
law um if any individual professional
 
03:31:56.750 --> 03:31:56.760 align:start position:0%
public or private denies or fails access
 
03:32:00.590 --> 03:32:00.600 align:start position:0%
to Medical Dental Etc records to either
 
03:32:03.030 --> 03:32:03.040 align:start position:0%
parent should be held responsible I'm
 
03:32:05.309 --> 03:32:05.319 align:start position:0%
I'm curious about whether that part
 
03:32:08.550 --> 03:32:08.560 align:start position:0%
would impact your family situation like
 
03:32:11.229 --> 03:32:11.239 align:start position:0%
um if there are any barriers in your
 
03:32:14.110 --> 03:32:14.120 align:start position:0%
parenting plan to either one parent
 
03:32:16.269 --> 03:32:16.279 align:start position:0%
access accessing those records and if
 
03:32:19.469 --> 03:32:19.479 align:start position:0%
that would be um dangerous to have
 
03:32:21.429 --> 03:32:21.439 align:start position:0%
someone access it if they're not allowed
 
03:32:23.750 --> 03:32:23.760 align:start position:0%
to uh there's nothing in our parenting
 
03:32:25.910 --> 03:32:25.920 align:start position:0%
plan that says either of us can't access
 
03:32:28.030 --> 03:32:28.040 align:start position:0%
everything for our children so for me
 
03:32:29.990 --> 03:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
that isn't something that has been an
 
03:32:32.150 --> 03:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
issue thank
 
03:32:36.070 --> 03:32:36.080 align:start position:0%

03:34:54.870 --> 03:34:54.880 align:start position:0%
you the chair recognizes The Honorable
 
03:34:57.550 --> 03:34:57.560 align:start position:0%
Lisa post who has the distinction of
 
03:35:00.189 --> 03:35:00.199 align:start position:0%
being the prime sponsor of the bill and
 
03:35:02.349 --> 03:35:02.359 align:start position:0%
she was off doing some OS business
 
03:35:05.710 --> 03:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
weren't you just now and and uh your
 
03:35:08.110 --> 03:35:08.120 align:start position:0%
predecessors in the hot seat did a
 
03:35:13.510 --> 03:35:13.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:15.790 --> 03:35:15.800 align:start position:0%
and you can take the questions as to how
 
03:35:24.429 --> 03:35:24.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:27.590 --> 03:35:27.600 align:start position:0%
bill up I'm sorry for the record my name
 
03:35:30.630 --> 03:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
is Lisa post and I represent liboro
 
03:35:33.670 --> 03:35:33.680 align:start position:0%
Mount Vernon in New Boston
 
03:35:37.630 --> 03:35:37.640 align:start position:0%
um as it has already been introduced um
 
03:35:39.670 --> 03:35:39.680 align:start position:0%
should I just take some questions from
 
03:35:42.229 --> 03:35:42.239 align:start position:0%
folks or you can tell us what the what
 
03:35:44.710 --> 03:35:44.720 align:start position:0%
the big deal is and why it's important
 
03:35:47.750 --> 03:35:47.760 align:start position:0%
and what how this helps the uh State of
 
03:35:49.070 --> 03:35:49.080 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire do
 
03:35:52.510 --> 03:35:52.520 align:start position:0%
better so
 
03:35:54.590 --> 03:35:54.600 align:start position:0%
um I'm sure you've all seen the
 
03:35:57.990 --> 03:35:58.000 align:start position:0%
amendment so I will start with um from
 
03:36:00.389 --> 03:36:00.399 align:start position:0%
the beginning um this is very similar to
 
03:36:04.030 --> 03:36:04.040 align:start position:0%
a bill that was passed um through this
 
03:36:07.070 --> 03:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh committee but what this does it
 
03:36:09.429 --> 03:36:09.439 align:start position:0%
actually strengthens the bill that
 
03:36:12.189 --> 03:36:12.199 align:start position:0%
already went through so we're just here
 
03:36:16.189 --> 03:36:16.199 align:start position:0%
to fine-tune some things um so this bill
 
03:36:17.950 --> 03:36:17.960 align:start position:0%
provides that unless a parenting plan
 
03:36:19.750 --> 03:36:19.760 align:start position:0%
specifically provides otherwise both
 
03:36:21.790 --> 03:36:21.800 align:start position:0%
parents shall have access to all the
 
03:36:24.150 --> 03:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
records information that are pertaining
 
03:36:26.269 --> 03:36:26.279 align:start position:0%
to the child the bill further directs
 
03:36:28.349 --> 03:36:28.359 align:start position:0%
the court to award parental additional
 
03:36:31.269 --> 03:36:31.279 align:start position:0%
parenting parenting time in response to
 
03:36:33.110 --> 03:36:33.120 align:start position:0%
the other parents
 
03:36:34.990 --> 03:36:35.000 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with the parenting
 
03:36:37.469 --> 03:36:37.479 align:start position:0%
schedule this bill also permits the
 
03:36:39.030 --> 03:36:39.040 align:start position:0%
court to find a parent for
 
03:36:41.229 --> 03:36:41.239 align:start position:0%
non-compliance with either the
 
03:36:43.550 --> 03:36:43.560 align:start position:0%
obligation to share the records or to
 
03:36:46.590 --> 03:36:46.600 align:start position:0%
comply with the parenting schedule now
 
03:36:46.600 --> 03:36:47.510 align:start position:0%
comply with the parenting schedule now
with

03:36:47.510 --> 03:36:47.520 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:36:50.229 --> 03:36:50.239 align:start position:0%
that you've Pro probably heard a lot of
 
03:36:53.349 --> 03:36:53.359 align:start position:0%
testimony where the parent doesn't get
 
03:36:56.830 --> 03:36:56.840 align:start position:0%
the paperwork they have no way to
 
03:36:58.710 --> 03:36:58.720 align:start position:0%
understand what their child is going
 
03:37:00.910 --> 03:37:00.920 align:start position:0%
through and they don't have any
 
03:37:05.070 --> 03:37:05.080 align:start position:0%
information so this way um putting it in
 
03:37:08.110 --> 03:37:08.120 align:start position:0%
in statute will allow
 
03:37:11.110 --> 03:37:11.120 align:start position:0%
parents to have both
 
03:37:14.750 --> 03:37:14.760 align:start position:0%
access for medical records school
 
03:37:17.790 --> 03:37:17.800 align:start position:0%
records um unless of course there is a
 
03:37:22.990 --> 03:37:23.000 align:start position:0%
reason not to and that is not a part of
 
03:37:26.150 --> 03:37:26.160 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't apply to people who have
 
03:37:29.429 --> 03:37:29.439 align:start position:0%
already been um I don't want to say
 
03:37:37.110 --> 03:37:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:42.110 --> 03:37:42.120 align:start position:0%
um so sorry um that that are not abusers
 
03:37:45.030 --> 03:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
or neglect or anything like that so
 
03:37:48.630 --> 03:37:48.640 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at those um folks
 
03:37:51.670 --> 03:37:51.680 align:start position:0%
that are trying to put together a
 
03:37:55.950 --> 03:37:55.960 align:start position:0%
parenting plan that works for both
 
03:38:00.550 --> 03:38:00.560 align:start position:0%
families um and the other part of this
 
03:38:04.590 --> 03:38:04.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:10.870 --> 03:38:10.880 align:start position:0%
um the ability for uh families to um
 
03:38:13.870 --> 03:38:13.880 align:start position:0%
um have a parenting
 
03:38:18.189 --> 03:38:18.199 align:start position:0%
schedule that um keeps the child in
 
03:38:21.630 --> 03:38:21.640 align:start position:0%
touch with both parents equally and if
 
03:38:24.550 --> 03:38:24.560 align:start position:0%
there's any time that a
 
03:38:29.550 --> 03:38:29.560 align:start position:0%
parent creates a problem that causes um
 
03:38:32.550 --> 03:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
the family to now be split and one
 
03:38:35.349 --> 03:38:35.359 align:start position:0%
parent um wants to keep the child longer
 
03:38:39.710 --> 03:38:39.720 align:start position:0%
than the other person um that they have
 
03:38:39.720 --> 03:38:40.830 align:start position:0%
than the other person um that they have
to

03:38:40.830 --> 03:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:38:43.830 --> 03:38:43.840 align:start position:0%
um comply with the law if they're not
 
03:38:45.670 --> 03:38:45.680 align:start position:0%
doing anything wrong they should have
 
03:38:48.469 --> 03:38:48.479 align:start position:0%
that same if the parent keeps that child
 
03:38:51.269 --> 03:38:51.279 align:start position:0%
they have the same amount of time given
 
03:38:54.750 --> 03:38:54.760 align:start position:0%
back to the person that was egged by not
 
03:38:58.790 --> 03:38:58.800 align:start position:0%
having time with their child and as we
 
03:39:01.429 --> 03:39:01.439 align:start position:0%
know and we've seen this a lot of times
 
03:39:05.910 --> 03:39:05.920 align:start position:0%
when you've gone through um these
 
03:39:08.469 --> 03:39:08.479 align:start position:0%
situations with people coming up and
 
03:39:10.790 --> 03:39:10.800 align:start position:0%
testifying and talking about
 
03:39:13.870 --> 03:39:13.880 align:start position:0%
how awful it is not to be able to see
 
03:39:16.309 --> 03:39:16.319 align:start position:0%
your child not to be able to know what
 
03:39:19.070 --> 03:39:19.080 align:start position:0%
your child is doing how he's doing in
 
03:39:23.110 --> 03:39:23.120 align:start position:0%
school what his metal conditions are so
 
03:39:25.349 --> 03:39:25.359 align:start position:0%
I am totally in support of this bill
 
03:39:29.750 --> 03:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
because it's strengthens families the
 
03:39:32.950 --> 03:39:32.960 align:start position:0%
parent child relationship it strengthens
 
03:39:38.189 --> 03:39:38.199 align:start position:0%
and again it also when both
 
03:39:40.910 --> 03:39:40.920 align:start position:0%
parties can get together and and allow
 
03:39:43.750 --> 03:39:43.760 align:start position:0%
that child to get to know their
 
03:39:46.790 --> 03:39:46.800 align:start position:0%
grandparents their aunts their uncles
 
03:39:48.269 --> 03:39:48.279 align:start position:0%
and their
 
03:39:50.630 --> 03:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
cousins and that keeps a family unit
 
03:39:53.710 --> 03:39:53.720 align:start position:0%
that keeps the child healthy that helps
 
03:39:56.030 --> 03:39:56.040 align:start position:0%
um any kind of mental instability that
 
03:39:58.910 --> 03:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
child has by being torn apart and not
 
03:40:01.349 --> 03:40:01.359 align:start position:0%
being allowed to see the other parent
 
03:40:06.750 --> 03:40:06.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:10.710 --> 03:40:10.720 align:start position:0%
time so yeah there's a question any
 
03:40:13.670 --> 03:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
questions for the sponsor this is your
 
03:40:16.229 --> 03:40:16.239 align:start position:0%
chance representative Panic you have a
 
03:40:18.550 --> 03:40:18.560 align:start position:0%
great question chairman
 
03:40:20.630 --> 03:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
uh thank you
 
03:40:22.710 --> 03:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
representative for letting me ask you
 
03:40:26.389 --> 03:40:26.399 align:start position:0%
this question I don't understand on um
 
03:40:30.309 --> 03:40:30.319 align:start position:0%
page one line 29 under C where it says
 
03:40:34.229 --> 03:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
shall occur on or before the second
 
03:40:37.229 --> 03:40:37.239 align:start position:0%
anniversary of the date of the Court
 
03:40:40.389 --> 03:40:40.399 align:start position:0%
finds the parent in contempt for non
 
03:40:42.269 --> 03:40:42.279 align:start position:0%
compliance with the court ordered
 
03:40:44.790 --> 03:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
parenting schedule why was second
 
03:40:47.750 --> 03:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
anniversary chosen because sometimes it
 
03:40:51.229 --> 03:40:51.239 align:start position:0%
takes the Court's uh while to um be able
 
03:40:53.150 --> 03:40:53.160 align:start position:0%
to make those
 
03:40:56.070 --> 03:40:56.080 align:start position:0%
determinations okay thank you
 
03:40:58.630 --> 03:40:58.640 align:start position:0%
representative Greg thank you Mr
 
03:41:00.710 --> 03:41:00.720 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for being here to
 
03:41:03.630 --> 03:41:03.640 align:start position:0%
um and taking my question so you know we
 
03:41:06.550 --> 03:41:06.560 align:start position:0%
did pass the bill um well through the
 
03:41:08.189 --> 03:41:08.199 align:start position:0%
committee anyway last week and stuff
 
03:41:11.429 --> 03:41:11.439 align:start position:0%
that even has like a fine and whatnot my
 
03:41:13.710 --> 03:41:13.720 align:start position:0%
concern and my question is that when we
 
03:41:16.910 --> 03:41:16.920 align:start position:0%
talk about you
 
03:41:20.830 --> 03:41:20.840 align:start position:0%
know uh there's a question but if we if
 
03:41:22.670 --> 03:41:22.680 align:start position:0%
we talk about the child who's been kept
 
03:41:25.030 --> 03:41:25.040 align:start position:0%
from one parent and for a particular
 
03:41:26.510 --> 03:41:26.520 align:start position:0%
amount of time and sometimes it can be
 
03:41:28.910 --> 03:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
years which is incredibly unfortunate
 
03:41:32.510 --> 03:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
and not okay but then we want that child
 
03:41:33.830 --> 03:41:33.840 align:start position:0%
to go back with the other parent there's
 
03:41:35.710 --> 03:41:35.720 align:start position:0%
even talk of maybe having to do some
 
03:41:38.510 --> 03:41:38.520 align:start position:0%
kind of therapy or something to reunify
 
03:41:41.389 --> 03:41:41.399 align:start position:0%
them now if we say okay you've been
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
without parent a for three years so now
 
03:41:46.269 --> 03:41:46.279 align:start position:0%
you're going to go with parent B for the
 
03:41:48.309 --> 03:41:48.319 align:start position:0%
same for three year or you've been
 
03:41:49.469 --> 03:41:49.479 align:start position:0%
whichever you're going with that other
 
03:41:51.590 --> 03:41:51.600 align:start position:0%
parent for another three years does this
 
03:41:55.309 --> 03:41:55.319 align:start position:0%
not make the child more of a a pawn as
 
03:41:58.149 --> 03:41:58.159 align:start position:0%
well as do more damage by saying that
 
03:41:59.910 --> 03:41:59.920 align:start position:0%
we're going to give them back the time
 
03:42:01.590 --> 03:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
that they've lost I feel like that's
 
03:42:03.710 --> 03:42:03.720 align:start position:0%
maybe in the best interest of the parent
 
03:42:05.630 --> 03:42:05.640 align:start position:0%
but not necessarily the
 
03:42:09.189 --> 03:42:09.199 align:start position:0%
child okay so um with that I I
 
03:42:11.590 --> 03:42:11.600 align:start position:0%
understand what you're saying but the
 
03:42:13.710 --> 03:42:13.720 align:start position:0%
the fact of the matter is when a child
 
03:42:17.710 --> 03:42:17.720 align:start position:0%
is ripped away from one of their parents
 
03:42:18.670 --> 03:42:18.680 align:start position:0%
it's an
 
03:42:21.870 --> 03:42:21.880 align:start position:0%
emotional um devastating situation for
 
03:42:27.189 --> 03:42:27.199 align:start position:0%
that child however if they already have
 
03:42:28.910 --> 03:42:28.920 align:start position:0%
we're looking at someone who's already
 
03:42:31.389 --> 03:42:31.399 align:start position:0%
having a par a parental plan right to
 
03:42:33.990 --> 03:42:34.000 align:start position:0%
work together and just one day out of
 
03:42:35.910 --> 03:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
the blue they decide to keep the child
 
03:42:37.790 --> 03:42:37.800 align:start position:0%
for extra time or whatever because
 
03:42:40.389 --> 03:42:40.399 align:start position:0%
something has happened they have agreed
 
03:42:44.790 --> 03:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
with one another um that
 
03:42:48.630 --> 03:42:48.640 align:start position:0%
child suffers more by not seeing one
 
03:42:52.110 --> 03:42:52.120 align:start position:0%
parent than the other so regardless of
 
03:42:54.590 --> 03:42:54.600 align:start position:0%
timing children can make that up with
 
03:42:56.870 --> 03:42:56.880 align:start position:0%
their parents by spending time with them
 
03:43:01.630 --> 03:43:01.640 align:start position:0%
whether it's a year a week two years
 
03:43:04.349 --> 03:43:04.359 align:start position:0%
that child needs its parent and needs to
 
03:43:07.469 --> 03:43:07.479 align:start position:0%
know all the things that
 
03:43:11.790 --> 03:43:11.800 align:start position:0%
um that their parent loves them just as
 
03:43:14.469 --> 03:43:14.479 align:start position:0%
much as the other parent loves them and
 
03:43:18.469 --> 03:43:18.479 align:start position:0%
it gives the family more stability when
 
03:43:22.349 --> 03:43:22.359 align:start position:0%
they have to work together and generally
 
03:43:25.349 --> 03:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
I would say people that have to go
 
03:43:28.110 --> 03:43:28.120 align:start position:0%
through something like this and are
 
03:43:33.950 --> 03:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
forced forced by the courts to um work
 
03:43:35.750 --> 03:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
with each
 
03:43:40.349 --> 03:43:40.359 align:start position:0%
other that makes them comply more and it
 
03:43:42.590 --> 03:43:42.600 align:start position:0%
makes it easier for families and I I
 
03:43:44.990 --> 03:43:45.000 align:start position:0%
believe we've heard this before in
 
03:43:49.149 --> 03:43:49.159 align:start position:0%
testimony that that parents um kids do
 
03:43:50.469 --> 03:43:50.479 align:start position:0%
better when both
 
03:43:55.389 --> 03:43:55.399 align:start position:0%
parents are with them follow up so and
 
03:43:57.189 --> 03:43:57.199 align:start position:0%
on that note wouldn't it be better to
 
03:43:58.990 --> 03:43:59.000 align:start position:0%
instead of saying okay you've been away
 
03:44:00.630 --> 03:44:00.640 align:start position:0%
from this parent for a year let's give
 
03:44:01.950 --> 03:44:01.960 align:start position:0%
you to that parent for a year wouldn't
 
03:44:04.149 --> 03:44:04.159 align:start position:0%
it be better to reestablish the
 
03:44:06.990 --> 03:44:07.000 align:start position:0%
relationship or that parenting plan as
 
03:44:08.910 --> 03:44:08.920 align:start position:0%
is so that they have meaningful time
 
03:44:10.469 --> 03:44:10.479 align:start position:0%
with both of them immediately rather
 
03:44:12.790 --> 03:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
than doing it back and forth so we don't
 
03:44:14.790 --> 03:44:14.800 align:start position:0%
Define that in any way in this bill so
 
03:44:16.990 --> 03:44:17.000 align:start position:0%
it's something that they are to work
 
03:44:19.550 --> 03:44:19.560 align:start position:0%
together to figure out what that timing
 
03:44:23.070 --> 03:44:23.080 align:start position:0%
is going to be there's nothing in here
 
03:44:26.510 --> 03:44:26.520 align:start position:0%
that specifically states that that
 
03:44:30.269 --> 03:44:30.279 align:start position:0%
parent has to have them at in one whole
 
03:44:33.429 --> 03:44:33.439 align:start position:0%
ve swoop they can do it over time to
 
03:44:36.110 --> 03:44:36.120 align:start position:0%
make up that
 
03:44:38.750 --> 03:44:38.760 align:start position:0%
time representative D
 
03:44:38.760 --> 03:44:42.309 align:start position:0%
time representative D
Simon

03:44:42.309 --> 03:44:42.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman asked and
 
03:44:47.149 --> 03:44:47.159 align:start position:0%
answered representative
 
03:44:49.189 --> 03:44:49.199 align:start position:0%
Raymond thank you Mr chairman and thank
 
03:44:51.710 --> 03:44:51.720 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question um I have two
 
03:44:54.389 --> 03:44:54.399 align:start position:0%
questions about um language in the Bell
 
03:44:57.229 --> 03:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
and the the first one is on um line
 
03:45:00.149 --> 03:45:00.159 align:start position:0%
seven which is um number two it says
 
03:45:01.990 --> 03:45:02.000 align:start position:0%
accept as otherwise precluded by state
 
03:45:05.110 --> 03:45:05.120 align:start position:0%
or federal law and then it talks about
 
03:45:07.429 --> 03:45:07.439 align:start position:0%
um institutions and organizations being
 
03:45:11.309 --> 03:45:11.319 align:start position:0%
required to provide records my question
 
03:45:16.070 --> 03:45:16.080 align:start position:0%
is without if we don't list or parenting
 
03:45:20.510 --> 03:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
plan in that sentence does section two
 
03:45:24.710 --> 03:45:24.720 align:start position:0%
override the parenting pl's um rules
 
03:45:27.510 --> 03:45:27.520 align:start position:0%
about who has access to records because
 
03:45:28.830 --> 03:45:28.840 align:start position:0%
we know that the parenting plans
 
03:45:30.990 --> 03:45:31.000 align:start position:0%
sometimes say listen this parent can
 
03:45:32.750 --> 03:45:32.760 align:start position:0%
have all the records but this parent
 
03:45:34.189 --> 03:45:34.199 align:start position:0%
can't have the therapist records because
 
03:45:36.030 --> 03:45:36.040 align:start position:0%
it would be damaging to the child but
 
03:45:37.630 --> 03:45:37.640 align:start position:0%
now we have section two saying to the
 
03:45:39.670 --> 03:45:39.680 align:start position:0%
therapist you must give them that record
 
03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
record unless state law says you can't
 
03:45:43.950 --> 03:45:43.960 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm questioning whether there's
 
03:45:47.189 --> 03:45:47.199 align:start position:0%
an internal um discrepancy without
 
03:45:49.110 --> 03:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
having parenting plan be one of the
 
03:45:51.870 --> 03:45:51.880 align:start position:0%
reasons why a therapist or a doctor or
 
03:45:54.790 --> 03:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
whatever wouldn't release the records so
 
03:45:57.670 --> 03:45:57.680 align:start position:0%
I think that was purposely let uh left
 
03:46:03.990 --> 03:46:04.000 align:start position:0%
out that that is not an obligation there
 
03:46:08.750 --> 03:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
um when we Define every little thing
 
03:46:11.670 --> 03:46:11.680 align:start position:0%
whether a doctor or a therapist or a
 
03:46:14.830 --> 03:46:14.840 align:start position:0%
teacher or a counselor if we're telling
 
03:46:17.349 --> 03:46:17.359 align:start position:0%
them every little thing they can't or
 
03:46:17.359 --> 03:46:18.429 align:start position:0%
them every little thing they can't or
can

03:46:18.429 --> 03:46:18.439 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:46:22.070 --> 03:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
have is not is not really an issue
 
03:46:24.590 --> 03:46:24.600 align:start position:0%
because we are only looking at folks
 
03:46:26.590 --> 03:46:26.600 align:start position:0%
that are working together families that
 
03:46:28.830 --> 03:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
are working together right with a
 
03:46:33.070 --> 03:46:33.080 align:start position:0%
parenting plan which they make up right
 
03:46:35.309 --> 03:46:35.319 align:start position:0%
their parenting plan with this they have
 
03:46:37.790 --> 03:46:37.800 align:start position:0%
the ability to say because this is only
 
03:46:40.429 --> 03:46:40.439 align:start position:0%
when this happens this this is only when
 
03:46:43.030 --> 03:46:43.040 align:start position:0%
a parent has been agged by not having
 
03:46:48.030 --> 03:46:48.040 align:start position:0%
the child right so so follow up to that
 
03:46:48.040 --> 03:46:50.349 align:start position:0%
the child right so so follow up to that
okay

03:46:50.349 --> 03:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:46:52.670 --> 03:46:52.680 align:start position:0%
follow I'll follow up set please thank
 
03:46:58.070 --> 03:46:58.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:01.750 --> 03:47:01.760 align:start position:0%
so the the the this section section
 
03:47:05.269 --> 03:47:05.279 align:start position:0%
starting on on line S doesn't say you
 
03:47:06.830 --> 03:47:06.840 align:start position:0%
only have access to your child's medical
 
03:47:08.670 --> 03:47:08.680 align:start position:0%
records if the other person has withhold
 
03:47:10.630 --> 03:47:10.640 align:start position:0%
your withheld your parenting plan or if
 
03:47:12.590 --> 03:47:12.600 align:start position:0%
you're not in compliance it says you
 
03:47:16.349 --> 03:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
have access and we're going to cause a a
 
03:47:18.070 --> 03:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
consequence to institutions who don't
 
03:47:19.790 --> 03:47:19.800 align:start position:0%
give you the records irregardless of
 
03:47:22.790 --> 03:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
what your parenting plan says right
 
03:47:25.550 --> 03:47:25.560 align:start position:0%
correct okay correct so and Mr chairman
 
03:47:27.110 --> 03:47:27.120 align:start position:0%
if I could ask my second question you
 
03:47:31.389 --> 03:47:31.399 align:start position:0%
may thank you on page two line two um it
 
03:47:33.070 --> 03:47:33.080 align:start position:0%
says the court May impose a civil fine
 
03:47:35.309 --> 03:47:35.319 align:start position:0%
of $500 for non-compliance where does
 
03:47:37.790 --> 03:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
that go is that a fine to the court is
 
03:47:40.670 --> 03:47:40.680 align:start position:0%
that a fine to the parent who is the
 
03:47:40.680 --> 03:47:44.229 align:start position:0%
that a fine to the parent who is the
agreed

03:47:44.229 --> 03:47:44.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:47.750 --> 03:47:47.760 align:start position:0%
party I actually do not know the answer
 
03:47:51.229 --> 03:47:51.239 align:start position:0%
to that I would believe that it went to
 
03:47:51.239 --> 03:47:53.149 align:start position:0%
to that I would believe that it went to
the

03:47:53.149 --> 03:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:47:58.309 --> 03:47:58.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:01.750 --> 03:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
you representative Perez thank you Mr
 
03:48:03.030 --> 03:48:03.040 align:start position:0%
chairman for allowing me to ask the
 
03:48:04.590 --> 03:48:04.600 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
03:48:08.510 --> 03:48:08.520 align:start position:0%
question don't we already have parental
 
03:48:12.750 --> 03:48:12.760 align:start position:0%
rights to have access to records and the
 
03:48:14.750 --> 03:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
only time the parents don't have access
 
03:48:17.229 --> 03:48:17.239 align:start position:0%
to these records is when someone is
 
03:48:20.670 --> 03:48:20.680 align:start position:0%
accused of neglected or uh domestic
 
03:48:23.510 --> 03:48:23.520 align:start position:0%
violence or child abuse may I ask that
 
03:48:25.830 --> 03:48:25.840 align:start position:0%
question thank you yeah uh thank you for
 
03:48:28.990 --> 03:48:29.000 align:start position:0%
that question so this is not for people
 
03:48:31.510 --> 03:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
who are abusers right this is for people
 
03:48:35.030 --> 03:48:35.040 align:start position:0%
that are working together uh it we
 
03:48:40.149 --> 03:48:40.159 align:start position:0%
already have a an ability to
 
03:48:45.149 --> 03:48:45.159 align:start position:0%
um have someone that has been an abuser
 
03:48:48.429 --> 03:48:48.439 align:start position:0%
that they are no longer allowed to
 
03:48:51.550 --> 03:48:51.560 align:start position:0%
participate in those kinds of things
 
03:48:53.229 --> 03:48:53.239 align:start position:0%
whether they can't get their school
 
03:48:56.550 --> 03:48:56.560 align:start position:0%
records or their their medical records
 
03:49:00.189 --> 03:49:00.199 align:start position:0%
that is already a a separate issue from
 
03:49:04.189 --> 03:49:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:07.750 --> 03:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
here followup thank you
 
03:49:11.790 --> 03:49:11.800 align:start position:0%
followup so you told me that this is
 
03:49:13.550 --> 03:49:13.560 align:start position:0%
completely separate from the rights the
 
03:49:15.950 --> 03:49:15.960 align:start position:0%
parents already
 
03:49:20.030 --> 03:49:20.040 align:start position:0%
have so many times a parent whe when
 
03:49:22.630 --> 03:49:22.640 align:start position:0%
they have a parenting plan and they're
 
03:49:24.950 --> 03:49:24.960 align:start position:0%
trying to work together and one person
 
03:49:27.710 --> 03:49:27.720 align:start position:0%
gets mad at the other and they have a
 
03:49:29.750 --> 03:49:29.760 align:start position:0%
relationship maybe one of the family
 
03:49:32.349 --> 03:49:32.359 align:start position:0%
members the the mother or the father
 
03:49:37.309 --> 03:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
grandmother whatever um if that person
 
03:49:40.469 --> 03:49:40.479 align:start position:0%
um feels like that
 
03:49:43.349 --> 03:49:43.359 align:start position:0%
the other person is not doing what they
 
03:49:45.349 --> 03:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
want them to do or they're upset with
 
03:49:49.590 --> 03:49:49.600 align:start position:0%
them in some way they can go and and uh
 
03:49:51.990 --> 03:49:52.000 align:start position:0%
say I don't want you know my child's
 
03:49:54.670 --> 03:49:54.680 align:start position:0%
record shared with this person the
 
03:49:56.790 --> 03:49:56.800 align:start position:0%
husband the grandmother Whoever has the
 
03:50:01.950 --> 03:50:01.960 align:start position:0%
child and how that works um and and they
 
03:50:04.070 --> 03:50:04.080 align:start position:0%
will the schools will do that for these
 
03:50:06.870 --> 03:50:06.880 align:start position:0%
folks and then the other one who there's
 
03:50:10.590 --> 03:50:10.600 align:start position:0%
been nothing um uh uh that person has
 
03:50:16.429 --> 03:50:16.439 align:start position:0%
not had uh been uh denied access to that
 
03:50:20.469 --> 03:50:20.479 align:start position:0%
child that person still has the ability
 
03:50:22.950 --> 03:50:22.960 align:start position:0%
to get it but the schools won't give
 
03:50:25.030 --> 03:50:25.040 align:start position:0%
them or the doctor won't give them
 
03:50:27.070 --> 03:50:27.080 align:start position:0%
because the mother or the
 
03:50:30.229 --> 03:50:30.239 align:start position:0%
father are are saying nasty things about
 
03:50:32.389 --> 03:50:32.399 align:start position:0%
each other so I believe that happens
 
03:50:34.349 --> 03:50:34.359 align:start position:0%
quite a bit follow
 
03:50:39.550 --> 03:50:39.560 align:start position:0%
up um so with this bill as schools can
 
03:50:42.349 --> 03:50:42.359 align:start position:0%
be punished to pay penalties or anyone
 
03:50:44.710 --> 03:50:44.720 align:start position:0%
who doesn't give the records to the
 
03:50:46.830 --> 03:50:46.840 align:start position:0%
parent no I don't believe there's
 
03:50:50.389 --> 03:50:50.399 align:start position:0%
penalties on that it is this is a way to
 
03:50:55.910 --> 03:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
um it says shall right and not May and
 
03:51:00.189 --> 03:51:00.199 align:start position:0%
that with that language it strengthens
 
03:51:07.710 --> 03:51:07.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:09.950 --> 03:51:09.960 align:start position:0%
comply represent
 
03:51:12.750 --> 03:51:12.760 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
03:51:15.790 --> 03:51:15.800 align:start position:0%
for being here with us take my question

um I I am looking at this and tell me if
 
03:51:20.149 --> 03:51:20.159 align:start position:0%
I'm right or wrong as kind of an
 
03:51:24.070 --> 03:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
intermediate thing between is it 633
 
03:51:26.550 --> 03:51:26.560 align:start position:0%
that's a criminal uh for interference
 
03:51:28.309 --> 03:51:28.319 align:start position:0%
with custody which I heard the
 
03:51:30.429 --> 03:51:30.439 align:start position:0%
discussion go on about somebody takes a
 
03:51:32.550 --> 03:51:32.560 align:start position:0%
child for three years naturally the
 
03:51:34.550 --> 03:51:34.560 align:start position:0%
other parent would report it to the
 
03:51:37.110 --> 03:51:37.120 align:start position:0%
police and sometimes the police do
 
03:51:38.710 --> 03:51:38.720 align:start position:0%
something about it I've heard a lot of
 
03:51:40.830 --> 03:51:40.840 align:start position:0%
times they don't don't but anyway that's
 
03:51:43.510 --> 03:51:43.520 align:start position:0%
under the criminal code whereas this is
 
03:51:46.149 --> 03:51:46.159 align:start position:0%
civil and would be much I would say
 
03:51:49.070 --> 03:51:49.080 align:start position:0%
softer you know like a first step so I
 
03:51:50.990 --> 03:51:51.000 align:start position:0%
wouldn't expect this to be the long-term
 
03:51:53.149 --> 03:51:53.159 align:start position:0%
interference but more of a shortterm
 
03:51:55.389 --> 03:51:55.399 align:start position:0%
wouldn't it be excuse we're making this
 
03:52:00.550 --> 03:52:00.560 align:start position:0%
a question so wouldn't it be okay thank
 
03:52:04.469 --> 03:52:04.479 align:start position:0%
you he has a good point it should be
 
03:52:04.479 --> 03:52:08.070 align:start position:0%
you he has a good point it should be
okay

03:52:08.070 --> 03:52:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:08.080 --> 03:52:10.670 align:start position:0%
 
good

03:52:10.670 --> 03:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
good
 
03:52:13.110 --> 03:52:13.120 align:start position:0%
anyone else with a question for the
 
03:52:16.429 --> 03:52:16.439 align:start position:0%
prime sponsor saying none thank you so
 
03:52:18.990 --> 03:52:19.000 align:start position:0%
much will we address the amendment at
 
03:52:21.469 --> 03:52:21.479 align:start position:0%
all yes in the exec session okay
 
03:52:24.710 --> 03:52:24.720 align:start position:0%
meanwhile we can all read it furtively
 
03:52:28.229 --> 03:52:28.239 align:start position:0%
on our own thank you're
 
03:52:31.389 --> 03:52:31.399 align:start position:0%
welcome chair recognizes one of our
 
03:52:34.309 --> 03:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
frequent flyers uh Mr Dana
 
03:52:37.550 --> 03:52:37.560 align:start position:0%
albre and um you said you're going to
 
03:52:40.750 --> 03:52:40.760 align:start position:0%
speak in three minutes but you have
 
03:52:50.389 --> 03:52:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:53.990 --> 03:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
tantalizing wow you always come with so
 
03:52:56.910 --> 03:52:56.920 align:start position:0%
much useful information you know
 
03:53:03.590 --> 03:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:53:07.229 --> 03:53:07.239 align:start position:0%
chair so uh what's being passed around
 
03:53:10.030 --> 03:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
now is uh two
 
03:53:13.950 --> 03:53:13.960 align:start position:0%
exhibits uh which are very brief uh so
 
03:53:16.110 --> 03:53:16.120 align:start position:0%
it's my hope you actually have time to
 
03:53:19.389 --> 03:53:19.399 align:start position:0%
look at those uh which I believe speak
 
03:53:22.670 --> 03:53:22.680 align:start position:0%
to the sort of two separate pieces of
 
03:53:27.389 --> 03:53:27.399 align:start position:0%
the bill so the first is a simple
 
03:53:31.149 --> 03:53:31.159 align:start position:0%
one-page uh police report uh with some
 
03:53:33.309 --> 03:53:33.319 align:start position:0%
redactions as
 
03:53:35.950 --> 03:53:35.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate uh that speaks for the need
 
03:53:37.750 --> 03:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
for timely
 
03:53:40.710 --> 03:53:40.720 align:start position:0%
resolution uh uh of a Judicial
 
03:53:45.269 --> 03:53:45.279 align:start position:0%
enforcement of parenting plan under RSA
 
03:53:47.670 --> 03:53:47.680 align:start position:0%
461 uh
 
03:53:52.189 --> 03:53:52.199 align:start position:0%
a4a uh which this uh Bill seeks to amend
 
03:53:56.349 --> 03:53:56.359 align:start position:0%
uh as well as uh I believe House Bill
 
03:53:59.149 --> 03:53:59.159 align:start position:0%
106 uh and the second
 
03:54:03.149 --> 03:54:03.159 align:start position:0%
one uh is an email exchange with some
 
03:54:05.269 --> 03:54:05.279 align:start position:0%
schools counselors and
 
03:54:09.269 --> 03:54:09.279 align:start position:0%
providers uh also appropriately redacted
 
03:54:12.309 --> 03:54:12.319 align:start position:0%
to speak to the other part of this bill
 
03:54:15.590 --> 03:54:15.600 align:start position:0%
or the need for it on
 
03:54:17.630 --> 03:54:17.640 align:start position:0%
records uh
 
03:54:22.670 --> 03:54:22.680 align:start position:0%
so let me Begin by saying that uh rights
 
03:54:27.429 --> 03:54:27.439 align:start position:0%
on paper that can't be enforced are
 
03:54:27.439 --> 03:54:29.349 align:start position:0%
on paper that can't be enforced are
pretty

03:54:29.349 --> 03:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
pretty
 
03:54:29.359 --> 03:54:31.830 align:start position:0%
pretty
useless

03:54:31.830 --> 03:54:31.840 align:start position:0%
useless
 
03:54:36.229 --> 03:54:36.239 align:start position:0%
and as it stands right now the New
 
03:54:39.990 --> 03:54:40.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state supreme court has
 
03:54:43.950 --> 03:54:43.960 align:start position:0%
construed RSA 461
 
03:54:50.110 --> 03:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
a4a as it is currently in statute is uh
 
03:54:52.349 --> 03:54:52.359 align:start position:0%
not requiring much of
 
03:54:57.429 --> 03:54:57.439 align:start position:0%
anything they've uh said we can go years
 
03:54:58.830 --> 03:54:58.840 align:start position:0%
without holding a
 
03:55:02.389 --> 03:55:02.399 align:start position:0%
hearing uh on a request for enforcement
 
03:55:05.910 --> 03:55:05.920 align:start position:0%
and that's just fine with
 
03:55:05.920 --> 03:55:07.790 align:start position:0%
and that's just fine with
them

03:55:07.790 --> 03:55:07.800 align:start position:0%
them
 
03:55:07.800 --> 03:55:10.429 align:start position:0%
them
uh

03:55:10.429 --> 03:55:10.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:55:13.590 --> 03:55:13.600 align:start position:0%
and uh so if you have a look at
 
03:55:18.590 --> 03:55:18.600 align:start position:0%
the uh police report the issue with that
 
03:55:22.229 --> 03:55:22.239 align:start position:0%
is the uh other party
 
03:55:26.870 --> 03:55:26.880 align:start position:0%
here uh advised the Sierra California uh
 
03:55:29.830 --> 03:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
Sierra moderate police in California she
 
03:55:32.950 --> 03:55:32.960 align:start position:0%
had full custody of my minor children
 
03:55:36.950 --> 03:55:36.960 align:start position:0%
when that was not in indeed the case and
 
03:55:38.870 --> 03:55:38.880 align:start position:0%
I'm communicating with the school in
 
03:55:40.910 --> 03:55:40.920 align:start position:0%
police to find out why they've gone
 
03:55:42.790 --> 03:55:42.800 align:start position:0%
missing for 3
 
03:55:45.389 --> 03:55:45.399 align:start position:0%
Days uh one would think it would be a
 
03:55:48.070 --> 03:55:48.080 align:start position:0%
simple matter to run into Family Court
 
03:55:51.630 --> 03:55:51.640 align:start position:0%
to sort of sort this out but uh years
 
03:55:55.630 --> 03:55:55.640 align:start position:0%
later no hearing has ever been held on a
 
03:55:58.030 --> 03:55:58.040 align:start position:0%
simple and task to enforce the parenting
 
03:56:01.830 --> 03:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
plan in that case to the contrary it's
 
03:56:05.429 --> 03:56:05.439 align:start position:0%
gone up to the uh state supreme court
 
03:56:10.269 --> 03:56:10.279 align:start position:0%
who said per the current statute that um
 
03:56:13.110 --> 03:56:13.120 align:start position:0%
no they didn't have to have a hearing
 
03:56:17.189 --> 03:56:17.199 align:start position:0%
which is why we need to amend it and
 
03:56:17.199 --> 03:56:19.110 align:start position:0%
which is why we need to amend it and
most

03:56:19.110 --> 03:56:19.120 align:start position:0%
most
 
03:56:23.349 --> 03:56:23.359 align:start position:0%
recently uh I've even asked the US
 
03:56:28.149 --> 03:56:28.159 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court for review that's doit 23-
 
03:56:31.590 --> 03:56:31.600 align:start position:0%
6646 uh you could look that up online if
 
03:56:34.229 --> 03:56:34.239 align:start position:0%
you want to read all 60 pages of orders
 
03:56:36.670 --> 03:56:36.680 align:start position:0%
or somebody wants a copy I can give it
 
03:56:40.389 --> 03:56:40.399 align:start position:0%
to you but that's by
 
03:56:44.670 --> 03:56:44.680 align:start position:0%
request uh and the same for the petition
 
03:56:46.630 --> 03:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
itself so
 
03:56:49.469 --> 03:56:49.479 align:start position:0%
again uh that just really speaks to the
 
03:56:51.990 --> 03:56:52.000 align:start position:0%
need to amend the statute so we can have
 
03:56:54.950 --> 03:56:54.960 align:start position:0%
timely resolution of these
 
03:57:00.070 --> 03:57:00.080 align:start position:0%
matters uh with regard to the second
 
03:57:04.469 --> 03:57:04.479 align:start position:0%
part of the bill on
 
03:57:10.630 --> 03:57:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:13.910 --> 03:57:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh in email
 
03:57:16.349 --> 03:57:16.359 align:start position:0%
exchange uh there's a bunch of people
 
03:57:18.149 --> 03:57:18.159 align:start position:0%
here but some things I would point out
 
03:57:21.469 --> 03:57:21.479 align:start position:0%
to you is even though the parenting plan
 
03:57:24.790 --> 03:57:24.800 align:start position:0%
granted me full access to my children's
 
03:57:28.309 --> 03:57:28.319 align:start position:0%
records the principal of the high school
 
03:57:31.269 --> 03:57:31.279 align:start position:0%
says if I need anything I have to go
 
03:57:36.309 --> 03:57:36.319 align:start position:0%
through mom to facilitate requesting and
 
03:57:38.229 --> 03:57:38.239 align:start position:0%
that's kind of contrary to what my
 
03:57:41.149 --> 03:57:41.159 align:start position:0%
parent in plan
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
said uh when I'm trying to get
 
03:57:48.070 --> 03:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
appropriate Medical Counseling
 
03:57:52.110 --> 03:57:52.120 align:start position:0%
records I am essentially uh ghosted by
 
03:57:55.189 --> 03:57:55.199 align:start position:0%
the provider for a period of months it
 
03:57:57.630 --> 03:57:57.640 align:start position:0%
went up to a complaint you know at the
 
03:57:57.640 --> 03:57:59.149 align:start position:0%
went up to a complaint you know at the
regulatory

03:57:59.149 --> 03:57:59.159 align:start position:0%
regulatory
 
03:58:02.990 --> 03:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
level uh in the state of Michigan and
 
03:58:07.349 --> 03:58:07.359 align:start position:0%
now five months later I actually do have
 
03:58:09.510 --> 03:58:09.520 align:start position:0%
some simple records with what should
 
03:58:11.229 --> 03:58:11.239 align:start position:0%
have been a simple request going to give
 
03:58:13.309 --> 03:58:13.319 align:start position:0%
you about a minute and a half
 
03:58:17.630 --> 03:58:17.640 align:start position:0%
more um I think I'm mostly done I will
 
03:58:20.670 --> 03:58:20.680 align:start position:0%
just uh speak briefly to something rep
 
03:58:20.680 --> 03:58:21.550 align:start position:0%
just uh speak briefly to something rep
Greg

03:58:21.550 --> 03:58:21.560 align:start position:0%
Greg
 
03:58:24.309 --> 03:58:24.319 align:start position:0%
raised uh on the do we want to go back
 
03:58:28.070 --> 03:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
and forth you know three years or
 
03:58:32.070 --> 03:58:32.080 align:start position:0%
not uh don't really have a huge position
 
03:58:34.590 --> 03:58:34.600 align:start position:0%
on that but I'd refer that the Supreme
 
03:58:38.670 --> 03:58:38.680 align:start position:0%
Court in Miller of vdd sort of said that
 
03:58:40.070 --> 03:58:40.080 align:start position:0%
if you
 
03:58:43.510 --> 03:58:43.520 align:start position:0%
go with willful intent to withhold a
 
03:58:46.349 --> 03:58:46.359 align:start position:0%
parent it's strongly it's essentially
 
03:58:49.510 --> 03:58:49.520 align:start position:0%
child abuse on the part of the
 
03:58:53.429 --> 03:58:53.439 align:start position:0%
withholding parent any question done for
 
03:58:56.229 --> 03:58:56.239 align:start position:0%
questions any questions from Mr
 
03:58:58.590 --> 03:58:58.600 align:start position:0%
albre well thank you and I owe you 30
 
03:59:01.870 --> 03:59:01.880 align:start position:0%
seconds the next time you're here thank

thank you very much Mr chair thank you
 
03:59:29.349 --> 03:59:29.359 align:start position:0%
much for the to the uh members of the of
 
03:59:31.030 --> 03:59:31.040 align:start position:0%
the committee I represent Timothy Horan
 
03:59:34.070 --> 03:59:34.080 align:start position:0%
from straford County District 10 and I
 
03:59:35.910 --> 03:59:35.920 align:start position:0%
first heard about the parenting time and
 
03:59:37.910 --> 03:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed to the bill although I mean
 
03:59:39.750 --> 03:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
the concerns behind it are valid but
 
03:59:42.229 --> 03:59:42.239 align:start position:0%
this build isn't the right vehicle and
 
03:59:43.790 --> 03:59:43.800 align:start position:0%
doesn't go about fixing them the right
 
03:59:46.630 --> 03:59:46.640 align:start position:0%
way but anyway the years ago I served
 
03:59:47.630 --> 03:59:47.640 align:start position:0%
something called the petitions and
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
redress committee which former speaker
 
03:59:49.680 --> 03:59:50.429 align:start position:0%
redress committee which former speaker
Bill

03:59:50.429 --> 03:59:50.439 align:start position:0%
Bill
 
03:59:53.229 --> 03:59:53.239 align:start position:0%
O'Brien founded and it was mostly uh
 
03:59:58.349 --> 03:59:58.359 align:start position:0%
family law cases where uh one side
 
04:00:00.030 --> 04:00:00.040 align:start position:0%
usually was a father could be some there
 
04:00:02.189 --> 04:00:02.199 align:start position:0%
were some mothers who came in from one
 
04:00:05.429 --> 04:00:05.439 align:start position:0%
person you know their ability to get
 
04:00:07.309 --> 04:00:07.319 align:start position:0%
along with their co-parent and raise
 
04:00:09.110 --> 04:00:09.120 align:start position:0%
their children was they were impacted by
 
04:00:10.590 --> 04:00:10.600 align:start position:0%
what long running disputes between the
 
04:00:13.790 --> 04:00:13.800 align:start position:0%
two parties and this uh will probably
 
04:00:13.800 --> 04:00:14.750 align:start position:0%
two parties and this uh will probably
those

04:00:14.750 --> 04:00:14.760 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:00:17.030 --> 04:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
disputes happen before the committee me
 
04:00:18.429 --> 04:00:18.439 align:start position:0%
and it happened since since the
 
04:00:19.710 --> 04:00:19.720 align:start position:0%
committee existed and they're still
 
04:00:22.070 --> 04:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
going on but I'm not sure uh this bill
 
04:00:24.110 --> 04:00:24.120 align:start position:0%
is a bad way of going about fixing it
 
04:00:26.110 --> 04:00:26.120 align:start position:0%
because there our um first of all the
 
04:00:27.670 --> 04:00:27.680 align:start position:0%
whole thing about equal parenting time
 
04:00:30.070 --> 04:00:30.080 align:start position:0%
misses the point to the main purpose to
 
04:00:31.510 --> 04:00:31.520 align:start position:0%
have any parenting time with each your
 
04:00:33.349 --> 04:00:33.359 align:start position:0%
parent is for the good of the children
 
04:00:35.269 --> 04:00:35.279 align:start position:0%
so it's not primarily for the good of
 
04:00:38.070 --> 04:00:38.080 align:start position:0%
the father or mother it's for the it's
 
04:00:39.510 --> 04:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
for for the children so there may be
 
04:00:41.070 --> 04:00:41.080 align:start position:0%
cases where the equal parenting time
 
04:00:42.590 --> 04:00:42.600 align:start position:0%
there's many cases where that's not in
 
04:00:45.030 --> 04:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
the best distance of the child the part
 
04:00:47.790 --> 04:00:47.800 align:start position:0%
about any and all information even
 
04:00:50.269 --> 04:00:50.279 align:start position:0%
though it is there is a clause about
 
04:00:51.910 --> 04:00:51.920 align:start position:0%
precluding by state or federal law there
 
04:00:54.670 --> 04:00:54.680 align:start position:0%
may be cases um if there's allegations
 
04:00:58.189 --> 04:00:58.199 align:start position:0%
of abuse or other issues or if it's an
 
04:01:00.910 --> 04:01:00.920 align:start position:0%
issue involving not just one kid but
 
04:01:03.309 --> 04:01:03.319 align:start position:0%
some other some other
 
04:01:06.149 --> 04:01:06.159 align:start position:0%
children um so I think this bill will
 
04:01:08.750 --> 04:01:08.760 align:start position:0%
like force the schools and other parties
 
04:01:11.110 --> 04:01:11.120 align:start position:0%
to divulge certain information which
 
04:01:13.070 --> 04:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
normally they might not be divulging so
 
04:01:16.070 --> 04:01:16.080 align:start position:0%
readily and possibly for for for for for
 
04:01:21.590 --> 04:01:21.600 align:start position:0%
good reasons so I think and also um and
 
04:01:24.750 --> 04:01:24.760 align:start position:0%
Alo the uh penalty even though it's a
 
04:01:26.429 --> 04:01:26.439 align:start position:0%
civil penalty that can be quite
 
04:01:28.110 --> 04:01:28.120 align:start position:0%
excessive especially you know these
 
04:01:30.389 --> 04:01:30.399 align:start position:0%
things often go on these family law
 
04:01:31.950 --> 04:01:31.960 align:start position:0%
disputes over parenting plans other
 
04:01:34.189 --> 04:01:34.199 align:start position:0%
issues often go on for years some of
 
04:01:35.990 --> 04:01:36.000 align:start position:0%
them even seen the manage to go on
 
04:01:37.830 --> 04:01:37.840 align:start position:0%
somehow after the kid had already become
 
04:01:40.189 --> 04:01:40.199 align:start position:0%
an adult and gone off on their own but
 
04:01:43.149 --> 04:01:43.159 align:start position:0%
anyway that could be a very very large
 
04:01:46.269 --> 04:01:46.279 align:start position:0%
find probably inappropriately so so I
 
04:01:48.790 --> 04:01:48.800 align:start position:0%
would U let's so I would just say this
 
04:01:51.189 --> 04:01:51.199 align:start position:0%
bill the problem IT addresses is real
 
04:01:52.469 --> 04:01:52.479 align:start position:0%
but this is just not a very good
 
04:01:55.590 --> 04:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
solution to the problem and um and I
 
04:01:58.070 --> 04:01:58.080 align:start position:0%
also like I'm somewhat I'm also somewhat
 
04:01:59.790 --> 04:01:59.800 align:start position:0%
dubious about the concept of equal
 
04:02:01.590 --> 04:02:01.600 align:start position:0%
parenting time like managing down to the
 
04:02:03.070 --> 04:02:03.080 align:start position:0%
minut because once again just to repeat
 
04:02:05.429 --> 04:02:05.439 align:start position:0%
what I said already parenting time
 
04:02:07.149 --> 04:02:07.159 align:start position:0%
mostly exists for the benefit of the
 
04:02:09.429 --> 04:02:09.439 align:start position:0%
children so you know not it's not for
 
04:02:12.110 --> 04:02:12.120 align:start position:0%
the benefit of the parents but thank you
 
04:02:14.309 --> 04:02:14.319 align:start position:0%
so that's that's my testimony and I be
 
04:02:15.790 --> 04:02:15.800 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions if you have
 
04:02:19.670 --> 04:02:19.680 align:start position:0%
them any questions no when you uh speak
 
04:02:23.750 --> 04:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
representative to excessive fine I'm
 
04:02:26.469 --> 04:02:26.479 align:start position:0%
assuming you mean page two yes lines one
 
04:02:29.670 --> 04:02:29.680 align:start position:0%
two3 yeah $500 a day is that yeah I
 
04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
would suggest that it is the court that
 
04:02:35.309 --> 04:02:35.319 align:start position:0%
does it um and secondly it isn't
 
04:02:39.229 --> 04:02:39.239 align:start position:0%
required to do it it may do it so
 
04:02:43.110 --> 04:02:43.120 align:start position:0%
one would think perhaps it's an outlier
 
04:02:46.670 --> 04:02:46.680 align:start position:0%
for court to rack up $500 fine a day
 
04:02:48.910 --> 04:02:48.920 align:start position:0%
times five or six years what think yes I
 
04:02:50.269 --> 04:02:50.279 align:start position:0%
would think that's an outlier so I hope
 
04:02:52.030 --> 04:02:52.040 align:start position:0%
the courts aren't reasonable enough but
 
04:02:53.950 --> 04:02:53.960 align:start position:0%
just in case you get a judge who's
 
04:02:57.110 --> 04:02:57.120 align:start position:0%
judgment is poor um we don't want to let
 
04:03:00.030 --> 04:03:00.040 align:start position:0%
him or her exercise too much bad
 
04:03:01.790 --> 04:03:01.800 align:start position:0%
judgment in a case like that so thank
 
04:03:04.830 --> 04:03:04.840 align:start position:0%
you thanks anyone else thank you
 
04:03:07.550 --> 04:03:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative chair recognizes a former
 
04:03:09.550 --> 04:03:09.560 align:start position:0%

04:03:11.309 --> 04:03:11.319 align:start position:0%
great expense from Atkinson New

neighbors I guess I'm supposed to say
 
04:03:33.870 --> 04:03:33.880 align:start position:0%
I'm an honorable Betty gay The Honorable
 
04:03:36.070 --> 04:03:36.080 align:start position:0%
Betty gay once a member of this
 
04:03:40.309 --> 04:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
committee yes no always wished to be a
 
04:03:41.550 --> 04:03:41.560 align:start position:0%
member of this oh that's right you
 
04:03:43.349 --> 04:03:43.359 align:start position:0%
remember Health and Human Services when
 
04:03:45.030 --> 04:03:45.040 align:start position:0%
I was there I remember that now yeah you
 
04:03:48.550 --> 04:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:03:53.349 --> 04:03:53.359 align:start position:0%
ahead okay um I support this bill I also
 
04:03:55.349 --> 04:03:55.359 align:start position:0%
support the bill that y'all passed
 
04:03:58.990 --> 04:03:59.000 align:start position:0%
already and many of you uh helped create
 
04:04:03.349 --> 04:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
this just strengthens it um many
 
04:04:06.510 --> 04:04:06.520 align:start position:0%
times well I don't know about many times
 
04:04:08.269 --> 04:04:08.279 align:start position:0%
I'll just tell you my background very
 
04:04:13.309 --> 04:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
simply is I received child support I
 
04:04:16.630 --> 04:04:16.640 align:start position:0%
paid child support and when I got
 
04:04:19.750 --> 04:04:19.760 align:start position:0%
married a second time I went through the
 
04:04:25.389 --> 04:04:25.399 align:start position:0%
nightmare of not not ever knowing
 
04:04:28.750 --> 04:04:28.760 align:start position:0%
anything about my stepdaughter her
 
04:04:31.429 --> 04:04:31.439 align:start position:0%
mother did not want us to have anything
 
04:04:33.910 --> 04:04:33.920 align:start position:0%
she wanted to be paid for medical bills
 
04:04:36.429 --> 04:04:36.439 align:start position:0%
so she sent a page that was mostly
 
04:04:39.429 --> 04:04:39.439 align:start position:0%
redacted it wasn't even even multiple
 
04:04:41.790 --> 04:04:41.800 align:start position:0%
bills it was but my husband was trying
 
04:04:44.469 --> 04:04:44.479 align:start position:0%
to be peaceful and and he paid but we
 
04:04:48.830 --> 04:04:48.840 align:start position:0%
couldn't see anything so I understand
 
04:04:52.990 --> 04:04:53.000 align:start position:0%
how critical it is to put into law very
 
04:04:57.349 --> 04:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
clear directions about the rights of the
 
04:05:00.429 --> 04:05:00.439 align:start position:0%
noncustodial parent to know as much as
 
04:05:03.510 --> 04:05:03.520 align:start position:0%
possible about the child and to see and
 
04:05:05.790 --> 04:05:05.800 align:start position:0%
spend time with their child because we
 
04:05:09.110 --> 04:05:09.120 align:start position:0%
were denied from the time she was 14 we
 
04:05:12.870 --> 04:05:12.880 align:start position:0%
never saw her until she connected when
 
04:05:13.870 --> 04:05:13.880 align:start position:0%
she was
 
04:05:19.670 --> 04:05:19.680 align:start position:0%
32 that's a terrific loss um the the way
 
04:05:21.550 --> 04:05:21.560 align:start position:0%
this bill strengthens the bill that
 
04:05:25.990 --> 04:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
y'all already passed is the one of the
 
04:05:27.830 --> 04:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
sections just one of the things that it
 
04:05:33.590 --> 04:05:33.600 align:start position:0%
said um that the courts may do we think
 
04:05:37.550 --> 04:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
should be shall do and that is enforcing
 
04:05:40.630 --> 04:05:40.640 align:start position:0%
the time for the child to be with the
 
04:05:42.990 --> 04:05:43.000 align:start position:0%
parent that their court order says they
 
04:05:45.670 --> 04:05:45.680 align:start position:0%
should have this doesn't rewrite the
 
04:05:48.750 --> 04:05:48.760 align:start position:0%
court order it just says compliance
 
04:05:53.910 --> 04:05:53.920 align:start position:0%
needs to happen it shall happen
 
04:05:57.429 --> 04:05:57.439 align:start position:0%
um one of the problems that I saw other
 
04:05:59.630 --> 04:05:59.640 align:start position:0%
parents nodding their head when somebody
 
04:06:01.910 --> 04:06:01.920 align:start position:0%
made the statement while you have the
 
04:06:03.110 --> 04:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
police to
 
04:06:06.389 --> 04:06:06.399 align:start position:0%
enforce I don't know of any police force
 
04:06:08.309 --> 04:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
that enforces the
 
04:06:11.790 --> 04:06:11.800 align:start position:0%
visitation not any and I asked
 
04:06:15.229 --> 04:06:15.239 align:start position:0%
specifically in my own police uh
 
04:06:18.469 --> 04:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
Department who I trust greatly and their
 
04:06:21.349 --> 04:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
feeling was we're not going to force a
 
04:06:23.630 --> 04:06:23.640 align:start position:0%
child to leave if their other parent
 
04:06:26.030 --> 04:06:26.040 align:start position:0%
comes to get them and they don't want to
 
04:06:27.830 --> 04:06:27.840 align:start position:0%
and of course that puts them in a
 
04:06:30.630 --> 04:06:30.640 align:start position:0%
position they need the authority you're
 
04:06:33.030 --> 04:06:33.040 align:start position:0%
assuming they have authority they really
 
04:06:35.710 --> 04:06:35.720 align:start position:0%
don't and it makes them have to be a
 
04:06:38.550 --> 04:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
judge and a jury and a Psy psychologist
 
04:06:40.110 --> 04:06:40.120 align:start position:0%
to figure out whether they should take
 
04:06:43.309 --> 04:06:43.319 align:start position:0%
the child well we all know that it's
 
04:06:46.429 --> 04:06:46.439 align:start position:0%
damaging to a child to be denied the
 
04:06:48.910 --> 04:06:48.920 align:start position:0%
other parent unless of course that
 
04:06:51.389 --> 04:06:51.399 align:start position:0%
there's abuse going on that's a real
 
04:06:53.510 --> 04:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
serious issue that we all very concerned
 
04:06:56.710 --> 04:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
about but abuse is not we're not talking
 
04:06:59.030 --> 04:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
about abuse cases we're talking about a
 
04:07:01.429 --> 04:07:01.439 align:start position:0%
case of a parent being furious at the
 
04:07:03.670 --> 04:07:03.680 align:start position:0%
other parent and so they withhold a
 
04:07:06.590 --> 04:07:06.600 align:start position:0%
child because that's their best best way
 
04:07:11.070 --> 04:07:11.080 align:start position:0%
to get even for an unhappy marriage um
 
04:07:13.750 --> 04:07:13.760 align:start position:0%
one one of the criticisms of this bill
 
04:07:16.910 --> 04:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
was that they shouldn't say shall have
 
04:07:20.910 --> 04:07:20.920 align:start position:0%
equal time because that was fixed but in
 
04:07:22.950 --> 04:07:22.960 align:start position:0%
this bill if you look at line
 
04:07:26.710 --> 04:07:26.720 align:start position:0%
26a it ends shall be the same type and
 
04:07:28.710 --> 04:07:28.720 align:start position:0%
duration as the parenting time that was
 
04:07:32.189 --> 04:07:32.199 align:start position:0%
denied or a reasonable approximation
 
04:07:34.830 --> 04:07:34.840 align:start position:0%
thereof so it doesn't spell out exactly
 
04:07:37.269 --> 04:07:37.279 align:start position:0%
how that compensation should be
 
04:07:39.349 --> 04:07:39.359 align:start position:0%
calculated Rel ated are
 
04:07:42.469 --> 04:07:42.479 align:start position:0%
created um and I thought line
 
04:07:47.550 --> 04:07:47.560 align:start position:0%
29 uh as Panic said why is it second
 
04:07:49.590 --> 04:07:49.600 align:start position:0%
anniversary well on one hand you could
 
04:07:52.269 --> 04:07:52.279 align:start position:0%
say that's being really generous to the
 
04:07:55.590 --> 04:07:55.600 align:start position:0%
withholding parent but we have to talk
 
04:07:58.149 --> 04:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
about the reality of family court right
 
04:08:01.189 --> 04:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
now and the delays are tremendous the
 
04:08:05.389 --> 04:08:05.399 align:start position:0%
other the other uh thing that this bill
 
04:08:08.870 --> 04:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
uh spells out is
 
04:08:12.630 --> 04:08:12.640 align:start position:0%
um because of the delays and because
 
04:08:16.670 --> 04:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
of accusations of abuse and this other
 
04:08:18.030 --> 04:08:18.040 align:start position:0%
parents shouldn't have the child because
 
04:08:20.189 --> 04:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
of this and this and this well that has
 
04:08:22.149 --> 04:08:22.159 align:start position:0%
to be uh
 
04:08:26.030 --> 04:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
studied the study can take months so
 
04:08:29.349 --> 04:08:29.359 align:start position:0%
what this bill the the amended bill I
 
04:08:30.630 --> 04:08:30.640 align:start position:0%
don't think it's spelled out right here
 
04:08:32.710 --> 04:08:32.720 align:start position:0%
in the plain Bill dance around it but
 
04:08:36.429 --> 04:08:36.439 align:start position:0%
don't be specific okay what what it
 
04:08:39.229 --> 04:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
attempts to do
 
04:08:43.670 --> 04:08:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:08:48.109 --> 04:08:48.119 align:start position:0%
think if it's a false if it's a false
 
04:08:51.469 --> 04:08:51.479 align:start position:0%
concern that takes us a few months to
 
04:08:54.070 --> 04:08:54.080 align:start position:0%
set uh to determine that they really is
 
04:08:56.309 --> 04:08:56.319 align:start position:0%
no reason the child should not be with
 
04:08:58.550 --> 04:08:58.560 align:start position:0%
the other parent that other parent now
 
04:09:02.630 --> 04:09:02.640 align:start position:0%
has lost all that time so what the what
 
04:09:05.189 --> 04:09:05.199 align:start position:0%
this bill will do if
 
04:09:09.510 --> 04:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
it's amended is is to grant that person
 
04:09:11.870 --> 04:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
who missed out on their child's time
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
that time that they lose while it's
 
04:09:17.469 --> 04:09:17.479 align:start position:0%
being studied is also included in the
 
04:09:21.590 --> 04:09:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:23.870 --> 04:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
lost is it your
 
04:09:26.550 --> 04:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
experience um in the background to this
 
04:09:29.269 --> 04:09:29.279 align:start position:0%
is chairing the special committee on the
 
04:09:31.189 --> 04:09:31.199 align:start position:0%
Family Division of the Circuit Court it
 
04:09:33.870 --> 04:09:33.880 align:start position:0%
was the testimony by people there that
 
04:09:35.469 --> 04:09:35.479 align:start position:0%
the court would order something the
 
04:09:37.630 --> 04:09:37.640 align:start position:0%
police wouldn't enforce it because they
 
04:09:39.149 --> 04:09:39.159 align:start position:0%
said that's really the Court's business
 
04:09:41.109 --> 04:09:41.119 align:start position:0%
and the court says we don't have an army
 
04:09:43.630 --> 04:09:43.640 align:start position:0%
and it sort of lived in limbo do you
 
04:09:45.510 --> 04:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
think this bill might help in some small
 
04:09:48.109 --> 04:09:48.119 align:start position:0%
way to address that I think it's another
 
04:09:51.469 --> 04:09:51.479 align:start position:0%
strong step toward that I mean next time
 
04:09:53.790 --> 04:09:53.800 align:start position:0%
maybe we really need to put a bill in
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
that says the local police or the
 
04:09:58.269 --> 04:09:58.279 align:start position:0%
sheriff's whatever whoever has the
 
04:10:01.030 --> 04:10:01.040 align:start position:0%
authority in that uh place where it's
 
04:10:04.309 --> 04:10:04.319 align:start position:0%
taking place that they really have the
 
04:10:07.070 --> 04:10:07.080 align:start position:0%
authority and responsibility to enforce
 
04:10:07.080 --> 04:10:09.030 align:start position:0%
authority and responsibility to enforce
it

04:10:09.030 --> 04:10:09.040 align:start position:0%
it
 
04:10:11.790 --> 04:10:11.800 align:start position:0%
repres I'll call Representative
 
04:10:15.070 --> 04:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
Gibbons thank you Mr chairman
 
04:10:18.590 --> 04:10:18.600 align:start position:0%
um I don't maybe you could explain how
 
04:10:20.510 --> 04:10:20.520 align:start position:0%
you think that the police would be able
 
04:10:23.670 --> 04:10:23.680 align:start position:0%
to uh enforce that because the problem
 
04:10:26.630 --> 04:10:26.640 align:start position:0%
is that over the course of a child's
 
04:10:28.830 --> 04:10:28.840 align:start position:0%
childhood there could be many uh
 
04:10:31.309 --> 04:10:31.319 align:start position:0%
different orders that are written and
 
04:10:34.429 --> 04:10:34.439 align:start position:0%
without a database to access what is the
 
04:10:38.109 --> 04:10:38.119 align:start position:0%
most recent order then the the you know
 
04:10:39.469 --> 04:10:39.479 align:start position:0%
some of these some of these types of
 
04:10:42.309 --> 04:10:42.319 align:start position:0%
parents are malicious and they could
 
04:10:45.070 --> 04:10:45.080 align:start position:0%
present old orders and say oh look this
 
04:10:47.429 --> 04:10:47.439 align:start position:0%
is the order set and there's actually a
 
04:10:49.269 --> 04:10:49.279 align:start position:0%
new order that's in there and the police
 
04:10:51.269 --> 04:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
would at this point in time have no way
 
04:10:55.309 --> 04:10:55.319 align:start position:0%
of knowing that so maybe you could
 
04:10:57.510 --> 04:10:57.520 align:start position:0%
explain how you think that it would be
 
04:10:59.750 --> 04:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
able to be enforced because I don't see
 
04:11:03.149 --> 04:11:03.159 align:start position:0%
it as enforcable right now may I answer
 
04:11:06.830 --> 04:11:06.840 align:start position:0%
yeah she both parents both parents have
 
04:11:09.510 --> 04:11:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:11:12.149 --> 04:11:12.159 align:start position:0%
so it's both parents can show the
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
policeman most recent order follow up
 
04:11:19.030 --> 04:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
follow up that being said that's very
 
04:11:22.469 --> 04:11:22.479 align:start position:0%
time consuming on the part of the police
 
04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
to have to go between both parents and
 
04:11:26.109 --> 04:11:26.119 align:start position:0%
the malicious parents not going to show
 
04:11:27.870 --> 04:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
the most recent order if it's not in
 
04:11:27.880 --> 04:11:28.590 align:start position:0%
the most recent order if it's not in
their

04:11:28.590 --> 04:11:28.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
04:11:32.229 --> 04:11:32.239 align:start position:0%
interest so that's that's where we we
 
04:11:36.590 --> 04:11:36.600 align:start position:0%
get into like a hangup where where it it
 
04:11:39.910 --> 04:11:39.920 align:start position:0%
becomes he said she said well both
 
04:11:42.429 --> 04:11:42.439 align:start position:0%
parents have orders that have dates on
 
04:11:45.590 --> 04:11:45.600 align:start position:0%
them so the most recent date and what
 
04:11:49.309 --> 04:11:49.319 align:start position:0%
we're hoping is that once this bill goes
 
04:11:53.149 --> 04:11:53.159 align:start position:0%
once this goes into law the first couple
 
04:11:55.670 --> 04:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
of people may try to test
 
04:11:58.469 --> 04:11:58.479 align:start position:0%
it but if they found out that they're
 
04:12:02.269 --> 04:12:02.279 align:start position:0%
going to hurt because they violated the
 
04:12:05.189 --> 04:12:05.199 align:start position:0%
order then other people will learn it's
 
04:12:08.950 --> 04:12:08.960 align:start position:0%
not really worth doing
 
04:12:11.389 --> 04:12:11.399 align:start position:0%
we pay police to protect us and this is
 
04:12:15.030 --> 04:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
a very serious painful thing that
 
04:12:18.670 --> 04:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
happens to so many people because of the
 
04:12:22.229 --> 04:12:22.239 align:start position:0%
maliciousness of some parents so it's
 
04:12:24.349 --> 04:12:24.359 align:start position:0%
yes it's timec consuming but they
 
04:12:26.309 --> 04:12:26.319 align:start position:0%
shouldn't have to go back and forth they
 
04:12:29.109 --> 04:12:29.119 align:start position:0%
can be on one doorstep you show me your
 
04:12:32.429 --> 04:12:32.439 align:start position:0%
orders let's see who's this current any
 
04:12:36.229 --> 04:12:36.239 align:start position:0%
further questions for the retired
 
04:12:36.239 --> 04:12:38.429 align:start position:0%
further questions for the retired
representative

04:12:38.429 --> 04:12:38.439 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:12:41.349 --> 04:12:41.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you so much thank
 
04:12:56.990 --> 04:12:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.000 --> 04:12:58.670 align:start position:0%
 
good

04:12:58.670 --> 04:12:58.680 align:start position:0%
good

Hur New Hampshire I'm testifying in
 
04:13:10.630 --> 04:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
support of this bill as our elected
 
04:13:12.109 --> 04:13:12.119 align:start position:0%
policy makers each of you have the
 
04:13:14.630 --> 04:13:14.640 align:start position:0%
greatest ability to reform outdated
 
04:13:17.389 --> 04:13:17.399 align:start position:0%
laws and bring them into constitutional
 
04:13:18.990 --> 04:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
compliance to better protect New
 
04:13:21.950 --> 04:13:21.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire children many New Hampshire
 
04:13:24.510 --> 04:13:24.520 align:start position:0%
children have parents who share custody
 
04:13:27.550 --> 04:13:27.560 align:start position:0%
after separation or divorce often times
 
04:13:29.990 --> 04:13:30.000 align:start position:0%
after the parties have been to court and
 
04:13:32.309 --> 04:13:32.319 align:start position:0%
have a court ordered parenting plan in
 
04:13:34.429 --> 04:13:34.439 align:start position:0%
place one parent or the other May
 
04:13:36.710 --> 04:13:36.720 align:start position:0%
interfere or obstruct custody by way of
 
04:13:38.670 --> 04:13:38.680 align:start position:0%
keeping the the minor child on the other
 
04:13:41.030 --> 04:13:41.040 align:start position:0%
parents court ordered parenting time
 
04:13:43.309 --> 04:13:43.319 align:start position:0%
withholding them prior to a holiday or
 
04:13:45.670 --> 04:13:45.680 align:start position:0%
perhaps make a false report of abuse or
 
04:13:48.109 --> 04:13:48.119 align:start position:0%
neglect or domestic violence to be
 
04:13:50.070 --> 04:13:50.080 align:start position:0%
vindictive or simply extend their own
 
04:13:53.670 --> 04:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
parenting time improperly holding a
 
04:13:56.830 --> 04:13:56.840 align:start position:0%
withholding a child is child abuse
 
04:13:58.710 --> 04:13:58.720 align:start position:0%
during the investigation process of
 
04:14:00.950 --> 04:14:00.960 align:start position:0%
these issues a child parent relationship
 
04:14:04.189 --> 04:14:04.199 align:start position:0%
can be harmed investigations can and do
 
04:14:06.550 --> 04:14:06.560 align:start position:0%
take weeks if not months the same holds
 
04:14:08.469 --> 04:14:08.479 align:start position:0%
true for trying to get a hearing in the
 
04:14:11.030 --> 04:14:11.040 align:start position:0%
Family Court allowing the obstructing
 
04:14:13.710 --> 04:14:13.720 align:start position:0%
parent to withhold the child only on
 
04:14:16.750 --> 04:14:16.760 align:start position:0%
precaution for extended periods of time
 
04:14:18.750 --> 04:14:18.760 align:start position:0%
when the family court is taking a
 
04:14:21.149 --> 04:14:21.159 align:start position:0%
parental right away only on precaution
 
04:14:22.910 --> 04:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
and when they return the child and not
 
04:14:25.149 --> 04:14:25.159 align:start position:0%
the time that was lost this becomes a
 
04:14:28.189 --> 04:14:28.199 align:start position:0%
human rights issue more often than not
 
04:14:31.510 --> 04:14:31.520 align:start position:0%
the reports are unfounded a 2021 study
 
04:14:34.750 --> 04:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
noted that roughly 83% of abuse and
 
04:14:37.349 --> 04:14:37.359 align:start position:0%
neglect reports that are investigated
 
04:14:39.950 --> 04:14:39.960 align:start position:0%
ultimately Pro to be unfounded or
 
04:14:42.510 --> 04:14:42.520 align:start position:0%
unsubstantiated among only those reports
 
04:14:44.590 --> 04:14:44.600 align:start position:0%
that are made anonymously the number
 
04:14:46.429 --> 04:14:46.439 align:start position:0%
Rises to
 
04:14:49.790 --> 04:14:49.800 align:start position:0%
96% this means one out of every 25
 
04:14:51.790 --> 04:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
anonymous calls leads to credible
 
04:14:54.030 --> 04:14:54.040 align:start position:0%
evidence of Abus or neglect and many of
 
04:14:56.550 --> 04:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
the 24 are knowingly false reports used
 
04:14:58.389 --> 04:14:58.399 align:start position:0%
to weaponize the
 
04:15:00.550 --> 04:15:00.560 align:start position:0%
system we also heard in the special
 
04:15:01.830 --> 04:15:01.840 align:start position:0%
committee investigate in the Family
 
04:15:04.070 --> 04:15:04.080 align:start position:0%
Court the former Commissioner of DCF
 
04:15:06.229 --> 04:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
testified they received just north of
 
04:15:09.109 --> 04:15:09.119 align:start position:0%
20,000 call to Central intake per year
 
04:15:10.550 --> 04:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
just north of
 
04:15:13.030 --> 04:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
10,000 are screened out and the other
 
04:15:15.389 --> 04:15:15.399 align:start position:0%
10,000 are assessed or investigated for
 
04:15:17.030 --> 04:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
abuse or neglect and they count in the
 
04:15:19.389 --> 04:15:19.399 align:start position:0%
hundreds how many actually go to court
 
04:15:21.429 --> 04:15:21.439 align:start position:0%
this bill seeks to remedy two concerns
 
04:15:23.389 --> 04:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
that parents face after separation of
 
04:15:25.309 --> 04:15:25.319 align:start position:0%
divorce and after having a lawful court
 
04:15:28.710 --> 04:15:28.720 align:start position:0%

allows resources to be used
 
04:17:14.630 --> 04:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
appropriately and alleviates the already
 
04:17:18.070 --> 04:17:18.080 align:start position:0%
overburden court system by stating in
 
04:17:20.469 --> 04:17:20.479 align:start position:0%
this bill shall return the time instead
 
04:17:22.950 --> 04:17:22.960 align:start position:0%
of May it shifts the burden of proof to
 
04:17:24.790 --> 04:17:24.800 align:start position:0%
the defendant to prove why the time
 
04:17:26.349 --> 04:17:26.359 align:start position:0%
should not be
 
04:17:28.510 --> 04:17:28.520 align:start position:0%
restored thank
 
04:17:33.710 --> 04:17:33.720 align:start position:0%

questions

um there will there will be a question
 
04:17:40.389 --> 04:17:40.399 align:start position:0%
at the end of this
 
04:17:43.229 --> 04:17:43.239 align:start position:0%
sentence I notice in line 8 it talks
 
04:17:46.710 --> 04:17:46.720 align:start position:0%
about professional and then line 10
 
04:17:49.469 --> 04:17:49.479 align:start position:0%
medical one of my day jobs as part-time
 
04:17:52.389 --> 04:17:52.399 align:start position:0%
CEO of a medical and Counseling Center
 
04:17:55.510 --> 04:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
so I have three primary care providers
 
04:18:00.630 --> 04:18:00.640 align:start position:0%
under me and it initially bothered me
 
04:18:04.030 --> 04:18:04.040 align:start position:0%
that they could be simply ordered to
 
04:18:07.630 --> 04:18:07.640 align:start position:0%
Fork over the records MH but would line
 
04:18:11.030 --> 04:18:11.040 align:start position:0%
13 at the beginning mitigate my fears
 
04:18:14.550 --> 04:18:14.560 align:start position:0%
when it says without good cause if they
 
04:18:16.750 --> 04:18:16.760 align:start position:0%
had good cause and I can think of a
 
04:18:19.710 --> 04:18:19.720 align:start position:0%
number of good causes they would not be
 
04:18:22.870 --> 04:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
held in any contempt for failing to hand
 
04:18:26.149 --> 04:18:26.159 align:start position:0%
over records is that the import of the
 
04:18:27.750 --> 04:18:27.760 align:start position:0%
phrase without good
 
04:18:30.510 --> 04:18:30.520 align:start position:0%
cause I would say
 
04:18:34.269 --> 04:18:34.279 align:start position:0%
yes thank you I don't have numbers on my
 
04:18:37.630 --> 04:18:37.640 align:start position:0%
paper oh okay um
 
04:18:39.030 --> 04:18:39.040 align:start position:0%
yeah if they're withholding it for good
 
04:18:40.710 --> 04:18:40.720 align:start position:0%
cause and the parent can always go to
 
04:18:43.510 --> 04:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
court and get a subpoena to have it
 
04:18:47.149 --> 04:18:47.159 align:start position:0%

General I am a grandmother to maav and
 
04:19:41.389 --> 04:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
Quinn who have been taken and isolated
 
04:19:43.149 --> 04:19:43.159 align:start position:0%
from their loving mother and one half of
 
04:19:46.070 --> 04:19:46.080 align:start position:0%
their family for no justifiable reason
 
04:19:48.030 --> 04:19:48.040 align:start position:0%
for more than one
 
04:19:50.750 --> 04:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
year interference with child custody and
 
04:19:52.630 --> 04:19:52.640 align:start position:0%
shared parenting is an egregious
 
04:19:55.670 --> 04:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
violation of parent of parental rights
 
04:19:58.429 --> 04:19:58.439 align:start position:0%
that undermines parental Authority it is
 
04:20:01.229 --> 04:20:01.239 align:start position:0%
a deliberate action by one parent to put
 
04:20:03.429 --> 04:20:03.439 align:start position:0%
the children in the middle of a custody
 
04:20:05.830 --> 04:20:05.840 align:start position:0%
dispute and it is detrimental to the
 
04:20:07.269 --> 04:20:07.279 align:start position:0%
child's physical
 
04:20:09.510 --> 04:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
emotional and mental
 
04:20:11.950 --> 04:20:11.960 align:start position:0%
well-being it deprives a child of their
 
04:20:13.950 --> 04:20:13.960 align:start position:0%
right to love and be loved by a parent
 
04:20:16.269 --> 04:20:16.279 align:start position:0%
and one half of their
 
04:20:18.710 --> 04:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
family interference with child custody
 
04:20:21.670 --> 04:20:21.680 align:start position:0%
and shared parenting is Family Violence
 
04:20:24.389 --> 04:20:24.399 align:start position:0%
and a child protection issue Mal
 
04:20:26.710 --> 04:20:26.720 align:start position:0%
treatment of children used as Weapons
 
04:20:28.269 --> 04:20:28.279 align:start position:0%
I'm going to stop you here you're
 
04:20:30.550 --> 04:20:30.560 align:start position:0%
reading your testimony and we will be
 
04:20:32.710 --> 04:20:32.720 align:start position:0%
reading it so therefore I'd like you to
 
04:20:35.189 --> 04:20:35.199 align:start position:0%

04:20:38.510 --> 04:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
okay um well as a grandmother I am
 
04:20:40.429 --> 04:20:40.439 align:start position:0%
appalled and shocked to learn of the
 
04:20:42.510 --> 04:20:42.520 align:start position:0%
thousands and hundreds of thousands of
 
04:20:45.630 --> 04:20:45.640 align:start position:0%
families that that live
 
04:20:48.309 --> 04:20:48.319 align:start position:0%
through the tragedy that that we have
 
04:20:51.510 --> 04:20:51.520 align:start position:0%
been living through you have no idea
 
04:20:53.710 --> 04:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
what it's like there's not a day that
 
04:20:55.910 --> 04:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
goes by that I don't miss my
 
04:20:58.030 --> 04:20:58.040 align:start position:0%
grandchildren my husband and I don't
 
04:21:00.710 --> 04:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
know if we will live long enough to see
 
04:21:03.349 --> 04:21:03.359 align:start position:0%
them again and we will never get back
 
04:21:07.830 --> 04:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
the lost time that's been taken from us
 
04:21:09.870 --> 04:21:09.880 align:start position:0%
there are states that that make it a
 
04:21:12.990 --> 04:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor and even a felony to
 
04:21:14.590 --> 04:21:14.600 align:start position:0%
interfere with child custody and
 
04:21:17.469 --> 04:21:17.479 align:start position:0%
parenting time I think New Hampshire
 
04:21:19.510 --> 04:21:19.520 align:start position:0%
needs to step it up and have
 
04:21:21.710 --> 04:21:21.720 align:start position:0%
consequences there are no consequences
 
04:21:26.109 --> 04:21:26.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:29.109 --> 04:21:29.119 align:start position:0%
children despite a court order a judge's
 
04:21:33.189 --> 04:21:33.199 align:start position:0%
order and has not returned them our
 
04:21:35.630 --> 04:21:35.640 align:start position:0%
journey through family court has been
 
04:21:37.950 --> 04:21:37.960 align:start position:0%
filing a motion for contempt when it
 
04:21:40.429 --> 04:21:40.439 align:start position:0%
happened his attorney filed an objection
 
04:21:43.229 --> 04:21:43.239 align:start position:0%
to the motion for contempt the judge
 
04:21:45.389 --> 04:21:45.399 align:start position:0%
said there was a hearing the judge
 
04:21:47.109 --> 04:21:47.119 align:start position:0%
ordered the children to be returned to
 
04:21:49.870 --> 04:21:49.880 align:start position:0%
my daughter on October 14th of 2022 we
 
04:21:57.149 --> 04:21:57.159 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:59.670 --> 04:21:59.680 align:start position:0%
again and down the rabbit hole we go
 
04:22:02.550 --> 04:22:02.560 align:start position:0%
with the G and the hearings that are
 
04:22:02.560 --> 04:22:04.070 align:start position:0%
with the G and the hearings that are
rescheduled

04:22:04.070 --> 04:22:04.080 align:start position:0%
rescheduled
 
04:22:07.109 --> 04:22:07.119 align:start position:0%
and it's just been a nightmare I think
 
04:22:08.229 --> 04:22:08.239 align:start position:0%
that some
 
04:22:08.239 --> 04:22:10.109 align:start position:0%
that some
accountability

04:22:10.109 --> 04:22:10.119 align:start position:0%
accountability
 
04:22:14.429 --> 04:22:14.439 align:start position:0%
for these people who are doing this to
 
04:22:17.590 --> 04:22:17.600 align:start position:0%
the children is imperative and
 
04:22:19.550 --> 04:22:19.560 align:start position:0%
consequences need to be there Justice
 
04:22:22.429 --> 04:22:22.439 align:start position:0%
denied is in fact Justice delayed is in
 
04:22:25.030 --> 04:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
fact Justice denied and they're getting
 
04:22:27.189 --> 04:22:27.199 align:start position:0%
away with it legally they're getting
 
04:22:29.790 --> 04:22:29.800 align:start position:0%
away with the abuse the post- divorce
 
04:22:32.670 --> 04:22:32.680 align:start position:0%
abuse that's often times what what is
 
04:22:35.349 --> 04:22:35.359 align:start position:0%
involved here
 
04:22:35.359 --> 04:22:43.389 align:start position:0%
involved here
um

04:22:43.389 --> 04:22:43.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:46.269 --> 04:22:46.279 align:start position:0%
see give you about 30 seconds to wrap it
 
04:22:49.149 --> 04:22:49.159 align:start position:0%
up I think your informal testimony for
 
04:22:50.910 --> 04:22:50.920 align:start position:0%
me at least was more compelling than
 
04:22:52.550 --> 04:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
reading a script I'd like to say that I
 
04:22:54.429 --> 04:22:54.439 align:start position:0%
pray that you take the collective power
 
04:22:56.189 --> 04:22:56.199 align:start position:0%
that you have been given to affect this
 
04:22:59.710 --> 04:22:59.720 align:start position:0%
important necessary legislation to defer
 
04:23:01.910 --> 04:23:01.920 align:start position:0%
to deter interference with child custody
 
04:23:03.870 --> 04:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
and parenting time and the absolute
 
04:23:05.790 --> 04:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
devastating effects it has on children
 
04:23:07.389 --> 04:23:07.399 align:start position:0%

we will be executing this bill on March
 
04:23:13.710 --> 04:23:13.720 align:start position:0%

any changes and and so on to take place
 
04:23:19.830 --> 04:23:19.840 align:start position:0%

longer a state representative he
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
resigned the house last Friday and uh
 
04:27:24.750 --> 04:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
here's the bill and I'm at your pleasure
 
04:27:26.229 --> 04:27:26.239 align:start position:0%
on what to
 
04:27:29.990 --> 04:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
do yes representative Molson thank you
 
04:27:33.149 --> 04:27:33.159 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman so if he's no longer a state
 
04:27:35.950 --> 04:27:35.960 align:start position:0%
representative then what's the pro
 
04:27:39.070 --> 04:27:39.080 align:start position:0%
process how can he have a bill here he
 
04:27:41.630 --> 04:27:41.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't the bill on first reading came
 
04:27:44.630 --> 04:27:44.640 align:start position:0%
to us in January it's been our bill
 
04:27:45.990 --> 04:27:46.000 align:start position:0%
remember that time when they all talked
 
04:27:48.510 --> 04:27:48.520 align:start position:0%
fast and nobody paid attention that was
 
04:27:51.590 --> 04:27:51.600 align:start position:0%
when the bills went from in effect the
 
04:27:54.550 --> 04:27:54.560 align:start position:0%
custody of the Prime sponsor to the
 
04:27:57.109 --> 04:27:57.119 align:start position:0%
Committees so this has been our bill
 
04:27:58.830 --> 04:27:58.840 align:start position:0%
since but then someone has to adopt it
 
04:28:02.030 --> 04:28:02.040 align:start position:0%
some is what representative Petrino
 
04:28:04.389 --> 04:28:04.399 align:start position:0%
introduced it so we're now having a
 
04:28:16.550 --> 04:28:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:19.870 --> 04:28:19.880 align:start position:0%
anybody want to say anything about this
 
04:28:23.309 --> 04:28:23.319 align:start position:0%
on the committee I do who is I do oh you
 
04:28:26.550 --> 04:28:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:28:30.269 --> 04:28:30.279 align:start position:0%
Perez you do yes I I have a lot to say
 
04:28:32.870 --> 04:28:32.880 align:start position:0%
about this bill because okay uh to be
 
04:28:37.950 --> 04:28:37.960 align:start position:0%
honest if um we not allow in or like
 
04:28:40.990 --> 04:28:41.000 align:start position:0%
make it difficult for
 
04:28:45.790 --> 04:28:45.800 align:start position:0%
um sexual assault victims to have an
 
04:28:47.950 --> 04:28:47.960 align:start position:0%
abortion well
 
04:28:51.030 --> 04:28:51.040 align:start position:0%
they the Dad should be responsible to
 
04:28:53.750 --> 04:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
pay child child support they you know
 
04:28:57.189 --> 04:28:57.199 align:start position:0%
they don't wanted um females to to have
 
04:28:58.630 --> 04:28:58.640 align:start position:0%
the right to decide what's happening
 
04:29:02.790 --> 04:29:02.800 align:start position:0%
with their body so the parents should be
 
04:29:05.229 --> 04:29:05.239 align:start position:0%
responsible to pay child support if they
 
04:29:05.239 --> 04:29:06.910 align:start position:0%
responsible to pay child support if they
wanted

04:29:06.910 --> 04:29:06.920 align:start position:0%
wanted
 
04:29:10.189 --> 04:29:10.199 align:start position:0%
push the mother to continue the
 
04:29:13.070 --> 04:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
pregnancy even when she wasn't even
 
04:29:15.389 --> 04:29:15.399 align:start position:0%
wanted to have that child but she was
 
04:29:19.149 --> 04:29:19.159 align:start position:0%
pushed by sexual soul to carry that
 
04:29:22.030 --> 04:29:22.040 align:start position:0%
baby that's all I has to say thank you
 
04:29:25.990 --> 04:29:26.000 align:start position:0%
for your your comments representative U
 
04:29:30.590 --> 04:29:30.600 align:start position:0%
Panic thank you uh chairman um and I'd
 
04:29:32.790 --> 04:29:32.800 align:start position:0%
like to say
 
04:29:35.950 --> 04:29:35.960 align:start position:0%
that the mother has a choice up to the
 
04:29:41.550 --> 04:29:41.560 align:start position:0%
month of uh was it 24 weeks 24 weeks
 
04:29:44.030 --> 04:29:44.040 align:start position:0%
yeah 24 weeks to choose to have an
 
04:29:47.630 --> 04:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
abortion so that choice is still given
 
04:29:50.109 --> 04:29:50.119 align:start position:0%
to the mother up to six
 
04:29:53.670 --> 04:29:53.680 align:start position:0%
months um would you not think the father
 
04:29:56.510 --> 04:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
has any respon if if known the father
 
04:29:59.590 --> 04:29:59.600 align:start position:0%
has any responsibility for costs
 
04:30:01.910 --> 04:30:01.920 align:start position:0%
incurred by the mother or can the father
 
04:30:07.429 --> 04:30:07.439 align:start position:0%
just say see you later well
 
04:30:08.910 --> 04:30:08.920 align:start position:0%
where she's talking about a rape
 
04:30:11.830 --> 04:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
situation you know who your rapist is
 
04:30:14.030 --> 04:30:14.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes sometimes sometimes yeah
 
04:30:16.149 --> 04:30:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's true we don't always know that
 
04:30:18.830 --> 04:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
and then there's another are area that
 
04:30:21.550 --> 04:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
gets a little gray is sometimes the F
 
04:30:23.189 --> 04:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
they don't know who they don't know who
 
04:30:26.790 --> 04:30:26.800 align:start position:0%
the father is so that's hard to
 
04:30:29.910 --> 04:30:29.920 align:start position:0%
prove until after the birth am I correct
 
04:30:31.990 --> 04:30:32.000 align:start position:0%
I'm not a
 
04:30:36.309 --> 04:30:36.319 align:start position:0%
nurse thank you um yes there I I believe
 
04:30:38.229 --> 04:30:38.239 align:start position:0%
because I've I've read through all of
 
04:30:41.750 --> 04:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
the um actual statutes in this state I
 
04:30:43.710 --> 04:30:43.720 align:start position:0%
believe that they do have to establish
 
04:30:47.630 --> 04:30:47.640 align:start position:0%
per uh paternity after birth right so
 
04:30:49.910 --> 04:30:49.920 align:start position:0%
that would make it difficult
 
04:30:53.550 --> 04:30:53.560 align:start position:0%
to implement this if a paternity hasn't
 
04:30:55.990 --> 04:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
been established it would make it
 
04:31:01.389 --> 04:31:01.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:01.399 --> 04:31:04.550 align:start position:0%
 
youbody

04:31:04.550 --> 04:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:04.560 --> 04:31:10.229 align:start position:0%
 
else

04:31:10.229 --> 04:31:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:31:13.349 --> 04:31:13.359 align:start position:0%
is it the pleasure of the committee to
 
04:31:15.790 --> 04:31:15.800 align:start position:0%
go forward to execute or do you want to
 
04:31:17.750 --> 04:31:17.760 align:start position:0%

04:32:30.750 --> 04:32:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:32:34.030 --> 04:32:34.040 align:start position:0%
tired you're among friends
 
04:32:37.269 --> 04:32:37.279 align:start position:0%
here and representative Greg second's
 
04:32:41.349 --> 04:32:41.359 align:start position:0%
itl now we can do what you did and speak
 
04:32:44.269 --> 04:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
about it if you
 
04:32:47.269 --> 04:32:47.279 align:start position:0%
wish I passed thank you that's all right
 
04:32:50.109 --> 04:32:50.119 align:start position:0%
you you gave a good talk go
 
04:32:52.790 --> 04:32:52.800 align:start position:0%
representative long I see somebody wants
 
04:32:54.790 --> 04:32:54.800 align:start position:0%
to speak on
 
04:32:57.990 --> 04:32:58.000 align:start position:0%
it representative LEC yeah I think that
 
04:32:59.750 --> 04:32:59.760 align:start position:0%
it's don't pronounce all the
 
04:33:02.950 --> 04:33:02.960 align:start position:0%
letters I think it's kind of hard to
 
04:33:05.109 --> 04:33:05.119 align:start position:0%
with standing law and with this bill it
 
04:33:07.789 --> 04:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
kind of contradicts of how to determine
 
04:33:09.830 --> 04:33:09.840 align:start position:0%
paternity when you have to do it after
 
04:33:11.789 --> 04:33:11.799 align:start position:0%
the birth so they can't exactly
 
04:33:13.990 --> 04:33:14.000 align:start position:0%
determine child support when paternity
 
04:33:16.670 --> 04:33:16.680 align:start position:0%
isn't determined until after the child
 
04:33:16.680 --> 04:33:17.590 align:start position:0%
isn't determined until after the child
is

04:33:17.590 --> 04:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:33:21.070 --> 04:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
born and this kind of contradicts the
 
04:33:22.789 --> 04:33:22.799 align:start position:0%
law and I think that we can all agree to
 
04:33:25.670 --> 04:33:25.680 align:start position:0%
that thank you
 
04:33:28.510 --> 04:33:28.520 align:start position:0%
representative Gibbons thank you Mr
 
04:33:30.551 --> 04:33:30.561 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah there's a lot of problems
 
04:33:32.310 --> 04:33:32.320 align:start position:0%
with this bill um first of all they did
 
04:33:36.349 --> 04:33:36.359 align:start position:0%
it in 10 lines too right first of all it
 
04:33:38.150 --> 04:33:38.160 align:start position:0%
if we're if we're talking about
 
04:33:42.310 --> 04:33:42.320 align:start position:0%
establishing child support then that
 
04:33:44.709 --> 04:33:44.719 align:start position:0%
opens up the door as to abortion rights
 
04:33:47.830 --> 04:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
which other people have mentioned um
 
04:33:50.470 --> 04:33:50.480 align:start position:0%
because you can't say that
 
04:33:52.709 --> 04:33:52.719 align:start position:0%
there's you know that there's child
 
04:33:55.590 --> 04:33:55.600 align:start position:0%
support and also the right to abort it
 
04:33:58.189 --> 04:33:58.199 align:start position:0%
it those are in conflict with each other
 
04:34:01.670 --> 04:34:01.680 align:start position:0%
we've already mentioned the
 
04:34:04.510 --> 04:34:04.520 align:start position:0%
um sorry I I lost what I was saying we
 
04:34:06.750 --> 04:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
already mentioned issue with paternity
 
04:34:10.551 --> 04:34:10.561 align:start position:0%
but then also um if if we're talking
 
04:34:13.070 --> 04:34:13.080 align:start position:0%
about the medical bills I'm not sure if
 
04:34:15.551 --> 04:34:15.561 align:start position:0%
that's already in standing law I do
 
04:34:16.910 --> 04:34:16.920 align:start position:0%
realize that there's a lot of medical
 
04:34:18.269 --> 04:34:18.279 align:start position:0%
bills but there's also financial
 
04:34:22.150 --> 04:34:22.160 align:start position:0%
assistance available at hospitals if um
 
04:34:24.709 --> 04:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
and they can also deal with that after
 
04:34:26.990 --> 04:34:27.000 align:start position:0%
the birth uh because you don't have to
 
04:34:29.390 --> 04:34:29.400 align:start position:0%
prepay for services you can be on like
 
04:34:34.510 --> 04:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
payment plans so um you know they they
 
04:34:36.310 --> 04:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
could always like deal with that after
 
04:34:39.750 --> 04:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
the fact I believe so I would suggest
 
04:34:42.750 --> 04:34:42.760 align:start position:0%
that a pregnant woman who irrespective
 
04:34:45.789 --> 04:34:45.799 align:start position:0%
of marital status is acting single
 
04:34:47.910 --> 04:34:47.920 align:start position:0%
because with this guy go to has other
 
04:34:50.310 --> 04:34:50.320 align:start position:0%
bills besides medical bills and there's
 
04:34:53.551 --> 04:34:53.561 align:start position:0%
something in me having met at least my
 
04:34:56.470 --> 04:34:56.480 align:start position:0%
share of deadbeat dads who everybody
 
04:35:00.470 --> 04:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
knows who the father is and this uh low
 
04:35:03.390 --> 04:35:03.400 align:start position:0%
life will not lift a finger to help
 
04:35:05.590 --> 04:35:05.600 align:start position:0%
whatsoever I really would not my
 
04:35:07.349 --> 04:35:07.359 align:start position:0%
mechanism that would just grab him and
 
04:35:10.869 --> 04:35:10.879 align:start position:0%
twist him until he's a pretzel
 
04:35:13.750 --> 04:35:13.760 align:start position:0%
um I'm trying to be polite because I I'm
 
04:35:16.310 --> 04:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
thinking far worse than what I just said
 
04:35:19.029 --> 04:35:19.039 align:start position:0%
um but I think it gets complicated in
 
04:35:20.910 --> 04:35:20.920 align:start position:0%
some of the other stuff they're asking
 
04:35:24.310 --> 04:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
for darn it I was hoping we could find a
 
04:35:26.949 --> 04:35:26.959 align:start position:0%
way to make the dead beats pay but I
 
04:35:29.070 --> 04:35:29.080 align:start position:0%
don't think this is the vehicle anybody
 
04:35:31.869 --> 04:35:31.879 align:start position:0%
else there is
 
04:35:31.879 --> 04:35:34.189 align:start position:0%
else there is
side

04:35:34.189 --> 04:35:34.199 align:start position:0%
side
 
04:35:38.551 --> 04:35:38.561 align:start position:0%
hooray you are more fascinated than I
 
04:35:42.470 --> 04:35:42.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:46.189 --> 04:35:46.199 align:start position:0%
you I may it just reminds me of my days
 
04:35:49.390 --> 04:35:49.400 align:start position:0%
when I was sick at home watching the uh
 
04:35:52.789 --> 04:35:52.799 align:start position:0%
whatever Murray show that was the uh oh
 
04:35:52.799 --> 04:35:54.189 align:start position:0%
whatever Murray show that was the uh oh

to it is presented to you if no one
 
04:40:29.110 --> 04:40:29.120 align:start position:0%
wishes to move the amendment the
 
04:40:29.120 --> 04:40:33.708 align:start position:0%
wishes to move the amendment the
amendment

04:40:33.708 --> 04:40:33.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:33.718 --> 04:40:35.310 align:start position:0%
 
dies

04:40:35.310 --> 04:40:35.320 align:start position:0%
dies
 
04:40:39.510 --> 04:40:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:44.750 --> 04:40:44.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:47.350 --> 04:40:47.360 align:start position:0%
B can you put your mic on I couldn't
 
04:40:52.470 --> 04:40:52.480 align:start position:0%
hear you she usually tells me she's
 
04:40:55.910 --> 04:40:55.920 align:start position:0%
busy she's busy writing a blurb well I
 
04:40:57.550 --> 04:40:57.560 align:start position:0%
I'm just say I I think the mo I think
 
04:41:00.788 --> 04:41:00.798 align:start position:0%
it's a better what's your motion ought
 
04:41:02.350 --> 04:41:02.360 align:start position:0%
to pass the amendment the amendment
 
04:41:04.868 --> 04:41:04.878 align:start position:0%
ought to pass is there a second on the
 
04:41:08.708 --> 04:41:08.718 align:start position:0%
Amendment representative Panic just beat
 
04:41:12.070 --> 04:41:12.080 align:start position:0%
you I second the motion ought to pass
 
04:41:14.150 --> 04:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
okay now discussion on the
 
04:41:17.310 --> 04:41:17.320 align:start position:0%
amendment I uh I've been opposed to this
 
04:41:18.830 --> 04:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
right along but mostly it's because of
 
04:41:21.788 --> 04:41:21.798 align:start position:0%
the libraries having the secrecy uh
 
04:41:26.670 --> 04:41:26.680 align:start position:0%
thing um I um we
 
04:41:29.910 --> 04:41:29.920 align:start position:0%
learned that a parent can be in control
 
04:41:32.670 --> 04:41:32.680 align:start position:0%
by just using a family card or their own
 
04:41:36.788 --> 04:41:36.798 align:start position:0%
card uh but if if they are silly enough
 
04:41:40.230 --> 04:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
to not do that and give it to the child
 
04:41:41.430 --> 04:41:41.440 align:start position:0%
I'm beginning to think maybe it's not
 
04:41:43.470 --> 04:41:43.480 align:start position:0%
such a bad idea so I'm willing to listen
 
04:41:48.350 --> 04:41:48.360 align:start position:0%
to to debate as to why not do this why
 
04:41:51.510 --> 04:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
not do what uh the amendment which is
 
04:41:54.030 --> 04:41:54.040 align:start position:0%
which is to give uh parents the right to
 
04:41:56.310 --> 04:41:56.320 align:start position:0%
look at what their children are take
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
records in the library it wouldn't
 
04:42:00.230 --> 04:42:00.240 align:start position:0%
include when they go to the library and
 
04:42:02.030 --> 04:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
look at stuff it would only be when they
 
04:42:05.310 --> 04:42:05.320 align:start position:0%
record uh make a record of something
 
04:42:07.390 --> 04:42:07.400 align:start position:0%
which is generally a library
 
04:42:09.910 --> 04:42:09.920 align:start position:0%
card that's the only thing I think
 
04:42:09.920 --> 04:42:15.708 align:start position:0%
card that's the only thing I think
of

04:42:15.708 --> 04:42:15.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:15.718 --> 04:42:17.670 align:start position:0%
 
Representative

04:42:17.670 --> 04:42:17.680 align:start position:0%
Representative
 
04:42:20.030 --> 04:42:20.040 align:start position:0%
Gibbons thank you Mr chairman I still
 
04:42:22.270 --> 04:42:22.280 align:start position:0%
need a seating chart here sorry yeah no
 
04:42:24.948 --> 04:42:24.958 align:start position:0%
it's okay uh it takes a while to and I
 
04:42:26.830 --> 04:42:26.840 align:start position:0%
and my name plate still hasn't changed
 
04:42:28.788 --> 04:42:28.798 align:start position:0%
so there's that well yeah but you've
 
04:42:31.030 --> 04:42:31.040 align:start position:0%
studied enough gerontology to know that
 
04:42:32.990 --> 04:42:33.000 align:start position:0%
this sort of happens when yeah thank you
 
04:42:35.510 --> 04:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
you're fine go ahead um
 
04:42:38.708 --> 04:42:38.718 align:start position:0%
so here's the here's the thing I
 
04:42:41.270 --> 04:42:41.280 align:start position:0%
understand that the with the family card
 
04:42:45.788 --> 04:42:45.798 align:start position:0%
they can see everything but if a child
 
04:42:48.430 --> 04:42:48.440 align:start position:0%
is or I I should say a minor because
 
04:42:49.788 --> 04:42:49.798 align:start position:0%
this is really going to apply to like
 
04:42:51.750 --> 04:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
the teenagers and stuff if they're
 
04:42:54.110 --> 04:42:54.120 align:start position:0%
really that bent on the parent not
 
04:42:59.190 --> 04:42:59.200 align:start position:0%
seeing what they're accessing in the um
 
04:43:02.270 --> 04:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
in the library just imagine the scenario
 
04:43:05.948 --> 04:43:05.958 align:start position:0%
imagine that you know rep is my daughter
 
04:43:07.948 --> 04:43:07.958 align:start position:0%
and I say here here's my it would take
 
04:43:09.788 --> 04:43:09.798 align:start position:0%
imagination but go ahead she is right
 
04:43:11.550 --> 04:43:11.560 align:start position:0%
next to me so I'm just using her as a
 
04:43:14.910 --> 04:43:14.920 align:start position:0%
prop and she hasn't mine um but you know
 
04:43:16.868 --> 04:43:16.878 align:start position:0%
if I say here's the family card and she
 
04:43:19.390 --> 04:43:19.400 align:start position:0%
goes and takes it there's nothing
 
04:43:21.430 --> 04:43:21.440 align:start position:0%
mandating that she actually uses it she
 
04:43:23.590 --> 04:43:23.600 align:start position:0%
can go to the library and just kind of
 
04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
have this in her you know purse or
 
04:43:28.590 --> 04:43:28.600 align:start position:0%
whatever and just open her own library
 
04:43:32.470 --> 04:43:32.480 align:start position:0%
card so and then if I questioned like oh
 
04:43:33.868 --> 04:43:33.878 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like you took anything
 
04:43:37.670 --> 04:43:37.680 align:start position:0%
out she can be like nope and there's
 
04:43:39.470 --> 04:43:39.480 align:start position:0%
nothing guaranteeing that they're going
 
04:43:41.030 --> 04:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
to to
 
04:43:43.990 --> 04:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
use the family card just because I
 
04:43:46.788 --> 04:43:46.798 align:start position:0%
provide it to them so why would we even
 
04:43:48.670 --> 04:43:48.680 align:start position:0%
bother with this
 
04:43:51.510 --> 04:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
spill representative long I'm still
 
04:43:53.350 --> 04:43:53.360 align:start position:0%
getting my mind thank you Mr chairman uh
 
04:43:56.628 --> 04:43:56.638 align:start position:0%
so there's 234 libraries each of them
 
04:43:59.430 --> 04:43:59.440 align:start position:0%
have their own governing body so this is
 
04:44:01.550 --> 04:44:01.560 align:start position:0%
an issue for that governing body if I'm
 
04:44:03.310 --> 04:44:03.320 align:start position:0%
living in Manchester and I don't like
 
04:44:04.990 --> 04:44:05.000 align:start position:0%
something then I'm going to go to my
 
04:44:06.628 --> 04:44:06.638 align:start position:0%
library and I'm going to say I have an
 
04:44:08.150 --> 04:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
issue I'm going to go to my Alderman or
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
whatever and say I have an issue with uh
 
04:44:15.070 --> 04:44:15.080 align:start position:0%
not getting uh a book that my son is a
 
04:44:16.670 --> 04:44:16.680 align:start position:0%
year behind is a
 
04:44:20.948 --> 04:44:20.958 align:start position:0%
year uh over and bringing it back I you
 
04:44:23.590 --> 04:44:23.600 align:start position:0%
know this is not I in my opinion I don't
 
04:44:25.990 --> 04:44:26.000 align:start position:0%
think this is a state issue I think it's
 
04:44:28.590 --> 04:44:28.600 align:start position:0%
a governing body for each particular
 
04:44:30.670 --> 04:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
library that would be Trustees for the
 
04:44:33.390 --> 04:44:33.400 align:start position:0%
library correct yeah representative
 
04:44:33.400 --> 04:44:35.150 align:start position:0%
library correct yeah representative
panic

04:44:35.150 --> 04:44:35.160 align:start position:0%
panic
 
04:44:38.030 --> 04:44:38.040 align:start position:0%
um I respectfully disagree with you
 
04:44:42.430 --> 04:44:42.440 align:start position:0%
representative long and um South
 
04:44:46.990 --> 04:44:47.000 align:start position:0%
Carolina has um cut their ties with the
 
04:44:49.110 --> 04:44:49.120 align:start position:0%
American Library
 
04:44:52.868 --> 04:44:52.878 align:start position:0%
Association and so has it Montana and
 
04:44:58.430 --> 04:44:58.440 align:start position:0%
Texas and the reason being is that
 
04:45:03.110 --> 04:45:03.120 align:start position:0%
um parents are not being given access to
 
04:45:05.350 --> 04:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
their minor children children's reading
 
04:45:08.788 --> 04:45:08.798 align:start position:0%
material they are told to monitor the
 
04:45:13.030 --> 04:45:13.040 align:start position:0%
internet on what they're seeing
 
04:45:15.868 --> 04:45:15.878 align:start position:0%
online but when it comes to monitoring
 
04:45:18.470 --> 04:45:18.480 align:start position:0%
what kind of books they're taking out
 
04:45:20.910 --> 04:45:20.920 align:start position:0%
it's a big secret and this is the reason
 
04:45:23.670 --> 04:45:23.680 align:start position:0%
why they're cutting ties with the Ala
 
04:45:28.310 --> 04:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
it's the Ala that is directing the
 
04:45:31.590 --> 04:45:31.600 align:start position:0%
libraries what to
 
04:45:35.270 --> 04:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
do and the problem
 
04:45:38.110 --> 04:45:38.120 align:start position:0%
is we have a lot of
 
04:45:40.310 --> 04:45:40.320 align:start position:0%
pornography that is
 
04:45:44.230 --> 04:45:44.240 align:start position:0%
being put into
 
04:45:48.430 --> 04:45:48.440 align:start position:0%
the children's library and the kids have
 
04:45:52.110 --> 04:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
access to stuff that should be adult
 
04:45:54.990 --> 04:45:55.000 align:start position:0%
content and I don't think it's the
 
04:45:57.310 --> 04:45:57.320 align:start position:0%
government's business or the ala's
 
04:45:59.350 --> 04:45:59.360 align:start position:0%
business or our public libraries
 
04:46:02.070 --> 04:46:02.080 align:start position:0%
business to be putting thems in a
 
04:46:04.910 --> 04:46:04.920 align:start position:0%
situation to be teaching our minor
 
04:46:07.030 --> 04:46:07.040 align:start position:0%
children about the birds and the bees
 
04:46:09.510 --> 04:46:09.520 align:start position:0%
that's stripping away a parental right
 
04:46:12.070 --> 04:46:12.080 align:start position:0%
and I believe that a parent has the
 
04:46:16.430 --> 04:46:16.440 align:start position:0%
right to determine what would be
 
04:46:20.150 --> 04:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate for that child's age
 
04:46:24.190 --> 04:46:24.200 align:start position:0%
category and to representative Gibbons I
 
04:46:26.030 --> 04:46:26.040 align:start position:0%
don't think a child a minor child can
 
04:46:28.830 --> 04:46:28.840 align:start position:0%
take out their own library card without
 
04:46:31.670 --> 04:46:31.680 align:start position:0%
a parental signature am I correct about
 
04:46:34.948 --> 04:46:34.958 align:start position:0%
that representative long
 
04:46:37.510 --> 04:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh so again a
 
04:46:40.150 --> 04:46:40.160 align:start position:0%
library is not a babysitting facility so
 
04:46:41.910 --> 04:46:41.920 align:start position:0%
if I don't trust my kid what they're
 
04:46:44.548 --> 04:46:44.558 align:start position:0%
doing in the library I'm not sending the
 
04:46:48.430 --> 04:46:48.440 align:start position:0%
child to the library it's it's that
 
04:46:50.948 --> 04:46:50.958 align:start position:0%
simple you know I'm gonna I'm going to
 
04:46:52.948 --> 04:46:52.958 align:start position:0%
look for places for my child to go but
 
04:46:55.310 --> 04:46:55.320 align:start position:0%
however I want them to video and monitor
 
04:46:57.430 --> 04:46:57.440 align:start position:0%
him and give me every everything you
 
04:46:59.470 --> 04:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
know about him no that's my
 
04:47:01.310 --> 04:47:01.320 align:start position:0%
responsibility if there's something I'm
 
04:47:03.350 --> 04:47:03.360 align:start position:0%
not going to know about them then that
 
04:47:05.030 --> 04:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
that child's not going going
 
04:47:09.830 --> 04:47:09.840 align:start position:0%
there anyone else representative Greg
 
04:47:12.110 --> 04:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman so on this subject
 
04:47:15.110 --> 04:47:15.120 align:start position:0%
and and you know back to the babysitters
 
04:47:16.590 --> 04:47:16.600 align:start position:0%
and the parents and all that this is the
 
04:47:18.230 --> 04:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
conversation that you have with your
 
04:47:21.150 --> 04:47:21.160 align:start position:0%
children part of a par parental right is
 
04:47:22.510 --> 04:47:22.520 align:start position:0%
to be able to have a conversation with
 
04:47:23.910 --> 04:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
your child about what they're reading
 
04:47:26.390 --> 04:47:26.400 align:start position:0%
and what they're doing not to oversee
 
04:47:28.670 --> 04:47:28.680 align:start position:0%
them like the FBI and go behind their
 
04:47:29.948 --> 04:47:29.958 align:start position:0%
back and say I'm going to look at your
 
04:47:31.510 --> 04:47:31.520 align:start position:0%
records and stuff we should be having
 
04:47:33.548 --> 04:47:33.558 align:start position:0%
those conversations but another
 
04:47:36.030 --> 04:47:36.040 align:start position:0%
complication in a bill like this is our
 
04:47:38.070 --> 04:47:38.080 align:start position:0%
libraries are not set up to be able to
 
04:47:40.830 --> 04:47:40.840 align:start position:0%
even handle this kind of a a demand on
 
04:47:42.470 --> 04:47:42.480 align:start position:0%
them and I'm not sure where the money
 
04:47:44.390 --> 04:47:44.400 align:start position:0%
would come from for this kind of a a
 
04:47:46.190 --> 04:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
mandate for them to do something like
 
04:47:47.990 --> 04:47:48.000 align:start position:0%
this even though I I find it
 
04:47:49.350 --> 04:47:49.360 align:start position:0%
inappropriate in the beginning because
 
04:47:53.230 --> 04:47:53.240 align:start position:0%
it is a locally um local thing that they
 
04:47:55.150 --> 04:47:55.160 align:start position:0%
do not a state thing but anyway there's
 
04:47:56.948 --> 04:47:56.958 align:start position:0%
so many complications to this bill and
 
04:48:00.110 --> 04:48:00.120 align:start position:0%
so many reasons why this is a bad idea
 
04:48:03.470 --> 04:48:03.480 align:start position:0%
I'll I'm I'm in favor of itl on this
 
04:48:06.868 --> 04:48:06.878 align:start position:0%
represent ative Nelson thank you Mr
 
04:48:06.878 --> 04:48:08.628 align:start position:0%
represent ative Nelson thank you Mr
chairman

04:48:08.628 --> 04:48:08.638 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
04:48:13.430 --> 04:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
um we've heard and here and I've heard
 
04:48:17.910 --> 04:48:17.920 align:start position:0%
um that um libraries have all sorts of
 
04:48:21.030 --> 04:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
um databases and there are a lot of
 
04:48:26.030 --> 04:48:26.040 align:start position:0%
libraries who um do not have uh the
 
04:48:31.990 --> 04:48:32.000 align:start position:0%
capabilities to go back in time and um
 
04:48:34.548 --> 04:48:34.558 align:start position:0%
the section
 
04:48:38.430 --> 04:48:38.440 align:start position:0%
uh on line five um section 2A all
 
04:48:42.750 --> 04:48:42.760 align:start position:0%
Library records um is a problem because
 
04:48:47.150 --> 04:48:47.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't give us a specific time frame
 
04:48:50.708 --> 04:48:50.718 align:start position:0%
for that um so that's one of the
 
04:48:53.110 --> 04:48:53.120 align:start position:0%
problems that I have with the Bill thank
 
04:48:55.548 --> 04:48:55.558 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
04:48:58.030 --> 04:48:58.040 align:start position:0%
Petrino thank you Mr chairman during
 
04:49:01.590 --> 04:49:01.600 align:start position:0%
testimony I raised the question so if a
 
04:49:03.750 --> 04:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
child doesn't want their parents to know
 
04:49:05.910 --> 04:49:05.920 align:start position:0%
what they're taking out from the library
 
04:49:07.670 --> 04:49:07.680 align:start position:0%
there's nothing that stops a child from
 
04:49:09.470 --> 04:49:09.480 align:start position:0%
going down the aisles and taking a book
 
04:49:11.430 --> 04:49:11.440 align:start position:0%
off the shelf and sitting in a corner
 
04:49:13.430 --> 04:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
and reading for 20 minutes without the
 
04:49:16.548 --> 04:49:16.558 align:start position:0%
parent even knowing so I mean in that
 
04:49:18.470 --> 04:49:18.480 align:start position:0%
sense if I know that Mom and Dad are
 
04:49:20.548 --> 04:49:20.558 align:start position:0%
checking on what I'm reading guess what
 
04:49:23.190 --> 04:49:23.200 align:start position:0%
I'm never going to take the book out and
 
04:49:24.470 --> 04:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
parents actually should be happy that
 
04:49:25.590 --> 04:49:25.600 align:start position:0%
kids have library cards and they're
 
04:49:27.190 --> 04:49:27.200 align:start position:0%
going to the library in the first place
 
04:49:30.070 --> 04:49:30.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:32.910 --> 04:49:32.920 align:start position:0%
reading representative
 
04:49:32.920 --> 04:49:35.110 align:start position:0%
reading representative
LC

04:49:35.110 --> 04:49:35.120 align:start position:0%
LC
 
04:49:38.350 --> 04:49:38.360 align:start position:0%
I'm pretty young when and I kind of
 
04:49:40.708 --> 04:49:40.718 align:start position:0%
remember my mom and my dad taking me to
 
04:49:43.788 --> 04:49:43.798 align:start position:0%
the library and actually having full-on
 
04:49:46.990 --> 04:49:47.000 align:start position:0%
discussions of what is appropriate and
 
04:49:48.548 --> 04:49:48.558 align:start position:0%
what's not when I would bring him a book
 
04:49:50.510 --> 04:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to read and they would my
 
04:49:52.708 --> 04:49:52.718 align:start position:0%
mom would sit down and read the back at
 
04:49:54.830 --> 04:49:54.840 align:start position:0%
least and skim it and she'd be like okay
 
04:49:57.628 --> 04:49:57.638 align:start position:0%
this is why it's not I don't feel it's
 
04:50:00.310 --> 04:50:00.320 align:start position:0%
at your age level go find another book
 
04:50:02.750 --> 04:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
and she'd be finding a book that she
 
04:50:04.670 --> 04:50:04.680 align:start position:0%
wants to read while I'm over in the kids
 
04:50:07.628 --> 04:50:07.638 align:start position:0%
section and she's with me my parents are
 
04:50:10.070 --> 04:50:10.080 align:start position:0%
with me every time you go to the library
 
04:50:13.310 --> 04:50:13.320 align:start position:0%
you can't just leave your kid unattended
 
04:50:15.590 --> 04:50:15.600 align:start position:0%
to go wandering the library they have to
 
04:50:18.510 --> 04:50:18.520 align:start position:0%
have an adult somewhere in the library
 
04:50:20.948 --> 04:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
you are you see a kid anywhere and
 
04:50:23.310 --> 04:50:23.320 align:start position:0%
you're like where's your parents where's
 
04:50:25.708 --> 04:50:25.718 align:start position:0%
your mom and dad and they say right over
 
04:50:28.110 --> 04:50:28.120 align:start position:0%
there then you're like oh okay it's
 
04:50:30.030 --> 04:50:30.040 align:start position:0%
great if they say my parents are at the
 
04:50:30.040 --> 04:50:30.948 align:start position:0%
great if they say my parents are at the
grocery

04:50:30.948 --> 04:50:30.958 align:start position:0%
grocery
 
04:50:34.628 --> 04:50:34.638 align:start position:0%
store that's kind of problematic for any
 
04:50:38.390 --> 04:50:38.400 align:start position:0%
adult in that situation of like okay can
 
04:50:41.390 --> 04:50:41.400 align:start position:0%
you call them and get them here
 
04:50:44.190 --> 04:50:44.200 align:start position:0%
or uh if they don't show up in the next
 
04:50:45.670 --> 04:50:45.680 align:start position:0%
30 minutes we're going to call the
 
04:50:49.350 --> 04:50:49.360 align:start position:0%
police because you are an attended child
 
04:50:51.868 --> 04:50:51.878 align:start position:0%
and that's the whatever protocol that
 
04:50:53.390 --> 04:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
they have to
 
04:50:56.350 --> 04:50:56.360 align:start position:0%
follow representative D
 
04:50:59.670 --> 04:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
Simon thank you Mr
 
04:51:02.430 --> 04:51:02.440 align:start position:0%
chairman I think the concept of this
 
04:51:04.548 --> 04:51:04.558 align:start position:0%
bill is
 
04:51:08.910 --> 04:51:08.920 align:start position:0%
awesome I truly do however I think this
 
04:51:10.390 --> 04:51:10.400 align:start position:0%
is the wrong
 
04:51:12.350 --> 04:51:12.360 align:start position:0%
place there are
 
04:51:17.030 --> 04:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
234 libraries in this state none of us
 
04:51:20.910 --> 04:51:20.920 align:start position:0%
know what capabilities all those 234
 
04:51:20.920 --> 04:51:22.390 align:start position:0%
know what capabilities all those 234
libraries

04:51:22.390 --> 04:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
libraries
 
04:51:25.830 --> 04:51:25.840 align:start position:0%
have none of us know how much funding
 
04:51:27.708 --> 04:51:27.718 align:start position:0%
those libraries
 
04:51:30.788 --> 04:51:30.798 align:start position:0%
have and none of us know what those
 
04:51:30.798 --> 04:51:32.750 align:start position:0%
have and none of us know what those
particular

04:51:32.750 --> 04:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:51:32.760 --> 04:51:34.390 align:start position:0%
particular
communities

04:51:34.390 --> 04:51:34.400 align:start position:0%
communities
 
04:51:38.390 --> 04:51:38.400 align:start position:0%
mindset toward what children can and
 
04:51:42.190 --> 04:51:42.200 align:start position:0%
cannot take out and the
 
04:51:45.590 --> 04:51:45.600 align:start position:0%
parents involvement with those
 
04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
children I I do like the concept of the
 
04:51:52.670 --> 04:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
bill but I think that it should be a
 
04:51:56.430 --> 04:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
municipal warrant article for each
 
04:51:59.708 --> 04:51:59.718 align:start position:0%
individual Community to deal with in
 
04:52:01.628 --> 04:52:01.638 align:start position:0%
their own
 
04:52:04.990 --> 04:52:05.000 align:start position:0%
Community taking into cons consideration
 
04:52:08.708 --> 04:52:08.718 align:start position:0%
the financial constraints the Staffing
 
04:52:17.750 --> 04:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:20.310 --> 04:52:20.320 align:start position:0%
involvement which one am I the chair
 
04:52:25.310 --> 04:52:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:28.030 --> 04:52:28.040 align:start position:0%
daughter thanks Mom thank you Mr
 
04:52:30.868 --> 04:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
chairman um just uh I forgot where I was
 
04:52:32.910 --> 04:52:32.920 align:start position:0%
you got bra on the daughter's not
 
04:52:34.390 --> 04:52:34.400 align:start position:0%
thinking straight
 
04:52:37.150 --> 04:52:37.160 align:start position:0%
um what we're finding what what we found
 
04:52:40.708 --> 04:52:40.718 align:start position:0%
in our town is the on a local level the
 
04:52:42.948 --> 04:52:42.958 align:start position:0%
library trustees are not listening to
 
04:52:44.830 --> 04:52:44.840 align:start position:0%
the people that are complaining about
 
04:52:47.110 --> 04:52:47.120 align:start position:0%
what is going on within their Library so
 
04:52:47.120 --> 04:52:47.830 align:start position:0%
what is going on within their Library so
I

04:52:47.830 --> 04:52:47.840 align:start position:0%
I
 
04:52:51.030 --> 04:52:51.040 align:start position:0%
agree that we want to keep it in in the
 
04:52:52.990 --> 04:52:53.000 align:start position:0%
municipalities but what do you do when
 
04:52:54.670 --> 04:52:54.680 align:start position:0%
when the trustees the people that are in
 
04:52:55.830 --> 04:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
charge of it aren't listening and
 
04:52:57.350 --> 04:52:57.360 align:start position:0%
they're still promoting and pushing
 
04:52:59.430 --> 04:52:59.440 align:start position:0%
right in the front row of the kids are
 
04:53:01.390 --> 04:53:01.400 align:start position:0%
seeing it every time that to
 
04:53:03.708 --> 04:53:03.718 align:start position:0%
representative panic's comment on the
 
04:53:05.670 --> 04:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
obscene materials that should not be in
 
04:53:07.310 --> 04:53:07.320 align:start position:0%
front of a child and they are right
 
04:53:09.390 --> 04:53:09.400 align:start position:0%
there when you enter the the the grounds
 
04:53:11.110 --> 04:53:11.120 align:start position:0%
or enter a room that that is not off
 
04:53:13.708 --> 04:53:13.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:53:17.310 --> 04:53:17.320 align:start position:0%
child Mr chairman I would like
 
04:53:20.990 --> 04:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
representative deimon thank you I think
 
04:53:23.430 --> 04:53:23.440 align:start position:0%
that in that case if you had a warrant
 
04:53:25.750 --> 04:53:25.760 align:start position:0%
article that was passed in your
 
04:53:28.150 --> 04:53:28.160 align:start position:0%
municipality then you go to the library
 
04:53:31.230 --> 04:53:31.240 align:start position:0%
and say excuse me librarian there is a
 
04:53:34.230 --> 04:53:34.240 align:start position:0%
town ordinance or city ordinance that
 
04:53:37.590 --> 04:53:37.600 align:start position:0%
says that you have to provide me this
 
04:53:37.600 --> 04:53:40.030 align:start position:0%
says that you have to provide me this
information

04:53:40.030 --> 04:53:40.040 align:start position:0%
information
 
04:53:43.350 --> 04:53:43.360 align:start position:0%
otherwise that I just again I don't want
 
04:53:47.150 --> 04:53:47.160 align:start position:0%
to put libraries in a position where we
 
04:53:49.788 --> 04:53:49.798 align:start position:0%
are legislating them to spend more money
 
04:53:53.310 --> 04:53:53.320 align:start position:0%
than what they have and try to hire the
 
04:53:57.070 --> 04:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
staff that they can't afford to hire yet
 
04:54:00.510 --> 04:54:00.520 align:start position:0%
another Community can hire that staff
 
04:54:04.708 --> 04:54:04.718 align:start position:0%
another Community can put in all of
 
04:54:07.830 --> 04:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
what is necessary to monitor I'm all for
 
04:54:11.990 --> 04:54:12.000 align:start position:0%
monitoring those kids absolutely 100%
 
04:54:14.030 --> 04:54:14.040 align:start position:0%
and we'll work with the sponsor of this
 
04:54:18.910 --> 04:54:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill to um if this does not pass I will
 
04:54:21.310 --> 04:54:21.320 align:start position:0%
work with her to write uh a warrant
 
04:54:25.430 --> 04:54:25.440 align:start position:0%
article for next year's um town meeting
 
04:54:27.830 --> 04:54:27.840 align:start position:0%
and get this passed in our
 
04:54:30.150 --> 04:54:30.160 align:start position:0%
community representative
 
04:54:33.270 --> 04:54:33.280 align:start position:0%
Raymond um thank you and I just want to
 
04:54:35.548 --> 04:54:35.558 align:start position:0%
point point out that libraries are
 
04:54:39.470 --> 04:54:39.480 align:start position:0%
public facilities akin to a museum we
 
04:54:41.868 --> 04:54:41.878 align:start position:0%
would never drop off a child at a mum
 
04:54:43.990 --> 04:54:44.000 align:start position:0%
and let them run around without parental
 
04:54:46.830 --> 04:54:46.840 align:start position:0%
supervision it is the obligation of
 
04:54:50.548 --> 04:54:50.558 align:start position:0%
parents to guide their children to
 
04:54:53.708 --> 04:54:53.718 align:start position:0%
activities media and books that are
 
04:54:55.430 --> 04:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
developmentally appropriate for their
 
04:54:58.590 --> 04:54:58.600 align:start position:0%
own child it is not the responsibility
 
04:55:01.030 --> 04:55:01.040 align:start position:0%
of the library staff any more than it
 
04:55:02.910 --> 04:55:02.920 align:start position:0%
would be the responsibility of a museum
 
04:55:05.750 --> 04:55:05.760 align:start position:0%
staff to censor what they offer the
 
04:55:08.150 --> 04:55:08.160 align:start position:0%
public it is the parents job to
 
04:55:10.270 --> 04:55:10.280 align:start position:0%
supervise their child and if your child
 
04:55:12.590 --> 04:55:12.600 align:start position:0%
is not developmentally able to follow
 
04:55:15.150 --> 04:55:15.160 align:start position:0%
your family values then they are not
 
04:55:17.750 --> 04:55:17.760 align:start position:0%
developmentally able to be in a place
 
04:55:20.310 --> 04:55:20.320 align:start position:0%
without supervision that's I mean that's
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
the bottom line and that's a parenting
 
04:55:22.718 --> 04:55:25.948 align:start position:0%
the bottom line and that's a parenting
decision

04:55:25.948 --> 04:55:25.958 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:29.750 --> 04:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
so representative

Perez thank
 
04:55:35.868 --> 04:55:35.878 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair for to speak I agree with
 
04:55:39.548 --> 04:55:39.558 align:start position:0%
uh representative dong
 
04:55:43.270 --> 04:55:43.280 align:start position:0%
um just to put an example our library in
 
04:55:45.470 --> 04:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
Milford is falling apart we don't even
 
04:55:48.548 --> 04:55:48.558 align:start position:0%
have enough money to fix the
 
04:55:50.590 --> 04:55:50.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure issues with the public
 
04:55:53.270 --> 04:55:53.280 align:start position:0%
library in Mur might as well putting
 
04:55:55.948 --> 04:55:55.958 align:start position:0%
more burning into spend money and other
 
04:55:58.510 --> 04:55:58.520 align:start position:0%
issues that we don't really if the
 
04:56:00.590 --> 04:56:00.600 align:start position:0%
parents already have you know if the
 
04:56:02.590 --> 04:56:02.600 align:start position:0%
parents spending already enough time
 
04:56:03.910 --> 04:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
with the children when they go to the
 
04:56:07.030 --> 04:56:07.040 align:start position:0%
library we should not be needing these
 
04:56:09.390 --> 04:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
kind of bills here at the child and
 
04:56:12.270 --> 04:56:12.280 align:start position:0%
family La committee thank you
 
04:56:12.280 --> 04:56:13.590 align:start position:0%
family La committee thank you
representative

04:56:13.590 --> 04:56:13.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:56:16.948 --> 04:56:16.958 align:start position:0%
panic I don't see in this bill or the
 
04:56:18.910 --> 04:56:18.920 align:start position:0%
amendment um are we talking on the
 
04:56:20.470 --> 04:56:20.480 align:start position:0%
amendment or the bill you're talking
 
04:56:22.990 --> 04:56:23.000 align:start position:0%
about the amendment I don't see anything
 
04:56:26.390 --> 04:56:26.400 align:start position:0%
in the amendment or the bill that would
 
04:56:27.628 --> 04:56:27.638 align:start position:0%
be in an
 
04:56:30.750 --> 04:56:30.760 align:start position:0%
additional financial burden to the
 
04:56:34.190 --> 04:56:34.200 align:start position:0%
community or the library when when
 
04:56:34.200 --> 04:56:37.868 align:start position:0%
community or the library when when
representative

04:56:37.868 --> 04:56:37.878 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:42.548 --> 04:56:42.558 align:start position:0%
um quo I can't say your name correctly
 
04:56:46.390 --> 04:56:46.400 align:start position:0%
the reason what she brought this bill up
 
04:56:46.400 --> 04:56:47.230 align:start position:0%
the reason what she brought this bill up
is

04:56:47.230 --> 04:56:47.240 align:start position:0%
is
 
04:56:52.470 --> 04:56:52.480 align:start position:0%
because when the parents would get a
 
04:56:55.788 --> 04:56:55.798 align:start position:0%
overdue notice from the library the
 
04:56:57.910 --> 04:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
library was not
 
04:57:01.788 --> 04:57:01.798 align:start position:0%
allowing does not allow the librarian to
 
04:57:04.830 --> 04:57:04.840 align:start position:0%
tell the parent what book is
 
04:57:08.390 --> 04:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
overdue so all this does is lift the
 
04:57:12.470 --> 04:57:12.480 align:start position:0%
veil and you know I I don't see how that
 
04:57:15.350 --> 04:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
would be an additional financial burden
 
04:57:18.510 --> 04:57:18.520 align:start position:0%
and if this material this pornography is
 
04:57:19.470 --> 04:57:19.480 align:start position:0%
in the
 
04:57:22.830 --> 04:57:22.840 align:start position:0%
libraries I don't understand in the
 
04:57:22.840 --> 04:57:24.270 align:start position:0%
libraries I don't understand in the
children's

04:57:24.270 --> 04:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
children's
 
04:57:27.510 --> 04:57:27.520 align:start position:0%
section and sexual hypersexualizing our
 
04:57:30.788 --> 04:57:30.798 align:start position:0%
children at an early age I don't
 
04:57:33.430 --> 04:57:33.440 align:start position:0%
understand why everybody is okay with
 
04:57:33.440 --> 04:57:34.470 align:start position:0%
understand why everybody is okay with
this

04:57:34.470 --> 04:57:34.480 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:57:38.628 --> 04:57:38.638 align:start position:0%
I we're robbing our youth of their
 
04:57:41.590 --> 04:57:41.600 align:start position:0%
childhood of their innocence and what is
 
04:57:43.750 --> 04:57:43.760 align:start position:0%
the point of that what do we gain out of
 
04:57:46.310 --> 04:57:46.320 align:start position:0%
that and that's what I and I'm really
 
04:57:49.030 --> 04:57:49.040 align:start position:0%
upset to see
 
04:57:51.190 --> 04:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
that this is
 
04:57:54.270 --> 04:57:54.280 align:start position:0%
continuing to be able to go on and I
 
04:57:56.750 --> 04:57:56.760 align:start position:0%
think South
 
04:58:01.230 --> 04:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
Carolina and um Texas and Montana are
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
doing the right thing by stopping them
 
04:58:06.470 --> 04:58:06.480 align:start position:0%
and I think we ought to get in line with
 
04:58:08.990 --> 04:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
with this that's all I have to say
 
04:58:09.000 --> 04:58:10.750 align:start position:0%
with this that's all I have to say
presentative

04:58:10.750 --> 04:58:10.760 align:start position:0%
presentative
 
04:58:13.708 --> 04:58:13.718 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman I
 
04:58:16.510 --> 04:58:16.520 align:start position:0%
absolutely am not in favor of providing
 
04:58:18.948 --> 04:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
an appropriate material or pornography
 
04:58:21.990 --> 04:58:22.000 align:start position:0%
to Children uh I have
 
04:58:24.270 --> 04:58:24.280 align:start position:0%
heard um from
 
04:58:27.548 --> 04:58:27.558 align:start position:0%
libraries and we I think we have in
 
04:58:27.558 --> 04:58:28.510 align:start position:0%
libraries and we I think we have in
written

04:58:28.510 --> 04:58:28.520 align:start position:0%
written
 
04:58:34.230 --> 04:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
testimony that in order to provide um um
 
04:58:36.910 --> 04:58:36.920 align:start position:0%
this information that libraries will
 
04:58:39.430 --> 04:58:39.440 align:start position:0%
have to expand their database in one way
 
04:58:43.350 --> 04:58:43.360 align:start position:0%
or another and that is what would be one
 
04:58:45.868 --> 04:58:45.878 align:start position:0%
of the things that would be costing
 
04:58:50.150 --> 04:58:50.160 align:start position:0%
money and um the therefore this actually
 
04:58:54.230 --> 04:58:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
mandate representative
 
04:59:01.070 --> 04:59:01.080 align:start position:0%
Raymond um I was going to point out uh
 
04:59:03.110 --> 04:59:03.120 align:start position:0%
what representative Nelson said so I
 
04:59:05.070 --> 04:59:05.080 align:start position:0%
appreciate that um and the other thing I
 
04:59:09.390 --> 04:59:09.400 align:start position:0%
will say is again we cannot replace
 
04:59:13.868 --> 04:59:13.878 align:start position:0%
supervision of kids with government
 
04:59:15.868 --> 04:59:15.878 align:start position:0%
surveillance if you want to know what
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
your child is reading you need to be
 
04:59:19.510 --> 04:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
there with them when they check it out
 
04:59:20.868 --> 04:59:20.878 align:start position:0%
and you need to be able to have these
 
04:59:22.510 --> 04:59:22.520 align:start position:0%
conversations and I say this as a parent
 
04:59:24.590 --> 04:59:24.600 align:start position:0%
of teenagers I know what my kids are
 
04:59:25.830 --> 04:59:25.840 align:start position:0%
reading I've known what they've been
 
04:59:27.708 --> 04:59:27.718 align:start position:0%
reading since they were children and
 
04:59:30.310 --> 04:59:30.320 align:start position:0%
there are children's library books that
 
04:59:32.470 --> 04:59:32.480 align:start position:0%
different people disagree about the
 
04:59:32.480 --> 04:59:33.788 align:start position:0%
different people disagree about the
appropriate

04:59:33.788 --> 04:59:33.798 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
and that's okay it's okay for different
 
04:59:38.670 --> 04:59:38.680 align:start position:0%
families and different individuals to
 
04:59:41.030 --> 04:59:41.040 align:start position:0%
have differing opinions on what is
 
04:59:43.990 --> 04:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate for their own
 
04:59:48.750 --> 04:59:48.760 align:start position:0%
child so having said that what I allow
 
04:59:51.030 --> 04:59:51.040 align:start position:0%
my child to read may not be what another
 
04:59:52.670 --> 04:59:52.680 align:start position:0%
parent wants their child to read and
 
04:59:55.270 --> 04:59:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's okay but it is not the library's
 
04:59:57.350 --> 04:59:57.360 align:start position:0%
responsibility to Monitor and make those
 
04:59:59.070 --> 04:59:59.080 align:start position:0%
decisions it's the parents
 
05:00:01.070 --> 05:00:01.080 align:start position:0%
responsibility and if you have very
 
05:00:03.830 --> 05:00:03.840 align:start position:0%
strong feelings if you genuinely believe
 
05:00:06.230 --> 05:00:06.240 align:start position:0%
that there is pornography in the library
 
05:00:08.070 --> 05:00:08.080 align:start position:0%
then you should not be allowing your
 
05:00:10.708 --> 05:00:10.718 align:start position:0%
child to access the materials without
 
05:00:14.270 --> 05:00:14.280 align:start position:0%
your guidance and supervision if your
 
05:00:16.070 --> 05:00:16.080 align:start position:0%
child is bringing home library books
 
05:00:17.590 --> 05:00:17.600 align:start position:0%
you're not aware of what they checked
 
05:00:19.628 --> 05:00:19.638 align:start position:0%
out how many books they have whether
 
05:00:21.990 --> 05:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
it's gotten lost then your failing in
 
05:00:24.230 --> 05:00:24.240 align:start position:0%
your responsibility as a parent to
 
05:00:26.788 --> 05:00:26.798 align:start position:0%
provide adequate supervision to your
 
05:00:29.190 --> 05:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
child that's the bottom line I mean we
 
05:00:31.390 --> 05:00:31.400 align:start position:0%
have to hold parents to a standard of
 
05:00:35.030 --> 05:00:35.040 align:start position:0%
parenting here not the
 
05:00:38.590 --> 05:00:38.600 align:start position:0%
government representative sidel's mother
 
05:00:41.470 --> 05:00:41.480 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
05:00:44.390 --> 05:00:44.400 align:start position:0%
um uh I should make a list of how many
 
05:00:45.830 --> 05:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
different nicknames I'm getting in this
 
05:00:48.750 --> 05:00:48.760 align:start position:0%
session but anyway
 
05:00:52.548 --> 05:00:52.558 align:start position:0%
um I just want to say I think it's a bit
 
05:00:55.628 --> 05:00:55.638 align:start position:0%
disrespectful to the libraries to say
 
05:00:57.670 --> 05:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
that there's pornography in the
 
05:01:00.310 --> 05:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
children's section because that's not
 
05:01:04.788 --> 05:01:04.798 align:start position:0%
the case um porn Ry is an actual
 
05:01:07.830 --> 05:01:07.840 align:start position:0%
classification of books you're
 
05:01:10.310 --> 05:01:10.320 align:start position:0%
not I'm just saying don't even don't
 
05:01:10.320 --> 05:01:31.830 align:start position:0%
not I'm just saying don't even don't
even

05:01:31.830 --> 05:01:31.840 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.840 --> 05:01:51.070 align:start position:0%
 
say

05:01:51.070 --> 05:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:53.470 --> 05:01:53.480 align:start position:0%
I'm just my point is just that that's a
 
05:01:53.480 --> 05:01:54.990 align:start position:0%
I'm just my point is just that that's a
specific

05:01:54.990 --> 05:01:55.000 align:start position:0%
specific
 
05:01:57.430 --> 05:01:57.440 align:start position:0%
genre and that's not in the children's
 
05:02:01.750 --> 05:02:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:01.760 --> 05:02:05.750 align:start position:0%
 
the

05:02:05.750 --> 05:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:08.110 --> 05:02:08.120 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move the question I think
 
05:02:12.788 --> 05:02:12.798 align:start position:0%
we are kicking this to death um so the
 
05:02:15.310 --> 05:02:15.320 align:start position:0%
question before us is on the
 
05:02:15.320 --> 05:02:17.070 align:start position:0%

and introduce yes this for us this is an
 
05:08:18.788 --> 05:08:18.798 align:start position:0%
exact session correct so this amendment
 
05:08:22.110 --> 05:08:22.120 align:start position:0%
that I uh presented to you uh if you
 
05:08:24.628 --> 05:08:24.638 align:start position:0%
remember when I introduced the bill I
 
05:08:28.350 --> 05:08:28.360 align:start position:0%
told you that uh chairman Pearson got me
 
05:08:33.510 --> 05:08:33.520 align:start position:0%
in touch with a lawyer who um um her
 
05:08:36.150 --> 05:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
name is Aon KGAN she represents the
 
05:08:41.868 --> 05:08:41.878 align:start position:0%
court symptoms symptoms uh systems sorry
 
05:08:46.270 --> 05:08:46.280 align:start position:0%
and I know right and she I was waiting
 
05:08:47.868 --> 05:08:47.878 align:start position:0%
at the time I was waiting for her to
 
05:08:50.230 --> 05:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
Circle back to me uh because she
 
05:08:53.670 --> 05:08:53.680 align:start position:0%
mentioned that if the child testifies in
 
05:08:56.150 --> 05:08:56.160 align:start position:0%
private uh to the judge then it
 
05:08:59.030 --> 05:08:59.040 align:start position:0%
presented an app pellet issue because
 
05:09:02.628 --> 05:09:02.638 align:start position:0%
the parents would have would not have
 
05:09:05.390 --> 05:09:05.400 align:start position:0%
access to all of the evidence in their
 
05:09:11.110 --> 05:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
own uh case so I presented it at at that
 
05:09:13.150 --> 05:09:13.160 align:start position:0%
and we were not we did not execute at
 
05:09:16.430 --> 05:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
that time because I was waiting for her
 
05:09:20.548 --> 05:09:20.558 align:start position:0%
response well she responded back to me
 
05:09:23.990 --> 05:09:24.000 align:start position:0%
and she recommended the language that is
 
05:09:27.670 --> 05:09:27.680 align:start position:0%
in italics here um and
 
05:09:32.150 --> 05:09:32.160 align:start position:0%
I uh I asked her is so I sent it over
 
05:09:33.910 --> 05:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
over to OSS and when I got it back from
 
05:09:36.150 --> 05:09:36.160 align:start position:0%
OS I gave it to her to look at and I
 
05:09:38.910 --> 05:09:38.920 align:start position:0%
said what do you think she approved of
 
05:09:41.788 --> 05:09:41.798 align:start position:0%
the language and I asked
 
05:09:46.230 --> 05:09:46.240 align:start position:0%
her what if one parent consents and the
 
05:09:49.628 --> 05:09:49.638 align:start position:0%
other parent doesn't and she said that
 
05:09:52.510 --> 05:09:52.520 align:start position:0%
could happen however she does not
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
anticipate it happening because it would
 
05:09:57.070 --> 05:09:57.080 align:start position:0%
look really bad to the
 
05:10:00.070 --> 05:10:00.080 align:start position:0%
parents um and the judge would could see
 
05:10:03.230 --> 05:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
who consented and who didn't um so it's
 
05:10:05.230 --> 05:10:05.240 align:start position:0%
always a possibility because people can
 
05:10:08.788 --> 05:10:08.798 align:start position:0%
do kind of crazy things um but it would
 
05:10:11.030 --> 05:10:11.040 align:start position:0%
be bad for them to do it so she didn't
 
05:10:15.070 --> 05:10:15.080 align:start position:0%
expect it so I left the amendment like
 
05:10:20.230 --> 05:10:20.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:20.240 --> 05:10:23.310 align:start position:0%
 
committee

05:10:23.310 --> 05:10:23.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:25.830 --> 05:10:25.840 align:start position:0%
sure um okay
 
05:10:30.110 --> 05:10:30.120 align:start position:0%
so so the therapist gives an opinion to
 
05:10:30.120 --> 05:10:31.030 align:start position:0%
so so the therapist gives an opinion to
the

05:10:31.030 --> 05:10:31.040 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:10:33.708 --> 05:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
court is
 
05:10:36.670 --> 05:10:36.680 align:start position:0%
that is that information going to the
 
05:10:36.680 --> 05:10:38.190 align:start position:0%
that is that information going to the
parties

05:10:38.190 --> 05:10:38.200 align:start position:0%
parties
 
05:10:41.270 --> 05:10:41.280 align:start position:0%
yes okay so I would say that with the
 
05:10:44.270 --> 05:10:44.280 align:start position:0%
consent of the parties if that report is
 
05:10:46.990 --> 05:10:47.000 align:start position:0%
opposing me I'm not giving
 
05:10:49.750 --> 05:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
consent whether it happens rarely or not
 
05:10:51.350 --> 05:10:51.360 align:start position:0%
I don't believe it's gonna happen rely
 
05:10:52.990 --> 05:10:53.000 align:start position:0%
I'm G to look at this and say no I don't
 
05:10:56.110 --> 05:10:56.120 align:start position:0%
want this in so the therapist's opinion
 
05:11:00.190 --> 05:11:00.200 align:start position:0%
is just can the child can the child is
 
05:11:01.788 --> 05:11:01.798 align:start position:0%
the child mature enough to testify to
 
05:11:03.750 --> 05:11:03.760 align:start position:0%
the Court yes or no
 
05:11:06.750 --> 05:11:06.760 align:start position:0%
basically um so that's the report for
 
05:11:08.590 --> 05:11:08.600 align:start position:0%
the most part yes so that so a piece of
 
05:11:10.110 --> 05:11:10.120 align:start position:0%
paper is going to say the child is
 
05:11:13.510 --> 05:11:13.520 align:start position:0%
mature enough to testify yes that's the
 
05:11:16.230 --> 05:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
point and because the that doesn't seem
 
05:11:18.910 --> 05:11:18.920 align:start position:0%
like a report to me if you if you recall
 
05:11:21.150 --> 05:11:21.160 align:start position:0%
what the purpose of this bill is this
 
05:11:23.948 --> 05:11:23.958 align:start position:0%
bill is a gateway for the child to have
 
05:11:26.868 --> 05:11:26.878 align:start position:0%
their right to be heard in court and
 
05:11:29.030 --> 05:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
currently what what I found out in doing
 
05:11:32.830 --> 05:11:32.840 align:start position:0%
the research is that G's are not funded
 
05:11:35.350 --> 05:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
by the state and so they're only
 
05:11:37.708 --> 05:11:37.718 align:start position:0%
accessible to families who can pay for
 
05:11:40.948 --> 05:11:40.958 align:start position:0%
them and so judges are I'm just
 
05:11:43.750 --> 05:11:43.760 align:start position:0%
recapping from from when I introduced
 
05:11:45.948 --> 05:11:45.958 align:start position:0%
the bill judges are hesitant to bring
 
05:11:49.788 --> 05:11:49.798 align:start position:0%
the child in to testify because it can
 
05:11:52.070 --> 05:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
be traumatic to the child so we're in
 
05:11:56.110 --> 05:11:56.120 align:start position:0%
this like cost benefit situation where
 
05:11:58.350 --> 05:11:58.360 align:start position:0%
if they were to bring it in bring in the
 
05:12:01.230 --> 05:12:01.240 align:start position:0%
child to the court to assess their
 
05:12:02.510 --> 05:12:02.520 align:start position:0%
maturity Lev
 
05:12:05.948 --> 05:12:05.958 align:start position:0%
on if we can you know have this child
 
05:12:07.628 --> 05:12:07.638 align:start position:0%
testify in
 
05:12:10.628 --> 05:12:10.638 align:start position:0%
court and then the judge determines that
 
05:12:12.470 --> 05:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
the child can't because they're not
 
05:12:14.430 --> 05:12:14.440 align:start position:0%
mature enough then you brought them in
 
05:12:16.470 --> 05:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
you did trauma and you got nothing out
 
05:12:18.310 --> 05:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
of it because you determin that the
 
05:12:20.868 --> 05:12:20.878 align:start position:0%
child can't testify so the judges are
 
05:12:23.590 --> 05:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
are are staying away from that entire
 
05:12:25.628 --> 05:12:25.638 align:start position:0%
situation because they don't want to
 
05:12:27.788 --> 05:12:27.798 align:start position:0%
cause any trauma to a
 
05:12:32.868 --> 05:12:32.878 align:start position:0%
child so my idea was initially
 
05:12:36.708 --> 05:12:36.718 align:start position:0%
to have the to have the therapist simply
 
05:12:39.270 --> 05:12:39.280 align:start position:0%
state if the child has a therapist so
 
05:12:43.830 --> 05:12:43.840 align:start position:0%
not demanding that one has one um if
 
05:12:46.470 --> 05:12:46.480 align:start position:0%
that the that the therapist says that
 
05:12:49.110 --> 05:12:49.120 align:start position:0%
the child is mature enough and so the
 
05:12:52.150 --> 05:12:52.160 align:start position:0%
judge can get that testimony and say oh
 
05:12:53.948 --> 05:12:53.958 align:start position:0%
this child is mature enough to testify
 
05:12:56.510 --> 05:12:56.520 align:start position:0%
in court so let's bring them in and then
 
05:12:59.270 --> 05:12:59.280 align:start position:0%
once the child is and and a school
 
05:13:01.990 --> 05:13:02.000 align:start position:0%
therapist can do it too uh once the
 
05:13:05.910 --> 05:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
child is in the court have the CH child
 
05:13:08.750 --> 05:13:08.760 align:start position:0%
testify in the chambers and the purpose
 
05:13:10.310 --> 05:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
for that is because the child would feel
 
05:13:12.990 --> 05:13:13.000 align:start position:0%
more comfortable wouldn't it wouldn't be
 
05:13:14.830 --> 05:13:14.840 align:start position:0%
as stressful of a situation for the
 
05:13:17.430 --> 05:13:17.440 align:start position:0%
child and then also we wouldn't pit the
 
05:13:19.548 --> 05:13:19.558 align:start position:0%
parents against each other and we
 
05:13:21.430 --> 05:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have like outside influences on
 
05:13:23.510 --> 05:13:23.520 align:start position:0%
the child the child can just and again
 
05:13:27.548 --> 05:13:27.558 align:start position:0%
this is in a situation where they're you
 
05:13:29.948 --> 05:13:29.958 align:start position:0%
know they're just wanting to craft their
 
05:13:32.628 --> 05:13:32.638 align:start position:0%
own schedule where you know these kids
 
05:13:34.708 --> 05:13:34.718 align:start position:0%
who are mature enough are presumably in
 
05:13:37.548 --> 05:13:37.558 align:start position:0%
middle school and high school
 
05:13:40.190 --> 05:13:40.200 align:start position:0%
um someone brought up an example if
 
05:13:41.590 --> 05:13:41.600 align:start position:0%
they're on the football team and they
 
05:13:43.868 --> 05:13:43.878 align:start position:0%
have practice every day how are you
 
05:13:46.628 --> 05:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
going to how do you want the parenting
 
05:13:49.628 --> 05:13:49.638 align:start position:0%
time to look like oh well I have
 
05:13:53.030 --> 05:13:53.040 align:start position:0%
football until 5:00 well maybe I'll do
 
05:13:55.990 --> 05:13:56.000 align:start position:0%
Monday and Tuesday with Dad and
 
05:13:57.830 --> 05:13:57.840 align:start position:0%
Wednesday and Thursday with Mom or
 
05:14:01.948 --> 05:14:01.958 align:start position:0%
something something but just to put the
 
05:14:04.750 --> 05:14:04.760 align:start position:0%
control back into the hands of the child
 
05:14:07.350 --> 05:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
because it is their life but still give
 
05:14:10.350 --> 05:14:10.360 align:start position:0%
the parents equal parenting time but the
 
05:14:12.948 --> 05:14:12.958 align:start position:0%
child gives their opinion so it's not a
 
05:14:15.390 --> 05:14:15.400 align:start position:0%
demand an opinion about what that
 
05:14:16.948 --> 05:14:16.958 align:start position:0%
parenting time looks
 
05:14:19.510 --> 05:14:19.520 align:start position:0%
like because there's about 80 million
 
05:14:22.230 --> 05:14:22.240 align:start position:0%
different ways that equal parenting time
 
05:14:23.190 --> 05:14:23.200 align:start position:0%
can look
 
05:14:25.708 --> 05:14:25.718 align:start position:0%
like representative D
 
05:14:28.030 --> 05:14:28.040 align:start position:0%
Simone thank you Mr
 
05:14:28.040 --> 05:14:30.670 align:start position:0%
Simone thank you Mr
chairman

05:14:30.670 --> 05:14:30.680 align:start position:0%
chairman
 
05:14:32.910 --> 05:14:32.920 align:start position:0%
basically the bill and the amendment
 
05:14:36.310 --> 05:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
makes sense however to representative
 
05:14:36.320 --> 05:14:38.910 align:start position:0%
makes sense however to representative
Long's

05:14:38.910 --> 05:14:38.920 align:start position:0%
Long's
 
05:14:45.310 --> 05:14:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:49.708 --> 05:14:49.718 align:start position:0%
know older mature children are very
 
05:14:54.430 --> 05:14:54.440 align:start position:0%
manipulative so if Mom is the more
 
05:14:58.708 --> 05:14:58.718 align:start position:0%
strict parent and dad is the more fun
 
05:15:01.788 --> 05:15:01.798 align:start position:0%
parent this child's going to want to go
 
05:15:06.708 --> 05:15:06.718 align:start position:0%
to Dad and Dad's and Mom's going to say
 
05:15:09.350 --> 05:15:09.360 align:start position:0%
I'm not going to okay
 
05:15:14.430 --> 05:15:14.440 align:start position:0%
this so I don't care how mature my child
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
is I don't
 
05:15:20.470 --> 05:15:20.480 align:start position:0%
agree so this bill does not address what
 
05:15:22.868 --> 05:15:22.878 align:start position:0%
the judge would ask the
 
05:15:24.910 --> 05:15:24.920 align:start position:0%
child um
 
05:15:24.920 --> 05:15:26.670 align:start position:0%
child um
so

05:15:26.670 --> 05:15:26.680 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:15:29.310 --> 05:15:29.320 align:start position:0%
basically the child would have to have
 
05:15:31.830 --> 05:15:31.840 align:start position:0%
equal parenting time or however the
 
05:15:33.110 --> 05:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
parenting time is
 
05:15:36.230 --> 05:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
ordered and the goal here is just for
 
05:15:38.030 --> 05:15:38.040 align:start position:0%
the child to have a little bit of a say
 
05:15:40.230 --> 05:15:40.240 align:start position:0%
in what happens as far as like when
 
05:15:41.470 --> 05:15:41.480 align:start position:0%
they're with their mom and when they're
 
05:15:43.110 --> 05:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
with their dad not if they're with their
 
05:15:46.030 --> 05:15:46.040 align:start position:0%
mom or with their dad that's the judge's
 
05:15:49.628 --> 05:15:49.638 align:start position:0%
determination so I'm not
 
05:15:52.670 --> 05:15:52.680 align:start position:0%
foreseeing a situation where it's like
 
05:15:54.390 --> 05:15:54.400 align:start position:0%
oh I'm mad at my mom so now I only want
 
05:15:57.910 --> 05:15:57.920 align:start position:0%
to spend time with my dad because I'm
 
05:16:00.750 --> 05:16:00.760 align:start position:0%
foreseeing a situation where the child's
 
05:16:02.030 --> 05:16:02.040 align:start position:0%
going to spend time with
 
05:16:05.310 --> 05:16:05.320 align:start position:0%
both and this is just
 
05:16:08.390 --> 05:16:08.400 align:start position:0%
crafting what it's going to look
 
05:16:10.350 --> 05:16:10.360 align:start position:0%
like and that I think that's the
 
05:16:13.190 --> 05:16:13.200 align:start position:0%
impression that Aaron crean got as well
 
05:16:15.750 --> 05:16:15.760 align:start position:0%
who's that that attorney who actually
 
05:16:17.788 --> 05:16:17.798 align:start position:0%
spoke to the family law judges and came
 
05:16:19.430 --> 05:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
back with this
 
05:16:23.310 --> 05:16:23.320 align:start position:0%
language so you know anything that that
 
05:16:26.788 --> 05:16:26.798 align:start position:0%
requires o adult only assessment is left
 
05:16:29.030 --> 05:16:29.040 align:start position:0%
to the parents and the judge this is
 
05:16:31.910 --> 05:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
kind of like the Minor Details so it
 
05:16:34.350 --> 05:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
sounds to me like the child who is the
 
05:16:36.910 --> 05:16:36.920 align:start position:0%
guest of honor in all of these things
 
05:16:38.310 --> 05:16:38.320 align:start position:0%
actually gets a little bit of standing
 
05:16:38.320 --> 05:16:39.110 align:start position:0%
actually gets a little bit of standing
in

05:16:39.110 --> 05:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:16:41.830 --> 05:16:41.840 align:start position:0%
court that's that yeah because the child
 
05:16:44.230 --> 05:16:44.240 align:start position:0%
has a right to be heard that that is
 
05:16:46.830 --> 05:16:46.840 align:start position:0%
what the the studies actually say that
 
05:16:48.190 --> 05:16:48.200 align:start position:0%
the child has a right to be in other
 
05:16:49.708 --> 05:16:49.718 align:start position:0%
words we shouldn't overthink this all
 
05:16:53.590 --> 05:16:53.600 align:start position:0%
this is is not to diminish you a simple
 
05:16:56.430 --> 05:16:56.440 align:start position:0%
thing right it's not that the judge has
 
05:16:59.030 --> 05:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
to if if the judge determines like oh
 
05:17:02.590 --> 05:17:02.600 align:start position:0%
this child might be being manipulative
 
05:17:05.470 --> 05:17:05.480 align:start position:0%
that's on the judge to determine I'm not
 
05:17:06.910 --> 05:17:06.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not saying what the judge has to
 
05:17:09.230 --> 05:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
order I'm just saying I want the judge
 
05:17:12.030 --> 05:17:12.040 align:start position:0%
to be able to talk to the child and then
 
05:17:14.670 --> 05:17:14.680 align:start position:0%
the child to give their opinion and the
 
05:17:16.750 --> 05:17:16.760 align:start position:0%
judge to use that opinion not
 
05:17:18.750 --> 05:17:18.760 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to order according to
 
05:17:21.590 --> 05:17:21.600 align:start position:0%
the child's opinion but just use that as
 
05:17:23.350 --> 05:17:23.360 align:start position:0%
another piece of information that's
 
05:17:26.590 --> 05:17:26.600 align:start position:0%
coming in piece of
 
05:17:29.150 --> 05:17:29.160 align:start position:0%
evidence representative
 
05:17:31.590 --> 05:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
ball thank you chairman parison and
 
05:17:33.628 --> 05:17:33.638 align:start position:0%
thank you for bringing the amendment um
 
05:17:34.590 --> 05:17:34.600 align:start position:0%
I do
 
05:17:37.310 --> 05:17:37.320 align:start position:0%
have a couple concerns and I think I
 
05:17:39.510 --> 05:17:39.520 align:start position:0%
brought them up before because it
 
05:17:42.470 --> 05:17:42.480 align:start position:0%
already says that the judge can consider
 
05:17:44.350 --> 05:17:44.360 align:start position:0%
can give do consideration to other
 
05:17:46.510 --> 05:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
factors right and all of this input
 
05:17:49.150 --> 05:17:49.160 align:start position:0%
would be other factors great um so
 
05:17:50.750 --> 05:17:50.760 align:start position:0%
that's the one thing the other is this
 
05:17:52.310 --> 05:17:52.320 align:start position:0%
is saying therapists and you say it
 
05:17:53.868 --> 05:17:53.878 align:start position:0%
could be a school therapist but it
 
05:17:55.948 --> 05:17:55.958 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that so it's very vague as
 
05:17:59.470 --> 05:17:59.480 align:start position:0%
to what is a therapist um I'm not really
 
05:18:02.110 --> 05:18:02.120 align:start position:0%
sure what a therapist is um the other
 
05:18:06.390 --> 05:18:06.400 align:start position:0%
thing is um you mentioned that they
 
05:18:08.750 --> 05:18:08.760 align:start position:0%
can't afford a j but who can afford a
 
05:18:11.110 --> 05:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
therapist so I'm kind of I'm hearing
 
05:18:13.868 --> 05:18:13.878 align:start position:0%
like mixed things going on and I like
 
05:18:16.830 --> 05:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
the idea of a child having their opinion
 
05:18:19.788 --> 05:18:19.798 align:start position:0%
but unfortunately their opinion goes
 
05:18:22.670 --> 05:18:22.680 align:start position:0%
this way in a very narrow focus and so
 
05:18:24.430 --> 05:18:24.440 align:start position:0%
they can say well I want to be with Dad
 
05:18:26.510 --> 05:18:26.520 align:start position:0%
on the nights I have football and dad is
 
05:18:28.190 --> 05:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
saying okay but I got to get your
 
05:18:31.470 --> 05:18:31.480 align:start position:0%
daughter my you know another child to to
 
05:18:34.110 --> 05:18:34.120 align:start position:0%
ballet on that same night like just
 
05:18:36.030 --> 05:18:36.040 align:start position:0%
because it's what they want it doesn't
 
05:18:39.110 --> 05:18:39.120 align:start position:0%
necessarily in fit into the whole family
 
05:18:41.628 --> 05:18:41.638 align:start position:0%
Dynamics I mean it's it sounds great if
 
05:18:43.590 --> 05:18:43.600 align:start position:0%
you have an only child but if you're
 
05:18:46.590 --> 05:18:46.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with multiple children it's
 
05:18:49.270 --> 05:18:49.280 align:start position:0%
really the parents again going back to
 
05:18:51.548 --> 05:18:51.558 align:start position:0%
our last thing of saying parents need to
 
05:18:53.708 --> 05:18:53.718 align:start position:0%
know what's best for their child and now
 
05:18:55.910 --> 05:18:55.920 align:start position:0%
all of a sudden we're saying well well
 
05:18:57.230 --> 05:18:57.240 align:start position:0%
not in this case we're going to let the
 
05:18:59.590 --> 05:18:59.600 align:start position:0%
child decide and I understand just give
 
05:19:01.430 --> 05:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
their opinion but then I would go back
 
05:19:04.750 --> 05:19:04.760 align:start position:0%
and say it's already covered in the in
 
05:19:08.270 --> 05:19:08.280 align:start position:0%
the being able to consider the other
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
factors I think what you're bringing up
 
05:19:13.350 --> 05:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
might be the case in some
 
05:19:16.190 --> 05:19:16.200 align:start position:0%
situations um but that could be
 
05:19:18.350 --> 05:19:18.360 align:start position:0%
addressed when the parties are talking
 
05:19:21.548 --> 05:19:21.558 align:start position:0%
to the judge so in other words you know
 
05:19:23.910 --> 05:19:23.920 align:start position:0%
the judge comes back and is like oh well
 
05:19:25.590 --> 05:19:25.600 align:start position:0%
you know the child wants to spend
 
05:19:28.910 --> 05:19:28.920 align:start position:0%
Fridays with Dad um whatever I don't
 
05:19:31.070 --> 05:19:31.080 align:start position:0%
know I'm just making up something random
 
05:19:32.990 --> 05:19:33.000 align:start position:0%
and and the dad says oh well I have
 
05:19:35.670 --> 05:19:35.680 align:start position:0%
another child to do ballet with then
 
05:19:37.430 --> 05:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
then the judge doesn't have to order
 
05:19:40.310 --> 05:19:40.320 align:start position:0%
that you know I'm not I'm not saying the
 
05:19:42.030 --> 05:19:42.040 align:start position:0%
judge has to order what the child's
 
05:19:43.990 --> 05:19:44.000 align:start position:0%
opinion is I'm not saying that I'm just
 
05:19:48.548 --> 05:19:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:52.190 --> 05:19:52.200 align:start position:0%
puzzle representative Greg thank you Mr
 
05:19:54.190 --> 05:19:54.200 align:start position:0%
chairman you know this
 
05:19:57.230 --> 05:19:57.240 align:start position:0%
is I struggle with this because I you
 
05:19:59.310 --> 05:19:59.320 align:start position:0%
know I I understand you know kids
 
05:20:01.430 --> 05:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
needing to get H and stuff but you look
 
05:20:03.750 --> 05:20:03.760 align:start position:0%
at no matter how mature a child is
 
05:20:05.230 --> 05:20:05.240 align:start position:0%
whenever you have parents who have
 
05:20:08.070 --> 05:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
divorced this is a very disruptive thing
 
05:20:10.430 --> 05:20:10.440 align:start position:0%
so the whether or not they're mature or
 
05:20:12.270 --> 05:20:12.280 align:start position:0%
not emotionally we've just put them in a
 
05:20:15.230 --> 05:20:15.240 align:start position:0%
very you know bad position whether it be
 
05:20:16.470 --> 05:20:16.480 align:start position:0%
that the parents weren't getting along
 
05:20:17.910 --> 05:20:17.920 align:start position:0%
or whatever it's still disruption in
 
05:20:22.310 --> 05:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
their life so to then give them this you
 
05:20:24.868 --> 05:20:24.878 align:start position:0%
know Willy Wonka card of oh let's get
 
05:20:28.270 --> 05:20:28.280 align:start position:0%
your opinion on it the the level of
 
05:20:30.070 --> 05:20:30.080 align:start position:0%
difficulty that puts a child in whether
 
05:20:32.990 --> 05:20:33.000 align:start position:0%
it be you know they have feelings of oh
 
05:20:34.670 --> 05:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
I don't want to make this parent feel
 
05:20:36.310 --> 05:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
bad or I don't want to make that parent
 
05:20:38.990 --> 05:20:39.000 align:start position:0%
feel bad I just think it's really this
 
05:20:41.230 --> 05:20:41.240 align:start position:0%
is inappropriate you know I once again
 
05:20:43.430 --> 05:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
like I said before I think the judge you
 
05:20:43.440 --> 05:20:44.470 align:start position:0%
like I said before I think the judge you
know

05:20:44.470 --> 05:20:44.480 align:start position:0%
know
 
05:20:47.990 --> 05:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
has a job to look at the entire blanket
 
05:20:49.910 --> 05:20:49.920 align:start position:0%
and see what's going on because even as
 
05:20:52.628 --> 05:20:52.638 align:start position:0%
parents we don't always have insight
 
05:20:55.590 --> 05:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
into how our what we're doing might
 
05:20:57.788 --> 05:20:57.798 align:start position:0%
might affect that child but what we do
 
05:21:00.110 --> 05:21:00.120 align:start position:0%
have is an obligation as a parent is to
 
05:21:02.110 --> 05:21:02.120 align:start position:0%
protect our children and and sometimes
 
05:21:03.708 --> 05:21:03.718 align:start position:0%
that's protecting them from putting them
 
05:21:06.628 --> 05:21:06.638 align:start position:0%
in a very
 
05:21:10.070 --> 05:21:10.080 align:start position:0%
um emotionally damaging situation with M
 
05:21:12.548 --> 05:21:12.558 align:start position:0%
making them determine one parent or the
 
05:21:14.708 --> 05:21:14.718 align:start position:0%
other could very well be that so that's
 
05:21:16.628 --> 05:21:16.638 align:start position:0%
the reason why the child's going to
 
05:21:20.590 --> 05:21:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:22.830 --> 05:21:22.840 align:start position:0%
Chambers thank you but they still know
 
05:21:24.868 --> 05:21:24.878 align:start position:0%
it's getting back to their parents and
 
05:21:26.310 --> 05:21:26.320 align:start position:0%
and and by the way we might have a
 
05:21:27.590 --> 05:21:27.600 align:start position:0%
parent that's not really very
 
05:21:29.310 --> 05:21:29.320 align:start position:0%
emotionally mature that's going to say
 
05:21:31.110 --> 05:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
so why did you say that you want to be
 
05:21:33.628 --> 05:21:33.638 align:start position:0%
be with you know your mom all this time
 
05:21:37.150 --> 05:21:37.160 align:start position:0%
and not me this is not this is a a child
 
05:21:38.708 --> 05:21:38.718 align:start position:0%
is never a tug-of-war rope it should
 
05:21:40.590 --> 05:21:40.600 align:start position:0%
never be and and our committee this is
 
05:21:42.350 --> 05:21:42.360 align:start position:0%
what we should be looking at what is
 
05:21:46.150 --> 05:21:46.160 align:start position:0%
best for the child and I do not see you
 
05:21:48.270 --> 05:21:48.280 align:start position:0%
know pivoting them in this as being best
 
05:21:51.948 --> 05:21:51.958 align:start position:0%
for the child in any any which way so
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
just to answer your
 
05:21:57.110 --> 05:21:57.120 align:start position:0%
question not a guarantee that the judge
 
05:22:00.030 --> 05:22:00.040 align:start position:0%
would disclose everything that the child
 
05:22:00.040 --> 05:22:02.948 align:start position:0%
would disclose everything that the child
says

05:22:02.948 --> 05:22:02.958 align:start position:0%
says
 
05:22:04.430 --> 05:22:04.440 align:start position:0%
because that language isn't in there and
 
05:22:06.868 --> 05:22:06.878 align:start position:0%
also just as a reminder that the the
 
05:22:11.470 --> 05:22:11.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:13.990 --> 05:22:14.000 align:start position:0%
language representative
 
05:22:17.948 --> 05:22:17.958 align:start position:0%
sidel thank you Mr chairman um my in
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
reading this it's already in statute
 
05:22:23.190 --> 05:22:23.200 align:start position:0%
that the court is going to it's up to
 
05:22:24.548 --> 05:22:24.558 align:start position:0%
the evidence that the minor child has
 
05:22:27.270 --> 05:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
sufficient maturity the child a lot of
 
05:22:29.070 --> 05:22:29.080 align:start position:0%
these times are is already going to
 
05:22:31.190 --> 05:22:31.200 align:start position:0%
testify is already going to speak speak
 
05:22:33.270 --> 05:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
at least to the judge they're not isn't
 
05:22:36.670 --> 05:22:36.680 align:start position:0%
this just another no so the child that's
 
05:22:38.510 --> 05:22:38.520 align:start position:0%
the whole point that's what we're that's
 
05:22:41.190 --> 05:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
what we're addressing is that the child
 
05:22:44.190 --> 05:22:44.200 align:start position:0%
is not being brought in at all at all
 
05:22:45.350 --> 05:22:45.360 align:start position:0%
okay because it was my understanding
 
05:22:47.070 --> 05:22:47.080 align:start position:0%
that this this is just adding the
 
05:22:49.948 --> 05:22:49.958 align:start position:0%
therapist's opinion to help the child
 
05:22:52.190 --> 05:22:52.200 align:start position:0%
this is a pathway to bring the child in
 
05:22:54.190 --> 05:22:54.200 align:start position:0%
because the child is not being brought
 
05:22:57.910 --> 05:22:57.920 align:start position:0%
in okay because the the
 
05:23:01.628 --> 05:23:01.638 align:start position:0%
underlying uh issue is that bring the
 
05:23:05.548 --> 05:23:05.558 align:start position:0%
the child in may cause trauma to the
 
05:23:07.670 --> 05:23:07.680 align:start position:0%
child or
 
05:23:10.470 --> 05:23:10.480 align:start position:0%
stress I to use a better term I think it
 
05:23:12.628 --> 05:23:12.638 align:start position:0%
would be stress but some of the studies
 
05:23:16.110 --> 05:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
I was reading said trauma so um so
 
05:23:18.470 --> 05:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
because it's a stressful situation for
 
05:23:21.030 --> 05:23:21.040 align:start position:0%
the child the judges tend to not bring
 
05:23:22.948 --> 05:23:22.958 align:start position:0%
them in and that's where we get into
 
05:23:22.958 --> 05:23:24.190 align:start position:0%
them in and that's where we get into
this

05:23:24.190 --> 05:23:24.200 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:23:27.670 --> 05:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
issue representative
 
05:23:33.948 --> 05:23:33.958 align:start position:0%
long uh thank you Mr chairman so um so I
 
05:23:35.788 --> 05:23:35.798 align:start position:0%
understand what the problem is MH but I
 
05:23:37.430 --> 05:23:37.440 align:start position:0%
don't see this fixing a problem cu the
 
05:23:39.350 --> 05:23:39.360 align:start position:0%
judge May interview the child so you're
 
05:23:41.070 --> 05:23:41.080 align:start position:0%
still going to have the problem the
 
05:23:42.510 --> 05:23:42.520 align:start position:0%
judge is not going to interview the
 
05:23:45.230 --> 05:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
child uh so what I see this I mean this
 
05:23:48.070 --> 05:23:48.080 align:start position:0%
is just my opinion I see two parties
 
05:23:50.590 --> 05:23:50.600 align:start position:0%
parents not being able to figure
 
05:23:53.110 --> 05:23:53.120 align:start position:0%
something out let's turn it over to the
 
05:23:55.910 --> 05:23:55.920 align:start position:0%
kid totally
 
05:23:58.708 --> 05:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
inappropriate representative
 
05:24:03.150 --> 05:24:03.160 align:start position:0%
Perez may I yeah thank you well the
 
05:24:05.150 --> 05:24:05.160 align:start position:0%
problem that I'm seeing here is that we
 
05:24:08.470 --> 05:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
already have a lot of child they already
 
05:24:10.788 --> 05:24:10.798 align:start position:0%
traumatized and why do we want to put
 
05:24:14.150 --> 05:24:14.160 align:start position:0%
this Shell through I'm more traumatized
 
05:24:17.230 --> 05:24:17.240 align:start position:0%
by put them you know through the core if
 
05:24:20.628 --> 05:24:20.638 align:start position:0%
they allowed you know already to testify
 
05:24:22.750 --> 05:24:22.760 align:start position:0%
or they're already coming into the court
 
05:24:25.750 --> 05:24:25.760 align:start position:0%
why do we need this kind of Bill to just
 
05:24:28.708 --> 05:24:28.718 align:start position:0%
putting big things into that those shoes
 
05:24:31.070 --> 05:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
that they they don't wish to be
 
05:24:34.510 --> 05:24:34.520 align:start position:0%
especially minors why well because at
 
05:24:38.310 --> 05:24:38.320 align:start position:0%
certain ages sometimes they do want to
 
05:24:42.948 --> 05:24:42.958 align:start position:0%
testify um at at at different ages they
 
05:24:45.910 --> 05:24:45.920 align:start position:0%
have different opinions uh but the child
 
05:24:47.990 --> 05:24:48.000 align:start position:0%
does have a right to be
 
05:24:54.270 --> 05:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:56.830 --> 05:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
05:24:59.270 --> 05:24:59.280 align:start position:0%
Bickford thank you Mr
 
05:25:01.750 --> 05:25:01.760 align:start position:0%
chairman thank you
 
05:25:05.030 --> 05:25:05.040 align:start position:0%
representative given um I I see
 
05:25:08.430 --> 05:25:08.440 align:start position:0%
something in the amendment anyway uh but
 
05:25:10.628 --> 05:25:10.638 align:start position:0%
we're on the bill we're on the amendment
 
05:25:13.990 --> 05:25:14.000 align:start position:0%
we're on the amendment thank you um that
 
05:25:17.548 --> 05:25:17.558 align:start position:0%
I think adds confusion and that is where
 
05:25:19.270 --> 05:25:19.280 align:start position:0%
it says
 
05:25:23.230 --> 05:25:23.240 align:start position:0%
um at on line seven at the end of
 
05:25:25.430 --> 05:25:25.440 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that speaks substantial
 
05:25:27.548 --> 05:25:27.558 align:start position:0%
weight to the preference of the mature
 
05:25:31.948 --> 05:25:31.958 align:start position:0%
minor child your what you've added to
 
05:25:34.390 --> 05:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
the bill belongs there and the next
 
05:25:36.548 --> 05:25:36.558 align:start position:0%
sentence should come afterwards because
 
05:25:38.190 --> 05:25:38.200 align:start position:0%
the next sentence talks about something
 
05:25:41.190 --> 05:25:41.200 align:start position:0%
else not about maturity it talks about
 
05:25:43.350 --> 05:25:43.360 align:start position:0%
give due consideration to other factors
 
05:25:45.230 --> 05:25:45.240 align:start position:0%
which may have affected the minor
 
05:25:48.628 --> 05:25:48.638 align:start position:0%
child's preferences which is after the
 
05:25:51.708 --> 05:25:51.718 align:start position:0%
fact which which is done after the uh
 
05:25:53.868 --> 05:25:53.878 align:start position:0%
therapist and the consideration of
 
05:25:56.470 --> 05:25:56.480 align:start position:0%
whether they're mature or child and a so
 
05:25:57.628 --> 05:25:57.638 align:start position:0%
they should have been separated I
 
05:25:57.638 --> 05:25:59.310 align:start position:0%
they should have been separated I
believe

05:25:59.310 --> 05:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
believe
 
05:26:01.830 --> 05:26:01.840 align:start position:0%
there I mean maybe that's a housekeeping
 
05:26:05.868 --> 05:26:05.878 align:start position:0%
issue but um the the the attorney and
 
05:26:07.628 --> 05:26:07.638 align:start position:0%
the family court judges didn't see an
 
05:26:10.070 --> 05:26:10.080 align:start position:0%
issue with
 
05:26:12.990 --> 05:26:13.000 align:start position:0%
it well they
 
05:26:15.548 --> 05:26:15.558 align:start position:0%
know having read law books like you
 
05:26:17.948 --> 05:26:17.958 align:start position:0%
wouldn't believe in the last year I find
 
05:26:21.868 --> 05:26:21.878 align:start position:0%
sometimes the narrative goes 1 3 2 four
 
05:26:24.590 --> 05:26:24.600 align:start position:0%
five yeah so I'm not worried about that
 
05:26:27.510 --> 05:26:27.520 align:start position:0%
representative uh somebody over here had
 
05:26:28.910 --> 05:26:28.920 align:start position:0%

05:26:35.830 --> 05:26:35.840 align:start position:0%
Nelson thank you Mr chairman um I agree
 
05:26:38.390 --> 05:26:38.400 align:start position:0%
with um representative Sidell and
 
05:26:39.590 --> 05:26:39.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes I can't read my own
 
05:26:41.470 --> 05:26:41.480 align:start position:0%
handwriting so
 
05:26:45.350 --> 05:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
maybe maybe people can um maybe other
 
05:26:47.390 --> 05:26:47.400 align:start position:0%
people remember I thought we did hear in
 
05:26:50.628 --> 05:26:50.638 align:start position:0%
testimony that it was up to the judge's
 
05:26:53.670 --> 05:26:53.680 align:start position:0%
discretion to determine maturity and
 
05:26:57.110 --> 05:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
that's what we're trying to
 
05:27:01.390 --> 05:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
help right but they're not doing it so
 
05:27:04.868 --> 05:27:04.878 align:start position:0%
that's why we're trying to help so it so
 
05:27:08.390 --> 05:27:08.400 align:start position:0%
yep go ahead so how would this um
 
05:27:14.548 --> 05:27:14.558 align:start position:0%
increase the um ability for the child to
 
05:27:16.708 --> 05:27:16.718 align:start position:0%
because it's taking the assessment piece
 
05:27:18.230 --> 05:27:18.240 align:start position:0%
off of the
 
05:27:21.270 --> 05:27:21.280 align:start position:0%
judge which is that that's where the
 
05:27:25.470 --> 05:27:25.480 align:start position:0%
hiccup is and it's a it's a wellknown
 
05:27:28.110 --> 05:27:28.120 align:start position:0%
problem I think because that attorney
 
05:27:31.750 --> 05:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
krian was saying that this is a uh this
 
05:27:34.430 --> 05:27:34.440 align:start position:0%
affects a lot of
 
05:27:37.470 --> 05:27:37.480 align:start position:0%
cases okay I'm going to hope that no one
 
05:27:39.830 --> 05:27:39.840 align:start position:0%
has a hand up and we're going to do
 
05:27:41.390 --> 05:27:41.400 align:start position:0%
something now that we should have done
 
05:27:42.868 --> 05:27:42.878 align:start position:0%
