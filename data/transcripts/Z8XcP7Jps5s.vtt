program therefore
 
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 align:start position:0%

okay
 
00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 align:start position:0%
House Bill 468 making an appropriation
 
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 align:start position:0%
of the Department of Education for an
 
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 align:start position:0%
attorney to recodify education laws
 
00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
oh boy
 
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
I think this had the the bill itself had
 
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
a thousand dollars or some
 
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
ridiculously a known number in it and I
 
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.009 align:start position:0%
ridiculously a known number in it and I
don't

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:07.019 align:start position:0%
don't
 
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 align:start position:0%
uh can you
 
00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:11.939 align:start position:0%
I read a comment from the Senate that it
 
00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 align:start position:0%
was not supported that much by the by
 
00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 align:start position:0%
the department but we got somebody here
 
00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 align:start position:0%
to let us know
 
00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to come forward into the
 
00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:36.430 align:start position:0%
if you'd like to come forward into the
microphone

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.060 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Diana Fenton with the
 
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 align:start position:0%
um I'm happy to speak to the bill let me
 
00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 align:start position:0%
just give me a minute to pull it up or
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:54.900 align:start position:0%
I does it have the support of the
 
00:04:58.249 --> 00:04:58.259 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.259 align:start position:0%
it came from the Department so there is
 
00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 align:start position:0%
a recognition that there are a lot of
 
00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 align:start position:0%
laws in the education book that
 
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.360 align:start position:0%
sometimes are contrary to each other are
 
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.450 align:start position:0%
sometimes are contrary to each other are
duplicative

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 align:start position:0%
duplicative
 
00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 align:start position:0%
um there is an enormous amount of
 
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:17.220 align:start position:0%
information in that law book and
 
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.950 align:start position:0%
information in that law book and
um

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 align:start position:0%
it would be a benefit to the education
 
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 align:start position:0%
community and the field that we serve to
 
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 align:start position:0%
hire someone to go through and really
 
00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 align:start position:0%
cull through that information it is a
 
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:32.820 align:start position:0%
tedious process it's well worth it but
 
00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 align:start position:0%
it's a an undertaking the department
 
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 align:start position:0%
does not have the resources to do
 
00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 align:start position:0%
I do believe that it would be a benefit
 
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520 align:start position:0%
to everyone in the legislature
 
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:43.560 align:start position:0%
especially in House Education and to the
 
00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:46.199 align:start position:0%
field and I appreciate representative
 
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:48.960 align:start position:0%
Heath support
 
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 align:start position:0%
um from her chair over there I think
 
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:55.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair just a question I
 
00:05:59.629 --> 00:05:59.639 align:start position:0%
remember when we talked about this bill
 
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
the first time the agreement was that
 
00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 align:start position:0%
the estimate was extremely rough and
 
00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 align:start position:0%
really was nowhere near the actual
 
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:08.940 align:start position:0%
amount needed to come to complete this
 
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:11.820 align:start position:0%
can you update us on any uh refinements
 
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:14.280 align:start position:0%
or additions to that estimate how long
 
00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:16.500 align:start position:0%
would this take how expensive would it
 
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.060 align:start position:0%
be I mean it's been a few months since
 
00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.950 align:start position:0%
be I mean it's been a few months since
then

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:22.860 align:start position:0%
so I just pulled up the bill here and uh
 
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 align:start position:0%
it allows for a hundred thousand dollar
 
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.110 align:start position:0%
it allows for a hundred thousand dollar
appropriation

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
appropriation
 
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:27.650 align:start position:0%
appropriation
um

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:27.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:29.220 align:start position:0%
and I
 
00:06:31.309 --> 00:06:31.319 align:start position:0%
that is an enormous amount of money and
 
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.060 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to tell you otherwise but I
 
00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 align:start position:0%
can tell you that given the task I think
 
00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 align:start position:0%
it's appropriate I think what you will
 
00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 align:start position:0%
find and I don't mean you individually
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
but the generic uh General you is once
 
00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
we find an attorney to undertake that
 
00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 align:start position:0%
task there is going to be a lot of
 
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:51.240 align:start position:0%
various areas that that individual will
 
00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:54.360 align:start position:0%
identify of needing help needing rules
 
00:06:56.749 --> 00:06:56.759 align:start position:0%
perhaps rules that are outdated there's
 
00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
a lot of offshoots of that project this
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
also doesn't mean that all hundred
 
00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:04.620 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars has to be spent
 
00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 align:start position:0%
but I think that amount is sufficient to
 
00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 align:start position:0%
to Really spearhead that project and get
 
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:12.780 align:start position:0%
it underway
 
00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:13.919 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I can't remember
 
00:07:20.450 --> 00:07:20.460 align:start position:0%
Diane um was there an end date for this
 
00:07:24.469 --> 00:07:24.479 align:start position:0%
that the task had to be completed by the
 
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:27.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:29.749 --> 00:07:29.759 align:start position:0%
I'm just looking at the language of the
 
00:07:33.589 --> 00:07:33.599 align:start position:0%
was it the end of 25 or 24
 
00:07:35.689 --> 00:07:35.699 align:start position:0%
24 would be short I don't think it would
 
00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:39.539 align:start position:0%
have been 24. September 30 2024. is what
 
00:07:41.749 --> 00:07:41.759 align:start position:0%
the bill it was 24. oh it was 24. I
 
00:07:41.759 --> 00:07:43.850 align:start position:0%
the bill it was 24. oh it was 24. I
apologize

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:43.860 align:start position:0%
apologize
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:51.589 --> 00:07:51.599 align:start position:0%
that's an interesting quote there's two
 
00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:53.460 align:start position:0%
interesting questions here
 
00:07:55.309 --> 00:07:55.319 align:start position:0%
yeah let me just
 
00:07:57.469 --> 00:07:57.479 align:start position:0%
two issues one is
 
00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880 align:start position:0%
it's reopening the budget
 
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.550 align:start position:0%
it's reopening the budget
uh

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:01.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:03.660 align:start position:0%
and we really want to do that
 
00:08:05.809 --> 00:08:05.819 align:start position:0%
and the second one is
 
00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:08.940 align:start position:0%
the process to to amend it if that's
 
00:08:10.249 --> 00:08:10.259 align:start position:0%
what we want to do
 
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:13.380 align:start position:0%
I I've not done this before so I don't
 
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:15.960 align:start position:0%
say oh here's the three steps so what
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
what do we do do we get an amendment
 
00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:21.060 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman
 
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:23.520 align:start position:0%
we could make the effective date the
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:28.500 align:start position:0%
or we could say from funds not otherwise
 
00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:31.020 align:start position:0%
appropriate if we know that the Senate
 
00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:34.560 align:start position:0%
has put 297 million in Surplus education
 
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
trust fund like idiots but uh and and
 
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
the third thing I'm thinking of is
 
00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:44.750 align:start position:0%
the third thing I'm thinking of is
um

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
Anthony Daniel Antonio is retiring in
 
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:50.389 align:start position:0%
Anthony Daniel Antonio is retiring in
January

00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
January
 
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:53.820 align:start position:0%
it would seem like the ideal guy
 
00:08:56.210 --> 00:08:56.220 align:start position:0%
if he could be talked into taking this
 
00:08:58.190 --> 00:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
on as a project
 
00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:01.560 align:start position:0%
I mean he's been writing
 
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:06.060 align:start position:0%
what 30 years of education laws
 
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:08.220 align:start position:0%
just just a thought but those those are
 
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:09.600 align:start position:0%
the kind of things I would think of to
 
00:09:11.870 --> 00:09:11.880 align:start position:0%
fund it either from the education trust
 
00:09:14.230 --> 00:09:14.240 align:start position:0%
fund that should not be in Surplus or
 
00:09:17.090 --> 00:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
money is not otherwise appropriated
 
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:20.640 align:start position:0%
and if if we don't see
 
00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:23.940 align:start position:0%
money coming in from this budget this
 
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:26.940 align:start position:0%
term we make the effective date
 
00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:28.620 align:start position:0%
next biennium
 
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:31.440 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you I um thank you Mr chair
 
00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:33.720 align:start position:0%
I'm still concerned about the fact that
 
00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:35.959 align:start position:0%
we are talking about the 100 000 being
 
00:09:38.930 --> 00:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
amount uh you know good enough to
 
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
spearhead the project
 
00:09:44.449 --> 00:09:44.459 align:start position:0%
I I would really like to have an idea of
 
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
I know that we cannot have an exact
 
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:47.940 align:start position:0%
estimate nobody will give you a quote
 
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
for this
 
00:09:52.009 --> 00:09:52.019 align:start position:0%
but without at least some estimate of
 
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:53.820 align:start position:0%
how many years would it take and how
 
00:09:55.610 --> 00:09:55.620 align:start position:0%
much would the overall cost be it's kind
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
of hard for me to justify you know
 
00:09:59.329 --> 00:09:59.339 align:start position:0%
spending a hundred thousand to kind of
 
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:01.800 align:start position:0%
see how we're getting started and then
 
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:03.420 align:start position:0%
come back and see what we're really
 
00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:07.220 align:start position:0%
looking at would it be possible to get a
 
00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:10.800 align:start position:0%
moreover firm you know idea of what we
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
are looking at because it's kind of an
 
00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:13.860 align:start position:0%
open-ended thing and I'm really
 
00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:17.519 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable with open-ended spending
 
00:10:19.250 --> 00:10:19.260 align:start position:0%
I don't think it's open-ended if you
 
00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:21.420 align:start position:0%
start and you know with with a hundred
 
00:10:23.449 --> 00:10:23.459 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars recognizing that the
 
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
very flexible and it will be fluid I do
 
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:33.480 align:start position:0%
think that
 
00:10:35.449 --> 00:10:35.459 align:start position:0%
the project can
 
00:10:35.459 --> 00:10:37.130 align:start position:0%
the project can
certainly

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.140 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to say be completed
 
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:40.380 align:start position:0%
because I'm speaking for someone who's
 
00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:41.880 align:start position:0%
not going to be doing the work I'm not
 
00:10:43.370 --> 00:10:43.380 align:start position:0%
doing the work we would hire someone to
 
00:10:44.449 --> 00:10:44.459 align:start position:0%
do it
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
um but I do think a hundred thousand
 
00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.180 align:start position:0%
dollars is an appropriate amount and I
 
00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:50.459 align:start position:0%
don't say that lightly it is an
 
00:10:52.610 --> 00:10:52.620 align:start position:0%
appropriate amount of money to undertake
 
00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:55.019 align:start position:0%
this project does that mean that it will
 
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:56.820 align:start position:0%
be able to be completed under that
 
00:10:58.190 --> 00:10:58.200 align:start position:0%
amount I certainly hope so and that
 
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300 align:start position:0%
would be my expectation but I'm not here
 
00:11:02.569 --> 00:11:02.579 align:start position:0%
to promise you that either I want to
 
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:04.320 align:start position:0%
recognize and I would be open with this
 
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:07.140 align:start position:0%
committee that that project there is a
 
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:09.600 align:start position:0%
lot to that education law book and there
 
00:11:11.449 --> 00:11:11.459 align:start position:0%
are a lot of areas that I anticipate
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
they will that individual will find that
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
need to be identified and worked on so
 
00:11:20.930 --> 00:11:20.940 align:start position:0%
I'm not here to tell you it's going to
 
00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
just take four months and fifty thousand
 
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
dollars that would be an appropriate
 
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.970 align:start position:0%
dollars that would be an appropriate
testimony

00:11:25.970 --> 00:11:25.980 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:28.500 align:start position:0%
um cool quick follow-up yeah but what
 
00:11:29.870 --> 00:11:29.880 align:start position:0%
you are saying if I understand you
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
correctly is that you think it's
 
00:11:33.410 --> 00:11:33.420 align:start position:0%
possible to complete it within a hundred
 
00:11:35.269 --> 00:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
you just are not comfortable committing
 
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
to we do feel that this may be completed
 
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:40.700 align:start position:0%
this way you're just not sure
 
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:43.860 align:start position:0%
I appreciate that summary I believe that
 
00:11:48.110 --> 00:11:48.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:50.810 --> 00:11:50.820 align:start position:0%
however I will not put my reputation on
 
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:52.620 align:start position:0%
the line to say to you
 
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
we will not be back to ask for more
 
00:11:55.670 --> 00:11:55.680 align:start position:0%
money because then you would look at me
 
00:11:57.829 --> 00:11:57.839 align:start position:0%
and say remember last time you were here
 
00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:00.260 align:start position:0%
you told us what's that you told us
 
00:12:03.949 --> 00:12:03.959 align:start position:0%
exactly and I hate those moments so in
 
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
full transparency
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
um I just want to be clear I think it is
 
00:12:11.210 --> 00:12:11.220 align:start position:0%
a significant undertaking I also think a
 
00:12:12.769 --> 00:12:12.779 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars would be well
 
00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:15.480 align:start position:0%
worth it and could be completed within
 
00:12:17.210 --> 00:12:17.220 align:start position:0%
that time frame and the department will
 
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
be very good stewards of the state's
 
00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
money as the department always seeks to
 
00:12:23.269 --> 00:12:23.279 align:start position:0%
be and we will make it clear in the
 
00:12:24.889 --> 00:12:24.899 align:start position:0%
contract and clear on our oversight of
 
00:12:26.509 --> 00:12:26.519 align:start position:0%
the individual who took on this project
 
00:12:29.449 --> 00:12:29.459 align:start position:0%
this is the expectation thank you I'm
 
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
more concerned about the total cost in
 
00:12:33.050 --> 00:12:33.060 align:start position:0%
the time frame the time frame is can be
 
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:34.800 align:start position:0%
flexible about the cost thank you I
 
00:12:36.949 --> 00:12:36.959 align:start position:0%
really appreciate it thank you
 
00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:40.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Dan um this is really
 
00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:43.440 align:start position:0%
sorely needed I mean as someone who had
 
00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:45.060 align:start position:0%
to work with all those laws there are
 
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:47.220 align:start position:0%
laws that contradict laws and there are
 
00:12:48.949 --> 00:12:48.959 align:start position:0%
a lot of things that are long overdue
 
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:51.540 align:start position:0%
with being fixed so I and I I think the
 
00:12:52.730 --> 00:12:52.740 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand dollars is very
 
00:12:54.949 --> 00:12:54.959 align:start position:0%
reasonable for one person to sit down
 
00:12:56.629 --> 00:12:56.639 align:start position:0%
and go through this
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
um it makes a lot of sense
 
00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:03.600 align:start position:0%
now the one concern I have is there are
 
00:13:06.290 --> 00:13:06.300 align:start position:0%
kind of differences in some of the
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
legislation with the same intent now
 
00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.120 align:start position:0%
when the person is going through all
 
00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:13.320 align:start position:0%
these laws
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
how will they
 
00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:17.940 align:start position:0%
they can't make a decision on what
 
00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:19.620 align:start position:0%
should go and what should stay correct
 
00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
so I'm assuming that they would have a
 
00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:25.019 align:start position:0%
list of things that are questions that
 
00:13:27.170 --> 00:13:27.180 align:start position:0%
the legislature has to answer
 
00:13:29.329 --> 00:13:29.339 align:start position:0%
yeah so what looking at the language and
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
I agree with you
 
00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
um the way we phrased it was to identify
 
00:13:37.430 --> 00:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
okay areas that are duplicative identify
 
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.060 align:start position:0%
areas that are contrary to other
 
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
statutes and then to um you know
 
00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
identify areas that can be Consolidated
 
00:13:46.269 --> 00:13:46.279 align:start position:0%
because that's that's another big area
 
00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:49.200 align:start position:0%
and then to report those findings and
 
00:13:51.889 --> 00:13:51.899 align:start position:0%
recommendations for proposed legislation
 
00:13:53.629 --> 00:13:53.639 align:start position:0%
to the commissioner
 
00:13:56.389 --> 00:13:56.399 align:start position:0%
thank you no intend to change anything
 
00:13:58.550 --> 00:13:58.560 align:start position:0%
it would have to be reviewed by us
 
00:13:58.560 --> 00:13:59.690 align:start position:0%
it would have to be reviewed by us
though

00:13:59.690 --> 00:13:59.700 align:start position:0%
though
 
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
well we would follow the typical
 
00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:04.200 align:start position:0%
legislative process of seeking a sponsor
 
00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:10.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:14.530 --> 00:14:14.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:16.610 --> 00:14:16.620 align:start position:0%
I'll tell you what I'll be in the second
 
00:14:25.670 --> 00:14:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair I uh as you
 
00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:37.910 --> 00:14:37.920 align:start position:0%
okay there we go as you know I came here
 
00:14:40.009 --> 00:14:40.019 align:start position:0%
to speak on 332 and it would have been
 
00:14:42.350 --> 00:14:42.360 align:start position:0%
nice to speak on that but I I do con I
 
00:14:45.829 --> 00:14:45.839 align:start position:0%
do agree that the legislation in general
 
00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
is sort of like spaghetti code and
 
00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:49.500 align:start position:0%
things go from one point to another and
 
00:14:51.470 --> 00:14:51.480 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't it wouldn't be a bad idea to
 
00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:54.680 align:start position:0%
have an attorney go through and sort of
 
00:14:57.590 --> 00:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
identify the things and give you a side
 
00:14:59.889 --> 00:14:59.899 align:start position:0%
by side so that the appropriate
 
00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:02.040 align:start position:0%
committees can review this and decide
 
00:15:04.490 --> 00:15:04.500 align:start position:0%
what changes to make well I what I
 
00:15:07.250 --> 00:15:07.260 align:start position:0%
wanted to say here is is that had the
 
00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:10.260 align:start position:0%
commissioner decided to do this rather
 
00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:12.180 align:start position:0%
than hiring a spokesperson he would have
 
00:15:13.129 --> 00:15:13.139 align:start position:0%
the money
 
00:15:15.650 --> 00:15:15.660 align:start position:0%
and we would be using that because I
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
think this commissioner is very well
 
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:19.320 align:start position:0%
spoken very very a very good
 
00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:22.740 align:start position:0%
communicator and that person that job is
 
00:15:24.410 --> 00:15:24.420 align:start position:0%
probably not necessary to be in our
 
00:15:27.050 --> 00:15:27.060 align:start position:0%
budget which is has remained thank you
 
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:29.220 align:start position:0%
very much
 
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:31.320 align:start position:0%
Okay so
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
what's the yes oh I have some notes from
 
00:15:37.069 --> 00:15:37.079 align:start position:0%
our previous hearings and public
 
00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:40.079 align:start position:0%
testimony that um I believe came from
 
00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:41.940 align:start position:0%
the commissioner himself in regards to
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
page two
 
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:45.290 align:start position:0%
page two
um

00:15:45.290 --> 00:15:45.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:47.449 --> 00:15:47.459 align:start position:0%
subsection three about the reporting
 
00:15:50.870 --> 00:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
mechanism and my note says that he would
 
00:15:52.850 --> 00:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
have preferred
 
00:15:56.689 --> 00:15:56.699 align:start position:0%
um that the report be made
 
00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:58.560 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry the Roman numeral three
 
00:16:01.009 --> 00:16:01.019 align:start position:0%
it's actually the supervisory authority
 
00:16:02.870 --> 00:16:02.880 align:start position:0%
over the attorney
 
00:16:04.430 --> 00:16:04.440 align:start position:0%
it sounds like
 
00:16:06.110 --> 00:16:06.120 align:start position:0%
um the commissioner would have preferred
 
00:16:08.410 --> 00:16:08.420 align:start position:0%
that both the Department of Education
 
00:16:11.689 --> 00:16:11.699 align:start position:0%
and a con to be in charge with in
 
00:16:14.329 --> 00:16:14.339 align:start position:0%
consultation with the AG's office and I
 
00:16:15.470 --> 00:16:15.480 align:start position:0%
have a note here that there was an
 
00:16:17.329 --> 00:16:17.339 align:start position:0%
amendment that they had proposed to come
 
00:16:19.009 --> 00:16:19.019 align:start position:0%
but I don't see that before us today
 
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:21.300 align:start position:0%
either and I just want to make sure you
 
00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:23.160 align:start position:0%
know that we remember there was some
 
00:16:25.129 --> 00:16:25.139 align:start position:0%
need from the Department itself to try
 
00:16:26.810 --> 00:16:26.820 align:start position:0%
to modify what we're looking at today
 
00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:29.100 align:start position:0%
and you know what I also have remaining
 
00:16:30.650 --> 00:16:30.660 align:start position:0%
concerns about the scope but I just
 
00:16:32.509 --> 00:16:32.519 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that
 
00:16:34.069 --> 00:16:34.079 align:start position:0%
um that we remembered that that was
 
00:16:35.389 --> 00:16:35.399 align:start position:0%
important testimony the commissioner
 
00:16:37.490 --> 00:16:37.500 align:start position:0%
shared with us on that day
 
00:16:39.110 --> 00:16:39.120 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:16:43.009 --> 00:16:43.019 align:start position:0%
so moving forward if if the if the
 
00:16:46.430 --> 00:16:46.440 align:start position:0%
committee so decides we can modify we
 
00:16:48.189 --> 00:16:48.199 align:start position:0%
can recommend
 
00:16:51.470 --> 00:16:51.480 align:start position:0%
amendments for full Finance
 
00:16:54.290 --> 00:16:54.300 align:start position:0%
so the rec recommendation one is to
 
00:16:55.790 --> 00:16:55.800 align:start position:0%
change the date
 
00:16:58.189 --> 00:16:58.199 align:start position:0%
the time frame
 
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:00.660 align:start position:0%
as I as I hear the dialogue
 
00:17:03.829 --> 00:17:03.839 align:start position:0%
and the second would be to
 
00:17:07.189 --> 00:17:07.199 align:start position:0%
change the reporting Authority is that
 
00:17:09.470 --> 00:17:09.480 align:start position:0%
I think it's the supervisory supervisory
 
00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:11.640 align:start position:0%
Authority right now it's just under the
 
00:17:13.189 --> 00:17:13.199 align:start position:0%
department itself but I think they
 
00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:15.240 align:start position:0%
wanted to share that in consultation
 
00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:17.579 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general's office
 
00:17:17.579 --> 00:17:19.189 align:start position:0%
with the attorney general's office
okay

00:17:19.189 --> 00:17:19.199 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:20.809 --> 00:17:20.819 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:17:20.819 --> 00:17:22.309 align:start position:0%
all right
and

00:17:22.309 --> 00:17:22.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:17:24.230 --> 00:17:24.240 align:start position:0%
the third one is
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
out of we're going to have to change the
 
00:17:30.049 --> 00:17:30.059 align:start position:0%
funding and make it as a not otherwise
 
00:17:32.210 --> 00:17:32.220 align:start position:0%
allocated or whatever in order or to
 
00:17:33.789 --> 00:17:33.799 align:start position:0%
take it out of the department out of the
 
00:17:38.450 --> 00:17:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
the way the bills was drafted was it it
 
00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:43.260 align:start position:0%
is an education trust fund charge okay
 
00:17:45.830 --> 00:17:45.840 align:start position:0%
then let's leave it alone
 
00:17:47.330 --> 00:17:47.340 align:start position:0%
with those
 
00:17:50.810 --> 00:17:50.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:52.669 --> 00:17:52.679 align:start position:0%
do we have a motion to move this to full
 
00:17:52.679 --> 00:17:54.650 align:start position:0%
do we have a motion to move this to full
Finance

00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:54.660 align:start position:0%

establishing academic research and
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
Improvement performance data analyst in

the Department of Education
 
00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:52.500 align:start position:0%

Grant and make an appropriation
 
00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:08.870 align:start position:0%
Grant and make an appropriation
therefore

00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:10.490 --> 00:20:10.500 align:start position:0%
there's two of us
 
00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:11.830 align:start position:0%

okay
 
00:20:15.409 --> 00:20:15.419 align:start position:0%
so this one was in hb1
 
00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:20.280 align:start position:0%
so uh 541 could be IPL Joe moves it
 
00:20:23.450 --> 00:20:23.460 align:start position:0%
Merry seconds all those in favor
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
okay now we go to 542.
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
establish an academic research and
 
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
improve performance data analysts in the
 
00:20:32.870 --> 00:20:32.880 align:start position:0%
Department of Education which did end up
 
00:20:35.770 --> 00:20:35.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:44.510 --> 00:20:44.520 align:start position:0%
oh I'm sorry I just I just looked down
 
00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:47.280 align:start position:0%
and saw hp2 in parenthesis there
 
00:20:49.190 --> 00:20:49.200 align:start position:0%
when the Department of Education was
 
00:20:51.169 --> 00:20:51.179 align:start position:0%
before Senate Finance during its budget
 
00:20:52.610 --> 00:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
work they didn't identify this position
 
00:20:55.190 --> 00:20:55.200 align:start position:0%
as one of their prioritized needs so the
 
00:20:57.950 --> 00:20:57.960 align:start position:0%
Senate made the pr uh the policy change
 
00:20:59.510 --> 00:20:59.520 align:start position:0%
to the budget that passed over by
 
00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.430 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:10.610 --> 00:21:10.620 align:start position:0%
um move to Ito all right and the second
 
00:21:13.669 --> 00:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
primary all those in favor of Ito
 
00:21:13.679 --> 00:21:16.430 align:start position:0%
primary all those in favor of Ito
okay

00:21:16.430 --> 00:21:16.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:18.289 --> 00:21:18.299 align:start position:0%
all right relative to school building
 
00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:22.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:33.110 --> 00:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:35.810 --> 00:21:35.820 align:start position:0%
we had it in hb1 does anybody want to
 
00:21:43.610 --> 00:21:43.620 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:46.500 align:start position:0%
the same station that's just the same
 
00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:48.360 align:start position:0%
ballpark the same Baltimore same topic
 
00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:49.860 align:start position:0%
which have been kicking down the road
 
00:21:53.029 --> 00:21:53.039 align:start position:0%
for a long time uh and I'm hoping that
 
00:21:54.830 --> 00:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to do now since I knew
 
00:21:56.149 --> 00:21:56.159 align:start position:0%
that I thought this bill would not go
 
00:21:57.890 --> 00:21:57.900 align:start position:0%
anywhere neither will this one I'm
 
00:21:59.750 --> 00:21:59.760 align:start position:0%
trying to find the senator to sponsor
 
00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:02.580 align:start position:0%
something or so that we can get some
 
00:22:03.950 --> 00:22:03.960 align:start position:0%
money into the into the building a
 
00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:06.960 align:start position:0%
program perhaps through the Surplus in
 
00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:09.600 align:start position:0%
the education trust fund and the other
 
00:22:13.250 --> 00:22:13.260 align:start position:0%
large budget surplus we had the money we
 
00:22:15.230 --> 00:22:15.240 align:start position:0%
should spend it we've been ignoring our
 
00:22:18.590 --> 00:22:18.600 align:start position:0%
school buildings far too long and so I'm
 
00:22:20.270 --> 00:22:20.280 align:start position:0%
again I'm expressed by disappointment
 
00:22:21.529 --> 00:22:21.539 align:start position:0%
that the finance committee didn't
 
00:22:24.169 --> 00:22:24.179 align:start position:0%
address this in the budget we don't we
 
00:22:26.690 --> 00:22:26.700 align:start position:0%
did only approved only three out of 17
 
00:22:29.450 --> 00:22:29.460 align:start position:0%
applications and we all know that there
 
00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:30.960 align:start position:0%
are many more schools across the state
 
00:22:33.169 --> 00:22:33.179 align:start position:0%
that need repair and it's only getting
 
00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:37.740 align:start position:0%
worse if we don't act thank you okay
 
00:22:39.529 --> 00:22:39.539 align:start position:0%
but as far as
 
00:22:44.810 --> 00:22:44.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:47.810 --> 00:22:47.820 align:start position:0%
so just a CL just to clarify for
 
00:22:50.690 --> 00:22:50.700 align:start position:0%
everybody this division had three School
 
00:22:51.890 --> 00:22:51.900 align:start position:0%
building Aid bills that made
 
00:22:54.169 --> 00:22:54.179 align:start position:0%
modifications and in most cases applied
 
00:22:55.970 --> 00:22:55.980 align:start position:0%
are appropriated much more money than
 
00:22:58.970 --> 00:22:58.980 align:start position:0%
the current statutory uh maximum of 50
 
00:23:00.590 --> 00:23:00.600 align:start position:0%
million dollars the budget that ended up
 
00:23:03.289 --> 00:23:03.299 align:start position:0%
passing was at the maximum statutory
 
00:23:05.149 --> 00:23:05.159 align:start position:0%
level of 50 million dollars so just to
 
00:23:07.789 --> 00:23:07.799 align:start position:0%
clarify that
 
00:23:10.810 --> 00:23:10.820 align:start position:0%
so there's nothing to do on this bill
 
00:23:13.190 --> 00:23:13.200 align:start position:0%
all right if if you wanted to do
 
00:23:14.630 --> 00:23:14.640 align:start position:0%
anything with these bills you're
 
00:23:16.190 --> 00:23:16.200 align:start position:0%
essentially would be increasing the
 
00:23:18.409 --> 00:23:18.419 align:start position:0%
statutory cap that is in place now in
 
00:23:19.970 --> 00:23:19.980 align:start position:0%
appropriating additional funds for
 
00:23:21.830 --> 00:23:21.840 align:start position:0%
school building a program
 
00:23:24.169 --> 00:23:24.179 align:start position:0%
I would make that Amendment
 
00:23:26.930 --> 00:23:26.940 align:start position:0%
that we increase the statutory limit to
 
00:23:33.049 --> 00:23:33.059 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.210 --> 00:23:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.810 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:43.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
the motion was to increase the statutory
 
00:23:49.010 --> 00:23:49.020 align:start position:0%
limit of school building AIDS and 50
 
00:23:53.770 --> 00:23:53.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
there was a motion uh from uh repetri to
 
00:23:59.630 --> 00:23:59.640 align:start position:0%
it Elite which didn't get seconded and
 
00:24:01.789 --> 00:24:01.799 align:start position:0%
then the piece came in so I just want to
 
00:24:04.190 --> 00:24:04.200 align:start position:0%
make sure we're all aware of it but
 
00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:06.360 align:start position:0%
there was no second correct but I just
 
00:24:08.630 --> 00:24:08.640 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure okay so right right
 
00:24:12.710 --> 00:24:12.720 align:start position:0%
the motion is amendment to propose
 
00:24:14.990 --> 00:24:15.000 align:start position:0%
amendment to increase the statutory
 
00:24:16.930 --> 00:24:16.940 align:start position:0%
limit too yeah
 
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:18.830 align:start position:0%
limit too yeah
70.

00:24:18.830 --> 00:24:18.840 align:start position:0%
70.
 
00:24:21.470 --> 00:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman I've heard from some people
 
00:24:23.750 --> 00:24:23.760 align:start position:0%
that some of the schools that really
 
00:24:25.310 --> 00:24:25.320 align:start position:0%
don't need new buildings because they
 
00:24:28.070 --> 00:24:28.080 align:start position:0%
have decreased enrollment saying oh we
 
00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:29.820 align:start position:0%
could get 60 percent from the state
 
00:24:31.549 --> 00:24:31.559 align:start position:0%
let's build
 
00:24:35.210 --> 00:24:35.220 align:start position:0%
I think this this is bad because you
 
00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:36.480 align:start position:0%
know and especially some of the
 
00:24:38.149 --> 00:24:38.159 align:start position:0%
mismanagement that's happened like in
 
00:24:40.430 --> 00:24:40.440 align:start position:0%
Concord where they give away buildings
 
00:24:43.010 --> 00:24:43.020 align:start position:0%
that they should have sold for cash and
 
00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:45.720 align:start position:0%
then ask us to pay for a new building
 
00:24:48.049 --> 00:24:48.059 align:start position:0%
that's mismanagement and I don't think
 
00:24:49.310 --> 00:24:49.320 align:start position:0%
it's right
 
00:24:51.169 --> 00:24:51.179 align:start position:0%
but if we have this money sitting there
 
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
people are going to build things they
 
00:24:53.690 --> 00:24:53.700 align:start position:0%
don't need because they think they're
 
00:24:55.730 --> 00:24:55.740 align:start position:0%
going to get 60 paid for
 
00:24:57.590 --> 00:24:57.600 align:start position:0%
I'm opposed
 
00:25:00.649 --> 00:25:00.659 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr cheer
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
I respectfully reject your comments I do
 
00:25:07.070 --> 00:25:07.080 align:start position:0%
not believe that school districts are
 
00:25:09.770 --> 00:25:09.780 align:start position:0%
not using their money to the best use
 
00:25:13.190 --> 00:25:13.200 align:start position:0%
possible for any minor amount of money
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
that they get for building Aid we have
 
00:25:17.270 --> 00:25:17.280 align:start position:0%
Amy here today and I'm sure she can
 
00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:18.649 align:start position:0%
Amy here today and I'm sure she can
attest

00:25:18.649 --> 00:25:18.659 align:start position:0%
attest
 
00:25:21.710 --> 00:25:21.720 align:start position:0%
um Concord has the pre prerogative to
 
00:25:24.409 --> 00:25:24.419 align:start position:0%
make decisions and they don't do it in
 
00:25:26.450 --> 00:25:26.460 align:start position:0%
absence of anyone they've done a good
 
00:25:28.549 --> 00:25:28.559 align:start position:0%
job building what they need to build for
 
00:25:31.070 --> 00:25:31.080 align:start position:0%
the in the best interest of students but
 
00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:33.120 align:start position:0%
I really and truly think that this is a
 
00:25:35.029 --> 00:25:35.039 align:start position:0%
need that we've had we've been ignoring
 
00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:38.220 align:start position:0%
our schools we had a 10-year moratorium
 
00:25:41.029 --> 00:25:41.039 align:start position:0%
we need more money in building Aid we
 
00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
tried during the budget process we were
 
00:25:45.830 --> 00:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
unable to do it I think lifting the
 
00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860 align:start position:0%
amount the statutory maximum amount is a
 
00:25:52.850 --> 00:25:52.860 align:start position:0%
simple step to go forward and I would
 
00:25:54.350 --> 00:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
hope that everyone would support it
 
00:25:55.430 --> 00:25:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:58.370 --> 00:25:58.380 align:start position:0%
so raising the statutory to 70 million
 
00:25:59.930 --> 00:25:59.940 align:start position:0%
means every
 
00:26:02.029 --> 00:26:02.039 align:start position:0%
succeeding budget 70 million not just
 
00:26:04.190 --> 00:26:04.200 align:start position:0%
this one
 
00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:06.240 align:start position:0%
right yes
 
00:26:08.269 --> 00:26:08.279 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I would just like to
 
00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:09.960 align:start position:0%
Echo or add that the Department of
 
00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
Education has substantive procedures for
 
00:26:14.870 --> 00:26:14.880 align:start position:0%
granting School building Aid and I think
 
00:26:16.130 --> 00:26:16.140 align:start position:0%
that they've shown that they do a very
 
00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
good job at that and I think I have
 
00:26:20.090 --> 00:26:20.100 align:start position:0%
trust in the program that they have in
 
00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:22.020 align:start position:0%
terms of awarding the the money it is
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
not done in a willy nilly willy-nilly is
 
00:26:25.669 --> 00:26:25.679 align:start position:0%
that the phrase fashion that's been
 
00:26:28.909 --> 00:26:28.919 align:start position:0%
suggested so I support their proposal
 
00:26:28.919 --> 00:26:30.110 align:start position:0%
suggested so I support their proposal
okay

00:26:30.110 --> 00:26:30.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:26:33.470 --> 00:26:33.480 align:start position:0%
yes sir thank you very much Mr chair uh
 
00:26:34.850 --> 00:26:34.860 align:start position:0%
I want to point out that the average
 
00:26:38.690 --> 00:26:38.700 align:start position:0%
building a grant is 38 that leaves uh
 
00:26:41.750 --> 00:26:41.760 align:start position:0%
let me think 62 percent uh skin in the
 
00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:43.200 align:start position:0%
game for the local community they have
 
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
to come up with the rest of that money
 
00:26:46.730 --> 00:26:46.740 align:start position:0%
and you're not you're not qualified for
 
00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.320 align:start position:0%
for the 60 unless you're unless your
 
00:26:51.590 --> 00:26:51.600 align:start position:0%
community is dirt poor and they're
 
00:26:52.970 --> 00:26:52.980 align:start position:0%
certainly not going to be willing to put
 
00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
up the 40 if they don't have it plenty
 
00:26:58.970 --> 00:26:58.980 align:start position:0%
of illustrations of this uh my good
 
00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:01.320 align:start position:0%
friend Mr Weiler has a point of view but
 
00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:03.240 align:start position:0%
I I have to say he's not looking at the
 
00:27:05.090 --> 00:27:05.100 align:start position:0%
whole picture and we've seen a lot of
 
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
these sort of pictures around the state
 
00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
with schools that are crumbling we've uh
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
We've bought a new building for the
 
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:13.860 align:start position:0%
education department which I certainly
 
00:27:15.350 --> 00:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
don't want anyone working for the
 
00:27:16.909 --> 00:27:16.919 align:start position:0%
education department sitting in a
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
building with asbestos and lead paint
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
but we have kids in school under those
 
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:27.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:30.409 --> 00:27:30.419 align:start position:0%
okay there's a motion on the floor to
 
00:27:32.810 --> 00:27:32.820 align:start position:0%
amend the bill
 
00:27:36.110 --> 00:27:36.120 align:start position:0%
the statutory limit yes can I just
 
00:27:38.029 --> 00:27:38.039 align:start position:0%
clarify one thing so I believe this
 
00:27:39.590 --> 00:27:39.600 align:start position:0%
motion is to make no other changes
 
00:27:41.330 --> 00:27:41.340 align:start position:0%
except for changing the 50 million to
 
00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:43.740 align:start position:0%
70. and Amy Clark can back me up here
 
00:27:45.409 --> 00:27:45.419 align:start position:0%
but I think you would want to make that
 
00:27:48.169 --> 00:27:48.179 align:start position:0%
effective date July 1 2025 I feel like
 
00:27:50.630 --> 00:27:50.640 align:start position:0%
this biennium has already closed off so
 
00:27:53.149 --> 00:27:53.159 align:start position:0%
I don't know if if Amy wants to comment
 
00:27:55.789 --> 00:27:55.799 align:start position:0%
on the timing of making such a change uh
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
mid-mid cycle
 
00:27:59.870 --> 00:27:59.880 align:start position:0%
is that is that correct
 
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:02.400 align:start position:0%
okay so I'd say if this motion should
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
also include an effective date of uh
 
00:28:08.990 --> 00:28:09.000 align:start position:0%
July 1 2025. okay
 
00:28:10.909 --> 00:28:10.919 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:18.470 --> 00:28:18.480 align:start position:0%
any other further comment
 
00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:23.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:28.970 --> 00:28:28.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:32.630 --> 00:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
five so the amendment fails I could have
 
00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:34.100 align:start position:0%
a moment
 
00:28:36.890 --> 00:28:36.900 align:start position:0%
so now for the
 
00:28:39.649 --> 00:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
Bill itself
 
00:28:41.269 --> 00:28:41.279 align:start position:0%
lost my place
 
00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:46.789 align:start position:0%
lost my place

00:28:46.789 --> 00:28:46.799 align:start position:0%

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:52.740 align:start position:0%
recommend itl
 
00:28:52.740 --> 00:28:53.930 align:start position:0%
recommend itl

00:29:10.390 --> 00:29:10.400 align:start position:0%
my apologies
 
00:29:13.730 --> 00:29:13.740 align:start position:0%

students so they took out the Medicaid
 
00:30:25.730 --> 00:30:25.740 align:start position:0%
direct cert and passed an enhanced
 
00:30:27.230 --> 00:30:27.240 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant starting in
 
00:30:30.590 --> 00:30:30.600 align:start position:0%
fiscal 26 instead the department is here
 
00:30:32.330 --> 00:30:32.340 align:start position:0%
if there's any follow-ups but my
 
00:30:34.250 --> 00:30:34.260 align:start position:0%
understanding is the USDA did not even
 
00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:37.320 align:start position:0%
open up an application period for 23 so
 
00:30:39.169 --> 00:30:39.179 align:start position:0%
had that bill passed I don't think the
 
00:30:40.850 --> 00:30:40.860 align:start position:0%
department could have pursued a direct
 
00:30:42.710 --> 00:30:42.720 align:start position:0%
start application this year anyways and
 
00:30:46.250 --> 00:30:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:52.130 --> 00:30:52.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:54.590 --> 00:30:54.600 align:start position:0%
um thank you I'm I'm Brody deshais I
 
00:30:56.029 --> 00:30:56.039 align:start position:0%
represent New Hampshire hunger Solutions
 
00:30:58.909 --> 00:30:58.919 align:start position:0%
and we've been strong advocates for
 
00:31:01.190 --> 00:31:01.200 align:start position:0%
passing this legislation so I just want
 
00:31:04.490 --> 00:31:04.500 align:start position:0%
to First say the fed's pilot program is
 
00:31:06.289 --> 00:31:06.299 align:start position:0%
still open states can still join the
 
00:31:08.149 --> 00:31:08.159 align:start position:0%
pilot program for Medicaid direct
 
00:31:10.850 --> 00:31:10.860 align:start position:0%
certification to my understanding if the
 
00:31:12.590 --> 00:31:12.600 align:start position:0%
department wants to clarify as if I
 
00:31:13.909 --> 00:31:13.919 align:start position:0%
missed if we missed something from Nam
 
00:31:15.649 --> 00:31:15.659 align:start position:0%
stronger Solutions in our end a federal
 
00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:18.120 align:start position:0%
policy that changed that could be the
 
00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559 align:start position:0%
case but usually we're watching Pretty
 
00:31:22.370 --> 00:31:22.380 align:start position:0%
closely so essentially what how spill
 
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
601 would do would it would require the
 
00:31:26.570 --> 00:31:26.580 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to opt into the
 
00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:27.769 align:start position:0%
Department of Education to opt into the
federal

00:31:27.769 --> 00:31:27.779 align:start position:0%
federal
 
00:31:30.590 --> 00:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
um into the federal pilot program and
 
00:31:32.090 --> 00:31:32.100 align:start position:0%
what that would do is it would make it
 
00:31:33.590 --> 00:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
so then the state automatically
 
00:31:35.810 --> 00:31:35.820 align:start position:0%
certifies students who partake in
 
00:31:35.820 --> 00:31:37.130 align:start position:0%
certifies students who partake in
Medicaid

00:31:37.130 --> 00:31:37.140 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
 
00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:37.930 align:start position:0%
Medicaid
um

00:31:37.930 --> 00:31:37.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:41.090 --> 00:31:41.100 align:start position:0%
to get free and reduced meals similar to
 
00:31:43.190 --> 00:31:43.200 align:start position:0%
what we already do for snaps so families
 
00:31:44.930 --> 00:31:44.940 align:start position:0%
up or taking the snap program are
 
00:31:46.190 --> 00:31:46.200 align:start position:0%
automatically certified for free
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
introduced meals so this would capture
 
00:31:49.610 --> 00:31:49.620 align:start position:0%
another 10 000 students that aren't
 
00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
accounted for
 
00:31:52.490 --> 00:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
um in the state of New Hampshire the
 
00:31:55.490 --> 00:31:55.500 align:start position:0%
Senate's big issue with the bill wasn't
 
00:31:57.590 --> 00:31:57.600 align:start position:0%
the intent and it wasn't the cost to the
 
00:31:59.269 --> 00:31:59.279 align:start position:0%
department it was the fact that it
 
00:32:01.970 --> 00:32:01.980 align:start position:0%
affected the um the adequacy aid
 
00:32:03.649 --> 00:32:03.659 align:start position:0%
provided to school districts because you
 
00:32:05.210 --> 00:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
have more students that will become
 
00:32:06.830 --> 00:32:06.840 align:start position:0%
enrolled in free introduced lunch about
 
00:32:09.710 --> 00:32:09.720 align:start position:0%
10 000 more students namschanger
 
00:32:11.630 --> 00:32:11.640 align:start position:0%
Solutions has kind of held the position
 
00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:14.460 align:start position:0%
that not only is this a bill related to
 
00:32:16.250 --> 00:32:16.260 align:start position:0%
feeding students an increasing number of
 
00:32:18.110 --> 00:32:18.120 align:start position:0%
students who are partaking in free and
 
00:32:20.090 --> 00:32:20.100 align:start position:0%
reduced meals it's also a bill that
 
00:32:22.549 --> 00:32:22.559 align:start position:0%
helps communities recapture state aid
 
00:32:24.549 --> 00:32:24.559 align:start position:0%
that frankly they have a right to
 
00:32:27.289 --> 00:32:27.299 align:start position:0%
property taxpayers are affected when
 
00:32:28.669 --> 00:32:28.679 align:start position:0%
people don't fill out these applications
 
00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
and you have tens of millions of dollars
 
00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:33.840 align:start position:0%
left on the table because you have some
 
00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:34.860 align:start position:0%
families that aren't filling out the
 
00:32:37.130 --> 00:32:37.140 align:start position:0%
applications for a myriad of reasons but
 
00:32:38.750 --> 00:32:38.760 align:start position:0%
ultimately it's property taxpayers and
 
00:32:40.490 --> 00:32:40.500 align:start position:0%
school districts that miss out on these
 
00:32:42.049 --> 00:32:42.059 align:start position:0%
funds and the students have partaken for
 
00:32:45.169 --> 00:32:45.179 align:start position:0%
introduced meals tend to have more needs
 
00:32:46.610 --> 00:32:46.620 align:start position:0%
that must be provided by the school
 
00:32:49.310 --> 00:32:49.320 align:start position:0%
district so it's kind of um we're kind
 
00:32:51.049 --> 00:32:51.059 align:start position:0%
of dealing with two issues here one is a
 
00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:52.380 align:start position:0%
school funding issue and another one is
 
00:32:54.289 --> 00:32:54.299 align:start position:0%
an issue of feeding students
 
00:32:57.889 --> 00:32:57.899 align:start position:0%
so but we're strategically in going at
 
00:32:59.330 --> 00:32:59.340 align:start position:0%
this is going in a different direction
 
00:33:02.029 --> 00:33:02.039 align:start position:0%
than the Senate wants to go
 
00:33:04.430 --> 00:33:04.440 align:start position:0%
as a larger question
 
00:33:05.690 --> 00:33:05.700 align:start position:0%
is it
 
00:33:10.970 --> 00:33:10.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:12.120 align:start position:0%
um could you clarify your question
 
00:33:15.110 --> 00:33:15.120 align:start position:0%
representative we passed this for all
 
00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:17.880 align:start position:0%
the reasons you just said and the Senate
 
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:19.380 align:start position:0%
took it out for a whole bunch of reasons
 
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:20.460 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:33:22.430 --> 00:33:22.440 align:start position:0%
are there reasonably going to change if
 
00:33:24.470 --> 00:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
we we introduce this
 
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
I'm not entirely sure I can't speak to
 
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
what the Senate would decide or how
 
00:33:29.870 --> 00:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
they're feeling in this upcoming year
 
00:33:32.269 --> 00:33:32.279 align:start position:0%
but I can say you guys never got the
 
00:33:34.190 --> 00:33:34.200 align:start position:0%
entire fiscal note
 
00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
um because it wasn't finalized when you
 
00:33:37.730 --> 00:33:37.740 align:start position:0%
guys went through it it was finalized
 
00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:39.059 align:start position:0%
when the Senate went through it and when
 
00:33:41.169 --> 00:33:41.179 align:start position:0%
you originally looked at the fiscal note
 
00:33:45.049 --> 00:33:45.059 align:start position:0%
there wasn't there there wasn't um
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
there weren't estimates based on the
 
00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:48.480 align:start position:0%
number of students that would be
 
00:33:51.049 --> 00:33:51.059 align:start position:0%
enrolled and that would then be counted
 
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:52.500 align:start position:0%
in the free and reduced numbers for the
 
00:33:55.009 --> 00:33:55.019 align:start position:0%
state advocacy formula
 
00:33:56.870 --> 00:33:56.880 align:start position:0%
so at that time we thought the fiscal
 
00:33:58.430 --> 00:33:58.440 align:start position:0%
note might be a lot smaller it ended up
 
00:34:00.169 --> 00:34:00.179 align:start position:0%
becoming much larger
 
00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:02.460 align:start position:0%
um so I guess your committee now has a
 
00:34:03.950 --> 00:34:03.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot more information out there
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
for you guys to make a another decision
 
00:34:08.149 --> 00:34:08.159 align:start position:0%
on this bill of whether or not
 
00:34:09.770 --> 00:34:09.780 align:start position:0%
you know you want to directly certified
 
00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
you want you want the direct the
 
00:34:13.669 --> 00:34:13.679 align:start position:0%
department to partake in the federal
 
00:34:16.250 --> 00:34:16.260 align:start position:0%
government's pilot program directly
 
00:34:18.770 --> 00:34:18.780 align:start position:0%
certify students who are on Medicaid and
 
00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:20.280 align:start position:0%
free and reduced meals
 
00:34:23.930 --> 00:34:23.940 align:start position:0%
and this had a cost didn't it
 
00:34:27.230 --> 00:34:27.240 align:start position:0%
yeah Mary what I believe happened in the
 
00:34:27.240 --> 00:34:28.129 align:start position:0%
yeah Mary what I believe happened in the
Senate

00:34:28.129 --> 00:34:28.139 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:31.379 align:start position:0%
they were for this until they changed
 
00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
the Mickey correct me if I'm wrong they
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
changed the formula so that when the
 
00:34:39.530 --> 00:34:39.540 align:start position:0%
they doubled the amount that would go
 
00:34:42.829 --> 00:34:42.839 align:start position:0%
for f in our students and so when they
 
00:34:46.010 --> 00:34:46.020 align:start position:0%
did the calculations for the number the
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
total number of direct certification
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
students it would have increased the
 
00:34:54.169 --> 00:34:54.179 align:start position:0%
budget by 100 million dollars and at
 
00:34:56.329 --> 00:34:56.339 align:start position:0%
that point in time they determined that
 
00:34:58.730 --> 00:34:58.740 align:start position:0%
they didn't want to go forward with that
 
00:35:01.250 --> 00:35:01.260 align:start position:0%
that being said I think we're doing a
 
00:35:04.490 --> 00:35:04.500 align:start position:0%
disservice to our state and our children
 
00:35:07.430 --> 00:35:07.440 align:start position:0%
we have I believe we have an obligation
 
00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:10.140 align:start position:0%
to identify all the students in New
 
00:35:12.829 --> 00:35:12.839 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are eligible for a frame
 
00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:15.420 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch we all know that they're
 
00:35:18.170 --> 00:35:18.180 align:start position:0%
reluctant to fill out the forms
 
00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:18.950 align:start position:0%
reluctant to fill out the forms
um

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:22.910 --> 00:35:22.920 align:start position:0%
Joe you know your wife you did that job
 
00:35:24.290 --> 00:35:24.300 align:start position:0%
um and there are children in New
 
00:35:26.690 --> 00:35:26.700 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that are going hungry our
 
00:35:29.450 --> 00:35:29.460 align:start position:0%
poorest of families are our young young
 
00:35:31.970 --> 00:35:31.980 align:start position:0%
families and those are the children that
 
00:35:35.450 --> 00:35:35.460 align:start position:0%
would qualify for this food uh food
 
00:35:38.210 --> 00:35:38.220 align:start position:0%
um Surplus a question for you
 
00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.530 align:start position:0%
um Surplus a question for you
um

00:35:39.530 --> 00:35:39.540 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:43.849 --> 00:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
when this law was established Medicaid
 
00:35:46.730 --> 00:35:46.740 align:start position:0%
wasn't in place
 
00:35:49.550 --> 00:35:49.560 align:start position:0%
um they had so that the
 
00:35:52.069 --> 00:35:52.079 align:start position:0%
children that were on other
 
00:35:52.079 --> 00:35:52.910 align:start position:0%
children that were on other
um

00:35:52.910 --> 00:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
programs were automatically eligible
 
00:35:57.710 --> 00:35:57.720 align:start position:0%
because it wasn't in the law now
 
00:36:00.470 --> 00:36:00.480 align:start position:0%
Medicaid wasn't in the law at that time
 
00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:02.700 align:start position:0%
that's why we are in this predicament
 
00:36:05.210 --> 00:36:05.220 align:start position:0%
we're in right now is there any
 
00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:08.040 align:start position:0%
opportunity in Congress in the Senate
 
00:36:11.510 --> 00:36:11.520 align:start position:0%
the U.S to change that and include
 
00:36:13.970 --> 00:36:13.980 align:start position:0%
Medicaid in that National piece of
 
00:36:16.190 --> 00:36:16.200 align:start position:0%
legislation so we wouldn't have to do
 
00:36:18.230 --> 00:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
this state by state thing that we we
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
have to do
 
00:36:21.650 --> 00:36:21.660 align:start position:0%
well I think even for the direct
 
00:36:23.750 --> 00:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
certification for snap the state still
 
00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:25.619 align:start position:0%
had to partake in the program all right
 
00:36:27.650 --> 00:36:27.660 align:start position:0%
they had to adopt it yeah okay so I mean
 
00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:29.220 align:start position:0%
and that's and that's I mean that's you
 
00:36:31.130 --> 00:36:31.140 align:start position:0%
know if if they had done Medicaid and
 
00:36:33.109 --> 00:36:33.119 align:start position:0%
snap at the same time probably when this
 
00:36:34.370 --> 00:36:34.380 align:start position:0%
state you know did this direct
 
00:36:36.770 --> 00:36:36.780 align:start position:0%
certification for snap you know it would
 
00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099 align:start position:0%
have been more likely to have done it
 
00:36:40.730 --> 00:36:40.740 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid too but you know the feds
 
00:36:43.250 --> 00:36:43.260 align:start position:0%
to my understanding did snap first then
 
00:36:45.349 --> 00:36:45.359 align:start position:0%
Medicaid so that's you know that's why
 
00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
we've pushed for this legislation I want
 
00:36:48.589 --> 00:36:48.599 align:start position:0%
to clarify though the fiscal note
 
00:36:50.569 --> 00:36:50.579 align:start position:0%
at least to my understanding the fiscal
 
00:36:52.730 --> 00:36:52.740 align:start position:0%
note that was on the Senate side showed
 
00:36:54.589 --> 00:36:54.599 align:start position:0%
somewhere roughly between 60 and 70
 
00:36:57.470 --> 00:36:57.480 align:start position:0%
million but we kind of really questioned
 
00:36:58.670 --> 00:36:58.680 align:start position:0%
whether or not that was a totally
 
00:37:00.349 --> 00:37:00.359 align:start position:0%
accurate fiscal note that's at least
 
00:37:01.970 --> 00:37:01.980 align:start position:0%
from our perspective as an organization
 
00:37:03.829 --> 00:37:03.839 align:start position:0%
we came much closer when we did
 
00:37:06.650 --> 00:37:06.660 align:start position:0%
estimates based on the numbers so based
 
00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
on the um the average daily membership
 
00:37:12.109 --> 00:37:12.119 align:start position:0%
in Residence of students without and
 
00:37:13.790 --> 00:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
then with Medicaid you know the number
 
00:37:15.829 --> 00:37:15.839 align:start position:0%
of meals provided for free and reduced
 
00:37:17.750 --> 00:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
meals we found it was about ten thousand
 
00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:19.560 align:start position:0%
students across the state and that cost
 
00:37:20.890 --> 00:37:20.900 align:start position:0%
to the state
 
00:37:23.210 --> 00:37:23.220 align:start position:0%
specifically the education trust fund
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
would hover somewhere between we said
 
00:37:27.650 --> 00:37:27.660 align:start position:0%
about 27 million and 30 million is some
 
00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:28.740 align:start position:0%
of the estimates that we have internally
 
00:37:30.230 --> 00:37:30.240 align:start position:0%
and I can provide the committee with
 
00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:32.520 align:start position:0%
those estimates and be more than happy
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
to have you know a continued discussion
 
00:37:35.810 --> 00:37:35.820 align:start position:0%
another thing we've talked about with
 
00:37:38.569 --> 00:37:38.579 align:start position:0%
the Senate that we floated was doing a
 
00:37:40.550 --> 00:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
you know a more limited pilot program
 
00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:42.180 align:start position:0%
for the state so choosing communities
 
00:37:43.730 --> 00:37:43.740 align:start position:0%
that have the highest percentage of snap
 
00:37:45.290 --> 00:37:45.300 align:start position:0%
enrollment where we know that there's
 
00:37:47.329 --> 00:37:47.339 align:start position:0%
food insecurity and maybe choosing the
 
00:37:49.849 --> 00:37:49.859 align:start position:0%
top 10 or 15 towns and seeing how the
 
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
cost would impact the state and then
 
00:37:53.210 --> 00:37:53.220 align:start position:0%
address this again in the next budget
 
00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
cycle or pass this currently but have it
 
00:37:58.550 --> 00:37:58.560 align:start position:0%
go into effect and during the next
 
00:38:00.470 --> 00:38:00.480 align:start position:0%
budget cycle too so the committee could
 
00:38:02.210 --> 00:38:02.220 align:start position:0%
you know reevaluate when they go over
 
00:38:03.890 --> 00:38:03.900 align:start position:0%
hb2 next year
 
00:38:06.589 --> 00:38:06.599 align:start position:0%
you can do things first as a clerk could
 
00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:07.680 align:start position:0%
you repeat your name and your
 
00:38:09.230 --> 00:38:09.240 align:start position:0%
organization because I didn't catch you
 
00:38:11.450 --> 00:38:11.460 align:start position:0%
the first time uh Brody deschase would
 
00:38:13.490 --> 00:38:13.500 align:start position:0%
you like me to spell that no I had that
 
00:38:14.990 --> 00:38:15.000 align:start position:0%
I'm pleasantly surprised in the
 
00:38:17.030 --> 00:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
organization uh New Hampshire hunger
 
00:38:20.210 --> 00:38:20.220 align:start position:0%
Solutions see I focused on the name and
 
00:38:23.150 --> 00:38:23.160 align:start position:0%
there was no room left in the short-term
 
00:38:25.490 --> 00:38:25.500 align:start position:0%
memory for the organization and if I
 
00:38:28.970 --> 00:38:28.980 align:start position:0%
could just ask a quick question
 
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.260 align:start position:0%
my understanding and I have to confess
 
00:38:32.870 --> 00:38:32.880 align:start position:0%
that I didn't really follow exactly what
 
00:38:35.930 --> 00:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
the Senate did here is that the senate
 
00:38:38.630 --> 00:38:38.640 align:start position:0%
had the choice to allocate money this
 
00:38:40.730 --> 00:38:40.740 align:start position:0%
way but instead they chose to put money
 
00:38:43.190 --> 00:38:43.200 align:start position:0%
in a different funding formula with the
 
00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:46.500 align:start position:0%
intent of targeting roughly the same
 
00:38:50.569 --> 00:38:50.579 align:start position:0%
population or a population they felt
 
00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:52.980 align:start position:0%
am I understanding this correctly or
 
00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:54.920 align:start position:0%
what did you say about the final
 
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
processor so as as rep Heath mentioned
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
they increased the amount of money
 
00:39:02.630 --> 00:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
provided per pupil in the adequacy
 
00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:04.500 align:start position:0%
formula for students enrolled in free
 
00:39:06.530 --> 00:39:06.540 align:start position:0%
and reduced meals now we're trying to
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
get more students this still ultimately
 
00:39:09.530 --> 00:39:09.540 align:start position:0%
is trying to get more students enrolled
 
00:39:11.690 --> 00:39:11.700 align:start position:0%
in for introduced meals so fiscal note
 
00:39:13.609 --> 00:39:13.619 align:start position:0%
increase so this bill is trying to feed
 
00:39:15.650 --> 00:39:15.660 align:start position:0%
more students but it has an impact on
 
00:39:17.750 --> 00:39:17.760 align:start position:0%
the adequacy aid formula and has the
 
00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.200 align:start position:0%
adequacy aid formula as we know was
 
00:39:20.569 --> 00:39:20.579 align:start position:0%
really overhauled
 
00:39:22.670 --> 00:39:22.680 align:start position:0%
um this session you know it's it changed
 
00:39:24.410 --> 00:39:24.420 align:start position:0%
the price tag for this piece of
 
00:39:27.050 --> 00:39:27.060 align:start position:0%
legislation understood thank you go
 
00:39:27.060 --> 00:39:27.829 align:start position:0%
legislation understood thank you go
ahead

00:39:27.829 --> 00:39:27.839 align:start position:0%
ahead
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
um I'd like to move OTL on this bill uh
 
00:39:32.930 --> 00:39:32.940 align:start position:0%
to pass rather
 
00:39:35.390 --> 00:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
um on this bill so that we can move
 
00:39:37.250 --> 00:39:37.260 align:start position:0%
forward with the Medicaid direct
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
certification at the New Hampshire
 
00:39:41.030 --> 00:39:41.040 align:start position:0%
Department of Education
 
00:39:43.849 --> 00:39:43.859 align:start position:0%
um and it would not be with everything
 
00:39:46.670 --> 00:39:46.680 align:start position:0%
that have to be would have to be done it
 
00:39:48.950 --> 00:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
wouldn't even be effective probably once
 
00:39:51.890 --> 00:39:51.900 align:start position:0%
they have the data until probably 2026
 
00:39:56.150 --> 00:39:56.160 align:start position:0%
is what I understand but at least
 
00:39:59.329 --> 00:39:59.339 align:start position:0%
we'd have an accurate number an accurate
 
00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:01.380 align:start position:0%
number of the children in the state of
 
00:40:03.410 --> 00:40:03.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire that are eligible that
 
00:40:05.510 --> 00:40:05.520 align:start position:0%
should be eligible for reduced lunches
 
00:40:08.210 --> 00:40:08.220 align:start position:0%
and will also have a more accurate
 
00:40:11.390 --> 00:40:11.400 align:start position:0%
number for our adequacy figures because
 
00:40:14.329 --> 00:40:14.339 align:start position:0%
we'll know exactly how many children fnr
 
00:40:16.609 --> 00:40:16.619 align:start position:0%
because right now we only know the
 
00:40:19.370 --> 00:40:19.380 align:start position:0%
numbers of those families who fill out
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
the paperwork we don't have any other
 
00:40:23.870 --> 00:40:23.880 align:start position:0%
way of knowing because we don't have the
 
00:40:25.910 --> 00:40:25.920 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification so we're
 
00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:27.420 align:start position:0%
missing hundreds and hundreds of
 
00:40:29.450 --> 00:40:29.460 align:start position:0%
children and um
 
00:40:31.970 --> 00:40:31.980 align:start position:0%
that's my rationale for moving this to
 
00:40:34.609 --> 00:40:34.619 align:start position:0%
pass now does it would it need to be
 
00:40:34.619 --> 00:40:36.170 align:start position:0%
pass now does it would it need to be
amended

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:36.180 align:start position:0%
amended
 
00:40:43.569 --> 00:40:43.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:46.430 --> 00:40:46.440 align:start position:0%
yeah it probably doesn't need to be
 
00:40:47.990 --> 00:40:48.000 align:start position:0%
effective you probably could just pass
 
00:40:49.730 --> 00:40:49.740 align:start position:0%
this without Amendment
 
00:40:52.430 --> 00:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
um okay there's no there's no dates
 
00:40:54.589 --> 00:40:54.599 align:start position:0%
locked in uh in the bill and it's
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
effective upon passage so does it have
 
00:40:59.210 --> 00:40:59.220 align:start position:0%
money in it
 
00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.609 align:start position:0%
money in it
so

00:41:01.609 --> 00:41:01.619 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:41:03.770 --> 00:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
at the at the end of the budget session
 
00:41:05.930 --> 00:41:05.940 align:start position:0%
when the Senate was working with their
 
00:41:08.390 --> 00:41:08.400 align:start position:0%
education funding changes as well as the
 
00:41:10.089 --> 00:41:10.099 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct certification decision
 
00:41:13.130 --> 00:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
they did in fiscal 26 so the first two
 
00:41:15.170 --> 00:41:15.180 align:start position:0%
years after the budget passed so it's
 
00:41:17.089 --> 00:41:17.099 align:start position:0%
called 24 and 25 the extraordinary needs
 
00:41:20.270 --> 00:41:20.280 align:start position:0%
Grant was maxed out at 8 500.
 
00:41:23.030 --> 00:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
in fiscal 26 and each thereafter when
 
00:41:24.890 --> 00:41:24.900 align:start position:0%
the house passed its budget that's when
 
00:41:26.210 --> 00:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
Medicaid direct cert was going to kick
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
in rather than do that the Senate
 
00:41:30.230 --> 00:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
increased the max grant for the
 
00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:31.740 align:start position:0%
extraordinary needs Grant to eleven
 
00:41:33.710 --> 00:41:33.720 align:start position:0%
thousand five hundred dollars so
 
00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:37.020 align:start position:0%
layering Medicaid direct certification
 
00:41:39.050 --> 00:41:39.060 align:start position:0%
on to the current Formula that's in
 
00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:41.640 align:start position:0%
place in fiscal 27 let's say is the
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
first year that adequacy will be
 
00:41:44.569 --> 00:41:44.579 align:start position:0%
impacted it'd be well over 100 million
 
00:41:46.190 --> 00:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
dollars I would say in that in that one
 
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:48.180 align:start position:0%
year that the estimate that we had back
 
00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:50.820 align:start position:0%
during the session was 109 million and
 
00:41:52.550 --> 00:41:52.560 align:start position:0%
the fiscal 24
 
00:41:54.589 --> 00:41:54.599 align:start position:0%
uh free and reduced lunch data that
 
00:41:55.790 --> 00:41:55.800 align:start position:0%
ended up getting published a couple
 
00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:57.420 align:start position:0%
weeks ago by the department was a little
 
00:41:58.910 --> 00:41:58.920 align:start position:0%
bit higher than what we were using and
 
00:42:01.430 --> 00:42:01.440 align:start position:0%
during the budget so I'd say that based
 
00:42:03.650 --> 00:42:03.660 align:start position:0%
on doe and our estimates that's my
 
00:42:05.150 --> 00:42:05.160 align:start position:0%
worries Mr chairman could ask a
 
00:42:06.349 --> 00:42:06.359 align:start position:0%
clarification question about that
 
00:42:09.050 --> 00:42:09.060 align:start position:0%
estimate sure does that include
 
00:42:11.630 --> 00:42:11.640 align:start position:0%
um the cost the does that include the
 
00:42:13.370 --> 00:42:13.380 align:start position:0%
increased so that fiscal note does that
 
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:15.000 align:start position:0%
include the increased revenue from the
 
00:42:16.910 --> 00:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
federal government for the
 
00:42:18.890 --> 00:42:18.900 align:start position:0%
reimbursements for free meals and
 
00:42:20.630 --> 00:42:20.640 align:start position:0%
reduced price meals this this is just
 
00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
State adequacy trust funding and that's
 
00:42:24.770 --> 00:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
what that's what the committee needs to
 
00:42:26.810 --> 00:42:26.820 align:start position:0%
remember is these meals are reimbursed
 
00:42:28.849 --> 00:42:28.859 align:start position:0%
by the federal government so there is
 
00:42:30.770 --> 00:42:30.780 align:start position:0%
revenues that will come in so while it
 
00:42:33.170 --> 00:42:33.180 align:start position:0%
says 109 million there's a lot of money
 
00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:34.200 align:start position:0%
that comes in from the federal
 
00:42:37.430 --> 00:42:37.440 align:start position:0%
government to fund the program so it
 
00:42:38.810 --> 00:42:38.820 align:start position:0%
looks like the state's spending 109
 
00:42:40.849 --> 00:42:40.859 align:start position:0%
million but you don't see in the
 
00:42:41.870 --> 00:42:41.880 align:start position:0%
background the federal government
 
00:42:44.569 --> 00:42:44.579 align:start position:0%
kicking in a bunch of money for these
 
00:42:46.730 --> 00:42:46.740 align:start position:0%
meals so that would be the new nutrition
 
00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
reimbursement right we're talking about
 
00:42:50.270 --> 00:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
just adequacy is a hundred I'm not that
 
00:42:52.190 --> 00:42:52.200 align:start position:0%
we do have a separate estimate for the
 
00:42:53.990 --> 00:42:54.000 align:start position:0%
nutrition match part of it and that's
 
00:42:56.690 --> 00:42:56.700 align:start position:0%
not part of that number
 
00:42:56.700 --> 00:42:58.790 align:start position:0%
not part of that number
yes

00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:43:03.290 --> 00:43:03.300 align:start position:0%
I object on two grounds excuse me
 
00:43:05.569 --> 00:43:05.579 align:start position:0%
the parents could easily have filled out
 
00:43:07.730 --> 00:43:07.740 align:start position:0%
the paperwork for the free and reduced
 
00:43:10.130 --> 00:43:10.140 align:start position:0%
that's their choice some of them don't
 
00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:12.119 align:start position:0%
want to do it for whatever reason
 
00:43:14.809 --> 00:43:14.819 align:start position:0%
the second thing is this is used as a
 
00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
measure of poverty
 
00:43:19.430 --> 00:43:19.440 align:start position:0%
so more money goes to a school to spend
 
00:43:22.970 --> 00:43:22.980 align:start position:0%
to help the children in poverty not to
 
00:43:25.250 --> 00:43:25.260 align:start position:0%
feed them to help them
 
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:28.380 align:start position:0%
and so I have often said that the
 
00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:30.180 align:start position:0%
department of Ed should set up a program
 
00:43:32.750 --> 00:43:32.760 align:start position:0%
specifically for those children in
 
00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
poverty to have either after school
 
00:43:36.950 --> 00:43:36.960 align:start position:0%
homework help or something that they're
 
00:43:40.069 --> 00:43:40.079 align:start position:0%
not getting at home that we could
 
00:43:42.349 --> 00:43:42.359 align:start position:0%
certify in the Department of Education
 
00:43:44.630 --> 00:43:44.640 align:start position:0%
ought to certify that a school district
 
00:43:47.930 --> 00:43:47.940 align:start position:0%
is doing something separately for the
 
00:43:49.490 --> 00:43:49.500 align:start position:0%
students that are in free and reduced
 
00:43:52.790 --> 00:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
meal not just throw the money and even
 
00:43:54.349 --> 00:43:54.359 align:start position:0%
the schools like and think in Manchester
 
00:43:55.730 --> 00:43:55.740 align:start position:0%
there were five
 
00:43:59.270 --> 00:43:59.280 align:start position:0%
five elementary schools one of them had
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
High far higher percentage of free and
 
00:44:03.650 --> 00:44:03.660 align:start position:0%
reduced than the others but they didn't
 
00:44:05.750 --> 00:44:05.760 align:start position:0%
get the extra money it just went through
 
00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:08.400 align:start position:0%
the whole system that didn't help that
 
00:44:10.790 --> 00:44:10.800 align:start position:0%
if this money is to be targeted for
 
00:44:13.550 --> 00:44:13.560 align:start position:0%
poverty I want to see a program through
 
00:44:16.010 --> 00:44:16.020 align:start position:0%
the department of Ed to help the
 
00:44:17.870 --> 00:44:17.880 align:start position:0%
children in poverty to learn better
 
00:44:19.309 --> 00:44:19.319 align:start position:0%
because those are the ones that don't
 
00:44:21.290 --> 00:44:21.300 align:start position:0%
take books home don't do their homework
 
00:44:24.349 --> 00:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
don't get any help at home so there
 
00:44:26.690 --> 00:44:26.700 align:start position:0%
needs to be a program to do to deal with
 
00:44:28.670 --> 00:44:28.680 align:start position:0%
that instead of just spending more money
 
00:44:30.770 --> 00:44:30.780 align:start position:0%
and not even being able to have it
 
00:44:32.450 --> 00:44:32.460 align:start position:0%
accountable that's what I've always
 
00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800 align:start position:0%
objected to in this whole thing every
 
00:44:36.710 --> 00:44:36.720 align:start position:0%
other program English as a second
 
00:44:38.569 --> 00:44:38.579 align:start position:0%
language here's the money here's the
 
00:44:40.370 --> 00:44:40.380 align:start position:0%
hours you have to spend and so on and so
 
00:44:42.589 --> 00:44:42.599 align:start position:0%
forth there's no accountability for this
 
00:44:44.809 --> 00:44:44.819 align:start position:0%
money I don't like that spending money
 
00:44:47.870 --> 00:44:47.880 align:start position:0%
with no accountability thank you
 
00:44:50.750 --> 00:44:50.760 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:44:52.790 --> 00:44:52.800 align:start position:0%
I don't even know what to say to that
 
00:44:54.770 --> 00:44:54.780 align:start position:0%
um respectfully
 
00:44:57.109 --> 00:44:57.119 align:start position:0%
the schools in Manchester
 
00:45:00.109 --> 00:45:00.119 align:start position:0%
do identify students who offering
 
00:45:03.109 --> 00:45:03.119 align:start position:0%
reduced lunch and they do provide the
 
00:45:05.089 --> 00:45:05.099 align:start position:0%
title one program their special
 
00:45:07.069 --> 00:45:07.079 align:start position:0%
programming their special reading
 
00:45:08.809 --> 00:45:08.819 align:start position:0%
programs there are any number of
 
00:45:11.210 --> 00:45:11.220 align:start position:0%
specialized programs for those children
 
00:45:13.730 --> 00:45:13.740 align:start position:0%
who are not acceding to the proficient
 
00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:17.460 align:start position:0%
levels so I beg to differ Mr chair that
 
00:45:20.210 --> 00:45:20.220 align:start position:0%
that in fact they are doing and
 
00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:24.480 align:start position:0%
it is our responsibility as a state to
 
00:45:24.480 --> 00:45:26.510 align:start position:0%
it is our responsibility as a state to
identify

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:26.520 align:start position:0%
identify
 
00:45:30.050 --> 00:45:30.060 align:start position:0%
free and reduce students in our state
 
00:45:32.569 --> 00:45:32.579 align:start position:0%
I realize it's complicated because now
 
00:45:35.089 --> 00:45:35.099 align:start position:0%
the change in the formula but I still
 
00:45:37.790 --> 00:45:37.800 align:start position:0%
think we need to have accurate numbers
 
00:45:41.390 --> 00:45:41.400 align:start position:0%
of children living in poverty ultimately
 
00:45:43.490 --> 00:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
there will be more federal dollars
 
00:45:45.730 --> 00:45:45.740 align:start position:0%
coming if we increase those numbers
 
00:45:49.490 --> 00:45:49.500 align:start position:0%
we'll have more opportunities to apply
 
00:45:51.530 --> 00:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
for more federal grants because we will
 
00:45:54.609 --> 00:45:54.619 align:start position:0%
have more accurate information there are
 
00:45:56.990 --> 00:45:57.000 align:start position:0%
innumerable reasons why we should move
 
00:45:58.970 --> 00:45:58.980 align:start position:0%
forward with this I just think it's a
 
00:46:02.089 --> 00:46:02.099 align:start position:0%
huge mistake not to be able to have the
 
00:46:06.290 --> 00:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
most accurate data to send
 
00:46:08.809 --> 00:46:08.819 align:start position:0%
our adequacy funds to our school
 
00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:13.560 align:start position:0%
districts right now again I realize that
 
00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:15.720 align:start position:0%
it is an option for parents that can
 
00:46:17.329 --> 00:46:17.339 align:start position:0%
choose or not choose
 
00:46:20.150 --> 00:46:20.160 align:start position:0%
but we need to know how many children
 
00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:22.440 align:start position:0%
really are out there
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
it's not the children's fault that their
 
00:46:26.690 --> 00:46:26.700 align:start position:0%
parents choose not to fill out those
 
00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:27.829 align:start position:0%
parents choose not to fill out those
forms

00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
forms
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
it's the children who go hungry and kids
 
00:46:33.349 --> 00:46:33.359 align:start position:0%
can't learn if they haven't eaten I just
 
00:46:35.710 --> 00:46:35.720 align:start position:0%
think we're being negligent by not
 
00:46:39.349 --> 00:46:39.359 align:start position:0%
investing in a program that will help
 
00:46:41.630 --> 00:46:41.640 align:start position:0%
number one to feed our children and
 
00:46:43.970 --> 00:46:43.980 align:start position:0%
number two will give us better a better
 
00:46:46.309 --> 00:46:46.319 align:start position:0%
count of the children that are in
 
00:46:47.750 --> 00:46:47.760 align:start position:0%
poverty in the state of New Hampshire
 
00:46:49.670 --> 00:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:46:52.849 --> 00:46:52.859 align:start position:0%
good thank you Mr chairman and regarding
 
00:46:55.190 --> 00:46:55.200 align:start position:0%
the applications there's there's a
 
00:46:57.349 --> 00:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
myriad of reasons why families don't
 
00:46:58.790 --> 00:46:58.800 align:start position:0%
build the application sometimes they
 
00:46:59.990 --> 00:47:00.000 align:start position:0%
don't feel comfortable providing
 
00:47:01.490 --> 00:47:01.500 align:start position:0%
information to the government even
 
00:47:02.690 --> 00:47:02.700 align:start position:0%
though we know that there's a lot of
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
privacy laws some families just will
 
00:47:06.349 --> 00:47:06.359 align:start position:0%
never feel comfortable doing that
 
00:47:07.670 --> 00:47:07.680 align:start position:0%
sometimes that has to do with the fact
 
00:47:09.770 --> 00:47:09.780 align:start position:0%
that a family provides their students
 
00:47:13.190 --> 00:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
with cold cold lunch from home and they
 
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:14.760 align:start position:0%
don't feel it's necessary to fill out
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
the form But ultimately
 
00:47:18.890 --> 00:47:18.900 align:start position:0%
the community is the one that suffers
 
00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:20.520 align:start position:0%
because it's less you're not actually
 
00:47:23.150 --> 00:47:23.160 align:start position:0%
getting a proper measure as Rapides said
 
00:47:25.430 --> 00:47:25.440 align:start position:0%
of how many students fall into these
 
00:47:26.569 --> 00:47:26.579 align:start position:0%
categories and those students
 
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
disproportionately need special services
 
00:47:30.470 --> 00:47:30.480 align:start position:0%
that the school districts are mandated
 
00:47:33.109 --> 00:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
by the feds in the state to provide so
 
00:47:35.030 --> 00:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
you know if you look at this outside of
 
00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:36.420 align:start position:0%
just the fact that we're certifying
 
00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:38.640 align:start position:0%
students to be fed a free school meal or
 
00:47:40.730 --> 00:47:40.740 align:start position:0%
reduced price meal there's also the
 
00:47:43.430 --> 00:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
reality that there's there's lots of
 
00:47:45.890 --> 00:47:45.900 align:start position:0%
money that school districts based on how
 
00:47:47.690 --> 00:47:47.700 align:start position:0%
the adequacy formula is written should
 
00:47:49.670 --> 00:47:49.680 align:start position:0%
be getting but because the forms not
 
00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:52.500 align:start position:0%
getting filled out for a vast number of
 
00:47:54.890 --> 00:47:54.900 align:start position:0%
reasons the property taxpayers end up
 
00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:56.520 align:start position:0%
putting the bill for a number of special
 
00:47:58.730 --> 00:47:58.740 align:start position:0%
services that are mandated that must be
 
00:48:00.109 --> 00:48:00.119 align:start position:0%
provided by the school district so
 
00:48:01.730 --> 00:48:01.740 align:start position:0%
that's kind of why when I started I said
 
00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:03.420 align:start position:0%
this is more than just a bill about
 
00:48:05.870 --> 00:48:05.880 align:start position:0%
feeding students it's also a school
 
00:48:07.910 --> 00:48:07.920 align:start position:0%
funding bill and a bill about whether or
 
00:48:10.130 --> 00:48:10.140 align:start position:0%
not the property taxpayers are actually
 
00:48:11.870 --> 00:48:11.880 align:start position:0%
that that the state is treating them
 
00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:13.500 align:start position:0%
justly and ensuring that every student
 
00:48:15.290 --> 00:48:15.300 align:start position:0%
that should be accounted for in the
 
00:48:17.630 --> 00:48:17.640 align:start position:0%
education funding formula actually is
 
00:48:21.050 --> 00:48:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:23.030 --> 00:48:23.040 align:start position:0%
thank you and this is just a general
 
00:48:26.990 --> 00:48:27.000 align:start position:0%
comment not a question it's um
 
00:48:28.790 --> 00:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
it's a complicated topic right to
 
00:48:30.890 --> 00:48:30.900 align:start position:0%
education funding God knows we spend so
 
00:48:33.109 --> 00:48:33.119 align:start position:0%
much time going over it and digging into
 
00:48:35.510 --> 00:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
huge amounts of detail just want to stay
 
00:48:38.930 --> 00:48:38.940 align:start position:0%
that I'm really uncomfortable regardless
 
00:48:40.750 --> 00:48:40.760 align:start position:0%
of how well intended the bill is
 
00:48:43.130 --> 00:48:43.140 align:start position:0%
approving basically a unilateral change
 
00:48:44.630 --> 00:48:44.640 align:start position:0%
in a budget that took so much
 
00:48:46.910 --> 00:48:46.920 align:start position:0%
negotiation work to pass this would
 
00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:47.930 align:start position:0%
negotiation work to pass this would
really

00:48:47.930 --> 00:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
really
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
be something that I could only consider
 
00:48:52.190 --> 00:48:52.200 align:start position:0%
as part of an overall budget process
 
00:48:55.010 --> 00:48:55.020 align:start position:0%
because this I can tell you right now
 
00:48:57.050 --> 00:48:57.060 align:start position:0%
that if this would have been part of the
 
00:48:58.609 --> 00:48:58.619 align:start position:0%
budget money would have been taken out
 
00:49:00.890 --> 00:49:00.900 align:start position:0%
from somewhere else and I don't think
 
00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:03.300 align:start position:0%
that it's responsible physically right
 
00:49:05.150 --> 00:49:05.160 align:start position:0%
now regardless of how it well intended
 
00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:08.339 align:start position:0%
how you know we are to now after the
 
00:49:11.569 --> 00:49:11.579 align:start position:0%
budget was approved and passed to come
 
00:49:13.430 --> 00:49:13.440 align:start position:0%
and change something in such a complex
 
00:49:15.650 --> 00:49:15.660 align:start position:0%
formula I'm looking forward to
 
00:49:18.109 --> 00:49:18.119 align:start position:0%
discussing this again you know in one
 
00:49:20.569 --> 00:49:20.579 align:start position:0%
year plus when the news session starts
 
00:49:22.730 --> 00:49:22.740 align:start position:0%
and we have a brand new budget but I
 
00:49:24.589 --> 00:49:24.599 align:start position:0%
would only consider supporting the
 
00:49:26.510 --> 00:49:26.520 align:start position:0%
legislation that would so drastically
 
00:49:29.030 --> 00:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
affect the education formula as part of
 
00:49:30.589 --> 00:49:30.599 align:start position:0%
an overall budget process where
 
00:49:32.750 --> 00:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
everything is considered
 
00:49:35.150 --> 00:49:35.160 align:start position:0%
um thank you I I definitely
 
00:49:37.730 --> 00:49:37.740 align:start position:0%
if I may Mr chairman I definitely I can
 
00:49:39.290 --> 00:49:39.300 align:start position:0%
understand that sentiment you know it's
 
00:49:41.270 --> 00:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
we're not talking hundreds of thousands
 
00:49:43.609 --> 00:49:43.619 align:start position:0%
we're talking tens of millions so I can
 
00:49:45.770 --> 00:49:45.780 align:start position:0%
understand that but um there there are
 
00:49:47.809 --> 00:49:47.819 align:start position:0%
ways to to move this bill forward where
 
00:49:49.849 --> 00:49:49.859 align:start position:0%
we can help learn more about how this
 
00:49:51.890 --> 00:49:51.900 align:start position:0%
program operates in this state and how
 
00:49:53.510 --> 00:49:53.520 align:start position:0%
many students that we are missing by
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
making it a more limited program using
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
different metrics and data to measure
 
00:49:59.329 --> 00:49:59.339 align:start position:0%
What towns um would participate in such
 
00:50:01.250 --> 00:50:01.260 align:start position:0%
a program to get an idea of how many
 
00:50:03.829 --> 00:50:03.839 align:start position:0%
students are we missing and how accurate
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
are whether it's estimates from
 
00:50:07.370 --> 00:50:07.380 align:start position:0%
organizations like number New Hampshire
 
00:50:10.790 --> 00:50:10.800 align:start position:0%
hunger Solutions or from doe to get a
 
00:50:12.530 --> 00:50:12.540 align:start position:0%
better idea so there are ways to move
 
00:50:12.540 --> 00:50:13.730 align:start position:0%
better idea so there are ways to move
forward

00:50:13.730 --> 00:50:13.740 align:start position:0%
forward
 
00:50:15.170 --> 00:50:15.180 align:start position:0%
um if the committee so chose that they
 
00:50:16.130 --> 00:50:16.140 align:start position:0%
don't want to move forward with the bill
 
00:50:17.870 --> 00:50:17.880 align:start position:0%
in its current iteration we're more than
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
happy to work with anyone on the
 
00:50:21.290 --> 00:50:21.300 align:start position:0%
committee and with doe to help make
 
00:50:23.390 --> 00:50:23.400 align:start position:0%
language that would be palatable that we
 
00:50:24.890 --> 00:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
could get you know to help us learn and
 
00:50:26.870 --> 00:50:26.880 align:start position:0%
understand better about how this program
 
00:50:28.670 --> 00:50:28.680 align:start position:0%
would affect New Hampshire school
 
00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:31.680 align:start position:0%
districts and communities and students
 
00:50:33.950 --> 00:50:33.960 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr cheer thank you um Mickey
 
00:50:37.309 --> 00:50:37.319 align:start position:0%
is it possible just to pass
 
00:50:37.319 --> 00:50:38.450 align:start position:0%
is it possible just to pass
the

00:50:38.450 --> 00:50:38.460 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:41.940 align:start position:0%
um Medicaid certification
 
00:50:44.450 --> 00:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
um to the Department of Ed so they begin
 
00:50:45.890 --> 00:50:45.900 align:start position:0%
the process
 
00:50:48.770 --> 00:50:48.780 align:start position:0%
my understanding this would not
 
00:50:52.510 --> 00:50:52.520 align:start position:0%
impact this budget it would be
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
2026 before we even had the data that we
 
00:51:00.349 --> 00:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
could use to um influence uh adequacy
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
budget so what I'm looking for is just
 
00:51:07.609 --> 00:51:07.619 align:start position:0%
having the data made available so in
 
00:51:10.430 --> 00:51:10.440 align:start position:0%
fact we know how many free and reduced
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
lunch students we have in the state by
 
00:51:14.870 --> 00:51:14.880 align:start position:0%
doing the Medicaid direct certification
 
00:51:17.390 --> 00:51:17.400 align:start position:0%
because the process is going to they
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%
have to apply they have to conduct the
 
00:51:22.370 --> 00:51:22.380 align:start position:0%
work with health and human services so
 
00:51:24.230 --> 00:51:24.240 align:start position:0%
that in and of itself is going to take
 
00:51:26.809 --> 00:51:26.819 align:start position:0%
probably another couple of years
 
00:51:26.819 --> 00:51:28.010 align:start position:0%
probably another couple of years
but

00:51:28.010 --> 00:51:28.020 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:51:30.770 --> 00:51:30.780 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm not sure I would defer to
 
00:51:32.690 --> 00:51:32.700 align:start position:0%
hunger Solutions in the department I
 
00:51:34.970 --> 00:51:34.980 align:start position:0%
think once we apply I think we're in I
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
don't think we can apply Harvest
 
00:51:38.809 --> 00:51:38.819 align:start position:0%
information and decide we don't want to
 
00:51:41.089 --> 00:51:41.099 align:start position:0%
do it later I don't know if that's true
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
that was my understanding
 
00:51:45.230 --> 00:51:45.240 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know if there is a way to
 
00:51:50.930 --> 00:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.730 --> 00:51:52.740 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Brian Eaton with
 
00:51:53.990 --> 00:51:54.000 align:start position:0%
Department of Education Bureau School
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
Finance so that is correct you mentioned
 
00:51:58.670 --> 00:51:58.680 align:start position:0%
representative Heath that there is a lag
 
00:52:00.770 --> 00:52:00.780 align:start position:0%
time so that is very that's something we
 
00:52:01.730 --> 00:52:01.740 align:start position:0%
brought up during the process I don't
 
00:52:03.829 --> 00:52:03.839 align:start position:0%
remember who we talked about it with but
 
00:52:04.910 --> 00:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
that is something to take into
 
00:52:07.250 --> 00:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
consideration that I've been why it was
 
00:52:09.890 --> 00:52:09.900 align:start position:0%
repealed why it was denied
 
00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:10.670 align:start position:0%
repealed why it was denied
um

00:52:10.670 --> 00:52:10.680 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:13.260 align:start position:0%
because the impact was unknown I don't
 
00:52:14.809 --> 00:52:14.819 align:start position:0%
know enough about the program to know if
 
00:52:17.450 --> 00:52:17.460 align:start position:0%
we can enroll in the program and then
 
00:52:20.210 --> 00:52:20.220 align:start position:0%
determine how many of our fnr students
 
00:52:22.130 --> 00:52:22.140 align:start position:0%
are part of that Medicaid director I
 
00:52:23.870 --> 00:52:23.880 align:start position:0%
don't know that we can follow up if
 
00:52:26.390 --> 00:52:26.400 align:start position:0%
you'd like but that is something that if
 
00:52:27.710 --> 00:52:27.720 align:start position:0%
it's possible we would definitely
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
potentially be interested in doing uh we
 
00:52:31.370 --> 00:52:31.380 align:start position:0%
might have the bandwidth and on the back
 
00:52:33.530 --> 00:52:33.540 align:start position:0%
end to make that differentiated Aid
 
00:52:37.010 --> 00:52:37.020 align:start position:0%
almost within fnr to know of that F R
 
00:52:39.170 --> 00:52:39.180 align:start position:0%
Who belongs to what group and what that
 
00:52:42.770 --> 00:52:42.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:44.700 align:start position:0%
I do have a question
 
00:52:46.910 --> 00:52:46.920 align:start position:0%
um I'm a freshman so I really don't know
 
00:52:49.250 --> 00:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
the answer to this the suggestion from
 
00:52:52.010 --> 00:52:52.020 align:start position:0%
Mr deschase earlier was uh you know we
 
00:52:53.990 --> 00:52:54.000 align:start position:0%
could gather data or have a small pilot
 
00:52:55.609 --> 00:52:55.619 align:start position:0%
or whatnot wouldn't that be a bill
 
00:52:57.770 --> 00:52:57.780 align:start position:0%
that's sufficiently different from this
 
00:52:59.510 --> 00:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
that it could just be introduced this
 
00:53:01.250 --> 00:53:01.260 align:start position:0%
week as a standalone Bill and discuss
 
00:53:04.609 --> 00:53:04.619 align:start position:0%
this session because I don't I I would
 
00:53:07.670 --> 00:53:07.680 align:start position:0%
really not feel comfortable trying to
 
00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:08.940 align:start position:0%
amend this based on a general
 
00:53:10.549 --> 00:53:10.559 align:start position:0%
conversation and agreed to that
 
00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:14.700 align:start position:0%
amendment I mean we that type of Bill to
 
00:53:17.329 --> 00:53:17.339 align:start position:0%
me would be a new bill wouldn't be you
 
00:53:20.329 --> 00:53:20.339 align:start position:0%
know part of this and the filing period
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.049 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:53:26.049 --> 00:53:26.059 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:53:29.329 --> 00:53:29.339 align:start position:0%
we've sent 501 forward to this Senate a
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
601 forward to the Senate they have made
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
it a study committee
 
00:53:36.530 --> 00:53:36.540 align:start position:0%
they have dealt with it in their books
 
00:53:38.870 --> 00:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
if we do anything else with 601 they're
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
going to kill it because they've gonna
 
00:53:41.809 --> 00:53:41.819 align:start position:0%
wait to find out what their study
 
00:53:44.150 --> 00:53:44.160 align:start position:0%
committee does so it's not going to go
 
00:53:46.670 --> 00:53:46.680 align:start position:0%
anywhere in the Senate
 
00:53:48.770 --> 00:53:48.780 align:start position:0%
House Bill 2 did and I'm sorry a house
 
00:53:50.930 --> 00:53:50.940 align:start position:0%
bill to when the Senate did pull this
 
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:52.740 align:start position:0%
language they did replace it with a
 
00:53:54.890 --> 00:53:54.900 align:start position:0%
study committee for
 
00:53:57.470 --> 00:53:57.480 align:start position:0%
um studying the free and reduced lunch
 
00:53:59.690 --> 00:53:59.700 align:start position:0%
meal and how it impacts state aid
 
00:54:02.089 --> 00:54:02.099 align:start position:0%
programs that committee's report is due
 
00:54:06.530 --> 00:54:06.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:06.540 --> 00:54:10.250 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:54:10.250 --> 00:54:10.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:12.170 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:54:12.170 --> 00:54:12.180 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:54:15.230 --> 00:54:15.240 align:start position:0%
the chair can I just ask Mickey may know
 
00:54:17.870 --> 00:54:17.880 align:start position:0%
or perhaps department of educational is
 
00:54:19.069 --> 00:54:19.079 align:start position:0%
there a way to continue this
 
00:54:19.079 --> 00:54:20.210 align:start position:0%
there a way to continue this
conversation

00:54:20.210 --> 00:54:20.220 align:start position:0%
conversation
 
00:54:22.849 --> 00:54:22.859 align:start position:0%
um further into the fall I fully support
 
00:54:25.250 --> 00:54:25.260 align:start position:0%
the concept I mean it's who wouldn't
 
00:54:27.410 --> 00:54:27.420 align:start position:0%
support the concept
 
00:54:29.390 --> 00:54:29.400 align:start position:0%
um however there are so many unknowns
 
00:54:31.549 --> 00:54:31.559 align:start position:0%
around the money that I really feel a
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
little uncomfortable uh going forward
 
00:54:35.690 --> 00:54:35.700 align:start position:0%
full since it's clear that there are
 
00:54:36.950 --> 00:54:36.960 align:start position:0%
going to be consequences and I think we
 
00:54:38.089 --> 00:54:38.099 align:start position:0%
should have a better understanding of
 
00:54:39.650 --> 00:54:39.660 align:start position:0%
what they are but I don't want this
 
00:54:42.349 --> 00:54:42.359 align:start position:0%
conversation to end so is there a way to
 
00:54:44.930 --> 00:54:44.940 align:start position:0%
move this forward
 
00:54:47.510 --> 00:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
so Finance has until the full committee
 
00:54:49.069 --> 00:54:49.079 align:start position:0%
has to exec its retained bills I Believe
 
00:54:52.190 --> 00:54:52.200 align:start position:0%
by November 17th so that's when this
 
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
bill 601 needs to be exact
 
00:54:56.630 --> 00:54:56.640 align:start position:0%
um the study committee as I mentioned
 
00:54:58.430 --> 00:54:58.440 align:start position:0%
will be doing its work from now until 1
 
00:55:01.549 --> 00:55:01.559 align:start position:0%
November uh so those are I guess the two
 
00:55:04.130 --> 00:55:04.140 align:start position:0%
Avenues in on this topic
 
00:55:05.870 --> 00:55:05.880 align:start position:0%
um so their recommendations would be up
 
00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:08.099 align:start position:0%
before we have to vote
 
00:55:11.089 --> 00:55:11.099 align:start position:0%
uh yeah yes
 
00:55:13.130 --> 00:55:13.140 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair can we hold off on this
 
00:55:16.670 --> 00:55:16.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:19.250 --> 00:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
and it is just to clarify it's a it's a
 
00:55:20.690 --> 00:55:20.700 align:start position:0%
House and Senate study committee it's
 
00:55:22.069 --> 00:55:22.079 align:start position:0%
not just a senate study committee they
 
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
put it in-house Bill too but
 
00:55:26.990 --> 00:55:27.000 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure if appointments have
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
been made yet or if they've met but I
 
00:55:31.549 --> 00:55:31.559 align:start position:0%
know yeah I don't think they have so but
 
00:55:33.890 --> 00:55:33.900 align:start position:0%
I know they have a report date by one uh
 
00:55:36.170 --> 00:55:36.180 align:start position:0%
one November
 
00:55:38.210 --> 00:55:38.220 align:start position:0%
so the the
 
00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:41.280 align:start position:0%
we continue to retain it yeah so no
 
00:55:44.569 --> 00:55:44.579 align:start position:0%
action yes I guess okay so what what the
 
00:55:46.130 --> 00:55:46.140 align:start position:0%
what division two would have to do at
 
00:55:48.049 --> 00:55:48.059 align:start position:0%
that point is just have a future work
 
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
session on this build prior to the full
 
00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:53.220 align:start position:0%
committee on so sometime between in
 
00:55:54.770 --> 00:55:54.780 align:start position:0%
assuming that committee reports by one
 
00:55:57.710 --> 00:55:57.720 align:start position:0%
November between one November and uh 17
 
00:56:00.829 --> 00:56:00.839 align:start position:0%
November so we're putting it on the bus
 
00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
okay so so the motion
 
00:56:06.890 --> 00:56:06.900 align:start position:0%
there is no motion
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
you have no motion okay all right
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:56:14.089 --> 00:56:14.099 align:start position:0%
dodged a bullet on that one
 
00:56:15.710 --> 00:56:15.720 align:start position:0%
yeah for now
 
00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:18.960 align:start position:0%
uh 620 establishing a division of early
 
00:56:20.690 --> 00:56:20.700 align:start position:0%
learning in the Department of Education
 
00:56:22.849 --> 00:56:22.859 align:start position:0%
relative to pre-kindergarten pilot
 
00:56:22.859 --> 00:56:27.230 align:start position:0%
relative to pre-kindergarten pilot
program

00:56:27.230 --> 00:56:27.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:28.670 --> 00:56:28.680 align:start position:0%
I thought
 
00:56:32.210 --> 00:56:32.220 align:start position:0%
could be we put we did this we retained
 
00:56:32.220 --> 00:56:33.650 align:start position:0%
could be we put we did this we retained
it

00:56:33.650 --> 00:56:33.660 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:56:35.150 --> 00:56:35.160 align:start position:0%
we didn't do anything with it we didn't
 
00:56:37.430 --> 00:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
do anything with it
 
00:56:40.370 --> 00:56:40.380 align:start position:0%
and it is not in the budget but it's one
 
00:56:49.309 --> 00:56:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:51.950 --> 00:56:51.960 align:start position:0%
so Mr chair yes maybe we have more
 
00:56:53.690 --> 00:56:53.700 align:start position:0%
information so there was no fiscal note
 
00:56:56.450 --> 00:56:56.460 align:start position:0%
but we've been sort of promised a fiscal
 
00:56:58.309 --> 00:56:58.319 align:start position:0%
no do we have any further information on
 
00:56:59.990 --> 00:57:00.000 align:start position:0%
what it would cost
 
00:57:05.809 --> 00:57:05.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:08.750 --> 00:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
the bill is also in the Senate and I'm
 
00:57:11.270 --> 00:57:11.280 align:start position:0%
not sure what the action was in the
 
00:57:11.280 --> 00:57:12.650 align:start position:0%
not sure what the action was in the
Senate

00:57:12.650 --> 00:57:12.660 align:start position:0%
Senate
 
00:57:15.049 --> 00:57:15.059 align:start position:0%
I know it was retained in the Senate but
 
00:57:16.670 --> 00:57:16.680 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there was any action
 
00:57:18.290 --> 00:57:18.300 align:start position:0%
within the budget
 
00:57:20.450 --> 00:57:20.460 align:start position:0%
my understanding is the Department of
 
00:57:24.710 --> 00:57:24.720 align:start position:0%
Education has launched some sort of an
 
00:57:24.720 --> 00:57:26.329 align:start position:0%
Education has launched some sort of an
effort

00:57:26.329 --> 00:57:26.339 align:start position:0%
effort
 
00:57:29.809 --> 00:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
um relative to a like program is what we
 
00:57:32.750 --> 00:57:32.760 align:start position:0%
had described in the pilot but in this
 
00:57:35.630 --> 00:57:35.640 align:start position:0%
in 620 but I don't know anything further
 
00:57:37.130 --> 00:57:37.140 align:start position:0%
than that
 
00:57:37.140 --> 00:57:38.390 align:start position:0%
than that
yes

00:57:38.390 --> 00:57:38.400 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:40.500 align:start position:0%
a structure under the circumstances
 
00:57:42.170 --> 00:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
since we already are going to have a
 
00:57:44.329 --> 00:57:44.339 align:start position:0%
work session later to deal with the bill
 
00:57:46.970 --> 00:57:46.980 align:start position:0%
we just took no action for since we seem
 
00:57:48.470 --> 00:57:48.480 align:start position:0%
to still be waiting for information
 
00:57:51.530 --> 00:57:51.540 align:start position:0%
should this also be a no action and wait
 
00:57:53.390 --> 00:57:53.400 align:start position:0%
for more data and pursue that
 
00:57:55.250 --> 00:57:55.260 align:start position:0%
information to make sure we can make an
 
00:57:56.390 --> 00:57:56.400 align:start position:0%
informative is that the general
 
00:57:58.609 --> 00:57:58.619 align:start position:0%
consensus we're going to meet again well
 
00:57:59.690 --> 00:57:59.700 align:start position:0%
let's see if we can get some more
 
00:58:01.730 --> 00:58:01.740 align:start position:0%
information if I may have I'll check
 
00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:03.780 align:start position:0%
with Senator Whitley and see where the
 
00:58:05.569 --> 00:58:05.579 align:start position:0%
bill is in the Senate and see what
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
they're doing and I'll come back with
 
00:58:09.109 --> 00:58:09.119 align:start position:0%
more information thank you so that bill
 
00:58:11.030 --> 00:58:11.040 align:start position:0%
is in Senate education re-referred so
 
00:58:13.010 --> 00:58:13.020 align:start position:0%
they are working on that as well and I
 
00:58:15.049 --> 00:58:15.059 align:start position:0%
will point out I think we've had
 
00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:16.980 align:start position:0%
this bill waiting on information since
 
00:58:19.670 --> 00:58:19.680 align:start position:0%
the winter so I'm not sure what we're
 
00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
gonna what we're going to see correct
 
00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:24.370 align:start position:0%
gonna what we're going to see correct
okay

00:58:24.370 --> 00:58:24.380 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:58:27.349 --> 00:58:27.359 align:start position:0%
638 relative to the extraordinary needs
 
00:58:29.329 --> 00:58:29.339 align:start position:0%
Grant to schools
 
00:58:32.650 --> 00:58:32.660 align:start position:0%

00:58:36.530 --> 00:58:36.540 align:start position:0%
itl by Joe second by Mary follow us in
 
00:58:36.540 --> 00:58:42.650 align:start position:0%

00:58:46.430 --> 00:58:46.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:49.010 --> 00:58:49.020 align:start position:0%
so we will be meeting sometime after the
 
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
