representative deimon while an esteemed
 
00:19:08.789 --> 00:19:08.799 align:start position:0%
colleague be taken off this list since

would
 
00:19:22.029 --> 00:19:22.039 align:start position:0%
suggest that at least some of the second
 
00:19:24.990 --> 00:19:25.000 align:start position:0%
page looks to me like it was in the
 
00:19:29.110 --> 00:19:29.120 align:start position:0%
speaker's setting up of this m uh could
 
00:19:31.510 --> 00:19:31.520 align:start position:0%
that be flagged
 
00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.149 align:start position:0%
that be flagged
accordingly

00:19:33.149 --> 00:19:33.159 align:start position:0%
accordingly
 
00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:37.760 align:start position:0%
just does say charge speak okay charge
 
00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:39.600 align:start position:0%
and study
 
00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.190 align:start position:0%
and study
purpose

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
purpose
 
00:19:45.590 --> 00:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
um I just like specifically the Speaker
 
00:19:48.350 --> 00:19:48.360 align:start position:0%
of The house's name there so people will

know the front page is me and now
 
00:19:53.789 --> 00:19:53.799 align:start position:0%
suddenly we're on the second page and I
 
00:19:55.430 --> 00:19:55.440 align:start position:0%
think there should be an acknowledgement
 
00:19:58.950 --> 00:19:58.960 align:start position:0%
this is his charge to us would it be
 
00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:01.120 align:start position:0%
like an according to well I think it'
 
00:20:03.029 --> 00:20:03.039 align:start position:0%
just be speaker Packards charge and
 
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:05.640 align:start position:0%

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:19.240 align:start position:0%
end I don't have the document study
 
00:20:21.789 --> 00:20:21.799 align:start position:0%
purpose right okay then you have next
 
00:20:24.870 --> 00:20:24.880 align:start position:0%
paragraph or next section process and
 
00:20:28.789 --> 00:20:28.799 align:start position:0%
procedures okay yeah yeah got it any
 
00:20:32.029 --> 00:20:32.039 align:start position:0%
other changes we might want to suggest
 
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:37.510 --> 00:20:37.520 align:start position:0%
two looks
 
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:39.720 align:start position:0%
good page
 
00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:42.750 align:start position:0%
good page
three

00:20:42.750 --> 00:20:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:45.870 --> 00:20:45.880 align:start position:0%
anyone um I have a few things on page
 
00:20:49.590 --> 00:20:49.600 align:start position:0%
three so um this first part let's gang
 
00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:51.200 align:start position:0%
up together against problems and not
 
00:20:53.070 --> 00:20:53.080 align:start position:0%
gang up against each other it's also
 
00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
repeated on page four um so which page
 
00:20:57.149 --> 00:20:57.159 align:start position:0%
do we want to leave it on because we
 
00:20:59.669 --> 00:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
don't want to say that twice on
 
00:21:02.149 --> 00:21:02.159 align:start position:0%
consecutive page what I think you did
 
00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
was you took my final note and conflated
 
00:21:08.669 --> 00:21:08.679 align:start position:0%
it into the intro which is good but that
 
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:12.440 align:start position:0%
means repetition may want to go out so
 
00:21:14.630 --> 00:21:14.640 align:start position:0%
uh where do you want the gang up quote
 
00:21:18.350 --> 00:21:18.360 align:start position:0%
to be on the top of three or the bottom
 
00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:21.149 align:start position:0%
to be on the top of three or the bottom
of

00:21:21.149 --> 00:21:21.159 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:21:24.070 --> 00:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
four I prefer it on the bottom of four
 
00:21:26.630 --> 00:21:26.640 align:start position:0%
okay so let's take it out so we'll take
 
00:21:28.549 --> 00:21:28.559 align:start position:0%
out starting at representative pearon
 
00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:30.799 align:start position:0%
and all the way uh line four on the top
 
00:21:34.950 --> 00:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
of three line four and five is out got
 
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:37.480 align:start position:0%
it and then
 
00:21:40.870 --> 00:21:40.880 align:start position:0%
um uh the next paragraph the word as
 
00:21:42.430 --> 00:21:42.440 align:start position:0%
should be stricken and evidence should
 
00:21:46.990 --> 00:21:47.000 align:start position:0%
be capitalized because it ends with a
 
00:21:49.750 --> 00:21:49.760 align:start position:0%
just that we received it but no action
 
00:21:53.149 --> 00:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
it's a separate sentence that starts the
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
action right agreed I yeah
 
00:21:59.909 --> 00:21:59.919 align:start position:0%
linguistically paragraph 2 two line two
 
00:22:03.669 --> 00:22:03.679 align:start position:0%
strike the word as capitalize e for
 
00:22:05.990 --> 00:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
evidence and then at the end of the
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
paragraph um the in addition to received
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
testimony should be stricken it just we
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
talked about receiving testimony in the
 
00:22:15.470 --> 00:22:15.480 align:start position:0%
beginning of it but it's confusing
 
00:22:17.029 --> 00:22:17.039 align:start position:0%
because it sounds as if we received
 
00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:19.120 align:start position:0%
testimony at the court which we didn't
 
00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:20.559 align:start position:0%
and I wouldn't want somebody to think
 
00:22:24.590 --> 00:22:24.600 align:start position:0%
that we had somehow received testimony
 
00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:27.120 align:start position:0%
testimon members also visit to observe
 
00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:28.520 align:start position:0%
day-to-day proceed
 
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
and proceedings and
 
00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:34.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:40.080 align:start position:0%
proced good let's keep going um on the
 
00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph that starts the plan
 
00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:46.240 align:start position:0%
um is it true that on November 9th a
 
00:22:48.789 --> 00:22:48.799 align:start position:0%
full committee work session was cons
 
00:22:51.390 --> 00:22:51.400 align:start position:0%
convened to report on the interim
 
00:22:53.710 --> 00:22:53.720 align:start position:0%
findings or is that really what we're
 
00:22:56.230 --> 00:22:56.240 align:start position:0%
doing today or is it both or
 
00:23:00.230 --> 00:23:00.240 align:start position:0%
what um what did did we do last week no
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
we did meet on the
 
00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799 align:start position:0%
N yeah we
 
00:23:08.029 --> 00:23:08.039 align:start position:0%
did every chair I did yeah I think
 
00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:11.080 align:start position:0%
that's good there okay um I do think
 
00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
though where it says additionally
 
00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:17.080 align:start position:0%
um that that sentence doesn't make a lot
 
00:23:18.870 --> 00:23:18.880 align:start position:0%
of sense it perhaps if it's said
 
00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:21.559 align:start position:0%
additionally to consider if there would
 
00:23:23.510 --> 00:23:23.520 align:start position:0%
be additional subcommittees formed would
 
00:23:25.710 --> 00:23:25.720 align:start position:0%
make more sense yeah otherwise it sounds
 
00:23:28.070 --> 00:23:28.080 align:start position:0%
like it's a question additional would
 
00:23:30.149 --> 00:23:30.159 align:start position:0%
you read your your suggested change
 
00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799 align:start position:0%
additionally to consider if there would
 
00:23:36.269 --> 00:23:36.279 align:start position:0%
would be also take out would there be
 
00:23:38.789 --> 00:23:38.799 align:start position:0%
additional sub committees so just get
 
00:23:41.470 --> 00:23:41.480 align:start position:0%
rid of the word word there and just say
 
00:23:44.549 --> 00:23:44.559 align:start position:0%
add in to consider if there okay got
 
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:47.880 align:start position:0%
that after
 
00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:51.750 align:start position:0%
that after
additionally

00:23:51.750 --> 00:23:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
additionally anything else on three um
 
00:23:57.070 --> 00:23:57.080 align:start position:0%
stakeholder should be one word in the
 
00:23:58.909 --> 00:23:58.919 align:start position:0%
next paragraph
 
00:24:04.470 --> 00:24:04.480 align:start position:0%
y yes yep and then the final paragraph
 
00:24:06.549 --> 00:24:06.559 align:start position:0%
um I think should be stricken because we
 
00:24:08.669 --> 00:24:08.679 align:start position:0%
already talked about in the middle at
 
00:24:10.750 --> 00:24:10.760 align:start position:0%
forming these four subcommittees and
 
00:24:13.870 --> 00:24:13.880 align:start position:0%
it's uh confusing to talk about forming
 
00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:16.520 align:start position:0%
the subcommittees again we just said up
 
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:19.200 align:start position:0%
here we formed them I
 
00:24:21.350 --> 00:24:21.360 align:start position:0%
ker what do you like I mean I'm really
 
00:24:24.110 --> 00:24:24.120 align:start position:0%
trying to tell everybody what a great
 
00:24:26.070 --> 00:24:26.080 align:start position:0%
job we're doing here together and you
 
00:24:29.190 --> 00:24:29.200 align:start position:0%
know short of an attached CD with the
 
00:24:32.190 --> 00:24:32.200 align:start position:0%
choir singing Kumbaya I appreciate that
 
00:24:33.789 --> 00:24:33.799 align:start position:0%
but knowing the lack of how much people
 
00:24:34.789 --> 00:24:34.799 align:start position:0%
want to
 
00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:37.960 align:start position:0%
read so so the thought is the last
 
00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:40.760 align:start position:0%
paragraph is stricken stricken from the
 
00:24:43.669 --> 00:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
record me notwithstanding yeah okay all
 
00:24:46.269 --> 00:24:46.279 align:start position:0%
right kick it out our Hope was not in
 
00:24:48.789 --> 00:24:48.799 align:start position:0%
vain I mean come on this is good 19th
 
00:24:52.590 --> 00:24:52.600 align:start position:0%
century flowery language here all right
 
00:24:56.750 --> 00:24:56.760 align:start position:0%
strike the last paragraph I'll get over
 
00:24:56.760 --> 00:24:59.789 align:start position:0%
strike the last paragraph I'll get over
it

00:24:59.789 --> 00:24:59.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:03.549 --> 00:25:03.559 align:start position:0%
and then this page four yeah so instead
 
00:25:06.669 --> 00:25:06.679 align:start position:0%
of two of them say two of the sub yes I
 
00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:09.520 align:start position:0%
get after people for doing that too and
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
then you don't need a comma after Rules
 
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:15.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
forms well we
 
00:25:20.430 --> 00:25:20.440 align:start position:0%
do two of them two of the subcommittees
 
00:25:24.350 --> 00:25:24.360 align:start position:0%
comma Rules of Evidence and see it could
 
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:26.720 align:start position:0%
sound like Rules of Evidence and forms
 
00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:29.080 align:start position:0%

yes it is indeed the and is your brain
 
00:25:33.549 --> 00:25:33.559 align:start position:0%
it's pounded into my head for two years
 
00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:35.070 align:start position:0%
it's pounded into my head for two years

00:25:38.710 --> 00:25:38.720 align:start position:0%
commas um I think the the the forms
 
00:25:41.830 --> 00:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
should have the the longer title to it
 
00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
if we're going to mention it at
 
00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:48.150 align:start position:0%

andt forms believe their formal work
 
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:24.520 align:start position:0%
because it's not the committee it's who
 
00:26:27.070 --> 00:26:27.080 align:start position:0%
believe it's the members who believe
 
00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:29.159 align:start position:0%
whether the word committee is is
 
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:32.240 align:start position:0%
substantive for the the whole it could
 
00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:34.470 align:start position:0%
substantive for the the whole it could
be

00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:26:36.950 --> 00:26:36.960 align:start position:0%

the role of Deborah D Simone is now
 
00:29:08.830 --> 00:29:08.840 align:start position:0%
being able filled by Alicia Greg and the
 
00:29:11.269 --> 00:29:11.279 align:start position:0%
role of marjerie Smith is as well in
 
00:29:13.070 --> 00:29:13.080 align:start position:0%
today's episode yes a lot of
 
00:29:16.549 --> 00:29:16.559 align:start position:0%
personalities going here I got this um
 
00:29:18.870 --> 00:29:18.880 align:start position:0%
that doesn't go in the report anything
 
00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:21.960 align:start position:0%
on page
 
00:29:26.389 --> 00:29:26.399 align:start position:0%
five there's one problem at least in
 
00:29:29.149 --> 00:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
paragraph three I refer to myself in the
 
00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:31.720 align:start position:0%
third person and in the first person in
 
00:29:34.190 --> 00:29:34.200 align:start position:0%
the same paragraph and since I sign the
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
report at the end if if I'm going to be
 
00:29:39.990 --> 00:29:40.000 align:start position:0%
um sort of L dah it should at least be
 
00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:43.080 align:start position:0%
consistent yeah just be the chairman so
 
00:29:46.870 --> 00:29:46.880 align:start position:0%
I suggest in the third
 
00:29:51.029 --> 00:29:51.039 align:start position:0%
paragraph first line um you can just get
 
00:29:53.070 --> 00:29:53.080 align:start position:0%
rid of the word I and did this four
 
00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
times just get rid of the word I and did
 
00:29:56.389 --> 00:29:56.399 align:start position:0%
that yeah you just take out I had been
 
00:30:01.190 --> 00:30:01.200 align:start position:0%
given a copy of of it is um chman person
 
00:30:02.830 --> 00:30:02.840 align:start position:0%
have been given that's fine just take
 
00:30:05.470 --> 00:30:05.480 align:start position:0%
out I yeah and did this four times and
 
00:30:07.669 --> 00:30:07.679 align:start position:0%
it then it all flows quite
 
00:30:11.350 --> 00:30:11.360 align:start position:0%
well or just add the word the chairman
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
take out okay I can't really hear much
 
00:30:16.909 --> 00:30:16.919 align:start position:0%
of anybody I'm sorry bad ears um just
 
00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:20.440 align:start position:0%
this one word if you get rid of it and
 
00:30:22.830 --> 00:30:22.840 align:start position:0%
we can take that out but I'm thinking
 
00:30:25.389 --> 00:30:25.399 align:start position:0%
that in the first line chairman Pearson
 
00:30:29.190 --> 00:30:29.200 align:start position:0%
becomes I because I signed this
 
00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:32.470 align:start position:0%
becomes I because I signed this
report

00:30:32.470 --> 00:30:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.870 --> 00:30:35.880 align:start position:0%
so do we want to do that so I I think
 
00:30:37.590 --> 00:30:37.600 align:start position:0%
you should stay stick with chairman
 
00:30:38.789 --> 00:30:38.799 align:start position:0%
Pearson because people don't want to
 
00:30:40.230 --> 00:30:40.240 align:start position:0%
read the whole thing and go okay who is
 
00:30:42.509 --> 00:30:42.519 align:start position:0%
this like that did this and go to so
 
00:30:43.590 --> 00:30:43.600 align:start position:0%
they don't have to read to the end
 
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
before should to that okay I can live
 
00:30:47.789 --> 00:30:47.799 align:start position:0%
with that fine speak in the and then
 
00:30:49.509 --> 00:30:49.519 align:start position:0%
also the word he but we're going to take
 
00:30:52.870 --> 00:30:52.880 align:start position:0%
the word I out of the end of that third
 
00:30:55.190 --> 00:30:55.200 align:start position:0%
paragraph uh sometimes even reading the
 
00:30:58.190 --> 00:30:58.200 align:start position:0%
cases referred to in the footnote not
 
00:31:01.590 --> 00:31:01.600 align:start position:0%
and this was done four times I mean
 
00:31:05.190 --> 00:31:05.200 align:start position:0%
taking the word out I out and did this
 
00:31:07.789 --> 00:31:07.799 align:start position:0%
four it is near you could add take out I
 
00:31:10.190 --> 00:31:10.200 align:start position:0%
and put the chairman and the chairman
 
00:31:16.190 --> 00:31:16.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:18.470 --> 00:31:18.480 align:start position:0%
right and I don't bring this everywhere
 
00:31:21.710 --> 00:31:21.720 align:start position:0%
I go but it just seems that way it's a
 
00:31:21.720 --> 00:31:22.669 align:start position:0%
I go but it just seems that way it's a
great

00:31:22.669 --> 00:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:26.200 align:start position:0%
book anybody anything else on that first
 
00:31:32.830 --> 00:31:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:35.950 --> 00:31:35.960 align:start position:0%
evidence um are we going to continue
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
with pagination at the bottom of the
 
00:31:42.750 --> 00:31:42.760 align:start position:0%
page we get up to okay so that's page
 
00:31:45.029 --> 00:31:45.039 align:start position:0%
five anything
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
anything page
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:58.430 align:start position:0%
anything page
seven

00:31:58.430 --> 00:31:58.440 align:start position:0%
seven
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
okay page eight which is subcommittee
 
00:32:08.029 --> 00:32:08.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
changed so the first one is uh that I
 
00:32:12.870 --> 00:32:12.880 align:start position:0%
have and there's probably more but on
 
00:32:15.669 --> 00:32:15.679 align:start position:0%
that first main paragraph uh one two
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
three fourth line down requests for
 
00:32:19.190 --> 00:32:19.200 align:start position:0%
proposals there should be an S at the
 
00:32:20.950 --> 00:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
end of proposal it says request for
 
00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:23.440 align:start position:0%
proposal it should be s i I'm sorry
 
00:32:24.789 --> 00:32:24.799 align:start position:0%
would you speak louder would you speak
 
00:32:27.590 --> 00:32:27.600 align:start position:0%
closer to the a problem that first
 
00:32:29.509 --> 00:32:29.519 align:start position:0%
paragraph We Revisited judge Susan
 
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:31.960 align:start position:0%
Ashley's testimony on the fourth line
 
00:32:34.230 --> 00:32:34.240 align:start position:0%
there's a request for of acquiring
 
00:32:36.110 --> 00:32:36.120 align:start position:0%
requests for proposal it should have an
 
00:32:37.950 --> 00:32:37.960 align:start position:0%
S it should be plural request for
 
00:32:40.549 --> 00:32:40.559 align:start position:0%
proposals requests
 
00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
plural no it's a request for multiple
 
00:32:46.909 --> 00:32:46.919 align:start position:0%
proposals so where does where do you
 
00:32:48.870 --> 00:32:48.880 align:start position:0%
after which word do you want the S
 
00:32:50.549 --> 00:32:50.559 align:start position:0%
proposals okay yeah so an S after
 
00:32:52.870 --> 00:32:52.880 align:start position:0%
proposal I also think the title should
 
00:32:55.470 --> 00:32:55.480 align:start position:0%
just be court form subcommittee and
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
strike the rest in all the quotes
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
because all the others are just like the
 
00:33:01.269 --> 00:33:01.279 align:start position:0%
name of the sub it did have a title I
 
00:33:02.909 --> 00:33:02.919 align:start position:0%
don't know where it went it was a title
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
on top of it but it was above this but
 
00:33:07.789 --> 00:33:07.799 align:start position:0%
then I just did to kind of explain it
 
00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:09.320 align:start position:0%
but yeah this is just taken straight
 
00:33:11.310 --> 00:33:11.320 align:start position:0%
from our our charge but we can take that
 
00:33:13.750 --> 00:33:13.760 align:start position:0%
out for sure but it did just have court
 
00:33:18.669 --> 00:33:18.679 align:start position:0%
forms on the email I think do we want to
 
00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:21.399 align:start position:0%
abbreviate the title to court forms yeah
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
we could do that anybody anybody yeah
 
00:33:25.950 --> 00:33:25.960 align:start position:0%
court forms and maybe capital f forms or
 
00:33:29.310 --> 00:33:29.320 align:start position:0%
not yeah yeah it should be all right now
 
00:33:33.070 --> 00:33:33.080 align:start position:0%
I would like the subcommittee chair to
 
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:37.200 align:start position:0%
be above my name okay I'm just a member
 
00:33:39.590 --> 00:33:39.600 align:start position:0%
of that group I want representative
 
00:33:42.549 --> 00:33:42.559 align:start position:0%
Alicia Greg subcommittee chair to be the
 
00:33:55.950 --> 00:33:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:57.710 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:33:57.710 --> 00:33:57.720 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:01.430 --> 00:34:01.440 align:start position:0%
that first paragraph court forms to be
 
00:34:06.430 --> 00:34:06.440 align:start position:0%
consistent we would want to have court
 
00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:08.599 align:start position:0%
capitalized as it is
 
00:34:11.389 --> 00:34:11.399 align:start position:0%
above uh such as should not be a
 
00:34:14.990 --> 00:34:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
colon did you want to add in you had
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you were going to be
 
00:34:19.790 --> 00:34:19.800 align:start position:0%
checking in with the court to make sure
 
00:34:21.790 --> 00:34:21.800 align:start position:0%
that the work was completed and all was
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
well um did you want to add something in
 
00:34:25.430 --> 00:34:25.440 align:start position:0%
here to that effect that way we're just
 
00:34:27.069 --> 00:34:27.079 align:start position:0%
noting that we don't need to meet any
 
00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:29.200 align:start position:0%
more but well so that's the part where I
 
00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:30.919 align:start position:0%
said they they agreed to keep the lines
 
00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:32.720 align:start position:0%
of communication open for future
 
00:34:34.389 --> 00:34:34.399 align:start position:0%
conversations as we hear so I kind of
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
addressed that okay all right that's
 
00:34:38.109 --> 00:34:38.119 align:start position:0%
fine that was a question I recall I
 
00:34:41.710 --> 00:34:41.720 align:start position:0%
asked uh the court people present and
 
00:34:44.069 --> 00:34:44.079 align:start position:0%
they didn't just sort of agree they were
 
00:34:47.109 --> 00:34:47.119 align:start position:0%
enthusiastic about it they wanted us to
 
00:34:50.750 --> 00:34:50.760 align:start position:0%
yeah so anything from you or from
 
00:34:52.990 --> 00:34:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative Smith's no she didn't
 
00:34:56.349 --> 00:34:56.359 align:start position:0%
have anything okay page nine judicial
 
00:34:59.710 --> 00:34:59.720 align:start position:0%
training education supervision
 
00:35:03.030 --> 00:35:03.040 align:start position:0%
accountability so we should put uh
 
00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:06.400 align:start position:0%
Smith's name first as a chair uhhuh
 
00:35:13.829 --> 00:35:13.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:17.150 --> 00:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
chair and we can I think we can take out
 
00:35:20.190 --> 00:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
in the title the words draft
 
00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
um and add the word subcommittee to make
 
00:35:31.230 --> 00:35:31.240 align:start position:0%
it consistent with everybody
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
else and I I I know the researcher will
 
00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:37.550 align:start position:0%
be doing this but get the
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:40.069 align:start position:0%
be doing this but get the
[Music]

00:35:40.069 --> 00:35:40.079 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:35:45.230 --> 00:35:45.240 align:start position:0%
um the case size of the type consistent
 
00:35:47.390 --> 00:35:47.400 align:start position:0%
throughout the
 
00:35:51.829 --> 00:35:51.839 align:start position:0%
report um and if one sub
 
00:35:54.349 --> 00:35:54.359 align:start position:0%
committee's headline is all caps they
 
00:35:57.150 --> 00:35:57.160 align:start position:0%
all should be and if it's caps and lower
 
00:35:59.309 --> 00:35:59.319 align:start position:0%
case they all should be so the reports
 
00:36:02.270 --> 00:36:02.280 align:start position:0%
look consistent to each
 
00:36:05.470 --> 00:36:05.480 align:start position:0%
other I I kind of think that this
 
00:36:08.069 --> 00:36:08.079 align:start position:0%
sentence should just add in the word all
 
00:36:10.710 --> 00:36:10.720 align:start position:0%
because otherwise okay I see what you're
 
00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:13.160 align:start position:0%
pointing to I don't think they do so
 
00:36:15.630 --> 00:36:15.640 align:start position:0%
even if a judge is familiar with the law
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
and almost no judges appointed the
 
00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:20.280 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court are I feel like it kind of
 
00:36:22.950 --> 00:36:22.960 align:start position:0%
sounds a bit on the offense but if we
 
00:36:24.670 --> 00:36:24.680 align:start position:0%
just change it to even if a judge is
 
00:36:27.950 --> 00:36:27.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with
 
00:36:31.870 --> 00:36:31.880 align:start position:0%
um the law areas of law or something
 
00:36:35.630 --> 00:36:35.640 align:start position:0%
like cuz we want to remember that the
 
00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:37.640 align:start position:0%
judges were attorneys before so we don't
 
00:36:38.710 --> 00:36:38.720 align:start position:0%
want to make it sound like they don't
 
00:36:40.790 --> 00:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
know anything about the law right it's
 
00:36:42.990 --> 00:36:43.000 align:start position:0%
the the really the concern is that
 
00:36:45.109 --> 00:36:45.119 align:start position:0%
they're not always knowing about family
 
00:36:47.309 --> 00:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
law or every area of law so we could
 
00:36:51.109 --> 00:36:51.119 align:start position:0%
just do all aspects of the law yeah and
 
00:36:53.190 --> 00:36:53.200 align:start position:0%
almost no judges appointed to the
 
00:36:55.349 --> 00:36:55.359 align:start position:0%
Circuit Court are familiar with all
 
00:36:57.230 --> 00:36:57.240 align:start position:0%
aspects of the law is that so even if a
 
00:36:59.550 --> 00:36:59.560 align:start position:0%
Jud familiar with all aspects familiar
 
00:37:01.470 --> 00:37:01.480 align:start position:0%
with all aspects of the law and then we
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
take out that next the dash and the to I
 
00:37:06.750 --> 00:37:06.760 align:start position:0%
don't mind the I don't mind it after
 
00:37:08.030 --> 00:37:08.040 align:start position:0%
that as long as we say we just have to
 
00:37:10.430 --> 00:37:10.440 align:start position:0%
keep a comma you gotta in it's not a
 
00:37:13.069 --> 00:37:13.079 align:start position:0%
comma it's a dash because you broke out
 
00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:16.160 align:start position:0%
that thought with a dash so it should
 
00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:18.680 align:start position:0%
not end with a comma but with a dash so
 
00:37:20.790 --> 00:37:20.800 align:start position:0%
yeah that's true so I'm reading that
 
00:37:24.069 --> 00:37:24.079 align:start position:0%
line two is now the law Dash and almost
 
00:37:26.670 --> 00:37:26.680 align:start position:0%
no judges appointed to the Circuit Court
 
00:37:29.630 --> 00:37:29.640 align:start position:0%
are familiar with all aspects of the law
 
00:37:36.150 --> 00:37:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:38.589 --> 00:37:38.599 align:start position:0%
application oh I think I put it before
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
is familiar with all aspects of the law
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
and then Dash familiar
 
00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:48.240 align:start position:0%
with all aspects of La okay all
 
00:37:51.230 --> 00:37:51.240 align:start position:0%
aspects yeah and then Dash okay but the
 
00:37:53.990 --> 00:37:54.000 align:start position:0%
dash still replaces the comma at the end
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
of circuit court change the dash to a
 
00:37:59.430 --> 00:37:59.440 align:start position:0%
comma either I think the dash is that's
 
00:38:01.470 --> 00:38:01.480 align:start position:0%
fine yeah I don't usually use a dash use
 
00:38:03.270 --> 00:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
a comma as a thought
 
00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:07.520 align:start position:0%
braak anything in the next paragraph no
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
third paragraph I have something okay in
 
00:38:11.710 --> 00:38:11.720 align:start position:0%
the third paragraph We have relied on
 
00:38:15.589 --> 00:38:15.599 align:start position:0%
material for multiple sources comma but
 
00:38:15.599 --> 00:38:17.950 align:start position:0%
material for multiple sources comma but
particularly

00:38:17.950 --> 00:38:17.960 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:38:21.589 --> 00:38:21.599 align:start position:0%
in so this is a TI an article title so
 
00:38:24.510 --> 00:38:24.520 align:start position:0%
it should have a a quote after
 
00:38:27.510 --> 00:38:27.520 align:start position:0%
reform Family Justice principles for
 
00:38:30.349 --> 00:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
Family Justice Reform and Family Justice
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
Reform comma quote yep um but I'm
 
00:38:36.390 --> 00:38:36.400 align:start position:0%
challenging the first sentence we have
 
00:38:39.309 --> 00:38:39.319 align:start position:0%
relied on material from multiple sources
 
00:38:39.319 --> 00:38:40.309 align:start position:0%
relied on material from multiple sources
but

00:38:40.309 --> 00:38:40.319 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:38:42.670 --> 00:38:42.680 align:start position:0%
particularly Family Justice I think it
 
00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:45.880 align:start position:0%
should say including from or including
 
00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:48.400 align:start position:0%
but particularly including no I think
 
00:38:50.349 --> 00:38:50.359 align:start position:0%
just instead of particularly and just
 
00:38:54.109 --> 00:38:54.119 align:start position:0%
say including from including Family
 
00:38:57.550 --> 00:38:57.560 align:start position:0%
Justice including from or or including
 
00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
including the but including
 
00:39:04.030 --> 00:39:04.040 align:start position:0%
okay um well you don't need a but so you
 
00:39:05.950 --> 00:39:05.960 align:start position:0%
just take that out because you're you
 
00:39:07.990 --> 00:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
would just say we have relied on
 
00:39:10.870 --> 00:39:10.880 align:start position:0%
material from multiple s multiple
 
00:39:15.829 --> 00:39:15.839 align:start position:0%
sources um including Family Justice okay
 
00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
yes you don't need a
 
00:39:21.670 --> 00:39:21.680 align:start position:0%
butt um Family Justice Reform close
 
00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:24.760 align:start position:0%
quote published in 2019 by the national
 
00:39:28.349 --> 00:39:28.359 align:start position:0%
Center for State Court S
 
00:39:31.470 --> 00:39:31.480 align:start position:0%
period Comm after not comma while direct
 
00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
quotes who acknowledge the general
 
00:39:36.270 --> 00:39:36.280 align:start position:0%
thinking is reflected without necessary
 
00:39:38.589 --> 00:39:38.599 align:start position:0%
attribution period yeah and wall
 
00:39:42.829 --> 00:39:42.839 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be capitalized lowercase w
 
00:39:45.589 --> 00:39:45.599 align:start position:0%
what why no you capitalize it because we
 
00:39:48.430 --> 00:39:48.440 align:start position:0%
had a period after courts it's a period
 
00:39:51.309 --> 00:39:51.319 align:start position:0%
so while direct quotes is
 
00:39:53.550 --> 00:39:53.560 align:start position:0%
capital oh this is supposed to be a
 
00:39:56.390 --> 00:39:56.400 align:start position:0%
period it's a comma a period okay and
 
00:39:58.630 --> 00:39:58.640 align:start position:0%
anything else on the rest of the page
 
00:40:00.710 --> 00:40:00.720 align:start position:0%
yes the next so not the next paragraph
 
00:40:02.470 --> 00:40:02.480 align:start position:0%
but the one after the principles
 
00:40:04.750 --> 00:40:04.760 align:start position:0%
discussed in there should be a t for
 
00:40:08.990 --> 00:40:09.000 align:start position:0%
this report o and then also if you go to
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
the next line development and uh and
 
00:40:14.470 --> 00:40:14.480 align:start position:0%
family Dynamics child abuse comma and
 
00:40:16.950 --> 00:40:16.960 align:start position:0%
substance abuse period okay I've lost
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
where you are okay so the next so
 
00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:21.160 align:start position:0%
there's this on that first line and the
 
00:40:24.109 --> 00:40:24.119 align:start position:0%
principles discuss the second line so
 
00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
this is a um a bunch of thing so after
 
00:40:29.589 --> 00:40:29.599 align:start position:0%
child abuse there's a comma and there
 
00:40:32.270 --> 00:40:32.280 align:start position:0%
should be and substance abuse and
 
00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000 align:start position:0%
substance abuse period period period
 
00:40:40.670 --> 00:40:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:43.470 --> 00:40:43.480 align:start position:0%
okay at the end of that paragraph should
 
00:40:55.309 --> 00:40:55.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:55.319 --> 00:40:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
y

00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:02.829 --> 00:41:02.839 align:start position:0%
it seems the um then representative oh
 
00:41:04.069 --> 00:41:04.079 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry I was going to say it seems
 
00:41:05.750 --> 00:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
like it should be a
 
00:41:07.870 --> 00:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
semicolon after where it says the
 
00:41:10.630 --> 00:41:10.640 align:start position:0%
subcommittee questions the basic premise
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
appropriate and and then these cases
 
00:41:16.430 --> 00:41:16.440 align:start position:0%
yeah and then it should be a semicolon
 
00:41:18.190 --> 00:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
because here's all the questions no it's
 
00:41:20.870 --> 00:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
not a semicolon it's a colon I meant I'm
 
00:41:23.589 --> 00:41:23.599 align:start position:0%
sorry I wrote colen I'm saying semien
 
00:41:25.349 --> 00:41:25.359 align:start position:0%
and then those are the questions and
 
00:41:27.950 --> 00:41:27.960 align:start position:0%
then ref represenative Smith or or I
 
00:41:30.109 --> 00:41:30.119 align:start position:0%
guess Vice chair Smith has a uh
 
00:41:32.870 --> 00:41:32.880 align:start position:0%
correction on the second to last
 
00:41:35.270 --> 00:41:35.280 align:start position:0%
question what about evaluating the logic
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:43.920 --> 00:41:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
interviewing

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
not inure on page 10 it's the old insure
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
Ure to insure insure is life insurance
 
00:42:04.069 --> 00:42:04.079 align:start position:0%
policies to make sure that it happens as
 
00:42:09.829 --> 00:42:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:20.109 --> 00:42:20.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:24.309 --> 00:42:24.319 align:start position:0%
10 okay so if nobody has anything in the
 
00:42:26.790 --> 00:42:26.800 align:start position:0%
first two after insure on that third
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
paragraph um in order for a judge to
 
00:42:31.790 --> 00:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
carry out his and then it should be her
 
00:42:34.910 --> 00:42:34.920 align:start position:0%
not hers his or her judicial
 
00:42:37.750 --> 00:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
duties honestly it should really be
 
00:42:41.349 --> 00:42:41.359 align:start position:0%
there no no it should not be there to
 
00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:45.240 align:start position:0%
carry out their Duty for a judge is not
 
00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:47.520 align:start position:0%
there a judge is singular there is
 
00:42:52.510 --> 00:42:52.520 align:start position:0%
plural a judge his her the new way we're
 
00:42:54.829 --> 00:42:54.839 align:start position:0%
not supposed to say his or
 
00:42:57.670 --> 00:42:57.680 align:start position:0%
hers so no we're not going to we're not
 
00:43:21.549 --> 00:43:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:24.589 --> 00:43:24.599 align:start position:0%
please would it be um that last sentence
 
00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:27.200 align:start position:0%
in that paragraph among theor miad of
 
00:43:29.950 --> 00:43:29.960 align:start position:0%
benefits or is it Myriad benefits Myriad
 
00:43:29.960 --> 00:43:34.670 align:start position:0%
benefits or is it Myriad benefits Myriad
benefits

00:43:34.670 --> 00:43:34.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.349 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:43:36.349 --> 00:43:36.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:43:39.549 --> 00:43:39.559 align:start position:0%
um so I think you know the at the bottom
 
00:43:41.190 --> 00:43:41.200 align:start position:0%
should be capitalized and maybe we can
 
00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
bullet these out so that we understand
 
00:43:46.150 --> 00:43:46.160 align:start position:0%
that that's under the things to consider
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
yeah each each one of these on the next
 
00:43:50.270 --> 00:43:50.280 align:start position:0%
page too there's some are capitalized
 
00:43:51.750 --> 00:43:51.760 align:start position:0%
some or not I think each one of these
 
00:43:53.190 --> 00:43:53.200 align:start position:0%
bullet points should be capitalized at
 
00:43:55.790 --> 00:43:55.800 align:start position:0%
the beginning and the bullet points go
 
00:43:59.790 --> 00:43:59.800 align:start position:0%
all all the way down to this list is not
 
00:44:02.270 --> 00:44:02.280 align:start position:0%
it stops stop what specific and there's
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
Extra Spaces there Extra Spaces and some
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
need a period at theend yeah what's
 
00:44:08.829 --> 00:44:08.839 align:start position:0%
specific yeah some need periods right
 
00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
oh um um here's the stylistic manual
 
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:14.880 align:start position:0%
thing if we're going to Bullet them out
 
00:44:17.109 --> 00:44:17.119 align:start position:0%
each point should end with a period not
 
00:44:20.790 --> 00:44:20.800 align:start position:0%
a semicolon Yes um and we've got uh
 
00:44:23.750 --> 00:44:23.760 align:start position:0%
commas in there once and nothing there
 
00:44:26.470 --> 00:44:26.480 align:start position:0%
so uh now if we're going to Bullet Point
 
00:44:29.870 --> 00:44:29.880 align:start position:0%
these would it not be a a a bad idea
 
00:44:32.790 --> 00:44:32.800 align:start position:0%
toet point bullet point on the bottom of
 
00:44:36.309 --> 00:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
page nine when we had a semic colon
 
00:44:38.990 --> 00:44:39.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me who was looking at each case
 
00:44:40.630 --> 00:44:40.640 align:start position:0%
the the items on the bottom of nine
 
00:44:42.349 --> 00:44:42.359 align:start position:0%
should be bullet pointed yeah for
 
00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
continuity I think that's a good
 
00:44:46.549 --> 00:44:46.559 align:start position:0%
idea well they it ends in a question
 
00:44:48.430 --> 00:44:48.440 align:start position:0%
mark because it is a question nope that
 
00:44:50.870 --> 00:44:50.880 align:start position:0%
one's not bulleted um no but shouldn't
 
00:44:53.309 --> 00:44:53.319 align:start position:0%
it be nope that one that one is the next
 
00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:54.960 align:start position:0%
part of the thing
 
00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:57.150 align:start position:0%
part of the thing
yeah

00:44:57.150 --> 00:44:57.160 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:00.760 align:start position:0%
so uh Vice chair Smith has some a
 
00:45:03.589 --> 00:45:03.599 align:start position:0%
significant change to one of the bullet
 
00:45:05.710 --> 00:45:05.720 align:start position:0%
points on that last since now they're
 
00:45:07.710 --> 00:45:07.720 align:start position:0%
bullet points on the last page of her
 
00:45:11.630 --> 00:45:11.640 align:start position:0%
report page 11 yeah so on the if
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
requiring she crossed out mediation and
 
00:45:17.710 --> 00:45:17.720 align:start position:0%
put neutral case
 
00:45:20.510 --> 00:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
evaluation and then um would effectively
 
00:45:24.309 --> 00:45:24.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:28.230 --> 00:45:28.240 align:start position:0%
therefore therefore the time okay
 
00:45:31.910 --> 00:45:31.920 align:start position:0%
good and then uh that's it for that well
 
00:45:34.910 --> 00:45:34.920 align:start position:0%
wait before we leave that if requiring
 
00:45:37.349 --> 00:45:37.359 align:start position:0%
what do you wish to what does she wish
 
00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:39.359 align:start position:0%
if requiring neutral case
 
00:45:41.790 --> 00:45:41.800 align:start position:0%
evaluation if requiring neutral case
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
would effectively reduce case load and
 
00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:47.200 align:start position:0%
therefore time that any case is in the
 
00:45:49.710 --> 00:45:49.720 align:start position:0%
system huh and therefore the time that
 
00:45:51.549 --> 00:45:51.559 align:start position:0%
any case is in the system therefore for
 
00:45:54.430 --> 00:45:54.440 align:start position:0%
the time okay yeah yeah it should be a
 
00:45:57.470 --> 00:45:57.480 align:start position:0%
period yeah oh so it's a comma and then
 
00:45:58.990 --> 00:45:59.000 align:start position:0%
that line
 
00:46:02.190 --> 00:46:02.200 align:start position:0%
should yeah so that moves up so there so
 
00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:04.280 align:start position:0%
don't so take off the capital W on that
 
00:46:05.510 --> 00:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
in lower case because that's a
 
00:46:07.470 --> 00:46:07.480 align:start position:0%
continuation no no that's the next thing
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
that's a different thing what specific
 
00:46:10.829 --> 00:46:10.839 align:start position:0%
staff should be added to the court yeah
 
00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:13.680 align:start position:0%
that's totally separate thing okay but
 
00:46:15.790 --> 00:46:15.800 align:start position:0%
she's saying if requiring neutri they're
 
00:46:17.870 --> 00:46:17.880 align:start position:0%
they're asking if requiring neutral case
 
00:46:19.829 --> 00:46:19.839 align:start position:0%
evaluation would effectively reduce case
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
load and therefore the time that any
 
00:46:23.910 --> 00:46:23.920 align:start position:0%
cases in the system that makes sense
 
00:46:25.549 --> 00:46:25.559 align:start position:0%
okay well it's an if then statement so
 
00:46:29.470 --> 00:46:29.480 align:start position:0%
what should not be capitalized no well
 
00:46:31.950 --> 00:46:31.960 align:start position:0%
another that's that's no this is an if
 
00:46:35.109 --> 00:46:35.119 align:start position:0%
then statement if all of this that the
 
00:46:38.150 --> 00:46:38.160 align:start position:0%
case in it's an if then
 
00:46:40.910 --> 00:46:40.920 align:start position:0%
statement because you could say if then
 
00:46:44.190 --> 00:46:44.200 align:start position:0%
what specific staff should be if you put
 
00:46:45.950 --> 00:46:45.960 align:start position:0%
the word that's for all the training
 
00:46:48.950 --> 00:46:48.960 align:start position:0%
that's not just for new neutral case
 
00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:51.480 align:start position:0%
evaluation if requiring neutral case
 
00:46:54.150 --> 00:46:54.160 align:start position:0%
evaluation and therefore the time that
 
00:46:56.910 --> 00:46:56.920 align:start position:0%
any case is in the system what now you
 
00:46:58.870 --> 00:46:58.880 align:start position:0%
have a dangling okay so we need to add
 
00:47:00.069 --> 00:47:00.079 align:start position:0%
something but it's not the thing that
 
00:47:02.190 --> 00:47:02.200 align:start position:0%
goes below it um I think it's then what
 
00:47:04.030 --> 00:47:04.040 align:start position:0%
specific staff should be added to the
 
00:47:05.910 --> 00:47:05.920 align:start position:0%
court it's an if then statement I think
 
00:47:07.750 --> 00:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
they go together then what specific stff
 
00:47:09.109 --> 00:47:09.119 align:start position:0%
should be added to the court with
 
00:47:10.990 --> 00:47:11.000 align:start position:0%
responsibilities to best manage the
 
00:47:13.470 --> 00:47:13.480 align:start position:0%
house no CU that's a totally separate
 
00:47:15.910 --> 00:47:15.920 align:start position:0%
thing because evaluation chrisa just
 
00:47:18.670 --> 00:47:18.680 align:start position:0%
said that she could ask her because I I
 
00:47:20.230 --> 00:47:20.240 align:start position:0%
feel like it's the same thought too I
 
00:47:21.750 --> 00:47:21.760 align:start position:0%
felt like that was one thing so
 
00:47:23.349 --> 00:47:23.359 align:start position:0%
Christina said that she would ask her to
 
00:47:25.790 --> 00:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
see what her intent was on that okay
 
00:47:28.829 --> 00:47:28.839 align:start position:0%
particular thing well I think specific
 
00:47:31.870 --> 00:47:31.880 align:start position:0%
staff to be added is a broader thing
 
00:47:34.190 --> 00:47:34.200 align:start position:0%
than just reducing the case load on this
 
00:47:35.829 --> 00:47:35.839 align:start position:0%
one thing I agree I would I would think
 
00:47:37.390 --> 00:47:37.400 align:start position:0%
so but since she's the author of this
 
00:47:38.990 --> 00:47:39.000 align:start position:0%
part I think it would be best for us to
 
00:47:40.750 --> 00:47:40.760 align:start position:0%
see what her thought process was on that
 
00:47:42.710 --> 00:47:42.720 align:start position:0%
so we don't construe something that she
 
00:47:45.069 --> 00:47:45.079 align:start position:0%
was not intending the end therefore is a
 
00:47:48.349 --> 00:47:48.359 align:start position:0%
parental so we'll pass it along as she
 
00:47:51.230 --> 00:47:51.240 align:start position:0%
has written it give her the
 
00:47:53.950 --> 00:47:53.960 align:start position:0%
opportunity yes yeah because Christina
 
00:47:55.510 --> 00:47:55.520 align:start position:0%
said she'd ask her so I think that's
 
00:47:55.520 --> 00:47:57.109 align:start position:0%
said she'd ask her so I think that's
fair

00:47:57.109 --> 00:47:57.119 align:start position:0%
fair
 
00:48:00.670 --> 00:48:00.680 align:start position:0%
so on that last line she um uh Vice
 
00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:03.680 align:start position:0%
chair uh Smith has rather it represents
 
00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:05.920 align:start position:0%
some of so that first line at the end
 
00:48:09.950 --> 00:48:09.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
h thinking of the committee
 
00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.829 align:start position:0%
h thinking of the committee
[Music]

00:48:13.829 --> 00:48:13.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:48:16.910 --> 00:48:16.920 align:start position:0%
work anything else on
 
00:48:18.589 --> 00:48:18.599 align:start position:0%
11 this
 
00:48:21.630 --> 00:48:21.640 align:start position:0%
is oh yeah it should be exclusive yeah
 
00:48:24.630 --> 00:48:24.640 align:start position:0%
should this list is not
 
00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:27.150 align:start position:0%
should this list is not
exclusive

00:48:27.150 --> 00:48:27.160 align:start position:0%
exclusive
 
00:48:28.670 --> 00:48:28.680 align:start position:0%
meaning that they're other it's not
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:37.430 --> 00:48:37.440 align:start position:0%
catch okay anybody else on 11 thank
 
00:48:37.440 --> 00:48:39.230 align:start position:0%
catch okay anybody else on 11 thank
you

00:48:39.230 --> 00:48:39.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:48:41.910 --> 00:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
and all right
 
00:48:46.790 --> 00:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
12 going back to um page two page two
 
00:48:50.270 --> 00:48:50.280 align:start position:0%

clerks yeah on no process proced see
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:37.829 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:49:37.829 --> 00:49:37.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.950 --> 00:49:40.960 align:start position:0%
okay uh Mr D do we have
 
00:49:44.950 --> 00:49:44.960 align:start position:0%
this on on page on page two the the
 
00:49:46.950 --> 00:49:46.960 align:start position:0%
third to last paragraph rate under
 
00:49:50.510 --> 00:49:50.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:54.069 --> 00:49:54.079 align:start position:0%
yeah no we are back to page two for two
 
00:49:59.910 --> 00:49:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:02.190 --> 00:50:02.200 align:start position:0%
page um the third to last paragraph
 
00:50:03.990 --> 00:50:04.000 align:start position:0%
under processes and procedures it should
 
00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:04.910 align:start position:0%
under processes and procedures it should
say

00:50:04.910 --> 00:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
say
 
00:50:07.190 --> 00:50:07.200 align:start position:0%
Representatives Caitlyn cab and Lori
 
00:50:09.069 --> 00:50:09.079 align:start position:0%
ball acted as clerks and then he also
 
00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
wanted to put at the top comma clerk
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
names uh is that what that's arguable
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
because the speaker didn't make that
 
00:50:21.030 --> 00:50:21.040 align:start position:0%
appointment that's fine you don't have
 
00:50:23.309 --> 00:50:23.319 align:start position:0%
to do that so I would say no because
 
00:50:26.430 --> 00:50:26.440 align:start position:0%
it'll be picked up in when it's
 
00:50:30.309 --> 00:50:30.319 align:start position:0%
my thing so no the speaker appointed uh
 
00:50:32.549 --> 00:50:32.559 align:start position:0%
Pearson and Smith and then I in turn
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
appointed kavan ball so that's
 
00:50:36.430 --> 00:50:36.440 align:start position:0%
referenced third
 
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:40.799 align:start position:0%
from the bottom okay are we can we go to
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
page last page
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
12 yeah so um during the first
 
00:50:49.190 --> 00:50:49.200 align:start position:0%
subcommittee meeting and it should say
 
00:50:53.910 --> 00:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:58.510 --> 00:50:58.520 align:start position:0%
2023 and then if if you can add
 
00:51:02.150 --> 00:51:02.160 align:start position:0%
um uh where it says uh from the
 
00:51:05.030 --> 00:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and add the word later I do
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
not know where you are right now later
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
spoke with judges Ashley lamir and
 
00:51:10.910 --> 00:51:10.920 align:start position:0%
because I want to make it clear that
 
00:51:12.589 --> 00:51:12.599 align:start position:0%
they weren't there she later spoke with
 
00:51:14.910 --> 00:51:14.920 align:start position:0%
them to get this information okay
 
00:51:16.710 --> 00:51:16.720 align:start position:0%
everybody have that where's that at the
 
00:51:18.470 --> 00:51:18.480 align:start position:0%
second to last paragraph So during the
 
00:51:20.349 --> 00:51:20.359 align:start position:0%
first subcommittee meeting on October
 
00:51:24.109 --> 00:51:24.119 align:start position:0%
17th 2023 oh and later spoke with judge
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
Judes Ashley okay at the top oh we got
 
00:51:30.109 --> 00:51:30.119 align:start position:0%
that now yes got that okay at the top
 
00:51:32.750 --> 00:51:32.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittee please put representative
 
00:51:39.069 --> 00:51:39.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:41.390 --> 00:51:41.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittee and I think we take out
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
interim Report Draft y because the whole
 
00:51:48.630 --> 00:51:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:52.670 --> 00:51:52.680 align:start position:0%
report so uh representative long was
 
00:51:54.630 --> 00:51:54.640 align:start position:0%
there as a substitute for uh
 
00:51:57.630 --> 00:51:57.640 align:start position:0%
representative C tab uh at the chair
 
00:51:59.789 --> 00:51:59.799 align:start position:0%
position so do we need to note that in
 
00:52:03.030 --> 00:52:03.040 align:start position:0%
this CU he he presided over the meeting
 
00:52:05.349 --> 00:52:05.359 align:start position:0%
that she couldn't be at well that would
 
00:52:07.030 --> 00:52:07.040 align:start position:0%
have to be down in the other paragraph
 
00:52:10.069 --> 00:52:10.079 align:start position:0%
where it says on October 17 2023 during
 
00:52:11.470 --> 00:52:11.480 align:start position:0%
the first subcommittee meeting but I
 
00:52:12.789 --> 00:52:12.799 align:start position:0%
don't know if we need to get that much
 
00:52:18.150 --> 00:52:18.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:20.349 --> 00:52:20.359 align:start position:0%
okay because this is going to carry on
 
00:52:22.109 --> 00:52:22.119 align:start position:0%
to be all the meetings that we have that
 
00:52:24.870 --> 00:52:24.880 align:start position:0%
was just our first meeting and is this
 
00:52:27.190 --> 00:52:27.200 align:start position:0%
the only one of the committee reports
 
00:52:29.390 --> 00:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
where we just group everybody I just
 
00:52:31.750 --> 00:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
wanted to be consistent like yeah we did
 
00:52:33.870 --> 00:52:33.880 align:start position:0%
on all I think on all of them I did not
 
00:52:35.349 --> 00:52:35.359 align:start position:0%
group it on mine so maybe we should
 
00:52:35.359 --> 00:52:37.990 align:start position:0%
group it on mine so maybe we should
group

00:52:37.990 --> 00:52:38.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:41.270 --> 00:52:41.280 align:start position:0%
mine yeah I see where everybody else is
 
00:52:44.270 --> 00:52:44.280 align:start position:0%
grouped um and then do you have I had
 
00:52:54.230 --> 00:52:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.430 align:start position:0%
 
those

00:52:57.430 --> 00:52:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:59.950 --> 00:52:59.960 align:start position:0%
uh Miss Dyer and I had a conversation
 
00:53:02.109 --> 00:53:02.119 align:start position:0%
about how thick we wanted the report to
 
00:53:03.870 --> 00:53:03.880 align:start position:0%
be did we want minutes of all the
 
00:53:05.670 --> 00:53:05.680 align:start position:0%
meetings did we want every piece of
 
00:53:08.430 --> 00:53:08.440 align:start position:0%
testimony that was given
 
00:53:14.309 --> 00:53:14.319 align:start position:0%
verbally uh or via email or um reports
 
00:53:17.150 --> 00:53:17.160 align:start position:0%
from different agencies and so on and
 
00:53:18.549 --> 00:53:18.559 align:start position:0%
you know that's going to make one heck
 
00:53:21.910 --> 00:53:21.920 align:start position:0%
of a thick report I thought that at this
 
00:53:23.990 --> 00:53:24.000 align:start position:0%
point we simply wanted to give the
 
00:53:27.349 --> 00:53:27.359 align:start position:0%
speaker an update he's asked me he asked
 
00:53:29.589 --> 00:53:29.599 align:start position:0%
the chairs of the special committees
 
00:53:31.829 --> 00:53:31.839 align:start position:0%
about a month ago to meet with him to
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
give an update this is an update that is
 
00:53:37.309 --> 00:53:37.319 align:start position:0%
written and as of the end probably of
 
00:53:39.870 --> 00:53:39.880 align:start position:0%
this calendar year for most of us and I
 
00:53:42.390 --> 00:53:42.400 align:start position:0%
thought that putting all of that other
 
00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:44.680 align:start position:0%
stuff in there is way more than he wants
 
00:53:48.150 --> 00:53:48.160 align:start position:0%
or will read and all the extra reports
 
00:53:50.230 --> 00:53:50.240 align:start position:0%
for archival
 
00:53:53.309 --> 00:53:53.319 align:start position:0%
purposes could go when it we make our
 
00:53:57.750 --> 00:53:57.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:00.349 --> 00:54:00.359 align:start position:0%
um based on that I I just didn't want
 
00:54:02.510 --> 00:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
him to have to read a summary of what
 
00:54:04.069 --> 00:54:04.079 align:start position:0%
those appendices say I thought it was
 
00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:05.400 align:start position:0%
easier to just put in the appendix
 
00:54:06.950 --> 00:54:06.960 align:start position:0%
because he probably won't bother to look
 
00:54:10.030 --> 00:54:10.040 align:start position:0%
at them um but if we take out appendix a
 
00:54:11.470 --> 00:54:11.480 align:start position:0%
and appendix B then that means we would
 
00:54:13.190 --> 00:54:13.200 align:start position:0%
need to make this longer by summarizing
 
00:54:15.910 --> 00:54:15.920 align:start position:0%
them and he couldn't I I'm fine doing it
 
00:54:17.230 --> 00:54:17.240 align:start position:0%
but we would just need to summarize what
 
00:54:19.390 --> 00:54:19.400 align:start position:0%
does a what was in appendix a and what
 
00:54:23.109 --> 00:54:23.119 align:start position:0%
was in appendix B if we have a a brief
 
00:54:27.270 --> 00:54:27.280 align:start position:0%
paragraph summarizing a appendix A and B
 
00:54:29.109 --> 00:54:29.119 align:start position:0%
yeah you know not long you know four or
 
00:54:31.950 --> 00:54:31.960 align:start position:0%
five sentences at most then I would
 
00:54:33.670 --> 00:54:33.680 align:start position:0%
suggest we
 
00:54:36.670 --> 00:54:36.680 align:start position:0%
strike they provided the information in
 
00:54:39.150 --> 00:54:39.160 align:start position:0%
appendix B and in the previous paragraph
 
00:54:42.309 --> 00:54:42.319 align:start position:0%
this information is provided in appendix
 
00:54:46.950 --> 00:54:46.960 align:start position:0%
a um and and substitute a
 
00:54:50.150 --> 00:54:50.160 align:start position:0%
summary of what they said was and that
 
00:54:53.549 --> 00:54:53.559 align:start position:0%
could be footnoted just not or it could
 
00:54:56.109 --> 00:54:56.119 align:start position:0%
be in the body of the text so the
 
00:54:58.910 --> 00:54:58.920 align:start position:0%
appendix B part um it's easy to kind of
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
strike I can just kind of a strike out
 
00:55:03.190 --> 00:55:03.200 align:start position:0%
the appendix a part but the appendix B
 
00:55:04.950 --> 00:55:04.960 align:start position:0%
part was a list of several questions
 
00:55:06.470 --> 00:55:06.480 align:start position:0%
that we asked and I'm not sure that they
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
could really be summarized because they
 
00:55:09.589 --> 00:55:09.599 align:start position:0%
were independent questions I think we'd
 
00:55:11.069 --> 00:55:11.079 align:start position:0%
just have I'd have to kind of copy them
 
00:55:13.750 --> 00:55:13.760 align:start position:0%
in there they it was a pretty it was a
 
00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:18.640 align:start position:0%
summary so I I think that um in in
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
looking at the other reports that we
 
00:55:23.789 --> 00:55:23.799 align:start position:0%
have in just saying that during the
 
00:55:25.430 --> 00:55:25.440 align:start position:0%
subcommittee that we asked these
 
00:55:26.710 --> 00:55:26.720 align:start position:0%
questions or whatever this is just a
 
00:55:28.349 --> 00:55:28.359 align:start position:0%
summary to kind of update in where we
 
00:55:30.150 --> 00:55:30.160 align:start position:0%
are I actually don't think you need to
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
have all of that stuff in here I think
 
00:55:34.829 --> 00:55:34.839 align:start position:0%
this would suffice if you strike the
 
00:55:36.630 --> 00:55:36.640 align:start position:0%
appendix a and appendix B I think when
 
00:55:38.430 --> 00:55:38.440 align:start position:0%
we do a full report that would be
 
00:55:40.230 --> 00:55:40.240 align:start position:0%
necessary then but since this is just an
 
00:55:41.630 --> 00:55:41.640 align:start position:0%
update like summary I actually don't
 
00:55:43.670 --> 00:55:43.680 align:start position:0%
think it's necessary okay so I think in
 
00:55:46.029 --> 00:55:46.039 align:start position:0%
the first paragraph or the middle par I
 
00:55:47.349 --> 00:55:47.359 align:start position:0%
guess the middle paragraph there we can
 
00:55:49.710 --> 00:55:49.720 align:start position:0%
get rid of this information as a p is
 
00:55:52.390 --> 00:55:52.400 align:start position:0%
provided in appendix a that's
 
00:55:55.270 --> 00:55:55.280 align:start position:0%
fine um if you want to say that they
 
00:55:56.630 --> 00:55:56.640 align:start position:0%
just asked the questions and not even
 
00:55:57.789 --> 00:55:57.799 align:start position:0%
talk about what they were we can just
 
00:55:59.309 --> 00:55:59.319 align:start position:0%
get rid of they provided the information
 
00:56:01.789 --> 00:56:01.799 align:start position:0%
in appendex B and then we're done yeah I
 
00:56:03.670 --> 00:56:03.680 align:start position:0%
think that works for this particular
 
00:56:05.430 --> 00:56:05.440 align:start position:0%
report especially because this is an
 
00:56:07.589 --> 00:56:07.599 align:start position:0%
ongoing we're not done with this
 
00:56:09.390 --> 00:56:09.400 align:start position:0%
particular one so I think this is a good
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
update it's well written yeah I felt the
 
00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:14.760 align:start position:0%
need in the um report on Rules of
 
00:56:17.430 --> 00:56:17.440 align:start position:0%
Evidence to break out some examples
 
00:56:19.230 --> 00:56:19.240 align:start position:0%
because that was our final report we're
 
00:56:21.950 --> 00:56:21.960 align:start position:0%
done but yeah if if a subcommittee
 
00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:23.069 align:start position:0%
done but yeah if if a subcommittee
continues

00:56:23.069 --> 00:56:23.079 align:start position:0%
continues
 
00:56:25.910 --> 00:56:25.920 align:start position:0%
on um let's see what even what the
 
00:56:27.710 --> 00:56:27.720 align:start position:0%
answers to those questions might be and
 
00:56:29.589 --> 00:56:29.599 align:start position:0%
that would be part of the final report I
 
00:56:31.109 --> 00:56:31.119 align:start position:0%
would think so yeah she gave us the
 
00:56:32.510 --> 00:56:32.520 align:start position:0%
answers to the questions but we can put
 
00:56:35.510 --> 00:56:35.520 align:start position:0%
them in the final I think so I think so
 
00:56:38.630 --> 00:56:38.640 align:start position:0%
anything else on page 12 I'd only say
 
00:56:42.029 --> 00:56:42.039 align:start position:0%
one other thing and just for for um to
 
00:56:42.039 --> 00:56:42.829 align:start position:0%
one other thing and just for for um to
keep

00:56:42.829 --> 00:56:42.839 align:start position:0%
keep
 
00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:46.680 align:start position:0%
it un um looking the same as the term we
 
00:56:49.029 --> 00:56:49.039 align:start position:0%
in particularly we and it should be the
 
00:56:50.829 --> 00:56:50.839 align:start position:0%
committee it would follow the same way
 
00:56:52.309 --> 00:56:52.319 align:start position:0%
that you wrote it down here the sub
 
00:56:55.309 --> 00:56:55.319 align:start position:0%
committee comme down here so will be the
 
00:56:57.510 --> 00:56:57.520 align:start position:0%
first full paragraph the second line
 
00:56:59.430 --> 00:56:59.440 align:start position:0%
particularly the committee wanted to
 
00:57:03.029 --> 00:57:03.039 align:start position:0%
look instead of we okay just for
 
00:57:03.039 --> 00:57:13.470 align:start position:0%
look instead of we okay just for
continuity

00:57:13.470 --> 00:57:13.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:16.789 --> 00:57:16.799 align:start position:0%
yep okay so on that note we have to go
 
00:57:18.270 --> 00:57:18.280 align:start position:0%
back to the forms
 
00:57:22.670 --> 00:57:22.680 align:start position:0%
one which is Page what which is Page uh
 
00:57:25.349 --> 00:57:25.359 align:start position:0%
it's a great question um
 
00:57:29.150 --> 00:57:29.160 align:start position:0%
one two three four five six seven page 8
 
00:57:31.630 --> 00:57:31.640 align:start position:0%
so there's we a few times so I believe
 
00:57:33.829 --> 00:57:33.839 align:start position:0%
it should read whatever we've decided
 
00:57:35.309 --> 00:57:35.319 align:start position:0%
that sub committee the subc commmittee
 
00:57:38.109 --> 00:57:38.119 align:start position:0%
rather than we so each time we see we so
 
00:57:41.230 --> 00:57:41.240 align:start position:0%
there's on that first paragraph We
 
00:57:45.029 --> 00:57:45.039 align:start position:0%
visited uh second paragraph we get rid
 
00:57:45.990 --> 00:57:46.000 align:start position:0%
of all the
 
00:57:49.630 --> 00:57:49.640 align:start position:0%
Wiis um and then as and then on that
 
00:57:53.190 --> 00:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
third the next paragraph overall we felt
 
00:57:55.430 --> 00:57:55.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable and then there's
 
00:57:58.230 --> 00:57:58.240 align:start position:0%
another we as we hear from
 
00:58:00.190 --> 00:58:00.200 align:start position:0%
constituents and then at the very last
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
sentence at this time the subcommittee
 
00:58:04.270 --> 00:58:04.280 align:start position:0%
does not feel the need for future
 
00:58:08.750 --> 00:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
meetings period for future meetings okay
 
00:58:11.029 --> 00:58:11.039 align:start position:0%
period just for
 
00:58:13.710 --> 00:58:13.720 align:start position:0%
consistent thank you and then get rid of
 
00:58:16.029 --> 00:58:16.039 align:start position:0%
the dash before subcommittee on that
 
00:58:18.230 --> 00:58:18.240 align:start position:0%
third to last paragraph like it should
 
00:58:21.150 --> 00:58:21.160 align:start position:0%
just be subcommittee
 
00:58:22.990 --> 00:58:23.000 align:start position:0%
Dash right
 
00:58:33.029 --> 00:58:33.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:36.549 --> 00:58:36.559 align:start position:0%
I think when we do the final report um
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
we can certainly go through for
 
00:58:42.029 --> 00:58:42.039 align:start position:0%
continuity of style and you know if we
 
00:58:44.390 --> 00:58:44.400 align:start position:0%
capitalize the court the word Court one
 
00:58:46.990 --> 00:58:47.000 align:start position:0%
place we should everywhere um I don't
 
00:58:50.870 --> 00:58:50.880 align:start position:0%
think it is as urgent presently but
 
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:53.760 align:start position:0%
because I don't think this report um
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
will be broadly disseminated I don't
 
00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:58.760 align:start position:0%
think so anyway I got to talk to the
 
00:59:00.589 --> 00:59:00.599 align:start position:0%
speaker about that but I think it's
 
00:59:02.789 --> 00:59:02.799 align:start position:0%
mostly for him and us I mean I think it
 
00:59:05.789 --> 00:59:05.799 align:start position:0%
takes only a minute to kind of just yeah
 
00:59:07.950 --> 00:59:07.960 align:start position:0%
let's take let's take a last minute
 
00:59:09.630 --> 00:59:09.640 align:start position:0%
after we' print out all the are you
 
00:59:11.390 --> 00:59:11.400 align:start position:0%
making the changes while we're going or
 
00:59:14.349 --> 00:59:14.359 align:start position:0%
no no okay you're doing it hard copy are
 
00:59:14.359 --> 00:59:23.630 align:start position:0%
no no okay you're doing it hard copy are
you

00:59:23.630 --> 00:59:23.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:47.870 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:59:47.870 --> 00:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:50.950 --> 00:59:50.960 align:start position:0%
so then after you make the changes will
 
00:59:53.270 --> 00:59:53.280 align:start position:0%
will we see the report or like what's
 
01:00:09.829 --> 01:00:09.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:11.349 align:start position:0%
 
also

01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:11.359 align:start position:0%
also
 
01:00:13.630 --> 01:00:13.640 align:start position:0%
you I think that's perfect because you
 
01:00:15.630 --> 01:00:15.640 align:start position:0%
know when even like for bills they can
 
01:00:18.029 --> 01:00:18.039 align:start position:0%
always do a a clerical Amendment
 
01:00:21.190 --> 01:00:21.200 align:start position:0%
afterwards so we we voted on it if she
 
01:00:22.750 --> 01:00:22.760 align:start position:0%
after she sends it if we have any
 
01:00:25.430 --> 01:00:25.440 align:start position:0%
clerical grammatical whatever you
 
01:00:29.549 --> 01:00:29.559 align:start position:0%
can at that point is the is the request
 
01:00:33.150 --> 01:00:33.160 align:start position:0%
that we would see this committee would
 
01:00:36.589 --> 01:00:36.599 align:start position:0%
see the changes before it goes to the
 
01:00:40.710 --> 01:00:40.720 align:start position:0%
speaker or the next item out goes to us
 
01:00:42.309 --> 01:00:42.319 align:start position:0%
and to the speaker at the same time
 
01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:44.160 align:start position:0%
what's your pleasure team I'd like to
 
01:00:45.430 --> 01:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
see it first just to make sure
 
01:00:47.549 --> 01:00:47.559 align:start position:0%
everything was captured before it goes
 
01:00:49.390 --> 01:00:49.400 align:start position:0%
well since we're waiting on uh Vice
 
01:00:52.589 --> 01:00:52.599 align:start position:0%
chair Smith's uh correction or whatever
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
on that particular paragraph too it
 
01:00:55.950 --> 01:00:55.960 align:start position:0%
might just be good if we look it up if
 
01:00:57.750 --> 01:00:57.760 align:start position:0%
we all see it and then it goes because I
 
01:01:00.069 --> 01:01:00.079 align:start position:0%
think we could say okay once we get it
 
01:01:02.230 --> 01:01:02.240 align:start position:0%
like within 24 hours it has to go to the
 
01:01:04.910 --> 01:01:04.920 align:start position:0%
speaker like we need to get any edits in
 
01:01:07.630 --> 01:01:07.640 align:start position:0%
immediately okay so when we're finished
 
01:01:09.150 --> 01:01:09.160 align:start position:0%
uh when you're finished making the
 
01:01:13.309 --> 01:01:13.319 align:start position:0%
changes please send the amended report
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
to all of us and then we'll have a day
 
01:01:18.390 --> 01:01:18.400 align:start position:0%
or so to go through it and you can let
 
01:01:22.230 --> 01:01:22.240 align:start position:0%
um the vice chair know on this and if it
 
01:01:24.150 --> 01:01:24.160 align:start position:0%
looks good to all of us out the door it
 
01:01:24.160 --> 01:01:25.309 align:start position:0%
looks good to all of us out the door it
goes

01:01:25.309 --> 01:01:25.319 align:start position:0%
goes
 
01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:28.480 align:start position:0%
okay the only uh other item of business
 
01:01:30.670 --> 01:01:30.680 align:start position:0%
I think is we have two
 
01:01:35.309 --> 01:01:35.319 align:start position:0%
subcommittees and they may meet as the
 
01:01:39.670 --> 01:01:39.680 align:start position:0%
chairs of those subcommittees choose uh
 
01:01:43.470 --> 01:01:43.480 align:start position:0%
just alert uh me uh certainly if you
 
01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:45.760 align:start position:0%
want to meet at a time when your
 
01:01:47.990 --> 01:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee can all gather then
 
01:01:50.430 --> 01:01:50.440 align:start position:0%
remember it has to be noticed it is a
 
01:01:53.510 --> 01:01:53.520 align:start position:0%
public meeting so it has to be noticed
 
01:01:56.470 --> 01:01:56.480 align:start position:0%
and uh in advance enough
 
01:01:59.950 --> 01:01:59.960 align:start position:0%
time um send that to me I'll make sure
 
01:02:03.549 --> 01:02:03.559 align:start position:0%
that it gets to the appropriate people
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
uh special Kay I think right is the
 
01:02:12.230 --> 01:02:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:15.029 --> 01:02:15.039 align:start position:0%
right you can't do three things at once
 
01:02:16.549 --> 01:02:16.559 align:start position:0%
he's talking about noticing the
 
01:02:19.750 --> 01:02:19.760 align:start position:0%
subcommittees when the subcommittees uh
 
01:02:22.309 --> 01:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
decide they want to meet they should let
 
01:02:28.069 --> 01:02:28.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.589 --> 01:02:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.029 --> 01:02:43.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:45.630 --> 01:02:45.640 align:start position:0%
uh so I mean if you guys want to meet
 
01:02:47.430 --> 01:02:47.440 align:start position:0%
before the end of the year fine I might
 
01:02:49.710 --> 01:02:49.720 align:start position:0%
suggest that because it's going to get
 
01:02:53.029 --> 01:02:53.039 align:start position:0%
busy how many bills between the House
 
01:02:55.430 --> 01:02:55.440 align:start position:0%
and Senate I I heard it was last up to
 
01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.589 align:start position:0%
and Senate I I heard it was last up to
about

01:02:56.589 --> 01:02:56.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:03:00.190 --> 01:03:00.200 align:start position:0%
1150 and Rising do you want us to
 
01:03:01.910 --> 01:03:01.920 align:start position:0%
contact you for the subcommittee or do
 
01:03:04.029 --> 01:03:04.039 align:start position:0%
you want us to to contact Karen directly
 
01:03:06.630 --> 01:03:06.640 align:start position:0%
to schedule
 
01:03:11.390 --> 01:03:11.400 align:start position:0%
it me okay and then I'll pass it along
 
01:03:14.829 --> 01:03:14.839 align:start position:0%
okay um but I really do suggest I
 
01:03:18.870 --> 01:03:18.880 align:start position:0%
encourage I exhort you do this a while
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
it's still fresh in your mind and B
 
01:03:23.670 --> 01:03:23.680 align:start position:0%
despite the runup to holidays um it's
 
01:03:25.670 --> 01:03:25.680 align:start position:0%
going to get worse in
 
01:03:28.470 --> 01:03:28.480 align:start position:0%
January so I'd suggest we do that then
 
01:03:31.789 --> 01:03:31.799 align:start position:0%
we can schedule a meeting a final
 
01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:33.319 align:start position:0%
meeting of this
 
01:03:37.190 --> 01:03:37.200 align:start position:0%
committee uh approve the reports from
 
01:03:40.309 --> 01:03:40.319 align:start position:0%
the two committees we've already decided
 
01:03:42.269 --> 01:03:42.279 align:start position:0%
we don't want to form any more
 
01:03:46.190 --> 01:03:46.200 align:start position:0%
committees to start next year uh then we
 
01:03:48.589 --> 01:03:48.599 align:start position:0%
can give
 
01:03:53.549 --> 01:03:53.559 align:start position:0%
um Miss Dia enough time to compile all
 
01:03:58.510 --> 01:03:58.520 align:start position:0%
the appendices and reports and minutes
 
01:04:01.549 --> 01:04:01.559 align:start position:0%
and things we think should be in the
 
01:04:04.029 --> 01:04:04.039 align:start position:0%
report um and then schedule a meeting it
 
01:04:06.870 --> 01:04:06.880 align:start position:0%
shouldn't take long for us to
 
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
uh do the final approval and declare
 
01:04:13.349 --> 01:04:13.359 align:start position:0%
Victory and for a party what about the
 
01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:16.760 align:start position:0%
DV um part that we had me talked about
 
01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:17.589 align:start position:0%
DV um part that we had me talked about
last

01:04:17.589 --> 01:04:17.599 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:04:22.750 --> 01:04:22.760 align:start position:0%
week what about it uh will we will we be
 
01:04:28.269 --> 01:04:28.279 align:start position:0%
doing that committee or or requesting
 
01:04:28.279 --> 01:04:32.910 align:start position:0%
doing that committee or or requesting
that

01:04:32.910 --> 01:04:32.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:36.829 --> 01:04:36.839 align:start position:0%
committee what did we conclude last
 
01:04:39.069 --> 01:04:39.079 align:start position:0%
week I'm not sure that we concluded
 
01:04:41.069 --> 01:04:41.079 align:start position:0%
anything other than most of the members
 
01:04:43.510 --> 01:04:43.520 align:start position:0%
thought it would be a good idea to to
 
01:04:45.349 --> 01:04:45.359 align:start position:0%
have a subcommittee on domestic violence
 
01:04:46.670 --> 01:04:46.680 align:start position:0%
a subcommittee
 
01:04:50.309 --> 01:04:50.319 align:start position:0%
of of Judiciary children Family Law And
 
01:04:52.950 --> 01:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
Criminal Justice Criminal Justice okay
 
01:04:57.789 --> 01:04:57.799 align:start position:0%
that is what is on my wish list to see
 
01:05:00.630 --> 01:05:00.640 align:start position:0%
if the speaker has changed his mind
 
01:05:02.269 --> 01:05:02.279 align:start position:0%
because when I brought it up to him he
 
01:05:03.870 --> 01:05:03.880 align:start position:0%
was not
 
01:05:07.990 --> 01:05:08.000 align:start position:0%
favorable I tried to make the case that
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.079 --> 01:05:32.789 align:start position:0%
 
groups

01:05:32.789 --> 01:05:32.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.430 --> 01:05:36.440 align:start position:0%
my suggestion to everybody on this
 
01:05:38.829 --> 01:05:38.839 align:start position:0%
special committee regarding the subject
 
01:05:40.589 --> 01:05:40.599 align:start position:0%
of domestic
 
01:05:45.269 --> 01:05:45.279 align:start position:0%
violence please as many of you as wish
 
01:05:47.950 --> 01:05:47.960 align:start position:0%
send me a couple of paragraphs to help
 
01:05:51.029 --> 01:05:51.039 align:start position:0%
me make my case to the speaker why there
 
01:05:54.710 --> 01:05:54.720 align:start position:0%
should be such a committee because
 
01:05:56.789 --> 01:05:56.799 align:start position:0%
I have to convince
 
01:06:00.950 --> 01:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
him and I want as many good points
 
01:06:03.230 --> 01:06:03.240 align:start position:0%
including points we do not share
 
01:06:07.549 --> 01:06:07.559 align:start position:0%
broadly why he should do this because
 
01:06:10.309 --> 01:06:10.319 align:start position:0%
he's a reasonable guy if you make the
 
01:06:12.269 --> 01:06:12.279 align:start position:0%
case he'll do
 
01:06:15.789 --> 01:06:15.799 align:start position:0%
something so soon as you want to send me
 
01:06:17.750 --> 01:06:17.760 align:start position:0%
those things I'll give it a week or two
 
01:06:19.470 --> 01:06:19.480 align:start position:0%
I have a meeting with him next week
 
01:06:21.829 --> 01:06:21.839 align:start position:0%
after the Chairman's meeting on Tuesday
 
01:06:23.750 --> 01:06:23.760 align:start position:0%
I'm in his office this made me a good
 
01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:25.150 align:start position:0%
I'm in his office this made me a good
time

01:06:25.150 --> 01:06:25.160 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:27.670 align:start position:0%
time
sound

01:06:27.670 --> 01:06:27.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:29.710 --> 01:06:29.720 align:start position:0%
good thank
 
01:06:33.069 --> 01:06:33.079 align:start position:0%
you any other
 
01:06:36.109 --> 01:06:36.119 align:start position:0%
business oh so the notes that I took
 
01:06:39.510 --> 01:06:39.520 align:start position:0%
from last week in addition to or um was
 
01:06:41.190 --> 01:06:41.200 align:start position:0%
the domestic violence and I don't know
 
01:06:42.910 --> 01:06:42.920 align:start position:0%
why but I have it written down for child
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
abuse and child neglect create a
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
subcommittee for this I think those were
 
01:06:47.470 --> 01:06:47.480 align:start position:0%
we were talking about when the spring
 
01:06:49.510 --> 01:06:49.520 align:start position:0%
comes perhaps adding another
 
01:06:51.150 --> 01:06:51.160 align:start position:0%
subcommittee so that would we would be
 
01:06:53.630 --> 01:06:53.640 align:start position:0%
doing in the spring just so I but I do
 
01:06:55.150 --> 01:06:55.160 align:start position:0%
have the domestic violence in there as
 
01:06:57.269 --> 01:06:57.279 align:start position:0%
well to make recommendation to create a
 
01:06:59.269 --> 01:06:59.279 align:start position:0%
special committee to address multiple
 
01:07:01.750 --> 01:07:01.760 align:start position:0%
issues am I correct in assuming last
 
01:07:04.349 --> 01:07:04.359 align:start position:0%
week we concluded that when the two
 
01:07:07.230 --> 01:07:07.240 align:start position:0%
subcommittees of this special committee
 
01:07:10.069 --> 01:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
are done their work and we've approved
 
01:07:12.870 --> 01:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
their reports we are
 
01:07:15.150 --> 01:07:15.160 align:start position:0%
done that was the conclusion I thought
 
01:07:18.230 --> 01:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
we made so we can make recommendations
 
01:07:22.390 --> 01:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:24.910 --> 01:07:24.920 align:start position:0%
um she cleared if that we have another
 
01:07:27.069 --> 01:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
year to continue work on the process so
 
01:07:30.589 --> 01:07:30.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:32.950 --> 01:07:32.960 align:start position:0%
committee but only to work on the things
 
01:07:34.430 --> 01:07:34.440 align:start position:0%
that we had mentioned
 
01:07:37.190 --> 01:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
before then down here I know but I don't
 
01:07:41.069 --> 01:07:41.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:43.870 --> 01:07:43.880 align:start position:0%
possible no this these are my notes from
 
01:07:43.880 --> 01:07:45.109 align:start position:0%
possible no this these are my notes from
that

01:07:45.109 --> 01:07:45.119 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:07:47.430 --> 01:07:47.440 align:start position:0%
meeting I want to repeat my question
 
01:07:49.549 --> 01:07:49.559 align:start position:0%
when we're done are we done or are we
 
01:07:52.630 --> 01:07:52.640 align:start position:0%
not done I I think I'm confused by the
 
01:07:53.950 --> 01:07:53.960 align:start position:0%
question that you're asking are you
 
01:07:55.630 --> 01:07:55.640 align:start position:0%
saying that we're this special committee
 
01:07:59.109 --> 01:07:59.119 align:start position:0%
is done will dissolve it doesn't exist
 
01:08:04.029 --> 01:08:04.039 align:start position:0%
anymore at the time when we have this
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
kind of meeting to approve the final
 
01:08:11.549 --> 01:08:11.559 align:start position:0%
report based on are getting the two
 
01:08:13.510 --> 01:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
subcommittees that are continuing their
 
01:08:15.269 --> 01:08:15.279 align:start position:0%
work when they believe they're done
 
01:08:19.149 --> 01:08:19.159 align:start position:0%
their work they will file their final
 
01:08:22.950 --> 01:08:22.960 align:start position:0%
reports as subcommittees we will meet to
 
01:08:26.030 --> 01:08:26.040 align:start position:0%
approve make changes of that and
 
01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:29.239 align:start position:0%
anything else in the final report and
 
01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:32.319 align:start position:0%
that's it we are not forming any more
 
01:08:35.390 --> 01:08:35.400 align:start position:0%
subcommittees we are not doing anything
 
01:08:39.229 --> 01:08:39.239 align:start position:0%
else that will be the end of this that
 
01:08:42.590 --> 01:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
should be clear and I believe we agreed
 
01:08:44.309 --> 01:08:44.319 align:start position:0%
to that last
 
01:08:46.990 --> 01:08:47.000 align:start position:0%
time yes I think also we talked about as
 
01:08:49.430 --> 01:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
far as what we were charged to do is
 
01:08:51.030 --> 01:08:51.040 align:start position:0%
looking into the family courts that this
 
01:08:52.749 --> 01:08:52.759 align:start position:0%
would obviously we've had
 
01:08:54.390 --> 01:08:54.400 align:start position:0%
recommendations Spur off off of it from
 
01:08:55.870 --> 01:08:55.880 align:start position:0%
domestic violence or anything else but
 
01:08:57.390 --> 01:08:57.400 align:start position:0%
this particular committee this would be
 
01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
our final these last two would be our
 
01:09:02.149 --> 01:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
final we could say that in the course of
 
01:09:04.789 --> 01:09:04.799 align:start position:0%
talking and listening a few other
 
01:09:07.510 --> 01:09:07.520 align:start position:0%
subjects came up but we think those
 
01:09:11.630 --> 01:09:11.640 align:start position:0%
should be addressed by other groups
 
01:09:13.630 --> 01:09:13.640 align:start position:0%
special committees subcommittees
 
01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:17.640 align:start position:0%
whatever but not by
 
01:09:21.229 --> 01:09:21.239 align:start position:0%
us yes okay I'm just clarifying what my
 
01:09:23.349 --> 01:09:23.359 align:start position:0%
notes were from the last time and that's
 
01:09:25.110 --> 01:09:25.120 align:start position:0%
why I'm was questioning or just
 
01:09:27.110 --> 01:09:27.120 align:start position:0%
clarifying that representative Smith
 
01:09:29.390 --> 01:09:29.400 align:start position:0%
clarified that we had another we had an
 
01:09:31.269 --> 01:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
additional year to continue the work on
 
01:09:33.590 --> 01:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
this process questioned how much is
 
01:09:36.110 --> 01:09:36.120 align:start position:0%
needed for the interim report keeping in
 
01:09:37.910 --> 01:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
mind that a full report will be due in
 
01:09:37.920 --> 01:09:38.990 align:start position:0%
mind that a full report will be due in
one

01:09:38.990 --> 01:09:39.000 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:09:42.789 --> 01:09:42.799 align:start position:0%
year that does not say we have to keep
 
01:09:46.309 --> 01:09:46.319 align:start position:0%
finding things to do until next November
 
01:09:49.110 --> 01:09:49.120 align:start position:0%
comes if we believe we are done with
 
01:09:52.829 --> 01:09:52.839 align:start position:0%
what we wish to do we are done and the
 
01:09:56.110 --> 01:09:56.120 align:start position:0%
final report come out in
 
01:09:58.790 --> 01:09:58.800 align:start position:0%
February there is no mandate to continue
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
for another
 
01:10:04.669 --> 01:10:04.679 align:start position:0%
year and if we do not think that we are
 
01:10:08.270 --> 01:10:08.280 align:start position:0%
the exact venue whereby these other
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
subjects such as DV should be considered
 
01:10:14.070 --> 01:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
we won't take that on we will just put
 
01:10:17.870 --> 01:10:17.880 align:start position:0%
a exhortation in our final report as to
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:22.640 --> 01:10:27.229 align:start position:0%
 
done

01:10:27.229 --> 01:10:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:30.709 --> 01:10:30.719 align:start position:0%
yeah okay are we done anything
 
01:10:38.510 --> 01:10:38.520 align:start position:0%
