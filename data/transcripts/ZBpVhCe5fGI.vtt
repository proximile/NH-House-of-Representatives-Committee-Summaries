00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 align:start position:0%
once he's done with you guys so if you
 
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:14.360 align:start position:0%
could start with Lottery that would be
 
00:07:16.029 --> 00:07:16.039 align:start position:0%

00:07:40.189 --> 00:07:40.199 align:start position:0%
time you gave us the
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
estimates good morning Mr chairman frog
 
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:45.400 align:start position:0%
in the throat um members of the
 
00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:47.080 align:start position:0%
committee uh Charlie McIntyre Hampshire
 
00:07:50.029 --> 00:07:50.039 align:start position:0%
lottery um I don't have any changes at
 
00:07:52.270 --> 00:07:52.280 align:start position:0%
this time I would tell you that the
 
00:07:54.589 --> 00:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
current estimate for this fiscal year
 
00:07:56.749 --> 00:07:56.759 align:start position:0%
would be on the more conservative side
 
00:08:00.869 --> 00:08:00.879 align:start position:0%
now than it had been previously so we
 
00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:05.479 align:start position:0%
anticipate excuse me talk about timing
 
00:08:07.790 --> 00:08:07.800 align:start position:0%
um it's possible in a month time we
 
00:08:10.350 --> 00:08:10.360 align:start position:0%
would raise guidance uh we had an
 
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:12.360 align:start position:0%
exceptional uh January which we
 
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:15.360 align:start position:0%
transferred into February um which
 
00:08:18.149 --> 00:08:18.159 align:start position:0%
raised our overall transfer number uh
 
00:08:22.029 --> 00:08:22.039 align:start position:0%
significantly I think we are 34% had a
 
00:08:27.510 --> 00:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
plan currently um but that is a
 
00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
statistically very High number compared
 
00:08:33.389 --> 00:08:33.399 align:start position:0%
to our comparators so I'm reluctant to
 
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:35.880 align:start position:0%
change the number only because we're
 
00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:38.039 align:start position:0%
such an outlier for the most for all of
 
00:08:39.509 --> 00:08:39.519 align:start position:0%
New England in terms of our Revenue
 
00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:42.959 align:start position:0%
growth so um I have no change now but
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
certainly it's possible it's more than
 
00:08:47.230 --> 00:08:47.240 align:start position:0%
possible is likely to raise Guidance the
 
00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:49.440 align:start position:0%
next next time is that
 
00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:55.440 align:start position:0%
34% I had a plan primarily due to the
 
00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:57.560 align:start position:0%
um the
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
lar jackpots that that we had earlier
 
00:09:00.839 --> 00:09:02.030 align:start position:0%
lar jackpots that that we had earlier
this

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680 align:start position:0%
year um it's certainly that did that
 
00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
didn't hurt that helped immensely um
 
00:09:12.509 --> 00:09:12.519 align:start position:0%
it's everything we're it's everything um
 
00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're seeing significant growth in
 
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:18.440 align:start position:0%
lottery tickets scratch ticket sales um
 
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
but it's not Statewide it's the entire
 
00:09:23.670 --> 00:09:23.680 align:start position:0%
state is up but there are Pockets that
 
00:09:26.030 --> 00:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
are up significantly more than others
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
like the Lakes Region for example is up
 
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.710 align:start position:0%
like the Lakes Region for example is up
significantly

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:29.720 align:start position:0%
significantly
 
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:31.480 align:start position:0%
um well above 30% in terms of scratch
 
00:09:34.269 --> 00:09:34.279 align:start position:0%
ticket sales uh and I'd imagine that's
 
00:09:37.389 --> 00:09:37.399 align:start position:0%
due to a number of citizens who are not
 
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:39.120 align:start position:0%
natural citizens of New Hampshire but
 
00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200 align:start position:0%
sort of um live here now because of
 
00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
covid and engage in activity that they
 
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
did in Massachusetts or Connecticut or
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
rhod Island up here so um like for
 
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:52.320 align:start position:0%
example our lowest region growth-wise is
 
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:56.720 align:start position:0%
SE Coast for for another the there's
 
00:09:58.350 --> 00:09:58.360 align:start position:0%
been not the same level of growth there
 
00:10:01.990 --> 00:10:02.000 align:start position:0%
has been Lakes Region so um that's the
 
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:04.160 align:start position:0%
answer I we're up everywhere Mr chairman
 
00:10:06.750 --> 00:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
so um it's you know it's good news it's
 
00:10:07.829 --> 00:10:07.839 align:start position:0%
just scary
 
00:10:14.430 --> 00:10:14.440 align:start position:0%
news okay then uh the plan was 110.4 for
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
fy21 yes last mentioned that you
 
00:10:21.670 --> 00:10:21.680 align:start position:0%
expected it would come in at
 
00:10:26.350 --> 00:10:26.360 align:start position:0%
12.6 yes are you still holding with that
 
00:10:28.389 --> 00:10:28.399 align:start position:0%
yes and that actually would now be on
 
00:10:30.230 --> 00:10:30.240 align:start position:0%
the more conservative side of our
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
estimates so um I'm more than
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
comfortable giving that number sir and
 
00:10:40.389 --> 00:10:40.399 align:start position:0%
then U the same way with fy22 and 23
 
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
holding at 125 for
 
00:10:51.190 --> 00:10:51.200 align:start position:0%
22 yes 27.5 for 23 that's correct okay
 
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:56.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:59.750 --> 00:10:59.760 align:start position:0%
committee represent elme
 
00:11:04.629 --> 00:11:04.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman uh Charlie if this
 
00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:08.720 align:start position:0%
is mostly due to Outsiders that are
 
00:11:12.509 --> 00:11:12.519 align:start position:0%
living among us and likely to go back
 
00:11:14.190 --> 00:11:14.200 align:start position:0%
isn't it likely they're still going to
 
00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
be here through June
 
00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240 align:start position:0%
and without touching 22 and 23 maybe we
 
00:11:24.069 --> 00:11:24.079 align:start position:0%
ought to be increasing
 
00:11:28.470 --> 00:11:28.480 align:start position:0%
21 thank you I mean certainly the when I
 
00:11:30.829 --> 00:11:30.839 align:start position:0%
was visiting with you folks last time
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
that took into account the large growth
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
we would experien in January because we
 
00:11:36.870 --> 00:11:36.880 align:start position:0%
transfer a month behind us you know
 
00:11:39.949 --> 00:11:39.959 align:start position:0%
representative Aly
 
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:44.360 align:start position:0%
um I I'm certainly reluctant to raise
 
00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:47.120 align:start position:0%
guidance off of a single event which is
 
00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:48.880 align:start position:0%
historically never been
 
00:11:48.880 --> 00:11:50.629 align:start position:0%
historically never been
duplicated

00:11:50.629 --> 00:11:50.639 align:start position:0%
duplicated
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
um I don't want to overpromise and
 
00:11:55.949 --> 00:11:55.959 align:start position:0%
underperform as you can imagine um so I
 
00:11:58.389 --> 00:11:58.399 align:start position:0%
would imagine certainly I would believe
 
00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
that would be the case that these folks
 
00:12:02.870 --> 00:12:02.880 align:start position:0%
would still still be here in June um
 
00:12:04.949 --> 00:12:04.959 align:start position:0%
it's not all of the growth it's a it's a
 
00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:08.760 align:start position:0%
it's a large portion of it um but I I
 
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:15.949 --> 00:12:15.959 align:start position:0%
it okay representative Ames followed by
 
00:12:15.959 --> 00:12:20.310 align:start position:0%
it okay representative Ames followed by
representative

00:12:20.310 --> 00:12:20.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:24.160 align:start position:0%
abonne representative Ames you're
 
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:27.560 align:start position:0%
muted I think uh representative bramy
 
00:12:30.949 --> 00:12:30.959 align:start position:0%
was ahead of me but if this is the way
 
00:12:33.189 --> 00:12:33.199 align:start position:0%
you want to go that's fine I may be I
 
00:12:35.189 --> 00:12:35.199 align:start position:0%
may be asking your question so why don't
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
you go first and I'll okay we we'll see
 
00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:43.720 align:start position:0%
H okay um yeah this is uh and uh Mr
 
00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:45.110 align:start position:0%
H okay um yeah this is uh and uh Mr
chair

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:45.120 align:start position:0%
chair
 
00:12:48.710 --> 00:12:48.720 align:start position:0%
I tell me if this is out of order but uh
 
00:12:51.230 --> 00:12:51.240 align:start position:0%
this is a question related to House Bill
 
00:12:54.829 --> 00:12:54.839 align:start position:0%
two and thear horse racing
 
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:02.040 align:start position:0%
gaming um new Beyond current law Revenue
 
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:04.440 align:start position:0%
estimate that that would be because
 
00:13:06.629 --> 00:13:06.639 align:start position:0%
we're just dealing with current law then
 
00:13:09.629 --> 00:13:09.639 align:start position:0%
when once we go into Hill to we can deal
 
00:13:11.629 --> 00:13:11.639 align:start position:0%
with that
 
00:13:14.069 --> 00:13:14.079 align:start position:0%
great although although Charlie won't be
 
00:13:15.750 --> 00:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
with us he's the one who can answer the
 
00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:17.110 align:start position:0%
with us he's the one who can answer the
question

00:13:17.110 --> 00:13:17.120 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:13:22.230 --> 00:13:22.240 align:start position:0%
norm since Charlie be a to view of us um
 
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:26.000 align:start position:0%
and go ahead ask question okay thank you
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
representative Ry um
 
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:34.000 align:start position:0%
in your um so I'm I'm asking about the
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
historic ra racing gaming estimate of
 
00:13:43.350 --> 00:13:43.360 align:start position:0%
Revenue that um is um likely to appear
 
00:13:45.790 --> 00:13:45.800 align:start position:0%
in House Bill 2 apparently the value
 
00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:48.560 align:start position:0%
finance committee is considering
 
00:13:51.829 --> 00:13:51.839 align:start position:0%
inserting this bill
 
00:13:56.829 --> 00:13:56.839 align:start position:0%
into house bill two and uh the revenue
 
00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:01.320 align:start position:0%
that it brings um so uh the estimate
 
00:14:03.230 --> 00:14:03.240 align:start position:0%
that you have your fiscal note I think
 
00:14:07.110 --> 00:14:07.120 align:start position:0%
you prepared it um becomes critical um
 
00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:11.160 align:start position:0%
we need to be sure it's right and uh the
 
00:14:15.389 --> 00:14:15.399 align:start position:0%
estimate that is being carried
 
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:20.320 align:start position:0%
is is basically your estimate I believe
 
00:14:23.069 --> 00:14:23.079 align:start position:0%
128 or 12.9
 
00:14:26.509 --> 00:14:26.519 align:start position:0%
million and that would be in fiscal year
 
00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
23 um and looking at that fiscal note
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
that the company HP
 
00:14:36.030 --> 00:14:36.040 align:start position:0%
626 which is the form in which we've
 
00:14:41.389 --> 00:14:41.399 align:start position:0%
looked at it um you assumed uh
 
00:14:46.310 --> 00:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
16 locations and uh and an expected
 
00:14:49.509 --> 00:14:49.519 align:start position:0%
daily handle per terminal and a certain
 
00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:50.720 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:14:54.269 --> 00:14:54.279 align:start position:0%
Terminals and then you did a calculation
 
00:14:57.829 --> 00:14:57.839 align:start position:0%
that gave you the total gross revenue
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
called handle the total total handle for
 
00:15:06.910 --> 00:15:06.920 align:start position:0%
the year and then you took
 
00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:10.120 align:start position:0%
12% of that as the
 
00:15:14.189 --> 00:15:14.199 align:start position:0%
takeout and then move from the
 
00:15:18.590 --> 00:15:18.600 align:start position:0%
takeout to um the distribution amongst
 
00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:19.350 align:start position:0%
takeout to um the distribution amongst
the

00:15:19.350 --> 00:15:19.360 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:15:22.949 --> 00:15:22.959 align:start position:0%
various um places that the money goes to
 
00:15:24.949 --> 00:15:24.959 align:start position:0%
one of them being to the
 
00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
state um the 12% that you used is the
 
00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:34.279 align:start position:0%
maximum commission Allowed by house
 
00:15:37.189 --> 00:15:37.199 align:start position:0%
build 626 and presumably by the what
 
00:15:38.910 --> 00:15:38.920 align:start position:0%
will be in house build
 
00:15:46.749 --> 00:15:46.759 align:start position:0%
2 um and uh so um my question to you is
 
00:15:49.550 --> 00:15:49.560 align:start position:0%
why did you use that
 
00:15:54.509 --> 00:15:54.519 align:start position:0%
12% um we know from testimony that uh
 
00:15:56.910 --> 00:15:56.920 align:start position:0%
the other states that do historic
 
00:15:59.829 --> 00:15:59.839 align:start position:0%
racing um
 
00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
gaming are
 
00:16:06.030 --> 00:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
more have a takeout that's more like 8%
 
00:16:08.470 --> 00:16:08.480 align:start position:0%
Wyoming I just looked at Wyoming it's
 
00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.389 align:start position:0%
Wyoming I just looked at Wyoming it's
about

00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:16:14.150 --> 00:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
7.65% and um if you use that as your
 
00:16:15.870 --> 00:16:15.880 align:start position:0%
starting point of course you get a lower
 
00:16:19.269 --> 00:16:19.279 align:start position:0%
number for the distributions and I
 
00:16:22.509 --> 00:16:22.519 align:start position:0%
understand uh from discussions we had
 
00:16:26.670 --> 00:16:26.680 align:start position:0%
yesterday that you think uh with a a
 
00:16:29.230 --> 00:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
lower takeout that there would be more
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
gaming activity so that the gross would
 
00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:35.040 align:start position:0%
be higher and so it would all work out
 
00:16:38.269 --> 00:16:38.279 align:start position:0%
but that's a pretty big jump uh of
 
00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:42.720 align:start position:0%
gaming activity in order to to U come
 
00:16:45.590 --> 00:16:45.600 align:start position:0%
out at the same point so that's the
 
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:48.480 align:start position:0%
that's my question I we need to get this
 
00:16:52.629 --> 00:16:52.639 align:start position:0%
right and uh um i' like your response to
 
00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:54.670 align:start position:0%
right and uh um i' like your response to
all

00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:54.680 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:16:57.069 --> 00:16:57.079 align:start position:0%
that certainly uh thank you for the
 
00:16:59.509 --> 00:16:59.519 align:start position:0%
question representative Ames uh
 
00:17:01.949 --> 00:17:01.959 align:start position:0%
um when you think about gambling it's
 
00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:04.760 align:start position:0%
not a typical product obviously it's not
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
like you bought a candy bar at a
 
00:17:08.150 --> 00:17:08.160 align:start position:0%
community store or a piece of clothing
 
00:17:11.990 --> 00:17:12.000 align:start position:0%
at a retail shop where it costs so much
 
00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:15.640 align:start position:0%
to make it costs so much to sell and
 
00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:19.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.319 --> 00:17:21.029 align:start position:0%
 
margin

00:17:21.029 --> 00:17:21.039 align:start position:0%
margin
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
the the handle is really just activity
 
00:17:26.470 --> 00:17:26.480 align:start position:0%
it's not gross revenue and I I know this
 
00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:29.480 align:start position:0%
hard to explain but represent name say
 
00:17:31.350 --> 00:17:31.360 align:start position:0%
for example you and I play poker and I
 
00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:33.240 align:start position:0%
have $100 and you have $100 we sit at
 
00:17:35.430 --> 00:17:35.440 align:start position:0%
the table for two hours and play poker
 
00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:37.400 align:start position:0%
back and forth heads up which means we
 
00:17:39.789 --> 00:17:39.799 align:start position:0%
play back and forth against each other
 
00:17:41.870 --> 00:17:41.880 align:start position:0%
we will probably have a handle somewhere
 
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:43.760 align:start position:0%
around two or three
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
thousand because the bets the place I
 
00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:49.520 align:start position:0%
bet $20 you bet $20 you win you bet $20
 
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:53.080 align:start position:0%
I bet $20 I win so the handle is just a
 
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:55.360 align:start position:0%
very large number that gauges activity
 
00:17:57.070 --> 00:17:57.080 align:start position:0%
the the main number is What's the total
 
00:17:59.710 --> 00:17:59.720 align:start position:0%
commission obviously or what we we what
 
00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:01.600 align:start position:0%
we characterize in the business as gross
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
Gaming revenue
 
00:18:07.190 --> 00:18:07.200 align:start position:0%
ggr and I know this is going to sound
 
00:18:09.549 --> 00:18:09.559 align:start position:0%
counterintuitive but oddly the lower the
 
00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:11.400 align:start position:0%
number related to percentage of
 
00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:13.960 align:start position:0%
commission the higher the net
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
profitability for
 
00:18:21.430 --> 00:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
gambling for example the highest payout
 
00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400 align:start position:0%
state in the US per capita for lottery
 
00:18:25.630 --> 00:18:25.640 align:start position:0%
tickets is
 
00:18:27.789 --> 00:18:27.799 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts they are also the number
 
00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:29.240 align:start position:0%
one state
 
00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:32.200 align:start position:0%
in net Gaming revenue per capita in the
 
00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.830 align:start position:0%
in net Gaming revenue per capita in the
Free

00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:34.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.630 align:start position:0%
 
World

00:18:36.630 --> 00:18:36.640 align:start position:0%
World
 
00:18:39.270 --> 00:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
so what you're doing is you are creating
 
00:18:40.510 --> 00:18:40.520 align:start position:0%
it it's
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
it's it's the experience it's the I want
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
I lost I want it lost I want it lost
 
00:18:49.029 --> 00:18:49.039 align:start position:0%
you've created a lot of activity and and
 
00:18:50.669 --> 00:18:50.679 align:start position:0%
you've increased the amount
 
00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
of net revenue and I'll give you another
 
00:18:55.590 --> 00:18:55.600 align:start position:0%
example New Hampshire we have raised the
 
00:18:57.909 --> 00:18:57.919 align:start position:0%
prize payout significantly since I
 
00:19:00.909 --> 00:19:00.919 align:start position:0%
arrived here 11 years
 
00:19:03.590 --> 00:19:03.600 align:start position:0%
ago and sort of logic if you were a
 
00:19:04.789 --> 00:19:04.799 align:start position:0%
normal business would you would you
 
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720 align:start position:0%
would think well if we raise prize
 
00:19:08.549 --> 00:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
payout that means we get less of the pie
 
00:19:12.029 --> 00:19:12.039 align:start position:0%
no we we grew the pie a lot uh our first
 
00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:13.520 align:start position:0%
year our first year here net revenues
 
00:19:15.230 --> 00:19:15.240 align:start position:0%
and scratch tickets I think were 35
 
00:19:17.310 --> 00:19:17.320 align:start position:0%
million whereas this year they're
 
00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:20.400 align:start position:0%
estimated to be$ 53 million
 
00:19:22.990 --> 00:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
so um I don't changeed it at all
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
candidly I would probably raise it if
 
00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:27.120 align:start position:0%
anything representative Apes if if the
 
00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:28.840 align:start position:0%
payout is where it's
 
00:19:32.830 --> 00:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
9% um I would certainly think that those
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
folks knew what they were doing and
 
00:19:37.549 --> 00:19:37.559 align:start position:0%
probably raise guidance on it um and I
 
00:19:39.669 --> 00:19:39.679 align:start position:0%
would sort of remind the committee that
 
00:19:41.470 --> 00:19:41.480 align:start position:0%
we have been pretty good about Revenue
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
estimates in the past as to all other G
 
00:19:46.310 --> 00:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
forms of gambling um you know I don't
 
00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:48.080 align:start position:0%
say we've never been off but we usually
 
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:59.470 --> 00:19:59.480 align:start position:0%
gambling are you all set representes
 
00:20:01.750 --> 00:20:01.760 align:start position:0%
well I I guess I'm gonna just go a
 
00:20:04.870 --> 00:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
little further I you know you're the
 
00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:09.520 align:start position:0%
expert Charlie and I bow to that um and
 
00:20:11.110 --> 00:20:11.120 align:start position:0%
uh yet in
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%
your huh wish you tell my wife that yeah
 
00:20:17.710 --> 00:20:17.720 align:start position:0%
right we
 
00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:22.760 align:start position:0%
can well we could go on about that um so
 
00:20:24.470 --> 00:20:24.480 align:start position:0%
um when you did your
 
00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:26.520 align:start position:0%
estimate you did
 
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:30.280 align:start position:0%
use a total of expect expected
 
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:32.110 align:start position:0%
use a total of expect expected
handle

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.120 align:start position:0%
handle
 
00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:38.080 align:start position:0%
um and you did that based on a number uh
 
00:20:43.149 --> 00:20:43.159 align:start position:0%
per terminal and this is how uh Wyoming
 
00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:46.240 align:start position:0%
calculates their total handle too I mean
 
00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:47.360 align:start position:0%
there's his
 
00:20:53.310 --> 00:20:53.320 align:start position:0%
actual um Y and that uh that takes into
 
00:20:55.750 --> 00:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
account I have to assume all the churn
 
00:20:57.110 --> 00:20:57.120 align:start position:0%
that you
 
00:21:01.669 --> 00:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
described um and then with that number
 
00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:04.840 align:start position:0%
you took 12% of it and went on through
 
00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:07.640 align:start position:0%
the calculation so you know for me
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
looking at
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
this it sure looks like uh the um handle
 
00:21:16.070 --> 00:21:16.080 align:start position:0%
from the gaming
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
machine will be
 
00:21:22.950 --> 00:21:22.960 align:start position:0%
um in that order of magnitude and I do
 
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:26.480 align:start position:0%
understand the the suggestion that uh if
 
00:21:29.990 --> 00:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
uh there's more to be taken can not more
 
00:21:33.350 --> 00:21:33.360 align:start position:0%
to be kept by the players so less of a
 
00:21:36.950 --> 00:21:36.960 align:start position:0%
hand handle a share that the might be
 
00:21:40.430 --> 00:21:40.440 align:start position:0%
more activity I can understand that but
 
00:21:44.669 --> 00:21:44.679 align:start position:0%
essentially uh I have to using this mode
 
00:21:46.909 --> 00:21:46.919 align:start position:0%
of analysis that you've given us I have
 
00:21:49.029 --> 00:21:49.039 align:start position:0%
to assume that the gambling level will
 
00:21:51.350 --> 00:21:51.360 align:start position:0%
go up by
 
00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:52.950 align:start position:0%
go up by
um

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:52.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:52.960 --> 00:21:56.110 align:start position:0%
um
133%

00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:56.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:58.630 --> 00:21:58.640 align:start position:0%
basically so is
 
00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:02.000 align:start position:0%
your question is yeah so I I I'd just
 
00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
like the director to respond to
 
00:22:07.630 --> 00:22:07.640 align:start position:0%
that I mean certainly to your question
 
00:22:09.430 --> 00:22:09.440 align:start position:0%
um representative Ames the handle is not
 
00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:13.320 align:start position:0%
a fixed number this isn't a question of
 
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:16.480 align:start position:0%
um like I said a a fixed product a
 
00:22:19.269 --> 00:22:19.279 align:start position:0%
widget which you buy over store um
 
00:22:21.870 --> 00:22:21.880 align:start position:0%
handle is a factor of a number of things
 
00:22:24.669 --> 00:22:24.679 align:start position:0%
one of which is payout like for example
 
00:22:28.029 --> 00:22:28.039 align:start position:0%
if this loss we write the fiscal notes
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
to correspond with what we know is to be
 
00:22:32.789 --> 00:22:32.799 align:start position:0%
in the law we don't want to factor in
 
00:22:36.029 --> 00:22:36.039 align:start position:0%
what may or may not occur in the field
 
00:22:38.269 --> 00:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
because they'll it'll never be a fixed
 
00:22:41.029 --> 00:22:41.039 align:start position:0%
number in the field the payout will vary
 
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:43.360 align:start position:0%
day by day week by week because some
 
00:22:45.789 --> 00:22:45.799 align:start position:0%
folks win more on certain days than
 
00:22:49.870 --> 00:22:49.880 align:start position:0%
other days um so if we were to change
 
00:22:52.870 --> 00:22:52.880 align:start position:0%
the hand U handle percentage or the if
 
00:22:58.990 --> 00:22:59.000 align:start position:0%
it was 85% we would write to 80 to 15%
 
00:23:00.390 --> 00:23:00.400 align:start position:0%
because we know that's the fixed number
 
00:23:03.390 --> 00:23:03.400 align:start position:0%
in the law versus what we would probably
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
know to be the industry standard in
 
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:08.440 align:start position:0%
terms of payout for the machines um and
 
00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.080 align:start position:0%
I would estimate there somewhere around
 
00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:11.269 align:start position:0%
I would estimate there somewhere around
90

00:23:11.269 --> 00:23:11.279 align:start position:0%
90
 
00:23:14.269 --> 00:23:14.279 align:start position:0%
91% varying by machine and by location
 
00:23:16.549 --> 00:23:16.559 align:start position:0%
on the floor but that's the person who
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
know whose job it is to to dictate where
 
00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:22.360 align:start position:0%
those go um like I said I I would
 
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:23.600 align:start position:0%
suggest to you that this is a
 
00:23:27.630 --> 00:23:27.640 align:start position:0%
conservative estimate 12.8 million um
 
00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.510 align:start position:0%
conservative estimate 12.8 million um
and

00:23:28.510 --> 00:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:23:30.350 --> 00:23:30.360 align:start position:0%
certainly hearken to our folks in
 
00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:32.640 align:start position:0%
Wyoming but I don't use their revenue
 
00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:35.400 align:start position:0%
estimates as a comparator only because
 
00:23:37.789 --> 00:23:37.799 align:start position:0%
it's such a
 
00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:40.799 align:start position:0%
desperate State the population density
 
00:23:43.269 --> 00:23:43.279 align:start position:0%
in Wyoming is a fraction of what it is
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
here and therefore the activity is a
 
00:23:50.029 --> 00:23:50.039 align:start position:0%
fraction um I would you know Wyoming is
 
00:23:52.549 --> 00:23:52.559 align:start position:0%
what bigger than New England I think um
 
00:23:54.870 --> 00:23:54.880 align:start position:0%
I would expect a large number of folks
 
00:23:56.710 --> 00:23:56.720 align:start position:0%
to be from Massachusetts who play this
 
00:23:58.750 --> 00:23:58.760 align:start position:0%
who who do historic racing in New
 
00:24:01.710 --> 00:24:01.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I count on those customers
 
00:24:03.390 --> 00:24:03.400 align:start position:0%
to a large
 
00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
extent okay this okay I think we've
 
00:24:07.029 --> 00:24:07.039 align:start position:0%
taken it far enough so thank you very
 
00:24:09.950 --> 00:24:09.960 align:start position:0%
much this discussion has to do house
 
00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:15.120 align:start position:0%
build to changes due to Historic racing
 
00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:16.990 align:start position:0%
build to changes due to Historic racing
representative

00:24:16.990 --> 00:24:17.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:20.600 align:start position:0%
Bry yeah I just we're we're we're using
 
00:24:23.789 --> 00:24:23.799 align:start position:0%
20 uh 12 million and then we're using
 
00:24:28.149 --> 00:24:28.159 align:start position:0%
12.9 million the difference I've gone
 
00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:32.080 align:start position:0%
with the 12 million figure because about
 
00:24:35.110 --> 00:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
089 of that is the breakage which goes
 
00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:38.520 align:start position:0%
to problem gambling I guess the question
 
00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:39.350 align:start position:0%
to problem gambling I guess the question
for

00:24:39.350 --> 00:24:39.360 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:42.590 --> 00:24:42.600 align:start position:0%
Charlie I never asked you this is there
 
00:24:44.630 --> 00:24:44.640 align:start position:0%
indeed a special Fund in which that
 
00:24:47.669 --> 00:24:47.679 align:start position:0%
money would go to for problem gambling
 
00:24:50.029 --> 00:24:50.039 align:start position:0%
or is that just become part of your
 
00:24:51.470 --> 00:24:51.480 align:start position:0%
budget or does the money go to the
 
00:24:54.470 --> 00:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
general fund um the Council on problem
 
00:24:57.350 --> 00:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
gaming is administ administratively tied
 
00:24:58.269 --> 00:24:58.279 align:start position:0%
to us
 
00:25:00.110 --> 00:25:00.120 align:start position:0%
but they don't work for us like they
 
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:02.360 align:start position:0%
they don't work for me we just help them
 
00:25:04.549 --> 00:25:04.559 align:start position:0%
with administrative functions like
 
00:25:08.669 --> 00:25:08.679 align:start position:0%
accounting like GNC matters and the like
 
00:25:11.070 --> 00:25:11.080 align:start position:0%
um so it would be a essentially a line
 
00:25:12.750 --> 00:25:12.760 align:start position:0%
item boost to
 
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:17.240 align:start position:0%
their accounting unit number right so
 
00:25:19.190 --> 00:25:19.200 align:start position:0%
from which it's is derived from our
 
00:25:21.350 --> 00:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
budget like our budget I think is
 
00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:23.559 align:start position:0%
$100,000 goes to them it comes from off
 
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:26.240 align:start position:0%
of our line so all that money would go
 
00:25:28.789 --> 00:25:28.799 align:start position:0%
to the state but it would go to them
 
00:25:30.110 --> 00:25:30.120 align:start position:0%
right it wouldn't it wouldn't have wind
 
00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080 align:start position:0%
up in the education trust fund is my
 
00:25:34.470 --> 00:25:34.480 align:start position:0%
point AB no that it's possible it would
 
00:25:36.590 --> 00:25:36.600 align:start position:0%
if they didn't spend it so every year if
 
00:25:38.590 --> 00:25:38.600 align:start position:0%
you so in past years they haven't spent
 
00:25:40.630 --> 00:25:40.640 align:start position:0%
their allocated budget it revers to the
 
00:25:42.470 --> 00:25:42.480 align:start position:0%
bottom line and got transferred to
 
00:25:44.430 --> 00:25:44.440 align:start position:0%
education trust fund Ju Just for the
 
00:25:46.110 --> 00:25:46.120 align:start position:0%
committee I've I've always used the 12
 
00:25:49.029 --> 00:25:49.039 align:start position:0%
million assuming that that most of that
 
00:25:51.630 --> 00:25:51.640 align:start position:0%
would wind up uh going to the that to
 
00:25:55.190 --> 00:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
that other fund so uh again it's the
 
00:25:56.990 --> 00:25:57.000 align:start position:0%
breakage that goes there and it's about
 
00:26:01.950 --> 00:26:01.960 align:start position:0%
point point8 uh about 821 th000 uh so
 
00:26:03.990 --> 00:26:04.000 align:start position:0%
instead of using the 12.9 that's going
 
00:26:07.710 --> 00:26:07.720 align:start position:0%
to go to education trust I've I've I've
 
00:26:09.470 --> 00:26:09.480 align:start position:0%
I've again used the conservative number
 
00:26:11.870 --> 00:26:11.880 align:start position:0%
of of the 12 million I just want every
 
00:26:13.590 --> 00:26:13.600 align:start position:0%
understand and again the discussion is
 
00:26:15.110 --> 00:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
on historic
 
00:26:18.070 --> 00:26:18.080 align:start position:0%
racing which is part of house build
 
00:26:21.070 --> 00:26:21.080 align:start position:0%
too all set representative yeah I'm set
 
00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:22.240 align:start position:0%
just want to know I just wanted to point
 
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:24.080 align:start position:0%
that out and thank you for clarifying
 
00:26:27.230 --> 00:26:27.240 align:start position:0%
that for me Charlie of course of course
 
00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.830 align:start position:0%
that for me Charlie of course of course
represent

00:26:28.830 --> 00:26:28.840 align:start position:0%
represent
 
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:32.720 align:start position:0%
again thank you Mr chairman um Mr
 
00:26:35.230 --> 00:26:35.240 align:start position:0%
McIntyre my question is you may or may
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
not know the answer to this it may or
 
00:26:39.830 --> 00:26:39.840 align:start position:0%
may not be something that you track um
 
00:26:43.430 --> 00:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if uh when stimulus checks
 
00:26:45.950 --> 00:26:45.960 align:start position:0%
as stimulus checks come out I heard on
 
00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:49.200 align:start position:0%
the news the other day that 25% of young
 
00:26:50.590 --> 00:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
people were spending their stimulus
 
00:26:54.310 --> 00:26:54.320 align:start position:0%
checks on um the stock market and I'm
 
00:26:55.950 --> 00:26:55.960 align:start position:0%
just wondering there's probably a
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
certain percentage of people that will
 
00:26:59.789 --> 00:26:59.799 align:start position:0%
spend their stimulus checks on on the
 
00:27:01.830 --> 00:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
lottery um was that anything where you
 
00:27:03.710 --> 00:27:03.720 align:start position:0%
saw a bump last time stimulus checks
 
00:27:05.430 --> 00:27:05.440 align:start position:0%
went out and whether you expect any sort
 
00:27:07.750 --> 00:27:07.760 align:start position:0%
of bump this time along with larger
 
00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.149 align:start position:0%
of bump this time along with larger
stimulus

00:27:09.149 --> 00:27:09.159 align:start position:0%
stimulus
 
00:27:12.870 --> 00:27:12.880 align:start position:0%
checks I I certainly we saw a large bump
 
00:27:15.789 --> 00:27:15.799 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't so um we saw a large bump
 
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
just globally and it's been staying
 
00:27:19.870 --> 00:27:19.880 align:start position:0%
there so there hasn't been a time where
 
00:27:21.070 --> 00:27:21.080 align:start position:0%
we've noticed an
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
uptick to a specific event um other than
 
00:27:27.710 --> 00:27:27.720 align:start position:0%
a large jackpot which is our Norm so the
 
00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559 align:start position:0%
answer is no I haven't seen it um like
 
00:27:32.350 --> 00:27:32.360 align:start position:0%
that like like like you I understand
 
00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:33.720 align:start position:0%
your question to be asking I haven't
 
00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:34.470 align:start position:0%
your question to be asking I haven't
seen

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:34.480 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:27:36.549 --> 00:27:36.559 align:start position:0%
it okay thank
 
00:27:39.669 --> 00:27:39.679 align:start position:0%
you representative
 
00:27:45.549 --> 00:27:45.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
muted thank you Mr chairman Mr McIntyre
 
00:27:52.509 --> 00:27:52.519 align:start position:0%
it is my opinion that the reasons uh
 
00:27:55.630 --> 00:27:55.640 align:start position:0%
that the revenues have been increased is
 
00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:57.760 align:start position:0%
because of the fact that we're when
 
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:00.840 align:start position:0%
people are confined for 24 hours uh they
 
00:28:02.310 --> 00:28:02.320 align:start position:0%
tend to gamble
 
00:28:05.830 --> 00:28:05.840 align:start position:0%
more uh do my question is do you and
 
00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:11.320 align:start position:0%
when the uh Corona uh event uh is
 
00:28:14.470 --> 00:28:14.480 align:start position:0%
solved uh I believe that the uh Revenue
 
00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:17.720 align:start position:0%
will decrease do you agree with that
 
00:28:20.509 --> 00:28:20.519 align:start position:0%
statement I certainly the agree with you
 
00:28:21.630 --> 00:28:21.640 align:start position:0%
the first part of your statement
 
00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760 align:start position:0%
representative Elliot thanks for the
 
00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:25.640 align:start position:0%
question um I believe the first part
 
00:28:27.509 --> 00:28:27.519 align:start position:0%
relates to not having as many
 
00:28:29.509 --> 00:28:29.519 align:start position:0%
entertainment opportunities or options
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
as had previously been but I don't know
 
00:28:34.789 --> 00:28:34.799 align:start position:0%
we'll see a decrease I was as my Revenue
 
00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:36.720 align:start position:0%
estimate suggest I think you'll see a
 
00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.110 align:start position:0%
estimate suggest I think you'll see a
flattening

00:28:38.110 --> 00:28:38.120 align:start position:0%
flattening
 
00:28:41.070 --> 00:28:41.080 align:start position:0%
out um rather than a decrease like for
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
example you know we're so well
 
00:28:46.070 --> 00:28:46.080 align:start position:0%
Diversified down what we do I would
 
00:28:48.070 --> 00:28:48.080 align:start position:0%
anticipate sports betting to continue to
 
00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:51.880 align:start position:0%
grow dramatically annually and that will
 
00:28:53.710 --> 00:28:53.720 align:start position:0%
more to make up for any loss we may or
 
00:28:55.669 --> 00:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
may not have on on one of the other
 
00:28:58.190 --> 00:28:58.200 align:start position:0%
products we sell so I don't think our
 
00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:00.320 align:start position:0%
overall revenues would increase
 
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:04.440 align:start position:0%
sir thank you for your hopeful
 
00:29:07.029 --> 00:29:07.039 align:start position:0%
statement any further questions of
 
00:29:12.190 --> 00:29:12.200 align:start position:0%
Charlie on the revenues for 20 one two
 
00:29:15.190 --> 00:29:15.200 align:start position:0%
and three can I ask one I have my hand
 
00:29:20.389 --> 00:29:20.399 align:start position:0%
up I represent uh BR uh Charlie um
 
00:29:23.509 --> 00:29:23.519 align:start position:0%
Sports ping has been going very well um
 
00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:27.000 align:start position:0%
any any any reports coming out of Maine
 
00:29:30.149 --> 00:29:30.159 align:start position:0%
or Massachusetts about their them moving
 
00:29:31.909 --> 00:29:31.919 align:start position:0%
forward with sports Benning as
 
00:29:34.149 --> 00:29:34.159 align:start position:0%
well I hear more activity from
 
00:29:35.430 --> 00:29:35.440 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and thank you for the
 
00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:37.640 align:start position:0%
question there I think they
 
00:29:40.029 --> 00:29:40.039 align:start position:0%
filed I lost track I think at 14
 
00:29:42.070 --> 00:29:42.080 align:start position:0%
separate bills filed for sports betting
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
in Massachusetts um which seems like a
 
00:29:47.230 --> 00:29:47.240 align:start position:0%
lot to me um but they're trying to
 
00:29:48.990 --> 00:29:49.000 align:start position:0%
decide who does what I would imagine
 
00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:50.519 align:start position:0%
there'll be a version that comes out
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
that goes to the mass gaming commission
 
00:29:56.230 --> 00:29:56.240 align:start position:0%
at some point um but I would anticipate
 
00:29:58.590 --> 00:29:58.600 align:start position:0%
that probably taking through the fall
 
00:30:01.669 --> 00:30:01.679 align:start position:0%
and really being next winner question um
 
00:30:04.710 --> 00:30:04.720 align:start position:0%
but certainly it is an issue the vast
 
00:30:06.870 --> 00:30:06.880 align:start position:0%
majority of our revenues on the mobile
 
00:30:08.789 --> 00:30:08.799 align:start position:0%
side uh internet side come from New
 
00:30:10.710 --> 00:30:10.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire so I'm not as concerned as I
 
00:30:13.310 --> 00:30:13.320 align:start position:0%
would be um plus we have the benefit of
 
00:30:15.870 --> 00:30:15.880 align:start position:0%
not having an income tax where Mass
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
actually hits uh you for six% of your
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
winnings in Mass so that gives us an
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
sort of a marketing Advantage as it were
 
00:30:25.870 --> 00:30:25.880 align:start position:0%
uh you come here you're not going to get
 
00:30:27.950 --> 00:30:27.960 align:start position:0%
tax from that funny state tax I mean you
 
00:30:29.389 --> 00:30:29.399 align:start position:0%
obviously owe it back in Mass but that's
 
00:30:32.070 --> 00:30:32.080 align:start position:0%
on you not us so
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
um yes mass is an issue but I haven't
 
00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:38.360 align:start position:0%
noticed it yet bubbling its ugly head
 
00:30:39.789 --> 00:30:39.799 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:30:42.269 --> 00:30:42.279 align:start position:0%
Charlie all right
 
00:30:45.789 --> 00:30:45.799 align:start position:0%
um since you won't be with uh with us
 
00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:49.320 align:start position:0%
this afternoon on historic racing your
 
00:30:55.950 --> 00:30:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:58.950 --> 00:30:58.960 align:start position:0%
23 say Tak into consideration what goes
 
00:31:01.149 --> 00:31:01.159 align:start position:0%
to the problem
 
00:31:04.509 --> 00:31:04.519 align:start position:0%
gam yes certainly um the estimates would
 
00:31:08.909 --> 00:31:08.919 align:start position:0%
be um full year running would be 12
 
00:31:12.269 --> 00:31:12.279 align:start position:0%
million um and it would take us several
 
00:31:13.750 --> 00:31:13.760 align:start position:0%
months to get up in running so you're
 
00:31:15.789 --> 00:31:15.799 align:start position:0%
probably looking at
 
00:31:20.710 --> 00:31:20.720 align:start position:0%
fy22 06 million profitability first year
 
00:31:25.629 --> 00:31:25.639 align:start position:0%
because with fy22 and 12 million FY 23
 
00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:27.399 align:start position:0%
yes it'll so it'll take us a while go
 
00:31:29.509 --> 00:31:29.519 align:start position:0%
through R making uh and then obviously
 
00:31:32.190 --> 00:31:32.200 align:start position:0%
licensing will happen at the same time
 
00:31:34.029 --> 00:31:34.039 align:start position:0%
um and so that I would estimate that to
 
00:31:36.430 --> 00:31:36.440 align:start position:0%
be six-month period it it'll vary by a
 
00:31:39.990 --> 00:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
month or so but I um we've been real
 
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:41.960 align:start position:0%
good about getting Folks up and running
 
00:31:44.750 --> 00:31:44.760 align:start position:0%
in terms of speed uh we launch sports
 
00:31:46.750 --> 00:31:46.760 align:start position:0%
betting in 35 days which is the fastest
 
00:31:50.070 --> 00:31:50.080 align:start position:0%
in the US history I think um so uh we
 
00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:52.360 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll expedite the process do it
 
00:31:54.750 --> 00:31:54.760 align:start position:0%
thorough but it'll be I'd estimate that
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
to be the time
 
00:31:56.159 --> 00:31:58.149 align:start position:0%
to be the time
period

00:31:58.149 --> 00:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
period
 
00:32:00.950 --> 00:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
okay um saying no other questions thank
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%

committee represent major this is Chris
 
00:33:23.950 --> 00:33:23.960 align:start position:0%
I believe that Lori was going to talk a
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
little bit about what travel and tourism
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
has done and some of their strateg IES
 
00:33:29.509 --> 00:33:29.519 align:start position:0%
for marketing around the state that they
 
00:33:32.029 --> 00:33:32.039 align:start position:0%
use the travel and tour tourism fund for
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
to give the committee a sense of um of
 
00:33:36.789 --> 00:33:36.799 align:start position:0%
of what's being done to try to bring the
 
00:33:39.710 --> 00:33:39.720 align:start position:0%
the um travel and tourism in New
 
00:33:41.870 --> 00:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and keep it in New Hampshire
 
00:33:43.470 --> 00:33:43.480 align:start position:0%
um that was based on the questions that
 
00:33:45.509 --> 00:33:45.519 align:start position:0%
came up at the last or two a couple
 
00:33:47.870 --> 00:33:47.880 align:start position:0%
meetings ago so I don't know if Lori
 
00:33:49.789 --> 00:33:49.799 align:start position:0%
wants to go and present to you first and
 
00:33:52.310 --> 00:33:52.320 align:start position:0%
then let questions come after that would
 
00:33:52.320 --> 00:33:53.190 align:start position:0%
then let questions come after that would
be

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:53.200 align:start position:0%

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:12.960 align:start position:0%
had sent over ahead of time hopefully it
 
00:34:15.470 --> 00:34:15.480 align:start position:0%
provided some background on our research
 
00:34:18.550 --> 00:34:18.560 align:start position:0%
but also showed um you some of our most
 
00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:21.560 align:start position:0%
recent marketing efforts and uh why
 
00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:24.000 align:start position:0%
travel and tourism is so critical to New
 
00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's economy um dtds mission is
 
00:34:29.629 --> 00:34:29.639 align:start position:0%
to promote the state of New Hampshire as
 
00:34:32.510 --> 00:34:32.520 align:start position:0%
a domestic and international travel
 
00:34:34.629 --> 00:34:34.639 align:start position:0%
destination in order to increase
 
00:34:37.149 --> 00:34:37.159 align:start position:0%
visitation and travel expenditures
 
00:34:39.349 --> 00:34:39.359 align:start position:0%
business activity and employment
 
00:34:42.510 --> 00:34:42.520 align:start position:0%
throughout the state as I am sure you're
 
00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240 align:start position:0%
aware travel and tourism was the hardest
 
00:34:48.190 --> 00:34:48.200 align:start position:0%
hit industry during this pandemic
 
00:34:50.909 --> 00:34:50.919 align:start position:0%
collectively the industry was forced to
 
00:34:54.990 --> 00:34:55.000 align:start position:0%
lay off over 40,000 individuals um from
 
00:34:58.670 --> 00:34:58.680 align:start position:0%
an industry Workforce of about
 
00:35:02.150 --> 00:35:02.160 align:start position:0%
70,000 while we have slowly recovered
 
00:35:05.030 --> 00:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
this industry is still very much in
 
00:35:08.270 --> 00:35:08.280 align:start position:0%
need funding our office will be critical
 
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:10.280 align:start position:0%
in helping the industry to the road to
 
00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
recovery many of them don't have the
 
00:35:15.349 --> 00:35:15.359 align:start position:0%
resources to Market on their own they
 
00:35:18.150 --> 00:35:18.160 align:start position:0%
also need to direct their time energy
 
00:35:22.349 --> 00:35:22.359 align:start position:0%
and budgets to hiring people back buying
 
00:35:25.190 --> 00:35:25.200 align:start position:0%
inventory and getting their B businesses
 
00:35:28.310 --> 00:35:28.320 align:start position:0%
uh up and running again they really rely
 
00:35:30.630 --> 00:35:30.640 align:start position:0%
upon our marketing efforts to bring the
 
00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
visitors to
 
00:35:34.829 --> 00:35:34.839 align:start position:0%
them you know experts predict that as
 
00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200 align:start position:0%
more people are vaccinated consumer
 
00:35:39.310 --> 00:35:39.320 align:start position:0%
confidence is going to grow creating
 
00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119 align:start position:0%
great potential for a successful summer
 
00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:45.680 align:start position:0%
season and Beyond people have pent up
 
00:35:48.910 --> 00:35:48.920 align:start position:0%
demand to to to get out and enjoy the
 
00:35:50.990 --> 00:35:51.000 align:start position:0%
things that we used to do I know I do
 
00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:52.839 align:start position:0%
I'm I'm assuming you do it's just what
 
00:35:54.670 --> 00:35:54.680 align:start position:0%
we're all feeling right
 
00:35:57.309 --> 00:35:57.319 align:start position:0%
now at this time do critical
 
00:35:59.470 --> 00:35:59.480 align:start position:0%
is even more critical that we keep our
 
00:36:01.870 --> 00:36:01.880 align:start position:0%
foot on the gas and remain competitive
 
00:36:04.750 --> 00:36:04.760 align:start position:0%
with our neighboring states competition
 
00:36:06.910 --> 00:36:06.920 align:start position:0%
is going to be fierce coming out of this
 
00:36:09.870 --> 00:36:09.880 align:start position:0%
pandemic Vermont is looking to raise
 
00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:12.920 align:start position:0%
their budget to be closer to ours in the
 
00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:15.560 align:start position:0%
past Maine already has a budget that is
 
00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:17.720 align:start position:0%
a couple million dollars higher than
 
00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:21.240 align:start position:0%
ours and before Co began we were gaining
 
00:36:23.230 --> 00:36:23.240 align:start position:0%
market share on our neighboring states
 
00:36:25.750 --> 00:36:25.760 align:start position:0%
so let's not lose that positive traction
 
00:36:29.190 --> 00:36:29.200 align:start position:0%
that we had um accomplished the other
 
00:36:31.430 --> 00:36:31.440 align:start position:0%
very important fact is our strong return
 
00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:34.160 align:start position:0%
on investment for this data we use an
 
00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:36.800 align:start position:0%
independent research firm that is out
 
00:36:39.630 --> 00:36:39.640 align:start position:0%
outside of our Ad Agency they're called
 
00:36:42.510 --> 00:36:42.520 align:start position:0%
um smari the acronym but it's strategic
 
00:36:46.069 --> 00:36:46.079 align:start position:0%
marketing and research insights they are
 
00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
National a nationally known research
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
company they do a variety of work for
 
00:36:52.710 --> 00:36:52.720 align:start position:0%
multiple States um and we've been
 
00:36:54.829 --> 00:36:54.839 align:start position:0%
working with them for the over the past
 
00:36:57.190 --> 00:36:57.200 align:start position:0%
five years so we've got a good amount of
 
00:36:59.950 --> 00:36:59.960 align:start position:0%
data to compare to through their
 
00:37:02.349 --> 00:37:02.359 align:start position:0%
research which all of our research is is
 
00:37:04.390 --> 00:37:04.400 align:start position:0%
on visit andh our website and the
 
00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:07.359 align:start position:0%
industry section so it's available to
 
00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480 align:start position:0%
the industry and the public but through
 
00:37:12.309 --> 00:37:12.319 align:start position:0%
our research we conduct advertising
 
00:37:14.470 --> 00:37:14.480 align:start position:0%
Effectiveness reports from each of our
 
00:37:17.470 --> 00:37:17.480 align:start position:0%
seasonal campaigns and these reports
 
00:37:19.670 --> 00:37:19.680 align:start position:0%
tell us the number of people we
 
00:37:22.069 --> 00:37:22.079 align:start position:0%
influence to travel to New Hampshire as
 
00:37:24.950 --> 00:37:24.960 align:start position:0%
a direct result of our marketing efforts
 
00:37:26.990 --> 00:37:27.000 align:start position:0%
the seasonal reports are then used to
 
00:37:30.109 --> 00:37:30.119 align:start position:0%
complete our um yearly return on
 
00:37:34.349 --> 00:37:34.359 align:start position:0%
investment in calendar year 2019 over
 
00:37:37.030 --> 00:37:37.040 align:start position:0%
11.5 million visitors came to New
 
00:37:41.710 --> 00:37:41.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire spending $5.6 billion doar and
 
00:37:45.030 --> 00:37:45.040 align:start position:0%
our fiscal year 2019 research shows that
 
00:37:54.750 --> 00:37:54.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:54.760 --> 00:37:57.109 align:start position:0%
 
636,000

00:37:57.109 --> 00:37:57.119 align:start position:0%
636,000
 
00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:01.200 align:start position:0%
generating $33 million in taxes
 
00:38:04.349 --> 00:38:04.359 align:start position:0%
therefore every marketing dollar spent
 
00:38:06.990 --> 00:38:07.000 align:start position:0%
$3 is returned in
 
00:38:09.670 --> 00:38:09.680 align:start position:0%
taxes finally I just wanted to say that
 
00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:12.400 align:start position:0%
our efforts don't only help the tourism
 
00:38:15.190 --> 00:38:15.200 align:start position:0%
industry they support the overall future
 
00:38:18.309 --> 00:38:18.319 align:start position:0%
economy of New Hampshire today's tourist
 
00:38:21.750 --> 00:38:21.760 align:start position:0%
is tomorrow's Talent the whole concept
 
00:38:24.109 --> 00:38:24.119 align:start position:0%
of live where you play is even more
 
00:38:27.109 --> 00:38:27.119 align:start position:0%
prominent now I guess a silver Ling to
 
00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has been people
 
00:38:31.430 --> 00:38:31.440 align:start position:0%
re-evaluating life and where they really
 
00:38:34.390 --> 00:38:34.400 align:start position:0%
want to be and what's important to them
 
00:38:36.670 --> 00:38:36.680 align:start position:0%
the pandemic has also pushed us to be
 
00:38:39.109 --> 00:38:39.119 align:start position:0%
more acceptable of a work setting where
 
00:38:41.309 --> 00:38:41.319 align:start position:0%
you can work remotely and New Hampshire
 
00:38:44.230 --> 00:38:44.240 align:start position:0%
provides a great backdrop to that so
 
00:38:46.430 --> 00:38:46.440 align:start position:0%
please I encourage you to help us be
 
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:47.960 align:start position:0%
part of this movement and make New
 
00:38:49.990 --> 00:38:50.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire the best place to live work
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
and play in the Northeast um so thank
 
00:38:54.510 --> 00:38:54.520 align:start position:0%

00:38:56.150 --> 00:38:56.160 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions at this
 
00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.950 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer questions at this
time

00:38:57.950 --> 00:38:57.960 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:39:01.750 --> 00:39:01.760 align:start position:0%
yes we all know that travel and tourism
 
00:39:05.349 --> 00:39:05.359 align:start position:0%
helps at least six of our major taxes
 
00:39:05.359 --> 00:39:06.589 align:start position:0%
helps at least six of our major taxes
business

00:39:06.589 --> 00:39:06.599 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:39:09.190 --> 00:39:09.200 align:start position:0%
taxes Tobacco
 
00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:12.880 align:start position:0%
liquor and the big one meals and rooms
 
00:39:17.270 --> 00:39:17.280 align:start position:0%
and the gasoline tax which supports our
 
00:39:19.950 --> 00:39:19.960 align:start position:0%
highway to to a great
 
00:39:23.069 --> 00:39:23.079 align:start position:0%
degree what is your
 
00:39:28.150 --> 00:39:28.160 align:start position:0%
projection uh for the tra travel tourism
 
00:39:31.430 --> 00:39:31.440 align:start position:0%
business coming out at the by the end of
 
00:39:34.790 --> 00:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
the year what percentage do you feel it
 
00:39:36.030 --> 00:39:36.040 align:start position:0%
will be
 
00:39:38.510 --> 00:39:38.520 align:start position:0%
back yeah this is a very good question
 
00:39:40.270 --> 00:39:40.280 align:start position:0%
at this point in time we don't
 
00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:42.480 align:start position:0%
specifically have any forecasts just
 
00:39:45.150 --> 00:39:45.160 align:start position:0%
because there so many variables in the
 
00:39:48.230 --> 00:39:48.240 align:start position:0%
air in regards to the pandemic but we do
 
00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480 align:start position:0%
we are expecting a very um a profitable
 
00:39:54.870 --> 00:39:54.880 align:start position:0%
summer season with things beginning to
 
00:39:57.990 --> 00:39:58.000 align:start position:0%
open up more in uh regulations or
 
00:40:00.790 --> 00:40:00.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions being eased um and as I
 
00:40:03.910 --> 00:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
mentioned with the pent up demand of um
 
00:40:05.750 --> 00:40:05.760 align:start position:0%
Travelers wanting to get out and do the
 
00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:07.760 align:start position:0%
things that we used to do but at this
 
00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:09.680 align:start position:0%
point in time I don't have specific
 
00:40:13.190 --> 00:40:13.200 align:start position:0%
figures that I can share with you on
 
00:40:15.910 --> 00:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
forecast okay representative
 
00:40:19.150 --> 00:40:19.160 align:start position:0%
Brony uh thank you Mr chair uh thank you
 
00:40:22.630 --> 00:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
uh a nice presentation um it seems that
 
00:40:24.550 --> 00:40:24.560 align:start position:0%
in February our our ski conditions were
 
00:40:26.950 --> 00:40:26.960 align:start position:0%
very good um every time I fact that it
 
00:40:28.870 --> 00:40:28.880 align:start position:0%
seemed like the most of the terrain was
 
00:40:31.829 --> 00:40:31.839 align:start position:0%
open uh do you have any any gauge on how
 
00:40:34.470 --> 00:40:34.480 align:start position:0%
well the ri area is did this season and
 
00:40:35.510 --> 00:40:35.520 align:start position:0%
that would
 
00:40:38.349 --> 00:40:38.359 align:start position:0%
obviously have an impact on the local
 
00:40:39.829 --> 00:40:39.839 align:start position:0%
businesses and so
 
00:40:43.870 --> 00:40:43.880 align:start position:0%
forth yeah so uh the you know ant
 
00:40:46.550 --> 00:40:46.560 align:start position:0%
antidotal uh uh information that we've
 
00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:48.680 align:start position:0%
received through ski New Hampshire and
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
percentages of how the ski resorts are
 
00:40:53.190 --> 00:40:53.200 align:start position:0%
doing you're absolutely right that they
 
00:40:57.150 --> 00:40:57.160 align:start position:0%
did um have a good season um you know it
 
00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:00.440 align:start position:0%
was uh with all things considered um but
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
they did um you know most of the resorts
 
00:41:06.510 --> 00:41:06.520 align:start position:0%
they had uh full capacity that with the
 
00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:08.240 align:start position:0%
amounts that they were allowed to have
 
00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:12.160 align:start position:0%
there so um it does seem as though the
 
00:41:14.309 --> 00:41:14.319 align:start position:0%
the ski areas did do well this winter
 
00:41:17.670 --> 00:41:17.680 align:start position:0%
season with all things considered okay
 
00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119 align:start position:0%
is that probably a good alen for uh the
 
00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:22.480 align:start position:0%
spring and the summer hopefully yes
 
00:41:25.750 --> 00:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
hopefully yes we've heard you know just
 
00:41:29.309 --> 00:41:29.319 align:start position:0%
uh through industry that um a lot of the
 
00:41:32.589 --> 00:41:32.599 align:start position:0%
um uh like uh businesses throughout the
 
00:41:35.470 --> 00:41:35.480 align:start position:0%
leak Lakes Region they already have
 
00:41:37.790 --> 00:41:37.800 align:start position:0%
advanced booking for the summer season
 
00:41:40.829 --> 00:41:40.839 align:start position:0%
so you know I think that people are
 
00:41:43.069 --> 00:41:43.079 align:start position:0%
consumer confidence is gaining and
 
00:41:45.349 --> 00:41:45.359 align:start position:0%
people are can
 
00:41:48.270 --> 00:41:48.280 align:start position:0%
um imagine themselves going out on
 
00:41:49.990 --> 00:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
vacation for the summer so they are
 
00:41:53.230 --> 00:41:53.240 align:start position:0%
beginning to book more frequently now so
 
00:41:56.270 --> 00:41:56.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent Aly followed by
 
00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.950 align:start position:0%
okay thank you represent Aly followed by
representative

00:41:57.950 --> 00:41:57.960 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:42:03.630 --> 00:42:03.640 align:start position:0%
tar thank you Mr chairman and the one
 
00:42:07.950 --> 00:42:07.960 align:start position:0%
thing that this conversation is about is
 
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:11.280 align:start position:0%
the hp2 language and I don't think that
 
00:42:13.990 --> 00:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
uh Miss harness uh I'm not sure how you
 
00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:14.870 align:start position:0%
uh Miss harness uh I'm not sure how you
pronounce

00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
pronounce
 
00:42:18.430 --> 00:42:18.440 align:start position:0%
you uh is going to be here when we're
 
00:42:20.790 --> 00:42:20.800 align:start position:0%
discussing it may I ask a question about
 
00:42:27.790 --> 00:42:27.800 align:start position:0%
it you may thank you on section 55 page
 
00:42:30.990 --> 00:42:31.000 align:start position:0%
26 lines 3 to5 of
 
00:42:35.230 --> 00:42:35.240 align:start position:0%
hb2 suspends all of the tourism
 
00:42:39.470 --> 00:42:39.480 align:start position:0%
marketing money for two years uh this is
 
00:42:42.430 --> 00:42:42.440 align:start position:0%
the first time that has happened since
 
00:42:45.589 --> 00:42:45.599 align:start position:0%
uh I believe uh speaker O'Brien got it
 
00:42:53.190 --> 00:42:53.200 align:start position:0%
suspended also uh it was in instated in
 
00:42:58.790 --> 00:42:58.800 align:start position:0%
2009 uh as a tradeoff to the uh
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
restaurant and lodging people because we
 
00:43:05.430 --> 00:43:05.440 align:start position:0%
were increasing the ooms and meals tax
 
00:43:09.549 --> 00:43:09.559 align:start position:0%
to 9% in order to get through the Great
 
00:43:13.030 --> 00:43:13.040 align:start position:0%
Recession and ever since that was
 
00:43:16.430 --> 00:43:16.440 align:start position:0%
instated they have been growing at 5% a
 
00:43:18.670 --> 00:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
year which is
 
00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:22.640 align:start position:0%
phenomenal and that marketing money is
 
00:43:26.430 --> 00:43:26.440 align:start position:0%
important most particularly to the media
 
00:43:29.470 --> 00:43:29.480 align:start position:0%
and smaller Enterprises inside of New
 
00:43:31.630 --> 00:43:31.640 align:start position:0%
Hampshire because the larger ones could
 
00:43:35.710 --> 00:43:35.720 align:start position:0%
do their own marketing and sometimes do
 
00:43:39.589 --> 00:43:39.599 align:start position:0%
on but the others cannot and they are
 
00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:43.400 align:start position:0%
branding New Hampshire as a destination
 
00:43:46.430 --> 00:43:46.440 align:start position:0%
in the places that are most
 
00:43:50.829 --> 00:43:50.839 align:start position:0%
important uh to reach on at the time
 
00:43:52.549 --> 00:43:52.559 align:start position:0%
like for instance I doubt very much that
 
00:43:54.790 --> 00:43:54.800 align:start position:0%
they're doing much in Europe because the
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
Europeans ain't going to be able to to
 
00:43:59.710 --> 00:43:59.720 align:start position:0%
come so uh and during the Great
 
00:44:01.549 --> 00:44:01.559 align:start position:0%
Recession they turned their attention
 
00:44:04.589 --> 00:44:04.599 align:start position:0%
also to our neighboring states down
 
00:44:08.470 --> 00:44:08.480 align:start position:0%
through New Jersey I think it was and um
 
00:44:11.670 --> 00:44:11.680 align:start position:0%
got us a lot more tourism and a lot more
 
00:44:13.589 --> 00:44:13.599 align:start position:0%
of what the chairman has been talking
 
00:44:15.069 --> 00:44:15.079 align:start position:0%
about in all of our
 
00:44:22.950 --> 00:44:22.960 align:start position:0%
taxes on and and I would just like to to
 
00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:28.440 align:start position:0%
um notice and ask uh miss haros about it
 
00:44:32.630 --> 00:44:32.640 align:start position:0%
uh there on there was a claim that you
 
00:44:36.069 --> 00:44:36.079 align:start position:0%
get I think it was $13 back for every
 
00:44:40.349 --> 00:44:40.359 align:start position:0%
dollar uh in ta we get $13 back in taxes
 
00:44:42.950 --> 00:44:42.960 align:start position:0%
for every dollar that is spent in this
 
00:44:45.829 --> 00:44:45.839 align:start position:0%
marketing program and
 
00:44:49.150 --> 00:44:49.160 align:start position:0%
over the years since this was instated
 
00:44:52.710 --> 00:44:52.720 align:start position:0%
it's been studied by the folks at uh
 
00:44:55.670 --> 00:44:55.680 align:start position:0%
Plymouth State University and they they
 
00:44:58.030 --> 00:44:58.040 align:start position:0%
were the last time I saw one of theirs
 
00:45:00.349 --> 00:45:00.359 align:start position:0%
which was about at least five years ago
 
00:45:05.109 --> 00:45:05.119 align:start position:0%
on we were getting 8 back so on can you
 
00:45:09.430 --> 00:45:09.440 align:start position:0%
say something about why the returns
 
00:45:12.549 --> 00:45:12.559 align:start position:0%
grown yeah absolutely so I think that
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
you know part of the reason is that we
 
00:45:18.750 --> 00:45:18.760 align:start position:0%
have become even um better at targeting
 
00:45:22.230 --> 00:45:22.240 align:start position:0%
our marketing we use different types of
 
00:45:25.349 --> 00:45:25.359 align:start position:0%
um like arrival lists so that we can try
 
00:45:28.270 --> 00:45:28.280 align:start position:0%
to find those specific consumers or
 
00:45:30.589 --> 00:45:30.599 align:start position:0%
visitors that are are interested in what
 
00:45:33.750 --> 00:45:33.760 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has to offer so we've been
 
00:45:37.870 --> 00:45:37.880 align:start position:0%
able to do that um with the um the the
 
00:45:39.710 --> 00:45:39.720 align:start position:0%
funding that we have had in the past
 
00:45:42.549 --> 00:45:42.559 align:start position:0%
we've been able to extend our um
 
00:45:45.069 --> 00:45:45.079 align:start position:0%
marketing efforts and in such places as
 
00:45:47.750 --> 00:45:47.760 align:start position:0%
you mentioned like New Jersey New York
 
00:45:50.270 --> 00:45:50.280 align:start position:0%
um and we have uh seen that we've
 
00:45:53.630 --> 00:45:53.640 align:start position:0%
actually gained market share um in those
 
00:45:56.630 --> 00:45:56.640 align:start position:0%
markets um specifically like from states
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
of like Vermont so we're gaining their
 
00:46:01.510 --> 00:46:01.520 align:start position:0%
visitors that typically are from New
 
00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:03.040 align:start position:0%
York going to Vermont they're now
 
00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800 align:start position:0%
choosing New Hampshire to come so um as
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
part of that um you know people who are
 
00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:12.440 align:start position:0%
typically coming from a farther distance
 
00:46:15.390 --> 00:46:15.400 align:start position:0%
um will stay longer they spend more
 
00:46:17.990 --> 00:46:18.000 align:start position:0%
money while they're here so these are
 
00:46:21.390 --> 00:46:21.400 align:start position:0%
very good um Travelers for us to Target
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
so um that's part of the reason of why
 
00:46:27.829 --> 00:46:27.839 align:start position:0%
the uh the uh return on investment has
 
00:46:32.910 --> 00:46:32.920 align:start position:0%
grown over uh since 2009 um so hopefully
 
00:46:36.230 --> 00:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
that that answered your question to some
 
00:46:39.630 --> 00:46:39.640 align:start position:0%
degree yes thank you I would like to
 
00:46:44.349 --> 00:46:44.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:47.670 --> 00:46:47.680 align:start position:0%
section representative Tucker uh Chris
 
00:46:49.950 --> 00:46:49.960 align:start position:0%
did you have something I I just wanted
 
00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:52.119 align:start position:0%
to yeah I did I just wanted to clarify
 
00:46:54.430 --> 00:46:54.440 align:start position:0%
that section though it suspends the
 
00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
piece of law
 
00:46:58.349 --> 00:46:58.359 align:start position:0%
the travel and tourism is still
 
00:46:59.470 --> 00:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
receiving an
 
00:47:01.589 --> 00:47:01.599 align:start position:0%
appropriation over the bium they're
 
00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
they're going to be appropriated about
 
00:47:02.880 --> 00:47:04.430 align:start position:0%
they're going to be appropriated about
$17

00:47:04.430 --> 00:47:04.440 align:start position:0%
$17
 
00:47:07.510 --> 00:47:07.520 align:start position:0%
million so it it's all that all that
 
00:47:11.470 --> 00:47:11.480 align:start position:0%
suspension is doing is um limiting or or
 
00:47:13.750 --> 00:47:13.760 align:start position:0%
not binding the governor when he
 
00:47:16.349 --> 00:47:16.359 align:start position:0%
proposed the the bill um to a certain
 
00:47:18.230 --> 00:47:18.240 align:start position:0%
appropriation level that would otherwise
 
00:47:19.430 --> 00:47:19.440 align:start position:0%
need to happen I think it would be a
 
00:47:22.069 --> 00:47:22.079 align:start position:0%
couple million dollars higher if that
 
00:47:24.870 --> 00:47:24.880 align:start position:0%
language wasn't there so so I just want
 
00:47:26.230 --> 00:47:26.240 align:start position:0%
to make it clear to the committee that
 
00:47:27.829 --> 00:47:27.839 align:start position:0%
that the travel and tourism is being
 
00:47:30.670 --> 00:47:30.680 align:start position:0%
funded the travel and tourism fund will
 
00:47:32.150 --> 00:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
have money in it to spend on New
 
00:47:35.109 --> 00:47:35.119 align:start position:0%
Hampshire promotions um it just may be a
 
00:47:37.309 --> 00:47:37.319 align:start position:0%
little less than um what would have
 
00:47:39.470 --> 00:47:39.480 align:start position:0%
occurred under the the law that's being
 
00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:42.000 align:start position:0%
suspended which has been suspended
 
00:47:44.349 --> 00:47:44.359 align:start position:0%
pretty regularly by the legislature um
 
00:47:45.710 --> 00:47:45.720 align:start position:0%
over the last few
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
bienniums um because again because the
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
uh the limited resources to apply to all
 
00:47:56.750 --> 00:47:56.760 align:start position:0%
the different needs around the state
 
00:47:59.670 --> 00:47:59.680 align:start position:0%
um Governors and legislators have have
 
00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:01.680 align:start position:0%
made decisions to suspend that piece of
 
00:48:04.309 --> 00:48:04.319 align:start position:0%
legislation um throughout the throughout
 
00:48:06.309 --> 00:48:06.319 align:start position:0%
the years um so I just want to make that
 
00:48:08.150 --> 00:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
clear because I think I heard that they
 
00:48:10.150 --> 00:48:10.160 align:start position:0%
didn't have any money as a result of
 
00:48:12.790 --> 00:48:12.800 align:start position:0%
that being suspended and in fact they do
 
00:48:14.230 --> 00:48:14.240 align:start position:0%
it's just maybe a little bit less than
 
00:48:15.870 --> 00:48:15.880 align:start position:0%
they would without the suspension so
 
00:48:17.670 --> 00:48:17.680 align:start position:0%
that's all I
 
00:48:22.390 --> 00:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
had thank you Chris that on nobody had
 
00:48:25.710 --> 00:48:25.720 align:start position:0%
had mentioned that to me while I've been
 
00:48:25.720 --> 00:48:27.790 align:start position:0%
had mentioned that to me while I've been
freaking

00:48:27.790 --> 00:48:27.800 align:start position:0%
freaking
 
00:48:30.710 --> 00:48:30.720 align:start position:0%
out my apologies I I probably should
 
00:48:32.510 --> 00:48:32.520 align:start position:0%
have done that the other day and I just
 
00:48:34.910 --> 00:48:34.920 align:start position:0%
probably was distracted
 
00:48:40.990 --> 00:48:41.000 align:start position:0%
so could I just on add on one one
 
00:48:43.390 --> 00:48:43.400 align:start position:0%
question on that I think would be of
 
00:48:45.030 --> 00:48:45.040 align:start position:0%
interest to those of us on the committee
 
00:48:48.589 --> 00:48:48.599 align:start position:0%
before this time they seem to be
 
00:48:54.630 --> 00:48:54.640 align:start position:0%
deleting the the uh division of of uh
 
00:48:57.309 --> 00:48:57.319 align:start position:0%
film and digital Bureau of film and
 
00:48:57.319 --> 00:48:59.630 align:start position:0%
film and digital Bureau of film and
digital

00:48:59.630 --> 00:48:59.640 align:start position:0%
digital
 
00:49:04.349 --> 00:49:04.359 align:start position:0%
media on and on I think that our
 
00:49:06.630 --> 00:49:06.640 align:start position:0%
committee would be happy about that but
 
00:49:08.990 --> 00:49:09.000 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know what you think
 
00:49:13.150 --> 00:49:13.160 align:start position:0%
about yeah so you know we with with the
 
00:49:16.270 --> 00:49:16.280 align:start position:0%
state of um where we are we had to make
 
00:49:17.950 --> 00:49:17.960 align:start position:0%
difficult decisions and so we had to
 
00:49:20.309 --> 00:49:20.319 align:start position:0%
look at a variety of you know all of our
 
00:49:23.710 --> 00:49:23.720 align:start position:0%
different programs and what we felt was
 
00:49:26.829 --> 00:49:26.839 align:start position:0%
um providing the the the biggest return
 
00:49:30.630 --> 00:49:30.640 align:start position:0%
for us so um you know we do feel that
 
00:49:33.870 --> 00:49:33.880 align:start position:0%
there is the opportunity for us to still
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
use um the tourism backdrop drop similar
 
00:49:41.109 --> 00:49:41.119 align:start position:0%
to what we do within trying to um
 
00:49:43.510 --> 00:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
encourage today's tourist to be
 
00:49:45.789 --> 00:49:45.799 align:start position:0%
tomorrow's talent in the economic sense
 
00:49:48.549 --> 00:49:48.559 align:start position:0%
that we could use tourism on the film
 
00:49:50.549 --> 00:49:50.559 align:start position:0%
side and through our marketing efforts
 
00:49:54.470 --> 00:49:54.480 align:start position:0%
kind of um blend it in with that so you
 
00:49:56.230 --> 00:49:56.240 align:start position:0%
know I think that there could could be
 
00:49:59.470 --> 00:49:59.480 align:start position:0%
uh we just felt that that was probably
 
00:50:01.150 --> 00:50:01.160 align:start position:0%
the best way we should should do this
 
00:50:04.829 --> 00:50:04.839 align:start position:0%
for this year so okay representative
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
Tucker uh yes thank you for taking my
 
00:50:11.470 --> 00:50:11.480 align:start position:0%
question uh tell me what are you hearing
 
00:50:16.270 --> 00:50:16.280 align:start position:0%
from the uh State Parks and Recreation
 
00:50:18.430 --> 00:50:18.440 align:start position:0%
are the state parks going to be open are
 
00:50:20.750 --> 00:50:20.760 align:start position:0%
there reservations opening up now for
 
00:50:24.109 --> 00:50:24.119 align:start position:0%
the summer how how are we coming on that
 
00:50:26.309 --> 00:50:26.319 align:start position:0%
whole project
 
00:50:29.230 --> 00:50:29.240 align:start position:0%
for the yes yes thank you representative
 
00:50:31.390 --> 00:50:31.400 align:start position:0%
Tucker so we do work closely obviously
 
00:50:34.430 --> 00:50:34.440 align:start position:0%
with state parks I just saw a notice
 
00:50:36.789 --> 00:50:36.799 align:start position:0%
from them saying about um certain Parks
 
00:50:39.230 --> 00:50:39.240 align:start position:0%
opening I believe it was you're gonna
 
00:50:40.990 --> 00:50:41.000 align:start position:0%
have to correct me if I'm wrong but I
 
00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:43.200 align:start position:0%
believe it was towards the end of April
 
00:50:44.630 --> 00:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
that they were going to be beginning to
 
00:50:48.150 --> 00:50:48.160 align:start position:0%
open so that's positive news um we also
 
00:50:51.109 --> 00:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
are working very closely with them um on
 
00:50:55.750 --> 00:50:55.760 align:start position:0%
initiatives about um uh you know how we
 
00:50:58.829 --> 00:50:58.839 align:start position:0%
had issues last year with overcrowding
 
00:51:02.670 --> 00:51:02.680 align:start position:0%
and um trying to um disperse the the
 
00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:04.280 align:start position:0%
visitors to a variety of different
 
00:51:06.270 --> 00:51:06.280 align:start position:0%
locations so that um you know our
 
00:51:09.589 --> 00:51:09.599 align:start position:0%
natural attributes are um sustained and
 
00:51:11.430 --> 00:51:11.440 align:start position:0%
people can continue to enjoy them
 
00:51:15.390 --> 00:51:15.400 align:start position:0%
throughout um years to come so um we are
 
00:51:17.950 --> 00:51:17.960 align:start position:0%
hoping that state parks will have a a a
 
00:51:19.950 --> 00:51:19.960 align:start position:0%
profitable and good summer season as
 
00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
well and open as uh soon as they can
 
00:51:26.589 --> 00:51:26.599 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:29.240 align:start position:0%
Elliot thank you Mr chairman and welcome
 
00:51:32.190 --> 00:51:32.200 align:start position:0%
Lori uh you stated that you don't have
 
00:51:35.190 --> 00:51:35.200 align:start position:0%
specific figures for us uh my question
 
00:51:38.510 --> 00:51:38.520 align:start position:0%
is when will you have specific figures
 
00:51:42.549 --> 00:51:42.559 align:start position:0%
for the State of New Hampshire and its
 
00:51:44.390 --> 00:51:44.400 align:start position:0%
representativ uh yes thank you
 
00:51:47.069 --> 00:51:47.079 align:start position:0%
representative Elliot you know for we
 
00:51:49.190 --> 00:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
don't have the specific figures again
 
00:51:52.109 --> 00:51:52.119 align:start position:0%
for the forecasting and and ultimately
 
00:51:54.390 --> 00:51:54.400 align:start position:0%
it's for because of all the variables
 
00:51:56.510 --> 00:51:56.520 align:start position:0%
that are out there with the p pandemic
 
00:52:00.789 --> 00:52:00.799 align:start position:0%
um we do work with smari uh the um
 
00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:03.079 align:start position:0%
research company that I had referenced
 
00:52:05.670 --> 00:52:05.680 align:start position:0%
typically for these types of forecasts
 
00:52:09.069 --> 00:52:09.079 align:start position:0%
and as we begin to recover from this
 
00:52:11.349 --> 00:52:11.359 align:start position:0%
pandemic we would imagine that we would
 
00:52:15.069 --> 00:52:15.079 align:start position:0%
um begin to to produce those reports uh
 
00:52:17.910 --> 00:52:17.920 align:start position:0%
as we typically have done in the past so
 
00:52:20.470 --> 00:52:20.480 align:start position:0%
I don't have a specific date to to give
 
00:52:22.710 --> 00:52:22.720 align:start position:0%
you that we would do that but um we're
 
00:52:25.470 --> 00:52:25.480 align:start position:0%
hopeful that we'll we'll be doing that
 
00:52:28.349 --> 00:52:28.359 align:start position:0%
um soon again as we as we recover from
 
00:52:32.710 --> 00:52:32.720 align:start position:0%
the pandemic thank you any further
 
00:52:37.549 --> 00:52:37.559 align:start position:0%
questions ask see none we thank you for
 
00:52:40.309 --> 00:52:40.319 align:start position:0%

00:52:41.710 --> 00:52:41.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for the
 
00:52:45.870 --> 00:52:45.880 align:start position:0%
time and Chris uh who do we have next
 
00:52:47.309 --> 00:52:47.319 align:start position:0%
why don't we go with insurance I know
 
00:52:50.670 --> 00:52:50.680 align:start position:0%
there's a number of people on the um
 
00:52:52.230 --> 00:52:52.240 align:start position:0%
attendees list from insurance you have
 
00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:55.000 align:start position:0%
the commissioner nicolopoulos and Norma
 
00:52:58.789 --> 00:52:58.799 align:start position:0%
St ings Deputy Commissioner
 
00:53:03.390 --> 00:53:03.400 align:start position:0%
rice and um maybe Amy doam may need to
 
00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:06.680 align:start position:0%
come into the call as well if I anybody
 
00:53:09.270 --> 00:53:09.280 align:start position:0%
the commissioner can let us
 
00:53:13.390 --> 00:53:13.400 align:start position:0%
know who wants um who wants to start off
 
00:53:19.030 --> 00:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
from the insurance department Ro
 
00:53:22.309 --> 00:53:22.319 align:start position:0%
status ready go uh Chris nickop here I'm
 
00:53:24.390 --> 00:53:24.400 align:start position:0%
just going to do a quick intro and defer
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
to our expert noral stalling I think
 
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:28.920 align:start position:0%
Christy rice is here as well in case
 
00:53:32.270 --> 00:53:32.280 align:start position:0%
either of us missed something uh as you
 
00:53:35.069 --> 00:53:35.079 align:start position:0%
probably know this is a busy week for us
 
00:53:38.390 --> 00:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
uh as of Monday all of our premium tax
 
00:53:41.230 --> 00:53:41.240 align:start position:0%
was due uh that's typically uh north of
 
00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:44.400 align:start position:0%
a100 million and so though NOA doesn't
 
00:53:45.950 --> 00:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
have audited numbers for you yet I think
 
00:53:48.470 --> 00:53:48.480 align:start position:0%
she's going to be able to give you a a
 
00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:50.440 align:start position:0%
preview on what that looks like and
 
00:53:53.670 --> 00:53:53.680 align:start position:0%
updates for uh 22 and 23 so I'll pass it
 
00:53:55.190 --> 00:53:55.200 align:start position:0%
off to Norma but I'll stay on in case
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
you have any
 
00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:58.510 align:start position:0%
you have any
questions

00:53:58.510 --> 00:53:58.520 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:54:02.349 --> 00:54:02.359 align:start position:0%
okay nor how how do we look for
 
00:54:06.230 --> 00:54:06.240 align:start position:0%
estimates for 22 23 and
 
00:54:10.390 --> 00:54:10.400 align:start position:0%
24 okay you want
 
00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.150 align:start position:0%
24 okay you want
uh

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
22 we originally projected uh 127
 
00:54:21.190 --> 00:54:21.200 align:start position:0%
million uh based on what we see
 
00:54:25.470 --> 00:54:25.480 align:start position:0%
currently coming in for fiscal year 202
 
00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:31.640 align:start position:0%
21 I would uh give you a range from the
 
00:54:36.109 --> 00:54:36.119 align:start position:0%
127 million up to 130
 
00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:40.480 align:start position:0%
million uh again they that's for 21 this
 
00:54:42.230 --> 00:54:42.240 align:start position:0%
oh this is for 22 I thought you wanted
 
00:54:48.390 --> 00:54:48.400 align:start position:0%
22 the 21 was back up then in like I say
 
00:54:51.309 --> 00:54:51.319 align:start position:0%
the estimates originally back in
 
00:54:56.069 --> 00:54:56.079 align:start position:0%
November we had anticipated the impact
 
00:55:01.349 --> 00:55:01.359 align:start position:0%
of the auto paybacks and the
 
00:55:04.230 --> 00:55:04.240 align:start position:0%
unemployment as well as a shift in the
 
00:55:10.230 --> 00:55:10.240 align:start position:0%
health um premium Market would impact
 
00:55:13.990 --> 00:55:14.000 align:start position:0%
downwardly what we would see but is as
 
00:55:17.109 --> 00:55:17.119 align:start position:0%
it turns out there's been a very small
 
00:55:24.270 --> 00:55:24.280 align:start position:0%
impact to the um Auto and the increases
 
00:55:26.549 --> 00:55:26.559 align:start position:0%
have have been in various
 
00:55:30.390 --> 00:55:30.400 align:start position:0%
lines and as an end result overall we
 
00:55:31.510 --> 00:55:31.520 align:start position:0%
have a
 
00:55:35.589 --> 00:55:35.599 align:start position:0%
3.6% increase in our tax base so for
 
00:55:38.630 --> 00:55:38.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
00:55:43.870 --> 00:55:43.880 align:start position:0%
2021 actually we're looking at closer to
 
00:55:48.470 --> 00:55:48.480 align:start position:0%
what our original authorized budget of
 
00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:50.589 align:start position:0%
what our original authorized budget of
1309

00:55:50.589 --> 00:55:50.599 align:start position:0%
1309
 
00:55:53.910 --> 00:55:53.920 align:start position:0%
million so that would go from what you
 
00:55:58.430 --> 00:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
gave us before 128. two that would go up
 
00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:00.870 align:start position:0%
gave us before 128. two that would go up
to

00:56:00.870 --> 00:56:00.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:04.430 --> 00:56:04.440 align:start position:0%
13.9 yes I I currently again we haven't
 
00:56:07.630 --> 00:56:07.640 align:start position:0%
audited all of these uh returns we're
 
00:56:10.190 --> 00:56:10.200 align:start position:0%
still sorting things out and there's a
 
00:56:12.710 --> 00:56:12.720 align:start position:0%
number of
 
00:56:16.829 --> 00:56:16.839 align:start position:0%
uh other factors in the reconciling that
 
00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:19.960 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done yet but at this point
 
00:56:19.960 --> 00:56:20.870 align:start position:0%
hasn't been done yet but at this point
in

00:56:20.870 --> 00:56:20.880 align:start position:0%
in
 
00:56:24.510 --> 00:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
time I'm looking at and this is after we
 
00:56:26.630 --> 00:56:26.640 align:start position:0%
make our transfer to the Department of
 
00:56:29.950 --> 00:56:29.960 align:start position:0%
Health and Human Services approximately
 
00:56:35.789 --> 00:56:35.799 align:start position:0%
131 million for fiscal year 2021 okay
 
00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:36.880 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:56:40.349 --> 00:56:40.359 align:start position:0%
2022 2022 again
 
00:56:44.870 --> 00:56:44.880 align:start position:0%
because the if if all things remain calm
 
00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.000 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:56:49.829 --> 00:56:49.839 align:start position:0%
proove that we should see at least the
 
00:56:53.789 --> 00:56:53.799 align:start position:0%
127 million originally budgeted possibly
 
00:56:56.910 --> 00:56:56.920 align:start position:0%
up to 13 30
 
00:56:56.920 --> 00:56:58.510 align:start position:0%
up to 13 30
million

00:56:58.510 --> 00:56:58.520 align:start position:0%
million
 
00:57:04.710 --> 00:57:04.720 align:start position:0%
2022 so are you going to stick with your
 
00:57:07.309 --> 00:57:07.319 align:start position:0%
127 well again I'll give you the range
 
00:57:10.870 --> 00:57:10.880 align:start position:0%
right now in uh best case scenario would
 
00:57:16.470 --> 00:57:16.480 align:start position:0%
be up to 130 million 127 to 130 okay yes
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
and then on 23 on 23 again our original
 
00:57:25.029 --> 00:57:25.039 align:start position:0%
uh anticipated budget authorized was 13
 
00:57:25.039 --> 00:57:27.549 align:start position:0%
uh anticipated budget authorized was 13
3.3

00:57:27.549 --> 00:57:27.559 align:start position:0%
3.3
 
00:57:31.950 --> 00:57:31.960 align:start position:0%
million I believe it potentially again
 
00:57:34.069 --> 00:57:34.079 align:start position:0%
if everything still continues in this
 
00:57:39.470 --> 00:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
upward Trend it could potentially be 135
 
00:57:42.270 --> 00:57:42.280 align:start position:0%
million so would you
 
00:57:46.270 --> 00:57:46.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:53.630 align:start position:0%
 
133.33

00:57:53.630 --> 00:57:53.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:55.789 --> 00:57:55.799 align:start position:0%
correct okay questions from the
 
00:57:57.990 --> 00:57:58.000 align:start position:0%
committee representative
 
00:58:00.670 --> 00:58:00.680 align:start position:0%
bronley uh thank you Mr chair uh thank
 
00:58:04.549 --> 00:58:04.559 align:start position:0%
you for your testimony um so if we took
 
00:58:08.990 --> 00:58:09.000 align:start position:0%
the midpoint would that be pushing
 
00:58:12.190 --> 00:58:12.200 align:start position:0%
it uh for 22 and
 
00:58:16.150 --> 00:58:16.160 align:start position:0%
23 no that's that that's probably a
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
reasonable best
 
00:58:20.589 --> 00:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
estimate do you feel comfortable that
 
00:58:23.430 --> 00:58:23.440 align:start position:0%
it's probably going to exceed the
 
00:58:25.750 --> 00:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
original numbers
 
00:58:28.910 --> 00:58:28.920 align:start position:0%
well again if if everything
 
00:58:31.510 --> 00:58:31.520 align:start position:0%
continues in the positive
 
00:58:37.190 --> 00:58:37.200 align:start position:0%
trend I would anticipate that what we
 
00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.190 align:start position:0%
trend I would anticipate that what we
had

00:58:39.190 --> 00:58:39.200 align:start position:0%
had
 
00:58:42.910 --> 00:58:42.920 align:start position:0%
projected was was you know very
 
00:58:44.990 --> 00:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
conservative okay that that's very
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:57.589 --> 00:58:57.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:59.789 --> 00:58:59.799 align:start position:0%
speaking of positive
 
00:59:03.510 --> 00:59:03.520 align:start position:0%
Trends the Federal Reserve just came out
 
00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.710 align:start position:0%
Trends the Federal Reserve just came out
this

00:59:04.710 --> 00:59:04.720 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:08.640 align:start position:0%
morning and and Ro and increased their
 
00:59:11.870 --> 00:59:11.880 align:start position:0%
gross domes
 
00:59:15.990 --> 00:59:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
22 and that compares a forecast of 4.2%
 
00:59:30.109 --> 00:59:30.119 align:start position:0%
and 3.2% so they've increased their
 
00:59:34.990 --> 00:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.430 --> 00:59:38.440 align:start position:0%
2122 any further questions of asked to
 
00:59:41.549 --> 00:59:41.559 align:start position:0%
ask of the insurance department see none
 
00:59:43.750 --> 00:59:43.760 align:start position:0%
we thank you for coming
 
00:59:47.309 --> 00:59:47.319 align:start position:0%
in that was easy enough
 
00:59:49.750 --> 00:59:49.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you

the col
 
01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
uh FY 2021 on row s we are still
 
01:02:03.269 --> 01:02:03.279 align:start position:0%
projecting our Revenue estimates at 12
 
01:02:07.390 --> 01:02:07.400 align:start position:0%
129 million which is plan if you go to
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
the column for fy22 and 23 if you look
 
01:02:12.430 --> 01:02:12.440 align:start position:0%
at Row
 
01:02:15.950 --> 01:02:15.960 align:start position:0%
three the general fund transfer our
 
01:02:23.349 --> 01:02:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:27.150 --> 01:02:27.160 align:start position:0%
138.3mm is currently in the plan
 
01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:28.319 align:start position:0%
currently it's
 
01:02:33.069 --> 01:02:33.079 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:37.829 --> 01:02:37.839 align:start position:0%
136.34 million and FY 23 by 2.1
 
01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:40.400 align:start position:0%
million and that's based on our current
 
01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:47.990 align:start position:0%
million and that's based on our current
sales

01:02:47.990 --> 01:02:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.349 --> 01:02:53.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:53.359 --> 01:02:56.230 align:start position:0%
 
committee

01:02:56.230 --> 01:02:56.240 align:start position:0%
committee
 
01:03:00.789 --> 01:03:00.799 align:start position:0%
Norm representative Bry yeah um in our
 
01:03:03.789 --> 01:03:03.799 align:start position:0%
in our on our summary we we had to beer
 
01:03:07.349 --> 01:03:07.359 align:start position:0%
tax at 3.2
 
01:03:10.190 --> 01:03:10.200 align:start position:0%
million yes is that
 
01:03:12.789 --> 01:03:12.799 align:start position:0%
is is that remain it looks like you've
 
01:03:14.349 --> 01:03:14.359 align:start position:0%
lowered it to
 
01:03:18.029 --> 01:03:18.039 align:start position:0%
13.1 uh we had originally projected the
 
01:03:20.870 --> 01:03:20.880 align:start position:0%
13.1 and it was put in plan at the
 
01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:24.960 align:start position:0%
13.2 um the beer tax fluctuat anywhere
 
01:03:30.109 --> 01:03:30.119 align:start position:0%
between like 12.9 and the 13.2 so the
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
13.2 could be
 
01:03:35.029 --> 01:03:35.039 align:start position:0%
attainable it's fairly flat
 
01:03:37.349 --> 01:03:37.359 align:start position:0%
representative as it goes along over the
 
01:03:39.630 --> 01:03:39.640 align:start position:0%
years it doesn't change it doesn't
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
necessarily change a lot it's a couple
 
01:03:44.510 --> 01:03:44.520 align:start position:0%
hundred thousand either way right I
 
01:03:47.069 --> 01:03:47.079 align:start position:0%
understand thank you I I I guess I just
 
01:03:48.950 --> 01:03:48.960 align:start position:0%
saw that change I was trying to
 
01:03:50.470 --> 01:03:50.480 align:start position:0%
understand if it's it's not really that
 
01:03:54.390 --> 01:03:54.400 align:start position:0%
material but um you know I guess guess
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
we just have to decide if we want to use
 
01:03:59.150 --> 01:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
the original 3.2 or the 3.1 that's all
 
01:04:03.230 --> 01:04:03.240 align:start position:0%
it's been pretty flat over the years yep
 
01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.549 align:start position:0%
it's been pretty flat over the years yep
representative

01:04:05.549 --> 01:04:05.559 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:04:09.630 --> 01:04:09.640 align:start position:0%
elme thank you Mr chairman on the
 
01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:13.960 align:start position:0%
granite Advantage transfer um I thought
 
01:04:15.789 --> 01:04:15.799 align:start position:0%
that they were going to come back and
 
01:04:18.910 --> 01:04:18.920 align:start position:0%
ask for more that would have come out of
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
this has that been ruled out or is it
 
01:04:23.190 --> 01:04:23.200 align:start position:0%
just not
 
01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:24.710 align:start position:0%
just not
yet

01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:24.720 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:04:27.549 --> 01:04:27.559 align:start position:0%
and you'll see on uh row six we did
 
01:04:31.630 --> 01:04:31.640 align:start position:0%
transfer that additional 8.5 million so
 
01:04:35.150 --> 01:04:35.160 align:start position:0%
to dat we've transferred 18.5 million
 
01:04:36.470 --> 01:04:36.480 align:start position:0%
they haven't asked for any more
 
01:04:39.230 --> 01:04:39.240 align:start position:0%
additional money other than
 
01:04:41.710 --> 01:04:41.720 align:start position:0%
that thank you so that was an additional
 
01:04:47.029 --> 01:04:47.039 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:50.069 --> 01:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
correct represent
 
01:04:53.470 --> 01:04:53.480 align:start position:0%
Ames um I I'm not sure what your number
 
01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:55.680 align:start position:0%
is for fiscal year 21 what are you
 
01:04:58.990 --> 01:04:59.000 align:start position:0%
showing here for that if you look on row
 
01:05:02.630 --> 01:05:02.640 align:start position:0%
seven it's the we have
 
01:05:06.910 --> 01:05:06.920 align:start position:0%
1285 um in the plan it's 129 so you know
 
01:05:08.750 --> 01:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
the 129 is
 
01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:12.150 align:start position:0%
the 129 is
reasonable

01:05:12.150 --> 01:05:12.160 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.069 --> 01:05:23.079 align:start position:0%
you and 138 point3 for
 
01:05:25.390 --> 01:05:25.400 align:start position:0%
22 that's
 
01:05:31.630 --> 01:05:31.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:31.640 --> 01:05:34.190 align:start position:0%
 
1384

01:05:34.190 --> 01:05:34.200 align:start position:0%
1384
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
23 Mr
 
01:05:40.269 --> 01:05:40.279 align:start position:0%
chairman represent El me I have another
 
01:05:44.630 --> 01:05:44.640 align:start position:0%
question now um
 
01:05:48.829 --> 01:05:48.839 align:start position:0%
$1,500,000 has been taken out of their
 
01:05:52.069 --> 01:05:52.079 align:start position:0%
profits uh for granite Advantage this
 
01:05:54.589 --> 01:05:54.599 align:start position:0%
year and
 
01:06:00.309 --> 01:06:00.319 align:start position:0%
that means that there's about um that
 
01:06:05.630 --> 01:06:05.640 align:start position:0%
their higher numbers for 22 and 23 are
 
01:06:08.990 --> 01:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
actually about $8 million short of what
 
01:06:14.309 --> 01:06:14.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:17.720 align:start position:0%
so well you'll see the fy22 and 23
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
numbers are based on the law of the 5%
 
01:06:25.069 --> 01:06:25.079 align:start position:0%
that we have to transfer of gross profit
 
01:06:27.230 --> 01:06:27.240 align:start position:0%
it doesn't include any additional funds
 
01:06:29.430 --> 01:06:29.440 align:start position:0%
that they might need for the granted
 
01:06:30.829 --> 01:06:30.839 align:start position:0%
Advantage because we won't know for
 
01:06:33.789 --> 01:06:33.799 align:start position:0%
those years so if you look down on um
 
01:06:37.029 --> 01:06:37.039 align:start position:0%
row seven you'll see that our transfer
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
for fy22 is $8 million higher than our
 
01:06:41.160 --> 01:06:43.710 align:start position:0%
for fy22 is $8 million higher than our
fy21

01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:43.720 align:start position:0%
fy21
 
01:06:46.789 --> 01:06:46.799 align:start position:0%
number so if I could could ask to
 
01:06:50.029 --> 01:06:50.039 align:start position:0%
clarify so it is in the permanent
 
01:06:52.470 --> 01:06:52.480 align:start position:0%
statutes that you're going to be
 
01:06:55.349 --> 01:06:55.359 align:start position:0%
transferring 5% of your profits to
 
01:06:58.990 --> 01:06:59.000 align:start position:0%
granted advantage that's correct
 
01:07:02.309 --> 01:07:02.319 align:start position:0%
representative thank you you're
 
01:07:12.990 --> 01:07:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:14.990 --> 01:07:15.000 align:start position:0%
commissioner all
 
01:07:17.470 --> 01:07:17.480 align:start position:0%
right so
 
01:07:22.910 --> 01:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
then for 21 it's 28.5 million for liquor
 
01:07:29.530 --> 01:07:29.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:52.910 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

01:07:52.910 --> 01:07:52.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:55.789 --> 01:07:55.799 align:start position:0%
138.3mm yes sir that's correct Mr
 
01:07:58.910 --> 01:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
chairman all right I see no further hand
 
01:08:07.990 --> 01:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.829 align:start position:0%
 
128.57

01:08:10.829 --> 01:08:10.839 align:start position:0%
128.57
 
01:08:13.589 --> 01:08:13.599 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:08:16.269 --> 01:08:16.279 align:start position:0%
commission right that's correct we said
 
01:08:17.309 --> 01:08:17.319 align:start position:0%
that the
 
01:08:22.590 --> 01:08:22.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:26.430 --> 01:08:26.440 align:start position:0%
attainable it's very hard to
 
01:08:30.510 --> 01:08:30.520 align:start position:0%
you the 129 that's currently in plan we
 
01:08:32.430 --> 01:08:32.440 align:start position:0%
said was
 
01:08:40.390 --> 01:08:40.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:43.590 --> 01:08:43.600 align:start position:0%
128.57 point5 but we said that the the
 
01:08:48.070 --> 01:08:48.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.789 --> 01:08:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:52.799 --> 01:08:58.990 align:start position:0%
 
minute

01:08:58.990 --> 01:08:59.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:04.229 --> 01:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
so your line is not your plan is that
 
01:09:12.669 --> 01:09:12.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:16.749 --> 01:09:16.759 align:start position:0%
you can you am I the only one having
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
problems hearing oh no it's very hard to
 
01:09:24.709 --> 01:09:24.719 align:start position:0%
hear we need to have uh they're saying
 
01:09:29.110 --> 01:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
is that on the they can live with the
 
01:09:38.829 --> 01:09:38.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.590 --> 01:09:41.600 align:start position:0%
estimate now on
 
01:09:45.149 --> 01:09:45.159 align:start position:0%
22 you going to live with the 1366 or go
 
01:09:45.159 --> 01:09:46.030 align:start position:0%
22 you going to live with the 1366 or go
to

01:09:46.030 --> 01:09:46.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:09:46.040 --> 01:09:47.870 align:start position:0%
to
1383

01:09:47.870 --> 01:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
1383
 
01:09:52.149 --> 01:09:52.159 align:start position:0%
1383 yeah okay and then on
 
01:09:54.750 --> 01:09:54.760 align:start position:0%
23 the same thing say you're going to go
 
01:09:54.760 --> 01:09:56.350 align:start position:0%
23 the same thing say you're going to go
to

01:09:56.350 --> 01:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:00.040 align:start position:0%
1384 correct
 
01:10:06.030 --> 01:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
okay hey we are in syn now that's good
 
01:10:08.229 --> 01:10:08.239 align:start position:0%

01:10:11.750 --> 01:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
questions thank you we're coming
 
01:10:15.590 --> 01:10:15.600 align:start position:0%
in thank you Mr chairman Chris what do
 
01:10:18.750 --> 01:10:18.760 align:start position:0%

01:10:23.229 --> 01:10:23.239 align:start position:0%
coming in uh not for ND related revenues
 
01:10:25.590 --> 01:10:25.600 align:start position:0%
um you do the Dr on the call ready to
 
01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:28.400 align:start position:0%
address any questions you might have um
 
01:10:29.950 --> 01:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
related to House Bill two or the
 
01:10:33.310 --> 01:10:33.320 align:start position:0%
revenues you discussed yesterday um
 
01:10:34.790 --> 01:10:34.800 align:start position:0%
however you want to
 
01:10:38.149 --> 01:10:38.159 align:start position:0%
proceed I want to proceed with the
 
01:10:41.350 --> 01:10:41.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:47.830 --> 01:10:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:51.510 --> 01:10:51.520 align:start position:0%
Dr if they could go over that
 
01:10:58.229 --> 01:10:58.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:01.070 --> 01:11:01.080 align:start position:0%
reference their March
 
01:11:06.350 --> 01:11:06.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:10.030 --> 01:11:10.040 align:start position:0%
estimates if they would go through and
 
01:11:15.149 --> 01:11:15.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:18.390 --> 01:11:18.400 align:start position:0%
again there's two types of
 
01:11:22.550 --> 01:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
abnormalities associated with
 
01:11:29.470 --> 01:11:29.480 align:start position:0%
21 one is that caused by the uh feds in
 
01:11:31.750 --> 01:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
the state moving their collection of
 
01:11:34.470 --> 01:11:34.480 align:start position:0%
taxes last
 
01:11:37.390 --> 01:11:37.400 align:start position:0%
year and that resulted in the business
 
01:11:39.709 --> 01:11:39.719 align:start position:0%
taxes of 18.3
 
01:11:39.719 --> 01:11:41.550 align:start position:0%
taxes of 18.3
million

01:11:41.550 --> 01:11:41.560 align:start position:0%
million
 
01:11:45.990 --> 01:11:46.000 align:start position:0%
as tributed to
 
01:11:50.870 --> 01:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
2020 and then this year there was a $10
 
01:11:55.470 --> 01:11:55.480 align:start position:0%
million other one time
 
01:11:57.590 --> 01:11:57.600 align:start position:0%
event now the
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
18 the
 
01:12:02.950 --> 01:12:02.960 align:start position:0%
817 million has
 
01:12:06.470 --> 01:12:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:11.030 --> 01:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
fy21 that is clear of any
 
01:12:14.950 --> 01:12:14.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:17.229 --> 01:12:17.239 align:start position:0%
question good morning Mr chair members
 
01:12:18.750 --> 01:12:18.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record Melissa
 
01:12:20.430 --> 01:12:20.440 align:start position:0%
Rollins senior Financial Analyst at
 
01:12:21.990 --> 01:12:22.000 align:start position:0%
Department of
 
01:12:26.629 --> 01:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
Revenue so the 817 and
 
01:12:30.590 --> 01:12:30.600 align:start position:0%
841 is net of the fiscal year 21
 
01:12:35.550 --> 01:12:35.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:39.910 --> 01:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
million it is not net of the 10
 
01:12:43.870 --> 01:12:43.880 align:start position:0%
million of anomalous tax notice payments
 
01:12:52.430 --> 01:12:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:54.590 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:12:54.590 --> 01:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:12:59.709 --> 01:12:59.719 align:start position:0%
so when we go from U 21 to 22 we have to
 
01:13:02.790 --> 01:13:02.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:07.310 --> 01:13:07.320 align:start position:0%
million and and the base would be
 
01:13:12.270 --> 01:13:12.280 align:start position:0%
807 no the low
 
01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.229 align:start position:0%
807 no the low
and

01:13:14.229 --> 01:13:14.239 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:13:16.430 --> 01:13:16.440 align:start position:0%
831 for the
 
01:13:19.510 --> 01:13:19.520 align:start position:0%
high is that correct that's correct when
 
01:13:28.910 --> 01:13:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:31.709 --> 01:13:31.719 align:start position:0%
okay so you want to keep that 10 million
 
01:13:34.310 --> 01:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
in 21 because we did receive that pay
 
01:13:36.750 --> 01:13:36.760 align:start position:0%
those payments but you want to remove it
 
01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:38.800 align:start position:0%
when growing to 22 because we don't
 
01:13:41.709 --> 01:13:41.719 align:start position:0%
anticipate seeing that those $10 million
 
01:13:43.629 --> 01:13:43.639 align:start position:0%
payments again in
 
01:13:47.390 --> 01:13:47.400 align:start position:0%
22 okay represent major this is Chris
 
01:13:49.070 --> 01:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
would you like me to share that document
 
01:13:52.350 --> 01:13:52.360 align:start position:0%
so everybody in the committee can see it
 
01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:56.189 align:start position:0%
so everybody in the committee can see it
please

01:13:56.189 --> 01:13:56.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:57.709 --> 01:13:57.719 align:start position:0%
it's nice to
 
01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:00.600 align:start position:0%
have great people around knowing what
 
01:14:02.390 --> 01:14:02.400 align:start position:0%
needs to be
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
done so you should you should see the
 
01:14:08.550 --> 01:14:08.560 align:start position:0%
document now and in the note up above
 
01:14:11.870 --> 01:14:11.880 align:start position:0%
you you do see that the Dr does discuss
 
01:14:15.110 --> 01:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
removing the 10 million from the 817 and
 
01:14:19.030 --> 01:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
the 841 when growing it for 22 and
 
01:14:21.430 --> 01:14:21.440 align:start position:0%
23 and the
 
01:14:26.110 --> 01:14:26.120 align:start position:0%
18.3 does not show up the 817 it's been
 
01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:36.629 --> 01:14:36.639 align:start position:0%
yeah Mr
 
01:14:41.229 --> 01:14:41.239 align:start position:0%
chairman yes represent could I ask Chris
 
01:14:44.709 --> 01:14:44.719 align:start position:0%
do we I can't remember do we have to put
 
01:14:51.790 --> 01:14:51.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:55.030 --> 01:14:55.040 align:start position:0%
hr12 uh no no you you remove that from
 
01:14:56.709 --> 01:14:56.719 align:start position:0%
your house
 
01:14:58.790 --> 01:14:58.800 align:start position:0%
resolution because it's it's money
 
01:15:00.510 --> 01:15:00.520 align:start position:0%
that's going to be credited back to
 
01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 20 but because we're on a
 
01:15:04.790 --> 01:15:04.800 align:start position:0%
cash basis you see it in the reports
 
01:15:07.270 --> 01:15:07.280 align:start position:0%
that come out currently but at the end
 
01:15:09.149 --> 01:15:09.159 align:start position:0%
of the year it will be reconciled and it
 
01:15:12.510 --> 01:15:12.520 align:start position:0%
won't be in the final revenues for for
 
01:15:15.070 --> 01:15:15.080 align:start position:0%
21 thank you so it's correct to to
 
01:15:18.070 --> 01:15:18.080 align:start position:0%
remove it now in your in your work and
 
01:15:19.510 --> 01:15:19.520 align:start position:0%
that's what Dr has done in their
 
01:15:21.030 --> 01:15:21.040 align:start position:0%
estimates for us is they' they've
 
01:15:24.310 --> 01:15:24.320 align:start position:0%
removed those that total of .8 million
 
01:15:26.910 --> 01:15:26.920 align:start position:0%
in those Revenue sources that had that
 
01:15:29.629 --> 01:15:29.639 align:start position:0%
um anomalous receivables that came in 21
 
01:15:31.669 --> 01:15:31.679 align:start position:0%
that should have been done in 20 fiscal
 
01:15:31.679 --> 01:15:33.510 align:start position:0%
that should have been done in 20 fiscal
year

01:15:33.510 --> 01:15:33.520 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:15:36.229 --> 01:15:36.239 align:start position:0%
20 hopefully that answers and if uh
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
Melissa or anybody else needs to jump in
 
01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:40.719 align:start position:0%
and clarify even more I I'll defer to
 
01:15:42.830 --> 01:15:42.840 align:start position:0%
them I think you hit it on the head
 
01:15:46.390 --> 01:15:46.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:50.510 --> 01:15:50.520 align:start position:0%
Melissa so for fisal year
 
01:15:53.990 --> 01:15:54.000 align:start position:0%
21 the gr has
 
01:15:58.390 --> 01:15:58.400 align:start position:0%
817 for their low which includes the 10
 
01:16:01.950 --> 01:16:01.960 align:start position:0%
million and 841 for their High which
 
01:16:06.910 --> 01:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
includes the 10 million but as we go
 
01:16:12.310 --> 01:16:12.320 align:start position:0%
from 21 to 22 we remove that 10 million
 
01:16:14.790 --> 01:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
on both the low and the high to project
 
01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:22.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:25.590 align:start position:0%
 
2022

01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.629 --> 01:16:28.639 align:start position:0%
is that clear with
 
01:16:31.149 --> 01:16:31.159 align:start position:0%
everybody questions representative
 
01:16:34.229 --> 01:16:34.239 align:start position:0%
browny yeah I just want to say that uh
 
01:16:36.669 --> 01:16:36.679 align:start position:0%
the revenue Focus has been footnoting
 
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
all of these over the last couple of
 
01:16:42.510 --> 01:16:42.520 align:start position:0%
months allthough the an anomalous um
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue so it's pretty clear that it's
 
01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
going to go back to the last year's
 
01:16:51.189 --> 01:16:51.199 align:start position:0%
numbers and uh I think most of us now
 
01:16:53.910 --> 01:16:53.920 align:start position:0%
that we've clarified this I think the
 
01:16:55.550 --> 01:16:55.560 align:start position:0%
numbers when you look at the whole
 
01:16:57.110 --> 01:16:57.120 align:start position:0%
numbers not the percentage increases or
 
01:16:59.750 --> 01:16:59.760 align:start position:0%
anything like that that these numbers
 
01:17:03.270 --> 01:17:03.280 align:start position:0%
are are accurate from the Dr uh
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
hopefully everybody had the same
 
01:17:09.430 --> 01:17:09.440 align:start position:0%
understanding as was within this report
 
01:17:11.070 --> 01:17:11.080 align:start position:0%
because we did a lot of work already in
 
01:17:13.350 --> 01:17:13.360 align:start position:0%
estimating and I just I just want to get
 
01:17:16.669 --> 01:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
a sense that is anything changed here
 
01:17:19.590 --> 01:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
that would change anybody's mind on the
 
01:17:22.229 --> 01:17:22.239 align:start position:0%
estimate that they came up with so
 
01:17:23.750 --> 01:17:23.760 align:start position:0%
that's just a general question
 
01:17:26.990 --> 01:17:27.000 align:start position:0%
question uh but it didn't change my mind
 
01:17:30.030 --> 01:17:30.040 align:start position:0%
I think I think I use what the DR had
 
01:17:32.510 --> 01:17:32.520 align:start position:0%
here and now we just reverified that
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
it's yes it's
 
01:17:38.750 --> 01:17:38.760 align:start position:0%
accurate um so hopefully others feel the
 
01:17:42.910 --> 01:17:42.920 align:start position:0%
same way okay representative
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
Bernstein thank you Mr chair
 
01:17:48.830 --> 01:17:48.840 align:start position:0%
representative Amy just referenced
 
01:17:51.990 --> 01:17:52.000 align:start position:0%
hr12 and I thought we were working on
 
01:17:57.310 --> 01:17:57.320 align:start position:0%
hr11 is hr12 a new iteration of hr1 oh I
 
01:17:59.950 --> 01:17:59.960 align:start position:0%
I beg pardon I couldn't
 
01:18:02.870 --> 01:18:02.880 align:start position:0%
remember got it so it's just hr11 which
 
01:18:04.470 --> 01:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
is on the table right now and we're
 
01:18:06.310 --> 01:18:06.320 align:start position:0%
going to bring that off the table for a
 
01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:09.320 align:start position:0%
new resolution once we complete our
 
01:18:11.950 --> 01:18:11.960 align:start position:0%
es and to let you know what's really
 
01:18:14.750 --> 01:18:14.760 align:start position:0%
going to happen we're working like we're
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
going to come up and and amend
 
01:18:21.910 --> 01:18:21.920 align:start position:0%
hr11 but
 
01:18:25.310 --> 01:18:25.320 align:start position:0%
since we won't be
 
01:18:28.550 --> 01:18:28.560 align:start position:0%
meeting as a as the house group until
 
01:18:31.870 --> 01:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
April we need to transfer our Revenue
 
01:18:35.830 --> 01:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
estimates to finance like
 
01:18:38.990 --> 01:18:39.000 align:start position:0%
tomorrow and so we need to
 
01:18:42.550 --> 01:18:42.560 align:start position:0%
um come up with our best projections
 
01:18:44.830 --> 01:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
with what we know at this point in time
 
01:18:47.950 --> 01:18:47.960 align:start position:0%
to give the finance knowing that the
 
01:18:51.709 --> 01:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
heavy months of March is not over and
 
01:18:53.629 --> 01:18:53.639 align:start position:0%
the heavy month of April April hasn't
 
01:18:57.310 --> 01:18:57.320 align:start position:0%
happened yet
 
01:19:01.310 --> 01:19:01.320 align:start position:0%
we'll probably change the estimates and
 
01:19:02.669 --> 01:19:02.679 align:start position:0%
we're going to go through the same
 
01:19:05.830 --> 01:19:05.840 align:start position:0%
process again towards the end of
 
01:19:08.390 --> 01:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
April I appreciate the clarification
 
01:19:08.400 --> 01:19:09.310 align:start position:0%
April I appreciate the clarification
thank

01:19:09.310 --> 01:19:09.320 align:start position:0%
thank
 
01:19:12.590 --> 01:19:12.600 align:start position:0%
you Mr chairman yes
 
01:19:16.430 --> 01:19:16.440 align:start position:0%
representative I would hope that we
 
01:19:20.430 --> 01:19:20.440 align:start position:0%
would find a way you would find a way to
 
01:19:23.709 --> 01:19:23.719 align:start position:0%
uh present the revenue estimate
 
01:19:27.629 --> 01:19:27.639 align:start position:0%
um before the budget was presented on
 
01:19:33.390 --> 01:19:33.400 align:start position:0%
the 6th or sth 7th of of April so that
 
01:19:36.470 --> 01:19:36.480 align:start position:0%
on we would have a fig Leaf left of the
 
01:19:39.390 --> 01:19:39.400 align:start position:0%
tradition that that has been driving the
 
01:19:42.350 --> 01:19:42.360 align:start position:0%
revenue estimate going into the
 
01:19:46.270 --> 01:19:46.280 align:start position:0%
budget yeah at the point in time that we
 
01:19:50.189 --> 01:19:50.199 align:start position:0%
have when we meet again in April we
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
should have a
 
01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:54.669 align:start position:0%
should have a
resolution

01:19:54.669 --> 01:19:54.679 align:start position:0%
resolution
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
and then that and then may will be
 
01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:57.910 align:start position:0%
and then that and then may will be
reading

01:19:57.910 --> 01:19:57.920 align:start position:0%
reading
 
01:20:01.390 --> 01:20:01.400 align:start position:0%
again and and we'll be meeting again in
 
01:20:07.149 --> 01:20:07.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:10.990 --> 01:20:11.000 align:start position:0%
conference uh represented
 
01:20:14.470 --> 01:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
ases okay um Mr chair is this the time
 
01:20:20.110 --> 01:20:20.120 align:start position:0%
to examine this this uh estimate for
 
01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:29.080 align:start position:0%
21 uh yes yes it is okay you right
 
01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
here yeah so what I guess I want to say
 
01:20:36.189 --> 01:20:36.199 align:start position:0%
first that
 
01:20:39.510 --> 01:20:39.520 align:start position:0%
I um I've come up with quite a different
 
01:20:42.790 --> 01:20:42.800 align:start position:0%
number than Dr so I'll give you my
 
01:20:45.390 --> 01:20:45.400 align:start position:0%
bottom line and then
 
01:20:48.990 --> 01:20:49.000 align:start position:0%
explain um if I
 
01:20:53.430 --> 01:20:53.440 align:start position:0%
may go ahead your Nam Okay so
 
01:20:56.149 --> 01:20:56.159 align:start position:0%
my bottom line when I go through the
 
01:20:58.709 --> 01:20:58.719 align:start position:0%
calculations that I'm going to take you
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
through um takes me to 845 million for
 
01:21:10.270 --> 01:21:10.280 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 okay all right so how do
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
I get there um February
 
01:21:17.110 --> 01:21:17.120 align:start position:0%
collections before removing the
 
01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:26.830 --> 01:21:26.840 align:start position:0%
chis that's uh in the uh monthly report
 
01:21:29.990 --> 01:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
that Chris sends to us of
 
01:21:33.470 --> 01:21:33.480 align:start position:0%
collections um that does not have the
 
01:21:38.270 --> 01:21:38.280 align:start position:0%
18.3 removed so I removed that and my
 
01:21:41.750 --> 01:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
number after February starting the
 
01:21:51.629 --> 01:21:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
$45.39 now at March 18th and thanks to
 
01:22:01.350 --> 01:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
dr's uh quickness on this uh we have the
 
01:22:04.110 --> 01:22:04.120 align:start position:0%
money that has been collected as well as
 
01:22:04.120 --> 01:22:04.910 align:start position:0%
money that has been collected as well as
the

01:22:04.910 --> 01:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:09.709 --> 01:22:09.719 align:start position:0%
refunds um through to through this
 
01:22:13.229 --> 01:22:13.239 align:start position:0%
state and those collections are
 
01:22:13.239 --> 01:22:14.910 align:start position:0%
state and those collections are
surprisingly

01:22:14.910 --> 01:22:14.920 align:start position:0%
surprisingly
 
01:22:16.870 --> 01:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
High um
 
01:22:20.590 --> 01:22:20.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.390 --> 01:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
18th the total
 
01:22:29.149 --> 01:22:29.159 align:start position:0%
collections reported are amount to $11.2
 
01:22:32.430 --> 01:22:32.440 align:start position:0%
million the only the the refunds have
 
01:22:34.830 --> 01:22:34.840 align:start position:0%
been very limited
 
01:22:39.830 --> 01:22:39.840 align:start position:0%
0.9 so the net collected so far is $1.3
 
01:22:43.430 --> 01:22:43.440 align:start position:0%
million it's a lot of money
 
01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:48.840 align:start position:0%
um then we have from the um from the
 
01:22:52.189 --> 01:22:52.199 align:start position:0%
same report that Dr sends out the amount
 
01:22:55.030 --> 01:22:55.040 align:start position:0%
that has has been collected um in
 
01:22:58.790 --> 01:22:58.800 align:start position:0%
previous years well last year as the Dr
 
01:23:02.189 --> 01:23:02.199 align:start position:0%
report shows last year's collections for
 
01:23:04.470 --> 01:23:04.480 align:start position:0%
the remaining days of
 
01:23:08.550 --> 01:23:08.560 align:start position:0%
March so just last year this was just as
 
01:23:10.510 --> 01:23:10.520 align:start position:0%
the pandemic was hitting by the way and
 
01:23:13.229 --> 01:23:13.239 align:start position:0%
these are most significantly the
 
01:23:15.310 --> 01:23:15.320 align:start position:0%
Partnerships that are
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
filing um for those remaining days in
 
01:23:22.629 --> 01:23:22.639 align:start position:0%
March uh another $23 million came in
 
01:23:22.639 --> 01:23:24.070 align:start position:0%
March uh another $23 million came in
last

01:23:24.070 --> 01:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
last
 
01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:29.120 align:start position:0%
year if you take the 100 100.3 that has
 
01:23:32.270 --> 01:23:32.280 align:start position:0%
that's already in hand for March and you
 
01:23:35.350 --> 01:23:35.360 align:start position:0%
and to be uh optimistic you put in the
 
01:23:38.870 --> 01:23:38.880 align:start position:0%
entire 23 that was received last year
 
01:23:40.990 --> 01:23:41.000 align:start position:0%
for these remaining days you get for
 
01:23:44.310 --> 01:23:44.320 align:start position:0%
March $123
 
01:23:49.189 --> 01:23:49.199 align:start position:0%
million so I add $123 to the
 
01:23:53.709 --> 01:23:53.719 align:start position:0%
445 that uh is the post February period
 
01:23:55.790 --> 01:23:55.800 align:start position:0%
amount and I get $
 
01:23:59.590 --> 01:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
5683 million so the question now is what
 
01:24:02.950 --> 01:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
about April May and June um we obviously
 
01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:07.000 align:start position:0%
have no nothing uh that's current for
 
01:24:09.390 --> 01:24:09.400 align:start position:0%
this year until it's till we get into
 
01:24:13.229 --> 01:24:13.239 align:start position:0%
those months um looking back Beyond we
 
01:24:15.310 --> 01:24:15.320 align:start position:0%
have to look back Beyond last year
 
01:24:19.070 --> 01:24:19.080 align:start position:0%
because now we're into Co and the defer
 
01:24:21.950 --> 01:24:21.960 align:start position:0%
delays of uh tax reporting and all the
 
01:24:24.270 --> 01:24:24.280 align:start position:0%
other things that happened but for the
 
01:24:27.870 --> 01:24:27.880 align:start position:0%
previous two years um for those three
 
01:24:33.229 --> 01:24:33.239 align:start position:0%
months added together 2019 it was $292
 
01:24:37.430 --> 01:24:37.440 align:start position:0%
Million 20 2018 it was $311
 
01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:40.960 align:start position:0%
Million if you average that you get
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
301 and if you add the 301 to the
 
01:24:52.350 --> 01:24:52.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:55.709 --> 01:24:55.719 align:start position:0%
started this that I'm putting in 845 so
 
01:24:59.350 --> 01:24:59.360 align:start position:0%
I'm discounting to be uh on the side of
 
01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:03.960 align:start position:0%
caution um and I know that uh we don't
 
01:25:05.750 --> 01:25:05.760 align:start position:0%
know what's going to happen in April May
 
01:25:09.910 --> 01:25:09.920 align:start position:0%
and June but I do know and we all know
 
01:25:13.830 --> 01:25:13.840 align:start position:0%
that uh the uh business returns payments
 
01:25:18.070 --> 01:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
revenues have been remarkably good and
 
01:25:20.669 --> 01:25:20.679 align:start position:0%
particularly um as we've added these
 
01:25:23.669 --> 01:25:23.679 align:start position:0%
critical months of February March April
 
01:25:27.830 --> 01:25:27.840 align:start position:0%
May and June um so I think
 
01:25:31.470 --> 01:25:31.480 align:start position:0%
845 is a conservative
 
01:25:35.750 --> 01:25:35.760 align:start position:0%
number um and to State the obvious
 
01:25:38.750 --> 01:25:38.760 align:start position:0%
there's some level of uh uncertainty
 
01:25:40.830 --> 01:25:40.840 align:start position:0%
about it I also want to say one other
 
01:25:45.310 --> 01:25:45.320 align:start position:0%
thing I know that the uh uh back in 2019
 
01:25:48.709 --> 01:25:48.719 align:start position:0%
and 2018 there were anomalous payments
 
01:25:50.510 --> 01:25:50.520 align:start position:0%
received although most of the big
 
01:25:53.070 --> 01:25:53.080 align:start position:0%
anomalous payments came in
 
01:25:55.149 --> 01:25:55.159 align:start position:0%
um in the earlier months and remember
 
01:25:58.270 --> 01:25:58.280 align:start position:0%
we're just looking at the months um but
 
01:26:02.669 --> 01:26:02.679 align:start position:0%
I also know that we have uh enacted into
 
01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
our law um a number of changes to the
 
01:26:06.960 --> 01:26:07.910 align:start position:0%
our law um a number of changes to the
business

01:26:07.910 --> 01:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
business
 
01:26:10.870 --> 01:26:10.880 align:start position:0%
tax um that have enhanced our
 
01:26:12.590 --> 01:26:12.600 align:start position:0%
collections at least that's what we
 
01:26:14.430 --> 01:26:14.440 align:start position:0%
expected we have conformed to the
 
01:26:17.510 --> 01:26:17.520 align:start position:0%
federal tax code in several particulars
 
01:26:20.830 --> 01:26:20.840 align:start position:0%
that uh we predicted would increase our
 
01:26:22.910 --> 01:26:22.920 align:start position:0%
our our collections
 
01:26:25.229 --> 01:26:25.239 align:start position:0%
and uh we also
 
01:26:25.239 --> 01:26:27.550 align:start position:0%
and uh we also
um

01:26:27.550 --> 01:26:27.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:30.109 --> 01:26:30.119 align:start position:0%
um well those are the main things I I
 
01:26:32.590 --> 01:26:32.600 align:start position:0%
guess I should emphasize so that's
 
01:26:34.430 --> 01:26:34.440 align:start position:0%
that's what I wanted to
 
01:26:37.470 --> 01:26:37.480 align:start position:0%
say thank
 
01:26:40.350 --> 01:26:40.360 align:start position:0%
you rep representative
 
01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:43.080 align:start position:0%
Bron yeah thank you representative Ames
 
01:26:45.350 --> 01:26:45.360 align:start position:0%
I followed your logic there the the one
 
01:26:47.470 --> 01:26:47.480 align:start position:0%
question though that I have and maybe
 
01:26:48.830 --> 01:26:48.840 align:start position:0%
this is also for the
 
01:26:53.030 --> 01:26:53.040 align:start position:0%
Dr is we're comparing uh runner rates
 
01:26:54.149 --> 01:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
here on this
 
01:26:58.270 --> 01:26:58.280 align:start position:0%
report uh what we don't know is is
 
01:27:01.390 --> 01:27:01.400 align:start position:0%
whether 2000 uh
 
01:27:01.400 --> 01:27:03.149 align:start position:0%
whether 2000 uh
whether

01:27:03.149 --> 01:27:03.159 align:start position:0%
whether
 
01:27:05.750 --> 01:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
uh March of
 
01:27:08.870 --> 01:27:08.880 align:start position:0%
2020 was running below
 
01:27:12.189 --> 01:27:12.199 align:start position:0%
budget is any is anybody on from Darry
 
01:27:14.830 --> 01:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
or uh from or maybe Chris I don't have
 
01:27:16.030 --> 01:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
that right in front of
 
01:27:16.040 --> 01:27:17.870 align:start position:0%
that right in front of
me

01:27:17.870 --> 01:27:17.880 align:start position:0%
me
 
01:27:19.790 --> 01:27:19.800 align:start position:0%
um we're we're we're we're just
 
01:27:22.510 --> 01:27:22.520 align:start position:0%
comparing run rates but we don't know if
 
01:27:26.109 --> 01:27:26.119 align:start position:0%
last year's Runway rate was good or bad
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:34.510 --> 01:27:34.520 align:start position:0%
pandemic Melissa can you respond to
 
01:27:38.390 --> 01:27:38.400 align:start position:0%
that sure so I just pulled up the March
 
01:27:42.669 --> 01:27:42.679 align:start position:0%
Revenue Focus for last year just to make
 
01:27:44.750 --> 01:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
sure we're on the same page um and it
 
01:27:47.790 --> 01:27:47.800 align:start position:0%
looks like business taxes ended
 
01:27:53.270 --> 01:27:53.280 align:start position:0%
17.5 million below plan
 
01:27:56.669 --> 01:27:56.679 align:start position:0%
and I I think that's primarily due to
 
01:27:58.870 --> 01:27:58.880 align:start position:0%
the shift in due date so if you remember
 
01:28:02.590 --> 01:28:02.600 align:start position:0%
last year um actually the 18.3 million
 
01:28:03.830 --> 01:28:03.840 align:start position:0%
that we were just talking about last
 
01:28:06.430 --> 01:28:06.440 align:start position:0%
year the due date was shifted from March
 
01:28:10.550 --> 01:28:10.560 align:start position:0%
and April into June um and then we know
 
01:28:12.550 --> 01:28:12.560 align:start position:0%
that taxpayers ended up paying in July
 
01:28:14.030 --> 01:28:14.040 align:start position:0%
which was the Federal due date which is
 
01:28:16.350 --> 01:28:16.360 align:start position:0%
that 18.3 million of anomalous
 
01:28:19.229 --> 01:28:19.239 align:start position:0%
receivable that got tossed back into
 
01:28:19.239 --> 01:28:20.750 align:start position:0%
receivable that got tossed back into
20

01:28:20.750 --> 01:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:28:26.229 --> 01:28:26.239 align:start position:0%
so if it wasn't all of that the the
 
01:28:31.750 --> 01:28:31.760 align:start position:0%
1029 would probably be 17.5 million more
 
01:28:35.590 --> 01:28:35.600 align:start position:0%
when I look at the the end of the
 
01:28:38.430 --> 01:28:38.440 align:start position:0%
so so what you're saying is it really
 
01:28:42.750 --> 01:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:46.750 --> 01:28:46.760 align:start position:0%
I which I think that says something I I
 
01:28:48.669 --> 01:28:48.679 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
01:28:51.430 --> 01:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
um that I I I agree with you the
 
01:28:52.950 --> 01:28:52.960 align:start position:0%
revenues look look
 
01:28:56.709 --> 01:28:56.719 align:start position:0%
good but when you compare it against
 
01:28:59.629 --> 01:28:59.639 align:start position:0%
what March budget was well it doesn't
 
01:29:00.830 --> 01:29:00.840 align:start position:0%
look as
 
01:29:04.070 --> 01:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
good is my only
 
01:29:07.750 --> 01:29:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:14.109 --> 01:29:14.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:18.550 --> 01:29:18.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:23.590 --> 01:29:23.600 align:start position:0%
um we have the Dr
 
01:29:27.149 --> 01:29:27.159 align:start position:0%
their high would be
 
01:29:30.350 --> 01:29:30.360 align:start position:0%
841 and their low is
 
01:29:36.750 --> 01:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:41.310 --> 01:29:41.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:45.870 --> 01:29:45.880 align:start position:0%
second contains that $10 million right
 
01:29:48.270 --> 01:29:48.280 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:29:50.910 --> 01:29:50.920 align:start position:0%
Melissa that's
 
01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.990 align:start position:0%
Melissa that's
correct

01:29:52.990 --> 01:29:53.000 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:29:54.990 --> 01:29:55.000 align:start position:0%
and what you're saying representative
 
01:29:58.270 --> 01:29:58.280 align:start position:0%
Ames your analysis shows
 
01:30:01.109 --> 01:30:01.119 align:start position:0%
that uh what is your height because you
 
01:30:03.510 --> 01:30:03.520 align:start position:0%
came out of
 
01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:08.480 align:start position:0%
145 I mean four 845 what is your yeah
 
01:30:12.189 --> 01:30:12.199 align:start position:0%
that's a good question I so my 845 is 3
 
01:30:14.669 --> 01:30:14.679 align:start position:0%
million below what I'm
 
01:30:19.030 --> 01:30:19.040 align:start position:0%
seeing or is it let's see no it's it's
 
01:30:21.550 --> 01:30:21.560 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's significantly wait a
 
01:30:21.560 --> 01:30:22.550 align:start position:0%
it's it's it's significantly wait a
minute

01:30:22.550 --> 01:30:22.560 align:start position:0%
minute
 
01:30:25.310 --> 01:30:25.320 align:start position:0%
I am looking at the wrong numbers so the
 
01:30:32.750 --> 01:30:32.760 align:start position:0%
high that uh of 841 is what Dr has right
 
01:30:35.229 --> 01:30:35.239 align:start position:0%
and mine is 845 so there's not much
 
01:30:40.109 --> 01:30:40.119 align:start position:0%
difference so your 845 is is your high
 
01:30:43.910 --> 01:30:43.920 align:start position:0%
it is my number yeah I I could go higher
 
01:30:47.390 --> 01:30:47.400 align:start position:0%
given that I seem to have by my by this
 
01:30:50.830 --> 01:30:50.840 align:start position:0%
mathematical calculation I
 
01:30:53.870 --> 01:30:53.880 align:start position:0%
uh there's a basis for going higher I
 
01:30:58.189 --> 01:30:58.199 align:start position:0%
have chosen um to cut back a little bit
 
01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:02.840 align:start position:0%
by uh by sort of reducing by $25 million
 
01:31:05.910 --> 01:31:05.920 align:start position:0%
it's totally arbitrary I recognize that
 
01:31:08.430 --> 01:31:08.440 align:start position:0%
but uh from the numbers I otherwise get
 
01:31:09.910 --> 01:31:09.920 align:start position:0%
by the
 
01:31:12.350 --> 01:31:12.360 align:start position:0%
mathematical comparison with the
 
01:31:15.189 --> 01:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
previous years is sort of some some
 
01:31:17.189 --> 01:31:17.199 align:start position:0%
discomfort with those previous years
 
01:31:19.950 --> 01:31:19.960 align:start position:0%
that I think leads me to do that no
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:26.520 --> 01:31:30.590 align:start position:0%
 
year

01:31:30.590 --> 01:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:33.070 --> 01:31:33.080 align:start position:0%
um represent Al followed by
 
01:31:33.080 --> 01:31:35.590 align:start position:0%
um represent Al followed by
representative

01:31:35.590 --> 01:31:35.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:31:39.590 --> 01:31:39.600 align:start position:0%
BR thank you Mr chairman um I think this
 
01:31:44.149 --> 01:31:44.159 align:start position:0%
is back to Melissa again um
 
01:31:46.149 --> 01:31:46.159 align:start position:0%
representative abrami seems to think
 
01:31:49.750 --> 01:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
that on what we're talking about is that
 
01:31:54.149 --> 01:31:54.159 align:start position:0%
the 17 point five million would have
 
01:32:01.350 --> 01:32:01.360 align:start position:0%
been in March's on results last year if
 
01:32:05.870 --> 01:32:05.880 align:start position:0%
um if the we we hadn't had the delay in
 
01:32:08.750 --> 01:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
people paying what would the March
 
01:32:13.750 --> 01:32:13.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
year that is a great question and I do
 
01:32:22.669 --> 01:32:22.679 align:start position:0%
not have that in front of me um
 
01:32:29.870 --> 01:32:29.880 align:start position:0%
if I look at one second so we were 17 A5
 
01:32:33.310 --> 01:32:33.320 align:start position:0%
million B behind March of last
 
01:32:38.709 --> 01:32:38.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:38.719 --> 01:32:40.669 align:start position:0%
 
were

01:32:40.669 --> 01:32:40.679 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:32:48.430 --> 01:32:48.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:51.270 --> 01:32:51.280 align:start position:0%
year and let me just look at June real
 
01:32:53.030 --> 01:32:53.040 align:start position:0%
quick because that's when payments were
 
01:32:57.350 --> 01:32:57.360 align:start position:0%
due and we were short 35.2 million in
 
01:33:01.870 --> 01:33:01.880 align:start position:0%
June so I don't think the
 
01:33:05.070 --> 01:33:05.080 align:start position:0%
18.3 my my guess off the top of my head
 
01:33:07.990 --> 01:33:08.000 align:start position:0%
is not much of that 18.3 would have
 
01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:09.510 align:start position:0%
is not much of that 18.3 would have
supplemented

01:33:09.510 --> 01:33:09.520 align:start position:0%
supplemented
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
March uh it probably would have more
 
01:33:17.830 --> 01:33:17.840 align:start position:0%
supplemented April in June um so I would
 
01:33:19.669 --> 01:33:19.679 align:start position:0%
say March probably would have been a
 
01:33:22.350 --> 01:33:22.360 align:start position:0%
difference of a couple million so maybe
 
01:33:24.950 --> 01:33:24.960 align:start position:0%
15 million down just just a quick
 
01:33:28.990 --> 01:33:29.000 align:start position:0%
assumption based on the loss to
 
01:33:33.149 --> 01:33:33.159 align:start position:0%
April if that makes sense to you thank
 
01:33:36.830 --> 01:33:36.840 align:start position:0%
you and at that point did you think that
 
01:33:41.709 --> 01:33:41.719 align:start position:0%
uh the pandemic was affecting the the
 
01:33:44.229 --> 01:33:44.239 align:start position:0%
payments I think in March and April our
 
01:33:47.750 --> 01:33:47.760 align:start position:0%
assumptions were that the payments were
 
01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:50.320 align:start position:0%
just being delayed until
 
01:33:53.270 --> 01:33:53.280 align:start position:0%
June uh I think we anticipated we were
 
01:33:55.830 --> 01:33:55.840 align:start position:0%
going to see more payments in June and
 
01:33:58.790 --> 01:33:58.800 align:start position:0%
then the July situation happened so we
 
01:34:01.629 --> 01:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
saw some of those but but after
 
01:34:03.669 --> 01:34:03.679 align:start position:0%
realizing it the pandemic definitely
 
01:34:06.109 --> 01:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
affected affected payments because
 
01:34:08.950 --> 01:34:08.960 align:start position:0%
otherwise we would have seen that 18.3
 
01:34:11.510 --> 01:34:11.520 align:start position:0%
million be much larger or the payments
 
01:34:13.629 --> 01:34:13.639 align:start position:0%
in June should have exceeded planned by
 
01:34:16.590 --> 01:34:16.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:21.239 align:start position:0%
amount if I could just briefly follow up
 
01:34:21.239 --> 01:34:24.070 align:start position:0%
amount if I could just briefly follow up
uh

01:34:24.070 --> 01:34:24.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:26.430 --> 01:34:26.440 align:start position:0%
do we have I can't remember do we have
 
01:34:28.189 --> 01:34:28.199 align:start position:0%
data on what happened to the credit
 
01:34:32.070 --> 01:34:32.080 align:start position:0%
carry forward did was more of it used at
 
01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:36.030 align:start position:0%
carry forward did was more of it used at
that

01:34:36.030 --> 01:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:39.030 --> 01:34:39.040 align:start position:0%
point um I don't have specific data for
 
01:34:42.430 --> 01:34:42.440 align:start position:0%
that but it did grow from um 19 to
 
01:34:43.709 --> 01:34:43.719 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:34:47.149 --> 01:34:47.159 align:start position:0%
20 uh so it did increase and that does
 
01:34:48.870 --> 01:34:48.880 align:start position:0%
go through June
 
01:34:51.510 --> 01:34:51.520 align:start position:0%
30th but as for the specific months if
 
01:34:53.229 --> 01:34:53.239 align:start position:0%
in March April and June they used more
 
01:35:01.430 --> 01:35:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:03.709 --> 01:35:03.719 align:start position:0%
data yeah I think we got to move this
 
01:35:07.590 --> 01:35:07.600 align:start position:0%
forward um I I I respect
 
01:35:10.709 --> 01:35:10.719 align:start position:0%
uh representative ames's
 
01:35:13.030 --> 01:35:13.040 align:start position:0%
analysis uh I would need more time with
 
01:35:15.310 --> 01:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
it to feel more comfortable with it but
 
01:35:18.390 --> 01:35:18.400 align:start position:0%
that's the Democrat number uh what we've
 
01:35:20.189 --> 01:35:20.199 align:start position:0%
done in the past is we looked at
 
01:35:22.390 --> 01:35:22.400 align:start position:0%
Republican numbers 82
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
7.9 which is 17.1
 
01:35:30.430 --> 01:35:30.440 align:start position:0%
below uh the Democrat number I have no
 
01:35:31.750 --> 01:35:31.760 align:start position:0%
problem just splitting the difference
 
01:35:34.550 --> 01:35:34.560 align:start position:0%
like we have in the past uh that'll
 
01:35:36.990 --> 01:35:37.000 align:start position:0%
bring our number up and and and Dick's
 
01:35:40.229 --> 01:35:40.239 align:start position:0%
number down uh to to move this forward
 
01:35:41.990 --> 01:35:42.000 align:start position:0%
because we can debate back and forth
 
01:35:44.950 --> 01:35:44.960 align:start position:0%
about this uh I would suggest that
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
that's what we
 
01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:49.320 align:start position:0%
do I didn't get the uh your
 
01:35:52.229 --> 01:35:52.239 align:start position:0%
number our number is
 
01:35:56.590 --> 01:35:56.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.750 --> 01:36:00.760 align:start position:0%
27.9 which is 17.1 below your
 
01:36:03.510 --> 01:36:03.520 align:start position:0%
number so if we split the
 
01:36:07.070 --> 01:36:07.080 align:start position:0%
difference the average the the new
 
01:36:10.669 --> 01:36:10.679 align:start position:0%
number would be uh 8
 
01:36:15.709 --> 01:36:15.719 align:start position:0%
83745 right 83 836 837 as compared to
 
01:36:18.030 --> 01:36:18.040 align:start position:0%
last uh February's number of
 
01:36:23.030 --> 01:36:23.040 align:start position:0%
89.8 is what was in the uh resolution so
 
01:36:26.149 --> 01:36:26.159 align:start position:0%
it would be an increase of uh 26.6
 
01:36:28.629 --> 01:36:28.639 align:start position:0%
million from the original resolution
 
01:36:31.030 --> 01:36:31.040 align:start position:0%
from uh
 
01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:36.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:40.270 --> 01:36:40.280 align:start position:0%
thats I don't think I do I think that uh
 
01:36:43.070 --> 01:36:43.080 align:start position:0%
you know in in this business we we end
 
01:36:46.109 --> 01:36:46.119 align:start position:0%
up uh splitting the difference and this
 
01:36:48.750 --> 01:36:48.760 align:start position:0%
is another example of that and we are
 
01:36:52.990 --> 01:36:53.000 align:start position:0%
actually not that far apart
 
01:36:58.669 --> 01:36:58.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
in when they get the economist together
 
01:37:06.070 --> 01:37:06.080 align:start position:0%
we'll have a rain and they'll end up SP
 
01:37:08.510 --> 01:37:08.520 align:start position:0%
aaging at
 
01:37:14.070 --> 01:37:14.080 align:start position:0%
yeah no put set Economist that you put
 
01:37:16.790 --> 01:37:16.800 align:start position:0%
together something as diverse as the
 
01:37:19.990 --> 01:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
business taxes we all agree in one
 
01:37:22.669 --> 01:37:22.679 align:start position:0%
number and but they'll
 
01:37:27.390 --> 01:37:27.400 align:start position:0%
be and they end up averaging
 
01:37:32.310 --> 01:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
it um who else wants to chime in
 
01:37:32.320 --> 01:37:34.510 align:start position:0%
it um who else wants to chime in
on

01:37:34.510 --> 01:37:34.520 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:37:34.520 --> 01:37:38.390 align:start position:0%
on
fy21

01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.790 --> 01:37:41.800 align:start position:0%
numbers rep Brown you have your hand up
 
01:37:46.830 --> 01:37:46.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:50.950 --> 01:37:50.960 align:start position:0%
sorry and if we if we do that we would
 
01:37:55.390 --> 01:37:55.400 align:start position:0%
come out with uh the average of one of
 
01:37:58.149 --> 01:37:58.159 align:start position:0%
845 and
 
01:37:58.159 --> 01:37:59.830 align:start position:0%
845 and
8

01:37:59.830 --> 01:37:59.840 align:start position:0%
8
 
01:38:03.350 --> 01:38:03.360 align:start position:0%
27.9 is that correct yes yeah I think I
 
01:38:07.070 --> 01:38:07.080 align:start position:0%
think it comes out to 837 would be what
 
01:38:09.390 --> 01:38:09.400 align:start position:0%
I would say be
 
01:38:12.990 --> 01:38:13.000 align:start position:0%
837 if you that's rounding a little bit
 
01:38:17.030 --> 01:38:17.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:22.669 --> 01:38:22.679 align:start position:0%
8370 or or yeah okay hey
 
01:38:25.470 --> 01:38:25.480 align:start position:0%
37 and then we can use the
 
01:38:27.390 --> 01:38:27.400 align:start position:0%
percentages then we have to then we have
 
01:38:29.950 --> 01:38:29.960 align:start position:0%
to back out the 10 don't forget that yes
 
01:38:36.430 --> 01:38:36.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
827 and then agree on percentage
 
01:38:49.390 --> 01:38:49.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:52.109 --> 01:38:52.119 align:start position:0%
23 well the norm uh we went through a
 
01:38:53.750 --> 01:38:53.760 align:start position:0%
process both the Democrats and
 
01:38:55.669 --> 01:38:55.679 align:start position:0%
Republicans went through a process
 
01:38:58.589 --> 01:38:58.599 align:start position:0%
yesterday where we we've gone through
 
01:39:02.750 --> 01:39:02.760 align:start position:0%
that we we estimated our midpoint are
 
01:39:05.470 --> 01:39:05.480 align:start position:0%
high and a low than our midpoint uh that
 
01:39:07.870 --> 01:39:07.880 align:start position:0%
I'm sure the Democrats did something
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
similar uh so just if we're replicating
 
01:39:13.669 --> 01:39:13.679 align:start position:0%
what we did last in
 
01:39:15.709 --> 01:39:15.719 align:start position:0%
February uh I think those are the two
 
01:39:17.470 --> 01:39:17.480 align:start position:0%
numbers that are in play and then we
 
01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:19.480 align:start position:0%
have to decide if we want to uh
 
01:39:21.669 --> 01:39:21.679 align:start position:0%
compromise in the middle
 
01:39:25.229 --> 01:39:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:29.750 --> 01:39:29.760 align:start position:0%
compromise Mr chairman do that or or we
 
01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:32.880 align:start position:0%
could agree on percentages what
 
01:39:32.880 --> 01:39:34.109 align:start position:0%
could agree on percentages what
represent

01:39:34.109 --> 01:39:34.119 align:start position:0%
represent
 
01:39:36.629 --> 01:39:36.639 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you I I just wanted to
 
01:39:39.709 --> 01:39:39.719 align:start position:0%
advocate for agreeing on the percentages
 
01:39:43.070 --> 01:39:43.080 align:start position:0%
because we get further and further apart
 
01:39:49.189 --> 01:39:49.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:52.830 --> 01:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
percentages and I want if I could to ask
 
01:39:57.030 --> 01:39:57.040 align:start position:0%
uh Melissa yesterday um I think it was
 
01:39:59.629 --> 01:39:59.639 align:start position:0%
you told us that you're going to have to
 
01:40:02.109 --> 01:40:02.119 align:start position:0%
think about the growth rates for this
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
next year which starts in a few months
 
01:40:09.310 --> 01:40:09.320 align:start position:0%
on in terms of what's been going on in
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
the economy which is what's been going
 
01:40:15.310 --> 01:40:15.320 align:start position:0%
on in the economy is what's been
 
01:40:17.709 --> 01:40:17.719 align:start position:0%
changing our minds about what we just
 
01:40:22.669 --> 01:40:22.679 align:start position:0%
did so you had it at 1 to three%
 
01:40:27.189 --> 01:40:27.199 align:start position:0%
and I was wondering if for 23 changing
 
01:40:30.830 --> 01:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
nothing in 20 for 22 changing nothing in
 
01:40:35.790 --> 01:40:35.800 align:start position:0%
23 if um two to 4% was within your realm
 
01:40:35.800 --> 01:40:36.750 align:start position:0%
23 if um two to 4% was within your realm
of

01:40:36.750 --> 01:40:36.760 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:40:38.750 --> 01:40:38.760 align:start position:0%
consideration knowing that you don't
 
01:40:41.189 --> 01:40:41.199 align:start position:0%
have all the data for March yet much
 
01:40:41.199 --> 01:40:42.470 align:start position:0%
have all the data for March yet much
less

01:40:42.470 --> 01:40:42.480 align:start position:0%
less
 
01:40:44.709 --> 01:40:44.719 align:start position:0%
April yeah thank you for your your
 
01:40:46.910 --> 01:40:46.920 align:start position:0%
question representative Aly um we have
 
01:40:48.910 --> 01:40:48.920 align:start position:0%
not dug into this you are correct
 
01:40:52.830 --> 01:40:52.840 align:start position:0%
however uh I did I think I heard heard
 
01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:54.760 align:start position:0%
representative major speak earlier I'm
 
01:40:57.229 --> 01:40:57.239 align:start position:0%
looking down at my notes that they did
 
01:40:57.239 --> 01:40:58.589 align:start position:0%
looking down at my notes that they did
increase

01:40:58.589 --> 01:40:58.599 align:start position:0%
increase
 
01:41:04.310 --> 01:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
GDP um for 2021 to 6% is that correct
 
01:41:04.320 --> 01:41:05.750 align:start position:0%
GDP um for 2021 to 6% is that correct
representative

01:41:05.750 --> 01:41:05.760 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:09.669 align:start position:0%
representative
major

01:41:09.669 --> 01:41:09.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:15.750 --> 01:41:15.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and if if that six and a half% for
 
01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:19.310 align:start position:0%
yeah and if if that six and a half% for
21.3%

01:41:19.310 --> 01:41:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:22.109 --> 01:41:22.119 align:start position:0%
22 so that being said when we were
 
01:41:24.790 --> 01:41:24.800 align:start position:0%
looking at our growth rates before we
 
01:41:27.870 --> 01:41:27.880 align:start position:0%
were relying on GDP and slowing it down
 
01:41:30.510 --> 01:41:30.520 align:start position:0%
in 2022 a little bit based on when
 
01:41:32.830 --> 01:41:32.840 align:start position:0%
timing comes in for returns and how
 
01:41:36.550 --> 01:41:36.560 align:start position:0%
taxpayers will reflect their funds and
 
01:41:37.470 --> 01:41:37.480 align:start position:0%
then in
 
01:41:41.910 --> 01:41:41.920 align:start position:0%
2023 so I I think um without further
 
01:41:44.229 --> 01:41:44.239 align:start position:0%
analysis but based on that information
 
01:41:47.629 --> 01:41:47.639 align:start position:0%
if we do think GDP is growing and I want
 
01:41:50.310 --> 01:41:50.320 align:start position:0%
to look at some other sources too then I
 
01:41:52.270 --> 01:41:52.280 align:start position:0%
think we would be
 
01:41:54.950 --> 01:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
comfortable maybe expanding that range a
 
01:41:59.109 --> 01:41:59.119 align:start position:0%
little bit to to two to 4% I think the
 
01:42:01.510 --> 01:42:01.520 align:start position:0%
only hesitation I have a little bit and
 
01:42:03.430 --> 01:42:03.440 align:start position:0%
I would want to dig into it is just
 
01:42:06.629 --> 01:42:06.639 align:start position:0%
where 21 does land um representative
 
01:42:08.589 --> 01:42:08.599 align:start position:0%
Ames definitely had some good points and
 
01:42:11.589 --> 01:42:11.599 align:start position:0%
March is looking good right now um my
 
01:42:16.109 --> 01:42:16.119 align:start position:0%
only caution for March is we do have um
 
01:42:18.629 --> 01:42:18.639 align:start position:0%
some refunds still coming out that
 
01:42:20.310 --> 01:42:20.320 align:start position:0%
haven't been reflected so that number
 
01:42:21.790 --> 01:42:21.800 align:start position:0%
does go down
 
01:42:25.350 --> 01:42:25.360 align:start position:0%
some but if 21 comes in higher than
 
01:42:27.750 --> 01:42:27.760 align:start position:0%
expected and meaning we're recovering
 
01:42:31.350 --> 01:42:31.360 align:start position:0%
quicker than expected do we still think
 
01:42:36.470 --> 01:42:36.480 align:start position:0%
22 will continue that growth of two I
 
01:42:39.430 --> 01:42:39.440 align:start position:0%
think you said 2 to 4% or are we feeling
 
01:42:41.790 --> 01:42:41.800 align:start position:0%
some of that growth already right now so
 
01:42:43.310 --> 01:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
just some things that are running
 
01:42:44.790 --> 01:42:44.800 align:start position:0%
through my mind quickly as we're
 
01:42:48.270 --> 01:42:48.280 align:start position:0%
thinking about thinking about this but
 
01:42:50.430 --> 01:42:50.440 align:start position:0%
where we're at 1 to 4% and you saying
 
01:42:54.030 --> 01:42:54.040 align:start position:0%
two to to 4% with GDP going up I don't
 
01:43:05.830 --> 01:43:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:08.790 --> 01:43:08.800 align:start position:0%
possibilities and and the Democrats had
 
01:43:12.750 --> 01:43:12.760 align:start position:0%
um raised it from 1 to 3% to two to 4%
 
01:43:15.510 --> 01:43:15.520 align:start position:0%
and taken the median when we were doing
 
01:43:21.229 --> 01:43:21.239 align:start position:0%
ours um that is um 3% growth for the
 
01:43:25.229 --> 01:43:25.239 align:start position:0%
taxes not not the not the economy the
 
01:43:28.950 --> 01:43:28.960 align:start position:0%
economy is going on now and last year
 
01:43:34.790 --> 01:43:34.800 align:start position:0%
but um the the tax is on going up three
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
3% in 22 and then holding on to the four
 
01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.030 align:start position:0%
3% in 22 and then holding on to the four
to

01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:43:43.470 --> 01:43:43.480 align:start position:0%
six% uh
 
01:43:46.390 --> 01:43:46.400 align:start position:0%
in in
 
01:43:48.830 --> 01:43:48.840 align:start position:0%
23 and when we did
 
01:43:52.870 --> 01:43:52.880 align:start position:0%
it we went up to 2.1%
 
01:43:56.350 --> 01:43:56.360 align:start position:0%
from 21 to
 
01:43:59.629 --> 01:43:59.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:01.990 --> 01:44:02.000 align:start position:0%
is just about right in the middle
 
01:44:04.550 --> 01:44:04.560 align:start position:0%
between one and
 
01:44:06.870 --> 01:44:06.880 align:start position:0%
three no did you take the 10 million out
 
01:44:12.990 --> 01:44:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:15.350 --> 01:44:15.360 align:start position:0%
okay we went up
 
01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:16.910 align:start position:0%
okay we went up
3%

01:44:16.910 --> 01:44:16.920 align:start position:0%
3%
 
01:44:27.669 --> 01:44:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:35.830 --> 01:44:35.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.550 --> 01:44:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:52.870 align:start position:0%
 
16

01:44:52.870 --> 01:44:52.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:02.189 --> 01:45:02.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:06.510 --> 01:45:06.520 align:start position:0%
something um somebody else want to weigh
 
01:45:12.430 --> 01:45:12.440 align:start position:0%
in on what they fig well n number
 
01:45:15.550 --> 01:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
one do we all agree of a starting point
 
01:45:15.560 --> 01:45:17.070 align:start position:0%
one do we all agree of a starting point
of

01:45:17.070 --> 01:45:17.080 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:45:22.830 --> 01:45:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:24.990 --> 01:45:25.000 align:start position:0%
if you don't agree I want to say a
 
01:45:25.000 --> 01:45:27.629 align:start position:0%
if you don't agree I want to say a
raised

01:45:27.629 --> 01:45:27.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:31.430 --> 01:45:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:35.229 --> 01:45:35.239 align:start position:0%
hands representative SPS spillsbury
 
01:45:37.910 --> 01:45:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr
 
01:45:41.149 --> 01:45:41.159 align:start position:0%
chairman I don't have a crystal ball so
 
01:45:43.390 --> 01:45:43.400 align:start position:0%
I I won't say anything
 
01:45:47.070 --> 01:45:47.080 align:start position:0%
assertively but I admire Melissa
 
01:45:48.629 --> 01:45:48.639 align:start position:0%
rollin's careful way of explaining
 
01:45:51.510 --> 01:45:51.520 align:start position:0%
things to us and I think
 
01:45:54.790 --> 01:45:54.800 align:start position:0%
her her observation about representative
 
01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:56.750 align:start position:0%
her her observation about representative
Ames

01:45:56.750 --> 01:45:56.760 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
845 which happens to be higher than dr's
 
01:46:03.350 --> 01:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
high was that it's not outside the realm
 
01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:05.109 align:start position:0%
high was that it's not outside the realm
of

01:46:05.109 --> 01:46:05.119 align:start position:0%
of
 
01:46:07.709 --> 01:46:07.719 align:start position:0%
possibilities so let's grant
 
01:46:10.669 --> 01:46:10.679 align:start position:0%
that but is something which is not
 
01:46:12.350 --> 01:46:12.360 align:start position:0%
outside the realm of
 
01:46:18.189 --> 01:46:18.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:21.629 --> 01:46:21.639 align:start position:0%
forecasting seems high
 
01:46:25.550 --> 01:46:25.560 align:start position:0%
and so that's why take the average of of
 
01:46:27.910 --> 01:46:27.920 align:start position:0%
both and
 
01:46:31.109 --> 01:46:31.119 align:start position:0%
the is not as not as
 
01:46:38.790 --> 01:46:38.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:41.070 --> 01:46:41.080 align:start position:0%
been so would
 
01:46:43.270 --> 01:46:43.280 align:start position:0%
you come up with something different
 
01:46:47.229 --> 01:46:47.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:51.629 --> 01:46:51.639 align:start position:0%
837 well I guess what I'm suggesting to
 
01:46:55.070 --> 01:46:55.080 align:start position:0%
our Democrat friends is if 845 is
 
01:46:56.709 --> 01:46:56.719 align:start position:0%
effectively their midpoint and their
 
01:47:00.510 --> 01:47:00.520 align:start position:0%
midpoint is north of the dr's high do
 
01:47:03.030 --> 01:47:03.040 align:start position:0%
they want to reconsider that figure
 
01:47:05.270 --> 01:47:05.280 align:start position:0%
before we go ahead and average the two
 
01:47:08.709 --> 01:47:08.719 align:start position:0%
I'm perfectly fine with avering two
 
01:47:12.430 --> 01:47:12.440 align:start position:0%
okay Dave um I mean
 
01:47:14.870 --> 01:47:14.880 align:start position:0%
de represent ases do you have any
 
01:47:16.550 --> 01:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
comments on
 
01:47:19.990 --> 01:47:20.000 align:start position:0%
that well I guess I at first say I
 
01:47:22.310 --> 01:47:22.320 align:start position:0%
thought we' gone through this discussion
 
01:47:25.790 --> 01:47:25.800 align:start position:0%
um uh and just I I believe that the
 
01:47:29.589 --> 01:47:29.599 align:start position:0%
Democrats considered the Dr high as well
 
01:47:33.669 --> 01:47:33.679 align:start position:0%
as it's low when we discussed this um in
 
01:47:36.709 --> 01:47:36.719 align:start position:0%
caucus and uh have continued to think
 
01:47:40.950 --> 01:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
about it ever since then as I have um
 
01:47:47.229 --> 01:47:47.239 align:start position:0%
and uh I when I uh was uh discussing
 
01:47:50.910 --> 01:47:50.920 align:start position:0%
this yesterday I didn't uh
 
01:47:53.990 --> 01:47:54.000 align:start position:0%
realized that my my train of logic took
 
01:47:58.510 --> 01:47:58.520 align:start position:0%
me even higher than U where I had I was
 
01:48:01.830 --> 01:48:01.840 align:start position:0%
coming down um so as I say I've locked
 
01:48:04.510 --> 01:48:04.520 align:start position:0%
off $25 million from where this takes us
 
01:48:07.750 --> 01:48:07.760 align:start position:0%
to I'd also note with regard to the Dr
 
01:48:10.629 --> 01:48:10.639 align:start position:0%
High number they've made quite clear
 
01:48:12.830 --> 01:48:12.840 align:start position:0%
that they have not Revisited their
 
01:48:16.510 --> 01:48:16.520 align:start position:0%
estimates other than um to take into
 
01:48:19.430 --> 01:48:19.440 align:start position:0%
account the February number uh so they
 
01:48:21.830 --> 01:48:21.840 align:start position:0%
haven't gone through through uh
 
01:48:25.430 --> 01:48:25.440 align:start position:0%
internally a process that revisits um
 
01:48:27.510 --> 01:48:27.520 align:start position:0%
and Melissa can correct me if I'm wrong
 
01:48:30.270 --> 01:48:30.280 align:start position:0%
about this but uh going through the kind
 
01:48:31.790 --> 01:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
of discussion we're going through right
 
01:48:36.830 --> 01:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
now uh that looks at um performance
 
01:48:38.870 --> 01:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
since the receipt of that February
 
01:48:41.430 --> 01:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
number and how that February number
 
01:48:43.870 --> 01:48:43.880 align:start position:0%
should affect uh
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:51.910 --> 01:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
number represent
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chairman um I would just
 
01:48:57.990 --> 01:48:58.000 align:start position:0%
say um I am very comfortable with the
 
01:49:01.709 --> 01:49:01.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:05.149 --> 01:49:05.159 align:start position:0%
compromise fine and should we
 
01:49:10.109 --> 01:49:10.119 align:start position:0%
uh take a vote on this or some got any
 
01:49:10.119 --> 01:49:11.910 align:start position:0%
uh take a vote on this or some got any
other

01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
other
 
01:49:15.550 --> 01:49:15.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:19.109 --> 01:49:19.119 align:start position:0%
not why don't we take a vote on the
 
01:49:23.070 --> 01:49:23.080 align:start position:0%
837 that would set the tone for going to
 
01:49:25.310 --> 01:49:25.320 align:start position:0%
22 and 23
 
01:49:33.950 --> 01:49:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:37.390 --> 01:49:37.400 align:start position:0%
taxes so
 
01:49:41.390 --> 01:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
um I'll make I'll make the motion that
 
01:49:47.830 --> 01:49:47.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:52.189 --> 01:49:52.199 align:start position:0%
fy21 will come in at 8 $ 37
 
01:49:57.149 --> 01:49:57.159 align:start position:0%
million as a compromise and I'd second
 
01:50:00.189 --> 01:50:00.199 align:start position:0%
that any other Mr chairman can we go
 
01:50:05.350 --> 01:50:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.360 --> 01:50:10.310 align:start position:0%
 
voting

01:50:10.310 --> 01:50:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:10.320 --> 01:50:12.070 align:start position:0%
 
Chris

01:50:12.070 --> 01:50:12.080 align:start position:0%
Chris
 
01:50:17.950 --> 01:50:17.960 align:start position:0%
poll so the motion has been made 837 for
 
01:50:21.189 --> 01:50:21.199 align:start position:0%

820 no no that was something else yeah
 
01:54:00.870 --> 01:54:00.880 align:start position:0%
827 times 2.5% someone else wants to do
 
01:54:06.470 --> 01:54:06.480 align:start position:0%
it well 837 times 1. no 8
 
01:54:09.629 --> 01:54:09.639 align:start position:0%
827 we have to take out 27 right right
 
01:54:13.390 --> 01:54:13.400 align:start position:0%
sorry mistake
 
01:54:18.669 --> 01:54:18.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:18.679 --> 01:54:48.669 align:start position:0%
 
1.025

01:54:48.669 --> 01:54:48.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:51.669 --> 01:54:51.679 align:start position:0%
847.0135 interestingly
 
01:54:54.709 --> 01:54:54.719 align:start position:0%
enough uh again to me we're changing the
 
01:54:56.430 --> 01:54:56.440 align:start position:0%
rule a little bit because I thought we
 
01:54:57.750 --> 01:54:57.760 align:start position:0%
were going to do it the way we did it
 
01:55:01.470 --> 01:55:01.480 align:start position:0%
last time so Republicans came up with
 
01:55:05.510 --> 01:55:05.520 align:start position:0%

01:55:24.550 --> 01:55:24.560 align:start position:0%

01:55:27.830 --> 01:55:27.840 align:start position:0%
Republican uh work yesterday and the
 
01:55:44.430 --> 01:55:44.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:49.109 --> 01:55:49.119 align:start position:0%
847.011 on the old number right um but
 
01:55:50.189 --> 01:55:50.199 align:start position:0%

01:55:52.790 --> 01:55:52.800 align:start position:0%

01:56:00.750 --> 01:56:00.760 align:start position:0%

yes 24 to nothing chairman
 
01:58:15.030 --> 01:58:15.040 align:start position:0%
major vote been 24 to nothing the
 
01:58:20.589 --> 01:58:20.599 align:start position:0%
estimate for fy22 is $847 7 million was
 
01:58:24.069 --> 01:58:24.079 align:start position:0%
going to um FY
 
01:58:28.109 --> 01:58:28.119 align:start position:0%
23 um point of order chairman if I may
 
01:58:30.790 --> 01:58:30.800 align:start position:0%
yes represent s the only thing I'm
 
01:58:33.790 --> 01:58:33.800 align:start position:0%
looking at on the chart is our estimates
 
01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:35.229 align:start position:0%
looking at on the chart is our estimates
were

01:58:35.229 --> 01:58:35.239 align:start position:0%
were
 
01:58:41.790 --> 01:58:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:45.470 --> 01:58:45.480 align:start position:0%
826 this time we're going from 837 to
 
01:58:48.149 --> 01:58:48.159 align:start position:0%
8:47 so I'm just wondering if something
 
01:58:51.629 --> 01:58:51.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:55.510 --> 01:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
well the 837 you have to re remove $10
 
01:58:57.950 --> 01:58:57.960 align:start position:0%
million and then a two and a half%
 
01:59:01.030 --> 01:59:01.040 align:start position:0%
increase it brings you up to 847 okay
 
01:59:04.189 --> 01:59:04.199 align:start position:0%
and did we somehow not do that when we
 
01:59:08.109 --> 01:59:08.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:10.390 --> 01:59:10.400 align:start position:0%
estimates because it just seems strange
 
01:59:14.310 --> 01:59:14.320 align:start position:0%
that it goes from 809 all the way up to
 
01:59:18.229 --> 01:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
826 and then it goes only from 837 to
 
01:59:21.990 --> 01:59:22.000 align:start position:0%
847 believe when we did the February
 
01:59:24.109 --> 01:59:24.119 align:start position:0%
estimates is that we didn't have that
 
01:59:26.589 --> 01:59:26.599 align:start position:0%
$10 million okay so that's that's
 
01:59:29.470 --> 01:59:29.480 align:start position:0%
another change thank
 
01:59:34.750 --> 01:59:34.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:39.830 --> 01:59:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:43.480 align:start position:0%
all the r uh increase
 
01:59:46.350 --> 01:59:46.360 align:start position:0%
of we need to settle on a percentage
 
01:59:54.830 --> 01:59:54.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:57.910 --> 01:59:57.920 align:start position:0%
I I need somebody to step to the
 
02:00:04.669 --> 02:00:04.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:04.679 --> 02:00:07.149 align:start position:0%
 
six%

02:00:07.149 --> 02:00:07.159 align:start position:0%
six%
 
02:00:09.430 --> 02:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
before represent major before I do that
 
02:00:13.229 --> 02:00:13.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:16.709 --> 02:00:16.719 align:start position:0%
ask so you know we we went through the
 
02:00:19.189 --> 02:00:19.199 align:start position:0%
exercise a week ago sound like a broken
 
02:00:23.669 --> 02:00:23.679 align:start position:0%
record here uh about the uh single sales
 
02:00:27.229 --> 02:00:27.239 align:start position:0%
Factor um I made sure in the Republican
 
02:00:31.350 --> 02:00:31.360 align:start position:0%
caucus um kind of like a broken record
 
02:00:36.430 --> 02:00:36.440 align:start position:0%
like I said and we we we assumed in our
 
02:00:41.950 --> 02:00:41.960 align:start position:0%
number uh that the uh single sales
 
02:00:45.550 --> 02:00:45.560 align:start position:0%
Factor uh was in
 
02:00:48.510 --> 02:00:48.520 align:start position:0%
place so that we took the our lower
 
02:00:48.520 --> 02:00:49.830 align:start position:0%
place so that we took the our lower
estimate

02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
estimate
 
02:00:52.030 --> 02:00:52.040 align:start position:0%
uh because the $20
 
02:00:55.510 --> 02:00:55.520 align:start position:0%
million uh issue
 
02:00:59.270 --> 02:00:59.280 align:start position:0%
because as of now Finance is going to
 
02:01:02.950 --> 02:01:02.960 align:start position:0%
put uh our bill into the
 
02:01:05.109 --> 02:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
hb2 put a hold
 
02:01:08.589 --> 02:01:08.599 align:start position:0%
on it's gonna add 20 million to
 
02:01:11.149 --> 02:01:11.159 align:start position:0%
revenues because of single sales Factor
 
02:01:14.229 --> 02:01:14.239 align:start position:0%
because of single sales Factor so I know
 
02:01:15.870 --> 02:01:15.880 align:start position:0%
the Democrat number is
 
02:01:15.880 --> 02:01:17.470 align:start position:0%
the Democrat number is
9003

02:01:17.470 --> 02:01:17.480 align:start position:0%
9003
 
02:01:22.629 --> 02:01:22.639 align:start position:0%
um uh I just want to know if if that 903
 
02:01:24.990 --> 02:01:25.000 align:start position:0%
included uh the elimination of the
 
02:01:26.990 --> 02:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
single sales factor or included the
 
02:01:28.990 --> 02:01:29.000 align:start position:0%
single sales
 
02:01:32.470 --> 02:01:32.480 align:start position:0%
Factor um representative gramy or
 
02:01:35.830 --> 02:01:35.840 align:start position:0%
representative uh Mr chair is it okay if
 
02:01:40.109 --> 02:01:40.119 align:start position:0%
I ask a question go ahead represent I I
 
02:01:42.149 --> 02:01:42.159 align:start position:0%
guess I didn't hear maybe it was said
 
02:01:44.709 --> 02:01:44.719 align:start position:0%
what what your Republican caucus number
 
02:01:51.990 --> 02:01:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.229 --> 02:01:55.239 align:start position:0%
59.8 lower than than the de you know
 
02:01:58.109 --> 02:01:58.119 align:start position:0%
than the Democrat number of
 
02:02:00.830 --> 02:02:00.840 align:start position:0%
n was there an assumed rate of growth
 
02:02:03.229 --> 02:02:03.239 align:start position:0%
and then a subtraction of some number
 
02:02:06.470 --> 02:02:06.480 align:start position:0%
for single sales or how did you do it no
 
02:02:09.830 --> 02:02:09.840 align:start position:0%
we we did it we just did high low each
 
02:02:12.350 --> 02:02:12.360 align:start position:0%
member each member gave us high
 
02:02:15.109 --> 02:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
low uh we took the average of the highs
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
the average of the lows and then took
 
02:02:17.199 --> 02:02:17.950 align:start position:0%
the average of the lows and then took
the

02:02:17.950 --> 02:02:17.960 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:19.790 align:start position:0%
the
midpoint

02:02:19.790 --> 02:02:19.800 align:start position:0%
midpoint
 
02:02:23.149 --> 02:02:23.159 align:start position:0%
and that assumed that it was current law
 
02:02:23.159 --> 02:02:24.030 align:start position:0%
and that assumed that it was current law
so

02:02:24.030 --> 02:02:24.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:02:26.470 --> 02:02:26.480 align:start position:0%
we took a more conservative number
 
02:02:29.390 --> 02:02:29.400 align:start position:0%
thinking that single sales Factor would
 
02:02:31.870 --> 02:02:31.880 align:start position:0%
be in place by
 
02:02:35.910 --> 02:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
23 um so if if that wasn't the case our
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
number would be $20 million
 
02:02:41.069 --> 02:02:41.079 align:start position:0%
more it'
 
02:02:41.079 --> 02:02:42.910 align:start position:0%
more it'
be88

02:02:42.910 --> 02:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
be88
 
02:02:46.310 --> 02:02:46.320 align:start position:0%
79.8 right because we have taken into
 
02:02:48.990 --> 02:02:49.000 align:start position:0%
consideration the single sales Factor
 
02:02:51.589 --> 02:02:51.599 align:start position:0%
which is getting going to be put back in
 
02:02:54.270 --> 02:02:54.280 align:start position:0%
in House Bill
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:59.990 --> 02:03:00.000 align:start position:0%
right Mr
 
02:03:05.149 --> 02:03:05.159 align:start position:0%
chairman yes our number was created by
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
adding a 5% growth rate okay so we are
 
02:03:16.189 --> 02:03:16.199 align:start position:0%
no longer at the same number in 22 so on
 
02:03:21.189 --> 02:03:21.199 align:start position:0%
our number from there would be lower um
 
02:03:21.199 --> 02:03:22.390 align:start position:0%
our number from there would be lower um
than

02:03:22.390 --> 02:03:22.400 align:start position:0%
than
 
02:03:25.629 --> 02:03:25.639 align:start position:0%
93 and I believe that we did forget the
 
02:03:28.709 --> 02:03:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:33.750 --> 02:03:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:36.589 --> 02:03:36.599 align:start position:0%
because and as far as the finance
 
02:03:39.430 --> 02:03:39.440 align:start position:0%
committee goes House Bill
 
02:03:43.149 --> 02:03:43.159 align:start position:0%
two with the delay of using House Bill
 
02:03:45.830 --> 02:03:45.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:49.390 --> 02:03:49.400 align:start position:0%
281 is a $20 million advantage and it
 
02:03:52.229 --> 02:03:52.239 align:start position:0%
puts it back in
 
02:03:56.310 --> 02:03:56.320 align:start position:0%
so we lose it in our numbers because
 
02:03:58.549 --> 02:03:58.559 align:start position:0%
it's law current
 
02:04:01.830 --> 02:04:01.840 align:start position:0%
law and in house build two because we
 
02:04:03.109 --> 02:04:03.119 align:start position:0%
we're going to
 
02:04:06.149 --> 02:04:06.159 align:start position:0%
defer a few more years the single sales
 
02:04:08.910 --> 02:04:08.920 align:start position:0%
Factor you can put it back
 
02:04:11.430 --> 02:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
in our number should
 
02:04:14.350 --> 02:04:14.360 align:start position:0%
reflect the single sales Factor $20
 
02:04:20.470 --> 02:04:20.480 align:start position:0%
million yes and I think um if if if we
 
02:04:36.800 --> 02:04:36.810 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:36.810 --> 02:04:50.069 align:start position:0%
 
[Music]

02:04:50.069 --> 02:04:50.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.079 --> 02:04:54.109 align:start position:0%
 
that's

02:04:54.109 --> 02:04:54.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:54.119 --> 02:04:56.589 align:start position:0%
 
better

02:04:56.589 --> 02:04:56.599 align:start position:0%
better
 
02:05:18.750 --> 02:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:20.950 --> 02:05:20.960 align:start position:0%
doing a calculation here so so
 
02:05:23.830 --> 02:05:23.840 align:start position:0%
Republicans were at 8 59.8 Democrats
 
02:05:26.790 --> 02:05:26.800 align:start position:0%
were at 870 if we took the midpoint if
 
02:05:28.910 --> 02:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
we want to do it that way
 
02:05:33.149 --> 02:05:33.159 align:start position:0%
again on representative agami our
 
02:05:34.750 --> 02:05:34.760 align:start position:0%
position was the
 
02:05:39.470 --> 02:05:39.480 align:start position:0%
5% on top of of
 
02:05:42.750 --> 02:05:42.760 align:start position:0%
22 and 22 has changed
 
02:05:44.790 --> 02:05:44.800 align:start position:0%
so they aren't
 
02:05:48.270 --> 02:05:48.280 align:start position:0%
comparable the the business taxes are
 
02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:50.310 align:start position:0%
comparable the the business taxes are
different

02:05:50.310 --> 02:05:50.320 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:05:50.320 --> 02:05:52.470 align:start position:0%
different
because

02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
because
 
02:05:56.149 --> 02:05:56.159 align:start position:0%
we we remot $20
 
02:05:59.669 --> 02:05:59.679 align:start position:0%
million because of the single sales
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
factor is current
 
02:06:05.950 --> 02:06:05.960 align:start position:0%
law but in HB 2 we we're going to put
 
02:06:09.750 --> 02:06:09.760 align:start position:0%
$20 million back because we're going to
 
02:06:13.149 --> 02:06:13.159 align:start position:0%
delay the S Sales Factor so two numbers
 
02:06:16.270 --> 02:06:16.280 align:start position:0%
should be the same in both
 
02:06:19.790 --> 02:06:19.800 align:start position:0%
sides so I have no problem taking the 88
 
02:06:24.350 --> 02:06:24.360 align:start position:0%
47.7 multiplying by 5% and reducing it
 
02:06:27.669 --> 02:06:27.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:29.549 --> 02:06:29.559 align:start position:0%
million you saying you're okay with the
 
02:06:33.870 --> 02:06:33.880 align:start position:0%
870 Norm yeah
 
02:06:38.069 --> 02:06:38.079 align:start position:0%
yes to offer yes has his hand
 
02:06:40.470 --> 02:06:40.480 align:start position:0%
up thank you represent major I just
 
02:06:43.430 --> 02:06:43.440 align:start position:0%
wanted to um remind the committee that
 
02:06:45.750 --> 02:06:45.760 align:start position:0%
with your estimates that you do today
 
02:06:48.750 --> 02:06:48.760 align:start position:0%
under under current law we would include
 
02:06:50.390 --> 02:06:50.400 align:start position:0%
those in and House Bill one under the
 
02:06:50.400 --> 02:06:51.669 align:start position:0%
those in and House Bill one under the
unrestricted

02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
unrestricted
 
02:06:53.830 --> 02:06:53.840 align:start position:0%
revenues so these would be under current
 
02:06:56.990 --> 02:06:57.000 align:start position:0%
law pure anything related to House Bill
 
02:06:59.229 --> 02:06:59.239 align:start position:0%
two so if there's a change related to
 
02:07:01.430 --> 02:07:01.440 align:start position:0%
revenues as a result of a house bill two
 
02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:03.559 align:start position:0%
section that would be accounted for in
 
02:07:05.549 --> 02:07:05.559 align:start position:0%
the Surplus statement it would show up
 
02:07:07.030 --> 02:07:07.040 align:start position:0%
on the Surplus statement it wouldn't
 
02:07:08.589 --> 02:07:08.599 align:start position:0%
show up in your Revenue estimates that
 
02:07:10.069 --> 02:07:10.079 align:start position:0%
you come up with
 
02:07:12.549 --> 02:07:12.559 align:start position:0%
today so I I just want to make sure that
 
02:07:14.549 --> 02:07:14.559 align:start position:0%
you guys as you're figuring out like
 
02:07:17.149 --> 02:07:17.159 align:start position:0%
you're bringing up the um single sales
 
02:07:19.790 --> 02:07:19.800 align:start position:0%
factor that 20 million will be shown on
 
02:07:21.669 --> 02:07:21.679 align:start position:0%
a surplus statement it won't be shown in
 
02:07:23.069 --> 02:07:23.079 align:start position:0%
the unrestricted revenues that are
 
02:07:27.069 --> 02:07:27.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:29.430 --> 02:07:29.440 align:start position:0%
because yeah I think we've got that
 
02:07:31.669 --> 02:07:31.679 align:start position:0%
that's clear and that's good to have it
 
02:07:35.790 --> 02:07:35.800 align:start position:0%
yes said so clearly um so I think what
 
02:07:40.270 --> 02:07:40.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:43.199 align:start position:0%
87.1 um as a possible compromise number
 
02:07:45.870 --> 02:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
is that do I have it right
 
02:07:45.880 --> 02:07:47.510 align:start position:0%
is that do I have it right
87.1

02:07:47.510 --> 02:07:47.520 align:start position:0%
87.1
 
02:07:47.520 --> 02:07:51.270 align:start position:0%
87.1
87.1

02:07:51.270 --> 02:07:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:53.629 --> 02:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
I I can I can I can do without the 0.1
 
02:07:55.709 --> 02:07:55.719 align:start position:0%
if it makes it
 
02:07:55.719 --> 02:07:57.790 align:start position:0%
if it makes it
easier

02:07:57.790 --> 02:07:57.800 align:start position:0%
easier
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
870 yes I can I can live with that I
 
02:08:03.510 --> 02:08:03.520 align:start position:0%
don't know about everybody else okay
 
02:08:06.149 --> 02:08:06.159 align:start position:0%
anybody else have any other way they
 
02:08:08.350 --> 02:08:08.360 align:start position:0%
want to figure this
 
02:08:14.950 --> 02:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
out see none than us for a motion for
 
02:08:17.430 --> 02:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
the $870
 
02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:21.149 align:start position:0%
the $870
million

02:08:21.149 --> 02:08:21.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:24.350 --> 02:08:24.360 align:start position:0%
if there's silence I'll I'll jump in I
 
02:08:28.109 --> 02:08:28.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:28.119 --> 02:08:29.750 align:start position:0%
 
87.0

02:08:29.750 --> 02:08:29.760 align:start position:0%
87.0
 
02:08:35.549 --> 02:08:35.559 align:start position:0%
million as the estimate for FY 23
 
02:08:40.549 --> 02:08:40.559 align:start position:0%
FY FY 23 right and seconded by who Pat
 
02:08:44.589 --> 02:08:44.599 align:start position:0%
ABY okay so the motion on the floor is
 
02:08:49.109 --> 02:08:49.119 align:start position:0%
FY 23 business revenue of 87
 
02:08:51.910 --> 02:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
million made by
 
02:08:54.229 --> 02:08:54.239 align:start position:0%
representative am seconded by
 
02:08:55.549 --> 02:08:55.559 align:start position:0%
representative AB
 
02:08:58.229 --> 02:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
bronley there any further discussions or
 
02:09:02.709 --> 02:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
questions on this if not I seeing none
 
02:09:04.870 --> 02:09:04.880 align:start position:0%
so representative Bernstein would you
 
02:09:08.629 --> 02:09:08.639 align:start position:0%
call the vote on this sure thank you Mr
 
02:09:11.669 --> 02:09:11.679 align:start position:0%
chair if everyone's clear on the motion
 
02:09:12.990 --> 02:09:13.000 align:start position:0%
we'll begin the roll call with
 
02:09:16.350 --> 02:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
representative abrami yes
 
02:09:18.990 --> 02:09:19.000 align:start position:0%
Aaron yes

02:17:39.709 --> 02:17:39.719 align:start position:0%
back I think we can change the procedure
 
02:17:42.309 --> 02:17:42.319 align:start position:0%
a little bit now
 
02:17:45.070 --> 02:17:45.080 align:start position:0%
so because we got the tough tough one
 
02:17:46.589 --> 02:17:46.599 align:start position:0%
out of the
 
02:17:46.599 --> 02:17:51.549 align:start position:0%
out of the
way

02:17:51.549 --> 02:17:51.559 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:53.150 --> 02:17:53.160 align:start position:0%
I'm waiting for
 
02:18:14.110 --> 02:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:15.950 --> 02:18:15.960 align:start position:0%
Bernstein there he
 
02:18:20.830 --> 02:18:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:24.750 --> 02:18:24.760 align:start position:0%
um we looked at the revenues as a
 
02:18:28.190 --> 02:18:28.200 align:start position:0%
whole and we knew the business taxes
 
02:18:30.349 --> 02:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
would be the most
 
02:18:32.950 --> 02:18:32.960 align:start position:0%
difficult and then uh the next one would
 
02:18:35.190 --> 02:18:35.200 align:start position:0%
be the meals and
 
02:18:39.830 --> 02:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:41.629 --> 02:18:41.639 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
02:18:44.830 --> 02:18:44.840 align:start position:0%
IND I'm sorry the
 
02:18:49.150 --> 02:18:49.160 align:start position:0%
re the real estate taxes
 
02:18:51.709 --> 02:18:51.719 align:start position:0%
so what I
 
02:18:54.669 --> 02:18:54.679 align:start position:0%
suggest and after talking with
 
02:18:56.790 --> 02:18:56.800 align:start position:0%
representa Aly last
 
02:19:00.709 --> 02:19:00.719 align:start position:0%
night let me go through this on the mees
 
02:19:06.389 --> 02:19:06.399 align:start position:0%
and woms tax on FY
 
02:19:11.669 --> 02:19:11.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.429 --> 02:19:16.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:16.439 --> 02:19:18.469 align:start position:0%
 
311

02:19:18.469 --> 02:19:18.479 align:start position:0%
311
 
02:19:22.030 --> 02:19:22.040 align:start position:0%
and almost like the same and I would say
 
02:19:27.150 --> 02:19:27.160 align:start position:0%
I would suggest that um
 
02:19:30.190 --> 02:19:30.200 align:start position:0%
we go with a
 
02:19:32.830 --> 02:19:32.840 align:start position:0%
311 on
 
02:19:37.589 --> 02:19:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:41.870 --> 02:19:41.880 align:start position:0%
34.5 the Democrats was
 
02:19:46.429 --> 02:19:46.439 align:start position:0%
342 I would suggest we go to
 
02:19:46.439 --> 02:19:50.750 align:start position:0%
342 I would suggest we go to
341

02:19:50.750 --> 02:19:50.760 align:start position:0%
 
02:19:53.389 --> 02:19:53.399 align:start position:0%
on FY
 
02:19:58.270 --> 02:19:58.280 align:start position:0%
23 the Republicans midpoint was 360.
 
02:20:02.110 --> 02:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
one the Democrats is
 
02:20:05.309 --> 02:20:05.319 align:start position:0%
359 I would suggest
 
02:20:05.319 --> 02:20:16.349 align:start position:0%
359 I would suggest
go

02:20:16.349 --> 02:20:16.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:21.030 --> 02:20:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:29.110 --> 02:20:29.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:33.190 --> 02:20:33.200 align:start position:0%
that almost as if we were watching each
 
02:20:33.200 --> 02:20:34.750 align:start position:0%
that almost as if we were watching each
other

02:20:34.750 --> 02:20:34.760 align:start position:0%
other
 
02:20:44.270 --> 02:20:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:20:48.710 --> 02:20:48.720 align:start position:0%

million
 
02:21:03.590 --> 02:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
322 to be $341
 
02:21:07.990 --> 02:21:08.000 align:start position:0%
million and 323 would be $360
 
02:21:11.550 --> 02:21:11.560 align:start position:0%
million I'll second

this can I just make one comment nor
 
02:22:01.150 --> 02:22:01.160 align:start position:0%
bronz so that would be that would this
 
02:22:03.670 --> 02:22:03.680 align:start position:0%
would make it 10 million for two
 
02:22:07.270 --> 02:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
20121 10 million higher than February's
 
02:22:12.309 --> 02:22:12.319 align:start position:0%
estimate uh 22 13 million and

182.5 the Democrats was 182
 
02:25:20.110 --> 02:25:20.120 align:start position:0%
the midpoint for
 
02:25:26.750 --> 02:25:26.760 align:start position:0%
the Republicans on FY 23 was 173
 
02:25:32.150 --> 02:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:35.950 --> 02:25:35.960 align:start position:0%
170 as you can see they're pretty
 
02:25:41.830 --> 02:25:41.840 align:start position:0%
close so I would make a motion about to
 
02:25:44.670 --> 02:25:44.680 align:start position:0%
pass for the revenues for Real Estate
 
02:25:47.670 --> 02:25:47.680 align:start position:0%

02:26:19.190 --> 02:26:19.200 align:start position:0%
171 just to repeat again
 
02:26:23.990 --> 02:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
194 182 and 171 are the revenue

me had her hand up first but I just
 
02:27:20.910 --> 02:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
going to make uh the same thing I did
 
02:27:24.309 --> 02:27:24.319 align:start position:0%
before uh 21 that's 2.1 above our
 
02:27:28.510 --> 02:27:28.520 align:start position:0%
February estimate uh 22 1.7 million
 
02:27:32.429 --> 02:27:32.439 align:start position:0%
above our February estimate and 23 2.2
 
02:27:35.309 --> 02:27:35.319 align:start position:0%
above our February estimate so about $2
 
02:27:40.710 --> 02:27:40.720 align:start position:0%
million a year above our February
 
02:27:44.469 --> 02:27:44.479 align:start position:0%
estimate thank you um I think that uh
 
02:27:46.950 --> 02:27:46.960 align:start position:0%
representative Lane has something to
 
02:27:49.429 --> 02:27:49.439 align:start position:0%
offer she's been talking with Ben

Frost who's um with New Hampshire
 
02:28:01.309 --> 02:28:01.319 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority he said he was
 
02:28:04.269 --> 02:28:04.279 align:start position:0%
surprised that dr's figures were going
 
02:28:06.870 --> 02:28:06.880 align:start position:0%
down um given their forecast and what
 
02:28:10.750 --> 02:28:10.760 align:start position:0%
they're seeing um and he also said that
 
02:28:13.070 --> 02:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
the single um what you call the starter
 
02:28:15.230 --> 02:28:15.240 align:start position:0%
Home Market has never really recovered
 
02:28:16.790 --> 02:28:16.800 align:start position:0%
from the Great Recession and then
 
02:28:19.389 --> 02:28:19.399 align:start position:0%
continues to be problematic and there
 
02:28:22.030 --> 02:28:22.040 align:start position:0%
are no projects that he is aware of
 
02:28:24.070 --> 02:28:24.080 align:start position:0%
large ones that they are working with
 
02:28:25.910 --> 02:28:25.920 align:start position:0%
for single family homes it was just more
 
02:28:28.550 --> 02:28:28.560 align:start position:0%
of an information that I was providing
 
02:28:32.510 --> 02:28:32.520 align:start position:0%
um uh based on comments from
 
02:28:35.870 --> 02:28:35.880 align:start position:0%
yesterday right and that's the sad fact
 
02:28:39.510 --> 02:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
for New Hampshire there the home
 
02:28:42.630 --> 02:28:42.640 align:start position:0%
construction isn't keep the the
 
02:28:45.349 --> 02:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
man and the inventory

02:28:51.750 --> 02:28:51.760 align:start position:0%
older homes is very
 
02:28:55.990 --> 02:28:56.000 align:start position:0%

02:38:44.720 --> 02:38:50.389 align:start position:0%
 
different

02:38:50.389 --> 02:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:38:58.230 --> 02:38:58.240 align:start position:0%

liquor

02:39:01.030 --> 02:39:01.040 align:start position:0%
liquor
 
02:39:04.070 --> 02:39:04.080 align:start position:0%
yeah let me
 
02:39:07.429 --> 02:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
see so so liquer came in today and said
 
02:39:10.030 --> 02:39:10.040 align:start position:0%
that um they could live with the 129
 
02:39:13.630 --> 02:39:13.640 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal year 21 and suggested
 
02:39:16.030 --> 02:39:16.040 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to go up in 22 could go up
 
02:39:16.040 --> 02:39:25.469 align:start position:0%
if you wanted to go up in 22 could go up
to

02:39:25.469 --> 02:39:25.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:25.479 --> 02:39:28.710 align:start position:0%

02:39:30.670 --> 02:39:30.680 align:start position:0%
feel should
 
02:39:33.469 --> 02:39:33.479 align:start position:0%
they go with the Liquor Commission
 
02:39:36.550 --> 02:39:36.560 align:start position:0%
should they use estimates from February
 
02:39:39.389 --> 02:39:39.399 align:start position:0%
or should they do something
 
02:39:43.110 --> 02:39:43.120 align:start position:0%
different uh represent Southwest I'd be
 
02:39:45.710 --> 02:39:45.720 align:start position:0%
comfortable just going to 138 for for
 
02:39:48.550 --> 02:39:48.560 align:start position:0%

02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:45.439 align:start position:0%

02:42:02.550 --> 02:42:02.560 align:start position:0%
passes now Chris did we have any other
 
02:42:04.910 --> 02:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
changes that we made
 
02:42:07.790 --> 02:42:07.800 align:start position:0%
prior to any of these revenues I don't
 
02:42:10.910 --> 02:42:10.920 align:start position:0%
see any the insurance provided some
 
02:42:13.510 --> 02:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
ranges today that were higher than what
 
02:42:16.910 --> 02:42:16.920 align:start position:0%
you had um pre viously
 
02:42:19.269 --> 02:42:19.279 align:start position:0%
estimated but left it to you to decide
 
02:42:20.590 --> 02:42:20.600 align:start position:0%
whether you wanted to do anything with
 
02:42:25.349 --> 02:42:25.359 align:start position:0%
that so for fiscal year 21 um they could
 
02:42:29.830 --> 02:42:29.840 align:start position:0%
see somewhere between a 128. two and 131
 
02:42:32.469 --> 02:42:32.479 align:start position:0%
million for fiscal year
 
02:42:35.070 --> 02:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
22 um they could see somewhere between
 
02:42:37.429 --> 02:42:37.439 align:start position:0%
127 and 130
 
02:42:40.429 --> 02:42:40.439 align:start position:0%
million and then for fiscal year 23 they
 
02:42:40.439 --> 02:42:42.269 align:start position:0%
million and then for fiscal year 23 they
had

02:42:42.269 --> 02:42:42.279 align:start position:0%
had
 
02:42:42.279 --> 02:42:44.349 align:start position:0%
had
133.33

02:42:44.349 --> 02:42:44.359 align:start position:0%
133.33
 
02:42:44.359 --> 02:42:46.870 align:start position:0%
133.33
million

02:42:46.870 --> 02:42:46.880 align:start position:0%
million
 
02:42:55.710 --> 02:42:55.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:58.469 --> 02:42:58.479 align:start position:0%
okay all right committee what do you
 
02:43:00.550 --> 02:43:00.560 align:start position:0%
want to do representative
 
02:43:04.469 --> 02:43:04.479 align:start position:0%
browny yeah um I asked them if they
 
02:43:06.590 --> 02:43:06.600 align:start position:0%
could live with the midpoint on the uh
 
02:43:08.269 --> 02:43:08.279 align:start position:0%
on 22 and
 
02:43:11.309 --> 02:43:11.319 align:start position:0%
23 uh they felt comfortable with the
 
02:43:14.269 --> 02:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
midpoint that would be
 
02:43:14.279 --> 02:43:15.790 align:start position:0%
midpoint that would be
128.57

02:43:15.790 --> 02:43:15.800 align:start position:0%
128.57
 
02:43:17.630 --> 02:43:17.640 align:start position:0%
and uh
 
02:43:20.349 --> 02:43:20.359 align:start position:0%
134 I'm rounding
 
02:43:24.389 --> 02:43:24.399 align:start position:0%
three uh and they also said for the
 
02:43:27.590 --> 02:43:27.600 align:start position:0%
21 they could go up as high as 131 but
 
02:43:30.150 --> 02:43:30.160 align:start position:0%
maybe we don't need to do that maybe you
 
02:43:33.110 --> 02:43:33.120 align:start position:0%
know maybe 130 or something like that so
 
02:43:37.349 --> 02:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
I I I would suggest we look at maybe
 
02:43:40.389 --> 02:43:40.399 align:start position:0%
130 uh if you want to be conservative we
 
02:43:41.590 --> 02:43:41.600 align:start position:0%
can go to
 
02:43:44.269 --> 02:43:44.279 align:start position:0%
128 and maybe
 
02:43:47.790 --> 02:43:47.800 align:start position:0%
134 so you're making a motion for that
 
02:43:49.670 --> 02:43:49.680 align:start position:0%
representative rney well let's I think
 
02:43:51.190 --> 02:43:51.200 align:start position:0%
there's going to be more discussion than
 
02:43:52.790 --> 02:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
I'll make that motion
 
02:43:55.429 --> 02:43:55.439 align:start position:0%
but representative bramy made a motion
 
02:44:00.670 --> 02:44:00.680 align:start position:0%
to going to 130 128 and 134 respectively
 
02:44:03.150 --> 02:44:03.160 align:start position:0%

30% about $36 million over plan at this
 
02:53:41.950 --> 02:53:41.960 align:start position:0%
point and he doesn't really see any
 
02:53:44.550 --> 02:53:44.560 align:start position:0%

02:53:50.630 --> 02:53:50.640 align:start position:0%

representative El
 
02:59:14.910 --> 02:59:14.920 align:start position:0%
me thank you Mr chairman um what Charlie
 
02:59:19.670 --> 02:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
told us was that he is 30% above plan at
 
02:59:26.710 --> 02:59:26.720 align:start position:0%
 
02:59:33.190 --> 02:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
110 on million so that is is about
 
02:59:38.510 --> 02:59:38.520 align:start position:0%
33 uh million dollar above plan and um
 
02:59:41.590 --> 02:59:41.600 align:start position:0%
that he doesn't really see any change
 
02:59:43.990 --> 02:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
coming but he likes to be conservative
 
02:59:46.830 --> 02:59:46.840 align:start position:0%
ative and so he's he wants to keep the
 
02:59:49.550 --> 02:59:49.560 align:start position:0%
110 I would suggest that we could we
 
02:59:51.670 --> 02:59:51.680 align:start position:0%
could take 20 million of that and stick
 
02:59:54.990 --> 02:59:55.000 align:start position:0%
it into 21 and it would not affect
 
03:00:01.349 --> 03:00:01.359 align:start position:0%
obviously 22 or 23 because on it is
 
03:00:05.830 --> 03:00:05.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:08.950 --> 03:00:08.960 align:start position:0%
Lottery okay um you're making that into
 
03:00:08.960 --> 03:00:09.750 align:start position:0%
Lottery okay um you're making that into
a

03:00:09.750 --> 03:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
a
 
03:00:13.150 --> 03:00:13.160 align:start position:0%
motion I am what why do you think this
 
03:00:17.269 --> 03:00:17.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:00:22.469 --> 03:00:22.479 align:start position:0%
because on he says that he he is now 30%
 
03:00:26.070 --> 03:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
above plan we only have uh we have four
 
03:00:29.550 --> 03:00:29.560 align:start position:0%
months left actually because uh next
 
03:00:32.910 --> 03:00:32.920 align:start position:0%
month we will get March and then we will
 
03:00:35.510 --> 03:00:35.520 align:start position:0%
get April and then we will get May and
 
03:00:41.110 --> 03:00:41.120 align:start position:0%
June together in June so on uh there's
 
03:00:44.670 --> 03:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
four months still to go but but he says
 
03:00:47.750 --> 03:00:47.760 align:start position:0%
that he is seeing growth in everything
 
03:00:50.190 --> 03:00:50.200 align:start position:0%
not just in the ones affected by the
 
03:00:52.590 --> 03:00:52.600 align:start position:0%
people who have come from Massachusetts
 
03:00:54.469 --> 03:00:54.479 align:start position:0%
to stay in their second homes in the
 
03:00:54.479 --> 03:00:55.469 align:start position:0%
to stay in their second homes in the
Lake

03:00:55.469 --> 03:00:55.479 align:start position:0%
Lake
 
03:00:58.870 --> 03:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
Region though that is part of the growth
 
03:01:02.309 --> 03:01:02.319 align:start position:0%
on and there have been two major
 
03:01:04.630 --> 03:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
jackpots equal to $10
 
03:01:07.070 --> 03:01:07.080 align:start position:0%
million in
 
03:01:12.110 --> 03:01:12.120 align:start position:0%
uh January that on we have booked which
 
03:01:15.070 --> 03:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
is anonymous it do get considered in his
 
03:01:19.229 --> 03:01:19.239 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates um but and he
 
03:01:23.110 --> 03:01:23.120 align:start position:0%
does like to be very safe about things
 
03:01:26.990 --> 03:01:27.000 align:start position:0%
but on I do think that we could book at
 
03:01:31.990 --> 03:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
least uh another 20 million onto the the
 
03:01:42.630 --> 03:01:42.640 align:start position:0%

03:03:16.469 --> 03:03:16.479 align:start position:0%
I I I didn't feel yeah but remember that
 
03:03:20.110 --> 03:03:20.120 align:start position:0%
was only because of the trillion dollar
 
03:03:24.510 --> 03:03:24.520 align:start position:0%
payout 10 was 10 million yeah billion
 
03:03:26.750 --> 03:03:26.760 align:start position:0%
dollars extra on top of
 
03:03:29.630 --> 03:03:29.640 align:start position:0%
things and I'm ask actually asking for
 
03:03:32.870 --> 03:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:35.469 --> 03:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
booked represent is only adding 10
 
03:03:37.229 --> 03:03:37.239 align:start position:0%
million on top of our last
 
03:03:42.110 --> 03:03:42.120 align:start position:0%
estimate our last estimate was uh
 
03:03:45.190 --> 03:03:45.200 align:start position:0%
12.6 I think the motion is to go to
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:56.110 --> 03:03:56.120 align:start position:0%
is I don't think that's too risky to do
 
03:03:59.630 --> 03:03:59.640 align:start position:0%
given given what what he said and what
 
03:04:03.910 --> 03:04:03.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:11.429 --> 03:04:11.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:13.670 --> 03:04:13.680 align:start position:0%
input you were kind of weake I didn't
 
03:04:15.030 --> 03:04:15.040 align:start position:0%
get to your last
 
03:04:18.830 --> 03:04:18.840 align:start position:0%
statement I'm saying given given
 
03:04:22.670 --> 03:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh Charlie McIntyre's testimony and
 
03:04:24.150 --> 03:04:24.160 align:start position:0%
looking at these
 
03:04:26.870 --> 03:04:26.880 align:start position:0%
numbers I would concur with
 
03:04:29.070 --> 03:04:29.080 align:start position:0%
representative aly's
 
03:04:34.510 --> 03:04:34.520 align:start position:0%
motion all right and that would be to go
 
03:04:34.520 --> 03:04:36.309 align:start position:0%
motion all right and that would be to go
13.6

03:04:36.309 --> 03:04:36.319 align:start position:0%
13.6
 
03:04:36.319 --> 03:04:38.030 align:start position:0%
13.6
million

03:04:38.030 --> 03:04:38.040 align:start position:0%
million
 
03:04:41.229 --> 03:04:41.239 align:start position:0%
yes uh are you seconding that motion
 
03:04:45.590 --> 03:04:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:47.630 --> 03:04:47.640 align:start position:0%
it would only apply to
 
03:04:50.950 --> 03:04:50.960 align:start position:0%
fy21 yes
 
03:04:54.150 --> 03:04:54.160 align:start position:0%
right so the motion
 
03:04:59.110 --> 03:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
is the estimate for revenue for
 
03:05:01.269 --> 03:05:01.279 align:start position:0%
fy21 would be
 
03:05:05.229 --> 03:05:05.239 align:start position:0%
13.6 million for for the lottery it was
 
03:05:08.670 --> 03:05:08.680 align:start position:0%
made by representative BR uh Aly second
 
03:05:10.830 --> 03:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
by representative
 
03:05:15.510 --> 03:05:15.520 align:start position:0%
Bron any further discussion no
 
03:05:18.750 --> 03:05:18.760 align:start position:0%
comments yeah I support this is
 
03:05:22.910 --> 03:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
representative Ames yes um well I I
 
03:05:24.630 --> 03:05:24.640 align:start position:0%
support the motion but I wonder if it
 
03:05:26.389 --> 03:05:26.399 align:start position:0%
shouldn't be expanded to include the
 
03:05:29.590 --> 03:05:29.600 align:start position:0%
next two years so we get this Lottery
 
03:05:31.990 --> 03:05:32.000 align:start position:0%
done um
 
03:05:37.830 --> 03:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
suggest yeah Mo represent Aly to
 
03:05:40.550 --> 03:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
13.6 for
 
03:05:46.190 --> 03:05:46.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:48.469 --> 03:05:48.479 align:start position:0%
25 Z for

representative Hackman Phillips I just
 
03:06:36.389 --> 03:06:36.399 align:start position:0%
received a message from representative
 
03:06:38.469 --> 03:06:38.479 align:start position:0%

03:07:01.830 --> 03:07:01.840 align:start position:0%
you that could happen to almost any
 
03:07:05.150 --> 03:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
happen to all of us here so maybe we
 
03:07:07.190 --> 03:07:07.200 align:start position:0%
ought to take since there's no
 
03:07:09.550 --> 03:07:09.560 align:start position:0%

03:09:21.030 --> 03:09:21.040 align:start position:0%
now CH can you bring your spreadsheet up
 
03:09:28.990 --> 03:09:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:31.469 --> 03:09:31.479 align:start position:0%
totals so you should be seeing the
 
03:09:31.479 --> 03:09:37.070 align:start position:0%
totals so you should be seeing the
screen

03:09:37.070 --> 03:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:09:41.910 --> 03:09:41.920 align:start position:0%
now and hopefully you can see the last
 
03:09:44.990 --> 03:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
row in the Bold is
 
03:09:48.590 --> 03:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
the um the total for the new estimates
 
03:09:50.469 --> 03:09:50.479 align:start position:0%
and then just below that is difference
 
03:09:52.670 --> 03:09:52.680 align:start position:0%
from your prior estimate so in fiscal
 
03:09:59.190 --> 03:09:59.200 align:start position:0%
year 21 you went from 2.67 4.5 to 2725
 
03:10:02.590 --> 03:10:02.600 align:start position:0%
point4 an increase of 50.9
 
03:10:06.550 --> 03:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal year 22 you went from
 
03:10:06.560 --> 03:10:08.469 align:start position:0%
million in fiscal year 22 you went from
27

03:10:08.469 --> 03:10:08.479 align:start position:0%
27
 
03:10:11.830 --> 03:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:15.790 --> 03:10:15.800 align:start position:0%
27640 an increase of 38.3
 
03:10:19.110 --> 03:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
million and then in fiscal 23 you went
 
03:10:19.120 --> 03:10:21.950 align:start position:0%
million and then in fiscal 23 you went
from

03:10:21.950 --> 03:10:21.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:21.960 --> 03:10:24.190 align:start position:0%
 
2754

03:10:24.190 --> 03:10:24.200 align:start position:0%
2754
 
03:10:27.550 --> 03:10:27.560 align:start position:0%
2.8.5 an increase of 45.1
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
million and over the three years it's a
 
03:10:32.190 --> 03:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
total increase of
 
03:10:32.200 --> 03:10:33.870 align:start position:0%
total increase of
1343

03:10:33.870 --> 03:10:33.880 align:start position:0%
1343
 
03:10:38.309 --> 03:10:38.319 align:start position:0%
million I think finance committee will
 
03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:41.840 align:start position:0%
be dancing
 
03:10:41.840 --> 03:10:43.830 align:start position:0%
be dancing
but.

03:10:43.830 --> 03:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
but.
 
03:10:47.510 --> 03:10:47.520 align:start position:0%
and rep major if I if it's okay um the
 
03:10:49.030 --> 03:10:49.040 align:start position:0%
conclusion of your meeting I'll send
 
03:10:51.269 --> 03:10:51.279 align:start position:0%
this spreadsheet out to all the
 
03:10:54.830 --> 03:10:54.840 align:start position:0%
members with a 318 date on it um so that
 
03:10:56.830 --> 03:10:56.840 align:start position:0%
you know that it was done today and I'll
 
03:11:00.710 --> 03:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
leave the end column as you see it thank
 
03:11:04.110 --> 03:11:04.120 align:start position:0%
you I would that we have one more thing
 
03:11:04.120 --> 03:11:05.110 align:start position:0%
you I would that we have one more thing
to

03:11:05.110 --> 03:11:05.120 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:11:09.870 --> 03:11:09.880 align:start position:0%
do and uh and that is to look at the and
 
03:11:13.150 --> 03:11:13.160 align:start position:0%
revenues due to legis changes so could
 
03:11:17.750 --> 03:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
you bring up that change sheet
 
03:11:23.150 --> 03:11:23.160 align:start position:0%
press um which one that show the house
 
03:11:23.160 --> 03:11:24.070 align:start position:0%
press um which one that show the house
built

03:11:24.070 --> 03:11:24.080 align:start position:0%
built
 
03:11:26.910 --> 03:11:26.920 align:start position:0%
too your your sheet from the other day
 
03:11:33.830 --> 03:11:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:36.309 --> 03:11:36.319 align:start position:0%
sharing Mr chair could I could I just
 
03:11:38.750 --> 03:11:38.760 align:start position:0%
remind all the members to hit mute we're
 
03:11:40.590 --> 03:11:40.600 align:start position:0%
getting some interference which is
 
03:11:42.269 --> 03:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
making it hard to hear so if you're not
 
03:11:46.670 --> 03:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:50.790 --> 03:11:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:53.309 --> 03:11:53.319 align:start position:0%
you so you should see on the screen now
 
03:11:55.590 --> 03:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
the sheet from yesterday the only thing
 
03:11:58.550 --> 03:11:58.560 align:start position:0%
that's different is um you had asked me
 
03:12:01.710 --> 03:12:01.720 align:start position:0%
to add the out years on the
 
03:12:01.720 --> 03:12:06.349 align:start position:0%
to add the out years on the
indd

03:12:06.349 --> 03:12:06.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:09.990 --> 03:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
yeah that would be basically um a static
 
03:12:12.269 --> 03:12:12.279 align:start position:0%
loss I guess if that's the right term
 
03:12:12.279 --> 03:12:13.389 align:start position:0%
loss I guess if that's the right term
but

03:12:13.389 --> 03:12:13.399 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:12:15.510 --> 03:12:15.520 align:start position:0%
on the idea that you would have been at
 
03:12:18.670 --> 03:12:18.680 align:start position:0%
say 120 million to start with and you
 
03:12:20.670 --> 03:12:20.680 align:start position:0%
went down by six and then it would be
 
03:12:23.429 --> 03:12:23.439 align:start position:0%
six plus whatever the next year for 24
 
03:12:24.710 --> 03:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
to get the
 
03:12:28.710 --> 03:12:28.720 align:start position:0%
28.5 just it's just so you understand
 
03:12:29.910 --> 03:12:29.920 align:start position:0%
that that's what that is so at the end
 
03:12:31.910 --> 03:12:31.920 align:start position:0%
you're gonna have zero dollars of so 116
 
03:12:35.110 --> 03:12:35.120 align:start position:0%
16.9 was the amount that was used
 
03:12:38.349 --> 03:12:38.359 align:start position:0%
because for the ones that are joining us
 
03:12:41.630 --> 03:12:41.640 align:start position:0%
right now we collect 11
 
03:12:45.870 --> 03:12:45.880 align:start position:0%
16.9 in the indd tax and facing it out
 
03:12:49.070 --> 03:12:49.080 align:start position:0%
of five years this is the numbers you
 
03:12:51.790 --> 03:12:51.800 align:start position:0%
would get so what I want to do is go
 
03:12:53.429 --> 03:12:53.439 align:start position:0%
line by
 
03:12:53.439 --> 03:12:56.670 align:start position:0%
line by
line

03:12:56.670 --> 03:12:56.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:00.950 --> 03:13:00.960 align:start position:0%
um line two which is the additional Dr
 
03:13:04.630 --> 03:13:04.640 align:start position:0%
Auditors we talked the dras and that's
 
03:13:07.389 --> 03:13:07.399 align:start position:0%
still a good number it would bring in
 
03:13:07.399 --> 03:13:08.469 align:start position:0%
still a good number it would bring in
extra

03:13:08.469 --> 03:13:08.479 align:start position:0%
extra
 
03:13:10.790 --> 03:13:10.800 align:start position:0%
$700,000 for
 
03:13:16.670 --> 03:13:16.680 align:start position:0%
fy22 and $3.2 million in FY
 
03:13:20.910 --> 03:13:20.920 align:start position:0%
23 any questions or comments on that if
 
03:13:23.830 --> 03:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
not the meals and room rate
 
03:13:27.349 --> 03:13:27.359 align:start position:0%
decrease from 9% to 8 and a
 
03:13:30.670 --> 03:13:30.680 align:start position:0%
half% you will see part of that decrease
 
03:13:30.680 --> 03:13:31.710 align:start position:0%
half% you will see part of that decrease
in

03:13:31.710 --> 03:13:31.720 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:13:35.710 --> 03:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
fy22 it reduce the revenues by $1.4
 
03:13:40.030 --> 03:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
million and by $19 million in
 
03:13:45.110 --> 03:13:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:48.710 --> 03:13:48.720 align:start position:0%
just just a comment on that one um I
 
03:13:52.150 --> 03:13:52.160 align:start position:0%
think Dr did it uh did that calculation
 
03:13:54.790 --> 03:13:54.800 align:start position:0%
and they did it on the basis
 
03:13:58.150 --> 03:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
of oh revenues a couple years ago can't
 
03:14:02.670 --> 03:14:02.680 align:start position:0%
remember um and uh now that we've got
 
03:14:05.710 --> 03:14:05.720 align:start position:0%
got actual estimated
 
03:14:08.190 --> 03:14:08.200 align:start position:0%
revenues um they should be done off of
 
03:14:09.870 --> 03:14:09.880 align:start position:0%
the estimate but as it turns out the
 
03:14:11.950 --> 03:14:11.960 align:start position:0%
estimate is about the same as that
 
03:14:11.960 --> 03:14:13.389 align:start position:0%
estimate is about the same as that
previous

03:14:13.389 --> 03:14:13.399 align:start position:0%
previous
 
03:14:16.349 --> 03:14:16.359 align:start position:0%
and it's so I I'm accepting this number
 
03:14:18.030 --> 03:14:18.040 align:start position:0%
I just thought I'd throw that
 
03:14:21.630 --> 03:14:21.640 align:start position:0%
explanation in any further moments or
 
03:14:24.110 --> 03:14:24.120 align:start position:0%
questions on this on these numbers for
 
03:14:24.120 --> 03:14:25.510 align:start position:0%
questions on this on these numbers for
the

03:14:25.510 --> 03:14:25.520 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:14:31.150 --> 03:14:31.160 align:start position:0%
bet I mean the mes and room
 
03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:35.040 align:start position:0%
reduction okay the next combines two
 
03:14:40.630 --> 03:14:40.640 align:start position:0%
changes um changing the thre to 2ou
 
03:14:43.990 --> 03:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
$250,000 and the
 
03:14:47.590 --> 03:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
gross Enterprise Value to
 
03:14:50.590 --> 03:14:50.600 align:start position:0%
$250,000 we won't have any effect
 
03:14:53.830 --> 03:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
fy22 but a reduced Revenue by $3.1
 
03:14:56.229 --> 03:14:56.239 align:start position:0%
million in
 
03:14:59.550 --> 03:14:59.560 align:start position:0%
23 any comments
 
03:15:03.349 --> 03:15:03.359 align:start position:0%
questions the next is the Mr Mr chairman
 
03:15:07.830 --> 03:15:07.840 align:start position:0%
I I just wanted Assurance I I think that
 
03:15:11.349 --> 03:15:11.359 align:start position:0%
the loss of 3.1 continues into the
 
03:15:18.790 --> 03:15:18.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:22.030 --> 03:15:22.040 align:start position:0%
correct the only way it grows is if
 
03:15:26.110 --> 03:15:26.120 align:start position:0%
there's more businesses that fall into
 
03:15:26.120 --> 03:15:27.950 align:start position:0%
there's more businesses that fall into
that

03:15:27.950 --> 03:15:27.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:15:31.469 --> 03:15:31.479 align:start position:0%
range more more
 
03:15:33.910 --> 03:15:33.920 align:start position:0%
business it would be I would think it'd
 
03:15:33.920 --> 03:15:35.349 align:start position:0%
business it would be I would think it'd
be

03:15:35.349 --> 03:15:35.359 align:start position:0%
be
 
03:15:39.950 --> 03:15:39.960 align:start position:0%
trivial the BET rate decrease from
 
03:15:43.510 --> 03:15:43.520 align:start position:0%
0.6% to 0.55
 
03:15:47.189 --> 03:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
5% you'll see part of that as they're
 
03:15:49.750 --> 03:15:49.760 align:start position:0%
implementing it fy22 will reduce
 
03:15:54.269 --> 03:15:54.279 align:start position:0%
revenues by 4.7 million and 13.3 million
 
03:15:56.990 --> 03:15:57.000 align:start position:0%
in FY
 
03:16:00.269 --> 03:16:00.279 align:start position:0%
23 Mr chairman I think that one does
 
03:16:06.030 --> 03:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:11.229 --> 03:16:11.239 align:start position:0%
years that will grow as the reeven as
 
03:16:14.790 --> 03:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:16:18.790 --> 03:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
but also as on we catch up with the
 
03:16:21.030 --> 03:16:21.040 align:start position:0%
three years
 
03:16:24.429 --> 03:16:24.439 align:start position:0%
prior yes yes there's the
 
03:16:27.510 --> 03:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
over yeah if I could make a suggestion I
 
03:16:30.630 --> 03:16:30.640 align:start position:0%
I'd like to see these these
 
03:16:33.710 --> 03:16:33.720 align:start position:0%
columns going forward from 23 for this
 
03:16:36.429 --> 03:16:36.439 align:start position:0%
one where it is significant amount of
 
03:16:39.990 --> 03:16:40.000 align:start position:0%
money populated um so that we can see
 
03:16:43.910 --> 03:16:43.920 align:start position:0%
the impact in the year years beyond the
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
two-year period of the budget I said
 
03:16:49.510 --> 03:16:49.520 align:start position:0%
that yesterday is
 
03:16:51.429 --> 03:16:51.439 align:start position:0%
m still
 
03:16:54.349 --> 03:16:54.359 align:start position:0%
there Melissa or
 
03:16:58.870 --> 03:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
carollyn Y I'm here representative major
 
03:17:03.830 --> 03:17:03.840 align:start position:0%
okay do you have the numbers on the rate
 
03:17:03.840 --> 03:17:05.670 align:start position:0%
okay do you have the numbers on the rate
decrease

03:17:05.670 --> 03:17:05.680 align:start position:0%
decrease
 
03:17:08.590 --> 03:17:08.600 align:start position:0%
.55% going out to
 
03:17:11.710 --> 03:17:11.720 align:start position:0%
2425 yep so the the final impact will be
 
03:17:14.950 --> 03:17:14.960 align:start position:0%
felt in fiscal year 24 and um it would
 
03:17:21.469 --> 03:17:21.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:26.630 --> 03:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
reduction so minus 4.7 and
 
03:17:28.990 --> 03:17:29.000 align:start position:0%
22 minus
 
03:17:29.000 --> 03:17:31.510 align:start position:0%
22 minus
13.3

03:17:31.510 --> 03:17:31.520 align:start position:0%
13.3
 
03:17:35.469 --> 03:17:35.479 align:start position:0%
23 and you're saying in 24 how much
 
03:17:39.229 --> 03:17:39.239 align:start position:0%
three uh minus 3.2 million minus 3.2
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
million is that cumulative
 
03:17:44.309 --> 03:17:44.319 align:start position:0%
that is a year-over-year
 
03:17:47.630 --> 03:17:47.640 align:start position:0%
impact the cumulative total is
 
03:17:50.710 --> 03:17:50.720 align:start position:0%
21.2 at the end of fiscal
 
03:17:53.469 --> 03:17:53.479 align:start position:0%
24 I think that's the cumulative that
 
03:17:55.230 --> 03:17:55.240 align:start position:0%
we're showing for the indd
 
03:17:55.240 --> 03:17:57.389 align:start position:0%
we're showing for the indd
[Music]

03:17:57.389 --> 03:17:57.399 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:18:00.469 --> 03:18:00.479 align:start position:0%
and isn't that what we want to
 
03:18:03.070 --> 03:18:03.080 align:start position:0%
show that's what that's correct ripson
 
03:18:04.630 --> 03:18:04.640 align:start position:0%
Ames on the indd you did show the
 
03:18:06.950 --> 03:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
cumulative that's what reps and major
 
03:18:08.469 --> 03:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
had started and that's what I continued
 
03:18:11.110 --> 03:18:11.120 align:start position:0%
on it
 
03:18:11.120 --> 03:18:13.030 align:start position:0%
on it
so

03:18:13.030 --> 03:18:13.040 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:18:13.040 --> 03:18:16.389 align:start position:0%
so
cumulative

03:18:16.389 --> 03:18:16.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:18.469 --> 03:18:18.479 align:start position:0%
on rate
 
03:18:21.269 --> 03:18:21.279 align:start position:0%
decrease also if we could get the total
 
03:18:23.950 --> 03:18:23.960 align:start position:0%
between the rate decrease and the
 
03:18:23.960 --> 03:18:27.630 align:start position:0%
between the rate decrease and the
offsetting

03:18:27.630 --> 03:18:27.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:30.030 --> 03:18:30.040 align:start position:0%
BPT so if I can ask the committee a
 
03:18:31.870 --> 03:18:31.880 align:start position:0%
question I'm not sure what screen what
 
03:18:33.910 --> 03:18:33.920 align:start position:0%
you're seeing on my screen right
 
03:18:35.950 --> 03:18:35.960 align:start position:0%
now are
 
03:18:41.110 --> 03:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:45.229 --> 03:18:45.239 align:start position:0%
the I don't know uh what document it is
 
03:18:47.550 --> 03:18:47.560 align:start position:0%
but it's a spreadsheet it's
 
03:18:47.560 --> 03:18:48.630 align:start position:0%
but it's a spreadsheet it's
representative

03:18:48.630 --> 03:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:18:52.110 --> 03:18:52.120 align:start position:0%
Majors okay so it might be helpful if I
 
03:18:54.950 --> 03:18:54.960 align:start position:0%
switch into the Dr document that has the
 
03:18:57.229 --> 03:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
information I think you're asking for so
 
03:19:07.950 --> 03:19:07.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:11.349 --> 03:19:11.359 align:start position:0%
oh all right so now you're seeing a a
 
03:19:14.790 --> 03:19:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:18.070 --> 03:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
screen I hope so it says fiscal impact
 
03:19:20.870 --> 03:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
0.55% bet rate
 
03:19:22.990 --> 03:19:23.000 align:start position:0%
change is that what you're seeing on my
 
03:19:25.550 --> 03:19:25.560 align:start position:0%
on your screen now from from my share
 
03:19:29.870 --> 03:19:29.880 align:start position:0%
yes okay so the so here is the in the
 
03:19:34.990 --> 03:19:35.000 align:start position:0%
Box 22 they assume a base of 254 million
 
03:19:36.870 --> 03:19:36.880 align:start position:0%
you're going to lose 4.6 million that
 
03:19:39.309 --> 03:19:39.319 align:start position:0%
brings you down to
 
03:19:42.830 --> 03:19:42.840 align:start position:0%
249 if you want to be make it cumulative
 
03:19:44.550 --> 03:19:44.560 align:start position:0%
in the next year it's a if you're going
 
03:19:46.750 --> 03:19:46.760 align:start position:0%
off the base you've already decreased it
 
03:19:50.950 --> 03:19:50.960 align:start position:0%
by the four million um the 4.6 million
 
03:19:54.510 --> 03:19:54.520 align:start position:0%
plus the 13.3 to get you to 236 right
 
03:19:56.990 --> 03:19:57.000 align:start position:0%
here but if you want to know if you're
 
03:19:59.189 --> 03:19:59.199 align:start position:0%
were going from the 254 you'd be losing
 
03:20:01.349 --> 03:20:01.359 align:start position:0%
18 million so there's a couple of ways
 
03:20:02.429 --> 03:20:02.439 align:start position:0%
it's been
 
03:20:06.229 --> 03:20:06.239 align:start position:0%
shown um when we would carry something
 
03:20:07.830 --> 03:20:07.840 align:start position:0%
like this on the Surplus statement we
 
03:20:11.030 --> 03:20:11.040 align:start position:0%
would do it kind of as a static analysis
 
03:20:13.550 --> 03:20:13.560 align:start position:0%
and we would say okay it's based on the
 
03:20:22.030 --> 03:20:22.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:25.429 --> 03:20:25.439 align:start position:0%
18 and then you had asked uh for the BPT
 
03:20:40.229 --> 03:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:20:45.070 --> 03:20:45.080 align:start position:0%
that so the year year yearly component
 
03:20:48.389 --> 03:20:48.399 align:start position:0%
is the 46 133 and the
 
03:20:53.710 --> 03:20:53.720 align:start position:0%
31 and the cumulative is 4 6 18 and 21
 
03:21:03.389 --> 03:21:03.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:07.150 --> 03:21:07.160 align:start position:0%
yeah and then for the BPT below you you
 
03:21:09.349 --> 03:21:09.359 align:start position:0%
have a positive of
 
03:21:13.110 --> 03:21:13.120 align:start position:0%
2.8 8.1 and then 1
 
03:21:16.910 --> 03:21:16.920 align:start position:0%
.9 in the three years and cumulative of
 
03:21:19.150 --> 03:21:19.160 align:start position:0%
12.9 overall three
 
03:21:22.910 --> 03:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
years right they go
 
03:21:27.870 --> 03:21:27.880 align:start position:0%
together yes yep total loss at the at
 
03:21:31.870 --> 03:21:31.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:31.880 --> 03:21:35.950 align:start position:0%
 
8.2

03:21:35.950 --> 03:21:35.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:40.830 --> 03:21:40.840 align:start position:0%
yep and obviously I mean this is dr's
 
03:21:42.550 --> 03:21:42.560 align:start position:0%
sheet so if I'm Miss
 
03:21:44.389 --> 03:21:44.399 align:start position:0%
um representing something I hope Melissa
 
03:21:48.990 --> 03:21:49.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:52.150 --> 03:21:52.160 align:start position:0%
but doing it perfectly
 
03:21:56.189 --> 03:21:56.199 align:start position:0%
Chris I like the vote of confidence so
 
03:21:58.990 --> 03:21:59.000 align:start position:0%
if I think you have one more showing the
 
03:22:02.309 --> 03:22:02.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:05.830 --> 03:22:05.840 align:start position:0%
together yeah I got got talking and
 
03:22:08.309 --> 03:22:08.319 align:start position:0%
didn't scroll yes so that's the 8.2 that
 
03:22:10.469 --> 03:22:10.479 align:start position:0%
represent Wy just mentioned on the
 
03:22:23.990 --> 03:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:24.000 --> 03:22:29.030 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:22:29.030 --> 03:22:29.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:33.790 --> 03:22:33.800 align:start position:0%
um now can we go back to the other sheet
 
03:22:40.309 --> 03:22:40.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:22:44.670 --> 03:22:44.680 align:start position:0%
names I yes I I I I hope that on the
 
03:22:46.309 --> 03:22:46.319 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet that we're about to see
 
03:22:49.910 --> 03:22:49.920 align:start position:0%
we'll then populate the
 
03:22:54.550 --> 03:22:54.560 align:start position:0%
U the the additional years going out U
 
03:23:01.750 --> 03:23:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:04.710 --> 03:23:04.720 align:start position:0%
indd so can
 
03:23:10.030 --> 03:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:14.030 --> 03:23:14.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:18.110 --> 03:23:18.120 align:start position:0%
um for the rate
 
03:23:20.710 --> 03:23:20.720 align:start position:0%
decrease and it also have to do it for
 
03:23:20.720 --> 03:23:22.550 align:start position:0%
decrease and it also have to do it for
the

03:23:22.550 --> 03:23:22.560 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:23:28.510 --> 03:23:28.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:33.830 --> 03:23:33.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:36.110 --> 03:23:36.120 align:start position:0%
both understood I'm just I'm having
 
03:23:37.830 --> 03:23:37.840 align:start position:0%
trouble finding the document now that
 
03:23:40.670 --> 03:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
I've switched out of
 
03:23:49.630 --> 03:23:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:53.790 --> 03:23:53.800 align:start position:0%
time I would I would say that uh this is
 
03:23:56.429 --> 03:23:56.439 align:start position:0%
important to have as backup information
 
03:23:58.070 --> 03:23:58.080 align:start position:0%
information that we can all take away
 
03:24:01.189 --> 03:24:01.199 align:start position:0%
but you know the Focus right now is on
 
03:24:06.189 --> 03:24:06.199 align:start position:0%
the fy22 and FY 23 numbers yes a task at
 
03:24:09.590 --> 03:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
hand so this doesn't need to delay us so
 
03:24:12.110 --> 03:24:12.120 align:start position:0%
can can we proceed
 
03:24:15.389 --> 03:24:15.399 align:start position:0%
and then uh we'll get that information
 
03:24:17.630 --> 03:24:17.640 align:start position:0%
exactly and sent
 
03:24:24.349 --> 03:24:24.359 align:start position:0%
out is that okay represent yes okay
 
03:24:27.910 --> 03:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
yes I think we all need to see that
 
03:24:31.229 --> 03:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
information that's why I extended some
 
03:24:35.110 --> 03:24:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:39.429 --> 03:24:39.439 align:start position:0%
um the next line you offsetting BPT
 
03:24:42.710 --> 03:24:42.720 align:start position:0%
Revenue increases when you
 
03:24:45.309 --> 03:24:45.319 align:start position:0%
have due to the rate decrease you have
 
03:24:45.319 --> 03:24:46.189 align:start position:0%
have due to the rate decrease you have
less

03:24:46.189 --> 03:24:46.199 align:start position:0%
less
 
03:24:49.510 --> 03:24:49.520 align:start position:0%
bet and then you're using less bet as
 
03:24:51.670 --> 03:24:51.680 align:start position:0%
credit against the
 
03:24:56.830 --> 03:24:56.840 align:start position:0%
BPT and that would when you did
 
03:25:00.550 --> 03:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
that the BPT Revenue decrease now if you
 
03:25:02.670 --> 03:25:02.680 align:start position:0%
have less credit against the
 
03:25:06.590 --> 03:25:06.600 align:start position:0%
BPT then the business tax revenues
 
03:25:10.030 --> 03:25:10.040 align:start position:0%
increases so the offsetting shows that
 
03:25:12.389 --> 03:25:12.399 align:start position:0%
when you have 4.7
 
03:25:16.110 --> 03:25:16.120 align:start position:0%
milon offset it increases the BPT
 
03:25:20.429 --> 03:25:20.439 align:start position:0%
Revenue by 2.8 because not all
 
03:25:22.389 --> 03:25:22.399 align:start position:0%
dollars uh
 
03:25:26.550 --> 03:25:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:25:30.150 --> 03:25:30.160 align:start position:0%
BET are offsetting BPT because there's a
 
03:25:33.830 --> 03:25:33.840 align:start position:0%
number of businesses that pay bet but
 
03:25:36.910 --> 03:25:36.920 align:start position:0%
don't have any BPT so that's why those
 
03:25:39.990 --> 03:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
numbers aren't the same in the second
 
03:25:42.110 --> 03:25:42.120 align:start position:0%
year the minus
 
03:25:46.389 --> 03:25:46.399 align:start position:0%
.3 million reduction in the BET affects
 
03:25:50.750 --> 03:25:50.760 align:start position:0%
the BPT by 8.1 million
 
03:25:54.469 --> 03:25:54.479 align:start position:0%
increase so I have confidence that uh Dr
 
03:25:58.030 --> 03:25:58.040 align:start position:0%
has has done this they they know the
 
03:26:00.590 --> 03:26:00.600 align:start position:0%
inside story so I think
 
03:26:04.550 --> 03:26:04.560 align:start position:0%
it this all makes sense to me the next
 
03:26:08.229 --> 03:26:08.239 align:start position:0%
is the indd tax reduction over fiveyear
 
03:26:11.469 --> 03:26:11.479 align:start position:0%
phase out it doesn't affect the first
 
03:26:14.030 --> 03:26:14.040 align:start position:0%
first year but it starts in the second
 
03:26:16.950 --> 03:26:16.960 align:start position:0%
year and this is the cumulative effect
 
03:26:16.960 --> 03:26:18.990 align:start position:0%
year and this is the cumulative effect
each

03:26:18.990 --> 03:26:19.000 align:start position:0%
each
 
03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:22.880 align:start position:0%
year but for our purposes it affects FY
 
03:26:24.910 --> 03:26:24.920 align:start position:0%
23 and
 
03:26:27.229 --> 03:26:27.239 align:start position:0%
FY FY
 
03:26:31.750 --> 03:26:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:31.760 --> 03:26:35.229 align:start position:0%
 
ready

03:26:35.229 --> 03:26:35.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:40.389 --> 03:26:40.399 align:start position:0%
um the next is the single sales Factor
 
03:26:40.399 --> 03:26:42.349 align:start position:0%
um the next is the single sales Factor
delay

03:26:42.349 --> 03:26:42.359 align:start position:0%
delay
 
03:26:48.550 --> 03:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
that puts restores back the $20 million
 
03:26:52.229 --> 03:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
that we put out when we had to use Cur
 
03:26:56.150 --> 03:26:56.160 align:start position:0%
current law this puts that $20 million
 
03:26:59.830 --> 03:26:59.840 align:start position:0%
back because we're pushing that
 
03:27:04.830 --> 03:27:04.840 align:start position:0%
implementation implementation out a few
 
03:27:08.950 --> 03:27:08.960 align:start position:0%
years the next is the historic
 
03:27:12.309 --> 03:27:12.319 align:start position:0%
racing uh that's House Bill 62
 
03:27:16.030 --> 03:27:16.040 align:start position:0%
6 they plan on putting that into
 
03:27:19.550 --> 03:27:19.560 align:start position:0%
hb2 that goes through it will increase
 
03:27:24.510 --> 03:27:24.520 align:start position:0%
revenues by $6.4 million fy22 and 12
 
03:27:29.910 --> 03:27:29.920 align:start position:0%
million FY 23 nor Norm representative
 
03:27:33.189 --> 03:27:33.199 align:start position:0%
Bron yeah I think uh I think part of
 
03:27:34.990 --> 03:27:35.000 align:start position:0%
conversation with Charlie he he's now
 
03:27:37.630 --> 03:27:37.640 align:start position:0%
saying six million and 12 million six
 
03:27:40.510 --> 03:27:40.520 align:start position:0%
million instead of 12 okay 6 million
 
03:27:43.469 --> 03:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
instead of the 6 4 and then 12 million
 
03:27:45.070 --> 03:27:45.080 align:start position:0%
the next
 
03:27:48.550 --> 03:27:48.560 align:start position:0%
year that 6.4 to
 
03:27:52.389 --> 03:27:52.399 align:start position:0%
6.0 so um just rep major I'm sorry just
 
03:27:55.790 --> 03:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
so the committee understands um in the
 
03:27:57.189 --> 03:27:57.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal note worksheet that the
 
03:27:59.950 --> 03:27:59.960 align:start position:0%
department provided us they had 6.4 and
 
03:28:02.750 --> 03:28:02.760 align:start position:0%
12.9 so when you see a fiscal note come
 
03:28:07.309 --> 03:28:07.319 align:start position:0%
out on this bill um it will have the 6.4
 
03:28:10.030 --> 03:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
and 12.9 and it should also show
 
03:28:12.590 --> 03:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
expenditures of about 6 100,000 um each
 
03:28:16.630 --> 03:28:16.640 align:start position:0%
year associated with implementing this
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
but I only say that because the finance
 
03:28:21.429 --> 03:28:21.439 align:start position:0%
committee may take the information they
 
03:28:23.269 --> 03:28:23.279 align:start position:0%
got in the revised fiscal note that was
 
03:28:26.990 --> 03:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
requested and use the 6.4 and the 12.9
 
03:28:29.389 --> 03:28:29.399 align:start position:0%
when they do their Surplus statement but
 
03:28:31.189 --> 03:28:31.199 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll let them know that the
 
03:28:34.030 --> 03:28:34.040 align:start position:0%
committee has um after conversations
 
03:28:38.389 --> 03:28:38.399 align:start position:0%
with um director McIntyre indicated six
 
03:28:41.349 --> 03:28:41.359 align:start position:0%
and 12 would be a better Revenue number
 
03:28:44.510 --> 03:28:44.520 align:start position:0%
okay yeah can I speak that
 
03:28:46.309 --> 03:28:46.319 align:start position:0%
representative bronley again that point
 
03:28:49.630 --> 03:28:49.640 align:start position:0%
n is is the the the money that that's
 
03:28:53.910 --> 03:28:53.920 align:start position:0%
directed towards the uh problem gambling
 
03:28:57.349 --> 03:28:57.359 align:start position:0%
fund um and somehow it got originally
 
03:29:00.269 --> 03:29:00.279 align:start position:0%
got put in here as 12.9 but it really is
 
03:29:02.950 --> 03:29:02.960 align:start position:0%
12 in in their fiscal note they talk
 
03:29:07.389 --> 03:29:07.399 align:start position:0%
about the about the that money and when
 
03:29:10.150 --> 03:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
I look at the fiscal note the math works
 
03:29:12.469 --> 03:29:12.479 align:start position:0%
I mean it's it's 12 million
 
03:29:15.349 --> 03:29:15.359 align:start position:0%
to uh the education trust fund and
 
03:29:18.830 --> 03:29:18.840 align:start position:0%
change and then there's about 800 800
 
03:29:22.830 --> 03:29:22.840 align:start position:0%
between 800 900 in the uh going to the
 
03:29:26.950 --> 03:29:26.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:29.030 --> 03:29:29.040 align:start position:0%
gambling I just want
 
03:29:29.040 --> 03:29:31.830 align:start position:0%
gambling I just want
to

03:29:31.830 --> 03:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:29:34.030 --> 03:29:34.040 align:start position:0%
say represent
 
03:29:39.229 --> 03:29:39.239 align:start position:0%
Ames um yeah um the uh I feel I I I need
 
03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:43.120 align:start position:0%
to comment because I engaged in a
 
03:29:45.790 --> 03:29:45.800 align:start position:0%
exchange with director McIntyre on this
 
03:29:47.910 --> 03:29:47.920 align:start position:0%
and I just want to say that I his
 
03:29:51.150 --> 03:29:51.160 align:start position:0%
explanation was sufficient for me and uh
 
03:29:55.309 --> 03:29:55.319 align:start position:0%
so I think uh these are good numbers if
 
03:29:57.990 --> 03:29:58.000 align:start position:0%
we're going forward with this
 
03:30:01.710 --> 03:30:01.720 align:start position:0%
uh this initiative um of course I've got
 
03:30:03.550 --> 03:30:03.560 align:start position:0%
a different perspective on whether we
 
03:30:05.750 --> 03:30:05.760 align:start position:0%
should go forward with it but that's not
 
03:30:07.990 --> 03:30:08.000 align:start position:0%
what we're talking about
 
03:30:12.510 --> 03:30:12.520 align:start position:0%
here Mr chairman represent
 
03:30:15.070 --> 03:30:15.080 align:start position:0%
thank you uh I was confused about what
 
03:30:18.269 --> 03:30:18.279 align:start position:0%
he was saying it sounded like uh the
 
03:30:21.990 --> 03:30:22.000 align:start position:0%
current problem G gaming Council
 
03:30:25.070 --> 03:30:25.080 align:start position:0%
whatever it's called has only a couple
 
03:30:28.349 --> 03:30:28.359 align:start position:0%
of tens of thousands of dollars coming
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:43.150 --> 03:30:43.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:45.750 --> 03:30:45.760 align:start position:0%
I I don't know the answer to
 
03:30:50.189 --> 03:30:50.199 align:start position:0%
that all I know is his estimates of what
 
03:30:54.269 --> 03:30:54.279 align:start position:0%
has been it will raise a 6 million and
 
03:30:54.279 --> 03:30:56.710 align:start position:0%
has been it will raise a 6 million and
12

03:30:56.710 --> 03:30:56.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:00.670 --> 03:31:00.680 align:start position:0%
million and as far as the distribution
 
03:31:07.309 --> 03:31:07.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:11.790 --> 03:31:11.800 align:start position:0%
that's this is Mr chair so I have the
 
03:31:13.469 --> 03:31:13.479 align:start position:0%
fiscal note right in front of me there's
 
03:31:15.469 --> 03:31:15.479 align:start position:0%
a line that says estimated
 
03:31:18.990 --> 03:31:19.000 align:start position:0%
breakage which is 15% a handle to be
 
03:31:21.910 --> 03:31:21.920 align:start position:0%
used for problem gambling services and
 
03:31:26.229 --> 03:31:26.239 align:start position:0%
they have the figure of 821 point2 uh
 
03:31:26.239 --> 03:31:28.830 align:start position:0%
they have the figure of 821 point2 uh
821

03:31:28.830 --> 03:31:28.840 align:start position:0%
821
 
03:31:31.429 --> 03:31:31.439 align:start position:0%
,250 each of the
 
03:31:34.990 --> 03:31:35.000 align:start position:0%
years so but then we decided to PR rate
 
03:31:37.309 --> 03:31:37.319 align:start position:0%
that because
 
03:31:41.910 --> 03:31:41.920 align:start position:0%
of uh it would that would be prated but
 
03:31:44.550 --> 03:31:44.560 align:start position:0%
again it's it's it's what's in going to
 
03:31:46.670 --> 03:31:46.680 align:start position:0%
the what's you know some of this may
 
03:31:48.309 --> 03:31:48.319 align:start position:0%
wind up in the general fund May wind up
 
03:31:52.229 --> 03:31:52.239 align:start position:0%
in education trust fund I guess we just
 
03:31:52.239 --> 03:31:53.070 align:start position:0%
in education trust fund I guess we just
don't

03:31:53.070 --> 03:31:53.080 align:start position:0%
don't
 
03:31:57.189 --> 03:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
know uh but it's but in in the fiscal
 
03:31:59.990 --> 03:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
note it's all pointed to the uh problem
 
03:32:00.000 --> 03:32:01.469 align:start position:0%
note it's all pointed to the uh problem
gambling

03:32:01.469 --> 03:32:01.479 align:start position:0%
gambling
 
03:32:01.479 --> 03:32:03.150 align:start position:0%
gambling
services

03:32:03.150 --> 03:32:03.160 align:start position:0%
services
 
03:32:06.790 --> 03:32:06.800 align:start position:0%
so so but this is a conservative I guess
 
03:32:08.670 --> 03:32:08.680 align:start position:0%
you could cons you could say the 12
 
03:32:14.790 --> 03:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:18.030 --> 03:32:18.040 align:start position:0%
and yes representative Aly some of it
 
03:32:21.990 --> 03:32:22.000 align:start position:0%
may I I don't know it must lapse but I I
 
03:32:24.510 --> 03:32:24.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know how that fund
 
03:32:27.189 --> 03:32:27.199 align:start position:0%
works yeah it would be nice to try to
 
03:32:29.429 --> 03:32:29.439 align:start position:0%
find out if we're going to be expanding
 
03:32:31.550 --> 03:32:31.560 align:start position:0%

Horse

03:32:39.830 --> 03:32:39.840 align:start position:0%
Horse
 
03:32:39.840 --> 03:32:43.830 align:start position:0%
Horse
Rising

03:32:43.830 --> 03:32:43.840 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:48.790 --> 03:32:48.800 align:start position:0%
and then on line 11 I I'm going to skip
 
03:32:51.790 --> 03:32:51.800 align:start position:0%
the carry forward but on line 11 you
 
03:32:55.750 --> 03:32:55.760 align:start position:0%
have House Bill 591 that uh representa
 
03:32:59.670 --> 03:32:59.680 align:start position:0%
obber wanted me to put in there uh the
 
03:33:02.110 --> 03:33:02.120 align:start position:0%
liquor license fees and that generates
 
03:33:07.349 --> 03:33:07.359 align:start position:0%
$35 A5 million doar each year positive
 
03:33:10.550 --> 03:33:10.560 align:start position:0%
can I can I speak to that Norm yes yeah
 
03:33:12.389 --> 03:33:12.399 align:start position:0%
this this is the bill that we worked on
 
03:33:14.790 --> 03:33:14.800 align:start position:0%
last year uh that got didn't make it
 
03:33:17.990 --> 03:33:18.000 align:start position:0%
through it corrects the the the $6
 
03:33:21.070 --> 03:33:21.080 align:start position:0%
problem there are 174 businesses that
 
03:33:24.389 --> 03:33:24.399 align:start position:0%
are only paying $6 for a tobacco
 
03:33:27.590 --> 03:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
license uh but in reality and I can't
 
03:33:29.630 --> 03:33:29.640 align:start position:0%
remember the exact number uh the our
 
03:33:31.990 --> 03:33:32.000 align:start position:0%
bill increased it I refiled the bill
 
03:33:35.870 --> 03:33:35.880 align:start position:0%
this year it went to Edna they approved
 
03:33:39.269 --> 03:33:39.279 align:start position:0%
it then it went to finance it went to
 
03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
finance because originally we had had
 
03:33:43.469 --> 03:33:43.479 align:start position:0%
two positions in there if you
 
03:33:46.910 --> 03:33:46.920 align:start position:0%
recall uh but Edna actually took the two
 
03:33:49.030 --> 03:33:49.040 align:start position:0%
positions out so technically it didn't
 
03:33:50.469 --> 03:33:50.479 align:start position:0%
really need to go to
 
03:33:53.710 --> 03:33:53.720 align:start position:0%
finance I I was in communication when we
 
03:33:55.030 --> 03:33:55.040 align:start position:0%
we said representative Alber were're
 
03:33:57.150 --> 03:33:57.160 align:start position:0%
talking about Lyn Alber not not
 
03:34:00.110 --> 03:34:00.120 align:start position:0%
Russ uh when I talked to Lynn about this
 
03:34:03.910 --> 03:34:03.920 align:start position:0%
because she had uh had uh retained all
 
03:34:06.710 --> 03:34:06.720 align:start position:0%
of the bills that came to her division
 
03:34:08.750 --> 03:34:08.760 align:start position:0%
uh second committee bills and I reached
 
03:34:10.070 --> 03:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
out to her and I said well I don't know
 
03:34:13.110 --> 03:34:13.120 align:start position:0%
if you really want to retain this one uh
 
03:34:15.189 --> 03:34:15.199 align:start position:0%
there's really no work here it's we're
 
03:34:16.990 --> 03:34:17.000 align:start position:0%
increasing the fees to where they should
 
03:34:20.710 --> 03:34:20.720 align:start position:0%
be and it's going to generate about
 
03:34:23.349 --> 03:34:23.359 align:start position:0%
$336,000 uh and I I guess she heard me
 
03:34:23.359 --> 03:34:24.710 align:start position:0%
$336,000 uh and I I guess she heard me
because

03:34:24.710 --> 03:34:24.720 align:start position:0%
because
 
03:34:28.269 --> 03:34:28.279 align:start position:0%
now uh she's uh wanted to see that back
 
03:34:32.389 --> 03:34:32.399 align:start position:0%
in here so so that's the the long
 
03:34:34.550 --> 03:34:34.560 align:start position:0%
version of the story I
 
03:34:37.710 --> 03:34:37.720 align:start position:0%
guess but that that increase of for
 
03:34:40.189 --> 03:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
those 174 businesses will equate to
 
03:34:42.710 --> 03:34:42.720 align:start position:0%
about 30 6 million
 
03:34:46.309 --> 03:34:46.319 align:start position:0%
36 million not million 36
 
03:34:48.670 --> 03:34:48.680 align:start position:0%
3,000,000 thank
 
03:34:52.150 --> 03:34:52.160 align:start position:0%
you right each year each
 
03:34:52.160 --> 03:34:54.229 align:start position:0%

03:34:59.389 --> 03:34:59.399 align:start position:0%
have any questions on what we've
 
03:35:01.910 --> 03:35:01.920 align:start position:0%

03:35:09.710 --> 03:35:09.720 align:start position:0%
forward what I would like to do is is
 
03:35:11.950 --> 03:35:11.960 align:start position:0%
get an acceptance
 
03:35:16.309 --> 03:35:16.319 align:start position:0%
on all of that except for the line
 
03:35:20.630 --> 03:35:20.640 align:start position:0%
10 and then that's a whole discussion
 
03:35:23.790 --> 03:35:23.800 align:start position:0%
that I'd like to carry on
 
03:35:26.710 --> 03:35:26.720 align:start position:0%

industry

03:37:37.870 --> 03:37:37.880 align:start position:0%

okay can I make a a my my comment is
related

03:37:42.750 --> 03:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
related
 
03:37:46.030 --> 03:37:46.040 align:start position:0%
to what was just said
 
03:37:49.910 --> 03:37:49.920 align:start position:0%
um and it is that my understanding of
 
03:37:49.920 --> 03:37:50.830 align:start position:0%
um and it is that my understanding of
this

03:37:50.830 --> 03:37:50.840 align:start position:0%
this
 
03:37:54.269 --> 03:37:54.279 align:start position:0%
motion is that it re relates solely to
 
03:37:56.070 --> 03:37:56.080 align:start position:0%
the Cal
 
03:37:59.389 --> 03:37:59.399 align:start position:0%
calculation of Revenue impact of these
 
03:38:01.590 --> 03:38:01.600 align:start position:0%
various Provisions that are in house
 
03:38:04.389 --> 03:38:04.399 align:start position:0%
build two and if house build two passes
 
03:38:06.630 --> 03:38:06.640 align:start position:0%
with them this is what the impact will
 
03:38:10.510 --> 03:38:10.520 align:start position:0%
be exactly and that it it does not in
 
03:38:15.309 --> 03:38:15.319 align:start position:0%
any way carry with it a suggestion by
 
03:38:17.830 --> 03:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
any one of us that we
 
03:38:23.269 --> 03:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:29.830 --> 03:38:29.840 align:start position:0%
proposal is that correct yes yes so for
 
03:38:33.030 --> 03:38:33.040 align:start position:0%
example Hospital 626 has been mentioned
 
03:38:35.870 --> 03:38:35.880 align:start position:0%
but I'll mention a different one the
 
03:38:38.910 --> 03:38:38.920 align:start position:0%
phase out of the IND
 
03:38:40.830 --> 03:38:40.840 align:start position:0%
TX I'm
 
03:38:44.229 --> 03:38:44.239 align:start position:0%
quite ready to vote on that one and on
 
03:38:47.070 --> 03:38:47.080 align:start position:0%
626 on the revenue
 
03:38:52.389 --> 03:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
impact and in doing so I'm not conveying
 
03:38:52.399 --> 03:38:53.349 align:start position:0%
impact and in doing so I'm not conveying
my

03:38:53.349 --> 03:38:53.359 align:start position:0%
my
 
03:38:57.429 --> 03:38:57.439 align:start position:0%
position one way or the other on those
 
03:38:58.670 --> 03:38:58.680 align:start position:0%
or any of the
 
03:39:01.830 --> 03:39:01.840 align:start position:0%
others Mr chair maybe we just change the
 
03:39:03.630 --> 03:39:03.640 align:start position:0%
language of the
 
03:39:09.229 --> 03:39:09.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:09.239 --> 03:39:10.950 align:start position:0%
 
that

03:39:10.950 --> 03:39:10.960 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:39:13.830 --> 03:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
to accept the revenue
 
03:39:16.469 --> 03:39:16.479 align:start position:0%
impact of the
 
03:39:19.349 --> 03:39:19.359 align:start position:0%
items on that
 
03:39:22.150 --> 03:39:22.160 align:start position:0%
spreadsheet right I just want to make
 
03:39:23.870 --> 03:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
sure representative Ames is
 
03:39:25.710 --> 03:39:25.720 align:start position:0%
satisfied I don't know if you have other
 
03:39:27.630 --> 03:39:27.640 align:start position:0%
words that you think would be more
 
03:39:29.469 --> 03:39:29.479 align:start position:0%
reflective of that we're just voting on
 
03:39:32.590 --> 03:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
the revenues and not the substance of I
 
03:39:34.590 --> 03:39:34.600 align:start position:0%
think the way yes I think the way the
 
03:39:39.150 --> 03:39:39.160 align:start position:0%
chair just uh referenced it is is just
 
03:39:43.269 --> 03:39:43.279 align:start position:0%
fine with backed up by this
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
discussion so the motion is to accept
 
03:39:50.070 --> 03:39:50.080 align:start position:0%
the revenue
 
03:39:53.229 --> 03:39:53.239 align:start position:0%
estimates on the spreadsheet except
 
03:39:55.710 --> 03:39:55.720 align:start position:0%
for that dealing with the business
 
03:39:59.030 --> 03:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
profits tax credit carry
 
03:40:03.309 --> 03:40:03.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:06.070 --> 03:40:06.080 align:start position:0%
estimates point of order yes
 
03:40:08.510 --> 03:40:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative sou um can't
 
03:40:10.750 --> 03:40:10.760 align:start position:0%
representative Lane vote on beh half of
 
03:40:10.760 --> 03:40:13.429 align:start position:0%
representative Lane vote on beh half of
her

03:40:13.429 --> 03:40:13.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:16.030 --> 03:40:16.040 align:start position:0%
constituents again only on the numbers
 
03:40:18.389 --> 03:40:18.399 align:start position:0%
she's not voting on any of the
 
03:40:20.750 --> 03:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
bills right if she's here she's gonna
 
03:40:21.910 --> 03:40:21.920 align:start position:0%
have to
 
03:40:26.910 --> 03:40:26.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:29.830 --> 03:40:29.840 align:start position:0%
other representa lane did you understand
 
03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:32.590 align:start position:0%
other representa lane did you understand
what

03:40:32.590 --> 03:40:32.600 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:40:35.469 --> 03:40:35.479 align:start position:0%
represent I don't I guess I need to be
 
03:40:39.110 --> 03:40:39.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:39.120 --> 03:40:48.870 align:start position:0%
 
abstain

03:40:48.870 --> 03:40:48.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:51.750 --> 03:40:51.760 align:start position:0%
Jordan yes I think she's correct uh she
 
03:40:56.269 --> 03:40:56.279 align:start position:0%
has an option as a a member to declare
 
03:40:58.229 --> 03:40:58.239 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and vote or declare
 
03:41:01.110 --> 03:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest and not vote it's
 
03:41:01.120 --> 03:41:02.070 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest and not vote it's
her

03:41:02.070 --> 03:41:02.080 align:start position:0%
her
 
03:41:05.030 --> 03:41:05.040 align:start position:0%
choice uh on the floor the same thing
 
03:41:07.389 --> 03:41:07.399 align:start position:0%
would apply here she's declaring a
 
03:41:11.510 --> 03:41:11.520 align:start position:0%
conflict of interest and and not voting
 
03:41:13.670 --> 03:41:13.680 align:start position:0%
which is what Paul's told us that the
 
03:41:16.229 --> 03:41:16.239 align:start position:0%
house rules now are applying to the
 
03:41:19.950 --> 03:41:19.960 align:start position:0%
committee rules so if you take what the
 
03:41:23.349 --> 03:41:23.359 align:start position:0%
house rules are and apply it to the
 
03:41:25.790 --> 03:41:25.800 align:start position:0%
committee representative Lane has an
 
03:41:29.389 --> 03:41:29.399 align:start position:0%
option of not voting by abstaining with
 
03:41:32.149 --> 03:41:32.159 align:start position:0%
a conflict of interest on
 
03:41:34.870 --> 03:41:34.880 align:start position:0%
file and as an attorney or or working
 
03:41:38.229 --> 03:41:38.239 align:start position:0%
for a law firm I think she's correct
 
03:41:43.670 --> 03:41:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:46.990 --> 03:41:47.000 align:start position:0%
so are we
 
03:41:49.830 --> 03:41:49.840 align:start position:0%
represent had your hand up you lowered
 
03:41:49.840 --> 03:41:51.070 align:start position:0%
represent had your hand up you lowered
it

03:41:51.070 --> 03:41:51.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
03:41:54.349 --> 03:41:54.359 align:start position:0%
okay so if you vote represent Aaron has
 
03:41:56.469 --> 03:41:56.479 align:start position:0%
her hand up
 
03:42:00.870 --> 03:42:00.880 align:start position:0%
represent yes thank you Mr chair as I
 
03:42:03.269 --> 03:42:03.279 align:start position:0%
understand uh from attending other
 
03:42:07.349 --> 03:42:07.359 align:start position:0%
committees um in the case of someone not
 
03:42:10.229 --> 03:42:10.239 align:start position:0%
being able to vote due to a conflict
 
03:42:13.910 --> 03:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
interest they simply leave the room
 
03:42:15.790 --> 03:42:15.800 align:start position:0%
because if you are in the room when
 
03:42:18.910 --> 03:42:18.920 align:start position:0%
there is a vote uh taking place you
 
03:42:22.469 --> 03:42:22.479 align:start position:0%
either have to vote Yes or no um there
 
03:42:26.110 --> 03:42:26.120 align:start position:0%
is no exstension that I am aware
 
03:42:29.550 --> 03:42:29.560 align:start position:0%
of that is
 
03:42:31.590 --> 03:42:31.600 align:start position:0%
correct leave the
 
03:42:34.550 --> 03:42:34.560 align:start position:0%
room no no but the difference was Paul
 
03:42:36.590 --> 03:42:36.600 align:start position:0%
said that what we had been doing in the
 
03:42:39.630 --> 03:42:39.640 align:start position:0%
past no longer applies because we're now
 
03:42:39.640 --> 03:42:40.750 align:start position:0%
past no longer applies because we're now
doing

03:42:40.750 --> 03:42:40.760 align:start position:0%
doing
 
03:42:42.750 --> 03:42:42.760 align:start position:0%
what we do on the house floor we're
 
03:42:45.030 --> 03:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
doing in
 
03:42:47.670 --> 03:42:47.680 align:start position:0%
committee yes and then on the house
 
03:42:50.429 --> 03:42:50.439 align:start position:0%
floor you cannot leave the room when
 
03:42:52.990 --> 03:42:53.000 align:start position:0%
there's a vote you have to either vote
 
03:42:56.910 --> 03:42:56.920 align:start position:0%
Yes or no so in the case of where you
 
03:42:59.469 --> 03:42:59.479 align:start position:0%
would abstain or not wish to vote you
 
03:43:02.590 --> 03:43:02.600 align:start position:0%
would have to leave the room that's no
 
03:43:04.870 --> 03:43:04.880 align:start position:0%
that's incorrect you're noticing
 
03:43:08.870 --> 03:43:08.880 align:start position:0%
yourself as a as having a conflict of
 
03:43:08.880 --> 03:43:10.550 align:start position:0%
yourself as a as having a conflict of
interest

03:43:10.550 --> 03:43:10.560 align:start position:0%
interest
 
03:43:12.910 --> 03:43:12.920 align:start position:0%
and that's that's what the the point is
 
03:43:14.790 --> 03:43:14.800 align:start position:0%
that's what representative Lane is doing
 
03:43:17.229 --> 03:43:17.239 align:start position:0%
she's trying to do the right thing no I
 
03:43:18.910 --> 03:43:18.920 align:start position:0%
understand that and I applaud her and I
 
03:43:21.030 --> 03:43:21.040 align:start position:0%
thank her for
 
03:43:21.040 --> 03:43:22.990 align:start position:0%
thank her for
that

03:43:22.990 --> 03:43:23.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:43:25.750 --> 03:43:25.760 align:start position:0%
okay why don't I take the prerogative
 
03:43:29.830 --> 03:43:29.840 align:start position:0%
here and saying that if you don't want
 
03:43:31.990 --> 03:43:32.000 align:start position:0%
to something in there that you don't
 
03:43:37.550 --> 03:43:37.560 align:start position:0%
want to support then just leave the
 
03:43:41.630 --> 03:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
room or perhaps just turn off her video
 
03:43:44.469 --> 03:43:44.479 align:start position:0%
yes turn our camera off for a few
 
03:43:48.070 --> 03:43:48.080 align:start position:0%
minutes goodbye
 
03:43:51.670 --> 03:43:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:56.229 --> 03:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
enough okay um all right any further
 
03:43:58.950 --> 03:43:58.960 align:start position:0%
discussion on the motion just one
 
03:44:01.510 --> 03:44:01.520 align:start position:0%

04:17:14.189 --> 04:17:14.199 align:start position:0%
the votes that aren't very controversial
 
04:17:16.630 --> 04:17:16.640 align:start position:0%
I'm not a real stickler on it but any
 
04:17:18.790 --> 04:17:18.800 align:start position:0%
close votes I'd appreciate if you could
 
04:17:21.870 --> 04:17:21.880 align:start position:0%
speak up if the video is not on and give
 
04:17:24.349 --> 04:17:24.359 align:start position:0%
me another set of eyes so to speak I'm a
 
04:17:26.790 --> 04:17:26.800 align:start position:0%
quiet person I said I don't see her but
 
04:17:26.800 --> 04:17:28.149 align:start position:0%
quiet person I said I don't see her but
it's

04:17:28.149 --> 04:17:28.159 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:17:31.429 --> 04:17:31.439 align:start position:0%
overwhelmed just a comment no I did I
 
04:17:35.269 --> 04:17:35.279 align:start position:0%
did see her uh when she was Voting so I
 
04:17:37.389 --> 04:17:37.399 align:start position:0%
I don't recall her not being on vot on
 
04:17:39.870 --> 04:17:39.880 align:start position:0%
video when she was Voting what you saw
 
04:17:46.469 --> 04:17:46.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:17:48.990 --> 04:17:49.000 align:start position:0%
voting so she must have been really
 
04:17:53.109 --> 04:17:53.119 align:start position:0%
quick about turning it on and off
 
04:17:56.349 --> 04:17:56.359 align:start position:0%
yeah a lot of people do that bir Jean
 
04:17:58.189 --> 04:17:58.199 align:start position:0%
these are really different kinds of
 
04:18:01.870 --> 04:18:01.880 align:start position:0%
votes um in a way uh we would have
 
04:18:03.950 --> 04:18:03.960 align:start position:0%
normally just raised our hands if we had
 
04:18:06.830 --> 04:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
been uh in conquered so it's not really
 
04:18:08.670 --> 04:18:08.680 align:start position:0%
quite the
 
04:18:14.830 --> 04:18:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:18.030 --> 04:18:18.040 align:start position:0%
your say that again
 
04:18:21.149 --> 04:18:21.159 align:start position:0%
Tom I said to Russ I said one of those
 
04:18:23.030 --> 04:18:23.040 align:start position:0%
cats didn't cross in front of his screen
 
04:18:25.710 --> 04:18:25.720 align:start position:0%
at the time did
 
04:18:28.309 --> 04:18:28.319 align:start position:0%
it he has six of them so the odds are
 
04:18:30.269 --> 04:18:30.279 align:start position:0%
pretty good one of them
 
04:18:35.710 --> 04:18:35.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:18:35.720 --> 04:19:05.630 align:start position:0%
 
mouth

04:19:05.630 --> 04:19:05.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:05.640 --> 04:19:20.790 align:start position:0%
 
for

04:19:20.790 --> 04:19:20.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:25.830 --> 04:19:25.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.630 --> 04:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:35.640 --> 04:19:43.950 align:start position:0%
 
water

04:19:43.950 --> 04:19:43.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:49.590 --> 04:19:49.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:19:59.790 --> 04:19:59.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:02.389 --> 04:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
does just an update it sounds like
 
04:20:04.870 --> 04:20:04.880 align:start position:0%
representative Murphy saw a truck in
 
04:20:07.550 --> 04:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
front of his home so like a power truck
 
04:20:10.070 --> 04:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
so sounds like they're they should have
 
04:20:11.429 --> 04:20:11.439 align:start position:0%
power again
 
04:20:19.670 --> 04:20:19.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:23.550 --> 04:20:23.560 align:start position:0%
good couldn't you vote with with h your
 
04:20:27.950 --> 04:20:27.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:27.960 --> 04:20:29.870 align:start position:0%
 
FaceTime

04:20:29.870 --> 04:20:29.880 align:start position:0%
FaceTime
 
04:20:32.389 --> 04:20:32.399 align:start position:0%
yes it seems to me we ought to have that
 
04:20:34.830 --> 04:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
as a fallback
 
04:20:37.349 --> 04:20:37.359 align:start position:0%
position it's too bad to put in all the
 
04:20:41.070 --> 04:20:41.080 align:start position:0%
time and not get not
 
04:20:43.429 --> 04:20:43.439 align:start position:0%
devoted and I do think it's impressive
 
04:20:51.550 --> 04:20:51.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:20:54.070 --> 04:20:54.080 align:start position:0%
unanimity he might I mean he could use
 
04:20:55.750 --> 04:20:55.760 align:start position:0%
zoom on his phone he wouldn't even have
 
04:20:57.990 --> 04:20:58.000 align:start position:0%
to call in and use
 
04:21:00.070 --> 04:21:00.080 align:start position:0%
FaceTime I'm not sure he has the app
 
04:21:02.109 --> 04:21:02.119 align:start position:0%
downloaded but I could I'll recommend
 
04:21:04.590 --> 04:21:04.600 align:start position:0%
that to him okay I think it'd be nice to
 
04:21:10.229 --> 04:21:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:13.590 --> 04:21:13.600 align:start position:0%
Janine can you let Carolyn leer and
 
04:21:25.870 --> 04:21:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:30.990 --> 04:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
yep is Karen rounds part of no no she's
 
04:21:32.389 --> 04:21:32.399 align:start position:0%
someone else
 
04:21:34.510 --> 04:21:34.520 align:start position:0%
right I don't
 
04:21:38.229 --> 04:21:38.239 align:start position:0%
know she HHS
 
04:21:41.429 --> 04:21:41.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:44.670 --> 04:21:44.680 align:start position:0%
HHS do we need
 
04:21:47.420 --> 04:21:47.430 align:start position:0%
HHS I'm just interested in what we're
 
04:21:47.430 --> 04:21:51.910 align:start position:0%
HHS I'm just interested in what we're
[Music]

04:21:51.910 --> 04:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:21:55.830 --> 04:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
doing and Adam kpo I don't know who he
 
04:22:05.349 --> 04:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:05.359 --> 04:22:06.910 align:start position:0%
 
though

04:22:06.910 --> 04:22:06.920 align:start position:0%
though
 
04:22:08.830 --> 04:22:08.840 align:start position:0%
Chris do you have
 
04:22:12.030 --> 04:22:12.040 align:start position:0%
a the document
 
04:22:16.189 --> 04:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
V yeah I can put that up
 
04:22:20.229 --> 04:22:20.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:22:25.469 --> 04:22:25.479 align:start position:0%
Ames Mrs Jenny can you hear me yeah um
 
04:22:28.189 --> 04:22:28.199 align:start position:0%
it's it's your feedback that everyone is
 
04:22:30.750 --> 04:22:30.760 align:start position:0%
hearing and I don't know what to do to
 
04:22:34.710 --> 04:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
fix it but it seems like maybe when you
 
04:22:37.790 --> 04:22:37.800 align:start position:0%
sit back it's better better than when
 
04:22:37.800 --> 04:22:39.149 align:start position:0%
sit back it's better better than when
you're

04:22:39.149 --> 04:22:39.159 align:start position:0%
you're
 
04:22:42.429 --> 04:22:42.439 align:start position:0%
close I I don't know
 
04:22:45.910 --> 04:22:45.920 align:start position:0%
but if Norms trying to talk while yours
 
04:22:49.510 --> 04:22:49.520 align:start position:0%
is squelching it's hard to hear him so
 
04:22:52.149 --> 04:22:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's why I I mute you but you do talk
 
04:22:53.870 --> 04:22:53.880 align:start position:0%
a lot so I try not
 
04:22:56.309 --> 04:22:56.319 align:start position:0%
to yeah I don't hear the feedback at
 
04:22:58.229 --> 04:22:58.239 align:start position:0%
this end so I don't realize it but I
 
04:23:03.870 --> 04:23:03.880 align:start position:0%
appreciate the feedback from you and um
 
04:23:05.790 --> 04:23:05.800 align:start position:0%
I think maybe maybe I can turn down the
 
04:23:07.870 --> 04:23:07.880 align:start position:0%
volume that might help I don't I don't
 
04:23:08.870 --> 04:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
really have
 
04:23:15.269 --> 04:23:15.279 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:18.910 --> 04:23:18.920 align:start position:0%
you your names are real
 
04:23:21.590 --> 04:23:21.600 align:start position:0%
techy I don't think
 
04:23:24.710 --> 04:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
so and this year I'm perfectly in the
 
04:23:27.670 --> 04:23:27.680 align:start position:0%
the average age of the the House of
 
04:23:30.550 --> 04:23:30.560 align:start position:0%
Representatives I'll be 61 in two months
 
04:23:33.790 --> 04:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
so I'm in the
 
04:23:41.229 --> 04:23:41.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:44.469 --> 04:23:44.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:48.030 --> 04:23:48.040 align:start position:0%
age is that the mean the median or the
 
04:23:50.870 --> 04:23:50.880 align:start position:0%
mode uh Paul Smith said it was the
 
04:23:56.030 --> 04:23:56.040 align:start position:0%
average so I don't know I it's probably
 
04:23:58.269 --> 04:23:58.279 align:start position:0%
not the mean I wouldn't think we need
 
04:24:02.349 --> 04:24:02.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:05.189 --> 04:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
here in a lot of
 
04:24:05.199 --> 04:24:06.790 align:start position:0%
here in a lot of
ways

04:24:06.790 --> 04:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
ways
 
04:24:08.670 --> 04:24:08.680 align:start position:0%
yeah we got to figure out how to pay for
 
04:24:08.680 --> 04:24:09.469 align:start position:0%
yeah we got to figure out how to pay for
him

04:24:09.469 --> 04:24:09.479 align:start position:0%
him
 
04:24:12.510 --> 04:24:12.520 align:start position:0%
because at 18 or 19 or whatever he is
 
04:24:12.520 --> 04:24:13.630 align:start position:0%
because at 18 or 19 or whatever he is
you

04:24:13.630 --> 04:24:13.640 align:start position:0%
you
 
04:24:18.429 --> 04:24:18.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:22.349 --> 04:24:22.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:24.990 --> 04:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
lockerman he's got I think two kids of
 
04:24:28.550 --> 04:24:28.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:31.229 --> 04:24:31.239 align:start position:0%
right and Willis left our committee
 
04:24:33.149 --> 04:24:33.159 align:start position:0%
because he didn't have the time for it
 
04:24:35.870 --> 04:24:35.880 align:start position:0%
with his job that paid him so that was
 
04:24:38.790 --> 04:24:38.800 align:start position:0%
sad I thought it was sad Willis is a
 
04:24:52.309 --> 04:24:52.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:24:56.790 --> 04:24:56.800 align:start position:0%
like I was going to U get a picture of
 
04:25:01.910 --> 04:25:01.920 align:start position:0%
my latest or my newest and only great
 
04:25:01.920 --> 04:25:03.590 align:start position:0%
my latest or my newest and only great
great

04:25:03.590 --> 04:25:03.600 align:start position:0%
great
 
04:25:06.870 --> 04:25:06.880 align:start position:0%
granddaughter but uh oh great and have
 
04:25:09.630 --> 04:25:09.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:13.630 --> 04:25:13.640 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:13.640 --> 04:25:15.229 align:start position:0%
 
yet

04:25:15.229 --> 04:25:15.239 align:start position:0%
yet
 
04:25:20.109 --> 04:25:20.119 align:start position:0%
oh my great great granddaughter is uh is
 
04:25:21.469 --> 04:25:21.479 align:start position:0%
Bor the
 
04:25:21.479 --> 04:25:24.670 align:start position:0%
Bor the
ninth

04:25:24.670 --> 04:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:29.229 --> 04:25:29.239 align:start position:0%
so 7 pound 14 ounces 21 inches long you
 
04:25:29.239 --> 04:25:30.109 align:start position:0%
so 7 pound 14 ounces 21 inches long you
got

04:25:30.109 --> 04:25:30.119 align:start position:0%
got
 
04:25:33.990 --> 04:25:34.000 align:start position:0%
it CU guess who else had those
 
04:25:36.429 --> 04:25:36.439 align:start position:0%
statistics that's how I remember it
 
04:25:37.990 --> 04:25:38.000 align:start position:0%
that's what I
 
04:25:41.550 --> 04:25:41.560 align:start position:0%
was they named her Jenny though
 
04:25:50.070 --> 04:25:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:54.309 --> 04:25:54.319 align:start position:0%
 
04:25:58.229 --> 04:25:58.239 align:start position:0%
Mary all right uh I think we should
 
04:26:00.950 --> 04:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:00.960 --> 04:26:04.990 align:start position:0%
 
started

04:26:04.990 --> 04:26:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:08.469 --> 04:26:08.479 align:start position:0%
Melissa Melissa with
 
04:26:10.269 --> 04:26:10.279 align:start position:0%
us I
 
04:26:15.469 --> 04:26:15.479 align:start position:0%
am good um can you update us on this new
 
04:26:17.990 --> 04:26:18.000 align:start position:0%
document that you put together at our
 
04:26:24.990 --> 04:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:28.389 --> 04:26:28.399 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
04:26:33.950 --> 04:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:37.990 --> 04:26:38.000 align:start position:0%
the the effect
 
04:26:40.309 --> 04:26:40.319 align:start position:0%
of reducing a credit
 
04:26:44.229 --> 04:26:44.239 align:start position:0%
carry forward number that has grown to
 
04:26:47.550 --> 04:26:47.560 align:start position:0%
more than a quarter of a billion
 
04:26:53.710 --> 04:26:53.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:26:58.710 --> 04:26:58.720 align:start position:0%
and looks like and I'll let you explain
 
04:27:02.590 --> 04:27:02.600 align:start position:0%
it sure page3 it looks like you spread
 
04:27:02.600 --> 04:27:04.910 align:start position:0%
it sure page3 it looks like you spread
it

04:27:04.910 --> 04:27:04.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:09.070 --> 04:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
out doesn't hit you very much in any one
 
04:27:09.080 --> 04:27:10.590 align:start position:0%
out doesn't hit you very much in any one
particular

04:27:10.590 --> 04:27:10.600 align:start position:0%
particular
 
04:27:15.790 --> 04:27:15.800 align:start position:0%
year as compared to if we went right to
 
04:27:15.800 --> 04:27:19.030 align:start position:0%
year as compared to if we went right to
the

04:27:19.030 --> 04:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:27:22.590 --> 04:27:22.600 align:start position:0%
50% yes if you could work walk us
 
04:27:25.349 --> 04:27:25.359 align:start position:0%
through through this appreciate
 
04:27:28.189 --> 04:27:28.199 align:start position:0%
it sure so this is the memo that I went
 
04:27:30.389 --> 04:27:30.399 align:start position:0%
over yesterday and after we went over
 
04:27:32.990 --> 04:27:33.000 align:start position:0%
the memo yesterday there were some
 
04:27:34.910 --> 04:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
additional requests to see if we could
 
04:27:37.189 --> 04:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
spread this out so it was less of an
 
04:27:39.790 --> 04:27:39.800 align:start position:0%
impact in one particular in one
 
04:27:43.469 --> 04:27:43.479 align:start position:0%
particular year we um in the limited
 
04:27:46.590 --> 04:27:46.600 align:start position:0%
time we had we did try to run different
 
04:27:50.269 --> 04:27:50.279 align:start position:0%
scenarios and the one that we found
 
04:27:52.750 --> 04:27:52.760 align:start position:0%
limited the most is the third option
 
04:27:54.670 --> 04:27:54.680 align:start position:0%
that you uh were just referencing
 
04:27:57.349 --> 04:27:57.359 align:start position:0%
representative major would you like me
 
04:28:01.550 --> 04:28:01.560 align:start position:0%
to cover the the the um three options I
 
04:28:03.349 --> 04:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
went over yesterday or do you just want
 
04:28:05.429 --> 04:28:05.439 align:start position:0%
me to cover the additional option today
 
04:28:07.790 --> 04:28:07.800 align:start position:0%
I don't cover all three
 
04:28:07.800 --> 04:28:09.590 align:start position:0%
I don't cover all three
options

04:28:09.590 --> 04:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
options
 
04:28:12.990 --> 04:28:13.000 align:start position:0%
sure because we do have some new people
 
04:28:13.000 --> 04:28:15.990 align:start position:0%
sure because we do have some new people
here

04:28:15.990 --> 04:28:16.000 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:28:20.510 --> 04:28:20.520 align:start position:0%
perfect so the first option on page one
 
04:28:22.309 --> 04:28:22.319 align:start position:0%
Chris if you can I think it's Chris's
 
04:28:24.309 --> 04:28:24.319 align:start position:0%
screen if you can scroll up perfectly
 
04:28:26.269 --> 04:28:26.279 align:start position:0%
yeah y just yell to me what you need me
 
04:28:28.990 --> 04:28:29.000 align:start position:0%
to where you need me to be Melissa great
 
04:28:34.309 --> 04:28:34.319 align:start position:0%
thank you um so what this this chart
 
04:28:36.910 --> 04:28:36.920 align:start position:0%
here is is what is in hb2 which is
 
04:28:39.990 --> 04:28:40.000 align:start position:0%
essentially limiting a credit carryover
 
04:28:45.429 --> 04:28:45.439 align:start position:0%
by 50% of the the tax 50% of taxpayers
 
04:28:48.429 --> 04:28:48.439 align:start position:0%
tax year liability this data is based on
 
04:28:49.550 --> 04:28:49.560 align:start position:0%
tax year
 
04:28:52.149 --> 04:28:52.159 align:start position:0%
2018 for the new members that are here
 
04:28:54.070 --> 04:28:54.080 align:start position:0%
today I'll just quickly explain to you
 
04:28:56.429 --> 04:28:56.439 align:start position:0%
what a credit carryover is so this can
 
04:28:59.469 --> 04:28:59.479 align:start position:0%
can sort of make sense to you um what a
 
04:29:02.910 --> 04:29:02.920 align:start position:0%
credit carryover is is when a
 
04:29:06.830 --> 04:29:06.840 align:start position:0%
taxpayer has a tax liability on file
 
04:29:09.389 --> 04:29:09.399 align:start position:0%
they pay that tax liability and
 
04:29:11.389 --> 04:29:11.399 align:start position:0%
essentially they end up paying too much
 
04:29:14.429 --> 04:29:14.439 align:start position:0%
money so if you overpay your liability
 
04:29:15.950 --> 04:29:15.960 align:start position:0%
it becomes an overpayment and then you
 
04:29:18.389 --> 04:29:18.399 align:start position:0%
have two options for those funds one you
 
04:29:21.670 --> 04:29:21.680 align:start position:0%
can take them as a refund or two you can
 
04:29:24.269 --> 04:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
ask those funds to be carried forward to
 
04:29:27.309 --> 04:29:27.319 align:start position:0%
the next year I just want to caveat that
 
04:29:29.149 --> 04:29:29.159 align:start position:0%
with although it says credit this does
 
04:29:31.109 --> 04:29:31.119 align:start position:0%
not mean any of our previous credits
 
04:29:33.910 --> 04:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
that we've talked about bet credits Coos
 
04:29:35.429 --> 04:29:35.439 align:start position:0%
accounting credits that's different this
 
04:29:37.950 --> 04:29:37.960 align:start position:0%
is excess cash that was paid against a
 
04:29:40.429 --> 04:29:40.439 align:start position:0%
liability and is now requested to be
 
04:29:42.630 --> 04:29:42.640 align:start position:0%
carried forward to the next tax year to
 
04:29:45.309 --> 04:29:45.319 align:start position:0%
offset future
 
04:29:47.630 --> 04:29:47.640 align:start position:0%
liabilities so in
 
04:29:51.149 --> 04:29:51.159 align:start position:0%
hb2 there's a request to limit this cap
 
04:30:02.469 --> 04:30:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:05.189 --> 04:30:05.199 align:start position:0%
279.50 per of the taxpayers tax
 
04:30:05.199 --> 04:30:06.429 align:start position:0%
279.50 per of the taxpayers tax
liability

04:30:06.429 --> 04:30:06.439 align:start position:0%
liability
 
04:30:10.309 --> 04:30:10.319 align:start position:0%
so if we use tax year 2018 data you can
 
04:30:12.990 --> 04:30:13.000 align:start position:0%
look at the different ranges below I'll
 
04:30:15.269 --> 04:30:15.279 align:start position:0%
note that there's different ranges
 
04:30:17.790 --> 04:30:17.800 align:start position:0%
because we don't know exactly when are
 
04:30:19.870 --> 04:30:19.880 align:start position:0%
the taxpayer will request These funds
 
04:30:21.469 --> 04:30:21.479 align:start position:0%
there's a couple of options they can
 
04:30:25.229 --> 04:30:25.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:30:27.630 --> 04:30:27.640 align:start position:0%
payments and not make those estimate
 
04:30:30.830 --> 04:30:30.840 align:start position:0%
payments and use their credit on file to
 
04:30:33.109 --> 04:30:33.119 align:start position:0%
supplement those estimate payments and
 
04:30:35.429 --> 04:30:35.439 align:start position:0%
then get a refund on the return or they
 
04:30:36.830 --> 04:30:36.840 align:start position:0%
could could continue their normal
 
04:30:39.389 --> 04:30:39.399 align:start position:0%
behavior make estimate
 
04:30:43.389 --> 04:30:43.399 align:start position:0%
payments and then request the total
 
04:30:47.510 --> 04:30:47.520 align:start position:0%
50% once the return is filed so because
 
04:30:49.630 --> 04:30:49.640 align:start position:0%
we haven't this hasn't been in law this
 
04:30:53.149 --> 04:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
is a A New Concept we put ranges to make
 
04:30:55.670 --> 04:30:55.680 align:start position:0%
sure we sort of captured where the
 
04:30:59.189 --> 04:30:59.199 align:start position:0%
taxpayer may make adjustments to their
 
04:31:03.550 --> 04:31:03.560 align:start position:0%
returns so in 22 you can see if they
 
04:31:06.670 --> 04:31:06.680 align:start position:0%
don't adjust any of their estimates
 
04:31:09.349 --> 04:31:09.359 align:start position:0%
um there would be no impact but if they
 
04:31:11.950 --> 04:31:11.960 align:start position:0%
do make adjustments to their estimates
 
04:31:16.109 --> 04:31:16.119 align:start position:0%
there could be potentially 30.2 million
 
04:31:20.269 --> 04:31:20.279 align:start position:0%
impact and then this carries on in 23 24
 
04:31:23.109 --> 04:31:23.119 align:start position:0%
and 25 what I do want to know on this is
 
04:31:25.030 --> 04:31:25.040 align:start position:0%
the total difference at the end has to
 
04:31:27.630 --> 04:31:27.640 align:start position:0%
equal 137.5 million because that would
 
04:31:29.510 --> 04:31:29.520 align:start position:0%
be the total reduction of
 
04:31:34.710 --> 04:31:34.720 align:start position:0%
50% of the um using 50% of the cap so
 
04:31:36.109 --> 04:31:36.119 align:start position:0%
whether where you picking the range the
 
04:31:39.149 --> 04:31:39.159 align:start position:0%
bottom number does have to Total to
 
04:31:41.670 --> 04:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
137.0 so that was our starting point
 
04:31:44.389 --> 04:31:44.399 align:start position:0%
that's what's in our fiscal note for hb2
 
04:31:46.950 --> 04:31:46.960 align:start position:0%
we then created additional scenarios
 
04:31:49.550 --> 04:31:49.560 align:start position:0%
based on this impact being so large as
 
04:31:52.990 --> 04:31:53.000 align:start position:0%
you can see in 2024 that7 Million number
 
04:31:54.830 --> 04:31:54.840 align:start position:0%
is is pretty
 
04:31:58.309 --> 04:31:58.319 align:start position:0%
big let me interrupt there the reason
 
04:32:01.309 --> 04:32:01.319 align:start position:0%
why we asked for different
 
04:32:03.670 --> 04:32:03.680 align:start position:0%
scenarios in year
 
04:32:07.790 --> 04:32:07.800 align:start position:0%
2023 it could have an imp of $86
 
04:32:14.109 --> 04:32:14.119 align:start position:0%
million or in year 24 impact of $17
 
04:32:18.109 --> 04:32:18.119 align:start position:0%
million from either 20 million or
 
04:32:22.469 --> 04:32:22.479 align:start position:0%
107 and that's would be disastrous for
 
04:32:26.710 --> 04:32:26.720 align:start position:0%
us so so is there some way of fixing
 
04:32:31.510 --> 04:32:31.520 align:start position:0%
this that it doesn't shake things up as
 
04:32:34.830 --> 04:32:34.840 align:start position:0%
as much go ahead sure so Chris if you
 
04:32:37.030 --> 04:32:37.040 align:start position:0%
just want to SC scroll down not all the
 
04:32:38.870 --> 04:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
way just to get those alternative
 
04:32:43.189 --> 04:32:43.199 align:start position:0%
options perfect um so next we talked
 
04:32:45.149 --> 04:32:45.159 align:start position:0%
about different options and what we did
 
04:32:48.109 --> 04:32:48.119 align:start position:0%
share with the committee um the other
 
04:32:52.229 --> 04:32:52.239 align:start position:0%
day was that or yesterday was that some
 
04:32:55.429 --> 04:32:55.439 align:start position:0%
taxpayers have in excess of 100% of
 
04:32:58.630 --> 04:32:58.640 align:start position:0%
their liability on file um so we gave
 
04:33:00.990 --> 04:33:01.000 align:start position:0%
you just some stats on here for quick
 
04:33:02.750 --> 04:33:02.760 align:start position:0%
reference I won't go through them but
 
04:33:04.429 --> 04:33:04.439 align:start position:0%
just know that they are in your memo and
 
04:33:05.910 --> 04:33:05.920 align:start position:0%
they give you
 
04:33:08.869 --> 04:33:08.879 align:start position:0%
100 200% above their tax liability in
 
04:33:12.189 --> 04:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
credit carryovers 250 and then 500% and
 
04:33:15.070 --> 04:33:15.080 align:start position:0%
then we you later used those numbers um
 
04:33:17.310 --> 04:33:17.320 align:start position:0%
further down but just so you have those
 
04:33:18.910 --> 04:33:18.920 align:start position:0%
numbers in front of
 
04:33:24.029 --> 04:33:24.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:26.510 --> 04:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
Chris I do see Hands raised so I'm not
 
04:33:27.590 --> 04:33:27.600 align:start position:0%
sure if you want me to take those
 
04:33:29.869 --> 04:33:29.879 align:start position:0%
questions now before I go to the next
 
04:33:34.349 --> 04:33:34.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:33:37.830 --> 04:33:37.840 align:start position:0%
question yes thank you Mr chair uh and
 
04:33:39.910 --> 04:33:39.920 align:start position:0%
thank you Miss Rollins uh I'm interested
 
04:33:45.109 --> 04:33:45.119 align:start position:0%
to know for money that uh is is held by
 
04:33:49.949 --> 04:33:49.959 align:start position:0%
Dr so to speak uh for this
 
04:33:53.390 --> 04:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
overpayment is is there any interest
 
04:33:55.429 --> 04:33:55.439 align:start position:0%
that's tacked on to that do they acrew
 
04:33:57.349 --> 04:33:57.359 align:start position:0%
any interest for the money that you have
 
04:33:59.510 --> 04:33:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's that's their
 
04:33:59.520 --> 04:34:01.629 align:start position:0%
that's that's their
over

04:34:01.629 --> 04:34:01.639 align:start position:0%
over
 
04:34:06.109 --> 04:34:06.119 align:start position:0%
payment so they do not in the reason is
 
04:34:07.390 --> 04:34:07.400 align:start position:0%
is this
 
04:34:09.470 --> 04:34:09.480 align:start position:0%
overpayment um I should have stated this
 
04:34:11.590 --> 04:34:11.600 align:start position:0%
before too this overpayment we don't
 
04:34:14.470 --> 04:34:14.480 align:start position:0%
know if it's getting used regularly um
 
04:34:16.269 --> 04:34:16.279 align:start position:0%
we think it is so essentially they keep
 
04:34:18.109 --> 04:34:18.119 align:start position:0%
it on file they use it to supplement
 
04:34:20.390 --> 04:34:20.400 align:start position:0%
some of their tax and then they renew it
 
04:34:22.709 --> 04:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
each time so it's not essentially old
 
04:34:25.551 --> 04:34:25.561 align:start position:0%
money on file it gets refreshed every
 
04:34:28.910 --> 04:34:28.920 align:start position:0%
single year so it is not earning
 
04:34:32.109 --> 04:34:32.119 align:start position:0%
interest okay thank you welcome
 
04:34:32.119 --> 04:34:34.269 align:start position:0%
interest okay thank you welcome

04:34:40.869 --> 04:34:40.879 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you um I don't this may not
 
04:34:44.029 --> 04:34:44.039 align:start position:0%
be the right time for this I um it's and
 
04:34:46.750 --> 04:34:46.760 align:start position:0%
I'm perfectly fine with waiting until
 
04:34:49.510 --> 04:34:49.520 align:start position:0%
Melissa Rollins completes her
 
04:34:52.551 --> 04:34:52.561 align:start position:0%
explanation but I I I do want to put
 
04:34:56.070 --> 04:34:56.080 align:start position:0%
forward it uh an appropriate time and
 
04:34:59.949 --> 04:34:59.959 align:start position:0%
alternative to trying to create a a a
 
04:35:02.590 --> 04:35:02.600 align:start position:0%
formula um similar to what's in front of
 
04:35:06.269 --> 04:35:06.279 align:start position:0%
us um and the alternative would be
 
04:35:09.750 --> 04:35:09.760 align:start position:0%
to uh to propose an amendment to House
 
04:35:12.910 --> 04:35:12.920 align:start position:0%
Bill 2 that would establish a committee
 
04:35:17.349 --> 04:35:17.359 align:start position:0%
or a commission to review um and make
 
04:35:20.869 --> 04:35:20.879 align:start position:0%
recommendations after public hearings um
 
04:35:25.709 --> 04:35:25.719 align:start position:0%
on this issue um and I can I can speak
 
04:35:28.830 --> 04:35:28.840 align:start position:0%
and explain more about that but uh
 
04:35:31.429 --> 04:35:31.439 align:start position:0%
that's why I had my hand up yeah why
 
04:35:34.070 --> 04:35:34.080 align:start position:0%
don't you do that after she she gets
 
04:35:39.230 --> 04:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:35:42.910 --> 04:35:42.920 align:start position:0%
fine all right great so this option we
 
04:35:46.109 --> 04:35:46.119 align:start position:0%
did talk about yesterday this is another
 
04:35:48.709 --> 04:35:48.719 align:start position:0%
option and this is where we cap those
 
04:35:50.750 --> 04:35:50.760 align:start position:0%
Credit carryovers in hb2 remember it was
 
04:35:54.230 --> 04:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
50% in this option we sort of do a phase
 
04:35:57.189 --> 04:35:57.199 align:start position:0%
in approach where we cap it at 200% of
 
04:35:59.869 --> 04:35:59.879 align:start position:0%
the tax liability for tax year 22 and
 
04:36:02.709 --> 04:36:02.719 align:start position:0%
then we progressively go down 100% and
 
04:36:07.029 --> 04:36:07.039 align:start position:0%
23 of the liability 75% of the liability
 
04:36:10.429 --> 04:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
in 24 and then the 50% that's in hb2 in
 
04:36:13.470 --> 04:36:13.480 align:start position:0%
tax year 25 so this approach is phased
 
04:36:16.429 --> 04:36:16.439 align:start position:0%
in and you can see now in this one if
 
04:36:18.230 --> 04:36:18.240 align:start position:0%
you look at the max numbers throughout
 
04:36:22.109 --> 04:36:22.119 align:start position:0%
the year uh fiscal year 24 instead of
 
04:36:24.990 --> 04:36:25.000 align:start position:0%
being 107 million in the previous
 
04:36:27.429 --> 04:36:27.439 align:start position:0%
analysis that I just gave it's 45
 
04:36:29.590 --> 04:36:29.600 align:start position:0%
million in this analysis still big
 
04:36:33.029 --> 04:36:33.039 align:start position:0%
numbers but it is a a smaller approach
 
04:36:35.429 --> 04:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
and your end bottom line is still 100
 
04:36:38.390 --> 04:36:38.400 align:start position:0%
37.3 because it still ends at that 50%
 
04:36:42.590 --> 04:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:45.551 --> 04:36:45.561 align:start position:0%
ccos if there are no questions I'll go
 
04:36:49.709 --> 04:36:49.719 align:start position:0%
to the next option we spoke about
 
04:36:53.269 --> 04:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
yesterday so this option like the prior
 
04:36:56.029 --> 04:36:56.039 align:start position:0%
option starts at 200% but this one would
 
04:36:58.990 --> 04:36:59.000 align:start position:0%
end the cap at 100% of the taxpayers tax
 
04:37:02.390 --> 04:37:02.400 align:start position:0%
liability where hb2 ends it at
 
04:37:07.230 --> 04:37:07.240 align:start position:0%
50% this one has similar impacts of the
 
04:37:12.709 --> 04:37:12.719 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:14.670 --> 04:37:14.680 align:start position:0%
you sen of
 
04:37:17.750 --> 04:37:17.760 align:start position:0%
Comm great all
 
04:37:21.310 --> 04:37:21.320 align:start position:0%
right this is where we are can you
 
04:37:23.189 --> 04:37:23.199 align:start position:0%
identify who that is
 
04:37:26.750 --> 04:37:26.760 align:start position:0%
and muted anybody unmuted except Melissa
 
04:37:26.760 --> 04:37:28.429 align:start position:0%
and muted anybody unmuted except Melissa
and

04:37:28.429 --> 04:37:28.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:37:33.390 --> 04:37:33.400 align:start position:0%
yourself that's odd okay I'll keep going
 
04:37:35.510 --> 04:37:35.520 align:start position:0%
um so
 
04:37:38.551 --> 04:37:38.561 align:start position:0%
this one has similar impacts that the
 
04:37:41.670 --> 04:37:41.680 align:start position:0%
previous analysis did except the bottom
 
04:37:44.629 --> 04:37:44.639 align:start position:0%
line if you can see instead of being
 
04:37:48.470 --> 04:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
137.5 million or excuse me 137.5 million
 
04:37:48.480 --> 04:37:49.230 align:start position:0%
137.5 million or excuse me 137.5 million
it's

04:37:49.230 --> 04:37:49.240 align:start position:0%
it's
 
04:37:51.750 --> 04:37:51.760 align:start position:0%
92.3 million because you're stopping at
 
04:37:55.029 --> 04:37:55.039 align:start position:0%
that 100% versus the
 
04:37:57.709 --> 04:37:57.719 align:start position:0%
50% so those are the options we went
 
04:38:01.789 --> 04:38:01.799 align:start position:0%
over yesterday and then we came up with
 
04:38:04.670 --> 04:38:04.680 align:start position:0%
this other option based on some feedback
 
04:38:07.429 --> 04:38:07.439 align:start position:0%
from from the committee yesterday um we
 
04:38:08.830 --> 04:38:08.840 align:start position:0%
had to make it a little bit bigger and
 
04:38:10.949 --> 04:38:10.959 align:start position:0%
go out further years to make the impacts
 
04:38:15.269 --> 04:38:15.279 align:start position:0%
not so great so this impact we cap it we
 
04:38:19.551 --> 04:38:19.561 align:start position:0%
start it at being capped at 500% so I
 
04:38:21.390 --> 04:38:21.400 align:start position:0%
know that sounds a lot but taxpayers do
 
04:38:24.990 --> 04:38:25.000 align:start position:0%
have have those funds on file so we cap
 
04:38:28.670 --> 04:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
it at 500% of the tax liability in 2022
 
04:38:31.310 --> 04:38:31.320 align:start position:0%
and then again we phase it in to
 
04:38:34.709 --> 04:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
250 in 2025 so we skip two years and
 
04:38:36.590 --> 04:38:36.600 align:start position:0%
then we do another two-year delay which
 
04:38:37.910 --> 04:38:37.920 align:start position:0%
is what the committee talked about
 
04:38:41.510 --> 04:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday and we cap it at 100% in
 
04:38:44.551 --> 04:38:44.561 align:start position:0%
2027 so again this one the final impact
 
04:38:47.310 --> 04:38:47.320 align:start position:0%
is the same as the last analysis at 92.3
 
04:38:49.830 --> 04:38:49.840 align:start position:0%
million however you can see that the
 
04:38:52.269 --> 04:38:52.279 align:start position:0%
approach is maybe a little bit more
 
04:38:55.189 --> 04:38:55.199 align:start position:0%
palatable um as the highest impact
 
04:38:57.830 --> 04:38:57.840 align:start position:0%
wouldn't occur until 2029 at the high
 
04:38:58.990 --> 04:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
end would be
 
04:39:03.429 --> 04:39:03.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:06.230 --> 04:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
million happy to answer any questions on
 
04:39:11.029 --> 04:39:11.039 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:14.750 --> 04:39:14.760 align:start position:0%
Janan yes thank you Mr chairman
 
04:39:17.349 --> 04:39:17.359 align:start position:0%
um the I guess my question is just in
 
04:39:20.670 --> 04:39:20.680 align:start position:0%
looking at this chart um why is it that
 
04:39:24.070 --> 04:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
2025 is so much lower than the rest of
 
04:39:24.080 --> 04:39:25.709 align:start position:0%
2025 is so much lower than the rest of
the

04:39:25.709 --> 04:39:25.719 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:39:28.990 --> 04:39:29.000 align:start position:0%
range it's 5.5 million but above it is
 
04:39:32.230 --> 04:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
17 million below it's 15.8
 
04:39:34.869 --> 04:39:34.879 align:start position:0%
million sure so so the way that this
 
04:39:37.910 --> 04:39:37.920 align:start position:0%
this is phased in um for some of these
 
04:39:39.670 --> 04:39:39.680 align:start position:0%
numbers and again we take two separate
 
04:39:41.948 --> 04:39:41.958 align:start position:0%
approaches whether it's the estimates or
 
04:39:43.628 --> 04:39:43.638 align:start position:0%
whether it's the returns when you're
 
04:39:47.830 --> 04:39:47.840 align:start position:0%
hitting 2025 you're starting at that
 
04:39:51.150 --> 04:39:51.160 align:start position:0%
250 for tax year 2025 so it's similar to
 
04:39:51.160 --> 04:39:53.470 align:start position:0%
250 for tax year 2025 so it's similar to
the

04:39:53.470 --> 04:39:53.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:39:56.590 --> 04:39:56.600 align:start position:0%
2022 so if you see in 2022 the high is
 
04:40:00.030 --> 04:40:00.040 align:start position:0%
4.9 million the 2025 is the same it's
 
04:40:01.670 --> 04:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
the start of a new tax year so you're
 
04:40:03.390 --> 04:40:03.400 align:start position:0%
seeing just a little bit of those
 
04:40:07.230 --> 04:40:07.240 align:start position:0%
estimates being affective in 2025 I see
 
04:40:10.030 --> 04:40:10.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:14.910 --> 04:40:14.920 align:start position:0%
sense represent southw uh thank you um
 
04:40:16.670 --> 04:40:16.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my
 
04:40:19.350 --> 04:40:19.360 align:start position:0%
question do you see any downside to
 
04:40:23.150 --> 04:40:23.160 align:start position:0%
ending it at 100% based on the uh
 
04:40:26.788 --> 04:40:26.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:40:30.270 --> 04:40:30.280 align:start position:0%
at I I don't know if Dr has a downside I
 
04:40:31.990 --> 04:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
would say it depends on what your final
 
04:40:34.350 --> 04:40:34.360 align:start position:0%
goal is obviously reducing it to 100%
 
04:40:37.230 --> 04:40:37.240 align:start position:0%
doesn't bring the CCO outstanding
 
04:40:39.990 --> 04:40:40.000 align:start position:0%
liability number down as much as it does
 
04:40:41.948 --> 04:40:41.958 align:start position:0%
with 50% so
 
04:40:44.948 --> 04:40:44.958 align:start position:0%
50% uh you're cutting
 
04:40:49.510 --> 04:40:49.520 align:start position:0%
137 point or 137.5 million out but with
 
04:40:50.910 --> 04:40:50.920 align:start position:0%
this you're only reducing those
 
04:40:55.030 --> 04:40:55.040 align:start position:0%
outstanding CCO liabilities by 92.3
 
04:40:57.948 --> 04:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
million that does seem like that's a big
 
04:41:03.628 --> 04:41:03.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:03.638 --> 04:41:05.150 align:start position:0%
 
92

04:41:05.150 --> 04:41:05.160 align:start position:0%
92
 
04:41:07.550 --> 04:41:07.560 align:start position:0%
that that at least gets the process
 
04:41:07.560 --> 04:41:09.708 align:start position:0%
that that at least gets the process
going

04:41:09.708 --> 04:41:09.718 align:start position:0%
going
 
04:41:13.030 --> 04:41:13.040 align:start position:0%
and and once you better understand this
 
04:41:14.990 --> 04:41:15.000 align:start position:0%
and you can make
 
04:41:19.270 --> 04:41:19.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:41:22.990 --> 04:41:23.000 align:start position:0%
Bry uh yeah I was going to say something
 
04:41:25.150 --> 04:41:25.160 align:start position:0%
similar these are many years so the
 
04:41:29.150 --> 04:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
legislature can adjust these As Time
 
04:41:33.350 --> 04:41:33.360 align:start position:0%
Marches on uh and then obviously in 2030
 
04:41:36.628 --> 04:41:36.638 align:start position:0%
when this this round is done there could
 
04:41:40.230 --> 04:41:40.240 align:start position:0%
be another bill that would continue the
 
04:41:43.430 --> 04:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
reductions uh because right now we're at
 
04:41:47.868 --> 04:41:47.878 align:start position:0%
271 right is that correct 271 million is
 
04:41:51.550 --> 04:41:51.560 align:start position:0%
the number I think it's 279
 
04:41:55.390 --> 04:41:55.400 align:start position:0%
279 yeah oh 279 I'm sorry
 
04:41:58.150 --> 04:41:58.160 align:start position:0%
279 uh with this option we're only going
 
04:41:59.948 --> 04:41:59.958 align:start position:0%
to get it down by
 
04:42:02.150 --> 04:42:02.160 align:start position:0%
92 uh who knows what's going to happen
 
04:42:05.270 --> 04:42:05.280 align:start position:0%
with the taxpayers they may on their own
 
04:42:09.110 --> 04:42:09.120 align:start position:0%
start reducing this uh without without
 
04:42:10.750 --> 04:42:10.760 align:start position:0%
nudging from us
 
04:42:17.030 --> 04:42:17.040 align:start position:0%
so um I I I kind of I'm I'm on the I'll
 
04:42:19.430 --> 04:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
talk later let me talk later once once
 
04:42:21.750 --> 04:42:21.760 align:start position:0%
Melissa's done and uh you can put me
 
04:42:21.760 --> 04:42:24.350 align:start position:0%
Melissa's done and uh you can put me
after

04:42:24.350 --> 04:42:24.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:28.590 --> 04:42:28.600 align:start position:0%
Ames representative uh
 
04:42:32.510 --> 04:42:32.520 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you Mr chairman uh Melissa do
 
04:42:36.868 --> 04:42:36.878 align:start position:0%
we do you have an idea of whether doing
 
04:42:40.070 --> 04:42:40.080 align:start position:0%
this or even doing the other one would
 
04:42:43.910 --> 04:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
change the 60 million that you and and
 
04:42:45.868 --> 04:42:45.878 align:start position:0%
the com controller together have
 
04:42:49.510 --> 04:42:49.520 align:start position:0%
calculated would if the Auditors got
 
04:42:54.868 --> 04:42:54.878 align:start position:0%
their way be booked as uh as a liability
 
04:42:58.430 --> 04:42:58.440 align:start position:0%
in the Surplus statements in the
 
04:43:00.510 --> 04:43:00.520 align:start position:0%
caffer that's a great question
 
04:43:02.990 --> 04:43:03.000 align:start position:0%
representative Aly um I haven't looked
 
04:43:05.070 --> 04:43:05.080 align:start position:0%
at them hand inand
 
04:43:08.350 --> 04:43:08.360 align:start position:0%
my initial Instinct would be if you're
 
04:43:10.590 --> 04:43:10.600 align:start position:0%
dealing with a small smaller pool of
 
04:43:13.110 --> 04:43:13.120 align:start position:0%
people so once this is done white right
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
we've reduced it down essentially 93.
 
04:43:18.788 --> 04:43:18.798 align:start position:0%
million so then that scenario I think
 
04:43:21.270 --> 04:43:21.280 align:start position:0%
would look different however I'm not
 
04:43:21.280 --> 04:43:22.310 align:start position:0%
would look different however I'm not
sure

04:43:22.310 --> 04:43:22.320 align:start position:0%
sure
 
04:43:26.230 --> 04:43:26.240 align:start position:0%
how the com troller and KPMG and um the
 
04:43:28.070 --> 04:43:28.080 align:start position:0%
LBA would look at it at that point would
 
04:43:29.590 --> 04:43:29.600 align:start position:0%
they look at the outstanding liability
 
04:43:31.750 --> 04:43:31.760 align:start position:0%
or would they use the same methodology
 
04:43:33.070 --> 04:43:33.080 align:start position:0%
because I think if we use the same
 
04:43:34.948 --> 04:43:34.958 align:start position:0%
methodology it would reduce that that 60
 
04:43:39.390 --> 04:43:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:48.708 --> 04:43:48.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:48.718 --> 04:43:50.550 align:start position:0%
 
Ames

04:43:50.550 --> 04:43:50.560 align:start position:0%
Ames
 
04:43:50.560 --> 04:43:52.310 align:start position:0%
Ames
sorry

04:43:52.310 --> 04:43:52.320 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
04:43:57.070 --> 04:43:57.080 align:start position:0%
um I I guess my first question is
 
04:44:00.910 --> 04:44:00.920 align:start position:0%
what to make sure I understand this when
 
04:44:03.390 --> 04:44:03.400 align:start position:0%
you say estimate cumulative fiscal
 
04:44:03.400 --> 04:44:04.948 align:start position:0%
you say estimate cumulative fiscal
impact

04:44:04.948 --> 04:44:04.958 align:start position:0%
impact
 
04:44:06.470 --> 04:44:06.480 align:start position:0%
in the chart I'm looking at which is the
 
04:44:10.788 --> 04:44:10.798 align:start position:0%
most phased out fa long-term one um
 
04:44:14.510 --> 04:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
you've got $19 million as the high
 
04:44:17.510 --> 04:44:17.520 align:start position:0%
number for
 
04:44:22.590 --> 04:44:22.600 align:start position:0%
2023 I I guess that's cumulative um is
 
04:44:26.910 --> 04:44:26.920 align:start position:0%
that uh a revenue
 
04:44:26.920 --> 04:44:28.990 align:start position:0%
that uh a revenue
loss

04:44:28.990 --> 04:44:29.000 align:start position:0%
loss
 
04:44:32.070 --> 04:44:32.080 align:start position:0%
yes it
 
04:44:34.868 --> 04:44:34.878 align:start position:0%
is so um if
 
04:44:34.878 --> 04:44:36.390 align:start position:0%
is so um if
if

04:44:36.390 --> 04:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
if
 
04:44:39.750 --> 04:44:39.760 align:start position:0%
this committee were to recommend an
 
04:44:41.628 --> 04:44:41.638 align:start position:0%
amendment to House Bill
 
04:44:44.788 --> 04:44:44.798 align:start position:0%
two moving away from the
 
04:44:47.708 --> 04:44:47.718 align:start position:0%
50% proposal to this
 
04:44:49.320 --> 04:44:49.330 align:start position:0%
one the
 
04:44:49.330 --> 04:44:50.670 align:start position:0%
one the
[Music]

04:44:50.670 --> 04:44:50.680 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
04:44:54.030 --> 04:44:54.040 align:start position:0%
um the house bill
 
04:44:59.030 --> 04:44:59.040 align:start position:0%
two um would that that that language
 
04:45:02.430 --> 04:45:02.440 align:start position:0%
would carry with it the necessity of
 
04:45:07.270 --> 04:45:07.280 align:start position:0%
reducing um the um Revenue that the
 
04:45:10.628 --> 04:45:10.638 align:start position:0%
house bill to depends on by $19 million
 
04:45:12.910 --> 04:45:12.920 align:start position:0%
and that's less than the current
 
04:45:15.550 --> 04:45:15.560 align:start position:0%
language that's in there which is quite
 
04:45:17.788 --> 04:45:17.798 align:start position:0%
a lot more is that it do I have that
 
04:45:20.868 --> 04:45:20.878 align:start position:0%
right you do
 
04:45:24.830 --> 04:45:24.840 align:start position:0%
okay um and and I don't know whether um
 
04:45:26.750 --> 04:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
chair chairman
 
04:45:31.390 --> 04:45:31.400 align:start position:0%
major um I should go go deeper into that
 
04:45:35.150 --> 04:45:35.160 align:start position:0%
commission idea that I threw out
 
04:45:38.430 --> 04:45:38.440 align:start position:0%
um why don't we do that when we finish
 
04:45:40.110 --> 04:45:40.120 align:start position:0%
discussing these
 
04:45:44.350 --> 04:45:44.360 align:start position:0%
charts okay one thing on the latest
 
04:45:48.270 --> 04:45:48.280 align:start position:0%
scenario the 500 to
 
04:45:53.190 --> 04:45:53.200 align:start position:0%
100% is the biggest yearly
 
04:45:58.030 --> 04:45:58.040 align:start position:0%
impact for over the next four years is
 
04:46:00.708 --> 04:46:00.718 align:start position:0%
20124 is $17
 
04:46:02.948 --> 04:46:02.958 align:start position:0%
million in
 
04:46:06.830 --> 04:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
1526 and 19 and then
 
04:46:11.270 --> 04:46:11.280 align:start position:0%
it by that time I would imagine that
 
04:46:12.270 --> 04:46:12.280 align:start position:0%
with the
 
04:46:15.550 --> 04:46:15.560 align:start position:0%
experience they may make an adjustment
 
04:46:18.708 --> 04:46:18.718 align:start position:0%
so that it wouldn't get up to 28 and 34
 
04:46:23.830 --> 04:46:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:27.868 --> 04:46:27.878 align:start position:0%
impact the the U cumulative impact
 
04:46:30.350 --> 04:46:30.360 align:start position:0%
however um
 
04:46:33.190 --> 04:46:33.200 align:start position:0%
eventually would be
 
04:46:38.708 --> 04:46:38.718 align:start position:0%
92.3 million dollar as a net loss of
 
04:46:38.718 --> 04:46:41.230 align:start position:0%
92.3 million dollar as a net loss of
Revenue

04:46:41.230 --> 04:46:41.240 align:start position:0%
Revenue
 
04:46:43.830 --> 04:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
y representa
 
04:46:49.670 --> 04:46:49.680 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you as I understand this on
 
04:46:53.788 --> 04:46:53.798 align:start position:0%
the the maximum in each case is the
 
04:46:57.310 --> 04:46:57.320 align:start position:0%
maximum that they think it might be in a
 
04:47:00.470 --> 04:47:00.480 align:start position:0%
given year but if we look at the
 
04:47:03.270 --> 04:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
cumulative impact the maximum they think
 
04:47:05.868 --> 04:47:05.878 align:start position:0%
it might be in this
 
04:47:10.788 --> 04:47:10.798 align:start position:0%
bium bu the next budget would be 20 um
 
04:47:12.990 --> 04:47:13.000 align:start position:0%
would be
 
04:47:16.110 --> 04:47:16.120 align:start position:0%
25 25 24
 
04:47:16.120 --> 04:47:18.350 align:start position:0%
25 25 24
million

04:47:18.350 --> 04:47:18.360 align:start position:0%
million
 
04:47:24.310 --> 04:47:24.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:47:27.070 --> 04:47:27.080 align:start position:0%
800,000 but I was thinking of taking
 
04:47:32.150 --> 04:47:32.160 align:start position:0%
maybe 15 million for that the next the
 
04:47:37.708 --> 04:47:37.718 align:start position:0%
20 24 if we if the whole maximum came in
 
04:47:40.708 --> 04:47:40.718 align:start position:0%
there would be less money I mean was had
 
04:47:47.230 --> 04:47:47.240 align:start position:0%
to be sent back on the next uh year 24
 
04:47:50.788 --> 04:47:50.798 align:start position:0%
there'd be a lot less money to pass send
 
04:47:52.868 --> 04:47:52.878 align:start position:0%
over because they wouldn't have started
 
04:47:52.878 --> 04:47:53.788 align:start position:0%
over because they wouldn't have started
the

04:47:53.788 --> 04:47:53.798 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:57.470 --> 04:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
250 um tax liability
 
04:47:59.750 --> 04:47:59.760 align:start position:0%
yet that's the way I'm reading this
 
04:48:02.390 --> 04:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
unless they can anticipate it which they
 
04:48:05.190 --> 04:48:05.200 align:start position:0%
may be able to do
 
04:48:07.628 --> 04:48:07.638 align:start position:0%
um but by
 
04:48:10.868 --> 04:48:10.878 align:start position:0%
2425 um we'll have at least some idea of
 
04:48:13.910 --> 04:48:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:17.868 --> 04:48:17.878 align:start position:0%
2223 and be able to adapt again
 
04:48:22.830 --> 04:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:28.030 --> 04:48:28.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:48:28.040 --> 04:48:29.788 align:start position:0%
 
charts

04:48:29.788 --> 04:48:29.798 align:start position:0%
charts
 
04:48:34.750 --> 04:48:34.760 align:start position:0%
questions I guess I'm back back again
 
04:48:38.350 --> 04:48:38.360 align:start position:0%
repres Ames yeah so I I do want to say
 
04:48:40.708 --> 04:48:40.718 align:start position:0%
that um
 
04:48:40.718 --> 04:48:42.708 align:start position:0%
that um
that

04:48:42.708 --> 04:48:42.718 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:48:45.150 --> 04:48:45.160 align:start position:0%
um I've learned a lot I think we've all
 
04:48:47.270 --> 04:48:47.280 align:start position:0%
learned a lot about credit carryovers in
 
04:48:50.788 --> 04:48:50.798 align:start position:0%
the last couple of days um and we
 
04:48:54.310 --> 04:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
received um a lot of information from
 
04:48:56.390 --> 04:48:56.400 align:start position:0%
the com troller I believe it was com
 
04:48:59.830 --> 04:48:59.840 align:start position:0%
troller who sent us the audit reports
 
04:49:00.830 --> 04:49:00.840 align:start position:0%
and the
 
04:49:03.270 --> 04:49:03.280 align:start position:0%
discussion um between the auditor and
 
04:49:08.350 --> 04:49:08.360 align:start position:0%
the Dr and Das and um maybe a few other
 
04:49:09.948 --> 04:49:09.958 align:start position:0%
entities in fact there was a
 
04:49:11.628 --> 04:49:11.638 align:start position:0%
presentation I was interested to see
 
04:49:13.590 --> 04:49:13.600 align:start position:0%
that had happened to the to the Senate
 
04:49:16.868 --> 04:49:16.878 align:start position:0%
Ways and Means Committee um but uh not
 
04:49:22.830 --> 04:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
to us um so that's by the by um it's a
 
04:49:25.430 --> 04:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
complicated matter um we're talking
 
04:49:28.270 --> 04:49:28.280 align:start position:0%
about a a big change here we're talking
 
04:49:31.150 --> 04:49:31.160 align:start position:0%
about an impact on the budget that's now
 
04:49:31.160 --> 04:49:32.350 align:start position:0%
about an impact on the budget that's now
under

04:49:32.350 --> 04:49:32.360 align:start position:0%
under
 
04:49:35.470 --> 04:49:35.480 align:start position:0%
consideration um there's nothing in what
 
04:49:37.948 --> 04:49:37.958 align:start position:0%
I've read that suggests to me that this
 
04:49:40.990 --> 04:49:41.000 align:start position:0%
is an emergency the Auditors have raised
 
04:49:44.070 --> 04:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
a question the uh agencies have
 
04:49:47.110 --> 04:49:47.120 align:start position:0%
responded appropriately discussing the
 
04:49:49.948 --> 04:49:49.958 align:start position:0%
question trying trying to understand it
 
04:49:54.430 --> 04:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
better sorting out uh what is churn um
 
04:49:59.270 --> 04:49:59.280 align:start position:0%
just the the natural ins and outs of of
 
04:50:02.830 --> 04:50:02.840 align:start position:0%
Revenue um and what might be of Greater
 
04:50:05.910 --> 04:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
concern um sort of a a
 
04:50:10.868 --> 04:50:10.878 align:start position:0%
growing uh amount of uh of uh liability
 
04:50:15.628 --> 04:50:15.638 align:start position:0%
that could crash on us um so um that I'm
 
04:50:21.230 --> 04:50:21.240 align:start position:0%
seeing a a reasoned uh consideration of
 
04:50:24.868 --> 04:50:24.878 align:start position:0%
a complicated issue and it seems to me
 
04:50:28.750 --> 04:50:28.760 align:start position:0%
the that we've had little time
 
04:50:32.150 --> 04:50:32.160 align:start position:0%
to uh understand that fully I'm sure
 
04:50:34.548 --> 04:50:34.558 align:start position:0%
that I don't fully understand it in
 
04:50:36.470 --> 04:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
these two or three days that we've been
 
04:50:41.430 --> 04:50:41.440 align:start position:0%
looking at it um and um that it
 
04:50:45.948 --> 04:50:45.958 align:start position:0%
deserves a close look I would expect the
 
04:50:49.270 --> 04:50:49.280 align:start position:0%
Auditors um independent uh rating
 
04:50:52.150 --> 04:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
agencies if that's an issue here um
 
04:50:54.788 --> 04:50:54.798 align:start position:0%
would be very respectful of a process
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
that took as the next step the
 
04:50:59.948 --> 04:50:59.958 align:start position:0%
establishment of a highlevel commission
 
04:51:02.350 --> 04:51:02.360 align:start position:0%
to um
 
04:51:05.070 --> 04:51:05.080 align:start position:0%
address uh this issue in a way that
 
04:51:07.390 --> 04:51:07.400 align:start position:0%
would be defined in that legislation in
 
04:51:10.788 --> 04:51:10.798 align:start position:0%
short order um reporting back and making
 
04:51:13.430 --> 04:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
recommendations for whatever legislation
 
04:51:17.670 --> 04:51:17.680 align:start position:0%
may be needed next uh fall it could be
 
04:51:20.830 --> 04:51:20.840 align:start position:0%
that quick I don't see why not I I say
 
04:51:23.110 --> 04:51:23.120 align:start position:0%
Commission because probably the best way
 
04:51:26.670 --> 04:51:26.680 align:start position:0%
to do this would be to include the U com
 
04:51:28.750 --> 04:51:28.760 align:start position:0%
controller and the
 
04:51:33.868 --> 04:51:33.878 align:start position:0%
treasurer um and Dr um or designes I
 
04:51:37.270 --> 04:51:37.280 align:start position:0%
don't know sort that out and uh who from
 
04:51:40.750 --> 04:51:40.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature would sort that out but
 
04:51:44.150 --> 04:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
um but they would dive into this they
 
04:51:46.670 --> 04:51:46.680 align:start position:0%
would hold public hearings businesses
 
04:51:48.230 --> 04:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
that are going to be affected by this
 
04:51:50.910 --> 04:51:50.920 align:start position:0%
would have a chance to speak to it uh
 
04:51:53.590 --> 04:51:53.600 align:start position:0%
how do how do they feel about making
 
04:51:56.430 --> 04:51:56.440 align:start position:0%
this change and uh how do they see the
 
04:51:59.948 --> 04:51:59.958 align:start position:0%
risks and consequences I'd like to sort
 
04:52:04.190 --> 04:52:04.200 align:start position:0%
of put this out and um have it
 
04:52:06.910 --> 04:52:06.920 align:start position:0%
fully considered through a public review
 
04:52:09.990 --> 04:52:10.000 align:start position:0%
process before we jump into something
 
04:52:15.190 --> 04:52:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:18.868 --> 04:52:18.878 align:start position:0%
thinking thank you representative Ames
 
04:52:21.150 --> 04:52:21.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative
 
04:52:24.030 --> 04:52:24.040 align:start position:0%
abon thank you Mr chair um I have
 
04:52:24.040 --> 04:52:25.390 align:start position:0%
abon thank you Mr chair um I have
similar

04:52:25.390 --> 04:52:25.400 align:start position:0%
similar
 
04:52:28.390 --> 04:52:28.400 align:start position:0%
comments uh what did we learned
 
04:52:30.430 --> 04:52:30.440 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh we learned that these
 
04:52:32.708 --> 04:52:32.718 align:start position:0%
indeed are revenues that we're talking
 
04:52:34.830 --> 04:52:34.840 align:start position:0%
about that will impact the budget we
 
04:52:36.750 --> 04:52:36.760 align:start position:0%
weren't clear on that before
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
yesterday uh we recognized that that we
 
04:52:42.230 --> 04:52:42.240 align:start position:0%
had learned that that
 
04:52:44.070 --> 04:52:44.080 align:start position:0%
KPMG uh the
 
04:52:48.150 --> 04:52:48.160 align:start position:0%
Auditors um recognize this as an issue
 
04:52:50.230 --> 04:52:50.240 align:start position:0%
but because of this our controllers
 
04:52:53.470 --> 04:52:53.480 align:start position:0%
ability to argue that that the liability
 
04:52:55.910 --> 04:52:55.920 align:start position:0%
would really be no more than 60 million
 
04:53:00.110 --> 04:53:00.120 align:start position:0%
in a year or by anym I'm not sure uh
 
04:53:03.030 --> 04:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
that they deemed they KPMG deemed the
 
04:53:03.040 --> 04:53:05.190 align:start position:0%
that they deemed they KPMG deemed the
risk

04:53:05.190 --> 04:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
risk
 
04:53:07.948 --> 04:53:07.958 align:start position:0%
immaterial although made note of it in
 
04:53:10.230 --> 04:53:10.240 align:start position:0%
their audit
 
04:53:10.240 --> 04:53:12.110 align:start position:0%
their audit
report

04:53:12.110 --> 04:53:12.120 align:start position:0%
report
 
04:53:15.590 --> 04:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
uh uh we're still not clear uh we we
 
04:53:17.990 --> 04:53:18.000 align:start position:0%
talked to the Dr about Dr about this
 
04:53:20.470 --> 04:53:20.480 align:start position:0%
yesterday as to whether how other states
 
04:53:23.150 --> 04:53:23.160 align:start position:0%
handle this and as of
 
04:53:25.390 --> 04:53:25.400 align:start position:0%
yesterday we still don't know how other
 
04:53:27.070 --> 04:53:27.080 align:start position:0%
states handle
 
04:53:30.910 --> 04:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
this um and the other point is that the
 
04:53:35.350 --> 04:53:35.360 align:start position:0%
increase in this uh carry forward seems
 
04:53:40.670 --> 04:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
to be plateauing at around the 279 Mark
 
04:53:43.708 --> 04:53:43.718 align:start position:0%
I think the last increase was was not
 
04:53:43.718 --> 04:53:44.548 align:start position:0%
I think the last increase was was not
that

04:53:44.548 --> 04:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:53:48.070 --> 04:53:48.080 align:start position:0%
great I conclude we need to fix the
 
04:53:51.070 --> 04:53:51.080 align:start position:0%
problem that the representative
 
04:53:53.948 --> 04:53:53.958 align:start position:0%
major representative Aly have talked
 
04:53:56.590 --> 04:53:56.600 align:start position:0%
about for many years uh this brings it
 
04:54:00.548 --> 04:54:00.558 align:start position:0%
to a head uh now if I had to pick a
 
04:54:03.910 --> 04:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
solution I would pick this the last
 
04:54:07.150 --> 04:54:07.160 align:start position:0%
solution because it minimizes the impact
 
04:54:09.868 --> 04:54:09.878 align:start position:0%
on in in the coming
 
04:54:12.350 --> 04:54:12.360 align:start position:0%
years but
 
04:54:16.990 --> 04:54:17.000 align:start position:0%
yesterday I did propose that perhaps we
 
04:54:20.230 --> 04:54:20.240 align:start position:0%
put a Slowdown on this and why do we
 
04:54:23.750 --> 04:54:23.760 align:start position:0%
even need this in in house bill to uh
 
04:54:26.110 --> 04:54:26.120 align:start position:0%
similar to what representative Ames is
 
04:54:28.830 --> 04:54:28.840 align:start position:0%
saying uh and that we should my
 
04:54:32.628 --> 04:54:32.638 align:start position:0%
recommendation was that we we just have
 
04:54:34.230 --> 04:54:34.240 align:start position:0%
a a study
 
04:54:37.270 --> 04:54:37.280 align:start position:0%
of way house Ways and Means uh give us
 
04:54:39.948 --> 04:54:39.958 align:start position:0%
more time to prepare a bill for next
 
04:54:43.590 --> 04:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
year but I certainly am not
 
04:54:47.230 --> 04:54:47.240 align:start position:0%
opposed to so I don't
 
04:54:50.230 --> 04:54:50.240 align:start position:0%
think I agree with representative Ames
 
04:54:52.868 --> 04:54:52.878 align:start position:0%
there's no rush here we've been living
 
04:54:56.868 --> 04:54:56.878 align:start position:0%
with this issue for a long time and uh I
 
04:55:00.030 --> 04:55:00.040 align:start position:0%
think once the the the Auditors see that
 
04:55:03.230 --> 04:55:03.240 align:start position:0%
we have a plan some kind of a plan that
 
04:55:05.070 --> 04:55:05.080 align:start position:0%
they that that would help uh the
 
04:55:07.750 --> 04:55:07.760 align:start position:0%
controller out uh with the with the
 
04:55:11.590 --> 04:55:11.600 align:start position:0%
audits in this in this regard so I I
 
04:55:15.628 --> 04:55:15.638 align:start position:0%
would uh and I like the idea of a of a
 
04:55:18.150 --> 04:55:18.160 align:start position:0%
commission with certain players at at
 
04:55:21.750 --> 04:55:21.760 align:start position:0%
the table uh Beyond uh the house and and
 
04:55:26.110 --> 04:55:26.120 align:start position:0%
uh and Senate members so I I I would I
 
04:55:27.470 --> 04:55:27.480 align:start position:0%
would kind of uh agree with
 
04:55:28.910 --> 04:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
representative Ames I would I would
 
04:55:34.110 --> 04:55:34.120 align:start position:0%
support his his uh his idea thank you
 
04:55:34.120 --> 04:55:35.708 align:start position:0%
support his his uh his idea thank you
representative

04:55:35.708 --> 04:55:35.718 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:55:39.310 --> 04:55:39.320 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you Mr chairman
 
04:55:42.990 --> 04:55:43.000 align:start position:0%
um we I think the reason that we ought
 
04:55:46.948 --> 04:55:46.958 align:start position:0%
to put something into the budget is that
 
04:55:49.708 --> 04:55:49.718 align:start position:0%
on especially with the commission tied
 
04:55:52.708 --> 04:55:52.718 align:start position:0%
to it so it can be modified afterwards
 
04:55:58.270 --> 04:55:58.280 align:start position:0%
but on that we do not know what the risk
 
04:56:01.310 --> 04:56:01.320 align:start position:0%
really is to the state for this to start
 
04:56:03.868 --> 04:56:03.878 align:start position:0%
with that's the first thing uh last
 
04:56:08.350 --> 04:56:08.360 align:start position:0%
night I got from the Dr uh they managed
 
04:56:12.470 --> 04:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
to find Credit carry forward information
 
04:56:15.948 --> 04:56:15.958 align:start position:0%
for 2000 FY
 
04:56:18.948 --> 04:56:18.958 align:start position:0%
2009 uh through
 
04:56:24.510 --> 04:56:24.520 align:start position:0%
13 on which showed that there was
 
04:56:28.990 --> 04:56:29.000 align:start position:0%
really very the only slowdown in the
 
04:56:31.910 --> 04:56:31.920 align:start position:0%
increase of the credit carry forward
 
04:56:36.070 --> 04:56:36.080 align:start position:0%
amount that we had have was actually in
 
04:56:39.230 --> 04:56:39.240 align:start position:0%
13 they had no idea why I have no idea
 
04:56:42.270 --> 04:56:42.280 align:start position:0%
why and uh both of us are uncertain
 
04:56:46.310 --> 04:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
about whether that information would be
 
04:56:48.270 --> 04:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
considered accurate today because in
 
04:56:50.948 --> 04:56:50.958 align:start position:0%
those days we didn't have computers
 
04:56:55.070 --> 04:56:55.080 align:start position:0%
working uh very well on and they didn't
 
04:56:58.548 --> 04:56:58.558 align:start position:0%
have budget numbers working very well uh
 
04:57:00.470 --> 04:57:00.480 align:start position:0%
the place was not very
 
04:57:05.350 --> 04:57:05.360 align:start position:0%
computerized um but on would but that
 
04:57:07.788 --> 04:57:07.798 align:start position:0%
would if we went through the greatest
 
04:57:11.190 --> 04:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
recession in 20
 
04:57:15.430 --> 04:57:15.440 align:start position:0%
years since 20 years before with no
 
04:57:19.230 --> 04:57:19.240 align:start position:0%
reduction during the recession in the
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward that was built up
 
04:57:26.948 --> 04:57:26.958 align:start position:0%
on we really have no idea why people are
 
04:57:29.670 --> 04:57:29.680 align:start position:0%
leaving this money in here and that
 
04:57:32.910 --> 04:57:32.920 align:start position:0%
still makes me incredibly nervous about
 
04:57:36.310 --> 04:57:36.320 align:start position:0%
when they might take it out on
 
04:57:38.548 --> 04:57:38.558 align:start position:0%
especially these guys with
 
04:57:38.558 --> 04:57:40.788 align:start position:0%
especially these guys with
500%

04:57:40.788 --> 04:57:40.798 align:start position:0%
500%
 
04:57:44.948 --> 04:57:44.958 align:start position:0%
250% of of a Year's of their tax
 
04:57:50.430 --> 04:57:50.440 align:start position:0%
liability for one year um so it is
 
04:57:53.190 --> 04:57:53.200 align:start position:0%
extremely difficult to get Finance
 
04:57:55.750 --> 04:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
committees to agree to put something
 
04:57:58.548 --> 04:57:58.558 align:start position:0%
like this in and
 
04:57:58.558 --> 04:58:00.788 align:start position:0%
like this in and
take

04:58:00.788 --> 04:58:00.798 align:start position:0%
take
 
04:58:05.190 --> 04:58:05.200 align:start position:0%
uh take uh some reductions in Revenue in
 
04:58:11.310 --> 04:58:11.320 align:start position:0%
order to be able to to uh lower risk in
 
04:58:14.910 --> 04:58:14.920 align:start position:0%
future years because they're focused on
 
04:58:17.270 --> 04:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
the best that they can possibly do for
 
04:58:20.030 --> 04:58:20.040 align:start position:0%
the two-year period at the point when
 
04:58:23.868 --> 04:58:23.878 align:start position:0%
the budget is being done and if it can
 
04:58:26.750 --> 04:58:26.760 align:start position:0%
be put in this year at a rate that is
 
04:58:30.590 --> 04:58:30.600 align:start position:0%
not going to impact more than I would
 
04:58:33.470 --> 04:58:33.480 align:start position:0%
say 15 million and I'm sorry I shouldn't
 
04:58:37.030 --> 04:58:37.040 align:start position:0%
have added the five into the 19 uh it's
 
04:58:40.670 --> 04:58:40.680 align:start position:0%
19 million possible maximum that could
 
04:58:42.948 --> 04:58:42.958 align:start position:0%
come out by the end of
 
04:58:42.958 --> 04:58:44.470 align:start position:0%
come out by the end of
23

04:58:44.470 --> 04:58:44.480 align:start position:0%
23
 
04:58:50.310 --> 04:58:50.320 align:start position:0%
uh and but put in 15 million for that
 
04:58:54.070 --> 04:58:54.080 align:start position:0%
and put in a commission to look at
 
04:58:57.628 --> 04:58:57.638 align:start position:0%
what's happening in a much deeper way so
 
04:59:03.190 --> 04:59:03.200 align:start position:0%
that it can then modify what is done now
 
04:59:05.910 --> 04:59:05.920 align:start position:0%
rather than have to convince them yet
 
04:59:08.868 --> 04:59:08.878 align:start position:0%
again to face this
 
04:59:12.350 --> 04:59:12.360 align:start position:0%
issue and I think that it's it's worth
 
04:59:19.310 --> 04:59:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:22.470 --> 04:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
you let me say something
 
04:59:26.510 --> 04:59:26.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:29.350 --> 04:59:29.360 align:start position:0%
this probably longer than anybody else
 
04:59:33.070 --> 04:59:33.080 align:start position:0%
has except representing ony and I
 
04:59:34.990 --> 04:59:35.000 align:start position:0%
constantly ask the
 
04:59:35.000 --> 04:59:37.548 align:start position:0%
constantly ask the
V

04:59:37.548 --> 04:59:37.558 align:start position:0%
V
 
04:59:41.910 --> 04:59:41.920 align:start position:0%
why and what are we doing about
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
it as and over the years nothing's been
 
04:59:49.030 --> 04:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
done it keeps growing now it's growing
 
04:59:51.510 --> 04:59:51.520 align:start position:0%
to over a quarter of a billion
 
04:59:55.070 --> 04:59:55.080 align:start position:0%
dollars and what we're at risk here is
 
04:59:56.910 --> 04:59:56.920 align:start position:0%
that all of a
 
05:00:01.150 --> 05:00:01.160 align:start position:0%
sudden for some unknown reason somebody
 
05:00:04.350 --> 05:00:04.360 align:start position:0%
they might want to take out a 100 milon
 
05:00:07.750 --> 05:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
$100 million we already plan to spend so
 
05:00:11.430 --> 05:00:11.440 align:start position:0%
much because we do our budgeting on cash
 
05:00:14.430 --> 05:00:14.440 align:start position:0%
so that's that's a dangerous liability
 
05:00:16.390 --> 05:00:16.400 align:start position:0%
that's that's out
 
05:00:23.110 --> 05:00:23.120 align:start position:0%
there I I like representative Ames
 
05:00:26.070 --> 05:00:26.080 align:start position:0%
suggestion that we form a
 
05:00:30.310 --> 05:00:30.320 align:start position:0%
commission study it and that I also like
 
05:00:34.548 --> 05:00:34.558 align:start position:0%
representative aly's suggestion that we
 
05:00:38.390 --> 05:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
shouldn't keep pushing this down the
 
05:00:41.990 --> 05:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
road uh we should start addressing
 
05:00:45.910 --> 05:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
it and this last scenario that the Dr
 
05:00:50.910 --> 05:00:50.920 align:start position:0%
came up with shows that if we start the
 
05:00:54.830 --> 05:00:54.840 align:start position:0%
process the first year in
 
05:00:59.628 --> 05:00:59.638 align:start position:0%
2022 the biggest impact is $5
 
05:01:01.830 --> 05:01:01.840 align:start position:0%
million in
 
05:01:06.230 --> 05:01:06.240 align:start position:0%
2023 largest impact is $14
 
05:01:10.230 --> 05:01:10.240 align:start position:0%
million and cumulative up to up to 20
 
05:01:11.948 --> 05:01:11.958 align:start position:0%
but it probably probably wouldn't be
 
05:01:14.670 --> 05:01:14.680 align:start position:0%
that but at least the process started
 
05:01:17.510 --> 05:01:17.520 align:start position:0%
and we have a commission the commission
 
05:01:19.270 --> 05:01:19.280 align:start position:0%
by the end of
 
05:01:19.280 --> 05:01:21.270 align:start position:0%
by the end of
22

05:01:21.270 --> 05:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
22
 
05:01:24.708 --> 05:01:24.718 align:start position:0%
should understand it enough to be able
 
05:01:28.070 --> 05:01:28.080 align:start position:0%
to put a system in place that'll correct
 
05:01:32.948 --> 05:01:32.958 align:start position:0%
it for the people that have their money
 
05:01:37.510 --> 05:01:37.520 align:start position:0%
us it also protect the state so what I'd
 
05:01:40.548 --> 05:01:40.558 align:start position:0%
like to see is a combination of
 
05:01:45.230 --> 05:01:45.240 align:start position:0%
both is something similar to this last
 
05:01:48.708 --> 05:01:48.718 align:start position:0%
scenario along with a
 
05:01:51.070 --> 05:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
commission and I hope that's this is
 
05:01:52.510 --> 05:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
what comes out of
 
05:01:57.150 --> 05:01:57.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:59.350 --> 05:01:59.360 align:start position:0%
Union thank you Mr chairman I just
 
05:02:00.868 --> 05:02:00.878 align:start position:0%
wanted to say that I agree with the
 
05:02:03.190 --> 05:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
comments you just made um I think
 
05:02:05.470 --> 05:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
kicking the can down the road on this
 
05:02:07.910 --> 05:02:07.920 align:start position:0%
would not be a good idea we can still do
 
05:02:09.270 --> 05:02:09.280 align:start position:0%
both these things we can have a
 
05:02:12.270 --> 05:02:12.280 align:start position:0%
commission and we can start the process
 
05:02:14.830 --> 05:02:14.840 align:start position:0%
because if the trend continues and the
 
05:02:17.548 --> 05:02:17.558 align:start position:0%
trend has been larger and larger if we
 
05:02:20.830 --> 05:02:20.840 align:start position:0%
wait another year that number May well
 
05:02:23.350 --> 05:02:23.360 align:start position:0%
be even larger so I think to start the
 
05:02:26.070 --> 05:02:26.080 align:start position:0%
process totally makes sense um when the
 
05:02:28.230 --> 05:02:28.240 align:start position:0%
commission comes back with its
 
05:02:31.230 --> 05:02:31.240 align:start position:0%
conclusions um next year we can easily
 
05:02:32.990 --> 05:02:33.000 align:start position:0%
we well maybe not easily but we can
 
05:02:35.750 --> 05:02:35.760 align:start position:0%
alter this path but I agree I like this
 
05:02:38.030 --> 05:02:38.040 align:start position:0%
last solution the best and I think we do
 
05:02:39.990 --> 05:02:40.000 align:start position:0%
need to start
 
05:02:42.130 --> 05:02:42.140 align:start position:0%
on represent spillsbury
 
05:02:42.140 --> 05:02:50.190 align:start position:0%
on represent spillsbury
[Music]

05:02:50.190 --> 05:02:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:52.670 --> 05:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
you need to unmute representative
 
05:02:52.680 --> 05:02:54.670 align:start position:0%
you need to unmute representative
spillsbury

05:02:54.670 --> 05:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
spillsbury
 
05:02:57.948 --> 05:02:57.958 align:start position:0%
thank you uh with with the shared screen
 
05:03:00.948 --> 05:03:00.958 align:start position:0%
I can't see a lot um I'm
 
05:03:04.628 --> 05:03:04.638 align:start position:0%
sorry my quick question is am I correct
 
05:03:06.510 --> 05:03:06.520 align:start position:0%
in understanding that if this does not
 
05:03:10.270 --> 05:03:10.280 align:start position:0%
go into hb2 this year it would be a
 
05:03:12.868 --> 05:03:12.878 align:start position:0%
two-year lag till the next legislature
 
05:03:16.070 --> 05:03:16.080 align:start position:0%
before it could be addressed again if it
 
05:03:17.990 --> 05:03:18.000 align:start position:0%
if it doesn't go into this
 
05:03:21.430 --> 05:03:21.440 align:start position:0%
year uh no because it's not a it's not a
 
05:03:25.390 --> 05:03:25.400 align:start position:0%
bill that has been ited if a bill that's
 
05:03:28.310 --> 05:03:28.320 align:start position:0%
been itl the first year cannot appear
 
05:03:31.390 --> 05:03:31.400 align:start position:0%
the second year but if we go in with
 
05:03:35.310 --> 05:03:35.320 align:start position:0%
just a commission the commission uh
 
05:03:37.510 --> 05:03:37.520 align:start position:0%
would work at this and by the time that
 
05:03:40.030 --> 05:03:40.040 align:start position:0%
they develop the
 
05:03:40.040 --> 05:03:41.948 align:start position:0%
they develop the
solution

05:03:41.948 --> 05:03:41.958 align:start position:0%
solution
 
05:03:44.590 --> 05:03:44.600 align:start position:0%
uh they might be able to have a bill
 
05:03:46.750 --> 05:03:46.760 align:start position:0%
next year they might be the following
 
05:03:49.830 --> 05:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
year so I'm I'm confused about something
 
05:03:52.150 --> 05:03:52.160 align:start position:0%
because it affects Revenue I thought it
 
05:03:57.430 --> 05:03:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:00.670 --> 05:04:00.680 align:start position:0%
year not to my
 
05:04:03.948 --> 05:04:03.958 align:start position:0%
knowledge okay hey Mr
 
05:04:06.708 --> 05:04:06.718 align:start position:0%
chairman yeah
 
05:04:09.628 --> 05:04:09.638 align:start position:0%
represent thank you I think the problem
 
05:04:13.030 --> 05:04:13.040 align:start position:0%
is on once the budget is in place if
 
05:04:15.750 --> 05:04:15.760 align:start position:0%
there's no extra money lying around at
 
05:04:17.910 --> 05:04:17.920 align:start position:0%
the time we came back with something
 
05:04:20.788 --> 05:04:20.798 align:start position:0%
that would cost money in a substantial
 
05:04:24.548 --> 05:04:24.558 align:start position:0%
way which this does uh that the it would
 
05:04:26.070 --> 05:04:26.080 align:start position:0%
go to the finance committee and they'd
 
05:04:26.080 --> 05:04:28.390 align:start position:0%
go to the finance committee and they'd
kill

05:04:28.390 --> 05:04:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:32.708 --> 05:04:32.718 align:start position:0%
it that's essentially my point uh so
 
05:04:32.718 --> 05:04:33.470 align:start position:0%
it that's essentially my point uh so
just

05:04:33.470 --> 05:04:33.480 align:start position:0%
just
 
05:04:38.070 --> 05:04:38.080 align:start position:0%
to go quickly my I I think we should do
 
05:04:40.270 --> 05:04:40.280 align:start position:0%
something and initiate something I'm
 
05:04:42.390 --> 05:04:42.400 align:start position:0%
perfectly comfortable with phasing it in
 
05:04:45.150 --> 05:04:45.160 align:start position:0%
one of these formats and I'm perfectly
 
05:04:46.430 --> 05:04:46.440 align:start position:0%
comfortable with having a study
 
05:04:47.990 --> 05:04:48.000 align:start position:0%
commission that can then revise the
 
05:04:51.230 --> 05:04:51.240 align:start position:0%
thinking but let's at least kick it
 
05:04:54.350 --> 05:04:54.360 align:start position:0%
off uh representative
 
05:04:58.590 --> 05:04:58.600 align:start position:0%
Brony yes thank you Mr chair U I think
 
05:05:01.430 --> 05:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
I'll ask representative Amy you thinking
 
05:05:03.310 --> 05:05:03.320 align:start position:0%
of this last
 
05:05:06.830 --> 05:05:06.840 align:start position:0%
scenario uh that that that could always
 
05:05:08.708 --> 05:05:08.718 align:start position:0%
be adjusted down the road after the
 
05:05:12.670 --> 05:05:12.680 align:start position:0%
commission Works uh so that the Maximum
 
05:05:16.628 --> 05:05:16.638 align:start position:0%
Impact would be 20 and 225 million and
 
05:05:19.030 --> 05:05:19.040 align:start position:0%
call it 14 million and
 
05:05:23.310 --> 05:05:23.320 align:start position:0%
23 I could support that plus the
 
05:05:26.230 --> 05:05:26.240 align:start position:0%
commission representative Murphy hey
 
05:05:30.150 --> 05:05:30.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:37.788 --> 05:05:37.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:40.470 --> 05:05:40.480 align:start position:0%
Mercy I just wanted to I'm sorry I was
 
05:05:43.430 --> 05:05:43.440 align:start position:0%
down I just did uh can you hear me now
 
05:05:45.708 --> 05:05:45.718 align:start position:0%
I'm in my car we can hear
 
05:05:45.718 --> 05:05:50.110 align:start position:0%
I'm in my car we can hear
you

05:05:50.110 --> 05:05:50.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:53.390 --> 05:05:53.400 align:start position:0%
sorry I I I just apologize for being
 
05:05:54.910 --> 05:05:54.920 align:start position:0%
away we had an explosion outside the
 
05:05:56.670 --> 05:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
window so but I'm
 
05:05:59.470 --> 05:05:59.480 align:start position:0%
back okay well thank welcome
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
aboard thank
 
05:06:04.910 --> 05:06:04.920 align:start position:0%
you uh representative
 
05:06:09.150 --> 05:06:09.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:13.788 --> 05:06:13.798 align:start position:0%
you making sure I'm unmuted yeah um so
 
05:06:17.070 --> 05:06:17.080 align:start position:0%
thank you and I I think uh what's been
 
05:06:21.470 --> 05:06:21.480 align:start position:0%
suggested this uh combination of uh
 
05:06:23.948 --> 05:06:23.958 align:start position:0%
doing something concrete and setting up
 
05:06:29.590 --> 05:06:29.600 align:start position:0%
the commission makes sense um and
 
05:06:31.990 --> 05:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
um we'd have to work on the phrasing
 
05:06:33.110 --> 05:06:33.120 align:start position:0%
this would be
 
05:06:35.430 --> 05:06:35.440 align:start position:0%
this would be a recommendation to the
 
05:06:39.310 --> 05:06:39.320 align:start position:0%
finance committee for an amendment to
 
05:06:41.948 --> 05:06:41.958 align:start position:0%
hp2 as I understand it right they've
 
05:06:45.830 --> 05:06:45.840 align:start position:0%
asked us to look at it and then uh
 
05:06:48.350 --> 05:06:48.360 align:start position:0%
provide an amendment if we felt
 
05:06:50.990 --> 05:06:51.000 align:start position:0%
necessary so we'll have to work that out
 
05:06:54.390 --> 05:06:54.400 align:start position:0%
but uh I think the timing
 
05:06:57.910 --> 05:06:57.920 align:start position:0%
uh um fits pretty well if we can get
 
05:07:00.390 --> 05:07:00.400 align:start position:0%
this commission commission going right
 
05:07:02.830 --> 05:07:02.840 align:start position:0%
away which we if it does become a part
 
05:07:05.990 --> 05:07:06.000 align:start position:0%
of hp2 then uh it will get going you
 
05:07:08.350 --> 05:07:08.360 align:start position:0%
know it will be enacted in a timely
 
05:07:11.190 --> 05:07:11.200 align:start position:0%
fashion and we can get going on it and U
 
05:07:14.150 --> 05:07:14.160 align:start position:0%
then if it can get its work done in time
 
05:07:16.910 --> 05:07:16.920 align:start position:0%
for input into the next
 
05:07:19.708 --> 05:07:19.718 align:start position:0%
budget um then if there need to be
 
05:07:22.910 --> 05:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
adjustments in this
 
05:07:25.830 --> 05:07:25.840 align:start position:0%
um in this uh proposal that's in front
 
05:07:29.310 --> 05:07:29.320 align:start position:0%
of us um those can easily be made in the
 
05:07:33.190 --> 05:07:33.200 align:start position:0%
context of of a budget um so it all fits
 
05:07:38.030 --> 05:07:38.040 align:start position:0%
together pretty well and u i favor it
 
05:07:41.750 --> 05:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
good um further comments representative
 
05:07:44.590 --> 05:07:44.600 align:start position:0%
Tucker yeah I'm I'm a little surprised
 
05:07:47.910 --> 05:07:47.920 align:start position:0%
that the advice that we from an auditor
 
05:07:49.670 --> 05:07:49.680 align:start position:0%
isn't being
 
05:07:54.548 --> 05:07:54.558 align:start position:0%
taken um that there there must be a way
 
05:07:57.230 --> 05:07:57.240 align:start position:0%
to that one would go about this that an
 
05:08:00.390 --> 05:08:00.400 align:start position:0%
auditor would know if nothing else I'm
 
05:08:03.350 --> 05:08:03.360 align:start position:0%
surprised that the Bond
 
05:08:06.590 --> 05:08:06.600 align:start position:0%
Council uh who represents the state when
 
05:08:08.990 --> 05:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
it is bonding money doesn't have an
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
opinion but I think those are sort of
 
05:08:13.548 --> 05:08:13.558 align:start position:0%
the two
 
05:08:16.708 --> 05:08:16.718 align:start position:0%
mainstream ways of coming up with a
 
05:08:19.910 --> 05:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
solution yeah well the the Auditors if
 
05:08:22.910 --> 05:08:22.920 align:start position:0%
you read their reports are are
 
05:08:26.628 --> 05:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
concerned uh but for some reason and
 
05:08:28.670 --> 05:08:28.680 align:start position:0%
they have been concerned over time but
 
05:08:30.788 --> 05:08:30.798 align:start position:0%
for some
 
05:08:32.788 --> 05:08:32.798 align:start position:0%
reason legis
 
05:08:32.798 --> 05:08:33.990 align:start position:0%
reason legis
hasn't

05:08:33.990 --> 05:08:34.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't
 
05:08:36.510 --> 05:08:36.520 align:start position:0%
reacted well it really shouldn't have to
 
05:08:37.708 --> 05:08:37.718 align:start position:0%
I mean this is something where the
 
05:08:39.150 --> 05:08:39.160 align:start position:0%
auditor pretty
 
05:08:41.948 --> 05:08:41.958 align:start position:0%
well should have the Reigns and
 
05:08:44.750 --> 05:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
certainly Bond counsel my dealings with
 
05:08:47.110 --> 05:08:47.120 align:start position:0%
Bond counsel is that they're they're
 
05:08:48.990 --> 05:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
they're very firm about this sort of
 
05:08:52.788 --> 05:08:52.798 align:start position:0%
thing and any undue risk at all is
 
05:08:56.788 --> 05:08:56.798 align:start position:0%
something to be avoided so uh I can't
 
05:08:59.230 --> 05:08:59.240 align:start position:0%
believe that we need to
 
05:09:03.150 --> 05:09:03.160 align:start position:0%
be concerned with coming up with
 
05:09:06.470 --> 05:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:09:11.948 --> 05:09:11.958 align:start position:0%
solution okay representa AMS followed by
 
05:09:14.830 --> 05:09:14.840 align:start position:0%
representative I'm sorry I I had meant
 
05:09:18.030 --> 05:09:18.040 align:start position:0%
to take my hand down representative
 
05:09:20.750 --> 05:09:20.760 align:start position:0%
bromy followed by representative Elmer
 
05:09:22.628 --> 05:09:22.638 align:start position:0%
so for we're gonna move forward with
 
05:09:25.628 --> 05:09:25.638 align:start position:0%
this we got to decide if representative
 
05:09:29.430 --> 05:09:29.440 align:start position:0%
bromy yes thank you Mr chair uh if we're
 
05:09:31.150 --> 05:09:31.160 align:start position:0%
going to move forward with this we've
 
05:09:32.750 --> 05:09:32.760 align:start position:0%
got to decide if we want the commission
 
05:09:35.548 --> 05:09:35.558 align:start position:0%
to be done with its work November one of
 
05:09:35.558 --> 05:09:36.430 align:start position:0%
to be done with its work November one of
of

05:09:36.430 --> 05:09:36.440 align:start position:0%
of
 
05:09:40.190 --> 05:09:40.200 align:start position:0%
2021 or November one of of
 
05:09:42.548 --> 05:09:42.558 align:start position:0%
20122 that's the usual dates for the
 
05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
ends of of commissions November 1st of a
 
05:09:50.030 --> 05:09:50.040 align:start position:0%
year um and the other thing is that we I
 
05:09:52.230 --> 05:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
think today we have to come up with are
 
05:09:56.350 --> 05:09:56.360 align:start position:0%
we GNA select this last version because
 
05:09:59.670 --> 05:09:59.680 align:start position:0%
we need to come up with uh estimates for
 
05:10:03.070 --> 05:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
fiscal of the impact for 20 2 and
 
05:10:05.590 --> 05:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
23 uh if it's this one then it's the
 
05:10:07.948 --> 05:10:07.958 align:start position:0%
it's up to we'd have to we should as a
 
05:10:10.270 --> 05:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
group estimate we want to pick the
 
05:10:12.910 --> 05:10:12.920 align:start position:0%
midpoint of the zero to five million and
 
05:10:15.708 --> 05:10:15.718 align:start position:0%
the midpoint of 800,000 to 14
 
05:10:17.830 --> 05:10:17.840 align:start position:0%
million I think those are the two issues
 
05:10:19.750 --> 05:10:19.760 align:start position:0%
that we got to deal with right now uh
 
05:10:22.708 --> 05:10:22.718 align:start position:0%
and agree on well three things first do
 
05:10:24.590 --> 05:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
we want to
 
05:10:29.310 --> 05:10:29.320 align:start position:0%
accept the 500% 20 250%
 
05:10:32.868 --> 05:10:32.878 align:start position:0%
version and then ifs then what what kind
 
05:10:36.350 --> 05:10:36.360 align:start position:0%
of Revenue impact do we want to um give
 
05:10:39.230 --> 05:10:39.240 align:start position:0%
to to fiscal and then we have to just
 
05:10:41.548 --> 05:10:41.558 align:start position:0%
pick our a dates that and then also the
 
05:10:44.470 --> 05:10:44.480 align:start position:0%
structure of the commission uh I don't
 
05:10:45.990 --> 05:10:46.000 align:start position:0%
know if we need to do that as a group or
 
05:10:49.510 --> 05:10:49.520 align:start position:0%
not I think someone can maybe a couple
 
05:10:52.230 --> 05:10:52.240 align:start position:0%
of us can get together and and and come
 
05:10:54.230 --> 05:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
up with what that structure
 
05:10:59.990 --> 05:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:03.670 --> 05:11:03.680 align:start position:0%
Bry representative spilburg
 
05:11:06.708 --> 05:11:06.718 align:start position:0%
yes thank you Mr chairman um I like the
 
05:11:15.190 --> 05:11:15.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:11:18.190 --> 05:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
27550 over four consecutive years
 
05:11:20.430 --> 05:11:20.440 align:start position:0%
that'ss too aggressive uh I'm just
 
05:11:24.190 --> 05:11:24.200 align:start position:0%
looking at the last chart and wondering
 
05:11:27.270 --> 05:11:27.280 align:start position:0%
why did Dr prepare it with such
 
05:11:29.270 --> 05:11:29.280 align:start position:0%
significant time lags rather than in
 
05:11:32.390 --> 05:11:32.400 align:start position:0%
consecutive years as is the case with
 
05:11:35.470 --> 05:11:35.480 align:start position:0%
the prior uh Alternatives so this really
 
05:11:36.670 --> 05:11:36.680 align:start position:0%
stages it
 
05:11:38.910 --> 05:11:38.920 align:start position:0%
out all the way to
 
05:11:43.510 --> 05:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
2030 with adjustments in 22 25 and 27
 
05:11:44.788 --> 05:11:44.798 align:start position:0%
what's the thinking was it just to
 
05:11:47.548 --> 05:11:47.558 align:start position:0%
stretch it out as far as
 
05:11:51.470 --> 05:11:51.480 align:start position:0%
possible I would imagine so but to at
 
05:11:55.150 --> 05:11:55.160 align:start position:0%
least get the uh the process started so
 
05:11:57.670 --> 05:11:57.680 align:start position:0%
it doesn't hurt that much to begin with
 
05:12:00.390 --> 05:12:00.400 align:start position:0%
but as far as the other question
 
05:12:05.548 --> 05:12:05.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:09.628 --> 05:12:09.638 align:start position:0%
24 why settled down to a small amount so
 
05:12:13.548 --> 05:12:13.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:16.470 --> 05:12:16.480 align:start position:0%
that sure thanks for your question um I
 
05:12:18.310 --> 05:12:18.320 align:start position:0%
think we did this yeser uh did this
 
05:12:20.510 --> 05:12:20.520 align:start position:0%
yesterday based on some feedback that we
 
05:12:21.910 --> 05:12:21.920 align:start position:0%
got from the committee I think one of
 
05:12:23.470 --> 05:12:23.480 align:start position:0%
the options someone put forth and I'm
 
05:12:25.750 --> 05:12:25.760 align:start position:0%
sorry I don't remember who did was just
 
05:12:29.670 --> 05:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
to have a phase in every two years um so
 
05:12:32.948 --> 05:12:32.958 align:start position:0%
we did we ran like I say we ran multiple
 
05:12:35.150 --> 05:12:35.160 align:start position:0%
scenarios yesterday and they didn't have
 
05:12:36.868 --> 05:12:36.878 align:start position:0%
much of a difference from some of the
 
05:12:39.110 --> 05:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
other ones that we did so we didn't
 
05:12:42.270 --> 05:12:42.280 align:start position:0%
present them because the the the
 
05:12:45.070 --> 05:12:45.080 align:start position:0%
differences weren't enough to matter um
 
05:12:47.070 --> 05:12:47.080 align:start position:0%
but then when we ran this one this one
 
05:12:49.708 --> 05:12:49.718 align:start position:0%
had more of a difference because we're
 
05:12:52.750 --> 05:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
starting at that higher 500% and then to
 
05:12:56.430 --> 05:12:56.440 align:start position:0%
the 250 with the two-year lag um we did
 
05:12:59.230 --> 05:12:59.240 align:start position:0%
200% to 100% with a 2-year lag and again
 
05:13:01.868 --> 05:13:01.878 align:start position:0%
it wasn't much of a difference and again
 
05:13:03.548 --> 05:13:03.558 align:start position:0%
again for
 
05:13:05.868 --> 05:13:05.878 align:start position:0%
2025 I think representative major you
 
05:13:07.510 --> 05:13:07.520 align:start position:0%
were just asking the four to five
 
05:13:09.788 --> 05:13:09.798 align:start position:0%
million at that
 
05:13:11.788 --> 05:13:11.798 align:start position:0%
point that again is because you're
 
05:13:14.590 --> 05:13:14.600 align:start position:0%
starting a new tax year at that point
 
05:13:16.310 --> 05:13:16.320 align:start position:0%
because of the two-year lag so if you
 
05:13:18.788 --> 05:13:18.798 align:start position:0%
look up top in the title in tax year
 
05:13:21.590 --> 05:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
2025 we reduce it to
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
250% and at that point you're feeling a
 
05:13:27.270 --> 05:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
little bit of the leftover from
 
05:13:30.030 --> 05:13:30.040 align:start position:0%
2022 but the bulk of it is just the
 
05:13:32.070 --> 05:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
estimates that that quarter of the
 
05:13:35.590 --> 05:13:35.600 align:start position:0%
estimates for for um tax year 2025 and
 
05:13:37.590 --> 05:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
then as you continue you then get
 
05:13:39.390 --> 05:13:39.400 align:start position:0%
returns for
 
05:13:43.750 --> 05:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:46.390 --> 05:13:46.400 align:start position:0%
there representa
 
05:13:50.190 --> 05:13:50.200 align:start position:0%
Aly thank you Mr chairman I wanted to
 
05:13:52.310 --> 05:13:52.320 align:start position:0%
answer representative spilsbury's
 
05:13:54.590 --> 05:13:54.600 align:start position:0%
question the main reason for this and I
 
05:13:56.270 --> 05:13:56.280 align:start position:0%
think I may have been the one that
 
05:13:58.708 --> 05:13:58.718 align:start position:0%
suggested maybe going two years in
 
05:14:03.910 --> 05:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
between on the the main reason for doing
 
05:14:07.390 --> 05:14:07.400 align:start position:0%
that is to make this tolerable to the
 
05:14:10.670 --> 05:14:10.680 align:start position:0%
state budget we have an extremely
 
05:14:10.680 --> 05:14:12.628 align:start position:0%
state budget we have an extremely
closely

05:14:12.628 --> 05:14:12.638 align:start position:0%
closely
 
05:14:17.830 --> 05:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
budgeted uh culture in this state and we
 
05:14:21.390 --> 05:14:21.400 align:start position:0%
very rarely have any room for
 
05:14:23.830 --> 05:14:23.840 align:start position:0%
Investments that we would make that
 
05:14:26.270 --> 05:14:26.280 align:start position:0%
would make things more effective or less
 
05:14:29.470 --> 05:14:29.480 align:start position:0%
risky and in this case it's kind of like
 
05:14:31.868 --> 05:14:31.878 align:start position:0%
why isn't the pension system fully
 
05:14:34.750 --> 05:14:34.760 align:start position:0%
funded right now we wouldn't be able to
 
05:14:38.830 --> 05:14:38.840 align:start position:0%
do anything else if we did that and we
 
05:14:40.788 --> 05:14:40.798 align:start position:0%
found out that it was way
 
05:14:44.310 --> 05:14:44.320 align:start position:0%
underfunded uh in
 
05:14:47.830 --> 05:14:47.840 align:start position:0%
2007 and are still dealing with that
 
05:14:51.230 --> 05:14:51.240 align:start position:0%
slowly over a long period of time and
 
05:14:53.948 --> 05:14:53.958 align:start position:0%
this is is meant to reduce the risk but
 
05:14:58.470 --> 05:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
if we reduce this risk uh abruptly we
 
05:15:01.670 --> 05:15:01.680 align:start position:0%
end up without substance abuse treatment
 
05:15:04.270 --> 05:15:04.280 align:start position:0%
we end up without prisons we end up
 
05:15:08.270 --> 05:15:08.280 align:start position:0%
without a lot of basic necessities of of
 
05:15:10.990 --> 05:15:11.000 align:start position:0%
the government and the economy thank
 
05:15:14.310 --> 05:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
you okay I don't see any hands up so
 
05:15:16.470 --> 05:15:16.480 align:start position:0%
I've got a
 
05:15:19.390 --> 05:15:19.400 align:start position:0%
question um the options
 
05:15:21.788 --> 05:15:21.798 align:start position:0%
are just to do
 
05:15:21.798 --> 05:15:23.868 align:start position:0%
are just to do
a

05:15:23.868 --> 05:15:23.878 align:start position:0%
a
 
05:15:30.070 --> 05:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
commission or just to do a phase in of
 
05:15:33.030 --> 05:15:33.040 align:start position:0%
one of these options
 
05:15:39.390 --> 05:15:39.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:43.310 --> 05:15:43.320 align:start position:0%
combination is there anybody here that
 
05:15:50.070 --> 05:15:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:53.470 --> 05:15:53.480 align:start position:0%
commission guess I'm gonna do
 
05:15:58.948 --> 05:15:58.958 align:start position:0%
that without doing any phases phasing in
 
05:16:02.350 --> 05:16:02.360 align:start position:0%
so for just a commission
 
05:16:05.270 --> 05:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
you have represented Malloy
 
05:16:09.110 --> 05:16:09.120 align:start position:0%
Phillips Ames and
 
05:16:13.590 --> 05:16:13.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:18.070 --> 05:16:18.080 align:start position:0%
burin oh and burn okay sorry about
 
05:16:20.708 --> 05:16:20.718 align:start position:0%
that next question
 
05:16:24.190 --> 05:16:24.200 align:start position:0%
is just by phas
 
05:16:24.200 --> 05:16:25.750 align:start position:0%
is just by phas
in

05:16:25.750 --> 05:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:16:29.230 --> 05:16:29.240 align:start position:0%
who who wants to do a just a phase in
 
05:16:34.350 --> 05:16:34.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:37.948 --> 05:16:37.958 align:start position:0%
uh nobody so the other option is to do a
 
05:16:51.510 --> 05:16:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:54.270 --> 05:16:54.280 align:start position:0%
that so it looks like the
 
05:16:57.910 --> 05:16:57.920 align:start position:0%
majority now just to clarify I I didn't
 
05:16:59.948 --> 05:16:59.958 align:start position:0%
vote for that last one but that's not
 
05:17:02.510 --> 05:17:02.520 align:start position:0%
because I'm against it as I said I my
 
05:17:04.708 --> 05:17:04.718 align:start position:0%
preference would be just the commission
 
05:17:07.548 --> 05:17:07.558 align:start position:0%
so it was a matter of
 
05:17:07.558 --> 05:17:09.868 align:start position:0%
so it was a matter of
preference

05:17:09.868 --> 05:17:09.878 align:start position:0%
preference
 
05:17:12.510 --> 05:17:12.520 align:start position:0%
um so since it's going to be a
 
05:17:15.150 --> 05:17:15.160 align:start position:0%
combination of both the commission and a
 
05:17:15.160 --> 05:17:17.670 align:start position:0%
combination of both the commission and a
phase

05:17:17.670 --> 05:17:17.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:21.230 --> 05:17:21.240 align:start position:0%
in why don't we start with the last one
 
05:17:23.948 --> 05:17:23.958 align:start position:0%
first who would be in favor of the one
 
05:17:28.670 --> 05:17:28.680 align:start position:0%
that gives the longest phas in
 
05:17:32.230 --> 05:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
the the smallest amount
 
05:17:36.750 --> 05:17:36.760 align:start position:0%
of uh disruption in the front years and
 
05:17:39.110 --> 05:17:39.120 align:start position:0%
that allows the commission time to do
 
05:17:39.120 --> 05:17:39.910 align:start position:0%
that allows the commission time to do
the

05:17:39.910 --> 05:17:39.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:17:43.948 --> 05:17:43.958 align:start position:0%
work this looks like the vast majority
 
05:17:43.958 --> 05:17:45.708 align:start position:0%
work this looks like the vast majority
do

05:17:45.708 --> 05:17:45.718 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:17:51.430 --> 05:17:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:17:54.708 --> 05:17:54.718 align:start position:0%
is should we come up with a different
 
05:17:58.110 --> 05:17:58.120 align:start position:0%
phase in or are we okay with a phase in
 
05:18:01.868 --> 05:18:01.878 align:start position:0%
that Melissa described in page three
 
05:18:04.830 --> 05:18:04.840 align:start position:0%
with the 500 capping at
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
500% in tax year 22
 
05:18:14.070 --> 05:18:14.080 align:start position:0%
250% at tax year 25 and 100% tax year 27
 
05:18:16.948 --> 05:18:16.958 align:start position:0%
who would be in favor of that M Mr
 
05:18:18.628 --> 05:18:18.638 align:start position:0%
chairman this is representative Nunes
 
05:18:21.430 --> 05:18:21.440 align:start position:0%
you asked two questions there uh you
 
05:18:23.670 --> 05:18:23.680 align:start position:0%
said is do we need a new one or do we
 
05:18:25.868 --> 05:18:25.878 align:start position:0%
want this one can we do one question at
 
05:18:29.750 --> 05:18:29.760 align:start position:0%
a time yeah sorry about that that's okay
 
05:18:32.670 --> 05:18:32.680 align:start position:0%
I just I'm I'm the confused person here
 
05:18:38.510 --> 05:18:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:47.430 --> 05:18:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:50.830 --> 05:18:50.840 align:start position:0%
schedule doesn't look like that many who
 
05:18:55.430 --> 05:18:55.440 align:start position:0%
likes the phase in shown on page three
 
05:19:00.230 --> 05:19:00.240 align:start position:0%
which has the 5% 500% 200% and 100% phas
 
05:19:00.240 --> 05:19:03.510 align:start position:0%
which has the 5% 500% 200% and 100% phas
in

05:19:03.510 --> 05:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:07.708 --> 05:19:07.718 align:start position:0%
it looks like the vast majority so then
 
05:19:15.350 --> 05:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:18.948 --> 05:19:18.958 align:start position:0%

continue to evaluate this

05:20:35.280 --> 05:20:37.708 align:start position:0%
uh any further
discussion

05:20:37.708 --> 05:20:37.718 align:start position:0%
discussion
 
05:20:40.708 --> 05:20:40.718 align:start position:0%
representan thank you Mr chairman um my
 
05:20:42.190 --> 05:20:42.200 align:start position:0%
question would be if we establish a
 
05:20:44.350 --> 05:20:44.360 align:start position:0%
commission should we have an end date
 
05:20:47.070 --> 05:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
for that Commission because um it might
 
05:20:48.470 --> 05:20:48.480 align:start position:0%
be wrong but I'm trying to think the
 
05:20:51.430 --> 05:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
second year of a bium don't we have to
 
05:20:54.590 --> 05:20:54.600 align:start position:0%
have new bills in by is it is it
 
05:20:56.470 --> 05:20:56.480 align:start position:0%
September or November so I just want to
 
05:20:57.868 --> 05:20:57.878 align:start position:0%
make sure that the commission ends at
 
05:21:02.030 --> 05:21:02.040 align:start position:0%
the right time yeah and a commission
 
05:21:02.040 --> 05:21:03.948 align:start position:0%
the right time yeah and a commission
uh

05:21:03.948 --> 05:21:03.958 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:21:11.708 --> 05:21:11.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:21:13.910 --> 05:21:13.920 align:start position:0%
date I've ched many
 
05:21:16.670 --> 05:21:16.680 align:start position:0%
commissions uh yeah November 1 is a
 
05:21:20.190 --> 05:21:20.200 align:start position:0%
magical date uh on the second year the
 
05:21:22.948 --> 05:21:22.958 align:start position:0%
election year uh the commission has to
 
05:21:25.430 --> 05:21:25.440 align:start position:0%
be done by its work before the election
 
05:21:27.430 --> 05:21:27.440 align:start position:0%
we are still State reps at that point if
 
05:21:30.070 --> 05:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
you're on a commission so uh what
 
05:21:31.788 --> 05:21:31.798 align:start position:0%
happens then there is still time after
 
05:21:33.510 --> 05:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
the election because new bills can be
 
05:21:36.270 --> 05:21:36.280 align:start position:0%
filed for the new members as well as old
 
05:21:39.548 --> 05:21:39.558 align:start position:0%
members so yes there is time to file a
 
05:21:43.110 --> 05:21:43.120 align:start position:0%
bill on the second year which would be
 
05:21:48.670 --> 05:21:48.680 align:start position:0%
23 uh uh and and make it into to that
 
05:21:53.350 --> 05:21:53.360 align:start position:0%
that next uh legislature's business
 
05:21:57.868 --> 05:21:57.878 align:start position:0%
yeah assumption that the
 
05:22:00.628 --> 05:22:00.638 align:start position:0%
commission house build once house build
 
05:22:03.030 --> 05:22:03.040 align:start position:0%
to passes that
 
05:22:06.830 --> 05:22:06.840 align:start position:0%
section uh is effective 30 days after
 
05:22:10.390 --> 05:22:10.400 align:start position:0%
passage so get the commission started as
 
05:22:13.628 --> 05:22:13.638 align:start position:0%
soon as possible yeah may I may I
 
05:22:16.430 --> 05:22:16.440 align:start position:0%
comment on that yes representative
 
05:22:21.190 --> 05:22:21.200 align:start position:0%
Ames I favor um a commission that would
 
05:22:23.990 --> 05:22:24.000 align:start position:0%
be tasked with getting its work
 
05:22:28.750 --> 05:22:28.760 align:start position:0%
done uh by November of this year
 
05:22:31.310 --> 05:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
November one if that's the right date uh
 
05:22:34.548 --> 05:22:34.558 align:start position:0%
rather than put it have it uh continue
 
05:22:38.190 --> 05:22:38.200 align:start position:0%
for another year um just because I
 
05:22:40.670 --> 05:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
think there'll be continuity that way
 
05:22:42.030 --> 05:22:42.040 align:start position:0%
the membership of the legislature
 
05:22:44.990 --> 05:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't change and um I think the work
 
05:22:46.750 --> 05:22:46.760 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about here can be
 
05:22:52.070 --> 05:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
done in relatively short order um with
 
05:22:55.548 --> 05:22:55.558 align:start position:0%
an intense effort so I I would favor
 
05:22:59.548 --> 05:22:59.558 align:start position:0%
that to give you a feel of when the
 
05:23:01.670 --> 05:23:01.680 align:start position:0%
commission would start
 
05:23:05.750 --> 05:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
usually the budgets doesn't finally pass
 
05:23:09.030 --> 05:23:09.040 align:start position:0%
and get signed until towards the end of
 
05:23:10.948 --> 05:23:10.958 align:start position:0%
June or maybe even to
 
05:23:14.310 --> 05:23:14.320 align:start position:0%
July and then the commission at that
 
05:23:17.230 --> 05:23:17.240 align:start position:0%
time would have to start within 30 days
 
05:23:20.030 --> 05:23:20.040 align:start position:0%
of that so they would have August
 
05:23:23.270 --> 05:23:23.280 align:start position:0%
through no November to get their work
 
05:23:27.628 --> 05:23:27.638 align:start position:0%
done so that's sufficient and it should
 
05:23:30.390 --> 05:23:30.400 align:start position:0%
be sufficient I just uh my personal
 
05:23:33.430 --> 05:23:33.440 align:start position:0%
experience I chaired the um gambling
 
05:23:34.948 --> 05:23:34.958 align:start position:0%
commission oversight
 
05:23:37.990 --> 05:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
commission uh maybe eight or nine years
 
05:23:40.310 --> 05:23:40.320 align:start position:0%
ago and that came out of the budget just
 
05:23:43.390 --> 05:23:43.400 align:start position:0%
as this one would and got right to work
 
05:23:46.750 --> 05:23:46.760 align:start position:0%
uh starting in Late July and did a heck
 
05:23:49.830 --> 05:23:49.840 align:start position:0%
of a lot of work um and got a report
 
05:23:51.590 --> 05:23:51.600 align:start position:0%
done by the beginning of
 
05:23:53.910 --> 05:23:53.920 align:start position:0%
November um that was a pretty
 
05:23:56.070 --> 05:23:56.080 align:start position:0%
complicated undertaking I think this is
 
05:23:59.030 --> 05:23:59.040 align:start position:0%
much less so so I think it's totally
 
05:24:03.590 --> 05:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
manageable yeah and likewise I I chair
 
05:24:08.190 --> 05:24:08.200 align:start position:0%
that Wayfair commission which is
 
05:24:11.948 --> 05:24:11.958 align:start position:0%
sh I think that was from July to to
 
05:24:14.430 --> 05:24:14.440 align:start position:0%
November or
 
05:24:14.440 --> 05:24:16.788 align:start position:0%
November or
so

05:24:16.788 --> 05:24:16.798 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
um so any further discussion yes
 
05:24:22.320 --> 05:24:29.750 align:start position:0%
um so any further discussion yes
representative

05:24:29.750 --> 05:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:29.760 --> 05:24:34.110 align:start position:0%
 
Tucker

05:24:34.110 --> 05:24:34.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:35.868 --> 05:24:35.878 align:start position:0%
represent Tucker you had your hand up
 
05:24:37.830 --> 05:24:37.840 align:start position:0%
did you want to
 
05:24:42.708 --> 05:24:42.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:46.430 --> 05:24:46.440 align:start position:0%
tuer uh it I took my hand down some time
 
05:24:50.990 --> 05:24:51.000 align:start position:0%
ago I I'm sorry okay uh representor
 
05:24:54.830 --> 05:24:54.840 align:start position:0%
bronley yeah um this is what happens so
 
05:24:59.190 --> 05:24:59.200 align:start position:0%
I agree let's make it to uh November 1st
 
05:25:02.110 --> 05:25:02.120 align:start position:0%
22 uh when I when when I was involved
 
05:25:04.910 --> 05:25:04.920 align:start position:0%
with the market-based sourcing un Andi
 
05:25:08.270 --> 05:25:08.280 align:start position:0%
Norm uh and uh a
 
05:25:11.230 --> 05:25:11.240 align:start position:0%
commission after that first year we
 
05:25:13.548 --> 05:25:13.558 align:start position:0%
decided we need more time so we filed a
 
05:25:16.548 --> 05:25:16.558 align:start position:0%
bill to give ourselves another year so
 
05:25:18.110 --> 05:25:18.120 align:start position:0%
this could happen in this one if we run
 
05:25:21.350 --> 05:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
into problems we can always extend it so
 
05:25:24.708 --> 05:25:24.718 align:start position:0%
I I'll I'm going to amend my my motion
 
05:25:27.310 --> 05:25:27.320 align:start position:0%
to say that the commission should
 
05:25:29.670 --> 05:25:29.680 align:start position:0%
complete its work by November 1st
 
05:25:29.680 --> 05:25:33.030 align:start position:0%
complete its work by November 1st
2022

05:25:33.030 --> 05:25:33.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:25:33.040 --> 05:25:34.708 align:start position:0%

05:26:48.110 --> 05:26:48.120 align:start position:0%
there which it would really help to know
 
05:26:51.628 --> 05:26:51.638 align:start position:0%
okay hold up represent Aly uh
 
05:26:51.638 --> 05:26:52.990 align:start position:0%
okay hold up represent Aly uh
representative

05:26:52.990 --> 05:26:53.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:26:56.750 --> 05:26:56.760 align:start position:0%
Bernstein you're clerk would you take
 
05:26:59.470 --> 05:26:59.480 align:start position:0%
down the type of positions we want to
 
05:27:01.750 --> 05:27:01.760 align:start position:0%
put in this Commission sure so far we
 
05:27:03.990 --> 05:27:04.000 align:start position:0%
have one from the Dr one from the
 
05:27:06.830 --> 05:27:06.840 align:start position:0%
controller one from the treasurer and
 
05:27:08.788 --> 05:27:08.798 align:start position:0%
then a high level
 
05:27:10.470 --> 05:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
accountant is that correct
 
05:27:14.350 --> 05:27:14.360 align:start position:0%
representative Aly yes thank you Norm I
 
05:27:16.350 --> 05:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
think I just we gotta I think the way
 
05:27:18.470 --> 05:27:18.480 align:start position:0%
the language usually read is the
 
05:27:19.750 --> 05:27:19.760 align:start position:0%
controller or
 
05:27:23.390 --> 05:27:23.400 align:start position:0%
designate the treasurer or design each
 
05:27:24.750 --> 05:27:24.760 align:start position:0%
each one of them with
 
05:27:28.190 --> 05:27:28.200 align:start position:0%
the right or the commissioner of Revenue
 
05:27:32.270 --> 05:27:32.280 align:start position:0%
Administration or or design
 
05:27:33.830 --> 05:27:33.840 align:start position:0%
and then who who do we want to appoint
 
05:27:35.270 --> 05:27:35.280 align:start position:0%
the accountant do we want the governor
 
05:27:41.110 --> 05:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:45.470 --> 05:27:45.480 align:start position:0%
that the speaker would appoint the the
 
05:27:47.708 --> 05:27:47.718 align:start position:0%
representatives and
 
05:27:51.230 --> 05:27:51.240 align:start position:0%
the to be on there and the Senate
 
05:27:54.750 --> 05:27:54.760 align:start position:0%
President would appoint the Senators the
 
05:27:59.430 --> 05:27:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:59.440 --> 05:28:03.230 align:start position:0%
 
um

05:28:03.230 --> 05:28:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:06.868 --> 05:28:06.878 align:start position:0%
C yes but if you had a suggestion you
 
05:28:08.230 --> 05:28:08.240 align:start position:0%
could give it to the governor because
 
05:28:10.030 --> 05:28:10.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise it might take a
 
05:28:10.040 --> 05:28:12.590 align:start position:0%
otherwise it might take a
while

05:28:12.590 --> 05:28:12.600 align:start position:0%
while
 
05:28:15.150 --> 05:28:15.160 align:start position:0%
yeah um now who
 
05:28:18.310 --> 05:28:18.320 align:start position:0%
else should make up the commission it
 
05:28:22.868 --> 05:28:22.878 align:start position:0%
should be somebody that understands
 
05:28:27.270 --> 05:28:27.280 align:start position:0%
taxes understands accounting and
 
05:28:29.390 --> 05:28:29.400 align:start position:0%
understands the
 
05:28:29.400 --> 05:28:33.390 align:start position:0%
understands the
accounting

05:28:33.390 --> 05:28:33.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:36.150 --> 05:28:36.160 align:start position:0%
well you're asking for an accountant do
 
05:28:38.030 --> 05:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
we have any on ways and means that would
 
05:28:44.230 --> 05:28:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:46.830 --> 05:28:46.840 align:start position:0%
Senate we could get representative love
 
05:28:46.840 --> 05:28:47.948 align:start position:0%
Senate we could get representative love
joy

05:28:47.948 --> 05:28:47.958 align:start position:0%
joy
 
05:28:50.670 --> 05:28:50.680 align:start position:0%
back yeah that would be useful
 
05:28:52.830 --> 05:28:52.840 align:start position:0%
truthfully that would be
 
05:28:55.470 --> 05:28:55.480 align:start position:0%
useful but
 
05:28:59.190 --> 05:28:59.200 align:start position:0%
um if we could get somebody from a a
 
05:29:02.628 --> 05:29:02.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:06.150 --> 05:29:06.160 align:start position:0%
accounting firm well we just asked the
 
05:29:08.430 --> 05:29:08.440 align:start position:0%
uh they come up here and testify
 
05:29:10.750 --> 05:29:10.760 align:start position:0%
everyone call the New Hampshire
 
05:29:12.390 --> 05:29:12.400 align:start position:0%
Association of accountants whatever
 
05:29:12.400 --> 05:29:14.030 align:start position:0%
Association of accountants whatever
they're

05:29:14.030 --> 05:29:14.040 align:start position:0%
they're
 
05:29:17.310 --> 05:29:17.320 align:start position:0%
called representative Smith do you have
 
05:29:17.320 --> 05:29:22.750 align:start position:0%
called representative Smith do you have
any

05:29:22.750 --> 05:29:22.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:24.910 --> 05:29:24.920 align:start position:0%
recommendations I'm thinking about that
 
05:29:26.910 --> 05:29:26.920 align:start position:0%
I'm not comfortable with the language
 
05:29:30.910 --> 05:29:30.920 align:start position:0%
High powerered accounting firm because
 
05:29:35.030 --> 05:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
um I'm not sure that that necessarily um
 
05:29:41.948 --> 05:29:41.958 align:start position:0%
is the sole determin of Merit um but
 
05:29:45.150 --> 05:29:45.160 align:start position:0%
um I don't have a particular person I'm
 
05:29:49.110 --> 05:29:49.120 align:start position:0%
wondering if we should ask
 
05:29:54.470 --> 05:29:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:29:58.510 --> 05:29:58.520 align:start position:0%
LBA um about that
 
05:30:04.670 --> 05:30:04.680 align:start position:0%
um or ask the controller the Dr you know
 
05:30:09.510 --> 05:30:09.520 align:start position:0%
Dr those people uh the treasurer about a
 
05:30:13.270 --> 05:30:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:16.590 --> 05:30:16.600 align:start position:0%
suggestion and we
 
05:30:16.600 --> 05:30:19.510 align:start position:0%
suggestion and we
could

05:30:19.510 --> 05:30:19.520 align:start position:0%
could
 
05:30:23.430 --> 05:30:23.440 align:start position:0%
have slots maybe three other
 
05:30:26.310 --> 05:30:26.320 align:start position:0%
positions with recommendations coming
 
05:30:26.320 --> 05:30:27.590 align:start position:0%
positions with recommendations coming
from

05:30:27.590 --> 05:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
from
 
05:30:32.030 --> 05:30:32.040 align:start position:0%
the the Dr and the lb
 
05:30:37.350 --> 05:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:30:41.548 --> 05:30:41.558 align:start position:0%
sure we're not going to solve it right
 
05:30:44.030 --> 05:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
now let's do the simple one how many
 
05:30:47.150 --> 05:30:47.160 align:start position:0%
senators how many how many uh
 
05:30:47.160 --> 05:30:49.030 align:start position:0%
senators how many how many uh
Representatives

05:30:49.030 --> 05:30:49.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives
 
05:30:53.190 --> 05:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
yeah I would imagine that you want to
 
05:30:57.830 --> 05:30:57.840 align:start position:0%
have finance and ways and means
 
05:31:01.670 --> 05:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
covered uh in both the house and the
 
05:31:06.590 --> 05:31:06.600 align:start position:0%
Senate so maybe three from the house two
 
05:31:12.310 --> 05:31:12.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:31:14.548 --> 05:31:14.558 align:start position:0%
Senate and the Senate will cut it down
 
05:31:18.430 --> 05:31:18.440 align:start position:0%
to one I know if they cut it down a one
 
05:31:21.070 --> 05:31:21.080 align:start position:0%
we put it to four make it four and two
 
05:31:22.470 --> 05:31:22.480 align:start position:0%
if we're gonna invite if we're could
 
05:31:25.510 --> 05:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
also invite some Finance
 
05:31:28.670 --> 05:31:28.680 align:start position:0%
members is extremely
 
05:31:30.830 --> 05:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
important why don't we say four and two
 
05:31:32.990 --> 05:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
they you're right probably only one
 
05:31:37.430 --> 05:31:37.440 align:start position:0%
Senator will actually be assigned but um
 
05:31:39.948 --> 05:31:39.958 align:start position:0%
I would say four and
 
05:31:42.590 --> 05:31:42.600 align:start position:0%
two I I think the stress should be on
 
05:31:45.030 --> 05:31:45.040 align:start position:0%
the ways and means uh committee not
 
05:31:46.830 --> 05:31:46.840 align:start position:0%
evenly between Ways and Means and
 
05:31:50.868 --> 05:31:50.878 align:start position:0%
finance because of the nature of the the
 
05:31:53.590 --> 05:31:53.600 align:start position:0%
question so if you had one Finance
 
05:31:57.390 --> 05:31:57.400 align:start position:0%
person and then either two or three ways
 
05:32:00.230 --> 05:32:00.240 align:start position:0%
and means I think you'd have the right
 
05:32:02.510 --> 05:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
the right balance says I as the former
 
05:32:06.190 --> 05:32:06.200 align:start position:0%
chair of the finance committee um but I
 
05:32:07.310 --> 05:32:07.320 align:start position:0%
think the
 
05:32:10.270 --> 05:32:10.280 align:start position:0%
question is a question that clearly
 
05:32:13.150 --> 05:32:13.160 align:start position:0%
Falls within um The Silo of the Ways and
 
05:32:13.160 --> 05:32:14.590 align:start position:0%
Falls within um The Silo of the Ways and
Means

05:32:14.590 --> 05:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
Means
 
05:32:16.628 --> 05:32:16.638 align:start position:0%
Committee shouldn't that includes
 
05:32:18.230 --> 05:32:18.240 align:start position:0%
someone from Ways and Means from both
 
05:32:20.750 --> 05:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
the Senate and the house that's up to
 
05:32:24.788 --> 05:32:24.798 align:start position:0%
them thank you oh good point there two
 
05:32:28.310 --> 05:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
committees over clap each other a lot
 
05:32:31.070 --> 05:32:31.080 align:start position:0%
for the uh new members remember that the
 
05:32:33.628 --> 05:32:33.638 align:start position:0%
Senate doesn't do
 
05:32:36.590 --> 05:32:36.600 align:start position:0%
anything now representative
 
05:32:41.070 --> 05:32:41.080 align:start position:0%
oler you're not supposed to share that
 
05:32:45.750 --> 05:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
information okay could I suggest the uh
 
05:32:48.628 --> 05:32:48.638 align:start position:0%
accountant that was is from Portsmouth
 
05:32:50.430 --> 05:32:50.440 align:start position:0%
and I can't remember his name but was
 
05:32:53.470 --> 05:32:53.480 align:start position:0%
head of the business tax commission that
 
05:32:58.628 --> 05:32:58.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:33:02.030 --> 05:33:02.040 align:start position:0%
yeah okay we have a framework we're not
 
05:33:04.750 --> 05:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
going to solve everything right now and
 
05:33:07.708 --> 05:33:07.718 align:start position:0%
the names aren't going to go into the
 
05:33:11.430 --> 05:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
into the uh the legislation so you have
 
05:33:14.390 --> 05:33:14.400 align:start position:0%
time to come up with a specific name
 
05:33:17.190 --> 05:33:17.200 align:start position:0%
right we need to take a vote also have
 
05:33:17.200 --> 05:33:18.390 align:start position:0%
right we need to take a vote also have
time

05:33:18.390 --> 05:33:18.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:33:22.470 --> 05:33:22.480 align:start position:0%
to for the definition and and the goals
 
05:33:26.390 --> 05:33:26.400 align:start position:0%
and all that not an awful lot of time
 
05:33:30.270 --> 05:33:30.280 align:start position:0%
but I think we need to just vote on the
 
05:33:32.150 --> 05:33:32.160 align:start position:0%
concept right
 
05:33:35.070 --> 05:33:35.080 align:start position:0%
now and make sure that Mr Shay is clear
 
05:33:38.948 --> 05:33:38.958 align:start position:0%
on what you want to go into the
 
05:33:43.030 --> 05:33:43.040 align:start position:0%
uh the language for House Bill too then
 
05:33:47.590 --> 05:33:47.600 align:start position:0%
what Chris will do he will generate
 
05:33:50.230 --> 05:33:50.240 align:start position:0%
something get it back to us so we can
 
05:33:51.310 --> 05:33:51.320 align:start position:0%
look it
 
05:33:56.670 --> 05:33:56.680 align:start position:0%
over that quickly to see if if it's what
 
05:34:00.030 --> 05:34:00.040 align:start position:0%
we want make our comments and update and
 
05:34:03.270 --> 05:34:03.280 align:start position:0%
then uh we can finish
 
05:34:12.270 --> 05:34:12.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:15.430 --> 05:34:15.440 align:start position:0%
tomorrow I've got to take this one Pat
 
05:34:18.230 --> 05:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:34:22.948 --> 05:34:22.958 align:start position:0%
over a question Susan I'm sorry on well
 
05:34:26.708 --> 05:34:26.718 align:start position:0%
he he says that Chris should go away and
 
05:34:28.708 --> 05:34:28.718 align:start position:0%
generate the language and then we should
 
05:34:31.910 --> 05:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
look it over and I'm asking whether
 
05:34:35.270 --> 05:34:35.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this this afternoon or
 
05:34:35.280 --> 05:34:37.070 align:start position:0%
we're going to do this this afternoon or
tomorrow

05:34:37.070 --> 05:34:37.080 align:start position:0%
tomorrow
 
05:34:39.910 --> 05:34:39.920 align:start position:0%
sometime tomorrow is our deadline well
 
05:34:41.910 --> 05:34:41.920 align:start position:0%
tomorrow is a deadline to get uh our
 
05:34:44.590 --> 05:34:44.600 align:start position:0%
Revenue estimates to fiscal I think we
 
05:34:47.270 --> 05:34:47.280 align:start position:0%
we could have a couple extra days to get
 
05:34:51.150 --> 05:34:51.160 align:start position:0%
them this revised Amendment this this
 
05:34:54.150 --> 05:34:54.160 align:start position:0%
amendment hb2 I don't think I don't
 
05:34:56.430 --> 05:34:56.440 align:start position:0%
think F Friday they wanted a number
 
05:34:59.390 --> 05:34:59.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal one we we will need to vote on a
 
05:35:02.030 --> 05:35:02.040 align:start position:0%
number for credit carry forward then yes
 
05:35:03.548 --> 05:35:03.558 align:start position:0%
we still have to do that that's the last
 
05:35:07.190 --> 05:35:07.200 align:start position:0%
thing we have to do
 
05:35:12.990 --> 05:35:13.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:35:15.310 --> 05:35:15.320 align:start position:0%
I was just going to make the same point
 
05:35:17.150 --> 05:35:17.160 align:start position:0%
that we need to come up for the figures
 
05:35:22.350 --> 05:35:22.360 align:start position:0%
on hb2 okay representative burin yeah I
 
05:35:24.310 --> 05:35:24.320 align:start position:0%
just want to review this commission and
 
05:35:26.470 --> 05:35:26.480 align:start position:0%
maybe we can get this done before uh
 
05:35:30.110 --> 05:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
Norm gets back okay so right now uh and
 
05:35:31.470 --> 05:35:31.480 align:start position:0%
I just pulled from what everyone was
 
05:35:33.910 --> 05:35:33.920 align:start position:0%
saying we have 10 members to this
 
05:35:36.670 --> 05:35:36.680 align:start position:0%
commission it would be one from the Dr
 
05:35:38.670 --> 05:35:38.680 align:start position:0%
one from the Controllers Office one from
 
05:35:40.788 --> 05:35:40.798 align:start position:0%
the treasurer's office one from the
 
05:35:43.430 --> 05:35:43.440 align:start position:0%
accounting industry one from the
 
05:35:47.910 --> 05:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
LBA three from the house two from the
 
05:35:50.350 --> 05:35:50.360 align:start position:0%
Senate that equals
 
05:35:54.230 --> 05:35:54.240 align:start position:0%
10 I don't think the LBA feels like it
 
05:35:58.350 --> 05:35:58.360 align:start position:0%
can join that Chris Chris
 
05:36:03.548 --> 05:36:03.558 align:start position:0%
is uh uh Chris Chris uh thank you um
 
05:36:06.230 --> 05:36:06.240 align:start position:0%
representative of bramy and ali um yeah
 
05:36:08.190 --> 05:36:08.200 align:start position:0%
our office would prefer not to be on
 
05:36:11.110 --> 05:36:11.120 align:start position:0%
assigned as a member of a commission
 
05:36:13.230 --> 05:36:13.240 align:start position:0%
however we can work with the commission
 
05:36:14.948 --> 05:36:14.958 align:start position:0%
you know we can come in and testify
 
05:36:17.230 --> 05:36:17.240 align:start position:0%
before the commission and provide
 
05:36:20.310 --> 05:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
comment on um the audit procedures that
 
05:36:22.628 --> 05:36:22.638 align:start position:0%
have been involved with the uh carry
 
05:36:25.708 --> 05:36:25.718 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward um but not be
 
05:36:27.430 --> 05:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
assigned to the commission itself so we
 
05:36:31.150 --> 05:36:31.160 align:start position:0%
could put a statement in a um a bill
 
05:36:32.708 --> 05:36:32.718 align:start position:0%
that basically says you know that that
 
05:36:35.350 --> 05:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
the commission can work with or would
 
05:36:37.390 --> 05:36:37.400 align:start position:0%
have input from the legislative budget
 
05:36:40.150 --> 05:36:40.160 align:start position:0%
assistant but um I don't think we would
 
05:36:41.830 --> 05:36:41.840 align:start position:0%
want to be on a a commission that would
 
05:36:44.070 --> 05:36:44.080 align:start position:0%
eventually lead to some legislation that
 
05:36:45.430 --> 05:36:45.440 align:start position:0%
might lead to something we'd have to
 
05:36:47.070 --> 05:36:47.080 align:start position:0%
audit later
 
05:36:49.830 --> 05:36:49.840 align:start position:0%
on okay then one other idea I'll float
 
05:36:51.590 --> 05:36:51.600 align:start position:0%
out there is from the
 
05:36:54.708 --> 05:36:54.718 align:start position:0%
Bia um perhaps the accounting industry
 
05:36:57.270 --> 05:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
would be a representative somewhat of
 
05:36:59.030 --> 05:36:59.040 align:start position:0%
the private sector but maybe we should
 
05:37:02.150 --> 05:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
hear from Bia as
 
05:37:05.350 --> 05:37:05.360 align:start position:0%
well well you've got the Bia and then
 
05:37:07.910 --> 05:37:07.920 align:start position:0%
you've got the small business realators
 
05:37:10.190 --> 05:37:10.200 align:start position:0%
and the Federation of Independent
 
05:37:13.548 --> 05:37:13.558 align:start position:0%
Business whatever you got three or four
 
05:37:16.628 --> 05:37:16.638 align:start position:0%
different uh industry groups
 
05:37:19.990 --> 05:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
there let's pick one Norm you're back
 
05:37:23.548 --> 05:37:23.558 align:start position:0%
right you wanna Norm you're muted Norm
 
05:37:28.590 --> 05:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:28.600 --> 05:37:30.270 align:start position:0%
 
muted

05:37:30.270 --> 05:37:30.280 align:start position:0%
muted
 
05:37:32.708 --> 05:37:32.718 align:start position:0%
the the viia is probably the most
 
05:37:32.718 --> 05:37:36.390 align:start position:0%
the the viia is probably the most
extensive

05:37:36.390 --> 05:37:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:39.990 --> 05:37:40.000 align:start position:0%
so the B well we're talking about large
 
05:37:43.670 --> 05:37:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:46.990 --> 05:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
appropriate yeah yeah the others are
 
05:37:53.110 --> 05:37:53.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:37:56.670 --> 05:37:56.680 align:start position:0%
businesses okay we got it formulated
 
05:37:58.830 --> 05:37:58.840 align:start position:0%
enough so that we can take a vote and
 
05:37:58.840 --> 05:38:00.548 align:start position:0%
enough so that we can take a vote and
then

05:38:00.548 --> 05:38:00.558 align:start position:0%
then
 
05:38:04.990 --> 05:38:05.000 align:start position:0%
uh we'll work out the details with with
 
05:38:08.628 --> 05:38:08.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:12.548 --> 05:38:12.558 align:start position:0%
Norm uh represent spur Jenny had her
 
05:38:14.350 --> 05:38:14.360 align:start position:0%
hand up but then she took it down she
 
05:38:17.310 --> 05:38:17.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:19.350 --> 05:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
ahead quick question don't have
 
05:38:22.430 --> 05:38:22.440 align:start position:0%
experience with these commissions but uh
 
05:38:24.948 --> 05:38:24.958 align:start position:0%
two points wouldn't it be sensible to
 
05:38:27.548 --> 05:38:27.558 align:start position:0%
have an odd number and second wouldn't
 
05:38:29.510 --> 05:38:29.520 align:start position:0%
the way to be dealing with Bia and
 
05:38:31.830 --> 05:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
Realtors Etc is to have them come before
 
05:38:34.708 --> 05:38:34.718 align:start position:0%
the commission and provide
 
05:38:40.590 --> 05:38:40.600 align:start position:0%
 
05:38:44.070 --> 05:38:44.080 align:start position:0%
right so we were at an odd number before
 
05:38:46.628 --> 05:38:46.638 align:start position:0%
we added the
 
05:38:50.430 --> 05:38:50.440 align:start position:0%
Bia well I I think we should I just to
 
05:38:52.510 --> 05:38:52.520 align:start position:0%
chime in I I agree it should be an odd
 
05:38:54.948 --> 05:38:54.958 align:start position:0%
number and I also agree that we
 
05:38:57.030 --> 05:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
shouldn't specify one of the
 
05:38:58.990 --> 05:38:59.000 align:start position:0%
organizations as the source of a
 
05:38:59.000 --> 05:39:00.030 align:start position:0%
organizations as the source of a
particular

05:39:00.030 --> 05:39:00.040 align:start position:0%
particular
 
05:39:04.750 --> 05:39:04.760 align:start position:0%
of a slot um rather it should be the um
 
05:39:07.990 --> 05:39:08.000 align:start position:0%
if we want somebody uh from the business
 
05:39:11.868 --> 05:39:11.878 align:start position:0%
sector we say so or whatever we we we
 
05:39:11.878 --> 05:39:13.070 align:start position:0%
sector we say so or whatever we we we
Define

05:39:13.070 --> 05:39:13.080 align:start position:0%
Define
 
05:39:17.190 --> 05:39:17.200 align:start position:0%
the the kind of experience that we want
 
05:39:21.110 --> 05:39:21.120 align:start position:0%
the person to bring but not uh the exact
 
05:39:24.910 --> 05:39:24.920 align:start position:0%
Source yeah okay so currently we have 10
 
05:39:26.390 --> 05:39:26.400 align:start position:0%
members to this commission we should
 
05:39:28.390 --> 05:39:28.400 align:start position:0%
either add or delete one so we can come
 
05:39:30.270 --> 05:39:30.280 align:start position:0%
up with that odd number
 
05:39:32.590 --> 05:39:32.600 align:start position:0%
had one
 
05:39:35.788 --> 05:39:35.798 align:start position:0%
representative we had nine before we put
 
05:39:37.948 --> 05:39:37.958 align:start position:0%
in the Bia I thought we were talking
 
05:39:40.230 --> 05:39:40.240 align:start position:0%
about not putting it in all right can
 
05:39:43.590 --> 05:39:43.600 align:start position:0%
can uh can the clerk read the names
 
05:39:46.270 --> 05:39:46.280 align:start position:0%
again sure here's what I have now and I
 
05:39:49.230 --> 05:39:49.240 align:start position:0%
uh one from the Dr one from the
 
05:39:50.788 --> 05:39:50.798 align:start position:0%
controller's office one from the
 
05:39:52.830 --> 05:39:52.840 align:start position:0%
treasurer's office one from the
 
05:39:54.788 --> 05:39:54.798 align:start position:0%
accounting industry one from the
 
05:39:58.150 --> 05:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
business sector two from the house two
 
05:40:00.590 --> 05:40:00.600 align:start position:0%
from the Senate that equal was
 
05:40:02.708 --> 05:40:02.718 align:start position:0%
nine well we don't want two from I think
 
05:40:05.350 --> 05:40:05.360 align:start position:0%
we had more from the house we had three
 
05:40:06.948 --> 05:40:06.958 align:start position:0%
but in an effort to get it to an odd
 
05:40:09.190 --> 05:40:09.200 align:start position:0%
number I reduced it by one so I I'll
 
05:40:12.110 --> 05:40:12.120 align:start position:0%
make it back to three so now we have 10
 
05:40:14.548 --> 05:40:14.558 align:start position:0%
members I thought that we weren't going
 
05:40:17.910 --> 05:40:17.920 align:start position:0%
to put an industry member on it we were
 
05:40:19.270 --> 05:40:19.280 align:start position:0%
just gonna have them
 
05:40:22.150 --> 05:40:22.160 align:start position:0%
come to delete business sector is
 
05:40:23.868 --> 05:40:23.878 align:start position:0%
everyone comfortable with
 
05:40:27.830 --> 05:40:27.840 align:start position:0%
that just the vote how many from the
 
05:40:31.030 --> 05:40:31.040 align:start position:0%
Senate two from the Senate and in par
 
05:40:32.830 --> 05:40:32.840 align:start position:0%
parenthetically I have one from Finance
 
05:40:36.310 --> 05:40:36.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:39.830 --> 05:40:39.840 align:start position:0%
Means in the house I have three members
 
05:40:42.628 --> 05:40:42.638 align:start position:0%
one from Finance two from ways and
 
05:40:45.868 --> 05:40:45.878 align:start position:0%
means our new uh state senator from
 
05:40:51.510 --> 05:40:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:54.948 --> 05:40:54.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:40:57.948 --> 05:40:57.958 align:start position:0%
Auditors do the Auditors are they
 
05:41:01.030 --> 05:41:01.040 align:start position:0%
accountants and they would
 
05:41:02.468 --> 05:41:02.478 align:start position:0%
yes that would be the accounting
 
05:41:04.590 --> 05:41:04.600 align:start position:0%
industry would represent the Auditors
 
05:41:06.070 --> 05:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Association of
 
05:41:08.430 --> 05:41:08.440 align:start position:0%
certified public accountants or some
 
05:41:13.948 --> 05:41:13.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:41:16.628 --> 05:41:16.638 align:start position:0%
you all right so we're we're at nine if
 
05:41:19.670 --> 05:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
everyone's comfortable with
 
05:41:23.270 --> 05:41:23.280 align:start position:0%
that one more time Dr controller
 
05:41:24.990 --> 05:41:25.000 align:start position:0%
Treasurer accounting
 
05:41:27.590 --> 05:41:27.600 align:start position:0%
industry three from the house two from
 
05:41:30.190 --> 05:41:30.200 align:start position:0%
the Senate equals n
 
05:41:33.628 --> 05:41:33.638 align:start position:0%
yeah fine if it's true that the Senate
 
05:41:36.030 --> 05:41:36.040 align:start position:0%
typically only is going to appoint one
 
05:41:38.590 --> 05:41:38.600 align:start position:0%
we'll be back to an even number
 
05:41:40.670 --> 05:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
again I'd rather just appoint one
 
05:41:44.750 --> 05:41:44.760 align:start position:0%
Senator and make it make it three house
 
05:41:47.910 --> 05:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
members okay that brings us down to
 
05:41:51.510 --> 05:41:51.520 align:start position:0%
eight no to make add another house
 
05:41:53.510 --> 05:41:53.520 align:start position:0%
member that would make it four house
 
05:41:56.110 --> 05:41:56.120 align:start position:0%
members and one Senator right bringing
 
05:41:58.628 --> 05:41:58.638 align:start position:0%
the total to nine that's fine that's
 
05:42:01.750 --> 05:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
good okay we beat this
 
05:42:04.750 --> 05:42:04.760 align:start position:0%
thing let's move on we have a great way
 
05:42:08.110 --> 05:42:08.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:11.390 --> 05:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
yes what else do we have to do
 
05:42:15.430 --> 05:42:15.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:20.270 --> 05:42:20.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:42:24.190 --> 05:42:24.200 align:start position:0%
okay then we need the technical language
 
05:42:28.150 --> 05:42:28.160 align:start position:0%
done from Dr I think
 
05:42:30.830 --> 05:42:30.840 align:start position:0%
yeah we can vote the
 
05:42:35.070 --> 05:42:35.080 align:start position:0%
concept and then leave it leave it to uh
 
05:42:39.670 --> 05:42:39.680 align:start position:0%
the Dr to come up with the preliminary
 
05:42:42.708 --> 05:42:42.718 align:start position:0%
language get it to us we'll get it to
 
05:42:44.948 --> 05:42:44.958 align:start position:0%
the committee and has to be done right
 
05:42:49.350 --> 05:42:49.360 align:start position:0%
away for comments and and get it
 
05:42:52.390 --> 05:42:52.400 align:start position:0%
back and we're on our
 
05:42:52.400 --> 05:42:54.310 align:start position:0%
back and we're on our
way

05:42:54.310 --> 05:42:54.320 align:start position:0%
way
 
05:42:57.230 --> 05:42:57.240 align:start position:0%
so who wants to make the
 
05:43:00.270 --> 05:43:00.280 align:start position:0%
motion I I made the I made the I thought
 
05:43:02.430 --> 05:43:02.440 align:start position:0%
there's a motion on the floor right now
 
05:43:05.310 --> 05:43:05.320 align:start position:0%
yes there is a motion was made
 
05:43:09.430 --> 05:43:09.440 align:start position:0%
byamy with Amy second right all we're
 
05:43:11.948 --> 05:43:11.958 align:start position:0%
doing is we amended theemotion a motion
 
05:43:14.670 --> 05:43:14.680 align:start position:0%
to uh do what we just did to add the
 
05:43:16.350 --> 05:43:16.360 align:start position:0%
commission and the the makeup of the
 
05:43:19.990 --> 05:43:20.000 align:start position:0%
commission would be added to that motion
 
05:43:23.750 --> 05:43:23.760 align:start position:0%
and effective within 30 days of passing
 
05:43:32.548 --> 05:43:32.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:43:35.830 --> 05:43:35.840 align:start position:0%

yes chairman could I
ask

05:43:38.430 --> 05:43:38.440 align:start position:0%
ask
 
05:43:42.830 --> 05:43:42.840 align:start position:0%
yes if somehow the budget gets delayed
 
05:43:46.310 --> 05:43:46.320 align:start position:0%
again which has been fairly often in the
 
05:43:49.750 --> 05:43:49.760 align:start position:0%
last decade uh to the fall the
 
05:43:52.350 --> 05:43:52.360 align:start position:0%
commission really wouldn't have
 
05:43:54.990 --> 05:43:55.000 align:start position:0%
time we'll cross that bridge when it
 
05:43:56.868 --> 05:43:56.878 align:start position:0%
comes to it if the budget gets delayed
 
05:44:01.350 --> 05:44:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:44:04.670 --> 05:44:04.680 align:start position:0%

people repr nor major we have to vote on
 
05:48:43.830 --> 05:48:43.840 align:start position:0%
the amount of money we think it's going
 
05:48:46.468 --> 05:48:46.478 align:start position:0%
to cost the
 
05:48:51.708 --> 05:48:51.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:48:54.310 --> 05:48:54.320 align:start position:0%
yes just sent out a letter saying it's
 
05:48:57.510 --> 05:48:57.520 align:start position:0%
going to cost us T
 
05:48:57.520 --> 05:49:00.230 align:start position:0%
going to cost us T
much

05:49:00.230 --> 05:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
much
 
05:49:02.150 --> 05:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
okay I would
 
05:49:05.110 --> 05:49:05.120 align:start position:0%
suggest since up to
 
05:49:05.120 --> 05:49:06.948 align:start position:0%
suggest since up to
four

05:49:06.948 --> 05:49:06.958 align:start position:0%
four
 
05:49:12.150 --> 05:49:12.160 align:start position:0%
4938 on 22 in between 802 to
 
05:49:16.070 --> 05:49:16.080 align:start position:0%
14.1 53 how about if we just use the
 
05:49:19.230 --> 05:49:19.240 align:start position:0%
middle of the range on representative
 
05:49:22.830 --> 05:49:22.840 align:start position:0%
major they the Dr was saying that we
 
05:49:24.830 --> 05:49:24.840 align:start position:0%
should be towards the higher
 
05:49:27.510 --> 05:49:27.520 align:start position:0%
end on
 
05:49:30.990 --> 05:49:31.000 align:start position:0%
the and if we I
 
05:49:34.990 --> 05:49:35.000 align:start position:0%
don't I think 15 million for both is a
 
05:49:40.150 --> 05:49:40.160 align:start position:0%
fairly on good guess at this point
 
05:49:44.670 --> 05:49:44.680 align:start position:0%
and if we split it so it was 4 million
 
05:49:48.310 --> 05:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
the first year and and 11 million the
 
05:49:50.590 --> 05:49:50.600 align:start position:0%
second year that would get us to 15
 
05:49:53.070 --> 05:49:53.080 align:start position:0%
million but if someone else has got
 
05:49:53.080 --> 05:49:54.430 align:start position:0%
million but if someone else has got
another

05:49:54.430 --> 05:49:54.440 align:start position:0%
another
 
05:49:57.910 --> 05:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
idea um does that seem reasonable for
 
05:49:57.920 --> 05:50:00.150 align:start position:0%
idea um does that seem reasonable for
the

05:50:00.150 --> 05:50:00.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:50:03.628 --> 05:50:03.638 align:start position:0%
committee okay with that representative
 
05:50:06.628 --> 05:50:06.638 align:start position:0%
major okay you make that a motion
 
05:50:06.638 --> 05:50:08.270 align:start position:0%
major okay you make that a motion
representative

05:50:08.270 --> 05:50:08.280 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:50:12.548 --> 05:50:12.558 align:start position:0%
Aly yes uh I'll make a motion that the
 
05:50:15.430 --> 05:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
credit carry forward uh amendment that
 
05:50:17.270 --> 05:50:17.280 align:start position:0%
we are proposing to the finance
 
05:50:20.468 --> 05:50:20.478 align:start position:0%
committee on would
 
05:50:24.628 --> 05:50:24.638 align:start position:0%
cost um 4 million in
 
05:50:35.948 --> 05:50:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:50:41.230 --> 05:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
that I wonder representative major um if
 
05:50:43.150 --> 05:50:43.160 align:start position:0%
uh what essentially what we're doing is
 
05:50:45.590 --> 05:50:45.600 align:start position:0%
we're proposing an
 
05:50:48.548 --> 05:50:48.558 align:start position:0%
amendment to an existing
 
05:50:50.788 --> 05:50:50.798 align:start position:0%
provision that has an even greater
 
05:50:50.798 --> 05:50:52.150 align:start position:0%
provision that has an even greater
negative

05:50:52.150 --> 05:50:52.160 align:start position:0%
negative
 
05:50:57.350 --> 05:50:57.360 align:start position:0%
impact yes so I'm wondering if the
 
05:50:57.360 --> 05:50:58.868 align:start position:0%
impact yes so I'm wondering if the
um

05:50:58.868 --> 05:50:58.878 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:51:01.948 --> 05:51:01.958 align:start position:0%
if it should the representation of what
 
05:51:05.350 --> 05:51:05.360 align:start position:0%
this amendment does is that reducing the
 
05:51:09.750 --> 05:51:09.760 align:start position:0%
negative impact the financial impact of
 
05:51:11.788 --> 05:51:11.798 align:start position:0%
the existing
 
05:51:15.750 --> 05:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
provision section such and such of the
 
05:51:19.190 --> 05:51:19.200 align:start position:0%
hb2 from and then we'd have to have a
 
05:51:22.190 --> 05:51:22.200 align:start position:0%
number or from a rounded and estimated
 
05:51:24.910 --> 05:51:24.920 align:start position:0%
number to these numbers that have just
 
05:51:27.468 --> 05:51:27.478 align:start position:0%
been mentioned I think that context is
 
05:51:29.670 --> 05:51:29.680 align:start position:0%
rather important in terms
 
05:51:31.590 --> 05:51:31.600 align:start position:0%
of that would
 
05:51:31.600 --> 05:51:34.150 align:start position:0%
of that would
be

05:51:34.150 --> 05:51:34.160 align:start position:0%
be
 
05:51:34.160 --> 05:51:37.390 align:start position:0%
be
Chris

05:51:37.390 --> 05:51:37.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:51:40.990 --> 05:51:41.000 align:start position:0%
yes with these two numbers you
 
05:51:43.230 --> 05:51:43.240 align:start position:0%
could get an
 
05:51:47.390 --> 05:51:47.400 align:start position:0%
amendment that accomplishes this
 
05:51:50.150 --> 05:51:50.160 align:start position:0%
right so I can I can get an amendment
 
05:51:52.830 --> 05:51:52.840 align:start position:0%
that um sets up the commission that
 
05:51:56.468 --> 05:51:56.478 align:start position:0%
you're talking about and changes which
 
05:51:58.070 --> 05:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
um in House Bill two as it relates to
 
05:52:00.150 --> 05:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
the the carry credit to meet what you've
 
05:52:02.670 --> 05:52:02.680 align:start position:0%
just voted on and I'd work with Dr to
 
05:52:06.150 --> 05:52:06.160 align:start position:0%
get that language um in terms of the
 
05:52:08.750 --> 05:52:08.760 align:start position:0%
value you just want to make a statement
 
05:52:11.830 --> 05:52:11.840 align:start position:0%
um to the finance committee as to the
 
05:52:14.948 --> 05:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
cost of your Amendment right and I think
 
05:52:17.670 --> 05:52:17.680 align:start position:0%
what rep am is asking or suggesting is
 
05:52:20.510 --> 05:52:20.520 align:start position:0%
that you should let let the finance team
 
05:52:22.110 --> 05:52:22.120 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be talking to know
 
05:52:24.830 --> 05:52:24.840 align:start position:0%
that instead of an impact of say $40
 
05:52:27.590 --> 05:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
million it's now going to be only $15
 
05:52:27.600 --> 05:52:30.750 align:start position:0%
million it's now going to be only $15
million

05:52:30.750 --> 05:52:30.760 align:start position:0%
 
05:52:33.510 --> 05:52:33.520 align:start position:0%
exactly so we wouldn't have to divide it
 
05:52:36.230 --> 05:52:36.240 align:start position:0%
by the year you don't necessarily
 
05:52:38.150 --> 05:52:38.160 align:start position:0%
because you did that with me right now I
 
05:52:40.830 --> 05:52:40.840 align:start position:0%
mean when represent major and talks with
 
05:52:42.750 --> 05:52:42.760 align:start position:0%
the represent wer for instance he would
 
05:52:46.390 --> 05:52:46.400 align:start position:0%
want to say we expect four million in 22
 
05:52:48.350 --> 05:52:48.360 align:start position:0%
and 11 million in
 
05:52:51.590 --> 05:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
23 um just to get that statement but I I
 
05:52:53.230 --> 05:52:53.240 align:start position:0%
know that's the intent of ways and means
 
05:52:55.830 --> 05:52:55.840 align:start position:0%
and I would convey that to Mike Kane to
 
05:52:58.708 --> 05:52:58.718 align:start position:0%
include that on the Surplus in that way
 
05:52:58.718 --> 05:53:00.310 align:start position:0%
include that on the Surplus in that way
oh

05:53:00.310 --> 05:53:00.320 align:start position:0%
oh
 
05:53:03.230 --> 05:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
okay but in terms of the amendment um we
 
05:53:05.868 --> 05:53:05.878 align:start position:0%
we would just get an amendment to
 
05:53:07.990 --> 05:53:08.000 align:start position:0%
replace those sections in house bill to
 
05:53:10.030 --> 05:53:10.040 align:start position:0%
I would would put it in your name rep of
 
05:53:13.270 --> 05:53:13.280 align:start position:0%
major to start with um get get it back
 
05:53:15.788 --> 05:53:15.798 align:start position:0%
to you to distribute to the committee to
 
05:53:18.990 --> 05:53:19.000 align:start position:0%
make sure they're okay with it um and
 
05:53:21.270 --> 05:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
then once you guys all are okay we would
 
05:53:23.750 --> 05:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
um then forward it over to um house
 
05:53:25.468 --> 05:53:25.478 align:start position:0%
finance and let them know that this is
 
05:53:28.270 --> 05:53:28.280 align:start position:0%
what wayin means is recommending replace
 
05:53:30.910 --> 05:53:30.920 align:start position:0%
sections uh 102 through
 
05:53:30.920 --> 05:53:33.150 align:start position:0%
sections uh 102 through
105

05:53:33.150 --> 05:53:33.160 align:start position:0%
105
 
05:53:35.628 --> 05:53:35.638 align:start position:0%
okay I think the motion that we're we're
 
05:53:38.670 --> 05:53:38.680 align:start position:0%
talking about here now is really to add
 
05:53:40.670 --> 05:53:40.680 align:start position:0%
change the numbers on line 10 of the
 
05:53:42.910 --> 05:53:42.920 align:start position:0%
change in revenues due to legislative
 
05:53:42.920 --> 05:53:45.390 align:start position:0%
change in revenues due to legislative
changes

05:53:45.390 --> 05:53:45.400 align:start position:0%
changes
 
05:53:47.788 --> 05:53:47.798 align:start position:0%
report we're changing the
 
05:53:51.510 --> 05:53:51.520 align:start position:0%
numbers from the 15 million down to 4
 
05:53:55.468 --> 05:53:55.478 align:start position:0%
million and the 39.8 million down to the
 
05:53:55.478 --> 05:53:57.070 align:start position:0%
million and the 39.8 million down to the
11

05:53:57.070 --> 05:53:57.080 align:start position:0%
11
 
05:53:57.080 --> 05:53:58.868 align:start position:0%
11
million

05:53:58.868 --> 05:53:58.878 align:start position:0%
million
 
05:54:02.990 --> 05:54:03.000 align:start position:0%
that that's what we're voting right
 
05:54:03.000 --> 05:54:03.868 align:start position:0%
that that's what we're voting right
that's

05:54:03.868 --> 05:54:03.878 align:start position:0%
that's
 
05:54:07.110 --> 05:54:07.120 align:start position:0%
perfect any other questions on that uh
 
05:54:10.708 --> 05:54:10.718 align:start position:0%
representative YY you have your hand yes
 
05:54:13.590 --> 05:54:13.600 align:start position:0%
thank you um um Mr
 
05:54:16.708 --> 05:54:16.718 align:start position:0%
chair the question is if I'm trying to
 
05:54:19.548 --> 05:54:19.558 align:start position:0%
remember in the past have we included
 
05:54:23.708 --> 05:54:23.718 align:start position:0%
the CC or Co your credit carry over have
 
05:54:27.070 --> 05:54:27.080 align:start position:0%
we included that as on the revenue side
 
05:54:29.708 --> 05:54:29.718 align:start position:0%
or if we ignore it in the past and if
 
05:54:31.750 --> 05:54:31.760 align:start position:0%
we've ignored it in the past then
 
05:54:34.590 --> 05:54:34.600 align:start position:0%
there's no fiscal impact but if we've
 
05:54:37.830 --> 05:54:37.840 align:start position:0%
included it as Revenue than there is I'm
 
05:54:40.868 --> 05:54:40.878 align:start position:0%
could you refresh my memory on that
 
05:54:43.590 --> 05:54:43.600 align:start position:0%
that's the problem that's been put in as
 
05:54:46.070 --> 05:54:46.080 align:start position:0%
Revenue oh well hell then we have to
 
05:54:48.708 --> 05:54:48.718 align:start position:0%
tell it yeah all right thank
 
05:54:52.788 --> 05:54:52.798 align:start position:0%
you I forgot that thank
 
05:54:55.548 --> 05:54:55.558 align:start position:0%
you there's a lot of money out
 
05:54:59.830 --> 05:54:59.840 align:start position:0%
there liability um so are we
 
05:55:02.468 --> 05:55:02.478 align:start position:0%
clear representative spillsbury
 
05:55:06.510 --> 05:55:06.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman um I get that
 
05:55:09.708 --> 05:55:09.718 align:start position:0%
we're proposing to change to minus four
 
05:55:09.718 --> 05:55:11.670 align:start position:0%
we're proposing to change to minus four
andus

05:55:11.670 --> 05:55:11.680 align:start position:0%
andus
 
05:55:15.310 --> 05:55:15.320 align:start position:0%
11 don't we have an obligation to report
 
05:55:17.430 --> 05:55:17.440 align:start position:0%
to the finance committee the fiscal
 
05:55:18.628 --> 05:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
impact of
 
05:55:22.030 --> 05:55:22.040 align:start position:0%
hb2 as it's written and therefore aren't
 
05:55:24.150 --> 05:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
we going to have to provide
 
05:55:28.190 --> 05:55:28.200 align:start position:0%
the5 and thega 39.8 as well and show
 
05:55:33.270 --> 05:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:38.510 --> 05:55:38.520 align:start position:0%
scenarios I will give them a copy of of
 
05:55:42.110 --> 05:55:42.120 align:start position:0%
what Melissa what the Dr gave us which
 
05:55:42.120 --> 05:55:45.430 align:start position:0%
what Melissa what the Dr gave us which
shows

05:55:45.430 --> 05:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:55:47.868 --> 05:55:47.878 align:start position:0%
that so they're going to see the 15 and
 
05:55:50.708 --> 05:55:50.718 align:start position:0%
the 39.8 figures as
 
05:55:54.150 --> 05:55:54.160 align:start position:0%
well what they're going to see is on
 
05:55:56.910 --> 05:55:56.920 align:start position:0%
chck on page
 
05:56:01.830 --> 05:56:01.840 align:start position:0%
three what this scenario does in
 
05:56:07.670 --> 05:56:07.680 align:start position:0%
2022 it could be anywhere from 0 to 49
 
05:56:07.680 --> 05:56:09.548 align:start position:0%
2022 it could be anywhere from 0 to 49
million

05:56:09.548 --> 05:56:09.558 align:start position:0%
million
 
05:56:12.310 --> 05:56:12.320 align:start position:0%
where we're estimating it's going to be
 
05:56:15.190 --> 05:56:15.200 align:start position:0%
minus four and the second year they're
 
05:56:16.468 --> 05:56:16.478 align:start position:0%
going to see
 
05:56:19.948 --> 05:56:19.958 align:start position:0%
82,000 to 14 million and we're going to
 
05:56:24.190 --> 05:56:24.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:26.110 --> 05:56:26.120 align:start position:0%
11 Mr
 
05:56:29.390 --> 05:56:29.400 align:start position:0%
chairman yes I think that they also need
 
05:56:33.750 --> 05:56:33.760 align:start position:0%
to see uh the bottom of page one which
 
05:56:37.708 --> 05:56:37.718 align:start position:0%
is the the possible cost of each year
 
05:56:40.270 --> 05:56:40.280 align:start position:0%
under what is now in
 
05:56:42.750 --> 05:56:42.760 align:start position:0%
hb2 we're going to get the
 
05:56:42.760 --> 05:56:46.030 align:start position:0%
hb2 we're going to get the
works

05:56:46.030 --> 05:56:46.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:48.270 --> 05:56:48.280 align:start position:0%
good representative Smith has her hand
 
05:56:50.910 --> 05:56:50.920 align:start position:0%
up I'll go over with them I'll have
 
05:56:55.110 --> 05:56:55.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:56:59.590 --> 05:56:59.600 align:start position:0%
me anything else before we vote on it
 
05:57:02.430 --> 05:57:02.440 align:start position:0%
representative Smith has her hand up nor
 
05:57:02.440 --> 05:57:03.510 align:start position:0%
representative Smith has her hand up nor
representative

05:57:03.510 --> 05:57:03.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
05:57:05.990 --> 05:57:06.000 align:start position:0%
Smith thank you Mr chair I just want to
 
05:57:08.150 --> 05:57:08.160 align:start position:0%
point out that I think this is why we
 
05:57:11.830 --> 05:57:11.840 align:start position:0%
pay the LBA all those big bucks that
 
05:57:14.670 --> 05:57:14.680 align:start position:0%
their obligation is to
 
05:57:17.708 --> 05:57:17.718 align:start position:0%
explain um in the probably in the
 
05:57:20.270 --> 05:57:20.280 align:start position:0%
Surplus statement but maybe elsewhere
 
05:57:22.510 --> 05:57:22.520 align:start position:0%
about the difference between what is in
 
05:57:26.430 --> 05:57:26.440 align:start position:0%
fact in house bill one and two now and
 
05:57:30.350 --> 05:57:30.360 align:start position:0%
how this will make make changes um and
 
05:57:32.110 --> 05:57:32.120 align:start position:0%
because it has to go in a number of
 
05:57:34.230 --> 05:57:34.240 align:start position:0%
different places both in the language in
 
05:57:37.230 --> 05:57:37.240 align:start position:0%
house buil to and then in the in the
 
05:57:37.240 --> 05:57:40.190 align:start position:0%
house buil to and then in the in the
revenue

05:57:40.190 --> 05:57:40.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:57:44.070 --> 05:57:44.080 align:start position:0%
estimates thank you representative
 
05:57:47.910 --> 05:57:47.920 align:start position:0%
Smith no I have one more thing um
 
05:57:49.270 --> 05:57:49.280 align:start position:0%
because we're voting for what's going to
 
05:57:51.430 --> 05:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
appear in this change in revenues due to
 
05:57:54.350 --> 05:57:54.360 align:start position:0%
legisa of changes
 
05:57:58.110 --> 05:57:58.120 align:start position:0%
report the title the item is stated as
 
05:58:00.150 --> 05:58:00.160 align:start position:0%
now as business profits tax credit carry
 
05:58:04.350 --> 05:58:04.360 align:start position:0%
forward limited to 50% of total tax
 
05:58:06.468 --> 05:58:06.478 align:start position:0%
liability we may want to we can still
 
05:58:08.548 --> 05:58:08.558 align:start position:0%
use that but but as amended we may have
 
05:58:11.150 --> 05:58:11.160 align:start position:0%
to put as amended in there for the new
 
05:58:14.150 --> 05:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
numbers yes good
 
05:58:16.910 --> 05:58:16.920 align:start position:0%
catch Patrick where where's the
 
05:58:19.350 --> 05:58:19.360 align:start position:0%
reference in the in the report that that
 
05:58:21.070 --> 05:58:21.080 align:start position:0%
we went over earlier today the change in
 
05:58:23.750 --> 05:58:23.760 align:start position:0%
revenues due to legislative changes
 
05:58:26.190 --> 05:58:26.200 align:start position:0%
report yeah that we talked through then
 
05:58:29.468 --> 05:58:29.478 align:start position:0%
we we we vote on but that one line uh
 
05:58:32.390 --> 05:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
business pro okay okay got it all I'm
 
05:58:34.390 --> 05:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
suggesting is we say as amended if we
 
05:58:36.190 --> 05:58:36.200 align:start position:0%
put the new numbers in the minus four
 
05:58:36.200 --> 05:58:37.468 align:start position:0%
put the new numbers in the minus four
and

05:58:37.468 --> 05:58:37.478 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:58:41.230 --> 05:58:41.240 align:start position:0%
minus1 and LBA will have their own
 
05:58:45.510 --> 05:58:45.520 align:start position:0%
format when they put this yeah yeah I
 
05:58:50.430 --> 05:58:50.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:58:55.110 --> 05:58:55.120 align:start position:0%
think so are we ready to vote on
 
05:58:58.708 --> 05:58:58.718 align:start position:0%
line 10 which is the business profits
 
05:59:01.270 --> 05:59:01.280 align:start position:0%
tax Car Credit carry
 
05:59:05.190 --> 05:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
forward we changed it to minus four
 
05:59:09.788 --> 05:59:09.798 align:start position:0%
for fy22 and minus 11 million for FY
 
05:59:14.390 --> 05:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
23 and then where it says limited to 50%
 
05:59:18.810 --> 05:59:18.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:59:18.820 --> 05:59:22.948 align:start position:0%
