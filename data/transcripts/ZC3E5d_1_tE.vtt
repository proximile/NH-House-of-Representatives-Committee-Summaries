entirely sure the timing of when I'll be
 
00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 align:start position:0%

just let us know the page number we'll
 
00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 align:start position:0%
be starting from that would be helpful
 
00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 align:start position:0%
and at this point all members of
 
00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 align:start position:0%
division three should have in their

division of long-term supports and
 
00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:29.639 align:start position:0%

Bureau Chiefs
 
00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 align:start position:0%

Leonard our finance director is here as
well

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:54.840 align:start position:0%
so our goals obviously to move through
 
00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 align:start position:0%
the budgets and to give you kind of a
 
00:05:59.450 --> 00:05:59.460 align:start position:0%
high level overview of the division with
 
00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
the opportunity to pause and ask any
 
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 align:start position:0%
questions so if you turn to slide two
 
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.000 align:start position:0%
this is really just our overall mission
 
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:12.000 align:start position:0%
for the bureau so the division works
 
00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 align:start position:0%
collaboratively with providers and
 
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:17.639 align:start position:0%
communities to support children adults
 
00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 align:start position:0%
and Families
 
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
to be as independent as desired
 
00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 align:start position:0%
throughout the lifespan so as I move
 
00:06:25.249 --> 00:06:25.259 align:start position:0%
through this presentation you'll notice
 
00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:27.600 align:start position:0%
that we provide supports and services
 
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:30.240 align:start position:0%
for children youth with special health
 
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 align:start position:0%
care or complex medical needs adults
 
00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 align:start position:0%
with developmental disabilities and
 
00:06:37.969 --> 00:06:37.979 align:start position:0%
acquired brain disorders and supports
 
00:06:39.529 --> 00:06:39.539 align:start position:0%
and services for the Aging and
 
00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:42.300 align:start position:0%
physically disabled population so we
 
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 align:start position:0%
kind of cover from birth to aging
 
00:06:50.629 --> 00:06:50.639 align:start position:0%
uh slide three it's just again a brief
 
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 align:start position:0%
overview of the division we have three
 
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.600 align:start position:0%
bureaus so the Bureau of elderly and
 
00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 align:start position:0%
Adult Services
 
00:06:58.249 --> 00:06:58.259 align:start position:0%
which provides comprehensive and
 
00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 align:start position:0%
coordinated services for older adults
 
00:07:02.629 --> 00:07:02.639 align:start position:0%
ages 60 and older and adults with
 
00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:05.160 align:start position:0%
disabilities between the ages of 18 and
 
00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:07.370 align:start position:0%
disabilities between the ages of 18 and
59.

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:07.380 align:start position:0%
59.
 
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.600 align:start position:0%
we also have the Bureau of family
 
00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819 align:start position:0%
centered Services which identifies and
 
00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:13.380 align:start position:0%
coordinates supports that assist
 
00:07:16.249 --> 00:07:16.259 align:start position:0%
children from birth to 21 years of age
 
00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.020 align:start position:0%
who have are at risk for a chronic
 
00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:21.780 align:start position:0%
medical condition disability or a
 
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.400 align:start position:0%
special Health Care need
 
00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:25.259 align:start position:0%
and then finally we have the Bureau of
 
00:07:27.830 --> 00:07:27.840 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services which partners
 
00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:30.199 align:start position:0%
with provider organizations to deliver
 
00:07:32.029 --> 00:07:32.039 align:start position:0%
community-based supports and services
 
00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:34.259 align:start position:0%
for adults and children with
 
00:07:36.170 --> 00:07:36.180 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities and acquired
 
00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:43.740 align:start position:0%
um slide number four is just a quick uh
 
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
org chart high level org chart of the
 
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:49.510 align:start position:0%
org chart high level org chart of the
division

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:49.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:54.060 align:start position:0%
Slide Five reviews the overall positions
 
00:07:56.390 --> 00:07:56.400 align:start position:0%
for each of the bureaus within the
 
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:58.080 align:start position:0%
department of long-term supports and
 
00:07:58.080 --> 00:07:59.210 align:start position:0%
department of long-term supports and
services

00:07:59.210 --> 00:07:59.220 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:08:01.129 --> 00:08:01.139 align:start position:0%
so you'll note
 
00:08:03.770 --> 00:08:03.780 align:start position:0%
um a higher number of overall positions
 
00:08:05.270 --> 00:08:05.280 align:start position:0%
in the Bureau of elderly and Adult
 
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:08.520 align:start position:0%
Services and this number includes 70
 
00:08:11.089 --> 00:08:11.099 align:start position:0%
positions that we have in Adult
 
00:08:14.089 --> 00:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
Protective Services in that program that
 
00:08:16.670 --> 00:08:16.680 align:start position:0%
operate out of 11 district offices so
 
00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:17.900 align:start position:0%
that's why you see that number
 
00:08:20.089 --> 00:08:20.099 align:start position:0%
significantly more than our other two
 
00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:23.150 align:start position:0%
significantly more than our other two
bureaus

00:08:23.150 --> 00:08:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:25.440 align:start position:0%
on slide six
 
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:27.840 align:start position:0%
I like to briefly highlight some key
 
00:08:31.969 --> 00:08:31.979 align:start position:0%
division outcomes per Bureau and you can
 
00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:36.419 align:start position:0%
see them here I think for the Bureau of
 
00:08:36.419 --> 00:08:37.130 align:start position:0%
see them here I think for the Bureau of
um

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:39.649 --> 00:08:39.659 align:start position:0%
elderly and Adult Services we've really
 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419 align:start position:0%
strengthened our APS program in
 
00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:44.940 align:start position:0%
investing in education for our APS
 
00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:49.140 align:start position:0%
workers and response times to I know
 
00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:51.660 align:start position:0%
during covid there was some lagging and
 
00:08:53.690 --> 00:08:53.700 align:start position:0%
response times due to the workforce in
 
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:56.180 align:start position:0%
the pandemic and so we've really
 
00:08:59.630 --> 00:08:59.640 align:start position:0%
improved our response times to
 
00:09:02.210 --> 00:09:02.220 align:start position:0%
um calls are answered in the same day
 
00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:07.260 align:start position:0%
our registry inquiries are answered I
 
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:09.300 align:start position:0%
think by Statute it's by it's five days
 
00:09:11.449 --> 00:09:11.459 align:start position:0%
but we're averaging one to two days for
 
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.560 align:start position:0%
for a registry check
 
00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:16.440 align:start position:0%
and we've been working through a
 
00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
contract on structured decision making
 
00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:22.860 align:start position:0%
which really helps the aps workers with
 
00:09:26.269 --> 00:09:26.279 align:start position:0%
assessing risk assessing safety and it's
 
00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:27.779 align:start position:0%
a standardized tool so that's something
 
00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:29.940 align:start position:0%
that we're currently doing
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
um in APS
 
00:09:35.389 --> 00:09:35.399 align:start position:0%
um we also want to make sure that we
 
00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519 align:start position:0%
support and promote active and healthy
 
00:09:41.329 --> 00:09:41.339 align:start position:0%

um
 
00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:47.100 align:start position:0%
and and things like strengthening food
 
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:49.260 align:start position:0%
security and social supports for older
 
00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:51.420 align:start position:0%
adults through home delivered meals and
 
00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:53.640 align:start position:0%
congregate meals some other supplemental
 
00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
food programs they were piloting like a
 
00:09:58.610 --> 00:09:58.620 align:start position:0%
grab-and-go uh meal program or a local
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
restaurants would have kind of like a
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
bagged lunch or a bag dinner where
 
00:10:04.490 --> 00:10:04.500 align:start position:0%
people can pick it up
 
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:07.380 align:start position:0%
um but also promoting awareness for for
 
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:10.200 align:start position:0%
programming that we have so
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
um making sure that they understand that
 
00:10:14.449 --> 00:10:14.459 align:start position:0%
they can go to our aging and disability
 
00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:16.200 align:start position:0%
Resource Center also known as service
 
00:10:19.970 --> 00:10:19.980 align:start position:0%
links with our counties to be able to be
 
00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:21.779 align:start position:0%
provided information about what services
 
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:24.420 align:start position:0%
are available either through the state
 
00:10:28.610 --> 00:10:28.620 align:start position:0%
or through Medicare Medicaid also we
 
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:30.360 align:start position:0%
have an Alzheimer's disease and related
 
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:33.540 align:start position:0%
dementia program that provides respite
 
00:10:37.490 --> 00:10:37.500 align:start position:0%
and some self management of chronic care
 
00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.300 align:start position:0%
and diseases so
 
00:10:42.889 --> 00:10:42.899 align:start position:0%
um that's a quick uh overview of the key
 
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
outcomes for beas
 
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:47.700 align:start position:0%

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:51.180 align:start position:0%
uh you know really supporting children
 
00:10:53.269 --> 00:10:53.279 align:start position:0%
and their families with special Health

00:10:57.650 --> 00:10:57.660 align:start position:0%
community-based services within their
 
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:00.300 align:start position:0%

family support
 
00:11:11.269 --> 00:11:11.279 align:start position:0%
for the Bureau of Developmental Services
 
00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
um we want timely delivery of services
 
00:11:15.889 --> 00:11:15.899 align:start position:0%
in the community and develop a service
 
00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:18.240 align:start position:0%
delivery system for all individuals to
 
00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:20.760 align:start position:0%

state to the services that are available
 
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:26.760 align:start position:0%
so we partner with 10 Regional area
 
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.610 align:start position:0%
so we partner with 10 Regional area
agencies

00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
um and they're the community-based
 
00:11:32.509 --> 00:11:32.519 align:start position:0%
provider and communities provider
 
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:34.740 align:start position:0%
Network through the area agencies to
 
00:11:36.769 --> 00:11:36.779 align:start position:0%
deliver service for those who are
 
00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:39.420 align:start position:0%
eligible under statute for developmental
 
00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.930 align:start position:0%
eligible under statute for developmental
services

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:41.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:44.449 --> 00:11:44.459 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
so far from the committee
 
00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.040 align:start position:0%
I think we're in good shape okay
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
moving to slide seven we're talking
 
00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:55.260 align:start position:0%
about some key accomplishments
 
00:11:57.230 --> 00:11:57.240 align:start position:0%
um so I I added a division level
 
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:00.120 align:start position:0%
accomplishment because over the past
 
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
year and a half we've been able to
 
00:12:04.069 --> 00:12:04.079 align:start position:0%
distribute about 25 million dollars in
 
00:12:06.530 --> 00:12:06.540 align:start position:0%
arpa funding to Direct Care Workforce
 
00:12:08.690 --> 00:12:08.700 align:start position:0%
through our community community-based
 
00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:10.980 align:start position:0%
organizations and providers for
 
00:12:13.250 --> 00:12:13.260 align:start position:0%
recruiting retention staff training and
 
00:12:14.569 --> 00:12:14.579 align:start position:0%
case management
 
00:12:16.750 --> 00:12:16.760 align:start position:0%
um so we were able to push that money
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
directly to the providers
 
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:23.160 align:start position:0%
we also are working on the electronic
 
00:12:26.150 --> 00:12:26.160 align:start position:0%
visit verification which is a federal
 
00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:29.100 align:start position:0%
requirement under the century cures act
 
00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:30.769 align:start position:0%
requirement under the century cures act
which

00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:12:30.779 --> 00:12:31.490 align:start position:0%
which
um

00:12:31.490 --> 00:12:31.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:35.449 --> 00:12:35.459 align:start position:0%
we have been out of compliance with
 
00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:38.700 align:start position:0%
um so we have a good a good uh Faith
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
effort extension that we received where
 
00:12:45.410 --> 00:12:45.420 align:start position:0%
we're working with CMS to have
 
00:12:47.509 --> 00:12:47.519 align:start position:0%
implementation of January of next year
 
00:12:50.090 --> 00:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
so we were able to get that good faith
 
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:51.660 align:start position:0%
exemption as we work with our
 
00:12:55.370 --> 00:12:55.380 align:start position:0%
contractors to get the evv technology
 
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:59.030 align:start position:0%
contractors to get the evv technology
started

00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:01.790 --> 00:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
um for the Bureau of um elderly and
 
00:13:03.710 --> 00:13:03.720 align:start position:0%
Adult Services
 
00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
I think again we are talking a lot about
 
00:13:09.230 --> 00:13:09.240 align:start position:0%
the the aps Workforce investment
 
00:13:10.850 --> 00:13:10.860 align:start position:0%
training that I talked about on the
 
00:13:13.009 --> 00:13:13.019 align:start position:0%
previous slide we were also able to
 
00:13:15.290 --> 00:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
renew our choices for Independence
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
waiver which is our 1915 C Medicaid
 
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:21.300 align:start position:0%
waiver for community-based care
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
so we were able to renew that in June or
 
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:27.420 align:start position:0%
June yeah June of 22. and we've also
 
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:30.300 align:start position:0%
secured a Federal grant called Money
 
00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:31.860 align:start position:0%
Follows the person
 
00:13:34.069 --> 00:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
uh which you may have heard called
 
00:13:36.230 --> 00:13:36.240 align:start position:0%
Community passport program we've had the
 
00:13:38.569 --> 00:13:38.579 align:start position:0%
Grant in the past before
 
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:40.680 align:start position:0%
um but really looking at community-based
 
00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:43.680 align:start position:0%
care for individuals
 
00:13:46.129 --> 00:13:46.139 align:start position:0%
um instead of institutionalized care so
 
00:13:48.470 --> 00:13:48.480 align:start position:0%
we received that Grant
 
00:13:52.430 --> 00:13:52.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:54.420 align:start position:0%
for the Bureau of family centered
 
00:13:54.420 --> 00:13:56.569 align:start position:0%
for the Bureau of family centered
services

00:13:56.569 --> 00:13:56.579 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:13:56.579 --> 00:13:57.650 align:start position:0%
services
um

00:13:57.650 --> 00:13:57.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
we were able to look at quality
 
00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:01.740 align:start position:0%
improvement and restructuring of our
 
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:04.500 align:start position:0%
health care coordination so
 
00:14:06.470 --> 00:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
um the the bureau with stakeholder
 
00:14:09.110 --> 00:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
engagement identified opportunities for
 
00:14:10.970 --> 00:14:10.980 align:start position:0%
improvements for children with special
 
00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.320 align:start position:0%
Health Care needs and their families and
 
00:14:15.470 --> 00:14:15.480 align:start position:0%
the bureau adopted national standards of
 
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:18.360 align:start position:0%
care coordination for those children's
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
special Health Care needs via the
 
00:14:22.790 --> 00:14:22.800 align:start position:0%
National Academy for State Health policy
 
00:14:26.930 --> 00:14:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.090 --> 00:14:29.100 align:start position:0%
um this Bureau also has worked really
 
00:14:29.100 --> 00:14:30.350 align:start position:0%
um this Bureau also has worked really
hard

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.360 align:start position:0%
hard
 
00:14:32.870 --> 00:14:32.880 align:start position:0%
um for Workforce internally
 
00:14:34.250 --> 00:14:34.260 align:start position:0%
um I believe
 
00:14:36.889 --> 00:14:36.899 align:start position:0%
um last last budget round we were about
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
a 40 vacancy rate and in in this Bureau
 
00:14:42.410 --> 00:14:42.420 align:start position:0%
and the bureau chief has worked really
 
00:14:43.910 --> 00:14:43.920 align:start position:0%
hard to make sure that we have
 
00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:45.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate Staffing within the bureau
 
00:14:47.569 --> 00:14:47.579 align:start position:0%
and I believe we have just two open
 
00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:49.980 align:start position:0%
positions in that Bureau at this time
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
so a significant
 
00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:55.139 align:start position:0%
focus on the workforce
 
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:57.180 align:start position:0%
just if I could I do have I just want to
 
00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160 align:start position:0%
swing back to that Grant Money Follows
 
00:15:01.009 --> 00:15:01.019 align:start position:0%
the person probably a good time to ask
 
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:03.060 align:start position:0%
we've had discussion about federal
 
00:15:05.629 --> 00:15:05.639 align:start position:0%
grants previous and uh that's very
 
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:07.800 align:start position:0%
onerous sometimes to apply for them and
 
00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:09.660 align:start position:0%
then there's various conditions ranging
 
00:15:12.769 --> 00:15:12.779 align:start position:0%
from maybe a paragraph to multiple Pages
 
00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.180 align:start position:0%
uh could you just tell us the experience
 
00:15:17.150 --> 00:15:17.160 align:start position:0%
of this particular Grant and what
 
00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:19.980 align:start position:0%
particular strings for lack of a better
 
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
word are attached if any sure I think
 
00:15:24.769 --> 00:15:24.779 align:start position:0%
Vince Grant is a little more flexible
 
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:27.180 align:start position:0%
than the previous Money Follows the
 
00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:28.920 align:start position:0%
person Grant
 
00:15:31.790 --> 00:15:31.800 align:start position:0%
um it's a it's up to five years and it's
 
00:15:35.269 --> 00:15:35.279 align:start position:0%
really structured in a couple of
 
00:15:37.910 --> 00:15:37.920 align:start position:0%
different components so
 
00:15:40.670 --> 00:15:40.680 align:start position:0%
previously like I said it was called the
 
00:15:42.230 --> 00:15:42.240 align:start position:0%
community passport program which really
 
00:15:44.030 --> 00:15:44.040 align:start position:0%
had stringent
 
00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.689 align:start position:0%
had stringent
um

00:15:44.689 --> 00:15:44.699 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:15:47.269 --> 00:15:47.279 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements for people who
 
00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:49.260 align:start position:0%
are looking to transition out of Nursing
 
00:15:51.050 --> 00:15:51.060 align:start position:0%
Home Care into the community so you had
 
00:15:53.210 --> 00:15:53.220 align:start position:0%
to be in the nursing home X number of
 
00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:54.899 align:start position:0%
months but by the time you're in a
 
00:15:56.389 --> 00:15:56.399 align:start position:0%
nursing home for X number of months you
 
00:15:58.730 --> 00:15:58.740 align:start position:0%
have no housing to go to
 
00:16:01.129 --> 00:16:01.139 align:start position:0%
um so they were able to transition 300
 
00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:03.180 align:start position:0%
individuals in the previous program out
 
00:16:04.790 --> 00:16:04.800 align:start position:0%
of nursing homes back into the community
 
00:16:07.790 --> 00:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
but those restrictions as far as
 
00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
eligibility requirements are lesser in
 
00:16:11.810 --> 00:16:11.820 align:start position:0%
this grant
 
00:16:13.910 --> 00:16:13.920 align:start position:0%
um than they were in previous years
 
00:16:15.949 --> 00:16:15.959 align:start position:0%
and we have some time I believe it's a
 
00:16:18.829 --> 00:16:18.839 align:start position:0%
16 month stakeholder engagement process
 
00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:21.480 align:start position:0%
where Wendy Altman the bureau chief we
 
00:16:23.329 --> 00:16:23.339 align:start position:0%
were able to hire
 
00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:26.339 align:start position:0%
um two positions to facilitate the
 
00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:28.079 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement do the data
 
00:16:28.079 --> 00:16:29.569 align:start position:0%
stakeholder engagement do the data
analytics

00:16:29.569 --> 00:16:29.579 align:start position:0%
analytics
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
um so we're we're excited for this I
 
00:16:33.230 --> 00:16:33.240 align:start position:0%
think we can
 
00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:34.860 align:start position:0%
um have up to five million dollars on
 
00:16:36.590 --> 00:16:36.600 align:start position:0%
this grant so
 
00:16:38.810 --> 00:16:38.820 align:start position:0%
um we really think it'll be able to give
 
00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:40.920 align:start position:0%
us A needs assessment and a gaps
 
00:16:43.069 --> 00:16:43.079 align:start position:0%
analysis that will be able to study
 
00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.180 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services and
 
00:16:48.050 --> 00:16:48.060 align:start position:0%
utilization Trends and current gaps in
 
00:16:50.689 --> 00:16:50.699 align:start position:0%
community-based services
 
00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:54.420 align:start position:0%
and and from a from a budget perspective
 
00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:57.480 align:start position:0%
um it's it's on page 931 of the
 
00:16:59.150 --> 00:16:59.160 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget and and
 
00:17:01.249 --> 00:17:01.259 align:start position:0%
the two positions are backing up even
 
00:17:01.259 --> 00:17:02.329 align:start position:0%
the two positions are backing up even
further

00:17:02.329 --> 00:17:02.339 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:17:04.370 --> 00:17:04.380 align:start position:0%
um this was ex this this grant was
 
00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
initially accepted through fiscal the
 
00:17:07.789 --> 00:17:07.799 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year
 
00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:09.780 align:start position:0%
um the two positions that Melissa was
 
00:17:11.809 --> 00:17:11.819 align:start position:0%
referring to those are in class 59 those
 
00:17:14.449 --> 00:17:14.459 align:start position:0%
are the temporary full-time positions
 
00:17:16.189 --> 00:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
um there's no history in the 23 adjusted
 
00:17:17.689 --> 00:17:17.699 align:start position:0%
authorized just because it was accepted
 
00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:19.620 align:start position:0%
through fiscal this fall
 
00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:21.540 align:start position:0%
um after after the budget process had
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
begun so if if there are any questions
 
00:17:25.850 --> 00:17:25.860 align:start position:0%
on the details I appreciate that because
 
00:17:26.870 --> 00:17:26.880 align:start position:0%
my next question was going to be the
 
00:17:28.429 --> 00:17:28.439 align:start position:0%
location so you're obviously has been
 
00:17:29.990 --> 00:17:30.000 align:start position:0%
with us long enough to know and
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
anticipate these questions
 
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
did you say it pays 931
 
00:17:38.110 --> 00:17:38.120 align:start position:0%
931 yes
 
00:17:41.090 --> 00:17:41.100 align:start position:0%
I don't see any positions you sell zeros
 
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:44.580 align:start position:0%
there or yep so so these are in class 59
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
so they're the temporary full-time so
 
00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:48.900 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget only
 
00:17:50.570 --> 00:17:50.580 align:start position:0%
includes the full-time authorized
 
00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:53.700 align:start position:0%
positions in that count yeah and and so
 
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:55.320 align:start position:0%
I had sent the I'd sent the committee
 
00:17:58.610 --> 00:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
the um the totals for the part-time a
 
00:18:00.110 --> 00:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
temporary and full-time temporary
 
00:18:02.029 --> 00:18:02.039 align:start position:0%
separately just because those those
 
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:04.860 align:start position:0%
aren't captured within the system today
 
00:18:09.590 --> 00:18:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:11.090 --> 00:18:11.100 align:start position:0%
um and then lastly for the Bureau of
 
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:13.200 align:start position:0%
Developmental Services we're moving um
 
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.640 align:start position:0%
in the direction of our federal
 
00:18:16.789 --> 00:18:16.799 align:start position:0%
compliance with our corrective action
 
00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:19.500 align:start position:0%
plan with the centers for Medicare and
 
00:18:21.409 --> 00:18:21.419 align:start position:0%
Medicaid services as it relates to
 
00:18:23.750 --> 00:18:23.760 align:start position:0%
direct billing requirements and
 
00:18:26.390 --> 00:18:26.400 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management I'm sure
 
00:18:28.909 --> 00:18:28.919 align:start position:0%
you might have heard of the BDS systems
 
00:18:30.590 --> 00:18:30.600 align:start position:0%
redesign work that we're doing and
 
00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:32.580 align:start position:0%
that's um that's kind of before the
 
00:18:34.490 --> 00:18:34.500 align:start position:0%
redesign work that we've had this
 
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:38.100 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan since 2017. we've
 
00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
had multiple extensions and so our
 
00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:44.640 align:start position:0%
compliance state for direct billing and
 
00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:47.160 align:start position:0%
conflict-free case management is 7-1 of
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
this year so we're moving toward that
 
00:18:53.150 --> 00:18:53.160 align:start position:0%
representative erf for a question so
 
00:18:54.890 --> 00:18:54.900 align:start position:0%
just to back up to the two temp
 
00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:56.940 align:start position:0%
full-time position or the two
 
00:18:59.570 --> 00:18:59.580 align:start position:0%
yeah 10 full-time positions so is the
 
00:19:03.230 --> 00:19:03.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.730 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:05.470 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:05.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.240 align:start position:0%
the state's process for well they are
 
00:19:11.029 --> 00:19:11.039 align:start position:0%
full-time but but they're they're the
 
00:19:13.850 --> 00:19:13.860 align:start position:0%
class 59 the temporary
 
00:19:16.850 --> 00:19:16.860 align:start position:0%
um there's a process for the state so
 
00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:19.380 align:start position:0%
basically every February last February
 
00:19:21.650 --> 00:19:21.660 align:start position:0%
we actually started the budget process
 
00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:23.640 align:start position:0%
it's for us it's an 18-month long
 
00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.190 align:start position:0%
it's for us it's an 18-month long
Endeavor

00:19:25.190 --> 00:19:25.200 align:start position:0%
Endeavor
 
00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:26.700 align:start position:0%
um and we actually start at that point
 
00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:28.380 align:start position:0%
where we look at positions and we make
 
00:19:30.230 --> 00:19:30.240 align:start position:0%
requests to the governor's office for
 
00:19:32.390 --> 00:19:32.400 align:start position:0%
you've heard some folks say the 9t
 
00:19:34.130 --> 00:19:34.140 align:start position:0%
conversions and that's where we're
 
00:19:36.409 --> 00:19:36.419 align:start position:0%
requesting to convert a full-time
 
00:19:38.450 --> 00:19:38.460 align:start position:0%
temporary position into a full-time
 
00:19:40.789 --> 00:19:40.799 align:start position:0%
authorized position to become part of
 
00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:43.799 align:start position:0%
that total roughly 3 200 Personnel count
 
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:46.740 align:start position:0%
that our department has
 
00:19:48.230 --> 00:19:48.240 align:start position:0%
so you did not do that for these
 
00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.430 align:start position:0%
so you did not do that for these
positions

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:51.660 align:start position:0%
we did not because this item went to
 
00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:53.700 align:start position:0%
fiscal I believe just this past November
 
00:19:56.090 --> 00:19:56.100 align:start position:0%
so so many months after that process had
 
00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.590 align:start position:0%
so so many months after that process had
transpired

00:19:57.590 --> 00:19:57.600 align:start position:0%
transpired
 
00:19:59.029 --> 00:19:59.039 align:start position:0%
is the intention that they become
 
00:19:59.039 --> 00:20:00.529 align:start position:0%
is the intention that they become
full-time

00:20:00.529 --> 00:20:00.539 align:start position:0%
full-time
 
00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:02.760 align:start position:0%
classified full-time this is a five-year
 
00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:04.190 align:start position:0%
classified full-time this is a five-year
Grant

00:20:04.190 --> 00:20:04.200 align:start position:0%
Grant
 
00:20:06.529 --> 00:20:06.539 align:start position:0%
um so I don't at this point in time
 
00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:08.640 align:start position:0%
don't have any intention of having those
 
00:20:10.190 --> 00:20:10.200 align:start position:0%
be full-time permanent authorized
 
00:20:11.870 --> 00:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
positions just because those are funded
 
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:13.260 align:start position:0%
through the Grant and it's a temporary
 
00:20:17.770 --> 00:20:17.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:20.570 --> 00:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
another area I want to touch upon for
 
00:20:24.169 --> 00:20:24.179 align:start position:0%
for the Bureau of Developmental services
 
00:20:26.090 --> 00:20:26.100 align:start position:0%
um is is our systems change work that
 
00:20:28.850 --> 00:20:28.860 align:start position:0%
you might have heard of so we are
 
00:20:31.669 --> 00:20:31.679 align:start position:0%
working on with with throat Contracting
 
00:20:33.590 --> 00:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
with with providers
 
00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:34.430 align:start position:0%
with with providers
um

00:20:34.430 --> 00:20:34.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:37.260 align:start position:0%
developing uh provider Service rates new
 
00:20:40.430 --> 00:20:40.440 align:start position:0%
rates provider education working with
 
00:20:43.850 --> 00:20:43.860 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders on several committees
 
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:45.720 align:start position:0%
um in order to
 
00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:49.260 align:start position:0%
get their input on future state of BDS
 
00:20:50.930 --> 00:20:50.940 align:start position:0%
or the Bureau of Developmental services
 
00:20:53.390 --> 00:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
so it's kind of twofold one is our
 
00:20:56.150 --> 00:20:56.160 align:start position:0%
corrective action plan through CMS that
 
00:20:59.029 --> 00:20:59.039 align:start position:0%
our compliance date is July 1st of this
 
00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:01.799 align:start position:0%
year and then these other systems change
 
00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:04.260 align:start position:0%
work would be after that seven one date
 
00:21:06.950 --> 00:21:06.960 align:start position:0%
but we're already engaging stakeholders
 
00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:08.760 align:start position:0%
and families and providers in the
 
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:10.970 align:start position:0%
and families and providers in the
process

00:21:10.970 --> 00:21:10.980 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:13.080 align:start position:0%
and one thing we're really excited about
 
00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:22.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:25.010 --> 00:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
I just heard you say that you were
 
00:21:27.950 --> 00:21:27.960 align:start position:0%
working on Contracting and
 
00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:29.280 align:start position:0%
um I think you said something about
 
00:21:33.789 --> 00:21:33.799 align:start position:0%
adjusting rates so in this area are they
 
00:21:36.470 --> 00:21:36.480 align:start position:0%
receiving the three percent rate
 
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:38.220 align:start position:0%
increase or are you are there other
 
00:21:41.029 --> 00:21:41.039 align:start position:0%
rates that are being suggested for this
 
00:21:41.039 --> 00:21:42.409 align:start position:0%
rates that are being suggested for this
group

00:21:42.409 --> 00:21:42.419 align:start position:0%
group
 
00:21:46.310 --> 00:21:46.320 align:start position:0%
sure so for for this group um this had
 
00:21:48.049 --> 00:21:48.059 align:start position:0%
come up
 
00:21:51.590 --> 00:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
um excuse me so if you turn to page uh
 
00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:56.470 align:start position:0%
um excuse me so if you turn to page uh
1042

00:21:56.470 --> 00:21:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:59.570 --> 00:21:59.580 align:start position:0%
this is this is where funds funds are
 
00:22:01.669 --> 00:22:01.679 align:start position:0%
are included in the budget and Melissa I
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want me to hold off or
 
00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:05.029 align:start position:0%
don't know if you want me to hold off or
okay

00:22:05.029 --> 00:22:05.039 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:22:07.310 --> 00:22:07.320 align:start position:0%
um so part of part of the
 
00:22:10.490 --> 00:22:10.500 align:start position:0%
transformational work that that Melissa
 
00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:13.679 align:start position:0%
has has been leading with her team is
 
00:22:16.909 --> 00:22:16.919 align:start position:0%
ensuring that that we are compliant with
 
00:22:19.549 --> 00:22:19.559 align:start position:0%
with a variety of federal regulations
 
00:22:22.130 --> 00:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
um but but what they've done you'll see
 
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:23.760 align:start position:0%
in classline
 
00:22:26.570 --> 00:22:26.580 align:start position:0%
um if you if you look at classline 103
 
00:22:29.210 --> 00:22:29.220 align:start position:0%
contracts for Op Services that
 
00:22:31.310 --> 00:22:31.320 align:start position:0%
represents the dad's rate or the
 
00:22:33.409 --> 00:22:33.419 align:start position:0%
administrative rate
 
00:22:35.690 --> 00:22:35.700 align:start position:0%
um that the area agencies will will be
 
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
claiming and basically because we've
 
00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:40.740 align:start position:0%
been given funds for that and that that
 
00:22:42.529 --> 00:22:42.539 align:start position:0%
and that rate we have to budget that
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
rate separately
 
00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:46.450 align:start position:0%
rate separately
um

00:22:46.450 --> 00:22:46.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:22:49.789 --> 00:22:49.799 align:start position:0%
those numbers there will allow us to
 
00:22:51.529 --> 00:22:51.539 align:start position:0%
provide a three percent service rate
 
00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.000 align:start position:0%
increase to the existing services today
 
00:22:56.870 --> 00:22:56.880 align:start position:0%
because we were funded at the 15 million
 
00:22:59.570 --> 00:22:59.580 align:start position:0%
dollar for the dad's rate
 
00:23:02.210 --> 00:23:02.220 align:start position:0%
so so because of that we have sufficient
 
00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:04.740 align:start position:0%
funds within the class 502 for that
 
00:23:10.909 --> 00:23:10.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:15.529 --> 00:23:15.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:17.630 --> 00:23:17.640 align:start position:0%
and then last but not least excuse me
 
00:23:20.090 --> 00:23:20.100 align:start position:0%
once more representative Stringham for a
 
00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:21.010 align:start position:0%
once more representative Stringham for a
question

00:23:21.010 --> 00:23:21.020 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:25.080 align:start position:0%
since since we're on uh 10 10 42 so
 
00:23:27.289 --> 00:23:27.299 align:start position:0%
we're we're seeing a pretty you know
 
00:23:30.610 --> 00:23:30.620 align:start position:0%
significant rise in payment to Providers
 
00:23:33.770 --> 00:23:33.780 align:start position:0%
uh above three percent so that would
 
00:23:35.090 --> 00:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
seem to indicate that you got an
 
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:37.620 align:start position:0%
increased volume of those of either
 
00:23:40.750 --> 00:23:40.760 align:start position:0%
Services service intensity or number of
 
00:23:44.510 --> 00:23:44.520 align:start position:0%
individuals receiving Services
 
00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:46.740 align:start position:0%
um can you talk about that at all yeah I
 
00:23:48.649 --> 00:23:48.659 align:start position:0%
would say it's a variety of those right
 
00:23:50.510 --> 00:23:50.520 align:start position:0%
so we haven't
 
00:23:54.590 --> 00:23:54.600 align:start position:0%
um updated our rates really since 20
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
seven oh seven yeah 2007 for providers
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
for folks um providing services for DD
 
00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:03.600 align:start position:0%
so some of that increase takes that into
 
00:24:03.600 --> 00:24:05.330 align:start position:0%
so some of that increase takes that into
consideration

00:24:05.330 --> 00:24:05.340 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:07.080 align:start position:0%
um we're also seeing you know the cost
 
00:24:10.850 --> 00:24:10.860 align:start position:0%
of services going up from providers and
 
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:14.340 align:start position:0%
the cost to retain and recruit direct
 
00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:16.740 align:start position:0%
service Professionals in order to do the
 
00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:19.620 align:start position:0%
work which is where we see some of that
 
00:24:22.010 --> 00:24:22.020 align:start position:0%
going can I just follow up first is that
 
00:24:22.970 --> 00:24:22.980 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:24:24.770 --> 00:24:24.780 align:start position:0%
um so can you comment on what the wait
 
00:24:28.190 --> 00:24:28.200 align:start position:0%
list is now and for those currently in
 
00:24:30.169 --> 00:24:30.179 align:start position:0%
the system to what degree they're having
 
00:24:30.179 --> 00:24:31.970 align:start position:0%
the system to what degree they're having
success

00:24:31.970 --> 00:24:31.980 align:start position:0%
success
 
00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
uh having those Services provided at the
 
00:24:37.310 --> 00:24:37.320 align:start position:0%
current current rates sure so I can
 
00:24:39.049 --> 00:24:39.059 align:start position:0%
speak to
 
00:24:41.630 --> 00:24:41.640 align:start position:0%
as of last month
 
00:24:44.149 --> 00:24:44.159 align:start position:0%
um we don't have and I want to kind of
 
00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:46.140 align:start position:0%
differentiate we have nobody on the wait
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
list for funding everybody
 
00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:51.299 align:start position:0%
um is funded for services through
 
00:24:54.649 --> 00:24:54.659 align:start position:0%
through BDS who are on the wait list
 
00:24:57.770 --> 00:24:57.780 align:start position:0%
however I in in working with the area
 
00:25:01.310 --> 00:25:01.320 align:start position:0%
agencies what we find is that even
 
00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:04.140 align:start position:0%
though they have the funding of some of
 
00:25:05.990 --> 00:25:06.000 align:start position:0%
the people who don't start Services is
 
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:07.980 align:start position:0%
because they can't find staff or
 
00:25:10.850 --> 00:25:10.860 align:start position:0%
providers to provide the service so even
 
00:25:12.230 --> 00:25:12.240 align:start position:0%
though the funding's been approved the
 
00:25:14.930 --> 00:25:14.940 align:start position:0%
budget's been approved for example our
 
00:25:19.490 --> 00:25:19.500 align:start position:0%
latest statistics is that out of the 448
 
00:25:21.049 --> 00:25:21.059 align:start position:0%
folks that we funded on the
 
00:25:23.810 --> 00:25:23.820 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities waiver with a
 
00:25:26.090 --> 00:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
projection of a start date
 
00:25:29.390 --> 00:25:29.400 align:start position:0%
um 65 percent are receiving services and
 
00:25:31.669 --> 00:25:31.679 align:start position:0%
35 percent are not
 
00:25:34.850 --> 00:25:34.860 align:start position:0%
um because of like I said uh lack of
 
00:25:37.130 --> 00:25:37.140 align:start position:0%
providers and staff to provide that
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
funded service
 
00:25:43.010 --> 00:25:43.020 align:start position:0%
so it's a 65 if it's okay I'm 65 are
 
00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:44.460 align:start position:0%
they receiving all of the services
 
00:25:46.669 --> 00:25:46.679 align:start position:0%
they're entitled to or at least some at
 
00:25:48.049 --> 00:25:48.059 align:start position:0%
least some
 
00:25:50.330 --> 00:25:50.340 align:start position:0%
full or partial
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
to all part of my next bullet is our I.T
 
00:25:55.310 --> 00:25:55.320 align:start position:0%
system but we do all this work currently
 
00:25:57.289 --> 00:25:57.299 align:start position:0%
collecting these numbers manually
 
00:25:59.750 --> 00:25:59.760 align:start position:0%
through through BDS and through the area
 
00:26:02.450 --> 00:26:02.460 align:start position:0%
agencies so we're hoping we'll have
 
00:26:04.370 --> 00:26:04.380 align:start position:0%
better and quicker numbers through our
 
00:26:06.529 --> 00:26:06.539 align:start position:0%
new it system to track and be able to
 
00:26:09.590 --> 00:26:09.600 align:start position:0%
trend is somebody getting 100 of their
 
00:26:12.289 --> 00:26:12.299 align:start position:0%
services early early getting 50 of their
 
00:26:12.299 --> 00:26:13.310 align:start position:0%
services early early getting 50 of their
services

00:26:13.310 --> 00:26:13.320 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:26:16.669 --> 00:26:16.679 align:start position:0%
so with this with this increase from 347
 
00:26:21.769 --> 00:26:21.779 align:start position:0%
to 414 and 417 would you expect that 65
 
00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
percent number to go up in the next in
 
00:26:26.210 --> 00:26:26.220 align:start position:0%
this coming biennium to something higher
 
00:26:28.490 --> 00:26:28.500 align:start position:0%
than 65 percent
 
00:26:31.490 --> 00:26:31.500 align:start position:0%
um or or are we treading water at these
 
00:26:33.890 --> 00:26:33.900 align:start position:0%
numbers yeah it's hard to tell I mean I
 
00:26:36.409 --> 00:26:36.419 align:start position:0%
think we we really need to focus on
 
00:26:37.789 --> 00:26:37.799 align:start position:0%
Workforce and I'm sure that's something
 
00:26:39.350 --> 00:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
that you've heard probably throughout
 
00:26:41.930 --> 00:26:41.940 align:start position:0%
everyone's uh presentation they think
 
00:26:44.450 --> 00:26:44.460 align:start position:0%
that's really one of the the biggest
 
00:26:47.029 --> 00:26:47.039 align:start position:0%
barriers in getting services to people
 
00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:49.620 align:start position:0%
is having a Workforce
 
00:26:51.830 --> 00:26:51.840 align:start position:0%
um to be able to provide that part of
 
00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:54.840 align:start position:0%
our service rate development is looking
 
00:26:57.970 --> 00:26:57.980 align:start position:0%
at the direct service professional rate
 
00:27:00.409 --> 00:27:00.419 align:start position:0%
and benefits so that's really the
 
00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.220 align:start position:0%
building block of the new rates that
 
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:04.140 align:start position:0%
we're developing so we're hoping that
 
00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:06.000 align:start position:0%
really makes a difference in enticing
 
00:27:08.510 --> 00:27:08.520 align:start position:0%
folks as we start off
 
00:27:12.409 --> 00:27:12.419 align:start position:0%
um developing rates based on DSP rates
 
00:27:14.450 --> 00:27:14.460 align:start position:0%
thank you go ahead
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
okay representative Wallner for a
 
00:27:20.029 --> 00:27:20.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:22.380 align:start position:0%
so did I just hear you say that you had
 
00:27:26.029 --> 00:27:26.039 align:start position:0%
not increased the rate since 2007.
 
00:27:28.549 --> 00:27:28.559 align:start position:0%
yeah we have not had a rate study since
 
00:27:30.769 --> 00:27:30.779 align:start position:0%
2007 so I believe there's been
 
00:27:30.779 --> 00:27:32.750 align:start position:0%
2007 so I believe there's been
incremental

00:27:32.750 --> 00:27:32.760 align:start position:0%
incremental
 
00:27:35.090 --> 00:27:35.100 align:start position:0%
um like Medicaid across the board rate
 
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:38.520 align:start position:0%
increases but not not a rate study to
 
00:27:41.269 --> 00:27:41.279 align:start position:0%
see if the cost of services
 
00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:42.230 align:start position:0%
see if the cost of services
um

00:27:42.230 --> 00:27:42.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:44.390 --> 00:27:44.400 align:start position:0%
is what the rate provides
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
so one thing I've wondered for a while
 
00:27:48.890 --> 00:27:48.900 align:start position:0%
with all the services is this three
 
00:27:50.690 --> 00:27:50.700 align:start position:0%
percent rate increase
 
00:27:52.730 --> 00:27:52.740 align:start position:0%
and everyone is having Workforce
 
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.070 align:start position:0%
and everyone is having Workforce
problems

00:27:55.070 --> 00:27:55.080 align:start position:0%
problems
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
how realistic is it that a three percent
 
00:28:00.409 --> 00:28:00.419 align:start position:0%
rate increase is actually going to be
 
00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:02.940 align:start position:0%
able to help the area agencies address
 
00:28:05.630 --> 00:28:05.640 align:start position:0%
this shortage of workers which then
 
00:28:07.610 --> 00:28:07.620 align:start position:0%
means that we aren't providing the level
 
00:28:12.649 --> 00:28:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.409 --> 00:28:15.419 align:start position:0%
yeah and I think I think part of that is
 
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:17.880 align:start position:0%
um as we're developing the service
 
00:28:21.890 --> 00:28:21.900 align:start position:0%
provider rates it's not necessarily that
 
00:28:23.690 --> 00:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
three percent we're really looking and
 
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:26.220 align:start position:0%
Gathering costs from providers to
 
00:28:28.610 --> 00:28:28.620 align:start position:0%
develop a base rate that takes into
 
00:28:30.830 --> 00:28:30.840 align:start position:0%
consideration the cost of workers so
 
00:28:33.649 --> 00:28:33.659 align:start position:0%
we're hoping working with the our um
 
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:35.760 align:start position:0%
contractor Myers and staff are there a
 
00:28:38.289 --> 00:28:38.299 align:start position:0%
rate setting entity in an actuary firm
 
00:28:41.029 --> 00:28:41.039 align:start position:0%
that they will get and receive cost
 
00:28:43.789 --> 00:28:43.799 align:start position:0%
reporting data from providers and area
 
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:46.020 align:start position:0%
agencies about how much it costs to
 
00:28:48.289 --> 00:28:48.299 align:start position:0%
provide our specific services and build
 
00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000 align:start position:0%
the rate off of that
 
00:28:53.990 --> 00:28:54.000 align:start position:0%
and when will that be complete
 
00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
well complete um we're hoping let me
 
00:28:59.990 --> 00:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
find my little timeline here
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
um we're starting we started with the
 
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:06.000 align:start position:0%
area agency administrative rate which we
 
00:29:08.690 --> 00:29:08.700 align:start position:0%
um completed this past month and so we
 
00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:11.700 align:start position:0%
are now starting with the the direct
 
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:14.580 align:start position:0%
Service rates so we're hoping to have
 
00:29:17.570 --> 00:29:17.580 align:start position:0%
draft rates by the end of this year
 
00:29:19.970 --> 00:29:19.980 align:start position:0%
to be able to there's some legislation
 
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:22.500 align:start position:0%
going on to Pilot or test those rates to
 
00:29:24.649 --> 00:29:24.659 align:start position:0%
see if they're sufficient so we're
 
00:29:24.659 --> 00:29:25.730 align:start position:0%
see if they're sufficient so we're
working

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:25.740 align:start position:0%
working
 
00:29:27.769 --> 00:29:27.779 align:start position:0%
um with the area agencies and those
 
00:29:29.990 --> 00:29:30.000 align:start position:0%
providers as to what piloting those
 
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.100 align:start position:0%
rates would look like and would that be
 
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:37.740 align:start position:0%
thank you just want to be sure that
 
00:29:39.710 --> 00:29:39.720 align:start position:0%
microphone is picking up everything
 
00:29:41.450 --> 00:29:41.460 align:start position:0%
you're saying for our YouTube audience
 
00:29:46.250 --> 00:29:46.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:49.380 align:start position:0%
I'm probably a little slow here
 
00:29:51.230 --> 00:29:51.240 align:start position:0%
so if I understand what you're saying
 
00:29:53.149 --> 00:29:53.159 align:start position:0%
the lines
 
00:29:56.870 --> 00:29:56.880 align:start position:0%
103 and 502 uh contracts drop services
 
00:29:59.570 --> 00:29:59.580 align:start position:0%
and payment providers The Fairly large
 
00:30:02.389 --> 00:30:02.399 align:start position:0%
increase there in both those lines would
 
00:30:04.669 --> 00:30:04.679 align:start position:0%
be due to rate increases that you're
 
00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:06.720 align:start position:0%
anticipating putting into effect is that
 
00:30:06.720 --> 00:30:07.970 align:start position:0%
anticipating putting into effect is that
correct

00:30:07.970 --> 00:30:07.980 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:11.340 align:start position:0%
no no so I just told you I was slow
 
00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:14.220 align:start position:0%
short and and I I think we we kind of
 
00:30:15.409 --> 00:30:15.419 align:start position:0%
launched into things without without
 
00:30:18.350 --> 00:30:18.360 align:start position:0%
kind of diving into some of the kind of
 
00:30:21.049 --> 00:30:21.059 align:start position:0%
structural basis for it so part of the
 
00:30:22.850 --> 00:30:22.860 align:start position:0%
reason that we're setting up this
 
00:30:24.830 --> 00:30:24.840 align:start position:0%
administrative rate separately is
 
00:30:26.870 --> 00:30:26.880 align:start position:0%
because under Medicaid we we have to
 
00:30:28.610 --> 00:30:28.620 align:start position:0%
track that separately traditionally it
 
00:30:31.310 --> 00:30:31.320 align:start position:0%
was we weren't tracking it separately
 
00:30:35.570 --> 00:30:35.580 align:start position:0%
and so now the the 397 the 345 figures
 
00:30:38.269 --> 00:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
you see there in in the class 502 that
 
00:30:41.870 --> 00:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
will represent the the Medicaid uh
 
00:30:44.870 --> 00:30:44.880 align:start position:0%
provider service figures versus the dads
 
00:30:47.810 --> 00:30:47.820 align:start position:0%
rate which that will be uh paid to the
 
00:30:50.269 --> 00:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
area agencies so it's it's we're
 
00:30:53.149 --> 00:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
separating that out so the 397 there
 
00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:55.260 align:start position:0%
what you see there is you're seeing a
 
00:30:57.529 --> 00:30:57.539 align:start position:0%
projected increase
 
00:31:00.950 --> 00:31:00.960 align:start position:0%
um in in the needs from from from the
 
00:31:03.169 --> 00:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
data that we have available today so we
 
00:31:06.049 --> 00:31:06.059 align:start position:0%
are anticipating an increase
 
00:31:08.389 --> 00:31:08.399 align:start position:0%
um in individuals that that would come
 
00:31:11.210 --> 00:31:11.220 align:start position:0%
into the into the system
 
00:31:14.029 --> 00:31:14.039 align:start position:0%
okay so by the way his dad is an acronym
 
00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
or are you talking about people like me
 
00:31:19.669 --> 00:31:19.679 align:start position:0%
you know it is an acronym um I didn't
 
00:31:21.649 --> 00:31:21.659 align:start position:0%
make it up but it's um the designated
 
00:31:27.169 --> 00:31:27.179 align:start position:0%
Erie agency delivery System rate okay
 
00:31:28.310 --> 00:31:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
00:31:28.320 --> 00:31:29.269 align:start position:0%
that's okay
um

00:31:29.269 --> 00:31:29.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
so back to the
 
00:31:34.190 --> 00:31:34.200 align:start position:0%
103 could just
 
00:31:37.370 --> 00:31:37.380 align:start position:0%
explain that one
 
00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:39.850 align:start position:0%
explain that one
again

00:31:39.850 --> 00:31:39.860 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
it's like
 
00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:55.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:57.950 --> 00:31:57.960 align:start position:0%
uh no okay
 
00:31:57.960 --> 00:32:00.470 align:start position:0%
uh no okay
sure

00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:04.130 --> 00:32:04.140 align:start position:0%
yeah so for the dads rate
 
00:32:06.889 --> 00:32:06.899 align:start position:0%
um let me just turn to my page here
 
00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:10.320 align:start position:0%
we're still on page 1043 in our budget
 
00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.269 align:start position:0%
we're still on page 1043 in our budget
books

00:32:11.269 --> 00:32:11.279 align:start position:0%
books
 
00:32:25.310 --> 00:32:25.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:26.990 --> 00:32:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay so
 
00:32:30.409 --> 00:32:30.419 align:start position:0%
um in developing the stat rate we worked
 
00:32:32.930 --> 00:32:32.940 align:start position:0%
with the area agencies on again
 
00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:35.700 align:start position:0%
collecting their costs
 
00:32:38.149 --> 00:32:38.159 align:start position:0%
um surveys as far as it what does it
 
00:32:41.350 --> 00:32:41.360 align:start position:0%
cost the area agency to provide
 
00:32:44.210 --> 00:32:44.220 align:start position:0%
administrative services not Direct Care
 
00:32:47.210 --> 00:32:47.220 align:start position:0%
Services administrative services to
 
00:32:49.549 --> 00:32:49.559 align:start position:0%
families and individuals who are
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
eligible under 171a for developmental
 
00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:54.310 align:start position:0%
eligible under 171a for developmental
services

00:32:54.310 --> 00:32:54.320 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:32:57.230 --> 00:32:57.240 align:start position:0%
historically that cost has been coming
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
out of and this is where you'll hear
 
00:33:01.010 --> 00:33:01.020 align:start position:0%
about the three percent
 
00:33:03.710 --> 00:33:03.720 align:start position:0%
it comes out of an individual's budget
 
00:33:06.289 --> 00:33:06.299 align:start position:0%
to fund that administrative rate so what
 
00:33:08.570 --> 00:33:08.580 align:start position:0%
we've done is taking those
 
00:33:11.330 --> 00:33:11.340 align:start position:0%
administrative functions came up with a
 
00:33:14.210 --> 00:33:14.220 align:start position:0%
rate that includes intake and
 
00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:16.980 align:start position:0%
eligibility that includes ongoing
 
00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:19.620 align:start position:0%
provision of services on a monthly basis
 
00:33:22.190 --> 00:33:22.200 align:start position:0%
for anyone that is receiving Area Agency
 
00:33:26.509 --> 00:33:26.519 align:start position:0%
services and was able to develop an
 
00:33:27.889 --> 00:33:27.899 align:start position:0%
administrative rate for those
 
00:33:30.169 --> 00:33:30.179 align:start position:0%
administrative costs so when we talk
 
00:33:32.090 --> 00:33:32.100 align:start position:0%
about the three percent going back to
 
00:33:35.330 --> 00:33:35.340 align:start position:0%
the providers since we were able to get
 
00:33:38.570 --> 00:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
a dad's rate for administrative costs
 
00:33:40.850 --> 00:33:40.860 align:start position:0%
we're passing along that three percent
 
00:33:42.710 --> 00:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
that normally would come out of a
 
00:33:45.710 --> 00:33:45.720 align:start position:0%
person's budget back into the budget for
 
00:33:47.810 --> 00:33:47.820 align:start position:0%
providers for services
 
00:33:50.149 --> 00:33:50.159 align:start position:0%
okay just adjust so if I'm clear so
 
00:33:50.159 --> 00:33:51.350 align:start position:0%
okay just adjust so if I'm clear so
previously

00:33:51.350 --> 00:33:51.360 align:start position:0%
previously
 
00:33:53.149 --> 00:33:53.159 align:start position:0%
those 103 numbers would have been
 
00:33:53.159 --> 00:33:54.289 align:start position:0%
those 103 numbers would have been
included

00:33:54.289 --> 00:33:54.299 align:start position:0%
included
 
00:33:56.509 --> 00:33:56.519 align:start position:0%
in the 502 lines basically the same
 
00:33:57.889 --> 00:33:57.899 align:start position:0%
providers are getting the payments it's
 
00:33:59.930 --> 00:33:59.940 align:start position:0%
just just you know tracking it which I
 
00:33:59.940 --> 00:34:00.830 align:start position:0%
just just you know tracking it which I
like

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:00.840 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:34:01.909 --> 00:34:01.919 align:start position:0%
um it's separate the administrative
 
00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
costs from exactly from the actual cost
 
00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:05.640 align:start position:0%
of providing Services yes thank you very
 
00:34:07.789 --> 00:34:07.799 align:start position:0%
much yeah so we do have the we have
 
00:34:10.129 --> 00:34:10.139 align:start position:0%
presented the rates for the dad's
 
00:34:12.649 --> 00:34:12.659 align:start position:0%
administrative costs right now they're
 
00:34:15.829 --> 00:34:15.839 align:start position:0%
with um CMS for approval
 
00:34:17.930 --> 00:34:17.940 align:start position:0%
um and so we should hear from them soon
 
00:34:19.250 --> 00:34:19.260 align:start position:0%
we hope
 
00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020 align:start position:0%
um and then our work now is now pivoting
 
00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.200 align:start position:0%
toward the provider rate
 
00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:27.829 align:start position:0%
toward the provider rate
hmm

00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:30.720 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:34:34.310 --> 00:34:34.320 align:start position:0%
so I think I heard you say that
 
00:34:36.829 --> 00:34:36.839 align:start position:0%
at this point we don't have a wait list
 
00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:40.500 align:start position:0%
because everyone does have a budget
 
00:34:43.190 --> 00:34:43.200 align:start position:0%
yes everyone's been fun to have have a
 
00:34:45.470 --> 00:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
budget but we're only really delivering
 
00:34:48.169 --> 00:34:48.179 align:start position:0%
65 of the services
 
00:34:50.510 --> 00:34:50.520 align:start position:0%
yeah that was for the the developmental
 
00:34:52.369 --> 00:34:52.379 align:start position:0%
disabilities waiver so that's the
 
00:34:54.470 --> 00:34:54.480 align:start position:0%
information that we've received from the
 
00:34:57.650 --> 00:34:57.660 align:start position:0%
area agencies that yes the department
 
00:35:00.470 --> 00:35:00.480 align:start position:0%
has funded all the requests however
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
because of Workforce shortage and lack
 
00:35:04.790 --> 00:35:04.800 align:start position:0%
of providers everyone is not getting
 
00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.380 align:start position:0%
their full complement of service so
 
00:35:09.050 --> 00:35:09.060 align:start position:0%
they're not drawing down all the funds
 
00:35:10.790 --> 00:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
that are available could be available
 
00:35:14.210 --> 00:35:14.220 align:start position:0%
for families is that right sure so how
 
00:35:19.130 --> 00:35:19.140 align:start position:0%
much are we lapsing in that area and
 
00:35:22.069 --> 00:35:22.079 align:start position:0%
how how are we handling the lapses there
 
00:35:26.270 --> 00:35:26.280 align:start position:0%
so so the the hb1 numbers
 
00:35:29.750 --> 00:35:29.760 align:start position:0%
um that that are before you today
 
00:35:32.569 --> 00:35:32.579 align:start position:0%
um we there there there's an hb2
 
00:35:35.390 --> 00:35:35.400 align:start position:0%
provision that would allow us to carry
 
00:35:37.550 --> 00:35:37.560 align:start position:0%
forward the funds that would that would
 
00:35:40.430 --> 00:35:40.440 align:start position:0%
otherwise lapse from this biennium
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
um right now our conservative estimate
 
00:35:46.010 --> 00:35:46.020 align:start position:0%
is about 55 million dollars and and
 
00:35:49.190 --> 00:35:49.200 align:start position:0%
those funds are needed to cover to to
 
00:35:53.210 --> 00:35:53.220 align:start position:0%
cover the wait list costs in 24
 
00:35:55.670 --> 00:35:55.680 align:start position:0%
um however right now we we are still
 
00:35:57.290 --> 00:35:57.300 align:start position:0%
estimating that we may not have
 
00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds within the state fiscal
 
00:36:02.870 --> 00:36:02.880 align:start position:0%
year 25 cup earners recommended to cover
 
00:36:05.510 --> 00:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
all of the waitlist costs
 
00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:07.500 align:start position:0%
um there is a there is a a legislative
 
00:36:07.500 --> 00:36:09.349 align:start position:0%
um there is a there is a a legislative
requirement

00:36:09.349 --> 00:36:09.359 align:start position:0%
requirement
 
00:36:11.150 --> 00:36:11.160 align:start position:0%
um that that requires that we fund that
 
00:36:12.950 --> 00:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
so when we submitted our agency budget
 
00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:15.060 align:start position:0%
requests we included in our prioritized
 
00:36:17.329 --> 00:36:17.339 align:start position:0%
needs funds sufficient at that time
 
00:36:20.210 --> 00:36:20.220 align:start position:0%
based on those projections to cover that
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
um right now it it doesn't necessarily
 
00:36:25.849 --> 00:36:25.859 align:start position:0%
appear that that we have funds
 
00:36:27.710 --> 00:36:27.720 align:start position:0%
sufficient in the second year say fiscal
 
00:36:31.370 --> 00:36:31.380 align:start position:0%
year 25 to cover the full wait list
 
00:36:33.170 --> 00:36:33.180 align:start position:0%
um however that also assumes that the
 
00:36:36.370 --> 00:36:36.380 align:start position:0%
hb2 provision uh that is included today
 
00:36:39.410 --> 00:36:39.420 align:start position:0%
uh stays true otherwise if we're not
 
00:36:42.170 --> 00:36:42.180 align:start position:0%
allowed to carry those funds forward
 
00:36:44.089 --> 00:36:44.099 align:start position:0%
um then we would have a problem further
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
complicating this is is that this
 
00:36:47.750 --> 00:36:47.760 align:start position:0%
account is actually it's actually
 
00:36:50.089 --> 00:36:50.099 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing so it's a little unique in
 
00:36:52.190 --> 00:36:52.200 align:start position:0%
the sense that sometimes our non-lapsing
 
00:36:53.990 --> 00:36:54.000 align:start position:0%
accounts may be off books you know so
 
00:36:57.050 --> 00:36:57.060 align:start position:0%
those funds versus here where you're you
 
00:36:58.190 --> 00:36:58.200 align:start position:0%
know you're reappropriating General
 
00:36:59.810 --> 00:36:59.820 align:start position:0%
funds every year and and there are
 
00:37:02.690 --> 00:37:02.700 align:start position:0%
General funds here so
 
00:37:06.050 --> 00:37:06.060 align:start position:0%
so where in which section of house bill
 
00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:11.270 align:start position:0%
so where in which section of house bill
2.

00:37:11.270 --> 00:37:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:38.150 align:start position:0%
 
2

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:38.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:51.180 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:51.180 --> 00:37:52.730 align:start position:0%
 
thank you

00:37:52.730 --> 00:37:52.740 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:37:55.190 --> 00:37:55.200 align:start position:0%
it's really
 
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:56.750 align:start position:0%
it's really
everything

00:37:56.750 --> 00:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
everything
 
00:37:59.750 --> 00:37:59.760 align:start position:0%
great thank you as we go through
 
00:38:02.630 --> 00:38:02.640 align:start position:0%
this budget today as we continue through
 
00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:04.440 align:start position:0%
there it would be really helpful to me
 
00:38:07.250 --> 00:38:07.260 align:start position:0%
at least if you would talk about any
 
00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:10.320 align:start position:0%
house any house bill two sections that
 
00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:12.900 align:start position:0%
also relate to this and how how they
 
00:38:14.690 --> 00:38:14.700 align:start position:0%
work together and how we for instance
 
00:38:16.430 --> 00:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
you've just pointed out it's important
 
00:38:18.829 --> 00:38:18.839 align:start position:0%
that we keep this section in House Bill
 
00:38:20.290 --> 00:38:20.300 align:start position:0%
2 to make the rest of this work
 
00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:23.640 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you yes and we've all
 
00:38:25.910 --> 00:38:25.920 align:start position:0%
been provided printouts of House Bill 2
 
00:38:29.569 --> 00:38:29.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:31.609 --> 00:38:31.619 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham recognized for
 
00:38:34.250 --> 00:38:34.260 align:start position:0%
a question in terms of your prioritized
 
00:38:36.050 --> 00:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
need I mean aside from the 20 percent
 
00:38:39.349 --> 00:38:39.359 align:start position:0%
that the was in the governor's budget
 
00:38:42.349 --> 00:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
um uh if I understand
 
00:38:43.849 --> 00:38:43.859 align:start position:0%
um you know looking at your budget book
 
00:38:47.450 --> 00:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
here on page 18 that you requested
 
00:38:47.460 --> 00:38:47.990 align:start position:0%
here on page 18 that you requested
um

00:38:47.990 --> 00:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:52.560 align:start position:0%
so it was going from 347 to 417
 
00:38:55.490 --> 00:38:55.500 align:start position:0%
um from 2023 to the governor's budget in
 
00:38:59.710 --> 00:38:59.720 align:start position:0%
2025 but you actually requested 592
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
million dollars on the developmental
 
00:39:04.810 --> 00:39:04.820 align:start position:0%
Services waiver
 
00:39:08.390 --> 00:39:08.400 align:start position:0%
as a prioritized need I guess in order
 
00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:10.020 align:start position:0%
to fulfill
 
00:39:10.020 --> 00:39:10.609 align:start position:0%
to fulfill
um

00:39:10.609 --> 00:39:10.619 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:13.980 align:start position:0%
uh well not not the wait list but I
 
00:39:16.670 --> 00:39:16.680 align:start position:0%
guess the Gap in in Services provided
 
00:39:18.770 --> 00:39:18.780 align:start position:0%
can you talk at all about how that
 
00:39:22.430 --> 00:39:22.440 align:start position:0%
agency request number came and
 
00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.870 align:start position:0%
agency request number came and
um

00:39:23.870 --> 00:39:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:39:27.290 --> 00:39:27.300 align:start position:0%
what the impact will be if we just have
 
00:39:29.630 --> 00:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget uh item on there
 
00:39:32.569 --> 00:39:32.579 align:start position:0%
and it looks like just the caseload
 
00:39:35.810 --> 00:39:35.820 align:start position:0%
numbers are the same in both cases so
 
00:39:37.730 --> 00:39:37.740 align:start position:0%
um I'll just leave that to you there
 
00:39:42.650 --> 00:39:42.660 align:start position:0%
sure so so I I will let me address the
 
00:39:45.470 --> 00:39:45.480 align:start position:0%
the budget side first
 
00:39:48.650 --> 00:39:48.660 align:start position:0%
um so so the when we put our agency
 
00:39:50.089 --> 00:39:50.099 align:start position:0%
budget together we're putting it
 
00:39:52.130 --> 00:39:52.140 align:start position:0%
together back in August
 
00:39:54.770 --> 00:39:54.780 align:start position:0%
um the data systems that that we do rely
 
00:39:56.990 --> 00:39:57.000 align:start position:0%
on as Melissa indicated earlier we are
 
00:39:59.030 --> 00:39:59.040 align:start position:0%
we are seeking to upgrade those to give
 
00:40:02.089 --> 00:40:02.099 align:start position:0%
us better and more accurate information
 
00:40:04.609 --> 00:40:04.619 align:start position:0%
um based on the most recent analysis uh
 
00:40:07.210 --> 00:40:07.220 align:start position:0%
we we would need approximately
 
00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:12.000 align:start position:0%
64 million dollars total 50 50 Federal
 
00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.390 align:start position:0%
64 million dollars total 50 50 Federal
General

00:40:13.390 --> 00:40:13.400 align:start position:0%
General
 
00:40:16.370 --> 00:40:16.380 align:start position:0%
in-state fiscal year for for all the
 
00:40:18.650 --> 00:40:18.660 align:start position:0%
waitlist services
 
00:40:20.150 --> 00:40:20.160 align:start position:0%
um that that would be required and
 
00:40:21.230 --> 00:40:21.240 align:start position:0%
Melissa I don't know if you want to
 
00:40:25.550 --> 00:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.849 --> 00:40:28.859 align:start position:0%
yeah so um again because of
 
00:40:30.710 --> 00:40:30.720 align:start position:0%
um we haven't had any sort of rate
 
00:40:33.349 --> 00:40:33.359 align:start position:0%
changes or significant rate studies
 
00:40:36.410 --> 00:40:36.420 align:start position:0%
since 20 2007
 
00:40:38.810 --> 00:40:38.820 align:start position:0%
um we were projecting that the cost of
 
00:40:40.190 --> 00:40:40.200 align:start position:0%
those services and the new service
 
00:40:42.170 --> 00:40:42.180 align:start position:0%
Suites would go up as we're doing this
 
00:40:48.109 --> 00:40:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:50.329 --> 00:40:50.339 align:start position:0%
um so so basically you're saying in part
 
00:40:54.410 --> 00:40:54.420 align:start position:0%
that the rates um uh the need might not
 
00:40:56.690 --> 00:40:56.700 align:start position:0%
be as great as it was at the time you
 
00:40:59.630 --> 00:40:59.640 align:start position:0%
developed a prioritized list
 
00:41:02.390 --> 00:41:02.400 align:start position:0%
um and um is the current budget then
 
00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:04.200 align:start position:0%
fully funding
 
00:41:06.710 --> 00:41:06.720 align:start position:0%
what you what you're what you think you
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
need in order to reduce the wait list
 
00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:12.000 align:start position:0%
um for those already in the system or is
 
00:41:13.970 --> 00:41:13.980 align:start position:0%
it partially does it partially get you
 
00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:15.890 align:start position:0%
it partially does it partially get you
there

00:41:15.890 --> 00:41:15.900 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:41:22.250 --> 00:41:22.260 align:start position:0%
so so 24 is is fully funded provided the
 
00:41:24.710 --> 00:41:24.720 align:start position:0%
hb2 provision
 
00:41:30.290 --> 00:41:30.300 align:start position:0%
um uh 232 I believe it was uh stands
 
00:41:33.349 --> 00:41:33.359 align:start position:0%
um for 25 we would still need the
 
00:41:35.510 --> 00:41:35.520 align:start position:0%
additional 32 million dollars of General
 
00:41:35.520 --> 00:41:37.250 align:start position:0%
additional 32 million dollars of General
funds

00:41:37.250 --> 00:41:37.260 align:start position:0%
funds
 
00:41:39.290 --> 00:41:39.300 align:start position:0%
um and and that assumes
 
00:41:41.690 --> 00:41:41.700 align:start position:0%
um that that assumes you know that that
 
00:41:43.910 --> 00:41:43.920 align:start position:0%
the weight in order to ensure that the
 
00:41:45.890 --> 00:41:45.900 align:start position:0%
wait list is covered we would need those
 
00:41:48.410 --> 00:41:48.420 align:start position:0%
funds now we will still of course have
 
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
the challenge of of the provider issue
 
00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:53.820 align:start position:0%
in the community which is why we're
 
00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.160 align:start position:0%
projected to lapse roughly 55 million
 
00:42:00.950 --> 00:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:03.349 --> 00:42:03.359 align:start position:0%
thank you may proceed
 
00:42:06.589 --> 00:42:06.599 align:start position:0%
okay turning to slide eight just a few
 
00:42:09.230 --> 00:42:09.240 align:start position:0%
key challenges I think we talked a lot
 
00:42:09.240 --> 00:42:10.490 align:start position:0%
key challenges I think we talked a lot
about

00:42:10.490 --> 00:42:10.500 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:42:12.589 --> 00:42:12.599 align:start position:0%
um workforces not just in developmental
 
00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
Services we have Workforce issues
 
00:42:18.710 --> 00:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
um on the Aging and Disability side and
 
00:42:21.710 --> 00:42:21.720 align:start position:0%
also with our Bureau of family centered
 
00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:23.569 align:start position:0%
also with our Bureau of family centered
services

00:42:23.569 --> 00:42:23.579 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:42:24.910 --> 00:42:24.920 align:start position:0%
um you know philosophically
 
00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:27.180 align:start position:0%
incorporating you know all of our work
 
00:42:29.569 --> 00:42:29.579 align:start position:0%
is person-centered incorporating that
 
00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:32.220 align:start position:0%
within our everyday practice and policy
 
00:42:34.069 --> 00:42:34.079 align:start position:0%
decisions and our guidance that we
 
00:42:36.890 --> 00:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
receive from CMS
 
00:42:39.170 --> 00:42:39.180 align:start position:0%
um I I cannot
 
00:42:42.109 --> 00:42:42.119 align:start position:0%
um emphasize enough that adequate I.T
 
00:42:44.450 --> 00:42:44.460 align:start position:0%
system for us to be able to automate
 
00:42:46.370 --> 00:42:46.380 align:start position:0%
some of these
 
00:42:50.150 --> 00:42:50.160 align:start position:0%
um areas that we manually or really do
 
00:42:52.730 --> 00:42:52.740 align:start position:0%
on an Excel spreadsheet and you know
 
00:42:57.109 --> 00:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
provide uh that sort of information so
 
00:43:00.170 --> 00:43:00.180 align:start position:0%
we're not physically counting things but
 
00:43:02.390 --> 00:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
also being able to pay our providers
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
quicker right now it's a paper paper
 
00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:06.720 align:start position:0%
service on the developmental disability
 
00:43:08.390 --> 00:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
side where
 
00:43:10.010 --> 00:43:10.020 align:start position:0%
um we have a department that gets
 
00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
paperwork from the providers and then
 
00:43:14.510 --> 00:43:14.520 align:start position:0%
they have to push that through in order
 
00:43:17.809 --> 00:43:17.819 align:start position:0%
to pay them and in our new system a lot
 
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:20.220 align:start position:0%
of those processes will be automatic so
 
00:43:22.609 --> 00:43:22.619 align:start position:0%
we're excited that that will be able to
 
00:43:24.770 --> 00:43:24.780 align:start position:0%
get payments out to Providers a lot
 
00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:26.870 align:start position:0%
get payments out to Providers a lot
quicker

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:26.880 align:start position:0%
quicker
 
00:43:28.730 --> 00:43:28.740 align:start position:0%
and then just kind of
 
00:43:31.670 --> 00:43:31.680 align:start position:0%
um limited staff like I said our
 
00:43:33.829 --> 00:43:33.839 align:start position:0%
staffing is is pretty good with within
 
00:43:35.630 --> 00:43:35.640 align:start position:0%
the division with seven open positions
 
00:43:37.490 --> 00:43:37.500 align:start position:0%
but we've been really focusing on
 
00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:39.050 align:start position:0%
but we've been really focusing on
recruiting

00:43:39.050 --> 00:43:39.060 align:start position:0%
recruiting
 
00:43:41.390 --> 00:43:41.400 align:start position:0%
um and retaining employees but
 
00:43:43.250 --> 00:43:43.260 align:start position:0%
um you know sometimes there are
 
00:43:45.109 --> 00:43:45.119 align:start position:0%
additional things that come on board
 
00:43:47.450 --> 00:43:47.460 align:start position:0%
like a new grant that
 
00:43:50.150 --> 00:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
um you know that we spend some time on
 
00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740 align:start position:0%
um so just having kind of limited staff
 
00:43:55.010 --> 00:43:55.020 align:start position:0%
to maintain current operations but then
 
00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:57.660 align:start position:0%
anything else that may pop up
 
00:43:59.210 --> 00:43:59.220 align:start position:0%
um that we need to focus our attention
 
00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.050 align:start position:0%
um that we need to focus our attention
on

00:44:00.050 --> 00:44:00.060 align:start position:0%
on
 
00:44:00.060 --> 00:44:06.849 align:start position:0%
on
foreign

00:44:06.849 --> 00:44:06.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:11.510 --> 00:44:11.520 align:start position:0%
nine and ten go into
 
00:44:11.520 --> 00:44:12.170 align:start position:0%
nine and ten go into
um

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:12.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:14.510 --> 00:44:14.520 align:start position:0%
the accounting units for the Bureau of
 
00:44:16.790 --> 00:44:16.800 align:start position:0%
elderly and Adult Services so just a
 
00:44:20.030 --> 00:44:20.040 align:start position:0%
quick kind of recap Bureau of elderly
 
00:44:22.309 --> 00:44:22.319 align:start position:0%
and Adult Services administers The Adult
 
00:44:24.550 --> 00:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
Protective Services programs
 
00:44:27.010 --> 00:44:27.020 align:start position:0%
funds home and community-based services
 
00:44:30.430 --> 00:44:30.440 align:start position:0%
for non-medicaid eligible individuals
 
00:44:33.410 --> 00:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
also the Aging and Disability Resource
 
00:44:36.349 --> 00:44:36.359 align:start position:0%
Center service link is under the Bureau
 
00:44:38.870 --> 00:44:38.880 align:start position:0%
of elderly and Adult Services
 
00:44:41.809 --> 00:44:41.819 align:start position:0%
and nursing facilities and our choices
 
00:44:45.370 --> 00:44:45.380 align:start position:0%
for Independence Medicaid waiver that
 
00:44:48.109 --> 00:44:48.119 align:start position:0%
approximately serves about 3 800 older
 
00:45:04.069 --> 00:45:04.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:06.650 --> 00:45:06.660 align:start position:0%
and and I I don't know if this is a Time
 
00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
whether you'd like to go through those
 
00:45:09.589 --> 00:45:09.599 align:start position:0%
accounting units and ask any questions
 
00:45:10.790 --> 00:45:10.800 align:start position:0%
or not
 
00:45:11.990 --> 00:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
um but you just want to put that out
 
00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:12.650 align:start position:0%
um but you just want to put that out
there

00:45:12.650 --> 00:45:12.660 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:45:15.109 --> 00:45:15.119 align:start position:0%
I was thinking that would be appropriate
 
00:45:17.150 --> 00:45:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh why don't we go through that sure if
 
00:45:20.030 --> 00:45:20.040 align:start position:0%
we could so we'll start on page 925 is
 
00:45:21.710 --> 00:45:21.720 align:start position:0%
that the starting point that is the
 
00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:23.520 align:start position:0%
starting point all right
 
00:45:25.130 --> 00:45:25.140 align:start position:0%
and again I I don't want to make it an
 
00:45:28.069 --> 00:45:28.079 align:start position:0%
all-day Affair but I I think you're with
 
00:45:30.230 --> 00:45:30.240 align:start position:0%
me in terms of uh going through as
 
00:45:34.790 --> 00:45:34.800 align:start position:0%
thoroughly as we can yeah so um in in uh
 
00:45:38.510 --> 00:45:38.520 align:start position:0%
so 92.50 uh beginning on page 925 going
 
00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
on to page 926. um as most indicated
 
00:45:43.309 --> 00:45:43.319 align:start position:0%
earlier this is where bulk of the
 
00:45:45.109 --> 00:45:45.119 align:start position:0%
positions are the Adult Protective
 
00:45:46.790 --> 00:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
Service workers
 
00:45:49.609 --> 00:45:49.619 align:start position:0%
um one one change you will see in class
 
00:45:52.970 --> 00:45:52.980 align:start position:0%
10 we did previously have unfunded
 
00:45:57.530 --> 00:45:57.540 align:start position:0%
positions uh we we've funded uh a few of
 
00:45:59.809 --> 00:45:59.819 align:start position:0%
those positions in this biennium and and
 
00:46:02.930 --> 00:46:02.940 align:start position:0%
that's why you see that increase in the
 
00:46:06.470 --> 00:46:06.480 align:start position:0%
class 10 there on page 925.
 
00:46:09.230 --> 00:46:09.240 align:start position:0%
um you'll also see the in the class uh
 
00:46:13.250 --> 00:46:13.260 align:start position:0%
50 on the subsequent page uh we we also
 
00:46:18.770 --> 00:46:18.780 align:start position:0%
added added a a position there as well
 
00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:21.000 align:start position:0%
um and then we we were able to fill one
 
00:46:23.150 --> 00:46:23.160 align:start position:0%
of the existing uh temperate positions
 
00:46:25.069 --> 00:46:25.079 align:start position:0%
uh with somebody that had a lot of
 
00:46:26.750 --> 00:46:26.760 align:start position:0%
experience so we had to hire them at a
 
00:46:28.190 --> 00:46:28.200 align:start position:0%
higher labor grade which is part of the
 
00:46:30.470 --> 00:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
part of the reason for the increase in
 
00:46:32.990 --> 00:46:33.000 align:start position:0%
that line there uh the the federal funds
 
00:46:35.390 --> 00:46:35.400 align:start position:0%
uh these are these are Medicaid admin
 
00:46:37.010 --> 00:46:37.020 align:start position:0%
funds we actually have to conduct a Time
 
00:46:39.829 --> 00:46:39.839 align:start position:0%
study uh on an ongoing basis for that
 
00:46:41.510 --> 00:46:41.520 align:start position:0%
but primarily
 
00:46:44.450 --> 00:46:44.460 align:start position:0%
um the remaining roughly 90 of the funds
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
in this in this account are General
 
00:46:46.079 --> 00:46:49.490 align:start position:0%
in this in this account are General
funds

00:46:49.490 --> 00:46:49.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:52.130 --> 00:46:52.140 align:start position:0%
representative walner
 
00:46:54.410 --> 00:46:54.420 align:start position:0%
in this so this is the unit where the
 
00:46:57.170 --> 00:46:57.180 align:start position:0%
Protective Service workers are so what
 
00:47:00.349 --> 00:47:00.359 align:start position:0%
is the caseload that the
 
00:47:01.849 --> 00:47:01.859 align:start position:0%
sure so
 
00:47:01.859 --> 00:47:02.870 align:start position:0%
sure so
um

00:47:02.870 --> 00:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:06.170 --> 00:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
my case load right here and we so we
 
00:47:07.910 --> 00:47:07.920 align:start position:0%
have different district offices so the
 
00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:09.720 align:start position:0%
case loads are a little bit different
 
00:47:11.990 --> 00:47:12.000 align:start position:0%
but for the total
 
00:47:16.550 --> 00:47:16.560 align:start position:0%
um from seven one of 21 to 6 30 of 22 uh
 
00:47:21.890 --> 00:47:21.900 align:start position:0%
we had about 4069 cases total
 
00:47:23.750 --> 00:47:23.760 align:start position:0%
um we are working
 
00:47:26.890 --> 00:47:26.900 align:start position:0%
um with the union and some um
 
00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:28.809 align:start position:0%
um with the union and some um
APS

00:47:28.809 --> 00:47:28.819 align:start position:0%
APS
 
00:47:32.030 --> 00:47:32.040 align:start position:0%
workers on what's a national standard
 
00:47:35.510 --> 00:47:35.520 align:start position:0%
for caseload there isn't one for APF as
 
00:47:37.069 --> 00:47:37.079 align:start position:0%
there are for maybe some other
 
00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:38.880 align:start position:0%
protective work so we're really looking
 
00:47:41.750 --> 00:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
at you know what types of cases can we
 
00:47:43.970 --> 00:47:43.980 align:start position:0%
do we need to you know maybe it's more
 
00:47:46.790 --> 00:47:46.800 align:start position:0%
of an information and referral or is it
 
00:47:48.650 --> 00:47:48.660 align:start position:0%
somebody looking to get on Medicaid or
 
00:47:51.050 --> 00:47:51.060 align:start position:0%
is it truly somebody who's at risk for
 
00:47:53.630 --> 00:47:53.640 align:start position:0%
abuse neglect exploitation
 
00:47:58.069 --> 00:47:58.079 align:start position:0%
so um the 70 workers that we have
 
00:48:00.410 --> 00:48:00.420 align:start position:0%
how many what is their caseload how many
 
00:48:02.390 --> 00:48:02.400 align:start position:0%
are they averaging
 
00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
um so again it's it's different because
 
00:48:06.349 --> 00:48:06.359 align:start position:0%
they're all um designated in different
 
00:48:08.569 --> 00:48:08.579 align:start position:0%
district offices
 
00:48:11.329 --> 00:48:11.339 align:start position:0%
um so we're looking at anywhere between
 
00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
I believe the the most recent number
 
00:48:21.710 --> 00:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:24.170 --> 00:48:24.180 align:start position:0%
provide you a copy of uh the case gold
 
00:48:26.510 --> 00:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
report too if that would be helpful
 
00:48:31.790 --> 00:48:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:34.190 --> 00:48:34.200 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham per question
 
00:48:36.050 --> 00:48:36.060 align:start position:0%
um it's the caseload are those numbers
 
00:48:38.690 --> 00:48:38.700 align:start position:0%
similar to what's on in the budget book
 
00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:45.720 align:start position:0%
under the
 
00:48:49.010 --> 00:48:49.020 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:57.410 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:48:57.410 --> 00:48:57.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:00.950 --> 00:49:00.960 align:start position:0%
if there are no other questions uh on on
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
that account we can move to the next
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
it's 78 72 administrative Administration
 
00:49:08.329 --> 00:49:08.339 align:start position:0%
on Aging
 
00:49:12.109 --> 00:49:12.119 align:start position:0%
um your your personnel lines on page 926
 
00:49:15.230 --> 00:49:15.240 align:start position:0%
stay relatively stagnant with the
 
00:49:19.069 --> 00:49:19.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:22.849 --> 00:49:22.859 align:start position:0%
um on page 927 the class 40 the indirect
 
00:49:25.130 --> 00:49:25.140 align:start position:0%
cost line that's zeroed out um that's
 
00:49:26.750 --> 00:49:26.760 align:start position:0%
part of that centralization of our
 
00:49:28.910 --> 00:49:28.920 align:start position:0%
indirect costs into ocom and to account
 
00:49:31.370 --> 00:49:31.380 align:start position:0%
9 500.
 
00:49:33.470 --> 00:49:33.480 align:start position:0%
um this this account and I I'll let
 
00:49:35.630 --> 00:49:35.640 align:start position:0%
Melissa speak to this more in detail um
 
00:49:38.630 --> 00:49:38.640 align:start position:0%
there's approximately 69 contracts that
 
00:49:40.849 --> 00:49:40.859 align:start position:0%
are funded out of this out of this
 
00:49:42.170 --> 00:49:42.180 align:start position:0%
account and most I don't know if you
 
00:49:43.190 --> 00:49:43.200 align:start position:0%
want to talk a little bit about those
 
00:49:47.930 --> 00:49:47.940 align:start position:0%
yeah sure so we contract for services
 
00:49:50.270 --> 00:49:50.280 align:start position:0%
um under the older Americans act title 3
 
00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:52.200 align:start position:0%
program and the nutrition service
 
00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:55.680 align:start position:0%
incentive program so this
 
00:49:58.069 --> 00:49:58.079 align:start position:0%
um really pays for things like home
 
00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:00.260 align:start position:0%
delivered and congregate meals
 
00:50:02.950 --> 00:50:02.960 align:start position:0%
Transportation caregiver support
 
00:50:05.870 --> 00:50:05.880 align:start position:0%
Medicare counseling Home Health Services
 
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
Adult Day Services senior companion
 
00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:11.950 align:start position:0%
Adult Day Services senior companion
programs

00:50:11.950 --> 00:50:11.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:14.990 --> 00:50:15.000 align:start position:0%
and um representative Wallner for a
 
00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:17.390 align:start position:0%
and um representative Wallner for a
question

00:50:17.390 --> 00:50:17.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:19.250 --> 00:50:19.260 align:start position:0%
if you can just talk a little more about
 
00:50:21.829 --> 00:50:21.839 align:start position:0%
the home delivered meals and the
 
00:50:24.470 --> 00:50:24.480 align:start position:0%
congregate meals and what I'd really be
 
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
interested in is
 
00:50:28.790 --> 00:50:28.800 align:start position:0%
what we are providing as a rate for
 
00:50:32.329 --> 00:50:32.339 align:start position:0%
those meals and is there a rate increase
 
00:50:34.490 --> 00:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
built in
 
00:50:34.500 --> 00:50:35.990 align:start position:0%
built in
um

00:50:35.990 --> 00:50:36.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:50:37.970 --> 00:50:37.980 align:start position:0%
you know just talk a little bit more
 
00:50:40.910 --> 00:50:40.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:43.130 --> 00:50:43.140 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:50:47.930 --> 00:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
in in-house Bill 2 on page 82 section 2
 
00:50:47.940 --> 00:50:50.270 align:start position:0%
in in-house Bill 2 on page 82 section 2
255.

00:50:50.270 --> 00:50:50.280 align:start position:0%
255.
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
um there is an appropriation made for
 
00:50:54.790 --> 00:50:54.800 align:start position:0%
nutrition and transportation services
 
00:50:57.410 --> 00:50:57.420 align:start position:0%
and the department had made this request
 
00:50:58.970 --> 00:50:58.980 align:start position:0%
because we had received temporary
 
00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
one-time funding uh from the federal
 
00:51:05.089 --> 00:51:05.099 align:start position:0%
government and we had provided a rate
 
00:51:07.430 --> 00:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
increase at that time and this would
 
00:51:10.069 --> 00:51:10.079 align:start position:0%
continue this hb2 provision would
 
00:51:13.010 --> 00:51:13.020 align:start position:0%
continue that rate increase without it
 
00:51:14.990 --> 00:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
we would either have to reduce rates or
 
00:51:17.809 --> 00:51:17.819 align:start position:0%
Services I I don't have the specific
 
00:51:20.270 --> 00:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
figure for what the rate increase was at
 
00:51:21.530 --> 00:51:21.540 align:start position:0%
the time I don't know if you have
 
00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:27.190 align:start position:0%
the time I don't know if you have
Melissa

00:51:27.190 --> 00:51:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:35.089 --> 00:51:35.099 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:37.670 --> 00:51:37.680 align:start position:0%
index opening up spreadsheet and we're
 
00:51:39.109 --> 00:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
also when you're there looking for the
 
00:51:42.470 --> 00:51:42.480 align:start position:0%
section in-house built 2.
 
00:51:48.290 --> 00:51:48.300 align:start position:0%
it was section 255 it's it's on page 82.
 
00:51:51.049 --> 00:51:51.059 align:start position:0%
it appropriates uh 3.4 million dollars
 
00:51:52.549 --> 00:51:52.559 align:start position:0%
of General funds in each year of the
 
00:51:52.559 --> 00:51:54.950 align:start position:0%
of General funds in each year of the
biennium

00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
biennium
 
00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:58.849 align:start position:0%
biennium
approximately

00:51:58.849 --> 00:51:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:01.370 --> 00:52:01.380 align:start position:0%
yes so the cost per meal is eight
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
dollars and 11 cents currently
 
00:52:07.190 --> 00:52:07.200 align:start position:0%
that's the cost and what is that what we
 
00:52:08.569 --> 00:52:08.579 align:start position:0%
are that's the rate yes that's the rate
 
00:52:08.579 --> 00:52:09.950 align:start position:0%
are that's the rate yes that's the rate
okay

00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:11.150 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:52:11.150 --> 00:52:11.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:14.870 --> 00:52:14.880 align:start position:0%
so this section 255
 
00:52:17.809 --> 00:52:17.819 align:start position:0%
that is here in house bill 2.
 
00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:21.540 align:start position:0%
that will that is really not an increase
 
00:52:24.530 --> 00:52:24.540 align:start position:0%
over what they're getting now because
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
this just keeps them at flat yeah yeah
 
00:52:30.470 --> 00:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
it maintains what we provided through
 
00:52:33.770 --> 00:52:33.780 align:start position:0%
our funding for this year okay so what
 
00:52:36.530 --> 00:52:36.540 align:start position:0%
is there something here for next year
 
00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:40.700 align:start position:0%
and the next year rate increase
 
00:52:43.730 --> 00:52:43.740 align:start position:0%
we we do not currently have anything in
 
00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
our budget for that
 
00:52:48.109 --> 00:52:48.119 align:start position:0%
so no rate increase for Meals on Wheels
 
00:52:50.329 --> 00:52:50.339 align:start position:0%
or congregate meals
 
00:52:53.930 --> 00:52:53.940 align:start position:0%
in this in this particular
 
00:53:00.829 --> 00:53:00.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:03.290 --> 00:53:03.300 align:start position:0%
representative erf for a question
 
00:53:04.910 --> 00:53:04.920 align:start position:0%
so just understand what representative
 
00:53:07.130 --> 00:53:07.140 align:start position:0%
Walden was asking there so that three or
 
00:53:08.150 --> 00:53:08.160 align:start position:0%
four million dollars whatever that was
 
00:53:10.069 --> 00:53:10.079 align:start position:0%
that's on top of the four million
 
00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:11.520 align:start position:0%
dollars that's in
 
00:53:15.410 --> 00:53:15.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:17.630 --> 00:53:17.640 align:start position:0%
yes yep so so that would be in addition
 
00:53:20.510 --> 00:53:20.520 align:start position:0%
to the in addition to the the figures uh
 
00:53:23.390 --> 00:53:23.400 align:start position:0%
that you see here in the 500 series yes
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
and part of that is that arpa was
 
00:53:25.970 --> 00:53:25.980 align:start position:0%
already providing that additional
 
00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:28.380 align:start position:0%
funding in the current biennium I
 
00:53:30.470 --> 00:53:30.480 align:start position:0%
believe it was arpa funds or some
 
00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:32.940 align:start position:0%
federal funds yes it was arpa funds okay
 
00:53:36.589 --> 00:53:36.599 align:start position:0%
yes and previous to that so pre-covet I
 
00:53:40.970 --> 00:53:40.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:43.730 --> 00:53:43.740 align:start position:0%
I I don't want to speculate I would
 
00:53:44.809 --> 00:53:44.819 align:start position:0%
assume so
 
00:53:47.930 --> 00:53:47.940 align:start position:0%
um I I'll go back and verify okay
 
00:53:52.130 --> 00:53:52.140 align:start position:0%
and so what is the jump more services
 
00:53:53.569 --> 00:53:53.579 align:start position:0%
and that's like a doubling right of
 
00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:56.040 align:start position:0%
what's here yeah so there was a a
 
00:53:59.630 --> 00:53:59.640 align:start position:0%
discussion about increasing the the rate
 
00:54:02.809 --> 00:54:02.819 align:start position:0%
of the meal versus reducing the number
 
00:54:05.329 --> 00:54:05.339 align:start position:0%
of actual meals to cover the costs of
 
00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:07.980 align:start position:0%
the meal provider so food costs were
 
00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:09.420 align:start position:0%
going up
 
00:54:12.049 --> 00:54:12.059 align:start position:0%
um and so Wendy and her team had
 
00:54:15.049 --> 00:54:15.059 align:start position:0%
discussions with the meal providers to
 
00:54:17.690 --> 00:54:17.700 align:start position:0%
talk about if we were able to add this
 
00:54:19.790 --> 00:54:19.800 align:start position:0%
additional funding would it go towards a
 
00:54:22.490 --> 00:54:22.500 align:start position:0%
rate or would it go towards more meals
 
00:54:25.190 --> 00:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
but because of the cost of meals going
 
00:54:28.370 --> 00:54:28.380 align:start position:0%
up we increased the rate not enough not
 
00:54:31.970 --> 00:54:31.980 align:start position:0%
necessarily the amount of units okay and
 
00:54:34.609 --> 00:54:34.619 align:start position:0%
then regarding 541 the
 
00:54:37.010 --> 00:54:37.020 align:start position:0%
the other part of it
 
00:54:39.710 --> 00:54:39.720 align:start position:0%
so I'm guessing that if we're not
 
00:54:41.930 --> 00:54:41.940 align:start position:0%
guessing fy22 is actual
 
00:54:44.089 --> 00:54:44.099 align:start position:0%
fy23 is adjusted actual which brought
 
00:54:47.210 --> 00:54:47.220 align:start position:0%
money over from FY 22. so that's
 
00:54:48.829 --> 00:54:48.839 align:start position:0%
basically an increase over the current
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
biennium carry forward to the next
 
00:54:53.569 --> 00:54:53.579 align:start position:0%
biennium is there what accounts for that
 
00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:55.140 align:start position:0%
if I have that correct if I understand
 
00:55:14.470 --> 00:55:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:17.160 align:start position:0%
uh representative can you can you
 
00:55:18.650 --> 00:55:18.660 align:start position:0%
clarify which class line you're
 
00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:21.660 align:start position:0%
referring to 541 is that correct
 
00:55:21.660 --> 00:55:23.109 align:start position:0%
referring to 541 is that correct
okay

00:55:23.109 --> 00:55:23.119 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:55:28.010 --> 00:55:28.020 align:start position:0%
so 541 was it was budgeted at uh
 
00:55:31.930 --> 00:55:31.940 align:start position:0%
approximately 2 2.25 million dollars
 
00:55:38.809 --> 00:55:38.819 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:40.790 --> 00:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
well that doesn't quite make sense does
 
00:55:43.849 --> 00:55:43.859 align:start position:0%
it because or does the money not lapse I
 
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:45.480 align:start position:0%
mean uh Carey good carried forward from
 
00:55:48.710 --> 00:55:48.720 align:start position:0%
23 to 24. so from 22 to 23 excuse me so
 
00:55:51.349 --> 00:55:51.359 align:start position:0%
we we so we we don't for for this
 
00:55:53.089 --> 00:55:53.099 align:start position:0%
particular account we we don't have the
 
00:55:54.530 --> 00:55:54.540 align:start position:0%
authority to carry those funds forward
 
00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
unless they're encumbered oh okay thank
 
00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:57.290 align:start position:0%
unless they're encumbered oh okay thank
you

00:55:57.290 --> 00:55:57.300 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:00.370 align:start position:0%
you
foreign

00:56:00.370 --> 00:56:00.380 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:02.750 --> 00:56:02.760 align:start position:0%
ER could I just ask one more question
 
00:56:04.970 --> 00:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
about Meals on Wheels and congregate
 
00:56:07.790 --> 00:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
meals do we do they the providers
 
00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:09.900 align:start position:0%
presently have a waiting list
 
00:56:09.900 --> 00:56:11.329 align:start position:0%
presently have a waiting list
of

00:56:11.329 --> 00:56:11.339 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:56:14.150 --> 00:56:14.160 align:start position:0%
um clients that are eligible
 
00:56:27.530 --> 00:56:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:29.150 --> 00:56:29.160 align:start position:0%
I'll have to get back to you I don't we
 
00:56:30.829 --> 00:56:30.839 align:start position:0%
don't have the answer if there's uh
 
00:56:33.170 --> 00:56:33.180 align:start position:0%
waiting lists for folks who signed up
 
00:56:38.410 --> 00:56:38.420 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:40.549 --> 00:56:40.559 align:start position:0%
representative talerski for a question
 
00:56:42.290 --> 00:56:42.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:43.670 --> 00:56:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's supposed to just give us an idea of
 
00:56:45.049 --> 00:56:45.059 align:start position:0%
the number of
 
00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
people who rely on this service either
 
00:56:48.589 --> 00:56:48.599 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis or the number of meals
 
00:56:48.599 --> 00:56:49.670 align:start position:0%
on a daily basis or the number of meals
served

00:56:49.670 --> 00:56:49.680 align:start position:0%
served
 
00:57:12.910 --> 00:57:12.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:15.290 --> 00:57:15.300 align:start position:0%
yeah I don't have the actual number with
 
00:57:18.410 --> 00:57:18.420 align:start position:0%
you but um Wendy will get that for you
 
00:57:21.490 --> 00:57:21.500 align:start position:0%
but it's it's a significant amount of
 
00:57:23.510 --> 00:57:23.520 align:start position:0%
I don't want to say what she said but
 
00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:25.260 align:start position:0%
you know hundreds of thousands of meals
 
00:57:27.589 --> 00:57:27.599 align:start position:0%
that we do provide uh I can get you kind
 
00:57:30.290 --> 00:57:30.300 align:start position:0%
of what we what we've paid out in meals
 
00:57:32.690 --> 00:57:32.700 align:start position:0%
and wheels in congregate yeah I'm really
 
00:57:34.549 --> 00:57:34.559 align:start position:0%
just curious how many people on a daily
 
00:57:37.430 --> 00:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
basis require this service
 
00:57:40.609 --> 00:57:40.619 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:42.950 --> 00:57:42.960 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for question
 
00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:45.839 align:start position:0%
um in the budget book on page four it
 
00:57:49.130 --> 00:57:49.140 align:start position:0%
has caseload listed under Bureau of
 
00:57:52.370 --> 00:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
elderly and Adult Services you know 30
 
00:57:54.950 --> 00:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
30 31 000
 
00:57:57.790 --> 00:57:57.800 align:start position:0%
um is that number a daily
 
00:58:00.650 --> 00:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
eligible of people to get these kind of
 
00:58:12.230 --> 00:58:12.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:14.150 --> 00:58:14.160 align:start position:0%
so this caseload number would be
 
00:58:16.309 --> 00:58:16.319 align:start position:0%
inclusive of not just meals but some of
 
00:58:19.430 --> 00:58:19.440 align:start position:0%
the other services that I had talked
 
00:58:21.790 --> 00:58:21.800 align:start position:0%
about meaning Home Care
 
00:58:24.490 --> 00:58:24.500 align:start position:0%
Transportation Services
 
00:58:26.990 --> 00:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
caregiver support those those type of
 
00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:33.530 align:start position:0%
caregiver support those those type of
services

00:58:33.530 --> 00:58:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:37.490 --> 00:58:37.500 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:38.690 --> 00:58:38.700 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:58:43.270 --> 00:58:43.280 align:start position:0%
um if we turn to page
 
00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:44.950 align:start position:0%
um if we turn to page

you have account
 
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
89 17 this is a relatively small Federal
 
00:58:54.650 --> 00:58:54.660 align:start position:0%
grant that's under title 3D
 
00:58:54.660 --> 00:58:56.990 align:start position:0%
grant that's under title 3D
um

00:58:56.990 --> 00:58:57.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:58.510 --> 00:58:58.520 align:start position:0%
I don't know if there's any questions
 
00:59:02.450 --> 00:59:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:04.250 --> 00:59:04.260 align:start position:0%
representative walner for question so
 
00:59:07.309 --> 00:59:07.319 align:start position:0%
how do the Meals on Wheels
 
00:59:07.319 --> 00:59:08.270 align:start position:0%
how do the Meals on Wheels
um

00:59:08.270 --> 00:59:08.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:59:10.670 --> 00:59:10.680 align:start position:0%
on this page relate to the other page
 
00:59:13.130 --> 00:59:13.140 align:start position:0%
and as
 
00:59:17.270 --> 00:59:17.280 align:start position:0%
the section in House Bill 2
 
00:59:19.490 --> 00:59:19.500 align:start position:0%
is part of the sectionary hospital to go
 
00:59:24.589 --> 00:59:24.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
cover the rate increase here okay this
 
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:32.579 align:start position:0%
is so so so so you're you're on page 927
 
00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
00:59:38.690 --> 00:59:38.700 align:start position:0%
I'm on page 928 it's called Social
 
00:59:40.490 --> 00:59:40.500 align:start position:0%
Service block grant and this is the
 
00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:45.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:47.150 align:start position:0%
 
yep

00:59:47.150 --> 00:59:47.160 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:59:49.910 --> 00:59:49.920 align:start position:0%
so so we have a couple of different okay
 
00:59:53.990 --> 00:59:54.000 align:start position:0%
so we have our contracts over here and
 
00:59:56.750 --> 00:59:56.760 align:start position:0%
and we pay for those contracts through a
 
00:59:59.089 --> 00:59:59.099 align:start position:0%
number of different uh funding sources
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
and so so some of the funding sources
 
01:00:04.789 --> 01:00:04.799 align:start position:0%
are within 78.72
 
01:00:08.150 --> 01:00:08.160 align:start position:0%
and then we have the so the the ssbg the
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
social services block grant out of 92.55
 
01:00:14.510 --> 01:00:14.520 align:start position:0%
and we also use funds from that
 
01:00:16.490 --> 01:00:16.500 align:start position:0%
accounting unit to to pay for those
 
01:00:18.470 --> 01:00:18.480 align:start position:0%
contracts and and so those those
 
01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:20.460 align:start position:0%
contracts the total price limitation of
 
01:00:22.130 --> 01:00:22.140 align:start position:0%
those will have dollars coming from this
 
01:00:25.130 --> 01:00:25.140 align:start position:0%
account and that account so so the the
 
01:00:30.049 --> 01:00:30.059 align:start position:0%
hb2 provision uh section 255
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
um that that that that that still holds
 
01:00:35.270 --> 01:00:35.280 align:start position:0%
true that that would essentially hold
 
01:00:37.370 --> 01:00:37.380 align:start position:0%
those rates at the same rate but that's
 
01:00:39.710 --> 01:00:39.720 align:start position:0%
the relationship between those it's an
 
01:00:42.589 --> 01:00:42.599 align:start position:0%
excellent question though so in order to
 
01:00:44.930 --> 01:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
know how much we're actually spending on
 
01:00:47.630 --> 01:00:47.640 align:start position:0%
this program you have to sort of add
 
01:00:50.950 --> 01:00:50.960 align:start position:0%
those to different categories together
 
01:00:54.589 --> 01:00:54.599 align:start position:0%
as well as House Bill 2. yep I mean
 
01:00:57.230 --> 01:00:57.240 align:start position:0%
another way to think about it too is is
 
01:00:59.210 --> 01:00:59.220 align:start position:0%
we could pull we could pull the
 
01:01:01.010 --> 01:01:01.020 align:start position:0%
contracts that we currently have and
 
01:01:03.109 --> 01:01:03.119 align:start position:0%
those contracts each one has a has a
 
01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:05.099 align:start position:0%
price limitation
 
01:01:07.309 --> 01:01:07.319 align:start position:0%
um that that set that that's a better
 
01:01:09.289 --> 01:01:09.299 align:start position:0%
kind of amalgamation of the numbers that
 
01:01:10.490 --> 01:01:10.500 align:start position:0%
you're seeing here
 
01:01:14.990 --> 01:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:17.809 --> 01:01:17.819 align:start position:0%
all set okay
 
01:01:21.349 --> 01:01:21.359 align:start position:0%
um so we just talked about uh
 
01:01:26.390 --> 01:01:26.400 align:start position:0%
net 9255 at the bottom of 928
 
01:01:28.910 --> 01:01:28.920 align:start position:0%
um and the social services block grant
 
01:01:31.250 --> 01:01:31.260 align:start position:0%
is is a huge component of the funding
 
01:01:33.289 --> 01:01:33.299 align:start position:0%
source for that account
 
01:01:37.670 --> 01:01:37.680 align:start position:0%
the on page 929 the 8925 Medicaid
 
01:01:40.849 --> 01:01:40.859 align:start position:0%
services Grant this is the ship Grant
 
01:01:43.370 --> 01:01:43.380 align:start position:0%
um there's a small required general fund
 
01:01:46.130 --> 01:01:46.140 align:start position:0%
match that the dollar amount is you know
 
01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:49.920 align:start position:0%
roughly 150 000 annually
 
01:01:51.170 --> 01:01:51.180 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there's any questions
 
01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:53.940 align:start position:0%
on the functions of this particular
 
01:01:53.940 --> 01:01:56.530 align:start position:0%
on the functions of this particular
account

01:01:56.530 --> 01:01:56.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:59.930 --> 01:01:59.940 align:start position:0%
representative walner thank you so I I
 
01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:02.760 align:start position:0%
do see under this is a very small a very
 
01:02:05.270 --> 01:02:05.280 align:start position:0%
small area but I see under
 
01:02:09.829 --> 01:02:09.839 align:start position:0%
um 566 the adult group daycare
 
01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:12.720 align:start position:0%
it doesn't look like we
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
have been spending down in that area and
 
01:02:17.450 --> 01:02:17.460 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering is that because the
 
01:02:20.750 --> 01:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
eligibility is so low that
 
01:02:22.849 --> 01:02:22.859 align:start position:0%
there aren't very many clients who need
 
01:02:24.349 --> 01:02:24.359 align:start position:0%
this service
 
01:02:28.130 --> 01:02:28.140 align:start position:0%
this is not it's on page 928 at the
 
01:02:30.049 --> 01:02:30.059 align:start position:0%
bottom of the page
 
01:02:32.630 --> 01:02:32.640 align:start position:0%
do you know that yeah I would say part
 
01:02:34.490 --> 01:02:34.500 align:start position:0%
of that is true and then I think you
 
01:02:36.049 --> 01:02:36.059 align:start position:0%
know we're still seeing the effects of
 
01:02:38.690 --> 01:02:38.700 align:start position:0%
coven so for seniors to be in congregate
 
01:02:41.150 --> 01:02:41.160 align:start position:0%
settings I think we've seen a drop
 
01:02:43.849 --> 01:02:43.859 align:start position:0%
um in seniors wanting to be in that sort
 
01:02:46.370 --> 01:02:46.380 align:start position:0%
of group setting you anticipate that
 
01:02:48.650 --> 01:02:48.660 align:start position:0%
people will start using it again that's
 
01:02:50.150 --> 01:02:50.160 align:start position:0%
what we're hoping you know to support
 
01:02:52.670 --> 01:02:52.680 align:start position:0%
the caregivers um in the community it's
 
01:02:54.650 --> 01:02:54.660 align:start position:0%
a real vital service
 
01:02:56.630 --> 01:02:56.640 align:start position:0%
um so people can continue working as
 
01:02:59.329 --> 01:02:59.339 align:start position:0%
their caregiving for their older family
 
01:03:02.270 --> 01:03:02.280 align:start position:0%
members great thank you and and also
 
01:03:04.849 --> 01:03:04.859 align:start position:0%
just just from a kind of day-to-day
 
01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:07.319 align:start position:0%
process perspective
 
01:03:09.530 --> 01:03:09.540 align:start position:0%
um we you know we we review our expense
 
01:03:11.750 --> 01:03:11.760 align:start position:0%
projections on an ongoing basis and so
 
01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
sometimes if we do see that you know
 
01:03:16.130 --> 01:03:16.140 align:start position:0%
we're we're not projected to use all
 
01:03:17.510 --> 01:03:17.520 align:start position:0%
those funds we will go back through
 
01:03:19.970 --> 01:03:19.980 align:start position:0%
fiscal to repurpose those
 
01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:21.720 align:start position:0%
um for for other pressing needs where
 
01:03:23.510 --> 01:03:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know we do project a potential
 
01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:25.920 align:start position:0%
deficits or or they could be spent in a
 
01:03:26.870 --> 01:03:26.880 align:start position:0%
better way
 
01:03:26.880 --> 01:03:32.170 align:start position:0%
better way
thanks

01:03:32.170 --> 01:03:32.180 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:36.230 --> 01:03:36.240 align:start position:0%
so turning to page
 
01:03:38.270 --> 01:03:38.280 align:start position:0%
um let's see here
 
01:03:41.210 --> 01:03:41.220 align:start position:0%
so actually I think if we go back to the
 
01:03:44.809 --> 01:03:44.819 align:start position:0%
presentation at this point and move to
 
01:03:48.410 --> 01:03:48.420 align:start position:0%
to page 10.
 
01:03:50.390 --> 01:03:50.400 align:start position:0%
um we're we're actually we've actually
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
already started moving into the Bureau
 
01:03:54.410 --> 01:03:54.420 align:start position:0%
of elderly and Adult Services uh just to
 
01:03:57.049 --> 01:03:57.059 align:start position:0%
get everybody oriented
 
01:04:02.270 --> 01:04:02.280 align:start position:0%
um so on um on page 930 we formally had
 
01:04:05.809 --> 01:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
a no wrong door uh Grant this this is
 
01:04:08.510 --> 01:04:08.520 align:start position:0%
since expired and and will be will be
 
01:04:10.670 --> 01:04:10.680 align:start position:0%
going away
 
01:04:13.730 --> 01:04:13.740 align:start position:0%
um at the bottom of page 930 we have the
 
01:04:16.030 --> 01:04:16.040 align:start position:0%
administration on Aging Services Grant
 
01:04:20.210 --> 01:04:20.220 align:start position:0%
this is also a relatively small small
 
01:04:22.309 --> 01:04:22.319 align:start position:0%
dollar figure
 
01:04:24.650 --> 01:04:24.660 align:start position:0%
um and and this and I don't know if you
 
01:04:25.730 --> 01:04:25.740 align:start position:0%
want to speak to the program here
 
01:04:28.309 --> 01:04:28.319 align:start position:0%
Melissa's senior Medicaid sure it's a
 
01:04:28.319 --> 01:04:29.510 align:start position:0%
Melissa's senior Medicaid sure it's a
senior

01:04:29.510 --> 01:04:29.520 align:start position:0%
senior
 
01:04:31.430 --> 01:04:31.440 align:start position:0%
senior troll project so it's a contract
 
01:04:33.049 --> 01:04:33.059 align:start position:0%
with service link
 
01:04:35.210 --> 01:04:35.220 align:start position:0%
um really dedicated to teaching seniors
 
01:04:37.130 --> 01:04:37.140 align:start position:0%
and other people with Medicare to be
 
01:04:39.349 --> 01:04:39.359 align:start position:0%
aware of you know Health Care fraud any
 
01:04:41.690 --> 01:04:41.700 align:start position:0%
sort of schemes that may come so that
 
01:04:43.670 --> 01:04:43.680 align:start position:0%
it'll become victims of Fraud and how to
 
01:04:45.650 --> 01:04:45.660 align:start position:0%
detect any sort of billing errors on
 
01:04:47.750 --> 01:04:47.760 align:start position:0%
your Medicare statement
 
01:04:49.910 --> 01:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
um so that's that program
 
01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:50.690 align:start position:0%
um so that's that program
foreign

01:04:50.690 --> 01:04:50.700 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
01:04:55.430 --> 01:04:55.440 align:start position:0%
on the next page on page 931 this is the
 
01:04:57.770 --> 01:04:57.780 align:start position:0%
Money Follows the person's grant that we
 
01:05:00.890 --> 01:05:00.900 align:start position:0%
talked about earlier and and the the two
 
01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:02.880 align:start position:0%
um temporary positions and and that we
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
had uh had it approved through fiscal uh
 
01:05:07.309 --> 01:05:07.319 align:start position:0%
this past fall and that's a five-year
 
01:05:10.849 --> 01:05:10.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.270 --> 01:05:14.280 align:start position:0%
if you continue to page
 
01:05:16.970 --> 01:05:16.980 align:start position:0%
um 9 32
 
01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:20.460 align:start position:0%
uh we we now get into the uh there's a
 
01:05:22.670 --> 01:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
volunteer activities account uh this
 
01:05:24.289 --> 01:05:24.299 align:start position:0%
this is a hundred percent General funds
 
01:05:26.569 --> 01:05:26.579 align:start position:0%
it's a relatively small program
 
01:05:29.450 --> 01:05:29.460 align:start position:0%
um but but it does pay for a a small
 
01:05:31.490 --> 01:05:31.500 align:start position:0%
stipend and transportation reimbursement
 
01:05:36.589 --> 01:05:36.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:40.789 --> 01:05:40.799 align:start position:0%
on at the bottom of page 932 we get into
 
01:05:43.549 --> 01:05:43.559 align:start position:0%
our our service Link account and I'm
 
01:05:44.990 --> 01:05:45.000 align:start position:0%
going to hand it over to Melissa just to
 
01:05:47.750 --> 01:05:47.760 align:start position:0%
kind of talk about the the program and
 
01:05:49.430 --> 01:05:49.440 align:start position:0%
um the the seven contracts that we have
 
01:05:53.030 --> 01:05:53.040 align:start position:0%
13 locations across the state
 
01:05:55.309 --> 01:05:55.319 align:start position:0%
yes so service link is our state
 
01:05:57.950 --> 01:05:57.960 align:start position:0%
designated aging and disability resource
 
01:05:59.569 --> 01:05:59.579 align:start position:0%
center and I'm sure you might have heard
 
01:06:00.470 --> 01:06:00.480 align:start position:0%
of them
 
01:06:02.089 --> 01:06:02.099 align:start position:0%
um before they're like Nathan said we
 
01:06:03.589 --> 01:06:03.599 align:start position:0%
have seven contracts with different
 
01:06:07.190 --> 01:06:07.200 align:start position:0%

01:06:36.049 --> 01:06:36.059 align:start position:0%
veterans directed CARE program so
 
01:06:36.059 --> 01:06:36.650 align:start position:0%
veterans directed CARE program so
um

01:06:36.650 --> 01:06:36.660 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:06:38.809 --> 01:06:38.819 align:start position:0%
yeah that that's that's service link so
 
01:06:41.690 --> 01:06:41.700 align:start position:0%
kind of a One-Stop shop for folks that
 
01:06:43.549 --> 01:06:43.559 align:start position:0%
can either go in person or make an
 
01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:46.380 align:start position:0%
appointment or a virtual appointment
 
01:06:48.890 --> 01:06:48.900 align:start position:0%
um to see you know what services the
 
01:06:54.289 --> 01:06:54.299 align:start position:0%
state and local communities provide and
 
01:06:58.670 --> 01:06:58.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:00.470 --> 01:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
excellent thank you for the explanation
 
01:07:02.870 --> 01:07:02.880 align:start position:0%
a lot could have been determined from
 
01:07:04.670 --> 01:07:04.680 align:start position:0%
the word service link so it's good to
 
01:07:07.970 --> 01:07:07.980 align:start position:0%
have that clearly detailed out
 
01:07:11.150 --> 01:07:11.160 align:start position:0%
okay and and and the the funding sources
 
01:07:13.549 --> 01:07:13.559 align:start position:0%
for this are are multi-fold they they
 
01:07:15.829 --> 01:07:15.839 align:start position:0%
are listed out in the um in the budget
 
01:07:17.690 --> 01:07:17.700 align:start position:0%
briefing book there's a lot of acronyms
 
01:07:18.890 --> 01:07:18.900 align:start position:0%
I'm more than happy to get any
 
01:07:21.710 --> 01:07:21.720 align:start position:0%
information you need for that
 
01:07:25.970 --> 01:07:25.980 align:start position:0%
uh moving on on page 933 there's the
 
01:07:28.549 --> 01:07:28.559 align:start position:0%
Alzheimer's Related Disorders um this is
 
01:07:30.950 --> 01:07:30.960 align:start position:0%
a hundred percent General funds uh we we
 
01:07:33.710 --> 01:07:33.720 align:start position:0%
have a contract with an Area Agency resp
 
01:07:36.349 --> 01:07:36.359 align:start position:0%
for respite for families
 
01:07:40.930 --> 01:07:40.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.950 --> 01:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:51.770 align:start position:0%
 
here

01:07:51.770 --> 01:07:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:56.520 align:start position:0%
okay if if you move to page 934
 
01:07:59.029 --> 01:07:59.039 align:start position:0%
um we're now moving into into one of the
 
01:08:03.529 --> 01:08:03.539 align:start position:0%
larger accounts uh this is the 2152 so
 
01:08:05.089 --> 01:08:05.099 align:start position:0%
um when when we talk about the county
 
01:08:05.099 --> 01:08:06.410 align:start position:0%
um when when we talk about the county
cap

01:08:06.410 --> 01:08:06.420 align:start position:0%
cap
 
01:08:08.690 --> 01:08:08.700 align:start position:0%
um this is this is the the accounting
 
01:08:11.029 --> 01:08:11.039 align:start position:0%
unit that's impacted
 
01:08:13.250 --> 01:08:13.260 align:start position:0%
um I think I think it's
 
01:08:15.589 --> 01:08:15.599 align:start position:0%
um maybe important to start down below
 
01:08:17.930 --> 01:08:17.940 align:start position:0%
and skip the expenditures and start at
 
01:08:20.390 --> 01:08:20.400 align:start position:0%
the revenues and just talk a little bit
 
01:08:23.749 --> 01:08:23.759 align:start position:0%
about about the funding mechanism here
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
so we we use this account to
 
01:08:31.789 --> 01:08:31.799 align:start position:0%
um to cover the Medicaid costs of
 
01:08:34.309 --> 01:08:34.319 align:start position:0%
individuals that are receiving
 
01:08:34.319 --> 01:08:34.990 align:start position:0%
individuals that are receiving
um

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:35.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:38.930 --> 01:08:38.940 align:start position:0%
services at nursing facilities and there
 
01:08:42.550 --> 01:08:42.560 align:start position:0%
is a um a system in place in statute
 
01:08:45.650 --> 01:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
whereby the the counties make payments
 
01:08:48.050 --> 01:08:48.060 align:start position:0%
uh to the state and there's a cap on the
 
01:08:50.630 --> 01:08:50.640 align:start position:0%
on the level of payment that is made and
 
01:08:52.309 --> 01:08:52.319 align:start position:0%
you'll see those those private local
 
01:08:52.319 --> 01:08:53.689 align:start position:0%
you'll see those those private local
funds

01:08:53.689 --> 01:08:53.699 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:08:55.669 --> 01:08:55.679 align:start position:0%
um when we talk County cap that's what
 
01:08:58.970 --> 01:08:58.980 align:start position:0%
you're seeing there there there is a
 
01:09:02.030 --> 01:09:02.040 align:start position:0%
discrepancy between the figures that are
 
01:09:04.070 --> 01:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
included here and the figures that are
 
01:09:08.630 --> 01:09:08.640 align:start position:0%
included in the hb2 and and I can I can
 
01:09:10.430 --> 01:09:10.440 align:start position:0%
pull that provision up here just so
 
01:09:12.650 --> 01:09:12.660 align:start position:0%
we're all looking at the same thing
 
01:09:18.590 --> 01:09:18.600 align:start position:0%
foreign it's uh page 80 section 233
 
01:09:21.410 --> 01:09:21.420 align:start position:0%
um and and so
 
01:09:23.450 --> 01:09:23.460 align:start position:0%
these these figures should match the
 
01:09:25.849 --> 01:09:25.859 align:start position:0%
figures that are uh identified in RSA
 
01:09:28.430 --> 01:09:28.440 align:start position:0%
167 18a
 
01:09:31.370 --> 01:09:31.380 align:start position:0%
um these numbers should match
 
01:09:34.370 --> 01:09:34.380 align:start position:0%
um and if they were to St and there's
 
01:09:37.070 --> 01:09:37.080 align:start position:0%
there's also a provision within RSA 167
 
01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:38.510 align:start position:0%
there's also a provision within RSA 167
18a

01:09:38.510 --> 01:09:38.520 align:start position:0%
18a
 
01:09:40.490 --> 01:09:40.500 align:start position:0%
that specifies that the county cap
 
01:09:43.070 --> 01:09:43.080 align:start position:0%
should not increase by over two percent
 
01:09:46.430 --> 01:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
each year so if if it were to and and
 
01:09:48.590 --> 01:09:48.600 align:start position:0%
I'll defer to the committee on on their
 
01:09:52.010 --> 01:09:52.020 align:start position:0%
Direction on this if it were to increase
 
01:09:52.020 --> 01:09:52.550 align:start position:0%
Direction on this if it were to increase
um

01:09:52.550 --> 01:09:52.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:55.550 --> 01:09:55.560 align:start position:0%
by two percent each year the figures in
 
01:09:57.770 --> 01:09:57.780 align:start position:0%
24 and 25 and the private local funds
 
01:10:01.070 --> 01:10:01.080 align:start position:0%
would be a 129 million and 131 million
 
01:10:04.010 --> 01:10:04.020 align:start position:0%
and 24 and 25
 
01:10:06.410 --> 01:10:06.420 align:start position:0%
um that that would result in an increase
 
01:10:08.750 --> 01:10:08.760 align:start position:0%
in the general fund uh need by
 
01:10:10.630 --> 01:10:10.640 align:start position:0%
approximately an increase of 2 million
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
uh and
 
01:10:15.350 --> 01:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
um about eight million dollars in state
 
01:10:16.689 --> 01:10:16.699 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
2025. uh the federal funds that you see
 
01:10:21.649 --> 01:10:21.659 align:start position:0%
there those are the Medicaid dollars or
 
01:10:23.510 --> 01:10:23.520 align:start position:0%
the matching Medicaid dollars and then
 
01:10:25.070 --> 01:10:25.080 align:start position:0%
the general funds
 
01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:26.699 align:start position:0%
um those are the the remaining amount
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
that the state puts in
 
01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:34.970 --> 01:10:34.980 align:start position:0%
um now within this in back in the
 
01:10:38.570 --> 01:10:38.580 align:start position:0%
expenditures UC class 504 the nursing
 
01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
home payments um you I believe an
 
01:10:42.649 --> 01:10:42.659 align:start position:0%
organization came up and spoke to you
 
01:10:45.470 --> 01:10:45.480 align:start position:0%
last week about the choices for
 
01:10:49.070 --> 01:10:49.080 align:start position:0%
Independence program and assisted living
 
01:10:52.189 --> 01:10:52.199 align:start position:0%
um within 505 that is the assisted
 
01:10:53.990 --> 01:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
living the home support waiver Services
 
01:10:56.330 --> 01:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
uh that's that's when somebody comes to
 
01:10:58.189 --> 01:10:58.199 align:start position:0%
your to your house to provide assistance
 
01:10:59.630 --> 01:10:59.640 align:start position:0%
and then the Home Health Care Services
 
01:11:03.169 --> 01:11:03.179 align:start position:0%
is more Health Care related Services
 
01:11:06.050 --> 01:11:06.060 align:start position:0%
um so historically those have been or
 
01:11:07.490 --> 01:11:07.500 align:start position:0%
right I don't know if historically is
 
01:11:09.350 --> 01:11:09.360 align:start position:0%
the best word but most recently those
 
01:11:12.590 --> 01:11:12.600 align:start position:0%
figure those the 504 504 or sorry 505
 
01:11:16.189 --> 01:11:16.199 align:start position:0%
506 and 529 account uh class lines those
 
01:11:18.530 --> 01:11:18.540 align:start position:0%
have been budgeted separately the
 
01:11:20.689 --> 01:11:20.699 align:start position:0%
department was proposing and and we're
 
01:11:22.850 --> 01:11:22.860 align:start position:0%
fine with it one way or another we were
 
01:11:25.310 --> 01:11:25.320 align:start position:0%
proposing to combine those class lines
 
01:11:27.350 --> 01:11:27.360 align:start position:0%
into a single account the reason for
 
01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120 align:start position:0%
that is partly behind this there's
 
01:11:31.850 --> 01:11:31.860 align:start position:0%
there's several
 
01:11:34.010 --> 01:11:34.020 align:start position:0%
um I believe what was alluded to was the
 
01:11:35.330 --> 01:11:35.340 align:start position:0%
process of having to go back through
 
01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
fiscal to make adjustments
 
01:11:40.130 --> 01:11:40.140 align:start position:0%
um from an administrative perspective uh
 
01:11:43.610 --> 01:11:43.620 align:start position:0%
we we basically we we have to make that
 
01:11:45.890 --> 01:11:45.900 align:start position:0%
determination a month approximately
 
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
about a month in advance of coming to
 
01:11:49.550 --> 01:11:49.560 align:start position:0%
fiscal uh the reason that we were
 
01:11:51.229 --> 01:11:51.239 align:start position:0%
requesting this was not necessarily
 
01:11:52.910 --> 01:11:52.920 align:start position:0%
because of the administrative burden of
 
01:11:56.570 --> 01:11:56.580 align:start position:0%
that but more so because uh our I.T
 
01:11:59.689 --> 01:11:59.699 align:start position:0%
systems we have had scenarios where
 
01:12:02.209 --> 01:12:02.219 align:start position:0%
um we've run out of money in one account
 
01:12:04.669 --> 01:12:04.679 align:start position:0%
and we're not able to get through fiscal
 
01:12:06.229 --> 01:12:06.239 align:start position:0%
fast enough because there may be a month
 
01:12:08.149 --> 01:12:08.159 align:start position:0%
or three week delay
 
01:12:09.890 --> 01:12:09.900 align:start position:0%
um in order in order to transfer those
 
01:12:12.050 --> 01:12:12.060 align:start position:0%
funds so that was part of the reason
 
01:12:14.090 --> 01:12:14.100 align:start position:0%
behind that request and we'll defer to
 
01:12:15.649 --> 01:12:15.659 align:start position:0%
the committee's judgment on on what the
 
01:12:17.630 --> 01:12:17.640 align:start position:0%
best direction is because I I also
 
01:12:19.130 --> 01:12:19.140 align:start position:0%
recognize that you know we have to take
 
01:12:20.750 --> 01:12:20.760 align:start position:0%
into account the public transparency
 
01:12:22.370 --> 01:12:22.380 align:start position:0%
perspective it's just that behind the
 
01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.390 align:start position:0%
perspective it's just that behind the
scenes

01:12:23.390 --> 01:12:23.400 align:start position:0%
scenes
 
01:12:25.130 --> 01:12:25.140 align:start position:0%
um we do have some I.T challenges that
 
01:12:28.189 --> 01:12:28.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:30.470 --> 01:12:30.480 align:start position:0%
good to know of course question
 
01:12:32.750 --> 01:12:32.760 align:start position:0%
representative erf her question
 
01:12:34.850 --> 01:12:34.860 align:start position:0%
so not necessarily directly related to
 
01:12:35.990 --> 01:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
that although that does concern anything
 
01:12:39.229 --> 01:12:39.239 align:start position:0%
that's that separating things out but if
 
01:12:43.250 --> 01:12:43.260 align:start position:0%
I understand correctly line 506 also
 
01:12:44.870 --> 01:12:44.880 align:start position:0%
includes Meals on Wheels and Adult Day
 
01:12:49.870 --> 01:12:49.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:54.290 --> 01:12:54.300 align:start position:0%
yeah so 506 is um for CFI so things like
 
01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:56.760 align:start position:0%
Adult Day supported housing
 
01:12:59.630 --> 01:12:59.640 align:start position:0%
um non-medical Transportation I don't
 
01:13:02.530 --> 01:13:02.540 align:start position:0%
believe Meals on Wheels
 
01:13:05.930 --> 01:13:05.940 align:start position:0%
yes so also Meals on Wheels would be
 
01:13:09.470 --> 01:13:09.480 align:start position:0%
included in that CFI line 506. so this
 
01:13:09.480 --> 01:13:10.610 align:start position:0%
included in that CFI line 506. so this
is

01:13:10.610 --> 01:13:10.620 align:start position:0%
is
 
01:13:13.070 --> 01:13:13.080 align:start position:0%
the counties providing meals on wheels
 
01:13:14.930 --> 01:13:14.940 align:start position:0%
so how does this Meals on Wheels tie in
 
01:13:16.729 --> 01:13:16.739 align:start position:0%
with all the other meals and wheels
 
01:13:22.189 --> 01:13:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:24.470 --> 01:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
so this would be the Medicaid waiver
 
01:13:26.330 --> 01:13:26.340 align:start position:0%
service under
 
01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:28.080 align:start position:0%
um this choices for Independence program
 
01:13:30.169 --> 01:13:30.179 align:start position:0%
so a little bit different than how the
 
01:13:33.229 --> 01:13:33.239 align:start position:0%
other Meals on Wheels programs are
 
01:13:34.850 --> 01:13:34.860 align:start position:0%
determined they could be determined
 
01:13:37.570 --> 01:13:37.580 align:start position:0%
based on interaction with servicelink
 
01:13:40.729 --> 01:13:40.739 align:start position:0%
but this specifically is for the
 
01:13:44.209 --> 01:13:44.219 align:start position:0%
Medicaid waiver CFI uh program I guess
 
01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:46.080 align:start position:0%
what I'm trying to understand is these
 
01:13:47.330 --> 01:13:47.340 align:start position:0%
are all meals and wheels programs being
 
01:13:49.430 --> 01:13:49.440 align:start position:0%
delivered to people
 
01:13:51.169 --> 01:13:51.179 align:start position:0%
are they the same people in different
 
01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:54.120 align:start position:0%
programs sometimes how is this all
 
01:13:58.669 --> 01:13:58.679 align:start position:0%
no yeah so some um to be on CFI you have
 
01:14:00.830 --> 01:14:00.840 align:start position:0%
to be Medicaid eligible and then some of
 
01:14:02.990 --> 01:14:03.000 align:start position:0%
the other programs that provide Meals on
 
01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
Wheels there's an income um level and
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
um you're not Medicaid eligible so so I
 
01:14:11.990 --> 01:14:12.000 align:start position:0%
understand that but how is that tracks
 
01:14:14.149 --> 01:14:14.159 align:start position:0%
we don't you're not living this meals
 
01:14:20.090 --> 01:14:20.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:23.030 --> 01:14:23.040 align:start position:0%
I I would say that you know for CFI we
 
01:14:25.430 --> 01:14:25.440 align:start position:0%
have Case Management Services that
 
01:14:28.250 --> 01:14:28.260 align:start position:0%
really look at the assessed need of the
 
01:14:29.990 --> 01:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
person and so
 
01:14:31.970 --> 01:14:31.980 align:start position:0%
um you know I think we would be able to
 
01:14:33.290 --> 01:14:33.300 align:start position:0%
figure out
 
01:14:35.570 --> 01:14:35.580 align:start position:0%
you know if somebody again somebody not
 
01:14:37.729 --> 01:14:37.739 align:start position:0%
on Medicaid wouldn't be able to access
 
01:14:40.729 --> 01:14:40.739 align:start position:0%
these Meals on Wheels in 506 because
 
01:14:43.550 --> 01:14:43.560 align:start position:0%
they have to have Medicaid to get CFI
 
01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:48.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
the other way around so she said the
 
01:14:51.890 --> 01:14:51.900 align:start position:0%
ones that are on Medicaid wouldn't be
 
01:14:53.570 --> 01:14:53.580 align:start position:0%
able to get it but their way around
 
01:14:55.550 --> 01:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
so you you've got three pots of money
 
01:14:57.290 --> 01:14:57.300 align:start position:0%
here it sounds like at least I don't
 
01:14:58.310 --> 01:14:58.320 align:start position:0%
know maybe there's more in this budget
 
01:15:00.490 --> 01:15:00.500 align:start position:0%
question mark
 
01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:03.300 align:start position:0%
no no in in the whole budget are there
 
01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:04.920 align:start position:0%
we've encountered three places where
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
meals and wheels are so far just this
 
01:15:09.649 --> 01:15:09.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:12.530 --> 01:15:12.540 align:start position:0%
there there may be individuals accessing
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
meals through fundraising at the agency
 
01:15:16.930 --> 01:15:16.940 align:start position:0%
level okay
 
01:15:18.890 --> 01:15:18.900 align:start position:0%
but that wouldn't be
 
01:15:21.169 --> 01:15:21.179 align:start position:0%
okay so for these three I'm just trying
 
01:15:22.130 --> 01:15:22.140 align:start position:0%
to understand it so we're talking about
 
01:15:24.890 --> 01:15:24.900 align:start position:0%
a lot of money right I mean
 
01:15:26.390 --> 01:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
I don't know what that total is but it's
 
01:15:27.770 --> 01:15:27.780 align:start position:0%
a lot
 
01:15:29.090 --> 01:15:29.100 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious how this is all
 
01:15:29.100 --> 01:15:30.290 align:start position:0%
um I'm just curious how this is all
coordinated

01:15:30.290 --> 01:15:30.300 align:start position:0%
coordinated
 
01:15:32.090 --> 01:15:32.100 align:start position:0%
do we really need all those pots of
 
01:15:34.010 --> 01:15:34.020 align:start position:0%
money all that money that's in all those
 
01:15:37.330 --> 01:15:37.340 align:start position:0%
pots or some of those pots duplicative
 
01:15:40.850 --> 01:15:40.860 align:start position:0%
we the at the agency level they'll track
 
01:15:43.370 --> 01:15:43.380 align:start position:0%
and transition people so if somebody's
 
01:15:45.830 --> 01:15:45.840 align:start position:0%
been getting meals for a couple of years
 
01:15:47.689 --> 01:15:47.699 align:start position:0%
through our older American psych
 
01:15:49.729 --> 01:15:49.739 align:start position:0%
services and then they transition or
 
01:15:52.430 --> 01:15:52.440 align:start position:0%
become eligible for Medicaid
 
01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
um through the CFI program they're the
 
01:15:56.810 --> 01:15:56.820 align:start position:0%
payer source for their meal would change
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
but they would continue to get the meal
 
01:16:00.350 --> 01:16:00.360 align:start position:0%
they had always been get so you're
 
01:16:02.830 --> 01:16:02.840 align:start position:0%
you're depending on the providers to
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
let me ask it this way do you have a
 
01:16:19.430 --> 01:16:19.440 align:start position:0%
database a lot of people getting Meals
 
01:16:26.930 --> 01:16:26.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:28.550 --> 01:16:28.560 align:start position:0%
okay and you have any ability to
 
01:16:29.750 --> 01:16:29.760 align:start position:0%
actually cross-check them to see if
 
01:16:38.330 --> 01:16:38.340 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:40.850 --> 01:16:40.860 align:start position:0%
to pull reports and combine the data to
 
01:16:42.770 --> 01:16:42.780 align:start position:0%
to check and see if there may be a
 
01:16:45.169 --> 01:16:45.179 align:start position:0%
transition do you ever do that
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
we do that we do do that on occasion
 
01:16:49.370 --> 01:16:49.380 align:start position:0%
okay I'd be curious to see that cross
 
01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:51.110 align:start position:0%
okay I'd be curious to see that cross
checks

01:16:51.110 --> 01:16:51.120 align:start position:0%
checks
 
01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:56.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:58.729 --> 01:16:58.739 align:start position:0%
Altman and I'm the bureau chief of the
 
01:17:00.649 --> 01:17:00.659 align:start position:0%
Bureau of elderly and Adult Services
 
01:17:06.229 --> 01:17:06.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
01:17:10.310 --> 01:17:10.320 align:start position:0%
um following up
 
01:17:12.830 --> 01:17:12.840 align:start position:0%
um yeah I I'm not sure 100 I want to
 
01:17:14.810 --> 01:17:14.820 align:start position:0%
make sure I understood what you meant by
 
01:17:17.209 --> 01:17:17.219 align:start position:0%
cap to County
 
01:17:19.790 --> 01:17:19.800 align:start position:0%
um services so there's a maximum amount
 
01:17:23.770 --> 01:17:23.780 align:start position:0%
of of uh funds available to support
 
01:17:27.649 --> 01:17:27.659 align:start position:0%
nursing home uh bound patients at the
 
01:17:29.530 --> 01:17:29.540 align:start position:0%
county level
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
is so
 
01:17:34.910 --> 01:17:34.920 align:start position:0%
um let's say the counties end up having
 
01:17:37.790 --> 01:17:37.800 align:start position:0%
20 percent more patients than they they
 
01:17:40.250 --> 01:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
projected you would still be capped at
 
01:17:42.530 --> 01:17:42.540 align:start position:0%
the same amount so essentially you would
 
01:17:45.470 --> 01:17:45.480 align:start position:0%
have paid less per person or exactly
 
01:17:48.770 --> 01:17:48.780 align:start position:0%
what does that mean sure so and and also
 
01:17:52.010 --> 01:17:52.020 align:start position:0%
just to clarify so so these payments are
 
01:17:54.110 --> 01:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
are for for the nursing facilities I
 
01:17:56.510 --> 01:17:56.520 align:start position:0%
believe there's approximately 71 across
 
01:17:58.550 --> 01:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
the state not not the County nursing
 
01:17:58.560 --> 01:18:01.430 align:start position:0%
the state not not the County nursing
facilities

01:18:01.430 --> 01:18:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:06.830 --> 01:18:06.840 align:start position:0%
um so so the the 132 million that's in
 
01:18:08.450 --> 01:18:08.460 align:start position:0%
the governor's recommended budget right
 
01:18:11.209 --> 01:18:11.219 align:start position:0%
now that's the that's the the maximum
 
01:18:13.370 --> 01:18:13.380 align:start position:0%
amount that the county would contribute
 
01:18:15.290 --> 01:18:15.300 align:start position:0%
to this so basically on a monthly basis
 
01:18:17.870 --> 01:18:17.880 align:start position:0%
the counties each make payment to DHHS
 
01:18:19.910 --> 01:18:19.920 align:start position:0%
we take that we match it with the
 
01:18:22.430 --> 01:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
federal dollars and draw those down
 
01:18:26.450 --> 01:18:26.460 align:start position:0%
um for those payments um there are uh
 
01:18:29.930 --> 01:18:29.940 align:start position:0%
the the mqip and pro share accounts that
 
01:18:31.669 --> 01:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
that are to come those are supplemental
 
01:18:31.679 --> 01:18:32.870 align:start position:0%
that are to come those are supplemental
payments

01:18:32.870 --> 01:18:32.880 align:start position:0%
payments
 
01:18:34.070 --> 01:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
um to the counties I can see
 
01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
representative Earth is ready to talk
 
01:18:38.450 --> 01:18:38.460 align:start position:0%
about that um but
 
01:18:40.250 --> 01:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
um that so so those are the payments
 
01:18:42.169 --> 01:18:42.179 align:start position:0%
that go to the County nursing homes I
 
01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:43.020 align:start position:0%
think that's just an important
 
01:18:45.350 --> 01:18:45.360 align:start position:0%
distinction to make here
 
01:18:47.570 --> 01:18:47.580 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:49.910 --> 01:18:49.920 align:start position:0%
representative Wallner for question
 
01:18:53.510 --> 01:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
I just wondered if you could once again
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
why are the
 
01:18:57.830 --> 01:18:57.840 align:start position:0%
I think you went over this but
 
01:19:00.229 --> 01:19:00.239 align:start position:0%
the county cap is always for me at least
 
01:19:04.010 --> 01:19:04.020 align:start position:0%
hard to really get hold of but why is
 
01:19:07.729 --> 01:19:07.739 align:start position:0%
the are the figures in
 
01:19:11.330 --> 01:19:11.340 align:start position:0%
the budget different from
 
01:19:17.149 --> 01:19:17.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:19.850 --> 01:19:19.860 align:start position:0%
um that is a great question
 
01:19:22.910 --> 01:19:22.920 align:start position:0%
um I I I guess I would I would answer
 
01:19:25.250 --> 01:19:25.260 align:start position:0%
with um please let me know what you
 
01:19:26.810 --> 01:19:26.820 align:start position:0%
would like us to do with that we will
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
Rectify that and submit a change request
 
01:19:29.100 --> 01:19:36.590 align:start position:0%
Rectify that and submit a change request
foreign

01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:40.020 align:start position:0%
doubt that I the county Camp is always
 
01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:42.709 align:start position:0%
doubt that I the county Camp is always
interesting

01:19:42.709 --> 01:19:42.719 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
and just to add to that I'll have you
 
01:19:46.310 --> 01:19:46.320 align:start position:0%
know in discussions about House Bill 2
 
01:19:48.709 --> 01:19:48.719 align:start position:0%
one of the first things that comes up is
 
01:19:52.250 --> 01:19:52.260 align:start position:0%
the famous County Camp so it sounds like
 
01:19:54.050 --> 01:19:54.060 align:start position:0%
we're touching on the tip of an iceberg
 
01:19:56.750 --> 01:19:56.760 align:start position:0%
here and we understand and I think
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
that's been made very clear that we have
 
01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:01.260 align:start position:0%
some work to do on that topic
 
01:20:03.709 --> 01:20:03.719 align:start position:0%
and and our the the agency budget
 
01:20:05.870 --> 01:20:05.880 align:start position:0%
request um that we submitted for the 24
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
and 25 biennia um that that that's based
 
01:20:11.090 --> 01:20:11.100 align:start position:0%
on the two percent figures so the 129
 
01:20:13.149 --> 01:20:13.159 align:start position:0%
million and 131
 
01:20:15.350 --> 01:20:15.360 align:start position:0%
being approximate
 
01:20:16.910 --> 01:20:16.920 align:start position:0%
um that that we had included there
 
01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:23.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.940 --> 01:20:25.010 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:20:25.010 --> 01:20:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:28.430 --> 01:20:28.440 align:start position:0%
now there are there are a couple of
 
01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:30.840 align:start position:0%
um class nodes here
 
01:20:33.530 --> 01:20:33.540 align:start position:0%
that that I I think are important just
 
01:20:33.540 --> 01:20:34.610 align:start position:0%
that that I I think are important just
to

01:20:34.610 --> 01:20:34.620 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:20:38.330 --> 01:20:38.340 align:start position:0%
um just to talk about the the first one
 
01:20:42.470 --> 01:20:42.480 align:start position:0%
it was new for the current biennium
 
01:20:45.649 --> 01:20:45.659 align:start position:0%
um and what that did was was essentially
 
01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:47.820 align:start position:0%
if if there are funds left over we shall
 
01:20:50.750 --> 01:20:50.760 align:start position:0%
make a lump sum payment we've we've
 
01:20:52.610 --> 01:20:52.620 align:start position:0%
engaged just to make the committee aware
 
01:20:54.110 --> 01:20:54.120 align:start position:0%
we have engaged with the federal
 
01:20:56.630 --> 01:20:56.640 align:start position:0%
government on how this could work
 
01:20:59.209 --> 01:20:59.219 align:start position:0%
because traditionally
 
01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:01.260 align:start position:0%
um in order to draw down the federal
 
01:21:03.169 --> 01:21:03.179 align:start position:0%
funds we have to have the service that
 
01:21:05.689 --> 01:21:05.699 align:start position:0%
was provided this is a little different
 
01:21:07.189 --> 01:21:07.199 align:start position:0%
and we're still trying to figure out
 
01:21:09.950 --> 01:21:09.960 align:start position:0%
whether we can actually effectuate
 
01:21:12.050 --> 01:21:12.060 align:start position:0%
um the intent of this original class
 
01:21:13.790 --> 01:21:13.800 align:start position:0%
note we're still waiting to hear back
 
01:21:15.950 --> 01:21:15.960 align:start position:0%
from the feds as to whether this is
 
01:21:18.890 --> 01:21:18.900 align:start position:0%
feasible or not I hope to have some some
 
01:21:21.669 --> 01:21:21.679 align:start position:0%
rectification on that issue here soon
 
01:21:24.590 --> 01:21:24.600 align:start position:0%
representative erf for question so are
 
01:21:26.750 --> 01:21:26.760 align:start position:0%
these notes new or were these in the
 
01:21:29.689 --> 01:21:29.699 align:start position:0%
current budget as well these are in the
 
01:21:31.850 --> 01:21:31.860 align:start position:0%
current budget for for this I apologize
 
01:21:33.590 --> 01:21:33.600 align:start position:0%
I misspoke these are in the current
 
01:21:36.590 --> 01:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
budget HP one operating budget today not
 
01:21:39.590 --> 01:21:39.600 align:start position:0%
get that yeah but this is HP one but the
 
01:21:42.169 --> 01:21:42.179 align:start position:0%
current budget biennium are they in that
 
01:21:43.850 --> 01:21:43.860 align:start position:0%
one yes okay thank you
 
01:21:47.510 --> 01:21:47.520 align:start position:0%
and and this language is is uh is
 
01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:56.830 --> 01:21:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:59.030 --> 01:21:59.040 align:start position:0%
there is is that we're not allowed to
 
01:22:00.830 --> 01:22:00.840 align:start position:0%
consider any of these class lines for
 
01:22:02.689 --> 01:22:02.699 align:start position:0%
Budget reductions we can't transfer out
 
01:22:04.729 --> 01:22:04.739 align:start position:0%
of this to to cover shortfalls in other
 
01:22:07.970 --> 01:22:07.980 align:start position:0%
areas so
 
01:22:09.950 --> 01:22:09.960 align:start position:0%
um okay
 
01:22:14.090 --> 01:22:14.100 align:start position:0%
turning to account 2154 uh nursing
 
01:22:14.100 --> 01:22:15.290 align:start position:0%
turning to account 2154 uh nursing
services

01:22:15.290 --> 01:22:15.300 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:22:19.729 --> 01:22:19.739 align:start position:0%
so this account is primarily
 
01:22:25.030 --> 01:22:25.040 align:start position:0%
um 50 50 Medicaid they're in class 509
 
01:22:28.370 --> 01:22:28.380 align:start position:0%
other nursing Services
 
01:22:30.050 --> 01:22:30.060 align:start position:0%
um there are four hundred thousand
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
dollars of General funds that do not
 
01:22:35.209 --> 01:22:35.219 align:start position:0%
have a federal match that are for LNA
 
01:22:37.330 --> 01:22:37.340 align:start position:0%
Workforce Development
 
01:22:40.490 --> 01:22:40.500 align:start position:0%
otherwise these are payments that are
 
01:22:43.130 --> 01:22:43.140 align:start position:0%
made for a community in the Blind and
 
01:22:44.990 --> 01:22:45.000 align:start position:0%
Cedar Crest and also I don't know if you
 
01:22:46.189 --> 01:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
want to speak to that
 
01:22:49.189 --> 01:22:49.199 align:start position:0%
yeah so Cedar Crest is our only
 
01:22:52.370 --> 01:22:52.380 align:start position:0%
Intermediate Care Facility for kids that
 
01:22:55.189 --> 01:22:55.199 align:start position:0%
are have a developmental or
 
01:22:57.229 --> 01:22:57.239 align:start position:0%
intellectually disabled
 
01:22:58.729 --> 01:22:58.739 align:start position:0%
um that need a higher level of care
 
01:22:58.739 --> 01:22:59.870 align:start position:0%
um that need a higher level of care
medically

01:22:59.870 --> 01:22:59.880 align:start position:0%
medically
 
01:23:01.189 --> 01:23:01.199 align:start position:0%
um so they have about I think they have
 
01:23:04.070 --> 01:23:04.080 align:start position:0%
26 Feds that are dedicated
 
01:23:05.390 --> 01:23:05.400 align:start position:0%
um for
 
01:23:07.850 --> 01:23:07.860 align:start position:0%
um for ICF for children with
 
01:23:09.590 --> 01:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities that have
 
01:23:20.870 --> 01:23:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.270 --> 01:23:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:26.280 --> 01:23:27.470 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:23:27.470 --> 01:23:27.480 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:23:31.189 --> 01:23:31.199 align:start position:0%
so on page uh 2157
 
01:23:34.130 --> 01:23:34.140 align:start position:0%
um these are these are the uh mqip
 
01:23:36.850 --> 01:23:36.860 align:start position:0%
payments which also continue on to page
 
01:23:43.370 --> 01:23:43.380 align:start position:0%
uh 937 in um in account uh 2161 and I'm
 
01:23:45.229 --> 01:23:45.239 align:start position:0%
gonna ask Henry Littman just to come up
 
01:23:47.209 --> 01:23:47.219 align:start position:0%
and give folks an overview just because
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
he's the resident expert here and I
 
01:23:50.930 --> 01:23:50.940 align:start position:0%
won't pretend to be what I'm not so hang
 
01:23:52.430 --> 01:23:52.440 align:start position:0%
on one second
 
01:23:52.440 --> 01:24:18.530 align:start position:0%
on one second
foreign

01:24:18.530 --> 01:24:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:18.540 --> 01:24:21.649 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:24:21.649 --> 01:24:21.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:23.930 --> 01:24:23.940 align:start position:0%
so probably good afternoon I've been
 
01:24:26.090 --> 01:24:26.100 align:start position:0%
mourning usually um Henry Lipman the
 
01:24:28.490 --> 01:24:28.500 align:start position:0%
Medicaid director uh
 
01:24:30.950 --> 01:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
it might be a good just to provide a
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
high level of what we're looking at here
 
01:24:35.030 --> 01:24:35.040 align:start position:0%
before we delve into the numbers
 
01:24:37.130 --> 01:24:37.140 align:start position:0%
um see representative Earth's smiling
 
01:24:38.870 --> 01:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
we've spent a few phone calls on this in
 
01:24:40.130 --> 01:24:40.140 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:24:41.990 --> 01:24:42.000 align:start position:0%
um so
 
01:24:44.510 --> 01:24:44.520 align:start position:0%
the system for paying for nursing
 
01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:46.860 align:start position:0%
facilities is really comprised of three
 
01:24:50.270 --> 01:24:50.280 align:start position:0%
key components there's a a rate a daily
 
01:24:50.280 --> 01:24:52.209 align:start position:0%
key components there's a a rate a daily
rate

01:24:52.209 --> 01:24:52.219 align:start position:0%
rate
 
01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:55.560 align:start position:0%
Which is less than the nursing homes
 
01:24:58.370 --> 01:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
cost of providing the service
 
01:25:00.890 --> 01:25:00.900 align:start position:0%
and then added to that for County
 
01:25:00.900 --> 01:25:03.290 align:start position:0%
and then added to that for County
facilities

01:25:03.290 --> 01:25:03.300 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
01:25:05.330 --> 01:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
um and for
 
01:25:08.390 --> 01:25:08.400 align:start position:0%
um non-county facilities the privates is
 
01:25:10.189 --> 01:25:10.199 align:start position:0%
what we call a Medicaid quality
 
01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:11.760 align:start position:0%
incentive payment
 
01:25:16.310 --> 01:25:16.320 align:start position:0%
and that is the funding behind that
 
01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:25:20.750 --> 01:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
um called the nfqa nursing facility
 
01:25:22.310 --> 01:25:22.320 align:start position:0%
quality assessment
 
01:25:26.270 --> 01:25:26.280 align:start position:0%
tax which is applied to the net Patient
 
01:25:30.410 --> 01:25:30.420 align:start position:0%
Service revenues for a a prior period
 
01:25:33.310 --> 01:25:33.320 align:start position:0%
um and that generates
 
01:25:36.290 --> 01:25:36.300 align:start position:0%
dollars that allow us to draw a federal
 
01:25:40.610 --> 01:25:40.620 align:start position:0%
match and so the the assessment that's
 
01:25:44.030 --> 01:25:44.040 align:start position:0%
paid plus the federal match is then used
 
01:25:45.410 --> 01:25:45.420 align:start position:0%
to make up some of the difference
 
01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:46.630 align:start position:0%
to make up some of the difference
between

01:25:46.630 --> 01:25:46.640 align:start position:0%
between
 
01:25:49.689 --> 01:25:49.699 align:start position:0%
what the nursing homes
 
01:25:54.350 --> 01:25:54.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:56.810 --> 01:25:56.820 align:start position:0%
um the payment so it's really if you
 
01:25:59.990 --> 01:26:00.000 align:start position:0%
will daily rate plus M quip helps to
 
01:26:01.970 --> 01:26:01.980 align:start position:0%
close that Gap
 
01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:03.169 align:start position:0%
close that Gap
um

01:26:03.169 --> 01:26:03.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:06.169 --> 01:26:06.179 align:start position:0%
and so that's this part of a the budget
 
01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:08.580 align:start position:0%
is the mqip which is the part that all
 
01:26:10.930 --> 01:26:10.940 align:start position:0%
nursing facilities get to participate in
 
01:26:13.370 --> 01:26:13.380 align:start position:0%
during the federal Public Health
 
01:26:13.380 --> 01:26:14.530 align:start position:0%
during the federal Public Health
Emergency

01:26:14.530 --> 01:26:14.540 align:start position:0%
Emergency
 
01:26:17.870 --> 01:26:17.880 align:start position:0%
which is ending May 11th
 
01:26:17.880 --> 01:26:18.910 align:start position:0%
which is ending May 11th
um

01:26:18.910 --> 01:26:18.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:21.950 --> 01:26:21.960 align:start position:0%
there's been an enhancement to that
 
01:26:24.470 --> 01:26:24.480 align:start position:0%
Federal match which the state has passed
 
01:26:28.970 --> 01:26:28.980 align:start position:0%
on to providers that uh uh probably I
 
01:26:31.010 --> 01:26:31.020 align:start position:0%
think the the current quarterly payment
 
01:26:34.310 --> 01:26:34.320 align:start position:0%
will reflect the 6.2 percent
 
01:26:36.110 --> 01:26:36.120 align:start position:0%
um the next quarterly payment this is
 
01:26:38.209 --> 01:26:38.219 align:start position:0%
paid on a quarterly basis we'll we'll
 
01:26:40.430 --> 01:26:40.440 align:start position:0%
reflect the five percent enhancement
 
01:26:43.010 --> 01:26:43.020 align:start position:0%
then the following quarter will be two
 
01:26:45.410 --> 01:26:45.420 align:start position:0%
and a half percent and then by year end
 
01:26:47.030 --> 01:26:47.040 align:start position:0%
it'll be down to one and a half percent
 
01:26:49.070 --> 01:26:49.080 align:start position:0%
and then it'll be back to that 50 50
 
01:26:49.080 --> 01:26:50.990 align:start position:0%
and then it'll be back to that 50 50
match

01:26:50.990 --> 01:26:51.000 align:start position:0%
match
 
01:26:53.870 --> 01:26:53.880 align:start position:0%
so that's that's mqip
 
01:26:58.610 --> 01:26:58.620 align:start position:0%
or our County facilities which tend to
 
01:27:02.570 --> 01:27:02.580 align:start position:0%
um have a a different type of pyramix in
 
01:27:04.810 --> 01:27:04.820 align:start position:0%
terms of the types of patients uh
 
01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:07.260 align:start position:0%
there's also an additional payment
 
01:27:10.010 --> 01:27:10.020 align:start position:0%
called Pro share which is later in the
 
01:27:12.830 --> 01:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
budget but that's intended to fill in
 
01:27:15.050 --> 01:27:15.060 align:start position:0%
more of the gap for the County nursing
 
01:27:18.110 --> 01:27:18.120 align:start position:0%
facilities that being said the all three
 
01:27:19.970 --> 01:27:19.980 align:start position:0%
of those payments do not necessarily
 
01:27:23.209 --> 01:27:23.219 align:start position:0%
cover the full cost of of covering for a
 
01:27:25.310 --> 01:27:25.320 align:start position:0%
Medicaid patient but that's sort of a
 
01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.080 align:start position:0%
starting point I see representative yes
 
01:27:31.430 --> 01:27:31.440 align:start position:0%
will you yield to questions yes your
 
01:27:33.169 --> 01:27:33.179 align:start position:0%
knowledge is so interesting we could
 
01:27:34.910 --> 01:27:34.920 align:start position:0%
listen to you all day but we do have a
 
01:27:36.709 --> 01:27:36.719 align:start position:0%
question in between representative erf
 
01:27:38.450 --> 01:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
for a question just a quick confirmation
 
01:27:41.450 --> 01:27:41.460 align:start position:0%
you've told me this before this tax is
 
01:27:43.970 --> 01:27:43.980 align:start position:0%
bed tax is is on nursing home days or
 
01:27:46.430 --> 01:27:46.440 align:start position:0%
it's a nursing home revenues revenues
 
01:27:48.169 --> 01:27:48.179 align:start position:0%
okay thank you it's based on net Patient
 
01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:57.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:59.570 --> 01:27:59.580 align:start position:0%
so the you know I think the the
 
01:28:03.110 --> 01:28:03.120 align:start position:0%
estimates here are based on the you know
 
01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.209 align:start position:0%
estimates here are based on the you know
estimated

01:28:05.209 --> 01:28:05.219 align:start position:0%
estimated
 
01:28:07.370 --> 01:28:07.380 align:start position:0%
net Patient Service revenues that are
 
01:28:10.129 --> 01:28:10.139 align:start position:0%
occur that occur and I think that when
 
01:28:13.010 --> 01:28:13.020 align:start position:0%
it comes time to uh actually
 
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
the tax to be paid and the tax has to be
 
01:28:18.350 --> 01:28:18.360 align:start position:0%
paid before the the match can be drawn
 
01:28:20.810 --> 01:28:20.820 align:start position:0%
so there's a gap between the nursing
 
01:28:22.430 --> 01:28:22.440 align:start position:0%
facilities putting out the dollars and
 
01:28:24.350 --> 01:28:24.360 align:start position:0%
and then getting the payment we try to
 
01:28:26.090 --> 01:28:26.100 align:start position:0%
keep that as short as possible by
 
01:28:28.250 --> 01:28:28.260 align:start position:0%
coordinating very closely
 
01:28:30.850 --> 01:28:30.860 align:start position:0%
um but there there is a little uh it's
 
01:28:33.410 --> 01:28:33.420 align:start position:0%
typically days or not more than a couple
 
01:28:36.470 --> 01:28:36.480 align:start position:0%
of weeks is kind of what we aim for
 
01:28:36.480 --> 01:28:37.310 align:start position:0%
of weeks is kind of what we aim for
um

01:28:37.310 --> 01:28:37.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:28:39.649 --> 01:28:39.659 align:start position:0%
and so I guess the the numbers here
 
01:28:42.410 --> 01:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
reflect sort of our best estimates now
 
01:28:45.050 --> 01:28:45.060 align:start position:0%
how these numbers in in practice may
 
01:28:47.209 --> 01:28:47.219 align:start position:0%
vary is that
 
01:28:50.209 --> 01:28:50.219 align:start position:0%
um particularly the the pro share
 
01:28:51.950 --> 01:28:51.960 align:start position:0%
payment because that sort of fills in
 
01:28:55.070 --> 01:28:55.080 align:start position:0%
that third Gap is that
 
01:28:57.229 --> 01:28:57.239 align:start position:0%
um nursing facilities
 
01:28:58.610 --> 01:28:58.620 align:start position:0%
their rate
 
01:29:01.910 --> 01:29:01.920 align:start position:0%
plus the the M grip plus the pro share
 
01:29:05.290 --> 01:29:05.300 align:start position:0%
can be no higher than their Medicaid 100
 
01:29:08.570 --> 01:29:08.580 align:start position:0%
costs and so
 
01:29:12.350 --> 01:29:12.360 align:start position:0%
um if a rate increase is provided and
 
01:29:14.390 --> 01:29:14.400 align:start position:0%
that's higher than their their cost
 
01:29:17.149 --> 01:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
increase then
 
01:29:20.090 --> 01:29:20.100 align:start position:0%
um there is that Gap what can be paid
 
01:29:22.310 --> 01:29:22.320 align:start position:0%
potentially can shrink the reverse is
 
01:29:25.010 --> 01:29:25.020 align:start position:0%
also true if the rate increases lower
 
01:29:26.750 --> 01:29:26.760 align:start position:0%
than their cost then the Gap may
 
01:29:29.330 --> 01:29:29.340 align:start position:0%
increase so we can fill in more of that
 
01:29:31.550 --> 01:29:31.560 align:start position:0%
but I think you know last legislative
 
01:29:34.189 --> 01:29:34.199 align:start position:0%
session there was a
 
01:29:36.229 --> 01:29:36.239 align:start position:0%
a rate increase passed for nursing
 
01:29:37.970 --> 01:29:37.980 align:start position:0%
facilities which
 
01:29:41.510 --> 01:29:41.520 align:start position:0%
um you know we assured through a couple
 
01:29:43.490 --> 01:29:43.500 align:start position:0%
different mechanisms that it would be at
 
01:29:45.470 --> 01:29:45.480 align:start position:0%
least five percent it's been more than
 
01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.810 align:start position:0%
least five percent it's been more than
that

01:29:46.810 --> 01:29:46.820 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:29:48.890 --> 01:29:48.900 align:start position:0%
in terms of the county facilities
 
01:29:52.010 --> 01:29:52.020 align:start position:0%
anyways and and and the base rate for
 
01:29:55.070 --> 01:29:55.080 align:start position:0%
all facilities but uh let me stop there
 
01:29:56.689 --> 01:29:56.699 align:start position:0%
because it can get a little bit more
 
01:29:58.430 --> 01:29:58.440 align:start position:0%
confusing as you go along but that's
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
actually hard to believe but yes uh any
 
01:30:04.070 --> 01:30:04.080 align:start position:0%
questions or at this point
 
01:30:05.510 --> 01:30:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
01:30:08.030 --> 01:30:08.040 align:start position:0%
yeah I wonder uh what are roughly the
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
base daily rates that you're dealing
 
01:30:12.350 --> 01:30:12.360 align:start position:0%
with uh and is there a difference by
 
01:30:16.129 --> 01:30:16.139 align:start position:0%
county or by uh County within you know
 
01:30:19.070 --> 01:30:19.080 align:start position:0%
by geographic area or uh private versus
 
01:30:20.750 --> 01:30:20.760 align:start position:0%
County facility
 
01:30:23.870 --> 01:30:23.880 align:start position:0%
so the the rates are set based on a
 
01:30:26.270 --> 01:30:26.280 align:start position:0%
Medicaid cost report from a Medicaid
 
01:30:28.669 --> 01:30:28.679 align:start position:0%
cost report so there are in the
 
01:30:30.890 --> 01:30:30.900 align:start position:0%
reimbursement methodology that is part
 
01:30:33.350 --> 01:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
of our state plan uh for example there
 
01:30:35.330 --> 01:30:35.340 align:start position:0%
are some limitations on Capital costs
 
01:30:38.390 --> 01:30:38.400 align:start position:0%
that uh it can't be more than
 
01:30:40.430 --> 01:30:40.440 align:start position:0%
um 85 percent of the median or something
 
01:30:43.129 --> 01:30:43.139 align:start position:0%
like that I don't have it memorized the
 
01:30:45.169 --> 01:30:45.179 align:start position:0%
league full of spot page but generally
 
01:30:47.750 --> 01:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
there's some controls so that that we're
 
01:30:49.250 --> 01:30:49.260 align:start position:0%
not reimbursing costs that are
 
01:30:52.490 --> 01:30:52.500 align:start position:0%
unreasonable if you will and so the the
 
01:30:54.290 --> 01:30:54.300 align:start position:0%
rates are set on a
 
01:30:54.300 --> 01:30:55.010 align:start position:0%
rates are set on a
um

01:30:55.010 --> 01:30:55.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:56.990 --> 01:30:57.000 align:start position:0%
on a
 
01:30:59.270 --> 01:30:59.280 align:start position:0%
you know completed cost report period
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
and and then our updated
 
01:31:02.400 --> 01:31:02.930 align:start position:0%
and and then our updated
um

01:31:02.930 --> 01:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:04.330 --> 01:31:04.340 align:start position:0%
twice a year
 
01:31:09.189 --> 01:31:09.199 align:start position:0%
to reflect uh changes in Acuity and and
 
01:31:11.570 --> 01:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
terms of how we set the base rate for
 
01:31:13.910 --> 01:31:13.920 align:start position:0%
the facilities so it's it's more
 
01:31:17.090 --> 01:31:17.100 align:start position:0%
variable based on the patient Acuity
 
01:31:19.850 --> 01:31:19.860 align:start position:0%
patient illness burden if you will the
 
01:31:21.410 --> 01:31:21.420 align:start position:0%
amount of nursing care that they need
 
01:31:24.649 --> 01:31:24.659 align:start position:0%
Rehabilitation and so forth and so a
 
01:31:26.750 --> 01:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
facility that accepts a higher case mix
 
01:31:28.850 --> 01:31:28.860 align:start position:0%
would typically you would expect to see
 
01:31:31.250 --> 01:31:31.260 align:start position:0%
have a higher rate because they have
 
01:31:34.189 --> 01:31:34.199 align:start position:0%
costs to cover that more complex patient
 
01:31:34.199 --> 01:31:36.649 align:start position:0%
costs to cover that more complex patient
mix

01:31:36.649 --> 01:31:36.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:39.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you um in terms of if I
 
01:31:40.550 --> 01:31:40.560 align:start position:0%
understand the Sam quick calculation
 
01:31:42.709 --> 01:31:42.719 align:start position:0%
basically in order to access the federal
 
01:31:45.830 --> 01:31:45.840 align:start position:0%
funds we have to put in 50 of the funds
 
01:31:47.930 --> 01:31:47.940 align:start position:0%
and we're collecting those 50 percent of
 
01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:50.340 align:start position:0%
the funds by charging a tax to the
 
01:31:52.430 --> 01:31:52.440 align:start position:0%
nursing homes so they're paying the
 
01:31:54.169 --> 01:31:54.179 align:start position:0%
money and then it's basically
 
01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
reapportioned as a payment back to the
 
01:31:58.610 --> 01:31:58.620 align:start position:0%
nursing home combined with the federal
 
01:32:01.250 --> 01:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
uh matching portion does that sound
 
01:32:03.350 --> 01:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
about right that's exactly right okay
 
01:32:05.510 --> 01:32:05.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:06.290 align:start position:0%
and um
um

01:32:06.290 --> 01:32:06.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:09.830 --> 01:32:09.840 align:start position:0%
ballpark you know what percentage above
 
01:32:11.629 --> 01:32:11.639 align:start position:0%
the base daily rate is at is that one
 
01:32:13.610 --> 01:32:13.620 align:start position:0%
percent or is that ten percent fifty
 
01:32:13.620 --> 01:32:15.470 align:start position:0%
percent or is that ten percent fifty
percent

01:32:15.470 --> 01:32:15.480 align:start position:0%
percent
 
01:32:18.169 --> 01:32:18.179 align:start position:0%
um well I think if the the budget is
 
01:32:22.250 --> 01:32:22.260 align:start position:0%
around 200 and the total budget is uh on
 
01:32:25.970 --> 01:32:25.980 align:start position:0%
the page for nursing facilities
 
01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:28.610 align:start position:0%
the page for nursing facilities
so

01:32:28.610 --> 01:32:28.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:31.610 --> 01:32:31.620 align:start position:0%
I think if you just take this m quip
 
01:32:33.530 --> 01:32:33.540 align:start position:0%
number and divide it by the total
 
01:32:35.570 --> 01:32:35.580 align:start position:0%
Nursing Facility payments that will give
 
01:32:37.010 --> 01:32:37.020 align:start position:0%
you that percentage I just don't have
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
that at the top of my head I can do that
 
01:32:41.390 --> 01:32:41.400 align:start position:0%
calculation and send it to you but based
 
01:32:41.400 --> 01:32:42.370 align:start position:0%
calculation and send it to you but based
on

01:32:42.370 --> 01:32:42.380 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:52.189 --> 01:32:52.199 align:start position:0%
326 024 about a quarter thousand uh on
 
01:32:54.649 --> 01:32:54.659 align:start position:0%
page 934 I think that would give you 20
 
01:32:56.990 --> 01:32:57.000 align:start position:0%
percentage but I'll double check that
 
01:32:57.000 --> 01:32:57.830 align:start position:0%
percentage but I'll double check that
number

01:32:57.830 --> 01:32:57.840 align:start position:0%
number
 
01:33:01.850 --> 01:33:01.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:03.110 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:33:03.110 --> 01:33:03.120 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:33:05.209 --> 01:33:05.219 align:start position:0%
ready for the next level
 
01:33:08.390 --> 01:33:08.400 align:start position:0%
I think we in large measure in terms of
 
01:33:11.629 --> 01:33:11.639 align:start position:0%
the the tax is what that's collector
 
01:33:13.370 --> 01:33:13.380 align:start position:0%
actually generates the payment there's
 
01:33:14.990 --> 01:33:15.000 align:start position:0%
no general fund
 
01:33:18.410 --> 01:33:18.420 align:start position:0%
exposure there Pro share is the same
 
01:33:21.050 --> 01:33:21.060 align:start position:0%
um and that the counties this one can be
 
01:33:23.629 --> 01:33:23.639 align:start position:0%
the sort of two flavors of it that exist
 
01:33:25.729 --> 01:33:25.739 align:start position:0%
that's representative erf is well aware
 
01:33:29.030 --> 01:33:29.040 align:start position:0%
of from Hillsborough County that um the
 
01:33:31.070 --> 01:33:31.080 align:start position:0%
majority of our nursing facilities
 
01:33:34.010 --> 01:33:34.020 align:start position:0%
and sort of stepping back for a moment
 
01:33:36.590 --> 01:33:36.600 align:start position:0%
back I think
 
01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:38.209 align:start position:0%
back I think
2000

01:33:38.209 --> 01:33:38.219 align:start position:0%
2000
 
01:33:38.219 --> 01:33:39.070 align:start position:0%
2000
2018

01:33:39.070 --> 01:33:39.080 align:start position:0%
2018
 
01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:41.880 align:start position:0%
we were sort of refined the method for
 
01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.010 align:start position:0%
we were sort of refined the method for
drawing

01:33:43.010 --> 01:33:43.020 align:start position:0%
drawing
 
01:33:45.950 --> 01:33:45.960 align:start position:0%
the match and we were able to increase
 
01:33:48.110 --> 01:33:48.120 align:start position:0%
the amount of pro share available pretty
 
01:33:49.910 --> 01:33:49.920 align:start position:0%
substantially for
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
um and then CMS made some adjustments to
 
01:33:53.390 --> 01:33:53.400 align:start position:0%
how we could
 
01:33:55.490 --> 01:33:55.500 align:start position:0%
do that which reduced it down some but
 
01:33:58.250 --> 01:33:58.260 align:start position:0%
compared to where we were in 2017 we're
 
01:33:59.810 --> 01:33:59.820 align:start position:0%
doing a better job in drawing Federal
 
01:34:02.709 --> 01:34:02.719 align:start position:0%
money for for nursing facilities
 
01:34:05.270 --> 01:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
there's two methodologies there's a
 
01:34:07.189 --> 01:34:07.199 align:start position:0%
certified public expenditure methodology
 
01:34:08.810 --> 01:34:08.820 align:start position:0%
which is the majority of our nursing
 
01:34:11.990 --> 01:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
homes are on which is that when we
 
01:34:15.350 --> 01:34:15.360 align:start position:0%
measure that gap of cost versus payments
 
01:34:18.189 --> 01:34:18.199 align:start position:0%
in the aggregate that
 
01:34:22.550 --> 01:34:22.560 align:start position:0%
CMS will pick up half of that and so
 
01:34:25.370 --> 01:34:25.380 align:start position:0%
what we do there is present a recent
 
01:34:27.950 --> 01:34:27.960 align:start position:0%
cost report usually we describe it as an
 
01:34:30.110 --> 01:34:30.120 align:start position:0%
interim cost report and so if the gap
 
01:34:32.030 --> 01:34:32.040 align:start position:0%
for a particular facility was three
 
01:34:34.490 --> 01:34:34.500 align:start position:0%
million dollars then
 
01:34:35.990 --> 01:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
um we would be able to draw a federal
 
01:34:39.350 --> 01:34:39.360 align:start position:0%
match of 1.5 million no dollars change
 
01:34:41.570 --> 01:34:41.580 align:start position:0%
hand other than presenting the our cost
 
01:34:45.470 --> 01:34:45.480 align:start position:0%
and then the feds matching that that Gap
 
01:34:49.070 --> 01:34:49.080 align:start position:0%
um by 50 percent during the the
 
01:34:52.129 --> 01:34:52.139 align:start position:0%
Public Health Emergency and our next
 
01:34:55.129 --> 01:34:55.139 align:start position:0%
payment will in 23 we'll have an extra
 
01:34:57.050 --> 01:34:57.060 align:start position:0%
five percent on it
 
01:34:57.060 --> 01:34:57.890 align:start position:0%
five percent on it
um

01:34:57.890 --> 01:34:57.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:35:01.550 --> 01:35:01.560 align:start position:0%
so that we'll get 55 as opposed to 50
 
01:35:03.590 --> 01:35:03.600 align:start position:0%
but that that will that won't happen
 
01:35:03.600 --> 01:35:05.030 align:start position:0%
but that that will that won't happen
again

01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
again
 
01:35:08.510 --> 01:35:08.520 align:start position:0%
um then and there's another
 
01:35:10.070 --> 01:35:10.080 align:start position:0%
um approach which Hillsborough County
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
and two other counties had used at one
 
01:35:14.870 --> 01:35:14.880 align:start position:0%
point uh because it was more
 
01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:16.669 align:start position:0%
point uh because it was more
advantageous

01:35:16.669 --> 01:35:16.679 align:start position:0%
advantageous
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
um is an intergovernmental transfer
 
01:35:21.470 --> 01:35:21.480 align:start position:0%
where similar to the tax the county has
 
01:35:24.410 --> 01:35:24.420 align:start position:0%
to come up with uh dollars and make a
 
01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:25.610 align:start position:0%
to come up with uh dollars and make a
payment

01:35:25.610 --> 01:35:25.620 align:start position:0%
payment
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
um for for that uh to the state then the
 
01:35:31.070 --> 01:35:31.080 align:start position:0%
state draws down a federal match to make
 
01:35:31.080 --> 01:35:32.689 align:start position:0%
state draws down a federal match to make
that

01:35:32.689 --> 01:35:32.699 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:35:35.689 --> 01:35:35.699 align:start position:0%
what's been interesting is during the
 
01:35:35.699 --> 01:35:36.830 align:start position:0%
what's been interesting is during the
the

01:35:36.830 --> 01:35:36.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:35:38.149 --> 01:35:38.159 align:start position:0%
you know we've talked a lot about
 
01:35:40.010 --> 01:35:40.020 align:start position:0%
Staffing shortages and the costs of
 
01:35:44.450 --> 01:35:44.460 align:start position:0%
covet and the like that it has become
 
01:35:47.149 --> 01:35:47.159 align:start position:0%
um more advantageous for all the nursing
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
facilities up to well say through 2022
 
01:35:53.149 --> 01:35:53.159 align:start position:0%
at this point to be on the certified
 
01:35:54.830 --> 01:35:54.840 align:start position:0%
public expenditure methodology because
 
01:35:57.770 --> 01:35:57.780 align:start position:0%
costs have gone up much faster than than
 
01:35:57.780 --> 01:35:59.330 align:start position:0%
costs have gone up much faster than than
rates

01:35:59.330 --> 01:35:59.340 align:start position:0%
rates
 
01:36:01.310 --> 01:36:01.320 align:start position:0%
um we're working through something with
 
01:36:02.990 --> 01:36:03.000 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County now to try to get
 
01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:05.520 align:start position:0%
them the most advantageous way of doing
 
01:36:07.669 --> 01:36:07.679 align:start position:0%
it and that's still an open item which
 
01:36:11.330 --> 01:36:11.340 align:start position:0%
uh I think the administration and the
 
01:36:13.870 --> 01:36:13.880 align:start position:0%
leadership they're aware of but
 
01:36:17.390 --> 01:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
so that depending on how that one goes
 
01:36:19.850 --> 01:36:19.860 align:start position:0%
it may go through an intergovernmental
 
01:36:22.070 --> 01:36:22.080 align:start position:0%
transfer or certified public expenditure
 
01:36:23.870 --> 01:36:23.880 align:start position:0%
we're going to try hard to get the most
 
01:36:26.090 --> 01:36:26.100 align:start position:0%
advantageous way
 
01:36:31.790 --> 01:36:31.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:35.090 --> 01:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
okay anything further Mr Lipton and that
 
01:36:38.149 --> 01:36:38.159 align:start position:0%
no I I happy to answer any questions I
 
01:36:39.770 --> 01:36:39.780 align:start position:0%
know it's a it's a little bit dense in
 
01:36:42.290 --> 01:36:42.300 align:start position:0%
terms of working through and you know we
 
01:36:44.030 --> 01:36:44.040 align:start position:0%
do have spreadsheets I know sometimes
 
01:36:47.030 --> 01:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's easier for people to to follow
 
01:36:49.610 --> 01:36:49.620 align:start position:0%
and be able to think about it um but
 
01:36:52.070 --> 01:36:52.080 align:start position:0%
it's not not necessarily recommended
 
01:36:54.530 --> 01:36:54.540 align:start position:0%
reading for everybody
 
01:37:00.590 --> 01:37:00.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.270 --> 01:37:02.280 align:start position:0%
so we'll proceed
 
01:37:04.490 --> 01:37:04.500 align:start position:0%
um through the categories
 
01:37:07.970 --> 01:37:07.980 align:start position:0%
my thought was to break it lunch uh 12
 
01:37:10.310 --> 01:37:10.320 align:start position:0%
noon I don't know if that's going to be
 
01:37:13.370 --> 01:37:13.380 align:start position:0%
um enough time for you to wrap up your
 
01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:14.880 align:start position:0%
program and I know there are others here
 
01:37:18.169 --> 01:37:18.179 align:start position:0%
that wish to speak I'm sure on this uh
 
01:37:20.930 --> 01:37:20.940 align:start position:0%
particular topic but that's my thought
 
01:37:25.550 --> 01:37:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:30.470 --> 01:37:30.480 align:start position:0%
um so if we move on to
 
01:37:33.169 --> 01:37:33.179 align:start position:0%
page 937 the CFI waiver program
 
01:37:33.179 --> 01:37:35.410 align:start position:0%
page 937 the CFI waiver program
eligibility

01:37:35.410 --> 01:37:35.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
01:37:39.950 --> 01:37:39.960 align:start position:0%
no no change in positions within this
 
01:37:43.070 --> 01:37:43.080 align:start position:0%
um within this account here uh there we
 
01:37:44.570 --> 01:37:44.580 align:start position:0%
we do have
 
01:37:49.189 --> 01:37:49.199 align:start position:0%
um A in the class 74 a larger a couple
 
01:37:52.070 --> 01:37:52.080 align:start position:0%
of contracts a key Pro contract and a
 
01:37:54.110 --> 01:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
contract with Community Partners this is
 
01:37:54.120 --> 01:37:55.370 align:start position:0%
contract with Community Partners this is
uh

01:37:55.370 --> 01:37:55.380 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:37:58.370 --> 01:37:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh this um I don't know if you want to
 
01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
speak to those
 
01:38:00.780 --> 01:38:01.910 align:start position:0%
speak to those
so

01:38:01.910 --> 01:38:01.920 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:38:05.390 --> 01:38:05.400 align:start position:0%
this is this department operates the
 
01:38:06.890 --> 01:38:06.900 align:start position:0%
nursing facility level of care
 
01:38:09.649 --> 01:38:09.659 align:start position:0%
determinations assignment of case
 
01:38:12.649 --> 01:38:12.659 align:start position:0%
management agencies for individuals that
 
01:38:15.709 --> 01:38:15.719 align:start position:0%
are coming on to the CFI program
 
01:38:19.910 --> 01:38:19.920 align:start position:0%
um also the um like Nathan said in set
 
01:38:23.930 --> 01:38:23.940 align:start position:0%
074 is our keeper contract which is a
 
01:38:27.229 --> 01:38:27.239 align:start position:0%
screening for people who are nursing
 
01:38:29.689 --> 01:38:29.699 align:start position:0%
home looking to be admitted to a nursing
 
01:38:31.870 --> 01:38:31.880 align:start position:0%
home so screening for any
 
01:38:34.310 --> 01:38:34.320 align:start position:0%
mental illness or developmental
 
01:38:35.930 --> 01:38:35.940 align:start position:0%
disability to ensure that they're
 
01:38:37.729 --> 01:38:37.739 align:start position:0%
appropriate to be at a nursing facility
 
01:38:40.610 --> 01:38:40.620 align:start position:0%
and not in another level of care
 
01:38:42.110 --> 01:38:42.120 align:start position:0%
um and then the contract with Community
 
01:38:45.050 --> 01:38:45.060 align:start position:0%
Partners is to fund to full-time
 
01:38:47.149 --> 01:38:47.159 align:start position:0%
eligibility coordinators
 
01:38:48.890 --> 01:38:48.900 align:start position:0%
um that are housed via service link
 
01:38:51.410 --> 01:38:51.420 align:start position:0%
representative erf for a question
 
01:38:54.410 --> 01:38:54.420 align:start position:0%
so the CFI that's here is that the total
 
01:38:56.030 --> 01:38:56.040 align:start position:0%
program or is that just a CFI as it
 
01:38:59.930 --> 01:38:59.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
um this would be this the PSI program
 
01:39:05.330 --> 01:39:05.340 align:start position:0%
kind of like administrative costs as far
 
01:39:07.250 --> 01:39:07.260 align:start position:0%
as it's determining people's eligibility
 
01:39:10.070 --> 01:39:10.080 align:start position:0%
for CFI so not the actual provision of
 
01:39:11.450 --> 01:39:11.460 align:start position:0%
service but
 
01:39:13.729 --> 01:39:13.739 align:start position:0%
um getting people enrolled in Medicaid
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
making sure they meet the CFI
 
01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:17.570 align:start position:0%
making sure they meet the CFI
eligibility

01:39:17.570 --> 01:39:17.580 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
01:39:19.610 --> 01:39:19.620 align:start position:0%
um and doing
 
01:39:22.370 --> 01:39:22.380 align:start position:0%
um that Medicaid the medical eligibility
 
01:39:24.530 --> 01:39:24.540 align:start position:0%
determination for the administrative
 
01:39:28.010 --> 01:39:28.020 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:31.370 --> 01:39:31.380 align:start position:0%
um on page 9 30 uh 938 still monetary
 
01:39:31.380 --> 01:39:32.629 align:start position:0%
um on page 9 30 uh 938 still monetary
penalties

01:39:32.629 --> 01:39:32.639 align:start position:0%
penalties
 
01:39:35.390 --> 01:39:35.400 align:start position:0%
um our our legal team uh they actually
 
01:39:38.570 --> 01:39:38.580 align:start position:0%
collect uh various penalties you'll see
 
01:39:41.629 --> 01:39:41.639 align:start position:0%
a pretty dramatic uh decrease from our
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
contract line uh in safe field school
 
01:39:45.830 --> 01:39:45.840 align:start position:0%
year 23.
 
01:39:48.110 --> 01:39:48.120 align:start position:0%
um we we've adjusted that in 24 and 25
 
01:39:50.629 --> 01:39:50.639 align:start position:0%
to make it a little bit more accurate
 
01:39:52.129 --> 01:39:52.139 align:start position:0%
and appropriate
 
01:39:53.870 --> 01:39:53.880 align:start position:0%
um and anytime we do receive penalties
 
01:39:55.910 --> 01:39:55.920 align:start position:0%
we actually have to submit a plan to the
 
01:39:59.390 --> 01:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
feds to receive approval and and we use
 
01:40:01.070 --> 01:40:01.080 align:start position:0%
these dollars to make Nursing Facility
 
01:40:05.450 --> 01:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
improvements and other related projects
 
01:40:05.460 --> 01:40:06.110 align:start position:0%
improvements and other related projects
um

01:40:06.110 --> 01:40:06.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:08.290 --> 01:40:08.300 align:start position:0%
on page
 
01:40:10.189 --> 01:40:10.199 align:start position:0%
let's see here
 
01:40:13.729 --> 01:40:13.739 align:start position:0%
so if okay so from there we will
 
01:40:17.590 --> 01:40:17.600 align:start position:0%
actually be turning to page
 
01:40:20.870 --> 01:40:20.880 align:start position:0%
1042 and in your
 
01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:21.890 align:start position:0%
1042 and in your
um

01:40:21.890 --> 01:40:21.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:25.550 --> 01:40:25.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:28.189 --> 01:40:28.199 align:start position:0%
all right and then in your
 
01:40:28.199 --> 01:40:28.990 align:start position:0%
all right and then in your
um

01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:29.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:32.030 --> 01:40:32.040 align:start position:0%
your presentation the the coloring book
 
01:40:34.129 --> 01:40:34.139 align:start position:0%
I I really like that phrase I think the
 
01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:36.360 align:start position:0%
colors go well with that determinology
 
01:40:38.270 --> 01:40:38.280 align:start position:0%
um it's we're actually on on page 12
 
01:40:40.810 --> 01:40:40.820 align:start position:0%
right now
 
01:40:49.850 --> 01:40:49.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:52.010 --> 01:40:52.020 align:start position:0%
yep so so we'll come back to page 11 in
 
01:40:53.930 --> 01:40:53.940 align:start position:0%
in the presentation in the PowerPoint
 
01:40:58.129 --> 01:40:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:03.770 --> 01:41:03.780 align:start position:0%
so if if we turn to to page uh 1042
 
01:41:06.350 --> 01:41:06.360 align:start position:0%
um this is our this is our our DNA
 
01:41:07.970 --> 01:41:07.980 align:start position:0%
account and we had talked about this
 
01:41:10.430 --> 01:41:10.440 align:start position:0%
earlier with the dads rate
 
01:41:13.490 --> 01:41:13.500 align:start position:0%
um in there uh which which would um
 
01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
offset the the cost in 502 to allow us
 
01:41:18.590 --> 01:41:18.600 align:start position:0%
to provide that three percent increase
 
01:41:20.870 --> 01:41:20.880 align:start position:0%
to the existing rates
 
01:41:23.629 --> 01:41:23.639 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if we want to discuss uh
 
01:41:26.270 --> 01:41:26.280 align:start position:0%
this in more detail or are we are we
 
01:41:27.890 --> 01:41:27.900 align:start position:0%
good there
 
01:41:29.570 --> 01:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
it looks like we're all set okay
 
01:41:33.530 --> 01:41:33.540 align:start position:0%
excellent uh on page uh 1043 this is uh
 
01:41:33.540 --> 01:41:36.229 align:start position:0%
excellent uh on page uh 1043 this is uh
59.47

01:41:36.229 --> 01:41:36.239 align:start position:0%
59.47
 
01:41:38.930 --> 01:41:38.940 align:start position:0%
um we did have uh we did have a
 
01:41:41.689 --> 01:41:41.699 align:start position:0%
conversion here uh you you will see an
 
01:41:43.850 --> 01:41:43.860 align:start position:0%
increase in the number of personnel uh
 
01:41:47.689 --> 01:41:47.699 align:start position:0%
we did convert a full-time uh temporary
 
01:41:49.790 --> 01:41:49.800 align:start position:0%
position to a full-time authorized
 
01:41:52.129 --> 01:41:52.139 align:start position:0%
position uh through the process that I
 
01:41:54.830 --> 01:41:54.840 align:start position:0%
described earlier the indirect cost line
 
01:41:58.189 --> 01:41:58.199 align:start position:0%
that was zeroed out there uh 040 that
 
01:42:00.590 --> 01:42:00.600 align:start position:0%
was centralized within 9 500 within the
 
01:42:03.410 --> 01:42:03.420 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner we also added
 
01:42:05.930 --> 01:42:05.940 align:start position:0%
one temporary position here in class 50
 
01:42:08.030 --> 01:42:08.040 align:start position:0%
as well
 
01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:09.960 align:start position:0%
um there are a couple of larger
 
01:42:11.570 --> 01:42:11.580 align:start position:0%
contracts that are paid out of this
 
01:42:14.510 --> 01:42:14.520 align:start position:0%
account and I'll also speak to those
 
01:42:16.729 --> 01:42:16.739 align:start position:0%
yeah so we have a contract with the
 
01:42:19.370 --> 01:42:19.380 align:start position:0%
University of New Hampshire Institute on
 
01:42:22.490 --> 01:42:22.500 align:start position:0%
disabilities so they do a lot of work
 
01:42:25.310 --> 01:42:25.320 align:start position:0%
with us in coming up with you know um
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
planning for our disability Community we
 
01:42:31.669 --> 01:42:31.679 align:start position:0%
also have some money in there for
 
01:42:34.070 --> 01:42:34.080 align:start position:0%
Guardianship Services so either through
 
01:42:35.689 --> 01:42:35.699 align:start position:0%
the Office of Public guardian or
 
01:42:38.510 --> 01:42:38.520 align:start position:0%
Tri-County Guardianship Services for
 
01:42:48.109 --> 01:42:48.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:53.090 --> 01:42:53.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:54.830 --> 01:42:54.840 align:start position:0%
looks like representative Wallner for
 
01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:56.330 align:start position:0%
looks like representative Wallner for
question

01:42:56.330 --> 01:42:56.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:42:56.340 --> 01:42:57.470 align:start position:0%
question
obviously

01:42:57.470 --> 01:42:57.480 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:42:57.480 --> 01:42:58.070 align:start position:0%
obviously
um

01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:43:00.830 --> 01:43:00.840 align:start position:0%
under 102 the contracts have gone up
 
01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:07.070 align:start position:0%
under 102 the contracts have gone up
considerably

01:43:07.070 --> 01:43:07.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:09.169 --> 01:43:09.179 align:start position:0%
this was the um
 
01:43:11.030 --> 01:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
the guardian service one million dollar
 
01:43:15.470 --> 01:43:15.480 align:start position:0%
oh yes so so we previously had these
 
01:43:21.530 --> 01:43:21.540 align:start position:0%
dollars in account of 41 14.
 
01:43:22.729 --> 01:43:22.739 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you the name of that
 
01:43:27.530 --> 01:43:27.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:31.910 --> 01:43:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:34.250 --> 01:43:34.260 align:start position:0%
yeah so the so we previously had these
 
01:43:35.510 --> 01:43:35.520 align:start position:0%
dollars within the Bureau of Mental
 
01:43:36.890 --> 01:43:36.900 align:start position:0%
Health Services
 
01:43:39.830 --> 01:43:39.840 align:start position:0%
um within Guardianship Services in in
 
01:43:41.750 --> 01:43:41.760 align:start position:0%
their class 102 and we and we moved
 
01:43:43.609 --> 01:43:43.619 align:start position:0%
about a million dollars
 
01:43:46.070 --> 01:43:46.080 align:start position:0%
um over into this account uh and Melissa
 
01:43:47.570 --> 01:43:47.580 align:start position:0%
can speak to the rationale yeah it was
 
01:43:49.310 --> 01:43:49.320 align:start position:0%
really to pay our fair share for the
 
01:43:51.410 --> 01:43:51.420 align:start position:0%
guardianship slots that we that we um
 
01:43:54.649 --> 01:43:54.659 align:start position:0%
have so we were able to move that money
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
over for us to have not only an
 
01:44:00.470 --> 01:44:00.480 align:start position:0%
increased uh rate for
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
um the Office of Public Guardian but
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
also increased number of slots for
 
01:44:05.930 --> 01:44:05.940 align:start position:0%
guardianships and what was the previous
 
01:44:08.649 --> 01:44:08.659 align:start position:0%
account you mentioned it's
 
01:44:12.109 --> 01:44:12.119 align:start position:0%
4114 so so you'll see approximately I'm
 
01:44:13.669 --> 01:44:13.679 align:start position:0%
just doing some back of the envelope
 
01:44:16.550 --> 01:44:16.560 align:start position:0%
math of approximately 850 000 reduction
 
01:44:21.169 --> 01:44:21.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:21.179 --> 01:44:24.950 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

01:44:24.950 --> 01:44:24.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:27.890 --> 01:44:27.900 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:31.970 --> 01:44:31.980 align:start position:0%
and and those were 100 General funds
 
01:44:37.609 --> 01:44:37.619 align:start position:0%
on page 1044 uh 7016 account acquired
 
01:44:40.129 --> 01:44:40.139 align:start position:0%
brain disorder services
 
01:44:41.750 --> 01:44:41.760 align:start position:0%
um we
 
01:44:44.570 --> 01:44:44.580 align:start position:0%
uh do you want to speak to the sure so
 
01:44:47.510 --> 01:44:47.520 align:start position:0%
this is another 1915 C waiver program
 
01:44:49.689 --> 01:44:49.699 align:start position:0%
that the bureau
 
01:44:52.129 --> 01:44:52.139 align:start position:0%
administers with our providers in the
 
01:44:54.169 --> 01:44:54.179 align:start position:0%
community for people with an acquired
 
01:44:57.229 --> 01:44:57.239 align:start position:0%
brain disorder so individuals who
 
01:45:00.770 --> 01:45:00.780 align:start position:0%
sustained a a brain injury after the age
 
01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
of 22 and are financially and medically
 
01:45:07.370 --> 01:45:07.380 align:start position:0%
eligible at a level of care that would
 
01:45:09.410 --> 01:45:09.420 align:start position:0%
meet nursing home level of care but want
 
01:45:12.770 --> 01:45:12.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:14.570 --> 01:45:14.580 align:start position:0%
so some of the services would be
 
01:45:17.689 --> 01:45:17.699 align:start position:0%
Residential Services day Services if
 
01:45:19.669 --> 01:45:19.679 align:start position:0%
they need environmental modifications or
 
01:45:21.490 --> 01:45:21.500 align:start position:0%
vehicle modifications
 
01:45:24.490 --> 01:45:24.500 align:start position:0%
supported employment technology Services
 
01:45:27.109 --> 01:45:27.119 align:start position:0%
representative irf for question
 
01:45:28.550 --> 01:45:28.560 align:start position:0%
so there's some pretty large increases
 
01:45:31.270 --> 01:45:31.280 align:start position:0%
here I'm not Muslim
 
01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:33.169 align:start position:0%
here I'm not Muslim
misunderstanding

01:45:33.169 --> 01:45:33.179 align:start position:0%
misunderstanding
 
01:45:38.030 --> 01:45:38.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
um the these are these are based on on
 
01:45:42.530 --> 01:45:42.540 align:start position:0%
the projections for for the services
 
01:45:44.270 --> 01:45:44.280 align:start position:0%
that are needed that that we have today
 
01:45:46.430 --> 01:45:46.440 align:start position:0%
and and that's where those figures came
 
01:45:46.440 --> 01:45:47.930 align:start position:0%
and and that's where those figures came
from

01:45:47.930 --> 01:45:47.940 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:45:52.669 --> 01:45:52.679 align:start position:0%
so more people in the programs so what
 
01:45:55.010 --> 01:45:55.020 align:start position:0%
that yes that is my understanding is
 
01:45:55.020 --> 01:45:58.729 align:start position:0%
that yes that is my understanding is
that

01:45:58.729 --> 01:45:58.739 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:00.649 --> 01:46:00.659 align:start position:0%
I would I would say that um when you
 
01:46:02.149 --> 01:46:02.159 align:start position:0%
look in I think in the budget briefing
 
01:46:03.709 --> 01:46:03.719 align:start position:0%
Book You'll see
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
um I don't know if there's a much of an
 
01:46:08.390 --> 01:46:08.400 align:start position:0%
increase but we're we're we have an
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
eligibility person within BDS that is
 
01:46:13.070 --> 01:46:13.080 align:start position:0%
seeing an increase
 
01:46:15.890 --> 01:46:15.900 align:start position:0%
um even in this uh years calendar year
 
01:46:18.890 --> 01:46:18.900 align:start position:0%
for folks for services on on this waiver
 
01:46:21.590 --> 01:46:21.600 align:start position:0%
so we're seeing more people that have an
 
01:46:24.350 --> 01:46:24.360 align:start position:0%
acquired brain injury that are aren't
 
01:46:26.330 --> 01:46:26.340 align:start position:0%
necessarily better served on the
 
01:46:29.450 --> 01:46:29.460 align:start position:0%
developmental Services waiver that their
 
01:46:31.010 --> 01:46:31.020 align:start position:0%
needs are different the Staffing's
 
01:46:33.830 --> 01:46:33.840 align:start position:0%
different the the recreational services
 
01:46:35.930 --> 01:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
are different for people with the with
 
01:46:38.149 --> 01:46:38.159 align:start position:0%
the brain injury
 
01:46:41.390 --> 01:46:41.400 align:start position:0%
representative walner for a question so
 
01:46:43.310 --> 01:46:43.320 align:start position:0%
approximately how many people are on the
 
01:46:44.990 --> 01:46:45.000 align:start position:0%
on this um
 
01:46:46.970 --> 01:46:46.980 align:start position:0%
are on the brain
 
01:46:50.510 --> 01:46:50.520 align:start position:0%
this area the brain disorder
 
01:46:52.250 --> 01:46:52.260 align:start position:0%
so for
 
01:46:52.260 --> 01:46:53.209 align:start position:0%
so for
um

01:46:53.209 --> 01:46:53.219 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:58.609 --> 01:46:58.619 align:start position:0%
State fiscal year 23 it was 292 people
 
01:47:02.530 --> 01:47:02.540 align:start position:0%
um we're looking at 297 for 24
 
01:47:08.149 --> 01:47:08.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:10.729 --> 01:47:10.739 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
01:47:12.410 --> 01:47:12.420 align:start position:0%
yeah I was just wondering if you color
 
01:47:13.729 --> 01:47:13.739 align:start position:0%
this in a little bit I mean we're
 
01:47:15.350 --> 01:47:15.360 align:start position:0%
looking at a hundred and fifty thousand
 
01:47:18.169 --> 01:47:18.179 align:start position:0%
dollars per per case and these are
 
01:47:19.850 --> 01:47:19.860 align:start position:0%
people if I read the note that are
 
01:47:22.490 --> 01:47:22.500 align:start position:0%
already Medicaid eligible so they have
 
01:47:26.209 --> 01:47:26.219 align:start position:0%
access to some medical services that
 
01:47:28.310 --> 01:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
would not come out of this this budget
 
01:47:30.410 --> 01:47:30.420 align:start position:0%
so and
 
01:47:32.629 --> 01:47:32.639 align:start position:0%
um you know I understand you know some
 
01:47:35.030 --> 01:47:35.040 align:start position:0%
degree of Home refurbishing or things
 
01:47:37.070 --> 01:47:37.080 align:start position:0%
like that but that it just sounds like a
 
01:47:38.750 --> 01:47:38.760 align:start position:0%
much much bigger number
 
01:47:41.330 --> 01:47:41.340 align:start position:0%
yeah a lot of the services that are
 
01:47:43.910 --> 01:47:43.920 align:start position:0%
provided under this Weaver are also like
 
01:47:46.010 --> 01:47:46.020 align:start position:0%
a an assisted living residential service
 
01:47:46.020 --> 01:47:47.870 align:start position:0%
a an assisted living residential service
so

01:47:47.870 --> 01:47:47.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:50.520 align:start position:0%
um if they can't live independently
 
01:47:52.129 --> 01:47:52.139 align:start position:0%
um in in an apartment or in the
 
01:47:53.810 --> 01:47:53.820 align:start position:0%
community there are
 
01:47:57.649 --> 01:47:57.659 align:start position:0%
um uh beds that are
 
01:47:59.390 --> 01:47:59.400 align:start position:0%
um paid for under the waiver for
 
01:48:01.370 --> 01:48:01.380 align:start position:0%
residential services
 
01:48:04.550 --> 01:48:04.560 align:start position:0%
which drives the cost higher
 
01:48:07.189 --> 01:48:07.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:48:12.169 --> 01:48:12.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:14.990 --> 01:48:15.000 align:start position:0%
so the increase in numbers of people the
 
01:48:17.450 --> 01:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
percentage changes there are not even
 
01:48:19.189 --> 01:48:19.199 align:start position:0%
close to the percentage changes in the
 
01:48:24.590 --> 01:48:24.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:26.510 --> 01:48:26.520 align:start position:0%
would it be acceptable if if we get an
 
01:48:28.609 --> 01:48:28.619 align:start position:0%
analysis together and and send that to
 
01:48:29.990 --> 01:48:30.000 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
01:48:31.729 --> 01:48:31.739 align:start position:0%
that would be awesome all right thank
 
01:48:31.739 --> 01:48:34.430 align:start position:0%
that would be awesome all right thank
you

01:48:34.430 --> 01:48:34.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.950 --> 01:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
representative walner are you or
 
01:48:38.629 --> 01:48:38.639 align:start position:0%
question okay
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative for a question just a
 
01:48:42.890 --> 01:48:42.900 align:start position:0%
quick question like a big picture look
 
01:48:45.229 --> 01:48:45.239 align:start position:0%
at this category
 
01:48:48.050 --> 01:48:48.060 align:start position:0%
um would I be correct in that providing
 
01:48:50.209 --> 01:48:50.219 align:start position:0%
services to people
 
01:48:52.970 --> 01:48:52.980 align:start position:0%
in their home would be more affordable
 
01:48:56.149 --> 01:48:56.159 align:start position:0%
than the services in a institution a
 
01:48:59.090 --> 01:48:59.100 align:start position:0%
nursing home yes absolutely so the the
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
cost of serving most people in the
 
01:49:03.169 --> 01:49:03.179 align:start position:0%
community is less than institutional
 
01:49:04.910 --> 01:49:04.920 align:start position:0%
care so
 
01:49:08.149 --> 01:49:08.159 align:start position:0%
those totals you gave roughly 300 people
 
01:49:11.030 --> 01:49:11.040 align:start position:0%
is does that include all
 
01:49:11.040 --> 01:49:11.870 align:start position:0%
is does that include all
um

01:49:11.870 --> 01:49:11.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:14.209 --> 01:49:14.219 align:start position:0%
persons who
 
01:49:16.010 --> 01:49:16.020 align:start position:0%
fall in this category or could there be
 
01:49:18.050 --> 01:49:18.060 align:start position:0%
other patients that are in nursing
 
01:49:20.270 --> 01:49:20.280 align:start position:0%
facilities no it would just be these
 
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:29.030 --> 01:49:29.040 align:start position:0%
okay we're ready for the next category
 
01:49:29.040 --> 01:49:30.530 align:start position:0%
okay we're ready for the next category
okay

01:49:30.530 --> 01:49:30.540 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:49:34.510 --> 01:49:34.520 align:start position:0%
um and then if you turn to page uh 10 45
 
01:49:38.930 --> 01:49:38.940 align:start position:0%
uh this is 7110 account this is the
 
01:49:41.030 --> 01:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
children in home support waiver
 
01:49:44.149 --> 01:49:44.159 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is another 1915 C waiver
 
01:49:46.189 --> 01:49:46.199 align:start position:0%
that supports
 
01:49:47.330 --> 01:49:47.340 align:start position:0%
um children
 
01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:47.990 align:start position:0%
um children
um

01:49:47.990 --> 01:49:48.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
age 21 or under that lives at home with
 
01:49:53.090 --> 01:49:53.100 align:start position:0%
their family and again there's some
 
01:49:55.250 --> 01:49:55.260 align:start position:0%
level of care determinations that need
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
to be made but really it's it's it's a
 
01:50:00.470 --> 01:50:00.480 align:start position:0%
waiver to help support kids and their
 
01:50:02.750 --> 01:50:02.760 align:start position:0%
families to stay at home again rather
 
01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:09.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:12.709 --> 01:50:12.719 align:start position:0%
and um representative Wallner for a
 
01:50:14.270 --> 01:50:14.280 align:start position:0%
question I just I wondered how many
 
01:50:33.709 --> 01:50:33.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:33.719 --> 01:50:38.209 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:50:38.209 --> 01:50:38.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:42.950 --> 01:50:42.960 align:start position:0%
so for State fiscal year 22 it was 456
 
01:50:42.960 --> 01:50:44.450 align:start position:0%
so for State fiscal year 22 it was 456
um individuals

01:50:44.450 --> 01:50:44.460 align:start position:0%
um individuals
 
01:50:46.729 --> 01:50:46.739 align:start position:0%
um for were projecting for this fiscal
 
01:50:46.739 --> 01:50:47.930 align:start position:0%
um for were projecting for this fiscal
year

01:50:47.930 --> 01:50:47.940 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:50:51.109 --> 01:50:51.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:53.090 --> 01:50:53.100 align:start position:0%
um people being served
 
01:50:55.310 --> 01:50:55.320 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Stringham for a
 
01:50:55.320 --> 01:50:56.450 align:start position:0%
welcome representative Stringham for a
question

01:50:56.450 --> 01:50:56.460 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:50:58.310 --> 01:50:58.320 align:start position:0%
um yeah just just my understanding that
 
01:51:00.410 --> 01:51:00.420 align:start position:0%
the disability uh developmentally
 
01:51:02.090 --> 01:51:02.100 align:start position:0%
disabled support for children was
 
01:51:03.709 --> 01:51:03.719 align:start position:0%
largely provided through the school
 
01:51:03.719 --> 01:51:04.729 align:start position:0%
largely provided through the school
system

01:51:04.729 --> 01:51:04.739 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:51:08.390 --> 01:51:08.400 align:start position:0%
so how does this coordinate with that or
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
um do I misunderstand no yeah it is a
 
01:51:13.490 --> 01:51:13.500 align:start position:0%
collaborative kind uh it's a
 
01:51:14.990 --> 01:51:15.000 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort between the school
 
01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:16.370 align:start position:0%
collaborative effort between the school
system

01:51:16.370 --> 01:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:51:19.970 --> 01:51:19.980 align:start position:0%
um sometimes dcyf is involved as well
 
01:51:23.330 --> 01:51:23.340 align:start position:0%
um and us at BDS as far as you know
 
01:51:25.430 --> 01:51:25.440 align:start position:0%
who's eligible for what type of service
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
so if a school determines that their
 
01:51:31.129 --> 01:51:31.139 align:start position:0%
education needs can be met despite their
 
01:51:33.290 --> 01:51:33.300 align:start position:0%
developmental disabilities then we're
 
01:51:35.149 --> 01:51:35.159 align:start position:0%
engaged in providing some Services
 
01:51:38.149 --> 01:51:38.159 align:start position:0%
versus the schools being
 
01:51:41.750 --> 01:51:41.760 align:start position:0%
um the ones providing that service
 
01:51:43.790 --> 01:51:43.800 align:start position:0%
they've said do your payments then go to
 
01:51:46.850 --> 01:51:46.860 align:start position:0%
the school system or direct a provider
 
01:51:49.910 --> 01:51:49.920 align:start position:0%
or right yeah nope it goes directly to
 
01:51:52.430 --> 01:51:52.440 align:start position:0%
the area agency system who then um
 
01:51:54.590 --> 01:51:54.600 align:start position:0%
distribute the money to the the families
 
01:52:00.290 --> 01:52:00.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:00.300 --> 01:52:01.970 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:52:01.970 --> 01:52:01.980 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:52:03.530 --> 01:52:03.540 align:start position:0%
I think we're
 
01:52:05.990 --> 01:52:06.000 align:start position:0%
ready to proceed okay
 
01:52:09.770 --> 01:52:09.780 align:start position:0%
um if we turn to page uh 10 10 46
 
01:52:09.780 --> 01:52:12.229 align:start position:0%
um if we turn to page uh 10 10 46
um

01:52:12.229 --> 01:52:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:17.350 --> 01:52:17.360 align:start position:0%
yes uh account uh 7013
 
01:52:17.360 --> 01:52:18.050 align:start position:0%
yes uh account uh 7013

01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:18.669 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:52:18.669 --> 01:52:18.679 align:start position:0%
um

these These are the contracts that we
 
01:52:22.850 --> 01:52:22.860 align:start position:0%
have with the area agencies that are
 
01:52:25.729 --> 01:52:25.739 align:start position:0%
reflected here it's 100 General funds
 
01:52:27.830 --> 01:52:27.840 align:start position:0%
for for I don't know if there's any
 
01:52:31.189 --> 01:52:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:33.590 --> 01:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
we look good okay
 
01:52:37.430 --> 01:52:37.440 align:start position:0%
um moving on excuse me uh to 7167
 
01:52:39.709 --> 01:52:39.719 align:start position:0%
Medicaid compliance
 
01:52:41.390 --> 01:52:41.400 align:start position:0%
um two positions you will notice an
 
01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
increasing in class 10 uh two positions
 
01:52:46.370 --> 01:52:46.380 align:start position:0%
were previously unfunded in the prior
 
01:52:47.750 --> 01:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
biennium that's why you're not seeing an
 
01:52:50.750 --> 01:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
FTE increase on page 1047 but only an
 
01:52:53.090 --> 01:52:53.100 align:start position:0%
increase in the class 10 and I don't
 
01:52:54.470 --> 01:52:54.480 align:start position:0%
know if there's any other questions on
 
01:52:57.169 --> 01:52:57.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:01.430 --> 01:53:01.440 align:start position:0%

and then that brings us to page
 
01:53:16.790 --> 01:53:16.800 align:start position:0%
it it brings us to page 11 we're
 
01:53:18.290 --> 01:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
actually going backwards in the in the

um we also have a contract line here
 
01:55:56.810 --> 01:55:56.820 align:start position:0%
that that is used to pay for the area
 
01:55:59.090 --> 01:55:59.100 align:start position:0%
agency contracts
 
01:56:00.649 --> 01:56:00.659 align:start position:0%
um and again you'll you'll start to see
 
01:56:02.629 --> 01:56:02.639 align:start position:0%
a theme within within many of the
 
01:56:04.129 --> 01:56:04.139 align:start position:0%
accounts within the department where we
 
01:56:05.750 --> 01:56:05.760 align:start position:0%
have single contracts that are paid out
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
of uh multiple uh streams of funding
 
01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:11.810 align:start position:0%
of uh multiple uh streams of funding
okay

01:56:11.810 --> 01:56:11.820 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:56:14.330 --> 01:56:14.340 align:start position:0%
um all right if you
 
01:56:16.310 --> 01:56:16.320 align:start position:0%
let's see here
 
01:56:19.609 --> 01:56:19.619 align:start position:0%
turning to pay uh turn into page 1052
 
01:56:22.669 --> 01:56:22.679 align:start position:0%
there there is a class note there
 
01:56:25.970 --> 01:56:25.980 align:start position:0%
um the funds in in 502 do not lapse for
 
01:56:30.109 --> 01:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:30.119 --> 01:56:31.729 align:start position:0%
 
and

01:56:31.729 --> 01:56:31.739 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:56:39.950 --> 01:56:39.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:42.410 --> 01:56:42.420 align:start position:0%
thank you both very much very detailed I
 
01:56:43.850 --> 01:56:43.860 align:start position:0%
think that was a very thorough go
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
through and we're all fully cognizant of
 
01:56:49.550 --> 01:56:49.560 align:start position:0%
how much time and effort you put into
 
01:56:52.430 --> 01:56:52.440 align:start position:0%
these presentations I know we see an
 
01:56:54.169 --> 01:56:54.179 align:start position:0%
incredible amount of effort and time
 
01:56:56.629 --> 01:56:56.639 align:start position:0%
just in the last two hours but we don't
 
01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
see behind the scenes but we're still
 
01:57:01.370 --> 01:57:01.380 align:start position:0%
very much aware of how much goes into
 
01:57:03.830 --> 01:57:03.840 align:start position:0%
each and every square inch of these
 
01:57:06.649 --> 01:57:06.659 align:start position:0%
presentations so thank you both
 
01:57:08.750 --> 01:57:08.760 align:start position:0%
I do just want to add as a follow-up
 
01:57:12.770 --> 01:57:12.780 align:start position:0%
from the from my support back there um
 
01:57:16.370 --> 01:57:16.380 align:start position:0%
as far as the um the meals we serve last
 
01:57:18.350 --> 01:57:18.360 align:start position:0%
fiscal year we served one million six
 
01:57:20.750 --> 01:57:20.760 align:start position:0%
hundred and thirteen thousand four uh
 
01:57:23.229 --> 01:57:23.239 align:start position:0%
one million 613
 
01:57:26.570 --> 01:57:26.580 align:start position:0%
740 meals with just our uh money through
 
01:57:28.609 --> 01:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
the contracts so that doesn't include
 
01:57:30.649 --> 01:57:30.659 align:start position:0%
the agency fundraising meals things like
 
01:57:34.729 --> 01:57:34.739 align:start position:0%
that so just wanted to add that
 
01:57:36.350 --> 01:57:36.360 align:start position:0%
real good and I know there are a few
 
01:57:38.510 --> 01:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
other uh follow-up items too if you need
 
01:57:39.649 --> 01:57:39.659 align:start position:0%
any um
 
01:57:41.629 --> 01:57:41.639 align:start position:0%
I'm sure you have notes on those but we
 
01:57:43.070 --> 01:57:43.080 align:start position:0%
do as well so that'll be good to get
 
01:57:45.830 --> 01:57:45.840 align:start position:0%
those from you anything uh to close out
 
01:57:49.070 --> 01:57:49.080 align:start position:0%
this particular presentation
 
01:57:51.229 --> 01:57:51.239 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham some about the
 
01:57:53.089 --> 01:57:53.099 align:start position:0%
discussions made me real hungry I'm not
 
01:57:55.310 --> 01:57:55.320 align:start position:0%
sure why
 
01:57:57.530 --> 01:57:57.540 align:start position:0%
maybe we can get you a meal a home
 
01:58:01.370 --> 01:58:01.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:04.669 --> 01:58:04.679 align:start position:0%
okay thank you both very much now a
 
01:58:07.550 --> 01:58:07.560 align:start position:0%
thing as though it's almost a 5 of 12.
 
01:58:09.410 --> 01:58:09.420 align:start position:0%
I'm curious as to who in the audience
 
01:58:12.530 --> 01:58:12.540 align:start position:0%
would like to come up and talk related
 
01:58:15.950 --> 01:58:15.960 align:start position:0%
to this particular work session on this
 
01:58:19.370 --> 01:58:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:22.060 --> 01:58:22.070 align:start position:0%
no one Gina I thought so
 
01:58:22.070 --> 01:58:26.270 align:start position:0%
no one Gina I thought so
[Laughter]

01:58:26.270 --> 01:58:26.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:26.280 --> 01:58:29.870 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:58:29.870 --> 01:58:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:32.270 --> 01:58:32.280 align:start position:0%
yes I if everyone's agreeable to that I
 
01:58:33.830 --> 01:58:33.840 align:start position:0%
think that would be good and the timing
 
01:58:38.089 --> 01:58:38.099 align:start position:0%
would work out very well I know uh
 
01:58:39.709 --> 01:58:39.719 align:start position:0%
all this talk on meals and wheels has
 
01:58:42.010 --> 01:58:42.020 align:start position:0%
made some of us hungry but we're
 
01:58:44.930 --> 01:58:44.940 align:start position:0%
I think that would work out fantastic so
 
01:58:46.490 --> 01:58:46.500 align:start position:0%
welcome Gina you're always welcome
 
01:58:50.270 --> 01:58:50.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:52.129 --> 01:58:52.139 align:start position:0%
just be sure to make sure the
 
01:58:55.129 --> 01:58:55.139 align:start position:0%
microphone's on and very close to you so
 
01:58:59.089 --> 01:58:59.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:00.830 --> 01:59:00.840 align:start position:0%
Home Care hospice and palliative care
 
01:59:02.510 --> 01:59:02.520 align:start position:0%
Alliance of New Hampshire and our
 
01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:04.380 align:start position:0%
advocacy affiliate the granite state
 
01:59:06.890 --> 01:59:06.900 align:start position:0%
home health and hospice Association I
 
01:59:08.870 --> 01:59:08.880 align:start position:0%
just wanted to follow up this morning's
 
01:59:12.169 --> 01:59:12.179 align:start position:0%
conversation with one with one point
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
um in the uh the budget book I believe
 
01:59:19.669 --> 01:59:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's on page 11.
 
01:59:23.870 --> 01:59:23.880 align:start position:0%
uh underneath at the very bottom of the
 
01:59:27.169 --> 01:59:27.179 align:start position:0%
page under prioritized need it says that
 
01:59:29.950 --> 01:59:29.960 align:start position:0%
DHHS does not have a wait list for those
 
01:59:33.530 --> 01:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
requesting Services Under the CFI waiver
 
01:59:35.149 --> 01:59:35.159 align:start position:0%
and additional funds are required to
 
01:59:37.430 --> 01:59:37.440 align:start position:0%
meet increased caseload needs and access
 
01:59:40.070 --> 01:59:40.080 align:start position:0%
to Services I think it's important to
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
understand that I would agree there's no
 
01:59:45.729 --> 01:59:45.739 align:start position:0%
wait list for people requesting services
 
01:59:49.430 --> 01:59:49.440 align:start position:0%
that one can apply to CFI and be
 
01:59:52.310 --> 01:59:52.320 align:start position:0%
determined eligible that does not mean
 
01:59:53.870 --> 01:59:53.880 align:start position:0%
that and that you're going to get
 
01:59:53.880 --> 01:59:55.010 align:start position:0%
that and that you're going to get
services

01:59:55.010 --> 01:59:55.020 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:57.300 align:start position:0%
and I think that's just important for
 
01:59:59.510 --> 01:59:59.520 align:start position:0%
the committee to understand as I
 
02:00:02.750 --> 02:00:02.760 align:start position:0%
mentioned last week the utilization rate
 
02:00:08.510 --> 02:00:08.520 align:start position:0%
in fiscal year 2022 was on average 66
 
02:00:11.390 --> 02:00:11.400 align:start position:0%
percent of the authorized services that
 
02:00:14.390 --> 02:00:14.400 align:start position:0%
that clients needed and depending on the
 
02:00:17.089 --> 02:00:17.099 align:start position:0%
service that you need in CFI it could be
 
02:00:18.229 --> 02:00:18.239 align:start position:0%
much less
 
02:00:21.350 --> 02:00:21.360 align:start position:0%
you know could be about 50 percent of
 
02:00:24.890 --> 02:00:24.900 align:start position:0%
your services if you're new to CFI
 
02:00:27.649 --> 02:00:27.659 align:start position:0%
I think it would you should talk to the
 
02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:29.880 align:start position:0%
independent case managers they will tell
 
02:00:32.450 --> 02:00:32.460 align:start position:0%
you that they cannot Place see they
 
02:00:34.729 --> 02:00:34.739 align:start position:0%
cannot arrange CFI services
 
02:00:37.430 --> 02:00:37.440 align:start position:0%
home care agencies cannot take on new
 
02:00:40.850 --> 02:00:40.860 align:start position:0%
clients and that's just the reality and
 
02:00:42.410 --> 02:00:42.420 align:start position:0%
I think that um
 
02:00:44.930 --> 02:00:44.940 align:start position:0%
Amy Moore was with me last week from a
 
02:00:47.870 --> 02:00:47.880 align:start position:0%
century In-Home Care her agency turns
 
02:00:51.169 --> 02:00:51.179 align:start position:0%
away 40 to 50 clients a month from CFI
 
02:00:53.570 --> 02:00:53.580 align:start position:0%
because they do not have the staff to
 
02:00:55.550 --> 02:00:55.560 align:start position:0%
provide services so I just want to
 
02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
clarify that I would agree that
 
02:01:00.350 --> 02:01:00.360 align:start position:0%
additional funds are required to
 
02:01:02.689 --> 02:01:02.699 align:start position:0%
increase access to services and that's
 
02:01:04.609 --> 02:01:04.619 align:start position:0%
what we spoke about last week when I
 
02:01:08.330 --> 02:01:08.340 align:start position:0%
came in with the requested rates and
 
02:01:10.129 --> 02:01:10.139 align:start position:0%
once again we're looking to have those
 
02:01:11.750 --> 02:01:11.760 align:start position:0%
rates raised
 
02:01:14.689 --> 02:01:14.699 align:start position:0%
to be comparable with the title 20 and
 
02:01:17.089 --> 02:01:17.099 align:start position:0%
3B rates so I think
 
02:01:19.310 --> 02:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
um that's I hope that you'll take a look
 
02:01:21.050 --> 02:01:21.060 align:start position:0%
at that presentation again and
 
02:01:23.149 --> 02:01:23.159 align:start position:0%
specifically Helen in on those rates and
 
02:01:24.290 --> 02:01:24.300 align:start position:0%
with that
 
02:01:25.729 --> 02:01:25.739 align:start position:0%
unless there are questions I'll let you
 
02:01:27.770 --> 02:01:27.780 align:start position:0%
go to lunch
 
02:01:31.189 --> 02:01:31.199 align:start position:0%
any questions for MS baucus
 
02:01:33.350 --> 02:01:33.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so much for your time
 
02:01:34.729 --> 02:01:34.739 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:37.669 --> 02:01:37.679 align:start position:0%
any further yes
 
02:01:40.910 --> 02:01:40.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely is it Mr Cahoon yes
 
02:01:53.810 --> 02:01:53.820 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:55.189 --> 02:01:55.199 align:start position:0%
um thank you madam chair my name is Gary
 
02:01:57.770 --> 02:01:57.780 align:start position:0%
Cahoon I'm here representing the New
 
02:02:00.229 --> 02:02:00.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association a residential care
 
02:02:02.510 --> 02:02:02.520 align:start position:0%
homes and
 
02:02:04.970 --> 02:02:04.980 align:start position:0%
um Gina just talked about unprovided
 
02:02:06.649 --> 02:02:06.659 align:start position:0%
Services services that were authorized
 
02:02:08.330 --> 02:02:08.340 align:start position:0%
but not provided because the providers
 
02:02:09.530 --> 02:02:09.540 align:start position:0%
weren't available
 
02:02:12.250 --> 02:02:12.260 align:start position:0%
to a degree that can be Quantified
 
02:02:15.229 --> 02:02:15.239 align:start position:0%
for CFI Home Services
 
02:02:18.470 --> 02:02:18.480 align:start position:0%
the same situation exists with CFI
 
02:02:20.390 --> 02:02:20.400 align:start position:0%
residential care services but it can't
 
02:02:22.370 --> 02:02:22.380 align:start position:0%
be Quantified in the same way
 
02:02:25.010 --> 02:02:25.020 align:start position:0%
and the reason is and I I think I try to
 
02:02:26.330 --> 02:02:26.340 align:start position:0%
make this point last week but I just
 
02:02:28.250 --> 02:02:28.260 align:start position:0%
want to be sure that I was clear
 
02:02:30.470 --> 02:02:30.480 align:start position:0%
the services are not authorized until a
 
02:02:31.850 --> 02:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
bet is found
 
02:02:34.910 --> 02:02:34.920 align:start position:0%
so if there is a CFI client who the case
 
02:02:37.790 --> 02:02:37.800 align:start position:0%
management team decides is best served
 
02:02:40.850 --> 02:02:40.860 align:start position:0%
in a residential care setting
 
02:02:42.589 --> 02:02:42.599 align:start position:0%
they then look for a residential care
 
02:02:45.530 --> 02:02:45.540 align:start position:0%
bed but that residential care service is
 
02:02:45.540 --> 02:02:46.870 align:start position:0%
bed but that residential care service is
not

02:02:46.870 --> 02:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
not
 
02:02:50.209 --> 02:02:50.219 align:start position:0%
authorized until the bet is found so a
 
02:02:52.430 --> 02:02:52.440 align:start position:0%
hundred percent virtually of authorized
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
services are met but it's not because
 
02:02:57.350 --> 02:02:57.360 align:start position:0%
100 of the need is met nowhere close to
 
02:03:00.050 --> 02:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
100 of the need I suspect in fact that
 
02:03:02.209 --> 02:03:02.219 align:start position:0%
the unmet need is greater than it is for
 
02:03:03.709 --> 02:03:03.719 align:start position:0%
home care services
 
02:03:05.810 --> 02:03:05.820 align:start position:0%
but there's only anecdotal evidence to
 
02:03:07.129 --> 02:03:07.139 align:start position:0%
us to
 
02:03:10.129 --> 02:03:10.139 align:start position:0%

sorry

02:05:08.570 --> 02:05:08.580 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:08.580 --> 02:10:19.310 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

02:10:19.310 --> 02:10:19.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:19.320 --> 03:01:54.889 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:01:54.889 --> 03:01:54.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:02:00.230 --> 03:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
noticed on House Bill 2 5 27 relative to
 
03:02:02.410 --> 03:02:02.420 align:start position:0%
Medicaid reimbursement rates for certain
 
03:02:06.889 --> 03:02:06.899 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities so uh before
 
03:02:09.889 --> 03:02:09.899 align:start position:0%
we begin I just want to give a brief uh
 
03:02:11.809 --> 03:02:11.819 align:start position:0%
legislative history of the bill so we
 
03:02:13.929 --> 03:02:13.939 align:start position:0%
all know where we are
 
03:02:17.570 --> 03:02:17.580 align:start position:0%
the bill came to finance first so this
 
03:02:21.110 --> 03:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
is not from a second commit City it came
 
03:02:22.730 --> 03:02:22.740 align:start position:0%
directly to finance it had a public
 
03:02:26.030 --> 03:02:26.040 align:start position:0%
hearing on the 9th of February and then
 
03:02:29.510 --> 03:02:29.520 align:start position:0%
a division work session also on the 9th
 
03:02:31.790 --> 03:02:31.800 align:start position:0%
of February
 
03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:33.170 align:start position:0%
of February
um

03:02:33.170 --> 03:02:33.180 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:02:36.110 --> 03:02:36.120 align:start position:0%
or rather I guess on the on the 27th is
 
03:02:37.969 --> 03:02:37.979 align:start position:0%
that right Mr Ripple
 
03:02:39.950 --> 03:02:39.960 align:start position:0%
it looks like a yes okay on the on the
 
03:02:42.170 --> 03:02:42.180 align:start position:0%
27th of February was the first work
 
03:02:44.990 --> 03:02:45.000 align:start position:0%
session so then that leads us to this
 
03:02:47.269 --> 03:02:47.279 align:start position:0%
work session today
 
03:02:50.030 --> 03:02:50.040 align:start position:0%
and where we left off from the previous
 
03:02:54.349 --> 03:02:54.359 align:start position:0%
work session is an amendment that was
 
03:02:57.590 --> 03:02:57.600 align:start position:0%
brought to us by the two Bill sponsors
 
03:02:59.870 --> 03:02:59.880 align:start position:0%
one of which is here today that is
 
03:03:03.889 --> 03:03:03.899 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:09.110 --> 03:03:09.120 align:start position:0%
hyphen zero four five six H does
 
03:03:12.230 --> 03:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
everybody have a copy of that I think
 
03:03:15.769 --> 03:03:15.779 align:start position:0%
that will be the focal point of our
 
03:03:19.790 --> 03:03:19.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:03:22.309 --> 03:03:22.319 align:start position:0%
just want to uh it's
 
03:03:25.730 --> 03:03:25.740 align:start position:0%
actually not on the dock it online
 
03:03:28.849 --> 03:03:28.859 align:start position:0%
so it must just be within the committee
 
03:03:30.769 --> 03:03:30.779 align:start position:0%
are you making copies Mr Ripple oh thank
 
03:03:33.290 --> 03:03:33.300 align:start position:0%
you very much I appreciate that
 
03:03:35.389 --> 03:03:35.399 align:start position:0%
um so that will be the focal point of
 
03:03:37.429 --> 03:03:37.439 align:start position:0%
our work session today is that Amendment
 
03:03:39.710 --> 03:03:39.720 align:start position:0%
as I understand it a lot of new
 
03:03:43.550 --> 03:03:43.560 align:start position:0%
information has been discovered upon the
 
03:03:43.560 --> 03:03:44.630 align:start position:0%
information has been discovered upon the
initial

03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:44.640 align:start position:0%
initial
 
03:03:46.790 --> 03:03:46.800 align:start position:0%
introduction of the bill and so it's
 
03:03:49.010 --> 03:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
important that we consider this
 
03:03:51.349 --> 03:03:51.359 align:start position:0%
amendment before moving forward
 
03:03:54.950 --> 03:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
so uh once Mr Ripple comes back we'll
 
03:03:56.929 --> 03:03:56.939 align:start position:0%
hear I think first approach most
 
03:03:58.309 --> 03:03:58.319 align:start position:0%
appropriately from representative
 
03:04:01.010 --> 03:04:01.020 align:start position:0%
Horrigan who is a sponsor of the bill
 
03:04:03.349 --> 03:04:03.359 align:start position:0%
and a sponsor of the amendment so if
 
03:04:04.969 --> 03:04:04.979 align:start position:0%
you'd like to make yourself comfortable
 
03:04:07.730 --> 03:04:07.740 align:start position:0%
Mr Horrigan we will be hearing you
 
03:04:07.740 --> 03:04:09.590 align:start position:0%
Mr Horrigan we will be hearing you
momentarily

03:04:09.590 --> 03:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
momentarily
 
03:04:11.809 --> 03:04:11.819 align:start position:0%
prior to hearing the representative are
 
03:04:13.790 --> 03:04:13.800 align:start position:0%
there any initial thoughts or comments
 
03:04:16.010 --> 03:04:16.020 align:start position:0%
or questions or directions we want to go
 
03:04:18.950 --> 03:04:18.960 align:start position:0%
from the members of the committee
 
03:04:23.150 --> 03:04:23.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:25.370 --> 03:04:25.380 align:start position:0%
and just um again because that
 
03:04:28.910 --> 03:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:04:31.190 --> 03:04:31.200 align:start position:0%
you could perhaps start representative
 
03:04:33.590 --> 03:04:33.600 align:start position:0%
Horrigan but know that not everybody has
 
03:04:35.510 --> 03:04:35.520 align:start position:0%
a copy at this particular point where
 
03:04:37.190 --> 03:04:37.200 align:start position:0%
copies provided at the tail end of the
 
03:04:42.349 --> 03:04:42.359 align:start position:0%
works at the public hearing yes uh in
 
03:04:44.030 --> 03:04:44.040 align:start position:0%
any case yeah I'm sure some members do
 
03:04:47.450 --> 03:04:47.460 align:start position:0%
have this started with uh HP 527 a
 
03:04:49.849 --> 03:04:49.859 align:start position:0%
request to expand their Medicaid rates
 
03:04:53.750 --> 03:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh for assisted living facilities small
 
03:04:56.510 --> 03:04:56.520 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities 16 beds or
 
03:04:56.520 --> 03:04:58.429 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities 16 beds or
less

03:04:58.429 --> 03:04:58.439 align:start position:0%
less
 
03:05:00.530 --> 03:05:00.540 align:start position:0%
happy to get closer I think to the
 
03:05:00.540 --> 03:05:02.929 align:start position:0%
happy to get closer I think to the
microphone

03:05:02.929 --> 03:05:02.939 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:05.750 --> 03:05:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's better thank you
 
03:05:05.760 --> 03:05:09.769 align:start position:0%
that's better thank you
uh

03:05:09.769 --> 03:05:09.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:05:12.889 --> 03:05:12.899 align:start position:0%
as a result of the public hearing and
 
03:05:14.690 --> 03:05:14.700 align:start position:0%
the folks sitting behind me here we
 
03:05:16.730 --> 03:05:16.740 align:start position:0%
learned some things that prompted us to
 
03:05:18.469 --> 03:05:18.479 align:start position:0%
make an amendment which is what you're
 
03:05:20.110 --> 03:05:20.120 align:start position:0%
looking at today
 
03:05:23.690 --> 03:05:23.700 align:start position:0%
but the only change was to
 
03:05:26.750 --> 03:05:26.760 align:start position:0%
identify the license that particularly
 
03:05:28.910 --> 03:05:28.920 align:start position:0%
applied to my constituent which was the
 
03:05:32.269 --> 03:05:32.279 align:start position:0%
HP or Hep 804
 
03:05:35.030 --> 03:05:35.040 align:start position:0%
uh so that's what was added when the
 
03:05:36.290 --> 03:05:36.300 align:start position:0%
amendment was
 
03:05:36.300 --> 03:05:38.269 align:start position:0%
amendment was
created

03:05:38.269 --> 03:05:38.279 align:start position:0%
created
 
03:05:40.969 --> 03:05:40.979 align:start position:0%
527 is still a request to increase the
 
03:05:42.530 --> 03:05:42.540 align:start position:0%
rates on the assisted living facilities
 
03:05:45.410 --> 03:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
for 16 beds or less 50 Medicaid
 
03:05:45.420 --> 03:05:47.870 align:start position:0%
for 16 beds or less 50 Medicaid
occupancy

03:05:47.870 --> 03:05:47.880 align:start position:0%
occupancy
 
03:05:49.130 --> 03:05:49.140 align:start position:0%
and then
 
03:05:51.349 --> 03:05:51.359 align:start position:0%
as it applies to that specific license
 
03:05:53.510 --> 03:05:53.520 align:start position:0%
and one of the things I learned at the
 
03:05:55.250 --> 03:05:55.260 align:start position:0%
public hearing was that these they
 
03:05:55.260 --> 03:05:56.090 align:start position:0%
public hearing was that these they
weren't

03:05:56.090 --> 03:05:56.100 align:start position:0%
weren't
 
03:05:58.790 --> 03:05:58.800 align:start position:0%
quite a number of licenses and they are
 
03:06:00.950 --> 03:06:00.960 align:start position:0%
applied based on the
 
03:06:03.110 --> 03:06:03.120 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the level of care
 
03:06:05.210 --> 03:06:05.220 align:start position:0%
that the facility provides
 
03:06:08.750 --> 03:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
but the issue here was 16 beds or less
 
03:06:14.030 --> 03:06:14.040 align:start position:0%
50 Medicaid occupancy and uh because my
 
03:06:14.040 --> 03:06:15.290 align:start position:0%
50 Medicaid occupancy and uh because my
constituents

03:06:15.290 --> 03:06:15.300 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
03:06:18.590 --> 03:06:18.600 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living care facility is an 804
 
03:06:21.349 --> 03:06:21.359 align:start position:0%
we're specifically requesting for a rate
 
03:06:25.490 --> 03:06:25.500 align:start position:0%
increase for the rate up for the 804.
 
03:06:29.450 --> 03:06:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:06:32.389 --> 03:06:32.399 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative so to sort
 
03:06:34.070 --> 03:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
of get our bearings here in this work
 
03:06:36.830 --> 03:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
session it's pretty clear that the
 
03:06:39.349 --> 03:06:39.359 align:start position:0%
original language of the bill is not
 
03:06:41.710 --> 03:06:41.720 align:start position:0%
going to work no matter what
 
03:06:45.650 --> 03:06:45.660 align:start position:0%
primarily because the phrase and the
 
03:06:48.650 --> 03:06:48.660 align:start position:0%
term small assisted living facilities is
 
03:06:51.110 --> 03:06:51.120 align:start position:0%
not defined in the law and thus your
 
03:06:51.120 --> 03:06:52.870 align:start position:0%
not defined in the law and thus your
Amendment

03:06:52.870 --> 03:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
03:06:56.570 --> 03:06:56.580 align:start position:0%
is the purpose of that was to Define
 
03:06:59.030 --> 03:06:59.040 align:start position:0%
what your constituent was looking for
 
03:07:04.429 --> 03:07:04.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:07:06.650 --> 03:07:06.660 align:start position:0%
correct representative erf for a
 
03:07:06.660 --> 03:07:08.450 align:start position:0%
correct representative erf for a
question

03:07:08.450 --> 03:07:08.460 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:07:12.950 --> 03:07:12.960 align:start position:0%
so that license it's ep84 that
 
03:07:17.210 --> 03:07:17.220 align:start position:0%
is specific to the size as well
 
03:07:18.830 --> 03:07:18.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the questions I understand
 
03:07:22.550 --> 03:07:22.560 align:start position:0%
it 804 specifically refers to by
 
03:07:22.560 --> 03:07:23.809 align:start position:0%
it 804 specifically refers to by
constituents

03:07:23.809 --> 03:07:23.819 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
03:07:25.790 --> 03:07:25.800 align:start position:0%
assisted living facility
 
03:07:27.650 --> 03:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
I agree with that but I think it covers
 
03:07:29.090 --> 03:07:29.100 align:start position:0%
many more than your constituents I
 
03:07:31.969 --> 03:07:31.979 align:start position:0%
believe it does too but I do not
 
03:07:34.250 --> 03:07:34.260 align:start position:0%
know personally that I can't answer that
 
03:07:35.929 --> 03:07:35.939 align:start position:0%
question and say yes it does okay
 
03:07:37.190 --> 03:07:37.200 align:start position:0%
there's probably somebody here who can
 
03:07:38.510 --> 03:07:38.520 align:start position:0%
answer that but I don't believe it's
 
03:07:40.250 --> 03:07:40.260 align:start position:0%
size specific I think it's more
 
03:07:42.349 --> 03:07:42.359 align:start position:0%
functional specific correct that's my
 
03:07:45.170 --> 03:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
understanding okay
 
03:07:48.410 --> 03:07:48.420 align:start position:0%
now representative also uh we have
 
03:07:50.570 --> 03:07:50.580 align:start position:0%
you've heard testimony at our previous
 
03:07:53.929 --> 03:07:53.939 align:start position:0%
work session uh from somebody who had
 
03:07:56.150 --> 03:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
mentioned that if we're going to raise
 
03:07:59.030 --> 03:07:59.040 align:start position:0%
the rates for one we should raise it for
 
03:07:59.040 --> 03:08:00.170 align:start position:0%
the rates for one we should raise it for
all

03:08:00.170 --> 03:08:00.180 align:start position:0%
all
 
03:08:02.389 --> 03:08:02.399 align:start position:0%
and that would include everybody under
 
03:08:05.750 --> 03:08:05.760 align:start position:0%
this particular licensee and if we were
 
03:08:08.210 --> 03:08:08.220 align:start position:0%
to go that route that would
 
03:08:10.910 --> 03:08:10.920 align:start position:0%
substantially change the fiscal note for
 
03:08:13.070 --> 03:08:13.080 align:start position:0%
example and the bill in general do you
 
03:08:15.590 --> 03:08:15.600 align:start position:0%
want to expand on that
 
03:08:15.600 --> 03:08:18.130 align:start position:0%
want to expand on that
foreign

03:08:18.130 --> 03:08:18.140 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:08:20.990 --> 03:08:21.000 align:start position:0%
my constituent I
 
03:08:23.389 --> 03:08:23.399 align:start position:0%
don't want to predict what the finance
 
03:08:25.490 --> 03:08:25.500 align:start position:0%
people would do I know it would
 
03:08:27.349 --> 03:08:27.359 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the bottom line
 
03:08:27.359 --> 03:08:28.269 align:start position:0%
significantly increase the bottom line
there

03:08:28.269 --> 03:08:28.279 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:08:30.950 --> 03:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
because as I understand it the rates
 
03:08:32.570 --> 03:08:32.580 align:start position:0%
vary depending on the level of the
 
03:08:32.580 --> 03:08:33.530 align:start position:0%
vary depending on the level of the
license

03:08:33.530 --> 03:08:33.540 align:start position:0%
license
 
03:08:35.990 --> 03:08:36.000 align:start position:0%
uh in the size of the facility I'm not
 
03:08:38.510 --> 03:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
quite sure how that works uh but I do
 
03:08:41.110 --> 03:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
believe that if
 
03:08:44.570 --> 03:08:44.580 align:start position:0%
they were to increase the rates it would
 
03:08:44.580 --> 03:08:45.830 align:start position:0%
they were to increase the rates it would
incorporate

03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
incorporate
 
03:08:49.490 --> 03:08:49.500 align:start position:0%
more than my constituents facility
 
03:08:53.330 --> 03:08:53.340 align:start position:0%
and that 10.5 I think as I understand it
 
03:08:55.790 --> 03:08:55.800 align:start position:0%
as I interpret it it would be all
 
03:08:58.190 --> 03:08:58.200 align:start position:0%
assisted living facilities with 16 beds
 
03:08:59.570 --> 03:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
or less
 
03:09:02.870 --> 03:09:02.880 align:start position:0%
however many there are
 
03:09:04.790 --> 03:09:04.800 align:start position:0%
and I think that's what a 10.6 million
 
03:09:05.809 --> 03:09:05.819 align:start position:0%
comes off
 
03:09:07.429 --> 03:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
because the request I think works out
 
03:09:13.730 --> 03:09:13.740 align:start position:0%
through about 3 500 roughly a month
 
03:09:16.070 --> 03:09:16.080 align:start position:0%
41 000 a year
 
03:09:18.110 --> 03:09:18.120 align:start position:0%
times whatever number of facilities I
 
03:09:19.910 --> 03:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
think is how that 10.6 million dollars
 
03:09:21.530 --> 03:09:21.540 align:start position:0%
came up
 
03:09:23.929 --> 03:09:23.939 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
03:09:26.570 --> 03:09:26.580 align:start position:0%
um yeah my understanding was that
 
03:09:28.730 --> 03:09:28.740 align:start position:0%
um you know this daily rate is is a
 
03:09:31.429 --> 03:09:31.439 align:start position:0%
standard service provided by
 
03:09:33.530 --> 03:09:33.540 align:start position:0%
State and I don't know if anybody here
 
03:09:36.349 --> 03:09:36.359 align:start position:0%
that can talk about it from DHHS so
 
03:09:38.870 --> 03:09:38.880 align:start position:0%
therefore basically it would require a
 
03:09:41.630 --> 03:09:41.640 align:start position:0%
structural change in the way that the
 
03:09:43.190 --> 03:09:43.200 align:start position:0%
law is set up and perhaps even
 
03:09:46.550 --> 03:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
negotiating uh uh with CMS or the
 
03:09:50.150 --> 03:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
federal government I believe in order to
 
03:09:50.160 --> 03:09:51.590 align:start position:0%
federal government I believe in order to
um

03:09:51.590 --> 03:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:09:52.610 --> 03:09:52.620 align:start position:0%
um you know set up different
 
03:09:54.230 --> 03:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
classifications and have different
 
03:09:57.590 --> 03:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
classification rules for for providing
 
03:10:00.469 --> 03:10:00.479 align:start position:0%
the same service
 
03:10:03.170 --> 03:10:03.180 align:start position:0%
um and um uh at least I think that's
 
03:10:05.090 --> 03:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
kind of where we were toward the end of
 
03:10:08.450 --> 03:10:08.460 align:start position:0%
the the last session that we had
 
03:10:09.830 --> 03:10:09.840 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:10:11.510 --> 03:10:11.520 align:start position:0%
um if you're providing the same service
 
03:10:15.010 --> 03:10:15.020 align:start position:0%
whether it's 90 Medicaid or one percent
 
03:10:17.809 --> 03:10:17.819 align:start position:0%
uh Medicaid it would have the same rate
 
03:10:21.469 --> 03:10:21.479 align:start position:0%
per day for that particular service for
 
03:10:23.210 --> 03:10:23.220 align:start position:0%
whatever facility that applies to
 
03:10:27.110 --> 03:10:27.120 align:start position:0%
whether it's you know 804 805.
 
03:10:29.690 --> 03:10:29.700 align:start position:0%
um and um and you know I know you're
 
03:10:32.170 --> 03:10:32.180 align:start position:0%
doing a great job supporting your
 
03:10:35.090 --> 03:10:35.100 align:start position:0%
constituents and and yeah and you're
 
03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
you're learning about this at the same
 
03:10:39.410 --> 03:10:39.420 align:start position:0%
rate that we are so but is there
 
03:10:39.420 --> 03:10:40.730 align:start position:0%
rate that we are so but is there
anything

03:10:40.730 --> 03:10:40.740 align:start position:0%
anything
 
03:10:43.309 --> 03:10:43.319 align:start position:0%
um you know first of all that that I've
 
03:10:45.530 --> 03:10:45.540 align:start position:0%
said that is inconsistent with what you
 
03:10:48.889 --> 03:10:48.899 align:start position:0%
understand and you know I hope that uh
 
03:10:51.710 --> 03:10:51.720 align:start position:0%
if there are people from the Department
 
03:10:53.990 --> 03:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
that could further clarify that or
 
03:10:56.330 --> 03:10:56.340 align:start position:0%
confirm that that we could get to that
 
03:10:59.090 --> 03:10:59.100 align:start position:0%
direction too thank you my understanding
 
03:11:02.469 --> 03:11:02.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:05.510 --> 03:11:05.520 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for the
 
03:11:05.520 --> 03:11:07.550 align:start position:0%
okay any other questions for the
representative

03:11:07.550 --> 03:11:07.560 align:start position:0%
representative
 
03:11:09.050 --> 03:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
all right thank you so much
 
03:11:10.190 --> 03:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
representative for coming and
 
03:11:13.730 --> 03:11:13.740 align:start position:0%
rescheduling taking the time for us
 
03:11:15.889 --> 03:11:15.899 align:start position:0%
appreciate that Mr Ripple we could just
 
03:11:17.450 --> 03:11:17.460 align:start position:0%
one more copy of that Amendment over
 
03:11:20.030 --> 03:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
here that would be fantastic okay uh
 
03:11:23.269 --> 03:11:23.279 align:start position:0%
next to uh testify on the bill
 
03:11:23.279 --> 03:11:24.590 align:start position:0%
next to uh testify on the bill
did

03:11:24.590 --> 03:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
did
 
03:11:24.600 --> 03:11:25.490 align:start position:0%
did
um

03:11:25.490 --> 03:11:25.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:28.610 --> 03:11:28.620 align:start position:0%
from the Department of HHS did you wanna
 
03:11:30.469 --> 03:11:30.479 align:start position:0%
come up I know I myself have a couple of
 
03:11:32.330 --> 03:11:32.340 align:start position:0%
questions I'm sure others do as well if
 
03:11:34.370 --> 03:11:34.380 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with that
 
03:11:34.380 --> 03:11:36.050 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with that
foreign

03:11:36.050 --> 03:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
03:11:37.610 --> 03:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
if you could just state your name for
 
03:11:41.210 --> 03:11:41.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:42.889 --> 03:11:42.899 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Madam chair members of
 
03:11:44.269 --> 03:11:44.279 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Rob Berry I'm
 
03:11:46.730 --> 03:11:46.740 align:start position:0%
general counsel to the division of
 
03:11:47.870 --> 03:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
Medicaid with New Hampshire Department
 
03:11:49.670 --> 03:11:49.680 align:start position:0%
of Health Team services
 
03:11:51.410 --> 03:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
I'm Christy Roy with rate setting for
 
03:11:52.250 --> 03:11:52.260 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
 
03:11:52.260 --> 03:11:53.690 align:start position:0%
the Department of Health and Human
Services

03:11:53.690 --> 03:11:53.700 align:start position:0%
Services
 
03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:55.080 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I don't know if you
 
03:11:56.870 --> 03:11:56.880 align:start position:0%
have any initial thoughts on the bill
 
03:11:59.330 --> 03:11:59.340 align:start position:0%
however I myself am very curious in
 
03:12:02.389 --> 03:12:02.399 align:start position:0%
terms of this classification of Hep 804
 
03:12:04.670 --> 03:12:04.680 align:start position:0%
how many facilities in New Hampshire
 
03:12:07.849 --> 03:12:07.859 align:start position:0%
fall under that classification sure so
 
03:12:10.130 --> 03:12:10.140 align:start position:0%
the department is here to be helpful uh
 
03:12:12.490 --> 03:12:12.500 align:start position:0%
to this process I I did want to note
 
03:12:14.929 --> 03:12:14.939 align:start position:0%
that the Department's initial fiscal
 
03:12:18.710 --> 03:12:18.720 align:start position:0%
analysis assumed that everybody would go
 
03:12:21.710 --> 03:12:21.720 align:start position:0%
to the 115 dollar rate in the initial
 
03:12:26.090 --> 03:12:26.100 align:start position:0%
bill so that would be Hep 804 and 805s
 
03:12:27.769 --> 03:12:27.779 align:start position:0%
um so I just want to throw that out
 
03:12:31.450 --> 03:12:31.460 align:start position:0%
there that that is a high
 
03:12:34.610 --> 03:12:34.620 align:start position:0%
amount at the moment and can be adjusted
 
03:12:36.710 --> 03:12:36.720 align:start position:0%
our recommendation from the Department's
 
03:12:39.410 --> 03:12:39.420 align:start position:0%
perspective is to uniformly increase the
 
03:12:41.990 --> 03:12:42.000 align:start position:0%
rate by a certain percentage to be
 
03:12:44.990 --> 03:12:45.000 align:start position:0%
decided by this committee
 
03:12:48.170 --> 03:12:48.180 align:start position:0%
um across all three levels of care
 
03:12:50.330 --> 03:12:50.340 align:start position:0%
that's our recommendation and we can
 
03:12:53.269 --> 03:12:53.279 align:start position:0%
provide some idea of what that might
 
03:12:55.210 --> 03:12:55.220 align:start position:0%
look like based on certain percentages
 
03:12:57.349 --> 03:12:57.359 align:start position:0%
but to get back to your original
 
03:12:59.150 --> 03:12:59.160 align:start position:0%
question about how many Hep 804
 
03:13:01.969 --> 03:13:01.979 align:start position:0%
facilities there are I am doing some
 
03:13:07.010 --> 03:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
rough math so I I do want to couch that
 
03:13:13.550 --> 03:13:13.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:15.710 --> 03:13:15.720 align:start position:0%
now keep in mind that not all are going
 
03:13:17.410 --> 03:13:17.420 align:start position:0%
to have Medicaid
 
03:13:20.210 --> 03:13:20.220 align:start position:0%
individuals within that facility as well
 
03:13:20.220 --> 03:13:21.349 align:start position:0%
individuals within that facility as well
so

03:13:21.349 --> 03:13:21.359 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:13:23.210 --> 03:13:23.220 align:start position:0%
understood representative Wallner for a
 
03:13:23.220 --> 03:13:23.870 align:start position:0%
understood representative Wallner for a
question

03:13:23.870 --> 03:13:23.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:13:26.929 --> 03:13:26.939 align:start position:0%
yes I I was wondering where where would
 
03:13:31.730 --> 03:13:31.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:34.250 --> 03:13:34.260 align:start position:0%
CFI they're under choice for
 
03:13:36.469 --> 03:13:36.479 align:start position:0%
Independence so they're mixed in with
 
03:13:38.210 --> 03:13:38.220 align:start position:0%
the other bills that are hurt for
 
03:13:40.309 --> 03:13:40.319 align:start position:0%
choices for Independence I believe
 
03:13:42.469 --> 03:13:42.479 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
03:13:44.809 --> 03:13:44.819 align:start position:0%
representative erf for a question
 
03:13:46.370 --> 03:13:46.380 align:start position:0%
what is the third license that you
 
03:13:47.830 --> 03:13:47.840 align:start position:0%
referred to there's
 
03:13:50.750 --> 03:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
80485 and well 805 is supported
 
03:13:52.370 --> 03:13:52.380 align:start position:0%
residential care and that has both
 
03:13:55.429 --> 03:13:55.439 align:start position:0%
levels of of the other Acuity levels so
 
03:13:56.990 --> 03:13:57.000 align:start position:0%
that encompasses
 
03:13:58.610 --> 03:13:58.620 align:start position:0%
um dementia level one and dementia level
 
03:14:02.570 --> 03:14:02.580 align:start position:0%
two and then uh the AGP 804s are just
 
03:14:04.849 --> 03:14:04.859 align:start position:0%
the standard Residential Care assisted
 
03:14:07.790 --> 03:14:07.800 align:start position:0%
living facility okay so 805 has two sub
 
03:14:09.170 --> 03:14:09.180 align:start position:0%
if you will and each one of them has a
 
03:14:10.250 --> 03:14:10.260 align:start position:0%
different rate
 
03:14:13.309 --> 03:14:13.319 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct okay and if we did a
 
03:14:13.319 --> 03:14:15.110 align:start position:0%
yes that's correct okay and if we did a
percentage

03:14:15.110 --> 03:14:15.120 align:start position:0%
percentage
 
03:14:16.849 --> 03:14:16.859 align:start position:0%
it would get pretty
 
03:14:18.410 --> 03:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
phenomenal once you included those other
 
03:14:19.969 --> 03:14:19.979 align:start position:0%
ones wouldn't it or did you include all
 
03:14:21.170 --> 03:14:21.180 align:start position:0%
the did you include those both those
 
03:14:23.630 --> 03:14:23.640 align:start position:0%
under 805. we included everything so
 
03:14:26.389 --> 03:14:26.399 align:start position:0%
that the fiscal no analysis we worksheet
 
03:14:28.130 --> 03:14:28.140 align:start position:0%
analysis we did
 
03:14:30.410 --> 03:14:30.420 align:start position:0%
um took every assisted living facility
 
03:14:33.170 --> 03:14:33.180 align:start position:0%
804 805 regardless of the level of care
 
03:14:35.929 --> 03:14:35.939 align:start position:0%
and just bump the rate to 150 I believe
 
03:14:39.290 --> 03:14:39.300 align:start position:0%
it was so that's that's the top end okay
 
03:14:41.030 --> 03:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
so you didn't do the percentage
 
03:14:43.250 --> 03:14:43.260 align:start position:0%
calculation you just said would you
 
03:14:45.590 --> 03:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
which won't work correct
 
03:14:47.210 --> 03:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
you can't set them all the same rate can
 
03:14:47.220 --> 03:14:49.849 align:start position:0%
you can't set them all the same rate can
you

03:14:49.849 --> 03:14:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:53.150 --> 03:14:53.160 align:start position:0%
you could we don't think it would make a
 
03:14:55.550 --> 03:14:55.560 align:start position:0%
lot of sense given the
 
03:14:55.560 --> 03:14:56.570 align:start position:0%
lot of sense given the
um

03:14:56.570 --> 03:14:56.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:14:56.580 --> 03:14:58.370 align:start position:0%
um
um

03:14:58.370 --> 03:14:58.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:01.010 --> 03:15:01.020 align:start position:0%
the nature of the uh care that's
 
03:15:02.750 --> 03:15:02.760 align:start position:0%
provided let me ask a question a
 
03:15:04.670 --> 03:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
different way what's the ratio of the
 
03:15:06.530 --> 03:15:06.540 align:start position:0%
three right now from top to highest to
 
03:15:08.269 --> 03:15:08.279 align:start position:0%
lowest isn't it like a two or three to
 
03:15:08.279 --> 03:15:11.450 align:start position:0%
lowest isn't it like a two or three to
one

03:15:11.450 --> 03:15:11.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:16.910 --> 03:15:16.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:22.309 --> 03:15:22.319 align:start position:0%
So currently as of uh July 1st 2022
 
03:15:25.790 --> 03:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
the number in the Hep 804 for Medicaid
 
03:15:30.710 --> 03:15:30.720 align:start position:0%
beds is uh 89.35 of Medicaid eligible
 
03:15:34.190 --> 03:15:34.200 align:start position:0%
individuals dementia level one is 1.62
 
03:15:37.130 --> 03:15:37.140 align:start position:0%
for the population and dementia level 2
 
03:15:40.490 --> 03:15:40.500 align:start position:0%
is 7.22 percent
 
03:15:43.490 --> 03:15:43.500 align:start position:0%
way more than three to one like five to
 
03:15:46.370 --> 03:15:46.380 align:start position:0%
one maybe so roughly yeah I'm not very
 
03:15:47.990 --> 03:15:48.000 align:start position:0%
good with math so I'll defer to Christy
 
03:15:49.610 --> 03:15:49.620 align:start position:0%
over here
 
03:15:52.969 --> 03:15:52.979 align:start position:0%
most of the um the Assisted Living are
 
03:15:52.979 --> 03:15:56.809 align:start position:0%
most of the um the Assisted Living are
on

03:15:56.809 --> 03:15:56.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:15:58.610 --> 03:15:58.620 align:start position:0%
Venture level generally that would be
 
03:16:01.070 --> 03:16:01.080 align:start position:0%
nursing care above and beyond the
 
03:16:02.809 --> 03:16:02.819 align:start position:0%
Assisted Living so most of the
 
03:16:05.990 --> 03:16:06.000 align:start position:0%
population is that standard rate that is
 
03:16:07.790 --> 03:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
the 115 rate
 
03:16:09.230 --> 03:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
that we were talking about I understand
 
03:16:10.309 --> 03:16:10.319 align:start position:0%
that but if you're reciting them
 
03:16:12.769 --> 03:16:12.779 align:start position:0%
proportionally the top rate would be up
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
around the 700 and something dollar or
 
03:16:16.010 --> 03:16:16.020 align:start position:0%
eight hundred dollar
 
03:16:19.670 --> 03:16:19.680 align:start position:0%
based on what he just ran off there
 
03:16:21.170 --> 03:16:21.180 align:start position:0%
oh no he was talking about the
 
03:16:22.490 --> 03:16:22.500 align:start position:0%
percentage of
 
03:16:25.790 --> 03:16:25.800 align:start position:0%
um beds so he was saying 90 of beds are
 
03:16:28.370 --> 03:16:28.380 align:start position:0%
oh my question is what are the current
 
03:16:31.730 --> 03:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
rates oh okay I apologize the current
 
03:16:31.740 --> 03:16:33.530 align:start position:0%
rates oh okay I apologize the current
rates

03:16:33.530 --> 03:16:33.540 align:start position:0%
rates
 
03:16:36.170 --> 03:16:36.180 align:start position:0%
so the current rates are the 56.88 for
 
03:16:37.870 --> 03:16:37.880 align:start position:0%
the standard care
 
03:16:42.469 --> 03:16:42.479 align:start position:0%
84.74 for dementia 1 and 9541 for
 
03:16:45.349 --> 03:16:45.359 align:start position:0%
dementia 2. oh okay okay
 
03:16:47.150 --> 03:16:47.160 align:start position:0%
and for clarification what I gave us the
 
03:16:49.429 --> 03:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
percentage of the population I've got
 
03:16:50.809 --> 03:16:50.819 align:start position:0%
you okay
 
03:16:54.530 --> 03:16:54.540 align:start position:0%
so roughly two to one from heideloft
 
03:16:57.410 --> 03:16:57.420 align:start position:0%
not even that but still
 
03:16:59.210 --> 03:16:59.220 align:start position:0%
okay representative talerski for a
 
03:17:00.710 --> 03:17:00.720 align:start position:0%
question and then representative norgren
 
03:17:02.150 --> 03:17:02.160 align:start position:0%
my question was answered I wanted
 
03:17:03.950 --> 03:17:03.960 align:start position:0%
clarification on the first fiscal note
 
03:17:05.929 --> 03:17:05.939 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:17:11.330 --> 03:17:11.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:13.429 --> 03:17:13.439 align:start position:0%
pardon me thank you
 
03:17:18.650 --> 03:17:18.660 align:start position:0%
um so the fiscal note I have is 2 8 is
 
03:17:20.690 --> 03:17:20.700 align:start position:0%
that the current fiscal note or do we
 
03:17:22.910 --> 03:17:22.920 align:start position:0%
have a new fiscal note with it that's it
 
03:17:25.309 --> 03:17:25.319 align:start position:0%
okay all right thank you
 
03:17:28.730 --> 03:17:28.740 align:start position:0%
often we've had competing fiscal notes
 
03:17:37.730 --> 03:17:37.740 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:39.889 --> 03:17:39.899 align:start position:0%
I think salsa
 
03:17:42.410 --> 03:17:42.420 align:start position:0%
representative norgren you're all set
 
03:17:45.230 --> 03:17:45.240 align:start position:0%
yes thank you oh perfect all right okay
 
03:17:49.309 --> 03:17:49.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:17:51.610 --> 03:17:51.620 align:start position:0%
so now expanding on what we talked about
 
03:17:55.130 --> 03:17:55.140 align:start position:0%
this is changing rates in one
 
03:17:59.210 --> 03:17:59.220 align:start position:0%
various relatively small area of DHHS
 
03:18:01.790 --> 03:18:01.800 align:start position:0%
does that make sense relative to all the
 
03:18:04.550 --> 03:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
other rates across the I think it's a
 
03:18:09.469 --> 03:18:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:12.290 --> 03:18:12.300 align:start position:0%
I will note though that we do anticipate
 
03:18:13.969 --> 03:18:13.979 align:start position:0%
um the governor's budget the 3.1 percent
 
03:18:15.590 --> 03:18:15.600 align:start position:0%
would apply to assisted living
 
03:18:17.330 --> 03:18:17.340 align:start position:0%
facilities and there may be some other
 
03:18:18.530 --> 03:18:18.540 align:start position:0%
bills out there
 
03:18:20.990 --> 03:18:21.000 align:start position:0%
um in the Senate if I'm not mistaken
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
that do uh direct the department to
 
03:18:25.490 --> 03:18:25.500 align:start position:0%
increase rates as well
 
03:18:29.090 --> 03:18:29.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:32.269 --> 03:18:32.279 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham so um you know
 
03:18:34.429 --> 03:18:34.439 align:start position:0%
part part of the bill and I'm not sure
 
03:18:37.610 --> 03:18:37.620 align:start position:0%
about the amendment but talked about
 
03:18:40.250 --> 03:18:40.260 align:start position:0%
um having different rates for different
 
03:18:43.309 --> 03:18:43.319 align:start position:0%
facilities based on percent Medicaid so
 
03:18:45.650 --> 03:18:45.660 align:start position:0%
not necessarily applying to
 
03:18:47.870 --> 03:18:47.880 align:start position:0%
not necessarily applying to every
 
03:18:50.030 --> 03:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
incidence of
 
03:18:51.950 --> 03:18:51.960 align:start position:0%
um of you know what would be the
 
03:18:54.250 --> 03:18:54.260 align:start position:0%
non-dementia or standard care
 
03:18:56.870 --> 03:18:56.880 align:start position:0%
is that something that if we wanted to
 
03:19:00.889 --> 03:19:00.899 align:start position:0%
do could be implemented without going
 
03:19:03.889 --> 03:19:03.899 align:start position:0%
back to CMS
 
03:19:03.899 --> 03:19:05.210 align:start position:0%
back to CMS
or

03:19:05.210 --> 03:19:05.220 align:start position:0%
or
 
03:19:05.220 --> 03:19:07.309 align:start position:0%
or
no

03:19:07.309 --> 03:19:07.319 align:start position:0%
no
 
03:19:09.410 --> 03:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
um so in order to collect a federal
 
03:19:12.349 --> 03:19:12.359 align:start position:0%
match the rules for standard state plan
 
03:19:14.150 --> 03:19:14.160 align:start position:0%
Medicaid would be we have to public
 
03:19:16.370 --> 03:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
notice before that goes into place
 
03:19:18.110 --> 03:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
and then we have to do a state plan
 
03:19:19.790 --> 03:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
Amendment within the quarter that it
 
03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
goes into place and then of course they
 
03:19:24.469 --> 03:19:24.479 align:start position:0%
have to approve it so that's generally
 
03:19:26.630 --> 03:19:26.640 align:start position:0%
how it would have to work
 
03:19:28.429 --> 03:19:28.439 align:start position:0%
um with this particular rate it's all
 
03:19:30.110 --> 03:19:30.120 align:start position:0%
it's a waiver service so it's on the
 
03:19:32.630 --> 03:19:32.640 align:start position:0%
waiver and um my understanding of the
 
03:19:33.950 --> 03:19:33.960 align:start position:0%
methodology that's currently in the
 
03:19:36.469 --> 03:19:36.479 align:start position:0%
waiver is that it was set at a base rate
 
03:19:39.469 --> 03:19:39.479 align:start position:0%
as a point in time and then adjusted by
 
03:19:41.389 --> 03:19:41.399 align:start position:0%
a Market Basket inflation Factor but
 
03:19:42.950 --> 03:19:42.960 align:start position:0%
then there's a budget neutrality taken
 
03:19:45.410 --> 03:19:45.420 align:start position:0%
from it and that's
 
03:19:47.630 --> 03:19:47.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding of how the waiver rates
 
03:19:49.910 --> 03:19:49.920 align:start position:0%
are written in the waiver but it would
 
03:19:51.950 --> 03:19:51.960 align:start position:0%
need an amendment for changing the
 
03:19:51.960 --> 03:19:55.610 align:start position:0%
need an amendment for changing the
methodology

03:19:55.610 --> 03:19:55.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:55.620 --> 03:19:56.690 align:start position:0%
 
um so

03:19:56.690 --> 03:19:56.700 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:19:58.490 --> 03:19:58.500 align:start position:0%
um you know based on that I think your
 
03:20:00.349 --> 03:20:00.359 align:start position:0%
suggestion is if we wanted to make an
 
03:20:02.389 --> 03:20:02.399 align:start position:0%
adjustment in here we'd have to make an
 
03:20:04.969 --> 03:20:04.979 align:start position:0%
adjustment that would apply to everybody
 
03:20:07.910 --> 03:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
receiving these Services
 
03:20:10.070 --> 03:20:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and and
 
03:20:12.650 --> 03:20:12.660 align:start position:0%
um in the standard bucket we could
 
03:20:15.349 --> 03:20:15.359 align:start position:0%
adjust all three buckets or we could
 
03:20:19.730 --> 03:20:19.740 align:start position:0%
adjust just one correct but not
 
03:20:21.590 --> 03:20:21.600 align:start position:0%
differently for different institutions
 
03:20:23.330 --> 03:20:23.340 align:start position:0%
based on
 
03:20:26.230 --> 03:20:26.240 align:start position:0%
some pairs payer split or whatever
 
03:20:28.969 --> 03:20:28.979 align:start position:0%
correct the rate is a service base rate
 
03:20:31.969 --> 03:20:31.979 align:start position:0%
so as long as it's the same service it
 
03:20:34.670 --> 03:20:34.680 align:start position:0%
would be the same rate so verification
 
03:20:36.170 --> 03:20:36.180 align:start position:0%
would be if there was an additional
 
03:20:36.180 --> 03:20:37.370 align:start position:0%
would be if there was an additional
service

03:20:37.370 --> 03:20:37.380 align:start position:0%
service
 
03:20:41.389 --> 03:20:41.399 align:start position:0%
a rate differential is allowable thank
 
03:20:41.399 --> 03:20:42.230 align:start position:0%
a rate differential is allowable thank
you

03:20:42.230 --> 03:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
you
 
03:20:44.929 --> 03:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
okay and just to piggyback on what he
 
03:20:47.990 --> 03:20:48.000 align:start position:0%
just said if we were to do exactly that
 
03:20:50.330 --> 03:20:50.340 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note on the original Bill
 
03:20:53.210 --> 03:20:53.220 align:start position:0%
dated 2823
 
03:20:57.530 --> 03:20:57.540 align:start position:0%
is okay it's good for that description
 
03:21:00.710 --> 03:21:00.720 align:start position:0%
if this committee decided to bump
 
03:21:03.769 --> 03:21:03.779 align:start position:0%
everybody's rate up to 115 a day for
 
03:21:06.050 --> 03:21:06.060 align:start position:0%
regardless of the level of service that
 
03:21:09.290 --> 03:21:09.300 align:start position:0%
fiscal note is accurate yes meaning for
 
03:21:11.870 --> 03:21:11.880 align:start position:0%
everyone meaning 48 that that are
 
03:21:14.290 --> 03:21:14.300 align:start position:0%
licensed under Hep they would include he
 
03:21:17.330 --> 03:21:17.340 align:start position:0%
p805 as well and a5s would be more than
 
03:21:19.670 --> 03:21:19.680 align:start position:0%
48 okay great representative Weiler for
 
03:21:23.210 --> 03:21:23.220 align:start position:0%
a question then representative erf
 
03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:21:28.790 --> 03:21:28.800 align:start position:0%
we presume that if we increase Medicaid
 
03:21:32.330 --> 03:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
rates that the federal government which
 
03:21:34.969 --> 03:21:34.979 align:start position:0%
pays 50 percent will match it
 
03:21:39.650 --> 03:21:39.660 align:start position:0%
 
03:21:42.469 --> 03:21:42.479 align:start position:0%
again it has to follow the process so I
 
03:21:43.730 --> 03:21:43.740 align:start position:0%
couldn't speak on behalf of the federal
 
03:21:46.250 --> 03:21:46.260 align:start position:0%
government but the process is standard
 
03:21:49.010 --> 03:21:49.020 align:start position:0%
is first we have to public notice we
 
03:21:51.050 --> 03:21:51.060 align:start position:0%
have to apply for that they have to
 
03:21:54.830 --> 03:21:54.840 align:start position:0%
approve of the methodology and then yes
 
03:21:56.570 --> 03:21:56.580 align:start position:0%
then they would accept there is an
 
03:21:59.690 --> 03:21:59.700 align:start position:0%
opportunity they could say no it's too
 
03:22:02.990 --> 03:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
big an increase that's that's correct do
 
03:22:05.630 --> 03:22:05.640 align:start position:0%
we know what other states get do they do
 
03:22:07.550 --> 03:22:07.560 align:start position:0%
they have different rates than we do yes
 
03:22:09.410 --> 03:22:09.420 align:start position:0%
they do I think I
 
03:22:12.290 --> 03:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
I thought I submitted that last time
 
03:22:14.450 --> 03:22:14.460 align:start position:0%
um so
 
03:22:14.460 --> 03:22:16.910 align:start position:0%
um so
with

03:22:16.910 --> 03:22:16.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
03:22:18.769 --> 03:22:18.779 align:start position:0%
we typically look at
 
03:22:20.990 --> 03:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
um other local
 
03:22:23.330 --> 03:22:23.340 align:start position:0%
States and I've pulled for this and I
 
03:22:26.809 --> 03:22:26.819 align:start position:0%
pulled Massachusetts that 106.76 Rhode
 
03:22:30.230 --> 03:22:30.240 align:start position:0%
Island is at 78 Vermont has three tiers
 
03:22:32.050 --> 03:22:32.060 align:start position:0%
which range from
 
03:22:35.990 --> 03:22:36.000 align:start position:0%
6107 to 84 46.
 
03:22:40.030 --> 03:22:40.040 align:start position:0%
and Connecticut is a
 
03:22:42.110 --> 03:22:42.120 align:start position:0%
facility-based rate so they actually
 
03:22:45.469 --> 03:22:45.479 align:start position:0%
look at every provider's cost report the
 
03:22:48.769 --> 03:22:48.779 align:start position:0%
median is 89.53 in Connecticut the mean
 
03:22:51.590 --> 03:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
is 97.29
 
03:22:53.630 --> 03:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
. so we're lower than almost all the
 
03:22:55.250 --> 03:22:55.260 align:start position:0%
other northeast states that's correct
 
03:22:57.290 --> 03:22:57.300 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:22:59.929 --> 03:22:59.939 align:start position:0%
representative erf
 
03:23:02.030 --> 03:23:02.040 align:start position:0%
so just clarify what you just said did
 
03:23:03.469 --> 03:23:03.479 align:start position:0%
at least one of those states have one
 
03:23:05.030 --> 03:23:05.040 align:start position:0%
rate for all three
 
03:23:08.269 --> 03:23:08.279 align:start position:0%
yes Massachusetts and Rhode Island have
 
03:23:11.809 --> 03:23:11.819 align:start position:0%
the same rate any level of care
 
03:23:15.769 --> 03:23:15.779 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
so do states have different levels of
 
03:23:18.670 --> 03:23:18.680 align:start position:0%
care than the three that we talked about
 
03:23:22.490 --> 03:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
so well they could Define it differently
 
03:23:24.950 --> 03:23:24.960 align:start position:0%
so we are defining it as a dementia
 
03:23:27.290 --> 03:23:27.300 align:start position:0%
level one and a dementia level two so
 
03:23:29.030 --> 03:23:29.040 align:start position:0%
they could have for example we also have
 
03:23:30.769 --> 03:23:30.779 align:start position:0%
the behavioral health of Behavioral
 
03:23:33.170 --> 03:23:33.180 align:start position:0%
Health rate was in an assisted living
 
03:23:33.180 --> 03:23:34.190 align:start position:0%
Health rate was in an assisted living
facility

03:23:34.190 --> 03:23:34.200 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:23:36.650 --> 03:23:36.660 align:start position:0%
then there could be another rate there
 
03:23:39.830 --> 03:23:39.840 align:start position:0%
or so it would depend on how that state
 
03:23:42.590 --> 03:23:42.600 align:start position:0%
defines it
 
03:23:45.469 --> 03:23:45.479 align:start position:0%
so how did we so what about the what's
 
03:23:47.150 --> 03:23:47.160 align:start position:0%
our Behavior Health rate or don't we
 
03:23:51.110 --> 03:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:52.670 --> 03:23:52.680 align:start position:0%
okay so does that come into a different
 
03:23:55.670 --> 03:23:55.680 align:start position:0%
license it's a special contract here's
 
03:23:58.130 --> 03:23:58.140 align:start position:0%
where things get muddy I suppose so that
 
03:23:59.690 --> 03:23:59.700 align:start position:0%
was a special contract when there was a
 
03:24:01.969 --> 03:24:01.979 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health crisis that they moved
 
03:24:03.830 --> 03:24:03.840 align:start position:0%
individuals from New Hampshire hospital
 
03:24:06.349 --> 03:24:06.359 align:start position:0%
into nursing facilities and assisted
 
03:24:08.389 --> 03:24:08.399 align:start position:0%
living facilities I don't know if if
 
03:24:10.370 --> 03:24:10.380 align:start position:0%
everyone was part of that
 
03:24:12.830 --> 03:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
um but it was it was handed to us um
 
03:24:15.650 --> 03:24:15.660 align:start position:0%
there was a rate of 289 12 that was for
 
03:24:17.809 --> 03:24:17.819 align:start position:0%
those few beds and it's a contracted
 
03:24:20.090 --> 03:24:20.100 align:start position:0%
rate it ends in May
 
03:24:21.830 --> 03:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
are there any more rates that we're not
 
03:24:22.969 --> 03:24:22.979 align:start position:0%
aware of
 
03:24:25.250 --> 03:24:25.260 align:start position:0%
um for assisted living yes for
 
03:24:27.229 --> 03:24:27.239 align:start position:0%
residential care there are not any more
 
03:24:29.570 --> 03:24:29.580 align:start position:0%
rates the the three main rates are the
 
03:24:30.950 --> 03:24:30.960 align:start position:0%
rates here
 
03:24:33.889 --> 03:24:33.899 align:start position:0%
the 289-12 behavioral health is a
 
03:24:35.690 --> 03:24:35.700 align:start position:0%
special contracted rate for a temporary
 
03:24:38.269 --> 03:24:38.279 align:start position:0%
time okay so some states have constant
 
03:24:39.889 --> 03:24:39.899 align:start position:0%
rates across the three let's call them
 
03:24:41.750 --> 03:24:41.760 align:start position:0%
standard pseudo standard
 
03:24:43.190 --> 03:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
some states have variable rates like we
 
03:24:44.809 --> 03:24:44.819 align:start position:0%
do does the department have any
 
03:24:46.910 --> 03:24:46.920 align:start position:0%
recommendation as to like why did we
 
03:24:49.070 --> 03:24:49.080 align:start position:0%
choose three separate rates and how what
 
03:24:50.570 --> 03:24:50.580 align:start position:0%
was our methodology for coming up with
 
03:24:52.370 --> 03:24:52.380 align:start position:0%
these ratios
 
03:24:54.469 --> 03:24:54.479 align:start position:0%
so my understanding of the methodology
 
03:24:57.170 --> 03:24:57.180 align:start position:0%
and this predates my time in the
 
03:24:58.910 --> 03:24:58.920 align:start position:0%
department but my understanding of the
 
03:25:01.550 --> 03:25:01.560 align:start position:0%
methodology is again that there was a
 
03:25:04.490 --> 03:25:04.500 align:start position:0%
point in time standard set they did have
 
03:25:04.500 --> 03:25:05.210 align:start position:0%
point in time standard set they did have
um

03:25:05.210 --> 03:25:05.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:06.889 --> 03:25:06.899 align:start position:0%
I believe there was a company that came
 
03:25:09.050 --> 03:25:09.060 align:start position:0%
in to look at and rebasing all of the
 
03:25:12.410 --> 03:25:12.420 align:start position:0%
CFI rates and then at that time that's
 
03:25:14.510 --> 03:25:14.520 align:start position:0%
when the rates were determined as far as
 
03:25:17.570 --> 03:25:17.580 align:start position:0%
the additional levels the 805 facilities
 
03:25:19.309 --> 03:25:19.319 align:start position:0%
I believe are the only ones that qualify
 
03:25:21.050 --> 03:25:21.060 align:start position:0%
for the level one and level two dementia
 
03:25:23.630 --> 03:25:23.640 align:start position:0%
rates because they have another they
 
03:25:27.070 --> 03:25:27.080 align:start position:0%
have added rules with additional medical
 
03:25:29.570 --> 03:25:29.580 align:start position:0%
requirements and that's why they have
 
03:25:31.790 --> 03:25:31.800 align:start position:0%
the two additional dementia level rates
 
03:25:35.269 --> 03:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
that 804 facilities don't have that that
 
03:25:38.030 --> 03:25:38.040 align:start position:0%
rule in additional medical requirement
 
03:25:41.150 --> 03:25:41.160 align:start position:0%
so would the department consider
 
03:25:42.950 --> 03:25:42.960 align:start position:0%
the absolute difference to be
 
03:25:45.050 --> 03:25:45.060 align:start position:0%
appropriate or would they consider the
 
03:25:46.670 --> 03:25:46.680 align:start position:0%
percentage difference to be appropriate
 
03:25:48.650 --> 03:25:48.660 align:start position:0%
if and if the base rate was to be
 
03:25:51.410 --> 03:25:51.420 align:start position:0%
changed and the and the assumption is
 
03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:52.560 align:start position:0%
they're not going to help it won't be
 
03:25:55.190 --> 03:25:55.200 align:start position:0%
constant at that point would they would
 
03:25:57.950 --> 03:25:57.960 align:start position:0%
would it be just a whatever the rate
 
03:25:59.150 --> 03:25:59.160 align:start position:0%
whatever the number is now the
 
03:26:00.650 --> 03:26:00.660 align:start position:0%
difference in dollars just if you just
 
03:26:02.510 --> 03:26:02.520 align:start position:0%
add those is that appropriate to
 
03:26:03.830 --> 03:26:03.840 align:start position:0%
calculate the differences between the
 
03:26:05.690 --> 03:26:05.700 align:start position:0%
levels of service or is it more probably
 
03:26:07.790 --> 03:26:07.800 align:start position:0%
do the percentage-based calculation is
 
03:26:11.150 --> 03:26:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:12.530 --> 03:26:12.540 align:start position:0%
she's not the math guy why are you
 
03:26:14.630 --> 03:26:14.640 align:start position:0%
looking at him yeah but he speaks on
 
03:26:16.010 --> 03:26:16.020 align:start position:0%
behalf of the department I just
 
03:26:17.389 --> 03:26:17.399 align:start position:0%
calculate rates
 
03:26:17.399 --> 03:26:20.450 align:start position:0%
calculate rates
um

03:26:20.450 --> 03:26:20.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:23.030 --> 03:26:23.040 align:start position:0%
well I would if it were me on a personal
 
03:26:25.010 --> 03:26:25.020 align:start position:0%
level I would consider the additional
 
03:26:27.110 --> 03:26:27.120 align:start position:0%
requirement is nursing care and I would
 
03:26:28.729 --> 03:26:28.739 align:start position:0%
not be comfortable having the same rate
 
03:26:30.889 --> 03:26:30.899 align:start position:0%
for all three levels of care but I'm not
 
03:26:32.030 --> 03:26:32.040 align:start position:0%
saying that on behalf of the department
 
03:26:34.450 --> 03:26:34.460 align:start position:0%
no no but that's not even my question
 
03:26:37.250 --> 03:26:37.260 align:start position:0%
but that's not my question I I get that
 
03:26:38.809 --> 03:26:38.819 align:start position:0%
but right now there's a difference
 
03:26:40.790 --> 03:26:40.800 align:start position:0%
between one two and three there's a
 
03:26:42.170 --> 03:26:42.180 align:start position:0%
dollar difference and there's a
 
03:26:43.790 --> 03:26:43.800 align:start position:0%
percentage difference and I'm just
 
03:26:45.110 --> 03:26:45.120 align:start position:0%
trying to understand if we increase the
 
03:26:45.120 --> 03:26:46.010 align:start position:0%
trying to understand if we increase the
base

03:26:46.010 --> 03:26:46.020 align:start position:0%
base
 
03:26:47.809 --> 03:26:47.819 align:start position:0%
but it just makes sense to just keep the
 
03:26:50.150 --> 03:26:50.160 align:start position:0%
same dollar differences forward it makes
 
03:26:51.229 --> 03:26:51.239 align:start position:0%
sense to
 
03:26:52.849 --> 03:26:52.859 align:start position:0%
do percentage differences just in terms
 
03:26:54.050 --> 03:26:54.060 align:start position:0%
of costs I'm assuming that's sort of
 
03:26:54.950 --> 03:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
what you have what you're looking at
 
03:26:56.450 --> 03:26:56.460 align:start position:0%
with these rates
 
03:26:57.590 --> 03:26:57.600 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:26:59.990 --> 03:27:00.000 align:start position:0%
they were they were cost based at one
 
03:27:01.849 --> 03:27:01.859 align:start position:0%
point in time um and the Market Basket
 
03:27:03.410 --> 03:27:03.420 align:start position:0%
inflation factor which I mentioned so
 
03:27:05.750 --> 03:27:05.760 align:start position:0%
that's applied is a cost based inflation
 
03:27:07.969 --> 03:27:07.979 align:start position:0%
Factor Allowed by CMS
 
03:27:08.990 --> 03:27:09.000 align:start position:0%
um I would
 
03:27:10.969 --> 03:27:10.979 align:start position:0%
I would suggest a percentage is probably
 
03:27:10.979 --> 03:27:13.070 align:start position:0%
I would suggest a percentage is probably
adequate

03:27:13.070 --> 03:27:13.080 align:start position:0%
adequate
 
03:27:15.110 --> 03:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
um again that's
 
03:27:17.750 --> 03:27:17.760 align:start position:0%
because those additional levels are
 
03:27:19.849 --> 03:27:19.859 align:start position:0%
nursing care and we all have heard about
 
03:27:22.490 --> 03:27:22.500 align:start position:0%
the many additional costs regarding
 
03:27:24.349 --> 03:27:24.359 align:start position:0%
nursing at the time
 
03:27:26.210 --> 03:27:26.220 align:start position:0%
represent representative hole for a
 
03:27:26.220 --> 03:27:30.410 align:start position:0%
represent representative hole for a
question

03:27:30.410 --> 03:27:30.420 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:32.630 --> 03:27:32.640 align:start position:0%
these questions
 
03:27:35.030 --> 03:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
which of those three is probably the
 
03:27:36.830 --> 03:27:36.840 align:start position:0%
biggest need and would you have a
 
03:27:38.990 --> 03:27:39.000 align:start position:0%
percentage increase that's higher for
 
03:27:42.110 --> 03:27:42.120 align:start position:0%
one particular right you have the option
 
03:27:43.550 --> 03:27:43.560 align:start position:0%
of scaling them by Dollar you have the
 
03:27:45.530 --> 03:27:45.540 align:start position:0%
option on scaling them by percentage you
 
03:27:47.269 --> 03:27:47.279 align:start position:0%
have the option right potentially of
 
03:27:51.710 --> 03:27:51.720 align:start position:0%
scaling them differently based on demand
 
03:27:55.490 --> 03:27:55.500 align:start position:0%
and need for services if that's the case
 
03:28:00.110 --> 03:28:00.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:28:02.690 --> 03:28:02.700 align:start position:0%
so I guess it depends on how you would
 
03:28:06.590 --> 03:28:06.600 align:start position:0%
you know Define what the biggest need is
 
03:28:10.370 --> 03:28:10.380 align:start position:0%
um you know by far the Hep 804s which is
 
03:28:11.929 --> 03:28:11.939 align:start position:0%
the standard assisted living facility
 
03:28:14.570 --> 03:28:14.580 align:start position:0%
have the larger population the two
 
03:28:16.309 --> 03:28:16.319 align:start position:0%
dimensional levels are are smaller
 
03:28:18.229 --> 03:28:18.239 align:start position:0%
populations by a pretty significant
 
03:28:19.670 --> 03:28:19.680 align:start position:0%
number and I gave those numbers earlier
 
03:28:23.690 --> 03:28:23.700 align:start position:0%
uh where nearly 90 actually 89 if you
 
03:28:26.630 --> 03:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
round down I suppose percent of our CFI
 
03:28:30.229 --> 03:28:30.239 align:start position:0%
clients are in the standard residential
 
03:28:33.849 --> 03:28:33.859 align:start position:0%
care where we only have you know
 
03:28:37.849 --> 03:28:37.859 align:start position:0%
1.62 and the dementia level one and
 
03:28:39.710 --> 03:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
seven point two two percent in dementia
 
03:28:42.410 --> 03:28:42.420 align:start position:0%
level two so I don't know if that's
 
03:28:45.349 --> 03:28:45.359 align:start position:0%
getting at what you're looking at uh
 
03:28:49.070 --> 03:28:49.080 align:start position:0%
looking for so I'm looking at secondary
 
03:28:53.090 --> 03:28:53.100 align:start position:0%
factors like vacancies for Staffing
 
03:28:55.910 --> 03:28:55.920 align:start position:0%
positions right some of the other things
 
03:28:58.130 --> 03:28:58.140 align:start position:0%
you're trying to meet right unmet right
 
03:29:01.130 --> 03:29:01.140 align:start position:0%
waiting lists on beds those things are
 
03:29:03.050 --> 03:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
directly impacted by the resources
 
03:29:06.889 --> 03:29:06.899 align:start position:0%
available to hire staff and if you well
 
03:29:08.389 --> 03:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
if you can't find the staff that's a
 
03:29:09.950 --> 03:29:09.960 align:start position:0%
different we can't solve that issue but
 
03:29:13.910 --> 03:29:13.920 align:start position:0%
if you were to change the reimbursement
 
03:29:15.710 --> 03:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
rate you might be able to bring in more
 
03:29:18.229 --> 03:29:18.239 align:start position:0%
staff for a particular need so right
 
03:29:18.239 --> 03:29:20.150 align:start position:0%
staff for a particular need so right
percentage-wise

03:29:20.150 --> 03:29:20.160 align:start position:0%
percentage-wise
 
03:29:22.370 --> 03:29:22.380 align:start position:0%
is the standard care right have the
 
03:29:24.170 --> 03:29:24.180 align:start position:0%
biggest waiting list percentage-wise or
 
03:29:27.349 --> 03:29:27.359 align:start position:0%
is it dementia one two right so I have
 
03:29:29.809 --> 03:29:29.819 align:start position:0%
to bring that back sorry for the uh loud
 
03:29:32.210 --> 03:29:32.220 align:start position:0%
uh I have to bring that back to um the
 
03:29:34.969 --> 03:29:34.979 align:start position:0%
CFI administrator to get a sense there
 
03:29:36.530 --> 03:29:36.540 align:start position:0%
um that was not a question I thought of
 
03:29:38.450 --> 03:29:38.460 align:start position:0%
prior to this but I can certainly look
 
03:29:39.650 --> 03:29:39.660 align:start position:0%
into that for the committee and get back
 
03:29:47.150 --> 03:29:47.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:29:48.769 --> 03:29:48.779 align:start position:0%
up items but I'm sure we'll get those
 
03:29:51.769 --> 03:29:51.779 align:start position:0%
and absolutely thank you very much I see
 
03:29:54.650 --> 03:29:54.660 align:start position:0%
uh Mr Cahoon here and I also see Miss
 
03:29:56.990 --> 03:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
Horrigan here would either of you like
 
03:29:59.929 --> 03:29:59.939 align:start position:0%
to come forward and speak on House Bill
 
03:29:59.939 --> 03:30:02.090 align:start position:0%
to come forward and speak on House Bill
527.

03:30:02.090 --> 03:30:02.100 align:start position:0%
527.
 
03:30:05.389 --> 03:30:05.399 align:start position:0%
okay Mr Cahoon is the highest bidder
 
03:30:10.610 --> 03:30:10.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:13.969 --> 03:30:13.979 align:start position:0%
home I'm here representing uh Hampshire
 
03:30:16.790 --> 03:30:16.800 align:start position:0%
Association of Residential Care Homes
 
03:30:18.650 --> 03:30:18.660 align:start position:0%
um I would have been here representing
 
03:30:20.929 --> 03:30:20.939 align:start position:0%
uh Friendship Manor as well
 
03:30:23.030 --> 03:30:23.040 align:start position:0%
which was the home that my wife and I
 
03:30:25.790 --> 03:30:25.800 align:start position:0%
ran for 37 years
 
03:30:27.830 --> 03:30:27.840 align:start position:0%
um Friendship Manor would really love
 
03:30:29.150 --> 03:30:29.160 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
03:30:32.929 --> 03:30:32.939 align:start position:0%
um because we were an 804 home we were
 
03:30:35.750 --> 03:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
about 90 to 95 percent Medicaid
 
03:30:38.269 --> 03:30:38.279 align:start position:0%
and we close in May because we couldn't
 
03:30:39.769 --> 03:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
hire anyone
 
03:30:39.779 --> 03:30:40.490 align:start position:0%
hire anyone
um

03:30:40.490 --> 03:30:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:40.500 --> 03:30:41.870 align:start position:0%
um
so

03:30:41.870 --> 03:30:41.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:30:45.170 --> 03:30:45.180 align:start position:0%
but that does not necessarily mean that
 
03:30:47.990 --> 03:30:48.000 align:start position:0%
that I think that this bill as it is is
 
03:30:50.269 --> 03:30:50.279 align:start position:0%
the way that we should go forward
 
03:30:52.370 --> 03:30:52.380 align:start position:0%
um the
 
03:30:53.750 --> 03:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
there are a number of things I'd like to
 
03:30:57.110 --> 03:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
say um there was a document distributed
 
03:30:58.670 --> 03:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
last week
 
03:31:01.010 --> 03:31:01.020 align:start position:0%
with the rates of neighboring states
 
03:31:04.010 --> 03:31:04.020 align:start position:0%
the document's not quite complete okay
 
03:31:05.990 --> 03:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
for example Rhode Island is down there
 
03:31:07.969 --> 03:31:07.979 align:start position:0%
as a single rate Rhode Island actually
 
03:31:11.570 --> 03:31:11.580 align:start position:0%
has three rates okay and the three rates
 
03:31:14.030 --> 03:31:14.040 align:start position:0%
and and that's as of
 
03:31:14.040 --> 03:31:15.710 align:start position:0%
and and that's as of
um

03:31:15.710 --> 03:31:15.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:31:19.370 --> 03:31:19.380 align:start position:0%
just about a year ago February of 2022.
 
03:31:21.229 --> 03:31:21.239 align:start position:0%
um the three rates are 78 dollars for
 
03:31:23.330 --> 03:31:23.340 align:start position:0%
what they call Basic care and then they
 
03:31:26.750 --> 03:31:26.760 align:start position:0%
have two enhanced rates one is 113 a day
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
and the other is 136 dollars a day
 
03:31:33.050 --> 03:31:33.060 align:start position:0%
I actually have a couple of copies of
 
03:31:34.969 --> 03:31:34.979 align:start position:0%
that if you'd like them I don't know if
 
03:31:36.229 --> 03:31:36.239 align:start position:0%
you would or not
 
03:31:37.910 --> 03:31:37.920 align:start position:0%
um that would be great if we could and I
 
03:31:39.170 --> 03:31:39.180 align:start position:0%
think representative hole has a question
 
03:31:41.330 --> 03:31:41.340 align:start position:0%
but it's probably related to that you've
 
03:31:42.410 --> 03:31:42.420 align:start position:0%
already answered my question if you
 
03:31:44.710 --> 03:31:44.720 align:start position:0%
could provide those rates in a document
 
03:31:47.210 --> 03:31:47.220 align:start position:0%
all right they from they're from this
 
03:31:49.670 --> 03:31:49.680 align:start position:0%
43-page document from the state of Rhode
 
03:31:52.490 --> 03:31:52.500 align:start position:0%
Island about how it your rates uh an
 
03:31:54.710 --> 03:31:54.720 align:start position:0%
individual's rate but that's page 16
 
03:31:57.469 --> 03:31:57.479 align:start position:0%
from this document
 
03:32:01.130 --> 03:32:01.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:02.510 --> 03:32:02.520 align:start position:0%
um there's nothing down there for the
 
03:32:04.190 --> 03:32:04.200 align:start position:0%
state of Maine now Maine has an
 
03:32:04.200 --> 03:32:05.990 align:start position:0%
state of Maine now Maine has an
extensive

03:32:05.990 --> 03:32:06.000 align:start position:0%
extensive
 
03:32:07.969 --> 03:32:07.979 align:start position:0%
um Residential Care program or Assisted
 
03:32:09.650 --> 03:32:09.660 align:start position:0%
Living Program
 
03:32:09.660 --> 03:32:10.490 align:start position:0%
Living Program
um

03:32:10.490 --> 03:32:10.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:12.469 --> 03:32:12.479 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit more complicated than
 
03:32:15.469 --> 03:32:15.479 align:start position:0%
ours but we are our association uh and
 
03:32:17.570 --> 03:32:17.580 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Healthcare are working on
 
03:32:19.130 --> 03:32:19.140 align:start position:0%
getting the rates from Maine
 
03:32:20.870 --> 03:32:20.880 align:start position:0%
so as soon as we get those we will
 
03:32:23.030 --> 03:32:23.040 align:start position:0%
forward them along to you
 
03:32:23.040 --> 03:32:23.929 align:start position:0%
forward them along to you
um

03:32:23.929 --> 03:32:23.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:25.729 --> 03:32:25.739 align:start position:0%
the other thing I wanted to point out it
 
03:32:27.650 --> 03:32:27.660 align:start position:0%
was on the document that was distributed
 
03:32:29.630 --> 03:32:29.640 align:start position:0%
again last week
 
03:32:34.429 --> 03:32:34.439 align:start position:0%
that includes the rates in other states
 
03:32:37.610 --> 03:32:37.620 align:start position:0%
um it does also include our rates
 
03:32:41.090 --> 03:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
for the basic care dementia 1 and
 
03:32:42.469 --> 03:32:42.479 align:start position:0%
dementia 2.
 
03:32:46.010 --> 03:32:46.020 align:start position:0%
there is really no tie between
 
03:32:49.849 --> 03:32:49.859 align:start position:0%
the rate and the license okay
 
03:32:49.859 --> 03:32:51.110 align:start position:0%
the rate and the license okay
um

03:32:51.110 --> 03:32:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:55.969 --> 03:32:55.979 align:start position:0%
Hep 804s are the bulk of oh I'm not even
 
03:32:58.550 --> 03:32:58.560 align:start position:0%
sure that's true there are a lot of CFI
 
03:33:01.309 --> 03:33:01.319 align:start position:0%
people in Hep 804s but there are a lot
 
03:33:03.590 --> 03:33:03.600 align:start position:0%
of people at the basic rate in Hep 805s
 
03:33:04.729 --> 03:33:04.739 align:start position:0%
as well
 
03:33:07.370 --> 03:33:07.380 align:start position:0%
so the dementia rate is not per se an
 
03:33:09.410 --> 03:33:09.420 align:start position:0%
805 rate
 
03:33:14.269 --> 03:33:14.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:33:16.729 --> 03:33:16.739 align:start position:0%
people who are receiving the dementia
 
03:33:20.210 --> 03:33:20.220 align:start position:0%
rate in 804 homes but not very many
 
03:33:22.309 --> 03:33:22.319 align:start position:0%
how these rates came about the question
 
03:33:25.630 --> 03:33:25.640 align:start position:0%
was asked about 20 years ago the state
 
03:33:28.610 --> 03:33:28.620 align:start position:0%
DHHS undertook a pilot program
 
03:33:31.309 --> 03:33:31.319 align:start position:0%
to Pilot rates for dementia care
 
03:33:33.410 --> 03:33:33.420 align:start position:0%
dementia care was becoming very much of
 
03:33:36.050 --> 03:33:36.060 align:start position:0%
an issue at that time and three homes
 
03:33:38.330 --> 03:33:38.340 align:start position:0%
participated in the in the uh I believe
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
initially in the pilot program
 
03:33:42.469 --> 03:33:42.479 align:start position:0%
only two of those homes are still in
 
03:33:46.729 --> 03:33:46.739 align:start position:0%
business okay uh those two homes are uh
 
03:33:48.290 --> 03:33:48.300 align:start position:0%
the unit Deerfield
 
03:33:51.889 --> 03:33:51.899 align:start position:0%
and pine Rock Manor and Warner
 
03:33:53.630 --> 03:33:53.640 align:start position:0%
um when the
 
03:33:56.330 --> 03:33:56.340 align:start position:0%
on the program ended
 
03:33:58.070 --> 03:33:58.080 align:start position:0%
um I don't know what happened or what
 
03:33:59.929 --> 03:33:59.939 align:start position:0%
how the decision was made but the
 
03:34:01.490 --> 03:34:01.500 align:start position:0%
decision was made not to extend those
 
03:34:03.830 --> 03:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
rates but the people who were in the
 
03:34:05.210 --> 03:34:05.220 align:start position:0%
program were allowed to continue
 
03:34:07.070 --> 03:34:07.080 align:start position:0%
charging those rates
 
03:34:10.670 --> 03:34:10.680 align:start position:0%
so for about 20 years only two for two
 
03:34:12.410 --> 03:34:12.420 align:start position:0%
or three providers were allowed to
 
03:34:14.150 --> 03:34:14.160 align:start position:0%
charge the dementia rate
 
03:34:17.690 --> 03:34:17.700 align:start position:0%
on July 1st of 2021 again there were
 
03:34:19.190 --> 03:34:19.200 align:start position:0%
only two providers they were the unit
 
03:34:21.110 --> 03:34:21.120 align:start position:0%
deer field and
 
03:34:23.570 --> 03:34:23.580 align:start position:0%
um the uh
 
03:34:25.610 --> 03:34:25.620 align:start position:0%
Pine Rock manner
 
03:34:28.670 --> 03:34:28.680 align:start position:0%
as of July 1st 2022 there are 12
 
03:34:28.680 --> 03:34:30.290 align:start position:0%
as of July 1st 2022 there are 12
providers

03:34:30.290 --> 03:34:30.300 align:start position:0%
providers
 
03:34:32.870 --> 03:34:32.880 align:start position:0%
so at that some time in the last year
 
03:34:33.950 --> 03:34:33.960 align:start position:0%
and a half
 
03:34:36.110 --> 03:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
the state decided
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure why but the state decided I
 
03:34:40.190 --> 03:34:40.200 align:start position:0%
know that Wendy Altman who was here this
 
03:34:42.110 --> 03:34:42.120 align:start position:0%
morning was some somewhat behind that
 
03:34:44.389 --> 03:34:44.399 align:start position:0%
because you thought that made sense uh
 
03:34:47.290 --> 03:34:47.300 align:start position:0%
to ex to expand that
 
03:34:50.450 --> 03:34:50.460 align:start position:0%
availability of the dementia rates and
 
03:34:52.010 --> 03:34:52.020 align:start position:0%
so that was done in the last year and a
 
03:34:55.130 --> 03:34:55.140 align:start position:0%
half I know that there are actually at
 
03:34:56.389 --> 03:34:56.399 align:start position:0%
least a couple of others that have been
 
03:34:59.269 --> 03:34:59.279 align:start position:0%
added since July 1st of 2022 so now it's
 
03:35:00.469 --> 03:35:00.479 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit north of 12
 
03:35:00.479 --> 03:35:02.210 align:start position:0%
probably a little bit north of 12
facilities

03:35:02.210 --> 03:35:02.220 align:start position:0%
facilities
 
03:35:02.220 --> 03:35:05.090 align:start position:0%
facilities
um

03:35:05.090 --> 03:35:05.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:07.849 --> 03:35:07.859 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
03:35:07.859 --> 03:35:09.410 align:start position:0%
yeah so
um

03:35:09.410 --> 03:35:09.420 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:12.349 --> 03:35:12.359 align:start position:0%
I I yeah I guess basically that's what I
 
03:35:15.170 --> 03:35:15.180 align:start position:0%
have to say uh the
 
03:35:18.229 --> 03:35:18.239 align:start position:0%
I I think the concept of 527 is pretty
 
03:35:21.110 --> 03:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
flawed uh I think that people need to
 
03:35:23.570 --> 03:35:23.580 align:start position:0%
look at the rates across the board
 
03:35:26.030 --> 03:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
we probably need to make more use of the
 
03:35:27.830 --> 03:35:27.840 align:start position:0%
dementia rate
 
03:35:27.840 --> 03:35:28.610 align:start position:0%
dementia rate
um

03:35:28.610 --> 03:35:28.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:28.620 --> 03:35:30.469 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:35:30.469 --> 03:35:30.479 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:35:33.650 --> 03:35:33.660 align:start position:0%
as an industry CFI ResCare needs more
 
03:35:35.630 --> 03:35:35.640 align:start position:0%
than a 3.1 percent
 
03:35:39.830 --> 03:35:39.840 align:start position:0%
because it is a disappearing industry
 
03:35:39.840 --> 03:35:41.750 align:start position:0%
because it is a disappearing industry
um

03:35:41.750 --> 03:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:35:43.849 --> 03:35:43.859 align:start position:0%
of the
 
03:35:43.859 --> 03:35:45.290 align:start position:0%
of the
uh

03:35:45.290 --> 03:35:45.300 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:35:48.170 --> 03:35:48.180 align:start position:0%
I have another document here excuse me
 
03:35:48.180 --> 03:35:52.070 align:start position:0%
I have another document here excuse me
um

03:35:52.070 --> 03:35:52.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:58.070 --> 03:35:58.080 align:start position:0%
yeah on July 1st 2022 there were 554 CFI
 
03:36:00.800 --> 03:36:00.810 align:start position:0%
ResCare clients in beds
 
03:36:00.810 --> 03:36:02.150 align:start position:0%
ResCare clients in beds
[Music]

03:36:02.150 --> 03:36:02.160 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
03:36:05.690 --> 03:36:05.700 align:start position:0%
and only 49 of those were receiving the
 
03:36:05.700 --> 03:36:06.830 align:start position:0%
and only 49 of those were receiving the
um

03:36:06.830 --> 03:36:06.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
the either dementia one or dementia 2
 
03:36:09.479 --> 03:36:10.429 align:start position:0%
the either dementia one or dementia 2
rates

03:36:10.429 --> 03:36:10.439 align:start position:0%
rates
 
03:36:13.250 --> 03:36:13.260 align:start position:0%
so that's roughly nine percent are
 
03:36:14.929 --> 03:36:14.939 align:start position:0%
receiving that rate
 
03:36:17.090 --> 03:36:17.100 align:start position:0%
so even though more providers are now
 
03:36:19.250 --> 03:36:19.260 align:start position:0%
signing up for this so the access is
 
03:36:21.530 --> 03:36:21.540 align:start position:0%
still extremely Limited
 
03:36:24.410 --> 03:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
um and
 
03:36:27.490 --> 03:36:27.500 align:start position:0%
you know if something isn't done
 
03:36:30.710 --> 03:36:30.720 align:start position:0%
uh there's a genuine General decline in
 
03:36:33.889 --> 03:36:33.899 align:start position:0%
the number of CFI ResCare clients so
 
03:36:36.290 --> 03:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
something isn't done that will disappear
 
03:36:38.450 --> 03:36:38.460 align:start position:0%
as an option and it really takes a
 
03:36:39.830 --> 03:36:39.840 align:start position:0%
structural change
 
03:36:41.870 --> 03:36:41.880 align:start position:0%
which is why our association has asked
 
03:36:45.469 --> 03:36:45.479 align:start position:0%
for an 80 a day basic rate what what is
 
03:36:47.030 --> 03:36:47.040 align:start position:0%
done with the dementia rates we haven't
 
03:36:48.530 --> 03:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
actually gotten into but they should
 
03:36:50.389 --> 03:36:50.399 align:start position:0%
probably be maintained and increased a
 
03:36:52.790 --> 03:36:52.800 align:start position:0%
bit as to how we came to those dementia
 
03:36:55.910 --> 03:36:55.920 align:start position:0%
rates I believe the it's simply been a
 
03:36:58.729 --> 03:36:58.739 align:start position:0%
percentage increase over 20 years that
 
03:37:00.769 --> 03:37:00.779 align:start position:0%
was not really a study done in any
 
03:37:03.050 --> 03:37:03.060 align:start position:0%
recent time to decide this is an
 
03:37:06.349 --> 03:37:06.359 align:start position:0%
appropriate dementia rate so
 
03:37:08.570 --> 03:37:08.580 align:start position:0%
it's just you know three percent a year
 
03:37:10.309 --> 03:37:10.319 align:start position:0%
or whatever it was
 
03:37:12.469 --> 03:37:12.479 align:start position:0%
thank you representative erf for a
 
03:37:14.929 --> 03:37:14.939 align:start position:0%
question so I think you kind of hinted
 
03:37:17.030 --> 03:37:17.040 align:start position:0%
at that when you said this isn't the
 
03:37:18.710 --> 03:37:18.720 align:start position:0%
right vehicle
 
03:37:20.450 --> 03:37:20.460 align:start position:0%
so we've been talking about rates
 
03:37:23.690 --> 03:37:23.700 align:start position:0%
relative to other states specific to
 
03:37:26.630 --> 03:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
this right but now look more broadly at
 
03:37:28.670 --> 03:37:28.680 align:start position:0%
all rates
 
03:37:31.610 --> 03:37:31.620 align:start position:0%
in terms of ratios between states is it
 
03:37:33.410 --> 03:37:33.420 align:start position:0%
gen so let's talk about tech Rhode
 
03:37:35.530 --> 03:37:35.540 align:start position:0%
Island there's we're higher than ours
 
03:37:38.030 --> 03:37:38.040 align:start position:0%
are there rates across the board
 
03:37:40.550 --> 03:37:40.560 align:start position:0%
generally higher than ours or is this
 
03:37:42.710 --> 03:37:42.720 align:start position:0%
okay so it's not just that we're low
 
03:37:44.990 --> 03:37:45.000 align:start position:0%
here relative to Rhode Island we're
 
03:37:47.210 --> 03:37:47.220 align:start position:0%
probably proportional to Rhode Island by
 
03:37:49.790 --> 03:37:49.800 align:start position:0%
some Factor
 
03:37:52.429 --> 03:37:52.439 align:start position:0%
approximately yes okay I'm not familiar
 
03:37:54.110 --> 03:37:54.120 align:start position:0%
certainly with all the rates okay well
 
03:37:56.450 --> 03:37:56.460 align:start position:0%
of course there are a lot of rates I bet
 
03:37:58.309 --> 03:37:58.319 align:start position:0%
you're generalizing but yeah I believe
 
03:37:59.990 --> 03:38:00.000 align:start position:0%
our nursing home rates in general are
 
03:38:01.550 --> 03:38:01.560 align:start position:0%
lower than the other New England states
 
03:38:06.290 --> 03:38:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:09.530 --> 03:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much Mr Cahoon
 
03:38:11.510 --> 03:38:11.520 align:start position:0%
appreciate your input and all the work
 
03:38:14.269 --> 03:38:14.279 align:start position:0%
you've done at friendship manner is that
 
03:38:15.650 --> 03:38:15.660 align:start position:0%
what it's called friendship matter
 
03:38:18.530 --> 03:38:18.540 align:start position:0%
friendship manner
 
03:38:26.210 --> 03:38:26.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:38:28.670 --> 03:38:28.680 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair Kate Horgan uh
 
03:38:30.349 --> 03:38:30.359 align:start position:0%
with the New Hampshire Association of
 
03:38:32.630 --> 03:38:32.640 align:start position:0%
counties I would agree with Mr Calhoun
 
03:38:35.510 --> 03:38:35.520 align:start position:0%
we probably need rate increases across
 
03:38:38.450 --> 03:38:38.460 align:start position:0%
the board as you all know as members of
 
03:38:40.190 --> 03:38:40.200 align:start position:0%
your delegation
 
03:38:42.349 --> 03:38:42.359 align:start position:0%
County nursing homes and the Health Care
 
03:38:45.229 --> 03:38:45.239 align:start position:0%
system in general are in crisis
 
03:38:47.450 --> 03:38:47.460 align:start position:0%
Hillsborough County for example has over
 
03:38:49.610 --> 03:38:49.620 align:start position:0%
a hundred nurses vacancies in their
 
03:38:51.950 --> 03:38:51.960 align:start position:0%
facility counties are closing beds
 
03:38:54.710 --> 03:38:54.720 align:start position:0%
because we can't afford to get people to
 
03:38:57.410 --> 03:38:57.420 align:start position:0%
fill those positions rate increases need
 
03:38:59.690 --> 03:38:59.700 align:start position:0%
to happen across the board uh I'm happy
 
03:39:01.969 --> 03:39:01.979 align:start position:0%
to take any questions but that our
 
03:39:03.650 --> 03:39:03.660 align:start position:0%
position has not changed with the
 
03:39:03.660 --> 03:39:05.929 align:start position:0%
position has not changed with the
amendment

03:39:05.929 --> 03:39:05.939 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
03:39:08.510 --> 03:39:08.520 align:start position:0%
representative erf for a question
 
03:39:11.210 --> 03:39:11.220 align:start position:0%
so how would you increase rates across
 
03:39:13.429 --> 03:39:13.439 align:start position:0%
the board I have an answer for you
 
03:39:17.929 --> 03:39:17.939 align:start position:0%
representative uh so we uh with a bunch
 
03:39:19.670 --> 03:39:19.680 align:start position:0%
of stakeholders have been working with
 
03:39:22.510 --> 03:39:22.520 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald on what
 
03:39:25.729 --> 03:39:25.739 align:start position:0%
effective use of rates increases would
 
03:39:28.370 --> 03:39:28.380 align:start position:0%
be without
 
03:39:31.250 --> 03:39:31.260 align:start position:0%
using a making it a impossible number
 
03:39:34.309 --> 03:39:34.319 align:start position:0%
for us to get I will say the work we've
 
03:39:35.690 --> 03:39:35.700 align:start position:0%
done at the nursing home level would
 
03:39:38.929 --> 03:39:38.939 align:start position:0%
require a 15 increase
 
03:39:41.630 --> 03:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
those numbers are going to be in Senate
 
03:39:43.190 --> 03:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
Bill 86
 
03:39:48.070 --> 03:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
um and it will cover all of the rates in
 
03:39:51.469 --> 03:39:51.479 align:start position:0%
covered under Medicaid
 
03:39:53.809 --> 03:39:53.819 align:start position:0%
including DD as well
 
03:39:55.309 --> 03:39:55.319 align:start position:0%
I knew you'd have a good answer thank
 
03:39:55.319 --> 03:39:57.950 align:start position:0%
I knew you'd have a good answer thank
you

03:39:57.950 --> 03:39:57.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:59.630 --> 03:39:59.640 align:start position:0%
representative tulerski for a question
 
03:40:01.790 --> 03:40:01.800 align:start position:0%
thank you I just want to clarify Senate
 
03:40:04.429 --> 03:40:04.439 align:start position:0%
Bill 86 is that a 15 increase across all
 
03:40:06.950 --> 03:40:06.960 align:start position:0%
of the licenses that is just for nursing
 
03:40:09.290 --> 03:40:09.300 align:start position:0%
homes just for nursing that's okay thank
 
03:40:09.300 --> 03:40:11.690 align:start position:0%
homes just for nursing that's okay thank
you

03:40:11.690 --> 03:40:11.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:13.309 --> 03:40:13.319 align:start position:0%
representative Stringham for a question
 
03:40:15.530 --> 03:40:15.540 align:start position:0%
did you have a recommendation for the
 
03:40:18.830 --> 03:40:18.840 align:start position:0%
facilities that are under this bill uh I
 
03:40:20.750 --> 03:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
am sure it is included in that list but
 
03:40:22.370 --> 03:40:22.380 align:start position:0%
I don't remember what the number is off
 
03:40:23.570 --> 03:40:23.580 align:start position:0%
the top of my head representative
 
03:40:25.490 --> 03:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
Stringham but I could look that up
 
03:40:26.870 --> 03:40:26.880 align:start position:0%
quickly and get it to you before I leave
 
03:40:29.630 --> 03:40:29.640 align:start position:0%
today thank you
 
03:40:32.929 --> 03:40:32.939 align:start position:0%
okay real good all set thank you thank
 
03:40:34.250 --> 03:40:34.260 align:start position:0%
you for your input I know you did send
 
03:40:36.349 --> 03:40:36.359 align:start position:0%
us information when this bill was first
 
03:40:40.070 --> 03:40:40.080 align:start position:0%
in a work session yes uh the committee
 
03:40:43.309 --> 03:40:43.319 align:start position:0%
had asked me how many uh assisted living
 
03:40:46.490 --> 03:40:46.500 align:start position:0%
facility beds The Three Counties who
 
03:40:49.370 --> 03:40:49.380 align:start position:0%
provide assisted living facilities uh
 
03:40:52.269 --> 03:40:52.279 align:start position:0%
have and it's under 50 beds for
 
03:40:56.570 --> 03:40:56.580 align:start position:0%
Rockingham Cheshire and Merrimack but
 
03:40:58.670 --> 03:40:58.680 align:start position:0%
those beds have never been filled more
 
03:41:02.450 --> 03:41:02.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:04.610 --> 03:41:04.620 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
 
03:41:04.620 --> 03:41:08.210 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you
Mr

03:41:08.210 --> 03:41:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:10.550 --> 03:41:10.560 align:start position:0%
Oh by all means
 
03:41:13.130 --> 03:41:13.140 align:start position:0%
just be sure to speak clearly to the mic
 
03:41:15.530 --> 03:41:15.540 align:start position:0%
as we have an audience on YouTube for
 
03:41:17.330 --> 03:41:17.340 align:start position:0%
all posterity okay
 
03:41:18.830 --> 03:41:18.840 align:start position:0%
there was a question about the waiting
 
03:41:21.050 --> 03:41:21.060 align:start position:0%
list and and uh attorney Barry said that
 
03:41:22.429 --> 03:41:22.439 align:start position:0%
he would look into it and see if he
 
03:41:24.010 --> 03:41:24.020 align:start position:0%
could get back to you with those numbers
 
03:41:26.210 --> 03:41:26.220 align:start position:0%
I am going to predict that he won't be
 
03:41:28.550 --> 03:41:28.560 align:start position:0%
able to I'm sorry not because he's not
 
03:41:31.190 --> 03:41:31.200 align:start position:0%
competent because he certainly is but
 
03:41:33.050 --> 03:41:33.060 align:start position:0%
but because those numbers certainly
 
03:41:35.750 --> 03:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
aren't simply aren't kept uh as I
 
03:41:38.870 --> 03:41:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:40.670 --> 03:41:40.680 align:start position:0%
the department tracks these things
 
03:41:43.070 --> 03:41:43.080 align:start position:0%
through authorizations Residential Care
 
03:41:46.190 --> 03:41:46.200 align:start position:0%
beds and CFI are not authorized until
 
03:41:49.910 --> 03:41:49.920 align:start position:0%
the case manager involved finds a bed
 
03:41:53.210 --> 03:41:53.220 align:start position:0%
so and I confirmed all this within the
 
03:41:55.809 --> 03:41:55.819 align:start position:0%
last week or two with uh staff from beas
 
03:41:58.370 --> 03:41:58.380 align:start position:0%
they cannot tell you what the unmet need
 
03:42:01.010 --> 03:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
is okay they know that it's substantial
 
03:42:02.630 --> 03:42:02.640 align:start position:0%
but they haven't got statistics that
 
03:42:04.729 --> 03:42:04.739 align:start position:0%
will reflect it
 
03:42:07.190 --> 03:42:07.200 align:start position:0%
thank you okay representative Stringham
 
03:42:08.929 --> 03:42:08.939 align:start position:0%
for a question Mr Cahoon if you're uh
 
03:42:10.729 --> 03:42:10.739 align:start position:0%
just a quick interested in taking them
 
03:42:13.190 --> 03:42:13.200 align:start position:0%
and then representative hole do you
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
think it would be an an improvement to a
 
03:42:17.750 --> 03:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
system to a first first approve somebody
 
03:42:21.410 --> 03:42:21.420 align:start position:0%
for for eligibility for a facility
 
03:42:23.570 --> 03:42:23.580 align:start position:0%
before you try to match them with a
 
03:42:25.910 --> 03:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
place and is that something that could
 
03:42:27.050 --> 03:42:27.060 align:start position:0%
be done
 
03:42:30.229 --> 03:42:30.239 align:start position:0%
the way the way it works um
 
03:42:32.570 --> 03:42:32.580 align:start position:0%
there's an application process for the
 
03:42:35.030 --> 03:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
authorization okay and on the
 
03:42:37.130 --> 03:42:37.140 align:start position:0%
application process it's divided into
 
03:42:39.290 --> 03:42:39.300 align:start position:0%
two sections one is for home care and
 
03:42:41.809 --> 03:42:41.819 align:start position:0%
the other is for residential care
 
03:42:41.819 --> 03:42:42.889 align:start position:0%
the other is for residential care
um

03:42:42.889 --> 03:42:42.899 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:42.899 --> 03:42:44.750 align:start position:0%
um
and

03:42:44.750 --> 03:42:44.760 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:42:48.349 --> 03:42:48.359 align:start position:0%
the case manager as I understand it uses
 
03:42:50.389 --> 03:42:50.399 align:start position:0%
this document and if there are home care
 
03:42:51.769 --> 03:42:51.779 align:start position:0%
services that they're seeking
 
03:42:53.870 --> 03:42:53.880 align:start position:0%
authorization for but there are no
 
03:42:56.269 --> 03:42:56.279 align:start position:0%
providers available there's a box that
 
03:42:57.769 --> 03:42:57.779 align:start position:0%
they can check that says no providers
 
03:42:57.779 --> 03:42:58.729 align:start position:0%
they can check that says no providers
available

03:42:58.729 --> 03:42:58.739 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:43:00.469 --> 03:43:00.479 align:start position:0%
for residential care there's the same
 
03:43:01.910 --> 03:43:01.920 align:start position:0%
thing there's a box that they can check
 
03:43:03.950 --> 03:43:03.960 align:start position:0%
that says no providers available
 
03:43:05.630 --> 03:43:05.640 align:start position:0%
but they don't make the initial
 
03:43:08.269 --> 03:43:08.279 align:start position:0%
application for residential care because
 
03:43:10.250 --> 03:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
if they do then they're not eligible for
 
03:43:11.210 --> 03:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
Home Care
 
03:43:14.269 --> 03:43:14.279 align:start position:0%
so if they can't find a bed the person
 
03:43:16.250 --> 03:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
is without Services altogether
 
03:43:19.010 --> 03:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
so typically they make the application
 
03:43:21.950 --> 03:43:21.960 align:start position:0%
initially for home and health Home Care
 
03:43:24.769 --> 03:43:24.779 align:start position:0%
Home Services and when a bed is found
 
03:43:26.750 --> 03:43:26.760 align:start position:0%
they transfer the eligibility to
 
03:43:28.429 --> 03:43:28.439 align:start position:0%
Residential Care
 
03:43:28.439 --> 03:43:29.630 align:start position:0%
Residential Care
okay

03:43:29.630 --> 03:43:29.640 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:43:31.610 --> 03:43:31.620 align:start position:0%
representative hole
 
03:43:33.590 --> 03:43:33.600 align:start position:0%
to your point that the data is not
 
03:43:33.600 --> 03:43:34.849 align:start position:0%
to your point that the data is not
collected

03:43:34.849 --> 03:43:34.859 align:start position:0%
collected
 
03:43:39.849 --> 03:43:39.859 align:start position:0%
can you foresee a way that the those
 
03:43:42.950 --> 03:43:42.960 align:start position:0%
patients are those individuals seeking
 
03:43:42.960 --> 03:43:44.210 align:start position:0%
patients are those individuals seeking
care

03:43:44.210 --> 03:43:44.220 align:start position:0%
care
 
03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
somehow are tracked at least in a I made
 
03:43:49.070 --> 03:43:49.080 align:start position:0%
the request but I don't
 
03:43:50.990 --> 03:43:51.000 align:start position:0%
it hasn't opened a case so we'd at least
 
03:43:52.729 --> 03:43:52.739 align:start position:0%
have that information available the
 
03:43:54.769 --> 03:43:54.779 align:start position:0%
people I talked to two weeks ago um
 
03:43:56.570 --> 03:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
they'll remain nameless here for the
 
03:43:58.130 --> 03:43:58.140 align:start position:0%
sake of the guilty
 
03:44:01.610 --> 03:44:01.620 align:start position:0%
um well uh I said they would they would
 
03:44:03.170 --> 03:44:03.180 align:start position:0%
consider that she said yeah that we need
 
03:44:04.849 --> 03:44:04.859 align:start position:0%
to do something here to track these and
 
03:44:06.410 --> 03:44:06.420 align:start position:0%
I'm not exactly sure how they would do
 
03:44:08.389 --> 03:44:08.399 align:start position:0%
it again I can give you all kinds of
 
03:44:10.370 --> 03:44:10.380 align:start position:0%
anecdotal evidence one of the ladies who
 
03:44:13.010 --> 03:44:13.020 align:start position:0%
was here this morning is the uh is the
 
03:44:15.050 --> 03:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
owner of a case management service
 
03:44:17.269 --> 03:44:17.279 align:start position:0%
and she told me last week that she has
 
03:44:19.250 --> 03:44:19.260 align:start position:0%
four clients who have been waiting for a
 
03:44:22.250 --> 03:44:22.260 align:start position:0%
residential care bed for over a year
 
03:44:22.260 --> 03:44:24.349 align:start position:0%
residential care bed for over a year
okay

03:44:24.349 --> 03:44:24.359 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:44:26.570 --> 03:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative ER
 
03:44:27.950 --> 03:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
I just want to understand that statement
 
03:44:30.290 --> 03:44:30.300 align:start position:0%
you made about
 
03:44:33.410 --> 03:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
you're waiting for Home Care
 
03:44:35.750 --> 03:44:35.760 align:start position:0%
until you get home care
 
03:44:37.190 --> 03:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
like they don't count that once you get
 
03:44:39.950 --> 03:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
that but then they immediately apply for
 
03:44:41.330 --> 03:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
residential care and then they counted
 
03:44:42.830 --> 03:44:42.840 align:start position:0%
that you're waiting for residential care
 
03:44:44.870 --> 03:44:44.880 align:start position:0%
no because they if they make the
 
03:44:46.370 --> 03:44:46.380 align:start position:0%
application for eligibility for
 
03:44:48.229 --> 03:44:48.239 align:start position:0%
residential care they're ineligible for
 
03:44:51.650 --> 03:44:51.660 align:start position:0%
home care so I I I get that so so they
 
03:44:53.690 --> 03:44:53.700 align:start position:0%
apply for home care right right and then
 
03:44:55.429 --> 03:44:55.439 align:start position:0%
now they just not really waiting because
 
03:44:56.690 --> 03:44:56.700 align:start position:0%
they don't count it as waiting until
 
03:44:58.729 --> 03:44:58.739 align:start position:0%
they actually get a home care what
 
03:45:00.650 --> 03:45:00.660 align:start position:0%
typically happens is if the case manager
 
03:45:01.969 --> 03:45:01.979 align:start position:0%
believes this client really needs
 
03:45:04.250 --> 03:45:04.260 align:start position:0%
Residential Care they continue to look
 
03:45:06.530 --> 03:45:06.540 align:start position:0%
for a residential care bed and when they
 
03:45:08.690 --> 03:45:08.700 align:start position:0%
find the Residential Care bid and that
 
03:45:10.190 --> 03:45:10.200 align:start position:0%
person is accepted they change the
 
03:45:11.570 --> 03:45:11.580 align:start position:0%
eligibility status
 
03:45:13.670 --> 03:45:13.680 align:start position:0%
the eligibility status is not usually
 
03:45:15.469 --> 03:45:15.479 align:start position:0%
changed until the day that they actually
 
03:45:17.990 --> 03:45:18.000 align:start position:0%
move into residential care because if
 
03:45:19.190 --> 03:45:19.200 align:start position:0%
they changed it sooner they wouldn't be
 
03:45:20.510 --> 03:45:20.520 align:start position:0%
paid for any Services they were
 
03:45:22.190 --> 03:45:22.200 align:start position:0%
receiving at home okay so the
 
03:45:24.410 --> 03:45:24.420 align:start position:0%
eligibility status is suffered from the
 
03:45:28.010 --> 03:45:28.020 align:start position:0%
application yes okay thank you
 
03:45:30.830 --> 03:45:30.840 align:start position:0%
okay a lot of information any further
 
03:45:32.870 --> 03:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
thoughts from Mr Cahoon okay thank you
 
03:45:35.269 --> 03:45:35.279 align:start position:0%
anyone else in the audience interested
 
03:45:37.429 --> 03:45:37.439 align:start position:0%
in talking on House Bill 527 at this
 
03:45:37.439 --> 03:45:38.269 align:start position:0%
in talking on House Bill 527 at this
point

03:45:38.269 --> 03:45:38.279 align:start position:0%
point
 
03:45:41.929 --> 03:45:41.939 align:start position:0%
okay representative walner could I just
 
03:45:45.170 --> 03:45:45.180 align:start position:0%
ask um you spoke about Senate bill
 
03:45:47.690 --> 03:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
um 86 so I just pulled it up my phone I
 
03:45:49.370 --> 03:45:49.380 align:start position:0%
can barely read it but
 
03:45:53.150 --> 03:45:53.160 align:start position:0%
it doesn't does it really ever talk
 
03:45:56.150 --> 03:45:56.160 align:start position:0%
about a rate of
 
03:45:56.160 --> 03:45:57.769 align:start position:0%
about a rate of
increase

03:45:57.769 --> 03:45:57.779 align:start position:0%
increase
 
03:46:00.349 --> 03:46:00.359 align:start position:0%
um it seems like it appropriates a large
 
03:46:03.290 --> 03:46:03.300 align:start position:0%
sum of money and then it leaves it to
 
03:46:06.290 --> 03:46:06.300 align:start position:0%
the commissioner and yes so uh there
 
03:46:07.910 --> 03:46:07.920 align:start position:0%
will be an amendment coming to that bill
 
03:46:10.490 --> 03:46:10.500 align:start position:0%
representative Walnut that will lay out
 
03:46:12.650 --> 03:46:12.660 align:start position:0%
what the rates would be and I just did
 
03:46:14.330 --> 03:46:14.340 align:start position:0%
quickly look it up it would be eighty
 
03:46:16.130 --> 03:46:16.140 align:start position:0%
dollars a day for mid-level care for
 
03:46:17.929 --> 03:46:17.939 align:start position:0%
these facilities is what we would be
 
03:46:20.090 --> 03:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
recommending right is the amendment
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
available now not yet we are
 
03:46:26.210 --> 03:46:26.220 align:start position:0%
finalizing the uh some of the figures
 
03:46:28.610 --> 03:46:28.620 align:start position:0%
because not as you might imagine this is
 
03:46:30.410 --> 03:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
a very large group of stakeholders and
 
03:46:31.729 --> 03:46:31.739 align:start position:0%
not everyone has completed their
 
03:46:33.650 --> 03:46:33.660 align:start position:0%
calculations yet
 
03:46:35.750 --> 03:46:35.760 align:start position:0%
um so we are waiting for those to be
 
03:46:37.309 --> 03:46:37.319 align:start position:0%
finished before we share them with
 
03:46:38.750 --> 03:46:38.760 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald
 
03:46:41.809 --> 03:46:41.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:46:44.690 --> 03:46:44.700 align:start position:0%
okay oh representative hold please as a
 
03:46:46.790 --> 03:46:46.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up to representative walner when
 
03:46:49.250 --> 03:46:49.260 align:start position:0%
said version is available even if it's
 
03:46:51.110 --> 03:46:51.120 align:start position:0%
not formal can you provide to the
 
03:46:52.550 --> 03:46:52.560 align:start position:0%
community yes we'd be happy to share it
 
03:46:55.370 --> 03:46:55.380 align:start position:0%
with the committee when it's finalized
 
03:46:57.650 --> 03:46:57.660 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much thank you
 
03:46:59.570 --> 03:46:59.580 align:start position:0%
um okay a lot to consider here obviously
 
03:47:01.969 --> 03:47:01.979 align:start position:0%
more information has been relayed to us
 
03:47:03.410 --> 03:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
in this work session which was very
 
03:47:05.809 --> 03:47:05.819 align:start position:0%
helpful and productive thank you all uh
 
03:47:07.969 --> 03:47:07.979 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards has asked Mr
 
03:47:10.849 --> 03:47:10.859 align:start position:0%
Ripple to schedule an exec session for
 
03:47:13.010 --> 03:47:13.020 align:start position:0%
the four bills we heard yesterday so
 
03:47:17.950 --> 03:47:17.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:21.889 --> 03:47:21.899 align:start position:0%
282 614 I'm going to ask that he also
 
03:47:26.269 --> 03:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
include this bill in that exec session
 
03:47:30.170 --> 03:47:30.180 align:start position:0%
for a five Bill total for us to consider
 
03:47:33.170 --> 03:47:33.180 align:start position:0%
what's been relayed to us today and look
 
03:47:35.090 --> 03:47:35.100 align:start position:0%
further into the Senate bill
 
03:47:37.190 --> 03:47:37.200 align:start position:0%
sure so I think Monday afternoon might
 
03:47:39.590 --> 03:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
be a good day to schedule those and I
 
03:47:41.150 --> 03:47:41.160 align:start position:0%
think as you mentioned earlier this is a
 
03:47:43.070 --> 03:47:43.080 align:start position:0%
first committee bill so the deadline is
 
03:47:44.570 --> 03:47:44.580 align:start position:0%
tighter on this one than the other four
 
03:47:46.190 --> 03:47:46.200 align:start position:0%
because it has to be voted out of
 
03:47:49.550 --> 03:47:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:47:52.729 --> 03:47:52.739 align:start position:0%
right some have a deadline of March 16th
 
03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
and this is one good to know okay
 
03:47:57.769 --> 03:47:57.779 align:start position:0%
representative walner I I just want do
 
03:47:58.849 --> 03:47:58.859 align:start position:0%
we know what we're doing on Monday
 
03:47:58.859 --> 03:48:02.210 align:start position:0%
we know what we're doing on Monday
morning

03:48:02.210 --> 03:48:02.220 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:04.370 --> 03:48:04.380 align:start position:0%
yes I have everything starting next
 
03:48:06.410 --> 03:48:06.420 align:start position:0%
Monday scheduled as generic budget work
 
03:48:08.690 --> 03:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
sessions there are no more scheduled
 
03:48:10.309 --> 03:48:10.319 align:start position:0%
presentations from the department but I
 
03:48:11.750 --> 03:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
assume you'll begin making decisions
 
03:48:19.370 --> 03:48:19.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:20.750 --> 03:48:20.760 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
03:48:24.349 --> 03:48:24.359 align:start position:0%
um I believe it was Janet who sent us a
 
03:48:28.490 --> 03:48:28.500 align:start position:0%
calendar uh format and on that it says
 
03:48:31.250 --> 03:48:31.260 align:start position:0%
March 13th for 10 o'clock budget work
 
03:48:32.389 --> 03:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
session right that's the one
 
03:48:35.330 --> 03:48:35.340 align:start position:0%
representative yeah
 
03:48:38.750 --> 03:48:38.760 align:start position:0%
okay anything further on House Bill 527
 
03:48:40.190 --> 03:48:40.200 align:start position:0%
or for the good of the order at this
 
03:48:41.870 --> 03:48:41.880 align:start position:0%
point okay I'm going to close the work
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
session on 527 and that'll be it for
 
03:49:04.130 --> 03:49:04.140 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:04.140 --> 03:49:11.510 align:start position:0%
 
right

03:49:11.510 --> 03:49:11.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:49:11.520 --> 03:49:28.010 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

03:49:28.010 --> 03:49:28.020 align:start position:0%
