i'll be right here chair recognizes
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
marilyn hill i was going to say if you
 
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:21.680 align:start position:0%
can walk up here but you've already been
 
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:40.560 align:start position:0%
good morning jeremy peterson and the
 
00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:14:43.269 --> 00:14:43.279 align:start position:0%
marilyn hill and the ambulatory farms a
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
couple different things
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:50.870 --> 00:14:50.880 align:start position:0%
a beautiful infographic that one of my
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
colleagues made and then we also have an
 
00:14:54.389 --> 00:14:54.399 align:start position:0%
example of a collaborative practice
 
00:14:54.399 --> 00:14:55.509 align:start position:0%
example of a collaborative practice
agreement

00:14:55.509 --> 00:14:55.519 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
00:14:57.030 --> 00:14:57.040 align:start position:0%
before we get started i just want to
 
00:14:58.629 --> 00:14:58.639 align:start position:0%
unpack when we think of pharmacy
 
00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
practice you usually imagine getting
 
00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:02.560 align:start position:0%
your medication in a bag from the
 
00:15:04.949 --> 00:15:04.959 align:start position:0%
pharmacy this is separate and distinct
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
from that because this allows
 
00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:08.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacists to work in collaboration
 
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:10.720 align:start position:0%
with those prescribing providers to use
 
00:15:12.710 --> 00:15:12.720 align:start position:0%
their doctor degree to manage chronic
 
00:15:14.629 --> 00:15:14.639 align:start position:0%
disease states
 
00:15:17.030 --> 00:15:17.040 align:start position:0%
this isn't tied to the dispensing
 
00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:19.120 align:start position:0%
activities at all it can happen in any
 
00:15:20.790 --> 00:15:20.800 align:start position:0%
setting of health care
 
00:15:22.870 --> 00:15:22.880 align:start position:0%
but it is in close collaboration with
 
00:15:25.189 --> 00:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
that prescribing provider so
 
00:15:26.870 --> 00:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
the current statute
 
00:15:26.880 --> 00:15:28.550 align:start position:0%
the current statute
has

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:15:30.389 --> 00:15:30.399 align:start position:0%
directions on how to actually go about
 
00:15:32.310 --> 00:15:32.320 align:start position:0%
putting this together there are about 35
 
00:15:33.269 --> 00:15:33.279 align:start position:0%
different collaborative practice
 
00:15:34.790 --> 00:15:34.800 align:start position:0%
agreements in the state right now
 
00:15:36.230 --> 00:15:36.240 align:start position:0%
serving hundreds to thousands of
 
00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:37.670 align:start position:0%
serving hundreds to thousands of
patients

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:37.680 align:start position:0%
patients
 
00:15:40.389 --> 00:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
it is a technical legal document that
 
00:15:43.189 --> 00:15:43.199 align:start position:0%
has clinical information um that is
 
00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
signed by all the prescribing providers
 
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:46.800 align:start position:0%
by the pharmacist it's reviews by the
 
00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:48.560 align:start position:0%
board of pharmacy and the statute
 
00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:50.560 align:start position:0%
currently requires the patient to also
 
00:15:53.189 --> 00:15:53.199 align:start position:0%
sign this big intimidating package so
 
00:15:55.829 --> 00:15:55.839 align:start position:0%
this bill is to just strike that line
 
00:15:57.990 --> 00:15:58.000 align:start position:0%
from statute it does not affect informed
 
00:16:00.790 --> 00:16:00.800 align:start position:0%
consent law elsewhere in statute i'm not
 
00:16:02.230 --> 00:16:02.240 align:start position:0%
a lawyer so i don't know exactly where
 
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:04.880 align:start position:0%
that is but i know it exists um and this
 
00:16:06.629 --> 00:16:06.639 align:start position:0%
does not in any way affect the patient's
 
00:16:07.670 --> 00:16:07.680 align:start position:0%
choice of where to send their
 
00:16:10.230 --> 00:16:10.240 align:start position:0%
prescriptions when to participate in the
 
00:16:12.150 --> 00:16:12.160 align:start position:0%
health care system or anything of that
 
00:16:14.230 --> 00:16:14.240 align:start position:0%
nature so i'd love to turn it over to
 
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:17.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:23.110 --> 00:16:23.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
00:16:26.230 --> 00:16:26.240 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.430 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
just looking at this wonderful chart
 
00:16:33.590 --> 00:16:33.600 align:start position:0%
it looks like it the pharmacist takes on
 
00:16:35.910 --> 00:16:35.920 align:start position:0%
a lot more responsibility and i wanted
 
00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:37.920 align:start position:0%
to know if this was going to overburden
 
00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:39.350 align:start position:0%
to know if this was going to overburden
pharmacists

00:16:39.350 --> 00:16:39.360 align:start position:0%
pharmacists
 
00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:42.160 align:start position:0%
or if it actually makes their job easier
 
00:16:43.670 --> 00:16:43.680 align:start position:0%
that's a wonderful and very thoughtful
 
00:16:46.069 --> 00:16:46.079 align:start position:0%
question i appreciate that um the the
 
00:16:49.030 --> 00:16:49.040 align:start position:0%
law the amendment sorry the statute
 
00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:50.720 align:start position:0%
change in front of you does not at all
 
00:16:52.790 --> 00:16:52.800 align:start position:0%
affect the scope of practice currently
 
00:16:55.350 --> 00:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
so it will remain unchanged um the
 
00:16:57.749 --> 00:16:57.759 align:start position:0%
question in terms of like burden i can't
 
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:00.160 align:start position:0%
exactly speak to open up an area of
 
00:17:02.629 --> 00:17:02.639 align:start position:0%
practice known as ambulatory care
 
00:17:04.390 --> 00:17:04.400 align:start position:0%
that has been present in states across
 
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
the country for several decades it's
 
00:17:08.069 --> 00:17:08.079 align:start position:0%
pretty new to us in new hampshire
 
00:17:10.549 --> 00:17:10.559 align:start position:0%
but it is a really attractive place for
 
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:14.240 align:start position:0%
new practitioners to practice and the
 
00:17:15.429 --> 00:17:15.439 align:start position:0%
collaborative practice agreements
 
00:17:17.590 --> 00:17:17.600 align:start position:0%
enables that to happen
 
00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.710 align:start position:0%
enables that to happen
so

00:17:18.710 --> 00:17:18.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:21.110 --> 00:17:21.120 align:start position:0%
the burden is not touched by this
 
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:22.880 align:start position:0%
statute change
 
00:17:25.189 --> 00:17:25.199 align:start position:0%
but it is a cool place to practice
 
00:17:25.199 --> 00:17:26.949 align:start position:0%
but it is a cool place to practice
follow-up

00:17:26.949 --> 00:17:26.959 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:17:27.990 --> 00:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:29.270 align:start position:0%
thank you
um

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:29.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
does does this require a pharmacist to
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
get any more certifications or do they
 
00:17:36.630 --> 00:17:36.640 align:start position:0%
have to do they have to get
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
more education in how they deal with
 
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:41.360 align:start position:0%
patients i just a question yeah great
 
00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:17:45.990 --> 00:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
there is in the rules i believe it's in
 
00:17:48.630 --> 00:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
the rules basically in the application
 
00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:49.760 align:start position:0%
that's submitted to the board of
 
00:17:51.750 --> 00:17:51.760 align:start position:0%
pharmacy the pharmacist is required to
 
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:53.840 align:start position:0%
state their level of education and it's
 
00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:55.600 align:start position:0%
built into the hearing process before
 
00:17:57.590 --> 00:17:57.600 align:start position:0%
the board to determine if the pharmacist
 
00:17:59.430 --> 00:17:59.440 align:start position:0%
is has the education and background
 
00:18:01.350 --> 00:18:01.360 align:start position:0%
required to do the work that is outlined
 
00:18:03.029 --> 00:18:03.039 align:start position:0%
in the in the agreement
 
00:18:04.470 --> 00:18:04.480 align:start position:0%
so that's by the board of pharmacy i
 
00:18:05.909 --> 00:18:05.919 align:start position:0%
would say
 
00:18:08.070 --> 00:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you mr chair and thank
 
00:18:12.789 --> 00:18:12.799 align:start position:0%
you for taking my question how does the
 
00:18:20.549 --> 00:18:20.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:20.559 --> 00:18:21.830 align:start position:0%
 
the

00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:24.230 --> 00:18:24.240 align:start position:0%
results of blood tests things like that
 
00:18:26.870 --> 00:18:26.880 align:start position:0%
that would drive the change in the
 
00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.470 align:start position:0%
that would drive the change in the
prescription

00:18:28.470 --> 00:18:28.480 align:start position:0%
prescription
 
00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:30.720 align:start position:0%
a very operational question i am happy
 
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:34.240 align:start position:0%
to clarify and it kind of depends on
 
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:35.840 align:start position:0%
what setting it's taking place in so i
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
can speak to my staff they're embedded
 
00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:39.520 align:start position:0%
in primary care clinics working
 
00:18:41.909 --> 00:18:41.919 align:start position:0%
alongside with the providers who refer
 
00:18:43.990 --> 00:18:44.000 align:start position:0%
and sign this document so everything's
 
00:18:46.630 --> 00:18:46.640 align:start position:0%
in our electronic medical record um if
 
00:18:48.390 --> 00:18:48.400 align:start position:0%
things are crossing into different
 
00:18:49.909 --> 00:18:49.919 align:start position:0%
phases of care that would be an
 
00:18:51.909 --> 00:18:51.919 align:start position:0%
operational question for them to address
 
00:18:53.270 --> 00:18:53.280 align:start position:0%
i can't speak to that because all of my
 
00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
people are
 
00:18:57.029 --> 00:18:57.039 align:start position:0%
in in the same place as the uh referring
 
00:18:58.870 --> 00:18:58.880 align:start position:0%
provider it doesn't necessarily have to
 
00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:01.440 align:start position:0%
be that way um and
 
00:19:02.870 --> 00:19:02.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so i guess i can't answer that
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
fully follow-up
 
00:19:05.350 --> 00:19:05.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not quite i'm sure you're answering
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
my question i'm just not following the
 
00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.070 align:start position:0%
my question i'm just not following the
answer

00:19:12.070 --> 00:19:12.080 align:start position:0%
answer
 
00:19:15.430 --> 00:19:15.440 align:start position:0%
are the pharmacists given the same
 
00:19:18.230 --> 00:19:18.240 align:start position:0%
access to the testing
 
00:19:20.549 --> 00:19:20.559 align:start position:0%
or whatever you're monitoring this
 
00:19:22.310 --> 00:19:22.320 align:start position:0%
ongoing uh
 
00:19:25.669 --> 00:19:25.679 align:start position:0%
chronic condition how do the pharmacists
 
00:19:28.549 --> 00:19:28.559 align:start position:0%
get that information so they can make
 
00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:31.760 align:start position:0%
changes to the prescription yes so um
 
00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:34.160 align:start position:0%
the way my staff works they have the
 
00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:36.320 align:start position:0%
same access to the electronic medical
 
00:19:37.909 --> 00:19:37.919 align:start position:0%
record as everyone else in the clinic
 
00:19:40.230 --> 00:19:40.240 align:start position:0%
does so if you're a nurse or an ma or a
 
00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
physician who's going in to look at the
 
00:19:43.909 --> 00:19:43.919 align:start position:0%
patient's chart the blood tests are
 
00:19:47.029 --> 00:19:47.039 align:start position:0%
sitting there to review so um
 
00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:48.320 align:start position:0%
yeah they have the same access as
 
00:19:50.230 --> 00:19:50.240 align:start position:0%
everyone else i guess it's the answer to
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
your question for my team representative
 
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.630 align:start position:0%
your question for my team representative
soloway

00:19:54.630 --> 00:19:54.640 align:start position:0%
soloway
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman uh welcome dr
 
00:19:57.909 --> 00:19:57.919 align:start position:0%
hill it's nice to have you here and
 
00:19:59.830 --> 00:19:59.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question it's
 
00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
two-part question
 
00:20:03.430 --> 00:20:03.440 align:start position:0%
different issues okay um in my limited
 
00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.950 align:start position:0%
different issues okay um in my limited
experience

00:20:04.950 --> 00:20:04.960 align:start position:0%
experience
 
00:20:08.070 --> 00:20:08.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacists came in two flavors um
 
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
prescribing pharmacists and clinical
 
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480 align:start position:0%
pharmacists uh dispensing pharmacists
 
00:20:14.470 --> 00:20:14.480 align:start position:0%
and clinical pharmacists okay sure okay
 
00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:16.960 align:start position:0%
um and the clinical pharmacists are the
 
00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
ones who
 
00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.350 align:start position:0%
ones who
check

00:20:19.350 --> 00:20:19.360 align:start position:0%
check
 
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:22.320 align:start position:0%
the entire team for dosages drug
 
00:20:24.549 --> 00:20:24.559 align:start position:0%
interaction effects and so forth and
 
00:20:27.110 --> 00:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
they really operate as clinicians does
 
00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.909 align:start position:0%
they really operate as clinicians does
this

00:20:27.909 --> 00:20:27.919 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:20:27.919 --> 00:20:28.870 align:start position:0%
this
move

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:28.880 align:start position:0%
move
 
00:20:31.909 --> 00:20:31.919 align:start position:0%
the role of the dis of the dispensing
 
00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:34.240 align:start position:0%
pharmacist more in the direction of the
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
clinical pharmacist
 
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
the statute does not affect any piece of
 
00:20:40.630 --> 00:20:40.640 align:start position:0%
the different scopes that you're
 
00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:43.440 align:start position:0%
perceiving it it just removes the
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
signature required in the agreement that
 
00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:49.039 align:start position:0%
currently exists in statute
 
00:20:51.750 --> 00:20:51.760 align:start position:0%
it's just a piece of paperwork honestly
 
00:20:54.549 --> 00:20:54.559 align:start position:0%
so it doesn't change anything about
 
00:20:56.789 --> 00:20:56.799 align:start position:0%
practice besides we no longer need to
 
00:20:58.310 --> 00:20:58.320 align:start position:0%
have the patient sign a piece of paper
 
00:21:00.149 --> 00:21:00.159 align:start position:0%
keep that on file in case of audits and
 
00:21:02.390 --> 00:21:02.400 align:start position:0%
like keep track of that okay your second
 
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.590 align:start position:0%
like keep track of that okay your second
question

00:21:03.590 --> 00:21:03.600 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:21:07.830 --> 00:21:07.840 align:start position:0%
um does this change the role of um the
 
00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
farm tech
 
00:21:11.430 --> 00:21:11.440 align:start position:0%
no thank you
 
00:21:12.470 --> 00:21:12.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:14.880 align:start position:0%
representative canark thank you i want
 
00:21:16.310 --> 00:21:16.320 align:start position:0%
to make actually a point of information
 
00:21:17.669 --> 00:21:17.679 align:start position:0%
for the committee
 
00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
everything we just talked about is about
 
00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:20.720 align:start position:0%
the collaborative practice agreement
 
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:22.720 align:start position:0%
statute this does not affect that the
 
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:24.320 align:start position:0%
collaborative practice agreement is
 
00:21:26.070 --> 00:21:26.080 align:start position:0%
already in statute
 
00:21:28.149 --> 00:21:28.159 align:start position:0%
all this does is it unburdens the
 
00:21:29.750 --> 00:21:29.760 align:start position:0%
provider by saying you don't have to get
 
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:31.600 align:start position:0%
this separate signature
 
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:33.520 align:start position:0%
and the analogy if you look at the
 
00:21:35.669 --> 00:21:35.679 align:start position:0%
handout she gave as you don't sign
 
00:21:37.510 --> 00:21:37.520 align:start position:0%
something between your farm your pt and
 
00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
your doc the point is
 
00:21:41.750 --> 00:21:41.760 align:start position:0%
we're debating how this is structured
 
00:21:43.510 --> 00:21:43.520 align:start position:0%
it's already in statute we should not be
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
debating that to save us time because
 
00:21:47.029 --> 00:21:47.039 align:start position:0%
it's already in statute we should debate
 
00:21:49.430 --> 00:21:49.440 align:start position:0%
the bill at hand
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
representative merchant is a co-sponsor
 
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:53.440 align:start position:0%
so there's something you're not supposed
 
00:21:55.190 --> 00:21:55.200 align:start position:0%
to do but i'm going to call on you to do
 
00:21:57.350 --> 00:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
something else
 
00:21:58.950 --> 00:21:58.960 align:start position:0%
it's more a point of clarification than
 
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840 align:start position:0%
asking a question by me
 
00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280 align:start position:0%
the point of clarification is the
 
00:22:04.950 --> 00:22:04.960 align:start position:0%
collaborative practice the people that
 
00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:06.240 align:start position:0%
do this work
 
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:08.000 align:start position:0%
are working in the clinic
 
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:09.760 align:start position:0%
they're not i want to be sure people
 
00:22:11.909 --> 00:22:11.919 align:start position:0%
understand there's dispensing which is
 
00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:14.159 align:start position:0%
going to be what you see today in cvs
 
00:22:15.590 --> 00:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
walgreens and so forth that's not a
 
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
collaborative practice that's not where
 
00:22:18.549 --> 00:22:18.559 align:start position:0%
it's occurring the collaborative
 
00:22:20.230 --> 00:22:20.240 align:start position:0%
practice is like a physician assistant
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
working with a physician in the clinic
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
so therefore when you talk about the
 
00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:26.000 align:start position:0%
workload and burden and so forth that is
 
00:22:27.430 --> 00:22:27.440 align:start position:0%
not going to impact it because they're
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
not involved with the dispensing
 
00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:30.400 align:start position:0%
function involved if you will helping
 
00:22:31.909 --> 00:22:31.919 align:start position:0%
the physician with managing the therapy
 
00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:33.280 align:start position:0%
on behalf of the patient it's more
 
00:22:34.870 --> 00:22:34.880 align:start position:0%
informational than a question sir thank
 
00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
you so in other words let's not
 
00:22:38.789 --> 00:22:38.799 align:start position:0%
overthink this don't overthink it please
 
00:22:40.789 --> 00:22:40.799 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:22:42.149 --> 00:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:22:44.230 --> 00:22:44.240 align:start position:0%
doctor for being here um i think a lot
 
00:22:45.830 --> 00:22:45.840 align:start position:0%
of us are just trying to understand just
 
00:22:48.470 --> 00:22:48.480 align:start position:0%
how big this is and taking out that step
 
00:22:50.630 --> 00:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
um it seems like a great program are
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
there some parts that are reserved to
 
00:22:54.870 --> 00:22:54.880 align:start position:0%
the practitioner like the initial
 
00:22:56.390 --> 00:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
prescription of a continuous glucose
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
monitor and then that maintenance
 
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:00.640 align:start position:0%
happens um at the at the collaborative
 
00:23:02.070 --> 00:23:02.080 align:start position:0%
pharmacy agreement
 
00:23:03.909 --> 00:23:03.919 align:start position:0%
um that would depend on the specific
 
00:23:06.149 --> 00:23:06.159 align:start position:0%
agreement between the practitioner and
 
00:23:08.310 --> 00:23:08.320 align:start position:0%
the pharmacist so it certainly can be it
 
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:10.000 align:start position:0%
kind of varies depending on what
 
00:23:12.390 --> 00:23:12.400 align:start position:0%
resources and level of comfort currently
 
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:14.080 align:start position:0%
exists based on the relationships they
 
00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:14.950 align:start position:0%
exists based on the relationships they
have

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:14.960 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:15.830 align:start position:0%
have
um

00:23:15.830 --> 00:23:15.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:18.640 align:start position:0%
yeah customizable thank you yep
 
00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:20.400 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:23:21.909 --> 00:23:21.919 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you for
 
00:23:22.950 --> 00:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
taking my question i just heard
 
00:23:24.710 --> 00:23:24.720 align:start position:0%
clarification from what representative
 
00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.750 align:start position:0%
clarification from what representative
merchant

00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
merchant
 
00:23:28.310 --> 00:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
said this does not really affect
 
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:31.120 align:start position:0%
the right aid pharmacist they don't have
 
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:33.520 align:start position:0%
collaborative agreements it's only in
 
00:23:35.029 --> 00:23:35.039 align:start position:0%
the clinical setting
 
00:23:37.669 --> 00:23:37.679 align:start position:0%
um i don't work for rite aid so i cannot
 
00:23:39.909 --> 00:23:39.919 align:start position:0%
confirm or deny that um i know there's a
 
00:23:42.310 --> 00:23:42.320 align:start position:0%
variety throughout the state i don't i
 
00:23:44.390 --> 00:23:44.400 align:start position:0%
don't know if i don't think any
 
00:23:46.549 --> 00:23:46.559 align:start position:0%
currently exist in that sphere but again
 
00:23:48.710 --> 00:23:48.720 align:start position:0%
i can neither confirm nor deny that i'm
 
00:23:51.110 --> 00:23:51.120 align:start position:0%
gonna go out on a limb and ask our
 
00:23:57.669 --> 00:23:57.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:59.269 --> 00:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
during my time on the board of pharmacy
 
00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:00.640 align:start position:0%
there was no collaborative agreements
 
00:24:02.149 --> 00:24:02.159 align:start position:0%
between what caller retail community
 
00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:04.880 align:start position:0%
pharmacy and physicians offices and part
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
of that reason is if i may explain it
 
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:08.720 align:start position:0%
and somebody touched upon this in order
 
00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:10.000 align:start position:0%
to do collaborative agreement you have
 
00:24:11.669 --> 00:24:11.679 align:start position:0%
to have access to the medical record
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
because you have to understand where the
 
00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:13.750 align:start position:0%
because you have to understand where the
blood

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:13.760 align:start position:0%
blood
 
00:24:15.990 --> 00:24:16.000 align:start position:0%
levels are what's going on and so forth
 
00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.190 align:start position:0%
levels are what's going on and so forth
that

00:24:17.190 --> 00:24:17.200 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
access is because you work with inside
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
the clinic if you're working third party
 
00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
outside of the clinic to have access to
 
00:24:26.310 --> 00:24:26.320 align:start position:0%
that data is very problematic if not
 
00:24:28.789 --> 00:24:28.799 align:start position:0%
impossible so therefore the barrier
 
00:24:31.590 --> 00:24:31.600 align:start position:0%
between a community pharmacy involvement
 
00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:33.600 align:start position:0%
with collaborative practice and a
 
00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:35.520 align:start position:0%
physician prescribing if you will or a
 
00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
nurse practitioner is almost
 
00:24:39.110 --> 00:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
non-existent and during my time at the
 
00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:40.720 align:start position:0%
board there was no
 
00:24:43.110 --> 00:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
desire nor anything coming to the board
 
00:24:45.269 --> 00:24:45.279 align:start position:0%
because of those obstacles everything we
 
00:24:46.870 --> 00:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
saw before the board was definitely
 
00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:48.720 align:start position:0%
based in a clinic working with a
 
00:24:50.630 --> 00:24:50.640 align:start position:0%
prescribing provider
 
00:24:52.070 --> 00:24:52.080 align:start position:0%
hand in hand if you will because of that
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
reason of having access to the data and
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
ex faces records
 
00:24:58.310 --> 00:24:58.320 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:24:59.269 --> 00:24:59.279 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:25:01.909 --> 00:25:01.919 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chef uh then if i
 
00:25:03.669 --> 00:25:03.679 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly if that's the
 
00:25:03.679 --> 00:25:05.110 align:start position:0%
understand this correctly if that's the
situation

00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
situation
 
00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
uh this signature that we're getting rid
 
00:25:09.590 --> 00:25:09.600 align:start position:0%
of is actually redundant
 
00:25:11.830 --> 00:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
because when you come to a clinic
 
00:25:14.789 --> 00:25:14.799 align:start position:0%
you sign my understanding is you sign
 
00:25:17.269 --> 00:25:17.279 align:start position:0%
a release for treatment
 
00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:20.000 align:start position:0%
and that includes whatever the
 
00:25:22.390 --> 00:25:22.400 align:start position:0%
staff does and if the pharmacist is part
 
00:25:23.750 --> 00:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
of the staff
 
00:25:27.029 --> 00:25:27.039 align:start position:0%
then it's already taken care of so
 
00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:35.830 --> 00:25:35.840 align:start position:0%
i have in my notes uh something that uh
 
00:25:38.789 --> 00:25:38.799 align:start position:0%
best sergeant or lobbyist uh sent us all
 
00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
patient has already given consent with
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
the pcp for care so it's redundant
 
00:25:45.990 --> 00:25:46.000 align:start position:0%
so uh would anybody not like to ask
 
00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:49.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.710 --> 00:25:52.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
 
00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.070 align:start position:0%
thank you for your testimony thank you
the

00:25:54.070 --> 00:25:54.080 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:25:55.909 --> 00:25:55.919 align:start position:0%
this concludes the hearing on senate
 
00:26:00.230 --> 00:26:00.240 align:start position:0%
bill 335 and opens the exact session and
 
00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:02.960 align:start position:0%
the chair turns to
 
00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative merchant for a motion
 
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
i would happily make a motion ought to
 
00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:08.870 align:start position:0%
i would happily make a motion ought to
pass

00:26:08.870 --> 00:26:08.880 align:start position:0%

and i'll suck at that motion are you all
 
00:26:13.269 --> 00:26:13.279 align:start position:0%

290 and i open the exact session because
 
00:28:02.230 --> 00:28:02.240 align:start position:0%
we've already heard it at about twenty
 
00:28:05.669 --> 00:28:05.679 align:start position:0%
past eight last week in the evening
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
and we were probably remember some of it
 
00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
it was the relative to the practice of
 
00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:19.029 align:start position:0%
it was the relative to the practice of
auriculotherapy

00:28:19.029 --> 00:28:19.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:24.789 --> 00:28:24.799 align:start position:0%
ah yeah uh let's so fish out 290
 
00:28:27.909 --> 00:28:27.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
oh come on this is going to be a lot of
 
00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:30.090 align:start position:0%
oh come on this is going to be a lot of
fun

00:28:30.090 --> 00:28:30.100 align:start position:0%
fun
 
00:28:30.100 --> 00:28:37.269 align:start position:0%
fun
[Laughter]

00:28:37.269 --> 00:28:37.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:39.510 --> 00:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
everybody ready the chair recognizes
 
00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:41.990 align:start position:0%
everybody ready the chair recognizes
himself

00:28:41.990 --> 00:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
himself
 
00:28:44.630 --> 00:28:44.640 align:start position:0%
to make the motion for interim study do
 
00:28:46.470 --> 00:28:46.480 align:start position:0%
i have a second
 
00:28:48.870 --> 00:28:48.880 align:start position:0%
second who said that merchant merchant
 
00:28:51.269 --> 00:28:51.279 align:start position:0%
okay merchant
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
and i speak to that in that um
 
00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:56.710 align:start position:0%
and i speak to that in that um
gosh

00:28:56.710 --> 00:28:56.720 align:start position:0%
gosh
 
00:28:59.110 --> 00:28:59.120 align:start position:0%
many of us remember in medicine when
 
00:29:03.190 --> 00:29:03.200 align:start position:0%
there were doctors rns lpns and janitors
 
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:04.960 align:start position:0%
and over the years there have been
 
00:29:09.110 --> 00:29:09.120 align:start position:0%
numbers of slots in between those
 
00:29:12.149 --> 00:29:12.159 align:start position:0%
so the idea of training an individual up
 
00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:14.320 align:start position:0%
to a certain level
 
00:29:15.909 --> 00:29:15.919 align:start position:0%
certainly has merit
 
00:29:20.789 --> 00:29:20.799 align:start position:0%
if the need is there and you need an lpn
 
00:29:22.710 --> 00:29:22.720 align:start position:0%
you don't need to staff it with a nurse
 
00:29:24.710 --> 00:29:24.720 align:start position:0%
practitioner that slot
 
00:29:27.269 --> 00:29:27.279 align:start position:0%
so i'm convinced that there is a
 
00:29:30.389 --> 00:29:30.399 align:start position:0%
possibility theoretically for
 
00:29:30.399 --> 00:29:32.149 align:start position:0%
possibility theoretically for
um

00:29:32.149 --> 00:29:32.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:29:35.510 --> 00:29:35.520 align:start position:0%
what was brought to us
 
00:29:37.990 --> 00:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we want to make sure
 
00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:38.830 align:start position:0%
my concern is that we want to make sure
that

00:29:38.830 --> 00:29:38.840 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:29:41.830 --> 00:29:41.840 align:start position:0%
individuals are adequately trained
 
00:29:43.830 --> 00:29:43.840 align:start position:0%
i seem to recall that numbers of the
 
00:29:46.630 --> 00:29:46.640 align:start position:0%
people advocating for this had already
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
been extremely well trained over what is
 
00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.190 align:start position:0%
been extremely well trained over what is
necessary

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
00:29:53.110 --> 00:29:53.120 align:start position:0%
but there still seems to be the
 
00:29:55.190 --> 00:29:55.200 align:start position:0%
possibility somebody could come in off
 
00:29:57.029 --> 00:29:57.039 align:start position:0%
the street armed with five needles and
 
00:29:59.510 --> 00:29:59.520 align:start position:0%
go to work and we're not happy with that
 
00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:03.679 align:start position:0%
i don't think so by interim study i mean
 
00:30:05.669 --> 00:30:05.679 align:start position:0%
let's bring the participants together
 
00:30:08.070 --> 00:30:08.080 align:start position:0%
and thrash out something
 
00:30:11.830 --> 00:30:11.840 align:start position:0%
that we could be in favor of at a later
 
00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:14.480 align:start position:0%
date when it comes back to us so
 
00:30:16.870 --> 00:30:16.880 align:start position:0%
with that any further discussion or
 
00:30:19.029 --> 00:30:19.039 align:start position:0%
questions or what have you
 
00:30:21.669 --> 00:30:21.679 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
00:30:23.350 --> 00:30:23.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i would just say
 
00:30:26.149 --> 00:30:26.159 align:start position:0%
quickly that um
 
00:30:28.630 --> 00:30:28.640 align:start position:0%
while the bill it seems to me what did
 
00:30:30.950 --> 00:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
not adequately address accountability
 
00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:33.360 align:start position:0%
and training and standards
 
00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:34.960 align:start position:0%
we should remember that there's already
 
00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440 align:start position:0%
a statute that allows a certain group of
 
00:30:40.789 --> 00:30:40.799 align:start position:0%
people to do this most basic
 
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
auricular therapy and that will continue
 
00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:48.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:51.510 --> 00:30:51.520 align:start position:0%
in your opinion then what is the
 
00:30:54.789 --> 00:30:54.799 align:start position:0%
advantage to having the bill before us
 
00:30:57.110 --> 00:30:57.120 align:start position:0%
is there anything it adds that isn't
 
00:31:01.430 --> 00:31:01.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:03.750 --> 00:31:03.760 align:start position:0%
yes representative shapiro i'm not sure
 
00:31:06.389 --> 00:31:06.399 align:start position:0%
there is but um by sending it to interim
 
00:31:09.029 --> 00:31:09.039 align:start position:0%
study we allow
 
00:31:12.149 --> 00:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
the stakeholders to um
 
00:31:13.990 --> 00:31:14.000 align:start position:0%
more adequately address how they would
 
00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:16.840 align:start position:0%
expand what's being done now i think so
 
00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
00:31:20.549 --> 00:31:20.559 align:start position:0%
uh yes that's the thing i i think that
 
00:31:22.950 --> 00:31:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'm very troubled by this expanding the
 
00:31:25.830 --> 00:31:25.840 align:start position:0%
scope of practice but lessening the
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
00:31:30.149 --> 00:31:30.159 align:start position:0%
uh education training and certification
 
00:31:32.149 --> 00:31:32.159 align:start position:0%
with absolutely no accountability and
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
that just doesn't make any sense so i
 
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:36.640 align:start position:0%
agree with interim study if it's not the
 
00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:38.880 align:start position:0%
other motion uh that kills it quicker
 
00:31:40.789 --> 00:31:40.799 align:start position:0%
but either way i think interim study is
 
00:31:42.710 --> 00:31:42.720 align:start position:0%
a perfectly fine option for this i think
 
00:31:45.750 --> 00:31:45.760 align:start position:0%
interim study keeps us in the game right
 
00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:48.000 align:start position:0%
where it's just killing it
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
yeah i know it doesn't so much
 
00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:51.509 align:start position:0%
yeah i know it doesn't so much
yeah

00:31:51.509 --> 00:31:51.519 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:31:53.830 --> 00:31:53.840 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
00:31:55.430 --> 00:31:55.440 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:31:58.230 --> 00:31:58.240 align:start position:0%
also um
 
00:32:00.470 --> 00:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
as i said to a chair i missed last
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
tuesday uh which was kind of a long day
 
00:32:04.789 --> 00:32:04.799 align:start position:0%
but i did go back and listen to the tape
 
00:32:06.789 --> 00:32:06.799 align:start position:0%
or listen to the video not all of it but
 
00:32:08.789 --> 00:32:08.799 align:start position:0%
a lot of it and what i found very
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
interesting with auriculotherapy
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
was those who advocated for it when they
 
00:32:15.029 --> 00:32:15.039 align:start position:0%
talked about training
 
00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:16.320 align:start position:0%
they didn't say they didn't want to have
 
00:32:17.909 --> 00:32:17.919 align:start position:0%
training but the way the bill is written
 
00:32:19.509 --> 00:32:19.519 align:start position:0%
it's only training for
 
00:32:21.350 --> 00:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
sterile technique it's not training in a
 
00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:24.240 align:start position:0%
regular therapy so i think there's a
 
00:32:26.070 --> 00:32:26.080 align:start position:0%
need here to look at this through a
 
00:32:28.310 --> 00:32:28.320 align:start position:0%
study committee to begin to understand
 
00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:30.640 align:start position:0%
can we take the narda of which used for
 
00:32:32.549 --> 00:32:32.559 align:start position:0%
detox and possibly expand those
 
00:32:34.470 --> 00:32:34.480 align:start position:0%
individuals their scope or practice in
 
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:36.880 align:start position:0%
order to accommodate more things so i
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
think interim study will allow for that
 
00:32:40.149 --> 00:32:40.159 align:start position:0%
process to unfold and to bring the
 
00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:41.760 align:start position:0%
stakeholders together and talk about how
 
00:32:44.470 --> 00:32:44.480 align:start position:0%
we can use this therapy modality in a
 
00:32:53.909 --> 00:32:53.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:56.310 --> 00:32:56.320 align:start position:0%
representative gay i can always think of
 
00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.669 align:start position:0%
representative gay i can always think of
something

00:32:57.669 --> 00:32:57.679 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:32:57.679 --> 00:32:58.789 align:start position:0%
something
um

00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:00.789 --> 00:33:00.799 align:start position:0%
you mentioned you mentioned that some
 
00:33:02.549 --> 00:33:02.559 align:start position:0%
people are already practicing this and
 
00:33:04.389 --> 00:33:04.399 align:start position:0%
if i understood when they were
 
00:33:07.029 --> 00:33:07.039 align:start position:0%
testifying that there are people who are
 
00:33:08.950 --> 00:33:08.960 align:start position:0%
trained who are trained
 
00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:11.440 align:start position:0%
uh was it in the military so they're
 
00:33:14.950 --> 00:33:14.960 align:start position:0%
doing this but again they have training
 
00:33:18.630 --> 00:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
i i totally agree with the idea of i.s
 
00:33:21.029 --> 00:33:21.039 align:start position:0%
representative canark uh no the the ones
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
who testified such as dr nagle and
 
00:33:25.669 --> 00:33:25.679 align:start position:0%
others are trained acupuncturists when
 
00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:27.440 align:start position:0%
they are doing it the military has a
 
00:33:29.350 --> 00:33:29.360 align:start position:0%
program but even that requires training
 
00:33:34.950 --> 00:33:34.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:37.029 --> 00:33:37.039 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
00:33:38.710 --> 00:33:38.720 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair i think this issue of
 
00:33:42.070 --> 00:33:42.080 align:start position:0%
certification is is is in fact a very
 
00:33:43.750 --> 00:33:43.760 align:start position:0%
cogent issue
 
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:44.950 align:start position:0%
cogent issue
um

00:33:44.950 --> 00:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:33:47.110 --> 00:33:47.120 align:start position:0%
i'm just harking back to a suit that was
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
brought against myself
 
00:33:51.110 --> 00:33:51.120 align:start position:0%
as chair of the state workers comp
 
00:33:53.590 --> 00:33:53.600 align:start position:0%
advisory council
 
00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
about doing imes
 
00:33:59.350 --> 00:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
independent medical examinations
 
00:34:01.590 --> 00:34:01.600 align:start position:0%
and we had charlens coming across the
 
00:34:03.909 --> 00:34:03.919 align:start position:0%
border with quotes
 
00:34:03.919 --> 00:34:05.669 align:start position:0%
border with quotes
certifications

00:34:05.669 --> 00:34:05.679 align:start position:0%
certifications
 
00:34:07.669 --> 00:34:07.679 align:start position:0%
to do such
 
00:34:11.349 --> 00:34:11.359 align:start position:0%
it turns out there was 438 certifying
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
agencies in the u.s 130 of them in las
 
00:34:14.320 --> 00:34:16.629 align:start position:0%
agencies in the u.s 130 of them in las
vegas

00:34:16.629 --> 00:34:16.639 align:start position:0%
vegas
 
00:34:18.470 --> 00:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
what could go wrong there could go wrong
 
00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:19.310 align:start position:0%
what could go wrong there could go wrong
there

00:34:19.310 --> 00:34:19.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:20.470 align:start position:0%
there
[Music]

00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
so i had a bill brought forward that
 
00:34:25.669 --> 00:34:25.679 align:start position:0%
said to do imes you had to be board
 
00:34:28.629 --> 00:34:28.639 align:start position:0%
certified in one of the 26 specialties
 
00:34:30.470 --> 00:34:30.480 align:start position:0%
as identified by the american board of
 
00:34:32.790 --> 00:34:32.800 align:start position:0%
medical specialties
 
00:34:34.790 --> 00:34:34.800 align:start position:0%
so that raised a standard so you could
 
00:34:36.389 --> 00:34:36.399 align:start position:0%
still do them
 
00:34:38.069 --> 00:34:38.079 align:start position:0%
but there was a standard for which we
 
00:34:40.550 --> 00:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
felt it should be acceptable
 
00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.750 align:start position:0%
felt it should be acceptable
um

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:41.760 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:43.430 --> 00:34:43.440 align:start position:0%
as such that passed and i was
 
00:34:45.990 --> 00:34:46.000 align:start position:0%
subsequently sued by someone who did not
 
00:34:48.310 --> 00:34:48.320 align:start position:0%
have a board certification
 
00:34:50.869 --> 00:34:50.879 align:start position:0%
and uh ag's office gave me a call and
 
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:52.639 align:start position:0%
said what do you think and i told them
 
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:53.919 align:start position:0%
the reasoning and he said well we'll
 
00:34:55.909 --> 00:34:55.919 align:start position:0%
work on this
 
00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:58.000 align:start position:0%
and much to my
 
00:35:00.950 --> 00:35:00.960 align:start position:0%
relief about six weeks later he said we
 
00:35:03.990 --> 00:35:04.000 align:start position:0%
took care of it don't worry about it
 
00:35:07.030 --> 00:35:07.040 align:start position:0%
so i think there is a legal issue here
 
00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:08.240 align:start position:0%
as well
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
um and in the background would be
 
00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:12.470 align:start position:0%
um and in the background would be
potentially

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:12.480 align:start position:0%
potentially
 
00:35:14.550 --> 00:35:14.560 align:start position:0%
the same thing someone bringing a suit
 
00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:16.800 align:start position:0%
of restraint of trade
 
00:35:19.190 --> 00:35:19.200 align:start position:0%
but i think if we go through the process
 
00:35:22.470 --> 00:35:22.480 align:start position:0%
and put it on a standard basis
 
00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:24.880 align:start position:0%
and then looking at it from both sides
 
00:35:26.630 --> 00:35:26.640 align:start position:0%
through is
 
00:35:28.550 --> 00:35:28.560 align:start position:0%
that will be accomplished and that will
 
00:35:31.589 --> 00:35:31.599 align:start position:0%
provide a track record um for those who
 
00:35:33.109 --> 00:35:33.119 align:start position:0%
follow to say
 
00:35:35.349 --> 00:35:35.359 align:start position:0%
you've done due diligence so i'm very
 
00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760 align:start position:0%
you're helping me write my blurb keep it
 
00:35:44.550 --> 00:35:44.560 align:start position:0%
up guys
 
00:35:48.790 --> 00:35:48.800 align:start position:0%
i also noticed down here under um
 
00:35:51.349 --> 00:35:51.359 align:start position:0%
lowercase a has appropriate training in
 
00:35:53.510 --> 00:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
clean needle technique
 
00:35:54.790 --> 00:35:54.800 align:start position:0%
who says
 
00:35:57.430 --> 00:35:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.510 --> 00:35:59.520 align:start position:0%
no okay yeah who says you've had it and
 
00:36:01.030 --> 00:36:01.040 align:start position:0%
what is it
 
00:36:03.349 --> 00:36:03.359 align:start position:0%
i mean it begs the question
 
00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:06.480 align:start position:0%
uh my wife and i are plowing through um
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
the early years of the tv show law and
 
00:36:13.589 --> 00:36:13.599 align:start position:0%
order and in season 4 episode 21 the
 
00:36:13.599 --> 00:36:16.550 align:start position:0%
order and in season 4 episode 21 the
exact

00:36:16.550 --> 00:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:19.109 --> 00:36:19.119 align:start position:0%
the exact issue of does not purport to
 
00:36:21.349 --> 00:36:21.359 align:start position:0%
treat any disease disorder infirmity or
 
00:36:23.430 --> 00:36:23.440 align:start position:0%
affliction came up
 
00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.200 align:start position:0%
as the issue
 
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:27.280 align:start position:0%
because they were able to
 
00:36:29.030 --> 00:36:29.040 align:start position:0%
find and prove
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
that the person who was doing some
 
00:36:32.240 --> 00:36:33.430 align:start position:0%
that the person who was doing some
something

00:36:33.430 --> 00:36:33.440 align:start position:0%
something
 
00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
wasn't just saying
 
00:36:37.670 --> 00:36:37.680 align:start position:0%
i can't guarantee this will cure you but
 
00:36:40.470 --> 00:36:40.480 align:start position:0%
i do believe it won't hurt you
 
00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.069 align:start position:0%
i do believe it won't hurt you
sometimes

00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
but it shaded into what a reasonable
 
00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880 align:start position:0%
person would adhere
 
00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:48.150 align:start position:0%
person would adhere
as

00:36:48.150 --> 00:36:48.160 align:start position:0%
as
 
00:36:51.270 --> 00:36:51.280 align:start position:0%
this is a treatment for a disease
 
00:36:55.270 --> 00:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
so ripped from the headlines huh
 
00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:57.440 align:start position:0%
on that issue of does not purport to
 
00:36:59.670 --> 00:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
treat any disease disorder infirmity or
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
affliction do we just want to leave that
 
00:37:04.310 --> 00:37:04.320 align:start position:0%
hanging as such or might that be better
 
00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:10.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:12.069 --> 00:37:12.079 align:start position:0%

we're not running behind
 
00:38:58.630 --> 00:38:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh senate bill 281 i'd like to open the
 
00:39:01.670 --> 00:39:01.680 align:start position:0%
exact session on 281 we've already had
 
00:39:03.030 --> 00:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
the hearing
 
00:39:05.430 --> 00:39:05.440 align:start position:0%
and an act relative to nursing home
 
00:39:14.069 --> 00:39:14.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:17.670 --> 00:39:17.680 align:start position:0%
we have an amendment from weber
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.280 --> 00:40:08.470 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:10.240 align:start position:0%
okay let's take a look and read
 
00:40:13.589 --> 00:40:13.599 align:start position:0%
amendment 1335 as it's been passed
 
00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:17.829 align:start position:0%
amendment 1335 as it's been passed
around

00:40:17.829 --> 00:40:17.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:26.470 --> 00:40:26.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:28.960 align:start position:0%
yeah they got to read it
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
we're not going to pass it so we'll find
 
00:40:32.390 --> 00:40:32.400 align:start position:0%
out what's in it
 
00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:33.920 align:start position:0%
i will clarify for them what's in it so
 
00:40:34.870 --> 00:40:34.880 align:start position:0%
they know what they're doing what
 
00:40:37.589 --> 00:40:37.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:39.750 --> 00:40:39.760 align:start position:0%
let's try that yeah okay yeah all this
 
00:40:43.270 --> 00:40:43.280 align:start position:0%
does um if you recall on the bill
 
00:40:45.349 --> 00:40:45.359 align:start position:0%
lines five and six there was a sentence
 
00:40:46.950 --> 00:40:46.960 align:start position:0%
the month in which the resident dies
 
00:40:48.550 --> 00:40:48.560 align:start position:0%
shall be considered for the purpose of
 
00:40:49.829 --> 00:40:49.839 align:start position:0%
rent and fees the last month of
 
00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680 align:start position:0%
residency it was pointed out at the
 
00:40:53.750 --> 00:40:53.760 align:start position:0%
hearing that this was confusing because
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
this all has to do with making it 10
 
00:40:57.190 --> 00:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
days for the rent and fees so what the
 
00:40:59.190 --> 00:40:59.200 align:start position:0%
heck did this have to do with anything
 
00:41:00.870 --> 00:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
and we all agreed it should be removed
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
so that's all this does if you do the
 
00:41:05.109 --> 00:41:05.119 align:start position:0%
side by side of this you will find that
 
00:41:08.470 --> 00:41:08.480 align:start position:0%
that sentence is deleted that's all that
 
00:41:10.390 --> 00:41:10.400 align:start position:0%
happens because it only replaces
 
00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
fully section one section two is the
 
00:41:14.390 --> 00:41:14.400 align:start position:0%
effective date that stays there so
 
00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:16.240 align:start position:0%
that's the only change in this bill
 
00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319 align:start position:0%
we know that the other
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
nursing homes lobbied for 15 days um
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
lucy decided not to change that to keep
 
00:41:25.430 --> 00:41:25.440 align:start position:0%
it at the 10 because that seemed
 
00:41:26.630 --> 00:41:26.640 align:start position:0%
reasonable and i think that's what we
 
00:41:28.950 --> 00:41:28.960 align:start position:0%
all sort of felt at the hearing
 
00:41:33.190 --> 00:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:35.750 --> 00:41:35.760 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor senator gannon wanted
 
00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:39.680 align:start position:0%
it kept as is in the bill
 
00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:42.640 align:start position:0%
really that's what he said why
 
00:41:44.470 --> 00:41:44.480 align:start position:0%
no kept
 
00:41:44.480 --> 00:41:45.829 align:start position:0%
no kept
attend

00:41:45.829 --> 00:41:45.839 align:start position:0%
attend
 
00:41:47.190 --> 00:41:47.200 align:start position:0%
no yes i'm sorry i thought you meant the
 
00:41:48.390 --> 00:41:48.400 align:start position:0%
30 days
 
00:41:50.870 --> 00:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
we got rid of no no no yeah the 10. yes
 
00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
yes he testified that he was he thought
 
00:41:54.069 --> 00:41:54.079 align:start position:0%
10 was reasonable and so did we be all
 
00:41:58.710 --> 00:41:58.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:00.550 --> 00:42:00.560 align:start position:0%

would you like me to walk people through
 
00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.750 align:start position:0%
would you like me to walk people through
it

00:46:51.750 --> 00:46:51.760 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:46:53.349 --> 00:46:53.359 align:start position:0%
representative canark would you walk
 
00:46:57.190 --> 00:46:57.200 align:start position:0%
people through it please the thing so um
 
00:46:59.829 --> 00:46:59.839 align:start position:0%
just to remember what this bill is
 
00:47:02.069 --> 00:47:02.079 align:start position:0%
this was the one that developed
 
00:47:04.790 --> 00:47:04.800 align:start position:0%
actually directed dhhs to proceed with a
 
00:47:07.190 --> 00:47:07.200 align:start position:0%
snap outreach program
 
00:47:09.030 --> 00:47:09.040 align:start position:0%
they'd had one before uh they haven't
 
00:47:10.710 --> 00:47:10.720 align:start position:0%
done one for a while
 
00:47:12.470 --> 00:47:12.480 align:start position:0%
and we heard from the people
 
00:47:13.990 --> 00:47:14.000 align:start position:0%
representing the new hampshire food bank
 
00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:16.240 align:start position:0%
that it does a great deal of help to
 
00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:18.400 align:start position:0%
let people be aware of what is available
 
00:47:20.950 --> 00:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
in terms of snap benefits
 
00:47:23.990 --> 00:47:24.000 align:start position:0%
so that they can sign up and get it so
 
00:47:25.589 --> 00:47:25.599 align:start position:0%
this directed them to do it there were
 
00:47:27.670 --> 00:47:27.680 align:start position:0%
two concerns that were brought up by
 
00:47:31.589 --> 00:47:31.599 align:start position:0%
karen hebert who was uh from the bureau
 
00:47:36.710 --> 00:47:36.720 align:start position:0%
one was on line 13 of the bill
 
00:47:39.430 --> 00:47:39.440 align:start position:0%
so again the bill line 13
 
00:47:41.030 --> 00:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
when it said the outreach plan should be
 
00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:42.800 align:start position:0%
implemented within three months that is
 
00:47:45.349 --> 00:47:45.359 align:start position:0%
after approval by the usda
 
00:47:47.670 --> 00:47:47.680 align:start position:0%
the concern was that after it's approved
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
by the usda then it has to go out to bid
 
00:47:51.670 --> 00:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
with the procurement process has to go
 
00:47:52.710 --> 00:47:52.720 align:start position:0%
through the governor through the
 
00:47:54.150 --> 00:47:54.160 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
00:47:56.069 --> 00:47:56.079 align:start position:0%
and all that is likely to take a little
 
00:47:58.150 --> 00:47:58.160 align:start position:0%
bit longer than just three months
 
00:48:00.069 --> 00:48:00.079 align:start position:0%
so if you look at the amendment
 
00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:02.720 align:start position:0%
on line five
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
and by the way what this amendment does
 
00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:05.510 align:start position:0%
and by the way what this amendment does
replaces

00:48:05.510 --> 00:48:05.520 align:start position:0%
replaces
 
00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:06.790 align:start position:0%
replaces
section

00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:48:09.670 --> 00:48:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:10.870 --> 00:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
the first the first half of the
 
00:48:13.190 --> 00:48:13.200 align:start position:0%
amendment replaces section one just
 
00:48:14.549 --> 00:48:14.559 align:start position:0%
section a
 
00:48:16.549 --> 00:48:16.559 align:start position:0%
so what it does is it changes it on line
 
00:48:18.950 --> 00:48:18.960 align:start position:0%
five to six months
 
00:48:21.030 --> 00:48:21.040 align:start position:0%
but we did add a phrase following the
 
00:48:23.750 --> 00:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
state's current procurement process set
 
00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
by the department of administrative
 
00:48:25.359 --> 00:48:26.470 align:start position:0%
by the department of administrative
services

00:48:26.470 --> 00:48:26.480 align:start position:0%
services
 
00:48:28.630 --> 00:48:28.640 align:start position:0%
and that was just to make it clear
 
00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:29.349 align:start position:0%
and that was just to make it clear
that

00:48:29.349 --> 00:48:29.359 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:48:30.870 --> 00:48:30.880 align:start position:0%
it was a six-month period and it was
 
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:32.720 align:start position:0%
because of the procurement process that
 
00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:34.960 align:start position:0%
needs to be followed
 
00:48:36.950 --> 00:48:36.960 align:start position:0%
so that is one half
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
the other portion that they had that the
 
00:48:41.109 --> 00:48:41.119 align:start position:0%
department had some concerns about is in
 
00:48:43.990 --> 00:48:44.000 align:start position:0%
the bill on line 24
 
00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:46.400 align:start position:0%
it said the usda deadline for fiscal
 
00:48:48.309 --> 00:48:48.319 align:start position:0%
year 2023
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
they wanted us to change that to the
 
00:48:52.950 --> 00:48:52.960 align:start position:0%
state fiscal year so on line 11 of the
 
00:48:55.030 --> 00:48:55.040 align:start position:0%
amendment it changes it to the usda
 
00:48:58.549 --> 00:48:58.559 align:start position:0%
deadline for state fiscal year 20223 so
 
00:49:00.870 --> 00:49:00.880 align:start position:0%
all that does is identify
 
00:49:02.950 --> 00:49:02.960 align:start position:0%
whose fiscal year the federal government
 
00:49:04.630 --> 00:49:04.640 align:start position:0%
versus the state keep it together with
 
00:49:06.069 --> 00:49:06.079 align:start position:0%
the state
 
00:49:07.750 --> 00:49:07.760 align:start position:0%
so that's all the amendment does it just
 
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
simply increases it for three months to
 
00:49:11.349 --> 00:49:11.359 align:start position:0%
six months and it reinforces that they
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
have to go through the procurement
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
process and then it makes it the state
 
00:49:18.309 --> 00:49:18.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:19.920 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
00:49:21.589 --> 00:49:21.599 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman and thank you
 
00:49:23.109 --> 00:49:23.119 align:start position:0%
representative kanark for bringing this
 
00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:25.040 align:start position:0%
amendment those were definitely
 
00:49:27.109 --> 00:49:27.119 align:start position:0%
important issues that were brought up by
 
00:49:28.470 --> 00:49:28.480 align:start position:0%
karen hebert
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
i want to make sure everybody received
 
00:49:33.349 --> 00:49:33.359 align:start position:0%
the email from karen hubert as well um
 
00:49:35.349 --> 00:49:35.359 align:start position:0%
just to let everybody know she was asked
 
00:49:36.870 --> 00:49:36.880 align:start position:0%
why the department discontinued the
 
00:49:39.109 --> 00:49:39.119 align:start position:0%
program after 2017
 
00:49:41.030 --> 00:49:41.040 align:start position:0%
and the data that she was able to report
 
00:49:43.589 --> 00:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
from they had received 299 applications
 
00:49:46.069 --> 00:49:46.079 align:start position:0%
per snap as a result of the outreach
 
00:49:48.710 --> 00:49:48.720 align:start position:0%
of those applications 107 were opened
 
00:49:51.510 --> 00:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
and the remaining 192 were denied mostly
 
00:49:53.109 --> 00:49:53.119 align:start position:0%
for being over income or failure to
 
00:49:55.190 --> 00:49:55.200 align:start position:0%
provide information and others withdrew
 
00:49:57.510 --> 00:49:57.520 align:start position:0%
or didn't show up for the appointments
 
00:49:59.670 --> 00:49:59.680 align:start position:0%
and for comparison purposes she stated
 
00:50:01.109 --> 00:50:01.119 align:start position:0%
that without an outreach program in
 
00:50:03.109 --> 00:50:03.119 align:start position:0%
place during the weeks ended march 4th
 
00:50:05.990 --> 00:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
and march 25th of 2022 alone which was
 
00:50:09.109 --> 00:50:09.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:11.190 --> 00:50:11.200 align:start position:0%
for that time period the department
 
00:50:14.790 --> 00:50:14.800 align:start position:0%
opened 4 415 snap cases and denied
 
00:50:17.910 --> 00:50:17.920 align:start position:0%
another 2 244 for similar reasons to
 
00:50:17.920 --> 00:50:18.790 align:start position:0%
another 2 244 for similar reasons to
above

00:50:18.790 --> 00:50:18.800 align:start position:0%
above
 
00:50:20.950 --> 00:50:20.960 align:start position:0%
um and she further said it may be
 
00:50:23.430 --> 00:50:23.440 align:start position:0%
reasonable to say that 107 cases open as
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
a result of outreach was not an
 
00:50:26.630 --> 00:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
effective outcome and it may have
 
00:50:28.069 --> 00:50:28.079 align:start position:0%
subjected the program to further
 
00:50:31.589 --> 00:50:31.599 align:start position:0%
evaluation so it seems that that that
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.510 align:start position:0%
 
representative

00:50:37.510 --> 00:50:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:50:38.950 --> 00:50:38.960 align:start position:0%
yes i did read that i think there's one
 
00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
important thing to look at though and
 
00:50:42.549 --> 00:50:42.559 align:start position:0%
that's the time frame
 
00:50:43.990 --> 00:50:44.000 align:start position:0%
the data when they were doing the
 
00:50:47.510 --> 00:50:47.520 align:start position:0%
outreach was 2015 to 2017.
 
00:50:48.710 --> 00:50:48.720 align:start position:0%
the data
 
00:50:49.750 --> 00:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
without that
 
00:50:53.109 --> 00:50:53.119 align:start position:0%
outreach was march of 2022
 
00:50:54.630 --> 00:50:54.640 align:start position:0%
in case somebody's been in a cave the
 
00:50:56.150 --> 00:50:56.160 align:start position:0%
last few years there's been a little bit
 
00:50:57.589 --> 00:50:57.599 align:start position:0%
of a problem that's gone on over the
 
00:51:00.549 --> 00:51:00.559 align:start position:0%
last two years with the pandemic
 
00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
with the economy not doing particularly
 
00:51:03.280 --> 00:51:04.069 align:start position:0%
with the economy not doing particularly
well

00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:51:05.270 --> 00:51:05.280 align:start position:0%
for the last
 
00:51:06.790 --> 00:51:06.800 align:start position:0%
couple of years and it was booming
 
00:51:09.990 --> 00:51:10.000 align:start position:0%
rather well back in 2015-17
 
00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.870 align:start position:0%
rather well back in 2015-17
people

00:51:10.870 --> 00:51:10.880 align:start position:0%
people
 
00:51:12.150 --> 00:51:12.160 align:start position:0%
need snap
 
00:51:14.069 --> 00:51:14.079 align:start position:0%
when they're having trouble financially
 
00:51:15.750 --> 00:51:15.760 align:start position:0%
they generally don't need not as many
 
00:51:18.069 --> 00:51:18.079 align:start position:0%
people need snap when they're doing well
 
00:51:19.670 --> 00:51:19.680 align:start position:0%
so the problem with this as with any
 
00:51:20.710 --> 00:51:20.720 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
00:51:22.390 --> 00:51:22.400 align:start position:0%
study that one does with an historical
 
00:51:23.750 --> 00:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
control because that's what this is in
 
00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:25.119 align:start position:0%
terms of a study design it's a
 
00:51:26.870 --> 00:51:26.880 align:start position:0%
historical control
 
00:51:29.190 --> 00:51:29.200 align:start position:0%
it is an entirely different period of
 
00:51:31.829 --> 00:51:31.839 align:start position:0%
history and that's always the fallacy in
 
00:51:33.510 --> 00:51:33.520 align:start position:0%
using historical controls unless you
 
00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:35.920 align:start position:0%
know that the factors that would the
 
00:51:38.069 --> 00:51:38.079 align:start position:0%
confounding factors that would influence
 
00:51:39.589 --> 00:51:39.599 align:start position:0%
were the same the compounding factors
 
00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:41.920 align:start position:0%
that influenced so the economy it was
 
00:51:43.430 --> 00:51:43.440 align:start position:0%
vastly different in the early part of
 
00:51:46.630 --> 00:51:46.640 align:start position:0%
2022 than it was in 2015-17
 
00:51:48.390 --> 00:51:48.400 align:start position:0%
so it was nice she provided this but
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
it's totally useless data
 
00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
from their data standpoint
 
00:51:55.190 --> 00:51:55.200 align:start position:0%
representative leon um thank you mr
 
00:51:56.950 --> 00:51:56.960 align:start position:0%
chairman while they do represent
 
00:51:58.630 --> 00:51:58.640 align:start position:0%
different time periods i think my
 
00:52:00.150 --> 00:52:00.160 align:start position:0%
biggest takeaway especially as an
 
00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:01.270 align:start position:0%
biggest takeaway especially as an
economist

00:52:01.270 --> 00:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
economist
 
00:52:02.870 --> 00:52:02.880 align:start position:0%
recognizes that people see that there
 
00:52:04.790 --> 00:52:04.800 align:start position:0%
are these opportunities people know that
 
00:52:07.270 --> 00:52:07.280 align:start position:0%
there's need and people most importantly
 
00:52:09.430 --> 00:52:09.440 align:start position:0%
know this program exists
 
00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:11.200 align:start position:0%
that's the whole point of snap outreach
 
00:52:13.190 --> 00:52:13.200 align:start position:0%
is to let people know about it
 
00:52:15.109 --> 00:52:15.119 align:start position:0%
and i think that i think that that
 
00:52:16.710 --> 00:52:16.720 align:start position:0%
information is out there and i think the
 
00:52:18.470 --> 00:52:18.480 align:start position:0%
department's efforts and resources are
 
00:52:21.990 --> 00:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:24.309 --> 00:52:24.319 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
00:52:27.910 --> 00:52:27.920 align:start position:0%
um yes i looked at those numbers as well
 
00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.950 align:start position:0%
um yes i looked at those numbers as well
and

00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:31.270 --> 00:52:31.280 align:start position:0%
what i really took from it was when
 
00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:34.319 align:start position:0%
people are in need they go looking
 
00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:35.589 align:start position:0%
people are in need they go looking
and

00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:52:37.589 --> 00:52:37.599 align:start position:0%
they were able to find it obviously
 
00:52:39.190 --> 00:52:39.200 align:start position:0%
pretty well
 
00:52:42.069 --> 00:52:42.079 align:start position:0%
even during a pandemic
 
00:52:45.910 --> 00:52:45.920 align:start position:0%
if nothing else they went online but um
 
00:52:48.870 --> 00:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
so i'm not so sure that we necessarily
 
00:52:51.750 --> 00:52:51.760 align:start position:0%
need an outreach program and
 
00:52:53.510 --> 00:52:53.520 align:start position:0%
just the whole fact that you would have
 
00:52:55.349 --> 00:52:55.359 align:start position:0%
to send it through the whole
 
00:52:58.630 --> 00:52:58.640 align:start position:0%
bidding process and all of that
 
00:53:00.710 --> 00:53:00.720 align:start position:0%
it's going to take up a lot of time
 
00:53:02.069 --> 00:53:02.079 align:start position:0%
through the governor's office the
 
00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:04.400 align:start position:0%
executive council everybody's going to
 
00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:06.960 align:start position:0%
have to spend a lot of time on this
 
00:53:09.349 --> 00:53:09.359 align:start position:0%
and i think there's time could be spent
 
00:53:12.230 --> 00:53:12.240 align:start position:0%
better when people nowadays are
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
are getting more and more resourceful
 
00:53:17.750 --> 00:53:17.760 align:start position:0%
about finding help on their own
 
00:53:23.349 --> 00:53:23.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:24.880 align:start position:0%
sometimes we seem to go on the
 
00:53:26.870 --> 00:53:26.880 align:start position:0%
assumption that everyone has internet
 
00:53:29.670 --> 00:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
access or computer or phone that can
 
00:53:31.510 --> 00:53:31.520 align:start position:0%
search these things out
 
00:53:33.990 --> 00:53:34.000 align:start position:0%
and i know that to not be the case for
 
00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:36.400 align:start position:0%
some of my neighbors
 
00:53:37.829 --> 00:53:37.839 align:start position:0%
if if
 
00:53:40.230 --> 00:53:40.240 align:start position:0%
passing this snap
 
00:53:41.750 --> 00:53:41.760 align:start position:0%
outreach program
 
00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:42.790 align:start position:0%
outreach program
feeds

00:53:42.790 --> 00:53:42.800 align:start position:0%
feeds
 
00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
20 more families it's worth it so i'm
 
00:53:51.910 --> 00:53:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:53.990 --> 00:53:54.000 align:start position:0%
representative query
 
00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.670 --> 00:53:59.680 align:start position:0%
i knew this i actually never have heard
 
00:54:01.510 --> 00:54:01.520 align:start position:0%
it before and he said it to me earlier
 
00:54:03.510 --> 00:54:03.520 align:start position:0%
and i was like you gotta say that um i'm
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
surprised anyways
 
00:54:08.150 --> 00:54:08.160 align:start position:0%
oh and it gets better because your first
 
00:54:11.030 --> 00:54:11.040 align:start position:0%
name is joshua right yeah in hebrew it's
 
00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:14.160 align:start position:0%
yeshua so i'm going to ask you are you
 
00:54:19.190 --> 00:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm out of material you may continue
 
00:54:23.430 --> 00:54:23.440 align:start position:0%
all right um
 
00:54:25.510 --> 00:54:25.520 align:start position:0%
i just want to build off of a
 
00:54:28.309 --> 00:54:28.319 align:start position:0%
representative uh nutter upham's point
 
00:54:28.319 --> 00:54:29.349 align:start position:0%
representative uh nutter upham's point
um

00:54:29.349 --> 00:54:29.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:31.990 --> 00:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
in early 2020 i
 
00:54:33.349 --> 00:54:33.359 align:start position:0%
like many other people found themselves
 
00:54:33.359 --> 00:54:34.710 align:start position:0%
like many other people found themselves
unemployed

00:54:34.710 --> 00:54:34.720 align:start position:0%
unemployed
 
00:54:36.789 --> 00:54:36.799 align:start position:0%
but however i was in the financial
 
00:54:39.910 --> 00:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
situation where that wasn't as big of a
 
00:54:42.549 --> 00:54:42.559 align:start position:0%
thing for many others so what i found
 
00:54:44.549 --> 00:54:44.559 align:start position:0%
myself doing was volunteering at the
 
00:54:46.870 --> 00:54:46.880 align:start position:0%
manchester welfare department
 
00:54:49.190 --> 00:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
my job entirely for the four months that
 
00:54:50.630 --> 00:54:50.640 align:start position:0%
i was there
 
00:54:54.309 --> 00:54:54.319 align:start position:0%
was signing up people who were coming in
 
00:54:58.150 --> 00:54:58.160 align:start position:0%
for other reasons for snap benefits they
 
00:55:00.470 --> 00:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
did not know that that was a thing
 
00:55:02.069 --> 00:55:02.079 align:start position:0%
even though they knew to come to the
 
00:55:04.309 --> 00:55:04.319 align:start position:0%
welfare department so i really do think
 
00:55:06.710 --> 00:55:06.720 align:start position:0%
an outreach program even if it is just
 
00:55:08.549 --> 00:55:08.559 align:start position:0%
to point them in the direction of their
 
00:55:10.150 --> 00:55:10.160 align:start position:0%
welfare departments
 
00:55:12.950 --> 00:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
would be a very useful uh
 
00:55:15.990 --> 00:55:16.000 align:start position:0%
you know useful for their time
 
00:55:18.470 --> 00:55:18.480 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
00:55:20.870 --> 00:55:20.880 align:start position:0%
to follow up on what you're saying about
 
00:55:22.630 --> 00:55:22.640 align:start position:0%
people coming for help
 
00:55:25.349 --> 00:55:25.359 align:start position:0%
at least those people do get notified
 
00:55:27.670 --> 00:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
about snap and for the people who don't
 
00:55:29.750 --> 00:55:29.760 align:start position:0%
go to welfare
 
00:55:31.190 --> 00:55:31.200 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking
 
00:55:34.390 --> 00:55:34.400 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't hurt to post
 
00:55:37.910 --> 00:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
but ask for a poster to be put in all
 
00:55:41.670 --> 00:55:41.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:45.430 --> 00:55:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.430 --> 00:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
00:55:49.990 --> 00:55:50.000 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair
 
00:55:51.910 --> 00:55:51.920 align:start position:0%
in regards to this
 
00:55:55.109 --> 00:55:55.119 align:start position:0%
issue i look at it slightly differently
 
00:55:57.349 --> 00:55:57.359 align:start position:0%
when we look at the numbers
 
00:55:59.109 --> 00:55:59.119 align:start position:0%
back for two years we were in a
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
relatively strong economic position a
 
00:56:04.549 --> 00:56:04.559 align:start position:0%
lot of people didn't need to have snap
 
00:56:07.349 --> 00:56:07.359 align:start position:0%
when you look at the four weeks in march
 
00:56:09.589 --> 00:56:09.599 align:start position:0%
there was 2171
 
00:56:11.510 --> 00:56:11.520 align:start position:0%
qualified for snap
 
00:56:13.430 --> 00:56:13.440 align:start position:0%
which is a large number
 
00:56:15.430 --> 00:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
in many of those people probably for the
 
00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
first time in their lives needed to have
 
00:56:19.670 --> 00:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
public assistance
 
00:56:21.829 --> 00:56:21.839 align:start position:0%
not because they chose it but because
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
the economy went against them
 
00:56:25.589 --> 00:56:25.599 align:start position:0%
and i think at this point in time we're
 
00:56:27.430 --> 00:56:27.440 align:start position:0%
still in a pandemic we have not got out
 
00:56:28.630 --> 00:56:28.640 align:start position:0%
of it
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
i believe at this point in time building
 
00:56:32.710 --> 00:56:32.720 align:start position:0%
awareness for people to at least have
 
00:56:34.710 --> 00:56:34.720 align:start position:0%
access to the program
 
00:56:36.789 --> 00:56:36.799 align:start position:0%
is not only helpful to them but to us as
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
a country because when they're not
 
00:56:41.829 --> 00:56:41.839 align:start position:0%
getting the supplements that they need
 
00:56:44.470 --> 00:56:44.480 align:start position:0%
particularly children folks
 
00:56:46.630 --> 00:56:46.640 align:start position:0%
they go to the schools hungry and if you
 
00:56:48.789 --> 00:56:48.799 align:start position:0%
ever been inside of a school and
 
00:56:50.230 --> 00:56:50.240 align:start position:0%
dealt with children with an empty
 
00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.510 align:start position:0%
dealt with children with an empty
stomach

00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:51.520 align:start position:0%
stomach
 
00:56:53.430 --> 00:56:53.440 align:start position:0%
it's hard they don't learn the
 
00:56:57.270 --> 00:56:57.280 align:start position:0%
consequences to us as a society is huge
 
00:56:58.710 --> 00:56:58.720 align:start position:0%
because when they don't have a good
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
education to begin with
 
00:57:02.470 --> 00:57:02.480 align:start position:0%
long term we're paying more than what
 
00:57:04.470 --> 00:57:04.480 align:start position:0%
the staff would cost us so from an
 
00:57:06.390 --> 00:57:06.400 align:start position:0%
economic point of view this is in my
 
00:57:08.390 --> 00:57:08.400 align:start position:0%
opinion very cost effective
 
00:57:10.470 --> 00:57:10.480 align:start position:0%
because if you're helping the children
 
00:57:13.109 --> 00:57:13.119 align:start position:0%
when they're young go to school
 
00:57:15.349 --> 00:57:15.359 align:start position:0%
with a full belly full belly and have
 
00:57:16.950 --> 00:57:16.960 align:start position:0%
the ability to learn the way they should
 
00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.470 align:start position:0%
the ability to learn the way they should
learn

00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
learn
 
00:57:21.030 --> 00:57:21.040 align:start position:0%
for us as a society cost us far less
 
00:57:22.789 --> 00:57:22.799 align:start position:0%
than the money this is going to cost us
 
00:57:25.109 --> 00:57:25.119 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:57:26.710 --> 00:57:26.720 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
00:57:28.390 --> 00:57:28.400 align:start position:0%
thanks i wanted to respond to
 
00:57:30.150 --> 00:57:30.160 align:start position:0%
representative gay's comment about
 
00:57:32.950 --> 00:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
posters that could for example be
 
00:57:35.430 --> 00:57:35.440 align:start position:0%
part of the outreach program or could be
 
00:57:37.109 --> 00:57:37.119 align:start position:0%
the entire outreach program that's the
 
00:57:38.549 --> 00:57:38.559 align:start position:0%
whole point this just asks them to
 
00:57:40.390 --> 00:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
develop an outreach program
 
00:57:42.150 --> 00:57:42.160 align:start position:0%
and then they would look at what are the
 
00:57:43.829 --> 00:57:43.839 align:start position:0%
most effective ways to get that
 
00:57:45.430 --> 00:57:45.440 align:start position:0%
information out it may be posters in
 
00:57:48.230 --> 00:57:48.240 align:start position:0%
grocery stores it may also be posters in
 
00:57:50.710 --> 00:57:50.720 align:start position:0%
a post office and other things like that
 
00:57:52.470 --> 00:57:52.480 align:start position:0%
so that's the point is this does not
 
00:57:54.549 --> 00:57:54.559 align:start position:0%
identify how they do it it just directs
 
00:57:56.630 --> 00:57:56.640 align:start position:0%
them to do it and that might be one of
 
00:57:57.910 --> 00:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
the things the other thing i point out
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
there just as a continuation we might
 
00:58:01.910 --> 00:58:01.920 align:start position:0%
want to recess this because senator
 
00:58:03.990 --> 00:58:04.000 align:start position:0%
apprentice is carefully uh patiently
 
00:58:05.750 --> 00:58:05.760 align:start position:0%
waiting for her bill which is now three
 
00:58:07.190 --> 00:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
minutes overdue
 
00:58:08.549 --> 00:58:08.559 align:start position:0%
so we we might want to come back i'd
 
00:58:11.109 --> 00:58:11.119 align:start position:0%
like to continue up until the amendment
 
00:58:11.119 --> 00:58:14.549 align:start position:0%
like to continue up until the amendment
process

00:58:14.549 --> 00:58:14.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:16.630 --> 00:58:16.640 align:start position:0%
anything further representative soloway
 
00:58:19.750 --> 00:58:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman just quickly um
 
00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:22.240 align:start position:0%
this is a cheap program the feds pay the
 
00:58:24.789 --> 00:58:24.799 align:start position:0%
bulk of it or a major portion of it
 
00:58:27.190 --> 00:58:27.200 align:start position:0%
the target population is the least
 
00:58:30.789 --> 00:58:30.799 align:start position:0%
capable population in the state
 
00:58:33.349 --> 00:58:33.359 align:start position:0%
if we manage to feed
 
00:58:36.230 --> 00:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
a dozen more families that we wouldn't
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
have fed otherwise it will all have been
 
00:58:44.230 --> 00:58:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.150 --> 00:58:46.160 align:start position:0%
seeing no further
 
00:58:47.990 --> 00:58:48.000 align:start position:0%
representative merchant just the
 
00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:49.680 align:start position:0%
follow-up and representatives always
 
00:58:52.069 --> 00:58:52.079 align:start position:0%
comment but i look at the fiscal note
 
00:58:54.710 --> 00:58:54.720 align:start position:0%
there's no cost to state with this
 
00:58:56.470 --> 00:58:56.480 align:start position:0%
so there's no downside as far as an
 
00:58:57.990 --> 00:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
expense this is not going to hit a
 
00:58:59.990 --> 00:59:00.000 align:start position:0%
general treasury at all
 
00:59:02.150 --> 00:59:02.160 align:start position:0%
but the upside for a lot of those who
 
00:59:04.470 --> 00:59:04.480 align:start position:0%
need the assistance is huge
 
00:59:04.480 --> 00:59:05.190 align:start position:0%
need the assistance is huge
so

00:59:05.190 --> 00:59:05.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:59:07.109 --> 00:59:07.119 align:start position:0%
from an economic point of view this is
 
00:59:09.030 --> 00:59:09.040 align:start position:0%
not going to come to the state treasury
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
for us to bail it out this is a program
 
00:59:13.030 --> 00:59:13.040 align:start position:0%
coming from uncle sam if you will which
 
00:59:15.030 --> 00:59:15.040 align:start position:0%
ultimate comes from us but still
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
it doesn't cost us here and the
 
00:59:19.510 --> 00:59:19.520 align:start position:0%
taxpayers in new hampshire any dollars
 
00:59:22.789 --> 00:59:22.799 align:start position:0%
i'm looking at an unnumbered the lines
 
00:59:24.950 --> 00:59:24.960 align:start position:0%
aren't numbered in what i printed out
 
00:59:28.870 --> 00:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
but if i go down under 13 b about six or
 
00:59:31.670 --> 00:59:31.680 align:start position:0%
seven lines
 
00:59:33.430 --> 00:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
nothing in this paragraph shall be
 
00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:35.200 align:start position:0%
construed to prevent the department's
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
use of available general fund
 
00:59:38.950 --> 00:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
appropriations for the purpose of this
 
00:59:41.349 --> 00:59:41.359 align:start position:0%
paragraph if there are insufficient
 
00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:44.160 align:start position:0%
federal or private funds available
 
00:59:46.309 --> 00:59:46.319 align:start position:0%
how does that speak representative
 
00:59:46.319 --> 00:59:47.750 align:start position:0%
how does that speak representative
kanark

00:59:47.750 --> 00:59:47.760 align:start position:0%
kanark
 
00:59:50.150 --> 00:59:50.160 align:start position:0%
sorry in the fiscal note the comment is
 
00:59:52.710 --> 00:59:52.720 align:start position:0%
that um
 
00:59:54.309 --> 00:59:54.319 align:start position:0%
it is expected to that this can be
 
00:59:55.829 --> 00:59:55.839 align:start position:0%
accomplished within the department's
 
00:59:58.150 --> 00:59:58.160 align:start position:0%
existing budget the point is they expect
 
01:00:00.150 --> 01:00:00.160 align:start position:0%
they will have the appropriate gifts um
 
01:00:01.910 --> 01:00:01.920 align:start position:0%
that's apparently already lined up but
 
01:00:03.589 --> 01:00:03.599 align:start position:0%
the issue is they didn't want to have to
 
01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:05.280 align:start position:0%
come back if that one of those fell
 
01:00:06.630 --> 01:00:06.640 align:start position:0%
through and they needed an extra twenty
 
01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:07.750 align:start position:0%
through and they needed an extra twenty
dollars

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:00:09.430 --> 01:00:09.440 align:start position:0%
so they don't have to even ask for an
 
01:00:11.109 --> 01:00:11.119 align:start position:0%
appropriation it's already can be
 
01:00:12.549 --> 01:00:12.559 align:start position:0%
covered in the existing budget
 
01:00:14.950 --> 01:00:14.960 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
01:00:17.510 --> 01:00:17.520 align:start position:0%
um in the methodology portion of the
 
01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:19.440 align:start position:0%
fiscal note it says the department is
 
01:00:21.589 --> 01:00:21.599 align:start position:0%
unable to estimate the amount of funds
 
01:00:23.589 --> 01:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
that that may be received or any
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
resulting impact on the unit utilization
 
01:00:29.190 --> 01:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
of snap benefits
 
01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:30.069 align:start position:0%
of snap benefits
so

01:00:30.069 --> 01:00:30.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:00:32.470 --> 01:00:32.480 align:start position:0%
i don't know how they can say they can
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
cover it in their program when they are
 
01:00:36.470 --> 01:00:36.480 align:start position:0%
unable to estimate the difference it
 
01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:39.520 align:start position:0%
costs well that's received
 
01:00:41.990 --> 01:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
as revenue
 
01:00:43.829 --> 01:00:43.839 align:start position:0%
that's not cost
 
01:00:45.030 --> 01:00:45.040 align:start position:0%
in other words these this is this is
 
01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:46.319 align:start position:0%
money that would be coming into the
 
01:00:48.069 --> 01:00:48.079 align:start position:0%
state because of snap benefits that's
 
01:00:50.069 --> 01:00:50.079 align:start position:0%
why they can't estimate how much would
 
01:00:51.750 --> 01:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
be received
 
01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
it's the money coming in from the united
 
01:00:56.230 --> 01:00:56.240 align:start position:0%
states department of agriculture i still
 
01:00:58.870 --> 01:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
look at this phrase that says
 
01:01:01.190 --> 01:01:01.200 align:start position:0%
if insufficient federal or private funds
 
01:01:03.270 --> 01:01:03.280 align:start position:0%
i mean i'm not speaking here to the
 
01:01:04.950 --> 01:01:04.960 align:start position:0%
merits of the program itself i'm
 
01:01:07.270 --> 01:01:07.280 align:start position:0%
speaking to assertions about uh who
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
funds it in case
 
01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
well let's
 
01:01:12.789 --> 01:01:12.799 align:start position:0%
i think there's two separate things here
 
01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:14.720 align:start position:0%
one is there's the issue of what it
 
01:01:16.950 --> 01:01:16.960 align:start position:0%
costs to run a program is also the issue
 
01:01:18.870 --> 01:01:18.880 align:start position:0%
about building awareness of the program
 
01:01:20.230 --> 01:01:20.240 align:start position:0%
this is talking about building the
 
01:01:21.829 --> 01:01:21.839 align:start position:0%
awareness of the program when the
 
01:01:24.630 --> 01:01:24.640 align:start position:0%
program may grow because the needs there
 
01:01:26.710 --> 01:01:26.720 align:start position:0%
the cost to run the program as far as
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
the food and so forth is coming the
 
01:01:30.069 --> 01:01:30.079 align:start position:0%
united states department of agriculture
 
01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:32.720 align:start position:0%
not from a state so therefore when you
 
01:01:34.470 --> 01:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
start looking at the cost to run the
 
01:01:36.230 --> 01:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
program that's borne by the federal
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
government the cost to build the
 
01:01:38.950 --> 01:01:38.960 align:start position:0%
awareness of the program is borne by our
 
01:01:40.470 --> 01:01:40.480 align:start position:0%
state which is incorporating the
 
01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:43.920 align:start position:0%
department's budget representative leon
 
01:01:45.670 --> 01:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman when we look at
 
01:01:47.589 --> 01:01:47.599 align:start position:0%
the fiscal note it says the department
 
01:01:49.030 --> 01:01:49.040 align:start position:0%
notes that in its normal course of
 
01:01:51.190 --> 01:01:51.200 align:start position:0%
business it already plans to apply for
 
01:01:53.270 --> 01:01:53.280 align:start position:0%
snap outreach plan as part of its august
 
01:01:55.190 --> 01:01:55.200 align:start position:0%
submission so they're already planning
 
01:01:56.309 --> 01:01:56.319 align:start position:0%
to do this
 
01:01:58.630 --> 01:01:58.640 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't it says that it limits it
 
01:02:00.710 --> 01:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
to only if it's fully funded by private
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
or federal sources but it's allowed to
 
01:02:04.549 --> 01:02:04.559 align:start position:0%
go through the general fund if they're
 
01:02:06.630 --> 01:02:06.640 align:start position:0%
already planning to do this
 
01:02:08.309 --> 01:02:08.319 align:start position:0%
we can let them continue to do that
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
without having to pass this law
 
01:02:12.390 --> 01:02:12.400 align:start position:0%
because the point was to put this into
 
01:02:14.069 --> 01:02:14.079 align:start position:0%
the stat they said that they wanted this
 
01:02:17.430 --> 01:02:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:19.910 --> 01:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
again i go back to when i look at what's
 
01:02:22.470 --> 01:02:22.480 align:start position:0%
going on here representative leon
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
to your point
 
01:02:26.309 --> 01:02:26.319 align:start position:0%
the cost to run the program is coming
 
01:02:27.750 --> 01:02:27.760 align:start position:0%
from the federal government that money
 
01:02:29.270 --> 01:02:29.280 align:start position:0%
goes away for the most part life is
 
01:02:32.789 --> 01:02:32.799 align:start position:0%
going to wait the program today exists
 
01:02:35.270 --> 01:02:35.280 align:start position:0%
does it not yes the programming so
 
01:02:36.390 --> 01:02:36.400 align:start position:0%
therefore all we're trying to do is
 
01:02:38.390 --> 01:02:38.400 align:start position:0%
build awareness of the program
 
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:40.240 align:start position:0%
so if the program already exists all the
 
01:02:41.670 --> 01:02:41.680 align:start position:0%
financial things we're talking about are
 
01:02:43.510 --> 01:02:43.520 align:start position:0%
going to occur regardless
 
01:02:45.029 --> 01:02:45.039 align:start position:0%
all we're doing at this point in time is
 
01:02:46.789 --> 01:02:46.799 align:start position:0%
trying to build more awareness of the
 
01:02:49.109 --> 01:02:49.119 align:start position:0%
program so people can benefit from it
 
01:02:50.870 --> 01:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
but the cost to run the program because
 
01:02:52.630 --> 01:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
it already exists
 
01:02:54.309 --> 01:02:54.319 align:start position:0%
is going to be incurred whether we pass
 
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:00.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:02.630 --> 01:03:02.640 align:start position:0%

bill 408 which directs the department of

freestanding birthing centers under
 
01:06:07.829 --> 01:06:07.839 align:start position:0%
medicaid specifically to make the rate
 
01:06:10.470 --> 01:06:10.480 align:start position:0%
comparable to the hospital rates the
 
01:06:12.390 --> 01:06:12.400 align:start position:0%
facility fee under medicaid for these
 
01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:13.589 align:start position:0%
facility fee under medicaid for these
centers

01:06:13.589 --> 01:06:13.599 align:start position:0%

01:06:20.630 --> 01:06:20.640 align:start position:0%
and from what i can tell
 
01:06:23.270 --> 01:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
there this has not been changed
 
01:06:25.750 --> 01:06:25.760 align:start position:0%
maybe ever or in a number of years
 
01:06:27.829 --> 01:06:27.839 align:start position:0%
we're seeking to raise that rate um
 
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:30.440 align:start position:0%
which is included in the fiscal note to
 
01:06:33.430 --> 01:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
921 dollars again this is under medicaid
 
01:06:35.750 --> 01:06:35.760 align:start position:0%
making a comparable
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
rising this to taking this and raising
 
01:06:40.150 --> 01:06:40.160 align:start position:0%
it up to comp to be comparable with a
 
01:06:42.789 --> 01:06:42.799 align:start position:0%
hospital rate but not parity
 
01:06:45.430 --> 01:06:45.440 align:start position:0%

for taking my question just
 
01:08:18.799 --> 01:08:19.590 align:start position:0%
for taking my question just
for

01:08:19.590 --> 01:08:19.600 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:21.759 align:start position:0%
sort of running on the same uh avenue
 
01:08:23.110 --> 01:08:23.120 align:start position:0%
that we just started with the last
 
01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:26.480 align:start position:0%
question what is comparable in terms of
 
01:08:28.870 --> 01:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
for the same i'm not sure what this
 
01:08:30.950 --> 01:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
dollar amount covers
 
01:08:32.550 --> 01:08:32.560 align:start position:0%
because there's a lot more
 
01:08:35.030 --> 01:08:35.040 align:start position:0%
ivs and medications everything else what
 
01:08:36.470 --> 01:08:36.480 align:start position:0%
does this cover
 
01:08:40.149 --> 01:08:40.159 align:start position:0%
and what is what would be a similar
 
01:08:40.159 --> 01:08:41.430 align:start position:0%
and what is what would be a similar
charge

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
charge
 
01:08:43.669 --> 01:08:43.679 align:start position:0%
if it were private insurance
 
01:08:43.679 --> 01:08:45.030 align:start position:0%
if it were private insurance
um

01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
so we have something to compare it to
 
01:08:48.550 --> 01:08:48.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you for the question so
 
01:08:51.510 --> 01:08:51.520 align:start position:0%
i do have director lipman with me here
 
01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:52.630 align:start position:0%
i do have director lipman with me here
from

01:08:52.630 --> 01:08:52.640 align:start position:0%
from
 
01:08:53.749 --> 01:08:53.759 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
01:08:57.110 --> 01:08:57.120 align:start position:0%
services who would be able to drill down
 
01:08:59.749 --> 01:08:59.759 align:start position:0%
further into this uh but and again this
 
01:09:00.950 --> 01:09:00.960 align:start position:0%
is we're talking about comparable we're
 
01:09:02.709 --> 01:09:02.719 align:start position:0%
not talking about parity we know that
 
01:09:04.470 --> 01:09:04.480 align:start position:0%
the cost to run these freestanding birth
 
01:09:07.189 --> 01:09:07.199 align:start position:0%
descent centers is different than it
 
01:09:08.550 --> 01:09:08.560 align:start position:0%
would be for a hospital and that's why
 
01:09:10.550 --> 01:09:10.560 align:start position:0%
we're not seeking parity here but i can
 
01:09:12.789 --> 01:09:12.799 align:start position:0%
we defer that question to um director
 
01:09:12.799 --> 01:09:14.149 align:start position:0%
we defer that question to um director

01:09:15.669 --> 01:09:15.679 align:start position:0%
the remainder of it
 
01:09:18.309 --> 01:09:18.319 align:start position:0%
representative merchant
 
01:09:19.829 --> 01:09:19.839 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
01:09:21.189 --> 01:09:21.199 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
we had a very long
 
01:09:26.470 --> 01:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
discussion on house bill 1044
 
01:09:28.870 --> 01:09:28.880 align:start position:0%
dealing with market competition
 
01:09:30.950 --> 01:09:30.960 align:start position:0%
and people in this committee voted to
 
01:09:33.510 --> 01:09:33.520 align:start position:0%
increase market competition
 
01:09:35.590 --> 01:09:35.600 align:start position:0%
in essence by having freestanding
 
01:09:37.829 --> 01:09:37.839 align:start position:0%
birthing centers is that not in fact
 
01:09:39.510 --> 01:09:39.520 align:start position:0%
increasing or allowing us to have
 
01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
greater access for patients but also
 
01:09:42.470 --> 01:09:42.480 align:start position:0%
bring market competition to the
 
01:09:42.480 --> 01:09:46.550 align:start position:0%
bring market competition to the
forefront

01:09:46.550 --> 01:09:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:47.910 --> 01:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
representative merchant that's a great
 
01:09:51.590 --> 01:09:51.600 align:start position:0%
question um i think that it it does in a
 
01:09:54.070 --> 01:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
sense bring market competition it offers
 
01:09:56.550 --> 01:09:56.560 align:start position:0%
more choices but i do want to point out
 
01:09:58.229 --> 01:09:58.239 align:start position:0%
that i believe that this
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
complements the health care system
 
01:10:03.750 --> 01:10:03.760 align:start position:0%
nicely i think we're all aware that
 
01:10:06.470 --> 01:10:06.480 align:start position:0%
there are ambulatory care centers
 
01:10:07.669 --> 01:10:07.679 align:start position:0%
that are doing you know their
 
01:10:09.990 --> 01:10:10.000 align:start position:0%
freestanding that are doing surgical
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
procedures some of them affiliated with
 
01:10:13.350 --> 01:10:13.360 align:start position:0%
hospitals some of them
 
01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:14.630 align:start position:0%
hospitals some of them
not

01:10:14.630 --> 01:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:10:16.149 --> 01:10:16.159 align:start position:0%
that have been existing in new hampshire
 
01:10:18.550 --> 01:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
for a number of years so this is very
 
01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:20.159 align:start position:0%
similar along those lines the way that i
 
01:10:21.189 --> 01:10:21.199 align:start position:0%
see it
 
01:10:22.709 --> 01:10:22.719 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you senator
 
01:10:24.310 --> 01:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
representative gay
 
01:10:25.750 --> 01:10:25.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:10:27.590 --> 01:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
thank you very much for
 
01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
bringing such a good sensible bill would
 
01:10:31.350 --> 01:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
you believe
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:45.430 --> 01:10:45.440 align:start position:0%
thank you senator you're welcome the
 
01:10:47.669 --> 01:10:47.679 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes henry lippman and
 
01:10:51.990 --> 01:10:52.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:54.070 --> 01:10:54.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think trisha is here but i think
 
01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
i can hopefully cover the questions
 
01:10:58.709 --> 01:10:58.719 align:start position:0%
i have faith in you thank you she's down
 
01:11:01.030 --> 01:11:01.040 align:start position:0%
in center hhs you're still looking well
 
01:11:03.830 --> 01:11:03.840 align:start position:0%
tanned mr luke
 
01:11:14.229 --> 01:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:15.669 --> 01:11:15.679 align:start position:0%
i guess i can start by answering a
 
01:11:17.590 --> 01:11:17.600 align:start position:0%
couple of questions that were out there
 
01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400 align:start position:0%
um the question in terms of when we did
 
01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:22.960 align:start position:0%
comparable typical average length of
 
01:11:26.070 --> 01:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
stay for birth is like 2.2 days so what
 
01:11:28.310 --> 01:11:28.320 align:start position:0%
we did is we calculated the per diem of
 
01:11:30.630 --> 01:11:30.640 align:start position:0%
the current drg rate
 
01:11:33.510 --> 01:11:33.520 align:start position:0%
the per diem being a day
 
01:11:35.830 --> 01:11:35.840 align:start position:0%
and since most of the birthing centers
 
01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.470 align:start position:0%
and since most of the birthing centers
are

01:11:36.470 --> 01:11:36.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:11:36.480 --> 01:11:37.189 align:start position:0%
are
a

01:11:37.189 --> 01:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:11:37.199 --> 01:11:38.709 align:start position:0%
a
day

01:11:38.709 --> 01:11:38.719 align:start position:0%
day
 
01:11:41.110 --> 01:11:41.120 align:start position:0%
service that's how we came up with with
 
01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:43.189 align:start position:0%
service that's how we came up with with
that

01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:11:46.550 --> 01:11:46.560 align:start position:0%
in terms of um
 
01:11:49.030 --> 01:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
competition and access i think that
 
01:11:52.070 --> 01:11:52.080 align:start position:0%
particularly the facility in swansea
 
01:11:53.990 --> 01:11:54.000 align:start position:0%
you know we have heard concerns about
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
other hospitals
 
01:11:57.830 --> 01:11:57.840 align:start position:0%
um being able to maintain obstetric
 
01:11:59.990 --> 01:12:00.000 align:start position:0%
services one of the areas we're worried
 
01:12:02.149 --> 01:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
about is in that region
 
01:12:03.669 --> 01:12:03.679 align:start position:0%
and i think
 
01:12:03.679 --> 01:12:04.630 align:start position:0%
and i think
the

01:12:04.630 --> 01:12:04.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:12:07.830 --> 01:12:07.840 align:start position:0%
lead constituent i think that approached
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
senator apprentice was from that area i
 
01:12:12.390 --> 01:12:12.400 align:start position:0%
think it's a it's a sensible bill i'm
 
01:12:15.030 --> 01:12:15.040 align:start position:0%
glad to hear that there's support on it
 
01:12:17.270 --> 01:12:17.280 align:start position:0%
um i think we need to
 
01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:19.199 align:start position:0%
you know the obstetric situation the
 
01:12:21.350 --> 01:12:21.360 align:start position:0%
state is very fragile generally and i
 
01:12:23.590 --> 01:12:23.600 align:start position:0%
think preserving this option
 
01:12:25.590 --> 01:12:25.600 align:start position:0%
um you know this is a step i'm not sure
 
01:12:27.830 --> 01:12:27.840 align:start position:0%
it's the final step that we need to take
 
01:12:29.669 --> 01:12:29.679 align:start position:0%
in terms of all the birthing situations
 
01:12:31.990 --> 01:12:32.000 align:start position:0%
in the state but at least it buys us
 
01:12:33.510 --> 01:12:33.520 align:start position:0%
some time so that we're not dealing with
 
01:12:36.470 --> 01:12:36.480 align:start position:0%
a crisis
 
01:12:38.870 --> 01:12:38.880 align:start position:0%
merchant representative merchant thank
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman thank you miss lip for
 
01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:42.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
my understanding is that when you look
 
01:12:45.189 --> 01:12:45.199 align:start position:0%
at the medicaid
 
01:12:47.990 --> 01:12:48.000 align:start position:0%
payment system it's predicated upon an
 
01:12:51.750 --> 01:12:51.760 align:start position:0%
icd-9 code and basically it doesn't
 
01:12:54.070 --> 01:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
matter where that procedure is being
 
01:12:55.910 --> 01:12:55.920 align:start position:0%
operated it's the same rate
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
whether it's done in a hospital than a
 
01:13:00.550 --> 01:13:00.560 align:start position:0%
clinic and so forth based upon parity if
 
01:13:02.870 --> 01:13:02.880 align:start position:0%
you will within the code structure would
 
01:13:04.950 --> 01:13:04.960 align:start position:0%
this not bring greater parity in that
 
01:13:06.950 --> 01:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
regard because we'd have standardization
 
01:13:09.270 --> 01:13:09.280 align:start position:0%
of again the same thing where we have
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
parity between different providers the
 
01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
same procedure
 
01:13:16.070 --> 01:13:16.080 align:start position:0%
i think that um
 
01:13:18.229 --> 01:13:18.239 align:start position:0%
the way i had to do some research on
 
01:13:20.470 --> 01:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
this myself that the birthing centers
 
01:13:22.950 --> 01:13:22.960 align:start position:0%
were set up uh a little bit differently
 
01:13:25.430 --> 01:13:25.440 align:start position:0%
than hospitals in this instance um sort
 
01:13:27.830 --> 01:13:27.840 align:start position:0%
of if you kind of think about it as uh
 
01:13:30.310 --> 01:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
there's not necessarily a facility if he
 
01:13:31.750 --> 01:13:31.760 align:start position:0%
it's a
 
01:13:33.030 --> 01:13:33.040 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:13:34.950 --> 01:13:34.960 align:start position:0%
you know just in terms of trying to come
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
up with something that made
 
01:13:38.950 --> 01:13:38.960 align:start position:0%
some logical sense in terms of
 
01:13:41.270 --> 01:13:41.280 align:start position:0%
benchmarking and against what a hospital
 
01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:43.120 align:start position:0%
incurs and understanding that it's only
 
01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:45.280 align:start position:0%
going to be for a shorter time
 
01:13:47.270 --> 01:13:47.280 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's how we approached
 
01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:54.470 align:start position:0%
i think that's that's how we approached
it

01:13:54.470 --> 01:13:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:13:55.360 --> 01:13:57.350 align:start position:0%
thank you
welcome

chair recognizes james monahan
 
01:14:03.030 --> 01:14:03.040 align:start position:0%
we wrote up here today
 
01:14:04.790 --> 01:14:04.800 align:start position:0%
didn't get much of a chance for a
 
01:14:06.470 --> 01:14:06.480 align:start position:0%
conversation though because it was only
 
01:14:11.430 --> 01:14:11.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:13.270 --> 01:14:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's uh stalling for time he's got
 
01:14:15.669 --> 01:14:15.679 align:start position:0%
handouts there was only one story i'm
 
01:14:15.679 --> 01:14:17.910 align:start position:0%
handouts there was only one story i'm
sorry

01:14:17.910 --> 01:14:17.920 align:start position:0%
sorry
 
01:14:20.070 --> 01:14:20.080 align:start position:0%
what's that
 
01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.350 align:start position:0%
what's that
oh

01:14:21.350 --> 01:14:21.360 align:start position:0%
oh
 
01:14:28.470 --> 01:14:28.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:30.310 --> 01:14:30.320 align:start position:0%
yes and somebody's trying to elevate
 
01:14:32.470 --> 01:14:32.480 align:start position:0%
this to what over there
 
01:14:34.229 --> 01:14:34.239 align:start position:0%
however we all know that what goes up
 
01:14:37.110 --> 01:14:37.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:38.960 align:start position:0%
now you've been here for a few hearings
 
01:14:51.430 --> 01:14:51.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.229 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

01:14:52.229 --> 01:14:52.239 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:14:53.590 --> 01:14:53.600 align:start position:0%
thank you mr

chairman um
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
so as you observe my name is uh jim
 
01:14:59.590 --> 01:14:59.600 align:start position:0%
monahan i'm with the uh dupont group and
 
01:15:01.669 --> 01:15:01.679 align:start position:0%
just one second we're we're don't all
 
01:15:04.149 --> 01:15:04.159 align:start position:0%
have the kind of the 24 that it
 
01:15:05.430 --> 01:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
passed out if they would make it right
 
01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:08.310 align:start position:0%
okay somebody's got two

01:15:23.510 --> 01:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:31.189 --> 01:15:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:33.430 --> 01:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
you may proceed though great sir thank
 
01:15:34.870 --> 01:15:34.880 align:start position:0%
you uh mr chairman my name is jim
 
01:15:36.550 --> 01:15:36.560 align:start position:0%
monahan i'm with the dupont group and we
 
01:15:37.990 --> 01:15:38.000 align:start position:0%
volunteer some of our time with the new
 
01:15:39.910 --> 01:15:39.920 align:start position:0%
hampshire midwives association so i'm
 
01:15:42.229 --> 01:15:42.239 align:start position:0%
happy to be working with the legislature
 
01:15:43.669 --> 01:15:43.679 align:start position:0%
and the department on this bill this
 
01:15:47.350 --> 01:15:47.360 align:start position:0%
year um mary lowey from the um
 
01:15:48.950 --> 01:15:48.960 align:start position:0%
midwives association had hoped to be
 
01:15:50.950 --> 01:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
here today but wasn't able to make it
 
01:15:52.470 --> 01:15:52.480 align:start position:0%
and so the letter that i presented is
 
01:15:54.790 --> 01:15:54.800 align:start position:0%
really from her um i don't have a lot to
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
add uh and when i heard representative
 
01:15:58.950 --> 01:15:58.960 align:start position:0%
gay say you like it almost said maybe i
 
01:16:00.229 --> 01:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
shouldn't testify
 
01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
but um
 
01:16:04.229 --> 01:16:04.239 align:start position:0%
um but just to add you know the the
 
01:16:06.229 --> 01:16:06.239 align:start position:0%
letter from uh mary does offer some
 
01:16:07.910 --> 01:16:07.920 align:start position:0%
observations about how the medicaid
 
01:16:09.510 --> 01:16:09.520 align:start position:0%
reimbursement for the birthing sentence
 
01:16:11.510 --> 01:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
is is remarkably low
 
01:16:13.750 --> 01:16:13.760 align:start position:0%
um and so when we began working in this
 
01:16:15.830 --> 01:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
issue with the department we very much
 
01:16:17.350 --> 01:16:17.360 align:start position:0%
did not want to come in and say it has
 
01:16:20.070 --> 01:16:20.080 align:start position:0%
to be exactly the same as hospitals and
 
01:16:21.430 --> 01:16:21.440 align:start position:0%
that's why we came to the conclusion
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
that a comparable rate which would take
 
01:16:25.750 --> 01:16:25.760 align:start position:0%
into account the differential facilities
 
01:16:27.750 --> 01:16:27.760 align:start position:0%
costs as representative woods observed
 
01:16:30.310 --> 01:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
would be the best way to do it
 
01:16:31.669 --> 01:16:31.679 align:start position:0%
but the department felt that the
 
01:16:33.430 --> 01:16:33.440 align:start position:0%
direction from the legislature undertake
 
01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:35.120 align:start position:0%
the rulemaking was necessary and that's
 
01:16:36.709 --> 01:16:36.719 align:start position:0%
what brings us here today
 
01:16:39.189 --> 01:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
uh you will see that the uh and mary's
 
01:16:41.510 --> 01:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
letter that they estimate the facilities
 
01:16:42.870 --> 01:16:42.880 align:start position:0%
costs are really probably closer to
 
01:16:45.270 --> 01:16:45.280 align:start position:0%
three thousand dollars
 
01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:47.280 align:start position:0%
and what we're asking for is very modest
 
01:16:49.910 --> 01:16:49.920 align:start position:0%
increase in the rate and a big part of
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
that is to try to ensure that the
 
01:16:52.950 --> 01:16:52.960 align:start position:0%
birthing centers
 
01:16:55.350 --> 01:16:55.360 align:start position:0%
can continue to care for
 
01:16:58.149 --> 01:16:58.159 align:start position:0%
medicaid families at time of birth and
 
01:17:01.350 --> 01:17:01.360 align:start position:0%
not have such a perverse negative
 
01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:02.470 align:start position:0%
not have such a perverse negative
incentive

01:17:02.470 --> 01:17:02.480 align:start position:0%
incentive
 
01:17:05.270 --> 01:17:05.280 align:start position:0%
to do so i think ultimately what
 
01:17:07.510 --> 01:17:07.520 align:start position:0%
we hope to see moving forward uh is in
 
01:17:09.510 --> 01:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
those areas that are underserved that we
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
create the right market signals for
 
01:17:13.110 --> 01:17:13.120 align:start position:0%
birthing centers to open in the north
 
01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:14.640 align:start position:0%
country and more rural parts of the
 
01:17:16.550 --> 01:17:16.560 align:start position:0%
state so i'll do my best to answer any
 
01:17:18.149 --> 01:17:18.159 align:start position:0%
questions you might have if i'm unable
 
01:17:20.950 --> 01:17:20.960 align:start position:0%
to i can communicate with mary lower and
 
01:17:24.870 --> 01:17:24.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:27.040 align:start position:0%
if we have an extra copy of this i i
 
01:17:29.110 --> 01:17:29.120 align:start position:0%
think representative cushman should
 
01:17:31.110 --> 01:17:31.120 align:start position:0%
probably get it huh
 
01:17:32.390 --> 01:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it
 
01:17:34.550 --> 01:17:34.560 align:start position:0%
i'll leave it for her
 
01:17:35.910 --> 01:17:35.920 align:start position:0%
she may need it
 
01:17:41.750 --> 01:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:43.669 --> 01:17:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman
 
01:17:48.630 --> 01:17:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
i'm just curious to know do do you have
 
01:17:53.350 --> 01:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
numbers of the
 
01:17:56.070 --> 01:17:56.080 align:start position:0%
population who are taking advantage of
 
01:18:00.229 --> 01:18:00.239 align:start position:0%
or or utilizing uh the medicaid programs
 
01:18:02.950 --> 01:18:02.960 align:start position:0%
in these freestanding uh yeah it's not a
 
01:18:06.149 --> 01:18:06.159 align:start position:0%
huge number um i think um
 
01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:07.840 align:start position:0%
from the data we've seen i apologize not
 
01:18:09.270 --> 01:18:09.280 align:start position:0%
having with me that i think there were
 
01:18:11.910 --> 01:18:11.920 align:start position:0%
68 uh births at birthing centers from
 
01:18:14.390 --> 01:18:14.400 align:start position:0%
medicaid families uh last year uh that
 
01:18:16.390 --> 01:18:16.400 align:start position:0%
was slightly higher because of the
 
01:18:18.709 --> 01:18:18.719 align:start position:0%
pandemic i think people were
 
01:18:20.630 --> 01:18:20.640 align:start position:0%
more perhaps more reluctant to be in
 
01:18:22.790 --> 01:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals um and so
 
01:18:24.470 --> 01:18:24.480 align:start position:0%
um i think with the fiscal note is on
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
average we're probably looking for at
 
01:18:28.070 --> 01:18:28.080 align:start position:0%
least with the five centers there now uh
 
01:18:31.350 --> 01:18:31.360 align:start position:0%
50 medicaid births a year
 
01:18:33.189 --> 01:18:33.199 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:18:36.149 --> 01:18:36.159 align:start position:0%
and i think that compares to 3 500
 
01:18:38.149 --> 01:18:38.159 align:start position:0%
um for hospital births
 
01:18:41.270 --> 01:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
representative knurk uh yes and just in
 
01:18:43.430 --> 01:18:43.440 align:start position:0%
terms of the responsibility of the
 
01:18:44.870 --> 01:18:44.880 align:start position:0%
birthing centers
 
01:18:48.630 --> 01:18:48.640 align:start position:0%
um they are required under 151 2f to
 
01:18:50.149 --> 01:18:50.159 align:start position:0%
accept all payers
 
01:18:53.430 --> 01:18:53.440 align:start position:0%
so indeed them doing this
 
01:18:54.870 --> 01:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
it does have a negative impact if
 
01:18:56.070 --> 01:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
they're not getting reimbursed a
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
reasonable amount correct yes is that
 
01:18:59.830 --> 01:18:59.840 align:start position:0%
right would you believe or i should say
 
01:19:02.630 --> 01:19:02.640 align:start position:0%
is that correct thank you
 
01:19:04.709 --> 01:19:04.719 align:start position:0%
representative leon um thank you mr
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you for taking the
 
01:19:07.270 --> 01:19:07.280 align:start position:0%
question if you're not the right person
 
01:19:09.270 --> 01:19:09.280 align:start position:0%
to ask you can let me know okay um i was
 
01:19:11.189 --> 01:19:11.199 align:start position:0%
curious if you know how many births
 
01:19:12.870 --> 01:19:12.880 align:start position:0%
happen in these freestanding birthing
 
01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:14.320 align:start position:0%
centers um
 
01:19:15.830 --> 01:19:15.840 align:start position:0%
in general not just the medicaid
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
reversed ones i'll get that answer to
 
01:19:20.550 --> 01:19:20.560 align:start position:0%
you um so okay um
 
01:19:21.990 --> 01:19:22.000 align:start position:0%
thank you i'm curious i don't want to
 
01:19:23.750 --> 01:19:23.760 align:start position:0%
make this mistake of guessing but we can
 
01:19:33.189 --> 01:19:33.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:39.910 --> 01:19:39.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.750 --> 01:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
did she just ask that it's like 3 500
 
01:19:46.229 --> 01:19:46.239 align:start position:0%
hospital births in the year or were you
 
01:19:49.030 --> 01:19:49.040 align:start position:0%
talking about 3 500 births at the
 
01:19:51.510 --> 01:19:51.520 align:start position:0%
birthing centers
 
01:19:53.270 --> 01:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
that was me my observation was i think
 
01:19:55.350 --> 01:19:55.360 align:start position:0%
there's 3 500 medicaid births in
 
01:19:58.470 --> 01:19:58.480 align:start position:0%
hospitals per year as opposed to only 50
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
at the birthing centers but
 
01:20:02.390 --> 01:20:02.400 align:start position:0%
representative leon's question was
 
01:20:03.910 --> 01:20:03.920 align:start position:0%
which i didn't have the answer to which
 
01:20:05.669 --> 01:20:05.679 align:start position:0%
is what are the total number of births
 
01:20:06.790 --> 01:20:06.800 align:start position:0%
that have taken place at the five
 
01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:08.480 align:start position:0%
birthing centers on the annual basis and
 
01:20:20.629 --> 01:20:20.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:23.990 --> 01:20:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:25.590 --> 01:20:25.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
01:20:26.870 --> 01:20:26.880 align:start position:0%
and also thank you for taking my
 
01:20:26.880 --> 01:20:28.229 align:start position:0%
and also thank you for taking my
question

01:20:28.229 --> 01:20:28.239 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:20:29.590 --> 01:20:29.600 align:start position:0%
in the letter
 
01:20:31.350 --> 01:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
thank you for providing this to us from
 
01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:34.080 align:start position:0%
mary waller
 
01:20:36.149 --> 01:20:36.159 align:start position:0%
she made a comment it's
 
01:20:37.990 --> 01:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
not just the economics here but if you
 
01:20:40.229 --> 01:20:40.239 align:start position:0%
look in the third paragraph on her
 
01:20:40.239 --> 01:20:41.830 align:start position:0%
look in the third paragraph on her
letter

01:20:41.830 --> 01:20:41.840 align:start position:0%
letter
 
01:20:44.229 --> 01:20:44.239 align:start position:0%
it talks about this strong starting
 
01:20:45.750 --> 01:20:45.760 align:start position:0%
shift for mothers and newborns for the
 
01:20:47.189 --> 01:20:47.199 align:start position:0%
centers of medicare and medicaid
 
01:20:48.310 --> 01:20:48.320 align:start position:0%
reported that
 
01:20:50.470 --> 01:20:50.480 align:start position:0%
women who received care participating
 
01:20:52.149 --> 01:20:52.159 align:start position:0%
birthing centers had fewer preterm
 
01:20:53.270 --> 01:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
births lower
 
01:20:55.669 --> 01:20:55.679 align:start position:0%
low birth weight babies and caesarean
 
01:20:55.679 --> 01:20:56.790 align:start position:0%
low birth weight babies and caesarean
sections

01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:56.800 align:start position:0%
sections
 
01:20:59.669 --> 01:20:59.679 align:start position:0%
so therefore economically speaking is
 
01:21:01.669 --> 01:21:01.679 align:start position:0%
this not a positive thing because
 
01:21:03.750 --> 01:21:03.760 align:start position:0%
in a lot of ways having
 
01:21:06.870 --> 01:21:06.880 align:start position:0%
patients that receive that kind of care
 
01:21:08.629 --> 01:21:08.639 align:start position:0%
are incurring less cost to the health
 
01:21:11.110 --> 01:21:11.120 align:start position:0%
care system than if they would otherwise
 
01:21:12.550 --> 01:21:12.560 align:start position:0%
so this is really kind of an economic
 
01:21:13.750 --> 01:21:13.760 align:start position:0%
would you agree with the fact that it's
 
01:21:15.350 --> 01:21:15.360 align:start position:0%
not just the question of
 
01:21:17.990 --> 01:21:18.000 align:start position:0%
access and the ability to be taken care
 
01:21:19.910 --> 01:21:19.920 align:start position:0%
of but from an economic point of view
 
01:21:21.910 --> 01:21:21.920 align:start position:0%
overall care for the
 
01:21:23.830 --> 01:21:23.840 align:start position:0%
mother who's having a child is less
 
01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:24.950 align:start position:0%
mother who's having a child is less
costly

01:21:24.950 --> 01:21:24.960 align:start position:0%
costly
 
01:21:26.550 --> 01:21:26.560 align:start position:0%
uh yes i'd agree with that and that's
 
01:21:26.560 --> 01:21:27.350 align:start position:0%
uh yes i'd agree with that and that's
why

01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
why
 
01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:29.840 align:start position:0%
you know as we elevated this history we
 
01:21:31.350 --> 01:21:31.360 align:start position:0%
certainly heard from the payer community
 
01:21:32.709 --> 01:21:32.719 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to be supportive as
 
01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:35.040 align:start position:0%
well because they they want to have that
 
01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:37.040 align:start position:0%
less costly option
 
01:21:38.390 --> 01:21:38.400 align:start position:0%
i suspect that
 
01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:39.189 align:start position:0%
i suspect that
well

01:21:39.189 --> 01:21:39.199 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:21:41.350 --> 01:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
not to error literalize too much i'm
 
01:21:42.790 --> 01:21:42.800 align:start position:0%
when a family chooses a birthing center
 
01:21:44.070 --> 01:21:44.080 align:start position:0%
i don't think it's necessarily an
 
01:21:45.990 --> 01:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
economic decision
 
01:21:47.669 --> 01:21:47.679 align:start position:0%
maybe in part but there are other
 
01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:51.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:52.719 align:start position:0%
follow up
 
01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:21:55.189 --> 01:21:55.199 align:start position:0%
i totally agree i don't think it's
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
economics what drives the decision but i
 
01:21:59.350 --> 01:21:59.360 align:start position:0%
think from us evaluating this bill and
 
01:22:01.110 --> 01:22:01.120 align:start position:0%
the merits to it there's not just the
 
01:22:02.950 --> 01:22:02.960 align:start position:0%
access question but also the economic
 
01:22:06.070 --> 01:22:06.080 align:start position:0%
side of the equation so economically
 
01:22:07.830 --> 01:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
supporting this bill helps us
 
01:22:10.229 --> 01:22:10.239 align:start position:0%
financially at the same time helping if
 
01:22:12.790 --> 01:22:12.800 align:start position:0%
you will those making the wise choice i
 
01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:18.149 --> 01:22:18.159 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
01:22:19.510 --> 01:22:19.520 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chair and thanks for
 
01:22:22.229 --> 01:22:22.239 align:start position:0%
taking my question uh so
 
01:22:24.310 --> 01:22:24.320 align:start position:0%
this small increase would help with the
 
01:22:24.320 --> 01:22:25.750 align:start position:0%
this small increase would help with the
viability

01:22:25.750 --> 01:22:25.760 align:start position:0%
viability
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
um and if i understand it correctly
 
01:22:30.310 --> 01:22:30.320 align:start position:0%
this would also help
 
01:22:32.790 --> 01:22:32.800 align:start position:0%
them with the prenatal and postnatal
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
services that they provide at the center
 
01:22:37.669 --> 01:22:37.679 align:start position:0%
is that correct
 
01:22:40.310 --> 01:22:40.320 align:start position:0%
uh subject to director lippmann nodding
 
01:22:41.669 --> 01:22:41.679 align:start position:0%
one way or the other i think mostly what
 
01:22:44.709 --> 01:22:44.719 align:start position:0%
focused on here is the facility charge
 
01:22:46.870 --> 01:22:46.880 align:start position:0%
uh and not the other associated charges
 
01:22:49.270 --> 01:22:49.280 align:start position:0%
with uh with the births i guess
 
01:22:50.950 --> 01:22:50.960 align:start position:0%
i guess but
 
01:22:52.790 --> 01:22:52.800 align:start position:0%
that's part of the picture for them to
 
01:22:54.629 --> 01:22:54.639 align:start position:0%
be viable
 
01:22:56.390 --> 01:22:56.400 align:start position:0%
yes and if they're not viable then they
 
01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.110 align:start position:0%
yes and if they're not viable then they
would

01:22:57.110 --> 01:22:57.120 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:22:59.750 --> 01:22:59.760 align:start position:0%
then subsequently not be able to offer
 
01:23:01.669 --> 01:23:01.679 align:start position:0%
the other services as well that is
 
01:23:01.679 --> 01:23:09.110 align:start position:0%
the other services as well that is
correct

01:23:09.110 --> 01:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.030 --> 01:23:11.040 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions uh thank you
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:17.830 --> 01:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
okay i'll just i'll get it
 
01:23:19.430 --> 01:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
so i'm sorry
 
01:23:21.189 --> 01:23:21.199 align:start position:0%
senator princess is
 
01:23:22.390 --> 01:23:22.400 align:start position:0%
right on top of things and getting an
 
01:23:23.750 --> 01:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
answer to her i think representing this
 
01:23:25.510 --> 01:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
question but i i didn't want to
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
read it but anyway please before the day
 
01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:28.880 align:start position:0%
is over perhaps we'll get you an answer
 
01:23:32.310 --> 01:23:32.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:32.320 --> 01:23:33.189 align:start position:0%
 
okay

okay
 
01:23:41.110 --> 01:23:41.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:42.390 --> 01:23:42.400 align:start position:0%
having no
 
01:23:44.790 --> 01:23:44.800 align:start position:0%
having no further pink cards
 
01:23:47.910 --> 01:23:47.920 align:start position:0%
the chair assigns uh the duties of
 
01:23:51.910 --> 01:23:51.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.270 align:start position:0%
 
kelsey

01:23:53.270 --> 01:23:53.280 align:start position:0%

thank you and you have joint custody of
 
01:24:08.070 --> 01:24:08.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:10.550 --> 01:24:10.560 align:start position:0%
close the hearing on
 
01:24:12.390 --> 01:24:12.400 align:start position:0%

408. and open the exact session on the
same

01:24:20.390 --> 01:24:20.400 align:start position:0%
same
 
01:24:23.590 --> 01:24:23.600 align:start position:0%
and the chair recognizes representative
 
01:24:26.390 --> 01:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
folsom for
 
01:24:27.590 --> 01:24:27.600 align:start position:0%
a motion
 
01:24:31.629 --> 01:24:31.639 align:start position:0%
i move ought to pass on senate bill
 
01:24:31.639 --> 01:24:33.270 align:start position:0%
i move ought to pass on senate bill
408

01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:43.189 align:start position:0%
 
discussion

01:24:43.189 --> 01:24:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:45.430 --> 01:24:45.440 align:start position:0%
representative leon uh thank you mr
 
01:24:46.870 --> 01:24:46.880 align:start position:0%
chairman i think that this is a
 
01:24:48.870 --> 01:24:48.880 align:start position:0%
fantastic bill i think that we need to
 
01:24:51.510 --> 01:24:51.520 align:start position:0%
support a whole spectrum of birthing
 
01:24:53.350 --> 01:24:53.360 align:start position:0%
options to support different families
 
01:24:55.750 --> 01:24:55.760 align:start position:0%
different choices and especially allow
 
01:24:57.669 --> 01:24:57.679 align:start position:0%
some of these lower risk births to
 
01:24:57.679 --> 01:24:58.870 align:start position:0%
some of these lower risk births to
happen

01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:00.560 align:start position:0%
in a different place so that those who
 
01:25:02.149 --> 01:25:02.159 align:start position:0%
need the more intensive management and
 
01:25:04.310 --> 01:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
care in a hospital setting are able to
 
01:25:06.629 --> 01:25:06.639 align:start position:0%
get in there and able to spend that time
 
01:25:09.270 --> 01:25:09.280 align:start position:0%
with those specialists and i like that
 
01:25:11.669 --> 01:25:11.679 align:start position:0%
we're embracing the midwifery standard
 
01:25:13.669 --> 01:25:13.679 align:start position:0%
of care and i'm very happy to vote for
 
01:25:15.990 --> 01:25:16.000 align:start position:0%
this bill representative
 
01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:17.990 align:start position:0%
this bill representative
folsom

01:25:17.990 --> 01:25:18.000 align:start position:0%
folsom
 
01:25:20.310 --> 01:25:20.320 align:start position:0%
i love birthing centers
 
01:25:26.070 --> 01:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:25:28.229 --> 01:25:28.239 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
01:25:31.189 --> 01:25:31.199 align:start position:0%
uh yes um i i'm very much in favor of
 
01:25:33.270 --> 01:25:33.280 align:start position:0%
this uh just from my own practice it's
 
01:25:33.280 --> 01:25:34.390 align:start position:0%
this uh just from my own practice it's
experience

01:25:34.390 --> 01:25:34.400 align:start position:0%
experience
 
01:25:36.709 --> 01:25:36.719 align:start position:0%
in our office uh we looked at the
 
01:25:39.590 --> 01:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
numbers and on across the board for our
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
orthopedic services we got 25 cents on
 
01:25:43.030 --> 01:25:43.040 align:start position:0%
the dollar
 
01:25:45.270 --> 01:25:45.280 align:start position:0%
on average compared on the average
 
01:25:47.750 --> 01:25:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's not considering high or low but
 
01:25:49.590 --> 01:25:49.600 align:start position:0%
on average you've got 25 cents on a
 
01:25:49.600 --> 01:25:51.669 align:start position:0%
on average you've got 25 cents on a
dollar

01:25:51.669 --> 01:25:51.679 align:start position:0%
dollar
 
01:25:54.390 --> 01:25:54.400 align:start position:0%
for any service compared to what we
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
would get with uh standard insurance
 
01:26:00.229 --> 01:26:00.239 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
01:26:02.229 --> 01:26:02.239 align:start position:0%
thank you very much i fully support this
 
01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
but i did want to point out because i
 
01:26:04.709 --> 01:26:04.719 align:start position:0%
think you all know i'm a bit of a
 
01:26:06.390 --> 01:26:06.400 align:start position:0%
stickler for science
 
01:26:08.470 --> 01:26:08.480 align:start position:0%
in the third option sorry the third
 
01:26:10.709 --> 01:26:10.719 align:start position:0%
paragraph of the letter when it talks
 
01:26:12.629 --> 01:26:12.639 align:start position:0%
about the decreased cost for birthing
 
01:26:14.629 --> 01:26:14.639 align:start position:0%
centers which makes it sound like it's
 
01:26:16.390 --> 01:26:16.400 align:start position:0%
really much much more efficient do
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
remember that this is not
 
01:26:21.830 --> 01:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
equal or they're not equivalent uh
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
study populations because there's a
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
pre-selection people with
 
01:26:28.070 --> 01:26:28.080 align:start position:0%
known complicated births uh who are
 
01:26:30.709 --> 01:26:30.719 align:start position:0%
expecting difficult births older any
 
01:26:31.830 --> 01:26:31.840 align:start position:0%
kind of things they're not going to be
 
01:26:33.030 --> 01:26:33.040 align:start position:0%
going to a birthing center they'll be
 
01:26:35.270 --> 01:26:35.280 align:start position:0%
directed to a hospital so
 
01:26:37.189 --> 01:26:37.199 align:start position:0%
though this sounds like it's incredibly
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
more efficient it's not as efficient but
 
01:26:40.709 --> 01:26:40.719 align:start position:0%
i still think this is the right thing
 
01:26:42.229 --> 01:26:42.239 align:start position:0%
and it will probably
 
01:26:44.390 --> 01:26:44.400 align:start position:0%
it is i think
 
01:26:46.550 --> 01:26:46.560 align:start position:0%
representative leon said unload the
 
01:26:48.790 --> 01:26:48.800 align:start position:0%
hospitals of the more routine cases and
 
01:26:50.629 --> 01:26:50.639 align:start position:0%
provide people options so it's a good
 
01:26:50.639 --> 01:26:51.510 align:start position:0%
provide people options so it's a good
bill

01:26:51.510 --> 01:26:51.520 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:26:53.510 --> 01:26:53.520 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
01:26:55.520 --> 01:26:56.390 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
i

01:26:56.390 --> 01:26:56.400 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:26:58.709 --> 01:26:58.719 align:start position:0%
do support this bill and i will vote for
 
01:27:02.229 --> 01:27:02.239 align:start position:0%
it but my initial reaction was that
 
01:27:05.270 --> 01:27:05.280 align:start position:0%
medicaid rates are
 
01:27:05.280 --> 01:27:06.229 align:start position:0%
medicaid rates are
really

01:27:06.229 --> 01:27:06.239 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:09.440 align:start position:0%
low for many many things and um as a
 
01:27:11.350 --> 01:27:11.360 align:start position:0%
board member of a local community mental
 
01:27:14.790 --> 01:27:14.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
medicaid rates are um
 
01:27:20.790 --> 01:27:20.800 align:start position:0%
to a great extent responsible for the
 
01:27:23.189 --> 01:27:23.199 align:start position:0%
fact that we can't find uh staff at our
 
01:27:25.270 --> 01:27:25.280 align:start position:0%
mental health center um and mental
 
01:27:27.669 --> 01:27:27.679 align:start position:0%
health centers all over the state so um
 
01:27:29.990 --> 01:27:30.000 align:start position:0%
i do support this i think the um
 
01:27:33.030 --> 01:27:33.040 align:start position:0%
availability of
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
places to give birth around the state is
 
01:27:37.110 --> 01:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
a particularly vulnerable service but i
 
01:27:38.950 --> 01:27:38.960 align:start position:0%
hope that we will come back here next
 
01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:41.199 align:start position:0%
year and be
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
generous also with the
 
01:27:46.709 --> 01:27:46.719 align:start position:0%
need to rate med to raise medicaid rates
 
01:27:48.629 --> 01:27:48.639 align:start position:0%
for um
 
01:27:52.550 --> 01:27:52.560 align:start position:0%
either across the board or for other
 
01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.229 align:start position:0%
either across the board or for other
um

01:27:54.229 --> 01:27:54.239 align:start position:0%
um

approved 17 to 3.
 
01:31:00.229 --> 01:31:00.239 align:start position:0%

01:31:03.189 --> 01:31:03.199 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative leon for a
 
01:31:03.199 --> 01:31:05.030 align:start position:0%
recognizes representative leon for a
motion

01:31:05.030 --> 01:31:05.040 align:start position:0%
motion
 
01:31:08.070 --> 01:31:08.080 align:start position:0%
um thank you mr chairman i move interim
 
01:31:09.510 --> 01:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
study because the department's already
 
01:31:11.030 --> 01:31:11.040 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
01:31:14.149 --> 01:31:14.159 align:start position:0%
do we have a second representative
 
01:31:18.310 --> 01:31:18.320 align:start position:0%
cofault seconds it now discussion
 
01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman in the fiscal note
 
01:31:21.990 --> 01:31:22.000 align:start position:0%
it states that the department is already
 
01:31:24.070 --> 01:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
planning to do that for that reason i
 
01:31:25.510 --> 01:31:25.520 align:start position:0%
think that
 
01:31:27.830 --> 01:31:27.840 align:start position:0%
keeping our laws short and sweet we
 
01:31:29.110 --> 01:31:29.120 align:start position:0%
allow them to continue to do what
 
01:31:30.870 --> 01:31:30.880 align:start position:0%
they're planning to do put in an interim
 
01:31:33.910 --> 01:31:33.920 align:start position:0%
study so that they know that
 
01:31:35.510 --> 01:31:35.520 align:start position:0%
just put in an interim study and move
 
01:31:39.189 --> 01:31:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:44.310 --> 01:31:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:46.629 --> 01:31:46.639 align:start position:0%
representative soloway
 
01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:49.280 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman it's cheap
 
01:31:51.510 --> 01:31:51.520 align:start position:0%
it sends a message it's compassionate
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
it's easy to do costs us nothing i think
 
01:31:58.390 --> 01:31:58.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.470 --> 01:32:00.480 align:start position:0%
representative canark
 
01:32:01.750 --> 01:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
yes i think one of the other things that
 
01:32:04.149 --> 01:32:04.159 align:start position:0%
came up during the hearing was that this
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
um although they
 
01:32:07.510 --> 01:32:07.520 align:start position:0%
are sort of probably going to be working
 
01:32:09.910 --> 01:32:09.920 align:start position:0%
on it that's a sort of problem maybe and
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
this puts a prod to say we want you to
 
01:32:16.229 --> 01:32:16.239 align:start position:0%
uh which i think tells us
 
01:32:17.830 --> 01:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
sends a message that we'd like them to
 
01:32:19.990 --> 01:32:20.000 align:start position:0%
actually do this and not just maybe do
 
01:32:21.510 --> 01:32:21.520 align:start position:0%
it but maybe sweep it under the rug if
 
01:32:23.590 --> 01:32:23.600 align:start position:0%
they don't get around to it
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
01:32:28.070 --> 01:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman that's
 
01:32:29.910 --> 01:32:29.920 align:start position:0%
that same point is why i moved to
 
01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:31.760 align:start position:0%
interim study because they said that
 
01:32:33.270 --> 01:32:33.280 align:start position:0%
they're already going to do it this is
 
01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
encouragement for them to go ahead and
 
01:32:36.790 --> 01:32:36.800 align:start position:0%
continue on that path without having to
 
01:32:38.790 --> 01:32:38.800 align:start position:0%
put it into law we could start a group
 
01:32:45.030 --> 01:32:45.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:48.149 --> 01:32:48.159 align:start position:0%
anyone else representative merchant
 
01:32:49.910 --> 01:32:49.920 align:start position:0%

01:32:55.830 --> 01:32:55.840 align:start position:0%

and being truly a
 
01:33:02.629 --> 01:33:02.639 align:start position:0%
bipartisan group
 
01:33:04.470 --> 01:33:04.480 align:start position:0%
when you look at page seven
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
this is kind of what i'm trying to get
 
01:33:08.550 --> 01:33:08.560 align:start position:0%
to i think with of us as well
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
on page seven if you look at the snap
 
01:33:11.990 --> 01:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
program enrollment as percent of the
 
01:33:14.390 --> 01:33:14.400 align:start position:0%

in trying to close that gap
 
01:33:39.750 --> 01:33:39.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:39.760 --> 01:33:40.870 align:start position:0%

i come to the table on on this issue as
 
01:34:16.790 --> 01:34:16.800 align:start position:0%
one who um from this committee we did a
 
01:34:19.030 --> 01:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
tremendous amount of work
 
01:34:21.350 --> 01:34:21.360 align:start position:0%
years ago regarding the
 
01:34:24.709 --> 01:34:24.719 align:start position:0%
program it's the snap program itself
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
and the
 
01:34:28.310 --> 01:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
on the ground use of the program that
 
01:34:30.870 --> 01:34:30.880 align:start position:0%
was being at the time
 
01:34:30.880 --> 01:34:31.830 align:start position:0%
was being at the time
uh

uh
 
01:34:34.950 --> 01:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
disparaged that it was being abused
 
01:34:37.990 --> 01:34:38.000 align:start position:0%
ripped off at stores etc etc and uh that
 
01:34:40.550 --> 01:34:40.560 align:start position:0%
the folks and families
 
01:34:41.990 --> 01:34:42.000 align:start position:0%
utilizing it
 
01:34:44.790 --> 01:34:44.800 align:start position:0%
were not qualified to use it
 
01:34:45.910 --> 01:34:45.920 align:start position:0%
i happen to be the chair of the
 
01:34:48.149 --> 01:34:48.159 align:start position:0%
committee that did the oversight on this
 
01:34:51.350 --> 01:34:51.360 align:start position:0%

01:34:51.360 --> 01:34:52.310 align:start position:0%
and what we found that the facts put by
those

01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:34:55.109 --> 01:34:55.119 align:start position:0%
who brought the bill to the table to
 
01:34:58.310 --> 01:34:58.320 align:start position:0%
frankly take snap off the table
 
01:35:00.870 --> 01:35:00.880 align:start position:0%
were incorrect and not only incorrect it
 
01:35:02.470 --> 01:35:02.480 align:start position:0%
was fake
 
01:35:05.030 --> 01:35:05.040 align:start position:0%
what was fake was when in doubt people
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
made things up
 
01:35:09.109 --> 01:35:09.119 align:start position:0%
and when the data was reviewed
 
01:35:10.790 --> 01:35:10.800 align:start position:0%
it was found that less than one tenth of
 
01:35:12.709 --> 01:35:12.719 align:start position:0%
one percent had issues and that was
 
01:35:16.149 --> 01:35:16.159 align:start position:0%
dealing with when you're in a store
 
01:35:18.470 --> 01:35:18.480 align:start position:0%
could you purchase
 
01:35:18.480 --> 01:35:19.990 align:start position:0%
could you purchase
pre-made

01:35:19.990 --> 01:35:20.000 align:start position:0%
pre-made
 
01:35:22.310 --> 01:35:22.320 align:start position:0%
food think of a chicken the answer was
 
01:35:22.320 --> 01:35:23.270 align:start position:0%
food think of a chicken the answer was
no

01:35:23.270 --> 01:35:23.280 align:start position:0%
no
 
01:35:25.430 --> 01:35:25.440 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to have the
 
01:35:27.750 --> 01:35:27.760 align:start position:0%
and still the case today
 
01:35:30.470 --> 01:35:30.480 align:start position:0%
you're supposed to have it for your home
 
01:35:32.390 --> 01:35:32.400 align:start position:0%
to take care of your family and your
 
01:35:34.790 --> 01:35:34.800 align:start position:0%
children and not using it
 
01:35:37.270 --> 01:35:37.280 align:start position:0%
uh for trade just outside
 
01:35:39.270 --> 01:35:39.280 align:start position:0%
the door and that's when those drug use
 
01:35:40.709 --> 01:35:40.719 align:start position:0%
issues played a role in that discussion
 
01:35:40.719 --> 01:35:42.709 align:start position:0%
issues played a role in that discussion
etc

01:35:42.709 --> 01:35:42.719 align:start position:0%
etc
 
01:35:45.990 --> 01:35:46.000 align:start position:0%
what we just supported here
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
was in 408
 
01:35:54.629 --> 01:35:54.639 align:start position:0%
was the genesis of families human beings
 
01:35:56.390 --> 01:35:56.400 align:start position:0%
and stating that we want to make it cost
 
01:35:58.629 --> 01:35:58.639 align:start position:0%
effective that the best health care will
 
01:36:02.149 --> 01:36:02.159 align:start position:0%
provide the best result during birth
 
01:36:04.709 --> 01:36:04.719 align:start position:0%
well now that we have that sustainable
 
01:36:04.719 --> 01:36:05.990 align:start position:0%
well now that we have that sustainable
support

01:36:05.990 --> 01:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:36:08.870 --> 01:36:08.880 align:start position:0%
we now need to sustain the result of
 
01:36:11.990 --> 01:36:12.000 align:start position:0%
that effort in my view and based on the
 
01:36:13.830 --> 01:36:13.840 align:start position:0%
years on this committee
 
01:36:16.550 --> 01:36:16.560 align:start position:0%
is holding people responsible for taking
 
01:36:16.560 --> 01:36:17.590 align:start position:0%
is holding people responsible for taking
care

01:36:17.590 --> 01:36:17.600 align:start position:0%
care
 
01:36:19.510 --> 01:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
of what they brought into this world and
 
01:36:19.520 --> 01:36:20.470 align:start position:0%
of what they brought into this world and
that's

01:36:20.470 --> 01:36:20.480 align:start position:0%
that's
 
01:36:22.470 --> 01:36:22.480 align:start position:0%
young children
 
01:36:24.629 --> 01:36:24.639 align:start position:0%
and also by the way our aggressively
 
01:36:27.109 --> 01:36:27.119 align:start position:0%
mature population otherwise known as
 
01:36:27.119 --> 01:36:29.830 align:start position:0%
mature population otherwise known as
elderly

01:36:29.830 --> 01:36:29.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:31.270 --> 01:36:31.280 align:start position:0%
just for the record
 
01:36:31.280 --> 01:36:32.470 align:start position:0%
just for the record
uh

01:36:32.470 --> 01:36:32.480 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:36:35.350 --> 01:36:35.360 align:start position:0%
and if one i uh walks the talk of of
 
01:36:37.270 --> 01:36:37.280 align:start position:0%
being responsible self-respect
 
01:36:40.149 --> 01:36:40.159 align:start position:0%
self-reliance or self-determination
 
01:36:41.510 --> 01:36:41.520 align:start position:0%
this issue
 
01:36:43.189 --> 01:36:43.199 align:start position:0%
here is to let
 
01:36:44.709 --> 01:36:44.719 align:start position:0%
individuals know
 
01:36:47.350 --> 01:36:47.360 align:start position:0%
and many are individuals but it's
 
01:36:49.350 --> 01:36:49.360 align:start position:0%
many single parents
 
01:36:51.750 --> 01:36:51.760 align:start position:0%
who are left to take care of their
 
01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:52.950 align:start position:0%
who are left to take care of their
children

01:36:52.950 --> 01:36:52.960 align:start position:0%
children
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
on their own and themselves
 
01:36:58.870 --> 01:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
that this program be facilitated in
 
01:37:00.550 --> 01:37:00.560 align:start position:0%
terms of notice
 
01:37:02.149 --> 01:37:02.159 align:start position:0%
and that an impetus to our
 
01:37:02.159 --> 01:37:03.510 align:start position:0%
and that an impetus to our
infrastructure

01:37:03.510 --> 01:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:37:05.750 --> 01:37:05.760 align:start position:0%
at health and human services
 
01:37:08.870 --> 01:37:08.880 align:start position:0%
know that there is a commitment from
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
us together
 
01:37:13.189 --> 01:37:13.199 align:start position:0%
that this be done while we're young
 
01:37:16.870 --> 01:37:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:19.270 --> 01:37:19.280 align:start position:0%
the sustainability of this program is
 
01:37:21.990 --> 01:37:22.000 align:start position:0%
not to add the cost it's to reduce the
 
01:37:23.910 --> 01:37:23.920 align:start position:0%
investment in the result
 
01:37:26.550 --> 01:37:26.560 align:start position:0%
of not doing something
 
01:37:29.430 --> 01:37:29.440 align:start position:0%
and the something here is notification
 
01:37:29.440 --> 01:37:30.790 align:start position:0%
and the something here is notification
knowledge

01:37:30.790 --> 01:37:30.800 align:start position:0%
knowledge
 
01:37:34.229 --> 01:37:34.239 align:start position:0%
and and holding folks accountable to
 
01:37:37.189 --> 01:37:37.199 align:start position:0%
follow the rules and like uh in closing
 
01:37:38.790 --> 01:37:38.800 align:start position:0%
i can tell you
 
01:37:40.470 --> 01:37:40.480 align:start position:0%
that this committee
 
01:37:42.790 --> 01:37:42.800 align:start position:0%
this entity where it happened right here
 
01:37:44.310 --> 01:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
we found that
 
01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:45.920 align:start position:0%
new hampshire people
 
01:37:47.669 --> 01:37:47.679 align:start position:0%
the vast majority
 
01:37:49.990 --> 01:37:50.000 align:start position:0%
do follow the rules
 
01:37:52.470 --> 01:37:52.480 align:start position:0%
they also have pride and self-respect
 
01:37:53.510 --> 01:37:53.520 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
01:37:55.750 --> 01:37:55.760 align:start position:0%
many times a difficult
 
01:37:57.750 --> 01:37:57.760 align:start position:0%
challenge for them to
 
01:38:00.229 --> 01:38:00.239 align:start position:0%
say i need help
 
01:38:02.629 --> 01:38:02.639 align:start position:0%
they need to know that help is here
 
01:38:05.590 --> 01:38:05.600 align:start position:0%
that it'll allow them to build from
 
01:38:09.189 --> 01:38:09.199 align:start position:0%
there to not have help in perpetuity
 
01:38:11.430 --> 01:38:11.440 align:start position:0%
and that's why i'm one that does support
 
01:38:13.669 --> 01:38:13.679 align:start position:0%
this effort here
 
01:38:15.669 --> 01:38:15.679 align:start position:0%
and also being cost effective as well
 
01:38:17.669 --> 01:38:17.679 align:start position:0%
because i do believe in that we need to
 
01:38:19.350 --> 01:38:19.360 align:start position:0%
hold people accountable
 
01:38:22.149 --> 01:38:22.159 align:start position:0%
but that it's not a
 
01:38:25.189 --> 01:38:25.199 align:start position:0%
program that will always be there
 
01:38:26.870 --> 01:38:26.880 align:start position:0%
for the individual is to get them
 
01:38:29.030 --> 01:38:29.040 align:start position:0%
transitioning off
 
01:38:31.830 --> 01:38:31.840 align:start position:0%
from when they need assistance and that
 
01:38:34.709 --> 01:38:34.719 align:start position:0%
we all discuss many variations on that
 
01:38:34.719 --> 01:38:35.430 align:start position:0%
we all discuss many variations on that
but

01:38:35.430 --> 01:38:35.440 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:38:38.470 --> 01:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
basic food right from birth on
 
01:38:41.030 --> 01:38:41.040 align:start position:0%
so that you can build from
 
01:38:43.189 --> 01:38:43.199 align:start position:0%
that area
 
01:38:45.109 --> 01:38:45.119 align:start position:0%
so i'm what i'm asking everyone here is
 
01:38:46.950 --> 01:38:46.960 align:start position:0%
um i do
 
01:38:46.960 --> 01:38:47.990 align:start position:0%
um i do
bring

01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
bring
 
01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:48.870 align:start position:0%
bring
some

01:38:48.870 --> 01:38:48.880 align:start position:0%
some
 
01:38:50.470 --> 01:38:50.480 align:start position:0%
personal experience i've learned right
 
01:38:51.990 --> 01:38:52.000 align:start position:0%
here on this committee
 
01:38:53.990 --> 01:38:54.000 align:start position:0%
it's it's not to give something away for
 
01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:55.030 align:start position:0%
it's it's not to give something away for
nothing

01:38:55.030 --> 01:38:55.040 align:start position:0%
nothing
 
01:38:57.910 --> 01:38:57.920 align:start position:0%
but uh it's to take care of our citizens
 
01:39:00.470 --> 01:39:00.480 align:start position:0%
here those who need it and this is uh
 
01:39:03.270 --> 01:39:03.280 align:start position:0%
knowledge that they need to know
 
01:39:05.510 --> 01:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
to make the right decisions and i'm
 
01:39:07.189 --> 01:39:07.199 align:start position:0%
hoping that you'll support
 
01:39:08.470 --> 01:39:08.480 align:start position:0%

be here before you today
 
01:41:10.709 --> 01:41:10.719 align:start position:0%
i am introducing
 
01:41:13.590 --> 01:41:13.600 align:start position:0%
senate bill 419 which establishes a
 
01:41:15.430 --> 01:41:15.440 align:start position:0%
commission to study the delivery of
 
01:41:18.229 --> 01:41:18.239 align:start position:0%
public health services in new hampshire
 
01:41:20.390 --> 01:41:20.400 align:start position:0%
through the 13 regional public health
 
01:41:22.550 --> 01:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
networks so i just want to i'm going to
 
01:41:24.550 --> 01:41:24.560 align:start position:0%
share a little history i won't take up
 
01:41:26.470 --> 01:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
too much time but i want to put this in
 
01:41:29.990 --> 01:41:30.000 align:start position:0%
context that public health is
 
01:41:32.229 --> 01:41:32.239 align:start position:0%
you know is in a is a community-based
 
01:41:36.070 --> 01:41:36.080 align:start position:0%
approach to the health and well-being of
 
01:41:38.070 --> 01:41:38.080 align:start position:0%
of everyone and our families and it
 
01:41:39.910 --> 01:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
ranges from i know we've heard a lot
 
01:41:42.390 --> 01:41:42.400 align:start position:0%
about it during covet 19 but i'd ask you
 
01:41:45.990 --> 01:41:46.000 align:start position:0%
to broaden your thinking on this uh to
 
01:41:49.990 --> 01:41:50.000 align:start position:0%
h1n1 to childhood obesity to child
 
01:41:53.750 --> 01:41:53.760 align:start position:0%
passenger safety to mental health to
 
01:41:56.870 --> 01:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
drug addiction whatever particular issue
 
01:42:00.229 --> 01:42:00.239 align:start position:0%
or issues are facing a community that's
 
01:42:02.310 --> 01:42:02.320 align:start position:0%
where a public health team
 
01:42:03.590 --> 01:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
comes in
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
i have some experience in this area
 
01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:06.470 align:start position:0%
i have some experience in this area
working

01:42:06.470 --> 01:42:06.480 align:start position:0%
working
 
01:42:08.390 --> 01:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
when i worked as the chief of emergency
 
01:42:10.149 --> 01:42:10.159 align:start position:0%
medical services for the department of
 
01:42:10.159 --> 01:42:11.750 align:start position:0%
medical services for the department of
safety

01:42:11.750 --> 01:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
safety
 
01:42:13.669 --> 01:42:13.679 align:start position:0%
was during the days when we were
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
actually taking working with these
 
01:42:20.149 --> 01:42:20.159 align:start position:0%
public health networks and
 
01:42:20.159 --> 01:42:20.950 align:start position:0%
public health networks and
really

01:42:20.950 --> 01:42:20.960 align:start position:0%
really
 
01:42:22.950 --> 01:42:22.960 align:start position:0%
taking some of the first steps to
 
01:42:25.510 --> 01:42:25.520 align:start position:0%
further institutionalize and memorialize
 
01:42:27.990 --> 01:42:28.000 align:start position:0%
their regional approach in new hampshire
 
01:42:30.709 --> 01:42:30.719 align:start position:0%
so with that in mind
 
01:42:32.629 --> 01:42:32.639 align:start position:0%
i want to just you know share a little
 
01:42:34.950 --> 01:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
history so in the late 1990s turning
 
01:42:37.270 --> 01:42:37.280 align:start position:0%
point grants helped establish these
 
01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:38.390 align:start position:0%
point grants helped establish these
networks

01:42:38.390 --> 01:42:38.400 align:start position:0%
networks
 
01:42:39.830 --> 01:42:39.840 align:start position:0%
that approach the delivery of public
 
01:42:41.510 --> 01:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
health services throughout the country
 
01:42:43.030 --> 01:42:43.040 align:start position:0%
but here in new hampshire bringing
 
01:42:44.870 --> 01:42:44.880 align:start position:0%
together communities that traditionally
 
01:42:48.390 --> 01:42:48.400 align:start position:0%
share services including fire mutual aid
 
01:42:50.470 --> 01:42:50.480 align:start position:0%
emergency medical services mutual aid
 
01:42:51.910 --> 01:42:51.920 align:start position:0%
health care
 
01:42:54.390 --> 01:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
hospital health care type of systems
 
01:42:56.390 --> 01:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
and that are geographically aligned as
 
01:42:57.669 --> 01:42:57.679 align:start position:0%
well as again work with the same
 
01:42:59.910 --> 01:42:59.920 align:start position:0%
hospital and health care communities
 
01:43:02.229 --> 01:43:02.239 align:start position:0%
as you already know
 
01:43:05.270 --> 01:43:05.280 align:start position:0%
their not every community has a public
 
01:43:06.950 --> 01:43:06.960 align:start position:0%
health department a full-time public
 
01:43:09.270 --> 01:43:09.280 align:start position:0%
health department exists in manchester
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
it exists in in nashua and then i
 
01:43:14.470 --> 01:43:14.480 align:start position:0%
understand we now have a part-time
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
public health department in portsmouth
 
01:43:20.629 --> 01:43:20.639 align:start position:0%
so the rest of the state relies on these
 
01:43:24.229 --> 01:43:24.239 align:start position:0%
regional networks to you know be the
 
01:43:27.030 --> 01:43:27.040 align:start position:0%
kind of the watchers and the helpers
 
01:43:28.470 --> 01:43:28.480 align:start position:0%
when there are
 
01:43:31.109 --> 01:43:31.119 align:start position:0%
public health issues that arise so i
 
01:43:32.390 --> 01:43:32.400 align:start position:0%
think that that is important to
 
01:43:32.400 --> 01:43:33.910 align:start position:0%
think that that is important to
understand

01:43:33.910 --> 01:43:33.920 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:43:36.149 --> 01:43:36.159 align:start position:0%
in the mid 2000s federal dollars came to
 
01:43:37.350 --> 01:43:37.360 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
01:43:39.030 --> 01:43:39.040 align:start position:0%
to build out the public health emergency
 
01:43:41.270 --> 01:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
preparedness capacity and again that is
 
01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:43.360 align:start position:0%
actually the part that i was most
 
01:43:46.229 --> 01:43:46.239 align:start position:0%
intimately involved in in new hampshire
 
01:43:48.229 --> 01:43:48.239 align:start position:0%
and most notably place the
 
01:43:50.870 --> 01:43:50.880 align:start position:0%
responsibility for this type of response
 
01:43:53.109 --> 01:43:53.119 align:start position:0%
with our public health networks
 
01:43:55.189 --> 01:43:55.199 align:start position:0%
many of you have come to know the work
 
01:43:57.830 --> 01:43:57.840 align:start position:0%
of our public health networks through
 
01:43:59.750 --> 01:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
coven 19 setting up
 
01:44:02.310 --> 01:44:02.320 align:start position:0%
sites for testing
 
01:44:05.830 --> 01:44:05.840 align:start position:0%
setting up sites for vaccination but
 
01:44:07.669 --> 01:44:07.679 align:start position:0%
setting up like well
 
01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:10.000 align:start position:0%
testing vaccination but i'd also
 
01:44:11.350 --> 01:44:11.360 align:start position:0%
like you to think back if you can
 
01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:12.550 align:start position:0%
like you to think back if you can
remember

01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
remember
 
01:44:14.390 --> 01:44:14.400 align:start position:0%
some of these issues there was a
 
01:44:16.870 --> 01:44:16.880 align:start position:0%
hepatitis outbreak at a fast food
 
01:44:18.790 --> 01:44:18.800 align:start position:0%
restaurant in the central part of new
 
01:44:20.550 --> 01:44:20.560 align:start position:0%
hampshire years ago when i worked at the
 
01:44:22.310 --> 01:44:22.320 align:start position:0%
department of safety and the way that
 
01:44:24.790 --> 01:44:24.800 align:start position:0%
they were actually able to help many
 
01:44:28.629 --> 01:44:28.639 align:start position:0%
people get the necessary medication out
 
01:44:31.109 --> 01:44:31.119 align:start position:0%
to folks was actually through
 
01:44:33.030 --> 01:44:33.040 align:start position:0%
a public health network
 
01:44:36.310 --> 01:44:36.320 align:start position:0%
and again consider that these networks
 
01:44:38.070 --> 01:44:38.080 align:start position:0%
work together
 
01:44:41.030 --> 01:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
they have common they overlap in many
 
01:44:42.629 --> 01:44:42.639 align:start position:0%
ways and that's how they become i want
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
to say good friends in partners and
 
01:44:46.790 --> 01:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
taking care of the public but they are
 
01:44:48.790 --> 01:44:48.800 align:start position:0%
dealing with other
 
01:44:51.669 --> 01:44:51.679 align:start position:0%
issues again child passenger safety
 
01:44:54.709 --> 01:44:54.719 align:start position:0%
would be an issue childhood obesity
 
01:44:54.719 --> 01:44:56.229 align:start position:0%
would be an issue childhood obesity
managing

01:44:56.229 --> 01:44:56.239 align:start position:0%
managing
 
01:44:58.550 --> 01:44:58.560 align:start position:0%
drug you know drug addiction in their
 
01:45:00.390 --> 01:45:00.400 align:start position:0%
community as well as mental health
 
01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:02.149 align:start position:0%
community as well as mental health
responses

01:45:02.149 --> 01:45:02.159 align:start position:0%
responses
 
01:45:05.350 --> 01:45:05.360 align:start position:0%
each area of the state may have a
 
01:45:07.430 --> 01:45:07.440 align:start position:0%
different focus for public health but
 
01:45:09.750 --> 01:45:09.760 align:start position:0%
somebody has to be watching this in
 
01:45:12.870 --> 01:45:12.880 align:start position:0%
order to be able to address this
 
01:45:15.430 --> 01:45:15.440 align:start position:0%
the state's health improvement plan
 
01:45:16.790 --> 01:45:16.800 align:start position:0%
cites regional approaches and
 
01:45:18.310 --> 01:45:18.320 align:start position:0%
infrastructure for public health as
 
01:45:21.510 --> 01:45:21.520 align:start position:0%
priorities independent c specifically
 
01:45:23.990 --> 01:45:24.000 align:start position:0%
what forces of change are impacting new
 
01:45:26.870 --> 01:45:26.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire includes a focus on addressing
 
01:45:29.189 --> 01:45:29.199 align:start position:0%
the limited public health capacity and
 
01:45:32.390 --> 01:45:32.400 align:start position:0%
ability to respond to emerging issues
 
01:45:35.189 --> 01:45:35.199 align:start position:0%
this included language or includes the
 
01:45:37.590 --> 01:45:37.600 align:start position:0%
regional public health networks
 
01:45:39.189 --> 01:45:39.199 align:start position:0%
now more than ever we understand the
 
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
importance of a coordinated delivery
 
01:45:44.149 --> 01:45:44.159 align:start position:0%
system and the work that public health
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
networks can and have performed
 
01:45:49.189 --> 01:45:49.199 align:start position:0%
but we don't i'm coming forward with
 
01:45:49.199 --> 01:45:50.310 align:start position:0%
but we don't i'm coming forward with
this

01:45:50.310 --> 01:45:50.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:45:52.229 --> 01:45:52.239 align:start position:0%
this bill to form a study commission
 
01:45:54.709 --> 01:45:54.719 align:start position:0%
because we have answers we don't have
 
01:45:58.070 --> 01:45:58.080 align:start position:0%
answers to questions and we don't have
 
01:46:00.709 --> 01:46:00.719 align:start position:0%
an infrastructure that is built out in
 
01:46:02.790 --> 01:46:02.800 align:start position:0%
the state that's consistent we have
 
01:46:04.310 --> 01:46:04.320 align:start position:0%
again regional approaches that are doing
 
01:46:05.750 --> 01:46:05.760 align:start position:0%
the best they can
 
01:46:07.990 --> 01:46:08.000 align:start position:0%
with limited funding sources we have
 
01:46:10.629 --> 01:46:10.639 align:start position:0%
some full-time departments but it leaves
 
01:46:13.350 --> 01:46:13.360 align:start position:0%
us with questions about how this should
 
01:46:15.109 --> 01:46:15.119 align:start position:0%
best be done and that's what i'm asking
 
01:46:16.950 --> 01:46:16.960 align:start position:0%
you to consider today
 
01:46:16.960 --> 01:46:17.750 align:start position:0%
you to consider today
so

01:46:17.750 --> 01:46:17.760 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:46:19.669 --> 01:46:19.679 align:start position:0%
this commission would review the
 
01:46:22.070 --> 01:46:22.080 align:start position:0%
operations of the 13 public health
 
01:46:24.070 --> 01:46:24.080 align:start position:0%
networks i want to be clear that even if
 
01:46:26.149 --> 01:46:26.159 align:start position:0%
you're in manchester or nashua or
 
01:46:28.310 --> 01:46:28.320 align:start position:0%
portsmouth and you may have you know
 
01:46:30.149 --> 01:46:30.159 align:start position:0%
funded public health capacity you're
 
01:46:32.310 --> 01:46:32.320 align:start position:0%
still part of these networks so it's a
 
01:46:35.669 --> 01:46:35.679 align:start position:0%
very inclusive way of doing their work
 
01:46:37.109 --> 01:46:37.119 align:start position:0%
review the regional public health
 
01:46:39.430 --> 01:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
priorities across the state
 
01:46:41.109 --> 01:46:41.119 align:start position:0%
propose a plan for the provision and
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
implementation of sustainable programs
 
01:46:45.830 --> 01:46:45.840 align:start position:0%
practices governance and policies that
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
are evidence-based to improve health
 
01:46:49.750 --> 01:46:49.760 align:start position:0%
outcomes across new hampshire
 
01:46:51.270 --> 01:46:51.280 align:start position:0%
review the management of public health
 
01:46:53.590 --> 01:46:53.600 align:start position:0%
emergencies at the state and local level
 
01:46:55.590 --> 01:46:55.600 align:start position:0%
review the coordination of services
 
01:46:57.830 --> 01:46:57.840 align:start position:0%
among partners to include local public
 
01:47:00.790 --> 01:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
health officers and propose a plan for
 
01:47:03.270 --> 01:47:03.280 align:start position:0%
how to optimize these services
 
01:47:05.830 --> 01:47:05.840 align:start position:0%
so again this is a commission to study
 
01:47:08.470 --> 01:47:08.480 align:start position:0%
which i think is a question a series of
 
01:47:11.109 --> 01:47:11.119 align:start position:0%
questions that need to be answered and
 
01:47:12.390 --> 01:47:12.400 align:start position:0%
that commission
 
01:47:15.189 --> 01:47:15.199 align:start position:0%
would then report out before any actions
 
01:47:17.669 --> 01:47:17.679 align:start position:0%
were taken so i've been studying this
 
01:47:19.590 --> 01:47:19.600 align:start position:0%
you know kind of you know from my uh you
 
01:47:21.350 --> 01:47:21.360 align:start position:0%
know my home in lebanon and my prior
 
01:47:23.910 --> 01:47:23.920 align:start position:0%
work in the state for years and thinking
 
01:47:25.910 --> 01:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
about what's the best approach and so
 
01:47:27.830 --> 01:47:27.840 align:start position:0%
i'm asking you to join me in broadening
 
01:47:31.030 --> 01:47:31.040 align:start position:0%
your thinking about public health
 
01:47:33.109 --> 01:47:33.119 align:start position:0%
investing in and this is not a financial
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
investment investment this is a policy
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
investment well a strategic policy
 
01:47:38.950 --> 01:47:38.960 align:start position:0%
investment and setting up a commission
 
01:47:41.030 --> 01:47:41.040 align:start position:0%
to answer questions that i have but i
 
01:47:43.030 --> 01:47:43.040 align:start position:0%
bet that you have as well
 
01:47:45.590 --> 01:47:45.600 align:start position:0%
so i will conclude my testimony i'll do
 
01:47:47.910 --> 01:47:47.920 align:start position:0%
my best to answer any questions that you
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
have and i see hands going up i'm ready
 
01:47:53.590 --> 01:47:53.600 align:start position:0%
okay representative leon
 
01:47:56.229 --> 01:47:56.239 align:start position:0%
uh representative folsom
 
01:47:57.990 --> 01:47:58.000 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
 
01:47:58.000 --> 01:47:59.270 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you for taking my
question

01:47:59.270 --> 01:47:59.280 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:48:01.669 --> 01:48:01.679 align:start position:0%
um reading through the bill i just want
 
01:48:04.870 --> 01:48:04.880 align:start position:0%
to confirm this looks like a a one and
 
01:48:06.950 --> 01:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
done kind of commission
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
get together review this
 
01:48:11.750 --> 01:48:11.760 align:start position:0%
provide a report the commission ends
 
01:48:13.430 --> 01:48:13.440 align:start position:0%
correct is that okay thank you you're
 
01:48:14.790 --> 01:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
welcome thank you for the question
 
01:48:16.950 --> 01:48:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative representative kanark
 
01:48:18.310 --> 01:48:18.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh yes i had a
 
01:48:20.629 --> 01:48:20.639 align:start position:0%
question i serving as the chair of the
 
01:48:21.990 --> 01:48:22.000 align:start position:0%
state health assessment state health
 
01:48:23.750 --> 01:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
improvement plan advisory council
 
01:48:25.910 --> 01:48:25.920 align:start position:0%
currently in our march meeting we did
 
01:48:27.350 --> 01:48:27.360 align:start position:0%
have a report
 
01:48:29.430 --> 01:48:29.440 align:start position:0%
from the
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%
new hampshire health officer association
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
and we are that's part of our charge as
 
01:48:35.270 --> 01:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
well so i was glad to hear you reference
 
01:48:37.830 --> 01:48:37.840 align:start position:0%
the previous ship and the question is is
 
01:48:40.310 --> 01:48:40.320 align:start position:0%
there any redundancy or do you see that
 
01:48:42.070 --> 01:48:42.080 align:start position:0%
these are complementary where ship
 
01:48:44.229 --> 01:48:44.239 align:start position:0%
guides the ship shall we say is where
 
01:48:46.790 --> 01:48:46.800 align:start position:0%
we're going to go and this is the idea
 
01:48:48.709 --> 01:48:48.719 align:start position:0%
of how to actually then implement it
 
01:48:50.310 --> 01:48:50.320 align:start position:0%
with the boots on the ground is that are
 
01:48:51.669 --> 01:48:51.679 align:start position:0%
they complementary to one another and
 
01:48:53.350 --> 01:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
not redundant i i think they're
 
01:48:54.870 --> 01:48:54.880 align:start position:0%
complementary i don't think that they're
 
01:48:57.669 --> 01:48:57.679 align:start position:0%
redundant um and i also think that this
 
01:49:00.790 --> 01:49:00.800 align:start position:0%
if i may quickly that
 
01:49:02.470 --> 01:49:02.480 align:start position:0%
it will answer questions whether there's
 
01:49:05.510 --> 01:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
implementation or not is to be decided
 
01:49:07.030 --> 01:49:07.040 align:start position:0%
but these questions i believe need to be
 
01:49:08.790 --> 01:49:08.800 align:start position:0%
answered first thank you very much thank
 
01:49:08.800 --> 01:49:09.750 align:start position:0%
answered first thank you very much thank
you

01:49:09.750 --> 01:49:09.760 align:start position:0%
you
 
01:49:11.910 --> 01:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
01:49:13.350 --> 01:49:13.360 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
01:49:15.350 --> 01:49:15.360 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh certainly
 
01:49:18.390 --> 01:49:18.400 align:start position:0%
public health uh is
 
01:49:20.070 --> 01:49:20.080 align:start position:0%
of paramount importance and its
 
01:49:22.629 --> 01:49:22.639 align:start position:0%
coordination is eve even uh to make it
 
01:49:24.470 --> 01:49:24.480 align:start position:0%
useful has to be coordinated to say the
 
01:49:28.709 --> 01:49:28.719 align:start position:0%
least i do have concerns however
 
01:49:31.189 --> 01:49:31.199 align:start position:0%
this is to me as i read this and maybe
 
01:49:34.709 --> 01:49:34.719 align:start position:0%
it's my ignorance showing is a huge
 
01:49:34.719 --> 01:49:37.109 align:start position:0%
it's my ignorance showing is a huge
ask

01:49:37.109 --> 01:49:37.119 align:start position:0%
ask
 
01:49:39.910 --> 01:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
when i say review the court uh a purpose
 
01:49:41.350 --> 01:49:41.360 align:start position:0%
or provision implementation of
 
01:49:43.589 --> 01:49:43.599 align:start position:0%
sustainable programs practices
 
01:49:45.750 --> 01:49:45.760 align:start position:0%
governance policies that are evidenced i
 
01:49:48.310 --> 01:49:48.320 align:start position:0%
mean that is i mean that is really very
 
01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:49.910 align:start position:0%
mean that is i mean that is really very
broad

01:49:49.910 --> 01:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
broad
 
01:49:49.920 --> 01:49:50.870 align:start position:0%
broad
and

01:49:50.870 --> 01:49:50.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:53.350 --> 01:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
to put that together i mean that's still
 
01:49:55.350 --> 01:49:55.360 align:start position:0%
certainly doable and certainly if you
 
01:49:57.270 --> 01:49:57.280 align:start position:0%
look at but
 
01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
i'm concerned uh that
 
01:50:03.669 --> 01:50:03.679 align:start position:0%
that it would terminate in six months
 
01:50:05.990 --> 01:50:06.000 align:start position:0%
so here we have a commission
 
01:50:08.310 --> 01:50:08.320 align:start position:0%
to do this huge
 
01:50:11.270 --> 01:50:11.280 align:start position:0%
job which is certainly needed but isn't
 
01:50:14.550 --> 01:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
the the november 20 of of this year a
 
01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:15.430 align:start position:0%
the the november 20 of of this year a
little

01:50:15.430 --> 01:50:15.440 align:start position:0%
little
 
01:50:15.440 --> 01:50:16.550 align:start position:0%
little
soon

01:50:16.550 --> 01:50:16.560 align:start position:0%
soon
 
01:50:20.149 --> 01:50:20.159 align:start position:0%
um i'm very concerned about that
 
01:50:20.159 --> 01:50:21.830 align:start position:0%
um i'm very concerned about that
yes

01:50:21.830 --> 01:50:21.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:50:23.350 --> 01:50:23.360 align:start position:0%
yes so
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
representative am i hearing you saying
 
01:50:25.910 --> 01:50:25.920 align:start position:0%
that you think
 
01:50:25.920 --> 01:50:27.270 align:start position:0%
that you think
that

01:50:27.270 --> 01:50:27.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:29.750 --> 01:50:29.760 align:start position:0%
the period of time for the work of the
 
01:50:33.189 --> 01:50:33.199 align:start position:0%
commission is not long enough correct i
 
01:50:36.470 --> 01:50:36.480 align:start position:0%
just for the magnitude of the ask
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
the time frame especially
 
01:50:40.390 --> 01:50:40.400 align:start position:0%
with the difficulty getting commissions
 
01:50:42.229 --> 01:50:42.239 align:start position:0%
together we're told
 
01:50:45.589 --> 01:50:45.599 align:start position:0%
um remember and also uh it's summer uh
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be hard to get people from
 
01:50:50.629 --> 01:50:50.639 align:start position:0%
around and also it's election year
 
01:50:50.639 --> 01:50:51.510 align:start position:0%
around and also it's election year
uh

01:50:51.510 --> 01:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:50:53.910 --> 01:50:53.920 align:start position:0%
people are going to be you know so all
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
factors together from a functional
 
01:50:55.679 --> 01:50:56.950 align:start position:0%
factors together from a functional
perspective

01:50:56.950 --> 01:50:56.960 align:start position:0%
perspective
 
01:50:56.960 --> 01:50:57.669 align:start position:0%
perspective
i

01:50:57.669 --> 01:50:57.679 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
i would just hate to see it
 
01:51:05.030 --> 01:51:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:07.669 --> 01:51:07.679 align:start position:0%
okay would the senator be interested in
 
01:51:08.870 --> 01:51:08.880 align:start position:0%
an amendment
 
01:51:11.030 --> 01:51:11.040 align:start position:0%
simply stretching it out further
 
01:51:12.709 --> 01:51:12.719 align:start position:0%
committee amendment to stretch it out
 
01:51:14.070 --> 01:51:14.080 align:start position:0%
further we could do a committee
 
01:51:17.189 --> 01:51:17.199 align:start position:0%
amendment here um
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
would you like that i would
 
01:51:20.709 --> 01:51:20.719 align:start position:0%
representative woods how long do you
 
01:51:23.270 --> 01:51:23.280 align:start position:0%
think it would be
 
01:51:25.910 --> 01:51:25.920 align:start position:0%
feasible my perspective i again i'm not
 
01:51:27.189 --> 01:51:27.199 align:start position:0%
in the public health here and i'm not
 
01:51:29.030 --> 01:51:29.040 align:start position:0%
familiar with these areas so i don't
 
01:51:31.189 --> 01:51:31.199 align:start position:0%
know how complex it is but i would think
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:39.119 align:start position:0%
so i would
 
01:51:40.470 --> 01:51:40.480 align:start position:0%
may i
 
01:51:43.830 --> 01:51:43.840 align:start position:0%
thank you um i'm amenable to additional
 
01:51:46.550 --> 01:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
time and up to a year and if we can
 
01:51:49.589 --> 01:51:49.599 align:start position:0%
complete our work uh before that then
 
01:51:52.070 --> 01:51:52.080 align:start position:0%
then we'll will be done i understand
 
01:51:54.550 --> 01:51:54.560 align:start position:0%
it's a big job i mean there are 13
 
01:51:56.149 --> 01:51:56.159 align:start position:0%
regional public health networks and i
 
01:51:57.669 --> 01:51:57.679 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
they all you know they all are at the
 
01:52:03.350 --> 01:52:03.360 align:start position:0%
table so thank you let me interrupt here
 
01:52:05.430 --> 01:52:05.440 align:start position:0%
at this point because i'm about to ask
 
01:52:09.350 --> 01:52:09.360 align:start position:0%
the committee um researcher if she would
 
01:52:09.360 --> 01:52:10.629 align:start position:0%
the committee um researcher if she would
continue

01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
continue
 
01:52:12.070 --> 01:52:12.080 align:start position:0%
to write out that amendment just
 
01:52:15.750 --> 01:52:15.760 align:start position:0%
changing it one year further
 
01:52:18.790 --> 01:52:18.800 align:start position:0%
amendment woods pearson can can work on
 
01:52:21.270 --> 01:52:21.280 align:start position:0%
that and just want us before she hit
 
01:52:23.430 --> 01:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
send make sure that that sounds pretty
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
good to us just nod
 
01:52:28.070 --> 01:52:28.080 align:start position:0%
you're nodding all in the same direction
 
01:52:30.470 --> 01:52:30.480 align:start position:0%
okay hit send thank you
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh where were we representative merchant
 
01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:36.960 align:start position:0%
if that amendment the other option could
 
01:52:39.350 --> 01:52:39.360 align:start position:0%
be from this work of this group is one
 
01:52:40.709 --> 01:52:40.719 align:start position:0%
of the outcomes could be the fact that
 
01:52:42.870 --> 01:52:42.880 align:start position:0%
we want to extend it so the amendment
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
takes care of that but if it hadn't been
 
01:52:45.990 --> 01:52:46.000 align:start position:0%
for the amendment i was going to make a
 
01:52:47.350 --> 01:52:47.360 align:start position:0%
comment that
 
01:52:48.870 --> 01:52:48.880 align:start position:0%
the outcome of this commission even
 
01:52:50.149 --> 01:52:50.159 align:start position:0%
though it's short-lived could be the
 
01:52:52.870 --> 01:52:52.880 align:start position:0%
fact that we need to continue it
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
it just was an option itself okay
 
01:52:57.510 --> 01:52:57.520 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman thank you senator
 
01:53:03.030 --> 01:53:03.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:03.040 --> 01:53:04.070 align:start position:0%
 
since

01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:04.080 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:53:05.669 --> 01:53:05.679 align:start position:0%
since you're bringing this forward and
 
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
since there already are regional public
 
01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:09.830 align:start position:0%
since there already are regional public
health

01:53:09.830 --> 01:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
health
 
01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:10.790 align:start position:0%
health
groups

01:53:10.790 --> 01:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
groups
 
01:53:12.470 --> 01:53:12.480 align:start position:0%
i assume that there's a problem that
 
01:53:14.870 --> 01:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
we're trying to fix so i wonder if you
 
01:53:14.880 --> 01:53:17.830 align:start position:0%
we're trying to fix so i wonder if you
could

01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:17.840 --> 01:53:19.109 align:start position:0%
 
give

01:53:19.109 --> 01:53:19.119 align:start position:0%
give
 
01:53:21.270 --> 01:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
some examples of
 
01:53:23.830 --> 01:53:23.840 align:start position:0%
deficiencies in the system we have now
 
01:53:26.629 --> 01:53:26.639 align:start position:0%
that have maybe been uncovered with
 
01:53:28.950 --> 01:53:28.960 align:start position:0%
recent crises i mean covet is the
 
01:53:30.790 --> 01:53:30.800 align:start position:0%
obvious example but it could be other
 
01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:32.149 align:start position:0%
obvious example but it could be other
things

01:53:32.149 --> 01:53:32.159 align:start position:0%
things
 
01:53:34.470 --> 01:53:34.480 align:start position:0%
what are the shortcomings in our system
 
01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:35.669 align:start position:0%
what are the shortcomings in our system
as

01:53:35.669 --> 01:53:35.679 align:start position:0%
as
 
01:53:37.750 --> 01:53:37.760 align:start position:0%
as it exists currently
 
01:53:38.870 --> 01:53:38.880 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro so the
 
01:53:43.750 --> 01:53:43.760 align:start position:0%
shortcoming or shortcomings that that i
 
01:53:45.270 --> 01:53:45.280 align:start position:0%
see that i want to address is the fact
 
01:53:46.709 --> 01:53:46.719 align:start position:0%
that we don't
 
01:53:46.719 --> 01:53:48.310 align:start position:0%
that we don't
have

01:53:48.310 --> 01:53:48.320 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:53:51.030 --> 01:53:51.040 align:start position:0%
really a permanent type of system like a
 
01:53:52.470 --> 01:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
backbone that's built out in new
 
01:53:54.790 --> 01:53:54.800 align:start position:0%
hampshire we know we have these networks
 
01:53:56.950 --> 01:53:56.960 align:start position:0%
we know that they do a good job they
 
01:53:59.109 --> 01:53:59.119 align:start position:0%
work under contract with health and
 
01:54:01.270 --> 01:54:01.280 align:start position:0%
human services they have mixed sources
 
01:54:03.750 --> 01:54:03.760 align:start position:0%
of funding and i don't see that ending
 
01:54:05.830 --> 01:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
but what it does is it it leaves this
 
01:54:08.070 --> 01:54:08.080 align:start position:0%
big hole well the funding ending but
 
01:54:11.270 --> 01:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
what if the funding did end um and
 
01:54:14.229 --> 01:54:14.239 align:start position:0%
where are we without a you know like a
 
01:54:15.990 --> 01:54:16.000 align:start position:0%
permanent backbone do we need a
 
01:54:18.070 --> 01:54:18.080 align:start position:0%
permanent structure for this and that's
 
01:54:19.910 --> 01:54:19.920 align:start position:0%
that's the question like
 
01:54:22.070 --> 01:54:22.080 align:start position:0%
they are working hard and doing a good
 
01:54:24.870 --> 01:54:24.880 align:start position:0%
job not all of them are equal as well
 
01:54:26.950 --> 01:54:26.960 align:start position:0%
and that's not saying that one
 
01:54:29.750 --> 01:54:29.760 align:start position:0%
public health network isn't doing
 
01:54:31.990 --> 01:54:32.000 align:start position:0%
you know as good a job as another but
 
01:54:34.870 --> 01:54:34.880 align:start position:0%
their their size and some of them depend
 
01:54:37.350 --> 01:54:37.360 align:start position:0%
on volunteers to do some of their work
 
01:54:38.629 --> 01:54:38.639 align:start position:0%
you know there's
 
01:54:40.950 --> 01:54:40.960 align:start position:0%
there's so many layers to this that i
 
01:54:43.750 --> 01:54:43.760 align:start position:0%
find it find it complicated and i what i
 
01:54:46.229 --> 01:54:46.239 align:start position:0%
want to do is help these organizations
 
01:54:48.149 --> 01:54:48.159 align:start position:0%
and help the state look at what their
 
01:54:49.750 --> 01:54:49.760 align:start position:0%
future is for a public health
 
01:54:49.760 --> 01:54:51.510 align:start position:0%
future is for a public health
infrastructure

01:54:51.510 --> 01:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:54:53.430 --> 01:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
it might be more consistency across the
 
01:54:55.669 --> 01:54:55.679 align:start position:0%
board more uniformity between their
 
01:54:55.679 --> 01:54:56.950 align:start position:0%
board more uniformity between their
practices

01:54:56.950 --> 01:54:56.960 align:start position:0%
practices
 
01:54:59.350 --> 01:54:59.360 align:start position:0%
but it it might not depending on what
 
01:55:01.270 --> 01:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
gets said what gets said and worked on
 
01:55:02.709 --> 01:55:02.719 align:start position:0%
within this group
 
01:55:04.790 --> 01:55:04.800 align:start position:0%
so that is the best that is really where
 
01:55:06.550 --> 01:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
my focus is what's the what's the
 
01:55:08.390 --> 01:55:08.400 align:start position:0%
backbone what are we going to do thank
 
01:55:10.629 --> 01:55:10.639 align:start position:0%
you you're welcome thank you
 
01:55:13.910 --> 01:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
representative snow
 
01:55:15.750 --> 01:55:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
01:55:16.790 --> 01:55:16.800 align:start position:0%
taking my
 
01:55:19.430 --> 01:55:19.440 align:start position:0%
question i noticed at the end there is
 
01:55:22.629 --> 01:55:22.639 align:start position:0%
currently apparently under rsa 127
 
01:55:24.070 --> 01:55:24.080 align:start position:0%
colon 12
 
01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.270 align:start position:0%
colon 12
a

01:55:25.270 --> 01:55:25.280 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:55:27.350 --> 01:55:27.360 align:start position:0%
commission to study
 
01:55:28.870 --> 01:55:28.880 align:start position:0%
public health systems throughout new
 
01:55:30.870 --> 01:55:30.880 align:start position:0%
hampshire which is going to be repealed
 
01:55:32.709 --> 01:55:32.719 align:start position:0%
now i don't know what you mean by study
 
01:55:35.109 --> 01:55:35.119 align:start position:0%
did they establish a plan
 
01:55:37.189 --> 01:55:37.199 align:start position:0%
like you're proposing to do always this
 
01:55:38.390 --> 01:55:38.400 align:start position:0%
to study
 
01:55:39.669 --> 01:55:39.679 align:start position:0%
kind of a
 
01:55:42.550 --> 01:55:42.560 align:start position:0%
a committee to encourage collaboration
 
01:55:44.310 --> 01:55:44.320 align:start position:0%
among the regional networks and to work
 
01:55:44.320 --> 01:55:45.270 align:start position:0%
among the regional networks and to work
together

01:55:45.270 --> 01:55:45.280 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:55:47.270 --> 01:55:47.280 align:start position:0%
or is the assumption if this is now
 
01:55:47.280 --> 01:55:48.629 align:start position:0%
or is the assumption if this is now
repealed

01:55:48.629 --> 01:55:48.639 align:start position:0%
repealed
 
01:55:50.550 --> 01:55:50.560 align:start position:0%
the only thing holding all those
 
01:55:53.510 --> 01:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
networks together is the department of
 
01:55:55.430 --> 01:55:55.440 align:start position:0%
human health and human services that's
 
01:55:58.950 --> 01:55:58.960 align:start position:0%
correct so that and that's and
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
you think that's enough to really
 
01:56:01.910 --> 01:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
because i think one of the things i
 
01:56:03.910 --> 01:56:03.920 align:start position:0%
worked a good deal i spent a good deal
 
01:56:05.990 --> 01:56:06.000 align:start position:0%
of time working with the manchester
 
01:56:07.830 --> 01:56:07.840 align:start position:0%
regional public which i'm very impressed
 
01:56:09.830 --> 01:56:09.840 align:start position:0%
with by the way and the people who work
 
01:56:11.830 --> 01:56:11.840 align:start position:0%
down there are really top top of the
 
01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.830 align:start position:0%
down there are really top top of the
line

01:56:13.830 --> 01:56:13.840 align:start position:0%
line
 
01:56:15.430 --> 01:56:15.440 align:start position:0%
and they do encourage getting involved
 
01:56:17.030 --> 01:56:17.040 align:start position:0%
with other communities and i think
 
01:56:19.109 --> 01:56:19.119 align:start position:0%
collaborating with smaller communities
 
01:56:20.790 --> 01:56:20.800 align:start position:0%
that come along and
 
01:56:23.030 --> 01:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
both in terms of coaching and making
 
01:56:25.430 --> 01:56:25.440 align:start position:0%
suggestions is a good idea and i would
 
01:56:27.030 --> 01:56:27.040 align:start position:0%
not want to see anything happen with
 
01:56:32.470 --> 01:56:32.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:33.830 --> 01:56:33.840 align:start position:0%
thank you representatives there's your
 
01:56:35.990 --> 01:56:36.000 align:start position:0%
question if this
 
01:56:38.070 --> 01:56:38.080 align:start position:0%
if if this delivery you know the study
 
01:56:40.070 --> 01:56:40.080 align:start position:0%
on public health services were to be
 
01:56:41.270 --> 01:56:41.280 align:start position:0%
pulled back that it might have a
 
01:56:42.390 --> 01:56:42.400 align:start position:0%
negative impact
 
01:56:44.390 --> 01:56:44.400 align:start position:0%
yes well if that seems to be the only
 
01:56:46.310 --> 01:56:46.320 align:start position:0%
committee that connects them
 
01:56:48.629 --> 01:56:48.639 align:start position:0%
other than that all have contracts with
 
01:56:49.589 --> 01:56:49.599 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
 
01:56:49.599 --> 01:56:50.709 align:start position:0%
the department of health and human
services

01:56:50.709 --> 01:56:50.719 align:start position:0%
services
 
01:56:50.719 --> 01:56:51.910 align:start position:0%
services
but

01:56:51.910 --> 01:56:51.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:56:54.470 --> 01:56:54.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes a committee like this
 
01:56:56.390 --> 01:56:56.400 align:start position:0%
in a more informal way encourage more
 
01:57:01.109 --> 01:57:01.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:03.589 --> 01:57:03.599 align:start position:0%
this would be yeah so this would be this
 
01:57:04.790 --> 01:57:04.800 align:start position:0%
would be all-encompassing and
 
01:57:06.870 --> 01:57:06.880 align:start position:0%
all-inclusive so it would be in its
 
01:57:06.880 --> 01:57:09.589 align:start position:0%
all-inclusive so it would be in its
place

01:57:09.589 --> 01:57:09.599 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:11.510 --> 01:57:11.520 align:start position:0%
but the commission ends
 
01:57:13.030 --> 01:57:13.040 align:start position:0%
when you're proposing ends the
 
01:57:15.350 --> 01:57:15.360 align:start position:0%
commission would end but this also here
 
01:57:18.550 --> 01:57:18.560 align:start position:0%
um is john williams in the room john
 
01:57:20.070 --> 01:57:20.080 align:start position:0%
do you want to come up here can i
 
01:57:22.070 --> 01:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
represent you absolutely he lives here
 
01:57:25.030 --> 01:57:25.040 align:start position:0%
you know that yes i know and i work
 
01:57:28.790 --> 01:57:28.800 align:start position:0%
certainly with my um my friends at dhhs
 
01:57:30.950 --> 01:57:30.960 align:start position:0%
on this so there's a commission to study
 
01:57:32.950 --> 01:57:32.960 align:start position:0%
the delivery of public health services
 
01:57:34.790 --> 01:57:34.800 align:start position:0%
isn't this the repeal of this commission
 
01:57:36.629 --> 01:57:36.639 align:start position:0%
this this rep this is the repeal date
 
01:57:38.550 --> 01:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
for this commission that's exactly what
 
01:57:40.790 --> 01:57:40.800 align:start position:0%
this does it's a very nice cleanup so
 
01:57:42.790 --> 01:57:42.800 align:start position:0%
when it sunsets it's actually provides
 
01:57:44.709 --> 01:57:44.719 align:start position:0%
provision for the repeal and the sunset
 
01:57:47.189 --> 01:57:47.199 align:start position:0%
yes and again the inclusiveness so that
 
01:57:48.790 --> 01:57:48.800 align:start position:0%
everything would move forward that that
 
01:57:50.550 --> 01:57:50.560 align:start position:0%
committee does not
 
01:57:53.990 --> 01:57:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:55.750 --> 01:57:55.760 align:start position:0%
i thought this was a separate committee
 
01:57:57.430 --> 01:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
from the one that you're proposing and
 
01:57:58.790 --> 01:57:58.800 align:start position:0%
this is going out of business and this
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
is replacing it and that's not the case
 
01:58:03.350 --> 01:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
and and you don't really feel we need to
 
01:58:04.470 --> 01:58:04.480 align:start position:0%
have a
 
01:58:07.910 --> 01:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
oversight committee to look at that well
 
01:58:10.550 --> 01:58:10.560 align:start position:0%
this commission could establish either
 
01:58:12.310 --> 01:58:12.320 align:start position:0%
re-establish that or something similar
 
01:58:14.070 --> 01:58:14.080 align:start position:0%
thank you those are those are like the
 
01:58:16.229 --> 01:58:16.239 align:start position:0%
lingering questions okay thank you
 
01:58:17.270 --> 01:58:17.280 align:start position:0%
you're welcome

thank you mr chairman uh thank you
 
01:58:25.750 --> 01:58:25.760 align:start position:0%
senator um and i
 
01:58:27.109 --> 01:58:27.119 align:start position:0%
brief statement
 
01:58:29.189 --> 01:58:29.199 align:start position:0%
leading up to the question and this is
 
01:58:31.350 --> 01:58:31.360 align:start position:0%
in the context of the chairman's known
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:38.790 --> 01:58:38.800 align:start position:0%
and it's my job it's not necessarily my
 
01:58:38.800 --> 01:58:40.790 align:start position:0%
and it's my job it's not necessarily my
preference

01:58:40.790 --> 01:58:40.800 align:start position:0%
preference
 
01:58:43.030 --> 01:58:43.040 align:start position:0%
speaking as someone who has some
 
01:58:45.109 --> 01:58:45.119 align:start position:0%
expertise in the area of community
 
01:58:46.950 --> 01:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
health i would like to say that our
 
01:58:48.470 --> 01:58:48.480 align:start position:0%
public health system here in new
 
01:58:51.109 --> 01:58:51.119 align:start position:0%
hampshire is right up there timely and
 
01:58:51.119 --> 01:58:53.109 align:start position:0%
hampshire is right up there timely and
medieval

01:58:53.109 --> 01:58:53.119 align:start position:0%
medieval
 
01:58:55.990 --> 01:58:56.000 align:start position:0%
and our ability to handle
 
01:58:57.910 --> 01:58:57.920 align:start position:0%
the public health threats
 
01:58:59.830 --> 01:58:59.840 align:start position:0%
is right up there with our establishment
 
01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:03.679 align:start position:0%
of arms houses indentured servitude the
 
01:59:06.229 --> 01:59:06.239 align:start position:0%
burning of witches to stop outbreaks and
 
01:59:06.239 --> 01:59:07.669 align:start position:0%
burning of witches to stop outbreaks and
bloodletting

01:59:07.669 --> 01:59:07.679 align:start position:0%
bloodletting
 
01:59:09.589 --> 01:59:09.599 align:start position:0%
and what we're talking about doing is
 
01:59:12.149 --> 01:59:12.159 align:start position:0%
creating a commission which will issue a
 
01:59:14.629 --> 01:59:14.639 align:start position:0%
report which will gather substantial
 
01:59:17.109 --> 01:59:17.119 align:start position:0%
amounts of dust probably with microbes
 
01:59:18.470 --> 01:59:18.480 align:start position:0%
within it
 
01:59:20.629 --> 01:59:20.639 align:start position:0%
that will sit on a shelf
 
01:59:22.470 --> 01:59:22.480 align:start position:0%
would this not work better here's the
 
01:59:25.270 --> 01:59:25.280 align:start position:0%
question would this not work better
 
01:59:28.310 --> 01:59:28.320 align:start position:0%
as a standing committee of the oversight
 
01:59:30.470 --> 01:59:30.480 align:start position:0%
committee on health and human services
 
01:59:32.629 --> 01:59:32.639 align:start position:0%
because as representative woods points
 
01:59:35.669 --> 01:59:35.679 align:start position:0%
out this is a huge task it's an ongoing
 
01:59:37.910 --> 01:59:37.920 align:start position:0%
task and we need to put a structure in
 
01:59:41.109 --> 01:59:41.119 align:start position:0%
place that's going to build and maintain
 
01:59:42.950 --> 01:59:42.960 align:start position:0%
a public health system wouldn't that
 
01:59:47.030 --> 01:59:47.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:49.669 --> 01:59:49.679 align:start position:0%
would the representative add leeches to
 
01:59:51.589 --> 01:59:51.599 align:start position:0%
that list
 
01:59:53.669 --> 01:59:53.679 align:start position:0%
i think i heard leeches
 
01:59:58.950 --> 01:59:58.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.030 --> 02:00:05.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:06.229 align:start position:0%
 
honestly

02:00:06.229 --> 02:00:06.239 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
02:00:07.750 --> 02:00:07.760 align:start position:0%
no i'd like you to lie through your
 
02:00:07.760 --> 02:00:11.270 align:start position:0%
no i'd like you to lie through your
teeth

02:00:11.270 --> 02:00:11.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:17.189 --> 02:00:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:18.310 --> 02:00:18.320 align:start position:0%
i don't
 
02:00:19.589 --> 02:00:19.599 align:start position:0%
i haven't thought about it that way i'm
 
02:00:21.030 --> 02:00:21.040 align:start position:0%
just going to be completely frank so
 
02:00:23.910 --> 02:00:23.920 align:start position:0%
maybe frank was better perfectly is
 
02:00:25.750 --> 02:00:25.760 align:start position:0%
better so frank's in the other committee
 
02:00:27.669 --> 02:00:27.679 align:start position:0%
but okay in the other committee not here
 
02:00:29.270 --> 02:00:29.280 align:start position:0%
i had not thought about it that way i
 
02:00:31.109 --> 02:00:31.119 align:start position:0%
mean i i am open
 
02:00:33.830 --> 02:00:33.840 align:start position:0%
um i i'm open to changes i just want to
 
02:00:36.310 --> 02:00:36.320 align:start position:0%
you know my ultimate goal here is i know
 
02:00:39.030 --> 02:00:39.040 align:start position:0%
it's a big task but it is it is worth
 
02:00:41.910 --> 02:00:41.920 align:start position:0%
doing and we have questions i mean i i
 
02:00:43.430 --> 02:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
tried to do this a different way and
 
02:00:46.229 --> 02:00:46.239 align:start position:0%
came down really on having us a
 
02:00:48.790 --> 02:00:48.800 align:start position:0%
commission so that we could you know we
 
02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:49.830 align:start position:0%
commission so that we could you know we
could

02:00:49.830 --> 02:00:49.840 align:start position:0%
could
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
spend our time do the do the work that
 
02:00:54.470 --> 02:00:54.480 align:start position:0%
we need answer these questions and then
 
02:00:57.990 --> 02:00:58.000 align:start position:0%
be completely you know completely clear
 
02:00:59.669 --> 02:00:59.679 align:start position:0%
because we're not right now
 
02:01:01.350 --> 02:01:01.360 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan what's
 
02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:02.310 align:start position:0%
representative sullivan what's
interesting

02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
interesting
 
02:01:04.550 --> 02:01:04.560 align:start position:0%
you've got the chairman
 
02:01:07.030 --> 02:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
of this committee and the chairman of
 
02:01:08.950 --> 02:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
oversight talking to himself at the
 
02:01:08.960 --> 02:01:09.910 align:start position:0%
oversight talking to himself at the
moment

02:01:09.910 --> 02:01:09.920 align:start position:0%
moment
 
02:01:09.920 --> 02:01:10.870 align:start position:0%
moment
and

02:01:10.870 --> 02:01:10.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:01:13.350 --> 02:01:13.360 align:start position:0%
his conclusion is that let's run with
 
02:01:15.189 --> 02:01:15.199 align:start position:0%
what's being established here and one of
 
02:01:17.270 --> 02:01:17.280 align:start position:0%
the things they may conclude
 
02:01:19.589 --> 02:01:19.599 align:start position:0%
is wouldn't they like to
 
02:01:28.310 --> 02:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
02:01:31.270 --> 02:01:31.280 align:start position:0%
okay representative gay
 
02:01:32.629 --> 02:01:32.639 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
02:01:33.990 --> 02:01:34.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me
 
02:01:36.310 --> 02:01:36.320 align:start position:0%
i'm really impressed with the scope of
 
02:01:38.550 --> 02:01:38.560 align:start position:0%
the people that you have put
 
02:01:41.910 --> 02:01:41.920 align:start position:0%
suggested be on this commission i'm
 
02:01:44.470 --> 02:01:44.480 align:start position:0%
really um
 
02:01:47.030 --> 02:01:47.040 align:start position:0%
i would want to maintain whatever is
 
02:01:50.390 --> 02:01:50.400 align:start position:0%
done includes this wide arena
 
02:01:51.589 --> 02:01:51.599 align:start position:0%
like you said
 
02:01:54.950 --> 02:01:54.960 align:start position:0%
it's open and inclusive because as you
 
02:01:58.550 --> 02:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
said some some of the organizations are
 
02:01:59.589 --> 02:01:59.599 align:start position:0%
much more
 
02:02:02.229 --> 02:02:02.239 align:start position:0%
large and powerful and others are very
 
02:02:05.189 --> 02:02:05.199 align:start position:0%
small and if they
 
02:02:07.109 --> 02:02:07.119 align:start position:0%
in order to be effective
 
02:02:08.470 --> 02:02:08.480 align:start position:0%
there has to be really good
 
02:02:11.990 --> 02:02:12.000 align:start position:0%
communication avenues and sometimes if
 
02:02:14.229 --> 02:02:14.239 align:start position:0%
you don't establish
 
02:02:16.550 --> 02:02:16.560 align:start position:0%
you know everybody's okay to email each
 
02:02:19.030 --> 02:02:19.040 align:start position:0%
other here's the list you can do free
 
02:02:22.709 --> 02:02:22.719 align:start position:0%
exchange of ideas if it just turns into
 
02:02:24.629 --> 02:02:24.639 align:start position:0%
uh we're gonna have a meeting
 
02:02:26.950 --> 02:02:26.960 align:start position:0%
a meeting we'll point something we'll
 
02:02:29.830 --> 02:02:29.840 align:start position:0%
make a report that's not ongoing so i
 
02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:31.510 align:start position:0%
make a report that's not ongoing so i
like

02:02:31.510 --> 02:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
02:02:33.589 --> 02:02:33.599 align:start position:0%
i i i
 
02:02:34.709 --> 02:02:34.719 align:start position:0%
i don't know how to say would you
 
02:02:36.790 --> 02:02:36.800 align:start position:0%
believe in this connection
 
02:02:38.470 --> 02:02:38.480 align:start position:0%
would you believe it hilarity said
 
02:02:40.229 --> 02:02:40.239 align:start position:0%
honestly but now now i'm going to use
 
02:02:42.149 --> 02:02:42.159 align:start position:0%
frankly okay
 
02:02:45.109 --> 02:02:45.119 align:start position:0%
well frankly frankly i i like really
 
02:02:47.109 --> 02:02:47.119 align:start position:0%
like the idea and i'm trying to figure
 
02:02:48.629 --> 02:02:48.639 align:start position:0%
out how
 
02:02:51.830 --> 02:02:51.840 align:start position:0%
we make sure that it's ongoing
 
02:02:54.470 --> 02:02:54.480 align:start position:0%
and that it's accessible
 
02:02:54.480 --> 02:02:55.510 align:start position:0%
and that it's accessible
um

02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:02:55.520 --> 02:02:56.470 align:start position:0%
um
and

02:02:56.470 --> 02:02:56.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:02:58.149 --> 02:02:58.159 align:start position:0%
even though it seems like it would make
 
02:03:00.310 --> 02:03:00.320 align:start position:0%
sense what do you think here that's a
 
02:03:02.149 --> 02:03:02.159 align:start position:0%
good one what do you think
 
02:03:03.589 --> 02:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
if we put it
 
02:03:08.229 --> 02:03:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:10.550 --> 02:03:10.560 align:start position:0%
i can't make this into a sentence i'm
 
02:03:12.709 --> 02:03:12.719 align:start position:0%
asking her here's my idea how do you
 
02:03:14.950 --> 02:03:14.960 align:start position:0%
feel about it and just to put it as a
 
02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:16.390 align:start position:0%
feel about it and just to put it as a
subsidiary

02:03:16.390 --> 02:03:16.400 align:start position:0%
subsidiary
 
02:03:19.510 --> 02:03:19.520 align:start position:0%
subsidiary on your commission
 
02:03:21.750 --> 02:03:21.760 align:start position:0%
that might change who's on it
 
02:03:21.760 --> 02:03:22.629 align:start position:0%
that might change who's on it
so

02:03:22.629 --> 02:03:22.639 align:start position:0%
so
 
02:03:25.750 --> 02:03:25.760 align:start position:0%
i'm thinking let them figure out how to
 
02:03:28.550 --> 02:03:28.560 align:start position:0%
how to keep on going because it's not
 
02:03:30.149 --> 02:03:30.159 align:start position:0%
just oh we're going to check out all
 
02:03:32.870 --> 02:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
this it's like how do we make a really
 
02:03:35.189 --> 02:03:35.199 align:start position:0%
good response team for whatever's
 
02:03:35.199 --> 02:03:37.270 align:start position:0%
good response team for whatever's
happening

02:03:37.270 --> 02:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
happening
 
02:03:38.870 --> 02:03:38.880 align:start position:0%
how do we build a real you know a
 
02:03:41.109 --> 02:03:41.119 align:start position:0%
consistent reliable backbone i think
 
02:03:42.550 --> 02:03:42.560 align:start position:0%
about it but you know backbone
 
02:03:44.390 --> 02:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
infrastructure's a word we use a lot but
 
02:03:46.950 --> 02:03:46.960 align:start position:0%
really four-part for public health in
 
02:03:48.550 --> 02:03:48.560 align:start position:0%
this state for public health delivery
 
02:03:51.189 --> 02:03:51.199 align:start position:0%
systems and that's you know that is
 
02:03:53.270 --> 02:03:53.280 align:start position:0%
what's embedded in here and it's gonna
 
02:03:56.069 --> 02:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
and there i mean i i will say that it
 
02:03:57.189 --> 02:03:57.199 align:start position:0%
was hard
 
02:03:59.510 --> 02:03:59.520 align:start position:0%
to prescribe the membership for this
 
02:04:01.350 --> 02:04:01.360 align:start position:0%
because there were so many people
 
02:04:04.550 --> 02:04:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:06.229 --> 02:04:06.239 align:start position:0%
13 public health networks need to be
 
02:04:08.709 --> 02:04:08.719 align:start position:0%
represented and they can bring about who
 
02:04:12.950 --> 02:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
they want to put their um i
 
02:04:14.470 --> 02:04:14.480 align:start position:0%
who they want to have represent them
 
02:04:16.310 --> 02:04:16.320 align:start position:0%
it's important and i've i've talked with
 
02:04:17.669 --> 02:04:17.679 align:start position:0%
other groups who've called me and said
 
02:04:19.830 --> 02:04:19.840 align:start position:0%
you know gi how come my group isn't in
 
02:04:22.069 --> 02:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
this and i said you these are public
 
02:04:24.149 --> 02:04:24.159 align:start position:0%
meetings this is open you are welcome
 
02:04:26.069 --> 02:04:26.079 align:start position:0%
and part of what i was on a commission
 
02:04:27.669 --> 02:04:27.679 align:start position:0%
once when i worked in emergency medical
 
02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:30.400 align:start position:0%
services i was appointed to a commission
 
02:04:32.310 --> 02:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
to put automatic external defibrillators
 
02:04:34.950 --> 02:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
in all public schools so we had a mix of
 
02:04:36.550 --> 02:04:36.560 align:start position:0%
legislators and different folks from
 
02:04:39.669 --> 02:04:39.679 align:start position:0%
health care and public safety and that's
 
02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
part we were very deliberate about the
 
02:04:44.550 --> 02:04:44.560 align:start position:0%
transparency in the meetings and making
 
02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:46.880 align:start position:0%
sure not just who we had prescribed at
 
02:04:48.229 --> 02:04:48.239 align:start position:0%
the table but
 
02:04:50.390 --> 02:04:50.400 align:start position:0%
as questions developed and as we started
 
02:04:53.589 --> 02:04:53.599 align:start position:0%
to go down certain to certain avenues
 
02:04:55.189 --> 02:04:55.199 align:start position:0%
you know working through certain ideas
 
02:04:56.629 --> 02:04:56.639 align:start position:0%
we would make sure to invite the right
 
02:04:58.950 --> 02:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
you know people to be there
 
02:05:01.510 --> 02:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
and so that could as this all takes
 
02:05:01.520 --> 02:05:02.629 align:start position:0%
and so that could as this all takes
place

02:05:02.629 --> 02:05:02.639 align:start position:0%
place
 
02:05:04.310 --> 02:05:04.320 align:start position:0%
either make this
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
i don't want to say larger because that
 
02:05:07.669 --> 02:05:07.679 align:start position:0%
that it is inclusive we can be inclusive
 
02:05:09.589 --> 02:05:09.599 align:start position:0%
without all of the names but it could
 
02:05:11.350 --> 02:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
you know broaden the group that's in
 
02:05:13.830 --> 02:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
involved in this um rather than draw it
 
02:05:15.830 --> 02:05:15.840 align:start position:0%
back that's yet to be seen so i hope
 
02:05:17.270 --> 02:05:17.280 align:start position:0%
that that helps
 
02:05:20.390 --> 02:05:20.400 align:start position:0%
um i think that i hope that that helps
 
02:05:22.790 --> 02:05:22.800 align:start position:0%
with your question and any worry that
 
02:05:24.709 --> 02:05:24.719 align:start position:0%
you might have
 
02:05:27.830 --> 02:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
have you a senator in mind who might be
 
02:05:32.830 --> 02:05:32.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:34.709 --> 02:05:34.719 align:start position:0%
frankly no
 
02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:35.450 align:start position:0%
keep lying
 
02:05:35.450 --> 02:05:38.069 align:start position:0%
keep lying
[Laughter]

02:05:38.069 --> 02:05:38.079 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
02:05:40.550 --> 02:05:40.560 align:start position:0%
yeah yes yes that's all i ask and do you
 
02:05:42.790 --> 02:05:42.800 align:start position:0%
have a representative
 
02:05:44.950 --> 02:05:44.960 align:start position:0%
not at this moment okay because is the
 
02:05:47.430 --> 02:05:47.440 align:start position:0%
one that has to go scout all of these
 
02:05:50.069 --> 02:05:50.079 align:start position:0%
things this has become a requirement now
 
02:05:51.669 --> 02:05:51.679 align:start position:0%
would you like to
 
02:05:51.679 --> 02:05:52.470 align:start position:0%
would you like to
maybe

02:05:52.470 --> 02:05:52.480 align:start position:0%
maybe
 
02:05:55.030 --> 02:05:55.040 align:start position:0%
answer the question again do you have a
 
02:05:59.030 --> 02:05:59.040 align:start position:0%
representative in mind i would
 
02:06:01.350 --> 02:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
i work with representative merchant he
 
02:06:02.709 --> 02:06:02.719 align:start position:0%
has been a strong voice for public
 
02:06:05.910 --> 02:06:05.920 align:start position:0%
health in the connecticut river valley
 
02:06:08.310 --> 02:06:08.320 align:start position:0%
and it would be
 
02:06:10.310 --> 02:06:10.320 align:start position:0%
it would be it would be wonderful to
 
02:06:12.310 --> 02:06:12.320 align:start position:0%
have his expertise
 
02:06:13.270 --> 02:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
on the team
 
02:06:14.950 --> 02:06:14.960 align:start position:0%
the chair recommends to the speaker of
 
02:06:16.550 --> 02:06:16.560 align:start position:0%
the house that if this bill passes
 
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
representative merchant and
 
02:06:20.709 --> 02:06:20.719 align:start position:0%
the one that we all know is the senator
 
02:06:22.069 --> 02:06:22.079 align:start position:0%
will be appointed thank you other
 
02:06:22.079 --> 02:06:23.270 align:start position:0%
will be appointed thank you other
questions

02:06:23.270 --> 02:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
questions
 
02:06:25.030 --> 02:06:25.040 align:start position:0%
i just want more of a comment than a
 
02:06:26.709 --> 02:06:26.719 align:start position:0%
question are you you making i just want
 
02:06:28.310 --> 02:06:28.320 align:start position:0%
to say thank you to representative
 
02:06:30.629 --> 02:06:30.639 align:start position:0%
apprentice it'd be a privilege to work
 
02:06:32.149 --> 02:06:32.159 align:start position:0%
with you in this commission
 
02:06:33.750 --> 02:06:33.760 align:start position:0%
my other question i guess is when i
 
02:06:36.069 --> 02:06:36.079 align:start position:0%
think about how this is being structured
 
02:06:38.310 --> 02:06:38.320 align:start position:0%
in the world of medicine in a lot of
 
02:06:39.830 --> 02:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
other professions we always talk about
 
02:06:41.270 --> 02:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
best practice
 
02:06:43.669 --> 02:06:43.679 align:start position:0%
and what i would say is in my time in
 
02:06:45.430 --> 02:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
talking working with a hospital to
 
02:06:47.830 --> 02:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
pharmacy areas which is my expertise
 
02:06:49.830 --> 02:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
when we pull people together from 14
 
02:06:51.510 --> 02:06:51.520 align:start position:0%
different hospitals
 
02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:53.360 align:start position:0%
we learn from each other
 
02:06:55.189 --> 02:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
and we learned from that process to
 
02:06:57.189 --> 02:06:57.199 align:start position:0%
identify the best practice or things
 
02:06:59.430 --> 02:06:59.440 align:start position:0%
that they were doing that we could take
 
02:07:01.030 --> 02:07:01.040 align:start position:0%
and try to emulate within our own
 
02:07:01.040 --> 02:07:02.390 align:start position:0%
and try to emulate within our own
organizations

02:07:02.390 --> 02:07:02.400 align:start position:0%
organizations
 
02:07:04.629 --> 02:07:04.639 align:start position:0%
so and i look at this as an opportunity
 
02:07:06.790 --> 02:07:06.800 align:start position:0%
for people to come together
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
and at that point in time talk about how
 
02:07:10.709 --> 02:07:10.719 align:start position:0%
they're doing things and then learn from
 
02:07:12.709 --> 02:07:12.719 align:start position:0%
each other it's a learning tank if you
 
02:07:12.719 --> 02:07:13.510 align:start position:0%
each other it's a learning tank if you
will

02:07:13.510 --> 02:07:13.520 align:start position:0%
will
 
02:07:15.669 --> 02:07:15.679 align:start position:0%
and at that point in time try to help
 
02:07:18.149 --> 02:07:18.159 align:start position:0%
develop best practices or best practices
 
02:07:21.589 --> 02:07:21.599 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:21.599 --> 02:07:23.109 align:start position:0%
 
yes

02:07:23.109 --> 02:07:23.119 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:07:25.030 --> 02:07:25.040 align:start position:0%
that was a great question
 
02:07:27.030 --> 02:07:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative folsom
 
02:07:28.470 --> 02:07:28.480 align:start position:0%
since it seems we're waiting for an
 
02:07:31.189 --> 02:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
amendment to show up um i'll just put my
 
02:07:34.550 --> 02:07:34.560 align:start position:0%
two cents in make it a nickel yeah
 
02:07:39.270 --> 02:07:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
i would hope or i'm hoping you are
 
02:07:41.840 --> 02:07:42.950 align:start position:0%
i would hope or i'm hoping you are
planning

02:07:42.950 --> 02:07:42.960 align:start position:0%
planning
 
02:07:46.540 --> 02:07:46.550 align:start position:0%
to allow um these regional
 
02:07:46.550 --> 02:07:48.629 align:start position:0%
to allow um these regional
[Music]

02:07:48.629 --> 02:07:48.639 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:07:52.830 --> 02:07:52.840 align:start position:0%
uh organizations to retain their
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
regional flavor
 
02:07:55.840 --> 02:07:56.870 align:start position:0%
regional flavor
um

02:07:56.870 --> 02:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:07:58.790 --> 02:07:58.800 align:start position:0%
you know i
 
02:08:01.270 --> 02:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
my concern is
 
02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:02.149 align:start position:0%
my concern is
that

02:08:02.149 --> 02:08:02.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:08:04.790 --> 02:08:04.800 align:start position:0%
in this attempt to
 
02:08:07.830 --> 02:08:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:10.709 --> 02:08:10.719 align:start position:0%
too much all the same when we have such
 
02:08:10.719 --> 02:08:12.069 align:start position:0%
too much all the same when we have such
different

02:08:12.069 --> 02:08:12.079 align:start position:0%
different
 
02:08:12.079 --> 02:08:13.109 align:start position:0%
different
um

02:08:13.109 --> 02:08:13.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:08:15.910 --> 02:08:15.920 align:start position:0%
different communities across the state
 
02:08:19.910 --> 02:08:19.920 align:start position:0%
so my question is are you hoping to
 
02:08:23.669 --> 02:08:23.679 align:start position:0%
um allow the different flavors uh and
 
02:08:26.229 --> 02:08:26.239 align:start position:0%
cultures of our different uh counties
 
02:08:28.149 --> 02:08:28.159 align:start position:0%
and regions to remain
 
02:08:30.629 --> 02:08:30.639 align:start position:0%
a part of the process
 
02:08:31.430 --> 02:08:31.440 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
02:08:33.430 --> 02:08:33.440 align:start position:0%
representative folsom and i think that's
 
02:08:35.189 --> 02:08:35.199 align:start position:0%
that's key to all of this there are some
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
things that you know there's like a
 
02:08:38.950 --> 02:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
floor and there's a ceiling
 
02:08:40.870 --> 02:08:40.880 align:start position:0%
but when it comes to public you know in
 
02:08:42.629 --> 02:08:42.639 align:start position:0%
term there's a floor and there's a
 
02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:44.960 align:start position:0%
ceiling when it comes to public health
 
02:08:46.470 --> 02:08:46.480 align:start position:0%
and i talked about this a little bit
 
02:08:48.790 --> 02:08:48.800 align:start position:0%
during my testimony in one part of the
 
02:08:51.430 --> 02:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
state we might have an you know an issue
 
02:08:54.709 --> 02:08:54.719 align:start position:0%
with um you know child passenger safety
 
02:08:57.589 --> 02:08:57.599 align:start position:0%
and we need to address that or you know
 
02:08:59.910 --> 02:08:59.920 align:start position:0%
or obesity that needs to be addressed
 
02:09:01.350 --> 02:09:01.360 align:start position:0%
that's you know
 
02:09:04.229 --> 02:09:04.239 align:start position:0%
come coming forward in higher rates of
 
02:09:06.470 --> 02:09:06.480 align:start position:0%
you know type 1 and type 2 diabetes you
 
02:09:09.830 --> 02:09:09.840 align:start position:0%
know there so there's an issue that that
 
02:09:10.950 --> 02:09:10.960 align:start position:0%
public health
 
02:09:13.669 --> 02:09:13.679 align:start position:0%
community has said we need to focus some
 
02:09:15.109 --> 02:09:15.119 align:start position:0%
time and efforts on this because this is
 
02:09:16.870 --> 02:09:16.880 align:start position:0%
really threatening the well-being that
 
02:09:18.390 --> 02:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
sounds like a strong word it is you're
 
02:09:19.830 --> 02:09:19.840 align:start position:0%
gonna it's impacting the well-being of
 
02:09:21.830 --> 02:09:21.840 align:start position:0%
our community of our communities that we
 
02:09:24.229 --> 02:09:24.239 align:start position:0%
serve together so let's address this so
 
02:09:27.030 --> 02:09:27.040 align:start position:0%
there is there should be the room for
 
02:09:29.510 --> 02:09:29.520 align:start position:0%
that and as it is now
 
02:09:32.149 --> 02:09:32.159 align:start position:0%
yes but what you know there's not this
 
02:09:34.550 --> 02:09:34.560 align:start position:0%
is a formal but informal structure that
 
02:09:34.560 --> 02:09:35.589 align:start position:0%
is a formal but informal structure that
needs

02:09:35.589 --> 02:09:35.599 align:start position:0%
needs
 
02:09:37.990 --> 02:09:38.000 align:start position:0%
i believe more of a form formal
 
02:09:40.310 --> 02:09:40.320 align:start position:0%
recognition i believe that i believe
 
02:09:42.629 --> 02:09:42.639 align:start position:0%
that you know it needs to be codified
 
02:09:44.310 --> 02:09:44.320 align:start position:0%
but those are the questions that others
 
02:09:45.910 --> 02:09:45.920 align:start position:0%
are going to answer and make decisions
 
02:09:48.229 --> 02:09:48.239 align:start position:0%
about what they want to do so directly
 
02:09:48.239 --> 02:09:49.030 align:start position:0%
about what they want to do so directly
yes

02:09:49.030 --> 02:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
yes
 
02:09:50.950 --> 02:09:50.960 align:start position:0%
we will not lose the local flavor that
 
02:09:52.950 --> 02:09:52.960 align:start position:0%
would be the point of it we'll see and
 
02:09:54.310 --> 02:09:54.320 align:start position:0%
and the rest will be answered by this
 
02:10:06.709 --> 02:10:06.719 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:09.750 --> 02:10:09.760 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions
 
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:11.280 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't have brought a question in
 
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
from the outside would you have
 
02:10:14.550 --> 02:10:14.560 align:start position:0%
represented nader no you didn't didn't
 
02:10:16.229 --> 02:10:16.239 align:start position:0%
go get one all right
 
02:10:18.950 --> 02:10:18.960 align:start position:0%
thank you senator
 
02:10:21.510 --> 02:10:21.520 align:start position:0%
well we've got 10 15 minutes and this

federal and state level upon request we

clarify the process will not expand the

data set that we already share and most
 
02:31:31.910 --> 02:31:31.920 align:start position:0%
importantly uphold the strongest and

representative from
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
the department of safety a former
 
02:32:12.389 --> 02:32:12.399 align:start position:0%
colleague of mine um who's the direct

assistant director at fire standard
 
02:32:16.230 --> 02:32:16.240 align:start position:0%
training ems jeffrey phillips um and we
 
02:32:17.830 --> 02:32:17.840 align:start position:0%
actually worked together during the time
 
02:32:19.429 --> 02:32:19.439 align:start position:0%
when we built the system that we're
 
02:32:22.150 --> 02:32:22.160 align:start position:0%
talking about now and i just if i may
 
02:32:23.830 --> 02:32:23.840 align:start position:0%
for a moment um chair members of the
 
02:32:26.150 --> 02:32:26.160 align:start position:0%
committee we have robust data that's
 
02:32:28.070 --> 02:32:28.080 align:start position:0%
available to us and again we were we
 
02:32:30.309 --> 02:32:30.319 align:start position:0%
were early birds in this system we were
 
02:32:32.150 --> 02:32:32.160 align:start position:0%
doing electronic patient care reporting
 
02:32:33.750 --> 02:32:33.760 align:start position:0%
with the strictest confidentiality
 
02:32:33.760 --> 02:32:34.870 align:start position:0%
with the strictest confidentiality
standards

02:32:34.870 --> 02:32:34.880 align:start position:0%
standards
 
02:32:37.590 --> 02:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
before some hospitals had moved from
 
02:32:41.030 --> 02:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
paper to elect electronic systems
 
02:32:43.670 --> 02:32:43.680 align:start position:0%
it's important for us to be able to to
 
02:32:45.510 --> 02:32:45.520 align:start position:0%
look at this data and continuously
 
02:32:47.510 --> 02:32:47.520 align:start position:0%
improve the work that we do our patient
 
02:32:49.349 --> 02:32:49.359 align:start position:0%
care protocols for how we might be
 
02:32:51.750 --> 02:32:51.760 align:start position:0%
providing a certain kind of medication
 
02:32:54.950 --> 02:32:54.960 align:start position:0%
uh are people um in would a certain type
 
02:32:56.950 --> 02:32:56.960 align:start position:0%
of splinting is that still the best way
 
02:32:58.230 --> 02:32:58.240 align:start position:0%
to splint
 
02:33:00.309 --> 02:33:00.319 align:start position:0%
there are all these questions
 
02:33:00.319 --> 02:33:01.110 align:start position:0%
there are all these questions
that

02:33:01.110 --> 02:33:01.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
02:33:03.750 --> 02:33:03.760 align:start position:0%
need to get answered and using this data
 
02:33:06.309 --> 02:33:06.319 align:start position:0%
is how that gets done but we don't have
 
02:33:08.150 --> 02:33:08.160 align:start position:0%
the internal capabilities to do that
 
02:33:10.150 --> 02:33:10.160 align:start position:0%
we're honest about it and we're i mean
 
02:33:11.670 --> 02:33:11.680 align:start position:0%
we can answer some questions but we're
 
02:33:11.680 --> 02:33:13.349 align:start position:0%
we can answer some questions but we're
approached

02:33:13.349 --> 02:33:13.359 align:start position:0%
approached
 
02:33:15.590 --> 02:33:15.600 align:start position:0%
sometimes by groups like an academic
 
02:33:17.510 --> 02:33:17.520 align:start position:0%
medical center say here in new hampshire
 
02:33:19.349 --> 02:33:19.359 align:start position:0%
or another state agency that wants to
 
02:33:21.590 --> 02:33:21.600 align:start position:0%
look at the data to answer a question
 
02:33:23.750 --> 02:33:23.760 align:start position:0%
and that's going to help them as well as
 
02:33:25.349 --> 02:33:25.359 align:start position:0%
help us so that's why i bring this
 
02:33:28.550 --> 02:33:28.560 align:start position:0%
before you today thank you any questions
 
02:33:33.110 --> 02:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:35.510 --> 02:33:35.520 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
02:33:37.110 --> 02:33:37.120 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and thank you senator
 
02:33:38.870 --> 02:33:38.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question uh
 
02:33:40.469 --> 02:33:40.479 align:start position:0%
in terms of the
 
02:33:43.349 --> 02:33:43.359 align:start position:0%
uh as mentioned here the the privacy
 
02:33:45.590 --> 02:33:45.600 align:start position:0%
committee shall review this is how this
 
02:33:46.550 --> 02:33:46.560 align:start position:0%
is handled
 
02:33:48.790 --> 02:33:48.800 align:start position:0%
how would that interface with the
 
02:33:50.150 --> 02:33:50.160 align:start position:0%
current bills that are going through the
 
02:33:52.389 --> 02:33:52.399 align:start position:0%
house and the senate relative to the
 
02:33:54.389 --> 02:33:54.399 align:start position:0%
internal structure
 
02:33:57.510 --> 02:33:57.520 align:start position:0%
uh to deal with the privacy and handling
 
02:34:00.150 --> 02:34:00.160 align:start position:0%
of data internally would this privacy
 
02:34:03.190 --> 02:34:03.200 align:start position:0%
committee be part of that or would the
 
02:34:05.270 --> 02:34:05.280 align:start position:0%
senate bill that's going through
 
02:34:06.790 --> 02:34:06.800 align:start position:0%
supersede that or
 
02:34:08.790 --> 02:34:08.800 align:start position:0%
how would they interface
 
02:34:10.070 --> 02:34:10.080 align:start position:0%
i don't believe that thank you for the
 
02:34:11.830 --> 02:34:11.840 align:start position:0%
question um
 
02:34:13.270 --> 02:34:13.280 align:start position:0%
it's not
 
02:34:15.510 --> 02:34:15.520 align:start position:0%
to my knowledge they don't interface
 
02:34:17.590 --> 02:34:17.600 align:start position:0%
this privacy committee came up
 
02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:20.160 align:start position:0%
uh was put into statute it was actually
 
02:34:21.590 --> 02:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
after i left the department of safety
 
02:34:23.270 --> 02:34:23.280 align:start position:0%
but i think that it's really strong work
 
02:34:25.750 --> 02:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
on their part has a broad constituency
 
02:34:27.990 --> 02:34:28.000 align:start position:0%
and a structure for reviewing these
 
02:34:29.830 --> 02:34:29.840 align:start position:0%
requests and making sure that the
 
02:34:32.150 --> 02:34:32.160 align:start position:0%
privacy is i mean we have the strictest
 
02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:33.510 align:start position:0%
privacy is i mean we have the strictest
standards

02:34:33.510 --> 02:34:33.520 align:start position:0%
standards
 
02:34:35.190 --> 02:34:35.200 align:start position:0%
with the systems that we use but it
 
02:34:36.550 --> 02:34:36.560 align:start position:0%
makes sure that it's meeting those
 
02:34:38.790 --> 02:34:38.800 align:start position:0%
standards and that's where the final nod
 
02:34:40.469 --> 02:34:40.479 align:start position:0%
comes before the commissioner takes it
 
02:34:40.479 --> 02:34:57.110 align:start position:0%
comes before the commissioner takes it
over

02:34:57.110 --> 02:34:57.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:00.790 --> 02:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
um um privacy committee then follow
 
02:35:03.429 --> 02:35:03.439 align:start position:0%
under the um purview of
 
02:35:06.070 --> 02:35:06.080 align:start position:0%
this new structure that's being uh
 
02:35:08.550 --> 02:35:08.560 align:start position:0%
propounded by senate bill
 
02:35:10.830 --> 02:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
i forgot the number of
 
02:35:13.110 --> 02:35:13.120 align:start position:0%
423 uh such that
 
02:35:16.710 --> 02:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
um and house bill 1662 sorry
 
02:35:16.720 --> 02:35:19.110 align:start position:0%
um and house bill 1662 sorry
um

02:35:19.110 --> 02:35:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
02:35:21.270 --> 02:35:21.280 align:start position:0%
would would they would that
 
02:35:23.990 --> 02:35:24.000 align:start position:0%
how how would that flow uh because it's
 
02:35:26.309 --> 02:35:26.319 align:start position:0%
really important it's important from
 
02:35:28.870 --> 02:35:28.880 align:start position:0%
several perspective privacy but also i
 
02:35:30.710 --> 02:35:30.720 align:start position:0%
think one of the
 
02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
real important parts of house bill 1662
 
02:35:36.389 --> 02:35:36.399 align:start position:0%
is is to avoid hacking issues
 
02:35:39.590 --> 02:35:39.600 align:start position:0%
if the if it's structured but i'm
 
02:35:41.830 --> 02:35:41.840 align:start position:0%
concerned that there would be one
 
02:35:41.840 --> 02:35:43.190 align:start position:0%
concerned that there would be one
committee

02:35:43.190 --> 02:35:43.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
02:35:45.750 --> 02:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
off by itself and then another committee
 
02:35:47.910 --> 02:35:47.920 align:start position:0%
looking at it differently
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
give a point of information on that you
 
02:35:51.990 --> 02:35:52.000 align:start position:0%
may 1662 has only to do with the
 
02:35:53.510 --> 02:35:53.520 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
02:35:55.110 --> 02:35:55.120 align:start position:0%
that is an internal policy thing for
 
02:35:57.510 --> 02:35:57.520 align:start position:0%
dhhs this is department of safety so
 
02:35:59.750 --> 02:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
there's no interaction between those two
 
02:36:00.870 --> 02:36:00.880 align:start position:0%
so don't have to i saw you're starting
 
02:36:02.309 --> 02:36:02.319 align:start position:0%
to look it up
 
02:36:05.190 --> 02:36:05.200 align:start position:0%
yeah no don't worry 1662 is for dhhs
 
02:36:06.550 --> 02:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
this is their department of safety they
 
02:36:10.630 --> 02:36:10.640 align:start position:0%
do not intersperse their inner interplay
 
02:36:14.389 --> 02:36:14.399 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:15.990 --> 02:36:16.000 align:start position:0%
representative knurk yes i did have a
 
02:36:18.150 --> 02:36:18.160 align:start position:0%
question as well and that is okay um the
 
02:36:19.510 --> 02:36:19.520 align:start position:0%
data that's being shared is it
 
02:36:19.520 --> 02:36:21.030 align:start position:0%
data that's being shared is it
de-identified

02:36:21.030 --> 02:36:21.040 align:start position:0%
de-identified
 
02:36:24.790 --> 02:36:24.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:27.830 --> 02:36:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative acton
 
02:36:29.349 --> 02:36:29.359 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you
 
02:36:29.359 --> 02:36:30.469 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair and uh thank you
senator

02:36:30.469 --> 02:36:30.479 align:start position:0%
senator
 
02:36:33.270 --> 02:36:33.280 align:start position:0%
um i'm on the opiate abatement advisory
 
02:36:35.429 --> 02:36:35.439 align:start position:0%
commission and we receive information
 
02:36:36.389 --> 02:36:36.399 align:start position:0%
back from
 
02:36:38.070 --> 02:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
from emts
 
02:36:40.870 --> 02:36:40.880 align:start position:0%
regularly on what's going on
 
02:36:43.190 --> 02:36:43.200 align:start position:0%
on the street level and things rapidly
 
02:36:45.190 --> 02:36:45.200 align:start position:0%
changing uh like for instance we found
 
02:36:46.550 --> 02:36:46.560 align:start position:0%
out that that
 
02:36:48.950 --> 02:36:48.960 align:start position:0%
fentanyl is being mixed with xylazine
 
02:36:51.349 --> 02:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
which is a horse tranquilizer
 
02:36:55.270 --> 02:36:55.280 align:start position:0%
and does not respond to narcan
 
02:36:57.750 --> 02:36:57.760 align:start position:0%
so this type of information coming back
 
02:36:59.670 --> 02:36:59.680 align:start position:0%
up from the street is vital is this
 
02:37:01.110 --> 02:37:01.120 align:start position:0%
information that would be covered in
 
02:37:02.950 --> 02:37:02.960 align:start position:0%
this type of uh
 
02:37:06.710 --> 02:37:06.720 align:start position:0%
in this situation
 
02:37:07.830 --> 02:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question uh
 
02:37:09.910 --> 02:37:09.920 align:start position:0%
representative acton so you're you're
 
02:37:11.830 --> 02:37:11.840 align:start position:0%
actually already getting data from this
 
02:37:13.670 --> 02:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
data set and using it within the state
 
02:37:16.070 --> 02:37:16.080 align:start position:0%
system that's structured so the data
 
02:37:18.070 --> 02:37:18.080 align:start position:0%
that you're receiving and reviewing is
 
02:37:19.990 --> 02:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
coming from it's called tempsis the
 
02:37:22.469 --> 02:37:22.479 align:start position:0%
trauma and emergency medical services
 
02:37:25.190 --> 02:37:25.200 align:start position:0%
information system so that is
 
02:37:27.429 --> 02:37:27.439 align:start position:0%
what new hampshire has built for its
 
02:37:29.349 --> 02:37:29.359 align:start position:0%
reporting structure so when there are
 
02:37:32.150 --> 02:37:32.160 align:start position:0%
questions about you know routinely you
 
02:37:34.150 --> 02:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
know how you know how much was narcan
 
02:37:35.830 --> 02:37:35.840 align:start position:0%
this is how much was narcan used in the
 
02:37:38.950 --> 02:37:38.960 align:start position:0%
last week that report can be generated
 
02:37:40.389 --> 02:37:40.399 align:start position:0%
at the state level
 
02:37:43.030 --> 02:37:43.040 align:start position:0%
based on the input of the ems
 
02:37:44.630 --> 02:37:44.640 align:start position:0%
professionals throughout the state
 
02:37:46.469 --> 02:37:46.479 align:start position:0%
during that time period
 
02:37:49.190 --> 02:37:49.200 align:start position:0%
so it is uh that's already covered okay
 
02:37:52.630 --> 02:37:52.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:37:54.550 --> 02:37:54.560 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you
 
02:37:54.560 --> 02:37:56.870 align:start position:0%
seeing no further questions thank you

which is part of the department of

02:38:21.510 --> 02:38:21.520 align:start position:0%
safety
 
02:38:22.950 --> 02:38:22.960 align:start position:0%
uh we are in support of this bill and
 
02:38:24.469 --> 02:38:24.479 align:start position:0%
would like to offer a few comments and
 
02:38:25.990 --> 02:38:26.000 align:start position:0%
then answer any questions that you may
 
02:38:26.000 --> 02:38:27.429 align:start position:0%
then answer any questions that you may
have

02:38:27.429 --> 02:38:27.439 align:start position:0%
have
 
02:38:30.309 --> 02:38:30.319 align:start position:0%
as senator apprentice said before
 
02:38:33.349 --> 02:38:33.359 align:start position:0%
we house a statewide
 
02:38:35.990 --> 02:38:36.000 align:start position:0%
ems patient care reporting system so all
 
02:38:39.270 --> 02:38:39.280 align:start position:0%
emts there's approximately 5700 emts in
 
02:38:40.469 --> 02:38:40.479 align:start position:0%
the state
 
02:38:43.110 --> 02:38:43.120 align:start position:0%
report to the department of safety uh
 
02:38:45.590 --> 02:38:45.600 align:start position:0%
within 24 hours of having patient
 
02:38:47.830 --> 02:38:47.840 align:start position:0%
contact where the the
 
02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:49.190 align:start position:0%
contact where the the
depository

02:38:49.190 --> 02:38:49.200 align:start position:0%
depository
 
02:38:51.750 --> 02:38:51.760 align:start position:0%
for all that information
 
02:38:54.469 --> 02:38:54.479 align:start position:0%
this data is extremely important to the
 
02:38:55.990 --> 02:38:56.000 align:start position:0%
continued progression of emergency
 
02:38:58.309 --> 02:38:58.319 align:start position:0%
medical services uh within the state by
 
02:39:00.790 --> 02:39:00.800 align:start position:0%
allowing our own stakeholders
 
02:39:03.750 --> 02:39:03.760 align:start position:0%
to be able to use this data to determine
 
02:39:07.270 --> 02:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
how we can progress ems in regards to
 
02:39:09.670 --> 02:39:09.680 align:start position:0%
how do we change patient care protocols
 
02:39:12.150 --> 02:39:12.160 align:start position:0%
we have two boards that specifically
 
02:39:13.830 --> 02:39:13.840 align:start position:0%
look at this information the medical
 
02:39:16.150 --> 02:39:16.160 align:start position:0%
control board which is made up of
 
02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:17.110 align:start position:0%
control board which is made up of
medical

02:39:17.110 --> 02:39:17.120 align:start position:0%
medical
 
02:39:19.830 --> 02:39:19.840 align:start position:0%
doctors emergency physicians
 
02:39:22.070 --> 02:39:22.080 align:start position:0%
they have ultimate say in regards to how
 
02:39:24.150 --> 02:39:24.160 align:start position:0%
we provide ems care in the state of new
 
02:39:26.070 --> 02:39:26.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire as well as the ems
 
02:39:29.270 --> 02:39:29.280 align:start position:0%
coordinating board who oversees the ems
 
02:39:32.469 --> 02:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
system in general
 
02:39:34.950 --> 02:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
currently the law limits our ability to
 
02:39:36.950 --> 02:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
release this information for research
 
02:39:38.389 --> 02:39:38.399 align:start position:0%
purposes only
 
02:39:40.469 --> 02:39:40.479 align:start position:0%
this bill expands the ability to share
 
02:39:42.469 --> 02:39:42.479 align:start position:0%
data not only for research purposes but
 
02:39:44.950 --> 02:39:44.960 align:start position:0%
for the analysis of the data as well
 
02:39:47.190 --> 02:39:47.200 align:start position:0%
most recently during the covet 19
 
02:39:48.950 --> 02:39:48.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic the division was working with
 
02:39:51.830 --> 02:39:51.840 align:start position:0%
contracting with a third party vendor
 
02:39:53.830 --> 02:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
that would allow real-time data
 
02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:55.429 align:start position:0%
that would allow real-time data
analytics

02:39:55.429 --> 02:39:55.439 align:start position:0%
analytics
 
02:39:57.670 --> 02:39:57.680 align:start position:0%
on covet 19 calls
 
02:39:59.750 --> 02:39:59.760 align:start position:0%
this was specifically for just the
 
02:40:01.429 --> 02:40:01.439 align:start position:0%
department of safety it wasn't being
 
02:40:03.590 --> 02:40:03.600 align:start position:0%
shared with anybody else but it gave us
 
02:40:07.830 --> 02:40:07.840 align:start position:0%
the ability to use a tool um
 
02:40:10.469 --> 02:40:10.479 align:start position:0%
that would be more readily available to
 
02:40:12.550 --> 02:40:12.560 align:start position:0%
analyze the data rather than
 
02:40:14.469 --> 02:40:14.479 align:start position:0%
pulling all the data doing our own
 
02:40:16.790 --> 02:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
statistics ourselves
 
02:40:16.800 --> 02:40:18.150 align:start position:0%
statistics ourselves
however

02:40:18.150 --> 02:40:18.160 align:start position:0%
however
 
02:40:19.510 --> 02:40:19.520 align:start position:0%
through the attorney general's office it
 
02:40:20.550 --> 02:40:20.560 align:start position:0%
was determined that we didn't have the
 
02:40:22.630 --> 02:40:22.640 align:start position:0%
ability to share it for analytical
 
02:40:24.389 --> 02:40:24.399 align:start position:0%
purposes it would have to be for a
 
02:40:26.630 --> 02:40:26.640 align:start position:0%
research related reason
 
02:40:27.750 --> 02:40:27.760 align:start position:0%
additionally there are many other
 
02:40:29.190 --> 02:40:29.200 align:start position:0%
opportunities to partner with other
 
02:40:31.349 --> 02:40:31.359 align:start position:0%
state federal agencies to enhance the
 
02:40:33.190 --> 02:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
knowledge understanding and response in
 
02:40:35.269 --> 02:40:35.279 align:start position:0%
certain areas of ems as the
 
02:40:37.830 --> 02:40:37.840 align:start position:0%
representatives said
 
02:40:39.269 --> 02:40:39.279 align:start position:0%
brought up before
 
02:40:41.269 --> 02:40:41.279 align:start position:0%
we have a partnership and we work
 
02:40:43.190 --> 02:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
closely with dhhs
 
02:40:46.230 --> 02:40:46.240 align:start position:0%
on opioid related uh information
 
02:40:48.070 --> 02:40:48.080 align:start position:0%
unfortunately at this point we have a we
 
02:40:51.429 --> 02:40:51.439 align:start position:0%
have difficulty sharing that information
 
02:40:53.510 --> 02:40:53.520 align:start position:0%
because it's not a research related uh
 
02:40:55.990 --> 02:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
it's more for surveillance in in
 
02:40:56.000 --> 02:40:58.469 align:start position:0%
it's more for surveillance in in
analytics

02:40:58.469 --> 02:40:58.479 align:start position:0%
analytics
 
02:41:00.870 --> 02:41:00.880 align:start position:0%
another example is motor vehicle crash
 
02:41:03.269 --> 02:41:03.279 align:start position:0%
data there's motor vehicle crash data in
 
02:41:04.389 --> 02:41:04.399 align:start position:0%
the state of new hampshire we would be
 
02:41:06.309 --> 02:41:06.319 align:start position:0%
able to link that specifically with ems
 
02:41:06.319 --> 02:41:07.349 align:start position:0%
able to link that specifically with ems
data

02:41:07.349 --> 02:41:07.359 align:start position:0%
data
 
02:41:09.510 --> 02:41:09.520 align:start position:0%
to really identify
 
02:41:11.269 --> 02:41:11.279 align:start position:0%
specific areas throughout the state and
 
02:41:12.870 --> 02:41:12.880 align:start position:0%
how things
 
02:41:15.269 --> 02:41:15.279 align:start position:0%
are transpiring by sharing and linking
 
02:41:17.030 --> 02:41:17.040 align:start position:0%
ems data with these other sources it
 
02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:19.279 align:start position:0%
will better equip our state and local
 
02:41:21.110 --> 02:41:21.120 align:start position:0%
first responding agency to be able to
 
02:41:21.120 --> 02:41:22.309 align:start position:0%
first responding agency to be able to
plan

02:41:22.309 --> 02:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:41:22.319 --> 02:41:23.269 align:start position:0%
plan
plan

02:41:23.269 --> 02:41:23.279 align:start position:0%
plan
 
02:41:25.750 --> 02:41:25.760 align:start position:0%
um and create interventions and evaluate
 
02:41:27.910 --> 02:41:27.920 align:start position:0%
their own performance measures
 
02:41:29.269 --> 02:41:29.279 align:start position:0%
i would like to highlight that under
 
02:41:31.910 --> 02:41:31.920 align:start position:0%
existing law as senator apprentice said
 
02:41:33.190 --> 02:41:33.200 align:start position:0%
there's a privacy committee which
 
02:41:35.349 --> 02:41:35.359 align:start position:0%
consists of seven members it includes
 
02:41:37.590 --> 02:41:37.600 align:start position:0%
the director or his designee four people
 
02:41:39.269 --> 02:41:39.279 align:start position:0%
from one of the ems
 
02:41:41.429 --> 02:41:41.439 align:start position:0%
boards that i mentioned before and two
 
02:41:42.550 --> 02:41:42.560 align:start position:0%
people not affiliated with the
 
02:41:42.560 --> 02:41:44.469 align:start position:0%
people not affiliated with the
department

02:41:44.469 --> 02:41:44.479 align:start position:0%
department
 
02:41:46.230 --> 02:41:46.240 align:start position:0%
at the end of the day that committee
 
02:41:47.910 --> 02:41:47.920 align:start position:0%
would make only a recommendation to the
 
02:41:49.190 --> 02:41:49.200 align:start position:0%
commissioner of safety and the
 
02:41:50.710 --> 02:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
commissioner safety would make the final
 
02:41:52.230 --> 02:41:52.240 align:start position:0%
determination whether that was an
 
02:41:54.389 --> 02:41:54.399 align:start position:0%
applicable request or not
 
02:41:56.550 --> 02:41:56.560 align:start position:0%
in closing i would like to thank senator
 
02:41:58.230 --> 02:41:58.240 align:start position:0%
apprentice for sponsoring this bill and
 
02:42:00.950 --> 02:42:00.960 align:start position:0%
all the other sponsors of the bill
 
02:42:03.590 --> 02:42:03.600 align:start position:0%
and just to reiterate that our ems
 
02:42:06.150 --> 02:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
system in the state of new hampshire is
 
02:42:08.389 --> 02:42:08.399 align:start position:0%
a model system especially in the
 
02:42:10.790 --> 02:42:10.800 align:start position:0%
northeast many other states actually
 
02:42:12.710 --> 02:42:12.720 align:start position:0%
going back to when senator apprentice
 
02:42:13.830 --> 02:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
was the chief
 
02:42:16.950 --> 02:42:16.960 align:start position:0%
model a lot of their ems system based
 
02:42:18.710 --> 02:42:18.720 align:start position:0%
off of the protocols and the things that
 
02:42:21.110 --> 02:42:21.120 align:start position:0%
we've done in new hampshire
 
02:42:23.510 --> 02:42:23.520 align:start position:0%
being able to use our own data for
 
02:42:25.750 --> 02:42:25.760 align:start position:0%
analytical purposes is
 
02:42:28.309 --> 02:42:28.319 align:start position:0%
vitally important for the fast response
 
02:42:30.230 --> 02:42:30.240 align:start position:0%
as we've seen in covid
 
02:42:32.870 --> 02:42:32.880 align:start position:0%
and the continued progression of our ems
 
02:42:35.030 --> 02:42:35.040 align:start position:0%
system in the state of new hampshire
 
02:42:36.630 --> 02:42:36.640 align:start position:0%
that's all i have to say if you have any
 
02:42:37.750 --> 02:42:37.760 align:start position:0%
questions i'll be more than happy to
 
02:42:44.230 --> 02:42:44.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:45.830 --> 02:42:45.840 align:start position:0%
it's a trouble when people make good
 
02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:49.030 align:start position:0%
it's a trouble when people make good
presentations

02:42:49.030 --> 02:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:51.830 --> 02:42:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:42:54.190 --> 02:42:54.200 align:start position:0%

02:42:58.070 --> 02:42:58.080 align:start position:0%

your motion representative kelsey
 
03:35:41.349 --> 03:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
um i just
 
03:35:43.269 --> 03:35:43.279 align:start position:0%
this i think this bill is very important
 
03:35:45.349 --> 03:35:45.359 align:start position:0%
i think this bill just moves us into a
 
03:35:47.030 --> 03:35:47.040 align:start position:0%
position to allow
 
03:35:50.150 --> 03:35:50.160 align:start position:0%
um to allow this to happen and i
 
03:35:52.469 --> 03:35:52.479 align:start position:0%
i just think that you know following up
 
03:35:54.389 --> 03:35:54.399 align:start position:0%
on what representative mcmahon said
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%

03:36:08.229 --> 03:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:12.389 --> 03:36:12.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:14.630 --> 03:36:14.640 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure if this is working
 
03:36:16.870 --> 03:36:16.880 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i think that it's
 
03:36:18.150 --> 03:36:18.160 align:start position:0%

that it's already possible but i
 
03:36:21.910 --> 03:36:21.920 align:start position:0%
appreciate the the change in motion
 
03:36:23.269 --> 03:36:23.279 align:start position:0%

03:36:28.550 --> 03:36:28.560 align:start position:0%

03:38:29.590 --> 03:38:29.600 align:start position:0%
house bill 416 this is one that i think
 
03:38:31.990 --> 03:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
i muffed it was supposed to be
 
03:38:34.630 --> 03:38:34.640 align:start position:0%
exact last week and
 
03:38:39.030 --> 03:38:39.040 align:start position:0%
got pushed to the corner and got buried
 
03:38:41.910 --> 03:38:41.920 align:start position:0%
and because of that and it is
 
03:38:44.630 --> 03:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
an early bill it has to be looked at
 
03:38:47.990 --> 03:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
by the house on thursday
 
03:38:50.389 --> 03:38:50.399 align:start position:0%
if you've read the calendar you will see
 
03:38:53.110 --> 03:38:53.120 align:start position:0%
it just simply lists it by title and
 
03:38:54.950 --> 03:38:54.960 align:start position:0%
says go to the floor with no
 
03:38:54.960 --> 03:38:57.030 align:start position:0%
says go to the floor with no
recommendation

03:38:57.030 --> 03:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation
 
03:38:58.870 --> 03:38:58.880 align:start position:0%
but what we can do and i just spoke with
 
03:39:01.110 --> 03:39:01.120 align:start position:0%
the clerk again over the lunch hour is
 
03:39:03.030 --> 03:39:03.040 align:start position:0%
we can discuss it
 
03:39:05.830 --> 03:39:05.840 align:start position:0%
no voting but we can discuss it
 
03:39:05.840 --> 03:39:07.429 align:start position:0%
no voting but we can discuss it
and

03:39:07.429 --> 03:39:07.439 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:39:09.910 --> 03:39:09.920 align:start position:0%
perhaps i hope
 
03:39:14.389 --> 03:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
coalesce around one viewpoint or if not
 
03:39:17.269 --> 03:39:17.279 align:start position:0%
two different viewpoints and in any of
 
03:39:20.070 --> 03:39:20.080 align:start position:0%
those cases there can be floor speeches
 
03:39:22.790 --> 03:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
and floor amendments so we can get our
 
03:39:24.870 --> 03:39:24.880 align:start position:0%
licks in on this
 
03:39:27.030 --> 03:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
representative weber
 
03:39:27.040 --> 03:39:28.550 align:start position:0%
representative weber
has

03:39:28.550 --> 03:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
has
 
03:39:32.469 --> 03:39:32.479 align:start position:0%
crafted an amendment 1438
 
03:39:44.070 --> 03:39:44.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:39:46.710 --> 03:39:46.720 align:start position:0%
okay better check the stack to make sure
 
03:39:48.070 --> 03:39:48.080 align:start position:0%
i think
 
03:39:51.030 --> 03:39:51.040 align:start position:0%
we're good here here's some more
 
03:39:53.590 --> 03:39:53.600 align:start position:0%
and make sure that it's all this
 
03:39:55.510 --> 03:39:55.520 align:start position:0%
representative merchant while you're up
 
03:39:58.150 --> 03:39:58.160 align:start position:0%
i got three for you right here okay yeah
 
03:39:59.830 --> 03:39:59.840 align:start position:0%
they're under here
 
03:40:01.670 --> 03:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
okay i think we still need two more in
 
03:40:05.670 --> 03:40:05.680 align:start position:0%
the middle here two more in the middle
 
03:40:22.550 --> 03:40:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:27.510 --> 03:40:27.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:29.189 --> 03:40:29.199 align:start position:0%
you have extras
 
03:40:33.750 --> 03:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:35.429 --> 03:40:35.439 align:start position:0%
so once you get it take a look at it
 
03:40:37.750 --> 03:40:37.760 align:start position:0%
this is um representative weber's
 
03:40:37.760 --> 03:40:41.349 align:start position:0%
this is um representative weber's
amendment

03:40:41.349 --> 03:40:41.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:40:43.189 --> 03:40:43.199 align:start position:0%
and since representative curry is
 
03:40:44.870 --> 03:40:44.880 align:start position:0%
replacing her you can explain it in
 
03:40:48.150 --> 03:40:48.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:01.510 --> 03:41:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:01.520 --> 03:41:14.550 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:41:14.550 --> 03:41:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:14.560 --> 03:41:50.630 align:start position:0%

03:41:50.640 --> 03:42:45.189 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:42:45.189 --> 03:42:45.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:45.199 --> 03:42:52.630 align:start position:0%

03:43:20.150 --> 03:43:20.160 align:start position:0%
needed to be changed
 
03:43:24.630 --> 03:43:24.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:28.389 --> 03:43:28.399 align:start position:0%

03:43:40.870 --> 03:43:40.880 align:start position:0%
the current reading is uh starting in
 
03:43:42.070 --> 03:43:42.080 align:start position:0%
the previous sentence that there would
 
03:43:43.510 --> 03:43:43.520 align:start position:0%
be a behavioral assessment and a
 
03:43:45.510 --> 03:43:45.520 align:start position:0%
behavioral intervention plan
 
03:43:47.269 --> 03:43:47.279 align:start position:0%
what was added was
 
03:43:49.590 --> 03:43:49.600 align:start position:0%
if clinically indicated
 
03:43:51.030 --> 03:43:51.040 align:start position:0%
in other words not saying that every
 
03:43:53.030 --> 03:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
single kid has to have this
 
03:43:54.150 --> 03:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
but that
 
03:43:56.150 --> 03:43:56.160 align:start position:0%
if it's clinically indicated then it
 
03:43:57.750 --> 03:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
would occur
 
03:43:59.510 --> 03:43:59.520 align:start position:0%
then if you work your way down again on
 
03:44:01.670 --> 03:44:01.680 align:start position:0%
the bill not the amendment page two
 
03:44:04.469 --> 03:44:04.479 align:start position:0%
lines six and seven and it gave the
 
03:44:06.389 --> 03:44:06.399 align:start position:0%
information about who would be doing it
 
03:44:07.830 --> 03:44:07.840 align:start position:0%
the functional behavioral assessment
 
03:44:09.830 --> 03:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
conducted by a qualified individual and
 
03:44:11.030 --> 03:44:11.040 align:start position:0%
so on
 
03:44:12.630 --> 03:44:12.640 align:start position:0%
and now that
 
03:44:16.309 --> 03:44:16.319 align:start position:0%
uh goes on to say
 
03:44:17.910 --> 03:44:17.920 align:start position:0%
instead of a qualified individual at a
 
03:44:20.229 --> 03:44:20.239 align:start position:0%
fair reimbursement rate and is which may
 
03:44:21.750 --> 03:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
include a board certified analyst that's
 
03:44:25.750 --> 03:44:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:28.070 --> 03:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
individuals qualified to perform the
 
03:44:30.710 --> 03:44:30.720 align:start position:0%
assessment which may include but is not
 
03:44:32.469 --> 03:44:32.479 align:start position:0%
limited to
 
03:44:33.910 --> 03:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
a board-certified analyst or
 
03:44:36.309 --> 03:44:36.319 align:start position:0%
psychologist so it basically broadens
 
03:44:36.319 --> 03:44:37.990 align:start position:0%
psychologist so it basically broadens
slightly

03:44:37.990 --> 03:44:38.000 align:start position:0%
slightly
 
03:44:40.150 --> 03:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
um it doesn't set the reimbursement rate
 
03:44:42.389 --> 03:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
issue which is a good thing
 
03:44:44.630 --> 03:44:44.640 align:start position:0%
and it uh
 
03:44:46.150 --> 03:44:46.160 align:start position:0%
kind of
 
03:44:47.990 --> 03:44:48.000 align:start position:0%
broadens a little bit who can do it it
 
03:44:49.750 --> 03:44:49.760 align:start position:0%
was not really
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
it is you say which may include this
 
03:44:53.830 --> 03:44:53.840 align:start position:0%
kind of broadens it which may include
 
03:44:55.189 --> 03:44:55.199 align:start position:0%
certified behavior analyst or
 
03:44:57.990 --> 03:44:58.000 align:start position:0%
psychologist not just behavior analysts
 
03:45:00.150 --> 03:45:00.160 align:start position:0%
so that's pretty minor changes but those
 
03:45:01.670 --> 03:45:01.680 align:start position:0%
were things that came up during the
 
03:45:01.680 --> 03:45:02.790 align:start position:0%
were things that came up during the
hearing

03:45:02.790 --> 03:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
hearing
 
03:45:04.790 --> 03:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
senator whitley had
 
03:45:06.710 --> 03:45:06.720 align:start position:0%
agreed i remember we quickly came up
 
03:45:08.070 --> 03:45:08.080 align:start position:0%
with some wording she had come up with
 
03:45:09.510 --> 03:45:09.520 align:start position:0%
some wording handed us to the seahander
 
03:45:11.590 --> 03:45:11.600 align:start position:0%
to christina and we tried to get the
 
03:45:13.189 --> 03:45:13.199 align:start position:0%
amendment as quickly as possible but
 
03:45:15.189 --> 03:45:15.199 align:start position:0%
here we are today
 
03:45:17.670 --> 03:45:17.680 align:start position:0%
the effective date is also changed 60
 
03:45:20.229 --> 03:45:20.239 align:start position:0%
days after passage two takes effect
 
03:45:22.469 --> 03:45:22.479 align:start position:0%
january one twenty twenty four yes i'm
 
03:45:23.910 --> 03:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
sorry i had that written in red and i
 
03:45:26.550 --> 03:45:26.560 align:start position:0%
still didn't say it
 
03:45:28.309 --> 03:45:28.319 align:start position:0%
yes just to push it out and the reason
 
03:45:30.070 --> 03:45:30.080 align:start position:0%
for that is because of the workforce
 
03:45:33.030 --> 03:45:33.040 align:start position:0%
issues remember this bill also does
 
03:45:35.510 --> 03:45:35.520 align:start position:0%
put some money into the idea of uh
 
03:45:38.150 --> 03:45:38.160 align:start position:0%
sorry no i'm mixing up bills um several
 
03:45:40.150 --> 03:45:40.160 align:start position:0%
but be considering our workforce issues
 
03:45:41.910 --> 03:45:41.920 align:start position:0%
and getting this into
 
03:45:44.070 --> 03:45:44.080 align:start position:0%
place we wanted to give more time before
 
03:45:44.950 --> 03:45:44.960 align:start position:0%
they were
 
03:45:46.790 --> 03:45:46.800 align:start position:0%
directed to have to get this underway
 
03:45:48.150 --> 03:45:48.160 align:start position:0%
because they might not be able to do
 
03:45:50.790 --> 03:45:50.800 align:start position:0%
with current uh current workforce
 
03:45:50.800 --> 03:45:54.630 align:start position:0%
with current uh current workforce
capability

03:45:54.630 --> 03:45:54.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:45:56.469 --> 03:45:56.479 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
03:45:59.429 --> 03:45:59.439 align:start position:0%
um just a question i had on my notes and
 
03:46:01.750 --> 03:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
i didn't see that i had an answer to my
 
03:46:04.790 --> 03:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
question and i may have discussed it so
 
03:46:06.830 --> 03:46:06.840 align:start position:0%
if the patient happens to be out of
 
03:46:06.840 --> 03:46:08.630 align:start position:0%
if the patient happens to be out of
state

03:46:08.630 --> 03:46:08.640 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:46:10.070 --> 03:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
can they do the testing before they
 
03:46:11.750 --> 03:46:11.760 align:start position:0%
bring them back or to the requirement
 
03:46:13.510 --> 03:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
that the testing be done before they
 
03:46:15.590 --> 03:46:15.600 align:start position:0%
return to the state
 
03:46:17.110 --> 03:46:17.120 align:start position:0%
and i assume that that question was
 
03:46:19.590 --> 03:46:19.600 align:start position:0%
raised and i don't recall the answer
 
03:46:21.349 --> 03:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
representative knurk
 
03:46:23.349 --> 03:46:23.359 align:start position:0%
well remember that in the lines just a
 
03:46:25.510 --> 03:46:25.520 align:start position:0%
little bit above that you can actually
 
03:46:29.590 --> 03:46:29.600 align:start position:0%
just look on the amendment on lines um
 
03:46:30.710 --> 03:46:30.720 align:start position:0%
12 and
 
03:46:33.030 --> 03:46:33.040 align:start position:0%
12 through 14 that if it cannot be
 
03:46:34.469 --> 03:46:34.479 align:start position:0%
completed prior to entry into
 
03:46:35.910 --> 03:46:35.920 align:start position:0%
residential treatment the department
 
03:46:37.429 --> 03:46:37.439 align:start position:0%
shall ensure that ensure that an
 
03:46:39.670 --> 03:46:39.680 align:start position:0%
assessment is initiated not completed
 
03:46:42.550 --> 03:46:42.560 align:start position:0%
but initiated within 30 days because i
 
03:46:44.550 --> 03:46:44.560 align:start position:0%
think that handles that problem because
 
03:46:45.750 --> 03:46:45.760 align:start position:0%
always we have to find people we
 
03:46:47.590 --> 03:46:47.600 align:start position:0%
contract with out of state which may be
 
03:46:50.070 --> 03:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
very cumbersome and difficult and this
 
03:46:52.630 --> 03:46:52.640 align:start position:0%
allows us to get the kid in
 
03:46:54.550 --> 03:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
and do the assessment so they're placed
 
03:46:55.750 --> 03:46:55.760 align:start position:0%
in the right facility and they have the
 
03:46:57.349 --> 03:46:57.359 align:start position:0%
right treatment plan
 
03:46:59.750 --> 03:46:59.760 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
03:47:02.790 --> 03:47:02.800 align:start position:0%
yes i think the the intent is not about
 
03:47:04.870 --> 03:47:04.880 align:start position:0%
doing this before we bring people back
 
03:47:06.389 --> 03:47:06.399 align:start position:0%
or bringing them back to their families
 
03:47:09.590 --> 03:47:09.600 align:start position:0%
but the intent is to
 
03:47:12.070 --> 03:47:12.080 align:start position:0%
do this as early as possible so that
 
03:47:12.080 --> 03:47:12.950 align:start position:0%
do this as early as possible so that
less

03:47:12.950 --> 03:47:12.960 align:start position:0%
less
 
03:47:14.790 --> 03:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
children will have to actually be placed
 
03:47:17.030 --> 03:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
in residential settings and certainly an
 
03:47:19.429 --> 03:47:19.439 align:start position:0%
out-of-state residential savings i also
 
03:47:20.950 --> 03:47:20.960 align:start position:0%
just want to say
 
03:47:20.960 --> 03:47:22.229 align:start position:0%
just want to say
that

03:47:22.229 --> 03:47:22.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:47:24.550 --> 03:47:24.560 align:start position:0%
i think it's good that the amendment
 
03:47:27.510 --> 03:47:27.520 align:start position:0%
um broadens who can do this um to tell
 
03:47:29.429 --> 03:47:29.439 align:start position:0%
you the truth i think
 
03:47:30.830 --> 03:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what a
 
03:47:33.349 --> 03:47:33.359 align:start position:0%
board-certified behavior analyst is
 
03:47:34.710 --> 03:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
because i don't know what board they're
 
03:47:36.870 --> 03:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
03:47:40.150 --> 03:47:40.160 align:start position:0%
i think most people who do this kind of
 
03:47:40.160 --> 03:47:41.830 align:start position:0%
i think most people who do this kind of
report

03:47:41.830 --> 03:47:41.840 align:start position:0%
report
 
03:47:44.150 --> 03:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
are school psychologists not exclusively
 
03:47:44.160 --> 03:47:45.030 align:start position:0%
are school psychologists not exclusively
but

03:47:45.030 --> 03:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:47:48.790 --> 03:47:48.800 align:start position:0%

03:47:59.429 --> 03:47:59.439 align:start position:0%
i'm wondering on line six of the bill or
 
03:48:02.389 --> 03:48:02.399 align:start position:0%
page two sorry line six where it says by
 
03:48:05.189 --> 03:48:05.199 align:start position:0%
a qualified individual at a fair
 
03:48:06.790 --> 03:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate
 
03:48:06.800 --> 03:48:08.790 align:start position:0%
reimbursement rate
is

03:48:08.790 --> 03:48:08.800 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:48:11.910 --> 03:48:11.920 align:start position:0%
excluded from the amendment and i didn't
 
03:48:13.670 --> 03:48:13.680 align:start position:0%
know whether or not that was even
 
03:48:13.680 --> 03:48:14.790 align:start position:0%
know whether or not that was even
important

03:48:14.790 --> 03:48:14.800 align:start position:0%
important
 
03:48:17.510 --> 03:48:17.520 align:start position:0%
or why that had been originally put into
 
03:48:22.309 --> 03:48:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:22.319 --> 03:48:23.110 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:48:23.110 --> 03:48:23.120 align:start position:0%
well
 
03:48:25.750 --> 03:48:25.760 align:start position:0%
line 14 of the amendment talks about
 
03:48:28.150 --> 03:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
individuals qualified so i i think
 
03:48:30.550 --> 03:48:30.560 align:start position:0%
that's qualified individuals
 
03:48:32.389 --> 03:48:32.399 align:start position:0%
right but the reimbursement rights i see
 
03:48:32.399 --> 03:48:33.110 align:start position:0%
right but the reimbursement rights i see
yeah

03:48:33.110 --> 03:48:33.120 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
03:48:35.510 --> 03:48:35.520 align:start position:0%
may i answer that yes you may i think in
 
03:48:37.590 --> 03:48:37.600 align:start position:0%
general we try not to get involved in
 
03:48:39.429 --> 03:48:39.439 align:start position:0%
setting reimbursement rates or mandating
 
03:48:41.910 --> 03:48:41.920 align:start position:0%
what reimbursement rates should be
 
03:48:44.150 --> 03:48:44.160 align:start position:0%
because that's usually not our position
 
03:48:45.510 --> 03:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
particularly in the policy committee
 
03:48:47.269 --> 03:48:47.279 align:start position:0%
even in commerce we generally try not to
 
03:48:53.030 --> 03:48:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:48:54.030 --> 03:48:54.040 align:start position:0%

representative gay
 
03:48:59.910 --> 03:48:59.920 align:start position:0%
i very much support this bill
 
03:49:03.030 --> 03:49:03.040 align:start position:0%
i was horrified to find out that uh we
 
03:49:05.429 --> 03:49:05.439 align:start position:0%
needed to correct this serious omission
 
03:49:07.590 --> 03:49:07.600 align:start position:0%
about sending kids away without ever
 
03:49:09.510 --> 03:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
even having assessed
 
03:49:11.910 --> 03:49:11.920 align:start position:0%
done a thorough assessment that's just a
 
03:49:14.950 --> 03:49:14.960 align:start position:0%
horror story and one of my constituents
 
03:49:18.550 --> 03:49:18.560 align:start position:0%
is trying to visit her son who is
 
03:49:22.710 --> 03:49:22.720 align:start position:0%
now 30 but has behavioral but
 
03:49:24.710 --> 03:49:24.720 align:start position:0%
i don't know because i've never met him
 
03:49:25.990 --> 03:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
and of course i'm listening to his
 
03:49:28.790 --> 03:49:28.800 align:start position:0%
mother uh but i mean the place where he
 
03:49:31.269 --> 03:49:31.279 align:start position:0%
is is far from her home
 
03:49:32.950 --> 03:49:32.960 align:start position:0%
and when she goes they'll only let her
 
03:49:34.870 --> 03:49:34.880 align:start position:0%
visit after she spends two and a half
 
03:49:36.630 --> 03:49:36.640 align:start position:0%
hours to get there they'll only let her
 
03:49:39.910 --> 03:49:39.920 align:start position:0%
visit for an hour so and and as i
 
03:49:41.670 --> 03:49:41.680 align:start position:0%
understand in that in the state of
 
03:49:43.510 --> 03:49:43.520 align:start position:0%
massachusetts there have been real
 
03:49:46.630 --> 03:49:46.640 align:start position:0%
efforts to try to improve that
 
03:49:46.640 --> 03:49:47.510 align:start position:0%
efforts to try to improve that
school

03:49:47.510 --> 03:49:47.520 align:start position:0%
school
 
03:49:47.520 --> 03:49:48.389 align:start position:0%
school
so

03:49:48.389 --> 03:49:48.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:49:49.510 --> 03:49:49.520 align:start position:0%
i'm hoping
 
03:49:52.469 --> 03:49:52.479 align:start position:0%
my hope is that if we pass this and now
 
03:49:54.710 --> 03:49:54.720 align:start position:0%
they have to do assessments on all kids
 
03:49:57.910 --> 03:49:57.920 align:start position:0%
considered maybe we'll build one here in
 
03:50:00.070 --> 03:50:00.080 align:start position:0%
new hampshire where we have more control
 
03:50:02.150 --> 03:50:02.160 align:start position:0%
over how the people are treated and how
 
03:50:05.510 --> 03:50:05.520 align:start position:0%
accessible they are to their families
 
03:50:07.910 --> 03:50:07.920 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro yeah i just want
 
03:50:10.630 --> 03:50:10.640 align:start position:0%
to say that like
 
03:50:12.630 --> 03:50:12.640 align:start position:0%
people are complicated and families are
 
03:50:14.389 --> 03:50:14.399 align:start position:0%
complicated and the system is
 
03:50:17.590 --> 03:50:17.600 align:start position:0%
complicated um to take care of children
 
03:50:19.030 --> 03:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
and it's
 
03:50:21.910 --> 03:50:21.920 align:start position:0%
imperfect at best and sometimes bad
 
03:50:23.670 --> 03:50:23.680 align:start position:0%
things happen sometimes
 
03:50:25.429 --> 03:50:25.439 align:start position:0%
we have great results
 
03:50:27.830 --> 03:50:27.840 align:start position:0%
with kids getting services and coming
 
03:50:30.070 --> 03:50:30.080 align:start position:0%
back to their families and doing well
 
03:50:30.080 --> 03:50:30.870 align:start position:0%
back to their families and doing well
and

03:50:30.870 --> 03:50:30.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:50:32.630 --> 03:50:32.640 align:start position:0%
i don't think we should think of this as
 
03:50:34.790 --> 03:50:34.800 align:start position:0%
a solution to the whole
 
03:50:37.590 --> 03:50:37.600 align:start position:0%
big problem i think this is just this
 
03:50:40.469 --> 03:50:40.479 align:start position:0%
behavioral analysis and behavioral plan
 
03:50:42.790 --> 03:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
is one tool and i think it's a good
 
03:50:44.630 --> 03:50:44.640 align:start position:0%
thing that it be mandated that it be
 
03:50:46.550 --> 03:50:46.560 align:start position:0%
used um
 
03:50:48.389 --> 03:50:48.399 align:start position:0%
but i don't think we should think that
 
03:50:50.710 --> 03:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
this in itself is going to be a solution
 
03:50:50.720 --> 03:50:51.510 align:start position:0%
this in itself is going to be a solution
to

03:50:51.510 --> 03:50:51.520 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:50:55.910 --> 03:50:55.920 align:start position:0%
larger systemic problems um
 
03:50:57.910 --> 03:50:57.920 align:start position:0%
it's a good thing to do it's a small
 
03:51:05.670 --> 03:51:05.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:08.070 --> 03:51:08.080 align:start position:0%
let me just ask this if we were to vote
 
03:51:10.790 --> 03:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
which we aren't
 
03:51:15.510 --> 03:51:15.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:15.520 --> 03:51:16.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

03:51:16.870 --> 03:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
okay
 
03:51:19.110 --> 03:51:19.120 align:start position:0%
if we were to vote and we aren't
 
03:51:23.189 --> 03:51:23.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:26.150 --> 03:51:26.160 align:start position:0%
yay we come together again
 
03:51:28.830 --> 03:51:28.840 align:start position:0%
and if we were would you say
 
03:51:30.790 --> 03:51:30.800 align:start position:0%
consent i don't know we can get away
 
03:51:34.070 --> 03:51:34.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:36.710 --> 03:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
well what we do is first of all
 
03:51:38.950 --> 03:51:38.960 align:start position:0%
pass this along to finance division
 
03:51:38.960 --> 03:51:40.309 align:start position:0%
pass this along to finance division
three

03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
three
 
03:51:42.630 --> 03:51:42.640 align:start position:0%
because they got to look at it next and
 
03:51:45.429 --> 03:51:45.439 align:start position:0%
say this is our discussion our sense of
 
03:51:46.550 --> 03:51:46.560 align:start position:0%
the meeting
 
03:51:49.429 --> 03:51:49.439 align:start position:0%
and a straw poll
 
03:51:49.439 --> 03:51:50.389 align:start position:0%
and a straw poll
then

03:51:50.389 --> 03:51:50.399 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:51:52.790 --> 03:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
uh when this is actually coming up on
 
03:51:54.309 --> 03:51:54.319 align:start position:0%
thursday isn't it
 
03:51:57.830 --> 03:51:57.840 align:start position:0%
so maybe skip finance um or whatever but
 
03:51:59.269 --> 03:51:59.279 align:start position:0%
um what
 
03:52:01.990 --> 03:52:02.000 align:start position:0%
representative weber and the clerk and i
 
03:52:03.990 --> 03:52:04.000 align:start position:0%
have kind of figured out
 
03:52:04.000 --> 03:52:04.870 align:start position:0%
have kind of figured out
is

03:52:04.870 --> 03:52:04.880 align:start position:0%
is
 
03:52:07.750 --> 03:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
we would ask one or two people
 
03:52:07.760 --> 03:52:08.550 align:start position:0%
we would ask one or two people
to

03:52:08.550 --> 03:52:08.560 align:start position:0%
to
 
03:52:10.389 --> 03:52:10.399 align:start position:0%
um speak to
 
03:52:13.429 --> 03:52:13.439 align:start position:0%
this bill and it would be sure as heck
 
03:52:15.349 --> 03:52:15.359 align:start position:0%
nice to have a democrat and republican
 
03:52:16.950 --> 03:52:16.960 align:start position:0%
do it to say
 
03:52:19.510 --> 03:52:19.520 align:start position:0%
that in our committee we had pretty much
 
03:52:21.990 --> 03:52:22.000 align:start position:0%
consensus can't speak for everybody but
 
03:52:24.469 --> 03:52:24.479 align:start position:0%
pretty much consensus saw a lot of hands
 
03:52:28.710 --> 03:52:28.720 align:start position:0%
19 at least and uh we go from there
 
03:52:30.309 --> 03:52:30.319 align:start position:0%
representative canark we will have to
 
03:52:31.750 --> 03:52:31.760 align:start position:0%
introduce and move the four amendment
 
03:52:33.590 --> 03:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
first we will obviously uh and will we
 
03:52:35.990 --> 03:52:36.000 align:start position:0%
will we speak to the amendment itself or
 
03:52:37.910 --> 03:52:37.920 align:start position:0%
will we first get the amendment through
 
03:52:39.510 --> 03:52:39.520 align:start position:0%
and then speak to the bill because of
 
03:52:41.349 --> 03:52:41.359 align:start position:0%
course we shouldn't be
 
03:52:42.630 --> 03:52:42.640 align:start position:0%
you know speaking to the bill when we
 
03:52:43.670 --> 03:52:43.680 align:start position:0%
actually have the amendment as the
 
03:52:45.110 --> 03:52:45.120 align:start position:0%
motion on the floor
 
03:52:47.189 --> 03:52:47.199 align:start position:0%
uh representative weber told me she
 
03:52:50.229 --> 03:52:50.239 align:start position:0%
would be trying to get uh the amendment
 
03:52:51.590 --> 03:52:51.600 align:start position:0%
into the seat
 
03:52:53.110 --> 03:52:53.120 align:start position:0%
backs right but we still have to
 
03:52:54.630 --> 03:52:54.640 align:start position:0%
introduce it it has to be and it still
 
03:52:57.429 --> 03:52:57.439 align:start position:0%
has to be introduced
 
03:52:59.670 --> 03:52:59.680 align:start position:0%
and voted out and voted on and she plans
 
03:53:01.510 --> 03:53:01.520 align:start position:0%
to be there right
 
03:53:05.030 --> 03:53:05.040 align:start position:0%
so it sounds like we're saying
 
03:53:07.030 --> 03:53:07.040 align:start position:0%
uh let's get it back and actually
 
03:53:08.229 --> 03:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
another thing is do you want really two
 
03:53:09.830 --> 03:53:09.840 align:start position:0%
to speak or one to speak and the other
 
03:53:11.910 --> 03:53:11.920 align:start position:0%
side to do the pi
 
03:53:13.990 --> 03:53:14.000 align:start position:0%
do you put well all right one second
 
03:53:15.590 --> 03:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
here just to make it faster for the
 
03:53:16.870 --> 03:53:16.880 align:start position:0%
house i was thinking if we all sort of
 
03:53:19.030 --> 03:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
agree and we don't have a vote obviously
 
03:53:19.910 --> 03:53:19.920 align:start position:0%
but we
 
03:53:22.870 --> 03:53:22.880 align:start position:0%
have each side present consistently
 
03:53:26.389 --> 03:53:26.399 align:start position:0%
maybe that might be good signaling
 
03:53:27.990 --> 03:53:28.000 align:start position:0%
well i don't care if it takes a while i
 
03:53:29.670 --> 03:53:29.680 align:start position:0%
didn't make a promise okay that the
 
03:53:31.070 --> 03:53:31.080 align:start position:0%
house would have joined
 
03:53:34.950 --> 03:53:34.960 align:start position:0%
324. um who on the republican side who
 
03:53:34.960 --> 03:53:35.750 align:start position:0%
324. um who on the republican side who
would

03:53:35.750 --> 03:53:35.760 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:53:36.950 --> 03:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
you go ahead
 
03:53:39.269 --> 03:53:39.279 align:start position:0%
uh thank you mr chairman i i think that
 
03:53:41.189 --> 03:53:41.199 align:start position:0%
if two people were to speak very quickly
 
03:53:42.710 --> 03:53:42.720 align:start position:0%
on it we could hopefully just do a voice
 
03:53:45.110 --> 03:53:45.120 align:start position:0%
vote since there's consensus on it
 
03:53:47.429 --> 03:53:47.439 align:start position:0%
otherwise i understand the pi issue but
 
03:53:48.790 --> 03:53:48.800 align:start position:0%
that's true
 
03:53:50.150 --> 03:53:50.160 align:start position:0%
might not get to a pi that's a good
 
03:53:52.550 --> 03:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
point but let's try to convince you know
 
03:53:54.630 --> 03:53:54.640 align:start position:0%
limit ourselves to like two minutes
 
03:53:57.349 --> 03:53:57.359 align:start position:0%
is there anybody who is thinking of
 
03:54:02.710 --> 03:54:02.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:05.830 --> 03:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
okay so uh we would like two people to
 
03:54:07.830 --> 03:54:07.840 align:start position:0%
hop up and briefly
 
03:54:10.950 --> 03:54:10.960 align:start position:0%
speak to the but
 
03:54:12.790 --> 03:54:12.800 align:start position:0%
one question
 
03:54:15.110 --> 03:54:15.120 align:start position:0%
during this discussion we talked about
 
03:54:16.710 --> 03:54:16.720 align:start position:0%
using this functional behavioral
 
03:54:18.790 --> 03:54:18.800 align:start position:0%
assessment is a tool to measure when
 
03:54:20.710 --> 03:54:20.720 align:start position:0%
somebody's ready to come home
 
03:54:23.030 --> 03:54:23.040 align:start position:0%
my impression was when it started that
 
03:54:25.830 --> 03:54:25.840 align:start position:0%
the main purpose here is to get a plan
 
03:54:27.189 --> 03:54:27.199 align:start position:0%
before they go
 
03:54:29.429 --> 03:54:29.439 align:start position:0%
so we're given some instructions to the
 
03:54:31.670 --> 03:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
placement about what we expect them to
 
03:54:31.680 --> 03:54:32.790 align:start position:0%
placement about what we expect them to
accomplish

03:54:32.790 --> 03:54:32.800 align:start position:0%
accomplish
 
03:54:34.550 --> 03:54:34.560 align:start position:0%
and i want to make sure that that
 
03:54:36.150 --> 03:54:36.160 align:start position:0%
doesn't just
 
03:54:38.309 --> 03:54:38.319 align:start position:0%
if we if we say this is the way you
 
03:54:39.910 --> 03:54:39.920 align:start position:0%
decide when they're ready to come home
 
03:54:41.750 --> 03:54:41.760 align:start position:0%
that's really not good enough i think
 
03:54:43.510 --> 03:54:43.520 align:start position:0%
what we really need to do is focus on
 
03:54:45.590 --> 03:54:45.600 align:start position:0%
that first step making sure we have a
 
03:54:47.510 --> 03:54:47.520 align:start position:0%
plan when they go
 
03:54:49.429 --> 03:54:49.439 align:start position:0%
is does anybody
 
03:54:51.349 --> 03:54:51.359 align:start position:0%
have a problem with that and also to
 
03:54:52.950 --> 03:54:52.960 align:start position:0%
make sure they're getting to the right
 
03:54:54.710 --> 03:54:54.720 align:start position:0%
setting for care i mean if you can get
 
03:54:56.309 --> 03:54:56.319 align:start position:0%
them if you can keep them out of a
 
03:54:58.309 --> 03:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
residential care facility as betty was
 
03:54:58.319 --> 03:54:59.429 align:start position:0%
residential care facility as betty was
saying

03:54:59.429 --> 03:54:59.439 align:start position:0%
saying
 
03:55:01.910 --> 03:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
sorry representative gay um
 
03:55:03.510 --> 03:55:03.520 align:start position:0%
and into the proper
 
03:55:05.349 --> 03:55:05.359 align:start position:0%
lesser level it'll save money it'll be
 
03:55:06.550 --> 03:55:06.560 align:start position:0%
better for the kid it's better for the
 
03:55:09.110 --> 03:55:09.120 align:start position:0%
family so we want to try to
 
03:55:10.870 --> 03:55:10.880 align:start position:0%
get the appropriate it's like anything
 
03:55:12.150 --> 03:55:12.160 align:start position:0%
else it's like anything in medicine you
 
03:55:13.910 --> 03:55:13.920 align:start position:0%
want to have an idea what your diagnosis
 
03:55:15.670 --> 03:55:15.680 align:start position:0%
is before you develop a treatment plan
 
03:55:17.189 --> 03:55:17.199 align:start position:0%
well i asked my wife about that and she
 
03:55:18.950 --> 03:55:18.960 align:start position:0%
said she does that all the time yeah
 
03:55:21.269 --> 03:55:21.279 align:start position:0%
yeah we kind of mentioned that because
 
03:55:23.910 --> 03:55:23.920 align:start position:0%
it's not a one-size-fits-all
 
03:55:27.349 --> 03:55:27.359 align:start position:0%
so who i'm looking for a couple people
 
03:55:29.830 --> 03:55:29.840 align:start position:0%
who might like to speak
 
03:55:31.670 --> 03:55:31.680 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro what do you know
 
03:55:34.550 --> 03:55:34.560 align:start position:0%
about mental health issues huh
 
03:55:36.550 --> 03:55:36.560 align:start position:0%
studied it a little bit i'll make it
 
03:55:36.560 --> 03:55:38.550 align:start position:0%
studied it a little bit i'll make it
brief

03:55:38.550 --> 03:55:38.560 align:start position:0%
brief
 
03:55:41.269 --> 03:55:41.279 align:start position:0%
and somebody from
 
03:55:41.279 --> 03:55:45.349 align:start position:0%
and somebody from
decide

03:55:45.349 --> 03:55:45.359 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:45.359 --> 03:55:47.750 align:start position:0%
 
well

03:55:47.750 --> 03:55:47.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:47.760 --> 03:55:49.670 align:start position:0%
 
ready

03:55:49.670 --> 03:55:49.680 align:start position:0%
ready
 
03:55:54.870 --> 03:55:54.880 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:03.590 --> 03:56:03.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:06.469 --> 03:56:06.479 align:start position:0%
okay so representative gay if you and
 
03:56:08.389 --> 03:56:08.399 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
03:56:12.229 --> 03:56:12.239 align:start position:0%
could get into the cahoots on um
 
03:56:15.429 --> 03:56:15.439 align:start position:0%
your speeches so you dovetail nicely i
 
03:56:16.790 --> 03:56:16.800 align:start position:0%
think that
 
03:56:19.670 --> 03:56:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh do we need a pi lined up ready to go
 
03:56:21.269 --> 03:56:21.279 align:start position:0%
i think we're gonna try to go for voice
 
03:56:21.279 --> 03:56:27.429 align:start position:0%
i think we're gonna try to go for voice
vote

03:56:27.429 --> 03:56:27.439 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:30.630 --> 03:56:30.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:32.229 --> 03:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
to be blunt we're gonna have a harder
 
03:56:34.070 --> 03:56:34.080 align:start position:0%
time convincing some republicans if you
 
03:56:35.830 --> 03:56:35.840 align:start position:0%
do the pi it's gonna carry more weight
 
03:56:37.429 --> 03:56:37.439 align:start position:0%
than in three that if i get up and do it
 
03:56:40.469 --> 03:56:40.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:42.630 --> 03:56:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay erica
 
03:56:42.640 --> 03:56:45.110 align:start position:0%
okay erica
leon

03:56:45.110 --> 03:56:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:47.110 --> 03:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
what are you what are you two as david
 
03:56:49.590 --> 03:56:49.600 align:start position:0%
scanlon likes to say when you've won
 
03:56:49.600 --> 03:56:50.830 align:start position:0%
scanlon likes to say when you've won
stop

03:56:50.830 --> 03:56:50.840 align:start position:0%
stop
 
03:56:53.750 --> 03:56:53.760 align:start position:0%
talking okay good this is very helpful
 
03:56:58.550 --> 03:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:59.910 --> 03:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
so there's the amendment we have to
 
03:57:01.670 --> 03:57:01.680 align:start position:0%
speak to but then once it passes we have
 
03:57:03.429 --> 03:57:03.439 align:start position:0%
to speak to the bill itself correct we
 
03:57:05.590 --> 03:57:05.600 align:start position:0%
have to speak to the bill as amended so
 
03:57:07.830 --> 03:57:07.840 align:start position:0%
again strategically one of the things to
 
03:57:07.840 --> 03:57:09.030 align:start position:0%
again strategically one of the things to
consider

03:57:09.030 --> 03:57:09.040 align:start position:0%
consider
 
03:57:11.590 --> 03:57:11.600 align:start position:0%
is maybe having represented leon
 
03:57:13.990 --> 03:57:14.000 align:start position:0%
do the pi and the amendment if you do
 
03:57:17.349 --> 03:57:17.359 align:start position:0%
the pi on the bill as amended
 
03:57:19.030 --> 03:57:19.040 align:start position:0%
if we need it that's all
 
03:57:21.269 --> 03:57:21.279 align:start position:0%
okay representative webber gets the
 
03:57:24.870 --> 03:57:24.880 align:start position:0%
amendment adopted and you will do the pi
 
03:57:28.070 --> 03:57:28.080 align:start position:0%
on the amendment excuse me if needed
 
03:57:30.070 --> 03:57:30.080 align:start position:0%
and then speaking to the bill is
 
03:57:31.910 --> 03:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro and gay we hope
 
03:57:36.150 --> 03:57:36.160 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:41.910 --> 03:57:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:44.790 --> 03:57:44.800 align:start position:0%
okay i'm calling this very unofficial
 
03:57:48.070 --> 03:57:48.080 align:start position:0%
but very helpful thing to a close
 
03:57:53.910 --> 03:57:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:57:56.870 --> 03:57:56.880 align:start position:0%
uh here he is point of order
 
03:57:56.880 --> 03:57:57.830 align:start position:0%
uh here he is point of order
yes

03:57:57.830 --> 03:57:57.840 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:57:59.910 --> 03:57:59.920 align:start position:0%
is there is there some
 
03:58:03.189 --> 03:58:03.199 align:start position:0%
way we determine if representative
 
03:58:05.189 --> 03:58:05.199 align:start position:0%
gay speaks first or i speak first it
 
03:58:06.950 --> 03:58:06.960 align:start position:0%
would just determine which you know what
 
03:58:08.950 --> 03:58:08.960 align:start position:0%
i what we say well why don't you do we
 
03:58:10.469 --> 03:58:10.479 align:start position:0%
just decided once you figure out what
 
03:58:13.110 --> 03:58:13.120 align:start position:0%
you want because i have to turn this in
 
03:58:15.830 --> 03:58:15.840 align:start position:0%
so they write the script so rock paper
 
03:58:18.950 --> 03:58:18.960 align:start position:0%
scissors afterwards let me know okay
 
03:58:20.309 --> 03:58:20.319 align:start position:0%
well that's that's
 
03:58:22.870 --> 03:58:22.880 align:start position:0%
childish rock paper and scissors is more
 
03:58:22.880 --> 03:58:27.189 align:start position:0%
childish rock paper and scissors is more
courtly

03:58:27.189 --> 03:58:27.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:30.309 --> 03:58:30.319 align:start position:0%
is that is that rate choice voting no
 
03:58:33.510 --> 03:58:33.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:35.910 --> 03:58:35.920 align:start position:0%
okay we are getting
 
03:58:38.870 --> 03:58:38.880 align:start position:0%
even more off track than we're known for
 
03:58:42.070 --> 03:58:42.080 align:start position:0%
uh open the hearing on senate bill 288
 
03:58:44.469 --> 03:58:44.479 align:start position:0%
establishing a committee to study the
 
03:58:46.710 --> 03:58:46.720 align:start position:0%
listing of immunizations for children
 
03:58:51.189 --> 03:58:51.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:53.910 --> 03:58:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chair well hi committee how
 
03:58:55.429 --> 03:58:55.439 align:start position:0%
are you for the record i'm senator kevin
 
03:58:55.439 --> 03:58:56.469 align:start position:0%
are you for the record i'm senator kevin
avard

03:58:56.469 --> 03:58:56.479 align:start position:0%
avard
 
03:58:59.429 --> 03:58:59.439 align:start position:0%
and i am the prime sponsor of this bill
 
03:58:59.439 --> 03:59:01.429 align:start position:0%
and i am the prime sponsor of this bill
uh

03:59:01.429 --> 03:59:01.439 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:01.439 --> 03:59:02.469 align:start position:0%
uh
so

03:59:02.469 --> 03:59:02.479 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:59:05.590 --> 03:59:05.600 align:start position:0%
uh originally a a host of my
 
03:59:05.600 --> 03:59:07.750 align:start position:0%
uh originally a a host of my
constituents

03:59:07.750 --> 03:59:07.760 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
03:59:09.990 --> 03:59:10.000 align:start position:0%
uh do i did i introduce myself right
 
03:59:11.830 --> 03:59:11.840 align:start position:0%
yeah i did right yeah i'm just chewing
 
03:59:14.150 --> 03:59:14.160 align:start position:0%
on the word host i was thinking panoply
 
03:59:15.750 --> 03:59:15.760 align:start position:0%
but hosting yeah
 
03:59:18.229 --> 03:59:18.239 align:start position:0%
a host of my constituents
 
03:59:19.830 --> 03:59:19.840 align:start position:0%
uh had called because they were worried
 
03:59:22.710 --> 03:59:22.720 align:start position:0%
about the mandates and a whole host of
 
03:59:22.720 --> 03:59:23.670 align:start position:0%
about the mandates and a whole host of
uh

03:59:23.670 --> 03:59:23.680 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:59:26.389 --> 03:59:26.399 align:start position:0%
reasons why they wanted the the original
 
03:59:27.590 --> 03:59:27.600 align:start position:0%
bill put in
 
03:59:28.870 --> 03:59:28.880 align:start position:0%
uh they didn't want the schools to
 
03:59:31.590 --> 03:59:31.600 align:start position:0%
mandate the the vaccines and there was a
 
03:59:33.990 --> 03:59:34.000 align:start position:0%
mirror bill in the house
 
03:59:36.150 --> 03:59:36.160 align:start position:0%
very similar so we had a lot of people
 
03:59:38.070 --> 03:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
that were really concerned
 
03:59:39.590 --> 03:59:39.600 align:start position:0%
and they called up and they said would
 
03:59:41.429 --> 03:59:41.439 align:start position:0%
you put in a bill so i agreed to put in
 
03:59:42.790 --> 03:59:42.800 align:start position:0%
the bill
 
03:59:45.269 --> 03:59:45.279 align:start position:0%
and in the hearing uh we heard again a
 
03:59:48.389 --> 03:59:48.399 align:start position:0%
lot of testimony uh in favor uh and
 
03:59:49.670 --> 03:59:49.680 align:start position:0%
there then there were some that were
 
03:59:51.990 --> 03:59:52.000 align:start position:0%
opposed and then uh came out that well
 
03:59:53.510 --> 03:59:53.520 align:start position:0%
you know you can't
 
03:59:55.670 --> 03:59:55.680 align:start position:0%
restrict the schools you can't require
 
03:59:58.070 --> 03:59:58.080 align:start position:0%
it in the first place it's hhs
 
04:00:00.389 --> 04:00:00.399 align:start position:0%
and so there was an amendment that was
 
04:00:02.309 --> 04:00:02.319 align:start position:0%
brought in and then finally another
 
04:00:04.550 --> 04:00:04.560 align:start position:0%
amendment which we compromised and i
 
04:00:06.070 --> 04:00:06.080 align:start position:0%
think what we have right now is just a
 
04:00:06.080 --> 04:00:07.670 align:start position:0%
think what we have right now is just a
study

04:00:07.670 --> 04:00:07.680 align:start position:0%
study
 
04:00:09.030 --> 04:00:09.040 align:start position:0%
there's a study
 
04:00:10.150 --> 04:00:10.160 align:start position:0%
so that
 
04:00:12.630 --> 04:00:12.640 align:start position:0%
legislators like myself
 
04:00:15.750 --> 04:00:15.760 align:start position:0%
and and abroad will have a better grasp
 
04:00:17.429 --> 04:00:17.439 align:start position:0%
on how we're coming to get these
 
04:00:19.750 --> 04:00:19.760 align:start position:0%
vaccines how they're coming into play
 
04:00:21.429 --> 04:00:21.439 align:start position:0%
who's responsible for him who's the
 
04:00:23.670 --> 04:00:23.680 align:start position:0%
decision making on that the whole nine
 
04:00:26.469 --> 04:00:26.479 align:start position:0%
yards and so we did this in energy a
 
04:00:28.389 --> 04:00:28.399 align:start position:0%
while back because i had no clue about
 
04:00:30.309 --> 04:00:30.319 align:start position:0%
energy and i was really
 
04:00:31.910 --> 04:00:31.920 align:start position:0%
confident that i had no clue about
 
04:00:31.920 --> 04:00:33.110 align:start position:0%
confident that i had no clue about
energy

04:00:33.110 --> 04:00:33.120 align:start position:0%
energy
 
04:00:33.120 --> 04:00:33.910 align:start position:0%
energy
and

04:00:33.910 --> 04:00:33.920 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:36.790 --> 04:00:36.800 align:start position:0%
so what we did is we had a study
 
04:00:38.710 --> 04:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
committee and the study committee
 
04:00:42.070 --> 04:00:42.080 align:start position:0%
basically talked about how uh you know
 
04:00:44.469 --> 04:00:44.479 align:start position:0%
we talk about generation we talk about
 
04:00:44.479 --> 04:00:45.830 align:start position:0%
we talk about generation we talk about
transmission

04:00:45.830 --> 04:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
transmission
 
04:00:45.840 --> 04:00:46.950 align:start position:0%
transmission
and

04:00:46.950 --> 04:00:46.960 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:00:49.750 --> 04:00:49.760 align:start position:0%
it educated the chair of the committee
 
04:00:51.510 --> 04:00:51.520 align:start position:0%
to be fair
 
04:00:54.150 --> 04:00:54.160 align:start position:0%
and so i put in this bill thinking well
 
04:00:55.910 --> 04:00:55.920 align:start position:0%
that that it was the schools that
 
04:00:57.670 --> 04:00:57.680 align:start position:0%
actually mandated these things so what
 
04:00:57.680 --> 04:00:58.870 align:start position:0%
actually mandated these things so what
i'm

04:00:58.870 --> 04:00:58.880 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
04:01:01.269 --> 04:01:01.279 align:start position:0%
this is an educational bill for me and
 
04:01:03.030 --> 04:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
for a host of other people that that
 
04:01:05.110 --> 04:01:05.120 align:start position:0%
want to come to grips with all right
 
04:01:07.030 --> 04:01:07.040 align:start position:0%
what's what's out there because
 
04:01:08.950 --> 04:01:08.960 align:start position:0%
it has been politicized
 
04:01:11.349 --> 04:01:11.359 align:start position:0%
we know that the whole idea of vaccines
 
04:01:12.630 --> 04:01:12.640 align:start position:0%
and so let's get to the truth of the
 
04:01:15.030 --> 04:01:15.040 align:start position:0%
matter let's let's sit down
 
04:01:18.550 --> 04:01:18.560 align:start position:0%
let's set back take a deep breath
 
04:01:21.030 --> 04:01:21.040 align:start position:0%
and find out really
 
04:01:23.510 --> 04:01:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know what are what's the role of the
 
04:01:23.520 --> 04:01:38.710 align:start position:0%
you know what are what's the role of the
government

04:01:38.710 --> 04:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:41.510 --> 04:01:41.520 align:start position:0%
you are forgiven
 
04:01:44.870 --> 04:01:44.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:01:47.349 --> 04:01:47.359 align:start position:0%
so that's a pretty high penance senator
 
04:01:49.269 --> 04:01:49.279 align:start position:0%
uh so really that's the essence of the
 
04:01:51.269 --> 04:01:51.279 align:start position:0%
bill and i'm hoping to be the chair of
 
04:01:52.550 --> 04:01:52.560 align:start position:0%
it and uh
 
04:01:54.870 --> 04:01:54.880 align:start position:0%
i think if any of you known and have any
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
history with me on on any committee
 
04:01:58.950 --> 04:01:58.960 align:start position:0%
i'm fair
 
04:02:00.150 --> 04:02:00.160 align:start position:0%
and i want to get to the truth of the
 
04:02:00.160 --> 04:02:01.030 align:start position:0%
and i want to get to the truth of the
matter

04:02:01.030 --> 04:02:01.040 align:start position:0%
matter
 
04:02:02.870 --> 04:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
and i want to get to the truth i want to
 
04:02:05.750 --> 04:02:05.760 align:start position:0%
get beyond all the
 
04:02:08.229 --> 04:02:08.239 align:start position:0%
garbage that's out there uh i want to
 
04:02:10.150 --> 04:02:10.160 align:start position:0%
know what's what what the what the rules
 
04:02:12.469 --> 04:02:12.479 align:start position:0%
are of engagement and so let's let's do
 
04:02:16.870 --> 04:02:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:19.910 --> 04:02:19.920 align:start position:0%
would you believe yes i would
 
04:02:22.710 --> 04:02:22.720 align:start position:0%
i'm under orders to kill this bill
 
04:02:22.720 --> 04:02:24.150 align:start position:0%
i'm under orders to kill this bill
from

04:02:24.150 --> 04:02:24.160 align:start position:0%
from
 
04:02:27.189 --> 04:02:27.199 align:start position:0%
for one very important reason
 
04:02:28.389 --> 04:02:28.399 align:start position:0%
although we have
 
04:02:28.399 --> 04:02:29.750 align:start position:0%
although we have
400

04:02:29.750 --> 04:02:29.760 align:start position:0%
400
 
04:02:32.309 --> 04:02:32.319 align:start position:0%
members of the house
 
04:02:34.550 --> 04:02:34.560 align:start position:0%
the kinds of folks who are able and
 
04:02:37.349 --> 04:02:37.359 align:start position:0%
willing to serve on committees
 
04:02:39.910 --> 04:02:39.920 align:start position:0%
is a lot less than that
 
04:02:39.920 --> 04:02:40.790 align:start position:0%
is a lot less than that
and

04:02:40.790 --> 04:02:40.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:02:42.309 --> 04:02:42.319 align:start position:0%
in any committee that's being
 
04:02:42.319 --> 04:02:43.910 align:start position:0%
in any committee that's being
established

04:02:43.910 --> 04:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
established
 
04:02:45.830 --> 04:02:45.840 align:start position:0%
out of this group
 
04:02:47.510 --> 04:02:47.520 align:start position:0%
and indeed now out of some other
 
04:02:47.520 --> 04:02:48.870 align:start position:0%
and indeed now out of some other
committees

04:02:48.870 --> 04:02:48.880 align:start position:0%
committees
 
04:02:50.630 --> 04:02:50.640 align:start position:0%
the speaker's office
 
04:02:52.550 --> 04:02:52.560 align:start position:0%
tasks me
 
04:02:56.389 --> 04:02:56.399 align:start position:0%
with finding the people to serve
 
04:02:58.710 --> 04:02:58.720 align:start position:0%
and it is an increasingly difficult
 
04:02:58.720 --> 04:02:59.910 align:start position:0%
and it is an increasingly difficult
thing

04:02:59.910 --> 04:02:59.920 align:start position:0%
thing
 
04:03:01.990 --> 04:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
so the little side deals i'm working
 
04:03:03.830 --> 04:03:03.840 align:start position:0%
with numbers of your senatorial
 
04:03:07.429 --> 04:03:07.439 align:start position:0%

long a period of time do you expect this
 
04:04:21.590 --> 04:04:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:23.590 --> 04:04:23.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's a it's a study committee so it
 
04:04:27.110 --> 04:04:27.120 align:start position:0%
has to be over uh this year so uh
 
04:04:29.750 --> 04:04:29.760 align:start position:0%
yeah december 1 2022
 
04:04:31.990 --> 04:04:32.000 align:start position:0%

it's it's pigeon hebrew
 
04:05:02.550 --> 04:05:02.560 align:start position:0%
so we've got leon conner cofault and
 
04:05:04.550 --> 04:05:04.560 align:start position:0%
soloway there's a breath right there

in support of what you just said a
 
04:05:21.830 --> 04:05:21.840 align:start position:0%
little a little while ago
 
04:05:24.150 --> 04:05:24.160 align:start position:0%
about the speaker
 
04:05:26.229 --> 04:05:26.239 align:start position:0%
i i'm aware of the fact that we have
 
04:05:26.239 --> 04:05:27.349 align:start position:0%
i i'm aware of the fact that we have
several

04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
several
 
04:05:27.359 --> 04:05:28.790 align:start position:0%
several
thousand

04:05:28.790 --> 04:05:28.800 align:start position:0%
thousand
 
04:05:31.269 --> 04:05:31.279 align:start position:0%
committees slash commissions
 
04:05:33.429 --> 04:05:33.439 align:start position:0%
that haven't haven't even met for two
 
04:05:33.439 --> 04:05:34.389 align:start position:0%
that haven't haven't even met for two
years

04:05:34.389 --> 04:05:34.399 align:start position:0%
years
 
04:05:38.950 --> 04:05:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
04:05:41.670 --> 04:05:41.680 align:start position:0%
truly noted if i may make a comment you
 
04:05:43.750 --> 04:05:43.760 align:start position:0%
may make a comment
 
04:05:45.189 --> 04:05:45.199 align:start position:0%
when i put in my study bills for the
 
04:05:47.189 --> 04:05:47.199 align:start position:0%
energy we had a lot of resistance from
 
04:05:49.990 --> 04:05:50.000 align:start position:0%
both sides i like that resistance and i
 
04:05:50.000 --> 04:05:51.030 align:start position:0%
both sides i like that resistance and i
remember

04:05:51.030 --> 04:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
remember
 
04:05:52.870 --> 04:05:52.880 align:start position:0%
some of my colleagues on on the other
 
04:05:54.070 --> 04:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
side of the aisle said i'm not going to
 
04:05:55.429 --> 04:05:55.439 align:start position:0%
teach him anything
 
04:05:55.439 --> 04:05:56.630 align:start position:0%
teach him anything
and

04:05:56.630 --> 04:05:56.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:05:58.950 --> 04:05:58.960 align:start position:0%
that's right but you know what they're
 
04:06:00.710 --> 04:06:00.720 align:start position:0%
very happy they did
 
04:06:03.590 --> 04:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
because i'm a good chairman of energy
 
04:06:05.670 --> 04:06:05.680 align:start position:0%
because of it i got a reward from it an
 
04:06:07.269 --> 04:06:07.279 align:start position:0%
award the other day
 
04:06:09.830 --> 04:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
um more power to you sir this will get
 
04:06:09.840 --> 04:06:10.790 align:start position:0%
um more power to you sir this will get
done

04:06:10.790 --> 04:06:10.800 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:06:12.790 --> 04:06:12.800 align:start position:0%
this will get done it'll get be done in
 
04:06:14.389 --> 04:06:14.399 align:start position:0%
a time of the fashion
 
04:06:16.950 --> 04:06:16.960 align:start position:0%
and uh we'll get some results
 
04:06:18.870 --> 04:06:18.880 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
04:06:20.870 --> 04:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes i i had more of a question actually
 
04:06:22.150 --> 04:06:22.160 align:start position:0%
because although i appreciate the
 
04:06:24.870 --> 04:06:24.880 align:start position:0%
concept i was wondering um thinking
 
04:06:27.110 --> 04:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
about how we handle a lot of bills over
 
04:06:29.030 --> 04:06:29.040 align:start position:0%
this year many of them came in as
 
04:06:31.110 --> 04:06:31.120 align:start position:0%
coveted 19 bills went out as more
 
04:06:33.590 --> 04:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
generic bills and this one ref
 
04:06:35.349 --> 04:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
specifically references how they make
 
04:06:37.030 --> 04:06:37.040 align:start position:0%
decisions about cobit 19. now more
 
04:06:38.389 --> 04:06:38.399 align:start position:0%
importantly in the
 
04:06:41.750 --> 04:06:41.760 align:start position:0%
hearing for 1379 we were instructed that
 
04:06:44.790 --> 04:06:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh dhhs was not going to do anything
 
04:06:46.070 --> 04:06:46.080 align:start position:0%
about moving ahead with covert because
 
04:06:47.590 --> 04:06:47.600 align:start position:0%
they felt there wasn't sufficient
 
04:06:49.830 --> 04:06:49.840 align:start position:0%
evidence to mandate that in kids and
 
04:06:52.870 --> 04:06:52.880 align:start position:0%
under 1633 where we put in uh 33 third
 
04:06:55.429 --> 04:06:55.439 align:start position:0%
no sorry i said that wrong 1633 was that
 
04:06:57.670 --> 04:06:57.680 align:start position:0%
1379 was the bill that we have that has
 
04:06:59.990 --> 04:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
to do with how the system works
 
04:07:02.630 --> 04:07:02.640 align:start position:0%
and uh that goes to oversight
 
04:07:04.790 --> 04:07:04.800 align:start position:0%
um so the question is do we really need
 
04:07:06.229 --> 04:07:06.239 align:start position:0%
a study committee
 
04:07:08.469 --> 04:07:08.479 align:start position:0%
to look at this when we
 
04:07:09.830 --> 04:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
have now
 
04:07:12.150 --> 04:07:12.160 align:start position:0%
uh oversight committee needing to vote
 
04:07:15.510 --> 04:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
with a three-fifths vote so every time a
 
04:07:17.349 --> 04:07:17.359 align:start position:0%
an immunization would come up it's going
 
04:07:19.510 --> 04:07:19.520 align:start position:0%
to come before oversight so that's going
 
04:07:21.269 --> 04:07:21.279 align:start position:0%
to be an ongoing sort of committee to
 
04:07:22.630 --> 04:07:22.640 align:start position:0%
look at it
 
04:07:23.670 --> 04:07:23.680 align:start position:0%
now that's not something you would have
 
04:07:24.950 --> 04:07:24.960 align:start position:0%
known when you filed this but does that
 
04:07:27.110 --> 04:07:27.120 align:start position:0%
make this perhaps not even necessary to
 
04:07:28.870 --> 04:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
have a committee no i definitely
 
04:07:30.710 --> 04:07:30.720 align:start position:0%
disagree i think because there's still
 
04:07:33.750 --> 04:07:33.760 align:start position:0%
ongoing issues with with
 
04:07:36.630 --> 04:07:36.640 align:start position:0%
information out there and misinformation
 
04:07:39.030 --> 04:07:39.040 align:start position:0%
with regard to covet and with regards to
 
04:07:39.040 --> 04:07:39.670 align:start position:0%
with regard to covet and with regards to
the

04:07:39.670 --> 04:07:39.680 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:07:40.950 --> 04:07:40.960 align:start position:0%
the uh
 
04:07:42.630 --> 04:07:42.640 align:start position:0%
the obligations of the cities and
 
04:07:46.149 --> 04:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
municipalities in the state and i think
 
04:07:48.550 --> 04:07:48.560 align:start position:0%
we can clarify uh
 
04:07:51.269 --> 04:07:51.279 align:start position:0%
you know
 
04:07:52.550 --> 04:07:52.560 align:start position:0%
the people
 
04:07:54.309 --> 04:07:54.319 align:start position:0%
if you shut it down
 
04:07:56.229 --> 04:07:56.239 align:start position:0%
if you shut down the conversation it's
 
04:07:58.710 --> 04:07:58.720 align:start position:0%
not going to help the people
 
04:08:02.070 --> 04:08:02.080 align:start position:0%
this this will help the people uh
 
04:08:03.910 --> 04:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
and it'll help their legislators to have
 
04:08:06.630 --> 04:08:06.640 align:start position:0%
a clear understanding as to the role
 
04:08:06.640 --> 04:08:07.910 align:start position:0%
a clear understanding as to the role
of

04:08:07.910 --> 04:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
of
 
04:08:09.590 --> 04:08:09.600 align:start position:0%
of the municipal
 
04:08:12.070 --> 04:08:12.080 align:start position:0%
the state uh with regards to what this
 
04:08:13.670 --> 04:08:13.680 align:start position:0%
is because i can tell you right now if
 
04:08:16.070 --> 04:08:16.080 align:start position:0%
you shut down the conversation it all it
 
04:08:18.870 --> 04:08:18.880 align:start position:0%
does is it fuels the fire
 
04:08:18.880 --> 04:08:20.309 align:start position:0%
does is it fuels the fire
representative

04:08:20.309 --> 04:08:20.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:08:21.910 --> 04:08:21.920 align:start position:0%
but my intention though if you'd
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
appreciate it but would you believe was
 
04:08:24.710 --> 04:08:24.720 align:start position:0%
not to shut it down but just simply
 
04:08:26.309 --> 04:08:26.319 align:start position:0%
saying since we now have a mechanism
 
04:08:28.870 --> 04:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
with the uh health and human health
 
04:08:30.070 --> 04:08:30.080 align:start position:0%
human over
 
04:08:31.990 --> 04:08:32.000 align:start position:0%
sorry the oversight committee needing to
 
04:08:34.149 --> 04:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
look at each one individually
 
04:08:35.670 --> 04:08:35.680 align:start position:0%
that it would not really shut it down it
 
04:08:37.189 --> 04:08:37.199 align:start position:0%
already has a venue that would you
 
04:08:38.630 --> 04:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
believe that that was what i meant not
 
04:08:40.309 --> 04:08:40.319 align:start position:0%
to shut down but to say that there's
 
04:08:41.750 --> 04:08:41.760 align:start position:0%
another alternative venue already
 
04:08:41.760 --> 04:08:43.429 align:start position:0%
another alternative venue already
existing

04:08:43.429 --> 04:08:43.439 align:start position:0%
existing
 
04:08:45.189 --> 04:08:45.199 align:start position:0%
um that there might be some truth in
 
04:08:47.269 --> 04:08:47.279 align:start position:0%
that statement however i think that the
 
04:08:49.750 --> 04:08:49.760 align:start position:0%
people will uh will will appreciate the
 
04:08:51.910 --> 04:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
fact that uh we're taking a sober look
 
04:08:53.349 --> 04:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
at this
 
04:08:55.590 --> 04:08:55.600 align:start position:0%
instead of oversight i can tell you that
 
04:08:57.590 --> 04:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
oversight looks at this from the long
 
04:09:00.389 --> 04:09:00.399 align:start position:0%
perspective this is short
 
04:09:00.399 --> 04:09:01.750 align:start position:0%
perspective this is short
concise

04:09:01.750 --> 04:09:01.760 align:start position:0%
concise
 
04:09:01.760 --> 04:09:02.950 align:start position:0%
concise
now

04:09:02.950 --> 04:09:02.960 align:start position:0%
now
 
04:09:05.030 --> 04:09:05.040 align:start position:0%
and then done so i see them as two
 
04:09:07.429 --> 04:09:07.439 align:start position:0%
different things with oversight picking
 
04:09:09.510 --> 04:09:09.520 align:start position:0%
up once this committee sunsets
 
04:09:11.110 --> 04:09:11.120 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
04:09:13.189 --> 04:09:13.199 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um i also think
 
04:09:14.389 --> 04:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
that our
 
04:09:16.149 --> 04:09:16.159 align:start position:0%
would it be presumptuous for our
 
04:09:19.510 --> 04:09:19.520 align:start position:0%
committee to assume that uh 1379 is
 
04:09:21.429 --> 04:09:21.439 align:start position:0%
definitely going to become law or would
 
04:09:23.510 --> 04:09:23.520 align:start position:0%
it make more sense for us to have this
 
04:09:25.269 --> 04:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
study committee point of order i just
 
04:09:26.630 --> 04:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
found out that went to interim study in
 
04:09:28.790 --> 04:09:28.800 align:start position:0%
the senate so i have to withdraw the
 
04:09:31.110 --> 04:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
comment m8 1379 does not exist as a
 
04:09:34.790 --> 04:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:36.790 --> 04:09:36.800 align:start position:0%
well that was quick you ask it and it's
 
04:09:36.800 --> 04:09:37.590 align:start position:0%
well that was quick you ask it and it's
done

04:09:37.590 --> 04:09:37.600 align:start position:0%
done
 
04:09:37.600 --> 04:09:38.630 align:start position:0%
done
and

04:09:38.630 --> 04:09:38.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
04:09:43.429 --> 04:09:43.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:09:46.229 --> 04:09:46.239 align:start position:0%
first i have a couple comments senator
 
04:09:47.990 --> 04:09:48.000 align:start position:0%
first of all i want to commend you for
 
04:09:49.830 --> 04:09:49.840 align:start position:0%
ensuring that both parties represented
 
04:09:51.910 --> 04:09:51.920 align:start position:0%
on the commission i think it's healthy
 
04:09:54.550 --> 04:09:54.560 align:start position:0%
for any commission to actually have any
 
04:09:56.389 --> 04:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
um it's not a commission it's a study
 
04:09:58.469 --> 04:09:58.479 align:start position:0%
study committee
 
04:10:00.229 --> 04:10:00.239 align:start position:0%
number two
 
04:10:01.269 --> 04:10:01.279 align:start position:0%
it's going to bring up the question
 
04:10:02.710 --> 04:10:02.720 align:start position:0%
about the um
 
04:10:04.469 --> 04:10:04.479 align:start position:0%
house bill that was recently
 
04:10:06.229 --> 04:10:06.239 align:start position:0%
sent to interim study
 
04:10:08.070 --> 04:10:08.080 align:start position:0%
that that was basically looking at if
 
04:10:09.110 --> 04:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
you will
 
04:10:11.670 --> 04:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
vaccines to be added to we had a clause
 
04:10:12.630 --> 04:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
in there
 
04:10:14.070 --> 04:10:14.080 align:start position:0%
i think this is a great compromise
 
04:10:15.510 --> 04:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
because one of the things they heard it
 
04:10:16.950 --> 04:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
through this committee
 
04:10:19.429 --> 04:10:19.439 align:start position:0%
was a need for legislative oversight
 
04:10:20.950 --> 04:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
on what the vaccines are what the
 
04:10:22.229 --> 04:10:22.239 align:start position:0%
requirements are
 
04:10:23.830 --> 04:10:23.840 align:start position:0%
and this kind of threads the needle
 
04:10:26.149 --> 04:10:26.159 align:start position:0%
because it does provide a mechanism
 
04:10:26.159 --> 04:10:27.590 align:start position:0%
because it does provide a mechanism
legislatively

04:10:27.590 --> 04:10:27.600 align:start position:0%
legislatively
 
04:10:29.750 --> 04:10:29.760 align:start position:0%
to look at this issue and then provide
 
04:10:32.070 --> 04:10:32.080 align:start position:0%
some sort of guidance for policy making
 
04:10:34.710 --> 04:10:34.720 align:start position:0%
in the future so would you believe that
 
04:10:36.710 --> 04:10:36.720 align:start position:0%
i agree with you
 
04:10:37.990 --> 04:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
i would definitely believe that and i
 
04:10:39.510 --> 04:10:39.520 align:start position:0%
thank you for your comments and i i
 
04:10:41.590 --> 04:10:41.600 align:start position:0%
think um really i
 
04:10:43.590 --> 04:10:43.600 align:start position:0%
if if you know me if you know my i
 
04:10:45.110 --> 04:10:45.120 align:start position:0%
really like to give the people the
 
04:10:47.189 --> 04:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
opportunity to know that we're actually
 
04:10:49.429 --> 04:10:49.439 align:start position:0%
working on their behalf and uh i don't
 
04:10:51.349 --> 04:10:51.359 align:start position:0%
like to shut down the conversation
 
04:10:54.309 --> 04:10:54.319 align:start position:0%
because the legislature knows best
 
04:10:55.990 --> 04:10:56.000 align:start position:0%
one of the things that's
 
04:10:58.950 --> 04:10:58.960 align:start position:0%
grabbed me through the pandemic
 
04:11:00.630 --> 04:11:00.640 align:start position:0%
is while there's always certain people
 
04:11:02.229 --> 04:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
who are just going to believe and act
 
04:11:04.710 --> 04:11:04.720 align:start position:0%
the way they are no matter what
 
04:11:06.550 --> 04:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
many other people
 
04:11:09.189 --> 04:11:09.199 align:start position:0%
like the opportunity to be heard it's a
 
04:11:11.510 --> 04:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
safety valve even if ultimately the
 
04:11:13.670 --> 04:11:13.680 align:start position:0%
decision goes differently at least they
 
04:11:15.510 --> 04:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
feel like they've been heard and i see
 
04:11:17.750 --> 04:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
this as a vehicle to do that and if i
 
04:11:20.469 --> 04:11:20.479 align:start position:0%
may mr chair the the fact that uh
 
04:11:22.070 --> 04:11:22.080 align:start position:0%
it is going to be bipartisan you're
 
04:11:24.389 --> 04:11:24.399 align:start position:0%
familiar with the phrase iron sharpens
 
04:11:24.399 --> 04:11:25.590 align:start position:0%
familiar with the phrase iron sharpens
honor

04:11:25.590 --> 04:11:25.600 align:start position:0%
honor
 
04:11:28.550 --> 04:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
and strong debate uh in
 
04:11:32.710 --> 04:11:32.720 align:start position:0%
really having some very qualified people
 
04:11:35.269 --> 04:11:35.279 align:start position:0%
i'm already looking at them that
 
04:11:35.279 --> 04:11:36.229 align:start position:0%
i'm already looking at them that
that

04:11:36.229 --> 04:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
that
 
04:11:39.510 --> 04:11:39.520 align:start position:0%
that are very very uh
 
04:11:41.830 --> 04:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
they're above my pay grade
 
04:11:43.990 --> 04:11:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i i need to hear it and i need to to
 
04:11:46.950 --> 04:11:46.960 align:start position:0%
let the people um
 
04:11:46.960 --> 04:11:48.229 align:start position:0%
let the people um
here

04:11:48.229 --> 04:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
here
 
04:11:49.510 --> 04:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
and and and go through all this
 
04:11:51.990 --> 04:11:52.000 align:start position:0%
information because there's a ton out
 
04:11:52.000 --> 04:11:52.790 align:start position:0%
information because there's a ton out
there

04:11:52.790 --> 04:11:52.800 align:start position:0%
there
 
04:11:54.870 --> 04:11:54.880 align:start position:0%
and everybody's an expert
 
04:11:54.880 --> 04:11:56.389 align:start position:0%
and everybody's an expert
so

04:11:56.389 --> 04:11:56.399 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:11:58.149 --> 04:11:58.159 align:start position:0%
anyway i see you got your hand up so
 
04:11:59.830 --> 04:11:59.840 align:start position:0%
representative kanark
 
04:12:01.750 --> 04:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
yes would you believe that
 
04:12:03.590 --> 04:12:03.600 align:start position:0%
your commitment to fairness is nicely
 
04:12:05.269 --> 04:12:05.279 align:start position:0%
demonstrated by the fact that you made
 
04:12:07.110 --> 04:12:07.120 align:start position:0%
it two members of the senate for the
 
04:12:08.389 --> 04:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
house representative so it's an even
 
04:12:09.990 --> 04:12:10.000 align:start position:0%
number which means one party cannot
 
04:12:12.790 --> 04:12:12.800 align:start position:0%
dominate good sign it's the kind of guy
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:21.349 --> 04:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:25.349 --> 04:12:25.359 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:28.550 --> 04:12:28.560 align:start position:0%
seeing no pink cards oh my goodness
 
04:12:32.469 --> 04:12:32.479 align:start position:0%
i mean none are needed hey close the uh
 
04:12:33.750 --> 04:12:33.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
04:12:35.750 --> 04:12:35.760 align:start position:0%
288 and while he's still in the room i
 
04:12:39.349 --> 04:12:39.359 align:start position:0%
open the exact session on the same 288
 
04:12:41.590 --> 04:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
and the chair looks at representative
 
04:12:44.469 --> 04:12:44.479 align:start position:0%
cofoult for a motion
 
04:12:46.630 --> 04:12:46.640 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman i move out to pass
 
04:12:49.990 --> 04:12:50.000 align:start position:0%
on senate bill 288 and somebody from the
 
04:12:55.750 --> 04:12:55.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:12:57.590 --> 04:12:57.600 align:start position:0%

and the use of digital health technology
 
04:40:27.190 --> 04:40:27.200 align:start position:0%
consumers have been and have embraced
 
04:40:29.430 --> 04:40:29.440 align:start position:0%
telemedicine and have come to expect it
 
04:40:31.430 --> 04:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
with surrounding states allowing for
 
04:40:33.430 --> 04:40:33.440 align:start position:0%
technology this legislation is seeking
 
04:40:35.110 --> 04:40:35.120 align:start position:0%
to enable
 
04:40:36.708 --> 04:40:36.718 align:start position:0%
this proposal will help new hampshire
 
04:40:38.788 --> 04:40:38.798 align:start position:0%
keep pace with surrounding states in
 
04:40:40.628 --> 04:40:40.638 align:start position:0%
utilizing other technology and
 
04:40:43.750 --> 04:40:43.760 align:start position:0%
modalities sp 390 attempts to take a
 
04:40:45.430 --> 04:40:45.440 align:start position:0%
precise approach
 
04:40:47.670 --> 04:40:47.680 align:start position:0%
to allow for the use of asynchronous
 
04:40:49.910 --> 04:40:49.920 align:start position:0%
technology in situations where where
 
04:40:52.868 --> 04:40:52.878 align:start position:0%
timely care and convenience are wanted
 
04:40:55.590 --> 04:40:55.600 align:start position:0%
and in-person care is not
 
04:40:55.600 --> 04:40:57.190 align:start position:0%
and in-person care is not
necessary

04:40:57.190 --> 04:40:57.200 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
04:40:59.350 --> 04:40:59.360 align:start position:0%
asynchronous telemedicine can be used
 
04:41:01.110 --> 04:41:01.120 align:start position:0%
for things like hair loss minus can
 
04:41:03.830 --> 04:41:03.840 align:start position:0%
rashes rashes etc and so this
 
04:41:05.670 --> 04:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
legislation doesn't make any changes to
 
04:41:07.510 --> 04:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance reimbursement and i
 
04:41:09.590 --> 04:41:09.600 align:start position:0%
believe that telehealth study commission
 
04:41:11.430 --> 04:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
is ongoing and has been looking at those
 
04:41:11.440 --> 04:41:12.470 align:start position:0%
is ongoing and has been looking at those
issues

04:41:12.470 --> 04:41:12.480 align:start position:0%
issues
 
04:41:14.310 --> 04:41:14.320 align:start position:0%
and is uh is the right form for
 
04:41:16.788 --> 04:41:16.798 align:start position:0%
discussion of any reimbursement changes
 
04:41:18.470 --> 04:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
during the senate process stakeholders
 
04:41:20.470 --> 04:41:20.480 align:start position:0%
worked on an amendment that addressed
 
04:41:22.550 --> 04:41:22.560 align:start position:0%
any concerns that were expressed during
 
04:41:24.150 --> 04:41:24.160 align:start position:0%
the hearing and the senate amendment
 
04:41:26.470 --> 04:41:26.480 align:start position:0%
ensured transparency for patients
 
04:41:28.070 --> 04:41:28.080 align:start position:0%
and made sure that the providers could
 
04:41:30.230 --> 04:41:30.240 align:start position:0%
determine what type of telemedicine was
 
04:41:30.240 --> 04:41:31.670 align:start position:0%
determine what type of telemedicine was
appropriate

04:41:31.670 --> 04:41:31.680 align:start position:0%
appropriate
 
04:41:34.310 --> 04:41:34.320 align:start position:0%
for their patients and i would um

total clarity uh for the providers using
 
04:42:06.150 --> 04:42:06.160 align:start position:0%
this telemedicine this bill actually was
 
04:42:07.510 --> 04:42:07.520 align:start position:0%
confused with another building not too
 
04:42:09.510 --> 04:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
long ago and um
 
04:42:11.670 --> 04:42:11.680 align:start position:0%
i've got a ton
 
04:42:13.750 --> 04:42:13.760 align:start position:0%
of emails and people calling up saying
 
04:42:16.628 --> 04:42:16.638 align:start position:0%
don't get rid of my telemedicine
 
04:42:18.390 --> 04:42:18.400 align:start position:0%
and i'm thinking wow i didn't realize
 
04:42:20.070 --> 04:42:20.080 align:start position:0%
there were so many people that were
 
04:42:24.628 --> 04:42:24.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:42:27.110 --> 04:42:27.120 align:start position:0%
technology i just i was really really
 
04:42:28.628 --> 04:42:28.638 align:start position:0%
surprised especially in the southern
 
04:42:30.788 --> 04:42:30.798 align:start position:0%
border of new hampshire
 
04:42:31.990 --> 04:42:32.000 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people that use
 
04:42:32.000 --> 04:42:33.270 align:start position:0%
there are a lot of people that use
telemedicine

04:42:33.270 --> 04:42:33.280 align:start position:0%
telemedicine
 
04:42:35.110 --> 04:42:35.120 align:start position:0%
and one of the benefits i think that
 
04:42:37.110 --> 04:42:37.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see is that you know we're all
 
04:42:39.270 --> 04:42:39.280 align:start position:0%
talking about mental health and how that
 
04:42:41.510 --> 04:42:41.520 align:start position:0%
there's a crisis and this is one way to
 
04:42:44.868 --> 04:42:44.878 align:start position:0%
expand uh some services for for that
 
04:42:47.430 --> 04:42:47.440 align:start position:0%
that area so and i i'm sure uh
 
04:42:48.868 --> 04:42:48.878 align:start position:0%
representative kaner can talk a little
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
bit more about things of that nature but
 
04:42:53.670 --> 04:42:53.680 align:start position:0%
it's it's really a simple fix and it's
 
04:42:56.788 --> 04:42:56.798 align:start position:0%
it's narrow in scope and so we hope that
 
04:43:00.470 --> 04:43:00.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:02.788 --> 04:43:02.798 align:start position:0%
senator your testimony that you read
 
04:43:04.390 --> 04:43:04.400 align:start position:0%
from would you have a copy that we could
 
04:43:06.868 --> 04:43:06.878 align:start position:0%
have yes thank you i plan on moving the
 
04:43:10.628 --> 04:43:10.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:13.590 --> 04:43:13.600 align:start position:0%
and by the way i am dyslexic
 
04:43:16.788 --> 04:43:16.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:18.708 --> 04:43:18.718 align:start position:0%
well we have to use other parts of our
 
04:43:18.718 --> 04:43:20.310 align:start position:0%
well we have to use other parts of our
brain

04:43:20.310 --> 04:43:20.320 align:start position:0%
brain
 
04:43:22.868 --> 04:43:22.878 align:start position:0%
we listen we listen
 
04:43:22.878 --> 04:43:24.868 align:start position:0%
we listen we listen
so

04:43:24.868 --> 04:43:24.878 align:start position:0%
so
 
04:43:26.628 --> 04:43:26.638 align:start position:0%
thank you i know you happen to believe
 
04:43:27.910 --> 04:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
in dog
 
04:43:31.430 --> 04:43:31.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:43:35.030 --> 04:43:35.040 align:start position:0%
yay verily i believe in god yeah
 
04:43:36.948 --> 04:43:36.958 align:start position:0%
representative natarapam
 
04:43:38.708 --> 04:43:38.718 align:start position:0%
would you believe
 
04:43:41.430 --> 04:43:41.440 align:start position:0%
when i had my endocrinology appointment
 
04:43:43.990 --> 04:43:44.000 align:start position:0%
sometime this winter by telemedicine
 
04:43:47.110 --> 04:43:47.120 align:start position:0%
that my provider said because of
 
04:43:50.070 --> 04:43:50.080 align:start position:0%
telemedicine her elderly diabetic
 
04:43:52.230 --> 04:43:52.240 align:start position:0%
patients who usually drop off and don't
 
04:43:53.990 --> 04:43:54.000 align:start position:0%
come for appointments during the winter
 
04:43:57.030 --> 04:43:57.040 align:start position:0%
because of transportation difficulties
 
04:43:57.040 --> 04:43:58.470 align:start position:0%
because of transportation difficulties
were

04:43:58.470 --> 04:43:58.480 align:start position:0%
were
 
04:44:00.310 --> 04:44:00.320 align:start position:0%
almost 100 percent there via
 
04:44:03.430 --> 04:44:03.440 align:start position:0%
telemedicine so i'm a great proponent of
 
04:44:07.350 --> 04:44:07.360 align:start position:0%
telemedicine and um for a lot of
 
04:44:09.030 --> 04:44:09.040 align:start position:0%
people with disabilities people with
 
04:44:11.910 --> 04:44:11.920 align:start position:0%
transportation troubles it just make or
 
04:44:11.920 --> 04:44:13.030 align:start position:0%
transportation troubles it just make or
time

04:44:13.030 --> 04:44:13.040 align:start position:0%
time
 
04:44:15.990 --> 04:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
constraints it makes great sense would
 
04:44:17.110 --> 04:44:17.120 align:start position:0%
you believe
 
04:44:18.628 --> 04:44:18.638 align:start position:0%
i believe and thank you for voting for
 
04:44:24.550 --> 04:44:24.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:44:26.868 --> 04:44:26.878 align:start position:0%
representative leon thank you mr
 
04:44:28.310 --> 04:44:28.320 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you senator for being
 
04:44:30.390 --> 04:44:30.400 align:start position:0%
with us this afternoon uh would you
 
04:44:32.948 --> 04:44:32.958 align:start position:0%
believe that some of the cardiac devices
 
04:44:35.350 --> 04:44:35.360 align:start position:0%
as well are able to keep the doctors
 
04:44:37.750 --> 04:44:37.760 align:start position:0%
appraised and even smart scales to check
 
04:44:39.590 --> 04:44:39.600 align:start position:0%
when people are swelling and to catch
 
04:44:41.350 --> 04:44:41.360 align:start position:0%
them ahead and would you believe that i
 
04:44:42.788 --> 04:44:42.798 align:start position:0%
think this is a great bill that will
 
04:44:45.030 --> 04:44:45.040 align:start position:0%
help get that access to our people i
 
04:44:46.788 --> 04:44:46.798 align:start position:0%
think we've all already established that
 
04:44:48.948 --> 04:44:48.958 align:start position:0%
i'm a believer
 
04:44:57.030 --> 04:44:57.040 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:01.750 --> 04:45:01.760 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:03.750 --> 04:45:03.760 align:start position:0%
all right thank you any more um
 
04:45:06.868 --> 04:45:06.878 align:start position:0%
questions for the senator
 
04:45:09.110 --> 04:45:09.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none the chair recognizes our
 
04:45:11.750 --> 04:45:11.760 align:start position:0%
very own representative jerry kanerk who
 
04:45:16.230 --> 04:45:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:18.550 --> 04:45:18.560 align:start position:0%
who has handout amendments
 
04:45:21.430 --> 04:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:28.708 --> 04:45:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:28.718 --> 04:45:44.150 align:start position:0%
 
bye

04:45:44.150 --> 04:45:44.160 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:46.390 --> 04:45:46.400 align:start position:0%
okay so for the record jerry carroll
 
04:45:47.830 --> 04:45:47.840 align:start position:0%
county district 3.
 
04:45:47.840 --> 04:45:48.788 align:start position:0%
county district 3.
um

04:45:48.788 --> 04:45:48.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:45:52.070 --> 04:45:52.080 align:start position:0%
so yeah i'm a co-sponsor on this bill um
 
04:45:53.590 --> 04:45:53.600 align:start position:0%
i was contacted
 
04:45:55.350 --> 04:45:55.360 align:start position:0%
regarding on behalf of a couple of the
 
04:45:57.750 --> 04:45:57.760 align:start position:0%
telehealth platforms that they had some
 
04:45:59.590 --> 04:45:59.600 align:start position:0%
concerns about some language
 
04:46:01.750 --> 04:46:01.760 align:start position:0%
but just linguistically it's kind of
 
04:46:03.350 --> 04:46:03.360 align:start position:0%
interesting if you can pull the bill out
 
04:46:05.990 --> 04:46:06.000 align:start position:0%
and look at lines 16-17
 
04:46:07.430 --> 04:46:07.440 align:start position:0%
remember when you have a series it's
 
04:46:09.670 --> 04:46:09.680 align:start position:0%
always good to be able to drop
 
04:46:11.350 --> 04:46:11.360 align:start position:0%
to isolate any one word and see if it
 
04:46:12.868 --> 04:46:12.878 align:start position:0%
makes sense so nothing in this section
 
04:46:15.270 --> 04:46:15.280 align:start position:0%
shall limit a provider's ability to
 
04:46:19.350 --> 04:46:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:21.030 --> 04:46:21.040 align:start position:0%
or the provider's ability to
 
04:46:21.040 --> 04:46:22.868 align:start position:0%
or the provider's ability to
consultation

04:46:22.868 --> 04:46:22.878 align:start position:0%
consultation
 
04:46:24.470 --> 04:46:24.480 align:start position:0%
you know so just grammatically it was
 
04:46:26.628 --> 04:46:26.638 align:start position:0%
poorly written but the issue is
 
04:46:28.948 --> 04:46:28.958 align:start position:0%
allowing the word assess so if you pull
 
04:46:32.390 --> 04:46:32.400 align:start position:0%
out now the amendment so again bill
 
04:46:35.030 --> 04:46:35.040 align:start position:0%
page 1 line 16.
 
04:46:35.040 --> 04:46:36.948 align:start position:0%
page 1 line 16.
amendment

04:46:36.948 --> 04:46:36.958 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:46:39.110 --> 04:46:39.120 align:start position:0%
is on line 5.
 
04:46:41.590 --> 04:46:41.600 align:start position:0%
it changes it to diagnose assess or
 
04:46:43.590 --> 04:46:43.600 align:start position:0%
treat things let's say you have
 
04:46:43.600 --> 04:46:50.070 align:start position:0%
treat things let's say you have
something

04:46:50.070 --> 04:46:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:52.310 --> 04:46:52.320 align:start position:0%
you're just doing rhythms and it's a
 
04:46:54.708 --> 04:46:54.718 align:start position:0%
monitoring and the person can then the
 
04:46:56.470 --> 04:46:56.480 align:start position:0%
cardiologist can look at that rhythm
 
04:46:58.788 --> 04:46:58.798 align:start position:0%
strip and do an assessment they're not
 
04:47:00.310 --> 04:47:00.320 align:start position:0%
doing a diagnosis you already got a
 
04:47:02.550 --> 04:47:02.560 align:start position:0%
diagnosis you're not doing a treatment
 
04:47:04.470 --> 04:47:04.480 align:start position:0%
but they are doing an assessment
 
04:47:06.948 --> 04:47:06.958 align:start position:0%
so the limitation there of
 
04:47:08.788 --> 04:47:08.798 align:start position:0%
determine the diagnosis consultation or
 
04:47:10.310 --> 04:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
treatment besides being grammatically
 
04:47:10.320 --> 04:47:11.590 align:start position:0%
treatment besides being grammatically
bizarre

04:47:11.590 --> 04:47:11.600 align:start position:0%
bizarre
 
04:47:13.190 --> 04:47:13.200 align:start position:0%
was too limiting and this by the way is
 
04:47:13.200 --> 04:47:14.150 align:start position:0%
was too limiting and this by the way is
the

04:47:14.150 --> 04:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:47:16.310 --> 04:47:16.320 align:start position:0%
uh is a new paragraph that is why it is
 
04:47:18.070 --> 04:47:18.080 align:start position:0%
not bolded
 
04:47:20.310 --> 04:47:20.320 align:start position:0%
so it is not currently in statute so i'm
 
04:47:21.990 --> 04:47:22.000 align:start position:0%
not changing what's in statute because
 
04:47:24.230 --> 04:47:24.240 align:start position:0%
it is a new paragraph already even
 
04:47:25.910 --> 04:47:25.920 align:start position:0%
though it is not bold
 
04:47:28.150 --> 04:47:28.160 align:start position:0%
so that just cleans up that linguistic
 
04:47:30.628 --> 04:47:30.638 align:start position:0%
mess and also makes it a little more
 
04:47:32.470 --> 04:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
consistent what we're really doing with
 
04:47:34.310 --> 04:47:34.320 align:start position:0%
asynchronous uh
 
04:47:36.550 --> 04:47:36.560 align:start position:0%
telehealth and by the way the cons the
 
04:47:37.830 --> 04:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
comment that was made about i might
 
04:47:39.830 --> 04:47:39.840 align:start position:0%
remember about telemedicine
 
04:47:43.430 --> 04:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
unfortunately i retired in 2015
 
04:47:45.270 --> 04:47:45.280 align:start position:0%
and we didn't have a telemedicine back
 
04:47:47.030 --> 04:47:47.040 align:start position:0%
then i made i used to spend two to three
 
04:47:48.628 --> 04:47:48.638 align:start position:0%
hours every night on telephone calls to
 
04:47:50.070 --> 04:47:50.080 align:start position:0%
patients but it was not called
 
04:47:51.670 --> 04:47:51.680 align:start position:0%
telemedicine it was called a telephone
 
04:47:53.670 --> 04:47:53.680 align:start position:0%
call and there was no compensation other
 
04:47:56.830 --> 04:47:56.840 align:start position:0%
than that uh we also then go to on the
 
04:48:00.628 --> 04:48:00.638 align:start position:0%
bill line uh sorry page one
 
04:48:02.230 --> 04:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
line twenty
 
04:48:04.070 --> 04:48:04.080 align:start position:0%
eight and twenty nine a health care
 
04:48:06.150 --> 04:48:06.160 align:start position:0%
practitioner shall complete a history
 
04:48:08.150 --> 04:48:08.160 align:start position:0%
the bold is the new language
 
04:48:10.788 --> 04:48:10.798 align:start position:0%
shall complete a shall complete
 
04:48:13.110 --> 04:48:13.120 align:start position:0%
but in any case they don't always have
 
04:48:14.948 --> 04:48:14.958 align:start position:0%
to complete a history
 
04:48:17.030 --> 04:48:17.040 align:start position:0%
they may for example have a patient who
 
04:48:19.350 --> 04:48:19.360 align:start position:0%
does an online history
 
04:48:22.390 --> 04:48:22.400 align:start position:0%
filling out a form or from a from a con
 
04:48:23.750 --> 04:48:23.760 align:start position:0%
they're doing a consultation and so
 
04:48:26.230 --> 04:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
their primary doc has provided a history
 
04:48:29.030 --> 04:48:29.040 align:start position:0%
and so instead the languages change too
 
04:48:32.390 --> 04:48:32.400 align:start position:0%
shall complete or review a history that
 
04:48:33.670 --> 04:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
allows them to be able to not
 
04:48:35.270 --> 04:48:35.280 align:start position:0%
necessarily have to take every word
 
04:48:37.670 --> 04:48:37.680 align:start position:0%
verbatim but they can review it though
 
04:48:37.680 --> 04:48:39.590 align:start position:0%
verbatim but they can review it though
anybody

04:48:39.590 --> 04:48:39.600 align:start position:0%
anybody
 
04:48:41.190 --> 04:48:41.200 align:start position:0%
those of us who are practitioners know
 
04:48:43.030 --> 04:48:43.040 align:start position:0%
that you don't trust somebody's history
 
04:48:44.550 --> 04:48:44.560 align:start position:0%
they may review it but they sure
 
04:48:46.788 --> 04:48:46.798 align:start position:0%
certainly should spend time confirming
 
04:48:48.788 --> 04:48:48.798 align:start position:0%
that the facts are correct
 
04:48:51.350 --> 04:48:51.360 align:start position:0%
that appears in a second place in the
 
04:48:51.360 --> 04:48:52.390 align:start position:0%
that appears in a second place in the
bill

04:48:52.390 --> 04:48:52.400 align:start position:0%
bill
 
04:48:56.150 --> 04:48:56.160 align:start position:0%
on page two on line 17
 
04:48:58.390 --> 04:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
so it is corrected in the amendment on
 
04:48:59.750 --> 04:48:59.760 align:start position:0%
page two
 
04:49:02.150 --> 04:49:02.160 align:start position:0%
on line five where once again instead of
 
04:49:03.750 --> 04:49:03.760 align:start position:0%
just complete a history it becomes
 
04:49:05.990 --> 04:49:06.000 align:start position:0%
complete or review a history
 
04:49:07.510 --> 04:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
so this amendment doesn't change
 
04:49:09.510 --> 04:49:09.520 align:start position:0%
anything in the standpoint of from the
 
04:49:12.470 --> 04:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
standpoint of the bill substantively it
 
04:49:16.470 --> 04:49:16.480 align:start position:0%
corrects poor grammar and it also allows
 
04:49:18.788 --> 04:49:18.798 align:start position:0%
or enables the asynchronous issue for
 
04:49:21.590 --> 04:49:21.600 align:start position:0%
assessment and the ability of a provider
 
04:49:23.030 --> 04:49:23.040 align:start position:0%
to review a history that has been
 
04:49:24.788 --> 04:49:24.798 align:start position:0%
previously provided rather than have to
 
04:49:26.948 --> 04:49:26.958 align:start position:0%
start from scratch
 
04:49:29.830 --> 04:49:29.840 align:start position:0%
so that's um and i've run this by rep
 
04:49:31.910 --> 04:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
senator avard he is happy with it we
 
04:49:33.830 --> 04:49:33.840 align:start position:0%
have no problems uh he had no problems
 
04:49:35.750 --> 04:49:35.760 align:start position:0%
with it i should say and it will it'll
 
04:49:37.430 --> 04:49:37.440 align:start position:0%
make it easier for the telehealth
 
04:49:40.230 --> 04:49:40.240 align:start position:0%
platforms to actually and um carry out
 
04:49:43.670 --> 04:49:43.680 align:start position:0%
the intention of this bill
 
04:49:45.430 --> 04:49:45.440 align:start position:0%
i like it when there's a lot of thought
 
04:49:47.670 --> 04:49:47.680 align:start position:0%
put into something i i'm not so happy
 
04:49:51.670 --> 04:49:51.680 align:start position:0%
with things that are jerry built
 
04:49:53.350 --> 04:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
would you take questions of course i'll
 
04:49:54.708 --> 04:49:54.718 align:start position:0%
take a question of course you will who
 
04:49:59.190 --> 04:49:59.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:50:00.380 --> 04:50:00.390 align:start position:0%
it's for my side
 
04:50:00.390 --> 04:50:02.470 align:start position:0%
it's for my side
[Laughter]

04:50:02.470 --> 04:50:02.480 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
04:50:04.390 --> 04:50:04.400 align:start position:0%
we tend to be harder on our own i know
 
04:50:06.708 --> 04:50:06.718 align:start position:0%
yes right representative shapiro thank
 
04:50:09.910 --> 04:50:09.920 align:start position:0%
you mr chairman i should have really um
 
04:50:14.550 --> 04:50:14.560 align:start position:0%
asked this of senator avard but i was um
 
04:50:16.390 --> 04:50:16.400 align:start position:0%
i was too embarrassed to say that i
 
04:50:17.830 --> 04:50:17.840 align:start position:0%
didn't really understand what this bill
 
04:50:20.948 --> 04:50:20.958 align:start position:0%
was doing so but i'll
 
04:50:22.948 --> 04:50:22.958 align:start position:0%
took me a little time to get used to
 
04:50:25.750 --> 04:50:25.760 align:start position:0%
that so it's the only thing that i
 
04:50:27.190 --> 04:50:27.200 align:start position:0%
understand there's a lot of grammar
 
04:50:29.350 --> 04:50:29.360 align:start position:0%
being changed a lot of wording
 
04:50:31.350 --> 04:50:31.360 align:start position:0%
and definitions but it's the only
 
04:50:33.270 --> 04:50:33.280 align:start position:0%
practical change that we're doing here
 
04:50:35.910 --> 04:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
with this bill is adding
 
04:50:37.350 --> 04:50:37.360 align:start position:0%
a synchronous
 
04:50:37.360 --> 04:50:38.550 align:start position:0%
a synchronous
um

04:50:38.550 --> 04:50:38.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:50:38.560 --> 04:50:39.910 align:start position:0%
um
telehealth

04:50:39.910 --> 04:50:39.920 align:start position:0%
telehealth
 
04:50:43.910 --> 04:50:43.920 align:start position:0%
to what already exists in statute um
 
04:50:43.920 --> 04:50:45.110 align:start position:0%
to what already exists in statute um
the

04:50:45.110 --> 04:50:45.120 align:start position:0%
the
 
04:50:47.270 --> 04:50:47.280 align:start position:0%
okay well i may i'm hopefully not
 
04:50:49.750 --> 04:50:49.760 align:start position:0%
skating on two thin ice here but the
 
04:50:52.470 --> 04:50:52.480 align:start position:0%
other issue is on lines in the bill page
 
04:50:55.110 --> 04:50:55.120 align:start position:0%
one lines 20 through 25 or so it talks
 
04:50:56.868 --> 04:50:56.878 align:start position:0%
about developing the practitioner
 
04:50:59.670 --> 04:50:59.680 align:start position:0%
patient relationship
 
04:51:02.070 --> 04:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
and it talks about the original statute
 
04:51:04.390 --> 04:51:04.400 align:start position:0%
talks about uh face-to-face two-way
 
04:51:07.510 --> 04:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
real-time so that does enable i'm sorry
 
04:51:09.430 --> 04:51:09.440 align:start position:0%
i'm mixing up slightly with 503 which
 
04:51:11.750 --> 04:51:11.760 align:start position:0%
had the face-to-face for the first visit
 
04:51:13.830 --> 04:51:13.840 align:start position:0%
my apology i just realized we have two
 
04:51:15.830 --> 04:51:15.840 align:start position:0%
telemedicine and i've spent an hour last
 
04:51:17.270 --> 04:51:17.280 align:start position:0%
night at about 11 o'clock trying to
 
04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
understand 503. so i was mixing that up
 
04:51:21.510 --> 04:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
slightly i think
 
04:51:24.070 --> 04:51:24.080 align:start position:0%
that is the major issue but it um it
 
04:51:26.830 --> 04:51:26.840 align:start position:0%
allows that asynchronous issue
 
04:51:29.270 --> 04:51:29.280 align:start position:0%
um and was there one other issue about
 
04:51:29.280 --> 04:51:30.550 align:start position:0%
um and was there one other issue about
this

04:51:30.550 --> 04:51:30.560 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:51:32.470 --> 04:51:32.480 align:start position:0%
no that's that's the problem
 
04:51:35.030 --> 04:51:35.040 align:start position:0%
practically speaking that's the
 
04:51:37.590 --> 04:51:37.600 align:start position:0%
expansion that this allows for
 
04:51:39.750 --> 04:51:39.760 align:start position:0%
that is my best understanding of the
 
04:51:43.670 --> 04:51:43.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:45.030 --> 04:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:51:46.470 --> 04:51:46.480 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
 
04:51:46.480 --> 04:51:49.190 align:start position:0%
any further questions for the
representative

04:51:49.190 --> 04:51:49.200 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:51:52.230 --> 04:51:52.240 align:start position:0%
 
04:51:55.430 --> 04:51:55.440 align:start position:0%
i'm just checking that i don't have
 
04:51:57.750 --> 04:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
yes yeah i think that is all that we can
 
04:51:59.430 --> 04:51:59.440 align:start position:0%
say that it actually does my apologies
 
04:52:04.628 --> 04:52:04.638 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:08.390 --> 04:52:08.400 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes kyle zebly and kyle
 
04:52:08.400 --> 04:52:13.270 align:start position:0%
chair recognizes kyle zebly and kyle
baker

04:52:13.270 --> 04:52:13.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:23.430 --> 04:52:23.440 align:start position:0%
 
04:52:25.270 --> 04:52:25.280 align:start position:0%
thank you so much uh chair vice chair
 
04:52:26.628 --> 04:52:26.638 align:start position:0%
and members of the committee it's real
 
04:52:28.230 --> 04:52:28.240 align:start position:0%
honor for me to be able to speak uh
 
04:52:30.868 --> 04:52:30.878 align:start position:0%
before you today my name is kyle zebly i
 
04:52:33.350 --> 04:52:33.360 align:start position:0%
am vice president of public policy for
 
04:52:34.948 --> 04:52:34.958 align:start position:0%
the american telemedicine association
 
04:52:37.590 --> 04:52:37.600 align:start position:0%
and i'm also executive director of ata
 
04:52:39.910 --> 04:52:39.920 align:start position:0%
action which is our affiliated trade and
 
04:52:42.470 --> 04:52:42.480 align:start position:0%
advocacy organization and here very much
 
04:52:46.310 --> 04:52:46.320 align:start position:0%
in very strong support of sp 390. we
 
04:52:48.070 --> 04:52:48.080 align:start position:0%
think it's a real commonsensical
 
04:52:51.270 --> 04:52:51.280 align:start position:0%
expansion of access to care for new
 
04:52:51.280 --> 04:52:52.470 align:start position:0%
expansion of access to care for new
hampshire

04:52:52.470 --> 04:52:52.480 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
04:52:54.628 --> 04:52:54.638 align:start position:0%
it would really make sure that new
 
04:52:55.990 --> 04:52:56.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is in line with many other
 
04:52:58.788 --> 04:52:58.798 align:start position:0%
states and pursuing a tech neutral
 
04:53:01.750 --> 04:53:01.760 align:start position:0%
approach in allowing for providers to
 
04:53:03.590 --> 04:53:03.600 align:start position:0%
make the determination for themselves
 
04:53:05.190 --> 04:53:05.200 align:start position:0%
and for their patients whether or not
 
04:53:08.070 --> 04:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
the standard of care can be met uh in in
 
04:53:10.070 --> 04:53:10.080 align:start position:0%
terms of interaction with the patient
 
04:53:12.390 --> 04:53:12.400 align:start position:0%
via the modality of their choice and in
 
04:53:15.270 --> 04:53:15.280 align:start position:0%
this instance of course asynchronously
 
04:53:17.510 --> 04:53:17.520 align:start position:0%
we think that obviously telehealth has
 
04:53:19.590 --> 04:53:19.600 align:start position:0%
been a game changer for
 
04:53:21.270 --> 04:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
citizens and patients across the country
 
04:53:23.590 --> 04:53:23.600 align:start position:0%
including in new hampshire and that this
 
04:53:26.628 --> 04:53:26.638 align:start position:0%
would really again bring new hampshire
 
04:53:28.708 --> 04:53:28.718 align:start position:0%
up to to speed where many other states
 
04:53:31.750 --> 04:53:31.760 align:start position:0%
are in allowing for these modalities to
 
04:53:32.948 --> 04:53:32.958 align:start position:0%
be utilized
 
04:53:34.550 --> 04:53:34.560 align:start position:0%
as had been noted previously in the
 
04:53:36.788 --> 04:53:36.798 align:start position:0%
answer to the representatives questions
 
04:53:39.670 --> 04:53:39.680 align:start position:0%
uh this is a pretty simple
 
04:53:39.680 --> 04:53:40.550 align:start position:0%
uh this is a pretty simple
uh

04:53:40.550 --> 04:53:40.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
04:53:42.708 --> 04:53:42.718 align:start position:0%
bill that would allow for asynchronous
 
04:53:44.550 --> 04:53:44.560 align:start position:0%
to be used as a modality and would also
 
04:53:45.990 --> 04:53:46.000 align:start position:0%
allow for a patient-provider
 
04:53:47.910 --> 04:53:47.920 align:start position:0%
relationship to be established
 
04:53:49.830 --> 04:53:49.840 align:start position:0%
asynchronously and i will say that's
 
04:53:52.550 --> 04:53:52.560 align:start position:0%
very much in keeping with best practices
 
04:53:54.230 --> 04:53:54.240 align:start position:0%
uh and certainly something that in
 
04:53:55.750 --> 04:53:55.760 align:start position:0%
addition to the american telemedicine
 
04:53:58.150 --> 04:53:58.160 align:start position:0%
association endorsing it's a concept
 
04:54:00.948 --> 04:54:00.958 align:start position:0%
that's endorsed by uh by the american
 
04:54:02.230 --> 04:54:02.240 align:start position:0%
medical association the federation of
 
04:54:04.230 --> 04:54:04.240 align:start position:0%
state medical boards and many other
 
04:54:05.830 --> 04:54:05.840 align:start position:0%
health care professional organizations
 
04:54:08.628 --> 04:54:08.638 align:start position:0%
so uh again very very supportive and
 
04:54:11.270 --> 04:54:11.280 align:start position:0%
happy to answer any questions that i can
 
04:54:13.670 --> 04:54:13.680 align:start position:0%
representative shapiro
 
04:54:15.750 --> 04:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and once again i'm
 
04:54:17.030 --> 04:54:17.040 align:start position:0%
not sure i'm
 
04:54:18.868 --> 04:54:18.878 align:start position:0%
i'm addressing this to the right person
 
04:54:21.350 --> 04:54:21.360 align:start position:0%
but in our earlier
 
04:54:22.868 --> 04:54:22.878 align:start position:0%
telehealth bill
 
04:54:25.190 --> 04:54:25.200 align:start position:0%
that followed on the emergency orders
 
04:54:27.430 --> 04:54:27.440 align:start position:0%
which i think was maybe a couple of
 
04:54:29.430 --> 04:54:29.440 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
04:54:31.670 --> 04:54:31.680 align:start position:0%
where there was a major expansion of
 
04:54:31.680 --> 04:54:33.110 align:start position:0%
where there was a major expansion of
telehealth

04:54:33.110 --> 04:54:33.120 align:start position:0%
telehealth
 
04:54:36.708 --> 04:54:36.718 align:start position:0%
it included parity with in-person
 
04:54:36.718 --> 04:54:39.190 align:start position:0%
it included parity with in-person
um

04:54:39.190 --> 04:54:39.200 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:41.670 --> 04:54:41.680 align:start position:0%
with in-person services
 
04:54:43.430 --> 04:54:43.440 align:start position:0%
so i don't know if there's really a
 
04:54:47.190 --> 04:54:47.200 align:start position:0%
parallel here with asynchronous
 
04:54:49.190 --> 04:54:49.200 align:start position:0%
with asynchronous
 
04:54:49.200 --> 04:54:51.510 align:start position:0%
with asynchronous
telehealth

04:54:51.510 --> 04:54:51.520 align:start position:0%
telehealth
 
04:54:53.110 --> 04:54:53.120 align:start position:0%
i don't know what the parallel would be
 
04:54:55.190 --> 04:54:55.200 align:start position:0%
to be doing that in the office
 
04:54:55.200 --> 04:54:57.190 align:start position:0%
to be doing that in the office
but

04:54:57.190 --> 04:54:57.200 align:start position:0%
but
 
04:55:00.470 --> 04:55:00.480 align:start position:0%
is it your idea that that that parity
 
04:55:02.788 --> 04:55:02.798 align:start position:0%
element which would be included for
 
04:55:05.430 --> 04:55:05.440 align:start position:0%
asynchronous services as well
 
04:55:06.628 --> 04:55:06.638 align:start position:0%
thank you so much for the question
 
04:55:08.868 --> 04:55:08.878 align:start position:0%
representative uh this bill does not
 
04:55:10.868 --> 04:55:10.878 align:start position:0%
affect uh the issues of the emergency
 
04:55:13.430 --> 04:55:13.440 align:start position:0%
orders and is not uh concerning issues
 
04:55:16.470 --> 04:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
of parity uh i believe uh that that is
 
04:55:18.628 --> 04:55:18.638 align:start position:0%
being studied now as to how the state's
 
04:55:20.150 --> 04:55:20.160 align:start position:0%
going to determine to cover those
 
04:55:22.708 --> 04:55:22.718 align:start position:0%
services moving forward both in terms of
 
04:55:24.708 --> 04:55:24.718 align:start position:0%
of insurance coverage and also insurance
 
04:55:26.628 --> 04:55:26.638 align:start position:0%
reimbursement but this bill is silent on
 
04:55:27.990 --> 04:55:28.000 align:start position:0%
that question does that answer your
 
04:55:29.510 --> 04:55:29.520 align:start position:0%
question sir
 
04:55:31.270 --> 04:55:31.280 align:start position:0%
follow up follow up
 
04:55:33.750 --> 04:55:33.760 align:start position:0%
well parity is already built into the
 
04:55:35.990 --> 04:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
statute for telehealth and
 
04:55:37.910 --> 04:55:37.920 align:start position:0%
in-person services but
 
04:55:40.948 --> 04:55:40.958 align:start position:0%
but this would not expand that part of
 
04:55:42.948 --> 04:55:42.958 align:start position:0%
what's already in statute that's correct
 
04:55:46.788 --> 04:55:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
04:55:48.150 --> 04:55:48.160 align:start position:0%

sort of how we worked through the senate

amendment process and got to the
 
04:56:15.990 --> 04:56:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
04:56:17.590 --> 04:56:17.600 align:start position:0%

04:56:51.760 --> 04:56:54.788 align:start position:0%
 
microphone

04:56:54.788 --> 04:56:54.798 align:start position:0%

short we are support in support of this
 
04:57:21.270 --> 04:57:21.280 align:start position:0%
bill for all the points made especially
 
04:57:23.270 --> 04:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
by representative kanerk and senator
 
04:57:23.280 --> 04:57:24.470 align:start position:0%
by representative kanerk and senator
avar

04:57:24.470 --> 04:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
avar
 
04:57:25.910 --> 04:57:25.920 align:start position:0%
in addition i'd like to add for the
 
04:57:27.830 --> 04:57:27.840 align:start position:0%
committee's consideration
 
04:57:30.390 --> 04:57:30.400 align:start position:0%
uh a few items that are of particular
 
04:57:31.750 --> 04:57:31.760 align:start position:0%
interest to the new hampshire department
 
04:57:33.190 --> 04:57:33.200 align:start position:0%
of corrections
 
04:57:36.470 --> 04:57:36.480 align:start position:0%
they are efficiency of services delivery
 
04:57:38.550 --> 04:57:38.560 align:start position:0%
of services i should say community
 
04:57:38.560 --> 04:57:40.390 align:start position:0%
of services i should say community
safety

04:57:40.390 --> 04:57:40.400 align:start position:0%
safety
 
04:57:43.510 --> 04:57:43.520 align:start position:0%
and also the
 
04:57:46.390 --> 04:57:46.400 align:start position:0%
delivery of services
 
04:57:49.910 --> 04:57:49.920 align:start position:0%
to residents or inmates as dictated by
 
04:57:51.430 --> 04:57:51.440 align:start position:0%
the eighth amendment of the united
 
04:57:54.150 --> 04:57:54.160 align:start position:0%
states constitution so
 
04:57:57.430 --> 04:57:57.440 align:start position:0%
telehealth allows us to
 
04:57:59.990 --> 04:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
reduce the number of medical runs which
 
04:58:02.470 --> 04:58:02.480 align:start position:0%
in our field means we don't have to take
 
04:58:04.788 --> 04:58:04.798 align:start position:0%
residents outside of facilities to go
 
04:58:06.868 --> 04:58:06.878 align:start position:0%
into community
 
04:58:09.190 --> 04:58:09.200 align:start position:0%
offices for treatment or assessment
 
04:58:13.030 --> 04:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
diagnosis etc so by allowing telehealth
 
04:58:15.590 --> 04:58:15.600 align:start position:0%
services to expand we would be able to
 
04:58:17.110 --> 04:58:17.120 align:start position:0%
use those more
 
04:58:19.110 --> 04:58:19.120 align:start position:0%
and we would be able to save money
 
04:58:20.550 --> 04:58:20.560 align:start position:0%
because we wouldn't be allocating as
 
04:58:23.030 --> 04:58:23.040 align:start position:0%
many resources to take people out we
 
04:58:25.030 --> 04:58:25.040 align:start position:0%
would be more efficient because the
 
04:58:26.788 --> 04:58:26.798 align:start position:0%
exchange of information becomes a little
 
04:58:28.868 --> 04:58:28.878 align:start position:0%
quicker when you're not waiting for
 
04:58:32.150 --> 04:58:32.160 align:start position:0%
reports etc etc and finally we would
 
04:58:34.390 --> 04:58:34.400 align:start position:0%
also be enhancing community safety
 
04:58:37.590 --> 04:58:37.600 align:start position:0%
because any time we take someone outside
 
04:58:40.470 --> 04:58:40.480 align:start position:0%
of a prison into the community you are
 
04:58:43.590 --> 04:58:43.600 align:start position:0%
increasing the chances of escape or
 
04:58:46.230 --> 04:58:46.240 align:start position:0%
other violent actions resulting in that
 
04:58:48.788 --> 04:58:48.798 align:start position:0%
community presence so we are very much
 
04:58:51.270 --> 04:58:51.280 align:start position:0%
in favor of this bill and
 
04:58:53.670 --> 04:58:53.680 align:start position:0%
respectfully requesting the committee to
 
04:58:55.510 --> 04:58:55.520 align:start position:0%
support it
 
04:58:57.990 --> 04:58:58.000 align:start position:0%
again i have submitted written testimony
 
04:59:00.070 --> 04:59:00.080 align:start position:0%
i can answer any questions now or you
 
04:59:02.230 --> 04:59:02.240 align:start position:0%
can reach me after the hearing if there
 
04:59:04.230 --> 04:59:04.240 align:start position:0%
is additional information i can provide
 
04:59:05.670 --> 04:59:05.680 align:start position:0%
again thank you so much for letting me
 
04:59:07.030 --> 04:59:07.040 align:start position:0%
speak today
 
04:59:10.150 --> 04:59:10.160 align:start position:0%
any questions
 
04:59:11.750 --> 04:59:11.760 align:start position:0%
representative leon
 
04:59:13.190 --> 04:59:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman and thank you for
 
04:59:15.670 --> 04:59:15.680 align:start position:0%
being here um i i'm looking at your
 
04:59:17.990 --> 04:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
testimony and you talk about expanded
 
04:59:19.990 --> 04:59:20.000 align:start position:0%
opportunities to partner with community
 
04:59:22.390 --> 04:59:22.400 align:start position:0%
practitioners for areas like medication
 
04:59:24.550 --> 04:59:24.560 align:start position:0%
assisted treatment does this bill do
 
04:59:26.070 --> 04:59:26.080 align:start position:0%
what you need to do or is it just part
 
04:59:28.390 --> 04:59:28.400 align:start position:0%
of the effort in order to get mat to
 
04:59:30.628 --> 04:59:30.638 align:start position:0%
these inmates it is just part of the
 
04:59:33.430 --> 04:59:33.440 align:start position:0%
effort we have a comp a robust i shall
 
04:59:36.230 --> 04:59:36.240 align:start position:0%
say robust mat program and we are
 
04:59:38.070 --> 04:59:38.080 align:start position:0%
looking at changing our model a bit to
 
04:59:42.948 --> 04:59:42.958 align:start position:0%
become also an moud program which is um
 
04:59:42.958 --> 04:59:44.310 align:start position:0%
become also an moud program which is um
allow

04:59:44.310 --> 04:59:44.320 align:start position:0%
allow
 
04:59:45.590 --> 04:59:45.600 align:start position:0%
this isn't the place for that but i'm
 
04:59:48.230 --> 04:59:48.240 align:start position:0%
happy to answer that later but um having
 
04:59:49.990 --> 04:59:50.000 align:start position:0%
mat allows us to access other
 
04:59:52.788 --> 04:59:52.798 align:start position:0%
consultants that not mat telehealth
 
04:59:54.948 --> 04:59:54.958 align:start position:0%
allow it would allow us to uh have
 
04:59:57.190 --> 04:59:57.200 align:start position:0%
access to other consultants and in
 
04:59:58.788 --> 04:59:58.798 align:start position:0%
different places if we should need them
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
for a particular patient thank you thank
 
05:00:03.670 --> 05:00:03.680 align:start position:0%

yes representative nutter upper my i
 
05:00:38.150 --> 05:00:38.160 align:start position:0%

05:00:40.310 --> 05:00:40.320 align:start position:0%
my phone oh thank you for allowing my
 
05:00:42.310 --> 05:00:42.320 align:start position:0%
question thank you for taking my
 
05:00:44.310 --> 05:00:44.320 align:start position:0%
question of course i've lost my manners
 
05:00:44.320 --> 05:00:45.190 align:start position:0%
question of course i've lost my manners
sometimes

05:00:45.190 --> 05:00:45.200 align:start position:0%
sometimes
 
05:00:47.270 --> 05:00:47.280 align:start position:0%
um i just want the answer
 
05:00:50.150 --> 05:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
moud what does that is medication for
 
05:00:52.708 --> 05:00:52.718 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorders of course okay
 
05:00:54.310 --> 05:00:54.320 align:start position:0%
perfect thank you thank you for asking
 
05:00:55.990 --> 05:00:56.000 align:start position:0%
and then you have
 
05:00:59.430 --> 05:00:59.440 align:start position:0%
private rooms within the
 
05:01:02.948 --> 05:01:02.958 align:start position:0%
facilities that the patient can
 
05:01:04.470 --> 05:01:04.480 align:start position:0%
telehealth with
 
05:01:07.110 --> 05:01:07.120 align:start position:0%
oh yes i mean can you describe that just
 
05:01:08.868 --> 05:01:08.878 align:start position:0%
for a second well it varies by facility
 
05:01:10.948 --> 05:01:10.958 align:start position:0%
because all of our facilities were built
 
05:01:12.310 --> 05:01:12.320 align:start position:0%
at different times with different
 
05:01:14.868 --> 05:01:14.878 align:start position:0%
designs but it's simply we would use an
 
05:01:17.590 --> 05:01:17.600 align:start position:0%
exam room in our health services center
 
05:01:19.510 --> 05:01:19.520 align:start position:0%
and in each of the prisons has a health
 
05:01:21.990 --> 05:01:22.000 align:start position:0%
services that's correct the prisons do
 
05:01:24.230 --> 05:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
and the secure psychiatric unit does and
 
05:01:26.708 --> 05:01:26.718 align:start position:0%
then for people at our transitional work
 
05:01:28.788 --> 05:01:28.798 align:start position:0%
center there's an office there or we
 
05:01:30.788 --> 05:01:30.798 align:start position:0%
would bring them back to the prison and
 
05:01:32.708 --> 05:01:32.718 align:start position:0%
find a room there to conduct this
 
05:01:34.470 --> 05:01:34.480 align:start position:0%
service okay thank you very much thank
 
05:01:34.480 --> 05:01:36.550 align:start position:0%

bill 390. now
 
05:05:14.948 --> 05:05:14.958 align:start position:0%
is there anything we haven't done that
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
i'm not aware of
 
05:05:18.310 --> 05:05:18.320 align:start position:0%
otherwise they'll be in a lot of trouble
 
05:05:20.948 --> 05:05:20.958 align:start position:0%
when we all come back next week
 
05:05:22.708 --> 05:05:22.718 align:start position:0%
no but i want to make a quick comment to
 
05:05:23.670 --> 05:05:23.680 align:start position:0%
the chair
 
05:05:25.270 --> 05:05:25.280 align:start position:0%
and to the committee
 
05:05:26.868 --> 05:05:26.878 align:start position:0%
when i looked at our
 
05:05:28.868 --> 05:05:28.878 align:start position:0%
list today every single one of them came
 
05:05:32.628 --> 05:05:32.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:34.310 --> 05:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
with i think
 
05:05:36.230 --> 05:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
all of them all of them all the ones on
 
05:05:38.390 --> 05:05:38.400 align:start position:0%
the hearing yes
 
05:05:40.628 --> 05:05:40.638 align:start position:0%
404 which was snap but that wasn't on
 
05:05:43.910 --> 05:05:43.920 align:start position:0%
our list but today ah
 
05:05:45.430 --> 05:05:45.440 align:start position:0%
yes representative
 
05:05:46.948 --> 05:05:46.958 align:start position:0%
yes we do have one other order of
 
05:05:48.550 --> 05:05:48.560 align:start position:0%
business though before you dismiss this
 
05:05:50.470 --> 05:05:50.480 align:start position:0%
and that is we have to give you some
 
05:05:54.390 --> 05:05:54.400 align:start position:0%
advice or advice and consent on hb 503
 
05:05:55.590 --> 05:05:55.600 align:start position:0%
that was
 
05:05:57.110 --> 05:05:57.120 align:start position:0%
one of the things you said we needed to
 
05:05:58.470 --> 05:05:58.480 align:start position:0%
talk about because we have to decide
 
05:06:01.190 --> 05:06:01.200 align:start position:0%
whether we wish to accede to the senate
 
05:06:02.150 --> 05:06:02.160 align:start position:0%
or not
 
05:06:03.990 --> 05:06:04.000 align:start position:0%
and i'd be glad to speak to that if you
 
05:06:05.990 --> 05:06:06.000 align:start position:0%
wish me to do so the chair has actually
 
05:06:08.150 --> 05:06:08.160 align:start position:0%
made an executive decision that we will
 
05:06:09.910 --> 05:06:09.920 align:start position:0%
be having a committee of conference i
 
05:06:11.830 --> 05:06:11.840 align:start position:0%
get to make that call
 
05:06:14.470 --> 05:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
i can be advised by people
 
05:06:14.480 --> 05:06:15.910 align:start position:0%
i can be advised by people
why

05:06:15.910 --> 05:06:15.920 align:start position:0%
why
 
05:06:15.920 --> 05:06:16.580 align:start position:0%
why
because

05:06:16.580 --> 05:06:16.590 align:start position:0%
because
 
05:06:16.590 --> 05:06:20.948 align:start position:0%
because
[Music]

05:06:20.948 --> 05:06:20.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:06:23.270 --> 05:06:23.280 align:start position:0%
it didn't look like it sufficiently
 
05:06:25.510 --> 05:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
matched what we did
 
05:06:28.150 --> 05:06:28.160 align:start position:0%
and he says backpedaling
 
05:06:31.670 --> 05:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
um i could be persuaded otherwise may i
 
05:06:34.070 --> 05:06:34.080 align:start position:0%
try you give it your best shot here's
 
05:06:35.990 --> 05:06:36.000 align:start position:0%
the scoop um you know this went over as
 
05:06:37.830 --> 05:06:37.840 align:start position:0%
a housing stability bill and they did
 
05:06:41.270 --> 05:06:41.280 align:start position:0%
make a few changes on the uh text of
 
05:06:43.510 --> 05:06:43.520 align:start position:0%
what we sent them which you know there
 
05:06:45.590 --> 05:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
was a there was a non-germane amendment
 
05:06:47.830 --> 05:06:47.840 align:start position:0%
which of course the senate is famous for
 
05:06:49.910 --> 05:06:49.920 align:start position:0%
there are a few things that they changed
 
05:06:51.910 --> 05:06:51.920 align:start position:0%
i mean they for example did some issues
 
05:06:52.868 --> 05:06:52.878 align:start position:0%
in the
 
05:06:55.590 --> 05:06:55.600 align:start position:0%
adding bureau of housing supports
 
05:06:56.948 --> 05:06:56.958 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
05:06:58.310 --> 05:06:58.320 align:start position:0%
to make it clear what department we're
 
05:07:00.470 --> 05:07:00.480 align:start position:0%
talking about those are pretty minor
 
05:07:03.190 --> 05:07:03.200 align:start position:0%
issues about who uh appoints the
 
05:07:04.708 --> 05:07:04.718 align:start position:0%
representatives of the philanthropic
 
05:07:06.708 --> 05:07:06.718 align:start position:0%
community and so on all those are pretty
 
05:07:08.550 --> 05:07:08.560 align:start position:0%
minor changes i think what got people a
 
05:07:09.830 --> 05:07:09.840 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
05:07:12.310 --> 05:07:12.320 align:start position:0%
uh give some heartburn to people was the
 
05:07:14.868 --> 05:07:14.878 align:start position:0%
massive change in the telehealth part
 
05:07:16.708 --> 05:07:16.718 align:start position:0%
that was a whole new section of the bill
 
05:07:18.470 --> 05:07:18.480 align:start position:0%
that was not part of the bill to begin
 
05:07:21.110 --> 05:07:21.120 align:start position:0%
with that was the non-german amendment
 
05:07:22.708 --> 05:07:22.718 align:start position:0%
as i said my eyes were crossing over to
 
05:07:24.150 --> 05:07:24.160 align:start position:0%
about 11 o'clock last night as i was
 
05:07:26.628 --> 05:07:26.638 align:start position:0%
trying to understand all this and to
 
05:07:28.708 --> 05:07:28.718 align:start position:0%
give some historical pictures for those
 
05:07:30.868 --> 05:07:30.878 align:start position:0%
who were not on this group a couple of
 
05:07:32.150 --> 05:07:32.160 align:start position:0%
years ago
 
05:07:36.550 --> 05:07:36.560 align:start position:0%
back in 2020 we passed 1623
 
05:07:39.510 --> 05:07:39.520 align:start position:0%
uh house bill 1623 now what that bill
 
05:07:41.510 --> 05:07:41.520 align:start position:0%
did actually let's just look at the big
 
05:07:43.590 --> 05:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
picture we have seen an expansion of
 
05:07:46.310 --> 05:07:46.320 align:start position:0%
telehealth which began before covet as
 
05:07:47.830 --> 05:07:47.840 align:start position:0%
we were beginning to realize things we
 
05:07:50.150 --> 05:07:50.160 align:start position:0%
could do that might make sense
 
05:07:51.830 --> 05:07:51.840 align:start position:0%
and starting with the work that jay khan
 
05:07:55.270 --> 05:07:55.280 align:start position:0%
did this bill 1623 was
 
05:07:57.670 --> 05:07:57.680 align:start position:0%
introduced by brett marsh
 
05:07:59.430 --> 05:07:59.440 align:start position:0%
and we were starting to expand things
 
05:08:00.948 --> 05:08:00.958 align:start position:0%
and of course again this was done in the
 
05:08:03.910 --> 05:08:03.920 align:start position:0%
2020 session it was uh before covet hit
 
05:08:06.628 --> 05:08:06.638 align:start position:0%
and then with covid we did a lot and we
 
05:08:08.550 --> 05:08:08.560 align:start position:0%
saw the benefit
 
05:08:11.990 --> 05:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
of working uh with telemedicine to any
 
05:08:13.910 --> 05:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
number of situations and we realized
 
05:08:16.948 --> 05:08:16.958 align:start position:0%
that those benefits persist so after the
 
05:08:18.390 --> 05:08:18.400 align:start position:0%
state of emergency we're still trying to
 
05:08:19.990 --> 05:08:20.000 align:start position:0%
kind of clean up and figure out how to
 
05:08:21.830 --> 05:08:21.840 align:start position:0%
make things work better what this
 
05:08:23.990 --> 05:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
particular bill was it came in with a
 
05:08:25.910 --> 05:08:25.920 align:start position:0%
rather narrow focus and has expanded a
 
05:08:25.920 --> 05:08:26.628 align:start position:0%
rather narrow focus and has expanded a
bit

05:08:26.628 --> 05:08:26.638 align:start position:0%
bit
 
05:08:28.230 --> 05:08:28.240 align:start position:0%
to allow
 
05:08:31.830 --> 05:08:31.840 align:start position:0%
the uh the um
 
05:08:33.590 --> 05:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
that there would not need to be a
 
05:08:33.600 --> 05:08:35.270 align:start position:0%
that there would not need to be a
face-to-face

05:08:35.270 --> 05:08:35.280 align:start position:0%
face-to-face
 
05:08:35.280 --> 05:08:36.310 align:start position:0%
face-to-face
uh

05:08:36.310 --> 05:08:36.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:08:38.788 --> 05:08:38.798 align:start position:0%
a service provided um
 
05:08:40.628 --> 05:08:40.638 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm not saying this well in
 
05:08:42.390 --> 05:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
certain key situations of being treated
 
05:08:44.150 --> 05:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
for opioid use disorder by
 
05:08:46.070 --> 05:08:46.080 align:start position:0%
medication-assisted treatment that you
 
05:08:47.590 --> 05:08:47.600 align:start position:0%
would not have to have a pre-existing
 
05:08:49.110 --> 05:08:49.120 align:start position:0%
face-to-face relationship with the
 
05:08:49.120 --> 05:08:50.150 align:start position:0%
face-to-face relationship with the
patient

05:08:50.150 --> 05:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
patient
 
05:08:52.070 --> 05:08:52.080 align:start position:0%
and the uh this was going to be through
 
05:08:53.430 --> 05:08:53.440 align:start position:0%
the va
 
05:08:54.948 --> 05:08:54.958 align:start position:0%
if you're in a correctional facility as
 
05:08:57.270 --> 05:08:57.280 align:start position:0%
we just heard from paula mattis if the
 
05:08:58.788 --> 05:08:58.798 align:start position:0%
patient is being treated in one of the
 
05:09:00.948 --> 05:09:00.958 align:start position:0%
doorways if they're in a mental health
 
05:09:03.190 --> 05:09:03.200 align:start position:0%
center or in a hospital those were the
 
05:09:05.830 --> 05:09:05.840 align:start position:0%
amended version of 1623
 
05:09:07.190 --> 05:09:07.200 align:start position:0%
set those as
 
05:09:08.948 --> 05:09:08.958 align:start position:0%
exceptions to needing a face to face
 
05:09:08.958 --> 05:09:09.910 align:start position:0%
exceptions to needing a face to face
before

05:09:09.910 --> 05:09:09.920 align:start position:0%
before
 
05:09:11.430 --> 05:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
and the reason for that is that people
 
05:09:13.510 --> 05:09:13.520 align:start position:0%
with opioid use disorder when they kind
 
05:09:15.190 --> 05:09:15.200 align:start position:0%
of realize that they need some help
 
05:09:17.110 --> 05:09:17.120 align:start position:0%
there's a narrow window
 
05:09:18.390 --> 05:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
if you talk about the doorway program
 
05:09:20.070 --> 05:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
there's a narrow window for them to jump
 
05:09:21.910 --> 05:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
in and get their help
 
05:09:23.590 --> 05:09:23.600 align:start position:0%
and they're these are some of our harm
 
05:09:26.470 --> 05:09:26.480 align:start position:0%
reduction work that we're working on now
 
05:09:28.788 --> 05:09:28.798 align:start position:0%
what was uh if you did see though it
 
05:09:31.590 --> 05:09:31.600 align:start position:0%
came from um jim monahan he sent an
 
05:09:34.070 --> 05:09:34.080 align:start position:0%
email and then he sent a mail a mailing
 
05:09:35.830 --> 05:09:35.840 align:start position:0%
hard copy to all of us so i think it
 
05:09:37.350 --> 05:09:37.360 align:start position:0%
arrived on the weekend or something like
 
05:09:37.360 --> 05:09:39.030 align:start position:0%
arrived on the weekend or something like
that

05:09:39.030 --> 05:09:39.040 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:09:40.470 --> 05:09:40.480 align:start position:0%
the issue is that we found that there
 
05:09:43.270 --> 05:09:43.280 align:start position:0%
was a massive increase in people having
 
05:09:46.390 --> 05:09:46.400 align:start position:0%
accessibility to uh medication-assisted
 
05:09:46.400 --> 05:09:47.910 align:start position:0%
accessibility to uh medication-assisted
treatment

05:09:47.910 --> 05:09:47.920 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:09:50.150 --> 05:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
with telehealth
 
05:09:50.160 --> 05:09:51.190 align:start position:0%
with telehealth
and

05:09:51.190 --> 05:09:51.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
05:09:53.590 --> 05:09:53.600 align:start position:0%
the idea was since that worked so well
 
05:09:55.670 --> 05:09:55.680 align:start position:0%
for people who were not
 
05:09:57.430 --> 05:09:57.440 align:start position:0%
in the hospital mental health setting
 
05:09:59.270 --> 05:09:59.280 align:start position:0%
correctional facility you know or the
 
05:10:01.270 --> 05:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
doorways program it worked well for
 
05:10:03.430 --> 05:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
people that are just in the community
 
05:10:04.788 --> 05:10:04.798 align:start position:0%
they could come in
 
05:10:04.798 --> 05:10:06.070 align:start position:0%
they could come in
access

05:10:06.070 --> 05:10:06.080 align:start position:0%
access
 
05:10:08.628 --> 05:10:08.638 align:start position:0%
uh in a very narrow window
 
05:10:11.910 --> 05:10:11.920 align:start position:0%
opioid use disorder management
 
05:10:14.230 --> 05:10:14.240 align:start position:0%
medication management and there there
 
05:10:16.150 --> 05:10:16.160 align:start position:0%
was a very nice
 
05:10:18.150 --> 05:10:18.160 align:start position:0%
couple of graphics that they sent
 
05:10:20.070 --> 05:10:20.080 align:start position:0%
regarding the time
 
05:10:22.390 --> 05:10:22.400 align:start position:0%
during covid often within less than an
 
05:10:24.788 --> 05:10:24.798 align:start position:0%
hour 77 of people were linked in for
 
05:10:24.798 --> 05:10:26.788 align:start position:0%
hour 77 of people were linked in for
treatment

05:10:26.788 --> 05:10:26.798 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:10:29.030 --> 05:10:29.040 align:start position:0%
pre-covered that was two percent
 
05:10:31.510 --> 05:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
postcode is still still only 12 because
 
05:10:33.430 --> 05:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
now we put up a barrier because they
 
05:10:35.670 --> 05:10:35.680 align:start position:0%
have to have this face to face
 
05:10:37.030 --> 05:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
by the time they're going to get into a
 
05:10:39.110 --> 05:10:39.120 align:start position:0%
face-to-face they may have changed their
 
05:10:39.120 --> 05:10:39.990 align:start position:0%
face-to-face they may have changed their
mind

05:10:39.990 --> 05:10:40.000 align:start position:0%
mind
 
05:10:41.190 --> 05:10:41.200 align:start position:0%
they may have decided they're not going
 
05:10:42.550 --> 05:10:42.560 align:start position:0%
to go ahead
 
05:10:42.560 --> 05:10:43.910 align:start position:0%
to go ahead
with

05:10:43.910 --> 05:10:43.920 align:start position:0%
with
 
05:10:45.350 --> 05:10:45.360 align:start position:0%
approaching medication-assisted
 
05:10:45.360 --> 05:10:46.470 align:start position:0%
approaching medication-assisted
treatment

05:10:46.470 --> 05:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
treatment
 
05:10:48.470 --> 05:10:48.480 align:start position:0%
so what this bill what they what the
 
05:10:51.270 --> 05:10:51.280 align:start position:0%
senate did was remove
 
05:10:52.948 --> 05:10:52.958 align:start position:0%
basically i view it as not something
 
05:10:55.270 --> 05:10:55.280 align:start position:0%
that's contradictory to 1623 but it's
 
05:10:56.948 --> 05:10:56.958 align:start position:0%
moving on
 
05:10:59.670 --> 05:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
from what 1623 started
 
05:11:01.190 --> 05:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
saying hey
 
05:11:03.110 --> 05:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
this really worked better we've learned
 
05:11:05.670 --> 05:11:05.680 align:start position:0%
a lesson so why don't we go ahead and
 
05:11:07.590 --> 05:11:07.600 align:start position:0%
just let this happen
 
05:11:08.868 --> 05:11:08.878 align:start position:0%
so what they're doing if you look in
 
05:11:10.868 --> 05:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
there on the side by side that christina
 
05:11:13.350 --> 05:11:13.360 align:start position:0%
dyer so nicely provided for us several
 
05:11:14.788 --> 05:11:14.798 align:start position:0%
pages in
 
05:11:17.110 --> 05:11:17.120 align:start position:0%
you'll see a lot of strikeouts
 
05:11:18.788 --> 05:11:18.798 align:start position:0%
and those strikeouts are all that those
 
05:11:20.150 --> 05:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
five things that representative marsh
 
05:11:22.948 --> 05:11:22.958 align:start position:0%
put in at that time back in 2020 of
 
05:11:25.190 --> 05:11:25.200 align:start position:0%
restricting it to being in the
 
05:11:28.230 --> 05:11:28.240 align:start position:0%
va a correctional facility doorway
 
05:11:30.788 --> 05:11:30.798 align:start position:0%
mental health facility or a hospital now
 
05:11:33.350 --> 05:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
it's just you can establish it
 
05:11:34.628 --> 05:11:34.638 align:start position:0%
and get going
 
05:11:36.788 --> 05:11:36.798 align:start position:0%
so it allows the patient to access
 
05:11:38.628 --> 05:11:38.638 align:start position:0%
medication and sit this their assisted
 
05:11:41.830 --> 05:11:41.840 align:start position:0%
therapy in a timely fashion it does it
 
05:11:43.510 --> 05:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
exempts methadone because that's a
 
05:11:44.708 --> 05:11:44.718 align:start position:0%
little bit more complex and it's a
 
05:11:47.190 --> 05:11:47.200 align:start position:0%
long-term treatment very well long-term
 
05:11:48.150 --> 05:11:48.160 align:start position:0%
and different
 
05:11:48.160 --> 05:11:49.030 align:start position:0%
and different
um

05:11:49.030 --> 05:11:49.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:11:50.788 --> 05:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
we're basically talking suboxone and
 
05:11:53.030 --> 05:11:53.040 align:start position:0%
those things such as well she's not here
 
05:11:54.788 --> 05:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
anymore but such as paul mattis i almost
 
05:11:55.990 --> 05:11:56.000 align:start position:0%
wish she were because it'd been fun to
 
05:11:57.430 --> 05:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
hear what she would say although she was
 
05:11:58.628 --> 05:11:58.638 align:start position:0%
already able to do this to the
 
05:12:01.670 --> 05:12:01.680 align:start position:0%
correctional facilities but this allows
 
05:12:03.430 --> 05:12:03.440 align:start position:0%
the general public who is not
 
05:12:05.510 --> 05:12:05.520 align:start position:0%
incarcerated or hospitalized or in a
 
05:12:05.520 --> 05:12:06.550 align:start position:0%
incarcerated or hospitalized or in a
doorways

05:12:06.550 --> 05:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
doorways
 
05:12:08.550 --> 05:12:08.560 align:start position:0%
to access medication assisted treatment
 
05:12:10.230 --> 05:12:10.240 align:start position:0%
in a timely fashion
 
05:12:12.150 --> 05:12:12.160 align:start position:0%
which is an enormously important harms
 
05:12:14.708 --> 05:12:14.718 align:start position:0%
reduction maneuver to prevent overdose
 
05:12:15.910 --> 05:12:15.920 align:start position:0%
and get people on the right road to
 
05:12:17.110 --> 05:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
recover because we start them on
 
05:12:18.628 --> 05:12:18.638 align:start position:0%
medication assisted treatment one of the
 
05:12:19.990 --> 05:12:20.000 align:start position:0%
goals is this is the idea of the
 
05:12:22.310 --> 05:12:22.320 align:start position:0%
doorways is also get them started to be
 
05:12:24.070 --> 05:12:24.080 align:start position:0%
treated on other aspects of mental
 
05:12:25.910 --> 05:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
health issues and so on that need to be
 
05:12:25.920 --> 05:12:26.948 align:start position:0%
health issues and so on that need to be
addressed

05:12:26.948 --> 05:12:26.958 align:start position:0%
addressed
 
05:12:28.708 --> 05:12:28.718 align:start position:0%
to help get them away from their
 
05:12:30.230 --> 05:12:30.240 align:start position:0%
substance abuse that they started to
 
05:12:32.310 --> 05:12:32.320 align:start position:0%
begin with
 
05:12:34.550 --> 05:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
so i view this that's why i'm looking
 
05:12:35.990 --> 05:12:36.000 align:start position:0%
this with a perspective and i've been
 
05:12:37.110 --> 05:12:37.120 align:start position:0%
here long enough not as long as
 
05:12:38.628 --> 05:12:38.638 align:start position:0%
representing mcmahon but i've been here
 
05:12:39.910 --> 05:12:39.920 align:start position:0%
long enough to have a little bit of that
 
05:12:41.590 --> 05:12:41.600 align:start position:0%
time perspective i just had to get that
 
05:12:44.390 --> 05:12:44.400 align:start position:0%
one in um of looking at how things have
 
05:12:46.070 --> 05:12:46.080 align:start position:0%
evolved over time
 
05:12:47.750 --> 05:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
as i said when i gave my testimony on
 
05:12:47.760 --> 05:12:49.190 align:start position:0%
as i said when i gave my testimony on
390

05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
390
 
05:12:50.470 --> 05:12:50.480 align:start position:0%
when i was in practice we didn't have
 
05:12:53.430 --> 05:12:53.440 align:start position:0%
telemedicine i finished i finished only
 
05:12:55.030 --> 05:12:55.040 align:start position:0%
seven years ago
 
05:12:58.310 --> 05:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
duh now it's become quite popular not
 
05:13:00.788 --> 05:13:00.798 align:start position:0%
just popular but effective and efficient
 
05:13:02.230 --> 05:13:02.240 align:start position:0%
and this is a way for us to make a
 
05:13:04.708 --> 05:13:04.718 align:start position:0%
difference in our opioid
 
05:13:06.150 --> 05:13:06.160 align:start position:0%
epidemic that we're still trying to
 
05:13:08.868 --> 05:13:08.878 align:start position:0%
treat we still have a lot of overdoses
 
05:13:10.868 --> 05:13:10.878 align:start position:0%
if we can get people in and get them
 
05:13:12.628 --> 05:13:12.638 align:start position:0%
treated we're going to do them a huge
 
05:13:12.638 --> 05:13:13.590 align:start position:0%
treated we're going to do them a huge
favor

05:13:13.590 --> 05:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
favor
 
05:13:13.600 --> 05:13:14.310 align:start position:0%
favor
so

05:13:14.310 --> 05:13:14.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:13:15.510 --> 05:13:15.520 align:start position:0%
i don't see any reason to have a
 
05:13:18.550 --> 05:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
committee of conference to disagree with
 
05:13:21.110 --> 05:13:21.120 align:start position:0%
with this because again though it looks
 
05:13:22.310 --> 05:13:22.320 align:start position:0%
really imposing when you have a
 
05:13:24.470 --> 05:13:24.480 align:start position:0%
multi-page side by side
 
05:13:26.230 --> 05:13:26.240 align:start position:0%
a lot of this because it had to modify
 
05:13:27.910 --> 05:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
the nurse practice act the physician
 
05:13:29.270 --> 05:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
practice act all that so it's all that
 
05:13:30.788 --> 05:13:30.798 align:start position:0%
redundant language like you frequently
 
05:13:31.990 --> 05:13:32.000 align:start position:0%
see when it has to do different
 
05:13:34.310 --> 05:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
providers but it's all the same language
 
05:13:36.470 --> 05:13:36.480 align:start position:0%
and i think it's a very positive step
 
05:13:38.390 --> 05:13:38.400 align:start position:0%
toward moving telehealth
 
05:13:41.910 --> 05:13:41.920 align:start position:0%
into the 21st century um
 
05:13:43.830 --> 05:13:43.840 align:start position:0%
so i i would favor just proceeding to
 
05:13:46.628 --> 05:13:46.638 align:start position:0%
the senate's position on this
 
05:13:50.470 --> 05:13:50.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:13:51.510 --> 05:13:51.520 align:start position:0%
while i
 
05:13:53.670 --> 05:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
while i completely agree with um
 
05:13:56.948 --> 05:13:56.958 align:start position:0%
representative canark's um
 
05:13:59.110 --> 05:13:59.120 align:start position:0%
view that we should
 
05:14:01.110 --> 05:14:01.120 align:start position:0%
enhance what we already have in terms of
 
05:14:06.070 --> 05:14:06.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:08.390 --> 05:14:08.400 align:start position:0%
expand this a little bit more to people
 
05:14:09.670 --> 05:14:09.680 align:start position:0%
in their homes who are not in
 
05:14:12.390 --> 05:14:12.400 align:start position:0%
institutions and and and by the way that
 
05:14:14.150 --> 05:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
also kind of aligns with the mobile
 
05:14:16.788 --> 05:14:16.798 align:start position:0%
crisis system that um this will be
 
05:14:19.030 --> 05:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
available for people
 
05:14:22.550 --> 05:14:22.560 align:start position:0%
um to be initiated during a crisis when
 
05:14:24.868 --> 05:14:24.878 align:start position:0%
mobile crisis teams go to people's homes
 
05:14:26.310 --> 05:14:26.320 align:start position:0%
i don't know how often that would happen
 
05:14:28.230 --> 05:14:28.240 align:start position:0%
but it would be in a line with that kind
 
05:14:30.948 --> 05:14:30.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:14:33.430 --> 05:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
even though i totally agree with him
 
05:14:35.430 --> 05:14:35.440 align:start position:0%
from our earlier conversation i'm a
 
05:14:38.150 --> 05:14:38.160 align:start position:0%
little confused about
 
05:14:38.160 --> 05:14:39.590 align:start position:0%
little confused about
which

05:14:39.590 --> 05:14:39.600 align:start position:0%
which
 
05:14:41.750 --> 05:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
amendment was added to which bill was it
 
05:14:44.628 --> 05:14:44.638 align:start position:0%
a telehealth bill first or was it a
 
05:14:47.350 --> 05:14:47.360 align:start position:0%
housing stability bill first and
 
05:14:49.430 --> 05:14:49.440 align:start position:0%
that seems to be the
 
05:14:51.750 --> 05:14:51.760 align:start position:0%
issue that the two of these got joined
 
05:14:53.910 --> 05:14:53.920 align:start position:0%
representative canarch it was a housing
 
05:14:56.390 --> 05:14:56.400 align:start position:0%
stability bill first i actually believe
 
05:14:58.550 --> 05:14:58.560 align:start position:0%
it or not was able to find it i was
 
05:15:00.070 --> 05:15:00.080 align:start position:0%
surprised that i was able to find this
 
05:15:01.750 --> 05:15:01.760 align:start position:0%
from last year and even more surprised
 
05:15:04.788 --> 05:15:04.798 align:start position:0%
what i found 1623 from two years ago but
 
05:15:07.030 --> 05:15:07.040 align:start position:0%
it we we were faced
 
05:15:08.868 --> 05:15:08.878 align:start position:0%
we all we did this one i think on zoom
 
05:15:10.948 --> 05:15:10.958 align:start position:0%
back you know last year
 
05:15:13.430 --> 05:15:13.440 align:start position:0%
with uh this bill it came in as a bill
 
05:15:14.830 --> 05:15:14.840 align:start position:0%
for the new hampshire commission on
 
05:15:16.868 --> 05:15:16.878 align:start position:0%
homelessness there were questions about
 
05:15:18.948 --> 05:15:18.958 align:start position:0%
it was it redundant with the council on
 
05:15:21.110 --> 05:15:21.120 align:start position:0%
housing stability that the governor had
 
05:15:23.030 --> 05:15:23.040 align:start position:0%
put in by administrative action what
 
05:15:24.868 --> 05:15:24.878 align:start position:0%
happened but it really wasn't because
 
05:15:26.310 --> 05:15:26.320 align:start position:0%
the housing stability had more to do
 
05:15:27.910 --> 05:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
with workforce housing this had more to
 
05:15:30.470 --> 05:15:30.480 align:start position:0%
do with homelessness it was a co
 
05:15:32.150 --> 05:15:32.160 align:start position:0%
this uh commission was a coalition of a
 
05:15:34.230 --> 05:15:34.240 align:start position:0%
number of different organizations to
 
05:15:36.788 --> 05:15:36.798 align:start position:0%
work on the issue of homelessness that
 
05:15:39.430 --> 05:15:39.440 align:start position:0%
was the original bill that is 503. the
 
05:15:41.990 --> 05:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
senate in their usual fashion of
 
05:15:44.788 --> 05:15:44.798 align:start position:0%
attaching non-jermaine amendments
 
05:15:46.708 --> 05:15:46.718 align:start position:0%
record you know basically people came to
 
05:15:48.470 --> 05:15:48.480 align:start position:0%
them saying we need to address this
 
05:15:50.788 --> 05:15:50.798 align:start position:0%
telehealth issue and of course it's
 
05:15:52.708 --> 05:15:52.718 align:start position:0%
after the bill filing time
 
05:15:54.708 --> 05:15:54.718 align:start position:0%
um when the
 
05:15:54.718 --> 05:15:55.990 align:start position:0%
um when the
emergency

05:15:55.990 --> 05:15:56.000 align:start position:0%
emergency
 
05:15:57.510 --> 05:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
you know declarations are over and stuff
 
05:15:59.510 --> 05:15:59.520 align:start position:0%
and they suddenly saw the spike in
 
05:16:02.070 --> 05:16:02.080 align:start position:0%
people not getting access and so they
 
05:16:04.788 --> 05:16:04.798 align:start position:0%
went to the senators i'm not sure who
 
05:16:06.948 --> 05:16:06.958 align:start position:0%
brought in for this amendment and asked
 
05:16:08.628 --> 05:16:08.638 align:start position:0%
them to place this in as a non-germain
 
05:16:08.638 --> 05:16:09.670 align:start position:0%
them to place this in as a non-germain
amendment

05:16:09.670 --> 05:16:09.680 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:16:11.350 --> 05:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
and it was placed as a non-german
 
05:16:13.270 --> 05:16:13.280 align:start position:0%
amendment so the homelessness was the
 
05:16:16.550 --> 05:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
original thrust this totally non-germane
 
05:16:18.310 --> 05:16:18.320 align:start position:0%
adds the telemedicine
 
05:16:18.320 --> 05:16:19.270 align:start position:0%
adds the telemedicine
uh

05:16:19.270 --> 05:16:19.280 align:start position:0%
uh
 
05:16:21.190 --> 05:16:21.200 align:start position:0%
face-to-face redefinition was it
 
05:16:21.200 --> 05:16:22.470 align:start position:0%
face-to-face redefinition was it
retained

05:16:22.470 --> 05:16:22.480 align:start position:0%
retained
 
05:16:23.830 --> 05:16:23.840 align:start position:0%
yes that's why it's that's why we're
 
05:16:25.910 --> 05:16:25.920 align:start position:0%
seeing it such a long way out it was the
 
05:16:27.510 --> 05:16:27.520 align:start position:0%
senate calls it a different thing they
 
05:16:30.150 --> 05:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
called it re-referred to committee
 
05:16:31.750 --> 05:16:31.760 align:start position:0%
that's how they handled it when it came
 
05:16:33.670 --> 05:16:33.680 align:start position:0%
to the floor in the senate because they
 
05:16:34.948 --> 05:16:34.958 align:start position:0%
wanted to look at it some more and they
 
05:16:36.070 --> 05:16:36.080 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of change some of the
 
05:16:36.080 --> 05:16:37.270 align:start position:0%
wanted to kind of change some of the
population

05:16:37.270 --> 05:16:37.280 align:start position:0%
population
 
05:16:41.110 --> 05:16:41.120 align:start position:0%
um then when it went into um
 
05:16:42.708 --> 05:16:42.718 align:start position:0%
when they worked out this year which i
 
05:16:44.150 --> 05:16:44.160 align:start position:0%
don't know why they waited to send this
 
05:16:45.750 --> 05:16:45.760 align:start position:0%
to us this late but they finally got
 
05:16:46.788 --> 05:16:46.798 align:start position:0%
around to
 
05:16:48.390 --> 05:16:48.400 align:start position:0%
working on it and putting their
 
05:16:50.788 --> 05:16:50.798 align:start position:0%
non-german amendment in and then we
 
05:16:56.868 --> 05:16:56.878 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:59.670 --> 05:16:59.680 align:start position:0%
thank you mr chairman um
 
05:17:02.628 --> 05:17:02.638 align:start position:0%
this non-german amendment
 
05:17:02.638 --> 05:17:04.150 align:start position:0%
this non-german amendment
is

05:17:04.150 --> 05:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:17:06.708 --> 05:17:06.718 align:start position:0%
i the only term i can use is
 
05:17:06.718 --> 05:17:09.670 align:start position:0%
i the only term i can use is
non-diplomatic

05:17:09.670 --> 05:17:09.680 align:start position:0%
non-diplomatic
 
05:17:09.680 --> 05:17:10.628 align:start position:0%
non-diplomatic
um

05:17:10.628 --> 05:17:10.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:17:12.150 --> 05:17:12.160 align:start position:0%
there's going to be a yiddish phrase for
 
05:17:15.910 --> 05:17:15.920 align:start position:0%
that no it is it is really certain
 
05:17:18.470 --> 05:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
saying to the spine surgeon
 
05:17:21.270 --> 05:17:21.280 align:start position:0%
doc while you're in there fusing my
 
05:17:24.390 --> 05:17:24.400 align:start position:0%
vertebrae can you fix my bunions
 
05:17:27.910 --> 05:17:27.920 align:start position:0%
we have no expertise on this committee
 
05:17:30.390 --> 05:17:30.400 align:start position:0%
on housing stability we shouldn't be
 
05:17:33.430 --> 05:17:33.440 align:start position:0%
asked to vote on it it's inappropriate
 
05:17:36.628 --> 05:17:36.638 align:start position:0%
for the senate to provide this non j and
 
05:17:40.150 --> 05:17:40.160 align:start position:0%
actually as representative knurk has
 
05:17:42.708 --> 05:17:42.718 align:start position:0%
given us the history of it the darndest
 
05:17:44.310 --> 05:17:44.320 align:start position:0%
part i would have said damnedest but i
 
05:17:46.948 --> 05:17:46.958 align:start position:0%
know i'm in good company the darndest
 
05:17:49.190 --> 05:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
part of it is that we
 
05:17:51.190 --> 05:17:51.200 align:start position:0%
are the non-germane amendment because it
 
05:17:53.910 --> 05:17:53.920 align:start position:0%
was originally a housing stability bill
 
05:17:55.510 --> 05:17:55.520 align:start position:0%
this is
 
05:17:58.550 --> 05:17:58.560 align:start position:0%
there is the yiddish word i can't use it
 
05:18:02.070 --> 05:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:04.550 --> 05:18:04.560 align:start position:0%
may i respond to that please yeah but
 
05:18:06.628 --> 05:18:06.638 align:start position:0%
well actually with all due respect
 
05:18:08.628 --> 05:18:08.638 align:start position:0%
it was initially
 
05:18:10.948 --> 05:18:10.958 align:start position:0%
a commission on homeless it did come to
 
05:18:12.628 --> 05:18:12.638 align:start position:0%
our committee we passed it out of our
 
05:18:15.430 --> 05:18:15.440 align:start position:0%
committee 19 to 2.
 
05:18:18.310 --> 05:18:18.320 align:start position:0%
um and when i was referring to 1623 that
 
05:18:20.070 --> 05:18:20.080 align:start position:0%
was giving you an historical perspective
 
05:18:22.390 --> 05:18:22.400 align:start position:0%
of the telemedicine piece but the bill
 
05:18:25.910 --> 05:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
itself the base bill was a bill we heard
 
05:18:29.030 --> 05:18:29.040 align:start position:0%
and worked on in the 2021 session we
 
05:18:30.390 --> 05:18:30.400 align:start position:0%
sent it out of our committee ought to
 
05:18:33.270 --> 05:18:33.280 align:start position:0%
pass with an amendment 19 to 2 but then
 
05:18:35.030 --> 05:18:35.040 align:start position:0%
went through the house i don't remember
 
05:18:39.270 --> 05:18:39.280 align:start position:0%
 
05:18:40.868 --> 05:18:40.878 align:start position:0%
it passed well whatever it doesn't
 
05:18:42.628 --> 05:18:42.638 align:start position:0%
matter and then it went to the senate
 
05:18:44.948 --> 05:18:44.958 align:start position:0%
the non-german part is the telemedicine
 
05:18:46.550 --> 05:18:46.560 align:start position:0%
again as i say i think
 
05:18:48.550 --> 05:18:48.560 align:start position:0%
although i was not privy to this at the
 
05:18:48.560 --> 05:18:49.750 align:start position:0%
although i was not privy to this at the
time

05:18:49.750 --> 05:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
time
 
05:18:51.350 --> 05:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
the i think what probably happened is
 
05:18:54.628 --> 05:18:54.638 align:start position:0%
they saw the explosion of poor access
 
05:18:56.070 --> 05:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
and then they went to among the senators
 
05:18:57.670 --> 05:18:57.680 align:start position:0%
and said could you stick it on a bill
 
05:18:59.430 --> 05:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
which they do all the time you know
 
05:19:01.510 --> 05:19:01.520 align:start position:0%
we've got a reputation for being such a
 
05:19:03.510 --> 05:19:03.520 align:start position:0%
darn good committee that's why everybody
 
05:19:05.430 --> 05:19:05.440 align:start position:0%
wants to send things to us now we got to
 
05:19:06.948 --> 05:19:06.958 align:start position:0%
do worse next time
 
05:19:08.788 --> 05:19:08.798 align:start position:0%
so i mean they're really it really is
 
05:19:11.270 --> 05:19:11.280 align:start position:0%
totally separate but they have not
 
05:19:12.310 --> 05:19:12.320 align:start position:0%
they really haven't changed the
 
05:19:13.830 --> 05:19:13.840 align:start position:0%
commission on homelessness very much
 
05:19:15.190 --> 05:19:15.200 align:start position:0%
that's still there in the first portion
 
05:19:16.708 --> 05:19:16.718 align:start position:0%
of the bill but what they've done is
 
05:19:18.470 --> 05:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
they've added all this other stuff and
 
05:19:19.830 --> 05:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
it is a pain in the butt for us to have
 
05:19:22.628 --> 05:19:22.638 align:start position:0%
to deal with it but it is what we get
 
05:19:24.230 --> 05:19:24.240 align:start position:0%
when the senate sends non-jermaine
 
05:19:26.830 --> 05:19:26.840 align:start position:0%
amendments back to us
 
05:19:31.350 --> 05:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:32.708 --> 05:19:32.718 align:start position:0%
he did it
 
05:19:34.708 --> 05:19:34.718 align:start position:0%
i did it without my teammate did you use
 
05:19:34.718 --> 05:19:37.030 align:start position:0%
i did it without my teammate did you use
that

05:19:37.030 --> 05:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:39.750 --> 05:19:39.760 align:start position:0%
could i request that uh
 
05:19:41.830 --> 05:19:41.840 align:start position:0%
jim monahan from the duplog group come
 
05:19:43.910 --> 05:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
up i asked him a question about this
 
05:19:46.390 --> 05:19:46.400 align:start position:0%
before he had a very good explanation so
 
05:19:48.708 --> 05:19:48.718 align:start position:0%
if we could let him explain why about
 
05:19:50.550 --> 05:19:50.560 align:start position:0%
the issue of germaine versus
 
05:19:50.560 --> 05:19:53.990 align:start position:0%
the issue of germaine versus
non-germaine

05:19:53.990 --> 05:19:54.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:19:55.670 --> 05:19:55.680 align:start position:0%
sure okay thank you very much and i
 
05:19:57.190 --> 05:19:57.200 align:start position:0%
appreciate you all taking a hard look at
 
05:19:59.190 --> 05:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
this this afternoon um representative
 
05:20:01.430 --> 05:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
kenick really summarized it uh very well
 
05:20:02.788 --> 05:20:02.798 align:start position:0%
but um
 
05:20:04.948 --> 05:20:04.958 align:start position:0%
uh as the data you can see that was
 
05:20:07.350 --> 05:20:07.360 align:start position:0%
included in the packet um after the
 
05:20:09.190 --> 05:20:09.200 align:start position:0%
emergency order was lifted it really
 
05:20:10.868 --> 05:20:10.878 align:start position:0%
jumped off the page that people were
 
05:20:12.150 --> 05:20:12.160 align:start position:0%
following or not being able to get
 
05:20:13.750 --> 05:20:13.760 align:start position:0%
access to care
 
05:20:16.150 --> 05:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
we worked with a department initially to
 
05:20:17.670 --> 05:20:17.680 align:start position:0%
see if we could resolve it through
 
05:20:20.550 --> 05:20:20.560 align:start position:0%
administrative rules this was in october
 
05:20:21.990 --> 05:20:22.000 align:start position:0%
and weren't able to do it so we did
 
05:20:23.590 --> 05:20:23.600 align:start position:0%
approach the senate
 
05:20:25.030 --> 05:20:25.040 align:start position:0%
um and in their defense i wouldn't say
 
05:20:27.590 --> 05:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
they stuck it on it we thought we they
 
05:20:29.430 --> 05:20:29.440 align:start position:0%
we actually uh went through the same
 
05:20:31.030 --> 05:20:31.040 align:start position:0%
process that the house would have
 
05:20:33.590 --> 05:20:33.600 align:start position:0%
required uh the bill was it and the
 
05:20:34.948 --> 05:20:34.958 align:start position:0%
senate health and human services
 
05:20:38.628 --> 05:20:38.638 align:start position:0%
committee had been referred uh we had a
 
05:20:40.948 --> 05:20:40.958 align:start position:0%
publicly noticed public hearing
 
05:20:42.230 --> 05:20:42.240 align:start position:0%
we arranged for people to come in and
 
05:20:44.548 --> 05:20:44.558 align:start position:0%
testify on it we
 
05:20:48.548 --> 05:20:48.558 align:start position:0%
got the support of dr ballad
 
05:20:50.310 --> 05:20:50.320 align:start position:0%
the medical director of state
 
05:20:52.470 --> 05:20:52.480 align:start position:0%
department of health and human services
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
and the addiction community felt that
 
05:20:55.910 --> 05:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
something needed to be done
 
05:20:58.470 --> 05:20:58.480 align:start position:0%
it was after the deadline so we weren't
 
05:21:00.548 --> 05:21:00.558 align:start position:0%
able to file it as a normal piece of
 
05:21:02.548 --> 05:21:02.558 align:start position:0%
legislation and frankly hope that it
 
05:21:04.230 --> 05:21:04.240 align:start position:0%
would move along a little quicker
 
05:21:06.150 --> 05:21:06.160 align:start position:0%
actually the senate acted on the bill in
 
05:21:06.160 --> 05:21:07.510 align:start position:0%
actually the senate acted on the bill in
january

05:21:07.510 --> 05:21:07.520 align:start position:0%
january
 
05:21:08.948 --> 05:21:08.958 align:start position:0%
um and
 
05:21:11.190 --> 05:21:11.200 align:start position:0%
i don't know why it took so long to to
 
05:21:13.430 --> 05:21:13.440 align:start position:0%
for the the clerk or the speaker to kind
 
05:21:14.868 --> 05:21:14.878 align:start position:0%
of push the health and human services
 
05:21:16.470 --> 05:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
but you also i also know you had a lot
 
05:21:18.150 --> 05:21:18.160 align:start position:0%
of work with all your house bills and
 
05:21:20.470 --> 05:21:20.480 align:start position:0%
all your senate bills and so that's why
 
05:21:23.030 --> 05:21:23.040 align:start position:0%
it would appear to be uh toward uh the
 
05:21:24.708 --> 05:21:24.718 align:start position:0%
last minute but i did want to make sure
 
05:21:28.548 --> 05:21:28.558 align:start position:0%
that the committee was aware that uh uh
 
05:21:30.788 --> 05:21:30.798 align:start position:0%
well first of all blame me
 
05:21:33.110 --> 05:21:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh for for the process but we did make
 
05:21:34.788 --> 05:21:34.798 align:start position:0%
sure that we had a public hearing on it
 
05:21:37.110 --> 05:21:37.120 align:start position:0%
and gain uh support for it and in the
 
05:21:39.030 --> 05:21:39.040 align:start position:0%
process of that we also did a
 
05:21:41.590 --> 05:21:41.600 align:start position:0%
presentation uh to the
 
05:21:43.990 --> 05:21:44.000 align:start position:0%
telecommunication the telehealth
 
05:21:46.230 --> 05:21:46.240 align:start position:0%
oversight committee uh and they sent a
 
05:21:47.830 --> 05:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
letter to the senate endorsing the
 
05:21:47.840 --> 05:21:49.030 align:start position:0%
letter to the senate endorsing the
amendment

05:21:49.030 --> 05:21:49.040 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
05:21:50.470 --> 05:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
if you were me
 
05:21:51.990 --> 05:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
and if that took place you'd take a
 
05:21:54.150 --> 05:21:54.160 align:start position:0%
whole horrific pay cut
 
05:21:54.160 --> 05:21:55.830 align:start position:0%
whole horrific pay cut
um

05:21:55.830 --> 05:21:55.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:21:58.548 --> 05:21:58.558 align:start position:0%
you would concur with the senate's
 
05:22:00.708 --> 05:22:00.718 align:start position:0%
version of this
 
05:22:02.708 --> 05:22:02.718 align:start position:0%
yes i would and i and that was the
 
05:22:03.910 --> 05:22:03.920 align:start position:0%
reason that i've been bearing you in
 
05:22:05.510 --> 05:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
mail and emails about that
 
05:22:07.830 --> 05:22:07.840 align:start position:0%
uh is to seek a concurrence i think it
 
05:22:09.830 --> 05:22:09.840 align:start position:0%
at least i don't want to be unfair to
 
05:22:11.350 --> 05:22:11.360 align:start position:0%
the committee but we did our best to
 
05:22:13.110 --> 05:22:13.120 align:start position:0%
make sure that there was consensus in
 
05:22:13.120 --> 05:22:13.830 align:start position:0%
make sure that there was consensus in
the

05:22:13.830 --> 05:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
the
 
05:22:16.070 --> 05:22:16.080 align:start position:0%
uh in at the department health and human
 
05:22:18.390 --> 05:22:18.400 align:start position:0%
services the telehealth uh
 
05:22:20.948 --> 05:22:20.958 align:start position:0%
medical society all the bases we touched
 
05:22:23.590 --> 05:22:23.600 align:start position:0%
all the bases but we haven't got
 
05:22:25.110 --> 05:22:25.120 align:start position:0%
to home plate yet and i guess that's
 
05:22:25.120 --> 05:22:28.708 align:start position:0%
to home plate yet and i guess that's
here

05:22:28.708 --> 05:22:28.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:30.628 --> 05:22:30.638 align:start position:0%
representative canark yeah just a quick
 
05:22:32.070 --> 05:22:32.080 align:start position:0%
thing just for everybody the hearing i
 
05:22:33.430 --> 05:22:33.440 align:start position:0%
just hadn't dug it up quickly enough the
 
05:22:34.868 --> 05:22:34.878 align:start position:0%
hearing in the senate was on october
 
05:22:37.270 --> 05:22:37.280 align:start position:0%
26th after the bill filing time uh by
 
05:22:39.510 --> 05:22:39.520 align:start position:0%
the time they did it they did pass it
 
05:22:41.030 --> 05:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
out uh
 
05:22:44.150 --> 05:22:44.160 align:start position:0%
at a voice vote on january 5. again i
 
05:22:46.470 --> 05:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
have no idea of why the senate
 
05:22:48.310 --> 05:22:48.320 align:start position:0%
sat on it or who sat on it for all that
 
05:22:51.430 --> 05:22:51.440 align:start position:0%
time but in any case um they were quite
 
05:22:53.430 --> 05:22:53.440 align:start position:0%
satisfied with it and i think that we
 
05:22:55.990 --> 05:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
should be comfortable with it
 
05:22:57.510 --> 05:22:57.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i think the docket if you have it
 
05:22:59.590 --> 05:22:59.600 align:start position:0%
there representative conrad it's it's
 
05:23:02.150 --> 05:23:02.160 align:start position:0%
it's still the last entry is senate you
 
05:23:03.270 --> 05:23:03.280 align:start position:0%
know so
 
05:23:03.280 --> 05:23:05.190 align:start position:0%
know so
um

05:23:05.190 --> 05:23:05.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:23:09.270 --> 05:23:09.280 align:start position:0%
you do you do realize that if um
 
05:23:12.230 --> 05:23:12.240 align:start position:0%
i admit you probably convinced me then i
 
05:23:14.788 --> 05:23:14.798 align:start position:0%
will have to fire representatives acton
 
05:23:16.788 --> 05:23:16.798 align:start position:0%
mcmahon woods and shapiro from a
 
05:23:18.948 --> 05:23:18.958 align:start position:0%
committee of conference
 
05:23:20.788 --> 05:23:20.798 align:start position:0%
they may not want that they'll probably
 
05:23:21.910 --> 05:23:21.920 align:start position:0%
be happy
 
05:23:25.990 --> 05:23:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:28.310 --> 05:23:28.320 align:start position:0%
okay anybody else on this obviously i
 
05:23:29.830 --> 05:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
didn't do my homework on it i didn't
 
05:23:32.150 --> 05:23:32.160 align:start position:0%
want to but thank you that you did as i
 
05:23:33.910 --> 05:23:33.920 align:start position:0%
said i i started working on it before
 
05:23:35.110 --> 05:23:35.120 align:start position:0%
and then i realized last night
 
05:23:37.030 --> 05:23:37.040 align:start position:0%
particularly with lucy not here
 
05:23:39.030 --> 05:23:39.040 align:start position:0%
that somebody needed to really do all
 
05:23:41.270 --> 05:23:41.280 align:start position:0%
this work and so i was up until forever
 
05:23:42.470 --> 05:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
last night
 
05:23:43.750 --> 05:23:43.760 align:start position:0%
looking at this till my eyes were
 
05:23:45.510 --> 05:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
crossed but i think i finally made sense
 
05:23:47.590 --> 05:23:47.600 align:start position:0%
out of it so
 
05:23:49.670 --> 05:23:49.680 align:start position:0%
okay this is helpful i'll walk over to
 
05:23:54.708 --> 05:23:54.718 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:56.470 --> 05:23:56.480 align:start position:0%
i i don't have any
 
05:23:58.708 --> 05:23:58.718 align:start position:0%
problems signing off on the telehealth
 
05:24:01.190 --> 05:24:01.200 align:start position:0%
part that we're we're adding i just have
 
05:24:04.070 --> 05:24:04.080 align:start position:0%
no idea what we're adding with the other
 
05:24:06.788 --> 05:24:06.798 align:start position:0%
part um is that
 
05:24:08.470 --> 05:24:08.480 align:start position:0%
is that um
 
05:24:10.150 --> 05:24:10.160 align:start position:0%
something that we've approved in the
 
05:24:12.310 --> 05:24:12.320 align:start position:0%
past or is it something is it the same
 
05:24:13.830 --> 05:24:13.840 align:start position:0%
thing we approved in the past is it
 
05:24:16.070 --> 05:24:16.080 align:start position:0%
something we want to approve of now yes
 
05:24:16.080 --> 05:24:18.150 align:start position:0%
something we want to approve of now yes
um

05:24:18.150 --> 05:24:18.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:24:20.868 --> 05:24:20.878 align:start position:0%
yeah we we as i said we passed this bill
 
05:24:22.310 --> 05:24:22.320 align:start position:0%
it was hard it's hard to remember
 
05:24:23.830 --> 05:24:23.840 align:start position:0%
because it was last year and there's but
 
05:24:25.350 --> 05:24:25.360 align:start position:0%
that's unchanged
 
05:24:26.868 --> 05:24:26.878 align:start position:0%
nearly that's that's right let me go
 
05:24:28.230 --> 05:24:28.240 align:start position:0%
over a couple of the changes if you pull
 
05:24:30.708 --> 05:24:30.718 align:start position:0%
out the side by side uh which is
 
05:24:32.628 --> 05:24:32.638 align:start position:0%
extremely helpful on this
 
05:24:35.350 --> 05:24:35.360 align:start position:0%
um and we look at the membership
 
05:24:37.590 --> 05:24:37.600 align:start position:0%
it talks about how many vacancies will
 
05:24:38.868 --> 05:24:38.878 align:start position:0%
be handled
 
05:24:41.350 --> 05:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
the changes were trivial for example two
 
05:24:43.110 --> 05:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
individuals one who would be a young
 
05:24:45.190 --> 05:24:45.200 align:start position:0%
adult with recent experience housing and
 
05:24:47.510 --> 05:24:47.520 align:start position:0%
stability the changes quote okama
 
05:24:49.190 --> 05:24:49.200 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor
 
05:24:51.350 --> 05:24:51.360 align:start position:0%
because it was left out by us as to who
 
05:24:53.030 --> 05:24:53.040 align:start position:0%
made that appointment and normally it's
 
05:24:55.270 --> 05:24:55.280 align:start position:0%
nice to know who makes the appointment
 
05:24:56.470 --> 05:24:56.480 align:start position:0%
if we look in the bureau chief of
 
05:24:57.990 --> 05:24:58.000 align:start position:0%
housing supports and behavioral health
 
05:24:58.000 --> 05:24:59.030 align:start position:0%
housing supports and behavioral health
supports

05:24:59.030 --> 05:24:59.040 align:start position:0%
supports
 
05:25:01.350 --> 05:25:01.360 align:start position:0%
and children of youth and families it
 
05:25:03.270 --> 05:25:03.280 align:start position:0%
adds comma department of health and
 
05:25:05.430 --> 05:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
human services and that identifies who's
 
05:25:06.470 --> 05:25:06.480 align:start position:0%
going to make
 
05:25:07.990 --> 05:25:08.000 align:start position:0%
the appointment
 
05:25:10.070 --> 05:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
and then there's
 
05:25:11.830 --> 05:25:11.840 align:start position:0%
two representatives of local providers
 
05:25:13.910 --> 05:25:13.920 align:start position:0%
of housing services
 
05:25:16.708 --> 05:25:16.718 align:start position:0%
comma appointed by the governor
 
05:25:18.310 --> 05:25:18.320 align:start position:0%
that's not exactly a big substantive
 
05:25:20.548 --> 05:25:20.558 align:start position:0%
change and then there's one new thing a
 
05:25:22.150 --> 05:25:22.160 align:start position:0%
representative of regional planning
 
05:25:24.548 --> 05:25:24.558 align:start position:0%
council appointed by the council
 
05:25:26.310 --> 05:25:26.320 align:start position:0%
that's perfectly reasonable we all have
 
05:25:27.750 --> 05:25:27.760 align:start position:0%
regional planning councils and they help
 
05:25:29.990 --> 05:25:30.000 align:start position:0%
to figure out these issues like for my
 
05:25:32.150 --> 05:25:32.160 align:start position:0%
areas lakes regional planning council
 
05:25:32.948 --> 05:25:32.958 align:start position:0%
and then if you look in the
 
05:25:34.548 --> 05:25:34.558 align:start position:0%
philanthropic community in the business
 
05:25:36.230 --> 05:25:36.240 align:start position:0%
community both those are a comma
 
05:25:37.830 --> 05:25:37.840 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor that's all
 
05:25:39.030 --> 05:25:39.040 align:start position:0%
that's added
 
05:25:40.628 --> 05:25:40.638 align:start position:0%
and then for law enforcement it makes it
 
05:25:42.150 --> 05:25:42.160 align:start position:0%
clear if you get represented for law
 
05:25:44.230 --> 05:25:44.240 align:start position:0%
enforcement who's going to do it
 
05:25:45.830 --> 05:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
comma appointed by the new hampshire
 
05:25:48.470 --> 05:25:48.480 align:start position:0%
chiefs of police association
 
05:25:50.150 --> 05:25:50.160 align:start position:0%
and then nami
 
05:25:51.270 --> 05:25:51.280 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
05:25:53.510 --> 05:25:53.520 align:start position:0%
put in i think nami was not there but
 
05:25:55.270 --> 05:25:55.280 align:start position:0%
now they're added because after all many
 
05:25:56.548 --> 05:25:56.558 align:start position:0%
people with housing problems have mental
 
05:25:58.230 --> 05:25:58.240 align:start position:0%
health problems and there's only one
 
05:25:59.670 --> 05:25:59.680 align:start position:0%
other thing they added in the charge
 
05:26:01.990 --> 05:26:02.000 align:start position:0%
develop a comprehensive state plan on
 
05:26:02.000 --> 05:26:03.270 align:start position:0%
develop a comprehensive state plan on
homelessness

05:26:03.270 --> 05:26:03.280 align:start position:0%
homelessness
 
05:26:03.280 --> 05:26:04.310 align:start position:0%
homelessness
um

05:26:04.310 --> 05:26:04.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:26:05.750 --> 05:26:05.760 align:start position:0%
then it has some issues about you know
 
05:26:06.868 --> 05:26:06.878 align:start position:0%
who calls the meeting and when the
 
05:26:09.750 --> 05:26:09.760 align:start position:0%
reports are due and that's it so it is
 
05:26:11.990 --> 05:26:12.000 align:start position:0%
fundamentally precisely the bill that we
 
05:26:15.110 --> 05:26:15.120 align:start position:0%
passed out of this committee 19 to 2
 
05:26:17.830 --> 05:26:17.840 align:start position:0%
back in the
 
05:26:21.590 --> 05:26:21.600 align:start position:0%
spring of 2021
 
05:26:23.750 --> 05:26:23.760 align:start position:0%
and here's the bill except for this
 
05:26:25.910 --> 05:26:25.920 align:start position:0%
these few changes identifying who's
 
05:26:27.190 --> 05:26:27.200 align:start position:0%
going to make the appointments and that
 
05:26:29.830 --> 05:26:29.840 align:start position:0%
kind of stuff so it is a let's get the
 
05:26:32.628 --> 05:26:32.638 align:start position:0%
phrase right here a minor cleaning up of
 
05:26:34.628 --> 05:26:34.638 align:start position:0%
things a housekeeping bill is the chair
 
05:26:37.270 --> 05:26:37.280 align:start position:0%
may call it but no
 
05:26:39.030 --> 05:26:39.040 align:start position:0%
no seriously they just clarified because
 
05:26:41.030 --> 05:26:41.040 align:start position:0%
we left it undefined as to who makes the
 
05:26:43.430 --> 05:26:43.440 align:start position:0%
appointments and normally in commissions
 
05:26:46.310 --> 05:26:46.320 align:start position:0%
you define who makes the appointment
 
05:26:46.320 --> 05:26:47.190 align:start position:0%
you define who makes the appointment
so

05:26:47.190 --> 05:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
05:26:49.430 --> 05:26:49.440 align:start position:0%
it is something we have seen it is
 
05:26:53.830 --> 05:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
something we took a position on 19 to 2.
 
05:26:53.840 --> 05:26:54.628 align:start position:0%
something we took a position on 19 to 2.
yeah

05:26:54.628 --> 05:26:54.638 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
05:26:57.030 --> 05:26:57.040 align:start position:0%
i you know sorry as i said it took me a
 
05:26:58.548 --> 05:26:58.558 align:start position:0%
long time last night of finding all the
 
05:26:59.670 --> 05:26:59.680 align:start position:0%
stuff and getting it organized to be
 
05:27:01.190 --> 05:27:01.200 align:start position:0%
able to figure out what the heck went on
 
05:27:03.110 --> 05:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
all right as the secretary of state says
 
05:27:06.548 --> 05:27:06.558 align:start position:0%
when you've won stop talking
 
05:27:09.110 --> 05:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
representative woods
 
05:27:12.310 --> 05:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
just for my own clarification um
 
05:27:14.708 --> 05:27:14.718 align:start position:0%
the side by side includes this business
 
05:27:17.510 --> 05:27:17.520 align:start position:0%
about the
 
05:27:19.030 --> 05:27:19.040 align:start position:0%
individual being able to test
 
05:27:20.548 --> 05:27:20.558 align:start position:0%
independently but
 
05:27:22.708 --> 05:27:22.718 align:start position:0%
we have the amendment
 
05:27:25.110 --> 05:27:25.120 align:start position:0%
from last fall and i'm not sure what is
 
05:27:27.190 --> 05:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
actually in play here
 
05:27:29.350 --> 05:27:29.360 align:start position:0%
uh at this juncture
 
05:27:32.868 --> 05:27:32.878 align:start position:0%
um because the amendment uh from our
 
05:27:35.590 --> 05:27:35.600 align:start position:0%
committee on house bill 503
 
05:27:38.788 --> 05:27:38.798 align:start position:0%
as of uh last october does not include
 
05:27:38.798 --> 05:27:40.230 align:start position:0%
as of uh last october does not include
that

05:27:40.230 --> 05:27:40.240 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:27:42.708 --> 05:27:42.718 align:start position:0%
but the side by side did
 
05:27:44.948 --> 05:27:44.958 align:start position:0%
does that mean the senate added
 
05:27:48.548 --> 05:27:48.558 align:start position:0%
 
05:27:50.948 --> 05:27:50.958 align:start position:0%
on pay on page um
 
05:27:52.628 --> 05:27:52.638 align:start position:0%
i thought there were pages yeah there's
 
05:27:53.990 --> 05:27:54.000 align:start position:0%
no pages on it which makes it a little
 
05:27:55.830 --> 05:27:55.840 align:start position:0%
difficult uh on the last
 
05:27:57.430 --> 05:27:57.440 align:start position:0%
full page
 
05:27:57.440 --> 05:27:58.788 align:start position:0%
full page
um

05:27:58.788 --> 05:27:58.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
05:28:01.350 --> 05:28:01.360 align:start position:0%
uh it talks about uh the bill authorizes
 
05:28:02.628 --> 05:28:02.638 align:start position:0%
the laboratory testing without a
 
05:28:19.110 --> 05:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:21.350 --> 05:28:21.360 align:start position:0%
um it's nice
 
05:28:23.030 --> 05:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
the same from numbers
 
05:28:24.708 --> 05:28:24.718 align:start position:0%
my apologies
 
05:28:27.110 --> 05:28:27.120 align:start position:0%
stapled things like i i think i have
 
05:28:30.070 --> 05:28:30.080 align:start position:0%
enough to make my decision and
 
05:28:32.150 --> 05:28:32.160 align:start position:0%
the chair wishes to apologize to
 
05:28:34.070 --> 05:28:34.080 align:start position:0%
representative cofoult i promised would
 
05:28:35.910 --> 05:28:35.920 align:start position:0%
be out of here by 3 20 something and
 
05:28:37.590 --> 05:28:37.600 align:start position:0%
it's not going to happen
 
05:28:39.510 --> 05:28:39.520 align:start position:0%
we're getting close
 
05:28:43.190 --> 05:28:43.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:28:46.548 --> 05:28:46.558 align:start position:0%

we had also um which
 
05:28:59.350 --> 05:28:59.360 align:start position:0%
