our previous kind of overview of the
 
00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 align:start position:0%
budget that we provided to you
 
00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:01.039 align:start position:0%

well
 
00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 align:start position:0%
i wanted to start out with there are a
 
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
couple of changes that we
 
00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 align:start position:0%
are requesting in the budget and we
 
00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 align:start position:0%
provided that information to mickey
 
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 align:start position:0%
and not really an unusual um development
 
00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:15.120 align:start position:0%
in the sense that
 
00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:16.400 align:start position:0%
you know when we start doing these
 
00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 align:start position:0%
budgets we do them quite a long time in
 
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 align:start position:0%
advance and so stuff happens
 
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh over time and we need to we find that
 
00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:24.720 align:start position:0%
we're in a position of needing to adjust
 
00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:26.070 align:start position:0%
we're in a position of needing to adjust
it

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
one of those adjustments that we are
 
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 align:start position:0%
asking for
 
00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:32.560 align:start position:0%
is a uh a position in our bureau of
 
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.310 align:start position:0%
is a uh a position in our bureau of
credentialing

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 align:start position:0%
and this is associated with our bus
 
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.070 align:start position:0%
and this is associated with our bus
driver

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 align:start position:0%
driver
 
00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 align:start position:0%
uh credentialing that was a bill that
 
00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:41.280 align:start position:0%
was passed in the last legislative
 
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.629 align:start position:0%
was passed in the last legislative
session

00:05:42.629 --> 00:05:42.639 align:start position:0%
session
 
00:05:45.749 --> 00:05:45.759 align:start position:0%
and it became effective on january 1st
 
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 align:start position:0%
so we couldn't
 
00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 align:start position:0%
apply for a position to put it into our
 
00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.150 align:start position:0%
apply for a position to put it into our
budget

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
budget
 
00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:52.479 align:start position:0%
because we didn't have uh the bill
 
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 align:start position:0%
hadn't gone into effect yet so we
 
00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 align:start position:0%
couldn't apply to
 
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
dop to get the position that happened on
 
00:05:59.189 --> 00:05:59.199 align:start position:0%
january one we've applied and gotten the
 
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 align:start position:0%
position or we're getting the position
 
00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 align:start position:0%
so now we just need to add the funding
 
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 align:start position:0%
for this bus driver
 
00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:07.520 align:start position:0%
credentialing person so just for
 
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:09.120 align:start position:0%
contacts for those of you who are not
 
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 align:start position:0%
through that
 
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
previous legislative session presently
 
00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 align:start position:0%
background checks on school bus drivers
 
00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720 align:start position:0%
are performed
 
00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:20.080 align:start position:0%
locally at each individual district this
 
00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:22.720 align:start position:0%
sometimes results in a hardship to the
 
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.350 align:start position:0%
sometimes results in a hardship to the
districts

00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:23.360 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:25.520 align:start position:0%
and the bus drivers in the sense that
 
00:06:27.909 --> 00:06:27.919 align:start position:0%
you may have a bus driver who drives for
 
00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:29.039 align:start position:0%
multiple districts
 
00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 align:start position:0%
in fact i was on the call this morning
 
00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:32.479 align:start position:0%
about a bus driver incident a bus driver
 
00:06:34.309 --> 00:06:34.319 align:start position:0%
who drives for two separate districts
 
00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:36.160 align:start position:0%
and as a result of that the way the
 
00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:38.560 align:start position:0%
current the previous law had read
 
00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
that bus driver had to get two separate
 
00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 align:start position:0%
background checks one from each district
 
00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:44.160 align:start position:0%
in which they drove because they were
 
00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:45.759 align:start position:0%
not permitted to share that information
 
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880 align:start position:0%
between districts
 
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 align:start position:0%
and so they have consolidated that
 
00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:50.319 align:start position:0%
activity at the
 
00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
agency and so we will be running the
 
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:53.909 align:start position:0%
agency and so we will be running the
back

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:53.919 align:start position:0%
back
 
00:06:56.390 --> 00:06:56.400 align:start position:0%
the bus driver background checks going
 
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 align:start position:0%
forward and
 
00:07:01.589 --> 00:07:01.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:03.919 align:start position:0%
the second item that i wanted to bring
 
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:05.840 align:start position:0%
to your attention is a position that we
 
00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:06.230 align:start position:0%
to your attention is a position that we
have

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:08.080 align:start position:0%
in one of our bureaus that we want to
 
00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 align:start position:0%
move to a different bureau
 
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 align:start position:0%
this is part of what i would refer to as
 
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:15.520 align:start position:0%
kind of ongoing reorganization
 
00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 align:start position:0%
and so we will be consolidating some of
 
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 align:start position:0%
our activities in our bureau of learner
 
00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.189 align:start position:0%
our activities in our bureau of learner
support

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:21.199 align:start position:0%
support
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
and wanted to move a position that we
 
00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:28.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:31.189 --> 00:07:31.199 align:start position:0%
place in the organization to be able to
 
00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:32.479 align:start position:0%
facilitate that
 
00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:35.039 align:start position:0%
um and so you'll see that transfer as
 
00:07:35.039 --> 00:07:35.990 align:start position:0%
um and so you'll see that transfer as
well

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:07:39.029 --> 00:07:39.039 align:start position:0%
that we've put there for you and then
 
00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:40.240 align:start position:0%
the last item
 
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:43.280 align:start position:0%
that we had shared with you are two
 
00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:46.400 align:start position:0%
that grant received after the budgeting
 
00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.990 align:start position:0%
that grant received after the budgeting
process

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.000 align:start position:0%
process
 
00:07:49.909 --> 00:07:49.919 align:start position:0%
primarily because they had to go through
 
00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:52.240 align:start position:0%
a an mou process with the department of
 
00:07:53.990 --> 00:07:54.000 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:56.160 align:start position:0%
and these are grants associated with our
 
00:07:57.749 --> 00:07:57.759 align:start position:0%
promising future grants that we are
 
00:07:59.749 --> 00:07:59.759 align:start position:0%
making to schools as well as our purple
 
00:07:59.759 --> 00:08:00.550 align:start position:0%
making to schools as well as our purple
star

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:00.560 align:start position:0%
star
 
00:08:03.909 --> 00:08:03.919 align:start position:0%
grant program this is a funding that
 
00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:04.720 align:start position:0%
comes to us
 
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:06.580 align:start position:0%
through the um
 
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:07.749 align:start position:0%
through the um
[Music]

00:08:07.749 --> 00:08:07.759 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:08:09.990 --> 00:08:10.000 align:start position:0%
the bdas so the bureau of drug and
 
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.510 align:start position:0%
the bdas so the bureau of drug and
alcohol

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:11.520 align:start position:0%
alcohol
 
00:08:14.469 --> 00:08:14.479 align:start position:0%
activities they provided a grant to us
 
00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:15.430 align:start position:0%
activities they provided a grant to us
via

00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:15.440 align:start position:0%
via
 
00:08:17.909 --> 00:08:17.919 align:start position:0%
health and human services to provide
 
00:08:19.749 --> 00:08:19.759 align:start position:0%
support to schools for
 
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
preventative funding programs and so
 
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:23.680 align:start position:0%
that is the other
 
00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:25.199 align:start position:0%
item and i think when we sent that over
 
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:26.960 align:start position:0%
to you we also included the
 
00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:29.440 align:start position:0%
um fiscal items that would have gone
 
00:08:30.390 --> 00:08:30.400 align:start position:0%
through the fiscal
 
00:08:33.509 --> 00:08:33.519 align:start position:0%
process as well um so those are three
 
00:08:36.469 --> 00:08:36.479 align:start position:0%
um of the the modifications that i think
 
00:08:36.479 --> 00:08:36.949 align:start position:0%
um of the the modifications that i think
we

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:36.959 align:start position:0%
we
 
00:08:39.269 --> 00:08:39.279 align:start position:0%
are going to ask that if you can help us
 
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
just tune up our budget going into this
 
00:08:44.389 --> 00:08:44.399 align:start position:0%
process that would be helpful to us um
 
00:08:44.399 --> 00:08:44.790 align:start position:0%
process that would be helpful to us um
and

00:08:44.790 --> 00:08:44.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:08:46.949 --> 00:08:46.959 align:start position:0%
with that said i will then pause and
 
00:08:49.670 --> 00:08:49.680 align:start position:0%
really can kind of respond to
 
00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:51.440 align:start position:0%
questions that you may have about the
 
00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:00.949 --> 00:09:00.959 align:start position:0%
rep representative thank you madam chair
 
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:02.800 align:start position:0%
um and thank you commissioner just could
 
00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:04.959 align:start position:0%
you um talk a little bit more about the
 
00:09:06.389 --> 00:09:06.399 align:start position:0%
changes in positions
 
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:10.000 align:start position:0%
that you just described sure so
 
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
there's in are you talking about the
 
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
last one that we talked about
 
00:09:15.829 --> 00:09:15.839 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so this is a position it's an
 
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:16.720 align:start position:0%
admin for
 
00:09:19.509 --> 00:09:19.519 align:start position:0%
that is in the bureau of uh it's in the
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
title 4b bureau
 
00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:23.360 align:start position:0%
and then tammy where is it going to like
 
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:26.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:28.230 --> 00:09:28.240 align:start position:0%
the bureau of instructional support is i
 
00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920 align:start position:0%
think where it goes to exactly
 
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:32.880 align:start position:0%
yeah so this is a position mary i'm just
 
00:09:33.829 --> 00:09:33.839 align:start position:0%
going back a little bit you might
 
00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
remember you had
 
00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:38.240 align:start position:0%
julie couch who's overseeing the
 
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.120 align:start position:0%
the assessment and the title program so
 
00:09:44.389 --> 00:09:44.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:55.269 --> 00:09:55.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:57.590 --> 00:09:57.600 align:start position:0%
excuse me i had to get some coffee no
 
00:09:59.269 --> 00:09:59.279 align:start position:0%
worries at all
 
00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:00.480 align:start position:0%
i mean i don't know if there are any
 
00:10:02.470 --> 00:10:02.480 align:start position:0%
specific questions i mean we can
 
00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:03.920 align:start position:0%
follow up on some of the questions that
 
00:10:05.509 --> 00:10:05.519 align:start position:0%
we had from the last time
 
00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:08.880 align:start position:0%
i have had um some variety of different
 
00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:10.880 align:start position:0%
outreach specifically around the dual
 
00:10:12.630 --> 00:10:12.640 align:start position:0%
and concurrent so i but i know that
 
00:10:14.310 --> 00:10:14.320 align:start position:0%
that's a topic of conversation and
 
00:10:16.389 --> 00:10:16.399 align:start position:0%
everybody's having dialogue around it
 
00:10:17.990 --> 00:10:18.000 align:start position:0%
i'm happy to answer any additional
 
00:10:20.389 --> 00:10:20.399 align:start position:0%
questions um at the department we still
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a program better
 
00:10:21.839 --> 00:10:22.630 align:start position:0%
believe that that's a program better
housed

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
housed
 
00:10:24.949 --> 00:10:24.959 align:start position:0%
through the community college system
 
00:10:26.389 --> 00:10:26.399 align:start position:0%
than at the department because we're
 
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:28.640 align:start position:0%
really just a pass-through organization
 
00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:31.600 align:start position:0%
um not adding value to that process and
 
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.310 align:start position:0%
um not adding value to that process and
so

00:10:32.310 --> 00:10:32.320 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.600 align:start position:0%
i would encourage that that to be
 
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:37.680 align:start position:0%
a program embedded at community college
 
00:10:38.949 --> 00:10:38.959 align:start position:0%
maybe more than the department of
 
00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:40.230 align:start position:0%
maybe more than the department of
education

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
education
 
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:42.000 align:start position:0%
um because essentially we just get an
 
00:10:43.430 --> 00:10:43.440 align:start position:0%
invoice from them and then we pay the
 
00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:44.829 align:start position:0%
invoice from them and then we pay the
invoice

00:10:44.829 --> 00:10:44.839 align:start position:0%
invoice
 
00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:47.680 align:start position:0%
so representative heath
 
00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:50.560 align:start position:0%
oh thank you madam chair um it is so
 
00:10:52.470 --> 00:10:52.480 align:start position:0%
disappointing about dual enrollment i
 
00:10:54.470 --> 00:10:54.480 align:start position:0%
actually was just having a conversation
 
00:10:56.790 --> 00:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
with someone this morning about that
 
00:10:59.509 --> 00:10:59.519 align:start position:0%
um and i've spoken with susan heward and
 
00:10:59.519 --> 00:11:00.069 align:start position:0%
um and i've spoken with susan heward and
best

00:11:00.069 --> 00:11:00.079 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:11:02.949 --> 00:11:02.959 align:start position:0%
dorian from the program i am really
 
00:11:04.949 --> 00:11:04.959 align:start position:0%
hopeful that we can do something because
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
the impact will be 6 000
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
students that have benefited from that
 
00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.389 align:start position:0%
students that have benefited from that
program

00:11:10.389 --> 00:11:10.399 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:12.959 align:start position:0%
over the years and it just it makes such
 
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:14.000 align:start position:0%
a huge difference
 
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.240 align:start position:0%
to families because so many kids go on
 
00:11:19.110 --> 00:11:19.120 align:start position:0%
to college and have those extra credits
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
so um anything that you can do from your
 
00:11:23.670 --> 00:11:23.680 align:start position:0%
side would be appreciated and hopefully
 
00:11:25.829 --> 00:11:25.839 align:start position:0%
we can do something from our side
 
00:11:28.550 --> 00:11:28.560 align:start position:0%
but um if i may madam chair i do have a
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
couple of
 
00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:31.360 align:start position:0%
questions um on the first section of the
 
00:11:33.269 --> 00:11:33.279 align:start position:0%

ma'am cheer
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
i think my question is going to be for
 
00:12:12.470 --> 00:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
tammy in combination with the
 
00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:13.750 align:start position:0%
tammy in combination with the
commissioner

commissioner
 
00:12:16.790 --> 00:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
but there are increases in the general
 
00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:17.680 align:start position:0%
fund lines
 
00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:20.399 align:start position:0%
in the office of the commissioner and in
 
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:22.880 align:start position:0%

00:12:28.629 --> 00:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
why there are those increases and the
 
00:12:28.639 --> 00:12:29.670 align:start position:0%
why there are those increases and the
changes

00:12:29.670 --> 00:12:29.680 align:start position:0%
changes
 
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:31.680 align:start position:0%

wait a second yes for the office of the

commissioner
 
00:12:54.389 --> 00:12:54.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:59.670 --> 00:12:59.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
i want you to lock the page i'm sorry
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
um i think it's uh uh yeah it's the next
 
00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.269 align:start position:0%
um i think it's uh uh yeah it's the next
page

00:13:07.269 --> 00:13:07.279 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:13:10.949 --> 00:13:10.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:13.590 --> 00:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
just in the line of the it's gone from
 
00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.470 align:start position:0%
just in the line of the it's gone from
um

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:14.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:18.829 --> 00:13:18.839 align:start position:0%
well in 90 um in 2021
 
00:13:21.990 --> 00:13:22.000 align:start position:0%
1.2 almost 1.3 million and it go
 
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:24.320 align:start position:0%
oh well actually it's it's not that big
 
00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:26.399 align:start position:0%
increase so is that the new position
 
00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
that you added to your staff no i don't
 
00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:31.360 align:start position:0%
think so tammy can weigh in if i just go
 
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:32.560 align:start position:0%
back up i think what you're going to
 
00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:34.320 align:start position:0%
find is
 
00:13:37.670 --> 00:13:37.680 align:start position:0%
that you see in the personnel so both
 
00:13:39.590 --> 00:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
you know we had raises so as you know
 
00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:41.360 align:start position:0%
that there's the normal step increases
 
00:13:42.230 --> 00:13:42.240 align:start position:0%
that people are
 
00:13:44.389 --> 00:13:44.399 align:start position:0%
awarded okay as well as the benefit
 
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:46.720 align:start position:0%
costs are increasing
 
00:13:47.990 --> 00:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
i'm just going through the different
 
00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:49.920 align:start position:0%
line items
 
00:13:51.509 --> 00:13:51.519 align:start position:0%
you know so the biggest is there's about
 
00:13:53.670 --> 00:13:53.680 align:start position:0%
a 36 000
 
00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480 align:start position:0%
increases in step increases for the
 
00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160 align:start position:0%
people who are in the
 
00:13:59.750 --> 00:13:59.760 align:start position:0%
office of the commissioner which is
 
00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:00.800 align:start position:0%
going to include i believe the
 
00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:02.959 align:start position:0%
commissioner our communications person
 
00:14:05.910 --> 00:14:05.920 align:start position:0%
um our administrative uh support and who
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
else is in there tammy
 
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:10.880 align:start position:0%
uh the receptionist and the receptionist
 
00:14:12.629 --> 00:14:12.639 align:start position:0%
and actually so that might be driving
 
00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:14.160 align:start position:0%
some of the three representatives of its
 
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:16.480 align:start position:0%
receptionist because if you recall
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
um that was a position that was unfilled
 
00:14:19.990 --> 00:14:20.000 align:start position:0%
for a period of time
 
00:14:22.310 --> 00:14:22.320 align:start position:0%
and was cost shared among some of the
 
00:14:23.750 --> 00:14:23.760 align:start position:0%
other bureaus
 
00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:25.040 align:start position:0%
i think probably that's when you were
 
00:14:27.189 --> 00:14:27.199 align:start position:0%
here remember like every every bureau
 
00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:28.560 align:start position:0%
used to kick in a little bit
 
00:14:32.069 --> 00:14:32.079 align:start position:0%
for the reception um and really it was
 
00:14:33.509 --> 00:14:33.519 align:start position:0%
difficult to
 
00:14:35.269 --> 00:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
to manage that from a compliance
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
standpoint because of the federal funds
 
00:14:38.230 --> 00:14:38.240 align:start position:0%
that were coming in there
 
00:14:40.230 --> 00:14:40.240 align:start position:0%
so now this is a fully funded in the
 
00:14:41.509 --> 00:14:41.519 align:start position:0%
general funds type of
 
00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:44.480 align:start position:0%
makes good sense and is as it should be
 
00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:44.790 align:start position:0%
makes good sense and is as it should be
and

00:14:44.790 --> 00:14:44.800 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:47.600 align:start position:0%
in the office of the deputy uh now that
 
00:14:48.949 --> 00:14:48.959 align:start position:0%
general fun line
 
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:53.040 align:start position:0%
has increased um from 635
 
00:14:56.790 --> 00:14:56.800 align:start position:0%
000 now to 740 000. what are the changes
 
00:14:59.750 --> 00:14:59.760 align:start position:0%
in that line from please
 
00:15:02.389 --> 00:15:02.399 align:start position:0%
so most of this is around is if you'll
 
00:15:04.069 --> 00:15:04.079 align:start position:0%
see where we're driving it if you go
 
00:15:05.430 --> 00:15:05.440 align:start position:0%
just up half you can see there's some
 
00:15:05.440 --> 00:15:05.990 align:start position:0%
just up half you can see there's some
decline

00:15:05.990 --> 00:15:06.000 align:start position:0%
decline
 
00:15:08.310 --> 00:15:08.320 align:start position:0%
some increases and some decreases so we
 
00:15:09.269 --> 00:15:09.279 align:start position:0%
took out
 
00:15:10.949 --> 00:15:10.959 align:start position:0%
some funding out of the professional
 
00:15:13.030 --> 00:15:13.040 align:start position:0%
development specific to
 
00:15:14.949 --> 00:15:14.959 align:start position:0%
staff members at the department
 
00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:16.800 align:start position:0%
primarily because people we had put a
 
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:17.760 align:start position:0%
certain amount in
 
00:15:19.829 --> 00:15:19.839 align:start position:0%
and it wasn't being used as much as we
 
00:15:21.829 --> 00:15:21.839 align:start position:0%
thought it was going to be used
 
00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:24.160 align:start position:0%
where we were paying for people who take
 
00:15:25.990 --> 00:15:26.000 align:start position:0%
post-secondary opportunities and stuff
 
00:15:29.829 --> 00:15:29.839 align:start position:0%
like that we are continuing to encourage
 
00:15:31.269 --> 00:15:31.279 align:start position:0%
professional development around stuff
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
like you know getting your excel skills
 
00:15:34.550 --> 00:15:34.560 align:start position:0%
up to speed
 
00:15:37.110 --> 00:15:37.120 align:start position:0%
um in particular a lot of adobe work is
 
00:15:38.389 --> 00:15:38.399 align:start position:0%
going on because we're doing a lot of
 
00:15:40.870 --> 00:15:40.880 align:start position:0%
workflow stuff in terms of automation
 
00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:42.160 align:start position:0%
but then if you go down into the
 
00:15:44.310 --> 00:15:44.320 align:start position:0%
contracts what you'll see is there's a
 
00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:45.509 align:start position:0%
contracts what you'll see is there's a
communications

00:15:45.509 --> 00:15:45.519 align:start position:0%
communications
 
00:15:48.230 --> 00:15:48.240 align:start position:0%
increase and this is we've got our kind
 
00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:50.160 align:start position:0%
of a full-time communications person
 
00:15:51.990 --> 00:15:52.000 align:start position:0%
but what we've discovered is that
 
00:15:53.509 --> 00:15:53.519 align:start position:0%
getting messaging out
 
00:15:56.069 --> 00:15:56.079 align:start position:0%
to people um is just vitally important
 
00:15:56.079 --> 00:15:56.949 align:start position:0%
to people um is just vitally important
particularly

00:15:56.949 --> 00:15:56.959 align:start position:0%
particularly
 
00:15:58.870 --> 00:15:58.880 align:start position:0%
in the pandemic we've discovered how
 
00:16:00.629 --> 00:16:00.639 align:start position:0%
important it is and so we're working
 
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:02.160 align:start position:0%
primarily with cookson
 
00:16:05.269 --> 00:16:05.279 align:start position:0%
to do a variety of like pdf type
 
00:16:05.279 --> 00:16:06.230 align:start position:0%
to do a variety of like pdf type
documents

00:16:06.230 --> 00:16:06.240 align:start position:0%
documents
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
that we allow uh the schools to have
 
00:16:11.269 --> 00:16:11.279 align:start position:0%
to communicate stuff i think i might
 
00:16:12.949 --> 00:16:12.959 align:start position:0%
have shared with you last time
 
00:16:14.710 --> 00:16:14.720 align:start position:0%
one that we did around the food and
 
00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
nutrition how we created a
 
00:16:18.710 --> 00:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
like a document that the schools could
 
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:20.240 align:start position:0%
use to send home to
 
00:16:22.069 --> 00:16:22.079 align:start position:0%
their families about the importance of
 
00:16:23.990 --> 00:16:24.000 align:start position:0%
signing up for free and reduced lunch
 
00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.790 align:start position:0%
signing up for free and reduced lunch
stuff

00:16:24.790 --> 00:16:24.800 align:start position:0%
stuff
 
00:16:27.269 --> 00:16:27.279 align:start position:0%
um so and then for example at noon today
 
00:16:28.949 --> 00:16:28.959 align:start position:0%
i'll be sharing a document
 
00:16:31.509 --> 00:16:31.519 align:start position:0%
uh around the educator vaccinations
 
00:16:33.189 --> 00:16:33.199 align:start position:0%
right so what we've really done is kind
 
00:16:34.389 --> 00:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
of professionalize some of this
 
00:16:35.990 --> 00:16:36.000 align:start position:0%
communication to make it easier
 
00:16:39.670 --> 00:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
for for us as well as the schools to get
 
00:16:43.350 --> 00:16:43.360 align:start position:0%
a consistent message out to the whole
 
00:16:46.470 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%
population and i don't know if
 
00:16:48.389 --> 00:16:48.399 align:start position:0%
i have screen share i can give you an
 
00:16:50.310 --> 00:16:50.320 align:start position:0%
example of what one of those might look
 
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.360 align:start position:0%
like if that's helpful
 
00:16:55.189 --> 00:16:55.199 align:start position:0%
would i don't know if that'd be useful
 
00:16:57.590 --> 00:16:57.600 align:start position:0%
yes commissioner i would appreciate that
 
00:16:58.870 --> 00:16:58.880 align:start position:0%
okay let me get i'm going to show you
 
00:17:00.949 --> 00:17:00.959 align:start position:0%
one that this is how you guys shouldn't
 
00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
be sharing this with me yet because it
 
00:17:03.990 --> 00:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
hasn't gone public but i'm gonna
 
00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360 align:start position:0%
this is i don't think there's too many
 
00:17:07.110 --> 00:17:07.120 align:start position:0%
people paying attention here so as an
 
00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:07.909 align:start position:0%
people paying attention here so as an
example

00:17:07.909 --> 00:17:07.919 align:start position:0%
example
 
00:17:09.270 --> 00:17:09.280 align:start position:0%
here's what we'll be sharing with our
 
00:17:11.110 --> 00:17:11.120 align:start position:0%
school leaders i think you should be
 
00:17:11.829 --> 00:17:11.839 align:start position:0%
able to see
 
00:17:16.230 --> 00:17:16.240 align:start position:0%
that right now yes phase 2a
 
00:17:18.309 --> 00:17:18.319 align:start position:0%
yes yeah so these are the kinds of
 
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
things that we put together
 
00:17:21.829 --> 00:17:21.839 align:start position:0%
that we then provide to the schools and
 
00:17:23.029 --> 00:17:23.039 align:start position:0%
then we put you know you can put them
 
00:17:24.470 --> 00:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
out on social media
 
00:17:26.630 --> 00:17:26.640 align:start position:0%
and it's like who and how you get done
 
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:28.160 align:start position:0%
and how you get the vaccine and stuff
 
00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:29.360 align:start position:0%
like that so
 
00:17:32.390 --> 00:17:32.400 align:start position:0%
these are the types of um
 
00:17:34.710 --> 00:17:34.720 align:start position:0%
documents that we anticipate being able
 
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:35.750 align:start position:0%
documents that we anticipate being able
to

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:35.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:17:37.510 --> 00:17:37.520 align:start position:0%
share with people to be able to just
 
00:17:38.950 --> 00:17:38.960 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody stayed on the same
 
00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:40.230 align:start position:0%
make sure everybody stayed on the same
page

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:40.240 align:start position:0%
page
 
00:17:45.350 --> 00:17:45.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240 align:start position:0%
uh representative petrie you have a
 
00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:49.669 align:start position:0%
uh representative petrie you have a
question

00:17:49.669 --> 00:17:49.679 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:17:52.150 --> 00:17:52.160 align:start position:0%
could if we could um let's just stay
 
00:17:53.590 --> 00:17:53.600 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner and the deputy
 
00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:54.230 align:start position:0%
with the commissioner and the deputy
commissioner

00:17:54.230 --> 00:17:54.240 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:57.520 align:start position:0%
until everybody has asked all the
 
00:17:59.350 --> 00:17:59.360 align:start position:0%
questions that they uh
 
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:01.840 align:start position:0%
want to ask on that so joe is your
 
00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:02.549 align:start position:0%
want to ask on that so joe is your
question

00:18:02.549 --> 00:18:02.559 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:18:04.070 --> 00:18:04.080 align:start position:0%
on the commissioner or deputy
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
commissioner yeah
 
00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:08.640 align:start position:0%
it uh thank you madam chair uh uh
 
00:18:10.950 --> 00:18:10.960 align:start position:0%
welcome again uh commissioner frank uh
 
00:18:14.310 --> 00:18:14.320 align:start position:0%
you've been here before um the question
 
00:18:15.669 --> 00:18:15.679 align:start position:0%
is uh
 
00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
what are your concerns on the emergency
 
00:18:19.430 --> 00:18:19.440 align:start position:0%
between the community college system
 
00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:22.480 align:start position:0%
and the university system so i'm
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
actually quite
 
00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:26.640 align:start position:0%
comfortable with the uh the proposal by
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
the governor to do that and i think that
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
the way that he has done that um is
 
00:18:34.070 --> 00:18:34.080 align:start position:0%
in such a way that we don't have to
 
00:18:35.909 --> 00:18:35.919 align:start position:0%
answer all of the questions but if you
 
00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:38.240 align:start position:0%
think about the primary driver here
 
00:18:40.789 --> 00:18:40.799 align:start position:0%
is a combined oversight board between
 
00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:42.000 align:start position:0%
the community college
 
00:18:44.549 --> 00:18:44.559 align:start position:0%
system and the university system and
 
00:18:44.559 --> 00:18:45.510 align:start position:0%
system and the university system and
then

00:18:45.510 --> 00:18:45.520 align:start position:0%
then
 
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:47.760 align:start position:0%
that collective board is then able to
 
00:18:49.510 --> 00:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
work out a lot of the details in terms
 
00:18:51.750 --> 00:18:51.760 align:start position:0%
of what that might look like
 
00:18:54.630 --> 00:18:54.640 align:start position:0%
i have been an advocate all along for
 
00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:55.669 align:start position:0%
i have been an advocate all along for
creating

00:18:55.669 --> 00:18:55.679 align:start position:0%
creating
 
00:18:58.630 --> 00:18:58.640 align:start position:0%
uh you know seamless pathways for uh
 
00:19:00.390 --> 00:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
students in our system
 
00:19:04.230 --> 00:19:04.240 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is a a policy that
 
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:04.710 align:start position:0%
and i think that this is a a policy that
is

00:19:04.710 --> 00:19:04.720 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:19:06.789 --> 00:19:06.799 align:start position:0%
also consistent with that of in terms of
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
trying to create
 
00:19:09.990 --> 00:19:10.000 align:start position:0%
seamless pathways for students to be
 
00:19:11.350 --> 00:19:11.360 align:start position:0%
able to move forward
 
00:19:13.350 --> 00:19:13.360 align:start position:0%
um i don't know that we've necessarily
 
00:19:15.350 --> 00:19:15.360 align:start position:0%
worked out all of the details
 
00:19:17.029 --> 00:19:17.039 align:start position:0%
nor do i know that we have to but
 
00:19:19.669 --> 00:19:19.679 align:start position:0%
because by creating that combined board
 
00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440 align:start position:0%
we really create a governance structure
 
00:19:26.789 --> 00:19:26.799 align:start position:0%
that can move forward those policies to
 
00:19:26.799 --> 00:19:27.669 align:start position:0%
that can move forward those policies to
allow

00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
allow
 
00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
um you know the objectives of seamless
 
00:19:33.270 --> 00:19:33.280 align:start position:0%
uh you know access as well as some of
 
00:19:34.789 --> 00:19:34.799 align:start position:0%
the concerns that people have about
 
00:19:36.150 --> 00:19:36.160 align:start position:0%
integrating two systems
 
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:39.120 align:start position:0%
that would be my perspective excuse me
 
00:19:40.710 --> 00:19:40.720 align:start position:0%
madam chair um
 
00:19:42.070 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
as i think i mentioned to you i'm gonna
 
00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:43.760 align:start position:0%
have to leave for a little at least a
 
00:19:44.710 --> 00:19:44.720 align:start position:0%

two hearings on my bills but i'll be

that's who we have right now just
 
00:20:51.909 --> 00:20:51.919 align:start position:0%
you know point of interest his dad
 
00:20:54.149 --> 00:20:54.159 align:start position:0%
taught me advanced music theory
 
00:21:01.350 --> 00:21:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:05.590 --> 00:21:05.600 align:start position:0%
okay i do have a question on
 
00:21:08.789 --> 00:21:08.799 align:start position:0%
this is on uh page
 
00:21:12.070 --> 00:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
1 119 5
 
00:21:14.789 --> 00:21:14.799 align:start position:0%
which is dealing with the national
 
00:21:18.870 --> 00:21:18.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:22.240 align:start position:0%
how is that i assume it's distributed to
 
00:21:23.669 --> 00:21:23.679 align:start position:0%
the communities
 
00:21:27.909 --> 00:21:27.919 align:start position:0%
that have um national forest as part of
 
00:21:27.919 --> 00:21:29.590 align:start position:0%
that have um national forest as part of
their

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
their
 
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:32.720 align:start position:0%
life how do we
 
00:21:35.909 --> 00:21:35.919 align:start position:0%
distribute that money to
 
00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:40.080 align:start position:0%
the towns so it is a formula grant i
 
00:21:42.070 --> 00:21:42.080 align:start position:0%
don't know
 
00:21:44.789 --> 00:21:44.799 align:start position:0%
yes when we receive those funds from the
 
00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:46.960 align:start position:0%
feds they actually tell us who we need
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
to distribute those funds to
 
00:21:50.789 --> 00:21:50.799 align:start position:0%
and there's an individual in my office
 
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:53.200 align:start position:0%
that reaches out to the towns if there's
 
00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039 align:start position:0%
any question as to whether or not it's
 
00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:55.760 align:start position:0%
going to
 
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:58.240 align:start position:0%
a district or if it's going directly to
 
00:21:58.870 --> 00:21:58.880 align:start position:0%
the town
 
00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:01.520 align:start position:0%
so it's not one answer if it's all it
 
00:22:03.110 --> 00:22:03.120 align:start position:0%
depends on the
 
00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:16.870 --> 00:22:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:19.440 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
 
00:22:19.440 --> 00:22:21.510 align:start position:0%
okay are there any further questions
there

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:21.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none uh
 
00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:37.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:42.640 align:start position:0%
okay um sorry representative murray
 
00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:44.640 align:start position:0%
um can you just speak briefly to i see i
 
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:46.480 align:start position:0%
know their federal funds but um it looks
 
00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:48.080 align:start position:0%
like it's a new grant for preschool
 
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:49.840 align:start position:0%
development on 1198
 
00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:51.520 align:start position:0%
can you just give a few words about what
 
00:22:53.270 --> 00:22:53.280 align:start position:0%
that means that looks i mean i'm down
 
00:22:55.029 --> 00:22:55.039 align:start position:0%
with preschool education here
 
00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:58.240 align:start position:0%
yeah so this was a grant that um
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
we had done a combination of university
 
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:01.600 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:23:03.110 --> 00:23:03.120 align:start position:0%
department of education department of
 
00:23:04.789 --> 00:23:04.799 align:start position:0%
health and human services
 
00:23:07.270 --> 00:23:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh we applied for that grant and won it
 
00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:09.360 align:start position:0%
we're now about 18 months into that
 
00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
award that we won that grant
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
so it wasn't in our previous budget but
 
00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:14.240 align:start position:0%
obviously it's going to be in this
 
00:23:15.750 --> 00:23:15.760 align:start position:0%
budget going forward
 
00:23:18.230 --> 00:23:18.240 align:start position:0%
um and it's again work on preschool
 
00:23:20.149 --> 00:23:20.159 align:start position:0%
development grant is what is referred to
 
00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:22.080 align:start position:0%
and it's working on our uh
 
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:25.120 align:start position:0%
early childhood education efforts
 
00:23:27.669 --> 00:23:27.679 align:start position:0%
it was a fairly sizable grant about 33
 
00:23:30.549 --> 00:23:30.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:34.870 --> 00:23:34.880 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah so the 93 that's here
 
00:23:37.990 --> 00:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
is just your part of it that's correct
 
00:23:39.270 --> 00:23:39.280 align:start position:0%
so most of it is run
 
00:23:41.590 --> 00:23:41.600 align:start position:0%
through the university system of new
 
00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:42.630 align:start position:0%
through the university system of new
hampshire

00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:42.640 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:23:44.789 --> 00:23:44.799 align:start position:0%
so they are the fiduciary for the grant
 
00:23:45.909 --> 00:23:45.919 align:start position:0%
and this is our
 
00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:47.760 align:start position:0%
staff so in the grant we wrote up
 
00:23:49.110 --> 00:23:49.120 align:start position:0%
certain positions
 
00:23:51.430 --> 00:23:51.440 align:start position:0%
at the department to manage our portion
 
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:53.600 align:start position:0%
of that along with the staff from
 
00:23:56.390 --> 00:23:56.400 align:start position:0%
hhs has some people in it as well as the
 
00:23:57.990 --> 00:23:58.000 align:start position:0%
university system has
 
00:23:59.590 --> 00:23:59.600 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the funding associated with
 
00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:01.350 align:start position:0%
the bulk of the funding associated with
them

00:24:01.350 --> 00:24:01.360 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:05.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you and mostly if it
 
00:24:07.590 --> 00:24:07.600 align:start position:0%
matters most of that funding so this is
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
some staff level positions but most of
 
00:24:11.510 --> 00:24:11.520 align:start position:0%
the money is passed through to
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
uh community grants of that around
 
00:24:15.830 --> 00:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
various uh setting up systems
 
00:24:19.430 --> 00:24:19.440 align:start position:0%
um on a go-forward basis
 
00:24:23.350 --> 00:24:23.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:26.470 --> 00:24:26.480 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um can i
 
00:24:30.830 --> 00:24:30.840 align:start position:0%
jump ahead to um analytics
 
00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah is that all right
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
just just tell us the page all right i
 
00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:37.110 align:start position:0%
just just tell us the page all right i
am

00:24:37.110 --> 00:24:37.120 align:start position:0%
am
 
00:24:40.990 --> 00:24:41.000 align:start position:0%
on page um
 
00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:43.510 align:start position:0%
on page um
1205

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
1205
 
00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:47.200 align:start position:0%
and this is um the line
 
00:24:50.549 --> 00:24:50.559 align:start position:0%
at the bottom general funds where
 
00:24:54.549 --> 00:24:54.559 align:start position:0%
um there's a bump
 
00:24:58.390 --> 00:24:58.400 align:start position:0%
there from 407 to 669 just wondering
 
00:25:01.669 --> 00:25:01.679 align:start position:0%
if that's a new system or or
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
what is happening there so i think that
 
00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:07.600 align:start position:0%
the primary driver is really around um
 
00:25:09.350 --> 00:25:09.360 align:start position:0%
some positions you'll see we went from
 
00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:10.080 align:start position:0%
two to four
 
00:25:11.269 --> 00:25:11.279 align:start position:0%
and if you go up to the top you just
 
00:25:13.750 --> 00:25:13.760 align:start position:0%
look at the personnel you had nothing in
 
00:25:15.269 --> 00:25:15.279 align:start position:0%
there and went from 36k
 
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:18.080 align:start position:0%
to 200 000. and really much of that is
 
00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:19.029 align:start position:0%
to 200 000. and really much of that is
around

00:25:19.029 --> 00:25:19.039 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:25:20.710 --> 00:25:20.720 align:start position:0%
some of the restructuring that was
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
taking place and filling positions
 
00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:26.000 align:start position:0%
that had not been filled in the past
 
00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:26.789 align:start position:0%
that had not been filled in the past
around

00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
around
 
00:25:29.110 --> 00:25:29.120 align:start position:0%
accountability as an example was one of
 
00:25:30.230 --> 00:25:30.240 align:start position:0%
them um
 
00:25:31.990 --> 00:25:32.000 align:start position:0%
and there's another one caitlyn might be
 
00:25:33.669 --> 00:25:33.679 align:start position:0%
on and she might want to jump in and
 
00:25:35.269 --> 00:25:35.279 align:start position:0%
weigh in on this if you want to look for
 
00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:36.480 align:start position:0%
her mickey
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
um in fact i'm gonna pause for a minute
 
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:40.880 align:start position:0%
and just see if she's there she wants to
 
00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:52.470 --> 00:25:52.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:56.390 --> 00:25:56.400 align:start position:0%
hi caitlyn yes i did um so those were
 
00:25:57.590 --> 00:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
actually just positions that were in a
 
00:25:58.630 --> 00:25:58.640 align:start position:0%
different accounting unit that were
 
00:26:00.549 --> 00:26:00.559 align:start position:0%
moved over to this accounting unit um so
 
00:26:01.590 --> 00:26:01.600 align:start position:0%
it was just part of the
 
00:26:02.789 --> 00:26:02.799 align:start position:0%
the organization they're not new
 
00:26:04.230 --> 00:26:04.240 align:start position:0%
positions and they actually were not
 
00:26:05.669 --> 00:26:05.679 align:start position:0%
unfilled positions in the last budget
 
00:26:06.950 --> 00:26:06.960 align:start position:0%
they just weren't necessarily in the
 
00:26:08.390 --> 00:26:08.400 align:start position:0%
appropriate place in the
 
00:26:11.269 --> 00:26:11.279 align:start position:0%
um 20 and 21 budget so thank you that's
 
00:26:11.279 --> 00:26:11.669 align:start position:0%
um 20 and 21 budget so thank you that's
great

00:26:11.669 --> 00:26:11.679 align:start position:0%
great
 
00:26:13.750 --> 00:26:13.760 align:start position:0%
i appreciate it and while katelyn's here
 
00:26:15.029 --> 00:26:15.039 align:start position:0%
can i ask one more
 
00:26:17.269 --> 00:26:17.279 align:start position:0%
question madam cheer please oh
 
00:26:17.279 --> 00:26:18.470 align:start position:0%
question madam cheer please oh
absolutely

00:26:18.470 --> 00:26:18.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:24.240 align:start position:0%
on page 1209 technology software
 
00:26:28.149 --> 00:26:28.159 align:start position:0%
um this um actually it went down
 
00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:31.600 align:start position:0%
but then i was that a purchase that you
 
00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.149 align:start position:0%
but then i was that a purchase that you
made

00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159 align:start position:0%
made
 
00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
in um 21 and then um
 
00:26:40.149 --> 00:26:40.159 align:start position:0%
there's a 401 000 in 22
 
00:26:43.350 --> 00:26:43.360 align:start position:0%
and 375 in 23 is that
 
00:26:46.149 --> 00:26:46.159 align:start position:0%
um the cost to sustain that piece of
 
00:26:46.159 --> 00:26:47.269 align:start position:0%
um the cost to sustain that piece of
software

00:26:47.269 --> 00:26:47.279 align:start position:0%
software
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
no that is not um so the 401 and the 375
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
is actually our ongoing software that we
 
00:26:54.149 --> 00:26:54.159 align:start position:0%
have had
 
00:26:57.430 --> 00:26:57.440 align:start position:0%
continuously so things like our ireport
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
our tableau software things that we've
 
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
been working with um
 
00:27:04.149 --> 00:27:04.159 align:start position:0%
the large purchase was we are have been
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
working strategically to upgrade the
 
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:09.120 align:start position:0%
student information system and the
 
00:27:10.710 --> 00:27:10.720 align:start position:0%
department of education will need
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
a finding level of that additional one
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
and a half million dollars to maintain
 
00:27:17.430 --> 00:27:17.440 align:start position:0%
a new student information software
 
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:18.720 align:start position:0%
however we
 
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:20.320 align:start position:0%
were not given that money right now in
 
00:27:21.590 --> 00:27:21.600 align:start position:0%
this version of the budget so we will
 
00:27:23.590 --> 00:27:23.600 align:start position:0%
not be able to maintain a new student
 
00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:25.679 align:start position:0%
information system at this level
 
00:27:29.590 --> 00:27:29.600 align:start position:0%
and we did have some luck with applying
 
00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:29.909 align:start position:0%
and we did have some luck with applying
for

00:27:29.909 --> 00:27:29.919 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:27:33.750 --> 00:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
federal money to purchase the system
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
and so we are looking to release the rfp
 
00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
momentarily right now for the new system
 
00:27:42.389 --> 00:27:42.399 align:start position:0%
but we will need to increase funding
 
00:27:44.149 --> 00:27:44.159 align:start position:0%
levels to be able to maintain that
 
00:27:45.750 --> 00:27:45.760 align:start position:0%
system going forward
 
00:27:47.830 --> 00:27:47.840 align:start position:0%
so representative you may recall in that
 
00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:48.880 align:start position:0%
previous budget
 
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:51.120 align:start position:0%
this was one of our prioritized needs so
 
00:27:52.549 --> 00:27:52.559 align:start position:0%
we still believe that it's something
 
00:27:54.310 --> 00:27:54.320 align:start position:0%
that's important to
 
00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:56.080 align:start position:0%
the agency it's important to the state
 
00:27:57.909 --> 00:27:57.919 align:start position:0%
and as i often like to point out
 
00:28:00.310 --> 00:28:00.320 align:start position:0%
it will save many years of time for our
 
00:28:02.070 --> 00:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
school district it will improve our
 
00:28:03.269 --> 00:28:03.279 align:start position:0%
ability to
 
00:28:05.350 --> 00:28:05.360 align:start position:0%
get you good and timely information and
 
00:28:07.029 --> 00:28:07.039 align:start position:0%
it will improve data security for our
 
00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:07.990 align:start position:0%
it will improve data security for our
students

00:28:07.990 --> 00:28:08.000 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:28:09.750 --> 00:28:09.760 align:start position:0%
um so we think it's a good thing and
 
00:28:11.430 --> 00:28:11.440 align:start position:0%
that's why it's in our prioritized list
 
00:28:13.029 --> 00:28:13.039 align:start position:0%
but it wasn't we weren't able to fit it
 
00:28:14.070 --> 00:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
into our
 
00:28:15.830 --> 00:28:15.840 align:start position:0%
the parameters of our budget that we had
 
00:28:19.110 --> 00:28:19.120 align:start position:0%
received from the governor's office
 
00:28:22.310 --> 00:28:22.320 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner um if madame
 
00:28:23.510 --> 00:28:23.520 align:start position:0%
champ if i may
 
00:28:26.950 --> 00:28:26.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry absolutely please um caitlyn
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
um what does this mean to school
 
00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:31.269 align:start position:0%
um what does this mean to school
districts

00:28:31.269 --> 00:28:31.279 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:28:34.149 --> 00:28:34.159 align:start position:0%
um so it's a little background
 
00:28:34.159 --> 00:28:34.950 align:start position:0%
um so it's a little background
information

00:28:34.950 --> 00:28:34.960 align:start position:0%
information
 
00:28:37.830 --> 00:28:37.840 align:start position:0%
um so our current system it's called i4c
 
00:28:39.590 --> 00:28:39.600 align:start position:0%
it's a proprietary software to the state
 
00:28:40.549 --> 00:28:40.559 align:start position:0%
of new hampshire
 
00:28:42.230 --> 00:28:42.240 align:start position:0%
um it was developed i believe maybe when
 
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:43.840 align:start position:0%
you were at the department or
 
00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:47.120 align:start position:0%
even prior it was 2001 and so 20 years
 
00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:47.669 align:start position:0%
even prior it was 2001 and so 20 years
ago

00:28:47.669 --> 00:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
ago
 
00:28:49.669 --> 00:28:49.679 align:start position:0%
and when we first originally developed
 
00:28:51.430 --> 00:28:51.440 align:start position:0%
this software we were a leader in the
 
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:53.760 align:start position:0%
country as far as student data
 
00:28:56.789 --> 00:28:56.799 align:start position:0%
collection systems because it's an
 
00:28:57.990 --> 00:28:58.000 align:start position:0%
internally developed system
 
00:28:59.909 --> 00:28:59.919 align:start position:0%
there has not been a lot of continuing
 
00:29:01.510 --> 00:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
operations costs so that's
 
00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:04.080 align:start position:0%
obviously a bonus for the state um but
 
00:29:05.269 --> 00:29:05.279 align:start position:0%
now we are
 
00:29:07.909 --> 00:29:07.919 align:start position:0%
here um 20 years later and there's a lot
 
00:29:10.230 --> 00:29:10.240 align:start position:0%
better systems that are available
 
00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:11.440 align:start position:0%
that the state of new hampshire really
 
00:29:13.430 --> 00:29:13.440 align:start position:0%
should be taking advantage of many of
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
the school districts across the state
 
00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:15.750 align:start position:0%
the school districts across the state
have

00:29:15.750 --> 00:29:15.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:29:17.430 --> 00:29:17.440 align:start position:0%
gone on their own and invested in
 
00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:19.520 align:start position:0%
student information systems
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
and then they would be if the state of
 
00:29:23.990 --> 00:29:24.000 align:start position:0%
new hampshire had a better system
 
00:29:25.430 --> 00:29:25.440 align:start position:0%
available be able to
 
00:29:28.149 --> 00:29:28.159 align:start position:0%
integrate automatically into our system
 
00:29:28.950 --> 00:29:28.960 align:start position:0%
and be able to
 
00:29:31.350 --> 00:29:31.360 align:start position:0%
report information to us without having
 
00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:32.960 align:start position:0%
to do a lot of the manual work that
 
00:29:35.029 --> 00:29:35.039 align:start position:0%
school districts are having to do now
 
00:29:37.669 --> 00:29:37.679 align:start position:0%
so right now for school to say if you
 
00:29:39.669 --> 00:29:39.679 align:start position:0%
were to have a new collection
 
00:29:42.230 --> 00:29:42.240 align:start position:0%
for school so say you want to know all
 
00:29:44.310 --> 00:29:44.320 align:start position:0%
the kids that have blue eyes for example
 
00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:45.360 align:start position:0%
in the schools
 
00:29:47.590 --> 00:29:47.600 align:start position:0%
the department of education would have
 
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
to contract with a vendor to modify our
 
00:29:49.760 --> 00:29:51.190 align:start position:0%
to contract with a vendor to modify our
system

00:29:51.190 --> 00:29:51.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:29:53.190 --> 00:29:53.200 align:start position:0%
train then provide training to school
 
00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.269 align:start position:0%
train then provide training to school
districts

00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:29:57.350 --> 00:29:57.360 align:start position:0%
then have the school districts have
 
00:29:59.269 --> 00:29:59.279 align:start position:0%
their own internal reports developed
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
download those upload them to our system
 
00:30:03.750 --> 00:30:03.760 align:start position:0%
and then spend a lot of time validating
 
00:30:05.269 --> 00:30:05.279 align:start position:0%
the data across the different school
 
00:30:05.279 --> 00:30:06.470 align:start position:0%
the data across the different school
districts

00:30:06.470 --> 00:30:06.480 align:start position:0%
districts
 
00:30:08.310 --> 00:30:08.320 align:start position:0%
if we had better systems at the state
 
00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:10.320 align:start position:0%
level all of that could be automated and
 
00:30:12.070 --> 00:30:12.080 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't need the excess staff time
 
00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:13.200 align:start position:0%
at the school districts nor the
 
00:30:14.710 --> 00:30:14.720 align:start position:0%
department of education staff time
 
00:30:15.830 --> 00:30:15.840 align:start position:0%
that's spent
 
00:30:18.389 --> 00:30:18.399 align:start position:0%
which would mean not only less time but
 
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:20.000 align:start position:0%
it would mean a higher quality of data
 
00:30:21.590 --> 00:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
being reported automatically to the
 
00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.190 align:start position:0%
being reported automatically to the
state

00:30:23.190 --> 00:30:23.200 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:30:24.710 --> 00:30:24.720 align:start position:0%
and i will just point out as well like
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
this is my third attempt at this one
 
00:30:28.149 --> 00:30:28.159 align:start position:0%
because i do think
 
00:30:29.269 --> 00:30:29.279 align:start position:0%
again it's just going to make
 
00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:31.200 align:start position:0%
everybody's lives easier
 
00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:33.679 align:start position:0%
and uh and if you imagine i didn't
 
00:30:34.389 --> 00:30:34.399 align:start position:0%
actually remember
 
00:30:35.750 --> 00:30:35.760 align:start position:0%
came in that the other system was
 
00:30:37.750 --> 00:30:37.760 align:start position:0%
developed back in like 2001.
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
i mean in tech talk that's a long time
 
00:30:40.320 --> 00:30:46.950 align:start position:0%
i mean in tech talk that's a long time
ago

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:46.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:50.630 --> 00:30:50.640 align:start position:0%
so are you telling me the
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
where's the number um
 
00:31:04.710 --> 00:31:04.720 align:start position:0%
it's line 38 on page 1209 prioritize
 
00:31:06.549 --> 00:31:06.559 align:start position:0%
needs item that they are discussing
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
okay so you're saying that this
 
00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.789 align:start position:0%
okay so you're saying that this
uh

00:31:12.789 --> 00:31:12.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:16.870 --> 00:31:16.880 align:start position:0%
change hands the figure of 401
 
00:31:18.789 --> 00:31:18.799 align:start position:0%
you said you've applied for a federal
 
00:31:18.799 --> 00:31:20.230 align:start position:0%
you said you've applied for a federal
grant

00:31:20.230 --> 00:31:20.240 align:start position:0%
grant
 
00:31:23.669 --> 00:31:23.679 align:start position:0%
to take care of the purchase
 
00:31:27.269 --> 00:31:27.279 align:start position:0%
of the software yes so
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
and then the 401 would be
 
00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:35.360 align:start position:0%
for licensing and
 
00:31:38.389 --> 00:31:38.399 align:start position:0%
whatever else is that correct no so
 
00:31:40.310 --> 00:31:40.320 align:start position:0%
um at the current levels that you're
 
00:31:41.669 --> 00:31:41.679 align:start position:0%
seeing right there the 401
 
00:31:43.750 --> 00:31:43.760 align:start position:0%
that does not include operating a new
 
00:31:45.350 --> 00:31:45.360 align:start position:0%
system that is just operating our
 
00:31:47.269 --> 00:31:47.279 align:start position:0%
current systems when we need to contract
 
00:31:48.789 --> 00:31:48.799 align:start position:0%
out for a vendor
 
00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:50.480 align:start position:0%
for some of our other current systems
 
00:31:52.230 --> 00:31:52.240 align:start position:0%
that we have that are up and going
 
00:31:55.110 --> 00:31:55.120 align:start position:0%
um in our prioritized needs budget we do
 
00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:57.760 align:start position:0%
not have the operating expenses
 
00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:00.880 align:start position:0%
the what in the past um
 
00:32:03.750 --> 00:32:03.760 align:start position:0%
you have seen a similar request in the
 
00:32:05.430 --> 00:32:05.440 align:start position:0%
capital budget as to our operating
 
00:32:07.029 --> 00:32:07.039 align:start position:0%
budget for an additional two million
 
00:32:07.039 --> 00:32:07.590 align:start position:0%
budget for an additional two million
dollars

00:32:07.590 --> 00:32:07.600 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:32:09.190 --> 00:32:09.200 align:start position:0%
so that would be the initial purchase
 
00:32:10.950 --> 00:32:10.960 align:start position:0%
and then this line right here that you
 
00:32:13.269 --> 00:32:13.279 align:start position:0%
see is the ongoing operations of the
 
00:32:17.110 --> 00:32:17.120 align:start position:0%
additional 1.5 million dollars um so
 
00:32:18.789 --> 00:32:18.799 align:start position:0%
if you look in our capital budget we
 
00:32:20.389 --> 00:32:20.399 align:start position:0%
don't have a request for the two million
 
00:32:21.909 --> 00:32:21.919 align:start position:0%
dollars in the capital budget because we
 
00:32:23.509 --> 00:32:23.519 align:start position:0%
have been successful in obtaining
 
00:32:25.269 --> 00:32:25.279 align:start position:0%
federal money to the for the initial
 
00:32:25.279 --> 00:32:26.149 align:start position:0%
federal money to the for the initial
purchase

00:32:26.149 --> 00:32:26.159 align:start position:0%
purchase
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
um but we do not have the ongoing
 
00:32:30.070 --> 00:32:30.080 align:start position:0%
operating costs covered
 
00:32:33.269 --> 00:32:33.279 align:start position:0%
and how much is that it's about we
 
00:32:35.190 --> 00:32:35.200 align:start position:0%
estimate it to be about 1.5 million
 
00:32:37.590 --> 00:32:37.600 align:start position:0%
dollars a year um it can vary
 
00:32:39.909 --> 00:32:39.919 align:start position:0%
um we're going to have hopefully results
 
00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
back from our rfp shortly
 
00:32:45.029 --> 00:32:45.039 align:start position:0%
and the the part that is kind of up in
 
00:32:46.950 --> 00:32:46.960 align:start position:0%
the air is how many school districts
 
00:32:48.710 --> 00:32:48.720 align:start position:0%
choose to use the state system because
 
00:32:50.310 --> 00:32:50.320 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we're hoping to
 
00:32:51.509 --> 00:32:51.519 align:start position:0%
be able to do
 
00:32:53.029 --> 00:32:53.039 align:start position:0%
is offer the school districts the
 
00:32:55.350 --> 00:32:55.360 align:start position:0%
ability to use the state system at a
 
00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
reduced or
 
00:32:59.269 --> 00:32:59.279 align:start position:0%
zero cost to the school districts um
 
00:33:00.870 --> 00:33:00.880 align:start position:0%
and then that would give us some
 
00:33:02.710 --> 00:33:02.720 align:start position:0%
purchasing power and obviously save some
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
money for the by the school districts
 
00:33:06.789 --> 00:33:06.799 align:start position:0%
so that is kind of one of the up in the
 
00:33:06.799 --> 00:33:07.909 align:start position:0%
so that is kind of one of the up in the
air

00:33:07.909 --> 00:33:07.919 align:start position:0%
air
 
00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:10.240 align:start position:0%
type things about really figuring out
 
00:33:12.710 --> 00:33:12.720 align:start position:0%
what the cost would be right now
 
00:33:14.149 --> 00:33:14.159 align:start position:0%
and i guess refund burger one of the
 
00:33:15.830 --> 00:33:15.840 align:start position:0%
things along that line too and caitlin i
 
00:33:17.750 --> 00:33:17.760 align:start position:0%
don't recall the actual per pupil
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
amounts but
 
00:33:20.149 --> 00:33:20.159 align:start position:0%
for example if we were to have a
 
00:33:22.310 --> 00:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
statewide system a typical district may
 
00:33:23.269 --> 00:33:23.279 align:start position:0%
be paying
 
00:33:26.149 --> 00:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
you know upwards of 15 ahead per kid to
 
00:33:27.509 --> 00:33:27.519 align:start position:0%
be able to use a
 
00:33:28.950 --> 00:33:28.960 align:start position:0%
you know if they buy their own license
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
but if we were to do a consolidated
 
00:33:30.399 --> 00:33:31.190 align:start position:0%
but if we were to do a consolidated
system

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:31.200 align:start position:0%
system
 
00:33:32.630 --> 00:33:32.640 align:start position:0%
then we might be able to get it for as
 
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:34.240 align:start position:0%
much as eight dollars so
 
00:33:37.509 --> 00:33:37.519 align:start position:0%
while it is true that we would be paying
 
00:33:37.519 --> 00:33:38.789 align:start position:0%
while it is true that we would be paying
for

00:33:38.789 --> 00:33:38.799 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:33:41.990 --> 00:33:42.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me we would be paying for those
 
00:33:43.590 --> 00:33:43.600 align:start position:0%
license costs at the state we would
 
00:33:45.909 --> 00:33:45.919 align:start position:0%
actually save the education system
 
00:33:48.549 --> 00:33:48.559 align:start position:0%
you know more than you know the cost of
 
00:33:54.310 --> 00:33:54.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.350 --> 00:33:57.360 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative heath
 
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:04.320 align:start position:0%
representative murray thank you
 
00:34:06.230 --> 00:34:06.240 align:start position:0%
um i thought i was following along and
 
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:08.000 align:start position:0%
then i got confused again
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:13.599 align:start position:0%
you haven't purchased this new software
 
00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:15.190 align:start position:0%
you haven't purchased this new software
yet

00:34:15.190 --> 00:34:15.200 align:start position:0%
yet
 
00:34:18.069 --> 00:34:18.079 align:start position:0%
and you don't have when you say maintain
 
00:34:20.149 --> 00:34:20.159 align:start position:0%
is that actually um
 
00:34:21.589 --> 00:34:21.599 align:start position:0%
what you need in order to use the
 
00:34:23.909 --> 00:34:23.919 align:start position:0%
software or is it what you need in order
 
00:34:25.109 --> 00:34:25.119 align:start position:0%
to continually main
 
00:34:26.950 --> 00:34:26.960 align:start position:0%
upgrade and maintain the software going
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
forward so is it
 
00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:30.399 align:start position:0%
maintained in terms of using it now or
 
00:34:32.629 --> 00:34:32.639 align:start position:0%
maintained going forward with upgrades
 
00:34:34.710 --> 00:34:34.720 align:start position:0%
um so the two million dollars that we
 
00:34:35.990 --> 00:34:36.000 align:start position:0%
received federal money that's the
 
00:34:37.909 --> 00:34:37.919 align:start position:0%
initial purchase that's installation on
 
00:34:39.510 --> 00:34:39.520 align:start position:0%
our systems that's installation on
 
00:34:40.950 --> 00:34:40.960 align:start position:0%
school district systems and the various
 
00:34:42.310 --> 00:34:42.320 align:start position:0%
professional development
 
00:34:44.230 --> 00:34:44.240 align:start position:0%
that comes on training the various
 
00:34:45.829 --> 00:34:45.839 align:start position:0%
schools to use the system
 
00:34:47.829 --> 00:34:47.839 align:start position:0%
the 1.5 that we would need would be the
 
00:34:49.349 --> 00:34:49.359 align:start position:0%
ongoing software
 
00:34:51.669 --> 00:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
licensing cost to continue using our
 
00:34:51.679 --> 00:34:53.030 align:start position:0%
licensing cost to continue using our
systems

00:34:53.030 --> 00:34:53.040 align:start position:0%
systems
 
00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:55.200 align:start position:0%
that we hope to depend depending on the
 
00:34:57.349 --> 00:34:57.359 align:start position:0%
vendor would cover things
 
00:34:59.190 --> 00:34:59.200 align:start position:0%
like when the legislature proposes new
 
00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.710 align:start position:0%
like when the legislature proposes new
legislation

00:35:00.710 --> 00:35:00.720 align:start position:0%
legislation
 
00:35:03.109 --> 00:35:03.119 align:start position:0%
the the software would likely come with
 
00:35:04.069 --> 00:35:04.079 align:start position:0%
maintenance agreements
 
00:35:06.150 --> 00:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
that they are automatically including
 
00:35:08.150 --> 00:35:08.160 align:start position:0%
have to include those new reports at no
 
00:35:09.190 --> 00:35:09.200 align:start position:0%
additional costs
 
00:35:11.030 --> 00:35:11.040 align:start position:0%
the school districts have those types of
 
00:35:13.670 --> 00:35:13.680 align:start position:0%
um deals in their current contracts and
 
00:35:15.109 --> 00:35:15.119 align:start position:0%
we would hopefully have that too
 
00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:17.520 align:start position:0%
so it would be the ongoing operations
 
00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:18.960 align:start position:0%
updating of the system everything should
 
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:20.960 align:start position:0%
be included in that licensing phase
 
00:35:23.430 --> 00:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
so federally you have the grant funds
 
00:35:24.790 --> 00:35:24.800 align:start position:0%
for the software
 
00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:26.960 align:start position:0%
and to purchase use the software you
 
00:35:29.109 --> 00:35:29.119 align:start position:0%
need us to provide money to use it yes
 
00:35:30.950 --> 00:35:30.960 align:start position:0%
exactly it'd be tough to get it and not
 
00:35:32.550 --> 00:35:32.560 align:start position:0%
be able to use it
 
00:35:33.990 --> 00:35:34.000 align:start position:0%
right you don't want to do that no
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%
that's not a good idea we need the whole
 
00:35:36.630 --> 00:35:36.640 align:start position:0%
package but
 
00:35:38.150 --> 00:35:38.160 align:start position:0%
i mean again we've asked for the package
 
00:35:39.349 --> 00:35:39.359 align:start position:0%
a couple of times and we didn't get it
 
00:35:41.109 --> 00:35:41.119 align:start position:0%
but we found this grant so we've applied
 
00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:42.800 align:start position:0%
for it anything we can do to
 
00:35:44.069 --> 00:35:44.079 align:start position:0%
you know offset the cost we will
 
00:35:51.030 --> 00:35:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:59.829 --> 00:35:59.839 align:start position:0%
okay next
 
00:36:03.030 --> 00:36:03.040 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that uh
 
00:36:06.550 --> 00:36:06.560 align:start position:0%
people want to uh okay
 
00:36:09.109 --> 00:36:09.119 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath you have
 
00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:10.069 align:start position:0%
uh representative heath you have
actually

00:36:10.069 --> 00:36:10.079 align:start position:0%
actually
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
covered all of my questions so so far
 
00:36:16.790 --> 00:36:16.800 align:start position:0%
so good on you um my question
 
00:36:19.349 --> 00:36:19.359 align:start position:0%
is about thank you madam chair and thank
 
00:36:20.310 --> 00:36:20.320 align:start position:0%
you commissioner
 
00:36:22.390 --> 00:36:22.400 align:start position:0%
um this is my budget that i know the
 
00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.670 align:start position:0%
um this is my budget that i know the
best

00:36:23.670 --> 00:36:23.680 align:start position:0%
best
 
00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440 align:start position:0%
um terms you have seven positions that
 
00:36:28.950 --> 00:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
you're requesting
 
00:36:32.150 --> 00:36:32.160 align:start position:0%
um could you describe those positions
 
00:36:35.430 --> 00:36:35.440 align:start position:0%
and the purpose of each um and
 
00:36:39.190 --> 00:36:39.200 align:start position:0%
the long range uh look at um
 
00:36:41.990 --> 00:36:42.000 align:start position:0%
how what the potential is for those
 
00:36:43.589 --> 00:36:43.599 align:start position:0%
continued funding
 
00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:46.640 align:start position:0%
uh source yeah so there's the seven
 
00:36:48.230 --> 00:36:48.240 align:start position:0%
positions are comprised of two
 
00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:49.430 align:start position:0%
positions are comprised of two
categories

00:36:49.430 --> 00:36:49.440 align:start position:0%
categories
 
00:36:53.670 --> 00:36:53.680 align:start position:0%
um the first is five positions for the
 
00:36:56.790 --> 00:36:56.800 align:start position:0%
disability determination service dds
 
00:36:59.589 --> 00:36:59.599 align:start position:0%
and so these are positions that the
 
00:37:01.190 --> 00:37:01.200 align:start position:0%
social security administration has
 
00:37:01.200 --> 00:37:02.310 align:start position:0%
social security administration has
requested

00:37:02.310 --> 00:37:02.320 align:start position:0%
requested
 
00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:04.800 align:start position:0%
that we expand our capacity to do those
 
00:37:07.109 --> 00:37:07.119 align:start position:0%
to provide those services
 
00:37:09.430 --> 00:37:09.440 align:start position:0%
those positions would only be available
 
00:37:11.109 --> 00:37:11.119 align:start position:0%
to the extent that they are funded right
 
00:37:13.190 --> 00:37:13.200 align:start position:0%
if the federal funds go away
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
then those positions would also go away
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
the other two positions that we have
 
00:37:19.510 --> 00:37:19.520 align:start position:0%
is we have two charter school funded
 
00:37:19.520 --> 00:37:20.550 align:start position:0%
is we have two charter school funded
positions

00:37:20.550 --> 00:37:20.560 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:22.160 align:start position:0%
and these also come to us through a
 
00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:23.680 align:start position:0%
federal grant so the
 
00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:25.680 align:start position:0%
uh 46 million dollar charter school
 
00:37:26.790 --> 00:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
grant that we received
 
00:37:28.630 --> 00:37:28.640 align:start position:0%
the grant application included two
 
00:37:31.510 --> 00:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
positions in it to administer that grant
 
00:37:33.990 --> 00:37:34.000 align:start position:0%
and so these are included in that and
 
00:37:36.950 --> 00:37:36.960 align:start position:0%
similar to the dds work if that grant
 
00:37:38.630 --> 00:37:38.640 align:start position:0%
goes away for some reason then these
 
00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
positions would also go away
 
00:37:42.950 --> 00:37:42.960 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner if i may madam
 
00:37:44.310 --> 00:37:44.320 align:start position:0%
chair one more
 
00:37:46.870 --> 00:37:46.880 align:start position:0%
absolutely in terms of those two
 
00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:47.589 align:start position:0%
absolutely in terms of those two
positions

00:37:47.589 --> 00:37:47.599 align:start position:0%
positions
 
00:37:50.150 --> 00:37:50.160 align:start position:0%
um one of the things that when i was at
 
00:37:52.069 --> 00:37:52.079 align:start position:0%
the department many years ago
 
00:37:55.270 --> 00:37:55.280 align:start position:0%
we were able to do some reviews and
 
00:37:59.190 --> 00:37:59.200 align:start position:0%
um oversight for the charter schools
 
00:38:02.550 --> 00:38:02.560 align:start position:0%
what is going to be the and then funding
 
00:38:05.589 --> 00:38:05.599 align:start position:0%
was eliminated and and there was really
 
00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:08.640 align:start position:0%
not a lot of oversight um because
 
00:38:10.470 --> 00:38:10.480 align:start position:0%
of the grant that you got and the
 
00:38:12.470 --> 00:38:12.480 align:start position:0%
increase in numbers of charters
 
00:38:15.349 --> 00:38:15.359 align:start position:0%
what kind of oversight do you see
 
00:38:15.359 --> 00:38:16.470 align:start position:0%
what kind of oversight do you see
happening

00:38:16.470 --> 00:38:16.480 align:start position:0%
happening
 
00:38:18.950 --> 00:38:18.960 align:start position:0%
as a result of all these new positions
 
00:38:19.990 --> 00:38:20.000 align:start position:0%
yep so well
 
00:38:22.310 --> 00:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
so certainly there's two aspects of that
 
00:38:23.750 --> 00:38:23.760 align:start position:0%
so these two charter school positions
 
00:38:25.109 --> 00:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
are written into the grant
 
00:38:27.670 --> 00:38:27.680 align:start position:0%
that are really designed around this
 
00:38:29.430 --> 00:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
this is a startup grant so these are
 
00:38:30.870 --> 00:38:30.880 align:start position:0%
positions that will be working with the
 
00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:31.589 align:start position:0%
positions that will be working with the
schools

00:38:31.589 --> 00:38:31.599 align:start position:0%
schools
 
00:38:34.069 --> 00:38:34.079 align:start position:0%
to be able to get going for ongoing
 
00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
schools that are either doing a
 
00:38:37.109 --> 00:38:37.119 align:start position:0%
replication or an expansion grant they
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
would support them
 
00:38:40.390 --> 00:38:40.400 align:start position:0%
these positions another aspect of the
 
00:38:41.750 --> 00:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
grant is what's referred to as best
 
00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:42.710 align:start position:0%
grant is what's referred to as best
practices

00:38:42.710 --> 00:38:42.720 align:start position:0%
practices
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
so they would have responsibility to
 
00:38:47.190 --> 00:38:47.200 align:start position:0%
propagate those best practices
 
00:38:49.349 --> 00:38:49.359 align:start position:0%
in all of our schools whether those be
 
00:38:50.790 --> 00:38:50.800 align:start position:0%
charter schools or traditional public
 
00:38:52.069 --> 00:38:52.079 align:start position:0%
schools to make sure that
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
that information gets out these would
 
00:38:55.589 --> 00:38:55.599 align:start position:0%
not be specific
 
00:38:58.470 --> 00:38:58.480 align:start position:0%
monitoring types of positions we do have
 
00:38:59.990 --> 00:39:00.000 align:start position:0%
and over the last couple of years
 
00:39:02.870 --> 00:39:02.880 align:start position:0%
have been putting in place monitoring
 
00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.069 align:start position:0%
have been putting in place monitoring
processes

00:39:04.069 --> 00:39:04.079 align:start position:0%
processes
 
00:39:06.230 --> 00:39:06.240 align:start position:0%
so for example also within caitlin's
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
bureau she has a
 
00:39:09.589 --> 00:39:09.599 align:start position:0%
a bureau of compliance that does
 
00:39:11.270 --> 00:39:11.280 align:start position:0%
compliance monitoring of
 
00:39:14.550 --> 00:39:14.560 align:start position:0%
our grantees both all of our schools
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
um and and looks at those and that
 
00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:17.910 align:start position:0%
um and and looks at those and that
program

00:39:17.910 --> 00:39:17.920 align:start position:0%
program
 
00:39:19.589 --> 00:39:19.599 align:start position:0%
you know has been stood up for probably
 
00:39:21.430 --> 00:39:21.440 align:start position:0%
about 18 months now can you correct me
 
00:39:22.470 --> 00:39:22.480 align:start position:0%
if i'm wrong
 
00:39:25.829 --> 00:39:25.839 align:start position:0%
um and so we have been executing against
 
00:39:27.030 --> 00:39:27.040 align:start position:0%
that and it has been
 
00:39:28.790 --> 00:39:28.800 align:start position:0%
effective in terms of helping to make
 
00:39:30.790 --> 00:39:30.800 align:start position:0%
sure that we have
 
00:39:32.630 --> 00:39:32.640 align:start position:0%
federal compliance like compliance with
 
00:39:34.150 --> 00:39:34.160 align:start position:0%
all the federal grants
 
00:39:37.270 --> 00:39:37.280 align:start position:0%
and then as well we are
 
00:39:39.750 --> 00:39:39.760 align:start position:0%
now having our other compliance which is
 
00:39:41.589 --> 00:39:41.599 align:start position:0%
accountability compliance is the way to
 
00:39:41.599 --> 00:39:41.990 align:start position:0%
accountability compliance is the way to
describe

00:39:41.990 --> 00:39:42.000 align:start position:0%
describe
 
00:39:43.270 --> 00:39:43.280 align:start position:0%
it which means that we've got schools
 
00:39:45.349 --> 00:39:45.359 align:start position:0%
that are complying with the state
 
00:39:48.710 --> 00:39:48.720 align:start position:0%
educational you know regulations um
 
00:39:50.630 --> 00:39:50.640 align:start position:0%
and that work we actually have a
 
00:39:52.150 --> 00:39:52.160 align:start position:0%
position that we have hired it's been
 
00:39:54.069 --> 00:39:54.079 align:start position:0%
difficult to find somebody who has that
 
00:39:54.079 --> 00:39:54.950 align:start position:0%
difficult to find somebody who has that
position

00:39:54.950 --> 00:39:54.960 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:39:57.589 --> 00:39:57.599 align:start position:0%
we have an individual who is a uh i
 
00:39:58.950 --> 00:39:58.960 align:start position:0%
think they're a principal in the school
 
00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
right now will be coming to us
 
00:40:01.990 --> 00:40:02.000 align:start position:0%
at the end of this contract here and
 
00:40:04.309 --> 00:40:04.319 align:start position:0%
we'll be able to begin to do that work
 
00:40:07.030 --> 00:40:07.040 align:start position:0%
so uh we i feel like we have the
 
00:40:08.150 --> 00:40:08.160 align:start position:0%
compliance work
 
00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:10.400 align:start position:0%
um you know that is happening but in
 
00:40:11.750 --> 00:40:11.760 align:start position:0%
these two particular
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
uh funds are mostly tied to the grand
 
00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:15.990 align:start position:0%
uh funds are mostly tied to the grand
activity

00:40:15.990 --> 00:40:16.000 align:start position:0%
activity
 
00:40:18.470 --> 00:40:18.480 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner and um one more
 
00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:19.109 align:start position:0%
thank you commissioner and um one more
question

00:40:19.109 --> 00:40:19.119 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:40:22.710 --> 00:40:22.720 align:start position:0%
related to assessment of charges but
 
00:40:24.710 --> 00:40:24.720 align:start position:0%
also assessment of our public school
 
00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:25.510 align:start position:0%
also assessment of our public school
students

00:40:25.510 --> 00:40:25.520 align:start position:0%
students
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
what is the assessment methodology right
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
now please
 
00:40:31.430 --> 00:40:31.440 align:start position:0%
yep so caitlin do you want to weigh in
 
00:40:33.190 --> 00:40:33.200 align:start position:0%
on that or otherwise i can take it but
 
00:40:36.630 --> 00:40:36.640 align:start position:0%
yeah sure um so just like when you were
 
00:40:37.829 --> 00:40:37.839 align:start position:0%
in the department we had the k
 
00:40:39.030 --> 00:40:39.040 align:start position:0%
through or sorry the three through eight
 
00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:41.040 align:start position:0%
and eleven assessment in math
 
00:40:43.430 --> 00:40:43.440 align:start position:0%
english language arts and science and we
 
00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:44.800 align:start position:0%
still have that same assessment
 
00:40:47.750 --> 00:40:47.760 align:start position:0%
um in 2015 we switched from our new
 
00:40:49.030 --> 00:40:49.040 align:start position:0%
hampshire kneecap to the
 
00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:52.960 align:start position:0%
smarter balance assessment and in 2019
 
00:40:55.510 --> 00:40:55.520 align:start position:0%
or maybe 18 i believe 18. so we switched
 
00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:55.990 align:start position:0%
or maybe 18 i believe 18. so we switched
um

00:40:55.990 --> 00:40:56.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:40:58.870 --> 00:40:58.880 align:start position:0%
from smarter balance which was owned by
 
00:40:58.880 --> 00:40:59.670 align:start position:0%
from smarter balance which was owned by
air

00:40:59.670 --> 00:40:59.680 align:start position:0%
air
 
00:41:02.470 --> 00:41:02.480 align:start position:0%
um the national assessment consortium um
 
00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:03.270 align:start position:0%
um the national assessment consortium um
to

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:03.280 align:start position:0%
to
 
00:41:05.270 --> 00:41:05.280 align:start position:0%
new hampshire sas which is very similar
 
00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:07.760 align:start position:0%
owned by the same exact consultant
 
00:41:09.990 --> 00:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
assessment firm very similar to that
 
00:41:11.349 --> 00:41:11.359 align:start position:0%
it's just kind of a new hampshire
 
00:41:13.270 --> 00:41:13.280 align:start position:0%
specific attests whereas smarter balance
 
00:41:15.109 --> 00:41:15.119 align:start position:0%
was more of a name brand
 
00:41:17.349 --> 00:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
and so we continue to implement that
 
00:41:17.359 --> 00:41:18.390 align:start position:0%
and so we continue to implement that
assessment

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.400 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
00:41:20.550 --> 00:41:20.560 align:start position:0%
the assessment um we are you know
 
00:41:22.230 --> 00:41:22.240 align:start position:0%
working on exactly what that's going to
 
00:41:23.990 --> 00:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
look like given the pandemic and whatnot
 
00:41:24.630 --> 00:41:24.640 align:start position:0%
this year
 
00:41:26.710 --> 00:41:26.720 align:start position:0%
um and various changes that are being
 
00:41:28.790 --> 00:41:28.800 align:start position:0%
required and or allowed by the federal
 
00:41:30.950 --> 00:41:30.960 align:start position:0%
government but that's the the process
 
00:41:32.150 --> 00:41:32.160 align:start position:0%
that we continue to
 
00:41:34.390 --> 00:41:34.400 align:start position:0%
to use and we haven't really changed
 
00:41:35.589 --> 00:41:35.599 align:start position:0%
that at all
 
00:41:38.309 --> 00:41:38.319 align:start position:0%
as far as our general assessments so and
 
00:41:39.910 --> 00:41:39.920 align:start position:0%
the charter schools are required to take
 
00:41:41.670 --> 00:41:41.680 align:start position:0%
the exact same assessment that all of
 
00:41:42.950 --> 00:41:42.960 align:start position:0%
our public schools in the state of new
 
00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:43.430 align:start position:0%
our public schools in the state of new
hampshire

00:41:43.430 --> 00:41:43.440 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
00:41:45.670 --> 00:41:45.680 align:start position:0%
are required to take great thank you and
 
00:41:46.790 --> 00:41:46.800 align:start position:0%
the cost is still
 
00:41:50.150 --> 00:41:50.160 align:start position:0%
shared federal and state
 
00:41:53.190 --> 00:41:53.200 align:start position:0%
yeah yes thank you
 
00:41:54.870 --> 00:41:54.880 align:start position:0%
paid for entirely by the state though
 
00:41:56.230 --> 00:41:56.240 align:start position:0%
not the school district so school
 
00:41:57.829 --> 00:41:57.839 align:start position:0%
districts don't incur any costs
 
00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:01.920 align:start position:0%
relative to the assessment thank you
 
00:42:03.270 --> 00:42:03.280 align:start position:0%
representative petrie you have a
 
00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.550 align:start position:0%
representative petrie you have a
question

00:42:04.550 --> 00:42:04.560 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:42:07.589 --> 00:42:07.599 align:start position:0%
no i just uh like i planned uh i have to
 
00:42:08.390 --> 00:42:08.400 align:start position:0%
leave but
 
00:42:10.390 --> 00:42:10.400 align:start position:0%
i want to thank the education department
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
00:42:13.910 --> 00:42:13.920 align:start position:0%
efficiency and cost effectiveness of
 
00:42:15.030 --> 00:42:15.040 align:start position:0%
their program uh
 
00:42:18.630 --> 00:42:18.640 align:start position:0%
is really impressive thank you thank you
 
00:42:21.829 --> 00:42:21.839 align:start position:0%
thank you very much representative petry
 
00:42:25.910 --> 00:42:25.920 align:start position:0%
are there other questions from anyone
 
00:42:30.069 --> 00:42:30.079 align:start position:0%
besides me
 
00:42:33.430 --> 00:42:33.440 align:start position:0%
okay um let's go back to
 
00:42:39.510 --> 00:42:39.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:42:42.550 --> 00:42:42.560 align:start position:0%
i got my right thing here um
 
00:42:46.710 --> 00:42:46.720 align:start position:0%
you had indicated that you were going to
 
00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:47.190 align:start position:0%
you had indicated that you were going to
add

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:47.200 align:start position:0%
add
 
00:42:50.710 --> 00:42:50.720 align:start position:0%
a position in credentialing or you
 
00:42:52.150 --> 00:42:52.160 align:start position:0%
wanted to add
 
00:42:55.589 --> 00:42:55.599 align:start position:0%
a position in credent credentialing
 
00:42:58.870 --> 00:42:58.880 align:start position:0%
but yet when you explained
 
00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240 align:start position:0%
the jump from 287 to 294
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
you attributed all of that increase
 
00:43:11.109 --> 00:43:11.119 align:start position:0%
to federal programs
 
00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:14.160 align:start position:0%
so susan
 
00:43:16.230 --> 00:43:16.240 align:start position:0%
tell me where tell me what i'm missing
 
00:43:17.430 --> 00:43:17.440 align:start position:0%
here um
 
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:20.640 align:start position:0%
so the 287 to 294 is an increase of
 
00:43:22.710 --> 00:43:22.720 align:start position:0%
seven and that increase of seven
 
00:43:23.829 --> 00:43:23.839 align:start position:0%
includes the five
 
00:43:25.030 --> 00:43:25.040 align:start position:0%
social security disability
 
00:43:27.349 --> 00:43:27.359 align:start position:0%
administration and the two
 
00:43:30.309 --> 00:43:30.319 align:start position:0%
charter school physicians i'm now coming
 
00:43:32.309 --> 00:43:32.319 align:start position:0%
to you and saying
 
00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:35.680 align:start position:0%
by the way after i finish my budget i
 
00:43:38.150 --> 00:43:38.160 align:start position:0%
need another position for the bus driver
 
00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:39.349 align:start position:0%
need another position for the bus driver
credentialing

00:43:39.349 --> 00:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
00:43:42.630 --> 00:43:42.640 align:start position:0%
so there's this new law that went into
 
00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:43.920 align:start position:0%
effect in january
 
00:43:45.829 --> 00:43:45.839 align:start position:0%
and so then we went to dop to get the
 
00:43:45.839 --> 00:43:47.030 align:start position:0%
and so then we went to dop to get the
position

00:43:47.030 --> 00:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:43:49.589 --> 00:43:49.599 align:start position:0%
um and because what is going to happen
 
00:43:51.510 --> 00:43:51.520 align:start position:0%
is at the department of education
 
00:43:54.150 --> 00:43:54.160 align:start position:0%
we will now be running background checks
 
00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:54.630 align:start position:0%
we will now be running background checks
for

00:43:54.630 --> 00:43:54.640 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:43:57.670 --> 00:43:57.680 align:start position:0%
school bus drivers so it's really
 
00:43:59.829 --> 00:43:59.839 align:start position:0%
not seven it's eight including that one
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
but that one was kind of a late entry
 
00:44:03.109 --> 00:44:03.119 align:start position:0%
into the process and that's why you're
 
00:44:06.069 --> 00:44:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:07.920 align:start position:0%
okay i guess i i guess i must have
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
missed that conversation i apologize
 
00:44:12.790 --> 00:44:12.800 align:start position:0%
so that was that beginning conversation
 
00:44:14.470 --> 00:44:14.480 align:start position:0%
of one of those modifications that we
 
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:15.430 align:start position:0%
of one of those modifications that we
need

00:44:15.430 --> 00:44:15.440 align:start position:0%
need
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
like as you're working on the budget
 
00:44:19.829 --> 00:44:19.839 align:start position:0%
there were three things that we needed
 
00:44:22.069 --> 00:44:22.079 align:start position:0%
um that we think need to be added to the
 
00:44:23.990 --> 00:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
budget one is for that
 
00:44:26.230 --> 00:44:26.240 align:start position:0%
uh the bus driver the other is for the
 
00:44:28.390 --> 00:44:28.400 align:start position:0%
transfer of the one position from one
 
00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.030 align:start position:0%
transfer of the one position from one
bureau

00:44:29.030 --> 00:44:29.040 align:start position:0%
bureau
 
00:44:31.190 --> 00:44:31.200 align:start position:0%
to the bureau of instructional support
 
00:44:33.430 --> 00:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
and then the third is to be able to
 
00:44:35.910 --> 00:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
get appropriation associated with the
 
00:44:37.190 --> 00:44:37.200 align:start position:0%
promising futures
 
00:44:39.910 --> 00:44:39.920 align:start position:0%
grants and the purple star program and
 
00:44:41.030 --> 00:44:41.040 align:start position:0%
so those are all
 
00:44:44.790 --> 00:44:44.800 align:start position:0%
activities that took place post-budget
 
00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:47.440 align:start position:0%
submission and so i'm just saying like
 
00:44:48.950 --> 00:44:48.960 align:start position:0%
if we can add those now then that would
 
00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:49.190 align:start position:0%
if we can add those now then that would
be

00:44:49.190 --> 00:44:49.200 align:start position:0%
be
 
00:44:52.470 --> 00:44:52.480 align:start position:0%
helpful uh have you forwarded that
 
00:44:54.550 --> 00:44:54.560 align:start position:0%
information to mickey and i just missed
 
00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:55.510 align:start position:0%
information to mickey and i just missed
it

00:44:55.510 --> 00:44:55.520 align:start position:0%
it
 
00:44:58.230 --> 00:44:58.240 align:start position:0%
we did i think he has it okay so that
 
00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:58.710 align:start position:0%
we did i think he has it okay so that
was

00:44:58.710 --> 00:44:58.720 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:45:01.589 --> 00:45:01.599 align:start position:0%
mickey that was what you sent yesterday
 
00:45:01.599 --> 00:45:02.790 align:start position:0%
mickey that was what you sent yesterday
yep

00:45:02.790 --> 00:45:02.800 align:start position:0%
yep
 
00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:05.680 align:start position:0%
yeah okay okay i i looked at it quickly
 
00:45:05.680 --> 00:45:06.069 align:start position:0%
yeah okay okay i i looked at it quickly
but

00:45:06.069 --> 00:45:06.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:45:10.630 --> 00:45:10.640 align:start position:0%
um i didn't uh now i know i need to uh
 
00:45:13.750 --> 00:45:13.760 align:start position:0%
look at a little more and correct me if
 
00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:15.040 align:start position:0%
i'm around cami but i think the bus
 
00:45:16.390 --> 00:45:16.400 align:start position:0%
driver position is
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
it's gonna be other funds funded right
 
00:45:21.430 --> 00:45:21.440 align:start position:0%
in other words through the bureau of
 
00:45:21.440 --> 00:45:22.710 align:start position:0%
in other words through the bureau of
credentialing

00:45:22.710 --> 00:45:22.720 align:start position:0%
credentialing
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
um if that's germane
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
that is correct and and
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
for clarification in reality that
 
00:45:31.839 --> 00:45:32.870 align:start position:0%
for clarification in reality that
position

00:45:32.870 --> 00:45:32.880 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:45:36.470 --> 00:45:36.480 align:start position:0%
was approved january 1st so it
 
00:45:39.910 --> 00:45:39.920 align:start position:0%
technically is in our budget right now
 
00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:41.760 align:start position:0%
or it's not really in the budget but it
 
00:45:43.510 --> 00:45:43.520 align:start position:0%
is a position that is available to the
 
00:45:43.520 --> 00:45:44.829 align:start position:0%
is a position that is available to the
department

00:45:44.829 --> 00:45:44.839 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
today we just simply did not include it
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
in the credentialing budget that was
 
00:45:53.589 --> 00:45:53.599 align:start position:0%
submitted during the agency phase
 
00:45:55.829 --> 00:45:55.839 align:start position:0%
because we did not have it available to
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
us so that's why we provided you a new
 
00:45:59.829 --> 00:45:59.839 align:start position:0%
budget for fy
 
00:46:03.349 --> 00:46:03.359 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 for the credentialing budget
 
00:46:03.359 --> 00:46:04.390 align:start position:0%
22 and 23 for the credentialing budget
because

00:46:04.390 --> 00:46:04.400 align:start position:0%
because
 
00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:06.720 align:start position:0%
um the inclusion of that position
 
00:46:08.150 --> 00:46:08.160 align:start position:0%
actually changes a lot
 
00:46:12.950 --> 00:46:12.960 align:start position:0%
of the other classes in that account
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
so if you look on page 1226 you'll see
 
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:16.630 align:start position:0%
so if you look on page 1226 you'll see
the

00:46:16.630 --> 00:46:16.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:46:19.670 --> 00:46:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh credentialing accounting unit 9008 on
 
00:46:21.349 --> 00:46:21.359 align:start position:0%
page 1226
 
00:46:23.190 --> 00:46:23.200 align:start position:0%
and tammy perhaps you want to share your
 
00:46:24.950 --> 00:46:24.960 align:start position:0%
screen with the requested budget that
 
00:46:26.870 --> 00:46:26.880 align:start position:0%
you'd like to put in place of what is
 
00:46:28.309 --> 00:46:28.319 align:start position:0%
in the governor's recommended budget
 
00:46:29.990 --> 00:46:30.000 align:start position:0%
just so the committee will kind of
 
00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:40.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:40.839 --> 00:46:49.430 align:start position:0%
 
here

00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:54.550 --> 00:46:54.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:57.670 --> 00:46:57.680 align:start position:0%
hit share yeah we can see it okay
 
00:47:00.790 --> 00:47:00.800 align:start position:0%
okay um so there were increases
 
00:47:04.150 --> 00:47:04.160 align:start position:0%
to not just the class 10 and the class
 
00:47:05.030 --> 00:47:05.040 align:start position:0%
60 but
 
00:47:08.150 --> 00:47:08.160 align:start position:0%
um we needed to increase things like um
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
rent and the telecommunications
 
00:47:14.790 --> 00:47:14.800 align:start position:0%
and um we needed to increase our
 
00:47:17.109 --> 00:47:17.119 align:start position:0%
contracts because the inclusion of this
 
00:47:17.119 --> 00:47:17.829 align:start position:0%
contracts because the inclusion of this
position

00:47:17.829 --> 00:47:17.839 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:47:20.549 --> 00:47:20.559 align:start position:0%
in the credentialing budget also means
 
00:47:21.589 --> 00:47:21.599 align:start position:0%
that we need to
 
00:47:24.950 --> 00:47:24.960 align:start position:0%
do some software changes to our software
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:32.230 --> 00:47:32.240 align:start position:0%
so essentially what what the
 
00:47:33.829 --> 00:47:33.839 align:start position:0%
department's looking to do
 
00:47:36.150 --> 00:47:36.160 align:start position:0%
is replace what you see in the
 
00:47:37.910 --> 00:47:37.920 align:start position:0%
governor's recommended budget on page
 
00:47:40.069 --> 00:47:40.079 align:start position:0%
1226 for that credentialing accounting
 
00:47:40.079 --> 00:47:40.950 align:start position:0%
1226 for that credentialing accounting
unit

00:47:40.950 --> 00:47:40.960 align:start position:0%
unit
 
00:47:43.589 --> 00:47:43.599 align:start position:0%
with the account uh with the budget that
 
00:47:45.430 --> 00:47:45.440 align:start position:0%
you see on the shared screen from tammy
 
00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.069 align:start position:0%
you see on the shared screen from tammy
so

00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:47:48.230 --> 00:47:48.240 align:start position:0%
and like the commissioner said these are
 
00:47:49.910 --> 00:47:49.920 align:start position:0%
not general funds this is a
 
00:47:51.990 --> 00:47:52.000 align:start position:0%
restricted revolving fund the
 
00:47:54.390 --> 00:47:54.400 align:start position:0%
credentialing fund that funds this
 
00:47:55.910 --> 00:47:55.920 align:start position:0%
accounting unit so there would be no
 
00:47:57.510 --> 00:47:57.520 align:start position:0%
impact on your
 
00:47:59.510 --> 00:47:59.520 align:start position:0%
general fund picture for the division to
 
00:48:02.230 --> 00:48:02.240 align:start position:0%
do this change
 
00:48:03.430 --> 00:48:03.440 align:start position:0%
representative murray you have a
 
00:48:05.829 --> 00:48:05.839 align:start position:0%
question yeah just so i'm following
 
00:48:07.829 --> 00:48:07.839 align:start position:0%
along so
 
00:48:12.150 --> 00:48:12.160 align:start position:0%
on 1227 you have the um
 
00:48:15.750 --> 00:48:15.760 align:start position:0%
total source of funds is 1725
 
00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:19.200 align:start position:0%
278 and that will change to two zero one
 
00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:19.589 align:start position:0%
278 and that will change to two zero one
two

00:48:19.589 --> 00:48:19.599 align:start position:0%
two
 
00:48:22.710 --> 00:48:22.720 align:start position:0%
zero four three all right is that right
 
00:48:26.230 --> 00:48:26.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:28.470 --> 00:48:28.480 align:start position:0%
now we have a uh i know we have a
 
00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
now we have a uh i know we have a
footnote

00:48:29.510 --> 00:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
footnote
 
00:48:33.670 --> 00:48:33.680 align:start position:0%
footnote i know we have a footnote here
 
00:48:34.549 --> 00:48:34.559 align:start position:0%
that says
 
00:48:37.589 --> 00:48:37.599 align:start position:0%
um you know these
 
00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:40.720 align:start position:0%
these monies need to stay within this do
 
00:48:41.990 --> 00:48:42.000 align:start position:0%
we know how much
 
00:48:45.510 --> 00:48:45.520 align:start position:0%
money is actually in this fund
 
00:48:49.030 --> 00:48:49.040 align:start position:0%
and can it absorb
 
00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:52.240 align:start position:0%
this new position without
 
00:48:56.069 --> 00:48:56.079 align:start position:0%
a corresponding
 
00:48:59.109 --> 00:48:59.119 align:start position:0%
increase to credentialing fees
 
00:49:02.870 --> 00:49:02.880 align:start position:0%
so ordinarily i might say yes
 
00:49:05.510 --> 00:49:05.520 align:start position:0%
representative except that what we did
 
00:49:05.520 --> 00:49:06.309 align:start position:0%
representative except that what we did
is

00:49:06.309 --> 00:49:06.319 align:start position:0%
is
 
00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:10.400 align:start position:0%
we reduced our educator licensure fees
 
00:49:12.710 --> 00:49:12.720 align:start position:0%
based on a model to bleed off any
 
00:49:14.390 --> 00:49:14.400 align:start position:0%
potential excess so
 
00:49:16.710 --> 00:49:16.720 align:start position:0%
if we don't fund this position then
 
00:49:18.230 --> 00:49:18.240 align:start position:0%
ultimately we would probably have to
 
00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:20.000 align:start position:0%
reverse some of that feed reduction that
 
00:49:22.150 --> 00:49:22.160 align:start position:0%
we've just provided to the educators
 
00:49:24.069 --> 00:49:24.079 align:start position:0%
uh because you probably can't before you
 
00:49:26.230 --> 00:49:26.240 align:start position:0%
vote like i can't reduce the fees and
 
00:49:27.910 --> 00:49:27.920 align:start position:0%
increase the cost simultaneously
 
00:49:30.549 --> 00:49:30.559 align:start position:0%
it would accelerate the bleed off of any
 
00:49:35.670 --> 00:49:35.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:40.390 --> 00:49:40.400 align:start position:0%
so did i just hear you say that
 
00:49:41.829 --> 00:49:41.839 align:start position:0%
that you had thought you were going to
 
00:49:44.150 --> 00:49:44.160 align:start position:0%
reduce the fees but with this new person
 
00:49:45.829 --> 00:49:45.839 align:start position:0%
you won't be able to
 
00:49:47.910 --> 00:49:47.920 align:start position:0%
no what i'm saying is i already did
 
00:49:50.470 --> 00:49:50.480 align:start position:0%
reduce the fees last spring
 
00:49:53.750 --> 00:49:53.760 align:start position:0%
and so that fee reduction because i had
 
00:49:55.589 --> 00:49:55.599 align:start position:0%
i was accumulating some funds in this
 
00:49:57.109 --> 00:49:57.119 align:start position:0%
account and this is
 
00:49:58.950 --> 00:49:58.960 align:start position:0%
again the teachers pay their fees and
 
00:50:00.390 --> 00:50:00.400 align:start position:0%
i'm only trying to
 
00:50:02.230 --> 00:50:02.240 align:start position:0%
charge them what it costs me so we
 
00:50:04.470 --> 00:50:04.480 align:start position:0%
reduced the fees in the spring
 
00:50:07.829 --> 00:50:07.839 align:start position:0%
then we got this bill that will result
 
00:50:09.190 --> 00:50:09.200 align:start position:0%
in an increased cost so
 
00:50:11.589 --> 00:50:11.599 align:start position:0%
i think it might be improving to
 
00:50:11.599 --> 00:50:12.390 align:start position:0%
i think it might be improving to
continue

00:50:12.390 --> 00:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
continue
 
00:50:14.549 --> 00:50:14.559 align:start position:0%
to have a fee reduction and an increase
 
00:50:16.230 --> 00:50:16.240 align:start position:0%
in cost so i think it's better to just
 
00:50:17.990 --> 00:50:18.000 align:start position:0%
leave the fee reduced than to
 
00:50:21.990 --> 00:50:22.000 align:start position:0%
have this added to the budget
 
00:50:24.950 --> 00:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
so if i understood what you said which
 
00:50:25.990 --> 00:50:26.000 align:start position:0%
obviously i didn't
 
00:50:31.030 --> 00:50:31.040 align:start position:0%
the first time you reduced the fees
 
00:50:33.589 --> 00:50:33.599 align:start position:0%
in last year yeah and you had been
 
00:50:36.390 --> 00:50:36.400 align:start position:0%
planning to reduce the fees again
 
00:50:38.710 --> 00:50:38.720 align:start position:0%
we were re-looking at those options okay
 
00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:39.430 align:start position:0%
we were re-looking at those options okay
okay

00:50:39.430 --> 00:50:39.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:50:43.109 --> 00:50:43.119 align:start position:0%
but because of your adding this position
 
00:50:45.990 --> 00:50:46.000 align:start position:0%
you won't reduce the fees this coming
 
00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.030 align:start position:0%
you won't reduce the fees this coming
year

00:50:47.030 --> 00:50:47.040 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:50:48.630 --> 00:50:48.640 align:start position:0%
um i don't think so we're just going to
 
00:50:50.710 --> 00:50:50.720 align:start position:0%
continue to look at it and see anytime
 
00:50:51.750 --> 00:50:51.760 align:start position:0%
that i can
 
00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:53.760 align:start position:0%
create the reduction i will but right
 
00:50:55.510 --> 00:50:55.520 align:start position:0%
now i don't think so
 
00:51:00.150 --> 00:51:00.160 align:start position:0%
okay so this is kind of a
 
00:51:04.069 --> 00:51:04.079 align:start position:0%
so in this area you've already
 
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:07.520 align:start position:0%
increased from 10
 
00:51:12.309 --> 00:51:12.319 align:start position:0%
to 11. and so now you're asking to go
 
00:51:16.870 --> 00:51:16.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:20.230 --> 00:51:20.240 align:start position:0%
positions this is on uh yeah
 
00:51:23.589 --> 00:51:23.599 align:start position:0%
you're on page uh 12 27. we're adding
 
00:51:23.599 --> 00:51:23.990 align:start position:0%
you're on page uh 12 27. we're adding
the

00:51:23.990 --> 00:51:24.000 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:51:26.790 --> 00:51:26.800 align:start position:0%
one additional uh position no because i
 
00:51:26.800 --> 00:51:27.109 align:start position:0%
one additional uh position no because i
think

00:51:27.109 --> 00:51:27.119 align:start position:0%
think
 
00:51:28.950 --> 00:51:28.960 align:start position:0%
cammy you said that i already have the
 
00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.309 align:start position:0%
cammy you said that i already have the
position

00:51:30.309 --> 00:51:30.319 align:start position:0%
position
 
00:51:32.309 --> 00:51:32.319 align:start position:0%
but i didn't go ahead and i'm gonna let
 
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:33.680 align:start position:0%
tammy describe that
 
00:51:34.710 --> 00:51:34.720 align:start position:0%
because it's kind of this weird thing
 
00:51:36.710 --> 00:51:36.720 align:start position:0%
there's like a doughnut haul you get the
 
00:51:38.230 --> 00:51:38.240 align:start position:0%
authorization but you don't actually
 
00:51:40.309 --> 00:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
have the dop authorization kind of thing
 
00:51:40.319 --> 00:51:41.190 align:start position:0%
have the dop authorization kind of thing
so

00:51:41.190 --> 00:51:41.200 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:51:44.870 --> 00:51:44.880 align:start position:0%
right i believe that she
 
00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:46.880 align:start position:0%
represented berger i believe you are
 
00:51:48.230 --> 00:51:48.240 align:start position:0%
correct we will go to
 
00:52:02.829 --> 00:52:02.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:02.839 --> 00:52:12.870 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:52:12.870 --> 00:52:12.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:52:16.390 --> 00:52:16.400 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much will and
 
00:52:19.750 --> 00:52:19.760 align:start position:0%
yeah you've got that for me someplace
 
00:52:22.790 --> 00:52:22.800 align:start position:0%
right and mickey has that yeah
 
00:52:24.790 --> 00:52:24.800 align:start position:0%
you've sent it you've sent it to me it's
 
00:52:26.870 --> 00:52:26.880 align:start position:0%
been sent to the the committee
 
00:52:28.870 --> 00:52:28.880 align:start position:0%
online too if the public is looking for
 
00:52:31.349 --> 00:52:31.359 align:start position:0%
this information
 
00:52:35.829 --> 00:52:35.839 align:start position:0%
okay all right sounds sounds good
 
00:52:39.349 --> 00:52:39.359 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
00:52:43.190 --> 00:52:43.200 align:start position:0%
from the group
 
00:52:46.790 --> 00:52:46.800 align:start position:0%
okay let me
 
00:52:50.150 --> 00:52:50.160 align:start position:0%
let me find my questions here
 
00:52:54.710 --> 00:52:54.720 align:start position:0%
um commissioner
 
00:52:58.790 --> 00:52:58.800 align:start position:0%
i guess that you are um have done
 
00:53:02.390 --> 00:53:02.400 align:start position:0%
a lot of rearranging of positions
 
00:53:06.309 --> 00:53:06.319 align:start position:0%
throughout the um the budget
 
00:53:09.030 --> 00:53:09.040 align:start position:0%
and i assume that that's because you're
 
00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:10.470 align:start position:0%
and i assume that that's because you're
doing

00:53:10.470 --> 00:53:10.480 align:start position:0%
doing
 
00:53:14.150 --> 00:53:14.160 align:start position:0%
a um
 
00:53:18.150 --> 00:53:18.160 align:start position:0%
and what do i want to call it um yeah
 
00:53:21.589 --> 00:53:21.599 align:start position:0%
a reorganization so i would say that
 
00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:23.200 align:start position:0%
there's a combination of
 
00:53:24.630 --> 00:53:24.640 align:start position:0%
stuff there's not a ton of the
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
reorganization but i think and tammy
 
00:53:27.750 --> 00:53:27.760 align:start position:0%
maybe you want to weigh in on this as
 
00:53:27.760 --> 00:53:28.470 align:start position:0%
maybe you want to weigh in on this as
well

00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:53:30.870 --> 00:53:30.880 align:start position:0%
we did create some new accounting unit
 
00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:32.960 align:start position:0%
type of control so that we had greater
 
00:53:35.109 --> 00:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
visibility and transparency into some of
 
00:53:38.150 --> 00:53:38.160 align:start position:0%
the activities that are going on
 
00:53:41.589 --> 00:53:41.599 align:start position:0%
yes yes so for example when caitlin was
 
00:53:41.599 --> 00:53:42.069 align:start position:0%
yes yes so for example when caitlin was
talking

00:53:42.069 --> 00:53:42.079 align:start position:0%
talking
 
00:53:45.430 --> 00:53:45.440 align:start position:0%
earlier during the reorg she we had
 
00:53:47.270 --> 00:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
the accounting units during the last
 
00:53:48.710 --> 00:53:48.720 align:start position:0%
budget and
 
00:53:52.309 --> 00:53:52.319 align:start position:0%
she inserted positions where she thought
 
00:53:54.069 --> 00:53:54.079 align:start position:0%
they were going to be but throughout the
 
00:53:55.510 --> 00:53:55.520 align:start position:0%
last two years
 
00:53:58.230 --> 00:53:58.240 align:start position:0%
it um some of the positions just needed
 
00:53:59.750 --> 00:53:59.760 align:start position:0%
to be moved they're still within
 
00:54:02.150 --> 00:54:02.160 align:start position:0%
her division but she just needed to move
 
00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:03.920 align:start position:0%
them into more appropriate accounting
 
00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:06.870 align:start position:0%
them into more appropriate accounting
units

00:54:06.870 --> 00:54:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:08.870 --> 00:54:08.880 align:start position:0%
it's no problem i just wanted to make
 
00:54:10.150 --> 00:54:10.160 align:start position:0%
sure that that's that's
 
00:54:12.390 --> 00:54:12.400 align:start position:0%
what it was all about uh representative
 
00:54:14.790 --> 00:54:14.800 align:start position:0%
murray you have a question
 
00:54:17.670 --> 00:54:17.680 align:start position:0%
i was wondering on 12 33 if those change
 
00:54:19.670 --> 00:54:19.680 align:start position:0%
of positions is the is an example of
 
00:54:21.270 --> 00:54:21.280 align:start position:0%
what you're talking about
 
00:54:23.190 --> 00:54:23.200 align:start position:0%
um it went from four positions to two
 
00:54:30.790 --> 00:54:30.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:32.950 --> 00:54:32.960 align:start position:0%
this is under instructional suppression
 
00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:33.910 align:start position:0%
this is under instructional suppression
where

00:54:33.910 --> 00:54:33.920 align:start position:0%
where
 
00:54:35.990 --> 00:54:36.000 align:start position:0%
was that an example of or did you
 
00:54:39.510 --> 00:54:39.520 align:start position:0%
actually lose those positions
 
00:54:42.150 --> 00:54:42.160 align:start position:0%
this is this is one of these positions
 
00:54:43.190 --> 00:54:43.200 align:start position:0%
that was moved
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
is the position that the commissioner is
 
00:54:45.359 --> 00:54:46.230 align:start position:0%
is the position that the commissioner is
requesting

00:54:46.230 --> 00:54:46.240 align:start position:0%
requesting
 
00:54:48.789 --> 00:54:48.799 align:start position:0%
it reinstated into this same exact
 
00:54:48.799 --> 00:54:49.670 align:start position:0%
it reinstated into this same exact
account

00:54:49.670 --> 00:54:49.680 align:start position:0%
account
 
00:54:51.829 --> 00:54:51.839 align:start position:0%
so instead of going from four down to
 
00:54:54.549 --> 00:54:54.559 align:start position:0%
two it would go from four down to
 
00:54:57.270 --> 00:54:57.280 align:start position:0%
three because we would move a position
 
00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:57.589 align:start position:0%
three because we would move a position
that

00:54:57.589 --> 00:54:57.599 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:54:59.990 --> 00:55:00.000 align:start position:0%
is in another accounting unit back into
 
00:55:01.270 --> 00:55:01.280 align:start position:0%
this accounting unit
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
so there were two positions that were
 
00:55:04.549 --> 00:55:04.559 align:start position:0%
lost but you're going to move one back
 
00:55:07.349 --> 00:55:07.359 align:start position:0%
from another accounting unit
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
so this will actually be three jimmy do
 
00:55:12.390 --> 00:55:12.400 align:start position:0%
you know what the other position is
 
00:55:14.710 --> 00:55:14.720 align:start position:0%
not off the top of my head i don't know
 
00:55:17.670 --> 00:55:17.680 align:start position:0%
i apologize also if you go to page 1254
 
00:55:20.630 --> 00:55:20.640 align:start position:0%
you'll see the other side of this
 
00:55:20.640 --> 00:55:23.990 align:start position:0%
you'll see the other side of this
conversation

00:55:23.990 --> 00:55:24.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:29.990 --> 00:55:30.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:32.630 --> 00:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
right the title 4b is where we removing
 
00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.270 align:start position:0%
right the title 4b is where we removing
that

00:55:33.270 --> 00:55:33.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:55:35.270 --> 00:55:35.280 align:start position:0%
aventfort position out of to be kind of
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
oversight of some of this stuff right
 
00:55:40.110 --> 00:55:40.120 align:start position:0%
nikki you're amazing
 
00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:43.750 align:start position:0%
nikki you're amazing
[Music]

00:55:43.750 --> 00:55:43.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:47.030 --> 00:55:47.040 align:start position:0%
that's why we have them here and we like
 
00:55:51.670 --> 00:55:51.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:54.470 --> 00:55:54.480 align:start position:0%
so so i guess i mean essentially we move
 
00:55:57.030 --> 00:55:57.040 align:start position:0%
stuff around to try to be
 
00:55:59.270 --> 00:55:59.280 align:start position:0%
efficient in terms of who's where make
 
00:56:01.270 --> 00:56:01.280 align:start position:0%
sure we have good accountability
 
00:56:03.349 --> 00:56:03.359 align:start position:0%
but then also just some of the the
 
00:56:05.030 --> 00:56:05.040 align:start position:0%
accounting unit stuff to make sure that
 
00:56:08.710 --> 00:56:08.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:12.549 --> 00:56:12.559 align:start position:0%
okay are there any other questions
 
00:56:15.349 --> 00:56:15.359 align:start position:0%
all right i do have a question on page
 
00:56:15.359 --> 00:56:17.910 align:start position:0%
all right i do have a question on page
1202

00:56:17.910 --> 00:56:17.920 align:start position:0%
1202
 
00:56:21.109 --> 00:56:21.119 align:start position:0%
um you're showing
 
00:56:24.150 --> 00:56:24.160 align:start position:0%
a office of the comm
 
00:56:26.549 --> 00:56:26.559 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner printing revolving
 
00:56:26.559 --> 00:56:28.829 align:start position:0%
deputy commissioner printing revolving
fund

00:56:28.829 --> 00:56:28.839 align:start position:0%
fund
 
00:56:31.670 --> 00:56:31.680 align:start position:0%
and the source of revenue is result
 
00:56:34.870 --> 00:56:34.880 align:start position:0%
revolve revolving funds
 
00:56:38.470 --> 00:56:38.480 align:start position:0%
now i understand that
 
00:56:41.430 --> 00:56:41.440 align:start position:0%
they're setting up a revolving fund in
 
00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:42.069 align:start position:0%
they're setting up a revolving fund in
bas

00:56:42.069 --> 00:56:42.079 align:start position:0%
bas
 
00:56:45.270 --> 00:56:45.280 align:start position:0%
for printing is this something
 
00:56:51.030 --> 00:56:51.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:53.190 --> 00:56:53.200 align:start position:0%
so this is our copier fund in our
 
00:56:55.430 --> 00:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
printing fund here at the department
 
00:56:57.910 --> 00:56:57.920 align:start position:0%
we i'm sorry jimmy you're not you're not
 
00:56:57.920 --> 00:56:58.950 align:start position:0%
we i'm sorry jimmy you're not you're not
clear

00:56:58.950 --> 00:56:58.960 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:57:00.870 --> 00:57:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'm not yeah your mic isn't working all
 
00:57:04.549 --> 00:57:04.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:07.829 --> 00:57:07.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:11.190 --> 00:57:11.200 align:start position:0%
yes yeah okay um
 
00:57:13.270 --> 00:57:13.280 align:start position:0%
that's our copier account here at the
 
00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:14.309 align:start position:0%
that's our copier account here at the
department

00:57:14.309 --> 00:57:14.319 align:start position:0%
department
 
00:57:17.589 --> 00:57:17.599 align:start position:0%
so we rent copiers we use this
 
00:57:20.710 --> 00:57:20.720 align:start position:0%
fund to um pay for the copiers and then
 
00:57:22.390 --> 00:57:22.400 align:start position:0%
we cross allocate from all of the
 
00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:23.349 align:start position:0%
we cross allocate from all of the
programs

00:57:23.349 --> 00:57:23.359 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:29.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:57:31.910 --> 00:57:31.920 align:start position:0%
okay that makes that makes sense to me
 
00:57:34.950 --> 00:57:34.960 align:start position:0%
this did not make sense because of
 
00:57:38.230 --> 00:57:38.240 align:start position:0%
what was said in um in the
 
00:57:57.349 --> 00:57:57.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:01.109 --> 00:58:01.119 align:start position:0%
i made notes here and uh don't worry
 
00:58:05.270 --> 00:58:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:08.710 --> 00:58:08.720 align:start position:0%
go through them okay
 
00:58:15.589 --> 00:58:15.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:18.390 --> 00:58:18.400 align:start position:0%
which is veteran education services
 
00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.470 align:start position:0%
which is veteran education services
state

00:58:20.470 --> 00:58:20.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:58:24.549 --> 00:58:24.559 align:start position:0%
and we have a um
 
00:58:28.630 --> 00:58:28.640 align:start position:0%
money from uh the feds
 
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:32.410 align:start position:0%
to support this so what are we doing
 
00:58:32.410 --> 00:58:33.829 align:start position:0%
to support this so what are we doing
[Music]

00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:58:37.270 --> 00:58:37.280 align:start position:0%
with the uh the state funds
 
00:58:40.710 --> 00:58:40.720 align:start position:0%
since this was not there in the last
 
00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:45.430 align:start position:0%
since this was not there in the last
budget

00:58:45.430 --> 00:58:45.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:58:46.950 --> 00:58:46.960 align:start position:0%
so tammy you can weigh in as well but i
 
00:58:48.309 --> 00:58:48.319 align:start position:0%
think it was in the last budget but this
 
00:58:50.069 --> 00:58:50.079 align:start position:0%
is one of those where we try to separate
 
00:58:51.589 --> 00:58:51.599 align:start position:0%
out so we could have clean accounting
 
00:58:53.349 --> 00:58:53.359 align:start position:0%
associated with it
 
00:58:55.910 --> 00:58:55.920 align:start position:0%
because we do run the veterans fund
 
00:58:57.349 --> 00:58:57.359 align:start position:0%
which is basically
 
00:59:01.750 --> 00:59:01.760 align:start position:0%
from this is the right accounting unit
 
00:59:05.589 --> 00:59:05.599 align:start position:0%
in the career schools where we
 
00:59:08.150 --> 00:59:08.160 align:start position:0%
you have to certify all of the programs
 
00:59:09.670 --> 00:59:09.680 align:start position:0%
associated with
 
00:59:13.510 --> 00:59:13.520 align:start position:0%
uh the education programs for veterans
 
00:59:16.710 --> 00:59:16.720 align:start position:0%
and we are funded for much of that work
 
00:59:19.349 --> 00:59:19.359 align:start position:0%
through federal funds but i don't think
 
00:59:20.549 --> 00:59:20.559 align:start position:0%
this is new is it
 
00:59:23.829 --> 00:59:23.839 align:start position:0%
tammy it is i don't know um
 
00:59:27.990 --> 00:59:28.000 align:start position:0%
it's on to be perfectly honest the
 
00:59:31.349 --> 00:59:31.359 align:start position:0%
federal government's not giving us
 
00:59:33.190 --> 00:59:33.200 align:start position:0%
funding sufficiency we carve down okay
 
00:59:35.109 --> 00:59:35.119 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:59:37.349 --> 00:59:37.359 align:start position:0%
um and because they're not giving us
 
00:59:38.470 --> 00:59:38.480 align:start position:0%
sufficient funds
 
00:59:42.390 --> 00:59:42.400 align:start position:0%
for the overhead um we put this in as a
 
00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:44.559 align:start position:0%
general funded request to help support
 
00:59:46.069 --> 00:59:46.079 align:start position:0%
that program
 
00:59:49.030 --> 00:59:49.040 align:start position:0%
in the various areas of like information
 
00:59:49.040 --> 00:59:50.309 align:start position:0%
in the various areas of like information
technology

00:59:50.309 --> 00:59:50.319 align:start position:0%
technology
 
00:59:53.750 --> 00:59:53.760 align:start position:0%
you know current expenses things
 
00:59:57.109 --> 00:59:57.119 align:start position:0%
that that the the veterans program uses
 
01:00:00.390 --> 01:00:00.400 align:start position:0%
a sliding scale for
 
01:00:03.430 --> 01:00:03.440 align:start position:0%
what they allow the department to charge
 
01:00:06.470 --> 01:00:06.480 align:start position:0%
for overhead cost
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
operating cost and it's not sufficient
 
01:00:09.359 --> 01:00:09.750 align:start position:0%
operating cost and it's not sufficient
to

01:00:09.750 --> 01:00:09.760 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:00:15.510 --> 01:00:15.520 align:start position:0%
support the program
 
01:00:18.710 --> 01:00:18.720 align:start position:0%
honestly it was either do this or
 
01:00:18.720 --> 01:00:21.990 align:start position:0%
honestly it was either do this or
um

01:00:21.990 --> 01:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:24.789 --> 01:00:24.799 align:start position:0%
we have gone back to the veterans um
 
01:00:24.799 --> 01:00:25.670 align:start position:0%
we have gone back to the veterans um
administration

01:00:25.670 --> 01:00:25.680 align:start position:0%
administration
 
01:00:27.030 --> 01:00:27.040 align:start position:0%
a couple of times telling them that
 
01:00:28.470 --> 01:00:28.480 align:start position:0%
there's not enough administrative
 
01:00:28.480 --> 01:00:29.430 align:start position:0%
there's not enough administrative
support

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:29.440 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:00:32.870 --> 01:00:32.880 align:start position:0%
to pay for our activities
 
01:00:35.670 --> 01:00:35.680 align:start position:0%
we have those efforts have not been met
 
01:00:35.680 --> 01:00:37.109 align:start position:0%
we have those efforts have not been met
positively

01:00:37.109 --> 01:00:37.119 align:start position:0%
positively
 
01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:38.720 align:start position:0%
they've not said that they would allow
 
01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:40.400 align:start position:0%
us to have any kind of an increased
 
01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:41.589 align:start position:0%
us to have any kind of an increased
funding

01:00:41.589 --> 01:00:41.599 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:00:43.430 --> 01:00:43.440 align:start position:0%
and i think the whole budget is only
 
01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:45.920 align:start position:0%
about 157 thousand families
 
01:00:48.549 --> 01:00:48.559 align:start position:0%
right and so then they give you a
 
01:00:50.150 --> 01:00:50.160 align:start position:0%
certain amount of administrative
 
01:00:52.390 --> 01:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
support that's just not enough to pay
 
01:00:54.950 --> 01:00:54.960 align:start position:0%
for the cost
 
01:00:57.109 --> 01:00:57.119 align:start position:0%
especially if you have staff who are in
 
01:00:58.549 --> 01:00:58.559 align:start position:0%
those positions
 
01:01:00.230 --> 01:01:00.240 align:start position:0%
i apologize for the way i'm losing my
 
01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:05.109 align:start position:0%
i apologize for the way i'm losing my
voice

01:01:05.109 --> 01:01:05.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.510 --> 01:01:09.520 align:start position:0%
yeah i i see on page 1220
 
01:01:12.950 --> 01:01:12.960 align:start position:0%
it's uh 2 37
 
01:01:16.230 --> 01:01:16.240 align:start position:0%
and then it goes up to 247 the following
 
01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:17.589 align:start position:0%
and then it goes up to 247 the following
year

01:01:17.589 --> 01:01:17.599 align:start position:0%
year
 
01:01:21.270 --> 01:01:21.280 align:start position:0%
and so what you're saying
 
01:01:27.190 --> 01:01:27.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:30.630 --> 01:01:30.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't provide sufficient dollars to
 
01:01:34.710 --> 01:01:34.720 align:start position:0%
operate the program that
 
01:01:38.710 --> 01:01:38.720 align:start position:0%
we need an additional 8 000
 
01:01:41.829 --> 01:01:41.839 align:start position:0%
and 7.8
 
01:01:49.190 --> 01:01:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:52.789 --> 01:01:52.799 align:start position:0%
you're muted timmy oh i'm sorry
 
01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:55.920 align:start position:0%
you're open now your mic is still not
 
01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
working that great that's all you said i
 
01:01:59.430 --> 01:01:59.440 align:start position:0%
heard i saw you say no but i didn't hear
 
01:02:01.109 --> 01:02:01.119 align:start position:0%
anything no
 
01:02:04.829 --> 01:02:04.839 align:start position:0%
she you are correct representative
 
01:02:04.839 --> 01:02:08.230 align:start position:0%
she you are correct representative
humber

01:02:08.230 --> 01:02:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:12.309 --> 01:02:12.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
the next one down is the uh
 
01:02:21.270 --> 01:02:21.280 align:start position:0%
scholarship for orphans and vets
 
01:02:23.990 --> 01:02:24.000 align:start position:0%
uh it looks like we didn't do anything
 
01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.109 align:start position:0%
uh it looks like we didn't do anything
in

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:28.720 align:start position:0%
20 but we did in 21
 
01:02:32.390 --> 01:02:32.400 align:start position:0%
and then you're asking again for it
 
01:02:35.910 --> 01:02:35.920 align:start position:0%
in 22 and 23.
 
01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:40.549 align:start position:0%
in 22 and 23.
so

01:02:40.549 --> 01:02:40.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:43.910 --> 01:02:43.920 align:start position:0%
anyhow tell tell me what i know but
 
01:02:46.870 --> 01:02:46.880 align:start position:0%
i know that the program is a scholarship
 
01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:47.589 align:start position:0%
i know that the program is a scholarship
program

01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:47.599 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:02:47.599 --> 01:02:51.270 align:start position:0%
program
for

01:02:51.270 --> 01:02:51.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.549 --> 01:02:54.559 align:start position:0%
children whose parents have died while
 
01:02:57.510 --> 01:02:57.520 align:start position:0%
serving in the military exactly either
 
01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:57.990 align:start position:0%
serving in the military exactly either
while

01:02:57.990 --> 01:02:58.000 align:start position:0%
while
 
01:03:00.150 --> 01:03:00.160 align:start position:0%
serving or if it's service related if
 
01:03:01.589 --> 01:03:01.599 align:start position:0%
it's a service connection where if they
 
01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:04.720 align:start position:0%
die after but it's service related
 
01:03:07.270 --> 01:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
then every year we run a variety of
 
01:03:08.470 --> 01:03:08.480 align:start position:0%
programs to try and
 
01:03:12.630 --> 01:03:12.640 align:start position:0%
identify candidates for this scholarship
 
01:03:16.470 --> 01:03:16.480 align:start position:0%
because it is relatively narrowly scoped
 
01:03:18.630 --> 01:03:18.640 align:start position:0%
we have not always been able to award
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
the scholarships because there's no
 
01:03:20.079 --> 01:03:21.270 align:start position:0%
the scholarships because there's no
eligible

01:03:21.270 --> 01:03:21.280 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:03:23.589 --> 01:03:23.599 align:start position:0%
individuals that meet the criteria for
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
this request
 
01:03:27.829 --> 01:03:27.839 align:start position:0%
and we have you know coordinated with
 
01:03:29.349 --> 01:03:29.359 align:start position:0%
the adjutant general
 
01:03:31.029 --> 01:03:31.039 align:start position:0%
to try and identify these folks and do
 
01:03:32.870 --> 01:03:32.880 align:start position:0%
everything we can to try and get it out
 
01:03:34.470 --> 01:03:34.480 align:start position:0%
sometimes there is an eligible student
 
01:03:36.470 --> 01:03:36.480 align:start position:0%
then we're happy to award and sometimes
 
01:03:38.069 --> 01:03:38.079 align:start position:0%
there's not anybody who gets the
 
01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:41.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:45.589 --> 01:03:45.599 align:start position:0%
okay now this says that the uh the
 
01:03:48.230 --> 01:03:48.240 align:start position:0%
sums appropriated will will be
 
01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:49.750 align:start position:0%
sums appropriated will will be
non-lapsing

01:03:49.750 --> 01:03:49.760 align:start position:0%
non-lapsing
 
01:03:53.510 --> 01:03:53.520 align:start position:0%
so how much do we currently have in
 
01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.589 align:start position:0%
so how much do we currently have in
there

01:03:55.589 --> 01:03:55.599 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:03:56.870 --> 01:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
i think timmy knew you were gonna ask
 
01:04:01.349 --> 01:04:01.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:02.710 --> 01:04:02.720 align:start position:0%
i'll look it up and get right back to
 
01:04:05.990 --> 01:04:06.000 align:start position:0%
you how fast okay that'll be fine
 
01:04:09.190 --> 01:04:09.200 align:start position:0%
i'm just you know if i got what you're
 
01:04:09.200 --> 01:04:09.670 align:start position:0%
i'm just you know if i got what you're
saying

01:04:09.670 --> 01:04:09.680 align:start position:0%
saying
 
01:04:13.589 --> 01:04:13.599 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner um that is difficult to
 
01:04:16.150 --> 01:04:16.160 align:start position:0%
necessarily find people and that you
 
01:04:18.390 --> 01:04:18.400 align:start position:0%
know maybe we could uh
 
01:04:21.349 --> 01:04:21.359 align:start position:0%
move this 10 000 to dual and concur
 
01:04:21.359 --> 01:04:22.069 align:start position:0%
move this 10 000 to dual and concur
enrollment

01:04:22.069 --> 01:04:22.079 align:start position:0%
enrollment
 
01:04:24.789 --> 01:04:24.799 align:start position:0%
or so i think there may be some
 
01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:28.000 align:start position:0%
limitations on the bequest
 
01:04:29.109 --> 01:04:29.119 align:start position:0%
there's like you'd have to go back to
 
01:04:30.950 --> 01:04:30.960 align:start position:0%
the original law i think we've actually
 
01:04:32.309 --> 01:04:32.319 align:start position:0%
taken a look at that at one point in
 
01:04:32.319 --> 01:04:33.109 align:start position:0%
taken a look at that at one point in
time

01:04:33.109 --> 01:04:33.119 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
that the law itself and we can go help
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
dig that up
 
01:04:39.109 --> 01:04:39.119 align:start position:0%
enumerated how the bequest was supposed
 
01:04:40.950 --> 01:04:40.960 align:start position:0%
to be used i think or something like
 
01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.309 align:start position:0%
to be used i think or something like
that

01:04:42.309 --> 01:04:42.319 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:04:45.270 --> 01:04:45.280 align:start position:0%
well it's not a bequest it's uh general
 
01:04:45.280 --> 01:04:46.630 align:start position:0%
well it's not a bequest it's uh general
funds

01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:46.640 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:04:48.630 --> 01:04:48.640 align:start position:0%
yeah it has something tied to it i'm not
 
01:04:50.150 --> 01:04:50.160 align:start position:0%
sure what that is but we can go take a
 
01:04:52.829 --> 01:04:52.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:55.029 --> 01:04:55.039 align:start position:0%
representative um
 
01:04:57.349 --> 01:04:57.359 align:start position:0%
right now we have an available balance
 
01:05:04.390 --> 01:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
we have spent twenty five hundred
 
01:05:11.349 --> 01:05:11.359 align:start position:0%
this year um
 
01:05:12.630 --> 01:05:12.640 align:start position:0%
i don't know what that means moving
 
01:05:15.349 --> 01:05:15.359 align:start position:0%
forward but i believe typically it's a
 
01:05:17.589 --> 01:05:17.599 align:start position:0%
four-year program so that may
 
01:05:19.349 --> 01:05:19.359 align:start position:0%
indicate that we'd be spending another 2
 
01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:23.440 align:start position:0%
500 for the next three years
 
01:05:26.309 --> 01:05:26.319 align:start position:0%
right because generally right each year
 
01:05:28.150 --> 01:05:28.160 align:start position:0%
the student gets an award
 
01:05:31.589 --> 01:05:31.599 align:start position:0%
right i i understand that okay
 
01:05:35.470 --> 01:05:35.480 align:start position:0%
thank you uh now let's move on to
 
01:05:35.480 --> 01:05:38.549 align:start position:0%
thank you uh now let's move on to
[Music]

01:05:38.549 --> 01:05:38.559 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:05:41.990 --> 01:05:42.000 align:start position:0%
the next one down the new england
 
01:05:44.390 --> 01:05:44.400 align:start position:0%
board of higher education scholarships
 
01:05:45.750 --> 01:05:45.760 align:start position:0%
and grants
 
01:05:48.870 --> 01:05:48.880 align:start position:0%
and you're asking for
 
01:05:52.789 --> 01:05:52.799 align:start position:0%
147 000 there what is
 
01:05:55.910 --> 01:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
that program all about yeah so that is
 
01:05:56.549 --> 01:05:56.559 align:start position:0%
actually our
 
01:05:59.829 --> 01:05:59.839 align:start position:0%
fees in uh nebby the new england board
 
01:06:01.670 --> 01:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
of higher education
 
01:06:05.750 --> 01:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
um and by participating in nebby
 
01:06:08.870 --> 01:06:08.880 align:start position:0%
it allows new hampshire students to go
 
01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:09.589 align:start position:0%
it allows new hampshire students to go
to

01:06:09.589 --> 01:06:09.599 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:12.319 align:start position:0%
a another new england college at
 
01:06:14.069 --> 01:06:14.079 align:start position:0%
in-state tuition rates
 
01:06:16.150 --> 01:06:16.160 align:start position:0%
if the university system does not
 
01:06:16.160 --> 01:06:17.190 align:start position:0%
if the university system does not
provide

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:17.200 align:start position:0%
provide
 
01:06:20.470 --> 01:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
that particular major i don't disagree
 
01:06:21.670 --> 01:06:21.680 align:start position:0%
that the sum is high
 
01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:24.240 align:start position:0%
we have made several attempts to try and
 
01:06:26.230 --> 01:06:26.240 align:start position:0%
negotiate are we really getting
 
01:06:27.990 --> 01:06:28.000 align:start position:0%
our money's worth there are some
 
01:06:29.589 --> 01:06:29.599 align:start position:0%
analyses that are done that
 
01:06:31.670 --> 01:06:31.680 align:start position:0%
demonstrate that there are several
 
01:06:33.270 --> 01:06:33.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars of
 
01:06:35.349 --> 01:06:35.359 align:start position:0%
tuition savings to new hampshire
 
01:06:36.789 --> 01:06:36.799 align:start position:0%
residents who
 
01:06:40.069 --> 01:06:40.079 align:start position:0%
access this program so uh that is that
 
01:06:42.230 --> 01:06:42.240 align:start position:0%
whole amount is basically our fee
 
01:06:47.910 --> 01:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:50.630 --> 01:06:50.640 align:start position:0%
so it's not really a scholarship it's a

good morning steve did you hear the
 
01:07:51.680 --> 01:07:52.870 align:start position:0%
good morning steve did you hear the
question

01:07:52.870 --> 01:07:52.880 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:07:55.109 --> 01:07:55.119 align:start position:0%
um yes it does cover two-year as well as
 
01:07:55.119 --> 01:07:56.710 align:start position:0%
um yes it does cover two-year as well as
four-year

01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:56.720 align:start position:0%
four-year
 
01:08:01.270 --> 01:08:01.280 align:start position:0%
and the fee also
 
01:08:04.309 --> 01:08:04.319 align:start position:0%
pays for our participation in the
 
01:08:04.319 --> 01:08:05.510 align:start position:0%
pays for our participation in the
national

01:08:05.510 --> 01:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
national
 
01:08:07.910 --> 01:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
sarah agreement which is the reciprocal
 
01:08:07.920 --> 01:08:09.029 align:start position:0%
sarah agreement which is the reciprocal
agreement

01:08:09.029 --> 01:08:09.039 align:start position:0%
agreement
 
01:08:11.910 --> 01:08:11.920 align:start position:0%
that means we don't have to review every
 
01:08:14.309 --> 01:08:14.319 align:start position:0%
single out-of-state college program
 
01:08:16.149 --> 01:08:16.159 align:start position:0%
that's offered in our state and our
 
01:08:18.709 --> 01:08:18.719 align:start position:0%
colleges that offer outside of our state
 
01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:20.159 align:start position:0%
don't have to be reviewed in those
 
01:08:21.829 --> 01:08:21.839 align:start position:0%
states so it saves
 
01:08:24.390 --> 01:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
our institutions funds and it saves the
 
01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:25.030 align:start position:0%
our institutions funds and it saves the
department

01:08:25.030 --> 01:08:25.040 align:start position:0%
department
 
01:08:31.189 --> 01:08:31.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:34.630 --> 01:08:34.640 align:start position:0%
okay now that uh
 
01:08:43.189 --> 01:08:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:47.030 --> 01:08:47.040 align:start position:0%
okay this is the um
 
01:08:50.149 --> 01:08:50.159 align:start position:0%
the educators support
 
01:08:53.349 --> 01:08:53.359 align:start position:0%
for the higher education commission
 
01:08:58.229 --> 01:08:58.239 align:start position:0%
it's uh chose 269.
 
01:09:01.110 --> 01:09:01.120 align:start position:0%
can we talk about that sure can you just
 
01:09:02.229 --> 01:09:02.239 align:start position:0%
give me a um
 
01:09:05.349 --> 01:09:05.359 align:start position:0%
a page in the line i know oh yeah 225
 
01:09:08.709 --> 01:09:08.719 align:start position:0%
12 20. yeah yeah 12 25 is
 
01:09:12.390 --> 01:09:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:13.910 --> 01:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
uh the estimated sorts of funds for
 
01:09:15.709 --> 01:09:15.719 align:start position:0%
higher education commission
 
01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:25.189 --> 01:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
um and so these are the personnel steve
 
01:09:26.309 --> 01:09:26.319 align:start position:0%
i don't know if you want to weigh in on
 
01:09:26.950 --> 01:09:26.960 align:start position:0%
this but this
 
01:09:28.630 --> 01:09:28.640 align:start position:0%
it looks like it's driven principally by
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
our personnel
 
01:09:32.829 --> 01:09:32.839 align:start position:0%
that support the division of higher
 
01:09:32.839 --> 01:09:34.789 align:start position:0%
that support the division of higher
education

01:09:34.789 --> 01:09:34.799 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:09:38.149 --> 01:09:38.159 align:start position:0%
yes um thank you this is primarily the
 
01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:40.319 align:start position:0%
two positions my position
 
01:09:45.110 --> 01:09:45.120 align:start position:0%
um as well as an unclassified position
 
01:09:47.510 --> 01:09:47.520 align:start position:0%
that support the division as well as the
 
01:09:49.430 --> 01:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
higher education commission
 
01:09:52.789 --> 01:09:52.799 align:start position:0%
which is the body that of course
 
01:09:55.430 --> 01:09:55.440 align:start position:0%
the hedc rules roll up to and that
 
01:09:57.189 --> 01:09:57.199 align:start position:0%
commission has rule making authority and
 
01:09:58.070 --> 01:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
consists of
 
01:10:01.270 --> 01:10:01.280 align:start position:0%
college presidents and some lay folks
 
01:10:03.430 --> 01:10:03.440 align:start position:0%
and they handle all of the
 
01:10:03.440 --> 01:10:05.189 align:start position:0%
and they handle all of the
post-secondary

01:10:05.189 --> 01:10:05.199 align:start position:0%
post-secondary
 
01:10:08.310 --> 01:10:08.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:11.830 --> 01:10:11.840 align:start position:0%
okay so the the cost
 
01:10:15.510 --> 01:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
is because of
 
01:10:18.870 --> 01:10:18.880 align:start position:0%
the employee yes
 
01:10:21.430 --> 01:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
yes and steve is one of those employees
 
01:10:22.870 --> 01:10:22.880 align:start position:0%
right so he's definitely
 
01:10:26.229 --> 01:10:26.239 align:start position:0%
any cuts on his line okay
 
01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:29.440 align:start position:0%
so what other
 
01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:31.520 align:start position:0%
commissions do you work with or is this
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:37.990 --> 01:10:38.000 align:start position:0%
well as division director i also oversee
 
01:10:39.350 --> 01:10:39.360 align:start position:0%
the bureau of credentialing
 
01:10:43.189 --> 01:10:43.199 align:start position:0%
the bureau of educator preparation the
 
01:10:44.790 --> 01:10:44.800 align:start position:0%
veteran state approvals that we were
 
01:10:46.470 --> 01:10:46.480 align:start position:0%
speaking of earlier
 
01:10:49.110 --> 01:10:49.120 align:start position:0%
the office of career school licensing
 
01:10:51.189 --> 01:10:51.199 align:start position:0%
the bus driver background check position
 
01:10:52.229 --> 01:10:52.239 align:start position:0%
will be
 
01:10:53.669 --> 01:10:53.679 align:start position:0%
within the bureau of credentialing in my
 
01:10:53.679 --> 01:10:56.790 align:start position:0%
within the bureau of credentialing in my
division

01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:58.390 --> 01:10:58.400 align:start position:0%
as well as the council for teacher
 
01:10:58.400 --> 01:10:59.830 align:start position:0%
as well as the council for teacher
education

01:10:59.830 --> 01:10:59.840 align:start position:0%
education
 
01:11:01.270 --> 01:11:01.280 align:start position:0%
at council for teacher education the
 
01:11:03.110 --> 01:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
professional standards board
 
01:11:07.270 --> 01:11:07.280 align:start position:0%
we supported those two boards
 
01:11:09.910 --> 01:11:09.920 align:start position:0%
okay so did you charge your entire
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
salary here
 
01:11:24.830 --> 01:11:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:24.840 --> 01:11:27.430 align:start position:0%
 
okay

01:11:27.430 --> 01:11:27.440 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:11:30.470 --> 01:11:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:33.669 --> 01:11:33.679 align:start position:0%
so this is just one of the things that
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
uh that you manage you're not full time
 
01:11:42.310 --> 01:11:42.320 align:start position:0%
doing this right so i oversee the entire
 
01:11:42.320 --> 01:11:43.910 align:start position:0%
doing this right so i oversee the entire
division

01:11:43.910 --> 01:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
division
 
01:11:46.790 --> 01:11:46.800 align:start position:0%
but it's paid for out of this account my
 
01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.830 align:start position:0%
but it's paid for out of this account my
salary

01:11:49.830 --> 01:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
01:11:55.510 --> 01:11:55.520 align:start position:0%
let me see how i i need to make a note
 
01:12:06.149 --> 01:12:06.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:08.630 --> 01:12:08.640 align:start position:0%
so rep on burger are you thinking that
 
01:12:10.229 --> 01:12:10.239 align:start position:0%
you know maybe we ought to do some cost
 
01:12:11.990 --> 01:12:12.000 align:start position:0%
allocations into
 
01:12:13.510 --> 01:12:13.520 align:start position:0%
you know credentialing or something like
 
01:12:16.149 --> 01:12:16.159 align:start position:0%
that no i'm i'm not thinking that i'm
 
01:12:18.390 --> 01:12:18.400 align:start position:0%
just trying to understand
 
01:12:22.709 --> 01:12:22.719 align:start position:0%
um i i just thought for a board
 
01:12:26.229 --> 01:12:26.239 align:start position:0%
that wasn't uh paid this was kind of
 
01:12:29.350 --> 01:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
a uh a figure that
 
01:12:33.350 --> 01:12:33.360 align:start position:0%
i i certainly didn't understand
 
01:12:36.870 --> 01:12:36.880 align:start position:0%
so that that's kind of where i'm coming
 
01:12:37.510 --> 01:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
from no
 
01:12:40.709 --> 01:12:40.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:43.750 --> 01:12:43.760 align:start position:0%
it i unders i agree that it's difficult
 
01:12:48.830 --> 01:12:48.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:52.709 --> 01:12:52.719 align:start position:0%
stuff across the board
 
01:12:57.830 --> 01:12:57.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:02.229 --> 01:13:02.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:06.310 --> 01:13:06.320 align:start position:0%
the idea people
 
01:13:12.070 --> 01:13:12.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:12.080 --> 01:13:15.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:13:15.830 --> 01:13:15.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:19.030 --> 01:13:19.040 align:start position:0%
i guess that most
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
is at most of what goes on with this
 
01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.110 align:start position:0%
is at most of what goes on with this
group

01:13:23.110 --> 01:13:23.120 align:start position:0%
group
 
01:13:27.270 --> 01:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
the checking of the
 
01:13:34.229 --> 01:13:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:37.590 --> 01:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
you've gone you what
 
01:13:41.189 --> 01:13:41.199 align:start position:0%
oh i'm sorry i guess i'm not
 
01:13:44.390 --> 01:13:44.400 align:start position:0%
i said are there other things well
 
01:13:47.110 --> 01:13:47.120 align:start position:0%
maybe i should just ask what is what is
 
01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:47.910 align:start position:0%
maybe i should just ask what is what is
the

01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:47.920 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:13:52.149 --> 01:13:52.159 align:start position:0%
general workload of
 
01:13:55.350 --> 01:13:55.360 align:start position:0%
these 21 people that are
 
01:13:58.709 --> 01:13:58.719 align:start position:0%
in the special education
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
for elementary and secondary
 
01:14:04.149 --> 01:14:04.159 align:start position:0%
um so does this include my federal
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
funding as well
 
01:14:08.229 --> 01:14:08.239 align:start position:0%
yeah so this includes a combination of
 
01:14:11.510 --> 01:14:11.520 align:start position:0%
um you know we receive
 
01:14:15.270 --> 01:14:15.280 align:start position:0%
about 40 plus million dollars of federal
 
01:14:17.830 --> 01:14:17.840 align:start position:0%
idea funds plus we get about 30 million
 
01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:18.550 align:start position:0%
idea funds plus we get about 30 million
dollars

01:14:18.550 --> 01:14:18.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:14:22.070 --> 01:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
of state funds so part of it is
 
01:14:25.110 --> 01:14:25.120 align:start position:0%
allocating those funds out to
 
01:14:27.590 --> 01:14:27.600 align:start position:0%
the various uh schools because most of
 
01:14:29.189 --> 01:14:29.199 align:start position:0%
this is pass-through funding to the
 
01:14:29.199 --> 01:14:30.070 align:start position:0%
this is pass-through funding to the
schools

01:14:30.070 --> 01:14:30.080 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:14:32.790 --> 01:14:32.800 align:start position:0%
uh we then provide technical support to
 
01:14:35.510 --> 01:14:35.520 align:start position:0%
the schools in terms of how they will
 
01:14:38.149 --> 01:14:38.159 align:start position:0%
use those funds for the most part those
 
01:14:39.910 --> 01:14:39.920 align:start position:0%
funds are set up in our grant management
 
01:14:41.030 --> 01:14:41.040 align:start position:0%
system so
 
01:14:43.189 --> 01:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
a district will fill out a grant
 
01:14:45.030 --> 01:14:45.040 align:start position:0%
application saying here's how i intend
 
01:14:45.830 --> 01:14:45.840 align:start position:0%
to use
 
01:14:48.470 --> 01:14:48.480 align:start position:0%
my special education funds we'll review
 
01:14:50.149 --> 01:14:50.159 align:start position:0%
those applications and ensure
 
01:14:52.149 --> 01:14:52.159 align:start position:0%
that all of their intended uses are
 
01:14:52.159 --> 01:14:53.990 align:start position:0%
that all of their intended uses are
eligible

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:54.000 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:14:56.070 --> 01:14:56.080 align:start position:0%
then as the districts complete those
 
01:14:56.080 --> 01:14:57.189 align:start position:0%
then as the districts complete those
activities

01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
activities
 
01:14:59.030 --> 01:14:59.040 align:start position:0%
they will report them as completed we
 
01:15:00.870 --> 01:15:00.880 align:start position:0%
will approve or authorize those
 
01:15:03.430 --> 01:15:03.440 align:start position:0%
completed activities as being eligible
 
01:15:06.229 --> 01:15:06.239 align:start position:0%
um so that they can then get paid and
 
01:15:07.910 --> 01:15:07.920 align:start position:0%
then the final piece of that is that we
 
01:15:09.910 --> 01:15:09.920 align:start position:0%
do monitoring so we're actually going
 
01:15:11.270 --> 01:15:11.280 align:start position:0%
out to
 
01:15:14.310 --> 01:15:14.320 align:start position:0%
the districts and going through and
 
01:15:15.910 --> 01:15:15.920 align:start position:0%
really doing an audit of their special
 
01:15:17.910 --> 01:15:17.920 align:start position:0%
education processes to make sure that
 
01:15:19.590 --> 01:15:19.600 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:15:22.470 --> 01:15:22.480 align:start position:0%
complying with the quite extensive rules
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
around special education both state and
 
01:15:24.239 --> 01:15:25.189 align:start position:0%
around special education both state and
federal

01:15:25.189 --> 01:15:25.199 align:start position:0%
federal
 
01:15:26.870 --> 01:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
um and then i think the last piece that
 
01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:28.239 align:start position:0%
you'll have in there is
 
01:15:31.910 --> 01:15:31.920 align:start position:0%
um around a uh complaint
 
01:15:34.950 --> 01:15:34.960 align:start position:0%
resolution so we do have a full-time
 
01:15:36.950 --> 01:15:36.960 align:start position:0%
person who is managing
 
01:15:39.830 --> 01:15:39.840 align:start position:0%
um special education complaints from
 
01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:41.280 align:start position:0%
parents and really just
 
01:15:43.990 --> 01:15:44.000 align:start position:0%
trying to help them navigate uh you know
 
01:15:45.110 --> 01:15:45.120 align:start position:0%
through the various
 
01:15:47.430 --> 01:15:47.440 align:start position:0%
mitigation or mediation type processes
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
that we have
 
01:15:50.870 --> 01:15:50.880 align:start position:0%
um so that they can come to a resolution
 
01:15:53.030 --> 01:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
with their districts
 
01:15:57.270 --> 01:15:57.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you very much um
 
01:16:01.910 --> 01:16:01.920 align:start position:0%
let's go on to uh 1238
 
01:16:06.790 --> 01:16:06.800 align:start position:0%
and the court ordered placements
 
01:16:10.550 --> 01:16:10.560 align:start position:0%
uh i wish representative lynn was here
 
01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:10.950 align:start position:0%
uh i wish representative lynn was here
but

01:16:10.950 --> 01:16:10.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:16:14.310 --> 01:16:14.320 align:start position:0%
um on the on the court ordered
 
01:16:14.320 --> 01:16:17.030 align:start position:0%
um on the on the court ordered
placements

01:16:17.030 --> 01:16:17.040 align:start position:0%
placements
 
01:16:20.310 --> 01:16:20.320 align:start position:0%
what i guess
 
01:16:23.510 --> 01:16:23.520 align:start position:0%
i guess my my question is
 
01:16:27.270 --> 01:16:27.280 align:start position:0%
where what causes a court-ordered
 
01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:28.709 align:start position:0%
where what causes a court-ordered
placement

01:16:28.709 --> 01:16:28.719 align:start position:0%
placement
 
01:16:33.030 --> 01:16:33.040 align:start position:0%
um that um
 
01:16:35.189 --> 01:16:35.199 align:start position:0%
that you know that obviously can't be
 
01:16:37.590 --> 01:16:37.600 align:start position:0%
handled and it's more than
 
01:16:40.950 --> 01:16:40.960 align:start position:0%
it's more than uh a school problem
 
01:16:44.630 --> 01:16:44.640 align:start position:0%
it's so i just i i
 
01:16:47.750 --> 01:16:47.760 align:start position:0%
because i know we're showing uh
 
01:16:51.350 --> 01:16:51.360 align:start position:0%
you know 2 million but
 
01:16:55.830 --> 01:16:55.840 align:start position:0%
we also showed that it cost us 3.2
 
01:16:59.030 --> 01:16:59.040 align:start position:0%
in in 20.
 
01:17:03.189 --> 01:17:03.199 align:start position:0%
so um i just need some help with this
 
01:17:06.950 --> 01:17:06.960 align:start position:0%
so um and i can get an expert at it i'll
 
01:17:07.910 --> 01:17:07.920 align:start position:0%
try to explain it
 
01:17:09.669 --> 01:17:09.679 align:start position:0%
at you know kind of a higher level but
 
01:17:11.510 --> 01:17:11.520 align:start position:0%
there is some degree of detail
 
01:17:13.270 --> 01:17:13.280 align:start position:0%
associated with it but
 
01:17:16.390 --> 01:17:16.400 align:start position:0%
um i believe statutorily
 
01:17:19.750 --> 01:17:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh when the court makes a
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
child a child placement um could be out
 
01:17:23.990 --> 01:17:24.000 align:start position:0%
of district
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
and they say like this child is gonna
 
01:17:27.750 --> 01:17:27.760 align:start position:0%
have to go to this home or this home
 
01:17:29.590 --> 01:17:29.600 align:start position:0%
um and that includes an educational
 
01:17:32.709 --> 01:17:32.719 align:start position:0%
component we're required to pay that
 
01:17:35.510 --> 01:17:35.520 align:start position:0%
uh when those quoted replacements are
 
01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.709 align:start position:0%
uh when those quoted replacements are
made

01:17:36.709 --> 01:17:36.719 align:start position:0%
made
 
01:17:39.830 --> 01:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
um you know they're made to
 
01:17:42.310 --> 01:17:42.320 align:start position:0%
authorize locations it's not like they
 
01:17:42.870 --> 01:17:42.880 align:start position:0%
just can
 
01:17:45.990 --> 01:17:46.000 align:start position:0%
go to any old place but they do go to
 
01:17:49.430 --> 01:17:49.440 align:start position:0%
very specific facilities um and then we
 
01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:49.990 align:start position:0%
very specific facilities um and then we
are

01:17:49.990 --> 01:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:17:53.669 --> 01:17:53.679 align:start position:0%
uh bill for those and
 
01:17:57.030 --> 01:17:57.040 align:start position:0%
have to reimburse those costs uh for
 
01:17:58.790 --> 01:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
this the child's placement there
 
01:18:00.550 --> 01:18:00.560 align:start position:0%
so that's that's probably too high level
 
01:18:02.310 --> 01:18:02.320 align:start position:0%
for you but yeah that's
 
01:18:05.350 --> 01:18:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's i got that i knew that
 
01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:05.910 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's i got that i knew that
but

01:18:05.910 --> 01:18:05.920 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:18:08.070 --> 01:18:08.080 align:start position:0%
i guess i'm looking at trying to figure
 
01:18:10.229 --> 01:18:10.239 align:start position:0%
out the next level down
 
01:18:13.990 --> 01:18:14.000 align:start position:0%
that um you know uh how many children do
 
01:18:14.709 --> 01:18:14.719 align:start position:0%
we have in
 
01:18:17.590 --> 01:18:17.600 align:start position:0%
court ordered placements what is the
 
01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:18.870 align:start position:0%
court ordered placements what is the
general

01:18:18.870 --> 01:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
general
 
01:18:22.950 --> 01:18:22.960 align:start position:0%
reason for the court order um
 
01:18:25.990 --> 01:18:26.000 align:start position:0%
you know are people
 
01:18:27.910 --> 01:18:27.920 align:start position:0%
sending the kids to court rather than
 
01:18:29.110 --> 01:18:29.120 align:start position:0%
taking care of it
 
01:18:32.310 --> 01:18:32.320 align:start position:0%
um you know locally i mean i don't
 
01:18:38.070 --> 01:18:38.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:40.550 --> 01:18:40.560 align:start position:0%
i'll quit at that if you'll just get me
 
01:18:41.830 --> 01:18:41.840 align:start position:0%
i'll get you the information i'll get
 
01:18:43.510 --> 01:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
you some information on that happy to do
 
01:18:43.520 --> 01:18:44.709 align:start position:0%
you some information on that happy to do
that

01:18:44.709 --> 01:18:44.719 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:18:46.149 --> 01:18:46.159 align:start position:0%
unless christine is on i don't know if
 
01:18:49.510 --> 01:18:49.520 align:start position:0%
she wants to weigh in on it or not
 
01:18:51.430 --> 01:18:51.440 align:start position:0%
no i think we should get the information
 
01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:52.719 align:start position:0%
so we give the
 
01:18:56.149 --> 01:18:56.159 align:start position:0%
exact facts but thanks to the question
 
01:18:58.470 --> 01:18:58.480 align:start position:0%
i'd i really i really would appreciate
 
01:18:58.480 --> 01:18:59.990 align:start position:0%
i'd i really i really would appreciate
that

01:18:59.990 --> 01:19:00.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:19:01.910 --> 01:19:01.920 align:start position:0%
unless mickey is becky on ricky's not
 
01:19:01.920 --> 01:19:06.310 align:start position:0%
unless mickey is becky on ricky's not
only

01:19:06.310 --> 01:19:06.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:08.070 --> 01:19:08.080 align:start position:0%
is there a becky for dead or rebecca for
 
01:19:09.510 --> 01:19:09.520 align:start position:0%
that on no yeah
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
i'll go with the air commissioner yeah
 
01:19:12.790 --> 01:19:12.800 align:start position:0%
you can you can just
 
01:19:14.709 --> 01:19:14.719 align:start position:0%
forward the information to us through
 
01:19:16.149 --> 01:19:16.159 align:start position:0%
mickey that will be
 
01:19:21.510 --> 01:19:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:24.630 --> 01:19:24.640 align:start position:0%
on page 1242
 
01:19:28.149 --> 01:19:28.159 align:start position:0%
you've got uh
 
01:19:32.870 --> 01:19:32.880 align:start position:0%
state money for
 
01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:40.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:43.350 --> 01:19:43.360 align:start position:0%
so and where it's a new program
 
01:19:45.430 --> 01:19:45.440 align:start position:0%
according to this
 
01:19:48.830 --> 01:19:48.840 align:start position:0%
and it's um looking at
 
01:19:53.590 --> 01:19:53.600 align:start position:0%
uh 190
 
01:19:56.790 --> 01:19:56.800 align:start position:0%
000 and general funds
 
01:20:00.149 --> 01:20:00.159 align:start position:0%
so can we have some discussion about
 
01:20:00.159 --> 01:20:01.910 align:start position:0%
so can we have some discussion about
this

01:20:01.910 --> 01:20:01.920 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:20:05.270 --> 01:20:05.280 align:start position:0%
new program i didn't see
 
01:20:08.790 --> 01:20:08.800 align:start position:0%
anything nearby unless it's
 
01:20:13.350 --> 01:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
the the student
 
01:20:16.709 --> 01:20:16.719 align:start position:0%
learner support system of care grant
 
01:20:19.910 --> 01:20:19.920 align:start position:0%
if that's it or not but
 
01:20:25.350 --> 01:20:25.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:27.430 --> 01:20:27.440 align:start position:0%
camera you want to jump in yes i can
 
01:20:28.390 --> 01:20:28.400 align:start position:0%
help on that
 
01:20:33.110 --> 01:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
um that is a new accounting unit
 
01:20:36.310 --> 01:20:36.320 align:start position:0%
that we took two positions
 
01:20:39.189 --> 01:20:39.199 align:start position:0%
jimmy you're not you put your hands down
 
01:20:40.390 --> 01:20:40.400 align:start position:0%
because it's not working it's really
 
01:20:42.629 --> 01:20:42.639 align:start position:0%
hard for anybody
 
01:20:49.430 --> 01:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:51.830 --> 01:20:51.840 align:start position:0%
go ahead and talk how's that work does
 
01:20:52.870 --> 01:20:52.880 align:start position:0%
that work
 
01:20:58.830 --> 01:20:58.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:13.669 --> 01:21:13.679 align:start position:0%
we move there was that is the um
 
01:21:15.189 --> 01:21:15.199 align:start position:0%
division of learner support
 
01:21:16.870 --> 01:21:16.880 align:start position:0%
administrative account
 
01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
so we moved one of the positions over to
 
01:21:23.270 --> 01:21:23.280 align:start position:0%
that student wellness so again this is
 
01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:24.070 align:start position:0%
that student wellness so again this is
another

01:21:24.070 --> 01:21:24.080 align:start position:0%
another
 
01:21:27.750 --> 01:21:27.760 align:start position:0%
way like we did with caitlin's division
 
01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
of just trying to align positions
 
01:21:33.830 --> 01:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
into the correct accounting unit and
 
01:21:35.830 --> 01:21:35.840 align:start position:0%
sometimes that requires us to create
 
01:21:37.910 --> 01:21:37.920 align:start position:0%
accounting units and then move positions
 
01:21:37.920 --> 01:21:38.629 align:start position:0%
accounting units and then move positions
over

01:21:38.629 --> 01:21:38.639 align:start position:0%
over
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
and that's what we did in this instance
 
01:21:41.990 --> 01:21:42.000 align:start position:0%
yeah i'm not concerned
 
01:21:44.229 --> 01:21:44.239 align:start position:0%
about the positions i'm concerned about
 
01:21:45.350 --> 01:21:45.360 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:21:47.990 --> 01:21:48.000 align:start position:0%
where did it come from because it wasn't
 
01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:48.629 align:start position:0%
where did it come from because it wasn't
funded

01:21:48.629 --> 01:21:48.639 align:start position:0%
funded
 
01:21:48.639 --> 01:21:52.550 align:start position:0%
funded
before

01:21:52.550 --> 01:21:52.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:54.310 --> 01:21:54.320 align:start position:0%
so i think it may be the naming
 
01:21:56.390 --> 01:21:56.400 align:start position:0%
conventions that i'm using when i
 
01:21:58.390 --> 01:21:58.400 align:start position:0%
develop new accounting units
 
01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:02.080 align:start position:0%
um so the program did exist before
 
01:22:05.669 --> 01:22:05.679 align:start position:0%
but it was housed in uh the learner
 
01:22:05.679 --> 01:22:06.390 align:start position:0%
but it was housed in uh the learner
support

01:22:06.390 --> 01:22:06.400 align:start position:0%
support
 
01:22:10.550 --> 01:22:10.560 align:start position:0%
account 6401 which
 
01:22:19.990 --> 01:22:20.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:22.950 --> 01:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry rep you're on mute sorry so
 
01:22:24.470 --> 01:22:24.480 align:start position:0%
when i look at that i should see a
 
01:22:27.590 --> 01:22:27.600 align:start position:0%
corresponding decrease of 190
 
01:22:31.669 --> 01:22:31.679 align:start position:0%
and 202 when i look back at page
 
01:22:35.430 --> 01:22:35.440 align:start position:0%
you said 234 231
 
01:22:38.870 --> 01:22:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh 12 31 is where you'll see a decrease
 
01:22:42.149 --> 01:22:42.159 align:start position:0%
we went from 614 down to 563
 
01:22:45.510 --> 01:22:45.520 align:start position:0%
it will not often be exactly
 
01:22:47.430 --> 01:22:47.440 align:start position:0%
corresponding because in the meantime we
 
01:22:52.550 --> 01:22:52.560 align:start position:0%
have salary and benefit increases
 
01:22:54.390 --> 01:22:54.400 align:start position:0%
okay so what you're telling me is that
 
01:22:55.990 --> 01:22:56.000 align:start position:0%
the program
 
01:22:59.430 --> 01:22:59.440 align:start position:0%
on page whatever it is 1242
 
01:23:02.950 --> 01:23:02.960 align:start position:0%
was embedded in these dollars
 
01:23:10.310 --> 01:23:10.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:11.990 --> 01:23:12.000 align:start position:0%
but i can't say we don't have a new
 
01:23:13.750 --> 01:23:13.760 align:start position:0%
program over there we're still running
 
01:23:16.229 --> 01:23:16.239 align:start position:0%
basically our mtssd types of programs
 
01:23:16.950 --> 01:23:16.960 align:start position:0%
through the
 
01:23:19.110 --> 01:23:19.120 align:start position:0%
system of care and there's not a new
 
01:23:19.120 --> 01:23:25.590 align:start position:0%
system of care and there's not a new
program

01:23:25.590 --> 01:23:25.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
i i got that i was just trying to figure
 
01:23:36.390 --> 01:23:36.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:41.189 --> 01:23:41.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.950 --> 01:23:48.960 align:start position:0%
let's see here
 
01:23:52.229 --> 01:23:52.239 align:start position:0%
do we i know uh
 
01:23:57.189 --> 01:23:57.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.149 --> 01:24:01.159 align:start position:0%
indicated that um i think the number was
 
01:24:03.270 --> 01:24:03.280 align:start position:0%
157 million
 
01:24:06.790 --> 01:24:06.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:09.910 --> 01:24:09.920 align:start position:0%
carissa act or whatever 156 million
 
01:24:12.470 --> 01:24:12.480 align:start position:0%
okay what's a million dollars here and
 
01:24:13.270 --> 01:24:13.280 align:start position:0%
there in that
 
01:24:20.870 --> 01:24:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:24.229 --> 01:24:24.239 align:start position:0%
when is the how is that going to go out
 
01:24:25.830 --> 01:24:25.840 align:start position:0%
to the school districts
 
01:24:28.629 --> 01:24:28.639 align:start position:0%
is it going out through they come in and
 
01:24:31.030 --> 01:24:31.040 align:start position:0%
ask for it or is it going to be
 
01:24:31.040 --> 01:24:32.870 align:start position:0%
ask for it or is it going to be
distributed

01:24:32.870 --> 01:24:32.880 align:start position:0%
distributed
 
01:24:35.910 --> 01:24:35.920 align:start position:0%
across the
 
01:24:39.110 --> 01:24:39.120 align:start position:0%
the school districts based on something
 
01:24:41.510 --> 01:24:41.520 align:start position:0%
yeah so it will basically be distributed
 
01:24:43.110 --> 01:24:43.120 align:start position:0%
through the grant management system to
 
01:24:44.470 --> 01:24:44.480 align:start position:0%
the districts
 
01:24:47.830 --> 01:24:47.840 align:start position:0%
on a formula allocation based on title
 
01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:50.390 align:start position:0%
on a formula allocation based on title
one

01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:50.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:52.950 --> 01:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
and i um with the when i met with you at
 
01:24:54.470 --> 01:24:54.480 align:start position:0%
the overview i don't know if you recall
 
01:24:56.070 --> 01:24:56.080 align:start position:0%
it was kind of like a high level summary
 
01:24:57.350 --> 01:24:57.360 align:start position:0%
that i gave you on all these different
 
01:24:58.870 --> 01:24:58.880 align:start position:0%
pieces of federal funds
 
01:25:02.310 --> 01:25:02.320 align:start position:0%
because in all told there's 305 million
 
01:25:04.550 --> 01:25:04.560 align:start position:0%
and so we've kind of outlined for you
 
01:25:06.550 --> 01:25:06.560 align:start position:0%
what those are and how those can be used
 
01:25:07.830 --> 01:25:07.840 align:start position:0%
and how those will be
 
01:25:10.950 --> 01:25:10.960 align:start position:0%
made available to the districts
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
okay so um
 
01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:15.189 align:start position:0%
okay so um
[Music]

01:25:15.189 --> 01:25:15.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:25:17.910 --> 01:25:17.920 align:start position:0%
yeah i remember that that whole thing
 
01:25:19.110 --> 01:25:19.120 align:start position:0%
but i
 
01:25:22.070 --> 01:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
you had said at the time that this
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
second tranche of money
 
01:25:27.430 --> 01:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
had not gone out so when do you expect
 
01:25:32.149 --> 01:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
that this next tranche will go out
 
01:25:35.270 --> 01:25:35.280 align:start position:0%
so it should be fairly soon um so
 
01:25:38.070 --> 01:25:38.080 align:start position:0%
just to be clear of the 34 million that
 
01:25:39.430 --> 01:25:39.440 align:start position:0%
we've already made available to the
 
01:25:41.990 --> 01:25:42.000 align:start position:0%
district since last may
 
01:25:44.390 --> 01:25:44.400 align:start position:0%
only 7 million has been accessed and so
 
01:25:45.830 --> 01:25:45.840 align:start position:0%
these funds can be used
 
01:25:48.390 --> 01:25:48.400 align:start position:0%
for the same kinds of things the only
 
01:25:49.830 --> 01:25:49.840 align:start position:0%
reason we haven't actually made them
 
01:25:51.189 --> 01:25:51.199 align:start position:0%
available yet is
 
01:25:53.270 --> 01:25:53.280 align:start position:0%
in order to accommodate these grant
 
01:25:55.669 --> 01:25:55.679 align:start position:0%
funds in our grant management system
 
01:25:58.790 --> 01:25:58.800 align:start position:0%
we had to hire a programmer to be able
 
01:26:00.950 --> 01:26:00.960 align:start position:0%
to make modifications to the system to
 
01:26:02.390 --> 01:26:02.400 align:start position:0%
kind of replicate that grand
 
01:26:02.400 --> 01:26:03.590 align:start position:0%
kind of replicate that grand
infrastructure

01:26:03.590 --> 01:26:03.600 align:start position:0%
infrastructure
 
01:26:06.550 --> 01:26:06.560 align:start position:0%
for this grant i believe that that
 
01:26:07.990 --> 01:26:08.000 align:start position:0%
contract has now been approved
 
01:26:09.110 --> 01:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
and so they'll be making those
 
01:26:11.270 --> 01:26:11.280 align:start position:0%
modifications to the system once the
 
01:26:12.790 --> 01:26:12.800 align:start position:0%
system is set up
 
01:26:15.830 --> 01:26:15.840 align:start position:0%
then the schools will be able to go into
 
01:26:17.669 --> 01:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
the grant management system and access
 
01:26:18.709 --> 01:26:18.719 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
01:26:21.030 --> 01:26:21.040 align:start position:0%
in the meantime we have already given
 
01:26:22.149 --> 01:26:22.159 align:start position:0%
them their
 
01:26:23.990 --> 01:26:24.000 align:start position:0%
preliminary estimates in terms of the
 
01:26:26.390 --> 01:26:26.400 align:start position:0%
amount of money and the eligible
 
01:26:29.189 --> 01:26:29.199 align:start position:0%
usage for those funds so they today can
 
01:26:31.270 --> 01:26:31.280 align:start position:0%
be planning for how they will use those
 
01:26:31.280 --> 01:26:31.910 align:start position:0%
be planning for how they will use those
once

01:26:31.910 --> 01:26:31.920 align:start position:0%
once
 
01:26:33.990 --> 01:26:34.000 align:start position:0%
we have the system accessible that they
 
01:26:38.629 --> 01:26:38.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:26:41.830 --> 01:26:41.840 align:start position:0%
okay so um do you have
 
01:26:43.910 --> 01:26:43.920 align:start position:0%
do you have a clue as to when that's
 
01:26:45.910 --> 01:26:45.920 align:start position:0%
going to actually happen
 
01:26:50.709 --> 01:26:50.719 align:start position:0%
i would hope in the next couple of weeks
 
01:26:52.229 --> 01:26:52.239 align:start position:0%
is there i mean because i've heard from
 
01:26:53.830 --> 01:26:53.840 align:start position:0%
some other folks that
 
01:26:54.950 --> 01:26:54.960 align:start position:0%
you know i've heard from some schools
 
01:26:56.629 --> 01:26:56.639 align:start position:0%
saying like hey we want access to these
 
01:26:56.639 --> 01:26:58.070 align:start position:0%
saying like hey we want access to these
funds

01:26:58.070 --> 01:26:58.080 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:27:00.709 --> 01:27:00.719 align:start position:0%
but i everyone who's asked and says and
 
01:27:02.629 --> 01:27:02.639 align:start position:0%
there's concern about having access to
 
01:27:04.629 --> 01:27:04.639 align:start position:0%
those funds still has
 
01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:07.920 align:start position:0%
access to unused ester one funding
 
01:27:10.070 --> 01:27:10.080 align:start position:0%
um and so we just encourage them to use
 
01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:11.440 align:start position:0%
those funds
 
01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:13.280 align:start position:0%
today if they have an exigent expense
 
01:27:14.229 --> 01:27:14.239 align:start position:0%
they're saying like we need to spend
 
01:27:15.350 --> 01:27:15.360 align:start position:0%
money today i'm like
 
01:27:16.709 --> 01:27:16.719 align:start position:0%
well you have these other funds just
 
01:27:18.870 --> 01:27:18.880 align:start position:0%
spend those down quite frankly those
 
01:27:20.870 --> 01:27:20.880 align:start position:0%
expenses are going to expire they have a
 
01:27:22.229 --> 01:27:22.239 align:start position:0%
shorter timetable
 
01:27:25.430 --> 01:27:25.440 align:start position:0%
and we want them to use those first and
 
01:27:25.440 --> 01:27:26.149 align:start position:0%
and we want them to use those first and
so

01:27:26.149 --> 01:27:26.159 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:29.270 --> 01:27:29.280 align:start position:0%
while i have heard from not from many
 
01:27:29.280 --> 01:27:30.310 align:start position:0%
while i have heard from not from many
districts

01:27:30.310 --> 01:27:30.320 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:27:32.229 --> 01:27:32.239 align:start position:0%
necessarily but from people outside of
 
01:27:33.750 --> 01:27:33.760 align:start position:0%
districts saying like when are you going
 
01:27:35.350 --> 01:27:35.360 align:start position:0%
to make these funds available
 
01:27:37.350 --> 01:27:37.360 align:start position:0%
in fact the schools have funds available
 
01:27:39.030 --> 01:27:39.040 align:start position:0%
to do the things they need to get done
 
01:27:41.110 --> 01:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
i have not come across a district that
 
01:27:43.590 --> 01:27:43.600 align:start position:0%
is doesn't have funding available to
 
01:27:43.600 --> 01:27:44.070 align:start position:0%
is doesn't have funding available to
them

01:27:44.070 --> 01:27:44.080 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:27:45.590 --> 01:27:45.600 align:start position:0%
and so again we're working through as
 
01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:47.280 align:start position:0%
quickly as we can as you all are
 
01:27:48.950 --> 01:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
familiar with the contracting process at
 
01:27:49.910 --> 01:27:49.920 align:start position:0%
the state level
 
01:27:52.149 --> 01:27:52.159 align:start position:0%
to hire somebody and get them to make
 
01:27:53.910 --> 01:27:53.920 align:start position:0%
the changes and stuff like that
 
01:27:55.350 --> 01:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
um getting to make the change will be
 
01:27:56.390 --> 01:27:56.400 align:start position:0%
the easy part getting through the
 
01:27:57.590 --> 01:27:57.600 align:start position:0%
contracting process would
 
01:27:59.990 --> 01:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
be the most difficult and so that just
 
01:28:02.070 --> 01:28:02.080 align:start position:0%
has to happen and then we'll be able to
 
01:28:03.270 --> 01:28:03.280 align:start position:0%
make those available in the grant
 
01:28:05.430 --> 01:28:05.440 align:start position:0%
management system do you have
 
01:28:07.590 --> 01:28:07.600 align:start position:0%
do you have constituents who are
 
01:28:09.590 --> 01:28:09.600 align:start position:0%
concerned that they need these funds
 
01:28:11.189 --> 01:28:11.199 align:start position:0%
accidentally and they're not able to
 
01:28:13.030 --> 01:28:13.040 align:start position:0%
access them
 
01:28:16.950 --> 01:28:16.960 align:start position:0%
uh no every time i every time i ask
 
01:28:19.990 --> 01:28:20.000 align:start position:0%
they say things are fine so
 
01:28:23.030 --> 01:28:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh that's what i'm here to do so
 
01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:26.159 align:start position:0%
but if we're not if we're not spending
 
01:28:30.470 --> 01:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
i find it strange to send them more
 
01:28:37.990 --> 01:28:38.000 align:start position:0%
and that maybe our allocation
 
01:28:42.149 --> 01:28:42.159 align:start position:0%
method uh
 
01:28:44.310 --> 01:28:44.320 align:start position:0%
needs to change unless that's federal
 
01:28:45.669 --> 01:28:45.679 align:start position:0%
law but i think
 
01:28:47.590 --> 01:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
a law yeah i don't have any input into
 
01:28:48.709 --> 01:28:48.719 align:start position:0%
that that's how it comes
 
01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:52.000 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear with the most
 
01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:52.709 align:start position:0%
and just to be clear with the most
recent

01:28:52.709 --> 01:28:52.719 align:start position:0%
recent
 
01:28:55.669 --> 01:28:55.679 align:start position:0%
um relief act that was passed uh we
 
01:28:55.679 --> 01:28:56.149 align:start position:0%
um relief act that was passed uh we
would

01:28:56.149 --> 01:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
would
 
01:28:58.310 --> 01:28:58.320 align:start position:0%
be receiving additional funds um i
 
01:28:59.990 --> 01:29:00.000 align:start position:0%
haven't seen all of the details
 
01:29:01.510 --> 01:29:01.520 align:start position:0%
associated with that but
 
01:29:04.229 --> 01:29:04.239 align:start position:0%
you know potentially as much as 300
 
01:29:05.430 --> 01:29:05.440 align:start position:0%
million more
 
01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:09.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:12.870 --> 01:29:12.880 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative murray you have a
 
01:29:12.880 --> 01:29:13.830 align:start position:0%
yeah uh representative murray you have a
question

01:29:13.830 --> 01:29:13.840 align:start position:0%
question
 
01:29:16.149 --> 01:29:16.159 align:start position:0%
yes thank you is there a drop dead date
 
01:29:17.669 --> 01:29:17.679 align:start position:0%
at which these funds have to
 
01:29:20.390 --> 01:29:20.400 align:start position:0%
all be used and is that going to create
 
01:29:22.709 --> 01:29:22.719 align:start position:0%
a problem that you might foresee
 
01:29:25.110 --> 01:29:25.120 align:start position:0%
so i don't they have to be allocated by
 
01:29:29.430 --> 01:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:29:31.830 --> 01:29:31.840 align:start position:0%
you have a pretty good runway on that
 
01:29:33.910 --> 01:29:33.920 align:start position:0%
but that was the cares act right the
 
01:29:35.030 --> 01:29:35.040 align:start position:0%
first one
 
01:29:37.990 --> 01:29:38.000 align:start position:0%
no that funding is um oh yeah that's
 
01:29:40.870 --> 01:29:40.880 align:start position:0%
september 22 i said obligated so the
 
01:29:43.030 --> 01:29:43.040 align:start position:0%
has to be spent by that day but this one
 
01:29:44.470 --> 01:29:44.480 align:start position:0%
is obligated by 22
 
01:29:48.950 --> 01:29:48.960 align:start position:0%
spent by 23. okay that was the 900 well
 
01:29:49.750 --> 01:29:49.760 align:start position:0%
whatever the 100
 
01:29:53.990 --> 01:29:54.000 align:start position:0%
156 right okay okay so
 
01:29:57.750 --> 01:29:57.760 align:start position:0%
all right so we do have we do have quite
 
01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:58.310 align:start position:0%
all right so we do have we do have quite
a

01:29:58.310 --> 01:29:58.320 align:start position:0%
a
 
01:30:01.350 --> 01:30:01.360 align:start position:0%
runway um to access those funds
 
01:30:02.870 --> 01:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
and truthfully you know we will have the
 
01:30:04.870 --> 01:30:04.880 align:start position:0%
funds out and available but one of the
 
01:30:07.189 --> 01:30:07.199 align:start position:0%
things that is
 
01:30:08.950 --> 01:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
kind of a priority for those funds from
 
01:30:10.550 --> 01:30:10.560 align:start position:0%
the u.s department of education
 
01:30:11.910 --> 01:30:11.920 align:start position:0%
is really around learning loss and
 
01:30:13.189 --> 01:30:13.199 align:start position:0%
summer programming and what we're going
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:21.350 --> 01:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
well i will be surprised if school
 
01:30:22.470 --> 01:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
systems that
 
01:30:25.669 --> 01:30:25.679 align:start position:0%
don't have summer school would be able
 
01:30:27.590 --> 01:30:27.600 align:start position:0%
to gin up summer school
 
01:30:30.950 --> 01:30:30.960 align:start position:0%
especially for the young kids
 
01:30:33.430 --> 01:30:33.440 align:start position:0%
you know that i mean i realize the older
 
01:30:34.550 --> 01:30:34.560 align:start position:0%
kids are having
 
01:30:39.430 --> 01:30:39.440 align:start position:0%
problems as well but uh the
 
01:30:42.229 --> 01:30:42.239 align:start position:0%
the real problem is down in the uh in
 
01:30:43.270 --> 01:30:43.280 align:start position:0%
the younger kids
 
01:30:46.830 --> 01:30:46.840 align:start position:0%
but that's my that's my assessment
 
01:30:46.840 --> 01:30:48.629 align:start position:0%
but that's my that's my assessment
overall

01:30:48.629 --> 01:30:48.639 align:start position:0%
overall
 
01:30:53.189 --> 01:30:53.199 align:start position:0%
okay thank you so let's go to
 
01:30:57.669 --> 01:30:57.679 align:start position:0%
school let's see this is on page 1258
 
01:31:00.830 --> 01:31:00.840 align:start position:0%
which is school nutrition state
 
01:31:06.629 --> 01:31:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:11.350 --> 01:31:11.360 align:start position:0%
okay so we know that
 
01:31:16.950 --> 01:31:16.960 align:start position:0%
everybody that wants a free lunch once
 
01:31:22.709 --> 01:31:22.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
what is going on with this money for the
 
01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:28.709 align:start position:0%
what is going on with this money for the
future

01:31:28.709 --> 01:31:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:31.750 --> 01:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
uh well so we even in order to be
 
01:31:31.760 --> 01:31:32.470 align:start position:0%
uh well so we even in order to be
eligible

01:31:32.470 --> 01:31:32.480 align:start position:0%
eligible
 
01:31:34.550 --> 01:31:34.560 align:start position:0%
for our federal food and nutrition
 
01:31:35.910 --> 01:31:35.920 align:start position:0%
grants from the u.s department of
 
01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:37.110 align:start position:0%
grants from the u.s department of
agriculture

01:31:37.110 --> 01:31:37.120 align:start position:0%
agriculture
 
01:31:39.270 --> 01:31:39.280 align:start position:0%
we have a mass i believe this match goes
 
01:31:40.790 --> 01:31:40.800 align:start position:0%
back you know
 
01:31:43.350 --> 01:31:43.360 align:start position:0%
decades in terms of the amount of match
 
01:31:43.910 --> 01:31:43.920 align:start position:0%
they haven't
 
01:31:46.550 --> 01:31:46.560 align:start position:0%
increased it but we have to continue to
 
01:31:47.830 --> 01:31:47.840 align:start position:0%
spend a certain
 
01:31:49.830 --> 01:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
level of state funds in order to be
 
01:31:52.149 --> 01:31:52.159 align:start position:0%
eligible to participate in the usda
 
01:31:55.750 --> 01:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
funding so this you know would be
 
01:31:57.189 --> 01:31:57.199 align:start position:0%
required if we want to continue to
 
01:31:58.149 --> 01:31:58.159 align:start position:0%
receive those
 
01:32:02.390 --> 01:32:02.400 align:start position:0%
usda funds okay and what is the
 
01:32:05.750 --> 01:32:05.760 align:start position:0%
state fund non-match
 
01:32:08.950 --> 01:32:08.960 align:start position:0%
so this is uh basically the state
 
01:32:11.110 --> 01:32:11.120 align:start position:0%
breakfast reimbursement funding that
 
01:32:13.510 --> 01:32:13.520 align:start position:0%
there was a bill that was passed on that
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
so they basically uh so you have
 
01:32:18.550 --> 01:32:18.560 align:start position:0%
free and you have reduced and just
 
01:32:20.149 --> 01:32:20.159 align:start position:0%
basically took away kind of a reduced
 
01:32:21.350 --> 01:32:21.360 align:start position:0%
category just made them
 
01:32:28.390 --> 01:32:28.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
i i i yeah i'm not sure i understood
 
01:32:31.590 --> 01:32:31.600 align:start position:0%
what you said but
 
01:32:34.229 --> 01:32:34.239 align:start position:0%
i'll get it so some students qualify for
 
01:32:34.239 --> 01:32:35.110 align:start position:0%
i'll get it so some students qualify for
free

01:32:35.110 --> 01:32:35.120 align:start position:0%
free
 
01:32:36.550 --> 01:32:36.560 align:start position:0%
um and so then they're providing their
 
01:32:38.950 --> 01:32:38.960 align:start position:0%
meals for free other students
 
01:32:41.030 --> 01:32:41.040 align:start position:0%
are qualified as reduced and so they're
 
01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:41.990 align:start position:0%
are qualified as reduced and so they're
contributing

01:32:41.990 --> 01:32:42.000 align:start position:0%
contributing
 
01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:43.920 align:start position:0%
maybe 30 cents per meal or something
 
01:32:45.430 --> 01:32:45.440 align:start position:0%
like that um
 
01:32:47.750 --> 01:32:47.760 align:start position:0%
and so this with a piece of legislation
 
01:32:49.669 --> 01:32:49.679 align:start position:0%
that was passed that
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
eliminated the reduce then just made it
 
01:32:52.840 --> 01:33:01.030 align:start position:0%
eliminated the reduce then just made it
great

01:33:01.030 --> 01:33:01.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:04.709 --> 01:33:04.719 align:start position:0%
okay thank you uh representative murray
 
01:33:07.270 --> 01:33:07.280 align:start position:0%
thank you again can you pop back a page
 
01:33:08.629 --> 01:33:08.639 align:start position:0%
to 1257
 
01:33:11.510 --> 01:33:11.520 align:start position:0%
and start the story with a federal grant
 
01:33:12.709 --> 01:33:12.719 align:start position:0%
looks like it's been cut
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
pretty much in half can you speak to
 
01:33:15.750 --> 01:33:15.760 align:start position:0%
that and how that's
 
01:33:17.590 --> 01:33:17.600 align:start position:0%
impacts going on to the next couple
 
01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:20.390 align:start position:0%
impacts going on to the next couple
pages

01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:22.310 --> 01:33:22.320 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what line item you're on
 
01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:23.870 align:start position:0%
can you tell me what line item you're on
um

01:33:23.870 --> 01:33:23.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:33:26.870 --> 01:33:26.880 align:start position:0%
seventy-two on pages
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
from 57 to 2500 actually
 
01:33:32.709 --> 01:33:32.719 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna let you wait on that one looks
 
01:33:44.950 --> 01:33:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:48.709 --> 01:33:48.719 align:start position:0%
2.5 million um
 
01:33:51.990 --> 01:33:52.000 align:start position:0%
so this is we get in like
 
01:33:54.629 --> 01:33:54.639 align:start position:0%
seven different grants from the federal
 
01:33:54.639 --> 01:33:55.350 align:start position:0%
seven different grants from the federal
government

01:33:55.350 --> 01:33:55.360 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:33:59.350 --> 01:33:59.360 align:start position:0%
and we are trying to realign them
 
01:34:02.310 --> 01:34:02.320 align:start position:0%
into our state accounting units the way
 
01:34:02.950 --> 01:34:02.960 align:start position:0%
that we
 
01:34:05.910 --> 01:34:05.920 align:start position:0%
so that this we made some changes so
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
that we can do
 
01:34:08.870 --> 01:34:08.880 align:start position:0%
reporting to the federal government
 
01:34:11.189 --> 01:34:11.199 align:start position:0%
easier on our side
 
01:34:17.430 --> 01:34:17.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:22.709 --> 01:34:22.719 align:start position:0%
you'll see on previous page on 1256
 
01:34:26.149 --> 01:34:26.159 align:start position:0%
class 72 went up
 
01:34:29.270 --> 01:34:29.280 align:start position:0%
so this is us realigning on our site so
 
01:34:30.629 --> 01:34:30.639 align:start position:0%
that we can report to the federal
 
01:34:30.639 --> 01:34:31.430 align:start position:0%
that we can report to the federal
government

01:34:31.430 --> 01:34:31.440 align:start position:0%
government
 
01:34:31.440 --> 01:34:35.110 align:start position:0%
government
easier

01:34:35.110 --> 01:34:35.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:37.350 --> 01:34:37.360 align:start position:0%
so there was no there were no dollars
 
01:34:39.750 --> 01:34:39.760 align:start position:0%
lost it's just that
 
01:34:42.070 --> 01:34:42.080 align:start position:0%
if you add up all those they still come
 
01:34:44.229 --> 01:34:44.239 align:start position:0%
out to the same thing
 
01:34:46.390 --> 01:34:46.400 align:start position:0%
or at least to our estimate of the grant
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
and then in addition to that we have the
 
01:34:49.189 --> 01:34:49.199 align:start position:0%
code of grants that we got
 
01:34:52.310 --> 01:34:52.320 align:start position:0%
from the usda as well representative
 
01:34:54.390 --> 01:34:54.400 align:start position:0%
heath you have a question
 
01:34:57.350 --> 01:34:57.360 align:start position:0%
thank you um would it be possible
 
01:34:58.709 --> 01:34:58.719 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of that
 
01:35:01.590 --> 01:35:01.600 align:start position:0%
in this budget and where you move things
 
01:35:01.600 --> 01:35:02.390 align:start position:0%
in this budget and where you move things
around

01:35:02.390 --> 01:35:02.400 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:35:04.870 --> 01:35:04.880 align:start position:0%
are there footnotes or are there things
 
01:35:06.790 --> 01:35:06.800 align:start position:0%
that that would help us to better
 
01:35:06.800 --> 01:35:07.910 align:start position:0%
that that would help us to better
understand

01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
understand
 
01:35:11.189 --> 01:35:11.199 align:start position:0%
what you've done through this budget um
 
01:35:14.310 --> 01:35:14.320 align:start position:0%
that would kind of be a a
 
01:35:16.310 --> 01:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
a walk through the changes that you've
 
01:35:16.320 --> 01:35:20.070 align:start position:0%
a walk through the changes that you've
made

01:35:20.070 --> 01:35:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:23.430 --> 01:35:23.440 align:start position:0%
i don't know if that counts um
 
01:35:29.030 --> 01:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
it's pretty much all in my head
 
01:35:32.229 --> 01:35:32.239 align:start position:0%
uh uh i i could try and put something
 
01:35:33.590 --> 01:35:33.600 align:start position:0%
together i don't know
 
01:35:37.350 --> 01:35:37.360 align:start position:0%
if it would make much more sense than
 
01:35:40.950 --> 01:35:40.960 align:start position:0%
what i'm describing because um
 
01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:42.880 align:start position:0%
something comes in and something goes
 
01:35:43.990 --> 01:35:44.000 align:start position:0%
out so it
 
01:35:47.189 --> 01:35:47.199 align:start position:0%
you know it may be so convoluted but i
 
01:35:49.270 --> 01:35:49.280 align:start position:0%
can certainly try
 
01:35:53.270 --> 01:35:53.280 align:start position:0%
okay thank you it's just it's confusing
 
01:35:54.229 --> 01:35:54.239 align:start position:0%
because step is
 
01:35:56.790 --> 01:35:56.800 align:start position:0%
is all changed around and unless you're
 
01:35:59.270 --> 01:35:59.280 align:start position:0%
here to tell us what the change is
 
01:36:01.430 --> 01:36:01.440 align:start position:0%
and of the reduction in one place and
 
01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:02.800 align:start position:0%
increase in another place
 
01:36:06.629 --> 01:36:06.639 align:start position:0%
and then right so i i do think i mean
 
01:36:08.310 --> 01:36:08.320 align:start position:0%
at a very high level if you look at the
 
01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
last page of the budget
 
01:36:12.950 --> 01:36:12.960 align:start position:0%
on 1290 1295
 
01:36:14.149 --> 01:36:14.159 align:start position:0%
so it shows the department of
 
01:36:15.830 --> 01:36:15.840 align:start position:0%
education's federal general and other
 
01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.109 align:start position:0%
education's federal general and other
funds

01:36:17.109 --> 01:36:17.119 align:start position:0%
funds
 
01:36:19.030 --> 01:36:19.040 align:start position:0%
and that you can really see you know our
 
01:36:20.629 --> 01:36:20.639 align:start position:0%
federal funds changes
 
01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:22.159 align:start position:0%
you know the predicted increase in
 
01:36:23.750 --> 01:36:23.760 align:start position:0%
federal funds
 
01:36:25.189 --> 01:36:25.199 align:start position:0%
some of the general funds which has
 
01:36:26.629 --> 01:36:26.639 align:start position:0%
actually decreased about five million
 
01:36:28.950 --> 01:36:28.960 align:start position:0%
dollars and our other funds which has
 
01:36:30.629 --> 01:36:30.639 align:start position:0%
decreased as well other funds is
 
01:36:32.550 --> 01:36:32.560 align:start position:0%
inclusive of the education trust fund
 
01:36:34.390 --> 01:36:34.400 align:start position:0%
the majority of that decreases relative
 
01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:36.400 align:start position:0%
to the decrease in adequacy
 
01:36:38.070 --> 01:36:38.080 align:start position:0%
and then you can also see the number of
 
01:36:42.629 --> 01:36:42.639 align:start position:0%
positions the um so we had 282 positions
 
01:36:46.070 --> 01:36:46.080 align:start position:0%
proposed last year as opposed to 289
 
01:36:47.990 --> 01:36:48.000 align:start position:0%
um i know it's super super high level so
 
01:36:49.590 --> 01:36:49.600 align:start position:0%
you can't see you know tammy had a
 
01:36:50.950 --> 01:36:50.960 align:start position:0%
position in her side of the budget
 
01:36:51.830 --> 01:36:51.840 align:start position:0%
that's now in my
 
01:36:55.430 --> 01:36:55.440 align:start position:0%
side but um that might be kind of
 
01:36:57.669 --> 01:36:57.679 align:start position:0%
at least a helpful part to look at okay
 
01:37:00.229 --> 01:37:00.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:02.070 --> 01:37:02.080 align:start position:0%
i guess it would be helpful because you
 
01:37:03.430 --> 01:37:03.440 align:start position:0%
know looking at what you're saying
 
01:37:05.189 --> 01:37:05.199 align:start position:0%
caitlyn you get that sense that there's
 
01:37:05.199 --> 01:37:05.430 align:start position:0%
caitlyn you get that sense that there's
an

01:37:05.430 --> 01:37:05.440 align:start position:0%
an
 
01:37:08.390 --> 01:37:08.400 align:start position:0%
arc but um there's still that gap
 
01:37:09.990 --> 01:37:10.000 align:start position:0%
between does that mean there's been a
 
01:37:10.950 --> 01:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
loss or
 
01:37:13.030 --> 01:37:13.040 align:start position:0%
just a move to someplace else in terms
 
01:37:14.950 --> 01:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
of some of the fun so yeah it's a
 
01:37:18.550 --> 01:37:18.560 align:start position:0%
it's quite the string puzzle to sort it
 
01:37:18.560 --> 01:37:19.189 align:start position:0%
it's quite the string puzzle to sort it
out

01:37:19.189 --> 01:37:19.199 align:start position:0%
out
 
01:37:23.030 --> 01:37:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:26.470 --> 01:37:26.480 align:start position:0%
okay um the next
 
01:37:31.109 --> 01:37:31.119 align:start position:0%
is on for me is on page 1262
 
01:37:36.550 --> 01:37:36.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:40.070 --> 01:37:40.080 align:start position:0%
uh it looked like there was no money
 
01:37:43.109 --> 01:37:43.119 align:start position:0%
in 20 we put
 
01:37:46.229 --> 01:37:46.239 align:start position:0%
100 000 in 21
 
01:37:49.430 --> 01:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
and now we're at 50 000.
 
01:37:53.430 --> 01:37:53.440 align:start position:0%
so can somebody talk about this please
 
01:37:55.910 --> 01:37:55.920 align:start position:0%
sure so we had initially budgeted last
 
01:37:57.430 --> 01:37:57.440 align:start position:0%
time a hundred thousand
 
01:37:59.350 --> 01:37:59.360 align:start position:0%
um and this is to pay for advanced
 
01:38:00.830 --> 01:38:00.840 align:start position:0%
placement tests for our
 
01:38:03.990 --> 01:38:04.000 align:start position:0%
students principally we target
 
01:38:06.470 --> 01:38:06.480 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged students in
 
01:38:06.480 --> 01:38:07.189 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged students in
20

01:38:07.189 --> 01:38:07.199 align:start position:0%
20
 
01:38:09.270 --> 01:38:09.280 align:start position:0%
you don't see any spending there because
 
01:38:10.950 --> 01:38:10.960 align:start position:0%
of the pandemic
 
01:38:13.990 --> 01:38:14.000 align:start position:0%
that disrupted the ap exam and
 
01:38:16.790 --> 01:38:16.800 align:start position:0%
college board went to an all online
 
01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:17.830 align:start position:0%
college board went to an all online
assessment

01:38:17.830 --> 01:38:17.840 align:start position:0%
assessment
 
01:38:20.149 --> 01:38:20.159 align:start position:0%
and basically provided they themselves
 
01:38:21.990 --> 01:38:22.000 align:start position:0%
provided scholarships to students so we
 
01:38:23.830 --> 01:38:23.840 align:start position:0%
weren't we didn't need to at that point
 
01:38:25.109 --> 01:38:25.119 align:start position:0%
in time
 
01:38:28.629 --> 01:38:28.639 align:start position:0%
we had budgeted 100 000 but again trying
 
01:38:29.430 --> 01:38:29.440 align:start position:0%
to meet
 
01:38:31.990 --> 01:38:32.000 align:start position:0%
the requirement for uh the budget
 
01:38:33.510 --> 01:38:33.520 align:start position:0%
parameters that we had
 
01:38:35.350 --> 01:38:35.360 align:start position:0%
with the hundred thousand we were able
 
01:38:37.350 --> 01:38:37.360 align:start position:0%
to pay for almost all of our ap
 
01:38:39.350 --> 01:38:39.360 align:start position:0%
not just our economically disadvantaged
 
01:38:41.510 --> 01:38:41.520 align:start position:0%
kids and the fifty thousand dollars will
 
01:38:43.109 --> 01:38:43.119 align:start position:0%
allow us to meet mission of paying for
 
01:38:44.950 --> 01:38:44.960 align:start position:0%
economically disadvantaged kids that
 
01:38:53.830 --> 01:38:53.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:38:56.950 --> 01:38:56.960 align:start position:0%
okay so the 50
 
01:39:00.550 --> 01:39:00.560 align:start position:0%
000 in each year
 
01:39:04.149 --> 01:39:04.159 align:start position:0%
is basically to pay for
 
01:39:07.270 --> 01:39:07.280 align:start position:0%
the advanced placement test exactly the
 
01:39:10.830 --> 01:39:10.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:10.840 --> 01:39:18.390 align:start position:0%
 
yep

01:39:18.390 --> 01:39:18.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:20.790 --> 01:39:20.800 align:start position:0%
do the when do those tests take place at
 
01:39:22.229 --> 01:39:22.239 align:start position:0%
the end of the school year
 
01:39:25.270 --> 01:39:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:29.350 --> 01:39:29.360 align:start position:0%
okay and who provides who
 
01:39:33.030 --> 01:39:33.040 align:start position:0%
who provides the tests so the test is
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
um administered in the school but it's a
 
01:39:36.229 --> 01:39:36.239 align:start position:0%
college board test
 
01:39:40.310 --> 01:39:40.320 align:start position:0%
so it's by sap by college board
 
01:39:44.550 --> 01:39:44.560 align:start position:0%
okay so if i'm taking um
 
01:39:48.629 --> 01:39:48.639 align:start position:0%
advanced calculus which i
 
01:39:51.510 --> 01:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
i'm lucky i can add one and one but if
 
01:39:53.830 --> 01:39:53.840 align:start position:0%
i'm taking advanced calculus
 
01:39:59.430 --> 01:39:59.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:02.950 --> 01:40:02.960 align:start position:0%
the college board to get that test
 
01:40:05.590 --> 01:40:05.600 align:start position:0%
so the student would and generally it's
 
01:40:07.189 --> 01:40:07.199 align:start position:0%
done through their ap teacher the
 
01:40:07.990 --> 01:40:08.000 align:start position:0%
student would sign
 
01:40:10.550 --> 01:40:10.560 align:start position:0%
up to take the test right so that the
 
01:40:12.070 --> 01:40:12.080 align:start position:0%
school is teaching the ap
 
01:40:14.310 --> 01:40:14.320 align:start position:0%
class all year long and then they get
 
01:40:16.550 --> 01:40:16.560 align:start position:0%
towards the end and the student says i'm
 
01:40:17.669 --> 01:40:17.679 align:start position:0%
going to take the ap
 
01:40:20.790 --> 01:40:20.800 align:start position:0%
test so the student would sign up and
 
01:40:23.270 --> 01:40:23.280 align:start position:0%
that student would be required to pay a
 
01:40:24.629 --> 01:40:24.639 align:start position:0%
fee to
 
01:40:27.990 --> 01:40:28.000 align:start position:0%
um college board but we get a roster
 
01:40:29.510 --> 01:40:29.520 align:start position:0%
from the schools of the
 
01:40:32.229 --> 01:40:32.239 align:start position:0%
qualified students and so we pay
 
01:40:34.229 --> 01:40:34.239 align:start position:0%
directly to college board
 
01:40:36.870 --> 01:40:36.880 align:start position:0%
the tuition for those qualified students
 
01:40:40.550 --> 01:40:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:43.910 --> 01:40:43.920 align:start position:0%
do we know what is this a straight fee
 
01:40:43.920 --> 01:40:44.310 align:start position:0%
do we know what is this a straight fee
for

01:40:44.310 --> 01:40:44.320 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:40:48.149 --> 01:40:48.159 align:start position:0%
the same for all classes all courses
 
01:40:51.669 --> 01:40:51.679 align:start position:0%
i believe it is yes okay
 
01:40:56.390 --> 01:40:56.400 align:start position:0%
he's like 84 80 84
 
01:40:56.400 --> 01:41:03.109 align:start position:0%
he's like 84 80 84
okay

01:41:03.109 --> 01:41:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:06.629 --> 01:41:06.639 align:start position:0%
okay i know
 
01:41:09.750 --> 01:41:09.760 align:start position:0%
you guys shouldn't give me um
 
01:41:11.430 --> 01:41:11.440 align:start position:0%
i'm gonna actually have to jump off in
 
01:41:12.950 --> 01:41:12.960 align:start position:0%
about two minutes i just want to let you
 
01:41:13.510 --> 01:41:13.520 align:start position:0%
know that
 
01:41:16.629 --> 01:41:16.639 align:start position:0%
then okay okay
 
01:41:22.310 --> 01:41:22.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:25.990 --> 01:41:26.000 align:start position:0%
i'm going to the cte program
 
01:41:30.830 --> 01:41:30.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:30.840 --> 01:41:32.910 align:start position:0%
 
page

01:41:32.910 --> 01:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
page
 
01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:39.430 align:start position:0%
page
1266

01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:42.870 --> 01:41:42.880 align:start position:0%
and and 1267
 
01:41:46.550 --> 01:41:46.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:50.080 align:start position:0%
eliminated the money for the dropout
 
01:41:50.080 --> 01:41:53.270 align:start position:0%
eliminated the money for the dropout
prevention

01:41:53.270 --> 01:41:53.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:58.550 --> 01:41:58.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:02.159 align:start position:0%
i am obviously uh
 
01:42:05.510 --> 01:42:05.520 align:start position:0%
somewhat concerned did we put it in
 
01:42:06.550 --> 01:42:06.560 align:start position:0%
someplace else
 
01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:10.080 align:start position:0%
or so we did not uh rep on burger that
 
01:42:11.189 --> 01:42:11.199 align:start position:0%
was one of the
 
01:42:12.629 --> 01:42:12.639 align:start position:0%
decisions that we made through the
 
01:42:14.310 --> 01:42:14.320 align:start position:0%
budget process
 
01:42:17.669 --> 01:42:17.679 align:start position:0%
um and i think i um may have alluded to
 
01:42:19.430 --> 01:42:19.440 align:start position:0%
this previously but just let me refresh
 
01:42:21.030 --> 01:42:21.040 align:start position:0%
kind of lunch because again we're trying
 
01:42:22.229 --> 01:42:22.239 align:start position:0%
to meet our budget
 
01:42:24.070 --> 01:42:24.080 align:start position:0%
so we're trying to figure out where we
 
01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:26.480 align:start position:0%
can make reductions and where we cannot
 
01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:29.920 align:start position:0%
and so my choice for this program
 
01:42:31.910 --> 01:42:31.920 align:start position:0%
really stems from the fact that this
 
01:42:34.470 --> 01:42:34.480 align:start position:0%
came into fruition back i think in 2008
 
01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.910 align:start position:0%
came into fruition back i think in 2008
2009

01:42:35.910 --> 01:42:35.920 align:start position:0%
2009
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
uh where the state saw a high drop out
 
01:42:40.950 --> 01:42:40.960 align:start position:0%
rate that they were uncomfortable with
 
01:42:42.310 --> 01:42:42.320 align:start position:0%
and wanting to do some type of an
 
01:42:42.320 --> 01:42:43.910 align:start position:0%
and wanting to do some type of an
intervention

01:42:43.910 --> 01:42:43.920 align:start position:0%
intervention
 
01:42:45.750 --> 01:42:45.760 align:start position:0%
the circumstances on the ground today
 
01:42:47.189 --> 01:42:47.199 align:start position:0%
are not that we
 
01:42:49.030 --> 01:42:49.040 align:start position:0%
do a good job making sure through a
 
01:42:50.550 --> 01:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
variety of different programs
 
01:42:52.149 --> 01:42:52.159 align:start position:0%
that we don't have a high dropout rate
 
01:42:53.669 --> 01:42:53.679 align:start position:0%
and that many of our students stay
 
01:42:57.109 --> 01:42:57.119 align:start position:0%
in school and so it's almost like
 
01:42:59.590 --> 01:42:59.600 align:start position:0%
end of life we started a program it was
 
01:43:01.590 --> 01:43:01.600 align:start position:0%
successful we were able to
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
see reductions in our dropout rate we
 
01:43:05.350 --> 01:43:05.360 align:start position:0%
were able to meet the goal of the
 
01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:06.149 align:start position:0%
were able to meet the goal of the
program

01:43:06.149 --> 01:43:06.159 align:start position:0%
program
 
01:43:08.390 --> 01:43:08.400 align:start position:0%
and accomplishment accomplish it and so
 
01:43:10.470 --> 01:43:10.480 align:start position:0%
then rather than have kind of that
 
01:43:12.229 --> 01:43:12.239 align:start position:0%
classic government program that never
 
01:43:13.669 --> 01:43:13.679 align:start position:0%
ends this one
 
01:43:15.590 --> 01:43:15.600 align:start position:0%
of the different programs that we had
 
01:43:17.030 --> 01:43:17.040 align:start position:0%
appears to have
 
01:43:19.750 --> 01:43:19.760 align:start position:0%
uh more so than not met mission and
 
01:43:20.390 --> 01:43:20.400 align:start position:0%
would be
 
01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:23.040 align:start position:0%
a good place to redirect those resources
 
01:43:25.830 --> 01:43:25.840 align:start position:0%
at something else potentially
 
01:43:30.550 --> 01:43:30.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:32.310 --> 01:43:32.320 align:start position:0%
yeah can you say a little bit more about
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
that because i mean there was a
 
01:43:36.390 --> 01:43:36.400 align:start position:0%
time i think it was new jersey decided
 
01:43:38.390 --> 01:43:38.400 align:start position:0%
well we don't have polio anymore so
 
01:43:40.629 --> 01:43:40.639 align:start position:0%
we're going to get rid of the vaccine
 
01:43:42.550 --> 01:43:42.560 align:start position:0%
which is you know kind of you don't have
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
polio because you have a vaccine
 
01:43:46.149 --> 01:43:46.159 align:start position:0%
so can you speak a little bit more about
 
01:43:48.709 --> 01:43:48.719 align:start position:0%
getting rid of this program
 
01:43:50.709 --> 01:43:50.719 align:start position:0%
one might speculate that the dropout
 
01:43:52.790 --> 01:43:52.800 align:start position:0%
rate would thereby increase
 
01:43:54.550 --> 01:43:54.560 align:start position:0%
so one of the things you know we would
 
01:43:56.229 --> 01:43:56.239 align:start position:0%
hope that it wouldn't increase
 
01:43:57.750 --> 01:43:57.760 align:start position:0%
uh but probably one of the things that
 
01:43:59.669 --> 01:43:59.679 align:start position:0%
has been most impactful over the years
 
01:44:01.430 --> 01:44:01.440 align:start position:0%
on dropout prevention was really an
 
01:44:03.189 --> 01:44:03.199 align:start position:0%
action of the legislature so
 
01:44:05.109 --> 01:44:05.119 align:start position:0%
when they increased compulsory education
 
01:44:06.550 --> 01:44:06.560 align:start position:0%
to 18.
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
so now the students are in school until
 
01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:09.910 align:start position:0%
so now the students are in school until
18

01:44:09.910 --> 01:44:09.920 align:start position:0%
18
 
01:44:12.550 --> 01:44:12.560 align:start position:0%
and that affords them a runway and
 
01:44:14.550 --> 01:44:14.560 align:start position:0%
latitude for the schools to be able to
 
01:44:16.310 --> 01:44:16.320 align:start position:0%
work with them to be able to help them
 
01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:17.350 align:start position:0%
work with them to be able to help them
navigate

01:44:17.350 --> 01:44:17.360 align:start position:0%
navigate
 
01:44:20.390 --> 01:44:20.400 align:start position:0%
through to their high school diploma and
 
01:44:22.470 --> 01:44:22.480 align:start position:0%
then the other program that
 
01:44:24.390 --> 01:44:24.400 align:start position:0%
you have supported that legislature has
 
01:44:26.550 --> 01:44:26.560 align:start position:0%
supported consistently over the years
 
01:44:28.870 --> 01:44:28.880 align:start position:0%
that has made a significant difference
 
01:44:30.629 --> 01:44:30.639 align:start position:0%
in terms of our dropouts is our adult
 
01:44:32.709 --> 01:44:32.719 align:start position:0%
education programming
 
01:44:35.510 --> 01:44:35.520 align:start position:0%
our adult ed programs serve many of
 
01:44:35.520 --> 01:44:35.910 align:start position:0%
our adult ed programs serve many of
these

01:44:35.910 --> 01:44:35.920 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:44:39.270 --> 01:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
at-risk students and by doing so
 
01:44:41.109 --> 01:44:41.119 align:start position:0%
keep them engaged and are able to bring
 
01:44:43.910 --> 01:44:43.920 align:start position:0%
them through to a high school diploma
 
01:44:45.910 --> 01:44:45.920 align:start position:0%
at relatively significant numbers we
 
01:44:48.070 --> 01:44:48.080 align:start position:0%
have about 1400 students across the
 
01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:49.270 align:start position:0%
have about 1400 students across the
state

01:44:49.270 --> 01:44:49.280 align:start position:0%
state
 
01:44:51.350 --> 01:44:51.360 align:start position:0%
who are between the ages of 16 and 18
 
01:44:54.149 --> 01:44:54.159 align:start position:0%
involved in our adult education program
 
01:44:55.910 --> 01:44:55.920 align:start position:0%
and then the third event that has taken
 
01:44:57.590 --> 01:44:57.600 align:start position:0%
place over the last decade since this
 
01:44:59.350 --> 01:44:59.360 align:start position:0%
was first put in place really is
 
01:45:01.910 --> 01:45:01.920 align:start position:0%
i would point to many of our charter
 
01:45:01.920 --> 01:45:02.870 align:start position:0%
i would point to many of our charter
schools

01:45:02.870 --> 01:45:02.880 align:start position:0%
schools
 
01:45:04.310 --> 01:45:04.320 align:start position:0%
i believe it's about eight of our
 
01:45:06.390 --> 01:45:06.400 align:start position:0%
charter schools are specifically
 
01:45:07.830 --> 01:45:07.840 align:start position:0%
targeted at at-risk
 
01:45:09.910 --> 01:45:09.920 align:start position:0%
students so these are charter schools
 
01:45:11.990 --> 01:45:12.000 align:start position:0%
that are in place in order to help those
 
01:45:13.430 --> 01:45:13.440 align:start position:0%
kids who are at risk
 
01:45:15.590 --> 01:45:15.600 align:start position:0%
and work specifically with them and so
 
01:45:17.669 --> 01:45:17.679 align:start position:0%
probably it's a combination of it was
 
01:45:18.950 --> 01:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
appropriate at the time we got this
 
01:45:20.070 --> 01:45:20.080 align:start position:0%
program started
 
01:45:21.830 --> 01:45:21.840 align:start position:0%
you start making a dent there's been
 
01:45:23.430 --> 01:45:23.440 align:start position:0%
some other policy decisions over the
 
01:45:24.310 --> 01:45:24.320 align:start position:0%
last decade
 
01:45:26.149 --> 01:45:26.159 align:start position:0%
that seem to have made a significant
 
01:45:26.159 --> 01:45:27.590 align:start position:0%
that seem to have made a significant
impact

01:45:27.590 --> 01:45:27.600 align:start position:0%
impact
 
01:45:29.590 --> 01:45:29.600 align:start position:0%
and therefore that's why we find
 
01:45:30.709 --> 01:45:30.719 align:start position:0%
ourselves where we are today i don't
 
01:45:31.750 --> 01:45:31.760 align:start position:0%
know if that helps you but
 
01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:36.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:45:40.229 --> 01:45:40.239 align:start position:0%
okay um this is moving on to
 
01:45:41.590 --> 01:45:41.600 align:start position:0%
i'm going to have to jump out rep on
 
01:45:43.109 --> 01:45:43.119 align:start position:0%
burger i apologize i have a quote
 
01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:44.320 align:start position:0%
there's school leaders that knew and i
 
01:45:46.229 --> 01:45:46.239 align:start position:0%
need to be honest so
 
01:45:49.270 --> 01:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
no problem okay guys
 
01:45:50.709 --> 01:45:50.719 align:start position:0%
somebody will be able to answer the
 
01:45:52.709 --> 01:45:52.719 align:start position:0%
questions um
 
01:45:55.990 --> 01:45:56.000 align:start position:0%
this is on adult education
 
01:45:59.669 --> 01:45:59.679 align:start position:0%
and i noticed that the federal funds
 
01:46:03.270 --> 01:46:03.280 align:start position:0%
are like 2.2 and 2.3
 
01:46:06.790 --> 01:46:06.800 align:start position:0%
but when we look at the state funds
 
01:46:11.830 --> 01:46:11.840 align:start position:0%
it's costing us 4.1
 
01:46:15.189 --> 01:46:15.199 align:start position:0%
million and
 
01:46:18.390 --> 01:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
i guess that my real question is why
 
01:46:20.870 --> 01:46:20.880 align:start position:0%
does it cost the state twice as much as
 
01:46:27.030 --> 01:46:27.040 align:start position:0%
the grant
 
01:46:29.750 --> 01:46:29.760 align:start position:0%
um so my understanding of that program
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
is that we are required to provide
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
a match and as
 
01:46:37.750 --> 01:46:37.760 align:start position:0%
we have provided more match throughout
 
01:46:39.830 --> 01:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
the years now we're at a level of
 
01:46:39.840 --> 01:46:40.629 align:start position:0%
the years now we're at a level of
requiring

01:46:40.629 --> 01:46:40.639 align:start position:0%
requiring
 
01:46:42.390 --> 01:46:42.400 align:start position:0%
that match and maintaining that
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort
 
01:46:45.510 --> 01:46:45.520 align:start position:0%
and if we don't maintain that
 
01:46:47.510 --> 01:46:47.520 align:start position:0%
maintenance of effort then we lose the
 
01:46:49.510 --> 01:46:49.520 align:start position:0%
federal funds on
 
01:46:52.149 --> 01:46:52.159 align:start position:0%
as well as if we reduce the state funds
 
01:46:54.149 --> 01:46:54.159 align:start position:0%
then we end up losing the federal funds
 
01:46:56.390 --> 01:46:56.400 align:start position:0%
so it is a high maintenance of effort i
 
01:46:57.510 --> 01:46:57.520 align:start position:0%
do agree
 
01:47:01.350 --> 01:47:01.360 align:start position:0%
um unfortunately we've kind of set that
 
01:47:13.430 --> 01:47:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:20.149 align:start position:0%
 
so

01:47:20.149 --> 01:47:20.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
are we making giant strides with adult
 
01:47:23.600 --> 01:47:27.109 align:start position:0%
are we making giant strides with adult
education

01:47:27.109 --> 01:47:27.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:47:29.830 --> 01:47:29.840 align:start position:0%
uh i i guess that that would be a
 
01:47:32.070 --> 01:47:32.080 align:start position:0%
programmatic question i would have to
 
01:47:34.870 --> 01:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
defer to the program administrator on
 
01:47:34.880 --> 01:47:35.270 align:start position:0%
defer to the program administrator on
that

01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:47:37.830 --> 01:47:37.840 align:start position:0%
um i i would think that she would say
 
01:47:37.840 --> 01:47:38.310 align:start position:0%
um i i would think that she would say
yes

01:47:38.310 --> 01:47:38.320 align:start position:0%
yes
 
01:47:41.750 --> 01:47:41.760 align:start position:0%
it is a very helpful program um but
 
01:47:45.109 --> 01:47:45.119 align:start position:0%
i can always ask her to
 
01:47:46.870 --> 01:47:46.880 align:start position:0%
answer the question and get back to you
 
01:47:48.870 --> 01:47:48.880 align:start position:0%
if that's what you'd like
 
01:47:51.270 --> 01:47:51.280 align:start position:0%
i i would have i would appreciate that
 
01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:52.070 align:start position:0%
i i would have i would appreciate that
because

01:47:52.070 --> 01:47:52.080 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:47:54.790 --> 01:47:54.800 align:start position:0%
uh and i guess that the the other half
 
01:47:55.990 --> 01:47:56.000 align:start position:0%
of the question is
 
01:47:59.430 --> 01:47:59.440 align:start position:0%
is how much of this adult education
 
01:47:59.440 --> 01:48:00.310 align:start position:0%
is how much of this adult education
money

01:48:00.310 --> 01:48:00.320 align:start position:0%
money
 
01:48:03.510 --> 01:48:03.520 align:start position:0%
is going to the children that
 
01:48:07.270 --> 01:48:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh commissioner edelblue talked about
 
01:48:11.030 --> 01:48:11.040 align:start position:0%
as being in an adult head
 
01:48:14.310 --> 01:48:14.320 align:start position:0%
i mean i can tell you that our adult ed
 
01:48:15.270 --> 01:48:15.280 align:start position:0%
program here
 
01:48:19.910 --> 01:48:19.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:23.270 --> 01:48:23.280 align:start position:0%
not very robust and um
 
01:48:26.629 --> 01:48:26.639 align:start position:0%
but what is robust is the kids that are
 
01:48:31.430 --> 01:48:31.440 align:start position:0%

understanding about
 
01:48:44.310 --> 01:48:44.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:53.910 --> 01:48:53.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:56.950 --> 01:48:56.960 align:start position:0%
sorry i'm so full of questions but this
 
01:48:58.830 --> 01:48:58.840 align:start position:0%
is a
 
01:49:01.669 --> 01:49:01.679 align:start position:0%
extremely interesting
 
01:49:05.750 --> 01:49:05.760 align:start position:0%
um budget
 
01:49:07.669 --> 01:49:07.679 align:start position:0%
a lot of their own so you're helping me
 
01:49:09.910 --> 01:49:09.920 align:start position:0%
just go through this too
 
01:49:12.709 --> 01:49:12.719 align:start position:0%
oh i'm letting you flag it i don't need
 
01:49:14.629 --> 01:49:14.639 align:start position:0%
to this is great
 
01:49:19.350 --> 01:49:19.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:22.390 --> 01:49:22.400 align:start position:0%
now i'm on page 12
 
01:49:25.990 --> 01:49:26.000 align:start position:0%
79 and
 
01:49:29.189 --> 01:49:29.199 align:start position:0%
this is
 
01:49:32.229 --> 01:49:32.239 align:start position:0%
vocational this is the workforce
 
01:49:34.950 --> 01:49:34.960 align:start position:0%
innovation innovation
 
01:49:39.350 --> 01:49:39.360 align:start position:0%
and the uh vocational rehab
 
01:49:43.430 --> 01:49:43.440 align:start position:0%
this is this is for the people
 
01:49:47.669 --> 01:49:47.679 align:start position:0%
that have some sort of
 
01:49:51.510 --> 01:49:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:56.149 --> 01:49:56.159 align:start position:0%
that okay that are that the state the
 
01:49:57.830 --> 01:49:57.840 align:start position:0%
state provides
 
01:50:01.430 --> 01:50:01.440 align:start position:0%
money for their education
 
01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:03.840 align:start position:0%
um it's to help them get back to the
 
01:50:08.830 --> 01:50:08.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:12.229 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:50:12.229 --> 01:50:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:15.510 --> 01:50:15.520 align:start position:0%
and this is that 3.4 million dollars is
 
01:50:17.589 --> 01:50:17.599 align:start position:0%
the state match that is required
 
01:50:19.270 --> 01:50:19.280 align:start position:0%
oh christine you're there would you like
 
01:50:21.510 --> 01:50:21.520 align:start position:0%
to talk about the vr program
 
01:50:24.149 --> 01:50:24.159 align:start position:0%
yep that is exactly right it's a it's a
 
01:50:24.870 --> 01:50:24.880 align:start position:0%
program for
 
01:50:27.910 --> 01:50:27.920 align:start position:0%
students as well as adults that
 
01:50:30.709 --> 01:50:30.719 align:start position:0%
people who are disabled or perhaps maybe
 
01:50:32.709 --> 01:50:32.719 align:start position:0%
had some sort of injury that occurred in
 
01:50:34.390 --> 01:50:34.400 align:start position:0%
their lifetime
 
01:50:37.910 --> 01:50:37.920 align:start position:0%
our counselors do work with individuals
 
01:50:39.669 --> 01:50:39.679 align:start position:0%
to find pathways that they can be
 
01:50:47.430 --> 01:50:47.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:50.149 --> 01:50:50.159 align:start position:0%
how how does oh i'm sorry representative
 
01:50:51.910 --> 01:50:51.920 align:start position:0%
maria have a question no
 
01:50:53.270 --> 01:50:53.280 align:start position:0%
you can keep going i can always wait but
 
01:50:55.669 --> 01:50:55.679 align:start position:0%
i was going to ask if you have
 
01:50:58.870 --> 01:50:58.880 align:start position:0%
um i don't know a return on you know you
 
01:50:59.910 --> 01:50:59.920 align:start position:0%
get these people back
 
01:51:02.070 --> 01:51:02.080 align:start position:0%
into the workforce a return on the i
 
01:51:03.430 --> 01:51:03.440 align:start position:0%
guess return on investment
 
01:51:06.629 --> 01:51:06.639 align:start position:0%
is the standard phrase of
 
01:51:08.310 --> 01:51:08.320 align:start position:0%
how much we get back for helping these
 
01:51:13.430 --> 01:51:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
i don't have an actual number but i can
 
01:51:17.750 --> 01:51:17.760 align:start position:0%
i can figure that out but i know that we
 
01:51:19.189 --> 01:51:19.199 align:start position:0%
have um
 
01:51:22.070 --> 01:51:22.080 align:start position:0%
changed our programs up so that that um
 
01:51:22.080 --> 01:51:22.629 align:start position:0%
changed our programs up so that that um
the

01:51:22.629 --> 01:51:22.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:51:25.589 --> 01:51:25.599 align:start position:0%
employees that kind of connect them with
 
01:51:27.350 --> 01:51:27.360 align:start position:0%
the workforce they'll have things like
 
01:51:29.510 --> 01:51:29.520 align:start position:0%
the longer that they're in a job
 
01:51:33.270 --> 01:51:33.280 align:start position:0%
the benefits that they get um insurance
 
01:51:34.790 --> 01:51:34.800 align:start position:0%
there's an increase with some of our
 
01:51:36.550 --> 01:51:36.560 align:start position:0%
contractors and their pay because we
 
01:51:37.109 --> 01:51:37.119 align:start position:0%
want to
 
01:51:39.030 --> 01:51:39.040 align:start position:0%
have them have be successful in the
 
01:51:43.189 --> 01:51:43.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:45.030 --> 01:51:45.040 align:start position:0%
how does oh did you have another
 
01:51:54.470 --> 01:51:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:57.750 --> 01:51:57.760 align:start position:0%
you're you're muted ma'am okay
 
01:51:59.750 --> 01:51:59.760 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry i thought i had pressed that
 
01:52:01.430 --> 01:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
hard enough uh
 
01:52:04.070 --> 01:52:04.080 align:start position:0%
how does this program interact with uh
 
01:52:06.550 --> 01:52:06.560 align:start position:0%
the health and human services programs
 
01:52:09.510 --> 01:52:09.520 align:start position:0%
that are out there for these uh these
 
01:52:12.629 --> 01:52:12.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:15.669 --> 01:52:15.679 align:start position:0%
so i believe that some of the um one in
 
01:52:15.679 --> 01:52:16.149 align:start position:0%
so i believe that some of the um one in
one

01:52:16.149 --> 01:52:16.159 align:start position:0%
one
 
01:52:19.910 --> 01:52:19.920 align:start position:0%
of the ways they support um in the iep
 
01:52:19.920 --> 01:52:20.629 align:start position:0%
of the ways they support um in the iep
meetings

01:52:20.629 --> 01:52:20.639 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
01:52:23.669 --> 01:52:23.679 align:start position:0%
we make sure that they have
 
01:52:25.830 --> 01:52:25.840 align:start position:0%
long-term like that there's counseling
 
01:52:26.790 --> 01:52:26.800 align:start position:0%
going on so that
 
01:52:28.629 --> 01:52:28.639 align:start position:0%
if they're new if there's long-term
 
01:52:30.870 --> 01:52:30.880 align:start position:0%
supports needed
 
01:52:33.109 --> 01:52:33.119 align:start position:0%
it is discussed in the iep meeting and
 
01:52:34.470 --> 01:52:34.480 align:start position:0%
then the department of health and human
 
01:52:36.229 --> 01:52:36.239 align:start position:0%
services can then
 
01:52:38.629 --> 01:52:38.639 align:start position:0%
know how many students or how many folks
 
01:52:40.870 --> 01:52:40.880 align:start position:0%
might be in that same category
 
01:52:43.589 --> 01:52:43.599 align:start position:0%
so that's one way in which vr works with
 
01:52:48.629 --> 01:52:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:53.030 --> 01:52:53.040 align:start position:0%
i've always worried about duplication of
 
01:52:56.870 --> 01:52:56.880 align:start position:0%
of services and finances
 
01:52:59.510 --> 01:52:59.520 align:start position:0%
between health and human services and
 
01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:00.870 align:start position:0%
between health and human services and
doe

01:53:00.870 --> 01:53:00.880 align:start position:0%
doe
 
01:53:03.510 --> 01:53:03.520 align:start position:0%
but that's i guess that's going to
 
01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:03.990 align:start position:0%
but that's i guess that's going to
happen

01:53:03.990 --> 01:53:04.000 align:start position:0%
happen
 
01:53:08.229 --> 01:53:08.239 align:start position:0%
so i i was i was mainly concerned if you
 
01:53:08.239 --> 01:53:08.470 align:start position:0%
so i i was i was mainly concerned if you
are

01:53:08.470 --> 01:53:08.480 align:start position:0%
are
 
01:53:11.669 --> 01:53:11.679 align:start position:0%
in fact engaging
 
01:53:13.589 --> 01:53:13.599 align:start position:0%
with the folks at health and human
 
01:53:15.589 --> 01:53:15.599 align:start position:0%
services because
 
01:53:19.030 --> 01:53:19.040 align:start position:0%
you know that they've already
 
01:53:23.189 --> 01:53:23.199 align:start position:0%
if the child is over 20
 
01:53:26.229 --> 01:53:26.239 align:start position:0%
21 is that the at the cutoff age
 
01:53:29.910 --> 01:53:29.920 align:start position:0%
if the child is over 21 or the person
 
01:53:33.589 --> 01:53:33.599 align:start position:0%
is over 21 then uh you know health and
 
01:53:35.109 --> 01:53:35.119 align:start position:0%
human services
 
01:53:38.070 --> 01:53:38.080 align:start position:0%
picks it up and i just wanted to be sure
 
01:53:39.510 --> 01:53:39.520 align:start position:0%
that the education
 
01:53:42.950 --> 01:53:42.960 align:start position:0%
part of it is interwoven
 
01:53:46.229 --> 01:53:46.239 align:start position:0%
into whatever their either
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
past iep or current is uh
 
01:53:52.870 --> 01:53:52.880 align:start position:0%
is working on you're absolutely correct
 
01:53:54.470 --> 01:53:54.480 align:start position:0%
and i think one of the how we
 
01:53:57.270 --> 01:53:57.280 align:start position:0%
work with some of coordination is we
 
01:53:58.629 --> 01:53:58.639 align:start position:0%
want to make sure that department health
 
01:54:00.310 --> 01:54:00.320 align:start position:0%
and human services know who these
 
01:54:00.320 --> 01:54:00.790 align:start position:0%
and human services know who these
students

01:54:00.790 --> 01:54:00.800 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:54:03.830 --> 01:54:03.840 align:start position:0%
are because if not there are a lot of
 
01:54:07.189 --> 01:54:07.199 align:start position:0%
students who can't get services till
 
01:54:10.229 --> 01:54:10.239 align:start position:0%
a young till an older age so we
 
01:54:11.910 --> 01:54:11.920 align:start position:0%
make sure that they know that the
 
01:54:13.589 --> 01:54:13.599 align:start position:0%
coordination is happening at the iep
 
01:54:13.599 --> 01:54:14.310 align:start position:0%
coordination is happening at the iep
meeting

01:54:14.310 --> 01:54:14.320 align:start position:0%
meeting
 
01:54:15.750 --> 01:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
and they even talk about the planning
 
01:54:17.510 --> 01:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
happening in the sophomore year
 
01:54:19.430 --> 01:54:19.440 align:start position:0%
so that by the time their seniors
 
01:54:20.790 --> 01:54:20.800 align:start position:0%
department health and human service
 
01:54:21.830 --> 01:54:21.840 align:start position:0%
folks know that
 
01:54:25.750 --> 01:54:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:28.790 --> 01:54:28.800 align:start position:0%
right but the school system picks it up
 
01:54:31.910 --> 01:54:31.920 align:start position:0%
until they're 21 and
 
01:54:35.510 --> 01:54:35.520 align:start position:0%
um and so but
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
you work with children
 
01:54:43.109 --> 01:54:43.119 align:start position:0%
that are um under 21 as well is that
 
01:54:43.119 --> 01:54:44.390 align:start position:0%
that are um under 21 as well is that
correct

01:54:44.390 --> 01:54:44.400 align:start position:0%
correct
 
01:54:48.790 --> 01:54:48.800 align:start position:0%
yes yep and we have sts counselors in
 
01:54:50.229 --> 01:54:50.239 align:start position:0%
the department
 
01:54:52.790 --> 01:54:52.800 align:start position:0%
that are in our vocational um rehab we
 
01:54:55.030 --> 01:54:55.040 align:start position:0%
kind of restructure it so there's five
 
01:54:58.390 --> 01:54:58.400 align:start position:0%
we call them sts counselors to make sure
 
01:54:59.910 --> 01:54:59.920 align:start position:0%
that they're getting attention
 
01:55:01.910 --> 01:55:01.920 align:start position:0%
that they're that they have a pathway
 
01:55:03.030 --> 01:55:03.040 align:start position:0%
after school
 
01:55:04.870 --> 01:55:04.880 align:start position:0%
and so some of the students go right
 
01:55:06.229 --> 01:55:06.239 align:start position:0%
into the workforce
 
01:55:08.709 --> 01:55:08.719 align:start position:0%
and then some of them um depending on
 
01:55:10.390 --> 01:55:10.400 align:start position:0%
how complicated the issues are
 
01:55:13.030 --> 01:55:13.040 align:start position:0%
would be passed on maybe or working with
 
01:55:16.470 --> 01:55:16.480 align:start position:0%
department health and human services
 
01:55:19.750 --> 01:55:19.760 align:start position:0%
okay are there any questions there
 
01:55:23.350 --> 01:55:23.360 align:start position:0%
all right uh seeing none let's go
 
01:55:26.470 --> 01:55:26.480 align:start position:0%
over to um the uh
 
01:55:33.990 --> 01:55:34.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:37.109 --> 01:55:37.119 align:start position:0%
um i got sarah wheeler on if you'd like
 
01:55:40.790 --> 01:55:40.800 align:start position:0%
to go back to that adult ed question
 
01:55:43.830 --> 01:55:43.840 align:start position:0%
oh sure that'd be fine um can you
 
01:55:45.910 --> 01:55:45.920 align:start position:0%
phrase the question to her so she can
 
01:55:47.430 --> 01:55:47.440 align:start position:0%
have the context
 
01:55:53.750 --> 01:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:56.390 --> 01:55:56.400 align:start position:0%
sarah i was i was talking about the
 
01:55:57.510 --> 01:55:57.520 align:start position:0%
adult ed
 
01:56:01.430 --> 01:56:01.440 align:start position:0%
program and uh the
 
01:56:06.070 --> 01:56:06.080 align:start position:0%
the dollars obviously which is uh what i
 
01:56:09.270 --> 01:56:09.280 align:start position:0%
what i was concerned about
 
01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:12.470 align:start position:0%
what i was concerned about
but

01:56:12.470 --> 01:56:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:56:16.229 --> 01:56:16.239 align:start position:0%
i'm not i'm not sure
 
01:56:19.510 --> 01:56:19.520 align:start position:0%
how successful the adult ed program
 
01:56:22.629 --> 01:56:22.639 align:start position:0%
is in the state
 
01:56:25.990 --> 01:56:26.000 align:start position:0%
and that um we
 
01:56:28.070 --> 01:56:28.080 align:start position:0%
we have quite a bit of money focused on
 
01:56:28.080 --> 01:56:29.189 align:start position:0%
we have quite a bit of money focused on
it

01:56:29.189 --> 01:56:29.199 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:56:32.229 --> 01:56:32.239 align:start position:0%
and yet uh
 
01:56:36.310 --> 01:56:36.320 align:start position:0%
i see mary but i i'm just
 
01:56:39.430 --> 01:56:39.440 align:start position:0%
i just am you know
 
01:56:41.109 --> 01:56:41.119 align:start position:0%
obviously i don't want to eliminate the
 
01:56:43.189 --> 01:56:43.199 align:start position:0%
program that's not
 
01:56:47.750 --> 01:56:47.760 align:start position:0%
that's not what my what my goal is but
 
01:56:51.430 --> 01:56:51.440 align:start position:0%
i think we have been more successful
 
01:56:54.790 --> 01:56:54.800 align:start position:0%
at the um
 
01:56:57.040 --> 01:56:57.050 align:start position:0%
high school level
 
01:56:57.050 --> 01:56:58.550 align:start position:0%
high school level
[Music]

01:56:58.550 --> 01:56:58.560 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:57:01.669 --> 01:57:01.679 align:start position:0%
with the adult education program than we
 
01:57:01.679 --> 01:57:02.229 align:start position:0%
with the adult education program than we
have

01:57:02.229 --> 01:57:02.239 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:57:05.830 --> 01:57:05.840 align:start position:0%
with adults and so i'm
 
01:57:09.189 --> 01:57:09.199 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to uh to come to grips
 
01:57:09.199 --> 01:57:12.390 align:start position:0%
i'm just trying to uh to come to grips
with

01:57:12.390 --> 01:57:12.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:14.550 --> 01:57:14.560 align:start position:0%
are we focusing on the right kinds of
 
01:57:15.669 --> 01:57:15.679 align:start position:0%
things that
 
01:57:21.430 --> 01:57:21.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:24.470 --> 01:57:24.480 align:start position:0%
so adult education runs
 
01:57:26.709 --> 01:57:26.719 align:start position:0%
two different types of programs one of
 
01:57:28.550 --> 01:57:28.560 align:start position:0%
them is under the workforce innovations
 
01:57:30.149 --> 01:57:30.159 align:start position:0%
and opportunities act
 
01:57:31.990 --> 01:57:32.000 align:start position:0%
which is the workforce development and
 
01:57:34.229 --> 01:57:34.239 align:start position:0%
that is for anybody who is not
 
01:57:36.550 --> 01:57:36.560 align:start position:0%
enrolled in school or not required to be
 
01:57:37.669 --> 01:57:37.679 align:start position:0%
enrolled in school
 
01:57:39.510 --> 01:57:39.520 align:start position:0%
so in that program we don't serve
 
01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:43.599 align:start position:0%
anybody under the age of 18.
 
01:57:46.629 --> 01:57:46.639 align:start position:0%
is that excuse me is that in cooperation
 
01:57:49.669 --> 01:57:49.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:53.109 --> 01:57:53.119 align:start position:0%
the unemployment folks yes so
 
01:57:56.149 --> 01:57:56.159 align:start position:0%
we are a core partner um title two is
 
01:57:57.910 --> 01:57:57.920 align:start position:0%
one of the four titles in
 
01:57:59.109 --> 01:57:59.119 align:start position:0%
the workforce innovations and
 
01:58:01.589 --> 01:58:01.599 align:start position:0%
opportunities act so we are
 
01:58:03.830 --> 01:58:03.840 align:start position:0%
we are all of title ii and the services
 
01:58:04.790 --> 01:58:04.800 align:start position:0%
that we provide
 
01:58:08.870 --> 01:58:08.880 align:start position:0%
under under that are designated as
 
01:58:10.790 --> 01:58:10.800 align:start position:0%
basic literacy english as a second
 
01:58:13.030 --> 01:58:13.040 align:start position:0%
language with the goal of transitioning
 
01:58:15.750 --> 01:58:15.760 align:start position:0%
individuals um into post-secondary
 
01:58:17.109 --> 01:58:17.119 align:start position:0%
education training
 
01:58:21.510 --> 01:58:21.520 align:start position:0%
and or employment
 
01:58:24.310 --> 01:58:24.320 align:start position:0%
about 60 percent of the students that we
 
01:58:25.990 --> 01:58:26.000 align:start position:0%
serve in that are english language
 
01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.070 align:start position:0%
serve in that are english language
learners

01:58:28.070 --> 01:58:28.080 align:start position:0%
learners
 
01:58:32.149 --> 01:58:32.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:34.310 --> 01:58:34.320 align:start position:0%
between three and five thousand students
 
01:58:39.350 --> 01:58:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:42.550 --> 01:58:42.560 align:start position:0%
in in the not
 
01:58:45.669 --> 01:58:45.679 align:start position:0%
in total adult ed or just in no
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
that's just in our wioa adult ed program
 
01:58:54.790 --> 01:58:54.800 align:start position:0%
so we also have an adult diploma program
 
01:58:56.870 --> 01:58:56.880 align:start position:0%
and that we have a number of those
 
01:58:58.790 --> 01:58:58.800 align:start position:0%
around the states and in that
 
01:59:02.070 --> 01:59:02.080 align:start position:0%
program students earn credits towards a
 
01:59:03.109 --> 01:59:03.119 align:start position:0%
high school diploma
 
01:59:05.350 --> 01:59:05.360 align:start position:0%
or a high school equivalency work on
 
01:59:06.390 --> 01:59:06.400 align:start position:0%
preparing for the high school
 
01:59:06.400 --> 01:59:07.589 align:start position:0%
preparing for the high school
equivalency

01:59:07.589 --> 01:59:07.599 align:start position:0%
equivalency
 
01:59:10.629 --> 01:59:10.639 align:start position:0%
in that program under
 
01:59:14.390 --> 01:59:14.400 align:start position:0%
state law we are allowed to
 
01:59:17.990 --> 01:59:18.000 align:start position:0%
work with 16 and 17 year olds if they
 
01:59:20.550 --> 01:59:20.560 align:start position:0%
are they remain enrolled in school and
 
01:59:22.870 --> 01:59:22.880 align:start position:0%
they're enrolled in adult education so
 
01:59:24.790 --> 01:59:24.800 align:start position:0%
that may be what you're referring to
 
01:59:26.870 --> 01:59:26.880 align:start position:0%
when you say that the services
 
01:59:29.109 --> 01:59:29.119 align:start position:0%
are working with our high school
 
01:59:29.119 --> 01:59:30.070 align:start position:0%
are working with our high school
students

01:59:30.070 --> 01:59:30.080 align:start position:0%
students
 
01:59:32.070 --> 01:59:32.080 align:start position:0%
um i will tell you that when that
 
01:59:33.910 --> 01:59:33.920 align:start position:0%
program was started back in the
 
01:59:35.589 --> 01:59:35.599 align:start position:0%
i want to say the 80s there were
 
01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:37.280 align:start position:0%
probably 100
 
01:59:38.950 --> 01:59:38.960 align:start position:0%
students that were still enrolled in
 
01:59:41.430 --> 01:59:41.440 align:start position:0%
high school um and in the last couple of
 
01:59:43.990 --> 01:59:44.000 align:start position:0%
years been closer to 1500 to
 
01:59:47.350 --> 01:59:47.360 align:start position:0%
1600 students who are still enrolled in
 
01:59:48.229 --> 01:59:48.239 align:start position:0%
high school who are
 
01:59:50.229 --> 01:59:50.239 align:start position:0%
also earning credits through the adult
 
01:59:54.709 --> 01:59:54.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:56.950 --> 01:59:56.960 align:start position:0%
um and that actually has gone up since
 
01:59:59.910 --> 01:59:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:05.669 --> 02:00:05.679 align:start position:0%
 
02:00:08.470 --> 02:00:08.480 align:start position:0%
um just more of a comment um i just want
 
02:00:10.550 --> 02:00:10.560 align:start position:0%
i'm a big fan of adult education
 
02:00:13.589 --> 02:00:13.599 align:start position:0%
always have been as a former high school
 
02:00:13.599 --> 02:00:14.070 align:start position:0%
always have been as a former high school
teacher

02:00:14.070 --> 02:00:14.080 align:start position:0%
teacher
 
02:00:16.870 --> 02:00:16.880 align:start position:0%
manchester has a robust program as does
 
02:00:16.880 --> 02:00:17.990 align:start position:0%
manchester has a robust program as does
nashua

02:00:17.990 --> 02:00:18.000 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
02:00:20.070 --> 02:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
we've seen hundreds and hundreds of
 
02:00:22.629 --> 02:00:22.639 align:start position:0%
students who become disenfranchised with
 
02:00:23.589 --> 02:00:23.599 align:start position:0%
the traditional
 
02:00:26.870 --> 02:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
public school system or who are
 
02:00:29.589 --> 02:00:29.599 align:start position:0%
fallen into some kind of a hardship
 
02:00:31.589 --> 02:00:31.599 align:start position:0%
where they have to have a full-time job
 
02:00:34.390 --> 02:00:34.400 align:start position:0%
and adult education has become the
 
02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:35.669 align:start position:0%
and adult education has become the
vehicle

02:00:35.669 --> 02:00:35.679 align:start position:0%
vehicle
 
02:00:38.470 --> 02:00:38.480 align:start position:0%
by which they can get a diploma or an
 
02:00:38.480 --> 02:00:39.830 align:start position:0%
by which they can get a diploma or an
equivalency

02:00:39.830 --> 02:00:39.840 align:start position:0%
equivalency
 
02:00:43.510 --> 02:00:43.520 align:start position:0%
we've also seen a lot of students who
 
02:00:45.830 --> 02:00:45.840 align:start position:0%
need a kind of a refresher course in
 
02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:46.709 align:start position:0%
need a kind of a refresher course in
mathematics

02:00:46.709 --> 02:00:46.719 align:start position:0%
mathematics
 
02:00:51.030 --> 02:00:51.040 align:start position:0%
will often take an adult ed class
 
02:00:53.589 --> 02:00:53.599 align:start position:0%
in math in order to get into the
 
02:00:53.599 --> 02:00:54.149 align:start position:0%
in math in order to get into the
community

02:00:54.149 --> 02:00:54.159 align:start position:0%
community
 
02:00:56.470 --> 02:00:56.480 align:start position:0%
college or a four-year college because
 
02:00:58.070 --> 02:00:58.080 align:start position:0%
their math skills just aren't
 
02:01:02.470 --> 02:01:02.480 align:start position:0%
up to par so adult education is a
 
02:01:05.510 --> 02:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
i mean through my lens and the data i
 
02:01:05.520 --> 02:01:05.910 align:start position:0%
i mean through my lens and the data i
think

02:01:05.910 --> 02:01:05.920 align:start position:0%
think
 
02:01:09.589 --> 02:01:09.599 align:start position:0%
supports it has been very productive
 
02:01:11.990 --> 02:01:12.000 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and a big
 
02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:12.709 align:start position:0%
in the state of new hampshire and a big
help

02:01:12.709 --> 02:01:12.719 align:start position:0%
help
 
02:01:16.229 --> 02:01:16.239 align:start position:0%
since we changed the graduation
 
02:01:19.910 --> 02:01:19.920 align:start position:0%
age to 18 we've seen a lot of students
 
02:01:22.709 --> 02:01:22.719 align:start position:0%
matriculate through adult education very
 
02:01:22.719 --> 02:01:24.950 align:start position:0%
matriculate through adult education very
successfully

02:01:24.950 --> 02:01:24.960 align:start position:0%
successfully
 
02:01:28.870 --> 02:01:28.880 align:start position:0%
thank you i i like i said i wasn't
 
02:01:32.310 --> 02:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
uh i'm not opposed to the adult ed
 
02:01:36.149 --> 02:01:36.159 align:start position:0%
program i'm just wasn't sure um
 
02:01:39.910 --> 02:01:39.920 align:start position:0%
what what we were including in there and
 
02:01:41.990 --> 02:01:42.000 align:start position:0%
i think that sarah probably helped me a
 
02:01:43.589 --> 02:01:43.599 align:start position:0%
little bit uh
 
02:01:46.870 --> 02:01:46.880 align:start position:0%
including the geds
 
02:01:49.990 --> 02:01:50.000 align:start position:0%
and the those kinds of things which
 
02:01:53.189 --> 02:01:53.199 align:start position:0%
are which are extremely important
 
02:01:55.350 --> 02:01:55.360 align:start position:0%
so thank you very much i appreciate it
 
02:01:58.709 --> 02:01:58.719 align:start position:0%
sarah by the way i like your background
 
02:02:02.870 --> 02:02:02.880 align:start position:0%
thank you it's new hampshire
 
02:02:07.510 --> 02:02:07.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:11.669 --> 02:02:11.679 align:start position:0%
are there any other questions
 
02:02:17.189 --> 02:02:17.199 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:34.229 --> 02:02:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:02:38.229 --> 02:02:38.239 align:start position:0%
doesn't look like it so
 
02:02:41.430 --> 02:02:41.440 align:start position:0%
i want to thank everybody that came this
 
02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.950 align:start position:0%
i want to thank everybody that came this
morning

02:02:42.950 --> 02:02:42.960 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:02:45.990 --> 02:02:46.000 align:start position:0%
and you did a good job explaining things
 
02:02:50.790 --> 02:02:50.800 align:start position:0%
i think helping us all um
 
02:02:53.350 --> 02:02:53.360 align:start position:0%
we have no idea where we're going with
 
02:02:53.990 --> 02:02:54.000 align:start position:0%
the budget
 
02:02:59.189 --> 02:02:59.199 align:start position:0%
at this time we've gathered a lot of
 
02:03:02.390 --> 02:03:02.400 align:start position:0%
information and um
 
02:03:07.270 --> 02:03:07.280 align:start position:0%
we've got uh we got a lot of work to do
 
02:03:11.669 --> 02:03:11.679 align:start position:0%
and i guess uh
 
02:03:15.589 --> 02:03:15.599 align:start position:0%
mickey is there anything in hb2
 
02:03:20.470 --> 02:03:20.480 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:22.229 --> 02:03:22.239 align:start position:0%
i mean we've got the change relative to
 
02:03:24.149 --> 02:03:24.159 align:start position:0%
the free reduced lunch adm
 
02:03:25.510 --> 02:03:25.520 align:start position:0%
which will come up when you talk about
 
02:03:29.510 --> 02:03:29.520 align:start position:0%
school funding we'll deal with that then
 
02:03:31.030 --> 02:03:31.040 align:start position:0%
there was the new hampshire scholars
 
02:03:32.550 --> 02:03:32.560 align:start position:0%
program the extension of the
 
02:03:34.310 --> 02:03:34.320 align:start position:0%
authority to accept the grants gifts
 
02:03:37.669 --> 02:03:37.679 align:start position:0%
donations for that accounting unit
 
02:03:39.589 --> 02:03:39.599 align:start position:0%
you do have a couple retain bills
 
02:03:40.950 --> 02:03:40.960 align:start position:0%
relative to education
 
02:03:42.149 --> 02:03:42.159 align:start position:0%
that you know the committee will
 
02:03:44.229 --> 02:03:44.239 align:start position:0%
probably want to consider uh
 
02:03:45.990 --> 02:03:46.000 align:start position:0%
those in relation to house bill 2
 
02:03:47.030 --> 02:03:47.040 align:start position:0%
whether or not you're going to want to
 
02:03:48.709 --> 02:03:48.719 align:start position:0%
add anything from those bills to house
 
02:03:50.229 --> 02:03:50.239 align:start position:0%
bill 2.
 
02:03:51.510 --> 02:03:51.520 align:start position:0%
but nothing i don't think we haven't
 
02:03:55.109 --> 02:03:55.119 align:start position:0%
 
02:03:58.470 --> 02:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
okay and uh yeah and we do have a couple
 
02:04:00.229 --> 02:04:00.239 align:start position:0%
of bills
 
02:04:03.270 --> 02:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
that are still need to uh
 
02:04:06.069 --> 02:04:06.079 align:start position:0%
to come to us yeah i think we were
 
02:04:07.109 --> 02:04:07.119 align:start position:0%
referred a couple
 
02:04:09.270 --> 02:04:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh second committee bills one relative
 
02:04:11.030 --> 02:04:11.040 align:start position:0%
to school building aid and one relative
 
02:04:11.040 --> 02:04:11.350 align:start position:0%
to school building aid and one relative
to

02:04:11.350 --> 02:04:11.360 align:start position:0%
to
 
02:04:14.310 --> 02:04:14.320 align:start position:0%
special education aid and the new uh
 
02:04:14.320 --> 02:04:14.709 align:start position:0%
special education aid and the new uh
risk

02:04:14.709 --> 02:04:14.719 align:start position:0%
risk
 
02:04:18.069 --> 02:04:18.079 align:start position:0%
shared risk pool uh proposal um
 
02:04:19.430 --> 02:04:19.440 align:start position:0%
neither of those we have we've had a
 
02:04:21.189 --> 02:04:21.199 align:start position:0%
work session on yet so
 
02:04:25.589 --> 02:04:25.599 align:start position:0%
yeah we'll figure that out for soon
 
02:04:29.189 --> 02:04:29.199 align:start position:0%
yes representative heath if the folks
 
02:04:30.709 --> 02:04:30.719 align:start position:0%
from doe want to go
 
02:04:34.310 --> 02:04:34.320 align:start position:0%
you may just ask them a quick question
 
02:04:36.069 --> 02:04:36.079 align:start position:0%
is there anything else that they'd like
 
02:04:37.589 --> 02:04:37.599 align:start position:0%
to tell us that
 
02:04:39.750 --> 02:04:39.760 align:start position:0%
we didn't ask them that they'd like to
 
02:04:43.109 --> 02:04:43.119 align:start position:0%
share with us in terms of their budget
 
02:04:46.149 --> 02:04:46.159 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:50.790 --> 02:04:50.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:52.950 --> 02:04:52.960 align:start position:0%
okay you can stay or you can leave
 
02:04:53.990 --> 02:04:54.000 align:start position:0%
that's okay
 
02:04:57.430 --> 02:04:57.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:04:59.589 --> 02:04:59.599 align:start position:0%
mickey we'll have to uh we'll have to
 
02:05:01.430 --> 02:05:01.440 align:start position:0%
schedule those things shortly
 
02:05:05.350 --> 02:05:05.360 align:start position:0%
i think everybody saw that um
 
02:05:10.149 --> 02:05:10.159 align:start position:0%
the the drop dead dates in the calendar
 
02:05:11.830 --> 02:05:11.840 align:start position:0%
has changed
 
02:05:15.189 --> 02:05:15.199 align:start position:0%
and um that's going to
 
02:05:18.709 --> 02:05:18.719 align:start position:0%
um make it particularly difficult i
 
02:05:19.990 --> 02:05:20.000 align:start position:0%
think is the right term
 
02:05:25.030 --> 02:05:25.040 align:start position:0%
for us because um
 
02:05:28.550 --> 02:05:28.560 align:start position:0%
we may or may not have uh
 
02:05:31.430 --> 02:05:31.440 align:start position:0%
positions you know house positions on
 
02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:32.629 align:start position:0%
positions you know house positions on
things

02:05:32.629 --> 02:05:32.639 align:start position:0%
things
 
02:05:36.149 --> 02:05:36.159 align:start position:0%
that um maybe should
 
02:05:39.589 --> 02:05:39.599 align:start position:0%
go into uh hb2
 
02:05:42.709 --> 02:05:42.719 align:start position:0%
so it's um
 
02:05:45.510 --> 02:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
i don't know well we'll we'll stumble
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
along and do the best we can
 
02:05:47.280 --> 02:05:50.950 align:start position:0%
along and do the best we can
but

02:05:50.950 --> 02:05:50.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:05:54.229 --> 02:05:54.239 align:start position:0%
we'll we'll manage somehow but
 
02:05:58.229 --> 02:05:58.239 align:start position:0%
uh so no meeting tomorrow
 
02:06:01.669 --> 02:06:01.679 align:start position:0%
wednesday thursday and friday
 
02:06:06.310 --> 02:06:06.320 align:start position:0%
and friday is going to be the um
 
02:06:10.550 --> 02:06:10.560 align:start position:0%
university system and we're going to
 
02:06:15.270 --> 02:06:15.280 align:start position:0%
talk about that in the uh in the morning
 
02:06:18.550 --> 02:06:18.560 align:start position:0%
their cost saving measures
 
02:06:22.550 --> 02:06:22.560 align:start position:0%
and then we'll press on to
 
02:06:26.950 --> 02:06:26.960 align:start position:0%
the combination of
 
02:06:30.470 --> 02:06:30.480 align:start position:0%
the two systems uh represent murray you
 
02:06:31.510 --> 02:06:31.520 align:start position:0%
have a question
 
02:06:33.990 --> 02:06:34.000 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you is uh margie smith going
 
02:06:35.589 --> 02:06:35.599 align:start position:0%
to be joining us for that i thought that
 
02:06:37.109 --> 02:06:37.119 align:start position:0%
there was some
 
02:06:40.629 --> 02:06:40.639 align:start position:0%
possibility that she may be sitting in
 
02:06:43.270 --> 02:06:43.280 align:start position:0%
i don't know i have i need to call her
 
02:06:43.990 --> 02:06:44.000 align:start position:0%
and i'll probably
 
02:06:47.350 --> 02:06:47.360 align:start position:0%
do that tomorrow can i have one other
 
02:06:48.950 --> 02:06:48.960 align:start position:0%
thing related unrelated to this
 
02:06:51.669 --> 02:06:51.679 align:start position:0%
andrea asked about covid there's someone
 
02:06:53.430 --> 02:06:53.440 align:start position:0%
in our neighborhood who received moderna
 
02:06:55.430 --> 02:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
for their first vaccine and pfizer for
 
02:06:56.550 --> 02:06:56.560 align:start position:0%
the second
 
02:06:58.470 --> 02:06:58.480 align:start position:0%
cdc doesn't even know what to do about
 
02:07:00.149 --> 02:07:00.159 align:start position:0%
that so when you go
 
02:07:01.910 --> 02:07:01.920 align:start position:0%
and they checked at every they checked
 
02:07:03.589 --> 02:07:03.599 align:start position:0%
they checked they checked at the very
 
02:07:05.189 --> 02:07:05.199 align:start position:0%
end when the nurse came out this was the
 
02:07:07.430 --> 02:07:07.440 align:start position:0%
tuesday when it was so windy and cold
 
02:07:09.030 --> 02:07:09.040 align:start position:0%
and everyone was miserable
 
02:07:10.830 --> 02:07:10.840 align:start position:0%
uh they were injected with the wrong
 
02:07:12.870 --> 02:07:12.880 align:start position:0%
vaccine and they've been in touch with
 
02:07:14.310 --> 02:07:14.320 align:start position:0%
cdc and it's like
 
02:07:16.069 --> 02:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
they don't really know what this means
 
02:07:17.669 --> 02:07:17.679 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure it's not the only time it's
 
02:07:17.679 --> 02:07:18.310 align:start position:0%
but i'm sure it's not the only time it's
happened

02:07:18.310 --> 02:07:18.320 align:start position:0%
happened
 
02:07:20.149 --> 02:07:20.159 align:start position:0%
but for all of us going in when you go
 
02:07:21.830 --> 02:07:21.840 align:start position:0%
for your second time double double
 
02:07:23.430 --> 02:07:23.440 align:start position:0%
double triple check that when they put
 
02:07:25.189 --> 02:07:25.199 align:start position:0%
it in your arm it's the right one
 
02:07:27.990 --> 02:07:28.000 align:start position:0%
thank you public service announcement so
 
02:07:30.069 --> 02:07:30.079 align:start position:0%
that was a that's a great public service
 
02:07:30.079 --> 02:07:32.240 align:start position:0%
that was a that's a great public service
announcement

02:07:32.240 --> 02:07:32.250 align:start position:0%
announcement
 
02:07:32.250 --> 02:07:34.870 align:start position:0%
announcement
[Music]

02:07:34.870 --> 02:07:34.880 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
02:07:38.830 --> 02:07:38.840 align:start position:0%
yeah so i don't know
 
02:07:41.830 --> 02:07:41.840 align:start position:0%
um i representative he
 
02:07:45.189 --> 02:07:45.199 align:start position:0%
said that she has a doctor's appointment
 
02:07:46.790 --> 02:07:46.800 align:start position:0%
on the 22nd
 
02:07:48.950 --> 02:07:48.960 align:start position:0%
and so on that date we won't do any
 
02:07:48.960 --> 02:07:51.510 align:start position:0%
and so on that date we won't do any
voting

02:07:51.510 --> 02:07:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
02:07:54.870 --> 02:07:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh because she won't be available and i
 
02:07:57.990 --> 02:07:58.000 align:start position:0%
think it's only appropriate that we
 
02:08:00.310 --> 02:08:00.320 align:start position:0%
when we are doing any voting that
 
02:08:01.669 --> 02:08:01.679 align:start position:0%
everybody that can
 
02:08:04.390 --> 02:08:04.400 align:start position:0%
uh everybody that's here needs to be
 
02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:05.589 align:start position:0%
uh everybody that's here needs to be
here

02:08:05.589 --> 02:08:05.599 align:start position:0%
here
 
02:08:08.870 --> 02:08:08.880 align:start position:0%
and so because we've all heard
 
02:08:12.790 --> 02:08:12.800 align:start position:0%
we've all heard the testimony um
 
02:08:15.270 --> 02:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
they're still trying to come to grips
 
02:08:15.280 --> 02:08:16.229 align:start position:0%
they're still trying to come to grips
with

02:08:16.229 --> 02:08:16.239 align:start position:0%
with
 
02:08:17.830 --> 02:08:17.840 align:start position:0%
when we're going to have the public
 
02:08:17.840 --> 02:08:20.830 align:start position:0%
when we're going to have the public
hearing

02:08:20.830 --> 02:08:20.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:23.990 --> 02:08:24.000 align:start position:0%
um for there's a
 
02:08:27.510 --> 02:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
proposal for one at four o'clock in the
 
02:08:27.520 --> 02:08:28.870 align:start position:0%
proposal for one at four o'clock in the
afternoon

02:08:28.870 --> 02:08:28.880 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
02:08:30.950 --> 02:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
and then one at nine o'clock in the
 
02:08:30.960 --> 02:08:32.149 align:start position:0%
and then one at nine o'clock in the
morning

02:08:32.149 --> 02:08:32.159 align:start position:0%
morning
 
02:08:35.510 --> 02:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
and so we'll have to uh sort
 
02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:39.360 align:start position:0%
ourselves through that um
 
02:08:42.390 --> 02:08:42.400 align:start position:0%
and uh try to
 
02:08:45.270 --> 02:08:45.280 align:start position:0%
try to get ourselves together on that
 
02:08:48.629 --> 02:08:48.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:52.229 --> 02:08:52.239 align:start position:0%
we have to be finished is it the 29th
 
02:08:52.239 --> 02:08:56.629 align:start position:0%
we have to be finished is it the 29th
mickey

02:08:56.629 --> 02:08:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:59.990 --> 02:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
so i think the 26th is a friday
 
02:09:02.149 --> 02:09:02.159 align:start position:0%
and that was the original drop dead date
 
02:09:03.589 --> 02:09:03.599 align:start position:0%
that i had for all of the division
 
02:09:05.910 --> 02:09:05.920 align:start position:0%
decisions to be made by
 
02:09:07.750 --> 02:09:07.760 align:start position:0%
that was assuming we would have a house
 
02:09:09.430 --> 02:09:09.440 align:start position:0%
a full committee exec session that
 
02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:10.229 align:start position:0%
a full committee exec session that
following

02:09:10.229 --> 02:09:10.239 align:start position:0%
following
 
02:09:11.990 --> 02:09:12.000 align:start position:0%
monday tuesday wednesday somewhere and
 
02:09:13.910 --> 02:09:13.920 align:start position:0%
there so that would give us time to put
 
02:09:15.430 --> 02:09:15.440 align:start position:0%
it all together before we have a full
 
02:09:17.990 --> 02:09:18.000 align:start position:0%
finance exec um
 
02:09:19.910 --> 02:09:19.920 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anything's changing with
 
02:09:19.920 --> 02:09:21.430 align:start position:0%
i don't know if anything's changing with
um

02:09:21.430 --> 02:09:21.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
02:09:22.790 --> 02:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
you know like if there's house session
 
02:09:24.629 --> 02:09:24.639 align:start position:0%
days that fall anywhere and it screws up
 
02:09:24.639 --> 02:09:25.189 align:start position:0%
days that fall anywhere and it screws up
the

02:09:25.189 --> 02:09:25.199 align:start position:0%
the
 
02:09:28.310 --> 02:09:28.320 align:start position:0%
the exact days for the finance committee
 
02:09:29.830 --> 02:09:29.840 align:start position:0%
i will cross that bridge when we come to
 
02:09:31.350 --> 02:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
it but i think right now we're we're
 
02:09:32.790 --> 02:09:32.800 align:start position:0%
still shooting for the division
 
02:09:34.790 --> 02:09:34.800 align:start position:0%
recommendations to be complete by
 
02:09:38.550 --> 02:09:38.560 align:start position:0%
friday the 26th okay
 
02:09:42.709 --> 02:09:42.719 align:start position:0%
that that sounds good so um
 
02:09:45.830 --> 02:09:45.840 align:start position:0%
have a great afternoon
 
02:09:48.790 --> 02:09:48.800 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that we we look
 
02:09:48.800 --> 02:09:49.350 align:start position:0%
we need to make sure that we we look
through

02:09:49.350 --> 02:09:49.360 align:start position:0%
through
 
02:09:52.629 --> 02:09:52.639 align:start position:0%
uh safety and transportation
 
02:09:56.870 --> 02:09:56.880 align:start position:0%
to see what's going on there because
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
we've got a we've got a six million
 
02:10:01.109 --> 02:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
dollar problem
 
02:10:04.229 --> 02:10:04.239 align:start position:0%
at least so um
 
02:10:08.629 --> 02:10:08.639 align:start position:0%
that's uh that's our next uh
 
02:10:12.550 --> 02:10:12.560 align:start position:0%
our next thing as far as um
 
02:10:15.510 --> 02:10:15.520 align:start position:0%
what's going on with the education fund
 
02:10:16.629 --> 02:10:16.639 align:start position:0%
we've got
 
02:10:19.830 --> 02:10:19.840 align:start position:0%
a significant
 
02:10:23.189 --> 02:10:23.199 align:start position:0%
problem there as well so
 
02:10:26.629 --> 02:10:26.639 align:start position:0%
um i know it says uh
 
02:10:28.069 --> 02:10:28.079 align:start position:0%
you know if you don't have money in the
 
02:10:29.669 --> 02:10:29.679 align:start position:0%
education fund you can take it from the
 
02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:31.360 align:start position:0%
general fund but oh by the way
 
02:10:33.669 --> 02:10:33.679 align:start position:0%
the general fund doesn't have the money
 
02:10:34.470 --> 02:10:34.480 align:start position:0%
and so
 
02:10:38.470 --> 02:10:38.480 align:start position:0%
we have to uh figure out how
 
02:10:41.510 --> 02:10:41.520 align:start position:0%
within the education trust fund we can
 
02:10:42.629 --> 02:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
at least
 
02:10:45.669 --> 02:10:45.679 align:start position:0%
semi get to zero because that
 
02:10:49.750 --> 02:10:49.760 align:start position:0%
is a uh that is it's an issue
 
02:10:53.109 --> 02:10:53.119 align:start position:0%
and um i think we've all you know we all
 
02:10:53.119 --> 02:10:53.510 align:start position:0%
and um i think we've all you know we all
know

02:10:53.510 --> 02:10:53.520 align:start position:0%
know
 
02:10:56.790 --> 02:10:56.800 align:start position:0%
that ways and means and my humble
 
02:10:56.800 --> 02:10:57.430 align:start position:0%
that ways and means and my humble
opinion

02:10:57.430 --> 02:10:57.440 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
02:11:01.350 --> 02:11:01.360 align:start position:0%
cheated us but that's my opinion i can't
 
02:11:04.550 --> 02:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
uh i wasn't there but
 
02:11:09.270 --> 02:11:09.280 align:start position:0%
um we need to uh we need to try to
 
02:11:12.550 --> 02:11:12.560 align:start position:0%
think about that and
 
02:11:15.750 --> 02:11:15.760 align:start position:0%
what's available and i agree
 
02:11:19.030 --> 02:11:19.040 align:start position:0%
with many of representative he's
 
02:11:19.040 --> 02:11:19.750 align:start position:0%
with many of representative he's
comments

02:11:19.750 --> 02:11:19.760 align:start position:0%
comments
 
02:11:21.830 --> 02:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
that you know we really need this
 
02:11:23.270 --> 02:11:23.280 align:start position:0%
program back
 
02:11:26.790 --> 02:11:26.800 align:start position:0%
and i don't disagree but what program
 
02:11:28.390 --> 02:11:28.400 align:start position:0%
are we going to eliminate
 
02:11:31.109 --> 02:11:31.119 align:start position:0%
to get that program back and that's
 
02:11:33.109 --> 02:11:33.119 align:start position:0%
that's the um
 
02:11:34.870 --> 02:11:34.880 align:start position:0%
those are the decisions that we'll be
 
02:11:34.880 --> 02:11:36.229 align:start position:0%
those are the decisions that we'll be
making

02:11:36.229 --> 02:11:36.239 align:start position:0%
making
 
02:11:39.189 --> 02:11:39.199 align:start position:0%
in a couple weeks so think about them
 
02:11:39.199 --> 02:11:39.669 align:start position:0%
in a couple weeks so think about them
and

02:11:39.669 --> 02:11:39.679 align:start position:0%
and
 
02:11:43.510 --> 02:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
