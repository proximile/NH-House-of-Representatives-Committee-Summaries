00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:19.140 align:start position:0%
those incorporate other Auditors the
 
00:09:21.710 --> 00:09:21.720 align:start position:0%
largest being the which we refer to was
 
00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:23.880 align:start position:0%
the pension trust funds
 
00:09:25.910 --> 00:09:25.920 align:start position:0%
we also issued our required
 
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:28.500 align:start position:0%
supplementary our opinion in relation to
 
00:09:30.590 --> 00:09:30.600 align:start position:0%
for the supplementary schedules that's
 
00:09:33.410 --> 00:09:33.420 align:start position:0%
over the mdna and the required on
 
00:09:36.009 --> 00:09:36.019 align:start position:0%
schedules of your opeb and pension plans
 
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:39.240 align:start position:0%
that was also a clean opinion as it
 
00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:41.279 align:start position:0%
related to the financial statements of
 
00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:43.320 align:start position:0%
the basic the basic financial statements
 
00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
we concluded they were fairly presented
 
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:48.480 align:start position:0%
our other required communication that
 
00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:50.399 align:start position:0%
you can see in our packet was over
 
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:53.160 align:start position:0%
internal controls on financial reporting
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
we identified two uncorrected audit
 
00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:58.080 align:start position:0%
misstatement and two corrected
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
misstatements we received and confirmed
 
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:02.820 align:start position:0%
with management that the effects of the
 
00:10:04.509 --> 00:10:04.519 align:start position:0%
uncorrected financial
 
00:10:07.250 --> 00:10:07.260 align:start position:0%
uncorrected misstatements did not have a
 
00:10:09.829 --> 00:10:09.839 align:start position:0%
material account or impact on the
 
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:11.760 align:start position:0%
financial statements individually and in
 
00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:13.260 align:start position:0%
the aggregate
 
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
the one corrected misstatement did
 
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:16.740 align:start position:0%
result in a material weakness which
 
00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:18.360 align:start position:0%
you'll see in your packet on slide four
 
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:20.700 align:start position:0%
as it related to unemployment Securities
 
00:10:23.150 --> 00:10:23.160 align:start position:0%
it was a partially due to the advances
 
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:24.600 align:start position:0%
of the federal funds that occurred
 
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.060 align:start position:0%
during the pandemic
 
00:10:30.410 --> 00:10:30.420 align:start position:0%
we did Issue a yellow book report which
 
00:10:32.329 --> 00:10:32.339 align:start position:0%
is a report on internal controls over
 
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:34.860 align:start position:0%
financial reporting and compliance in
 
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
other matters of the audit which will be
 
00:10:38.690 --> 00:10:38.700 align:start position:0%
filed with the federal government with
 
00:10:41.389 --> 00:10:41.399 align:start position:0%
your single audit later in the year that
 
00:10:44.030 --> 00:10:44.040 align:start position:0%
report did also note no significant
 
00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and the one material
 
00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:47.269 align:start position:0%
deficiencies and the one material
weakness

00:10:47.269 --> 00:10:47.279 align:start position:0%
weakness
 
00:10:48.949 --> 00:10:48.959 align:start position:0%
we had no disagreements with management
 
00:10:50.990 --> 00:10:51.000 align:start position:0%
throughout the audit and no significant
 
00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:54.000 align:start position:0%
difficulties during the audit which is
 
00:10:55.730 --> 00:10:55.740 align:start position:0%
again is a testament to your financial
 
00:10:58.730 --> 00:10:58.740 align:start position:0%
reporting process and internal controls
 
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
I like to open it up to see if anyone
 
00:11:02.990 --> 00:11:03.000 align:start position:0%
has any questions today for me
 
00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:06.240 align:start position:0%
any questions for the auditor from from
 
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:11.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:13.560 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
 
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:15.949 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much thank
you

00:11:15.949 --> 00:11:15.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:18.710 --> 00:11:18.720 align:start position:0%
Mr Smith any comments
 
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:20.160 align:start position:0%
no I think at the at the end of the
 
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:22.320 align:start position:0%
meeting I believe if Department
 
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:23.640 align:start position:0%
administrative Services either
 
00:11:26.329 --> 00:11:26.339 align:start position:0%
comptroller or the commissioner will
 
00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:28.980 align:start position:0%
maybe have them then unless
 
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:31.560 align:start position:0%
that'll work okay and just to remind the
 
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:33.720 align:start position:0%
committee that all the audits today the
 
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:36.000 align:start position:0%
reports were accepted and approved for
 
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:37.980 align:start position:0%
release when available back in at the
 
00:11:39.829 --> 00:11:39.839 align:start position:0%
November meeting so that's a task you
 
00:11:41.690 --> 00:11:41.700 align:start position:0%
don't have to do today so the rest of
 
00:11:43.009 --> 00:11:43.019 align:start position:0%
the audits will be presented at the end
 
00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:46.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:54.290 --> 00:11:54.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:59.150 --> 00:11:59.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:01.620 align:start position:0%
we don't need it it's been done all
 
00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:04.160 align:start position:0%
right and congratulations
 
00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner arlinghaus to your
 
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:09.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:10.680 align:start position:0%
anyone you wish to recognize
 
00:12:24.710 --> 00:12:24.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:30.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:33.290 --> 00:12:33.300 align:start position:0%
all right moving on to our agenda we'll
 
00:12:39.829 --> 00:12:39.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
recommendation by the Legislative
 
00:12:44.329 --> 00:12:44.339 align:start position:0%
performance audit oversight committee
 
00:12:48.530 --> 00:12:48.540 align:start position:0%
that a performance audit be done
 
00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:57.420 align:start position:0%
a motion to approve so moved
 
00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
motion second to approve the performance
 
00:13:04.190 --> 00:13:04.200 align:start position:0%
audit oversight recommendation
 
00:13:06.889 --> 00:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
further discussion seeing none
 
00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:18.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:21.949 --> 00:13:21.959 align:start position:0%
did and I know I'm not sure whether
 
00:13:24.050 --> 00:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
every Department because I'm new to this
 
00:13:26.090 --> 00:13:26.100 align:start position:0%
committee I'm not sure whether every
 
00:13:27.910 --> 00:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
department is required to get a
 
00:13:31.069 --> 00:13:31.079 align:start position:0%
performance audit but in speaking with
 
00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:33.480 align:start position:0%
her they have made some significant
 
00:13:36.889 --> 00:13:36.899 align:start position:0%
changes in their processes and I I just
 
00:13:38.930 --> 00:13:38.940 align:start position:0%
don't understand the need for for an
 
00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:41.160 align:start position:0%
audit so I will be voting against it
 
00:13:44.030 --> 00:13:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:46.260 align:start position:0%
the performance on an oversight
 
00:13:49.129 --> 00:13:49.139 align:start position:0%
committee meets this looks at various
 
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:51.300 align:start position:0%
things that they bring from their
 
00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:54.300 align:start position:0%
experience they recommend it and give a
 
00:13:56.329 --> 00:13:56.339 align:start position:0%
little Spiel on why they recommend it
 
00:13:58.310 --> 00:13:58.320 align:start position:0%
and if they're supported by the rest of
 
00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:00.440 align:start position:0%
the committee then it comes to us so
 
00:14:03.290 --> 00:14:03.300 align:start position:0%
performance audits aren't done on every
 
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:05.940 align:start position:0%
agency but they're done on a regular
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
basis and you know we look for where
 
00:14:11.329 --> 00:14:11.339 align:start position:0%
people think they have a problem and
 
00:14:12.829 --> 00:14:12.839 align:start position:0%
they bring it forward and try to
 
00:14:14.329 --> 00:14:14.339 align:start position:0%
convince the rest of the committee and
 
00:14:16.009 --> 00:14:16.019 align:start position:0%
if that's so then it comes to us for
 
00:14:16.019 --> 00:14:17.449 align:start position:0%
if that's so then it comes to us for
approval

00:14:17.449 --> 00:14:17.459 align:start position:0%
approval
 
00:14:20.329 --> 00:14:20.339 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:22.980 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards uh thank you Mr
 
00:14:26.750 --> 00:14:26.760 align:start position:0%
chair I I think it may also uh help
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
Senator Birdsall if I've if I've heard
 
00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:31.800 align:start position:0%
this right at this point in the process
 
00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:34.380 align:start position:0%
it would take a unanimous vote of the
 
00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:37.380 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee to not do this audit
 
00:14:40.129 --> 00:14:40.139 align:start position:0%
that the the audit at this point is
 
00:14:43.189 --> 00:14:43.199 align:start position:0%
pretty much guaranteed unless all of us
 
00:14:45.889 --> 00:14:45.899 align:start position:0%
said no is that the case sir
 
00:14:48.170 --> 00:14:48.180 align:start position:0%
yes thank you

the
 
00:14:59.389 --> 00:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
the movement of the of the art I think
 
00:15:02.569 --> 00:15:02.579 align:start position:0%
there was ample evidence given that this
 
00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:04.260 align:start position:0%
audit was required
 
00:15:06.889 --> 00:15:06.899 align:start position:0%
one hadn't been done in a long time and
 
00:15:08.689 --> 00:15:08.699 align:start position:0%
that uh
 
00:15:10.970 --> 00:15:10.980 align:start position:0%
because of the circumstances this this
 
00:15:13.370 --> 00:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
was essential
 
00:15:15.769 --> 00:15:15.779 align:start position:0%
thank you all right since there is some
 
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:23.220 align:start position:0%

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:30.660 align:start position:0%

chair if they want to move the whole
 
00:17:05.689 --> 00:17:05.699 align:start position:0%

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:12.660 align:start position:0%
that to uh chairman Weiler
 
00:17:14.569 --> 00:17:14.579 align:start position:0%
so I thought it just applied to the one
 
00:17:16.669 --> 00:17:16.679 align:start position:0%
on Tab five it applies to all the ones
 
00:17:19.370 --> 00:17:19.380 align:start position:0%
from the airline down it uh so if tabs
 
00:17:23.329 --> 00:17:23.339 align:start position:0%
five through I believe it's 10 are all
 
00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:25.980 align:start position:0%
on the consent calendar the previous
 
00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:28.140 align:start position:0%
committee uh I think it's probably the
 
00:17:29.390 --> 00:17:29.400 align:start position:0%
first time it had the previous committee
 
00:17:30.770 --> 00:17:30.780 align:start position:0%
what they would do is then move the
 
00:17:33.409 --> 00:17:33.419 align:start position:0%
entire consent calendar minus the items
 
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:35.340 align:start position:0%
that any member wants to pull off so the
 
00:17:36.830 --> 00:17:36.840 align:start position:0%
first thing would be if there's any
 
00:17:39.049 --> 00:17:39.059 align:start position:0%
items on the consent that members would
 
00:17:40.850 --> 00:17:40.860 align:start position:0%
like to pull off so they can ask the
 
00:17:44.690 --> 00:17:44.700 align:start position:0%
agencies questions to Just note those
 
00:17:47.029 --> 00:17:47.039 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
00:17:49.250 --> 00:17:49.260 align:start position:0%
what I've been told of members take a
 
00:17:53.450 --> 00:17:53.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:59.409 --> 00:17:59.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:05.750 --> 00:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:09.049 --> 00:18:09.059 align:start position:0%
that's been withdrawn
 
00:18:11.510 --> 00:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
to have six
 
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:13.500 align:start position:0%
oh that no that item was withdrawal that
 
00:18:15.110 --> 00:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
was withdrawn so there isn't there is no
 
00:18:16.970 --> 00:18:16.980 align:start position:0%
item that's correct
 
00:18:21.830 --> 00:18:21.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.810 --> 00:18:26.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:29.029 --> 00:18:29.039 align:start position:0%

okay
 
00:20:15.830 --> 00:20:15.840 align:start position:0%

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:18.240 align:start position:0%
the 10 10.
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
well that that's under the uh oh that's
 
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:22.740 align:start position:0%
already off
 
00:20:24.710 --> 00:20:24.720 align:start position:0%
I need to check that out no I haven't
 
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:27.240 align:start position:0%
come to Tab 10 yet that's I said I'm
 
00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:28.980 align:start position:0%
just going ahead with the consent
 
00:20:31.370 --> 00:20:31.380 align:start position:0%
calendar until we get to American Rescue
 
00:20:33.169 --> 00:20:33.179 align:start position:0%
plan then I'll take up a separate
 
00:20:35.210 --> 00:20:35.220 align:start position:0%
consent calendar all right
 
00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.250 align:start position:0%
consent calendar all right
so

00:20:40.250 --> 00:20:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:42.590 --> 00:20:42.600 align:start position:0%
move to acceptance
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
well is there a motion to accept the
 
00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:46.760 align:start position:0%
rest of the consent calendar
 
00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:50.460 align:start position:0%
three moves so to clarify Mr chair yes
 
00:20:52.970 --> 00:20:52.980 align:start position:0%
when you say the rest you are excluding
 
00:20:55.130 --> 00:20:55.140 align:start position:0%
Tab 10 at this point are you not I'm
 
00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:57.600 align:start position:0%
excluding tab 10. all right come to that
 
00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
later so so the the prior tabs minus the
 
00:21:04.130 --> 00:21:04.140 align:start position:0%
line items that you've read off that's
 
00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:06.120 align:start position:0%
what's that's that's what the vote is
 
00:21:07.789 --> 00:21:07.799 align:start position:0%
thank you sir okay
 
00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:10.860 align:start position:0%
all in favor of the approving the rest
 
00:21:13.970 --> 00:21:13.980 align:start position:0%
of the consent calendars say aye opposed
 
00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:14.690 align:start position:0%
of the consent calendars say aye opposed
no

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:14.700 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:21:18.409 --> 00:21:18.419 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:19.789 --> 00:21:19.799 align:start position:0%
Senator Gray
 
00:21:22.370 --> 00:21:22.380 align:start position:0%
seconded by I think Senator Rose Senator
 
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:31.740 align:start position:0%
field all right
 
00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:33.289 align:start position:0%
field all right
so

00:21:33.289 --> 00:21:33.299 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:21:37.970 --> 00:21:37.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:41.640 align:start position:0%
FIS 23020 Department of military Affairs
 
00:21:46.850 --> 00:21:46.860 align:start position:0%

has been approved o22 has been withdrawn
 
00:21:53.890 --> 00:21:53.900 align:start position:0%
so now we come to item
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
23001 Department of Education is there
 
00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:58.080 align:start position:0%

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:17.580 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald is recognized for a
 
00:22:19.909 --> 00:22:19.919 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman good
 
00:22:19.919 --> 00:22:21.409 align:start position:0%
question thank you Mr chairman good
afternoon

00:22:21.409 --> 00:22:21.419 align:start position:0%
afternoon
 
00:22:25.909 --> 00:22:25.919 align:start position:0%
um of of the 1.6 million dollars that we
 
00:22:31.210 --> 00:22:31.220 align:start position:0%
appropriated in 2019 how much has been
 
00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860 align:start position:0%
sent out to school districts
 
00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:38.700 align:start position:0%
and second part of the question is what
 
00:22:42.049 --> 00:22:42.059 align:start position:0%
is the Department's plan to move the
 
00:22:45.529 --> 00:22:45.539 align:start position:0%
rest of the money to Abate lead
 
00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:48.000 align:start position:0%
great thank you for that question so of
 
00:22:49.730 --> 00:22:49.740 align:start position:0%
the 1.6 million which was approved I
 
00:22:51.169 --> 00:22:51.179 align:start position:0%
believe actually it was even earlier
 
00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:52.520 align:start position:0%
than that in 2018
 
00:22:57.649 --> 00:22:57.659 align:start position:0%
we've spent 74 930 dollars we have three
 
00:23:00.470 --> 00:23:00.480 align:start position:0%
uh schools that have submissions that
 
00:23:02.690 --> 00:23:02.700 align:start position:0%
are pending with Des for approval that
 
00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
will be sent over to us and we'll be
 
00:23:06.289 --> 00:23:06.299 align:start position:0%
bringing those to you
 
00:23:09.289 --> 00:23:09.299 align:start position:0%
um and then so the that is how we've
 
00:23:11.870 --> 00:23:11.880 align:start position:0%
used the funds so far in some respects
 
00:23:14.149 --> 00:23:14.159 align:start position:0%
that's actually a good thing which means
 
00:23:15.890 --> 00:23:15.900 align:start position:0%
that we have tested for lead and we've
 
00:23:19.070 --> 00:23:19.080 align:start position:0%
not found lead in the school system so
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
we've not needed all of those funds to
 
00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:24.240 align:start position:0%
remediate lead in the schools as you
 
00:23:25.850 --> 00:23:25.860 align:start position:0%
know last year in the legislative
 
00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:28.200 align:start position:0%
session they changed the the
 
00:23:30.049 --> 00:23:30.059 align:start position:0%
requirements for the testing from 15
 
00:23:32.330 --> 00:23:32.340 align:start position:0%
parts per million to or billion to five
 
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:33.900 align:start position:0%
parts per billion
 
00:23:36.470 --> 00:23:36.480 align:start position:0%
um those testing results will be coming
 
00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:39.980 align:start position:0%
back to us between now and June of 2024
 
00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:42.480 align:start position:0%
so we do think it's prudent to leave the
 
00:23:44.210 --> 00:23:44.220 align:start position:0%
funding on the book so as we've lowered
 
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:45.720 align:start position:0%
those standards there may be additional
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
schools that are seeking
 
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740 align:start position:0%
um you know some support in terms of
 
00:23:53.870 --> 00:23:53.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:58.310 --> 00:23:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:04.260 align:start position:0%
Care Centers have any applied or is the
 
00:24:07.789 --> 00:24:07.799 align:start position:0%
department reaching out to them to
 
00:24:10.430 --> 00:24:10.440 align:start position:0%
try and bring them on board to do the
 
00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:13.320 align:start position:0%
testing and Remediation yeah so that the
 
00:24:15.529 --> 00:24:15.539 align:start position:0%
it is available to Child Care Centers
 
00:24:16.970 --> 00:24:16.980 align:start position:0%
um the question might be better directed
 
00:24:20.029 --> 00:24:20.039 align:start position:0%
to someone from Des the Des is the ones
 
00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:21.840 align:start position:0%
who collects the samples and they submit
 
00:24:23.630 --> 00:24:23.640 align:start position:0%
them to us for the reimbursement process
 
00:24:25.610 --> 00:24:25.620 align:start position:0%
and so we're kind of on the back end of
 
00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:26.690 align:start position:0%
and so we're kind of on the back end of
that

00:24:26.690 --> 00:24:26.700 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:28.370 --> 00:24:28.380 align:start position:0%
um so I don't know the answer but I can
 
00:24:30.230 --> 00:24:30.240 align:start position:0%
get the answer for you in terms of any
 
00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:31.620 align:start position:0%
child care centers that have taken
 
00:24:33.350 --> 00:24:33.360 align:start position:0%
advantage of the program coming right
 
00:24:34.490 --> 00:24:34.500 align:start position:0%
behind you
 
00:24:37.669 --> 00:24:37.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:39.600 align:start position:0%
provide a quick answer Cynthia cleven's
 
00:24:41.350 --> 00:24:41.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Des engineering section
 
00:24:43.850 --> 00:24:43.860 align:start position:0%
this particular funding is only
 
00:24:45.830 --> 00:24:45.840 align:start position:0%
available for schools both private and
 
00:24:48.529 --> 00:24:48.539 align:start position:0%
public schools because it was uh the
 
00:24:49.909 --> 00:24:49.919 align:start position:0%
application was by the Department of
 
00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:56.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:58.380 align:start position:0%
I'll I'll follow up on that because my
 
00:24:59.690 --> 00:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
understanding is that child care centers
 
00:25:01.970 --> 00:25:01.980 align:start position:0%
were included in the the opportunity
 
00:25:04.789 --> 00:25:04.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:08.330 --> 00:25:08.340 align:start position:0%

all right moving on to
 
00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:29.700 align:start position:0%
the next removed item
 
00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:34.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:53.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:54.529 --> 00:25:54.539 align:start position:0%
good afternoon members of the committee
 
00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:57.419 align:start position:0%
Nathan white DHHS CFO
 
00:26:00.710 --> 00:26:00.720 align:start position:0%
and we welcome Health and Human Services
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
introduce yourself
 
00:26:14.649 --> 00:26:14.659 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:16.850 --> 00:26:16.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:26:19.490 --> 00:26:19.500 align:start position:0%
uh I I was I was just trying to
 
00:26:22.970 --> 00:26:22.980 align:start position:0%
understand uh the uh cash flow part of
 
00:26:26.330 --> 00:26:26.340 align:start position:0%
this because we've merged in this
 
00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
language both cash benefits and medical
 
00:26:33.710 --> 00:26:33.720 align:start position:0%
benefits and so I can understand how a
 
00:26:35.750 --> 00:26:35.760 align:start position:0%
cash benefit might go to an individual
 
00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:40.140 align:start position:0%
Refugee or their family but how how do
 
00:26:44.769 --> 00:26:44.779 align:start position:0%
we process the payments for medical care
 
00:26:47.149 --> 00:26:47.159 align:start position:0%
I don't think this goes through Medicaid
 
00:26:49.730 --> 00:26:49.740 align:start position:0%
we're not reimbursing Medicaid how how
 
00:26:52.430 --> 00:26:52.440 align:start position:0%
does this money end up flowing
 
00:26:56.269 --> 00:26:56.279 align:start position:0%
eventually to the provider
 
00:26:56.279 --> 00:26:58.090 align:start position:0%
eventually to the provider
foreign

00:26:58.090 --> 00:26:58.100 align:start position:0%
foreign
 
00:26:59.690 --> 00:26:59.700 align:start position:0%
thank you for that question
 
00:27:01.549 --> 00:27:01.559 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards um you're correct
 
00:27:02.690 --> 00:27:02.700 align:start position:0%
it doesn't
 
00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:05.940 align:start position:0%
go through our these these individuals
 
00:27:08.149 --> 00:27:08.159 align:start position:0%
are eligible for Medicaid but then if
 
00:27:10.130 --> 00:27:10.140 align:start position:0%
their earnings exceed and that would go
 
00:27:11.990 --> 00:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
through our regular channels and if
 
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:14.580 align:start position:0%
their earnings are exceed um what makes
 
00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.440 align:start position:0%
them and causes them to be ineligible
 
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:19.440 align:start position:0%
for Medicaid then they are eligible for
 
00:27:20.750 --> 00:27:20.760 align:start position:0%
the um
 
00:27:23.269 --> 00:27:23.279 align:start position:0%
the cash assistance under the Met under
 
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:25.200 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid I mean I'm sorry under the
 
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:28.140 align:start position:0%
medical assistance I'm not entirely sure
 
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:29.700 align:start position:0%
and I can get back to you on the exact
 
00:27:31.850 --> 00:27:31.860 align:start position:0%
process unless you are on how they
 
00:27:33.649 --> 00:27:33.659 align:start position:0%
receive that money it was my
 
00:27:33.659 --> 00:27:34.789 align:start position:0%
receive that money it was my
understanding

00:27:34.789 --> 00:27:34.799 align:start position:0%
understanding
 
00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:36.240 align:start position:0%
um through vendors that pay the
 
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
providers but I need to check on that I
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
I would appreciate that I'm just looking
 
00:27:42.529 --> 00:27:42.539 align:start position:0%
for what the internal controls are
 
00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:44.820 align:start position:0%
around the on the workflow the process
 
00:27:46.490 --> 00:27:46.500 align:start position:0%
of getting the money to the provider
 
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:48.840 align:start position:0%
that's all and then a second question
 
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:54.120 align:start position:0%
for me follow up now uh I I have heard
 
00:27:57.409 --> 00:27:57.419 align:start position:0%
that our the refugees or guests of our
 
00:28:00.529 --> 00:28:00.539 align:start position:0%
country are prohibited from working
 
00:28:04.909 --> 00:28:04.919 align:start position:0%
seeking official employment uh is that
 
00:28:08.029 --> 00:28:08.039 align:start position:0%
the case can these individuals go get
 
00:28:11.269 --> 00:28:11.279 align:start position:0%
jobs and maybe come off of the the
 
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:13.080 align:start position:0%
welfare role
 
00:28:17.510 --> 00:28:17.520 align:start position:0%
yes absolutely we um these individuals
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
are coming in and looking for employment
 
00:28:21.110 --> 00:28:21.120 align:start position:0%
their supportive employment programs
 
00:28:23.930 --> 00:28:23.940 align:start position:0%
through some of our vendors with that we
 
00:28:26.570 --> 00:28:26.580 align:start position:0%
give other funds to to help with job
 
00:28:28.909 --> 00:28:28.919 align:start position:0%
employment and and case manage their
 
00:28:28.919 --> 00:28:29.870 align:start position:0%
employment and and case manage their
ability

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:29.880 align:start position:0%
ability
 
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:31.620 align:start position:0%
um and we track all that information so
 
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:34.860 align:start position:0%
as as they as stated if they become
 
00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:37.020 align:start position:0%
ineligible during because of earnings
 
00:28:39.409 --> 00:28:39.419 align:start position:0%
they are no longer require this
 
00:28:39.419 --> 00:28:40.669 align:start position:0%
they are no longer require this
assistance

00:28:40.669 --> 00:28:40.679 align:start position:0%
assistance
 
00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:42.720 align:start position:0%

Motion in a second to approve item 23025
 
00:30:08.810 --> 00:30:08.820 align:start position:0%
further discussion from committees
 
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:10.440 align:start position:0%
seeing Nani ready for the question all
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
in favor say aye
 
00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:13.559 align:start position:0%
oppose no
 
00:30:19.789 --> 00:30:19.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:21.789 --> 00:30:21.799 align:start position:0%
next we'll move on to 0
 
00:30:28.310 --> 00:30:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.850 align:start position:0%
 
31.

00:30:31.850 --> 00:30:31.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:35.149 --> 00:30:35.159 align:start position:0%
and I I see questions again by
 
00:30:39.769 --> 00:30:39.779 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.049 --> 00:30:42.059 align:start position:0%
31 then as representative Edwards and
 
00:30:44.269 --> 00:30:44.279 align:start position:0%
irf I had both of you down
 
00:30:46.370 --> 00:30:46.380 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards is recognized for
 
00:30:49.389 --> 00:30:49.399 align:start position:0%
a question I I I'm I'm not really
 
00:30:53.450 --> 00:30:53.460 align:start position:0%
opposed to this uh but I I do think the
 
00:30:55.430 --> 00:30:55.440 align:start position:0%
public kind of needs to understand what
 
00:30:58.970 --> 00:30:58.980 align:start position:0%
we're doing here we're taking 318 if I
 
00:31:02.930 --> 00:31:02.940 align:start position:0%
understand this right we're taking 318
 
00:31:05.990 --> 00:31:06.000 align:start position:0%
000 because the people who are currently
 
00:31:09.590 --> 00:31:09.600 align:start position:0%
enrolled in WIC know they're in WIC are
 
00:31:12.529 --> 00:31:12.539 align:start position:0%
under leveraging their WIC benefits so
 
00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:16.500 align:start position:0%
we're going to take 318 000 to pay a
 
00:31:18.649 --> 00:31:18.659 align:start position:0%
contractor who's not going to provide
 
00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:22.260 align:start position:0%
any food but that contractor is going to
 
00:31:25.250 --> 00:31:25.260 align:start position:0%
tell the existing WIC people go use your
 
00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
WIC card I it's a bit of a Layman
 
00:31:31.070 --> 00:31:31.080 align:start position:0%
description but is it accurate
 
00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
um thank you representative Edwards I I
 
00:31:34.789 --> 00:31:34.799 align:start position:0%
would not characterize it as fully
 
00:31:36.590 --> 00:31:36.600 align:start position:0%
accurate the the points you're making
 
00:31:38.149 --> 00:31:38.159 align:start position:0%
are correct yes we're bringing in money
 
00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:41.700 align:start position:0%
we are using those funds in help make
 
00:31:43.669 --> 00:31:43.679 align:start position:0%
sure that all of our WIC participants
 
00:31:46.970 --> 00:31:46.980 align:start position:0%
understand how to use their benefits
 
00:31:49.549 --> 00:31:49.559 align:start position:0%
um WIC is unlike snap for example we
 
00:31:51.710 --> 00:31:51.720 align:start position:0%
don't just give a blank dollar amount
 
00:31:53.810 --> 00:31:53.820 align:start position:0%
there is a prescription essentially made
 
00:31:56.149 --> 00:31:56.159 align:start position:0%
for everyone who participates because in
 
00:31:57.889 --> 00:31:57.899 align:start position:0%
essence not only is it to provide
 
00:31:59.990 --> 00:32:00.000 align:start position:0%
supplemental food it's also for the
 
00:32:01.730 --> 00:32:01.740 align:start position:0%
nutrition education that goes with it
 
00:32:03.529 --> 00:32:03.539 align:start position:0%
that's what makes it different than a
 
00:32:05.570 --> 00:32:05.580 align:start position:0%
cash assistance program it really is to
 
00:32:07.789 --> 00:32:07.799 align:start position:0%
make sure in this particular vulnerable
 
00:32:09.769 --> 00:32:09.779 align:start position:0%
population pregnant women young children
 
00:32:12.230 --> 00:32:12.240 align:start position:0%
that they have the food that they need
 
00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:14.820 align:start position:0%
that meets their Developmental and
 
00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:17.940 align:start position:0%
growth needs so with these funds we've
 
00:32:17.940 --> 00:32:19.149 align:start position:0%
growth needs so with these funds we've
noticed

00:32:19.149 --> 00:32:19.159 align:start position:0%
noticed
 
00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:22.200 align:start position:0%
that folks are not utilizing all of
 
00:32:25.490 --> 00:32:25.500 align:start position:0%
their WIC benefits that could be in part
 
00:32:27.409 --> 00:32:27.419 align:start position:0%
because we've had additional SNAP
 
00:32:28.850 --> 00:32:28.860 align:start position:0%
benefits over the public health
 
00:32:32.029 --> 00:32:32.039 align:start position:0%
emergency and so folks may not feel the
 
00:32:34.310 --> 00:32:34.320 align:start position:0%
need to use all of the more prescriptive
 
00:32:37.970 --> 00:32:37.980 align:start position:0%
WIC benefits as we end the public health
 
00:32:40.310 --> 00:32:40.320 align:start position:0%
emergency we want to make sure that
 
00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:43.320 align:start position:0%
people know the benefits that they have
 
00:32:45.529 --> 00:32:45.539 align:start position:0%
how to navigate through the stores to
 
00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
find what they need and ultimately to
 
00:32:50.830 --> 00:32:50.840 align:start position:0%
get the nutrition nutrient dense food
 
00:32:54.409 --> 00:32:54.419 align:start position:0%
that that is appropriate for them and
 
00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:55.559 align:start position:0%
their children
 
00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:57.529 align:start position:0%
their children
follow

00:32:57.529 --> 00:32:57.539 align:start position:0%
follow
 
00:33:00.289 --> 00:33:00.299 align:start position:0%
up so I always appreciate your your
 
00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:02.520 align:start position:0%
added Precision thank you you just made
 
00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:05.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire smarter okay so so my next
 
00:33:08.870 --> 00:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
question is is there something that
 
00:33:11.990 --> 00:33:12.000 align:start position:0%
backs up the 318 is the right amount I
 
00:33:15.470 --> 00:33:15.480 align:start position:0%
mean why why isn't it 220 000 why isn't
 
00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:19.140 align:start position:0%
it 450 000. how do we assess the need to
 
00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:21.000 align:start position:0%
be three hundred and eighteen thousand
 
00:33:23.630 --> 00:33:23.640 align:start position:0%
dollars sure this is a formula from the
 
00:33:26.690 --> 00:33:26.700 align:start position:0%
universe Forum USDA and so these are the
 
00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
funds that were and this is what's
 
00:33:30.409 --> 00:33:30.419 align:start position:0%
available to us and so we back up and
 
00:33:31.850 --> 00:33:31.860 align:start position:0%
say what's appropriate for New Hampshire
 
00:33:34.250 --> 00:33:34.260 align:start position:0%
in that but it was a formula funded
 
00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:40.430 --> 00:33:40.440 align:start position:0%

00:35:19.849 --> 00:35:19.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
00:35:21.410 --> 00:35:21.420 align:start position:0%
hearing today
 
00:35:24.349 --> 00:35:24.359 align:start position:0%
so I had a number of questions
 
00:35:26.810 --> 00:35:26.820 align:start position:0%
with your request under the
 
00:35:30.410 --> 00:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
administration division you show uh
 
00:35:33.050 --> 00:35:33.060 align:start position:0%
salaries temporary employees that's on
 
00:35:35.870 --> 00:35:35.880 align:start position:0%
the second page this current budget of
 
00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:39.240 align:start position:0%
zero and it's going to 354 thousand
 
00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:40.310 align:start position:0%
zero and it's going to 354 thousand
dollars

00:35:40.310 --> 00:35:40.320 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:42.780 align:start position:0%
and you can kind of carry that through
 
00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
down to the division of Licensing below
 
00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
you have another salary temporary
 
00:35:51.410 --> 00:35:51.420 align:start position:0%
employees it's going from zero to a
 
00:35:53.990 --> 00:35:54.000 align:start position:0%
hundred and ninety two thousand dollars
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
and yet on the back page I believe it's
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
page five
 
00:36:03.550 --> 00:36:03.560 align:start position:0%
you list 21 new positions it says but
 
00:36:07.790 --> 00:36:07.800 align:start position:0%
they're existing positions so I'm a
 
00:36:09.950 --> 00:36:09.960 align:start position:0%
little confused where it says existing
 
00:36:11.930 --> 00:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
but you've got this additional money and
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
if we didn't approve this request we'd
 
00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:17.400 align:start position:0%
be returning about 1.4 million dollars
 
00:36:19.550 --> 00:36:19.560 align:start position:0%
to the general fund so I was hoping for
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
an explanation Mr chairman thank you
 
00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:24.359 align:start position:0%
absolutely thank you representative for
 
00:36:26.030 --> 00:36:26.040 align:start position:0%
the question so
 
00:36:28.310 --> 00:36:28.320 align:start position:0%
um just to take a step back oplc has
 
00:36:31.010 --> 00:36:31.020 align:start position:0%
really two broad initiatives that we're
 
00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:32.880 align:start position:0%
working on that are rather time
 
00:36:35.270 --> 00:36:35.280 align:start position:0%
sensitive the first and I think you've
 
00:36:37.250 --> 00:36:37.260 align:start position:0%
all probably read the audit from the
 
00:36:39.349 --> 00:36:39.359 align:start position:0%
board of dental examiners
 
00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:41.820 align:start position:0%
um and recognize uh what we know in the
 
00:36:43.310 --> 00:36:43.320 align:start position:0%
office which is that there's been a
 
00:36:44.870 --> 00:36:44.880 align:start position:0%
complete lack of internal controls at
 
00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
the board level as well as the agency
 
00:36:48.410 --> 00:36:48.420 align:start position:0%
levels so we have prioritized
 
00:36:50.710 --> 00:36:50.720 align:start position:0%
establishing internal controls
 
00:36:53.150 --> 00:36:53.160 align:start position:0%
and that is a project that we're working
 
00:36:55.250 --> 00:36:55.260 align:start position:0%
on expeditiously which leads into our
 
00:36:56.870 --> 00:36:56.880 align:start position:0%
second initiative that was also
 
00:36:58.550 --> 00:36:58.560 align:start position:0%
recognized by the audit which is that
 
00:37:00.589 --> 00:37:00.599 align:start position:0%
the current technology operated by the
 
00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:02.220 align:start position:0%
office which is an Enterprise solution
 
00:37:04.550 --> 00:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
does not meet the state's needs so
 
00:37:07.069 --> 00:37:07.079 align:start position:0%
recently governor and Council approved a
 
00:37:09.829 --> 00:37:09.839 align:start position:0%
new contract to procure a new solution
 
00:37:13.010 --> 00:37:13.020 align:start position:0%
and we will be migrating over the next
 
00:37:16.970 --> 00:37:16.980 align:start position:0%
two years with a new solution the issue
 
00:37:20.089 --> 00:37:20.099 align:start position:0%
is that we don't want to migrate bad
 
00:37:23.450 --> 00:37:23.460 align:start position:0%
data we don't want to migrate improper
 
00:37:26.030 --> 00:37:26.040 align:start position:0%
information one of my observations has
 
00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:29.160 align:start position:0%
been that years ago when our technology
 
00:37:33.290 --> 00:37:33.300 align:start position:0%
was set up it was not the requirements
 
00:37:35.630 --> 00:37:35.640 align:start position:0%
were not correct they have been modified
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
over many years to not be consistent
 
00:37:40.490 --> 00:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
with statute and rules and so as part of
 
00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.400 align:start position:0%
our internal controls project we are
 
00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:46.260 align:start position:0%
reviewing an inventory in all statutory
 
00:37:48.109 --> 00:37:48.119 align:start position:0%
and regulatory requirements for both the
 
00:37:51.349 --> 00:37:51.359 align:start position:0%
agency but as well as our boards in the
 
00:37:53.810 --> 00:37:53.820 align:start position:0%
mean in order to meet the time frames to
 
00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:55.980 align:start position:0%
migrate clean information and correct
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
information over to the new system this
 
00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:00.960 align:start position:0%
requires this is a significant project
 
00:38:03.950 --> 00:38:03.960 align:start position:0%
that requires additional support from a
 
00:38:06.010 --> 00:38:06.020 align:start position:0%
temporary nature
 
00:38:08.390 --> 00:38:08.400 align:start position:0%
because we have to continue operations
 
00:38:10.670 --> 00:38:10.680 align:start position:0%
as is while we're focused on basically
 
00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:12.420 align:start position:0%
our cleanup project
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
so what we did is we established some
 
00:38:18.650 --> 00:38:18.660 align:start position:0%
eight T positions that are temporary up
 
00:38:21.109 --> 00:38:21.119 align:start position:0%
to 52 weeks that do not that are not
 
00:38:24.530 --> 00:38:24.540 align:start position:0%
required to go before fiscal
 
00:38:26.750 --> 00:38:26.760 align:start position:0%
um we have not obviously filled the
 
00:38:30.470 --> 00:38:30.480 align:start position:0%
positions yet this request is to seek
 
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:32.760 align:start position:0%
transfer funds or basically budget and
 
00:38:34.670 --> 00:38:34.680 align:start position:0%
expense so we have Appropriations for
 
00:38:38.270 --> 00:38:38.280 align:start position:0%
those positions I don't anticipate
 
00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:38.950 align:start position:0%
those positions I don't anticipate
um

00:38:38.950 --> 00:38:38.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:38:42.230 --> 00:38:42.240 align:start position:0%
requiring it's not it's not yet known
 
00:38:44.630 --> 00:38:44.640 align:start position:0%
whether we will require these positions
 
00:38:46.910 --> 00:38:46.920 align:start position:0%
beyond the 52 weeks if we do then
 
00:38:48.710 --> 00:38:48.720 align:start position:0%
obviously we will seek to convert them
 
00:38:50.870 --> 00:38:50.880 align:start position:0%
to 90s which will require that we bring
 
00:38:52.670 --> 00:38:52.680 align:start position:0%
this request before the committee to
 
00:38:54.530 --> 00:38:54.540 align:start position:0%
create the positions but at that time
 
00:38:58.730 --> 00:38:58.740 align:start position:0%
that's That's the basis for the request
 
00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:00.960 align:start position:0%
further question Mr chairman for the
 
00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:02.900 align:start position:0%
question thank you
 
00:39:08.150 --> 00:39:08.160 align:start position:0%
you also show agency income up about 350
 
00:39:11.329 --> 00:39:11.339 align:start position:0%
000 is that business is up so to speak
 
00:39:14.210 --> 00:39:14.220 align:start position:0%
or are you assessing new fees
 
00:39:16.910 --> 00:39:16.920 align:start position:0%
we are not assessing new fees um so the
 
00:39:20.810 --> 00:39:20.820 align:start position:0%
income so as as the committee knows oplc
 
00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:22.740 align:start position:0%
is self-funded
 
00:39:25.250 --> 00:39:25.260 align:start position:0%
um we have not significantly modified
 
00:39:27.890 --> 00:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
any fees because there's been a lack of
 
00:39:30.890 --> 00:39:30.900 align:start position:0%
Clarity over who has statutory statutory
 
00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:33.839 align:start position:0%
authority to modify thieves as between
 
00:39:35.750 --> 00:39:35.760 align:start position:0%
the boards and the agencies so we've
 
00:39:37.370 --> 00:39:37.380 align:start position:0%
worked with the legislature there was a
 
00:39:38.930 --> 00:39:38.940 align:start position:0%
there was a Committee created last year
 
00:39:40.849 --> 00:39:40.859 align:start position:0%
to look at that issue and and there's
 
00:39:43.069 --> 00:39:43.079 align:start position:0%
Bill pending that would resolve that so
 
00:39:44.870 --> 00:39:44.880 align:start position:0%
we have not made any significant changes
 
00:39:47.270 --> 00:39:47.280 align:start position:0%
regarding fees the concern has been
 
00:39:49.849 --> 00:39:49.859 align:start position:0%
always that some boards are meeting
 
00:39:51.410 --> 00:39:51.420 align:start position:0%
their costs some boards are incredibly
 
00:39:53.030 --> 00:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
exceeding their costs and some boards
 
00:39:55.310 --> 00:39:55.320 align:start position:0%
are not meeting their costs the result
 
00:39:57.470 --> 00:39:57.480 align:start position:0%
of that is that the agency historically
 
00:39:59.390 --> 00:39:59.400 align:start position:0%
has lacked significant funds to the
 
00:40:01.970 --> 00:40:01.980 align:start position:0%
general fund 2016 it was 4.8 million
 
00:40:05.890 --> 00:40:05.900 align:start position:0%
dollars 2017 it was 5.6 2018 it was 5.5
 
00:40:09.109 --> 00:40:09.119 align:start position:0%
2019 we didn't last any money due to a
 
00:40:11.210 --> 00:40:11.220 align:start position:0%
statutory change that converts our lapse
 
00:40:15.109 --> 00:40:15.119 align:start position:0%
to every biennium last year or 2020 we
 
00:40:17.569 --> 00:40:17.579 align:start position:0%
left seven million approximately for two
 
00:40:19.910 --> 00:40:19.920 align:start position:0%
years and last year he laughs about four
 
00:40:22.190 --> 00:40:22.200 align:start position:0%

is and after the fact general fund grant
 
00:42:30.190 --> 00:42:30.200 align:start position:0%

the project
 
00:42:52.550 --> 00:42:52.560 align:start position:0%
so for instance if there was a town that
 
00:42:55.250 --> 00:42:55.260 align:start position:0%
had a 10 million dollar project they
 
00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
received five million dollars from rural
 
00:43:00.050 --> 00:43:00.060 align:start position:0%
development they received a grant of two
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
million dollars from us their debt net
 
00:43:04.190 --> 00:43:04.200 align:start position:0%
Debt Service is three million dollars we
 
00:43:07.370 --> 00:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
would pay 20 on that debt service
 
00:43:10.250 --> 00:43:10.260 align:start position:0%
and that would be on an annual basis per
 
00:43:12.770 --> 00:43:12.780 align:start position:0%
Debt Service payment
 
00:43:15.770 --> 00:43:15.780 align:start position:0%
and this is some part of that no
 
00:43:18.650 --> 00:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
what this is is this is a Federal grant
 
00:43:21.490 --> 00:43:21.500 align:start position:0%
program on the front end of the program
 
00:43:27.050 --> 00:43:27.060 align:start position:0%

changes either in urging contaminants
 
00:43:33.950 --> 00:43:33.960 align:start position:0%
to deal with that or in this case we
 
00:43:36.770 --> 00:43:36.780 align:start position:0%
were given additional money from EPA to
 
00:43:40.849 --> 00:43:40.859 align:start position:0%

00:46:00.410 --> 00:46:00.420 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:46:03.410 --> 00:46:03.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for appearing
 
00:46:03.420 --> 00:46:04.790 align:start position:0%
thank you for appearing
so

00:46:04.790 --> 00:46:04.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:46:06.950 --> 00:46:06.960 align:start position:0%
um I did receive a response to my
 
00:46:09.109 --> 00:46:09.119 align:start position:0%
question concerning the liquify liquid
 
00:46:12.910 --> 00:46:12.920 align:start position:0%
damages the MCO liquid damages
 
00:46:15.950 --> 00:46:15.960 align:start position:0%
in your response that could lead to a
 
00:46:18.050 --> 00:46:18.060 align:start position:0%
one thousand dollar penalty per
 
00:46:20.390 --> 00:46:20.400 align:start position:0%
occurrence which kind of caught my
 
00:46:22.609 --> 00:46:22.619 align:start position:0%
attention because you got 1.4 million
 
00:46:25.609 --> 00:46:25.619 align:start position:0%
dollars in that on that line so it seems
 
00:46:28.069 --> 00:46:28.079 align:start position:0%
like are there that many penalties that
 
00:46:30.650 --> 00:46:30.660 align:start position:0%
you need to set aside 1.4 million
 
00:46:30.660 --> 00:46:32.690 align:start position:0%
you need to set aside 1.4 million
dollars

00:46:32.690 --> 00:46:32.700 align:start position:0%

thank you for the question
 
00:46:35.809 --> 00:46:35.819 align:start position:0%

the just to give you some sense of skill
 
00:46:44.390 --> 00:46:44.400 align:start position:0%
the Medicaid Managed Care contract you
 
00:46:46.490 --> 00:46:46.500 align:start position:0%
know with currently the price limitation
 
00:46:48.650 --> 00:46:48.660 align:start position:0%
under the current version is over 1.3
 
00:46:50.470 --> 00:46:50.480 align:start position:0%
billion dollars
 
00:46:55.970 --> 00:46:55.980 align:start position:0%
we have a very large set of performance
 
00:46:58.390 --> 00:46:58.400 align:start position:0%
standards and
 
00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
we monitor them on a monthly basis and
 
00:47:05.690 --> 00:47:05.700 align:start position:0%
so when when there is an opportunity
 
00:47:07.370 --> 00:47:07.380 align:start position:0%
that they're not meeting what they're
 
00:47:09.650 --> 00:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
required to do then we apply it it's a
 
00:47:13.250 --> 00:47:13.260 align:start position:0%
it's considered a remedy because there's
 
00:47:15.950 --> 00:47:15.960 align:start position:0%
really the the standards defined and if
 
00:47:18.589 --> 00:47:18.599 align:start position:0%
they don't meet it then we just collect
 
00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
it subsequently
 
00:47:23.690 --> 00:47:23.700 align:start position:0%

00:48:21.470 --> 00:48:21.480 align:start position:0%
um on the third page
 
00:48:25.010 --> 00:48:25.020 align:start position:0%
on the class zero three seven
 
00:48:26.930 --> 00:48:26.940 align:start position:0%
it's for the tablets
 
00:48:29.630 --> 00:48:29.640 align:start position:0%
and I one I want to thank you for
 
00:48:32.870 --> 00:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
enumerating that there are 13 of them in
 
00:48:35.630 --> 00:48:35.640 align:start position:0%
previous submissions and prior years the
 
00:48:38.990 --> 00:48:39.000 align:start position:0%
quantity was often uh sort of obfuscated
 
00:48:40.790 --> 00:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
and we couldn't really tell so I
 
00:48:43.609 --> 00:48:43.619 align:start position:0%
appreciate the specificity thank you
 
00:48:43.619 --> 00:48:44.270 align:start position:0%
appreciate the specificity thank you
um

00:48:44.270 --> 00:48:44.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:47.579 align:start position:0%
what what I'm asking about is this fifty
 
00:48:50.569 --> 00:48:50.579 align:start position:0%
thousand dollars are are are we
 
00:48:52.910 --> 00:48:52.920 align:start position:0%
anticipating that these tablets are
 
00:48:55.849 --> 00:48:55.859 align:start position:0%
essentially disposable or are we going
 
00:48:59.329 --> 00:48:59.339 align:start position:0%
to be uh including them in the permanent
 
00:49:02.569 --> 00:49:02.579 align:start position:0%
inventory of of the state and they're
 
00:49:04.010 --> 00:49:04.020 align:start position:0%
going to be on a maintenance plan we're
 
00:49:06.530 --> 00:49:06.540 align:start position:0%
going to rotate them or replace them
 
00:49:08.390 --> 00:49:08.400 align:start position:0%
over time
 
00:49:09.890 --> 00:49:09.900 align:start position:0%
very much for that question again for
 
00:49:11.450 --> 00:49:11.460 align:start position:0%
the record Patricia Tilley director of
 
00:49:13.190 --> 00:49:13.200 align:start position:0%
Public Health so thanks representative
 
00:49:15.109 --> 00:49:15.119 align:start position:0%
Edwards as noted we have a number of
 
00:49:16.430 --> 00:49:16.440 align:start position:0%
tablets here that we want to make
 
00:49:19.250 --> 00:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
available to the 10 County Jail systems
 
00:49:21.650 --> 00:49:21.660 align:start position:0%
as well as the three State Correctional
 
00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:23.880 align:start position:0%
Facility so that's the total of the 13
 
00:49:26.329 --> 00:49:26.339 align:start position:0%
that we're talking about
 
00:49:29.809 --> 00:49:29.819 align:start position:0%
um in terms of what their lifespan it's
 
00:49:31.910 --> 00:49:31.920 align:start position:0%
it is not anticipated that this
 
00:49:34.190 --> 00:49:34.200 align:start position:0%
particular pot of money will continue to
 
00:49:36.170 --> 00:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
support those odd infant items that
 
00:49:38.809 --> 00:49:38.819 align:start position:0%
these are being given and provided to
 
00:49:40.970 --> 00:49:40.980 align:start position:0%
each of the correctional facilities to
 
00:49:43.130 --> 00:49:43.140 align:start position:0%
ensure that they have access to the
 
00:49:45.349 --> 00:49:45.359 align:start position:0%
technology they need for the
 
00:49:47.829 --> 00:49:47.839 align:start position:0%
correctional officers to get the
 
00:49:50.809 --> 00:49:50.819 align:start position:0%
Infectious Disease training that is
 
00:49:52.970 --> 00:49:52.980 align:start position:0%
required or that is needed and certainly
 
00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:54.980 align:start position:0%
has been an added need throughout
 
00:49:58.609 --> 00:49:58.619 align:start position:0%
covid-19 the state facilities will
 
00:50:00.530 --> 00:50:00.540 align:start position:0%
likely have a certain plan for
 
00:50:02.809 --> 00:50:02.819 align:start position:0%
disposition the county facilities will
 
00:50:04.730 --> 00:50:04.740 align:start position:0%
likely have a different plan for
 
00:50:07.010 --> 00:50:07.020 align:start position:0%
disposition that you know in terms of
 
00:50:09.170 --> 00:50:09.180 align:start position:0%
the way that those function for the
 
00:50:11.630 --> 00:50:11.640 align:start position:0%
purposes of this grant this is a one and
 
00:50:12.890 --> 00:50:12.900 align:start position:0%
done we're going to give them these
 
00:50:14.510 --> 00:50:14.520 align:start position:0%
tablets we want to make sure that these
 
00:50:16.849 --> 00:50:16.859 align:start position:0%
that this training occurs over the next
 
00:50:19.190 --> 00:50:19.200 align:start position:0%
couple of years okay so it's a small
 
00:50:20.809 --> 00:50:20.819 align:start position:0%
amount of money and I'm not I'm not
 
00:50:22.970 --> 00:50:22.980 align:start position:0%
obsessing on a small amount of money I'm
 
00:50:24.530 --> 00:50:24.540 align:start position:0%
just trying to make sure that there's a
 
00:50:26.809 --> 00:50:26.819 align:start position:0%
consistent principle that when we do a
 
00:50:28.609 --> 00:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
one-time investment with Federal money
 
00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:30.900 align:start position:0%
that we're aware of what the long-term
 
00:50:32.809 --> 00:50:32.819 align:start position:0%
maintenance tail is and if that
 
00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:34.740 align:start position:0%
maintenance tail is the obligation of
 
00:50:36.770 --> 00:50:36.780 align:start position:0%
the general funds or not I don't believe
 
00:50:38.569 --> 00:50:38.579 align:start position:0%
that this would be the obligation of the
 
00:50:41.230 --> 00:50:41.240 align:start position:0%
general funds okay thank you and then
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
the in-person training described in 37
 
00:50:47.329 --> 00:50:47.339 align:start position:0%
is probably much narrower than what will
 
00:50:49.450 --> 00:50:49.460 align:start position:0%
really happen it just talks about
 
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:53.880 align:start position:0%
there'll be uh training on prevention of
 
00:50:57.170 --> 00:50:57.180 align:start position:0%
covid-19 I think you implied it's a
 
00:50:59.569 --> 00:50:59.579 align:start position:0%
broader topic on infectious diseases
 
00:51:02.030 --> 00:51:02.040 align:start position:0%
correct yes correct it'll be a broader
 
00:51:03.410 --> 00:51:03.420 align:start position:0%
topic it's across all infectious
 
00:51:05.990 --> 00:51:06.000 align:start position:0%
diseases inclusive of covid-19 and this
 
00:51:07.069 --> 00:51:07.079 align:start position:0%
is really going to be a train the
 
00:51:08.450 --> 00:51:08.460 align:start position:0%
trainer model so there'll be some in
 
00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.160 align:start position:0%
person but the tablets are really there
 
00:51:13.309 --> 00:51:13.319 align:start position:0%
so that those people that get the
 
00:51:16.370 --> 00:51:16.380 align:start position:0%
trainer training can go and share that
 
00:51:18.710 --> 00:51:18.720 align:start position:0%
with their colleagues back in their own
 
00:51:21.170 --> 00:51:21.180 align:start position:0%
facilities so so thank you for that one
 
00:51:23.390 --> 00:51:23.400 align:start position:0%
one of the reasons I I sometimes will
 
00:51:25.370 --> 00:51:25.380 align:start position:0%
pick something so narrow and and dig
 
00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:28.260 align:start position:0%
into it is is just to test whether or
 
00:51:31.010 --> 00:51:31.020 align:start position:0%
not the department is on its toes and
 
00:51:34.069 --> 00:51:34.079 align:start position:0%
actually doing its homework and you you
 
00:51:36.349 --> 00:51:36.359 align:start position:0%
never you never fail so thank you thank
 
00:51:39.349 --> 00:51:39.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:43.069 --> 00:51:43.079 align:start position:0%
entertain a motion to approve the item
 
00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:45.480 align:start position:0%
all right wait representative erf has a
 
00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:47.089 align:start position:0%
all right wait representative erf has a
question

00:51:47.089 --> 00:51:47.099 align:start position:0%
question
 
00:51:49.849 --> 00:51:49.859 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
00:51:51.650 --> 00:51:51.660 align:start position:0%
and thank you both
 
00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:53.400 align:start position:0%
I had some questions and you did answer
 
00:51:54.950 --> 00:51:54.960 align:start position:0%
them but I have another one that kind of
 
00:51:57.230 --> 00:51:57.240 align:start position:0%
ties into those questions
 
00:51:59.270 --> 00:51:59.280 align:start position:0%
um can you speak to the racial and
 
00:52:01.490 --> 00:52:01.500 align:start position:0%
ethnic Health disparities mentioned here
 
00:52:03.589 --> 00:52:03.599 align:start position:0%
occurring in our prisons and Rural
 
00:52:05.930 --> 00:52:05.940 align:start position:0%
locations sure so
 
00:52:07.490 --> 00:52:07.500 align:start position:0%
there are these funds which are funds
 
00:52:09.950 --> 00:52:09.960 align:start position:0%
that were accepted uh a while back now
 
00:52:12.410 --> 00:52:12.420 align:start position:0%
you know 18 months ago or so
 
00:52:14.150 --> 00:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
um was really designed for not only
 
00:52:16.370 --> 00:52:16.380 align:start position:0%
racial and ethnic Health disparities but
 
00:52:18.410 --> 00:52:18.420 align:start position:0%
Health disparities across the board and
 
00:52:20.390 --> 00:52:20.400 align:start position:0%
so incarcerated individuals are
 
00:52:22.430 --> 00:52:22.440 align:start position:0%
considered one of those people that have
 
00:52:25.370 --> 00:52:25.380 align:start position:0%
a disparate outcome and disparate impact
 
00:52:28.190 --> 00:52:28.200 align:start position:0%
of covid-19 so I don't know the racial
 
00:52:30.109 --> 00:52:30.119 align:start position:0%
ethnic breakup of the incarcerated
 
00:52:32.450 --> 00:52:32.460 align:start position:0%
population but just by the means that
 
00:52:34.190 --> 00:52:34.200 align:start position:0%
they are in that congregate setting
 
00:52:36.109 --> 00:52:36.119 align:start position:0%
where it's really hard to manage
 
00:52:38.390 --> 00:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
infectious diseases they are at higher
 
00:52:40.970 --> 00:52:40.980 align:start position:0%
risk for Contracting infectious diseases
 
00:52:43.490 --> 00:52:43.500 align:start position:0%
not only among the population of
 
00:52:44.990 --> 00:52:45.000 align:start position:0%
residents that are in those facilities
 
00:52:47.750 --> 00:52:47.760 align:start position:0%
but also among the staff we work very
 
00:52:50.750 --> 00:52:50.760 align:start position:0%
closely with our all of our Correctional
 
00:52:52.609 --> 00:52:52.619 align:start position:0%
Facilities County and the state systems
 
00:52:54.829 --> 00:52:54.839 align:start position:0%
to help them manage and mitigate those
 
00:52:56.809 --> 00:52:56.819 align:start position:0%
risks because it's very different than
 
00:52:59.390 --> 00:52:59.400 align:start position:0%
say a health care facility or you know
 
00:53:01.430 --> 00:53:01.440 align:start position:0%
any other facility where people have a
 
00:53:02.690 --> 00:53:02.700 align:start position:0%
little bit more ownership you could wear
 
00:53:05.329 --> 00:53:05.339 align:start position:0%
masks there's really some special need
 
00:53:07.730 --> 00:53:07.740 align:start position:0%
in these in in these places
 
00:53:10.849 --> 00:53:10.859 align:start position:0%
I follow up follow up
 
00:53:13.069 --> 00:53:13.079 align:start position:0%
thank you for that I might suggest that
 
00:53:14.569 --> 00:53:14.579 align:start position:0%
when you write these things up you're a
 
00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:15.720 align:start position:0%
little clear about what you write since
 
00:53:17.210 --> 00:53:17.220 align:start position:0%
it was pretty clear that you were
 
00:53:19.130 --> 00:53:19.140 align:start position:0%
talking about racial and ethnic Health
 
00:53:20.990 --> 00:53:21.000 align:start position:0%
disparities I didn't just pull that out
 
00:53:23.270 --> 00:53:23.280 align:start position:0%
of the air great but thank you no I
 
00:53:24.829 --> 00:53:24.839 align:start position:0%
appreciate that question and I'll just
 
00:53:27.589 --> 00:53:27.599 align:start position:0%
let the committee know just today the
 
00:53:29.150 --> 00:53:29.160 align:start position:0%
federal government accountability office
 
00:53:32.150 --> 00:53:32.160 align:start position:0%
the GAO submitted a report on this
 
00:53:34.190 --> 00:53:34.200 align:start position:0%
particular funding source where they did
 
00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
a deep dive in five States including New
 
00:53:38.930 --> 00:53:38.940 align:start position:0%
Hampshire about the types of work that
 
00:53:40.430 --> 00:53:40.440 align:start position:0%
is going on with them so I'm happy to
 
00:53:41.630 --> 00:53:41.640 align:start position:0%
share that if the committee is
 
00:53:41.640 --> 00:53:45.589 align:start position:0%
share that if the committee is
interested

00:53:45.589 --> 00:53:45.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:49.970 --> 00:53:49.980 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:51.950 --> 00:53:51.960 align:start position:0%
representative Earth moves to approve I
 
00:53:55.010 --> 00:53:55.020 align:start position:0%
think it was Senator Bradley or
 
00:53:57.410 --> 00:53:57.420 align:start position:0%
Senator gray moved to a second
 
00:53:59.450 --> 00:53:59.460 align:start position:0%
further discussion any more questions
 
00:54:01.790 --> 00:54:01.800 align:start position:0%
from the committee members seeing Nani
 
00:54:03.349 --> 00:54:03.359 align:start position:0%
ready for the question all in favor of
 
00:54:05.270 --> 00:54:05.280 align:start position:0%
adopting the Amendments adopting the
 
00:54:07.130 --> 00:54:07.140 align:start position:0%
items say aye
 
00:54:08.750 --> 00:54:08.760 align:start position:0%
opposed no
 
00:54:12.650 --> 00:54:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
next one I have is FIS 23030
 
00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:20.700 align:start position:0%
and it was request of Senator Rosenwald
 
00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:23.700 align:start position:0%
Department of Health and Human Services
 
00:54:26.089 --> 00:54:26.099 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
00:54:27.710 --> 00:54:27.720 align:start position:0%
chairman of several
 
00:54:30.410 --> 00:54:30.420 align:start position:0%
questions you may go ahead thank you so
 
00:54:34.309 --> 00:54:34.319 align:start position:0%
this item seems to
 
00:54:37.130 --> 00:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
start some new programs or expand some
 
00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:38.569 align:start position:0%
start some new programs or expand some
programs

00:54:38.569 --> 00:54:38.579 align:start position:0%
programs
 
00:54:43.010 --> 00:54:43.020 align:start position:0%
using federal funds
 
00:54:43.020 --> 00:54:43.730 align:start position:0%
using federal funds
um

00:54:43.730 --> 00:54:43.740 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:46.970 --> 00:54:46.980 align:start position:0%
like the homeless Health Care Program
 
00:54:51.290 --> 00:54:51.300 align:start position:0%
is the department planning to put years
 
00:54:55.430 --> 00:54:55.440 align:start position:0%
two and three into the budget
 
00:54:58.730 --> 00:54:58.740 align:start position:0%
after we accept this money for starting
 
00:55:02.870 --> 00:55:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:04.730 --> 00:55:04.740 align:start position:0%
or will
 
00:55:08.809 --> 00:55:08.819 align:start position:0%
I guess the rest of that question is at
 
00:55:12.410 --> 00:55:12.420 align:start position:0%
the end of arpa funds will we be
 
00:55:15.650 --> 00:55:15.660 align:start position:0%
expecting to see these as ongoing budget
 
00:55:15.660 --> 00:55:18.710 align:start position:0%
expecting to see these as ongoing budget
requests

00:55:18.710 --> 00:55:18.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:20.760 align:start position:0%
so I I will answer the first question
 
00:55:24.410 --> 00:55:24.420 align:start position:0%
again Nathan white DHHS CFO at this
 
00:55:26.750 --> 00:55:26.760 align:start position:0%
point in time based on the guidance that
 
00:55:29.390 --> 00:55:29.400 align:start position:0%
we received the Statewide guidance that
 
00:55:30.950 --> 00:55:30.960 align:start position:0%
we received back this back in this
 
00:55:33.349 --> 00:55:33.359 align:start position:0%
during the summer in August when we put
 
00:55:36.290 --> 00:55:36.300 align:start position:0%
our agency budget requests together we
 
00:55:38.150 --> 00:55:38.160 align:start position:0%
we had kept those
 
00:55:40.490 --> 00:55:40.500 align:start position:0%
um the the one-time Federal money the
 
00:55:43.370 --> 00:55:43.380 align:start position:0%
arpa funds and other funds outside of
 
00:55:44.809 --> 00:55:44.819 align:start position:0%
our standard agency budget request
 
00:55:46.490 --> 00:55:46.500 align:start position:0%
however you know if at the legislative
 
00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:49.140 align:start position:0%
phase or whatever brings about through
 
00:55:51.710 --> 00:55:51.720 align:start position:0%
the governor's budget there was a desire
 
00:55:53.750 --> 00:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
to include that in in the the
 
00:55:55.609 --> 00:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
overarching budget we will certainly do
 
00:55:55.619 --> 00:55:56.870 align:start position:0%
overarching budget we will certainly do
so

00:55:56.870 --> 00:55:56.880 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:55:59.690 --> 00:55:59.700 align:start position:0%
um as far as the long term
 
00:56:01.370 --> 00:56:01.380 align:start position:0%
um I mean ultimately that would be
 
00:56:02.870 --> 00:56:02.880 align:start position:0%
dependent upon whether funds would be
 
00:56:04.730 --> 00:56:04.740 align:start position:0%
available to continue these these
 
00:56:04.740 --> 00:56:08.510 align:start position:0%
available to continue these these
programs

00:56:08.510 --> 00:56:08.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:10.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:56:11.630 --> 00:56:11.640 align:start position:0%
um so
 
00:56:15.130 --> 00:56:15.140 align:start position:0%
the 30 million dollars in Workforce
 
00:56:19.970 --> 00:56:19.980 align:start position:0%
Investments I see that's a one-time
 
00:56:23.990 --> 00:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
retention bonuses or
 
00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:28.800 align:start position:0%
um something like that is the department
 
00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:32.700 align:start position:0%
going to include other Workforce
 
00:56:36.049 --> 00:56:36.059 align:start position:0%
Investments like Medicaid rate increases
 
00:56:42.190 --> 00:56:42.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:44.510 --> 00:56:44.520 align:start position:0%
are we going to include Medicaid budget
 
00:56:46.849 --> 00:56:46.859 align:start position:0%
rate increases in our budget request is
 
00:56:49.549 --> 00:56:49.559 align:start position:0%
it uh yes so in our agency budget
 
00:56:51.230 --> 00:56:51.240 align:start position:0%
request you'll see our efficiency budget
 
00:56:53.150 --> 00:56:53.160 align:start position:0%
as well as our prioritized needs column
 
00:56:55.329 --> 00:56:55.339 align:start position:0%
and we included a number of
 
00:56:58.549 --> 00:56:58.559 align:start position:0%
Medicaid rate increases off the top of
 
00:57:00.109 --> 00:57:00.119 align:start position:0%
my head I believe we had 20 million
 
00:57:03.109 --> 00:57:03.119 align:start position:0%
dollars for General Medicaid uh in the
 
00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:08.220 align:start position:0%
LTT LD dltss we had included an
 
00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:10.500 align:start position:0%
additional budget rate increase we had
 
00:57:12.609 --> 00:57:12.619 align:start position:0%
included an additional prioritized need
 
00:57:16.490 --> 00:57:16.500 align:start position:0%
request to align the adult Dental fee
 
00:57:17.870 --> 00:57:17.880 align:start position:0%
schedule with the children's fee
 
00:57:19.910 --> 00:57:19.920 align:start position:0%
schedule as well so there are a number
 
00:57:19.920 --> 00:57:20.770 align:start position:0%
schedule as well so there are a number
of

00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:20.780 align:start position:0%
of
 
00:57:22.730 --> 00:57:22.740 align:start position:0%
prioritized needs requests that we did
 
00:57:24.890 --> 00:57:24.900 align:start position:0%
include in our budget when we submitted
 
00:57:28.250 --> 00:57:28.260 align:start position:0%
that back in September thank you and one
 
00:57:31.190 --> 00:57:31.200 align:start position:0%
more if I could I see that
 
00:57:34.010 --> 00:57:34.020 align:start position:0%
um you want to fund presumptive
 
00:57:36.950 --> 00:57:36.960 align:start position:0%
eligibility for CFI
 
00:57:40.690 --> 00:57:40.700 align:start position:0%
with two million dollars we've we've had
 
00:57:44.270 --> 00:57:44.280 align:start position:0%
presumptive eligibility for CFI on the
 
00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.410 align:start position:0%
presumptive eligibility for CFI on the
books

00:57:45.410 --> 00:57:45.420 align:start position:0%
books
 
00:57:48.890 --> 00:57:48.900 align:start position:0%
for 15 years in New Hampshire we've
 
00:57:53.470 --> 00:57:53.480 align:start position:0%
never funded it my understanding is
 
00:57:57.410 --> 00:57:57.420 align:start position:0%
there's no guarantee of a retroactive
 
00:58:01.250 --> 00:58:01.260 align:start position:0%
payment and that state general funds
 
00:58:03.650 --> 00:58:03.660 align:start position:0%
would be on the hook
 
00:58:07.910 --> 00:58:07.920 align:start position:0%
if the person was later found ineligible
 
00:58:10.849 --> 00:58:10.859 align:start position:0%
I'm assuming that's still true but for
 
00:58:14.210 --> 00:58:14.220 align:start position:0%
15 years we haven't funded it in fact
 
00:58:17.690 --> 00:58:17.700 align:start position:0%
when the governor presented his budget
 
00:58:21.190 --> 00:58:21.200 align:start position:0%
to the legislature two years ago
 
00:58:25.010 --> 00:58:25.020 align:start position:0%
he asked to repeal this program in house
 
00:58:29.089 --> 00:58:29.099 align:start position:0%
bill 2. we worked in the Senate phase to
 
00:58:32.390 --> 00:58:32.400 align:start position:0%
suspend it why that why the change of
 
00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:33.829 align:start position:0%
suspend it why that why the change of
heart

00:58:33.829 --> 00:58:33.839 align:start position:0%
heart
 
00:58:38.630 --> 00:58:38.640 align:start position:0%
after 15 years why has the department
 
00:58:41.270 --> 00:58:41.280 align:start position:0%
come on board sure hi my name is Melissa
 
00:58:43.130 --> 00:58:43.140 align:start position:0%
Hardy I'm the division director for
 
00:58:45.289 --> 00:58:45.299 align:start position:0%
long-term supports and services thank
 
00:58:48.530 --> 00:58:48.540 align:start position:0%
you for your question in our most recent
 
00:58:50.930 --> 00:58:50.940 align:start position:0%
submission to CMS for the arpa spending
 
00:58:52.910 --> 00:58:52.920 align:start position:0%
plan we've actually changed from
 
00:58:55.809 --> 00:58:55.819 align:start position:0%
presumptive eligibility to Diversion
 
00:58:58.670 --> 00:58:58.680 align:start position:0%
knowing those facts that you just stated
 
00:59:02.210 --> 00:59:02.220 align:start position:0%
and also as far as needing a one one
 
00:59:04.789 --> 00:59:04.799 align:start position:0%
five waiver in order to do presumptive
 
00:59:07.789 --> 00:59:07.799 align:start position:0%
eligibility so I think there was a link
 
00:59:10.849 --> 00:59:10.859 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal item to our most recent
 
00:59:13.370 --> 00:59:13.380 align:start position:0%
updated spending plan that's been
 
00:59:17.150 --> 00:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
approved by CMS to actually change from
 
00:59:19.250 --> 00:59:19.260 align:start position:0%
presumptive eligibility to Diversion
 
00:59:21.250 --> 00:59:21.260 align:start position:0%
meaning providing
 
00:59:23.569 --> 00:59:23.579 align:start position:0%
community-based supports to non-medicaid
 
00:59:26.930 --> 00:59:26.940 align:start position:0%
folks such as home health aides Meals on
 
00:59:28.490 --> 00:59:28.500 align:start position:0%
Wheels in order to keep them in the
 
00:59:29.690 --> 00:59:29.700 align:start position:0%
community longer versus
 
00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:33.530 align:start position:0%
community longer versus
institutionalization

00:59:33.530 --> 00:59:33.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:38.270 --> 00:59:38.280 align:start position:0%
final follow-up so on page
 
00:59:40.549 --> 00:59:40.559 align:start position:0%
I don't know
 
00:59:41.930 --> 00:59:41.940 align:start position:0%
um where you
 
00:59:44.870 --> 00:59:44.880 align:start position:0%
request two million dollars for
 
00:59:48.950 --> 00:59:48.960 align:start position:0%
presumptive eligibility is that in
 
00:59:52.549 --> 00:59:52.559 align:start position:0%
you're not requesting that correct we we
 
00:59:55.490 --> 00:59:55.500 align:start position:0%
have changed our um approach with these
 
00:59:58.309 --> 00:59:58.319 align:start position:0%
dollars and is now changing it to
 
01:00:00.589 --> 01:00:00.599 align:start position:0%
um the diversion process so presumptive
 
01:00:02.990 --> 01:00:03.000 align:start position:0%
eligibility is not in our spending plan
 
01:00:06.650 --> 01:00:06.660 align:start position:0%
okay and and just as a point of clarity
 
01:00:09.109 --> 01:00:09.119 align:start position:0%
um the the prior item is included in
 
01:00:11.450 --> 01:00:11.460 align:start position:0%
this and when we submit the new item we
 
01:00:13.250 --> 01:00:13.260 align:start position:0%
attach all the documentation that was
 
01:00:15.410 --> 01:00:15.420 align:start position:0%
included in the prior item we we tried
 
01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:17.040 align:start position:0%
to correct for that by including that
 
01:00:19.370 --> 01:00:19.380 align:start position:0%
link that Melissa had referenced there
 
01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:21.480 align:start position:0%
but that's that's why you're seeing that
 
01:00:22.970 --> 01:00:22.980 align:start position:0%
old language attached to the full
 
01:00:25.069 --> 01:00:25.079 align:start position:0%
complete item there in front of you
 
01:00:26.870 --> 01:00:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:29.630 --> 01:00:29.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.150 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
if

01:00:32.150 --> 01:00:32.160 align:start position:0%
if
 
01:00:34.370 --> 01:00:34.380 align:start position:0%
the item when you submit it is a little
 
01:00:36.609 --> 01:00:36.619 align:start position:0%
clearer we won't need as many questions
 
01:00:40.130 --> 01:00:40.140 align:start position:0%
so obviously she found something that
 
01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:42.480 align:start position:0%
wasn't clearly spelled out that should
 
01:00:44.990 --> 01:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
have been done so we didn't need to
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:50.210 --> 01:00:50.220 align:start position:0%
and and ask all these questions because
 
01:00:52.250 --> 01:00:52.260 align:start position:0%
it obviously wasn't explained in the
 
01:00:52.260 --> 01:00:53.870 align:start position:0%
it obviously wasn't explained in the
item

01:00:53.870 --> 01:00:53.880 align:start position:0%
item
 
01:00:56.450 --> 01:00:56.460 align:start position:0%
we're hoping for better communication in
 
01:00:59.150 --> 01:00:59.160 align:start position:0%
the future any motion to approve the
 
01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:01.370 align:start position:0%
the future any motion to approve the

01:01:14.809 --> 01:01:14.819 align:start position:0%
question all in favor say aye
 
01:01:19.549 --> 01:01:19.559 align:start position:0%

01:01:35.210 --> 01:01:35.220 align:start position:0%
any discussion on this I think I see
 
01:01:38.270 --> 01:01:38.280 align:start position:0%
some questions both from the Senate and
 
01:01:40.490 --> 01:01:40.500 align:start position:0%
from representative erf I think you are
 
01:01:42.829 --> 01:01:42.839 align:start position:0%
no you had no questions on this one all
 
01:01:46.309 --> 01:01:46.319 align:start position:0%
right any Senator any Senator had a
 
01:01:48.530 --> 01:01:48.540 align:start position:0%
question there was some indication from
 
01:01:50.990 --> 01:01:51.000 align:start position:0%
the LBA that the senate had some
 
01:01:53.690 --> 01:01:53.700 align:start position:0%
question on this
 
01:01:55.849 --> 01:01:55.859 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald is recognized I think
 
01:01:59.630 --> 01:01:59.640 align:start position:0%
I had a couple of questions on page
 
01:02:06.049 --> 01:02:06.059 align:start position:0%
four in the ABD grants aptd grants the
 
01:02:10.630 --> 01:02:10.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:14.990 --> 01:02:15.000 align:start position:0%
are not back to pre-covered levels and
 
01:02:19.549 --> 01:02:19.559 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:21.349 --> 01:02:21.359 align:start position:0%
we're having trouble getting
 
01:02:21.359 --> 01:02:24.289 align:start position:0%
we're having trouble getting
determinations

01:02:24.289 --> 01:02:24.299 align:start position:0%
determinations
 
01:02:28.030 --> 01:02:28.040 align:start position:0%
made or because
 
01:02:33.109 --> 01:02:33.119 align:start position:0%
you can't we can't find the direct
 
01:02:35.390 --> 01:02:35.400 align:start position:0%
service providers
 
01:02:38.630 --> 01:02:38.640 align:start position:0%
to provide this service once the
 
01:02:41.809 --> 01:02:41.819 align:start position:0%
determinations are made how why are
 
01:02:41.819 --> 01:02:42.970 align:start position:0%
determinations are made how why are
those

01:02:42.970 --> 01:02:42.980 align:start position:0%
those
 
01:02:49.190 --> 01:02:49.200 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:54.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
the decrease
 
01:02:59.270 --> 01:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
kind of have Chris sentinelo joined me
 
01:03:01.870 --> 01:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
to answer that question
 
01:03:04.789 --> 01:03:04.799 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Chris Antonello associate
 
01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:06.359 align:start position:0%
commissioner can you repeat the question
 
01:03:10.329 --> 01:03:10.339 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry so the APD
 
01:03:13.190 --> 01:03:13.200 align:start position:0%
caseloads are not back to pre-covered
 
01:03:14.809 --> 01:03:14.819 align:start position:0%
levels yeah
 
01:03:18.170 --> 01:03:18.180 align:start position:0%
to what extent is that because we can't
 
01:03:21.950 --> 01:03:21.960 align:start position:0%
get the determinations done
 
01:03:24.770 --> 01:03:24.780 align:start position:0%
and to what extent is it because once
 
01:03:26.510 --> 01:03:26.520 align:start position:0%
the determinations are done there
 
01:03:30.349 --> 01:03:30.359 align:start position:0%
there's a lack of care providers to
 
01:03:33.530 --> 01:03:33.540 align:start position:0%
deliver the services well aptd is a cash
 
01:03:35.870 --> 01:03:35.880 align:start position:0%
payment so it wouldn't be reliant on
 
01:03:38.750 --> 01:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
care providers but I can go back and
 
01:03:41.569 --> 01:03:41.579 align:start position:0%
look at our most recent statistics
 
01:03:43.970 --> 01:03:43.980 align:start position:0%
because we do track how many people are
 
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
pending I just don't have that with me
 
01:03:48.890 --> 01:03:48.900 align:start position:0%
okay could I but I will get that to you
 
01:03:51.589 --> 01:03:51.599 align:start position:0%
so on page
 
01:03:51.599 --> 01:03:53.630 align:start position:0%
so on page
12.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:53.640 align:start position:0%
12.
 
01:03:53.640 --> 01:03:54.349 align:start position:0%
12.
um

01:03:54.349 --> 01:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:00.650 --> 01:04:00.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:00.660 --> 01:04:03.770 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:03.770 --> 01:04:03.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.450 --> 01:04:08.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:10.789 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:04:10.789 --> 01:04:10.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:13.910 --> 01:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
we've had delays in residential
 
01:04:16.789 --> 01:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
treatment contract approvals
 
01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
and have not been able to stand up the
 
01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:22.140 align:start position:0%
programs we've funded
 
01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:23.390 align:start position:0%
programs we've funded
sure

01:04:23.390 --> 01:04:23.400 align:start position:0%
sure
 
01:04:26.450 --> 01:04:26.460 align:start position:0%
um I mean Katya Fox is going to join me
 
01:04:28.730 --> 01:04:28.740 align:start position:0%
here I I believe kacho will probably
 
01:04:31.849 --> 01:04:31.859 align:start position:0%
speak to General capacity issues but go
 
01:04:36.349 --> 01:04:36.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:39.589 --> 01:04:39.599 align:start position:0%
so good afternoon I'm Katya Fox I'm the
 
01:04:41.569 --> 01:04:41.579 align:start position:0%
director of the division for Behavioral
 
01:04:45.549 --> 01:04:45.559 align:start position:0%
Health and the you're going to see
 
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
repeatedly that we do have delays where
 
01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:51.599 align:start position:0%
appropriated funds that start July 1st
 
01:04:53.030 --> 01:04:53.040 align:start position:0%
well of course we have to go through
 
01:04:55.789 --> 01:04:55.799 align:start position:0%
quite a process to get those funds
 
01:04:59.630 --> 01:04:59.640 align:start position:0%
approved and that includes contracts and
 
01:05:02.030 --> 01:05:02.040 align:start position:0%
we have contracts currently for
 
01:05:04.430 --> 01:05:04.440 align:start position:0%
children's residential treatment I
 
01:05:08.150 --> 01:05:08.160 align:start position:0%
believe we have 46 programs and so we're
 
01:05:12.710 --> 01:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
Contracting extensively and therefore by
 
01:05:16.010 --> 01:05:16.020 align:start position:0%
the time we we get those into place time
 
01:05:18.829 --> 01:05:18.839 align:start position:0%
has passed and so not as many funds are
 
01:05:23.270 --> 01:05:23.280 align:start position:0%
needed or used also you also will note
 
01:05:27.049 --> 01:05:27.059 align:start position:0%
that Staffing capacity is a huge issue
 
01:05:31.130 --> 01:05:31.140 align:start position:0%
so the use of the any housing and
 
01:05:34.210 --> 01:05:34.220 align:start position:0%
treatment specifically for treatment
 
01:05:37.730 --> 01:05:37.740 align:start position:0%
the capacity is not the full amount that
 
01:05:40.990 --> 01:05:41.000 align:start position:0%
we contract for so therefore
 
01:05:47.390 --> 01:05:47.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:50.809 --> 01:05:50.819 align:start position:0%
thank you further questions yes on same
 
01:05:53.470 --> 01:05:53.480 align:start position:0%
page that community mental health
 
01:05:57.470 --> 01:05:57.480 align:start position:0%
programs support there's uh the
 
01:05:57.480 --> 01:05:59.089 align:start position:0%
programs support there's uh the
contracts

01:05:59.089 --> 01:05:59.099 align:start position:0%
contracts
 
01:06:02.870 --> 01:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
contract obligations have been less than
 
01:06:06.770 --> 01:06:06.780 align:start position:0%
anticipated due to delay of supported
 
01:06:11.589 --> 01:06:11.599 align:start position:0%
housing expansion where do we stand on
 
01:06:11.599 --> 01:06:13.130 align:start position:0%
housing expansion where do we stand on
Contracting

01:06:13.130 --> 01:06:13.140 align:start position:0%
Contracting
 
01:06:17.270 --> 01:06:17.280 align:start position:0%
the second tranche of the supported
 
01:06:21.230 --> 01:06:21.240 align:start position:0%
housing beds that we've funded three or
 
01:06:22.970 --> 01:06:22.980 align:start position:0%
four years ago
 
01:06:26.809 --> 01:06:26.819 align:start position:0%
so again thank you for that question I
 
01:06:29.150 --> 01:06:29.160 align:start position:0%
do want to note that yes we we are
 
01:06:32.170 --> 01:06:32.180 align:start position:0%
transferring funds from this area
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
and because of the lack of our ability
 
01:06:39.289 --> 01:06:39.299 align:start position:0%
to stand up some beds but we have in
 
01:06:41.150 --> 01:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
that in the meantime between State
 
01:06:44.390 --> 01:06:44.400 align:start position:0%
fiscal year 21 and 22 we still were able
 
01:06:47.329 --> 01:06:47.339 align:start position:0%
to stand up 52 Beds which is pretty
 
01:06:50.089 --> 01:06:50.099 align:start position:0%
significant considering the challenges
 
01:06:54.010 --> 01:06:54.020 align:start position:0%
in the housing market and with Staffing
 
01:06:57.410 --> 01:06:57.420 align:start position:0%
so I can get you the breakdown of where
 
01:06:59.569 --> 01:06:59.579 align:start position:0%
that growth has come and what types of
 
01:07:02.150 --> 01:07:02.160 align:start position:0%
beds because a bed is not a bed we have
 
01:07:06.349 --> 01:07:06.359 align:start position:0%
transitional housing we have drf beds we
 
01:07:06.359 --> 01:07:08.170 align:start position:0%
transitional housing we have drf beds we
have

01:07:08.170 --> 01:07:08.180 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:07:10.490 --> 01:07:10.500 align:start position:0%
permanent Supportive Housing so there
 
01:07:12.109 --> 01:07:12.119 align:start position:0%
are a number of different areas and it's
 
01:07:16.069 --> 01:07:16.079 align:start position:0%
just not you know beds so so I can get
 
01:07:19.609 --> 01:07:19.619 align:start position:0%
you the breakdown of that but that is a
 
01:07:22.250 --> 01:07:22.260 align:start position:0%
reality is again the delays in
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
Contracting and providers ability to be
 
01:07:27.650 --> 01:07:27.660 align:start position:0%
able to stand up these funds we have a
 
01:07:30.109 --> 01:07:30.119 align:start position:0%
really as you know are really tight
 
01:07:32.089 --> 01:07:32.099 align:start position:0%
housing market and in order for them to
 
01:07:33.890 --> 01:07:33.900 align:start position:0%
stand up they have to have housing stock
 
01:07:37.630 --> 01:07:37.640 align:start position:0%
and the ability to to have that property
 
01:07:41.569 --> 01:07:41.579 align:start position:0%
as well is we have a our housing Bridge
 
01:07:45.770 --> 01:07:45.780 align:start position:0%
subsidy program which is provides a
 
01:07:48.170 --> 01:07:48.180 align:start position:0%
bridge until someone can get on to a
 
01:07:51.730 --> 01:07:51.740 align:start position:0%
Housing Voucher housing Choice voucher
 
01:07:55.130 --> 01:07:55.140 align:start position:0%
and what has happened is that even
 
01:07:56.870 --> 01:07:56.880 align:start position:0%
though we have a number of people who've
 
01:07:59.630 --> 01:07:59.640 align:start position:0%
been approved for those vouchers and for
 
01:08:02.390 --> 01:08:02.400 align:start position:0%
that bridge they have been unable to
 
01:08:05.390 --> 01:08:05.400 align:start position:0%
secure housing so we have about 25
 
01:08:07.370 --> 01:08:07.380 align:start position:0%
percent of the people who have been
 
01:08:11.270 --> 01:08:11.280 align:start position:0%
approved are still out seeking an
 
01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:12.470 align:start position:0%
approved are still out seeking an
apartment

01:08:12.470 --> 01:08:12.480 align:start position:0%
apartment
 
01:08:16.130 --> 01:08:16.140 align:start position:0%
final follow-up if I could
 
01:08:18.829 --> 01:08:18.839 align:start position:0%
um thank you for mentioning drf bets
 
01:08:22.490 --> 01:08:22.500 align:start position:0%
because I know that in the last year the
 
01:08:25.669 --> 01:08:25.679 align:start position:0%
fiscal committee approved some money to
 
01:08:29.150 --> 01:08:29.160 align:start position:0%
add to our stock of drf beds how many
 
01:08:34.370 --> 01:08:34.380 align:start position:0%
new drf beds have we contracted for with
 
01:08:36.709 --> 01:08:36.719 align:start position:0%
the money we approved
 
01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:38.699 align:start position:0%
so I would need to know what time frame
 
01:08:40.070 --> 01:08:40.080 align:start position:0%
you're looking at and then I can get
 
01:08:42.470 --> 01:08:42.480 align:start position:0%
back to you with the money we approved
 
01:08:45.050 --> 01:08:45.060 align:start position:0%
last year I'll have to get back to you
 
01:08:47.689 --> 01:08:47.699 align:start position:0%
on on that um as you know again uh
 
01:08:49.849 --> 01:08:49.859 align:start position:0%
Workforce has been a huge challenge in
 
01:08:52.249 --> 01:08:52.259 align:start position:0%
being able to staff our beds thank you
 
01:08:55.789 --> 01:08:55.799 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:57.650 --> 01:08:57.660 align:start position:0%

01:10:46.970 --> 01:10:46.980 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:48.840 align:start position:0%
we're very very related
 
01:10:52.130 --> 01:10:52.140 align:start position:0%
could you give me date certain when
 
01:10:52.140 --> 01:10:53.890 align:start position:0%
could you give me date certain when
online

01:10:53.890 --> 01:10:53.900 align:start position:0%
online
 
01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:57.540 align:start position:0%
renewals will be complete and also when
 
01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
online new registrations will be
 
01:11:00.480 --> 01:11:01.669 align:start position:0%
online new registrations will be
complete

01:11:01.669 --> 01:11:01.679 align:start position:0%
complete
 
01:11:04.250 --> 01:11:04.260 align:start position:0%
I believe that's in the next item oh my
 
01:11:12.229 --> 01:11:12.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:14.030 --> 01:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
I spelled out the next police so you're
 
01:11:16.790 --> 01:11:16.800 align:start position:0%
you're referencing our uh ohrv online
 
01:11:20.030 --> 01:11:20.040 align:start position:0%
registration request my bad
 
01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:23.340 align:start position:0%
sure okay so we're at we're at item
 
01:11:26.689 --> 01:11:26.699 align:start position:0%
number 23014 we have a motion to accept
 
01:11:29.930 --> 01:11:29.940 align:start position:0%
in a second further discussion seeing
 
01:11:33.890 --> 01:11:33.900 align:start position:0%
none all in favor say aye pose no
 
01:11:35.770 --> 01:11:35.780 align:start position:0%
item FIS
 
01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:40.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:47.630 --> 01:11:47.640 align:start position:0%
13 item 23015 and we have the right
 
01:11:49.250 --> 01:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
people here I think
 
01:11:49.260 --> 01:11:51.770 align:start position:0%
people here I think
director

01:11:51.770 --> 01:11:51.780 align:start position:0%
director
 
01:12:07.610 --> 01:12:07.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.169 --> 01:12:09.179 align:start position:0%
there was a question both from
 
01:12:12.350 --> 01:12:12.360 align:start position:0%
representative erf and as in a senator
 
01:12:15.590 --> 01:12:15.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:18.410 --> 01:12:18.420 align:start position:0%
representative erf question
 
01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:21.719 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and Senator Bradley I
 
01:12:23.149 --> 01:12:23.159 align:start position:0%
think you heard my questions and they
 
01:12:25.430 --> 01:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
haven't changed the date certain for
 
01:12:27.430 --> 01:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
implementation of
 
01:12:29.689 --> 01:12:29.699 align:start position:0%
renewal registrations and then
 
01:12:31.669 --> 01:12:31.679 align:start position:0%
apparently separately for new
 
01:12:31.679 --> 01:12:33.709 align:start position:0%
apparently separately for new
registrations

01:12:33.709 --> 01:12:33.719 align:start position:0%
registrations
 
01:12:33.719 --> 01:12:34.669 align:start position:0%
registrations
um

01:12:34.669 --> 01:12:34.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:37.610 --> 01:12:37.620 align:start position:0%
what we originally negotiated with the
 
01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:40.260 align:start position:0%
snow machine in the ATV State
 
01:12:43.130 --> 01:12:43.140 align:start position:0%
organizations in the legislature was to
 
01:12:46.189 --> 01:12:46.199 align:start position:0%
have online renewals up and running by
 
01:12:48.709 --> 01:12:48.719 align:start position:0%
September of 25 once we have that
 
01:12:50.090 --> 01:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
program up and running and working
 
01:12:53.570 --> 01:12:53.580 align:start position:0%
successfully we will then add new
 
01:12:56.570 --> 01:12:56.580 align:start position:0%
registrations to that
 
01:12:56.580 --> 01:12:57.950 align:start position:0%
registrations to that
follow-up

01:12:57.950 --> 01:12:57.960 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:12:57.960 --> 01:12:59.990 align:start position:0%
follow-up
follow-up

01:12:59.990 --> 01:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:13:03.290 --> 01:13:03.300 align:start position:0%
so this is based on a bill and maybe I
 
01:13:04.490 --> 01:13:04.500 align:start position:0%
misread it and I think you actually
 
01:13:07.010 --> 01:13:07.020 align:start position:0%
quoted it in your fiscal note I thought
 
01:13:08.270 --> 01:13:08.280 align:start position:0%
everything was supposed to be done by
 
01:13:11.510 --> 01:13:11.520 align:start position:0%
September of 25.
 
01:13:13.669 --> 01:13:13.679 align:start position:0%
um it's our interpretation that what we
 
01:13:18.169 --> 01:13:18.179 align:start position:0%
agreed to was uh uh renewals by 25 and
 
01:13:20.930 --> 01:13:20.940 align:start position:0%
then new registrations immediately
 
01:13:20.940 --> 01:13:22.510 align:start position:0%
then new registrations immediately
afterwards

01:13:22.510 --> 01:13:22.520 align:start position:0%
afterwards
 
01:13:26.209 --> 01:13:26.219 align:start position:0%
there was a question that was brought to
 
01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:28.560 align:start position:0%
Captain Eastman asking if we could
 
01:13:30.709 --> 01:13:30.719 align:start position:0%
change the language in the bill so that
 
01:13:32.510 --> 01:13:32.520 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't have to come back after we
 
01:13:34.790 --> 01:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
did renewals for a separate bill and we
 
01:13:37.490 --> 01:13:37.500 align:start position:0%
agreed to that and unfortunately it's
 
01:13:40.189 --> 01:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
created some ambiguity into when we were
 
01:13:41.890 --> 01:13:41.900 align:start position:0%
going to develop
 
01:13:48.130 --> 01:13:48.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:50.510 --> 01:13:50.520 align:start position:0%
so one last question when you say
 
01:13:52.130 --> 01:13:52.140 align:start position:0%
immediate the new will be available
 
01:13:54.770 --> 01:13:54.780 align:start position:0%
immediately after as soon as we can you
 
01:13:57.110 --> 01:13:57.120 align:start position:0%
know we have to develop the system and
 
01:13:59.270 --> 01:13:59.280 align:start position:0%
and get it up and running so can you
 
01:14:00.770 --> 01:14:00.780 align:start position:0%
quantify that in terms of time months
 
01:14:02.149 --> 01:14:02.159 align:start position:0%
weeks years
 
01:14:02.159 --> 01:14:03.169 align:start position:0%
weeks years
um

01:14:03.169 --> 01:14:03.179 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:14:04.910 --> 01:14:04.920 align:start position:0%
I can't just because this will be the
 
01:14:06.890 --> 01:14:06.900 align:start position:0%
first time uh I've been part of the
 
01:14:08.870 --> 01:14:08.880 align:start position:0%
development of a system
 
01:14:11.270 --> 01:14:11.280 align:start position:0%
um the online
 
01:14:13.130 --> 01:14:13.140 align:start position:0%
um license sales for hunting and fishing
 
01:14:14.990 --> 01:14:15.000 align:start position:0%
licenses took several years to develop
 
01:14:16.970 --> 01:14:16.980 align:start position:0%
the whole program and get it up and
 
01:14:19.430 --> 01:14:19.440 align:start position:0%
running and and going
 
01:14:21.229 --> 01:14:21.239 align:start position:0%
um hopefully we'll be moving faster I
 
01:14:23.870 --> 01:14:23.880 align:start position:0%
think the industry has certainly gone to
 
01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:25.340 align:start position:0%
more online
 
01:14:28.070 --> 01:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
venues and I'm hoping that our Service
 
01:14:30.110 --> 01:14:30.120 align:start position:0%
Partners will be able to help us move
 
01:14:33.950 --> 01:14:33.960 align:start position:0%
forward more quickly part of the issue
 
01:14:36.110 --> 01:14:36.120 align:start position:0%
is is that we are revamping a lot of our
 
01:14:38.750 --> 01:14:38.760 align:start position:0%
computer systems at Fish and Game Online
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
registrations is just one of them the
 
01:14:44.270 --> 01:14:44.280 align:start position:0%
legislature has created a other
 
01:14:46.310 --> 01:14:46.320 align:start position:0%
requirement for us to have online deer
 
01:14:50.930 --> 01:14:50.940 align:start position:0%
registration in 24. online ATV
 
01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:53.120 align:start position:0%
registration in
 
01:14:57.590 --> 01:14:57.600 align:start position:0%
25. we have picked up there was a bill
 
01:15:01.790 --> 01:15:01.800 align:start position:0%
passed um 10 or 12 years ago that
 
01:15:04.630 --> 01:15:04.640 align:start position:0%
created it's part of a interstate
 
01:15:07.310 --> 01:15:07.320 align:start position:0%
compact that we that the state of New
 
01:15:10.850 --> 01:15:10.860 align:start position:0%
Hampshire joined uh so when you violate
 
01:15:13.490 --> 01:15:13.500 align:start position:0%
a hunting a fishing license you will not
 
01:15:15.470 --> 01:15:15.480 align:start position:0%
be able to buy a license in any of the
 
01:15:17.930 --> 01:15:17.940 align:start position:0%
participating States this is something
 
01:15:19.189 --> 01:15:19.199 align:start position:0%
that would that the state of New
 
01:15:21.830 --> 01:15:21.840 align:start position:0%
Hampshire agreed to tend to is either 10
 
01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:24.480 align:start position:0%
or 12 years ago so that program we're
 
01:15:26.149 --> 01:15:26.159 align:start position:0%
trying to get up and running for us too
 
01:15:29.630 --> 01:15:29.640 align:start position:0%
and at the same time we've that came
 
01:15:32.390 --> 01:15:32.400 align:start position:0%
through here last session we've received
 
01:15:35.270 --> 01:15:35.280 align:start position:0%
a go for Grant to upgrade our database
 
01:15:37.850 --> 01:15:37.860 align:start position:0%
systems so in the next couple of years
 
01:15:39.649 --> 01:15:39.659 align:start position:0%
we're going to have most of our folks
 
01:15:41.390 --> 01:15:41.400 align:start position:0%
involved in doing a bunch of different
 
01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:46.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:48.830 --> 01:15:48.840 align:start position:0%
Senator gray or Senator Bradley has a
 
01:15:52.490 --> 01:15:52.500 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:54.410 --> 01:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
um I think representative very fast most
 
01:15:56.450 --> 01:15:56.460 align:start position:0%
of my questions but I I guess I'd follow
 
01:15:59.390 --> 01:15:59.400 align:start position:0%
up on a why is it taking so long as I
 
01:16:01.850 --> 01:16:01.860 align:start position:0%
recall when we did the voluntary hike
 
01:16:04.550 --> 01:16:04.560 align:start position:0%
Safeguard which you administer and do a
 
01:16:06.830 --> 01:16:06.840 align:start position:0%
really good job of it
 
01:16:09.830 --> 01:16:09.840 align:start position:0%
um happened a lot sooner and quicker and
 
01:16:12.410 --> 01:16:12.420 align:start position:0%
it's very easy yeah the hike safe crowd
 
01:16:13.729 --> 01:16:13.739 align:start position:0%
we think I believe that was a much
 
01:16:15.310 --> 01:16:15.320 align:start position:0%
easier program to get up and running
 
01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:18.120 align:start position:0%
part of the problem here
 
01:16:20.750 --> 01:16:20.760 align:start position:0%
right now when you come to register a
 
01:16:20.760 --> 01:16:22.189 align:start position:0%
right now when you come to register a
machine

01:16:22.189 --> 01:16:22.199 align:start position:0%
machine
 
01:16:24.770 --> 01:16:24.780 align:start position:0%
um you the process obviously you show up
 
01:16:26.750 --> 01:16:26.760 align:start position:0%
physically at a location whether it be
 
01:16:29.510 --> 01:16:29.520 align:start position:0%
headquarters or one of our agents pay
 
01:16:32.149 --> 01:16:32.159 align:start position:0%
your money register your machine you
 
01:16:35.330 --> 01:16:35.340 align:start position:0%
receive the registration sticker so we
 
01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:37.199 align:start position:0%
have to set all of that that programming
 
01:16:38.470 --> 01:16:38.480 align:start position:0%
up to
 
01:16:41.390 --> 01:16:41.400 align:start position:0%
and it will be going through rule making
 
01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:43.440 align:start position:0%
there'll be quite a few steps for us to
 
01:16:48.169 --> 01:16:48.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:16:50.810 --> 01:16:50.820 align:start position:0%
Senator gray for a question uh actually
 
01:16:53.870 --> 01:16:53.880 align:start position:0%
more of a statement I've got several
 
01:16:56.390 --> 01:16:56.400 align:start position:0%
constituents along with several Senators
 
01:16:59.090 --> 01:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
that are very interested in this so when
 
01:17:01.910 --> 01:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
you come before Finance in the Senate I
 
01:17:04.250 --> 01:17:04.260 align:start position:0%
would hope that you'll bring along an
 
01:17:06.290 --> 01:17:06.300 align:start position:0%
update on this and how that relates to
 
01:17:08.870 --> 01:17:08.880 align:start position:0%
your budget items so we appreciate that
 
01:17:13.370 --> 01:17:13.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:15.709 --> 01:17:15.719 align:start position:0%
representative Edwards for a question uh
 
01:17:18.169 --> 01:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
thank you uh thank you uh Mr chairman
 
01:17:20.630 --> 01:17:20.640 align:start position:0%
thank you director Mason
 
01:17:23.450 --> 01:17:23.460 align:start position:0%
um my my good friend and colleague uh
 
01:17:26.570 --> 01:17:26.580 align:start position:0%
representative James Spillane uh emailed
 
01:17:29.630 --> 01:17:29.640 align:start position:0%
you on Wednesday morning
 
01:17:31.850 --> 01:17:31.860 align:start position:0%
um I I I'm not looking for an answer to
 
01:17:33.110 --> 01:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
the question but you're gonna you're
 
01:17:35.209 --> 01:17:35.219 align:start position:0%
gonna answer him okay I figured you
 
01:17:40.149 --> 01:17:40.159 align:start position:0%
would uh and he points out that
 
01:17:43.729 --> 01:17:43.739 align:start position:0%
fb1554 a few years ago said that all
 
01:17:46.209 --> 01:17:46.219 align:start position:0%
registration must be done by September
 
01:17:49.189 --> 01:17:49.199 align:start position:0%
125. am I hearing you say that we're not
 
01:17:51.770 --> 01:17:51.780 align:start position:0%
going to meet that date or we will but
 
01:17:54.950 --> 01:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
we're going to do it in phases
 
01:17:58.610 --> 01:17:58.620 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:01.550 --> 01:18:01.560 align:start position:0%
Captain Michael Eastman a conservation
 
01:18:04.430 --> 01:18:04.440 align:start position:0%
officer law enforcement uh with I'm
 
01:18:06.169 --> 01:18:06.179 align:start position:0%
actually the coordinator for ohrv
 
01:18:10.250 --> 01:18:10.260 align:start position:0%
enforcement registrations and safety uh
 
01:18:11.870 --> 01:18:11.880 align:start position:0%
I believe what he was what
 
01:18:13.189 --> 01:18:13.199 align:start position:0%
representative display was speaking
 
01:18:20.890 --> 01:18:20.900 align:start position:0%
about was uh RSA 215a uh 45 and 215 c59
 
01:18:23.510 --> 01:18:23.520 align:start position:0%
and those are actually the laws that
 
01:18:25.910 --> 01:18:25.920 align:start position:0%
were that went along with um with
 
01:18:28.729 --> 01:18:28.739 align:start position:0%
creating this online system what those
 
01:18:28.739 --> 01:18:29.870 align:start position:0%
creating this online system what those
say

01:18:29.870 --> 01:18:29.880 align:start position:0%
say
 
01:18:31.970 --> 01:18:31.980 align:start position:0%
um in our interpretation of them and
 
01:18:34.010 --> 01:18:34.020 align:start position:0%
what the intent of when and I was a
 
01:18:37.189 --> 01:18:37.199 align:start position:0%
large part of this was that
 
01:18:40.310 --> 01:18:40.320 align:start position:0%
we agreed to the renewal program and
 
01:18:42.410 --> 01:18:42.420 align:start position:0%
what the law says is that we would that
 
01:18:44.570 --> 01:18:44.580 align:start position:0%
the executive director would
 
01:18:46.310 --> 01:18:46.320 align:start position:0%
basically put together what the
 
01:18:47.810 --> 01:18:47.820 align:start position:0%
proceedings for that would be or what
 
01:18:50.270 --> 01:18:50.280 align:start position:0%
the process would be for that
 
01:18:52.310 --> 01:18:52.320 align:start position:0%
um and not that that the process would
 
01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.090 align:start position:0%
um and not that that the process would
be

01:18:53.090 --> 01:18:53.100 align:start position:0%
be
 
01:18:55.610 --> 01:18:55.620 align:start position:0%
renewals and knew that it was actually
 
01:18:57.229 --> 01:18:57.239 align:start position:0%
the renewal program and that that
 
01:19:00.290 --> 01:19:00.300 align:start position:0%
processes that came together and that's
 
01:19:03.290 --> 01:19:03.300 align:start position:0%
the whole workings from going online and
 
01:19:06.169 --> 01:19:06.179 align:start position:0%
getting it or doing the registration and
 
01:19:08.110 --> 01:19:08.120 align:start position:0%
then receiving it
 
01:19:12.430 --> 01:19:12.440 align:start position:0%
afterwards is that process so therefore
 
01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
the law does does not specifically say
 
01:19:18.169 --> 01:19:18.179 align:start position:0%
that it has to be both I mean it's our
 
01:19:19.790 --> 01:19:19.800 align:start position:0%
intent in the down the road that that
 
01:19:21.229 --> 01:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
would happen
 
01:19:21.239 --> 01:19:26.090 align:start position:0%
would happen
um

01:19:26.090 --> 01:19:26.100 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:29.810 --> 01:19:29.820 align:start position:0%
follow-up so I I guess I'm kind of also
 
01:19:32.649 --> 01:19:32.659 align:start position:0%
just looking for a yes or no September 1
 
01:19:35.870 --> 01:19:35.880 align:start position:0%
2025 is the deadline I understand that's
 
01:19:37.669 --> 01:19:37.679 align:start position:0%
what made it into law
 
01:19:40.669 --> 01:19:40.679 align:start position:0%
for all registrations are are we going
 
01:19:42.649 --> 01:19:42.659 align:start position:0%
to meet that deadline are we going to
 
01:19:44.270 --> 01:19:44.280 align:start position:0%
get there in phases are we going to be
 
01:19:46.610 --> 01:19:46.620 align:start position:0%
late I'm just looking for project status
 
01:19:49.970 --> 01:19:49.980 align:start position:0%
not the whole detail
 
01:19:51.830 --> 01:19:51.840 align:start position:0%
um at this point I would say that we
 
01:19:54.229 --> 01:19:54.239 align:start position:0%
will have a renewal online done by
 
01:19:57.229 --> 01:19:57.239 align:start position:0%
September of 25 and then we as I say we
 
01:19:59.870 --> 01:19:59.880 align:start position:0%
will move into original registrations
 
01:20:02.110 --> 01:20:02.120 align:start position:0%
probably post
 
01:20:06.110 --> 01:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
925. all right so so all right mayor it
 
01:20:07.910 --> 01:20:07.920 align:start position:0%
recommend some public messaging this is
 
01:20:09.590 --> 01:20:09.600 align:start position:0%
one of the few things where I'm already
 
01:20:12.070 --> 01:20:12.080 align:start position:0%
getting hate mail from constituents so
 
01:20:15.530 --> 01:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
I'm really glad that it's not in DHHS it
 
01:20:17.030 --> 01:20:17.040 align:start position:0%
kind of gives me something different to
 
01:20:20.570 --> 01:20:20.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:22.430 align:start position:0%
 
representative

01:20:22.430 --> 01:20:22.440 align:start position:0%
representative
 
01:20:26.149 --> 01:20:26.159 align:start position:0%
I'd just like to read the law
 
01:20:27.590 --> 01:20:27.600 align:start position:0%
it states
 
01:20:30.470 --> 01:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
the executive director Xiao no later
 
01:20:32.930 --> 01:20:32.940 align:start position:0%
than September 1st 2025
 
01:20:35.209 --> 01:20:35.219 align:start position:0%
establish any procedures that may be
 
01:20:35.219 --> 01:20:36.350 align:start position:0%
establish any procedures that may be
necessary

01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:36.360 align:start position:0%
necessary
 
01:20:38.870 --> 01:20:38.880 align:start position:0%
to enable the online payment of
 
01:20:41.870 --> 01:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
registration fees required or imposed
 
01:20:43.310 --> 01:20:43.320 align:start position:0%
under this chapter
 
01:20:45.290 --> 01:20:45.300 align:start position:0%
and I've been getting like others I
 
01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:47.760 align:start position:0%
guess mail from folks not just regarding
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
our constituents in New Hampshire but
 
01:20:51.649 --> 01:20:51.659 align:start position:0%
apparently we're the only state in
 
01:20:53.390 --> 01:20:53.400 align:start position:0%
Northern New England that doesn't have
 
01:20:55.910 --> 01:20:55.920 align:start position:0%
this available so out of state people
 
01:20:58.130 --> 01:20:58.140 align:start position:0%
tend to go to Vermont and Maine even
 
01:21:00.169 --> 01:21:00.179 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts because they can basically
 
01:21:03.410 --> 01:21:03.420 align:start position:0%
pop online register their machine and go
 
01:21:05.390 --> 01:21:05.400 align:start position:0%
snowmobiling whereas they can't do that
 
01:21:07.250 --> 01:21:07.260 align:start position:0%
and come to New Hampshire which means
 
01:21:09.050 --> 01:21:09.060 align:start position:0%
we're losing as I understand it I'm not
 
01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:11.219 align:start position:0%
a snowmobile this I'm not an expert but
 
01:21:14.090 --> 01:21:14.100 align:start position:0%
we're losing uh tourist dollars thank
 
01:21:14.100 --> 01:21:16.550 align:start position:0%
we're losing uh tourist dollars thank
you

01:21:16.550 --> 01:21:16.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:16.560 --> 01:21:19.970 align:start position:0%
 
Mr

01:21:19.970 --> 01:21:19.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:21:22.330 --> 01:21:22.340 align:start position:0%
Dallas Andrew
 
01:21:26.169 --> 01:21:26.179 align:start position:0%
I too have been receiving uh
 
01:21:29.090 --> 01:21:29.100 align:start position:0%
notices about this problem about the
 
01:21:31.010 --> 01:21:31.020 align:start position:0%
registration I think it's becoming a
 
01:21:32.510 --> 01:21:32.520 align:start position:0%
significant issue
 
01:21:34.669 --> 01:21:34.679 align:start position:0%
as to as to when it's going to be done
 
01:21:36.890 --> 01:21:36.900 align:start position:0%
uh and and how it's going to be done and
 
01:21:38.570 --> 01:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
there are those who believe you have the
 
01:21:40.790 --> 01:21:40.800 align:start position:0%
ability to do it now
 
01:21:45.290 --> 01:21:45.300 align:start position:0%
and it is is that the case uh why is it
 
01:21:47.570 --> 01:21:47.580 align:start position:0%
being stalled I don't believe we do have
 
01:21:49.669 --> 01:21:49.679 align:start position:0%
the ability to do it now because we have
 
01:21:53.149 --> 01:21:53.159 align:start position:0%
other uh other issues that are facing
 
01:21:56.090 --> 01:21:56.100 align:start position:0%
the department that are requiring us to
 
01:21:58.550 --> 01:21:58.560 align:start position:0%
move forward on as I said we're trying
 
01:22:00.169 --> 01:22:00.179 align:start position:0%
to come into compliance with a law that
 
01:22:02.270 --> 01:22:02.280 align:start position:0%
was passed 10 or 12 years ago on hunting
 
01:22:04.490 --> 01:22:04.500 align:start position:0%
and fishing licenses and we also have to
 
01:22:06.410 --> 01:22:06.420 align:start position:0%
come into compliance with the law on
 
01:22:10.910 --> 01:22:10.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:13.370 --> 01:22:13.380 align:start position:0%
for the point follow up I understand
 
01:22:15.410 --> 01:22:15.420 align:start position:0%
that and I appreciate that
 
01:22:17.209 --> 01:22:17.219 align:start position:0%
but indeed
 
01:22:20.470 --> 01:22:20.480 align:start position:0%
if this isn't on your priority list
 
01:22:23.450 --> 01:22:23.460 align:start position:0%
and there is a lot there's Lauren place
 
01:22:25.189 --> 01:22:25.199 align:start position:0%
that says it should be done and people's
 
01:22:27.709 --> 01:22:27.719 align:start position:0%
perception is that it should be done the
 
01:22:30.350 --> 01:22:30.360 align:start position:0%
public is is uh is being confused at
 
01:22:33.110 --> 01:22:33.120 align:start position:0%
this point in time it is on our priority
 
01:22:34.250 --> 01:22:34.260 align:start position:0%
list but
 
01:22:36.229 --> 01:22:36.239 align:start position:0%
the legislature has actually put it into
 
01:22:39.169 --> 01:22:39.179 align:start position:0%
at least third third on our priority
 
01:22:39.179 --> 01:22:40.669 align:start position:0%
at least third third on our priority
list

01:22:40.669 --> 01:22:40.679 align:start position:0%
list
 
01:22:43.010 --> 01:22:43.020 align:start position:0%
not not first
 
01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:46.320 align:start position:0%
and also as I the other issue is is our
 
01:22:47.689 --> 01:22:47.699 align:start position:0%
database issue that we're trying to
 
01:22:49.850 --> 01:22:49.860 align:start position:0%
solve and of course we have the time
 
01:22:52.010 --> 01:22:52.020 align:start position:0%
constraint on that because it's go for
 
01:22:52.020 --> 01:22:54.350 align:start position:0%
constraint on that because it's go for
funding

01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:54.360 align:start position:0%
funding
 
01:22:58.370 --> 01:22:58.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:00.770 --> 01:23:00.780 align:start position:0%
and we earlier did approve some other
 
01:23:02.870 --> 01:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
funds like from northern borders region
 
01:23:05.750 --> 01:23:05.760 align:start position:0%
to the trails and so on is that any of
 
01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:08.760 align:start position:0%
that help speed this up
 
01:23:10.189 --> 01:23:10.199 align:start position:0%
um no that's not the source of the
 
01:23:12.410 --> 01:23:12.420 align:start position:0%
funding for this
 
01:23:14.750 --> 01:23:14.760 align:start position:0%
representative leishman for a question
 
01:23:17.209 --> 01:23:17.219 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
01:23:19.189 --> 01:23:19.199 align:start position:0%
appearing today so the question I have
 
01:23:21.649 --> 01:23:21.659 align:start position:0%
do you not have the adequate funding to
 
01:23:24.890 --> 01:23:24.900 align:start position:0%
take care of these upgrades or are you
 
01:23:27.110 --> 01:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
working with like our department of
 
01:23:29.270 --> 01:23:29.280 align:start position:0%
Information Technology or is this a
 
01:23:30.830 --> 01:23:30.840 align:start position:0%
contract that you're going to put out to
 
01:23:33.110 --> 01:23:33.120 align:start position:0%
do these upgrades or well it's a
 
01:23:35.090 --> 01:23:35.100 align:start position:0%
contract plus that's also internal staff
 
01:23:35.100 --> 01:23:37.390 align:start position:0%
contract plus that's also internal staff
time

01:23:37.390 --> 01:23:37.400 align:start position:0%
time
 
01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:39.900 align:start position:0%
it's the internal staff time that is
 
01:23:42.110 --> 01:23:42.120 align:start position:0%
probably the largest limiting factor
 
01:23:46.070 --> 01:23:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:48.050 --> 01:23:48.060 align:start position:0%
any further questions from committee
 
01:23:50.149 --> 01:23:50.159 align:start position:0%
members seeing none I'll entertain a
 
01:23:57.410 --> 01:23:57.420 align:start position:0%

01:24:06.530 --> 01:24:06.540 align:start position:0%
1-5 correct
 
01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:16.860 align:start position:0%

the question all in favor say aye I
 
01:24:32.689 --> 01:24:32.699 align:start position:0%
opposed no no I'm going to be a no just
 
01:24:34.970 --> 01:24:34.980 align:start position:0%
because I I think we need some attention
 
01:24:36.229 --> 01:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
on this
 
01:24:41.390 --> 01:24:41.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:43.669 --> 01:24:43.679 align:start position:0%
we got to get something right here
 
01:24:51.770 --> 01:24:51.780 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:54.770 --> 01:24:54.780 align:start position:0%

a question uh thank you Mr chair uh good
 
01:27:37.129 --> 01:27:37.139 align:start position:0%
seeing again director Caswell
 
01:27:40.370 --> 01:27:40.380 align:start position:0%
um last time we met was not that long
 
01:27:43.250 --> 01:27:43.260 align:start position:0%
ago and and I asked you a tough homework
 
01:27:46.250 --> 01:27:46.260 align:start position:0%
problem I asked you if we had any
 
01:27:49.550 --> 01:27:49.560 align:start position:0%
statistics that would tell us what are
 
01:27:52.250 --> 01:27:52.260 align:start position:0%
our vacancy rate is on rental units in
 
01:27:54.350 --> 01:27:54.360 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
01:27:57.649 --> 01:27:57.659 align:start position:0%
what amount of the total stock is being
 
01:28:00.050 --> 01:28:00.060 align:start position:0%
consumed by people without any
 
01:28:03.050 --> 01:28:03.060 align:start position:0%
assistance and what the percentages are
 
01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.790 align:start position:0%
assistance and what the percentages are
around

01:28:04.790 --> 01:28:04.800 align:start position:0%
around
 
01:28:07.250 --> 01:28:07.260 align:start position:0%
how many units are being rented with
 
01:28:10.430 --> 01:28:10.440 align:start position:0%
rental assistance I posited the theory
 
01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.990 align:start position:0%
rental assistance I posited the theory
that

01:28:11.990 --> 01:28:12.000 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:28:15.770 --> 01:28:15.780 align:start position:0%
our vacancy rate is so small that the
 
01:28:18.830 --> 01:28:18.840 align:start position:0%
supply is so tight that any amount of
 
01:28:22.629 --> 01:28:22.639 align:start position:0%
money that we put into chasing that
 
01:28:26.649 --> 01:28:26.659 align:start position:0%
scarce Supply is probably going to have
 
01:28:29.149 --> 01:28:29.159 align:start position:0%
an abnormal disproportionate
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
inflationary effect that's all from my
 
01:28:38.030 --> 01:28:38.040 align:start position:0%
econ 101 40 years ago so so I was asking
 
01:28:40.850 --> 01:28:40.860 align:start position:0%
you if what you thought of that theory
 
01:28:43.850 --> 01:28:43.860 align:start position:0%
and if you had any data and so could
 
01:28:46.189 --> 01:28:46.199 align:start position:0%
could you tell us well I mean I we did
 
01:28:49.030 --> 01:28:49.040 align:start position:0%
go back and look at if there was any
 
01:28:52.070 --> 01:28:52.080 align:start position:0%
obvious sort of research or data that
 
01:28:53.770 --> 01:28:53.780 align:start position:0%
spoke to the issue of
 
01:28:57.410 --> 01:28:57.420 align:start position:0%
rental subsidy and availability of
 
01:28:59.510 --> 01:28:59.520 align:start position:0%
rental units anywhere in the United
 
01:29:01.610 --> 01:29:01.620 align:start position:0%
States there isn't anything that we've
 
01:29:05.330 --> 01:29:05.340 align:start position:0%
found we have posed that question with
 
01:29:06.709 --> 01:29:06.719 align:start position:0%
some of our partners at New Hampshire
 
01:29:10.010 --> 01:29:10.020 align:start position:0%
Housing Finance Authority to see if
 
01:29:11.570 --> 01:29:11.580 align:start position:0%
there is anything out there that can
 
01:29:12.910 --> 01:29:12.920 align:start position:0%
speak to that at
 
01:29:16.010 --> 01:29:16.020 align:start position:0%
as I think we mentioned at the time of
 
01:29:19.490 --> 01:29:19.500 align:start position:0%
our conversation having said that it
 
01:29:23.209 --> 01:29:23.219 align:start position:0%
the the level of subsidy that comes to
 
01:29:26.629 --> 01:29:26.639 align:start position:0%
the housing market generally outside of
 
01:29:29.390 --> 01:29:29.400 align:start position:0%
this program outside of really sort of
 
01:29:32.030 --> 01:29:32.040 align:start position:0%
any other program that we've talked
 
01:29:33.470 --> 01:29:33.480 align:start position:0%
about at least that I've been involved
 
01:29:36.290 --> 01:29:36.300 align:start position:0%
with on the housing side is is
 
01:29:37.850 --> 01:29:37.860 align:start position:0%
substantial in the United States you
 
01:29:37.860 --> 01:29:39.129 align:start position:0%
substantial in the United States you
have

01:29:39.129 --> 01:29:39.139 align:start position:0%
have
 
01:29:41.209 --> 01:29:41.219 align:start position:0%
subsidies that are for developers
 
01:29:44.149 --> 01:29:44.159 align:start position:0%
subsidies that are for owners subsidies
 
01:29:45.770 --> 01:29:45.780 align:start position:0%
that are for
 
01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:46.729 align:start position:0%
that are for
um

01:29:46.729 --> 01:29:46.739 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:29:51.110 --> 01:29:51.120 align:start position:0%
uh tenants landlords all fairly
 
01:29:53.330 --> 01:29:53.340 align:start position:0%
substantial and all mostly at least in
 
01:29:55.129 --> 01:29:55.139 align:start position:0%
our case here in New Hampshire all
 
01:29:56.510 --> 01:29:56.520 align:start position:0%
administered and funded by the federal
 
01:29:59.629 --> 01:29:59.639 align:start position:0%
government so in this case this
 
01:30:02.750 --> 01:30:02.760 align:start position:0%
particular program was established in
 
01:30:06.890 --> 01:30:06.900 align:start position:0%
March of 2021 in reaction to the covid
 
01:30:09.950 --> 01:30:09.960 align:start position:0%
pandemic so these funds are specifically
 
01:30:12.709 --> 01:30:12.719 align:start position:0%
for a population that I could
 
01:30:16.669 --> 01:30:16.679 align:start position:0%
demonstrate an impact from covid and in
 
01:30:18.830 --> 01:30:18.840 align:start position:0%
most cases is assisting those
 
01:30:20.629 --> 01:30:20.639 align:start position:0%
individuals to stay in the housing that
 
01:30:24.169 --> 01:30:24.179 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:27.410 --> 01:30:27.420 align:start position:0%
follow up okay so I appreciate this is
 
01:30:29.810 --> 01:30:29.820 align:start position:0%
really a complex area I'm predisposed to
 
01:30:34.430 --> 01:30:34.440 align:start position:0%
proving this I I I I I just lose just a
 
01:30:36.470 --> 01:30:36.480 align:start position:0%
little bit of sleep at night thinking
 
01:30:38.570 --> 01:30:38.580 align:start position:0%
that in the attempt to do good by
 
01:30:40.729 --> 01:30:40.739 align:start position:0%
providing rental assistance into a
 
01:30:43.669 --> 01:30:43.679 align:start position:0%
market that has a very tight scarcity of
 
01:30:46.790 --> 01:30:46.800 align:start position:0%
vacancies that were we may accidentally
 
01:30:49.430 --> 01:30:49.440 align:start position:0%
be doing harm to the people that don't
 
01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:50.600 align:start position:0%
have rental
 
01:30:53.149 --> 01:30:53.159 align:start position:0%
assistance because their rents will go
 
01:30:55.910 --> 01:30:55.920 align:start position:0%
up without the kind of help that others
 
01:30:59.209 --> 01:30:59.219 align:start position:0%
are getting so so just as that's me
 
01:31:00.649 --> 01:31:00.659 align:start position:0%
telling you I can't sleep well enough
 
01:31:03.169 --> 01:31:03.179 align:start position:0%
the the the the the part I do want to
 
01:31:05.450 --> 01:31:05.460 align:start position:0%
tell you about is I've been talking to
 
01:31:09.290 --> 01:31:09.300 align:start position:0%
Mr Ben Frost yes and uh in the last
 
01:31:11.270 --> 01:31:11.280 align:start position:0%
couple of days communicated with them
 
01:31:14.510 --> 01:31:14.520 align:start position:0%
and it seems to me like he understands
 
01:31:18.530 --> 01:31:18.540 align:start position:0%
the kind of uh problem I'm concerned
 
01:31:20.810 --> 01:31:20.820 align:start position:0%
about and these researching it and
 
01:31:22.669 --> 01:31:22.679 align:start position:0%
trying to pull together as much data as
 
01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:24.840 align:start position:0%
he can so to the extent that you guys
 
01:31:26.510 --> 01:31:26.520 align:start position:0%
are in communication you know maybe
 
01:31:28.490 --> 01:31:28.500 align:start position:0%
maybe you can come up with a better
 
01:31:30.530 --> 01:31:30.540 align:start position:0%
product yeah we we work with them
 
01:31:32.689 --> 01:31:32.699 align:start position:0%
regularly and I'm aware of that that
 
01:31:36.169 --> 01:31:36.179 align:start position:0%
effort yes sir all right thank you
 
01:31:41.149 --> 01:31:41.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:42.770 --> 01:31:42.780 align:start position:0%
Senator D'Alessandro has a question
 
01:31:44.570 --> 01:31:44.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:31:47.149 --> 01:31:47.159 align:start position:0%
first of all thanks for coming before us
 
01:31:49.490 --> 01:31:49.500 align:start position:0%
and with the with the late item
 
01:31:51.350 --> 01:31:51.360 align:start position:0%
temporary housing where are these are
 
01:31:54.430 --> 01:31:54.440 align:start position:0%
these people all Hotel people no sir
 
01:31:57.050 --> 01:31:57.060 align:start position:0%
this that's a separate uh issue as you
 
01:31:58.550 --> 01:31:58.560 align:start position:0%
know that we've discussed in the past so
 
01:32:01.370 --> 01:32:01.380 align:start position:0%
these are uh this is the what we call
 
01:32:04.250 --> 01:32:04.260 align:start position:0%
now the regular emergency rental
 
01:32:06.229 --> 01:32:06.239 align:start position:0%
assistance program that is administered
 
01:32:09.530 --> 01:32:09.540 align:start position:0%
by nifa for people who are in housing
 
01:32:09.540 --> 01:32:11.510 align:start position:0%
by nifa for people who are in housing
already

01:32:11.510 --> 01:32:11.520 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:32:13.970 --> 01:32:13.980 align:start position:0%
for the question now when you when you
 
01:32:16.370 --> 01:32:16.380 align:start position:0%
say in housing already
 
01:32:18.649 --> 01:32:18.659 align:start position:0%
what housing are we talking about it
 
01:32:20.629 --> 01:32:20.639 align:start position:0%
could be any type of housing rental
 
01:32:23.629 --> 01:32:23.639 align:start position:0%
housing in the state that they're that
 
01:32:25.669 --> 01:32:25.679 align:start position:0%
they're that they apply for funding
 
01:32:28.970 --> 01:32:28.980 align:start position:0%
under this program through the local cap
 
01:32:31.550 --> 01:32:31.560 align:start position:0%
um and that that those rents are funded
 
01:32:34.669 --> 01:32:34.679 align:start position:0%
under this program so uh for for the
 
01:32:37.070 --> 01:32:37.080 align:start position:0%
question so so could this be uh the
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:44.149 --> 01:32:44.159 align:start position:0%
could this I mean could we be paying uh
 
01:32:48.110 --> 01:32:48.120 align:start position:0%
we could be yes yes okay and just one
 
01:32:51.649 --> 01:32:51.659 align:start position:0%
last time this is this is situ this is a
 
01:32:54.890 --> 01:32:54.900 align:start position:0%
situation that has a very finite value
 
01:32:58.610 --> 01:32:58.620 align:start position:0%
and and the the question is what's next
 
01:33:02.090 --> 01:33:02.100 align:start position:0%
and when the subsidy disappears that's
 
01:33:04.070 --> 01:33:04.080 align:start position:0%
that's a problem but where do the people
 
01:33:07.610 --> 01:33:07.620 align:start position:0%
go to me that's the real problem
 
01:33:10.070 --> 01:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
I agree and there are uh you know with
 
01:33:11.950 --> 01:33:11.960 align:start position:0%
this program as we've discussed before
 
01:33:14.330 --> 01:33:14.340 align:start position:0%
there are a large number of services
 
01:33:16.370 --> 01:33:16.380 align:start position:0%
that are also funded under this program
 
01:33:18.729 --> 01:33:18.739 align:start position:0%
that are just for that purpose because
 
01:33:21.290 --> 01:33:21.300 align:start position:0%
obviously when this program began we
 
01:33:24.470 --> 01:33:24.480 align:start position:0%
began we began this program back in 2021
 
01:33:26.510 --> 01:33:26.520 align:start position:0%
with the full knowledge that it was a
 
01:33:28.490 --> 01:33:28.500 align:start position:0%
finite amount of resource that was going
 
01:33:29.870 --> 01:33:29.880 align:start position:0%
to be available
 
01:33:29.880 --> 01:33:30.830 align:start position:0%
to be available
plant

01:33:30.830 --> 01:33:30.840 align:start position:0%
plant
 
01:33:32.570 --> 01:33:32.580 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman
 
01:33:35.270 --> 01:33:35.280 align:start position:0%
Senator bird cell for a question
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
Mr how much of this out this rental
 
01:33:47.270 --> 01:33:47.280 align:start position:0%
assistant actually goes to the landlords
 
01:33:49.430 --> 01:33:49.440 align:start position:0%
a good point all of it does
 
01:33:52.189 --> 01:33:52.199 align:start position:0%
it go directly to the land yes
 
01:33:59.209 --> 01:33:59.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:04.189 --> 01:34:04.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:06.950 --> 01:34:06.960 align:start position:0%
we've got a question first from uh
 
01:34:09.229 --> 01:34:09.239 align:start position:0%
Senator leishman a representative Alicia
 
01:34:11.270 --> 01:34:11.280 align:start position:0%
I'll take that a second time that's fine
 
01:34:15.110 --> 01:34:15.120 align:start position:0%
yeah I thought I'd only make it once
 
01:34:18.350 --> 01:34:18.360 align:start position:0%
a follow-up if I could to uh Senator
 
01:34:21.590 --> 01:34:21.600 align:start position:0%
birdsall's question uh what is the
 
01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:25.080 align:start position:0%
amount of money per individual landlord
 
01:34:26.930 --> 01:34:26.940 align:start position:0%
do you have like a rough estimate are
 
01:34:28.010 --> 01:34:28.020 align:start position:0%
they getting
 
01:34:31.910 --> 01:34:31.920 align:start position:0%
500 a thousand dollars a month and how
 
01:34:36.669 --> 01:34:36.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:38.629 --> 01:34:38.639 align:start position:0%
deputy director at gopher it's a great
 
01:34:40.189 --> 01:34:40.199 align:start position:0%
question representative
 
01:34:42.590 --> 01:34:42.600 align:start position:0%
um the amount of money uh amount of
 
01:34:44.930 --> 01:34:44.940 align:start position:0%
money awarded assistance is is tracked
 
01:34:46.970 --> 01:34:46.980 align:start position:0%
per household the program is just
 
01:34:48.709 --> 01:34:48.719 align:start position:0%
structured so that the landlord is
 
01:34:50.990 --> 01:34:51.000 align:start position:0%
largely almost exclusively paid directly
 
01:34:52.970 --> 01:34:52.980 align:start position:0%
as opposed to giving the funds to the
 
01:34:55.490 --> 01:34:55.500 align:start position:0%
tenant to then give it to the landlord
 
01:34:58.430 --> 01:34:58.440 align:start position:0%
um the assistant assistance number uh
 
01:35:00.169 --> 01:35:00.179 align:start position:0%
per household has grown over time as you
 
01:35:02.090 --> 01:35:02.100 align:start position:0%
might expect since it's been going on
 
01:35:03.430 --> 01:35:03.440 align:start position:0%
for a couple years I believe it's around
 
01:35:06.110 --> 01:35:06.120 align:start position:0%
between nine and ten thousand dollars on
 
01:35:07.970 --> 01:35:07.980 align:start position:0%
average per household over the over the
 
01:35:10.430 --> 01:35:10.440 align:start position:0%
course of the program
 
01:35:13.669 --> 01:35:13.679 align:start position:0%
a follow-up per household per year per
 
01:35:15.530 --> 01:35:15.540 align:start position:0%
month on average over the whole program
 
01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:18.060 align:start position:0%
the pro you max out an assistance at 18
 
01:35:19.669 --> 01:35:19.679 align:start position:0%
months for the program so it's a per
 
01:35:21.110 --> 01:35:21.120 align:start position:0%
household over the life of their
 
01:35:21.120 --> 01:35:22.790 align:start position:0%
household over the life of their
eligibility

01:35:22.790 --> 01:35:22.800 align:start position:0%
eligibility
 
01:35:26.030 --> 01:35:26.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman thank you
 
01:35:27.770 --> 01:35:27.780 align:start position:0%
okay I have a motion from Senator
 
01:35:31.189 --> 01:35:31.199 align:start position:0%

seeing none you're ready for the
 
01:35:39.950 --> 01:35:39.960 align:start position:0%
question all in favor say aye opposed no
 
01:35:43.970 --> 01:35:43.980 align:start position:0%
item 23041 is adopted
 
01:35:45.950 --> 01:35:45.960 align:start position:0%
on the
 
01:35:48.590 --> 01:35:48.600 align:start position:0%
informational materials anybody have any
 
01:35:50.810 --> 01:35:50.820 align:start position:0%
questions that they want to
 
01:35:56.629 --> 01:35:56.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:00.169 --> 01:36:00.179 align:start position:0%
Senator Rosenwald on the DHHS dashboard
 
01:36:04.129 --> 01:36:04.139 align:start position:0%
I have one question okay item 23040 the
 
01:36:04.139 --> 01:36:05.450 align:start position:0%
I have one question okay item 23040 the
dashboard

01:36:05.450 --> 01:36:05.460 align:start position:0%
dashboard
 
01:36:09.590 --> 01:36:09.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:11.930 --> 01:36:11.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:36:14.330 --> 01:36:14.340 align:start position:0%
um on table eight
 
01:36:19.129 --> 01:36:19.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:19.139 --> 01:36:19.790 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:36:19.790 --> 01:36:19.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:22.850 --> 01:36:22.860 align:start position:0%
the adult adults
 
01:36:25.430 --> 01:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
seen in the community mental health
 
01:36:25.440 --> 01:36:26.930 align:start position:0%
seen in the community mental health
system

01:36:26.930 --> 01:36:26.940 align:start position:0%
system
 
01:36:30.649 --> 01:36:30.659 align:start position:0%
that caseload is still running at
 
01:36:36.229 --> 01:36:36.239 align:start position:0%
50 percent of pre-pandemic levels
 
01:36:38.709 --> 01:36:38.719 align:start position:0%
um I know there are a lot of vacancies
 
01:36:42.370 --> 01:36:42.380 align:start position:0%
in that system but
 
01:36:44.810 --> 01:36:44.820 align:start position:0%
what are we going to see from the
 
01:36:46.570 --> 01:36:46.580 align:start position:0%
Department to
 
01:36:49.250 --> 01:36:49.260 align:start position:0%
increase the number of people who get
 
01:36:50.990 --> 01:36:51.000 align:start position:0%
treated in the community
 
01:36:53.209 --> 01:36:53.219 align:start position:0%
before they end up in a full-blown
 
01:36:53.219 --> 01:36:54.709 align:start position:0%
before they end up in a full-blown
crisis

01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:54.719 align:start position:0%
crisis
 
01:36:56.390 --> 01:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
stuck in the emergency department
 
01:36:58.810 --> 01:36:58.820 align:start position:0%
waiting for a bet at the most expensive
 
01:37:04.550 --> 01:37:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:06.890 --> 01:37:06.900 align:start position:0%
so again for the record I'm Katya Fox
 
01:37:08.330 --> 01:37:08.340 align:start position:0%
I'm the director of the division for
 
01:37:10.790 --> 01:37:10.800 align:start position:0%
Behavioral Health the issue of those
 
01:37:13.610 --> 01:37:13.620 align:start position:0%
numbers has come up previously and I
 
01:37:16.610 --> 01:37:16.620 align:start position:0%
believe that you raised that that data
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
is pulled from a financial system and
 
01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:22.980 align:start position:0%
really fluctuates that's why you see a
 
01:37:24.890 --> 01:37:24.900 align:start position:0%
dip and then you see an increase based
 
01:37:27.830 --> 01:37:27.840 align:start position:0%
on invoicing so we are going to be
 
01:37:31.790 --> 01:37:31.800 align:start position:0%
changing that information we ran the
 
01:37:34.669 --> 01:37:34.679 align:start position:0%
numbers yesterday with data analytics to
 
01:37:38.390 --> 01:37:38.400 align:start position:0%
look at the actual numbers that are
 
01:37:40.310 --> 01:37:40.320 align:start position:0%
through a different system through claim
 
01:37:42.490 --> 01:37:42.500 align:start position:0%
a different claim system and how we
 
01:37:42.500 --> 01:37:44.229 align:start position:0%
a different claim system and how we
categorize

01:37:44.229 --> 01:37:44.239 align:start position:0%
categorize
 
01:37:47.629 --> 01:37:47.639 align:start position:0%
the the data coming in and information
 
01:37:50.450 --> 01:37:50.460 align:start position:0%
coming in you are going to see and I can
 
01:37:52.330 --> 01:37:52.340 align:start position:0%
provide to the committee
 
01:37:55.850 --> 01:37:55.860 align:start position:0%
the actual increase in the number of
 
01:37:58.910 --> 01:37:58.920 align:start position:0%
individuals who've been served in the
 
01:38:01.250 --> 01:38:01.260 align:start position:0%
last three or four years so you're going
 
01:38:05.570 --> 01:38:05.580 align:start position:0%
to see an increase not what your
 
01:38:09.530 --> 01:38:09.540 align:start position:0%
um recognizing in the data and that is
 
01:38:11.750 --> 01:38:11.760 align:start position:0%
part of the discussions that we've had
 
01:38:14.209 --> 01:38:14.219 align:start position:0%
about overhauling the entire dashboard
 
01:38:16.430 --> 01:38:16.440 align:start position:0%
and this is one area that we want to
 
01:38:18.709 --> 01:38:18.719 align:start position:0%
focus on so I'd be happy to provide that
 
01:38:21.709 --> 01:38:21.719 align:start position:0%
information that was run yesterday and
 
01:38:23.689 --> 01:38:23.699 align:start position:0%
are we going to start seeing these
 
01:38:26.629 --> 01:38:26.639 align:start position:0%
correct numbers soon
 
01:38:29.090 --> 01:38:29.100 align:start position:0%
so it will probably still be a couple of
 
01:38:30.350 --> 01:38:30.360 align:start position:0%
months before we have an updated
 
01:38:33.350 --> 01:38:33.360 align:start position:0%
dashboard capacity is an issue you've
 
01:38:35.090 --> 01:38:35.100 align:start position:0%
seen our vacancy rates north of 20
 
01:38:38.629 --> 01:38:38.639 align:start position:0%
percent so finding the time to to devote
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
to that update has been challenging
 
01:38:42.850 --> 01:38:42.860 align:start position:0%
however what we do want to do
 
01:38:46.189 --> 01:38:46.199 align:start position:0%
with the new dashboard is provide more
 
01:38:48.709 --> 01:38:48.719 align:start position:0%
visual demonstration and charts so that
 
01:38:50.209 --> 01:38:50.219 align:start position:0%
you're not having to go through each one
 
01:38:51.770 --> 01:38:51.780 align:start position:0%
of these to come to your own conclusion
 
01:38:55.610 --> 01:38:55.620 align:start position:0%
that you'll see some more whether it's
 
01:38:57.770 --> 01:38:57.780 align:start position:0%
pie charts or Trends or graphs with
 
01:38:59.810 --> 01:38:59.820 align:start position:0%
trend lines it'll be a little bit easier
 
01:39:01.729 --> 01:39:01.739 align:start position:0%
for everybody to quickly look at that
 
01:39:05.629 --> 01:39:05.639 align:start position:0%
and pull away the conclusions So within
 
01:39:07.550 --> 01:39:07.560 align:start position:0%
the coming months but it is certainly an
 
01:39:10.310 --> 01:39:10.320 align:start position:0%
overhaul in an effort to get that done
 
01:39:16.070 --> 01:39:16.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:18.350 --> 01:39:18.360 align:start position:0%
any other questions on the informational
 
01:39:21.229 --> 01:39:21.239 align:start position:0%
items that the committee wishes to have
 
01:39:21.239 --> 01:39:25.070 align:start position:0%
items that the committee wishes to have
answered

01:39:25.070 --> 01:39:25.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:27.900 align:start position:0%
all right seeing none
 
01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:30.120 align:start position:0%
Steve Smith as any of your other audit
 
01:39:31.970 --> 01:39:31.980 align:start position:0%
people that have been recognized here in
 
01:39:34.310 --> 01:39:34.320 align:start position:0%
this item
 
01:39:40.189 --> 01:39:40.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:43.910 --> 01:39:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:39:46.090 --> 01:39:46.100 align:start position:0%
Let's uh
 
01:39:49.510 --> 01:39:49.520 align:start position:0%
referring us to item 22
 
01:39:53.629 --> 01:39:53.639 align:start position:0%
429 certificate of impact for the 2019
 
01:39:56.629 --> 01:39:56.639 align:start position:0%
performance audit of the Adult Parole
 
01:39:58.790 --> 01:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
Board his recognition by the National
 
01:40:01.310 --> 01:40:01.320 align:start position:0%
Conference of state legislators
 
01:40:04.070 --> 01:40:04.080 align:start position:0%
National legislative program evaluation
 
01:40:06.830 --> 01:40:06.840 align:start position:0%
gave them a certificate of impact
 
01:40:08.689 --> 01:40:08.699 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:40:11.570 --> 01:40:11.580 align:start position:0%
I wish to uh
 
01:40:15.550 --> 01:40:15.560 align:start position:0%
have us all recognize the performance
 
01:40:18.649 --> 01:40:18.659 align:start position:0%
audit section for the fine work they do
 
01:40:20.570 --> 01:40:20.580 align:start position:0%
and finally others have been have been
 
01:40:20.580 --> 01:40:22.729 align:start position:0%
and finally others have been have been
uh

01:40:22.729 --> 01:40:22.739 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:40:25.490 --> 01:40:25.500 align:start position:0%
recognizing it as well so
 
01:40:27.770 --> 01:40:27.780 align:start position:0%
let's put this on the agenda again in
 
01:40:29.209 --> 01:40:29.219 align:start position:0%
case some of these people show up
 
01:40:31.189 --> 01:40:31.199 align:start position:0%
another time
 
01:40:33.050 --> 01:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
I do I do want to have some recognition
 
01:40:34.910 --> 01:40:34.920 align:start position:0%
for you staff and I appreciate all the
 
01:40:37.070 --> 01:40:37.080 align:start position:0%
work you do thank you I'll definitely
 
01:40:39.229 --> 01:40:39.239 align:start position:0%
pass that along so
 
01:40:44.410 --> 01:40:44.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:47.390 --> 01:40:47.400 align:start position:0%
a lot more credit than I do so all right
 
01:40:50.209 --> 01:40:50.219 align:start position:0%
so now we move on to the Audits and
 
01:40:52.430 --> 01:40:52.440 align:start position:0%
recognizing Stephen Smith director of
 
01:40:53.990 --> 01:40:54.000 align:start position:0%
audits okay
 
01:40:56.510 --> 01:40:56.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair I was advised that
 
01:40:59.810 --> 01:40:59.820 align:start position:0%
going back to the state actor which KPMG
 
01:41:02.149 --> 01:41:02.159 align:start position:0%
presented admin Services doesn't have
 
01:41:04.370 --> 01:41:04.380 align:start position:0%
any prepared comments at this time so
 
01:41:06.410 --> 01:41:06.420 align:start position:0%
unless there's no question any committee
 
01:41:08.149 --> 01:41:08.159 align:start position:0%
has any questions we can move into the
 
01:41:08.159 --> 01:41:09.290 align:start position:0%
has any questions we can move into the
turnpike

01:41:09.290 --> 01:41:09.300 align:start position:0%
turnpike
 
01:41:09.300 --> 01:41:12.590 align:start position:0%
turnpike
presentation

01:41:12.590 --> 01:41:12.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:14.689 --> 01:41:14.699 align:start position:0%
any questions on any other audits that
 
01:41:18.470 --> 01:41:18.480 align:start position:0%
we had covered earlier by KPMG
 
01:41:20.450 --> 01:41:20.460 align:start position:0%
seeing none will move on to the turnpike
 
01:41:20.460 --> 01:41:26.450 align:start position:0%
seeing none will move on to the turnpike
audit

01:41:26.450 --> 01:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:28.729 --> 01:41:28.739 align:start position:0%
which we have already had a motion to
 
01:41:30.590 --> 01:41:30.600 align:start position:0%
accept place on file and release in the
 
01:41:32.270 --> 01:41:32.280 align:start position:0%
usual manner so now we're going to have
 
01:41:35.390 --> 01:41:35.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
joining me at the table is uh Bob
 
01:41:40.010 --> 01:41:40.020 align:start position:0%
Mahoney he's the partner with KPMG that
 
01:41:42.649 --> 01:41:42.659 align:start position:0%
did the turnpike audit and from the
 
01:41:45.229 --> 01:41:45.239 align:start position:0%
system is Danielle
 
01:41:45.239 --> 01:41:46.609 align:start position:0%
system is Danielle
Chardonnay

01:41:46.609 --> 01:41:46.619 align:start position:0%
Chardonnay
 
01:41:48.890 --> 01:41:48.900 align:start position:0%
chandanae I got close there and Andre
 
01:41:51.290 --> 01:41:51.300 align:start position:0%
Brier the Deputy Commissioner so I'll
 
01:41:54.109 --> 01:41:54.119 align:start position:0%
turn it over to uh Mr Mahoney
 
01:41:55.850 --> 01:41:55.860 align:start position:0%
thanks Steve again for the record Bob
 
01:41:59.030 --> 01:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
Mahoney ought to partner with KPMG so in
 
01:42:01.010 --> 01:42:01.020 align:start position:0%
the materials you should have a copy of
 
01:42:04.070 --> 01:42:04.080 align:start position:0%
the turnpike financial statements as
 
01:42:07.070 --> 01:42:07.080 align:start position:0%
well as the internal control over
 
01:42:08.570 --> 01:42:08.580 align:start position:0%
financial reporting and compliance and
 
01:42:09.830 --> 01:42:09.840 align:start position:0%
other matters also known as the yellow
 
01:42:11.030 --> 01:42:11.040 align:start position:0%
book report
 
01:42:13.990 --> 01:42:14.000 align:start position:0%
and lastly the debt compliance letter
 
01:42:16.609 --> 01:42:16.619 align:start position:0%
I'll first speak to the financial
 
01:42:19.729 --> 01:42:19.739 align:start position:0%
statement so the opinion on the turnpike
 
01:42:21.770 --> 01:42:21.780 align:start position:0%
financial statements uh this year was
 
01:42:24.770 --> 01:42:24.780 align:start position:0%
unmodified also known as a clean opinion
 
01:42:27.530 --> 01:42:27.540 align:start position:0%
so congratulations to Danielle and her
 
01:42:29.689 --> 01:42:29.699 align:start position:0%
team for all the hard work that they do
 
01:42:31.810 --> 01:42:31.820 align:start position:0%
to prepare the financial statements
 
01:42:35.390 --> 01:42:35.400 align:start position:0%
the opinion indicates that management is
 
01:42:37.310 --> 01:42:37.320 align:start position:0%
ultimately responsible for the accuracy
 
01:42:38.930 --> 01:42:38.940 align:start position:0%
of the financial statements and we are
 
01:42:40.970 --> 01:42:40.980 align:start position:0%
responsible for expressing an opinion on
 
01:42:43.010 --> 01:42:43.020 align:start position:0%
the financial statements we conducted
 
01:42:44.629 --> 01:42:44.639 align:start position:0%
our audit in accordance with generally
 
01:42:46.790 --> 01:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
accepted auditing standards in the U.S
 
01:42:50.270 --> 01:42:50.280 align:start position:0%
as well as Government auditing standards
 
01:42:52.430 --> 01:42:52.440 align:start position:0%
um in addition uh the opinion of
 
01:42:54.709 --> 01:42:54.719 align:start position:0%
references uh the separate report which
 
01:42:56.570 --> 01:42:56.580 align:start position:0%
I indicated earlier the report on
 
01:42:58.189 --> 01:42:58.199 align:start position:0%
internal control of financial reporting
 
01:43:01.310 --> 01:43:01.320 align:start position:0%
and compliance in that report uh you
 
01:43:03.590 --> 01:43:03.600 align:start position:0%
will see that we did identify one
 
01:43:06.229 --> 01:43:06.239 align:start position:0%
significant deficiency during the course
 
01:43:09.290 --> 01:43:09.300 align:start position:0%
of the audit uh related to the turnpike
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
systems implementation of the gasby 87
 
01:43:14.890 --> 01:43:14.900 align:start position:0%
lease standard which was new this year
 
01:43:18.530 --> 01:43:18.540 align:start position:0%
management did not properly reflect the
 
01:43:20.330 --> 01:43:20.340 align:start position:0%
accounting in the initial draft of the
 
01:43:22.370 --> 01:43:22.380 align:start position:0%
financial statements related to an
 
01:43:25.370 --> 01:43:25.380 align:start position:0%
existing ground lease so that was
 
01:43:27.830 --> 01:43:27.840 align:start position:0%
corrected in the financial statements
 
01:43:29.689 --> 01:43:29.699 align:start position:0%
that were ultimately issued but we did
 
01:43:31.189 --> 01:43:31.199 align:start position:0%
identify a significant deficiency
 
01:43:34.129 --> 01:43:34.139 align:start position:0%
however we did not identify any material
 
01:43:37.129 --> 01:43:37.139 align:start position:0%
weaknesses and internal control in that
 
01:43:40.129 --> 01:43:40.139 align:start position:0%
report so you will see that and happy to
 
01:43:42.470 --> 01:43:42.480 align:start position:0%
answer any questions as well and then
 
01:43:44.930 --> 01:43:44.940 align:start position:0%
lastly the debt compliance report
 
01:43:48.410 --> 01:43:48.420 align:start position:0%
um that that report basically indicates
 
01:43:52.970 --> 01:43:52.980 align:start position:0%
that we review viewed the provisions and
 
01:43:54.290 --> 01:43:54.300 align:start position:0%
Covenants associated with the bond
 
01:43:56.270 --> 01:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
resolutions of the turnpike and
 
01:43:58.070 --> 01:43:58.080 align:start position:0%
determined that the turnpike was in
 
01:43:59.810 --> 01:43:59.820 align:start position:0%
compliance with the covenants and
 
01:43:59.820 --> 01:44:01.570 align:start position:0%
compliance with the covenants and
Provisions

01:44:01.570 --> 01:44:01.580 align:start position:0%
Provisions
 
01:44:03.830 --> 01:44:03.840 align:start position:0%
and lastly I'll just go through some of
 
01:44:05.209 --> 01:44:05.219 align:start position:0%
the required Communications to the
 
01:44:07.850 --> 01:44:07.860 align:start position:0%
committee so there were no significant
 
01:44:10.129 --> 01:44:10.139 align:start position:0%
and unusual transactions during the
 
01:44:12.770 --> 01:44:12.780 align:start position:0%
course of the audit there was one
 
01:44:15.109 --> 01:44:15.119 align:start position:0%
uncorrected misstatement which is
 
01:44:18.229 --> 01:44:18.239 align:start position:0%
consistent with prior years related to
 
01:44:21.950 --> 01:44:21.960 align:start position:0%
the fact that the trusted opeb liability
 
01:44:24.229 --> 01:44:24.239 align:start position:0%
does not get allocated to the turnpike
 
01:44:26.570 --> 01:44:26.580 align:start position:0%
the state records the entire trusted
 
01:44:27.950 --> 01:44:27.960 align:start position:0%
opeb liability on its financial
 
01:44:30.169 --> 01:44:30.179 align:start position:0%
statements so that continues to be an
 
01:44:32.689 --> 01:44:32.699 align:start position:0%
uncorrected misstatement again only 1.1
 
01:44:35.390 --> 01:44:35.400 align:start position:0%
million dollars that's not allocated to
 
01:44:37.310 --> 01:44:37.320 align:start position:0%
the turnpike
 
01:44:40.970 --> 01:44:40.980 align:start position:0%
um as I mentioned no excuse me sure Mr
 
01:44:43.930 --> 01:44:43.940 align:start position:0%
chair representative Edwards is
 
01:44:47.330 --> 01:44:47.340 align:start position:0%
oped is is that an acronym and if you're
 
01:44:49.729 --> 01:44:49.739 align:start position:0%
going to use acronyms for us civilians
 
01:44:52.129 --> 01:44:52.139 align:start position:0%
could you spell it out the first time
 
01:44:53.689 --> 01:44:53.699 align:start position:0%
you use it yeah please other
 
01:44:56.470 --> 01:44:56.480 align:start position:0%
post-employment benefits that's great
 
01:45:00.470 --> 01:45:00.480 align:start position:0%
thanks and I know what a fast B is and
 
01:45:02.270 --> 01:45:02.280 align:start position:0%
you but you said that we had a material
 
01:45:05.810 --> 01:45:05.820 align:start position:0%
weakness on an aspect of it I didn't I
 
01:45:08.270 --> 01:45:08.280 align:start position:0%
didn't pick it all up sure it was it was
 
01:45:10.970 --> 01:45:10.980 align:start position:0%
related to The gasby Standard number 87
 
01:45:14.870 --> 01:45:14.880 align:start position:0%
Gatsby government yes okay yeah the
 
01:45:15.950 --> 01:45:15.960 align:start position:0%
government Accounting Standards
 
01:45:19.729 --> 01:45:19.739 align:start position:0%
statement all right thank you sure
 
01:45:21.890 --> 01:45:21.900 align:start position:0%
um so we did evaluate the significant
 
01:45:23.810 --> 01:45:23.820 align:start position:0%
accounting policies
 
01:45:25.790 --> 01:45:25.800 align:start position:0%
um that the turnpike has in place and
 
01:45:27.770 --> 01:45:27.780 align:start position:0%
determined that they were reasonable uh
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
there was no fraud or illegal acts that
 
01:45:31.550 --> 01:45:31.560 align:start position:0%
we identified during the course of the
 
01:45:34.010 --> 01:45:34.020 align:start position:0%
audit we did not have any disagreements
 
01:45:36.290 --> 01:45:36.300 align:start position:0%
with management and we did not encounter
 
01:45:38.270 --> 01:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
any significant difficulties during the
 
01:45:40.550 --> 01:45:40.560 align:start position:0%
course of the audit either and lastly we
 
01:45:42.709 --> 01:45:42.719 align:start position:0%
are independent with respect to the
 
01:45:45.830 --> 01:45:45.840 align:start position:0%
turnpike as well so happy to answer any
 
01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:47.030 align:start position:0%
turnpike as well so happy to answer any
questions

01:45:47.030 --> 01:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
questions
 
01:45:49.070 --> 01:45:49.080 align:start position:0%
um and uh Danielle if you have any
 
01:45:51.530 --> 01:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
prepared remarks or Andre feel free
 
01:45:53.810 --> 01:45:53.820 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee we
 
01:45:56.810 --> 01:45:56.820 align:start position:0%
uh as you know our Turnpike system is an
 
01:45:58.790 --> 01:45:58.800 align:start position:0%
economic engine for the state as such
 
01:46:01.010 --> 01:46:01.020 align:start position:0%
it's incredibly important for us that
 
01:46:03.109 --> 01:46:03.119 align:start position:0%
we're transparent and we're following
 
01:46:05.649 --> 01:46:05.659 align:start position:0%
good accounting practices we appreciate
 
01:46:08.750 --> 01:46:08.760 align:start position:0%
kpmg's uh audit in fact we we welcome
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
audits to this system and to to all of
 
01:46:13.129 --> 01:46:13.139 align:start position:0%
our DOT activities it helps us know
 
01:46:15.770 --> 01:46:15.780 align:start position:0%
where to focus attention in this case uh
 
01:46:17.330 --> 01:46:17.340 align:start position:0%
there was one finding what we agree with
 
01:46:20.090 --> 01:46:20.100 align:start position:0%
and we're we've taken the the steps
 
01:46:21.350 --> 01:46:21.360 align:start position:0%
necessary to correct that in future
 
01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:25.129 align:start position:0%
necessary to correct that in future
audits

01:46:25.129 --> 01:46:25.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:46:28.129 --> 01:46:28.139 align:start position:0%
can it wasn't clearly understood this
 
01:46:30.410 --> 01:46:30.420 align:start position:0%
gaspi 89 which hasn't been in effect
 
01:46:33.169 --> 01:46:33.179 align:start position:0%
before how does this work this land
 
01:46:35.510 --> 01:46:35.520 align:start position:0%
lease that had to be
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
recorded some different way
 
01:46:39.239 --> 01:46:41.629 align:start position:0%
recorded some different way
s

01:46:41.629 --> 01:46:41.639 align:start position:0%
s
 
01:46:44.689 --> 01:46:44.699 align:start position:0%
yeah so uh for the first time uh these
 
01:46:46.550 --> 01:46:46.560 align:start position:0%
leaves this particular ground lease
 
01:46:49.010 --> 01:46:49.020 align:start position:0%
which is a lessor Arrangement
 
01:46:50.930 --> 01:46:50.940 align:start position:0%
um ultimately had to get recorded as a
 
01:46:53.149 --> 01:46:53.159 align:start position:0%
least receivable and Associated deferred
 
01:46:56.990 --> 01:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
inflow on the face of the balance sheet
 
01:46:59.450 --> 01:46:59.460 align:start position:0%
within the financial statements for the
 
01:47:01.189 --> 01:47:01.199 align:start position:0%
first time whereas previously it was
 
01:47:02.750 --> 01:47:02.760 align:start position:0%
just disclosed in the notes of the
 
01:47:04.189 --> 01:47:04.199 align:start position:0%
financial statements
 
01:47:06.290 --> 01:47:06.300 align:start position:0%
um in the the expenditure associated
 
01:47:08.510 --> 01:47:08.520 align:start position:0%
with you know leases in general are
 
01:47:10.310 --> 01:47:10.320 align:start position:0%
recorded used to be recorded on the on
 
01:47:12.290 --> 01:47:12.300 align:start position:0%
the uh Steve of activities or the
 
01:47:13.669 --> 01:47:13.679 align:start position:0%
statement of revenues and expenses it
 
01:47:15.530 --> 01:47:15.540 align:start position:0%
wasn't as if it had been deleted it was
 
01:47:18.530 --> 01:47:18.540 align:start position:0%
just not put in the right section
 
01:47:21.050 --> 01:47:21.060 align:start position:0%
right essentially it was it wasn't
 
01:47:22.790 --> 01:47:22.800 align:start position:0%
reflected on the face of the statements
 
01:47:25.189 --> 01:47:25.199 align:start position:0%
in accordance with the new prescribed
 
01:47:28.970 --> 01:47:28.980 align:start position:0%
rules under Academy 87.
 
01:47:30.830 --> 01:47:30.840 align:start position:0%
yes it is it was effective for the
 
01:47:33.770 --> 01:47:33.780 align:start position:0%
fiscals no rule after you've been filled
 
01:47:35.270 --> 01:47:35.280 align:start position:0%
out your spreadsheets and said we've
 
01:47:37.790 --> 01:47:37.800 align:start position:0%
changed our mind you did it wrong
 
01:47:41.390 --> 01:47:41.400 align:start position:0%
this is tough I pity you
 
01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:44.219 align:start position:0%
Senator Senator gray for a question
 
01:47:46.310 --> 01:47:46.320 align:start position:0%
um my question is about the uncorrected
 
01:47:49.970 --> 01:47:49.980 align:start position:0%
item okay uh who in your department is
 
01:47:53.149 --> 01:47:53.159 align:start position:0%
doing it uh is it when we are going to
 
01:47:57.350 --> 01:47:57.360 align:start position:0%
correct or seek other remedy and then
 
01:48:00.290 --> 01:48:00.300 align:start position:0%
overall for even administrative services
 
01:48:02.689 --> 01:48:02.699 align:start position:0%
or the LBA
 
01:48:04.970 --> 01:48:04.980 align:start position:0%
um you know who is tracking these
 
01:48:08.330 --> 01:48:08.340 align:start position:0%
Statewide so that we're looking at them
 
01:48:11.209 --> 01:48:11.219 align:start position:0%
before the audits start to see if you
 
01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:14.760 align:start position:0%
know they are have a timeline to correct
 
01:48:17.870 --> 01:48:17.880 align:start position:0%
these things and so I'll let you answer
 
01:48:20.930 --> 01:48:20.940 align:start position:0%
your piece for you for your item and
 
01:48:24.290 --> 01:48:24.300 align:start position:0%
then I'll hopefully get input either at
 
01:48:26.270 --> 01:48:26.280 align:start position:0%
this meeting or at other meetings I know
 
01:48:28.729 --> 01:48:28.739 align:start position:0%
that administrative Services doesn't
 
01:48:31.070 --> 01:48:31.080 align:start position:0%
seem to be paying attention to me so so
 
01:48:33.290 --> 01:48:33.300 align:start position:0%
they may get a surprise at the end of
 
01:48:36.109 --> 01:48:36.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:36.119 --> 01:48:39.790 align:start position:0%
 
oh

01:48:39.790 --> 01:48:39.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:42.350 --> 01:48:42.360 align:start position:0%
so there was a decision made at the
 
01:48:46.310 --> 01:48:46.320 align:start position:0%
Statewide level to not to not uh do this
 
01:48:49.430 --> 01:48:49.440 align:start position:0%
and it's probably something that
 
01:48:52.850 --> 01:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
uh the desk would speak to uh later it's
 
01:48:54.950 --> 01:48:54.960 align:start position:0%
not it's not something that the turnpike
 
01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:56.940 align:start position:0%
system has done or can
 
01:49:04.970 --> 01:49:04.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:07.250 --> 01:49:07.260 align:start position:0%
uh no it didn't answer the question but
 
01:49:10.250 --> 01:49:10.260 align:start position:0%
I I think that administrative Services
 
01:49:12.830 --> 01:49:12.840 align:start position:0%
may want to talk to me afterwards
 
01:49:16.609 --> 01:49:16.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:20.209 --> 01:49:20.219 align:start position:0%
further questions on the turnpike audit
 
01:49:23.390 --> 01:49:23.400 align:start position:0%
system do I did I read in here that your
 
01:49:25.550 --> 01:49:25.560 align:start position:0%
shortest Turnpike the blue star takes in
 
01:49:29.870 --> 01:49:29.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:32.570 --> 01:49:32.580 align:start position:0%
I believe that's true yeah cost the
 
01:49:34.070 --> 01:49:34.080 align:start position:0%
people of Maine to get through New
 
01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:35.149 align:start position:0%
people of Maine to get through New
Hampshire

01:49:35.149 --> 01:49:35.159 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
01:49:37.790 --> 01:49:37.800 align:start position:0%
that's right we don't mind that
 
01:49:39.470 --> 01:49:39.480 align:start position:0%
but they don't pay their share of the
 
01:49:39.480 --> 01:49:42.290 align:start position:0%
but they don't pay their share of the
bridge

01:49:42.290 --> 01:49:42.300 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:44.270 --> 01:49:44.280 align:start position:0%
okay I believe it's been moved and
 
01:49:46.430 --> 01:49:46.440 align:start position:0%
adopted to accept this place on file and
 
01:49:48.709 --> 01:49:48.719 align:start position:0%
release in the usual manner any other
 
01:49:53.689 --> 01:49:53.699 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:57.430 --> 01:49:57.440 align:start position:0%
I sympathize with you on that Gatsby
 
01:49:59.149 --> 01:49:59.159 align:start position:0%
all right
 
01:49:59.159 --> 01:49:59.990 align:start position:0%

my name is Kimberly Bisson we're here
 
01:50:42.050 --> 01:50:42.060 align:start position:0%
today to report the results of our audit
 
01:50:44.030 --> 01:50:44.040 align:start position:0%
of the financial statements contained in
 
01:50:45.470 --> 01:50:45.480 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Lottery's annual
 
01:50:48.109 --> 01:50:48.119 align:start position:0%
comprehensive financial report referred
 
01:50:50.090 --> 01:50:50.100 align:start position:0%
to as the actor for the fiscal year
 
01:50:53.149 --> 01:50:53.159 align:start position:0%
ended June 30th 2022.
 
01:50:54.890 --> 01:50:54.900 align:start position:0%
the financial statements begin on page
 
01:50:57.830 --> 01:50:57.840 align:start position:0%
46 of the report Lottery management is
 
01:50:59.810 --> 01:50:59.820 align:start position:0%
responsible for the preparation and fair
 
01:51:01.490 --> 01:51:01.500 align:start position:0%
presentation of these statements in
 
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:03.000 align:start position:0%
accordance with generally accepted
 
01:51:04.790 --> 01:51:04.800 align:start position:0%
accounting principles
 
01:51:06.950 --> 01:51:06.960 align:start position:0%
our Auditors report an opinion dated
 
01:51:10.609 --> 01:51:10.619 align:start position:0%
December 19 2022 can be Pat excuse me
 
01:51:12.950 --> 01:51:12.960 align:start position:0%
found on pages 27 through 30 in the
 
01:51:15.050 --> 01:51:15.060 align:start position:0%
financial section of the report
 
01:51:17.030 --> 01:51:17.040 align:start position:0%
as noted in the opinion paragraphs on
 
01:51:20.330 --> 01:51:20.340 align:start position:0%
page 27 we issued an unmodified or clean
 
01:51:22.310 --> 01:51:22.320 align:start position:0%
opinion on the Lottery's basic financial
 
01:51:24.890 --> 01:51:24.900 align:start position:0%
statements which also include the notes
 
01:51:28.310 --> 01:51:28.320 align:start position:0%
and other supplementary information
 
01:51:30.290 --> 01:51:30.300 align:start position:0%
while our opinion speaks directly to the
 
01:51:32.570 --> 01:51:32.580 align:start position:0%
basic financial statements and notes no
 
01:51:34.010 --> 01:51:34.020 align:start position:0%
matters came to our attention that
 
01:51:35.270 --> 01:51:35.280 align:start position:0%
caused us to believe that other
 
01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:37.010 align:start position:0%
caused us to believe that other
Financial

01:51:37.010 --> 01:51:37.020 align:start position:0%
Financial
 
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
that other information in the financial
 
01:51:40.729 --> 01:51:40.739 align:start position:0%
section of the report was inconsistent
 
01:51:43.370 --> 01:51:43.380 align:start position:0%
with the basic financial statements
 
01:51:45.410 --> 01:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
auditing standards require we make a
 
01:51:47.450 --> 01:51:47.460 align:start position:0%
number of disclosures to you these
 
01:51:49.129 --> 01:51:49.139 align:start position:0%
disclosures were previously discussed by
 
01:51:51.530 --> 01:51:51.540 align:start position:0%
KPMG and are also included in our
 
01:51:53.750 --> 01:51:53.760 align:start position:0%
required communication handout inserted
 
01:51:55.609 --> 01:51:55.619 align:start position:0%
into your report
 
01:51:57.290 --> 01:51:57.300 align:start position:0%
in the interest of time I will not go
 
01:51:58.550 --> 01:51:58.560 align:start position:0%
through each of them individually
 
01:52:00.109 --> 01:52:00.119 align:start position:0%
however we can say that we were
 
01:52:01.850 --> 01:52:01.860 align:start position:0%
satisfied with the cooperation of the
 
01:52:03.470 --> 01:52:03.480 align:start position:0%
lottery and the progress of the audit
 
01:52:05.030 --> 01:52:05.040 align:start position:0%
and there is nothing we need to bring to
 
01:52:07.370 --> 01:52:07.380 align:start position:0%
the committee's attention related to any
 
01:52:10.250 --> 01:52:10.260 align:start position:0%
concerns with those required disclosures
 
01:52:12.109 --> 01:52:12.119 align:start position:0%
in accordance with government auditing
 
01:52:14.570 --> 01:52:14.580 align:start position:0%
standards we'll be issuing a report on
 
01:52:16.250 --> 01:52:16.260 align:start position:0%
our consideration of the Lottery's
 
01:52:17.750 --> 01:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
internal control over financial
 
01:52:20.030 --> 01:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
reporting and on compliance and other
 
01:52:22.550 --> 01:52:22.560 align:start position:0%
matters as a byproduct of our audit of
 
01:52:24.169 --> 01:52:24.179 align:start position:0%
the financial statements and that report
 
01:52:25.550 --> 01:52:25.560 align:start position:0%
will be included in the management
 
01:52:27.350 --> 01:52:27.360 align:start position:0%
letter which will be presented to this
 
01:52:29.390 --> 01:52:29.400 align:start position:0%
committee at a future meeting
 
01:52:31.609 --> 01:52:31.619 align:start position:0%
this concludes my presentation I'd like
 
01:52:33.590 --> 01:52:33.600 align:start position:0%
to thank Lottery management and staff
 
01:52:35.030 --> 01:52:35.040 align:start position:0%

and with your permission I'll turn the
 
01:52:38.510 --> 01:52:38.520 align:start position:0%
presentation over to director McIntyre
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%

01:52:42.830 --> 01:52:42.840 align:start position:0%

and what you heard earlier from KPMG for
 
01:55:11.689 --> 01:55:11.699 align:start position:0%

auditing standards require that we make
 
01:55:40.669 --> 01:55:40.679 align:start position:0%
a number of disclosures to you which we
 
01:55:42.709 --> 01:55:42.719 align:start position:0%

01:57:07.129 --> 01:57:07.139 align:start position:0%

audited every year are always happy and
 
01:57:12.290 --> 01:57:12.300 align:start position:0%
and cooperative and the ones that every
 
01:57:14.510 --> 01:57:14.520 align:start position:0%
fifth year or so say what's the matter
 
01:57:16.609 --> 01:57:16.619 align:start position:0%
with you you know what are you
 
01:57:19.129 --> 01:57:19.139 align:start position:0%
nitpicking me for you know maybe they
 
01:57:20.689 --> 01:57:20.699 align:start position:0%
maybe we need to audit everybody every
 
01:57:22.990 --> 01:57:23.000 align:start position:0%
year huh
 
01:57:27.410 --> 01:57:27.420 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:31.970 --> 01:57:31.980 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:33.770 --> 01:57:33.780 align:start position:0%
representative leishman
 
01:57:35.629 --> 01:57:35.639 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and thanks for
 
01:57:39.169 --> 01:57:39.179 align:start position:0%
taking my question so I noticed uh on
 
01:57:43.310 --> 01:57:43.320 align:start position:0%
page 46 of the report uh
 
01:57:46.609 --> 01:57:46.619 align:start position:0%
due to other state agencies
 
01:57:48.950 --> 01:57:48.960 align:start position:0%
almost eight million dollars in the
 
01:57:52.370 --> 01:57:52.380 align:start position:0%
previous year was like 623 thousand
 
01:57:55.550 --> 01:57:55.560 align:start position:0%
dollars is there any reason why
 
01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:57.480 align:start position:0%
something is not being given to the
 
01:57:59.450 --> 01:57:59.460 align:start position:0%
other state agencies at this moment or
 
01:58:02.209 --> 01:58:02.219 align:start position:0%
just not get the checks out yet that is
 
01:58:04.910 --> 01:58:04.920 align:start position:0%
due to a timing of cash flow so at the
 
01:58:07.970 --> 01:58:07.980 align:start position:0%
end of the year based on our payables
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
and what we have coming in for cash if
 
01:58:12.770 --> 01:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
we have a negative cash at that time it
 
01:58:14.390 --> 01:58:14.400 align:start position:0%
becomes a due to other state agencies
 
01:58:17.510 --> 01:58:17.520 align:start position:0%
because we're pooled cash with Treasury
 
01:58:19.310 --> 01:58:19.320 align:start position:0%
further questions further questions
 
01:58:22.010 --> 01:58:22.020 align:start position:0%
thanks Mr chairman so I did notice my
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
town of Peterborough the sales were off
 
01:58:26.510 --> 01:58:26.520 align:start position:0%
by a half a million dollars and the
 
01:58:28.370 --> 01:58:28.380 align:start position:0%
largest Liquor Store in Nashua I think
 
01:58:30.470 --> 01:58:30.480 align:start position:0%
was off more than 10 million dollars in
 
01:58:33.410 --> 01:58:33.420 align:start position:0%
your overall revenues are off about 31
 
01:58:35.990 --> 01:58:36.000 align:start position:0%
million dollars can you explain why
 
01:58:39.470 --> 01:58:39.480 align:start position:0%
there's been such a decline in over the
 
01:58:42.470 --> 01:58:42.480 align:start position:0%
last year of people going elsewhere or
 
01:58:44.149 --> 01:58:44.159 align:start position:0%
no I don't think people are going
 
01:58:46.250 --> 01:58:46.260 align:start position:0%
elsewhere represented I think we peaked
 
01:58:48.709 --> 01:58:48.719 align:start position:0%
during the covet uh coat during the
 
01:58:50.629 --> 01:58:50.639 align:start position:0%
covet incident people were staying at
 
01:58:52.729 --> 01:58:52.739 align:start position:0%
home there certainly was a a lot more
 
01:58:55.669 --> 01:58:55.679 align:start position:0%
purchasing going on at our stores and uh
 
01:58:59.750 --> 01:58:59.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:02.930 --> 01:59:02.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:06.310 --> 01:59:06.320 align:start position:0%
further to that if you look at our sales
 
01:59:09.050 --> 01:59:09.060 align:start position:0%
in comparison to pre-covered we still
 
01:59:13.850 --> 01:59:13.860 align:start position:0%
 
01:59:15.950 --> 01:59:15.960 align:start position:0%
back to the pre-year we're right on
 
01:59:15.960 --> 01:59:17.750 align:start position:0%
back to the pre-year we're right on
target

01:59:17.750 --> 01:59:17.760 align:start position:0%

people getting out and about the sales
 
01:59:22.430 --> 01:59:22.440 align:start position:0%
would actually
 
01:59:24.890 --> 01:59:24.900 align:start position:0%

01:59:26.330 --> 01:59:26.340 align:start position:0%

01:59:31.669 --> 01:59:31.679 align:start position:0%
past is this agency is very quick at
 
01:59:34.550 --> 01:59:34.560 align:start position:0%
opening a new place when the when the
 
01:59:37.129 --> 01:59:37.139 align:start position:0%
previous one was showing a decline in
 
01:59:39.410 --> 01:59:39.420 align:start position:0%
sales there a quick react to something
 
01:59:41.629 --> 01:59:41.639 align:start position:0%
if if their sales are falling off
 
01:59:44.750 --> 01:59:44.760 align:start position:0%
they'll open a store elsewhere
 
01:59:47.870 --> 01:59:47.880 align:start position:0%
try to pick up that Revenue but they're
 
01:59:50.629 --> 01:59:50.639 align:start position:0%
