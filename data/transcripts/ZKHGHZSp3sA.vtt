gilmanton
 
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:24.080 align:start position:0%
uh what you see in front of you
 
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:26.960 align:start position:0%
uh and it's easier described on the the
 
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:29.360 align:start position:0%
map that you have provided for the
 
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
people here
 
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:32.720 align:start position:0%
is the senate
 
00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:35.759 align:start position:0%
redistricting plan
 
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:36.960 align:start position:0%
of note
 
00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:39.919 align:start position:0%
uh things that happened is that with the
 
00:07:41.909 --> 00:07:41.919 align:start position:0%
shift of population
 
00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:43.840 align:start position:0%
the northern part of the state
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
decreasing population in the southern
 
00:07:47.909 --> 00:07:47.919 align:start position:0%
portion of the state increasing
 
00:07:47.919 --> 00:07:49.270 align:start position:0%
portion of the state increasing
population

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:49.280 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.309 align:start position:0%
population
and

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:50.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:07:52.790 --> 00:07:52.800 align:start position:0%
that population increase more prevalent
 
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:55.520 align:start position:0%
on the eastern side of the southern part
 
00:07:57.029 --> 00:07:57.039 align:start position:0%
of the state
 
00:07:58.550 --> 00:07:58.560 align:start position:0%
it did require
 
00:08:01.189 --> 00:08:01.199 align:start position:0%
some significant changes in the
 
00:08:03.589 --> 00:08:03.599 align:start position:0%
districts uh to reach
 
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:06.000 align:start position:0%
um that equal population that our
 
00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:08.000 align:start position:0%
constitution talks about and the federal
 
00:08:09.589 --> 00:08:09.599 align:start position:0%
law talks about
 
00:08:13.350 --> 00:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
uh one of those things that
 
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:14.960 align:start position:0%
we looked at
 
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:17.120 align:start position:0%
right off the bat i think i
 
00:08:19.189 --> 00:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
mentioned it in one of the special
 
00:08:20.629 --> 00:08:20.639 align:start position:0%
committee hearings
 
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:22.800 align:start position:0%
of the joint committees between the
 
00:08:24.390 --> 00:08:24.400 align:start position:0%
house and the senate
 
00:08:26.550 --> 00:08:26.560 align:start position:0%
was that manchester
 
00:08:29.909 --> 00:08:29.919 align:start position:0%
uh had almost the perfect population for
 
00:08:32.389 --> 00:08:32.399 align:start position:0%
having just two senate districts
 
00:08:34.949 --> 00:08:34.959 align:start position:0%
uh and that nashua
 
00:08:34.959 --> 00:08:35.750 align:start position:0%
uh and that nashua
uh

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:38.640 align:start position:0%
their population if they remained in
 
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:41.120 align:start position:0%
the number of wards that they had
 
00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:43.599 align:start position:0%
and those awards were distributed out
 
00:08:45.990 --> 00:08:46.000 align:start position:0%
with equal population
 
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:48.640 align:start position:0%
made it very difficult to maintain the
 
00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:50.880 align:start position:0%
system as it is
 
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.040 align:start position:0%
one of the groups that represented
 
00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:56.310 align:start position:0%
one of the groups that represented
they

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
they
 
00:08:58.870 --> 00:08:58.880 align:start position:0%
put forth a
 
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:01.600 align:start position:0%
and the idea that we could
 
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:04.240 align:start position:0%
have a population deviation in nashua
 
00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.269 align:start position:0%
have a population deviation in nashua
between

00:09:05.269 --> 00:09:05.279 align:start position:0%
between
 
00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:09.839 align:start position:0%
uh that and the ideal population of uh
 
00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:12.560 align:start position:0%
eight percent or very close to that
 
00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:13.350 align:start position:0%
eight percent or very close to that
which

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:13.360 align:start position:0%
which
 
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
certainly did not please me much
 
00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.230 align:start position:0%
certainly did not please me much
but

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:18.240 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
again that's what nashua did and they
 
00:09:23.829 --> 00:09:23.839 align:start position:0%
enacted it so the nashua
 
00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:25.269 align:start position:0%
enacted it so the nashua
wards

00:09:25.269 --> 00:09:25.279 align:start position:0%
wards
 
00:09:27.269 --> 00:09:27.279 align:start position:0%
were broken down in the senate districts
 
00:09:30.310 --> 00:09:30.320 align:start position:0%
along those populations
 
00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.350 align:start position:0%
along those populations
i

00:09:31.350 --> 00:09:31.360 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:33.110 align:start position:0%
i
certainly

00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:33.120 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:09:34.870 --> 00:09:34.880 align:start position:0%
think that they could have done better
 
00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:36.480 align:start position:0%
for the population
 
00:09:38.949 --> 00:09:38.959 align:start position:0%
or for the people in new hampshire
 
00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:40.800 align:start position:0%
than they did
 
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:43.440 align:start position:0%
certainly people have asked me what was
 
00:09:45.829 --> 00:09:45.839 align:start position:0%
the criteria how did you make this
 
00:09:48.389 --> 00:09:48.399 align:start position:0%
decision how did you make that decision
 
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760 align:start position:0%
and i'll tell you that and the criteria
 
00:09:54.070 --> 00:09:54.080 align:start position:0%
uh certainly we looked at a whole bunch
 
00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.040 align:start position:0%
of things uh but that when you're trying
 
00:09:58.150 --> 00:09:58.160 align:start position:0%
to do
 
00:09:58.160 --> 00:09:59.030 align:start position:0%
to do
um

00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:02.389 --> 00:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
an equal population uh deviation between
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
the various sens districts
 
00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:08.000 align:start position:0%
and you have that as your your one of
 
00:10:10.470 --> 00:10:10.480 align:start position:0%
your highest principles
 
00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.590 align:start position:0%
your highest principles
that

00:10:11.590 --> 00:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:10:14.630 --> 00:10:14.640 align:start position:0%
it answers some of those questions once
 
00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
you get below that and you say well i
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
have a choice between this community
 
00:10:21.829 --> 00:10:21.839 align:start position:0%
that community looking at population of
 
00:10:24.470 --> 00:10:24.480 align:start position:0%
how you group them together looking at
 
00:10:27.350 --> 00:10:27.360 align:start position:0%
communities of interest types including
 
00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:28.150 align:start position:0%
communities of interest types including
the

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:10:30.310 --> 00:10:30.320 align:start position:0%
former government that they have chosen
 
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:33.440 align:start position:0%
you know sb2 towns uh traditional uh
 
00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:35.839 align:start position:0%
towns uh with the traditional town
 
00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:38.560 align:start position:0%
meetings uh the cities the
 
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:39.590 align:start position:0%
meetings uh the cities the
um

00:10:39.590 --> 00:10:39.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:10:42.069 --> 00:10:42.079 align:start position:0%
the school districts as the uh
 
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:44.560 align:start position:0%
the mapping people had suggested we we
 
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:46.800 align:start position:0%
looked at some of that we looked at a
 
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:49.440 align:start position:0%
lot of different things and because each
 
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.160 align:start position:0%
one of those communities are different
 
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:54.800 align:start position:0%
it was different each time we drew a map
 
00:10:57.190 --> 00:10:57.200 align:start position:0%
and there were a lot of maps that
 
00:10:59.269 --> 00:10:59.279 align:start position:0%
actually got drawn
 
00:11:00.710 --> 00:11:00.720 align:start position:0%
but for
 
00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:02.640 align:start position:0%
various reasons
 
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
we're never publicized we're never put
 
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:05.269 align:start position:0%
we're never publicized we're never put
out

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:05.279 align:start position:0%
out
 
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:07.920 align:start position:0%
uh certainly we took in consideration
 
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:10.880 align:start position:0%
the the testimony of the various people
 
00:11:13.269 --> 00:11:13.279 align:start position:0%
in the towns when you know from the
 
00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:15.920 align:start position:0%
public hearings and i did attend all ten
 
00:11:16.949 --> 00:11:16.959 align:start position:0%
of those
 
00:11:16.959 --> 00:11:17.750 align:start position:0%
of those
uh

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:17.760 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:20.800 align:start position:0%
public hearings uh i may be the only one
 
00:11:22.550 --> 00:11:22.560 align:start position:0%
on both the house and the senate that
 
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:24.880 align:start position:0%
actually made it to all ten uh it was a
 
00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:28.720 align:start position:0%
little difficult uh uh up in uh
 
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:31.440 align:start position:0%
when we were up in um uh conway i think
 
00:11:33.590 --> 00:11:33.600 align:start position:0%
it was uh the uh
 
00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:35.360 align:start position:0%
construction up there on the roads
 
00:11:37.269 --> 00:11:37.279 align:start position:0%
caused a little delay and
 
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:40.720 align:start position:0%
but uh we did make it to all of them uh
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
i'm here for a minute and then i'm gonna
 
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:44.880 align:start position:0%
be across the street so if you have
 
00:11:44.880 --> 00:11:45.910 align:start position:0%
be across the street so if you have
anything

00:11:45.910 --> 00:11:45.920 align:start position:0%
anything
 
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:48.720 align:start position:0%
uh ask me now and i'll be back
 
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:50.880 align:start position:0%
at 10 30 or whenever is appropriate for
 
00:11:53.269 --> 00:11:53.279 align:start position:0%
the for the next hearing
 
00:11:57.269 --> 00:11:57.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:58.790 --> 00:11:58.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you
 
00:12:02.629 --> 00:12:02.639 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question
 
00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:05.040 align:start position:0%
as you know i am from cheshire county
 
00:12:08.389 --> 00:12:08.399 align:start position:0%
and i have a concern because
 
00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:10.480 align:start position:0%
i wonder uh
 
00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:13.360 align:start position:0%
what the rationale was for putting
 
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:15.200 align:start position:0%
cheshire county into four different
 
00:12:17.990 --> 00:12:18.000 align:start position:0%
senatorial districts
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
well again as i said that one of the
 
00:12:23.110 --> 00:12:23.120 align:start position:0%
highest priorities that we had was
 
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:26.320 align:start position:0%
getting that population equal and then
 
00:12:28.310 --> 00:12:28.320 align:start position:0%
as we were able to make that different
 
00:12:31.350 --> 00:12:31.360 align:start position:0%
population in fact um
 
00:12:32.710 --> 00:12:32.720 align:start position:0%
i i
 
00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:34.560 align:start position:0%
the name of the town escapes me one of
 
00:12:36.829 --> 00:12:36.839 align:start position:0%
the last things i did where you see
 
00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
where the interface between uh senate
 
00:12:42.550 --> 00:12:42.560 align:start position:0%
district eight and senate district
 
00:12:46.310 --> 00:12:46.320 align:start position:0%
uh 10 that little elbow-shaped uh town
 
00:12:48.550 --> 00:12:48.560 align:start position:0%
there uh that's one of the last things
 
00:12:51.030 --> 00:12:51.040 align:start position:0%
that i did before i sent the map forward
 
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:53.360 align:start position:0%
and that actually reduced my my
 
00:12:56.470 --> 00:12:56.480 align:start position:0%
population deviation uh
 
00:12:59.030 --> 00:12:59.040 align:start position:0%
by you know several tenths of a percent
 
00:13:00.629 --> 00:13:00.639 align:start position:0%
uh so again
 
00:13:00.639 --> 00:13:01.829 align:start position:0%
uh so again
uh

00:13:01.829 --> 00:13:01.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:03.200 align:start position:0%
you know it
 
00:13:05.430 --> 00:13:05.440 align:start position:0%
people have said well gee the maps are
 
00:13:07.990 --> 00:13:08.000 align:start position:0%
jaggedy and this and that but if you
 
00:13:10.629 --> 00:13:10.639 align:start position:0%
really are trying to get that population
 
00:13:10.639 --> 00:13:12.629 align:start position:0%
really are trying to get that population
correct

00:13:12.629 --> 00:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:16.480 align:start position:0%
in my opinion uh in accordance with um
 
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:18.560 align:start position:0%
part one article nine of the
 
00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:20.240 align:start position:0%
constitution which does talk about
 
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:22.880 align:start position:0%
representative districts but has been
 
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:25.680 align:start position:0%
applied to all of the the redistricting
 
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
we do um we worked hard to get that
 
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.670 align:start position:0%
we do um we worked hard to get that
population

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:29.680 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.190 align:start position:0%
population
um

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:31.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:13:33.910 --> 00:13:33.920 align:start position:0%
to a number that that we could support
 
00:13:36.069 --> 00:13:36.079 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair follow up
 
00:13:39.670 --> 00:13:39.680 align:start position:0%
and of particular concern to me um is
 
00:13:41.509 --> 00:13:41.519 align:start position:0%
senate district nine
 
00:13:43.509 --> 00:13:43.519 align:start position:0%
which you said you you
 
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:46.240 align:start position:0%
uh were concerned with communities of
 
00:13:46.240 --> 00:13:47.350 align:start position:0%
uh were concerned with communities of
interest

00:13:47.350 --> 00:13:47.360 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:50.000 align:start position:0%
i note that senate district 9 runs from
 
00:13:52.710 --> 00:13:52.720 align:start position:0%
hinsdale on the connecticut river
 
00:13:56.629 --> 00:13:56.639 align:start position:0%
which is a small uh town and
 
00:13:58.790 --> 00:13:58.800 align:start position:0%
all the way over to bedford which is a
 
00:14:01.350 --> 00:14:01.360 align:start position:0%
very different large town on the other
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
you know more than halfway across the
 
00:14:03.279 --> 00:14:04.389 align:start position:0%
you know more than halfway across the
state

00:14:04.389 --> 00:14:04.399 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:14:04.399 --> 00:14:06.310 align:start position:0%
state
and

00:14:06.310 --> 00:14:06.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:08.629 align:start position:0%
and
i

00:14:08.629 --> 00:14:08.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:11.750 --> 00:14:11.760 align:start position:0%
wonder why
 
00:14:13.990 --> 00:14:14.000 align:start position:0%
having been intimately involved in doing
 
00:14:16.629 --> 00:14:16.639 align:start position:0%
senatorial maps 10 years ago
 
00:14:19.030 --> 00:14:19.040 align:start position:0%
it's much easier than doing house maps
 
00:14:21.189 --> 00:14:21.199 align:start position:0%
because the deviations are much easier
 
00:14:22.949 --> 00:14:22.959 align:start position:0%
to satisfy
 
00:14:25.269 --> 00:14:25.279 align:start position:0%
and i
 
00:14:27.670 --> 00:14:27.680 align:start position:0%
this this town appears to me to be the
 
00:14:30.389 --> 00:14:30.399 align:start position:0%
very essence of gerrymandering so
 
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:33.440 align:start position:0%
was there no other possible way to have
 
00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:36.160 align:start position:0%
kept communities of interest together
 
00:14:38.710 --> 00:14:38.720 align:start position:0%
there are thousands of ways to keep
 
00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
communities of interest together and
 
00:14:44.069 --> 00:14:44.079 align:start position:0%
thousands of ways to look at this map
 
00:14:46.629 --> 00:14:46.639 align:start position:0%
that the testimony that we heard
 
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.360 align:start position:0%
in sullivan county was gee
 
00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:52.160 align:start position:0%
we have a very close association with
 
00:14:55.350 --> 00:14:55.360 align:start position:0%
the people in vermont we share services
 
00:14:57.670 --> 00:14:57.680 align:start position:0%
we share schools we share a lot of
 
00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.470 align:start position:0%
we share schools we share a lot of
things

00:14:58.470 --> 00:14:58.480 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:00.720 align:start position:0%
across that border the people that we
 
00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:02.880 align:start position:0%
heard down in the southern part of the
 
00:15:06.870 --> 00:15:06.880 align:start position:0%
state said well our economy is very much
 
00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:09.760 align:start position:0%
in tune with the people in massachusetts
 
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:12.240 align:start position:0%
and so that once you go and look at
 
00:15:15.350 --> 00:15:15.360 align:start position:0%
those populations that
 
00:15:17.269 --> 00:15:17.279 align:start position:0%
if i'm not saying communities of
 
00:15:19.990 --> 00:15:20.000 align:start position:0%
interest is the highest thing
 
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
on my list but population is and then i
 
00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:25.920 align:start position:0%
look at those the input that we got from
 
00:15:28.389 --> 00:15:28.399 align:start position:0%
the various communities about who they
 
00:15:31.509 --> 00:15:31.519 align:start position:0%
did want to be associated with and even
 
00:15:35.590 --> 00:15:35.600 align:start position:0%
though we may try to do something
 
00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:38.560 align:start position:0%
i'll tell you i could tear any map that
 
00:15:41.910 --> 00:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
anybody put apart and cast aspersions on
 
00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:44.160 align:start position:0%
it and say it's gerrymandered and say
 
00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.189 align:start position:0%
it and say it's gerrymandered and say
it's

00:15:45.189 --> 00:15:45.199 align:start position:0%
it's
 
00:15:47.509 --> 00:15:47.519 align:start position:0%
this map
 
00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:50.000 align:start position:0%
the population deviation
 
00:15:53.829 --> 00:15:53.839 align:start position:0%
is i believe 7.5 percent
 
00:15:57.509 --> 00:15:57.519 align:start position:0%
a lot of that population deviation is
 
00:16:00.550 --> 00:16:00.560 align:start position:0%
due to the things that were done
 
00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
by the nashua community
 
00:16:06.389 --> 00:16:06.399 align:start position:0%
in the way that they redistricted
 
00:16:10.389 --> 00:16:10.399 align:start position:0%
and are not you really can't change them
 
00:16:12.069 --> 00:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
if you're going to do
 
00:16:14.790 --> 00:16:14.800 align:start position:0%
the five or six different awards in
 
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:16.800 align:start position:0%
nashua to put them together
 
00:16:18.790 --> 00:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
uh you just can't do it
 
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
so there's if we want to sit sit and
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
take pot shots at any particular map
 
00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:27.920 align:start position:0%
you draw a map you let me take pot shots
 
00:16:30.150 --> 00:16:30.160 align:start position:0%
i can do the same thing
 
00:16:31.590 --> 00:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
questions from other members of the
 
00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:34.870 align:start position:0%
questions from other members of the
committee

00:16:34.870 --> 00:16:34.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:37.509 --> 00:16:37.519 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
00:16:39.030 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair thank you senator
 
00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.560 align:start position:0%
for joining us and for taking my
 
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:43.040 align:start position:0%
question uh i'm curious i represent
 
00:16:45.189 --> 00:16:45.199 align:start position:0%
manchester awards one two and three
 
00:16:47.269 --> 00:16:47.279 align:start position:0%
um curious why
 
00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:48.310 align:start position:0%
um curious why
uh

00:16:48.310 --> 00:16:48.320 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:49.519 align:start position:0%
ward one
 
00:16:51.670 --> 00:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
is separated from the the rest of the
 
00:16:53.990 --> 00:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
city well one of the criteria that was
 
00:16:56.550 --> 00:16:56.560 align:start position:0%
used many many years ago
 
00:16:59.910 --> 00:16:59.920 align:start position:0%
when i was probably younger than you
 
00:17:02.710 --> 00:17:02.720 align:start position:0%
was to group
 
00:17:05.429 --> 00:17:05.439 align:start position:0%
communities together such that you had
 
00:17:08.789 --> 00:17:08.799 align:start position:0%
uh one or more sitting senators
 
00:17:10.949 --> 00:17:10.959 align:start position:0%
representatives whatever districts that
 
00:17:14.069 --> 00:17:14.079 align:start position:0%
you were using against each other okay
 
00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280 align:start position:0%
and so we look at manchester and we look
 
00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:18.470 align:start position:0%
and so we look at manchester and we look
at

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
at
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
like goffstown and other communities and
 
00:17:24.949 --> 00:17:24.959 align:start position:0%
that if you take a a
 
00:17:28.309 --> 00:17:28.319 align:start position:0%
a larger portion of manchester and put
 
00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.160 align:start position:0%
it up against one of those other
 
00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:32.230 align:start position:0%
it up against one of those other
communities

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:32.240 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:17:34.150 --> 00:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
they have an undue influence in my
 
00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.590 align:start position:0%
they have an undue influence in my
opinion

00:17:35.590 --> 00:17:35.600 align:start position:0%
opinion
 
00:17:39.029 --> 00:17:39.039 align:start position:0%
on who's going to get elected in that so
 
00:17:41.430 --> 00:17:41.440 align:start position:0%
the original intent was to take and make
 
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:44.480 align:start position:0%
manchester just two senate districts
 
00:17:47.669 --> 00:17:47.679 align:start position:0%
but that would have put uh two
 
00:17:51.029 --> 00:17:51.039 align:start position:0%
of the senators uh uh competing against
 
00:17:53.350 --> 00:17:53.360 align:start position:0%
each other since there are currently uh
 
00:17:55.430 --> 00:17:55.440 align:start position:0%
three democratic senators that live in
 
00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:58.400 align:start position:0%
manchester uh i did not
 
00:18:01.190 --> 00:18:01.200 align:start position:0%
in any other place on that map i did not
 
00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.990 align:start position:0%
in any other place on that map i did not
put

00:18:01.990 --> 00:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
put
 
00:18:03.350 --> 00:18:03.360 align:start position:0%
uh two
 
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:06.960 align:start position:0%
sitting senators uh in opposition with
 
00:18:10.230 --> 00:18:10.240 align:start position:0%
each other unless the senators had
 
00:18:13.029 --> 00:18:13.039 align:start position:0%
expressed to me uh that they
 
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:16.240 align:start position:0%
were looking at a change
 
00:18:18.630 --> 00:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
point in fact is
 
00:18:20.230 --> 00:18:20.240 align:start position:0%
district two
 
00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:23.360 align:start position:0%
the senator from district two said that
 
00:18:27.029 --> 00:18:27.039 align:start position:0%
he was looking at moving further
 
00:18:30.310 --> 00:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
south and east in his district
 
00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:31.760 align:start position:0%
so that
 
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:34.960 align:start position:0%
that allowed us to take district one and
 
00:18:37.909 --> 00:18:37.919 align:start position:0%
come down into the area of the state
 
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:40.240 align:start position:0%
where he currently lives
 
00:18:42.710 --> 00:18:42.720 align:start position:0%
but again that was one of the things
 
00:18:45.029 --> 00:18:45.039 align:start position:0%
that we did not want to do
 
00:18:48.070 --> 00:18:48.080 align:start position:0%
uh unlike some of the other maps that uh
 
00:18:50.549 --> 00:18:50.559 align:start position:0%
that were out there uh that have been
 
00:18:53.830 --> 00:18:53.840 align:start position:0%
proposed by various groups uh that one
 
00:18:56.150 --> 00:18:56.160 align:start position:0%
of them i saw had had three sitting
 
00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.080 align:start position:0%
senators um sitting you know in the same
 
00:19:02.310 --> 00:19:02.320 align:start position:0%
district so you know what are you going
 
00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
to get you're going to
 
00:19:06.150 --> 00:19:06.160 align:start position:0%
are we going to call that gerrymandering
 
00:19:07.909 --> 00:19:07.919 align:start position:0%
or not well
 
00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:09.840 align:start position:0%
again that's one of the things that i
 
00:19:12.950 --> 00:19:12.960 align:start position:0%
tried to avoid in making these maps
 
00:19:14.950 --> 00:19:14.960 align:start position:0%
further questions from committee members
 
00:19:16.710 --> 00:19:16.720 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:19:18.789 --> 00:19:18.799 align:start position:0%
thank you um
 
00:19:18.799 --> 00:19:20.230 align:start position:0%
thank you um
senator

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:20.240 align:start position:0%
senator
 
00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:23.039 align:start position:0%
are you saying that you took incumbents
 
00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:26.080 align:start position:0%
into account over other criteria
 
00:19:26.080 --> 00:19:28.470 align:start position:0%
into account over other criteria
absolutely

00:19:28.470 --> 00:19:28.480 align:start position:0%
absolutely
 
00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:30.080 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair
 
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:31.270 align:start position:0%
follow up madam chair
certainly

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:31.280 align:start position:0%
certainly
 
00:19:34.310 --> 00:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
um can you comment on why that is not
 
00:19:36.070 --> 00:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
seem to be a problem in the
 
00:19:38.470 --> 00:19:38.480 align:start position:0%
congressional maps that have been drawn
 
00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:41.200 align:start position:0%
and recommended by the governor there is
 
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:44.400 align:start position:0%
differences in the eligibility
 
00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:47.280 align:start position:0%
for state offices where you have to live
 
00:19:50.710 --> 00:19:50.720 align:start position:0%
in your district and federal offices for
 
00:19:53.270 --> 00:19:53.280 align:start position:0%
especially congressional districts
 
00:19:55.029 --> 00:19:55.039 align:start position:0%
but we're not here to talk about the
 
00:19:56.870 --> 00:19:56.880 align:start position:0%
congressional districts but you do not
 
00:19:59.909 --> 00:19:59.919 align:start position:0%
need to actually live in a congressional
 
00:20:02.870 --> 00:20:02.880 align:start position:0%
district to run in that district case in
 
00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:04.230 align:start position:0%
district to run in that district case in
point

00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
point
 
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:05.110 align:start position:0%
point
was

00:20:05.110 --> 00:20:05.120 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:20:07.029 --> 00:20:07.039 align:start position:0%
mr sanders who ran
 
00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:09.280 align:start position:0%
uh two years ago
 
00:20:13.350 --> 00:20:13.360 align:start position:0%
in a district that he did not live in
 
00:20:18.149 --> 00:20:18.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:19.430 --> 00:20:19.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none
 
00:20:22.470 --> 00:20:22.480 align:start position:0%
um i'm going to open the floor to
 
00:20:26.549 --> 00:20:26.559 align:start position:0%
comment on sb 240. um senator gray
 
00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:28.640 align:start position:0%
it has other things to do senator gray
 
00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:31.760 align:start position:0%
if you can stay here until 10 30 um the
 
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
people who have signed up to speak on
 
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:35.600 align:start position:0%
240 have also signed up to speak on 241
 
00:20:37.190 --> 00:20:37.200 align:start position:0%
so my preference would be to start to
 
00:20:39.669 --> 00:20:39.679 align:start position:0%
take public testimony now for 10 minutes
 
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:41.520 align:start position:0%
and if you can stay then break in the
 
00:20:44.390 --> 00:20:44.400 align:start position:0%
public testimony go into
 
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:46.720 align:start position:0%
your second bill before us at 2
 
00:20:49.830 --> 00:20:49.840 align:start position:0%
241 as noticed and then after you
 
00:20:51.270 --> 00:20:51.280 align:start position:0%
present that bill
 
00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:53.280 align:start position:0%
we can let you take care of the rest of
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
your day and we can continue to hear
 
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:57.200 align:start position:0%
testimony on both bills as you wish
 
00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:00.320 align:start position:0%

open democracy action we're a
 
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan nonprofit organization which
 
00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:36.080 align:start position:0%

00:21:38.549 --> 00:21:38.559 align:start position:0%
and we work on democracy and i live in
 
00:21:38.559 --> 00:21:39.750 align:start position:0%
and we work on democracy and i live in
franklin

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:39.760 align:start position:0%
franklin
 
00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:41.360 align:start position:0%
and i'm a mother of a 12 year old
 
00:21:43.750 --> 00:21:43.760 align:start position:0%
daughter and my 12 year old daughter
 
00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:45.200 align:start position:0%
will be voting
 
00:21:46.630 --> 00:21:46.640 align:start position:0%
in six years
 
00:21:48.549 --> 00:21:48.559 align:start position:0%
and these maps will be the things that
 
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:51.520 align:start position:0%
she she gets to inherit
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
as a first-time voter um so the the you
 
00:21:56.870 --> 00:21:56.880 align:start position:0%
know just a reminder that these maps are
 
00:21:58.710 --> 00:21:58.720 align:start position:0%
for 10 years
 
00:21:58.720 --> 00:21:59.510 align:start position:0%
for 10 years
i

00:21:59.510 --> 00:21:59.520 align:start position:0%
i
 
00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:01.280 align:start position:0%
thank you for the opportunity to to
 
00:22:03.990 --> 00:22:04.000 align:start position:0%
oppose senate bill 240.
 
00:22:06.310 --> 00:22:06.320 align:start position:0%
um i think that this bill
 
00:22:08.789 --> 00:22:08.799 align:start position:0%
doesn't take into consideration what's
 
00:22:10.950 --> 00:22:10.960 align:start position:0%
best for the majority of voters in new
 
00:22:12.390 --> 00:22:12.400 align:start position:0%
hampshire which are the undeclared
 
00:22:15.750 --> 00:22:15.760 align:start position:0%
voters and public criteria
 
00:22:17.750 --> 00:22:17.760 align:start position:0%
is very important
 
00:22:20.630 --> 00:22:20.640 align:start position:0%
these maps have sprawling districts
 
00:22:22.549 --> 00:22:22.559 align:start position:0%
which are not compact
 
00:22:24.789 --> 00:22:24.799 align:start position:0%
this increases the margin to win
 
00:22:28.710 --> 00:22:28.720 align:start position:0%
republicans can win 15 almost 16 of
 
00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:29.830 align:start position:0%
republicans can win 15 almost 16 of
these

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
00:22:31.750 --> 00:22:31.760 align:start position:0%
senate districts
 
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:34.720 align:start position:0%
are lean republican which locks in a
 
00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.630 align:start position:0%
are lean republican which locks in a
supermajority

00:22:36.630 --> 00:22:36.640 align:start position:0%
supermajority
 
00:22:38.549 --> 00:22:38.559 align:start position:0%
for republicans
 
00:22:41.190 --> 00:22:41.200 align:start position:0%
this ignores communities of interest
 
00:22:44.390 --> 00:22:44.400 align:start position:0%
like regional high schools and splits 35
 
00:22:47.029 --> 00:22:47.039 align:start position:0%
high school saus
 
00:22:50.310 --> 00:22:50.320 align:start position:0%
this packs districts with voters
 
00:22:52.830 --> 00:22:52.840 align:start position:0%
both in the minority and majority
 
00:22:55.750 --> 00:22:55.760 align:start position:0%
parties it puts college towns like
 
00:22:58.310 --> 00:22:58.320 align:start position:0%
lebanon and hanover and plymouth into
 
00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:00.080 align:start position:0%
senate district 5
 
00:23:02.470 --> 00:23:02.480 align:start position:0%
leaving those adjacent districts more
 
00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:05.270 align:start position:0%
leaving those adjacent districts more
conservative

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:05.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:07.840 align:start position:0%
um it has a somewhat
 
00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
high deviation
 
00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:11.029 align:start position:0%
high deviation
um

00:23:11.029 --> 00:23:11.039 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:23:13.029 --> 00:23:13.039 align:start position:0%
and i think most of this is actually
 
00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:14.720 align:start position:0%
contributed to the
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
national award lines splitting
 
00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:19.039 align:start position:0%
manchester into three districts where it
 
00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240 align:start position:0%
could be
 
00:23:23.750 --> 00:23:23.760 align:start position:0%
evenly split into two districts
 
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:26.960 align:start position:0%
there are only three competitive
 
00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:29.600 align:start position:0%
senate district and zero very
 
00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:31.280 align:start position:0%
competitive district
 
00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:32.960 align:start position:0%
i want to speak to the senate district
 
00:23:34.950 --> 00:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
that i live in
 
00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:36.960 align:start position:0%
it puts the city of franklin in a
 
00:23:39.430 --> 00:23:39.440 align:start position:0%
district that goes to orange which is uh
 
00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:41.200 align:start position:0%
in the upper valley most of the people
 
00:23:43.909 --> 00:23:43.919 align:start position:0%
in orange go shopping in lebanon
 
00:23:46.390 --> 00:23:46.400 align:start position:0%
and it goes down to hillsboro
 
00:23:47.669 --> 00:23:47.679 align:start position:0%
and so
 
00:23:51.190 --> 00:23:51.200 align:start position:0%
i would say that most of the triangle
 
00:23:52.870 --> 00:23:52.880 align:start position:0%
that represents franklin orange and
 
00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.070 align:start position:0%
that represents franklin orange and
hillsborough

00:23:54.070 --> 00:23:54.080 align:start position:0%
hillsborough
 
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:56.640 align:start position:0%
don't have a lot in common
 
00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:00.320 align:start position:0%
um and you also can't get there from
 
00:24:02.549 --> 00:24:02.559 align:start position:0%
one town to another unless you like hike
 
00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:04.960 align:start position:0%
over mount cardigan
 
00:24:07.909 --> 00:24:07.919 align:start position:0%
which is one way to get to orange
 
00:24:09.510 --> 00:24:09.520 align:start position:0%
but the roads don't really take you
 
00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.190 align:start position:0%
but the roads don't really take you
there

00:24:11.190 --> 00:24:11.200 align:start position:0%
there
 
00:24:12.870 --> 00:24:12.880 align:start position:0%
and then i wanted to speak to senate
 
00:24:14.470 --> 00:24:14.480 align:start position:0%
district 9
 
00:24:17.269 --> 00:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
which is a lean republican
 
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
district which stretches now from the
 
00:24:22.230 --> 00:24:22.240 align:start position:0%
vermont border to hinsdale all the way
 
00:24:26.390 --> 00:24:26.400 align:start position:0%
to bedford and it's one town deep
 
00:24:27.990 --> 00:24:28.000 align:start position:0%
and i just want to point out that i
 
00:24:30.390 --> 00:24:30.400 align:start position:0%
don't think hinsdale and bedford have a
 
00:24:33.190 --> 00:24:33.200 align:start position:0%
lot in common as far as communities of
 
00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.549 align:start position:0%
lot in common as far as communities of
interest

00:24:34.549 --> 00:24:34.559 align:start position:0%
interest
 
00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:36.880 align:start position:0%
i really want to urge this committee to
 
00:24:38.789 --> 00:24:38.799 align:start position:0%
work towards a solution that works for
 
00:24:40.390 --> 00:24:40.400 align:start position:0%
both parties
 
00:24:43.029 --> 00:24:43.039 align:start position:0%
that if 50 of the voters vote republican
 
00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:44.720 align:start position:0%
and 50 percent of the voters vote
 
00:24:48.390 --> 00:24:48.400 align:start position:0%
democrat that we could get a map that
 
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:50.960 align:start position:0%
works for both parties instead of
 
00:24:53.909 --> 00:24:53.919 align:start position:0%
one party getting 16 seats and the other
 
00:24:56.789 --> 00:24:56.799 align:start position:0%
party getting eight seats
 
00:24:58.149 --> 00:24:58.159 align:start position:0%
and with that i'm happy to take
 
00:25:00.149 --> 00:25:00.159 align:start position:0%
questions and i have copies of my
 
00:25:02.230 --> 00:25:02.240 align:start position:0%
written testimony that i can hand around
 
00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:04.320 align:start position:0%
great thank you if you can just pass why
 
00:25:05.110 --> 00:25:05.120 align:start position:0%
don't you just give that to
 
00:25:06.950 --> 00:25:06.960 align:start position:0%
representative roulard and we'll get it
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
passed around questions from committee
 
00:25:09.039 --> 00:25:13.350 align:start position:0%
passed around questions from committee
members

00:25:13.350 --> 00:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:17.909 --> 00:25:17.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:19.669 --> 00:25:19.679 align:start position:0%
did you
 
00:25:23.269 --> 00:25:23.279 align:start position:0%
propose a senate map open democracy to
 
00:25:25.110 --> 00:25:25.120 align:start position:0%
the senate in the same way that you did
 
00:25:27.269 --> 00:25:27.279 align:start position:0%
to us here in the house
 
00:25:30.070 --> 00:25:30.080 align:start position:0%
yes the mapathon team has proposed maps
 
00:25:32.149 --> 00:25:32.159 align:start position:0%
um david andrews who's our lead mapper
 
00:25:33.510 --> 00:25:33.520 align:start position:0%
is here today and can speak to the
 
00:25:36.070 --> 00:25:36.080 align:start position:0%
mapathon proposals and we'll have copies
 
00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:39.600 align:start position:0%
of all of that analysis for you as well
 
00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:40.789 align:start position:0%
of all of that analysis for you as well
further

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:40.799 align:start position:0%
further
 
00:25:43.909 --> 00:25:43.919 align:start position:0%
um is the deviation um significantly
 
00:25:46.549 --> 00:25:46.559 align:start position:0%
greater in the open democracy map than
 
00:25:47.909 --> 00:25:47.919 align:start position:0%
it was
 
00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:49.760 align:start position:0%
mr andrews has signed up to speak right
 
00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000 align:start position:0%
oh yeah okay thank you
 
00:25:54.470 --> 00:25:54.480 align:start position:0%
i'll pepper him okay thank you
 
00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:56.320 align:start position:0%
he's much better at answering deviation
 
00:25:58.070 --> 00:25:58.080 align:start position:0%
questions than i am
 
00:26:00.390 --> 00:26:00.400 align:start position:0%
much better at the math
 
00:26:01.510 --> 00:26:01.520 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:26:03.269 --> 00:26:03.279 align:start position:0%
further questions
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
00:26:07.269 --> 00:26:07.279 align:start position:0%
and welcome back to election thank you
 
00:26:09.110 --> 00:26:09.120 align:start position:0%
thank you so much
 
00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:10.480 align:start position:0%
i don't even know what committee i'm in
 
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.590 align:start position:0%
i don't even know what committee i'm in
anymore

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:11.600 align:start position:0%
anymore
 
00:26:13.190 --> 00:26:13.200 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and thank you
 
00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:14.720 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
00:26:17.669 --> 00:26:17.679 align:start position:0%
uh you've testified um
 
00:26:20.070 --> 00:26:20.080 align:start position:0%
given some examples around uh how
 
00:26:21.669 --> 00:26:21.679 align:start position:0%
community of interests
 
00:26:24.310 --> 00:26:24.320 align:start position:0%
uh concerns or have not been adequately
 
00:26:26.310 --> 00:26:26.320 align:start position:0%
addressed in some of the sections i
 
00:26:28.630 --> 00:26:28.640 align:start position:0%
wonder if you could say anything about
 
00:26:31.990 --> 00:26:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:34.470 --> 00:26:34.480 align:start position:0%
the overall fairness indifference to
 
00:26:35.909 --> 00:26:35.919 align:start position:0%
other maps that have been presented to
 
00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:38.640 align:start position:0%
the committee for consideration
 
00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:41.200 align:start position:0%
for the voters you did allude to
 
00:26:44.549 --> 00:26:44.559 align:start position:0%
how independent voters might be
 
00:26:47.190 --> 00:26:47.200 align:start position:0%
not served as well by this map could you
 
00:26:48.630 --> 00:26:48.640 align:start position:0%
say a little more about that so we can
 
00:26:50.310 --> 00:26:50.320 align:start position:0%
understand it
 
00:26:50.320 --> 00:26:51.110 align:start position:0%
understand it
um

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:51.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:53.360 align:start position:0%
yeah i'll try to attack that question i
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
think new hampshire is a very purple
 
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.470 align:start position:0%
think new hampshire is a very purple
state

00:26:56.470 --> 00:26:56.480 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:26:58.230 --> 00:26:58.240 align:start position:0%
where the majority of voters are
 
00:27:01.029 --> 00:27:01.039 align:start position:0%
undeclared voters and we know undeclared
 
00:27:04.549 --> 00:27:04.559 align:start position:0%
voters can swing elect elections and
 
00:27:06.870 --> 00:27:06.880 align:start position:0%
when you do analysis of maps you can
 
00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
look at different years of elections
 
00:27:10.470 --> 00:27:10.480 align:start position:0%
based on
 
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:13.120 align:start position:0%
you know what what swings different
 
00:27:14.630 --> 00:27:14.640 align:start position:0%
voters and so
 
00:27:17.190 --> 00:27:17.200 align:start position:0%
um i think the district urine has swung
 
00:27:19.110 --> 00:27:19.120 align:start position:0%
has been mostly republican for the last
 
00:27:21.430 --> 00:27:21.440 align:start position:0%
10 years but has swing swung democrat at
 
00:27:24.070 --> 00:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
least once if the senate district and i
 
00:27:25.909 --> 00:27:25.919 align:start position:0%
believe that senate district is very
 
00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:27.430 align:start position:0%
believe that senate district is very
similar

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:27.440 align:start position:0%
similar
 
00:27:27.440 --> 00:27:28.630 align:start position:0%
similar
um

00:27:28.630 --> 00:27:28.640 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:27:31.269 --> 00:27:31.279 align:start position:0%
this decade this proposal decade as it
 
00:27:33.909 --> 00:27:33.919 align:start position:0%
was the the prior decade
 
00:27:36.310 --> 00:27:36.320 align:start position:0%
and i think that when we look at maps we
 
00:27:40.789 --> 00:27:40.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:42.720 align:start position:0%
say i'm going to the polls because i
 
00:27:44.710 --> 00:27:44.720 align:start position:0%
feel like my vote matters
 
00:27:47.590 --> 00:27:47.600 align:start position:0%
not i'm doesn't matter which candidate i
 
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:48.960 align:start position:0%
choose for senate because there's
 
00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:51.279 align:start position:0%
already a preordained outcome
 
00:27:53.269 --> 00:27:53.279 align:start position:0%
and it's really important that there's
 
00:27:55.909 --> 00:27:55.919 align:start position:0%
faith and integrity in the process
 
00:27:58.070 --> 00:27:58.080 align:start position:0%
and i believe that in some of these
 
00:28:00.149 --> 00:28:00.159 align:start position:0%
senate districts some voters might look
 
00:28:02.789 --> 00:28:02.799 align:start position:0%
at the map and say i don't believe my
 
00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:05.520 align:start position:0%
vote matters whether i'm a republican
 
00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:07.840 align:start position:0%
in lebanon and i'd say it doesn't matter
 
00:28:09.510 --> 00:28:09.520 align:start position:0%
who i vote for as a republican in
 
00:28:11.510 --> 00:28:11.520 align:start position:0%
lebanon because the republican candidate
 
00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:13.520 align:start position:0%
in lebanon has no chance of winning that
 
00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:16.480 align:start position:0%
district with new london and
 
00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:17.190 align:start position:0%
district with new london and
and

00:28:17.190 --> 00:28:17.200 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:28:19.269 --> 00:28:19.279 align:start position:0%
plymouth and lebanon
 
00:28:21.669 --> 00:28:21.679 align:start position:0%
and dartmouth's packed into that
 
00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:24.480 align:start position:0%
district whereas a district
 
00:28:26.630 --> 00:28:26.640 align:start position:0%
somebody a democratic voter in a
 
00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:29.039 align:start position:0%
different district might feel like their
 
00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:30.799 align:start position:0%
vote for a senate candidate might not
 
00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:33.430 align:start position:0%
vote for a senate candidate might not
matter

00:28:33.430 --> 00:28:33.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.549 align:start position:0%
 
follow-up

00:28:34.549 --> 00:28:34.559 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:37.200 align:start position:0%
it's it's the question of a novice since
 
00:28:38.710 --> 00:28:38.720 align:start position:0%
i did not serve on the redistricting
 
00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee but
 
00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:42.880 align:start position:0%
my question is whether or not the
 
00:28:46.310 --> 00:28:46.320 align:start position:0%
um the calculus of uh competitiveness is
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
even one of the criterium that's used
 
00:28:52.789 --> 00:28:52.799 align:start position:0%
my understanding is there's been no
 
00:28:55.830 --> 00:28:55.840 align:start position:0%
criteria that's been publicly released
 
00:28:57.830 --> 00:28:57.840 align:start position:0%
and i do think that next decade it would
 
00:28:59.269 --> 00:28:59.279 align:start position:0%
be really helpful to have public
 
00:29:02.149 --> 00:29:02.159 align:start position:0%
criteria released on how this these
 
00:29:04.549 --> 00:29:04.559 align:start position:0%
maps are drawn senator gray talked about
 
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:06.720 align:start position:0%
some of the criteria he used as far as
 
00:29:08.389 --> 00:29:08.399 align:start position:0%
protecting incumbents is one of those
 
00:29:10.549 --> 00:29:10.559 align:start position:0%
criterias but i think
 
00:29:14.549 --> 00:29:14.559 align:start position:0%
i did not see a list of public criteria
 
00:29:17.750 --> 00:29:17.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:19.350 --> 00:29:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
00:29:22.389 --> 00:29:22.399 align:start position:0%
being here today and taking my question
 
00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that
 
00:29:28.710 --> 00:29:28.720 align:start position:0%
my constituents in hinsdale which is the
 
00:29:31.269 --> 00:29:31.279 align:start position:0%
farthest town to the southwest in our
 
00:29:31.279 --> 00:29:32.549 align:start position:0%
farthest town to the southwest in our
state

00:29:32.549 --> 00:29:32.559 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:33.840 align:start position:0%
might be
 
00:29:36.870 --> 00:29:36.880 align:start position:0%
considerably aggrieved at a district
 
00:29:38.789 --> 00:29:38.799 align:start position:0%
which joins them to a very large
 
00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:41.360 align:start position:0%
population center which is almost in
 
00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.029 align:start position:0%
population center which is almost in
nashua

00:29:43.029 --> 00:29:43.039 align:start position:0%
nashua
 
00:29:43.039 --> 00:29:43.990 align:start position:0%
nashua
and

00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:44.000 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:29:46.070 --> 00:29:46.080 align:start position:0%
that they might feel
 
00:29:48.310 --> 00:29:48.320 align:start position:0%
that no matter who wins this district
 
00:29:49.909 --> 00:29:49.919 align:start position:0%
although we know who's going to win this
 
00:29:49.919 --> 00:29:51.990 align:start position:0%
although we know who's going to win this
district

00:29:51.990 --> 00:29:52.000 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:29:55.029 --> 00:29:55.039 align:start position:0%
that they might not be well served by a
 
00:29:57.590 --> 00:29:57.600 align:start position:0%
senator who is not as they are now from
 
00:29:59.190 --> 00:29:59.200 align:start position:0%
cheshire county
 
00:30:01.909 --> 00:30:01.919 align:start position:0%
but from somewhere all the way over near
 
00:30:06.630 --> 00:30:06.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:08.950 --> 00:30:08.960 align:start position:0%
yes i do agree that voters in hinsdale
 
00:30:10.230 --> 00:30:10.240 align:start position:0%
might feel
 
00:30:11.750 --> 00:30:11.760 align:start position:0%
that a senator
 
00:30:13.510 --> 00:30:13.520 align:start position:0%
would not rep i would hope that a
 
00:30:15.750 --> 00:30:15.760 align:start position:0%
senator would feel like they represent
 
00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:17.760 align:start position:0%
every town in their district
 
00:30:20.549 --> 00:30:20.559 align:start position:0%
um but i could see that it easily that a
 
00:30:22.470 --> 00:30:22.480 align:start position:0%
senator could focus their attention on
 
00:30:24.389 --> 00:30:24.399 align:start position:0%
those bedford towns
 
00:30:26.549 --> 00:30:26.559 align:start position:0%
um and not make it all the way across
 
00:30:29.430 --> 00:30:29.440 align:start position:0%
the state i think that it's also the
 
00:30:31.110 --> 00:30:31.120 align:start position:0%
roads don't go
 
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:33.760 align:start position:0%
exactly like 101 does not travel exactly
 
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:35.200 align:start position:0%
that route to get
 
00:30:37.510 --> 00:30:37.520 align:start position:0%
from hinsdale
 
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:39.520 align:start position:0%
it's a little tricky further questions
 
00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:42.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:44.789 --> 00:30:44.799 align:start position:0%
that question was pretty speculative i
 
00:30:46.230 --> 00:30:46.240 align:start position:0%
allowed it but
 
00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:47.760 align:start position:0%
i'm going to ask committee members to
 
00:30:50.470 --> 00:30:50.480 align:start position:0%
try to ask questions that people would
 
00:30:53.190 --> 00:30:53.200 align:start position:0%
actually have a basis for responding
 
00:30:56.389 --> 00:30:56.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:57.750 --> 00:30:57.760 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:31:02.710 --> 00:31:02.720 align:start position:0%
um it is it is now 10 30. i'm going to
 
00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:05.600 align:start position:0%
put the public hearing on 2 40 into
 
00:31:08.230 --> 00:31:08.240 align:start position:0%
recess and i'm going to recognize
 
00:31:11.509 --> 00:31:11.519 align:start position:0%
senator gray to introduce 241 to the
 
00:31:12.950 --> 00:31:12.960 align:start position:0%
committee welcome
 
00:31:16.230 --> 00:31:16.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:19.190 --> 00:31:19.200 align:start position:0%
thank you very much uh for the record i
 
00:31:21.509 --> 00:31:21.519 align:start position:0%
am james gray i represent senate
 
00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:24.080 align:start position:0%
district six which starts in rochester
 
00:31:27.509 --> 00:31:27.519 align:start position:0%
goes up route 11 into uh belknap county
 
00:31:30.830 --> 00:31:30.840 align:start position:0%
uh alton barnes said in gilman
 
00:31:33.110 --> 00:31:33.120 align:start position:0%
uh certainly
 
00:31:35.509 --> 00:31:35.519 align:start position:0%
one of the things that we heard from the
 
00:31:36.950 --> 00:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
public hearings
 
00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:37.909 align:start position:0%
public hearings
was

00:31:37.909 --> 00:31:37.919 align:start position:0%
was
 
00:31:40.630 --> 00:31:40.640 align:start position:0%
how gerrymandered and i'll use quotes
 
00:31:41.909 --> 00:31:41.919 align:start position:0%
around that
 
00:31:43.509 --> 00:31:43.519 align:start position:0%
uh the
 
00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:47.440 align:start position:0%
executive council district sure
 
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:49.840 align:start position:0%
again if you are really trying to do
 
00:31:52.870 --> 00:31:52.880 align:start position:0%
what the law
 
00:31:55.750 --> 00:31:55.760 align:start position:0%
says and get the populations as equal as
 
00:31:55.760 --> 00:31:57.350 align:start position:0%
says and get the populations as equal as
possible

00:31:57.350 --> 00:31:57.360 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:32:01.269 --> 00:32:01.279 align:start position:0%
sometimes the maps get messy sometimes
 
00:32:02.470 --> 00:32:02.480 align:start position:0%
you end up
 
00:32:05.669 --> 00:32:05.679 align:start position:0%
with things that stretch out
 
00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:07.440 align:start position:0%
so one of the things that we did try to
 
00:32:09.990 --> 00:32:10.000 align:start position:0%
do is to take a good look at that
 
00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:12.720 align:start position:0%
the population deviation i believe for
 
00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:15.600 align:start position:0%
the map without any changes using the
 
00:32:17.350 --> 00:32:17.360 align:start position:0%
new census data
 
00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:20.870 align:start position:0%
was approximately 2.7
 
00:32:20.870 --> 00:32:22.310 align:start position:0%
was approximately 2.7
[Music]

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:32:24.149 --> 00:32:24.159 align:start position:0%
we looked at
 
00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:26.240 align:start position:0%
several different maps
 
00:32:28.389 --> 00:32:28.399 align:start position:0%
how that could be
 
00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:31.200 align:start position:0%
uh accomplished um
 
00:32:31.200 --> 00:32:32.310 align:start position:0%
uh accomplished um
and

00:32:32.310 --> 00:32:32.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:33.430 align:start position:0%
and
again

00:32:33.430 --> 00:32:33.440 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:32:36.630 --> 00:32:36.640 align:start position:0%
uh not trying to protect
 
00:32:38.470 --> 00:32:38.480 align:start position:0%
any incumbent
 
00:32:40.830 --> 00:32:40.840 align:start position:0%
but to make sure that we didn't
 
00:32:43.190 --> 00:32:43.200 align:start position:0%
intentionally have
 
00:32:45.590 --> 00:32:45.600 align:start position:0%
two incumbents running against each
 
00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.110 align:start position:0%
two incumbents running against each
other

00:32:47.110 --> 00:32:47.120 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:32:49.350 --> 00:32:49.360 align:start position:0%
which is one of the criteria in your
 
00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:51.200 align:start position:0%
ncls book
 
00:32:54.149 --> 00:32:54.159 align:start position:0%
that you i think all got on election you
 
00:32:56.630 --> 00:32:56.640 align:start position:0%
go into the chart on the back in the
 
00:32:59.310 --> 00:32:59.320 align:start position:0%
various states that have criteria for
 
00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.950 align:start position:0%
various states that have criteria for
redistricting

00:33:00.950 --> 00:33:00.960 align:start position:0%
redistricting
 
00:33:04.549 --> 00:33:04.559 align:start position:0%
is one of the ones that's listed there
 
00:33:06.870 --> 00:33:06.880 align:start position:0%
it's not gerrymandering it's
 
00:33:09.029 --> 00:33:09.039 align:start position:0%
what i consider to be the opposite of
 
00:33:12.549 --> 00:33:12.559 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering it is making sure
 
00:33:12.559 --> 00:33:13.509 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering it is making sure
that

00:33:13.509 --> 00:33:13.519 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:33:15.669 --> 00:33:15.679 align:start position:0%
someone doesn't decide well
 
00:33:17.430 --> 00:33:17.440 align:start position:0%
you know this one and this one we're
 
00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:18.720 align:start position:0%
gonna we're gonna have these two
 
00:33:21.190 --> 00:33:21.200 align:start position:0%
democrats run off against each other
 
00:33:23.110 --> 00:33:23.120 align:start position:0%
uh that's certainly not
 
00:33:26.470 --> 00:33:26.480 align:start position:0%
not the intent of what i did and it is
 
00:33:28.470 --> 00:33:28.480 align:start position:0%
the opposite we tried to make sure that
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
that didn't happen
 
00:33:33.669 --> 00:33:33.679 align:start position:0%
um but sometimes things get messy
 
00:33:35.590 --> 00:33:35.600 align:start position:0%
so the resulting map that you sit in
 
00:33:38.389 --> 00:33:38.399 align:start position:0%
front uh see in front of you
 
00:33:40.870 --> 00:33:40.880 align:start position:0%
there was a lot of people that wanted
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
this wanted that one of the other things
 
00:33:46.230 --> 00:33:46.240 align:start position:0%
i need to be able to count to 13 in the
 
00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.350 align:start position:0%
i need to be able to count to 13 in the
senate

00:33:47.350 --> 00:33:47.360 align:start position:0%
senate
 
00:33:49.190 --> 00:33:49.200 align:start position:0%
to get things passed
 
00:33:54.230 --> 00:33:54.240 align:start position:0%
and it took a long time unfortunately
 
00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.669 align:start position:0%
and it took a long time unfortunately
the

00:33:55.669 --> 00:33:55.679 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:33:58.950 --> 00:33:58.960 align:start position:0%
map that you see in front of you was not
 
00:34:01.269 --> 00:34:01.279 align:start position:0%
put together in time to have a separate
 
00:34:02.789 --> 00:34:02.799 align:start position:0%
public hearing
 
00:34:04.149 --> 00:34:04.159 align:start position:0%
in the senate
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
but it does a lot of the things that we
 
00:34:07.830 --> 00:34:07.840 align:start position:0%
were told
 
00:34:10.310 --> 00:34:10.320 align:start position:0%
in both the hearings that we held across
 
00:34:12.230 --> 00:34:12.240 align:start position:0%
the state and each one of the counties
 
00:34:14.310 --> 00:34:14.320 align:start position:0%
and what we heard in the other public
 
00:34:16.069 --> 00:34:16.079 align:start position:0%
hearings that was held
 
00:34:17.990 --> 00:34:18.000 align:start position:0%
on the map
 
00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:19.430 align:start position:0%
on the map
that

00:34:19.430 --> 00:34:19.440 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:34:21.510 --> 00:34:21.520 align:start position:0%
is currently invoked on those
 
00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.869 align:start position:0%
is currently invoked on those
communities

00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:22.879 align:start position:0%
communities
 
00:34:24.230 --> 00:34:24.240 align:start position:0%
this shifts
 
00:34:26.710 --> 00:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
some of the population down into the
 
00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:28.320 align:start position:0%
area where
 
00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.349 align:start position:0%
area where
the

00:34:29.349 --> 00:34:29.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:31.760 align:start position:0%
line of population
 
00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.829 align:start position:0%
line of population
has

00:34:32.829 --> 00:34:32.839 align:start position:0%
has
 
00:34:35.909 --> 00:34:35.919 align:start position:0%
representative uh said you know a single
 
00:34:37.669 --> 00:34:37.679 align:start position:0%
line going across
 
00:34:40.149 --> 00:34:40.159 align:start position:0%
uh which in fact doesn't make it bad it
 
00:34:43.669 --> 00:34:43.679 align:start position:0%
just says that's the way it is and
 
00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:46.399 align:start position:0%
uh so it shifts part of that population
 
00:34:46.399 --> 00:34:47.430 align:start position:0%
uh so it shifts part of that population
from

00:34:47.430 --> 00:34:47.440 align:start position:0%
from
 
00:34:49.829 --> 00:34:49.839 align:start position:0%
district one down into that area and
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
then does what the people up in sullivan
 
00:34:54.710 --> 00:34:54.720 align:start position:0%
county said to do
 
00:34:56.069 --> 00:34:56.079 align:start position:0%
is that
 
00:34:58.470 --> 00:34:58.480 align:start position:0%
they felt that they had an association
 
00:35:02.069 --> 00:35:02.079 align:start position:0%
with vermont and keeping them together
 
00:35:02.079 --> 00:35:03.270 align:start position:0%
with vermont and keeping them together
and

00:35:03.270 --> 00:35:03.280 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:05.910 --> 00:35:05.920 align:start position:0%
an association with vermont
 
00:35:08.790 --> 00:35:08.800 align:start position:0%
that was beneficial to them
 
00:35:11.349 --> 00:35:11.359 align:start position:0%
we tried to not do
 
00:35:12.870 --> 00:35:12.880 align:start position:0%
very much in
 
00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:15.520 align:start position:0%
districts three and four
 
00:35:17.030 --> 00:35:17.040 align:start position:0%
to keep them
 
00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:19.440 align:start position:0%
relatively the same
 
00:35:20.710 --> 00:35:20.720 align:start position:0%
and 5
 
00:35:23.670 --> 00:35:23.680 align:start position:0%
again due to those population
 
00:35:26.710 --> 00:35:26.720 align:start position:0%
not any other nefarious thing
 
00:35:26.720 --> 00:35:27.990 align:start position:0%
not any other nefarious thing
but

00:35:27.990 --> 00:35:28.000 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:30.560 align:start position:0%
due to population trying to get
 
00:35:33.589 --> 00:35:33.599 align:start position:0%
those maps very close and in fact the
 
00:35:35.910 --> 00:35:35.920 align:start position:0%
population was uh
 
00:35:38.310 --> 00:35:38.320 align:start position:0%
uh i guess it's not quite half but it's
 
00:35:40.870 --> 00:35:40.880 align:start position:0%
closer to half of what the deviation
 
00:35:44.390 --> 00:35:44.400 align:start position:0%
would have been at 2.7 i think it's one
 
00:35:47.589 --> 00:35:47.599 align:start position:0%
something i i the number escapes me
 
00:35:48.630 --> 00:35:48.640 align:start position:0%
right now
 
00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.240 align:start position:0%
uh but uh
 
00:35:53.750 --> 00:35:53.760 align:start position:0%
remember that the thing that's in law
 
00:35:55.510 --> 00:35:55.520 align:start position:0%
you know you go back
 
00:35:55.520 --> 00:35:56.630 align:start position:0%
you know you go back
and

00:35:56.630 --> 00:35:56.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
populations as equal as possible
 
00:36:02.710 --> 00:36:02.720 align:start position:0%
practical you can go look the word up
 
00:36:05.030 --> 00:36:05.040 align:start position:0%
in the constitution
 
00:36:07.910 --> 00:36:07.920 align:start position:0%
these people that talk about compactness
 
00:36:09.910 --> 00:36:09.920 align:start position:0%
these people that talk about other
 
00:36:09.920 --> 00:36:11.349 align:start position:0%
these people that talk about other
things

00:36:11.349 --> 00:36:11.359 align:start position:0%
things
 
00:36:13.349 --> 00:36:13.359 align:start position:0%
to show to me in the law and i probably
 
00:36:15.349 --> 00:36:15.359 align:start position:0%
would have done different things
 
00:36:15.359 --> 00:36:16.150 align:start position:0%
would have done different things
but

00:36:16.150 --> 00:36:16.160 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:36:17.910 --> 00:36:17.920 align:start position:0%
that's not in law
 
00:36:21.430 --> 00:36:21.440 align:start position:0%
law is population population population
 
00:36:23.270 --> 00:36:23.280 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the supreme court
 
00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:24.710 align:start position:0%
and if you look at the supreme court
decision

00:36:24.710 --> 00:36:24.720 align:start position:0%
decision
 
00:36:27.349 --> 00:36:27.359 align:start position:0%
manchester v gardener
 
00:36:29.990 --> 00:36:30.000 align:start position:0%
and you look at it uh certainly it's
 
00:36:31.990 --> 00:36:32.000 align:start position:0%
clear in there
 
00:36:34.630 --> 00:36:34.640 align:start position:0%
and we certainly did use that as a
 
00:36:34.640 --> 00:36:35.670 align:start position:0%
and we certainly did use that as a
reference

00:36:35.670 --> 00:36:35.680 align:start position:0%
reference
 
00:36:37.349 --> 00:36:37.359 align:start position:0%
in the things that we did with the
 
00:36:39.670 --> 00:36:39.680 align:start position:0%
various maps
 
00:36:44.069 --> 00:36:44.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:46.390 --> 00:36:46.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair uh
 
00:36:48.390 --> 00:36:48.400 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me as a matter of
 
00:36:50.630 --> 00:36:50.640 align:start position:0%
first principles that
 
00:36:53.589 --> 00:36:53.599 align:start position:0%
an affinity with vermont for the river
 
00:36:55.589 --> 00:36:55.599 align:start position:0%
towns has nothing to do with
 
00:36:57.270 --> 00:36:57.280 align:start position:0%
redistricting because there are still
 
00:36:58.950 --> 00:36:58.960 align:start position:0%
going to be river towns and vermont is
 
00:37:00.870 --> 00:37:00.880 align:start position:0%
still going to stay where it is
 
00:37:04.069 --> 00:37:04.079 align:start position:0%
i will not agree with you what i
 
00:37:05.829 --> 00:37:05.839 align:start position:0%
my testimony was
 
00:37:07.670 --> 00:37:07.680 align:start position:0%
is that at the hearings in sullivan
 
00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:08.630 align:start position:0%
is that at the hearings in sullivan
county

00:37:08.630 --> 00:37:08.640 align:start position:0%
county
 
00:37:10.950 --> 00:37:10.960 align:start position:0%
that was a request
 
00:37:13.349 --> 00:37:13.359 align:start position:0%
now another question a valid request i
 
00:37:14.950 --> 00:37:14.960 align:start position:0%
guess you can take that up with the
 
00:37:17.270 --> 00:37:17.280 align:start position:0%
people at the hearing that made that
 
00:37:19.030 --> 00:37:19.040 align:start position:0%
request but
 
00:37:21.270 --> 00:37:21.280 align:start position:0%
we did listen to them and we do know
 
00:37:22.550 --> 00:37:22.560 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:24.800 align:start position:0%
many of things that do happen across the
 
00:37:26.630 --> 00:37:26.640 align:start position:0%
border and across the river
 
00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:27.670 align:start position:0%
border and across the river
and

00:37:27.670 --> 00:37:27.680 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:28.720 align:start position:0%
in fact
 
00:37:31.190 --> 00:37:31.200 align:start position:0%
a lot of times people cross the border
 
00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:32.560 align:start position:0%
to go down
 
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:34.560 align:start position:0%
the the road so that they can come back
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
into hampshire and that's actually
 
00:37:39.109 --> 00:37:39.119 align:start position:0%
you know quicker for them than traveling
 
00:37:41.109 --> 00:37:41.119 align:start position:0%
just the roads in new hampshire so there
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
is an association be whether you like it
 
00:37:46.630 --> 00:37:46.640 align:start position:0%
or not it was expressed in the hearings
 
00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:54.230 align:start position:0%
or not it was expressed in the hearings
follow-up

00:37:54.230 --> 00:37:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:58.310 --> 00:37:58.320 align:start position:0%
okay i'll leave that one um
 
00:38:00.790 --> 00:38:00.800 align:start position:0%
this next question is not a not
 
00:38:02.710 --> 00:38:02.720 align:start position:0%
speculative because it's a matter of
 
00:38:05.510 --> 00:38:05.520 align:start position:0%
population and the way the lines were
 
00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.790 align:start position:0%
population and the way the lines were
drawn

00:38:06.790 --> 00:38:06.800 align:start position:0%
drawn
 
00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.990 align:start position:0%
drawn
so

00:38:11.990 --> 00:38:12.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:15.829 --> 00:38:15.839 align:start position:0%
isn't it true that as the maps are
 
00:38:17.349 --> 00:38:17.359 align:start position:0%
currently drawn
 
00:38:22.069 --> 00:38:22.079 align:start position:0%
with the population being very much
 
00:38:25.349 --> 00:38:25.359 align:start position:0%
in the south of both district 2 and
 
00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:27.280 align:start position:0%
district 1
 
00:38:29.990 --> 00:38:30.000 align:start position:0%
that it is conceivable that the north
 
00:38:32.790 --> 00:38:32.800 align:start position:0%
country will wind up with no effective
 
00:38:35.750 --> 00:38:35.760 align:start position:0%
representation whatsoever under this map
 
00:38:37.510 --> 00:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
could you please define effective
 
00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:40.150 align:start position:0%
could you please define effective
representation

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:40.160 align:start position:0%
representation
 
00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:45.280 align:start position:0%
uh isn't it true that you may have one
 
00:38:49.910 --> 00:38:49.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:38:53.030 --> 00:38:53.040 align:start position:0%
concord and one counselor from over in
 
00:38:55.349 --> 00:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
the very farthest
 
00:38:55.359 --> 00:38:57.030 align:start position:0%
the very farthest
south

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:57.040 align:start position:0%
south
 
00:39:00.510 --> 00:39:00.520 align:start position:0%
east corner both of whom are from larger
 
00:39:05.030 --> 00:39:05.040 align:start position:0%
metropolitan areas which have look very
 
00:39:05.040 --> 00:39:07.030 align:start position:0%
metropolitan areas which have look very
unlike

00:39:07.030 --> 00:39:07.040 align:start position:0%
unlike
 
00:39:09.990 --> 00:39:10.000 align:start position:0%
most of the north country as it is now
 
00:39:12.390 --> 00:39:12.400 align:start position:0%
constituted i think the committee can
 
00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:14.640 align:start position:0%
stipulate that rural communities are
 
00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040 align:start position:0%
different than metropolitan areas
 
00:39:18.630 --> 00:39:18.640 align:start position:0%
senator gray do you want to answer that
 
00:39:21.190 --> 00:39:21.200 align:start position:0%
question or not i certainly you know by
 
00:39:23.109 --> 00:39:23.119 align:start position:0%
looking at this map
 
00:39:27.430 --> 00:39:27.440 align:start position:0%
i can draw a very small circle um that
 
00:39:30.069 --> 00:39:30.079 align:start position:0%
you know would encompass part of uh one
 
00:39:32.069 --> 00:39:32.079 align:start position:0%
part of two part of
 
00:39:34.470 --> 00:39:34.480 align:start position:0%
four and part of five
 
00:39:36.950 --> 00:39:36.960 align:start position:0%
uh or any other combination of four of
 
00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:38.880 align:start position:0%
those and
 
00:39:41.270 --> 00:39:41.280 align:start position:0%
you know cover it with a probably a 50
 
00:39:43.190 --> 00:39:43.200 align:start position:0%
cent piece the way this map is
 
00:39:45.270 --> 00:39:45.280 align:start position:0%
is printed so
 
00:39:47.030 --> 00:39:47.040 align:start position:0%
is it possible
 
00:39:47.040 --> 00:39:47.910 align:start position:0%
is it possible
yeah

00:39:47.910 --> 00:39:47.920 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:39:49.910 --> 00:39:49.920 align:start position:0%
but who's making the choice
 
00:39:51.510 --> 00:39:51.520 align:start position:0%
the voters in the state of new hampshire
 
00:39:53.750 --> 00:39:53.760 align:start position:0%
are making the choice and
 
00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:56.960 align:start position:0%
to say that a population deviation of
 
00:39:59.910 --> 00:39:59.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:02.069 --> 00:40:02.079 align:start position:0%
is not preferable to a population
 
00:40:06.069 --> 00:40:06.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:40:08.790 --> 00:40:08.800 align:start position:0%
is ridiculous and one final matter one
 
00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:11.280 align:start position:0%
final follow-up
 
00:40:13.670 --> 00:40:13.680 align:start position:0%
my final follow-up is
 
00:40:16.710 --> 00:40:16.720 align:start position:0%
the observation that isn't it true that
 
00:40:18.950 --> 00:40:18.960 align:start position:0%
because we are only dealing with five
 
00:40:21.829 --> 00:40:21.839 align:start position:0%
districts and many many many towns there
 
00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:24.160 align:start position:0%
are any number of ways that you could
 
00:40:26.150 --> 00:40:26.160 align:start position:0%
have put this together unlike the house
 
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
maps where it's very difficult
 
00:40:30.390 --> 00:40:30.400 align:start position:0%
where you would have achieved the same
 
00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.990 align:start position:0%
where you would have achieved the same
population

00:40:31.990 --> 00:40:32.000 align:start position:0%
population
 
00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:34.160 align:start position:0%
or better and
 
00:40:35.990 --> 00:40:36.000 align:start position:0%
probably not better it's pretty good for
 
00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.270 align:start position:0%
probably not better it's pretty good for
deviation

00:40:37.270 --> 00:40:37.280 align:start position:0%
deviation
 
00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:39.680 align:start position:0%
and not
 
00:40:41.589 --> 00:40:41.599 align:start position:0%
confused the communities of interest to
 
00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:44.160 align:start position:0%
the extent that this map does
 
00:40:46.150 --> 00:40:46.160 align:start position:0%
you had me representative weber until
 
00:40:48.390 --> 00:40:48.400 align:start position:0%
you said confused communities of
 
00:40:50.950 --> 00:40:50.960 align:start position:0%
interest could you rephrase that
 
00:40:53.349 --> 00:40:53.359 align:start position:0%
madam chair if if you want to go ahead
 
00:40:55.430 --> 00:40:55.440 align:start position:0%
and answer it go ahead briefly please
 
00:40:58.150 --> 00:40:58.160 align:start position:0%
senator i will stipulate that there are
 
00:41:00.950 --> 00:41:00.960 align:start position:0%
probably millions of ways
 
00:41:03.670 --> 00:41:03.680 align:start position:0%
to do this map
 
00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:05.680 align:start position:0%
my job
 
00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.630 align:start position:0%
my job
and

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:06.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:41:09.109 --> 00:41:09.119 align:start position:0%
again i looked for the the supreme court
 
00:41:11.750 --> 00:41:11.760 align:start position:0%
decision manchester v gardner
 
00:41:13.349 --> 00:41:13.359 align:start position:0%
about what they did when they were
 
00:41:15.910 --> 00:41:15.920 align:start position:0%
looking at the various maps and saying
 
00:41:18.550 --> 00:41:18.560 align:start position:0%
okay where do i start where where do i
 
00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:19.430 align:start position:0%
okay where do i start where where do i
go

00:41:19.430 --> 00:41:19.440 align:start position:0%
go
 
00:41:22.309 --> 00:41:22.319 align:start position:0%
okay and decisions get made
 
00:41:25.109 --> 00:41:25.119 align:start position:0%
a decision in manchester and a decision
 
00:41:27.349 --> 00:41:27.359 align:start position:0%
in nashua
 
00:41:30.470 --> 00:41:30.480 align:start position:0%
can make a big impact on
 
00:41:32.630 --> 00:41:32.640 align:start position:0%
other portions of this map and when
 
00:41:36.950 --> 00:41:36.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:41:39.510 --> 00:41:39.520 align:start position:0%
we took into consideration the the wants
 
00:41:41.990 --> 00:41:42.000 align:start position:0%
and that we could from the various
 
00:41:44.550 --> 00:41:44.560 align:start position:0%
hearings that we held we did our best
 
00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:46.880 align:start position:0%
this is the map in front of you
 
00:41:49.630 --> 00:41:49.640 align:start position:0%
it is not the 99
 
00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
999 other ones that could be drawn
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
further questions from the committee
 
00:41:59.190 --> 00:41:59.200 align:start position:0%
representative wilhelm
 
00:42:00.710 --> 00:42:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair senator thanks for
 
00:42:03.190 --> 00:42:03.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question um it's my
 
00:42:05.430 --> 00:42:05.440 align:start position:0%
understanding that
 
00:42:07.829 --> 00:42:07.839 align:start position:0%
this bill came out of the election law
 
00:42:10.710 --> 00:42:10.720 align:start position:0%
committee in the senate uh with the
 
00:42:12.630 --> 00:42:12.640 align:start position:0%
districts the current districts still
 
00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.710 align:start position:0%
districts the current districts still
intact

00:42:14.710 --> 00:42:14.720 align:start position:0%
intact
 
00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:16.640 align:start position:0%
and then there was a floor amendment
 
00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh which is what we're reviewing today
 
00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:22.480 align:start position:0%
what prompted the floor amendment what
 
00:42:25.109 --> 00:42:25.119 align:start position:0%
why why a floor amendment after
 
00:42:25.119 --> 00:42:26.150 align:start position:0%
why why a floor amendment after
the

00:42:26.150 --> 00:42:26.160 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:42:28.230 --> 00:42:28.240 align:start position:0%
districts that were
 
00:42:29.829 --> 00:42:29.839 align:start position:0%
you know put through the election law
 
00:42:29.839 --> 00:42:31.190 align:start position:0%
you know put through the election law
committee

00:42:31.190 --> 00:42:31.200 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:42:33.750 --> 00:42:33.760 align:start position:0%
there was consensus at that time what
 
00:42:35.510 --> 00:42:35.520 align:start position:0%
what happened between
 
00:42:37.670 --> 00:42:37.680 align:start position:0%
the committee meeting and the time the
 
00:42:39.589 --> 00:42:39.599 align:start position:0%
bill hit the floor of the senate
 
00:42:41.910 --> 00:42:41.920 align:start position:0%
i can tell you that uh if you go back
 
00:42:45.270 --> 00:42:45.280 align:start position:0%
through the hearings and various
 
00:42:47.109 --> 00:42:47.119 align:start position:0%
things that that happened in the
 
00:42:47.119 --> 00:42:48.470 align:start position:0%
things that that happened in the
committee

00:42:48.470 --> 00:42:48.480 align:start position:0%
committee
 
00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:50.079 align:start position:0%
that there are
 
00:42:51.829 --> 00:42:51.839 align:start position:0%
there were people
 
00:42:54.390 --> 00:42:54.400 align:start position:0%
and the testimony both in the senate
 
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:56.400 align:start position:0%
hearings and the hearings across the
 
00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:57.349 align:start position:0%
hearings and the hearings across the
state

00:42:57.349 --> 00:42:57.359 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:43:00.069 --> 00:43:00.079 align:start position:0%
that something be done with district two
 
00:43:03.270 --> 00:43:03.280 align:start position:0%
but again as i mentioned before
 
00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:05.359 align:start position:0%
you need to count to 13 to be able to
 
00:43:07.910 --> 00:43:07.920 align:start position:0%
pass anything in the senate
 
00:43:10.710 --> 00:43:10.720 align:start position:0%
so we continue to work on that we
 
00:43:12.950 --> 00:43:12.960 align:start position:0%
continue to try to improve it we
 
00:43:15.109 --> 00:43:15.119 align:start position:0%
continue to try to get that population
 
00:43:18.710 --> 00:43:18.720 align:start position:0%
down further than the 2.7
 
00:43:21.829 --> 00:43:21.839 align:start position:0%
that population that was in the map that
 
00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:24.480 align:start position:0%
was voted out of the committee
 
00:43:24.480 --> 00:43:25.349 align:start position:0%
was voted out of the committee
and

00:43:25.349 --> 00:43:25.359 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:43:27.510 --> 00:43:27.520 align:start position:0%
we were able to achieve that
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
and then
 
00:43:31.510 --> 00:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
that uh prompted a four floor amendment
 
00:43:33.750 --> 00:43:33.760 align:start position:0%
because of procedure

further questions from committee members
 
00:43:38.950 --> 00:43:38.960 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
00:43:41.270 --> 00:43:41.280 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairman and thank you
 
00:43:43.670 --> 00:43:43.680 align:start position:0%
senator for taking my question um my
 
00:43:46.470 --> 00:43:46.480 align:start position:0%
question relates to the fair maps effort
 
00:43:47.990 --> 00:43:48.000 align:start position:0%
i attended
 
00:43:51.270 --> 00:43:51.280 align:start position:0%
my county's redistricting meeting and i
 
00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:53.670 align:start position:0%
my county's redistricting meeting and i
also

00:43:53.670 --> 00:43:53.680 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:55.670 --> 00:43:55.680 align:start position:0%
know the person in my town who presented
 
00:43:57.349 --> 00:43:57.359 align:start position:0%
a warrant article at our last town
 
00:43:59.670 --> 00:43:59.680 align:start position:0%
meeting which passed and i understand
 
00:44:01.510 --> 00:44:01.520 align:start position:0%
it's about 74 towns past warrant
 
00:44:03.750 --> 00:44:03.760 align:start position:0%
articles asking for fair maps and i
 
00:44:06.150 --> 00:44:06.160 align:start position:0%
understand that the word fair is in the
 
00:44:08.150 --> 00:44:08.160 align:start position:0%
eye of the beholder perhaps but i
 
00:44:10.950 --> 00:44:10.960 align:start position:0%
believe that the mapathon effort
 
00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:13.200 align:start position:0%
worked to try and supply maps that were
 
00:44:15.750 --> 00:44:15.760 align:start position:0%
fair in that they were
 
00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:17.030 align:start position:0%
fair in that they were
not

00:44:17.030 --> 00:44:17.040 align:start position:0%
not
 
00:44:19.349 --> 00:44:19.359 align:start position:0%
designed to help any party but rather to
 
00:44:21.829 --> 00:44:21.839 align:start position:0%
advantage the voter and i wonder if you
 
00:44:23.510 --> 00:44:23.520 align:start position:0%
could speak to
 
00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:25.910 align:start position:0%
could speak to
the

00:44:25.910 --> 00:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:44:28.950 --> 00:44:28.960 align:start position:0%
the map that you've given here as to how
 
00:44:30.790 --> 00:44:30.800 align:start position:0%
how it
 
00:44:32.710 --> 00:44:32.720 align:start position:0%
how it stands up against the other maps
 
00:44:34.230 --> 00:44:34.240 align:start position:0%
that were presented i know you've said
 
00:44:35.589 --> 00:44:35.599 align:start position:0%
you could do it a million different ways
 
00:44:36.870 --> 00:44:36.880 align:start position:0%
it's true
 
00:44:39.270 --> 00:44:39.280 align:start position:0%
there are many ways to slice up a map
 
00:44:41.349 --> 00:44:41.359 align:start position:0%
but i think we i think the committee was
 
00:44:44.309 --> 00:44:44.319 align:start position:0%
presented with maps that were
 
00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:46.560 align:start position:0%
um more fair than this map that we're
 
00:44:47.910 --> 00:44:47.920 align:start position:0%
looking at right now
 
00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:50.640 align:start position:0%
and i wish you could speak to that
 
00:44:53.589 --> 00:44:53.599 align:start position:0%
i don't know what more fair means i know
 
00:44:56.390 --> 00:44:56.400 align:start position:0%
what what legal means i know what the
 
00:44:59.190 --> 00:44:59.200 align:start position:0%
constitution says about equal population
 
00:45:01.430 --> 00:45:01.440 align:start position:0%
i know that many of the maps that were
 
00:45:04.390 --> 00:45:04.400 align:start position:0%
presented from the fair map people had
 
00:45:06.230 --> 00:45:06.240 align:start position:0%
errors in them that i pointed out to
 
00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:07.030 align:start position:0%
errors in them that i pointed out to
them

00:45:07.030 --> 00:45:07.040 align:start position:0%
them
 
00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:10.240 align:start position:0%
one of the maps had a town
 
00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:11.030 align:start position:0%
one of the maps had a town
for

00:45:11.030 --> 00:45:11.040 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:13.520 align:start position:0%
this particular map i believe
 
00:45:15.349 --> 00:45:15.359 align:start position:0%
that was
 
00:45:17.349 --> 00:45:17.359 align:start position:0%
misplaced in the district when we were
 
00:45:20.069 --> 00:45:20.079 align:start position:0%
looking at retaining the stuff i know
 
00:45:23.270 --> 00:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
that they prove they wanted nashua and
 
00:45:25.910 --> 00:45:25.920 align:start position:0%
proposed to nashua that they have a
 
00:45:28.870 --> 00:45:28.880 align:start position:0%
population deviation of eight
 
00:45:31.829 --> 00:45:31.839 align:start position:0%
approximately eight down in nashua which
 
00:45:33.910 --> 00:45:33.920 align:start position:0%
certainly in my opinion doesn't follow
 
00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:36.560 align:start position:0%
the state constitution in trying to get
 
00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520 align:start position:0%
equal population as equal as you can
 
00:45:41.270 --> 00:45:41.280 align:start position:0%
they have
 
00:45:43.750 --> 00:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
an agenda that said that we need to keep
 
00:45:45.990 --> 00:45:46.000 align:start position:0%
school districts together i will tell
 
00:45:47.030 --> 00:45:47.040 align:start position:0%
you that
 
00:45:49.270 --> 00:45:49.280 align:start position:0%
i have been a representative i have been
 
00:45:51.190 --> 00:45:51.200 align:start position:0%
a school board member i have been a city
 
00:45:54.069 --> 00:45:54.079 align:start position:0%
councilman and i have been a senator and
 
00:45:56.470 --> 00:45:56.480 align:start position:0%
as i move up the chain
 
00:45:58.470 --> 00:45:58.480 align:start position:0%
school districts become
 
00:46:01.910 --> 00:46:01.920 align:start position:0%
less a thing that that i need to
 
00:46:04.630 --> 00:46:04.640 align:start position:0%
associate real closely with
 
00:46:07.349 --> 00:46:07.359 align:start position:0%
uh as i go up and so
 
00:46:09.750 --> 00:46:09.760 align:start position:0%
trying to take that school thing and
 
00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:10.710 align:start position:0%
trying to take that school thing and
saying

00:46:10.710 --> 00:46:10.720 align:start position:0%
saying
 
00:46:12.550 --> 00:46:12.560 align:start position:0%
i'm going to make a congressional map
 
00:46:14.630 --> 00:46:14.640 align:start position:0%
because i'm going to move this town
 
00:46:16.230 --> 00:46:16.240 align:start position:0%
because it keeps the school district
 
00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:17.510 align:start position:0%
because it keeps the school district
together

00:46:17.510 --> 00:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
together
 
00:46:17.520 --> 00:46:18.390 align:start position:0%
together
uh

00:46:18.390 --> 00:46:18.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:46:20.470 --> 00:46:20.480 align:start position:0%
it did not pass the common sense with
 
00:46:21.670 --> 00:46:21.680 align:start position:0%
tests with me
 
00:46:24.069 --> 00:46:24.079 align:start position:0%
that when i was a school board member
 
00:46:26.550 --> 00:46:26.560 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay when i was a city
 
00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.670 align:start position:0%
absolutely okay when i was a city
councilman

00:46:27.670 --> 00:46:27.680 align:start position:0%
councilman
 
00:46:30.630 --> 00:46:30.640 align:start position:0%
yeah i want to keep that in but as i get
 
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:32.800 align:start position:0%
to be a representative and more broad
 
00:46:36.309 --> 00:46:36.319 align:start position:0%
interpretation and now as a senator
 
00:46:39.430 --> 00:46:39.440 align:start position:0%
it's just not a practical criteria thank
 
00:46:40.870 --> 00:46:40.880 align:start position:0%
you senator further questions from
 
00:46:47.990 --> 00:46:48.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:46:51.430 --> 00:46:51.440 align:start position:0%
are keeping counties together no longer
 
00:46:53.270 --> 00:46:53.280 align:start position:0%
a consideration for you because i
 
00:46:56.309 --> 00:46:56.319 align:start position:0%
noticed that these districts
 
00:46:59.349 --> 00:46:59.359 align:start position:0%
have very little respect for county
 
00:47:00.870 --> 00:47:00.880 align:start position:0%
lines or
 
00:47:03.670 --> 00:47:03.680 align:start position:0%
the concerns of people on the county
 
00:47:05.750 --> 00:47:05.760 align:start position:0%
level which is a much broader level than
 
00:47:08.069 --> 00:47:08.079 align:start position:0%
the school district two things i'd like
 
00:47:10.230 --> 00:47:10.240 align:start position:0%
to say about that i represent two
 
00:47:12.230 --> 00:47:12.240 align:start position:0%
counties right now stafford county and
 
00:47:15.430 --> 00:47:15.440 align:start position:0%
belknap county i think that going to the
 
00:47:17.270 --> 00:47:17.280 align:start position:0%
various meetings that i do in both
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
counties gives me a better perspective
 
00:47:23.670 --> 00:47:23.680 align:start position:0%
of what the general population across
 
00:47:26.870 --> 00:47:26.880 align:start position:0%
the two counties that i represent
 
00:47:28.950 --> 00:47:28.960 align:start position:0%
i also want to point out that when
 
00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:29.690 align:start position:0%
i also want to point out that when
mapathon

00:47:29.690 --> 00:47:29.700 align:start position:0%
mapathon
 
00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:30.790 align:start position:0%
mapathon
[Music]

00:47:30.790 --> 00:47:30.800 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:47:32.470 --> 00:47:32.480 align:start position:0%
started this
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
and they started to look at communities
 
00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:36.880 align:start position:0%
of interest i was told by one of their
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
representatives that their original list
 
00:47:42.950 --> 00:47:42.960 align:start position:0%
of communities of interest contained
 
00:47:46.390 --> 00:47:46.400 align:start position:0%
more than 60 items
 
00:47:49.589 --> 00:47:49.599 align:start position:0%
and that those were winnowed down to the
 
00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:52.800 align:start position:0%
ones that you see in the maps so just as
 
00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:56.160 align:start position:0%
i could have another 10 000
 
00:47:59.109 --> 00:47:59.119 align:start position:0%
you know different maps i can also have
 
00:48:01.750 --> 00:48:01.760 align:start position:0%
another combination of communities of
 
00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:04.160 align:start position:0%
interest that were at least something
 
00:48:06.790 --> 00:48:06.800 align:start position:0%
that they can they considered as
 
00:48:08.390 --> 00:48:08.400 align:start position:0%
communities of interest when they
 
00:48:10.630 --> 00:48:10.640 align:start position:0%
started to do the maps
 
00:48:14.470 --> 00:48:14.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:16.309 --> 00:48:16.319 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
00:48:19.349 --> 00:48:19.359 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um senator
 
00:48:19.359 --> 00:48:20.390 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair um senator
uh

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:20.400 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:48:23.349 --> 00:48:23.359 align:start position:0%
i agree that defining a fair map is
 
00:48:25.270 --> 00:48:25.280 align:start position:0%
a difficult process
 
00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:28.160 align:start position:0%
would you agree that a fair mat means
 
00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:31.520 align:start position:0%
that the district is as competitive as
 
00:48:31.520 --> 00:48:34.230 align:start position:0%
that the district is as competitive as
possible

00:48:34.230 --> 00:48:34.240 align:start position:0%
possible
 
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.430 align:start position:0%
possible
no

00:48:35.430 --> 00:48:35.440 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:48:38.150 --> 00:48:38.160 align:start position:0%
and let me explain that
 
00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:39.190 align:start position:0%
and let me explain that
okay

00:48:39.190 --> 00:48:39.200 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:48:42.470 --> 00:48:42.480 align:start position:0%
if i go and stick a pin in portsmouth
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
and i try to make a map that's
 
00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:45.990 align:start position:0%
and i try to make a map that's
competitive

00:48:45.990 --> 00:48:46.000 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
00:48:48.390 --> 00:48:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh portsmouth is
 
00:48:51.910 --> 00:48:51.920 align:start position:0%
uh lean's very very democratic and if i
 
00:48:54.790 --> 00:48:54.800 align:start position:0%
try to make it competitive by going
 
00:48:57.589 --> 00:48:57.599 align:start position:0%
somewhere and i'm not quite sure where
 
00:49:00.230 --> 00:49:00.240 align:start position:0%
to make it competitive i have done a
 
00:49:02.630 --> 00:49:02.640 align:start position:0%
disservice to those people in portsmouth
 
00:49:06.150 --> 00:49:06.160 align:start position:0%
if i stick a pin in belknap county
 
00:49:07.829 --> 00:49:07.839 align:start position:0%
we'll say
 
00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:08.510 align:start position:0%
up in
 
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:10.230 align:start position:0%
up in
[Music]

00:49:10.230 --> 00:49:10.240 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:49:13.030 --> 00:49:13.040 align:start position:0%
alton for example and i try to make that
 
00:49:15.349 --> 00:49:15.359 align:start position:0%
a competitive district
 
00:49:17.589 --> 00:49:17.599 align:start position:0%
there's not a whole lot of things that
 
00:49:19.829 --> 00:49:19.839 align:start position:0%
you can do to make it a competitive
 
00:49:22.230 --> 00:49:22.240 align:start position:0%
district and i have done
 
00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:25.839 align:start position:0%
a disservice i believe that that is also
 
00:49:27.990 --> 00:49:28.000 align:start position:0%
in the definition of gerrymandering
 
00:49:30.790 --> 00:49:30.800 align:start position:0%
saying that i'm going to make this thing
 
00:49:33.589 --> 00:49:33.599 align:start position:0%
competitive no matter what
 
00:49:36.230 --> 00:49:36.240 align:start position:0%
the basis of the people are no matter
 
00:49:39.030 --> 00:49:39.040 align:start position:0%
what the population is and if you're
 
00:49:40.870 --> 00:49:40.880 align:start position:0%
going to expand your definition of
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering the way
 
00:49:45.109 --> 00:49:45.119 align:start position:0%
some of the representatives have
 
00:49:45.119 --> 00:49:45.910 align:start position:0%
some of the representatives have
have

00:49:45.910 --> 00:49:45.920 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:49:48.790 --> 00:49:48.800 align:start position:0%
expressed opinions today uh then that
 
00:49:51.109 --> 00:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
would also fall into your definition of
 
00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:53.200 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering further questions from
 
00:49:55.030 --> 00:49:55.040 align:start position:0%
committee members madam chair
 
00:49:57.030 --> 00:49:57.040 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron thank you madam
 
00:49:59.750 --> 00:49:59.760 align:start position:0%
chair senator um
 
00:50:02.549 --> 00:50:02.559 align:start position:0%
just a question
 
00:50:04.790 --> 00:50:04.800 align:start position:0%
the existing population in the five
 
00:50:06.630 --> 00:50:06.640 align:start position:0%
council districts
 
00:50:10.470 --> 00:50:10.480 align:start position:0%
currently has a deviation of 2.27
 
00:50:12.870 --> 00:50:12.880 align:start position:0%
without doing any changes at all
 
00:50:15.270 --> 00:50:15.280 align:start position:0%
did the senate take into consideration
 
00:50:17.109 --> 00:50:17.119 align:start position:0%
that they didn't need to redistrict at
 
00:50:17.119 --> 00:50:18.470 align:start position:0%
that they didn't need to redistrict at
all

00:50:18.470 --> 00:50:18.480 align:start position:0%
all
 
00:50:20.470 --> 00:50:20.480 align:start position:0%
the senate certainly did take that into
 
00:50:22.870 --> 00:50:22.880 align:start position:0%
consideration the senate and the hearing
 
00:50:25.190 --> 00:50:25.200 align:start position:0%
that was held in the senate was a
 
00:50:28.309 --> 00:50:28.319 align:start position:0%
hearing on the map as unchanged but
 
00:50:30.390 --> 00:50:30.400 align:start position:0%
there were people
 
00:50:32.069 --> 00:50:32.079 align:start position:0%
probably some of the same people you'll
 
00:50:34.470 --> 00:50:34.480 align:start position:0%
hear from today that still pointed to
 
00:50:37.270 --> 00:50:37.280 align:start position:0%
district 2 and said district 2 because
 
00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:40.720 align:start position:0%
it is one town long and stretches from
 
00:50:42.790 --> 00:50:42.800 align:start position:0%
the west side of the state to the east
 
00:50:45.349 --> 00:50:45.359 align:start position:0%
side of the state wanted to see a change
 
00:50:47.750 --> 00:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
we were able to find a map
 
00:50:49.349 --> 00:50:49.359 align:start position:0%
that was presented in the floor
 
00:50:51.349 --> 00:50:51.359 align:start position:0%
amendment that you see in front of you
 
00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:54.240 align:start position:0%
that reduced that population deviation
 
00:50:56.790 --> 00:50:56.800 align:start position:0%
further making us more compliant with
 
00:50:59.190 --> 00:50:59.200 align:start position:0%
the state constitution
 
00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:01.520 align:start position:0%
and producing a map that you see in
 
00:51:03.910 --> 00:51:03.920 align:start position:0%
front of you thank you senator further
 
00:51:08.069 --> 00:51:08.079 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.670 --> 00:51:09.680 align:start position:0%

all right so at this point i will reopen
 
00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:20.160 align:start position:0%

and we will also continue now with 241
 
00:51:27.990 --> 00:51:28.000 align:start position:0%

olivia zink executive director for open
democracy

00:52:25.190 --> 00:52:25.200 align:start position:0%
democracy
 
00:52:28.069 --> 00:52:28.079 align:start position:0%
i'm a pro-voter pro-voter nonpartisan
 
00:52:30.150 --> 00:52:30.160 align:start position:0%
organization based in concord and i live
 
00:52:32.390 --> 00:52:32.400 align:start position:0%
in franklin
 
00:52:35.109 --> 00:52:35.119 align:start position:0%
i want to first before i start my
 
00:52:38.710 --> 00:52:38.720 align:start position:0%
testimony just comment on
 
00:52:40.630 --> 00:52:40.640 align:start position:0%
senator gray's example of using
 
00:52:43.430 --> 00:52:43.440 align:start position:0%
portsmouth to create a safe republican
 
00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.470 align:start position:0%
portsmouth to create a safe republican
district

00:52:44.470 --> 00:52:44.480 align:start position:0%
district
 
00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:45.349 align:start position:0%
district
he

00:52:45.349 --> 00:52:45.359 align:start position:0%
he
 
00:52:47.670 --> 00:52:47.680 align:start position:0%
exactly did that in the executive
 
00:52:49.270 --> 00:52:49.280 align:start position:0%
council districts
 
00:52:52.390 --> 00:52:52.400 align:start position:0%
so uh it is possible to make portsmouth
 
00:52:54.390 --> 00:52:54.400 align:start position:0%
a safe republican district and they have
 
00:52:58.150 --> 00:52:58.160 align:start position:0%
done that um in that executive
 
00:53:00.069 --> 00:53:00.079 align:start position:0%
council district such so executive
 
00:53:01.990 --> 00:53:02.000 align:start position:0%
council district one
 
00:53:05.430 --> 00:53:05.440 align:start position:0%
changes when i think under undergoes the
 
00:53:07.910 --> 00:53:07.920 align:start position:0%
most amount of changes in this map
 
00:53:07.920 --> 00:53:09.190 align:start position:0%
most amount of changes in this map
um

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:09.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:11.030 align:start position:0%
um
including

00:53:11.030 --> 00:53:11.040 align:start position:0%
including
 
00:53:11.040 --> 00:53:12.309 align:start position:0%
including
claremont

00:53:12.309 --> 00:53:12.319 align:start position:0%
claremont
 
00:53:14.390 --> 00:53:14.400 align:start position:0%
hanover lebanon littleton
 
00:53:17.109 --> 00:53:17.119 align:start position:0%
in grafton county also putting parts of
 
00:53:21.270 --> 00:53:21.280 align:start position:0%
coos carroll belknap counties
 
00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:23.760 align:start position:0%
over in to the other districts
 
00:53:26.470 --> 00:53:26.480 align:start position:0%
district 2
 
00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:27.430 align:start position:0%
district 2
also

00:53:27.430 --> 00:53:27.440 align:start position:0%
also
 
00:53:29.750 --> 00:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
undergoes a lot of changes i talk about
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
them specifically in my testimony and
 
00:53:34.549 --> 00:53:34.559 align:start position:0%
since you have that in front of you
 
00:53:36.870 --> 00:53:36.880 align:start position:0%
but i think it's really it does lose a
 
00:53:38.950 --> 00:53:38.960 align:start position:0%
whole portion
 
00:53:41.349 --> 00:53:41.359 align:start position:0%
from the current executive council maps
 
00:53:43.589 --> 00:53:43.599 align:start position:0%
so we are no longer a geographical
 
00:53:45.670 --> 00:53:45.680 align:start position:0%
executive council districts
 
00:53:45.680 --> 00:53:46.950 align:start position:0%
executive council districts
um

00:53:46.950 --> 00:53:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:49.190 --> 00:53:49.200 align:start position:0%
these maps have been
 
00:53:49.200 --> 00:53:49.990 align:start position:0%
these maps have been
um

00:53:49.990 --> 00:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:53:52.470 --> 00:53:52.480 align:start position:0%
reshaped and i kind of think of that as
 
00:53:54.150 --> 00:53:54.160 align:start position:0%
a little bit of an e you come from
 
00:53:56.710 --> 00:53:56.720 align:start position:0%
littleton you go into concord and then
 
00:53:59.030 --> 00:53:59.040 align:start position:0%
you go down to peterborough
 
00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.549 align:start position:0%
you go down to peterborough
um

00:54:00.549 --> 00:54:00.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:03.190 --> 00:54:03.200 align:start position:0%
packing as many democratic towns as they
 
00:54:05.510 --> 00:54:05.520 align:start position:0%
possibly could into that executive
 
00:54:07.349 --> 00:54:07.359 align:start position:0%
council district
 
00:54:07.359 --> 00:54:08.549 align:start position:0%
council district
um

00:54:08.549 --> 00:54:08.559 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:08.559 --> 00:54:10.630 align:start position:0%
um
too

00:54:10.630 --> 00:54:10.640 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:12.150 align:start position:0%
too
um

00:54:12.150 --> 00:54:12.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:54:15.109 --> 00:54:15.119 align:start position:0%
district three remains exactly the same
 
00:54:17.910 --> 00:54:17.920 align:start position:0%
as the as the other districts
 
00:54:21.109 --> 00:54:21.119 align:start position:0%
um in my testimony i do talk about
 
00:54:23.670 --> 00:54:23.680 align:start position:0%
um what the governor has said on new
 
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:25.839 align:start position:0%
hampshire public radio in the exchange
 
00:54:28.069 --> 00:54:28.079 align:start position:0%
about the executive council maps
 
00:54:31.109 --> 00:54:31.119 align:start position:0%
um and i think it's important that the
 
00:54:33.829 --> 00:54:33.839 align:start position:0%
whatever this body decides that they're
 
00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:36.880 align:start position:0%
we don't get stuck in a place
 
00:54:39.109 --> 00:54:39.119 align:start position:0%
and also in my testimony i do talk about
 
00:54:41.030 --> 00:54:41.040 align:start position:0%
this is the first time
 
00:54:42.870 --> 00:54:42.880 align:start position:0%
this this meeting right now is the first
 
00:54:45.349 --> 00:54:45.359 align:start position:0%
time the public has had a chance
 
00:54:48.630 --> 00:54:48.640 align:start position:0%
to give input on this proposal
 
00:54:50.950 --> 00:54:50.960 align:start position:0%
um when the public hearing was in the
 
00:54:53.430 --> 00:54:53.440 align:start position:0%
senate there was a different senate
 
00:54:55.750 --> 00:54:55.760 align:start position:0%
proposal for the executive council map
 
00:54:58.309 --> 00:54:58.319 align:start position:0%
so this is the first time
 
00:55:00.789 --> 00:55:00.799 align:start position:0%
in the process that the public has been
 
00:55:03.750 --> 00:55:03.760 align:start position:0%
able to give input on this specific map
 
00:55:07.829 --> 00:55:07.839 align:start position:0%
and i again think um urge you to amend
 
00:55:09.670 --> 00:55:09.680 align:start position:0%
this map so that you're serving all
 
00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.270 align:start position:0%
this map so that you're serving all
voters

00:55:11.270 --> 00:55:11.280 align:start position:0%
voters
 
00:55:13.109 --> 00:55:13.119 align:start position:0%
and then you also have testimony from
 
00:55:16.630 --> 00:55:16.640 align:start position:0%
joanne emis and hollis ian burke and
 
00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:19.520 align:start position:0%
in keene ellen farnham and tamworth and
 
00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:20.549 align:start position:0%
in keene ellen farnham and tamworth and
catherine

00:55:20.549 --> 00:55:20.559 align:start position:0%
catherine
 
00:55:21.829 --> 00:55:21.839 align:start position:0%
in sunapee
 
00:55:24.150 --> 00:55:24.160 align:start position:0%
that i also handed out who could not be
 
00:55:28.230 --> 00:55:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:30.230 --> 00:55:30.240 align:start position:0%
thank you um i have a question i have
 
00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.910 align:start position:0%
thank you um i have a question i have
written

00:55:31.910 --> 00:55:31.920 align:start position:0%
written
 
00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440 align:start position:0%
oh they're stapled together that's
 
00:55:35.190 --> 00:55:35.200 align:start position:0%
what's being passed out now i held it
 
00:55:36.789 --> 00:55:36.799 align:start position:0%
because i didn't know what i had all
 
00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480 align:start position:0%
right so this is further i think we
 
00:55:40.309 --> 00:55:40.319 align:start position:0%
might have gotten emails from
 
00:55:42.230 --> 00:55:42.240 align:start position:0%
from some of them may have emailed their
 
00:55:44.309 --> 00:55:44.319 align:start position:0%
testimony but i know that there may be a
 
00:55:46.230 --> 00:55:46.240 align:start position:0%
vote on this so i wanted to make sure
 
00:55:48.630 --> 00:55:48.640 align:start position:0%
their testimony got in front of you
 
00:55:52.789 --> 00:55:52.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:57.109 --> 00:55:57.119 align:start position:0%
 
00:55:59.430 --> 00:55:59.440 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:01.920 align:start position:0%
also i also signed up to speak today on
 
00:56:05.349 --> 00:56:05.359 align:start position:0%
these bills um and on both bills is
 
00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:23.040 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:25.270 --> 00:56:25.280 align:start position:0%
good morning madam chair and members of
 
00:56:27.829 --> 00:56:27.839 align:start position:0%
the special committee on redistricting
 
00:56:30.470 --> 00:56:30.480 align:start position:0%
i didn't bring printed copies but i did
 
00:56:33.270 --> 00:56:33.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:36.630 --> 00:56:36.640 align:start position:0%
um when drawing we just and this is with
 
00:56:39.109 --> 00:56:39.119 align:start position:0%
respect to sp240
 
00:56:40.870 --> 00:56:40.880 align:start position:0%
when drawing redistricting maps
 
00:56:43.910 --> 00:56:43.920 align:start position:0%
population deviation limits are mandated
 
00:56:46.549 --> 00:56:46.559 align:start position:0%
by the state constitution
 
00:56:48.390 --> 00:56:48.400 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire attended
 
00:56:51.349 --> 00:56:51.359 align:start position:0%
public hearing sessions in each county
 
00:56:54.390 --> 00:56:54.400 align:start position:0%
and submitted additional criteria beyond
 
00:56:57.349 --> 00:56:57.359 align:start position:0%
the mathematics of population that they
 
00:56:59.910 --> 00:56:59.920 align:start position:0%
believed to be essential considerations
 
00:57:02.230 --> 00:57:02.240 align:start position:0%
when creating the maps
 
00:57:05.510 --> 00:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
most often cited were high school saus
 
00:57:07.589 --> 00:57:07.599 align:start position:0%
shared emergency services
 
00:57:10.069 --> 00:57:10.079 align:start position:0%
water and sewer systems and public
 
00:57:10.079 --> 00:57:10.829 align:start position:0%
water and sewer systems and public
health

00:57:10.829 --> 00:57:10.839 align:start position:0%
health
 
00:57:15.109 --> 00:57:15.119 align:start position:0%
facilities while the maps in sb 240 do
 
00:57:18.470 --> 00:57:18.480 align:start position:0%
meet population deviation requirements
 
00:57:20.549 --> 00:57:20.559 align:start position:0%
they fall short with respect to best
 
00:57:23.270 --> 00:57:23.280 align:start position:0%
practices in redistricting and applying
 
00:57:25.510 --> 00:57:25.520 align:start position:0%
the criteria requested by granite
 
00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.990 align:start position:0%
the criteria requested by granite
staters

00:57:27.990 --> 00:57:28.000 align:start position:0%
staters
 
00:57:31.030 --> 00:57:31.040 align:start position:0%
the 2010 senate map already reflected
 
00:57:33.030 --> 00:57:33.040 align:start position:0%
partisan advantage
 
00:57:35.349 --> 00:57:35.359 align:start position:0%
in 2020 the election results were
 
00:57:38.829 --> 00:57:38.839 align:start position:0%
divided 50-50 between republicans and
 
00:57:41.750 --> 00:57:41.760 align:start position:0%
democrats but the senate seat split was
 
00:57:45.109 --> 00:57:45.119 align:start position:0%
14 republicans and 10 democrats
 
00:57:48.309 --> 00:57:48.319 align:start position:0%
the map proposed by sb 240 would have
 
00:57:51.190 --> 00:57:51.200 align:start position:0%
resulted in greater partisan advantage
 
00:57:54.230 --> 00:57:54.240 align:start position:0%
in the 2020 elections yielding 15
 
00:57:57.670 --> 00:57:57.680 align:start position:0%
republican seats and nine democratic
 
00:57:59.990 --> 00:58:00.000 align:start position:0%
some towns that lean democratic have
 
00:58:02.069 --> 00:58:02.079 align:start position:0%
been packed into nine districts while
 
00:58:03.670 --> 00:58:03.680 align:start position:0%
others have been split among the
 
00:58:07.109 --> 00:58:07.119 align:start position:0%
remaining 15 districts
 
00:58:09.829 --> 00:58:09.839 align:start position:0%
in my region of the state hillsborough
 
00:58:12.870 --> 00:58:12.880 align:start position:0%
county towns of hancock and peterborough
 
00:58:15.430 --> 00:58:15.440 align:start position:0%
have been moved into district 10 making
 
00:58:18.549 --> 00:58:18.559 align:start position:0%
it more democratic at the same time
 
00:58:20.870 --> 00:58:20.880 align:start position:0%
causing my own district 8 and also
 
00:58:24.470 --> 00:58:24.480 align:start position:0%
district 9 to lean more republican
 
00:58:26.470 --> 00:58:26.480 align:start position:0%
district 5 is packed with three
 
00:58:28.950 --> 00:58:28.960 align:start position:0%
democratic college towns that are
 
00:58:31.910 --> 00:58:31.920 align:start position:0%
presently in separate districts
 
00:58:34.230 --> 00:58:34.240 align:start position:0%
compactness is a best practice that can
 
00:58:37.430 --> 00:58:37.440 align:start position:0%
keep communities of interest intact
 
00:58:40.069 --> 00:58:40.079 align:start position:0%
the proposed map has a low compactness
 
00:58:41.990 --> 00:58:42.000 align:start position:0%
score when analyzed by
 
00:58:47.430 --> 00:58:47.440 align:start position:0%
dra 2020 and splits 36 high school saus
 
00:58:50.309 --> 00:58:50.319 align:start position:0%
keeping saus intact was the single most
 
00:58:51.990 --> 00:58:52.000 align:start position:0%
important community of interest
 
00:58:55.750 --> 00:58:55.760 align:start position:0%
criterion requested by citizen input
 
00:58:59.030 --> 00:58:59.040 align:start position:0%
district 9 is decidedly not compact
 
00:59:01.510 --> 00:59:01.520 align:start position:0%
being one town wide from hinsdale to
 
00:59:03.430 --> 00:59:03.440 align:start position:0%
bedford across
 
00:59:05.990 --> 00:59:06.000 align:start position:0%
73 miles excuse me
 
00:59:08.549 --> 00:59:08.559 align:start position:0%
i believe that the maps proposed by sb
 
00:59:10.950 --> 00:59:10.960 align:start position:0%
240 are not in the best interest of the
 
00:59:12.870 --> 00:59:12.880 align:start position:0%
citizens of new hampshire
 
00:59:16.470 --> 00:59:16.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:22.069 --> 00:59:22.079 align:start position:0%
thank you and with respect to sb 241
 
00:59:25.030 --> 00:59:25.040 align:start position:0%
the executive council maps of 2010 have
 
00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:26.640 align:start position:0%
served as a poster child for
 
00:59:29.670 --> 00:59:29.680 align:start position:0%
gerrymandering the proposed maps and sb
 
00:59:33.270 --> 00:59:33.280 align:start position:0%
241 look better but in reality are more
 
00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:34.549 align:start position:0%
241 look better but in reality are more
partisan

00:59:34.549 --> 00:59:34.559 align:start position:0%
partisan
 
00:59:36.789 --> 00:59:36.799 align:start position:0%
district 2 no longer stretches across
 
00:59:39.750 --> 00:59:39.760 align:start position:0%
the state from west to east however it
 
00:59:41.589 --> 00:59:41.599 align:start position:0%
does reach north to littleton and
 
00:59:44.710 --> 00:59:44.720 align:start position:0%
carroll west to concord and peterborough
 
00:59:48.390 --> 00:59:48.400 align:start position:0%
and south to hinsdale and winchester
 
00:59:51.270 --> 00:59:51.280 align:start position:0%
district 2 leans more heavily democratic
 
00:59:53.829 --> 00:59:53.839 align:start position:0%
and district 1 is more republican than
 
00:59:53.839 --> 00:59:55.030 align:start position:0%
and district 1 is more republican than
before

00:59:55.030 --> 00:59:55.040 align:start position:0%
before
 
00:59:57.430 --> 00:59:57.440 align:start position:0%
districts 3 4 and 5 are somewhat
 
01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:00.319 align:start position:0%
competitive but lean republican the
 
01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
voices of voters matter
 
01:00:04.950 --> 01:00:04.960 align:start position:0%
a recent unh poll indicates that 80
 
01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:07.280 align:start position:0%
percent of voters do not think the
 
01:00:09.349 --> 01:00:09.359 align:start position:0%
strict maps are fair
 
01:00:12.470 --> 01:00:12.480 align:start position:0%
certainly for republicans in district 2
 
01:00:15.190 --> 01:00:15.200 align:start position:0%
and democrats in district 1 votes will
 
01:00:17.829 --> 01:00:17.839 align:start position:0%
not weigh equally
 
01:00:20.710 --> 01:00:20.720 align:start position:0%
these maps also split 17 high school
 
01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:25.040 align:start position:0%
saus and also 9 of 10 counties are split
 
01:00:27.109 --> 01:00:27.119 align:start position:0%
i believe that these maps do not serve
 
01:00:30.789 --> 01:00:30.799 align:start position:0%
granite staters well i ask you to amend
 
01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680 align:start position:0%
amend these maps to draw maps that do
 
01:00:35.349 --> 01:00:35.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration of my
 
01:00:35.359 --> 01:00:36.630 align:start position:0%
thank you for your consideration of my
testimony

01:00:36.630 --> 01:00:36.640 align:start position:0%
testimony
 
01:00:38.549 --> 01:00:38.559 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:00:42.390 --> 01:00:42.400 align:start position:0%
any questions for miss bundy
 
01:00:44.309 --> 01:00:44.319 align:start position:0%
she tries to escape all the time before
 
01:00:46.230 --> 01:00:46.240 align:start position:0%
i ask that question she comes in front
 
01:00:48.390 --> 01:00:48.400 align:start position:0%
of election too
 
01:00:50.789 --> 01:00:50.799 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um also signed up to
 
01:01:00.950 --> 01:01:00.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:09.670 --> 01:01:09.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:12.710 --> 01:01:12.720 align:start position:0%
 
01:01:14.309 --> 01:01:14.319 align:start position:0%
welcome good morning
 
01:01:17.990 --> 01:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
good morning geography and members
 
01:01:20.549 --> 01:01:20.559 align:start position:0%
i believe i'm speaking on 240 first is
 
01:01:22.710 --> 01:01:22.720 align:start position:0%
that correct you can go i have every
 
01:01:24.230 --> 01:01:24.240 align:start position:0%
confidence the committee can keep
 
01:01:25.589 --> 01:01:25.599 align:start position:0%
together the difference between the
 
01:01:28.549 --> 01:01:28.559 align:start position:0%
executive council and senate maps so
 
01:01:30.950 --> 01:01:30.960 align:start position:0%
where i can is my well that's somewhat
 
01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.870 align:start position:0%
where i can is my well that's somewhat
true

01:01:32.870 --> 01:01:32.880 align:start position:0%
true
 
01:01:35.190 --> 01:01:35.200 align:start position:0%
my name is corrine dodge i'm a voter in
 
01:01:37.349 --> 01:01:37.359 align:start position:0%
derry new hampshire and i thank you for
 
01:01:40.069 --> 01:01:40.079 align:start position:0%
giving me the opportunity to testify
 
01:01:43.750 --> 01:01:43.760 align:start position:0%
against sb 240 for the proposed senate
 
01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:46.079 align:start position:0%
redistricting map
 
01:01:47.910 --> 01:01:47.920 align:start position:0%
i believe that we can all agree that
 
01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:50.720 align:start position:0%
redistricting is a rather time consuming
 
01:01:52.950 --> 01:01:52.960 align:start position:0%
and expensive process
 
01:01:54.630 --> 01:01:54.640 align:start position:0%
and that the purpose of redes
 
01:01:57.270 --> 01:01:57.280 align:start position:0%
districting is to even out the number of
 
01:01:59.910 --> 01:01:59.920 align:start position:0%
voters in each district because of
 
01:02:02.470 --> 01:02:02.480 align:start position:0%
population changes during the past 10
 
01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:04.480 align:start position:0%
year period
 
01:02:07.029 --> 01:02:07.039 align:start position:0%
ethically this process should be done as
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
fairly and as transparently as possible
 
01:02:15.109 --> 01:02:15.119 align:start position:0%
to give all voters a chance to be heard
 
01:02:17.990 --> 01:02:18.000 align:start position:0%
ideally a district's population would be
 
01:02:20.549 --> 01:02:20.559 align:start position:0%
evened out by grouping communities of
 
01:02:23.750 --> 01:02:23.760 align:start position:0%
interest like high school saus together
 
01:02:25.990 --> 01:02:26.000 align:start position:0%
this district this way districts can
 
01:02:28.470 --> 01:02:28.480 align:start position:0%
elect officials who will effectively
 
01:02:30.950 --> 01:02:30.960 align:start position:0%
represent their communities
 
01:02:33.349 --> 01:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
and that's the most important part not
 
01:02:35.589 --> 01:02:35.599 align:start position:0%
whether it's saus it's whether they can
 
01:02:35.599 --> 01:02:38.309 align:start position:0%
whether it's saus it's whether they can
effectively

01:02:38.309 --> 01:02:38.319 align:start position:0%
effectively
 
01:02:41.349 --> 01:02:41.359 align:start position:0%
represent the people that voted in that
 
01:02:44.230 --> 01:02:44.240 align:start position:0%
district that's the most crucial part in
 
01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:45.760 align:start position:0%
my mind
 
01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:48.319 align:start position:0%
the minority and mapathon independent
 
01:02:51.910 --> 01:02:51.920 align:start position:0%
citizens mapping project proposed maps
 
01:02:56.789 --> 01:02:56.799 align:start position:0%
do a better job of keeping saus together
 
01:03:00.309 --> 01:03:00.319 align:start position:0%
and of creating compact districts
 
01:03:03.589 --> 01:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
so that those those representatives can
 
01:03:07.029 --> 01:03:07.039 align:start position:0%
represent their constituents
 
01:03:09.750 --> 01:03:09.760 align:start position:0%
these proposals i'm sorry these proposed
 
01:03:12.549 --> 01:03:12.559 align:start position:0%
proposals should be considered and i ask
 
01:03:14.309 --> 01:03:14.319 align:start position:0%
you to do so
 
01:03:16.630 --> 01:03:16.640 align:start position:0%
the purpose of redistricting
 
01:03:20.549 --> 01:03:20.559 align:start position:0%
should not be to silence voters voices
 
01:03:22.789 --> 01:03:22.799 align:start position:0%
nor should it be a one-sided political
 
01:03:25.829 --> 01:03:25.839 align:start position:0%
party scramble to assure the election
 
01:03:28.870 --> 01:03:28.880 align:start position:0%
the re-elections of as many incumbent
 
01:03:31.670 --> 01:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
senators from the majority party as
 
01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.430 align:start position:0%
senators from the majority party as
possible

01:03:33.430 --> 01:03:33.440 align:start position:0%
possible
 
01:03:35.109 --> 01:03:35.119 align:start position:0%
and if 50 percent of new hampshire
 
01:03:38.230 --> 01:03:38.240 align:start position:0%
voters vote democrat and 50 percent vote
 
01:03:40.870 --> 01:03:40.880 align:start position:0%
republican in the next election
 
01:03:43.109 --> 01:03:43.119 align:start position:0%
with the maps being considered today the
 
01:03:44.390 --> 01:03:44.400 align:start position:0%
result would be
 
01:03:50.549 --> 01:03:50.559 align:start position:0%
a consistent 16 to 8 veto proof majority
 
01:03:53.109 --> 01:03:53.119 align:start position:0%
if 50 of voters vote for one party and
 
01:03:55.430 --> 01:03:55.440 align:start position:0%
50 for the other the senate should be a
 
01:03:57.349 --> 01:03:57.359 align:start position:0%
12 12 split
 
01:03:59.270 --> 01:03:59.280 align:start position:0%
not a gerrymandered
 
01:04:01.430 --> 01:04:01.440 align:start position:0%
6 to 18
 
01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.470 align:start position:0%
6 to 18
vote

01:04:02.470 --> 01:04:02.480 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:04:04.230 --> 01:04:04.240 align:start position:0%
that's what i call gerrymandering when
 
01:04:07.190 --> 01:04:07.200 align:start position:0%
the results come out consistently
 
01:04:08.950 --> 01:04:08.960 align:start position:0%
16 to 8
 
01:04:10.549 --> 01:04:10.559 align:start position:0%
when it's small
 
01:04:12.950 --> 01:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
when it's more likely mathematically to
 
01:04:14.870 --> 01:04:14.880 align:start position:0%
be 12 to 12
 
01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:15.990 align:start position:0%
be 12 to 12
split

01:04:15.990 --> 01:04:16.000 align:start position:0%
split
 
01:04:18.789 --> 01:04:18.799 align:start position:0%
i ask that you support all new hampshire
 
01:04:22.549 --> 01:04:22.559 align:start position:0%

thank you um
 
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:28.480 align:start position:0%
should i do them yeah do them both and
 
01:04:29.910 --> 01:04:29.920 align:start position:0%
then i'll ask for questions oh i'm sorry
 
01:04:32.870 --> 01:04:32.880 align:start position:0%
i forgot i'm supposed to ask questions
 
01:04:34.950 --> 01:04:34.960 align:start position:0%
i'm still not used to how this is this
 
01:04:36.630 --> 01:04:36.640 align:start position:0%
is we're doing this a little differently
 
01:04:38.710 --> 01:04:38.720 align:start position:0%
i know that i know that and i'm very
 
01:04:41.670 --> 01:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
nervous as i always am so
 
01:04:43.430 --> 01:04:43.440 align:start position:0%
you do a terrific job you should not be
 
01:04:45.109 --> 01:04:45.119 align:start position:0%
nervous we we know you're always
 
01:04:48.069 --> 01:04:48.079 align:start position:0%
prepared so welcome and
 
01:04:49.430 --> 01:04:49.440 align:start position:0%
2 41.
 
01:04:52.230 --> 01:04:52.240 align:start position:0%
good morning chad graham and members and
 
01:04:53.910 --> 01:04:53.920 align:start position:0%
thank you for giving me the opportunity
 
01:04:57.589 --> 01:04:57.599 align:start position:0%
to testify my name is corinne dodge
 
01:05:01.510 --> 01:05:01.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:05.510 --> 01:05:05.520 align:start position:0%
i am asking you to vote against sb 241
 
01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:08.640 align:start position:0%
for the proposed executive council map i
 
01:05:11.190 --> 01:05:11.200 align:start position:0%
have two reasons for this request
 
01:05:13.430 --> 01:05:13.440 align:start position:0%
one of them has already been stated is
 
01:05:15.670 --> 01:05:15.680 align:start position:0%
that we haven't had a public hearing on
 
01:05:18.789 --> 01:05:18.799 align:start position:0%
it and i believe that's important
 
01:05:21.190 --> 01:05:21.200 align:start position:0%
and it was voted on without that
 
01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:22.720 align:start position:0%
so i won't go into
 
01:05:25.349 --> 01:05:25.359 align:start position:0%
into that any further i think that's
 
01:05:27.029 --> 01:05:27.039 align:start position:0%
already been stated
 
01:05:31.349 --> 01:05:31.359 align:start position:0%
i admit that sb 241 clearly changes the
 
01:05:31.359 --> 01:05:32.549 align:start position:0%
i admit that sb 241 clearly changes the
look

01:05:32.549 --> 01:05:32.559 align:start position:0%
look
 
01:05:35.589 --> 01:05:35.599 align:start position:0%
of what i call the gerrymandered 2010
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
executive council map with its dragon
 
01:05:43.109 --> 01:05:43.119 align:start position:0%
district 2 design however
 
01:05:46.069 --> 01:05:46.079 align:start position:0%
the partisan intent intent is still the
 
01:05:49.589 --> 01:05:49.599 align:start position:0%
same allowing the majority party to gain
 
01:05:54.470 --> 01:05:54.480 align:start position:0%
political power over the opposing party
 
01:05:57.109 --> 01:05:57.119 align:start position:0%
that's wrong whether who's in charge and
 
01:05:59.750 --> 01:05:59.760 align:start position:0%
who's the opposing party
 
01:06:01.589 --> 01:06:01.599 align:start position:0%
in my mind
 
01:06:04.870 --> 01:06:04.880 align:start position:0%
district 2 still collects democratic
 
01:06:07.750 --> 01:06:07.760 align:start position:0%
leading towns just going up the ritter
 
01:06:10.390 --> 01:06:10.400 align:start position:0%
river instead of across the state
 
01:06:13.270 --> 01:06:13.280 align:start position:0%
with so many democratic leaning towns
 
01:06:16.230 --> 01:06:16.240 align:start position:0%
republican voters in district two
 
01:06:19.349 --> 01:06:19.359 align:start position:0%
are basically meaningless and olivia
 
01:06:21.029 --> 01:06:21.039 align:start position:0%
zinke did a really good job of
 
01:06:23.190 --> 01:06:23.200 align:start position:0%
describing what it feels like to be a
 
01:06:25.349 --> 01:06:25.359 align:start position:0%
voter in a district that you know your
 
01:06:27.190 --> 01:06:27.200 align:start position:0%
vote is not even going to count so why
 
01:06:27.200 --> 01:06:28.710 align:start position:0%
vote is not even going to count so why
bother

01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:28.720 align:start position:0%
bother
 
01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.750 align:start position:0%
bother
sorry

01:06:31.750 --> 01:06:31.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:33.109 align:start position:0%
 
likewise

01:06:33.109 --> 01:06:33.119 align:start position:0%
likewise
 
01:06:35.510 --> 01:06:35.520 align:start position:0%
district 4 leans republican
 
01:06:37.910 --> 01:06:37.920 align:start position:0%
making it hard for democrats in this
 
01:06:41.109 --> 01:06:41.119 align:start position:0%
district to have their voices heard
 
01:06:45.990 --> 01:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
is this what democracy should be about
 
01:06:51.029 --> 01:06:51.039 align:start position:0%
protecting political parties over voters
 
01:06:53.270 --> 01:06:53.280 align:start position:0%
do away with this funny-looking dragon
 
01:06:55.430 --> 01:06:55.440 align:start position:0%
map and voila the problem of
 
01:06:58.630 --> 01:06:58.640 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered map magically goes away no
 
01:07:00.789 --> 01:07:00.799 align:start position:0%
no it doesn't
 
01:07:03.029 --> 01:07:03.039 align:start position:0%
we all know that
 
01:07:05.589 --> 01:07:05.599 align:start position:0%
what we need is competitive maps where
 
01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:09.119 align:start position:0%
legislators work hard to represent all
 
01:07:10.950 --> 01:07:10.960 align:start position:0%
their constituents
 
01:07:12.470 --> 01:07:12.480 align:start position:0%
where voters
 
01:07:14.789 --> 01:07:14.799 align:start position:0%
have a fair say in who will represent
 
01:07:14.799 --> 01:07:15.589 align:start position:0%
have a fair say in who will represent
them

01:07:15.589 --> 01:07:15.599 align:start position:0%
them
 
01:07:17.670 --> 01:07:17.680 align:start position:0%
their interests
 
01:07:20.630 --> 01:07:20.640 align:start position:0%
i urge the committee to amend
 
01:07:21.990 --> 01:07:22.000 align:start position:0%
whatever it is
 
01:07:25.670 --> 01:07:25.680 align:start position:0%
 
01:07:27.349 --> 01:07:27.359 align:start position:0%
that was the executive council you were
 
01:07:29.510 --> 01:07:29.520 align:start position:0%
talking about so thank you see we were
 
01:07:31.750 --> 01:07:31.760 align:start position:0%
paying attention we know any questions
 
01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:33.520 align:start position:0%
from ms dodge
 
01:07:35.430 --> 01:07:35.440 align:start position:0%
and you've gotten emails from us dodge
 
01:07:37.990 --> 01:07:38.000 align:start position:0%
also thank you thank you
 
01:07:40.390 --> 01:07:40.400 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this is liz
 
01:07:40.400 --> 01:08:06.230 align:start position:0%
also signed up to speak on this is liz
tentarelli

01:08:06.230 --> 01:08:06.240 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:08.150 --> 01:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and committee for
 
01:08:10.789 --> 01:08:10.799 align:start position:0%
this opportunity to speak my name is liz
 
01:08:13.270 --> 01:08:13.280 align:start position:0%
tentarelli i'm president of the league
 
01:08:15.270 --> 01:08:15.280 align:start position:0%
of women voters of new hampshire a
 
01:08:17.669 --> 01:08:17.679 align:start position:0%
nonpartisan organization
 
01:08:19.669 --> 01:08:19.679 align:start position:0%
that's been involved in the fight for
 
01:08:22.070 --> 01:08:22.080 align:start position:0%
fair maps here in new hampshire since at
 
01:08:25.829 --> 01:08:25.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:28.550 --> 01:08:28.560 align:start position:0%
so we're not newcomers to this things
 
01:08:30.309 --> 01:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
don't surprise us
 
01:08:32.950 --> 01:08:32.960 align:start position:0%
we get very actively involved but i will
 
01:08:35.510 --> 01:08:35.520 align:start position:0%
say right now i'm very discouraged i'm
 
01:08:38.550 --> 01:08:38.560 align:start position:0%
very discouraged by these two maps
 
01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:41.440 align:start position:0%
early in this process the chair of this
 
01:08:43.829 --> 01:08:43.839 align:start position:0%
committee said it's all about the
 
01:08:43.839 --> 01:08:45.030 align:start position:0%
committee said it's all about the
numbers

01:08:45.030 --> 01:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
numbers
 
01:08:46.950 --> 01:08:46.960 align:start position:0%
and the chair of the senate committee
 
01:08:49.349 --> 01:08:49.359 align:start position:0%
said the numbers work out when
 
01:08:52.390 --> 01:08:52.400 align:start position:0%
presenting one of the maps
 
01:08:55.110 --> 01:08:55.120 align:start position:0%
if that were true if this were only all
 
01:08:57.590 --> 01:08:57.600 align:start position:0%
about the numbers
 
01:08:59.510 --> 01:08:59.520 align:start position:0%
i don't think the maps would look this
 
01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:01.510 align:start position:0%
i don't think the maps would look this
way

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:01.520 align:start position:0%
way
 
01:09:03.749 --> 01:09:03.759 align:start position:0%
we know that on a national level we get
 
01:09:05.430 --> 01:09:05.440 align:start position:0%
congressional you know
 
01:09:07.669 --> 01:09:07.679 align:start position:0%
the constitution says we have to do this
 
01:09:10.390 --> 01:09:10.400 align:start position:0%
pennsylvania lost a seat california lost
 
01:09:11.430 --> 01:09:11.440 align:start position:0%
a seat
 
01:09:13.269 --> 01:09:13.279 align:start position:0%
texas gained two and there were some
 
01:09:14.709 --> 01:09:14.719 align:start position:0%
other changes
 
01:09:18.149 --> 01:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
so we expect changes
 
01:09:20.229 --> 01:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
but let me talk about the executive
 
01:09:23.269 --> 01:09:23.279 align:start position:0%
council map first uh i was very
 
01:09:25.829 --> 01:09:25.839 align:start position:0%
surprised to see that the original
 
01:09:27.910 --> 01:09:27.920 align:start position:0%
proposal that came out of the special
 
01:09:30.309 --> 01:09:30.319 align:start position:0%
redistricting committee was for the same
 
01:09:34.229 --> 01:09:34.239 align:start position:0%
map that we have mocked since 2011 when
 
01:09:36.309 --> 01:09:36.319 align:start position:0%
it was adopted
 
01:09:38.709 --> 01:09:38.719 align:start position:0%
as being obviously gerrymandered with
 
01:09:42.229 --> 01:09:42.239 align:start position:0%
district two tortured to become democrat
 
01:09:44.550 --> 01:09:44.560 align:start position:0%
and the other four strongly leaning
 
01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:46.149 align:start position:0%
and the other four strongly leaning
republican

01:09:46.149 --> 01:09:46.159 align:start position:0%
republican
 
01:09:48.550 --> 01:09:48.560 align:start position:0%
and so i said to a colleague when i
 
01:09:50.309 --> 01:09:50.319 align:start position:0%
heard there might be a change there
 
01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:52.400 align:start position:0%
might be an amendment i said well how
 
01:09:54.790 --> 01:09:54.800 align:start position:0%
much worse can they make it all right
 
01:09:57.830 --> 01:09:57.840 align:start position:0%
sorry i get a little cynical at times
 
01:09:57.840 --> 01:09:58.950 align:start position:0%
sorry i get a little cynical at times
um

01:09:58.950 --> 01:09:58.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:01.440 align:start position:0%
this one is worse
 
01:10:04.630 --> 01:10:04.640 align:start position:0%
district 2 now is even more strongly
 
01:10:08.390 --> 01:10:08.400 align:start position:0%
democrat than the district 11 i'm sorry
 
01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:11.360 align:start position:0%
district 2 that came out of 2011.
 
01:10:13.830 --> 01:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
five towns with
 
01:10:16.630 --> 01:10:16.640 align:start position:0%
significant size colleges have been
 
01:10:19.669 --> 01:10:19.679 align:start position:0%
crammed into district 2
 
01:10:22.630 --> 01:10:22.640 align:start position:0%
with their attendant liberal voters and
 
01:10:25.510 --> 01:10:25.520 align:start position:0%
liberal professors and so on
 
01:10:28.790 --> 01:10:28.800 align:start position:0%
but more than that district 2
 
01:10:31.830 --> 01:10:31.840 align:start position:0%
includes the town of hanover which of
 
01:10:35.350 --> 01:10:35.360 align:start position:0%
course is a college town it is also the
 
01:10:37.030 --> 01:10:37.040 align:start position:0%
the hometown
 
01:10:39.669 --> 01:10:39.679 align:start position:0%
of the candidate that held
 
01:10:39.679 --> 01:10:40.470 align:start position:0%
of the candidate that held
the

01:10:40.470 --> 01:10:40.480 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
district one executive council seat
 
01:10:47.189 --> 01:10:47.199 align:start position:0%
twice in the last 10 years
 
01:10:49.910 --> 01:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
not the current incumbent but somebody
 
01:10:53.830 --> 01:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
who won two elections to hold that seat
 
01:10:56.709 --> 01:10:56.719 align:start position:0%
that candidate no longer stands a chance
 
01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:00.400 align:start position:0%
in district one which he represented for
 
01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:02.239 align:start position:0%
four years
 
01:11:05.030 --> 01:11:05.040 align:start position:0%
because the lines had been drawn so the
 
01:11:08.070 --> 01:11:08.080 align:start position:0%
idea of what senator gray said of
 
01:11:10.310 --> 01:11:10.320 align:start position:0%
protecting incumbents
 
01:11:12.390 --> 01:11:12.400 align:start position:0%
not protecting exactly but rather
 
01:11:14.709 --> 01:11:14.719 align:start position:0%
respecting this we didn't want fights
 
01:11:17.430 --> 01:11:17.440 align:start position:0%
between incumbents obviously doesn't
 
01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:18.790 align:start position:0%
between incumbents obviously doesn't
apply

01:11:18.790 --> 01:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
apply
 
01:11:21.910 --> 01:11:21.920 align:start position:0%
to some people who held the seat well in
 
01:11:24.550 --> 01:11:24.560 align:start position:0%
the past
 
01:11:28.149 --> 01:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
in my written testimony i attached a
 
01:11:31.510 --> 01:11:31.520 align:start position:0%
a page at the end i even paid for color
 
01:11:34.070 --> 01:11:34.080 align:start position:0%
printing folks i rarely do this we are
 
01:11:35.510 --> 01:11:35.520 align:start position:0%
so cheap
 
01:11:35.520 --> 01:11:36.709 align:start position:0%
so cheap
um

01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:39.830 --> 01:11:39.840 align:start position:0%
this is the results of an
 
01:11:43.510 --> 01:11:43.520 align:start position:0%
study of the lien of the senate seats
 
01:11:46.149 --> 01:11:46.159 align:start position:0%
from 1994
 
01:11:46.159 --> 01:11:47.870 align:start position:0%
from 1994
through

01:11:47.870 --> 01:11:47.880 align:start position:0%
through
 
01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.510 align:start position:0%
through
2014.

01:11:49.510 --> 01:11:49.520 align:start position:0%
2014.
 
01:11:51.350 --> 01:11:51.360 align:start position:0%
it doesn't go beyond that because this
 
01:11:54.229 --> 01:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
report came out in 2016
 
01:11:57.430 --> 01:11:57.440 align:start position:0%
and i am not smart enough mathematically
 
01:11:59.590 --> 01:11:59.600 align:start position:0%
to update this
 
01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:01.760 align:start position:0%
but what you can see in this colored
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
chart is that for years
 
01:12:06.550 --> 01:12:06.560 align:start position:0%
the senate
 
01:12:09.590 --> 01:12:09.600 align:start position:0%
has won a disproportionate number of
 
01:12:09.600 --> 01:12:11.149 align:start position:0%
has won a disproportionate number of
seats

01:12:11.149 --> 01:12:11.159 align:start position:0%
seats
 
01:12:14.310 --> 01:12:14.320 align:start position:0%
disproportionate to the overall vote so
 
01:12:17.030 --> 01:12:17.040 align:start position:0%
if you ignore the efficiency gap for a
 
01:12:18.229 --> 01:12:18.239 align:start position:0%
bit because
 
01:12:20.950 --> 01:12:20.960 align:start position:0%
i'm not going to try to explain that
 
01:12:23.990 --> 01:12:24.000 align:start position:0%
just look at the number of seats shown
 
01:12:26.630 --> 01:12:26.640 align:start position:0%
in red for republican blue for democrat
 
01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:27.910 align:start position:0%
in red for republican blue for democrat
obviously

01:12:27.910 --> 01:12:27.920 align:start position:0%
obviously
 
01:12:30.229 --> 01:12:30.239 align:start position:0%
and within the circle it shows the
 
01:12:34.390 --> 01:12:34.400 align:start position:0%
percent that the voters got
 
01:12:36.630 --> 01:12:36.640 align:start position:0%
and we go
 
01:12:39.110 --> 01:12:39.120 align:start position:0%
it's just unbalanced
 
01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:42.400 align:start position:0%
uh so that we have a state
 
01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:43.189 align:start position:0%
uh so that we have a state
where

01:12:43.189 --> 01:12:43.199 align:start position:0%
where
 
01:12:46.550 --> 01:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
more people are undeclared than
 
01:12:49.270 --> 01:12:49.280 align:start position:0%
republican or democrat but when you look
 
01:12:52.310 --> 01:12:52.320 align:start position:0%
at the overall 2020 election results you
 
01:12:55.510 --> 01:12:55.520 align:start position:0%
realize that we are still a purple state
 
01:12:58.070 --> 01:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
the votes tend to go republic half
 
01:13:01.110 --> 01:13:01.120 align:start position:0%
republican half democrat
 
01:13:04.310 --> 01:13:04.320 align:start position:0%
not so with the senate seats
 
01:13:07.030 --> 01:13:07.040 align:start position:0%
and in the new senate map that has been
 
01:13:07.040 --> 01:13:08.709 align:start position:0%
and in the new senate map that has been
proposed

01:13:08.709 --> 01:13:08.719 align:start position:0%
proposed
 
01:13:11.110 --> 01:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
an analysis shows that there are now
 
01:13:14.149 --> 01:13:14.159 align:start position:0%
only four competitive seats for the
 
01:13:14.159 --> 01:13:15.750 align:start position:0%
only four competitive seats for the
senate

01:13:15.750 --> 01:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
senate
 
01:13:19.270 --> 01:13:19.280 align:start position:0%
that it is very likely even with that
 
01:13:22.550 --> 01:13:22.560 align:start position:0%
evenly split republican democrat vote in
 
01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:24.400 align:start position:0%
the next election
 
01:13:27.910 --> 01:13:27.920 align:start position:0%
there will be 15 republican seats out of
 
01:13:32.790 --> 01:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
24. 15 to 9 is very likely
 
01:13:35.270 --> 01:13:35.280 align:start position:0%
and i've mentioned some districts in
 
01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:36.880 align:start position:0%
there that are most
 
01:13:39.750 --> 01:13:39.760 align:start position:0%
heavily leaning one way or the other
 
01:13:41.990 --> 01:13:42.000 align:start position:0%
in this republican map
 
01:13:43.750 --> 01:13:43.760 align:start position:0%
so when the
 
01:13:46.149 --> 01:13:46.159 align:start position:0%
committee chairs say it's all about the
 
01:13:48.070 --> 01:13:48.080 align:start position:0%
numbers i'm
 
01:13:50.310 --> 01:13:50.320 align:start position:0%
skeptical i think it's all about the
 
01:13:51.990 --> 01:13:52.000 align:start position:0%
partisan lien
 
01:13:55.910 --> 01:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
what that means is that voters next fall
 
01:13:59.510 --> 01:13:59.520 align:start position:0%
if these maps go into effect
 
01:14:02.709 --> 01:14:02.719 align:start position:0%
will have only one opportunity to really
 
01:14:05.189 --> 01:14:05.199 align:start position:0%
have their vote count and that is in the
 
01:14:05.199 --> 01:14:06.709 align:start position:0%
have their vote count and that is in the
primary

01:14:06.709 --> 01:14:06.719 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:14:09.030 --> 01:14:09.040 align:start position:0%
and i don't know that we want that to
 
01:14:12.470 --> 01:14:12.480 align:start position:0%
happen typically we get about a 15
 
01:14:16.310 --> 01:14:16.320 align:start position:0%
voter turnout in primary elections
 
01:14:20.470 --> 01:14:20.480 align:start position:0%
people especially with over 400 000
 
01:14:23.270 --> 01:14:23.280 align:start position:0%
undeclared voters in the state they
 
01:14:25.189 --> 01:14:25.199 align:start position:0%
don't pay that much attention to
 
01:14:25.199 --> 01:14:26.550 align:start position:0%
don't pay that much attention to
primaries

01:14:26.550 --> 01:14:26.560 align:start position:0%
primaries
 
01:14:27.669 --> 01:14:27.679 align:start position:0%
and yet
 
01:14:30.550 --> 01:14:30.560 align:start position:0%
these maps predetermine the outcome
 
01:14:33.590 --> 01:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
whoever wins the primary in many of
 
01:14:36.310 --> 01:14:36.320 align:start position:0%
these districts whether it's senate or
 
01:14:38.310 --> 01:14:38.320 align:start position:0%
executive council
 
01:14:40.950 --> 01:14:40.960 align:start position:0%
will win the election
 
01:14:43.110 --> 01:14:43.120 align:start position:0%
thank you if you could wrap up i am
 
01:14:45.350 --> 01:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
wrapping i figured but i'm getting
 
01:14:46.790 --> 01:14:46.800 align:start position:0%
people looking saying why aren't you
 
01:14:48.790 --> 01:14:48.800 align:start position:0%
saying anything no no i'm wrapping up
 
01:14:51.270 --> 01:14:51.280 align:start position:0%
i'm saying as a nonpartisan organization
 
01:14:53.669 --> 01:14:53.679 align:start position:0%
i want all voters to have their voices
 
01:14:53.679 --> 01:14:54.790 align:start position:0%
i want all voters to have their voices
heard

01:14:54.790 --> 01:14:54.800 align:start position:0%
heard
 
01:14:56.950 --> 01:14:56.960 align:start position:0%
and while i can't guarantee everybody
 
01:14:59.510 --> 01:14:59.520 align:start position:0%
will vote in the primary i want those
 
01:15:02.310 --> 01:15:02.320 align:start position:0%
votes to count in the general election
 
01:15:04.870 --> 01:15:04.880 align:start position:0%
so i am wrapped up ms griffin and thank
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
you for this opportunity and if there
 
01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:09.040 align:start position:0%
are questions i would be glad to answer
 
01:15:11.510 --> 01:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
them as long as they don't ask me to
 
01:15:14.950 --> 01:15:14.960 align:start position:0%
explain efficiency gap
 
01:15:17.990 --> 01:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
questions for miss tentarelli
 
01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for the for the color print
 
01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:21.760 align:start position:0%
i'm always impressed by your paper which
 
01:15:24.229 --> 01:15:24.239 align:start position:0%
is colored and so it sticks out
 
01:15:26.790 --> 01:15:26.800 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:28.400 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you miss
 
01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:29.590 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you miss
centarelli

01:15:29.590 --> 01:15:29.600 align:start position:0%
centarelli
 
01:15:29.600 --> 01:15:30.790 align:start position:0%
centarelli
um

01:15:30.790 --> 01:15:30.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:15:33.830 --> 01:15:33.840 align:start position:0%
so how would you define a fair map
 
01:15:36.790 --> 01:15:36.800 align:start position:0%
a fair map is a map in which all the
 
01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.390 align:start position:0%
a fair map is a map in which all the
voters

01:15:38.390 --> 01:15:38.400 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:15:41.110 --> 01:15:41.120 align:start position:0%
get a chance to
 
01:15:43.590 --> 01:15:43.600 align:start position:0%
elect the candidate of their choice in
 
01:15:45.990 --> 01:15:46.000 align:start position:0%
the general election not just in the
 
01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:47.910 align:start position:0%
the general election not just in the
primary

01:15:47.910 --> 01:15:47.920 align:start position:0%
primary
 
01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
that isn't true when you get down to the
 
01:15:52.229 --> 01:15:52.239 align:start position:0%
town level people live in democrat or
 
01:15:55.910 --> 01:15:55.920 align:start position:0%
republican towns i quite realize that
 
01:15:58.070 --> 01:15:58.080 align:start position:0%
but by the time we get up to the senate
 
01:16:00.950 --> 01:16:00.960 align:start position:0%
and the executive council districts and
 
01:16:03.590 --> 01:16:03.600 align:start position:0%
certainly the congressional districts
 
01:16:05.270 --> 01:16:05.280 align:start position:0%
every vote should be
 
01:16:07.990 --> 01:16:08.000 align:start position:0%
counted counted and have a fair chance
 
01:16:10.149 --> 01:16:10.159 align:start position:0%
of being counted that's my idea of fair
 
01:16:10.159 --> 01:16:11.350 align:start position:0%
of being counted that's my idea of fair
maps

01:16:11.350 --> 01:16:11.360 align:start position:0%
maps
 
01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.110 align:start position:0%
maps
follow-up

01:16:13.110 --> 01:16:13.120 align:start position:0%
follow-up
 
01:16:15.030 --> 01:16:15.040 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:18.229 --> 01:16:18.239 align:start position:0%
is that also consistent with the numbers
 
01:16:21.910 --> 01:16:21.920 align:start position:0%
in order to get the um
 
01:16:23.750 --> 01:16:23.760 align:start position:0%
the diverse not diversity the
 
01:16:25.590 --> 01:16:25.600 align:start position:0%
equalization of the population do you
 
01:16:27.430 --> 01:16:27.440 align:start position:0%
think there's a way to balance that
 
01:16:28.790 --> 01:16:28.800 align:start position:0%
between the two
 
01:16:31.430 --> 01:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
i i think it's possible in the executive
 
01:16:33.750 --> 01:16:33.760 align:start position:0%
council maps to have them drawn very
 
01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.430 align:start position:0%
council maps to have them drawn very
differently

01:16:35.430 --> 01:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
differently
 
01:16:37.990 --> 01:16:38.000 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure about the senate maps i
 
01:16:40.870 --> 01:16:40.880 align:start position:0%
think without torturing things terribly
 
01:16:42.149 --> 01:16:42.159 align:start position:0%
there might be
 
01:16:44.070 --> 01:16:44.080 align:start position:0%
safe senate districts for either
 
01:16:47.189 --> 01:16:47.199 align:start position:0%
republicans or democrats
 
01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:49.600 align:start position:0%
but we we ought to be able to manage it
 
01:16:51.990 --> 01:16:52.000 align:start position:0%
at least for the executive council in in
 
01:16:54.630 --> 01:16:54.640 align:start position:0%
in our discussion today
 
01:16:55.590 --> 01:16:55.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:16:59.110 --> 01:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
further questions for ms tentarelli
 
01:17:01.510 --> 01:17:01.520 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much
 
01:17:03.669 --> 01:17:03.679 align:start position:0%

whole bunch of others oh all right with
 
01:17:42.790 --> 01:17:42.800 align:start position:0%

we don't have that many so
 
01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:48.390 align:start position:0%
we don't have that many so
um

01:17:48.390 --> 01:17:48.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:17:50.709 --> 01:17:50.719 align:start position:0%

01:17:52.149 --> 01:17:52.159 align:start position:0%
that's fine right now because people
 
01:17:56.310 --> 01:17:56.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:59.030 --> 01:17:59.040 align:start position:0%
oh mapathon excuse me i have fair maps

i could ask some questions about fair
 
01:18:08.709 --> 01:18:08.719 align:start position:0%

chair griffin and members of the house
 
01:18:15.270 --> 01:18:15.280 align:start position:0%
special committee on redistricting my
 
01:18:17.110 --> 01:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
name is sarah lobdell and i'm a voter in
 
01:18:18.630 --> 01:18:18.640 align:start position:0%
keene new hampshire
 
01:18:20.470 --> 01:18:20.480 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my testimony i'm
 
01:18:23.830 --> 01:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
going to speak to sb 240 and 241
 
01:18:25.830 --> 01:18:25.840 align:start position:0%
specifically as they impact keene and
 
01:18:27.430 --> 01:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
cheshire county
 
01:18:30.310 --> 01:18:30.320 align:start position:0%
and i want to start off my sb 240 senate
 
01:18:34.790 --> 01:18:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:37.590 --> 01:18:37.600 align:start position:0%
roses are red violets are blue new
 
01:18:39.990 --> 01:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire is purple these maps should be
 
01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:41.110 align:start position:0%
hampshire is purple these maps should be
too

01:18:41.110 --> 01:18:41.120 align:start position:0%
too
 
01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:42.790 align:start position:0%
too
um

01:18:42.790 --> 01:18:42.800 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:18:45.990 --> 01:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
so if you look at i included a map of
 
01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:46.790 align:start position:0%
so if you look at i included a map of
the

01:18:46.790 --> 01:18:46.800 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:18:49.830 --> 01:18:49.840 align:start position:0%
image of the senate map in my testimony
 
01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:53.360 align:start position:0%
and on this map keene is in district 10
 
01:18:55.350 --> 01:18:55.360 align:start position:0%
and based on the mapathon's analysis
 
01:18:57.990 --> 01:18:58.000 align:start position:0%
district 10 leans heavily democrat
 
01:19:00.390 --> 01:19:00.400 align:start position:0%
so this means in district 10 that the
 
01:19:02.470 --> 01:19:02.480 align:start position:0%
votes and the voices of republicans and
 
01:19:02.480 --> 01:19:04.070 align:start position:0%
votes and the voices of republicans and
independents

01:19:04.070 --> 01:19:04.080 align:start position:0%
independents
 
01:19:05.910 --> 01:19:05.920 align:start position:0%
are outnumbered and essentially
 
01:19:05.920 --> 01:19:07.590 align:start position:0%
are outnumbered and essentially
meaningless

01:19:07.590 --> 01:19:07.600 align:start position:0%
meaningless
 
01:19:09.750 --> 01:19:09.760 align:start position:0%
they won't be able to have a fair shot
 
01:19:11.590 --> 01:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
at electing a candidate that can focus
 
01:19:15.030 --> 01:19:15.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.310 align:start position:0%
 
furthermore

01:19:16.310 --> 01:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
furthermore
 
01:19:17.990 --> 01:19:18.000 align:start position:0%
when districts are centered around
 
01:19:19.830 --> 01:19:19.840 align:start position:0%
non-partisan communities of interest
 
01:19:21.750 --> 01:19:21.760 align:start position:0%
candidates are also able to better meet
 
01:19:24.070 --> 01:19:24.080 align:start position:0%
our needs as constituents
 
01:19:26.310 --> 01:19:26.320 align:start position:0%
communities of interest grouped into
 
01:19:28.070 --> 01:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
districts allow constituents to present
 
01:19:29.830 --> 01:19:29.840 align:start position:0%
a united front to their senator to take
 
01:19:31.830 --> 01:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
action on issues that are unique to
 
01:19:33.590 --> 01:19:33.600 align:start position:0%
their communities
 
01:19:37.030 --> 01:19:37.040 align:start position:0%
so for sb240 keen is in district 10
 
01:19:39.030 --> 01:19:39.040 align:start position:0%
that is crisscrossed across a whole
 
01:19:43.910 --> 01:19:43.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:19:46.870 --> 01:19:46.880 align:start position:0%
let's see oh yeah okay so
 
01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:48.560 align:start position:0%
lots of towns near keene are actually
 
01:19:50.149 --> 01:19:50.159 align:start position:0%
split up into different districts in
 
01:19:52.070 --> 01:19:52.080 align:start position:0%
cheshire county so i have friends who
 
01:19:53.910 --> 01:19:53.920 align:start position:0%
live in winchester which is district 9
 
01:19:55.669 --> 01:19:55.679 align:start position:0%
on sb240
 
01:19:57.669 --> 01:19:57.679 align:start position:0%
they go to work in keene they attend
 
01:20:00.229 --> 01:20:00.239 align:start position:0%
school in keene they shop in keene
 
01:20:01.669 --> 01:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
i would argue that these folks probably
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
have more in common
 
01:20:05.189 --> 01:20:05.199 align:start position:0%
and would be better represented by a
 
01:20:05.199 --> 01:20:06.149 align:start position:0%
and would be better represented by a
senator

01:20:06.149 --> 01:20:06.159 align:start position:0%
senator
 
01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:08.320 align:start position:0%
uh who represents them in winchester and
 
01:20:10.310 --> 01:20:10.320 align:start position:0%
keane at the same time
 
01:20:11.750 --> 01:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
rather than grouping
 
01:20:13.430 --> 01:20:13.440 align:start position:0%
keene in district 9 and folks in
 
01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:16.840 align:start position:0%
surrounding towns in district 8 or 9.
 
01:20:21.189 --> 01:20:21.199 align:start position:0%
um so on sb 240 um overall message i
 
01:20:23.669 --> 01:20:23.679 align:start position:0%
urge the committee to please oppose 240
 
01:20:25.830 --> 01:20:25.840 align:start position:0%
um and amend the senate districts to be
 
01:20:27.830 --> 01:20:27.840 align:start position:0%
more competitive and centered around
 
01:20:29.510 --> 01:20:29.520 align:start position:0%
communities of interest like high school
 
01:20:29.520 --> 01:20:30.790 align:start position:0%
communities of interest like high school
saus

01:20:30.790 --> 01:20:30.800 align:start position:0%
saus
 
01:20:34.790 --> 01:20:34.800 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:37.110 --> 01:20:37.120 align:start position:0%
um and then
 
01:20:39.910 --> 01:20:39.920 align:start position:0%
uh 241 my name is sarah lovdell i'm a
 
01:20:41.270 --> 01:20:41.280 align:start position:0%
voter in keene new hampshire thank you
 
01:20:43.110 --> 01:20:43.120 align:start position:0%
for taking my testimony
 
01:20:45.510 --> 01:20:45.520 align:start position:0%
again i'm going to speak to how sb 241
 
01:20:50.070 --> 01:20:50.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:52.070 --> 01:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
so again when districts are competitive
 
01:20:53.590 --> 01:20:53.600 align:start position:0%
candidates must appeal to a wide range
 
01:20:55.590 --> 01:20:55.600 align:start position:0%
of voters on the issues
 
01:20:57.350 --> 01:20:57.360 align:start position:0%
and candidates are therefore more likely
 
01:20:59.350 --> 01:20:59.360 align:start position:0%
to serve their constituents needs
 
01:21:02.709 --> 01:21:02.719 align:start position:0%
so on sb 241 king is in district 2 with
 
01:21:04.709 --> 01:21:04.719 align:start position:0%
a number of democrat-leaning towns
 
01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:06.639 align:start position:0%
making it again more likely that a
 
01:21:08.310 --> 01:21:08.320 align:start position:0%
democrat will be elected
 
01:21:10.149 --> 01:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
and that the votes of republicans and
 
01:21:10.159 --> 01:21:11.750 align:start position:0%
and that the votes of republicans and
independents

01:21:11.750 --> 01:21:11.760 align:start position:0%
independents
 
01:21:13.350 --> 01:21:13.360 align:start position:0%
will be meaningless as they'll be
 
01:21:13.360 --> 01:21:14.950 align:start position:0%
will be meaningless as they'll be
outnumbered

01:21:14.950 --> 01:21:14.960 align:start position:0%
outnumbered
 
01:21:16.629 --> 01:21:16.639 align:start position:0%
all voters should have a fair shot at
 
01:21:18.229 --> 01:21:18.239 align:start position:0%
electing candidates that can serve their
 
01:21:18.239 --> 01:21:20.310 align:start position:0%
electing candidates that can serve their
needs

01:21:20.310 --> 01:21:20.320 align:start position:0%
needs
 
01:21:22.870 --> 01:21:22.880 align:start position:0%
so on the back of this testimony i have
 
01:21:24.709 --> 01:21:24.719 align:start position:0%
the minorities proposal and the
 
01:21:25.910 --> 01:21:25.920 align:start position:0%
mapathons proposal for your
 
01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:27.510 align:start position:0%
mapathons proposal for your
consideration

01:21:27.510 --> 01:21:27.520 align:start position:0%
consideration
 
01:21:29.590 --> 01:21:29.600 align:start position:0%
the mapathon's proposal
 
01:21:29.600 --> 01:21:31.110 align:start position:0%
the mapathon's proposal
um

01:21:31.110 --> 01:21:31.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:33.430 --> 01:21:33.440 align:start position:0%
well both the mapathon minority proposal
 
01:21:34.950 --> 01:21:34.960 align:start position:0%
do a better job at making districts
 
01:21:38.149 --> 01:21:38.159 align:start position:0%
competitive especially where keane lies
 
01:21:38.159 --> 01:21:39.430 align:start position:0%
competitive especially where keane lies
and

01:21:39.430 --> 01:21:39.440 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:21:43.669 --> 01:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
the last thing i want to say on 241
 
01:21:45.510 --> 01:21:45.520 align:start position:0%
is that i believe i heard senator gray
 
01:21:47.830 --> 01:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
earlier say that deviations of around
 
01:21:49.510 --> 01:21:49.520 align:start position:0%
two or less
 
01:21:51.910 --> 01:21:51.920 align:start position:0%
is what he was looking for and so
 
01:21:53.110 --> 01:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
if you could please consider the
 
01:21:55.030 --> 01:21:55.040 align:start position:0%
mapathon proposal the mapathon's
 
01:21:57.270 --> 01:21:57.280 align:start position:0%
proposal have a population deviation of
 
01:21:59.910 --> 01:21:59.920 align:start position:0%
2.47 so that's that's pretty close to
 
01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:00.629 align:start position:0%
2.47 so that's that's pretty close to
the

01:22:00.629 --> 01:22:00.639 align:start position:0%
the
 
01:22:03.750 --> 01:22:03.760 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:05.990 --> 01:22:06.000 align:start position:0%
uh thank you for your time please oppose
 
01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:08.800 align:start position:0%
and amend sb241 to be more competitive
 
01:22:10.629 --> 01:22:10.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you and thank you for
 
01:22:13.590 --> 01:22:13.600 align:start position:0%
that comparison to the uh
 
01:22:15.270 --> 01:22:15.280 align:start position:0%
mapathon map
 
01:22:16.950 --> 01:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
representative mcgee
 
01:22:18.550 --> 01:22:18.560 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chairwoman and thank you
 
01:22:20.070 --> 01:22:20.080 align:start position:0%
for taking my question
 
01:22:22.149 --> 01:22:22.159 align:start position:0%
um as i hear you speak and you appear to
 
01:22:24.790 --> 01:22:24.800 align:start position:0%
be a young voter
 
01:22:26.310 --> 01:22:26.320 align:start position:0%
uh as i hear you speak about your
 
01:22:27.510 --> 01:22:27.520 align:start position:0%
district and you're concerned you're
 
01:22:31.910 --> 01:22:31.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:34.550 --> 01:22:34.560 align:start position:0%
it's like defining woman i would not go
 
01:22:34.560 --> 01:22:36.310 align:start position:0%
it's like defining woman i would not go
there

01:22:36.310 --> 01:22:36.320 align:start position:0%
there
 
01:22:40.149 --> 01:22:40.159 align:start position:0%
um okay so my question is uh
 
01:22:41.990 --> 01:22:42.000 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about competitive
 
01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:43.110 align:start position:0%
when you're talking about competitive
districts

01:22:43.110 --> 01:22:43.120 align:start position:0%
districts
 
01:22:46.790 --> 01:22:46.800 align:start position:0%
and you're outlining a concern for
 
01:22:48.790 --> 01:22:48.800 align:start position:0%
uh disenfranchising certain voters
 
01:22:50.070 --> 01:22:50.080 align:start position:0%
because their vote won't count if a
 
01:22:51.590 --> 01:22:51.600 align:start position:0%
district is going to swing one way or
 
01:22:52.629 --> 01:22:52.639 align:start position:0%
the other
 
01:22:54.149 --> 01:22:54.159 align:start position:0%
then you're going to feel like you know
 
01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:55.360 align:start position:0%
you voting a different way doesn't
 
01:22:56.470 --> 01:22:56.480 align:start position:0%
really matter
 
01:22:58.870 --> 01:22:58.880 align:start position:0%
does that in your opinion
 
01:23:01.270 --> 01:23:01.280 align:start position:0%
contribute to voter apathy among people
 
01:23:03.590 --> 01:23:03.600 align:start position:0%
who are coming out to vote and turn out
 
01:23:05.350 --> 01:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
in voting
 
01:23:08.470 --> 01:23:08.480 align:start position:0%
um so your question is if if a district
 
01:23:10.709 --> 01:23:10.719 align:start position:0%
leans heavily one way do
 
01:23:12.149 --> 01:23:12.159 align:start position:0%
well folks not show up to vote because
 
01:23:13.669 --> 01:23:13.679 align:start position:0%
they think their vote doesn't matter is
 
01:23:15.510 --> 01:23:15.520 align:start position:0%
that yep um
 
01:23:17.669 --> 01:23:17.679 align:start position:0%
i am not an expert on that but i would
 
01:23:19.910 --> 01:23:19.920 align:start position:0%
say my my hunch as a young voter would
 
01:23:22.950 --> 01:23:22.960 align:start position:0%
be that yes that folks um
 
01:23:24.870 --> 01:23:24.880 align:start position:0%
often a lot of people that i know don't
 
01:23:26.070 --> 01:23:26.080 align:start position:0%
vote in the primaries because they're
 
01:23:27.430 --> 01:23:27.440 align:start position:0%
like oh the people who really care about
 
01:23:28.470 --> 01:23:28.480 align:start position:0%
these issues will vote and then we'll
 
01:23:30.310 --> 01:23:30.320 align:start position:0%
vote later in the general and so then in
 
01:23:33.189 --> 01:23:33.199 align:start position:0%
the general um if you feel like you're
 
01:23:34.950 --> 01:23:34.960 align:start position:0%
gonna show up but the other candidate
 
01:23:34.960 --> 01:23:35.990 align:start position:0%
gonna show up but the other candidate
already

01:23:35.990 --> 01:23:36.000 align:start position:0%
already
 
01:23:37.350 --> 01:23:37.360 align:start position:0%
you're already outnumbered in terms of
 
01:23:39.189 --> 01:23:39.199 align:start position:0%
voters for the other candidate people
 
01:23:41.669 --> 01:23:41.679 align:start position:0%
yeah might not show up
 
01:23:41.679 --> 01:23:42.550 align:start position:0%
yeah might not show up
and

01:23:42.550 --> 01:23:42.560 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:23:45.270 --> 01:23:45.280 align:start position:0%
follow up the other contin the other uh
 
01:23:46.950 --> 01:23:46.960 align:start position:0%
contributing issue that i can see that i
 
01:23:50.709 --> 01:23:50.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:23:53.350 --> 01:23:53.360 align:start position:0%
is whether a safe district
 
01:23:55.360 --> 01:23:55.370 align:start position:0%
also contributes to
 
01:23:55.370 --> 01:23:59.189 align:start position:0%
also contributes to
[Music]

01:23:59.189 --> 01:23:59.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:01.600 align:start position:0%
not having the elected person be
 
01:24:05.189 --> 01:24:05.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:24:05.199 --> 01:24:06.310 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:24:06.310 --> 01:24:06.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:24:08.790 --> 01:24:08.800 align:start position:0%
so if yeah if a district is safe
 
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:11.600 align:start position:0%
will the um the senator or executive
 
01:24:13.669 --> 01:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
council not be responsible to all voters
 
01:24:15.830 --> 01:24:15.840 align:start position:0%
um that's yeah definitely potential if
 
01:24:17.430 --> 01:24:17.440 align:start position:0%
they feel like they only need to focus
 
01:24:19.510 --> 01:24:19.520 align:start position:0%
on like one tiny chunk of their
 
01:24:21.990 --> 01:24:22.000 align:start position:0%
constituents and meet their needs and
 
01:24:24.070 --> 01:24:24.080 align:start position:0%
maybe that's like the biggest city in
 
01:24:26.149 --> 01:24:26.159 align:start position:0%
their really sprawly district they yeah
 
01:24:27.910 --> 01:24:27.920 align:start position:0%
they might not focus on all of the other
 
01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.350 align:start position:0%
they might not focus on all of the other
constituents

01:24:29.350 --> 01:24:29.360 align:start position:0%
constituents
 
01:24:30.470 --> 01:24:30.480 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:24:32.149 --> 01:24:32.159 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from committee
 
01:24:32.159 --> 01:24:33.270 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions from committee

01:24:53.189 --> 01:24:53.199 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair members of the
 
01:24:54.790 --> 01:24:54.800 align:start position:0%
committee for the opportunity to testify
 
01:24:56.310 --> 01:24:56.320 align:start position:0%
today my name is frank knack i'm the
 
01:24:58.070 --> 01:24:58.080 align:start position:0%
policy director with the aclu of new
 
01:24:58.080 --> 01:24:59.669 align:start position:0%
policy director with the aclu of new
hampshire

01:24:59.669 --> 01:24:59.679 align:start position:0%
hampshire
 
01:25:02.390 --> 01:25:02.400 align:start position:0%
and we are here in opposition to both sp
 
01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:05.440 align:start position:0%
240 and sb 241
 
01:25:08.550 --> 01:25:08.560 align:start position:0%
um starting with sb 240 so we wanted to
 
01:25:10.470 --> 01:25:10.480 align:start position:0%
make sure that we could provide
 
01:25:13.350 --> 01:25:13.360 align:start position:0%
an independent data-driven analysis of
 
01:25:14.550 --> 01:25:14.560 align:start position:0%
of the map
 
01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:17.120 align:start position:0%
in the senate uh proposal
 
01:25:19.189 --> 01:25:19.199 align:start position:0%
and so consultant contracted with an
 
01:25:21.350 --> 01:25:21.360 align:start position:0%
outside firm to provide that independent
 
01:25:23.750 --> 01:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
analysis and we can conclude from their
 
01:25:25.910 --> 01:25:25.920 align:start position:0%
analysis uh that this is in fact a
 
01:25:28.149 --> 01:25:28.159 align:start position:0%
partisan gerrymander
 
01:25:29.669 --> 01:25:29.679 align:start position:0%
many of the points i wanted to discuss
 
01:25:31.590 --> 01:25:31.600 align:start position:0%
have already been uh lifted up but i'll
 
01:25:34.229 --> 01:25:34.239 align:start position:0%
just point out a few things in addition
 
01:25:38.149 --> 01:25:38.159 align:start position:0%
um from the findings uh we conclude that
 
01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:40.960 align:start position:0%
the partisan lead for democratic leaning
 
01:25:44.070 --> 01:25:44.080 align:start position:0%
districts is plus 9.11
 
01:25:46.870 --> 01:25:46.880 align:start position:0%
the partisan lien for uh gop leading
 
01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:50.239 align:start position:0%
districts is point uh 5.04 so a
 
01:25:52.709 --> 01:25:52.719 align:start position:0%
substantial difference there
 
01:25:54.709 --> 01:25:54.719 align:start position:0%
and i also think it's important to note
 
01:25:58.470 --> 01:25:58.480 align:start position:0%
um the the the um the scope or the size
 
01:26:01.189 --> 01:26:01.199 align:start position:0%
of the partisan lien is is much much
 
01:26:03.669 --> 01:26:03.679 align:start position:0%
greater for democratic leaning districts
 
01:26:05.430 --> 01:26:05.440 align:start position:0%
than for republican leaning districts so
 
01:26:07.270 --> 01:26:07.280 align:start position:0%
in terms of their their packing ability
 
01:26:09.669 --> 01:26:09.679 align:start position:0%
was substantial on democrats
 
01:26:09.679 --> 01:26:10.629 align:start position:0%
was substantial on democrats
um

01:26:10.629 --> 01:26:10.639 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:26:12.870 --> 01:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
i'll point out that in ford there was
 
01:26:15.510 --> 01:26:15.520 align:start position:0%
only four districts where it was above
 
01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:17.600 align:start position:0%
10 points all four of those were
 
01:26:19.590 --> 01:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
democratic leading districts
 
01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:20.960 align:start position:0%
and in two of those it was not only
 
01:26:23.590 --> 01:26:23.600 align:start position:0%
above 10 points it was actually 19 above
 
01:26:25.350 --> 01:26:25.360 align:start position:0%
19 points
 
01:26:26.790 --> 01:26:26.800 align:start position:0%
and also point out the highest
 
01:26:29.750 --> 01:26:29.760 align:start position:0%
republican pac district was only 9.4 so
 
01:26:31.510 --> 01:26:31.520 align:start position:0%
more than double
 
01:26:33.350 --> 01:26:33.360 align:start position:0%
so i think it's important
 
01:26:34.950 --> 01:26:34.960 align:start position:0%
that voters pick
 
01:26:36.470 --> 01:26:36.480 align:start position:0%
their politicians and not the other way
 
01:26:39.350 --> 01:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
around and with the senate map
 
01:26:42.310 --> 01:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
the cinema fails to meet that basic test
 
01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
on the um on the executive council we
 
01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:48.560 align:start position:0%
are because there's a new proposal that
 
01:26:50.470 --> 01:26:50.480 align:start position:0%
that's been brought we are still having
 
01:26:52.470 --> 01:26:52.480 align:start position:0%
that analysis conducted
 
01:26:53.750 --> 01:26:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh so i can just speak to the
 
01:26:55.510 --> 01:26:55.520 align:start position:0%
preliminary findings that we have which
 
01:26:58.149 --> 01:26:58.159 align:start position:0%
is that i think has been as alluded to
 
01:26:59.750 --> 01:26:59.760 align:start position:0%
we have serious concerns particularly
 
01:27:01.830 --> 01:27:01.840 align:start position:0%
with district 2 and in the extreme
 
01:27:03.750 --> 01:27:03.760 align:start position:0%
packing there and i also think it's
 
01:27:06.310 --> 01:27:06.320 align:start position:0%
important to recognize um from reports
 
01:27:08.470 --> 01:27:08.480 align:start position:0%
that um it is our understanding that
 
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:10.320 align:start position:0%
executive council members actually asked
 
01:27:11.990 --> 01:27:12.000 align:start position:0%
for this and so i think you can't get a
 
01:27:13.750 --> 01:27:13.760 align:start position:0%
better example in that case
 
01:27:15.430 --> 01:27:15.440 align:start position:0%
of politicians picking their voters and
 
01:27:17.350 --> 01:27:17.360 align:start position:0%
not the other way around
 
01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:18.550 align:start position:0%
not the other way around
so

01:27:18.550 --> 01:27:18.560 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:27:20.550 --> 01:27:20.560 align:start position:0%
i will be circulating the additional
 
01:27:22.709 --> 01:27:22.719 align:start position:0%
analysis as soon as we get it back to
 
01:27:24.070 --> 01:27:24.080 align:start position:0%
the full committee so that you all have
 
01:27:26.470 --> 01:27:26.480 align:start position:0%
it in front of you as well as the uh the
 
01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:28.560 align:start position:0%
original analysis that i mentioned happy
 
01:27:30.470 --> 01:27:30.480 align:start position:0%
to answer any questions thank you before
 
01:27:31.750 --> 01:27:31.760 align:start position:0%
i recognize committee members you
 
01:27:33.270 --> 01:27:33.280 align:start position:0%
mentioned that you retained a firm to do
 
01:27:35.030 --> 01:27:35.040 align:start position:0%
the analysis you do you have anything in
 
01:27:37.189 --> 01:27:37.199 align:start position:0%
writing today for us for that analysis
 
01:27:39.189 --> 01:27:39.199 align:start position:0%
yes i'll be circulating so um it was
 
01:27:41.510 --> 01:27:41.520 align:start position:0%
flow analytics um and the reason i did
 
01:27:44.229 --> 01:27:44.239 align:start position:0%
not provide before the hearing is we're
 
01:27:46.149 --> 01:27:46.159 align:start position:0%
still waiting for the updated executive
 
01:27:47.990 --> 01:27:48.000 align:start position:0%
council and so i wanted to make sure i
 
01:27:49.510 --> 01:27:49.520 align:start position:0%
could send them together to the full
 
01:27:51.510 --> 01:27:51.520 align:start position:0%
committee all right and so flow
 
01:27:53.350 --> 01:27:53.360 align:start position:0%
analytics is the firm that you retained
 
01:27:56.709 --> 01:27:56.719 align:start position:0%
yes and when did the senate pass the
 
01:27:58.709 --> 01:27:58.719 align:start position:0%
senate and the executive council maps do
 
01:28:00.709 --> 01:28:00.719 align:start position:0%
you recall that date i believe it was
 
01:28:03.030 --> 01:28:03.040 align:start position:0%
the end of january around the end of
 
01:28:05.189 --> 01:28:05.199 align:start position:0%
january early february i don't think
 
01:28:06.709 --> 01:28:06.719 align:start position:0%
that's right i'm just going to look to
 
01:28:09.669 --> 01:28:09.679 align:start position:0%
olivia do you know have the date
 
01:28:10.950 --> 01:28:10.960 align:start position:0%
all right olivia what do you think of
 
01:28:12.790 --> 01:28:12.800 align:start position:0%
february maybe but if you could let me
 
01:28:14.070 --> 01:28:14.080 align:start position:0%
know the dates they were actually
 
01:28:15.910 --> 01:28:15.920 align:start position:0%
approved by the senate that would be
 
01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:18.709 align:start position:0%
approved by the senate that would be
terrific

01:28:18.709 --> 01:28:18.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:20.390 --> 01:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
all right questions from committee
 
01:28:22.790 --> 01:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
members representative lane
 
01:28:25.270 --> 01:28:25.280 align:start position:0%
uh thank you madam chair um since we are
 
01:28:27.830 --> 01:28:27.840 align:start position:0%
probably going to vote on these today
 
01:28:29.510 --> 01:28:29.520 align:start position:0%
could you please provide us with the
 
01:28:32.390 --> 01:28:32.400 align:start position:0%
information as soon as possible
 
01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:34.800 align:start position:0%
perhaps before the end of this hearing
 
01:28:36.629 --> 01:28:36.639 align:start position:0%
so that we can have the advantage of
 
01:28:38.629 --> 01:28:38.639 align:start position:0%
looking at it you can just email it to
 
01:28:39.910 --> 01:28:39.920 align:start position:0%
the election law committee through the
 
01:28:41.990 --> 01:28:42.000 align:start position:0%
website if you've got anything online if
 
01:28:45.110 --> 01:28:45.120 align:start position:0%
 
01:28:47.669 --> 01:28:47.679 align:start position:0%
excuse me sorry i'm i'm sorry
 
01:28:49.830 --> 01:28:49.840 align:start position:0%

so outraged
by

01:30:05.430 --> 01:30:05.440 align:start position:0%
by
 
01:30:08.390 --> 01:30:08.400 align:start position:0%
senator gray's testimony that he could
 
01:30:12.149 --> 01:30:12.159 align:start position:0%
assert that he was um
 
01:30:14.070 --> 01:30:14.080 align:start position:0%
just trying to count to 13 i think he
 
01:30:19.189 --> 01:30:19.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:20.880 align:start position:0%
so i um
 
01:30:23.110 --> 01:30:23.120 align:start position:0%
i'll testify first on
 
01:30:24.550 --> 01:30:24.560 align:start position:0%
senate bill
 
01:30:26.950 --> 01:30:26.960 align:start position:0%
241 which i do ask you all to vote
 
01:30:26.960 --> 01:30:28.470 align:start position:0%
241 which i do ask you all to vote
against

01:30:28.470 --> 01:30:28.480 align:start position:0%
against
 
01:30:28.480 --> 01:30:32.550 align:start position:0%
against
um

01:30:32.550 --> 01:30:32.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:34.639 align:start position:0%
i'd live in where
 
01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:36.880 align:start position:0%
i've taught in the ware school district
 
01:30:39.669 --> 01:30:39.679 align:start position:0%
and also in the henniker school district
 
01:30:39.679 --> 01:30:40.870 align:start position:0%
and also in the henniker school district
and

01:30:40.870 --> 01:30:40.880 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:30:43.350 --> 01:30:43.360 align:start position:0%
i would like a senator who
 
01:30:45.510 --> 01:30:45.520 align:start position:0%
would be familiar with
 
01:30:47.110 --> 01:30:47.120 align:start position:0%
the school districts
 
01:30:49.669 --> 01:30:49.679 align:start position:0%
and care about their interests
 
01:30:51.430 --> 01:30:51.440 align:start position:0%
and so having them in the same district
 
01:30:53.750 --> 01:30:53.760 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me
 
01:30:53.760 --> 01:30:54.030 align:start position:0%
makes sense to me
um

01:30:54.030 --> 01:30:54.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:30:54.040 --> 01:30:55.990 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:30:55.990 --> 01:30:56.000 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:30:57.510 --> 01:30:57.520 align:start position:0%
what do
 
01:30:59.750 --> 01:30:59.760 align:start position:0%
i as a resident of where and my
 
01:31:02.390 --> 01:31:02.400 align:start position:0%
neighbors and friends in dunbarton have
 
01:31:04.550 --> 01:31:04.560 align:start position:0%
in common with those communities way
 
01:31:06.310 --> 01:31:06.320 align:start position:0%
over on the connecticut
 
01:31:06.320 --> 01:31:07.669 align:start position:0%
over on the connecticut
river

01:31:07.669 --> 01:31:07.679 align:start position:0%
river
 
01:31:12.149 --> 01:31:12.159 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:14.790 --> 01:31:14.800 align:start position:0%
and many republican friends of mine in
 
01:31:14.800 --> 01:31:16.229 align:start position:0%
and many republican friends of mine in
ware where

01:31:16.229 --> 01:31:16.239 align:start position:0%
ware where
 
01:31:18.590 --> 01:31:18.600 align:start position:0%
i feel would be
 
01:31:20.390 --> 01:31:20.400 align:start position:0%
disenfranchised by
 
01:31:23.910 --> 01:31:23.920 align:start position:0%
 
01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:25.910 align:start position:0%
 
because

01:31:25.910 --> 01:31:25.920 align:start position:0%
because
 
01:31:28.390 --> 01:31:28.400 align:start position:0%
there's no real point in voting
 
01:31:30.709 --> 01:31:30.719 align:start position:0%
for each individual with it being such a
 
01:31:33.590 --> 01:31:33.600 align:start position:0%
certain thing that
 
01:31:35.030 --> 01:31:35.040 align:start position:0%
the republican
 
01:31:36.950 --> 01:31:36.960 align:start position:0%
candidate would win
 
01:31:40.629 --> 01:31:40.639 align:start position:0%
i also wonder if ruth ward would really
 
01:31:43.590 --> 01:31:43.600 align:start position:0%
want to have to travel that distance
 
01:31:45.110 --> 01:31:45.120 align:start position:0%
in representing
 
01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:47.280 align:start position:0%
her district
 
01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:47.550 align:start position:0%
her district
um

01:31:47.550 --> 01:31:47.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:47.560 --> 01:31:49.189 align:start position:0%
um
[Music]

01:31:49.189 --> 01:31:49.199 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:31:50.870 --> 01:31:50.880 align:start position:0%
at our town election
 
01:31:50.880 --> 01:31:51.669 align:start position:0%
at our town election
um

01:31:51.669 --> 01:31:51.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:31:54.310 --> 01:31:54.320 align:start position:0%
on the warrant was the fair maps
 
01:31:55.910 --> 01:31:55.920 align:start position:0%
proposal and
 
01:31:58.950 --> 01:31:58.960 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly we voted for it
 
01:31:58.960 --> 01:31:59.910 align:start position:0%
overwhelmingly we voted for it
um

01:31:59.910 --> 01:31:59.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:32:02.070 --> 01:32:02.080 align:start position:0%
can this committee reasonably assert
 
01:32:04.950 --> 01:32:04.960 align:start position:0%
that the proposed senate district maps
 
01:32:06.629 --> 01:32:06.639 align:start position:0%
comply with
 
01:32:08.310 --> 01:32:08.320 align:start position:0%
fair criteria
 
01:32:13.669 --> 01:32:13.679 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:16.870 --> 01:32:16.880 align:start position:0%
as for sb 241
 
01:32:18.629 --> 01:32:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh i was
 
01:32:20.950 --> 01:32:20.960 align:start position:0%
working with others in the town to put
 
01:32:23.189 --> 01:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
together a candidate's night and we
 
01:32:26.390 --> 01:32:26.400 align:start position:0%
hoped to include executive council
 
01:32:28.550 --> 01:32:28.560 align:start position:0%
candidates dave wheeler and deborah
 
01:32:30.709 --> 01:32:30.719 align:start position:0%
pignatelli at the time
 
01:32:33.669 --> 01:32:33.679 align:start position:0%
and when i called deborah pignatelli
 
01:32:35.830 --> 01:32:35.840 align:start position:0%
she said i'd love to come
 
01:32:39.030 --> 01:32:39.040 align:start position:0%
but i really have to focus on nashua
 
01:32:41.270 --> 01:32:41.280 align:start position:0%
that's where i
 
01:32:42.870 --> 01:32:42.880 align:start position:0%
you know get the greatest bang for the
 
01:32:46.149 --> 01:32:46.159 align:start position:0%
buck i'm not going to
 
01:32:48.709 --> 01:32:48.719 align:start position:0%
gain enough votes in where to make it
 
01:32:50.149 --> 01:32:50.159 align:start position:0%
worth my while
 
01:32:52.830 --> 01:32:52.840 align:start position:0%
to come up that was very
 
01:32:55.510 --> 01:32:55.520 align:start position:0%
dismaying to me it seems that if
 
01:32:58.149 --> 01:32:58.159 align:start position:0%
districts were more balanced
 
01:32:58.159 --> 01:32:59.510 align:start position:0%
districts were more balanced
than

01:32:59.510 --> 01:32:59.520 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:33:01.590 --> 01:33:01.600 align:start position:0%
those few votes that she could get in
 
01:33:03.430 --> 01:33:03.440 align:start position:0%
the rural parts of
 
01:33:05.830 --> 01:33:05.840 align:start position:0%
of that executive council district and
 
01:33:08.870 --> 01:33:08.880 align:start position:0%
this was of course the old map um
 
01:33:10.470 --> 01:33:10.480 align:start position:0%
it would have been more likely to see
 
01:33:12.790 --> 01:33:12.800 align:start position:0%
her get to know her and for her to get
 
01:33:14.229 --> 01:33:14.239 align:start position:0%
to know them
 
01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:15.920 align:start position:0%
so um
 
01:33:17.110 --> 01:33:17.120 align:start position:0%
it's a shame
 
01:33:17.120 --> 01:33:18.149 align:start position:0%
it's a shame
that

01:33:18.149 --> 01:33:18.159 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:33:20.229 --> 01:33:20.239 align:start position:0%
for expediency
 
01:33:23.189 --> 01:33:23.199 align:start position:0%
she felt the need to focus on nashua
 
01:33:26.229 --> 01:33:26.239 align:start position:0%
pretty much to the exclusion of rural
 
01:33:26.239 --> 01:33:28.149 align:start position:0%
pretty much to the exclusion of rural
communities

01:33:28.149 --> 01:33:28.159 align:start position:0%
communities
 
01:33:30.149 --> 01:33:30.159 align:start position:0%
so please vote against these
 
01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:32.080 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered maps
 
01:33:33.110 --> 01:33:33.120 align:start position:0%
and give us
 
01:33:34.870 --> 01:33:34.880 align:start position:0%
a fair shot
 
01:33:38.310 --> 01:33:38.320 align:start position:0%
and uh make it so that we're all
 
01:33:40.390 --> 01:33:40.400 align:start position:0%
fairly represented
 
01:33:41.750 --> 01:33:41.760 align:start position:0%

01:33:44.870 --> 01:33:44.880 align:start position:0%

your comments of concern about the rural
districts

districts
 
01:34:04.470 --> 01:34:04.480 align:start position:0%
as i represent a rural district myself
 
01:34:07.910 --> 01:34:07.920 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that the
 
01:34:10.870 --> 01:34:10.880 align:start position:0%
council maps that as drawn that we would
 
01:34:12.629 --> 01:34:12.639 align:start position:0%
be voting on today
 
01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:14.960 align:start position:0%
do an extreme disservice to north
 
01:34:18.709 --> 01:34:18.719 align:start position:0%
country voters because
 
01:34:18.719 --> 01:34:19.580 align:start position:0%
country voters because
both

01:34:19.580 --> 01:34:19.590 align:start position:0%
both
 
01:34:19.590 --> 01:34:22.229 align:start position:0%

[Music]

01:34:22.229 --> 01:34:22.239 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:34:24.149 --> 01:34:24.159 align:start position:0%
one and two
 
01:34:27.750 --> 01:34:27.760 align:start position:0%
also contain large population centers
 
01:34:32.950 --> 01:34:32.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:36.310 --> 01:34:36.320 align:start position:0%
those may be the focus of candidates to
 
01:34:39.669 --> 01:34:39.679 align:start position:0%
the exclusion of the entire north
 
01:34:42.709 --> 01:34:42.719 align:start position:0%
country as the maps are drawn
 
01:34:45.750 --> 01:34:45.760 align:start position:0%
from my limited experience down in
 
01:34:47.830 --> 01:34:47.840 align:start position:0%
district five i would be afraid that
 
01:34:50.390 --> 01:34:50.400 align:start position:0%
would be the same situation
 
01:34:51.669 --> 01:34:51.679 align:start position:0%
thank you sir
 
01:34:55.830 --> 01:34:55.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:57.189 --> 01:34:57.199 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much for
 
01:34:59.030 --> 01:34:59.040 align:start position:0%
coming mr erickson and we have your
 
01:35:01.830 --> 01:35:01.840 align:start position:0%
written testimony for the record
 
01:35:03.910 --> 01:35:03.920 align:start position:0%
um the last person i have signed up for
 
01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:04.709 align:start position:0%
um the last person i have signed up for
this

01:35:04.709 --> 01:35:04.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:35:06.629 --> 01:35:06.639 align:start position:0%
um if there's anybody else who wanted to
 
01:35:08.229 --> 01:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
speak they need to do a pink art is
 
01:35:10.470 --> 01:35:10.480 align:start position:0%
david andrews i i never know whether to
 
01:35:11.990 --> 01:35:12.000 align:start position:0%
have mr andrews come first with the
 
01:35:14.070 --> 01:35:14.080 align:start position:0%
mapathon or or at last but everybody
 
01:35:16.550 --> 01:35:16.560 align:start position:0%
seemed to know the work you've done so i
 
01:35:18.310 --> 01:35:18.320 align:start position:0%
thought i would let you go last so you
 
01:35:19.750 --> 01:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
could go through everything before we
 
01:35:19.760 --> 01:35:21.189 align:start position:0%
could go through everything before we
break

01:35:21.189 --> 01:35:21.199 align:start position:0%
break
 
01:35:24.229 --> 01:35:24.239 align:start position:0%
welcome welcome back thank you
 
01:35:25.990 --> 01:35:26.000 align:start position:0%
um for the record my name is david
 
01:35:28.629 --> 01:35:28.639 align:start position:0%
andrews i'm from chichester i was the
 
01:35:34.229 --> 01:35:34.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:35:36.149 --> 01:35:36.159 align:start position:0%
redistricting is
 
01:35:39.189 --> 01:35:39.199 align:start position:0%
one of the most important things
 
01:35:41.270 --> 01:35:41.280 align:start position:0%
that will be undertaken
 
01:35:43.669 --> 01:35:43.679 align:start position:0%
by this body and by the legislature in
 
01:35:46.629 --> 01:35:46.639 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it lasts for 10 years
 
01:35:46.639 --> 01:35:47.669 align:start position:0%
new hampshire it lasts for 10 years
so

01:35:47.669 --> 01:35:47.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:35:49.830 --> 01:35:49.840 align:start position:0%
eight-year-olds now will be voting on
 
01:35:51.590 --> 01:35:51.600 align:start position:0%
these maps
 
01:35:51.600 --> 01:35:52.470 align:start position:0%
these maps
and

01:35:52.470 --> 01:35:52.480 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:35:54.390 --> 01:35:54.400 align:start position:0%
the vote that you're about to take is
 
01:35:56.470 --> 01:35:56.480 align:start position:0%
probably going to be the most important
 
01:36:01.830 --> 01:36:01.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:03.750 --> 01:36:03.760 align:start position:0%
with redistricting
 
01:36:07.350 --> 01:36:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
01:36:07.360 --> 01:36:08.390 align:start position:0%
 
choose

01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
choose
 
01:36:12.709 --> 01:36:12.719 align:start position:0%
who you want to have as your
 
01:36:12.719 --> 01:36:14.070 align:start position:0%
who you want to have as your
representatives

01:36:14.070 --> 01:36:14.080 align:start position:0%
representatives
 
01:36:17.990 --> 01:36:18.000 align:start position:0%
or you can let the voters choose
 
01:36:20.790 --> 01:36:20.800 align:start position:0%
in that
 
01:36:23.510 --> 01:36:23.520 align:start position:0%
it's a lot easier to move one town on a
 
01:36:27.189 --> 01:36:27.199 align:start position:0%
map than it is to swing an electorate
 
01:36:29.910 --> 01:36:29.920 align:start position:0%
by percentage points you know
 
01:36:31.510 --> 01:36:31.520 align:start position:0%
it's much easier
 
01:36:36.310 --> 01:36:36.320 align:start position:0%
to pack your opponents into districts
 
01:36:39.270 --> 01:36:39.280 align:start position:0%
than it is to win over
 
01:36:41.270 --> 01:36:41.280 align:start position:0%
their voters who
 
01:36:43.350 --> 01:36:43.360 align:start position:0%
um usually vote for them
 
01:36:43.360 --> 01:36:44.470 align:start position:0%
um usually vote for them
um

01:36:44.470 --> 01:36:44.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:36:46.790 --> 01:36:46.800 align:start position:0%
there's been a lot of talk today about
 
01:36:49.990 --> 01:36:50.000 align:start position:0%
fair maps and what makes a fair map
 
01:36:52.470 --> 01:36:52.480 align:start position:0%
and it's been difficult for a lot of
 
01:36:55.669 --> 01:36:55.679 align:start position:0%
people um to define this both senator
 
01:36:57.910 --> 01:36:57.920 align:start position:0%
gray and others
 
01:37:00.709 --> 01:37:00.719 align:start position:0%
because we don't have criteria neither
 
01:37:03.189 --> 01:37:03.199 align:start position:0%
this committee nor its counterpart in
 
01:37:06.390 --> 01:37:06.400 align:start position:0%
the senate released criteria if you have
 
01:37:06.400 --> 01:37:07.830 align:start position:0%
the senate released criteria if you have
criteria

01:37:07.830 --> 01:37:07.840 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:37:10.550 --> 01:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
you can look at that and judge maps
 
01:37:12.550 --> 01:37:12.560 align:start position:0%
against each other we've talked about
 
01:37:14.550 --> 01:37:14.560 align:start position:0%
how there's thousands of maps that can
 
01:37:15.669 --> 01:37:15.679 align:start position:0%
be created
 
01:37:17.910 --> 01:37:17.920 align:start position:0%
but each are not equal and if you have
 
01:37:20.709 --> 01:37:20.719 align:start position:0%
criteria you can rank them against each
 
01:37:23.109 --> 01:37:23.119 align:start position:0%
other based on that criteria whether
 
01:37:25.030 --> 01:37:25.040 align:start position:0%
it's population competitiveness
 
01:37:25.040 --> 01:37:26.790 align:start position:0%
it's population competitiveness
compactness

01:37:26.790 --> 01:37:26.800 align:start position:0%
compactness
 
01:37:28.470 --> 01:37:28.480 align:start position:0%
communities of interest any of those
 
01:37:31.510 --> 01:37:31.520 align:start position:0%
things you can then rank those maps and
 
01:37:34.070 --> 01:37:34.080 align:start position:0%
throw out the ones that don't come close
 
01:37:35.990 --> 01:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
on any of those metrics that you decide
 
01:37:38.870 --> 01:37:38.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:41.030 --> 01:37:41.040 align:start position:0%
what we did in the mapathon project was
 
01:37:43.189 --> 01:37:43.199 align:start position:0%
we went out to the voters
 
01:37:45.189 --> 01:37:45.199 align:start position:0%
to cons the residents of new hampshire
 
01:37:48.149 --> 01:37:48.159 align:start position:0%
and asked what are important to you and
 
01:37:50.709 --> 01:37:50.719 align:start position:0%
that's what we got we got a list of you
 
01:37:53.030 --> 01:37:53.040 align:start position:0%
know 63 things that senator gray talked
 
01:37:53.040 --> 01:37:55.590 align:start position:0%
know 63 things that senator gray talked
about

01:37:55.590 --> 01:37:55.600 align:start position:0%
 
01:37:58.070 --> 01:37:58.080 align:start position:0%
that were important to to people
 
01:38:00.310 --> 01:38:00.320 align:start position:0%
then we went back and asked people what
 
01:38:03.270 --> 01:38:03.280 align:start position:0%
what's most important to you you know
 
01:38:05.990 --> 01:38:06.000 align:start position:0%
when we got high school saus
 
01:38:10.229 --> 01:38:10.239 align:start position:0%
local hospitals uh public health regions
 
01:38:12.550 --> 01:38:12.560 align:start position:0%
county lines those things were the most
 
01:38:15.030 --> 01:38:15.040 align:start position:0%
important things to the residents of new
 
01:38:17.590 --> 01:38:17.600 align:start position:0%
hampshire and thus we went forward
 
01:38:20.229 --> 01:38:20.239 align:start position:0%
and mapped according to those
 
01:38:20.239 --> 01:38:21.350 align:start position:0%
and mapped according to those
uh

01:38:21.350 --> 01:38:21.360 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:38:21.360 --> 01:38:22.790 align:start position:0%
uh
criteria

01:38:22.790 --> 01:38:22.800 align:start position:0%
criteria
 
01:38:25.350 --> 01:38:25.360 align:start position:0%
we didn't take competitiveness into
 
01:38:28.790 --> 01:38:28.800 align:start position:0%
account until afterwards i drew hundreds
 
01:38:31.030 --> 01:38:31.040 align:start position:0%
of maps and
 
01:38:34.070 --> 01:38:34.080 align:start position:0%
never did i well
 
01:38:35.270 --> 01:38:35.280 align:start position:0%
never did i
 
01:38:37.510 --> 01:38:37.520 align:start position:0%
use competitiveness as a metric when i
 
01:38:39.189 --> 01:38:39.199 align:start position:0%
was drawing a map that i wanted to put
 
01:38:40.790 --> 01:38:40.800 align:start position:0%
forward i did
 
01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.070 align:start position:0%
forward i did
draw

01:38:42.070 --> 01:38:42.080 align:start position:0%
draw
 
01:38:44.870 --> 01:38:44.880 align:start position:0%
gerrymanders on either side for fun um
 
01:38:46.550 --> 01:38:46.560 align:start position:0%
specifically for the executive council
 
01:38:47.990 --> 01:38:48.000 align:start position:0%
map and
 
01:38:50.310 --> 01:38:50.320 align:start position:0%
remarkably the one that is put forth
 
01:38:52.790 --> 01:38:52.800 align:start position:0%
today looks remarkably similar to the
 
01:38:55.109 --> 01:38:55.119 align:start position:0%
republican gerrymander that i drew
 
01:38:57.750 --> 01:38:57.760 align:start position:0%
probably five days after the 2020 census
 
01:39:00.310 --> 01:39:00.320 align:start position:0%
was released
 
01:39:02.629 --> 01:39:02.639 align:start position:0%
so what i would do would i would draw
 
01:39:04.790 --> 01:39:04.800 align:start position:0%
according to the criteria and then
 
01:39:06.870 --> 01:39:06.880 align:start position:0%
afterwards i would look and see if the
 
01:39:09.430 --> 01:39:09.440 align:start position:0%
competitiveness looked reasonable you
 
01:39:11.830 --> 01:39:11.840 align:start position:0%
know new hampshire being a 50 50 state
 
01:39:13.189 --> 01:39:13.199 align:start position:0%
you would expect
 
01:39:14.950 --> 01:39:14.960 align:start position:0%
you know 12 12
 
01:39:17.350 --> 01:39:17.360 align:start position:0%
or 13 11 something like that in the in
 
01:39:18.790 --> 01:39:18.800 align:start position:0%
the senate districts so that's what i
 
01:39:20.629 --> 01:39:20.639 align:start position:0%
would do i would i would go use the
 
01:39:22.790 --> 01:39:22.800 align:start position:0%
criteria figure out what
 
01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.149 align:start position:0%
criteria figure out what
um

01:39:24.149 --> 01:39:24.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:39:26.470 --> 01:39:26.480 align:start position:0%
a map that met most of the criteria and
 
01:39:28.550 --> 01:39:28.560 align:start position:0%
then look and see if it was um
 
01:39:31.510 --> 01:39:31.520 align:start position:0%
competitiveness competitive or not
 
01:39:33.189 --> 01:39:33.199 align:start position:0%
um and that's what i think should be
 
01:39:34.950 --> 01:39:34.960 align:start position:0%
done and should be the process going
 
01:39:37.109 --> 01:39:37.119 align:start position:0%
forward um
 
01:39:39.510 --> 01:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
for this body
 
01:39:42.550 --> 01:39:42.560 align:start position:0%
um the 2010 senate map now getting into
 
01:39:44.790 --> 01:39:44.800 align:start position:0%
uh the the senate map
 
01:39:47.510 --> 01:39:47.520 align:start position:0%
the 2010 senate map was already pretty
 
01:39:49.830 --> 01:39:49.840 align:start position:0%
uh partisanly swung
 
01:39:53.109 --> 01:39:53.119 align:start position:0%
you know it's been stated 50 50 in 2020
 
01:39:55.830 --> 01:39:55.840 align:start position:0%
and it was a 1410 split
 
01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:56.709 align:start position:0%
and it was a 1410 split
this

01:39:56.709 --> 01:39:56.719 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:39:59.669 --> 01:39:59.679 align:start position:0%
currently proposed map goes even further
 
01:40:01.350 --> 01:40:01.360 align:start position:0%
when it doesn't need to
 
01:40:03.910 --> 01:40:03.920 align:start position:0%
senator gray talked about how
 
01:40:05.910 --> 01:40:05.920 align:start position:0%
the population changed so we needed to
 
01:40:08.470 --> 01:40:08.480 align:start position:0%
make significant changes to
 
01:40:12.470 --> 01:40:12.480 align:start position:0%
the 2010 map it's just not true
 
01:40:14.709 --> 01:40:14.719 align:start position:0%
yes we need to make some changes if you
 
01:40:17.990 --> 01:40:18.000 align:start position:0%
put the 2010 map uh with the 2020 census
 
01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
you get a deviation of
 
01:40:23.030 --> 01:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
13.47 percent um which is higher than
 
01:40:24.950 --> 01:40:24.960 align:start position:0%
the 10 percent generally allowed by
 
01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:26.390 align:start position:0%
the 10 percent generally allowed by
courts

01:40:26.390 --> 01:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
courts
 
01:40:28.390 --> 01:40:28.400 align:start position:0%
by moving 10 pounds
 
01:40:31.109 --> 01:40:31.119 align:start position:0%
you can get that deviation to lower than
 
01:40:33.750 --> 01:40:33.760 align:start position:0%
the 7.5 that they got
 
01:40:35.669 --> 01:40:35.679 align:start position:0%
10 pounds
 
01:40:37.510 --> 01:40:37.520 align:start position:0%
most of which are in the the north
 
01:40:40.629 --> 01:40:40.639 align:start position:0%
country um swinging uh district one and
 
01:40:42.790 --> 01:40:42.800 align:start position:0%
two around a little bit gets you most of
 
01:40:46.070 --> 01:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:40:48.229 --> 01:40:48.239 align:start position:0%
one of the most egregious uh
 
01:40:51.030 --> 01:40:51.040 align:start position:0%
displays of gerrymandering is
 
01:40:53.430 --> 01:40:53.440 align:start position:0%
in this current proposal is district 9
 
01:40:55.830 --> 01:40:55.840 align:start position:0%
and 10.
 
01:40:57.270 --> 01:40:57.280 align:start position:0%
they needed to be balanced there was
 
01:40:58.950 --> 01:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
there was more people in district 9 than
 
01:41:01.109 --> 01:41:01.119 align:start position:0%
district 10 and thus something needed to
 
01:41:02.229 --> 01:41:02.239 align:start position:0%
be done
 
01:41:06.070 --> 01:41:06.080 align:start position:0%
all you needed to do was move richmond
 
01:41:09.189 --> 01:41:09.199 align:start position:0%
from district 9 to district 10 and it
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
balanced out those populations that's it
 
01:41:12.550 --> 01:41:12.560 align:start position:0%
but instead
 
01:41:15.350 --> 01:41:15.360 align:start position:0%
they moved peterborough and hancock into
 
01:41:17.510 --> 01:41:17.520 align:start position:0%
district 10 which are democrat leaning
 
01:41:20.070 --> 01:41:20.080 align:start position:0%
towns thus packing more democrats into
 
01:41:21.189 --> 01:41:21.199 align:start position:0%
district 10
 
01:41:23.830 --> 01:41:23.840 align:start position:0%
and swung district 9 all the way from
 
01:41:27.430 --> 01:41:27.440 align:start position:0%
bedford to hinsdale 72 miles it takes
 
01:41:29.830 --> 01:41:29.840 align:start position:0%
over two hours to drive it
 
01:41:31.510 --> 01:41:31.520 align:start position:0%
and in doing so
 
01:41:33.430 --> 01:41:33.440 align:start position:0%
created a new
 
01:41:35.669 --> 01:41:35.679 align:start position:0%
more republican lean district rather
 
01:41:36.250 --> 01:41:36.260 align:start position:0%
than the
 
01:41:36.260 --> 01:41:37.430 align:start position:0%
than the
[Music]

01:41:37.430 --> 01:41:37.440 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:41:39.430 --> 01:41:39.440 align:start position:0%
very competitive district district 9 had
 
01:41:42.590 --> 01:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
been in the last six to eight
 
01:41:46.390 --> 01:41:46.400 align:start position:0%
years um
 
01:41:48.950 --> 01:41:48.960 align:start position:0%
this the the least changed map of just
 
01:41:52.470 --> 01:41:52.480 align:start position:0%
10 towns would have um moved zero
 
01:41:54.390 --> 01:41:54.400 align:start position:0%
incumbents out of their districts
 
01:41:56.390 --> 01:41:56.400 align:start position:0%
instead of the the
 
01:41:59.350 --> 01:41:59.360 align:start position:0%
20 or instead of the two that were moved
 
01:42:01.750 --> 01:42:01.760 align:start position:0%
so if it was about um
 
01:42:04.149 --> 01:42:04.159 align:start position:0%
if it was about protecting incumbents
 
01:42:05.990 --> 01:42:06.000 align:start position:0%
this would have done that if it was
 
01:42:07.990 --> 01:42:08.000 align:start position:0%
about getting the lowest population
 
01:42:10.709 --> 01:42:10.719 align:start position:0%
deviation this would have done it
 
01:42:10.719 --> 01:42:11.669 align:start position:0%
deviation this would have done it
so

01:42:11.669 --> 01:42:11.679 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:42:11.679 --> 01:42:12.870 align:start position:0%
so
i

01:42:12.870 --> 01:42:12.880 align:start position:0%
i
 
01:42:14.790 --> 01:42:14.800 align:start position:0%
i can go through and talk about every
 
01:42:17.189 --> 01:42:17.199 align:start position:0%
single little change i'm not going to
 
01:42:18.790 --> 01:42:18.800 align:start position:0%
that the mat that was made on this
 
01:42:19.990 --> 01:42:20.000 align:start position:0%
senate map
 
01:42:22.390 --> 01:42:22.400 align:start position:0%
and each one of them
 
01:42:23.750 --> 01:42:23.760 align:start position:0%
is made
 
01:42:26.550 --> 01:42:26.560 align:start position:0%
to give a partisan advantage
 
01:42:29.270 --> 01:42:29.280 align:start position:0%
to the majority party
 
01:42:29.280 --> 01:42:31.430 align:start position:0%
to the majority party
um

01:42:31.430 --> 01:42:31.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:42:35.430 --> 01:42:35.440 align:start position:0%
moving on to the executive council map
 
01:42:35.440 --> 01:42:36.550 align:start position:0%
moving on to the executive council map
uh

01:42:36.550 --> 01:42:36.560 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:42:39.030 --> 01:42:39.040 align:start position:0%
again the 2010 map was already
 
01:42:40.830 --> 01:42:40.840 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered and very clearly
 
01:42:43.189 --> 01:42:43.199 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered um with the dragon
 
01:42:43.199 --> 01:42:45.030 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered um with the dragon
district

01:42:45.030 --> 01:42:45.040 align:start position:0%
district
 
01:42:46.950 --> 01:42:46.960 align:start position:0%
and yes this may look a little bit
 
01:42:46.960 --> 01:42:48.070 align:start position:0%
and yes this may look a little bit
better

01:42:48.070 --> 01:42:48.080 align:start position:0%
better
 
01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:48.950 align:start position:0%
better
but

01:42:48.950 --> 01:42:48.960 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:42:51.750 --> 01:42:51.760 align:start position:0%
in a partisan a partisan
 
01:42:51.760 --> 01:42:52.950 align:start position:0%
in a partisan a partisan
st

01:42:52.950 --> 01:42:52.960 align:start position:0%
st
 
01:42:55.990 --> 01:42:56.000 align:start position:0%
in a partisan sense it is even worse
 
01:42:58.070 --> 01:42:58.080 align:start position:0%
than the the old map
 
01:42:59.229 --> 01:42:59.239 align:start position:0%
it moves
 
01:43:02.390 --> 01:43:02.400 align:start position:0%
4.2 percent more democrats into district
 
01:43:06.070 --> 01:43:06.080 align:start position:0%
2 thus packing democrats and then uh
 
01:43:08.149 --> 01:43:08.159 align:start position:0%
which leads to
 
01:43:10.070 --> 01:43:10.080 align:start position:0%
district 4 becoming about one percent
 
01:43:12.310 --> 01:43:12.320 align:start position:0%
more republican district five becoming
 
01:43:16.870 --> 01:43:16.880 align:start position:0%
1.6 percent more republican um
 
01:43:19.669 --> 01:43:19.679 align:start position:0%
and district 1 becoming 4.2 percent more
 
01:43:21.669 --> 01:43:21.679 align:start position:0%
republican so
 
01:43:23.669 --> 01:43:23.679 align:start position:0%
it's very clear to me
 
01:43:26.310 --> 01:43:26.320 align:start position:0%
what was being done in these maps
 
01:43:27.910 --> 01:43:27.920 align:start position:0%
instead of district 2 kind of being a
 
01:43:31.510 --> 01:43:31.520 align:start position:0%
keen conquered dover district they
 
01:43:34.870 --> 01:43:34.880 align:start position:0%
made it a keen concord
 
01:43:37.189 --> 01:43:37.199 align:start position:0%
and then like hanover and up into
 
01:43:39.350 --> 01:43:39.360 align:start position:0%
northern grafton to grab democrats up
 
01:43:41.030 --> 01:43:41.040 align:start position:0%
there rather than going all the way
 
01:43:43.030 --> 01:43:43.040 align:start position:0%
across the state um
 
01:43:44.629 --> 01:43:44.639 align:start position:0%
it may look better but it's definitely
 
01:43:47.030 --> 01:43:47.040 align:start position:0%
not better it breaks up nine of the ten
 
01:43:49.030 --> 01:43:49.040 align:start position:0%
counties when it really doesn't need to
 
01:43:50.950 --> 01:43:50.960 align:start position:0%
at all um
 
01:43:53.030 --> 01:43:53.040 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:43:54.950 --> 01:43:54.960 align:start position:0%
if we had criteria we could better
 
01:43:57.350 --> 01:43:57.360 align:start position:0%
define a better map but since we don't
 
01:43:59.030 --> 01:43:59.040 align:start position:0%
have any criteria
 
01:44:00.709 --> 01:44:00.719 align:start position:0%
people can say that you know this is the
 
01:44:02.870 --> 01:44:02.880 align:start position:0%
best that we could do but it's clearly
 
01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:04.310 align:start position:0%
best that we could do but it's clearly
not

01:44:04.310 --> 01:44:04.320 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:44:04.320 --> 01:44:06.390 align:start position:0%
not
um

01:44:06.390 --> 01:44:06.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:08.870 --> 01:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
i hope that you will uh amend both of
 
01:44:08.880 --> 01:44:09.830 align:start position:0%
i hope that you will uh amend both of
these

01:44:09.830 --> 01:44:09.840 align:start position:0%
these
 
01:44:11.270 --> 01:44:11.280 align:start position:0%
uh bills
 
01:44:12.870 --> 01:44:12.880 align:start position:0%
with uh
 
01:44:15.990 --> 01:44:16.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:44:17.590 --> 01:44:17.600 align:start position:0%
fair in that
 
01:44:19.510 --> 01:44:19.520 align:start position:0%
they are more competitive
 
01:44:21.750 --> 01:44:21.760 align:start position:0%
more compact
 
01:44:23.030 --> 01:44:23.040 align:start position:0%
keep more communities of interest
 
01:44:23.040 --> 01:44:23.990 align:start position:0%
keep more communities of interest
together

01:44:23.990 --> 01:44:24.000 align:start position:0%
together
 
01:44:25.910 --> 01:44:25.920 align:start position:0%
and i hope that you will look at the the
 
01:44:28.070 --> 01:44:28.080 align:start position:0%
mapathon proposals
 
01:44:29.270 --> 01:44:29.280 align:start position:0%
and i would be
 
01:44:31.590 --> 01:44:31.600 align:start position:0%
happy to you know help out in any way
 
01:44:33.430 --> 01:44:33.440 align:start position:0%
that i can including answering any
 
01:44:35.189 --> 01:44:35.199 align:start position:0%
questions you have now
 
01:44:37.030 --> 01:44:37.040 align:start position:0%
all right thank you um mr andrews why
 
01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:38.320 align:start position:0%
don't you just go through the handout
 
01:44:39.830 --> 01:44:39.840 align:start position:0%
real quickly with us because i was
 
01:44:42.070 --> 01:44:42.080 align:start position:0%
bouncing around as you were you were
 
01:44:44.550 --> 01:44:44.560 align:start position:0%
testifying um and i believe this has
 
01:44:47.030 --> 01:44:47.040 align:start position:0%
been online now in part
 
01:44:49.350 --> 01:44:49.360 align:start position:0%
or in whole for a few days but online
 
01:44:50.470 --> 01:44:50.480 align:start position:0%
for a little bit
 
01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.270 align:start position:0%
for a little bit
um

01:44:51.270 --> 01:44:51.280 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:44:53.270 --> 01:44:53.280 align:start position:0%
you go through in the first page and
 
01:44:55.350 --> 01:44:55.360 align:start position:0%
talk about the document and a little bit
 
01:44:57.430 --> 01:44:57.440 align:start position:0%
of the history um and for members who
 
01:44:59.750 --> 01:44:59.760 align:start position:0%
might be watching i'm sort of flying
 
01:45:02.070 --> 01:45:02.080 align:start position:0%
through this because mr andrews and this
 
01:45:03.669 --> 01:45:03.679 align:start position:0%
committee are familiar with each other
 
01:45:06.070 --> 01:45:06.080 align:start position:0%
from before in the mapathon work so
 
01:45:08.310 --> 01:45:08.320 align:start position:0%
um i'm doing this just so when we break
 
01:45:11.350 --> 01:45:11.360 align:start position:0%
here people have looked at it so we know
 
01:45:12.629 --> 01:45:12.639 align:start position:0%
what we have
 
01:45:15.910 --> 01:45:15.920 align:start position:0%
um you also have provided a glossary of
 
01:45:15.920 --> 01:45:17.189 align:start position:0%
um you also have provided a glossary of
terms

01:45:17.189 --> 01:45:17.199 align:start position:0%
terms
 
01:45:19.109 --> 01:45:19.119 align:start position:0%
you have listed in the communities of
 
01:45:21.270 --> 01:45:21.280 align:start position:0%
interest definitions
 
01:45:23.910 --> 01:45:23.920 align:start position:0%
that you had were those the primary uh
 
01:45:25.750 --> 01:45:25.760 align:start position:0%
ones that you use it doesn't appear to
 
01:45:28.310 --> 01:45:28.320 align:start position:0%
be all of them but you you listed a few
 
01:45:30.229 --> 01:45:30.239 align:start position:0%
if you could just uh clarify that
 
01:45:31.510 --> 01:45:31.520 align:start position:0%
because you talked about the gross
 
01:45:33.590 --> 01:45:33.600 align:start position:0%
number that you began with
 
01:45:35.270 --> 01:45:35.280 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah we started out with i believe
 
01:45:38.310 --> 01:45:38.320 align:start position:0%
it was 63 yeah on a list of everyone and
 
01:45:40.390 --> 01:45:40.400 align:start position:0%
uh we kind of willed down to
 
01:45:41.830 --> 01:45:41.840 align:start position:0%
five um
 
01:45:44.550 --> 01:45:44.560 align:start position:0%
i don't believe there are five listed in
 
01:45:46.870 --> 01:45:46.880 align:start position:0%
your definition what were the five
 
01:45:49.350 --> 01:45:49.360 align:start position:0%
um they were
 
01:45:51.189 --> 01:45:51.199 align:start position:0%
high school districts shared water
 
01:45:54.070 --> 01:45:54.080 align:start position:0%
systems shared uh police and fire
 
01:45:56.830 --> 01:45:56.840 align:start position:0%
in addition to hospitals
 
01:45:59.510 --> 01:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
and um
 
01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:00.629 align:start position:0%
and um
we

01:46:00.629 --> 01:46:00.639 align:start position:0%
we
 
01:46:01.830 --> 01:46:01.840 align:start position:0%
there was a number of different
 
01:46:03.430 --> 01:46:03.440 align:start position:0%
communities of interest that people
 
01:46:06.629 --> 01:46:06.639 align:start position:0%
talked about with concern to um
 
01:46:11.030 --> 01:46:11.040 align:start position:0%
like pfas and kind of general um
 
01:46:13.669 --> 01:46:13.679 align:start position:0%
health and community well-being issues
 
01:46:15.830 --> 01:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
uh drug use those kind of things that we
 
01:46:18.149 --> 01:46:18.159 align:start position:0%
kind of put together and used i forget
 
01:46:20.790 --> 01:46:20.800 align:start position:0%
the exact um
 
01:46:23.590 --> 01:46:23.600 align:start position:0%
the yeah the public health um
 
01:46:27.109 --> 01:46:27.119 align:start position:0%
metric that is released by the um
 
01:46:30.470 --> 01:46:30.480 align:start position:0%
by the census bureau has a chart of um
 
01:46:31.990 --> 01:46:32.000 align:start position:0%
the general
 
01:46:34.310 --> 01:46:34.320 align:start position:0%
so high schools water districts shared
 
01:46:36.470 --> 01:46:36.480 align:start position:0%
police and fire hospitals and public
 
01:46:38.830 --> 01:46:38.840 align:start position:0%
health yep
 
01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:40.390 align:start position:0%
health yep
okay

01:46:40.390 --> 01:46:40.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:41.669 align:start position:0%
okay
um

01:46:41.669 --> 01:46:41.679 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:46:43.830 --> 01:46:43.840 align:start position:0%
yeah and we we included um
 
01:46:46.310 --> 01:46:46.320 align:start position:0%
i'm asking mr andrews as chair of the
 
01:46:48.629 --> 01:46:48.639 align:start position:0%
committee for the benefit of the the the
 
01:46:50.390 --> 01:46:50.400 align:start position:0%
committee looking at this because the
 
01:46:52.470 --> 01:46:52.480 align:start position:0%
five communities of interest that he
 
01:46:54.709 --> 01:46:54.719 align:start position:0%
mentioned were primary are do not appear
 
01:46:56.950 --> 01:46:56.960 align:start position:0%
to be listed anywhere in this document
 
01:46:59.030 --> 01:46:59.040 align:start position:0%
so i am asking him what they are he
 
01:47:00.950 --> 01:47:00.960 align:start position:0%
could only remember four
 
01:47:02.870 --> 01:47:02.880 align:start position:0%
olivia zink clarified that public health
 
01:47:05.510 --> 01:47:05.520 align:start position:0%
was the fifth is that correct yes thank
 
01:47:08.550 --> 01:47:08.560 align:start position:0%
you okay then you had some you have some
 
01:47:10.629 --> 01:47:10.639 align:start position:0%
conclusions on the executive council
 
01:47:13.270 --> 01:47:13.280 align:start position:0%
proposals and then you have
 
01:47:15.669 --> 01:47:15.679 align:start position:0%
um three maps
 
01:47:15.679 --> 01:47:17.030 align:start position:0%
um three maps
on

01:47:17.030 --> 01:47:17.040 align:start position:0%
on
 
01:47:18.709 --> 01:47:18.719 align:start position:0%
i guess page five
 
01:47:21.430 --> 01:47:21.440 align:start position:0%
and you talk about the minority majority
 
01:47:23.590 --> 01:47:23.600 align:start position:0%
and mapathon what is the minority and
 
01:47:25.669 --> 01:47:25.679 align:start position:0%
the majority proposal what does that
 
01:47:25.679 --> 01:47:26.629 align:start position:0%
the majority proposal what does that
mean

01:47:26.629 --> 01:47:26.639 align:start position:0%
mean
 
01:47:27.990 --> 01:47:28.000 align:start position:0%
um the
 
01:47:30.870 --> 01:47:30.880 align:start position:0%
majority proposal is the current um
 
01:47:32.790 --> 01:47:32.800 align:start position:0%
map that's in the in the bill that
 
01:47:35.350 --> 01:47:35.360 align:start position:0%
passed the the senate um the minority
 
01:47:37.510 --> 01:47:37.520 align:start position:0%
proposal was proposed
 
01:47:39.590 --> 01:47:39.600 align:start position:0%
um in the senate in the senate okay so
 
01:47:42.550 --> 01:47:42.560 align:start position:0%
that was a senate um bill
 
01:47:44.470 --> 01:47:44.480 align:start position:0%
proposed okay great thank you for that
 
01:47:44.480 --> 01:47:45.830 align:start position:0%
proposed okay great thank you for that
clarification

01:47:45.830 --> 01:47:45.840 align:start position:0%
clarification
 
01:47:45.840 --> 01:47:46.950 align:start position:0%
clarification
um

01:47:46.950 --> 01:47:46.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:47:50.950 --> 01:47:50.960 align:start position:0%
and then you have on the next page six
 
01:47:52.550 --> 01:47:52.560 align:start position:0%
communities of interest which are
 
01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:54.149 align:start position:0%
communities of interest which are
labeled

01:47:54.149 --> 01:47:54.159 align:start position:0%
labeled
 
01:47:56.310 --> 01:47:56.320 align:start position:0%
and then i believe the next page you've
 
01:47:58.870 --> 01:47:58.880 align:start position:0%
clearly labeled the 2010
 
01:48:01.030 --> 01:48:01.040 align:start position:0%
current map with of course the district
 
01:48:03.350 --> 01:48:03.360 align:start position:0%
2 which we heard a lot about for 10
 
01:48:03.360 --> 01:48:04.709 align:start position:0%
2 which we heard a lot about for 10
years

01:48:04.709 --> 01:48:04.719 align:start position:0%
years
 
01:48:06.709 --> 01:48:06.719 align:start position:0%
and then the next page
 
01:48:09.270 --> 01:48:09.280 align:start position:0%
we have again this is what you're
 
01:48:10.870 --> 01:48:10.880 align:start position:0%
referring to as
 
01:48:12.310 --> 01:48:12.320 align:start position:0%
the majority
 
01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:13.750 align:start position:0%
the majority
proposal

01:48:13.750 --> 01:48:13.760 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:48:13.760 --> 01:48:15.510 align:start position:0%
proposal
um

01:48:15.510 --> 01:48:15.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:48:17.669 --> 01:48:17.679 align:start position:0%
currently that we currently have before
 
01:48:20.310 --> 01:48:20.320 align:start position:0%
us correct okay and then the minority
 
01:48:21.910 --> 01:48:21.920 align:start position:0%
proposal was that another one brought in
 
01:48:23.830 --> 01:48:23.840 align:start position:0%
front of the senate yep that's that's
 
01:48:25.590 --> 01:48:25.600 align:start position:0%
the same map okay
 
01:48:27.830 --> 01:48:27.840 align:start position:0%
and then that you have your mapathon
 
01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:29.510 align:start position:0%
and then that you have your mapathon
proposal

01:48:29.510 --> 01:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
proposal
 
01:48:31.270 --> 01:48:31.280 align:start position:0%
all right and then you wrap up with some
 
01:48:33.350 --> 01:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
some comments great i just wanted to go
 
01:48:35.350 --> 01:48:35.360 align:start position:0%
through that to make sure i understood
 
01:48:37.270 --> 01:48:37.280 align:start position:0%
what i was looking at questions from the
 
01:48:39.830 --> 01:48:39.840 align:start position:0%
committee for mr andrews
 
01:48:43.270 --> 01:48:43.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:48:45.830 --> 01:48:45.840 align:start position:0%
thank you and thank you madam chair for
 
01:48:49.270 --> 01:48:49.280 align:start position:0%
having us go through that because
 
01:48:52.629 --> 01:48:52.639 align:start position:0%
it allows me to look at the actual
 
01:48:52.639 --> 01:48:53.990 align:start position:0%
it allows me to look at the actual
picture

01:48:53.990 --> 01:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
picture
 
01:48:56.870 --> 01:48:56.880 align:start position:0%
of the 2010 executive council maps and
 
01:48:58.390 --> 01:48:58.400 align:start position:0%
we all heard a lot about the dragon
 
01:49:01.270 --> 01:49:01.280 align:start position:0%
district and those of us who were there
 
01:49:02.790 --> 01:49:02.800 align:start position:0%
which is just me
 
01:49:04.950 --> 01:49:04.960 align:start position:0%
the last time we did this
 
01:49:07.270 --> 01:49:07.280 align:start position:0%
uh certainly yelled about that a great
 
01:49:09.430 --> 01:49:09.440 align:start position:0%
deal at that time
 
01:49:09.440 --> 01:49:10.870 align:start position:0%
deal at that time
but

01:49:10.870 --> 01:49:10.880 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:49:13.189 --> 01:49:13.199 align:start position:0%
what is bewildering me and what i'd like
 
01:49:15.990 --> 01:49:16.000 align:start position:0%
you to comment on is that
 
01:49:18.629 --> 01:49:18.639 align:start position:0%
uh not only the sponsor of the current
 
01:49:21.510 --> 01:49:21.520 align:start position:0%
map but but you as well said that
 
01:49:23.270 --> 01:49:23.280 align:start position:0%
this map
 
01:49:25.189 --> 01:49:25.199 align:start position:0%
looks better
 
01:49:25.199 --> 01:49:26.310 align:start position:0%
looks better
than

01:49:26.310 --> 01:49:26.320 align:start position:0%
than
 
01:49:31.990 --> 01:49:32.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:49:36.709 --> 01:49:36.719 align:start position:0%
yes there is one peculiar district here
 
01:49:40.310 --> 01:49:40.320 align:start position:0%
and here we have
 
01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.270 align:start position:0%
and here we have
three

01:49:41.270 --> 01:49:41.280 align:start position:0%
three
 
01:49:44.310 --> 01:49:44.320 align:start position:0%
exceedingly peculiar districts
 
01:49:44.320 --> 01:49:45.189 align:start position:0%
exceedingly peculiar districts
so

01:49:45.189 --> 01:49:45.199 align:start position:0%
so
 
01:49:48.870 --> 01:49:48.880 align:start position:0%
in what way does this look better than
 
01:49:51.030 --> 01:49:51.040 align:start position:0%
what we have now can i interject it
 
01:49:53.669 --> 01:49:53.679 align:start position:0%
looks fairer um represent why don't you
 
01:49:56.470 --> 01:49:56.480 align:start position:0%
go ahead and answer the question um yeah
 
01:50:00.149 --> 01:50:00.159 align:start position:0%
so madam chair i really object to that
 
01:50:00.159 --> 01:50:01.910 align:start position:0%
so madam chair i really object to that
i'm

01:50:01.910 --> 01:50:01.920 align:start position:0%
i'm
 
01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:04.550 align:start position:0%
i'm
um

01:50:04.550 --> 01:50:04.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:05.910 --> 01:50:05.920 align:start position:0%
to um
 
01:50:06.950 --> 01:50:06.960 align:start position:0%
answer that
 
01:50:09.350 --> 01:50:09.360 align:start position:0%
one way that is actually generally
 
01:50:12.390 --> 01:50:12.400 align:start position:0%
accepted in um
 
01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:13.189 align:start position:0%
accepted in um
in

01:50:13.189 --> 01:50:13.199 align:start position:0%
in
 
01:50:16.310 --> 01:50:16.320 align:start position:0%
courts and other uh ways in in
 
01:50:19.030 --> 01:50:19.040 align:start position:0%
redistricting is whether a district is
 
01:50:22.390 --> 01:50:22.400 align:start position:0%
visually compact um
 
01:50:24.950 --> 01:50:24.960 align:start position:0%
and i would agree that you know
 
01:50:28.310 --> 01:50:28.320 align:start position:0%
definitely two and five in in this newly
 
01:50:30.470 --> 01:50:30.480 align:start position:0%
proposed map are not
 
01:50:33.750 --> 01:50:33.760 align:start position:0%
visually compact um you could argue that
 
01:50:37.030 --> 01:50:37.040 align:start position:0%
district one is kind of um
 
01:50:38.629 --> 01:50:38.639 align:start position:0%
but generally if you if you look at a
 
01:50:41.589 --> 01:50:41.599 align:start position:0%
map and you say you know
 
01:50:43.430 --> 01:50:43.440 align:start position:0%
whether it it
 
01:50:49.430 --> 01:50:49.440 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:51.189 --> 01:50:51.199 align:start position:0%
i i would i would argue that you're
 
01:50:52.709 --> 01:50:52.719 align:start position:0%
you're correct in that this one does
 
01:50:54.470 --> 01:50:54.480 align:start position:0%
look look funky you have the kind of
 
01:50:56.550 --> 01:50:56.560 align:start position:0%
tendrils that reach out and grab you
 
01:50:58.709 --> 01:50:58.719 align:start position:0%
know peterborough and concord and then
 
01:51:03.270 --> 01:51:03.280 align:start position:0%
 
01:51:06.149 --> 01:51:06.159 align:start position:0%
the old map was very well defined as you
 
01:51:07.830 --> 01:51:07.840 align:start position:0%
know the dragon district and it was you
 
01:51:10.790 --> 01:51:10.800 align:start position:0%
know well known in that regard so it it
 
01:51:11.990 --> 01:51:12.000 align:start position:0%
kind of uh
 
01:51:15.270 --> 01:51:15.280 align:start position:0%
jumps out as being the you know the
 
01:51:17.109 --> 01:51:17.119 align:start position:0%
example of gerrymandering in the last 10
 
01:51:19.430 --> 01:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
years and thus um
 
01:51:21.750 --> 01:51:21.760 align:start position:0%
that's why i i clarified that that was
 
01:51:23.830 --> 01:51:23.840 align:start position:0%
you know looked worse
 
01:51:27.270 --> 01:51:27.280 align:start position:0%
probably follow up
 
01:51:28.790 --> 01:51:28.800 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair and thank you for
 
01:51:31.589 --> 01:51:31.599 align:start position:0%
taking my follow-up um
 
01:51:34.229 --> 01:51:34.239 align:start position:0%
and and
 
01:51:37.189 --> 01:51:37.199 align:start position:0%
now stepping away from the shapes and
 
01:51:39.910 --> 01:51:39.920 align:start position:0%
considering what is
 
01:51:43.350 --> 01:51:43.360 align:start position:0%
uh underlying the maps
 
01:51:47.189 --> 01:51:47.199 align:start position:0%
would you agree with me that
 
01:51:50.149 --> 01:51:50.159 align:start position:0%
what we have done in changing from the
 
01:51:52.550 --> 01:51:52.560 align:start position:0%
old map to the new map
 
01:51:54.629 --> 01:51:54.639 align:start position:0%
is that
 
01:51:57.589 --> 01:51:57.599 align:start position:0%
we have significantly
 
01:51:57.599 --> 01:51:58.510 align:start position:0%
we have significantly
uh

01:51:58.510 --> 01:51:58.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:01.270 --> 01:52:01.280 align:start position:0%
disadvantaged pretty much everything
 
01:52:04.229 --> 01:52:04.239 align:start position:0%
north have conquered in terms of
 
01:52:07.109 --> 01:52:07.119 align:start position:0%
having their own
 
01:52:09.189 --> 01:52:09.199 align:start position:0%
having having a representative who both
 
01:52:10.629 --> 01:52:10.639 align:start position:0%
lives in
 
01:52:13.750 --> 01:52:13.760 align:start position:0%
in the heart of their district
 
01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:14.830 align:start position:0%
in the heart of their district
and

01:52:14.830 --> 01:52:14.840 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:52:18.870 --> 01:52:18.880 align:start position:0%
having a district that is
 
01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:19.669 align:start position:0%
having a district that is
uh

01:52:19.669 --> 01:52:19.679 align:start position:0%
uh
 
01:52:22.390 --> 01:52:22.400 align:start position:0%
that has a completely
 
01:52:25.189 --> 01:52:25.199 align:start position:0%
diffused population
 
01:52:27.430 --> 01:52:27.440 align:start position:0%
a district composed of small towns small
 
01:52:31.430 --> 01:52:31.440 align:start position:0%
cities and and even smaller towns
 
01:52:33.430 --> 01:52:33.440 align:start position:0%
rather than being
 
01:52:37.030 --> 01:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
connected to significant population
 
01:52:37.040 --> 01:52:38.390 align:start position:0%
connected to significant population
centers

01:52:38.390 --> 01:52:38.400 align:start position:0%
centers
 
01:52:41.350 --> 01:52:41.360 align:start position:0%
which share even less
 
01:52:44.629 --> 01:52:44.639 align:start position:0%
with the very rural districts yeah i
 
01:52:46.550 --> 01:52:46.560 align:start position:0%
think that especially with the executive
 
01:52:49.990 --> 01:52:50.000 align:start position:0%
council map you can think of it as um
 
01:52:52.709 --> 01:52:52.719 align:start position:0%
almost regionally um
 
01:52:55.350 --> 01:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
for instance like when i would would
 
01:52:57.669 --> 01:52:57.679 align:start position:0%
draw executive council maps i would i
 
01:52:58.709 --> 01:52:58.719 align:start position:0%
would think
 
01:53:00.790 --> 01:53:00.800 align:start position:0%
you know all right five districts or
 
01:53:02.870 --> 01:53:02.880 align:start position:0%
what kind of five regions of new
 
01:53:04.709 --> 01:53:04.719 align:start position:0%
hampshire are there you know north of
 
01:53:06.790 --> 01:53:06.800 align:start position:0%
concord uh keene
 
01:53:08.070 --> 01:53:08.080 align:start position:0%
um you know
 
01:53:11.589 --> 01:53:11.599 align:start position:0%
nashua manchester uh seacoast those are
 
01:53:13.430 --> 01:53:13.440 align:start position:0%
kind of the five that i you know think
 
01:53:15.910 --> 01:53:15.920 align:start position:0%
about in my in my head um and so that's
 
01:53:17.830 --> 01:53:17.840 align:start position:0%
what how i would kind of draw it out
 
01:53:20.870 --> 01:53:20.880 align:start position:0%
because i would think you know
 
01:53:22.470 --> 01:53:22.480 align:start position:0%
a lot of the towns
 
01:53:24.790 --> 01:53:24.800 align:start position:0%
north of concord have a lot much more in
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
common with each other than do towns
 
01:53:29.750 --> 01:53:29.760 align:start position:0%
kind of south of new hampshire so um
 
01:53:32.709 --> 01:53:32.719 align:start position:0%
yeah i agree that it
 
01:53:34.390 --> 01:53:34.400 align:start position:0%
will definitely
 
01:53:36.229 --> 01:53:36.239 align:start position:0%
it could
 
01:53:38.390 --> 01:53:38.400 align:start position:0%
lead to less kind of
 
01:53:40.790 --> 01:53:40.800 align:start position:0%
representation in in the north country
 
01:53:44.149 --> 01:53:44.159 align:start position:0%
you know if you get a um
 
01:53:45.510 --> 01:53:45.520 align:start position:0%
a rep uh
 
01:53:47.270 --> 01:53:47.280 align:start position:0%
executive councilor out of dover and you
 
01:53:49.990 --> 01:53:50.000 align:start position:0%
get one out of keene um
 
01:53:52.310 --> 01:53:52.320 align:start position:0%
the north country it it's gonna be both
 
01:53:54.149 --> 01:53:54.159 align:start position:0%
difficult for them to travel up there
 
01:53:55.350 --> 01:53:55.360 align:start position:0%
and also
 
01:53:57.510 --> 01:53:57.520 align:start position:0%
for them to have a kind of sense of
 
01:53:58.950 --> 01:53:58.960 align:start position:0%
community and
 
01:54:01.910 --> 01:54:01.920 align:start position:0%
really know what the residents of those
 
01:54:05.030 --> 01:54:05.040 align:start position:0%
districts really want from their
 
01:54:05.040 --> 01:54:07.430 align:start position:0%
districts really want from their
counselor

01:54:07.430 --> 01:54:07.440 align:start position:0%

some technical difficulties that look
 
03:07:17.269 --> 03:07:17.279 align:start position:0%
like they've been resolved we are live
 
03:07:19.670 --> 03:07:19.680 align:start position:0%

bills we just heard the notice in the

03:07:34.070 --> 03:07:34.080 align:start position:0%
and we're going to go forward this
 
03:07:41.030 --> 03:07:41.040 align:start position:0%
afternoon with sb 240 and sb 241
 
03:07:43.590 --> 03:07:43.600 align:start position:0%
so with that i'm going to ask if there's
 
03:07:47.190 --> 03:07:47.200 align:start position:0%
a motion on sb 240 representative
 
03:07:47.200 --> 03:07:48.630 align:start position:0%
a motion on sb 240 representative
mcguire

03:07:48.630 --> 03:07:48.640 align:start position:0%
mcguire
 
03:07:51.590 --> 03:07:51.600 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair i move out to pass
 
03:07:53.830 --> 03:07:53.840 align:start position:0%
is there a second to that motion
 
03:07:53.840 --> 03:07:54.790 align:start position:0%
is there a second to that motion
second

03:07:54.790 --> 03:07:54.800 align:start position:0%
second
 
03:07:56.550 --> 03:07:56.560 align:start position:0%
representative lynn seconds it
 
03:07:58.389 --> 03:07:58.399 align:start position:0%
representative mcguire would you like to
 
03:08:01.750 --> 03:08:01.760 align:start position:0%
speak to your motion yes madam chair
 
03:08:04.950 --> 03:08:04.960 align:start position:0%
senate bill 240 is the state senate
 
03:08:08.790 --> 03:08:08.800 align:start position:0%
districts as devised by the state senate
 
03:08:11.990 --> 03:08:12.000 align:start position:0%
they meet all legal and constitutional
 
03:08:12.000 --> 03:08:13.349 align:start position:0%
they meet all legal and constitutional
requirements

03:08:13.349 --> 03:08:13.359 align:start position:0%
requirements
 
03:08:15.830 --> 03:08:15.840 align:start position:0%
the districts are contiguous the
 
03:08:17.510 --> 03:08:17.520 align:start position:0%
populations are
 
03:08:21.510 --> 03:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
equal within appropriate limits and
 
03:08:21.520 --> 03:08:22.630 align:start position:0%
equal within appropriate limits and
therefore

03:08:22.630 --> 03:08:22.640 align:start position:0%
therefore
 
03:08:25.670 --> 03:08:25.680 align:start position:0%
i believe that that since we've verified
 
03:08:27.510 --> 03:08:27.520 align:start position:0%
that they meet all requirements we
 
03:08:29.510 --> 03:08:29.520 align:start position:0%
should support our colleagues in the
 
03:08:31.670 --> 03:08:31.680 align:start position:0%
senate and vote for it
 
03:08:33.590 --> 03:08:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you representative mcguire further
 
03:08:38.950 --> 03:08:38.960 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:42.070 --> 03:08:42.080 align:start position:0%
 
03:08:45.030 --> 03:08:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:08:47.750 --> 03:08:47.760 align:start position:0%
while i agree with my colleagues that we
 
03:08:49.830 --> 03:08:49.840 align:start position:0%
should be very deferential to the wishes
 
03:08:51.670 --> 03:08:51.680 align:start position:0%
of the senate
 
03:08:51.680 --> 03:08:52.550 align:start position:0%
of the senate
in

03:08:52.550 --> 03:08:52.560 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:08:54.550 --> 03:08:54.560 align:start position:0%
dealing just as we hope that they are
 
03:08:56.790 --> 03:08:56.800 align:start position:0%
deferential to us in the
 
03:08:58.950 --> 03:08:58.960 align:start position:0%
redistricting of the house
 
03:09:01.190 --> 03:09:01.200 align:start position:0%
i have to point out that the map that we
 
03:09:04.550 --> 03:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
have been sent has significant defects
 
03:09:05.510 --> 03:09:05.520 align:start position:0%
in it
 
03:09:07.030 --> 03:09:07.040 align:start position:0%
and one of the things that we heard
 
03:09:09.190 --> 03:09:09.200 align:start position:0%
again and again when we had joint
 
03:09:11.510 --> 03:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
hearings on other issues but
 
03:09:13.590 --> 03:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
it can't be any different for the senate
 
03:09:16.230 --> 03:09:16.240 align:start position:0%
districts is that our constituents
 
03:09:18.550 --> 03:09:18.560 align:start position:0%
wanted districts that were compact and
 
03:09:18.560 --> 03:09:19.990 align:start position:0%
wanted districts that were compact and
competitive

03:09:19.990 --> 03:09:20.000 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
03:09:21.269 --> 03:09:21.279 align:start position:0%
and this map
 
03:09:24.389 --> 03:09:24.399 align:start position:0%
provides neither we have
 
03:09:27.190 --> 03:09:27.200 align:start position:0%
a number of districts first of all that
 
03:09:29.750 --> 03:09:29.760 align:start position:0%
have been
 
03:09:31.990 --> 03:09:32.000 align:start position:0%
the the partisan divide in the districts
 
03:09:35.670 --> 03:09:35.680 align:start position:0%
has has increased enormously so
 
03:09:37.510 --> 03:09:37.520 align:start position:0%
uh 15 of the
 
03:09:39.590 --> 03:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
districts are demonstrably now more
 
03:09:42.790 --> 03:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
republican leaning and
 
03:09:45.510 --> 03:09:45.520 align:start position:0%
the democratic districts have been
 
03:09:48.469 --> 03:09:48.479 align:start position:0%
packed so that their partisan lien is
 
03:09:50.550 --> 03:09:50.560 align:start position:0%
far far greater than that of the
 
03:09:52.309 --> 03:09:52.319 align:start position:0%
republican districts
 
03:09:55.190 --> 03:09:55.200 align:start position:0%
so that concerns me for for item number
 
03:09:55.200 --> 03:09:56.229 align:start position:0%
so that concerns me for for item number
one

03:09:56.229 --> 03:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
one
 
03:10:00.710 --> 03:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
item number two which is that um
 
03:10:02.750 --> 03:10:02.760 align:start position:0%
communities of interest have been
 
03:10:05.590 --> 03:10:05.600 align:start position:0%
unnecessarily split in forming these
 
03:10:09.110 --> 03:10:09.120 align:start position:0%
maps you have the most obvious issue is
 
03:10:11.670 --> 03:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
in district nine which now stretches
 
03:10:13.830 --> 03:10:13.840 align:start position:0%
from the connecticut river
 
03:10:16.950 --> 03:10:16.960 align:start position:0%
some 70 miles some of which are
 
03:10:16.960 --> 03:10:18.309 align:start position:0%
some 70 miles some of which are
not

03:10:18.309 --> 03:10:18.319 align:start position:0%
not
 
03:10:20.950 --> 03:10:20.960 align:start position:0%
really following the way the roads go
 
03:10:24.309 --> 03:10:24.319 align:start position:0%
uh all the way over to the outskirts of
 
03:10:27.990 --> 03:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
manchester uh there are no interests in
 
03:10:30.550 --> 03:10:30.560 align:start position:0%
common in that district and
 
03:10:32.710 --> 03:10:32.720 align:start position:0%
uh speaking from the cheshire county
 
03:10:35.110 --> 03:10:35.120 align:start position:0%
perspective the cheshire county part of
 
03:10:37.590 --> 03:10:37.600 align:start position:0%
that map is significantly disadvantaged
 
03:10:37.600 --> 03:10:38.469 align:start position:0%
that map is significantly disadvantaged
by

03:10:38.469 --> 03:10:38.479 align:start position:0%
by
 
03:10:41.030 --> 03:10:41.040 align:start position:0%
being outweighed by the population being
 
03:10:47.190 --> 03:10:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
03:10:50.630 --> 03:10:50.640 align:start position:0%
district 10 which used to be entirely in
 
03:10:52.389 --> 03:10:52.399 align:start position:0%
cheshire county which made a great deal
 
03:10:53.590 --> 03:10:53.600 align:start position:0%
of sense
 
03:10:55.429 --> 03:10:55.439 align:start position:0%
now includes a couple of hillsborough
 
03:10:57.670 --> 03:10:57.680 align:start position:0%
county towns whereas cheshire county
 
03:10:59.670 --> 03:10:59.680 align:start position:0%
which is a small county
 
03:11:02.150 --> 03:11:02.160 align:start position:0%
has been added to parts of four
 
03:11:05.830 --> 03:11:05.840 align:start position:0%
different senatorial districts
 
03:11:10.229 --> 03:11:10.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:11:14.229 --> 03:11:14.239 align:start position:0%
with respect to the cities
 
03:11:17.190 --> 03:11:17.200 align:start position:0%
nashua has been split up and
 
03:11:20.229 --> 03:11:20.239 align:start position:0%
nashua this remains split up but some of
 
03:11:22.389 --> 03:11:22.399 align:start position:0%
some of the district 12 goes all the way
 
03:11:25.510 --> 03:11:25.520 align:start position:0%
to rindge and cheshire county
 
03:11:27.750 --> 03:11:27.760 align:start position:0%
manchester has been split up between
 
03:11:30.790 --> 03:11:30.800 align:start position:0%
three different senatorial districts
 
03:11:35.349 --> 03:11:35.359 align:start position:0%
and ward one has been connected
 
03:11:38.710 --> 03:11:38.720 align:start position:0%
to candia goffstown hooksett and raymond
 
03:11:38.720 --> 03:11:40.150 align:start position:0%
to candia goffstown hooksett and raymond
again

03:11:40.150 --> 03:11:40.160 align:start position:0%
again
 
03:11:43.910 --> 03:11:43.920 align:start position:0%
ignoring communities of interest
 
03:11:45.110 --> 03:11:45.120 align:start position:0%
and so
 
03:11:51.269 --> 03:11:51.279 align:start position:0%
i am concerned that this map has uh
 
03:11:51.279 --> 03:11:52.150 align:start position:0%
i am concerned that this map has uh
really

03:11:52.150 --> 03:11:52.160 align:start position:0%
really
 
03:11:54.229 --> 03:11:54.239 align:start position:0%
been drawn to preserve the interests of
 
03:11:57.110 --> 03:11:57.120 align:start position:0%
incumbents to the detriment of creating
 
03:11:57.120 --> 03:11:59.750 align:start position:0%
incumbents to the detriment of creating
competitive

03:11:59.750 --> 03:11:59.760 align:start position:0%
competitive
 
03:12:01.990 --> 03:12:02.000 align:start position:0%
districts and so that's my concern about
 
03:12:03.349 --> 03:12:03.359 align:start position:0%
it and why i won't be voting for it
 
03:12:04.469 --> 03:12:04.479 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:12:09.030 --> 03:12:09.040 align:start position:0%
 
03:12:11.190 --> 03:12:11.200 align:start position:0%
representative lane
 
03:12:13.110 --> 03:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:12:14.469 --> 03:12:14.479 align:start position:0%
while i agree
 
03:12:17.510 --> 03:12:17.520 align:start position:0%
with the representative um mcguire that
 
03:12:19.510 --> 03:12:19.520 align:start position:0%
meets the legal requirements i think we
 
03:12:21.349 --> 03:12:21.359 align:start position:0%
should strive for more than the bare
 
03:12:23.349 --> 03:12:23.359 align:start position:0%
legal requirements
 
03:12:26.389 --> 03:12:26.399 align:start position:0%
we represent all of our constituents not
 
03:12:28.469 --> 03:12:28.479 align:start position:0%
just those that are of our party and we
 
03:12:30.870 --> 03:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
owe them a duty to give them the best
 
03:12:33.110 --> 03:12:33.120 align:start position:0%
maps possible and i do not think that
 
03:12:34.950 --> 03:12:34.960 align:start position:0%
the maps that were proposed and passed
 
03:12:37.510 --> 03:12:37.520 align:start position:0%
in the senate are those maps
 
03:12:39.190 --> 03:12:39.200 align:start position:0%
and i would like to say that if we're
 
03:12:41.830 --> 03:12:41.840 align:start position:0%
truly concerned about election integrity
 
03:12:43.670 --> 03:12:43.680 align:start position:0%
the way we talk about and the election
 
03:12:45.349 --> 03:12:45.359 align:start position:0%
law committee
 
03:12:47.910 --> 03:12:47.920 align:start position:0%
then we need to focus more on than just
 
03:12:50.469 --> 03:12:50.479 align:start position:0%
on the security of elections but we also
 
03:12:52.389 --> 03:12:52.399 align:start position:0%
need to let voters know
 
03:12:54.070 --> 03:12:54.080 align:start position:0%
that they are going to go into the
 
03:12:55.590 --> 03:12:55.600 align:start position:0%
ballot box
 
03:12:58.070 --> 03:12:58.080 align:start position:0%
and at the vote sorry the voting booth
 
03:13:00.790 --> 03:13:00.800 align:start position:0%
and have a real choice and that their
 
03:13:02.710 --> 03:13:02.720 align:start position:0%
choice is going to matter and under
 
03:13:05.030 --> 03:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
these maps for many people in new
 
03:13:06.950 --> 03:13:06.960 align:start position:0%
hampshire that is not going to be the
 
03:13:09.030 --> 03:13:09.040 align:start position:0%
case and i think we could do a better
 
03:13:10.630 --> 03:13:10.640 align:start position:0%
job and i had hoped that we would have
 
03:13:12.150 --> 03:13:12.160 align:start position:0%
done a better job
 
03:13:13.590 --> 03:13:13.600 align:start position:0%
and for that reason
 
03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
and others i will not be voting for this
 
03:13:17.750 --> 03:13:17.760 align:start position:0%
map thank you
 
03:13:21.590 --> 03:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:23.830 --> 03:13:23.840 align:start position:0%
seeing none i'm going to ask the clerk

thank you madam chair
 
03:14:56.550 --> 03:14:56.560 align:start position:0%
i would move to amend senate bill
 
03:15:00.389 --> 03:15:00.399 align:start position:0%
241 with amendment number 2022
 
03:15:03.750 --> 03:15:03.760 align:start position:0%
dash 1543 h and i request to speak to
 
03:15:05.349 --> 03:15:05.359 align:start position:0%
that amendment is there a second
 
03:15:07.269 --> 03:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
representative weber second set
 
03:15:09.190 --> 03:15:09.200 align:start position:0%
representative bergeron
 
03:15:11.030 --> 03:15:11.040 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
 
03:15:11.040 --> 03:15:12.070 align:start position:0%
thank you madam chair
um

03:15:12.070 --> 03:15:12.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:13.990 --> 03:15:14.000 align:start position:0%
let me first anticipate probably one of
 
03:15:16.309 --> 03:15:16.319 align:start position:0%
the first questions i will get after i
 
03:15:19.349 --> 03:15:19.359 align:start position:0%
speak so i won't have to answer it later
 
03:15:21.990 --> 03:15:22.000 align:start position:0%
and this was unexpected the map-a-thon
 
03:15:23.750 --> 03:15:23.760 align:start position:0%
handout that
 
03:15:25.269 --> 03:15:25.279 align:start position:0%
was distributed during the public
 
03:15:27.110 --> 03:15:27.120 align:start position:0%
hearing relative to the executive
 
03:15:28.550 --> 03:15:28.560 align:start position:0%
council map
 
03:15:31.510 --> 03:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
references a minority proposal and
 
03:15:33.110 --> 03:15:33.120 align:start position:0%
provides some data regarding that
 
03:15:34.630 --> 03:15:34.640 align:start position:0%
minority proposal
 
03:15:36.469 --> 03:15:36.479 align:start position:0%
that is the proposal that was submitted
 
03:15:38.790 --> 03:15:38.800 align:start position:0%
by the minority in the senate and it is
 
03:15:40.389 --> 03:15:40.399 align:start position:0%
the proposal that's before you today
 
03:15:42.630 --> 03:15:42.640 align:start position:0%
with the amendment that i just cited
 
03:15:44.309 --> 03:15:44.319 align:start position:0%
um i began
 
03:15:45.750 --> 03:15:45.760 align:start position:0%
during the public hearing i think i only
 
03:15:47.830 --> 03:15:47.840 align:start position:0%
asked one question and it was asked of
 
03:15:50.950 --> 03:15:50.960 align:start position:0%
senator gray regarding this bill
 
03:15:52.870 --> 03:15:52.880 align:start position:0%
why didn't they just keep the existing
 
03:15:55.030 --> 03:15:55.040 align:start position:0%
districts the way they were because
 
03:15:57.269 --> 03:15:57.279 align:start position:0%
the population fell well within the
 
03:15:59.830 --> 03:15:59.840 align:start position:0%
acceptable range of deviation
 
03:16:02.710 --> 03:16:02.720 align:start position:0%
and his answer was
 
03:16:05.510 --> 03:16:05.520 align:start position:0%
given the public testimony we heard
 
03:16:07.750 --> 03:16:07.760 align:start position:0%
and the shape of executive council
 
03:16:09.030 --> 03:16:09.040 align:start position:0%
district 2
 
03:16:11.510 --> 03:16:11.520 align:start position:0%
and he was very very jointly avoided
 
03:16:14.389 --> 03:16:14.399 align:start position:0%
using the word gerrymandered district
 
03:16:16.870 --> 03:16:16.880 align:start position:0%
but i'm going to use it but he said that
 
03:16:18.790 --> 03:16:18.800 align:start position:0%
was the reason for trying to redraw the
 
03:16:18.800 --> 03:16:20.150 align:start position:0%
was the reason for trying to redraw the
map

03:16:20.150 --> 03:16:20.160 align:start position:0%
map
 
03:16:23.030 --> 03:16:23.040 align:start position:0%
unfortunately or
 
03:16:24.710 --> 03:16:24.720 align:start position:0%
or not
 
03:16:27.030 --> 03:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
the senate plan kind of hacked away
 
03:16:29.190 --> 03:16:29.200 align:start position:0%
the western portion of district 1 south
 
03:16:31.590 --> 03:16:31.600 align:start position:0%
of carroll and west of lincoln and move
 
03:16:34.389 --> 03:16:34.399 align:start position:0%
that into district 2.
 
03:16:36.790 --> 03:16:36.800 align:start position:0%
district 5 has kind of a funny shape
 
03:16:39.030 --> 03:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
almost like an alligator taking us a
 
03:16:40.309 --> 03:16:40.319 align:start position:0%
bite out of
 
03:16:42.389 --> 03:16:42.399 align:start position:0%
proposed district 2 under senate bill
 
03:16:44.710 --> 03:16:44.720 align:start position:0%
241 so now instead of having
 
03:16:46.870 --> 03:16:46.880 align:start position:0%
one oddly shaped executive council
 
03:16:49.429 --> 03:16:49.439 align:start position:0%
district we have three
 
03:16:51.910 --> 03:16:51.920 align:start position:0%
the amendment that's before you
 
03:16:54.070 --> 03:16:54.080 align:start position:0%
proposes that
 
03:16:58.389 --> 03:16:58.399 align:start position:0%
district one would run south
 
03:17:00.870 --> 03:17:00.880 align:start position:0%
i'm sorry geographically district one
 
03:17:02.469 --> 03:17:02.479 align:start position:0%
would remain a large district that
 
03:17:04.070 --> 03:17:04.080 align:start position:0%
encompasses the northern part of the
 
03:17:06.630 --> 03:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
state it's not split in half
 
03:17:09.830 --> 03:17:09.840 align:start position:0%
as proposed by senate bill 241
 
03:17:11.750 --> 03:17:11.760 align:start position:0%
the districts that we're proposing in
 
03:17:14.229 --> 03:17:14.239 align:start position:0%
the minority proposal try and keep
 
03:17:16.710 --> 03:17:16.720 align:start position:0%
counties intact within the consular
 
03:17:18.950 --> 03:17:18.960 align:start position:0%
districts as much as possible and in
 
03:17:21.429 --> 03:17:21.439 align:start position:0%
district one it incorporates five entire
 
03:17:24.389 --> 03:17:24.399 align:start position:0%
counties coast carroll grafton belknap
 
03:17:25.590 --> 03:17:25.600 align:start position:0%
and sullivan
 
03:17:27.990 --> 03:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
rather than a district that's proposed
 
03:17:29.510 --> 03:17:29.520 align:start position:0%
that has seven different counties or
 
03:17:32.070 --> 03:17:32.080 align:start position:0%
pieces of them in that district
 
03:17:33.990 --> 03:17:34.000 align:start position:0%
district two which was terribly
 
03:17:36.229 --> 03:17:36.239 align:start position:0%
gerrymandered currently and in the
 
03:17:38.309 --> 03:17:38.319 align:start position:0%
proposed senate plan
 
03:17:39.830 --> 03:17:39.840 align:start position:0%
would become a much more compact
 
03:17:42.710 --> 03:17:42.720 align:start position:0%
district under the minority proposal it
 
03:17:44.469 --> 03:17:44.479 align:start position:0%
would include merrimack and stafford
 
03:17:46.229 --> 03:17:46.239 align:start position:0%
counties in the northwestern part of
 
03:17:48.229 --> 03:17:48.239 align:start position:0%
rockingham county
 
03:17:49.990 --> 03:17:50.000 align:start position:0%
district 3 remains similar to the
 
03:17:51.830 --> 03:17:51.840 align:start position:0%
existing district but
 
03:17:54.469 --> 03:17:54.479 align:start position:0%
places candy and hudson in the district
 
03:17:56.229 --> 03:17:56.239 align:start position:0%
and moves dairy into district 4 to
 
03:17:58.790 --> 03:17:58.800 align:start position:0%
balance some population shifts
 
03:18:01.349 --> 03:18:01.359 align:start position:0%
district 4 becomes more compact the only
 
03:18:03.110 --> 03:18:03.120 align:start position:0%
town in the proposed district that does
 
03:18:05.030 --> 03:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
not share a border with manchester is
 
03:18:05.040 --> 03:18:06.070 align:start position:0%
not share a border with manchester is
derry

03:18:06.070 --> 03:18:06.080 align:start position:0%
derry
 
03:18:08.469 --> 03:18:08.479 align:start position:0%
and district 5 would now encompass the
 
03:18:10.870 --> 03:18:10.880 align:start position:0%
entirety of cheshire county and the vast
 
03:18:12.790 --> 03:18:12.800 align:start position:0%
majority of hillsborough county
 
03:18:15.510 --> 03:18:15.520 align:start position:0%
including nashua that's the major
 
03:18:17.349 --> 03:18:17.359 align:start position:0%
differences between what's being
 
03:18:19.110 --> 03:18:19.120 align:start position:0%
proposed in this amendment and what's
 
03:18:23.110 --> 03:18:23.120 align:start position:0%
before us in senate bill 241 and i would
 
03:18:24.469 --> 03:18:24.479 align:start position:0%
appreciate your support for the
 
03:18:24.479 --> 03:18:25.830 align:start position:0%

1543 representative mcgee yes thank you
 
03:18:39.990 --> 03:18:40.000 align:start position:0%
madam chairman
 
03:18:43.510 --> 03:18:43.520 align:start position:0%
uh i just noticed in looking at the map
 
03:18:45.990 --> 03:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
mapathon breakdown that a another
 
03:18:49.030 --> 03:18:49.040 align:start position:0%
comparison chart here
 
03:18:50.389 --> 03:18:50.399 align:start position:0%
lists that
 
03:18:52.950 --> 03:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
the high school sau splits
 
03:18:56.070 --> 03:18:56.080 align:start position:0%
under the current senate proposal
 
03:18:57.750 --> 03:18:57.760 align:start position:0%
come out to 17
 
03:19:00.150 --> 03:19:00.160 align:start position:0%
saus that are split their districts are
 
03:19:00.160 --> 03:19:01.030 align:start position:0%
saus that are split their districts are
split

03:19:01.030 --> 03:19:01.040 align:start position:0%
split
 
03:19:04.870 --> 03:19:04.880 align:start position:0%
and the mapathon version is is three
 
03:19:06.790 --> 03:19:06.800 align:start position:0%
so it's an improvement there for
 
03:19:08.229 --> 03:19:08.239 align:start position:0%
something that i know
 
03:19:10.469 --> 03:19:10.479 align:start position:0%
folks were coming out uh to the hearings
 
03:19:12.469 --> 03:19:12.479 align:start position:0%
and asking for that there be some regard
 
03:19:14.469 --> 03:19:14.479 align:start position:0%
given for those so there's a preference
 
03:19:14.479 --> 03:19:15.510 align:start position:0%
given for those so there's a preference
there

03:19:15.510 --> 03:19:15.520 align:start position:0%
there
 
03:19:15.520 --> 03:19:16.469 align:start position:0%
there
um

03:19:16.469 --> 03:19:16.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:19.269 --> 03:19:19.279 align:start position:0%
and also the county splits which we
 
03:19:21.590 --> 03:19:21.600 align:start position:0%
discussed in earlier testimony
 
03:19:24.389 --> 03:19:24.399 align:start position:0%
uh are about half so the senate proposal
 
03:19:27.269 --> 03:19:27.279 align:start position:0%
has nine county splits and the mapathon
 
03:19:29.590 --> 03:19:29.600 align:start position:0%
version uh has
 
03:19:29.600 --> 03:19:31.830 align:start position:0%
version uh has
five

03:19:31.830 --> 03:19:31.840 align:start position:0%
five
 
03:19:34.469 --> 03:19:34.479 align:start position:0%
just for your consideration
 
03:19:36.710 --> 03:19:36.720 align:start position:0%

she's talking about the mapathon
 
03:19:42.070 --> 03:19:42.080 align:start position:0%
proposal isn't this the senate minority
 
03:19:44.389 --> 03:19:44.399 align:start position:0%
proposal or instead
 
03:19:46.790 --> 03:19:46.800 align:start position:0%

03:19:49.110 --> 03:19:49.120 align:start position:0%

03:19:56.070 --> 03:19:56.080 align:start position:0%
may manage
 
03:19:57.269 --> 03:19:57.279 align:start position:0%
if you can explain because it is
 
03:19:59.190 --> 03:19:59.200 align:start position:0%
presented in the mapathon work as a
 
03:20:01.190 --> 03:20:01.200 align:start position:0%
minority proposal
 
03:20:04.070 --> 03:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
yes the uh the minority proposal uh is
 
03:20:05.910 --> 03:20:05.920 align:start position:0%

counselor maps
 
03:22:22.309 --> 03:22:22.319 align:start position:0%
based on the most current census data
 
03:22:24.469 --> 03:22:24.479 align:start position:0%
it uh ends up with a deviation just
 
03:22:27.830 --> 03:22:27.840 align:start position:0%
slightly higher than one percent
 
03:22:29.830 --> 03:22:29.840 align:start position:0%
it removes the old district two which
 
03:22:32.710 --> 03:22:32.720 align:start position:0%
there is much consternation over
 
03:22:34.469 --> 03:22:34.479 align:start position:0%
and lastly it does meet all
 
03:22:36.870 --> 03:22:36.880 align:start position:0%
constitutional and legal requirements
 
03:22:39.110 --> 03:22:39.120 align:start position:0%

03:22:49.349 --> 03:22:49.359 align:start position:0%
i'm representative lane
 
03:22:52.150 --> 03:22:52.160 align:start position:0%
well if nobody else is uh so
 
03:22:52.160 --> 03:22:54.070 align:start position:0%
well if nobody else is uh so
um

03:22:54.070 --> 03:22:54.080 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:56.550 --> 03:22:56.560 align:start position:0%
well i agree that it replaces the old
 
03:22:58.950 --> 03:22:58.960 align:start position:0%
district number two which is a dragon or
 
03:23:01.030 --> 03:23:01.040 align:start position:0%
a snake depending on how you want to
 
03:23:03.910 --> 03:23:03.920 align:start position:0%
call it it actually is
 
03:23:06.389 --> 03:23:06.399 align:start position:0%
ends up with a worse result and is is
 
03:23:08.870 --> 03:23:08.880 align:start position:0%
more gerrymandered than the one that was
 
03:23:13.110 --> 03:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
put forth in 2010 and adopted in 2011.
 
03:23:14.870 --> 03:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
and not to sound like a broken record
 
03:23:17.510 --> 03:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
but i will repeat what i said last time
 
03:23:19.190 --> 03:23:19.200 align:start position:0%
that we should strive for more than the
 
03:23:21.429 --> 03:23:21.439 align:start position:0%
bare legal requirements
 
03:23:23.990 --> 03:23:24.000 align:start position:0%
we represent all our voters i represent
 
03:23:26.550 --> 03:23:26.560 align:start position:0%
the republican voters in my district
 
03:23:28.150 --> 03:23:28.160 align:start position:0%
even though i'm a democrat i still
 
03:23:29.830 --> 03:23:29.840 align:start position:0%
represent them and vote for their best
 
03:23:29.840 --> 03:23:31.590 align:start position:0%
represent them and vote for their best
interest

03:23:31.590 --> 03:23:31.600 align:start position:0%
interest
 
03:23:33.670 --> 03:23:33.680 align:start position:0%
and i think that if you are concerned
 
03:23:35.510 --> 03:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
about election integrity you want people
 
03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
to have faith in our entire election
 
03:23:39.590 --> 03:23:39.600 align:start position:0%
process and that includes the
 
03:23:41.510 --> 03:23:41.520 align:start position:0%
redistricting process
 
03:23:44.150 --> 03:23:44.160 align:start position:0%
and with this map and the other maps you
 
03:23:46.309 --> 03:23:46.319 align:start position:0%
are discouraging people
 
03:23:46.319 --> 03:23:47.110 align:start position:0%
are discouraging people
in

03:23:47.110 --> 03:23:47.120 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:23:50.710 --> 03:23:50.720 align:start position:0%
lopsided districts to not participate in
 
03:23:52.950 --> 03:23:52.960 align:start position:0%
the vote voting process
 
03:23:55.269 --> 03:23:55.279 align:start position:0%
and i would suggest that that does more
 
03:23:57.429 --> 03:23:57.439 align:start position:0%
harm to election integrity and some of
 
03:23:59.269 --> 03:23:59.279 align:start position:0%
the security measures that we've been
 
03:24:00.710 --> 03:24:00.720 align:start position:0%
