00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 align:start position:0%
the last one you heard last week
 
00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 align:start position:0%
not two weeks not last week on april 1st
 
00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 align:start position:0%
so thank you yeah
 
00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:56.390 align:start position:0%
so thank you yeah
okay

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 align:start position:0%
so really
 
00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 align:start position:0%
okay you have a handout um so
 
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 align:start position:0%
we've been doing this for a couple years
 
00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 align:start position:0%
now um and do you need a recap of what
 
00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 align:start position:0%
the bill is and everything why don't you
 
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 align:start position:0%
do that sure um so basically what we
 
00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 align:start position:0%
have is uh tax credit for businesses
 
00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 align:start position:0%
that are working with cte before you go
 
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 align:start position:0%
uh i i've asked representative burstein
 
00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
to be a replacement today so okay okay
 
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 align:start position:0%
so we have a tax credit available for
 
00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 align:start position:0%
businesses working with cte centers that
 
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 align:start position:0%
are donating time equipment um or money
 
00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 align:start position:0%
so it's it's typically 50
 
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 align:start position:0%
tax credit for businesses that are
 
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 align:start position:0%
donating time like um if they take on a
 
00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 align:start position:0%
student for an internship and they're
 
00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:38.319 align:start position:0%
paying them they can re they can get a
 
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 align:start position:0%
credit for that student's time um the
 
00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 align:start position:0%
the money that's paid to them and for
 
00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 align:start position:0%
the supervisor working with them um if
 
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 align:start position:0%
they're donating they can get a hundred
 
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 align:start position:0%
percent tax credit um and they get fifty
 
00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 align:start position:0%
percent tax credit for time put into
 
00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 align:start position:0%
creating training programs first so
 
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
equipment is is a hundred percent
 
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.910 align:start position:0%
equipment is is a hundred percent
correct

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.789 align:start position:0%
correct
time

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:03:58.789 --> 00:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
time fifty
 
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 align:start position:0%
and money is 50
 
00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 align:start position:0%
right and if they pay the stipend to the
 
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:07.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:10.159 align:start position:0%
um so that i mean general rundown is
 
00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 align:start position:0%
really um geared towards working with
 
00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 align:start position:0%
career and tech ed centers
 
00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 align:start position:0%
and in the last couple years it has been
 
00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.310 align:start position:0%
and in the last couple years it has been
utilized

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 align:start position:0%
utilized
 
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 align:start position:0%
2020 we were able to get
 
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 align:start position:0%
forms back for about 89 000
 
00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 align:start position:0%
and similar similarly for 2021 it was
 
00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 align:start position:0%
about 87 000
 
00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:31.759 align:start position:0%
and we're really hoping to see that
 
00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:34.479 align:start position:0%
number increase as we hopefully come out
 
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:36.400 align:start position:0%
of covid and have more students engaging
 
00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 align:start position:0%
in work-based learning
 
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 align:start position:0%
so um
 
00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 align:start position:0%
so i guess the statute says not to
 
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 align:start position:0%
exceed 500 000. correct
 
00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 align:start position:0%
right yep so we're not we're not close
 
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.080 align:start position:0%
to that no
 
00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 align:start position:0%
all right we would like to be closer
 
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
right and there's a couple ways we can
 
00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:55.040 align:start position:0%
get there one thing we've really uh
 
00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 align:start position:0%
increased is a lot of outreach and
 
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:59.110 align:start position:0%
increased is a lot of outreach and
communication

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 align:start position:0%
communication
 
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 align:start position:0%
both with the 29 regional career and
 
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 align:start position:0%
technical education centers and high
 
00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 align:start position:0%
schools but also a large part of
 
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:06.000 align:start position:0%
nicole's role with the department of
 
00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.080 align:start position:0%
education is to do direct outreach to
 
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 align:start position:0%
employers so nicole's spending a lot of
 
00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 align:start position:0%
time with employers saying you can take
 
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
advantage of this tax credit some of the
 
00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 align:start position:0%
pieces of equipment particularly for
 
00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 align:start position:0%
advanced manufacturing which is one of
 
00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 align:start position:0%
our main sectors in the state of new
 
00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 align:start position:0%
hampshire some of that equipment can run
 
00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 align:start position:0%
upwards of 150 200 000 for a piece of
 
00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
equipment so we could actually get here
 
00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 align:start position:0%
fairly quickly we just have to keep
 
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 align:start position:0%
getting the word out yeah yeah exactly
 
00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 align:start position:0%
have those forms turned in so that we
 
00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:32.240 align:start position:0%
can account for it so let's talk about
 
00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 align:start position:0%
you mentioned advanced manufacturing
 
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.790 align:start position:0%
you mentioned advanced manufacturing
so

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:38.479 align:start position:0%
you're talking about 3d printing you're
 
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:40.320 align:start position:0%
talking about
 
00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:43.039 align:start position:0%
robot arms uh yeah right yes
 
00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:46.400 align:start position:0%
3d printing absolutely robot arms uh
 
00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:49.039 align:start position:0%
cnc computer
 
00:05:51.749 --> 00:05:51.759 align:start position:0%
computer operated
 
00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:54.000 align:start position:0%
lathes mills
 
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:55.680 align:start position:0%
all those things that
 
00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 align:start position:0%
the the thing that makes cte unique in
 
00:05:59.749 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start position:0%
new hampshire
 
00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:01.360 align:start position:0%
at the high school level is that the
 
00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:02.880 align:start position:0%
kids are actually working on not on
 
00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 align:start position:0%
simulated or sort of toy versions
 
00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:06.080 align:start position:0%
they're working on the actual authentic
 
00:06:08.309 --> 00:06:08.319 align:start position:0%
equipment used in industry all right and
 
00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000 align:start position:0%
so for that reason it comes at that
 
00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 align:start position:0%
price tag that you see
 
00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 align:start position:0%
the company down the road that's that's
 
00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:16.639 align:start position:0%
buying a cnc router
 
00:06:18.309 --> 00:06:18.319 align:start position:0%
this high school that needs a cnc router
 
00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:21.520 align:start position:0%
at the same price tag right right
 
00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:25.270 align:start position:0%
at the same price tag right right
so

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:40.230 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 align:start position:0%
yeah um the last couple years most of
 
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:45.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:47.520 align:start position:0%
forms excuse me have come in from
 
00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:50.560 align:start position:0%

area

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:54.560 align:start position:0%
area
 
00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:56.720 align:start position:0%
and most of them have been for more of
 
00:06:59.029 --> 00:06:59.039 align:start position:0%
that time donation working with students
 
00:07:02.469 --> 00:07:02.479 align:start position:0%

00:07:05.029 --> 00:07:05.039 align:start position:0%
equipment donation forms as well but a
 
00:07:07.189 --> 00:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
lot of it has been that time and money
 
00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:09.199 align:start position:0%
component and i wish i had in front of
 
00:07:11.589 --> 00:07:11.599 align:start position:0%

00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:03.440 align:start position:0%
colebrook uh new hampshire that's our
 
00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.550 align:start position:0%
colebrook uh new hampshire that's our
newest

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:04.560 align:start position:0%
newest
 
00:08:06.309 --> 00:08:06.319 align:start position:0%
center that brings it to my name sorry
 
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:08.720 align:start position:0%
how about the north point ct center
 
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:14.560 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:17.360 align:start position:0%
and we have seen this year arms coming
 
00:08:19.589 --> 00:08:19.599 align:start position:0%
in from different centers as well so
 
00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:21.360 align:start position:0%
i've had a few come in from keene this
 
00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.469 align:start position:0%
i've had a few come in from keene this
year

00:08:22.469 --> 00:08:22.479 align:start position:0%
year
 
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:24.800 align:start position:0%
and definitely still the pinkerton
 
00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:28.960 align:start position:0%
academy and the milford cte center
 
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.710 align:start position:0%
academy and the milford cte center
so

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:30.720 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:08:47.509 --> 00:08:47.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
there was a slight dip uh one thing we
 
00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
do see is that we're pretty steady with
 
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:54.000 align:start position:0%
about 9500 students annually that are
 
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:55.760 align:start position:0%
taking part in cte
 
00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
um there have been
 
00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
across the state some some slight uh
 
00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%
dips but they've bounced back the
 
00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
enrollments are pretty robust for the
 
00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
upcoming year so it'll probably be about
 
00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
what we've seen that at 9 500.
 
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
one thing we do see is that although our
 
00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
high school enrollments continue to tick
 
00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
downward a little bit across the state
 
00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:18.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:20.310 align:start position:0%
so
this

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
let's clarify that then the the
 
00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's 9 500 students that are active
 
00:09:26.630 --> 00:09:26.640 align:start position:0%
with the cte program
 
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:30.000 align:start position:0%
and there's 21 29 locations
 
00:09:31.269 --> 00:09:31.279 align:start position:0%
so what
 
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:33.600 align:start position:0%
are the locations
 
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
existing schools or what are the what
 
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:37.920 align:start position:0%
are the locations
 
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:40.080 align:start position:0%
they're in existing schools so the cte
 
00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:42.160 align:start position:0%
centers are regional uh programs that
 
00:09:43.509 --> 00:09:43.519 align:start position:0%
are available to
 
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:44.880 align:start position:0%
students from sending high schools
 
00:09:46.389 --> 00:09:46.399 align:start position:0%
within the region right but they're
 
00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:49.040 align:start position:0%
housed within uh high schools so like
 
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:50.160 align:start position:0%
actually i think actually has one of
 
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:52.240 align:start position:0%
these yes yes
 
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:54.240 align:start position:0%
school technology is an expert right and
 
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:57.120 align:start position:0%
they do tend to be uh centered in uh
 
00:09:58.630 --> 00:09:58.640 align:start position:0%
more heavily populated areas so those
 
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:00.720 align:start position:0%
students that are more rural have access
 
00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:05.040 align:start position:0%
because they so so they they're um
 
00:10:06.550 --> 00:10:06.560 align:start position:0%
so what happens is you're still a
 
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:09.440 align:start position:0%
student at let's say exeter high school
 
00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:11.680 align:start position:0%
but you decide you want to be more
 
00:10:13.670 --> 00:10:13.680 align:start position:0%
technical person you would take classes
 
00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:14.800 align:start position:0%
through this
 
00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.360 align:start position:0%
but other districts would send as well
 
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:19.040 align:start position:0%
because it's a regional thing 90 minutes
 
00:10:19.990 --> 00:10:20.000 align:start position:0%
a day
 
00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:22.399 align:start position:0%
so 90 90 minutes a day 20 minutes a day
 
00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:24.320 align:start position:0%
and there's a really wide range of
 
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:26.800 align:start position:0%
programs some of our smaller centers
 
00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:27.750 align:start position:0%
programs some of our smaller centers
have

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:27.760 align:start position:0%
have
 
00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:29.680 align:start position:0%
six programs uh many of our larger
 
00:10:31.269 --> 00:10:31.279 align:start position:0%
centers uh that you'd see in in
 
00:10:33.190 --> 00:10:33.200 align:start position:0%
manchester nashville concord have
 
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
upwards of 15 the most that we have i
 
00:10:36.870 --> 00:10:36.880 align:start position:0%
think is
 
00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:38.320 align:start position:0%
might be pinkerton which i believe has
 
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.240 align:start position:0%
21. and it would be the centers that
 
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:43.120 align:start position:0%
reach out to the businesses to say hey
 
00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:44.399 align:start position:0%
yeah you know this is a real i mean to
 
00:10:47.110 --> 00:10:47.120 align:start position:0%
me this is a great program i mean
 
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:48.069 align:start position:0%
me this is a great program i mean
but

00:10:48.069 --> 00:10:48.079 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:49.920 align:start position:0%
because we need technique we need
 
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
in the work we need them surprise more
 
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:53.440 align:start position:0%
businesses haven't really jumped on this
 
00:10:55.350 --> 00:10:55.360 align:start position:0%
because we need to create people who
 
00:10:57.269 --> 00:10:57.279 align:start position:0%
know about this stuff
 
00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.829 align:start position:0%
know about this stuff
uh

00:10:58.829 --> 00:10:58.839 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:11:00.470 --> 00:11:00.480 align:start position:0%
locally continues to be that outreach
 
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:03.120 align:start position:0%
problem uh representative where uh the
 
00:11:04.870 --> 00:11:04.880 align:start position:0%
centers are beginning to do a better job
 
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.040 align:start position:0%
about it um one thing nicole has done
 
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
that's been great is giving them a
 
00:11:09.829 --> 00:11:09.839 align:start position:0%
little guidance to say it really has to
 
00:11:12.310 --> 00:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
be multi-tiered if you don't have a work
 
00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:13.760 align:start position:0%
based learning coordinator at the high
 
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:14.470 align:start position:0%
based learning coordinator at the high
school

00:11:14.470 --> 00:11:14.480 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:15.680 align:start position:0%
that it really
 
00:11:17.269 --> 00:11:17.279 align:start position:0%
ought to be the career technical
 
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:18.800 align:start position:0%
education director and individual
 
00:11:20.949 --> 00:11:20.959 align:start position:0%
teachers if you're in a a program that's
 
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:23.200 align:start position:0%
a more equipment-heavy program or if you
 
00:11:25.509 --> 00:11:25.519 align:start position:0%
have a need to have some folks coming in
 
00:11:27.269 --> 00:11:27.279 align:start position:0%
to work with your students or to have
 
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040 align:start position:0%
the internships the teacher can make
 
00:11:31.509 --> 00:11:31.519 align:start position:0%
that point of contact also every uh
 
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:33.920 align:start position:0%
every uh cte program in the state has a
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
program advisory committee uh typically
 
00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:38.880 align:start position:0%
made up of between five and ten industry
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
uh employers
 
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:42.720 align:start position:0%
and during those uh
 
00:11:44.150 --> 00:11:44.160 align:start position:0%
program advisory committee meetings
 
00:11:46.230 --> 00:11:46.240 align:start position:0%
which typically take place twice a year
 
00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600 align:start position:0%
there's an opportunity for them to put
 
00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:52.880 align:start position:0%
i know you don't have the list with you
 
00:11:54.150 --> 00:11:54.160 align:start position:0%
but it's something you can get back to
 
00:11:56.710 --> 00:11:56.720 align:start position:0%
us on is how many
 
00:11:58.949 --> 00:11:58.959 align:start position:0%
like last year how many businesses
 
00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:01.200 align:start position:0%
participated yeah actually i can give
 
00:12:05.910 --> 00:12:05.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:07.750 --> 00:12:07.760 align:start position:0%
it was so last year it was five
 
00:12:10.710 --> 00:12:10.720 align:start position:0%
different employers and 2020 was also
 
00:12:13.110 --> 00:12:13.120 align:start position:0%
five different employers
 
00:12:14.629 --> 00:12:14.639 align:start position:0%
we really would like that to be more and
 
00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:17.120 align:start position:0%
we're definitely working on it
 
00:12:18.550 --> 00:12:18.560 align:start position:0%
yeah i mean there's i mean there's a
 
00:12:20.710 --> 00:12:20.720 align:start position:0%
real opportunity here it's huge yeah
 
00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:26.629 align:start position:0%
real opportunity here it's huge yeah
absolutely

00:12:26.629 --> 00:12:26.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:12:29.190 --> 00:12:29.200 align:start position:0%
some of them are um there's we have like
 
00:12:32.949 --> 00:12:32.959 align:start position:0%
l3 harris um lucas mediterranean cafe
 
00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:35.040 align:start position:0%
new england document
 
00:12:37.190 --> 00:12:37.200 align:start position:0%
fit new hampshire fisher cats is on here
 
00:12:39.269 --> 00:12:39.279 align:start position:0%
there's a few bigger names um and then
 
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:41.360 align:start position:0%
some smaller businesses as well
 
00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:44.399 align:start position:0%
yeah but like fish cat's not i envision
 
00:12:46.949 --> 00:12:46.959 align:start position:0%
manufacturing for some reason yeah
 
00:12:48.629 --> 00:12:48.639 align:start position:0%
as being where you where
 
00:12:51.190 --> 00:12:51.200 align:start position:0%
you want to go because it's technical
 
00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:53.120 align:start position:0%
i'm not sure what the fisher cats
 
00:12:55.110 --> 00:12:55.120 align:start position:0%
well well we
 
00:12:56.870 --> 00:12:56.880 align:start position:0%
yeah well there's an array of different
 
00:12:58.949 --> 00:12:58.959 align:start position:0%
programs in the cte center so there's
 
00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:01.200 align:start position:0%
culinary oh the culinary product we can
 
00:13:07.750 --> 00:13:07.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:09.269 --> 00:13:09.279 align:start position:0%
okay got it
 
00:13:09.279 --> 00:13:10.470 align:start position:0%
okay got it
yeah

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:10.480 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:13:14.629 --> 00:13:14.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:15.600 align:start position:0%
and and
 
00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:17.519 align:start position:0%
but this is and how long is the program
 
00:13:19.269 --> 00:13:19.279 align:start position:0%
uh look on that how long has it been
 
00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:21.440 align:start position:0%
around since 2019
 
00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:23.200 align:start position:0%
yeah 19. so this is not that all right
 
00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:25.360 align:start position:0%
there's nothing at all yeah
 
00:13:25.360 --> 00:13:26.790 align:start position:0%
there's nothing at all yeah
so

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:26.800 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:32.790 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:13:32.790 --> 00:13:32.800 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:37.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:39.509 --> 00:13:39.519 align:start position:0%
and do you have a number for 2020 yep it
 
00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:41.560 align:start position:0%
was 87
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
435 and 5 cents
 
00:13:46.949 --> 00:13:46.959 align:start position:0%
i hate to put you on the spot but
 
00:13:49.829 --> 00:13:49.839 align:start position:0%
you said it's trending up this year
 
00:13:52.389 --> 00:13:52.399 align:start position:0%
right now i wish i could say yes it's
 
00:13:53.990 --> 00:13:54.000 align:start position:0%
honestly a little bit lower than i would
 
00:13:55.910 --> 00:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
want it to be right now so i'm hoping
 
00:13:57.430 --> 00:13:57.440 align:start position:0%
and what happens a lot of times is we
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
get a lot of donation forms closer to
 
00:14:01.430 --> 00:14:01.440 align:start position:0%
the end of june so fingers crossed and
 
00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:04.160 align:start position:0%
the deadline is june 30. june 30th
 
00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:05.430 align:start position:0%
the deadline is june 30. june 30th
correct

00:14:05.430 --> 00:14:05.440 align:start position:0%
correct
 
00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:08.800 align:start position:0%
is there a reporting requirement
 
00:14:10.550 --> 00:14:10.560 align:start position:0%
yeah we do have to do a report to the
 
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:12.320 align:start position:0%
legislative legislation at the end of
 
00:14:18.629 --> 00:14:18.639 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:18.639 --> 00:14:19.509 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:14:19.509 --> 00:14:19.519 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:14:22.629 --> 00:14:22.639 align:start position:0%
yeah it should be in by um let's see
 
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:24.800 align:start position:0%
october 1st is when we have to have that
 
00:14:28.310 --> 00:14:28.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:29.990 --> 00:14:30.000 align:start position:0%
yes well i'm reading that i'm reading
 
00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:31.839 align:start position:0%
the statute here at the end
 
00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:34.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:36.480 align:start position:0%
on october 1st of each year the
 
00:14:38.389 --> 00:14:38.399 align:start position:0%
department of education shall report to
 
00:14:40.069 --> 00:14:40.079 align:start position:0%
the speaker of the house
 
00:14:42.069 --> 00:14:42.079 align:start position:0%
representatives the senate president
 
00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:44.000 align:start position:0%
and the chairpersons of house and senate
 
00:14:45.590 --> 00:14:45.600 align:start position:0%
ways of means yes
 
00:14:46.949 --> 00:14:46.959 align:start position:0%
correct so we should technically be
 
00:14:49.110 --> 00:14:49.120 align:start position:0%
getting this yeah and you should have it
 
00:14:51.509 --> 00:14:51.519 align:start position:0%
um we we honestly had
 
00:14:52.949 --> 00:14:52.959 align:start position:0%
we're a little bit confused on where to
 
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:54.480 align:start position:0%
send the report so they didn't
 
00:14:56.069 --> 00:14:56.079 align:start position:0%
necessarily get right to you all but we
 
00:14:57.430 --> 00:14:57.440 align:start position:0%
did resend them
 
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:00.480 align:start position:0%
when like january it was january january
 
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
we had a leadership change and some
 
00:15:03.269 --> 00:15:03.279 align:start position:0%
things got lost okay so we have the
 
00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:06.800 align:start position:0%
october and the yeah i mean the the two
 
00:15:08.550 --> 00:15:08.560 align:start position:0%
right on me
 
00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:10.550 align:start position:0%
right on me
yeah

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:10.560 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:15:47.189 --> 00:15:47.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:47.199 --> 00:16:19.829 align:start position:0%
 
uh

00:16:19.829 --> 00:16:19.839 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:19.839 --> 00:16:20.870 align:start position:0%
 
yes

00:16:20.870 --> 00:16:20.880 align:start position:0%
yes
 
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:26.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:28.230 --> 00:16:28.240 align:start position:0%
okay so we have the exact numbers and
 
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:30.320 align:start position:0%
everything here yep
 
00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:31.920 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah
 
00:16:39.189 --> 00:16:39.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:16:41.189 --> 00:16:41.199 align:start position:0%
as it stands now the program is
 
00:16:44.069 --> 00:16:44.079 align:start position:0%
scheduled to be repealed
 
00:16:46.389 --> 00:16:46.399 align:start position:0%
it said that but then it all we also saw
 
00:16:48.790 --> 00:16:48.800 align:start position:0%
that it was maybe um
 
00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:52.480 align:start position:0%
extended through 2026 and um
 
00:16:54.069 --> 00:16:54.079 align:start position:0%
that's that's the newest wording we've
 
00:16:54.079 --> 00:16:56.150 align:start position:0%
that's that's the newest wording we've
seen

00:16:56.150 --> 00:16:56.160 align:start position:0%
seen
 
00:16:59.110 --> 00:16:59.120 align:start position:0%
well i see here
 
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:04.160 align:start position:0%
rsa 188 being repealed
 
00:17:08.230 --> 00:17:08.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.510 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:17:09.510 --> 00:17:09.520 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:12.309 --> 00:17:12.319 align:start position:0%
right the repeals effective june 30th
 
00:17:12.319 --> 00:17:19.590 align:start position:0%
right the repeals effective june 30th
2026

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:19.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.789 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:17:20.789 --> 00:17:20.799 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:22.000 align:start position:0%
it sounds like we got to hustle a little
 
00:17:24.069 --> 00:17:24.079 align:start position:0%
bit here
 
00:17:25.429 --> 00:17:25.439 align:start position:0%
it's going to be repealed before you
 
00:17:26.549 --> 00:17:26.559 align:start position:0%
know it
 
00:17:26.559 --> 00:17:27.510 align:start position:0%
know it
so

00:17:27.510 --> 00:17:27.520 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:28.390 align:start position:0%
so
okay

00:17:28.390 --> 00:17:28.400 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.950 align:start position:0%
okay
um

00:17:30.950 --> 00:17:30.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:33.590 --> 00:17:33.600 align:start position:0%
you you would think
 
00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:36.080 align:start position:0%
so the as department of education i mean
 
00:17:38.710 --> 00:17:38.720 align:start position:0%
uh i mean vocational
 
00:17:42.789 --> 00:17:42.799 align:start position:0%
training is as important as oh yeah as
 
00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:45.600 align:start position:0%
you know going uh college uh kind of
 
00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.789 align:start position:0%
you know going uh college uh kind of
training

00:17:46.789 --> 00:17:46.799 align:start position:0%
training
 
00:17:48.470 --> 00:17:48.480 align:start position:0%
uh especially now with the job short you
 
00:17:50.230 --> 00:17:50.240 align:start position:0%
know with the employee shortages it's
 
00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.510 align:start position:0%
know with the employee shortages it's
like

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
like
 
00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:52.470 align:start position:0%
like
um

00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:52.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:17:54.950 --> 00:17:54.960 align:start position:0%
so i i guess the question is
 
00:17:55.750 --> 00:17:55.760 align:start position:0%
i mean
 
00:17:57.669 --> 00:17:57.679 align:start position:0%
you think you said you you
 
00:17:59.270 --> 00:17:59.280 align:start position:0%
you had to
 
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:00.880 align:start position:0%
put up the heat a little bit and get
 
00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:02.070 align:start position:0%
put up the heat a little bit and get
this

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:02.080 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:03.760 align:start position:0%
somehow get this more organized to get
 
00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:04.549 align:start position:0%
somehow get this more organized to get
the

00:18:04.549 --> 00:18:04.559 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:18:05.990 --> 00:18:06.000 align:start position:0%
to get the
 
00:18:08.470 --> 00:18:08.480 align:start position:0%
businesses more involved i think one of
 
00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:10.320 align:start position:0%
the things that i had said i wanted to
 
00:18:12.390 --> 00:18:12.400 align:start position:0%
try was potentially reaching out to the
 
00:18:14.230 --> 00:18:14.240 align:start position:0%
centers and asking if i could reach out
 
00:18:16.150 --> 00:18:16.160 align:start position:0%
to their businesses directly
 
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
to see if i could help collect some of
 
00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:18.880 align:start position:0%
that information and move it along a
 
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:20.400 align:start position:0%
little bit
 
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:21.270 align:start position:0%
little bit
yeah

00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:21.280 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.870 align:start position:0%
yeah
no

00:18:22.870 --> 00:18:22.880 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:18:24.549 --> 00:18:24.559 align:start position:0%
well they what do they do they probably
 
00:18:25.909 --> 00:18:25.919 align:start position:0%
reach out to businesses that are in a
 
00:18:27.430 --> 00:18:27.440 align:start position:0%
general area right obviously because
 
00:18:28.710 --> 00:18:28.720 align:start position:0%
there's travel issues the kids they
 
00:18:30.549 --> 00:18:30.559 align:start position:0%
can't travel you know halfway across the
 
00:18:30.559 --> 00:18:31.669 align:start position:0%
can't travel you know halfway across the
state

00:18:31.669 --> 00:18:31.679 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:18:31.679 --> 00:18:32.710 align:start position:0%
state
um

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:32.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:35.029 --> 00:18:35.039 align:start position:0%
so and and then
 
00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:36.720 align:start position:0%
they pretty well these
 
00:18:40.390 --> 00:18:40.400 align:start position:0%
the the current 29 centers
 
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.270 align:start position:0%
the the current 29 centers
are

00:18:41.270 --> 00:18:41.280 align:start position:0%
are
 
00:18:42.789 --> 00:18:42.799 align:start position:0%
kind of distributed across the state
 
00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:43.840 align:start position:0%
pretty well they're very well
 
00:18:46.470 --> 00:18:46.480 align:start position:0%
distributed they if you if you look at
 
00:18:49.750 --> 00:18:49.760 align:start position:0%
uh south to north they are uh clustered
 
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:51.360 align:start position:0%
in population centers so there are more
 
00:18:52.710 --> 00:18:52.720 align:start position:0%
centers in the southern part of the
 
00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:53.510 align:start position:0%
centers in the southern part of the
state

00:18:53.510 --> 00:18:53.520 align:start position:0%
state
 
00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:54.880 align:start position:0%
uh but we're pretty well well
 
00:18:56.310 --> 00:18:56.320 align:start position:0%
represented in the north country with
 
00:18:56.320 --> 00:18:57.110 align:start position:0%
represented in the north country with
six

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.120 align:start position:0%
six
 
00:18:59.430 --> 00:18:59.440 align:start position:0%
cte centers that are that are all up
 
00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.360 align:start position:0%
right in the northern part
 
00:19:03.270 --> 00:19:03.280 align:start position:0%
we also have a number of centers that
 
00:19:04.630 --> 00:19:04.640 align:start position:0%
are located in vermont where some new
 
00:19:06.070 --> 00:19:06.080 align:start position:0%
hampshire students take
 
00:19:07.990 --> 00:19:08.000 align:start position:0%
cte in vermont
 
00:19:09.029 --> 00:19:09.039 align:start position:0%
but we
 
00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480 align:start position:0%
the vermont centers don't qualify for
 
00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:11.600 align:start position:0%
this uh
 
00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:14.000 align:start position:0%
for the thing obviously
 
00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:16.320 align:start position:0%
so of the 29 some of them are in vermont
 
00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:18.480 align:start position:0%
uh the the 29 is new hampshire in new
 
00:19:19.990 --> 00:19:20.000 align:start position:0%
hampshire oh but there's also a vermont
 
00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
one okay yeah and to date we don't have
 
00:19:23.830 --> 00:19:23.840 align:start position:0%
any vermont students attending in new
 
00:19:25.110 --> 00:19:25.120 align:start position:0%
hampshire but that will change with the
 
00:19:27.669 --> 00:19:27.679 align:start position:0%
cold work center coming on board oh okay
 
00:19:30.150 --> 00:19:30.160 align:start position:0%
right over the border there yeah yeah
 
00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.350 align:start position:0%
right over the border there yeah yeah
so

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:31.360 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.590 align:start position:0%
so
okay

00:19:35.590 --> 00:19:35.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:38.549 --> 00:19:38.559 align:start position:0%
we have tax credits to
 
00:19:38.559 --> 00:19:41.029 align:start position:0%
we have tax credits to
encourage

00:19:41.029 --> 00:19:41.039 align:start position:0%
encourage
 
00:19:44.470 --> 00:19:44.480 align:start position:0%
giving behavior that wouldn't otherwise
 
00:19:47.430 --> 00:19:47.440 align:start position:0%
occur i mean that's sort of the idea
 
00:19:49.110 --> 00:19:49.120 align:start position:0%
there's a public
 
00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720 align:start position:0%
purpose that's served and
 
00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.710 align:start position:0%
purpose that's served and
and

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:54.720 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:19:56.310 --> 00:19:56.320 align:start position:0%
is served by
 
00:19:59.669 --> 00:19:59.679 align:start position:0%
violet uh tax credits by these
 
00:20:02.549 --> 00:20:02.559 align:start position:0%
and so the question here is uh
 
00:20:04.230 --> 00:20:04.240 align:start position:0%
the participation rate has been pretty
 
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.470 align:start position:0%
the participation rate has been pretty
low

00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:06.480 align:start position:0%
low
 
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:11.760 align:start position:0%
well i guess two questions one has there
 
00:20:16.149 --> 00:20:16.159 align:start position:0%
been and is there continuing to be gifts
 
00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:18.720 align:start position:0%
coming from businesses that where the
 
00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:20.400 align:start position:0%
businesses don't bother with the tax
 
00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.750 align:start position:0%
businesses don't bother with the tax
credits

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
credits
 
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:23.520 align:start position:0%
you know maybe that's happening i don't
 
00:20:26.070 --> 00:20:26.080 align:start position:0%
know uh yeah
 
00:20:27.350 --> 00:20:27.360 align:start position:0%
it is
 
00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
i think that is likely happening i will
 
00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
say though that the amount of paperwork
 
00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
is not onerous it's not an additional
 
00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
burden on the very straightforward
 
00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
process so i don't i don't think that's
 
00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
a barrier to participation i really
 
00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
think probably it's really just
 
00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
um not front of mind for a lot of the
 
00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
folks that maybe are giving gifts
 
00:20:46.470 --> 00:20:46.480 align:start position:0%
so again it just goes back to our
 
00:20:48.950 --> 00:20:48.960 align:start position:0%
needing to double down on outreach and
 
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:50.640 align:start position:0%
making sure that nicole
 
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:53.120 align:start position:0%
continues to let employers know and that
 
00:20:54.870 --> 00:20:54.880 align:start position:0%
also that the cte center is continuing
 
00:20:56.549 --> 00:20:56.559 align:start position:0%
to let employers know what we really
 
00:20:58.950 --> 00:20:58.960 align:start position:0%
don't want to happen is that
 
00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:00.960 align:start position:0%
businesses that have been giving as a
 
00:21:02.789 --> 00:21:02.799 align:start position:0%
routine thing this is what they do in
 
00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:04.159 align:start position:0%
the community
 
00:21:04.159 --> 00:21:05.830 align:start position:0%
the community
um

00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:05.840 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:21:07.430 --> 00:21:07.440 align:start position:0%
learning that there's a tax credit
 
00:21:10.149 --> 00:21:10.159 align:start position:0%
available oh boy
 
00:21:12.789 --> 00:21:12.799 align:start position:0%
now that's a lower amount in our budget
 
00:21:12.799 --> 00:21:13.830 align:start position:0%
now that's a lower amount in our budget
net

00:21:13.830 --> 00:21:13.840 align:start position:0%
net
 
00:21:16.470 --> 00:21:16.480 align:start position:0%
of the tax credit and there's no no
 
00:21:19.190 --> 00:21:19.200 align:start position:0%
change you know and same same
 
00:21:21.110 --> 00:21:21.120 align:start position:0%
position we were at when we started out
 
00:21:22.789 --> 00:21:22.799 align:start position:0%
the program except there's a little more
 
00:21:26.549 --> 00:21:26.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:21:28.310 --> 00:21:28.320 align:start position:0%
so do you have any sense about that i
 
00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:29.029 align:start position:0%
so do you have any sense about that i
mean

00:21:29.029 --> 00:21:29.039 align:start position:0%
mean
 
00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
is there any shifting over in this same
 
00:21:33.830 --> 00:21:33.840 align:start position:0%
level of giving
 
00:21:36.149 --> 00:21:36.159 align:start position:0%
um not that i've heard of i've honestly
 
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.080 align:start position:0%
i've heard of centers still receiving
 
00:21:40.230 --> 00:21:40.240 align:start position:0%
donations and
 
00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:41.679 align:start position:0%
having students be able to do
 
00:21:43.669 --> 00:21:43.679 align:start position:0%
internships and honestly been trying to
 
00:21:45.990 --> 00:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
figure out why they're not using
 
00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:47.840 align:start position:0%
this credit so that's something that
 
00:21:48.789 --> 00:21:48.799 align:start position:0%
i've been
 
00:21:50.470 --> 00:21:50.480 align:start position:0%
really trying to hunker down on and say
 
00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:52.000 align:start position:0%
you know we have this why aren't we
 
00:21:54.470 --> 00:21:54.480 align:start position:0%
seeing the forms come in
 
00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:56.240 align:start position:0%
and you know offering my assistance in
 
00:21:58.470 --> 00:21:58.480 align:start position:0%
any way possible to make sure we get
 
00:22:00.710 --> 00:22:00.720 align:start position:0%
those forms and really we can't do much
 
00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:03.200 align:start position:0%
without the paperwork
 
00:22:04.789 --> 00:22:04.799 align:start position:0%
i think this is saying something dick to
 
00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:05.430 align:start position:0%
i think this is saying something dick to
us

00:22:05.430 --> 00:22:05.440 align:start position:0%
us
 
00:22:07.270 --> 00:22:07.280 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit it's saying that some
 
00:22:09.110 --> 00:22:09.120 align:start position:0%
of these businesses are just happy to
 
00:22:10.149 --> 00:22:10.159 align:start position:0%
have the
 
00:22:12.710 --> 00:22:12.720 align:start position:0%
you know these students come in and even
 
00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.830 align:start position:0%
you know these students come in and even
donate

00:22:13.830 --> 00:22:13.840 align:start position:0%
donate
 
00:22:15.909 --> 00:22:15.919 align:start position:0%
because they know that they need
 
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:17.440 align:start position:0%
because that for them they're hard they
 
00:22:18.789 --> 00:22:18.799 align:start position:0%
can harvest them
 
00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:20.320 align:start position:0%
when they graduate
 
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:22.960 align:start position:0%
to do the work uh you know
 
00:22:24.149 --> 00:22:24.159 align:start position:0%
there's nothing like putting them in a
 
00:22:25.590 --> 00:22:25.600 align:start position:0%
position and then they get to evaluate
 
00:22:27.270 --> 00:22:27.280 align:start position:0%
them too
 
00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:29.760 align:start position:0%
as to you know whether they you know
 
00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:32.240 align:start position:0%
would cut it you know and uh when they
 
00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.510 align:start position:0%
would cut it you know and uh when they
graduated

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
graduated
 
00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
so it's so they just probably just find
 
00:22:37.590 --> 00:22:37.600 align:start position:0%
it as a
 
00:22:38.950 --> 00:22:38.960 align:start position:0%
you know something that's advantageous
 
00:22:40.230 --> 00:22:40.240 align:start position:0%
to them without filling out the
 
00:22:41.590 --> 00:22:41.600 align:start position:0%
paperwork and
 
00:22:43.909 --> 00:22:43.919 align:start position:0%
and do all of that but
 
00:22:45.590 --> 00:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
so i i don't know i don't know it's an
 
00:22:47.669 --> 00:22:47.679 align:start position:0%
interesting question yeah
 
00:22:47.679 --> 00:22:51.830 align:start position:0%
interesting question yeah
um

00:22:51.830 --> 00:22:51.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:22:53.830 --> 00:22:53.840 align:start position:0%
didn't the fisher cats just rebrand to
 
00:22:55.909 --> 00:22:55.919 align:start position:0%
like the chicken tenders or something
 
00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:05.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:07.029 align:start position:0%
 
any

00:23:07.029 --> 00:23:07.039 align:start position:0%
any
 
00:23:09.669 --> 00:23:09.679 align:start position:0%
they idea with the fish again i don't
 
00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:12.080 align:start position:0%
know but i can certainly probably figure
 
00:23:13.590 --> 00:23:13.600 align:start position:0%
that out i just have to go back to the
 
00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:15.280 align:start position:0%
center and ask
 
00:23:16.870 --> 00:23:16.880 align:start position:0%
that is something that we're really
 
00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:17.840 align:start position:0%
interested in the department of
 
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:19.600 align:start position:0%
education and expanding
 
00:23:21.110 --> 00:23:21.120 align:start position:0%
internships as a part of work-based
 
00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:24.080 align:start position:0%
learning and as part of that we're right
 
00:23:25.750 --> 00:23:25.760 align:start position:0%
in the middle of developing some data
 
00:23:27.590 --> 00:23:27.600 align:start position:0%
collection systems because right now we
 
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:29.520 align:start position:0%
don't have a way to collect valid
 
00:23:31.190 --> 00:23:31.200 align:start position:0%
reliable data about what students do
 
00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.149 align:start position:0%
reliable data about what students do
after

00:23:32.149 --> 00:23:32.159 align:start position:0%
after
 
00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
cte that's something we really have a
 
00:23:35.510 --> 00:23:35.520 align:start position:0%
strong interest in because we want to
 
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:36.720 align:start position:0%
make sure that a
 
00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:38.480 align:start position:0%
these kids stay in new hampshire would
 
00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:40.400 align:start position:0%
be are working in the area that they
 
00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:41.750 align:start position:0%
be are working in the area that they
studied

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:41.760 align:start position:0%
studied
 
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:43.360 align:start position:0%
i think it's also a selling point to
 
00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:46.240 align:start position:0%
grow the program yeah hey and we also
 
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
something kind of cool we have passed
 
00:23:51.269 --> 00:23:51.279 align:start position:0%
back in december of 2021
 
00:23:53.430 --> 00:23:53.440 align:start position:0%
by gnc a new program with a
 
00:23:55.190 --> 00:23:55.200 align:start position:0%
reimbursement or a wage match for
 
00:23:57.350 --> 00:23:57.360 align:start position:0%
employers that they could also you know
 
00:23:58.789 --> 00:23:58.799 align:start position:0%
potentially use hand in hand with this
 
00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:00.880 align:start position:0%
tax credit to to give them more
 
00:24:02.950 --> 00:24:02.960 align:start position:0%
incentive to work with students as well
 
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:06.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:09.269 --> 00:24:09.279 align:start position:0%
so the did the students get
 
00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:10.799 align:start position:0%
this is a random question do the
 
00:24:13.669 --> 00:24:13.679 align:start position:0%
students get uh credits
 
00:24:13.679 --> 00:24:13.960 align:start position:0%
students get uh credits
for

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:13.970 align:start position:0%
for
 
00:24:13.970 --> 00:24:16.630 align:start position:0%
for
[Music]

00:24:16.630 --> 00:24:16.640 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:19.360 align:start position:0%
in some situations yes sometimes no it
 
00:24:20.789 --> 00:24:20.799 align:start position:0%
depends on the school and if they're
 
00:24:20.799 --> 00:24:21.750 align:start position:0%
depends on the school and if they're
offering

00:24:21.750 --> 00:24:21.760 align:start position:0%
offering
 
00:24:24.549 --> 00:24:24.559 align:start position:0%
um credit for that experience um i want
 
00:24:25.990 --> 00:24:26.000 align:start position:0%
to say most of the time they would be
 
00:24:27.909 --> 00:24:27.919 align:start position:0%
getting some sort of credit
 
00:24:28.950 --> 00:24:28.960 align:start position:0%
generally speaking of some sort of
 
00:24:31.269 --> 00:24:31.279 align:start position:0%
elective credit yeah
 
00:24:33.669 --> 00:24:33.679 align:start position:0%
so i the university of buffalo found me
 
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:35.600 align:start position:0%
i was when i went to school
 
00:24:37.029 --> 00:24:37.039 align:start position:0%
10 years ago so i'm on the dean's
 
00:24:38.390 --> 00:24:38.400 align:start position:0%
advisory council for the engineering
 
00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:39.190 align:start position:0%
advisory council for the engineering
school

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:39.200 align:start position:0%
school
 
00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:41.120 align:start position:0%
and experiential learning is
 
00:24:43.190 --> 00:24:43.200 align:start position:0%
is up there
 
00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:44.840 align:start position:0%
that they want you
 
00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:46.960 align:start position:0%
know and
 
00:24:49.350 --> 00:24:49.360 align:start position:0%
most of the programs do have
 
00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:50.799 align:start position:0%
you know it's like a day or two a week
 
00:24:50.799 --> 00:24:51.669 align:start position:0%
you know it's like a day or two a week
that

00:24:51.669 --> 00:24:51.679 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:24:54.070 --> 00:24:54.080 align:start position:0%
they would they would work with a local
 
00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.269 align:start position:0%
they would they would work with a local
business

00:24:55.269 --> 00:24:55.279 align:start position:0%
business
 
00:24:56.950 --> 00:24:56.960 align:start position:0%
and there's nobody exchanges hands the
 
00:24:58.630 --> 00:24:58.640 align:start position:0%
business is happy to have them just like
 
00:25:00.789 --> 00:25:00.799 align:start position:0%
we were talking about and but the kids
 
00:25:02.789 --> 00:25:02.799 align:start position:0%
do get credits for that you know a
 
00:25:05.269 --> 00:25:05.279 align:start position:0%
credit or whatever it is for that yeah
 
00:25:05.279 --> 00:25:06.230 align:start position:0%
credit or whatever it is for that yeah
so

00:25:06.230 --> 00:25:06.240 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.430 align:start position:0%
so
um

00:25:07.430 --> 00:25:07.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
well i think too we shouldn't lose sight
 
00:25:11.110 --> 00:25:11.120 align:start position:0%
of the the equipment donation which is
 
00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:13.520 align:start position:0%
really a big part of this program and a
 
00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520 align:start position:0%
key part of this program because the the
 
00:25:16.870 --> 00:25:16.880 align:start position:0%
equipment is
 
00:25:18.630 --> 00:25:18.640 align:start position:0%
the the state of new hampshire receives
 
00:25:20.549 --> 00:25:20.559 align:start position:0%
about six million dollars in federal
 
00:25:22.070 --> 00:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
perkins money every year but that
 
00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:23.600 align:start position:0%
federal perkins money
 
00:25:27.430 --> 00:25:27.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:25:29.269 --> 00:25:29.279 align:start position:0%
a little bit per center you know we have
 
00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120 align:start position:0%
29 centers there there's about five
 
00:25:33.190 --> 00:25:33.200 align:start position:0%
million that goes out in distribution
 
00:25:34.789 --> 00:25:34.799 align:start position:0%
the community college system and the
 
00:25:36.549 --> 00:25:36.559 align:start position:0%
high schools and so at the end of the
 
00:25:38.390 --> 00:25:38.400 align:start position:0%
day um some of our
 
00:25:41.909 --> 00:25:41.919 align:start position:0%
less resourced centers claremont newport
 
00:25:43.430 --> 00:25:43.440 align:start position:0%
some of our our centers in the north
 
00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.549 align:start position:0%
some of our our centers in the north
country

00:25:44.549 --> 00:25:44.559 align:start position:0%
country
 
00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:46.720 align:start position:0%
are really receiving less than 100 000
 
00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:49.360 align:start position:0%
in an annual perkins allocation if a
 
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:50.960 align:start position:0%
piece of advanced manufacturing
 
00:25:53.430 --> 00:25:53.440 align:start position:0%
equipment costs 150 000 that's overall
 
00:25:54.789 --> 00:25:54.799 align:start position:0%
allocation per year they can't spend
 
00:25:57.669 --> 00:25:57.679 align:start position:0%
that money underneath my mind
 
00:25:59.110 --> 00:25:59.120 align:start position:0%
well i mean these 3d printers aren't
 
00:25:59.120 --> 00:26:00.789 align:start position:0%
well i mean these 3d printers aren't
cheap

00:26:00.789 --> 00:26:00.799 align:start position:0%
cheap
 
00:26:05.269 --> 00:26:05.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:26:06.870 --> 00:26:06.880 align:start position:0%
well it's a whole other area right they
 
00:26:09.430 --> 00:26:09.440 align:start position:0%
do auto
 
00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.950 align:start position:0%
do auto
well

00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:10.960 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:26:12.870 --> 00:26:12.880 align:start position:0%
auto mechanics are now auto
 
00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600 align:start position:0%
technicians yes literally
 
00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:19.600 align:start position:0%
uh it's all electronic right i mean
 
00:26:21.190 --> 00:26:21.200 align:start position:0%
so i said where's the dipstick in my car
 
00:26:22.370 --> 00:26:22.380 align:start position:0%
there's no dipstick
 
00:26:22.380 --> 00:26:28.710 align:start position:0%
there's no dipstick
[Laughter]

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:28.720 align:start position:0%
[Laughter]
 
00:26:30.710 --> 00:26:30.720 align:start position:0%
when i first bought my car that you know
 
00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:32.960 align:start position:0%
the ones you have the setting that the
 
00:26:34.230 --> 00:26:34.240 align:start position:0%
when you stop at a red light the engine
 
00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.430 align:start position:0%
when you stop at a red light the engine
stops

00:26:35.430 --> 00:26:35.440 align:start position:0%
stops
 
00:26:37.029 --> 00:26:37.039 align:start position:0%
i go that's that's got to be tough on
 
00:26:38.950 --> 00:26:38.960 align:start position:0%
the starter what's starter we don't have
 
00:26:41.350 --> 00:26:41.360 align:start position:0%
starters it's just a solenoid or some
 
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:42.320 align:start position:0%
kind of thing
 
00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:44.480 align:start position:0%
i said wow bob i'll put a different
 
00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:45.990 align:start position:0%
i said wow bob i'll put a different
error

00:26:45.990 --> 00:26:46.000 align:start position:0%
error
 
00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:47.430 align:start position:0%
error
so

00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:47.440 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:26:49.110 --> 00:26:49.120 align:start position:0%
it is remarkable some of our centers
 
00:26:51.029 --> 00:26:51.039 align:start position:0%
that offer within their auto tech
 
00:26:53.269 --> 00:26:53.279 align:start position:0%
program multiple uh certifications from
 
00:26:55.669 --> 00:26:55.679 align:start position:0%
different employers so you could have a
 
00:26:57.110 --> 00:26:57.120 align:start position:0%
young person who decides to concentrate
 
00:26:58.950 --> 00:26:58.960 align:start position:0%
on toyotas or someone else that decides
 
00:27:01.430 --> 00:27:01.440 align:start position:0%
to concentrate on forwards and
 
00:27:03.110 --> 00:27:03.120 align:start position:0%
be ready to work for that dealership
 
00:27:04.390 --> 00:27:04.400 align:start position:0%
when they come out and the dealerships
 
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:06.960 align:start position:0%
are thrilled to get them yeah
 
00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.350 align:start position:0%
are thrilled to get them yeah
yeah

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:09.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:12.310 --> 00:27:12.320 align:start position:0%
you can't say toyota to a ford guy
 
00:27:13.350 --> 00:27:13.360 align:start position:0%
so i had
 
00:27:15.190 --> 00:27:15.200 align:start position:0%
one of my committees that buffalo we
 
00:27:17.110 --> 00:27:17.120 align:start position:0%
have a guy that's was worked for four
 
00:27:18.549 --> 00:27:18.559 align:start position:0%
for 30 years
 
00:27:21.110 --> 00:27:21.120 align:start position:0%
someone brought up toyota
 
00:27:23.750 --> 00:27:23.760 align:start position:0%
he flinched four or five yeah well
 
00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:25.029 align:start position:0%
he flinched four or five yeah well
anyway

00:27:25.029 --> 00:27:25.039 align:start position:0%
anyway
 
00:27:27.750 --> 00:27:27.760 align:start position:0%
so okay um
 
00:27:30.149 --> 00:27:30.159 align:start position:0%
let's just one more second looking at
 
00:27:36.789 --> 00:27:36.799 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.310 --> 00:27:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
00:27:58.320 --> 00:27:59.190 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:27:59.190 --> 00:27:59.200 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:01.110 --> 00:28:01.120 align:start position:0%
i will tell you for this year we already
 
00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:04.000 align:start position:0%
have more businesses
 
00:28:06.950 --> 00:28:06.960 align:start position:0%
that are use using the credit um but
 
00:28:08.630 --> 00:28:08.640 align:start position:0%
right now we're definitely at less than
 
00:28:10.710 --> 00:28:10.720 align:start position:0%
the 87. it's funny we have about 12
 
00:28:13.430 --> 00:28:13.440 align:start position:0%
businesses utilizing it but for less
 
00:28:16.549 --> 00:28:16.559 align:start position:0%
like smaller amounts of money i see yeah
 
00:28:16.559 --> 00:28:17.909 align:start position:0%
like smaller amounts of money i see yeah
yeah

00:28:17.909 --> 00:28:17.919 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:19.440 align:start position:0%
and that's it
 
00:28:22.630 --> 00:28:22.640 align:start position:0%
and all these are uh
 
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.710 align:start position:0%
and all these are uh
um

00:28:24.710 --> 00:28:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:28:27.510 --> 00:28:27.520 align:start position:0%
benefiting pinkerton academy's programs
 
00:28:33.350 --> 00:28:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:35.669 --> 00:28:35.679 align:start position:0%
and this year we we have um
 
00:28:36.950 --> 00:28:36.960 align:start position:0%
you know three
 
00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:39.360 align:start position:0%
three cte centers which obviously is is
 
00:28:41.750 --> 00:28:41.760 align:start position:0%
better than just pinkerton utilizing it
 
00:28:44.070 --> 00:28:44.080 align:start position:0%
but we want to bump it up to you know
 
00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:46.240 align:start position:0%
all the centers using it theoretically
 
00:28:47.430 --> 00:28:47.440 align:start position:0%
because even if they you know each
 
00:28:50.470 --> 00:28:50.480 align:start position:0%
center had one large
 
00:28:52.389 --> 00:28:52.399 align:start position:0%
donation that would get us closer to
 
00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:56.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:01.190 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.350 align:start position:0%
 
well

00:29:03.350 --> 00:29:03.360 align:start position:0%
well
 
00:29:04.789 --> 00:29:04.799 align:start position:0%
it just seems like
 
00:29:10.470 --> 00:29:10.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:12.950 --> 00:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
i mean it's a good program
 
00:29:16.070 --> 00:29:16.080 align:start position:0%
um i guess the only thing i'd i'd ask is
 
00:29:17.350 --> 00:29:17.360 align:start position:0%
is there
 
00:29:20.310 --> 00:29:20.320 align:start position:0%
any way we can find out
 
00:29:22.950 --> 00:29:22.960 align:start position:0%
how many com companies are
 
00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:24.549 align:start position:0%
how many com companies are
donating

00:29:24.549 --> 00:29:24.559 align:start position:0%
donating
 
00:29:24.559 --> 00:29:25.590 align:start position:0%
donating
time

00:29:25.590 --> 00:29:25.600 align:start position:0%
time
 
00:29:25.600 --> 00:29:26.630 align:start position:0%
time
equipment

00:29:26.630 --> 00:29:26.640 align:start position:0%
equipment
 
00:29:29.269 --> 00:29:29.279 align:start position:0%
without asking for a tax credit
 
00:29:31.750 --> 00:29:31.760 align:start position:0%
is that something we can ask the 29
 
00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:33.679 align:start position:0%
centers to see if they have any sense of
 
00:29:35.669 --> 00:29:35.679 align:start position:0%
that yeah i can certainly look into it
 
00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:37.360 align:start position:0%
and see what information i can get back
 
00:29:39.269 --> 00:29:39.279 align:start position:0%
right yeah
 
00:29:41.029 --> 00:29:41.039 align:start position:0%
because that's a piece if it's like big
 
00:29:42.470 --> 00:29:42.480 align:start position:0%
percentage that are doing that we you
 
00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:43.350 align:start position:0%
percentage that are doing that we you
know

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:43.360 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:29:45.190 --> 00:29:45.200 align:start position:0%
say well
 
00:29:46.950 --> 00:29:46.960 align:start position:0%
because right now i mean
 
00:29:49.029 --> 00:29:49.039 align:start position:0%
time's out what did we say your timeout
 
00:29:51.590 --> 00:29:51.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:29:52.870 --> 00:29:52.880 align:start position:0%
what i know
 
00:29:55.269 --> 00:29:55.279 align:start position:0%
26. yeah
 
00:29:56.950 --> 00:29:56.960 align:start position:0%
yeah so
 
00:29:59.990 --> 00:30:00.000 align:start position:0%
we're approaching 20 well 22. so yeah we
 
00:30:01.269 --> 00:30:01.279 align:start position:0%
got we got to be careful with you guys
 
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:03.200 align:start position:0%
we got a ways to go yeah
 
00:30:06.389 --> 00:30:06.399 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:09.830 --> 00:30:09.840 align:start position:0%
we're missing senator gaida
 
00:30:11.990 --> 00:30:12.000 align:start position:0%
today and uh
 
00:30:13.750 --> 00:30:13.760 align:start position:0%
we'll have a meeting in the fall is that
 
00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:16.240 align:start position:0%
right that's what we're gonna do and um
 
00:30:17.909 --> 00:30:17.919 align:start position:0%
we'll have a
 
00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:19.360 align:start position:0%
report from
 
00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:20.310 align:start position:0%
report from
you

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:20.320 align:start position:0%
you
 
00:30:22.389 --> 00:30:22.399 align:start position:0%
by the end of well
 
00:30:24.070 --> 00:30:24.080 align:start position:0%
in july
 
00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.350 align:start position:0%
in july
um

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:25.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:27.110 --> 00:30:27.120 align:start position:0%
so we'll have
 
00:30:29.909 --> 00:30:29.919 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:29.919 --> 00:30:30.789 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:30:30.789 --> 00:30:30.799 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:30:32.789 --> 00:30:32.799 align:start position:0%
and um
 
00:30:35.510 --> 00:30:35.520 align:start position:0%
you know if uh if you have additional
 
00:30:39.350 --> 00:30:39.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:30:42.070 --> 00:30:42.080 align:start position:0%
that you could convey to us that
 
00:30:44.630 --> 00:30:44.640 align:start position:0%
sort of addresses these this question of
 
00:30:47.190 --> 00:30:47.200 align:start position:0%
a parent under participation
 
00:30:48.710 --> 00:30:48.720 align:start position:0%
in the program
 
00:30:51.029 --> 00:30:51.039 align:start position:0%
that would be really helpful sure
 
00:30:51.039 --> 00:30:52.149 align:start position:0%
that would be really helpful sure
um

00:30:52.149 --> 00:30:52.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:53.520 align:start position:0%
and i don't know what else you might
 
00:30:56.149 --> 00:30:56.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:02.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:04.870 align:start position:0%
 
right

00:31:04.870 --> 00:31:04.880 align:start position:0%
right
 
00:31:06.630 --> 00:31:06.640 align:start position:0%
right so in that meeting we'll probably
 
00:31:08.789 --> 00:31:08.799 align:start position:0%
have the two that could make that clear
 
00:31:10.149 --> 00:31:10.159 align:start position:0%
about the two programs we didn't hear
 
00:31:11.669 --> 00:31:11.679 align:start position:0%
about today
 
00:31:14.310 --> 00:31:14.320 align:start position:0%
uh and then at that point we'd probably
 
00:31:15.509 --> 00:31:15.519 align:start position:0%
have we're talking about our
 
00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:16.789 align:start position:0%
have we're talking about our
recommendations

00:31:16.789 --> 00:31:16.799 align:start position:0%
recommendations
 
00:31:19.830 --> 00:31:19.840 align:start position:0%
right at that point so yeah
 
00:31:22.389 --> 00:31:22.399 align:start position:0%
so okay
 
00:31:24.710 --> 00:31:24.720 align:start position:0%
somebody else yeah no i appreciate your
 
00:31:27.590 --> 00:31:27.600 align:start position:0%
time thank you so yeah and then when you
 
00:31:29.909 --> 00:31:29.919 align:start position:0%
sent those reports on it should go to i
 
00:31:31.750 --> 00:31:31.760 align:start position:0%
would imagine it it would go to norm
 
00:31:31.760 --> 00:31:33.190 align:start position:0%
would imagine it it would go to norm
major

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:33.200 align:start position:0%
major
 
00:31:34.630 --> 00:31:34.640 align:start position:0%
from house
 
00:31:35.909 --> 00:31:35.919 align:start position:0%
and it would go to guider actually
 
00:31:37.830 --> 00:31:37.840 align:start position:0%
because he's chair of his chair of ways
 
00:31:40.070 --> 00:31:40.080 align:start position:0%

00:32:15.990 --> 00:32:16.000 align:start position:0%

00:32:18.950 --> 00:32:18.960 align:start position:0%
talk about the tax credits from the this
 
00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:21.120 align:start position:0%

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:22.310 align:start position:0%
program just want to highlight
that

00:32:22.310 --> 00:32:22.320 align:start position:0%
that
 
00:32:24.710 --> 00:32:24.720 align:start position:0%
for the business profits tax purposes
 
00:32:27.669 --> 00:32:27.679 align:start position:0%

00:32:27.679 --> 00:32:28.470 align:start position:0%
the credits that's allowed
for

00:32:28.470 --> 00:32:28.480 align:start position:0%

00:32:31.909 --> 00:32:31.919 align:start position:0%
uh to be claimed shall not exceed 25 of
 
00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:33.600 align:start position:0%
the tax due
 
00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:35.440 align:start position:0%
uh for that particular taxpayer so make
 
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:37.360 align:start position:0%
sure that that's that's aware that
 
00:32:41.029 --> 00:32:41.039 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:45.750 --> 00:32:45.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:47.830 --> 00:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
trouble with that
 
00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:48.950 align:start position:0%
trouble with that
yeah

00:32:48.950 --> 00:32:48.960 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:51.669 align:start position:0%
yeah
right

00:32:51.669 --> 00:32:51.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:32:53.430 --> 00:32:53.440 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a limiting factor i don't
 
00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.070 align:start position:0%
maybe that's a limiting factor i don't
know

00:32:56.070 --> 00:32:56.080 align:start position:0%
know
 
00:32:59.669 --> 00:32:59.679 align:start position:0%
exceed 20 percent of tax due okay right
 
00:32:59.679 --> 00:33:00.710 align:start position:0%
exceed 20 percent of tax due okay right
25

00:33:00.710 --> 00:33:00.720 align:start position:0%
25
 
00:33:04.789 --> 00:33:04.799 align:start position:0%
25 of the tax dude 25 tax too
 
00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:09.110 align:start position:0%
25 of the tax dude 25 tax too
okay

00:33:09.110 --> 00:33:09.120 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:10.070 align:start position:0%
 
no

00:33:10.070 --> 00:33:10.080 align:start position:0%
no
 
00:33:11.350 --> 00:33:11.360 align:start position:0%
we can work backwards to kind of get a
 
00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240 align:start position:0%
sense of revenue you know
 
00:33:16.789 --> 00:33:16.799 align:start position:0%
does that seem odorous i don't think so
 
00:33:18.389 --> 00:33:18.399 align:start position:0%
what do you think
 
00:33:21.110 --> 00:33:21.120 align:start position:0%
i'm i'm not sure because um this this
 
00:33:23.029 --> 00:33:23.039 align:start position:0%
was in the bill when it was first
 
00:33:25.430 --> 00:33:25.440 align:start position:0%
introduced so i'm sure uh during then
 
00:33:26.789 --> 00:33:26.799 align:start position:0%
probably um
 
00:33:30.389 --> 00:33:30.399 align:start position:0%
analysis was performed and that was the
 
00:33:35.029 --> 00:33:35.039 align:start position:0%
the number that was decided okay yeah
 
00:33:41.190 --> 00:33:41.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.070 --> 00:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
yes it's on the business profits tax rsa
 
00:33:46.870 --> 00:33:46.880 align:start position:0%
so it's on the chapter 77-a
 
00:34:01.190 --> 00:34:01.200 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:03.830 align:start position:0%
 
um

00:34:03.830 --> 00:34:03.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:04.870 --> 00:34:04.880 align:start position:0%
yeah and then
 
00:34:06.870 --> 00:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
in the fall we're gonna
 
00:34:10.149 --> 00:34:10.159 align:start position:0%
we're gonna hear about the um
 
00:34:13.349 --> 00:34:13.359 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:16.230 --> 00:34:16.240 align:start position:0%
the coast county job creation tax credit
 
00:34:18.230 --> 00:34:18.240 align:start position:0%
and the
 
00:34:20.470 --> 00:34:20.480 align:start position:0%

00:34:21.669 --> 00:34:21.679 align:start position:0%

00:34:23.430 --> 00:34:23.440 align:start position:0%
we didn't
 
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.750 align:start position:0%
we didn't
so

00:34:25.750 --> 00:34:25.760 align:start position:0%
 
00:34:27.829 --> 00:34:27.839 align:start position:0%
all right
 
00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:28.629 align:start position:0%
all right

and
 
00:34:29.589 --> 00:34:29.599 align:start position:0%

00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:16.710 align:start position:0%
and they were they were a little
confused

00:35:16.710 --> 00:35:16.720 align:start position:0%
confused
 
00:35:19.510 --> 00:35:19.520 align:start position:0%
because the senators
 
00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:20.790 align:start position:0%
because the senators

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:24.480 align:start position:0%
the senators the senators um

that were there
 
00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:27.520 align:start position:0%

00:35:29.030 --> 00:35:29.040 align:start position:0%
skyr wasn't there
 
00:35:30.790 --> 00:35:30.800 align:start position:0%

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960 align:start position:0%
like i don't know did grab blue or
 
00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.400 align:start position:0%
whatever or
 
00:35:35.829 --> 00:35:35.839 align:start position:0%

the committee conference
 
00:35:39.510 --> 00:35:39.520 align:start position:0%
and then when i got in there i could see
 
00:35:41.030 --> 00:35:41.040 align:start position:0%
that there was some confusion so i
 
00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:42.720 align:start position:0%
raised my hand and they let me speak and
 
00:35:44.310 --> 00:35:44.320 align:start position:0%
then after that it kind of broke the log
 
00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:45.750 align:start position:0%
then after that it kind of broke the log
jam

00:35:45.750 --> 00:35:45.760 align:start position:0%
jam
 
00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:46.550 align:start position:0%
jam
but

00:35:46.550 --> 00:35:46.560 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:35:48.550 --> 00:35:48.560 align:start position:0%
yeah so million dollars
 
00:35:48.560 --> 00:35:49.430 align:start position:0%
yeah so million dollars
um

00:35:49.430 --> 00:35:49.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:35:51.430 --> 00:35:51.440 align:start position:0%
and it'll be on the floor but i i don't
 
00:35:56.870 --> 00:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:35:58.470 --> 00:35:58.480 align:start position:0%
then i just so you know i dropped a note
 
00:36:00.710 --> 00:36:00.720 align:start position:0%
to um
 
00:36:05.270 --> 00:36:05.280 align:start position:0%
to tui from the army and to key wallace
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
to tell him that
 
00:36:08.630 --> 00:36:08.640 align:start position:0%
assuming everything goes well on
 
00:36:10.470 --> 00:36:10.480 align:start position:0%
thursday there should be a million
 
00:36:13.109 --> 00:36:13.119 align:start position:0%
dollars there uh and if the government
 
00:36:15.030 --> 00:36:15.040 align:start position:0%
signs i'm sure to sign it but
 
00:36:17.190 --> 00:36:17.200 align:start position:0%
um just so they know that we we did act
 
00:36:18.790 --> 00:36:18.800 align:start position:0%
we did follow up
 
00:36:21.270 --> 00:36:21.280 align:start position:0%
you know so just so you know
 
00:36:24.150 --> 00:36:24.160 align:start position:0%
all right so i think we are adjourned
 
00:36:27.190 --> 00:36:27.200 align:start position:0%
right thanks for coming in both of you
 
00:36:28.630 --> 00:36:28.640 align:start position:0%
so that one of these journeys did for
 
00:36:32.230 --> 00:36:32.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.230 --> 00:36:40.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:42.069 --> 00:36:42.079 align:start position:0%
you got to figure it out
 
00:36:45.510 --> 00:36:45.520 align:start position:0%
a lot of businesses that are helping out
 
00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:48.640 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:51.990 --> 00:36:52.000 align:start position:0%
they see it as beneficial
 
00:36:54.230 --> 00:36:54.240 align:start position:0%
in some respects in many respects i'm
 
00:36:57.670 --> 00:36:57.680 align:start position:0%
sure to their businesses and to their
 
00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:58.870 align:start position:0%
sure to their businesses and to their
uh

00:36:58.870 --> 00:36:58.880 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:37:02.069 --> 00:37:02.079 align:start position:0%
to their good will right
 
00:37:03.510 --> 00:37:03.520 align:start position:0%
so to me where the disconnect was when
 
00:37:06.230 --> 00:37:06.240 align:start position:0%
they said there were 9 500 students so
 
00:37:06.240 --> 00:37:07.030 align:start position:0%
they said there were 9 500 students so
wow

00:37:07.030 --> 00:37:07.040 align:start position:0%
wow
 
00:37:08.150 --> 00:37:08.160 align:start position:0%
i think there would be a lot more
 
00:37:10.870 --> 00:37:10.880 align:start position:0%
businesses that would be you know
 
00:37:10.880 --> 00:37:11.829 align:start position:0%
businesses that would be you know
but

00:37:11.829 --> 00:37:11.839 align:start position:0%
but
 
00:37:13.670 --> 00:37:13.680 align:start position:0%
so anyway
 
00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.390 align:start position:0%
so anyway
so

00:37:14.390 --> 00:37:14.400 align:start position:0%
so
 
00:37:15.750 --> 00:37:15.760 align:start position:0%
yeah and that was always good to hear
 
00:37:17.349 --> 00:37:17.359 align:start position:0%
from you let's just see how these things
 
00:37:18.310 --> 00:37:18.320 align:start position:0%
are doing
 
00:37:19.990 --> 00:37:20.000 align:start position:0%
and i didn't realize it was 19 it's only
 
00:37:25.510 --> 00:37:25.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:27.829 --> 00:37:27.839 align:start position:0%
yeah yeah that's a good point
 
00:37:29.270 --> 00:37:29.280 align:start position:0%
yeah those were right those were covered
 
00:37:30.950 --> 00:37:30.960 align:start position:0%
years too that we were looking at
 
00:37:32.310 --> 00:37:32.320 align:start position:0%
so maybe the next report will be a
 
00:37:34.150 --> 00:37:34.160 align:start position:0%
little better but
 
00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:35.030 align:start position:0%
little better but
see

00:37:35.030 --> 00:37:35.040 align:start position:0%
