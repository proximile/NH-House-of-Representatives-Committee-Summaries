00:08:47.519 --> 00:08:49.269 align:start position:0%
 
there<00:08:47.680><c> was</c><00:08:47.839><c> a</c><00:08:47.920><c> slight</c><00:08:48.240><c> dip</c><00:08:48.640><c> uh</c><00:08:48.800><c> one</c><00:08:48.959><c> thing</c><00:08:49.120><c> we</c>

00:08:49.269 --> 00:08:49.279 align:start position:0%
there was a slight dip uh one thing we
 

00:08:49.279 --> 00:08:50.949 align:start position:0%
there was a slight dip uh one thing we
do<00:08:49.519><c> see</c><00:08:49.760><c> is</c><00:08:49.839><c> that</c><00:08:50.000><c> we're</c><00:08:50.320><c> pretty</c><00:08:50.560><c> steady</c><00:08:50.880><c> with</c>

00:08:50.949 --> 00:08:50.959 align:start position:0%
do see is that we're pretty steady with
 

00:08:50.959 --> 00:08:53.990 align:start position:0%
do see is that we're pretty steady with
about<00:08:51.320><c> 9500</c><00:08:52.399><c> students</c><00:08:52.720><c> annually</c><00:08:53.600><c> that</c><00:08:53.760><c> are</c>

um<00:08:56.160><c> there</c><00:08:56.560><c> have</c><00:08:56.720><c> been</c>

00:08:57.509 --> 00:08:57.519 align:start position:0%
um there have been
 

00:08:57.519 --> 00:09:00.230 align:start position:0%
um there have been

00:09:00.230 --> 00:09:00.240 align:start position:0%
across the state some some slight uh
 

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:02.470 align:start position:0%
across the state some some slight uh

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:02.480 align:start position:0%

00:09:04.070 --> 00:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
enrollments are pretty robust for the
 

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.829 align:start position:0%
enrollments are pretty robust for the
upcoming<00:09:04.399><c> year</c><00:09:04.560><c> so</c><00:09:04.640><c> it'll</c><00:09:04.800><c> probably</c><00:09:05.120><c> be</c><00:09:05.279><c> about</c>

00:09:05.829 --> 00:09:05.839 align:start position:0%
upcoming year so it'll probably be about
 

00:09:05.839 --> 00:09:08.870 align:start position:0%
upcoming year so it'll probably be about
what<00:09:06.000><c> we've</c><00:09:06.240><c> seen</c><00:09:06.480><c> that</c><00:09:06.720><c> at</c><00:09:06.880><c> 9</c><00:09:07.200><c> 500.</c>

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:08.880 align:start position:0%
what we've seen that at 9 500.
 

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:10.630 align:start position:0%
what we've seen that at 9 500.
one<00:09:09.040><c> thing</c><00:09:09.200><c> we</c><00:09:09.279><c> do</c><00:09:09.440><c> see</c><00:09:09.680><c> is</c><00:09:09.760><c> that</c><00:09:10.000><c> although</c><00:09:10.399><c> our</c>

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:10.640 align:start position:0%
one thing we do see is that although our
 

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:12.389 align:start position:0%
one thing we do see is that although our
high<00:09:10.880><c> school</c><00:09:11.279><c> enrollments</c><00:09:11.760><c> continue</c><00:09:12.080><c> to</c><00:09:12.240><c> tick</c>

00:09:12.389 --> 00:09:12.399 align:start position:0%
high school enrollments continue to tick
 

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:14.389 align:start position:0%
high school enrollments continue to tick
downward<00:09:12.800><c> a</c><00:09:12.880><c> little</c><00:09:13.120><c> bit</c><00:09:13.360><c> across</c><00:09:13.680><c> the</c><00:09:13.839><c> state</c>

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399 align:start position:0%
downward a little bit across the state
 

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:18.470 align:start position:0%
downward a little bit across the state
ct<00:09:14.800><c> enrollments</c><00:09:15.440><c> remain</c><00:09:15.760><c> steady</c>

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.269 align:start position:0%
 
so

00:09:19.269 --> 00:09:19.279 align:start position:0%
so
 

00:09:19.279 --> 00:09:20.310 align:start position:0%
so
this

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:20.320 align:start position:0%
this
 

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.790 align:start position:0%
this
let's<00:09:20.560><c> clarify</c><00:09:20.959><c> that</c><00:09:21.279><c> then</c><00:09:21.519><c> the</c><00:09:21.279><c> the</c>

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:22.800 align:start position:0%
let's clarify that then the the
 

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.790 align:start position:0%
let's clarify that then the the
there's<00:09:23.040><c> 9</c><00:09:23.279><c> 500</c><00:09:23.760><c> students</c><00:09:24.080><c> that</c><00:09:24.240><c> are</c><00:09:24.399><c> active</c>

00:09:24.790 --> 00:09:24.800 align:start position:0%
there's 9 500 students that are active
 

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.630 align:start position:0%

and so the question here is uh
the<00:20:02.720><c> participation</c><00:20:03.440><c> rate</c><00:20:03.679><c> has</c><00:20:03.760><c> been</c><00:20:04.000><c> pretty</c>

it is
 

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:29.190 align:start position:0%
it is
i<00:20:27.440><c> think</c><00:20:27.600><c> that</c><00:20:27.760><c> is</c><00:20:27.919><c> likely</c><00:20:28.320><c> happening</c><00:20:28.880><c> i</c><00:20:29.039><c> will</c>

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:29.200 align:start position:0%
i think that is likely happening i will
 

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.470 align:start position:0%
i think that is likely happening i will
say<00:20:29.360><c> though</c><00:20:29.520><c> that</c><00:20:29.679><c> the</c><00:20:29.840><c> amount</c><00:20:30.000><c> of</c><00:20:30.080><c> paperwork</c>

00:20:30.470 --> 00:20:30.480 align:start position:0%
say though that the amount of paperwork
 

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:32.390 align:start position:0%
say though that the amount of paperwork
is<00:20:30.559><c> not</c><00:20:30.799><c> onerous</c><00:20:31.600><c> it's</c><00:20:31.679><c> not</c><00:20:31.919><c> an</c><00:20:32.080><c> additional</c>

00:20:32.390 --> 00:20:32.400 align:start position:0%
is not onerous it's not an additional
 

00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.549 align:start position:0%
is not onerous it's not an additional
burden<00:20:32.720><c> on</c><00:20:32.880><c> the</c><00:20:33.760><c> very</c><00:20:34.000><c> straightforward</c>

00:20:34.549 --> 00:20:34.559 align:start position:0%
burden on the very straightforward
 

00:20:34.559 --> 00:20:36.470 align:start position:0%
burden on the very straightforward
process<00:20:35.280><c> so</c><00:20:35.440><c> i</c><00:20:35.520><c> don't</c><00:20:35.760><c> i</c><00:20:35.840><c> don't</c><00:20:36.080><c> think</c><00:20:36.240><c> that's</c>

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:36.480 align:start position:0%
process so i don't i don't think that's
 

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:37.990 align:start position:0%
process so i don't i don't think that's
a<00:20:36.559><c> barrier</c><00:20:36.960><c> to</c><00:20:37.039><c> participation</c><00:20:37.679><c> i</c><00:20:37.760><c> really</c>

00:20:37.990 --> 00:20:38.000 align:start position:0%
a barrier to participation i really
 

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.310 align:start position:0%
a barrier to participation i really
think<00:20:38.240><c> probably</c><00:20:38.880><c> it's</c><00:20:39.200><c> really</c><00:20:39.440><c> just</c>

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:40.320 align:start position:0%
think probably it's really just
 

00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.950 align:start position:0%
think probably it's really just
um<00:20:40.640><c> not</c><00:20:40.960><c> front</c><00:20:41.120><c> of</c><00:20:41.200><c> mind</c><00:20:41.679><c> for</c><00:20:41.840><c> a</c><00:20:41.919><c> lot</c><00:20:42.080><c> of</c><00:20:42.320><c> the</c>

00:20:42.950 --> 00:20:42.960 align:start position:0%
um not front of mind for a lot of the
 

00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:45.029 align:start position:0%
um not front of mind for a lot of the
folks<00:20:43.200><c> that</c><00:20:43.360><c> maybe</c><00:20:43.679><c> are</c><00:20:43.840><c> giving</c><00:20:44.080><c> gifts</c>

00:20:45.029 --> 00:20:45.039 align:start position:0%
folks that maybe are giving gifts
 

00:20:45.039 --> 00:20:46.470 align:start position:0%
folks that maybe are giving gifts
so<00:20:45.200><c> again</c><00:20:45.440><c> it</c><00:20:45.520><c> just</c><00:20:45.760><c> goes</c><00:20:45.919><c> back</c><00:20:46.159><c> to</c><00:20:46.320><c> our</c>

would cut it you know and uh when they
graduated

00:22:33.510 --> 00:22:33.520 align:start position:0%
graduated
 

00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.350 align:start position:0%

so<00:22:33.679><c> it's</c><00:22:34.320><c> so</c><00:22:34.480><c> they</c><00:22:34.640><c> just</c><00:22:34.799><c> probably</c><00:22:35.039><c> just</c><00:22:35.200><c> find</c>

00:22:35.350 --> 00:22:35.360 align:start position:0%
so it's so they just probably just find
 

00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:37.590 align:start position:0%
so it's so they just probably just find
