good morning everyone in Feud please
 
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.080 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:22.400 align:start position:0%
Allegiance I pledge allegiance to the
 
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:25.240 align:start position:0%
flag of the United States of America and
 
00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 align:start position:0%
to the Republic for which it stands one
 
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 align:start position:0%
nation under God IND
 
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:40.360 align:start position:0%
you with that I open the public hearing
 
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 56 and invite the sponsor
 
00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:49.239 align:start position:0%
 
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman and members
 
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:55.480 align:start position:0%
is representative David Muse and I
 
00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 align:start position:0%
represent the city of Portsmouth and the
 
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
towns of Newington and Newcastle
 
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
I come before you today to introduce a
 
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 align:start position:0%
common sense Public Safety bill that
 
00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 align:start position:0%
would do two things first hp56 would
 
00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 align:start position:0%
Implement a universal firearms
 
00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 align:start position:0%
background check process in our state
 
00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 align:start position:0%
and secondly it would establish a
 
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 align:start position:0%
minimum 72-hour waiting
 
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 align:start position:0%
period before a transfer can take place
 
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 align:start position:0%
this bill has two main objectives the
 
00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 align:start position:0%
first is to reduce the risk of firearms
 
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 align:start position:0%
falling into the hands of felons
 
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
protective order violators domestic
 
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 align:start position:0%
abusers and people whose severe mental
 
00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 align:start position:0%
illness has made them federally
 
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 align:start position:0%
ineligible to buy
 
00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 align:start position:0%
firearms the second is to help reduce
 
00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 align:start position:0%
gun homicides and suicides in our state
 
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 align:start position:0%
by creating a 72-hour buffer of time
 
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
that can help people who are in a crisis
 
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 align:start position:0%
or considering
 
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 align:start position:0%
suicide currently in New Hampshire a
 
00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 align:start position:0%
firearms background check is only
 
00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:56.439 align:start position:0%
required when a firearm purchase is made
 
00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 align:start position:0%
from a federally licensed Firearms
 
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 align:start position:0%
dealer while a felony in New Hampshire
 
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 align:start position:0%
to sell or transfer a firearm to a
 
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:05.560 align:start position:0%
convicted felon enforcing this
 
00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 align:start position:0%
prohibition can be a challenge that's
 
00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 align:start position:0%
because of a critical loophole in our
 
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 align:start position:0%
state we don't require background checks
 
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 align:start position:0%
for Private Sales that don't involve a
 
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.589 align:start position:0%
for Private Sales that don't involve a
licens

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 align:start position:0%
licens
 
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 align:start position:0%
dealer this loophole creates a dangerous
 
00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 align:start position:0%
Gap in our law it not only makes it
 
00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 align:start position:0%
easier for a convicted felon to obtain a
 
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.280 align:start position:0%
firearm but also for domestic abusers
 
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 align:start position:0%
and other people our laws have
 
00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 align:start position:0%
determined POS a public safety risk high
 
00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 align:start position:0%
enough to prevent them from owning a
 
00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 align:start position:0%
firearm unlike past attempts to pass a
 
00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 align:start position:0%
bill like this the bill before you today
 
00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 align:start position:0%
does not try to parse the difference
 
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 align:start position:0%
between a commercial sale and a private
 
00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 align:start position:0%
sale under this proposed legislation any
 
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 align:start position:0%
transfer of ownership of a firearm where
 
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 align:start position:0%
neither party is a licensed Firearms
 
00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 align:start position:0%
dealer will require a background check
 
00:02:57.869 --> 00:02:57.879 align:start position:0%
the logic is pretty simple if you want
 
00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 align:start position:0%
to buy a gun in New Hampshire you need
 
00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 align:start position:0%
to get a background check in New
 
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire but for most sensible rules
 
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 align:start position:0%
there are always sensible exceptions
 
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 align:start position:0%
you'll find them in this bill starting
 
00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 align:start position:0%
on page three line n you'll see certain
 
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 align:start position:0%
types of transfers have been carved out
 
00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:20.159 align:start position:0%
these include among other things gifts
 
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 align:start position:0%
and inheritances between immediate
 
00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 align:start position:0%
family members and temporary transfers
 
00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 align:start position:0%
between hunters and Target
 
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 align:start position:0%
Shooters under the bill transfer between
 
00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 align:start position:0%
private parties will be facilitated by
 
00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 align:start position:0%
federally licensed firearms dealers at
 
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 align:start position:0%
their place of business the role of the
 
00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 align:start position:0%
dealer will be to initiate the
 
00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 align:start position:0%
background check process to notify the
 
00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 align:start position:0%
parties of the result and if the
 
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 align:start position:0%
background check clears to complete the
 
00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 align:start position:0%
transfer between the two parties you'll
 
00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 align:start position:0%
find the process outlined starting on
 
00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
page two line
 
00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:56.079 align:start position:0%
13 another key part of this bill is the
 
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:58.480 align:start position:0%
minimum 72-hour waiting period between
 
00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 align:start position:0%
the time of background check is
 
00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 align:start position:0%
initiated and the transfer of the
 
00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:05.120 align:start position:0%
firearm to the new owner currently there
 
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 align:start position:0%
is no waiting period and a weapon can be
 
00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 align:start position:0%
transferred as soon as the background
 
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 align:start position:0%
check clears under this bill the waiting
 
00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:14.879 align:start position:0%
period would start immediately after the
 
00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 align:start position:0%
initiation of the background check by a
 
00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 align:start position:0%
licensed Firearms dealer if the
 
00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 align:start position:0%
background check clears the waiting
 
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 align:start position:0%
period would expire 72 hours after the
 
00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 align:start position:0%
process was initiated by the dealer to
 
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 align:start position:0%
be clear no transfer could take place
 
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 align:start position:0%
until the background check clears even
 
00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 align:start position:0%
if it takes more than 72
 
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 align:start position:0%
hours why at a waiting period because
 
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 align:start position:0%
for people in crisis a waiting period
 
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 align:start position:0%
can mean the difference between life and
 
00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 align:start position:0%
death as you'll hear a bit later suicide
 
00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 align:start position:0%
attempts are often impulsive singular
 
00:04:50.029 --> 00:04:50.039 align:start position:0%
tragedies that involve very little
 
00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 align:start position:0%
planning Studies have also shown that
 
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 align:start position:0%
some of the factors that incite violence
 
00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 align:start position:0%
against others such as anger and rage
 
00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 align:start position:0%
can also be very short-lived and can
 
00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 align:start position:0%
dissipate if given
 
00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 align:start position:0%
time waiting periods provide a cooling
 
00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 align:start position:0%
off period for people who might harm
 
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:07.720 align:start position:0%
themselves or others Universal
 
00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:09.600 align:start position:0%
background checks help reduce the risk
 
00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 align:start position:0%
of firearms from falling into the hands
 
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.120 align:start position:0%
of people that are laws for very good
 
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 align:start position:0%
reason prohibit from purchasing prohibit
 
00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 align:start position:0%
from purchasing or possessing
 
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000 align:start position:0%
firearms for 99% of the population these
 
00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 align:start position:0%
changes will basically be a small
 
00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:27.800 align:start position:0%
inconvenience but for more than a few of
 
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 align:start position:0%
our citizens these changes could be
 
00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 align:start position:0%
Lifesavers I ask the committee to
 
00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 align:start position:0%
recommend hp56 ought to pass and I'm
 
00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions you may have
 
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:39.880 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:05:42.469 --> 00:05:42.479 align:start position:0%
representative um represent
 
00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:46.160 align:start position:0%
PR I didn't see a carve out for uh let's
 
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:49.520 align:start position:0%
say uh a woman who just filed a
 
00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:51.240 align:start position:0%
restraining order because someone
 
00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:54.039 align:start position:0%
threatened her life I didn't see that in
 
00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:56.639 align:start position:0%
there that's because it is not in
 
00:05:59.230 --> 00:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
there and one of the reasons it it's not
 
00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:01.840 align:start position:0%
in there we we got feedback uh from
 
00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 align:start position:0%
different organ from from several
 
00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:06.919 align:start position:0%
different organizations that um that
 
00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 align:start position:0%
particular uh type of provision uh is is
 
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 align:start position:0%
problematic uh many times the uh the
 
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
woman won't necessarily have had any
 
00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 align:start position:0%
training uh in the use of the firearm
 
00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 align:start position:0%
it's also very possible for somebody
 
00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 align:start position:0%
who's not familiar with how to handle a
 
00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 align:start position:0%
gun or how to handle uh somebody in a
 
00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:26.840 align:start position:0%
situation like that that the gun can be
 
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:29.280 align:start position:0%
taken away from her and used against her
 
00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is it's a two-edged
 
00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:35.680 align:start position:0%
sword any further questions
 
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:37.309 align:start position:0%
sword any further questions
representative

00:06:37.309 --> 00:06:37.319 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 align:start position:0%
Sher uh could you tell me what the
 
00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:42.599 align:start position:0%
percentage of suicides or gun
 
00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 align:start position:0%
suicides the percentage of gun suicides
 
00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 align:start position:0%
percentage of suicides that are suicide
 
00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 align:start position:0%
by gun by gun not off the top of my head
 
00:06:55.189 --> 00:06:55.199 align:start position:0%
 
00:06:57.990 --> 00:06:58.000 align:start position:0%
you any further
 
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for
 
00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:07.560 align:start position:0%
us um at this point I want to let
 
00:07:10.309 --> 00:07:10.319 align:start position:0%
everyone know that we have um we have
 
00:07:12.029 --> 00:07:12.039 align:start position:0%
well over a dozen people who are going
 
00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 align:start position:0%
to testify today so I'm going to limit
 
00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 align:start position:0%
testimony three minutes each please the
 
00:07:19.029 --> 00:07:19.039 align:start position:0%
time will be kept by the clerk and we'll
 
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 align:start position:0%
let you know when you're about 15
 
00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:22.599 align:start position:0%
seconds out so please try to condense
 
00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:24.560 align:start position:0%
your testimony and not repeat what other
 
00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 align:start position:0%
people have said if you have a Salient
 
00:07:28.589 --> 00:07:28.599 align:start position:0%
Point you'd like to get across yourself
 
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.560 align:start position:0%
with that I recommend I recognize
 
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:33.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:48.869 --> 00:07:48.879 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:52.110 --> 00:07:52.120 align:start position:0%
here yes good morning to the committee
 
00:07:53.629 --> 00:07:53.639 align:start position:0%
my name is Sue Newman I'm a
 
00:07:58.149 --> 00:07:58.159 align:start position:0%
representative from NASA ward two um I'm
 
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:00.960 align:start position:0%
my remarks will be very very brief
 
00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:02.919 align:start position:0%
previous representative covered
 
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:07.680 align:start position:0%
everything and did it expertly as he
 
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:10.120 align:start position:0%
always does I just want to say a couple
 
00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:12.840 align:start position:0%
of words common sense um I've heard a
 
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:14.800 align:start position:0%
lot about common sense over this past
 
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:17.440 align:start position:0%
year people running for office our our
 
00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:20.199 align:start position:0%
president now has said he is supporting
 
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:23.800 align:start position:0%
a revolution of Common Sense and to me
 
00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:27.120 align:start position:0%
background checks has and will remain a
 
00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.319 align:start position:0%
common sense issue years years ago when
 
00:08:33.269 --> 00:08:33.279 align:start position:0%
I was walking around many parts of our
 
00:08:36.990 --> 00:08:37.000 align:start position:0%
ward in NASA I asked gun owners and
 
00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:39.919 align:start position:0%
non-gun owners alike did they support
 
00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:43.200 align:start position:0%
background checks many were horrified
 
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:45.640 align:start position:0%
that background checks weren't required
 
00:08:47.829 --> 00:08:47.839 align:start position:0%
already but they weren't but people
 
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:51.360 align:start position:0%
supported it um driving up here today I
 
00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:53.600 align:start position:0%
couldn't help but noticing bid trucks on
 
00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:56.080 align:start position:0%
the road small trucks small cars large
 
00:08:58.389 --> 00:08:58.399 align:start position:0%
cars whatever the thing in common that
 
00:09:00.829 --> 00:09:00.839 align:start position:0%
we have we've all got a license to drive
 
00:09:03.829 --> 00:09:03.839 align:start position:0%
or at least we should so I'm just I'm
 
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:06.160 align:start position:0%
going to go I'm going to end with common
 
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.160 align:start position:0%
sense that if you people the committee
 
00:09:12.710 --> 00:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
and hopefully the entire house is
 
00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:16.360 align:start position:0%
supportive and grasps the concept of
 
00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:19.160 align:start position:0%
common sense I would hope background
 
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.160 align:start position:0%
checks falls into that as a common sense
 
00:09:25.150 --> 00:09:25.160 align:start position:0%
measure to prevent and help prevent gun
 
00:09:27.790 --> 00:09:27.800 align:start position:0%
violence thank you thank you
 
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:32.069 align:start position:0%

00:09:52.710 --> 00:09:52.720 align:start position:0%
opposition of
 
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.160 align:start position:0%
hp56 uh this bill injects federal
 
00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:56.920 align:start position:0%
government into what should be a simple
 
00:09:59.509 --> 00:09:59.519 align:start position:0%
person-to-person transfer of property
 
00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:01.360 align:start position:0%
it's already a federal crime to transfer
 
00:10:03.790 --> 00:10:03.800 align:start position:0%
to a prohibited person and criminals
 
00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:06.240 align:start position:0%
don't obey this law this puts
 
00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:07.720 align:start position:0%
unnecessary hurdles in the way of a
 
00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.990 align:start position:0%
unnecessary hurdles in the way of a
straightforward

00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.000 align:start position:0%
transaction between law-abiding citizens
 
00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:13.600 align:start position:0%
this is to say nothing of the Fifth
 
00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:16.079 align:start position:0%
Amendment violation that is the ATF Form
 
00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:19.200 align:start position:0%
4473 where admitting to using cannabis
 
00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:21.440 align:start position:0%
even medically prohibits you from
 
00:10:23.790 --> 00:10:23.800 align:start position:0%
receiving a firearm just like every
 
00:10:26.069 --> 00:10:26.079 align:start position:0%
other gun control Bill filed everywhere
 
00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
this will have no impact on violent
 
00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:30.040 align:start position:0%
crime and only punishes those inclined
 
00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:32.200 align:start position:0%
to follow the law already I ask you to
 
00:10:40.509 --> 00:10:40.519 align:start position:0%

please vote ought to pass on HB
 
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.160 align:start position:0%
56 on Wednesday April 12th 2023 a young
 
00:11:07.949 --> 00:11:07.959 align:start position:0%
man posted a video of himself with a
 
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:10.480 align:start position:0%
handgun and the text I'm going to shoot
 
00:11:13.629 --> 00:11:13.639 align:start position:0%
up the school he was in a in his car in
 
00:11:15.790 --> 00:11:15.800 align:start position:0%
front of Portsmouth High School law
 
00:11:18.190 --> 00:11:18.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement later recovered his vehicle
 
00:11:21.750 --> 00:11:21.760 align:start position:0%
in his vehicle an AR-15 rifle a shotgun
 
00:11:25.269 --> 00:11:25.279 align:start position:0%
camouflage body armor a handgun holster
 
00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:27.880 align:start position:0%
a Red Dot site and numerous rounds of
 
00:11:30.990 --> 00:11:31.000 align:start position:0%
ammunition the FBI special agent in
 
00:11:33.389 --> 00:11:33.399 align:start position:0%
charge said the danger posed by Kyle
 
00:11:36.069 --> 00:11:36.079 align:start position:0%
Hendrickson in this case was very real
 
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:38.000 align:start position:0%
he not only threatened to commit a mass
 
00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:40.399 align:start position:0%
shooting at Portsmouth High School he
 
00:11:42.269 --> 00:11:42.279 align:start position:0%
had the means to do it illustrated by
 
00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:45.040 align:start position:0%
the AR-15 rifle shotgun and body armor
 
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:47.760 align:start position:0%
that we recovered inside his vehicle the
 
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:49.480 align:start position:0%
man was charged with a felony and
 
00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959 align:start position:0%
sentenced to 37 months in federal
 
00:11:54.990 --> 00:11:55.000 align:start position:0%
prison my son was a student at PHS at
 
00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:57.519 align:start position:0%
the time in fact you can see his
 
00:12:00.829 --> 00:12:00.839 align:start position:0%
classroom in the video footage um that
 
00:12:03.509 --> 00:12:03.519 align:start position:0%
was posted it was by a stroke of luck or
 
00:12:06.389 --> 00:12:06.399 align:start position:0%
some miraculous moment of Sanity on
 
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:08.360 align:start position:0%
Hendrickson's part that he didn't go
 
00:12:10.430 --> 00:12:10.440 align:start position:0%
through with his intention of shooting
 
00:12:13.150 --> 00:12:13.160 align:start position:0%
up a school that day whether it was PHS
 
00:12:16.230 --> 00:12:16.240 align:start position:0%
or another school and it seems just as
 
00:12:18.350 --> 00:12:18.360 align:start position:0%
miraculous that law enforcement was
 
00:12:20.509 --> 00:12:20.519 align:start position:0%
tipped off and was able to find him
 
00:12:22.829 --> 00:12:22.839 align:start position:0%
confiscate his we weapon stash and throw
 
00:12:25.430 --> 00:12:25.440 align:start position:0%
him in jail this man will get out of
 
00:12:27.670 --> 00:12:27.680 align:start position:0%
jail in 3 years and if he decides to
 
00:12:29.629 --> 00:12:29.639 align:start position:0%
come back to the Northeast come up the
 
00:12:32.829 --> 00:12:32.839 align:start position:0%
I95 Corridor he'll have to pass 11
 
00:12:35.790 --> 00:12:35.800 align:start position:0%
States before he gets to one that allows
 
00:12:37.550 --> 00:12:37.560 align:start position:0%
him to get a firearm without a
 
00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:40.160 align:start position:0%
background check that state is New
 
00:12:42.389 --> 00:12:42.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire once again the safety of
 
00:12:44.269 --> 00:12:44.279 align:start position:0%
granite Staters will be dependent on the
 
00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:47.360 align:start position:0%
whim and discretion of one person the
 
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:48.760 align:start position:0%
person deciding whether to run a
 
00:12:50.629 --> 00:12:50.639 align:start position:0%
background check or not a background
 
00:12:52.750 --> 00:12:52.760 align:start position:0%
check that would flag him as a felon and
 
00:12:55.310 --> 00:12:55.320 align:start position:0%
prohibit him from obtaining a firearm
 
00:12:57.269 --> 00:12:57.279 align:start position:0%
once again our Fates and those of our
 
00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800 align:start position:0%
children will be decided by luck and
 
00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480 align:start position:0%
miracles it takes more than luck and
 
00:13:04.389 --> 00:13:04.399 align:start position:0%
miracles to keep our kids and Community
 
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:06.720 align:start position:0%
safe it takes responsibility and
 
00:13:10.870 --> 00:13:10.880 align:start position:0%
Leadership please vote ought to pass for
 
00:13:15.949 --> 00:13:15.959 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:24.160 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:26.750 align:start position:0%
 
Moren

00:13:26.750 --> 00:13:26.760 align:start position:0%
Moren
 
00:13:32.430 --> 00:13:32.440 align:start position:0%
 
00:13:35.710 --> 00:13:35.720 align:start position:0%
okay um I'm unsure why two wildly
 
00:13:37.629 --> 00:13:37.639 align:start position:0%
unpopular gun control bills were meshed
 
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040 align:start position:0%
into one wildly unpopular gun control
 
00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:42.920 align:start position:0%
Bill Bill but here we are the background
 
00:13:44.550 --> 00:13:44.560 align:start position:0%
check portion of this bill was written
 
00:13:46.670 --> 00:13:46.680 align:start position:0%
by an outstate gun control organization
 
00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:49.480 align:start position:0%
from California over a decade ago
 
00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:51.680 align:start position:0%
there's a reason it has failed all these
 
00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:54.240 align:start position:0%
years the bill makes it impossible for
 
00:13:57.150 --> 00:13:57.160 align:start position:0%
women and others to get gun safety
 
00:13:59.189 --> 00:13:59.199 align:start position:0%
training classes from anyone other than
 
00:14:01.389 --> 00:14:01.399 align:start position:0%
multi-billion dollar Corporation or the
 
00:14:03.269 --> 00:14:03.279 align:start position:0%
few ranges that have gun shops attached
 
00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:05.680 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire in those cases the
 
00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:07.360 align:start position:0%
costs are increased and that impedes
 
00:14:09.910 --> 00:14:09.920 align:start position:0%
low-income women the most this bill
 
00:14:12.430 --> 00:14:12.440 align:start position:0%
makes it unfeasible for most private
 
00:14:15.710 --> 00:14:15.720 align:start position:0%
instructors to teach gun safety training
 
00:14:17.350 --> 00:14:17.360 align:start position:0%
which is what the people proposing this
 
00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:19.800 align:start position:0%
legislation claims they support you
 
00:14:21.949 --> 00:14:21.959 align:start position:0%
cannot claim to be for gun safety then
 
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
push legislation that does exact the
 
00:14:26.949 --> 00:14:26.959 align:start position:0%
exact opposite of supporting gun
 
00:14:29.389 --> 00:14:29.399 align:start position:0%
safety on to the second part the
 
00:14:31.990 --> 00:14:32.000 align:start position:0%
mandatory waiting period the proponents
 
00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:34.720 align:start position:0%
of this legislation claim it's to curb
 
00:14:37.269 --> 00:14:37.279 align:start position:0%
Those who commit suicide using a firearm
 
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:39.360 align:start position:0%
the fact that this bill targets only
 
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440 align:start position:0%
those who purchase firearms and does
 
00:14:43.430 --> 00:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
nothing to increase suicide awareness
 
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:45.720 align:start position:0%
awareness or propose more help for those
 
00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:48.120 align:start position:0%
who may feel suicidal shows the bill is
 
00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:50.040 align:start position:0%
about control and not helping those in
 
00:14:52.470 --> 00:14:52.480 align:start position:0%
need it's not that they care more about
 
00:14:54.710 --> 00:14:54.720 align:start position:0%
the people using a firearm for suicide
 
00:14:56.350 --> 00:14:56.360 align:start position:0%
over Those who commit suicide in other
 
00:14:59.230 --> 00:14:59.240 align:start position:0%
ways it's about control there are are
 
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:01.320 align:start position:0%
women who have had to get a firearm in
 
00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:03.720 align:start position:0%
emergency situations some to protect
 
00:15:05.030 --> 00:15:05.040 align:start position:0%
themselves from violent stalkers or
 
00:15:07.749 --> 00:15:07.759 align:start position:0%
abusers like you were mentioning
 
00:15:09.749 --> 00:15:09.759 align:start position:0%
chairman waiting three days to a
 
00:15:11.189 --> 00:15:11.199 align:start position:0%
purchase a firearm would have resulted
 
00:15:13.710 --> 00:15:13.720 align:start position:0%
in those women being murdered this bill
 
00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:15.199 align:start position:0%
would enable their
 
00:15:17.389 --> 00:15:17.399 align:start position:0%
murderers according to the New Hampshire
 
00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:20.680 align:start position:0%
DHS HHS site the number of suicides
 
00:15:23.389 --> 00:15:23.399 align:start position:0%
decreased in 2023 I think this is an
 
00:15:25.590 --> 00:15:25.600 align:start position:0%
excellent Trend we can all agree on most
 
00:15:27.189 --> 00:15:27.199 align:start position:0%
likely it's due to getting people the
 
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:29.800 align:start position:0%
help in resources they need harming
 
00:15:31.710 --> 00:15:31.720 align:start position:0%
others who seek to protect practice
 
00:15:33.430 --> 00:15:33.440 align:start position:0%
their fundamental human right to
 
00:15:36.030 --> 00:15:36.040 align:start position:0%
self-defense especially women where it
 
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240 align:start position:0%
can literally mean their life or death
 
00:15:41.829 --> 00:15:41.839 align:start position:0%
does nothing but Implement Draconian gun
 
00:15:43.790 --> 00:15:43.800 align:start position:0%
control measure measures that have no
 
00:15:45.629 --> 00:15:45.639 align:start position:0%
place in Live Free or Die in the Live
 
00:15:47.470 --> 00:15:47.480 align:start position:0%
Free or Die State especially if you
 
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:49.920 align:start position:0%
claim to be for women's rights please
 
00:15:51.749 --> 00:15:51.759 align:start position:0%
vote inexpedient to legislate on this
 
00:15:54.550 --> 00:15:54.560 align:start position:0%
bill it do does nothing to increase gun
 
00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:56.839 align:start position:0%
safety or decrease suicide and it does
 
00:15:58.710 --> 00:15:58.720 align:start position:0%
everything to decrease the safety of
 
00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:02.000 align:start position:0%
women in New Hampshire thank you thank
 
00:16:03.189 --> 00:16:03.199 align:start position:0%
you for your
 
00:16:05.629 --> 00:16:05.639 align:start position:0%
testimony sure
 
00:16:08.269 --> 00:16:08.279 align:start position:0%
ahead excuse me uh I'm going to keep
 
00:16:09.710 --> 00:16:09.720 align:start position:0%
asking the same question till I get an
 
00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:11.720 align:start position:0%
answer from somebody do you know the
 
00:16:14.030 --> 00:16:14.040 align:start position:0%
number of suicides that are suicide by
 
00:16:18.030 --> 00:16:18.040 align:start position:0%
gun um you know what I looked re did all
 
00:16:20.389 --> 00:16:20.399 align:start position:0%
kinds of research in New Hampshire and I
 
00:16:22.389 --> 00:16:22.399 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it on any of the websites
 
00:16:25.550 --> 00:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
there was 21 suicides in New Hampshire
 
00:16:28.309 --> 00:16:28.319 align:start position:0%
in 2023 and the last time when I did
 
00:16:29.749 --> 00:16:29.759 align:start position:0%
find the STA statistics it was about
 
00:16:32.309 --> 00:16:32.319 align:start position:0%
half so it was about 50% um the last
 
00:16:33.470 --> 00:16:33.480 align:start position:0%
time I looked which was a couple of
 
00:16:35.430 --> 00:16:35.440 align:start position:0%
years ago same Bill thank you you're
 
00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:37.319 align:start position:0%
welcome to save you from having to look
 
00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:38.880 align:start position:0%
that up further I believe it's available
 
00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:42.600 align:start position:0%
on the FBI's website um who's
 
00:17:01.590 --> 00:17:01.600 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:03.150 --> 00:17:03.160 align:start position:0%
good morning thank you for hearing my
 
00:17:05.870 --> 00:17:05.880 align:start position:0%
brief testimony my name is Marcela duie
 
00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
I am a volunteer member of Mom's demand
 
00:17:11.309 --> 00:17:11.319 align:start position:0%
action I am also the suicide prevention
 
00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:15.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:17.360 align:start position:0%
Demand I'm going to try and keep it
 
00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:19.400 align:start position:0%
under three minutes and if it's possible
 
00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:22.400 align:start position:0%
if I can yield my time to someone
 
00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.710 align:start position:0%
if I can yield my time to someone
else

00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:24.720 align:start position:0%
else
 
00:17:27.590 --> 00:17:27.600 align:start position:0%
okay a waiting period law requires a
 
00:17:29.430 --> 00:17:29.440 align:start position:0%
certain number of days to collapse
 
00:17:31.590 --> 00:17:31.600 align:start position:0%
between the purchase of a firearm and
 
00:17:33.390 --> 00:17:33.400 align:start position:0%
when the buyer can actually take
 
00:17:35.950 --> 00:17:35.960 align:start position:0%
possession of that gun by delaying the
 
00:17:38.549 --> 00:17:38.559 align:start position:0%
immediate access to Firearms waiting
 
00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:41.000 align:start position:0%
periods can create an an important
 
00:17:43.909 --> 00:17:43.919 align:start position:0%
cooling off period that can help prevent
 
00:17:46.549 --> 00:17:46.559 align:start position:0%
impulsive acts of gun violence including
 
00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:49.200 align:start position:0%
gun homicides and gun
 
00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:51.520 align:start position:0%
suicides the immediate purchase and
 
00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880 align:start position:0%
acquisition of a gun allows people to
 
00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:56.720 align:start position:0%
act on temporary emotions and
 
00:17:58.870 --> 00:17:58.880 align:start position:0%
impulses which can increase the risk
 
00:18:01.549 --> 00:18:01.559 align:start position:0%
risk of both gun suicides and gun
 
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:04.760 align:start position:0%
homicide suicide attempts are often
 
00:18:07.870 --> 00:18:07.880 align:start position:0%
impulsive singular episodes that involve
 
00:18:11.070 --> 00:18:11.080 align:start position:0%
little planning many studies suggest
 
00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:13.760 align:start position:0%
that most suicide survivors contemplated
 
00:18:16.830 --> 00:18:16.840 align:start position:0%
their actions for only a brief period of
 
00:18:20.270 --> 00:18:20.280 align:start position:0%
time often less than 24 hours before
 
00:18:23.830 --> 00:18:23.840 align:start position:0%
 
00:18:26.909 --> 00:18:26.919 align:start position:0%
attempt waiting period laws which create
 
00:18:29.549 --> 00:18:29.559 align:start position:0%
a buffer between the time of a gun
 
00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:32.480 align:start position:0%
purchase and a gun acquisition can help
 
00:18:34.870 --> 00:18:34.880 align:start position:0%
to prevent impulsive acts of gun
 
00:18:37.029 --> 00:18:37.039 align:start position:0%
violence and for those who are worried
 
00:18:39.830 --> 00:18:39.840 align:start position:0%
about the women who need to protect
 
00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:42.600 align:start position:0%
themselves against their abuser this
 
00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:44.710 align:start position:0%
themselves against their abuser this
would

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:44.720 align:start position:0%
would
 
00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:47.720 align:start position:0%
also uh Pro protect her if somebody
 
00:18:50.029 --> 00:18:50.039 align:start position:0%
needed to buy a gun and they wanted to
 
00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:52.960 align:start position:0%
um attack their domestic partner Works
 
00:18:56.470 --> 00:18:56.480 align:start position:0%
in both ways um studies suggest that the
 
00:18:58.990 --> 00:18:59.000 align:start position:0%
waiting period laws are associated with
 
00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:02.600 align:start position:0%
reduced rates of firearms suicide by one
 
00:19:04.830 --> 00:19:04.840 align:start position:0%
estimation waiting period laws May
 
00:19:08.390 --> 00:19:08.400 align:start position:0%
reduce firearm suicide rates by 7 to
 
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:11.760 align:start position:0%
11% waiting period laws also appear to
 
00:19:14.750 --> 00:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
reduce gun homicide rates one study
 
00:19:17.789 --> 00:19:17.799 align:start position:0%
found that waiting period laws that
 
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:20.080 align:start position:0%
delay the purchase of firearms by only a
 
00:19:22.510 --> 00:19:22.520 align:start position:0%
few days can reduce gun homicides by
 
00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:25.870 align:start position:0%
few days can reduce gun homicides by
roughly

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:25.880 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:30.630 --> 00:19:30.640 align:start position:0%
177% and just to keep this short
 
00:19:34.070 --> 00:19:34.080 align:start position:0%
I would just like to briefly list one of
 
00:19:37.110 --> 00:19:37.120 align:start position:0%

good morning everyone um I represent uh
 
00:22:08.950 --> 00:22:08.960 align:start position:0%
women for gun rights I'm the state
 
00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:11.240 align:start position:0%
director here in New Hampshire and I
 
00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:13.400 align:start position:0%
just want to throw my weight behind uh
 
00:22:15.549 --> 00:22:15.559 align:start position:0%
the testimonies of all those opposing
 
00:22:18.909 --> 00:22:18.919 align:start position:0%
this bill today and just add to that um
 
00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:21.360 align:start position:0%
that the the redundancy of this bill as
 
00:22:23.390 --> 00:22:23.400 align:start position:0%
there are already multiple laws in place
 
00:22:25.390 --> 00:22:25.400 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire and and on a federal
 
00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.120 align:start position:0%
level that prohibit um the possession of
 
00:22:30.789 --> 00:22:30.799 align:start position:0%
firearms Arms by people with uh who have
 
00:22:32.750 --> 00:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
been deemed mentally defected or they're
 
00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:36.159 align:start position:0%
felons uh you're not allowed to give um
 
00:22:38.390 --> 00:22:38.400 align:start position:0%
guns to miners there are already
 
00:22:41.470 --> 00:22:41.480 align:start position:0%
penalties in place for that and to point
 
00:22:43.310 --> 00:22:43.320 align:start position:0%
out that if you want to buy a gun in New
 
00:22:44.789 --> 00:22:44.799 align:start position:0%
Hampshire you need a background check
 
00:22:47.830 --> 00:22:47.840 align:start position:0%
that is true that's exactly what happens
 
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:49.960 align:start position:0%
if you want to gift a gun if you want to
 
00:22:52.950 --> 00:22:52.960 align:start position:0%
transfer a gun that is up to the
 
00:22:55.950 --> 00:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
responsible gun owner and them alone
 
00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:57.919 align:start position:0%
there are already laws in place that
 
00:23:00.029 --> 00:23:00.039 align:start position:0%
will pen ize them if they do the wrong
 
00:23:02.029 --> 00:23:02.039 align:start position:0%
thing the responsibility is on them to
 
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:04.360 align:start position:0%
make the right decision and I also want
 
00:23:07.549 --> 00:23:07.559 align:start position:0%
to note that um it's not known that
 
00:23:10.110 --> 00:23:10.120 align:start position:0%
felons and mentally ill people go by the
 
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:12.760 align:start position:0%
book um this bill will
 
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:16.120 align:start position:0%
actually not do anything to stop that uh
 
00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:18.480 align:start position:0%
drug dealers and people looking to
 
00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:20.520 align:start position:0%
commit crimes will not go together to
 
00:23:23.029 --> 00:23:23.039 align:start position:0%
their local FFL to fill out paperwork
 
00:23:25.510 --> 00:23:25.520 align:start position:0%
and hand over their details it's it's
 
00:23:27.990 --> 00:23:28.000 align:start position:0%
just not how it life works if we're
 
00:23:31.029 --> 00:23:31.039 align:start position:0%
talking about common sense um and I also
 
00:23:32.750 --> 00:23:32.760 align:start position:0%
just wanted to point out that this type
 
00:23:34.909 --> 00:23:34.919 align:start position:0%
of Bill would leave women quite
 
00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:37.640 align:start position:0%
vulnerable um one in six are stalked one
 
00:23:39.669 --> 00:23:39.679 align:start position:0%
in four are raped one in three are the
 
00:23:41.789 --> 00:23:41.799 align:start position:0%
victims of domestic violence if they
 
00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:45.520 align:start position:0%
should need to um have protection they
 
00:23:47.510 --> 00:23:47.520 align:start position:0%
ought to be able to get that as quickly
 
00:23:49.669 --> 00:23:49.679 align:start position:0%
as possible and I did just want to
 
00:23:51.029 --> 00:23:51.039 align:start position:0%
quickly mention I wasn't going to say
 
00:23:54.269 --> 00:23:54.279 align:start position:0%
anything about suicide um but just for a
 
00:23:56.669 --> 00:23:56.679 align:start position:0%
touch of reality where I'm originally
 
00:23:58.430 --> 00:23:58.440 align:start position:0%
from in Australia where guns were conf
 
00:24:01.430 --> 00:24:01.440 align:start position:0%
confiscated um back in
 
00:24:03.669 --> 00:24:03.679 align:start position:0%
1996 uh the effect of that on the
 
00:24:06.789 --> 00:24:06.799 align:start position:0%
suicide rates is that before that time
 
00:24:09.710 --> 00:24:09.720 align:start position:0%
uh suicides were mostly about 50% by
 
00:24:13.110 --> 00:24:13.120 align:start position:0%
firearm um nowadays uh that is just
 
00:24:15.549 --> 00:24:15.559 align:start position:0%
replaced by hanging they find a rope or
 
00:24:17.789 --> 00:24:17.799 align:start position:0%
a belt or something like that and they
 
00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:20.360 align:start position:0%
do what they intend to do so actually
 
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:22.400 align:start position:0%
where suicides are concerned and
 
00:24:24.149 --> 00:24:24.159 align:start position:0%
lowering the suicide
 
00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:27.360 align:start position:0%
rate unfortunately it's so very sad but
 
00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:29.760 align:start position:0%
if people want to do that they will find
 
00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.440 align:start position:0%
a way to do that I'm sorry to end on
 
00:24:35.029 --> 00:24:35.039 align:start position:0%
that note but that concludes my
 
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:43.520 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:47.269 --> 00:24:47.279 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair calls Nick pinich if
 
00:24:54.230 --> 00:24:54.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:24:56.549 --> 00:24:56.559 align:start position:0%
right thank you chair committee for
 
00:24:58.430 --> 00:24:58.440 align:start position:0%
letting me speak my name is uh ni
 
00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:01.240 align:start position:0%
penovich I'm a retired U trauma surgeon
 
00:25:02.750 --> 00:25:02.760 align:start position:0%
I was a general and vascular surgeon
 
00:25:05.630 --> 00:25:05.640 align:start position:0%
conquered hospital but during 40-year
 
00:25:07.389 --> 00:25:07.399 align:start position:0%
career which ended about a decade ago as
 
00:25:09.029 --> 00:25:09.039 align:start position:0%
far as taking direct care of people it
 
00:25:12.590 --> 00:25:12.600 align:start position:0%
was uh always saying being on call um
 
00:25:13.950 --> 00:25:13.960 align:start position:0%
being available at night take care of
 
00:25:16.430 --> 00:25:16.440 align:start position:0%
trauma most traumas were and gun trauma
 
00:25:19.149 --> 00:25:19.159 align:start position:0%
were at night um to answer represented
 
00:25:21.789 --> 00:25:21.799 align:start position:0%
sher's question um I think the data that
 
00:25:25.230 --> 00:25:25.240 align:start position:0%
I were on suicide guns and so forth uh
 
00:25:26.789 --> 00:25:26.799 align:start position:0%
Hospital data you know when people get
 
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:28.840 align:start position:0%
to a hospital if it's a suicide
 
00:25:32.870 --> 00:25:32.880 align:start position:0%
attempt uh and PE taken all the suicide
 
00:25:34.190 --> 00:25:34.200 align:start position:0%
attempts whether they're successful or
 
00:25:37.190 --> 00:25:37.200 align:start position:0%
not dying uh it's about 5% were involved
 
00:25:38.549 --> 00:25:38.559 align:start position:0%
with guns and most people still take
 
00:25:42.029 --> 00:25:42.039 align:start position:0%
drugs or I hanging maybe in Australia um
 
00:25:43.950 --> 00:25:43.960 align:start position:0%
but if you do use a gun you're more than
 
00:25:46.310 --> 00:25:46.320 align:start position:0%
50% successful so the debts if you take
 
00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:47.960 align:start position:0%
all the suicide debts that the hospitals
 
00:25:50.029 --> 00:25:50.039 align:start position:0%
deal with more than a little over 50% of
 
00:25:52.190 --> 00:25:52.200 align:start position:0%
them are guns so that that's pretty up
 
00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000 align:start position:0%
to dat data I think uh even though I
 
00:25:57.149 --> 00:25:57.159 align:start position:0%
haven't operated on anybody and for
 
00:25:59.310 --> 00:25:59.320 align:start position:0%
trauma in a decade I still teach I'm up
 
00:26:01.710 --> 00:26:01.720 align:start position:0%
tomorrow today in Lebanon with medical
 
00:26:03.470 --> 00:26:03.480 align:start position:0%
students and residents this morning in
 
00:26:05.029 --> 00:26:05.039 align:start position:0%
conquer so I'm still teaching and trying
 
00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:08.080 align:start position:0%
to keep up to date uh a little I just
 
00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:10.840 align:start position:0%
want you to my perspective um it's a
 
00:26:12.669 --> 00:26:12.679 align:start position:0%
different persective because once
 
00:26:14.350 --> 00:26:14.360 align:start position:0%
Badness happens with a gun or without a
 
00:26:16.430 --> 00:26:16.440 align:start position:0%
gun we're there but Mo we surgeons with
 
00:26:19.350 --> 00:26:19.360 align:start position:0%
a gun when Sandy Hook happened in
 
00:26:22.630 --> 00:26:22.640 align:start position:0%
2012 one of the pr surgeons I train with
 
00:26:24.430 --> 00:26:24.440 align:start position:0%
his name is Lynn Jacobs head of at
 
00:26:26.789 --> 00:26:26.799 align:start position:0%
Hartford chief of surgery and Trauma
 
00:26:28.549 --> 00:26:28.559 align:start position:0%
he's a guy that got the call about Andy
 
00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:30.240 align:start position:0%
hook all those kids being damaged and
 
00:26:32.549 --> 00:26:32.559 align:start position:0%
the first call was be ready uh CU
 
00:26:33.950 --> 00:26:33.960 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of damage here we don't
 
00:26:36.909 --> 00:26:36.919 align:start position:0%
know how bad it is the second call was
 
00:26:38.750 --> 00:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
uh half an hour later where he called so
 
00:26:40.990 --> 00:26:41.000 align:start position:0%
what's happening the answer is forget it
 
00:26:43.549 --> 00:26:43.559 align:start position:0%
they're all dead and he was asked the
 
00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600 align:start position:0%
next day to go down and look at all the
 
00:26:48.269 --> 00:26:48.279 align:start position:0%
autopsies and that generated an interest
 
00:26:50.350 --> 00:26:50.360 align:start position:0%
in the American College of Surgeons my
 
00:26:52.630 --> 00:26:52.640 align:start position:0%
educational not so much a union group in
 
00:26:55.190 --> 00:26:55.200 align:start position:0%
DC but a big educational group and
 
00:26:56.830 --> 00:26:56.840 align:start position:0%
within about 6 months the College of
 
00:26:58.269 --> 00:26:58.279 align:start position:0%
Surgeons of which I'm still a member
 
00:27:00.230 --> 00:27:00.240 align:start position:0%
representing myself basically came out
 
00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:02.200 align:start position:0%
with uh stop the bleed so when you look
 
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:05.080 align:start position:0%
at an AED in a high school or anywhere
 
00:27:06.630 --> 00:27:06.640 align:start position:0%
there's a tourniquet there that's all we
 
00:27:08.269 --> 00:27:08.279 align:start position:0%
did in other words said let's stop the
 
00:27:10.269 --> 00:27:10.279 align:start position:0%
bleeding as well as uh being able to use
 
00:27:12.789 --> 00:27:12.799 align:start position:0%
the AED however it also started a
 
00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:15.640 align:start position:0%
commission that reported in 2017 five
 
00:27:17.950 --> 00:27:17.960 align:start position:0%
years later of surgeons and they they
 
00:27:20.710 --> 00:27:20.720 align:start position:0%
picked asked many trauma surgeons from
 
00:27:22.990 --> 00:27:23.000 align:start position:0%
major trauma hospitals con Dartmouth had
 
00:27:24.230 --> 00:27:24.240 align:start position:0%
a represent did not have a
 
00:27:25.510 --> 00:27:25.520 align:start position:0%
representative on that but they made
 
00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:27.200 align:start position:0%
sure that the 15 people on that
 
00:27:29.230 --> 00:27:29.240 align:start position:0%
Commission 13 of them were members of
 
00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.029 align:start position:0%
Commission 13 of them were members of
the

00:27:30.029 --> 00:27:30.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:27:32.389 --> 00:27:32.399 align:start position:0%
NRA so they wanted to see what surgeons
 
00:27:34.630 --> 00:27:34.640 align:start position:0%
who were members of the NRA wanted and
 
00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:37.120 align:start position:0%
this type of bill was number one on the
 
00:27:39.510 --> 00:27:39.520 align:start position:0%
list and they're still pushing for that
 
00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120 align:start position:0%
in Congress and so forth so it's a
 
00:27:43.110 --> 00:27:43.120 align:start position:0%
different perspective I know it has a
 
00:27:44.789 --> 00:27:44.799 align:start position:0%
lot to do at rights but those of us in
 
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:46.320 align:start position:0%
the trenches Grant I haven't been there
 
00:27:48.190 --> 00:27:48.200 align:start position:0%
in 10 years have a different perspective
 
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:49.960 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to share with you we clean
 
00:27:53.190 --> 00:27:53.200 align:start position:0%
up the mess and try to save
 
00:27:55.350 --> 00:27:55.360 align:start position:0%
lives that's all I have to say any
 
00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:58.230 align:start position:0%
lives that's all I have to say any
questions

00:27:58.230 --> 00:27:58.240 align:start position:0%
questions
 
00:28:01.470 --> 00:28:01.480 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much for your
 
00:28:13.350 --> 00:28:13.360 align:start position:0%
 
00:28:15.310 --> 00:28:15.320 align:start position:0%
Davis good morning chair honorable
 
00:28:16.750 --> 00:28:16.760 align:start position:0%
members of the committee my name is
 
00:28:18.630 --> 00:28:18.640 align:start position:0%
Justin Davis I represent the National
 
00:28:20.269 --> 00:28:20.279 align:start position:0%
Rifle Association here in New Hampshire
 
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:22.960 align:start position:0%
I am a New Hampshire resident as well um
 
00:28:24.830 --> 00:28:24.840 align:start position:0%
as already noted this bill combines two
 
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
perennial failed bills from California T
 
00:28:28.509 --> 00:28:28.519 align:start position:0%
gun control into one which which is a
 
00:28:30.470 --> 00:28:30.480 align:start position:0%
pretty interesting political tactic to
 
00:28:31.789 --> 00:28:31.799 align:start position:0%
take but we'll kind of split this up
 
00:28:33.470 --> 00:28:33.480 align:start position:0%
into two things waiting periods as well
 
00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:35.840 align:start position:0%
as the universal background check bill
 
00:28:38.149 --> 00:28:38.159 align:start position:0%
um so as noted uh this bill would set up
 
00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:39.720 align:start position:0%
a three-day arbitrary waiting period for
 
00:28:41.110 --> 00:28:41.120 align:start position:0%
folks who already go through a legal
 
00:28:42.750 --> 00:28:42.760 align:start position:0%
background check so you go to your local
 
00:28:45.070 --> 00:28:45.080 align:start position:0%
FFL you buy a new Glock you go and you
 
00:28:46.549 --> 00:28:46.559 align:start position:0%
get your background check you pass your
 
00:28:47.590 --> 00:28:47.600 align:start position:0%
background check well now you have to
 
00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:49.480 align:start position:0%
wait three days for the sake of waiting
 
00:28:52.669 --> 00:28:52.679 align:start position:0%
three days um this denies an individual
 
00:28:54.149 --> 00:28:54.159 align:start position:0%
right to their urgent self-defense as
 
00:28:56.190 --> 00:28:56.200 align:start position:0%
noted women who are uh endangered from
 
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:57.360 align:start position:0%
an abuser who need immediate
 
00:28:59.789 --> 00:28:59.799 align:start position:0%
self-defense are in particular for this
 
00:29:01.590 --> 00:29:01.600 align:start position:0%
uh although they can obtain a piece of
 
00:29:02.990 --> 00:29:03.000 align:start position:0%
paper that says a protection from abuse
 
00:29:05.190 --> 00:29:05.200 align:start position:0%
order as we've seen before that does not
 
00:29:08.110 --> 00:29:08.120 align:start position:0%
always result in a safe situation um it
 
00:29:09.669 --> 00:29:09.679 align:start position:0%
also has a major impact on the economy
 
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:11.320 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire's home to over 10,000
 
00:29:13.230 --> 00:29:13.240 align:start position:0%
2A related firearm jobs that creates
 
00:29:15.110 --> 00:29:15.120 align:start position:0%
over multiple billions and dollars in
 
00:29:17.149 --> 00:29:17.159 align:start position:0%
economic impact um as you probably know
 
00:29:18.669 --> 00:29:18.679 align:start position:0%
Maine has also passed a saving to our
 
00:29:20.710 --> 00:29:20.720 align:start position:0%
waiting period uh they've had a 10%
 
00:29:22.549 --> 00:29:22.559 align:start position:0%
decrease in background checks which can
 
00:29:24.269 --> 00:29:24.279 align:start position:0%
kind of tell us about the firearm sales
 
00:29:25.950 --> 00:29:25.960 align:start position:0%
ironically enough they've also B passed
 
00:29:28.230 --> 00:29:28.240 align:start position:0%
a universal background check um in
 
00:29:29.430 --> 00:29:29.440 align:start position:0%
response to that New Hampshire seen a
 
00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:31.799 align:start position:0%
10% increase so what we're seeing here
 
00:29:34.830 --> 00:29:34.840 align:start position:0%
is that individuals will uh leave the
 
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:36.840 align:start position:0%
state to buy firearms folks who come
 
00:29:38.470 --> 00:29:38.480 align:start position:0%
here for hunting Recreation who may come
 
00:29:40.630 --> 00:29:40.640 align:start position:0%
here to buy a firearm to hunt will no
 
00:29:41.870 --> 00:29:41.880 align:start position:0%
longer come to New Hampshire to hunt
 
00:29:43.590 --> 00:29:43.600 align:start position:0%
further impacting our Ral economy so
 
00:29:45.029 --> 00:29:45.039 align:start position:0%
this is beyond a public safety issue
 
00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120 align:start position:0%
it's also a very real Financial issue um
 
00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:50.440 align:start position:0%
regarding Universal background checks um
 
00:29:52.230 --> 00:29:52.240 align:start position:0%
folks who say that you can buy firearm
 
00:29:53.549 --> 00:29:53.559 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire without a background
 
00:29:55.310 --> 00:29:55.320 align:start position:0%
check are are really misleading right so
 
00:29:56.990 --> 00:29:57.000 align:start position:0%
like we said before if you go to an FFL
 
00:29:58.230 --> 00:29:58.240 align:start position:0%
you have to pass a background ground
 
00:30:00.549 --> 00:30:00.559 align:start position:0%
check um and folks who do private
 
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:03.080 align:start position:0%
transfers uh are very aware that if you
 
00:30:04.630 --> 00:30:04.640 align:start position:0%
uh transfer firearm to a prohibited
 
00:30:06.509 --> 00:30:06.519 align:start position:0%
individual well that's a crime so
 
00:30:08.110 --> 00:30:08.120 align:start position:0%
typically a lot of these transfers are
 
00:30:09.750 --> 00:30:09.760 align:start position:0%
friend to friend family member to family
 
00:30:11.509 --> 00:30:11.519 align:start position:0%
member and folks who may not know the
 
00:30:13.669 --> 00:30:13.679 align:start position:0%
individual can still go to an FFL and
 
00:30:14.950 --> 00:30:14.960 align:start position:0%
get that background check right they'll
 
00:30:17.509 --> 00:30:17.519 align:start position:0%
pay maybe a $50 fee for a transfer fee
 
00:30:19.549 --> 00:30:19.559 align:start position:0%
that background check will be run and uh
 
00:30:21.350 --> 00:30:21.360 align:start position:0%
that will be processed through there by
 
00:30:23.070 --> 00:30:23.080 align:start position:0%
mandating this uh once again you're
 
00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:25.480 align:start position:0%
really harming the ability for folks to
 
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:26.720 align:start position:0%
have the New Hampshire tradition of
 
00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:28.399 align:start position:0%
lending a firearm to a family member or
 
00:30:30.669 --> 00:30:30.679 align:start position:0%
friend selling a firearm to a coworker
 
00:30:32.990 --> 00:30:33.000 align:start position:0%
who they know are not prohibited um and
 
00:30:35.029 --> 00:30:35.039 align:start position:0%
there's also this idea that you know
 
00:30:37.350 --> 00:30:37.360 align:start position:0%
criminals are going to do private sales
 
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:38.880 align:start position:0%
and buying it from somebody through
 
00:30:40.310 --> 00:30:40.320 align:start position:0%
without a universal background check
 
00:30:41.590 --> 00:30:41.600 align:start position:0%
well the Obama Administration actually
 
00:30:44.110 --> 00:30:44.120 align:start position:0%
found that 90% of crimes with a Firearms
 
00:30:45.190 --> 00:30:45.200 align:start position:0%
were actually used through straw
 
00:30:47.310 --> 00:30:47.320 align:start position:0%
purchase and theft once again you put a
 
00:30:49.230 --> 00:30:49.240 align:start position:0%
universal background check law in place
 
00:30:51.070 --> 00:30:51.080 align:start position:0%
individuals who are criminals who by
 
00:30:52.789 --> 00:30:52.799 align:start position:0%
definition will not follow the law we'll
 
00:30:54.950 --> 00:30:54.960 align:start position:0%
find ways to obtain firearms and simply
 
00:30:57.070 --> 00:30:57.080 align:start position:0%
put a burden on law- abiding citizens so
 
00:30:58.389 --> 00:30:58.399 align:start position:0%
I'm happy to answer any questions you
 
00:30:59.710 --> 00:30:59.720 align:start position:0%
have I know you have a lot of testimony
 
00:31:03.509 --> 00:31:03.519 align:start position:0%
 
00:31:06.509 --> 00:31:06.519 align:start position:0%
short representative
 
00:31:09.509 --> 00:31:09.519 align:start position:0%
cells yes thank you for taking my
 
00:31:13.430 --> 00:31:13.440 align:start position:0%
question of course a lot is made for the
 
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:17.840 align:start position:0%
lack of control here in New Hampshire as
 
00:31:18.950 --> 00:31:18.960 align:start position:0%
far as the
 
00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:21.120 align:start position:0%
transfer uh of
 
00:31:24.110 --> 00:31:24.120 align:start position:0%
firearms do you have any statistics
 
00:31:26.389 --> 00:31:26.399 align:start position:0%
comparing New
 
00:31:28.629 --> 00:31:28.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's um
 
00:31:34.470 --> 00:31:34.480 align:start position:0%
uh rate of uh uh firearm uh uh deaths as
 
00:31:39.310 --> 00:31:39.320 align:start position:0%
compared to a more strict State such as
 
00:31:42.310 --> 00:31:42.320 align:start position:0%
Connecticut or New York or California or
 
00:31:45.269 --> 00:31:45.279 align:start position:0%
Illinois do you have any statistics how
 
00:31:48.149 --> 00:31:48.159 align:start position:0%
does New Hampshire compare where the
 
00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:50.720 align:start position:0%
Live Free or Die State how does New
 
00:31:53.549 --> 00:31:53.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire compare to some of these more
 
00:31:55.669 --> 00:31:55.679 align:start position:0%
strict States absolutely I appreciate
 
00:31:56.870 --> 00:31:56.880 align:start position:0%
that question well I'm sure all of you
 
00:31:57.990 --> 00:31:58.000 align:start position:0%
know on criminal justice that New
 
00:31:59.629 --> 00:31:59.639 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is proudly the safest state in
 
00:32:01.590 --> 00:32:01.600 align:start position:0%
the country right so for criminal
 
00:32:03.350 --> 00:32:03.360 align:start position:0%
activity there's no better place to live
 
00:32:04.310 --> 00:32:04.320 align:start position:0%
if you want to be safe than New
 
00:32:06.590 --> 00:32:06.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and the opposite of that if
 
00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:08.240 align:start position:0%
you go to places like California or some
 
00:32:09.430 --> 00:32:09.440 align:start position:0%
of these places that have very high
 
00:32:11.470 --> 00:32:11.480 align:start position:0%
levels of gun control they're much less
 
00:32:13.190 --> 00:32:13.200 align:start position:0%
safe by a per capita standard as well as
 
00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:14.600 align:start position:0%
a violent crime rate I don't have those
 
00:32:15.950 --> 00:32:15.960 align:start position:0%
off the top of my hand I'm happy to
 
00:32:17.230 --> 00:32:17.240 align:start position:0%
compile a document and provide that to
 
00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.029 align:start position:0%
compile a document and provide that to
the

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:18.039 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:32:20.509 --> 00:32:20.519 align:start position:0%
committee thank you and um just for
 
00:32:22.909 --> 00:32:22.919 align:start position:0%
everyone as I said to the professor um
 
00:32:24.590 --> 00:32:24.600 align:start position:0%
very detailed statistics are available
 
00:32:28.230 --> 00:32:28.240 align:start position:0%
on the web FBI website absolutely
 
00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.990 align:start position:0%
on the web FBI website absolutely
representative

00:32:29.990 --> 00:32:30.000 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:32:33.230 --> 00:32:33.240 align:start position:0%
Bart thank you Mr chairman for allowing
 
00:32:35.269 --> 00:32:35.279 align:start position:0%
me to ask the question and thank you for
 
00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:38.080 align:start position:0%
taking my question course could you tell
 
00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:40.960 align:start position:0%
me what the average time it takes to
 
00:32:44.269 --> 00:32:44.279 align:start position:0%
have a background check
 
00:32:46.350 --> 00:32:46.360 align:start position:0%
performed typically it's it's the
 
00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:47.600 align:start position:0%
national instant criminal background
 
00:32:48.909 --> 00:32:48.919 align:start position:0%
check system for a region so what
 
00:32:50.909 --> 00:32:50.919 align:start position:0%
happens is you fill out your 4473 it
 
00:32:52.310 --> 00:32:52.320 align:start position:0%
goes to the FFL they running through the
 
00:32:55.870 --> 00:32:55.880 align:start position:0%
FBI system it it purely depends a lot
 
00:32:57.269 --> 00:32:57.279 align:start position:0%
what you fill out your name I have a
 
00:32:58.789 --> 00:32:58.799 align:start position:0%
very common name I'm one of the on
 
00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:00.159 align:start position:0%
Fourth Justin day was the fourth so
 
00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039 align:start position:0%
sometimes it can take a little bit
 
00:33:02.830 --> 00:33:02.840 align:start position:0%
longer uh but typically you're in and
 
00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:05.360 align:start position:0%
out in several minutes uh sometimes it
 
00:33:07.350 --> 00:33:07.360 align:start position:0%
can take longer the FBI can delay that
 
00:33:09.990 --> 00:33:10.000 align:start position:0%
transfer if there's an issue um but it
 
00:33:11.830 --> 00:33:11.840 align:start position:0%
is a national background check system
 
00:33:14.509 --> 00:33:14.519 align:start position:0%
through the FBI that is meant to be
 
00:33:16.310 --> 00:33:16.320 align:start position:0%
instant thank
 
00:33:19.110 --> 00:33:19.120 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your testimony thank
 
00:33:21.549 --> 00:33:21.559 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:42.149 --> 00:33:42.159 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:44.830 --> 00:33:44.840 align:start position:0%
um honorable chair and members of the
 
00:33:46.909 --> 00:33:46.919 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Simon Thurber and
 
00:33:50.029 --> 00:33:50.039 align:start position:0%
I'm from exitor New Hampshire um I trust
 
00:33:51.549 --> 00:33:51.559 align:start position:0%
that we're all gathered here because we
 
00:33:53.310 --> 00:33:53.320 align:start position:0%
all have the best interest of every
 
00:33:56.269 --> 00:33:56.279 align:start position:0%
Granite stator in mind uh and what tops
 
00:33:59.830 --> 00:33:59.840 align:start position:0%
the list of best interest here is saving
 
00:34:02.549 --> 00:34:02.559 align:start position:0%
lives uh saving lives of children saving
 
00:34:04.029 --> 00:34:04.039 align:start position:0%
lives of veterans saving lives of all
 
00:34:06.549 --> 00:34:06.559 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters New Hampshire residents
 
00:34:09.629 --> 00:34:09.639 align:start position:0%
also cherish their freedoms but to be
 
00:34:11.869 --> 00:34:11.879 align:start position:0%
able to enjoy our freedoms we have to be
 
00:34:11.879 --> 00:34:13.149 align:start position:0%
able to enjoy our freedoms we have to be
alive

00:34:13.149 --> 00:34:13.159 align:start position:0%
alive
 
00:34:17.109 --> 00:34:17.119 align:start position:0%
first New Hampshire ranks ninth lowest
 
00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
in gun death rate according to the
 
00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:21.879 align:start position:0%
gord's law Center ranking ninth out of
 
00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.520 align:start position:0%
50 states sounds good but it also means
 
00:34:27.349 --> 00:34:27.359 align:start position:0%
that almost 20% of states are doing
 
00:34:29.990 --> 00:34:30.000 align:start position:0%
better than New Hampshire I don't want
 
00:34:32.069 --> 00:34:32.079 align:start position:0%
to settle for the nines I want New
 
00:34:34.950 --> 00:34:34.960 align:start position:0%
Hampshire to have the lowest gun death
 
00:34:36.030 --> 00:34:36.040 align:start position:0%
rate in the
 
00:34:38.349 --> 00:34:38.359 align:start position:0%
country now how can we lower our gun
 
00:34:40.230 --> 00:34:40.240 align:start position:0%
death rate and improve our
 
00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320 align:start position:0%
ranking uh how can we save at least some
 
00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:46.280 align:start position:0%
of the 141 lives that are lost to gun
 
00:34:48.550 --> 00:34:48.560 align:start position:0%
violence in our state on the average
 
00:34:48.560 --> 00:34:49.470 align:start position:0%
violence in our state on the average
every

00:34:49.470 --> 00:34:49.480 align:start position:0%
every
 
00:34:52.470 --> 00:34:52.480 align:start position:0%
year we may start by seeing what our
 
00:34:54.550 --> 00:34:54.560 align:start position:0%
neighbors are doing five of our
 
00:34:56.550 --> 00:34:56.560 align:start position:0%
Northeast neighbors Massachusetts Rhode
 
00:34:58.109 --> 00:34:58.119 align:start position:0%
Island New Jersey New York York and
 
00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
Connecticut have a lower gun rate death
 
00:35:03.310 --> 00:35:03.320 align:start position:0%
rate than New Hampshire and what do they
 
00:35:05.710 --> 00:35:05.720 align:start position:0%
all have in common they all conduct
 
00:35:07.950 --> 00:35:07.960 align:start position:0%
Universal background
 
00:35:11.270 --> 00:35:11.280 align:start position:0%
checks in New Hampshire licensed firearm
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
dealers conduct background checks but
 
00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:16.320 align:start position:0%
firearm sales at auctions gun shows and
 
00:35:18.790 --> 00:35:18.800 align:start position:0%
between private citizens don't follow
 
00:35:20.349 --> 00:35:20.359 align:start position:0%
these same high
 
00:35:23.470 --> 00:35:23.480 align:start position:0%
standards to save lives all firearm
 
00:35:25.109 --> 00:35:25.119 align:start position:0%
sales in New Hampshire with obviously
 
00:35:28.589 --> 00:35:28.599 align:start position:0%
some exceptions um should include a
 
00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:31.520 align:start position:0%
background check all parties should
 
00:35:34.589 --> 00:35:34.599 align:start position:0%
behave as professionally as licensed
 
00:35:36.870 --> 00:35:36.880 align:start position:0%
dealers we know Universal background
 
00:35:39.910 --> 00:35:39.920 align:start position:0%
checks save lives Granite Staters know
 
00:35:42.150 --> 00:35:42.160 align:start position:0%
that background checks do not infringe
 
00:35:43.349 --> 00:35:43.359 align:start position:0%
on their
 
00:35:46.390 --> 00:35:46.400 align:start position:0%
freedoms healthy law-abiding citizens
 
00:35:49.069 --> 00:35:49.079 align:start position:0%
who purchase a firearm wait only a few
 
00:35:52.309 --> 00:35:52.319 align:start position:0%
days which is a small ask for a life
 
00:35:52.319 --> 00:35:54.309 align:start position:0%
days which is a small ask for a life
saving

00:35:54.309 --> 00:35:54.319 align:start position:0%
saving
 
00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:57.240 align:start position:0%
benefit and now let me talk about
 
00:35:59.750 --> 00:35:59.760 align:start position:0%
waiting periods a brief waiting period
 
00:36:01.950 --> 00:36:01.960 align:start position:0%
would also prevent many deaths by
 
00:36:05.230 --> 00:36:05.240 align:start position:0%
suicide most firearm deaths are suicides
 
00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:07.440 align:start position:0%
and most suicide attempts take place
 
00:36:10.790 --> 00:36:10.800 align:start position:0%
within minutes of a person's decision to
 
00:36:13.710 --> 00:36:13.720 align:start position:0%
end their lives and besides there is
 
00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.589 align:start position:0%
end their lives and besides there is
about

00:36:14.589 --> 00:36:14.599 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:36:17.670 --> 00:36:17.680 align:start position:0%
90% 90% of suicide attempts with

don't get a second
chance

Psychotherapy an overwhelming number of
 
00:36:39.309 --> 00:36:39.319 align:start position:0%
suicide attempts happens rapidly from
 
00:36:43.309 --> 00:36:43.319 align:start position:0%
the decision to die to actual attempt a
 
00:36:47.349 --> 00:36:47.359 align:start position:0%
third over third 36% of people act
 
00:36:52.030 --> 00:36:52.040 align:start position:0%

man the chair recognizes The Honorable
 
00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:28.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:37:29.510 --> 00:37:29.520 align:start position:0%
good morning honorable members of the
 
00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:31.640 align:start position:0%
criminal justice committee my name is
 
00:37:33.910 --> 00:37:33.920 align:start position:0%
Jonathan Stone I reside in clam New
 
00:37:36.710 --> 00:37:36.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I have a business of Black Op
 
00:37:38.309 --> 00:37:38.319 align:start position:0%
arms where I'm a partner and currently
 
00:37:40.510 --> 00:37:40.520 align:start position:0%
serve as the operations manager and NFA
 
00:37:43.589 --> 00:37:43.599 align:start position:0%
compliance officer I'm here to uh rise
 
00:37:45.950 --> 00:37:45.960 align:start position:0%
in opposition of this bill and also to
 
00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:47.200 align:start position:0%
maybe answer any questions you might
 
00:37:48.470 --> 00:37:48.480 align:start position:0%
have on the actual realities of
 
00:37:49.589 --> 00:37:49.599 align:start position:0%
background tricks in the state of New
 
00:37:52.030 --> 00:37:52.040 align:start position:0%
Hampshire perform on a daily basis uh we
 
00:37:54.150 --> 00:37:54.160 align:start position:0%
have to differentiate excuse me between
 
00:37:55.589 --> 00:37:55.599 align:start position:0%
the state background checks that are
 
00:37:56.990 --> 00:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
done on handgun purchases and what's
 
00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:57.960 align:start position:0%
called an
 
00:37:59.870 --> 00:37:59.880 align:start position:0%
in addition we also do the Nyx checks
 
00:38:02.750 --> 00:38:02.760 align:start position:0%
that are done by the FBI with long guns
 
00:38:05.910 --> 00:38:05.920 align:start position:0%
and uh waiting periods in my opinion are
 
00:38:08.109 --> 00:38:08.119 align:start position:0%
very unnecessary uh burden for many
 
00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:09.760 align:start position:0%
people and for many reasons does not
 
00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:11.000 align:start position:0%
improve the quality of the background
 
00:38:14.069 --> 00:38:14.079 align:start position:0%
check uh I do have the experience over
 
00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:15.920 align:start position:0%
the last 13 years of having women coming
 
00:38:18.109 --> 00:38:18.119 align:start position:0%
in seeking out either Firearms a
 
00:38:19.470 --> 00:38:19.480 align:start position:0%
combination of firearms and non-lethal
 
00:38:22.030 --> 00:38:22.040 align:start position:0%
weapons such as tasers and pepper spray
 
00:38:24.390 --> 00:38:24.400 align:start position:0%
to hinder anyone's ability to P to
 
00:38:27.910 --> 00:38:27.920 align:start position:0%
purchase firearm is really unacceptable
 
00:38:29.470 --> 00:38:29.480 align:start position:0%
uh New Hampshire does not really have a
 
00:38:31.710 --> 00:38:31.720 align:start position:0%
gun problem uh we have very low gun
 
00:38:34.550 --> 00:38:34.560 align:start position:0%
crime we have very low uh rates of
 
00:38:36.230 --> 00:38:36.240 align:start position:0%
suicide when it comes to guns when
 
00:38:38.470 --> 00:38:38.480 align:start position:0%
compared to narcotics such as fentanyl
 
00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:42.520 align:start position:0%
in addition uh you see a lot of people
 
00:38:44.390 --> 00:38:44.400 align:start position:0%
in a gun culture of New Hampshire that
 
00:38:46.349 --> 00:38:46.359 align:start position:0%
are responsible citizens they are not
 
00:38:48.349 --> 00:38:48.359 align:start position:0%
going out committing crimes
 
00:38:49.670 --> 00:38:49.680 align:start position:0%
unfortunately most of the guns that are
 
00:38:51.470 --> 00:38:51.480 align:start position:0%
stolen or traded end up in the state of
 
00:38:52.870 --> 00:38:52.880 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts which is a well-known
 
00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.480 align:start position:0%
document in fact with most of law
 
00:38:56.589 --> 00:38:56.599 align:start position:0%
enforcement and I see this bill is
 
00:38:58.150 --> 00:38:58.160 align:start position:0%
pretty much the same as as it was last
 
00:39:00.349 --> 00:39:00.359 align:start position:0%
year and I often ask myself if anyone
 
00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
from law enforcement comes in to testify
 
00:39:04.349 --> 00:39:04.359 align:start position:0%
in support this of this bill or even
 
00:39:05.710 --> 00:39:05.720 align:start position:0%
requested this bill from the prime
 
00:39:07.750 --> 00:39:07.760 align:start position:0%
sponsor I would eventually that would be
 
00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:09.839 align:start position:0%
a no uh if you have any questions I'm
 
00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:10.920 align:start position:0%
willing to take them but I would
 
00:39:13.230 --> 00:39:13.240 align:start position:0%
recommend itl this bill
 
00:39:15.670 --> 00:39:15.680 align:start position:0%
immediately thank you for your testimony
 
00:39:22.710 --> 00:39:22.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:45.910 --> 00:39:45.920 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:48.349 --> 00:39:48.359 align:start position:0%
do I have to push a button is this it's
 
00:39:51.790 --> 00:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
good okay thank you um well I'm here to
 
00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:53.680 align:start position:0%
explain why a waiting period would have
 
00:39:56.829 --> 00:39:56.839 align:start position:0%
saved my son Nathan and I'm sorry I
 
00:39:59.870 --> 00:39:59.880 align:start position:0%
might go over 3 minutes recently I
 
00:40:01.829 --> 00:40:01.839 align:start position:0%
received two texts from Nate on the same
 
00:40:04.390 --> 00:40:04.400 align:start position:0%
day one was to wish me a happy birthday
 
00:40:07.109 --> 00:40:07.119 align:start position:0%
and the other was to say goodbye and
 
00:40:09.069 --> 00:40:09.079 align:start position:0%
that he loved us and he was sorry then
 
00:40:11.670 --> 00:40:11.680 align:start position:0%
he called 911 to report a suicide at our
 
00:40:14.349 --> 00:40:14.359 align:start position:0%
house he hung up the phone put a gun to
 
00:40:16.790 --> 00:40:16.800 align:start position:0%
his Temple and pulled the trigger the
 
00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:18.760 align:start position:0%
gun he used was purchased legally just a
 
00:40:21.470 --> 00:40:21.480 align:start position:0%
half hour before the hooks at police
 
00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:23.040 align:start position:0%
arrived first and they found that he was
 
00:40:25.270 --> 00:40:25.280 align:start position:0%
still breathing and then an ambulance
 
00:40:26.589 --> 00:40:26.599 align:start position:0%
came and they took him to the Elliot
 
00:40:29.750 --> 00:40:29.760 align:start position:0%
Hospital where he lived another 2 hours
 
00:40:33.270 --> 00:40:33.280 align:start position:0%
in pain when my husband and I arrived we
 
00:40:35.069 --> 00:40:35.079 align:start position:0%
were ushered into the family room of the
 
00:40:38.630 --> 00:40:38.640 align:start position:0%
ER and a moment later they told us um
 
00:40:40.589 --> 00:40:40.599 align:start position:0%
they were moving him to the ICU so we
 
00:40:41.910 --> 00:40:41.920 align:start position:0%
rushed out to see him and there were
 
00:40:44.990 --> 00:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
nurses all around his head like walking
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
alongside the
 
00:40:50.670 --> 00:40:50.680 align:start position:0%
gurnie um I thought oh thank God because
 
00:40:52.589 --> 00:40:52.599 align:start position:0%
they're working on him but really they
 
00:40:56.069 --> 00:40:56.079 align:start position:0%
were just hiding us from seeing him when
 
00:40:58.950 --> 00:40:58.960 align:start position:0%
we reached the ICU a neurologist told us
 
00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:01.440 align:start position:0%
that Nate had no chance of survival
 
00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:03.520 align:start position:0%
there was no significant brain
 
00:41:05.990 --> 00:41:06.000 align:start position:0%
activity keeping him alive was causing
 
00:41:08.790 --> 00:41:08.800 align:start position:0%
his body even more pain even though he
 
00:41:10.870 --> 00:41:10.880 align:start position:0%
had no brain activity the neurologist
 
00:41:14.030 --> 00:41:14.040 align:start position:0%
told us that he was in pain from this
 
00:41:16.550 --> 00:41:16.560 align:start position:0%
gunshot they told us he was going to die
 
00:41:18.510 --> 00:41:18.520 align:start position:0%
and they asked us for permission to just
 
00:41:22.069 --> 00:41:22.079 align:start position:0%
let him go so I asked to be with him and
 
00:41:24.309 --> 00:41:24.319 align:start position:0%
just hold his hand as he died and tell
 
00:41:26.069 --> 00:41:26.079 align:start position:0%
him I loved him and what a great son he
 
00:41:28.910 --> 00:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
was um but they said no because it was
 
00:41:28.920 --> 00:41:29.829 align:start position:0%
was um but they said no because it was
too

00:41:29.829 --> 00:41:29.839 align:start position:0%
too
 
00:41:32.910 --> 00:41:32.920 align:start position:0%
traumatic I said I didn't care but they
 
00:41:36.589 --> 00:41:36.599 align:start position:0%
they said no so he just told me that he
 
00:41:39.030 --> 00:41:39.040 align:start position:0%
lost most of his blood through the wound
 
00:41:42.069 --> 00:41:42.079 align:start position:0%
in his head and they couldn't clean it
 
00:41:44.589 --> 00:41:44.599 align:start position:0%
so my son died
 
00:41:47.630 --> 00:41:47.640 align:start position:0%
Alone um I found out later that the
 
00:41:50.349 --> 00:41:50.359 align:start position:0%
bullet broke his teeth that his eyes
 
00:41:51.990 --> 00:41:52.000 align:start position:0%
were bulging and bleeding from the
 
00:41:54.790 --> 00:41:54.800 align:start position:0%
pressure and there was brain matter and
 
00:41:57.870 --> 00:41:57.880 align:start position:0%
skull pieces around the exit wound
 
00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079 align:start position:0%
that's what they didn't want us to see
 
00:42:02.030 --> 00:42:02.040 align:start position:0%
that's what a gunshot does and I'm
 
00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:04.960 align:start position:0%
telling you this to instill in you that
 
00:42:06.910 --> 00:42:06.920 align:start position:0%
a gunshot is not what you see in the
 
00:42:11.390 --> 00:42:11.400 align:start position:0%
movies Nathan was in pain if he had any
 
00:42:13.510 --> 00:42:13.520 align:start position:0%
idea what he was going to have to go
 
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:16.440 align:start position:0%
through or any idea what we will be
 
00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:18.200 align:start position:0%
going through forever he never would
 
00:42:20.470 --> 00:42:20.480 align:start position:0%
have done this he wouldn't
 
00:42:23.829 --> 00:42:23.839 align:start position:0%
have um if you lined everybody you knew
 
00:42:25.710 --> 00:42:25.720 align:start position:0%
up in order from who would be most
 
00:42:27.390 --> 00:42:27.400 align:start position:0%
likely to kill themselves to Le most
 
00:42:29.670 --> 00:42:29.680 align:start position:0%
likely Nate would be at the end of that
 
00:42:32.030 --> 00:42:32.040 align:start position:0%
line he had everything to live for he
 
00:42:34.950 --> 00:42:34.960 align:start position:0%
was a senior at WPI going to be a
 
00:42:36.750 --> 00:42:36.760 align:start position:0%
mechanical engineer he had countless
 
00:42:38.829 --> 00:42:38.839 align:start position:0%
friends a family who loved him I mean
 
00:42:41.630 --> 00:42:41.640 align:start position:0%
you could go on and on but he had
 
00:42:45.710 --> 00:42:45.720 align:start position:0%
everything he he was just very chill but
 
00:42:47.829 --> 00:42:47.839 align:start position:0%
the Catalyst was like it is for many
 
00:42:48.870 --> 00:42:48.880 align:start position:0%
people a
 
00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:51.240 align:start position:0%
breakup the girl he loved broke up with
 
00:42:53.270 --> 00:42:53.280 align:start position:0%
them just days before and he was
 
00:42:55.910 --> 00:42:55.920 align:start position:0%
planning to spend his life with her so
 
00:42:57.710 --> 00:42:57.720 align:start position:0%
he was just not emotionally sure enough
 
00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:00.040 align:start position:0%
to know how to deal with the pain and at
 
00:43:02.870 --> 00:43:02.880 align:start position:0%
that precise moment he felt that the
 
00:43:05.710 --> 00:43:05.720 align:start position:0%
pain would never go away he wasn't in
 
00:43:09.230 --> 00:43:09.240 align:start position:0%
his right mind so to speak our society
 
00:43:11.030 --> 00:43:11.040 align:start position:0%
seems to think that only people who have
 
00:43:13.829 --> 00:43:13.839 align:start position:0%
mental illnesses or use drugs or have
 
00:43:16.510 --> 00:43:16.520 align:start position:0%
this hatred of people who are evil will
 
00:43:18.589 --> 00:43:18.599 align:start position:0%
either kill themselves or kill someone
 
00:43:22.190 --> 00:43:22.200 align:start position:0%
else but that is not true Nate suicide
 
00:43:24.549 --> 00:43:24.559 align:start position:0%
like so many others was spontaneous he
 
00:43:27.270 --> 00:43:27.280 align:start position:0%
was grieving a loss he was hurt and he
 
00:43:29.349 --> 00:43:29.359 align:start position:0%
was young and he didn't know how to work
 
00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:30.520 align:start position:0%
through any of
 
00:43:33.349 --> 00:43:33.359 align:start position:0%
this if he would have chosen any other
 
00:43:35.829 --> 00:43:35.839 align:start position:0%
means to kill himself besides a gun he
 
00:43:38.270 --> 00:43:38.280 align:start position:0%
would be alive remember he was alive for
 
00:43:40.670 --> 00:43:40.680 align:start position:0%
two more hours after shooting himself in
 
00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:41.630 align:start position:0%
two more hours after shooting himself in
the

00:43:41.630 --> 00:43:41.640 align:start position:0%
the
 
00:43:44.829 --> 00:43:44.839 align:start position:0%
brain an emotional loss triggers violent
 
00:43:47.589 --> 00:43:47.599 align:start position:0%
behavior in many of us I mean okay like
 
00:43:49.950 --> 00:43:49.960 align:start position:0%
most of us like many of us have said
 
00:43:53.150 --> 00:43:53.160 align:start position:0%
things that we don't really we regret
 
00:43:55.630 --> 00:43:55.640 align:start position:0%
later not terrible things but we might
 
00:43:58.030 --> 00:43:58.040 align:start position:0%
regret them we might do things that we
 
00:43:59.349 --> 00:43:59.359 align:start position:0%
regret and say oh I wish I didn't do
 
00:44:01.910 --> 00:44:01.920 align:start position:0%
that but I was really upset now this is
 
00:44:04.630 --> 00:44:04.640 align:start position:0%
this bill is for someone who is at the
 
00:44:07.790 --> 00:44:07.800 align:start position:0%
other end they're just too the emotional
 
00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:10.160 align:start position:0%
pain is too much for them to
 
00:44:13.150 --> 00:44:13.160 align:start position:0%
handle um so the idea is to just give
 
00:44:15.950 --> 00:44:15.960 align:start position:0%
people a moment to take a breath before
 
00:44:17.750 --> 00:44:17.760 align:start position:0%
they make any rash
 
00:44:20.950 --> 00:44:20.960 align:start position:0%
decisions now my husband and I are gun
 
00:44:23.589 --> 00:44:23.599 align:start position:0%
owners we have a gun safe so our kids
 
00:44:25.309 --> 00:44:25.319 align:start position:0%
can't get to it and that was not the gun
 
00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:27.599 align:start position:0%
he used he drove 10 minutes away to the
 
00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:29.920 align:start position:0%
local gun shop and he bought a gun in
 
00:44:33.150 --> 00:44:33.160 align:start position:0%
minutes and I do not blame the gun shop
 
00:44:34.470 --> 00:44:34.480 align:start position:0%
they did everything that they were
 
00:44:36.390 --> 00:44:36.400 align:start position:0%
supposed to do they were ethical they
 
00:44:39.950 --> 00:44:39.960 align:start position:0%
were they followed the law he was 21 he
 
00:44:41.790 --> 00:44:41.800 align:start position:0%
came in to buy a gun he didn't have a
 
00:44:44.670 --> 00:44:44.680 align:start position:0%
record and they sold it to him but if
 
00:44:46.790 --> 00:44:46.800 align:start position:0%
the law would have made him wait just a
 
00:44:49.630 --> 00:44:49.640 align:start position:0%
couple of more days even 24 hours he
 
00:44:51.630 --> 00:44:51.640 align:start position:0%
would have been able to make a rational
 
00:44:54.309 --> 00:44:54.319 align:start position:0%
decision on if he wanted to really end
 
00:44:57.349 --> 00:44:57.359 align:start position:0%
his life even if the result would have
 
00:44:59.510 --> 00:44:59.520 align:start position:0%
been the same even if he still would
 
00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:01.720 align:start position:0%
have used that gun to take his life he
 
00:45:03.309 --> 00:45:03.319 align:start position:0%
would have had time to think critically
 
00:45:04.430 --> 00:45:04.440 align:start position:0%
about the
 
00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:06.480 align:start position:0%
consequences applying for a gun but
 
00:45:07.950 --> 00:45:07.960 align:start position:0%
needing to wait would have given him
 
00:45:10.270 --> 00:45:10.280 align:start position:0%
time to think about his decision he had
 
00:45:12.710 --> 00:45:12.720 align:start position:0%
friends coming over that weekend it was
 
00:45:14.670 --> 00:45:14.680 align:start position:0%
my birthday we were going to play games
 
00:45:17.190 --> 00:45:17.200 align:start position:0%
we had Settlers of a Katan all set up
 
00:45:19.670 --> 00:45:19.680 align:start position:0%
but he was alone in the house and he was
 
00:45:21.670 --> 00:45:21.680 align:start position:0%
faced with a crisis and he didn't know
 
00:45:24.150 --> 00:45:24.160 align:start position:0%
how to get through it the easiest thing
 
00:45:26.630 --> 00:45:26.640 align:start position:0%
for him to do was to go to the gun shop
 
00:45:29.030 --> 00:45:29.040 align:start position:0%
buy a G and just end his life ended the
 
00:45:32.589 --> 00:45:32.599 align:start position:0%
pain it was Split Second and I know that
 
00:45:33.870 --> 00:45:33.880 align:start position:0%
the Second Amendment says we have the
 
00:45:36.109 --> 00:45:36.119 align:start position:0%
right to bear arms and I fully support
 
00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:39.079 align:start position:0%
that I also know and support the Ninth
 
00:45:40.670 --> 00:45:40.680 align:start position:0%
Amendment which says that we have
 
00:45:42.430 --> 00:45:42.440 align:start position:0%
additional rights that are not listed
 
00:45:44.349 --> 00:45:44.359 align:start position:0%
and one of those is to be safe and the
 
00:45:47.510 --> 00:45:47.520 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Constitution um provides
 
00:45:50.230 --> 00:45:50.240 align:start position:0%
you with the authority to make sure that
 
00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:52.520 align:start position:0%
our general welfare and our common good
 
00:45:55.589 --> 00:45:55.599 align:start position:0%
is safe so our safety can be balanced
 
00:45:57.829 --> 00:45:57.839 align:start position:0%
with our rights for the common good of
 
00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire
 
00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:01.720 align:start position:0%
citizens I'm asking you to vote in favor
 
00:46:04.950 --> 00:46:04.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill Nate's friends and family
 
00:46:06.589 --> 00:46:06.599 align:start position:0%
and the entire Community suffer every
 
00:46:08.790 --> 00:46:08.800 align:start position:0%
day from the loss of an amazing human
 
00:46:10.549 --> 00:46:10.559 align:start position:0%
because it was just too easy for him to
 
00:46:13.190 --> 00:46:13.200 align:start position:0%
get a gun the world was a better place
 
00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:15.440 align:start position:0%
with him here and I know passing the sun
 
00:46:17.230 --> 00:46:17.240 align:start position:0%
isn't this this bill is going to it's
 
00:46:19.349 --> 00:46:19.359 align:start position:0%
not going to bring my son back but it
 
00:46:22.309 --> 00:46:22.319 align:start position:0%
could save the Sons and Daughters of
 
00:46:24.549 --> 00:46:24.559 align:start position:0%
other New Hampshire citizens so I'm
 
00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:27.280 align:start position:0%
asking you to protect their lives and I
 
00:46:29.510 --> 00:46:29.520 align:start position:0%

mentioned it's about 50% of suicides
 
00:46:40.710 --> 00:46:40.720 align:start position:0%
deaths suicides are by gun deaths it's
 
00:46:44.710 --> 00:46:44.720 align:start position:0%
54.6 4% and in New Hampshire in
 
00:46:50.349 --> 00:46:50.359 align:start position:0%
2022 there was um 247 suicides um or 249
 
00:46:54.190 --> 00:46:54.200 align:start position:0%
suicides and 147 were by guns so I hope

that's
 
00:47:23.950 --> 00:47:23.960 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:27.470 --> 00:47:27.480 align:start position:0%
Hank good morning my name is Dr John
 
00:47:28.910 --> 00:47:28.920 align:start position:0%
henk and I'm representing the New
 
00:47:30.710 --> 00:47:30.720 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Psychiatric
 
00:47:34.710 --> 00:47:34.720 align:start position:0%
Society in support of HB
 
00:47:37.430 --> 00:47:37.440 align:start position:0%
56 I have worked as a psychiatrist at
 
00:47:40.270 --> 00:47:40.280 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire hospital for many years
 
00:47:43.750 --> 00:47:43.760 align:start position:0%
gun violence has become a Public Health
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
crisis and it is
 
00:47:47.829 --> 00:47:47.839 align:start position:0%
preventable the New Hampshire
 
00:47:50.670 --> 00:47:50.680 align:start position:0%
Psychiatric Society advocates for
 
00:47:54.190 --> 00:47:54.200 align:start position:0%
legislation to reduce deaths related to
 
00:47:57.470 --> 00:47:57.480 align:start position:0%
gun violence including background checks
 
00:47:59.549 --> 00:47:59.559 align:start position:0%
and mandatory waiting
 
00:48:02.790 --> 00:48:02.800 align:start position:0%
periods the use of a gun greatly
 
00:48:05.270 --> 00:48:05.280 align:start position:0%
increases the risk that violence to or
 
00:48:07.870 --> 00:48:07.880 align:start position:0%
others will result in a
 
00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:12.280 align:start position:0%
fatality in 2023 in New Hampshire 85% of
 
00:48:14.950 --> 00:48:14.960 align:start position:0%
gun deaths were
 
00:48:18.030 --> 00:48:18.040 align:start position:0%
suicides choosing a gun as a method of
 
00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:20.960 align:start position:0%
suicide makes it much more likely that
 
00:48:23.990 --> 00:48:24.000 align:start position:0%
the individual will die compared to
 
00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:25.349 align:start position:0%
the individual will die compared to
other

00:48:25.349 --> 00:48:25.359 align:start position:0%
other
 
00:48:27.589 --> 00:48:27.599 align:start position:0%
methods so other words when you use
 
00:48:30.750 --> 00:48:30.760 align:start position:0%
another method many times the person
 
00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:33.280 align:start position:0%
actually survives but when you choose a
 
00:48:37.230 --> 00:48:37.240 align:start position:0%
gun as the method the majority will be a
 
00:48:41.430 --> 00:48:41.440 align:start position:0%
fatality um and you know sadly guns are
 
00:48:44.589 --> 00:48:44.599 align:start position:0%
now the leading cause of death for us
 
00:48:48.630 --> 00:48:48.640 align:start position:0%
Children and adolescents as of
 
00:48:51.309 --> 00:48:51.319 align:start position:0%
2020 Studies have shown that background
 
00:48:54.510 --> 00:48:54.520 align:start position:0%
checks can reduce gun violence by
 
00:48:58.069 --> 00:48:58.079 align:start position:0%
prohibiting Firearms to highrisk groups
 
00:49:00.069 --> 00:49:00.079 align:start position:0%
including individuals with mental
 
00:49:02.829 --> 00:49:02.839 align:start position:0%
illness who have been adjudicated with
 
00:49:05.710 --> 00:49:05.720 align:start position:0%
due process to be a threat to themselves
 
00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:07.510 align:start position:0%
due process to be a threat to themselves
or

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:07.520 align:start position:0%
or
 
00:49:10.349 --> 00:49:10.359 align:start position:0%
others Studies have also shown that
 
00:49:13.589 --> 00:49:13.599 align:start position:0%
mandatory waiting periods can reduce gun
 
00:49:15.589 --> 00:49:15.599 align:start position:0%
suicides and
 
00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:18.680 align:start position:0%
homicides by reducing the likelihood of
 
00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.150 align:start position:0%
homicides by reducing the likelihood of
impulsive

00:49:20.150 --> 00:49:20.160 align:start position:0%
impulsive
 
00:49:23.470 --> 00:49:23.480 align:start position:0%
acts lowering the chance a person in
 
00:49:25.270 --> 00:49:25.280 align:start position:0%
crisis of getting a
 
00:49:29.349 --> 00:49:29.359 align:start position:0%
gun sto ing sudden decisions to commit
 
00:49:31.870 --> 00:49:31.880 align:start position:0%
violence to self or
 
00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:35.440 align:start position:0%
others and increasing the chance that
 
00:49:37.710 --> 00:49:37.720 align:start position:0%
the Suicidal Thoughts will actually
 
00:49:40.589 --> 00:49:40.599 align:start position:0%
subside over time and we see this many
 
00:49:43.309 --> 00:49:43.319 align:start position:0%
times in our practice of Psychiatry
 
00:49:46.349 --> 00:49:46.359 align:start position:0%
where someone in the moment is suicidal
 
00:49:49.549 --> 00:49:49.559 align:start position:0%
but with the passage of time they change
 
00:49:52.230 --> 00:49:52.240 align:start position:0%
their minds and that's very
 
00:49:57.870 --> 00:49:57.880 align:start position:0%
common um please vote in favor of HB 56
 
00:50:00.710 --> 00:50:00.720 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time and
 
00:50:02.270 --> 00:50:02.280 align:start position:0%

00:50:24.309 --> 00:50:24.319 align:start position:0%

wow good morning uh thank you for
 
00:50:34.829 --> 00:50:34.839 align:start position:0%
listening to me today my name is Joe
 
00:50:35.910 --> 00:50:35.920 align:start position:0%
Hannah I'm the vice president for
 
00:50:37.750 --> 00:50:37.760 align:start position:0%
Gunners of New Hampshire uh I'm speaking
 
00:50:39.510 --> 00:50:39.520 align:start position:0%
in opposition to this bill probably for
 
00:50:40.789 --> 00:50:40.799 align:start position:0%
about the 12th time since I've been
 
00:50:43.589 --> 00:50:43.599 align:start position:0%
coming here uh this bill is a perennial
 
00:50:46.230 --> 00:50:46.240 align:start position:0%
favorite it seems um this does create an
 
00:50:47.670 --> 00:50:47.680 align:start position:0%
undue burden for people who wish to
 
00:50:51.309 --> 00:50:51.319 align:start position:0%
exercise their rights um you know we
 
00:50:53.030 --> 00:50:53.040 align:start position:0%
don't we've heard the expression a right
 
00:50:54.549 --> 00:50:54.559 align:start position:0%
delayed is a right denied and that's
 
00:50:56.829 --> 00:50:56.839 align:start position:0%
exactly what this is is doing to people
 
00:50:58.549 --> 00:50:58.559 align:start position:0%
there's no different than uh First
 
00:51:00.950 --> 00:51:00.960 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights being U Abridged by
 
00:51:02.910 --> 00:51:02.920 align:start position:0%
delaying permits or allowing people to
 
00:51:05.109 --> 00:51:05.119 align:start position:0%
to exercise their first amendment rights
 
00:51:06.630 --> 00:51:06.640 align:start position:0%
the argument's been used that oh we
 
00:51:08.270 --> 00:51:08.280 align:start position:0%
can't necessarily let people exercise
 
00:51:09.549 --> 00:51:09.559 align:start position:0%
the First Amendment right sometimes
 
00:51:10.990 --> 00:51:11.000 align:start position:0%
because violence may happen we've seen
 
00:51:13.789 --> 00:51:13.799 align:start position:0%
Cities Burn people get killed uh
 
00:51:16.990 --> 00:51:17.000 align:start position:0%
property destroyed Mayhem ensuing uh but
 
00:51:18.390 --> 00:51:18.400 align:start position:0%
we still don't deny People's First
 
00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:19.760 align:start position:0%
Amendment rights because there are Bad
 
00:51:21.510 --> 00:51:21.520 align:start position:0%
actors among them because bad things
 
00:51:23.430 --> 00:51:23.440 align:start position:0%
happen we don't get rid of natural
 
00:51:25.150 --> 00:51:25.160 align:start position:0%
rights that everyone is
 
00:51:28.069 --> 00:51:28.079 align:start position:0%
deserving um
 
00:51:31.390 --> 00:51:31.400 align:start position:0%
by delaying these rights we are
 
00:51:33.349 --> 00:51:33.359 align:start position:0%
increasing dangers to people we've heard
 
00:51:35.750 --> 00:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
people talk about uh domestic violence U
 
00:51:38.430 --> 00:51:38.440 align:start position:0%
AB survivors um people that are in
 
00:51:42.230 --> 00:51:42.240 align:start position:0%
natural disasters people are um you know
 
00:51:44.589 --> 00:51:44.599 align:start position:0%
left alone to defend defend themselves
 
00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:46.079 align:start position:0%
police don't show up I've been in
 
00:51:48.150 --> 00:51:48.160 align:start position:0%
natural disaster areas I've been in U
 
00:51:50.549 --> 00:51:50.559 align:start position:0%
multiple hurricanes and tornado zones
 
00:51:55.390 --> 00:51:55.400 align:start position:0%
flood zones uh and there's a a very very
 
00:51:57.829 --> 00:51:57.839 align:start position:0%
tense period in those those places like
 
00:51:59.230 --> 00:51:59.240 align:start position:0%
people are experiencing LA right now
 
00:52:01.750 --> 00:52:01.760 align:start position:0%
violence is is an AB absolute threat if
 
00:52:03.910 --> 00:52:03.920 align:start position:0%
people don't have um a firearm in these
 
00:52:05.710 --> 00:52:05.720 align:start position:0%
instances they go out and buy them after
 
00:52:07.349 --> 00:52:07.359 align:start position:0%
some of the the incidences in the last
 
00:52:09.349 --> 00:52:09.359 align:start position:0%
few years
 
00:52:11.910 --> 00:52:11.920 align:start position:0%
um background checks have increased by
 
00:52:13.910 --> 00:52:13.920 align:start position:0%
up to 500% over short periods of time
 
00:52:15.430 --> 00:52:15.440 align:start position:0%
after some of these incidents in certain
 
00:52:18.109 --> 00:52:18.119 align:start position:0%
places so people are waking up to the
 
00:52:19.950 --> 00:52:19.960 align:start position:0%
fact that hey I need to protect myself
 
00:52:21.630 --> 00:52:21.640 align:start position:0%
but when they get there the number one
 
00:52:23.829 --> 00:52:23.839 align:start position:0%
thing they experience is well you have
 
00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:26.720 align:start position:0%
to wait this long in this state or you
 
00:52:27.750 --> 00:52:27.760 align:start position:0%
have to wait till the background check's
 
00:52:28.950 --> 00:52:28.960 align:start position:0%
on some people don't even like waiting
 
00:52:30.950 --> 00:52:30.960 align:start position:0%
for the the actual instant background
 
00:52:33.309 --> 00:52:33.319 align:start position:0%
check which you know can't do much about
 
00:52:35.589 --> 00:52:35.599 align:start position:0%
that but if you have to wait longer to
 
00:52:37.030 --> 00:52:37.040 align:start position:0%
get your property we don't do that for
 
00:52:38.910 --> 00:52:38.920 align:start position:0%
just about anything else you can get
 
00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:41.000 align:start position:0%
your you know narcotic prescriptions
 
00:52:41.990 --> 00:52:42.000 align:start position:0%
right away as soon as you get your
 
00:52:43.910 --> 00:52:43.920 align:start position:0%
prescription filled you can buy your
 
00:52:45.789 --> 00:52:45.799 align:start position:0%
pressure cookers all kinds of stuff that
 
00:52:48.470 --> 00:52:48.480 align:start position:0%
could cause major problems no one's
 
00:52:51.150 --> 00:52:51.160 align:start position:0%
doing this
 
00:52:59.230 --> 00:52:59.240 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:01.190 --> 00:53:01.200 align:start position:0%
uh Madison the person who actually wrote
 
00:53:03.230 --> 00:53:03.240 align:start position:0%
wrote a lot of this um in in the
 
00:53:06.589 --> 00:53:06.599 align:start position:0%
Constitution said that property um he
 
00:53:08.950 --> 00:53:08.960 align:start position:0%
has a property very dear to him in the
 
00:53:11.710 --> 00:53:11.720 align:start position:0%
safety and Liberty of his person so
 
00:53:13.510 --> 00:53:13.520 align:start position:0%
property rights aren't just about
 
00:53:14.910 --> 00:53:14.920 align:start position:0%
tangible things that we own they're
 
00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:17.000 align:start position:0%
about our own individual selves and what
 
00:53:18.710 --> 00:53:18.720 align:start position:0%
we have a right to do we have a right to
 
00:53:19.870 --> 00:53:19.880 align:start position:0%
defend ourselves we have a right to
 
00:53:19.880 --> 00:53:21.030 align:start position:0%
defend ourselves we have a right to
protect

00:53:21.030 --> 00:53:21.040 align:start position:0%
protect
 
00:53:24.270 --> 00:53:24.280 align:start position:0%
ourselves and increasing the time to
 
00:53:26.589 --> 00:53:26.599 align:start position:0%
allow that to happen is an inherent
 
00:53:28.470 --> 00:53:28.480 align:start position:0%
violation our natural rights that's not
 
00:53:29.789 --> 00:53:29.799 align:start position:0%
just against the Second Amendment it's a
 
00:53:32.470 --> 00:53:32.480 align:start position:0%
First Amendment issue and it's a it's a
 
00:53:34.670 --> 00:53:34.680 align:start position:0%
property rights issue so I I beg you to
 
00:53:37.789 --> 00:53:37.799 align:start position:0%
please um itl this bill and I'd be happy
 
00:53:40.470 --> 00:53:40.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:42.549 --> 00:53:42.559 align:start position:0%

00:53:49.950 --> 00:53:49.960 align:start position:0%
bill the chair calls representative s
 
00:53:49.960 --> 00:53:57.309 align:start position:0%

ORS

00:53:57.309 --> 00:53:57.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:59.829 --> 00:53:59.839 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Excuse me chairman and
 
00:54:04.430 --> 00:54:04.440 align:start position:0%
committee so uh I had the lady Liv not
 
00:54:06.750 --> 00:54:06.760 align:start position:0%
too far from me when I used to uh work
 
00:54:09.549 --> 00:54:09.559 align:start position:0%
in New Jersey I was working in Manhattan
 
00:54:12.510 --> 00:54:12.520 align:start position:0%
and her right to a firearm was delayed
 
00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:13.760 align:start position:0%
she was being
 
00:54:16.750 --> 00:54:16.760 align:start position:0%
stalked and through repeated requests
 
00:54:19.109 --> 00:54:19.119 align:start position:0%
she was continually denied and
 
00:54:21.430 --> 00:54:21.440 align:start position:0%
eventually her stalker and ex-boyfriend
 
00:54:25.630 --> 00:54:25.640 align:start position:0%
did kill her as it's already been said
 
00:54:29.470 --> 00:54:29.480 align:start position:0%
these laws that delay Firearms to
 
00:54:33.430 --> 00:54:33.440 align:start position:0%
law-abiding citizens have no effect on
 
00:54:37.710 --> 00:54:37.720 align:start position:0%
those that want to commit harm in the UK
 
00:54:40.150 --> 00:54:40.160 align:start position:0%
when they banned firearms and they kept
 
00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720 align:start position:0%
Banning Firearms people used kitchen
 
00:54:45.710 --> 00:54:45.720 align:start position:0%
knives baseball bats whatever was
 
00:54:49.230 --> 00:54:49.240 align:start position:0%
available so we need to realize that
 
00:54:53.030 --> 00:54:53.040 align:start position:0%
currently there are 32,000 laws on the
 
00:54:56.789 --> 00:54:56.799 align:start position:0%
books and these laws do not stop those
 
00:54:58.470 --> 00:54:58.480 align:start position:0%
that want to do
 
00:55:01.789 --> 00:55:01.799 align:start position:0%
harm uh they'll run you over with a car
 
00:55:05.670 --> 00:55:05.680 align:start position:0%
more victims are the result of a hammer
 
00:55:09.829 --> 00:55:09.839 align:start position:0%
in this country than with Firearms we
 
00:55:13.190 --> 00:55:13.200 align:start position:0%
have all these laws they do no good ice
 
00:55:16.150 --> 00:55:16.160 align:start position:0%

00:58:32.910 --> 00:58:32.920 align:start position:0%
tragedy
 
00:58:32.920 --> 00:58:35.309 align:start position:0%
tragedy
and

00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:35.319 align:start position:0%
and
 
00:58:38.150 --> 00:58:38.160 align:start position:0%
having Universal background checks would
 
00:58:40.630 --> 00:58:40.640 align:start position:0%
not have helped that at all you look at
 
00:58:44.150 --> 00:58:44.160 align:start position:0%
most cases where criminals use a gun
 
00:58:45.710 --> 00:58:45.720 align:start position:0%
you're going to find that they didn't
 
00:58:48.069 --> 00:58:48.079 align:start position:0%
get it through a background check
 
00:58:51.549 --> 00:58:51.559 align:start position:0%
somewhere and having or have a waiting
 
00:58:53.950 --> 00:58:53.960 align:start position:0%
period for most people this this the
 
00:58:55.670 --> 00:58:55.680 align:start position:0%
waiting periods IR relevant if I wanted
 
00:58:57.390 --> 00:58:57.400 align:start position:0%
to buy one it wouldn't bother me too
 
00:58:59.150 --> 00:58:59.160 align:start position:0%
much to wait a couple days because I've
 
00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:02.440 align:start position:0%
got two or three guns already
 
00:59:05.430 --> 00:59:05.440 align:start position:0%
but and criminals they don't care if
 
00:59:06.750 --> 00:59:06.760 align:start position:0%
there's a background check they're not
 
00:59:07.990 --> 00:59:08.000 align:start position:0%
going to they're not going to worry
 
00:59:10.069 --> 00:59:10.079 align:start position:0%
about it my
 
00:59:13.910 --> 00:59:13.920 align:start position:0%
nephew bless his soul had
 
00:59:16.670 --> 00:59:16.680 align:start position:0%
um he tried driving his car into a
 
00:59:19.109 --> 00:59:19.119 align:start position:0%
bridge AB butman didn't die my sister
 
00:59:21.670 --> 00:59:21.680 align:start position:0%
had to coax him back to
 
00:59:24.510 --> 00:59:24.520 align:start position:0%
healthy he jumped through their storm
 
00:59:27.109 --> 00:59:27.119 align:start position:0%
door to try and kill himself
 
00:59:29.829 --> 00:59:29.839 align:start position:0%
didn't didn't die she had to coax him
 
00:59:33.069 --> 00:59:33.079 align:start position:0%
back to being healthy he finally got his
 
00:59:37.630 --> 00:59:37.640 align:start position:0%
hands on some fenal and he died he never
 
00:59:39.990 --> 00:59:40.000 align:start position:0%
people die people try to commit suicide
 
00:59:42.069 --> 00:59:42.079 align:start position:0%
they don't always try to use a gun
 
00:59:44.109 --> 00:59:44.119 align:start position:0%
they'd usually find a way if they're
 
00:59:45.670 --> 00:59:45.680 align:start position:0%
serious about
 
00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:49.280 align:start position:0%
it so waiting periods don't really
 
00:59:53.589 --> 00:59:53.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:59:56.270 --> 00:59:56.280 align:start position:0%
sir yeah
 
00:59:57.680 --> 00:59:57.690 align:start position:0%
chair call J
 
00:59:57.690 --> 01:00:02.630 align:start position:0%
chair call J
[Music]

01:00:02.630 --> 01:00:02.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:20.960 align:start position:0%
 
01:00:23.349 --> 01:00:23.359 align:start position:0%
simin good morning Mr chairman and
 
01:00:26.630 --> 01:00:26.640 align:start position:0%
members of the committee
 
01:00:29.750 --> 01:00:29.760 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for carving out some
 
01:00:31.190 --> 01:00:31.200 align:start position:0%
time for
 
01:00:34.549 --> 01:00:34.559 align:start position:0%
me made it here by the skin of my
 
01:00:38.390 --> 01:00:38.400 align:start position:0%
teeth but sometimes that
 
01:00:42.630 --> 01:00:42.640 align:start position:0%
happens House Bill 56 FN if an acted
 
01:00:45.270 --> 01:00:45.280 align:start position:0%
will actually subvert Public
 
01:00:47.990 --> 01:00:48.000 align:start position:0%
Safety seems to me the backers prefer a
 
01:00:51.309 --> 01:00:51.319 align:start position:0%
high crime state in which case I think
 
01:00:53.990 --> 01:00:54.000 align:start position:0%
they should move to
 
01:00:56.670 --> 01:00:56.680 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts uh what I plan to do is to
 
01:00:59.510 --> 01:00:59.520 align:start position:0%
provide you with some data cuz I wear
 
01:01:01.230 --> 01:01:01.240 align:start position:0%
another hat Beyond being a federal
 
01:01:04.630 --> 01:01:04.640 align:start position:0%
firearms liy I'm an international
 
01:01:04.640 --> 01:01:06.470 align:start position:0%
firearms liy I'm an international
economic

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:06.480 align:start position:0%
economic
 
01:01:08.870 --> 01:01:08.880 align:start position:0%
consultant so data have
 
01:01:11.549 --> 01:01:11.559 align:start position:0%
meaning since
 
01:01:15.670 --> 01:01:15.680 align:start position:0%
1985 the incidence of vion crime in
 
01:01:19.390 --> 01:01:19.400 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts has at least been 1.8
 
01:01:22.270 --> 01:01:22.280 align:start position:0%
times that of New
 
01:01:26.430 --> 01:01:26.440 align:start position:0%
Hampshire that to me is significant at
 
01:01:31.630 --> 01:01:31.640 align:start position:0%
no time over this nearly 40-year period
 
01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:33.880 align:start position:0%
has the incidence of violent crime in
 
01:01:37.430 --> 01:01:37.440 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire exceeded that in
 
01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:39.760 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts so the conclusion that I
 
01:01:42.870 --> 01:01:42.880 align:start position:0%
reach is that whatever we do and
 
01:01:44.950 --> 01:01:44.960 align:start position:0%
whatever you and your predecessors have
 
01:01:48.750 --> 01:01:48.760 align:start position:0%
done in the realm of Public Safety seems
 
01:01:53.269 --> 01:01:53.279 align:start position:0%
to work and therefore House Bill 56 FN
 
01:01:56.029 --> 01:01:56.039 align:start position:0%
in any variants should be voted in
 
01:01:58.190 --> 01:01:58.200 align:start position:0%
expedient to
 
01:02:00.990 --> 01:02:01.000 align:start position:0%
legislate some foundational
 
01:02:03.190 --> 01:02:03.200 align:start position:0%
facts at end
 
01:02:07.069 --> 01:02:07.079 align:start position:0%
2023 there were some 512 million
 
01:02:10.470 --> 01:02:10.480 align:start position:0%
firearms in the United States I set
 
01:02:13.710 --> 01:02:13.720 align:start position:0%
forth in my written testimony copies of
 
01:02:16.309 --> 01:02:16.319 align:start position:0%
which I will of course provide the data
 
01:02:18.510 --> 01:02:18.520 align:start position:0%
sources what's included and what's
 
01:02:21.309 --> 01:02:21.319 align:start position:0%
excluded so the number could be 500
 
01:02:26.069 --> 01:02:26.079 align:start position:0%
million or 495 it might be 525 but it's
 
01:02:29.069 --> 01:02:29.079 align:start position:0%
close to half a billion Firearms key
 
01:02:33.309 --> 01:02:33.319 align:start position:0%
Point anything so abundant and mainly
 
01:02:36.269 --> 01:02:36.279 align:start position:0%
concealable cannot be controlled it's
 
01:02:36.279 --> 01:02:38.069 align:start position:0%
concealable cannot be controlled it's
for

01:02:38.069 --> 01:02:38.079 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:02:40.150 --> 01:02:40.160 align:start position:0%
doomed and what I say cannot be
 
01:02:43.109 --> 01:02:43.119 align:start position:0%
controlled without police state measures
 
01:02:45.190 --> 01:02:45.200 align:start position:0%
because there are many countries where
 
01:02:49.470 --> 01:02:49.480 align:start position:0%
police state measures are in force and
 
01:02:53.470 --> 01:02:53.480 align:start position:0%
the Civil population doesn't have
 
01:02:58.829 --> 01:02:58.839 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:03.029 --> 01:03:03.039 align:start position:0%
fact the Bill's backers seem to presume
 
01:03:06.549 --> 01:03:06.559 align:start position:0%
that gun control underpins Public Safety
 
01:03:08.589 --> 01:03:08.599 align:start position:0%
this is simply not
 
01:03:11.069 --> 01:03:11.079 align:start position:0%
so at least
 
01:03:11.079 --> 01:03:13.630 align:start position:0%
so at least
since

01:03:13.630 --> 01:03:13.640 align:start position:0%
since
 
01:03:17.430 --> 01:03:17.440 align:start position:0%
2001 Maine New Hampshire and
 
01:03:20.069 --> 01:03:20.079 align:start position:0%
Vermont which for almost all of this
 
01:03:22.910 --> 01:03:22.920 align:start position:0%
period had very few laws relating to
 
01:03:26.470 --> 01:03:26.480 align:start position:0%
Firearms were the three safest States in
 
01:03:31.150 --> 01:03:31.160 align:start position:0%
this Union safest states is measured by
 
01:03:34.069 --> 01:03:34.079 align:start position:0%
the incidence of violent crime per
 
01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:37.240 align:start position:0%
100,000 residents so it adjusts for the
 
01:03:39.069 --> 01:03:39.079 align:start position:0%
differences in
 
01:03:39.079 --> 01:03:42.630 align:start position:0%
differences in
population

01:03:42.630 --> 01:03:42.640 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:47.269 --> 01:03:47.279 align:start position:0%
pardon okay I will make just one more
 
01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:49.160 align:start position:0%
quick point if I may Mr
 
01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:53.319 align:start position:0%
chairman very quick in The Wider world
 
01:03:55.870 --> 01:03:55.880 align:start position:0%
the downside to gun control isn't
 
01:03:58.789 --> 01:03:58.799 align:start position:0%
fairness to firearm owners it is
 
01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:01.839 align:start position:0%
genocide you simply cannot murder
 
01:04:05.029 --> 01:04:05.039 align:start position:0%
hundreds of thousands or Millions unless
 
01:04:07.430 --> 01:04:07.440 align:start position:0%
and until the targeted group and their
 
01:04:11.910 --> 01:04:11.920 align:start position:0%
sympathizers are disarmed and thus those
 
01:04:13.309 --> 01:04:13.319 align:start position:0%
who back gun
 
01:04:15.430 --> 01:04:15.440 align:start position:0%
control willing or
 
01:04:18.710 --> 01:04:18.720 align:start position:0%
not promote genocide I'll be happy to
 
01:04:20.950 --> 01:04:20.960 align:start position:0%
take any
 
01:04:23.109 --> 01:04:23.119 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:25.720 align:start position:0%
testimony thank you sir and thank you

committee and with that I close the
 
01:04:32.190 --> 01:04:32.200 align:start position:0%

good morning once again thank you Mr
 
01:09:06.229 --> 01:09:06.239 align:start position:0%
chairman and thank you committee so I'm
 
01:09:09.870 --> 01:09:09.880 align:start position:0%
here to uh introduce House Bill 207 FN
 
01:09:14.349 --> 01:09:14.359 align:start position:0%
for representative James Spain this be
 
01:09:17.229 --> 01:09:17.239 align:start position:0%
uh this bill deals with the uh making
 
01:09:21.510 --> 01:09:21.520 align:start position:0%
legal for persons over the age of 18 and
 
01:09:25.390 --> 01:09:25.400 align:start position:0%
over blackjacks metallic Knuckles slung
 
01:09:28.709 --> 01:09:28.719 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:31.829 --> 01:09:31.839 align:start position:0%
thing one thing I'm sure of uh there's
 
01:09:34.390 --> 01:09:34.400 align:start position:0%
not too many of us that are going to be
 
01:09:36.950 --> 01:09:36.960 align:start position:0%
carrying around slung shots those slung
 
01:09:40.789 --> 01:09:40.799 align:start position:0%
shots are legal in a fishing
 
01:09:43.590 --> 01:09:43.600 align:start position:0%
industry it's it's rather a heavy and
 
01:09:45.669 --> 01:09:45.679 align:start position:0%
cumbersome type
 
01:09:49.630 --> 01:09:49.640 align:start position:0%
of weapon I guess you could call it that
 
01:09:52.590 --> 01:09:52.600 align:start position:0%
uh I could take a scarf which I have
 
01:09:54.390 --> 01:09:54.400 align:start position:0%
hanging in the other room which I needed
 
01:09:56.229 --> 01:09:56.239 align:start position:0%
to wear today it was quite cold out
 
01:09:58.590 --> 01:09:58.600 align:start position:0%
there and I could put a couple rocks in
 
01:10:02.950 --> 01:10:02.960 align:start position:0%
there some used coffee pods that have
 
01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:05.080 align:start position:0%
have wait to them after they've been
 
01:10:08.590 --> 01:10:08.600 align:start position:0%
used and make a slung shot what what
 
01:10:11.590 --> 01:10:11.600 align:start position:0%
this bill really does it's it's a
 
01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:14.920 align:start position:0%
liberty bill it's a bill for those that
 
01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:18.120 align:start position:0%
collect these types of things no one's
 
01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:21.560 align:start position:0%
going to carry around a set of what used
 
01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:23.640 align:start position:0%
to be called brass
 
01:10:28.110 --> 01:10:28.120 align:start position:0%
knuckles or black Jacks without making
 
01:10:31.110 --> 01:10:31.120 align:start position:0%
themselves known now the brass knuckles
 
01:10:33.350 --> 01:10:33.360 align:start position:0%
yes you could hide those in your
 
01:10:36.189 --> 01:10:36.199 align:start position:0%
pocket however we've seen in New York
 
01:10:39.310 --> 01:10:39.320 align:start position:0%
City and a lot of these big cities these
 
01:10:39.320 --> 01:10:41.390 align:start position:0%
City and a lot of these big cities these
knockout

01:10:41.390 --> 01:10:41.400 align:start position:0%
knockout
 
01:10:43.830 --> 01:10:43.840 align:start position:0%
contests where these punks will come up
 
01:10:46.870 --> 01:10:46.880 align:start position:0%
behind somebody carrying a briefcase or
 
01:10:50.149 --> 01:10:50.159 align:start position:0%
whatever and just coldcock them and
 
01:10:51.470 --> 01:10:51.480 align:start position:0%
knock them to the ground they don't need
 
01:10:54.390 --> 01:10:54.400 align:start position:0%
a set of brass knuckles to do that so
 
01:10:57.310 --> 01:10:57.320 align:start position:0%
this again is for Liberty this is for
 
01:11:01.229 --> 01:11:01.239 align:start position:0%
those that collect these types of unique
 
01:11:04.950 --> 01:11:04.960 align:start position:0%
items I have a ceremonial Japanese
 
01:11:09.110 --> 01:11:09.120 align:start position:0%
sword in my basement that was my
 
01:11:11.510 --> 01:11:11.520 align:start position:0%
son's it's not the kind of thing I would
 
01:11:14.910 --> 01:11:14.920 align:start position:0%
carry around but I think we need to look
 
01:11:19.350 --> 01:11:19.360 align:start position:0%
at this as something that is not going
 
01:11:21.990 --> 01:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
to be used for defensive purposes but
 
01:11:24.590 --> 01:11:24.600 align:start position:0%
again it's a collectible I personally
 
01:11:29.390 --> 01:11:29.400 align:start position:0%
would rather carry a firearm a pistol or
 
01:11:32.470 --> 01:11:32.480 align:start position:0%
or a good knife versus any of these
 
01:11:36.709 --> 01:11:36.719 align:start position:0%
things so keep that in mind again this
 
01:11:39.550 --> 01:11:39.560 align:start position:0%
is a novelty thing and I would
 
01:11:41.709 --> 01:11:41.719 align:start position:0%
appreciate your support on this Bill
 
01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:43.679 align:start position:0%
thank you very much I'll take questions
 
01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
if you have
 
01:11:48.229 --> 01:11:48.239 align:start position:0%
them representative
 
01:11:53.669 --> 01:11:53.679 align:start position:0%
Sher uh would you oppose a bill that uh
 
01:11:56.070 --> 01:11:56.080 align:start position:0%
made it a violation or misdemeanor to
 
01:11:58.189 --> 01:11:58.199 align:start position:0%
use any of these
 
01:12:00.709 --> 01:12:00.719 align:start position:0%
items how do you mean
 
01:12:06.629 --> 01:12:06.639 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:09.550 --> 01:12:09.560 align:start position:0%
weapon uh thank you for the question but
 
01:12:10.990 --> 01:12:11.000 align:start position:0%
I still don't understand what you're
 
01:12:12.910 --> 01:12:12.920 align:start position:0%
saying to be used as a weapon you mean
 
01:12:15.950 --> 01:12:15.960 align:start position:0%
aggressively against somebody yes you
 
01:12:17.350 --> 01:12:17.360 align:start position:0%
you've testified that they're just
 
01:12:20.629 --> 01:12:20.639 align:start position:0%
collectible so by by having a ban on
 
01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:23.440 align:start position:0%
using them as a weapon uh it preserves
 
01:12:25.350 --> 01:12:25.360 align:start position:0%
the right of people to collect these
 
01:12:27.189 --> 01:12:27.199 align:start position:0%
things but not to use them well maybe
 
01:12:28.709 --> 01:12:28.719 align:start position:0%
you and I will sit down and try and
 
01:12:32.430 --> 01:12:32.440 align:start position:0%
develop some language on that thank
 
01:12:34.910 --> 01:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
01:12:40.310 --> 01:12:40.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:51.510 --> 01:12:51.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:12:53.629 --> 01:12:53.639 align:start position:0%
Manion thank you Mr chair members of the
 
01:12:55.270 --> 01:12:55.280 align:start position:0%
committee uh for the record my name is
 
01:12:57.030 --> 01:12:57.040 align:start position:0%
Tom Manny I'm representing Hillsboro 1
 
01:13:01.790 --> 01:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
pelum um I rise in support of uh 207 uh
 
01:13:03.750 --> 01:13:03.760 align:start position:0%
I wholeheartedly believe everyone should
 
01:13:05.149 --> 01:13:05.159 align:start position:0%
be armed for
 
01:13:07.189 --> 01:13:07.199 align:start position:0%
self-defense but I understand that not
 
01:13:09.229 --> 01:13:09.239 align:start position:0%
everyone is comfortable carrying a
 
01:13:11.590 --> 01:13:11.600 align:start position:0%
firearm or maybe in a circumstance that
 
01:13:14.709 --> 01:13:14.719 align:start position:0%
prohibits them from doing so as such we
 
01:13:15.910 --> 01:13:15.920 align:start position:0%
should not be standing in the way of
 
01:13:17.310 --> 01:13:17.320 align:start position:0%
these folks to have an effective means
 
01:13:18.990 --> 01:13:19.000 align:start position:0%
to keep themselves
 
01:13:21.590 --> 01:13:21.600 align:start position:0%
safe it has the added benefit of giving
 
01:13:23.709 --> 01:13:23.719 align:start position:0%
a non-lethal alternative to defense from
 
01:13:25.950 --> 01:13:25.960 align:start position:0%
an attacker which is admirable for those
 
01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:28.480 align:start position:0%
that wish to have that option uh with
 
01:13:32.390 --> 01:13:32.400 align:start position:0%
 
01:13:35.110 --> 01:13:35.120 align:start position:0%
hb27 representative
 
01:13:37.270 --> 01:13:37.280 align:start position:0%
Murray thank you Mr chair thank you for
 
01:13:39.149 --> 01:13:39.159 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I'm not sure if
 
01:13:41.669 --> 01:13:41.679 align:start position:0%
you'll know this but last
 
01:13:45.189 --> 01:13:45.199 align:start position:0%
session um we tried we p i mean we
 
01:13:46.990 --> 01:13:47.000 align:start position:0%
passed this to the house a couple times
 
01:13:49.590 --> 01:13:49.600 align:start position:0%
um and I believe the Senate interim
 
01:13:51.669 --> 01:13:51.679 align:start position:0%
studied it this past time do you know if
 
01:13:53.350 --> 01:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
anything came out of that or if anything
 
01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:55.560 align:start position:0%
has changed that would
 
01:13:57.790 --> 01:13:57.800 align:start position:0%
change the outcome in the Senate I'm not
 
01:13:59.430 --> 01:13:59.440 align:start position:0%
sure I mean I can ask my Senator I think
 
01:14:02.470 --> 01:14:02.480 align:start position:0%
he was on that interim study I believe
 
01:14:05.629 --> 01:14:05.639 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you for your
 
01:14:18.510 --> 01:14:18.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:20.870 --> 01:14:20.880 align:start position:0%
Hannah um thank you again I'll make this
 
01:14:22.910 --> 01:14:22.920 align:start position:0%
very brief Joe Hannan um vice president
 
01:14:24.510 --> 01:14:24.520 align:start position:0%
for second vice president for G of New
 
01:14:26.510 --> 01:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
Hampshire uh we stand in favor of this
 
01:14:29.510 --> 01:14:29.520 align:start position:0%
bill uh obviously uh these are not
 
01:14:31.110 --> 01:14:31.120 align:start position:0%
Firearms under the legal definition but
 
01:14:34.149 --> 01:14:34.159 align:start position:0%
they do fall under definition of arms um
 
01:14:36.430 --> 01:14:36.440 align:start position:0%
and that is covered under the Second
 
01:14:36.440 --> 01:14:38.470 align:start position:0%
and that is covered under the Second
Amendment

01:14:38.470 --> 01:14:38.480 align:start position:0%
Amendment
 
01:14:41.149 --> 01:14:41.159 align:start position:0%
um as far as slung shots uh we heard it
 
01:14:43.510 --> 01:14:43.520 align:start position:0%
was a maritime Tool uh it's like we're
 
01:14:45.470 --> 01:14:45.480 align:start position:0%
you know it typically they would use a
 
01:14:47.470 --> 01:14:47.480 align:start position:0%
you know knotted what they call a monkey
 
01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:49.080 align:start position:0%
fist or a little knotted ball around a
 
01:14:52.110 --> 01:14:52.120 align:start position:0%
piece of metal or um some other kind of
 
01:14:53.870 --> 01:14:53.880 align:start position:0%
hard object and that'll be used to throw
 
01:14:57.189 --> 01:14:57.199 align:start position:0%
lines um in Wars they would use similar
 
01:14:59.149 --> 01:14:59.159 align:start position:0%
items for for combat like a mace with a
 
01:15:01.709 --> 01:15:01.719 align:start position:0%
chain something in the end of the ball U
 
01:15:04.229 --> 01:15:04.239 align:start position:0%
but someone could use a rock in a sock
 
01:15:06.149 --> 01:15:06.159 align:start position:0%
if you had and I've seen people use that
 
01:15:07.430 --> 01:15:07.440 align:start position:0%
and in different doing different
 
01:15:08.830 --> 01:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
Outreach with homeless individuals and
 
01:15:10.510 --> 01:15:10.520 align:start position:0%
things like that people will just put
 
01:15:11.750 --> 01:15:11.760 align:start position:0%
something you heard you could just stick
 
01:15:13.669 --> 01:15:13.679 align:start position:0%
anything a roll of quarters in a in a
 
01:15:15.790 --> 01:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
sock or a in a T-shirt and that can be
 
01:15:18.149 --> 01:15:18.159 align:start position:0%
used as a weapon uh we're Banning some
 
01:15:19.550 --> 01:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
we're trying to we have something banned
 
01:15:21.669 --> 01:15:21.679 align:start position:0%
that is you know I could make with
 
01:15:23.189 --> 01:15:23.199 align:start position:0%
probably a dozen things in this room
 
01:15:27.149 --> 01:15:27.159 align:start position:0%
very easily in about 10 seconds um so I
 
01:15:28.629 --> 01:15:28.639 align:start position:0%
think it's very important that we uh do
 
01:15:31.350 --> 01:15:31.360 align:start position:0%
pass this legislation and um repeal
 
01:15:33.070 --> 01:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
something that really doesn't need to be
 
01:15:34.629 --> 01:15:34.639 align:start position:0%
in the law whatsoever be happy to take
 
01:15:34.639 --> 01:15:37.870 align:start position:0%
in the law whatsoever be happy to take
any

01:15:37.870 --> 01:15:37.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:15:41.149 --> 01:15:41.159 align:start position:0%
questions represent
 
01:15:43.629 --> 01:15:43.639 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you for taking my question Dr
 
01:15:48.390 --> 01:15:48.400 align:start position:0%
Hannon as a uh as a medical doctor um
 
01:15:50.310 --> 01:15:50.320 align:start position:0%
can you give your opinion about the
 
01:15:53.350 --> 01:15:53.360 align:start position:0%
difference between a blow struck to
 
01:15:55.550 --> 01:15:55.560 align:start position:0%
someone's face with a fist
 
01:15:58.510 --> 01:15:58.520 align:start position:0%
versus a blow struck to someone's face
 
01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:01.320 align:start position:0%
with a slungshot breast Knuckles or a
 
01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:03.520 align:start position:0%
blackjack well I was a foot and ankle
 
01:16:06.030 --> 01:16:06.040 align:start position:0%
surgeon so I'll limit my answer to below
 
01:16:09.669 --> 01:16:09.679 align:start position:0%
the knee uh I've treated gunshot wounds
 
01:16:12.030 --> 01:16:12.040 align:start position:0%
I've treated people that have been you
 
01:16:14.189 --> 01:16:14.199 align:start position:0%
know run over with lawnmowers been
 
01:16:16.510 --> 01:16:16.520 align:start position:0%
thrown into campfires been physically
 
01:16:19.149 --> 01:16:19.159 align:start position:0%
abused burned um I haven't seen anyone
 
01:16:20.350 --> 01:16:20.360 align:start position:0%
hitting the foot or knee with a brass
 
01:16:22.550 --> 01:16:22.560 align:start position:0%
knuckle and I couldn't do a
 
01:16:24.990 --> 01:16:25.000 align:start position:0%
comparison I imagine it could be worse
 
01:16:27.030 --> 01:16:27.040 align:start position:0%
but I could hit someone with a rock I I
 
01:16:29.870 --> 01:16:29.880 align:start position:0%
think we all you know know that it's not
 
01:16:31.830 --> 01:16:31.840 align:start position:0%
hard to hit someone with a hard object
 
01:16:34.629 --> 01:16:34.639 align:start position:0%
so it's it's a very arbitrary and you
 
01:16:36.550 --> 01:16:36.560 align:start position:0%
know uh if you look at the history of
 
01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:38.840 align:start position:0%
the law it actually is it's a lot of U
 
01:16:42.629 --> 01:16:42.639 align:start position:0%
you know U I would say
 
01:16:45.110 --> 01:16:45.120 align:start position:0%
uh racist backgrounds I mean they would
 
01:16:47.149 --> 01:16:47.159 align:start position:0%
go to certain minority groups and say
 
01:16:48.350 --> 01:16:48.360 align:start position:0%
you they're doing this and we're going
 
01:16:50.669 --> 01:16:50.679 align:start position:0%
to ban that as a as a whole they had uh
 
01:16:52.070 --> 01:16:52.080 align:start position:0%
Saturday night specials were a ban on
 
01:16:53.550 --> 01:16:53.560 align:start position:0%
firearms for the longest time because
 
01:16:54.990 --> 01:16:55.000 align:start position:0%
that was what people realized that
 
01:16:57.830 --> 01:16:57.840 align:start position:0%
people in poor communities were using uh
 
01:16:59.350 --> 01:16:59.360 align:start position:0%
and they wanted to ban them so they just
 
01:17:00.790 --> 01:17:00.800 align:start position:0%
banned Saturday Night Special so they're
 
01:17:03.910 --> 01:17:03.920 align:start position:0%
trying to ban something that um they
 
01:17:06.030 --> 01:17:06.040 align:start position:0%
they they thought they can control
 
01:17:08.390 --> 01:17:08.400 align:start position:0%
certain populations with and I I don't
 
01:17:09.990 --> 01:17:10.000 align:start position:0%
think that slung shots why everyone's
 
01:17:11.390 --> 01:17:11.400 align:start position:0%
kind of confused why is slung shots in
 
01:17:12.669 --> 01:17:12.679 align:start position:0%
there it's something that the working
 
01:17:14.550 --> 01:17:14.560 align:start position:0%
Dock Workers poor fishermen that was
 
01:17:16.830 --> 01:17:16.840 align:start position:0%
something that very poor working class
 
01:17:18.470 --> 01:17:18.480 align:start position:0%
or workingclass people would use as
 
01:17:20.350 --> 01:17:20.360 align:start position:0%
something that would just you know kind
 
01:17:21.430 --> 01:17:21.440 align:start position:0%
of the equivalent of walking with your
 
01:17:23.110 --> 01:17:23.120 align:start position:0%
car keys to your car you know should we
 
01:17:25.430 --> 01:17:25.440 align:start position:0%
ban that it's what's readily a ailable
 
01:17:27.629 --> 01:17:27.639 align:start position:0%
and I think Banning brass knuckles is no
 
01:17:29.950 --> 01:17:29.960 align:start position:0%
dumber than Banning someone walking to
 
01:17:31.430 --> 01:17:31.440 align:start position:0%
their car with car keys in their fist
 
01:17:31.440 --> 01:17:32.229 align:start position:0%

including intimidation by armed
 
02:00:52.149 --> 02:00:52.159 align:start position:0%
civilians has long been a tool that some
 
02:00:54.069 --> 02:00:54.079 align:start position:0%
people have used to prevent full

participation in US
 
02:00:57.950 --> 02:00:57.960 align:start position:0%
democracy during and after
 
02:01:00.310 --> 02:01:00.320 align:start position:0%
reconstruction guns were often used to
 
02:01:02.310 --> 02:01:02.320 align:start position:0%
scare black voters away from the
 
02:01:05.669 --> 02:01:05.679 align:start position:0%
polls that history of armed voter intim
 
02:01:08.669 --> 02:01:08.679 align:start position:0%
intimidation is not a distance memory in
 
02:01:11.709 --> 02:01:11.719 align:start position:0%
this country guns at the poles are a

Dropbox Behavior like this not only puts
 
02:01:48.870 --> 02:01:48.880 align:start position:0%
voters and election workers at risk it
 
02:01:52.510 --> 02:01:52.520 align:start position:0%
also puts democracy itself at risk
 
02:01:55.270 --> 02:01:55.280 align:start position:0%
HB 352 is a proactive attempt to make
 
02:01:58.069 --> 02:01:58.079 align:start position:0%
our election safer for all of our
 
02:02:00.149 --> 02:02:00.159 align:start position:0%
citizens this bill would prohibit
 
02:02:02.589 --> 02:02:02.599 align:start position:0%
carrying a deadly weapon either out in
 
02:02:05.470 --> 02:02:05.480 align:start position:0%
the open or concealed within 100 ft of a
 
02:02:07.990 --> 02:02:08.000 align:start position:0%

02:02:11.510 --> 02:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
state or Municipal elections are taking
 
02:02:14.350 --> 02:02:14.360 align:start position:0%
place 21 states in the District of
 
02:02:17.510 --> 02:02:17.520 align:start position:0%
Columbia already explicitly prohibit
 
02:02:20.750 --> 02:02:20.760 align:start position:0%
guns at polling places in some way but
 
02:02:23.310 --> 02:02:23.320 align:start position:0%
unfortunately New Hampshire does not
 
02:02:25.109 --> 02:02:25.119 align:start position:0%
under our current law state and local
 
02:02:26.870 --> 02:02:26.880 align:start position:0%
authorities can't prevent people from
 
02:02:29.430 --> 02:02:29.440 align:start position:0%
bringing guns into polling places even
 
02:02:32.470 --> 02:02:32.480 align:start position:0%
those located inside school buildings as
 
02:02:34.990 --> 02:02:35.000 align:start position:0%
an open carry state New Hampshire allows
 
02:02:37.229 --> 02:02:37.239 align:start position:0%
gun owners to openly carry a loaded
 
02:02:39.550 --> 02:02:39.560 align:start position:0%
firearm on public property without a
 
02:02:42.910 --> 02:02:42.920 align:start position:0%
license or a permit since 2017 the state
 
02:02:45.390 --> 02:02:45.400 align:start position:0%
has also allowed any lawful gun owner to
 
02:02:47.709 --> 02:02:47.719 align:start position:0%
carry a concealed weapon without a
 
02:02:50.870 --> 02:02:50.880 align:start position:0%
license with HP 352 we do have the power
 
02:02:52.510 --> 02:02:52.520 align:start position:0%
to fix this and we have the
 
02:02:55.510 --> 02:02:55.520 align:start position:0%
Constitutional authority to do so the
 
02:02:57.109 --> 02:02:57.119 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court of the United States said
 
02:02:58.830 --> 02:02:58.840 align:start position:0%
it best when they reasoned in Westbury
 
02:03:01.870 --> 02:03:01.880 align:start position:0%
versus Sanders that quote no right is
 
02:03:03.510 --> 02:03:03.520 align:start position:0%
more precious in a free country than
 
02:03:05.750 --> 02:03:05.760 align:start position:0%
that of having a voice in the election
 
02:03:07.910 --> 02:03:07.920 align:start position:0%
of those who make the laws under which
 
02:03:10.510 --> 02:03:10.520 align:start position:0%
as good citizens we must live other
 
02:03:13.629 --> 02:03:13.639 align:start position:0%
rights even the most basic are elusory
 
02:03:16.229 --> 02:03:16.239 align:start position:0%
if the right to vote is
 
02:03:18.229 --> 02:03:18.239 align:start position:0%
undermined however the fundamental right
 
02:03:20.310 --> 02:03:20.320 align:start position:0%
to vote without fear of intimidation
 
02:03:22.990 --> 02:03:23.000 align:start position:0%
vital to our democracy is endangered
 
02:03:24.910 --> 02:03:24.920 align:start position:0%
when we allow deadly weapons to be
 
02:03:27.470 --> 02:03:27.480 align:start position:0%
displayed as an implied threat to others
 
02:03:30.229 --> 02:03:30.239 align:start position:0%
either inside or outside our polling
 
02:03:32.990 --> 02:03:33.000 align:start position:0%
places in the heler decision Justice
 
02:03:34.709 --> 02:03:34.719 align:start position:0%
Antonin Scalia wrote that while the
 
02:03:36.270 --> 02:03:36.280 align:start position:0%
second amendment protects the right of
 
02:03:38.709 --> 02:03:38.719 align:start position:0%
Law and abiding responsible citizens to
 
02:03:41.750 --> 02:03:41.760 align:start position:0%
use arms in defense of Hearth and Home
 
02:03:43.629 --> 02:03:43.639 align:start position:0%
he also wrote that nothing in our
 
02:03:45.950 --> 02:03:45.960 align:start position:0%
opinion should be taken to cast doubt on
 
02:03:48.390 --> 02:03:48.400 align:start position:0%
long-standing prohibitions on laws
 
02:03:50.430 --> 02:03:50.440 align:start position:0%
forbidding the carrying of firearms in
 
02:03:52.790 --> 02:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
sensitive places such as Schools and
 
02:03:55.270 --> 02:03:55.280 align:start position:0%
Government buildings several States
 
02:03:56.870 --> 02:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
including Georgia have already
 
02:03:59.390 --> 02:03:59.400 align:start position:0%
interpreted sensitive places to include
 
02:04:02.910 --> 02:04:02.920 align:start position:0%
polling places polling places are public
 
02:04:05.589 --> 02:04:05.599 align:start position:0%
areas they are used to conduct elections
 
02:04:07.950 --> 02:04:07.960 align:start position:0%
that are vital to our
 
02:04:10.109 --> 02:04:10.119 align:start position:0%
democracy also worth pointing out is
 
02:04:12.189 --> 02:04:12.199 align:start position:0%
that the same generation of people that
 
02:04:13.910 --> 02:04:13.920 align:start position:0%
added the Second Amendment to the
 
02:04:16.430 --> 02:04:16.440 align:start position:0%
Constitution also passed state laws
 
02:04:19.069 --> 02:04:19.079 align:start position:0%
prohibiting bringing guns to the polls
 
02:04:22.030 --> 02:04:22.040 align:start position:0%
for example the 1777
 
02:04:24.310 --> 02:04:24.320 align:start position:0%
Delaware state constitution provided
 
02:04:27.069 --> 02:04:27.079 align:start position:0%
that no person shall come armed to any
 
02:04:30.030 --> 02:04:30.040 align:start position:0%
of to come to any polling place and no
 
02:04:32.390 --> 02:04:32.400 align:start position:0%
muster of the militia shall be made on
 
02:04:35.629 --> 02:04:35.639 align:start position:0%
that day it further provided that no
 
02:04:37.669 --> 02:04:37.679 align:start position:0%
Battalion or company could come within a
 
02:04:40.589 --> 02:04:40.599 align:start position:0%
mile of the polling place for 24 hours
 
02:04:43.149 --> 02:04:43.159 align:start position:0%
before or after an election in order to
 
02:04:45.030 --> 02:04:45.040 align:start position:0%
prevent violence or force from being
 
02:04:48.430 --> 02:04:48.440 align:start position:0%
used at set elections that same year
 
02:04:51.109 --> 02:04:51.119 align:start position:0%
Maryland passed an identical law New
 
02:04:53.750 --> 02:04:53.760 align:start position:0%
York follow suit a decade later and more
 
02:04:55.669 --> 02:04:55.679 align:start position:0%
States added similar laws during
 
02:04:58.310 --> 02:04:58.320 align:start position:0%
Reconstruction and in the early 20th
 
02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:03.239 align:start position:0%
century the bottom line is hb3 352 isn't
 
02:05:05.910 --> 02:05:05.920 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional or an anti-gun law as
 
02:05:08.189 --> 02:05:08.199 align:start position:0%
some people would like to frame it what
 
02:05:10.990 --> 02:05:11.000 align:start position:0%
it is is a proter law that will lower
 
02:05:13.030 --> 02:05:13.040 align:start position:0%
the risk of armed intimidation happening
 
02:05:15.950 --> 02:05:15.960 align:start position:0%
in a place where it never should happen
 
02:05:18.229 --> 02:05:18.239 align:start position:0%
I ask the committee to give this bill an
 
02:05:21.790 --> 02:05:21.800 align:start position:0%
utapass recommendation and uh I will try
 
02:05:22.629 --> 02:05:22.639 align:start position:0%
to take
 
02:05:25.870 --> 02:05:25.880 align:start position:0%
questions thank you I obviously we've
 
02:05:27.470 --> 02:05:27.480 align:start position:0%
we've seen this bill a few times over
 
02:05:31.189 --> 02:05:31.199 align:start position:0%
the years um have you ever thought about
 
02:05:33.950 --> 02:05:33.960 align:start position:0%
limiting it to the intentional display
 
02:05:36.390 --> 02:05:36.400 align:start position:0%
of a firearm at a polling place versus
 
02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.040 align:start position:0%
just saying no firearms are polling
 
02:05:40.669 --> 02:05:40.679 align:start position:0%
places because if the object is to
 
02:05:42.669 --> 02:05:42.679 align:start position:0%
prevent intimidation if you can't see it
 
02:05:45.310 --> 02:05:45.320 align:start position:0%
you're not intimidating in in 2022 I
 
02:05:47.270 --> 02:05:47.280 align:start position:0%
actually filed a bill that that did that
 
02:05:51.189 --> 02:05:51.199 align:start position:0%
it limited to to concealed carry um uh
 
02:05:53.189 --> 02:05:53.199 align:start position:0%
it or it actually allowed concealed
 
02:05:55.390 --> 02:05:55.400 align:start position:0%
carry uh and prohibited open carry
 
02:05:58.149 --> 02:05:58.159 align:start position:0%
within 100 ft of a polling place uh the
 
02:06:00.790 --> 02:06:00.800 align:start position:0%
bill also uh amended our voter
 
02:06:03.790 --> 02:06:03.800 align:start position:0%
intimidation statute uh so it was a it
 
02:06:06.870 --> 02:06:06.880 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:09.310 --> 02:06:09.320 align:start position:0%
approach you would be open to that that
 
02:06:10.750 --> 02:06:10.760 align:start position:0%
concept I would definitely be open to
 
02:06:14.470 --> 02:06:14.480 align:start position:0%
that concept thank you further questions
 
02:06:18.229 --> 02:06:18.239 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:20.470 --> 02:06:20.480 align:start position:0%
testimony representative Horgan uh he
 
02:06:22.350 --> 02:06:22.360 align:start position:0%
introduced your bill of you're obviously
 
02:06:28.990 --> 02:06:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:06:31.830 --> 02:06:31.840 align:start position:0%
but um yes yes I'm I'm I'm the prime
 
02:06:33.430 --> 02:06:33.440 align:start position:0%
sponsor and I thank represent Muse for
 
02:06:34.870 --> 02:06:34.880 align:start position:0%
filling in with me I was afraid I
 
02:06:36.870 --> 02:06:36.880 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to be here at all so
 
02:06:39.910 --> 02:06:39.920 align:start position:0%
his he gave you a good rundown from what
 
02:06:41.830 --> 02:06:41.840 align:start position:0%
I heard from the history of it my
 
02:06:43.950 --> 02:06:43.960 align:start position:0%
history only goes back well 50 years or
 
02:06:46.069 --> 02:06:46.079 align:start position:0%
a little bit a little bit more so
 
02:06:47.910 --> 02:06:47.920 align:start position:0%
beginning with my written testimony here
 
02:06:50.910 --> 02:06:50.920 align:start position:0%
um I've been attending elections for
 
02:06:52.270 --> 02:06:52.280 align:start position:0%
long as I remember remember long before
 
02:06:55.390 --> 02:06:55.400 align:start position:0%
I turned 18 in 1974 my parents voted in
 
02:06:57.350 --> 02:06:57.360 align:start position:0%
every election they always made a point
 
02:06:58.870 --> 02:06:58.880 align:start position:0%
of bringing me and my sisters to the
 
02:07:01.189 --> 02:07:01.199 align:start position:0%
polling place with them so if you go
 
02:07:03.030 --> 02:07:03.040 align:start position:0%
back as long as I remember that's you
 
02:07:07.189 --> 02:07:07.199 align:start position:0%
know about 64 years or so and
 
02:07:09.750 --> 02:07:09.760 align:start position:0%
um um I've seen seen a lot of things in
 
02:07:11.830 --> 02:07:11.840 align:start position:0%
polling places over the years but I've
 
02:07:13.149 --> 02:07:13.159 align:start position:0%
actually never seen a violent or
 
02:07:15.229 --> 02:07:15.239 align:start position:0%
non-violent even a nonviolent crime
 
02:07:18.350 --> 02:07:18.360 align:start position:0%
being committed at the polls so
 
02:07:21.069 --> 02:07:21.079 align:start position:0%
U you know it's you know I've never seen
 
02:07:22.390 --> 02:07:22.400 align:start position:0%
anything happen actually the election
 
02:07:24.030 --> 02:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
officials couldn't have handle on their
 
02:07:25.709 --> 02:07:25.719 align:start position:0%
own although certainly I'm worried that
 
02:07:28.109 --> 02:07:28.119 align:start position:0%
something could happen the elections the
 
02:07:29.629 --> 02:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
whole issue of the context of Elections
 
02:07:31.270 --> 02:07:31.280 align:start position:0%
gets more and more controversial every
 
02:07:33.310 --> 02:07:33.320 align:start position:0%
cycle you know we've seen we have seen
 
02:07:35.750 --> 02:07:35.760 align:start position:0%
some pretty ugly things going on in
 
02:07:37.790 --> 02:07:37.800 align:start position:0%
other states around
 
02:07:41.109 --> 02:07:41.119 align:start position:0%
elections I'm I'm and I'm cognizant the
 
02:07:42.669 --> 02:07:42.679 align:start position:0%
possibility of problems I'm glad that
 
02:07:44.270 --> 02:07:44.280 align:start position:0%
polling places have a robust police
 
02:07:46.149 --> 02:07:46.159 align:start position:0%
presence I'm here in Durham we usually
 
02:07:48.790 --> 02:07:48.800 align:start position:0%
have at least two police officers who
 
02:07:52.109 --> 02:07:52.119 align:start position:0%
actually are wearing Kevlar vest um
 
02:07:54.390 --> 02:07:54.400 align:start position:0%
sometimes sometimes more so I think you
 
02:07:55.830 --> 02:07:55.840 align:start position:0%
if there was some sort of violent
 
02:07:57.390 --> 02:07:57.400 align:start position:0%
incident at the polling place I'm pretty
 
02:07:59.669 --> 02:07:59.679 align:start position:0%
confident they could respond to it same
 
02:08:01.350 --> 02:08:01.360 align:start position:0%
may be different in smaller towns with a
 
02:08:03.390 --> 02:08:03.400 align:start position:0%
less you know with a smaller police
 
02:08:05.030 --> 02:08:05.040 align:start position:0%
department but I
 
02:08:07.910 --> 02:08:07.920 align:start position:0%
I from a security P standpoint I don't
 
02:08:09.629 --> 02:08:09.639 align:start position:0%
think there's like any anything that's
 
02:08:11.950 --> 02:08:11.960 align:start position:0%
held by having random uh you know random
 
02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:13.360 align:start position:0%
voters pulling out their personal
 
02:08:16.549 --> 02:08:16.559 align:start position:0%
firearms and you know responding to a
 
02:08:19.470 --> 02:08:19.480 align:start position:0%
perceived threat so I mean I met the
 
02:08:21.510 --> 02:08:21.520 align:start position:0%
police officers they're there not just
 
02:08:23.629 --> 02:08:23.639 align:start position:0%
for deterring Crime they're an integral
 
02:08:25.390 --> 02:08:25.400 align:start position:0%
part of the vote counting process like
 
02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:26.350 align:start position:0%
part of the vote counting process like
law

02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:26.360 align:start position:0%
law
 
02:08:28.709 --> 02:08:28.719 align:start position:0%
enforcement they have the job of of
 
02:08:30.910 --> 02:08:30.920 align:start position:0%
making sure the deliver materials are
 
02:08:32.589 --> 02:08:32.599 align:start position:0%
delivered at the secretary's of State's
 
02:08:34.149 --> 02:08:34.159 align:start position:0%
office after they're all counted and
 
02:08:36.790 --> 02:08:36.800 align:start position:0%
filed and of course especially if have a
 
02:08:38.390 --> 02:08:38.400 align:start position:0%
high turnout election they have to be
 
02:08:39.790 --> 02:08:39.800 align:start position:0%
there to direct
 
02:08:44.030 --> 02:08:44.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:08:47.870 --> 02:08:47.880 align:start position:0%
bill in terms of a open intentional your
 
02:08:48.910 --> 02:08:48.920 align:start position:0%
you mentioned your session about
 
02:08:52.669 --> 02:08:52.679 align:start position:0%
intentional open caring I I mean I think
 
02:08:55.189 --> 02:08:55.199 align:start position:0%
that's I think trying to parse whether
 
02:08:58.189 --> 02:08:58.199 align:start position:0%
it's intentional or not if if somebody
 
02:09:00.030 --> 02:09:00.040 align:start position:0%
if somebody sees a gun regardless if
 
02:09:02.109 --> 02:09:02.119 align:start position:0%
it's intentional or unintentional their
 
02:09:03.870 --> 02:09:03.880 align:start position:0%
response you know is is going to be the
 
02:09:05.709 --> 02:09:05.719 align:start position:0%
same anyway and
 
02:09:08.790 --> 02:09:08.800 align:start position:0%
um and uh I mean
 
02:09:12.430 --> 02:09:12.440 align:start position:0%
would and um so anyway so I've never
 
02:09:14.430 --> 02:09:14.440 align:start position:0%
it's very rare to see voters open caring
 
02:09:15.990 --> 02:09:16.000 align:start position:0%
at the Ponting place I think it's a good
 
02:09:18.149 --> 02:09:18.159 align:start position:0%
thing they don't open carry um
 
02:09:20.229 --> 02:09:20.239 align:start position:0%
especially if it's someone I don't know
 
02:09:21.910 --> 02:09:21.920 align:start position:0%
I don't don't necessarily know if I can
 
02:09:23.830 --> 02:09:23.840 align:start position:0%
trust the person who's open carrying you
 
02:09:25.830 --> 02:09:25.840 align:start position:0%
know I don't always know
 
02:09:28.470 --> 02:09:28.480 align:start position:0%
like you know I don't always know like
 
02:09:31.069 --> 02:09:31.079 align:start position:0%
who's carrying gun who I trust to only
 
02:09:33.910 --> 02:09:33.920 align:start position:0%
use it if needed or who's just you know
 
02:09:35.990 --> 02:09:36.000 align:start position:0%
you know who might just pull it out for
 
02:09:39.950 --> 02:09:39.960 align:start position:0%
some bad reason and it's so it's um
 
02:09:42.790 --> 02:09:42.800 align:start position:0%
anyways it's uh this bill makes it as
 
02:09:44.189 --> 02:09:44.199 align:start position:0%
simple as possible for gun owners and
 
02:09:46.350 --> 02:09:46.360 align:start position:0%
non gun owners alike by banning guns and
 
02:09:48.750 --> 02:09:48.760 align:start position:0%
other deadly weapons within 100 ft of
 
02:09:51.870 --> 02:09:51.880 align:start position:0%
the Ping Place using the commonly aced
 
02:09:54.109 --> 02:09:54.119 align:start position:0%
meeting of the word phrase polling place
 
02:09:57.229 --> 02:09:57.239 align:start position:0%
um so that's appears in many laws that's
 
02:09:58.709 --> 02:09:58.719 align:start position:0%
clearly understood to be where the
 
02:10:00.870 --> 02:10:00.880 align:start position:0%
election activities are taking place um
 
02:10:02.629 --> 02:10:02.639 align:start position:0%
I know previous bills we sometimes had
 
02:10:06.030 --> 02:10:06.040 align:start position:0%
issues like um how do I know where the
 
02:10:08.990 --> 02:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
polling place is like if it's on there's
 
02:10:10.270 --> 02:10:10.280 align:start position:0%
um like
 
02:10:12.310 --> 02:10:12.320 align:start position:0%
there's there's like there's an issue
 
02:10:15.350 --> 02:10:15.360 align:start position:0%
with a uh School in a town I think
 
02:10:18.229 --> 02:10:18.239 align:start position:0%
believe it's believe it's haal where the
 
02:10:20.270 --> 02:10:20.280 align:start position:0%
school property AB buts a common duck
 
02:10:22.030 --> 02:10:22.040 align:start position:0%
hunting stuff there's much concerned
 
02:10:24.030 --> 02:10:24.040 align:start position:0%
about somehow somebody who's hunting
 
02:10:25.430 --> 02:10:25.440 align:start position:0%
ducks wandering on the wrong side of the
 
02:10:27.990 --> 02:10:28.000 align:start position:0%
property line and being unknowingly
 
02:10:31.750 --> 02:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
being at the Bing place but um and um we
 
02:10:35.910 --> 02:10:35.920 align:start position:0%
do make exceptions here for uh who do I
 
02:10:35.920 --> 02:10:40.430 align:start position:0%
do make exceptions here for uh who do I
see

02:10:40.430 --> 02:10:40.440 align:start position:0%
 
02:10:42.629 --> 02:10:42.639 align:start position:0%
exactly there's there's exceptions for
 
02:10:44.149 --> 02:10:44.159 align:start position:0%
the for the polling place for law
 
02:10:48.149 --> 02:10:48.159 align:start position:0%
enforcement um and also for Here We Go
 
02:10:49.990 --> 02:10:50.000 align:start position:0%
law enforcement officials on duty so
 
02:10:51.870 --> 02:10:51.880 align:start position:0%
obviously which we already have the uh
 
02:10:53.830 --> 02:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
you like the police officers in Durham
 
02:10:56.069 --> 02:10:56.079 align:start position:0%
um they have their service weapons uh
 
02:10:58.910 --> 02:10:58.920 align:start position:0%
with them uniformed Law Enforcement
 
02:11:00.430 --> 02:11:00.440 align:start position:0%
Officers while they're exercising their
 
02:11:02.549 --> 02:11:02.559 align:start position:0%
right to vote um that was inspired
 
02:11:04.510 --> 02:11:04.520 align:start position:0%
especially by our newly elected County
 
02:11:08.470 --> 02:11:08.480 align:start position:0%
Sheriff Katherine bone who um well she
 
02:11:10.830 --> 02:11:10.840 align:start position:0%
voted in civilian clo uh this year she
 
02:11:12.310 --> 02:11:12.320 align:start position:0%
was not yet the sheriff but she was a
 
02:11:14.030 --> 02:11:14.040 align:start position:0%
police officer in another jurisdiction
 
02:11:15.510 --> 02:11:15.520 align:start position:0%
and so she would often stop by her way
 
02:11:16.910 --> 02:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
to work so that's perfectly appropriate
 
02:11:19.189 --> 02:11:19.199 align:start position:0%
to wear her whole uniform including the
 
02:11:21.990 --> 02:11:22.000 align:start position:0%
service revolver which
 
02:11:24.950 --> 02:11:24.960 align:start position:0%
99.99% of the time is mostly just there
 
02:11:28.149 --> 02:11:28.159 align:start position:0%
as part of the uniform you know police
 
02:11:31.750 --> 02:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
officers uh routinely police officers uh
 
02:11:33.350 --> 02:11:33.360 align:start position:0%
they're always ready to fire the service
 
02:11:35.030 --> 02:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
revolvers but it's something they avoid
 
02:11:38.069 --> 02:11:38.079 align:start position:0%
doing unless absolutely necessary so um
 
02:11:40.149 --> 02:11:40.159 align:start position:0%
and also non-uniform law enforcement
 
02:11:41.990 --> 02:11:42.000 align:start position:0%
officers who are concealed carrying
 
02:11:43.790 --> 02:11:43.800 align:start position:0%
their own their service weapons so
 
02:11:47.229 --> 02:11:47.239 align:start position:0%
that's um just I admit that applies only
 
02:11:49.830 --> 02:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
to you know law enforcement officers who
 
02:11:51.910 --> 02:11:51.920 align:start position:0%
you know um
 
02:11:53.709 --> 02:11:53.719 align:start position:0%
are not wearing the uniforms at the time
 
02:11:55.350 --> 02:11:55.360 align:start position:0%
so they can still you know especially
 
02:11:57.149 --> 02:11:57.159 align:start position:0%
you know they may be like a detective or
 
02:11:58.870 --> 02:11:58.880 align:start position:0%
something like that where they you know
 
02:12:00.069 --> 02:12:00.079 align:start position:0%
they they have to have the service
 
02:12:01.470 --> 02:12:01.480 align:start position:0%
weapon you know it's part of their
 
02:12:03.629 --> 02:12:03.639 align:start position:0%
outfit but they're not openly displaying
 
02:12:07.390 --> 02:12:07.400 align:start position:0%
it while they're on duty and um also you
 
02:12:10.350 --> 02:12:10.360 align:start position:0%
can secure your unloaded firearm in a
 
02:12:12.470 --> 02:12:12.480 align:start position:0%
motor vehicle while at the poing place
 
02:12:14.109 --> 02:12:14.119 align:start position:0%
that does mean you have to unload the
 
02:12:15.830 --> 02:12:15.840 align:start position:0%
firearm you do have to lock it up but
 
02:12:18.189 --> 02:12:18.199 align:start position:0%
you can park it at the poing place even
 
02:12:20.470 --> 02:12:20.480 align:start position:0%
if your even if that sometimes happens
 
02:12:22.950 --> 02:12:22.960 align:start position:0%
your parking space is within the 100t
 
02:12:27.350 --> 02:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
foot radius so that's um and finally I
 
02:12:28.629 --> 02:12:28.639 align:start position:0%
just added a little thing to the
 
02:12:31.470 --> 02:12:31.480 align:start position:0%
previous bill that we had uh last year
 
02:12:35.109 --> 02:12:35.119 align:start position:0%
which is making that making your uh
 
02:12:37.549 --> 02:12:37.559 align:start position:0%
making adding another reason why you can
 
02:12:40.149 --> 02:12:40.159 align:start position:0%
get an absentee ballot so we added we
 
02:12:42.430 --> 02:12:42.440 align:start position:0%
added a thing quote I am willing or
 
02:12:44.189 --> 02:12:44.199 align:start position:0%
unwilling to comply with the prohibition
 
02:12:46.910 --> 02:12:46.920 align:start position:0%
of firearms at ping places in RSA
 
02:12:51.189 --> 02:12:51.199 align:start position:0%
15928 so that's uh that's not strictly
 
02:12:53.109 --> 02:12:53.119 align:start position:0%
speaking that's not necessary we have a
 
02:12:55.069 --> 02:12:55.079 align:start position:0%
very permissive absentee voting laws
 
02:12:58.430 --> 02:12:58.440 align:start position:0%
anyway but and um I don't know how many
 
02:12:59.990 --> 02:13:00.000 align:start position:0%
people would check it off but like if
 
02:13:03.310 --> 02:13:03.320 align:start position:0%
you absolutely you know cannot stand to
 
02:13:04.629 --> 02:13:04.639 align:start position:0%
lock your gun in the car if you
 
02:13:05.910 --> 02:13:05.920 align:start position:0%
absolutely can't stand to leave it at
 
02:13:07.109 --> 02:13:07.119 align:start position:0%
home if you
 
02:13:09.549 --> 02:13:09.559 align:start position:0%
absolutely can't bear to be without it
 
02:13:12.629 --> 02:13:12.639 align:start position:0%
for the few minutes it takes to check in
 
02:13:15.229 --> 02:13:15.239 align:start position:0%
at the check in with the uh ballot
 
02:13:16.709 --> 02:13:16.719 align:start position:0%
officials and fill out your B if you
 
02:13:18.390 --> 02:13:18.400 align:start position:0%
absolutely can't stand that if you just
 
02:13:20.470 --> 02:13:20.480 align:start position:0%
either can't bear it because you don't
 
02:13:22.229 --> 02:13:22.239 align:start position:0%
think it's safe you just can't bear you
 
02:13:24.189 --> 02:13:24.199 align:start position:0%
just can't bear to not be wearing your
 
02:13:27.589 --> 02:13:27.599 align:start position:0%
gun you can get an absentee ballot and
 
02:13:30.109 --> 02:13:30.119 align:start position:0%
mail it in so that um I'm just trying to
 
02:13:32.069 --> 02:13:32.079 align:start position:0%
avoid disenfranchising anybody who wants
 
02:13:34.069 --> 02:13:34.079 align:start position:0%
to vote even you know just I don't want
 
02:13:35.950 --> 02:13:35.960 align:start position:0%
to disenfranchise gun owners from from
 
02:13:40.510 --> 02:13:40.520 align:start position:0%
from voting so that's uh so that's
 
02:13:42.430 --> 02:13:42.440 align:start position:0%
that's my bill and um you know you've
 
02:13:44.189 --> 02:13:44.199 align:start position:0%
already heard about from refin Muse so
 
02:13:45.589 --> 02:13:45.599 align:start position:0%
he's you've got like two pretty good
 
02:13:47.709 --> 02:13:47.719 align:start position:0%
arguments in favor of it
 
02:13:50.109 --> 02:13:50.119 align:start position:0%
and I see at least one hand raised so
 
02:13:53.350 --> 02:13:53.360 align:start position:0%
perhaps I'll be answering a
 
02:13:55.709 --> 02:13:55.719 align:start position:0%
question um representative
 
02:13:58.030 --> 02:13:58.040 align:start position:0%
Sher uh representative Horgan would you
 
02:14:00.350 --> 02:14:00.360 align:start position:0%
be amenable to a friendly Amendment to
 
02:14:03.430 --> 02:14:03.440 align:start position:0%
the bill that replaced the word carry
 
02:14:07.990 --> 02:14:08.000 align:start position:0%
with openly display um sure yes I me I
 
02:14:09.549 --> 02:14:09.559 align:start position:0%
mean that's up to that's up to you I
 
02:14:12.270 --> 02:14:12.280 align:start position:0%
mean I I I mean I'm not not a big fan of
 
02:14:14.669 --> 02:14:14.679 align:start position:0%
these things where like with our I
 
02:14:16.149 --> 02:14:16.159 align:start position:0%
didn't vote for the house rule where we
 
02:14:18.390 --> 02:14:18.400 align:start position:0%
had you know where we say you're not
 
02:14:19.629 --> 02:14:19.639 align:start position:0%

but I I I certainly be happy with I
 
02:14:26.510 --> 02:14:26.520 align:start position:0%
would consider a friendly Amendment
 
02:14:29.149 --> 02:14:29.159 align:start position:0%
representative and certainly uh if that
 
02:14:30.510 --> 02:14:30.520 align:start position:0%
that gets more votes for it I'm
 
02:14:37.069 --> 02:14:37.079 align:start position:0%
 
02:14:39.830 --> 02:14:39.840 align:start position:0%

02:14:53.830 --> 02:14:53.840 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of the
 
02:14:55.109 --> 02:14:55.119 align:start position:0%
committee for the record my name is Tom
 
02:14:57.709 --> 02:14:57.719 align:start position:0%
Manion I'm representing Hillsboro 1 uh
 
02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:00.360 align:start position:0%
the town of pelum uh I'm testifying in
 
02:15:03.549 --> 02:15:03.559 align:start position:0%
opposition of HB 352 uh in an age of
 
02:15:05.390 --> 02:15:05.400 align:start position:0%
increasing divisiveness especially
 
02:15:07.390 --> 02:15:07.400 align:start position:0%
centered around politics it's important
 
02:15:08.910 --> 02:15:08.920 align:start position:0%
that every person be capable of
 
02:15:11.470 --> 02:15:11.480 align:start position:0%
Defending themselves should the need
 
02:15:13.910 --> 02:15:13.920 align:start position:0%
arise and every person's first line of
 
02:15:16.629 --> 02:15:16.639 align:start position:0%
defense is themselves we should not have
 
02:15:19.069 --> 02:15:19.079 align:start position:0%
to choose between exe exercising our
 
02:15:20.310 --> 02:15:20.320 align:start position:0%
right to vote and our right to
 
02:15:22.990 --> 02:15:23.000 align:start position:0%
self-defense on Election Day I'm also
 
02:15:25.149 --> 02:15:25.159 align:start position:0%
not supportive of the expanding the
 
02:15:27.910 --> 02:15:27.920 align:start position:0%
reasons for absentee voting when I think
 
02:15:29.510 --> 02:15:29.520 align:start position:0%
the better solution is just leave things
 
02:15:31.750 --> 02:15:31.760 align:start position:0%
the way they are with that I ask the
 
02:15:35.629 --> 02:15:35.639 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:41.790 --> 02:15:41.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:53.030 --> 02:15:53.040 align:start position:0%
 
02:15:54.229 --> 02:15:54.239 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm
 
02:15:55.589 --> 02:15:55.599 align:start position:0%
representative Donald McFarland from
 
02:15:57.510 --> 02:15:57.520 align:start position:0%
Orange and I thank you for your time the
 
02:15:59.350 --> 02:15:59.360 align:start position:0%
testimony represents My Views and most
 
02:16:00.510 --> 02:16:00.520 align:start position:0%
importantly the views and interests of
 
02:16:03.030 --> 02:16:03.040 align:start position:0%
my constituents uh in graft 18 the
 
02:16:04.750 --> 02:16:04.760 align:start position:0%
testimony is not made on behalf of any
 
02:16:06.470 --> 02:16:06.480 align:start position:0%
private employer nor should be construed
 
02:16:08.270 --> 02:16:08.280 align:start position:0%
to represent the views of any of my
 
02:16:10.430 --> 02:16:10.440 align:start position:0%
employers elections are the Cornerstone
 
02:16:12.069 --> 02:16:12.079 align:start position:0%
of our democracy and this
 
02:16:15.549 --> 02:16:15.559 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional Bill House Bill 352 act
 
02:16:17.709 --> 02:16:17.719 align:start position:0%
to prohibit people from traditional
 
02:16:20.109 --> 02:16:20.119 align:start position:0%
in-person participation in the voting
 
02:16:22.149 --> 02:16:22.159 align:start position:0%
process to my honorable colleague from
 
02:16:24.069 --> 02:16:24.079 align:start position:0%
Durham's assertion that he does not seek
 
02:16:26.549 --> 02:16:26.559 align:start position:0%
to disenfranchise voters nevertheless
 
02:16:29.149 --> 02:16:29.159 align:start position:0%
this is exactly what this bill achieves
 
02:16:31.470 --> 02:16:31.480 align:start position:0%
yes there is a provision for absentee
 
02:16:33.910 --> 02:16:33.920 align:start position:0%
ballots and I'll get to
 
02:16:38.549 --> 02:16:38.559 align:start position:0%
that the the bill as written may work in
 
02:16:42.669 --> 02:16:42.679 align:start position:0%
his mind I would suggest not for voters
 
02:16:44.950 --> 02:16:44.960 align:start position:0%
it most certainly does not work for
 
02:16:46.990 --> 02:16:47.000 align:start position:0%
election workers like the Selectmen the
 
02:16:48.750 --> 02:16:48.760 align:start position:0%
ballot clerks the supervisors of the
 
02:16:51.629 --> 02:16:51.639 align:start position:0%
checklist candidates holding sign
 
02:16:54.150 --> 02:16:54.160 align:start position:0%
near the polling place or wishing to use
 
02:16:56.709 --> 02:16:56.719 align:start position:0%
the restroom and so
 
02:16:58.990 --> 02:16:59.000 align:start position:0%
forth my colleague from Durham I didn't
 
02:17:00.910 --> 02:17:00.920 align:start position:0%
hear all of his testimony I was still in
 
02:17:03.750 --> 02:17:03.760 align:start position:0%
in judiciary next door but I heard the
 
02:17:05.709 --> 02:17:05.719 align:start position:0%
end of his testimony he expressed
 
02:17:08.589 --> 02:17:08.599 align:start position:0%
concern specifically around open carry
 
02:17:10.629 --> 02:17:10.639 align:start position:0%
and I dare say he has read his own bill
 
02:17:11.870 --> 02:17:11.880 align:start position:0%
and he knows perfectly well that this
 
02:17:14.110 --> 02:17:14.120 align:start position:0%
bill applies equally to concealed carry
 
02:17:16.070 --> 02:17:16.080 align:start position:0%
and would be objectionable in either
 
02:17:18.709 --> 02:17:18.719 align:start position:0%
form uh and as I said earlier it is
 
02:17:20.629 --> 02:17:20.639 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional uh it is objectionable
 
02:17:23.509 --> 02:17:23.519 align:start position:0%
to to part one uh both article 2A and
 
02:17:27.270 --> 02:17:27.280 align:start position:0%
article 11 uh and I think that um when
 
02:17:29.669 --> 02:17:29.679 align:start position:0%
you consider this you need to also
 
02:17:33.110 --> 02:17:33.120 align:start position:0%
consider the election law impact this
 
02:17:34.389 --> 02:17:34.399 align:start position:0%
essentially is a
 
02:17:37.589 --> 02:17:37.599 align:start position:0%
backdoor bill that turns absente ballots
 
02:17:40.910 --> 02:17:40.920 align:start position:0%
into early voting I would recommend
 
02:17:44.190 --> 02:17:44.200 align:start position:0%
strongly that this committee recommend
 
02:17:46.910 --> 02:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
itl on the bill and that this committee
 
02:17:48.950 --> 02:17:48.960 align:start position:0%
recommend that this bill be referred to
 
02:17:50.629 --> 02:17:50.639 align:start position:0%
the house election law committee thank
 
02:17:50.639 --> 02:17:53.230 align:start position:0%
the house election law committee thank
you

02:17:53.230 --> 02:17:53.240 align:start position:0%
 
02:17:58.349 --> 02:17:58.359 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:12.469 --> 02:18:12.479 align:start position:0%
 
02:18:14.549 --> 02:18:14.559 align:start position:0%
gon thank you Mr chair honorable
 
02:18:17.110 --> 02:18:17.120 align:start position:0%
committee uh for record representative
 
02:18:18.990 --> 02:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
Henry gon philbo 29th
 
02:18:21.629 --> 02:18:21.639 align:start position:0%
District so once again we are talking
 
02:18:24.110 --> 02:18:24.120 align:start position:0%
about violating somebody's an eliable
 
02:18:26.030 --> 02:18:26.040 align:start position:0%
right in order to allow them to exercise
 
02:18:28.750 --> 02:18:28.760 align:start position:0%
another right when we create areas where
 
02:18:30.429 --> 02:18:30.439 align:start position:0%
people are not allowed to carry their
 
02:18:32.469 --> 02:18:32.479 align:start position:0%
firearms we are creating areas of
 
02:18:35.389 --> 02:18:35.399 align:start position:0%
victims where shootings have happened
 
02:18:38.190 --> 02:18:38.200 align:start position:0%
and license to carry has been allowed
 
02:18:40.669 --> 02:18:40.679 align:start position:0%
the shooting duration extremity and
 
02:18:42.070 --> 02:18:42.080 align:start position:0%
number of casualties has been
 
02:18:43.509 --> 02:18:43.519 align:start position:0%
significantly reduced and this is on
 
02:18:45.469 --> 02:18:45.479 align:start position:0%
record throughout the United States
 
02:18:47.270 --> 02:18:47.280 align:start position:0%
where mass shootings have had the most
 
02:18:49.589 --> 02:18:49.599 align:start position:0%
impact is in places where Firearms are
 
02:18:52.190 --> 02:18:52.200 align:start position:0%
restricted where the Constitution has
 
02:18:53.709 --> 02:18:53.719 align:start position:0%
not been followed and where the rights
 
02:18:55.750 --> 02:18:55.760 align:start position:0%
of the people have been violated by
 
02:18:58.549 --> 02:18:58.559 align:start position:0%
their own government now I heard a uh I
 
02:19:00.309 --> 02:19:00.319 align:start position:0%
heard a suggestion to secure a firearm
 
02:19:01.389 --> 02:19:01.399 align:start position:0%
in a
 
02:19:04.589 --> 02:19:04.599 align:start position:0%
car the fastest loss of firearms is a
 
02:19:07.230 --> 02:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
smash and grab from a vehicle there are
 
02:19:08.549 --> 02:19:08.559 align:start position:0%
police officers that have lost their
 
02:19:10.349 --> 02:19:10.359 align:start position:0%
service weapons in a smash and grab from
 
02:19:12.750 --> 02:19:12.760 align:start position:0%
a vehicle locking your vehicle in a car
 
02:19:14.750 --> 02:19:14.760 align:start position:0%
loaded or unloaded is not securing a
 
02:19:18.110 --> 02:19:18.120 align:start position:0%
firearm on a personage or in a safe or
 
02:19:20.750 --> 02:19:20.760 align:start position:0%
in a domicile it is putting it in a
 
02:19:22.389 --> 02:19:22.399 align:start position:0%
mobile place that you can smash into
 
02:19:25.469 --> 02:19:25.479 align:start position:0%
very easily that is not safe securing of
 
02:19:28.070 --> 02:19:28.080 align:start position:0%
a firearm no matter where you are school
 
02:19:29.950 --> 02:19:29.960 align:start position:0%
grounds are otherwise polling station or
 
02:19:32.070 --> 02:19:32.080 align:start position:0%
otherwise so I would sub I would submit
 
02:19:33.509 --> 02:19:33.519 align:start position:0%
to you that if you are responsible to
 
02:19:36.030 --> 02:19:36.040 align:start position:0%
carry a firearm you should not be H uh
 
02:19:37.910 --> 02:19:37.920 align:start position:0%
have to store it in a place that is
 
02:19:40.469 --> 02:19:40.479 align:start position:0%
unsecure but in final I will also say
 
02:19:43.589 --> 02:19:43.599 align:start position:0%
that this is simply a violation of New
 
02:19:45.549 --> 02:19:45.559 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state constitution and of the
 
02:19:47.709 --> 02:19:47.719 align:start position:0%
United States con Constitution and of
 
02:19:49.630 --> 02:19:49.640 align:start position:0%

prohibiting Firearms at a polling
 
02:21:58.670 --> 02:21:58.680 align:start position:0%
place um a couple of weeks ago uh in
 
02:22:02.030 --> 02:22:02.040 align:start position:0%
Portsmith um we held a people's March
 
02:22:05.349 --> 02:22:05.359 align:start position:0%
and I arrived a half hour early to the
 
02:22:07.790 --> 02:22:07.800 align:start position:0%
South Church in Portsmith I was one of
 
02:22:10.830 --> 02:22:10.840 align:start position:0%
the many organizers my son dropped me
 
02:22:12.630 --> 02:22:12.640 align:start position:0%
off in front of the church and said Mom
 
02:22:14.150 --> 02:22:14.160 align:start position:0%
there are guys with
 
02:22:16.950 --> 02:22:16.960 align:start position:0%
guns he saw them before I did I quickly
 
02:22:18.830 --> 02:22:18.840 align:start position:0%
said oh oh they're they're probably
 
02:22:20.990 --> 02:22:21.000 align:start position:0%
police and he knew better than me he
 
02:22:23.790 --> 02:22:23.800 align:start position:0%
said no they're not one was head to toe
 
02:22:26.349 --> 02:22:26.359 align:start position:0%
black but not a stitch of Pat or patch
 
02:22:28.910 --> 02:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
identifying him as Portsmouth Police the
 
02:22:31.429 --> 02:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
other wore a t-shirt with the FW and a
 
02:22:34.190 --> 02:22:34.200 align:start position:0%
mask I took a deep breath and with a pit
 
02:22:36.270 --> 02:22:36.280 align:start position:0%
in my stomach I exited the car brushed
 
02:22:38.270 --> 02:22:38.280 align:start position:0%
past the armed men and entered the
 
02:22:40.670 --> 02:22:40.680 align:start position:0%
church already the band was playing and
 
02:22:42.190 --> 02:22:42.200 align:start position:0%
many people were holding signs and
 
02:22:44.830 --> 02:22:44.840 align:start position:0%
marching and dancing in place safety and
 
02:22:47.309 --> 02:22:47.319 align:start position:0%
numbers I thought by the time the event
 
02:22:50.790 --> 02:22:50.800 align:start position:0%
started Portsmouth Police had arrived
 
02:22:53.190 --> 02:22:53.200 align:start position:0%
uh my son actually came back with my
 
02:22:55.950 --> 02:22:55.960 align:start position:0%
husband and they stayed on the sidewalk
 
02:22:58.349 --> 02:22:58.359 align:start position:0%
to I guess make sure everything was okay
 
02:22:59.910 --> 02:22:59.920 align:start position:0%
and they were the last to enter the
 
02:23:02.910 --> 02:23:02.920 align:start position:0%
church and they said the um the armed
 
02:23:05.429 --> 02:23:05.439 align:start position:0%
men did not enter the church there was
 
02:23:07.550 --> 02:23:07.560 align:start position:0%
no question that these men were there to
 
02:23:09.750 --> 02:23:09.760 align:start position:0%
intimidate and Bully I was worried and
 
02:23:11.349 --> 02:23:11.359 align:start position:0%
concerned for all the people that I
 
02:23:13.110 --> 02:23:13.120 align:start position:0%
personally invited to this event I
 
02:23:14.870 --> 02:23:14.880 align:start position:0%
encouraged them to raise their voice
 
02:23:17.510 --> 02:23:17.520 align:start position:0%
only for them to be greeted with armed
 
02:23:19.630 --> 02:23:19.640 align:start position:0%
protesters I don't tell this story to
 
02:23:22.630 --> 02:23:22.640 align:start position:0%
make people panic or to clutch my pearls
 
02:23:24.830 --> 02:23:24.840 align:start position:0%
I tell it to illustrate that people do
 
02:23:27.389 --> 02:23:27.399 align:start position:0%
use their guns to intimidate to scare
 
02:23:29.550 --> 02:23:29.560 align:start position:0%
and to attempt to silence and this
 
02:23:31.349 --> 02:23:31.359 align:start position:0%
happened in one of the safest states in
 
02:23:33.790 --> 02:23:33.800 align:start position:0%
the country and one of the safest cities
 
02:23:36.309 --> 02:23:36.319 align:start position:0%
just a few weeks ago according to a
 
02:23:37.990 --> 02:23:38.000 align:start position:0%
survey of local election officials
 
02:23:41.349 --> 02:23:41.359 align:start position:0%
across the US 38% report experiencing
 
02:23:43.990 --> 02:23:44.000 align:start position:0%
threats harassment or abuse and 54
 
02:23:46.150 --> 02:23:46.160 align:start position:0%
concern 54% are concerned about the
 
02:23:48.230 --> 02:23:48.240 align:start position:0%
safety of their colleagues and according
 
02:23:50.070 --> 02:23:50.080 align:start position:0%
to one election official here in New
 
02:23:52.309 --> 02:23:52.319 align:start position:0%
York New Hampshire threats and
 
02:23:54.830 --> 02:23:54.840 align:start position:0%
harassment are deterrent to Recruitment
 
02:23:56.870 --> 02:23:56.880 align:start position:0%
and the presence of firearms creates a
 
02:23:58.630 --> 02:23:58.640 align:start position:0%
potentially serious deterrent to the
 
02:24:01.309 --> 02:24:01.319 align:start position:0%
efficiency and reliability of pull work
 
02:24:03.429 --> 02:24:03.439 align:start position:0%
I am not an expert on the Constitution
 
02:24:05.070 --> 02:24:05.080 align:start position:0%
but I do know that the right to bear
 
02:24:06.950 --> 02:24:06.960 align:start position:0%
arms the right to vote and the right to
 
02:24:10.469 --> 02:24:10.479 align:start position:0%
free speech must and should coexist with
 
02:24:12.830 --> 02:24:12.840 align:start position:0%
laws governing all of them in New
 
02:24:14.670 --> 02:24:14.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire at a polling place the law
 
02:24:16.670 --> 02:24:16.680 align:start position:0%
requires a visible and audible
 
02:24:18.630 --> 02:24:18.640 align:start position:0%
electioneering Zone which protects
 
02:24:20.710 --> 02:24:20.720 align:start position:0%
freedom of speech but the law also
 
02:24:23.389 --> 02:24:23.399 align:start position:0%
requires a no election nearing zone so
 
02:24:25.349 --> 02:24:25.359 align:start position:0%
voters can vote without interruption
 
02:24:27.710 --> 02:24:27.720 align:start position:0%
interference or safety concerns this
 
02:24:29.309 --> 02:24:29.319 align:start position:0%
creates a safe environment in which
 
02:24:31.190 --> 02:24:31.200 align:start position:0%
Granite Staters can exercise their right
 
02:24:33.990 --> 02:24:34.000 align:start position:0%
to vote this should include prohibiting
 
02:24:36.750 --> 02:24:36.760 align:start position:0%
Firearms no one is taking away someone's
 
02:24:38.870 --> 02:24:38.880 align:start position:0%
right to have a firearm just a limit on
 
02:24:41.590 --> 02:24:41.600 align:start position:0%
one day in one place where if allowed
 
02:24:43.910 --> 02:24:43.920 align:start position:0%
Firearms can be used to scare intimidate
 
02:24:45.990 --> 02:24:46.000 align:start position:0%
and threaten and no one should feel that
 
02:24:48.790 --> 02:24:48.800 align:start position:0%
way while exercising their right to vote
 
02:24:52.950 --> 02:24:52.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:24:55.190 --> 02:24:55.200 align:start position:0%
testimony the chair recognizes The
 
02:25:08.630 --> 02:25:08.640 align:start position:0%
 
02:25:11.429 --> 02:25:11.439 align:start position:0%
Stone good
 
02:25:13.670 --> 02:25:13.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon I'm Jonathan Stone from
 
02:25:16.590 --> 02:25:16.600 align:start position:0%
clamont New Hampshire and uh I rise in
 
02:25:20.750 --> 02:25:20.760 align:start position:0%
opposition of House Bill 352 very simply
 
02:25:22.269 --> 02:25:22.279 align:start position:0%
why would any citizen have to give up
 
02:25:24.670 --> 02:25:24.680 align:start position:0%
one right to exercise another right it
 
02:25:26.070 --> 02:25:26.080 align:start position:0%
seems this bill is based mostly on
 
02:25:28.510 --> 02:25:28.520 align:start position:0%
feelings and not facts and did any law
 
02:25:30.389 --> 02:25:30.399 align:start position:0%
enforcement ask for this legislation be
 
02:25:32.950 --> 02:25:32.960 align:start position:0%
pushed at this level I would recommend
 
02:25:35.349 --> 02:25:35.359 align:start position:0%
it Ling this bill I looked at some of
 
02:25:37.230 --> 02:25:37.240 align:start position:0%
the quick numbers that representative
 
02:25:39.990 --> 02:25:40.000 align:start position:0%
Muse comes out with and I believe the
 
02:25:42.550 --> 02:25:42.560 align:start position:0%
numbers are actually 18 states plus DC
 
02:25:44.830 --> 02:25:44.840 align:start position:0%
prohibit them explicitly there's partial
 
02:25:47.790 --> 02:25:47.800 align:start position:0%
restrictions in seven states and uh 25
 
02:25:49.950 --> 02:25:49.960 align:start position:0%
of our states has zero restrictions on
 
02:25:53.030 --> 02:25:53.040 align:start position:0%
fire in polling places uh I spoke with
 
02:25:54.950 --> 02:25:54.960 align:start position:0%
the deputy chief of the clont police
 
02:25:56.230 --> 02:25:56.240 align:start position:0%
department yesterday in reference to any
 
02:25:57.590 --> 02:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
issues we've had during our election
 
02:25:59.590 --> 02:25:59.600 align:start position:0%
Cycles which I've partaken in about
 
02:26:01.429 --> 02:26:01.439 align:start position:0%
let's say since 2017 I've been at every
 
02:26:03.750 --> 02:26:03.760 align:start position:0%
election in the city of clamon and also
 
02:26:05.590 --> 02:26:05.600 align:start position:0%
throughout Sullivan County for various
 
02:26:07.910 --> 02:26:07.920 align:start position:0%
positions I've ran for and there's never
 
02:26:09.389 --> 02:26:09.399 align:start position:0%
really been a significant issue with
 
02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:11.439 align:start position:0%
firearms that I've ever been noted and I
 
02:26:12.750 --> 02:26:12.760 align:start position:0%
checked with the clerks quite often to
 
02:26:15.349 --> 02:26:15.359 align:start position:0%
ask if there's any problems and I see
 
02:26:16.750 --> 02:26:16.760 align:start position:0%
this bill as just being one that's
 
02:26:18.670 --> 02:26:18.680 align:start position:0%
unnecessary I see a segment of the bill
 
02:26:20.870 --> 02:26:20.880 align:start position:0%
that says even licensed uh if you want
 
02:26:23.389 --> 02:26:23.399 align:start position:0%
to talk about licensing and federal law
 
02:26:25.870 --> 02:26:25.880 align:start position:0%
most people are unaware that under the
 
02:26:28.550 --> 02:26:28.560 align:start position:0%
safe uh school zone act which is the gun
 
02:26:30.790 --> 02:26:30.800 align:start position:0%
free zone if you're a license invented
 
02:26:32.750 --> 02:26:32.760 align:start position:0%
in your home state you're Exempted from
 
02:26:35.110 --> 02:26:35.120 align:start position:0%
them school zones that's anybody can
 
02:26:37.309 --> 02:26:37.319 align:start position:0%
research under the federal code we need
 
02:26:40.230 --> 02:26:40.240 align:start position:0%
to stop looking at uh feelings of
 
02:26:42.030 --> 02:26:42.040 align:start position:0%
individuals when it comes to giving up
 
02:26:44.030 --> 02:26:44.040 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights I see this bill is
 
02:26:45.630 --> 02:26:45.640 align:start position:0%
just problematic overall and I'd like to
 
02:26:46.750 --> 02:26:46.760 align:start position:0%
thank you for your time if you have any
 
02:26:48.190 --> 02:26:48.200 align:start position:0%
questions I'll take
 
02:26:51.150 --> 02:26:51.160 align:start position:0%
them thank you just um real quick to
 
02:26:54.150 --> 02:26:54.160 align:start position:0%
expand on the point you just made so
 
02:26:57.070 --> 02:26:57.080 align:start position:0%
right now in New Hampshire if you go to
 
02:27:00.710 --> 02:27:00.720 align:start position:0%
a polling place and it's in a school and
 
02:27:02.710 --> 02:27:02.720 align:start position:0%
you do not have a license to carry are
 
02:27:04.670 --> 02:27:04.680 align:start position:0%
you not in violation of federal law
 
02:27:06.030 --> 02:27:06.040 align:start position:0%
because the state of New Hampshire
 
02:27:07.550 --> 02:27:07.560 align:start position:0%
elected to be a constitutional carry
 
02:27:09.349 --> 02:27:09.359 align:start position:0%
state it's my understanding that the US
 
02:27:11.389 --> 02:27:11.399 align:start position:0%
attorney's office at the time had said
 
02:27:12.950 --> 02:27:12.960 align:start position:0%
there'd be no prosecutions under it
 
02:27:14.550 --> 02:27:14.560 align:start position:0%
unless there was a companion case of
 
02:27:16.670 --> 02:27:16.680 align:start position:0%
criminal activi such as drug trafficking
 
02:27:18.590 --> 02:27:18.600 align:start position:0%
for which the real intent of the gun
 
02:27:20.429 --> 02:27:20.439 align:start position:0%
free zone is is drug trafficking is an
 
02:27:23.110 --> 02:27:23.120 align:start position:0%
enhanced penalty uh if you have a
 
02:27:25.429 --> 02:27:25.439 align:start position:0%
license it's clearly an exemption under
 
02:27:29.429 --> 02:27:29.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:31.950 --> 02:27:31.960 align:start position:0%
you that's all thank you thank you uh
 
02:27:55.790 --> 02:27:55.800 align:start position:0%
 
02:27:58.550 --> 02:27:58.560 align:start position:0%
okay this interest this legislation has
 
02:28:00.750 --> 02:28:00.760 align:start position:0%
an interesting twist in that it violates
 
02:28:03.750 --> 02:28:03.760 align:start position:0%
not only one protected right but two two
 
02:28:05.150 --> 02:28:05.160 align:start position:0%
infringements on our rights for the
 
02:28:07.469 --> 02:28:07.479 align:start position:0%
price of one bill if you want to
 
02:28:09.070 --> 02:28:09.080 align:start position:0%
practice your fundamental human right to
 
02:28:10.870 --> 02:28:10.880 align:start position:0%
self-defense on Election Day according
 
02:28:13.750 --> 02:28:13.760 align:start position:0%
to the bill you are not allowed to if
 
02:28:15.190 --> 02:28:15.200 align:start position:0%
you want to practice your protected
 
02:28:16.990 --> 02:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
right to vote you aren't allowed to
 
02:28:18.590 --> 02:28:18.600 align:start position:0%
practice your protected fundamental
 
02:28:20.750 --> 02:28:20.760 align:start position:0%
human right to self-defense
 
02:28:22.710 --> 02:28:22.720 align:start position:0%
I can't make it make sense and after
 
02:28:24.630 --> 02:28:24.640 align:start position:0%
hearing the sponsor speak he can't even
 
02:28:27.150 --> 02:28:27.160 align:start position:0%
make it make sense and I don't care
 
02:28:29.269 --> 02:28:29.279 align:start position:0%
about the voting via absentee ballot
 
02:28:32.269 --> 02:28:32.279 align:start position:0%
provision these are the same people who
 
02:28:34.429 --> 02:28:34.439 align:start position:0%
support that support this legislation
 
02:28:36.550 --> 02:28:36.560 align:start position:0%
who also claim that out of state college
 
02:28:39.230 --> 02:28:39.240 align:start position:0%
students have to vote in New Hampshire
 
02:28:41.590 --> 02:28:41.600 align:start position:0%
because properly voting via absentee
 
02:28:43.349 --> 02:28:43.359 align:start position:0%
ballot in their permanent resident home
 
02:28:45.990 --> 02:28:46.000 align:start position:0%
States is just too difficult and an
 
02:28:48.630 --> 02:28:48.640 align:start position:0%
infringement on their voting rights this
 
02:28:50.630 --> 02:28:50.640 align:start position:0%
bill enables predatory Criminal to more
 
02:28:52.750 --> 02:28:52.760 align:start position:0%
easily seek out their prey knowing
 
02:28:54.590 --> 02:28:54.600 align:start position:0%
law-abiding citizens will obey this
 
02:28:57.230 --> 02:28:57.240 align:start position:0%
ridiculous gun control law this bill
 
02:28:59.910 --> 02:28:59.920 align:start position:0%
makes graned Staters less safe
 
02:29:01.790 --> 02:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
especially women who are carrying due to
 
02:29:03.630 --> 02:29:03.640 align:start position:0%
specific violent threats against their
 
02:29:06.349 --> 02:29:06.359 align:start position:0%
lives there's no problem this bill is
 
02:29:10.150 --> 02:29:10.160 align:start position:0%
trying to solve and it's ironic and
 
02:29:12.950 --> 02:29:12.960 align:start position:0%
amusing and slightly insane that
 
02:29:14.590 --> 02:29:14.600 align:start position:0%
everyone who's bringing up gun control
 
02:29:16.190 --> 02:29:16.200 align:start position:0%
laws in other states that we should
 
02:29:18.510 --> 02:29:18.520 align:start position:0%
follow those States they're bringing up
 
02:29:19.670 --> 02:29:19.680 align:start position:0%
states that are less safe than New
 
02:29:22.429 --> 02:29:22.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire New Hampshire is consistently
 
02:29:25.150 --> 02:29:25.160 align:start position:0%
the safest state in the country why we
 
02:29:26.590 --> 02:29:26.600 align:start position:0%
want to be less safe like all these
 
02:29:28.790 --> 02:29:28.800 align:start position:0%
other states is beyond me and we will
 
02:29:30.550 --> 02:29:30.560 align:start position:0%
still be that safe unless we put gun
 
02:29:32.870 --> 02:29:32.880 align:start position:0%
controls laws like this into place
 
02:29:34.750 --> 02:29:34.760 align:start position:0%
because they will make us less safe
 
02:29:36.750 --> 02:29:36.760 align:start position:0%
please vote inexpedient to legislate on
 
02:29:36.760 --> 02:29:38.870 align:start position:0%

my um colleagues is here as well uh

all day and um at the end of the night
 
02:30:41.349 --> 02:30:41.359 align:start position:0%
we count our checklist to make sure that
 
02:30:47.870 --> 02:30:47.880 align:start position:0%
it matches the um the voter machines
 
02:30:51.670 --> 02:30:51.680 align:start position:0%
um I it's very important that I need to
 
02:30:54.990 --> 02:30:55.000 align:start position:0%
ensure um the voter that they are um
 
02:30:58.510 --> 02:30:58.520 align:start position:0%
casting their vote in a safe place um
 
02:31:01.070 --> 02:31:01.080 align:start position:0%
currently uh with the situation of
 
02:31:05.309 --> 02:31:05.319 align:start position:0%
allowing guns um into our elections on
 
02:31:09.510 --> 02:31:09.520 align:start position:0%
um polling day um it provides
 
02:31:12.230 --> 02:31:12.240 align:start position:0%
intimidation and a threat to individual
 
02:31:12.240 --> 02:31:13.429 align:start position:0%
intimidation and a threat to individual
voting

02:31:13.429 --> 02:31:13.439 align:start position:0%
voting
 
02:31:15.990 --> 02:31:16.000 align:start position:0%
rights um you'll be interested to know
 
02:31:18.309 --> 02:31:18.319 align:start position:0%
that um the Secretary of State's office
 
02:31:22.510 --> 02:31:22.520 align:start position:0%
has trained us um um recently because of
 
02:31:25.750 --> 02:31:25.760 align:start position:0%
the um uh increased volatility in
 
02:31:30.590 --> 02:31:30.600 align:start position:0%
politics and elections and um um
 
02:31:32.990 --> 02:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
officials have been threatened uh
 
02:31:37.550 --> 02:31:37.560 align:start position:0%
they've trained us um at um elections to
 
02:31:39.750 --> 02:31:39.760 align:start position:0%
try to figure out ways to lower the
 
02:31:42.670 --> 02:31:42.680 align:start position:0%
temperature so that's that never
 
02:31:44.950 --> 02:31:44.960 align:start position:0%
happened before it's only happened in
 
02:31:47.670 --> 02:31:47.680 align:start position:0%
say the last five years that um we've
 
02:31:50.630 --> 02:31:50.640 align:start position:0%
been alerted to the fact that we need to
 
02:31:54.910 --> 02:31:54.920 align:start position:0%
um arm ourselves uh with words um to try
 
02:31:58.269 --> 02:31:58.279 align:start position:0%
to keep people from becoming volatile um
 
02:32:01.750 --> 02:32:01.760 align:start position:0%
we have power because we um determine
 
02:32:03.590 --> 02:32:03.600 align:start position:0%
whether someone um has the right
 
02:32:07.190 --> 02:32:07.200 align:start position:0%
credentials to vote in our in our town
 
02:32:10.309 --> 02:32:10.319 align:start position:0%
um the legislature has just made it more
 
02:32:13.429 --> 02:32:13.439 align:start position:0%
difficult because um they've taken away
 
02:32:16.349 --> 02:32:16.359 align:start position:0%
affidavits and now all documents have to
 
02:32:19.910 --> 02:32:19.920 align:start position:0%
be provided or we turn you away uh which
 
02:32:22.349 --> 02:32:22.359 align:start position:0%
to me sets up a situation where someone
 
02:32:25.830 --> 02:32:25.840 align:start position:0%
could be angry and possibly um use a
 
02:32:30.349 --> 02:32:30.359 align:start position:0%
weapon against me or any other election
 
02:32:34.349 --> 02:32:34.359 align:start position:0%
official um I support this bill HB uh
 
02:32:37.990 --> 02:32:38.000 align:start position:0%
352 because it supports the right of
 
02:32:41.910 --> 02:32:41.920 align:start position:0%
citizens to cast their ballot in a safe
 
02:32:45.469 --> 02:32:45.479 align:start position:0%
place ensuring that citizens are safely
 
02:32:49.030 --> 02:32:49.040 align:start position:0%
casting a vote supersedes the right to
 
02:32:51.469 --> 02:32:51.479 align:start position:0%
carry a gun into the
 
02:32:58.429 --> 02:32:58.439 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:07.830 --> 02:33:07.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:33:10.389 --> 02:33:10.399 align:start position:0%
blanger hello again rayel Lander from
 
02:33:13.230 --> 02:33:13.240 align:start position:0%
Tilton I'm against this bill one of the
 
02:33:15.550 --> 02:33:15.560 align:start position:0%
things that people are always zeroing in
 
02:33:18.630 --> 02:33:18.640 align:start position:0%
on is is proposing that there's some
 
02:33:20.269 --> 02:33:20.279 align:start position:0%
crazy people out there are going to go
 
02:33:22.950 --> 02:33:22.960 align:start position:0%
into a polling place and shoot it up I
 
02:33:24.510 --> 02:33:24.520 align:start position:0%
don't think there are many many people
 
02:33:26.670 --> 02:33:26.680 align:start position:0%
there that are thinking about that I'm
 
02:33:29.070 --> 02:33:29.080 align:start position:0%
not thinking about that I have to get to
 
02:33:31.230 --> 02:33:31.240 align:start position:0%
the polling place I'm getting older
 
02:33:33.389 --> 02:33:33.399 align:start position:0%
every day I don't run as fast as I could
 
02:33:36.790 --> 02:33:36.800 align:start position:0%
I'm less capable and to tell me I can't
 
02:33:39.030 --> 02:33:39.040 align:start position:0%
go vote I can't bring my gun to where
 
02:33:41.670 --> 02:33:41.680 align:start position:0%
I'm going to vote so that I'm safe on my
 
02:33:44.070 --> 02:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
way there and on my way home and in the
 
02:33:47.830 --> 02:33:47.840 align:start position:0%
parking lot which in my town is not very
 
02:33:50.870 --> 02:33:50.880 align:start position:0%
far from the bike PA which as you know
 
02:33:53.469 --> 02:33:53.479 align:start position:0%
has become a hangout for people to do
 
02:33:59.070 --> 02:33:59.080 align:start position:0%
 
02:34:01.910 --> 02:34:01.920 align:start position:0%
and you need to everyone needs to be
 
02:34:04.190 --> 02:34:04.200 align:start position:0%
safe wherever they go and in traveling
 
02:34:06.750 --> 02:34:06.760 align:start position:0%
to and from polling places is one of the
 
02:34:09.389 --> 02:34:09.399 align:start position:0%
places you should be allowed to be safe
 
02:34:13.030 --> 02:34:13.040 align:start position:0%
and if I can't bring my firearm there
 
02:34:15.389 --> 02:34:15.399 align:start position:0%
and I live in a town where I have to
 
02:34:18.790 --> 02:34:18.800 align:start position:0%
walk past some of these places you're
 
02:34:20.990 --> 02:34:21.000 align:start position:0%
taking away my right to be safe getting
 
02:34:23.670 --> 02:34:23.680 align:start position:0%
there to vote so I might some people
 
02:34:26.710 --> 02:34:26.720 align:start position:0%
might not want to go because they no
 
02:34:30.670 --> 02:34:30.680 align:start position:0%
longer feel safe getting there um I was
 
02:34:32.990 --> 02:34:33.000 align:start position:0%
glad someone mentioned that federal law
 
02:34:35.790 --> 02:34:35.800 align:start position:0%
says a person really should needs to
 
02:34:37.950 --> 02:34:37.960 align:start position:0%
have a state permit to go onto school
 
02:34:39.950 --> 02:34:39.960 align:start position:0%
grounds although no one has been
 
02:34:42.630 --> 02:34:42.640 align:start position:0%
prosecuted for walking by or being
 
02:34:44.349 --> 02:34:44.359 align:start position:0%
within 1,000
 
02:34:47.389 --> 02:34:47.399 align:start position:0%
feet it only going to take one case for
 
02:34:50.230 --> 02:34:50.240 align:start position:0%
some federal Marshal to know that
 
02:34:52.630 --> 02:34:52.640 align:start position:0%
doesn't like you or thought you
 
02:34:56.110 --> 02:34:56.120 align:start position:0%
were doing something wrong to write you
 
02:34:58.910 --> 02:34:58.920 align:start position:0%
up and arrest you for having a firearm
 
02:35:01.429 --> 02:35:01.439 align:start position:0%
so it's good to have a permit if you're
 
02:35:03.790 --> 02:35:03.800 align:start position:0%
going to go on school grounds but it's
 
02:35:06.030 --> 02:35:06.040 align:start position:0%
advertised that you don't need one
 
02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:07.800 align:start position:0%
because we're a constitutional carry
 
02:35:10.710 --> 02:35:10.720 align:start position:0%
state and I don't think that's true I
 
02:35:12.590 --> 02:35:12.600 align:start position:0%
think you could get prosecuted very
 
02:35:15.990 --> 02:35:16.000 align:start position:0%
easily for not having the permit
 
02:35:20.190 --> 02:35:20.200 align:start position:0%
um I just um
 
02:35:22.469 --> 02:35:22.479 align:start position:0%
I just think that you know it's safer
 
02:35:24.389 --> 02:35:24.399 align:start position:0%
the other thing and New Hampshire is one
 
02:35:26.750 --> 02:35:26.760 align:start position:0%
of the safest states why because no one
 
02:35:30.110 --> 02:35:30.120 align:start position:0%
knows who's carrying a firearm who isn't
 
02:35:32.830 --> 02:35:32.840 align:start position:0%
if they think that some of the pole
 
02:35:35.510 --> 02:35:35.520 align:start position:0%
workers might be carrying
 
02:35:38.830 --> 02:35:38.840 align:start position:0%
firearms um you know to help keep
 
02:35:42.230 --> 02:35:42.240 align:start position:0%
themselves safe that just makes it a a
 
02:35:45.070 --> 02:35:45.080 align:start position:0%
better thing to have that everyone can
 
02:35:47.349 --> 02:35:47.359 align:start position:0%
keep themselves safe by arming
 
02:35:49.750 --> 02:35:49.760 align:start position:0%
themselves concealed would be better I
 
02:35:52.150 --> 02:35:52.160 align:start position:0%
wouldn't never open carry but some
 
02:35:55.550 --> 02:35:55.560 align:start position:0%
people like that as a deterrent um the
 
02:35:58.830 --> 02:35:58.840 align:start position:0%
police certainly do they open carry as a
 
02:36:01.790 --> 02:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
deterrent um I would hope you would vote
 
02:36:04.510 --> 02:36:04.520 align:start position:0%
against this bill so that we can all be
 
02:36:06.790 --> 02:36:06.800 align:start position:0%
safe wherever we
 
02:36:14.830 --> 02:36:14.840 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:29.550 --> 02:36:29.560 align:start position:0%
 
02:36:33.230 --> 02:36:33.240 align:start position:0%
hello again I just wanted to um start
 
02:36:35.349 --> 02:36:35.359 align:start position:0%
off with a quote from the great
 
02:36:37.990 --> 02:36:38.000 align:start position:0%
philosopher John Loch who said
 
02:36:41.150 --> 02:36:41.160 align:start position:0%
self-defense is a part of the laws of
 
02:36:43.910 --> 02:36:43.920 align:start position:0%
nature nor can it be denied the
 
02:36:47.309 --> 02:36:47.319 align:start position:0%
community nor even against the king
 
02:36:51.349 --> 02:36:51.359 align:start position:0%
himself last year I became a Citizen and
 
02:36:54.190 --> 02:36:54.200 align:start position:0%
I was very proud to vote in my first
 
02:36:58.030 --> 02:36:58.040 align:start position:0%
primary and federal election and
 
02:36:59.870 --> 02:36:59.880 align:start position:0%
honestly sometimes I have to pinch
 
02:37:03.710 --> 02:37:03.720 align:start position:0%
myself to remember this is not a dream I
 
02:37:05.950 --> 02:37:05.960 align:start position:0%
am a citizen of the greatest nation on
 
02:37:08.830 --> 02:37:08.840 align:start position:0%
Earth and I live in arguably the
 
02:37:11.030 --> 02:37:11.040 align:start position:0%
greatest state in the nation the Live
 
02:37:14.790 --> 02:37:14.800 align:start position:0%
Free or Die state which was the first to
 
02:37:18.750 --> 02:37:18.760 align:start position:0%
recognize and protect those natural laws
 
02:37:22.190 --> 02:37:22.200 align:start position:0%
with its robust Constitution that uh led
 
02:37:25.830 --> 02:37:25.840 align:start position:0%
the way and it
 
02:37:28.590 --> 02:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
um I find it a little bit sad and
 
02:37:32.349 --> 02:37:32.359 align:start position:0%
alarming that bills like this come up to
 
02:37:35.990 --> 02:37:36.000 align:start position:0%
disarm me when I'm exercising my right
 
02:37:39.910 --> 02:37:39.920 align:start position:0%
to vote and still having to retain my
 
02:37:42.750 --> 02:37:42.760 align:start position:0%
natural right to
 
02:37:44.750 --> 02:37:44.760 align:start position:0%
self-defense um I think it's
 
02:37:46.990 --> 02:37:47.000 align:start position:0%
unconstitutional and cruel to deny me
 
02:37:49.670 --> 02:37:49.680 align:start position:0%
that right to self-defense
 
02:37:52.870 --> 02:37:52.880 align:start position:0%
um I think gun-free zones are cruel as
 
02:37:55.110 --> 02:37:55.120 align:start position:0%
well um I'm quite sure that fish in a
 
02:37:57.990 --> 02:37:58.000 align:start position:0%
barrel feel very very safe but if you
 
02:37:59.910 --> 02:37:59.920 align:start position:0%
think about it you know they're
 
02:38:03.269 --> 02:38:03.279 align:start position:0%
not uh a bill like this in my opinion
 
02:38:07.790 --> 02:38:07.800 align:start position:0%
would increase um the chance if any of
 
02:38:09.950 --> 02:38:09.960 align:start position:0%
uh violent incidents at a poing place by
 
02:38:12.510 --> 02:38:12.520 align:start position:0%
essentially putting a metaphorical neon
 
02:38:16.349 --> 02:38:16.359 align:start position:0%
sign saying unarmed citizens
 
02:38:19.950 --> 02:38:19.960 align:start position:0%
inside uh I would suggest a reverse
 
02:38:24.950 --> 02:38:24.960 align:start position:0%
of this bill to have a condition made
 
02:38:28.469 --> 02:38:28.479 align:start position:0%
for um the paranoid Among Us who would
 
02:38:30.950 --> 02:38:30.960 align:start position:0%
like to stay home While others are
 
02:38:33.870 --> 02:38:33.880 align:start position:0%
exercising their natural right that they
 
02:38:38.230 --> 02:38:38.240 align:start position:0%
should be able to uh vote by absentee so
 
02:38:41.990 --> 02:38:42.000 align:start position:0%
that um they feel safe and the rest of
 
02:38:46.110 --> 02:38:46.120 align:start position:0%
us live free and so I would ask you to
 
02:38:49.950 --> 02:38:49.960 align:start position:0%
um to object to this bill on those on
 
02:38:53.389 --> 02:38:53.399 align:start position:0%
those accounts thank you thank you for
 
02:38:53.399 --> 02:38:55.950 align:start position:0%
those accounts thank you thank you for
your

02:38:55.950 --> 02:38:55.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:06.990 --> 02:39:07.000 align:start position:0%
 
02:39:09.269 --> 02:39:09.279 align:start position:0%
Davis honorable members of the committee
 
02:39:11.030 --> 02:39:11.040 align:start position:0%
my name is Justin Davis I serve as a New
 
02:39:12.750 --> 02:39:12.760 align:start position:0%
Hampshire state director and I'm a New
 
02:39:14.389 --> 02:39:14.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire resident a lot of this been
 
02:39:15.590 --> 02:39:15.600 align:start position:0%
covered already I know it's going to be
 
02:39:16.950 --> 02:39:16.960 align:start position:0%
a long day so I'll try to make this
 
02:39:20.469 --> 02:39:20.479 align:start position:0%
brief um as as previously mentioned um
 
02:39:22.030 --> 02:39:22.040 align:start position:0%
this would create soft several soft
 
02:39:24.070 --> 02:39:24.080 align:start position:0%
several hundred soft targets throughout
 
02:39:27.429 --> 02:39:27.439 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire uh with no mandate for
 
02:39:30.190 --> 02:39:30.200 align:start position:0%
protection from police from mag Pond
 
02:39:32.230 --> 02:39:32.240 align:start position:0%
from mag uh from mags to make sure that
 
02:39:33.750 --> 02:39:33.760 align:start position:0%
there's nobody coming in uh with
 
02:39:35.550 --> 02:39:35.560 align:start position:0%
Firearms if they're supposed to be
 
02:39:37.670 --> 02:39:37.680 align:start position:0%
so-called gun-free zones um as we've
 
02:39:39.510 --> 02:39:39.520 align:start position:0%
seen since 1950 from the crime
 
02:39:42.070 --> 02:39:42.080 align:start position:0%
prevention center 94% of mass shootings
 
02:39:44.110 --> 02:39:44.120 align:start position:0%
have happened in gun-free zones so we're
 
02:39:45.670 --> 02:39:45.680 align:start position:0%
making a very dangerous scenario for
 
02:39:46.870 --> 02:39:46.880 align:start position:0%
people who are looking to vote on
 
02:39:48.870 --> 02:39:48.880 align:start position:0%
Election Day and I've heard a lot about
 
02:39:50.590 --> 02:39:50.600 align:start position:0%
talk about intimidation and and saying
 
02:39:52.870 --> 02:39:52.880 align:start position:0%
that folks who uh carry firearms will
 
02:39:54.710 --> 02:39:54.720 align:start position:0%
intimidate folks who don't well we're
 
02:39:56.110 --> 02:39:56.120 align:start position:0%
not thinking about the pole workers who
 
02:39:57.710 --> 02:39:57.720 align:start position:0%
carry firearms because they want they
 
02:39:58.910 --> 02:39:58.920 align:start position:0%
want to feel comfortable right maybe
 
02:40:00.389 --> 02:40:00.399 align:start position:0%
they feel intimidated to go out to vote
 
02:40:01.670 --> 02:40:01.680 align:start position:0%
or be a pole worker without their
 
02:40:03.750 --> 02:40:03.760 align:start position:0%
firearm what about individuals who are
 
02:40:05.349 --> 02:40:05.359 align:start position:0%
sexual assault survivors who don't feel
 
02:40:06.510 --> 02:40:06.520 align:start position:0%
comfortable leaving their home without
 
02:40:08.469 --> 02:40:08.479 align:start position:0%
their firearm and now they're forced to
 
02:40:09.870 --> 02:40:09.880 align:start position:0%
use an absentee voting system which they
 
02:40:11.309 --> 02:40:11.319 align:start position:0%
may not feel comfortable with as we've
 
02:40:13.510 --> 02:40:13.520 align:start position:0%
seen over the last several years a lot
 
02:40:15.389 --> 02:40:15.399 align:start position:0%
of people have addressed concerns about
 
02:40:17.550 --> 02:40:17.560 align:start position:0%
the absente voting system um whether
 
02:40:18.910 --> 02:40:18.920 align:start position:0%
whether those are true or not that's not
 
02:40:20.750 --> 02:40:20.760 align:start position:0%
for me to to say but that uh that
 
02:40:23.469 --> 02:40:23.479 align:start position:0%
concern does exist so uh the NRA
 
02:40:25.429 --> 02:40:25.439 align:start position:0%
strongly supports your uh or urges you
 
02:40:27.269 --> 02:40:27.279 align:start position:0%
to vote against this measure and I'm
 
02:40:30.830 --> 02:40:30.840 align:start position:0%
happy to take any questions you may
 
02:40:34.269 --> 02:40:34.279 align:start position:0%
have seeing none thank you for
 
02:40:44.950 --> 02:40:44.960 align:start position:0%
 
02:40:47.910 --> 02:40:47.920 align:start position:0%
Hannon good afternoon uh Joe Hannon gers
 
02:40:49.870 --> 02:40:49.880 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire again um we're
 
02:40:52.910 --> 02:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
obviously in opposition to this bill 352
 
02:40:55.750 --> 02:40:55.760 align:start position:0%
we'd ask you to itl it um this is a
 
02:40:57.790 --> 02:40:57.800 align:start position:0%
Firearms owner disenfranchisement bill
 
02:41:00.309 --> 02:41:00.319 align:start position:0%
this is basically saying that you know
 
02:41:02.269 --> 02:41:02.279 align:start position:0%
you're not welcome here uh they have a
 
02:41:03.870 --> 02:41:03.880 align:start position:0%
workaround which is great and I think
 
02:41:05.469 --> 02:41:05.479 align:start position:0%
it's nice that they've tried to include
 
02:41:07.510 --> 02:41:07.520 align:start position:0%
Firearms owners in a protected class of
 
02:41:09.389 --> 02:41:09.399 align:start position:0%
people that are considered uh to be
 
02:41:11.230 --> 02:41:11.240 align:start position:0%
unable to vote for religious reasons
 
02:41:12.790 --> 02:41:12.800 align:start position:0%
disability reasons or employment
 
02:41:14.630 --> 02:41:14.640 align:start position:0%
obligations so I don't know if that was
 
02:41:16.469 --> 02:41:16.479 align:start position:0%
the implication but it's an interesting
 
02:41:18.190 --> 02:41:18.200 align:start position:0%
little tidbit that was put in there and
 
02:41:20.710 --> 02:41:20.720 align:start position:0%
um anyway I just thought I'd mention
 
02:41:23.190 --> 02:41:23.200 align:start position:0%
that um also loading and unloading a
 
02:41:25.070 --> 02:41:25.080 align:start position:0%
firearm in a in a parking lot or vehicle
 
02:41:27.309 --> 02:41:27.319 align:start position:0%
is an inherently more risky Behavior
 
02:41:29.150 --> 02:41:29.160 align:start position:0%
than keeping it holstered and walking in
 
02:41:32.510 --> 02:41:32.520 align:start position:0%
with it um accidents can happen and I
 
02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:33.760 align:start position:0%
think that the worst place to do that is
 
02:41:35.429 --> 02:41:35.439 align:start position:0%
in a crowded area like a school parking
 
02:41:37.269 --> 02:41:37.279 align:start position:0%
lot or a municipal building's parking
 
02:41:39.790 --> 02:41:39.800 align:start position:0%
lot somewhere uh we've heard that it's
 
02:41:41.309 --> 02:41:41.319 align:start position:0%
also a danger that people can get be
 
02:41:43.590 --> 02:41:43.600 align:start position:0%
more likely to have a firearm stolen um
 
02:41:45.269 --> 02:41:45.279 align:start position:0%
during those situations I had a firearm
 
02:41:47.510 --> 02:41:47.520 align:start position:0%
stolen from a vehicle many years ago uh
 
02:41:49.230 --> 02:41:49.240 align:start position:0%
in Florida person that stole it was
 
02:41:51.230 --> 02:41:51.240 align:start position:0%
felon sold it to another known felon
 
02:41:53.030 --> 02:41:53.040 align:start position:0%
luckily they arrested him contacted me
 
02:41:54.750 --> 02:41:54.760 align:start position:0%
and were able to to fix the situation he
 
02:41:56.190 --> 02:41:56.200 align:start position:0%
spent 5 years in jail because it was a
 
02:41:58.269 --> 02:41:58.279 align:start position:0%
mandatory minimum uh when he was
 
02:41:59.510 --> 02:41:59.520 align:start position:0%
released from jail they let me know that
 
02:42:01.190 --> 02:42:01.200 align:start position:0%
he was out just because I may be
 
02:42:03.230 --> 02:42:03.240 align:start position:0%
concerned uh that someone I had put in
 
02:42:05.190 --> 02:42:05.200 align:start position:0%
jail for 5 years might not be happy with
 
02:42:07.910 --> 02:42:07.920 align:start position:0%
me um if this passed he'd know that I
 
02:42:09.510 --> 02:42:09.520 align:start position:0%
can go to the polls one day and I'd be a
 
02:42:11.750 --> 02:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
good Target that day but anyway this is
 
02:42:13.830 --> 02:42:13.840 align:start position:0%
also a ban on workers from being able to
 
02:42:15.710 --> 02:42:15.720 align:start position:0%
defend themselves so we heard pole
 
02:42:17.790 --> 02:42:17.800 align:start position:0%
workers talking about it um there is
 
02:42:19.910 --> 02:42:19.920 align:start position:0%
often a police officer or at different
 
02:42:21.230 --> 02:42:21.240 align:start position:0%
polling places and I understand that
 
02:42:22.590 --> 02:42:22.600 align:start position:0%
people think that's enough of a
 
02:42:25.389 --> 02:42:25.399 align:start position:0%
deterrent um it may be in some instances
 
02:42:27.309 --> 02:42:27.319 align:start position:0%
to deter some people from committing
 
02:42:30.389 --> 02:42:30.399 align:start position:0%
crimes but um they may not always be
 
02:42:32.110 --> 02:42:32.120 align:start position:0%
there they may be the first person shot
 
02:42:33.950 --> 02:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
who was the second person shot I don't
 
02:42:37.870 --> 02:42:37.880 align:start position:0%
want to be that second person um and the
 
02:42:39.349 --> 02:42:39.359 align:start position:0%
other thing this bill does is it simply
 
02:42:40.790 --> 02:42:40.800 align:start position:0%
intends to make the presence of a
 
02:42:43.429 --> 02:42:43.439 align:start position:0%
firearm whether visible or not an actual
 
02:42:45.990 --> 02:42:46.000 align:start position:0%
threat or a crime it's not it's a legal
 
02:42:48.150 --> 02:42:48.160 align:start position:0%
activity no one has hurt anybody else if
 
02:42:50.110 --> 02:42:50.120 align:start position:0%
someone is threatening menacing or
 
02:42:51.630 --> 02:42:51.640 align:start position:0%
trying to prevent someone from voting
 
02:42:52.870 --> 02:42:52.880 align:start position:0%
those are all crimes and they're all
 
02:42:55.550 --> 02:42:55.560 align:start position:0%
enforceable in New Hampshire and I don't
 
02:42:58.190 --> 02:42:58.200 align:start position:0%
believe anyone has had uh any major
 
02:43:00.590 --> 02:43:00.600 align:start position:0%
difficulty getting those those laws
 
02:43:03.349 --> 02:43:03.359 align:start position:0%
enforced um almost
 
02:43:07.710 --> 02:43:07.720 align:start position:0%
done um this does make it a misdemeanor
 
02:43:09.670 --> 02:43:09.680 align:start position:0%
to do so uh if someone is willing to
 
02:43:11.590 --> 02:43:11.600 align:start position:0%
commit a felony in all these other
 
02:43:12.830 --> 02:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
instances I don't see how this
 
02:43:15.269 --> 02:43:15.279 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor is going to stop them from
 
02:43:17.710 --> 02:43:17.720 align:start position:0%
uh committing felonies or committing
 
02:43:19.910 --> 02:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
severe VI some major violence and other
 
02:43:22.429 --> 02:43:22.439 align:start position:0%
issues uh when you sign the form or you
 
02:43:23.950 --> 02:43:23.960 align:start position:0%
check off the box to get your absentee
 
02:43:26.590 --> 02:43:26.600 align:start position:0%
ballot to be eligible says I'm
 
02:43:28.910 --> 02:43:28.920 align:start position:0%
unwilling or unable to comply with the
 
02:43:30.190 --> 02:43:30.200 align:start position:0%
prohibition of firearms at polling
 
02:43:32.389 --> 02:43:32.399 align:start position:0%
places so you're basically admitting I'm
 
02:43:35.750 --> 02:43:35.760 align:start position:0%
a problem I can't do this that may not
 
02:43:37.349 --> 02:43:37.359 align:start position:0%
be a problem with the current government
 
02:43:39.349 --> 02:43:39.359 align:start position:0%
even the people in you know future
 
02:43:41.870 --> 02:43:41.880 align:start position:0%
governments but what if there's a future
 
02:43:44.710 --> 02:43:44.720 align:start position:0%
totalitarian government or regime that
 
02:43:46.790 --> 02:43:46.800 align:start position:0%
finds that people who checked that box
 
02:43:48.230 --> 02:43:48.240 align:start position:0%
may be people they don't like very much
 
02:43:50.910 --> 02:43:50.920 align:start position:0%
now you're on an enemy list it becomes a
 
02:43:53.349 --> 02:43:53.359 align:start position:0%
registration problem um with people that
 
02:43:55.910 --> 02:43:55.920 align:start position:0%
are in these special categories
 
02:43:58.670 --> 02:43:58.680 align:start position:0%
um anyway people are innocent till
 
02:44:00.590 --> 02:44:00.600 align:start position:0%
proven guilty and this is basically
 
02:44:01.790 --> 02:44:01.800 align:start position:0%
making criminals out of people who have
 
02:44:03.590 --> 02:44:03.600 align:start position:0%
not committed a crime and I ask you to
 
02:44:05.309 --> 02:44:05.319 align:start position:0%
please itl this
 
02:44:07.510 --> 02:44:07.520 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you for your
 
02:44:10.750 --> 02:44:10.760 align:start position:0%
testimony happy to take any or none no
 
02:44:30.670 --> 02:44:30.680 align:start position:0%
 
02:44:32.550 --> 02:44:32.560 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chairman and members
 
02:44:33.910 --> 02:44:33.920 align:start position:0%
of the
 
02:44:37.870 --> 02:44:37.880 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Jay simkin I reside
 
02:44:40.150 --> 02:44:40.160 align:start position:0%
in Nash New Hampshire I've been a
 
02:44:42.389 --> 02:44:42.399 align:start position:0%
federal firearms license for something
 
02:44:44.070 --> 02:44:44.080 align:start position:0%
over 40
 
02:44:46.950 --> 02:44:46.960 align:start position:0%
years I'm also an international economic
 
02:44:49.790 --> 02:44:49.800 align:start position:0%
consultant so data have meaning
 
02:44:51.150 --> 02:44:51.160 align:start position:0%
in the
 
02:44:54.990 --> 02:44:55.000 align:start position:0%
data that I submitted with my testimony
 
02:44:59.429 --> 02:44:59.439 align:start position:0%
on House Bill 56 that has been
 
02:45:02.710 --> 02:45:02.720 align:start position:0%
heard I pointed out and I repeat here
 
02:45:05.070 --> 02:45:05.080 align:start position:0%
for the sake of good order that since
 
02:45:08.030 --> 02:45:08.040 align:start position:0%
2015 the incidence of violent crime in
 
02:45:11.230 --> 02:45:11.240 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire has declined year after
 
02:45:13.990 --> 02:45:14.000 align:start position:0%
year even during the pandemic when the
 
02:45:16.469 --> 02:45:16.479 align:start position:0%
incidents of violent crime Rose in many
 
02:45:19.429 --> 02:45:19.439 align:start position:0%
states it continued to fall here it
 
02:45:22.510 --> 02:45:22.520 align:start position:0%
continued to fall even after we
 
02:45:27.750 --> 02:45:27.760 align:start position:0%
eliminated compulsory lure for concealed
 
02:45:30.349 --> 02:45:30.359 align:start position:0%
carry so there is something different
 
02:45:32.990 --> 02:45:33.000 align:start position:0%
about New Hampshire relative to other
 
02:45:35.990 --> 02:45:36.000 align:start position:0%
states and that makes a little less
 
02:45:39.230 --> 02:45:39.240 align:start position:0%
relevant at very least what occurs in
 
02:45:43.750 --> 02:45:43.760 align:start position:0%
other states New Hampshire based on 22
 
02:45:49.110 --> 02:45:49.120 align:start position:0%
2022 data published by the FBI is the
 
02:45:52.110 --> 02:45:52.120 align:start position:0%
second safest state in the Union Maine
 
02:45:54.550 --> 02:45:54.560 align:start position:0%
has been the safest state in the Union
 
02:45:56.230 --> 02:45:56.240 align:start position:0%
at least since
 
02:45:59.510 --> 02:45:59.520 align:start position:0%
2001 that doesn't show any signs of
 
02:46:03.110 --> 02:46:03.120 align:start position:0%
changing so if there is a problem with
 
02:46:06.070 --> 02:46:06.080 align:start position:0%
pulling Place security the proper
 
02:46:09.830 --> 02:46:09.840 align:start position:0%
response is for this great house to
 
02:46:13.510 --> 02:46:13.520 align:start position:0%
legislate that security be provided for
 
02:46:13.520 --> 02:46:15.830 align:start position:0%
legislate that security be provided for
polling

02:46:15.830 --> 02:46:15.840 align:start position:0%
polling
 
02:46:19.469 --> 02:46:19.479 align:start position:0%
places the fact that no violent
 
02:46:22.269 --> 02:46:22.279 align:start position:0%
act has occurred at a polling place
 
02:46:25.429 --> 02:46:25.439 align:start position:0%
isn't probative but it's indicative that
 
02:46:27.790 --> 02:46:27.800 align:start position:0%
it's not likely but the likelihood isn't
 
02:46:32.710 --> 02:46:32.720 align:start position:0%
zero it's low so if you and your
 
02:46:36.230 --> 02:46:36.240 align:start position:0%
colleagues in this great house believe
 
02:46:38.469 --> 02:46:38.479 align:start position:0%
that there is a real risk of violence at
 
02:46:42.710 --> 02:46:42.720 align:start position:0%
polling places appropriate money for
 
02:46:47.710 --> 02:46:47.720 align:start position:0%
towns and cities to higher security one
 
02:46:50.110 --> 02:46:50.120 align:start position:0%
other point
 
02:46:53.790 --> 02:46:53.800 align:start position:0%
if you had before you an official of the
 
02:46:56.389 --> 02:46:56.399 align:start position:0%
US Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco firearms
 
02:46:59.590 --> 02:46:59.600 align:start position:0%
and explosives I'm pretty confident
 
02:47:04.429 --> 02:47:04.439 align:start position:0%
about 99% so that they would strongly
 
02:47:07.750 --> 02:47:07.760 align:start position:0%
recommend against leaving firearms in
 
02:47:11.070 --> 02:47:11.080 align:start position:0%
vehicles vehicles are a major
 
02:47:14.510 --> 02:47:14.520 align:start position:0%
source of firearms for
 
02:47:17.550 --> 02:47:17.560 align:start position:0%
criminals most of you have probably read
 
02:47:20.990 --> 02:47:21.000 align:start position:0%
that cars have been sto that had infants
 
02:47:24.429 --> 02:47:24.439 align:start position:0%
in the back seat and the thief intent on
 
02:47:26.269 --> 02:47:26.279 align:start position:0%
making off with the vehicle didn't
 
02:47:28.830 --> 02:47:28.840 align:start position:0%
notice the
 
02:47:32.309 --> 02:47:32.319 align:start position:0%
child that alone should be warning
 
02:47:34.870 --> 02:47:34.880 align:start position:0%
sufficient that encouraging folks to
 
02:47:37.469 --> 02:47:37.479 align:start position:0%
leave firearms and vehicles is a really
 
02:47:40.710 --> 02:47:40.720 align:start position:0%
bad idea and simply should not be done
 
02:47:45.030 --> 02:47:45.040 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr simin I'm happy to take any

I'm opening the public he on Hospital 56
 
03:30:03.429 --> 03:30:03.439 align:start position:0%
and invite the prime sponsor to
 
03:30:07.110 --> 03:30:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:09.910 --> 03:30:09.920 align:start position:0%
Bill thank you Mr chairman and members
 
03:30:11.870 --> 03:30:11.880 align:start position:0%
of the committee happy to be here this
 
03:30:14.469 --> 03:30:14.479 align:start position:0%
afternoon to present this bill uh this
 
03:30:15.990 --> 03:30:16.000 align:start position:0%
will be one of several of my bills that
 
03:30:18.550 --> 03:30:18.560 align:start position:0%
due to some Nuance probably wound up in
 
03:30:19.790 --> 03:30:19.800 align:start position:0%
maybe the second or third most
 
03:30:21.590 --> 03:30:21.600 align:start position:0%
appropriate committee however I don't
 
03:30:23.189 --> 03:30:23.199 align:start position:0%
doubt your qualifications to hear it and
 
03:30:25.349 --> 03:30:25.359 align:start position:0%
I hope you'll come away in agreement
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
with the purpose of this bill so while
 
03:30:30.750 --> 03:30:30.760 align:start position:0%
at first glance this appears to be a
 
03:30:33.710 --> 03:30:33.720 align:start position:0%
simple Firearms nullification bill it is
 
03:30:36.670 --> 03:30:36.680 align:start position:0%
not in fact that uh it's much more than
 
03:30:39.429 --> 03:30:39.439 align:start position:0%
that despite the misleading title you
 
03:30:41.750 --> 03:30:41.760 align:start position:0%
will not find reference to the National
 
03:30:44.469 --> 03:30:44.479 align:start position:0%
Firearms Act anywhere in this bill
 
03:30:46.030 --> 03:30:46.040 align:start position:0%
that's because this bill is not about
 
03:30:48.110 --> 03:30:48.120 align:start position:0%
the NFA nor is it really about
 
03:30:50.150 --> 03:30:50.160 align:start position:0%
nullification and interposition now
 
03:30:53.070 --> 03:30:53.080 align:start position:0%
don't get me wrong I like James Madison
 
03:30:55.550 --> 03:30:55.560 align:start position:0%
am a major proponent of the doctrine of
 
03:30:58.670 --> 03:30:58.680 align:start position:0%
nullification and interposition however
 
03:31:01.670 --> 03:31:01.680 align:start position:0%
this bill is designed from top to bottom
 
03:31:05.630 --> 03:31:05.640 align:start position:0%
to elicit a specific legal challenge in
 
03:31:08.309 --> 03:31:08.319 align:start position:0%
the federal courts by drawing a federal
 
03:31:11.309 --> 03:31:11.319 align:start position:0%
lawsuit under the supremacy
 
03:31:13.710 --> 03:31:13.720 align:start position:0%
clause I make this challenge because I
 
03:31:15.189 --> 03:31:15.199 align:start position:0%
believe for the first time in many
 
03:31:15.199 --> 03:31:16.670 align:start position:0%
believe for the first time in many
generations

03:31:16.670 --> 03:31:16.680 align:start position:0%
generations
 
03:31:18.870 --> 03:31:18.880 align:start position:0%
the present composition of the Supreme
 
03:31:22.030 --> 03:31:22.040 align:start position:0%
Court might be such that they have the
 
03:31:24.670 --> 03:31:24.680 align:start position:0%
guts to overturn the worst decision in
 
03:31:26.990 --> 03:31:27.000 align:start position:0%
the history of the United
 
03:31:29.750 --> 03:31:29.760 align:start position:0%
States the Commerce Clause of the United
 
03:31:32.510 --> 03:31:32.520 align:start position:0%
States Constitution reads to regulate
 
03:31:34.870 --> 03:31:34.880 align:start position:0%
commerce with foreign Nations and among
 
03:31:37.349 --> 03:31:37.359 align:start position:0%
the several States and with the Indian
 
03:31:39.990 --> 03:31:40.000 align:start position:0%
tribes this is the provision that
 
03:31:41.670 --> 03:31:41.680 align:start position:0%
authorizes the federal government to
 
03:31:41.680 --> 03:31:42.950 align:start position:0%
authorizes the federal government to
regulate

03:31:42.950 --> 03:31:42.960 align:start position:0%
regulate
 
03:31:45.309 --> 03:31:45.319 align:start position:0%
commerce initially this Clause was
 
03:31:47.910 --> 03:31:47.920 align:start position:0%
interpreted properly and narrowly to
 
03:31:49.750 --> 03:31:49.760 align:start position:0%
suggest that the federal government had
 
03:31:52.469 --> 03:31:52.479 align:start position:0%
the authority to regulate interstate
 
03:31:55.469 --> 03:31:55.479 align:start position:0%
commerce as trade between states in the
 
03:31:58.189 --> 03:31:58.199 align:start position:0%
time since the federal Judiciary has
 
03:32:00.349 --> 03:32:00.359 align:start position:0%
repeatedly expanded on this
 
03:32:03.469 --> 03:32:03.479 align:start position:0%
interpretation and seized Powers not
 
03:32:06.150 --> 03:32:06.160 align:start position:0%
delegated to it under the
 
03:32:08.750 --> 03:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
Constitution while initially a measure
 
03:32:11.710 --> 03:32:11.720 align:start position:0%
to break down trade barriers such as the
 
03:32:14.790 --> 03:32:14.800 align:start position:0%
levying of tariffs by one State against
 
03:32:17.790 --> 03:32:17.800 align:start position:0%
another state in a protectionist manner
 
03:32:20.750 --> 03:32:20.760 align:start position:0%
this expansive understanding over the
 
03:32:23.189 --> 03:32:23.199 align:start position:0%
centuries has come
 
03:32:25.630 --> 03:32:25.640 align:start position:0%
to provide the federal government with
 
03:32:28.269 --> 03:32:28.279 align:start position:0%
the authority to tell a farmer within
 
03:32:31.030 --> 03:32:31.040 align:start position:0%
our state that he cannot grow more than
 
03:32:33.110 --> 03:32:33.120 align:start position:0%
a certain amount of grain on his own
 
03:32:35.670 --> 03:32:35.680 align:start position:0%
land for his own personal consumption
 
03:32:37.389 --> 03:32:37.399 align:start position:0%
and in support of his own
 
03:32:40.189 --> 03:32:40.199 align:start position:0%
livestock this is the result of a series
 
03:32:42.510 --> 03:32:42.520 align:start position:0%
of Supreme Court opinions reminiscent of
 
03:32:45.309 --> 03:32:45.319 align:start position:0%
Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon where if you
 
03:32:47.830 --> 03:32:47.840 align:start position:0%
can establish L any link no matter how
 
03:32:51.030 --> 03:32:51.040 align:start position:0%
tenuous to trade between states then
 
03:32:53.870 --> 03:32:53.880 align:start position:0%
Congress can regulate it this is not an
 
03:32:56.269 --> 03:32:56.279 align:start position:0%
exaggeration this was the exact subject
 
03:32:59.870 --> 03:32:59.880 align:start position:0%
of the lawsuit wicker versus filburn of
 
03:33:02.349 --> 03:33:02.359 align:start position:0%
1942 where the federal government shut
 
03:33:04.550 --> 03:33:04.560 align:start position:0%
down the operations of a private farmer
 
03:33:06.990 --> 03:33:07.000 align:start position:0%
and land owner growing wheat on his own
 
03:33:09.150 --> 03:33:09.160 align:start position:0%
land for his own personal
 
03:33:12.189 --> 03:33:12.199 align:start position:0%
use they established this authority to
 
03:33:14.469 --> 03:33:14.479 align:start position:0%
regulate under the following leaps of
 
03:33:19.389 --> 03:33:19.399 align:start position:0%
logic wheat grown privately for use on
 
03:33:22.389 --> 03:33:22.399 align:start position:0%
someone's own land means that the same
 
03:33:23.389 --> 03:33:23.399 align:start position:0%
amount of
 
03:33:26.309 --> 03:33:26.319 align:start position:0%
wheat which would otherwise be purchased
 
03:33:30.150 --> 03:33:30.160 align:start position:0%
at Market no longer has to be
 
03:33:32.590 --> 03:33:32.600 align:start position:0%
purchased which has some immeasurable
 
03:33:35.269 --> 03:33:35.279 align:start position:0%
effect on the economy of Wheat by
 
03:33:38.750 --> 03:33:38.760 align:start position:0%
reducing Demand on the market and the
 
03:33:41.070 --> 03:33:41.080 align:start position:0%
wheat Market is a national Market
 
03:33:44.070 --> 03:33:44.080 align:start position:0%
existing between states and therefore
 
03:33:46.110 --> 03:33:46.120 align:start position:0%
this private activity of growing weed on
 
03:33:48.550 --> 03:33:48.560 align:start position:0%
your own land for your own use can be
 
03:33:51.790 --> 03:33:51.800 align:start position:0%
regulated under the Commerce
 
03:33:55.349 --> 03:33:55.359 align:start position:0%
Clause under this awful phenomenological
 
03:33:58.030 --> 03:33:58.040 align:start position:0%
approach quite literally anything at all
 
03:33:59.990 --> 03:34:00.000 align:start position:0%
could be regulated by the federal
 
03:34:02.710 --> 03:34:02.720 align:start position:0%
government under the the Commerce Clause
 
03:34:04.670 --> 03:34:04.680 align:start position:0%
in the modern world that would give the
 
03:34:06.870 --> 03:34:06.880 align:start position:0%
authority over things such as 3D
 
03:34:09.309 --> 03:34:09.319 align:start position:0%
printing at home or knitting a child
 
03:34:11.750 --> 03:34:11.760 align:start position:0%
your hat a hat for your own child
 
03:34:14.590 --> 03:34:14.600 align:start position:0%
because doing so affects the marketplace
 
03:34:16.830 --> 03:34:16.840 align:start position:0%
broadly by reducing ing
 
03:34:19.030 --> 03:34:19.040 align:start position:0%
demand this is not what the founders
 
03:34:22.429 --> 03:34:22.439 align:start position:0%
intended we can know this firmly as they
 
03:34:25.189 --> 03:34:25.199 align:start position:0%
use the word among the states to
 
03:34:27.830 --> 03:34:27.840 align:start position:0%
represent interstate commerce not the
 
03:34:30.590 --> 03:34:30.600 align:start position:0%
word within the states which would have
 
03:34:32.229 --> 03:34:32.239 align:start position:0%
given them the authority to regulate
 
03:34:34.510 --> 03:34:34.520 align:start position:0%
commerce within a
 
03:34:37.590 --> 03:34:37.600 align:start position:0%
state this Supreme Court decision was
 
03:34:39.710 --> 03:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
perhaps the most consequential and
 
03:34:42.229 --> 03:34:42.239 align:start position:0%
terrible overreach in all of American
 
03:34:45.229 --> 03:34:45.239 align:start position:0%
History this decision robbed the states
 
03:34:47.670 --> 03:34:47.680 align:start position:0%
of sovereignty and their elected
 
03:34:50.150 --> 03:34:50.160 align:start position:0%
representatives that would be us of the
 
03:34:53.150 --> 03:34:53.160 align:start position:0%
power to craft just laws regulating or
 
03:34:55.670 --> 03:34:55.680 align:start position:0%
deregulating Commerce within their own
 
03:34:58.429 --> 03:34:58.439 align:start position:0%
borders it was a death below to the
 
03:35:00.790 --> 03:35:00.800 align:start position:0%
already wounded concept of the United
 
03:35:03.950 --> 03:35:03.960 align:start position:0%
States as a federal republic and serve
 
03:35:06.150 --> 03:35:06.160 align:start position:0%
to significantly transition our form of
 
03:35:08.229 --> 03:35:08.239 align:start position:0%
government toward a progressive
 
03:35:10.830 --> 03:35:10.840 align:start position:0%
democracy so this bill is not really
 
03:35:14.189 --> 03:35:14.199 align:start position:0%
about Firearms at heart this bill is
 
03:35:16.030 --> 03:35:16.040 align:start position:0%
about giving our current courts another
 
03:35:18.870 --> 03:35:18.880 align:start position:0%
bite at this apple and an opportunity to
 
03:35:22.429 --> 03:35:22.439 align:start position:0%
write a rather large historical wrong
 
03:35:25.150 --> 03:35:25.160 align:start position:0%
should this be successful and result in
 
03:35:27.870 --> 03:35:27.880 align:start position:0%
an overturning of wicker or a narrowing
 
03:35:29.389 --> 03:35:29.399 align:start position:0%
of the interpretation of the Commerce
 
03:35:31.710 --> 03:35:31.720 align:start position:0%
Clause the results for this and every
 
03:35:33.830 --> 03:35:33.840 align:start position:0%
other state in the Union would be so
 
03:35:36.110 --> 03:35:36.120 align:start position:0%
meaningful for
 
03:35:38.870 --> 03:35:38.880 align:start position:0%
federalism it would go a long way toward
 
03:35:41.309 --> 03:35:41.319 align:start position:0%
restoring the founding vision of America
 
03:35:43.670 --> 03:35:43.680 align:start position:0%
as a Federation of
 
03:35:46.229 --> 03:35:46.239 align:start position:0%
republics it would allow economic
 
03:35:47.630 --> 03:35:47.640 align:start position:0%
activity to
 
03:35:50.510 --> 03:35:50.520 align:start position:0%
Boom it would put our Troublesome
 
03:35:53.870 --> 03:35:53.880 align:start position:0%
Federal bureaucracy back in a box such
 
03:35:55.389 --> 03:35:55.399 align:start position:0%
that the average New Hampshire citizen
 
03:35:56.870 --> 03:35:56.880 align:start position:0%
doesn't have to worry about their
 
03:35:58.590 --> 03:35:58.600 align:start position:0%
quirkiness because it just doesn't
 
03:36:00.110 --> 03:36:00.120 align:start position:0%
affect them that
 
03:36:03.070 --> 03:36:03.080 align:start position:0%
much and with that I'm happy to take
 
03:36:06.590 --> 03:36:06.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you are you aware of any
 
03:36:08.229 --> 03:36:08.239 align:start position:0%
other cases that are in the pipeline
 
03:36:10.229 --> 03:36:10.239 align:start position:0%
that are going to challenge that
 
03:36:12.830 --> 03:36:12.840 align:start position:0%
ruling presently I'm not aware of any
 
03:36:14.349 --> 03:36:14.359 align:start position:0%
challenges to the Commerce Clause that
 
03:36:17.469 --> 03:36:17.479 align:start position:0%
are pending okay and can you explain how
 
03:36:19.590 --> 03:36:19.600 align:start position:0%
this bill if enacted would trigger such
 
03:36:23.229 --> 03:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
a lawsuit yes so what it almost
 
03:36:25.389 --> 03:36:25.399 align:start position:0%
certainly would happen because this
 
03:36:29.630 --> 03:36:29.640 align:start position:0%
specifically seeks to exempt um certain
 
03:36:31.189 --> 03:36:31.199 align:start position:0%
Manufacturing in the state of New
 
03:36:34.790 --> 03:36:34.800 align:start position:0%
Hampshire from federal oversight this
 
03:36:37.590 --> 03:36:37.600 align:start position:0%
would trigger a lawsuit against the
 
03:36:39.070 --> 03:36:39.080 align:start position:0%
state by the federal government under
 
03:36:41.229 --> 03:36:41.239 align:start position:0%
the supremacy clause which opens the
 
03:36:43.389 --> 03:36:43.399 align:start position:0%
door to the state and under the current
 
03:36:45.830 --> 03:36:45.840 align:start position:0%
um circumstances in America I believe we
 
03:36:48.389 --> 03:36:48.399 align:start position:0%
would be joined by many other states in
 
03:36:50.150 --> 03:36:50.160 align:start position:0%
arguing for a restricting of the
 
03:36:53.630 --> 03:36:53.640 align:start position:0%
definition of uh the Commerce Clause it
 
03:36:56.429 --> 03:36:56.439 align:start position:0%
do you feel that this subject matter I
 
03:36:59.269 --> 03:36:59.279 align:start position:0%
mean the the Supreme Court could
 
03:37:02.389 --> 03:37:02.399 align:start position:0%
theoretically take it and also very
 
03:37:05.030 --> 03:37:05.040 align:start position:0%
narrowly decid it just on the Firearms
 
03:37:06.429 --> 03:37:06.439 align:start position:0%
aspect do you think this is Broad enough
 
03:37:08.590 --> 03:37:08.600 align:start position:0%
to trigger the whole Commerce Clause um
 
03:37:10.670 --> 03:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
decision that's a very good question I I
 
03:37:12.750 --> 03:37:12.760 align:start position:0%
can't speculate as to what the ultimate
 
03:37:15.790 --> 03:37:15.800 align:start position:0%
outcome would be I would be happy to see
 
03:37:18.790 --> 03:37:18.800 align:start position:0%
a large change I would also be happy to
 
03:37:20.950 --> 03:37:20.960 align:start position:0%
see a small change that could represent
 
03:37:23.510 --> 03:37:23.520 align:start position:0%
an opening to Future further changes
 
03:37:23.520 --> 03:37:24.309 align:start position:0%
an opening to Future further changes
thank

03:37:24.309 --> 03:37:24.319 align:start position:0%
thank
 
03:37:28.590 --> 03:37:28.600 align:start position:0%
you yes uh representative lell thank you
 
03:37:33.870 --> 03:37:33.880 align:start position:0%
for taking my question um so if if I get
 
03:37:37.070 --> 03:37:37.080 align:start position:0%
the gist of the bill correctly this
 
03:37:37.080 --> 03:37:38.550 align:start position:0%
the gist of the bill correctly this
would

03:37:38.550 --> 03:37:38.560 align:start position:0%
would
 
03:37:42.550 --> 03:37:42.560 align:start position:0%
exempt firearms made within the state of
 
03:37:45.229 --> 03:37:45.239 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire from the National Firearms
 
03:37:46.790 --> 03:37:46.800 align:start position:0%
Act is that
 
03:37:49.429 --> 03:37:49.439 align:start position:0%
correct uh kind of yes it's a little
 
03:37:51.510 --> 03:37:51.520 align:start position:0%
more expansive than that so it actually
 
03:37:52.910 --> 03:37:52.920 align:start position:0%
it doesn't speak strictly to the
 
03:37:55.389 --> 03:37:55.399 align:start position:0%
National Firearms Act it speaks to all
 
03:37:57.469 --> 03:37:57.479 align:start position:0%
authority that the federal government
 
03:38:00.750 --> 03:38:00.760 align:start position:0%
claims to regulate um Firearms
 
03:38:03.229 --> 03:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
manufacturing under the Commerce Clause
 
03:38:05.750 --> 03:38:05.760 align:start position:0%
which would effectively be all federal
 
03:38:08.429 --> 03:38:08.439 align:start position:0%
firearms regulations follow up Mr
 
03:38:11.910 --> 03:38:11.920 align:start position:0%
chairman MH the National Firearms Act
 
03:38:16.269 --> 03:38:16.279 align:start position:0%
was put in place during the Depression
 
03:38:19.349 --> 03:38:19.359 align:start position:0%
to prohibit gangsters from having
 
03:38:19.359 --> 03:38:20.790 align:start position:0%
to prohibit gangsters from having
machine

03:38:20.790 --> 03:38:20.800 align:start position:0%
machine
 
03:38:24.309 --> 03:38:24.319 align:start position:0%
guns um that was the original impetus
 
03:38:27.630 --> 03:38:27.640 align:start position:0%
for the National Firearms Act if this
 
03:38:32.550 --> 03:38:32.560 align:start position:0%
bill were to pass and become law would
 
03:38:35.070 --> 03:38:35.080 align:start position:0%
machine guns be legal in the state of
 
03:38:35.080 --> 03:38:36.389 align:start position:0%
machine guns be legal in the state of
New

03:38:36.389 --> 03:38:36.399 align:start position:0%
New
 
03:38:38.429 --> 03:38:38.439 align:start position:0%
Hampshire well that that would be the
 
03:38:40.269 --> 03:38:40.279 align:start position:0%
question for the courts to establish
 
03:38:42.870 --> 03:38:42.880 align:start position:0%
once the um actual lawsuit occurred and
 
03:38:45.110 --> 03:38:45.120 align:start position:0%
the arguments were to happen uh but I
 
03:38:46.750 --> 03:38:46.760 align:start position:0%
would I would actually note that though
 
03:38:49.110 --> 03:38:49.120 align:start position:0%
it's not currently legal gangsters all
 
03:38:50.590 --> 03:38:50.600 align:start position:0%
over this country already have machine
 
03:38:52.389 --> 03:38:52.399 align:start position:0%
guns they put switches on their Glocks
 
03:38:54.349 --> 03:38:54.359 align:start position:0%
and they they shoot up cities all over
 
03:38:54.359 --> 03:38:55.349 align:start position:0%
and they they shoot up cities all over
the

03:38:55.349 --> 03:38:55.359 align:start position:0%
the
 
03:38:59.469 --> 03:38:59.479 align:start position:0%
place thank you and is it not true that
 
03:39:01.790 --> 03:39:01.800 align:start position:0%
if you happen to be a very rich citizen
 
03:39:04.110 --> 03:39:04.120 align:start position:0%
you can buy a machine gun now you indeed
 
03:39:06.830 --> 03:39:06.840 align:start position:0%
can it's uh it's very costly and it
 
03:39:08.349 --> 03:39:08.359 align:start position:0%
requires a bit of a weight and
 
03:39:09.630 --> 03:39:09.640 align:start position:0%
fingerprinting and all kinds of other
 
03:39:11.349 --> 03:39:11.359 align:start position:0%
stuff but yes you can in fact purchase a
 
03:39:13.110 --> 03:39:13.120 align:start position:0%
machine gun or a suppressor or a short
 
03:39:15.910 --> 03:39:15.920 align:start position:0%
barrel rifle or any of the above thank
 
03:39:18.429 --> 03:39:18.439 align:start position:0%

I'm testifying in support of HB 381 as
 
03:39:44.630 --> 03:39:44.640 align:start position:0%
the prime sponsor explained very
 
03:39:47.950 --> 03:39:47.960 align:start position:0%
eloquently uh we're in a great position
 
03:39:49.790 --> 03:39:49.800 align:start position:0%
to continue to challenge bad Supreme
 
03:39:51.790 --> 03:39:51.800 align:start position:0%
Court precedents we've overturned
 
03:39:54.550 --> 03:39:54.560 align:start position:0%
Chevron reigning in Bure bureaucratic
 
03:39:57.110 --> 03:39:57.120 align:start position:0%
overregulation we've overturned row
 
03:39:58.790 --> 03:39:58.800 align:start position:0%
returning one of the most cont uh
 
03:40:00.950 --> 03:40:00.960 align:start position:0%
contentious issues to States where
 
03:40:03.269 --> 03:40:03.279 align:start position:0%
people can move to and from states to
 
03:40:05.710 --> 03:40:05.720 align:start position:0%
live according to their beliefs now is
 
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
the time to challenge the bad president
 
03:40:10.870 --> 03:40:10.880 align:start position:0%
of wicker V filburn that is directly
 
03:40:12.630 --> 03:40:12.640 align:start position:0%
responsible for the erosion of the 10th
 
03:40:14.630 --> 03:40:14.640 align:start position:0%
Amendment and the consolidation of power
 
03:40:15.910 --> 03:40:15.920 align:start position:0%
in DC
 
03:40:17.670 --> 03:40:17.680 align:start position:0%
at face value the bill continues
 
03:40:19.389 --> 03:40:19.399 align:start position:0%
promoting New Hampshire as the
 
03:40:21.510 --> 03:40:21.520 align:start position:0%
friendliest for gun ownership and
 
03:40:23.910 --> 03:40:23.920 align:start position:0%
entices new manufacturing job creators
 
03:40:26.309 --> 03:40:26.319 align:start position:0%
to move here but it also serves as a
 
03:40:27.790 --> 03:40:27.800 align:start position:0%
vehicle for the inevitable Court
 
03:40:29.670 --> 03:40:29.680 align:start position:0%
challenge that will both question bad
 
03:40:31.670 --> 03:40:31.680 align:start position:0%
provisions of the National Firearms Act
 
03:40:33.990 --> 03:40:34.000 align:start position:0%
and the precedent of wicker I ask the
 
03:40:38.750 --> 03:40:38.760 align:start position:0%

the committee my name is MIL myit I'm
 
03:41:07.870 --> 03:41:07.880 align:start position:0%
from Pittsfield New Hampshire I
 
03:41:09.990 --> 03:41:10.000 align:start position:0%
represent myself here's testify in favor
 
03:41:12.510 --> 03:41:12.520 align:start position:0%
of this bill specifically as it regards
 
03:41:15.469 --> 03:41:15.479 align:start position:0%
sound suppressors you can um there's all
 
03:41:17.349 --> 03:41:17.359 align:start position:0%
sorts of you can say what you will about
 
03:41:19.870 --> 03:41:19.880 align:start position:0%
machine guns short bar barreled
 
03:41:22.630 --> 03:41:22.640 align:start position:0%
rifles sound suppressors on the other
 
03:41:22.640 --> 03:41:24.429 align:start position:0%
rifles sound suppressors on the other
hand

03:41:24.429 --> 03:41:24.439 align:start position:0%
hand
 
03:41:27.469 --> 03:41:27.479 align:start position:0%
are the
 
03:41:30.349 --> 03:41:30.359 align:start position:0%
um sound suppressors are presently very
 
03:41:32.550 --> 03:41:32.560 align:start position:0%
rare in throughout the United States
 
03:41:34.110 --> 03:41:34.120 align:start position:0%
including New Hampshire because of the
 
03:41:36.269 --> 03:41:36.279 align:start position:0%
amount of paperwork it
 
03:41:38.910 --> 03:41:38.920 align:start position:0%
takes I believe that almost every
 
03:41:41.110 --> 03:41:41.120 align:start position:0%
firearm ought to have have a sound
 
03:41:44.349 --> 03:41:44.359 align:start position:0%
suppressor this status quo in fact
 
03:41:46.590 --> 03:41:46.600 align:start position:0%
enables the prolifer ation of one of
 
03:41:49.590 --> 03:41:49.600 align:start position:0%
those evils that General Stark told us
 
03:41:51.630 --> 03:41:51.640 align:start position:0%
was greater than
 
03:41:54.950 --> 03:41:54.960 align:start position:0%
death how do I know about this well I
 
03:41:58.510 --> 03:41:58.520 align:start position:0%
wasn't into guns as a child at the age
 
03:42:01.590 --> 03:42:01.600 align:start position:0%
of five I took up the piano turns out
 
03:42:02.870 --> 03:42:02.880 align:start position:0%
when you do that your sense of hearing
 
03:42:04.670 --> 03:42:04.680 align:start position:0%
develops a little bit better I have
 
03:42:04.680 --> 03:42:05.950 align:start position:0%
develops a little bit better I have
perfect

03:42:05.950 --> 03:42:05.960 align:start position:0%
perfect
 
03:42:10.269 --> 03:42:10.279 align:start position:0%
pitch wasn't until 2019 though that I
 
03:42:12.389 --> 03:42:12.399 align:start position:0%
started to uh want to put my Farm's
 
03:42:14.750 --> 03:42:14.760 align:start position:0%
enthusiasm into practice with local
 
03:42:16.550 --> 03:42:16.560 align:start position:0%
Friendly neighborhood indoor gun range
 
03:42:19.389 --> 03:42:19.399 align:start position:0%
took an NRA basic pistol class went back
 
03:42:22.269 --> 03:42:22.279 align:start position:0%
 
03:42:24.870 --> 03:42:24.880 align:start position:0%
weekends then in the summer of 2020 I
 
03:42:27.510 --> 03:42:27.520 align:start position:0%
started to realize that this this right
 
03:42:29.750 --> 03:42:29.760 align:start position:0%
to keep and bear arms carries with it a
 
03:42:32.670 --> 03:42:32.680 align:start position:0%
responsibility to do so went back to
 
03:42:34.710 --> 03:42:34.720 align:start position:0%
that same facility one more
 
03:42:38.189 --> 03:42:38.199 align:start position:0%
time in that moment after I cut the
 
03:42:40.630 --> 03:42:40.640 align:start position:0%
ignition but before I pulled the door
 
03:42:43.149 --> 03:42:43.159 align:start position:0%
handle I heard peace and
 
03:42:47.269 --> 03:42:47.279 align:start position:0%
quiet that was the last time I ever did
 
03:42:50.550 --> 03:42:50.560 align:start position:0%
so that's where my story
 
03:42:52.670 --> 03:42:52.680 align:start position:0%
ends the one thing you still have
 
03:42:56.070 --> 03:42:56.080 align:start position:0%

damaged due to being exposed to a
 
03:43:14.229 --> 03:43:14.239 align:start position:0%
discharging of a firearm precisely okay
 
03:43:16.910 --> 03:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
and that had suppressors been used they
 
03:43:18.670 --> 03:43:18.680 align:start position:0%
would not have been were you were you

not wearing hearing protection at the
 
03:43:21.870 --> 03:43:21.880 align:start position:0%
time I was wearing hearing protection
 
03:43:24.429 --> 03:43:24.439 align:start position:0%
and it's still yes because your hearing

506 invite the prime sponsor to or a
 
04:00:23.710 --> 04:00:23.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:00:25.630 --> 04:00:25.640 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair members of Criminal
 
04:00:28.429 --> 04:00:28.439 align:start position:0%
Justice it's nice to be
 
04:00:32.189 --> 04:00:32.199 align:start position:0%
back um I was asked to file this bill by
 
04:00:34.030 --> 04:00:34.040 align:start position:0%
a constituent this is a bill from last
 
04:00:35.750 --> 04:00:35.760 align:start position:0%
year if you remember most of you
 
04:00:39.269 --> 04:00:39.279 align:start position:0%
remember House Bill
 
04:00:39.279 --> 04:00:40.790 align:start position:0%
remember House Bill
1339

04:00:40.790 --> 04:00:40.800 align:start position:0%
1339
 
04:00:44.670 --> 04:00:44.680 align:start position:0%
um that bill passed through this
 
04:00:46.830 --> 04:00:46.840 align:start position:0%
committee uh I think it was
 
04:00:49.790 --> 04:00:49.800 align:start position:0%
19-0 uh went out of Finance 25 to0 and
 
04:00:52.429 --> 04:00:52.439 align:start position:0%
it passed the house it got hung up in
 
04:00:54.790 --> 04:00:54.800 align:start position:0%
the Senate they laid it on the table and
 
04:00:57.229 --> 04:00:57.239 align:start position:0%
ended up killing it in October of last
 
04:00:59.910 --> 04:00:59.920 align:start position:0%
year um the version of the bill you see
 
04:01:02.349 --> 04:01:02.359 align:start position:0%
now was the latest version of it there
 
04:01:04.189 --> 04:01:04.199 align:start position:0%
was some issues with a shell in a May
 
04:01:05.309 --> 04:01:05.319 align:start position:0%
and some of the language that was
 
04:01:07.389 --> 04:01:07.399 align:start position:0%
changed to May so this bill is
 
04:01:09.870 --> 04:01:09.880 align:start position:0%
essentially the same bill that we had
 
04:01:12.990 --> 04:01:13.000 align:start position:0%
here last year what this bill does is it
 
04:01:15.710 --> 04:01:15.720 align:start position:0%
allows the return of property taken by
 
04:01:18.110 --> 04:01:18.120 align:start position:0%
um court order for either bail
 
04:01:20.510 --> 04:01:20.520 align:start position:0%
conditions or restraining order or any
 
04:01:23.189 --> 04:01:23.199 align:start position:0%
other court order that um requires the
 
04:01:24.790 --> 04:01:24.800 align:start position:0%
police to take your
 
04:01:27.030 --> 04:01:27.040 align:start position:0%
Firearms the issue with this is once
 
04:01:29.910 --> 04:01:29.920 align:start position:0%
that order has been vacated people have
 
04:01:32.189 --> 04:01:32.199 align:start position:0%
find themselves waiting you know weeks
 
04:01:35.349 --> 04:01:35.359 align:start position:0%
months maybe several months to get their
 
04:01:37.550 --> 04:01:37.560 align:start position:0%
property back so that person once that
 
04:01:39.309 --> 04:01:39.319 align:start position:0%
order is vacated they can go buy a
 
04:01:41.550 --> 04:01:41.560 align:start position:0%
firearm but they can't get their
 
04:01:44.710 --> 04:01:44.720 align:start position:0%
property back so this puts limits on it
 
04:01:47.070 --> 04:01:47.080 align:start position:0%
for the court to act on it um so that
 
04:01:49.189 --> 04:01:49.199 align:start position:0%
this property can be returned
 
04:01:53.429 --> 04:01:53.439 align:start position:0%
um expeditiously so um that's basically
 
04:01:54.510 --> 04:01:54.520 align:start position:0%
what the bill
 
04:01:56.590 --> 04:01:56.600 align:start position:0%
does uh if you have any questions I'll
 
04:01:57.670 --> 04:01:57.680 align:start position:0%
try to answer them however there are
 
04:01:58.750 --> 04:01:58.760 align:start position:0%
people that going to speak behind me
 
04:02:00.710 --> 04:02:00.720 align:start position:0%
that might be better served at answering
 
04:02:00.720 --> 04:02:01.550 align:start position:0%
that might be better served at answering
those

04:02:01.550 --> 04:02:01.560 align:start position:0%
those
 
04:02:04.429 --> 04:02:04.439 align:start position:0%
questions thank you if I
 
04:02:06.950 --> 04:02:06.960 align:start position:0%
recall there was also an
 
04:02:09.149 --> 04:02:09.159 align:start position:0%
issue where people had to actually bring
 
04:02:11.550 --> 04:02:11.560 align:start position:0%
a court case a separate court case to
 
04:02:13.429 --> 04:02:13.439 align:start position:0%
get their property back it wasn't being
 
04:02:15.389 --> 04:02:15.399 align:start position:0%
handled within the is that is that the
 
04:02:16.910 --> 04:02:16.920 align:start position:0%
case yeah I believe they had to request
 
04:02:18.630 --> 04:02:18.640 align:start position:0%
a hearing and then the court would set
 
04:02:20.309 --> 04:02:20.319 align:start position:0%
up a hearing date that could be a month
 
04:02:22.149 --> 04:02:22.159 align:start position:0%
two months three months out and they
 
04:02:24.950 --> 04:02:24.960 align:start position:0%
have to go in and and have a a court
 
04:02:27.269 --> 04:02:27.279 align:start position:0%
hearing in order to get their property
 
04:02:29.229 --> 04:02:29.239 align:start position:0%
returned that should essentially be
 
04:02:31.670 --> 04:02:31.680 align:start position:0%
returned once the order the first order
 
04:02:33.910 --> 04:02:33.920 align:start position:0%
was vacated and if they had been
 
04:02:37.269 --> 04:02:37.279 align:start position:0%
assigned councel in their case let's say
 
04:02:38.950 --> 04:02:38.960 align:start position:0%
a defense Council because it was an
 
04:02:41.790 --> 04:02:41.800 align:start position:0%
assault case and they won the assault
 
04:02:44.550 --> 04:02:44.560 align:start position:0%
case that Council wouldn't represent
 
04:02:45.910 --> 04:02:45.920 align:start position:0%
them to get their property back they had
 
04:02:47.189 --> 04:02:47.199 align:start position:0%
to go out and get another attorney is
 
04:02:49.349 --> 04:02:49.359 align:start position:0%
that correct that's how I believe it yes
 
04:02:52.630 --> 04:02:52.640 align:start position:0%
okay thank you representative
 
04:02:55.870 --> 04:02:55.880 align:start position:0%
share what were the problems in the
 
04:02:58.389 --> 04:02:58.399 align:start position:0%
Senate it was laid on the table and I
 
04:03:00.429 --> 04:03:00.439 align:start position:0%
don't know what the actual problem was I
 
04:03:02.469 --> 04:03:02.479 align:start position:0%
think they were hanging on to it and uh
 
04:03:04.950 --> 04:03:04.960 align:start position:0%
to kind of hold it during Committee of
 
04:03:06.830 --> 04:03:06.840 align:start position:0%
conference time and nothing it wasn't
 
04:03:10.870 --> 04:03:10.880 align:start position:0%
acted on so come October they it it got
 
04:03:15.349 --> 04:03:15.359 align:start position:0%
it thank you representative lell
 
04:03:18.469 --> 04:03:18.479 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
04:03:23.110 --> 04:03:23.120 align:start position:0%
um if this bill was enacted into law how
 
04:03:28.349 --> 04:03:28.359 align:start position:0%
would it work you say now it's it's drug
 
04:03:32.510 --> 04:03:32.520 align:start position:0%
out there's a lot of uh judicial uh
 
04:03:35.469 --> 04:03:35.479 align:start position:0%
regar rooll and so forth so how would
 
04:03:35.479 --> 04:03:36.750 align:start position:0%
regar rooll and so forth so how would
this

04:03:36.750 --> 04:03:36.760 align:start position:0%
this
 
04:03:39.149 --> 04:03:39.159 align:start position:0%
work so this is a question probably
 
04:03:40.510 --> 04:03:40.520 align:start position:0%
better suited for someone who's going to
 
04:03:43.469 --> 04:03:43.479 align:start position:0%
speak after me but this gives specific
 
04:03:46.149 --> 04:03:46.159 align:start position:0%
time time frames that that the process
 
04:03:48.870 --> 04:03:48.880 align:start position:0%
has to be completed by um it's not just
 
04:03:50.670 --> 04:03:50.680 align:start position:0%
you request a hearing and the court will
 
04:03:52.830 --> 04:03:52.840 align:start position:0%
schedule the hearing when they have time
 
04:03:54.349 --> 04:03:54.359 align:start position:0%
and we've had people testify that it
 
04:03:56.590 --> 04:03:56.600 align:start position:0%
could take upwards of three months this
 
04:04:00.389 --> 04:04:00.399 align:start position:0%
here has specific time frames uh that
 
04:04:03.870 --> 04:04:03.880 align:start position:0%
the court has to schedule and have this
 
04:04:05.870 --> 04:04:05.880 align:start position:0%
property returned by so it gives
 
04:04:09.389 --> 04:04:09.399 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:11.710 --> 04:04:11.720 align:start position:0%

representative Manion for filing the
 
04:05:18.910 --> 04:05:18.920 align:start position:0%
bill I believe I am the constituent who
 
04:05:22.910 --> 04:05:22.920 align:start position:0%
asked for this to be filed so I am um
 
04:05:25.229 --> 04:05:25.239 align:start position:0%
here to speak on support of House Bill
 
04:05:28.189 --> 04:05:28.199 align:start position:0%
506 I'm not here as a lobbyist I'm here
 
04:05:31.110 --> 04:05:31.120 align:start position:0%
as a concerned citizen who saw firsthand
 
04:05:31.120 --> 04:05:32.429 align:start position:0%
as a concerned citizen who saw firsthand
how

04:05:32.429 --> 04:05:32.439 align:start position:0%
how
 
04:05:36.110 --> 04:05:36.120 align:start position:0%
um violation of due process and an
 
04:05:38.830 --> 04:05:38.840 align:start position:0%
individual's rights with the return due
 
04:05:41.429 --> 04:05:41.439 align:start position:0%
to the return of firearms and ammunition
 
04:05:44.229 --> 04:05:44.239 align:start position:0%
related to an order of protection
 
04:05:46.510 --> 04:05:46.520 align:start position:0%
a close uh personal associate of mine
 
04:05:48.910 --> 04:05:48.920 align:start position:0%
had their firearms and ammunition uh
 
04:05:51.790 --> 04:05:51.800 align:start position:0%
confiscated related to a false claim of
 
04:05:54.030 --> 04:05:54.040 align:start position:0%
abuse the claim was a blatant abuse of
 
04:05:56.349 --> 04:05:56.359 align:start position:0%
our domestic violent laws which are
 
04:05:59.229 --> 04:05:59.239 align:start position:0%
meant to protect our most vulnerable
 
04:06:01.309 --> 04:06:01.319 align:start position:0%
citizens but instead it was used to
 
04:06:03.149 --> 04:06:03.159 align:start position:0%
retaliate against an individual who
 
04:06:05.750 --> 04:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
refused to give money to a family member
 
04:06:07.590 --> 04:06:07.600 align:start position:0%
and I'm going to clearly outline what
 
04:06:11.189 --> 04:06:11.199 align:start position:0%
happened day one was the argument and
 
04:06:13.910 --> 04:06:13.920 align:start position:0%
money wasn't given
 
04:06:16.229 --> 04:06:16.239 align:start position:0%
no further conversation it was over the
 
04:06:19.469 --> 04:06:19.479 align:start position:0%
phone day four a complaint was filed
 
04:06:22.670 --> 04:06:22.680 align:start position:0%
with the local police um that they were
 
04:06:25.990 --> 04:06:26.000 align:start position:0%
felt threatened the police investigated
 
04:06:29.269 --> 04:06:29.279 align:start position:0%
and found there was no um it was not to
 
04:06:31.990 --> 04:06:32.000 align:start position:0%
be uh
 
04:06:34.910 --> 04:06:34.920 align:start position:0%
credible day 10 another complaint was
 
04:06:38.349 --> 04:06:38.359 align:start position:0%
filed with the with the um the
 
04:06:40.790 --> 04:06:40.800 align:start position:0%
courts so then the firearms and
 
04:06:42.269 --> 04:06:42.279 align:start position:0%
ammunition were
 
04:06:45.990 --> 04:06:46.000 align:start position:0%
confiscated d 31 is the court hearing
 
04:06:48.870 --> 04:06:48.880 align:start position:0%
the courts now dismissed the case
 
04:06:50.870 --> 04:06:50.880 align:start position:0%
because it's not
 
04:06:53.790 --> 04:06:53.800 align:start position:0%
credible the police notified the person
 
04:06:56.269 --> 04:06:56.279 align:start position:0%
that they had found that the court was
 
04:06:57.870 --> 04:06:57.880 align:start position:0%
the case was dismissed and they were
 
04:07:00.469 --> 04:07:00.479 align:start position:0%
waiting for notification from the courts
 
04:07:01.870 --> 04:07:01.880 align:start position:0%
for the return of firearms and
 
04:07:05.670 --> 04:07:05.680 align:start position:0%
ammunition it never came 2 weeks later
 
04:07:07.910 --> 04:07:07.920 align:start position:0%
the individual went to the court and was
 
04:07:10.990 --> 04:07:11.000 align:start position:0%
told they had to have another
 
04:07:14.950 --> 04:07:14.960 align:start position:0%
hearing day 78 is a second
 
04:07:18.389 --> 04:07:18.399 align:start position:0%
hearing again no notification was given
 
04:07:21.070 --> 04:07:21.080 align:start position:0%
to the courts um to the police that the
 
04:07:23.349 --> 04:07:23.359 align:start position:0%
com that the uh Firearms were to be
 
04:07:26.750 --> 04:07:26.760 align:start position:0%
returned it took day 100 before the
 
04:07:29.149 --> 04:07:29.159 align:start position:0%
firearms and ammunition were
 
04:07:32.510 --> 04:07:32.520 align:start position:0%
returned over two months after the court
 
04:07:35.349 --> 04:07:35.359 align:start position:0%
case was dismissed 69 days to be exact
 
04:07:37.830 --> 04:07:37.840 align:start position:0%
before property was returned in a case
 
04:07:40.149 --> 04:07:40.159 align:start position:0%
that was investigated by the police and
 
04:07:42.309 --> 04:07:42.319 align:start position:0%
the courts and both found not to be
 
04:07:45.870 --> 04:07:45.880 align:start position:0%
credible a clear case of gross abuse of
 
04:07:48.149 --> 04:07:48.159 align:start position:0%
our domestic violence laws and yet it
 
04:07:50.349 --> 04:07:50.359 align:start position:0%
still took 69
 
04:07:53.670 --> 04:07:53.680 align:start position:0%
days House Bill 506 would ensure a
 
04:07:55.229 --> 04:07:55.239 align:start position:0%
timely return of firearms and
 
04:07:57.590 --> 04:07:57.600 align:start position:0%
ammunitions it lays out a two-day time
 
04:08:00.269 --> 04:08:00.279 align:start position:0%
frame for a request of background check
 
04:08:02.189 --> 04:08:02.199 align:start position:0%
and a 10-day decision from the
 
04:08:05.109 --> 04:08:05.119 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety this is a 12-day
 
04:08:07.070 --> 04:08:07.080 align:start position:0%
time frame that would have expedited the
 
04:08:07.080 --> 04:08:08.950 align:start position:0%
time frame that would have expedited the
69

04:08:08.950 --> 04:08:08.960 align:start position:0%
69
 
04:08:11.229 --> 04:08:11.239 align:start position:0%
days the only thing missing from this
 
04:08:14.389 --> 04:08:14.399 align:start position:0%
bill and I would ask for an amendment
 
04:08:16.910 --> 04:08:16.920 align:start position:0%
um is a time frame that the courts must
 
04:08:20.349 --> 04:08:20.359 align:start position:0%
notify the police of a return of
 
04:08:23.189 --> 04:08:23.199 align:start position:0%
firearms or return of property I would
 
04:08:26.070 --> 04:08:26.080 align:start position:0%
request that you add another two days
 
04:08:28.910 --> 04:08:28.920 align:start position:0%
that once the uh Department of Safety
 
04:08:30.389 --> 04:08:30.399 align:start position:0%
has made their decision and told the
 
04:08:32.070 --> 04:08:32.080 align:start position:0%
courts the courts have two days to
 
04:08:33.710 --> 04:08:33.720 align:start position:0%
notify the police department that they
 
04:08:36.269 --> 04:08:36.279 align:start position:0%
have to return
 
04:08:38.510 --> 04:08:38.520 align:start position:0%
property that's my testimony and I'm
 
04:08:39.990 --> 04:08:40.000 align:start position:0%
open to
 
04:08:42.590 --> 04:08:42.600 align:start position:0%
questions thank you um when the person
 
04:08:45.109 --> 04:08:45.119 align:start position:0%
went to the court court hearing the
 
04:08:47.389 --> 04:08:47.399 align:start position:0%
second one the one they to get their
 
04:08:49.790 --> 04:08:49.800 align:start position:0%
property back at that time did the court
 
04:08:51.429 --> 04:08:51.439 align:start position:0%
issue an order in their
 
04:08:54.510 --> 04:08:54.520 align:start position:0%
favor yes well the court ordered um a
 
04:08:56.670 --> 04:08:56.680 align:start position:0%
dism the case was dismissed the first
 
04:08:59.670 --> 04:08:59.680 align:start position:0%
one yeah but we they had to go back and
 
04:09:03.109 --> 04:09:03.119 align:start position:0%
ask for uh their firearms yeah it took
 
04:09:05.750 --> 04:09:05.760 align:start position:0%
two seconds and they said yes go ahead
 
04:09:07.870 --> 04:09:07.880 align:start position:0%
you can have them back but we never
 
04:09:11.030 --> 04:09:11.040 align:start position:0%
never received the notice so what how
 
04:09:12.710 --> 04:09:12.720 align:start position:0%
did the notice finally end up getting
 
04:09:14.710 --> 04:09:14.720 align:start position:0%
there just to showed up or snail mail
 
04:09:15.630 --> 04:09:15.640 align:start position:0%
they said it would come through the
 
04:09:17.950 --> 04:09:17.960 align:start position:0%
snail mail so it took that long so from
 
04:09:20.030 --> 04:09:20.040 align:start position:0%
the time the judge during the two-minute
 
04:09:21.349 --> 04:09:21.359 align:start position:0%
hearing said yes you're correct you
 
04:09:23.070 --> 04:09:23.080 align:start position:0%
should have your property back it took
 
04:09:25.710 --> 04:09:25.720 align:start position:0%
an additional 22 days 22 days for that
 
04:09:28.030 --> 04:09:28.040 align:start position:0%
order to get there I see all right thank
 
04:09:29.870 --> 04:09:29.880 align:start position:0%
you and the other thing is ties up our
 
04:09:32.950 --> 04:09:32.960 align:start position:0%
court systems yeah that are grossly
 
04:09:35.950 --> 04:09:35.960 align:start position:0%
understaffed and it ties up uh police
 
04:09:39.229 --> 04:09:39.239 align:start position:0%
storage sure so did did the person get
 
04:09:40.710 --> 04:09:40.720 align:start position:0%
an order from the court that day in
 
04:09:43.790 --> 04:09:43.800 align:start position:0%
their hand no no so have they got an
 
04:09:44.910 --> 04:09:44.920 align:start position:0%
order they could have brought that order
 
04:09:46.750 --> 04:09:46.760 align:start position:0%
to the police department themselves if
 
04:09:48.309 --> 04:09:48.319 align:start position:0%
they could but the uh judge said it
 
04:09:49.670 --> 04:09:49.680 align:start position:0%
would come but through the snail mail
 
04:09:53.750 --> 04:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
sure okay representative share um just
 
04:09:55.990 --> 04:09:56.000 align:start position:0%
as a point of information for everybody
 
04:09:59.070 --> 04:09:59.080 align:start position:0%
the court there's no automatic procedure
 
04:10:01.109 --> 04:10:01.119 align:start position:0%
that's for executive session okay that
 
04:10:04.550 --> 04:10:04.560 align:start position:0%
you can edify us well I was hoping to
 
04:10:07.349 --> 04:10:07.359 align:start position:0%
everybody yeah go ahead go ahead uh
 
04:10:10.269 --> 04:10:10.279 align:start position:0%
there's no automatic procedure in for
 
04:10:13.030 --> 04:10:13.040 align:start position:0%
the once a case is dismissed a DB case
 
04:10:16.710 --> 04:10:16.720 align:start position:0%
was dismissed for the court to notify
 
04:10:18.550 --> 04:10:18.560 align:start position:0%
people that they can come pick up their
 
04:10:20.429 --> 04:10:20.439 align:start position:0%
property that's just not part of what
 
04:10:23.030 --> 04:10:23.040 align:start position:0%
the court does so you this legislation
 
04:10:25.910 --> 04:10:25.920 align:start position:0%
would help that yes yeah I think it
 
04:10:27.670 --> 04:10:27.680 align:start position:0%
would help and the the police department
 
04:10:29.950 --> 04:10:29.960 align:start position:0%
was notified that the case was dismissed
 
04:10:32.269 --> 04:10:32.279 align:start position:0%
but they couldn't release the firearms
 
04:10:34.389 --> 04:10:34.399 align:start position:0%
and the ammunition without the L without
 
04:10:36.309 --> 04:10:36.319 align:start position:0%
the letter
 
04:10:38.790 --> 04:10:38.800 align:start position:0%

04:10:41.269 --> 04:10:41.279 align:start position:0%

04:10:51.469 --> 04:10:51.479 align:start position:0%
 
04:10:55.070 --> 04:10:55.080 align:start position:0%
Stone good afternoon John Stone clamont
 
04:10:57.469 --> 04:10:57.479 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire I was the original Prime
 
04:11:00.590 --> 04:11:00.600 align:start position:0%
sponsor last year of uh this bill under
 
04:11:03.990 --> 04:11:04.000 align:start position:0%
the previous number which was 1339 and
 
04:11:06.550 --> 04:11:06.560 align:start position:0%
this bill is strictly about establishing
 
04:11:08.630 --> 04:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
time frames for a court proceeding to
 
04:11:10.630 --> 04:11:10.640 align:start position:0%
the do the return of firearms uh one of
 
04:11:12.510 --> 04:11:12.520 align:start position:0%
the issues that was brought up last year
 
04:11:14.429 --> 04:11:14.439 align:start position:0%
from some of the state holders that from
 
04:11:15.950 --> 04:11:15.960 align:start position:0%
a law enforcement aspect of it that
 
04:11:18.229 --> 04:11:18.239 align:start position:0%
contacted me the evidence room gets
 
04:11:19.990 --> 04:11:20.000 align:start position:0%
filled with a lot of people's Firearms
 
04:11:21.830 --> 04:11:21.840 align:start position:0%
they sit there the court case is either
 
04:11:23.590 --> 04:11:23.600 align:start position:0%
been null Prost it's not a domestic
 
04:11:26.070 --> 04:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
related case each agency decides whether
 
04:11:27.550 --> 04:11:27.560 align:start position:0%
they're going to give guns back and how
 
04:11:28.750 --> 04:11:28.760 align:start position:0%
they're going to facilitate that through
 
04:11:30.910 --> 04:11:30.920 align:start position:0%
their own local policy I believe it's
 
04:11:32.309 --> 04:11:32.319 align:start position:0%
the state police's intention that they
 
04:11:34.229 --> 04:11:34.239 align:start position:0%
would like to have a get out of jail
 
04:11:37.189 --> 04:11:37.199 align:start position:0%
free card that if it's given to them
 
04:11:39.389 --> 04:11:39.399 align:start position:0%
they will freely give the guns back but
 
04:11:41.189 --> 04:11:41.199 align:start position:0%
only at a court order regardless of the
 
04:11:42.550 --> 04:11:42.560 align:start position:0%
circumstances why the guns were taken
 
04:11:44.670 --> 04:11:44.680 align:start position:0%
and Captain muzy is sitting behind me he
 
04:11:45.870 --> 04:11:45.880 align:start position:0%
was involved in I believe the
 
04:11:47.550 --> 04:11:47.560 align:start position:0%
subcommittee we ran last year as well as
 
04:11:49.830 --> 04:11:49.840 align:start position:0%
the language of this bill uh along with
 
04:11:51.070 --> 04:11:51.080 align:start position:0%
some other stakeholders that are behind
 
04:11:53.550 --> 04:11:53.560 align:start position:0%
me there was a consensus among all of us
 
04:11:54.750 --> 04:11:54.760 align:start position:0%
this was a good bill when we brought it
 
04:11:56.550 --> 04:11:56.560 align:start position:0%
to the house it did pass the house it
 
04:11:58.630 --> 04:11:58.640 align:start position:0%
did die in the Senate uh something to
 
04:12:00.269 --> 04:12:00.279 align:start position:0%
remember is these Firearms are
 
04:12:02.149 --> 04:12:02.159 align:start position:0%
individual's property in some cases have
 
04:12:04.550 --> 04:12:04.560 align:start position:0%
either monetary value some significant
 
04:12:06.189 --> 04:12:06.199 align:start position:0%
monetary value depending on what the
 
04:12:09.269 --> 04:12:09.279 align:start position:0%
items are and evidence rooms are not
 
04:12:11.550 --> 04:12:11.560 align:start position:0%
really generally policed all that well
 
04:12:13.830 --> 04:12:13.840 align:start position:0%
they're kind of stored uh
 
04:12:15.309 --> 04:12:15.319 align:start position:0%
you know they could develop rust they
 
04:12:16.950 --> 04:12:16.960 align:start position:0%
could get banged around that could
 
04:12:19.309 --> 04:12:19.319 align:start position:0%
decrease the value of someone's property
 
04:12:21.510 --> 04:12:21.520 align:start position:0%
uh once a person is uh no longer
 
04:12:22.710 --> 04:12:22.720 align:start position:0%
prohibited there's no reason for the
 
04:12:24.630 --> 04:12:24.640 align:start position:0%
state to be exercising control over
 
04:12:27.309 --> 04:12:27.319 align:start position:0%
one's property and that was to rectify
 
04:12:29.229 --> 04:12:29.239 align:start position:0%
this is to make sure the courts have
 
04:12:30.870 --> 04:12:30.880 align:start position:0%
established time frames of which to
 
04:12:32.070 --> 04:12:32.080 align:start position:0%
return the firearm so that's it's not
 
04:12:35.070 --> 04:12:35.080 align:start position:0%
out there three four five months I'm
 
04:12:36.269 --> 04:12:36.279 align:start position:0%
willing to take any questions and I'd
 
04:12:38.469 --> 04:12:38.479 align:start position:0%
recommend that this uh bill is ought to
 
04:12:42.510 --> 04:12:42.520 align:start position:0%
pass um what is your position on the um
 
04:12:46.109 --> 04:12:46.119 align:start position:0%
the suggested amendment by the citizen
 
04:12:49.550 --> 04:12:49.560 align:start position:0%
regarding the two days I think the uh
 
04:12:51.550 --> 04:12:51.560 align:start position:0%
that would be excellent the other uh
 
04:12:54.590 --> 04:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
issue that was brought up by Captain
 
04:12:56.349 --> 04:12:56.359 align:start position:0%
excuse me deputy chief Allen of the CL
 
04:12:57.389 --> 04:12:57.399 align:start position:0%
Police Department who was yesterday is
 
04:12:59.269 --> 04:12:59.279 align:start position:0%
that they were just concerned that
 
04:13:01.790 --> 04:13:01.800 align:start position:0%
they'd be a party when this order would
 
04:13:03.189 --> 04:13:03.199 align:start position:0%
be filed so they would would know about
 
04:13:05.030 --> 04:13:05.040 align:start position:0%
it so it didn't slip through them
 
04:13:07.070 --> 04:13:07.080 align:start position:0%
because this bill specifically says the
 
04:13:08.870 --> 04:13:08.880 align:start position:0%
department of safety if issued by the
 
04:13:10.590 --> 04:13:10.600 align:start position:0%
court is to do the Nicks background
 
04:13:11.910 --> 04:13:11.920 align:start position:0%
check yeah they just don't want to feel
 
04:13:13.229 --> 04:13:13.239 align:start position:0%
like they were outside the loop so that
 
04:13:14.990 --> 04:13:15.000 align:start position:0%
they would be included as a party to
 
04:13:17.469 --> 04:13:17.479 align:start position:0%
safeguard any duplicate issues that may
 
04:13:20.189 --> 04:13:20.199 align:start position:0%
arise would there be an issue I if it
 
04:13:23.429 --> 04:13:23.439 align:start position:0%
allowed the court to hand a notice to
 
04:13:25.750 --> 04:13:25.760 align:start position:0%
the plaintiff that they could just take
 
04:13:28.030 --> 04:13:28.040 align:start position:0%
to the police and say Here's my order I
 
04:13:29.189 --> 04:13:29.199 align:start position:0%
wouldn't want to speak on their behalf
 
04:13:30.429 --> 04:13:30.439 align:start position:0%
that I would think that a court order
 
04:13:33.149 --> 04:13:33.159 align:start position:0%
issued in hand is has the same uh you
 
04:13:35.990 --> 04:13:36.000 align:start position:0%
know Authority as suspenders mail them
 
04:13:38.030 --> 04:13:38.040 align:start position:0%
one too correct yeah and I know the
 
04:13:40.189 --> 04:13:40.199 align:start position:0%
court system now uses the portal system
 
04:13:41.750 --> 04:13:41.760 align:start position:0%
you know some of those old folks
 
04:13:43.189 --> 04:13:43.199 align:start position:0%
remember when that used to be all
 
04:13:44.469 --> 04:13:44.479 align:start position:0%
written and now a lot of it's
 
04:13:47.269 --> 04:13:47.279 align:start position:0%
electronically uh produced submitted
 
04:13:49.070 --> 04:13:49.080 align:start position:0%
we'll ask the state police thank you any
 
04:13:51.389 --> 04:13:51.399 align:start position:0%
questions for anyone else see none thank
 
04:13:54.070 --> 04:13:54.080 align:start position:0%
 
04:13:58.590 --> 04:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:01.750 --> 04:14:01.760 align:start position:0%
Banger Ray Banger anyone sounding like
 
04:14:01.760 --> 04:14:04.109 align:start position:0%
Banger Ray Banger anyone sounding like
Ray

04:14:04.109 --> 04:14:04.119 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:07.750 --> 04:14:07.760 align:start position:0%
Banger okay next U Captain M did you
 
04:14:15.670 --> 04:14:15.680 align:start position:0%
 
04:14:19.070 --> 04:14:19.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have to I just no just uh good
 
04:14:20.750 --> 04:14:20.760 align:start position:0%
afternoon chairman and members honorable
 
04:14:22.070 --> 04:14:22.080 align:start position:0%
members of the committee I'm captain
 
04:14:23.510 --> 04:14:23.520 align:start position:0%
muzy from the state police I'm in charge
 
04:14:25.950 --> 04:14:25.960 align:start position:0%
of the Justice information Bureau which
 
04:14:27.070 --> 04:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
includes the uh the permits and
 
04:14:28.670 --> 04:14:28.680 align:start position:0%
Licensing unit for those that I I don't
 
04:14:31.590 --> 04:14:31.600 align:start position:0%
know so I did uh testify on this last
 
04:14:33.590 --> 04:14:33.600 align:start position:0%
year we did work on um some some
 
04:14:36.109 --> 04:14:36.119 align:start position:0%
language changes and things and I think
 
04:14:38.349 --> 04:14:38.359 align:start position:0%
just to answer your question about um
 
04:14:41.750 --> 04:14:41.760 align:start position:0%
the potential amendment of um a an order
 
04:14:43.429 --> 04:14:43.439 align:start position:0%
in hand or something like that I from my
 
04:14:44.429 --> 04:14:44.439 align:start position:0%
perspective and I don't want to speak
 
04:14:46.109 --> 04:14:46.119 align:start position:0%
for every department but personally as
 
04:14:47.070 --> 04:14:47.080 align:start position:0%
as an officer and what I would be
 
04:14:49.510 --> 04:14:49.520 align:start position:0%
looking for that would be great um as
 
04:14:51.429 --> 04:14:51.439 align:start position:0%
long as we have an order signed by a
 
04:14:53.429 --> 04:14:53.439 align:start position:0%
judge that we can rely on to say we have
 
04:14:55.750 --> 04:14:55.760 align:start position:0%
a signed order here to release these um
 
04:14:57.469 --> 04:14:57.479 align:start position:0%
it would certainly be more expedient if
 
04:15:00.750 --> 04:15:00.760 align:start position:0%
it were in hand um so I I I don't think
 
04:15:03.630 --> 04:15:03.640 align:start position:0%
the police would be opposed to that
 
04:15:06.109 --> 04:15:06.119 align:start position:0%
theory and I think I understand that and
 
04:15:07.269 --> 04:15:07.279 align:start position:0%
I don't want to speak for the court the
 
04:15:08.750 --> 04:15:08.760 align:start position:0%
two-day window by which the court would
 
04:15:11.429 --> 04:15:11.439 align:start position:0%
have to notify the department that seems
 
04:15:14.389 --> 04:15:14.399 align:start position:0%
somewhat reasonable to me um um I assume
 
04:15:15.790 --> 04:15:15.800 align:start position:0%
an email or something would suffice I
 
04:15:17.349 --> 04:15:17.359 align:start position:0%
don't know how rigorous the process
 
04:15:19.309 --> 04:15:19.319 align:start position:0%
would need to be to uh to make that
 
04:15:21.070 --> 04:15:21.080 align:start position:0%
notification and I can tell you that
 
04:15:22.590 --> 04:15:22.600 align:start position:0%
from the police's perspective yes we
 
04:15:25.109 --> 04:15:25.119 align:start position:0%
would be looking to empty evidence rooms
 
04:15:26.870 --> 04:15:26.880 align:start position:0%
um more quickly so that that goes to
 
04:15:29.550 --> 04:15:29.560 align:start position:0%
that effort as well thank you uh I feel
 
04:15:31.149 --> 04:15:31.159 align:start position:0%
like if we do the inhand order the
 
04:15:33.070 --> 04:15:33.080 align:start position:0%
two-day thing is really doesn't matter
 
04:15:34.189 --> 04:15:34.199 align:start position:0%
then at that point they can just
 
04:15:36.670 --> 04:15:36.680 align:start position:0%
literally mail the other one but if they
 
04:15:38.590 --> 04:15:38.600 align:start position:0%
have it in hand they have it in hand
 
04:15:40.469 --> 04:15:40.479 align:start position:0%
certainly thank you further questions
 
04:15:41.910 --> 04:15:41.920 align:start position:0%
for the
 
04:15:44.990 --> 04:15:45.000 align:start position:0%
captain seeing none thank you anyone
 
04:15:46.469 --> 04:15:46.479 align:start position:0%
else wish to testify on this bill who
 
04:15:48.670 --> 04:15:48.680 align:start position:0%
has not done so seeing none I here by

04:59:58.868 --> 04:59:58.878 align:start position:0%
I'm open in public hearing on House Bill
 
05:00:00.868 --> 05:00:00.878 align:start position:0%
551 I invite the prime sponsor to
 
05:00:21.670 --> 05:00:21.680 align:start position:0%
 
05:00:22.990 --> 05:00:23.000 align:start position:0%
uh good afternoon committee good
 
05:00:26.270 --> 05:00:26.280 align:start position:0%
afternoon uh chairman Roy uh I'm rep
 
05:00:28.548 --> 05:00:28.558 align:start position:0%
John SS I am not the prime sponsor I am
 
05:00:30.788 --> 05:00:30.798 align:start position:0%
the co-sponsor the prime sponsor is out
 
05:00:33.548 --> 05:00:33.558 align:start position:0%
sick today okay I'm just going to
 
05:00:35.708 --> 05:00:35.718 align:start position:0%
introduce the bill I'm hoping there you
 
05:00:37.070 --> 05:00:37.080 align:start position:0%
have a few more people that want to talk
 
05:00:40.150 --> 05:00:40.160 align:start position:0%
to it my my under my understanding of
 
05:00:42.430 --> 05:00:42.440 align:start position:0%
bill of course I signed on to it is that
 
05:00:45.868 --> 05:00:45.878 align:start position:0%
to stop and get rid of some duplication
 
05:00:46.990 --> 05:00:47.000 align:start position:0%
if they're already doing it at the
 
05:00:49.350 --> 05:00:49.360 align:start position:0%
federal level there's no reason why we
 
05:00:52.390 --> 05:00:52.400 align:start position:0%
need to do it at the municipal level as
 
05:00:53.670 --> 05:00:53.680 align:start position:0%
far as getting
 
05:00:56.628 --> 05:00:56.638 align:start position:0%
approval selling firealarm so well I'm
 
05:00:58.270 --> 05:00:58.280 align:start position:0%
not going to go into too much more but
 
05:01:00.708 --> 05:01:00.718 align:start position:0%
that's my gist of understanding of this
 
05:01:03.350 --> 05:01:03.360 align:start position:0%
bill and I'll take a question or two if
 
05:01:04.670 --> 05:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
you want but I'm not sure if I can help
 
05:01:05.788 --> 05:01:05.798 align:start position:0%
you out too
 
05:01:08.390 --> 05:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
much uh that's I don't believe necessary
 
05:01:09.990 --> 05:01:10.000 align:start position:0%
I think we understand the gist of it is
 
05:01:11.030 --> 05:01:11.040 align:start position:0%
there anyone else here is going to
 
05:01:13.430 --> 05:01:13.440 align:start position:0%
testify on yeah there's a few people so
 
05:01:15.990 --> 05:01:16.000 align:start position:0%
thank you all right thank you committee
 
05:01:17.788 --> 05:01:17.798 align:start position:0%
the chair calls
 
05:01:29.350 --> 05:01:29.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:01:31.948 --> 05:01:31.958 align:start position:0%

05:01:34.080 --> 05:01:35.310 align:start position:0%
committee uh for record representative
Henry

05:01:35.310 --> 05:01:35.320 align:start position:0%
Henry
 
05:01:38.990 --> 05:01:39.000 align:start position:0%
gon T an District Hillsboro County so
 
05:01:40.670 --> 05:01:40.680 align:start position:0%
what this does it repeal the requirement
 
05:01:42.868 --> 05:01:42.878 align:start position:0%
for a second licensing or permitting
 
05:01:45.628 --> 05:01:45.638 align:start position:0%
that no other small business has when
 
05:01:47.990 --> 05:01:48.000 align:start position:0%
they have to found no other business has
 
05:01:50.750 --> 05:01:50.760 align:start position:0%
to apply for a second permit through
 
05:01:52.030 --> 05:01:52.040 align:start position:0%
their town or
 
05:01:54.030 --> 05:01:54.040 align:start position:0%
municipality uh it's a second layer of
 
05:01:55.590 --> 05:01:55.600 align:start position:0%
administration that does not increase
 
05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
safety and what it does do is it slows
 
05:01:59.708 --> 05:01:59.718 align:start position:0%
down the ability for the small business
 
05:02:02.948 --> 05:02:02.958 align:start position:0%
owner to be able to begin their business
 
05:02:05.430 --> 05:02:05.440 align:start position:0%
FFL compliance is already the first step
 
05:02:07.230 --> 05:02:07.240 align:start position:0%
and with FFL compliance the police chief
 
05:02:09.548 --> 05:02:09.558 align:start position:0%
or department has already been notified
 
05:02:11.430 --> 05:02:11.440 align:start position:0%
so this second layer does not increase
 
05:02:13.350 --> 05:02:13.360 align:start position:0%
safety by notifying anybody
 
05:02:15.750 --> 05:02:15.760 align:start position:0%
else uh it removes a requirement which
 
05:02:18.110 --> 05:02:18.120 align:start position:0%
can only lead to a delay in the business
 
05:02:20.350 --> 05:02:20.360 align:start position:0%
um and is pre uh and can be prejudiced
 
05:02:22.628 --> 05:02:22.638 align:start position:0%
in its execution there's no fiscal
 
05:02:25.070 --> 05:02:25.080 align:start position:0%
impact of passing this and there's no
 
05:02:27.548 --> 05:02:27.558 align:start position:0%
safety impact of passing this it simply
 
05:02:29.788 --> 05:02:29.798 align:start position:0%
streamlines a process that's already
 
05:02:31.750 --> 05:02:31.760 align:start position:0%
there by getting rid of a redundancy at
 
05:02:33.548 --> 05:02:33.558 align:start position:0%
the Town level that can be abused at the
 
05:02:36.948 --> 05:02:36.958 align:start position:0%
Town level thank
 
05:02:39.830 --> 05:02:39.840 align:start position:0%
you thank you for um testifying about
 
05:02:40.830 --> 05:02:40.840 align:start position:0%
about this
 
05:02:43.190 --> 05:02:43.200 align:start position:0%
bill are you able to take any questions
 
05:02:46.788 --> 05:02:46.798 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:49.590 --> 05:02:49.600 align:start position:0%
no so it's my
 
05:02:52.830 --> 05:02:52.840 align:start position:0%
understanding to run a Firearms business
 
05:02:54.670 --> 05:02:54.680 align:start position:0%
you have to obviously get your federal
 
05:02:59.708 --> 05:02:59.718 align:start position:0%
firearms license and um they check where
 
05:03:00.868 --> 05:03:00.878 align:start position:0%
you are to make sure you're in
 
05:03:02.990 --> 05:03:03.000 align:start position:0%
compliance with zoning and so
 
05:03:07.070 --> 05:03:07.080 align:start position:0%
forth what does the town license
 
05:03:09.310 --> 05:03:09.320 align:start position:0%
do my understanding is that the town
 
05:03:11.510 --> 05:03:11.520 align:start position:0%
license only gives the town an objection
 
05:03:14.190 --> 05:03:14.200 align:start position:0%
to or lengthens the process and may

which is a federally Firearms licensed

business in addition I serve as the uh
 
05:03:56.150 --> 05:03:56.160 align:start position:0%

bill uh as a sponsor it said this bill
 
05:04:04.430 --> 05:04:04.440 align:start position:0%
is going to be removing a kind of uh
 
05:04:07.110 --> 05:04:07.120 align:start position:0%
archaic requirement for municipality in
 
05:04:09.310 --> 05:04:09.320 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire to issue a license to sell
 
05:04:13.708 --> 05:04:13.718 align:start position:0%
pistol and revolvers uh it really serves
 
05:04:16.948 --> 05:04:16.958 align:start position:0%
no other purpose than to really put a
 
05:04:18.270 --> 05:04:18.280 align:start position:0%
double notice on the police department
 
05:04:19.310 --> 05:04:19.320 align:start position:0%
that already knows that you're in
 
05:04:21.310 --> 05:04:21.320 align:start position:0%
business selling Firearms it's part of
 
05:04:23.670 --> 05:04:23.680 align:start position:0%
the process of obtaining an FFL you have
 
05:04:25.070 --> 05:04:25.080 align:start position:0%
to have an inspection done before the
 
05:04:26.830 --> 05:04:26.840 align:start position:0%
license is issued and part of that is
 
05:04:28.590 --> 05:04:28.600 align:start position:0%
the uh the zoning requirements for your
 
05:04:31.070 --> 05:04:31.080 align:start position:0%
municipality have to be met with that
 
05:04:33.350 --> 05:04:33.360 align:start position:0%
being said if there's an issue there the
 
05:04:35.708 --> 05:04:35.718 align:start position:0%
uh process stops until that situation is
 
05:04:38.190 --> 05:04:38.200 align:start position:0%
rectified um I know we have some rural
 
05:04:39.708 --> 05:04:39.718 align:start position:0%
areas of New Hampshire and we also have
 
05:04:42.030 --> 05:04:42.040 align:start position:0%
some you know metropolitan areas that
 
05:04:43.910 --> 05:04:43.920 align:start position:0%
zoning is very clear there's nothing
 
05:04:45.670 --> 05:04:45.680 align:start position:0%
getting put up or put out that they
 
05:04:48.190 --> 05:04:48.200 align:start position:0%
don't know about uh I don't know if
 
05:04:49.830 --> 05:04:49.840 align:start position:0%
there's a fee for some municipalities
 
05:04:51.750 --> 05:04:51.760 align:start position:0%
for the license I know it's kind of a
 
05:04:52.948 --> 05:04:52.958 align:start position:0%
hassle sometimes to track down your
 
05:04:56.150 --> 05:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
local Chief to get him to uh issue you a
 
05:04:58.430 --> 05:04:58.440 align:start position:0%
license when yours is expiring and your
 
05:05:00.628 --> 05:05:00.638 align:start position:0%
continuing business uh currently there
 
05:05:02.708 --> 05:05:02.718 align:start position:0%
is no other State Licensing for firearms
 
05:05:03.910 --> 05:05:03.920 align:start position:0%
dealers in the state of New Hampshire is
 
05:05:06.230 --> 05:05:06.240 align:start position:0%
strictly a federal firearms license uh
 
05:05:08.270 --> 05:05:08.280 align:start position:0%
the feds do know where you are they know
 
05:05:09.390 --> 05:05:09.400 align:start position:0%
your premise because you can only be
 
05:05:12.548 --> 05:05:12.558 align:start position:0%
liced by an individual FFL for each
 
05:05:13.830 --> 05:05:13.840 align:start position:0%
business that you have if you have two
 
05:05:16.788 --> 05:05:16.798 align:start position:0%
businesses you need an additional FFL
 
05:05:18.270 --> 05:05:18.280 align:start position:0%
both of them need zoning done prior to
 
05:05:22.350 --> 05:05:22.360 align:start position:0%
them coming to see you U as regards to
 
05:05:24.350 --> 05:05:24.360 align:start position:0%
some of the other things the uh sponsor
 
05:05:26.390 --> 05:05:26.400 align:start position:0%
already hit on it that federal law
 
05:05:28.310 --> 05:05:28.320 align:start position:0%
already prohibits selling to out ofers
 
05:05:32.030 --> 05:05:32.040 align:start position:0%
even as an unlicensed individual uh I
 
05:05:33.910 --> 05:05:33.920 align:start position:0%
think this is a good bill and I think uh
 
05:05:37.110 --> 05:05:37.120 align:start position:0%
you should support it fully you know if
 
05:05:38.350 --> 05:05:38.360 align:start position:0%
anybody has any questions I'm willing to
 
05:05:40.230 --> 05:05:40.240 align:start position:0%
take them
 
05:05:42.390 --> 05:05:42.400 align:start position:0%
could you tell us a little um if you
 
05:05:44.948 --> 05:05:44.958 align:start position:0%
know the history of this law in other
 
05:05:47.110 --> 05:05:47.120 align:start position:0%
words why why did was this enacted if we
 
05:05:49.230 --> 05:05:49.240 align:start position:0%
already needed a federal law or is this
 
05:05:51.430 --> 05:05:51.440 align:start position:0%
from before A Time when the federal U
 
05:05:54.110 --> 05:05:54.120 align:start position:0%
government licensed firearm sales I'm
 
05:05:55.708 --> 05:05:55.718 align:start position:0%
not sure Mr chairman of the legislative
 
05:05:57.830 --> 05:05:57.840 align:start position:0%
history of it it would lead me to
 
05:05:59.230 --> 05:05:59.240 align:start position:0%
believe that it was a time when maybe
 
05:06:00.990 --> 05:06:01.000 align:start position:0%
some places weren't doing so much with
 
05:06:05.750 --> 05:06:05.760 align:start position:0%
zoning and uh issuing out permits and so
 
05:06:07.990 --> 05:06:08.000 align:start position:0%
forth this was a way that if you're in a
 
05:06:09.868 --> 05:06:09.878 align:start position:0%
smaller area I think to notify the law
 
05:06:11.190 --> 05:06:11.200 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer that hey we're
 
05:06:13.030 --> 05:06:13.040 align:start position:0%
running a business of firearms you used
 
05:06:16.070 --> 05:06:16.080 align:start position:0%
to have a lot of uh home businesses
 
05:06:17.548 --> 05:06:17.558 align:start position:0%
today they've kind of gotten away from a
 
05:06:18.788 --> 05:06:18.798 align:start position:0%
lot of them there still there's a few
 
05:06:20.150 --> 05:06:20.160 align:start position:0%
popping up here and there but a majority
 
05:06:22.548 --> 05:06:22.558 align:start position:0%
of them are all brick and motor which is
 
05:06:24.628 --> 05:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
what the ATF seems to uh like to deal
 
05:06:26.788 --> 05:06:26.798 align:start position:0%
with more than home business for a a
 
05:06:28.868 --> 05:06:28.878 align:start position:0%
period as my understanding the FF uh
 
05:06:30.990 --> 05:06:31.000 align:start position:0%
excuse me the ATF wouldn't even approve
 
05:06:32.510 --> 05:06:32.520 align:start position:0%
uh if you didn't have a building that
 
05:06:34.830 --> 05:06:34.840 align:start position:0%
was physically separated from your home
 
05:06:36.750 --> 05:06:36.760 align:start position:0%
is that true I remember some people
 
05:06:38.510 --> 05:06:38.520 align:start position:0%
actually going out of business I believe
 
05:06:41.150 --> 05:06:41.160 align:start position:0%
there was a push I believe uh I think it
 
05:06:43.110 --> 05:06:43.120 align:start position:0%
was either 10 or 15 years ago to try to
 
05:06:45.390 --> 05:06:45.400 align:start position:0%
reduce that but they still allow anybody
 
05:06:47.750 --> 05:06:47.760 align:start position:0%
that had a license out of their house to
 
05:06:49.270 --> 05:06:49.280 align:start position:0%
as long as they're still purposes to
 
05:06:51.190 --> 05:06:51.200 align:start position:0%
make money and to be in business not to
 
05:06:53.628 --> 05:06:53.638 align:start position:0%
increase your personal collection so the
 
05:06:55.628 --> 05:06:55.638 align:start position:0%
ATF really it even says it on the
 
05:06:57.110 --> 05:06:57.120 align:start position:0%
application when you apply for a federal
 
05:06:58.788 --> 05:06:58.798 align:start position:0%
firearms license that if you're not in
 
05:07:01.270 --> 05:07:01.280 align:start position:0%
it to uh be a business and make money do
 
05:07:04.470 --> 05:07:04.480 align:start position:0%
not submit the application gotcha and um
 
05:07:07.070 --> 05:07:07.080 align:start position:0%
finally for me it says repealing the
 
05:07:10.150 --> 05:07:10.160 align:start position:0%
license to sell pistons and revolvers um
 
05:07:12.110 --> 05:07:12.120 align:start position:0%
what about long guns long guns were
 
05:07:13.548 --> 05:07:13.558 align:start position:0%
never an issue it was always pistols and
 
05:07:15.830 --> 05:07:15.840 align:start position:0%
revolvers so I could open up a business
 
05:07:18.750 --> 05:07:18.760 align:start position:0%
tomorrow with my FFL and sell rifles all
 
05:07:20.948 --> 05:07:20.958 align:start position:0%
day long and shotguns all day long and I
 
05:07:22.230 --> 05:07:22.240 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have to worry about it but if I
 
05:07:23.548 --> 05:07:23.558 align:start position:0%
want to sell a pistol I have to get a
 
05:07:25.590 --> 05:07:25.600 align:start position:0%
town license that would be my legal
 
05:07:27.788 --> 05:07:27.798 align:start position:0%
understanding of it yeah okay thank you
 
05:07:30.670 --> 05:07:30.680 align:start position:0%
uh represent Sher uh was it the
 
05:07:32.868 --> 05:07:32.878 align:start position:0%
intention of this bill I I see that the
 
05:07:35.070 --> 05:07:35.080 align:start position:0%
bill repeals RSA
 
05:07:38.670 --> 05:07:38.680 align:start position:0%
1598 correct uh the third paragraph uh
 
05:07:44.230 --> 05:07:44.240 align:start position:0%
of that bill prohibits uh a a a sale of
 
05:07:48.670 --> 05:07:48.680 align:start position:0%
a weapon to a person who is a convicted
 
05:07:51.788 --> 05:07:51.798 align:start position:0%
felon uh was it the intention of this
 
05:07:55.390 --> 05:07:55.400 align:start position:0%
repeal of 1598 to do that it's already a
 
05:07:57.070 --> 05:07:57.080 align:start position:0%
violation of federal law for prohibited
 
05:07:58.628 --> 05:07:58.638 align:start position:0%
person in other words the federal
 
05:07:59.948 --> 05:07:59.958 align:start position:0%
government would take action on that
 
05:08:02.190 --> 05:08:02.200 align:start position:0%
individual such as they do
 
05:08:05.470 --> 05:08:05.480 align:start position:0%
now can I give you an example sure we
 
05:08:06.910 --> 05:08:06.920 align:start position:0%
have individuals that'll come in they'll
 
05:08:08.708 --> 05:08:08.718 align:start position:0%
purchase a firearm they'll end up being
 
05:08:11.750 --> 05:08:11.760 align:start position:0%
delayed the statutory time frame elapses
 
05:08:14.350 --> 05:08:14.360 align:start position:0%
they then receive the firearm they come
 
05:08:15.868 --> 05:08:15.878 align:start position:0%
back as being a prohibited person for
 
05:08:17.270 --> 05:08:17.280 align:start position:0%
either felony conviction or domestic
 
05:08:19.788 --> 05:08:19.798 align:start position:0%
violence conviction misdemeanor the ATF
 
05:08:21.310 --> 05:08:21.320 align:start position:0%
will then arrange with that individual
 
05:08:22.750 --> 05:08:22.760 align:start position:0%
to either meet them or for them to
 
05:08:24.628 --> 05:08:24.638 align:start position:0%
surrender the firearm back and then it's
 
05:08:26.670 --> 05:08:26.680 align:start position:0%
up to the ATF if they want to pursue
 
05:08:28.990 --> 05:08:29.000 align:start position:0%
charges which sometimes they do often
 
05:08:33.750 --> 05:08:33.760 align:start position:0%
they don't okay thank you so the the
 
05:08:35.788 --> 05:08:35.798 align:start position:0%
portion of the statute that would be
 
05:08:38.150 --> 05:08:38.160 align:start position:0%
struck prohibiting the um sale of
 
05:08:40.708 --> 05:08:40.718 align:start position:0%
firearms to felons would not prohibit
 
05:08:42.670 --> 05:08:42.680 align:start position:0%
the sale of firearms to felons I mean it
 
05:08:44.750 --> 05:08:44.760 align:start position:0%
would not the Felon would be committing
 
05:08:46.230 --> 05:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
a crime by purchasing a firearm because
 
05:08:48.830 --> 05:08:48.840 align:start position:0%
it's still legal it's just duplicative
 
05:08:50.470 --> 05:08:50.480 align:start position:0%
okay thank you I have a question yes
 
05:08:52.270 --> 05:08:52.280 align:start position:0%
Representative no you have a question so
 
05:08:54.310 --> 05:08:54.320 align:start position:0%
my question is the the thing that we get
 
05:08:56.310 --> 05:08:56.320 align:start position:0%
is that you know the fact
 
05:09:00.910 --> 05:09:00.920 align:start position:0%
that the state has at one time when I
 
05:09:04.070 --> 05:09:04.080 align:start position:0%
was a young rep fairly
 
05:09:07.110 --> 05:09:07.120 align:start position:0%
young I had an argument with with with
 
05:09:11.510 --> 05:09:11.520 align:start position:0%
the chair a chair about we have no I I
 
05:09:14.270 --> 05:09:14.280 align:start position:0%
said we have no firearm laws in this
 
05:09:17.350 --> 05:09:17.360 align:start position:0%
state and he pointed to this law as
 
05:09:20.070 --> 05:09:20.080 align:start position:0%
being the one yeah we do we got one law
 
05:09:23.230 --> 05:09:23.240 align:start position:0%
so so there is one law you can the law
 
05:09:24.868 --> 05:09:24.878 align:start position:0%
specifically says the people have to be
 
05:09:26.150 --> 05:09:26.160 align:start position:0%
known to you if you're going to sell it
 
05:09:29.110 --> 05:09:29.120 align:start position:0%
so if someone sends to his na sells
 
05:09:31.110 --> 05:09:31.120 align:start position:0%
something to his neighbor we have a
 
05:09:32.830 --> 05:09:32.840 align:start position:0%
state law that says you can do that if
 
05:09:34.510 --> 05:09:34.520 align:start position:0%
he doesn't know him personally and
 
05:09:36.590 --> 05:09:36.600 align:start position:0%
doesn't get
 
05:09:38.830 --> 05:09:38.840 align:start position:0%
identification so that being the case
 
05:09:40.990 --> 05:09:41.000 align:start position:0%
can he be prosecuted if we don't have a
 
05:09:43.830 --> 05:09:43.840 align:start position:0%
state law can can the state do any
 
05:09:46.190 --> 05:09:46.200 align:start position:0%
prosecution or or is it like people
 
05:09:49.270 --> 05:09:49.280 align:start position:0%
going into a school that the feds have
 
05:09:51.830 --> 05:09:51.840 align:start position:0%
to do it because because we don't have a
 
05:09:54.948 --> 05:09:54.958 align:start position:0%
law so actually so what's the effect of
 
05:09:58.310 --> 05:09:58.320 align:start position:0%
taking this law out of the state as far
 
05:10:00.430 --> 05:10:00.440 align:start position:0%
as New Hampshire actually takes it a
 
05:10:02.270 --> 05:10:02.280 align:start position:0%
step further with it's a felon in
 
05:10:04.070 --> 05:10:04.080 align:start position:0%
possession of dangerous weapon or deadly
 
05:10:07.270 --> 05:10:07.280 align:start position:0%
weapon that includes Firearms so that
 
05:10:09.310 --> 05:10:09.320 align:start position:0%
law is an independent law from this one
 
05:10:13.430 --> 05:10:13.440 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:16.830 --> 05:10:16.840 align:start position:0%
also F follow I'm just wondering what
 
05:10:19.110 --> 05:10:19.120 align:start position:0%
you think it's 159 well no it's chapter
 
05:10:22.510 --> 05:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
159 I believe that section applies to it
 
05:10:24.948 --> 05:10:24.958 align:start position:0%
well this is it's quite a long chapter
 
05:10:28.990 --> 05:10:29.000 align:start position:0%
 
05:10:31.750 --> 05:10:31.760 align:start position:0%
okay thank you
 
05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:33.958 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr K and thank you for
 
05:10:36.150 --> 05:10:36.160 align:start position:0%
taking my question um I just had a
 
05:10:38.030 --> 05:10:38.040 align:start position:0%
question around the zoning bit so when
 
05:10:40.788 --> 05:10:40.798 align:start position:0%
um municipal when you're saying that the
 
05:10:42.868 --> 05:10:42.878 align:start position:0%
um the feds are basically checking the
 
05:10:44.390 --> 05:10:44.400 align:start position:0%
zoning restrictions when they're issuing
 
05:10:47.548 --> 05:10:47.558 align:start position:0%
these licenses are there is that like
 
05:10:49.390 --> 05:10:49.400 align:start position:0%
just whether something is zoned for
 
05:10:51.670 --> 05:10:51.680 align:start position:0%
business or not or do M municipalities
 
05:10:54.868 --> 05:10:54.878 align:start position:0%
specifically zone for gun business gun
 
05:10:57.470 --> 05:10:57.480 align:start position:0%
related businesses what it is is the ATF
 
05:10:59.430 --> 05:10:59.440 align:start position:0%
for concern that you went to your local
 
05:11:02.910 --> 05:11:02.920 align:start position:0%
Municipal agency got all their approvals
 
05:11:06.510 --> 05:11:06.520 align:start position:0%
all their go-aheads because if you don't
 
05:11:07.990 --> 05:11:08.000 align:start position:0%
then that creates an issue for licensing
 
05:11:10.190 --> 05:11:10.200 align:start position:0%
for the premise uh as far as if you're
 
05:11:12.750 --> 05:11:12.760 align:start position:0%
asking like maybe in a in a school zone
 
05:11:14.350 --> 05:11:14.360 align:start position:0%
ffls are actually exempt from school
 
05:11:16.788 --> 05:11:16.798 align:start position:0%
zones under federal law so that's not a
 
05:11:18.868 --> 05:11:18.878 align:start position:0%
real big consideration what it is they
 
05:11:20.830 --> 05:11:20.840 align:start position:0%
want to make sure if you lease say
 
05:11:22.350 --> 05:11:22.360 align:start position:0%
someone's leasing a property from
 
05:11:24.510 --> 05:11:24.520 align:start position:0%
another person they want to make sure
 
05:11:26.070 --> 05:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
that individual also has a signed copy
 
05:11:27.110 --> 05:11:27.120 align:start position:0%
and notification that you're going to be
 
05:11:28.788 --> 05:11:28.798 align:start position:0%
running a Firearms business out of their
 
05:11:30.350 --> 05:11:30.360 align:start position:0%
rented premise if you don't own the
 
05:11:32.948 --> 05:11:32.958 align:start position:0%
building itself so the zoning is a very
 
05:11:37.310 --> 05:11:37.320 align:start position:0%
key point to it so essentially so so say
 
05:11:38.670 --> 05:11:38.680 align:start position:0%
I wanted to open a gun store I would
 
05:11:40.350 --> 05:11:40.360 align:start position:0%
still have to go go to the like the
 
05:11:41.788 --> 05:11:41.798 align:start position:0%
local municipality and go through all
 
05:11:43.948 --> 05:11:43.958 align:start position:0%
the normal like things that you would do
 
05:11:45.628 --> 05:11:45.638 align:start position:0%
to open a business and then get licensed
 
05:11:48.670 --> 05:11:48.680 align:start position:0%
through the FFL so this is really just
 
05:11:50.788 --> 05:11:50.798 align:start position:0%
like this isn't removing the
 
05:11:52.830 --> 05:11:52.840 align:start position:0%
municipality's ability to already have
 
05:11:54.788 --> 05:11:54.798 align:start position:0%
like jurisdiction over like absolutely
 
05:11:55.948 --> 05:11:55.958 align:start position:0%
not you have to still comply with the
 
05:11:55.958 --> 05:11:58.470 align:start position:0%
not you have to still comply with the
zoning

05:11:58.470 --> 05:11:58.480 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:00.788 --> 05:12:00.798 align:start position:0%
requirements any further
 
05:12:05.430 --> 05:12:05.440 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you thank
 
05:12:21.030 --> 05:12:21.040 align:start position:0%
 
05:12:23.270 --> 05:12:23.280 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair Jr hle for the record
 
05:12:25.948 --> 05:12:25.958 align:start position:0%
dun Barton um currently the secretary
 
05:12:27.430 --> 05:12:27.440 align:start position:0%
for the New Hampshire Firearms Coalition
 
05:12:30.350 --> 05:12:30.360 align:start position:0%
as well as the former State Rep um I
 
05:12:31.670 --> 05:12:31.680 align:start position:0%
would like to address a comment that was
 
05:12:33.670 --> 05:12:33.680 align:start position:0%
made by one of the members saying that
 
05:12:37.350 --> 05:12:37.360 align:start position:0%
this repeals the ability or the repeals
 
05:12:39.830 --> 05:12:39.840 align:start position:0%
the the prohibition on sale to a person
 
05:12:42.470 --> 05:12:42.480 align:start position:0%
who has a felony that is under
 
05:12:44.470 --> 05:12:44.480 align:start position:0%
1597 not
 
05:12:47.788 --> 05:12:47.798 align:start position:0%
1598 that will remain on the law so that
 
05:12:49.190 --> 05:12:49.200 align:start position:0%
question that was raised in the prior
 
05:12:52.470 --> 05:12:52.480 align:start position:0%
discussion is n and void um this is a
 
05:12:55.548 --> 05:12:55.558 align:start position:0%
completely redundant system to what is
 
05:12:57.708 --> 05:12:57.718 align:start position:0%
currently in place between the business
 
05:12:59.430 --> 05:12:59.440 align:start position:0%
requirements if you want to establish a
 
05:13:02.070 --> 05:13:02.080 align:start position:0%
home business in our zoning laws and
 
05:13:03.628 --> 05:13:03.638 align:start position:0%
what is done with the federal government
 
05:13:05.830 --> 05:13:05.840 align:start position:0%
to get permission to sell firearms this
 
05:13:08.030 --> 05:13:08.040 align:start position:0%
is a pro business Bill there is no
 
05:13:10.310 --> 05:13:10.320 align:start position:0%
reason why we should take take firearms
 
05:13:11.948 --> 05:13:11.958 align:start position:0%
and the sales of firearms and make it
 
05:13:13.510 --> 05:13:13.520 align:start position:0%
more difficult than any other Home
 
05:13:15.750 --> 05:13:15.760 align:start position:0%
occupation if someone wanted to cut hair
 
05:13:18.270 --> 05:13:18.280 align:start position:0%
at home and that was their business they
 
05:13:19.948 --> 05:13:19.958 align:start position:0%
would have to still go to the town to
 
05:13:21.750 --> 05:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
get permission to set up and establish a
 
05:13:23.270 --> 05:13:23.280 align:start position:0%
business in their
 
05:13:25.190 --> 05:13:25.200 align:start position:0%
residence just like you would for the
 
05:13:27.270 --> 05:13:27.280 align:start position:0%
Firearms the only difference is you have
 
05:13:29.270 --> 05:13:29.280 align:start position:0%
extra Hoops to jump through for firearms
 
05:13:31.510 --> 05:13:31.520 align:start position:0%
that are different than any other
 
05:13:34.548 --> 05:13:34.558 align:start position:0%
business foot traffic car traffic to a
 
05:13:36.628 --> 05:13:36.638 align:start position:0%
home FFL is going to be a lot smaller
 
05:13:38.270 --> 05:13:38.280 align:start position:0%
than let's say someone who's running a
 
05:13:40.390 --> 05:13:40.400 align:start position:0%
hair salon out of their
 
05:13:43.190 --> 05:13:43.200 align:start position:0%
house one two three times a month
 
05:13:45.150 --> 05:13:45.160 align:start position:0%
someone might show up that's a viable
 
05:13:47.750 --> 05:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
business in New Hampshire we currently
 
05:13:49.548 --> 05:13:49.558 align:start position:0%
have and all of these businesses are
 
05:13:51.470 --> 05:13:51.480 align:start position:0%
listed you can go to the ATF website
 
05:13:53.310 --> 05:13:53.320 align:start position:0%
right now and find every FFL in the
 
05:13:55.230 --> 05:13:55.240 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire as of this
 
05:13:58.590 --> 05:13:58.600 align:start position:0%
morning there are 606 of them they vary
 
05:14:01.150 --> 05:14:01.160 align:start position:0%
by the number of town okay some towns
 
05:14:03.910 --> 05:14:03.920 align:start position:0%
have a lot some towns don't have any
 
05:14:05.390 --> 05:14:05.400 align:start position:0%
that is not because there's a there's
 
05:14:07.788 --> 05:14:07.798 align:start position:0%
fewer there's less demand in the town of
 
05:14:09.390 --> 05:14:09.400 align:start position:0%
conquer or in the city of conquer than
 
05:14:11.390 --> 05:14:11.400 align:start position:0%
there is in the city of Manchester it's
 
05:14:13.390 --> 05:14:13.400 align:start position:0%
because some places make it very hard to
 
05:14:14.350 --> 05:14:14.360 align:start position:0%
get a
 
05:14:17.628 --> 05:14:17.638 align:start position:0%
business set up to be a home
 
05:14:20.590 --> 05:14:20.600 align:start position:0%
FFL um we would ask that you would
 
05:14:22.470 --> 05:14:22.480 align:start position:0%
support this bill this is a pro business
 
05:14:24.030 --> 05:14:24.040 align:start position:0%
bill that will make it easier for
 
05:14:26.830 --> 05:14:26.840 align:start position:0%
businesses we are ready Are a large
 
05:14:29.110 --> 05:14:29.120 align:start position:0%
firearm manufacturer and distributor
 
05:14:31.830 --> 05:14:31.840 align:start position:0%
relative to other states that makes we
 
05:14:33.470 --> 05:14:33.480 align:start position:0%
are also one of the safest states in the
 
05:14:35.230 --> 05:14:35.240 align:start position:0%
nation if not the safest state in the
 
05:14:37.470 --> 05:14:37.480 align:start position:0%
nation and I would like to continue that
 
05:14:40.190 --> 05:14:40.200 align:start position:0%
proud tradition thank
 
05:14:40.200 --> 05:14:41.910 align:start position:0%
proud tradition thank
you

05:14:41.910 --> 05:14:41.920 align:start position:0%
you
 
05:14:41.920 --> 05:14:43.430 align:start position:0%
you
thankk

05:14:43.430 --> 05:14:43.440 align:start position:0%
thankk
 
05:14:46.788 --> 05:14:46.798 align:start position:0%
yeah thank you Mr chairman
 
05:14:49.470 --> 05:14:49.480 align:start position:0%
um could could you just clarify what
 
05:14:51.150 --> 05:14:51.160 align:start position:0%
what RSA did you say we there was
 
05:14:53.868 --> 05:14:53.878 align:start position:0%
confusion about or there it was so one
 
05:14:56.430 --> 05:14:56.440 align:start position:0%
of the one of the prior questions asked
 
05:14:59.070 --> 05:14:59.080 align:start position:0%
was does this repeal sales to felons
 
05:15:01.910 --> 05:15:01.920 align:start position:0%
that prohibition it does not that is
 
05:15:04.948 --> 05:15:04.958 align:start position:0%
1597 that is not impacted by the bill
 
05:15:07.590 --> 05:15:07.600 align:start position:0%
the bill repeals
 
05:15:11.230 --> 05:15:11.240 align:start position:0%
15988 um I believe it's 8B and 10 if I
 
05:15:13.230 --> 05:15:13.240 align:start position:0%
recall and then then any references to
 
05:15:15.310 --> 05:15:15.320 align:start position:0%
those so sales to felon still stays on
 
05:15:17.990 --> 05:15:18.000 align:start position:0%
our books prohibiting sales to felons
 
05:15:20.990 --> 05:15:21.000 align:start position:0%
Ste says on the books thank
 
05:15:24.510 --> 05:15:24.520 align:start position:0%
you representative Harry
 
05:15:27.350 --> 05:15:27.360 align:start position:0%
gather um I just want to clarify because
 
05:15:29.110 --> 05:15:29.120 align:start position:0%
I'm reading RSA
 
05:15:31.510 --> 05:15:31.520 align:start position:0%
15910 and it says relative to penalties
 
05:15:33.150 --> 05:15:33.160 align:start position:0%
for sale without a license required
 
05:15:34.990 --> 05:15:35.000 align:start position:0%
under RSA
 
05:15:37.350 --> 05:15:37.360 align:start position:0%
1598 and then the other piece of that
 
05:15:40.310 --> 05:15:40.320 align:start position:0%
when it talks about um
 
05:15:43.110 --> 05:15:43.120 align:start position:0%
Rel relative to wait minute I find where
 
05:15:47.190 --> 05:15:47.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:15:49.948 --> 05:15:49.958 align:start position:0%
reading so that is a class B felony
 
05:15:53.548 --> 05:15:53.558 align:start position:0%
today and this bill would repeal
 
05:15:56.070 --> 05:15:56.080 align:start position:0%
15910 okay but there is a federal
 
05:15:58.150 --> 05:15:58.160 align:start position:0%
prohibition and there is now there is
 
05:16:00.070 --> 05:16:00.080 align:start position:0%
also a state prohibition about selling
 
05:16:02.590 --> 05:16:02.600 align:start position:0%
to someone who is a prohibited person
 
05:16:04.628 --> 05:16:04.638 align:start position:0%
right you can't sell to a felon that is
 
05:16:09.390 --> 05:16:09.400 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:13.548 --> 05:16:13.558 align:start position:0%
okay 1597 prohibits this and it says
 
05:16:15.510 --> 05:16:15.520 align:start position:0%
whoever violates the provisions of this
 
05:16:17.670 --> 05:16:17.680 align:start position:0%
section shall be guilty of a class B
 
05:16:21.510 --> 05:16:21.520 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:25.628 --> 05:16:25.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:28.310 --> 05:16:28.320 align:start position:0%
Muse thank you for answering uh
 
05:16:31.430 --> 05:16:31.440 align:start position:0%
answering my question um what it looks
 
05:16:34.670 --> 05:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
like we may be losing if we were repal
 
05:16:37.470 --> 05:16:37.480 align:start position:0%
1589 is the requirement that the
 
05:16:41.510 --> 05:16:41.520 align:start position:0%
firearm uh shall uh be delivered to a a
 
05:16:44.110 --> 05:16:44.120 align:start position:0%
a purchaser not personally known to the
 
05:16:50.350 --> 05:16:50.360 align:start position:0%
 
05:16:53.750 --> 05:16:53.760 align:start position:0%
uh or who doesn't or who doesn't provide
 
05:16:55.708 --> 05:16:55.718 align:start position:0%
uh you know clear evidence of their
 
05:16:59.310 --> 05:16:59.320 align:start position:0%
identity so um you know obviously we
 
05:17:01.910 --> 05:17:01.920 align:start position:0%
would want to know who these people are
 
05:17:04.670 --> 05:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
correct so
 
05:17:07.708 --> 05:17:07.718 align:start position:0%
um this I'm aware of a case down in
 
05:17:10.030 --> 05:17:10.040 align:start position:0%
Brookline from a number of years ago
 
05:17:11.190 --> 05:17:11.200 align:start position:0%
I'll attempt to answer your question
 
05:17:14.150 --> 05:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
with it with a set of events someone
 
05:17:17.150 --> 05:17:17.160 align:start position:0%
listed as a store owner a firearm for
 
05:17:20.628 --> 05:17:20.638 align:start position:0%
sale on a 3x5 card that person as the
 
05:17:22.708 --> 05:17:22.718 align:start position:0%
store owner was subsequently convicted
 
05:17:24.990 --> 05:17:25.000 align:start position:0%
just because they were advertising for
 
05:17:27.990 --> 05:17:28.000 align:start position:0%
sale which is what the statute says it's
 
05:17:30.830 --> 05:17:30.840 align:start position:0%
not about transfer at that point gun
 
05:17:34.150 --> 05:17:34.160 align:start position:0%
owners tend to be very um religious
 
05:17:35.868 --> 05:17:35.878 align:start position:0%
about making sure they don't want they
 
05:17:37.470 --> 05:17:37.480 align:start position:0%
don't want their firearms hand ending up
 
05:17:39.628 --> 05:17:39.638 align:start position:0%
in the wrong hands so so they tend to go
 
05:17:41.150 --> 05:17:41.160 align:start position:0%
overboard to make sure if they're going
 
05:17:42.868 --> 05:17:42.878 align:start position:0%
to sell one privately that they know
 
05:17:44.590 --> 05:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
that the person is not prohibited
 
05:17:46.430 --> 05:17:46.440 align:start position:0%
because it's in their self-interest to
 
05:17:46.440 --> 05:17:47.390 align:start position:0%
because it's in their self-interest to
do

05:17:47.390 --> 05:17:47.400 align:start position:0%
do
 
05:17:50.470 --> 05:17:50.480 align:start position:0%
so does that answer your
 
05:17:53.510 --> 05:17:53.520 align:start position:0%
question um a little bit it looks but it
 
05:17:55.190 --> 05:17:55.200 align:start position:0%
does look like that provision would be
 
05:17:57.110 --> 05:17:57.120 align:start position:0%
disappearing from the law so in other
 
05:17:58.590 --> 05:17:58.600 align:start position:0%
words where would that position it it
 
05:18:00.390 --> 05:18:00.400 align:start position:0%
would it would change from something
 
05:18:01.990 --> 05:18:02.000 align:start position:0%
that's in statute to best practice
 
05:18:03.230 --> 05:18:03.240 align:start position:0%
representative where does it where does
 
05:18:07.110 --> 05:18:07.120 align:start position:0%
it take that that away please 159 15 15
 
05:18:11.510 --> 05:18:11.520 align:start position:0%
no 15910 if I may right any person who
 
05:18:14.190 --> 05:18:14.200 align:start position:0%
without being licensed here in provided
 
05:18:17.190 --> 05:18:17.200 align:start position:0%
right the license is is the license that
 
05:18:19.590 --> 05:18:19.600 align:start position:0%
we're going we're doing away with um
 
05:18:22.430 --> 05:18:22.440 align:start position:0%
advertises or exposes for sale or has in
 
05:18:24.990 --> 05:18:25.000 align:start position:0%
his possession with the intent to sell
 
05:18:25.000 --> 05:18:26.830 align:start position:0%
his possession with the intent to sell
is

05:18:26.830 --> 05:18:26.840 align:start position:0%
is
 
05:18:28.990 --> 05:18:29.000 align:start position:0%
guilty this is not about selling a
 
05:18:30.750 --> 05:18:30.760 align:start position:0%
firearm to the wrong person to a
 
05:18:33.590 --> 05:18:33.600 align:start position:0%
prohibited person the way 15910 is
 
05:18:36.270 --> 05:18:36.280 align:start position:0%
written it's about the advertisement of
 
05:18:38.948 --> 05:18:38.958 align:start position:0%
a firearm which is what has been used in
 
05:18:41.070 --> 05:18:41.080 align:start position:0%
the past to convict people of of
 
05:18:45.990 --> 05:18:46.000 align:start position:0%
felonies I would argue under 1598 d a
 
05:18:47.670 --> 05:18:47.680 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure the Attorney General is
 
05:18:49.310 --> 05:18:49.320 align:start position:0%
doing this but
 
05:18:49.320 --> 05:18:51.310 align:start position:0%
doing this but
1598a

05:18:51.310 --> 05:18:51.320 align:start position:0%
1598a
 
05:18:55.110 --> 05:18:55.120 align:start position:0%
says um the Attorney General shall at
 
05:18:56.788 --> 05:18:56.798 align:start position:0%
least once annually file with the
 
05:18:58.390 --> 05:18:58.400 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State a summary of all the
 
05:19:00.190 --> 05:19:00.200 align:start position:0%
laws of each state of the United States
 
05:19:01.788 --> 05:19:01.798 align:start position:0%
relative to the purchase of pistols and
 
05:19:03.910 --> 05:19:03.920 align:start position:0%
revolvers in such
 
05:19:07.230 --> 05:19:07.240 align:start position:0%
States I could do a 91a but I'm pretty
 
05:19:09.670 --> 05:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
certain that doc that document doesn't
 
05:19:11.548 --> 05:19:11.558 align:start position:0%
exist and hasn't for a while we have a
 
05:19:13.310 --> 05:19:13.320 align:start position:0%
lot of these extraneous requirements of
 
05:19:14.788 --> 05:19:14.798 align:start position:0%
departments that are out there that say
 
05:19:16.670 --> 05:19:16.680 align:start position:0%
you have to do X Y and Z that aren't
 
05:19:19.030 --> 05:19:19.040 align:start position:0%
getting done so yet one more reason to
 
05:19:22.230 --> 05:19:22.240 align:start position:0%
clean up the books I'm not sure that you
 
05:19:24.430 --> 05:19:24.440 align:start position:0%
you quoted the the statute that would be
 
05:19:27.230 --> 05:19:27.240 align:start position:0%
disappearing in uh 150
 
05:19:30.548 --> 05:19:30.558 align:start position:0%
1598 uh according to the way that it's
 
05:19:33.788 --> 05:19:33.798 align:start position:0%
worded so in in Roman numeral 3 what it
 
05:19:36.910 --> 05:19:36.920 align:start position:0%
says precisely is no pistol revolver or
 
05:19:38.750 --> 05:19:38.760 align:start position:0%
other firearm shall be delivered to a
 
05:19:40.830 --> 05:19:40.840 align:start position:0%
purchaser not personally known to the
 
05:19:43.230 --> 05:19:43.240 align:start position:0%
seller or who does not present clear
 
05:19:46.230 --> 05:19:46.240 align:start position:0%
evidence of his identity that would be
 
05:19:50.110 --> 05:19:50.120 align:start position:0%
disappearing if we if we simply repeal
 
05:19:50.120 --> 05:19:51.868 align:start position:0%
disappearing if we if we simply repeal
this

05:19:51.868 --> 05:19:51.878 align:start position:0%
this
 
05:19:56.628 --> 05:19:56.638 align:start position:0%
 
05:20:01.030 --> 05:20:01.040 align:start position:0%
1598 license to sell Roman
 
05:20:04.070 --> 05:20:04.080 align:start position:0%
3 correct it also shows up in
 
05:20:07.788 --> 05:20:07.798 align:start position:0%
15910 right which is part of the repeal
 
05:20:09.990 --> 05:20:10.000 align:start position:0%
any person who without being licensed as
 
05:20:12.430 --> 05:20:12.440 align:start position:0%
herein provided sells advertises or
 
05:20:14.910 --> 05:20:14.920 align:start position:0%
exposes for sale right or has in his
 
05:20:16.868 --> 05:20:16.878 align:start position:0%
possession with intent to sell pistols
 
05:20:18.470 --> 05:20:18.480 align:start position:0%
revolver shall be guilty of a class B
 
05:20:21.750 --> 05:20:21.760 align:start position:0%
felony that is simply about right just
 
05:20:23.750 --> 05:20:23.760 align:start position:0%
the mere advertisement is considered a
 
05:20:25.948 --> 05:20:25.958 align:start position:0%
felony there's no transfer taking place
 
05:20:29.030 --> 05:20:29.040 align:start position:0%
under 15910 that's also repealed under
 
05:20:31.350 --> 05:20:31.360 align:start position:0%
the statute correct so where in our laws
 
05:20:33.230 --> 05:20:33.240 align:start position:0%
does it still say that you can't
 
05:20:34.830 --> 05:20:34.840 align:start position:0%
transfer a firearm to someone you don't
 
05:20:37.270 --> 05:20:37.280 align:start position:0%
know it would not be there at this point
 
05:20:40.470 --> 05:20:40.480 align:start position:0%
right because that's under 159 983 okay
 
05:20:43.470 --> 05:20:43.480 align:start position:0%
all right but as I said earlier firearm
 
05:20:45.230 --> 05:20:45.240 align:start position:0%
owners don't tend to want their firearms
 
05:20:46.868 --> 05:20:46.878 align:start position:0%
in the hands of the wrong
 
05:20:49.430 --> 05:20:49.440 align:start position:0%
people um they respect what a firearm
 
05:20:51.150 --> 05:20:51.160 align:start position:0%
can do because they don't want it in the
 
05:20:52.708 --> 05:20:52.718 align:start position:0%
hands of the wrong people they tend to
 
05:20:53.990 --> 05:20:54.000 align:start position:0%
make sure that the people that are
 
05:20:56.708 --> 05:20:56.718 align:start position:0%
buying it are not prohibited I can I can
 
05:20:59.628 --> 05:20:59.638 align:start position:0%
tell you that it to me one of the
 
05:21:01.948 --> 05:21:01.958 align:start position:0%
strongest arguments against an earlier
 
05:21:05.430 --> 05:21:05.440 align:start position:0%
bill that we heard um which was
 
05:21:08.350 --> 05:21:08.360 align:start position:0%
requiring mandatory background checks is
 
05:21:08.360 --> 05:21:09.110 align:start position:0%
requiring mandatory background checks is
that

05:21:09.110 --> 05:21:09.120 align:start position:0%
that
 
05:21:10.670 --> 05:21:10.680 align:start position:0%
we are already prohibited from
 
05:21:12.990 --> 05:21:13.000 align:start position:0%
transferring Firearms to some we don't
 
05:21:15.708 --> 05:21:15.718 align:start position:0%
know so you're taking that one argument
 
05:21:19.390 --> 05:21:19.400 align:start position:0%
away and relying only on we tend to be
 
05:21:21.670 --> 05:21:21.680 align:start position:0%
responsible I I feel like that's a
 
05:21:23.788 --> 05:21:23.798 align:start position:0%
pretty slippery
 
05:21:26.230 --> 05:21:26.240 align:start position:0%
slope can you there's nowhere else in
 
05:21:27.910 --> 05:21:27.920 align:start position:0%
our law other than this place right here
 
05:21:30.070 --> 05:21:30.080 align:start position:0%
well so you're prohibited under Federal
 
05:21:31.830 --> 05:21:31.840 align:start position:0%
and under state law for selling to
 
05:21:33.788 --> 05:21:33.798 align:start position:0%
someone who's not a qualified right is
 
05:21:35.990 --> 05:21:36.000 align:start position:0%
not a known selling or prohibited a
 
05:21:37.628 --> 05:21:37.638 align:start position:0%
prohibited person so if you if you sell
 
05:21:39.350 --> 05:21:39.360 align:start position:0%
to a prohibited person you're already
 
05:21:41.430 --> 05:21:41.440 align:start position:0%
violating the law it is a punishable by
 
05:21:43.590 --> 05:21:43.600 align:start position:0%
a felony level offense so that's not
 
05:21:45.990 --> 05:21:46.000 align:start position:0%
going away which means the burden is on
 
05:21:47.670 --> 05:21:47.680 align:start position:0%
the the person selling the item to make
 
05:21:49.350 --> 05:21:49.360 align:start position:0%
sure the person that is receiving the
 
05:21:51.868 --> 05:21:51.878 align:start position:0%
item is not prohibited okay thank you
 
05:21:54.750 --> 05:21:54.760 align:start position:0%
any further questions uh that you
 
05:21:56.948 --> 05:21:56.958 align:start position:0%
already heard the answer to well I'm
 
05:21:59.110 --> 05:21:59.120 align:start position:0%
trying to figure out I mean where where
 
05:22:01.350 --> 05:22:01.360 align:start position:0%
you just now said that we have a state
 
05:22:03.310 --> 05:22:03.320 align:start position:0%
law that says you are prohibited from
 
05:22:06.030 --> 05:22:06.040 align:start position:0%
sale to a felon and I'm just wondering
 
05:22:08.910 --> 05:22:08.920 align:start position:0%
where that is 1597
 
05:22:10.750 --> 05:22:10.760 align:start position:0%
and we haven't repealed that one here
 
05:22:12.788 --> 05:22:12.798 align:start position:0%
correct that is not part of the bill
 
05:22:14.190 --> 05:22:14.200 align:start position:0%
I'll take a closer look at that thank
 
05:22:16.948 --> 05:22:16.958 align:start position:0%
you very much sure thank you for your
 
05:22:31.150 --> 05:22:31.160 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:35.948 --> 05:22:35.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:41.230 --> 05:22:41.240 align:start position:0%
 
05:22:43.590 --> 05:22:43.600 align:start position:0%
you going to wave off okay anyone else
 
05:22:45.030 --> 05:22:45.040 align:start position:0%
wishing to testify on this bill was not
 
05:22:47.350 --> 05:22:47.360 align:start position:0%
done oh
 
05:22:50.230 --> 05:22:50.240 align:start position:0%
what oh Mr
 
05:23:06.948 --> 05:23:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
05:23:09.150 --> 05:23:09.160 align:start position:0%
simin thank you Miss Mr chairman and
 
05:23:10.390 --> 05:23:10.400 align:start position:0%
members of the
 
05:23:12.948 --> 05:23:12.958 align:start position:0%
committee uh I am a federal firearms
 
05:23:15.910 --> 05:23:15.920 align:start position:0%
licensee my name is Jay simpkin resident
 
05:23:19.430 --> 05:23:19.440 align:start position:0%
of Nash New Hampshire held an FFL for a
 
05:23:22.910 --> 05:23:22.920 align:start position:0%
shade over 40 years over 30 of them in
 
05:23:26.670 --> 05:23:26.680 align:start position:0%
nsha I have a personal interest in this
 
05:23:29.708 --> 05:23:29.718 align:start position:0%
bill it will save me a $10 license fee
 
05:23:34.390 --> 05:23:34.400 align:start position:0%
every 3 years 10 to1 in postage every 3
 
05:23:37.070 --> 05:23:37.080 align:start position:0%
years and about an hour of my
 
05:23:39.948 --> 05:23:39.958 align:start position:0%
time as others have
 
05:23:39.958 --> 05:23:41.708 align:start position:0%
time as others have
indicated

05:23:41.708 --> 05:23:41.718 align:start position:0%
indicated
 
05:23:45.230 --> 05:23:45.240 align:start position:0%
this repeal will simply clear up a
 
05:23:48.910 --> 05:23:48.920 align:start position:0%
redundancy the redundancy exists because
 
05:23:53.750 --> 05:23:53.760 align:start position:0%
when this law was enacted in 1923 and
 
05:23:56.548 --> 05:23:56.558 align:start position:0%
with my prepared testimony I provide you
 
05:23:58.548 --> 05:23:58.558 align:start position:0%
with a copy of the relevant section of
 
05:24:02.548 --> 05:24:02.558 align:start position:0%
the 1923 law there were no federal laws
 
05:24:04.948 --> 05:24:04.958 align:start position:0%
regarding Firearms the first such
 
05:24:07.670 --> 05:24:07.680 align:start position:0%
federal law was the Federal Firearms Act
 
05:24:09.590 --> 05:24:09.600 align:start position:0%
of 30 June
 
05:24:12.990 --> 05:24:13.000 align:start position:0%
1938 which established lure at the
 
05:24:15.628 --> 05:24:15.638 align:start position:0%
federal level for firearm
 
05:24:18.750 --> 05:24:18.760 align:start position:0%
dealers that lure was rolled into the
 
05:24:21.470 --> 05:24:21.480 align:start position:0%
gun control Act of
 
05:24:24.990 --> 05:24:25.000 align:start position:0%
1968 and I provide the actual sites to
 
05:24:28.030 --> 05:24:28.040 align:start position:0%
statutes at large in which series are
 
05:24:29.670 --> 05:24:29.680 align:start position:0%
published us
 
05:24:34.310 --> 05:24:34.320 align:start position:0%
laws so removing the state license this
 
05:24:36.070 --> 05:24:36.080 align:start position:0%
license by the way has nothing to do
 
05:24:38.430 --> 05:24:38.440 align:start position:0%
with municipalities
 
05:24:41.190 --> 05:24:41.200 align:start position:0%
police Chiefs issue it on behalf of the
 
05:24:45.628 --> 05:24:45.638 align:start position:0%
state it's not a city of nashal
 
05:24:50.190 --> 05:24:50.200 align:start position:0%
 
05:24:54.270 --> 05:24:54.280 align:start position:0%
the the repeal of 159
 
05:24:58.510 --> 05:24:58.520 align:start position:0%
col8 simply removes a redundancy a
 
05:25:01.030 --> 05:25:01.040 align:start position:0%
redundancy that could have been removed
 
05:25:05.270 --> 05:25:05.280 align:start position:0%
15 years ago or even a little more but
 
05:25:09.070 --> 05:25:09.080 align:start position:0%
the application for an FFL and and I
 
05:25:12.548 --> 05:25:12.558 align:start position:0%
append an extract from the most current
 
05:25:15.708 --> 05:25:15.718 align:start position:0%
version requires that a copy of the
 
05:25:17.590 --> 05:25:17.600 align:start position:0%
application go to the chief law
 
05:25:20.990 --> 05:25:21.000 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer it simply was a way
 
05:25:21.000 --> 05:25:22.070 align:start position:0%
enforcement officer it simply was a way
in

05:25:22.070 --> 05:25:22.080 align:start position:0%
in
 
05:25:25.628 --> 05:25:25.638 align:start position:0%
1923 of enabling a police chief to know
 
05:25:28.470 --> 05:25:28.480 align:start position:0%
who in his or her
 
05:25:31.270 --> 05:25:31.280 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction was retailing
 
05:25:33.670 --> 05:25:33.680 align:start position:0%
handguns that's what it was intended to
 
05:25:37.350 --> 05:25:37.360 align:start position:0%
do that's what it did but since the
 
05:25:40.230 --> 05:25:40.240 align:start position:0%
federal Authority require a copy of a
 
05:25:43.470 --> 05:25:43.480 align:start position:0%
new or renewal application for an FFL to
 
05:25:46.510 --> 05:25:46.520 align:start position:0%
go to the chief law enforcement officer
 
05:25:49.270 --> 05:25:49.280 align:start position:0%
there is no reason for the state
 
05:25:53.310 --> 05:25:53.320 align:start position:0%
license um I have prepared testimony
 
05:25:55.590 --> 05:25:55.600 align:start position:0%
which I will hand over and I'm more than
 
05:25:58.590 --> 05:25:58.600 align:start position:0%
willing to answer

there thank you Mr chairman uh I think

that most of the points I want to make
 
05:26:28.670 --> 05:26:28.680 align:start position:0%
uh have already been made so I'll be
 
05:26:32.310 --> 05:26:32.320 align:start position:0%
very brief uh first of all uh I want to
 
05:26:33.788 --> 05:26:33.798 align:start position:0%
State for the record this testimony is
 
05:26:35.030 --> 05:26:35.040 align:start position:0%
representing My Views and the views of
 
05:26:38.030 --> 05:26:38.040 align:start position:0%
my constituents uh in graph 19 is not

made on behalf of any private employer
 
05:26:40.868 --> 05:26:40.878 align:start position:0%

the views of any of my employers uh the
 
05:26:46.548 --> 05:26:46.558 align:start position:0%
FFL uh system as you've heard uh already
 
05:26:49.230 --> 05:26:49.240 align:start position:0%
provides rigorous oversight and this is
 
05:26:51.948 --> 05:26:51.958 align:start position:0%
uh an unnecessary um set of statutes
 
05:26:54.070 --> 05:26:54.080 align:start position:0%
that are being repealed here uh and I
 
05:26:55.548 --> 05:26:55.558 align:start position:0%
know there was a question that came up
 
05:26:59.230 --> 05:26:59.240 align:start position:0%
earlier having to do with um the the
 
05:27:01.110 --> 05:27:01.120 align:start position:0%
clause in RSA

1597 um and I would just say that for
 
05:27:06.510 --> 05:27:06.520 align:start position:0%
the the committee's reference uh that
 
05:27:09.070 --> 05:27:09.080 align:start position:0%
which will remain does Clearly say that

no person shall sell deliver or
 
05:27:12.830 --> 05:27:12.840 align:start position:0%
otherwise transfer a pistol revolver or
 
05:27:14.830 --> 05:27:14.840 align:start position:0%
any other firearm to a person who has
 
05:27:16.510 --> 05:27:16.520 align:start position:0%
been convicted in any jur in any
 
05:27:19.510 --> 05:27:19.520 align:start position:0%

it's thank you Mr chairman to the
 
06:00:09.390 --> 06:00:09.400 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Sam farington and I
 
06:00:11.948 --> 06:00:11.958 align:start position:0%
represent Rochester Ward 4 I know it's
 
06:00:14.230 --> 06:00:14.240 align:start position:0%
been a long day so I'll try to be brief
 
06:00:16.590 --> 06:00:16.600 align:start position:0%
I'm here today to introduce House Bill
 
06:00:19.030 --> 06:00:19.040 align:start position:0%
609 the purpose of this bill is
 
06:00:21.990 --> 06:00:22.000 align:start position:0%
straightforward to fix certain loopholes
 
06:00:24.628 --> 06:00:24.638 align:start position:0%
in New Hampshire's preemption statute
 
06:00:26.230 --> 06:00:26.240 align:start position:0%
the granite state has a tradition of
 
06:00:28.468 --> 06:00:28.478 align:start position:0%
respecting the right to defend yourself
 
06:00:32.628 --> 06:00:32.638 align:start position:0%
in 2003 the state enacted RSA 159
 
06:00:36.230 --> 06:00:36.240 align:start position:0%
section 26 the preemption statute what
 
06:00:38.230 --> 06:00:38.240 align:start position:0%
this did it prevented political
 
06:00:41.190 --> 06:00:41.200 align:start position:0%
subdivisions so towns cities counties
 
06:00:43.590 --> 06:00:43.600 align:start position:0%
from enacting certain or I guess any
 
06:00:46.430 --> 06:00:46.440 align:start position:0%
regulation restriction on the possession
 
06:00:49.150 --> 06:00:49.160 align:start position:0%
or the sale the use of
 
06:00:52.110 --> 06:00:52.120 align:start position:0%
firearms and so this ensured uniform gun
 
06:00:54.590 --> 06:00:54.600 align:start position:0%
laws throughout the state of New
 
06:00:56.910 --> 06:00:56.920 align:start position:0%
Hampshire in other words your right to
 
06:00:59.110 --> 06:00:59.120 align:start position:0%
defend yourself did not change depending
 
06:01:00.830 --> 06:01:00.840 align:start position:0%
on whether you lived in Rochester or
 
06:01:04.670 --> 06:01:04.680 align:start position:0%
dairy or conquered the only re relevant
 
06:01:07.310 --> 06:01:07.320 align:start position:0%
law was decided by the
 
06:01:09.868 --> 06:01:09.878 align:start position:0%
legislator the preemption statute gives
 
06:01:14.310 --> 06:01:14.320 align:start position:0%
authority to the to the state right now
 
06:01:16.750 --> 06:01:16.760 align:start position:0%
state agencies are exercising that
 
06:01:19.310 --> 06:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
Authority and that's a problem it's a
 
06:01:20.830 --> 06:01:20.840 align:start position:0%
problem because state agencies are
 
06:01:22.990 --> 06:01:23.000 align:start position:0%
telling certain employees that you can't
 
06:01:26.030 --> 06:01:26.040 align:start position:0%
defend yourself while on the job your
 
06:01:28.310 --> 06:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
right to defend yourself should not end
 
06:01:29.948 --> 06:01:29.958 align:start position:0%
when you step foot into a government
 
06:01:31.990 --> 06:01:32.000 align:start position:0%
building or when you go to work for
 
06:01:32.000 --> 06:01:33.070 align:start position:0%
building or when you go to work for
state

06:01:33.070 --> 06:01:33.080 align:start position:0%
state
 
06:01:36.270 --> 06:01:36.280 align:start position:0%
agency this is a problem
 
06:01:39.548 --> 06:01:39.558 align:start position:0%
House Bill 609 addresses this by adding
 
06:01:41.750 --> 06:01:41.760 align:start position:0%
Clarity to the language and removing the
 
06:01:43.708 --> 06:01:43.718 align:start position:0%
vagueness it does this by adding
 
06:01:46.150 --> 06:01:46.160 align:start position:0%
agencies as you can see in the bill to
 
06:01:49.868 --> 06:01:49.878 align:start position:0%
the preemption and also restricting
 
06:01:52.430 --> 06:01:52.440 align:start position:0%
certain rules as well as the ordinances
 
06:01:55.788 --> 06:01:55.798 align:start position:0%
and laws and regulations of the language
 
06:01:57.990 --> 06:01:58.000 align:start position:0%
and with that I thank you for your time
 
06:02:00.230 --> 06:02:00.240 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to ask any or answer
 
06:02:00.240 --> 06:02:02.548 align:start position:0%
and I'd be happy to ask any or answer
any

06:02:02.548 --> 06:02:02.558 align:start position:0%
 
06:02:04.788 --> 06:02:04.798 align:start position:0%
questions thank you we we may have a few
 
06:02:06.750 --> 06:02:06.760 align:start position:0%
questions just give me a second as I go
 
06:02:09.350 --> 06:02:09.360 align:start position:0%
over the the bill what was the impetus
 
06:02:11.350 --> 06:02:11.360 align:start position:0%
for you bringing this bill did you um
 
06:02:12.868 --> 06:02:12.878 align:start position:0%
have a an employee you don't have to
 
06:02:14.390 --> 06:02:14.400 align:start position:0%
give me any names or anything but was it
 
06:02:16.150 --> 06:02:16.160 align:start position:0%
a state agency employee that felt that
 
06:02:17.830 --> 06:02:17.840 align:start position:0%
they were being wronged or yeah there
 
06:02:20.150 --> 06:02:20.160 align:start position:0%
was a a tragic instance that led to a
 
06:02:22.548 --> 06:02:22.558 align:start position:0%
death and uh another representative will
 
06:02:24.270 --> 06:02:24.280 align:start position:0%
speak on that okay
 
06:02:26.110 --> 06:02:26.120 align:start position:0%
great any questions for the
 
06:02:29.150 --> 06:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
representative what is what is the
 
06:02:31.070 --> 06:02:31.080 align:start position:0%
age have
 
06:02:34.190 --> 06:02:34.200 align:start position:0%
question go ahead thank you Mr chairman
 
06:02:35.510 --> 06:02:35.520 align:start position:0%
um I'm hoping you can answer a question
 
06:02:36.830 --> 06:02:36.840 align:start position:0%
for something I've been trying to find
 
06:02:38.190 --> 06:02:38.200 align:start position:0%
for several
 
06:02:40.990 --> 06:02:41.000 align:start position:0%
years and I apologize cuz he and I are
 
06:02:44.310 --> 06:02:44.320 align:start position:0%
sharing the bill right now do you know
 
06:02:47.190 --> 06:02:47.200 align:start position:0%
what what the legal age is in New
 
06:02:50.590 --> 06:02:50.600 align:start position:0%
Hampshire for a person to have um pepper
 
06:02:54.230 --> 06:02:54.240 align:start position:0%
spray and or maybe like a a taser or is
 
06:02:56.548 --> 06:02:56.558 align:start position:0%
there an age yeah I didn't mention that
 
06:02:59.270 --> 06:02:59.280 align:start position:0%
but um this bill would also add
 
06:03:02.110 --> 06:03:02.120 align:start position:0%
self-defense tools so pepper spray taser
 
06:03:04.590 --> 06:03:04.600 align:start position:0%
stun guns other defense tools to the
 
06:03:08.030 --> 06:03:08.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:03:10.230 --> 06:03:10.240 align:start position:0%
I could get back to you on the age
 
06:03:12.948 --> 06:03:12.958 align:start position:0%
requirement um but that would be added
 
06:03:15.270 --> 06:03:15.280 align:start position:0%
to the bill okay so my my I'm sorry
 
06:03:17.310 --> 06:03:17.320 align:start position:0%
follow up Mr chairman so the reason for
 
06:03:18.868 --> 06:03:18.878 align:start position:0%
my for my question if it helps clarify
 
06:03:21.868 --> 06:03:21.878 align:start position:0%
what I'm asking is say a person uh 16
 
06:03:23.708 --> 06:03:23.718 align:start position:0%
years old say they they waitress right
 
06:03:25.990 --> 06:03:26.000 align:start position:0%
it's Saturday night they made a lot of
 
06:03:26.948 --> 06:03:26.958 align:start position:0%
money that night they're walking into
 
06:03:28.548 --> 06:03:28.558 align:start position:0%
their car obviously they don't have a
 
06:03:33.030 --> 06:03:33.040 align:start position:0%
firearm um or even some so if they
 
06:03:34.468 --> 06:03:34.478 align:start position:0%
wanted to have say pepper SP in their
 
06:03:34.478 --> 06:03:36.030 align:start position:0%
wanted to have say pepper SP in their
keychain

06:03:36.030 --> 06:03:36.040 align:start position:0%
keychain
 
06:03:37.390 --> 06:03:37.400 align:start position:0%
I was under the impression that there
 
06:03:38.948 --> 06:03:38.958 align:start position:0%
there was like an age limit for that and
 
06:03:40.708 --> 06:03:40.718 align:start position:0%
I wanted to do away with that but I
 
06:03:42.628 --> 06:03:42.638 align:start position:0%
couldn't find it to see what it was and
 
06:03:45.230 --> 06:03:45.240 align:start position:0%
that's why I'm curious if you you know
 
06:03:47.230 --> 06:03:47.240 align:start position:0%
that my understanding would be that that
 
06:03:49.830 --> 06:03:49.840 align:start position:0%
would be set by the state by the
 
06:03:52.510 --> 06:03:52.520 align:start position:0%
legislator and under the preemption
 
06:03:55.708 --> 06:03:55.718 align:start position:0%
statute cities and towns couldn't pass
 
06:03:59.150 --> 06:03:59.160 align:start position:0%
further regulation on that matter okay
 
06:03:59.160 --> 06:04:01.190 align:start position:0%
further regulation on that matter okay
thank

06:04:01.190 --> 06:04:01.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:04:03.390 --> 06:04:03.400 align:start position:0%
you thank you for your test oh
 
06:04:06.948 --> 06:04:06.958 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:08.548 --> 06:04:08.558 align:start position:0%
thanks for taking my question under
 
06:04:11.430 --> 06:04:11.440 align:start position:0%
under your bill would a school uh be
 
06:04:13.350 --> 06:04:13.360 align:start position:0%
able to prohibit any of these items like
 
06:04:13.360 --> 06:04:14.990 align:start position:0%
able to prohibit any of these items like
stun

06:04:14.990 --> 06:04:15.000 align:start position:0%
stun
 
06:04:18.430 --> 06:04:18.440 align:start position:0%
guns the bill prevents political
 
06:04:22.590 --> 06:04:22.600 align:start position:0%
subdivisions from regulating uh the use
 
06:04:24.708 --> 06:04:24.718 align:start position:0%
the the school
 
06:04:27.030 --> 06:04:27.040 align:start position:0%
board a school district would be a
 
06:04:27.040 --> 06:04:28.910 align:start position:0%
board a school district would be a
political

06:04:28.910 --> 06:04:28.920 align:start position:0%
political
 
06:04:33.190 --> 06:04:33.200 align:start position:0%
subdivision so a school followup so so a
 
06:04:35.350 --> 06:04:35.360 align:start position:0%
school district would not be able to ban
 
06:04:35.360 --> 06:04:37.110 align:start position:0%
school district would not be able to ban
these

06:04:37.110 --> 06:04:37.120 align:start position:0%
these
 
06:04:40.350 --> 06:04:40.360 align:start position:0%
correct okay obviously federal law would
 
06:04:46.070 --> 06:04:46.080 align:start position:0%
 
06:04:49.310 --> 06:04:49.320 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
 
06:04:49.320 --> 06:04:50.708 align:start position:0%
you see no further questions thank you
thank

06:04:50.708 --> 06:04:50.718 align:start position:0%
thank
 
06:05:06.030 --> 06:05:06.040 align:start position:0%
 
06:05:07.670 --> 06:05:07.680 align:start position:0%
afternoon thank you Mr chairman members
 
06:05:08.750 --> 06:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the opportunity to
 
06:05:10.708 --> 06:05:10.718 align:start position:0%
testify in strong support of House Bill
 
06:05:12.868 --> 06:05:12.878 align:start position:0%
609 I'm representative Donald McFarland
 
06:05:14.868 --> 06:05:14.878 align:start position:0%
of orange I'm here representing my
 
06:05:16.430 --> 06:05:16.440 align:start position:0%
constituents in the towns of Alexandria
 
06:05:18.590 --> 06:05:18.600 align:start position:0%
Bridgewater Bristol Kan and dorcha and
 
06:05:20.430 --> 06:05:20.440 align:start position:0%
field graft and gron Hebron and orange
 
06:05:22.548 --> 06:05:22.558 align:start position:0%
my testimony is not made on behalf of
 
06:05:24.270 --> 06:05:24.280 align:start position:0%
any private employer nor should it be
 
06:05:25.990 --> 06:05:26.000 align:start position:0%
construed to represent the views of any
 
06:05:29.190 --> 06:05:29.200 align:start position:0%
of my employers our state constitution
 
06:05:31.030 --> 06:05:31.040 align:start position:0%
grants the general court the power to
 
06:05:33.190 --> 06:05:33.200 align:start position:0%
legislate on matters affecting the
 
06:05:35.628 --> 06:05:35.638 align:start position:0%
rights and safety of our citizens how
 
06:05:37.830 --> 06:05:37.840 align:start position:0%
House Bill 609 reinforces this
 
06:05:40.788 --> 06:05:40.798 align:start position:0%
constitutional mandate by ensuring that
 
06:05:43.390 --> 06:05:43.400 align:start position:0%
the regulation of self-defense tools
 
06:05:45.510 --> 06:05:45.520 align:start position:0%
remains within the purview of our
 
06:05:48.230 --> 06:05:48.240 align:start position:0%
elected representatives this centralized
 
06:05:51.030 --> 06:05:51.040 align:start position:0%
approach promotes consistency and
 
06:05:53.350 --> 06:05:53.360 align:start position:0%
accountability in our laws without House
 
06:05:55.750 --> 06:05:55.760 align:start position:0%
Bill 609 there's a risk of regulatory
 
06:05:57.350 --> 06:05:57.360 align:start position:0%
fragmentation where various state
 
06:05:58.708 --> 06:05:58.718 align:start position:0%
agencies and local and Municipal
 
06:06:01.670 --> 06:06:01.680 align:start position:0%
entities could impose differing rules on
 
06:06:03.590 --> 06:06:03.600 align:start position:0%
the sale possession and use of
 
06:06:06.390 --> 06:06:06.400 align:start position:0%
self-defense tools such a patchwork of
 
06:06:08.750 --> 06:06:08.760 align:start position:0%
regulations would create confusion among
 
06:06:10.430 --> 06:06:10.440 align:start position:0%
citizens and law enforcement potentially
 
06:06:12.868 --> 06:06:12.878 align:start position:0%
leading to unintentional violations and
 
06:06:15.830 --> 06:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
uneven enforcement across the state New
 
06:06:17.670 --> 06:06:17.680 align:start position:0%
Hampshire has a proud tradition of
 
06:06:19.510 --> 06:06:19.520 align:start position:0%
respecting individual
 
06:06:22.788 --> 06:06:22.798 align:start position:0%
liberty and that includes the right to
 
06:06:24.628 --> 06:06:24.638 align:start position:0%
self-defense by retaining that
 
06:06:26.628 --> 06:06:26.638 align:start position:0%
regulatory Authority within the general
 
06:06:28.708 --> 06:06:28.718 align:start position:0%
court this bill ensures that any
 
06:06:30.590 --> 06:06:30.600 align:start position:0%
legislation affecting these rights
 
06:06:32.430 --> 06:06:32.440 align:start position:0%
undergoes thorough debate and
 
06:06:34.590 --> 06:06:34.600 align:start position:0%
consideration by The People's elected
 
06:06:37.150 --> 06:06:37.160 align:start position:0%
representatives this process safeguards
 
06:06:39.830 --> 06:06:39.840 align:start position:0%
against Hasty or unilateral decisions
 
06:06:42.590 --> 06:06:42.600 align:start position:0%
that could impinge and infringe upon
 
06:06:45.110 --> 06:06:45.120 align:start position:0%
constitutional rights in conclusion this
 
06:06:46.510 --> 06:06:46.520 align:start position:0%
is a prudent measure that prevents
 
06:06:48.590 --> 06:06:48.600 align:start position:0%
regulatory inconsistency protects
 
06:06:50.590 --> 06:06:50.600 align:start position:0%
individual rights and enhances Public
 
06:06:52.070 --> 06:06:52.080 align:start position:0%
Safety I urge the committee to support
 
06:06:56.830 --> 06:06:56.840 align:start position:0%
 
06:06:59.070 --> 06:06:59.080 align:start position:0%
time see no questions thank you for your
 
06:06:59.080 --> 06:07:01.350 align:start position:0%
time see no questions thank you for your
test

06:07:01.350 --> 06:07:01.360 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:14.270 --> 06:07:14.280 align:start position:0%
 
06:07:16.230 --> 06:07:16.240 align:start position:0%
good afternoon former representative Jr
 
06:07:18.230 --> 06:07:18.240 align:start position:0%
hle dun Barton speaking on behalf of the
 
06:07:20.628 --> 06:07:20.638 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire Firearms Coalition the
 
06:07:24.030 --> 06:07:24.040 align:start position:0%
bill before you um is a continuation of
 
06:07:26.270 --> 06:07:26.280 align:start position:0%
something that was started 20 years ago
 
06:07:28.548 --> 06:07:28.558 align:start position:0%
20 years ago the state legislature
 
06:07:30.830 --> 06:07:30.840 align:start position:0%
realized that having this Patchwork
 
06:07:33.430 --> 06:07:33.440 align:start position:0%
quilt of laws or rules at different
 
06:07:35.788 --> 06:07:35.798 align:start position:0%
towns would be problematic
 
06:07:37.070 --> 06:07:37.080 align:start position:0%
you don't want to have to go from
 
06:07:39.070 --> 06:07:39.080 align:start position:0%
Amherst to Milford and then find out
 
06:07:40.708 --> 06:07:40.718 align:start position:0%
suddenly you're violating a town
 
06:07:43.390 --> 06:07:43.400 align:start position:0%
ordinance this bill was put in 20 years
 
06:07:45.510 --> 06:07:45.520 align:start position:0%
ago to address that that we will have
 
06:07:49.190 --> 06:07:49.200 align:start position:0%
statewide uniform laws relative to
 
06:07:51.110 --> 06:07:51.120 align:start position:0%
firearms in
 
06:07:55.350 --> 06:07:55.360 align:start position:0%
200 11 that was further expanded to
 
06:07:58.910 --> 06:07:58.920 align:start position:0%
include um knives as part of this policy
 
06:08:01.868 --> 06:08:01.878 align:start position:0%
because we were aware at the time that
 
06:08:04.548 --> 06:08:04.558 align:start position:0%
certain uh retail establishments near
 
06:08:07.628 --> 06:08:07.638 align:start position:0%
the the town of Hampton in particular
 
06:08:10.750 --> 06:08:10.760 align:start position:0%
were were regulating which which knives
 
06:08:13.628 --> 06:08:13.638 align:start position:0%
could be sold and not sold so this
 
06:08:16.310 --> 06:08:16.320 align:start position:0%
passed overwhelmingly and in a in a
 
06:08:18.548 --> 06:08:18.558 align:start position:0%
strongly partisan House and Senate this
 
06:08:21.110 --> 06:08:21.120 align:start position:0%
passed obviously but it was also signed
 
06:08:23.708 --> 06:08:23.718 align:start position:0%
by Governor Lynch realizing that we
 
06:08:26.150 --> 06:08:26.160 align:start position:0%
should have uniform laws relative to
 
06:08:30.150 --> 06:08:30.160 align:start position:0%
Firearms tools firearms and tools um the
 
06:08:32.510 --> 06:08:32.520 align:start position:0%
bill before you expands this to other
 
06:08:36.150 --> 06:08:36.160 align:start position:0%
non-lethal self-defense tools
 
06:08:38.990 --> 06:08:39.000 align:start position:0%
I I have three CH well four children
 
06:08:42.150 --> 06:08:42.160 align:start position:0%
three boys and a girl um my oldest or my
 
06:08:44.310 --> 06:08:44.320 align:start position:0%
daughter is is no longer a minor but
 
06:08:46.830 --> 06:08:46.840 align:start position:0%
when she was a minor as a dad I would
 
06:08:48.590 --> 06:08:48.600 align:start position:0%
let her have pepper spray if she was
 
06:08:50.230 --> 06:08:50.240 align:start position:0%
going out and walking the dog cuz that
 
06:08:51.910 --> 06:08:51.920 align:start position:0%
was a good way for her to protect
 
06:08:54.868 --> 06:08:54.878 align:start position:0%
herself and we live in a pretty quiet
 
06:08:57.310 --> 06:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
Town dun Barton has 40 residents per
 
06:08:59.070 --> 06:08:59.080 align:start position:0%
square mile so it's a pretty quiet Town
 
06:09:01.310 --> 06:09:01.320 align:start position:0%
relative to like
 
06:09:03.030 --> 06:09:03.040 align:start position:0%
Manchester and I thought it was a
 
06:09:04.830 --> 06:09:04.840 align:start position:0%
prudent way for me as a dad to let my
 
06:09:07.948 --> 06:09:07.958 align:start position:0%
daughter take our dog for a walk same
 
06:09:09.948 --> 06:09:09.958 align:start position:0%
thing is true we might want children who
 
06:09:11.910 --> 06:09:11.920 align:start position:0%
are out walking or biking or hiking or
 
06:09:13.590 --> 06:09:13.600 align:start position:0%
any of the normal activities that we do
 
06:09:15.910 --> 06:09:15.920 align:start position:0%
in the state to be able to protect
 
06:09:18.390 --> 06:09:18.400 align:start position:0%
themselves but there's no laws today
 
06:09:20.230 --> 06:09:20.240 align:start position:0%
that make sure that there's uniform
 
06:09:22.830 --> 06:09:22.840 align:start position:0%
regulations across the state relative to
 
06:09:25.070 --> 06:09:25.080 align:start position:0%
these non-lethal forms of
 
06:09:27.868 --> 06:09:27.878 align:start position:0%
self-defense so this bill expands it to
 
06:09:31.190 --> 06:09:31.200 align:start position:0%
non-lethal forms and itemizes a list the
 
06:09:33.750 --> 06:09:33.760 align:start position:0%
bill also closes this loophole about
 
06:09:35.910 --> 06:09:35.920 align:start position:0%
agencies and someone asked the question
 
06:09:38.468 --> 06:09:38.478 align:start position:0%
before what about that we had
 
06:09:40.510 --> 06:09:40.520 align:start position:0%
unfortunately a very tragic accident
 
06:09:43.670 --> 06:09:43.680 align:start position:0%
with officer hos um and that was due to
 
06:09:46.430 --> 06:09:46.440 align:start position:0%
a policy that was established between
 
06:09:49.190 --> 06:09:49.200 align:start position:0%
DHHS and Dartmouth hos Hospital which
 
06:09:51.628 --> 06:09:51.638 align:start position:0%
was running the state psych psychiatric
 
06:09:54.030 --> 06:09:54.040 align:start position:0%
ward we should be careful when we start
 
06:09:56.548 --> 06:09:56.558 align:start position:0%
disarming our citizens it should not be
 
06:09:58.230 --> 06:09:58.240 align:start position:0%
on the application that you have to
 
06:10:00.270 --> 06:10:00.280 align:start position:0%
voluntarily give up your rights as a
 
06:10:03.230 --> 06:10:03.240 align:start position:0%
citizen to be an employee of the state
 
06:10:06.350 --> 06:10:06.360 align:start position:0%
we should fix that now is a good time
 
06:10:09.350 --> 06:10:09.360 align:start position:0%
time this fixes it it makes it clear
 
06:10:11.708 --> 06:10:11.718 align:start position:0%
that the legislature not the state
 
06:10:12.468 --> 06:10:12.478 align:start position:0%
because the state could be
 
06:10:14.868 --> 06:10:14.878 align:start position:0%
misinterpreted to be an agency so it
 
06:10:18.708 --> 06:10:18.718 align:start position:0%
fixes state to General Court particular
 
06:10:20.350 --> 06:10:20.360 align:start position:0%
and it does that to make it clear that
 
06:10:22.270 --> 06:10:22.280 align:start position:0%
we should be doing any regulations
 
06:10:24.868 --> 06:10:24.878 align:start position:0%
regarding self-defense tools by Statute
 
06:10:28.150 --> 06:10:28.160 align:start position:0%
not by agency rule or by
 
06:10:30.708 --> 06:10:30.718 align:start position:0%
contract and then it goes through and
 
06:10:33.708 --> 06:10:33.718 align:start position:0%
adds these non-defense sorry these
 
06:10:36.270 --> 06:10:36.280 align:start position:0%
non-lethal um tool tools that people
 
06:10:38.628 --> 06:10:38.638 align:start position:0%
routinely use to protect themselves to
 
06:10:40.750 --> 06:10:40.760 align:start position:0%
this list of self-defense tools and
 
06:10:42.948 --> 06:10:42.958 align:start position:0%
that's what it does I would ask that you
 
06:10:45.150 --> 06:10:45.160 align:start position:0%
would find this ought to pass um and I'm
 
06:10:46.628 --> 06:10:46.638 align:start position:0%
here to answer any questions if there's
 
06:10:47.868 --> 06:10:47.878 align:start position:0%
technical questions on either the
 
06:10:49.948 --> 06:10:49.958 align:start position:0%
history of the bill or what the bill
 
06:10:53.548 --> 06:10:53.558 align:start position:0%
does thank you um I have a question so
 
06:10:53.558 --> 06:10:55.750 align:start position:0%
does thank you um I have a question so
agencies

06:10:55.750 --> 06:10:55.760 align:start position:0%
agencies
 
06:10:58.510 --> 06:10:58.520 align:start position:0%
yes you're not allowed to have u a
 
06:11:01.190 --> 06:11:01.200 align:start position:0%
firearm within the Prison
 
06:11:04.830 --> 06:11:04.840 align:start position:0%
Walls it'll if the if the commissioner
 
06:11:09.030 --> 06:11:09.040 align:start position:0%
says okay um all my prison guards you
 
06:11:10.868 --> 06:11:10.878 align:start position:0%
are not allowed to have firearms inside
 
06:11:13.390 --> 06:11:13.400 align:start position:0%
the walls that rule would then be null
 
06:11:15.030 --> 06:11:15.040 align:start position:0%
and void by this statute is that not
 
06:11:18.030 --> 06:11:18.040 align:start position:0%
correct I as written correct and I do
 
06:11:20.868 --> 06:11:20.878 align:start position:0%
believe prisons are one area right the
 
06:11:23.708 --> 06:11:23.718 align:start position:0%
the the inside domain of the psychiatric
 
06:11:26.070 --> 06:11:26.080 align:start position:0%
ward is is areas we might want to
 
06:11:29.510 --> 06:11:29.520 align:start position:0%
include in this statute that says right
 
06:11:31.750 --> 06:11:31.760 align:start position:0%
there are regulations in this narrow
 
06:11:35.030 --> 06:11:35.040 align:start position:0%
area relative to carry okay courts as
 
06:11:36.708 --> 06:11:36.718 align:start position:0%
well courts is already covered under
 
06:11:39.390 --> 06:11:39.400 align:start position:0%
statute that's under 159 I don't know 18
 
06:11:41.350 --> 06:11:41.360 align:start position:0%
192 somewhere in that domain I I don't
 
06:11:42.868 --> 06:11:42.878 align:start position:0%
have it in front of me but would so we
 
06:11:44.628 --> 06:11:44.638 align:start position:0%
have two conflicting statutes though it
 
06:11:47.510 --> 06:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
would say that no state agency well the
 
06:11:50.548 --> 06:11:50.558 align:start position:0%
the Judiciary is its own Branch so yeah
 
06:11:53.750 --> 06:11:53.760 align:start position:0%
but so it it and and I'm going to quote
 
06:11:55.590 --> 06:11:55.600 align:start position:0%
I didn't bring the copy of the bill up
 
06:11:55.600 --> 06:11:57.788 align:start position:0%
I didn't bring the copy of the bill up
right

06:11:57.788 --> 06:11:57.798 align:start position:0%
right
 
06:11:57.798 --> 06:12:00.628 align:start position:0%
right
um

06:12:00.628 --> 06:12:00.638 align:start position:0%
um
 
06:12:04.590 --> 06:12:04.600 align:start position:0%
uh except as right um except as
 
06:12:07.030 --> 06:12:07.040 align:start position:0%
otherwise spe specifically provided by
 
06:12:09.468 --> 06:12:09.478 align:start position:0%
State Statute so in the case of Courts
 
06:12:10.910 --> 06:12:10.920 align:start position:0%
it's already a state statute says you
 
06:12:13.030 --> 06:12:13.040 align:start position:0%
can't do this right yeah or or you're
 
06:12:15.310 --> 06:12:15.320 align:start position:0%
not allowed to carry there I think the
 
06:12:17.910 --> 06:12:17.920 align:start position:0%
point is that if you wanted to do
 
06:12:19.670 --> 06:12:19.680 align:start position:0%
something relative to prisons I would
 
06:12:21.270 --> 06:12:21.280 align:start position:0%
ask that you would delay action on this
 
06:12:23.310 --> 06:12:23.320 align:start position:0%
bill today and I can help you craft an
 
06:12:26.628 --> 06:12:26.638 align:start position:0%
amendment for that one um because I do
 
06:12:28.750 --> 06:12:28.760 align:start position:0%
believe you have an argument to be made
 
06:12:31.708 --> 06:12:31.718 align:start position:0%
about who can carry behind the locked
 
06:12:34.070 --> 06:12:34.080 align:start position:0%
doors within the prison yeah right I do
 
06:12:35.910 --> 06:12:35.920 align:start position:0%
believe the personnel that work at the
 
06:12:37.910 --> 06:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
state prison probably already do carry
 
06:12:39.548 --> 06:12:39.558 align:start position:0%
but I don't know all the rules about the
 
06:12:43.510 --> 06:12:43.520 align:start position:0%
state prison and it's not for us to to
 
06:12:46.150 --> 06:12:46.160 align:start position:0%
to um tell them how to do their job in
 
06:12:47.868 --> 06:12:47.878 align:start position:0%
that area I believe that once they go
 
06:12:49.548 --> 06:12:49.558 align:start position:0%
beyond the locked area and they're in
 
06:12:50.990 --> 06:12:51.000 align:start position:0%
the general population area they don't
 
06:12:54.030 --> 06:12:54.040 align:start position:0%
carry firearms either okay um yeah I
 
06:12:56.190 --> 06:12:56.200 align:start position:0%
think that I think that it would do uh
 
06:12:59.070 --> 06:12:59.080 align:start position:0%
well to think and and we could expand I
 
06:13:01.948 --> 06:13:01.958 align:start position:0%
think it's section
 
06:13:04.910 --> 06:13:04.920 align:start position:0%
15919 I'm going for memory um that is
 
06:13:07.670 --> 06:13:07.680 align:start position:0%
the the prohibition relative to
 
06:13:10.350 --> 06:13:10.360 align:start position:0%
courts if if well the court I know is in
 
06:13:11.788 --> 06:13:11.798 align:start position:0%
statute so if this says other the
 
06:13:13.750 --> 06:13:13.760 align:start position:0%
statutes then it should be fine we don't
 
06:13:15.070 --> 06:13:15.080 align:start position:0%
have to address it right no but I'm just
 
06:13:17.270 --> 06:13:17.280 align:start position:0%
saying you could expand that section if
 
06:13:18.628 --> 06:13:18.638 align:start position:0%
you wanted to do something about the
 
06:13:21.750 --> 06:13:21.760 align:start position:0%
prisons yeah uh Courthouse Securities
 
06:13:24.110 --> 06:13:24.120 align:start position:0%
15919 so you could broaden
 
06:13:28.830 --> 06:13:28.840 align:start position:0%
15919 to write state agencies and state
 
06:13:32.070 --> 06:13:32.080 align:start position:0%
facilities in one section okay further
 
06:13:36.070 --> 06:13:36.080 align:start position:0%
questions representative um Sher
 
06:13:39.590 --> 06:13:39.600 align:start position:0%
uh where I I know uh Bradley House was
 
06:13:45.708 --> 06:13:45.718 align:start position:0%
shot at the uh at the uh at sorry at the
 
06:13:48.390 --> 06:13:48.400 align:start position:0%
uh the the state hospital correct where
 
06:13:50.230 --> 06:13:50.240 align:start position:0%
was he located was he within a lock
 
06:13:52.110 --> 06:13:52.120 align:start position:0%
facility or in the outside no no he was
 
06:13:53.468 --> 06:13:53.478 align:start position:0%
the security for the building at the
 
06:13:55.910 --> 06:13:55.920 align:start position:0%
metal detector he was at the front door
 
06:13:57.670 --> 06:13:57.680 align:start position:0%
okay making sure people didn't make it
 
06:14:00.030 --> 06:14:00.040 align:start position:0%
into the facility with anything that was
 
06:14:02.788 --> 06:14:02.798 align:start position:0%
metallic in nature and he was prohibited
 
06:14:05.190 --> 06:14:05.200 align:start position:0%
by a contract from protecting himself
 
06:14:06.830 --> 06:14:06.840 align:start position:0%
what I wanted to know thank
 
06:14:10.030 --> 06:14:10.040 align:start position:0%
you yeah representative
 
06:14:13.430 --> 06:14:13.440 align:start position:0%
bogert thank you Mr chairman and uh
 
06:14:15.590 --> 06:14:15.600 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question would
 
06:14:18.830 --> 06:14:18.840 align:start position:0%
this have an adverse effect on local
 
06:14:21.948 --> 06:14:21.958 align:start position:0%
jails C in the local jails they don't
 
06:14:27.070 --> 06:14:27.080 align:start position:0%
permit guns within uh the lockdown areas
 
06:14:31.190 --> 06:14:31.200 align:start position:0%
also so the same as prison so I I don't
 
06:14:34.390 --> 06:14:34.400 align:start position:0%
so I don't outside of cities I'm not
 
06:14:37.270 --> 06:14:37.280 align:start position:0%
sure what towns actually have jails I
 
06:14:39.150 --> 06:14:39.160 align:start position:0%
think it means counties count okay
 
06:14:42.868 --> 06:14:42.878 align:start position:0%
counties and as I said if if you choose
 
06:14:45.350 --> 06:14:45.360 align:start position:0%
not to act on this bill today I think we
 
06:14:48.150 --> 06:14:48.160 align:start position:0%
can probably put something under what is
 
06:14:50.510 --> 06:14:50.520 align:start position:0%
15919 relabel it from Courthouse
 
06:14:52.868 --> 06:14:52.878 align:start position:0%
security or broader and we can put in a
 
06:14:57.468 --> 06:14:57.478 align:start position:0%
section six that addresses prisons and
 
06:14:59.548 --> 06:14:59.558 align:start position:0%
jails uh represent that is not the
 
06:15:00.948 --> 06:15:00.958 align:start position:0%
intent for the record that is not the
 
06:15:02.948 --> 06:15:02.958 align:start position:0%
intent of the bill to take care right
 
06:15:05.830 --> 06:15:05.840 align:start position:0%
right uh represent n thank you Mr shair
 
06:15:08.830 --> 06:15:08.840 align:start position:0%
and thanks for taking my question um I I
 
06:15:11.510 --> 06:15:11.520 align:start position:0%
think I I might have misheard you but um
 
06:15:13.830 --> 06:15:13.840 align:start position:0%
in this bill it has the language of or
 
06:15:16.788 --> 06:15:16.798 align:start position:0%
other self-defense tools and I think I I
 
06:15:18.150 --> 06:15:18.160 align:start position:0%
heard you say something that it was
 
06:15:19.750 --> 06:15:19.760 align:start position:0%
itemized could you just direct me to
 
06:15:21.788 --> 06:15:21.798 align:start position:0%
where it's itemized what that actual
 
06:15:23.628 --> 06:15:23.638 align:start position:0%
definition of of other self-defense
 
06:15:26.390 --> 06:15:26.400 align:start position:0%
tools would be so when you write a this
 
06:15:28.150 --> 06:15:28.160 align:start position:0%
has to do with statutory construction
 
06:15:30.070 --> 06:15:30.080 align:start position:0%
when you write an itemized list if you
 
06:15:33.628 --> 06:15:33.638 align:start position:0%
don't put an or other type thing that is
 
06:15:36.990 --> 06:15:37.000 align:start position:0%
 
06:15:39.150 --> 06:15:39.160 align:start position:0%
my question is someone comes up with
 
06:15:40.708 --> 06:15:40.718 align:start position:0%
something newer than a pepper spray
 
06:15:43.670 --> 06:15:43.680 align:start position:0%
device right it's a Kimber makes this
 
06:15:46.590 --> 06:15:46.600 align:start position:0%
pepper spray spray looking pistol okay
 
06:15:48.708 --> 06:15:48.718 align:start position:0%
it's a pistol it has two shots of pepper
 
06:15:51.510 --> 06:15:51.520 align:start position:0%
spray this little red cute thing works
 
06:15:53.310 --> 06:15:53.320 align:start position:0%
really well I guess I've been told
 
06:15:56.390 --> 06:15:56.400 align:start position:0%
anyway is that a pepper spray device or
 
06:15:57.788 --> 06:15:57.798 align:start position:0%
what is that right what if it falls
 
06:16:00.708 --> 06:16:00.718 align:start position:0%
outside of this category so when you
 
06:16:02.910 --> 06:16:02.920 align:start position:0%
make an itemized list that is the list
 
06:16:04.270 --> 06:16:04.280 align:start position:0%
that's what the legislature said they
 
06:16:06.910 --> 06:16:06.920 align:start position:0%
said a B C or D and that means EFG are
 
06:16:09.270 --> 06:16:09.280 align:start position:0%
not included so you tend to put a clause
 
06:16:12.910 --> 06:16:12.920 align:start position:0%
or similar so that it shows the
 
06:16:15.830 --> 06:16:15.840 align:start position:0%
intent okay we could and one way to
 
06:16:17.830 --> 06:16:17.840 align:start position:0%
construct this and we did talk about it
 
06:16:20.468 --> 06:16:20.478 align:start position:0%
was to construct a term at the beginning
 
06:16:24.070 --> 06:16:24.080 align:start position:0%
of one 5926 which is definitions and
 
06:16:25.948 --> 06:16:25.958 align:start position:0%
then you can define an itemized list and
 
06:16:27.708 --> 06:16:27.718 align:start position:0%
just call them self-defense tools
 
06:16:27.718 --> 06:16:29.868 align:start position:0%
just call them self-defense tools
thereafter

06:16:29.868 --> 06:16:29.878 align:start position:0%
thereafter
 
06:16:32.430 --> 06:16:32.440 align:start position:0%
thanks with regard to this um other
 
06:16:35.230 --> 06:16:35.240 align:start position:0%
self-defense tools so let's say I work
 
06:16:38.110 --> 06:16:38.120 align:start position:0%
at the DMV I like to carry a sidearm
 
06:16:39.670 --> 06:16:39.680 align:start position:0%
they say you can't now I can because of
 
06:16:41.350 --> 06:16:41.360 align:start position:0%
this saw but it also say other
 
06:16:42.990 --> 06:16:43.000 align:start position:0%
self-defense tools well if I like to
 
06:16:44.910 --> 06:16:44.920 align:start position:0%
carry a baseball
 
06:16:48.590 --> 06:16:48.600 align:start position:0%
bat can my boss say
 
06:16:51.670 --> 06:16:51.680 align:start position:0%
no well is it a when does a baseball bat
 
06:16:53.990 --> 06:16:54.000 align:start position:0%
become a self-defense tool right that's
 
06:16:57.750 --> 06:16:57.760 align:start position:0%
why it was it was broadly right
 
06:17:02.110 --> 06:17:02.120 align:start position:0%
because we it says and we added right
 
06:17:03.990 --> 06:17:04.000 align:start position:0%
trying to find unintentional C no no no
 
06:17:08.910 --> 06:17:08.920 align:start position:0%
we added knives years ago right um in
 
06:17:12.110 --> 06:17:12.120 align:start position:0%
there is a knife a switchblade is a
 
06:17:14.070 --> 06:17:14.080 align:start position:0%
knife an auto opening whatever the
 
06:17:15.868 --> 06:17:15.878 align:start position:0%
latest and greatest everyday carry knife
 
06:17:17.910 --> 06:17:17.920 align:start position:0%
is right or or they all under the broad
 
06:17:19.350 --> 06:17:19.360 align:start position:0%
category of
 
06:17:22.670 --> 06:17:22.680 align:start position:0%
knives clearly a knife would be a
 
06:17:24.430 --> 06:17:24.440 align:start position:0%
self-defense tool what if it's an auto
 
06:17:25.830 --> 06:17:25.840 align:start position:0%
forward I think it's auto forward
 
06:17:28.310 --> 06:17:28.320 align:start position:0%
opening is the latest craze in the knife
 
06:17:32.270 --> 06:17:32.280 align:start position:0%
Community um does that fall under a
 
06:17:35.030 --> 06:17:35.040 align:start position:0%
special category of knives I mean even
 
06:17:38.590 --> 06:17:38.600 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts got spanked by the Supreme
 
06:17:41.750 --> 06:17:41.760 align:start position:0%
Court in a 90 decision about things like
 
06:17:44.590 --> 06:17:44.600 align:start position:0%
I believe it was pepper spray and tasers
 
06:17:47.830 --> 06:17:47.840 align:start position:0%
in a case about a dozen years ago or so
 
06:17:50.030 --> 06:17:50.040 align:start position:0%
because they were overly restrictive in
 
06:17:52.230 --> 06:17:52.240 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts and the Supreme Court in a
 
06:17:54.070 --> 06:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
90 decision told them no you can't do
 
06:17:55.830 --> 06:17:55.840 align:start position:0%
this these are these are clearly ways to
 
06:17:58.830 --> 06:17:58.840 align:start position:0%
defend yourself I I we left that
 
06:18:01.788 --> 06:18:01.798 align:start position:0%
language or other in there because you
 
06:18:03.590 --> 06:18:03.600 align:start position:0%
don't want you don't want someone to
 
06:18:05.948 --> 06:18:05.958 align:start position:0%
come along I I would call a baseball bat
 
06:18:07.788 --> 06:18:07.798 align:start position:0%
that's more of a tool to go play Little
 
06:18:09.670 --> 06:18:09.680 align:start position:0%
League not than it is a self-defense
 
06:18:12.270 --> 06:18:12.280 align:start position:0%
tool I I understand um what I'm
 
06:18:14.110 --> 06:18:14.120 align:start position:0%
concerned is obstinate employees telling
 
06:18:15.548 --> 06:18:15.558 align:start position:0%
their boss well today this is my
 
06:18:17.230 --> 06:18:17.240 align:start position:0%
self-defense tool what can you do about
 
06:18:17.240 --> 06:18:18.990 align:start position:0%
self-defense tool what can you do about
it

06:18:18.990 --> 06:18:19.000 align:start position:0%
it
 
06:18:21.190 --> 06:18:21.200 align:start position:0%
um all right we'll think about that one
 
06:18:23.190 --> 06:18:23.200 align:start position:0%
we have we have some days any further
 
06:18:26.750 --> 06:18:26.760 align:start position:0%
questions seeing none thank you for your
 
06:18:28.788 --> 06:18:28.798 align:start position:0%
time the chair calls representative
 
06:18:28.798 --> 06:18:40.670 align:start position:0%
time the chair calls representative
Layon

06:18:40.670 --> 06:18:40.680 align:start position:0%
 
06:18:42.510 --> 06:18:42.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman and members of the
 
06:18:44.868 --> 06:18:44.878 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Erica Leon I
 
06:18:46.230 --> 06:18:46.240 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Derry which is
 
06:18:46.240 --> 06:18:47.548 align:start position:0%
represent the town of Derry which is
Rockingham

06:18:47.548 --> 06:18:47.558 align:start position:0%
Rockingham
 
06:18:51.070 --> 06:18:51.080 align:start position:0%
13 I'm in my third term now and when I
 
06:18:52.590 --> 06:18:52.600 align:start position:0%
first came in I thought everything was
 
06:18:54.230 --> 06:18:54.240 align:start position:0%
really straightforward talking about the
 
06:18:56.948 --> 06:18:56.958 align:start position:0%
state and political subdivisions then on
 
06:19:00.468 --> 06:19:00.478 align:start position:0%
my second term I was um added to jel car
 
06:19:02.628 --> 06:19:02.638 align:start position:0%
The Joint legislative administ joint
 
06:19:04.310 --> 06:19:04.320 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
 
06:19:04.320 --> 06:19:05.390 align:start position:0%
legislative committee on administrative
rules

06:19:05.390 --> 06:19:05.400 align:start position:0%
rules
 
06:19:07.750 --> 06:19:07.760 align:start position:0%
and I have to tell you the onion of
 
06:19:09.670 --> 06:19:09.680 align:start position:0%
different layers of government really
 
06:19:12.230 --> 06:19:12.240 align:start position:0%
opened up to me because I didn't really
 
06:19:15.150 --> 06:19:15.160 align:start position:0%
understand just how much agencies are
 
06:19:17.350 --> 06:19:17.360 align:start position:0%
involved in the state just how many
 
06:19:19.628 --> 06:19:19.638 align:start position:0%
people work for those agencies and how
 
06:19:22.430 --> 06:19:22.440 align:start position:0%
often they can set policy for the people
 
06:19:24.190 --> 06:19:24.200 align:start position:0%
who work within those agencies
 
06:19:26.708 --> 06:19:26.718 align:start position:0%
themselves without any legislative
 
06:19:29.670 --> 06:19:29.680 align:start position:0%
oversight um it I believe that when this
 
06:19:32.430 --> 06:19:32.440 align:start position:0%
bill was first passed the intention was
 
06:19:34.310 --> 06:19:34.320 align:start position:0%
that agencies are considered part of the
 
06:19:36.070 --> 06:19:36.080 align:start position:0%
state but if you haven't had that
 
06:19:37.628 --> 06:19:37.638 align:start position:0%
experience about sort of seeing those
 
06:19:39.230 --> 06:19:39.240 align:start position:0%
differences and those definitions it's
 
06:19:40.468 --> 06:19:40.478 align:start position:0%
kind of hard to capture it when you're
 
06:19:42.230 --> 06:19:42.240 align:start position:0%
doing a Big Bill like this in order to
 
06:19:44.310 --> 06:19:44.320 align:start position:0%
make sure that you are getting rid of
 
06:19:45.628 --> 06:19:45.638 align:start position:0%
the patchwork of
 
06:19:47.948 --> 06:19:47.958 align:start position:0%
rules so I want to zoom back from that
 
06:19:50.030 --> 06:19:50.040 align:start position:0%
and talk about one of my neighbors um I
 
06:19:51.430 --> 06:19:51.440 align:start position:0%
had some neighbors down the street from
 
06:19:55.030 --> 06:19:55.040 align:start position:0%
me um really didn't like the Second
 
06:19:56.548 --> 06:19:56.558 align:start position:0%
Amendment really didn't like
 
06:19:58.350 --> 06:19:58.360 align:start position:0%
self-defense really didn't like any of
 
06:20:00.670 --> 06:20:00.680 align:start position:0%
that and we talked a lot they knew that
 
06:20:02.150 --> 06:20:02.160 align:start position:0%
around then was when I had gotten my
 
06:20:04.310 --> 06:20:04.320 align:start position:0%
first gun and we started talking and
 
06:20:06.110 --> 06:20:06.120 align:start position:0%
they was working a job at one of the
 
06:20:08.350 --> 06:20:08.360 align:start position:0%
state agencies where she ended up having
 
06:20:10.910 --> 06:20:10.920 align:start position:0%
to go alone into situations where she
 
06:20:10.920 --> 06:20:11.830 align:start position:0%
to go alone into situations where she
felt

06:20:11.830 --> 06:20:11.840 align:start position:0%
felt
 
06:20:14.150 --> 06:20:14.160 align:start position:0%
uncomfortable it didn't take long from
 
06:20:16.150 --> 06:20:16.160 align:start position:0%
them for them to start realizing the
 
06:20:18.390 --> 06:20:18.400 align:start position:0%
value of self-defense and start
 
06:20:20.670 --> 06:20:20.680 align:start position:0%
realizing the value of tools that would
 
06:20:22.868 --> 06:20:22.878 align:start position:0%
allow that young woman the chance to get
 
06:20:25.310 --> 06:20:25.320 align:start position:0%
away from a bad situation she didn't
 
06:20:27.110 --> 06:20:27.120 align:start position:0%
have that opportunity at her job with
 
06:20:29.468 --> 06:20:29.478 align:start position:0%
the agency and so she quit the job
 
06:20:30.708 --> 06:20:30.718 align:start position:0%
because she was worried that if she
 
06:20:33.030 --> 06:20:33.040 align:start position:0%
continued doing that job she'd end up in
 
06:20:35.750 --> 06:20:35.760 align:start position:0%
a situation where she was killed or
 
06:20:38.230 --> 06:20:38.240 align:start position:0%
worse so I think it's critical to make
 
06:20:40.350 --> 06:20:40.360 align:start position:0%
sure that we can protect people that
 
06:20:42.150 --> 06:20:42.160 align:start position:0%
work throughout the state work for our
 
06:20:44.310 --> 06:20:44.320 align:start position:0%
agencies and make sure that we're not
 
06:20:47.070 --> 06:20:47.080 align:start position:0%
denying them the tools that they need um
 
06:20:49.070 --> 06:20:49.080 align:start position:0%
if their brain and all other other ways
 
06:20:51.430 --> 06:20:51.440 align:start position:0%
to protect themselves fail because quite
 
06:20:53.350 --> 06:20:53.360 align:start position:0%
honestly sometimes we run up against
 
06:20:56.110 --> 06:20:56.120 align:start position:0%
very bad people and when very bad people
 
06:20:58.708 --> 06:20:58.718 align:start position:0%
want to do something to you it's good to
 
06:21:01.070 --> 06:21:01.080 align:start position:0%
have a tool to stop them might be pepper
 
06:21:02.510 --> 06:21:02.520 align:start position:0%
spray that might be your level of
 
06:21:04.868 --> 06:21:04.878 align:start position:0%
comfort it might be some new electron I
 
06:21:06.830 --> 06:21:06.840 align:start position:0%
defense weapon that isn't a taser but
 
06:21:08.270 --> 06:21:08.280 align:start position:0%
works in a different way which is why
 
06:21:09.750 --> 06:21:09.760 align:start position:0%
it's nice to have the language about
 
06:21:12.070 --> 06:21:12.080 align:start position:0%
other self-defense tools or it might be
 
06:21:13.390 --> 06:21:13.400 align:start position:0%
a firearm if that's something that
 
06:21:15.030 --> 06:21:15.040 align:start position:0%
you're comfortable with and you
 
06:21:17.190 --> 06:21:17.200 align:start position:0%
understand the consequences of using
 
06:21:19.350 --> 06:21:19.360 align:start position:0%
that I think that it's very very
 
06:21:22.350 --> 06:21:22.360 align:start position:0%
important that our plow drivers aren't
 
06:21:24.830 --> 06:21:24.840 align:start position:0%
left to be defenseless if they end up in
 
06:21:26.590 --> 06:21:26.600 align:start position:0%
a situation where like that
 
06:21:29.150 --> 06:21:29.160 align:start position:0%
Massachusetts plow truck driver about a
 
06:21:30.990 --> 06:21:31.000 align:start position:0%
20 years ago decided to plow in
 
06:21:34.030 --> 06:21:34.040 align:start position:0%
somebody's car and there was a really
 
06:21:34.040 --> 06:21:35.070 align:start position:0%
somebody's car and there was a really
big

06:21:35.070 --> 06:21:35.080 align:start position:0%
big
 
06:21:37.670 --> 06:21:37.680 align:start position:0%
confrontation because right now without
 
06:21:39.190 --> 06:21:39.200 align:start position:0%
this somebody who's working for the
 
06:21:41.510 --> 06:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
Department of Transportation can be told
 
06:21:43.030 --> 06:21:43.040 align:start position:0%
that they can't carry a
 
06:21:45.670 --> 06:21:45.680 align:start position:0%
firearm and they might be left in a very
 
06:21:48.390 --> 06:21:48.400 align:start position:0%
very vulnerable situation I think that
 
06:21:50.788 --> 06:21:50.798 align:start position:0%
this is a really Common Sense expansion
 
06:21:53.110 --> 06:21:53.120 align:start position:0%
of um of a law that just protects the
 
06:21:55.468 --> 06:21:55.478 align:start position:0%
people of New Hampshire allows them the
 
06:21:57.830 --> 06:21:57.840 align:start position:0%
same opportunity to protects as every
 
06:22:00.468 --> 06:22:00.478 align:start position:0%
other Granite Stater and whether or not
 
06:22:02.990 --> 06:22:03.000 align:start position:0%
you personally want to use any of these
 
06:22:05.510 --> 06:22:05.520 align:start position:0%
tools I I find it uncom conscious B that
 
06:22:07.110 --> 06:22:07.120 align:start position:0%
we would say that somebody's going to go
 
06:22:09.548 --> 06:22:09.558 align:start position:0%
out work for the state work for an
 
06:22:11.628 --> 06:22:11.638 align:start position:0%
agency and they aren't allowed to
 
06:22:13.910 --> 06:22:13.920 align:start position:0%
protect themsel with effective tools so
 
06:22:15.590 --> 06:22:15.600 align:start position:0%
I support this bill and I hope that you
 
06:22:17.788 --> 06:22:17.798 align:start position:0%
will support it as well I would be very
 
06:22:20.030 --> 06:22:20.040 align:start position:0%
supportive of an amendment to outline in
 
06:22:22.830 --> 06:22:22.840 align:start position:0%
statute things like the prison system um
 
06:22:24.990 --> 06:22:25.000 align:start position:0%
where we know that we should not be
 
06:22:27.070 --> 06:22:27.080 align:start position:0%
having people walking in with Firearms
 
06:22:29.468 --> 06:22:29.478 align:start position:0%
let's make sure that beyond that beyond
 
06:22:32.468 --> 06:22:32.478 align:start position:0%
that metal detector nobody's Waltzing in
 
06:22:33.910 --> 06:22:33.920 align:start position:0%
and they're able to make rules about
 
06:22:36.390 --> 06:22:36.400 align:start position:0%
which which employees are there
 
06:22:38.708 --> 06:22:38.718 align:start position:0%
but I have to say that when I heard the
 
06:22:41.750 --> 06:22:41.760 align:start position:0%
news about what happened to officer hos
 
06:22:44.070 --> 06:22:44.080 align:start position:0%
my first thought was my God I hope that
 
06:22:46.788 --> 06:22:46.798 align:start position:0%
we didn't prevent him from protecting
 
06:22:49.190 --> 06:22:49.200 align:start position:0%
himself unfortunately we did we don't
 
06:22:50.350 --> 06:22:50.360 align:start position:0%
know if he would have made the choice to
 
06:22:51.868 --> 06:22:51.878 align:start position:0%
carry or not we don't know if he would
 
06:22:54.670 --> 06:22:54.680 align:start position:0%
have had the time to do anything but he
 
06:22:56.628 --> 06:22:56.638 align:start position:0%
was disarmed because of the actions of
 
06:22:58.590 --> 06:22:58.600 align:start position:0%
the state and we have a chance to fix
 
06:22:58.600 --> 06:22:59.510 align:start position:0%
the state and we have a chance to fix
that

06:22:59.510 --> 06:22:59.520 align:start position:0%
that
 
06:23:02.310 --> 06:23:02.320 align:start position:0%
now for the for the record he he
 
06:23:03.628 --> 06:23:03.638 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have had time there was a State
 
06:23:06.150 --> 06:23:06.160 align:start position:0%
Trooper standing right there so it was
 
06:23:07.750 --> 06:23:07.760 align:start position:0%
it was tragic but it did call to
 
06:23:10.030 --> 06:23:10.040 align:start position:0%
attention the fact that they were um
 
06:23:12.030 --> 06:23:12.040 align:start position:0%
forcing them to be defenseless so thank
 
06:23:14.708 --> 06:23:14.718 align:start position:0%
you um any further questions for the
 
06:23:16.830 --> 06:23:16.840 align:start position:0%

06:23:44.190 --> 06:23:44.200 align:start position:0%
that points just been made so thank you
 
06:23:46.030 --> 06:23:46.040 align:start position:0%

thank you thank you and by that you

New Hampshire but in different states
 
06:24:05.590 --> 06:24:05.600 align:start position:0%
where she's gone out and uh got in a
 
06:24:07.948 --> 06:24:07.958 align:start position:0%
situation once with a bear and once with
 
06:24:11.270 --> 06:24:11.280 align:start position:0%
a pack of coyotes and she said time to
 
06:24:14.468 --> 06:24:14.478 align:start position:0%

Firearms by legally protecting tools
 
06:25:05.910 --> 06:25:05.920 align:start position:0%
such as stun guns tasers and pepper
 
06:25:09.190 --> 06:25:09.200 align:start position:0%
spray we ensure all residents can defend
 
06:25:11.750 --> 06:25:11.760 align:start position:0%

06:25:38.948 --> 06:25:38.958 align:start position:0%
evening uh thanks for listening to me
 
06:25:40.310 --> 06:25:40.320 align:start position:0%
today again for the I don't know how
 
06:25:42.310 --> 06:25:42.320 align:start position:0%
many it's time but um joean and gunar is
 
06:25:44.990 --> 06:25:45.000 align:start position:0%
of New Hampshire uh we support this bill
 
06:25:47.310 --> 06:25:47.320 align:start position:0%
I I agree with some of the concerns
 
06:25:49.310 --> 06:25:49.320 align:start position:0%
earlier we should just fix those little
 
06:25:51.910 --> 06:25:51.920 align:start position:0%
little changes but uh just remember this
 
06:25:54.510 --> 06:25:54.520 align:start position:0%
isn't legalizing you know the use of
 
06:25:55.990 --> 06:25:56.000 align:start position:0%
free reain you can do whatever you want
 
06:25:57.708 --> 06:25:57.718 align:start position:0%
with stun guns Peppers we have laws on
 
06:25:59.788 --> 06:25:59.798 align:start position:0%
the books if you use a pepper spray or
 
06:26:02.830 --> 06:26:02.840 align:start position:0%
if you T if you use a a spray on someone
 
06:26:04.628 --> 06:26:04.638 align:start position:0%
it's a misdemeanor if it's used Comm in
 
06:26:05.708 --> 06:26:05.718 align:start position:0%
the commission of a crime it's
 
06:26:07.670 --> 06:26:07.680 align:start position:0%
considered a felony if you use it on a
 
06:26:09.948 --> 06:26:09.958 align:start position:0%
police officer it's considered a felony
 
06:26:11.230 --> 06:26:11.240 align:start position:0%
uh with stun guns but apparently it's
 
06:26:12.548 --> 06:26:12.558 align:start position:0%
only a misdemeanor if your pepper spray
 
06:26:15.350 --> 06:26:15.360 align:start position:0%
them minut it's not in a crime but I'll
 
06:26:17.868 --> 06:26:17.878 align:start position:0%
let I'll let that alone
 
06:26:20.788 --> 06:26:20.798 align:start position:0%
um also uh the uh the concern about
 
06:26:23.430 --> 06:26:23.440 align:start position:0%
other devices um we' we heard Bill we
 
06:26:24.990 --> 06:26:25.000 align:start position:0%
heard Bill earlier about uh you know
 
06:26:26.670 --> 06:26:26.680 align:start position:0%
paper weights I'm sorry breast Knuckles
 
06:26:28.948 --> 06:26:28.958 align:start position:0%
uh slug shots and blackjacks being uh
 
06:26:32.548 --> 06:26:32.558 align:start position:0%
legalized again um this would then if in
 
06:26:34.270 --> 06:26:34.280 align:start position:0%
if that would become legalized this
 
06:26:35.708 --> 06:26:35.718 align:start position:0%
would mean that the state would be the
 
06:26:37.830 --> 06:26:37.840 align:start position:0%
only person with preemption to deal with
 
06:26:39.350 --> 06:26:39.360 align:start position:0%
those laws and they can address them
 
06:26:41.310 --> 06:26:41.320 align:start position:0%
this way we avoid the patchwork like
 
06:26:43.270 --> 06:26:43.280 align:start position:0%
we've heard so many people talk about
 
06:26:44.628 --> 06:26:44.638 align:start position:0%
another interesting thing that I think
 
06:26:48.310 --> 06:26:48.320 align:start position:0%
is it's not a new idea uh RSA 918a it's
 
06:26:50.590 --> 06:26:50.600 align:start position:0%
on line 21 on
 
06:26:55.708 --> 06:26:55.718 align:start position:0%
page one of one um two it's uh basically
 
06:26:58.590 --> 06:26:58.600 align:start position:0%
it's it's a a person agreed to violation
 
06:27:00.868 --> 06:27:00.878 align:start position:0%
May petition the superior court and seek
 
06:27:04.190 --> 06:27:04.200 align:start position:0%
remedy remedies under that RSA uh that
 
06:27:05.670 --> 06:27:05.680 align:start position:0%
can lead to reasonable attorneys fees
 
06:27:07.510 --> 06:27:07.520 align:start position:0%
and costs if you are actually in the
 
06:27:09.030 --> 06:27:09.040 align:start position:0%
right and if you're in the wrong because
 
06:27:10.868 --> 06:27:10.878 align:start position:0%
it's a a malicious lawsuit that was
 
06:27:14.788 --> 06:27:14.798 align:start position:0%
brought about for bad reasons then the
 
06:27:16.350 --> 06:27:16.360 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction the town locality or
 
06:27:17.830 --> 06:27:17.840 align:start position:0%
municipality would be eligible to
 
06:27:20.910 --> 06:27:20.920 align:start position:0%
recover court costs uh also if there is
 
06:27:22.910 --> 06:27:22.920 align:start position:0%
a bad faith effort made say if someone
 
06:27:24.830 --> 06:27:24.840 align:start position:0%
knowingly says oh I know it's legal to
 
06:27:25.868 --> 06:27:25.878 align:start position:0%
have but we're going to make a law
 
06:27:29.030 --> 06:27:29.040 align:start position:0%
anyway that's a bad faith um violation
 
06:27:31.190 --> 06:27:31.200 align:start position:0%
this would give the someone standing to
 
06:27:34.150 --> 06:27:34.160 align:start position:0%
go and have a remedy of between 250 and
 
06:27:36.670 --> 06:27:36.680 align:start position:0%
$2,000 of a civil penalty for bad faith
 
06:27:38.948 --> 06:27:38.958 align:start position:0%
violations plus that person would also
 
06:27:41.310 --> 06:27:41.320 align:start position:0%
be then have to pay the fees and
 
06:27:44.750 --> 06:27:44.760 align:start position:0%
attorney's costs of the uh the the case
 
06:27:46.708 --> 06:27:46.718 align:start position:0%
so that's not new we have that for other
 
06:27:48.390 --> 06:27:48.400 align:start position:0%
for other violations of uh the
 
06:27:50.590 --> 06:27:50.600 align:start position:0%
preemption law and other things but uh
 
06:27:53.830 --> 06:27:53.840 align:start position:0%
this would add these into that uh as far
 
06:27:55.948 --> 06:27:55.958 align:start position:0%
as uh also other self-defense tools
 
06:27:57.270 --> 06:27:57.280 align:start position:0%
isn't just what I mentioned before that
 
06:27:58.430 --> 06:27:58.440 align:start position:0%
we discussed it could be something that
 
06:28:00.390 --> 06:28:00.400 align:start position:0%
may not be invented yet I'm not a big
 
06:28:02.910 --> 06:28:02.920 align:start position:0%
sci-fi fan but I'd love to have a phaser
 
06:28:06.070 --> 06:28:06.080 align:start position:0%
that' be cool um but you
 
06:28:08.548 --> 06:28:08.558 align:start position:0%
know another debate for another time but
 
06:28:10.390 --> 06:28:10.400 align:start position:0%
I think that if some something new came
 
06:28:12.190 --> 06:28:12.200 align:start position:0%
along something that was maybe
 
06:28:13.708 --> 06:28:13.718 align:start position:0%
completely harmless didn't even cause
 
06:28:15.430 --> 06:28:15.440 align:start position:0%
pain just say we came up with something
 
06:28:16.990 --> 06:28:17.000 align:start position:0%
that could freeze someone in space for a
 
06:28:19.070 --> 06:28:19.080 align:start position:0%
moment not you know I don't think it's
 
06:28:20.390 --> 06:28:20.400 align:start position:0%
happening anytime soon but if that
 
06:28:21.868 --> 06:28:21.878 align:start position:0%
happened wouldn't that be something nice
 
06:28:23.830 --> 06:28:23.840 align:start position:0%
to have as a self-defense tool you know
 
06:28:25.628 --> 06:28:25.638 align:start position:0%
we could actually have the state then be
 
06:28:27.070 --> 06:28:27.080 align:start position:0%
the one who's preemptively allowed to
 
06:28:28.590 --> 06:28:28.600 align:start position:0%
take the rights to regulate it like hey
 
06:28:29.868 --> 06:28:29.878 align:start position:0%
you can't just do it on random people
 
06:28:31.390 --> 06:28:31.400 align:start position:0%
we'd obviously have laws for things like
 
06:28:33.510 --> 06:28:33.520 align:start position:0%
that but it would be the state doing it
 
06:28:36.948 --> 06:28:36.958 align:start position:0%
not this NW workk of localities so um
 
06:28:38.590 --> 06:28:38.600 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to take any questions and
 
06:28:40.110 --> 06:28:40.120 align:start position:0%
if not I got to go to a birthday party
 
06:28:43.230 --> 06:28:43.240 align:start position:0%

06:46:00.548 --> 06:46:00.558 align:start position:0%
all right okay with that I'm opening up
 
06:46:24.388 --> 06:46:24.398 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:27.230 --> 06:46:27.240 align:start position:0%
okay I am opening the executive session
 
06:46:31.230 --> 06:46:31.240 align:start position:0%
 
06:46:34.430 --> 06:46:34.440 align:start position:0%
56 and I am recognizing
 
06:46:37.510 --> 06:46:37.520 align:start position:0%
representative rhs to make a
 
06:46:40.468 --> 06:46:40.478 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I move itl
 
06:46:42.350 --> 06:46:42.360 align:start position:0%
for House Bill
 
06:46:45.070 --> 06:46:45.080 align:start position:0%
56 I'll second that seconded by
 
06:46:46.070 --> 06:46:46.080 align:start position:0%
representative appr would you like to
 
06:46:46.990 --> 06:46:47.000 align:start position:0%
speak to your
 
06:46:49.590 --> 06:46:49.600 align:start position:0%
motion sure
 
06:46:53.030 --> 06:46:53.040 align:start position:0%
um I don't really know what has changed
 
06:46:54.948 --> 06:46:54.958 align:start position:0%
from from when we heard this bill last
 
06:46:56.310 --> 06:46:56.320 align:start position:0%
year I do know we have some new members
 
06:46:58.628 --> 06:46:58.638 align:start position:0%
but I didn't hear anything different in
 
06:47:01.628 --> 06:47:01.638 align:start position:0%
the testimony except for the fact that
 
06:47:03.590 --> 06:47:03.600 align:start position:0%
there was not an exception now for
 
06:47:05.590 --> 06:47:05.600 align:start position:0%
somebody that maybe felt their life was
 
06:47:07.948 --> 06:47:07.958 align:start position:0%
you know in danger or was maybe being
 
06:47:10.150 --> 06:47:10.160 align:start position:0%
threatened by somebody uh the reason was
 
06:47:11.350 --> 06:47:11.360 align:start position:0%
given that the person might not be
 
06:47:14.310 --> 06:47:14.320 align:start position:0%
trained I don't it's nice to have people
 
06:47:16.948 --> 06:47:16.958 align:start position:0%
trained but it certainly is not a
 
06:47:21.230 --> 06:47:21.240 align:start position:0%
requirement um and and given this it it
 
06:47:22.548 --> 06:47:22.558 align:start position:0%
there's just nothing about it that I
 
06:47:24.708 --> 06:47:24.718 align:start position:0%
think is good and I really don't think
 
06:47:26.070 --> 06:47:26.080 align:start position:0%
there's much more I can say other than
 
06:47:28.310 --> 06:47:28.320 align:start position:0%
we already all know representative Pro
 
06:47:30.070 --> 06:47:30.080 align:start position:0%
would you like to speak to you a second
 
06:47:32.310 --> 06:47:32.320 align:start position:0%
I tend to agree with that I was really
 
06:47:34.830 --> 06:47:34.840 align:start position:0%
concerned about about that if somebody
 
06:47:36.510 --> 06:47:36.520 align:start position:0%
filed a restraining order on somebody
 
06:47:38.430 --> 06:47:38.440 align:start position:0%
there was an active threat that they
 
06:47:42.868 --> 06:47:42.878 align:start position:0%
still had to wait the 3 days uh the
 
06:47:44.948 --> 06:47:44.958 align:start position:0%
perpetrator has the ability to wait
 
06:47:46.830 --> 06:47:46.840 align:start position:0%
three days get a gun and then go after
 
06:47:51.868 --> 06:47:51.878 align:start position:0%
her uh or him whoever it may be but uh
 
06:47:54.708 --> 06:47:54.718 align:start position:0%
not having the ability or a provision to
 
06:47:57.270 --> 06:47:57.280 align:start position:0%
make that happen
 
06:47:59.468 --> 06:47:59.478 align:start position:0%
um I don't see
 
06:48:02.830 --> 06:48:02.840 align:start position:0%
it thank you um I would add the FBI has
 
06:48:05.708 --> 06:48:05.718 align:start position:0%
something called it time to Crime um
 
06:48:08.030 --> 06:48:08.040 align:start position:0%
records they keep and and that's the
 
06:48:09.948 --> 06:48:09.958 align:start position:0%
time from a fireman's purchase to the
 
06:48:11.628 --> 06:48:11.638 align:start position:0%
time when they actually use it in a
 
06:48:14.788 --> 06:48:14.798 align:start position:0%
crime and I was unable to find any uh
 
06:48:17.190 --> 06:48:17.200 align:start position:0%
numbers uh from New Hampshire where a
 
06:48:19.670 --> 06:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
crime had been committed within 72 hours
 
06:48:22.830 --> 06:48:22.840 align:start position:0%
of being purchased so there's that
 
06:48:22.840 --> 06:48:24.628 align:start position:0%
of being purchased so there's that
further

06:48:24.628 --> 06:48:24.638 align:start position:0%
further
 
06:48:28.468 --> 06:48:28.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:48:31.670 --> 06:48:31.680 align:start position:0%
Muse I'll be uh opposing the the
 
06:48:33.350 --> 06:48:33.360 align:start position:0%
committee recommendation
 
06:48:36.830 --> 06:48:36.840 align:start position:0%
um what this bill really tries to do is
 
06:48:41.388 --> 06:48:41.398 align:start position:0%
to toughen statutes that keep Firearms
 
06:48:43.628 --> 06:48:43.638 align:start position:0%
out of the hands of people that our laws
 
06:48:46.388 --> 06:48:46.398 align:start position:0%
say already should not have those
 
06:48:49.510 --> 06:48:49.520 align:start position:0%
weapons um what we're doing is we're
 
06:48:53.350 --> 06:48:53.360 align:start position:0%
expanding it to uh to Private Sales that
 
06:48:56.868 --> 06:48:56.878 align:start position:0%
don't involve um a licensed Firearms
 
06:48:59.590 --> 06:48:59.600 align:start position:0%
dealer and requiring that a licensed
 
06:49:02.388 --> 06:49:02.398 align:start position:0%
Firearms dealer be part of that process
 
06:49:04.310 --> 06:49:04.320 align:start position:0%
we're not not blocking anybody's access
 
06:49:04.320 --> 06:49:05.030 align:start position:0%
we're not not blocking anybody's access
to

06:49:05.030 --> 06:49:05.040 align:start position:0%
to
 
06:49:08.868 --> 06:49:08.878 align:start position:0%
Firearms um uh all we're asking is that
 
06:49:11.670 --> 06:49:11.680 align:start position:0%
people pass the same type of background
 
06:49:13.948 --> 06:49:13.958 align:start position:0%
check that they would have to pass if
 
06:49:15.590 --> 06:49:15.600 align:start position:0%
they purchased the weapon from the
 
06:49:18.910 --> 06:49:18.920 align:start position:0%
dealer um this is not an unreasonable
 
06:49:22.750 --> 06:49:22.760 align:start position:0%
thing uh to do uh this is a common sense
 
06:49:25.430 --> 06:49:25.440 align:start position:0%
Public Safety measure uh the bill was
 
06:49:29.190 --> 06:49:29.200 align:start position:0%
written extremely carefully um with
 
06:49:31.708 --> 06:49:31.718 align:start position:0%
input from a lot of different folks a
 
06:49:34.750 --> 06:49:34.760 align:start position:0%
lot of different constit encies um we
 
06:49:37.628 --> 06:49:37.638 align:start position:0%
went out of our way uh to address some
 
06:49:40.468 --> 06:49:40.478 align:start position:0%
of the objections that we've heard uh uh
 
06:49:44.070 --> 06:49:44.080 align:start position:0%
when previous uh uh I I won't say
 
06:49:45.990 --> 06:49:46.000 align:start position:0%
previous versions of this bill but when
 
06:49:47.628 --> 06:49:47.638 align:start position:0%
when other bills that tried to do the
 
06:49:50.230 --> 06:49:50.240 align:start position:0%
same thing were introduced um and we
 
06:49:53.350 --> 06:49:53.360 align:start position:0%
think we satisfactorily met those things
 
06:49:56.070 --> 06:49:56.080 align:start position:0%
so I I think the the issue is is when
 
06:49:57.750 --> 06:49:57.760 align:start position:0%
you're looking to kill a bill like this
 
06:49:59.830 --> 06:49:59.840 align:start position:0%
you'll always find a reason to kill it
 
06:50:01.708 --> 06:50:01.718 align:start position:0%
but there are far more reasons to pass
 
06:50:03.590 --> 06:50:03.600 align:start position:0%
this bill than the Killer
 
06:50:03.600 --> 06:50:04.628 align:start position:0%
this bill than the Killer

um this is just this is not a obviously
 
06:51:44.150 --> 06:51:44.160 align:start position:0%
a firearm um my understanding is this
 
06:51:45.670 --> 06:51:45.680 align:start position:0%
you know these are at this point
 
06:51:48.110 --> 06:51:48.120 align:start position:0%
basically collector's items um I know
 
06:51:49.590 --> 06:51:49.600 align:start position:0%
there's been some back and forth with
 
06:51:52.948 --> 06:51:52.958 align:start position:0%
the Senate you know passing inter or
 
06:51:54.468 --> 06:51:54.478 align:start position:0%
passing and doing different study
 
06:51:56.548 --> 06:51:56.558 align:start position:0%
committees um so we're we're going to
 
06:51:57.990 --> 06:51:58.000 align:start position:0%
pass it again and send it back over and
 
06:51:58.990 --> 06:51:59.000 align:start position:0%
see what they
 
06:52:02.030 --> 06:52:02.040 align:start position:0%
say thank you representative um Pro
 
06:52:04.910 --> 06:52:04.920 align:start position:0%
would you like speak to your second I
 
06:52:10.468 --> 06:52:10.478 align:start position:0%
 
06:52:14.948 --> 06:52:14.958 align:start position:0%
um defense weapons
 
06:52:17.750 --> 06:52:17.760 align:start position:0%
um I'd rather get hit by a blackjack
 
06:52:21.868 --> 06:52:21.878 align:start position:0%
than get shot right so I mean somebody's
 
06:52:23.590 --> 06:52:23.600 align:start position:0%
attacking me and I'm in a spot that I
 
06:52:26.030 --> 06:52:26.040 align:start position:0%
can't carry a gun because somebody had a
 
06:52:29.430 --> 06:52:29.440 align:start position:0%
a rules or it wasn't convenient and I
 
06:52:33.948 --> 06:52:33.958 align:start position:0%
had one of these um
 
06:52:35.310 --> 06:52:35.320 align:start position:0%
it would be nice to
 
06:52:40.350 --> 06:52:40.360 align:start position:0%
have right now I can use a aspon
 
06:52:43.310 --> 06:52:43.320 align:start position:0%
that's more powerful than the
 
06:52:47.230 --> 06:52:47.240 align:start position:0%
blackjack or the knuckles so I don't see
 
06:52:49.468 --> 06:52:49.478 align:start position:0%
why we can't bring these back and take
 
06:52:52.110 --> 06:52:52.120 align:start position:0%
them off the list um again there's not
 
06:52:55.350 --> 06:52:55.360 align:start position:0%
many of them around um and and again
 
06:52:58.310 --> 06:52:58.320 align:start position:0%
truly is mostly col collectors with
 
06:53:02.590 --> 06:53:02.600 align:start position:0%
these thank you um I I would say this um
 
06:53:06.948 --> 06:53:06.958 align:start position:0%
um I can I can carry a a samurai sword
 
06:53:09.708 --> 06:53:09.718 align:start position:0%
um down the street I can carry a samurai
 
06:53:13.110 --> 06:53:13.120 align:start position:0%
sword wherever I want I can carry a
 
06:53:15.590 --> 06:53:15.600 align:start position:0%
baseball bat I can carry an electrical
 
06:53:17.948 --> 06:53:17.958 align:start position:0%
weapon that will knock you out for a few
 
06:53:19.868 --> 06:53:19.878 align:start position:0%
minutes I can carry spray that will
 
06:53:21.868 --> 06:53:21.878 align:start position:0%
blind you I can carry all kinds of
 
06:53:24.350 --> 06:53:24.360 align:start position:0%
things but I can't carry these and I was
 
06:53:26.468 --> 06:53:26.478 align:start position:0%
particularly moved by the testimony that
 
06:53:28.548 --> 06:53:28.558 align:start position:0%
pointed out the history if you think
 
06:53:29.788 --> 06:53:29.798 align:start position:0%
about it for a minute and look at this
 
06:53:31.830 --> 06:53:31.840 align:start position:0%
list of things these are things that
 
06:53:33.868 --> 06:53:33.878 align:start position:0%
were carried by long showman and
 
06:53:35.590 --> 06:53:35.600 align:start position:0%
fishermen and who would get their
 
06:53:37.548 --> 06:53:37.558 align:start position:0%
paycheck when their boat came back in
 
06:53:39.830 --> 06:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
and go to the to the bar and and tear it
 
06:53:41.510 --> 06:53:41.520 align:start position:0%
up and hit each other with blackjacks
 
06:53:44.548 --> 06:53:44.558 align:start position:0%
and and fish killers and that's really
 
06:53:46.190 --> 06:53:46.200 align:start position:0%
what those things are for is killing a
 
06:53:50.030 --> 06:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
fish um this is a bygone error type of
 
06:53:52.230 --> 06:53:52.240 align:start position:0%
thing and it's not protecting anyone uh
 
06:53:54.388 --> 06:53:54.398 align:start position:0%
I don't even know where you would get uh
 
06:53:56.948 --> 06:53:56.958 align:start position:0%
brass knuckles I I last night I looked
 
06:53:58.388 --> 06:53:58.398 align:start position:0%
online I couldn't even find any place to
 
06:54:02.510 --> 06:54:02.520 align:start position:0%
order them so um it seems silly that we
 
06:54:05.548 --> 06:54:05.558 align:start position:0%
are outlawing the thing that David used
 
06:54:09.590 --> 06:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
to kill Goliath 4,000 years later so um
 
06:54:12.430 --> 06:54:12.440 align:start position:0%
I'm going to move and vote um off to
 
06:54:15.750 --> 06:54:15.760 align:start position:0%
pass representative Murray thank you Mr
 
06:54:19.590 --> 06:54:19.600 align:start position:0%
chair um I agree that uh it's silly to
 
06:54:21.628 --> 06:54:21.638 align:start position:0%
ban these things and I also think it's
 
06:54:23.110 --> 06:54:23.120 align:start position:0%
silly that we keep trying to pass this
 
06:54:25.628 --> 06:54:25.638 align:start position:0%
bill and so I've voted for it the past
 
06:54:27.868 --> 06:54:27.878 align:start position:0%
two times but this time I'm going to
 
06:54:30.030 --> 06:54:30.040 align:start position:0%
vote against all to pass motion because
 
06:54:31.430 --> 06:54:31.440 align:start position:0%
I don't understand why we're going ring
 
06:54:33.590 --> 06:54:33.600 align:start position:0%
around the rosie with the on
 
06:54:36.388 --> 06:54:36.398 align:start position:0%
this maybe maybe your changing your vote
 
06:54:38.310 --> 06:54:38.320 align:start position:0%
will be what it takes I don't know did
 
06:54:40.670 --> 06:54:40.680 align:start position:0%
you have your hand up represent
 
06:54:45.310 --> 06:54:45.320 align:start position:0%
 
06:54:47.670 --> 06:54:47.680 align:start position:0%
Muse one thing I would like to say about
 
06:54:50.110 --> 06:54:50.120 align:start position:0%
this bill is um I think all you have to
 
06:54:53.830 --> 06:54:53.840 align:start position:0%
do uh is go out there and Google uh
 
06:54:57.708 --> 06:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
blackjacks assault breast Knuckles uh
 
06:54:59.670 --> 06:54:59.680 align:start position:0%
and you will literally get hundreds of
 
06:55:03.430 --> 06:55:03.440 align:start position:0%
cases that show up so these are not uh
 
06:55:05.110 --> 06:55:05.120 align:start position:0%
injuries that we're reading about from
 
06:55:08.788 --> 06:55:08.798 align:start position:0%
the 17th century in Dusty books um these
 
06:55:11.110 --> 06:55:11.120 align:start position:0%
are things that we can go online when we
 
06:55:15.548 --> 06:55:15.558 align:start position:0%
can read about now um uh there was a
 
06:55:20.030 --> 06:55:20.040 align:start position:0%
case uh last year uh a woman was sitting
 
06:55:22.910 --> 06:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
at a at a stop sign a guy tried to hi
 
06:55:25.350 --> 06:55:25.360 align:start position:0%
had tried to carjack her car uh reaches
 
06:55:27.670 --> 06:55:27.680 align:start position:0%
in through the window um hits her with
 
06:55:33.070 --> 06:55:33.080 align:start position:0%
brass knuckles in the face um uh if you
 
06:55:35.030 --> 06:55:35.040 align:start position:0%
if you if you look for this thing online
 
06:55:37.270 --> 06:55:37.280 align:start position:0%
I mean the damage to the face of this
 
06:55:41.388 --> 06:55:41.398 align:start position:0%
woman um uh was something you you know
 
06:55:43.708 --> 06:55:43.718 align:start position:0%
you wouldn't believe so the these are
 
06:55:47.350 --> 06:55:47.360 align:start position:0%
not um you know fun little antiques that
 
06:55:49.070 --> 06:55:49.080 align:start position:0%
people put on their shelves there may be
 
06:55:51.510 --> 06:55:51.520 align:start position:0%
some people who do that but there are
 
06:55:53.510 --> 06:55:53.520 align:start position:0%
people who actually use these weapons
 
06:55:55.548 --> 06:55:55.558 align:start position:0%
they take them into bars they take them
 
06:55:58.430 --> 06:55:58.440 align:start position:0%
into situations where uh where
 
06:56:01.230 --> 06:56:01.240 align:start position:0%
frankly um what they do is they
 
06:56:03.070 --> 06:56:03.080 align:start position:0%
essentially serve as a a force
 
06:56:06.030 --> 06:56:06.040 align:start position:0%
multiplier for for somebody's fist when
 
06:56:09.350 --> 06:56:09.360 align:start position:0%
I hit somebody with my fist um in these
 
06:56:11.628 --> 06:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
days I I I I don't generate anywhere
 
06:56:14.628 --> 06:56:14.638 align:start position:0%
near as much power as maybe I I used to
 
06:56:16.910 --> 06:56:16.920 align:start position:0%
but the damage is pretty minimal I go
 
06:56:19.750 --> 06:56:19.760 align:start position:0%
and put on a pair of breast Knuckles uh
 
06:56:22.270 --> 06:56:22.280 align:start position:0%
and I can break somebody's orbital bone
 
06:56:25.310 --> 06:56:25.320 align:start position:0%
um I they can they might need 50
 
06:56:27.948 --> 06:56:27.958 align:start position:0%
stitches for their face you know these
 
06:56:30.590 --> 06:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
weapons are designed to take that force
 
06:56:32.990 --> 06:56:33.000 align:start position:0%
and to and and to multiply it and they
 
06:56:35.230 --> 06:56:35.240 align:start position:0%
cause Grievous injuries and there's
 
06:56:37.430 --> 06:56:37.440 align:start position:0%
evidence of that if we care to look for
 
06:56:38.910 --> 06:56:38.920 align:start position:0%
it and and I think one of the things
 
06:56:40.910 --> 06:56:40.920 align:start position:0%
that we shouldn't do with this committee
 
06:56:43.110 --> 06:56:43.120 align:start position:0%
is tell ourselves nice little stories
 
06:56:47.110 --> 06:56:47.120 align:start position:0%
like this that basically are not true uh
 
06:56:49.150 --> 06:56:49.160 align:start position:0%
there's a lot of evidence that these
 
06:56:51.670 --> 06:56:51.680 align:start position:0%
weapons are harmful and that they should
 
06:56:54.310 --> 06:56:54.320 align:start position:0%
stay prohibited in New
 
06:56:56.990 --> 06:56:57.000 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I can likewise Google for
 
06:57:00.110 --> 06:57:00.120 align:start position:0%
hours and look at Hammer attacks and and
 
06:57:02.910 --> 06:57:02.920 align:start position:0%
knife attacks and all these other I mean
 
06:57:04.708 --> 06:57:04.718 align:start position:0%
Britain right now is is riddled with
 
06:57:07.590 --> 06:57:07.600 align:start position:0%
knife attacks and they're discussing leg
 
06:57:10.868 --> 06:57:10.878 align:start position:0%
making a license to buy a steak Knife um
 
06:57:14.468 --> 06:57:14.478 align:start position:0%
so that that doesn't seem to help so um
 
06:57:14.478 --> 06:57:16.590 align:start position:0%
so that that doesn't seem to help so um
representative

06:57:16.590 --> 06:57:16.600 align:start position:0%
representative
 
06:57:16.600 --> 06:57:18.310 align:start position:0%
representative
who

06:57:18.310 --> 06:57:18.320 align:start position:0%
who
 
06:57:21.750 --> 06:57:21.760 align:start position:0%
pette I was just going to say um as far
 
06:57:24.270 --> 06:57:24.280 align:start position:0%
as a force multiplier I mean you don't
 
06:57:26.350 --> 06:57:26.360 align:start position:0%
need to use one of these items to be a
 
06:57:29.230 --> 06:57:29.240 align:start position:0%
force multiplier um you know I once
 
06:57:31.590 --> 06:57:31.600 align:start position:0%
broke somebody's orbit with my boot you
 
06:57:33.910 --> 06:57:33.920 align:start position:0%
know and if I wanted to hurt somebody
 
06:57:35.670 --> 06:57:35.680 align:start position:0%
here you know I could use my fist I
 
06:57:37.708 --> 06:57:37.718 align:start position:0%
could use that stick I could use a gavel
 
06:57:39.548 --> 06:57:39.558 align:start position:0%
so any of those other things could be a
 
06:57:41.868 --> 06:57:41.878 align:start position:0%
force multiplier you know and I don't
 
06:57:43.430 --> 06:57:43.440 align:start position:0%
have to go out and specifically buy any
 
06:57:46.590 --> 06:57:46.600 align:start position:0%
of those so I don't know that you know
 
06:57:49.670 --> 06:57:49.680 align:start position:0%
that would be more lethal than the
 
06:57:52.350 --> 06:57:52.360 align:start position:0%
other thank you uh representative Sher
 
06:57:53.670 --> 06:57:53.680 align:start position:0%
yeah I I wasn't going to say anything
 
06:57:56.948 --> 06:57:56.958 align:start position:0%
but I've been provoked now um you know
 
06:57:59.270 --> 06:57:59.280 align:start position:0%
when we're talking about knives steak
 
06:58:01.230 --> 06:58:01.240 align:start position:0%
knives and things like that they have
 
06:58:02.750 --> 06:58:02.760 align:start position:0%
other uses
 
06:58:05.030 --> 06:58:05.040 align:start position:0%
the things we're talking about here are
 
06:58:07.190 --> 06:58:07.200 align:start position:0%
brass knuckles don't have other put
 
06:58:09.110 --> 06:58:09.120 align:start position:0%
aside The Collector item issue brass
 
06:58:10.948 --> 06:58:10.958 align:start position:0%
knuckles don't have another use
 
06:58:13.270 --> 06:58:13.280 align:start position:0%
blackjacks don't have another use and
 
06:58:16.230 --> 06:58:16.240 align:start position:0%
and that that's the difference uh second
 
06:58:19.590 --> 06:58:19.600 align:start position:0%
I um back in the 80s again this is
 
06:58:21.310 --> 06:58:21.320 align:start position:0%
somewhat ancient history but I
 
06:58:23.708 --> 06:58:23.718 align:start position:0%
represented a number of people who were
 
06:58:28.150 --> 06:58:28.160 align:start position:0%
charged with uh who did significant
 
06:58:31.750 --> 06:58:31.760 align:start position:0%
damage to people with blackjacks and uh
 
06:58:34.750 --> 06:58:34.760 align:start position:0%
with brass knuckles uh some without
 
06:58:36.230 --> 06:58:36.240 align:start position:0%
getting into the details some were
 
06:58:39.590 --> 06:58:39.600 align:start position:0%
convicted some were not convicted but um
 
06:58:41.110 --> 06:58:41.120 align:start position:0%
that's my
 
06:58:44.270 --> 06:58:44.280 align:start position:0%
concern and your point is well taken but
 
06:58:46.788 --> 06:58:46.798 align:start position:0%
I would go back to um a sword has one
 
06:58:50.230 --> 06:58:50.240 align:start position:0%
purpose um and so does a firearm and we
 
06:58:51.708 --> 06:58:51.718 align:start position:0%
don't make those illegal and as a matter
 
06:58:53.350 --> 06:58:53.360 align:start position:0%
of fact the Supreme Court has said that
 
06:58:55.190 --> 06:58:55.200 align:start position:0%
the electric weapons and weapons like
 
06:58:57.510 --> 06:58:57.520 align:start position:0%
that in common use fall under the Second
 
06:59:00.230 --> 06:59:00.240 align:start position:0%
Amendment um whether we like it or not
 
06:59:02.910 --> 06:59:02.920 align:start position:0%
it it it is the truth so I it doesn't
 
06:59:04.708 --> 06:59:04.718 align:start position:0%
make sense to me that we some things are
 
06:59:07.190 --> 06:59:07.200 align:start position:0%
legal and some things are not when the
 
06:59:10.070 --> 06:59:10.080 align:start position:0%
more devastating things are legal um it
 
06:59:12.910 --> 06:59:12.920 align:start position:0%
doesn't make any sense as I said that
 
06:59:14.590 --> 06:59:14.600 align:start position:0%
that the weapon that Davy used to kill
 
06:59:17.590 --> 06:59:17.600 align:start position:0%
Goliath we make illegal um see no
 
06:59:18.910 --> 06:59:18.920 align:start position:0%
further discussion ask the clerk to call
 
06:59:20.548 --> 06:59:20.558 align:start position:0%

06:59:22.708 --> 06:59:22.718 align:start position:0%

87 motion carries um who was going to do
 
07:00:07.110 --> 07:00:07.120 align:start position:0%
 
07:00:10.270 --> 07:00:10.280 align:start position:0%
Report representative here at gaite um

07:00:18.990 --> 07:00:19.000 align:start position:0%
Tuesday and I'll I'll do the majority
 
07:00:22.070 --> 07:00:22.080 align:start position:0%
report I have to argue with anyway with
 
07:00:24.150 --> 07:00:24.160 align:start position:0%
that I close the executive session I
 
07:00:29.190 --> 07:00:29.200 align:start position:0%
open the executive session on House Bill
 
07:00:32.590 --> 07:00:32.600 align:start position:0%
352 and recognize myself for motion I
 
07:00:34.310 --> 07:00:34.320 align:start position:0%
move inexpedient to
 
07:00:38.030 --> 07:00:38.040 align:start position:0%
legislate I'll second that um thank you
 
07:00:42.670 --> 07:00:42.680 align:start position:0%
I will speak to my motion um
 
07:00:44.990 --> 07:00:45.000 align:start position:0%
the polling
 
07:00:48.110 --> 07:00:48.120 align:start position:0%
place issue to me is
 
07:00:51.230 --> 07:00:51.240 align:start position:0%
again it it's about this thing we put in
 
07:00:54.628 --> 07:00:54.638 align:start position:0%
our head about geography um you know 100
 
07:00:57.590 --> 07:00:57.600 align:start position:0%
feet here I can 100 feet there I can't
 
07:00:59.990 --> 07:01:00.000 align:start position:0%
it it doesn't it doesn't make any sense
 
07:01:02.150 --> 07:01:02.160 align:start position:0%
um people that say well it can be
 
07:01:04.510 --> 07:01:04.520 align:start position:0%
intimidating I haven't I didn't hear any
 
07:01:06.990 --> 07:01:07.000 align:start position:0%
cases nor has anyone come forward to
 
07:01:08.590 --> 07:01:08.600 align:start position:0%
testify that there were cases of
 
07:01:10.430 --> 07:01:10.440 align:start position:0%
intimidation in the Hampshire with with
 
07:01:13.070 --> 07:01:13.080 align:start position:0%
Firearms at a polling place um it's
 
07:01:14.990 --> 07:01:15.000 align:start position:0%
against the law to to Menace someone
 
07:01:17.548 --> 07:01:17.558 align:start position:0%
with a firearm already police are
 
07:01:19.310 --> 07:01:19.320 align:start position:0%
already there they would make an arrest
 
07:01:21.548 --> 07:01:21.558 align:start position:0%
for that the case the fact that someone
 
07:01:24.830 --> 07:01:24.840 align:start position:0%
sees a firearm and becomes nervous um
 
07:01:28.310 --> 07:01:28.320 align:start position:0%
that's that's um unfortunate but we are
 
07:01:30.150 --> 07:01:30.160 align:start position:0%
the United States and this is New
 
07:01:32.548 --> 07:01:32.558 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and we do have firearms
 
07:01:35.868 --> 07:01:35.878 align:start position:0%
so making someone have to disarm
 
07:01:38.910 --> 07:01:38.920 align:start position:0%
themselves to stop off and vote
 
07:01:40.150 --> 07:01:40.160 align:start position:0%
especially if they're going somewhere
 
07:01:42.150 --> 07:01:42.160 align:start position:0%
else afterwards it just doesn't make any
 
07:01:44.310 --> 07:01:44.320 align:start position:0%
sense that we're going to take away one
 
07:01:46.948 --> 07:01:46.958 align:start position:0%
right so that you can do another and
 
07:01:51.070 --> 07:01:51.080 align:start position:0%
expanding the um absentee voting um
 
07:01:53.990 --> 07:01:54.000 align:start position:0%
absolutely no um we've already expanded
 
07:01:55.468 --> 07:01:55.478 align:start position:0%
that quite far enough as far as I'm
 
07:01:56.830 --> 07:01:56.840 align:start position:0%
concerned would you like to speak to
 
07:01:59.310 --> 07:01:59.320 align:start position:0%
your second representative Pro uh he
 
07:02:02.350 --> 07:02:02.360 align:start position:0%
covered most of it but I
 
07:02:03.948 --> 07:02:03.958 align:start position:0%
when the sponsors said it well if you
 
07:02:05.830 --> 07:02:05.840 align:start position:0%
feel uncomfortable without your gun you
 
07:02:09.788 --> 07:02:09.798 align:start position:0%
can do absentee voting and I just say it
 
07:02:11.510 --> 07:02:11.520 align:start position:0%
goes the other way around
 
07:02:16.110 --> 07:02:16.120 align:start position:0%
too but I agree it shouldn't be
 
07:02:19.270 --> 07:02:19.280 align:start position:0%
unarming yeah and I would I would just
 
07:02:23.150 --> 07:02:23.160 align:start position:0%
add schools um are sometimes polling
 
07:02:25.750 --> 07:02:25.760 align:start position:0%
places um and that was raised as you
 
07:02:27.910 --> 07:02:27.920 align:start position:0%
know as if the children well first of
 
07:02:29.468 --> 07:02:29.478 align:start position:0%
all generally when there's a polling
 
07:02:31.510 --> 07:02:31.520 align:start position:0%
going on the school's closed second of
 
07:02:33.310 --> 07:02:33.320 align:start position:0%
all federal law says you can't carry a
 
07:02:35.230 --> 07:02:35.240 align:start position:0%
firearm into a school unless you have a
 
07:02:37.990 --> 07:02:38.000 align:start position:0%
license um and the people that still
 
07:02:39.310 --> 07:02:39.320 align:start position:0%
have licenses have gone through
 
07:02:41.070 --> 07:02:41.080 align:start position:0%
background checks and to buy a firearm
 
07:02:43.868 --> 07:02:43.878 align:start position:0%
you've had a background check that's all
 
07:02:46.548 --> 07:02:46.558 align:start position:0%
further discussion representative Murray
 
07:02:49.628 --> 07:02:49.638 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair um I just wanted to
 
07:02:51.150 --> 07:02:51.160 align:start position:0%
State for the record that while I
 
07:02:52.350 --> 07:02:52.360 align:start position:0%
personally don't believe that your
 
07:02:54.190 --> 07:02:54.200 align:start position:0%
second amendment rights disappear when
 
07:02:55.628 --> 07:02:55.638 align:start position:0%
you go into a polling place I will be
 
07:02:57.868 --> 07:02:57.878 align:start position:0%
voting um as my constituents have
 
07:03:00.110 --> 07:03:00.120 align:start position:0%
requested against this bill and with my
 
07:03:00.120 --> 07:03:01.990 align:start position:0%
requested against this bill and with my
caucus

07:03:01.990 --> 07:03:02.000 align:start position:0%
caucus
 
07:03:02.000 --> 07:03:04.190 align:start position:0%
caucus
thank

07:03:04.190 --> 07:03:04.200 align:start position:0%
thank
 
07:03:06.590 --> 07:03:06.600 align:start position:0%
you see no further discussion ask the
 
07:03:07.948 --> 07:03:07.958 align:start position:0%
cler to call the rooll motion on the
 
07:03:11.388 --> 07:03:11.398 align:start position:0%
floor is
 
07:03:14.030 --> 07:03:14.040 align:start position:0%
what go
 
07:03:17.070 --> 07:03:17.080 align:start position:0%
ahead I think one of the one of the most
 
07:03:19.150 --> 07:03:19.160 align:start position:0%
sacred things in this country uh is
 
07:03:22.948 --> 07:03:22.958 align:start position:0%
being able to go into a polling place uh
 
07:03:25.468 --> 07:03:25.478 align:start position:0%
and vote
 
07:03:30.388 --> 07:03:30.398 align:start position:0%
um what this bill does is address a long
 
07:03:32.270 --> 07:03:32.280 align:start position:0%
history uh in this
 
07:03:35.788 --> 07:03:35.798 align:start position:0%
country of voting intimidation and what
 
07:03:38.750 --> 07:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
it does is it lowers the risk of voter
 
07:03:40.910 --> 07:03:40.920 align:start position:0%
intimidation when I introduced a similar
 
07:03:43.430 --> 07:03:43.440 align:start position:0%
Bill four years ago we actually amended
 
07:03:45.670 --> 07:03:45.680 align:start position:0%
the voter intimidation statute uh
 
07:03:48.030 --> 07:03:48.040 align:start position:0%
instead of the gun statute uh for this
 
07:03:51.110 --> 07:03:51.120 align:start position:0%
bill because what this what this act
 
07:03:54.150 --> 07:03:54.160 align:start position:0%
does and and what the risk is is that
 
07:03:55.830 --> 07:03:55.840 align:start position:0%
people will be
 
07:03:59.468 --> 07:03:59.478 align:start position:0%
intimidated the I think given the level
 
07:04:02.230 --> 07:04:02.240 align:start position:0%
of of division that we have
 
07:04:04.708 --> 07:04:04.718 align:start position:0%
uh in this country and given the focus
 
07:04:07.910 --> 07:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
that so many people have on voting and
 
07:04:09.590 --> 07:04:09.600 align:start position:0%
the voting process one of the things
 
07:04:12.310 --> 07:04:12.320 align:start position:0%
that we've already seen our po po
 
07:04:15.110 --> 07:04:15.120 align:start position:0%
workers have been threatened uh people
 
07:04:17.990 --> 07:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
have stood uh PE armed people have stood
 
07:04:22.310 --> 07:04:22.320 align:start position:0%
near Dropbox dropboxes uh in places uh
 
07:04:25.350 --> 07:04:25.360 align:start position:0%
like Arizona um this is behavior that we
 
07:04:28.510 --> 07:04:28.520 align:start position:0%
are seeing um we've actually seen it uh
 
07:04:31.910 --> 07:04:31.920 align:start position:0%
in Manchester in the 2020 election
 
07:04:35.030 --> 07:04:35.040 align:start position:0%
so the bottom line is does it does it H
 
07:04:37.548 --> 07:04:37.558 align:start position:0%
has it happened a lot uh to to this
 
07:04:40.788 --> 07:04:40.798 align:start position:0%
point I think it's happened enough uh to
 
07:04:43.750 --> 07:04:43.760 align:start position:0%
justify some precaution and uh and I
 
07:04:47.230 --> 07:04:47.240 align:start position:0%
think this is a a sensible precaution uh
 
07:04:49.270 --> 07:04:49.280 align:start position:0%
that we should take and it's a sensible
 
07:04:51.110 --> 07:04:51.120 align:start position:0%
precaution that some states have been
 
07:04:54.910 --> 07:04:54.920 align:start position:0%
taken taking taken since
 
07:04:58.150 --> 07:04:58.160 align:start position:0%
1776 uh when the Constitution was first
 
07:05:00.948 --> 07:05:00.958 align:start position:0%
written um I think there's a there's a
 
07:05:04.750 --> 07:05:04.760 align:start position:0%
general recog nition that no right uh is
 
07:05:06.628 --> 07:05:06.638 align:start position:0%
absolute and if you look at article 3 of
 
07:05:08.750 --> 07:05:08.760 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Constitution one of
 
07:05:10.830 --> 07:05:10.840 align:start position:0%
the things that you'll see is that we
 
07:05:14.628 --> 07:05:14.638 align:start position:0%
basically we basically say that so there
 
07:05:18.388 --> 07:05:18.398 align:start position:0%
are situations where the right of people
 
07:05:23.110 --> 07:05:23.120 align:start position:0%
to be uh to be safe um and and to be in
 
07:05:23.120 --> 07:05:23.948 align:start position:0%
to be uh to be safe um and and to be in
a

07:05:23.948 --> 07:05:23.958 align:start position:0%
a
 
07:05:26.510 --> 07:05:26.520 align:start position:0%
situation where they can you know
 
07:05:28.070 --> 07:05:28.080 align:start position:0%
exercise their rights
 
07:05:32.310 --> 07:05:32.320 align:start position:0%
safely does um at times
 
07:05:36.150 --> 07:05:36.160 align:start position:0%
uh o overcome an individual right um and
 
07:05:38.230 --> 07:05:38.240 align:start position:0%
this is a and I think one of the things
 
07:05:41.948 --> 07:05:41.958 align:start position:0%
that we have to do um
 
07:05:45.070 --> 07:05:45.080 align:start position:0%
is you know when we make law is we need
 
07:05:48.030 --> 07:05:48.040 align:start position:0%
to achieve some sort of level uh of
 
07:05:50.670 --> 07:05:50.680 align:start position:0%
balance and that balance does not always
 
07:05:53.070 --> 07:05:53.080 align:start position:0%
mean that if it's a second amendment
 
07:05:55.350 --> 07:05:55.360 align:start position:0%
issue it tips over every other right
 
07:05:56.670 --> 07:05:56.680 align:start position:0%
that people
 
07:06:00.750 --> 07:06:00.760 align:start position:0%
have so that's where I am on this and
 
07:06:05.350 --> 07:06:05.360 align:start position:0%
that's why um voting against the itl
 
07:06:07.030 --> 07:06:07.040 align:start position:0%
recommendation thank you further
 
07:06:09.350 --> 07:06:09.360 align:start position:0%
discussion representative Sher uh being
 
07:06:11.548 --> 07:06:11.558 align:start position:0%
the man of compromise that I am I think
 
07:06:13.628 --> 07:06:13.638 align:start position:0%
the the the obvious compromise here
 
07:06:16.388 --> 07:06:16.398 align:start position:0%
which was raised initially by the chair
 
07:06:19.030 --> 07:06:19.040 align:start position:0%
uh is that we change the word carry to
 
07:06:22.628 --> 07:06:22.638 align:start position:0%
clearly display uh and I think that that
 
07:06:24.948 --> 07:06:24.958 align:start position:0%
meets all the concerns here my
 
07:06:27.110 --> 07:06:27.120 align:start position:0%
understanding is a procedurally that's
 
07:06:30.468 --> 07:06:30.478 align:start position:0%
going to arise in another context so uh
 
07:06:33.590 --> 07:06:33.600 align:start position:0%
 
07:06:36.830 --> 07:06:36.840 align:start position:0%
uh I'm going to vote itl on
 
07:06:39.030 --> 07:06:39.040 align:start position:0%
this thank you further
 
07:06:41.270 --> 07:06:41.280 align:start position:0%

07:08:06.548 --> 07:08:06.558 align:start position:0%
recognize representative um rhs for a
 
07:08:08.990 --> 07:08:09.000 align:start position:0%
motion thank you Mr chairman I would
 
07:08:13.910 --> 07:08:13.920 align:start position:0%
move ought to pass for um HB 381 but I
 
07:08:16.830 --> 07:08:16.840 align:start position:0%
would like to yield to uh the chairman
 
07:08:20.110 --> 07:08:20.120 align:start position:0%
to just do the brief discussion as I was
 
07:08:23.468 --> 07:08:23.478 align:start position:0%
focusing on an amendment sure um I'll
 
07:08:25.270 --> 07:08:25.280 align:start position:0%
second it and then I'll speak to
 
07:08:30.190 --> 07:08:30.200 align:start position:0%
it so I seconded that um this this um
 
07:08:35.230 --> 07:08:35.240 align:start position:0%
Bill presents an an interesting um
 
07:08:41.190 --> 07:08:41.200 align:start position:0%
legal perspective for us it it discusses
 
07:08:45.590 --> 07:08:45.600 align:start position:0%
exempting Firearms um built in in the
 
07:08:48.990 --> 07:08:49.000 align:start position:0%
state of New Hampshire and sold within
 
07:08:50.430 --> 07:08:50.440 align:start position:0%
the state of New Hampshire from the
 
07:08:53.910 --> 07:08:53.920 align:start position:0%
National Firearms Act and it's according
 
07:08:57.310 --> 07:08:57.320 align:start position:0%
to the sponsor it's designed to elicit
 
07:08:59.830 --> 07:08:59.840 align:start position:0%
um or provoke the federal government
 
07:09:03.548 --> 07:09:03.558 align:start position:0%
into uh trying to enforce force
 
07:09:06.910 --> 07:09:06.920 align:start position:0%
their oversight through the 14th
 
07:09:10.788 --> 07:09:10.798 align:start position:0%
Amendment um in what we would say is a
 
07:09:14.110 --> 07:09:14.120 align:start position:0%
overreach by using
 
07:09:18.788 --> 07:09:18.798 align:start position:0%
the um the laws that they have to get
 
07:09:20.510 --> 07:09:20.520 align:start position:0%
into Commerce the interstate commerce
 
07:09:22.230 --> 07:09:22.240 align:start position:0%
clause where they have
 
07:09:24.708 --> 07:09:24.718 align:start position:0%
overextended their reach into so many
 
07:09:27.430 --> 07:09:27.440 align:start position:0%
things in so many states um a good
 
07:09:29.270 --> 07:09:29.280 align:start position:0%
example was brought up with regard to
 
07:09:31.708 --> 07:09:31.718 align:start position:0%
Farmers and and their ability to control
 
07:09:33.350 --> 07:09:33.360 align:start position:0%
what you grow in your property within
 
07:09:35.270 --> 07:09:35.280 align:start position:0%
the state so while this is about the
 
07:09:37.190 --> 07:09:37.200 align:start position:0%
Firearms Act it's more than that it's
 
07:09:38.628 --> 07:09:38.638 align:start position:0%
about the government's Federal
 
07:09:41.948 --> 07:09:41.958 align:start position:0%
government's overrate using the um
 
07:09:44.990 --> 07:09:45.000 align:start position:0%
Commerce Clause and the sponsor feels
 
07:09:46.070 --> 07:09:46.080 align:start position:0%
like it
 
07:09:49.430 --> 07:09:49.440 align:start position:0%
would get that case moving um whether
 
07:09:51.030 --> 07:09:51.040 align:start position:0%
that happens remains to be seen but
 
07:09:54.270 --> 07:09:54.280 align:start position:0%
we're going to support it further
 
07:09:57.868 --> 07:09:57.878 align:start position:0%
discussion representative share yeah I I
 
07:10:00.110 --> 07:10:00.120 align:start position:0%
I'm just as a law professor I'm not a
 
07:10:03.070 --> 07:10:03.080 align:start position:0%
big fan of uh of passing legislation
 
07:10:06.750 --> 07:10:06.760 align:start position:0%
purely for the purpose of of uh as
 
07:10:08.990 --> 07:10:09.000 align:start position:0%
articulated to challenge the commas
 
07:10:11.628 --> 07:10:11.638 align:start position:0%
clause or anything else so um I'm going
 
07:10:17.110 --> 07:10:17.120 align:start position:0%
to I think I'm going to vote um against
 
07:10:17.120 --> 07:10:17.948 align:start position:0%
to I think I'm going to vote um against
this

07:10:17.948 --> 07:10:17.958 align:start position:0%
this
 
07:10:20.948 --> 07:10:20.958 align:start position:0%
proposition thank you um yeah I I tend
 
07:10:22.510 --> 07:10:22.520 align:start position:0%
to agree but then I thought you know how
 
07:10:23.910 --> 07:10:23.920 align:start position:0%
else do you get him to take a case if
 
07:10:27.468 --> 07:10:27.478 align:start position:0%
you don't make one so um see no further
 
07:10:28.750 --> 07:10:28.760 align:start position:0%

07:12:17.750 --> 07:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
whole stack of them
 
07:12:24.990 --> 07:12:25.000 align:start position:0%
 
07:12:29.350 --> 07:12:29.360 align:start position:0%
please so I'll speak to the um the bill
 
07:12:31.548 --> 07:12:31.558 align:start position:0%
and the amendment the bills we passed
 
07:12:34.590 --> 07:12:34.600 align:start position:0%
this bill last year it seeks to um
 
07:12:36.750 --> 07:12:36.760 align:start position:0%
return the property to people in in a
 
07:12:38.230 --> 07:12:38.240 align:start position:0%
quicker fashion than they're already
 
07:12:39.708 --> 07:12:39.718 align:start position:0%
having to go through some people we
 
07:12:41.750 --> 07:12:41.760 align:start position:0%
heard wait months and spend thousands to
 
07:12:44.110 --> 07:12:44.120 align:start position:0%
get their own property back because of
 
07:12:46.708 --> 07:12:46.718 align:start position:0%
the way it's set up so this would seek
 
07:12:49.628 --> 07:12:49.638 align:start position:0%
to speed that process up the amendment
 
07:12:53.548 --> 07:12:53.558 align:start position:0%
that was brought um it simply says upon
 
07:12:55.628 --> 07:12:55.638 align:start position:0%
receipt of a proceed response from the
 
07:12:57.350 --> 07:12:57.360 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety Court shall
 
07:12:59.788 --> 07:12:59.798 align:start position:0%
immediately issue in order to return
 
07:13:01.430 --> 07:13:01.440 align:start position:0%
property now there was discussion two
 
07:13:02.910 --> 07:13:02.920 align:start position:0%
days three days I didn't want to get
 
07:13:05.670 --> 07:13:05.680 align:start position:0%
into it because the courts set their own
 
07:13:08.070 --> 07:13:08.080 align:start position:0%
schedule they can determine immediately
 
07:13:09.590 --> 07:13:09.600 align:start position:0%
um how they want hopefully it means
 
07:13:11.110 --> 07:13:11.120 align:start position:0%
they'll do it as soon as they possibly
 
07:13:14.070 --> 07:13:14.080 align:start position:0%
can and they will mail a certified copy
 
07:13:15.868 --> 07:13:15.878 align:start position:0%
or a copy to the police department and
 
07:13:17.468 --> 07:13:17.478 align:start position:0%
they'll call the petitioner and say
 
07:13:18.910 --> 07:13:18.920 align:start position:0%
there's a copy available here at the
 
07:13:20.788 --> 07:13:20.798 align:start position:0%
court if you want to come get it if they
 
07:13:22.628 --> 07:13:22.638 align:start position:0%
want to come get it and drive down and
 
07:13:24.190 --> 07:13:24.200 align:start position:0%
get their stuff that day with a
 
07:13:26.868 --> 07:13:26.878 align:start position:0%
certified copy from the court they can
 
07:13:28.150 --> 07:13:28.160 align:start position:0%
or they can wait for it to come into
 
07:13:30.310 --> 07:13:30.320 align:start position:0%
mail it just gives them an option to get
 
07:13:31.868 --> 07:13:31.878 align:start position:0%
it faster
 
07:13:34.030 --> 07:13:34.040 align:start position:0%
um and that's really
 
07:13:42.150 --> 07:13:42.160 align:start position:0%
 
07:13:44.590 --> 07:13:44.600 align:start position:0%

07:13:46.590 --> 07:13:46.600 align:start position:0%
