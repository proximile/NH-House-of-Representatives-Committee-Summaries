under the code of judicial conduct SB 27
 
00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 align:start position:0%
would allow that form to satisfy the

requirements of RSA 15a as well this
 
00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 align:start position:0%

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 align:start position:0%
welcome chat I remember when I was still
 
00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 align:start position:0%
on the court there were I had been
 
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 align:start position:0%
appointed to some
 
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:21.180 align:start position:0%
either executive and or legislative
 
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 align:start position:0%
committees or commissions of one kind or
 
00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:25.979 align:start position:0%
another and it was I always filed
 
00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 align:start position:0%
multiple forms because it wasn't clear
 
00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 align:start position:0%
whether the judicial form was enough and
 
00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:32.699 align:start position:0%

foreign

00:07:24.529 --> 00:07:24.539 align:start position:0%
 
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
Mr chairman members of the committee my
 
00:07:27.770 --> 00:07:27.780 align:start position:0%
name is Richard head I'm the government
 
00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:29.639 align:start position:0%
Affairs coordinator for the judicial
 
00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:31.860 align:start position:0%
branch this was a bill that we had
 
00:07:34.249 --> 00:07:34.259 align:start position:0%
requested be put in
 
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 align:start position:0%
um and as Mr bossy said it's basically
 
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
to avoid some current confusion that
 
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:42.660 align:start position:0%
exists in the statute the um there's as
 
00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:44.160 align:start position:0%
the chairman mentioned there's really
 
00:07:46.309 --> 00:07:46.319 align:start position:0%
only one very very limited circumstance
 
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:48.900 align:start position:0%
under current law where it can be where
 
00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:52.319 align:start position:0%
probably judges would have to submit a
 
00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:54.720 align:start position:0%
financial disclosure under the 15a
 
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:57.360 align:start position:0%
executive branch disclosure form and
 
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:00.240 align:start position:0%
that's in the in the instance in which a
 
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940 align:start position:0%
judge is appointed by the governor or
 
00:08:05.629 --> 00:08:05.639 align:start position:0%
the speaker or the Senate President to a
 
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.160 align:start position:0%
board or commission and that may be the
 
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:10.560 align:start position:0%
only time it gets triggered the problem
 
00:08:12.110 --> 00:08:12.120 align:start position:0%
has been
 
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.510 align:start position:0%
has been
um

00:08:13.510 --> 00:08:13.520 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:08:16.309 --> 00:08:16.319 align:start position:0%
anytime we get a new judge they get
 
00:08:19.369 --> 00:08:19.379 align:start position:0%
forms under this because the executive
 
00:08:21.469 --> 00:08:21.479 align:start position:0%
Council thinks well somebody's been
 
00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:22.860 align:start position:0%
appointed through governor and Council
 
00:08:24.589 --> 00:08:24.599 align:start position:0%
so they need to file one of these forms
 
00:08:26.629 --> 00:08:26.639 align:start position:0%
and the Secretary of State keeps sending
 
00:08:29.089 --> 00:08:29.099 align:start position:0%
out these forms and
 
00:08:30.950 --> 00:08:30.960 align:start position:0%
um and the judges get confused some file
 
00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:34.860 align:start position:0%
them some don't and it becomes somewhat
 
00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:37.140 align:start position:0%
um confusing just as to what form gets
 
00:08:39.889 --> 00:08:39.899 align:start position:0%
filed the the language that we proposed
 
00:08:42.409 --> 00:08:42.419 align:start position:0%
is essentially the same as applies to
 
00:08:44.269 --> 00:08:44.279 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch So currently
 
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:46.140 align:start position:0%
under under that same section that we're
 
00:08:48.710 --> 00:08:48.720 align:start position:0%
amending with this bill the statue says
 
00:08:50.389 --> 00:08:50.399 align:start position:0%
the filing of a financial disclosure
 
00:08:51.949 --> 00:08:51.959 align:start position:0%
formed by an elected member of the House
 
00:08:54.170 --> 00:08:54.180 align:start position:0%
of Representatives or Senate pursuant to
 
00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:56.399 align:start position:0%
14 B8 shall satisfy the requirements for
 
00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:57.839 align:start position:0%
filing a statement of financial interest
 
00:08:59.990 --> 00:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
pursuant to this chapter so essentially
 
00:09:01.850 --> 00:09:01.860 align:start position:0%
we're doing for the judicial branch what
 
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:04.260 align:start position:0%
applies to the legislative branch which
 
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:07.740 align:start position:0%
is the which is the filing that judges
 
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.320 align:start position:0%
do Under the judicial conduct rules for
 
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:12.600 align:start position:0%
financial disclosure and then in the
 
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.140 align:start position:0%
limited instance and in which a 15a
 
00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:18.360 align:start position:0%
disclosure gets triggered the statue
 
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:21.120 align:start position:0%
would say that the judicial conduct form
 
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:24.720 align:start position:0%
would apply with regard to the question
 
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.210 align:start position:0%
would apply with regard to the question
about

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:26.220 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:27.660 align:start position:0%
um about whether there's anything
 
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:30.540 align:start position:0%
missing the judicial conduct uh
 
00:09:34.009 --> 00:09:34.019 align:start position:0%
form is actually more comprehensive I do
 
00:09:35.570 --> 00:09:35.580 align:start position:0%
have one copy I'm happy to circulate
 
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.040 align:start position:0%
around or I can email whatever be the
 
00:09:41.449 --> 00:09:41.459 align:start position:0%
preference came out of a order from the
 
00:09:44.210 --> 00:09:44.220 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court and it's just a set form
 
00:09:45.889 --> 00:09:45.899 align:start position:0%
but it's it's actually probably more
 
00:09:49.370 --> 00:09:49.380 align:start position:0%
inclusive than the 15a disclosure is
 
00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:53.700 align:start position:0%
um so basically it the bill is designed
 
00:09:56.389 --> 00:09:56.399 align:start position:0%
simply to avoid confusion make it clear
 
00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959 align:start position:0%
to the executive Council and to the
 
00:10:00.889 --> 00:10:00.899 align:start position:0%
Secretary of State's office that that
 
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:02.640 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch similar to the
 
00:10:05.090 --> 00:10:05.100 align:start position:0%
legislative branch has a form and that
 
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:07.880 align:start position:0%
form applies when 15a gets triggered
 
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:10.380 align:start position:0%
with that'd be happy to answer any
 
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:12.360 align:start position:0%
questions thank you yes representative
 
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:13.730 align:start position:0%
questions thank you yes representative
Smith

00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:13.740 align:start position:0%
Smith
 
00:10:18.889 --> 00:10:18.899 align:start position:0%
 
00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:21.180 align:start position:0%
question you have the form and we don't
 
00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:25.140 align:start position:0%
so you have the advantage can you help
 
00:10:29.269 --> 00:10:29.279 align:start position:0%
us by telling us what
 
00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
isn't included what in other words what
 
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:34.620 align:start position:0%
the Supreme Court thought was important
 
00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:37.800 align:start position:0%
for judges to disclose that the
 
00:10:40.070 --> 00:10:40.080 align:start position:0%
legislature doesn't think is important
 
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:42.660 align:start position:0%
for legislators to disclose
 
00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:43.560 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question
 
00:10:45.829 --> 00:10:45.839 align:start position:0%
unfortunately I didn't bring the 15a
 
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:49.200 align:start position:0%
form I brought the the judicial form and
 
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:50.940 align:start position:0%
just very quickly
 
00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:54.540 align:start position:0%
um it talks about entities you've
 
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.000 align:start position:0%
received reimbursement from or a waiver
 
00:10:59.350 --> 00:10:59.360 align:start position:0%
of fees during the reporting period
 
00:11:02.030 --> 00:11:02.040 align:start position:0%
gifts loans be quests or anything of
 
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:04.380 align:start position:0%
value including invitations to you your
 
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:06.720 align:start position:0%
spouse or domestic partner
 
00:11:09.430 --> 00:11:09.440 align:start position:0%
um at an event without charge
 
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:12.240 align:start position:0%
the gifts loans bequest and other things
 
00:11:14.449 --> 00:11:14.459 align:start position:0%
of value you receive during the
 
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:16.740 align:start position:0%
reporting period
 
00:11:19.430 --> 00:11:19.440 align:start position:0%
um disclosure of sources of income in
 
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:21.600 align:start position:0%
excess of five thousand dollars
 
00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:24.420 align:start position:0%
a name of any creditors that
 
00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.009 align:start position:0%
a name of any creditors that
um

00:11:25.009 --> 00:11:25.019 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:26.940 align:start position:0%
to whom you owe more than five thousand
 
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:29.300 align:start position:0%
dollars disclosure
 
00:11:33.050 --> 00:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
of disclosure the city or town and state
 
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
in particular you spending real estate
 
00:11:37.610 --> 00:11:37.620 align:start position:0%
other than your residence
 
00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:38.509 align:start position:0%
other than your residence
um

00:11:38.509 --> 00:11:38.519 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:40.320 align:start position:0%
which had a fair market value in excess
 
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480 align:start position:0%
of twenty five hundred dollars and
 
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:45.420 align:start position:0%
business entities in which the judges a
 
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:47.100 align:start position:0%
trustee beneficiary a trust director
 
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:51.000 align:start position:0%
officer owner limited partner so on Etc
 
00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.310 align:start position:0%
officer owner limited partner so on Etc
um

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:11:55.009 --> 00:11:55.019 align:start position:0%
and charitable organizations for which
 
00:11:56.930 --> 00:11:56.940 align:start position:0%
they serve on a board are the other
 
00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:00.060 align:start position:0%
questions but I've not I did a while ago
 
00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:01.500 align:start position:0%
I haven't recently compared it to the
 
00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:03.839 align:start position:0%
15a disclosure
 
00:12:07.069 --> 00:12:07.079 align:start position:0%
thank you um Mr chair the thought occurs
 
00:12:10.449 --> 00:12:10.459 align:start position:0%
to me and perhaps I'm totally off base
 
00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:13.620 align:start position:0%
I'm wondering if we might want to
 
00:12:16.329 --> 00:12:16.339 align:start position:0%
consider having the legislature
 
00:12:20.449 --> 00:12:20.459 align:start position:0%
adopt the current Court requirements
 
00:12:23.389 --> 00:12:23.399 align:start position:0%
rather than vice versa if in fact the
 
00:12:26.449 --> 00:12:26.459 align:start position:0%
court requirements are more
 
00:12:26.459 --> 00:12:27.350 align:start position:0%
court requirements are more
um

00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:27.360 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:29.990 align:start position:0%
um
inclusive

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:30.000 align:start position:0%
inclusive
 
00:12:33.769 --> 00:12:33.779 align:start position:0%
right uh I I'm I'm certainly open to
 
00:12:34.910 --> 00:12:34.920 align:start position:0%
thinking about I mean that may be
 
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:36.300 align:start position:0%
something we would consider for a bill
 
00:12:37.790 --> 00:12:37.800 align:start position:0%
for next year or something like that is
 
00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:39.540 align:start position:0%
that what you're thinking well
 
00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:41.880 align:start position:0%
um in fact we happen to have a bill
 
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:45.360 align:start position:0%
before us that
 
00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:46.550 align:start position:0%
before us that
um

00:12:46.550 --> 00:12:46.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:12:49.250 --> 00:12:49.260 align:start position:0%
you know we might you know but yes
 
00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:52.680 align:start position:0%
you're right it might be neater to do it
 
00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:56.160 align:start position:0%
another but it sounds to me that there's
 
00:12:58.310 --> 00:12:58.320 align:start position:0%
some very good points
 
00:13:01.490 --> 00:13:01.500 align:start position:0%
um that the the court
 
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:04.860 align:start position:0%
um identified and uh
 
00:13:07.490 --> 00:13:07.500 align:start position:0%
yeah you know the only I I I'm I'm
 
00:13:09.829 --> 00:13:09.839 align:start position:0%
certainly not opposed to to at least
 
00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160 align:start position:0%
considering it the only thing I guess
 
00:13:12.970 --> 00:13:12.980 align:start position:0%
that would raise
 
00:13:17.329 --> 00:13:17.339 align:start position:0%
some question for me is that unlike the
 
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:19.440 align:start position:0%
situation with judges what would be the
 
00:13:21.530 --> 00:13:21.540 align:start position:0%
interaction of
 
00:13:23.990 --> 00:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
of some of the disclosures called for
 
00:13:26.509 --> 00:13:26.519 align:start position:0%
there with the campaign Finance
 
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:28.320 align:start position:0%
disclosures I mean is there in other
 
00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:30.980 align:start position:0%
words can't judges are not getting
 
00:13:34.790 --> 00:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
contributions for a campaign so to speak
 
00:13:37.730 --> 00:13:37.740 align:start position:0%
whereas Representatives might be and
 
00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:39.720 align:start position:0%
that you know and then what all I'm
 
00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:40.920 align:start position:0%
saying is that might be something we
 
00:13:42.170 --> 00:13:42.180 align:start position:0%
have to really think carefully about
 
00:13:45.470 --> 00:13:45.480 align:start position:0%
except that nothing to my knowledge I
 
00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:47.040 align:start position:0%
don't have the form in front of me and
 
00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:49.740 align:start position:0%
perhaps our wonderful researcher can
 
00:13:52.069 --> 00:13:52.079 align:start position:0%
tell me I do not believe there is
 
00:13:55.970 --> 00:13:55.980 align:start position:0%
anything in our disclosure form that has
 
00:13:59.269 --> 00:13:59.279 align:start position:0%
to do with campaign I agree expenditures
 
00:14:02.389 --> 00:14:02.399 align:start position:0%
that is entirely separate I don't know
 
00:14:07.009 --> 00:14:07.019 align:start position:0%
because I don't believe in in I don't
 
00:14:09.230 --> 00:14:09.240 align:start position:0%
accept any campaign contributions so I'm
 
00:14:11.269 --> 00:14:11.279 align:start position:0%
not familiar with that whole area that's
 
00:14:13.190 --> 00:14:13.200 align:start position:0%
another issue that has to do with one
 
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:15.300 align:start position:0%
more way that I'm crazy
 
00:14:16.910 --> 00:14:16.920 align:start position:0%
um but
 
00:14:20.449 --> 00:14:20.459 align:start position:0%
um so that's not an issue it is
 
00:14:20.459 --> 00:14:21.790 align:start position:0%
um so that's not an issue it is
conceivable

00:14:21.790 --> 00:14:21.800 align:start position:0%
conceivable
 
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:24.300 align:start position:0%
that there might be other information
 
00:14:27.650 --> 00:14:27.660 align:start position:0%
that isn't particularly relevant
 
00:14:29.690 --> 00:14:29.700 align:start position:0%
um you might see my my point was though
 
00:14:32.090 --> 00:14:32.100 align:start position:0%
that some of the I think some I agree
 
00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:35.760 align:start position:0%
that our disclosure forms don't call for
 
00:14:38.210 --> 00:14:38.220 align:start position:0%
anything about campaign Finance but as
 
00:14:40.310 --> 00:14:40.320 align:start position:0%
Mr head was reading off some of the
 
00:14:43.069 --> 00:14:43.079 align:start position:0%
disclosures there
 
00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:45.000 align:start position:0%
um you know for example did you what
 
00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:46.380 align:start position:0%
wasn't one of the questions did you
 
00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:49.380 align:start position:0%
receive uh money of five thousand
 
00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:51.959 align:start position:0%
dollars or more or something like that
 
00:14:54.769 --> 00:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
um would that you know could that maybe
 
00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:56.820 align:start position:0%
not I would think it might be unlikely
 
00:14:58.970 --> 00:14:58.980 align:start position:0%
for a representative but maybe in a
 
00:15:01.850 --> 00:15:01.860 align:start position:0%
Senatorial race the state Senatorial
 
00:15:03.350 --> 00:15:03.360 align:start position:0%
race they would be I don't know
 
00:15:05.389 --> 00:15:05.399 align:start position:0%
absolutely just don't do it and I I
 
00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:07.500 align:start position:0%
don't know that the form the legislative
 
00:15:09.710 --> 00:15:09.720 align:start position:0%
form itself is statutory I think that
 
00:15:12.470 --> 00:15:12.480 align:start position:0%
that the form may be created you have an
 
00:15:14.030 --> 00:15:14.040 align:start position:0%
obligation under the statute but I don't
 
00:15:16.129 --> 00:15:16.139 align:start position:0%
think the content of the statute or the
 
00:15:18.769 --> 00:15:18.779 align:start position:0%
rule of the form I mean is it I think is
 
00:15:20.870 --> 00:15:20.880 align:start position:0%
laid out in the statute so you may
 
00:15:23.810 --> 00:15:23.820 align:start position:0%
be able to amend the the disclosure form
 
00:15:25.610 --> 00:15:25.620 align:start position:0%
through a rulemaking or whatever that
 
00:15:29.389 --> 00:15:29.399 align:start position:0%
process was I don't want to believe it
 
00:15:32.269 --> 00:15:32.279 align:start position:0%
 
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:33.540 align:start position:0%
and all Could you
 
00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
um if it if it's not too much trouble if
 
00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:38.160 align:start position:0%
you could uh arrange for us to have
 
00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.710 align:start position:0%
you could uh arrange for us to have
copies

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:39.720 align:start position:0%
copies
 
00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:42.180 align:start position:0%
um I I would be very interested in
 
00:15:44.569 --> 00:15:44.579 align:start position:0%
reading it or tell us how we can get
 
00:15:46.490 --> 00:15:46.500 align:start position:0%
copied so I I'd be happy to I'll email
 
00:15:48.769 --> 00:15:48.779 align:start position:0%
the committee a copy of the of the
 
00:15:50.210 --> 00:15:50.220 align:start position:0%
current form with the with the order
 
00:15:52.610 --> 00:15:52.620 align:start position:0%
that requires it and I'll be happy to
 
00:15:54.410 --> 00:15:54.420 align:start position:0%
circulate the copy I have today also
 
00:15:56.449 --> 00:15:56.459 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr head that would
 
00:15:57.829 --> 00:15:57.839 align:start position:0%
be great that would be that'd be great
 
00:15:59.949 --> 00:15:59.959 align:start position:0%
and as I say I'm not I'm certainly not
 
00:16:02.269 --> 00:16:02.279 align:start position:0%
opposed to thinking about it further I'm
 
00:16:04.189 --> 00:16:04.199 align:start position:0%
just wondering if it might be better to
 
00:16:07.689 --> 00:16:07.699 align:start position:0%
you know to do it to do it next year yes
 
00:16:09.829 --> 00:16:09.839 align:start position:0%
Wallace thank you Mr chairman thanks for
 
00:16:11.389 --> 00:16:11.399 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:15.600 align:start position:0%
um is that would this change or adoption
 
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:18.600 align:start position:0%
of this statute uh subject the judges to
 
00:16:20.509 --> 00:16:20.519 align:start position:0%
the same penalties for not for failure
 
00:16:22.790 --> 00:16:22.800 align:start position:0%
to comply with the statute of filling
 
00:16:25.189 --> 00:16:25.199 align:start position:0%
out the disclosure legislators if we
 
00:16:26.269 --> 00:16:26.279 align:start position:0%
don't do this we're subject to
 
00:16:28.129 --> 00:16:28.139 align:start position:0%
misdemeanor charges
 
00:16:30.170 --> 00:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
um just I don't see it in the bill and
 
00:16:31.670 --> 00:16:31.680 align:start position:0%
just the question right so so thank you
 
00:16:34.189 --> 00:16:34.199 align:start position:0%
for the the question all this bill does
 
00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:36.480 align:start position:0%
this allows the forms to be swapped it
 
00:16:37.970 --> 00:16:37.980 align:start position:0%
doesn't change any other provision of
 
00:16:39.290 --> 00:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:16:42.769 --> 00:16:42.779 align:start position:0%
um and the form itself is required under
 
00:16:45.769 --> 00:16:45.779 align:start position:0%
the judicial conduct rules so failure to
 
00:16:49.249 --> 00:16:49.259 align:start position:0%
submit it would potentially lead to a
 
00:16:51.050 --> 00:16:51.060 align:start position:0%
violation of the judicial conduct rules
 
00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:54.120 align:start position:0%
but but this bill and this change all it
 
00:16:56.449 --> 00:16:56.459 align:start position:0%
does is swap forms doesn't modify any of
 
00:16:58.009 --> 00:16:58.019 align:start position:0%
the other obligations under the under
 
00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:00.180 align:start position:0%
the statute
 
00:17:02.689 --> 00:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes
 
00:17:02.699 --> 00:17:03.850 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness yes
representative

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:03.860 align:start position:0%
representative
 
00:17:06.590 --> 00:17:06.600 align:start position:0%
thank you thank you Mr head
 
00:17:09.230 --> 00:17:09.240 align:start position:0%
um when I read through 15a I didn't
 
00:17:13.130 --> 00:17:13.140 align:start position:0%
clearly see how judges were subject to
 
00:17:15.829 --> 00:17:15.839 align:start position:0%
15a so I was seeking clarification on
 
00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:16.919 align:start position:0%
that point
 
00:17:18.169 --> 00:17:18.179 align:start position:0%
um uh thank you for the question and
 
00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:19.679 align:start position:0%
it's a fair question because it's not
 
00:17:19.679 --> 00:17:20.689 align:start position:0%
it's a fair question because it's not
clear

00:17:20.689 --> 00:17:20.699 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:17:23.390 --> 00:17:23.400 align:start position:0%
um it notwithstanding the fact judges
 
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:26.360 align:start position:0%
keep getting the form under 15a
 
00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:29.580 align:start position:0%
frequently you know for example when
 
00:17:33.669 --> 00:17:33.679 align:start position:0%
they are uh nominated and appointed by
 
00:17:36.230 --> 00:17:36.240 align:start position:0%
governor and Council and go through the
 
00:17:38.210 --> 00:17:38.220 align:start position:0%
governor and Council process that
 
00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:40.260 align:start position:0%
doesn't trigger it for judges it does
 
00:17:42.289 --> 00:17:42.299 align:start position:0%
for Commissioners for example
 
00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:44.640 align:start position:0%
but there's just there's just appears to
 
00:17:46.130 --> 00:17:46.140 align:start position:0%
be confusion on the part of those who
 
00:17:48.590 --> 00:17:48.600 align:start position:0%
issue the 15a forms and they keep coming
 
00:17:50.990 --> 00:17:51.000 align:start position:0%
in the only one that
 
00:17:54.070 --> 00:17:54.080 align:start position:0%
potentially could apply to a judge is
 
00:17:58.850 --> 00:17:58.860 align:start position:0%
15a3 paragraph Roman 2 which talks about
 
00:18:01.310 --> 00:18:01.320 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry not 50 I'm my bad uh wrong
 
00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:02.390 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry not 50 I'm my bad uh wrong
section

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:02.400 align:start position:0%
section
 
00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.470 align:start position:0%
section
um

00:18:03.470 --> 00:18:03.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:18:07.610 --> 00:18:07.620 align:start position:0%
C so paragraph one C every person
 
00:18:09.350 --> 00:18:09.360 align:start position:0%
appointed by the governor governor and
 
00:18:10.850 --> 00:18:10.860 align:start position:0%
council president of the senate or
 
00:18:12.350 --> 00:18:12.360 align:start position:0%
Speaker of the House of Representatives
 
00:18:14.150 --> 00:18:14.160 align:start position:0%
to any board commission committee board
 
00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:16.380 align:start position:0%
of directors Authority or equivalence
 
00:18:18.350 --> 00:18:18.360 align:start position:0%
data entity whether regulatory advisory
 
00:18:20.210 --> 00:18:20.220 align:start position:0%
administrative in nature would be
 
00:18:22.310 --> 00:18:22.320 align:start position:0%
required to fill one out so in theory if
 
00:18:24.950 --> 00:18:24.960 align:start position:0%
a judge goes to that process the problem
 
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:27.900 align:start position:0%
is they just keep getting forms all the
 
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:28.980 align:start position:0%
time without knowing what to do with
 
00:18:32.029 --> 00:18:32.039 align:start position:0%
them and then they ask and it gets
 
00:18:33.289 --> 00:18:33.299 align:start position:0%
confusing please
 
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:34.940 align:start position:0%
what about
 
00:18:37.549 --> 00:18:37.559 align:start position:0%
amending the statute so that it's clear
 
00:18:40.370 --> 00:18:40.380 align:start position:0%
that judges
 
00:18:44.150 --> 00:18:44.160 align:start position:0%
um appointed to judicial positions per
 
00:18:47.630 --> 00:18:47.640 align:start position:0%
se because even when you read 15 the
 
00:18:50.810 --> 00:18:50.820 align:start position:0%
subparagraph C to me if I read this
 
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:53.460 align:start position:0%
yesterday it wasn't at all clear to me
 
00:18:55.370 --> 00:18:55.380 align:start position:0%
that this I'm not sure it does either
 
00:18:58.010 --> 00:18:58.020 align:start position:0%
but yeah what about if it were clarified
 
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:00.360 align:start position:0%
so that judges appointed to judicial
 
00:19:05.029 --> 00:19:05.039 align:start position:0%
positions are not applicable under 15a
 
00:19:06.950 --> 00:19:06.960 align:start position:0%
so you could do that the you know we
 
00:19:10.130 --> 00:19:10.140 align:start position:0%
figured given sort of the the branch
 
00:19:12.049 --> 00:19:12.059 align:start position:0%
structure of this bill we would just
 
00:19:14.029 --> 00:19:14.039 align:start position:0%
follow the the structure that applies to
 
00:19:16.070 --> 00:19:16.080 align:start position:0%
the legislative branch so that we're not
 
00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:18.080 align:start position:0%
treated any differently per se
 
00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:21.780 align:start position:0%
but that you know we we would as a
 
00:19:23.990 --> 00:19:24.000 align:start position:0%
judicial branch be treated the similar
 
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:26.160 align:start position:0%
as the legislative branch on what is
 
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
really an executive branch form
 
00:19:32.029 --> 00:19:32.039 align:start position:0%
um but but since since it was worth
 
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:33.900 align:start position:0%
putting in the legislative language we
 
00:19:35.630 --> 00:19:35.640 align:start position:0%
thought okay would we would just do it
 
00:19:37.430 --> 00:19:37.440 align:start position:0%
that way it seemed like the simplest way
 
00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:40.860 align:start position:0%
 
00:19:43.610 --> 00:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr head
 
00:19:45.650 --> 00:19:45.660 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr head thank you
 
00:20:01.669 --> 00:20:01.679 align:start position:0%
 
00:20:04.130 --> 00:20:04.140 align:start position:0%
I'm going to close the hearing on SB 27
 
00:33:57.470 --> 00:33:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.269 align:start position:0%
 
okay

00:33:59.269 --> 00:33:59.279 align:start position:0%
okay
 
00:34:02.149 --> 00:34:02.159 align:start position:0%
all right uh I'm gonna uh it's now past
 
00:34:03.769 --> 00:34:03.779 align:start position:0%
10 30. I'm gonna open the hearing on
 
00:34:07.850 --> 00:34:07.860 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 59 and uh recognize Senator
 
00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040 align:start position:0%
gray uh the prime sponsor to testify
 
00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:11.990 align:start position:0%
gray uh the prime sponsor to testify
first

00:34:11.990 --> 00:34:12.000 align:start position:0%
first
 
00:34:14.389 --> 00:34:14.399 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh my name is
 
00:34:17.270 --> 00:34:17.280 align:start position:0%
James Gray I'm a senator representing
 
00:34:19.369 --> 00:34:19.379 align:start position:0%
District Six which starts up in Alton
 
00:34:21.530 --> 00:34:21.540 align:start position:0%
gimmelton goes down Route 11 to
 
00:34:21.540 --> 00:34:22.970 align:start position:0%
gimmelton goes down Route 11 to
Rochester

00:34:22.970 --> 00:34:22.980 align:start position:0%
Rochester
 
00:34:22.980 --> 00:34:24.369 align:start position:0%
Rochester
um

00:34:24.369 --> 00:34:24.379 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:34:27.050 --> 00:34:27.060 align:start position:0%
if we didn't have to correct things that
 
00:34:29.389 --> 00:34:29.399 align:start position:0%
we did in the past we wouldn't be here
 
00:34:33.889 --> 00:34:33.899 align:start position:0%
very long you know and so this bill is
 
00:34:37.129 --> 00:34:37.139 align:start position:0%
in requested the department right now if
 
00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:39.720 align:start position:0%
you look at line eight of the bill uh
 
00:34:41.450 --> 00:34:41.460 align:start position:0%
what has struck out is at the state
 
00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:44.220 align:start position:0%
house which the requirement is that the
 
00:34:46.250 --> 00:34:46.260 align:start position:0%
meeting be at the State House of course
 
00:34:49.369 --> 00:34:49.379 align:start position:0%
with them being right here next door you
 
00:34:51.109 --> 00:34:51.119 align:start position:0%
know that hasn't been too awfully bad
 
00:34:54.409 --> 00:34:54.419 align:start position:0%
but now I'm told they're going to move
 
00:34:58.010 --> 00:34:58.020 align:start position:0%
whether they like it or not so again the
 
00:34:59.690 --> 00:34:59.700 align:start position:0%
department will be able to speak more
 
00:35:02.870 --> 00:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
about this but we just want to take out
 
00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:06.240 align:start position:0%
those those words to uh to make sure
 
00:35:08.750 --> 00:35:08.760 align:start position:0%
that any individual that's having a
 
00:35:10.970 --> 00:35:10.980 align:start position:0%
hearing uh they can do it at the new
 
00:35:12.290 --> 00:35:12.300 align:start position:0%
building they can do it at the old
 
00:35:14.030 --> 00:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
building they can do it here at the
 
00:35:17.210 --> 00:35:17.220 align:start position:0%
state house wherever it's convenient so
 
00:35:20.510 --> 00:35:20.520 align:start position:0%
on sure if there's no questions any
 
00:35:22.849 --> 00:35:22.859 align:start position:0%
questions representative Alexander thank
 
00:35:24.770 --> 00:35:24.780 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair thank you Senator
 
00:35:27.410 --> 00:35:27.420 align:start position:0%
um is there it seems to me like this is
 
00:35:29.150 --> 00:35:29.160 align:start position:0%
removing the requirement for a physical
 
00:35:31.670 --> 00:35:31.680 align:start position:0%
location as well correct
 
00:35:35.089 --> 00:35:35.099 align:start position:0%
uh I didn't read it as that
 
00:35:38.329 --> 00:35:38.339 align:start position:0%
um but it doesn't specify a physical
 
00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:40.680 align:start position:0%
location well it in the current statute
 
00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:42.420 align:start position:0%
it requires a physical location at the
 
00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:44.520 align:start position:0%
state house right so would you be a
 
00:35:46.310 --> 00:35:46.320 align:start position:0%
matter of that the meeting the
 
00:35:49.030 --> 00:35:49.040 align:start position:0%
department would be the one that uh
 
00:35:52.430 --> 00:35:52.440 align:start position:0%
certainly you know an accommodation uh
 
00:35:55.730 --> 00:35:55.740 align:start position:0%
because of a disability or something uh
 
00:35:58.609 --> 00:35:58.619 align:start position:0%
similar to that you know the department
 
00:36:01.550 --> 00:36:01.560 align:start position:0%
can speak too much better than I okay
 
00:36:03.650 --> 00:36:03.660 align:start position:0%
um you know whether or not there's a
 
00:36:06.290 --> 00:36:06.300 align:start position:0%
need for an actual meeting you know if
 
00:36:08.510 --> 00:36:08.520 align:start position:0%
we can do it via Zoom or other things
 
00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:11.280 align:start position:0%
mean might not be an official meeting
 
00:36:14.510 --> 00:36:14.520 align:start position:0%
but again the department is much more
 
00:36:17.349 --> 00:36:17.359 align:start position:0%
suited for that conversation than I
 
00:36:20.630 --> 00:36:20.640 align:start position:0%
any other questions for Senator gray yes
 
00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton
 
00:36:25.430 --> 00:36:25.440 align:start position:0%
yes thank you for taking my question the
 
00:36:28.010 --> 00:36:28.020 align:start position:0%
removal of the State House is is the
 
00:36:29.329 --> 00:36:29.339 align:start position:0%
State House
 
00:36:29.339 --> 00:36:30.890 align:start position:0%
State House
strictly

00:36:30.890 --> 00:36:30.900 align:start position:0%
strictly
 
00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:34.020 align:start position:0%
the state house or does that include the
 
00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.130 align:start position:0%
the state house or does that include the
LOB

00:36:37.130 --> 00:36:37.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:36:40.250 --> 00:36:40.260 align:start position:0%
and is that one of the reasons why
 
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:43.140 align:start position:0%
you want to have some variability on the
 
00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:44.690 align:start position:0%
you want to have some variability on the
location

00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:44.700 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:47.940 align:start position:0%
it sounds to me like that would be a
 
00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:50.700 align:start position:0%
clarifying thing that right now it does
 
00:36:52.670 --> 00:36:52.680 align:start position:0%
not specify that you could have it at
 
00:36:55.190 --> 00:36:55.200 align:start position:0%
the lob it does not specify that you
 
00:36:58.490 --> 00:36:58.500 align:start position:0%
could have it at their offices here on
 
00:37:02.150 --> 00:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
Center Street no Capitol street I knew
 
00:37:05.210 --> 00:37:05.220 align:start position:0%
it was one of those but again you know
 
00:37:08.450 --> 00:37:08.460 align:start position:0%
that like I say one of one of the things
 
00:37:10.550 --> 00:37:10.560 align:start position:0%
that we do is we pass a bill one year
 
00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:13.460 align:start position:0%
and then come back and and and tweak it
 
00:37:17.810 --> 00:37:17.820 align:start position:0%
I'm often reminded when I go to the land
 
00:37:17.820 --> 00:37:19.150 align:start position:0%
I'm often reminded when I go to the land
use

00:37:19.150 --> 00:37:19.160 align:start position:0%
use
 
00:37:22.670 --> 00:37:22.680 align:start position:0%
training that they do that there's one
 
00:37:25.490 --> 00:37:25.500 align:start position:0%
individual by the name of Ben Frost who
 
00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:28.140 align:start position:0%
always has a lecture on the laws that we
 
00:37:32.210 --> 00:37:32.220 align:start position:0%
passed in the last several years and I
 
00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:34.200 align:start position:0%
always call it you know what the bill
 
00:37:37.970 --> 00:37:37.980 align:start position:0%
really did that you passed so uh you
 
00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:40.980 align:start position:0%
know that's again this it it has not
 
00:37:43.609 --> 00:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
been a big problem that I know of in in
 
00:37:47.030 --> 00:37:47.040 align:start position:0%
the past but now with the relocation it
 
00:37:49.430 --> 00:37:49.440 align:start position:0%
starts to become a bigger problem so
 
00:37:51.650 --> 00:37:51.660 align:start position:0%
follow up yes
 
00:37:54.890 --> 00:37:54.900 align:start position:0%
so taking the word state house out of
 
00:37:57.470 --> 00:37:57.480 align:start position:0%
there gives us flexibility to have other
 
00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.710 align:start position:0%
there gives us flexibility to have other
locations

00:37:59.710 --> 00:37:59.720 align:start position:0%
locations
 
00:38:03.290 --> 00:38:03.300 align:start position:0%

information that might be responsive to
 
00:39:29.870 --> 00:39:29.880 align:start position:0%
some of the questions that were just
 
00:39:33.170 --> 00:39:33.180 align:start position:0%
asked first of all just by way of
 
00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:36.900 align:start position:0%
 
00:39:38.810 --> 00:39:38.820 align:start position:0%
for many years the courts in the United
 
00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:41.640 align:start position:0%
States recognized the authority of the
 
00:39:44.089 --> 00:39:44.099 align:start position:0%
Attorney General under the common law to
 
00:39:47.810 --> 00:39:47.820 align:start position:0%
represent the Public's interests in chat
 
00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:50.520 align:start position:0%
the protection of charitable assets and
 
00:39:53.210 --> 00:39:53.220 align:start position:0%
in 1943 the New Hampshire legislature
 
00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:55.980 align:start position:0%
became the first state in the nation to
 
00:39:58.089 --> 00:39:58.099 align:start position:0%
codify the attorney general's Authority
 
00:40:01.910 --> 00:40:01.920 align:start position:0%
and establish an office
 
00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:05.460 align:start position:0%
uh solely devoted to the oversight of
 
00:40:07.310 --> 00:40:07.320 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts and that's our office
 
00:40:09.950 --> 00:40:09.960 align:start position:0%
the charitable trust unit our role and
 
00:40:11.810 --> 00:40:11.820 align:start position:0%
responsibility is to protect the
 
00:40:13.370 --> 00:40:13.380 align:start position:0%
Public's interest in charitable
 
00:40:16.430 --> 00:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
organizations and assets devoted to
 
00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:19.140 align:start position:0%
charitable purposes in our state
 
00:40:23.390 --> 00:40:23.400 align:start position:0%
currently we oversee approximately 11
 
00:40:26.390 --> 00:40:26.400 align:start position:0%
000 charitable organizations and trusts
 
00:40:28.150 --> 00:40:28.160 align:start position:0%
registered with our office
 
00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220 align:start position:0%
and they also all re submit annual
 
00:40:35.030 --> 00:40:35.040 align:start position:0%
reports to our office as well
 
00:40:38.450 --> 00:40:38.460 align:start position:0%
the statute that's uh at issue today is
 
00:40:41.510 --> 00:40:41.520 align:start position:0%
RSA 724 which provides the Attorney
 
00:40:43.510 --> 00:40:43.520 align:start position:0%
General with broad
 
00:40:46.190 --> 00:40:46.200 align:start position:0%
authority to investigate charitable
 
00:40:49.430 --> 00:40:49.440 align:start position:0%
trust to ensure that they are complying
 
00:40:51.849 --> 00:40:51.859 align:start position:0%
with New Hampshire law
 
00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:54.900 align:start position:0%
provides that the attorney J general May
 
00:40:56.870 --> 00:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
for purposes of the investigation
 
00:41:01.450 --> 00:41:01.460 align:start position:0%
subpoena persons to uh
 
00:41:04.310 --> 00:41:04.320 align:start position:0%
to testify regarding the charitable
 
00:41:07.310 --> 00:41:07.320 align:start position:0%
trust or charitable organization and the
 
00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:09.900 align:start position:0%
place of such subpoena would the
 
00:41:12.589 --> 00:41:12.599 align:start position:0%
location of the investigation would be
 
00:41:14.870 --> 00:41:14.880 align:start position:0%
at the State House at the time the
 
00:41:16.370 --> 00:41:16.380 align:start position:0%
statute was enacted the Attorney
 
00:41:18.670 --> 00:41:18.680 align:start position:0%
General's office was in the state house
 
00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:21.720 align:start position:0%
that as you know the Attorney General's
 
00:41:24.650 --> 00:41:24.660 align:start position:0%
office has moved since then and the
 
00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:26.460 align:start position:0%
Attorney General's office will move
 
00:41:29.510 --> 00:41:29.520 align:start position:0%
again later this year
 
00:41:33.310 --> 00:41:33.320 align:start position:0%
deleting the location from this statute
 
00:41:39.470 --> 00:41:39.480 align:start position:0%
will be helpful to our office uh in in
 
00:41:42.410 --> 00:41:42.420 align:start position:0%
meaning that we won't have to amend the
 
00:41:45.589 --> 00:41:45.599 align:start position:0%
statute every time we move uh but it
 
00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
also gives us the flexibility to allow
 
00:41:51.710 --> 00:41:51.720 align:start position:0%
an investigation to occur by video
 
00:41:54.410 --> 00:41:54.420 align:start position:0%
conference sometimes many of our
 
00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:56.880 align:start position:0%
Charities are run by volunteer board
 
00:41:59.990 --> 00:42:00.000 align:start position:0%
members and they could be located in New
 
00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:00.730 align:start position:0%
members and they could be located in New
Hampshire

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:00.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire
 
00:42:03.170 --> 00:42:03.180 align:start position:0%
or they could be located out of state
 
00:42:05.050 --> 00:42:05.060 align:start position:0%
they could be located out of the country
 
00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:08.700 align:start position:0%
and having a video conference is more
 
00:42:11.750 --> 00:42:11.760 align:start position:0%
convenient oftentimes for board members
 
00:42:14.870 --> 00:42:14.880 align:start position:0%
so we are very grateful to the sponsors
 
00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:17.760 align:start position:0%
for introducing this legislation and
 
00:42:19.730 --> 00:42:19.740 align:start position:0%
Michael will be sharing a little bit
 
00:42:21.650 --> 00:42:21.660 align:start position:0%
more information that may be responsive
 
00:42:23.630 --> 00:42:23.640 align:start position:0%
to some of your questions
 
00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:26.220 align:start position:0%
uh just very briefly I wanted to respond
 
00:42:27.770 --> 00:42:27.780 align:start position:0%
to what I think I heard was a concern
 
00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:28.790 align:start position:0%
to what I think I heard was a concern
about

00:42:28.790 --> 00:42:28.800 align:start position:0%
about
 
00:42:31.609 --> 00:42:31.619 align:start position:0%
um the lack of a physical location
 
00:42:33.290 --> 00:42:33.300 align:start position:0%
um the the meetings that we're talking
 
00:42:35.630 --> 00:42:35.640 align:start position:0%
about here are not uh 91a public
 
00:42:37.550 --> 00:42:37.560 align:start position:0%
meetings these are our investigations
 
00:42:40.069 --> 00:42:40.079 align:start position:0%
that are not open to the public we have
 
00:42:41.810 --> 00:42:41.820 align:start position:0%
a statute that specifies that our
 
00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:43.320 align:start position:0%
investigative records are not subject to
 
00:42:46.790 --> 00:42:46.800 align:start position:0%
91a so there's no conflict between
 
00:42:48.589 --> 00:42:48.599 align:start position:0%
um this removal of a physical location
 
00:42:50.930 --> 00:42:50.940 align:start position:0%
and 91a which requires a physical
 
00:42:53.230 --> 00:42:53.240 align:start position:0%
location except an emergency situations
 
00:42:56.270 --> 00:42:56.280 align:start position:0%
we only are ever speaking directly to
 
00:42:58.069 --> 00:42:58.079 align:start position:0%
the persons that we're investigating or
 
00:42:59.390 --> 00:42:59.400 align:start position:0%
persons that we're trying to solicit
 
00:43:01.309 --> 00:43:01.319 align:start position:0%
investigative information from it's not
 
00:43:02.270 --> 00:43:02.280 align:start position:0%
something that the public can
 
00:43:04.069 --> 00:43:04.079 align:start position:0%
participate in
 
00:43:07.250 --> 00:43:07.260 align:start position:0%
um and then second there's a the
 
00:43:12.349 --> 00:43:12.359 align:start position:0%
spillerman's RSA 724 RSA 725 also speaks
 
00:43:14.030 --> 00:43:14.040 align:start position:0%
to our investigative power and our
 
00:43:16.250 --> 00:43:16.260 align:start position:0%
subpoena power and it says that we are
 
00:43:17.750 --> 00:43:17.760 align:start position:0%
we can have
 
00:43:19.910 --> 00:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
um people appear at the time and place
 
00:43:22.550 --> 00:43:22.560 align:start position:0%
that we specify so removing the state
 
00:43:25.490 --> 00:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
house from from 24 also resolves a
 
00:43:27.890 --> 00:43:27.900 align:start position:0%
potential inconsistency between 25 and
 
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.250 align:start position:0%
potential inconsistency between 25 and
24.

00:43:31.250 --> 00:43:31.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:34.130 --> 00:43:34.140 align:start position:0%
questions yes representative I'm sorry
 
00:43:35.870 --> 00:43:35.880 align:start position:0%
could you just State your your name for
 
00:43:37.309 --> 00:43:37.319 align:start position:0%
the record please I apologize Michael
 
00:43:38.690 --> 00:43:38.700 align:start position:0%
Haley I'm the assistant director of
 
00:43:41.150 --> 00:43:41.160 align:start position:0%
charitable trusts
 
00:43:50.450 --> 00:43:50.460 align:start position:0%
 
00:43:53.569 --> 00:43:53.579 align:start position:0%
the division is
 
00:43:56.270 --> 00:43:56.280 align:start position:0%
um I believe one of the most important
 
00:43:58.910 --> 00:43:58.920 align:start position:0%
divisions of New Hampshire government
 
00:44:02.150 --> 00:44:02.160 align:start position:0%
and delighted to have you here and see
 
00:44:04.130 --> 00:44:04.140 align:start position:0%
new faces
 
00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:06.109 align:start position:0%
new faces
um

00:44:06.109 --> 00:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:08.880 align:start position:0%
and I thank you for clarifying that you
 
00:44:11.870 --> 00:44:11.880 align:start position:0%
are not talking about any
 
00:44:15.050 --> 00:44:15.060 align:start position:0%
um hearings or get or meetings that
 
00:44:17.990 --> 00:44:18.000 align:start position:0%
would fall under 91a because as you know
 
00:44:20.109 --> 00:44:20.119 align:start position:0%
this legislature has been divided
 
00:44:22.670 --> 00:44:22.680 align:start position:0%
painfully on the subject of whether or
 
00:44:24.109 --> 00:44:24.119 align:start position:0%
not to permit
 
00:44:24.119 --> 00:44:24.710 align:start position:0%
not to permit
um

00:44:24.710 --> 00:44:24.720 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.569 align:start position:0%
um
uh

00:44:26.569 --> 00:44:26.579 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:44:31.910 --> 00:44:31.920 align:start position:0%
uh 91a activities that weren't alive and
 
00:44:32.990 --> 00:44:33.000 align:start position:0%
in person
 
00:44:36.890 --> 00:44:36.900 align:start position:0%
what I want to know is
 
00:44:39.230 --> 00:44:39.240 align:start position:0%
what aren't you saying are there is
 
00:44:41.510 --> 00:44:41.520 align:start position:0%
there any other change or any other
 
00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:44.270 align:start position:0%
there any other change or any other
implication

00:44:44.270 --> 00:44:44.280 align:start position:0%
implication
 
00:44:48.170 --> 00:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
uh as a result of this change that would
 
00:44:52.430 --> 00:44:52.440 align:start position:0%
alter how you are able to function other
 
00:44:55.010 --> 00:44:55.020 align:start position:0%
than just to make it easier in terms of
 
00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.569 align:start position:0%
than just to make it easier in terms of
location

00:44:56.569 --> 00:44:56.579 align:start position:0%
location
 
00:44:57.950 --> 00:44:57.960 align:start position:0%
so what
 
00:45:01.490 --> 00:45:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question the uh the
 
00:45:03.890 --> 00:45:03.900 align:start position:0%
fact is that this just resolves uh
 
00:45:05.809 --> 00:45:05.819 align:start position:0%
something that has been hanging out
 
00:45:09.290 --> 00:45:09.300 align:start position:0%
there for a long time the actually the
 
00:45:11.870 --> 00:45:11.880 align:start position:0%
fact is I didn't really pay attention to
 
00:45:14.750 --> 00:45:14.760 align:start position:0%
this issue until we went through the
 
00:45:17.510 --> 00:45:17.520 align:start position:0%
rule making process we went through the
 
00:45:19.490 --> 00:45:19.500 align:start position:0%
rule making process over the course of
 
00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:21.240 align:start position:0%
the last year and established
 
00:45:23.089 --> 00:45:23.099 align:start position:0%
administrative rules for the first time
 
00:45:26.270 --> 00:45:26.280 align:start position:0%
in our office they were adopted back in
 
00:45:29.750 --> 00:45:29.760 align:start position:0%
October through that process of the
 
00:45:31.809 --> 00:45:31.819 align:start position:0%
people in the office
 
00:45:34.849 --> 00:45:34.859 align:start position:0%
had shared with us that we ought to just
 
00:45:38.270 --> 00:45:38.280 align:start position:0%
resolve this inconsistency uh in the
 
00:45:40.309 --> 00:45:40.319 align:start position:0%
statute and so that's why that's what
 
00:45:41.809 --> 00:45:41.819 align:start position:0%
brought it to our attention and why
 
00:45:45.290 --> 00:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
 
00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:47.400 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
00:45:50.870 --> 00:45:50.880 align:start position:0%
thank you thanks for taking my question
 
00:45:53.270 --> 00:45:53.280 align:start position:0%
have you been doing remote
 
00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:54.230 align:start position:0%
have you been doing remote
um

00:45:54.230 --> 00:45:54.240 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:45:54.240 --> 00:45:55.609 align:start position:0%
um
meetings

00:45:55.609 --> 00:45:55.619 align:start position:0%
meetings
 
00:45:58.550 --> 00:45:58.560 align:start position:0%
are you presently doing remote meetings
 
00:46:00.890 --> 00:46:00.900 align:start position:0%
even though this the statute had said
 
00:46:02.510 --> 00:46:02.520 align:start position:0%
that they needed to be at the state
 
00:46:05.569 --> 00:46:05.579 align:start position:0%
house right as as um Mr Haley pointed
 
00:46:09.470 --> 00:46:09.480 align:start position:0%
out the 725 gives us the
 
00:46:11.870 --> 00:46:11.880 align:start position:0%
um authority to establish the time and
 
00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:14.880 align:start position:0%
place and we have had investigative
 
00:46:16.849 --> 00:46:16.859 align:start position:0%
meetings through
 
00:46:20.030 --> 00:46:20.040 align:start position:0%
um uh video conference it's been more
 
00:46:22.550 --> 00:46:22.560 align:start position:0%
convenient to those that we're meeting
 
00:46:24.710 --> 00:46:24.720 align:start position:0%
with uh when we can meet with them in
 
00:46:27.470 --> 00:46:27.480 align:start position:0%
person we try to do that but oftentimes
 
00:46:29.690 --> 00:46:29.700 align:start position:0%
it's it's inconvenient for these
 
00:46:32.170 --> 00:46:32.180 align:start position:0%
volunteer board members
 
00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:36.780 align:start position:0%
yes so do you think that
 
00:46:38.630 --> 00:46:38.640 align:start position:0%
in your
 
00:46:42.109 --> 00:46:42.119 align:start position:0%
that it should say that those particular
 
00:46:46.069 --> 00:46:46.079 align:start position:0%
video conferencing meetings
 
00:46:48.410 --> 00:46:48.420 align:start position:0%
are allowed because this is just saying
 
00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:50.760 align:start position:0%
you're taking away a space is there so I
 
00:46:52.190 --> 00:46:52.200 align:start position:0%
understand it gives you the right to
 
00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760 align:start position:0%
pick the time and place
 
00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:56.540 align:start position:0%
but time and place to me
 
00:47:00.050 --> 00:47:00.060 align:start position:0%
is not video conferencing so I just
 
00:47:02.270 --> 00:47:02.280 align:start position:0%
wonder whether that's
 
00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:02.950 align:start position:0%
wonder whether that's
um

00:47:02.950 --> 00:47:02.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.490 align:start position:0%
um
perhaps

00:47:04.490 --> 00:47:04.500 align:start position:0%
perhaps
 
00:47:07.790 --> 00:47:07.800 align:start position:0%
going over the over the line of what
 
00:47:10.130 --> 00:47:10.140 align:start position:0%
this is allowing
 
00:47:11.809 --> 00:47:11.819 align:start position:0%
thank you for the question
 
00:47:14.150 --> 00:47:14.160 align:start position:0%
um to point out a few things so the
 
00:47:16.130 --> 00:47:16.140 align:start position:0%
current statute allows us to require
 
00:47:18.170 --> 00:47:18.180 align:start position:0%
that someone appear at the State House
 
00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:20.640 align:start position:0%
for one of these depositions
 
00:47:22.970 --> 00:47:22.980 align:start position:0%
um by agreement we could always meet in
 
00:47:25.970 --> 00:47:25.980 align:start position:0%
some other Forum um so I think that
 
00:47:28.550 --> 00:47:28.560 align:start position:0%
hypothetically someone could assert
 
00:47:30.349 --> 00:47:30.359 align:start position:0%
their right under the statute to demand
 
00:47:32.270 --> 00:47:32.280 align:start position:0%
that they have their interview at the
 
00:47:34.309 --> 00:47:34.319 align:start position:0%
state house and that could cause a
 
00:47:36.130 --> 00:47:36.140 align:start position:0%
problem if there's no space available
 
00:47:39.829 --> 00:47:39.839 align:start position:0%
but I don't believe that anything would
 
00:47:42.170 --> 00:47:42.180 align:start position:0%
require that the statute say that it can
 
00:47:44.150 --> 00:47:44.160 align:start position:0%
be conducted by video conference we
 
00:47:46.069 --> 00:47:46.079 align:start position:0%
conduct all kinds of business over the
 
00:47:48.170 --> 00:47:48.180 align:start position:0%
phone and over video conference
 
00:47:50.329 --> 00:47:50.339 align:start position:0%
um and it doesn't mean that the
 
00:47:51.950 --> 00:47:51.960 align:start position:0%
information that we would solicit from
 
00:47:53.589 --> 00:47:53.599 align:start position:0%
that interview would somehow be
 
00:47:57.770 --> 00:47:57.780 align:start position:0%
 
00:47:59.030 --> 00:47:59.040 align:start position:0%
the question yes representative
 
00:48:01.910 --> 00:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair um is there
 
00:48:03.890 --> 00:48:03.900 align:start position:0%
how often does somebody assert their
 
00:48:05.569 --> 00:48:05.579 align:start position:0%
right to appear at a hearing at the
 
00:48:06.950 --> 00:48:06.960 align:start position:0%
state house
 
00:48:09.710 --> 00:48:09.720 align:start position:0%
um one question and number two if you're
 
00:48:11.210 --> 00:48:11.220 align:start position:0%
already doing electronic meetings what's
 
00:48:12.950 --> 00:48:12.960 align:start position:0%
the point of amending the statute if
 
00:48:15.349 --> 00:48:15.359 align:start position:0%
you've already been allowed to do it
 
00:48:17.450 --> 00:48:17.460 align:start position:0%
this was an thank you for your question
 
00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:19.680 align:start position:0%
this uh was
 
00:48:21.290 --> 00:48:21.300 align:start position:0%
um something that was pointed out during
 
00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:22.980 align:start position:0%
the rule making process is something
 
00:48:24.829 --> 00:48:24.839 align:start position:0%
that we ought to address which is why
 
00:48:26.750 --> 00:48:26.760 align:start position:0%
we're addressing it uh today and we
 
00:48:28.430 --> 00:48:28.440 align:start position:0%
appreciate the sponsors for having
 
00:48:30.770 --> 00:48:30.780 align:start position:0%
sponsored this legislation
 
00:48:33.589 --> 00:48:33.599 align:start position:0%
uh your first question was Mike my
 
00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:36.180 align:start position:0%
question is are we removing somebody's
 
00:48:38.870 --> 00:48:38.880 align:start position:0%
right to have a physical hearing at a
 
00:48:44.390 --> 00:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
 
00:48:47.569 --> 00:48:47.579 align:start position:0%
the attorney general has the um right to
 
00:48:50.150 --> 00:48:50.160 align:start position:0%
designate the time and place of the
 
00:48:52.309 --> 00:48:52.319 align:start position:0%
investigative meeting already under the
 
00:48:54.170 --> 00:48:54.180 align:start position:0%
statute so it wouldn't it shouldn't
 
00:48:56.450 --> 00:48:56.460 align:start position:0%
affect my concern is is somebody who's
 
00:48:58.910 --> 00:48:58.920 align:start position:0%
being investigated may not want to be
 
00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:01.079 align:start position:0%
investigated over Zoom may want a
 
00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960 align:start position:0%
physical location for a hearing and if
 
00:49:05.569 --> 00:49:05.579 align:start position:0%
we remove this language are we
 
00:49:07.130 --> 00:49:07.140 align:start position:0%
restricting their right to have a
 
00:49:12.470 --> 00:49:12.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:49:14.870 --> 00:49:14.880 align:start position:0%
no again I don't think that it would
 
00:49:18.290 --> 00:49:18.300 align:start position:0%
affect it first of all we prefer in
 
00:49:18.300 --> 00:49:19.130 align:start position:0%
affect it first of all we prefer in
person

00:49:19.130 --> 00:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
person
 
00:49:22.309 --> 00:49:22.319 align:start position:0%
we would much prefer to have meet with
 
00:49:25.010 --> 00:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
someone in person than have it video by
 
00:49:28.670 --> 00:49:28.680 align:start position:0%
video we allow video for the convenience
 
00:49:31.490 --> 00:49:31.500 align:start position:0%
of the people we're investigating so if
 
00:49:34.790 --> 00:49:34.800 align:start position:0%
uh that's typically we much prefer in
 
00:49:37.309 --> 00:49:37.319 align:start position:0%
person uh but I don't think that it
 
00:49:42.710 --> 00:49:42.720 align:start position:0%
affects it because of RSA 725
 
00:49:45.230 --> 00:49:45.240 align:start position:0%
yep please would you be amenable to
 
00:49:46.790 --> 00:49:46.800 align:start position:0%
language that says nothing in a statue
 
00:49:49.490 --> 00:49:49.500 align:start position:0%
would preclude uh somebody's right to
 
00:49:50.930 --> 00:49:50.940 align:start position:0%
have a physical
 
00:49:53.270 --> 00:49:53.280 align:start position:0%
investigation like a locate physical
 
00:49:57.710 --> 00:49:57.720 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:00.109 --> 00:50:00.119 align:start position:0%
I think thank you for your question I
 
00:50:01.609 --> 00:50:01.619 align:start position:0%
think that that would might conflict
 
00:50:06.349 --> 00:50:06.359 align:start position:0%
with 725 uh and uh which gives us the
 
00:50:10.250 --> 00:50:10.260 align:start position:0%
right to uh set establish the date and
 
00:50:14.450 --> 00:50:14.460 align:start position:0%
the time and the place uh so uh I'm not
 
00:50:16.609 --> 00:50:16.619 align:start position:0%
sure what our the position of our office
 
00:50:19.910 --> 00:50:19.920 align:start position:0%
would be on that until I saw the
 
00:50:19.920 --> 00:50:22.309 align:start position:0%
would be on that until I saw the
language

00:50:22.309 --> 00:50:22.319 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:24.589 --> 00:50:24.599 align:start position:0%
other other questions yes uh
 
00:50:25.970 --> 00:50:25.980 align:start position:0%
representative Tripp
 
00:50:29.809 --> 00:50:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh I just wanted to to mention that uh I
 
00:50:31.790 --> 00:50:31.800 align:start position:0%
can't remember the gentleman's name but
 
00:50:36.710 --> 00:50:36.720 align:start position:0%
uh he he's basically said that uh uh RSA
 
00:50:40.730 --> 00:50:40.740 align:start position:0%
725 uh contains other requirements for
 
00:50:44.390 --> 00:50:44.400 align:start position:0%
uh or specifications for meetings which
 
00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:47.400 align:start position:0%
probably enhance what uh was said here
 
00:50:51.530 --> 00:50:51.540 align:start position:0%
 
00:50:53.690 --> 00:50:53.700 align:start position:0%
it might be I know there's a question
 
00:50:55.849 --> 00:50:55.859 align:start position:0%
here someplace right sorry
 
00:51:00.890 --> 00:51:00.900 align:start position:0%
uh I caught myself uh does 725 uh
 
00:51:03.049 --> 00:51:03.059 align:start position:0%
contain other uh requirements for
 
00:51:06.589 --> 00:51:06.599 align:start position:0%
 
00:51:09.829 --> 00:51:09.839 align:start position:0%
so uh 725 lays out a number of
 
00:51:12.290 --> 00:51:12.300 align:start position:0%
requirements it requires that we issue a
 
00:51:14.390 --> 00:51:14.400 align:start position:0%
notice of investigation that specifies
 
00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:16.619 align:start position:0%
the time and the place that identifies
 
00:51:19.430 --> 00:51:19.440 align:start position:0%
the purpose of the investigation and
 
00:51:21.049 --> 00:51:21.059 align:start position:0%
specifies to the person being
 
00:51:22.910 --> 00:51:22.920 align:start position:0%
investigated with the consequences of
 
00:51:25.670 --> 00:51:25.680 align:start position:0%
failing to comply are so it sets out a
 
00:51:28.089 --> 00:51:28.099 align:start position:0%
set of sort of due process requirements
 
00:51:30.589 --> 00:51:30.599 align:start position:0%
that have to be met before we can have
 
00:51:32.809 --> 00:51:32.819 align:start position:0%
one of these investigative interviews
 
00:51:34.430 --> 00:51:34.440 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
00:51:36.170 --> 00:51:36.180 align:start position:0%
representative Horrigan
 
00:51:39.170 --> 00:51:39.180 align:start position:0%
um yes we have an ongoing controversy
 
00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
here in New Hampshire over the school
 
00:51:42.710 --> 00:51:42.720 align:start position:0%
Voucher Program which is administered by
 
00:51:45.410 --> 00:51:45.420 align:start position:0%
an organization which I believe is a 501
 
00:51:48.170 --> 00:51:48.180 align:start position:0%
C3 and then comes under your preview and
 
00:51:50.089 --> 00:51:50.099 align:start position:0%
I'm not asking you to wait in that
 
00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:52.920 align:start position:0%
controversy specifically but is that a
 
00:51:54.829 --> 00:51:54.839 align:start position:0%
unique Arrangement or is it common in
 
00:51:56.750 --> 00:51:56.760 align:start position:0%
does your office have at least some
 
00:51:58.910 --> 00:51:58.920 align:start position:0%
jurisdiction over
 
00:52:01.670 --> 00:52:01.680 align:start position:0%
uh charitable charitable entities that
 
00:52:03.950 --> 00:52:03.960 align:start position:0%
are administering State programs
 
00:52:06.410 --> 00:52:06.420 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so we
 
00:52:06.420 --> 00:52:07.750 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question so we
oversee

00:52:07.750 --> 00:52:07.760 align:start position:0%
oversee
 
00:52:12.589 --> 00:52:12.599 align:start position:0%
over 6 500 new hampshire-based
 
00:52:15.589 --> 00:52:15.599 align:start position:0%
charitable organizations so the the
 
00:52:18.290 --> 00:52:18.300 align:start position:0%
remaining of the 11 000 are out of state
 
00:52:23.030 --> 00:52:23.040 align:start position:0%
uh a number of the uh Charities that we
 
00:52:27.650 --> 00:52:27.660 align:start position:0%
over see do have contracts with the
 
00:52:30.410 --> 00:52:30.420 align:start position:0%
state a number of them do uh some are
 
00:52:33.290 --> 00:52:33.300 align:start position:0%
even charter schools for example we the
 
00:52:36.049 --> 00:52:36.059 align:start position:0%
charter schools there are a number of
 
00:52:38.750 --> 00:52:38.760 align:start position:0%
Social Service organizations that have
 
00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:41.160 align:start position:0%
contracts with the state and yes that is
 
00:52:43.309 --> 00:52:43.319 align:start position:0%
part of our oversight Authority they
 
00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:45.839 align:start position:0%
submit annual reports to our office and
 
00:52:48.049 --> 00:52:48.059 align:start position:0%
we review those reports the annual
 
00:52:50.210 --> 00:52:50.220 align:start position:0%
reports uh
 
00:52:50.220 --> 00:52:50.890 align:start position:0%
reports uh
um

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:50.900 align:start position:0%
um
 
00:52:54.770 --> 00:52:54.780 align:start position:0%
involve a financial report as well as a
 
00:52:56.450 --> 00:52:56.460 align:start position:0%
report on their governance their board

of directors and that sort of thing
 
00:53:01.370 --> 00:53:01.380 align:start position:0%
thanks thanks
 
00:53:03.950 --> 00:53:03.960 align:start position:0%
other uh representative Stapleton and
 
00:53:05.930 --> 00:53:05.940 align:start position:0%
then representative Alexander
 
00:53:08.450 --> 00:53:08.460 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:53:11.270 --> 00:53:11.280 align:start position:0%
we currently have now and have had in
 
00:53:14.870 --> 00:53:14.880 align:start position:0%
the past some bills um
 
00:53:18.290 --> 00:53:18.300 align:start position:0%
uh relative to video conferencing that
 
00:53:18.300 --> 00:53:19.190 align:start position:0%
uh relative to video conferencing that
uh

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:19.200 align:start position:0%
uh
 
00:53:21.650 --> 00:53:21.660 align:start position:0%
people are for and against
 
00:53:24.589 --> 00:53:24.599 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if to make it
 
00:53:24.599 --> 00:53:25.910 align:start position:0%
and I'm just wondering if to make it
clear

00:53:25.910 --> 00:53:25.920 align:start position:0%
clear
 
00:53:29.809 --> 00:53:29.819 align:start position:0%
uh to use that particular medium
 
00:53:32.630 --> 00:53:32.640 align:start position:0%
that it wouldn't behoove us to have a
 
00:53:35.329 --> 00:53:35.339 align:start position:0%
mention of it in this particular
 
00:53:35.339 --> 00:53:36.770 align:start position:0%
mention of it in this particular
bill

00:53:36.770 --> 00:53:36.780 align:start position:0%
bill
 
00:53:39.650 --> 00:53:39.660 align:start position:0%
to remove doubt and uncertainty and then
 
00:53:43.670 --> 00:53:43.680 align:start position:0%
to clearly enable that as a known and
 
00:53:45.829 --> 00:53:45.839 align:start position:0%
acceptable method to
 
00:53:49.030 --> 00:53:49.040 align:start position:0%
conduct investigations subject to
 
00:53:55.250 --> 00:53:55.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:56.569 align:start position:0%
 
yeah

00:53:56.569 --> 00:53:56.579 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
00:53:59.270 --> 00:53:59.280 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question uh I
 
00:54:01.670 --> 00:54:01.680 align:start position:0%
think um that it would not be necessary
 
00:54:04.549 --> 00:54:04.559 align:start position:0%
for the reasons that Michael Haley
 
00:54:07.309 --> 00:54:07.319 align:start position:0%
shared I don't think it's necessary
 
00:54:10.210 --> 00:54:10.220 align:start position:0%
because it would be by agreement and so
 
00:54:12.890 --> 00:54:12.900 align:start position:0%
it's not necessary to include that in
 
00:54:15.349 --> 00:54:15.359 align:start position:0%
the in the statute but I appreciate the
 
00:54:17.450 --> 00:54:17.460 align:start position:0%
question thank you representative
 
00:54:19.490 --> 00:54:19.500 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you Mr chair I'm really
 
00:54:23.089 --> 00:54:23.099 align:start position:0%
trying not to be difficult but um yeah
 
00:54:25.730 --> 00:54:25.740 align:start position:0%
I I see simple fixes as like being a
 
00:54:28.730 --> 00:54:28.740 align:start position:0%
little more complicated so um I is there
 
00:54:31.730 --> 00:54:31.740 align:start position:0%
anything in 725 that would require a
 
00:54:33.710 --> 00:54:33.720 align:start position:0%
meeting in a physical location
 
00:54:36.829 --> 00:54:36.839 align:start position:0%
if the subject that's being investigated
 
00:54:40.250 --> 00:54:40.260 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:42.170 --> 00:54:42.180 align:start position:0%
could you say could you tell them no
 
00:54:43.910 --> 00:54:43.920 align:start position:0%
because there's no requirement it has to
 
00:54:49.270 --> 00:54:49.280 align:start position:0%
 
00:54:52.390 --> 00:54:52.400 align:start position:0%
the RSA 720 thank you for your question
 
00:54:55.370 --> 00:54:55.380 align:start position:0%
RSA 725 does give the Attorney General
 
00:54:57.230 --> 00:54:57.240 align:start position:0%
the right to designate the time and
 
00:55:00.890 --> 00:55:00.900 align:start position:0%
place of of of an investigation okay so
 
00:55:03.530 --> 00:55:03.540 align:start position:0%
this removes the right for somebody
 
00:55:05.809 --> 00:55:05.819 align:start position:0%
that's being investigated to have it in
 
00:55:08.089 --> 00:55:08.099 align:start position:0%
person if they request an in-person
 
00:55:10.790 --> 00:55:10.800 align:start position:0%
physical investigation
 
00:55:11.930 --> 00:55:11.940 align:start position:0%
um thank you for your question but I
 
00:55:13.849 --> 00:55:13.859 align:start position:0%
don't think it does I think that there
 
00:55:17.030 --> 00:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
is an inconsistency in in the uh two
 
00:55:19.190 --> 00:55:19.200 align:start position:0%
statutes which is why the rules of
 
00:55:22.010 --> 00:55:22.020 align:start position:0%
people told us to have that language
 
00:55:23.569 --> 00:55:23.579 align:start position:0%
removed because there was an
 
00:55:23.579 --> 00:55:25.130 align:start position:0%
removed because there was an
inconsistency

00:55:25.130 --> 00:55:25.140 align:start position:0%
inconsistency
 
00:55:27.290 --> 00:55:27.300 align:start position:0%
and as a matter of practice we always
 
00:55:29.809 --> 00:55:29.819 align:start position:0%
specify a physical place for the
 
00:55:32.990 --> 00:55:33.000 align:start position:0%
investigations and then afterwards if an
 
00:55:34.670 --> 00:55:34.680 align:start position:0%
investigative party requests a video
 
00:55:36.230 --> 00:55:36.240 align:start position:0%
conference we make that available to
 
00:55:39.049 --> 00:55:39.059 align:start position:0%
them so we are in practice saying come
 
00:55:41.390 --> 00:55:41.400 align:start position:0%
to the Attorney General's office or uh
 
00:55:43.910 --> 00:55:43.920 align:start position:0%
to to have this investigation happen
 
00:55:45.710 --> 00:55:45.720 align:start position:0%
um we we don't start with video
 
00:55:48.890 --> 00:55:48.900 align:start position:0%
conferences the first offer
 
00:55:50.809 --> 00:55:50.819 align:start position:0%
other questions for yes representative
 
00:55:50.819 --> 00:55:52.130 align:start position:0%
other questions for yes representative
Lanza

00:55:52.130 --> 00:55:52.140 align:start position:0%
Lanza
 
00:55:54.349 --> 00:55:54.359 align:start position:0%
thank you for taking my question
 
00:55:57.770 --> 00:55:57.780 align:start position:0%
um so I'm a little confused about why
 
00:55:59.950 --> 00:55:59.960 align:start position:0%
this has been going on for many years
 
00:56:03.530 --> 00:56:03.540 align:start position:0%
why we now need to change this to
 
00:56:06.589 --> 00:56:06.599 align:start position:0%
another and get rid of this physical
 
00:56:10.069 --> 00:56:10.079 align:start position:0%
location and and everything why why is
 
00:56:10.079 --> 00:56:11.690 align:start position:0%
location and and everything why why is
this

00:56:11.690 --> 00:56:11.700 align:start position:0%
this
 
00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
thank you for your question again this
 
00:56:15.410 --> 00:56:15.420 align:start position:0%
was brought up during the rule making
 
00:56:18.530 --> 00:56:18.540 align:start position:0%
process that we ought to remove the to
 
00:56:21.470 --> 00:56:21.480 align:start position:0%
that language in order to address the
 
00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:27.470 align:start position:0%
that language in order to address the
inconsistency

00:56:27.470 --> 00:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:30.109 --> 00:56:30.119 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
00:56:32.930 --> 00:56:32.940 align:start position:0%
are these Witnesses I should say none
 
00:56:35.630 --> 00:56:35.640 align:start position:0%
thank you please give my regards to your
 
00:56:42.130 --> 00:56:42.140 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:46.609 --> 00:56:46.619 align:start position:0%
anyone else wishing to testify on
 
00:56:50.569 --> 00:56:50.579 align:start position:0%
 
00:56:52.549 --> 00:56:52.559 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
00:56:55.490 --> 00:56:55.500 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 59 and we're once
 
00:56:55.500 --> 00:56:56.329 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 59 and we're once
again

00:56:56.329 --> 00:56:56.339 align:start position:0%
again
 
00:56:58.609 --> 00:56:58.619 align:start position:0%
somewhat ahead of schedule so we'll take
 
01:02:45.289 --> 01:02:45.299 align:start position:0%
 
01:02:49.490 --> 01:02:49.500 align:start position:0%
it's after uh 11. and so I'm going to
 
01:02:55.250 --> 01:02:55.260 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on Senate Bill 89 and I
 
01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480 align:start position:0%
will recognize Senator Regina bird cell
 
01:03:09.349 --> 01:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
 
01:03:12.230 --> 01:03:12.240 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair for the record my
 
01:03:13.970 --> 01:03:13.980 align:start position:0%
name is Regina bartsell I'm a state
 
01:03:16.450 --> 01:03:16.460 align:start position:0%
senator for district 19 which
 
01:03:20.089 --> 01:03:20.099 align:start position:0%
encompasses the towns a dairy Hampstead
 
01:03:22.670 --> 01:03:22.680 align:start position:0%
and Windham and I'm here to introduce
 
01:03:25.970 --> 01:03:25.980 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 89 it's basically a fairly
 
01:03:29.690 --> 01:03:29.700 align:start position:0%
simple bill it was requested the town
 
01:03:31.309 --> 01:03:31.319 align:start position:0%
clerk's Association had basically
 
01:03:36.170 --> 01:03:36.180 align:start position:0%
requested this and specifically
 
01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:37.430 align:start position:0%
requested this and specifically
um

01:03:37.430 --> 01:03:37.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:03:39.650 --> 01:03:39.660 align:start position:0%
the town clerk I used to be in Dairy is
 
01:03:41.870 --> 01:03:41.880 align:start position:0%
now in I think um
 
01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:43.190 align:start position:0%
now in I think um
Nashua

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
Nashua
 
01:03:46.069 --> 01:03:46.079 align:start position:0%
so I thought they would be here to help
 
01:03:49.010 --> 01:03:49.020 align:start position:0%
out they're not so
 
01:03:51.710 --> 01:03:51.720 align:start position:0%
um basically what this deal does this
 
01:03:53.690 --> 01:03:53.700 align:start position:0%
bill permits but does not require the
 
01:03:55.490 --> 01:03:55.500 align:start position:0%
city or town clerk to accommodate
 
01:03:58.670 --> 01:03:58.680 align:start position:0%
parties who are unable to appear in
 
01:04:00.530 --> 01:04:00.540 align:start position:0%
person for a marriage license due to
 
01:04:04.809 --> 01:04:04.819 align:start position:0%
medical reasons so um they had requested
 
01:04:09.049 --> 01:04:09.059 align:start position:0%
they under normal circumstances the town
 
01:04:11.089 --> 01:04:11.099 align:start position:0%
clerks will try and accommodate
 
01:04:14.030 --> 01:04:14.040 align:start position:0%
sometimes they can't always do that so
 
01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:18.299 align:start position:0%
they wanted the language change to May
 
01:04:18.299 --> 01:04:19.490 align:start position:0%
they wanted the language change to May
um

01:04:19.490 --> 01:04:19.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.470 align:start position:0%
um
um

01:04:21.470 --> 01:04:21.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:04:24.770 --> 01:04:24.780 align:start position:0%
to permit but not require them to
 
01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:25.190 align:start position:0%
to permit but not require them to
[Music]

01:04:25.190 --> 01:04:25.200 align:start position:0%
[Music]
 
01:04:25.200 --> 01:04:29.089 align:start position:0%
[Music]
um

01:04:29.089 --> 01:04:29.099 align:start position:0%
 
01:04:30.789 --> 01:04:30.799 align:start position:0%
accommodate the parties because
 
01:04:34.309 --> 01:04:34.319 align:start position:0%
sometimes what happens is when you're
 
01:04:36.950 --> 01:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
going for your license marriage license
 
01:04:42.650 --> 01:04:42.660 align:start position:0%
you um the town clerks require some
 
01:04:45.049 --> 01:04:45.059 align:start position:0%
paperwork they don't always have the
 
01:04:47.089 --> 01:04:47.099 align:start position:0%
capability of making the copies where
 
01:04:48.770 --> 01:04:48.780 align:start position:0%
where they're
 
01:04:51.470 --> 01:04:51.480 align:start position:0%
um at the individual's home especially
 
01:04:53.510 --> 01:04:53.520 align:start position:0%
if they're elderly or if they're in a
 
01:04:55.609 --> 01:04:55.619 align:start position:0%
nursing home and I apparently that has
 
01:04:58.490 --> 01:04:58.500 align:start position:0%
happened so that's what this bill does
 
01:05:02.890 --> 01:05:02.900 align:start position:0%
it allows them to go reach out to their
 
01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:05.579 align:start position:0%
their constituent or their to
 
01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:07.079 align:start position:0%
accommodate the parties but does not
 
01:05:09.349 --> 01:05:09.359 align:start position:0%
require them all right
 
01:05:12.650 --> 01:05:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:14.329 --> 01:05:14.339 align:start position:0%
it's good to see you
 
01:05:19.730 --> 01:05:19.740 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:23.390 --> 01:05:23.400 align:start position:0%
um on line four uh the bill says shall
 
01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:25.740 align:start position:0%
it does not say May
 
01:05:29.990 --> 01:05:30.000 align:start position:0%
and I'm wondering if you can
 
01:05:33.470 --> 01:05:33.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:05:36.470 --> 01:05:36.480 align:start position:0%
on line four mine says shell is lined
 
01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:40.079 align:start position:0%
out but may is in there oh oh we've got
 
01:05:45.490 --> 01:05:45.500 align:start position:0%
a well we have as amended by the Senate
 
01:05:50.150 --> 01:05:50.160 align:start position:0%
and mine is as introduced
 
01:05:52.490 --> 01:05:52.500 align:start position:0%
so he has amended by the Senate it says
 
01:05:55.789 --> 01:05:55.799 align:start position:0%
shall yes yeah ours that's it should be
 
01:05:55.799 --> 01:05:57.049 align:start position:0%
shall yes yeah ours that's it should be
May

01:05:57.049 --> 01:05:57.059 align:start position:0%
May
 
01:05:57.059 --> 01:05:59.270 align:start position:0%
May
well

01:05:59.270 --> 01:05:59.280 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:06:01.849 --> 01:06:01.859 align:start position:0%
Our obligation is to look at the spill
 
01:06:04.609 --> 01:06:04.619 align:start position:0%
as the Senate sends it to us even though
 
01:06:06.530 --> 01:06:06.540 align:start position:0%
you're probably right and the Senate
 
01:06:08.210 --> 01:06:08.220 align:start position:0%
isn't but uh
 
01:06:11.630 --> 01:06:11.640 align:start position:0%
I would never say on this one case
 
01:06:14.809 --> 01:06:14.819 align:start position:0%
um I would entertain an amendment to
 
01:06:17.450 --> 01:06:17.460 align:start position:0%
change it from Shell to May if you would
 
01:06:19.250 --> 01:06:19.260 align:start position:0%
like thank you could I follow up with
 
01:06:20.870 --> 01:06:20.880 align:start position:0%
one other question somebody somebody
 
01:06:22.190 --> 01:06:22.200 align:start position:0%
have May
 
01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:24.109 align:start position:0%
have May
vote

01:06:24.109 --> 01:06:24.119 align:start position:0%
vote
 
01:06:26.990 --> 01:06:27.000 align:start position:0%
okay wait so wait wait wait a minute so
 
01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.000 align:start position:0%
we we maybe we don't have
 
01:06:35.329 --> 01:06:35.339 align:start position:0%
what yeah okay no I'm looking at SB 89
 
01:06:38.390 --> 01:06:38.400 align:start position:0%
as amended by the Senate
 
01:06:41.230 --> 01:06:41.240 align:start position:0%
oh it's
 
01:06:43.670 --> 01:06:43.680 align:start position:0%
0825s correct
 
01:06:48.250 --> 01:06:48.260 align:start position:0%
and that is what was right sent to us
 
01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:52.319 align:start position:0%
what does it say in the top of yours
 
01:06:54.230 --> 01:06:54.240 align:start position:0%
that's to say it's amended by the Senate
 
01:06:56.089 --> 01:06:56.099 align:start position:0%
does it say it's introduced
 
01:06:56.099 --> 01:06:57.349 align:start position:0%
does it say it's introduced
yeah

01:06:57.349 --> 01:06:57.359 align:start position:0%
yeah
 
01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:01.260 align:start position:0%
and I have no amendments to in my folder
 
01:07:04.730 --> 01:07:04.740 align:start position:0%
so I don't know who amended it well
 
01:07:06.589 --> 01:07:06.599 align:start position:0%
I don't know what they do we never know
 
01:07:08.270 --> 01:07:08.280 align:start position:0%
what happens in the center so we can't
 
01:07:11.390 --> 01:07:11.400 align:start position:0%
help you well let's blame OLS
 
01:07:14.809 --> 01:07:14.819 align:start position:0%
no I don't want to blame anybody
 
01:07:16.849 --> 01:07:16.859 align:start position:0%
um I'm not interested in blame I'm just
 
01:07:20.270 --> 01:07:20.280 align:start position:0%
interested in good legislation so but
 
01:07:22.789 --> 01:07:22.799 align:start position:0%
what the what the clerks have asked for
 
01:07:25.789 --> 01:07:25.799 align:start position:0%
is may not show correct because they
 
01:07:27.170 --> 01:07:27.180 align:start position:0%
wanted to uh they don't want to be
 
01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:29.400 align:start position:0%
required to do it they would like when
 
01:07:31.849 --> 01:07:31.859 align:start position:0%
they can accommodate well as it came to
 
01:07:35.569 --> 01:07:35.579 align:start position:0%
us it's shall so I'm glad to know what
 
01:07:37.430 --> 01:07:37.440 align:start position:0%
the Senate says could I ask one other
 
01:07:40.010 --> 01:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
question Mr chair yes of course what
 
01:07:43.370 --> 01:07:43.380 align:start position:0%
does documented mean
 
01:07:47.930 --> 01:07:47.940 align:start position:0%
with regards to it says for documented
 
01:07:51.829 --> 01:07:51.839 align:start position:0%
medical reasons what does that mean can
 
01:07:53.510 --> 01:07:53.520 align:start position:0%
I write a letter saying I don't feel
 
01:07:54.589 --> 01:07:54.599 align:start position:0%
well today
 
01:07:57.650 --> 01:07:57.660 align:start position:0%
no I I believe it has to be medically
 
01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.089 align:start position:0%
no I I believe it has to be medically
documented

01:07:59.089 --> 01:07:59.099 align:start position:0%
documented
 
01:08:01.849 --> 01:08:01.859 align:start position:0%
but um again this would be an answer
 
01:08:04.789 --> 01:08:04.799 align:start position:0%
that the town clerks since they deal
 
01:08:08.450 --> 01:08:08.460 align:start position:0%
with it I can ask um
 
01:08:11.210 --> 01:08:11.220 align:start position:0%
contact Dan Healy
 
01:08:14.089 --> 01:08:14.099 align:start position:0%
you know Senator just uh representative
 
01:08:15.710 --> 01:08:15.720 align:start position:0%
Wallace points out there if you look at
 
01:08:17.689 --> 01:08:17.699 align:start position:0%
the docket of the bill apparently there
 
01:08:19.189 --> 01:08:19.199 align:start position:0%
was an amendment
 
01:08:26.209 --> 01:08:26.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:27.950 --> 01:08:27.960 align:start position:0%
all right Michelle that's interesting
 
01:08:30.050 --> 01:08:30.060 align:start position:0%
because I don't have it
 
01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:32.819 align:start position:0%
go and I don't have the docket do you
 
01:08:37.309 --> 01:08:37.319 align:start position:0%
 
01:08:39.169 --> 01:08:39.179 align:start position:0%
that's just speaking personally I don't
 
01:08:42.349 --> 01:08:42.359 align:start position:0%
know what anybody else to me
 
01:08:44.150 --> 01:08:44.160 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure it makes much difference to
 
01:08:45.709 --> 01:08:45.719 align:start position:0%
me personally whether it said May or
 
01:08:47.990 --> 01:08:48.000 align:start position:0%
shell but I guess the thing I raise is
 
01:08:51.789 --> 01:08:51.799 align:start position:0%
if it was the subject of an amendment
 
01:08:55.849 --> 01:08:55.859 align:start position:0%
that in the Senate I'm do you mean if we
 
01:08:58.669 --> 01:08:58.679 align:start position:0%
were to if if one of us were to propose
 
01:09:00.169 --> 01:09:00.179 align:start position:0%
an amendment in the house now to change
 
01:09:01.610 --> 01:09:01.620 align:start position:0%
shell to May
 
01:09:03.590 --> 01:09:03.600 align:start position:0%
does that mean
 
01:09:05.570 --> 01:09:05.580 align:start position:0%
that there would be
 
01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:07.920 align:start position:0%
some problem and if it went if it then
 
01:09:09.530 --> 01:09:09.540 align:start position:0%
went back to the Senate there would be
 
01:09:10.910 --> 01:09:10.920 align:start position:0%
some problem with the Senate because
 
01:09:12.470 --> 01:09:12.480 align:start position:0%
they would say wait a minute no we
 
01:09:14.930 --> 01:09:14.940 align:start position:0%
didn't we wanted it to say shell as for
 
01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:16.199 align:start position:0%
our Amendment
 
01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:20.880 align:start position:0%
I can go ahead and talk to the chair
 
01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:22.249 align:start position:0%
I can go ahead and talk to the chair
um

01:09:22.249 --> 01:09:22.259 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:09:24.289 --> 01:09:24.299 align:start position:0%
of that committee I'm not sure which
 
01:09:26.030 --> 01:09:26.040 align:start position:0%
committee it went through
 
01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:28.070 align:start position:0%
committee it went through
electional

01:09:28.070 --> 01:09:28.080 align:start position:0%
electional
 
01:09:31.729 --> 01:09:31.739 align:start position:0%
um I'll talk to uh Senator gray and ask
 
01:09:34.030 --> 01:09:34.040 align:start position:0%
them why they changed it
 
01:09:38.930 --> 01:09:38.940 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:41.390 --> 01:09:41.400 align:start position:0%
s the floor amendment was
 
01:09:43.189 --> 01:09:43.199 align:start position:0%
um submitted to the Senate and the
 
01:09:44.930 --> 01:09:44.940 align:start position:0%
Senate then the doctor does it say with
 
01:09:46.610 --> 01:09:46.620 align:start position:0%
the vote is on that or was it a Voice
 
01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:49.849 align:start position:0%
the vote is on that or was it a Voice
vote

01:09:49.849 --> 01:09:49.859 align:start position:0%
 
01:09:51.950 --> 01:09:51.960 align:start position:0%
no five to zero would be in the
 
01:09:54.350 --> 01:09:54.360 align:start position:0%
committee opposed on consent and they
 
01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.470 align:start position:0%
committee opposed on consent and they
think

01:09:57.470 --> 01:09:57.480 align:start position:0%
 
01:10:00.530 --> 01:10:00.540 align:start position:0%
yeah so it looks like the major reason
 
01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:03.120 align:start position:0%
for the change was actually to require
 
01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:05.330 align:start position:0%
for the change was actually to require
that

01:10:05.330 --> 01:10:05.340 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.050 align:start position:0%
that
um

01:10:06.050 --> 01:10:06.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:07.970 --> 01:10:07.980 align:start position:0%
it must be for documented medical
 
01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:10.860 align:start position:0%
reasons so the the the main purpose of
 
01:10:12.590 --> 01:10:12.600 align:start position:0%
the amendment wasn't actually to change
 
01:10:14.870 --> 01:10:14.880 align:start position:0%
it from May to Shell but rather to
 
01:10:17.030 --> 01:10:17.040 align:start position:0%
require that the medical reason have to
 
01:10:18.410 --> 01:10:18.420 align:start position:0%
be documented because in the original
 
01:10:22.189 --> 01:10:22.199 align:start position:0%
language of the bill it just said
 
01:10:22.199 --> 01:10:23.330 align:start position:0%
language of the bill it just said
um

01:10:23.330 --> 01:10:23.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:10:25.250 --> 01:10:25.260 align:start position:0%
that basically
 
01:10:26.810 --> 01:10:26.820 align:start position:0%
um unable to appear in person for
 
01:10:28.370 --> 01:10:28.380 align:start position:0%
medical reasons it didn't say that it
 
01:10:30.470 --> 01:10:30.480 align:start position:0%
had to be documented medical reasons and
 
01:10:33.229 --> 01:10:33.239 align:start position:0%
so the amendment was changing it to say
 
01:10:35.149 --> 01:10:35.159 align:start position:0%
that it must be for documented medical
 
01:10:37.729 --> 01:10:37.739 align:start position:0%
reasons okay does that include
 
01:10:39.890 --> 01:10:39.900 align:start position:0%
electronically because that would appear
 
01:10:42.410 --> 01:10:42.420 align:start position:0%
to be another amendment so what line did
 
01:10:44.930 --> 01:10:44.940 align:start position:0%
they change to document it
 
01:10:48.169 --> 01:10:48.179 align:start position:0%
um on line three it says in person for
 
01:10:51.669 --> 01:10:51.679 align:start position:0%
documented medical reasons
 
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:54.060 align:start position:0%
could someone just hand the senator a
 
01:10:54.060 --> 01:10:55.910 align:start position:0%
could someone just hand the senator a
copy

01:10:55.910 --> 01:10:55.920 align:start position:0%
copy
 
01:10:58.550 --> 01:10:58.560 align:start position:0%
so I'm I'm wondering if if that may have
 
01:10:59.990 --> 01:11:00.000 align:start position:0%
happened on accident because in looking
 
01:11:03.530 --> 01:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
at the Senate hearing report the clerk
 
01:11:06.229 --> 01:11:06.239 align:start position:0%
um that from the clerk's Association
 
01:11:08.630 --> 01:11:08.640 align:start position:0%
that came out
 
01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:11.640 align:start position:0%
um did state that they ought they always
 
01:11:13.490 --> 01:11:13.500 align:start position:0%
try and accommodate somebody if they're
 
01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060 align:start position:0%
able to but they don't feel that they
 
01:11:16.910 --> 01:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
should be required to be able to do so
 
01:11:19.550 --> 01:11:19.560 align:start position:0%
the clerk's Association would be opposed
 
01:11:23.510 --> 01:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
to being required to do so because
 
01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:24.649 align:start position:0%
to being required to do so because
um

01:11:24.649 --> 01:11:24.659 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:11:29.450 --> 01:11:29.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:11:31.729 --> 01:11:31.739 align:start position:0%
um I I think what what they were doing
 
01:11:34.610 --> 01:11:34.620 align:start position:0%
they changed the language uh to appear
 
01:11:37.910 --> 01:11:37.920 align:start position:0%
in person for documented medical reasons
 
01:11:40.189 --> 01:11:40.199 align:start position:0%
the city or town clerk I don't think
 
01:11:43.189 --> 01:11:43.199 align:start position:0%
they changed I think when they drafted
 
01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:44.090 align:start position:0%
they changed I think when they drafted
this

01:11:44.090 --> 01:11:44.100 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:11:47.510 --> 01:11:47.520 align:start position:0%
they didn't pick up the May
 
01:11:50.689 --> 01:11:50.699 align:start position:0%
but I will clarify with Senator gray
 
01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:54.420 align:start position:0%
yeah okay and um let you know and if
 
01:11:58.130 --> 01:11:58.140 align:start position:0%
he's okay with that then um to change it
 
01:12:01.970 --> 01:12:01.980 align:start position:0%
to a May okay all right so so
 
01:12:01.980 --> 01:12:02.930 align:start position:0%
to a May okay all right so so
um

01:12:02.930 --> 01:12:02.940 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:04.790 --> 01:12:04.800 align:start position:0%
so you all right so you'll let I mean
 
01:12:06.290 --> 01:12:06.300 align:start position:0%
and there's no problem with that the
 
01:12:08.030 --> 01:12:08.040 align:start position:0%
only word that would need to be changed
 
01:12:10.189 --> 01:12:10.199 align:start position:0%
then in the in the
 
01:12:12.890 --> 01:12:12.900 align:start position:0%
bill as it is as it was amended would be
 
01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:14.760 align:start position:0%
to change the word shelter May correct
 
01:12:16.790 --> 01:12:16.800 align:start position:0%
except I don't know what documented
 
01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:20.580 align:start position:0%
me just says documented
 
01:12:23.330 --> 01:12:23.340 align:start position:0%
man I don't you know doc what this
 
01:12:25.910 --> 01:12:25.920 align:start position:0%
documented me yeah
 
01:12:27.649 --> 01:12:27.659 align:start position:0%
it doesn't that's right that's exactly
 
01:12:27.659 --> 01:12:29.209 align:start position:0%
it doesn't that's right that's exactly
right

01:12:29.209 --> 01:12:29.219 align:start position:0%
right
 
01:12:31.250 --> 01:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
yes representative Perez
 
01:12:33.590 --> 01:12:33.600 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:12:35.510 --> 01:12:35.520 align:start position:0%
having been a medical professional for
 
01:12:37.910 --> 01:12:37.920 align:start position:0%
42 years I have a concern about the word
 
01:12:37.920 --> 01:12:39.709 align:start position:0%
42 years I have a concern about the word
documented

01:12:39.709 --> 01:12:39.719 align:start position:0%
documented
 
01:12:39.719 --> 01:12:40.370 align:start position:0%
documented
um

01:12:40.370 --> 01:12:40.380 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:12:43.669 --> 01:12:43.679 align:start position:0%
I I could have asthma and get a doctor
 
01:12:45.590 --> 01:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
to say
 
01:12:49.669 --> 01:12:49.679 align:start position:0%
um you know uh Christine has asthma
 
01:12:53.990 --> 01:12:54.000 align:start position:0%
um I my concern is that documented is
 
01:12:56.330 --> 01:12:56.340 align:start position:0%
extremely vague
 
01:12:59.450 --> 01:12:59.460 align:start position:0%
um I would hate to see it being misused
 
01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:03.000 align:start position:0%
because it is vague
 
01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:03.709 align:start position:0%
because it is vague
um

01:13:03.709 --> 01:13:03.719 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:06.770 --> 01:13:06.780 align:start position:0%
I can understand a documented medical
 
01:13:09.649 --> 01:13:09.659 align:start position:0%
reason that would limit my ability
 
01:13:13.729 --> 01:13:13.739 align:start position:0%
to be able to present be presented to
 
01:13:15.290 --> 01:13:15.300 align:start position:0%
the town
 
01:13:17.290 --> 01:13:17.300 align:start position:0%
Clerk's Office
 
01:13:21.229 --> 01:13:21.239 align:start position:0%
my having asthma would not permit limit
 
01:13:23.990 --> 01:13:24.000 align:start position:0%
that so I think to just have it say
 
01:13:27.590 --> 01:13:27.600 align:start position:0%
documented document medical reason that
 
01:13:29.510 --> 01:13:29.520 align:start position:0%
would prohibit
 
01:13:31.729 --> 01:13:31.739 align:start position:0%
appearance at the Town Clerk or
 
01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:33.840 align:start position:0%
something that makes it less vague
 
01:13:36.169 --> 01:13:36.179 align:start position:0%
that's my personal concern about it I'm
 
01:13:37.430 --> 01:13:37.440 align:start position:0%
just looking up
 
01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:38.149 align:start position:0%
just looking up
um

01:13:38.149 --> 01:13:38.159 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:13:42.770 --> 01:13:42.780 align:start position:0%
RSA 5c 42 to see if there is a a
 
01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:44.750 align:start position:0%
RSA 5c 42 to see if there is a a
definition

01:13:44.750 --> 01:13:44.760 align:start position:0%
definition
 
01:13:44.760 --> 01:13:46.910 align:start position:0%
definition
man

01:13:46.910 --> 01:13:46.920 align:start position:0%
man
 
01:13:49.010 --> 01:13:49.020 align:start position:0%
yes representative uh
 
01:13:51.050 --> 01:13:51.060 align:start position:0%
Senator bird cell wouldn't you say that
 
01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:53.940 align:start position:0%
if it's instead saying May instead of
 
01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:56.520 align:start position:0%
shall that the clerk could decide if the
 
01:13:58.370 --> 01:13:58.380 align:start position:0%
documented medical reason was actually
 
01:14:00.050 --> 01:14:00.060 align:start position:0%
prohibiting them and was sufficient
 
01:14:02.450 --> 01:14:02.460 align:start position:0%
since it's saying that they don't have
 
01:14:04.430 --> 01:14:04.440 align:start position:0%
to accommodate the person they just may
 
01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:05.880 align:start position:0%
accommodate them that they would have
 
01:14:09.110 --> 01:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
the leeway to say this isn't this isn't
 
01:14:11.149 --> 01:14:11.159 align:start position:0%
sufficient I'm I'm going to choose not
 
01:14:13.070 --> 01:14:13.080 align:start position:0%
to accommodate you I would need
 
01:14:15.229 --> 01:14:15.239 align:start position:0%
something a letter saying from a from a
 
01:14:16.550 --> 01:14:16.560 align:start position:0%
doctor saying that you actually can't
 
01:14:18.050 --> 01:14:18.060 align:start position:0%
come in wouldn't it give them the leeway
 
01:14:22.189 --> 01:14:22.199 align:start position:0%
 
01:14:25.010 --> 01:14:25.020 align:start position:0%
yes all right representative Lorenzo
 
01:14:26.870 --> 01:14:26.880 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr Claire and thank you for
 
01:14:29.209 --> 01:14:29.219 align:start position:0%
taking my question I do have a concern
 
01:14:29.219 --> 01:14:30.709 align:start position:0%
taking my question I do have a concern
about

01:14:30.709 --> 01:14:30.719 align:start position:0%
about
 
01:14:34.010 --> 01:14:34.020 align:start position:0%
um the Shale versus May
 
01:14:38.390 --> 01:14:38.400 align:start position:0%
um distinction and also
 
01:14:40.370 --> 01:14:40.380 align:start position:0%
um we're talking about documented
 
01:14:43.070 --> 01:14:43.080 align:start position:0%
medical reasons wouldn't some of those
 
01:14:46.729 --> 01:14:46.739 align:start position:0%
things fall under the Ada
 
01:14:50.649 --> 01:14:50.659 align:start position:0%
I would presume so yes yeah so
 
01:14:56.990 --> 01:14:57.000 align:start position:0%
follow up if it does fall under Ada then
 
01:14:59.950 --> 01:14:59.960 align:start position:0%
it feels that
 
01:15:03.770 --> 01:15:03.780 align:start position:0%
the bill should say the correct shall
 
01:15:06.709 --> 01:15:06.719 align:start position:0%
make accommodation
 
01:15:10.070 --> 01:15:10.080 align:start position:0%
because once you say may then you've got
 
01:15:12.410 --> 01:15:12.420 align:start position:0%
the clerk in a position of making a
 
01:15:15.890 --> 01:15:15.900 align:start position:0%
decision as to who's worthy to have that
 
01:15:18.410 --> 01:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
accommodation I hope if you could follow
 
01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:20.760 align:start position:0%
me well I do follow you
 
01:15:23.450 --> 01:15:23.460 align:start position:0%
um my all I can say is this was
 
01:15:25.250 --> 01:15:25.260 align:start position:0%
requested from the town clerk so if they
 
01:15:26.930 --> 01:15:26.940 align:start position:0%
didn't feel that they were capable of
 
01:15:30.110 --> 01:15:30.120 align:start position:0%
making that determination obviously my
 
01:15:32.630 --> 01:15:32.640 align:start position:0%
my understanding when I talked to Dan
 
01:15:34.910 --> 01:15:34.920 align:start position:0%
Healy was a lot of times what happens is
 
01:15:36.830 --> 01:15:36.840 align:start position:0%
the town clerks are asked to go to the
 
01:15:38.930 --> 01:15:38.940 align:start position:0%
nursing home because there are
 
01:15:40.970 --> 01:15:40.980 align:start position:0%
individuals in nursing homes who want to
 
01:15:42.169 --> 01:15:42.179 align:start position:0%
get married
 
01:15:44.810 --> 01:15:44.820 align:start position:0%
and so
 
01:15:47.330 --> 01:15:47.340 align:start position:0%
um they will make the determination yes
 
01:15:50.149 --> 01:15:50.159 align:start position:0%
whether um the documentation but if
 
01:15:51.770 --> 01:15:51.780 align:start position:0%
you're going to if you're in it if
 
01:15:52.850 --> 01:15:52.860 align:start position:0%
they're going to a nursing home
 
01:15:56.570 --> 01:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
obviously they can't the individuals
 
01:15:58.669 --> 01:15:58.679 align:start position:0%
can't come to them for the marriage
 
01:16:01.370 --> 01:16:01.380 align:start position:0%
license they have to go to them they're
 
01:16:02.750 --> 01:16:02.760 align:start position:0%
not going to make a determination that
 
01:16:06.050 --> 01:16:06.060 align:start position:0%
they're not going to go for that reason
 
01:16:09.229 --> 01:16:09.239 align:start position:0%
follow-up I don't I don't think the um
 
01:16:09.239 --> 01:16:10.490 align:start position:0%
follow-up I don't I don't think the um
bill

01:16:10.490 --> 01:16:10.500 align:start position:0%
bill
 
01:16:14.990 --> 01:16:15.000 align:start position:0%
is narrowed to folks in a nursing home
 
01:16:17.149 --> 01:16:17.159 align:start position:0%
um well and they they really can't
 
01:16:19.610 --> 01:16:19.620 align:start position:0%
because you do have individuals who are
 
01:16:22.669 --> 01:16:22.679 align:start position:0%
limited at home as well
 
01:16:25.970 --> 01:16:25.980 align:start position:0%
so can I make a suggestion
 
01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:28.860 align:start position:0%
um I think that the New Hampshire Human
 
01:16:31.550 --> 01:16:31.560 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission should be involved in
 
01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.390 align:start position:0%
Rights Commission should be involved in
um

01:16:32.390 --> 01:16:32.400 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:36.169 --> 01:16:36.179 align:start position:0%
you know amending this bill so that the
 
01:16:40.070 --> 01:16:40.080 align:start position:0%
statute follows um the requirements of
 
01:16:43.310 --> 01:16:43.320 align:start position:0%
the Human Rights Commission thank you
 
01:16:45.470 --> 01:16:45.480 align:start position:0%
yes representative Smith
 
01:16:46.790 --> 01:16:46.800 align:start position:0%
you know
 
01:16:48.649 --> 01:16:48.659 align:start position:0%
um Senator one we think it's the
 
01:16:51.169 --> 01:16:51.179 align:start position:0%
simplest Bill somehow it always seems
 
01:16:53.149 --> 01:16:53.159 align:start position:0%
more complicated
 
01:16:53.159 --> 01:16:53.770 align:start position:0%
more complicated
um

01:16:53.770 --> 01:16:53.780 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:16:56.689 --> 01:16:56.699 align:start position:0%
uh I'm not planning
 
01:16:58.910 --> 01:16:58.920 align:start position:0%
to go to a nursing home soon nor am I
 
01:17:00.770 --> 01:17:00.780 align:start position:0%
planning to get married so this probably
 
01:17:02.689 --> 01:17:02.699 align:start position:0%
doesn't have already been there done
 
01:17:05.990 --> 01:17:06.000 align:start position:0%
that it probably doesn't apply to me but
 
01:17:08.990 --> 01:17:09.000 align:start position:0%
there is another group that is of
 
01:17:14.510 --> 01:17:14.520 align:start position:0%
concern to me and uh that involves human
 
01:17:14.520 --> 01:17:16.189 align:start position:0%
concern to me and uh that involves human
trafficking

01:17:16.189 --> 01:17:16.199 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
01:17:21.709 --> 01:17:21.719 align:start position:0%
and I wonder am I stretching things too
 
01:17:24.470 --> 01:17:24.480 align:start position:0%
much to think that
 
01:17:30.110 --> 01:17:30.120 align:start position:0%
there might be a case where the bride is
 
01:17:33.709 --> 01:17:33.719 align:start position:0%
not old and in a nursing home but Young
 
01:17:37.970 --> 01:17:37.980 align:start position:0%
and and is being pressured
 
01:17:39.590 --> 01:17:39.600 align:start position:0%
to marry
 
01:17:39.600 --> 01:17:41.630 align:start position:0%
to marry
and

01:17:41.630 --> 01:17:41.640 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:17:41.640 --> 01:17:44.209 align:start position:0%
and
um

01:17:44.209 --> 01:17:44.219 align:start position:0%
 
01:17:46.310 --> 01:17:46.320 align:start position:0%
I think it would be nice to have the
 
01:17:47.870 --> 01:17:47.880 align:start position:0%
added protection
 
01:17:51.590 --> 01:17:51.600 align:start position:0%
of knowing that the town clerk
 
01:17:54.649 --> 01:17:54.659 align:start position:0%
could use judgment as to whether this is
 
01:17:57.890 --> 01:17:57.900 align:start position:0%
appropriate to proceed and when you say
 
01:18:00.649 --> 01:18:00.659 align:start position:0%
 when the bill says as it comes to
 
01:18:02.270 --> 01:18:02.280 align:start position:0%
us says shall
 
01:18:05.750 --> 01:18:05.760 align:start position:0%
and when as my colleague talked about
 
01:18:08.510 --> 01:18:08.520 align:start position:0%
the vagueness of the word it it doesn't
 
01:18:12.590 --> 01:18:12.600 align:start position:0%
say it says documented medical reasons
 
01:18:15.110 --> 01:18:15.120 align:start position:0%
but it doesn't say what
 
01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:19.140 align:start position:0%
that what the documentation is
 
01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:21.530 align:start position:0%
that what the documentation is
um

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:21.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:18:23.630 --> 01:18:23.640 align:start position:0%
is it the at least theoretically
 
01:18:26.090 --> 01:18:26.100 align:start position:0%
possible that we might be denying
 
01:18:29.510 --> 01:18:29.520 align:start position:0%
protections to people who we in the
 
01:18:32.030 --> 01:18:32.040 align:start position:0%
state would want to protect I don't
 
01:18:34.610 --> 01:18:34.620 align:start position:0%
think this has anything to do with human
 
01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:36.350 align:start position:0%
think this has anything to do with human
trafficking

01:18:36.350 --> 01:18:36.360 align:start position:0%
trafficking
 
01:18:39.050 --> 01:18:39.060 align:start position:0%
I believe that this is a choice that the
 
01:18:40.910 --> 01:18:40.920 align:start position:0%
town clerks have made
 
01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.250 align:start position:0%
town clerks have made
for

01:18:42.250 --> 01:18:42.260 align:start position:0%
for
 
01:18:46.250 --> 01:18:46.260 align:start position:0%
anyone who's medically disabled that
 
01:18:48.169 --> 01:18:48.179 align:start position:0%
can't get out of their homes or the the
 
01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:51.560 align:start position:0%
nursing home to be able to go into their
 
01:18:56.330 --> 01:18:56.340 align:start position:0%
their home or the nursing home to issue
 
01:18:59.149 --> 01:18:59.159 align:start position:0%
the marriage license I I quite
 
01:19:01.189 --> 01:19:01.199 align:start position:0%
sympathize with what you say and then I
 
01:19:03.350 --> 01:19:03.360 align:start position:0%
go back to my concern about the of the
 
01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.669 align:start position:0%
go back to my concern about the of the
workshop

01:19:04.669 --> 01:19:04.679 align:start position:0%
workshop
 
01:19:08.750 --> 01:19:08.760 align:start position:0%
and so at some point we have to clarify
 
01:19:11.450 --> 01:19:11.460 align:start position:0%
that thank you for your Indulgence no I
 
01:19:12.770 --> 01:19:12.780 align:start position:0%
would I mean I would say for both the
 
01:19:14.270 --> 01:19:14.280 align:start position:0%
reasons that representative Smith said
 
01:19:15.590 --> 01:19:15.600 align:start position:0%
and the reasons that representative
 
01:19:18.709 --> 01:19:18.719 align:start position:0%
koutab said it seems to me that
 
01:19:21.169 --> 01:19:21.179 align:start position:0%
if you change the word shell to May then
 
01:19:24.649 --> 01:19:24.659 align:start position:0%
that that gives the clerk the clerk's
 
01:19:27.590 --> 01:19:27.600 align:start position:0%
discretion which and that discretion
 
01:19:29.090 --> 01:19:29.100 align:start position:0%
could include
 
01:19:31.130 --> 01:19:31.140 align:start position:0%
determining whether the circumstances
 
01:19:34.550 --> 01:19:34.560 align:start position:0%
seem suspicious so that you know the the
 
01:19:36.590 --> 01:19:36.600 align:start position:0%
clerk might say no I want I'm not going
 
01:19:38.030 --> 01:19:38.040 align:start position:0%
to do it in this case I want you to come
 
01:19:39.830 --> 01:19:39.840 align:start position:0%
in because maybe I have some concerns
 
01:19:41.930 --> 01:19:41.940 align:start position:0%
about the human trafficking kind of
 
01:19:46.430 --> 01:19:46.440 align:start position:0%
situation or the you know somebody says
 
01:19:49.430 --> 01:19:49.440 align:start position:0%
um uh you know I have a cold today and
 
01:19:51.229 --> 01:19:51.239 align:start position:0%
here's a letter saying I have a cold I
 
01:19:52.970 --> 01:19:52.980 align:start position:0%
don't want to come in the clerk could
 
01:19:54.649 --> 01:19:54.659 align:start position:0%
say no that's not good enough it's got
 
01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:56.280 align:start position:0%
to be that that's not sufficient
 
01:19:58.910 --> 01:19:58.920 align:start position:0%
documentation so I think that I think
 
01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:01.440 align:start position:0%
that if we make that change and as long
 
01:20:03.350 --> 01:20:03.360 align:start position:0%
as you know I guess my only request
 
01:20:05.570 --> 01:20:05.580 align:start position:0%
would be if you could check with Senator
 
01:20:07.550 --> 01:20:07.560 align:start position:0%
gray to make sure that if we make that
 
01:20:08.870 --> 01:20:08.880 align:start position:0%
change we're not going to be sending it
 
01:20:11.630 --> 01:20:11.640 align:start position:0%
back to uh to a problem in the Senate so
 
01:20:14.570 --> 01:20:14.580 align:start position:0%
to speak I confirm I will
 
01:20:16.430 --> 01:20:16.440 align:start position:0%
um do that thank you representative
 
01:20:16.440 --> 01:20:20.870 align:start position:0%
um do that thank you representative
Perez

01:20:20.870 --> 01:20:20.880 align:start position:0%
 
01:20:22.850 --> 01:20:22.860 align:start position:0%
again I have a lot of concerns about
 
01:20:25.790 --> 01:20:25.800 align:start position:0%
documented and I have to agree with
 
01:20:28.729 --> 01:20:28.739 align:start position:0%
representative Smith that first of all
 
01:20:30.530 --> 01:20:30.540 align:start position:0%
it should say that they are can
 
01:20:32.030 --> 01:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
physically not
 
01:20:35.630 --> 01:20:35.640 align:start position:0%
come to the town hall because
 
01:20:35.640 --> 01:20:36.290 align:start position:0%
come to the town hall because
um

01:20:36.290 --> 01:20:36.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:20:38.510 --> 01:20:38.520 align:start position:0%
I mean you do have people not just in
 
01:20:39.890 --> 01:20:39.900 align:start position:0%
nursing homes you have people that are
 
01:20:42.169 --> 01:20:42.179 align:start position:0%
dying of cancer at home that might want
 
01:20:45.709 --> 01:20:45.719 align:start position:0%
to get married and physically can but if
 
01:20:48.530 --> 01:20:48.540 align:start position:0%
somebody cannot physically come to the
 
01:20:50.149 --> 01:20:50.159 align:start position:0%
town hall
 
01:20:53.149 --> 01:20:53.159 align:start position:0%
how do you verify electronically that
 
01:20:56.030 --> 01:20:56.040 align:start position:0%
the documentation of their age perhaps
 
01:20:58.729 --> 01:20:58.739 align:start position:0%
with the human trafficking idea is
 
01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:01.500 align:start position:0%
actually a legal document unless you can
 
01:21:04.189 --> 01:21:04.199 align:start position:0%
touch and feel that document I do have a
 
01:21:06.890 --> 01:21:06.900 align:start position:0%
concern about the human trafficking and
 
01:21:10.010 --> 01:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
about the young people being forced into
 
01:21:12.649 --> 01:21:12.659 align:start position:0%
marriage and it would be a lot easier to
 
01:21:14.330 --> 01:21:14.340 align:start position:0%
be forced into marriage if you were
 
01:21:17.270 --> 01:21:17.280 align:start position:0%
doing it electronically as opposed to
 
01:21:21.050 --> 01:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
physically being able to come in I know
 
01:21:24.290 --> 01:21:24.300 align:start position:0%
we like to think that New Hampshire is
 
01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:25.010 align:start position:0%
we like to think that New Hampshire is
um

01:21:25.010 --> 01:21:25.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:21:27.350 --> 01:21:27.360 align:start position:0%
this doesn't happen in New Hampshire but
 
01:21:30.649 --> 01:21:30.659 align:start position:0%
it does and I I would like to reiterate
 
01:21:34.490 --> 01:21:34.500 align:start position:0%
my concern about the vagueness and of a
 
01:21:37.490 --> 01:21:37.500 align:start position:0%
medical reason and if a doctor gives me
 
01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:41.520 align:start position:0%
a note that says I have asthma and I
 
01:21:43.550 --> 01:21:43.560 align:start position:0%
tell the town clerk I can't come in
 
01:21:46.130 --> 01:21:46.140 align:start position:0%
because of that I would think it would
 
01:21:50.870 --> 01:21:50.880 align:start position:0%
be hard-pressed for a town clerk to try
 
01:21:50.880 --> 01:21:52.250 align:start position:0%
be hard-pressed for a town clerk to try
to

01:21:52.250 --> 01:21:52.260 align:start position:0%
to
 
01:21:55.250 --> 01:21:55.260 align:start position:0%
say well I'm not accepting that I would
 
01:21:57.350 --> 01:21:57.360 align:start position:0%
think that would put the town clerk in a
 
01:22:03.530 --> 01:22:03.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:06.890 --> 01:22:06.900 align:start position:0%
other questions for the senator
 
01:22:08.630 --> 01:22:08.640 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much Senator
 
01:22:14.570 --> 01:22:14.580 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:16.189 --> 01:22:16.199 align:start position:0%
I'm sorry is there anyone else that
 
01:22:22.130 --> 01:22:22.140 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:23.870 --> 01:22:23.880 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
01:22:28.070 --> 01:22:28.080 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:33.229 --> 01:22:33.239 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:41.030 --> 01:22:41.040 align:start position:0%
 
01:22:43.610 --> 01:22:43.620 align:start position:0%
Senator you know what you might Senator
 
01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:45.600 align:start position:0%
gray is coming back in just a few
 
01:22:48.169 --> 01:22:48.179 align:start position:0%
minutes on the next bill so we can we
 
01:22:51.110 --> 01:22:51.120 align:start position:0%
can ask him or you can ask him
 
01:31:56.810 --> 01:31:56.820 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:00.950 --> 01:32:00.960 align:start position:0%
so so now you're early all right so
 
01:32:03.169 --> 01:32:03.179 align:start position:0%
um I'm going to uh
 
01:32:07.550 --> 01:32:07.560 align:start position:0%
open the hearing on uh Senate Bill uh 92
 
01:32:12.649 --> 01:32:12.659 align:start position:0%
and uh recognize the uh Prime sponsor of
 
01:32:14.689 --> 01:32:14.699 align:start position:0%
Senator gray and just Senator before we
 
01:32:16.129 --> 01:32:16.139 align:start position:0%
get to that can I just ask you I know
 
01:32:17.450 --> 01:32:17.460 align:start position:0%
that you we know that you would just
 
01:32:20.570 --> 01:32:20.580 align:start position:0%
talked with Senator bird cell uh is can
 
01:32:22.910 --> 01:32:22.920 align:start position:0%
we make the amendment from Shell to May
 
01:32:25.550 --> 01:32:25.560 align:start position:0%
and that other bill that we talked about
 
01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:29.159 align:start position:0%
um it is your bill and your committee is
 
01:32:32.030 --> 01:32:32.040 align:start position:0%
uh you know got the authority to do
 
01:32:33.709 --> 01:32:33.719 align:start position:0%
anything you want with it
 
01:32:36.470 --> 01:32:36.480 align:start position:0%
uh certainly I don't have any objection
 
01:32:38.870 --> 01:32:38.880 align:start position:0%
uh the way that Senator bird cell
 
01:32:41.330 --> 01:32:41.340 align:start position:0%
described it to me but uh of course
 
01:32:43.010 --> 01:32:43.020 align:start position:0%
walking down the hall from the elevator
 
01:32:45.050 --> 01:32:45.060 align:start position:0%
to here wasn't much time to think about
 
01:32:47.890 --> 01:32:47.900 align:start position:0%
how I worded it in the first place so
 
01:32:54.050 --> 01:32:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:32:58.129 --> 01:32:58.139 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:00.770 --> 01:33:00.780 align:start position:0%
if I went again
 
01:33:02.570 --> 01:33:02.580 align:start position:0%
you know if that's what your committee
 
01:33:04.750 --> 01:33:04.760 align:start position:0%
decides that needs to happen then
 
01:33:08.270 --> 01:33:08.280 align:start position:0%
certainly we'll uh look at it without
 
01:33:10.450 --> 01:33:10.460 align:start position:0%
going back to my notes
 
01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:15.300 align:start position:0%
on the the bill and seeing why I put in
 
01:33:18.229 --> 01:33:18.239 align:start position:0%
the words that we did
 
01:33:20.390 --> 01:33:20.400 align:start position:0%
um I can't really tell you no you know
 
01:33:22.910 --> 01:33:22.920 align:start position:0%
it's uh
 
01:33:26.149 --> 01:33:26.159 align:start position:0%
well but I must have agreed with it if
 
01:33:34.310 --> 01:33:34.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:33:37.729 --> 01:33:37.739 align:start position:0%
the power is that right
 
01:33:37.739 --> 01:33:39.470 align:start position:0%
the power is that right
well

01:33:39.470 --> 01:33:39.480 align:start position:0%
well
 
01:33:42.169 --> 01:33:42.179 align:start position:0%
all right knowing knowing what happened
 
01:33:44.149 --> 01:33:44.159 align:start position:0%
with all of those votes
 
01:33:48.010 --> 01:33:48.020 align:start position:0%
there were very few votes that uh
 
01:33:51.970 --> 01:33:51.980 align:start position:0%
well for for election law
 
01:33:55.189 --> 01:33:55.199 align:start position:0%
we pride ourselves on having unanimous
 
01:33:58.550 --> 01:33:58.560 align:start position:0%
votes either for or against and there
 
01:34:02.390 --> 01:34:02.400 align:start position:0%
are very few bills that we disagree on
 
01:34:06.709 --> 01:34:06.719 align:start position:0%
enough that there are
 
01:34:09.890 --> 01:34:09.900 align:start position:0%
you know even by partisan or bipartisan
 
01:34:13.870 --> 01:34:13.880 align:start position:0%
uh problems with so
 
01:34:18.470 --> 01:34:18.480 align:start position:0%
I understand I understand that and
 
01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:24.830 align:start position:0%
I understand I understand that and
and

01:34:24.830 --> 01:34:24.840 align:start position:0%
 
01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:28.739 align:start position:0%
right now I'm I'm not at uh don't have
 
01:34:30.649 --> 01:34:30.659 align:start position:0%
the ability to comment any further on
 
01:34:32.390 --> 01:34:32.400 align:start position:0%
that right now because I just don't have
 
01:34:34.250 --> 01:34:34.260 align:start position:0%
the records
 
01:34:36.110 --> 01:34:36.120 align:start position:0%
we'll find it out in the committee
 
01:34:37.850 --> 01:34:37.860 align:start position:0%
conference process we'll take as long as
 
01:34:41.330 --> 01:34:41.340 align:start position:0%
we need all right so let's let's turn
 
01:34:45.490 --> 01:34:45.500 align:start position:0%
out to uh Senator Bill 92 and Senator uh
 
01:34:49.430 --> 01:34:49.440 align:start position:0%
my name is James Gray I represent Senate
 
01:34:51.649 --> 01:34:51.659 align:start position:0%
District number six which starts up in
 
01:34:54.290 --> 01:34:54.300 align:start position:0%
Alton and Gilmanton uh comes down Route
 
01:34:55.689 --> 01:34:55.699 align:start position:0%
11 to Rochester
 
01:34:59.149 --> 01:34:59.159 align:start position:0%
uh registers of probate a wonderful
 
01:35:03.229 --> 01:35:03.239 align:start position:0%
thing I have been arguing over registers
 
01:35:05.390 --> 01:35:05.400 align:start position:0%
of probate for years and years and years
 
01:35:07.910 --> 01:35:07.920 align:start position:0%
in fact it it started back when I was a
 
01:35:10.250 --> 01:35:10.260 align:start position:0%
member of the house uh when we were
 
01:35:14.030 --> 01:35:14.040 align:start position:0%
doing all of the register of probates
 
01:35:17.629 --> 01:35:17.639 align:start position:0%
um the bill that's in front of you uh
 
01:35:20.709 --> 01:35:20.719 align:start position:0%
the main thing that it does is it gives
 
01:35:24.830 --> 01:35:24.840 align:start position:0%
your constituents a place to go and talk
 
01:35:28.189 --> 01:35:28.199 align:start position:0%
to the same person uh when they they
 
01:35:30.410 --> 01:35:30.420 align:start position:0%
want to discuss this register of probate
 
01:35:35.090 --> 01:35:35.100 align:start position:0%
stuff uh it uh takes advantage of one of
 
01:35:37.490 --> 01:35:37.500 align:start position:0%
the things that the court was going to
 
01:35:37.500 --> 01:35:38.990 align:start position:0%
the things that the court was going to
do

01:35:38.990 --> 01:35:39.000 align:start position:0%
do
 
01:35:41.470 --> 01:35:41.480 align:start position:0%
um on the Navigator program
 
01:35:45.010 --> 01:35:45.020 align:start position:0%
so that the people will be knowledgeable
 
01:35:49.970 --> 01:35:49.980 align:start position:0%
again it is not you know endorsed by the
 
01:35:52.910 --> 01:35:52.920 align:start position:0%
courts but unless I say the wrong thing
 
01:35:55.370 --> 01:35:55.380 align:start position:0%
I don't even believe you'll get a card
 
01:35:57.110 --> 01:35:57.120 align:start position:0%
from the courts
 
01:35:59.930 --> 01:35:59.940 align:start position:0%
so that you can take what inference you
 
01:36:02.629 --> 01:36:02.639 align:start position:0%
want from that
 
01:36:05.390 --> 01:36:05.400 align:start position:0%
they do not support it
 
01:36:08.390 --> 01:36:08.400 align:start position:0%
so I'll leave it at that
 
01:36:10.370 --> 01:36:10.380 align:start position:0%
but when you look at the data that we've
 
01:36:13.129 --> 01:36:13.139 align:start position:0%
collected over the years there was an
 
01:36:15.890 --> 01:36:15.900 align:start position:0%
average of about seven calls per probate
 
01:36:15.900 --> 01:36:17.110 align:start position:0%
average of about seven calls per probate
case

01:36:17.110 --> 01:36:17.120 align:start position:0%
case
 
01:36:19.450 --> 01:36:19.460 align:start position:0%
to their call center
 
01:36:23.229 --> 01:36:23.239 align:start position:0%
which to me especially if you have
 
01:36:26.810 --> 01:36:26.820 align:start position:0%
attorneys and paralegals that are
 
01:36:29.689 --> 01:36:29.699 align:start position:0%
processing a lot of this they should not
 
01:36:33.229 --> 01:36:33.239 align:start position:0%
need anywhere near seven calls to their
 
01:36:36.649 --> 01:36:36.659 align:start position:0%
hotline to to take care of a
 
01:36:40.790 --> 01:36:40.800 align:start position:0%
in my own experience when my son passed
 
01:36:43.970 --> 01:36:43.980 align:start position:0%
away and my daughter-in-law she didn't
 
01:36:46.850 --> 01:36:46.860 align:start position:0%
come to me she went to the attorney it
 
01:36:48.530 --> 01:36:48.540 align:start position:0%
cost her a thousand seven hundred
 
01:36:48.540 --> 01:36:49.550 align:start position:0%
cost her a thousand seven hundred
dollars

01:36:49.550 --> 01:36:49.560 align:start position:0%
dollars
 
01:36:53.350 --> 01:36:53.360 align:start position:0%
in attorney fees to change
 
01:36:57.590 --> 01:36:57.600 align:start position:0%
the trust documents that they had and
 
01:37:00.770 --> 01:37:00.780 align:start position:0%
take the things through probate and
 
01:37:03.410 --> 01:37:03.420 align:start position:0%
because of the trust it was really only
 
01:37:05.390 --> 01:37:05.400 align:start position:0%
one car that uh
 
01:37:08.750 --> 01:37:08.760 align:start position:0%
you know I had a nominal value in one
 
01:37:11.810 --> 01:37:11.820 align:start position:0%
bank account so that the register of
 
01:37:13.790 --> 01:37:13.800 align:start position:0%
probate stuff should not have been very
 
01:37:16.430 --> 01:37:16.440 align:start position:0%
very high again when trying to get the
 
01:37:18.430 --> 01:37:18.440 align:start position:0%
government down to where the people are
 
01:37:20.629 --> 01:37:20.639 align:start position:0%
one of the complaints that I was
 
01:37:23.209 --> 01:37:23.219 align:start position:0%
receiving was that every time I called
 
01:37:26.270 --> 01:37:26.280 align:start position:0%
the the line I get a different person
 
01:37:28.030 --> 01:37:28.040 align:start position:0%
and I have to start from the beginning
 
01:37:31.490 --> 01:37:31.500 align:start position:0%
explaining what's going on utilizing
 
01:37:33.550 --> 01:37:33.560 align:start position:0%
register of probates
 
01:37:33.560 --> 01:37:35.350 align:start position:0%
register of probates
ability

01:37:35.350 --> 01:37:35.360 align:start position:0%
ability
 
01:37:40.610 --> 01:37:40.620 align:start position:0%
to provide not legal assistance but you
 
01:37:42.830 --> 01:37:42.840 align:start position:0%
know answer questions about process and
 
01:37:47.270 --> 01:37:47.280 align:start position:0%
things will be advantageous
 
01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:49.310 align:start position:0%
things will be advantageous
and

01:37:49.310 --> 01:37:49.320 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:37:52.550 --> 01:37:52.560 align:start position:0%
with that I'll answer any questions and
 
01:37:54.770 --> 01:37:54.780 align:start position:0%
you'll know if I said anything wrong
 
01:37:56.750 --> 01:37:56.760 align:start position:0%
because you'll get a card that you don't
 
01:37:58.010 --> 01:37:58.020 align:start position:0%
have now
 
01:38:00.770 --> 01:38:00.780 align:start position:0%
I have questions for this week yes
 
01:38:03.229 --> 01:38:03.239 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you thanks
 
01:38:05.270 --> 01:38:05.280 align:start position:0%
for taking my question a little bit of
 
01:38:08.270 --> 01:38:08.280 align:start position:0%
history for me I'm I'm a freshman
 
01:38:10.610 --> 01:38:10.620 align:start position:0%
um so it's my understanding that each
 
01:38:13.310 --> 01:38:13.320 align:start position:0%
County had a register of probate and
 
01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
that was eliminated by they have a
 
01:38:19.310 --> 01:38:19.320 align:start position:0%
register of probate
 
01:38:22.310 --> 01:38:22.320 align:start position:0%
you you use the past tense right now
 
01:38:25.610 --> 01:38:25.620 align:start position:0%
they have one okay they don't do a lot
 
01:38:28.010 --> 01:38:28.020 align:start position:0%
but they have one right that's like a
 
01:38:29.689 --> 01:38:29.699 align:start position:0%
hundred dollar a year position I believe
 
01:38:32.510 --> 01:38:32.520 align:start position:0%
now same as you yeah
 
01:38:34.610 --> 01:38:34.620 align:start position:0%
but no Benny's like I have
 
01:38:34.620 --> 01:38:36.050 align:start position:0%
but no Benny's like I have
um

01:38:36.050 --> 01:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:39.410 --> 01:38:39.420 align:start position:0%
and that was basically uh at one time
 
01:38:41.750 --> 01:38:41.760 align:start position:0%
they did everything that the magistrates
 
01:38:44.450 --> 01:38:44.460 align:start position:0%
are doing now is that correct if you
 
01:38:47.330 --> 01:38:47.340 align:start position:0%
look into article
 
01:38:50.450 --> 01:38:50.460 align:start position:0%
think it's like 81 part second of the
 
01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:52.310 align:start position:0%
think it's like 81 part second of the
Constitution

01:38:52.310 --> 01:38:52.320 align:start position:0%
Constitution
 
01:38:52.320 --> 01:38:53.050 align:start position:0%
Constitution
um

01:38:53.050 --> 01:38:53.060 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:38:57.229 --> 01:38:57.239 align:start position:0%
it speaks to that the courts can appoint
 
01:38:59.450 --> 01:38:59.460 align:start position:0%
the clerks of the Court except for
 
01:39:02.390 --> 01:39:02.400 align:start position:0%
probate okay okay and so that when we
 
01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:04.129 align:start position:0%
probate okay okay and so that when we
changed

01:39:04.129 --> 01:39:04.139 align:start position:0%
changed
 
01:39:08.629 --> 01:39:08.639 align:start position:0%
um back in uh 2010-11 whatever the
 
01:39:10.970 --> 01:39:10.980 align:start position:0%
actual time is
 
01:39:13.490 --> 01:39:13.500 align:start position:0%
um we pretty much did away with the
 
01:39:15.830 --> 01:39:15.840 align:start position:0%
Probate Court put them under
 
01:39:19.669 --> 01:39:19.679 align:start position:0%
you know and and so those changes uh
 
01:39:19.679 --> 01:39:21.350 align:start position:0%
you know and and so those changes uh
eliminated

01:39:21.350 --> 01:39:21.360 align:start position:0%
eliminated
 
01:39:24.470 --> 01:39:24.480 align:start position:0%
all of the duties uh except for one or
 
01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:25.790 align:start position:0%
all of the duties uh except for one or
two

01:39:25.790 --> 01:39:25.800 align:start position:0%
two
 
01:39:27.470 --> 01:39:27.480 align:start position:0%
um that the register of probate had
 
01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:29.689 align:start position:0%
um that the register of probate had
statutorily

01:39:29.689 --> 01:39:29.699 align:start position:0%
statutorily
 
01:39:33.350 --> 01:39:33.360 align:start position:0%
and based on that information it's my
 
01:39:34.790 --> 01:39:34.800 align:start position:0%
understanding I mean I have a friend
 
01:39:37.189 --> 01:39:37.199 align:start position:0%
who's it's costing six thousand dollars
 
01:39:39.430 --> 01:39:39.440 align:start position:0%
and it's going on for six months to
 
01:39:41.390 --> 01:39:41.400 align:start position:0%
straighten out
 
01:39:41.400 --> 01:39:42.850 align:start position:0%
straighten out
probate

01:39:42.850 --> 01:39:42.860 align:start position:0%
probate
 
01:39:47.090 --> 01:39:47.100 align:start position:0%
so this would have that person in each
 
01:39:51.950 --> 01:39:51.960 align:start position:0%
in each County now be the point person
 
01:39:54.709 --> 01:39:54.719 align:start position:0%
for probate
 
01:39:56.750 --> 01:39:56.760 align:start position:0%
um I I would step back from the point
 
01:40:00.290 --> 01:40:00.300 align:start position:0%
person I would say a resource that is
 
01:40:03.229 --> 01:40:03.239 align:start position:0%
available to the those persons okay
 
01:40:05.990 --> 01:40:06.000 align:start position:0%
again there's nothing in this bill that
 
01:40:07.729 --> 01:40:07.739 align:start position:0%
says you have to go to the register of
 
01:40:10.490 --> 01:40:10.500 align:start position:0%
probate there's nothing in there but
 
01:40:12.709 --> 01:40:12.719 align:start position:0%
anyone who tries to go through the
 
01:40:16.430 --> 01:40:16.440 align:start position:0%
process per se and navigate the computer
 
01:40:19.010 --> 01:40:19.020 align:start position:0%
system that's in the court
 
01:40:19.020 --> 01:40:19.550 align:start position:0%
system that's in the court
um

01:40:19.550 --> 01:40:19.560 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:21.830 --> 01:40:21.840 align:start position:0%
you know judge king did some videos
 
01:40:26.750 --> 01:40:26.760 align:start position:0%
about how to uh to navigate the system
 
01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:27.470 align:start position:0%
about how to uh to navigate the system
um

01:40:27.470 --> 01:40:27.480 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:40:27.480 --> 01:40:28.850 align:start position:0%
um
but

01:40:28.850 --> 01:40:28.860 align:start position:0%
but
 
01:40:31.450 --> 01:40:31.460 align:start position:0%
I believe that having that that person
 
01:40:35.090 --> 01:40:35.100 align:start position:0%
in each County that the the person can
 
01:40:38.030 --> 01:40:38.040 align:start position:0%
go to uh again not for legal advice
 
01:40:40.129 --> 01:40:40.139 align:start position:0%
because they're this person's not going
 
01:40:43.010 --> 01:40:43.020 align:start position:0%
to provide any legal advice but you know
 
01:40:45.590 --> 01:40:45.600 align:start position:0%
what do you put in box 3A what do you
 
01:40:47.570 --> 01:40:47.580 align:start position:0%
put in box seven
 
01:40:50.030 --> 01:40:50.040 align:start position:0%
um you know what kind of things do I
 
01:40:54.050 --> 01:40:54.060 align:start position:0%
have to include in my uh
 
01:40:54.060 --> 01:40:58.310 align:start position:0%
have to include in my uh
uh

01:40:58.310 --> 01:40:58.320 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:01.610 --> 01:41:01.620 align:start position:0%
property statements you know about what
 
01:41:04.970 --> 01:41:04.980 align:start position:0%
the assets of the the thing are in those
 
01:41:07.850 --> 01:41:07.860 align:start position:0%
things because you know defining the
 
01:41:11.350 --> 01:41:11.360 align:start position:0%
assets defining uh you know who the the
 
01:41:14.229 --> 01:41:14.239 align:start position:0%
executor is all those things
 
01:41:18.350 --> 01:41:18.360 align:start position:0%
there are procedures to those uh and
 
01:41:21.950 --> 01:41:21.960 align:start position:0%
there are also legal consequences uh to
 
01:41:23.990 --> 01:41:24.000 align:start position:0%
making those choices this person would
 
01:41:26.689 --> 01:41:26.699 align:start position:0%
not be able to to weigh in on what the
 
01:41:30.709 --> 01:41:30.719 align:start position:0%
legal ramifications are but you know
 
01:41:33.110 --> 01:41:33.120 align:start position:0%
where do I put that name of that person
 
01:41:35.209 --> 01:41:35.219 align:start position:0%
that I want as the executor in the
 
01:41:37.609 --> 01:41:37.619 align:start position:0%
computer and how do I do it they'd be
 
01:41:39.350 --> 01:41:39.360 align:start position:0%
able to do that thank you that's how I
 
01:41:40.970 --> 01:41:40.980 align:start position:0%
thought I understood it but I wanted to
 
01:41:43.310 --> 01:41:43.320 align:start position:0%
clarify it thank you
 
01:41:44.870 --> 01:41:44.880 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness
 
01:41:47.149 --> 01:41:47.159 align:start position:0%
representative Meadows
 
01:41:48.770 --> 01:41:48.780 align:start position:0%
so chair and thank you for taking my
 
01:41:48.780 --> 01:41:50.870 align:start position:0%
so chair and thank you for taking my
course

01:41:50.870 --> 01:41:50.880 align:start position:0%
course
 
01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:54.050 align:start position:0%
course
[Music]

01:41:54.050 --> 01:41:54.060 align:start position:0%
 
01:41:56.689 --> 01:41:56.699 align:start position:0%
the Registrar of probate did not take
 
01:41:59.689 --> 01:41:59.699 align:start position:0%
the Navigator training then they would
 
01:42:01.970 --> 01:42:01.980 align:start position:0%
essentially be be certified and the
 
01:42:03.950 --> 01:42:03.960 align:start position:0%
position declared vacant
 
01:42:06.770 --> 01:42:06.780 align:start position:0%
is that am I correct in understanding
 
01:42:08.930 --> 01:42:08.940 align:start position:0%
the the bill that way those are the
 
01:42:11.510 --> 01:42:11.520 align:start position:0%
words that I put in over the years there
 
01:42:14.570 --> 01:42:14.580 align:start position:0%
have been concerns that the register of
 
01:42:17.169 --> 01:42:17.179 align:start position:0%
probate has no qualifications
 
01:42:20.930 --> 01:42:20.940 align:start position:0%
no uh you know why would I have a
 
01:42:22.430 --> 01:42:22.440 align:start position:0%
register of probate that doesn't know
 
01:42:25.450 --> 01:42:25.460 align:start position:0%
anything about probate so the court
 
01:42:29.030 --> 01:42:29.040 align:start position:0%
independent of this bill has talked
 
01:42:32.350 --> 01:42:32.360 align:start position:0%
about this Navigator program that would
 
01:42:35.930 --> 01:42:35.940 align:start position:0%
train volunteers to be able to assist
 
01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:37.030 align:start position:0%
train volunteers to be able to assist
people

01:42:37.030 --> 01:42:37.040 align:start position:0%
people
 
01:42:39.350 --> 01:42:39.360 align:start position:0%
you know this is one of the few things
 
01:42:42.229 --> 01:42:42.239 align:start position:0%
that you go to the court system and it's
 
01:42:45.169 --> 01:42:45.179 align:start position:0%
neither a criminal nor a civil thing you
 
01:42:46.970 --> 01:42:46.980 align:start position:0%
know that you're trying you know that
 
01:42:49.970 --> 01:42:49.980 align:start position:0%
you're you have violated you know it's
 
01:42:52.189 --> 01:42:52.199 align:start position:0%
one of those things that uh
 
01:42:54.770 --> 01:42:54.780 align:start position:0%
uh you know
 
01:42:57.050 --> 01:42:57.060 align:start position:0%
the only thing that the person did to
 
01:42:59.270 --> 01:42:59.280 align:start position:0%
get there is they had one of their close
 
01:43:03.109 --> 01:43:03.119 align:start position:0%
 
01:43:05.090 --> 01:43:05.100 align:start position:0%
are there questions for this witness yes
 
01:43:07.370 --> 01:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
representative Horgan
 
01:43:09.770 --> 01:43:09.780 align:start position:0%
thank you very much um
 
01:43:12.890 --> 01:43:12.900 align:start position:0%
a question about Article 5 of um
 
01:43:15.169 --> 01:43:15.179 align:start position:0%
time of filling the um filling the
 
01:43:16.910 --> 01:43:16.920 align:start position:0%
vacancy and refers back to article two
 
01:43:19.010 --> 01:43:19.020 align:start position:0%
of this bill but that um
 
01:43:19.020 --> 01:43:20.510 align:start position:0%
of this bill but that um
only

01:43:20.510 --> 01:43:20.520 align:start position:0%
only
 
01:43:23.510 --> 01:43:23.520 align:start position:0%
covers the requirement that uh
 
01:43:27.229 --> 01:43:27.239 align:start position:0%
register the elected candidate must uh
 
01:43:29.570 --> 01:43:29.580 align:start position:0%
must be part of the probate Navigator
 
01:43:32.629 --> 01:43:32.639 align:start position:0%
program and um I think there's also an
 
01:43:34.310 --> 01:43:34.320 align:start position:0%
additional requirement
 
01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:36.119 align:start position:0%
there's already a requirement if I
 
01:43:37.970 --> 01:43:37.980 align:start position:0%
remember correctly that the registered
 
01:43:39.890 --> 01:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
probate must live in the county that he
 
01:43:42.649 --> 01:43:42.659 align:start position:0%
or she represents even though they're
 
01:43:44.149 --> 01:43:44.159 align:start position:0%
actually officially considered part of
 
01:43:46.850 --> 01:43:46.860 align:start position:0%
the state government rather than the
 
01:43:49.010 --> 01:43:49.020 align:start position:0%
County government so is there
 
01:43:52.070 --> 01:43:52.080 align:start position:0%
is that is there sort of an ambiguity in
 
01:43:55.070 --> 01:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
this law about uh
 
01:43:56.570 --> 01:43:56.580 align:start position:0%
just about like since it doesn't
 
01:43:58.129 --> 01:43:58.139 align:start position:0%
actually explicitly say the positioning
 
01:43:59.870 --> 01:43:59.880 align:start position:0%
becomes vacant
 
01:44:02.209 --> 01:44:02.219 align:start position:0%
um so is that possibly something that
 
01:44:03.530 --> 01:44:03.540 align:start position:0%
needs to be uh
 
01:44:06.109 --> 01:44:06.119 align:start position:0%
we need a little bit more complicate a
 
01:44:08.810 --> 01:44:08.820 align:start position:0%
little bit more clear in the uh we did
 
01:44:11.450 --> 01:44:11.460 align:start position:0%
not believe that we needed to go in and
 
01:44:14.629 --> 01:44:14.639 align:start position:0%
you know specify you know that the other
 
01:44:17.450 --> 01:44:17.460 align:start position:0%
things that are that are in law
 
01:44:21.410 --> 01:44:21.420 align:start position:0%
um that right now uh the sheriffs all
 
01:44:24.590 --> 01:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
have to live in the county uh you know
 
01:44:28.550 --> 01:44:28.560 align:start position:0%
the register of uh Deeds has to live in
 
01:44:30.229 --> 01:44:30.239 align:start position:0%
the county the treasurer has to live in
 
01:44:31.490 --> 01:44:31.500 align:start position:0%
the county
 
01:44:33.410 --> 01:44:33.420 align:start position:0%
um and I don't know of any place in the
 
01:44:35.870 --> 01:44:35.880 align:start position:0%
statute that that you know we go in and
 
01:44:39.470 --> 01:44:39.480 align:start position:0%
spell that out this was uh the County
 
01:44:43.250 --> 01:44:43.260 align:start position:0%
Attorney uh you know has to be a lawyer
 
01:44:43.260 --> 01:44:44.350 align:start position:0%
Attorney uh you know has to be a lawyer
okay

01:44:44.350 --> 01:44:44.360 align:start position:0%
okay
 
01:44:48.169 --> 01:44:48.179 align:start position:0%
but again we don't also say in that same
 
01:44:51.229 --> 01:44:51.239 align:start position:0%
statute as best I can remember that they
 
01:44:55.129 --> 01:44:55.139 align:start position:0%
but as part of filing for that position
 
01:44:58.070 --> 01:44:58.080 align:start position:0%
there are requirements on whether they
 
01:44:59.990 --> 01:45:00.000 align:start position:0%
can file or not and that is their
 
01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.450 align:start position:0%
can file or not and that is their
residence

01:45:02.450 --> 01:45:02.460 align:start position:0%
residence
 
01:45:04.790 --> 01:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
well this little I don't know more of a
 
01:45:06.830 --> 01:45:06.840 align:start position:0%
question to come and I think we I don't
 
01:45:07.910 --> 01:45:07.920 align:start position:0%
remember the details but I think there
 
01:45:10.250 --> 01:45:10.260 align:start position:0%
was a controversy over elected County
 
01:45:12.109 --> 01:45:12.119 align:start position:0%
attorney about whether or not
 
01:45:14.149 --> 01:45:14.159 align:start position:0%
he was actually a member of the bar but
 
01:45:17.330 --> 01:45:17.340 align:start position:0%
I guess he ended up but um
 
01:45:19.250 --> 01:45:19.260 align:start position:0%
it's a little bit but isn't a little bit
 
01:45:21.470 --> 01:45:21.480 align:start position:0%
different in that there is no probate
 
01:45:23.270 --> 01:45:23.280 align:start position:0%
office within County government unlike
 
01:45:25.609 --> 01:45:25.619 align:start position:0%
the registered Deeds has heads
 
01:45:27.350 --> 01:45:27.360 align:start position:0%
registered Deeds heads or Register of
 
01:45:29.570 --> 01:45:29.580 align:start position:0%
Deeds office and the sheriff you know
 
01:45:32.030 --> 01:45:32.040 align:start position:0%
has the sheriff's department but it's a
 
01:45:33.890 --> 01:45:33.900 align:start position:0%
little bit different because there is no
 
01:45:37.609 --> 01:45:37.619 align:start position:0%
longer any uh registry of probate uh
 
01:45:39.590 --> 01:45:39.600 align:start position:0%
Department under state government and
 
01:45:40.850 --> 01:45:40.860 align:start position:0%
also of course
 
01:45:42.590 --> 01:45:42.600 align:start position:0%
they're attached to the Circuit Courts
 
01:45:43.850 --> 01:45:43.860 align:start position:0%
which are now like part of state
 
01:45:45.290 --> 01:45:45.300 align:start position:0%
government rather than County government
 
01:45:47.570 --> 01:45:47.580 align:start position:0%
I think
 
01:45:49.850 --> 01:45:49.860 align:start position:0%
um again you know what we tried to do in
 
01:45:53.990 --> 01:45:54.000 align:start position:0%
here is do the minimum try to make that
 
01:45:57.050 --> 01:45:57.060 align:start position:0%
asset available uh if you live in
 
01:46:01.129 --> 01:46:01.139 align:start position:0%
northern Stratford County uh you know
 
01:46:05.689 --> 01:46:05.699 align:start position:0%
and the register of uh probate you know
 
01:46:08.930 --> 01:46:08.940 align:start position:0%
agrees to meet you at the uh the Dunkin
 
01:46:11.229 --> 01:46:11.239 align:start position:0%
Donuts you know at the Mobile station
 
01:46:15.709 --> 01:46:15.719 align:start position:0%
that's fine with me the no need that
 
01:46:18.350 --> 01:46:18.360 align:start position:0%
there be a a particular office we took
 
01:46:20.689 --> 01:46:20.699 align:start position:0%
all of that out which was in Prior bills
 
01:46:23.390 --> 01:46:23.400 align:start position:0%
we took out the computers we took out
 
01:46:25.310 --> 01:46:25.320 align:start position:0%
the phones we took out all of those
 
01:46:29.390 --> 01:46:29.400 align:start position:0%
things that were found objectionable and
 
01:46:32.450 --> 01:46:32.460 align:start position:0%
now we have the Navigator program which
 
01:46:35.590 --> 01:46:35.600 align:start position:0%
is independent of this bill so
 
01:46:39.229 --> 01:46:39.239 align:start position:0%
but I'm trying to use that to satisfy
 
01:46:42.649 --> 01:46:42.659 align:start position:0%
another requirement that I've heard from
 
01:46:46.010 --> 01:46:46.020 align:start position:0%
the legislators in the past is that this
 
01:46:49.370 --> 01:46:49.380 align:start position:0%
person needs to have knowledge of the
 
01:46:51.770 --> 01:46:51.780 align:start position:0%
probate system and
 
01:46:55.189 --> 01:46:55.199 align:start position:0%
since the Navigator is going to go
 
01:46:58.430 --> 01:46:58.440 align:start position:0%
through a a training program that would
 
01:47:01.129 --> 01:47:01.139 align:start position:0%
tell them you know that information or
 
01:47:03.010 --> 01:47:03.020 align:start position:0%
teach them that information
 
01:47:07.010 --> 01:47:07.020 align:start position:0%
we're happy to help assist the court
 
01:47:10.970 --> 01:47:10.980 align:start position:0%
system and and having some people and at
 
01:47:13.310 --> 01:47:13.320 align:start position:0%
least one person in each County that
 
01:47:16.189 --> 01:47:16.199 align:start position:0%
applies for this position to assist them
 
01:47:18.770 --> 01:47:18.780 align:start position:0%
in that mission
 
01:47:21.169 --> 01:47:21.179 align:start position:0%
representative kuta
 
01:47:23.450 --> 01:47:23.460 align:start position:0%
so is this bill just offering that a
 
01:47:26.030 --> 01:47:26.040 align:start position:0%
register of probate may do these things
 
01:47:28.070 --> 01:47:28.080 align:start position:0%
if they want to I just I want to clarify
 
01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:29.219 align:start position:0%
because we're stating that we're not
 
01:47:31.010 --> 01:47:31.020 align:start position:0%
providing them with an office a phone or
 
01:47:32.870 --> 01:47:32.880 align:start position:0%
computer or anything of that nature so
 
01:47:34.609 --> 01:47:34.619 align:start position:0%
if they just choose that they don't want
 
01:47:36.470 --> 01:47:36.480 align:start position:0%
to do anything they could just choose
 
01:47:38.930 --> 01:47:38.940 align:start position:0%
not to take the calls or not to respond
 
01:47:40.370 --> 01:47:40.380 align:start position:0%
to people or help people if they wanted
 
01:47:43.430 --> 01:47:43.440 align:start position:0%
to is that correct part of what
 
01:47:46.370 --> 01:47:46.380 align:start position:0%
I put in here is trying to get to the
 
01:47:49.310 --> 01:47:49.320 align:start position:0%
point where this person has demonstrated
 
01:47:53.570 --> 01:47:53.580 align:start position:0%
that they want to help by going through
 
01:47:55.209 --> 01:47:55.219 align:start position:0%
this Navigator program
 
01:47:58.790 --> 01:47:58.800 align:start position:0%
so that in itself is a demonstration
 
01:48:01.930 --> 01:48:01.940 align:start position:0%
that they are trying to provide this
 
01:48:05.030 --> 01:48:05.040 align:start position:0%
certainly you as the voter in your
 
01:48:09.590 --> 01:48:09.600 align:start position:0%
county will have the final say if if a
 
01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:11.360 align:start position:0%
person is
 
01:48:14.870 --> 01:48:14.880 align:start position:0%
fulfilling that requirement
 
01:48:17.209 --> 01:48:17.219 align:start position:0%
every two years
 
01:48:19.729 --> 01:48:19.739 align:start position:0%
thank you representative Alexander thank
 
01:48:20.870 --> 01:48:20.880 align:start position:0%
you Mr chair
 
01:48:22.550 --> 01:48:22.560 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question
 
01:48:25.070 --> 01:48:25.080 align:start position:0%
Senator my my concern with this is just
 
01:48:27.410 --> 01:48:27.420 align:start position:0%
the online 22 of the bill that says
 
01:48:28.790 --> 01:48:28.800 align:start position:0%
failure to continue to participate in
 
01:48:30.649 --> 01:48:30.659 align:start position:0%
the program throughout the term child
 
01:48:32.450 --> 01:48:32.460 align:start position:0%
disqualify the person to be a candidate
 
01:48:33.709 --> 01:48:33.719 align:start position:0%
for register probate the next election
 
01:48:36.470 --> 01:48:36.480 align:start position:0%
do you feel that that could be like a
 
01:48:38.270 --> 01:48:38.280 align:start position:0%
constitutional violation of somebody
 
01:48:40.790 --> 01:48:40.800 align:start position:0%
running so the voters elect a registered
 
01:48:42.530 --> 01:48:42.540 align:start position:0%
probate they're satisfied with the job
 
01:48:44.390 --> 01:48:44.400 align:start position:0%
they're doing and then because they
 
01:48:45.770 --> 01:48:45.780 align:start position:0%
don't participate in this one program
 
01:48:47.930 --> 01:48:47.940 align:start position:0%
they're disqualified from running the
 
01:48:49.669 --> 01:48:49.679 align:start position:0%
next time
 
01:48:52.850 --> 01:48:52.860 align:start position:0%
um I put that in there specifically to
 
01:48:55.070 --> 01:48:55.080 align:start position:0%
do the things that the legislator asked
 
01:48:58.250 --> 01:48:58.260 align:start position:0%
me to in past versions of these bills
 
01:49:01.129 --> 01:49:01.139 align:start position:0%
and that is provide a qualified
 
01:49:04.729 --> 01:49:04.739 align:start position:0%
candidate that will be knowledgeable of
 
01:49:07.149 --> 01:49:07.159 align:start position:0%
the things in that system
 
01:49:07.159 --> 01:49:09.010 align:start position:0%
the things in that system
and

01:49:09.010 --> 01:49:09.020 align:start position:0%
and
 
01:49:12.890 --> 01:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
again I did because the program is is
 
01:49:16.189 --> 01:49:16.199 align:start position:0%
just in its infancy I can't you know
 
01:49:18.890 --> 01:49:18.900 align:start position:0%
offer you a lot of details on what the
 
01:49:21.290 --> 01:49:21.300 align:start position:0%
court is going to put into there but
 
01:49:24.530 --> 01:49:24.540 align:start position:0%
again it's an effort to make sure that
 
01:49:26.570 --> 01:49:26.580 align:start position:0%
the person who is providing you
 
01:49:26.580 --> 01:49:28.129 align:start position:0%
the person who is providing you
information

01:49:28.129 --> 01:49:28.139 align:start position:0%
information
 
01:49:31.510 --> 01:49:31.520 align:start position:0%
about the state of your loved one
 
01:49:36.350 --> 01:49:36.360 align:start position:0%
has a at least a a basic amount of
 
01:49:40.010 --> 01:49:40.020 align:start position:0%
knowledge and that just as the account
 
01:49:42.729 --> 01:49:42.739 align:start position:0%
attorney is supposed to be an attorney
 
01:49:46.490 --> 01:49:46.500 align:start position:0%
okay we want to register probate to have
 
01:49:48.649 --> 01:49:48.659 align:start position:0%
you know some
 
01:49:51.109 --> 01:49:51.119 align:start position:0%
knowledge of the system and the
 
01:49:52.910 --> 01:49:52.920 align:start position:0%
procedures in the system be able to
 
01:49:56.270 --> 01:49:56.280 align:start position:0%
navigate the program a lot of
 
01:49:59.890 --> 01:49:59.900 align:start position:0%
uh people that are in my age bracket
 
01:50:02.930 --> 01:50:02.940 align:start position:0%
that aren't especially computer savvy
 
01:50:05.770 --> 01:50:05.780 align:start position:0%
that may be you know the biggest thing
 
01:50:08.510 --> 01:50:08.520 align:start position:0%
that this person would be able to do is
 
01:50:10.910 --> 01:50:10.920 align:start position:0%
teach them how to log on teach them how
 
01:50:14.090 --> 01:50:14.100 align:start position:0%
to uh you know navigate the system to
 
01:50:16.970 --> 01:50:16.980 align:start position:0%
into the information from the inventory
 
01:50:20.810 --> 01:50:20.820 align:start position:0%
or whatever into the system
 
01:50:23.450 --> 01:50:23.460 align:start position:0%
another question do you feel as if the
 
01:50:23.460 --> 01:50:24.649 align:start position:0%
another question do you feel as if the
voters

01:50:24.649 --> 01:50:24.659 align:start position:0%
voters
 
01:50:27.169 --> 01:50:27.179 align:start position:0%
could be able to adequately vet the
 
01:50:28.609 --> 01:50:28.619 align:start position:0%
register probate
 
01:50:30.290 --> 01:50:30.300 align:start position:0%
independently and we don't need
 
01:50:32.090 --> 01:50:32.100 align:start position:0%
necessarily need this bill because the
 
01:50:33.530 --> 01:50:33.540 align:start position:0%
voters are going to be the ones that
 
01:50:33.540 --> 01:50:34.490 align:start position:0%
voters are going to be the ones that
that

01:50:34.490 --> 01:50:34.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
01:50:38.510 --> 01:50:38.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:40.490 align:start position:0%
 
um

01:50:40.490 --> 01:50:40.500 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:50:43.790 --> 01:50:43.800 align:start position:0%
I have a great faith in many of the
 
01:50:47.750 --> 01:50:47.760 align:start position:0%
voters but I have spent 30 years as a
 
01:50:50.750 --> 01:50:50.760 align:start position:0%
moderator on and off because I tried to
 
01:50:53.390 --> 01:50:53.400 align:start position:0%
get rid of the job several times and it
 
01:50:56.390 --> 01:50:56.400 align:start position:0%
always seemed to come back do we have a
 
01:51:01.629 --> 01:51:01.639 align:start position:0%
large variety of uh of Voters who are
 
01:51:04.970 --> 01:51:04.980 align:start position:0%
some are very very well informed on
 
01:51:08.209 --> 01:51:08.219 align:start position:0%
issues and we have some that
 
01:51:08.219 --> 01:51:09.290 align:start position:0%
issues and we have some that
um

01:51:09.290 --> 01:51:09.300 align:start position:0%
um
 
01:51:11.629 --> 01:51:11.639 align:start position:0%
it's election day so it's time to go to
 
01:51:16.070 --> 01:51:16.080 align:start position:0%
the polls so you know that variation uh
 
01:51:20.270 --> 01:51:20.280 align:start position:0%
again I believe that the person that
 
01:51:24.050 --> 01:51:24.060 align:start position:0%
I send somebody to whether it's calling
 
01:51:26.890 --> 01:51:26.900 align:start position:0%
the court system telephone line
 
01:51:30.890 --> 01:51:30.900 align:start position:0%
or going to someone we're calling
 
01:51:33.950 --> 01:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
register probate that that individual
 
01:51:38.810 --> 01:51:38.820 align:start position:0%
should have a basic knowledge and that I
 
01:51:38.820 --> 01:51:39.729 align:start position:0%
should have a basic knowledge and that I
believe

01:51:39.729 --> 01:51:39.739 align:start position:0%
believe
 
01:51:43.129 --> 01:51:43.139 align:start position:0%
again even though this the navigator
 
01:51:46.609 --> 01:51:46.619 align:start position:0%
system was not depending on this it's
 
01:51:46.619 --> 01:51:47.689 align:start position:0%
system was not depending on this it's
not

01:51:47.689 --> 01:51:47.699 align:start position:0%
not
 
01:51:50.629 --> 01:51:50.639 align:start position:0%
you know it completely independent of
 
01:51:53.930 --> 01:51:53.940 align:start position:0%
this that I use that as a way to make
 
01:51:58.070 --> 01:51:58.080 align:start position:0%
sure that when you go to settle your
 
01:52:03.410 --> 01:52:03.420 align:start position:0%
great aunts estate that that person uh
 
01:52:06.470 --> 01:52:06.480 align:start position:0%
has received some training
 
01:52:12.649 --> 01:52:12.659 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:14.330 --> 01:52:14.340 align:start position:0%
or representative Chesterman if you want
 
01:52:18.530 --> 01:52:18.540 align:start position:0%
 
01:52:21.169 --> 01:52:21.179 align:start position:0%
I'd like to you know give you a thank
 
01:52:23.810 --> 01:52:23.820 align:start position:0%
you for doing this because this the
 
01:52:27.530 --> 01:52:27.540 align:start position:0%
probate position was sort of got got rid
 
01:52:31.669 --> 01:52:31.679 align:start position:0%
of when we reorganized the court system
 
01:52:34.550 --> 01:52:34.560 align:start position:0%
and it could put a lot of us in a
 
01:52:36.709 --> 01:52:36.719 align:start position:0%
position of having to go to
 
01:52:38.689 --> 01:52:38.699 align:start position:0%
a lawyer
 
01:52:40.310 --> 01:52:40.320 align:start position:0%
and pay him
 
01:52:42.590 --> 01:52:42.600 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's a great idea to do
 
01:52:42.600 --> 01:52:43.850 align:start position:0%
and I I think it's a great idea to do
this

01:52:43.850 --> 01:52:43.860 align:start position:0%
this
 
01:52:47.870 --> 01:52:47.880 align:start position:0%
because it it took a sort of a volunteer
 
01:52:47.880 --> 01:52:49.010 align:start position:0%
because it it took a sort of a volunteer
position

01:52:49.010 --> 01:52:49.020 align:start position:0%
position
 
01:52:52.129 --> 01:52:52.139 align:start position:0%
and and put it in the court system you
 
01:52:54.290 --> 01:52:54.300 align:start position:0%
know if you have a job do some some
 
01:52:56.570 --> 01:52:56.580 align:start position:0%
lawyers and we didn't need to get the
 
01:52:56.580 --> 01:52:57.470 align:start position:0%
lawyers and we didn't need to get the
job

01:52:57.470 --> 01:52:57.480 align:start position:0%
job
 
01:53:00.050 --> 01:53:00.060 align:start position:0%
I think this is a good idea
 
01:53:01.490 --> 01:53:01.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:53:03.410 --> 01:53:03.420 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton
 
01:53:04.970 --> 01:53:04.980 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair and thank you for
 
01:53:07.129 --> 01:53:07.139 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
01:53:10.910 --> 01:53:10.920 align:start position:0%
you know as volunteers legislators or a
 
01:53:13.129 --> 01:53:13.139 align:start position:0%
hundred dollars a year and we don't have
 
01:53:14.689 --> 01:53:14.699 align:start position:0%
an office of telephone and computer
 
01:53:17.209 --> 01:53:17.219 align:start position:0%
unless we provided ourselves as part of
 
01:53:19.010 --> 01:53:19.020 align:start position:0%
the volunteerism so
 
01:53:21.770 --> 01:53:21.780 align:start position:0%
I can relate to the the probate still
 
01:53:25.070 --> 01:53:25.080 align:start position:0%
being functional in the same sense that
 
01:53:27.350 --> 01:53:27.360 align:start position:0%
we are and can be
 
01:53:29.030 --> 01:53:29.040 align:start position:0%
um and and I don't believe that it's
 
01:53:32.810 --> 01:53:32.820 align:start position:0%
unreasonable for some retraining some
 
01:53:35.209 --> 01:53:35.219 align:start position:0%
training to be required because this
 
01:53:36.950 --> 01:53:36.960 align:start position:0%
could be an important position an
 
01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:39.840 align:start position:0%
important asset the question being
 
01:53:43.550 --> 01:53:43.560 align:start position:0%
the probate Navigator program is it
 
01:53:45.950 --> 01:53:45.960 align:start position:0%
already in existence and use and how
 
01:53:49.609 --> 01:53:49.619 align:start position:0%
 
01:53:51.890 --> 01:53:51.900 align:start position:0%
uh to the best of my knowledge it's just
 
01:53:54.350 --> 01:53:54.360 align:start position:0%
being developed and I don't believe that
 
01:53:56.270 --> 01:53:56.280 align:start position:0%
they are
 
01:53:57.890 --> 01:53:57.900 align:start position:0%
I don't believe that there's anybody
 
01:53:59.510 --> 01:53:59.520 align:start position:0%
that's actually gone through the program
 
01:53:59.520 --> 01:54:01.729 align:start position:0%
that's actually gone through the program
yet

01:54:01.729 --> 01:54:01.739 align:start position:0%
yet
 
01:54:02.930 --> 01:54:02.940 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
01:54:05.149 --> 01:54:05.159 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
01:54:07.990 --> 01:54:08.000 align:start position:0%
saying none thank you very much senator
 
01:54:34.450 --> 01:54:34.460 align:start position:0%
 
01:54:37.070 --> 01:54:37.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Mr chair and members of
 
01:54:38.870 --> 01:54:38.880 align:start position:0%
the committee my name is Kathy Stacy I
 
01:54:40.370 --> 01:54:40.380 align:start position:0%
am the legislative chair for the New
 
01:54:42.290 --> 01:54:42.300 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties
 
01:54:43.970 --> 01:54:43.980 align:start position:0%
and I'm the Rockingham County Register
 
01:54:46.910 --> 01:54:46.920 align:start position:0%
of Deeds so basically I've passed out
 
01:54:50.450 --> 01:54:50.460 align:start position:0%
some testimony that I sent several weeks
 
01:54:52.490 --> 01:54:52.500 align:start position:0%
ago to the committee members but I just
 
01:54:53.689 --> 01:54:53.699 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that you still had
 
01:54:53.699 --> 01:54:54.410 align:start position:0%
wanted to make sure that you still had
it

01:54:54.410 --> 01:54:54.420 align:start position:0%
it
 
01:54:56.030 --> 01:54:56.040 align:start position:0%
so you could take a look at it but the
 
01:54:57.470 --> 01:54:57.480 align:start position:0%
association of counties as opposed to
 
01:54:59.090 --> 01:54:59.100 align:start position:0%
this bill
 
01:55:01.669 --> 01:55:01.679 align:start position:0%
basically because it puts responsibility
 
01:55:03.950 --> 01:55:03.960 align:start position:0%
on the County Commissioners in this
 
01:55:06.290 --> 01:55:06.300 align:start position:0%
position register of probate
 
01:55:08.030 --> 01:55:08.040 align:start position:0%
has nothing to do with County government
 
01:55:10.129 --> 01:55:10.139 align:start position:0%
it is something that falls within the
 
01:55:12.950 --> 01:55:12.960 align:start position:0%
Judiciary the judicial branch and the
 
01:55:14.750 --> 01:55:14.760 align:start position:0%
oversight should be there not with the
 
01:55:17.030 --> 01:55:17.040 align:start position:0%
County Commissioners because we they do
 
01:55:18.050 --> 01:55:18.060 align:start position:0%
not function within the county
 
01:55:18.060 --> 01:55:19.790 align:start position:0%
not function within the county
whatsoever

01:55:19.790 --> 01:55:19.800 align:start position:0%
whatsoever
 
01:55:22.910 --> 01:55:22.920 align:start position:0%
so obviously the 30 Commissioners have
 
01:55:24.950 --> 01:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
met we had a meeting and they asked me
 
01:55:27.109 --> 01:55:27.119 align:start position:0%
to come here and say that they do not
 
01:55:28.910 --> 01:55:28.920 align:start position:0%
want to be included in this bill because
 
01:55:30.770 --> 01:55:30.780 align:start position:0%
they do not have any Authority with
 
01:55:32.570 --> 01:55:32.580 align:start position:0%
regards to the registered probate and
 
01:55:35.990 --> 01:55:36.000 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:41.510 --> 01:55:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
01:55:44.570 --> 01:55:44.580 align:start position:0%
can can I just ask a question my
 
01:55:47.870 --> 01:55:47.880 align:start position:0%
understanding is that all of the duties
 
01:55:50.149 --> 01:55:50.159 align:start position:0%
of what used to be the registers of
 
01:55:52.669 --> 01:55:52.679 align:start position:0%
probate who were elected are now
 
01:55:55.609 --> 01:55:55.619 align:start position:0%
performed by the clerks of the Circuit
 
01:55:58.010 --> 01:55:58.020 align:start position:0%
Court in particular those assigned to
 
01:56:00.709 --> 01:56:00.719 align:start position:0%
the probate division for each County
 
01:56:03.430 --> 01:56:03.440 align:start position:0%
are you aware of any
 
01:56:06.470 --> 01:56:06.480 align:start position:0%
calls by members of the public saying
 
01:56:07.790 --> 01:56:07.800 align:start position:0%
that somehow
 
01:56:09.709 --> 01:56:09.719 align:start position:0%
the clerks
 
01:56:12.890 --> 01:56:12.900 align:start position:0%
you know are and let me let me back up
 
01:56:14.570 --> 01:56:14.580 align:start position:0%
as I understand it the clerks do exactly
 
01:56:16.430 --> 01:56:16.440 align:start position:0%
what the registers of probate used to do
 
01:56:19.850 --> 01:56:19.860 align:start position:0%
correct and so are are you aware of any
 
01:56:21.770 --> 01:56:21.780 align:start position:0%
for lack of a better term outcry from
 
01:56:23.990 --> 01:56:24.000 align:start position:0%
the public saying that we
 
01:56:25.790 --> 01:56:25.800 align:start position:0%
we don't like what the clerks are doing
 
01:56:28.370 --> 01:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
we should now go back to register to the
 
01:56:30.590 --> 01:56:30.600 align:start position:0%
to the elected registers no I haven't
 
01:56:32.030 --> 01:56:32.040 align:start position:0%
heard that but what I have heard is
 
01:56:33.350 --> 01:56:33.360 align:start position:0%
complaints about customer service
 
01:56:35.209 --> 01:56:35.219 align:start position:0%
because at one time there were help
 
01:56:36.709 --> 01:56:36.719 align:start position:0%
centers Rockingham County had a Help
 
01:56:38.870 --> 01:56:38.880 align:start position:0%
Center and they had staff who would mean
 
01:56:40.609 --> 01:56:40.619 align:start position:0%
that help center and it really helped
 
01:56:41.810 --> 01:56:41.820 align:start position:0%
the public because the public could show
 
01:56:43.430 --> 01:56:43.440 align:start position:0%
up make they could make an appointment
 
01:56:45.890 --> 01:56:45.900 align:start position:0%
go and have assistance from a member of
 
01:56:49.669 --> 01:56:49.679 align:start position:0%
the Probate Court staff you know but
 
01:56:51.649 --> 01:56:51.659 align:start position:0%
other than that no other than that no
 
01:56:53.689 --> 01:56:53.699 align:start position:0%
that's and you're absolutely right the
 
01:56:55.430 --> 01:56:55.440 align:start position:0%
the person the position is the clerk
 
01:56:59.030 --> 01:56:59.040 align:start position:0%
there took on as register probate all
 
01:57:01.010 --> 01:57:01.020 align:start position:0%
their responsibilities
 
01:57:03.410 --> 01:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
01:57:05.510 --> 01:57:05.520 align:start position:0%
yes representative Hornet
 
01:57:07.970 --> 01:57:07.980 align:start position:0%
um well I should remember
 
01:57:09.950 --> 01:57:09.960 align:start position:0%
this is something I should I should know
 
01:57:12.530 --> 01:57:12.540 align:start position:0%
because I've worked in this uh area but
 
01:57:15.589 --> 01:57:15.599 align:start position:0%
um what happens when currently when if
 
01:57:17.330 --> 01:57:17.340 align:start position:0%
there is a vacancy in the registered
 
01:57:19.850 --> 01:57:19.860 align:start position:0%
probate office like this is just for me
 
01:57:23.930 --> 01:57:23.940 align:start position:0%
vacant or who appoints say a successor
 
01:57:26.030 --> 01:57:26.040 align:start position:0%
you know I I really I couldn't answer
 
01:57:28.609 --> 01:57:28.619 align:start position:0%
that I don't know who appoints um for
 
01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:31.320 align:start position:0%
them to tell you the honest truth
 
01:57:34.370 --> 01:57:34.380 align:start position:0%
 
01:57:35.870 --> 01:57:35.880 align:start position:0%
yeah something I do know the answer to
 
01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:37.860 align:start position:0%
because I helped sponsor the bill is I
 
01:57:39.169 --> 01:57:39.179 align:start position:0%
guess the registered probate they do
 
01:57:41.330 --> 01:57:41.340 align:start position:0%
various things in the lawn we actually
 
01:57:41.340 --> 01:57:42.709 align:start position:0%
various things in the lawn we actually
even

01:57:42.709 --> 01:57:42.719 align:start position:0%
even
 
01:57:45.290 --> 01:57:45.300 align:start position:0%
added we said well at least we clarified
 
01:57:47.510 --> 01:57:47.520 align:start position:0%
something that was in the registration
 
01:57:49.550 --> 01:57:49.560 align:start position:0%
of us in 2011 is that we empowered them
 
01:57:51.649 --> 01:57:51.659 align:start position:0%
to uh uh
 
01:57:54.290 --> 01:57:54.300 align:start position:0%
work with the state archives which is
 
01:57:56.209 --> 01:57:56.219 align:start position:0%
part of the Department of State to work
 
01:57:58.430 --> 01:57:58.440 align:start position:0%
on their Duty which was left which was
 
01:58:00.290 --> 01:58:00.300 align:start position:0%
preserving the historical records we did
 
01:58:01.550 --> 01:58:01.560 align:start position:0%
even uh
 
01:58:02.990 --> 01:58:03.000 align:start position:0%
allow them to work with the state
 
01:58:05.570 --> 01:58:05.580 align:start position:0%
archivists and use the funding that the
 
01:58:07.850 --> 01:58:07.860 align:start position:0%
state archivist has and they've that's a
 
01:58:10.189 --> 01:58:10.199 align:start position:0%
fairly uh they're basically a
 
01:58:12.169 --> 01:58:12.179 align:start position:0%
self-funding operation because because
 
01:58:15.350 --> 01:58:15.360 align:start position:0%
of uh money from filing Vital Records
 
01:58:17.330 --> 01:58:17.340 align:start position:0%
requests and the like so that's
 
01:58:19.070 --> 01:58:19.080 align:start position:0%
so I remember at least that part of it
 
01:58:22.550 --> 01:58:22.560 align:start position:0%
 
01:58:23.870 --> 01:58:23.880 align:start position:0%
critical records
 
01:58:24.890 --> 01:58:24.900 align:start position:0%
the function that the register of
 
01:58:24.900 --> 01:58:27.410 align:start position:0%
the function that the register of
program

01:58:27.410 --> 01:58:27.420 align:start position:0%

03:03:06.710 --> 03:03:06.720 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman members of the
 
03:03:08.210 --> 03:03:08.220 align:start position:0%
committee my name is Richard head I'm
 
03:03:09.830 --> 03:03:09.840 align:start position:0%
the government Affairs coordinator for
 
03:03:11.389 --> 03:03:11.399 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch this is a bill that
 
03:03:12.889 --> 03:03:12.899 align:start position:0%
we support in light of the fact that we
 
03:03:14.990 --> 03:03:15.000 align:start position:0%
ask that it be introduced
 
03:03:17.090 --> 03:03:17.100 align:start position:0%
um that's helpful I think
 
03:03:21.290 --> 03:03:21.300 align:start position:0%
um this is something of a technical bill
 
03:03:23.929 --> 03:03:23.939 align:start position:0%
um and it relates to involuntary
 
03:03:26.809 --> 03:03:26.819 align:start position:0%
emergency admissions but not probably in
 
03:03:28.070 --> 03:03:28.080 align:start position:0%
the way that you've heard in the news
 
03:03:32.030 --> 03:03:32.040 align:start position:0%
recently in terms of the lawsuits and
 
03:03:33.349 --> 03:03:33.359 align:start position:0%
um you know what's happening with
 
03:03:35.330 --> 03:03:35.340 align:start position:0%
patients relative to being in the
 
03:03:37.670 --> 03:03:37.680 align:start position:0%
hospitals being in a facility or things
 
03:03:41.030 --> 03:03:41.040 align:start position:0%
like that this relates to payment of
 
03:03:43.370 --> 03:03:43.380 align:start position:0%
attorneys who are performing work on
 
03:03:47.150 --> 03:03:47.160 align:start position:0%
behalf of individuals against whom a
 
03:03:49.250 --> 03:03:49.260 align:start position:0%
petition has been filed seeking an
 
03:03:52.790 --> 03:03:52.800 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency admission into a
 
03:03:54.950 --> 03:03:54.960 align:start position:0%
mental health facility
 
03:03:56.870 --> 03:03:56.880 align:start position:0%
um so by way of a little bit of
 
03:03:56.880 --> 03:03:58.190 align:start position:0%
um so by way of a little bit of
background

03:03:58.190 --> 03:03:58.200 align:start position:0%
background
 
03:04:01.370 --> 03:04:01.380 align:start position:0%
um historically the appointment and
 
03:04:04.490 --> 03:04:04.500 align:start position:0%
payment of of legal counsel in these
 
03:04:06.950 --> 03:04:06.960 align:start position:0%
cases has been handled by the Department
 
03:04:10.370 --> 03:04:10.380 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services
 
03:04:12.950 --> 03:04:12.960 align:start position:0%
um last year judge king the
 
03:04:14.450 --> 03:04:14.460 align:start position:0%
administrative judge of the circuit
 
03:04:17.990 --> 03:04:18.000 align:start position:0%
courts DHHS and
 
03:04:19.550 --> 03:04:19.560 align:start position:0%
um you know various other interested
 
03:04:22.670 --> 03:04:22.680 align:start position:0%
parties worked on the process that's
 
03:04:24.170 --> 03:04:24.180 align:start position:0%
involved with involuntary emergency
 
03:04:27.650 --> 03:04:27.660 align:start position:0%
Admissions and as part of that the
 
03:04:30.370 --> 03:04:30.380 align:start position:0%
process of
 
03:04:33.830 --> 03:04:33.840 align:start position:0%
appointing and paying for really
 
03:04:36.950 --> 03:04:36.960 align:start position:0%
appointing legal counsel came to the
 
03:04:38.330 --> 03:04:38.340 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
03:04:42.530 --> 03:04:42.540 align:start position:0%
so then we get into a an issue as to you
 
03:04:44.510 --> 03:04:44.520 align:start position:0%
know just mechanically paying the
 
03:04:47.870 --> 03:04:47.880 align:start position:0%
lawyers who are appointed to represent
 
03:04:50.510 --> 03:04:50.520 align:start position:0%
individuals in these involuntary
 
03:04:54.530 --> 03:04:54.540 align:start position:0%
emergency admissions the ieas and
 
03:04:54.540 --> 03:04:56.150 align:start position:0%
emergency admissions the ieas and
um

03:04:56.150 --> 03:04:56.160 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:04:58.610 --> 03:04:58.620 align:start position:0%
under current law if there is an
 
03:05:02.389 --> 03:05:02.399 align:start position:0%
ambiguity or no reference to how lawyers
 
03:05:04.370 --> 03:05:04.380 align:start position:0%
who are appointed by the court get paid
 
03:05:06.769 --> 03:05:06.779 align:start position:0%
it's paid by default by the judicial
 
03:05:06.779 --> 03:05:07.690 align:start position:0%
it's paid by default by the judicial
branch

03:05:07.690 --> 03:05:07.700 align:start position:0%
branch
 
03:05:07.700 --> 03:05:09.290 align:start position:0%
branch
and

03:05:09.290 --> 03:05:09.300 align:start position:0%
and
 
03:05:09.300 --> 03:05:10.010 align:start position:0%
and
um

03:05:10.010 --> 03:05:10.020 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:05:12.710 --> 03:05:12.720 align:start position:0%
it's not something that we do in terms
 
03:05:15.530 --> 03:05:15.540 align:start position:0%
of payment of indigent legal counsel
 
03:05:18.290 --> 03:05:18.300 align:start position:0%
that job Duty
 
03:05:21.889 --> 03:05:21.899 align:start position:0%
um is in in essentially I think every
 
03:05:24.230 --> 03:05:24.240 align:start position:0%
case uh handled by What's called the
 
03:05:26.210 --> 03:05:26.220 align:start position:0%
judicial Council which is not part of
 
03:05:27.830 --> 03:05:27.840 align:start position:0%
the judicial branch it's an executive
 
03:05:30.110 --> 03:05:30.120 align:start position:0%
branch agency and the director of that
 
03:05:33.650 --> 03:05:33.660 align:start position:0%
is is also here to testify
 
03:05:36.230 --> 03:05:36.240 align:start position:0%
over the last few years you may have
 
03:05:38.630 --> 03:05:38.640 align:start position:0%
seen other bills which we've presented
 
03:05:44.570 --> 03:05:44.580 align:start position:0%
to clarify with Indigent legal fees who
 
03:05:46.670 --> 03:05:46.680 align:start position:0%
actually is is paying the attorney sort
 
03:05:48.889 --> 03:05:48.899 align:start position:0%
of the mechanics of receiving the bills
 
03:05:50.750 --> 03:05:50.760 align:start position:0%
paying those and making sure they're
 
03:05:52.969 --> 03:05:52.979 align:start position:0%
paid and we've been clarifying A couple
 
03:05:55.070 --> 03:05:55.080 align:start position:0%
or cleaning up a couple statutes to make
 
03:05:58.309 --> 03:05:58.319 align:start position:0%
it clear that the actual payment to the
 
03:05:59.990 --> 03:06:00.000 align:start position:0%
lawyers goes through the judicial
 
03:06:01.969 --> 03:06:01.979 align:start position:0%
Council they have the process they have
 
03:06:03.710 --> 03:06:03.720 align:start position:0%
the ex the sort of knowledge of how that
 
03:06:05.690 --> 03:06:05.700 align:start position:0%
that process works
 
03:06:08.690 --> 03:06:08.700 align:start position:0%
um and and they can testify as to the
 
03:06:10.429 --> 03:06:10.439 align:start position:0%
the fiscal impact on them and whether
 
03:06:13.309 --> 03:06:13.319 align:start position:0%
they need resources but really what this
 
03:06:16.190 --> 03:06:16.200 align:start position:0%
does is simply addresses sort of the
 
03:06:18.110 --> 03:06:18.120 align:start position:0%
processing of the payments to legal
 
03:06:20.110 --> 03:06:20.120 align:start position:0%
counsel that are appointed by the courts
 
03:06:23.450 --> 03:06:23.460 align:start position:0%
in involuntary emergency admissions
 
03:06:25.610 --> 03:06:25.620 align:start position:0%
to follow the process that's followed in
 
03:06:28.010 --> 03:06:28.020 align:start position:0%
all other Indigent legal fee processes
 
03:06:31.010 --> 03:06:31.020 align:start position:0%
in in terms of payment
 
03:06:31.020 --> 03:06:32.870 align:start position:0%
in in terms of payment
um

03:06:32.870 --> 03:06:32.880 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:06:35.630 --> 03:06:35.640 align:start position:0%
in in just one thing I wanted to note in
 
03:06:38.630 --> 03:06:38.640 align:start position:0%
in the fiscal note that is on attached
 
03:06:40.370 --> 03:06:40.380 align:start position:0%
to the bill from the judicial Council
 
03:06:43.910 --> 03:06:43.920 align:start position:0%
again a separate executive branch agency
 
03:06:46.010 --> 03:06:46.020 align:start position:0%
there's two
 
03:06:49.190 --> 03:06:49.200 align:start position:0%
um costs that are that are listed we
 
03:06:51.469 --> 03:06:51.479 align:start position:0%
currently have contracts with the
 
03:06:53.510 --> 03:06:53.520 align:start position:0%
attorneys to provide these legal
 
03:06:56.210 --> 03:06:56.220 align:start position:0%
services and there are two ways in which
 
03:06:59.990 --> 03:07:00.000 align:start position:0%
the lawyers get appointed one is for the
 
03:07:03.170 --> 03:07:03.180 align:start position:0%
initial involuntary emergency admission
 
03:07:05.570 --> 03:07:05.580 align:start position:0%
so they're not in a hospital they're not
 
03:07:09.230 --> 03:07:09.240 align:start position:0%
in a mental hospital setting they're
 
03:07:11.469 --> 03:07:11.479 align:start position:0%
they're out and this is the initial
 
03:07:14.510 --> 03:07:14.520 align:start position:0%
involuntary emergency admission by
 
03:07:16.429 --> 03:07:16.439 align:start position:0%
contract with the judicial branch now
 
03:07:18.530 --> 03:07:18.540 align:start position:0%
previously with Health and Human
 
03:07:22.910 --> 03:07:22.920 align:start position:0%
Services there's a set fee per case and
 
03:07:24.590 --> 03:07:24.600 align:start position:0%
right now it's a hundred dollars per
 
03:07:26.570 --> 03:07:26.580 align:start position:0%
case that the attorneys get paid for
 
03:07:30.110 --> 03:07:30.120 align:start position:0%
those ieas that initial iea after I
 
03:07:31.670 --> 03:07:31.680 align:start position:0%
think it's 10 days but don't hold me to
 
03:07:35.030 --> 03:07:35.040 align:start position:0%
that if the individual needs to be needs
 
03:07:39.170 --> 03:07:39.180 align:start position:0%
to continue to be held in a medical
 
03:07:41.750 --> 03:07:41.760 align:start position:0%
facility there's a re-application
 
03:07:44.090 --> 03:07:44.100 align:start position:0%
process and that attorney represents
 
03:07:45.950 --> 03:07:45.960 align:start position:0%
again that individual the reapplication
 
03:07:49.730 --> 03:07:49.740 align:start position:0%
process and the contract uh fee for that
 
03:07:54.530 --> 03:07:54.540 align:start position:0%
is 65 an hour so in the fiscal note you
 
03:07:57.050 --> 03:07:57.060 align:start position:0%
see a minimum cost and a maximum cost by
 
03:07:58.730 --> 03:07:58.740 align:start position:0%
contract you're really only talking
 
03:08:01.370 --> 03:08:01.380 align:start position:0%
about that minimum cost and we're also
 
03:08:03.410 --> 03:08:03.420 align:start position:0%
not talking about new dollars these
 
03:08:04.969 --> 03:08:04.979 align:start position:0%
lawyers are getting paid today it's
 
03:08:07.550 --> 03:08:07.560 align:start position:0%
really just a question of who's managing
 
03:08:10.190 --> 03:08:10.200 align:start position:0%
those payments and it's not something
 
03:08:12.410 --> 03:08:12.420 align:start position:0%
that we do well it's something that the
 
03:08:14.750 --> 03:08:14.760 align:start position:0%
judicial Council does well so really all
 
03:08:17.030 --> 03:08:17.040 align:start position:0%
we're doing is Shifting responsibility
 
03:08:19.670 --> 03:08:19.680 align:start position:0%
but we're not changing sort of the
 
03:08:21.769 --> 03:08:21.779 align:start position:0%
overall dollar amount that's involved
 
03:08:24.590 --> 03:08:24.600 align:start position:0%
absent and you'll hear from the judicial
 
03:08:26.809 --> 03:08:26.819 align:start position:0%
Council they need additional internal
 
03:08:29.990 --> 03:08:30.000 align:start position:0%
resources for processing but in terms of
 
03:08:33.410 --> 03:08:33.420 align:start position:0%
the cost to council it's simply an issue
 
03:08:35.630 --> 03:08:35.640 align:start position:0%
of who's writing the check in in simple
 
03:08:35.640 --> 03:08:37.429 align:start position:0%
of who's writing the check in in simple
terms

03:08:37.429 --> 03:08:37.439 align:start position:0%
terms
 
03:08:39.349 --> 03:08:39.359 align:start position:0%
um with that I'll conclude my comments
 
03:08:40.790 --> 03:08:40.800 align:start position:0%
but I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
03:08:45.830 --> 03:08:45.840 align:start position:0%
I guess I I I do have a question uh
 
03:08:47.630 --> 03:08:47.640 align:start position:0%
that I wanted to take at the outset
 
03:08:49.250 --> 03:08:49.260 align:start position:0%
because I think it may generate other
 
03:08:49.260 --> 03:08:50.150 align:start position:0%
because I think it may generate other
questions

03:08:50.150 --> 03:08:50.160 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:08:52.370 --> 03:08:52.380 align:start position:0%
I have no problem at all with what
 
03:08:53.929 --> 03:08:53.939 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting in terms of changing
 
03:08:55.490 --> 03:08:55.500 align:start position:0%
the payment to the judicial it makes
 
03:08:58.010 --> 03:08:58.020 align:start position:0%
perfect sense to me but the thing that I
 
03:08:59.990 --> 03:09:00.000 align:start position:0%
guess I do have
 
03:09:03.170 --> 03:09:03.180 align:start position:0%
a question about is the wording
 
03:09:05.870 --> 03:09:05.880 align:start position:0%
of the bill as it comes to us from the
 
03:09:07.610 --> 03:09:07.620 align:start position:0%
Senate because
 
03:09:10.490 --> 03:09:10.500 align:start position:0%
as I read it and I'm quoting here it
 
03:09:12.830 --> 03:09:12.840 align:start position:0%
says if the client or person sought to
 
03:09:17.090 --> 03:09:17.100 align:start position:0%
be admitted does not have legal counsel
 
03:09:20.450 --> 03:09:20.460 align:start position:0%
so what as I read that that means that
 
03:09:24.050 --> 03:09:24.060 align:start position:0%
if Bill Gates is being involuntarily
 
03:09:26.870 --> 03:09:26.880 align:start position:0%
admitted he gets counsel paid for by the
 
03:09:26.880 --> 03:09:28.429 align:start position:0%
admitted he gets counsel paid for by the
state

03:09:28.429 --> 03:09:28.439 align:start position:0%
state
 
03:09:29.929 --> 03:09:29.939 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question I think
 
03:09:31.790 --> 03:09:31.800 align:start position:0%
that's why that language was inserted
 
03:09:33.830 --> 03:09:33.840 align:start position:0%
could bills Bill Gates is going to have
 
03:09:35.410 --> 03:09:35.420 align:start position:0%
his own attorney
 
03:09:38.090 --> 03:09:38.100 align:start position:0%
it's only those that do not have an
 
03:09:38.100 --> 03:09:39.250 align:start position:0%
it's only those that do not have an
attorney

03:09:39.250 --> 03:09:39.260 align:start position:0%
attorney
 
03:09:41.809 --> 03:09:41.819 align:start position:0%
for which the court will appoint an
 
03:09:46.730 --> 03:09:46.740 align:start position:0%
attorney so why why I mean maybe that's
 
03:09:48.950 --> 03:09:48.960 align:start position:0%
maybe that's right but what if Bill
 
03:09:50.750 --> 03:09:50.760 align:start position:0%
Gates shows up and doesn't have an
 
03:09:53.750 --> 03:09:53.760 align:start position:0%
attorney do we I mean I guess I guess
 
03:09:55.969 --> 03:09:55.979 align:start position:0%
what I'm concerned about is why
 
03:10:00.230 --> 03:10:00.240 align:start position:0%
it it could be read to remove to it
 
03:10:02.389 --> 03:10:02.399 align:start position:0%
could be read to say that
 
03:10:05.150 --> 03:10:05.160 align:start position:0%
even and in even somebody that's not
 
03:10:08.510 --> 03:10:08.520 align:start position:0%
indigent gets a lawyer at the expense of
 
03:10:12.469 --> 03:10:12.479 align:start position:0%
the state and that's what and so thank
 
03:10:15.050 --> 03:10:15.060 align:start position:0%
you for the question right now so
 
03:10:17.150 --> 03:10:17.160 align:start position:0%
it's an interesting process so the the
 
03:10:19.670 --> 03:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
goal is is sort of apply this to
 
03:10:21.830 --> 03:10:21.840 align:start position:0%
Indigent parties what
 
03:10:23.570 --> 03:10:23.580 align:start position:0%
in terms of practical experience every
 
03:10:25.370 --> 03:10:25.380 align:start position:0%
one of them is individual I'm sure
 
03:10:28.070 --> 03:10:28.080 align:start position:0%
that's awesome and doesn't sort of have
 
03:10:29.389 --> 03:10:29.399 align:start position:0%
the mental
 
03:10:32.090 --> 03:10:32.100 align:start position:0%
capacity at that stage to to sort of
 
03:10:34.730 --> 03:10:34.740 align:start position:0%
manage the the legal side of it and it
 
03:10:37.070 --> 03:10:37.080 align:start position:0%
all has to be done in the window of
 
03:10:40.010 --> 03:10:40.020 align:start position:0%
three days because that's the statutory
 
03:10:42.050 --> 03:10:42.060 align:start position:0%
time frame by which the filing occurs
 
03:10:45.710 --> 03:10:45.720 align:start position:0%
and and the hearing occurs
 
03:10:48.410 --> 03:10:48.420 align:start position:0%
um in and so this language was sort of
 
03:10:50.389 --> 03:10:50.399 align:start position:0%
built in because somebody who is a
 
03:10:52.070 --> 03:10:52.080 align:start position:0%
person of means is going to have their
 
03:10:54.230 --> 03:10:54.240 align:start position:0%
own as a practical matter Bill Gates is
 
03:10:57.349 --> 03:10:57.359 align:start position:0%
going to have an attorney and it is the
 
03:11:00.650 --> 03:11:00.660 align:start position:0%
the sort of simplest way of of checking
 
03:11:02.389 --> 03:11:02.399 align:start position:0%
that off in what is an incredibly tight
 
03:11:04.550 --> 03:11:04.560 align:start position:0%
I guess what I'm wondering but I'm as
 
03:11:06.889 --> 03:11:06.899 align:start position:0%
I'm what I'm wondering though is I mean
 
03:11:09.050 --> 03:11:09.060 align:start position:0%
suppose that somebody
 
03:11:11.570 --> 03:11:11.580 align:start position:0%
suppose that Bill Gates being a very
 
03:11:14.210 --> 03:11:14.220 align:start position:0%
smart businessman decides well this this
 
03:11:16.010 --> 03:11:16.020 align:start position:0%
says I don't have to pay for my attorney
 
03:11:17.630 --> 03:11:17.640 align:start position:0%
because the state will do it so I'm not
 
03:11:20.090 --> 03:11:20.100 align:start position:0%
paying for my attorney and and there is
 
03:11:22.370 --> 03:11:22.380 align:start position:0%
a possibility remote possibility that
 
03:11:23.510 --> 03:11:23.520 align:start position:0%
somebody would get a hundred dollars
 
03:11:25.610 --> 03:11:25.620 align:start position:0%
worth of legal fees
 
03:11:27.590 --> 03:11:27.600 align:start position:0%
um who may otherwise be wealthy the
 
03:11:30.050 --> 03:11:30.060 align:start position:0%
concern is you know to be able to get
 
03:11:32.690 --> 03:11:32.700 align:start position:0%
that individual to file a financial
 
03:11:36.070 --> 03:11:36.080 align:start position:0%
affidavit in a who is being involuntary
 
03:11:39.590 --> 03:11:39.600 align:start position:0%
involuntarily admitted for uh an
 
03:11:41.269 --> 03:11:41.279 align:start position:0%
emergency admission into a mental health
 
03:11:41.279 --> 03:11:43.130 align:start position:0%
emergency admission into a mental health
facility

03:11:43.130 --> 03:11:43.140 align:start position:0%
facility
 
03:11:45.950 --> 03:11:45.960 align:start position:0%
um the the reality is
 
03:11:45.960 --> 03:11:47.690 align:start position:0%
um the the reality is
um

03:11:47.690 --> 03:11:47.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:11:49.910 --> 03:11:49.920 align:start position:0%
in that circumstance you're not going to
 
03:11:51.410 --> 03:11:51.420 align:start position:0%
be able to get a sworn affidavit from
 
03:11:54.530 --> 03:11:54.540 align:start position:0%
that individual on financial means
 
03:11:56.630 --> 03:11:56.640 align:start position:0%
the experiences every one of these
 
03:11:59.570 --> 03:11:59.580 align:start position:0%
individuals is coming in in an Indigent
 
03:11:59.580 --> 03:12:00.490 align:start position:0%
individuals is coming in in an Indigent
status

03:12:00.490 --> 03:12:00.500 align:start position:0%
status
 
03:12:04.429 --> 03:12:04.439 align:start position:0%
and uh if Bill Gates were to appear and
 
03:12:06.889 --> 03:12:06.899 align:start position:0%
he wanted to get a hundred dollars worth
 
03:12:09.290 --> 03:12:09.300 align:start position:0%
of legal fees out of the state he might
 
03:12:11.030 --> 03:12:11.040 align:start position:0%
be able to manipulate the system to do
 
03:12:12.650 --> 03:12:12.660 align:start position:0%
that but the Practical reality is he's
 
03:12:14.450 --> 03:12:14.460 align:start position:0%
coming in with a with legal counsel or
 
03:12:16.670 --> 03:12:16.680 align:start position:0%
his family is I'm going to come in with
 
03:12:19.490 --> 03:12:19.500 align:start position:0%
legal counsel we needed a a fairly
 
03:12:22.969 --> 03:12:22.979 align:start position:0%
simple uh straightforward mechanism for
 
03:12:26.269 --> 03:12:26.279 align:start position:0%
making a determination at the outset
 
03:12:28.490 --> 03:12:28.500 align:start position:0%
um when we're talking about a three-day
 
03:12:30.469 --> 03:12:30.479 align:start position:0%
window really less than a three-day
 
03:12:32.330 --> 03:12:32.340 align:start position:0%
window because from the date of the
 
03:12:34.309 --> 03:12:34.319 align:start position:0%
filing to the date of the decision of
 
03:12:36.230 --> 03:12:36.240 align:start position:0%
the decision or the hearing has to be a
 
03:12:38.090 --> 03:12:38.100 align:start position:0%
three-day window
 
03:12:42.469 --> 03:12:42.479 align:start position:0%
um by Statute and uh if there is a a
 
03:12:44.150 --> 03:12:44.160 align:start position:0%
different trigger that you can come up
 
03:12:46.490 --> 03:12:46.500 align:start position:0%
with to be perfectly happy to look at
 
03:12:48.290 --> 03:12:48.300 align:start position:0%
that this seemed like a simple
 
03:12:48.300 --> 03:12:50.090 align:start position:0%
that this seemed like a simple
straightforward

03:12:50.090 --> 03:12:50.100 align:start position:0%
straightforward
 
03:12:52.370 --> 03:12:52.380 align:start position:0%
um approach for what is a fairly low
 
03:12:53.750 --> 03:12:53.760 align:start position:0%
risk event
 
03:12:53.760 --> 03:12:54.590 align:start position:0%
risk event
oh

03:12:54.590 --> 03:12:54.600 align:start position:0%
oh
 
03:12:58.849 --> 03:12:58.859 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:03.670 --> 03:13:03.680 align:start position:0%
 
03:13:06.889 --> 03:13:06.899 align:start position:0%
you said uh
 
03:13:09.769 --> 03:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
if I heard you correctly
 
03:13:13.670 --> 03:13:13.680 align:start position:0%
um that there's no
 
03:13:16.849 --> 03:13:16.859 align:start position:0%
difference in terms of cost the only
 
03:13:19.309 --> 03:13:19.319 align:start position:0%
difference is
 
03:13:21.230 --> 03:13:21.240 align:start position:0%
whose pocket
 
03:13:24.050 --> 03:13:24.060 align:start position:0%
the money's coming from is that
 
03:13:26.570 --> 03:13:26.580 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question yes so
 
03:13:26.580 --> 03:13:28.429 align:start position:0%
so thank you for the question yes so
currently

03:13:28.429 --> 03:13:28.439 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:13:28.439 --> 03:13:29.210 align:start position:0%
currently
um

03:13:29.210 --> 03:13:29.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:13:32.269 --> 03:13:32.279 align:start position:0%
the council for the Indigent part for
 
03:13:35.809 --> 03:13:35.819 align:start position:0%
the for the Aya party is being paid and
 
03:13:37.250 --> 03:13:37.260 align:start position:0%
currently it's being they're being paid
 
03:13:39.950 --> 03:13:39.960 align:start position:0%
out of the judicial branch what we're
 
03:13:43.490 --> 03:13:43.500 align:start position:0%
talking is that come uh the new next
 
03:13:44.630 --> 03:13:44.640 align:start position:0%
fiscal year
 
03:13:47.750 --> 03:13:47.760 align:start position:0%
that check is going to be written by
 
03:13:49.670 --> 03:13:49.680 align:start position:0%
judicial Council instead of the judicial
 
03:13:49.680 --> 03:13:50.750 align:start position:0%
judicial Council instead of the judicial
branch

03:13:50.750 --> 03:13:50.760 align:start position:0%
branch
 
03:13:53.570 --> 03:13:53.580 align:start position:0%
could I follow up of course and so but
 
03:13:56.570 --> 03:13:56.580 align:start position:0%
just to clarify there may be a resource
 
03:13:58.429 --> 03:13:58.439 align:start position:0%
needed in the judicial or in the
 
03:14:01.070 --> 03:14:01.080 align:start position:0%
judicial Council in order to have
 
03:14:02.690 --> 03:14:02.700 align:start position:0%
sufficient number of people and their
 
03:14:05.210 --> 03:14:05.220 align:start position:0%
staff and that's a an expense that's
 
03:14:06.650 --> 03:14:06.660 align:start position:0%
different than what I'm talking about
 
03:14:09.110 --> 03:14:09.120 align:start position:0%
I'm simply the dollars that are going to
 
03:14:15.230 --> 03:14:15.240 align:start position:0%
 
03:14:18.410 --> 03:14:18.420 align:start position:0%
pack goes into effect 60 days after
 
03:14:18.420 --> 03:14:20.809 align:start position:0%
pack goes into effect 60 days after
Passage

03:14:20.809 --> 03:14:20.819 align:start position:0%
Passage
 
03:14:25.910 --> 03:14:25.920 align:start position:0%
um I gather that neither the judicial
 
03:14:30.490 --> 03:14:30.500 align:start position:0%
branch nor the judicial Council
 
03:14:35.269 --> 03:14:35.279 align:start position:0%
thought to include any necessary changes
 
03:14:37.150 --> 03:14:37.160 align:start position:0%
in appropriation
 
03:14:40.790 --> 03:14:40.800 align:start position:0%
in the budget that is currently has now
 
03:14:43.490 --> 03:14:43.500 align:start position:0%
left the house and is in the Senate is
 
03:14:46.010 --> 03:14:46.020 align:start position:0%
that is that true um so thank you for
 
03:14:48.230 --> 03:14:48.240 align:start position:0%
the question uh I don't know about the
 
03:14:50.090 --> 03:14:50.100 align:start position:0%
judicial Council that's probably true
 
03:14:52.610 --> 03:14:52.620 align:start position:0%
for the judicial branch one other note
 
03:14:54.769 --> 03:14:54.779 align:start position:0%
which I didn't say is is that currently
 
03:14:57.769 --> 03:14:57.779 align:start position:0%
we did get some arpa money for our
 
03:15:00.290 --> 03:15:00.300 align:start position:0%
current payments and that would transfer
 
03:15:02.150 --> 03:15:02.160 align:start position:0%
over if there's I think there'll be some
 
03:15:04.309 --> 03:15:04.319 align:start position:0%
residual on that so we would have to
 
03:15:07.370 --> 03:15:07.380 align:start position:0%
work with the
 
03:15:07.380 --> 03:15:08.030 align:start position:0%
work with the
um

03:15:08.030 --> 03:15:08.040 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:15:11.269 --> 03:15:11.279 align:start position:0%
whatever the acronym is for uh for the
 
03:15:13.370 --> 03:15:13.380 align:start position:0%
ARP of handling to be able to transfer
 
03:15:16.610 --> 03:15:16.620 align:start position:0%
that same money over to judicial Council
 
03:15:18.410 --> 03:15:18.420 align:start position:0%
but generally this would be General
 
03:15:20.929 --> 03:15:20.939 align:start position:0%
funded monies absent the current sort of
 
03:15:23.510 --> 03:15:23.520 align:start position:0%
arpa Grant could I would could I ask one
 
03:15:26.090 --> 03:15:26.100 align:start position:0%
more question laboring it
 
03:15:30.050 --> 03:15:30.060 align:start position:0%
so what that would mean if I'm correct
 
03:15:33.650 --> 03:15:33.660 align:start position:0%
and I hope I'm not correct
 
03:15:35.750 --> 03:15:35.760 align:start position:0%
is that
 
03:15:38.450 --> 03:15:38.460 align:start position:0%
60 days after Passage
 
03:15:41.990 --> 03:15:42.000 align:start position:0%
an expense that the judicial branch has
 
03:15:43.969 --> 03:15:43.979 align:start position:0%
been absorbing
 
03:15:46.670 --> 03:15:46.680 align:start position:0%
will disappear from the judicial
 
03:15:50.090 --> 03:15:50.100 align:start position:0%
Branch's responsibility and
 
03:15:52.309 --> 03:15:52.319 align:start position:0%
the council
 
03:15:55.330 --> 03:15:55.340 align:start position:0%
would have additional
 
03:15:59.269 --> 03:15:59.279 align:start position:0%
responsibility with other than the
 
03:16:02.090 --> 03:16:02.100 align:start position:0%
potential of arpa money no provision
 
03:16:05.330 --> 03:16:05.340 align:start position:0%
having been made for the increase in
 
03:16:05.340 --> 03:16:06.530 align:start position:0%
having been made for the increase in
their

03:16:06.530 --> 03:16:06.540 align:start position:0%
their
 
03:16:06.540 --> 03:16:07.250 align:start position:0%
their
um

03:16:07.250 --> 03:16:07.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:16:09.230 --> 03:16:09.240 align:start position:0%
in their obligations
 
03:16:11.210 --> 03:16:11.220 align:start position:0%
so I can't talk to their appropriation
 
03:16:13.309 --> 03:16:13.319 align:start position:0%
request I've not looked at it but there
 
03:16:15.410 --> 03:16:15.420 align:start position:0%
would be the the initial part of it
 
03:16:17.570 --> 03:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
presumably would be funded through the
 
03:16:20.090 --> 03:16:20.100 align:start position:0%
arpa grant money that that currently has
 
03:16:23.210 --> 03:16:23.220 align:start position:0%
been allocated towards this purpose
 
03:16:25.550 --> 03:16:25.560 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr Hicks yes
 
03:16:29.210 --> 03:16:29.220 align:start position:0%
representative Perez thank you
 
03:16:31.730 --> 03:16:31.740 align:start position:0%
okay I'm not Bill Gates but I have two
 
03:16:34.550 --> 03:16:34.560 align:start position:0%
questions my first question is
 
03:16:37.070 --> 03:16:37.080 align:start position:0%
the money's coming from appropriated
 
03:16:39.290 --> 03:16:39.300 align:start position:0%
from Indigent defense
 
03:16:41.870 --> 03:16:41.880 align:start position:0%
that's a bucket of money
 
03:16:46.969 --> 03:16:46.979 align:start position:0%
correct it's uh general fund money okay
 
03:16:49.849 --> 03:16:49.859 align:start position:0%
so except for as I said in response to
 
03:16:52.429 --> 03:16:52.439 align:start position:0%
Representatives payments now is there
 
03:16:54.650 --> 03:16:54.660 align:start position:0%
anything that says I know you say if
 
03:16:56.929 --> 03:16:56.939 align:start position:0%
they have their own lawyer but quite
 
03:16:56.939 --> 03:16:58.190 align:start position:0%
they have their own lawyer but quite
honestly

03:16:58.190 --> 03:16:58.200 align:start position:0%
honestly
 
03:17:01.670 --> 03:17:01.680 align:start position:0%
um if my husband involuntarily
 
03:17:01.680 --> 03:17:02.330 align:start position:0%
um if my husband involuntarily
um

03:17:02.330 --> 03:17:02.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:17:06.110 --> 03:17:06.120 align:start position:0%
had me admitted he certainly has the
 
03:17:08.389 --> 03:17:08.399 align:start position:0%
means to be able to pay for a lawyer for
 
03:17:08.399 --> 03:17:09.110 align:start position:0%
means to be able to pay for a lawyer for
me

03:17:09.110 --> 03:17:09.120 align:start position:0%
me
 
03:17:11.269 --> 03:17:11.279 align:start position:0%
why would he
 
03:17:14.150 --> 03:17:14.160 align:start position:0%
why would he pay
 
03:17:16.969 --> 03:17:16.979 align:start position:0%
if he doesn't have to pay number one
 
03:17:19.250 --> 03:17:19.260 align:start position:0%
and I hate to see
 
03:17:22.370 --> 03:17:22.380 align:start position:0%
I hate to see that become a habit that's
 
03:17:23.809 --> 03:17:23.819 align:start position:0%
my first question
 
03:17:25.910 --> 03:17:25.920 align:start position:0%
it's kind of a question
 
03:17:29.030 --> 03:17:29.040 align:start position:0%
but the other one is what about
 
03:17:31.730 --> 03:17:31.740 align:start position:0%
um parents right now we're having a huge
 
03:17:36.610 --> 03:17:36.620 align:start position:0%
influx of children who are being
 
03:17:40.070 --> 03:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
involuntarily put in for perhaps three
 
03:17:44.030 --> 03:17:44.040 align:start position:0%
days observation for perhaps attempted
 
03:17:46.510 --> 03:17:46.520 align:start position:0%
suicide or drugs
 
03:17:50.269 --> 03:17:50.279 align:start position:0%
they is this cover them too because if
 
03:17:52.070 --> 03:17:52.080 align:start position:0%
their parents could pay does it cover
 
03:17:54.110 --> 03:17:54.120 align:start position:0%
them because their parents can it's
 
03:17:56.090 --> 03:17:56.100 align:start position:0%
their parents financial statement not
 
03:17:59.330 --> 03:17:59.340 align:start position:0%
the the child's financial statements
 
03:18:00.530 --> 03:18:00.540 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I
 
03:18:00.540 --> 03:18:02.090 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question I
currently

03:18:02.090 --> 03:18:02.100 align:start position:0%
currently
 
03:18:04.370 --> 03:18:04.380 align:start position:0%
um everybody who is
 
03:18:07.070 --> 03:18:07.080 align:start position:0%
uh against whom an involuntary admission
 
03:18:11.690 --> 03:18:11.700 align:start position:0%
is being sought is oh is is providing an
 
03:18:13.849 --> 03:18:13.859 align:start position:0%
attorney and those are paid for through
 
03:18:16.969 --> 03:18:16.979 align:start position:0%
 
03:18:19.190 --> 03:18:19.200 align:start position:0%
other other questions yes representative
 
03:18:21.230 --> 03:18:21.240 align:start position:0%
Alexander thank you this is a follow-up
 
03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:22.800 align:start position:0%
representative Perez and representative
 
03:18:22.800 --> 03:18:24.410 align:start position:0%
representative Perez and representative
Lynn

03:18:24.410 --> 03:18:24.420 align:start position:0%
Lynn
 
03:18:26.210 --> 03:18:26.220 align:start position:0%
is there any
 
03:18:27.769 --> 03:18:27.779 align:start position:0%
when when somebody is admitted
 
03:18:27.779 --> 03:18:30.349 align:start position:0%
when when somebody is admitted
involuntarily

03:18:30.349 --> 03:18:30.359 align:start position:0%
involuntarily
 
03:18:32.929 --> 03:18:32.939 align:start position:0%
they would almost always get the hunt
 
03:18:34.730 --> 03:18:34.740 align:start position:0%
the first hundred dollar fee paid
 
03:18:37.429 --> 03:18:37.439 align:start position:0%
because they're technically not able to
 
03:18:39.769 --> 03:18:39.779 align:start position:0%
fill out the individ Indigent form so
 
03:18:42.530 --> 03:18:42.540 align:start position:0%
are they assumed Indigent until they say
 
03:18:44.450 --> 03:18:44.460 align:start position:0%
they aren't so
 
03:18:46.670 --> 03:18:46.680 align:start position:0%
if I could follow up would that would
 
03:18:48.410 --> 03:18:48.420 align:start position:0%
that would you say that everybody is
 
03:18:50.929 --> 03:18:50.939 align:start position:0%
going to get the 100
 
03:18:52.610 --> 03:18:52.620 align:start position:0%
um for the first hearing because there's
 
03:18:53.809 --> 03:18:53.819 align:start position:0%
no way to determine if they're not
 
03:18:56.690 --> 03:18:56.700 align:start position:0%
Indigent until they're
 
03:18:59.030 --> 03:18:59.040 align:start position:0%
it's involuntary emissions so there must
 
03:19:01.010 --> 03:19:01.020 align:start position:0%
be like something mentally like they're
 
03:19:02.450 --> 03:19:02.460 align:start position:0%
struggling with so right can you explain
 
03:19:04.370 --> 03:19:04.380 align:start position:0%
that sure thank you for the questions as
 
03:19:06.050 --> 03:19:06.060 align:start position:0%
a practical matter that's exactly right
 
03:19:08.030 --> 03:19:08.040 align:start position:0%
it's just you know given the time frame
 
03:19:10.790 --> 03:19:10.800 align:start position:0%
the lack of of ability to extract
 
03:19:12.830 --> 03:19:12.840 align:start position:0%
information out of an individual in a in
 
03:19:16.370 --> 03:19:16.380 align:start position:0%
a way that's reliable and
 
03:19:16.380 --> 03:19:17.450 align:start position:0%
a way that's reliable and
um

03:19:17.450 --> 03:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:19:19.309 --> 03:19:19.319 align:start position:0%
in the sort of the nature of the
 
03:19:19.319 --> 03:19:20.870 align:start position:0%
in the sort of the nature of the
proceeding

03:19:20.870 --> 03:19:20.880 align:start position:0%
proceeding
 
03:19:20.880 --> 03:19:23.389 align:start position:0%
proceeding
um

03:19:23.389 --> 03:19:23.399 align:start position:0%
 
03:19:26.389 --> 03:19:26.399 align:start position:0%
everybody who has appeared in this in
 
03:19:29.210 --> 03:19:29.220 align:start position:0%
this type of a setting has been uh has
 
03:19:31.610 --> 03:19:31.620 align:start position:0%
been given legal counsel and that has
 
03:19:33.650 --> 03:19:33.660 align:start position:0%
been funded through this process and
 
03:19:35.269 --> 03:19:35.279 align:start position:0%
it's not the first hundred dollars it's
 
03:19:37.790 --> 03:19:37.800 align:start position:0%
the hundred dollars is the is the flat
 
03:19:41.090 --> 03:19:41.100 align:start position:0%
fee and then uh if they are if a
 
03:19:43.550 --> 03:19:43.560 align:start position:0%
readmission is sought to 65 flat fee for
 
03:19:45.590 --> 03:19:45.600 align:start position:0%
that legal counsel
 
03:19:49.490 --> 03:19:49.500 align:start position:0%
yeah sure is there is there language you
 
03:19:51.410 --> 03:19:51.420 align:start position:0%
would recommend to put in that would
 
03:19:53.809 --> 03:19:53.819 align:start position:0%
maybe close the loophole there so that
 
03:19:55.010 --> 03:19:55.020 align:start position:0%
only the people that are really
 
03:19:57.050 --> 03:19:57.060 align:start position:0%
determined to Jen are the ones that are
 
03:19:59.330 --> 03:19:59.340 align:start position:0%
getting this money because I'm concerned
 
03:20:01.969 --> 03:20:01.979 align:start position:0%
about everybody getting the flat fee and
 
03:20:03.530 --> 03:20:03.540 align:start position:0%
there's no way to retroactively make
 
03:20:05.750 --> 03:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
them pay the fee back so sure so thank
 
03:20:07.370 --> 03:20:07.380 align:start position:0%
you for the question I'm looking for for
 
03:20:09.889 --> 03:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
like recommendations yeah sure um one
 
03:20:11.870 --> 03:20:11.880 align:start position:0%
you know one mechanism would be so
 
03:20:14.389 --> 03:20:14.399 align:start position:0%
there's the office of Cost Containment
 
03:20:16.370 --> 03:20:16.380 align:start position:0%
um we could add language in that after
 
03:20:18.650 --> 03:20:18.660 align:start position:0%
the fact office of Cost Containment has
 
03:20:20.750 --> 03:20:20.760 align:start position:0%
the right to seek
 
03:20:24.170 --> 03:20:24.180 align:start position:0%
um any fees that that do not qualify as
 
03:20:24.180 --> 03:20:25.309 align:start position:0%
um any fees that that do not qualify as
indigent

03:20:25.309 --> 03:20:25.319 align:start position:0%
indigent
 
03:20:27.050 --> 03:20:27.060 align:start position:0%
if you could send me over recommended
 
03:20:28.670 --> 03:20:28.680 align:start position:0%
language I'd be happy to I'll send a
 
03:20:30.469 --> 03:20:30.479 align:start position:0%
language should I send it just you
 
03:20:32.030 --> 03:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
representative or to the committee I'm
 
03:20:33.110 --> 03:20:33.120 align:start position:0%
sure the committee would love to look at
 
03:20:34.550 --> 03:20:34.560 align:start position:0%
yeah no committee because I have to I
 
03:20:36.410 --> 03:20:36.420 align:start position:0%
have to be honest with you Mr head I I'm
 
03:20:39.889 --> 03:20:39.899 align:start position:0%
I I could not support this bill the way
 
03:20:41.870 --> 03:20:41.880 align:start position:0%
it's worded because of that very issue I
 
03:20:45.769 --> 03:20:45.779 align:start position:0%
mean it just seems like it's too easy
 
03:20:48.290 --> 03:20:48.300 align:start position:0%
I mean you know I I can imagine that
 
03:20:50.570 --> 03:20:50.580 align:start position:0%
most I'm I'm sure it's probably you know
 
03:20:55.010 --> 03:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
probably the vast majority of situations
 
03:20:58.190 --> 03:20:58.200 align:start position:0%
um a person probably is Indigent but I'm
 
03:21:00.469 --> 03:21:00.479 align:start position:0%
not sure that that's that that's all of
 
03:21:02.230 --> 03:21:02.240 align:start position:0%
the situations number one and number two
 
03:21:07.730 --> 03:21:07.740 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that in law we ought to be
 
03:21:10.010 --> 03:21:10.020 align:start position:0%
kind of drawing that making that
 
03:21:12.590 --> 03:21:12.600 align:start position:0%
presumption because it may be you know I
 
03:21:14.929 --> 03:21:14.939 align:start position:0%
would seem to be a judge probably has
 
03:21:18.889 --> 03:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
even if the person is on K is unable or
 
03:21:21.590 --> 03:21:21.600 align:start position:0%
unwilling to fill out an affidavit the
 
03:21:23.450 --> 03:21:23.460 align:start position:0%
judge may be able under the circum to
 
03:21:25.550 --> 03:21:25.560 align:start position:0%
make certain findings about you know
 
03:21:27.110 --> 03:21:27.120 align:start position:0%
based on the circumstances under which
 
03:21:29.389 --> 03:21:29.399 align:start position:0%
the person was brought in whether or not
 
03:21:32.450 --> 03:21:32.460 align:start position:0%
they likely are are Indigent or not
 
03:21:34.670 --> 03:21:34.680 align:start position:0%
um and and and so that you know there
 
03:21:36.650 --> 03:21:36.660 align:start position:0%
may be some cases in which the the judge
 
03:21:38.570 --> 03:21:38.580 align:start position:0%
might be able to make findings that from
 
03:21:40.490 --> 03:21:40.500 align:start position:0%
the circumstances that they probably are
 
03:21:41.929 --> 03:21:41.939 align:start position:0%
not interested again I think that's
 
03:21:45.170 --> 03:21:45.180 align:start position:0%
probably a a low percentage of places
 
03:21:45.180 --> 03:21:46.370 align:start position:0%
probably a a low percentage of places
but

03:21:46.370 --> 03:21:46.380 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:21:47.929 --> 03:21:47.939 align:start position:0%
um but I would definitely support
 
03:21:50.269 --> 03:21:50.279 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's
 
03:21:50.279 --> 03:21:51.590 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander's
um

03:21:51.590 --> 03:21:51.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:21:54.050 --> 03:21:54.060 align:start position:0%
suggestion that
 
03:21:55.969 --> 03:21:55.979 align:start position:0%
um and I would seem to me that it ought
 
03:21:58.790 --> 03:21:58.800 align:start position:0%
to say something that the standard ought
 
03:22:00.650 --> 03:22:00.660 align:start position:0%
to be that the person is Indigent maybe
 
03:22:02.510 --> 03:22:02.520 align:start position:0%
there should be some language that says
 
03:22:06.469 --> 03:22:06.479 align:start position:0%
if the if that can't be determined you
 
03:22:09.889 --> 03:22:09.899 align:start position:0%
know in the time frame necessary to make
 
03:22:13.490 --> 03:22:13.500 align:start position:0%
the the uh for the court to to make a
 
03:22:15.170 --> 03:22:15.180 align:start position:0%
decision then then the court will
 
03:22:16.969 --> 03:22:16.979 align:start position:0%
appoint an attorney with the
 
03:22:19.309 --> 03:22:19.319 align:start position:0%
understanding that the that the office
 
03:22:20.870 --> 03:22:20.880 align:start position:0%
it'll be referred to the office of Cost
 
03:22:22.969 --> 03:22:22.979 align:start position:0%
Containment to conduct an investigation
 
03:22:26.150 --> 03:22:26.160 align:start position:0%
about the person happy to circulate some
 
03:22:27.530 --> 03:22:27.540 align:start position:0%
language to the committee that that
 
03:22:28.910 --> 03:22:28.920 align:start position:0%
would address
 
03:22:31.429 --> 03:22:31.439 align:start position:0%
really I think in every case it'd be
 
03:22:32.870 --> 03:22:32.880 align:start position:0%
after the fact but
 
03:22:34.790 --> 03:22:34.800 align:start position:0%
um but like you said if there was
 
03:22:36.170 --> 03:22:36.180 align:start position:0%
information available to the judge at
 
03:22:37.550 --> 03:22:37.560 align:start position:0%
the time
 
03:22:37.560 --> 03:22:38.269 align:start position:0%
the time
um

03:22:38.269 --> 03:22:38.279 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:22:41.809 --> 03:22:41.819 align:start position:0%
right the one issue is I almost always
 
03:22:43.190 --> 03:22:43.200 align:start position:0%
has to happen after the fact it was
 
03:22:44.570 --> 03:22:44.580 align:start position:0%
really the judge doesn't have the
 
03:22:46.730 --> 03:22:46.740 align:start position:0%
opportunity to continue the case right
 
03:22:49.070 --> 03:22:49.080 align:start position:0%
pending getting an attorney
 
03:22:50.630 --> 03:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
um but I but I can certainly there are
 
03:22:52.070 --> 03:22:52.080 align:start position:0%
other statutes in which the offensive
 
03:22:53.630 --> 03:22:53.640 align:start position:0%
Cost Containment has an after the fact
 
03:22:55.670 --> 03:22:55.680 align:start position:0%
role in in terms of collection so I can
 
03:22:57.050 --> 03:22:57.060 align:start position:0%
add something along those lines okay
 
03:23:00.250 --> 03:23:00.260 align:start position:0%
well maybe some something toward like
 
03:23:02.870 --> 03:23:02.880 align:start position:0%
should the through the through the court
 
03:23:02.880 --> 03:23:04.190 align:start position:0%
should the through the through the court
process

03:23:04.190 --> 03:23:04.200 align:start position:0%
process
 
03:23:06.710 --> 03:23:06.720 align:start position:0%
um the um person that was admitted found
 
03:23:09.110 --> 03:23:09.120 align:start position:0%
not to be Indigent then the office Cost
 
03:23:11.750 --> 03:23:11.760 align:start position:0%
Containment May yeah I mean it just as a
 
03:23:13.790 --> 03:23:13.800 align:start position:0%
practical matter the the person is in
 
03:23:16.910 --> 03:23:16.920 align:start position:0%
court for the hearing and the hearing is
 
03:23:19.670 --> 03:23:19.680 align:start position:0%
done that it's over uh there's not a you
 
03:23:21.349 --> 03:23:21.359 align:start position:0%
know unlike a criminal case a civil case
 
03:23:22.490 --> 03:23:22.500 align:start position:0%
where there's
 
03:23:25.309 --> 03:23:25.319 align:start position:0%
repeated involvement it's a it's a it's
 
03:23:27.110 --> 03:23:27.120 align:start position:0%
essentially a one and done
 
03:23:28.729 --> 03:23:28.739 align:start position:0%
um so if we don't have information on
 
03:23:30.469 --> 03:23:30.479 align:start position:0%
day one we're not going to collect it
 
03:23:33.410 --> 03:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
but notwithstanding that I think there
 
03:23:35.809 --> 03:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
is probably some pretty basic language I
 
03:23:38.150 --> 03:23:38.160 align:start position:0%
can add that authorizes the state to
 
03:23:40.729 --> 03:23:40.739 align:start position:0%
ensure that the party who has received
 
03:23:44.030 --> 03:23:44.040 align:start position:0%
it is is eligible for state-funded
 
03:23:44.040 --> 03:23:50.630 align:start position:0%
it is is eligible for state-funded
Council

03:23:50.630 --> 03:23:50.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:23:53.210 --> 03:23:53.220 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair
 
03:23:55.130 --> 03:23:55.140 align:start position:0%
um Mr head I would be concerned about
 
03:23:58.550 --> 03:23:58.560 align:start position:0%
the the opposite situation too where a
 
03:24:02.450 --> 03:24:02.460 align:start position:0%
family let's assume a child is is going
 
03:24:04.309 --> 03:24:04.319 align:start position:0%
through this process where a family
 
03:24:07.969 --> 03:24:07.979 align:start position:0%
feels the need to retain counsel
 
03:24:10.729 --> 03:24:10.739 align:start position:0%
um without a family that may in fact be
 
03:24:13.969 --> 03:24:13.979 align:start position:0%
Indigent it feels a need to retain
 
03:24:17.269 --> 03:24:17.279 align:start position:0%
private counsel and I think the language
 
03:24:19.670 --> 03:24:19.680 align:start position:0%
that's being suggested would then
 
03:24:22.670 --> 03:24:22.680 align:start position:0%
trigger a process to inform people that
 
03:24:24.469 --> 03:24:24.479 align:start position:0%
if they're Indigent they have a right to
 
03:24:27.349 --> 03:24:27.359 align:start position:0%
court appointed counsel and that may
 
03:24:30.170 --> 03:24:30.180 align:start position:0%
then obviate the need or the feeling the
 
03:24:32.030 --> 03:24:32.040 align:start position:0%
pressure for them to retain Council
 
03:24:33.530 --> 03:24:33.540 align:start position:0%
private counsel
 
03:24:36.889 --> 03:24:36.899 align:start position:0%
um so thank you and certainly I think
 
03:24:38.929 --> 03:24:38.939 align:start position:0%
it's never happened
 
03:24:42.469 --> 03:24:42.479 align:start position:0%
um as a practical matter but certainly
 
03:24:44.269 --> 03:24:44.279 align:start position:0%
if if
 
03:24:44.279 --> 03:24:46.370 align:start position:0%
if if
um

03:24:46.370 --> 03:24:46.380 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:48.349 --> 03:24:48.359 align:start position:0%
in the process I think you can become
 
03:24:51.530 --> 03:24:51.540 align:start position:0%
known that if a party is Indigent then
 
03:24:57.530 --> 03:24:57.540 align:start position:0%
 
03:24:59.690 --> 03:24:59.700 align:start position:0%
all right other questions for yes
 
03:25:01.969 --> 03:25:01.979 align:start position:0%
representative Stapleton thank you Mr
 
03:25:03.349 --> 03:25:03.359 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
 
03:25:03.359 --> 03:25:05.330 align:start position:0%
chair and thank you for taking my
question

03:25:05.330 --> 03:25:05.340 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:25:05.340 --> 03:25:06.229 align:start position:0%
question
um

03:25:06.229 --> 03:25:06.239 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:25:09.410 --> 03:25:09.420 align:start position:0%
of course the the header on this bill on
 
03:25:12.170 --> 03:25:12.180 align:start position:0%
on the page one involuntary admissions
 
03:25:14.690 --> 03:25:14.700 align:start position:0%
says a lot
 
03:25:16.729 --> 03:25:16.739 align:start position:0%
um but it would seemed to me it would be
 
03:25:20.389 --> 03:25:20.399 align:start position:0%
clearer on line four if the Indigent
 
03:25:22.790 --> 03:25:22.800 align:start position:0%
client or person sought to be admitted
 
03:25:25.729 --> 03:25:25.739 align:start position:0%
the word indigent might make it clear
 
03:25:25.739 --> 03:25:27.530 align:start position:0%
the word indigent might make it clear
unless

03:25:27.530 --> 03:25:27.540 align:start position:0%
unless
 
03:25:30.590 --> 03:25:30.600 align:start position:0%
under Section 135
 
03:25:33.710 --> 03:25:33.720 align:start position:0%
C and any number of them it's already
 
03:25:36.950 --> 03:25:36.960 align:start position:0%
made clear in context which within which
 
03:25:39.769 --> 03:25:39.779 align:start position:0%
this appears and I'd pull it up here but
 
03:25:41.690 --> 03:25:41.700 align:start position:0%
there's a lot there and I I don't know
 
03:25:44.210 --> 03:25:44.220 align:start position:0%
I'm not familiar with the statute is the
 
03:25:48.710 --> 03:25:48.720 align:start position:0%
context for industry already in 135. we
 
03:25:50.630 --> 03:25:50.640 align:start position:0%
will build it into this section I think
 
03:25:52.429 --> 03:25:52.439 align:start position:0%
in the in terms of the amendment that's
 
03:25:55.130 --> 03:25:55.140 align:start position:0%
being requested so we would reference
 
03:25:57.590 --> 03:25:57.600 align:start position:0%
indigency and then give office a Cost
 
03:25:59.510 --> 03:25:59.520 align:start position:0%
Containment Authority
 
03:26:02.210 --> 03:26:02.220 align:start position:0%
so it is referenced I will need to add
 
03:26:04.070 --> 03:26:04.080 align:start position:0%
that in in the proposed in the amendment
 
03:26:11.750 --> 03:26:11.760 align:start position:0%
 
03:26:14.570 --> 03:26:14.580 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative thank
 
03:26:17.210 --> 03:26:17.220 align:start position:0%
you um is it it sees that the the
 
03:26:20.630 --> 03:26:20.640 align:start position:0%
increases fiscal year 24 and 25 was was
 
03:26:21.889 --> 03:26:21.899 align:start position:0%
there any
 
03:26:23.570 --> 03:26:23.580 align:start position:0%
um additional appropriation put into the
 
03:26:26.269 --> 03:26:26.279 align:start position:0%
budget for any of this
 
03:26:28.610 --> 03:26:28.620 align:start position:0%
uh at least not in the judicial uh
 
03:26:30.950 --> 03:26:30.960 align:start position:0%
branches budget no okay so this would be
 
03:26:32.269 --> 03:26:32.279 align:start position:0%
an additional
 
03:26:35.330 --> 03:26:35.340 align:start position:0%
increase should it pass or do you do you
 
03:26:37.010 --> 03:26:37.020 align:start position:0%
feel like you would be adequately funded
 
03:26:39.170 --> 03:26:39.180 align:start position:0%
to if we pass this
 
03:26:41.210 --> 03:26:41.220 align:start position:0%
as amended that you would be able to
 
03:26:42.769 --> 03:26:42.779 align:start position:0%
absorb the funding for fiscal year 24
 
03:26:44.809 --> 03:26:44.819 align:start position:0%
and 25.
 
03:26:47.570 --> 03:26:47.580 align:start position:0%
um I don't I think fiscal year 24 yes I
 
03:26:49.969 --> 03:26:49.979 align:start position:0%
don't know about 25 in terms of the the
 
03:26:51.710 --> 03:26:51.720 align:start position:0%
grant money that currently exists I
 
03:26:54.469 --> 03:26:54.479 align:start position:0%
don't know it's it's uh burn rate in
 
03:26:57.229 --> 03:26:57.239 align:start position:0%
terms of when that's likely to expire it
 
03:26:58.490 --> 03:26:58.500 align:start position:0%
may be through that period of time I
 
03:27:02.330 --> 03:27:02.340 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:04.370 --> 03:27:04.380 align:start position:0%
that would be helpful for me at least to
 
03:27:09.469 --> 03:27:09.479 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:12.650 --> 03:27:12.660 align:start position:0%
other questions for Mr hey
 
03:27:15.110 --> 03:27:15.120 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you
 
03:27:38.450 --> 03:27:38.460 align:start position:0%
 
03:27:40.070 --> 03:27:40.080 align:start position:0%
good afternoon
 
03:27:41.990 --> 03:27:42.000 align:start position:0%
uh chairman Lynn members of the

03:27:50.870 --> 03:27:50.880 align:start position:0%
organization
 
03:27:55.190 --> 03:27:55.200 align:start position:0%
that supports folks through support
 
03:27:57.950 --> 03:27:57.960 align:start position:0%
education and advocacy in the community
 
03:28:01.010 --> 03:28:01.020 align:start position:0%
and I'm here today on behalf of nominee
 
03:28:03.349 --> 03:28:03.359 align:start position:0%
Hampshire and supported this bill
 
03:28:07.130 --> 03:28:07.140 align:start position:0%
um although it's it's referenced as just
 
03:28:09.170 --> 03:28:09.180 align:start position:0%
an administrative bill when I took a
 
03:28:12.849 --> 03:28:12.859 align:start position:0%
look at the statutes myself
 
03:28:16.269 --> 03:28:16.279 align:start position:0%
realize that it does say
 
03:28:18.469 --> 03:28:18.479 align:start position:0%
135-c23 which is what this amends is
 
03:28:19.910 --> 03:28:19.920 align:start position:0%
that the client or person sought to be
 
03:28:22.010 --> 03:28:22.020 align:start position:0%
admitted shall pay the cost of the legal
 
03:28:23.570 --> 03:28:23.580 align:start position:0%
services in connection with the hearings
 
03:28:26.870 --> 03:28:26.880 align:start position:0%
held under this chapter this bill does
 
03:28:29.410 --> 03:28:29.420 align:start position:0%
strike that language
 
03:28:32.030 --> 03:28:32.040 align:start position:0%
and so when I read through this it was
 
03:28:34.130 --> 03:28:34.140 align:start position:0%
unclear whether somebody who was indigen
 
03:28:36.349 --> 03:28:36.359 align:start position:0%
would be on the hook for paying for
 
03:28:39.650 --> 03:28:39.660 align:start position:0%
these services or not which is why we
 
03:28:41.150 --> 03:28:41.160 align:start position:0%
are certainly in support of this
 
03:28:43.729 --> 03:28:43.739 align:start position:0%
understand the concerns of the committee
 
03:28:47.090 --> 03:28:47.100 align:start position:0%
regarding folks that may have means to
 
03:28:50.269 --> 03:28:50.279 align:start position:0%
provide their own counsel but I also do
 
03:28:52.429 --> 03:28:52.439 align:start position:0%
you know think that you know like in the
 
03:28:54.710 --> 03:28:54.720 align:start position:0%
criminal justice system folks that can't
 
03:28:57.050 --> 03:28:57.060 align:start position:0%
afford their own Council usually do get
 
03:28:59.690 --> 03:28:59.700 align:start position:0%
their own counsel instead of relying on
 
03:29:01.790 --> 03:29:01.800 align:start position:0%
the state to appoint the the council for
 
03:29:03.469 --> 03:29:03.479 align:start position:0%
them so I think that's one thing to
 
03:29:07.010 --> 03:29:07.020 align:start position:0%
consider around this also too these are
 
03:29:09.170 --> 03:29:09.180 align:start position:0%
folks that are being held on an
 
03:29:11.870 --> 03:29:11.880 align:start position:0%
involuntary status and it could be
 
03:29:13.790 --> 03:29:13.800 align:start position:0%
somebody as simple as a neighbor who
 
03:29:15.710 --> 03:29:15.720 align:start position:0%
fills out the petition
 
03:29:18.050 --> 03:29:18.060 align:start position:0%
so unlike you know the criminal justice
 
03:29:20.030 --> 03:29:20.040 align:start position:0%
system where there's uh an officer
 
03:29:22.550 --> 03:29:22.560 align:start position:0%
involved or a a warrant is sought when
 
03:29:24.590 --> 03:29:24.600 align:start position:0%
somebody is arrested these are folks
 
03:29:25.969 --> 03:29:25.979 align:start position:0%
that it's just a simple petition that's
 
03:29:28.150 --> 03:29:28.160 align:start position:0%
filled out by anybody in the community
 
03:29:31.309 --> 03:29:31.319 align:start position:0%
and so even if somebody has the means to
 
03:29:33.590 --> 03:29:33.600 align:start position:0%
pay for an attorney it might be worth
 
03:29:35.750 --> 03:29:35.760 align:start position:0%
considering that fact because they might
 
03:29:40.030 --> 03:29:40.040 align:start position:0%
be being held against their will
 
03:29:43.849 --> 03:29:43.859 align:start position:0%
and then if that petition is denied and
 
03:29:45.830 --> 03:29:45.840 align:start position:0%
they have to pay for the legal counsel
 
03:29:48.050 --> 03:29:48.060 align:start position:0%
because their neighbor was angry with
 
03:29:51.170 --> 03:29:51.180 align:start position:0%
them for whatever reason
 
03:29:53.929 --> 03:29:53.939 align:start position:0%
um you know that may not be fair so it
 
03:29:55.670 --> 03:29:55.680 align:start position:0%
might be worth considering too that if
 
03:29:58.309 --> 03:29:58.319 align:start position:0%
the petition is denied maybe they are
 
03:29:59.950 --> 03:29:59.960 align:start position:0%
entitled to
 
03:30:02.870 --> 03:30:02.880 align:start position:0%
Legal Services as paid for by the the
 
03:30:05.210 --> 03:30:05.220 align:start position:0%
state since anybody can fill out a
 
03:30:07.550 --> 03:30:07.560 align:start position:0%
petition and those were just my thoughts
 
03:30:08.990 --> 03:30:09.000 align:start position:0%
it doesn't really speak to my testimony
 
03:30:10.429 --> 03:30:10.439 align:start position:0%
you have that but those are just my
 
03:30:12.410 --> 03:30:12.420 align:start position:0%
thoughts that I had as I was hearing the
 
03:30:14.269 --> 03:30:14.279 align:start position:0%
questions that you folks had so with
 
03:30:15.710 --> 03:30:15.720 align:start position:0%
that I will
 
03:30:17.570 --> 03:30:17.580 align:start position:0%
take any questions
 
03:30:19.610 --> 03:30:19.620 align:start position:0%
you know what one question that I'm
 
03:30:22.370 --> 03:30:22.380 align:start position:0%
sorry other other members have questions
 
03:30:24.769 --> 03:30:24.779 align:start position:0%
before I ask a question
 
03:30:26.630 --> 03:30:26.640 align:start position:0%
all right so I guess one question I had
 
03:30:28.309 --> 03:30:28.319 align:start position:0%
and I didn't ask Mr head about this
 
03:30:30.170 --> 03:30:30.180 align:start position:0%
because it didn't occur to me but
 
03:30:30.180 --> 03:30:32.570 align:start position:0%
because it didn't occur to me but
um

03:30:32.570 --> 03:30:32.580 align:start position:0%
 
03:30:35.950 --> 03:30:35.960 align:start position:0%
as I read the language here
 
03:30:40.429 --> 03:30:40.439 align:start position:0%
again it it seems to suggest that if a
 
03:30:44.030 --> 03:30:44.040 align:start position:0%
person doesn't have counsel
 
03:30:44.040 --> 03:30:44.929 align:start position:0%
person doesn't have counsel
um

03:30:44.929 --> 03:30:44.939 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:30:48.590 --> 03:30:48.600 align:start position:0%
they get counsel and and I guess my only
 
03:30:50.210 --> 03:30:50.220 align:start position:0%
question and again I understand that
 
03:30:51.650 --> 03:30:51.660 align:start position:0%
this would be the the
 
03:30:54.229 --> 03:30:54.239 align:start position:0%
you know the minority of cases maybe the
 
03:30:57.290 --> 03:30:57.300 align:start position:0%
small minority but
 
03:31:01.370 --> 03:31:01.380 align:start position:0%
sort of the Assumption there is that if
 
03:31:04.429 --> 03:31:04.439 align:start position:0%
a person doesn't have counsel they don't
 
03:31:06.469 --> 03:31:06.479 align:start position:0%
have the ability to waive the right to
 
03:31:08.570 --> 03:31:08.580 align:start position:0%
counsel and probably true they're not
 
03:31:10.910 --> 03:31:10.920 align:start position:0%
for many for the vast majority that
 
03:31:13.250 --> 03:31:13.260 align:start position:0%
there may not be confident to waive the
 
03:31:14.870 --> 03:31:14.880 align:start position:0%
right to council but
 
03:31:17.510 --> 03:31:17.520 align:start position:0%
presumably not all of these cases
 
03:31:19.070 --> 03:31:19.080 align:start position:0%
involve somebody
 
03:31:19.080 --> 03:31:20.450 align:start position:0%
involve somebody
who

03:31:20.450 --> 03:31:20.460 align:start position:0%
who
 
03:31:22.969 --> 03:31:22.979 align:start position:0%
you know should in fact be involuntarily
 
03:31:24.410 --> 03:31:24.420 align:start position:0%
committed maybe some of them are really
 
03:31:25.969 --> 03:31:25.979 align:start position:0%
they shouldn't be unvoluntarily
 
03:31:27.950 --> 03:31:27.960 align:start position:0%
committed and if they shouldn't be
 
03:31:29.630 --> 03:31:29.640 align:start position:0%
involuntarily committed maybe that also
 
03:31:31.370 --> 03:31:31.380 align:start position:0%
means that they have the right to make
 
03:31:32.990 --> 03:31:33.000 align:start position:0%
their own decision as to whether they
 
03:31:36.050 --> 03:31:36.060 align:start position:0%
should have counsel or not so I mean do
 
03:31:37.670 --> 03:31:37.680 align:start position:0%
you think that they should somebody in
 
03:31:40.309 --> 03:31:40.319 align:start position:0%
this situation should not be able to
 
03:31:43.010 --> 03:31:43.020 align:start position:0%
waive the right to council if the court
 
03:31:44.929 --> 03:31:44.939 align:start position:0%
determines that they're competent to do
 
03:31:44.939 --> 03:31:49.630 align:start position:0%
determines that they're competent to do
that

03:31:49.630 --> 03:31:49.640 align:start position:0%
 
03:31:52.010 --> 03:31:52.020 align:start position:0%
that's a good question that I would love
 
03:31:53.570 --> 03:31:53.580 align:start position:0%
to take back and think about and talk
 
03:31:56.929 --> 03:31:56.939 align:start position:0%
with folks on our committee or at least
 
03:31:59.090 --> 03:31:59.100 align:start position:0%
my executive director Susan Stearns and
 
03:32:01.250 --> 03:32:01.260 align:start position:0%
get back to you but it is an interesting
 
03:32:02.809 --> 03:32:02.819 align:start position:0%
question because if the court determines
 
03:32:05.210 --> 03:32:05.220 align:start position:0%
that the person
 
03:32:08.750 --> 03:32:08.760 align:start position:0%
um you know denies the the petition then
 
03:32:10.790 --> 03:32:10.800 align:start position:0%
I guess you could say that they have the
 
03:32:12.229 --> 03:32:12.239 align:start position:0%
right to waive Council but if they
 
03:32:13.910 --> 03:32:13.920 align:start position:0%
didn't have counsel there to help
 
03:32:15.769 --> 03:32:15.779 align:start position:0%
represent them
 
03:32:18.710 --> 03:32:18.720 align:start position:0%
it's it's really you know it's a you're
 
03:32:20.450 --> 03:32:20.460 align:start position:0%
making a determination after they
 
03:32:22.550 --> 03:32:22.560 align:start position:0%
haven't had counsel
 
03:32:24.769 --> 03:32:24.779 align:start position:0%
because you can't
 
03:32:26.929 --> 03:32:26.939 align:start position:0%
do you know what I mean no I do I do
 
03:32:31.010 --> 03:32:31.020 align:start position:0%
 
03:32:32.570 --> 03:32:32.580 align:start position:0%
I I do know what you mean I think and
 
03:32:34.790 --> 03:32:34.800 align:start position:0%
again I you know maybe maybe this is
 
03:32:37.370 --> 03:32:37.380 align:start position:0%
more hypothetical than a real situation
 
03:32:41.090 --> 03:32:41.100 align:start position:0%
but it does it it does sort of trouble
 
03:32:43.550 --> 03:32:43.560 align:start position:0%
me that
 
03:32:45.530 --> 03:32:45.540 align:start position:0%
you know it's one I know that in the
 
03:32:47.450 --> 03:32:47.460 align:start position:0%
juvenile area we have a there's a couple
 
03:32:50.269 --> 03:32:50.279 align:start position:0%
of statutes that say that basically say
 
03:32:52.429 --> 03:32:52.439 align:start position:0%
a juvenile can't waive the right to
 
03:32:55.190 --> 03:32:55.200 align:start position:0%
council and with a juvenile that does
 
03:32:57.590 --> 03:32:57.600 align:start position:0%
make sense to me
 
03:32:57.600 --> 03:32:58.190 align:start position:0%
make sense to me
um

03:32:58.190 --> 03:32:58.200 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:32:58.200 --> 03:32:59.570 align:start position:0%
um
but

03:32:59.570 --> 03:32:59.580 align:start position:0%
but
 
03:33:01.490 --> 03:33:01.500 align:start position:0%
if you're talking here about a person
 
03:33:03.889 --> 03:33:03.899 align:start position:0%
that's an adult I mean what if you had
 
03:33:06.590 --> 03:33:06.600 align:start position:0%
somebody that you know that the court
 
03:33:09.229 --> 03:33:09.239 align:start position:0%
was satisfied after look seeing the
 
03:33:11.269 --> 03:33:11.279 align:start position:0%
person and having some interaction with
 
03:33:13.490 --> 03:33:13.500 align:start position:0%
the person that the person was competent
 
03:33:15.170 --> 03:33:15.180 align:start position:0%
to make a decision whether or not they
 
03:33:17.570 --> 03:33:17.580 align:start position:0%
wanted counsel and said I don't want
 
03:33:19.729 --> 03:33:19.739 align:start position:0%
counsel in that circumstance it would
 
03:33:21.830 --> 03:33:21.840 align:start position:0%
seem to me to be
 
03:33:24.110 --> 03:33:24.120 align:start position:0%
you know at least
 
03:33:26.330 --> 03:33:26.340 align:start position:0%
somewhat untoward for the court to say
 
03:33:27.769 --> 03:33:27.779 align:start position:0%
no you're getting an attorney whether
 
03:33:30.290 --> 03:33:30.300 align:start position:0%
you want one or not and I just um I I
 
03:33:34.370 --> 03:33:34.380 align:start position:0%
did print out 135-c uh colon 22 as well
 
03:33:36.950 --> 03:33:36.960 align:start position:0%
and I just looked at that and it does
 
03:33:38.570 --> 03:33:38.580 align:start position:0%
say the right to legal counsel for any
 
03:33:40.550 --> 03:33:40.560 align:start position:0%
client or person sought to be admitted
 
03:33:42.710 --> 03:33:42.720 align:start position:0%
during any judicial proceeding conducted
 
03:33:45.349 --> 03:33:45.359 align:start position:0%
under this chapter shall be waived only
 
03:33:47.690 --> 03:33:47.700 align:start position:0%
if the person only excuse me only if the
 
03:33:49.490 --> 03:33:49.500 align:start position:0%
client or person sought to be admitted
 
03:33:52.309 --> 03:33:52.319 align:start position:0%
makes an informed decision to do so I
 
03:33:53.929 --> 03:33:53.939 align:start position:0%
don't know who makes that decision but
 
03:33:55.790 --> 03:33:55.800 align:start position:0%
there is a provision for waiving counsel
 
03:33:55.800 --> 03:33:57.309 align:start position:0%
there is a provision for waiving counsel
in

03:33:57.309 --> 03:33:57.319 align:start position:0%
in
 
03:33:57.319 --> 03:33:59.229 align:start position:0%
in
uh

03:33:59.229 --> 03:33:59.239 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:01.610 --> 03:34:01.620 align:start position:0%
135-sequel in 22 which is the provision
 
03:34:03.530 --> 03:34:03.540 align:start position:0%
right before this one right and I guess
 
03:34:05.450 --> 03:34:05.460 align:start position:0%
what right I mean so that and that makes
 
03:34:07.670 --> 03:34:07.680 align:start position:0%
sense that I didn't see that statue but
 
03:34:09.050 --> 03:34:09.060 align:start position:0%
that makes perfect sense that it should
 
03:34:12.590 --> 03:34:12.600 align:start position:0%
say that I guess I'm only wondering then
 
03:34:16.010 --> 03:34:16.020 align:start position:0%
is is the language in 23 at least some
 
03:34:18.110 --> 03:34:18.120 align:start position:0%
at least arguably inconsistent with what
 
03:34:20.210 --> 03:34:20.220 align:start position:0%
22 says
 
03:34:21.950 --> 03:34:21.960 align:start position:0%
um you know should there be some
 
03:34:25.250 --> 03:34:25.260 align:start position:0%
language in in 23 that says you know I'm
 
03:34:25.260 --> 03:34:26.510 align:start position:0%
language in in 23 that says you know I'm
uh

03:34:26.510 --> 03:34:26.520 align:start position:0%
uh
 
03:34:29.510 --> 03:34:29.520 align:start position:0%
does not have Lee does not have legal
 
03:34:33.349 --> 03:34:33.359 align:start position:0%
counsel and Council has not been
 
03:34:36.170 --> 03:34:36.180 align:start position:0%
and the court finds that Council has not
 
03:34:38.510 --> 03:34:38.520 align:start position:0%
knowingly and intelligently been waived
 
03:34:40.849 --> 03:34:40.859 align:start position:0%
or something like that yeah I mean I
 
03:34:43.550 --> 03:34:43.560 align:start position:0%
think even a reference to this the uh
 
03:34:45.950 --> 03:34:45.960 align:start position:0%
provision before right before might
 
03:34:48.590 --> 03:34:48.600 align:start position:0%
might work as well all right all right
 
03:34:51.170 --> 03:34:51.180 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
 
03:34:51.180 --> 03:34:52.490 align:start position:0%
thank you other questions for this
Witness

03:34:52.490 --> 03:34:52.500 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
03:34:55.610 --> 03:34:55.620 align:start position:0%
right oh yes representative Stapleton
 
03:34:58.370 --> 03:34:58.380 align:start position:0%
uh just following up on that interesting
 
03:35:02.870 --> 03:35:02.880 align:start position:0%
discussion with one in 135 C 22
 
03:35:07.130 --> 03:35:07.140 align:start position:0%
the word informed decision has got to be
 
03:35:09.530 --> 03:35:09.540 align:start position:0%
key in that how that's interpreted would
 
03:35:11.389 --> 03:35:11.399 align:start position:0%
the judge provide
 
03:35:15.050 --> 03:35:15.060 align:start position:0%
that informed or an assigned attorney
 
03:35:18.710 --> 03:35:18.720 align:start position:0%
someone of capability uh would would
 
03:35:18.720 --> 03:35:19.750 align:start position:0%
someone of capability uh would would
probably

03:35:19.750 --> 03:35:19.760 align:start position:0%
probably
 
03:35:23.330 --> 03:35:23.340 align:start position:0%
perform that function to inform the
 
03:35:26.150 --> 03:35:26.160 align:start position:0%
client or person in order to make the
 
03:35:26.160 --> 03:35:27.110 align:start position:0%
client or person in order to make the
decision

03:35:27.110 --> 03:35:27.120 align:start position:0%
decision
 
03:35:32.030 --> 03:35:32.040 align:start position:0%
is that possible or an interpretation a
 
03:35:36.590 --> 03:35:36.600 align:start position:0%
 
03:35:39.170 --> 03:35:39.180 align:start position:0%
I would say yes this statute doesn't
 
03:35:41.349 --> 03:35:41.359 align:start position:0%
make references to who that person is
 
03:35:44.389 --> 03:35:44.399 align:start position:0%
but I do you know have a lot of faith in
 
03:35:46.370 --> 03:35:46.380 align:start position:0%
the judges in our state to make those
 
03:35:48.290 --> 03:35:48.300 align:start position:0%
kinds of determinations
 
03:35:50.570 --> 03:35:50.580 align:start position:0%
um they make non-competency decisions
 
03:35:53.030 --> 03:35:53.040 align:start position:0%
all the time so I think that that they
 
03:35:55.010 --> 03:35:55.020 align:start position:0%
would be capable of doing that and I did
 
03:35:56.769 --> 03:35:56.779 align:start position:0%
also want to just mention that we would
 
03:36:00.170 --> 03:36:00.180 align:start position:0%
also be in support of a provision that
 
03:36:01.790 --> 03:36:01.800 align:start position:0%
carved out people that were able to
 
03:36:04.190 --> 03:36:04.200 align:start position:0%
afford their own Council that's
 
03:36:05.990 --> 03:36:06.000 align:start position:0%
something that we would also support too
 
03:36:06.000 --> 03:36:07.429 align:start position:0%
something that we would also support too
so

03:36:07.429 --> 03:36:07.439 align:start position:0%
so
 
03:36:09.469 --> 03:36:09.479 align:start position:0%
well it sounds like Mr hedge is going to
 
03:36:10.490 --> 03:36:10.500 align:start position:0%
be able to come up with some language
 
03:36:12.889 --> 03:36:12.899 align:start position:0%
and maybe we'll we'll toy around with
 
03:36:14.690 --> 03:36:14.700 align:start position:0%
the making sure that it's clear that
 
03:36:14.700 --> 03:36:15.490 align:start position:0%
the making sure that it's clear that
that

03:36:15.490 --> 03:36:15.500 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:36:19.610 --> 03:36:19.620 align:start position:0%
120 that the waiver provision of 122
 
03:36:22.550 --> 03:36:22.560 align:start position:0%
sort of applies here also and we will we
 
03:36:24.410 --> 03:36:24.420 align:start position:0%
can figure out the language to to do
 
03:36:28.309 --> 03:36:28.319 align:start position:0%
that follow-up yes uh so we may have
 
03:36:30.830 --> 03:36:30.840 align:start position:0%
inadvertently found a little weakness in
 
03:36:36.290 --> 03:36:36.300 align:start position:0%
the last uh sentence of uh 135 c22 with
 
03:36:38.090 --> 03:36:38.100 align:start position:0%
the word informed if if it could be
 
03:36:41.030 --> 03:36:41.040 align:start position:0%
further qualified that would be probably
 
03:36:42.530 --> 03:36:42.540 align:start position:0%
be helpful
 
03:36:46.250 --> 03:36:46.260 align:start position:0%
um as to who provides that inform
 
03:36:51.710 --> 03:36:51.720 align:start position:0%
 
03:36:53.269 --> 03:36:53.279 align:start position:0%
other questions
 
03:36:55.130 --> 03:36:55.140 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
03:36:57.650 --> 03:36:57.660 align:start position:0%
you I'm next going to call on Richard
 
03:36:57.660 --> 03:37:06.110 align:start position:0%
you I'm next going to call on Richard
samphrel

03:37:06.110 --> 03:37:06.120 align:start position:0%
 
03:37:09.290 --> 03:37:09.300 align:start position:0%
good afternoon uh Mr chairman uh members
 
03:37:10.670 --> 03:37:10.680 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Richard Sam
 
03:37:13.550 --> 03:37:13.560 align:start position:0%
Peril I am the acting administrative I'm
 
03:37:15.590 --> 03:37:15.600 align:start position:0%
sorry the acting executive director of
 
03:37:18.010 --> 03:37:18.020 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire judicial Council
 
03:37:21.190 --> 03:37:21.200 align:start position:0%
as attorney head was saying earlier the
 
03:37:23.750 --> 03:37:23.760 align:start position:0%
judicial council is not part of the
 
03:37:25.849 --> 03:37:25.859 align:start position:0%
judicial branch of government
 
03:37:25.859 --> 03:37:26.809 align:start position:0%
judicial branch of government
um

03:37:26.809 --> 03:37:26.819 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:37:30.410 --> 03:37:30.420 align:start position:0%
sure uh the judicial council is not part
 
03:37:32.690 --> 03:37:32.700 align:start position:0%
of the judicial branch it's a separate
 
03:37:34.030 --> 03:37:34.040 align:start position:0%
state agency
 
03:37:36.410 --> 03:37:36.420 align:start position:0%
and our one of our principal
 
03:37:38.809 --> 03:37:38.819 align:start position:0%
responsibilities is the oversighted
 
03:37:42.530 --> 03:37:42.540 align:start position:0%
payment of funds from Indigent defense
 
03:37:42.540 --> 03:37:43.729 align:start position:0%
payment of funds from Indigent defense
funds

03:37:43.729 --> 03:37:43.739 align:start position:0%
funds
 
03:37:46.309 --> 03:37:46.319 align:start position:0%
so I think there are three areas in this
 
03:37:49.550 --> 03:37:49.560 align:start position:0%
bill that sort of draw our attention as
 
03:37:51.769 --> 03:37:51.779 align:start position:0%
representative Smith was pointing out
 
03:37:51.779 --> 03:37:52.929 align:start position:0%
representative Smith was pointing out
earlier

03:37:52.929 --> 03:37:52.939 align:start position:0%
earlier
 
03:37:56.990 --> 03:37:57.000 align:start position:0%
there is no existing accounting line in
 
03:38:01.070 --> 03:38:01.080 align:start position:0%
our agency for payment from this area so
 
03:38:02.510 --> 03:38:02.520 align:start position:0%
there would need to be some sort of
 
03:38:06.710 --> 03:38:06.720 align:start position:0%
transfer of funds to do that it's not
 
03:38:08.870 --> 03:38:08.880 align:start position:0%
part of the budget that has been
 
03:38:12.110 --> 03:38:12.120 align:start position:0%
proposed by our agency
 
03:38:15.769 --> 03:38:15.779 align:start position:0%
so in terms of the cost here you can see
 
03:38:17.510 --> 03:38:17.520 align:start position:0%
that there's a minimum cost and a
 
03:38:19.429 --> 03:38:19.439 align:start position:0%
maximum cost I'd also point out to you
 
03:38:21.469 --> 03:38:21.479 align:start position:0%
that in the methodology there's a
 
03:38:24.110 --> 03:38:24.120 align:start position:0%
reference to the costs that Department
 
03:38:25.729 --> 03:38:25.739 align:start position:0%
of Health and Human Services had
 
03:38:27.889 --> 03:38:27.899 align:start position:0%
attributed to this and they put it at
 
03:38:29.570 --> 03:38:29.580 align:start position:0%
approximately nine hundred thousand
 
03:38:32.030 --> 03:38:32.040 align:start position:0%
dollars so to the extent that this
 
03:38:34.130 --> 03:38:34.140 align:start position:0%
responsibility becomes part of the
 
03:38:36.050 --> 03:38:36.060 align:start position:0%
judicial council's
 
03:38:36.060 --> 03:38:36.950 align:start position:0%
judicial council's
um

03:38:36.950 --> 03:38:36.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:38:40.370 --> 03:38:40.380 align:start position:0%
area of payment we would need some sort
 
03:38:42.650 --> 03:38:42.660 align:start position:0%
of source of funding to actually pay for
 
03:38:45.130 --> 03:38:45.140 align:start position:0%
this second
 
03:38:47.870 --> 03:38:47.880 align:start position:0%
the anticipated
 
03:38:50.630 --> 03:38:50.640 align:start position:0%
costs associated with this bill are not
 
03:38:53.630 --> 03:38:53.640 align:start position:0%
limited in the language to merely the
 
03:38:55.370 --> 03:38:55.380 align:start position:0%
cost of counsel it also refers to
 
03:38:58.070 --> 03:38:58.080 align:start position:0%
services and expenses related to
 
03:39:00.590 --> 03:39:00.600 align:start position:0%
representation it doesn't seem as though
 
03:39:02.630 --> 03:39:02.640 align:start position:0%
there's any estimates available for
 
03:39:04.370 --> 03:39:04.380 align:start position:0%
those costs and I don't know that there
 
03:39:06.290 --> 03:39:06.300 align:start position:0%
are many but that would in my
 
03:39:08.630 --> 03:39:08.640 align:start position:0%
understanding include expert testimony
 
03:39:11.050 --> 03:39:11.060 align:start position:0%
other Witnesses
 
03:39:15.170 --> 03:39:15.180 align:start position:0%
like that transcription costs and that
 
03:39:17.990 --> 03:39:18.000 align:start position:0%
amount is not included in any sort of
 
03:39:19.510 --> 03:39:19.520 align:start position:0%
estimate that's
 
03:39:23.630 --> 03:39:23.640 align:start position:0%
included within the fiscal impact of the
 
03:39:24.950 --> 03:39:24.960 align:start position:0%
bill here
 
03:39:26.929 --> 03:39:26.939 align:start position:0%
and third and one of my greatest
 
03:39:29.630 --> 03:39:29.640 align:start position:0%
concerns is the administrative costs to
 
03:39:31.910 --> 03:39:31.920 align:start position:0%
the agency in taking on this new
 
03:39:34.250 --> 03:39:34.260 align:start position:0%
responsibility I certainly understand
 
03:39:38.450 --> 03:39:38.460 align:start position:0%
from other agencies and other branches
 
03:39:40.729 --> 03:39:40.739 align:start position:0%
of government's perspective that the
 
03:39:42.229 --> 03:39:42.239 align:start position:0%
judicial Council may be the most
 
03:39:44.150 --> 03:39:44.160 align:start position:0%
appropriate source for payment of
 
03:39:47.269 --> 03:39:47.279 align:start position:0%
certain expenses we're a very small
 
03:39:49.670 --> 03:39:49.680 align:start position:0%
agency there's an executive director and
 
03:39:51.429 --> 03:39:51.439 align:start position:0%
there's two staff members
 
03:39:54.610 --> 03:39:54.620 align:start position:0%
we have seen a shifting of
 
03:39:57.429 --> 03:39:57.439 align:start position:0%
responsibilities in the last
 
03:40:00.550 --> 03:40:00.560 align:start position:0%
biennium to our agency
 
03:40:04.610 --> 03:40:04.620 align:start position:0%
and this is now in another shift to the
 
03:40:07.790 --> 03:40:07.800 align:start position:0%
judicial Council which is fine if the
 
03:40:11.030 --> 03:40:11.040 align:start position:0%
legislature deems that were our agency
 
03:40:12.950 --> 03:40:12.960 align:start position:0%
is the appropriate agency to pay this
 
03:40:16.130 --> 03:40:16.140 align:start position:0%
but it is creating a strain on the
 
03:40:19.190 --> 03:40:19.200 align:start position:0%
agency in terms of the people and the
 
03:40:21.710 --> 03:40:21.720 align:start position:0%
space available to actually perform this
 
03:40:24.170 --> 03:40:24.180 align:start position:0%
function so I bring that to your
 
03:40:27.469 --> 03:40:27.479 align:start position:0%
attention because is um you know as an
 
03:40:30.349 --> 03:40:30.359 align:start position:0%
interim director I come in and I sort of
 
03:40:33.050 --> 03:40:33.060 align:start position:0%
see what's going on and I see two people
 
03:40:34.849 --> 03:40:34.859 align:start position:0%
who were basically processing all the
 
03:40:38.809 --> 03:40:38.819 align:start position:0%
bills that this agency gets and shifting
 
03:40:40.790 --> 03:40:40.800 align:start position:0%
another category of expense to them
 
03:40:43.190 --> 03:40:43.200 align:start position:0%
concerns me I won't be around to have to
 
03:40:46.070 --> 03:40:46.080 align:start position:0%
deal with it but my successor will and
 
03:40:48.590 --> 03:40:48.600 align:start position:0%
the people who work there will so I am
 
03:40:50.389 --> 03:40:50.399 align:start position:0%
also concerned with the administrative
 
03:40:52.910 --> 03:40:52.920 align:start position:0%
expenses that are that this kind of
 
03:40:56.870 --> 03:40:56.880 align:start position:0%
shift in other areas as well creates the
 
03:40:56.880 --> 03:40:59.690 align:start position:0%
shift in other areas as well creates the
agency

03:40:59.690 --> 03:40:59.700 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:01.790 --> 03:41:01.800 align:start position:0%
yeah I'm sorry anything else that you
 
03:41:03.050 --> 03:41:03.060 align:start position:0%
want no I'm happy to take questions
 
03:41:06.290 --> 03:41:06.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:41:08.510 --> 03:41:08.520 align:start position:0%
thank you very much
 
03:41:10.130 --> 03:41:10.140 align:start position:0%
um it's been a few years since I've
 
03:41:12.170 --> 03:41:12.180 align:start position:0%
served on the judicial Council and
 
03:41:14.150 --> 03:41:14.160 align:start position:0%
perhaps things have changed dramatically
 
03:41:16.070 --> 03:41:16.080 align:start position:0%
but I doubt if they have
 
03:41:19.250 --> 03:41:19.260 align:start position:0%
in that the judicial Council has always
 
03:41:19.260 --> 03:41:20.570 align:start position:0%
in that the judicial Council has always
struggled

03:41:20.570 --> 03:41:20.580 align:start position:0%
struggled
 
03:41:24.889 --> 03:41:24.899 align:start position:0%
for enough resources to carry out the
 
03:41:28.010 --> 03:41:28.020 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that this body
 
03:41:28.020 --> 03:41:29.570 align:start position:0%
responsibilities that this body
um

03:41:29.570 --> 03:41:29.580 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:41:33.969 --> 03:41:33.979 align:start position:0%
sends to them and uh
 
03:41:36.830 --> 03:41:36.840 align:start position:0%
Judy schedule has to go with some
 
03:41:39.170 --> 03:41:39.180 align:start position:0%
frequency to the fiscal committee to ask
 
03:41:42.590 --> 03:41:42.600 align:start position:0%
for more money than had uh otherwise
 
03:41:44.929 --> 03:41:44.939 align:start position:0%
been appropriated
 
03:41:47.750 --> 03:41:47.760 align:start position:0%
this bill takes effect
 
03:41:50.710 --> 03:41:50.720 align:start position:0%
60 days after Passage
 
03:41:53.150 --> 03:41:53.160 align:start position:0%
there was no mention
 
03:41:56.630 --> 03:41:56.640 align:start position:0%
in the budget to my knowledge and I
 
03:41:59.030 --> 03:41:59.040 align:start position:0%
think that's now been confirmed on the
 
03:42:02.570 --> 03:42:02.580 align:start position:0%
part of HHS the judicial Council or the
 
03:42:05.030 --> 03:42:05.040 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
 
03:42:05.040 --> 03:42:06.950 align:start position:0%
judicial branch
um

03:42:06.950 --> 03:42:06.960 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:09.469 --> 03:42:09.479 align:start position:0%
and this is a question
 
03:42:09.479 --> 03:42:10.250 align:start position:0%
and this is a question
um

03:42:10.250 --> 03:42:10.260 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:42:13.090 --> 03:42:13.100 align:start position:0%
do you see a way
 
03:42:17.870 --> 03:42:17.880 align:start position:0%
that within 60 days after passage even
 
03:42:20.870 --> 03:42:20.880 align:start position:0%
understanding there may be arpa funds
 
03:42:20.880 --> 03:42:22.670 align:start position:0%
understanding there may be arpa funds
available

03:42:22.670 --> 03:42:22.680 align:start position:0%
available
 
03:42:22.680 --> 03:42:24.349 align:start position:0%
available
for

03:42:24.349 --> 03:42:24.359 align:start position:0%
for
 
03:42:26.870 --> 03:42:26.880 align:start position:0%
an agency the size of the judicial
 
03:42:26.880 --> 03:42:28.250 align:start position:0%
an agency the size of the judicial
Council

03:42:28.250 --> 03:42:28.260 align:start position:0%
Council
 
03:42:31.790 --> 03:42:31.800 align:start position:0%
to be able to have the staff and the
 
03:42:33.950 --> 03:42:33.960 align:start position:0%
necessary funding
 
03:42:35.929 --> 03:42:35.939 align:start position:0%
to carry out
 
03:42:38.690 --> 03:42:38.700 align:start position:0%
an essential service
 
03:42:42.170 --> 03:42:42.180 align:start position:0%
for a couple thousand people who are
 
03:42:45.309 --> 03:42:45.319 align:start position:0%
desperately in need of support
 
03:42:47.030 --> 03:42:47.040 align:start position:0%
Representatives thank you for the
 
03:42:47.040 --> 03:42:48.050 align:start position:0%
Representatives thank you for the
question

03:42:48.050 --> 03:42:48.060 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:42:51.050 --> 03:42:51.060 align:start position:0%
um you you're probably familiar with the
 
03:42:53.269 --> 03:42:53.279 align:start position:0%
statutory scheme set up by the Indigent
 
03:42:57.110 --> 03:42:57.120 align:start position:0%
defense fund which allows the agency to
 
03:42:59.389 --> 03:42:59.399 align:start position:0%
go to governor and Council and to the
 
03:43:02.570 --> 03:43:02.580 align:start position:0%
Joint uh fiscal committee to seek
 
03:43:04.370 --> 03:43:04.380 align:start position:0%
additional Appropriations
 
03:43:07.370 --> 03:43:07.380 align:start position:0%
so that would be I think the only
 
03:43:11.210 --> 03:43:11.220 align:start position:0%
methodology by which we would be able to
 
03:43:14.450 --> 03:43:14.460 align:start position:0%
secure any sort of additional funding it
 
03:43:16.190 --> 03:43:16.200 align:start position:0%
would be
 
03:43:16.200 --> 03:43:17.210 align:start position:0%
would be
um

03:43:17.210 --> 03:43:17.220 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:19.910 --> 03:43:19.920 align:start position:0%
in terms of the time frame of 60 days I
 
03:43:23.630 --> 03:43:23.640 align:start position:0%
think that's a fairly tight time frame
 
03:43:25.969 --> 03:43:25.979 align:start position:0%
um and but I can't think of any other
 
03:43:29.090 --> 03:43:29.100 align:start position:0%
way to receive funding other than that
 
03:43:30.950 --> 03:43:30.960 align:start position:0%
should I just doesn't want to thank you
 
03:43:32.870 --> 03:43:32.880 align:start position:0%
just one quick perhaps I should have
 
03:43:35.690 --> 03:43:35.700 align:start position:0%
asked Mr head this but
 
03:43:35.700 --> 03:43:37.330 align:start position:0%
asked Mr head this but
um

03:43:37.330 --> 03:43:37.340 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:43:41.510 --> 03:43:41.520 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:45.790 --> 03:43:45.800 align:start position:0%
do you see damage that could be done
 
03:43:50.150 --> 03:43:50.160 align:start position:0%
to the um the subjects of these
 
03:43:50.160 --> 03:43:53.290 align:start position:0%
to the um the subjects of these
involuntary

03:43:53.290 --> 03:43:53.300 align:start position:0%
 
03:43:55.570 --> 03:43:55.580 align:start position:0%
commitments if
 
03:43:59.750 --> 03:43:59.760 align:start position:0%
the legislature were to
 
03:43:59.760 --> 03:44:01.309 align:start position:0%
the legislature were to
pass

03:44:01.309 --> 03:44:01.319 align:start position:0%
pass
 
03:44:05.630 --> 03:44:05.640 align:start position:0%
take action to create this new procedure
 
03:44:07.729 --> 03:44:07.739 align:start position:0%
but not have it
 
03:44:09.769 --> 03:44:09.779 align:start position:0%
go into effect
 
03:44:13.910 --> 03:44:13.920 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:13.920 --> 03:44:14.690 align:start position:0%
 
um

03:44:14.690 --> 03:44:14.700 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:44:17.210 --> 03:44:17.220 align:start position:0%
if I understand your question correctly
 
03:44:20.750 --> 03:44:20.760 align:start position:0%
I think uh the delay in implementation
 
03:44:24.590 --> 03:44:24.600 align:start position:0%
would allow uh the judicial Council to
 
03:44:26.809 --> 03:44:26.819 align:start position:0%
include within its next budget request
 
03:44:29.690 --> 03:44:29.700 align:start position:0%
in the next biennium Provisions to allow
 
03:44:31.309 --> 03:44:31.319 align:start position:0%
this to
 
03:44:33.290 --> 03:44:33.300 align:start position:0%
to be executed
 
03:44:36.590 --> 03:44:36.600 align:start position:0%
um so I don't see any certainly from the
 
03:44:38.389 --> 03:44:38.399 align:start position:0%
perspective of my agency which would be
 
03:44:41.330 --> 03:44:41.340 align:start position:0%
paying the bills I don't see any uh harm
 
03:44:44.990 --> 03:44:45.000 align:start position:0%
to that because the statutes as
 
03:44:47.150 --> 03:44:47.160 align:start position:0%
currently written or authorized the
 
03:44:49.429 --> 03:44:49.439 align:start position:0%
court to appoint counsel the only issue
 
03:44:51.590 --> 03:44:51.600 align:start position:0%
is who would be doing the mechanics of
 
03:44:56.090 --> 03:44:56.100 align:start position:0%
 
03:44:58.130 --> 03:44:58.140 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
03:45:00.889 --> 03:45:00.899 align:start position:0%
Alexander um thank you Mr chair and I
 
03:45:02.389 --> 03:45:02.399 align:start position:0%
representative Smith asked a lot of what
 
03:45:04.790 --> 03:45:04.800 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask because we think a lot
 
03:45:04.800 --> 03:45:06.110 align:start position:0%
I wanted to ask because we think a lot
alike

03:45:06.110 --> 03:45:06.120 align:start position:0%
alike
 
03:45:08.450 --> 03:45:08.460 align:start position:0%
um do we do you feel as if we're putting
 
03:45:10.849 --> 03:45:10.859 align:start position:0%
the cart before the horse with regards
 
03:45:12.590 --> 03:45:12.600 align:start position:0%
to this funding and I guess I I don't
 
03:45:15.290 --> 03:45:15.300 align:start position:0%
want to like think of what the other
 
03:45:17.389 --> 03:45:17.399 align:start position:0%
body does but typically with budget
 
03:45:18.950 --> 03:45:18.960 align:start position:0%
requests they would table the bill in
 
03:45:21.170 --> 03:45:21.180 align:start position:0%
their house and then put it into the
 
03:45:23.750 --> 03:45:23.760 align:start position:0%
budget so I guess I'm under I'm I'm
 
03:45:25.309 --> 03:45:25.319 align:start position:0%
confused at the process of why they
 
03:45:26.750 --> 03:45:26.760 align:start position:0%
would send us a bill with a with a
 
03:45:29.269 --> 03:45:29.279 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact on it when they when they
 
03:45:31.010 --> 03:45:31.020 align:start position:0%
have the budget now that they could have
 
03:45:33.469 --> 03:45:33.479 align:start position:0%
tabled it and put it into the budget so
 
03:45:35.690 --> 03:45:35.700 align:start position:0%
I guess I'm I'm trying to understand why
 
03:45:37.849 --> 03:45:37.859 align:start position:0%
we got this bill in the first place
 
03:45:40.210 --> 03:45:40.220 align:start position:0%
so maybe maybe you're a part of the um
 
03:45:42.469 --> 03:45:42.479 align:start position:0%
deliberations of in the other body but
 
03:45:43.490 --> 03:45:43.500 align:start position:0%
I'd like to know a little bit of the
 
03:45:45.469 --> 03:45:45.479 align:start position:0%
background on that I appreciate the
 
03:45:47.450 --> 03:45:47.460 align:start position:0%
question um I'm a
 
03:45:49.910 --> 03:45:49.920 align:start position:0%
I'm a new guy to Concord I'm not part of
 
03:45:53.389 --> 03:45:53.399 align:start position:0%
that process um I wasn't uh around when
 
03:45:56.690 --> 03:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
the bill was drafted and uh I was not
 
03:45:58.910 --> 03:45:58.920 align:start position:0%
part of the process in the senate in
 
03:46:02.330 --> 03:46:02.340 align:start position:0%

not similar but also addresses payment

03:47:53.929 --> 03:47:53.939 align:start position:0%
spend a great deal of time especially in
 
03:47:55.429 --> 03:47:55.439 align:start position:0%
the first half of the session in in the
 
03:47:56.769 --> 03:47:56.779 align:start position:0%
children and family law committee
 
03:47:59.690 --> 03:47:59.700 align:start position:0%
because when we're talking about marital
 
03:48:01.910 --> 03:48:01.920 align:start position:0%
cases we're talking about high conflict
 
03:48:04.250 --> 03:48:04.260 align:start position:0%
cases frequently
 
03:48:08.690 --> 03:48:08.700 align:start position:0%
and within the judicial branch we have a
 
03:48:12.349 --> 03:48:12.359 align:start position:0%
great deal of effort put in in the early
 
03:48:15.910 --> 03:48:15.920 align:start position:0%
stages of of a marital filing
 
03:48:19.250 --> 03:48:19.260 align:start position:0%
to encourage parties into mediation and
 
03:48:21.710 --> 03:48:21.720 align:start position:0%
we very much want parties to reach
 
03:48:24.229 --> 03:48:24.239 align:start position:0%
mediated resolution in these types of
 
03:48:27.769 --> 03:48:27.779 align:start position:0%
cases as opposed to resolutions that are
 
03:48:30.170 --> 03:48:30.180 align:start position:0%
put upon parties in Conflict by a judge
 
03:48:32.870 --> 03:48:32.880 align:start position:0%
they're they're going to get a a result
 
03:48:35.809 --> 03:48:35.819 align:start position:0%
that if they reach agreement on is more
 
03:48:40.550 --> 03:48:40.560 align:start position:0%
likely to be uh longer lasting and more
 
03:48:42.650 --> 03:48:42.660 align:start position:0%
likely to be accepted by the parties
 
03:48:43.910 --> 03:48:43.920 align:start position:0%
they are reaching that agreement
 
03:48:46.849 --> 03:48:46.859 align:start position:0%
themselves so very early on in a marital
 
03:48:48.250 --> 03:48:48.260 align:start position:0%
case we
 
03:48:51.950 --> 03:48:51.960 align:start position:0%
encourage people towards mediation
 
03:48:53.990 --> 03:48:54.000 align:start position:0%
and what this addresses are those in
 
03:48:56.210 --> 03:48:56.220 align:start position:0%
which the both parties when both parties
 
03:48:58.070 --> 03:48:58.080 align:start position:0%
are found to be Indigent so there is a
 
03:49:00.550 --> 03:49:00.560 align:start position:0%
finding in this situation by the court
 
03:49:03.410 --> 03:49:03.420 align:start position:0%
based upon Financial affidavits filed
 
03:49:06.710 --> 03:49:06.720 align:start position:0%
that the parties and again both parties
 
03:49:08.650 --> 03:49:08.660 align:start position:0%
are Indigent
 
03:49:11.530 --> 03:49:11.540 align:start position:0%
the fees for
 
03:49:14.750 --> 03:49:14.760 align:start position:0%
a court-ordered mediation are waived and
 
03:49:16.670 --> 03:49:16.680 align:start position:0%
the court pays for it out of its
 
03:49:19.130 --> 03:49:19.140 align:start position:0%
mediation and arbitration fund the
 
03:49:22.190 --> 03:49:22.200 align:start position:0%
mediation and arbitration fund is itself
 
03:49:25.010 --> 03:49:25.020 align:start position:0%
funded through through Court filing fees
 
03:49:29.630 --> 03:49:29.640 align:start position:0%
is not a general funded fund
 
03:49:32.929 --> 03:49:32.939 align:start position:0%
and and what the parties are entitled to
 
03:49:36.170 --> 03:49:36.180 align:start position:0%
in this process uh if they get a uh
 
03:49:39.530 --> 03:49:39.540 align:start position:0%
court appointed mediator is up to three
 
03:49:41.450 --> 03:49:41.460 align:start position:0%
hours of mediation
 
03:49:43.429 --> 03:49:43.439 align:start position:0%
and under current law the parties are
 
03:49:43.439 --> 03:49:44.510 align:start position:0%
and under current law the parties are
told

03:49:44.510 --> 03:49:44.520 align:start position:0%
told
 
03:49:46.429 --> 03:49:46.439 align:start position:0%
we may come after you for the cost of
 
03:49:49.910 --> 03:49:49.920 align:start position:0%
this after the fact and and we have a
 
03:49:52.010 --> 03:49:52.020 align:start position:0%
significant concern that that drives
 
03:49:54.469 --> 03:49:54.479 align:start position:0%
certain parties towards minimizing the
 
03:49:57.410 --> 03:49:57.420 align:start position:0%
use of the mediator and not making the
 
03:49:59.809 --> 03:49:59.819 align:start position:0%
full use of the three hours if they have
 
03:50:02.630 --> 03:50:02.640 align:start position:0%
a fear whether it's actually going to
 
03:50:04.910 --> 03:50:04.920 align:start position:0%
happen or not is is not known at that
 
03:50:06.410 --> 03:50:06.420 align:start position:0%
point because there's already a finding
 
03:50:07.870 --> 03:50:07.880 align:start position:0%
of indigency
 
03:50:12.290 --> 03:50:12.300 align:start position:0%
but if there is a fear that they're
 
03:50:15.349 --> 03:50:15.359 align:start position:0%
going to have to repay the mediator fees
 
03:50:15.359 --> 03:50:17.389 align:start position:0%
going to have to repay the mediator fees
then

03:50:17.389 --> 03:50:17.399 align:start position:0%
then
 
03:50:17.399 --> 03:50:18.110 align:start position:0%
then
um

03:50:18.110 --> 03:50:18.120 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:50:20.210 --> 03:50:20.220 align:start position:0%
they're less likely to make full use of
 
03:50:22.910 --> 03:50:22.920 align:start position:0%
those of those services and so what our
 
03:50:24.889 --> 03:50:24.899 align:start position:0%
goal is once you're found to be Indigent
 
03:50:26.630 --> 03:50:26.640 align:start position:0%
we're not going to hold over that
 
03:50:29.269 --> 03:50:29.279 align:start position:0%
party's head the possibility of cost
 
03:50:32.769 --> 03:50:32.779 align:start position:0%
recovery of of the mediation fees
 
03:50:36.889 --> 03:50:36.899 align:start position:0%
in order to encourage people to reach
 
03:50:39.290 --> 03:50:39.300 align:start position:0%
agreement and ultimately save Court
 
03:50:43.630 --> 03:50:43.640 align:start position:0%
resources in in having hearings and also
 
03:50:46.370 --> 03:50:46.380 align:start position:0%
provide a better result for the parties
 
03:50:48.889 --> 03:50:48.899 align:start position:0%
who are appearing before the court so
 
03:50:51.889 --> 03:50:51.899 align:start position:0%
the so that's the the essence of of what
 
03:50:54.290 --> 03:50:54.300 align:start position:0%
we're asking in this case
 
03:50:57.229 --> 03:50:57.239 align:start position:0%
and and it really is to get to a better
 
03:51:00.349 --> 03:51:00.359 align:start position:0%
result and fewer Court resources being
 
03:51:04.849 --> 03:51:04.859 align:start position:0%
used at the end of the day for uh for
 
03:51:06.889 --> 03:51:06.899 align:start position:0%
litigation that may have been able to be
 
03:51:08.690 --> 03:51:08.700 align:start position:0%
resolved if the parties were able to
 
03:51:10.750 --> 03:51:10.760 align:start position:0%
spend more time in a mediation setting
 
03:51:13.070 --> 03:51:13.080 align:start position:0%
with that I'll conclude my comments but
 
03:51:14.269 --> 03:51:14.279 align:start position:0%
I'd be happy to answer any questions
 
03:51:16.309 --> 03:51:16.319 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
03:51:16.319 --> 03:51:19.490 align:start position:0%
thank you
questions

03:51:19.490 --> 03:51:19.500 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:19.500 --> 03:51:21.889 align:start position:0%
 
yes

03:51:21.889 --> 03:51:21.899 align:start position:0%
yes
 
03:51:24.590 --> 03:51:24.600 align:start position:0%
you probably can see this coming Mr head
 
03:51:27.229 --> 03:51:27.239 align:start position:0%
and by now you can anticipate all my
 
03:51:27.239 --> 03:51:28.729 align:start position:0%
and by now you can anticipate all my
questions

03:51:28.729 --> 03:51:28.739 align:start position:0%
questions
 
03:51:28.739 --> 03:51:30.469 align:start position:0%
questions
um

03:51:30.469 --> 03:51:30.479 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:30.479 --> 03:51:31.670 align:start position:0%
um
can

03:51:31.670 --> 03:51:31.680 align:start position:0%
can
 
03:51:33.950 --> 03:51:33.960 align:start position:0%
I know this is the policy committee I
 
03:51:35.450 --> 03:51:35.460 align:start position:0%
understand that this is the policy
 
03:51:37.790 --> 03:51:37.800 align:start position:0%
committee it is not the finance
 
03:51:40.309 --> 03:51:40.319 align:start position:0%
committee I know that clearly
 
03:51:44.389 --> 03:51:44.399 align:start position:0%
my question however is because I can't
 
03:51:47.630 --> 03:51:47.640 align:start position:0%
figure it out as I read this
 
03:51:47.640 --> 03:51:49.610 align:start position:0%
figure it out as I read this
um

03:51:49.610 --> 03:51:49.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:51:52.790 --> 03:51:52.800 align:start position:0%
 
03:51:55.490 --> 03:51:55.500 align:start position:0%
can't I can't figure it out looking
 
03:52:01.610 --> 03:52:01.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:01.620 --> 03:52:03.229 align:start position:0%
 
what

03:52:03.229 --> 03:52:03.239 align:start position:0%
what
 
03:52:07.250 --> 03:52:07.260 align:start position:0%
 
03:52:10.309 --> 03:52:10.319 align:start position:0%
that can be anticipated in terms of
 
03:52:14.150 --> 03:52:14.160 align:start position:0%
Financial Risk cost and who will bear
 
03:52:15.410 --> 03:52:15.420 align:start position:0%
that cost
 
03:52:18.769 --> 03:52:18.779 align:start position:0%
based on this legislation which again is
 
03:52:20.990 --> 03:52:21.000 align:start position:0%
scheduled to go into effect 60 days
 
03:52:23.570 --> 03:52:23.580 align:start position:0%
after Passage
 
03:52:25.849 --> 03:52:25.859 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question the
 
03:52:25.859 --> 03:52:27.590 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question the
um

03:52:27.590 --> 03:52:27.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:52:29.150 --> 03:52:29.160 align:start position:0%
there wouldn't be any
 
03:52:30.650 --> 03:52:30.660 align:start position:0%
if I'm understanding your question there
 
03:52:33.170 --> 03:52:33.180 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be any changes to the initial
 
03:52:36.769 --> 03:52:36.779 align:start position:0%
payment so the the payment so there's
 
03:52:39.050 --> 03:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
already a finding of an indigency which
 
03:52:42.950 --> 03:52:42.960 align:start position:0%
entitles the parties to go to mediation
 
03:52:45.530 --> 03:52:45.540 align:start position:0%
and have those mediation fees paid by
 
03:52:49.250 --> 03:52:49.260 align:start position:0%
the the court and and so
 
03:52:51.530 --> 03:52:51.540 align:start position:0%
what we're hoping is that instead of
 
03:52:53.630 --> 03:52:53.640 align:start position:0%
doing it for an hour they'll do it for
 
03:52:56.330 --> 03:52:56.340 align:start position:0%
three hours so there may be additional
 
03:52:59.210 --> 03:52:59.220 align:start position:0%
funds being drawn from our arbitration
 
03:53:02.389 --> 03:53:02.399 align:start position:0%
and mediation fund as a result of the
 
03:53:04.010 --> 03:53:04.020 align:start position:0%
passage of this bill because again we're
 
03:53:05.809 --> 03:53:05.819 align:start position:0%
trying to encourage people to make
 
03:53:07.849 --> 03:53:07.859 align:start position:0%
better use of those mediation services
 
03:53:10.790 --> 03:53:10.800 align:start position:0%
which could translate into instead of an
 
03:53:12.530 --> 03:53:12.540 align:start position:0%
hour's worth of mediation three hours
 
03:53:14.929 --> 03:53:14.939 align:start position:0%
worth of mediations
 
03:53:14.939 --> 03:53:16.130 align:start position:0%
worth of mediations
um

03:53:16.130 --> 03:53:16.140 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:53:18.070 --> 03:53:18.080 align:start position:0%
but in terms of
 
03:53:21.590 --> 03:53:21.600 align:start position:0%
the effective date those funds already
 
03:53:24.290 --> 03:53:24.300 align:start position:0%
exist in our in our account there's
 
03:53:26.809 --> 03:53:26.819 align:start position:0%
money coming in through filing fees in
 
03:53:28.610 --> 03:53:28.620 align:start position:0%
marital cases
 
03:53:30.710 --> 03:53:30.720 align:start position:0%
um so it's not in it and we already
 
03:53:33.349 --> 03:53:33.359 align:start position:0%
process those those payments to the
 
03:53:35.809 --> 03:53:35.819 align:start position:0%
mediators and we have a list of
 
03:53:38.510 --> 03:53:38.520 align:start position:0%
mediators and they're paid a fee or set
 
03:53:43.370 --> 03:53:43.380 align:start position:0%
fee that's that's already established so
 
03:53:45.650 --> 03:53:45.660 align:start position:0%
it wouldn't require a change in process
 
03:53:48.170 --> 03:53:48.180 align:start position:0%
internally and the funding already
 
03:53:50.030 --> 03:53:50.040 align:start position:0%
exists and the mechanism already exists
 
03:53:52.849 --> 03:53:52.859 align:start position:0%
to replenish that fund so I don't think
 
03:53:54.530 --> 03:53:54.540 align:start position:0%
there would be any any substantial
 
03:53:57.229 --> 03:53:57.239 align:start position:0%
changes in in terms of what this does
 
03:54:00.469 --> 03:54:00.479 align:start position:0%
it's really after the fact that you know
 
03:54:02.030 --> 03:54:02.040 align:start position:0%
if if there's a change of financial
 
03:54:04.790 --> 03:54:04.800 align:start position:0%
circumstance we would then say Oh now
 
03:54:06.710 --> 03:54:06.720 align:start position:0%
you got to pay us back for that for that
 
03:54:08.690 --> 03:54:08.700 align:start position:0%
amount that we told you you aren't going
 
03:54:12.050 --> 03:54:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:14.510 --> 03:54:14.520 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative Manos
 
03:54:17.510 --> 03:54:17.520 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you Mr head for
 
03:54:19.190 --> 03:54:19.200 align:start position:0%
taking my question
 
03:54:19.200 --> 03:54:19.849 align:start position:0%
taking my question
um

03:54:19.849 --> 03:54:19.859 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:54:22.130 --> 03:54:22.140 align:start position:0%
I wanted to know about
 
03:54:24.229 --> 03:54:24.239 align:start position:0%
um marital cases where there are no
 
03:54:24.239 --> 03:54:25.910 align:start position:0%
um marital cases where there are no
children

03:54:25.910 --> 03:54:25.920 align:start position:0%
children
 
03:54:27.889 --> 03:54:27.899 align:start position:0%
um and those can obviously be high
 
03:54:30.590 --> 03:54:30.600 align:start position:0%
conflict also and mediation is is
 
03:54:34.130 --> 03:54:34.140 align:start position:0%
invaluable in those cases too and I'm
 
03:54:37.130 --> 03:54:37.140 align:start position:0%
wondering why or whether this was
 
03:54:39.410 --> 03:54:39.420 align:start position:0%
crafted just for
 
03:54:44.809 --> 03:54:44.819 align:start position:0%
 
03:54:46.849 --> 03:54:46.859 align:start position:0%
um so thank you for the question uh I'm
 
03:54:49.790 --> 03:54:49.800 align:start position:0%
trying to remember so yes so
 
03:54:51.710 --> 03:54:51.720 align:start position:0%
we're existing current we're changing
 
03:54:54.290 --> 03:54:54.300 align:start position:0%
current statute if there was a goal and
 
03:54:57.830 --> 03:54:57.840 align:start position:0%
a desire by the legislature to
 
03:55:00.650 --> 03:55:00.660 align:start position:0%
add other types of of cases that would
 
03:55:01.729 --> 03:55:01.739 align:start position:0%
be a different
 
03:55:03.769 --> 03:55:03.779 align:start position:0%
policy question all we're doing is
 
03:55:06.050 --> 03:55:06.060 align:start position:0%
within the existing policy structure
 
03:55:08.090 --> 03:55:08.100 align:start position:0%
that the legislature has set we're
 
03:55:10.729 --> 03:55:10.739 align:start position:0%
modifying it in it in in a place that
 
03:55:13.090 --> 03:55:13.100 align:start position:0%
exists which is 461a
 
03:55:16.550 --> 03:55:16.560 align:start position:0%
and in mediations of cases involving
 
03:55:18.290 --> 03:55:18.300 align:start position:0%
children if there was a policy decision
 
03:55:21.830 --> 03:55:21.840 align:start position:0%
by the legislature to expand that
 
03:55:23.630 --> 03:55:23.640 align:start position:0%
um we would obviously work with with the
 
03:55:24.950 --> 03:55:24.960 align:start position:0%
legislative body we're just changing
 
03:55:27.410 --> 03:55:27.420 align:start position:0%
what we're currently the legislature has
 
03:55:27.420 --> 03:55:30.229 align:start position:0%
what we're currently the legislature has
authorized

03:55:30.229 --> 03:55:30.239 align:start position:0%
 
03:55:32.630 --> 03:55:32.640 align:start position:0%
yes go ahead
 
03:55:35.689 --> 03:55:35.699 align:start position:0%
um but the mediation fund can be used by
 
03:55:38.030 --> 03:55:38.040 align:start position:0%
in marital cases where there aren't
 
03:55:42.050 --> 03:55:42.060 align:start position:0%
children is that correct you know that I
 
03:55:44.210 --> 03:55:44.220 align:start position:0%
didn't ask that specific question before
 
03:55:46.309 --> 03:55:46.319 align:start position:0%
this meeting today so I I would be
 
03:55:48.349 --> 03:55:48.359 align:start position:0%
reluctant to say yes or no without
 
03:55:50.330 --> 03:55:50.340 align:start position:0%
without going back to our mediation
 
03:55:53.330 --> 03:55:53.340 align:start position:0%
folks I apologize
 
03:55:58.189 --> 03:55:58.199 align:start position:0%
 
03:56:01.729 --> 03:56:01.739 align:start position:0%
so am I in effect where if we were to do
 
03:56:05.210 --> 03:56:05.220 align:start position:0%
this and I I mean you're I think on this
 
03:56:07.969 --> 03:56:07.979 align:start position:0%
one I I think you're you know I don't my
 
03:56:09.950 --> 03:56:09.960 align:start position:0%
personal view is you it makes sense what
 
03:56:11.990 --> 03:56:12.000 align:start position:0%
you're suggesting we would be in effect
 
03:56:13.670 --> 03:56:13.680 align:start position:0%
we would be saying
 
03:56:13.680 --> 03:56:14.929 align:start position:0%
we would be saying
that

03:56:14.929 --> 03:56:14.939 align:start position:0%
that
 
03:56:17.150 --> 03:56:17.160 align:start position:0%
for the reasons you've articulated the
 
03:56:17.160 --> 03:56:18.229 align:start position:0%
for the reasons you've articulated the
cost

03:56:18.229 --> 03:56:18.239 align:start position:0%
cost
 
03:56:20.809 --> 03:56:20.819 align:start position:0%
to the the the the mediator in effect
 
03:56:22.790 --> 03:56:22.800 align:start position:0%
would be treated sort of like a Judicial
 
03:56:24.650 --> 03:56:24.660 align:start position:0%
employee I mean I understand that
 
03:56:26.570 --> 03:56:26.580 align:start position:0%
they're going to get paid they're going
 
03:56:28.370 --> 03:56:28.380 align:start position:0%
to get paid from this fund but they're
 
03:56:31.010 --> 03:56:31.020 align:start position:0%
in terms of it's not something that the
 
03:56:32.809 --> 03:56:32.819 align:start position:0%
parties have to bear the responsibility
 
03:56:34.910 --> 03:56:34.920 align:start position:0%
for we would provide this the judicial
 
03:56:37.250 --> 03:56:37.260 align:start position:0%
branch would provide this sort of as a
 
03:56:39.050 --> 03:56:39.060 align:start position:0%
service just like they provide the judge
 
03:56:41.570 --> 03:56:41.580 align:start position:0%
for the trial if the uh if the parties
 
03:56:43.429 --> 03:56:43.439 align:start position:0%
go to trial that's exactly we picked the
 
03:56:45.530 --> 03:56:45.540 align:start position:0%
mediator uh we have a list of mediators
 
03:56:47.450 --> 03:56:47.460 align:start position:0%
they get they would get paid by the
 
03:56:49.610 --> 03:56:49.620 align:start position:0%
court system and the only thing the
 
03:56:52.670 --> 03:56:52.680 align:start position:0%
parties have to do is coordinate the the
 
03:56:55.610 --> 03:56:55.620 align:start position:0%
time and and uh involvement of the
 
03:56:57.889 --> 03:56:57.899 align:start position:0%
mediator but their only involvement as
 
03:57:00.650 --> 03:57:00.660 align:start position:0%
parties is to actually mediate and not
 
03:57:02.990 --> 03:57:03.000 align:start position:0%
manage any any other aspect of it they
 
03:57:06.469 --> 03:57:06.479 align:start position:0%
would just appear uh and participate in
 
03:57:08.450 --> 03:57:08.460 align:start position:0%
the mediation as coordinated with the
 
03:57:08.460 --> 03:57:10.189 align:start position:0%
the mediation as coordinated with the
mediator

03:57:10.189 --> 03:57:10.199 align:start position:0%
mediator
 
03:57:12.410 --> 03:57:12.420 align:start position:0%
thank you other any other questions for
 
03:57:16.189 --> 03:57:16.199 align:start position:0%
this witness thank you very much Mr Ed
 
03:57:18.650 --> 03:57:18.660 align:start position:0%
yeah oh I'm sorry I didn't see you it's
 
03:57:20.630 --> 03:57:20.640 align:start position:0%
all good thank you Mr chair
 
03:57:22.790 --> 03:57:22.800 align:start position:0%
um this is a question I also had on the
 
03:57:25.309 --> 03:57:25.319 align:start position:0%
last bill of why this bill was sent to
 
03:57:28.189 --> 03:57:28.199 align:start position:0%
us with the fiscal impact
 
03:57:29.809 --> 03:57:29.819 align:start position:0%
that's going to affect fiscal year 24
 
03:57:31.849 --> 03:57:31.859 align:start position:0%
and 25
 
03:57:31.859 --> 03:57:32.389 align:start position:0%
and 25
.

03:57:32.389 --> 03:57:32.399 align:start position:0%
.
 
03:57:34.969 --> 03:57:34.979 align:start position:0%
um can you shed some light on why it
 
03:57:34.979 --> 03:57:36.170 align:start position:0%
um can you shed some light on why it
wasn't

03:57:36.170 --> 03:57:36.180 align:start position:0%
wasn't
 
03:57:38.510 --> 03:57:38.520 align:start position:0%
tabled in the other body and perhaps put
 
03:57:40.550 --> 03:57:40.560 align:start position:0%
into the budget so thank you for the
 
03:57:40.560 --> 03:57:41.630 align:start position:0%
into the budget so thank you for the
question

03:57:41.630 --> 03:57:41.640 align:start position:0%
question
 
03:57:45.349 --> 03:57:45.359 align:start position:0%
um uh I will not uh pretend I can I
 
03:57:47.689 --> 03:57:47.699 align:start position:0%
fully understand the Senate processes
 
03:57:50.630 --> 03:57:50.640 align:start position:0%
um but I think in this case at least
 
03:57:50.640 --> 03:57:51.610 align:start position:0%
um but I think in this case at least
um

03:57:51.610 --> 03:57:51.620 align:start position:0%
um
 
03:57:54.950 --> 03:57:54.960 align:start position:0%
the since there is no general fund money
 
03:57:58.070 --> 03:57:58.080 align:start position:0%
involved it wouldn't change the budget
 
03:58:00.650 --> 03:58:00.660 align:start position:0%
Appropriations it's more of a of a
 
03:58:02.269 --> 03:58:02.279 align:start position:0%
straight policy even though there is a
 
03:58:04.309 --> 03:58:04.319 align:start position:0%
fiscal impact it's on an existing fund
 
03:58:06.590 --> 03:58:06.600 align:start position:0%
that's funded through court fees it
 
03:58:08.750 --> 03:58:08.760 align:start position:0%
probably is different than those cases
 
03:58:11.870 --> 03:58:11.880 align:start position:0%
those bills I'm sorry that they retain
 
03:58:14.389 --> 03:58:14.399 align:start position:0%
as you said which is routine for them to
 
03:58:16.490 --> 03:58:16.500 align:start position:0%
retain and then incorporate into into
 
03:58:18.769 --> 03:58:18.779 align:start position:0%
the budget and the trailer bill in this
 
03:58:20.330 --> 03:58:20.340 align:start position:0%
case it makes sense in the other bill I
 
03:58:22.790 --> 03:58:22.800 align:start position:0%
honestly don't know
 
03:58:25.130 --> 03:58:25.140 align:start position:0%
of any other questions
 
03:58:26.990 --> 03:58:27.000 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much Mr head
 
03:58:40.610 --> 03:58:40.620 align:start position:0%
 
03:58:42.349 --> 03:58:42.359 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
03:58:44.750 --> 03:58:44.760 align:start position:0%
hearing on Senate Bill 129 and take
 
03:58:47.630 --> 03:58:47.640 align:start position:0%
about a three-minute break until two
 
03:58:49.610 --> 03:58:49.620 align:start position:0%
o'clock when we can take up the next
 
03:58:49.620 --> 04:02:27.229 align:start position:0%
o'clock when we can take up the next
bill

04:02:27.229 --> 04:02:27.239 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:29.150 --> 04:02:29.160 align:start position:0%
oh it's two o'clock
 
04:02:31.189 --> 04:02:31.199 align:start position:0%
um and I'm going to uh open the hearing
 
04:02:33.349 --> 04:02:33.359 align:start position:0%
on SB 183
 
04:02:37.189 --> 04:02:37.199 align:start position:0%
and I will first call on uh daily frenet
 
04:02:39.650 --> 04:02:39.660 align:start position:0%
am I pronouncing that correctly
 
04:02:44.510 --> 04:02:44.520 align:start position:0%
 
04:02:46.309 --> 04:02:46.319 align:start position:0%
good afternoon chairman Lynn and members
 
04:02:47.750 --> 04:02:47.760 align:start position:0%
of the committee my name is Daley
 
04:02:49.010 --> 04:02:49.020 align:start position:0%
frenette and I am the Senate majority
 
04:02:51.170 --> 04:02:51.180 align:start position:0%
caucus director I'm here to introduce
 
04:02:52.849 --> 04:02:52.859 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 183 on behalf of senator
 
04:02:55.010 --> 04:02:55.020 align:start position:0%
ricciardi this bill adds another
 
04:02:56.870 --> 04:02:56.880 align:start position:0%
exemption to the list of exemptions in
 
04:03:01.429 --> 04:03:01.439 align:start position:0%
RSA 106-h colon 14. currently a 9-1-1
 
04:03:03.290 --> 04:03:03.300 align:start position:0%
caller is unable to obtain a transcript
 
04:03:05.389 --> 04:03:05.399 align:start position:0%
of their 9-1-1 call without a subpoena
 
04:03:07.189 --> 04:03:07.199 align:start position:0%
which which means without a pending
 
04:03:09.349 --> 04:03:09.359 align:start position:0%
lawsuit there are many instances when
 
04:03:11.450 --> 04:03:11.460 align:start position:0%
this information is needed pre-sued for
 
04:03:13.370 --> 04:03:13.380 align:start position:0%
investigative purposes or for use in
 
04:03:15.769 --> 04:03:15.779 align:start position:0%
pre-suit negotiations up of as upwards
 
04:03:18.950 --> 04:03:18.960 align:start position:0%
of 90 of civil cases settle pre-suit
 
04:03:22.610 --> 04:03:22.620 align:start position:0%
in the 2022 case BNC MGMT versus New
 
04:03:24.050 --> 04:03:24.060 align:start position:0%
Hampshire division of Emergency Services
 
04:03:26.030 --> 04:03:26.040 align:start position:0%
the New Hampshire Supreme Court was
 
04:03:28.189 --> 04:03:28.199 align:start position:0%
forced to deny a request for a 9-1-1
 
04:03:30.710 --> 04:03:30.720 align:start position:0%
recording regarding an injury to a guest
 
04:03:33.769 --> 04:03:33.779 align:start position:0%
on the premises because RSA 106-age
 
04:03:35.929 --> 04:03:35.939 align:start position:0%
colon 14 does not provide an exception
 
04:03:38.750 --> 04:03:38.760 align:start position:0%
for disclosure under these circumstances
 
04:03:40.610 --> 04:03:40.620 align:start position:0%
the court invited legislative actions
 
04:03:42.050 --> 04:03:42.060 align:start position:0%
stating and its ruling if the
 
04:03:43.490 --> 04:03:43.500 align:start position:0%
legislature disagrees with our
 
04:03:46.250 --> 04:03:46.260 align:start position:0%
interpretation is it
 
04:03:48.290 --> 04:03:48.300 align:start position:0%
it is free to amend the statutory scheme
 
04:03:49.969 --> 04:03:49.979 align:start position:0%
as it sees fit within constitutional
 
04:03:52.309 --> 04:03:52.319 align:start position:0%
bounds as a state that values its
 
04:03:53.990 --> 04:03:54.000 align:start position:0%
privacy Provisions we are mindful that
 
04:03:54.000 --> 04:03:55.330 align:start position:0%
privacy Provisions we are mindful that
911

04:03:55.330 --> 04:03:55.340 align:start position:0%
911
 
04:03:57.769 --> 04:03:57.779 align:start position:0%
can contain sensitive information and
 
04:03:59.929 --> 04:03:59.939 align:start position:0%
therefore this proposed Bill requires an
 
04:04:02.150 --> 04:04:02.160 align:start position:0%
authorization signed by the caller which
 
04:04:03.710 --> 04:04:03.720 align:start position:0%
addresses privacy and disclosure
 
04:04:05.809 --> 04:04:05.819 align:start position:0%
concerns please note that this bill
 
04:04:07.910 --> 04:04:07.920 align:start position:0%
would only allow the caller who made the
 
04:04:10.610 --> 04:04:10.620 align:start position:0%
911 call after assigning after signing
 
04:04:12.290 --> 04:04:12.300 align:start position:0%
an authorized release to access their
 
04:04:14.210 --> 04:04:14.220 align:start position:0%
own call only
 
04:04:16.309 --> 04:04:16.319 align:start position:0%
this bill is crafted carefully to take
 
04:04:18.290 --> 04:04:18.300 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns into account as well as
 
04:04:19.670 --> 04:04:19.680 align:start position:0%
the concerns of law enforcement about
 
04:04:21.530 --> 04:04:21.540 align:start position:0%
ongoing investigations
 
04:04:22.910 --> 04:04:22.920 align:start position:0%
thank you a lot for allowing me the
 
04:04:24.469 --> 04:04:24.479 align:start position:0%
opportunity to speak today I will defer
 
04:04:25.729 --> 04:04:25.739 align:start position:0%
any questions you may have to the others
 
04:04:26.809 --> 04:04:26.819 align:start position:0%
behind me
 
04:04:30.710 --> 04:04:30.720 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:32.510 --> 04:04:32.520 align:start position:0%
all right questions yes representative
 
04:04:32.520 --> 04:04:35.769 align:start position:0%
all right questions yes representative
Perez

04:04:35.769 --> 04:04:35.779 align:start position:0%
 
04:04:38.689 --> 04:04:38.699 align:start position:0%
why only for purpose of legal
 
04:04:41.389 --> 04:04:41.399 align:start position:0%
investigation or proceedings let me
 
04:04:44.389 --> 04:04:44.399 align:start position:0%
explain why I asked that we just had we
 
04:04:46.849 --> 04:04:46.859 align:start position:0%
had an episode uh last summer where I
 
04:04:49.910 --> 04:04:49.920 align:start position:0%
live where a um
 
04:04:54.170 --> 04:04:54.180 align:start position:0%
a woman made a call to 9-1-1 because she
 
04:04:55.969 --> 04:04:55.979 align:start position:0%
was concerned about a car that almost
 
04:04:59.389 --> 04:04:59.399 align:start position:0%
hit her children and when it was she
 
04:05:02.330 --> 04:05:02.340 align:start position:0%
brought it up at a council meeting the
 
04:05:04.130 --> 04:05:04.140 align:start position:0%
chief of police said well we never got
 
04:05:05.349 --> 04:05:05.359 align:start position:0%
that call
 
04:05:10.250 --> 04:05:10.260 align:start position:0%
they had to use a 991 a in order to get
 
04:05:12.309 --> 04:05:12.319 align:start position:0%
that information
 
04:05:14.750 --> 04:05:14.760 align:start position:0%
I believe it was political because it
 
04:05:17.750 --> 04:05:17.760 align:start position:0%
involved some political people so why
 
04:05:20.090 --> 04:05:20.100 align:start position:0%
does it only have to be for legal
 
04:05:22.670 --> 04:05:22.680 align:start position:0%
investigations or proceedings
 
04:05:23.809 --> 04:05:23.819 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
 
04:05:23.819 --> 04:05:25.130 align:start position:0%
well thank you for the question
representative

04:05:25.130 --> 04:05:25.140 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:05:27.349 --> 04:05:27.359 align:start position:0%
um I would defer that question to the
 
04:05:28.849 --> 04:05:28.859 align:start position:0%
department I believe they're here they
 
04:05:30.889 --> 04:05:30.899 align:start position:0%
can fully answer your question
 
04:05:32.210 --> 04:05:32.220 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:35.630 --> 04:05:35.640 align:start position:0%
other question yes representative Oregon
 
04:05:37.550 --> 04:05:37.560 align:start position:0%
first question is well it's kind of a
 
04:05:39.469 --> 04:05:39.479 align:start position:0%
dumb one but how do you prove
 
04:05:42.410 --> 04:05:42.420 align:start position:0%
who the caller was since anybody
 
04:05:45.410 --> 04:05:45.420 align:start position:0%
can make a call on 9911 calls can be
 
04:05:47.330 --> 04:05:47.340 align:start position:0%
anonymous so how do you prove who the
 
04:05:49.550 --> 04:05:49.560 align:start position:0%
caller was
 
04:05:51.889 --> 04:05:51.899 align:start position:0%
uh thank you representative I will again
 
04:05:53.630 --> 04:05:53.640 align:start position:0%
defer your question to the department
 
04:05:55.490 --> 04:05:55.500 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:05:58.010 --> 04:05:58.020 align:start position:0%
and representative Manos thank you Mr
 
04:05:58.020 --> 04:05:59.150 align:start position:0%
and representative Manos thank you Mr

chair
 
04:06:01.130 --> 04:06:01.140 align:start position:0%
um Mr chairman point of order I think he
 
04:06:03.170 --> 04:06:03.180 align:start position:0%
wants to defer all questions I think he
 
04:06:05.570 --> 04:06:05.580 align:start position:0%
said that at the end of his testimony
 
04:06:07.969 --> 04:06:07.979 align:start position:0%
I did oh thank you all right nope that's

Ross
 
04:06:53.929 --> 04:06:53.939 align:start position:0%
um and I am a partner at the law firm of
 
04:06:55.849 --> 04:06:55.859 align:start position:0%
Russo and Ross in Lebanon New Hampshire
 
04:06:58.189 --> 04:06:58.199 align:start position:0%
I was also born and raised and live in
 
04:06:59.929 --> 04:06:59.939 align:start position:0%
Grafton County I live in Piermont New
 
04:07:02.570 --> 04:07:02.580 align:start position:0%
Hampshire I am testifying uh this
 
04:07:05.929 --> 04:07:05.939 align:start position:0%
afternoon in support of Senate Bill 183
 
04:07:07.429 --> 04:07:07.439 align:start position:0%
and on behalf of the New Hampshire
 
04:07:09.950 --> 04:07:09.960 align:start position:0%
Association for justice
 
04:07:13.670 --> 04:07:13.680 align:start position:0%
our current law right now in New
 
04:07:16.490 --> 04:07:16.500 align:start position:0%
Hampshire is clear that 9-1-1 recordings
 
04:07:19.969 --> 04:07:19.979 align:start position:0%
are not public records subject to right
 
04:07:23.630 --> 04:07:23.640 align:start position:0%
to no requests that means without a
 
04:07:27.229 --> 04:07:27.239 align:start position:0%
subpoena or litigation there is no way
 
04:07:30.229 --> 04:07:30.239 align:start position:0%
to obtain a 9-1-1 call
 
04:07:32.450 --> 04:07:32.460 align:start position:0%
um even if it contains important
 
04:07:34.910 --> 04:07:34.920 align:start position:0%
information that's relevant to a case
 
04:07:37.729 --> 04:07:37.739 align:start position:0%
I currently represent an elderly couple
 
04:07:40.010 --> 04:07:40.020 align:start position:0%
who are involved in a very serious motor
 
04:07:43.010 --> 04:07:43.020 align:start position:0%
vehicle collision the uh gentleman broke
 
04:07:45.170 --> 04:07:45.180 align:start position:0%
his back and is sternum and was having
 
04:07:47.210 --> 04:07:47.220 align:start position:0%
difficulty breathing at the scene his
 
04:07:50.030 --> 04:07:50.040 align:start position:0%
elderly wife called 9-1-1 and was
 
04:07:52.729 --> 04:07:52.739 align:start position:0%
fearful that her husband was dying
 
04:07:56.330 --> 04:07:56.340 align:start position:0%
she has an emotional distress claim but
 
04:07:59.150 --> 04:07:59.160 align:start position:0%
I can't get access to her 9-1-1 call
 
04:08:01.670 --> 04:08:01.680 align:start position:0%
unless I file a lawsuit which they don't
 
04:08:03.769 --> 04:08:03.779 align:start position:0%
want me to do I'm trying to work with
 
04:08:05.510 --> 04:08:05.520 align:start position:0%
the insurance company to resolve the
 
04:08:08.750 --> 04:08:08.760 align:start position:0%
claim but I have no way to obtain that
 
04:08:11.570 --> 04:08:11.580 align:start position:0%
evidence right now under our current law
 
04:08:15.790 --> 04:08:15.800 align:start position:0%
so there are only two exceptions to have
 
04:08:19.969 --> 04:08:19.979 align:start position:0%
for when a 9-1-1 call can be released
 
04:08:22.370 --> 04:08:22.380 align:start position:0%
without a subpoena or a court order
 
04:08:28.070 --> 04:08:28.080 align:start position:0%
those are found in RSA 106 h14 they
 
04:08:30.410 --> 04:08:30.420 align:start position:0%
allow law enforcement to obtain the
 
04:08:33.229 --> 04:08:33.239 align:start position:0%
records or they allow the Department of
 
04:08:35.809 --> 04:08:35.819 align:start position:0%
Environmental Services so the New
 
04:08:38.389 --> 04:08:38.399 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association for justice worked
 
04:08:40.250 --> 04:08:40.260 align:start position:0%
with Mark Doyle from the New Hampshire
 
04:08:43.070 --> 04:08:43.080 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety and thankfully we
 
04:08:45.650 --> 04:08:45.660 align:start position:0%
were able to work collaboratively on
 
04:08:48.769 --> 04:08:48.779 align:start position:0%
this legislation to come up with an
 
04:08:50.990 --> 04:08:51.000 align:start position:0%
amendment that addresses both the
 
04:08:53.269 --> 04:08:53.279 align:start position:0%
concerns of folks like attorney suford
 
04:08:55.250 --> 04:08:55.260 align:start position:0%
and I who represent injured victims in
 
04:08:57.410 --> 04:08:57.420 align:start position:0%
New Hampshire as well as law enforcement
 
04:08:59.570 --> 04:08:59.580 align:start position:0%
in the department of safety and so
 
04:09:01.969 --> 04:09:01.979 align:start position:0%
what's really important is that this
 
04:09:04.550 --> 04:09:04.560 align:start position:0%
amendment does not change the nature of
 
04:09:08.150 --> 04:09:08.160 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 calls meaning they will not be
 
04:09:11.750 --> 04:09:11.760 align:start position:0%
subject to right to know in 91a requests
 
04:09:14.990 --> 04:09:15.000 align:start position:0%
with this amendment instead it's just
 
04:09:20.389 --> 04:09:20.399 align:start position:0%
adding a third exception to 106 H so
 
04:09:23.210 --> 04:09:23.220 align:start position:0%
that we can obtain them in a civil case
 
04:09:25.490 --> 04:09:25.500 align:start position:0%
for the purposes of Investigation or
 
04:09:27.229 --> 04:09:27.239 align:start position:0%
bringing a civil case
 
04:09:29.689 --> 04:09:29.699 align:start position:0%
it it requires that the caller
 
04:09:31.910 --> 04:09:31.920 align:start position:0%
themselves release the records similar
 
04:09:33.889 --> 04:09:33.899 align:start position:0%
to what we use like a HIPAA release when
 
04:09:35.689 --> 04:09:35.699 align:start position:0%
we use that to request medical records
 
04:09:37.729 --> 04:09:37.739 align:start position:0%
something along those lines which we've
 
04:09:39.590 --> 04:09:39.600 align:start position:0%
already talked to Mr Doyle about and
 
04:09:40.910 --> 04:09:40.920 align:start position:0%
he's going to be working on a form
 
04:09:42.710 --> 04:09:42.720 align:start position:0%
that's acceptable to the Department of
 
04:09:46.250 --> 04:09:46.260 align:start position:0%
Safety so that avoids privacy concerns
 
04:09:47.870 --> 04:09:47.880 align:start position:0%
because the person who made the call
 
04:09:51.110 --> 04:09:51.120 align:start position:0%
will be releasing that call
 
04:09:55.729 --> 04:09:55.739 align:start position:0%
the bill one of the Mr Doyle's concerns
 
04:09:58.130 --> 04:09:58.140 align:start position:0%
from the Department of Safety is the
 
04:10:00.590 --> 04:10:00.600 align:start position:0%
idea that if they release 9-1-1 calls
 
04:10:02.929 --> 04:10:02.939 align:start position:0%
and then they're put out on social media
 
04:10:05.630 --> 04:10:05.640 align:start position:0%
or put out in a way that the department
 
04:10:07.969 --> 04:10:07.979 align:start position:0%
never intended for them to be released
 
04:10:10.429 --> 04:10:10.439 align:start position:0%
and so we've made it clear in the
 
04:10:13.790 --> 04:10:13.800 align:start position:0%
amendment that the 9-1-1 transcript can
 
04:10:16.490 --> 04:10:16.500 align:start position:0%
only be used for the purposes of the
 
04:10:19.670 --> 04:10:19.680 align:start position:0%
pending civil claim
 
04:10:22.849 --> 04:10:22.859 align:start position:0%
um we also looked at other limited
 
04:10:24.830 --> 04:10:24.840 align:start position:0%
release exceptions under our statutes
 
04:10:27.290 --> 04:10:27.300 align:start position:0%
and we added language saying that there
 
04:10:29.210 --> 04:10:29.220 align:start position:0%
these calls are only released for The
 
04:10:30.830 --> 04:10:30.840 align:start position:0%
Limited purpose and will not be
 
04:10:32.750 --> 04:10:32.760 align:start position:0%
redisclosed these were concerns of the
 
04:10:34.670 --> 04:10:34.680 align:start position:0%
Department of Safety
 
04:10:36.769 --> 04:10:36.779 align:start position:0%
um in summary I ask you to support
 
04:10:40.130 --> 04:10:40.140 align:start position:0%
Senate Bill 183 because the bill is
 
04:10:42.229 --> 04:10:42.239 align:start position:0%
narrowly tailored to fix a problem
 
04:10:44.689 --> 04:10:44.699 align:start position:0%
that's negatively affecting injured New
 
04:10:47.150 --> 04:10:47.160 align:start position:0%
Hampshire citizens by allowing them to
 
04:10:49.309 --> 04:10:49.319 align:start position:0%
obtain evidence that they need to
 
04:10:51.050 --> 04:10:51.060 align:start position:0%
resolve their insurance claims without
 
04:10:53.830 --> 04:10:53.840 align:start position:0%
litigation and the bill represent
 
04:10:56.510 --> 04:10:56.520 align:start position:0%
represents a compromise among the
 
04:10:58.130 --> 04:10:58.140 align:start position:0%
stakeholders because it addresses
 
04:11:00.729 --> 04:11:00.739 align:start position:0%
privacy concerns requires a release
 
04:11:03.530 --> 04:11:03.540 align:start position:0%
ensures that the records won't mess up
 
04:11:05.210 --> 04:11:05.220 align:start position:0%
any criminal proceedings you have to
 
04:11:07.610 --> 04:11:07.620 align:start position:0%
wait until any criminal case is done so
 
04:11:10.070 --> 04:11:10.080 align:start position:0%
you don't have evidence released from a
 
04:11:12.050 --> 04:11:12.060 align:start position:0%
you know that could hurt an ongoing
 
04:11:14.510 --> 04:11:14.520 align:start position:0%
criminal case and it limits the use of
 
04:11:16.910 --> 04:11:16.920 align:start position:0%
the call so those were the issues that
 
04:11:18.469 --> 04:11:18.479 align:start position:0%
we collaborated with the Department of
 
04:11:21.290 --> 04:11:21.300 align:start position:0%
Safety on so those were my remarks I
 
04:11:22.429 --> 04:11:22.439 align:start position:0%
know there were a couple questions
 
04:11:25.429 --> 04:11:25.439 align:start position:0%
chairman Lynn do you want me to speak to
 
04:11:27.469 --> 04:11:27.479 align:start position:0%
those or do would you like me to wait
 
04:11:29.750 --> 04:11:29.760 align:start position:0%
well no if you're if you if you have
 
04:11:31.250 --> 04:11:31.260 align:start position:0%
other things you want to say go ahead I
 
04:11:33.050 --> 04:11:33.060 align:start position:0%
will I'm sure that some of us will have
 
04:11:36.050 --> 04:11:36.060 align:start position:0%
questions sure one of the questions
 
04:11:38.630 --> 04:11:38.640 align:start position:0%
um was why only legal proceedings
 
04:11:41.809 --> 04:11:41.819 align:start position:0%
this is a I mean sure ideally right and
 
04:11:43.809 --> 04:11:43.819 align:start position:0%
I guess you could come up with a
 
04:11:46.130 --> 04:11:46.140 align:start position:0%
amendment that would allow anybody to
 
04:11:47.990 --> 04:11:48.000 align:start position:0%
get them for any reason
 
04:11:49.250 --> 04:11:49.260 align:start position:0%
um I can tell you the department of
 
04:11:50.929 --> 04:11:50.939 align:start position:0%
safety won't be super thrilled about
 
04:11:53.570 --> 04:11:53.580 align:start position:0%
that they were really just practically
 
04:11:56.030 --> 04:11:56.040 align:start position:0%
worried about how many requests are we
 
04:11:57.710 --> 04:11:57.720 align:start position:0%
gonna get how are we going to be dealing
 
04:11:59.030 --> 04:11:59.040 align:start position:0%
with this how do we make sure that
 
04:12:00.950 --> 04:12:00.960 align:start position:0%
they're only getting released in the
 
04:12:03.469 --> 04:12:03.479 align:start position:0%
appropriate circumstances that's why we
 
04:12:04.729 --> 04:12:04.739 align:start position:0%
worked really hard with the Department
 
04:12:08.090 --> 04:12:08.100 align:start position:0%
of Safety to come up with an exception
 
04:12:09.889 --> 04:12:09.899 align:start position:0%
um and and we're really looking at where
 
04:12:11.570 --> 04:12:11.580 align:start position:0%
there's a real need
 
04:12:15.349 --> 04:12:15.359 align:start position:0%
and right now primarily you need them in
 
04:12:17.750 --> 04:12:17.760 align:start position:0%
either criminal or civil cases those are
 
04:12:19.849 --> 04:12:19.859 align:start position:0%
the two main areas where you really have
 
04:12:22.130 --> 04:12:22.140 align:start position:0%
a need for this evidence and the statute
 
04:12:24.530 --> 04:12:24.540 align:start position:0%
already allows it um in criminal cases
 
04:12:26.750 --> 04:12:26.760 align:start position:0%
we were just missing the other piece
 
04:12:28.790 --> 04:12:28.800 align:start position:0%
about a civil case so
 
04:12:31.250 --> 04:12:31.260 align:start position:0%
um you know in the example you gave
 
04:12:32.809 --> 04:12:32.819 align:start position:0%
about somebody who was concerned about
 
04:12:34.429 --> 04:12:34.439 align:start position:0%
safety or there was an issue with their
 
04:12:37.070 --> 04:12:37.080 align:start position:0%
vehicle that actually if there was a
 
04:12:38.570 --> 04:12:38.580 align:start position:0%
potential civil claim that they were
 
04:12:40.010 --> 04:12:40.020 align:start position:0%
investigating and they were working with
 
04:12:41.510 --> 04:12:41.520 align:start position:0%
an attorney that would be an appropriate
 
04:12:44.030 --> 04:12:44.040 align:start position:0%
reason and they would be able to get a
 
04:12:45.590 --> 04:12:45.600 align:start position:0%
copy of their 9-1-1 call under this
 
04:12:45.600 --> 04:12:47.750 align:start position:0%
copy of their 9-1-1 call under this
amendment

04:12:47.750 --> 04:12:47.760 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:12:50.030 --> 04:12:50.040 align:start position:0%
and then how do we prove who the caller
 
04:12:52.490 --> 04:12:52.500 align:start position:0%
was that's an interesting question I
 
04:12:55.250 --> 04:12:55.260 align:start position:0%
know in all of the cases that we're
 
04:12:57.530 --> 04:12:57.540 align:start position:0%
envisioning we're representing the
 
04:12:59.330 --> 04:12:59.340 align:start position:0%
caller or the caller as the family
 
04:13:01.250 --> 04:13:01.260 align:start position:0%
member who is in the vehicle with our
 
04:13:03.349 --> 04:13:03.359 align:start position:0%
with our client so we know who the
 
04:13:05.809 --> 04:13:05.819 align:start position:0%
caller is but generally the 911
 
04:13:07.610 --> 04:13:07.620 align:start position:0%
recordings you can identify the phone
 
04:13:09.769 --> 04:13:09.779 align:start position:0%
number that they called in on and that
 
04:13:12.170 --> 04:13:12.180 align:start position:0%
could you know I'm sure if there was an
 
04:13:14.150 --> 04:13:14.160 align:start position:0%
issue you know the department of safety
 
04:13:15.650 --> 04:13:15.660 align:start position:0%
could work to make sure it was the
 
04:13:18.650 --> 04:13:18.660 align:start position:0%
appropriate caller um I I didn't
 
04:13:20.389 --> 04:13:20.399 align:start position:0%
get a sense from the Department of
 
04:13:22.010 --> 04:13:22.020 align:start position:0%
Safety that that was a real practical
 
04:13:24.469 --> 04:13:24.479 align:start position:0%
concern of theirs
 
04:13:27.710 --> 04:13:27.720 align:start position:0%
so usually if usually not that they ever
 
04:13:29.809 --> 04:13:29.819 align:start position:0%
follow it
 
04:13:33.110 --> 04:13:33.120 align:start position:0%
oh are you a follow-up yes go ahead
 
04:13:34.790 --> 04:13:34.800 align:start position:0%
follow-up sorry
 
04:13:37.969 --> 04:13:37.979 align:start position:0%
um isn't it also true that uh if the 911
 
04:13:39.830 --> 04:13:39.840 align:start position:0%
call center represent follows the script
 
04:13:41.809 --> 04:13:41.819 align:start position:0%
and of course it never goes according to
 
04:13:43.790 --> 04:13:43.800 align:start position:0%
script they're supposed to find out what
 
04:13:45.889 --> 04:13:45.899 align:start position:0%
the name of the caller was and
 
04:13:47.990 --> 04:13:48.000 align:start position:0%
get some other information like where
 
04:13:49.429 --> 04:13:49.439 align:start position:0%
this is happening and so forth right
 
04:13:51.710 --> 04:13:51.720 align:start position:0%
that too so correct
 
04:13:53.450 --> 04:13:53.460 align:start position:0%
other questions yes representative
 
04:13:55.309 --> 04:13:55.319 align:start position:0%
cutoff and then representative Perez
 
04:13:55.319 --> 04:13:56.689 align:start position:0%
cutoff and then representative Perez
next

04:13:56.689 --> 04:13:56.699 align:start position:0%
next
 
04:13:59.929 --> 04:13:59.939 align:start position:0%
just a question so what if somebody else
 
04:14:01.910 --> 04:14:01.920 align:start position:0%
witnessed an accident and called into
 
04:14:05.450 --> 04:14:05.460 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 the way that this is written it
 
04:14:08.210 --> 04:14:08.220 align:start position:0%
would be prohibiting you from getting
 
04:14:10.370 --> 04:14:10.380 align:start position:0%
the call unless you had written
 
04:14:11.570 --> 04:14:11.580 align:start position:0%
authorization what if you didn't even
 
04:14:13.370 --> 04:14:13.380 align:start position:0%
know who that person was but you knew
 
04:14:15.530 --> 04:14:15.540 align:start position:0%
and it was relevant to your client you
 
04:14:17.150 --> 04:14:17.160 align:start position:0%
knew that somebody else had witnessed
 
04:14:19.689 --> 04:14:19.699 align:start position:0%
the accident and had called 9-1-1
 
04:14:22.130 --> 04:14:22.140 align:start position:0%
this wouldn't allow that would you like
 
04:14:24.410 --> 04:14:24.420 align:start position:0%
it to be amended so that that would also
 
04:14:26.090 --> 04:14:26.100 align:start position:0%
be available because it would be
 
04:14:28.070 --> 04:14:28.080 align:start position:0%
directly I guess relevant but you still
 
04:14:30.769 --> 04:14:30.779 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be able to get it
 
04:14:32.150 --> 04:14:32.160 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:14:35.630 --> 04:14:35.640 align:start position:0%
that's a great point and when we the New
 
04:14:37.550 --> 04:14:37.560 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association for justice
 
04:14:39.469 --> 04:14:39.479 align:start position:0%
recognized that we had a problem here
 
04:14:42.110 --> 04:14:42.120 align:start position:0%
with the law and tried to brainstorm a
 
04:14:44.689 --> 04:14:44.699 align:start position:0%
good fix right
 
04:14:47.210 --> 04:14:47.220 align:start position:0%
um we were we knew it was important to
 
04:14:48.769 --> 04:14:48.779 align:start position:0%
work with the Department of Safety and
 
04:14:51.769 --> 04:14:51.779 align:start position:0%
law enforcement and to work with them on
 
04:14:55.010 --> 04:14:55.020 align:start position:0%
some of their concerns and so one of
 
04:14:59.389 --> 04:14:59.399 align:start position:0%
their big concerns is these 9-1-1 calls
 
04:15:02.510 --> 04:15:02.520 align:start position:0%
getting disseminated shared on social
 
04:15:04.670 --> 04:15:04.680 align:start position:0%
media things that are in them that are
 
04:15:06.469 --> 04:15:06.479 align:start position:0%
sensitive to
 
04:15:09.290 --> 04:15:09.300 align:start position:0%
family law matters or anything else they
 
04:15:11.090 --> 04:15:11.100 align:start position:0%
didn't want all of a sudden all this
 
04:15:13.250 --> 04:15:13.260 align:start position:0%
information into the public sphere and
 
04:15:15.830 --> 04:15:15.840 align:start position:0%
so a way that we thought about a
 
04:15:19.550 --> 04:15:19.560 align:start position:0%
reasonable compromise was what we put in
 
04:15:22.429 --> 04:15:22.439 align:start position:0%
the Lang in in the amendment so there
 
04:15:25.790 --> 04:15:25.800 align:start position:0%
are I would say safety parameters built
 
04:15:29.450 --> 04:15:29.460 align:start position:0%
into the disclosure for the purposes of
 
04:15:31.429 --> 04:15:31.439 align:start position:0%
having the department of safety feel
 
04:15:33.290 --> 04:15:33.300 align:start position:0%
comfortable about releasing these calls
 
04:15:35.389 --> 04:15:35.399 align:start position:0%
I guess from an attorney's perspective
 
04:15:37.849 --> 04:15:37.859 align:start position:0%
representing these folks sure would it
 
04:15:41.330 --> 04:15:41.340 align:start position:0%
be ideal if I could get a 9-1-1 call in
 
04:15:43.849 --> 04:15:43.859 align:start position:0%
every case every single time yeah that
 
04:15:47.150 --> 04:15:47.160 align:start position:0%
would be this gives me a lot more than I
 
04:15:51.110 --> 04:15:51.120 align:start position:0%
have now so it's a great step the thing
 
04:15:53.870 --> 04:15:53.880 align:start position:0%
is is if we know who the caller is or if
 
04:15:56.570 --> 04:15:56.580 align:start position:0%
the caller is somebody that's related or
 
04:15:58.729 --> 04:15:58.739 align:start position:0%
a family or friend of our clients will
 
04:16:00.229 --> 04:16:00.239 align:start position:0%
be able to work with that person to get
 
04:16:01.969 --> 04:16:01.979 align:start position:0%
a release and to get the records but if
 
04:16:04.010 --> 04:16:04.020 align:start position:0%
it's a total stranger the situation you
 
04:16:05.870 --> 04:16:05.880 align:start position:0%
brought up I'd have to go to court and
 
04:16:07.790 --> 04:16:07.800 align:start position:0%
get a subpoena and so it's not that I
 
04:16:09.950 --> 04:16:09.960 align:start position:0%
can't get that and there are some times
 
04:16:11.450 --> 04:16:11.460 align:start position:0%
where you just that's what you need to
 
04:16:14.150 --> 04:16:14.160 align:start position:0%
do but we're trying to avoid
 
04:16:16.550 --> 04:16:16.560 align:start position:0%
flooding the courts with issue they
 
04:16:18.710 --> 04:16:18.720 align:start position:0%
already have so much on their plate if
 
04:16:20.630 --> 04:16:20.640 align:start position:0%
we can take things off their plate
 
04:16:22.969 --> 04:16:22.979 align:start position:0%
that's great so no there is still a gap
 
04:16:25.729 --> 04:16:25.739 align:start position:0%
there are still circumstances where we
 
04:16:27.769 --> 04:16:27.779 align:start position:0%
wouldn't be entitled to the 911 calls is
 
04:16:30.170 --> 04:16:30.180 align:start position:0%
that ideal no but did it seem like a
 
04:16:32.570 --> 04:16:32.580 align:start position:0%
fair compromise being able to come up
 
04:16:34.670 --> 04:16:34.680 align:start position:0%
with language that law enforcement and
 
04:16:36.229 --> 04:16:36.239 align:start position:0%
the department of safety we're okay with
 
04:16:36.239 --> 04:16:37.969 align:start position:0%
the department of safety we're okay with
yes

04:16:37.969 --> 04:16:37.979 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:16:41.030 --> 04:16:41.040 align:start position:0%
you're welcome representative Perez
 
04:16:43.849 --> 04:16:43.859 align:start position:0%
I guess fortunately that our town did
 
04:16:45.469 --> 04:16:45.479 align:start position:0%
not realize that they didn't have to
 
04:16:48.830 --> 04:16:48.840 align:start position:0%
release that information but
 
04:16:52.309 --> 04:16:52.319 align:start position:0%
consider that that case they were told
 
04:16:54.710 --> 04:16:54.720 align:start position:0%
that they never received it the family
 
04:16:56.870 --> 04:16:56.880 align:start position:0%
knows they did receive it they would
 
04:16:59.090 --> 04:16:59.100 align:start position:0%
have to get a lawyer to get that re
 
04:16:59.100 --> 04:17:01.130 align:start position:0%
have to get a lawyer to get that re
released

04:17:01.130 --> 04:17:01.140 align:start position:0%
released
 
04:17:04.670 --> 04:17:04.680 align:start position:0%
is there any I mean
 
04:17:07.370 --> 04:17:07.380 align:start position:0%
having to get a lawyer and pay to get
 
04:17:09.050 --> 04:17:09.060 align:start position:0%
something to prove that you made a phone
 
04:17:09.060 --> 04:17:10.389 align:start position:0%
something to prove that you made a phone
call

04:17:10.389 --> 04:17:10.399 align:start position:0%
call
 
04:17:13.729 --> 04:17:13.739 align:start position:0%
that's not helping the individual with
 
04:17:16.490 --> 04:17:16.500 align:start position:0%
that so but that's the only way this can
 
04:17:19.550 --> 04:17:19.560 align:start position:0%
happen is to get a lawyer
 
04:17:22.969 --> 04:17:22.979 align:start position:0%
no somebody doesn't need a lawyer they
 
04:17:24.290 --> 04:17:24.300 align:start position:0%
would have to go to the court though
 
04:17:26.689 --> 04:17:26.699 align:start position:0%
because so right now
 
04:17:30.889 --> 04:17:30.899 align:start position:0%
under our law you can't file on 91a
 
04:17:33.349 --> 04:17:33.359 align:start position:0%
write to no request for a 9-1-1 call
 
04:17:36.110 --> 04:17:36.120 align:start position:0%
that's the status of our law right and
 
04:17:37.910 --> 04:17:37.920 align:start position:0%
so there are a couple exceptions and
 
04:17:40.070 --> 04:17:40.080 align:start position:0%
we're trying to add another one but what
 
04:17:41.210 --> 04:17:41.220 align:start position:0%
you're talking about is really
 
04:17:43.370 --> 04:17:43.380 align:start position:0%
fundamentally taking a look at New
 
04:17:46.010 --> 04:17:46.020 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's right to no law which is a
 
04:17:46.020 --> 04:17:46.910 align:start position:0%
Hampshire's right to no law which is a
very

04:17:46.910 --> 04:17:46.920 align:start position:0%
very
 
04:17:50.210 --> 04:17:50.220 align:start position:0%
a much bigger issue so
 
04:17:51.769 --> 04:17:51.779 align:start position:0%
um in in the situation that you brought
 
04:17:54.050 --> 04:17:54.060 align:start position:0%
up there is a bit of a gap
 
04:17:56.030 --> 04:17:56.040 align:start position:0%
um and so the question is do you I think
 
04:17:57.830 --> 04:17:57.840 align:start position:0%
it's a balancing act do you make the
 
04:18:00.110 --> 04:18:00.120 align:start position:0%
calls available to anybody for any
 
04:18:03.410 --> 04:18:03.420 align:start position:0%
reason or do you have you know and if
 
04:18:05.030 --> 04:18:05.040 align:start position:0%
the answer is no then what's their other
 
04:18:06.710 --> 04:18:06.720 align:start position:0%
option their other option is to go to
 
04:18:08.269 --> 04:18:08.279 align:start position:0%
court so they don't need a lawyer to go
 
04:18:09.769 --> 04:18:09.779 align:start position:0%
to court they could certainly represent
 
04:18:11.450 --> 04:18:11.460 align:start position:0%
themselves and ask the judge for an
 
04:18:13.429 --> 04:18:13.439 align:start position:0%
order to get the call but
 
04:18:15.830 --> 04:18:15.840 align:start position:0%
yes it is forcing litigation in those
 
04:18:17.510 --> 04:18:17.520 align:start position:0%
factors but that's it's a little bit of
 
04:18:19.790 --> 04:18:19.800 align:start position:0%
a different issue
 
04:18:21.590 --> 04:18:21.600 align:start position:0%
than than what we're trying to
 
04:18:24.290 --> 04:18:24.300 align:start position:0%
accomplish but I understand yeah
 
04:18:25.969 --> 04:18:25.979 align:start position:0%
other questions for this witness
 
04:18:27.830 --> 04:18:27.840 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
 
04:18:27.840 --> 04:18:28.790 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander thank you Mr
chair

04:18:28.790 --> 04:18:28.800 align:start position:0%
chair
 
04:18:30.290 --> 04:18:30.300 align:start position:0%
um thank you for taking my question do
 
04:18:31.250 --> 04:18:31.260 align:start position:0%
you see
 
04:18:33.469 --> 04:18:33.479 align:start position:0%
um I I'm concerned we're opening up a
 
04:18:34.969 --> 04:18:34.979 align:start position:0%
barn door but like only a little bit do
 
04:18:36.950 --> 04:18:36.960 align:start position:0%
you see like an equity concern when you
 
04:18:38.929 --> 04:18:38.939 align:start position:0%
have just the person who made the call
 
04:18:41.330 --> 04:18:41.340 align:start position:0%
and not the subject of the call I to go
 
04:18:43.550 --> 04:18:43.560 align:start position:0%
off of representative's
 
04:18:46.130 --> 04:18:46.140 align:start position:0%
um comment would it be would it be
 
04:18:48.469 --> 04:18:48.479 align:start position:0%
better and more Equitable if we did
 
04:18:50.030 --> 04:18:50.040 align:start position:0%
amend this to add if you were the
 
04:18:52.189 --> 04:18:52.199 align:start position:0%
subject of a 9-1-1 call you should have
 
04:18:53.689 --> 04:18:53.699 align:start position:0%
access to that information because I see
 
04:18:56.210 --> 04:18:56.220 align:start position:0%
that as an equity concern that only some
 
04:18:58.370 --> 04:18:58.380 align:start position:0%
get access to it not everybody who's a
 
04:18:59.410 --> 04:18:59.420 align:start position:0%
part of it
 
04:19:01.929 --> 04:19:01.939 align:start position:0%
yes I
 
04:19:05.689 --> 04:19:05.699 align:start position:0%
the way we envision this working in
 
04:19:09.410 --> 04:19:09.420 align:start position:0%
reality is that it would be our clients
 
04:19:12.050 --> 04:19:12.060 align:start position:0%
or our clients family that is the
 
04:19:14.030 --> 04:19:14.040 align:start position:0%
subject of the call and so under this
 
04:19:14.040 --> 04:19:15.229 align:start position:0%
subject of the call and so under this
amendment

04:19:15.229 --> 04:19:15.239 align:start position:0%
amendment
 
04:19:17.450 --> 04:19:17.460 align:start position:0%
the caller gets it
 
04:19:19.729 --> 04:19:19.739 align:start position:0%
or the caller's legal representative
 
04:19:19.739 --> 04:19:21.229 align:start position:0%
or the caller's legal representative
meaning

04:19:21.229 --> 04:19:21.239 align:start position:0%
meaning
 
04:19:23.689 --> 04:19:23.699 align:start position:0%
if my client is injured and didn't make
 
04:19:25.670 --> 04:19:25.680 align:start position:0%
the call but somebody made a call on
 
04:19:27.769 --> 04:19:27.779 align:start position:0%
their behalf we can still get the call
 
04:19:29.689 --> 04:19:29.699 align:start position:0%
so long as that individual will work
 
04:19:33.370 --> 04:19:33.380 align:start position:0%
with us right and so
 
04:19:35.450 --> 04:19:35.460 align:start position:0%
one of the
 
04:19:38.689 --> 04:19:38.699 align:start position:0%
things that we tried to balance is
 
04:19:40.429 --> 04:19:40.439 align:start position:0%
generally the state of New Hampshire
 
04:19:43.610 --> 04:19:43.620 align:start position:0%
feels very strongly about individual
 
04:19:46.130 --> 04:19:46.140 align:start position:0%
citizens right to privacy right we have
 
04:19:50.389 --> 04:19:50.399 align:start position:0%
a very robust privacy concerns in this
 
04:19:53.150 --> 04:19:53.160 align:start position:0%
state and so any time you're talking
 
04:19:53.160 --> 04:19:54.410 align:start position:0%
state and so any time you're talking
about

04:19:54.410 --> 04:19:54.420 align:start position:0%
about
 
04:19:56.630 --> 04:19:56.640 align:start position:0%
releasing additional records we had to
 
04:19:58.670 --> 04:19:58.680 align:start position:0%
balance it with those privacy concerns
 
04:20:03.050 --> 04:20:03.060 align:start position:0%
and so yes again ideally it would be
 
04:20:05.750 --> 04:20:05.760 align:start position:0%
broader than what we have now but this
 
04:20:07.610 --> 04:20:07.620 align:start position:0%
was something that we could live with
 
04:20:09.889 --> 04:20:09.899 align:start position:0%
and it was a negotiated compromise
 
04:20:12.050 --> 04:20:12.060 align:start position:0%
between the stakeholders and the concern
 
04:20:15.530 --> 04:20:15.540 align:start position:0%
was if we really pushed for everything
 
04:20:17.330 --> 04:20:17.340 align:start position:0%
that we would want then we would have
 
04:20:19.070 --> 04:20:19.080 align:start position:0%
had significant opposition from law
 
04:20:20.809 --> 04:20:20.819 align:start position:0%
enforcement in the department of safety
 
04:20:23.689 --> 04:20:23.699 align:start position:0%
and so the reality was is we felt it was
 
04:20:26.030 --> 04:20:26.040 align:start position:0%
much better for our clients to get
 
04:20:28.370 --> 04:20:28.380 align:start position:0%
something than to get nothing and this
 
04:20:30.110 --> 04:20:30.120 align:start position:0%
was a reasonable compromise that we can
 
04:20:32.030 --> 04:20:32.040 align:start position:0%
live with and if it doesn't work in a
 
04:20:33.469 --> 04:20:33.479 align:start position:0%
couple of years and we're finding that
 
04:20:35.330 --> 04:20:35.340 align:start position:0%
we have these situations where we
 
04:20:37.010 --> 04:20:37.020 align:start position:0%
somehow can't get a call even though
 
04:20:38.750 --> 04:20:38.760 align:start position:0%
this is exactly what we tried to fix
 
04:20:40.969 --> 04:20:40.979 align:start position:0%
then I guess we'll just come back and
 
04:20:42.710 --> 04:20:42.720 align:start position:0%
ask you to take a you know look at it
 
04:20:44.929 --> 04:20:44.939 align:start position:0%
again but for now
 
04:20:48.830 --> 04:20:48.840 align:start position:0%
we feel pretty confident that 95 percent
 
04:20:50.689 --> 04:20:50.699 align:start position:0%
of the times we need these calls under
 
04:20:52.070 --> 04:20:52.080 align:start position:0%
this amendment we're going to be able to
 
04:20:55.010 --> 04:20:55.020 align:start position:0%
get it okay so if I could just briefly
 
04:20:57.290 --> 04:20:57.300 align:start position:0%
follow up yep I get an accident on mass
 
04:20:59.210 --> 04:20:59.220 align:start position:0%
Road in Goffstown and representative
 
04:21:01.969 --> 04:21:01.979 align:start position:0%
Lanza sees that somebody hit me I didn't
 
04:21:04.610 --> 04:21:04.620 align:start position:0%
hit the other person but I didn't know
 
04:21:06.229 --> 04:21:06.239 align:start position:0%
she made a call on that behalf and that
 
04:21:08.450 --> 04:21:08.460 align:start position:0%
could have in in an insurance claim
 
04:21:11.269 --> 04:21:11.279 align:start position:0%
could have helped me get the get the aid
 
04:21:12.710 --> 04:21:12.720 align:start position:0%
but because I was the subject of the
 
04:21:13.849 --> 04:21:13.859 align:start position:0%
call and that call I didn't even know
 
04:21:15.530 --> 04:21:15.540 align:start position:0%
that call was made and that information
 
04:21:17.269 --> 04:21:17.279 align:start position:0%
was provided
 
04:21:18.889 --> 04:21:18.899 align:start position:0%
I wouldn't have access to the call
 
04:21:21.050 --> 04:21:21.060 align:start position:0%
that's about me under this language
 
04:21:22.910 --> 04:21:22.920 align:start position:0%
you it's not a criminal case it's like
 
04:21:25.070 --> 04:21:25.080 align:start position:0%
for insurance purposes or whatever you
 
04:21:26.929 --> 04:21:26.939 align:start position:0%
would only have access to the call if
 
04:21:26.939 --> 04:21:28.130 align:start position:0%
would only have access to the call if
representative

04:21:28.130 --> 04:21:28.140 align:start position:0%
representative
 
04:21:28.140 --> 04:21:29.990 align:start position:0%
representative
lonza

04:21:29.990 --> 04:21:30.000 align:start position:0%
lonza
 
04:21:32.330 --> 04:21:32.340 align:start position:0%
um was willing to sign a release
 
04:21:34.250 --> 04:21:34.260 align:start position:0%
allowing you to get access to the call
 
04:21:36.590 --> 04:21:36.600 align:start position:0%
she made the call it's her voice on the
 
04:21:39.050 --> 04:21:39.060 align:start position:0%
recording okay so that's why the
 
04:21:41.330 --> 04:21:41.340 align:start position:0%
department of safety was very adamant
 
04:21:43.309 --> 04:21:43.319 align:start position:0%
that they wanted to call her the person
 
04:21:45.830 --> 04:21:45.840 align:start position:0%
who's calling and speaking to them to
 
04:21:48.170 --> 04:21:48.180 align:start position:0%
release the call record it wasn't as
 
04:21:50.090 --> 04:21:50.100 align:start position:0%
important to them about who the patient
 
04:21:53.330 --> 04:21:53.340 align:start position:0%
was it was the the actual person on the
 
04:21:56.990 --> 04:21:57.000 align:start position:0%
phone and in your situation if you don't
 
04:21:59.689 --> 04:21:59.699 align:start position:0%
even know the call exists then you know
 
04:22:01.429 --> 04:22:01.439 align:start position:0%
it's not like we're really worried about
 
04:22:03.349 --> 04:22:03.359 align:start position:0%
fighting to get some evidence that we
 
04:22:04.910 --> 04:22:04.920 align:start position:0%
don't even know exists you know what I
 
04:22:07.429 --> 04:22:07.439 align:start position:0%
mean but most of the time if there's a
 
04:22:10.070 --> 04:22:10.080 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 call that information is typically
 
04:22:12.290 --> 04:22:12.300 align:start position:0%
put in the police report that there was
 
04:22:14.750 --> 04:22:14.760 align:start position:0%
an individual who called 9-1-1 a lot of
 
04:22:16.969 --> 04:22:16.979 align:start position:0%
times the identity of the 9-1-1 callers
 
04:22:20.389 --> 04:22:20.399 align:start position:0%
in the police report so and we can ask
 
04:22:23.030 --> 04:22:23.040 align:start position:0%
the department of safety to
 
04:22:24.950 --> 04:22:24.960 align:start position:0%
um confirm whether there is a 9-1-1 call
 
04:22:26.630 --> 04:22:26.640 align:start position:0%
or not and then we would have the
 
04:22:28.490 --> 04:22:28.500 align:start position:0%
opportunity to try and track down the
 
04:22:30.229 --> 04:22:30.239 align:start position:0%
witness and get them to release the call
 
04:22:32.750 --> 04:22:32.760 align:start position:0%
shy of that you'd have to go to court so
 
04:22:34.729 --> 04:22:34.739 align:start position:0%
it's not like you couldn't ever get it
 
04:22:37.189 --> 04:22:37.199 align:start position:0%
it just it requires the extra step that
 
04:22:39.889 --> 04:22:39.899 align:start position:0%
we're trying to avoid it's not ideal
 
04:22:42.349 --> 04:22:42.359 align:start position:0%
it's not ideal but it is better than
 
04:22:44.269 --> 04:22:44.279 align:start position:0%
what we got and it's a compromise and we
 
04:22:46.189 --> 04:22:46.199 align:start position:0%
think practically 95 percent of the time
 
04:22:48.530 --> 04:22:48.540 align:start position:0%
it's going to be fine
 
04:22:50.630 --> 04:22:50.640 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
04:22:53.150 --> 04:22:53.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos thank you Mr
 
04:22:56.330 --> 04:22:56.340 align:start position:0%
chair attorney Ross do you have the um
 
04:22:58.429 --> 04:22:58.439 align:start position:0%
name and citation to the New Hampshire
 
04:23:01.610 --> 04:23:01.620 align:start position:0%
Supreme Court opinion that Mr frenette
 
04:23:04.610 --> 04:23:04.620 align:start position:0%
referred to yes so that was a really
 
04:23:06.469 --> 04:23:06.479 align:start position:0%
interesting case
 
04:23:09.590 --> 04:23:09.600 align:start position:0%
um so what that case
 
04:23:12.050 --> 04:23:12.060 align:start position:0%
and I'm trying not to go too much down a
 
04:23:13.429 --> 04:23:13.439 align:start position:0%
rabbit hole with some of the privacy
 
04:23:17.929 --> 04:23:17.939 align:start position:0%
concerns but the real issue in the case
 
04:23:21.290 --> 04:23:21.300 align:start position:0%
it's B and C management versus New
 
04:23:23.229 --> 04:23:23.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire division of Emergency Services
 
04:23:27.950 --> 04:23:27.960 align:start position:0%
in the case citation is 175 New
 
04:23:31.610 --> 04:23:31.620 align:start position:0%
Hampshire 20. and it's a 2022 New
 
04:23:33.410 --> 04:23:33.420 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Supreme Court case so very
 
04:23:35.809 --> 04:23:35.819 align:start position:0%
recent case what was interesting about
 
04:23:37.450 --> 04:23:37.460 align:start position:0%
this case so
 
04:23:40.670 --> 04:23:40.680 align:start position:0%
a individual was injured while they were
 
04:23:43.010 --> 04:23:43.020 align:start position:0%
at a hotel
 
04:23:45.889 --> 04:23:45.899 align:start position:0%
the hotel was trying to get a copy of
 
04:23:49.550 --> 04:23:49.560 align:start position:0%
 
04:23:52.010 --> 04:23:52.020 align:start position:0%
it wasn't the caller themselves that
 
04:23:53.630 --> 04:23:53.640 align:start position:0%
were trying to get a copy of the 911
 
04:23:55.490 --> 04:23:55.500 align:start position:0%
call the hotel wanted it for the
 
04:23:57.050 --> 04:23:57.060 align:start position:0%
purposes of a fight that they were
 
04:24:00.349 --> 04:24:00.359 align:start position:0%
having over Insurance the claim
 
04:24:02.929 --> 04:24:02.939 align:start position:0%
in judge McNamara
 
04:24:07.010 --> 04:24:07.020 align:start position:0%
this this case lays out that there was
 
04:24:10.010 --> 04:24:10.020 align:start position:0%
no legal mechanism for the hotel to get
 
04:24:14.210 --> 04:24:14.220 align:start position:0%
that call shy of uh litigation and
 
04:24:16.309 --> 04:24:16.319 align:start position:0%
subpoena in a court order saying that
 
04:24:19.250 --> 04:24:19.260 align:start position:0%
the court could get it and so in in that
 
04:24:21.170 --> 04:24:21.180 align:start position:0%
was because and that's really the case
 
04:24:24.410 --> 04:24:24.420 align:start position:0%
that lays out that says 9-1-1 calls are
 
04:24:26.389 --> 04:24:26.399 align:start position:0%
not subject to right to know there are
 
04:24:29.330 --> 04:24:29.340 align:start position:0%
only two exceptions this isn't one and
 
04:24:31.070 --> 04:24:31.080 align:start position:0%
they said in the case essentially
 
04:24:32.990 --> 04:24:33.000 align:start position:0%
legislature if you think that there
 
04:24:34.849 --> 04:24:34.859 align:start position:0%
should be more exceptions and there
 
04:24:36.229 --> 04:24:36.239 align:start position:0%
should be other times where we could

04:25:23.750 --> 04:25:23.760 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chair members of
 
04:25:26.090 --> 04:25:26.100 align:start position:0%
the committee for indulging us today for
 
04:25:27.469 --> 04:25:27.479 align:start position:0%
the record my name is Marissa Chase I'm
 
04:25:28.490 --> 04:25:28.500 align:start position:0%
the executive director for the New
 
04:25:30.229 --> 04:25:30.239 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association for justice I just
 
04:25:31.670 --> 04:25:31.680 align:start position:0%
wanted to say a few things mechanically
 
04:25:34.429 --> 04:25:34.439 align:start position:0%
about Senate Bill 183 which we are in
 
04:25:35.870 --> 04:25:35.880 align:start position:0%
strong support of and thank you Mr chair
 
04:25:38.870 --> 04:25:38.880 align:start position:0%
for signing on as a co-sponsor I just
 
04:25:41.750 --> 04:25:41.760 align:start position:0%
want to note anytime that 106h is
 
04:25:42.889 --> 04:25:42.899 align:start position:0%
touched which there have been bills
 
04:25:45.170 --> 04:25:45.180 align:start position:0%
filed in the past to that seek to amend
 
04:25:46.610 --> 04:25:46.620 align:start position:0%
and create more exemptions under the
 
04:25:49.370 --> 04:25:49.380 align:start position:0%
9-1-1 status under the
 
04:25:52.250 --> 04:25:52.260 align:start position:0%
statute for 9-1-1 calls the department
 
04:25:53.630 --> 04:25:53.640 align:start position:0%
of safety you know they were really
 
04:25:55.550 --> 04:25:55.560 align:start position:0%
upfront with us and said you know
 
04:25:57.410 --> 04:25:57.420 align:start position:0%
we never support this we're never
 
04:25:59.330 --> 04:25:59.340 align:start position:0%
neutral on this this makes our job
 
04:26:02.389 --> 04:26:02.399 align:start position:0%
harder and I get it law enforcement
 
04:26:04.309 --> 04:26:04.319 align:start position:0%
First Responders were concerned that
 
04:26:06.349 --> 04:26:06.359 align:start position:0%
potentially somehow could open them up
 
04:26:09.410 --> 04:26:09.420 align:start position:0%
to more liability so we worked really
 
04:26:11.510 --> 04:26:11.520 align:start position:0%
hard before the first hearing with all
 
04:26:13.790 --> 04:26:13.800 align:start position:0%
of these stakeholders together to make
 
04:26:16.490 --> 04:26:16.500 align:start position:0%
sure that everybody was comfortable and
 
04:26:18.110 --> 04:26:18.120 align:start position:0%
there was no opposition of the hearing
 
04:26:19.610 --> 04:26:19.620 align:start position:0%
on this bill in the Senate it was not
 
04:26:21.830 --> 04:26:21.840 align:start position:0%
amended and today thankfully there's no
 
04:26:25.250 --> 04:26:25.260 align:start position:0%
opposition that I know of either
 
04:26:25.260 --> 04:26:26.590 align:start position:0%
opposition that I know of either
um

04:26:26.590 --> 04:26:26.600 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:26:29.210 --> 04:26:29.220 align:start position:0%
representative Alexander mentioned um
 
04:26:31.729 --> 04:26:31.739 align:start position:0%
you know the subject like if you're the
 
04:26:33.170 --> 04:26:33.180 align:start position:0%
subject of the call I don't know
 
04:26:34.969 --> 04:26:34.979 align:start position:0%
practically how they would be able to
 
04:26:37.370 --> 04:26:37.380 align:start position:0%
even like catalog that information in
 
04:26:38.750 --> 04:26:38.760 align:start position:0%
their system you know what I mean if
 
04:26:41.149 --> 04:26:41.159 align:start position:0%
representative lonza saw a crash in
 
04:26:43.670 --> 04:26:43.680 align:start position:0%
Goffstown she'd probably just report saw
 
04:26:45.530 --> 04:26:45.540 align:start position:0%
crash in Goffstown wouldn't know that it
 
04:26:47.750 --> 04:26:47.760 align:start position:0%
was representative Joe Alexander crashed
 
04:26:49.189 --> 04:26:49.199 align:start position:0%
his car does that make sense I was just
 
04:26:50.510 --> 04:26:50.520 align:start position:0%
kind of thinking through that yeah I'm
 
04:26:52.610 --> 04:26:52.620 align:start position:0%
thinking through two if I could and she
 
04:26:54.229 --> 04:26:54.239 align:start position:0%
would be like the silk like the red Jeep
 
04:26:56.389 --> 04:26:56.399 align:start position:0%
he'll hit the silver Hyundai and I drive
 
04:26:57.830 --> 04:26:57.840 align:start position:0%
the silver Hyundai you know like that
 
04:27:00.649 --> 04:27:00.659 align:start position:0%
kind of information exactly
 
04:27:00.659 --> 04:27:01.910 align:start position:0%
kind of information exactly
um

04:27:01.910 --> 04:27:01.920 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:27:03.649 --> 04:27:03.659 align:start position:0%
so it again went through the Senate
 
04:27:06.050 --> 04:27:06.060 align:start position:0%
unanimous on consent there were some
 
04:27:07.070 --> 04:27:07.080 align:start position:0%
folks in the Senate like what
 
04:27:08.630 --> 04:27:08.640 align:start position:0%
representative koutab mentioned earlier
 
04:27:11.269 --> 04:27:11.279 align:start position:0%
that thought you know would it make more
 
04:27:13.550 --> 04:27:13.560 align:start position:0%
sense for it to be broader
 
04:27:16.010 --> 04:27:16.020 align:start position:0%
um and again I just stress that this is
 
04:27:17.689 --> 04:27:17.699 align:start position:0%
a very delicate balancing act that we
 
04:27:19.610 --> 04:27:19.620 align:start position:0%
worked really hard to not let the
 
04:27:22.070 --> 04:27:22.080 align:start position:0%
perfect be the enemy of the good since
 
04:27:24.170 --> 04:27:24.180 align:start position:0%
the case BCB management versus division
 
04:27:25.910 --> 04:27:25.920 align:start position:0%
of Environmental Services happened in
 
04:27:28.849 --> 04:27:28.859 align:start position:0%
2022 I have been contacted by many of
 
04:27:30.710 --> 04:27:30.720 align:start position:0%
our members saying that information they
 
04:27:33.290 --> 04:27:33.300 align:start position:0%
could once access they no longer could
 
04:27:34.849 --> 04:27:34.859 align:start position:0%
when representing their clients and
 
04:27:37.010 --> 04:27:37.020 align:start position:0%
trying to get settlement resolutions and
 
04:27:38.750 --> 04:27:38.760 align:start position:0%
I just want to make really clear that
 
04:27:40.610 --> 04:27:40.620 align:start position:0%
none of this information that this bill
 
04:27:40.620 --> 04:27:41.870 align:start position:0%
none of this information that this bill
would

04:27:41.870 --> 04:27:41.880 align:start position:0%
would
 
04:27:44.090 --> 04:27:44.100 align:start position:0%
um you know give to someone that fills
 
04:27:45.649 --> 04:27:45.659 align:start position:0%
out the form
 
04:27:47.750 --> 04:27:47.760 align:start position:0%
they wouldn't be able to get anyway it's
 
04:27:49.610 --> 04:27:49.620 align:start position:0%
just one step earlier it's without
 
04:27:52.010 --> 04:27:52.020 align:start position:0%
having to file a lawsuit without
 
04:27:53.809 --> 04:27:53.819 align:start position:0%
actually having to put a case in suit
 
04:27:56.210 --> 04:27:56.220 align:start position:0%
because as we heard earlier either from
 
04:27:59.990 --> 04:28:00.000 align:start position:0%
Mr frenette or attorney Ross over 90
 
04:28:02.510 --> 04:28:02.520 align:start position:0%
percent of cases of civil cases in New
 
04:28:05.689 --> 04:28:05.699 align:start position:0%
Hampshire settle pre-suit so
 
04:28:07.670 --> 04:28:07.680 align:start position:0%
you settle a lawsuit before you have to
 
04:28:10.429 --> 04:28:10.439 align:start position:0%
file a lawsuit if that helps to clarify
 
04:28:13.610 --> 04:28:13.620 align:start position:0%
things in your brains that helped me
 
04:28:13.620 --> 04:28:14.389 align:start position:0%
things in your brains that helped me
um

04:28:14.389 --> 04:28:14.399 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:28:17.330 --> 04:28:17.340 align:start position:0%
and also interesting in the case the BCB
 
04:28:20.450 --> 04:28:20.460 align:start position:0%
management case the court invited the
 
04:28:22.790 --> 04:28:22.800 align:start position:0%
legislature to take action and look at
 
04:28:24.349 --> 04:28:24.359 align:start position:0%
this statute and make an amendment
 
04:28:26.990 --> 04:28:27.000 align:start position:0%
because they noted that when a statute
 
04:28:30.170 --> 04:28:30.180 align:start position:0%
lays out specific exemptions it's pretty
 
04:28:32.630 --> 04:28:32.640 align:start position:0%
clear you can't conceive of more than
 
04:28:34.670 --> 04:28:34.680 align:start position:0%
those that are listed so the court
 
04:28:36.590 --> 04:28:36.600 align:start position:0%
actually did invite the legislature in
 
04:28:39.070 --> 04:28:39.080 align:start position:0%
that case to take a look at the statute
 
04:28:42.469 --> 04:28:42.479 align:start position:0%
so that's why we're here today
 
04:28:45.229 --> 04:28:45.239 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
04:28:47.149 --> 04:28:47.159 align:start position:0%
see none thank you very much thank you
 
04:28:48.290 --> 04:28:48.300 align:start position:0%
Mr chair
 
04:28:49.910 --> 04:28:49.920 align:start position:0%
is there
 
04:28:52.969 --> 04:28:52.979 align:start position:0%
um anyone else who wishes to testify on
 
04:28:56.149 --> 04:28:56.159 align:start position:0%
HB 183
 
04:28:57.710 --> 04:28:57.720 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
04:28:59.149 --> 04:28:59.159 align:start position:0%
hearing on that
 
04:29:01.309 --> 04:29:01.319 align:start position:0%
and we have about two minutes to wait
 
04:29:03.050 --> 04:29:03.060 align:start position:0%
for uh
 
04:29:08.210 --> 04:29:08.220 align:start position:0%
 
04:29:08.220 --> 04:36:12.650 align:start position:0%
 
yes

04:36:12.650 --> 04:36:12.660 align:start position:0%
 
04:36:16.070 --> 04:36:16.080 align:start position:0%
all right it's uh after 2 30. so I will
 
04:36:19.670 --> 04:36:19.680 align:start position:0%
uh uh open the hearing on Senate Bill
 
04:36:23.570 --> 04:36:23.580 align:start position:0%
250 and I will recognize uh one of the
 
04:36:26.631 --> 04:36:26.641 align:start position:0%
sponsors uh Senator Gray
 
04:36:30.529 --> 04:36:30.539 align:start position:0%
uh thank you Mr chair uh the reason that
 
04:36:33.289 --> 04:36:33.299 align:start position:0%
I'm here instead of Senator Lang is
 
04:36:35.090 --> 04:36:35.100 align:start position:0%
because I kind of hijacked the bill on
 
04:36:39.170 --> 04:36:39.180 align:start position:0%
him okay and I wrote the amendment that
 
04:36:40.849 --> 04:36:40.859 align:start position:0%
you see in front of you
 
04:36:42.590 --> 04:36:42.600 align:start position:0%
but let me give you a little history
 
04:36:46.670 --> 04:36:46.680 align:start position:0%
okay the bill is presented to me added a
 
04:36:49.849 --> 04:36:49.859 align:start position:0%
paragraph four about having remote
 
04:36:53.689 --> 04:36:53.699 align:start position:0%
meetings and they repeated a lot of the
 
04:36:56.390 --> 04:36:56.400 align:start position:0%
stuff that was in paragraph three and
 
04:37:00.051 --> 04:37:00.061 align:start position:0%
which is in front of you right now uh
 
04:37:02.150 --> 04:37:02.160 align:start position:0%
and but it didn't do it
 
04:37:04.070 --> 04:37:04.080 align:start position:0%
in every case
 
04:37:06.709 --> 04:37:06.719 align:start position:0%
so I said I I couldn't live with that if
 
04:37:09.109 --> 04:37:09.119 align:start position:0%
I was going to have remote meetings I
 
04:37:12.051 --> 04:37:12.061 align:start position:0%
needed whether it was full attendance
 
04:37:14.449 --> 04:37:14.459 align:start position:0%
required or partial attendance required
 
04:37:17.269 --> 04:37:17.279 align:start position:0%
that the wording be the same except for
 
04:37:19.551 --> 04:37:19.561 align:start position:0%
the requirement for attendance
 
04:37:22.131 --> 04:37:22.141 align:start position:0%
you don't have those versions in front
 
04:37:23.830 --> 04:37:23.840 align:start position:0%
of you those were actually
 
04:37:26.570 --> 04:37:26.580 align:start position:0%
amendments uh
 
04:37:26.580 --> 04:37:28.689 align:start position:0%
amendments uh
um

04:37:28.689 --> 04:37:28.699 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:33.429 --> 04:37:33.439 align:start position:0%
 
04:37:37.551 --> 04:37:37.561 align:start position:0%
2023.0713s and if someone wants a copy
 
04:37:40.490 --> 04:37:40.500 align:start position:0%
of those afterwards we will certainly
 
04:37:43.609 --> 04:37:43.619 align:start position:0%
make them available to you so in doing
 
04:37:48.170 --> 04:37:48.180 align:start position:0%
that we we restructured Roman 3 the way
 
04:37:52.510 --> 04:37:52.520 align:start position:0%
you see it there and we had a Roman 4
 
04:37:55.070 --> 04:37:55.080 align:start position:0%
which basically said the government body
 
04:37:57.670 --> 04:37:57.680 align:start position:0%
of a political subdivision made by
 
04:38:01.131 --> 04:38:01.141 align:start position:0%
two-thirds of it three-fifths vote adopt
 
04:38:05.150 --> 04:38:05.160 align:start position:0%
a local bylaw rule ordinance authorizing
 
04:38:07.849 --> 04:38:07.859 align:start position:0%
members of public bodies as defined in
 
04:38:12.490 --> 04:38:12.500 align:start position:0%
RSA 91-a colon 1 dash
 
04:38:18.230 --> 04:38:18.240 align:start position:0%
a Roman 4 d uh in political subdivision
 
04:38:20.929 --> 04:38:20.939 align:start position:0%
to participate in a meeting by
 
04:38:23.269 --> 04:38:23.279 align:start position:0%
electronic or other means of
 
04:38:25.631 --> 04:38:25.641 align:start position:0%
communications were less than a quorum
 
04:38:29.631 --> 04:38:29.641 align:start position:0%
but not less than one-third of the total
 
04:38:32.289 --> 04:38:32.299 align:start position:0%
membership of the public body shall be
 
04:38:35.150 --> 04:38:35.160 align:start position:0%
present at the physical location the
 
04:38:37.849 --> 04:38:37.859 align:start position:0%
meaning the chair shall determine that
 
04:38:40.609 --> 04:38:40.619 align:start position:0%
the meaning is a benefit to the public
 
04:38:43.131 --> 04:38:43.141 align:start position:0%
and the public body and the meeting
 
04:38:45.289 --> 04:38:45.299 align:start position:0%
shall be subject to the other provisions
 
04:38:49.429 --> 04:38:49.439 align:start position:0%
of paragraph three which you have this
 
04:38:52.070 --> 04:38:52.080 align:start position:0%
paragraph and any more stringent
 
04:38:54.170 --> 04:38:54.180 align:start position:0%
conditions established in the local
 
04:38:56.929 --> 04:38:56.939 align:start position:0%
bylaw rule ordinance The Authority
 
04:38:59.330 --> 04:38:59.340 align:start position:0%
granted under this paragraph may be
 
04:39:02.510 --> 04:39:02.520 align:start position:0%
revoked renewed or modified in the same
 
04:39:05.510 --> 04:39:05.520 align:start position:0%
manner as it is adopted the authority
 
04:39:07.910 --> 04:39:07.920 align:start position:0%
granted under this paragraph shall not
 
04:39:10.730 --> 04:39:10.740 align:start position:0%
restrict the ability of a public body to
 
04:39:12.830 --> 04:39:12.840 align:start position:0%
allow remote participation with less
 
04:39:16.310 --> 04:39:16.320 align:start position:0%
than a quorum physically present in an
 
04:39:18.289 --> 04:39:18.299 align:start position:0%
emergency and then
 
04:39:20.090 --> 04:39:20.100 align:start position:0%
all right so
 
04:39:22.090 --> 04:39:22.100 align:start position:0%
I wrote that
 
04:39:25.189 --> 04:39:25.199 align:start position:0%
nhma you know they'll they'll smile
 
04:39:27.590 --> 04:39:27.600 align:start position:0%
behind you and if that had voted they
 
04:39:30.289 --> 04:39:30.299 align:start position:0%
would be here checking the box that they
 
04:39:32.929 --> 04:39:32.939 align:start position:0%
support the bill more than likely I'm
 
04:39:34.429 --> 04:39:34.439 align:start position:0%
sure that they've checked the box that
 
04:39:36.189 --> 04:39:36.199 align:start position:0%
they don't support the bill right now
 
04:39:40.190 --> 04:39:40.200 align:start position:0%
but when I took that to the Senate and
 
04:39:42.530 --> 04:39:42.540 align:start position:0%
they said well the complaints that we've
 
04:39:46.250 --> 04:39:46.260 align:start position:0%
been getting is that it's too easy to do
 
04:39:47.630 --> 04:39:47.640 align:start position:0%
certain things
 
04:39:51.230 --> 04:39:51.240 align:start position:0%
an example of that is that in the city
 
04:39:53.030 --> 04:39:53.040 align:start position:0%
of Rochester I have a police
 
04:39:53.040 --> 04:39:54.170 align:start position:0%
of Rochester I have a police
commissioner

04:39:54.170 --> 04:39:54.180 align:start position:0%
commissioner
 
04:39:56.650 --> 04:39:56.660 align:start position:0%
that every year
 
04:40:00.110 --> 04:40:00.120 align:start position:0%
takes a
 
04:40:02.930 --> 04:40:02.940 align:start position:0%
shall we say a vacation in Florida for
 
04:40:05.570 --> 04:40:05.580 align:start position:0%
three months in fact not this year but
 
04:40:08.270 --> 04:40:08.280 align:start position:0%
the year before he was actually sworn in
 
04:40:10.610 --> 04:40:10.620 align:start position:0%
remotely because he was already down in
 
04:40:10.620 --> 04:40:11.410 align:start position:0%
remotely because he was already down in
Florida

04:40:11.410 --> 04:40:11.420 align:start position:0%
Florida
 
04:40:14.090 --> 04:40:14.100 align:start position:0%
and didn't attend the first three
 
04:40:15.708 --> 04:40:15.718 align:start position:0%
meetings of the month
 
04:40:18.288 --> 04:40:18.298 align:start position:0%
and any other meetings that they held
 
04:40:20.630 --> 04:40:20.640 align:start position:0%
because they do hold hiring meetings and
 
04:40:22.910 --> 04:40:22.920 align:start position:0%
other things and has repeated that
 
04:40:25.970 --> 04:40:25.980 align:start position:0%
behavior again this year there are other
 
04:40:30.170 --> 04:40:30.180 align:start position:0%
examples where uh people because of
 
04:40:32.690 --> 04:40:32.700 align:start position:0%
convenience say well gee it's a lot
 
04:40:34.788 --> 04:40:34.798 align:start position:0%
easier for me to hit a button you know
 
04:40:38.510 --> 04:40:38.520 align:start position:0%
and stay in my PJs than to to go to the
 
04:40:42.110 --> 04:40:42.120 align:start position:0%
meeting so that's the reason that you
 
04:40:44.990 --> 04:40:45.000 align:start position:0%
see part of what's in Roman 3 is to
 
04:40:47.090 --> 04:40:47.100 align:start position:0%
tighten up on that a little bit and add
 
04:40:49.130 --> 04:40:49.140 align:start position:0%
a little bit more definition
 
04:40:52.610 --> 04:40:52.620 align:start position:0%
uh but when it came to paragraph four uh
 
04:40:54.110 --> 04:40:54.120 align:start position:0%
I was
 
04:40:56.990 --> 04:40:57.000 align:start position:0%
come to realize that it was not going to
 
04:41:01.130 --> 04:41:01.140 align:start position:0%
get a majority vote uh in the Senate uh
 
04:41:03.470 --> 04:41:03.480 align:start position:0%
and that I needed to if I was going to
 
04:41:07.250 --> 04:41:07.260 align:start position:0%
continue this on word I needed to remove
 
04:41:11.270 --> 04:41:11.280 align:start position:0%
that from the final version the reason I
 
04:41:13.788 --> 04:41:13.798 align:start position:0%
speak about it is because I do know that
 
04:41:16.730 --> 04:41:16.740 align:start position:0%
there are a large constituency out there
 
04:41:19.670 --> 04:41:19.680 align:start position:0%
that would like that paragraph uh Roman
 
04:41:23.030 --> 04:41:23.040 align:start position:0%
4 put back in again I read it to you
 
04:41:25.250 --> 04:41:25.260 align:start position:0%
very quickly and I think I got all the
 
04:41:27.110 --> 04:41:27.120 align:start position:0%
words right you know I are an engineer
 
04:41:28.910 --> 04:41:28.920 align:start position:0%
I'm good with the numbers but you know
 
04:41:30.650 --> 04:41:30.660 align:start position:0%
those words and stuff they get in the
 
04:41:32.330 --> 04:41:32.340 align:start position:0%
way sometimes
 
04:41:36.170 --> 04:41:36.180 align:start position:0%
um all seriously back to that you know
 
04:41:38.170 --> 04:41:38.180 align:start position:0%
certainly the bill is back with you guys
 
04:41:43.550 --> 04:41:43.560 align:start position:0%
uh and if you agree that uh and like
 
04:41:47.208 --> 04:41:47.218 align:start position:0%
nhma will request to you that the the
 
04:41:49.128 --> 04:41:49.138 align:start position:0%
reason they wanted the bill in the first
 
04:41:52.190 --> 04:41:52.200 align:start position:0%
place was to provide that option for
 
04:41:55.610 --> 04:41:55.620 align:start position:0%
less than a quorum to be Pres isn't
 
04:41:58.310 --> 04:41:58.320 align:start position:0%
um that's up to you and you have some
 
04:42:01.490 --> 04:42:01.500 align:start position:0%
language that that we did talk about in
 
04:42:04.910 --> 04:42:04.920 align:start position:0%
the Senate should you choose to do it
 
04:42:08.230 --> 04:42:08.240 align:start position:0%
um but the better way to
 
04:42:11.448 --> 04:42:11.458 align:start position:0%
take care of these meetings with less
 
04:42:14.448 --> 04:42:14.458 align:start position:0%
than a quorum is probably in the
 
04:42:16.610 --> 04:42:16.620 align:start position:0%
legislation that creates the committee
 
04:42:19.850 --> 04:42:19.860 align:start position:0%
in the first place is providing that
 
04:42:23.390 --> 04:42:23.400 align:start position:0%
alternates uh may be assigned by and you
 
04:42:25.430 --> 04:42:25.440 align:start position:0%
pick the group you know two regular
 
04:42:28.610 --> 04:42:28.620 align:start position:0%
members and an alternate or whatever so
 
04:42:31.850 --> 04:42:31.860 align:start position:0%
that there are extra people but again
 
04:42:36.890 --> 04:42:36.900 align:start position:0%
that's we'll all be left up to you so
 
04:42:39.530 --> 04:42:39.540 align:start position:0%
there's questions I'd be certainly try
 
04:42:41.150 --> 04:42:41.160 align:start position:0%
to answer them for you
 
04:42:41.160 --> 04:42:42.650 align:start position:0%
to answer them for you
yes

04:42:42.650 --> 04:42:42.660 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:42:42.660 --> 04:42:43.570 align:start position:0%
yes
yes

04:42:43.570 --> 04:42:43.580 align:start position:0%
yes
 
04:42:45.890 --> 04:42:45.900 align:start position:0%
uh representative Horton thank you
 
04:42:47.448 --> 04:42:47.458 align:start position:0%
partially answered my question with
 
04:42:49.368 --> 04:42:49.378 align:start position:0%
remark about the alternate she tossed it
 
04:42:51.350 --> 04:42:51.360 align:start position:0%
at the end but
 
04:42:53.330 --> 04:42:53.340 align:start position:0%
if you have uh was that a police chief
 
04:42:55.750 --> 04:42:55.760 align:start position:0%
in Rochester what was that anecdote fire
 
04:42:58.670 --> 04:42:58.680 align:start position:0%
it was a police commissioner a police
 
04:43:00.410 --> 04:43:00.420 align:start position:0%
commissioner is it
 
04:43:03.170 --> 04:43:03.180 align:start position:0%
is it necessarily worse to have a police
 
04:43:06.110 --> 04:43:06.120 align:start position:0%
commissioner zooming in from
 
04:43:08.150 --> 04:43:08.160 align:start position:0%
the remote locations and having a police
 
04:43:10.490 --> 04:43:10.500 align:start position:0%
commissioner who doesn't participate in
 
04:43:12.830 --> 04:43:12.840 align:start position:0%
the meeting at all or to have members
 
04:43:14.570 --> 04:43:14.580 align:start position:0%
who if they don't feel like changing
 
04:43:16.128 --> 04:43:16.138 align:start position:0%
other PJs just skipping the meeting
 
04:43:18.650 --> 04:43:18.660 align:start position:0%
rather than uh at least getting dressed
 
04:43:20.868 --> 04:43:20.878 align:start position:0%
from the waist up and zooming in is that
 
04:43:23.868 --> 04:43:23.878 align:start position:0%
necessarily well I mean obviously I'm
 
04:43:25.490 --> 04:43:25.500 align:start position:0%
not you're trying to force I mean I
 
04:43:26.690 --> 04:43:26.700 align:start position:0%
assume you're probably trying to force
 
04:43:30.050 --> 04:43:30.060 align:start position:0%
them to be there in person but if they
 
04:43:32.208 --> 04:43:32.218 align:start position:0%
can't or don't or can't be there in
 
04:43:33.470 --> 04:43:33.480 align:start position:0%
person is it
 
04:43:35.628 --> 04:43:35.638 align:start position:0%
is it worse to have them not there at
 
04:43:37.788 --> 04:43:37.798 align:start position:0%
all than to have them zooming in I don't
 
04:43:39.890 --> 04:43:39.900 align:start position:0%
well remember that if you look at
 
04:43:43.368 --> 04:43:43.378 align:start position:0%
paragraph three it gives the chairman of
 
04:43:44.810 --> 04:43:44.820 align:start position:0%
the committee
 
04:43:48.350 --> 04:43:48.360 align:start position:0%
um the ability to say that your remote
 
04:43:53.270 --> 04:43:53.280 align:start position:0%
participation uh in a meeting is
 
04:43:55.070 --> 04:43:55.080 align:start position:0%
warranted and that there is sufficient
 
04:43:56.830 --> 04:43:56.840 align:start position:0%
reason for that
 
04:43:59.990 --> 04:44:00.000 align:start position:0%
and in Rochester's case there has not
 
04:44:04.190 --> 04:44:04.200 align:start position:0%
been a meeting that they could hold with
 
04:44:06.948 --> 04:44:06.958 align:start position:0%
less than the two people that were
 
04:44:09.170 --> 04:44:09.180 align:start position:0%
physically present at the that's because
 
04:44:13.730 --> 04:44:13.740 align:start position:0%
RSA 91a wouldn't allow it but the thing
 
04:44:18.470 --> 04:44:18.480 align:start position:0%
is is that when we look at a a group
 
04:44:21.890 --> 04:44:21.900 align:start position:0%
that is supposed to manage the
 
04:44:24.230 --> 04:44:24.240 align:start position:0%
happenings in our Police Department know
 
04:44:27.770 --> 04:44:27.780 align:start position:0%
what to expect in the budget uh know how
 
04:44:30.288 --> 04:44:30.298 align:start position:0%
many people that we need know the
 
04:44:32.330 --> 04:44:32.340 align:start position:0%
community and how things are going in
 
04:44:34.330 --> 04:44:34.340 align:start position:0%
the community and as things change
 
04:44:36.470 --> 04:44:36.480 align:start position:0%
certainly things are a whole lot
 
04:44:39.110 --> 04:44:39.120 align:start position:0%
different on Main Street in Rochester on
 
04:44:41.208 --> 04:44:41.218 align:start position:0%
January the 5th than they are July the
 
04:44:44.868 --> 04:44:44.878 align:start position:0%
5th so again there's I believe that
 
04:44:48.170 --> 04:44:48.180 align:start position:0%
there is is is sufficient reason for me
 
04:44:50.708 --> 04:44:50.718 align:start position:0%
as a city councilman in Rochester
 
04:44:54.590 --> 04:44:54.600 align:start position:0%
to expect that certain individuals be
 
04:44:57.770 --> 04:44:57.780 align:start position:0%
there at the meetings but if you are
 
04:45:00.850 --> 04:45:00.860 align:start position:0%
planning on only being in the city for
 
04:45:03.310 --> 04:45:03.320 align:start position:0%
three quarters of the year
 
04:45:07.368 --> 04:45:07.378 align:start position:0%
that I have caused to believe that I
 
04:45:08.930 --> 04:45:08.940 align:start position:0%
don't think that you're representing the
 
04:45:12.708 --> 04:45:12.718 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:21.050 --> 04:45:21.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:45:23.090 --> 04:45:23.100 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
04:45:25.010 --> 04:45:25.020 align:start position:0%
not really a question but I tend to
 
04:45:26.990 --> 04:45:27.000 align:start position:0%
agree with you about the attendance at a
 
04:45:29.628 --> 04:45:29.638 align:start position:0%
meeting if if in fact you are appointed
 
04:45:32.810 --> 04:45:32.820 align:start position:0%
to that agency or whatever it is now
 
04:45:36.650 --> 04:45:36.660 align:start position:0%
maybe we've got too many agencies but
 
04:45:39.770 --> 04:45:39.780 align:start position:0%
if you can't make meetings
 
04:45:42.890 --> 04:45:42.900 align:start position:0%
yeah then you can't make them and you
 
04:45:45.110 --> 04:45:45.120 align:start position:0%
can't participate in them you know I
 
04:45:47.690 --> 04:45:47.700 align:start position:0%
have difficulty with zoom meetings I
 
04:45:49.610 --> 04:45:49.620 align:start position:0%
have difficulty with meetings where
 
04:45:51.530 --> 04:45:51.540 align:start position:0%
you're in Florida and decide I can't
 
04:45:54.470 --> 04:45:54.480 align:start position:0%
make it but you know I don't mind if you
 
04:45:56.690 --> 04:45:56.700 align:start position:0%
want to listen but that's about all you
 
04:45:58.010 --> 04:45:58.020 align:start position:0%
should be able to do if you shouldn't be
 
04:45:59.448 --> 04:45:59.458 align:start position:0%
able to vote you shouldn't be able to
 
04:46:03.050 --> 04:46:03.060 align:start position:0%
 
04:46:05.510 --> 04:46:05.520 align:start position:0%
um any comment that I would have was in
 
04:46:07.128 --> 04:46:07.138 align:start position:0%
the legislation that you see in front of
 
04:46:10.070 --> 04:46:10.080 align:start position:0%
you I tried to be reasonable in the
 
04:46:12.530 --> 04:46:12.540 align:start position:0%
restrictions that I put on there I tried
 
04:46:15.110 --> 04:46:15.120 align:start position:0%
to recognize that people do have work
 
04:46:17.510 --> 04:46:17.520 align:start position:0%
commitments that people do have child
 
04:46:19.250 --> 04:46:19.260 align:start position:0%
care commitments and people have other
 
04:46:22.610 --> 04:46:22.620 align:start position:0%
commitments and that they still have a
 
04:46:25.788 --> 04:46:25.798 align:start position:0%
uh a right to be represented at certain
 
04:46:27.770 --> 04:46:27.780 align:start position:0%
things I just think that at certain
 
04:46:27.780 --> 04:46:28.990 align:start position:0%
things I just think that at certain
points

04:46:28.990 --> 04:46:29.000 align:start position:0%
points
 
04:46:33.590 --> 04:46:33.600 align:start position:0%
and the reason I picked 28 days was that
 
04:46:35.930 --> 04:46:35.940 align:start position:0%
you know if you were planned to be out
 
04:46:39.830 --> 04:46:39.840 align:start position:0%
of the jurisdiction in this you know my
 
04:46:42.590 --> 04:46:42.600 align:start position:0%
case it would be out of Rochester for
 
04:46:46.670 --> 04:46:46.680 align:start position:0%
more than four complete weeks that
 
04:46:50.448 --> 04:46:50.458 align:start position:0%
you don't get an option of being able to
 
04:46:54.070 --> 04:46:54.080 align:start position:0%
attend and vote Etc like like you said
 
04:46:56.990 --> 04:46:57.000 align:start position:0%
but again there's nothing in there that
 
04:46:59.470 --> 04:46:59.480 align:start position:0%
would remove them from the committee
 
04:47:03.410 --> 04:47:03.420 align:start position:0%
that I put into that legislation and
 
04:47:06.170 --> 04:47:06.180 align:start position:0%
that the voters at the end of that term
 
04:47:09.650 --> 04:47:09.660 align:start position:0%
of that uh that whoever would like to
 
04:47:12.110 --> 04:47:12.120 align:start position:0%
challenge that person would have the
 
04:47:14.628 --> 04:47:14.638 align:start position:0%
responsibility of saying this is one of
 
04:47:17.510 --> 04:47:17.520 align:start position:0%
the reasons why I think I will represent
 
04:47:21.650 --> 04:47:21.660 align:start position:0%
people of my community better
 
04:47:24.890 --> 04:47:24.900 align:start position:0%
uh representative Tripp
 
04:47:26.990 --> 04:47:27.000 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
04:47:30.590 --> 04:47:30.600 align:start position:0%
my question uh I believe at one point of
 
04:47:33.650 --> 04:47:33.660 align:start position:0%
your testimony that you said that uh
 
04:47:35.570 --> 04:47:35.580 align:start position:0%
there are a number of people that want
 
04:47:40.310 --> 04:47:40.320 align:start position:0%
to uh have much better control over uh
 
04:47:43.368 --> 04:47:43.378 align:start position:0%
attendance at meetings than is currently
 
04:47:47.810 --> 04:47:47.820 align:start position:0%
provided in RSA 91a is that correct
 
04:47:47.820 --> 04:47:49.788 align:start position:0%
provided in RSA 91a is that correct
um

04:47:49.788 --> 04:47:49.798 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:47:51.948 --> 04:47:51.958 align:start position:0%
there are people out there who would
 
04:47:56.530 --> 04:47:56.540 align:start position:0%
like to have more liberal rules in
 
04:48:00.730 --> 04:48:00.740 align:start position:0%
participation such that right now RSA
 
04:48:04.490 --> 04:48:04.500 align:start position:0%
91a requires that a quorum of the group
 
04:48:07.670 --> 04:48:07.680 align:start position:0%
be present at the fiscal location they
 
04:48:10.850 --> 04:48:10.860 align:start position:0%
would like to change that and make it so
 
04:48:12.708 --> 04:48:12.718 align:start position:0%
that it is less than a quorum that would
 
04:48:15.530 --> 04:48:15.540 align:start position:0%
have to be there again in a lot of
 
04:48:18.470 --> 04:48:18.480 align:start position:0%
committees uh what we've done in the
 
04:48:21.230 --> 04:48:21.240 align:start position:0%
past is we've put in alternates if you
 
04:48:23.690 --> 04:48:23.700 align:start position:0%
look here it's a state house and you
 
04:48:25.868 --> 04:48:25.878 align:start position:0%
look at say the
 
04:48:29.510 --> 04:48:29.520 align:start position:0%
administrative rules committee there is
 
04:48:32.270 --> 04:48:32.280 align:start position:0%
alternates that are assigned to that you
 
04:48:34.550 --> 04:48:34.560 align:start position:0%
look at the house committee for fiscal
 
04:48:36.650 --> 04:48:36.660 align:start position:0%
and there are alternates assigned to
 
04:48:39.470 --> 04:48:39.480 align:start position:0%
that and again that is a certainly a
 
04:48:43.010 --> 04:48:43.020 align:start position:0%
valid way to have the various sections
 
04:48:46.850 --> 04:48:46.860 align:start position:0%
of the community represented and still
 
04:48:50.090 --> 04:48:50.100 align:start position:0%
meet the Quorum requirements so
 
04:48:52.730 --> 04:48:52.740 align:start position:0%
you know there are others who want to be
 
04:48:56.750 --> 04:48:56.760 align:start position:0%
you know much more strict uh in their uh
 
04:48:58.850 --> 04:48:58.860 align:start position:0%
one of the things that I think you've
 
04:49:03.110 --> 04:49:03.120 align:start position:0%
got in uh uh line uh see the blind
 
04:49:05.208 --> 04:49:05.218 align:start position:0%
numbers probably aren't correct but a
 
04:49:09.650 --> 04:49:09.660 align:start position:0%
small F in Roman three uh the start off
 
04:49:12.890 --> 04:49:12.900 align:start position:0%
that with it says in person attendance
 
04:49:16.550 --> 04:49:16.560 align:start position:0%
at meetings is expected okay that is the
 
04:49:19.250 --> 04:49:19.260 align:start position:0%
expectation it doesn't say required it
 
04:49:21.830 --> 04:49:21.840 align:start position:0%
doesn't say that word was chosen very
 
04:49:25.610 --> 04:49:25.620 align:start position:0%
carefully you know so that if you agree
 
04:49:28.550 --> 04:49:28.560 align:start position:0%
to be on one of these committees is that
 
04:49:30.830 --> 04:49:30.840 align:start position:0%
there is a expectation that you will
 
04:49:32.750 --> 04:49:32.760 align:start position:0%
come to the meetings and you will be in
 
04:49:32.760 --> 04:49:33.530 align:start position:0%
come to the meetings and you will be in
person

04:49:33.530 --> 04:49:33.540 align:start position:0%
person
 
04:49:37.490 --> 04:49:37.500 align:start position:0%
follow up please yes follow up uh when I
 
04:49:41.390 --> 04:49:41.400 align:start position:0%
first read this this bill I had a hard
 
04:49:44.230 --> 04:49:44.240 align:start position:0%
time uh
 
04:49:48.288 --> 04:49:48.298 align:start position:0%
ascertaining exactly which
 
04:49:48.298 --> 04:49:51.350 align:start position:0%
ascertaining exactly which
uh

04:49:51.350 --> 04:49:51.360 align:start position:0%
 
04:49:54.890 --> 04:49:54.900 align:start position:0%
meetings this pertain to because it
 
04:49:57.470 --> 04:49:57.480 align:start position:0%
seems and I believe you said this also
 
04:50:02.030 --> 04:50:02.040 align:start position:0%
that uh you know uh municipalities uh
 
04:50:04.368 --> 04:50:04.378 align:start position:0%
have a number of committees or whatever
 
04:50:07.610 --> 04:50:07.620 align:start position:0%
that are are self-generated and they
 
04:50:10.490 --> 04:50:10.500 align:start position:0%
they have their own rules and I was I
 
04:50:14.030 --> 04:50:14.040 align:start position:0%
was a little confused as to why you know
 
04:50:18.550 --> 04:50:18.560 align:start position:0%
we had this section in this bill but uh
 
04:50:22.368 --> 04:50:22.378 align:start position:0%
so is would you say that
 
04:50:24.890 --> 04:50:24.900 align:start position:0%
would be applicable
 
04:50:27.170 --> 04:50:27.180 align:start position:0%
the the the municipalities should make
 
04:50:30.770 --> 04:50:30.780 align:start position:0%
their attendance rules Roman 3 of the
 
04:50:34.610 --> 04:50:34.620 align:start position:0%
RSA applies to all meetings that are
 
04:50:39.050 --> 04:50:39.060 align:start position:0%
subject to RSA 91a if you choose
 
04:50:42.288 --> 04:50:42.298 align:start position:0%
uh to go back and add a section four or
 
04:50:45.050 --> 04:50:45.060 align:start position:0%
however you would do it to allow the
 
04:50:47.150 --> 04:50:47.160 align:start position:0%
communities for meetings that they are
 
04:50:50.530 --> 04:50:50.540 align:start position:0%
responsible for to have less than
 
04:50:54.350 --> 04:50:54.360 align:start position:0%
by changing the statute then that would
 
04:50:57.050 --> 04:50:57.060 align:start position:0%
apply to the Committees that they are
 
04:50:59.150 --> 04:50:59.160 align:start position:0%
responsible for so if you've got a
 
04:51:01.670 --> 04:51:01.680 align:start position:0%
economic development committee and you
 
04:51:05.330 --> 04:51:05.340 align:start position:0%
want to allow them to have less than a
 
04:51:07.430 --> 04:51:07.440 align:start position:0%
quorum there then you would write that
 
04:51:10.970 --> 04:51:10.980 align:start position:0%
into the statute or the ordinance I
 
04:51:14.150 --> 04:51:14.160 align:start position:0%
should say that is would be required for
 
04:51:16.250 --> 04:51:16.260 align:start position:0%
them to allow them
 
04:51:18.230 --> 04:51:18.240 align:start position:0%
thank you uh representative Smith did
 
04:51:19.910 --> 04:51:19.920 align:start position:0%
you have a question
 
04:51:21.830 --> 04:51:21.840 align:start position:0%
representative Morgan
 
04:51:23.750 --> 04:51:23.760 align:start position:0%
um yes oh
 
04:51:25.368 --> 04:51:25.378 align:start position:0%
of course this may be something that
 
04:51:27.650 --> 04:51:27.660 align:start position:0%
perhaps if we took it out it would
 
04:51:29.570 --> 04:51:29.580 align:start position:0%
provide the committee of conference but
 
04:51:31.910 --> 04:51:31.920 align:start position:0%
um what's I'm kind of baffled as to the
 
04:51:33.350 --> 04:51:33.360 align:start position:0%
thing about why
 
04:51:35.750 --> 04:51:35.760 align:start position:0%
uh it's not it's never a legitimate
 
04:51:37.430 --> 04:51:37.440 align:start position:0%
reason unless it's a medical reason when
 
04:51:39.470 --> 04:51:39.480 align:start position:0%
you're out of state since um you know
 
04:51:39.480 --> 04:51:40.730 align:start position:0%
you're out of state since um you know
people

04:51:40.730 --> 04:51:40.740 align:start position:0%
people
 
04:51:44.510 --> 04:51:44.520 align:start position:0%
Cannon we uh reps and other officials we
 
04:51:46.368 --> 04:51:46.378 align:start position:0%
do like travel to other states for all
 
04:51:48.650 --> 04:51:48.660 align:start position:0%
kinds of uh all kinds of reasons I'm
 
04:51:50.930 --> 04:51:50.940 align:start position:0%
thinking of a of a
 
04:51:52.788 --> 04:51:52.798 align:start position:0%
board that I'm on where there's two
 
04:51:55.788 --> 04:51:55.798 align:start position:0%
legislative members and um
 
04:51:58.128 --> 04:51:58.138 align:start position:0%
one month we actually of course both of
 
04:51:59.510 --> 04:51:59.520 align:start position:0%
us actually
 
04:52:01.430 --> 04:52:01.440 align:start position:0%
went attend the meeting remotely two
 
04:52:02.868 --> 04:52:02.878 align:start position:0%
months in a row which is also not
 
04:52:05.510 --> 04:52:05.520 align:start position:0%
allowed but um also the second month we
 
04:52:07.730 --> 04:52:07.740 align:start position:0%
were both in state and uh but the first
 
04:52:09.650 --> 04:52:09.660 align:start position:0%
month um I happened to be
 
04:52:11.628 --> 04:52:11.638 align:start position:0%
in New York City and he happened to be
 
04:52:14.208 --> 04:52:14.218 align:start position:0%
in South Carolina so I'm not sure
 
04:52:16.128 --> 04:52:16.138 align:start position:0%
why our reasons for skipping the one
 
04:52:18.050 --> 04:52:18.060 align:start position:0%
where we're out of state are
 
04:52:20.030 --> 04:52:20.040 align:start position:0%
less legitimate why that's more of a
 
04:52:22.310 --> 04:52:22.320 align:start position:0%
problem than the time that we didn't
 
04:52:24.050 --> 04:52:24.060 align:start position:0%
come in when in fact we were both like
 
04:52:25.610 --> 04:52:25.620 align:start position:0%
fairly close to the physical Location
 
04:52:28.550 --> 04:52:28.560 align:start position:0%
meeting in Concord but just it made more
 
04:52:30.110 --> 04:52:30.120 align:start position:0%
sense for us for the through relatively
 
04:52:32.690 --> 04:52:32.700 align:start position:0%
short meeting we were attending to
 
04:52:35.030 --> 04:52:35.040 align:start position:0%
um do it by zoom and then fit it in with
 
04:52:37.670 --> 04:52:37.680 align:start position:0%
our other business the way why is that a
 
04:52:39.050 --> 04:52:39.060 align:start position:0%
problem so why is that a problem I'm
 
04:52:41.030 --> 04:52:41.040 align:start position:0%
trying I would be happy to help you
 
04:52:43.550 --> 04:52:43.560 align:start position:0%
interpret what the words here on the
 
04:52:46.128 --> 04:52:46.138 align:start position:0%
page are remember that uh consent
 
04:52:49.368 --> 04:52:49.378 align:start position:0%
absence at consecutive meetings uh can
 
04:52:51.050 --> 04:52:51.060 align:start position:0%
be allowed by the chairman for
 
04:52:53.810 --> 04:52:53.820 align:start position:0%
legitimate reasons okay the thing about
 
04:52:56.208 --> 04:52:56.218 align:start position:0%
being out of state and you notice that
 
04:53:00.230 --> 04:53:00.240 align:start position:0%
in the line for that it says 28
 
04:53:03.770 --> 04:53:03.780 align:start position:0%
consecutive days so if you are not in
 
04:53:07.150 --> 04:53:07.160 align:start position:0%
the state for a month or four weeks okay
 
04:53:10.610 --> 04:53:10.620 align:start position:0%
that is where I drew the line if you're
 
04:53:13.190 --> 04:53:13.200 align:start position:0%
out of state back in the state out of
 
04:53:15.770 --> 04:53:15.780 align:start position:0%
state back in the state that's not 28
 
04:53:18.590 --> 04:53:18.600 align:start position:0%
consecutive days you know if you miss a
 
04:53:21.288 --> 04:53:21.298 align:start position:0%
meeting here and you are back and forth
 
04:53:23.448 --> 04:53:23.458 align:start position:0%
and miss a meeting there that's covered
 
04:53:24.410 --> 04:53:24.420 align:start position:0%
by the
 
04:53:27.530 --> 04:53:27.540 align:start position:0%
probably the upper portion of that
 
04:53:30.590 --> 04:53:30.600 align:start position:0%
paragraph where the chair uh will
 
04:53:34.750 --> 04:53:34.760 align:start position:0%
evaluate your reason uh for not
 
04:53:37.610 --> 04:53:37.620 align:start position:0%
non-attendance and he will either say
 
04:53:40.310 --> 04:53:40.320 align:start position:0%
yes it's legitimate or not legitimate
 
04:53:43.490 --> 04:53:43.500 align:start position:0%
and certainly we all know that you you
 
04:53:45.788 --> 04:53:45.798 align:start position:0%
know as a member of committees you can
 
04:53:48.948 --> 04:53:48.958 align:start position:0%
question the rule of the chair and you
 
04:53:52.010 --> 04:53:52.020 align:start position:0%
know has to have it voted on and all
 
04:53:54.550 --> 04:53:54.560 align:start position:0%
that good stuff none of that goes away
 
04:53:58.850 --> 04:53:58.860 align:start position:0%
so we do protect your rights we don't uh
 
04:54:02.208 --> 04:54:02.218 align:start position:0%
say that you know it's we're looking at
 
04:54:04.610 --> 04:54:04.620 align:start position:0%
the people who are are leading the state
 
04:54:07.250 --> 04:54:07.260 align:start position:0%
for an extended period of time and if
 
04:54:09.590 --> 04:54:09.600 align:start position:0%
it's for medical reasons if it's for
 
04:54:11.350 --> 04:54:11.360 align:start position:0%
something else
 
04:54:15.708 --> 04:54:15.718 align:start position:0%
then it would need to be evaluated but a
 
04:54:20.330 --> 04:54:20.340 align:start position:0%
vacation to go to uh you know Miami
 
04:54:24.708 --> 04:54:24.718 align:start position:0%
Beach Florida to me does not if I over
 
04:54:28.128 --> 04:54:28.138 align:start position:0%
the chair that it would not be allowed
 
04:54:30.770 --> 04:54:30.780 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
04:54:33.170 --> 04:54:33.180 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much senator
 
04:54:35.090 --> 04:54:35.100 align:start position:0%
next I'm going to call on representative
 
04:54:38.810 --> 04:54:38.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:38.820 --> 04:54:47.270 align:start position:0%
 
foreign

04:54:47.270 --> 04:54:47.280 align:start position:0%
 
04:54:49.310 --> 04:54:49.320 align:start position:0%
thank you very much Mr chairman members
 
04:54:50.628 --> 04:54:50.638 align:start position:0%
of the committee for the record my name
 
04:54:52.550 --> 04:54:52.560 align:start position:0%
is Dan McGuire I represent the town of
 
04:54:52.560 --> 04:54:54.310 align:start position:0%
is Dan McGuire I represent the town of
Epsom

04:54:54.310 --> 04:54:54.320 align:start position:0%
Epsom
 
04:54:57.708 --> 04:54:57.718 align:start position:0%
I sat next to Senator gray for two years
 
04:54:59.690 --> 04:54:59.700 align:start position:0%
in the house so and obviously we think
 
04:55:01.670 --> 04:55:01.680 align:start position:0%
alike because
 
04:55:04.310 --> 04:55:04.320 align:start position:0%
this bill is perfect as far as I'm
 
04:55:07.310 --> 04:55:07.320 align:start position:0%
concerned it's written exactly for the
 
04:55:10.550 --> 04:55:10.560 align:start position:0%
situation that I find myself in in my
 
04:55:13.250 --> 04:55:13.260 align:start position:0%
town I'm a member of our planning board
 
04:55:16.788 --> 04:55:16.798 align:start position:0%
and we have one of our members who lives
 
04:55:19.250 --> 04:55:19.260 align:start position:0%
in Florida over the winter
 
04:55:22.128 --> 04:55:22.138 align:start position:0%
and wants to participate in meetings and
 
04:55:24.110 --> 04:55:24.120 align:start position:0%
has been so for the past three four
 
04:55:28.070 --> 04:55:28.080 align:start position:0%
months there in the meeting on Zoom
 
04:55:31.150 --> 04:55:31.160 align:start position:0%
and the problem is you know maybe
 
04:55:34.610 --> 04:55:34.620 align:start position:0%
sometime in the future virtual reality
 
04:55:36.948 --> 04:55:36.958 align:start position:0%
will get to a point where it's just like
 
04:55:38.570 --> 04:55:38.580 align:start position:0%
being in the same room but the problem
 
04:55:40.010 --> 04:55:40.020 align:start position:0%
is it's not
 
04:55:43.070 --> 04:55:43.080 align:start position:0%
so right now when we have a meeting our
 
04:55:45.410 --> 04:55:45.420 align:start position:0%
chair is constantly turning to this
 
04:55:48.830 --> 04:55:48.840 align:start position:0%
person and saying did you hear that do
 
04:55:50.868 --> 04:55:50.878 align:start position:0%
you have any comments and then we have
 
04:55:53.750 --> 04:55:53.760 align:start position:0%
to wait for them to unmute and say I'm
 
04:55:57.110 --> 04:55:57.120 align:start position:0%
all set or you know whatever and
 
04:55:59.750 --> 04:55:59.760 align:start position:0%
um and the fact that all because they're
 
04:56:02.270 --> 04:56:02.280 align:start position:0%
on Zoom all of our votes are roll calls
 
04:56:04.970 --> 04:56:04.980 align:start position:0%
normally all of our votes are unanimous
 
04:56:08.690 --> 04:56:08.700 align:start position:0%
they're very quick but now what's your
 
04:56:11.628 --> 04:56:11.638 align:start position:0%
vote Yes Yes you know I think it adds
 
04:56:15.470 --> 04:56:15.480 align:start position:0%
half an hour to every meeting so so the
 
04:56:17.810 --> 04:56:17.820 align:start position:0%
time of the people in the meeting and
 
04:56:19.550 --> 04:56:19.560 align:start position:0%
all the people in the public who come to
 
04:56:21.410 --> 04:56:21.420 align:start position:0%
see us and the applicants and all that
 
04:56:25.010 --> 04:56:25.020 align:start position:0%
you know is wasted by half an hour
 
04:56:27.470 --> 04:56:27.480 align:start position:0%
per you know just because this one
 
04:56:31.070 --> 04:56:31.080 align:start position:0%
person wants to you know be away for so
 
04:56:33.550 --> 04:56:33.560 align:start position:0%
long so I think this is perfect because
 
04:56:36.650 --> 04:56:36.660 align:start position:0%
it it makes it clear that this kind of
 
04:56:40.610 --> 04:56:40.620 align:start position:0%
thing uh is is should not be allowed but
 
04:56:42.230 --> 04:56:42.240 align:start position:0%
the occasional special condition
 
04:56:46.550 --> 04:56:46.560 align:start position:0%
whatever fine you know so it's it's a
 
04:56:49.070 --> 04:56:49.080 align:start position:0%
light enough touch but it but it gets
 
04:56:50.750 --> 04:56:50.760 align:start position:0%
the job done and the problem is if you
 
04:56:53.030 --> 04:56:53.040 align:start position:0%
say to us well why doesn't your chair
 
04:56:54.650 --> 04:56:54.660 align:start position:0%
just tell this person they can't
 
04:56:57.470 --> 04:56:57.480 align:start position:0%
participate right but the problem is you
 
04:56:59.230 --> 04:56:59.240 align:start position:0%
know we know each other we're friends
 
04:57:03.410 --> 04:57:03.420 align:start position:0%
it's tough to uh you know be the bad guy
 
04:57:06.470 --> 04:57:06.480 align:start position:0%
so let the legislature be the bad guy in
 
04:57:08.570 --> 04:57:08.580 align:start position:0%
this case and
 
04:57:10.910 --> 04:57:10.920 align:start position:0%
um and and stop this practice because
 
04:57:15.050 --> 04:57:15.060 align:start position:0%
it's really uh it's unproductive thank
 
04:57:17.690 --> 04:57:17.700 align:start position:0%
you very much Mr chairman questions for
 
04:57:19.310 --> 04:57:19.320 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
04:57:22.070 --> 04:57:22.080 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you
 
04:57:29.810 --> 04:57:29.820 align:start position:0%
 
04:57:31.850 --> 04:57:31.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair nature Grace for the
 
04:57:33.708 --> 04:57:33.718 align:start position:0%
municipal Association
 
04:57:35.390 --> 04:57:35.400 align:start position:0%
um as you've as you've already heard we
 
04:57:37.430 --> 04:57:37.440 align:start position:0%
object to the bill that came over from
 
04:57:39.470 --> 04:57:39.480 align:start position:0%
the Senate I don't think this is ready
 
04:57:42.170 --> 04:57:42.180 align:start position:0%
for prime time the uh committee had a
 
04:57:43.788 --> 04:57:43.798 align:start position:0%
number of concerns
 
04:57:45.948 --> 04:57:45.958 align:start position:0%
uh one concern I didn't hear raised but
 
04:57:47.990 --> 04:57:48.000 align:start position:0%
I do want to point out to the committee
 
04:57:51.110 --> 04:57:51.120 align:start position:0%
is you've already heard a couple of uh
 
04:57:53.570 --> 04:57:53.580 align:start position:0%
remote attendance bills and set a clear
 
04:57:55.010 --> 04:57:55.020 align:start position:0%
policy out of this committee about
 
04:57:56.270 --> 04:57:56.280 align:start position:0%
what's appropriate and what's not
 
04:57:58.550 --> 04:57:58.560 align:start position:0%
appropriate and you ended up passing
 
04:58:00.550 --> 04:58:00.560 align:start position:0%
House Bill 308
 
04:58:03.350 --> 04:58:03.360 align:start position:0%
you a recommended passage and that
 
04:58:05.448 --> 04:58:05.458 align:start position:0%
passed out of the house recommended that
 
04:58:08.030 --> 04:58:08.040 align:start position:0%
house bill 254 be killed and that was in
 
04:58:09.730 --> 04:58:09.740 align:start position:0%
fact killed by the house
 
04:58:12.770 --> 04:58:12.780 align:start position:0%
and what this bill would do is modify
 
04:58:15.650 --> 04:58:15.660 align:start position:0%
some of the same provisions of the same
 
04:58:18.948 --> 04:58:18.958 align:start position:0%
statute so I don't know how much that
 
04:58:21.590 --> 04:58:21.600 align:start position:0%
would affect 308 I wasn't involved in
 
04:58:23.990 --> 04:58:24.000 align:start position:0%
those discussions because I'm I don't
 
04:58:25.788 --> 04:58:25.798 align:start position:0%
represent any Statewide boards and that
 
04:58:28.550 --> 04:58:28.560 align:start position:0%
was particularly Statewide boards but I
 
04:58:30.050 --> 04:58:30.060 align:start position:0%
think this committee is has created a
 
04:58:33.590 --> 04:58:33.600 align:start position:0%
clear bipartisan policy on that so I
 
04:58:34.670 --> 04:58:34.680 align:start position:0%
think it's more appropriate for this
 
04:58:37.368 --> 04:58:37.378 align:start position:0%
committee to either itl or retain this
 
04:58:38.750 --> 04:58:38.760 align:start position:0%
bill if you'd like to work on this over
 
04:58:40.730 --> 04:58:40.740 align:start position:0%
the summer I've had a brief conversation
 
04:58:43.190 --> 04:58:43.200 align:start position:0%
with right to know New Hampshire and I I
 
04:58:44.990 --> 04:58:45.000 align:start position:0%
would love to have the opportunity to
 
04:58:48.410 --> 04:58:48.420 align:start position:0%
work with them to refine kind of what we
 
04:58:50.330 --> 04:58:50.340 align:start position:0%
would expect at meetings
 
04:58:53.628 --> 04:58:53.638 align:start position:0%
in terms of any sort of tenants or
 
04:58:55.730 --> 04:58:55.740 align:start position:0%
anything else
 
04:58:58.070 --> 04:58:58.080 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure that this bill is written
 
04:59:00.170 --> 04:59:00.180 align:start position:0%
adds a whole lot to the right to no law
 
04:59:02.448 --> 04:59:02.458 align:start position:0%
it it already provides as you would
 
04:59:06.050 --> 04:59:06.060 align:start position:0%
actually see on page one lines 19-21
 
04:59:07.788 --> 04:59:07.798 align:start position:0%
that each member participating
 
04:59:10.570 --> 04:59:10.580 align:start position:0%
electronically or otherwise most people
 
04:59:12.530 --> 04:59:12.540 align:start position:0%
simultaneously hear each other and speak
 
04:59:14.090 --> 04:59:14.100 align:start position:0%
to each other during the meeting and
 
04:59:15.590 --> 04:59:15.600 align:start position:0%
she'll be audible otherwise discernible
 
04:59:17.150 --> 04:59:17.160 align:start position:0%
to the public in attendance the meetings
 
04:59:19.670 --> 04:59:19.680 align:start position:0%
locations so clearly the chair has some
 
04:59:21.708 --> 04:59:21.718 align:start position:0%
responsibility there I I mean
 
04:59:24.230 --> 04:59:24.240 align:start position:0%
realistically you've seen me tilted
 
04:59:26.628 --> 04:59:26.638 align:start position:0%
windmills uh several times now for
 
04:59:28.190 --> 04:59:28.200 align:start position:0%
remote means and changes to different
 
04:59:31.730 --> 04:59:31.740 align:start position:0%
Provisions I think either it's time to
 
04:59:34.090 --> 04:59:34.100 align:start position:0%
to bring some stakeholders together
 
04:59:36.350 --> 04:59:36.360 align:start position:0%
or give us the opportunity to do that
 
04:59:39.770 --> 04:59:39.780 align:start position:0%
over the next couple a couple years and
 
04:59:42.830 --> 04:59:42.840 align:start position:0%
then come back with a refined and
 
04:59:42.840 --> 04:59:43.430 align:start position:0%
then come back with a refined and
um

04:59:43.430 --> 04:59:43.440 align:start position:0%
um
 
04:59:45.708 --> 04:59:45.718 align:start position:0%
well thought out proposal
 
04:59:47.810 --> 04:59:47.820 align:start position:0%
happy to take questions questions for
 
04:59:49.368 --> 04:59:49.378 align:start position:0%
this Witness
 
04:59:54.470 --> 04:59:54.480 align:start position:0%
 
04:59:56.350 --> 04:59:56.360 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chairman I have a question
 
04:59:59.570 --> 04:59:59.580 align:start position:0%

05:00:03.170 --> 05:00:03.180 align:start position:0%
administration or the nhma as far as a
 
05:00:04.788 --> 05:00:04.798 align:start position:0%
number of people who are either
 
05:00:06.948 --> 05:00:06.958 align:start position:0%
full-time or almost full-time in the
 
05:00:06.958 --> 05:00:07.910 align:start position:0%

office

the executive director

um
 
05:00:20.390 --> 05:00:20.400 align:start position:0%
we have some hybrid work uh depending on
 
05:00:24.350 --> 05:00:24.360 align:start position:0%
uh individuals job responsibilities

remote like webinars we do some in
 
05:00:31.490 --> 05:00:31.500 align:start position:0%
person it really depends on the topic
 
05:00:32.990 --> 05:00:33.000 align:start position:0%
and the appropriateness and that's
 
05:00:35.390 --> 05:00:35.400 align:start position:0%
decided and based on what the subject is
 
05:00:36.948 --> 05:00:36.958 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:00:39.230 --> 05:00:39.240 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
05:00:41.150 --> 05:00:41.160 align:start position:0%
yes representative Manos
 
05:00:43.128 --> 05:00:43.138 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair thank you for taking
 
05:00:46.310 --> 05:00:46.320 align:start position:0%
my question I understand your general
 
05:00:48.708 --> 05:00:48.718 align:start position:0%
objection and your desire to retain it
 
05:00:51.050 --> 05:00:51.060 align:start position:0%
or I tell it I'm wondering if you could
 
05:00:53.868 --> 05:00:53.878 align:start position:0%
articulate your specific objections to
 
05:00:55.610 --> 05:00:55.620 align:start position:0%
the bill as written
 
05:00:57.708 --> 05:00:57.718 align:start position:0%
thank you
 
05:01:00.890 --> 05:01:00.900 align:start position:0%
um well I mean the right to know law
 
05:01:03.050 --> 05:01:03.060 align:start position:0%
already kind of anticipates that you'll
 
05:01:05.510 --> 05:01:05.520 align:start position:0%
have uh in-person attendance right
 
05:01:08.470 --> 05:01:08.480 align:start position:0%
because unlike on lines 10 on page one
 
05:01:10.670 --> 05:01:10.680 align:start position:0%
except an emergency a quorum of the
 
05:01:12.050 --> 05:01:12.060 align:start position:0%
public body shall be physically present
 
05:01:13.730 --> 05:01:13.740 align:start position:0%
the location specified in the meeting
 
05:01:15.070 --> 05:01:15.080 align:start position:0%
notice so
 
05:01:17.990 --> 05:01:18.000 align:start position:0%
already accepting emergencies which is
 
05:01:20.570 --> 05:01:20.580 align:start position:0%
defined elsewhere in
 
05:01:22.868 --> 05:01:22.878 align:start position:0%
um the next line down
 
05:01:25.310 --> 05:01:25.320 align:start position:0%
you already have
 
05:01:27.350 --> 05:01:27.360 align:start position:0%
you know expect people to show up and
 
05:01:29.690 --> 05:01:29.700 align:start position:0%
participate and that's part of either
 
05:01:32.570 --> 05:01:32.580 align:start position:0%
running for office or getting appointed
 
05:01:34.010 --> 05:01:34.020 align:start position:0%
to a position
 
05:01:36.170 --> 05:01:36.180 align:start position:0%
um and we don't do that presumably
 
05:01:37.788 --> 05:01:37.798 align:start position:0%
either the voters are not going to
 
05:01:39.230 --> 05:01:39.240 align:start position:0%
reelect you next time around because
 
05:01:40.610 --> 05:01:40.620 align:start position:0%
they know you didn't show up and do your
 
05:01:40.620 --> 05:01:41.930 align:start position:0%
they know you didn't show up and do your
job

05:01:41.930 --> 05:01:41.940 align:start position:0%
job
 
05:01:43.250 --> 05:01:43.260 align:start position:0%
um or you're not going to get
 
05:01:44.930 --> 05:01:44.940 align:start position:0%
reappointed because people know that you
 
05:01:46.850 --> 05:01:46.860 align:start position:0%
didn't show up and do your job whoever
 
05:01:49.670 --> 05:01:49.680 align:start position:0%
the appointing authority is so
 
05:01:52.490 --> 05:01:52.500 align:start position:0%
I'm not sure how much this
 
05:01:55.430 --> 05:01:55.440 align:start position:0%
would add to it other than that 28-day
 
05:01:55.440 --> 05:01:58.310 align:start position:0%
would add to it other than that 28-day
restriction

05:01:58.310 --> 05:01:58.320 align:start position:0%
restriction
 
05:02:01.970 --> 05:02:01.980 align:start position:0%
other questions for this Witness
 
05:02:03.770 --> 05:02:03.780 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
05:02:05.868 --> 05:02:05.878 align:start position:0%
you uh next I'm going to call on
 
05:02:16.970 --> 05:02:16.980 align:start position:0%
 
05:02:19.128 --> 05:02:19.138 align:start position:0%
good afternoon Judiciary Committee
 
05:02:21.110 --> 05:02:21.120 align:start position:0%
members my name is Catherine Coco I am
 
05:02:22.368 --> 05:02:22.378 align:start position:0%
the President of right to know New
 
05:02:25.730 --> 05:02:25.740 align:start position:0%
Hampshire a citizen-based 100 volunteer
 
05:02:28.368 --> 05:02:28.378 align:start position:0%
organization that provides advocacy
 
05:02:30.288 --> 05:02:30.298 align:start position:0%
education and assistance to those who
 
05:02:31.850 --> 05:02:31.860 align:start position:0%
are seeking access to public information
 
05:02:33.830 --> 05:02:33.840 align:start position:0%
and increase transparency in government
 
05:02:33.840 --> 05:02:35.810 align:start position:0%
and increase transparency in government
operations

05:02:35.810 --> 05:02:35.820 align:start position:0%
operations
 
05:02:37.850 --> 05:02:37.860 align:start position:0%
right to know New Hampshire is opposed
 
05:02:41.030 --> 05:02:41.040 align:start position:0%
to SB 250 both as originally proposed
 
05:02:43.430 --> 05:02:43.440 align:start position:0%
and as amended by the senate in its
 
05:02:45.110 --> 05:02:45.120 align:start position:0%
current state we feel that this bill
 
05:02:46.970 --> 05:02:46.980 align:start position:0%
does not address any of the identified
 
05:02:50.090 --> 05:02:50.100 align:start position:0%
issues with 91a around remote meetings
 
05:02:52.070 --> 05:02:52.080 align:start position:0%
and unnecessarily complicates the bill
 
05:02:52.080 --> 05:02:53.868 align:start position:0%
and unnecessarily complicates the bill
language

05:02:53.868 --> 05:02:53.878 align:start position:0%
language
 
05:02:55.550 --> 05:02:55.560 align:start position:0%
um and this this was an issue I think
 
05:02:57.288 --> 05:02:57.298 align:start position:0%
that we also raised with this Committee
 
05:03:00.050 --> 05:03:00.060 align:start position:0%
in relation to HB 308 and the idea of
 
05:03:03.530 --> 05:03:03.540 align:start position:0%
stratifying how 91a applies to state
 
05:03:06.948 --> 05:03:06.958 align:start position:0%
boards separately as well I'm happy to
 
05:03:08.390 --> 05:03:08.400 align:start position:0%
provide the committee with a copy of an
 
05:03:09.948 --> 05:03:09.958 align:start position:0%
issue brief that we put together on
 
05:03:11.810 --> 05:03:11.820 align:start position:0%
remote meetings which identifies the key
 
05:03:13.610 --> 05:03:13.620 align:start position:0%
issues that we think do need to be
 
05:03:15.050 --> 05:03:15.060 align:start position:0%
addressed around this very important
 
05:03:17.628 --> 05:03:17.638 align:start position:0%
topic the location of remote members and
 
05:03:19.850 --> 05:03:19.860 align:start position:0%
the language such as included in section
 
05:03:22.490 --> 05:03:22.500 align:start position:0%
f are not among those priorities
 
05:03:24.470 --> 05:03:24.480 align:start position:0%
the original language of SB 250
 
05:03:26.390 --> 05:03:26.400 align:start position:0%
addressed access to remote meetings but
 
05:03:28.490 --> 05:03:28.500 align:start position:0%
only by members of the public body while
 
05:03:30.170 --> 05:03:30.180 align:start position:0%
we found that language to be somewhat
 
05:03:31.670 --> 05:03:31.680 align:start position:0%
problematic we want to take this
 
05:03:33.350 --> 05:03:33.360 align:start position:0%
opportunity to remind the committee and
 
05:03:34.850 --> 05:03:34.860 align:start position:0%
anyone who's interested in remote
 
05:03:36.830 --> 05:03:36.840 align:start position:0%
meetings that we are happy to work with
 
05:03:39.470 --> 05:03:39.480 align:start position:0%
any legislator a legislator on Bill
 
05:03:41.570 --> 05:03:41.580 align:start position:0%
language that would address the concerns
 
05:03:43.190 --> 05:03:43.200 align:start position:0%
that we've identified and meet any
 
05:03:44.868 --> 05:03:44.878 align:start position:0%
sponsor objectives around improving
 
05:03:47.448 --> 05:03:47.458 align:start position:0%
remote access this in just this session
 
05:03:49.368 --> 05:03:49.378 align:start position:0%
I have personally discussed the need for
 
05:03:51.170 --> 05:03:51.180 align:start position:0%
such an approach to remote meetings on
 
05:03:52.850 --> 05:03:52.860 align:start position:0%
at least five different remote meeting
 
05:03:54.470 --> 05:03:54.480 align:start position:0%
bills this session
 
05:03:56.330 --> 05:03:56.340 align:start position:0%
and I'm happy to take any questions you
 
05:03:58.010 --> 05:03:58.020 align:start position:0%
may have right questions for this
 
05:03:58.020 --> 05:04:00.110 align:start position:0%
may have right questions for this
Witness

05:04:00.110 --> 05:04:00.120 align:start position:0%
Witness
 
05:04:02.030 --> 05:04:02.040 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you very much thank
 
05:04:12.050 --> 05:04:12.060 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:13.850 --> 05:04:13.860 align:start position:0%
thank you Mr chair my name is Kate

Horgan I'm representing the New
 
05:04:17.270 --> 05:04:17.280 align:start position:0%
Hampshire Association of counties we are
 
05:04:19.610 --> 05:04:19.620 align:start position:0%
also opposed to this bill
 
05:04:21.288 --> 05:04:21.298 align:start position:0%
um while we appreciate Senator Gray's
 
05:04:22.970 --> 05:04:22.980 align:start position:0%
work on the bill we also do not agree
 
05:04:24.590 --> 05:04:24.600 align:start position:0%
that the language is ready for prime
 
05:04:27.890 --> 05:04:27.900 align:start position:0%
time uh the nhma highlighted many of our
 
05:04:29.690 --> 05:04:29.700 align:start position:0%
concerns we don't think that this
 
05:04:31.970 --> 05:04:31.980 align:start position:0%
specifically clarifies anything that is
 
05:04:33.708 --> 05:04:33.718 align:start position:0%
currently in statute that is not already
 
05:04:35.390 --> 05:04:35.400 align:start position:0%
covered we're happy to work with any
 
05:04:37.430 --> 05:04:37.440 align:start position:0%
stakeholders if the committee deems it
 
05:04:39.770 --> 05:04:39.780 align:start position:0%
fit to retain this bill over the summer
 
05:04:42.110 --> 05:04:42.120 align:start position:0%
and try and get some clarifying language
 
05:04:44.150 --> 05:04:44.160 align:start position:0%
that works for everyone and I am happy
 
05:04:46.910 --> 05:04:46.920 align:start position:0%
to take any questions
 
05:04:48.948 --> 05:04:48.958 align:start position:0%
questions for this Witness
 
05:04:50.810 --> 05:04:50.820 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
 
05:04:50.820 --> 05:04:53.330 align:start position:0%
seeing none thank you thank you very
much

05:04:53.330 --> 05:04:53.340 align:start position:0%
 
05:04:53.340 --> 05:05:01.310 align:start position:0%
 
second

05:05:01.310 --> 05:05:01.320 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:03.530 --> 05:05:03.540 align:start position:0%
is there anyone else who wishes to
 
05:05:08.810 --> 05:05:08.820 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:10.670 --> 05:05:10.680 align:start position:0%
seeing none I'm going to close the
 
05:05:12.288 --> 05:05:12.298 align:start position:0%
hearing on
 
05:05:47.930 --> 05:05:47.940 align:start position:0%
 
05:05:51.350 --> 05:05:51.360 align:start position:0%
so um we're done for the day and I guess
 
05:05:53.570 --> 05:05:53.580 align:start position:0%
we'll see everyone next Wednesday we
 
05:05:55.910 --> 05:05:55.920 align:start position:0%
have three bills on
 
05:05:58.610 --> 05:05:58.620 align:start position:0%
uh and I think those are my my
 
05:06:01.310 --> 05:06:01.320 align:start position:0%
impression is that one and maybe two of
 
05:06:01.320 --> 05:06:02.570 align:start position:0%
impression is that one and maybe two of
them

05:06:02.570 --> 05:06:02.580 align:start position:0%
them
 
05:06:06.230 --> 05:06:06.240 align:start position:0%
um will take uh we'll take you know I I
 
05:06:07.730 --> 05:06:07.740 align:start position:0%
suspect we're gonna have several
 
05:06:09.050 --> 05:06:09.060 align:start position:0%
witnesses so even though it seems like
 
05:06:11.570 --> 05:06:11.580 align:start position:0%
we only have three bills on uh we may be
 
05:06:14.690 --> 05:06:14.700 align:start position:0%
here for a while next Wednesday
 
05:06:17.890 --> 05:06:17.900 align:start position:0%
yes when do we start executing bills
 
05:06:21.350 --> 05:06:21.360 align:start position:0%
May 3rd we're gonna we're gonna exec all
 
05:06:29.810 --> 05:06:29.820 align:start position:0%
